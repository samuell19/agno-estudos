I don't know anything. I swear. So you live in vain. Help! Do it! Help! Turn the engine on! We're right on time. What do you think about this Spider business? - We have to be patient. - You're right, sir. Let's meet them at the customs. We've issued orders. They'll pass without ID check. None of them should be recognised. There they are. You speak Turkish very well. Let's cut to the point. So you think Spider and his gang are in Turkey, Captain America. Yes, sir. We're sure. That's why we came to you. Mr. Santo, you claim that the Spider gang put the fake dollars... ...into circulation in Mexico. Could you explain? Our investigation revealed that the mafia had nothing to do with it. Some rich folks with ties to the mafia have been ripped off too. There's only one gang that could pull off such a big con, without the mafia. And that is the bloodthirsty Spider gang from the Far East. In brief, first: Spider smuggles historical artefacts from Turkey to America. Second: They sell these artefacts to antique dealers at a cheap price. Third: Then he buys them at a very high price... ...by using his men. But he pays with fake dollars. That way Spider gets millions of dollars... ...and the artefacts too. And the fake dollars are put into circulation in an indirect way. In America, Mexico and Brazil. Throughout the continent. Some research of our agency has become more valuable since you applied. Chief Orhan will work with you and provide you with info and clues. What kind of clues? For instance, there's a suspicious yacht in the Tarabya bay. Some foreigners are here for a fashion show. And there's an ad in the papers for precious antiques. The address is a post box. Spider is being very cautious. Adios mafia. - Both of them are from the mob. - It's getting hot. It's obvious that Spider is here. The mafia is after him. Let's go to the yacht right away. Santo stands watch at the post box. And Julia is at the fashion show... I have another question. Why are you putting on masks and outfits during duty? Spider is a child minded lunatic. He always wears a mask. When he sees someone else wearing a mask, he wants to destroy them My special outfit is bullet proof. I see. Put her into the car and take her to the yacht. Higher, higher. Swing higher. - Keep on watching out. - Yes, sir. Let's go. Turn back, quick. What happened? Julia is in the car in front of us. They're moving away. We have a tail. Hit the floor, let's beat it. Stop here. They took a turn, this means we're close to their hideout. Probably. - They've stopped. Ready? - Yes. Let's go. We've lost them good. Shut up. Hello. Hello, boss. This is Bekir. We brought the girl we caught at the show to the depot up the hills. Nadja told you to take her to the yacht. We were being followed but lost them. - We had to come here. - Fine. - I'll be there in no time. - All right. I'll take the car and go to the bay. Let's not lose the yacht. - Good luck. - You too. Talk! So, you're not going to tell us who you are. I know how to make you talk. I'm going to...! Spider! Fly away oh birds... Damn, it's all because of you. The yacht sailed out 10 minutes ago. I informed the headquarters. Well done. We have to be more careful now. Hands up! Stand up! Move it. Go over here! Look at that, like a demon. I bet you work out at this gym. Let's take your mask out. Turn around! Don't let the manager find out that we train at night. It's a thief. Our guys look out for the yacht. Nadja escaped us. Letters. They're taken to the gym of the karate guys. I could only get these things. I stole these from the manager. Then I must arrest you. What about you? The yacht is gone, Nadja is gone, Spider is gone. The dollars have been sent, there seems to be no problem today. - We can't overlook what happened. - To hell with them all. I do what I intend to do. No one can stop me. What happened to your eye? - I bumped into the door. - Whatever. Give me the addresses. I'll write them down immediately. Here. We'll meet tomorrow night here again. The incident today made me sick. We should finish everything and leave. That is if after we finish off... ...Captain America as well. Wait here for me. He- He- Latest news! Rich woman killed in her bathroom. - Last night's murder. - Give me one. Another Spider murder. - Anything stolen? - A very precious statuette. The maid has reported the incident. We have to act quick. We have to put the pieces of the letter together. You're right. Go to the lab and help the experts. Let's get to work right away. I'll keep an eye on the post box. It's 08:30. The lab will open in half an hour. - We'll search the yacht with Santo. - Let's go. Good bye, Julia. Bye bye, darling. Look at its beauty, Nadja. It's really beautiful, my love. Each of them is worth hundred thousands. They're worth millions. The millionaires in America will rush for them. - And then... - And then? Let the millions flow. Yes, my love. Let the millions flow. I'm sorry. Do you have a light? No news from the yacht. I'm standing watch here. Thank you. And these are the messages from these pieces. Thank you. - Are there many more left? - No, just a few more. How many letters did you bring today, courier beauty? Only 3 letters, Mr. Bilal. So, how are things? Tea, sandwiches! Tea, sandwiches! - Tea. - Right away, sir. Why don't you say yes? Don't be so stubborn. You're breaking my heart. Let's go to my place, I'll show you my collection. Don't you feel ashamed of hitting on my sister? Let's meet tomorrow night then. Don't worry. Now we're done for. What are you doing here? - Well, Mrs. Nadja... - Shut up! I had things to talk over with Ali. Go to the club. Don't let me catch you here again. - Get working. - All right. Fine. It's not here either. Let's go. - Where to? - Fenerbahne bay. All right. I'll go and talk with the watchman. Nothing new, chief. Are you alone? Hakk? stands watch at the lighthouse. Yes, sir. Please, don't. Please, you're hurting me! He was on the lookout and hid when he saw me. I came to see and they attacked me. What are you doing here? I was just keeping watch. You're very lucky, Santo. Why? You always find money since your arrival in Istanbul. Hi, Julia. Hi, darling. Here's a copy of the addresses. This belongs to the woman murdered yesterday. Then the others are in danger too. We should take precautions immediately. It's been taken. How? I called the chief from the lab and gave him the addresses. The houses are being observed now. It's good that you didn't wait for us. - Did Orhan and Santo come back? - Not yet. Wait for them. Tell Orhan when he arrives... ...Spider has a connection with the Blue Corner night club. He should go to the club and find a way to place an undercover agent. All right. Santo should wait for me. - We'll go somewhere else. - All right. I'll go see the chief. So the houses are under surveillance. Yes, boss. The houses are being watched by the police. I saw it with my own eyes. Where do you think they got the addresses from? Answer me, manager. Just the two of us knew the addresses. I really don't get it. Take that rat to the basement and tie him up. Let me go! I'm not a rat! What information did you get about the households? The woman has a maid and a driver. The other man has a wife and a 9-10 year old kid. The woman's driver comes each day at 9 o'clock to take her. Then he leaves the car at the garage in Sisli. His name is Fikret and he lives in Sisli. He's a gigolo. I took their pictures. Everything's ready, boss. I swear I didn't tell anyone the addresses. Forgive me, boss. I'm innocent. Innocent, huh? Bring it over. Poor mice. They've been starving since one week. Now I'll give them a feast. Watch and learn what happens to those that betray me. The party is over. Everybody upstairs. Hello, Ali. Pack the dollars. We're going to send them tonight. They'll be taken at 23:00 sharp. The men have been informed. - What time is it? -22:00. Whiskey, please. You have a great show. Our night club is tops. It's unique in Istanbul. Do you have the same show each night? It's obvious that you've never been here before. Our show is very rich. Mrs. Janette will appear tomorrow night. - Who? - Mrs. Janette. Who's that? You don't know shit. She's a stripper. She takes out her clothes like this. I see. That's what boss says. She'll be in Athens tonight. She'll fly over tomorrow. - Is that your boss? - He's a great lad. Our boss is a fine guy. He helps the poor. Reserve me a place for tomorrow night. Yes, sir. Your place will be ready tomorrow night. You're right on time. The money is ready. Where? They're bringing it. Exactly 3 million dollars in tens and hundreds. You're doing well here. We wanted to print 5 million dollars but the shipment has been... ...rearranged for tonight. We didn't make it. I don't understand why boss is in such a rush.. He probably has a good reason. That's right. - He's cornered. - Who are they? Look! Not so fast, Hikmet. You're hurting me. Darling. Leyla. My Leyla. Slow down. Any good news? We found the place where they make the false dollars. - Just as they came to pick it up. - So, there was a fight then. You bet. The officers are taking care of the men. - Where's Julia? - Julia? Julia flew to Athens. Athens? Why? We've informed the Greek Interpol. They'll help her take the place of the stripper to appear at Blue Corner. And I give to you Mrs. Julia! And this is her dandy host, Frank Sinatra. Gentlemen, I'll cover the costs of the club tomorrow night. The driver is here. It's 9 o'clock. He's right on time. Oya? Oya? Where are you? Oh my God. Oya! Let go off me. Let go, my love. I beg you, Hikmet! - Are you Mrs. Janette? - Yes. - Are you the actor Mr. Cemil? - No, madam. I'm Abdullah. Nice to meet you. Mr. Cemil apologized for not being able to come. He said excuse me. I understand, Mr. Abdul. Let's go to your hotel. - My luggage? - I'll take it. There it is. They were killed 2 hours ago. Hello. This is Orhan. They've been killed for the same reason. Yes, it was him. It seems that he took the place of the driver he killed. Now we'll apply the new plan. You're a genius, my love. - I'll be at the headquarters. - Yes, sir. Let's go. Hello? Yes. The mannequin shop was raided? Last night? Idiot! Why didn't you tell us before? You just found out? Go to hell. Don't tell anyone. Captain America. If only I catch you... I'll finish it tonight. They won't be expecting this... ...after the robbery today. I'm worried. Things are getting out of hand. Let's leave. We'll leave tomorrow. But tonight... Good night, Americanos. Welcome. This way, please. What would you like to order? - Two whiskeys. - Yes, sir. Mrs. Janette, you're very different from your pictures. Make up, Mr. Cemil. You should know about it. Come in. We'll fight till Julia sees it. Then we pretend to have fainted. They're coming. What are you doing, man? Stop it, hey! What's gotten into you? Stop it, you've wrecked up the place. I saw Julia. It's about time. Hello, Mr. Orhan. This is Julia. Things got out of hand at the club. Our guys have been caught. I'm calling from the manager's office. All right, I'll stay here till you arrive. Yes, that's him. I saw him at the gym on the days the addresses were stolen. Then I didn't see him again. Thanks, Meral. Your memory is good. He'll award you. Get them to clear up the mess till I'm back. Put them in the car! Clear up the place. - Who is it? - It's me, Meral. Come in. Julia, open the door. It's me, Orhan. - Gather them up. - Yes, sir. She knows where they've been taken. - Is the boss upstairs? - Yes. Sedat, take two men with you. Lock those guys in a room. I'm going upstairs. Wait for me here. Stop being stubborn. Tell us where they've gone. Otherwise you'll end up on the gallows. Move it. Hurry up. Get inside. Let's go. We'll speak for you at the court if you talk. I give you my word. Where have they gone? I'm going to tell you everything. It's all your fault! What are you looking at, you fool? - Are you talking to me? - Yes. I'm going to kill you! They're watching us. Stop it. I'm going to kill you. Open the door. Take care of them. Where's Captain America? He's after the green maniac. Oh, darling. We'll always be in touch, friends. Bon voyage. - Bon voyage. - Thank you.
