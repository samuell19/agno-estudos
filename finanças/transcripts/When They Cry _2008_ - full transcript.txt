You did it right? It wasn't me. Rika-chan? Yes? Please tell me who did it. I don't know. Rena-chan? Yes. You're on day duty today. I haven't heard the morning greetings yet. Yes. Stand. Bow. Good morning. Sit. Today I want to introduce a new transfer student to this school. I'm Maebara Keiichi. I came from Tokyo. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you! Okay. You can sit in that open seat there. Alright. I'm Sonozaki Mion. I'm the class president, nice to meet you. one month later Here. Oh, thank you. I'm off. Have a safe trip. Where's Keiichi going? Today his friends from school are showing him around the village. So that means he's completely blended in now. Before he was all like "I want to go home already." so persistently. Even though we've been worried about him that much... Like I said... You're worrying too much. Kids are really strong beings. If they become too spoiled, they lose that original flame... This is good, you made it? No, Rena-chan taught me. Rena-chan? Oh, in Keiichi's class? In this village, all the adults and children are very kind. A bit too generous. You also found the scenery you wanted the most, so draw a lot of good pictures. Where are you going? In Hinamizawa, the current population is 200,000. The winter air is thick and the convenience for transportation is bad. But, nobody ever leaves this village. Why? Because... everyone loves this village! The edible plants... mushrooms... berries. The water in Hinamizawa has the best taste in all of Japan! Being born here and dying here. That's the belief of best happiness in this village. Kei-chan? This is the demon's mouth. Demon's mouth, eh... This is pretty large. That's right. This also has a legendary circle here too. You want to come here next time? There's something extremely interesting here. That'd be great! Its dangerous here so we've been told to not play around here. You always say things like that. What's this? This is a shrine to calm the demons. A demon? A long time ago, there was a demon that was born on this village. There is a legend to this. That's why that's the demon's mouth. But... this place really feels good. Hinamizawa's spiritual guide is above here. The Furude shrine. Geez, Kei-chan you're slow! What are you doing?! You're too fast! I'm exhausted. There's a festival at this shrine next Sunday. Oh I see. It's your first time here, so you have to pray. That's right. I'll pass. I'm not interested in that sort of thing. You can't! You have to give your greetings to Oyashiro-sama. No, it's fine. I'll pass on religious things. You can't! If you don't give your greetings to Oyashiro-sama... You'll become cursed! We're saying this for your sake. Since I'm here I'll just follow your ways. I'll just do it, alright? You can't! You have to do it in order. What's with you? Kei-chan. This is how we go to meet Oyashiro-sama. Extend both arms. Cross together. Bow. We'll repeat it one more time. Put your hands in front of your chest. Bow. Clap. Bow. You got it? Yeah. You've been saying "Oyashiro-sama" a lot before, who is that person? The person who protects this village. This village has always been protected by Oyashiro-sama. Eh? Whats up with those clothes? Because Rika is the Furude shrine's maiden. Did you not know? Furude Rika... Furude shrine. Oh I see. Come this way. Hinamizawa village always thought very highly of Oyashiro-sama and followed it. You got it? This is called the Saiguden What's inside of it? Oyashiro-sama's important tools are collected inside of it. Oh? It sounds very interesting. You are to always avoid it. Is what is being said. If you randomly go and peek inside, you'll become cursed. Here. Thank you. You're so kind! My home is this way, so... Bye! Bye-bye! Mion! What is it? Thanks... for taking me around... the village. Re-chan, bye bye! Be careful! Rena, you too. Thanks. It's the first time this happened for me. It was fun. That's not true... I think everyone's really happy that you came. I'm also happy. no littering This is... This is Treasure Mountain. Treasure Mountain? People keep on throwing away garbage here. Mii-chan does it too. But, to me, it's treasure mountain, with a lot of interesting things in it. It seems that there's a lot of things gathered from other parts of the country. This is amazing... This place was... ...originally a construction site. A construction site? That's right. A dam site. By dam... you mean that dam? Hinamizawa village would have been submerged if a dam were built there. Seriously? But... The construction got halted. I'm really glad. That construction is... Tomitake-san! You surprised me. Sorry, sorry. You two look really romantic in the sunset so... Are you doing good, Rena? Yes. A face I haven't seen around here before. Is he a transfer student? Maebara Keiichi-kun. He came from Tokyo. Eh? From Tokyo? I'm surprised you came to this suburb. I'm Tomitake. Oh, that's right, Keiichi. Please wait a moment. But, aren't you scared coming to a place like this, Rena-chan? They said that there is still a missing arm, right? An arm? You don't know? There was a mutilation murder case here. Four years ago... it's said that the dam construction chief got mutilated. And they have yet to find the right arm. In Hinamizawa, when the dam construction started to build up, this village started to fight against it. Because the other side was spirited away shishidome. Spirited away shishidome? That's right. One of those who protect another even if they die. Of course, those that were in it were heavily blamed. Then... this incident is... Rena-chan, you finished looking through your treasure? Yeah. I see. Well, before the sun goes down, I'll take an extra picture. See you later. See you. I'll see you again. That person's a camera man? That's right. He takes pictures of animals and nature here. He comes by often so everyone knows of him. He's a weird man. And Rena... what's with that crude item? Make sure to not hurt him, okay? Okay. Here. Salvage complete. I'm so glad. It's not scary anymore, okay? You're no longer alone. Thank you. Rena... You know... ...about that incident around here... Is it true? -I don't know. I see. Today was fun. Yeah. Thanks to that, I know my way around this village. I'm glad that you do know. Isn't it great? 13th of June What the heck... Geez, you put too many things in there, Kei-chan. Nothing else would fit. Alright... Thank you. Thanks. Satoshi... is he someone that graduated? Hey, Mion? He transferred off. Satoshi-kun. Hey, Kei-chan. Wanna go fishing along the way back? That sounds good! Sensei. I finished with today's patient. Takano-san. You can go home now. You have a promise, right? Yes. I'm sorry. Then, I'll be going first. Hey, Mion. What is it? Rena really likes that construction garbage dump, right? Isn't it because theres a lot of weird things in that area? Weird things eh... You know... I heard there was a murder case there... Is that true? Who told this to you? This person named Tomitake-san. It was this case where this chief got mutilated... It didn't exist. Kei-chan. You shouldn't worry about some outsider's stories. I'm also an outsider, though. Oh, I got something! This is bad. This is bad! Put more spirit in it and pull it up! Keep fighting, It's probably a big one! Kei-chan, you need to work harder! I am! Dang... that was close... Damn... it must be big considering how much we pulled. Hey, Mion... Miyo-san. Good Afternoon. Oh, are you the rumored transfer student? Yes. That's right. Oh, Miyo-san. She's the nurse at the clinic. Nice to meet you. I'm Takano Miyo. Hello. So, have you gotten used to the village? Well... somewhat... I see, I'm glad. The other day your father came in, he's an artist, right? He asked me to model for his art. Oh, I see. My dad is very shameless. Miyo-san, what are you doing here? Taking a walk. I really like this area. This is the starting point of the demon's mouth, right? So then, next time, Keiichi-kun should come to the clinic. Okay. I'll go. She's really pretty, right? What's wrong? Hinamizawa dam construction area 19th of june Welcome, welcome! This is good right? It's good! There's an onage. An onage ? In the case that you don't get anything... Yeah? You'll be punished by having things written all over you! Yay! Yay! Alright! Kei-chan... That's an amazing face! Oh you're here. Tomitake-san caught me! Yo, Keiichi. Yo, Satoko! Keiichi, thanks for before. What's up with that face? Shut up. So, here I go. Hey, Keiichi-kun, smile! Here I go. One plus one is... Two! What's up with that look? What's up with that look? Rika-chan... is amazing! This is done before the speech of Oyashiro-sama. Oyashiro-sama lived with the village for a long time while calming the demons out. And from then, it always protected the village. Giving all of their hidden thanks during winter, people take their hands out and wash it. That's the Watanagashi ritual. I see. Hey... I want to go to the restroom... Where is it? What are you saying? Oyashiro-sama will get angry! Geez. It can't be helped, right? Keiichi-kun, the restroom is by saiguden. Thank you. Geez, the water reeks. What's this? This is wonderful... It's exactly as it was written... Jiro-san, quickly take the pictures. Yeah. But is it alright? I feel like we'll seriously get punished. This is amazing... In the past, they used this... Keiichi-kun. Do you know about the Watanagashi ritual's history? History? I don't know. A human... Human? In the past, it cut humans to many parts. Using the tools in this room. In Hinamizawa... The village has a demon in it... That name is just like it says... Someone mixed with the demon's blood. With that... Without compressing the blood... Once a year... It kills a human and eats it. Cutting apart the dead person... From then, it ate everything. That ritual is watanagashi's origin. Four years ago, the dam construction chief got murdered. You know of that, right? That was the beginning of it all. The beginning? The following year, another incident occured. There was a report of a husband falling from a cliff. His wife's whereabouts are unknown. The couple is Satoko-chan's parents. Satoko? Again, the next year, the Furude shrine's priest suddenly died without knowing the cause. Afterwards, the wife drowned herself. By Furude shrine... Rika-chan's... And last year... There was a wife that got beaten to death by a man. And then the man's whereabouts are also unknown. That is Satoko-chan's brother. His name is Satoshi-kun. Satoshi... is he someone that graduated? Oyashiro-sama's curse... That's what everyone in the village says. Because the incidents always revolve around the dam construction's workers or people who were with making the dam. Everyone thinks as those who wants to make the dam to submerge the village as traitors. This peaceful looking village actually does a vicious ritual. And maybe... they may not realize it themselves. Takano-san has been researching about all the incidents. Every year the incident occurs on the night of the Watanagashi festival. Keiichi-kun. Do you think of this as a coincidence? Then that means... The village is doing something weird. There's no doubt that there's going to be a sacrifice tonight as well. Who exactly... would it be? In other words... It'd be sometime tonight... Keiichi-kun. Tonight... What the, you were here, Keiichi-kun. Where in the mountains did you go to the restroom? It's bad to interupt Miyo-san's date! From here on we're going to the Watanagashi. You two take your time. Let's go! Keiichi-kun! Let's slowly talk about things again. See ya! Bye-bye! Let's go! 20th of June Sorry to keep you waiting. Here is Maebara Keiichi-kun. Oh hello. I'm Oishi from the Okinomiya police station. Maeyara-san. It's Maebara. Oh, sorry. Maebara-san. You were with Tomitake yesterday, right? Yes. Oh... About Tomitake-san... To tell you the truth, he died. Around this area- his throat precisely. He kept on ripping on it... And died. That... why? I wonder why. And also, he was with Takano Miyo-san last night sneaking into the shrine, right? Yes. Takano Miyo-san went missing since last night. Let's slowly talk about things again. Kei-chan. What did you talk to Chie sensei about? She suddenly called you out... Umm... it's nothing important. Well... thank you for answering the questions. And also, I would like you to not talk about this to anyone else, especially not with your friends. Why? This incident may not be known with the village. In the worst case, the villagers may be the ones that did it. That's in the worst case. What do you mean by that? There were two that snuck in last night. That rumor went around, right? That's why those two were cursed by Oyashiro-sama. And it's pretty angry. Maebara-san, have you heard about Houjou Satoshi from your class? No, I haven't really heard anything. Last year at Watanagashi festival, Satoshi-kun suddenly disappeared and nobody knows his death. You're leaving already? Yeah... my body feels a little weird. It may be a cold. I see. Keiichi-kun! Keiichi-kun! What's wrong? Here. If you get wet you'll catch a cold. What were you talking about at lunch, Keiichi-kun? Nothing important. It's something that's not concerning you guys. We're your friends. So, you can trust us and tell us anything. Satoshi-kun... Where did he go? Why do you ask that? It's fine. You can't tell me about it anyways, right? You said you didn't know about the incidents at the dam, right? But it actually happened. You couldn't tell me that? I never thought of it like th- -You did! You hide everything to me! In spite of that... Don't say I'm friends with you! So... how about Keiichi-kun? Keiichi-kun, are you hiding things from everyone? Keiichi-kun, who did you talk to before? Like I said, Chie sensei You're lying! (writing says liar) Keiichi-kun, you also have things that you hide from others. Rena... The person you talked to was Oishi-san, right? The police... What the hell's up with that look of yours?! You have a problem with it, Maebara? Don't look at us like that. Why did you do nothing, Maebara? Why are you silent? Are you mocking me, Maebara? What are you thinking about? I can never... know now... Keiichi... What do you mean by quitting school? Oyashiro-sama always protected this village. What did you talk to Chie sensei about? You're lying! Keiichi! It's a call from a store in Okinomiya. Oishi, I'll be going first. Oh Maebara-san. Sorry for calling your home. I didn't want to worry your other family members so I faked it out as a bookstore. What do you want? Maebara-san. I want you to cooperate with me. Cooperate? With what? I couldn't say this at school, but... the first thing... Be careful of Sonozaki Mion-san. Mion? That's right. Mion-san's family was the one who lead the strike against the dam construction four years ago. And the second one is to be careful of Ryuugu Rena-san's movements. Rena? Ryuugu Rena's parents moved away and now she lives with her father. To tell you the truth, she left Hinamizawa and suddenly came back last year. And she caused an incident at her other school. Run for it! It's hot... Oyashiro-sama! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Oyashiro-sama! It seems that she kept on repeating "Oyashiro-sama" at the clinic. Also saying something about Oyashiro-sama always looking at her... Are you saying that Rena and Mion are involved in this case? No, umm... If I say it this way, you would understand... Even if they are young, you have to keep watch on them. Are you telling me to spy on them? It'll be troubling if you said it as spying. I just want you to be careful of them. That's all it is. And also- Did Rena-chan go home? Rena? What are you saying? Rena-chan came in and went up. Were you not awake? Rena-chan looked very worried, since you weren't looking well today. Did something happen at school? 21st of june This is good! Docter's office It seems like your fatigue is piled up. Maebara-san. Before the festival, you said you went to a funeral in Tokyo, right? Yes. A relative of mine. Just because you got into a new environment, there is a large chance of your well being to go down a little bit. That incident might now be effecting you. I see... Is Takano-san safe? You were with her that night of the festival, right? Do you know of anything? No. I... don't have a clue. I see. Maebara-san. There is something that may occur, but... It has a very small chance... If there is some sudden change in your condition, please contact me immediately. Okay. Okinomiya station I see. And, how is it? I'm okay. I just caught a little cold. I see. I'll tell you the bad news first. Right now we're looking for the proof but we believe that corpse belongs to Takano Miyo-san. You're looking a little pale, Maebara-san. Are you alright? Is it the curse? Everyone got killed by Oyashiro-sama's curse, right? Tomitake-san had many extra bruises on his arm for some reason. It's probably because of someone being around... For example, he could have been drugged. Before his death he kept on ripping at his neck. And continued to die. Do you think there is such a god that does that? Then who did it? If they really did go into the building that night... It's something that should never happen according to the village. And there... The two of them went in anyways. Tomitake and Takano-san can probably never be forgiven. And I also heard of another rumor. There was another person that snuck into the building that night with Tomitake-san and Takano-san. Maebara-san, do you know anything about that last person? No. I don't know anything. Excuse me. Now... Let's order our food. I... lost an important friend on the incidents. Please trust me and tell me the truth, Maebara-san. Before Oyashiro-sama's curse comes again. Hinamizawa Bus stop I'm back. A we're away for a while, take care while we're gone note What, you look just fine. I worried about you. Is your cold fine? Hey, where did you mom and dad go? We saw them both go somewhere before. Here. Our gift to you. My grandmother's special ohagi. And, I made one of them. Now here's the problem: Try to guess which one Rena made! If you get it right, we'll give you a present! T-Thanks. I was getting hungry right now. Keiichi-kun, where did you go while sick? At the Okinomiya restaurant, she saw someone looking like you talking to some man there. That's not true, right? Yeah, I... Huh? You're a little pale. Now, let's go home. Yeah. Keiichi-kun, get well soon. Come to school tomorrow, okay? Yeah, alright. See you. Tell me which one I made tomorrow, okay? If you get it wrong, there's punishment waiting! Alright... Which one is the one that Rena made? It's easy, this one! 22th of June Satoshi Satoshi... How much did you know? Satoshi-kun... Started to swing the bat like that. Just like in your situation. And... Satoshi-kun stopped talking with people... I see. Satoshi was the same as I. Just like him... The same... By you guys... I see. Satoshi-kun was loved by everyone. Even then... Satoshi-kun suddenly started to doubt us... And transferred off, right? But that's a lie, right? He didn't transfer at all. Satoshi suddenly disappeared after the Watanagashi. He's just killed somewhere and they can't find his corpse. And he was by some Oyashiro person. Please don't say things like that! Satoshi-kun... did not die- Stop messing around! I know! Being cursed and all... Killing off people that distrust you. Everyone in this village is screwed up! Yes we're screwed up. The people in this village are screwed up by Oyashiro-sama's curse. Every year on the night of Watanagashi... they created a rule that we can kill anyone that doesn't like the village. And it repeats every year. And... Satoshi-kun was under that rule. Why?! Why?! Satoshi-kun didn't do anything wrong! He's different from you! What did I do wrong? You did what wrong? Everyone knows that you snuck into the shrine on that night. If you do something like that, it's natural that you get killed. You didn't do anything wrong? Don't make me laugh! It's natural that you get killed. You can just become his bait! No matter how much you struggle... He'll kill you no matter what. Are you... Really... Mion? You can just become Oyashiro-sama's sacrifice! Hello? This is mom. Are you okay? We're doing many... We can't go home today... I'm... sorry... Be sure to eat dinner. Ah, this is Oishi. I'd be happy if you called back. What do you mean by that? Anyways, it's been deducted that Takano Miyo-san's death was caused a long time before Watanagashi's festive. Well... we don't know what's going on... So Maebara-san, what I'm saying is... This means that she's been dead before you've even met her on that night. That's... Maebara-san, may I meet up with you? Right away if possible. What's this... Exactly what's going on? Did you know which ohagi was mine? A? B? C? Which one is it? I wonder? Keiichi-kun? Why aren't you opening up? Keiichi-kun? Keiichi-kun? Open up! Keiichi-kun? Please! Open up! I'm begging you, open it! Keiichi-kun! I'm begging you! Keiichi-kun! I'm begging you, open it! Please... Keiichi-kun... What's wrong? I wonder? Let go... Stop... Keiichi-kun... your mom isn't there, right? So let's eat dinner together! Stop! Stop... It hurts! Keiichi-kun! Stop... Open it! Leave here! Don't come here again! You got it?! I got it... I got it so please open it... This is... the end, right? Why did it become like this? Where did it go wrong? You finally woke up. I'm glad. Rena? Keiichi-kun? You were having a high fever so I was worried. Oh, you're finally awake. I'm glad. You guys... Exactly... what was... Keiichi-kun, you seemed like you were having a nightmare and stayed in it. We have to wash your body since you sweated a ton. Yeah. Keiichi-kun, raise your arms. It was a dream... What the heck... What? Keiichi-kun, what kind of nightmare were you having, I wonder? Yeah... Hey Mion, it's tickling there. But it's dirty! Geez. But really, that was such a nightmare... I already... What's wrong? I wonder what's wrong... I wonder? Hey, Kei-chan. Where did your mom and dad go? It's weird that they didn't come back, right? Don't tell me... you guys... What... do you mean? What's that? Don't push yourself. Didn't the doctor at the clinic say so, Keiichi-kun? Kei-chan, did you forget about the ohagi problem? If you're wrong... I told you about the punishment right? That was a dream...? That was the worst... That was way too cruel, Oishi-san. Yeah. I agree. Keiichi-kun's whereabouts are... I see. Oishi-san, I want to get him as soon as possible. Yeah. I know. Yes, Okinomiya office. Maebara-san. Maebara-san! Maebara-san, right? Where are you, Maebara-san! Oyashira-sama... there... What'd you say? What about Oyashiro-sama, Maebara-san? Maebara-san, what's wrong?! Behin...d... Oyashiro-sama... is here... Oyashiro-sama... is here... Maebara-san, what are you doing? Maebara-san, are you... Maebara-san! Where are you? Where are you? Oyashiro-sama... Maebara-san! Maebara-san! Maebara-san! I see... I finally... understand... Oyashiro-sama... I'm sorry... Maebara-san! Maebara-san! It's an emergency. Let me use your car. You idiot! I'm telling you it's an emergency! Maebara-san! Maebara! These findings for this incident concerning Hinamizawa village's female murders. In the first place... The suspect Maebara Keiichi is... Is the classmate of Sonozaki Mion and Ryuugu Rena. There is no evidence at all of the reason. But during that time, we found what seems to be a memo written by the victim in Maebara's home. The memo was written in two separate things, and was put behind the clock. On one of them is a short memo written by Mion. But, on the memo... This was found. In other words, someone may have used it before we got to the room. And the other memo is thought of as the motive, written as the truth... I will read exactly what is written: "I, Maebara Keiichi, am being targetted." What's wrong? Wow it's beautiful. It really is!
