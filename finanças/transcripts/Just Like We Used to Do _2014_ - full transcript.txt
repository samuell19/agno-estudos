- All right, Cameron. You're gonna have tables one through five tonight, so just do the best you can. Kitchen staff, wash, rinse and sanitize. I cannot stress that enough. Cleanliness and good customer service is top priority here at this restaurant. Really? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I know. - Anyway, as I was saying. We're booked solid tonight, so I really need US To just to ah, just Coop-- - just answer it already. - Hello? Yeah, I told you guys not to call me unless it was an emergency. I need you guys to cooperate with me. - Damn it, all right. I'll be right there. I'm really sorry. - One more time and you're outta here! - I was a change of life baby. They said I was a miracle. Jesus Christ. I could really use a miracle right now. Garbage. Just horrible. Mom! Mom! Where are you going? - I'm going to meet Johnny. - You can't, mom. Come on. - Why not? - Because he's not gonna be there. - But he told me to meet him after school. - You're not in school anymore. You understand? - Doozer? - Yeah, mom. - What are you doing here on the side of the road? - Oh, I don't know, mom. I thought I'd go for a walk. Come on. - Oh, it is a nice day for a walk. Come on. - I'm coming. - Have you been smoking? - No! - Smoking isn't good for you. - I know! - How's your day? - It sucks. - Oh, don't use that word. It's not ladylike. - It does. - Do you need money? - No, don't need money. - Well, then what's wrong? - Nothing. - Let's see. Want it? It was your father's favorite. Have a little piece. Mmm. I'm gonna save it. - Okay. - Ah. - Ready to go? - Yeah, I think so. I'll drive. - You remember how? - Uh. No. - Then no, I'm sorry. Okay? Come on. Just go in there. - Garbage. Hi there, Sophie. Welcome back. - Where's Jerry? - He's in the back office. - Yeah, that's great. Go get him. - I'm really sorry about-- - I don't really care. Go get him now! Thank you. What the hell are you doing with my mother, Jerry? - Before you start yelling, it wasn't-- - it wasn't what? You're about to tell me that it wasn't your fault that my 73-year-old mother just had a prison break. - She got the ankle monitor off. What do you expect US to do? - Keep her away from sharp objects, Jerry. - We do. She's wily. - She's wi? I'm sorry, are you talking about my 73-year-old mother with dementia or a coyote? Huh? Which one? Jerry, this is the second time this month. I just don't know what to do anymore. - Coffee? So where'd you find her? - Same place as before. Where's that? - This farmhouse on pulce road. It's where my dad used to live. - Most people like your mom, they live in another decade. - My mom isn't like most people, Jerry, if you haven't noticed. So how are you feelin'? - Fine. - You're fine? - Yeah, I'm fine. Why? What the hell is that? - It's a therapist we work with. - What the fu-- - we all thought-- - who's we? - All of US that work here. We all thought you could use someone to talk to. - Oh, you did. So that's what you do here, huh? You sit there and you drink coffee and you gossip while your patients make a getaway! God damn it, Jerry. - First of all, this is an assisted living home. It's not a hospital. You're mom's not a patient. And secondly, we understand that, you know, this is very hard for you. - Oh, you understand? You understand which part? Huh, Jerry? - A young woman like yourself shouldn't have to bear this kind of a burden. And I can see it's taking a toll on you. - My mother is not a burden, Jerry. - I didn't mean it like that. - Where are your parents, Jerry? - They both passed away. - I'm really, really sorry to hear that. But I do still have one parent left. And I'm gonna take care of her. What's left of her. - Most people couldn't do what you do. Not even people my age. - Yeah, well maybe that's why I do it. I have more energy than you do. - I want a cat. - Yeah, that's not a good idea, mom. It's a wonderful idea. - You know what's not a wonderful idea? Walking out of here like that. Did you hear me? You can't walk out of here like that, mom. It's not safe. - I'm perfectly safe. - In here. In here you're perfectly safe, but you can lost or you can get hurt outside. I can get lost or hurt anywhere. - Mom, would you just, mom just please. - We're done. You are so sweet and so beautiful. - I know, I take after you, mom. - Aw, I wish you'd find a boyfriend. Oh my god. - Whatever happened to what's his name? - Who? Oh, tall, dark hair. - Jason. - Jason, yes. Yeah. - What happened to him? - That was in high school, mom. He went away to college and I stayed here. - Oh, you'll find somebody. Johnny always said you can catch more flies with honey. - And you're full of honey. Yes, I know, I know. - Oh, I have to go meet olive. We're playing bridge. Come on. - Okay. Oh come on, man. Not you too.

We gotta go to the doctor. - I've been waiting here since lunch. - Since lunch, yeah? - Mmm-hmm. - Mom, it's nine o'clock in the morning, come on. - Uh. Ready to go? Did you eat breakfast? - Yes. I hate this stuff. I want to go home. Will you take me home? I hate it here. - Mom, you don't hate it here. You love it here. - No, no, I don't. I want to go home with John. I don't like the people here. - Mom, don't you remember you telling me the other day how much you love it here, how much you love making these necklaces and watching movies and the food? - Oh. - Come on, you love the food. - The food is delicious. - Yeah. - Do you know they give you dessert here? - Do they? - I always get the blueberry pie. They put ice cream on it and everything. - See, that sounds good. - Ah, it's the best I ever had. - Come on, seriously, you do love it here. Yeah? You ready? Ready to go? - Where? - Mom, your checkup. Come on, mom. Let's go. - Why do I have to go there? - It's a checkup, let's go. Come on. It's a checkup. Ready? - Okay. It's a good thing you came then. Otherwise I'd have to drive myself. Really? All right, you ready? - Oh, I need my jacket. Where is it? I'll get it. - I'm not sure. - Okay, I'll check in your room. Hey, Roger. Spit in your eye! - Very nice. How are you doin' today? - What can you do? Do-do-do. - I feel the same way. - I used to make sweaters, but I'd crochet them. - Oh, I knit. I love to knit. - I'd make beautiful pink sweaters. I once even made a dress. - Oh, I don't like wearing dresses. - I once wore this dress to a dance with my high school sweetheart. - Oh, I graduated from high school in 1950-- - Ha ha! That was fantastic! Thank you for making my day. All right, I gotta go now. - Bye bye! - Bye! I'll see you later. Spit in your eye! - I agree. Have a good day. - Oh, I had blue curtains in my bathroom. - That's nice. - Very nice. Blue is my favorite color. Come on, mom. You ready to go? - She's so pretty. You are beautiful, my little girl. Yeah, wait, come on. You got it? Not so little anymore, mom. Let's go. Okay, okay. All right. - Bye, olive. Let's go. - Say hi for me. - Looks like you have fun with Rose. By the way, mom, her name is Rose, not olive. - She's a real bitch. Hi, I'm Sophie. I know. Have a seat, Sophie. - Well now you see, I don't have an appointment. I was wondering if you could get me one to see the doctor. I want to get him to fix my teeth. - You have an appointment. Just have a seat and the doctor will be right with you. - I didn't know we had an appointment. It's a good thing we came. - I know. Don't you remember that you called me like three times last night? You said you wrote it down. Did you write it down? - Do you think the doctor could fix my teeth? - There's nothing wrong with your teeth. - Well, yes. Look! They are all black. - They're not black, they're fine. - They feel black. Hello again, Sophie. Hi, doc. - Isadora. How's everything going? - I like your outfit. - Well, thank you. I like your necklace, too. - I made it. Would you like one? I can make one for you. - That's okay. It's lovely, but I don't need one. - Oh, I have an itch. I had one of my breasts removed. I had cancer. I know. - You do? Oh, well, I don't wear bras anymore. I don't have to. - That's okay, Sophie. There's a few questions I'd like you to answer for me. - Okay. - Where do you live? What home? - Um. Uh. Is it mercy? - No. - Longwood? - What is the name? Oh, where is it? Um. What's the name? - Suncrest. - Suncrest, that's it. That's the one. - Sophie, who is the president? - Um, I never can remember that. Last one. What year is it? - 19... - The mri did show that there's a tumor. It's benign, but we won't remove it because of her condition. How has she been lately? - How are you, mom? - What, honey? - I don't know, she's been having weird conversations with me lately, like she's a teenager or something. - It's not unusual in Alzheimer's to regress to a happier time. For Sophie, that might be high school. - Okay, that would explain the pom poms. Pom poms? - Mom, where are your pom poms? - Oh. - She wants to go home. She's been asking more and more lately. - Must be tough. Yeah, i'm running out of excuses. - Well, why don't you take her home? On short trips? - Okay. Wherever she wants to go, just for a couple of hours. It might take the sting out of having these conversations over again. - Okay. How are you doing? - Why does everyone keep asking me that? Do I seem unbalanced this week? Not at all. - Then why do people keep asking me? Because it's difficult. - Yes, it is difficult. You know, it would help to talk to someone. - I have had this in my pocket for over a week now. What is it? - A therapist. Are you gonna use it? - Mmm-mmm. - Doozer, are you finished? - Yes, mom. Doc, always a pleasure. - See you next month, Isadora. And let me recommend that you use that number. - Why don't you recommend me some Vicodin. - Nice try. You should smile more often. It's good for your health. - I would if it didn't hurt my face so much, doc. - Take care. - You too. Hi. - Hi. - I'm Michael. - With the decaf girlfriend. - Mmm-hmm. Oh, she's not my girlfriend anymore. - Couldn't handle the differing opinions on caffeine? - I guess not. So you're Isadora. - Yeah, yeah. - Well, what brings you here? - Someone gave me your card. - Do you mind if I ask who gave you the card? - Just some guy that works at some place. - Okay. Do you want to be here? - Some people apparently think I need to be. - Do you? - I don't know. Isn't that your job to tell me what's wrong with me? - If you want me to. - Sure, let's take a crack at it. - Okay, well, let's start with whom you've lost. - I'm sorry? In your life. Who passed away recently? - Yeah, no, I heard you. I just, I'm a little confused about the question. - Well, that's why you're here, correct? - No. - But I'm a grief counselor. - You're a grief counselor? Mmm-hmm. - Oh. Oh, wow, that son of a bitch. Um. - I'm sorry? - It's not you. Ah, this isn't for me. I really appreciate everything. - Well, well wait. - Thanks for whatever. Well, no, wait just a minute. - This is nice. - Mmm-hmm. - I wish your father were here. - I know, me too. - How's work? - It's fine. - He would be very proud of you. Johnny would be very proud of you. Why? - Well, you're taking care of the house, of me. You're doing a good job, doozer. - It's not a job, mom. All right, you done with your water? Ready to go back? - No, I have to go to the store. - Oh, now you wanna go to, all of a sudden now you want to go to the store? - Mmm-hmm. - For what? - Cookies. - Cookies? Suncrest has cookies. I'm not goin' to the store for cookies. - Not the kind I like. - What kind is that? - The ones with the coconut on top. - Oh, the coconut on top? I don't wanna go to the store. - Aw. - Mom. Are these the cookies that you wanted? Mom, where? Where is she going? - Oh, doozer, come here. I want you to meet someone. Michael, this is my daughter Isadora. - Oh my god, I'm living in the fifth dimension. Say hello. - Hello. - Michael and I were just having a lovely chat. - Were you? - Michael, didn't I tell you? I told you she was beautiful. - Yes, she is. - Michael is a doctor. - Not really. - Well, I don't do surgery, but I have my doctorate. - Yeah, he's not a doctor. - So, what are you doing Friday night? - I don't have any plans. - Great! Then you can take Isadora out! - Mom, I don't want to do that. - Yeah, I guess I could. - Fantastic! - What are you doing? Come on, you're gonna be late for dinner. - But, but! Michael, we'll be waiting to hear from you. - Yes, of course. It was nice meeting you, Sophie. And you too, Isadora. - Hello? Hi, it's Michael. - I'm sorry, who? - You know, decaf, therapist, grocery store. - Oh yeah, right, right, right, right. Wait, I'm sorry. How did you get my number? Oh, well, your information's in our filing system. - Isn't that against the law? - Maybe. Okay, can I help you with something? - Wow, are you always this to the point? - Maybe. - Your mother so convincingly painted a portrait of her beautiful and kind daughter, that I thought I'd take her out. Okay, ah, listen. You are not the first strange man that my mother has tried to set me up with, okay? - Well there's a difference. I'm not a strange man. - You just pulled my personal information from your patient's file. I really think that qualifies as strange. - Well, I think we should humor your mother. She'll forget about it tomorrow. Trust me. - So we should go out tonight? No. - Really? Just like that? - Yes. - Wow. I don't think I've ever been turned down that quickly. - Look, I don't know you, okay? - Well, that's why people go out, to get to know one another. Listen, I'll pick you up. I'll take you out. I'll drop you off. And if you don't like me, then you'll never hear from me again. Come on, your mother says you never go out. - Don't believe everything my mother says, okay? Who, by the way, is on a very large series of medications. - So I'll pick you up tomorrow at seven? 7:30? 7:45? Is it eight o'clock? Is eight o'clock better? - All right, all right. Seven, seven. Seven. - All right, seven it is. I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good night, Isadora. - Wow. - Sophie. Where are you going? Out. - Oh, maybe tomorrow, but not right now. - But Isadora's supposed to pick me up. - Oh, not tonight, Sophie. - Looks like rain anyway. Yes, it does. I think so. - You're gonna go. You're gonna go, you're gonna go, you're gonna go. Be like a person who goes out. I'll be. Has a life. Has a life. Hi. - Hi. Hello. - Wow, you look, you look nice. - Thank you. You're very prompt. - Yeah, and are you impressed? - Not really. - Well, ah, we still have the rest of the night. - Okay, okay. Shall we? - Thank you. Serious? - Just give it a chance. It's fun. - So you're a professional bowler and a grief counselor. - No, no, no, I am an amateur bowler. - Amateur bowler. So this is just a hobby. - Yeah. Yeah, I like it. I don't usually run into many patients here. - What do you mean? Sad people don't bowl? - Guess not. - Okay. ♪ And always shines through ♪ ♪ we'll live our lives ♪ ♪ just like we used to do ♪ - All right, here we go. - That was good. - You're up!

Anything but dora's fine. - Like the explorer? Yeah, you're up. - These are the best hot dogs you will ever eat in your entire life. They may not look like much, but wait. You're not a vegetarian, are you? - Well, that would suck after buying all those hot dogs. - No, I would eat every single one of these. I have no problem with that. - Okay. Wow. Mmm, you really know how to impress a girl. - Mmm-hmm. Good, right? - Mmm-hmm. You're different than I thought you'd be. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I just thought you'd be like, more serious. - And now? - I think you're fun. - I'm fun? That's good. Fun's a good thing. - Yeah. - Do you not have much fun? - I have fun. Sometimes. - Do you mind if I ask you what the deal is with your mom? - Um, no. She had me when she was 46. - Ooh, surprise. - Big surprise. So I didn't grow up like most of the other kids. My parents are literally old-school. - How often do you see her? - Every day. - Wow. I see my mom, like, a few times a year. - That's too bad. - And why the nursing home? - Um, she was always forgetful. She'd forget her keys, her purse, her wallet, things like that. And a few years ago we just noticed that she was getting worse and then she was diagnosed with mixed dementia. - I've heard of that. That's like, she suffers from little mini strokes, right? Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. - How's your dad handled everything? - He passed away about a year ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's okay. You know, she took it really hard, but some times I think the dementia helps, you know? Because she can go off to some happy place and then she doesn't have to worry about being in that shithole that smells like old people. So it's okay sometimes. - It's all gotta be pretty hard on you. - It's like quicksand. - What do you mean? - Quicksand. It's like the earth is literally opening and about to swallow me whole and I can do nothing about it, but. - Well, if there's anything I can do to help. - These hot dogs are a good start. - So, ah, did you have a good time tonight? - Yeah, actually, I really did. Yeah. I was quite dazzled by your bowling skills. - Oh, wow. Almost sounds like you like me. - Yeah, no, not really. No. Why, do you like me? - Not really. So can I take you out again? - Can I pick the place? - Sure. What do you have in mind? - Um. Bookstore. - She was too fond of books, and it turned her brain. - You read Louisa may alcott? - No, I saw it on jeopardy. - I'm like, okay. Thank you. Of course. So can I call you tomorrow? Mmm-hmm. - Okay. Goodnight. - What happened to that boy from the grocery store? - Who, Michael? The one you forced to take me out? - Yes, Michael. Did you go out with him? - Yes. - So how was it? - It was good. I like him. - Oh, I'm so happy for you. You deserve someone nice. - We are not getting married or anything, mom. - You might. Your father proposed to me after three dates. - You were 17! - Oh, what day is it today? - Saturday. - Oh no! - What? - I forgot to pick up a birthday card. It's my sister's birthday tomorrow. - Mom, she's dead. - Dead? - Yeah, don't you remember? - I forgot. - It's okay. You wanna go look? - Mmm-hmm. - Okay, come on. - Oh, doozer, look! It's queen nefertiti! - Yes, it is. - Oh, I have to have her. - It's ugly, mom. - Oh, she's perfect. How much? $8. - $8? - Yeah, it's an antique. You can put liquor in it. - Is there liquor in it now? No. - Then four. Eight. - Five. 6.50. It's the lowest I'll go for the queen. - You got a deal. Doozer? - Yes? What do you want? - Money! - You got change? For a 20? No. - Thief. Where are you gonna put this ugly piece of crap? - Aw, don't use that word.

What, I swear to god, Allison. I walked in there, I thought I was being punked. It's not a joke. - Come on, you had fun. Wait, we had fun. It was a good time. - We had fun. We had fun. Apparently we had fun. So. Now how did the two of you meet? - We met at the supermarket. - I've known David for 15 years. We met at school. - Ah, this is true. - And you're a therapist. - Yes, yes I am. - Another one. - Well, I'm not a grief counselor like our friend over here. Specialize in addiction. - Addiction, even better. Yeah, so. Cheers to that. Cheers. - Mmm. - So. - Yes? - Michael tells me you're into books. - Yes, yes, I do love books. I do. - We have a pretty big library. Would you like to check it out? - Right now? Yes. - Yeah, of course I would. All right, let's do it. - Okay, sure. All right, can I take that? - Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. No problem. - She's a keeper. - Oh my god. - I'll be right back. Thank you. - Have fun. She's cute. Oh god. - And young. - How did I know that was coming? - I didn't say anything that you already didn't know. - 26 is not that young. - She was a patient, Michael. - Not really. I mean, she came in for-- - five minutes or five years. It's still the same. She came into your office looking for help. I mean, think about it. - Why do you always have to bring these things up? - If I think that you are going to get hurt, I'm your sister, it's my job. - I appreciate the concern, honestly, but we're-- - Allison, your collection is amazing, honestly. - Thanks. I actually haven't read. - Seriously. - Most of those. - You haven't? You are missin' out. - What'd you get? - Excellent. Well, my library is your library. - Really? Mmm-hmm. - Really? - Absolutely. Just have those back by Tuesday. - Well, where do I sign them out then? Thank you. - Don't let her fool ya. She's completely serious. You know, we should do this again. Next week? - Yeah. - Sure. - Sounds good to me. Absolutely. - Hey, to next week. Hey. - Hi. - I haven't seen you in a couple weeks. - Ah, sorry, I've been busy. - You're always busy. - Okay. - You didn't answer any of my texts. - Which one? - Any of 'em. All of 'em. - Mmm, sorry. - Well, can I take you out tomorrow? - Uh, I have plans tomorrow. - You always have plans. - Okay. I don't know what that's supposed to mean. - What is going on here? - With what? - With you and me. - I'm sorry. I wasn't aware that there was a you and me. - Come on, Isadora. You know I like you. - Uh, okay. - What are you doing that's so important tomorrow? - I'm going to see my mother. - That's always your excuse. - I'm sorry, my mother's sick. - Well, she'll get better. - Oh, she'll get better? - Yes. - Okay. Even if, don't touch me! Even if my mother wasn't sick, I still wouldn't go out with you. Okay? Do you understand? Never. Hi. Oh, there you are. I've been waiting all morning! - I'm sorry. Let's go. - Okay, you ready? Uh, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, sure. Just give me one minute, mom, okay? - Uh-- - just one minute. What's up? - Uh, we've been noticing a difference in Sophie. - Okay. What? Like her memory getting worse? - No, no, her mood. In the past two or three weeks, she's become more and more depressed, angry. - Angry? Angry. - Okay. Have you noticed? - Come on, Isadora! Let's go! - Okay, just one minute, mom. - I mean, I guess. I'm not really sure 'cause I haven't been spending as much time with her, so I'm not positive, but. - Well, let me know what you think. If necessary you may wish to arrange an appointment to change her meds. - Meds, okay. Or she may require a more restrictive setting.

Are we there yet? - Yeah, sure, I'll just pull over and we can camp out on the side of the road. Are you hungry? - Yes, a little bit. - I actually made some sandwiches. They're in the back if you want. - Oh, you did? - Yes, I did. - Peanut butter and jelly, huh?

What happened? - My mom had a bad spell. - And? - If we don't go back, they're gonna shoot her up with some drugs and I don't want that. That's good. Let them handle it. - What? Come on, Michael. - That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to take care of your mom, iz. We have to go back! She needs me, Michael! - She doesn't need you. She needs professional help. Stop the car, Michael. She's going to be fine. Stop the car! - What are you going to do? - Go see my mother! - Yeah, but I mean when you get there. What's your plan to help? - I don't know! I just want to calm her down and be with her! This is not healthy behavior, iz. - Don't do that. - You need to start letting go now. - Don't be a therapist! - Well, I'm sorry, but I am a therapist. - Not mine! - Well, I'm your boyfriend, so. - Oh! Really? Really? Good answer. That helps! There is nothing you can do. - You don't know that! - You're not a doctor or a nurse, iz! - I am her daughter, Michael! - Where are you going? - Home! - This is not healthy for you or for her. - Why are you? My god, you don't know anything about me! - I don't know anything about you? - 'Cause you think you have some fancy degree you think you know what goes on inside my head, Michael? - Listen, I know that you're scared. - Don't, stop! - I know you're sad, I know you're angry, I know you're hanging on with every fiber of your being to the last living person in your life. But you have to accept the fact she's gone! Her mind is gone, iz! She's not going to get any better! - Don't patronize me, Michael. Don't talk about me. And don't talk about my mother, okay? And don't talk about US. - US? Yeah, US. You and me, we're done. - Where are you going? - Doozer? Doozer? - Mom. - Why are you crying? Come here.

With Johnny. Okay. - I love you, my darling. Pretty little doozer. - I love you too, mom. - Now stop. I love you, too. - Now stop. I was a change of life baby. They said I was a miracle. I used to stay home with my parents watching old black and white movies. Mom sipped her iced tea with dad's arm around her shoulders, occasionally glancing at one another like I wouldn't notice. It was my favorite thing to do. To watch my parents fall in love all over again. I was a change of life baby, but they were the miracle. ♪ Forget ♪ ♪ about ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ forget about today ♪ ♪ it will go away ♪ ♪ Forget ♪ ♪ about ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ Tomorrow is another day ♪ ♪ and the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again, my friend ♪ ♪ is the rain ♪ ♪ all that bad ♪ ♪ and you never know ♪ ♪ what tomorrow will bring ♪ ♪ and the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ Forget ♪ ♪ about ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ forget about today ♪ ♪ it will go away ♪ ♪ forget ♪ ♪ about ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ tomorrow is another day ♪ ♪ and the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again, my friend ♪ ♪ is the rain ♪ ♪ all that bad ♪ ♪ and you'll never know ♪ ♪ what tomorrow might bring ♪ ♪ and the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ And the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again, my friend ♪ ♪ is the rain ♪ ♪ all that bad ♪ ♪ and you never know ♪ ♪ what tomorrow will bring ♪ ♪ and the sun will shine ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ again ♪
