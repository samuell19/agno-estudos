[solemn flute instrumental] Can you tell me everything you told him? 1838. President Jackson sent troops and militia to forcibly remove the Cherokee and other tribes from their homelands. My great great grandparents lived in that land before the Great Spirit breathed life. They were forced from their homes to walk thousands of miles, having to bury their family along the way in shallow graves because the ground was too frozen and the soldiers said it took too long to bury them. Trail of Tears. Not America's finest moment in history. One of many. Oro? [laughs] Right. The gold. You know, 3,000 of us died on that trail -all for some-- -Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Please continue. Please. So you know about the Trail of Tears. Did you know that the Cherokee found gold in Dahlonega 10 years earlier? Really? My dad. He used to take my sister and I down to Dahlonega, pan for gold. Never knew the Cherokee found it. Yes, my great great grandfather was one of the tribesmen that found it. Knowing white man's desire for gold, he and the other tribesmen started mining it and hid it. And then word got out and people started to swarm the area for their fortunes. Anybody ever find the gold that your great great grandfather did? No. Because President Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act and the leaders got together and decided to hide it, to never be found. So you know where it is? Is that a, uh, family secret that's passed on for generations? You hear about thousands of people forcibly removed from their rightful homelands and it's like, "Oh, that's such a sad story. I'm sorry to hear about that". Then you hear about a gold mine and it's like, "Oh, hey, yeah, show me the money". No, I just want to find out what happened to my dad. I could tell you what happened to him. -He was murdered. -What? How? He wasn't the only one looking for it. SABAL: With what I'm paying you, I expect results, not excuses. If I wanted excuses, I'd still be married to my second husband. How hard can it be to find one man? He took all of Gerald's research. You find him or you won't be found. [grunts] That idiot is the reason we had to get rid of Gerald.

I'm surrounded by idiots. Talk to them. I refuse to have a battle of wits with unarmed men. -Well, talk to me. -We've got a problem. I thought we got rid of the problem. No, not him. His son. He came for the funeral. He's been poking around. How much does he know? I'm not totally sure. We almost had him the other day but then he disappeared. I could have Donia there in two days. -She can find him. -No, not yet. I think we've been going about this all wrong. We've been getting rid of the competition. Maybe we just need to get out of their way. I think you're taking a big chance. Well, when and if he finds anything, we can just take it from him. True. If anything goes sideways, let me know. I will. [forest din] JIM: So who is this Sabal Fade? -And why'd he kill my dad? -GOLA: She. JIM: You think I care about pronouns? Why did it kill my dad? That's closer to the truth. She's not human. She killed my uncle and anyone else who'd take up the search to find what my ancestors left. Does she have people looking? Always. They're all around town, threatening families, trying to squeeze information out of people. She bought up the land and businesses, trying to corrupt the politicians. She'll do anything and everything. Explains why people were treating me so weird. I just don't understand why dad would take up something so dangerous and not tell me about it. I could have helped him. Protection, probably. The woman is pure evil. And she'll stop at nothing to get what she wants. Sounds like she has enough money already. It's about the power, not the gold. JIM: Right. Wait, what? What power? Gola. -GOLA: Got it. -Got who? GOLA: Breakfast. How do you like your squirrel? I don't. I prefer beef or deer. You ever had squirrel? JIM: My dad and I used to go camping all the time. And when we did, we always hunt. I learned a lot but I never had to eat squirrel. -Let me guess, though. -Please don't say "chicken". Tastes like chicken. So predictable. Really? Did you know I was going to do that? Well? You lied. Tastes like chicken. You were saying. What? Before you went all squirrel hunter on me, you were saying something about power. I asked grandmother, Elisi, if there's so much gold, why hasn't anyone ever found it? Right. Exactly what I was thinking. Elisi told me the tribe shaman traveled to the great Tennessee River to perform a ritual. JIM: Tennessee River. How would that help? GOLA: The Cherokee view the Tennessee River as a kind and helpful spirit. His head rests in the Great Smokies and his feet touch the Tennessee River. JIM: So the, uh, shaman went to this Tennessee River spirit to get some help. -An immortal. -Right, immortal, okay. You know, like a-- Like a vampire. Really? [chuckles] I'm sorry. Look, go ahead. Immortal. There are a group of spirits known as the Immortals. They're invisible unless they want to be seen. They drum and they dance and-- Now when do we hear all this drumming and dancing? You do. In the rumbling of the mountains, in the sounds of the wind. JIM: Well, did this great Tennessee River Immortal help the shaman out? GOLA: He did. He asked him for an object. The only thing he had was an arrowhead that he wore around his neck. It was passed down through generations. The great spirit held out the arrowhead and he prayed, "May every path that you travel be a wide field. May every secret kept from you be revealed. May the winter of your years never be sealed." Wow. That's beautiful. It's beautiful. But it's also dangerous. The arrow head turned to gold and the shaman headed back home. Along the way, the trees and rocks moved out of his way and the hills parted for him to pass. After a few more steps, he realized that old age no longer kept him from running and he felt young again. And he ran all the way home. JIM: So the, the wide fields allowed him to pass through anything and the sealing of his age made him young again? But that's not the worst part of it. When he returned back to the village, everyone came out. But not to greet him. To tell him about every deed they'd ever done. [chuckles] Every secret shall be revealed. What'd he do? He hid the arrowhead and the gold, vowing to never use it again. Wow. You believe? I believe Sabal Fade believes. I believe anyone who possesses it would be unstoppable. -And I believe my grandmother. -Mm. What are you going to do? I know she's looking for it and I want to find it before she does. If the wisest of our tribe thought it was too powerful for him and grandmother thought he was the best of us all, it's the least I could do to protect the world from someone like Sabal Fade. Well, I agree. I'm with you. You know, I don't know if my dad knew about this arrowhead or not or if he was just in it for the gold. But I'm not about to sit back... and let some witch that killed my dad get away with it. I've watched you in the woods. You're pretty good. Well, I'm good with guns. Good with knives. -Really? -Yeah.

What are you going to do? -Shoot me? -[laughs] No. No. [shot blasts] Gola! [grunting] [panting] Okay. Any more threats or are we ready to talk? [strike on table] [pants] We didn't find the arrowhead. [gun cocks] JIM: But we did find the trail. We were going to go out there in the morning. SABAL: Good. Thank you, Jim. So now show me on the map where it is. And we'll go there tomorrow and look for you. And just to show you that we're a full service resort, we'll give you an extra night with full access to all our staff. Until I have the arrowhead in my hand. It was there. Sheriff. Yeah, I know it. I never been there but I know it. There's a waterfall and some fields. All right, take Hawk and the others and go there. -Now. Get it for me. -Hawk, let's go! [Hawk] Roger that. I can't believe my search is almost over. It's been so long. You've done a lot of horrible things through the years. All those innocent lives. You're going to burn for that. I agree. But the good news is I'll live long enough to forget what I've done. And you'll live just long enough to see me get it. [epic music playing] Oh, you're gonna get it. This is for my uncle! [Will Van De Crommert's "Not Our War" playing] ♪ Now I'm down on my knees ♪ ♪ Begging for What God can only know ♪ ♪ What are we fighting for? ♪ [grunting] ♪ What are we fighting for? ♪ ♪ What are we fighting for? ♪ The arrowhead is mine. Stop Sabal. It's over. Oh, it can't be over. I promised my daddy. And I always keep my promises! [gunshot] No. But I always keep mine. ♪♪♪ How? I saw you get shot. I told you that we had to talk about something. Yeah, I'd say, you first start with telling me how you're still alive. -Well, I-- -[Barry yelling indistinctly] Hey. I heard shooting. Is everyone okay in here? Got it all handled, Cherry Barry. Well then, I got someone that's here that wants to say "hello." [night din] [speaking Spanish] Raul! The one and only, papi. [laughs] What? How? Barry told me you have mucho problema. So don't be a fool! BOTH: Call Raul! [quiet laughter] Good to see you. So I take it you guys know each other? Oh, yeah. We go way back. I can't tell you how we met. Or where or what we were doing but si! BOTH: We know each other! So I couldn't find out more than legends and stories but I found this picture and I don't know what it means. [ominous instrumental] Are you all right, papi? You look like you see a ghost. It's not far from the truth. Thanks, man. Thanks for everything. Always, brother. GOLA: I never did like that picture. [emotional piano music playing] So the shaman. Was my uncle. When he removed the arrowhead, it left a drawing tattoo on his chest. Like yours. Yes. Once everyone started traveling on the Trail of Tears, my uncle stayed behind. He needed to keep the arrowhead safe. And grandmother wasn't going to leave him. And I wasn't going to leave grandmother. And she passed away shortly after that. That was over 150 years ago. The arrowhead kept my uncle young. He still aged. In fact, the arrowhead drawing would run low, like a-- like a fuel gauge, and he would get older, but it was like every year was seven years. And when he realized it was just him and me, he put the arrowhead on me so that we can age the same. But my dad. My uncle really liked your dad. And he was close to telling him the truth. And then they were both killed. My uncle was a private man and he didn't even tell me about the arrowhead. I-- I guess he left me these little clues along the way so that I can figure it out in case he wasn't here to tell me. So you surviving that gunshot? I-- I kind of put the arrowhead on so I can do a recharge. Looks like it's almost back to where it was. So you're, like, 200 years old. Give or take a couple of years. Wow. Wow. Well, I... always liked older women. ♪♪♪ Major. Gola. Have you seen this? -[chuckles] -It's another legend about a Navajo headdress. And get this. When you put it on, you can time travel. So I guess we'll have to find it. -I'm in. -Oh, I am not in. I've had enough excitement for one day. But Major, we need a lot of money for an adventure like that. I think I can dig up a little inheritance money.
