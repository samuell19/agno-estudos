I came here because of you, but I'm not silly... - ...illy! - But Miluška... No Miluška, from now again Mrs. Metelková! But... Metuška Milunková... How did I deserve such estrangement? - What did I do, Mrs. Metelková? - You? You nothing. You don't have time. And couldn't do this at all! Jesus Maria! Who did that to you? - Bohouš! - Bohouš? What a rascal, isn't he! But if that's all... - I'll buy you new. - It's not enough the drunk came when I was changing. And broke the bed to boards. He did that too? I'll tell him! I won't let that go! You know, what I'll tell him? "You skunk... you can't do that!" Really, I'll tell him, Miluška. But you have to understand, he likes you. He's lonely here. And you're not a small girl, to be scared, when he jumps in your bed. I'm more a girl than you're a boy, that's why I'm leaving. Miluška... Mrs. Metelková, Jesus, you won't leave me here, big group is here soon, 20 lunches, you know what madness it'll be. I''m give you 200 crowns from my pocket. I didn't come to this haunted house for money, but for ideals. Me too, calm down, Miluška. It's over! Calm down! It's also bad for me, all the inspections. Miluška... Mrs. Metelková! You have no heart! Jesus Maria, I have no heart? Why do I drink? Why do I suffer here? Why did I come? God, I still know it by heart. "Lonely intellectual, 42, 181, mgmt. in hospitality, chief of mountain cabin in beautif. nature. looking for exceptional brunette under 35, cathol., experience in hospitality necess." "Later marriage not excl." "Wandering in nature, privacy in two." - We are mostly alone. - Thanks to mountain tax! I did my part, except I'm not "cathol.", but closest church is 4 kilometers beeline. And your promises, Mr. Illy, also nowhere to be. - How come? Give example? - For example... - Understanding! - I said just yesterday to Bouhouš, how we understand each other! Miluška, have a shot. I want nothing from you. - Or "wandering in nature". - How can we wander, we know it here. I'm wandering from stove to sink. Cleaning, housekeeping, dishwashing, ... All for one salary! With a vague chance that "marriage not excl." - And is it excl.? - It is excl.! - It's not excl.! - It is excl.! - It's not excl.! Like that beautif. nature, look, only mist outside! And the marriage not excl. stays a mystery. Mrs. Metelková, you are right. I'm a monster. A sneaky one. But my life is no fairytale either. My childhood... - Mum gave me up before I was born. - Why was that? I kicked her so hard she fell. Since then I'm... sexually shy. Zilch! You're just lazy! Once in a blue moon we're alone and then that chunker comes. I'm sorry, chunker? Don't talk like that about Bohouš! Even when upset! He saved my life and I won't forget that! That's no reason to make me his popsicle. That darling of yours. I admit I like him. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be here! - Remember how I fell... - Into the gorge, every squirrel knows that. He jumped after you and you both got stuck! - He warmed me with his body to not freeze! - You were always a poet, - but you were just both drunk! - Drunk? Is that a swear word? I don't know it! Bohouš is not to blame! You're the same, you drink and he licks the glasses, the pig. - Did you say pig? - Yes, pig. - You mean me? - No, Bohouš! That's it! You shouldn't've said that. If we were getting romantic you just ruined it. Your money and for the lingerie and you don't exist to me. Ciao. Give kiss to Bohouš. Excuse me. I'm new here who can give me some food? That... colleague. What did I... - Hello. - She's gone? - That woman? - The lady. - Pardon, yes, she is. - Jesus! - Is she in trouble? - I am. - Looking for something? - I am. - Something warm to eat, can I? - Please. Please, choose. Can I get that one? This one's hard to read. Sorry. - But what choosing, I eat anything. - So, beefsteak. Beefsteak then. But quickly, I'm hungry like a St. Bernard. - Excuse me? - What? I said I'm hungry like a St. Bernard. - That's a nonsense. - How come? - You know how hungry I am? - No, but I know how St. Bernard has. - And that's how I am. - Well, a guest is always right. - Thank you. - Even though it's nonsense. - Wait, what did you say? - I was laughing. - No, you said it's a nonsense. I heard that. You want to say I'm stupid? Wait, do you know who I am, I'd never say that about my guest. I spent 15 years in England, I speak 3 languages, I was teaching royal etiquette. What about 3 languages, I saw a donkey doing math. - See, I am a planner... - A planner and eat more than a St. Bernard. Why do you insist on that, so I said it. I can bet on that! - Bet, you say? - Sure, for all money. Bet, okay. Bet, my friend, I'm taking you at your word. - How come? What word? - You're on vacation? - Yes. - How long? - Three weeks. - Great. - Are you married? - Sure. That means you know housework, making the bed, cooking and others? I don't understand, but as every man today, right... If you eat as much as St. Bernard, you have your vacation for free. - Here, for free? - Sure. - That'll be expensive for you. Leave that to me. But if you don't eat as much... - Then what? - You'll have to work here and also for free. - Deal? - But wait, that's... - You're caving! - Not at all! This is all just platonic talking, we don't have that St. Bernard, you know? Bohoušek! - Whoa. What is this? - What is it, that's Bohoušek! Get outta town, this is not Bohoušek, that's a cupboard! His name is Barry of Bedfordshire, but Bohouš is easier to say. And we're mostly alone here, what would I talk about with a Sir. I can talk about anything with Bohouš, right? - He talks? - Yes, right, every dog talks with eyes. This one understands everything. You can talk to him about football and women. - And he cheers for Slavia, right? - Sadly, he's a fan of Glasgow. His mother is Scottish. But he loves Czech cuisine, right? Wait, Bohouš, what do you say, how about goulash? Or... schnitzel? See? See how he understands? He prefers schnitzel. - What is it? - I'm hungry, that's my stomach! - Sorry. Let's start. - Let's. What does he eat? - He? Everything. Right? And you? - Also. I'm not picky. Well, he is, last week he ate a bucket of swill. - But wait, I choose food, right? - Of course. - Good. - So, deal? - Yeah. Just to recap, if I eat as much as him, I win and spend here 3 weeks for free. And vice versa, if you don't eat as much, you spend 3 weeks here as a maid, also for free. Here it is, excuse me, Bohouš first, he'd be scared, that there's not enough. Give him properly. - And now for you. Mind your plate. - That's enough. Isn't it too hot? No, I'm doing it for him, he can't blow it. Keep it up, guys. Should've given him mudguards. He's splashing around. Slow down, Bohoušek, nobody's rushing you. - What next? - Doesn't matter, the rest. Great, so from the top. Roast beef, with dumpling, or rice? - What he prefers. - He doesn't care, right? - Dumpling then. But double! - Excellent! Well. Twice roast beef, double dumpling. No provocations, Bohoušek! - What? - Sorry. Hey, Bohouš, I've seen many bloated bernards. Don't overeat. That was two tripe soups, two roast beefs, and now... livers with rice. Look, a rose blossoms, look... Livers with rice. Livers with rice. Spanish bird, dumpling. Spanish bird, dumpling. Mexican goulash, potatoes. Mexican goulash, potatoes. - What is it, can't anymore? - Not at all! - Slowing down? We haven't even started, Bohouš, right? - What will be next? - What? Well, next. I'd recommend white pudding, homemade, well marbled. - Okay, white pudding. - Really? Great. Look. Bohoušek, we're having white pudding. Bohouš, bark that you're full or something. What he'll bring you will be disgusting! You ever ate it, made out of a deaf pig? There you go. Two puddings, one better than the other. - Which one would you like? - Show me that one. - Warning, this one has thicker skin. - This one then. Whoa, you're brave. If you allow, I'll cut it, so he doesn't swallow it as a pill. Don't worry, Bohoušek, you'll get. I know you can't wait. There. And you can start. Now that I'm looking at you, the apron will fit you well. Look. Miluška was fuller in chest, but you can fold it, like I do. Don't hurry with apron. It's still a draw. I don't think so. Bohoušek ate the skin too. Right, Bohoušek? We ate the skin. We did. - Do you have mustard? - But of course, there's enough. Is it good enough, or should I fetch krems mustard? - Krems? From where? - Or you want ketchup? No, this one is enough. - It makes it... - Spicy? I know, I'd like Becher, but you don't have, do you? Sure I do, small or large? - Bigger. - Excellent! - To Bohouš too! - Of course! - You think I'd cheap on Bohoušek? - What, he drinks Becherovka? What a question. Bohoušek, show mister. See? Now he'll digest and won't know he ate anything. But you're having trouble with the peel. Well well, look Bohouš, mister can't eat anymore. He's barely chewing, damn. And we'd like to have some more... What do you say, chinese can, or brisket, I have a fatty brisket. Or as a dessert, cheese? I have homemade, matured. - What do you say? - Nothing. - But that means... - Also nothing. It's a sin to eat such nice skin alone, without anything. Bring us two slices of bread. To both of us. Okay, okay, with pleasure. There you go, bread, help yourself. It looks good. - Give him also. - Of course, Bohoušek... What is it? Take the bread. Come on, take the bread. Nice, smells nice, fresh bread. Bohouš! Eat! Eat! Come on. Bite for mum, bite for dad. Bohouš! - Open up. Open your mouth! You stupid! - Maybe he's full. How full? He has to! I'd... If I had... Bohouš! Come here! Come back! Bohouš! You lazy bastard! Ran away through backdoors. You know, when an animal is full, you can't force it... Nonsense. Just talks. Bohouš is a smart dog. But I get you. He's overfed, spoiled, spoiled bastard. I'll tie him up, until he begs for a bread crust! You get that for your love, and goodwill, only disappointment. Only disappointment! Dear God! I knew it, I knew it! Lucky for Bohouš, he came to bring me back! My sweety, you wanted to hang yourself because your girl left. You can't! You can't! Your girl came back! Bohouš saved your life again. Give me the ugly rope, give me. Mrs. Metelková, we're not alone... Miluš. - Don't let me disturb. That's your wife? - Future wife. Right, Alois? Right... Jesus Maria! Yes, tourists. Miluška, warm up soups! And meanwhile, you could... - Pardon me? - Ah sorry, you won. But hurry, quickly! Ah, mister is back. Mister Bohouš is back. But we're done talking. We're done, I said! Don't try to snuggle up. You rascal. I'll never forget this! You choosey animal! - Mr. waiter! - I know, you won, you don't pay. No, I mean, I'm quite hungry after that Becherovka. I'd need something small, some delicacy...
