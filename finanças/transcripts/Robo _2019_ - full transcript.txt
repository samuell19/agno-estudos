Document the telemetry. - I don't understand. - What's wrong? Try to stay calm. Shut it down please. MALFUNCTION Let's begin again. ROSTEKO A catastrophe. No, not yet. Bravo. Keep it going. ROSTEKO A-112 TEST NO. 310 "I'M NOT A ROBOT." That's perfect. - You see. - Very good. - Thank you. - That's how it's done. Once again. MITYA UNANSWERED CALL. ENTER A MESSAGE. I'M BUSY. CALL DAD! Nadja, when should the tests start? How about in 20 Minutes. Mitja's calling all the time. Could you please call him back? Oh. - Talk quick. - Papa, my belly aches. Do I really have to go to math? Yes. You gotta stay, Mitja. Must I remind you again, huh? Enough with all the calls. You disturb Mama and me at work. - Pop, my tummy is bad. Pop. - Mitja, listen, mathematics is very important. You will have a great advantage when you go out and start to look for jobs. Now, get yourself together, young man. Don't forget, Math is the queen of science. So long. But, Pop...! Hmm. Pop, oh, Pop. Pop, oh, Pop! And? Okay. It's not important. Don't bother with it. Turn him back on. Always remember. Mathematics is the queen of all the sciences. There's no career where you won't need it. What about artists? No, Da Vinci never needed Mathematics. You are mistaken. Actually, we know that Da Vinci was the first to use the golden ratio. Mathematics informed all of his painting. Additionally, he was an engineer, mechanic and inventor. I know that you probably know some of Da Vinci's greatest inventions. For example, the hang glider, or the helicopter, the scuba suit, he invented the parachute, the tank, and even a robot knight. He did it all with mathematics. The great da Vinci. But Mitja is more like da Wimpy. Calm down, children. Quiet! We're going to have a little pop quiz. A112, give me your status report. All systems of the Rescue Robot A112 are in working order. Mm-hmm. W... What's with the voice? That's very strange. Have you got any other voice modules? To continue communicating, please choose one of the following voice modules. "Wise, old man." "Fearless Pirate." "Scary Goblin." "Fairy Godmother." No, stop! What's going on here? Which one of you was it? Get rid of the voices. Which one of you was it? I'm very sorry. It was just an idea. What's the problem? It was me. Nadja, you think it's funny? A fairy godmother? I have to present him to the Director. Whatever. We can't change it in the moment. We have to meet the commission. Let's go. Bring him to the car. We're leaving in 15 minutes. Why doesn't anyone want to hear my "fearless pirate"? "All hands on deck!" "Tie up the filthy mutineer!" Harrrr! "Anchor's Away!" Now pencil's down and turn in your work. Very impressive. That looks wonderful. - Olga. It's like you. - Yeah, it looks like you. With lots of imagination. If this was drawing class, I am sure you would get an "A" from me. But this is math... I can only give you an "F". I'll give your notebook to your father. Congratulations. Great Job, Tiny. Danger. Danger. Terrible train accident. Extreme fire and smoke have been detected. I will start the search for survivors immediately. - Help! I'm here! - Survivor's Voice detected. - I need help. - Initiation of Program 8 - to save the human. - Help! Help! Help me. - Good day, human. - Hey, dude To continue communicating, please choose one of the following voice modules. "Wise Old Man." "Fearless Pirate." "Scary Goblin." "Stupid General"! Do You find this humorous? That took 40 Seconds. Our fictional victim... suffered smoke inhalation. He has succumbed to his injuries and is now dead. I don't agree. A112 arrived at the accident site and discovered the injured person within the time perimeters that we've chosen. No, it took 40 Seconds. The test is a failure. Let's go to the next scenario. A survivor is buried underneath the ruins of a collapsed building. A112's job is to find him and free him. Survivor, listen carefully. I'm here to help you. Follow my instructions. First, go straight ahead for ten feet. Get ready. After 18 feet, take a 90 degree turn to the right. Attention, Survivor. You have left the specified route. - You're going the wrong way. - Enough. Calculating a new route. Let's stop this circus. How should anyone who is buried underneath rubble, orient themselves? Absolutely unacceptable. A112 could remove some of the rubble. It's unnecessary. Let's move on to the next scenario. Situation analysis has begun. Steel beam is unstable. Possible cause of death. Initiating rescue operation. Five, four, three, two, one. I... hurry... to rescue... ...ro rescue... ...to rescue! System is stuck. Reboot. Initiating Rescue. Human, hold on. I am coming. Rescue operation successfully completed! Applause, applause! Just put the flowers in my dressing room. Right now, I'm carrying my grandfather. I'd like to know why the robot didn't try to... save the child, huh? He was systematic. He prioritized the adult. Even wild animals first save their babies from danger. The mother and child should have come first. Imagine it was your family. Your robot is unable to make human judgements. Mr. Nikolajewitsch, we are talking about - programming that can... - Now... practical test was unsuccessful. This commission will not approve the A112. And would you please revise his voice. He has passed every technical test, and you have seen that it functions perfectly. Strong, robust and fast. As a lifesaver he's perfect. A real lifesaver is not just about strength and speed. We're saving real people. To help them, we must be able to... communicate. Your robot has big problems with communication. You need to thoroughly rework... robot A112. - Hmm. I don't have one. - And Mama always calls him "hunter". - "Hunter?" Hm? - Yeah. And that dog is completely crazy. - That would be great. - He already killed a fox. - A fox? - Yeah, a full-grown fox. My Papa had it stuffed right away. Hey, Mitja. How are you? Hello, Uncle Grant. Working hard? You must have straight A's, huh? Don't think so. The teacher asked for Dad. Where's the problem? I'll play your father. Thanks, Uncle Grant. But it would definitely go wrong. You're right. Well, that's how it is today, because girls just rule the world. Would you like the studio key so that you can draw? Thanks a lot. But today... I don't feel like drawing anymore. I better wait for my father at home. See you. - So long, Mitja. - Bye. What a terrible day. First the commission and now Mitja's school. The moon is... in Scorpio. Taurus's are out of luck. Is it clear what happened to us today? Everything went perfectly in the computer simulations. Tell me what's wrong? Why don't you answer? I was assembled in May, so I am a Taurus. Just like you. And Taurus's weren't lucky today. That's not what I asked. What's going on with you, hmm? I understand. The answer to your question is... I'm distracted by the image on your desk. What is that? What kind of a question is that? Our Family. A picture of our family. In the last test scenario, should I have saved the family first? That is absolutely irrelevant. Where are these thoughts coming from? I want to know what that is... a family. A family is papa, mama, son, daughter, dog. Whatever. Hmm. Understood. That means you are my family. I am your son. No, you are our Robot. And you don't do what I want. I am very upset. Then you should ground me. You absolutely have to change his voice, Katja. I don't care if it's the "Wise Old Man." Yes, I'll do it right away. I would like to know what a family is. I'm very sorry, boss. I'm very sorry. Today is just not my day. So, where is our da Vinci? - What happened? - What happened? See for yourself. His teacher gave me that. Oh, my goodness. And by the way, he drew that when he should have been studying math. Just guess what grade he got. Another "F"? Do you know what it costs for us to send you to that school? Anyway, talk to your father. I'm making dinner. Talk to me, Dimitri. Do you really want to be a artist? It's not a profession. What's going on with you? Your best friend is the janitor. You're always drawing in class.. Do you want to end up like that? I thought you wanted to be an engineer, just like your papa and mama are, hmm. I don't want to be like you. I'm disappointed. Let's have dinner. Voice module for "Wise Old Man" activated. Historic source of information discovered. Starting scan. SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL DICTIONARY Fahrenheit, fairytale, ah, family. "In biology, the classification of living organisms. "Higher than a genus, lower than an order. "The name of the biological family is capitalized, "ergo feline for the family that includes all types of cats..." This information is superfluous. The door is locked. Excuse me. I need to get through this door. I have to find my family. This is important. If you would please open the door for me. Unidentified person. The door remains locked. Unfortunately, I must get through here. IN SERVICE Hey, you idiot! You got a death wish? Good evening, human. - Thank you for this information. - Hmm. Are you driving to the family? No, back to the depot. Family's at home. Understood. Thank you very much and God bless you. Why are you dressed like that? Halloween's over. A costume? No. I... always look like this. What a freak. Get off the street! It's dangerous. Get off the street. It's dangerous. You freak. - Good evening, humans. - Oh shit. Whoa! Rescue operation successfully completed. Stop. No wait. Stay here. Come back. Human, can we be a family? Human? Wait. Come back. Human! Wait. You're welcome. I'm sorry, but you are exceeding the permissible noise level by a considerable amount. - Satan. - Oh man. - 50.2 decibels. - Satan. This noise level is not permitted at night. Children are sleeping. Why are you running, humans? Children must be protected. Now could we... talk about family? Hey, where are you? I want to go to my family. Oh. Interesting. I understand. Route calculated. Let's go. Viktor, wait a minute. Don't be upset. There's a problem. To get upset, I'd need information. Is the A112 on fire? Worse. He ran away. Listen to me for a moment, children. You know that our school is a partner school with school number 342 in Minsk. The children in Belarus have challenged us to a robot building competition. We've been asked to build a robot that will then compete against other robots. That's why I suggest you register for Robotic Technology, taught by our popular physics teacher, Mr. Garnikowitsch. - That sounds exciting! - Cool! - I'll definitely be there. - Wow! And he has a chainsaw hand. Mitja, aren't you interested in joining? No. But you are quite a good artist. Hey, da Vinci, how about a Mona-Lisa-Robot? - Calm down everyone, okay? - Paint one yourself. Location: residential building. 770 feet above sea level. Condition of the building: moderate. In need of a renovation. Hm-hm. You have reached your destination. Start analysis of the door lock. Standard built-in lock. No alarm system available. Easy target for burglars. I greet you, cybernetic organism. Why are you dressed like that, you freak? Halloween. A reflection. Family! I have found you. I am finally with the family. Good. I need to hide. Quickly. Quickly. "Paint us a robot". No way. They are annoying. With their math, their robots. Paint it yourself. Stupid robots. Here you are. The moisture level of your hands is above normal. You need to dry them well. Hello, small human. Caution. Risk of injury. Limb damage possible. Act according to program no.3. Small human. Where are you going? I just want to help. And I'm right here. You should accept my help. However, I need to examine you. Small human. Why are you running away from me? You urgently need first aid. Small human, I'm already here. Commence with injury scan. No broken bones, skin surface still intact, no muscle or nerve damage, just a slight bruise. By the time you get married, everything will be fine. You will survive, small human. Hallelujah. Who are you? Me? A112, Universal Rescue Robot. So how did you get our apartment key? I don't need a key. This was the destination of my calculated route. For further communication, please choose one of the following voice modules. "Wise Old Man." "Fearless Pirate." "Scary Goblin." "Fairy Godmother." "Old Housewife." "Stupid General," but everyone always starts to laugh. If you ask me, I like "Wise Old Man" the best. What do you think? Me, too. Good, then we'll stay with "Wise Old Man". So you're a robot? According to my matrix. I thought you were a clown at first. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. I'm not a clown, not Satan, not an idiot, and not a freak. I am the Universal Rescue Robot A112 Presentation ended. And... tell me why are you here? I'm looking for my family. Your robot wife and kids? No. I'm looking for Mama and Papa. I have an image of them here. Look. Is that your family? Yes? Why don't you answer? That's no family. They only care about themselves. They sent me to this stupid school... for physics and math. I didn't want that. Because I want to be an artist, but they don't like that... and now they're disappointed. Amazing. We have that in common. Everyone is disappointed in me. Especially Mama and Papa. I understand you. Disappointed? Not in you. It is true. I was programmed to always tell the truth. What's your name? I'm Dimitri. - Dimitri? - Yes. But everyone calls me Mitja. Mitja. Nice to meet you. I am A112. Universal Rescue Robot. My pleasure. A112 is only a construction number, you need a real name. If you say so. Hundred-twelve-y? - Hundred-twelve-y? - No. Clownie? No. - Robo. - Robo? Is it good? You like it? Robo. Robo. I agree. Robo sounds great. A nickname for robots. Robo. Robo. I like it a lot. So this monster is now on the run. It's not a monster. You misunderstand. It's completely harmless. It's programmed to be non-violent. Yes. It's programming contains Asimov's three robotic laws. - I can guarantee you... - You guarantee? This is an act of violence. You no longer have your robot under control. - Listen, we will... - When something can be this violent, it will have no qualms about attacking people. Your robot is dangerous and will therefore be disassembled. No further discussion. - Send out a search unit. - Mm-hmm. Find the documents. Yes. Nadja? Where's our photo? It was hanging there. Is it gone? Strange. I have to go home for a moment because I forgot something. Carry on without me. Will you be gone long? No. I'll be quick. He said, "We're saving real people. "To help them, we must be able to... "communicate. "Your robot has big problems with communication. "A real lifesaver is not just about strength and speed. You need to thoroughly rework robot A112." Hmm. Well, I guess robots also have their own problems. That's bad luck. Exactly. Hmm. An orange. Citrus family. Orange juice. In large parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and western Germany. more rain has fallen in the last 24 hours than normally falls over the course of two months. There has been extensive flooding of towns, cities, as well as numerous farms throughout the effected area. A disaster. Perhaps they need my help. I must go there. Tell me, how are you going to do that? To travel you'll need a Visa and a credit card. I understand. Crap. Hide. - That's impossible. - You have to hide. - Hello, Mitja. - Papa. I forgot something this morning. Tell me where it is, I'll get it for you. Uh... I think, in the kitchen. This week we are launching a brand-new, very exciting game show on Russian television... - So, where is it? - Mm. Not here. No? Maybe in the living room, or bedroom. What exactly are you looking for? This one little thing. Did you find it? No. Are you... alright? I'm doing homework. I have to finish five equations. But otherwise everything is fine. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. I must have... already taken it with me. Is everything okay between you and me? Yes. Now if there was... something wrong, you would talk to me, right? Uh-huh. I promise. Okay. - See you later. - Bye-bye. Danger over. "Okay" is a nice word. Unfortunately, I have no idea what it means. "Okay", means that something's neither bad, nor good. Okay... I don't understand. Don't worry about it. Just look it up on the internet. Okay. So? How's it going? Good. No Problem. You learn really fast. I process data at a thousand terabytes per minute. Oh, wow. That's cool. - Enough for now. - But why? Well, my parents are coming home soon, we have to go. Where? You'll see when we get there. But now promise you won't tell anyone. - Okay? - Don't worry. This information is password protected at the highest security level. Let's go, smart aleck. Look who's talking. I got the key from the janitor. This is my studio. Just Like da Vinci's. Should I say "That's okay"? "Cool" would be better. Got it. Ah. Very comfortable. Violation of fire protection regulations. Storage of too much flammable paper. - It's not just paper. - What is it? These here... Technical schematics? No, comics. This one, is the Dark Vigilante. He ensures law and order in the city and fights villains. A colleague. There is no symmetry in these drawings. It is symmetrical. It's art. It's not just about symmetry. Very often. Believe me. Here's a sheet of paper. Show me. Go ahead. Prove it. This is symmetrical art. That is kid's stuff. It's art when it is beautiful. Mine are beautiful. Look at these. Please define "beautiful". Take a look for example... hmm... - at... - Yes? At... oh. That there. A sunset. I understand. Sunset. The moment when the top of the sun disappears behind the horizon. The term "sunset" also refers to the entire process of the sun setting on the horizon. Shorter. Just say it's "cool" or "beautiful". Yes. Art is something beautiful and cool. Wait here. Cool. I'll wait. What's that? A secret symbol. Leonardo da Vinci used to... sign his work with it. They are also my initials. Dmitri Viktorowitsch. - Should I paint one for you, too? - Yes, please. That would be great. Right there. That's really, really cool. Now are we a family? Even better, now we are friends. Friends. I have to go. - You stay here. Okay? - Mm. When will you return, friend? Tomorrow after school. So, if you're bored, draw something. Okay. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, my friend. Mitja, is everything cool? It's cool. Friends are cool. Sunsets are art. Our squad searched the entire south-east of the city. We found no trace of A112. He's smart. Search the attics and basements of all apartment buildings. We must include the police commissioners in the search. Uh-huh. I want results by 5 pm tomorrow. And send the press secretary to me. I'm already here, Mr. Nikolayevich. Compile images for the media that clearly demonstrate how dangerous this robot is. We need to warn the public. The Moscow Security Authority is asking for the public's help to identify and capture a dangerous, high-tech robot that has gone rogue. We are referring to an experimental robot prototype whose programming is incorrect. This experimental robot is currently hiding in an unknown location in Moscow. We are asking for your assistance to find this robot. If you have any information call our hotline, or report it to any police station. Why aren't you eating? Don't you like it? No, it tastes fine. Did something happen? I met the director today. They will probably close the laboratory. Because of him? Uh-huh. Who is "him"? That's just for adults. Pop? Long story. We designed a prototype robot, and the robot escaped. It's not funny. We all worked very hard on it. If we don't find him, the lab will be closed and Mom and I will lose our jobs. What if you find him? Then we will fix the mistakes in the programming and continue the project. What about the robot? He'll probably be destroyed. Yes. Hmm. Don't you have something to tell us? No, Pop. Nothing. Thanks, Mama. It was good. I have checked everyone's homework and I'm very happy. Now we start a new subject. Yes. Miss Petrowna, I have a question? What is it, Anton? Did you hear the news about the dangerous robot - that has escaped? - Yes, of course. We're supposed to build a robot. What if he's aggressive, too? You don't have to build one. I'm not going to force you. And this Robot is an absolute exception. Robots are always useful helpers. Now, back to work. Please write down your homework assignment for tomorrow. - Hey, what's that? - Anton! - What are you doing? - Don't do it. Stop it. That's for our project. Oh no. She's gonna take it. You're so busted. It was Mitja. It wasn't me. I'll discuss this with your father. Very good. Everyone gets three chances. They reported about the escaped robot again today. - Did you see it? - Great. Again. If we could catch that robot, we would win the competition. That's too dangerous. You said that the robot is aggressive. Of course it's dangerous. What do you think? How else could it escape? When we find this stupid robot, we should take it apart - and turn it into a toaster. - Yeah. Good idea. You won't take it apart and he's not stupid. Oh really? Thanks Einstein! He even understands art. Are you sure about that? Did you invent it, da Vinci? - He's lying through his teeth. - I'm not lying. Oh, so sorry. You're not lying. You're just having fantasies like a little girl. Why are you such a jerk. Can't you just leave Mitja alone. Now get lost. You little liar. Is that necessary? Yeah. - I'm not a liar! - Get him, Anton! You two break it up right now. I said, stop it! Mitja, Anton, break it up. Get in line. You won. Now I've got you, you bucket of tin. Leave him alone! Hi, Mitja. What's new? - Why isn't the door locked? - Should I lock us up? Robo and I, we're ah... are drinking tea and playing cards. A Jack and another Jack. And another. I just taught him and he is already killing me. Thanks to a good teacher. A Grand Master. What's wrong? You look worried. Is something bothering you? All of Moscow wants to destroy you. But that is illogical. Everyone says you're dangerous. But that's just nonsense. Robo is a great, ah... great guy. - Thank you. - He'd never hurt anyone. But he can't stay here. Where shall I go? I know where. Yesterday, my brother-in-law came back from Vologda. It is so completely remote, no one would look there. Stupidly, the forest is on fire right now. No problem. Robo can save people there and prove to everyone that he is not dangerous. Good plan. Will you join me, friend? My parents will never let me go. I understand. I don't think he has to leave. - Hmm? - Nobody will find him up here. Grant, are you in there? - Who is that? - That is Stepanitsch. The police chief here. He's a great guy. Stepanitsch, how's it going? Open the door right now. We have to search your attic. What do you mean "we", huh? Soldiers from the Moscow Security Office and me. Open the door. Sorry, I can't. I, uh... I'm naked. I'm warning you, this is not a joke. We are looking for a runaway robot. It's dangerous. Anyone who is hiding this robot will be severely punished. So if you don't open the door right now, we'll open it by force. I'm counting to three. - One... - Now they've caught us. Don't worry, my friend. Two... - Scan Surrounding. - W-w-wait. Stop counting. - Let's discuss this. - Possible escape route? Three! Let's Go. Warning, friends in danger. Start emergency evacuation. Go. Get out of here. I'll hold them off. Yes, but... you might get hurt. I'll be fine. I'm just the Janitor. - Sounds logical. - Thanks, Uncle Grant. Now you take good care of my boy. Go! Good luck, Grand Master Grant. - Take care. I'll see you soon. - You're a great guy. That way. Go get him. Scanning. Escape Route. I have found a way out of here. Hop on now. - Whoa. - Let's go. - A112! Don't move! - Don't listen to them. They'll take you apart. Now, jump! My friend's wish is my command. Then go. Central command. Send reinforcements. A112 has a hostage. Block his path. Hold on tight, my friend. The Moscow Security Agents unsuccessfully attempted to capture the A112. The prototype robot escaped from a laboratory yesterday. The robot avoided the police. Possibly taking hostage an innocent nine-year old child with him. A certain Dmitri V in an impressive escape by rooftop. Sir, please tell us what happened. If I can say something... here in Moscow we janitors are increasingly lacking properly functioning and good quality cleaning equipment. In order to keep buildings clean, - we need new mops, we... - We want to hear a few words about robot A112. Oh. Uh, Robo... Robo is really a great guy. Thank you. Now back to the studio. It's not true. You didn't take me hostage. Some people see things differently than others. I have communication problems. - And, that needs to change. - No. You're one of the good guys. You're perfect. Got it? "The good guys?" Does that mean "high quality." Good means... just good. Just good. Is good something like cool? It's way better than cool. Is this a good place to hide? Yes. The chances of being discovered here are only 1 out of 100. Okay? Okay. Aren't you cold? Huh. Robots do not need an external heat source. But I will help you get warm, friend. Not too bad. Here. Wrap this around you. Thanks, Robo. My pleasure. What else are you hiding? Oh. 246 useful tools and instruments were built into my design. This way I can assist humans during all manner of catastrophes. I was programmed to create a safe space for all affected people in virtually every situation. Uh-huh. That's cool. Yes, it is. Now you'll warm up. Wow. One disadvantage. Humans depend on external heat sources. So you are imperfect. And we're always hungry. That too. Here. No thank you, my friend. I don't use those energy sources. What I don't understand is how imperfect beings like you, could construct something as perfect as me. I am simply perfect. You're so modest, Robo. To be a robot... is really cool. And now, my friend, curtain up. - Enjoy the show. - What is that? "MOTHER FOR A LITTLE MAMMOTH" That's for little kids. I know. But I like it. Look... to me this is something like art. The person you are calling cannot be reached at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Something is bothering you, my friend. What is wrong? For the very first time, Mama couldn't wish me "good night" last night. No problem. I can bring you home in exactly 23 minutes and 8 seconds. If you would like me to. No. They'll take you apart. I don't want that. You are right. They will catch me and disassemble me. Okay. You are a good friend, Mitja. So tell me, why can't I reach our son? Hey, calm down. It's probably nothing. Maybe his battery is dead. We were the ones that developed that damn robot, and now, it has taken our son, of all people, and it might hurt him. Mitja will be just fine. We developed the robot to save human lives. It's just a big lump of steel, that can't communicate with it's surroundings. Grant told me that he had a conversation... Stop it, please. Enough, I mean it. That idea is completely insane. A fairytale about a Robot who becomes friends with our son? That is simply impossible. It wasn't approved because it can't communicate. Forget about empathy. So our son is now a hostage. - Hello? - Mr. Priwalow. - This is the police. - You found him? Unfortunately not, but we are not giving up. We are now working with volunteers and have expanded the search area. I hope we know more tomorrow. Thank you, ma'am. Nadja, go to bed. I'll stay awake. Tell me please, how am I supposed to sleep? I created a robot, but lost a son. Good morning, my friend. Good morning. I dreamed that they found us, because you look like a robot. Factually, I am a robot. No. what I mean... you see immediately that you are a robot. - Then I need a disguise. - Yes. We need to find some clothes. Where can we find some? Listen, my Papa plans his entire day - every single morning. - Uh-huh. So will we. First, we need to find you something to wear. - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. Then we'll get tickets - and somehow get to Vologda. - Mm-hmm. We'll prove to everyone there you're a hero. Perfect. Good plan. No, a really cool plan. I like this plan. Let's do it. We still have to lay the cables on the upper floors. They, the... they've found us. The situation is unclear. I need data. Wait here, my friend. I'll be right back. Start scan of surroundings. That stuff needs to go upstairs. I know. I'll go get a hand truck. - Huh. - But don't take the one... Summary: worker. Distance: less than 60 feet. Scan complete. Information summary: construction workers have arrived to work on this construction site. We are not in danger. Mitja, they are definitely... not Policemen. - Should we leave? - Are you positive we... can sneak past this workers? You are looking at perfection. Did you forget that? New escape route discovered. Start the evacuation. Get on. As always, another perfect landing. Shall we? So friends, we're in for some bad weather, there is a tornado moving in with lightning, heavy rains and strong winds of up to 60 miles per hour. My advice? Stay home, snuggle up on your couch with a cup of tea and keep listening. This is Ivan and as always, I'll be playing the best music in the city. The police still have nothing. All we can do is wait. I've got bad news. I know it's bad timing, but today... they came in and shut down the lab. They told us we have to be completely out by noon. Okay. I'll wait downstairs. Alright. It's what I thought. I'll go to the lab. Go. Hurry. Sure. If anything happens, I'll call you. I don't see anyone. I will scan the surrounding area. Get down. Will you? Oh! Of course, General. - I'll find some clothes. - Uh-huh. Stay here. Now stay hidden. Okay. Hey, kid! What are you doing here? I... uh... Busted, huh? What is a little boy like you, who should be in school doing here, and especially little thieving schoolboys? That's our home. Bug off. What did you steal? Show us! I didn't steal anything. Excuse me? Huh? And what's this? You see. That's not mine. Anyway, it's all state property. You're not part of the circus. What are you doing here? I need some clothes for a friend. - Ah, so there are two of you. - Ah-ha Where's your friend? Let's see him. - Is he here? - Hello. Friend. Friend. I'm here! - Whoa! - Don't be afraid. What do you want from us? We need clothes and boots. - Ah! And my motorcycle! - No, no motorcycle. I am faster when I run. Right, Mitja? No motorcycle. Just some clothes. Mitja, are you sure I am less noticeable in this costume? There are clowns here everywhere. But I am not a clown. I am Robo. Of course I know that. Let's sit right there. I need a little break. Good afternoon, human. How are you today? Do you like your city? Are you happy in Moscow? Hey. Stop it, okay? Excuse my friend. He is from Saint Petersburg. Yes. Saint Petersburg, fourth largest city in Europe and also the cultural center of Russia. Ma'am. Did I say something wrong? Where is she going? To Saint Petersburg. I told you to leave her alone. Here. Read the newspaper, CITY OF CULTURE and stay here. I'm going to get our tickets. Information received. I'll wait. Look it's Tiny. The whole world is looking for you and you're walking calmly down the street. Mitja, what are doing here? We're all worried about you. I am just... here... by accident. You know, If I would run away, I would be hide some place really wonderful. Robo, come here. Take the mask off. Are you sure? Your wish is my command. - I don't believe it. - It's the Robot from TV. - Wait. - Let's get out of here. He's harmless. He's one of the good guys. He's my friend. He is correct. I am a universal rescue robot. What do you call your friend? Mitja gave me... the name... Robo. My pleasure. Oh. Nice to meet you. Why is he dressed like a clown, Mitja? Because he's in disguise. We're hiding. It's a long story. At first, I hid him upstairs in my attic. Good afternoon, Mr. Nikolayevich. May I ask you something? Don't you think you are acting a little too hastily here in this matter? No, I don't think so. Your robot poses a great danger to the public and I will certainly not take any chances in this matter. From this point on, no artificial intelligence and no more robots. Only human beings, remote-controlled machines and good old fire extinguishers. - Do you understand? - Please, listen. It's a mistake. The future belongs to robotic intelligence. A112 will prove valuable, believe me. He's already proven himself, when he took your son. And as soon as we have found it, I will throw it in the incinerator myself. Yeah, it's me. No, no, I'm on my way to you. If you want, you can wait here with him while I get the tickets. So? But not a word to anyone, okay? - I promise. - Yeah. Sure. See you. I'll hurry. And thank you. You're welcome. Mitja said that you two jumped from roof to roof. - Mm-hm. - Is it true? Yes. This information is correct. I can jump distances of up to 130 feet. No way! Show me. - No way? - Don't do it, Anton. Are you ready? Why are you filming that? To put it online, duh. How was that. Great. Let's take a selfie together. Huh. A selfie. That is cool. I am simply perfect. Don't do it, Anton. I'm gonna post it. By tonight, I'll have millions of likes. We can't say anything. I didn't promise that loser anything. You were the one making promises. I think You're really mean. So what? I'm gonna be famous. You two have problems with communication. Correct? ATTENTION, SEARCH IN PROGRESS: PRIVALOV, DMITRY VIKTOROVICH, 12 YEARS, BROWN EYES, BORN 04.10.2004 They're searching for the boy. I heard. We used to hunt for criminals. Now, we search for kids. Look at that. There's the boy. Hello, young man. Wait a moment. My name is Wolkow. How can I help you? Where are you going? Hello? Is this Victor Alexandrowitsch? Yes. Who's calling? Officer Poljakowa, Moscow police. Do you have a son named Dmitri Viktorowitsch? Yes. That's right. Good news, we've found your son. He's perfectly fine. He's here at the station, looking out the window. I'll give you the address. Thank you. I'm on my way. You never told me your name. Olga. Olga. A lovely name. Where did your friend Anton go? is he your friend? I thought he was a friend, but he is just a traitor. Then I guess he is... a traitor. I have a question. First, Mitja was my friend, now Robo and Olga are also friends. Is Mitja also Olga's friend? Excuse me, sir? You should see this. Kolja, play the video. That's him. - You're really mean. - So what? - I'm gonna be famous. - We finally have him. Who shot that video? A young student with an encrypted IP. We tracked him down. Anton Olegowitsch Semjonov, School 720, Class 2C. I think we should pay a visit to the little celebrity. K5. - K5? - Mm-hmm. K5, K5, K5. No... Mitja. Son. Oh, thank God. Are you ok? How do you feel? Good. - I'm just fine. - I'm so relieved. I assume that you are his father? That's right. Now you have your little gangster again. Yeah, my little gangster. Why do you call him "gangster"? Because he wouldn't tell the police officers anything. And the robot? How did you get away? I didn't have to escape. Robo is my friend. He's hiding from all of you. Mitja... Mitja, do you know what we've been through? We thought he kidnapped you, but you just ran away. I didn't run away. Robo really needs my help. Why do you call him "Robo"? It's just a machine. Robot A112. He's not just a machine. Tell me, how did you get him to follow orders, hmm? I didn't give him orders. We talked to each other, then we figured out what we had to do. Hmm. Don't joke now. That's not possible. The robot was not approved because it couldn't communicate. - So don't lie to me. - I'm not lying. You always say, to concentrate on important things. Now, I have something important to do. Okay, son. Now why don't you tell me where he is. No way. Why not? Because I know you'll destroy him, won't you? Mitja, listen. Your mother and I have invested over five years in this. You can't imagine just how much we've sacrificed. Believe me, I am the very last person who wants to destroy this robot. But it didn't pass the test. It escaped out of the laboratory, doesn't communicate, and is erratic. That's why it's dangerous. He's my friend, and he can communicate. Right now he's in the park talking to Anton and Olga. That's nonsense. I'll believe that, when I see it. Okay. Come on. I'll bring you to him. But only if you promise not to tell anyone and not to hurt him. I won't hurt him. I promise. CHECK IN OUT ON "LIST" Didn't your parents teach you to ask who's there? Hmm? Anton Semjonow. You go to School 720, Classe 2C. Today you became famous. Who are you? One of your new followers. Where's the robot? Now you look cool. Before your look was kind of boring. Asymmetric. But rather colorful. Could this be considered art, huh? Probably not to everyone's taste. No, I don't think so. Splendid. I think this probably means "attractive". Is Mitja splendid? Now that's hard to say. He's so different, and a dreamer. Huh. And what is a "dreamer"? Someone who has a robot as their best friend. A112. Hello Viktor, how are you? We are currently busy making art of questionable taste. Mitja, when are we going to Vologda? I am ready. That's enough. Stop. No one is going to Vologda, got it? And why are we standing outside when it's raining? So now I'm going to take you all home with me, and then we'll drink some tea, and have a chat. A112, I'm ordering you to follow me. Friends do not order friends. And my name is Robo. Dearest Viktor, Ro-bo. I'm sorry, Robo. Attention! Danger! We have been discovered. Did you call them? No, I didn't do it. Viktor Aleksandrovitch, you and the children get away from the robot. We will fire electromagnetic bullets and deactivate the object. Beat it! - Come on, Robo. - Hurry. Situation analysis: danger! No exit route for Robo. Danger for Robo. I am asking you to get out of the way. We just want to deactivate him. Listen to me, you don't wanna do this. - No, don't. - It's a mistake. He has optimized and solved the problem by himself. You leave Robo alone. Then I will have to use force. The use of force is a sign of an inadequate ability to communicate. - Fire when ready. - Yes, sir! Understood. Viktor, take Mitja and Olga away from here. - It is too dangerous. - I'm afraid. Detecting danger for humans. All humans leave the danger zone. All humans leave the danger zone! Source of danger is too difficult to control. All humans must leave the danger zone. Get the kids out of here. Situation is no longer under control. Robo! Robo! Damage from danger source irreparable. Robo! Robo! - Stay here! Mitja! - Robo! Robo! - Come back! - Robo! Robo! Get off! Get off of me! He needs me! Robo! I didn't expect that from your machine. He died like a human, trying to save and protect his family. Mitja. Mitja, don't go over there. Robo is really dead, isn't he? We should go now. - Mitja, come. - He was my only friend. Let's go home. Mitja... my... friend. - You're alive. - I think... - I'm so happy. - I need... a... vacation. - Yes, my friend. - Viktor. You have most certainly earned one. Robo, you saved us. Thank you. That is how I was conceived. - Universal... Rescue Robot... - Exactly. A112. Friends call me Robo. And don't worry, we'll get you up and running again. Yes, my darling. Sure, of course. We'll be home real soon, yes. Have a look at this, would you? I'll take a look at it. Thank you. Yo. Oh and here I am at the circus. They caught me while I was looking for clothes for Robo. And when we won the robot competition? No. I haven't had the time to draw that. You cannot draw something that hasn't happened yet. Okay. Put away the comics. Lunch is ready. Careful. I'd like to make a photo of us all. Robo, would you get my phone please? With pleasure. - It looks great. - A family photo. That is cool. Don't forget, my name is... Robo. And I am simply perfect.
