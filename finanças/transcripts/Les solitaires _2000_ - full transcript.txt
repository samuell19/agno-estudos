No, turn round. THE LONELY You're crying, sweetheart. Stop. Stop it. Madeleine. I'm here. I'm here. Another nightmare. I can't sleep afterwards. I think. About me? All day and night. All the time. It bothers me. I know. I'm messing up your life. It's lasted for too long. A year. It's time it stopped, isn't it? I wanted to meet up with you once. But I didn't dare. I didn't go all the way. Don't do that, silly. I know it's silly. We can meet up when you like. But you have to live your life. And forget me a bit. Understand? It's too hard. I miss you too much. I want you to be here like before. To touch you like before. You know we can't. I'm dead... and you're alive. We're from different worlds. Funny thing to say, isn't it? Yes. I'll be with you one day. There's no hurry. I'm here. Waiting for you. Make the most of life first. OK? Yes. You say yes but I know that means no. I swear I want to think yes, but it's difficult. Now close your eyes and go to sleep. - Already? - Yes. I'll be back. You have to sleep. Shall I take a sleeping pill? If you like. Baptiste... Pierre, it's me. - What do you want? - It's been a while. It's late, isn't it? - 10 o'clock. Is it too late? - I go to bed early. You still haven't got a phone. I've just got here. I've a job interview tomorrow. I thought I could stay here. So we can see each other. We're brothers and never see each other. I've got a single bed. I can sleep on the floor. Can I kiss you? If you like. I'm pleased. Can I come in? It's modest. Eva says hello. Still married, then? Surprised, hey? I've changed. I've become faithful. I was going to sleep. We can talk tomorrow. Pierre? Yes? I'm pleased to see you. Me too. Good night. Night, Pierre. Are you all right? Poor Pierre, the nights you spend. It all comes back to me. The car going off the road, Madeleine shouting "break". It's so clear. Stop it. It's terrible. - I killed her. - Shut up. I'd like to be dead too. I'd like to be with her. To have the strength. Shut up. I don't want to find you half-dead again. I just have to do it right. Enough! Don't start such talk with me. I'm taking care of you. I don't want to hear it. Or I'll clear off and you'll manage alone. I'm already alone. Thanks. Nice for the friends. I have to go. Leave it. I'll do it. This has just come out. The Magnificat makes me cry every time. - Alice... - What? Sorry. I don't believe your excuses. Really, I'm sorry. I don't know who I am for you. At times, I don't think I'm much. But you're hurting me. That's it. Sorry. I need you Alice. Believe me. Am I bothering you? Your brother's not nice to me. He's giving me a hard time. Do something. I think he's sinister. And noisy at night. Sinister, me? You idiot! At least you're direct. Are you nuts? You shame me. Get dressed. Do you mind, Alice? It was friendly. No, I'm glad to be your friend. See, it wasn't spiteful. She's not angry. It was very funny. I'm off to the radio station. Come round tonight. I've friends coming. With pleasure. And you, Pierre? Thanks for the mattress. It's a bit narrow, but should do for a night. I'll just feel a bit lonely. Your eyes bulge out when you say that. Do you realise? Bye. See you tonight. Still the same lout. And stupid too. - You dramatise everything. - No I don't! Alice found it nice. She's more delicate than you think. I'm late for my meeting. Clear your stuff up! You make a right mess! Look, I'm late. Clear your mess up! You never wanted to learn. Now it's caught up with you. Look... Come here. Come on, Pierre. Do as I do. There you go. I want to make love. - It's impossible. - Why? You know why. My body isn't my body. Madeleine... I love you so much. It's too painful. Come here. Come on. Please. Don't be afraid. Can I undress you? Wait. Don't you want to? I'm very shy. Let me kiss you then. Just once. I'd love to kiss you. Wait. Why? It's been so long. Really? Yes. I work a lot. I don't go out. I'm all alone here. Do you like me? Yes. Let me kiss you then. I'm very sensitive. I'll be very gentle. Can I open my eyes? Come here. Nearly finished? That's disgusting! Not the outside loo! Stop it! Stop that! - Let me go! - Stop it! What's wrong? What's going on? Have I hurt you? Tell me. Baptiste, what's wrong? I didn't have an interview. You didn't? It doesn't matter. You'll have others. It's not that. What is it then? Start at the beginning. You didn't have an interview. So why did you come here? I didn't know where to go. It's been 3 weeks... Why? Eva's left me. She was right. I'm a real jerk. I don't do anything with my life. I cheat on my wife. So she had enough of this jerk. She threw me out. She was right. But I'm so sad now. I'm trying to beat it, but can't. It's all going wrong. I'm a real jerk. I'm lost. - You're not a jerk. - Yes I am. Not if I say so. Don't take the trouble. Got anything to drink? I feel like a drink. I haven't cried since Eva left me. I needed to. I feel better. It's always a relief. Just be careful afterwards. Don't worry. I'm fine now. It's weird. I've never seen you cry. It's true, it's not my style. Yours, yes. What do you mean? I know you. I saw you cry as a kid. Floods of tears. Pour me another whisky. When we were kids, maybe... But now... Maybe you're right. I don't like being a crybaby. Horrible, isn't it? I love you as you are. - Really? - Of course. It's weird. I thought you didn't love me. What an idea? I don't know. You used to hit me as a kid. - It was proof of my love. - A bit strange! You know I've always been impulsive. But I love you. I swear. Pour me another one, please. I don't know what'll happen. I'm not used to drinking. Me neither. Why are you laughing? I'm happy to see you. Yes, it's nice. I love you too. Oh yeah! You had doubts? You were always closed off. You never said anything. You're right. But we had good times together. We've broken everything. I don't care. I've had enough of this place and my life. - Do you believe me? - Yes. I haven't been out for weeks. I've a cloistered life. Alice feeds me. Disgusting, hey? Disgusting! I'm fed up of this dump. Ghosts and nightmares... I don't want to see Madeleine. Madeleine, your wife? But she's dead. - And her ghost? - You're mad. You don't believe in ghosts? You have to be a fool. You're right. No more ghosts. Now it's life for real. Getting out to work. Being independent. Me too. We'll both be independent. Give me the bottle. It's nice to see you again. Just like before, hey? I feel like we're kids again. Yeah. We'll start from scratch. Grow up together. Do great things. Be strong. Not leave each other, OK? OK. What's wrong? Aren't you happy any more? - I thought of a stupid thing. - What? It's stupid. We have to be honest with each other. You're right. Well? - It was a woman just now. - What do you mean? A mathematician. She said I kissed badly. You kissed a mathematician? Yes. So say, I kiss badly. I'm useless with women. - She just wanted to hurt you. - You reckon? Of course. Some women are cruel. She was one. Can I kiss you? To check. So you can tell me. If you like. Well? It's fine. Normal. And if I put my tongue in? It's nice. What I like is this. Lip biting. Not bad. I'll do it. Do you know this? No. It's nice. I'll remember that. So do I kiss well? Of course you do! The bitch just wanted to hurt you. You can't know how that reassures me. Shit! Who's that? Pierre... Baptiste! It's Alice. Open the door. - She's in love with me. - Did she say? Of course. It's my territory. - Have you made love? - Not yet. Don't go any further with her. Look, I really like her. Leave her to choose. All right, but take it steady. Great. Come and party with us. You look strange. - Are you coming? - No, we'll party here. Come in! Come in! We're having the party here! We're having the party here! It's bigger! I'm happy. I can see. It makes a change. It's nice. I've never been so happy. I can be as funny as Baptiste, can't l? Am I as good as he is? Of course, Pierre. Don't act the innocent. I can read your game. You hurt him. No, he's as solid as a rock. You're heavy. Never mind. Women say they like my heavy body. I'm a woman with few muscles. So I'd like you to keep on your feet. No, hold me up. I like you. You're not the same person today. - Seeing me in double? - No joke. I can see you. I like you. I can see you. So you can see me. This is a declaration. Don't you like it? I want to kiss you. This is a declaration and you stay cold. I've had so many. I believed them. It's not the same. It's my declaration. I'm stopping to be naive. It's true what I'm saying. I like you talking to me that way. I want to say the same thing. I want to kiss you too. But we're very drunk. What'll happen tomorrow? It'll all go up in smoke. Open your eyes. I've decided to change. Tomorrow will be another life. And I want it to be with you. We'll see. Exhibitionist! You're hysterical! On the isle of Cythera This lovely stay Is a lonely place Guided by love Each for their own Sings their pleasure And as a sacrifice Comes to offer their sighs In this retreat You spend wonderful days And the secret nights Are even better What a lovely residence Full of charm We see each other all the time And never stop loving each other In that place, no strict rule Shortens the days The vow you have to take Is to always love If you wanted to, Alice It would make me happy Come and spend your life here Let's take our vows You're in! Eva! I've looked everywhere. Love... Funny, isn't he? It was Sunday. Mum made him laugh. He'd just drawn me. Grown up, hasn't he? - You OK? - I've got a hangover. - Want anything? - Some peace. Be kind, will you? Forget it. He's got a hangover. We'll be discreet. We won't bother you. I'm pleased to see you. It's been a while. He got paint all over him. I think he's gifted. I don't feel well. What's wrong? I'm sorry. Calm down, Eva. Stay here. You came for him. Go all the way. He was unfaithful, but you, what did you give? Nothing. You're cold. You never give anything. You're too afraid. Afraid of everything. Even your kid. Look at yourself. You want to be loved, but never give anything back. Go on... Take your man back. He's waiting for you. Go on. OK? Is everything OK? Pierre, please leave us alone. Sorry? I want to be with Eva. Go with Alice. No way. This is my home. I'm staying. Don't talk about it. I want to be with Eva. I thought we were sticking together. Don't be stupid. Leave us alone. No way! Fuck off! Stop it! Why did you do that? He's your brother! He's a nuisance. A pain in the neck! We could've gone somewhere. Why stay here? I want you. I can't help myself. I can't wait. You don't change. What will Pierre do? Go to Alice's place. She's his lover. She'll take care of him. Don't worry. You OK? Did you like it? Eva, did you like it? Yes. Really? I liked it too. Not in English! I don't understand! Do it with your pupils, not with me. You were looking for it. I love you, I love you... I heard you. Me too, me too... How are you? Answer me. We'll get a doctor. I don't want one. Don't be silly. You're ill. I forbid you. I forbid you. No doctors. Nice one. What do we do? Nothing. Just leave me like this. Didn't you want that? So get out! I'm not abandoning you. I'm off to Besancon. We'll see each other soon. Often... Go to Besancon with your wife and kid! Leave! I want you to leave! Leave! I want you to leave! Calm down. Leave! Don't worry. It's just overwork. Goodbye. Goodbye, doctor. What's wrong with him? He's unbearable. He was always a crybaby. Anyway, you're dear to him. He's dear to me too. That's not the question. You both scare me a bit. Scare you? Why? I don't know. I don't feel at ease here. How long are we staying? We're leaving soon. Don't worry. Baptiste... Everything will be fine. Don't worry. Are you OK? Feeling better? Answer me. You're worrying us. Your brother wants to leave. You shouldn't sulk. You ought to let him leave. His kid's expecting him. Are you listening? Don't let yourself go. Hang on. To what? To life. You were happy at the party. You saw it's possible to live. That it's beautiful. It was fake. All of it was. What are you saying? What you told me was fake? I was glad to come yesterday and I don't know why... I got scared and didn't come in. I think I felt things had changed. I don't know any more. I'm lost. I want to die. Don't start that again. I want to die. I'm hurting too much. I'm fed up with life. You can't say that. I'm here with you. Are you listening to me? I'm here. With you. You're killing me. Pierre, you're killing me. Sure you don't want to stay? Eva's working tomorrow. We'll drive at night. It'll be faster. OK. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Don't say sorry. I hate making a show of myself. I'm ashamed. Sorry. The main thing is you feel better. I'm glad you're back together. You're so beautiful. You go well together. You find us beautiful? We all look tired. No, we're all beautiful. Speak for yourself. Want some rice? Yes please. I'm hungry. It's really good. Thanks. It's an English recipe. Really? I thought you ate badly there. No more than elsewhere. There are good things. Don't listen to Eva. She loves everything English. Not at all. If you went to England, you'd see. Why not? Let's go on a trip. Lets' all go to England. Do you fancy it? A little English holiday... Alice? Yeah, I've never been there. Would you like to? When I'm feeling better. I don't know it either. I could perfect my English. - Do you speak English? - I'm starting. What are you saying? - You don't believe me? - Prove it. Not bad. Carry on. Put your tongue between your teeth and blow. It bothers me a bit. Are you sure you're fine? Yes. Don't worry. It was nothing. Alice will take care of me. She's my guardian angel. - Let's meet up soon. - I intend to. Bye, Pierre. Bye, Baptiste. Bye, Eva. Bye, Pierre. Bye, Alice. Drive carefully. Be careful. Won't you wave bye? I'm tired. Was I OK? Funny question. You were perfect. - I'd like a cigarette. - A cigarette? It's been so long. I've forgotten the taste. Just one then. I'm taking care of you, me, your health... I'm really tired. Try to get a good night's sleep. I'll try. Without moving about. No nightmares, no talking. That's more difficult. It's not working. Do you know what I'd like? Tell me. Get Michel to sing to me so as to help me to sleep. If he's at home, he won't refuse. He's so kind. That would be great. Music reassures me. Sleep frightens me, I think. I'll go and get him. Alice... You really take care of me. Don't I just? Thanks. Madeleine... You're here. What's up? Are you sad? What's wrong? Answer me. Pierre... I missed you. I suffered so much. I thought I'd lost you. I looked for you too. I cried. I cried so much! It's finished now. We're together again. I miss you. I miss you too. I can't bear it. I can't live like this. It's too long without you. I'll join you... now. Come... Come, my love. I've waited so long. My love... I'm happy. Come on. I'm coming. Pierre, are you asleep? Pierre. Say something. Bye, Pierre. FlVE YEARS LATER Shallots too? No, it kills the taste. It's an hour's cooking, isn't it? Sometimes longer. You taste it. Your dad doesn't like it over-cooked. But do as you like. I'll see. Hi, Baptiste. Worked hard? Yeah, I'm tired. I won't be up late. My parents are eating with us. Great. Good evening. Want a biscuit? Hi, Stephane. Hi, dad. Baptiste, are you asleep? You're next to the man you love. You love him. It's Baptiste. He loves you too. You're happy now. You know what love is. You haven't lived for nothing. It's all quiet. Your child's asleep. Your husband too. Next to you. You can sleep now. Sleep, Eva. Sleep. Subtitles: R. J. McCarthy Processed by C.M.C. - Paris
