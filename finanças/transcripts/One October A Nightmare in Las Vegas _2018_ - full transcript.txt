You know that he was up there in that room, looking through that scope, watching us do that. - We actually were having so much fun before everything happened, and then horror, terror, blood, screams. Run! - It is a three-day festival. Top country artists that come in and play, it runs from like four to eleven, or midnight. - Real cross-section of people there, young, old, seemed all races. - This is the first time I had gone. The venue was wonderful. And just to be with my friends. - And it was kids and children and you know, everybody was there, it's a family event. - It was a night without our kids and you know, it was kinda like our first date again, so. - Well, I was working. It was a great day, great music. I mean, nobody arguing, everybody's having a good time. - You had worked all weekend this concert? - No, that's the funny thing. That was my night for that Sunday and the thing is they weren't gonna use me, because I had the wrong-colored tennis shoes. So they were like well just hold off and we'll see if we can use you. I'm like all right, so I just waited. So they almost sent you home? - One of the ladies, she was like, I can use some big guys. And she was like all right, go with her. I'm like all right and everybody goes like well, you must've been there for a reason. I'm like, I don't know. - It was our third day at the concert, so we went to the back. Probably the first time that we sat in the back to watch the concert. Usually we were up in the front, dancing, having a good time. It was Sunday night, we were flying out the next day, Jason Aldean was the last act. - Me and my husband had just gotten back from the stage. We went up to the stage and we'd gotten a drink at one of the bars that were up there. - It was getting late, it was about ten o'clock. And at one point I even thought about leaving, 'cause I was tired, it was the third day. But it was a beautiful night and Jason Aldean came out and things were rockin. - I was in the VIP area where we were working at. When the entertainer, Jason, came on, before the shooting I remember he asking where's all the veterans at? Where's all my soldiers in the crowd? Where's the police department? We need to quit being disrespectful to the flag and start saluting the flag. That's what he said. And when he said we're gonna sing this song for you, everybody raise your beer up and raise your lights up, that's why it was really, really dark at that time, because it was like a dedication kind of song. - I was over by concessions so I was about 100 yards from my main group, the other nine or 10 people that were with me. And I had just went over there for a beer and was kinda standing watching things from the side. And Jason Aldean I think started his second or third song. - And were heard a bunch of noise and it sounded like fireworks. I said wow that's weird that fireworks would be going off as he's actually singing a song. - But I knew right away that they were gunshots and I told him those are gunshots. - She knew right away that they were gunshots and I was what you call a deer in the headlights. I was lost and I didn't believe it. I was like no, that's not gunshots. - I was sitting next to my friend, Jerry, he said those aren't fireworks, those are gun rounds. And he said they're coming from over there and he pointed over towards the strip. And I thought oh, it's probably gang-related, the police are gonna take care of it. - I looked at my husband and I grabbed his hand and I asked him what drunk idiot would set off a brick of firecrackers in a crowd of people? And my husband, I'll never forget the look on his face, because it was like he knew it wasn't firecrackers or fireworks. - We were all just kinda looking around like who the heck is doing fireworks right now? And we're like okay, where are the fireworks? 'cause you expect to see something in the air by that point. And we're looking up like okay, what the heck is that? - My thoughts were it was just a confrontation out on Tropicana Boulevard. And then the concert resumed. - Jason Aldean paused for a second and the music, you could tell they missed their chords, but then he started back up and people seemed to be fine. So I thought maybe a speaker was acting weird. - We heard like six shots first, different caliber. And then we're looking up, nothing, then all of a sudden another caliber came out all with a ping sound. I'm like no, that's not fireworks, that's a gun. - We knew something was going on, but we were just not reacting quite yet. Then once Jason Aldean ran off stage, we kinda really knew something was really serious. - I looked back at my friend and our other friend had already said that that's gunshots. It was like her face was just it was just her eyes were teared up and I knew that it was bad. - And then I could see the crowds starting to move. They were moving towards me, because the crowd was between me and Mandalay. So at that point I knew it was gunfire. - What I saw was basically the front of the stage getting shot up pretty good. The screens where they showed the video of the concert going on so people in the back can see what actually the artist is doing, was getting shot up on the right-hand side. - I was staring at, I guess he was on duty officer, but he was in the vest, I saw him draw his gun, duck down, and start running straight towards Mandalay Bay. And I was like what the heck is going on? It felt like it was slow motion. I looked over to the right at the rest of the lounge and it was one of the guys, he was wearing like the village t-shirts like he was one of the volunteers, it's almost like he made eye contact with all of us at the same time and he was like those are gunshots, get down. Get down, everybody get down. And that's like when it all hit us. - After three, four minutes went by, that's when it hit me. No, this could be a terrorist attack. Like I say, we didn't know where it's coming from. But it sounded very close. And I was calling my daughter and leaving them a video in case something happen. We don't know what's going on, but somebody is shooting at this event that I'm working at. And we don't know who or is it a terrorist attack or what? But just in case I don't make it out, I just want you to know I love you. - We thought there were multiple shooters the way that it sounded, the difference from the first volley to the second volley. I can't explain it, but it sounded differently than the firecracker round, first round that went off. And we started to run not knowing where we were gonna exit, because the only exit we knew of was the main entrance and exit. - Were more people running or hiding? - None of us expected it to be coming from 32 stories up, we thought at ground level. So I think that most people got down to try to avoid the gunfire that way. - I witnessed my best friend, Natalie Grumet, being shot in the face. - I saw Natalie get shot and Natalie's blood all over me. And then hearing my sister scream I'm shot, I'm shot. She was bleeding all over the place. She kept saying my side. I'm shot in my side and I was like no, you're not, 'cause there was no blood, the bullet had lodged. So there was no blood, it was stuck. Thank god the bullet didn't go any further or come out 'cause that could have been a very worse-case scenario. You shielded your body to protect your wife. - It was just natural instinct I think when you love and you care for somebody so much. - We were on the floor and he put his body on top of me. I just told him I don't care if it's not gunshots, I just wanna leave now. I don't wanna be here anymore. And he said okay. And he got up and the moment he got up is when he got shot. - I got struck in my back left armpit and it shot out the front of my chest. I got really mad and angry and I cursed 'cause I knew somebody shot me. And I was just screaming at whoever it was, I didn't know who it was, but I just knew I was shot. - I was in shock. I couldn't move anymore. He was trying to get me to like talk to him and I couldn't. He just grabbed my hand and he just told me I got shot, I need you to run and don't stop running. And I couldn't move. I didn't even respond to him. An he's like are you listening to me? I need you to run. - It was a nightmare. We were at a war and it just felt like it's people after us right now. Hey there's some guy right up there, you see him? I don't know. - Our group said to get down, but the seats were so small. They were like little tiny stadium seating, they were very small, so getting down meant just, I mean what are you gonna do? You're still exposed. I mean I had 11 friends and I was alone, I didn't know where anybody was. I sent out a text to my family. We have a group family text, there's like 25 of us on it, and I just said shots fired, I loved you. I'm sorry. The guns were just, the noise, it sounded like a machine gun. And it just wouldn't stop. And it started to hit the bleachers and ricochet off and I just laid down on the ground and just like I knew it was gonna hit me. For some reason I just felt like it was gonna hit my back. And I didn't think it was fair 'cause I just had a grandchild. - Everything was going through our heads, but at the same time we're having that moment where it's just like, we're gonna die. We're gonna die tonight. Luckily, there was a good amount of space in between the bleachers. But we were practically laying on top of each other, like everybody who was in that row. I'm looking down and I see a lady who had been shot on her abdomen on the left side and she was laying like flat on her back. She was alone and I couldn't reach her. We were six to eight feet elevated from the ground and she was laying on the ground. And I couldn't see if she was okay, I couldn't tell if she was dead or alive, breathing or anything. I couldn't even call out to her. I just stared at her. I just remember seeing her laying there and thinking wow, there's literally like gunshots flying all over us. Shots fired at the fucking concert. My daughter. Where the fuck is that coming from? - I was on the west side of the concert. So I was closest to where the gunman was shooting. His exact location I did not know. And that's a very fearful thing, because you don't know, nobody knows where the gunfire is coming from. Did you see anybody get shot? - Yes, a lot of people got down on the ground. And so it was hard to tell who was shot and who was just on the ground for cover. It's a feeling of helplessness. No matter what you do or where you run, you don't know if you're gonna get hit. There was no point of safety. - I had no idea where any firing was coming from. In fact, even when I got behind the bleachers, I didn't know if there was a shooter up front walking our way. I didn't know what was going on. - And we just kept going until we made it over to the front of the stage. And then we hid in between two speaker boxes with gunshot just firing the whole time. - I had tied a tourniquet with my flannel and my sister's headband around my arm. And so I had tried to stop the bleeding as much as I could. And while we were running, that's when I started to feel that my body was losing control of its self for a minute. - We made it under the stage and that's when we had a brief minute. She was able to call her husband and call my husband and say our goodbyes to our family. 'cause we thought that was goodbye. - Very chaotic scene. People running, people screaming, some huddled around people that had already fallen. Is there one moment that you will never forget? - Is when I was holding my friend's hand and I saw a body in blood laying there and I had to jump over. And there was nothing I could do to help, because your first mind was to just run. And it's a lot of guilt, because the guilt come from we wish, well I can't say for everybody, but for me, I wish I could turn back around and help more people. You think it was better for people to run or hide? - Definitely run. But like I said, we didn't know where it was coming from. But coming from the outside looking in, laying down just made it worse. Because the way the lights came on at the concert, when he start shootin’ the lights came on. Where now you can see the target just laying down like that. - Some people criticize that, 'cause if the lights are on, then he can have a clearer look on who to shoot at. - Right, but I guess they were trying to figure out with the lights coming on maybe where this person is shooting at or they can see better. I don't know. - It's like a total war zone. I'm like what is going on here? Then I see a lot of people running around like not knowing where to go. So I open the gate and everybody came out. - There was really no safe place in the venue to go. - My husband and I were able to stay together. We were running and we got over probably two or three fences and I heard someone crying and screaming my name hysterically. And I looked to my left and about 30 yards away was my best friend. She had been separated from her husband, and were all in a large group, like I said about 15, we'd all been separated and my friend was running by herself. And the look of panic and fear and terror on her face. Get down. Those are shots. Those are shots. Run. Those are shots. Run. Don't look. Run. Go. Go. Go. Everybody go. Go. Run. Keep your head down. Go. Keep your head down. Go. Run, keep your head down. - I covered my wound and grabbed Kimberly and we ran. - At the moment that we started running, everybody started running. Keep your head down. Run. Go. Keep your head down. Go, you guys go. Go. Go. Run, run, run, run. Are you fucking shitting me? Let's go, get up. Get up. Run. Get up on your feet. On your feet. Let's go. One of you can certainly help me. - Here. - Thank you. Get down. - This lady started following us and she, she got hit in the face by a bullet and she fell. Her lifeless body just fell. And that's when I started talking now. Basically me seeing her die, it woke me up. - So I rounded the corner and it just kept getting closer. And right at the base of the bleachers there were two girls, they were laying down, I didn't know if they were hurt. So I jumped over them, which is maybe four seats in front of my wife and friends, 'cause by then the noise was so close I just knew it was, so I jumped over them and laid there. And I remember thinking just if I get hit, make it be not a major organ. And then I could hear the bullets hit the metallic bleachers. Tink, tink, tink, six or eight of them bounced up and then the shooting stopped. So I got off of the two girls, I asked them if they were all right. And they said yeah, what do we do? What do we do? - We ran into Losers tent, everybody was in there hiding behind the bar, the gunfire still going off. Then my boyfriend's a sergeant with Metro, we were there, he wasn't working, pulled out his badge and he's telling everybody in the tent when the gunfire stopped that time that we had to get out of there. That bar wasn't gonna stop the bullets and if he shot into that tent, we were all dead. So I'm calling 9-1-1, I can't get through, I can't get through. So I threw a post of Facebook real quick saying shots fired from Mandalay Bay. How were able to know that, that it was coming from Mandalay Bay? - Because I saw that blinking light on the tenth floor. Well which was actually the sixth floor, because I didn't count the bottom. But the shots came from the 32nd floor, so? - I know, but it was explained later it was either a strobe light or a reflection. But it was just weird. When that second series came out, I happened to be looking at Mandalay Bay. And so as it was firing it was like. And that like was going. So I whole-heartedly believed and that's why I said I posted on Facebook. I mean I have 1,200 friends and I'm like somebody will see it, tell the police where it's coming from 'cause I couldn't get through to 9-1-1. - I never go to the Mandalay Bay. Never, never at that time. At that time at ten o'clock at night and I just happened to drop off from the airport across the way and I came over and I thought let's see what's goin on. And I wanted to look at something on Facebook so I'm sitting there looking on Facebook and then we were moved up just one or two cars. So there I was still sitting there at the Mandalay Bay when I should've gone back to the airport. Something's going on. And all the taxi drivers, we're just doing whatever. Just you know sitting there. It wasn't very busy that night so we were just minding our own business, waiting for us to keep moving up in the taxi line. I just thought it was jackhammering. And yeah, they do have jackhammering at night because it's warm. For there being gunfire, sure doesn't seem like people are running. Shit. Seriously, I don't know what's going on. Never in the front of my mind, the back of my mind, anywhere, never did I think that it was somebody shooting and killing people across the street at a festival. Where are the cops at? I'm right here by the porch at Mandalay Bay and everything just seems to be normal here. But I finally did pull out of line, even though the other taxi cabs were already there, went underneath where the valet is and everybody's just standing around. Some dude sitting there smoking a cigarette. Do not go to Mandalay Bay. Stay away from there. - All right, I'm leaving. This is ridiculous. I don't know why people aren't leaving. This is insane. Everybody is just standing around. It doesn't seem like anybody's moving. It seems like it's coming from... Shots fired. They don't even know the details yet. I just talked to Metro here at the airport. They're still getting the details. - Just people standing around. There's multiple injuries and... You guys, there's shots fired. That's all they're telling me. They're not telling me anything other than that. They just said stay away from there. They're shutting the whole place down. All right this is crazy, I don't know. So the night goes on and I saw that you picked up a lot of people. - I did. Yeah, I picked up five people and they all crammed in the back of my cab. Shooting at the festival across from the Mandalay Bay. Please try to stay away. So now you got people running. You got people climbing over the fence there. Peter said it was across the street at the festival by Mandalay Bay where they have that festival going on. Yeah, you got people climbing over the fence here at the festival and people running around. Broken leg, broken leg. Broken leg. What happened? Is there somebody out there? Go. Go. All right. Oh god, there is an after shooter. Okay. So many people are dead. Are you kidding me? No, we're not. Go. Go. Go. Close the door. Close the door. We're trying to. Close the door. I'm trying to. Is everybody in? Okay, all right. I'm going, I'm going. Oh shit. Please drive as fast as you can. I am. Where are we going? The first two people that got in they said broken leg, broken leg. She's got a broken leg. I said okay, get in. Where you wanna go? And they're all just drive, drive. And then I guess all these other people started, three other people got in, and they're like go, go, go, go. And they were just scared out of their minds. No, I'm not going anywhere near the Luxor. Can you take us far away? Get the fuck out of Vegas. Oh my god. Just keep driving out of town. Seriously, thousands of people are dead. Everybody's bloody. You're kidding. No, swear to God. No joke, just drive. I'm driving. There are people in the street. All right. Get out of the way. Good lord. Okay. Drive faster. All right, I'm going. - Please. - Drive faster. All right. Yeah, this is a really serious situation. I've got a bunch of people in my cab from that festival. Everybody's shot, thousands. Thousands are shot, all right. Okay, I'm going. We're going, we're getting out of here. - We live literally probably five miles away and actually I can see the strip from my house and I could see helicopters flying in that general direction. You hear cop cars, you hear ambulances. It was just chaos, utter chaos. And we received a phone call from one of our employees that shots were fired on the strip. We turn on the news, nothing had happened yet, nothing was said. Went to social media, on Facebook, and we noticed some posts of saying shots fired, gunshots heard at Mandalay Bay. Then proceeded to check my wife's phone who has closed circuit cameras of her galleries that she works at. And pulled up the Mandalay Bay Gallery and we noticed people running down the hallway, people running into the store hiding behind desks. - That night I was working in the casino in a store there. Then one of my other co-workers calls me up to let me know that there's a shooting going on across the street. So I'm on the phone with him now and I think he's playing a prank on me. I'm like I know you're playing with me, man. He's like no, I wouldn't joke with you about something like this. So I go to the computer and I start to look it up. I'm looking up the Route 91 Festival and what's goin go and there's nothing on it 'cause it's happening right now. So then I get a customer come in and start asking me questions and it takes my mind off of it for a second. Two more people come in and they say hey, there's an active shooter going on, we have to hide. So my instinct was to rush the people that are in the store, there's four people and then me, so five people total, I rush us all out through the back of the store into the storage room that is back behind the shops. - I was standing on Las Vegas Boulevard and there's two officers standing about 10 feet from me and so I looked at them, I said that's gunfire, right? And so they started walking towards Mandalay Bay and I started walking that way also. And so I just grabbed my phone and just kinda held it up. Do you want me to take care of this and you go there? I just need bandages, man. Four by fours or gauze. Shit. Medical, they're not gonna come while shots are still being fired. You're gonna be all right. - What is going on right now? - A lot of people were coming out of this one exit, so I was helping to direct them to go the right direction. Keep your head down, run this way. Keep your head down. Run this way. Keep your head down. Run that way. Keep your head down. Run this way. Keep your head down. Run that way. And there was some people that were huddled by the fence and I was just trying to tell them you'd be safer to go. You need to run that way, you'd be a lot safer. - Which way? - Run that way. Go while they're not shooting. Go. There was a pretty good amount of time in between when he was shooting and when he wasn't shooting. We're trying to just get the people to move when it wasn't, when the fire wasn't happening. The one gentleman asked for help, he said he'd been shot. And so I walk him back over to the safe area. I need help. What's wrong? I've been shot in the arm. You've been shot? - I need 9-1-1. I need an ambulance. Okay, here. Try and keep your head down, go this way. You have a tourniquet on? - Yeah, they put one on me. Stay low, go left. - I need an ambulance. There ain't nobody here to help us. Where are the ambulances? You okay? No. I need an ambulance. I've been shot. Get down. Get down. There's a guy shooting from the Mandalay Bay. He's been shot. Do we have medical setup somewhere yet? - Take them east. They're not gonna come this way, take them east. Come on this side of the wall, come this way. Stay right here. He's been shot. Just relax. Relax, relax. You okay, you okay? Keep it above your heart. Yeah, hold it up. Hold it above your heart. Is that fucking tight enough? Tourniquet? - He's got a tourniquet. Someone let me see that shirt. He's got one on it. Put some pressure on it. You got in the elbow? No, my forearm. My gut hurts though. Did you get shot in the gut? Does somebody have a flashlight? I need to get this tight enough. Ah it's tight. No, it's not. He's got one in his chest too. You got in the upper ribcage, chest. I do got one? Yes. It probably went through your arm and then went through the ribcage. - I'm medical, stop. Turn that light off. Put this on his chest. The chest ain't gonna do it, it's a chest wound. It ain't gonna fuckin do nothin’, but this is gonna stop this bleeding on his arm. Hey, look at me. What's your name, bro? - Doug. - Doug, I'm sergeant Layton, I'm Las Vegas Metro, Okay? Relax, we've got you. - I'm trying. - I'm off duty cop, just look at me. - I don't care. I want help. I want an ambulance. I'll go try and find medical. I'll be right back. And I went and got my truck and came back to get him and anyone else who was in the area. So I loaded up I think six or seven people in the truck. We got shot. Can we put him in your car? Yeah, let's bring him here. I'll take him to the hospital. Okay, let's get him in the truck. I'll take him to metro. Bring the guy with the chest. And one there. Right here, come in here. Come in on this side, Right here. Do we have any other wounded people you can take? - Not right now. Okay, let's go. The quiet of being in the truck, it was just silent. I think I even said out loud now what am I gonna do with these people? As I saw the ambulances over on the other side of the street I just made a u-turn to where all the medics were. I got five wounded. Ease me up. One second, man. We have one critical with gunshot wound to the chest here. Someone help me, please. Please, I'm bleeding so much, man. Sit down, sit down. Sit down. Were you afraid while you were filming that you may lose your life? - I didn't really think about it at all. It was kinda just I said before, it was almost like I felt like I was in a movie. It was almost like I was just going through the motions. It wasn't until days after that it kinda sunk in. - And we stayed low and we went up the bleachers, we went through the lounge, we went down the stairs, and we kind of ended up on the field. And I remember looking at the field and couldn't tell you why I looked at the field, in some sense I wish I hadn't looked at the field, but all you saw was bodies and blood. - I was a paramedic for a long time, so I was fighting with trying to decide if my role was to go back and help or to help my friends get out. And one our best friend's wife grabbed me by the back of the shirt and I turned around, I didn't even notice she was there, and she said just please get me out of here. And at that point I decided to get her out. So we ended up going out and unfortunately when we got out of the concert venue, we were back on the street and could see the Mandalay Bay again. So we waited for a break in the shooting and took off down the street. And I remember looking to my right, there was a body laying by the police cars and that was like my first visual reality. Up until then I heard people getting hurt and knew people were getting hurt, but then I knew that it was really serious. - There was a lot of heroism, there was a lot of humanity. I saw it firsthand when I was able to get out onto the street. There at that time there were not many ambulances, if any at all. But there were people in regular automobiles and SVUs taking bodies, people, into their cars and taking them to hospitals. - I've never seen anything like it. It was amazing. It was amazing to see people running into that to help other people, complete strangers they didn't even know. - Strangers just making sure like when I fell, a guy just came from out of nowhere, picked me up, are you okay? - A lot of people ran under the stage, hiding. So we had to get flashlights and pull everybody out of there. Seeing people crying. I look and then I see another people carrying another barricade with a lady facedown and you could see the red bullet hole on her back and they were carrying her out like that. - For you to stick around and think of others rather than yourself, that says a lot about you. - Not for me to say. I just did what I could and there was times I would lay down in bed thinking what more could I have done? Maybe going around looking for more gates to open up, I don't know. - So you turned your Toyota Tacoma into a rescue car. - Inside of my vehicle was full, outside of my vehicle was full. - How many can you fit in there? - Realistically, six in the back of the truck, five in the front of the truck, but I'm telling you there was a lot more than that. Once we started loading we had plenty of people in there. I felt lost because it's such a small vehicle, I wished I had a bigger vehicle, I wish we could take everybody. You didn't wanna deny anybody. - There was a bullet hole in your car, when was that bullet fired at you and do you recall being shot at? - There's been a couple different ideas where that came from, my initial thought was that was ricochet and it came off the pavement. But it was interesting because I had a gentleman running to the vehicle that I ran into at the survival group later at a meetup group who identified himself as the person who ran to my vehicle and put a dent in my door just trying to get in, whatever else. And he said the time we were loading people he heard the gunshot and he recalls it hitting my truck then and there. I can't prove or deny that, nor do I need to, but he's very adamant that it happened while we were loading people in the back of the truck. - Is there one image from that night that will stick with you forever? - Absolutely. A very vibrant, beautiful young girl was delivered to me. I remember looking at her wanting to help her, get her to safety, and she was delivered in a wheelbarrow. And I'm looking at her just like we're gonna be okay, we're gonna get you there, and then somebody comes around the corner around my shoulder, looks at a friend of hers and said honey, how long she not been breathing? Hit me, hit me real hard. 'cause I had no clue. That moment there from everything that happened afterwards was just adrenaline going, just reacting. I was lost at that point. - The medic tent was full. I said to someone is there something I can do? I work in health care. And she said well maybe over there, if you go over there there's an ambulance over there. Maybe you can help over there. I just walked. I was alone. I don't know where anybody else was. So I walked over and there were people loading people onto the rails that they make the fence with, the metal rails. They loaded this guy that had been shot up onto this monster truck. And he was laying on this rail and they started to take off. So I kept walking, I got over to the ambulance, there was a young girl there. She was hyperventilating, she was kinda coming in and out of consciousness. Somebody said can you help her? And I started doing the sternal rub on her trying to keep her conscious. And she said my boyfriend, he's been shot, they took him away. I left him, he's all alone. I've gotta find him. I said okay, okay. I didn't cry, I was okay. I said okay, we gotta go somewhere where we can get you a ride to the hospital. Hey you guys, get down. Go that way. Get out of here. There's gunshots coming from over there. Go that way. Go that way. Go that way, go that way, go that way. They're shooting right at us, guys. Everybody stay down. Stay down. So when did you find out that the shooter was firing from the top of the Mandalay Bay? - When we went back to the room and we had the news on, early morning. We were in our hotel room 'cause we were bunkered down and we had all the lights off, all the doors locked. We didn't turn the TV on until later on 'cause we were kind of afraid, we didn't know what was going on. So you were just quiet? - We were quiet. Social media started going crazy at the same aspect, so when we were there they were saying it was an active shooter at the New York New York at the time. They were saying there were active shooters at the Tropicana, at Hooters. They were saying there were shooters all over the strip. So we had no idea what was going on. This was all on social media. Did you think you were gonna die that night? - I did, I did. In Tropicana I definitely started to feel pretty weak and I was just waiting for that light supposedly they say was gonna come. - We got to the backside of Tropicana and we went up the stairs and the turmoil didn't stop there. All of a sudden you see a group of people running out going there's a shooter inside Tropicana, run, run, run. And I'm just like at that point I looked at my husband, I was like you have got to be kidding me. And so we turned around with everybody else and came back down the stairs. And I remember seeing one of the security guards like on the bottom and he was holding the door open for people to run into the basement area. And I remember just looking at him and I was like is there a shooter inside the hotel? And he was like what? And I was like is there a shooter inside the hotel? They're all running out saying there's a shooter inside the hotel. And he was like no, there's no shooter inside the hotel. And I was like okay. I looked at my husband and I'm like we're going to our room. - Made it to the first floor, got in the room and I told everybody leave the lights off. We ended up with maybe six kids, I call them kids, 25, 20, 25 year olds that were scared to death hiding up there, so we brought them in our room and just sat in the dark below the windows for a couple of hours before we were brave enough to turn the TV on. These are complete strangers? - The kids were complete strangers. We were sharing phone chargers, we had like two phone chargers in the bathroom. So we were rotating them, because their parents were trying to get ahold of them. Did you take anyone else anywhere? - No, because well I was freaked out as it is, but they were saying on the radio, on my radio, okay, well they've closed off the strip, they closed off everything, you can't get near the strip. I just went back to my base, my taxi base. And it was so weird, Charlie. I've never shook like this. I was shaking, I was in shock I guess. It was the most surreal 18 minutes of my life. It really was. It's like it wasn't happening. It was like I was in a dream world. Tell us how you found out about the story. - I think I found out like a lot of people did that night. So my producer gives me the call, I immediately hop out of bed, put on whatever shirt I could find. - My editor had actually texted a group of our reporters hey, there's word that there's an active shooter at Mandalay Bay. I just kind of thought okay, well let's figure out if this is real or not. The second I realized that this was probably real, there was like a switch that went on inside of me. Going to something where you really don't know what's going on, grounded myself and I just went to the hospital. It was around 10:30, 11:00, by the time that we got these reports. Just got in my car and started driving. The highways were backed up already. Police were starting to shutdown exits. - So the strip's shutdown, freeway's shutdown, the only cars we seem to see on the road, on the freeway, were police cars. And it's just empty. You don't see emptiness on the strip on any day, let alone a weekend, let alone a weekend night. - The editor texted me and said to go to Sunrise Medical Center where some of the victims had been transported. So I got in my car, drove there. And that was a very heavy experience. There was discarded clothing in the front of the shopping center, there was a discarded bloody plaid shirt by the parking lot. That image has stuck with me. - And I went to, again, University Medical Center which is the only level one trauma center in Nevada. And because I knew that, I figured if this was serious, that most of the critical victims would be taken there. Stayed out of the way, I was around the corner from the trauma entrance. There was a trauma nurse that came out, I was kinda chatting with her for a little bit and her face was white and she just kept saying it's bad, it's bad, it's bad. I've worked here for 10 years, I've never seen anything like this, it's bad. - I think some of us might find some form of peace with just answers. It's not gonna change what happened, but I don't understand it. Why haven't videos been released? If MGM did everything they were supposed to do, why haven't they put it all out on the table? - Periodically we need to know that they're working on it. I can't just have you tell me that we're investigating it and that's it. I need to know well what are you investigating and what were your findings? I feel like we're being letdown and with that comes the we're being forgotten. - I do find myself at night looking at videos trying to find different perspectives of what went on. To see some of the other questions that people have out there that are not answered. There's a lot of things that they're changing as it goes on and it seems like they're trying to make the scenario work this way, because this is how we need to spin it. I'm not pushing the blame anywhere to anything, all I wanna know is why this happened. Why this guy took 58 people's lives for no reason, had so much arsenal up in a hotel room that nobody knew about. How does he drill holes in walls, setup surveillance for three days and nobody notice? Do you think about this every single day? - Every single hour of the day. It's hard. I try to think of the happy moments, but it won't go away. And I would just like answers. I would like to know what really happened. - The ER department has worked through the night to identify all the victims of Sunday evening's mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. We have identified all but three victims. We still have an active scene at the grounds near Mandalay Bay so we ask anyone to stay away from that area until further notice. The FBI is working diligently to clear that scene. So he gets shot and he calls it in right away and he gives the room number. And there was police inside the Mandalay Bay when it was called in by Jesus Campos, right when the rampage began. So armed security is there as well. I'll give them three minutes to get to the 32nd floor, especially when you hear that shots were fired. - Right. So then that shooting could've been interrupted right in the beginning stages. Police took at least 10 minutes to get to the killer's room. Do you have a problem with that? - You know that 10 minutes that they said he shot, seemed like an hour. I hope someone starts bringing it up again and talking about what really went on in Vegas, what really happened. 'cause like you said, the victims that died that day, they deserve it. They deserve to know why their loved ones were lost. - I just felt like they were being overly cautious. And I know that's easy for me to say because I didn't have to breach the room where he was. I just think that they could have done things faster. Metro dropped the ball and I feel bad saying that because... How so? - I think more people could have been saved. And now when I say dropping ball now, I think they should keep us more informed. I think that's why there's so many conspiracy theories. - Oh it's very troubling that it took so long for cops, for police officers to enter the room. Clearly the Mandalay Bay resorts and MGM resorts were not prepared. They didn't do what they needed to do to protect the innocent people. - For the amount of time that it took for him to take those lives, something should've been done. Somehow he could have been stopped. There should've been more cops up there. They knew where the room was, it took them awhile. It took them awhile to get the okay to go up to the floor. Why do you think they would need the okay when here is a guy that says shots were fired? - That I don't know. That I don't know. - There's a lot of information I do know, but it's an ongoing investigation. And when I say I do not know, I may know. But as you can imagine in a criminal investigation, we wanna ensure the continued safety of our community and that all those questions are answered. And I assure you this investigation is not ended. - What happened inside that hotel suite? That's what we want to know. What happened and how did it happen? How did they let this happen? - And they know. - They do know. And they're not telling us. - My name is Doug Poppa. I'm a former US Army military policeman, former police officer, deputy sheriff criminal investigator, and spent 20 years in the hotel casino industry in Las Vegas as director of security at two properties. Prior to that I was an investigator for the MGM Grand hotel. MGM Resorts International and the Las Vegas Metro Police Department Sheriff Lombardo to this date have not released one shred of evidence to back up anything that they have said on anything that they've comment to the press. What I did initial in my investigation when I did this, I timed from the first time they knew about shots fired and the first call that came in came from a police officer inside the concert venue. He calls in we have shots fired. I timed it from that point until the time the officers arrived on the 32nd floor and it was about 18 minutes later. Now when they arrive on the 32nd floor, the first comment those officers say is we have a security officer who's been shot, the shots are definitely coming from room 135 and the officer, the security officer, is standing by the elevator. So my thing has always been this, if metro police officers and Mandalay Bay security officers are in the conversation and that all of a sudden across the security radio they hear Jesus Campos calling in that he's shot from the 32nd floor, why didn't the police dispatcher know right then where the shots were coming from? Because then people could have immediately responded up to that floor, but that did not happen. Because we never hear that on the police radio. For 15 minutes everybody's talking on the radio where are the shots coming from? Campos said the room number. - Yes. So then why should there be any confusion? - That's exactly my point. If he said over the radio and I didn't hear, I heard the recording they released later on, okay. MGM released recording. He said 3-2-1-3-5. - That's what he said. Now Sheriff Joe Lombardo at the first press conference in the early morning hours of October second told the press that once we found out the shooter was coming from the 32nd floor, the officers went up there and they engaged the suspect. He left out a very important factor. Fact was is they didn't go into that room, that room was not breached until an hour and five minutes after the last shot was fired. According to the police, the last shots were fired at 10:15. One lone SWAT officer, I'll get into that a little bit later, but the lone swat officer with three patrol officers breached that door at 11:20. So that's one hour and five minutes after the last shots were fired. A full SWAT team never arrived in that stairwell. When that door was breached at 11:20, there was one lone SWAT officer. His name was Levi Hancock. His team members never arrived to back him up. He had to use an ad hoc team of officers, two K-9 officers, with Sergeant Bitsko K-9 officer, Dave Newton was a K-9 officer, and Matthew Donaldson who was in uniform. He used those three officers as his team, because his SWAT team members never showed up to back up their lone SWAT team officer. That question to me is very important. Where were they? - I don't think the blame lies on the police for getting there slowly. If there is blame, and this will come out eventually, is the way the call was made. Should it have gone to his boss? Which is common practice at casinos, some say because it prevents the public from knowing about crime that takes place in casinos. Or is that a good thing? Because some say if he calls his boss, his boss can then call the police which will make it easier for them to find the spot where the crime is taking place. Sheriff Lombardo has been very appreciative publicly of MGM for all the help they've been able to give through this investigation. MGM has financed and will probably continue to finance the sheriff's campaign. Is that a conflict of interest? I don't know. Do you think there's some kind of coverup going on here? That's what a lot of people are saying that I've interviewed. - I'm really uncomfortable with the lack of information. The shooter they're saying the news we have now is he has no Facebook presence, he was a basic kind of a ghost. The security guard initially no Facebook presence, no online presence. I just don't know how an individual could do that accidentally in this day and age. - And Campos disappeared right after the shooting and then showed up on Ellen with a scripted response and story. And that's not just my interpretation of Campos on Ellen, that's coming from all of my clients that I've spoken to. And some who didn't wanna watch it, did anyways and couldn't believe that that was the story that was being provided to them. - It's just not an event that you make a comedic event. And she made it comedic in every which way she could possible. Then she went and rewarded them with football tickets. It was a horrendous softball interview, let's face it. - It pissed all of us off. It pissed me off. I couldn't even watch the whole interview. I read more about it and when I found out ate the end he got season passes to go watch the Raiders, I was like this is a joke. This is an absolute joke. - It was a publicity stunt to try to get their good PR back. Right, they're trying to get themselves to look good again. Let’s present him as a hero. Let’s tell Ellen what to ask, let’s tell him what to say to make him look like a hero. And it was offensive to the 22,000 people that were there. To this day he's gone underground. No one else has been able to contact him, find him. MGM had him sequestered in a property that they own. One of our investigators went to his house and there is a security guard, plain clothes, parked outside of his house in a car, just an unmarked car, that is most likely employed by MGM who hopped out quickly and cut her off at the path and said whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you need? Can I help you? No, you can't knock on that door. No, you can't go in. No, he's not here. So they're holding him. So the whole thing is a sham. If you saw Campos what would you ask him? - Why are you in hiding? What are you hiding? - We're a community here for you if you're part of our survivor group, but hiding makes me feel like you're not. - MGM is concerned about their liability. They should be. - The liability, the magnitude of liability on this case for MGM is potentially chapter 11 bankruptcy for MGM. That's how much liability exists. So they're going to be hunkered down protecting themselves and that's the way that it is because it is a major need that the people who where involved, our clients, that they know what happened. Psychologically and to heal from the trauma. So MGM's by protecting their money, they're hurting the people that were the victims of this horrendous crime. - I said that incompetence led to this massacre and the death of 58 people and the wounding and injuring. And people said why do you say that? And I said it's very simple. Number one, the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, they coordinate all these festivals, the concerts like this. The Route 91 music festival was almost on the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Boulevard, right behind the Tropicana hotel, Mandalay Bay's over there, Luxor over there, Excalibur over there, New York New York across the street over there, MGM Grand across the street on Tropicana on the other side. Now, nobody from the command staff of the Las Vegas metro police department ever thought that that outside venue opened up from the top could be vulnerable to an elevated sniper attack? Because that's happened 20, 30, 40 years in this country, elevated sniper attack in this country. Nobody thought about that. And the reason why I say that is because had they had counter snipers available standing by, they could have responded very quickly and at least countered his fire, the gunman's fire from coming out the window. So suppress it. That didn't happen. Were the exit signs clearly marked at the venue? - No. And I had made reference to that two years ago and then this year I had made the same statement. Specifically about Route 91? - Specifically about Route 91. That I felt like we were being herded in like cattle. In and out. There was only one way in and one way out that we knew of. - And I also blame the hotels. I spent 20 years in the hotel casino industry, not only as an investigator but as director and security surveillance at two different properties. Since 9/11, every hotel casino in Las Vegas was advised by the US Department of Homeland Security that the infrastructure is vulnerable to an active shooter incident or a Mumbai-type terrorist attack. And people say what does that have to do with the gunman at the Mandalay Bay? Very simple, he rolled in 23 weapons, loaded magazines, a thousand rounds ammunition, hundreds of magazines. Now, had there been an explosive K-9 detection team there as stuff was rolling in, that K-9, the dog, 90% with their nose would have hit on the explosive residue in those bags. The magazines, if he touched ammunition, the guns were fire, they weren't cleaned. The dog would have hit on it. - How did he get all of that stuff up there? How do they have no videotape of him? How did they not hear him drilling a hole as a person next to him in a room? - The cameras in Las Vegas can zoom in so close. Well today with modern technology, yeah. - With the technology I mean, if I'm a bartender and my bank is short, security can pull up right up under me and watch me count every dollar. Be like oh she counted 20 dollars short or something. So I just don't understand with all these, I know everybody just not looking at the blackjack table. You can catch people counting cards, we couldn't catch all this? - Why do you think we have virtually no video of the killer? - Well we've requested surveillance footage of the gunman in the casino. Obviously we know he walked in the casino at some point, had bags helped up to his room at some point. He did switch rooms at some point. And he I'm guessing was gambling, because we know he was a pretty consistent video poker player. So we know that there's probably footage that exists of him around the casino and we've requested it. But again, that's just one of the many things that we haven't had access to. - Our office sent out the subpoenas to MGM right away and we were met with legal maneuvering and denials and refusals. - The statement in response has always been we will out of respect for the victims we will address this through the appropriate legal channels. But really just hunkering down, not providing any information, fighting us at every turn. And that has been a big frustration not just for the lawyers, for myself and for Catherine, but also for our clients. Somebody most likely helped him move 10 large suitcases full of ammunition and guns. Whether or not the employee knew that that's what he was doing, the general elevator where you're going up and down, you're gonna be seen by people. There's gonna be people that are watching you. And if you're a high roller and you're just going up and down the freight elevator, that's considered okay by the employees. And that is very concerning for us that that was allowed. From what we know it does not look good for MGM. From my understanding and from what I know is that the killer had a do not disturb sign on his door for three days. And that went unquestioned by security. - Now the big debate is what level of privacy should we expect when we go to a casino on the Las Vegas strip? What is the difference between safety and security? I don't know what their policy is, because MGM won't say what the policy is when it comes to stuff like that. Some casinos are already changing their policies to say we have a 12 hour policy. If you have a do no disturb on your door, we're gonna check that out after 12 hours. Because no one should have a placard on for that long without it being checked. - MGM Resorts is running a publicity campaign to claim that somehow they couldn't foresee this happening. But I'm not buying that, because I believe it was totally foreseeable based on the recent terror events not only in the US, but around the world. All they had to do was tell the people staying at the hotel in the view rooms if they went through an airport style metal detector, the gunman never would have been able to bring up all his weaponry, all his ammunition. He would have been stopped. It never would have happened. So mothers and fathers would still be alive, husbands and wives would be alive, boyfriends, girlfriends would be alive, children would have their mothers and fathers. What's your reaction to people saying well you can't go around checking everyone's luggage, it's impossible? - You can check luggage very, very quickly, very, very efficiently. Especially if you're only checking people who are just moving it up into the upper floors. And I understand people they understand their privacy's at risk and that does have to be weighed. And that's something the legal process is also going to address. Privacy concerns are a matter of public policy and they are addressed on the judicial level. So I would tell people let's see what MGM knew and what could have been done to prevent it before we start talking about well, we're gonna have to just check every bag or we're gonna have to have metal detectors and our privacy's all gone. Well I think we shouldn't jump to those types of conclusions. I think we should take a look at the evidence, see what could have been done to prevent it. But of course, if that's what has to be done, then people have to understand when they go and stay in a large hotel where everybody's safety is at stake, they're going to have to submit just like on an airplane or a at large theme park, to some level of security. Just to make sure someone can't bring in an arsenal of weapons. - Vegas was honestly Vegas Strong. Everybody came together. And it should be like that all the time. It shouldn't have to take something like this to get everybody together. The next day the blood drives, it was incredible. Everybody showed up. There was like a seven hour wait, five hour wait, they still stayed there. Everybody actually cared about the humanity, about the fellow man. - We are a lot stronger after this. Those people will never be forgotten in this town. This town will survive, but this horrible tragedy will never be forgotten. This is what puts food on our table. This is what makes this city run. Without tourism this city isn't here. This is just desert. And for that to happen, it was just a slap in the locals' faces and I felt disgusted that someone would come here and do that. - It has changed a lot internally. We are very resilient her in Vegas, a strong community, we have #vegasstrong that we're promoting worldwide. All the hotels and businesses are showing their support for people that were injured in the event. If you had all 58 fallen victims in one room, what would you tell them? - First of all probably that I'm sorry that a lot of their lives were ended so quickly, so soon. But I guess that in honor of them and because of them, they have sparked this revolution across the world. It isn't even just here, it's everywhere from this tragedy. That people are doing good things in their memory. And I think that's a wonderful thing. I think that's the best thing that anybody can do for somebody. I wouldn't want somebody mourning me. I would want somebody going out and doing good deeds in memory of me. - You're so afraid to go to sleep 'cause you don't wanna have those nightmares. Do you think about this every day? - Every day. - Every day. - We live, we breath it. And you almost want not to. And we're not the same women we were before, we're two different people. We left and came home not whole. And we're finding our new normal. - There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I don't think about it. I'm grateful, if grateful's even a big enough word, to be out alive. I had cuts and scrapes and bruises, but grateful to be alive. To be able to go home and hug my kids and my family. We live near a shooting range, an outdoor shooting range. I don't walk my kids to school anymore. I don't go to the school and pick them up. We're close, they can walk home, they're old enough now. But we live by an outdoor shooting range and the sound of automatic gunfire every day comes in. I'll hear it and it puts me right back in that moment when I look at my husband and say what drunk idiot set off a brick of firecrackers in an crowd of people? And the whole thing replays. - At first the first couple of weeks, it was depression. And I just didn't even wanna get out of bed. It's almost like you're going for a funeral for 58 people when you go visit the Mandalay Bay. It was very, very sad. And I had to leave work after a couple of weeks, panic attacks. And then one day I just said I can't keep living like this. It humbled me. And I'm happy to be alive, I made it. So it changed me to just appreciate good people and to help people. - A friend of mine that I worked with was passing out the bands and giving us our polo shirts to wear, 21 years old, Erick Silva, he didn't make it. And I will never take this off. Never. So that thing's been on your wrist since October first? - Yeah, and it will never come off. - Who knows what could've happened if I moved differently one second prior to that. - And there's 58 people that passed away and didn't get to live that second chapter of their life and I feel like I need to live it for them. - Will you ever go back this concert, Route 91? - Absolutely. You don't go back, he wins. Whoever the shooter was or were, they win if you don't go back. - How do you think the community changed in Vegas? You're someone who's lived there for a long time. - Yeah, I don't think it's changed a lot. I think it just showed how tight of a community it is. It's a big city, but it's a small town feeling. It showed how good the people are that live in the city. It was amazing to see after what all happened you would go to the grocery store, we went to pick some stuff up for the fire department and there's four, five different people filling carts full to take it all over the city wherever they needed it. And you're going to the blood bank and you're getting turned down, because the line's around the corner. So it just showed the support that everyone had in the city for what happened. We're 65 games in, whatever we are now, there's still a big part of us that are playing for the city. You still get told that the games are just a time for people to take their mind of what happened. Whatever we can do to help those people heal we're willing to do it. And when you're winning games it makes it that much better. - Anything else Deryk Engelland actually would like to add to tell all the Las Vegas fans and just anything you'd like to add about anything? - We're still Vegas Strong. Do you get a lot of customers asking you about the incident? - Yeah, I do. And before I wanted to tell everybody, but now I only talk about it if they bring it up. If they say how's Vegas doing? And I say well you know it's okay and did you see any of the videos? No, and then I don't really say anything. But if they say so were you there the night of the shooting? I say well, you asked me so I'm gonna tell ya. And sometimes I even show them the video. - It tells you that tomorrow's not a given. And I never thought I'd say that here in America, that I'd be part of something like this. You take your day that you have, enjoy it. Because you never know.
