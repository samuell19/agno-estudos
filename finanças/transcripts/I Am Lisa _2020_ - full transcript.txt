Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** Well, I guess we gotta find another one. Hemingway! Are you a fan? He was a genius... But...? Too much machismo for me. For talking authors who killed themselves, I'll take Virginia Woolf. - Did my other book come in yet? - Yes, erm... Here you go. I hope you don't mind I read some of it. Kind of bad about that. I can't help myself. What do you think? Pretty fascinating stuff. Like the old tales of people turning into wolves, and... town drunkards stealing chickens and losing their minds over the the full moons. - They're probably just mentally ill. - How do you know? Because I can't know for sure but I don't really believe in the supernatural stuff. Maybe what some consider supernatural is simply... unexplained scientific phenomena. Now we're talking! Here's for both. Keep the change. - Lisa, right? - Yeah. And thanks. I was... sorry to hear about your Grandmother. - Thanks, Miss Todder. - Please, just Mary. Thanks for coming in, Mary! Hi, Mary! Oh, you dropped your books. Oh, shit! Always good to see you, sweetie. Okay, everybody... It's closing time. What the hell? What's up, bitch? Jessica Huckins, immature as ever. Could you please leave? - But I'm looking for a book. - I didn't know you can read. Lisa... always the wittiest one in the room. I think this will do nicely. Fahrenheit 451? I don't think you'll understand it. I'm not gonna read it! I'm gonna burn it. I really wish you could get the irony of that. You'd better not. You're no fun. Why doesn't it surprise me that burning books is your idea of fun? Hey, Lisa... Why did you come back? Everyone was so happy when you left. Her Grandma, girl... So, what, she dies and leaves you... all this? Yup! She went and got some fancy degree overseas and... now you're right back where you started. What a waste. I like the movie! Maybe I'll like the book. What do you think? Fits you. For two-hundred dollars, you can take it home. - Are you out of your fucking mind? - It's a first edition. Sure. I'll tell you what. I'm just gonna take it. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. Later, bitch! Don't, Lisa... it's easier this way. This is nothing a spirited beverage or two can't conquer. Also our friend M.J. All right. Some beers. D'you know what you wanna eat? - We will take a veggie crust. - Right. - You got it. - Thanks, Emma. - Thanks, Emma... - Shut up! God, that book was expensive. It's not even like I can report it. Yeah, her mother won't do anything to Mommy's little country princess. She didn't even do anything when Gretchen went missing. She's not gonna give a shit about a book. Maybe I can go to the State Police. There's gotta be somebody above her somewhere. I'll tell you what... Later on we'll slash Jessica's tires. They've gotta be worth the same as the book, right? Probably it would make me feel a little better. Let's see to this. To Northbrook. Where the Huckins clan and all eligible bachelors are scum. I don't need a man! I practice self-love. Oh! Don't we all? - To self-love, then. - To self-love. - I know, I know... I can't push it. I know. Not what I thought. - Right? - Fun! - Here we go. (Indistinct) - Oh, my God! They want a special coot. Morgan! We're going to kill you, Morgan! Morgan! Do you hear? Morgan! Morgan! Told you, the coot was right! Do you hear, Morgan? Morgan! Do you hear, Morgan? But you lived through all this. Do you know why? Perhaps I was chosen. Hm. You're freaks! I'm a man. The last... man. - Oh, doctor Robert. - Robert! He does everything he can. They were afraid of me. This was different on the book. They were afraid of me. -Bye! - Bye! Don't forget to love yourself. Oh, don't forget to drink my Vincent. Oh, no, thank you! Bye! Oh, shit! Hey, bitch! What do you want, Jessica? Brought your book back. This isn't a library. I know, I know, I suck. How can I make it up to you? You can stop calling me bitch! Consider it done! You could apologize for once in your life. I am sorry, Lisa. I know it's not enough. How about we hang out some time? I'll be nice, I promise! - What are you on? - Come on! We'll drive all the way to Kansas City... I'll take you to that Art Museum, seems like something you'd like. It is! But not with you. Wow! You've never liked me, have you? Why would I? Listen, Lisa... can I...? bare my soul to you just a little? Now, what's wrong? I... There's just something I wanted to tell you. Go on, what? This. What the hell are you doing? What? You and Sam all through Highschool. She's my best friend, you idiot! What the hell is the matter with you? You wanna know what I think about you, Lisa? You're gonna cry now? - Don't flatter yourself. - Hmm, that's too bad. You just give me a hard-on. Fuck you. No, Lisa... Fuck you! Get out of here! And leave me alone! Wrong move. What other choice do I have, Sam? I know, it's just... This is Deb Huckins we are talking about. If I don't do anything, Jessica is just gonna keep taking advantage of me. You want me to go with you? I can leave and meet you there. No. I got it. Thanks. Of course. Hmm. Yup! The tree again? No! I said no, Mrs. Pedersen. I can't come out there and get your cat out of the goddamned tree every time it runs up there. Sheriff, this is important. Because it's a damned cat. That's what they do. If I come out there, I'm gonna blow it to smithereens with my shotgun. Yeah, bye, Mrs. Pedersen. Idiots! Okay, Lisa, what is it? Nick! Start taking a report. Last week Jessica came into my store with some of their friends. And she chased off all my customers. And stole a rare copy of "The Clockwork Orange." Heck of a book. No harm, babushka. Doesn't that constitute theft? Babushka? Where is the book now? That leads me to today. I was alone in the store and she came back in with the book... Wait, hold on a second. She brought the book back? Yeah, but that doesn't matter, she stole it. Well, maybe she thought you were running a little library or something. Sure, let's pretend that makes sense. She brought the book back and then she... came on to me. She has good taste, Lisa. I'm serious, she spit in my face. Well, nobody ever died from a little sputum. She assaulted me. How? She kissed me and I didn't... That's not assault. Then what do you call it? It's a kiss, dum-dum! It's a kind gesture. It wasn't consensual. - That is text book... - Forget it, it's not assault... If nobody got hit. That's bullshit. What do you think, Nick? It ain't assault if nobody got hit. You got that right, Ma. Learnt that at the academy. The very first day. Besides, she's a good girl. You ain't hurt or nothing. Why don't you let this one pass? Nick, stop the report. I knew it. - You're not going to do anything. - Like I said... No harm, no foul. There ain't no point to any of this. Okay, I'm just gonna take this to the... County Trash Man or whoever the hell has authority over you, and tell them what's going on here, so thanks for nothing. That's no way to talk to the Town Sheriff, is it, Lisa? You seem to have a bit of an attitude problem. That sounds like disturbing the peace there, Sheriff. D'you hear that? Disturbing the peace. How'd you like to spend the night in jail? - I didn't do anything. - Disorderly conduct. Epp! Let me go! Resisting arrest, too. She put her hands on me too, Mom. - Is that right? - Hmm. Well, maybe you're the one that committed assault, huh, Lisa? Might have to lock you up for a long time. Easy, now! Did I ever tell you about your Grandma? She fucked her way across the whole town. I'm surprised you haven't followed suit. How's that for assault, sweetie? Please, let me go. I promise I won't tell nobody. When I was a little girl, we had a dog named Otto, I loved that dog but he was stubborn as hell, so my Daddy beat the shit out of him to teach him a lesson. Here's how I can tell you are just a bitch that needs to be taught a very severe lesson, All right, Jess, she's out of my hands. You know what to do. All right. I'm gonna enjoy this. Millie, you want in on this? No. Nick? It's not worth me scratching off my boots. Come on! I think that's enough for a lesson. Well... She needs a permanent reminder. Knock out a couple of her teeth with a hammer and pliers. I'm sure doctor Wilkins could use the tooth fix to make her new dentures. You're sick! All right, I'll take her through. It's now gonna happen! Don't think for one second I won't cut your balls off. It does give me an idea. Give me your pliers, Nick. Everyone's gonna have to hold her down for this one. Hey! Can't you idiots do anything right? Now what do we do with her? You take her car and you sink it in the river. - Go on and get on it. - All right. Nick, you guys take her out to the woods, and feed her to the wolves. They prefer live game. You got it. And Nick... make sure you finish the lesson. Well, good thing Jess isn't here for this. Here. It's okay, Lisa. You're safe, here. - Where am I? - My cottage! - You remember me, right? - Yeah. What were you dreaming about? Wolves. Got a nasty bite from one. Don't worry. I cleaned it out for you and bandaged you up. What time is it? Four o'clock in the afternoon. You've been asleep for almost ten hours. Do you remember anything? You're lucky you survived. Where is this cottage? A few miles outside of High Mills. High Mills? I knew they took me north. They? You live in Northbrook, right? Yeah. Nice little town. Sheriff's a bitch. Can I get you something? Coffee, water, whisky? That's tempting. I'll take water. Thank you. For taking care of me, Mary. Happy to help. Drink up. And then, I think you should get some more rest. I'll take you home later. - Or to the Sheriff Office... - No! Get some more rest, I insist. Sorry about the clothes. No, it's okay. I appreciate it. That's for my dog. Gus. Mary, could you just take me home? Come on, let's go. Why don't you tell me what really happened? I'd rather not. You can trust me. Some people beat me up, and left me in the woods... and I don't want them to know I'm alive. Beat you up? Look, you saved my life. And I'll never be able to thank you enough for that. You're welcome. Where the hell have you been? Been worried out of my freaking mind. No bruises, no fractures that I can see. There should be some marks left behind. I ripped two of my fingernails, look. Maybe you just... Got a concussion and that didn't actually happen? Maybe. And I cut my forehead. And it's gone. Like it was never there. Just the bite wound which is hard to heal for some reason. I don't get it. Can I stay with you for a while? I don't want them to find me. I guess. Of course! You should've moved in with me when you came back. Stop! Did I hit it? Hide the weed! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you guys coming. No, it's okay, we almost hit you. - Don't worry, that should be fine. - Yeah, it's not that bad. My friend should be out in a second, she's a nurse. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Hey, hey, let me go, let me go! - Lisa! What was that all about? I just felt really weird. What the hell is happening? Where are your clock hen specs? I broke them and now I can see just fine without them. You know what? I think we should be proactive. How? Sheriff, I need your help. We're on our break, Sam. Yeah, I know, I couldn't find you at the station and I saw your car here. Well, it must be an emergency, then. Yeah, I can't find my friend Lisa anywhere. She's not at home, she hasn't opened her store, I can't find her car, it's... like she just disappeared. Did you say her car is gone? Well, maybe she just left town, like went on a little vacation or something. She's not answering her phone either. It just goes to voicemail. Well, that is strange, but... these sort of things happen all the time. I think it's best just to wait a little bit. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people just leave and then they show back up. She wouldn't leave without contacting me. Can I fill out a missing person report or something? No, it's questionable if she's even missing. - So you're not gonna do anything? - Look... Don't get your panty in a whirl. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll go by her apartment and her store, snoop around town a little bit, see what we can turn up. Does that sound all right? Thanks. Run along now, Samantha. Did you leave her there? I left her in the woods, up on High Mill. Well, I figure the wolves would eat her or... - Maybe Dolphus might put her in that little... - Look, Ma... Leap off into a wolf is closing in, all right? She is either in the woods or that freak got her. We'll see. - What's up? - Yeah, is Millie with you? Put me on speaker. Will you two idiots turn off your games for two seconds? Lisa Miss Laroux is a missing person and she is gonna stay a missing person for ever. You two idiots are taking this to your grave or I'm gonna put you there myself, you understand? - Yeah, Mom, we got it. - Hmhm. Now, let's go through the motions... Get your shit, we must go. Copy that, Ma. They're totally playing it off. They say they're gonna look for you but I don't think they know you're alive. Thank God. What happened? You'd better find her. Are you gonna be a little chicken shit like you were with Gretchen? - Don't act like you didn't like it. - [GASPS] I heard you last night. Oh. How could I not? You need help. No, I don't. I can deal with this on my own. I'm worried about you. I just... I need to get out of the house, so I'm just gonna go for a drive. Someone will see you, dipshit! I won't get out of my car until I'm way out of town. Be careful. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** I'm sorry to keep you late but we gotta get this done. What do you wanna eat? I'm not hungry. Okay, I'll be back in a few. Jerry? Jerry, is that you? [GASPS] Lisa... I'm so sorry. We shouldn't have done it to you. You didn't deserve it. [GASPS] Yeah. I meant to... I didn't like it. Exactly. Lisa? What happened? Millie Thompson, I think I killed her. You think you killed her? Go on. I... I couldn't stop myself. - Did anyone see you? - No one. What's going on with you? What if they find out it was you? I can't believe you actually killed someone. - Lisa, Lisa! - What?! What are we gonna do? I know what I'm gonna do. What? It's pulling out. Millie Thompson died in the auto shop. Fuck. Lisa Laroux... Killer? What the hell is happening? If you don't feel comfortable with me staying here, I can leave. And what are you gonna do? Live in the woods? No, but I know someone who does. You're scaring off my paying customers, Mom. You hear? About Millie? Yeah. It may have looked like an accident but I can guarantee you it wasn't. - Lisa. - Damn straight. We gotta find her. Your brother and I are gonna pay our friend a little visit. - What do you want me to do? - Take this. Get over to her place and see if she shows up there. Try not to fuck it up. Okay... I'm Lisa... And you are...? Fucking creepy. Hey, Lisa! What is happening to me, Mary? You know, don't you? You were bitten by a special kind of wolf. And now you are one. Okay, I told you I don't believe in the supernatural. It's not supernatural. It's scientific phenomena. And I just ran into into this really shady dude in the woods. Stay away from him at all costs! You're developing special abilities. It affects every one differently. Most people who actually survive an attack with only a bite, die of an infection within hours. What the hell is this? A picture of me and my sister. Sister? You know she's the Antichrist, right? We had a rough upbringing. Our father was a drunk and... Somewhere along the line, Debbie became obsessed with power. Yeah, I'd say. She... usurped the Sheriff's position by staging his disappearance. Pretty sure she fed his carcass to the wolves. Wolves? I am losing control of myself. - I have done things that... - Embrace it! Then you can learn to control it. Lisa, listen to me very carefully. You already have the power to overcome your ordeal. Now, you have the power to make sure that those that wronged you, pay for what they did. Take this. Read the rest of it. Open up or I'm gonna break the door down! What do you want? Ermm, excuse me, can I help you with something? What is that, petulae? - Yeah, so? - Where is she? - What the hell are you talking about? - Don't play Coy with me. We're looking for Lisa. Nick, start searching the place. I haven't seen her. Why do you think I went down to your station yesteday? And I'm pretty sure you can't search my place without a warrant or something. You can take that warrant and you can shove it up your backside. Now, we're gonna start searching this place and you'd better pray to High Heaven that we don't find her, you understand? Fine. Go ahead and search. You're not gonna find anyhting! You see? I told you she'd give us permission. I found this brick of weed. No sign of Lisa. Did you get this from Jessie? No. Her competition. Look, I told you wouldn't find anything. My friend is missing. - Would you please find her? - All right! But if we find out she's been here, you're both going to jail. That is unless you wanna come down to the station and fill out a report. Get the fuck out of my house! All right, Nick, let's go. Oh! And we're confiscating your dope. Next time buy from Jessie. Assholes. Oh, thank God it's you! They came here, Liz. - They know something's up. - I know. - What's wrong? - Jessica's passed out at my place. Did you...? You know... No. Good. To get some answers, though. Hey, Sam, come here for a sec? Okay. The last thing you ate today was a salad, with Romaine lettuce, and spinach, Cherry tomatoes, almond slivers, croutons and... varied vinaigrette dressing. Oh, and you're ovulating. - Wow! - Right? - What else does it say? - Hmmm. It says that I can heal from all but the most severe wounds, or ones made with silver. Fire and decapitation can also kill me. Yay! And, erm... There's an entry here in Spanish that says, ´Cuidado con la primera luz lunar´ So, beware of the first lunar light. What happens then? Hmm... I can possibly turn into a wolf and stay that way, or I could turn into an... 'Híbrido' A cross-breed. I'm strong. I'll stay lucid and if not, I could permanently lose my mind. So, that's great. This all went down during the full Moon, right? Yeah. I say we leave town... like... for ever.

Millie deserved to go better. You don't. Fuck you! She was my friend! I'm just protecting mine. - Lisa! - I did it again! D'you smell like fries? Did you bring me any? Restaurant's normally closed today. Folks couldn't find her, so they came here looking for her. God, I wonder how long she was held there. Well... Shit. Oh, no! Lisa! They're gonna suffer. This isn't you. Don't stoop to their level. And I know you think they ruined your life. But they didn't take everything. You're still alive. They did take everything. Lisa... I'll never feel whole again. You're still you. Don't forget that. You're the only one I've got left. I actually like soppy you, so. Obviously not a vegetarian anymore. Didn't we agree to leave? We should've done that already. We got nothing keeping us here now. I need to take care of Jessica and Nick on Friday night. After that... Millie and Dana are dead, right? Do you feel any better? What about Deb? I want her to know it was me. Lisa, these are dangerous people and you're not invincible. I'll be careful. They can't hurt me! I don't wanna lose my friend to those hayseed... You won't! I promise. See you later, baby. You're doing okay? Can we go? No. You're gonna sit here and you're gonna keep that little mouth shut. You got it? Who's that? Mama. You are worthless, Percer. D'you know that, right? Hmm, you must be new. What's your name? Vir- Virginia. Virginia. It has a nice ring to it. What do you say we get out of this hell hole? Come on. Hurry up! Nice leggings. That should get you more business. I guess. All right, well, you're new here so I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be, all right? You will provide me with full service. Free of charge. And in exchange, I'm not gonna haul you off to jail. Pretty sweet deal, huh? All right. Let's get kinky. All right! Enough of this. D'you think I'm fucking stupid, Lisa? What the fuck? What the f...? How's this for full service? Bitch! Don't bother! It's definitely broken. Argh! Fuck you! Playtime is over! Nick? Come in, Nick! Nick, I said come in, goddammit! Nick, where in the hell are you? Finally. I thought you would never die. Where's Nick? He left... with the girl. - What's up, bitch? - Lisa! You scared the shit out of me. What the hell are you doing here? Looking for you. - Are you in a hurry? - Erm... I'm just here with somebody, I should probably see how they're doing. Forget about 'em. I sought you out because I wanted to bare my soul to you. Oh, yeah? I like what you did to me. Let me get out of here. What? Do you think I'm some kind of idiot? I'm serious. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I want more. Kiss me. Don't. Nick? You have your radio on you? Why is your car out there on Field Street? I need you to meet me back at the station. Nick? Hello, Sheriff. It's me. Oh, good! I've been looking for you. Say, Sheriff, you weren't hoping for grandkids anytime soon, now, were you? Goddammit! Perhaps I can repay you for that. Why don't you meet me back at the station? I got a little surprise for you. And what's that? I got your best friend with me. What? Yup! The lovely Samantha. Don't you fucking touch her. She didn't come along willingly. Put her on. I wanna hear her voice. She can hear you, but... She can't come to he phone right now, you're just gonna have to trust me on that one. I'm coming for you, Deb. We'll be waiting for you at the police station. I'ma get you out of there, Sam. Don't worry, I promise! Yeah, Dolphus? It's me, Deb. Yeah, well, I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't have her. Yeah, I got her friend too. You need to meet me down at the station. Now. A-ha, bring your gear with you. We're gonna have us a little fun, ain't we, Samantha? Sit your ass down! Fuck you! You stay if you know what's good for you. Bitch must be here. You think you can sneak up on me? That's the second time I popped you in here, isn't it? You should've seen it. I slit your daughter's throat. And I ate Nick. I know how to deal with your kind. Silver weapon. Good for you. Doplhus, help me get her up. Yeah, you hold her arms in place. Here we go. Damn! She's a feisty one, ain't she, D? Here. Just do the other one. Yeah. Go get the brand. We've been hunting wolves for years. I figured you'd become one. Or at least make a nice meal for them. It's a sign of your kind. Now, I'm sorry, Lisa. But we gotta keep track of you. Hold still. I don't wanna mess up the girl. Silver brand. That mark ain't never going away. I am gonna kill you. The Lord knows I've heard that one before. Now we wait for the full Moon to see what's gonna happen. Oh, you've heard, haven't you? Most folks turn permanently... and we have to hunt them. Others... develop wolf-like features during the full Moon and return to being human the next day. Last one we had like that escaped, recently. She was your cousin, if I'm not mistaken. - Gretchen. - Yeah. What happened to her? We caught her and I had to kill her. Seven years is a long time to be held captive by this weirdo. We're hoping with your lineage you're one of the special ones, and if you are... We're gonna hack off your limb, so you can't get away. Silver axe. They won't grow back. And then Dolphus is gonna put you in a little box. And Sam? I'm not sure. We might have you bite her, see if we can turn her too. - Please, let her go. - Now, don't fight it, sweetheart. There's nothing you can do to stop it. Hell, that's it. I think she's done, D. Lisa, can you hear me? Is there anyone at home? Fuck you! Damn, I've never had one I can talk to during the full Moon. Here, let me... This one's personal. Do me instead! Do me instead! - What? What do you want? - Do me instead! Do me instead! What are you saying? - Do me instead? - No! Hell! There ain't nobody on this planet I'd do that for, least of all my best friend. What? You want me to test axe on you? See how sharp it is? That's a good idea. Now, let's see. Nose... Ears... You two are touching, you really are. Don't worry, Sam. I'm gonna go easy on you. Here. Neat and sharp. All right, Lisa. The only time you're coming out of that box... is when Dolphus wants to play. Bitch! Okay, Lisa... No more games. But I love playing 'Kill the Sheriff'. Did you really eat Nick? Huh... Can you keep your mouth over there? Who shot Deb? What are you doing here? Shooting my sister and saving your life. You're welcome! How were you following me without me knowing? I stayed downwind of you. Can we maybe do this somewhere else? I have a couple of things I need to take care of. ♪ Wake up, little pig ♪ What are you doing? You said so yourself. My friends out here... The wolves... They prefer live game. You can't leave me out here. Sure I can! You'd be nothing without me. I am a new terror. Born in death. What's your name? Brooke. - Let's go, Brooke. - Hey! What the fuck is this? Are you a monster? I'm Lisa. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***
