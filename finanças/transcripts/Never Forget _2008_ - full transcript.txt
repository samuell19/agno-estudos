[reel clicks and spinning] [dark music] [gunshot] [dark music continues] [rustling] [rustling continues] [eerie music] [rapid breathing] [eerie music continues] [grunting] [rope snaps] [groaning] [rope snaps] [rope snaps] [thud] [groaning] [breathless groaning] [gasping] [grunts] [grunting continues] [winces] Tom Martin. [rapid breathing] [high pitched ringing] What's happening here? Hello? [eerie music] Hello? Anyone? [eerie music continues] [whispers] Ok... just calm down. [whispers] Think... think. [branch breaks] [anticipatory music] [anticipatory music continues] [grunting] Shit. [rapid breathing] [unsettling music] What the fuck happened to me? [unsettling music continues] [grunts] [sighs] [high pitched ringing] [muffled] I love you. [exhales] [rapid breathing] Frank Hill. I'm Frank Hill. Tom Martin. Frank. Frank. I am Frank Hill. Frank. [suspenseful music] [thud] [screaming] [kicking] Mother fucker. [kicking] Stop it, please. What, you're begging now, huh? You want mercy now? Fuck you. Open your eyes. Open your eyes! -[crying] Please don't shoot me. -Open your eyes. [crying] Ok... just please don't shoot me. Where Frank? -What? -Tell me where? Where what, how do you know me? -I am gonna count to three. -No, no! -Then I'm going to fucking kill you! -No, please, please, Just tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it, I swear. One... -two... -[crying] I don't know, please you gotta believe me, I don't know anything. [crying continues] I don't know anything, please. Shit! Don't move. Are you Tom? What? Are you Tom, Tom Martin, Is that you, am I right? What the fuck are you talking about, who's Tom Martin? -No one, I guess. -It's Andy, ok? I'm Andy. -Get up! -What? Get up! [ominous music] [ominous music continues] You know, you don't have to keep shoving that fucking thing in my back, every 30 seconds. -Shut the fuck up and keep moving. -I can't move any faster. I don't care. Why are you doing this to me, huh? What have I ever done to you? Come on tell me, what have I done? I'm not buying this bullshit, this "I can't remember", "I can't walk", "can't run". It's not bullshit. -Stop fucking shoving me! -You know what, spare me the fucking act! Well go ahead then! -[gun loading] -Go ahead! [crying] Just fucking shoot me and get it over with, if you're gonna do it. [crying continues] I can't move any faster, I don't remember anything. I woke up in the woods, I was hanging upside down in the middle of nowhere. Look at me... is this real? I don't know who you are... I'm sorry, I don't. I don't know where I am, I don't know where we're going. Fuck... fuck, I don't even know who I am. Please... please, I'm begging you... just fill in some of my blanks. [gun clicks] The cabin... What? We'll go to the cabin. What cabin? You know what cabin. -You know. -Why are we going there? -[ominous music] -To fill in your blanks. Just like you asked. Now, come on. [ominous music continues] [thud] [grunting] [grunting continues] Why Tom? Huh? Why did you call me Tom? I... I don't know, I don't know anything. I know you don't know... anything, but why did you choose Tom? -Why didn't you call me Pete or Matt, why Tom? -No idea, it's just a name. If you say so. [thunder rumbling] -What's going to happen when we get to this cabin? -What do you mean? I mean, why are we heading there? Seriously, why? Fuck. [thunder rumbling] [water sloshing] [Frank] Why are you out here? -[Andy] To find you. -[Frank] Yeah, I got that much. I mean, why are you out here in general, why aren't you sitting at home, in front of your TV, drinking wine or something? [Andy] It's a long story. This is fucking insane. Tell me about it. -I need to sit. -No, we don't have time. [thunderstorm] [grunts] I just made time. Jesus Christ Frank, come one, we've gotta keep going, we've gotta move. Would you look at my head, huh? If you gonna drag me through these woods endlessly, then I need a minute to sit down. Besides, my fucking knee is killing me. -Fine, one minute... and then we move. -Yeah sure, whatever you say. -Sit down, you're making me dizzy. -No, I'm not gonna sit down. Sit or I'm gonna need two minutes. [thunderstorm continues] You ever kill anyone, Andy? You don't seem too sure. Even an average guy can find himself in a situation where he has to do something drastic. You don't think you could kill someone, no matter the circumstances. Would you just please shut up, you're trying to confuse me. About what, I'm the one who can't remember anything. Just seems cowardly, that's all. What did you say? [tense music] Nothing. [sighs] I just said it seems cowardly, a real man would protect his family, no questions asked. Fuck you! Hey, what are you getting so pissed about? -Get the fuck up... get up! -What for? Because we're going. [throbbing] [high pitched ringing] I love you. [high pitched ringing] Um... a woman. [gun clicking] What about a woman? I keep seeing this woman. Is there anyone else out here. -How do you mean? -I mean, is it just you and I? Who's at the cabin? No one. Are you sure? What are you thinking? -I don't know, I just keep seeing this woman. -Describe her to me? She's got... her hair is kinda... -What? -Fuck, I don't know, she's just a woman, -I don't know who she is. -Can you see where she is? Are you sure she's not at the cabin? -I don't like this. -Yeah, I don't like it either. I'm not even sure about going to the cabin anymore. I mean, I got a bad feeling. Just wanna stick around in the woods, is that it? -Do you even know where we are? -Of course I do. Yeah? How close are we, when will we be there? -We're going to get there when we get there, Frank. -Don't call me Frank. It's your fucking name, isn't it? Yeah, but I don't want you doing it anymore, it's like you're trying to convince me of my name. "Where, Frank?" "Let's go, Frank", "this way, Frank". -I'm not trying to do anything like that, Frank. -There, you see, you see... you did it again. What, you sulking now, huh, is that it? Would you please... would you please just get up. Come on, I don't have time for this shit. Time for what? -Time for what? -You got shit you've got to find out, right? You think you're going to find out sitting in the middle of the fucking woods? [thunderstorm] You're right. I am. Ok. Let's go. [dark music] What? Nothing. Oh fuck! What? Look at that... you see that? We have been in this exact same spot before, we past that fucking thing before. Do you wanna lead now? It that it? You've got a sudden recollection of where you are or something? I'm just saying, it seems like you're having a little trouble finding our way, like maybe we're lost or something. Well we're in the fucking middle of nowhere... you got a map, you got a compass? It's not like we've got a lot of options here. No god damn cell service, there's no Park Rangers coming to help us out. I'll get us there, I'll... You're familiar with the area though, right? -Just shut up. -I'm just asking. Well, stop asking! Look... obviously, I'm the one who's in the dark here, so to speak. I'm just wondering how often you come up here? I don't know, once, maybe a few times, I told you to stop fucking asking questions. Alright, ok, look, I didn't mean to get you so worked up. -Let's just find the god damn cabin. -That's great. Lead the way. -You know what, you lead. -Me? Yeah. How do you expect me to find it? Fine. Fine. Fucking idiotic. [dark music] [dark music continues] -You got a stitch or something? -No. Just keep moving. [swishing] [muffled talking and sounds]] -She could be trouble. -What did you say? Then move! [thud] Jesus Christ, give me your hand. [thump] [grunting] [anticipatory music] [anticipatory music continues] [thud] [groan] [grunting] [anticipatory music continues] [dark music] Frank? Frank? Come on, Frank. Look, this is stupid. Just come out and we can help each other out. -Let's go you two, I wanna be drunk by noon. -Oh, such class. I'll be sure to do the shots with my pinky extended. [giggling] I've really been looking forward to this weekend. Frank... listen to me, we need each other out here. Come on, we need to... help each other here. [grunts] [high pitched ringing] [whispers] What the fuck is happening to me. I'm not angry about the rock, Frank. Ok buddy? I understand. Ok, now we're even. Come on, Frank! Frank? Fuck. Frank? -[suspenseful music] -[Andy] Frank? Fuck it. [suspenseful music continues] [branch snaps] -[Andy] Don't do anything stupid. -What did you do to her? -What are you talking about? -What did you do? Get back! -Take it easy. -What did you do to her? -Fuck you! You did it. -Liar. -Frank, what did you do? -I'm not falling for that one. What did you do, Frank? [dark music] Who's that? What the hell is going on here? -Is that a cop? -It's a park ranger. Tom Martin. Holy shit. How do you know him? -I don't know. -[Andy] Bullshit. I don't. Who else is out here? What are you talking about? Did you know he was here? Yeah... exactly. That means we are not alone. I got a feeling there's someone else out here. [Andy] You know him. You called me Tom... Tom Martin. [gunshot] -Who are they? -Who? The people in the room... the blood. -[Andy] What people? -I don't know. But there are other people out here. -He was shot. -Yeah, I can see that. He's been fucking shot for Christ sakes. -You did this. -Look at his face, Frank... that slash, that's your handy work. That's his knife, isn't it? -No. -That's his fucking knife, Frank. Well that's his gun, I am tired of you jerking me around, like I'm some fucking idiot. And I'm getting tired of you. You are never gonna be able to tell me what I need to know. [gun clicks] Oh yeah, so what, you just going to shoot me now, like you shot him? [spluttering] -[gurgling] -Holy shit, he's still alive. -Jesus. -[Frank] What do we do now? -We? You did this. -Stop saying that, I didn't kill anyone. -We gotta help him. -There's nothing we can do. Well, we gotta do something. What do you propose, huh? I do know this guy. [Andy] What did you just say? You alright? You alright? I'm sorry, I need to go. [Andy] What did you say? -Nothing. -You said something about the Ranger. I said, we need to help this guy. -It's a little too late for that. -What, we just going -to let him die? -Says the guy with a knife in his hand? -I don't know how I got this. -You don't seem to know much of anything, do you, Frank? Look at him. He's already dead, what can we do, huh? We can't carry him, there's no Goddamn hospital out here. Now, I'm sorry to be the one to say it, but we're leaving him behind, so let's go. -No. -No? We take care of this first. How, answer me that? How do you want to take care of him? -Shoot him. -What? Shoot him. -He's not a deer, Frank. -Shoot him and put him out of his misery. If we're not going to carry him, then shoot him now so that he doesn't choke -on his fucking blood, please! -I'm not shooting him. -Then I will. -With what? -Give me the gun? -You stay back. -Give me the gun? -Stay back. -Give me the gun or shoot him? -Stay back... get back! You give me that gun, or you shoot him? Shoot him! Fuck you. He's dead. [sombre music] What? -So now what? [sighs] -No we get the hell out of here, unless you wanna hang around a corpse? No, I guess not. Wait. You'll leave the knife. I'm serious. Besides, it has his name on it, do you really want to be stuck with a knife that ties you to this body? No. So, put it back. Just leave it. [grunting] Thank you. Now, let's go. Go where, we're totally lost. We were, you see this creek? It runs right by the cabin, we follow this and we'll get there, so now let's go. Frank? Don't you ever touch this, don't you ever touch it! It was in my pocket, you give it back to me. Fuck you. You know who that is, don't you? Where is she, what have you don’t to her? -What have I done to her? -What have you done to her, Andy? Where is she, you tell me! -Where, you tell me where? -That's what I've been trying to get out of you this whole time. I've been tip toeing around these woods with you, a fucking psycho, hoping you'll remember what you did with her. Are you nuts? She's my wife. Yeah, she's my wife. [tense music] Now you tell me what you did with her? -I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. -Tell me where, Frank? Fuck you! [tense music continues] I will shoot you. I will shoot you in the fucking face, don't think I won't do it. You think you're the only killer in these woods? I will do it. -Oh, I'm the killer? You killed the Ranger. -[Andy] You had his gun. -What gun? -This gun! You killed them all, Frank. That's why we're the only two sons of bitches left out here, everyone else is dead! But I know you didn't kill Tasha... You were two obsessed with her for that shit, now you tell me where she is? No... no. That picture was in my pocket. It's because you've been stalking her for months! You sick, crazy, fuck! It hurts, please stop, we were meant to be together. I can see it in your eyes, you know it's true. -No. -You killed the Ranger. No. You killed Kurt... you killed Sarah... and then you took Natasha, now where did you take her? -I couldn't have done this, she was talking to me. -It's all in your head! -It's a fantasy, Frank. -No, no, no, that's not true. -No, that's not true. -Yes it is, you know it, stop lying. -I couldn't have done this. -You did. -No. -You're starting to remember, aren't you? -No. -Now, tell me where she is? -Stop it! -Tell me where she is! You're starting to remember shooting Kurt, aren't you? He'll get over it, they all do. [giggling] You're simple that way, oh except you, baby. [door opening] Andy? Frank! [gunshot] [screaming] [crying] Frank! You're starting to remember shooting Sarah. [door creaks open] [rifle re loads] [crying and screaming] What have you done? You took Tasha. [screaming] [gunshot] No! No. Sorry it had to be this way. You can remember trying to shoot me... [gunshot] [screaming] [thud] Oh my god, no, no! -Sorry it had to be this way. [rifle reloading] -No! [rifle clicks] -[rifle clicking] -God dammit. [growling] You remember, chasing me through the woods? It's how you hit your head. -How can you know that? -Because I saw it. [heart beating] [heart beat continues] [ominous music] [thud] You're starting to remember. No.... no this isn't true. [reflective music] [reflective music continues] Natasha. Frank? Oh Jesus. [tragic music] I did this. [crying] [crying continues] I did this. Why didn't you tell me? Because I thought you'd try and kill me again. I couldn't have done this, but now I'm thinking I did. [Andy] I told you. [whispers] Frank... tell me where she is? I'm sorry. [crying] I’m sorry, I don't know. -You still don't remember? -[Frank] I really don't know. Frank, please, I am begging you here. Just tell me where she is? [Andy] Frank! Let's go to the cabin. I need to see what I did. Ok, let's go. [unsettling music] What were you doing out here anyway? I told you, you were trying to kill me, so I was running. Yeah, I got that. -I meant before. -Huh? Before. What do you mean? Before it went down, I mean, the way your story plays out, I took Natasha and then killed the others. Where were you? I was out for a walk. Yeah, you said that too, but why? Who goes out for a stroll and leaves his woman behind with a stranger. -What are you saying, Frank? -I'm just trying to make sense of it all. -Are you calling me a coward? -I didn't say that. I'm not a coward. Your word... not mine. Why did you leave her? -I didn't leave her. -You did. Shut up, alright. You left her behind. I'm not a coward. [dark reflective music] [Kurt] Looks like you're about to lose your woman. What did you just say? -Hey, take it easy, it's a fucking joke. -Well, it's not fucking funny. -What do you know, huh? -What? -What do you know? -[Kurt] Hey, settle down. [Kurt] You're acting like a maniac. -I'm sorry. -Who is that guy? I don't know. But they do look awful chummy. -Kurt. -I'm just saying... So, you're saying that you left because of me. Not exactly. Well, she wasn't too happy about something. Yeah, you. -What the hell was that? -It was nothing. -It didn't look like nothing. -What the hell is that supposed to mean? -Who is he? -He's from the office. -I know that, but who is he? -He's Frank ok, that's it, Frank from the office. Jesus, you're not jealous of him too? Ok, you've really gotta get this under control. Well, maybe you shouldn't be so friendly with everybody. Whatever. You fucked him, didn't you? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say it like that... -Just go take a walk. -Baby? Just go. He better not be here when I get back. Now, can we please just get back to the cabin, I don't want to hear you talking about her anymore, I don't like it. Yeah, whatever you say. [eerie music] [eerie music continues] I've been here before. Where's Natasha? I've been here. -Let's go you two, I wanna be drunk by noon. -Such class. I'll be sure to do the shots with my pinky extended. [giggling] Oh, such class. I've really been looking forward to this weekend. I just... I just saw her. I saw you too. What was I doing? Just you... and Natasha. And? And? Frank? And you had your arms around her. It makes no sense. What makes no sense, Frank? I could see her, you know, I could see her talking to me. It's your obsession, Frank. Now, where is she? Where is she? I swear to you Andy, I don't know. It's all I can remember. It's just that... this place, it's a... this place... it's so familiar. [reflective music] I remember seeing you inside. [reflective music continues] -I think you should tell him to leave. -Who? Oh no, it's Andy, that guy from work that I told you about. What the hell is he doing here, he's not planning on staying, is he? I mean this is couples weekend. You were just inside... you were watching us. I told you to stop with the us shit. Sorry. Let's go back in. Well, maybe she's out here somewhere. No, I looked. Let's go inside, Frank, maybe something will click, when you see what you did. I think that maybe we should call for some help. That would be a great idea, if you hadn't cut the phone lines. -Come on, Frank, let's go. -Ok. Sorry... I... I need a sec. Let's go. [ominous music] We have to go upstairs. [ominous music continues] I was here. I remember. [rapid heartbeat] [tragic music] [tragic music continues] You did this. Can't be. Don't even think about it. Besides it's jammed, that's why you tossed it. That's how I got away. Got away? Well you didn't shoot me anyway. Yeah. Right. [sighs] He'll get over it, they all do. [laughing] [door creaks open] Andy? [rifle loading] [gunshots] [screaming] Oh my god, this is insane. Yes it is. Now think, Frank. What happened? Think Frank. [gunshot] Oh Jesus, oh God, no! Sorry it had to be this way. [rifle re loading] [rifle clicking] [frustrated screaming] [frustrated scream and thud] What is it? [dark music] I can see it... And? And it was... it was awful. [sighs heavily] [eerie music] Oh my God, I did this. Yes... yes you did. Those poor people. I... I didn't see the woman, in the photo. Natasha. My wife. Your wife? Right... where's your wedding ring? -I don't know, I don't wear one. -You don't know or you don't? I don't wear one. Neither did Natasha. Did? Does. -Fuck, where is she? -Just, just... What? I see something. Is it Natasha? Let's go outside. Is that where Natasha is? Yes. Ok, let's go. Ok, let's go. [thump] [thud] [crashing] [thump] [glass smashing] [thumping] [banging] [thump] [table smashing] [rapid breathing] Ok. Ok. Take me to her! Take me to her... now! [rapid breathing continues] Happy now, Andy, huh? You got what you want. Finish us both off and just be done with it. I just want to find Natasha. Sure. No witnesses, once you got me and Natasha, you're home free. Where are we going? Just a little further... we're almost there. [eerie music] [dark music] Yeah, go on and shoot me. [door creaks open] [crying] [rifle loading] -What have you done, Frank? -[Sarah] He took Natasha. He killed Kurt and he took Natasha. [screams] [gunshot] -Oh my God. -Sorry it had to be this way. [rifle re loading] [rifle clicks] [frustrated scream] [frustrated scream and thud] [tense music] Go on. Get revenge for your wife. How can you do that? Go on... shoot me. You don't have it in you, do you? Yeah, go on then, shoot me. [gun clicks] Hey, you alright, what's the rush? -I'm sorry, I need to go. -You mind explaining to me what it is you're running from? Ah... it's a... nothing, Sir, but I really have to go. [knife swishes and slashes] [thump] [knife twisting] [knife swishes] [gurgling] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshot] [gun clicking] You couldn't even protect your own wife. I think you should tell him to leave. Who? -He's my husband, Frank? -Yeah, well he didn't need to be here. Ok, you know what, you have to stop talking like this. What? Ok, I think you should leave. [eerie dark music] [gun clicking] [ominous music] You fucked him, didn't you? -I'm sorry, I didn't mean... -Just go take a walk. [rifle loading] [suspenseful music] Natasha? [suspenseful music continues] [gunshot] [gun clicking] Didn't check it, did you? You even know how? [knife clicks] Remember... I had that gun first. Was this a fucking game, huh? [Natasha crying] Come on, let's go. No, no, no... where, where? With me, come on, we're leaving together. I'm not going anywhere with you, Frank You know that. -Why not? -Just let me go. Because of him? [crying] -Just please let me go. -Because of him? Why do you care so much about him? I'm sorry.... I'm sorry, ok? Why do you care so much about him? Please don't hurt him, Frank, don't hurt Andy, please? -I am begging you, please? -Tasha... Tasha, please. Come on. Don't you want to be with me? -Tasha, we were so great together. -Frank, it was office flirting, it was one kiss, it was a mistake, I love my husband, I'm sorry that it happened, I am so sorry. Wait a second... a mistake? -I'm a fucking mistake? -No Frank, that's not what I meant. -Then I'm not a mistake, am I? -[whispers] No. -Am I! -No. I'm sorry. [crying] -Then leave with me, now. -[Screaming] Stop it! You've known all along, haven't you? -You've known all along, haven't you? -Well, not the whole time. [dark music] Let's go. [turbulent music] [knife slashes] [spraying blood] -[choking] -Tasha, Tasha, stop it. Shh, shh. [gasping] Tell me you love me. [gasping] Tell me you love me and mean it. [gasping and choking] [shallow breathing] [blood bubbling] [dark music]
