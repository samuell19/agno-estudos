The original reels of The Siege of the Alcazar have suffered from many cuts, changes and poor preservation over the years. After the war, the Italian censors made drastic changes in order to delete all scenes in which Republican combatants appeared too cruel and which showed strong Italian support for the Nationalists. This reconstruction of the original version demanded a lot of work and was made possible only by using material from German, Spanish and English copies which were indispensable for integrating the missing parts. A careful digital restoration of image and sound was made by our technicians, returning the film to its complete state, perhaps for the first time in sixty years. This film aims to bring to life on the screen the spirit of the heroic defenders of the Alcazar fortress in Toledo during the famous siege from July to September 1936. The characters portrayed are modeled on the real heroism of those who lived the extraordinary story from their leader Colonel Moscardo to each humble and unknown Falangist. All stories that form the basis of this epic are reconstructions based on interviews and documents of absolute historical accuracy. THE SIEGE OF THE ALCAZAR Company: Attention! Eyes left! Stand at ease! Tonight we'll be in Madrid - Maybe we can have a little fun. Madrid may not be as amusing as you think, these days. What are you two talking about? About leave, sir. Which train are you taking? - The one at three p.m. Then we'll be traveling together. I'll see you at the station. Great! Now we'll even have to behave on the train! I see the commander coming. Quick, straighten your belt! Nothing new at the Alcazar, sir. Attention! Cadets, I didn't come here today just to say goodbye before you take your leave I also came to greet you and to recall the words spoken by Charles the Fifth: "lf in combat you see my horse and my flag fall" "then raise my flag before you tend to me!" Boys! In all circumstances of your life never forget that before every- thing else comes the flag! The symbol of your fatherland. Conchita! Conchita! Carmen! I kept my promise. - You'll stay the whole month? Only three weeks. That's all I could manage. My mothers a real taskmaster! Thank you. - You're welcome. You seduced a guy? - Two guys, darling! The first got off before Toledo. How's your aunt? Still sick? Still the same. Let the luggage rest a bit! Why? We're not going straight home? I want to say goodbye to someone. - Who'? I bet it's Francesco. - Sure! There's never anyone else. Am I late? - A little. It's Paolo's fault. He's such a snail! Who's that pretty girl? - A friend of mine. Introduce me, then! - ls there anything I don't do for you? Carmen! Carmen, allow me to introduce you! - Your fiancée? Sorry, no. I'm not the happy man. I'm Paolo Montez, this is the fiancée. We finally meet! I've heard so much about you. I've wanted to meet you since forever Unfortunately, I'm all there is. I hope you're not disappointed. - You'll do just fine. Pardon. I need coins for the newspaper. Can you change 25 pesetas? Right away, Captain. Let me introduce you, sir! Miss Conchita Alvarez, my fiancée. Pleased to meet you, miss Carmen Herrera just arrived from Madrid. Here you are, Captain. - Thank you, Mantel. Glad to have met you, ladies. Now please excuse me! See you on the train. Nice guy. - The finest officer in the Academy Certainly a fine looking man. - That's not what we meant. By “fine" we meant "a first-rate soldier". A determined man, who knows his profession. At the Academy, we admired him above everyone else. TODAY, C. SOTELO, HEAD OF THE OPPOSITION, WILL GIVE A SPEECH 300 dead and 2000 wounded! And hundreds of strikes. Riots, looting, destruction every- where! Deputy Calvo Sotelo after uttering words about things which haven't happened you'll be solely responsible if they do occur. I have broad shoulders. And I do not shy away from responsibility for my actions I also accept the responsibility for others as long as their actions are for the benefit of my country. Let me cite the words of St. Do- mingo de Silos to his king: "Sire! "You can take my life, but nothing more. "Because death with glory is better than a life with shame." You dog. - Wretch! Crook! Death! Death! Death! Now, the destiny of our country no longer rests here but in the street! CALVO SOTELO HAS SIGNED HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT THE SUDDEN DEATH OF C. SOTELO. DISFIGURED BODY FOUND. THE FUNERAL OF THE ASSASSINATED C. SOTELO IS TOMORROW. As God hears us and sees us, we swear to imitate your example We will avenge your death and save the country! We swear! The forces in Africa are in rebellion against the government. This is a local incident without importance The government is in control of the situation. Another local incident! It can spread to all Spain in no time. - You exaggerate! Are you leaving? - Yes, and you're leaving with me. Where to? - To the Captain. After news like this, we should report in to him. Waiter! The news is true? - True indeed. A large number of Moroccan troops has landed at Algeciras. I'll tell you more, but you'll have to keep it a secret Italy's supporting this rebellion. Do you know who moved those troops from Africa to Spain? Transport planes from Italy This is an established fact, which will give you an idea of what's going to happen in the near future What is it? - Captain, two cadets are asking for you. Let them in! Come in! Ah, it's you! So, what is it? We heard the news on the radio, so we came to receive orders. I'm off for Toledo. You two are on leave, so We'll do as you do, Captain. Our duty now is to be at the Alcazar. I appreciate this. Follow me to Toledo, agreed? - Agreed, Captain! Good morning, gentlemen. Staff officers, report! Gentlemen, as you have learned from the news on the radio the death of Calvo Sotelo has been the signal for a movement intended to save the country. The initiative for the conquest of the country was taken by General Franco. The officials and officers are on his side as well as all those who still believe in the future of Spain. We have waited a long time for this day. It has come. Now we need to act! I ask every one of you to give his opinion on the matter. Follow Franco! - Follow Franco! Franco! - Follow Franco! Follow Franco! - Follow Franco! Follow Franco! - Follow Franco! Follow Franco! I'm happy to see that your opinion is the same as mine. At this moment, the destiny of Spain is in the hands of those who are prepared to give their life to save her The rebellion is now controlled by government forces, who, backed by public opinion will put an end to all outbreaks of rebellion. Calm now reigns throughout Spain. And now some dance music. Move away from the window, please! It's dangerous in times like these! It would no doubt be best, if I returned to Madrid. I'm afraid it's like this all over now, my dear. Hello? Francesco? Are you calling from Toledo? What? You're back? Alright. I see Don't worry! We won't leave the house. We'll await instructions from you. Bye! It was Francisco. Francesco called. He says, we shouldn't worry The military's controlling Toledo Order will soon be reestablished. I'm off to Madrid. - Impossible! Why? - The trains aren't running Even if you were able to find one that was, you might not make it home! What should I do, then? - Francisco told us not to move. You'll see everything will end soon The Civil Guard is already at the Alcazar. Unload this as fast as you can! All is well? - Yes, Colonel. I brought the ammunition without any difficulties, sir. A million cartridges? - Yes, sir. Hello. One moment. The War Ministry wants to speak to you, Colonel. We requested ammunition be sent over Nothing's arrived yet. Has it been sent? We didn't send it, because we need it here. D0 you realize this is insubordi- nation! With all due respect, I must say I can't deliver arms and ammo to someone who'll use it against Spain. - As you wish. You know Toledo is only 43 miles from Madrid. If you persist in this attitude, we'll come and get them by force! Do as you like, sir! Gentlemen, you heard. They asked me to hand over arms to the enemies of Spain I refused. I think, I acted on behalf of everyone here. We're all with you. Now we must be prepared for anything. Madrid will send troops and planes against us. - We will resist! We'll resist any attack at the gates of Toledo! The Tavera hospital. - Exactly. The Tavera hospital towers above the street that gives access to the city. You shall take over its defense. Thank you. But I can only give you a few men and not much in the way of arms. - It'll have to do. The commander of Toledo has issued the following order: "Art. 1°: A state of siege is pro- claimed for the Toledo region." "Art. 2°: Everyone opposed to this order"will be judged by a council of war Who is it? It's me. Open up! Hurry! Take everything you can and come with me! Where? - To the Alcazar. We're in a state of siege! The town is no longer safe. - My God! Don't be afraid! But how will I take all my dresses with me? You won't need them. It'll just be for a few days What about auntie? She's ill! She'll oome with us. Go on, do as I say! How are you feeling, aunt? - Good. It's a little damp. And it's very crowded here. Don't worry, ma'am. It's just for two or three days. I brought you my spring mattress. I hope you'll dream about me. Why did they put us in these horrible cellars? Isn't there another place in all of Alcazar? Yes, but not as safe. - I'd prefer the danger. How can I sleep in such a crowd? Can't you find a screen for me? A screen? Yes, perhaps in the physics lab. Good, go fetch it! - This is the third errand you've made me run! I hope, it's the last. Some men would agree to walk around the world for me. But they haven't done so til now! - Smartass! Paolo! Can't you find me a softer pillow as well? This isn't a pillow. It's a rock. I'll have it stuffed with swansdown. Three guns for Revenga; and 35 for Captain Casale And the automatic rifles? 10 for the defense of the Alcazar and 3 for external defense. Captain, I need your help. What's wrong? - I've been put together with all the others. Where do you want to be placed? - I want some privacy. Privacy? This isn't a hotel. Well, let's see where you've been put. Here it is. - And you're complaining? You've been spoiled, miss Sorry, but this spring mattress will have to go back. What? You're taking it from me? We've very few of them. They're reserved for the hospital So you want me to sleep on this dirty floor? Like everyone else, miss. And you'll have to share your mattress with another woman. That's the last straw! I'd never have come, had I known. I'd have gone back to Madrid at any cost. I don't think that would've been such a bad idea. Here's the pillow! I haven't found a screen yet. Did you bring this bed here? - Yes, sir. Bring it back to where it came from. - Yes captain sir. Bastard! - He's not so willing to walk around the world for you, huh? Halt! MOW.! MOW.! Calm down! Calm down! Auntie! Carmen! Carmen! - Conchita! I'm afraid! There seems to be a lot of them - About 4,000. And we're only 60. Good odds! - But they won't pass. Don't fire until they're close! Good. - We don't have much ammunition. Make every shot count! - Understood. Don't shoot! Nobody fire! Nobody fire! Aliaga! Commander. - Relocate the machine guns! The first remains here; the second to the third window in the back. Move this gun, too! To the second window! I was wrong; try to cover on the left. Fire! Impossible to advance on the streets near the hospital. We must demand larger artillery from Madrid You ask them! - Yes sir. Won't be so easy a business. The hospital has an exceptional strategic position and the defenders fight well. They can't resist more than 24 hours. The hospital isn't a fortress. Its walls aren't strong enough. Hello. - How are things going, Villanova? Enemy pressure is very strong, but we're carrying on, sir. If you give up, Toledo is lost. Nobody is passing now and nobody will be passing. Keep me advised! - Understood, Colonel. Armored cars! How many? - I spotted three. We must stop them! Quick! The hand grenades! The air force! To the yard, quick! Hey, you! Call the others; have them come here right away! Hello? Major Villanova? One moment. Villanova, what's the situation? They want to cut us off with artillery fire. We can't get sufficient food and ammunition. The roads to Toledo are all under enemy fire. But our morale is good and we'll resist. I expect nothing less from you! I know you'll resist. My regards to all of you and may luck be on your side! The situation's bleak. They can't hold out much longer. Hello? Colonel, sir, it's the Chief of Staff. Hello! - Moment. General, sir. Good evening, Colonel. Please listen closely! I'm speaking to you as a friend, not as your commander. I understand your attitude but it will lead to a disaster. You cannot resist Surrender! - No, we won't surrender! It's for our and General Franco's Spain. Franco won't be joining you there! My advice is to surrender. Nothing will happen to you, my word of honor. Like me, you were trained at this academy Have you forgotten what the honor of an officer is? We won't surrender. We won't be the first to show Alcazar what cowardice is! He won't surrender! - He's mad! Who's to decide, who's mad? THE CIVIL HOSPITAL HAS FALLEN. REPUBLICAN TROOPS ENTER TOLEDO. THE REBELS ARE EN- TRENCHED INSIDE THE ALCAZAR You still believe they'll shell the Alcazar without hesitation? If they hesitate to do so, it won't have anything to do with respect for a monument They'll attack without mercy. We must prepare as best we can for a siege. Food supplies? - Not good, Colonel. Just enough for the children and the wounded. And there are 2,000 people here. I didn't expect there'd be so many 125 officers. 1,000 men of the Civil Guard; the troops and the Academy. And 200 falangists and civilians. - A village in itself, Colonel. Francisco Will you be away much longer'? - Only a few minutes. Wait for me! I've never seen you so happy. And at a time like this! I know, nobody knows how it'll end Still, so help me God I'm so happy. You see, I want to live where he lives. If you only knew what is to see him; talk to him every day. You'll know, when you fall in love. I've been in love often - But never in a serious way That's different. Real love changes everything. One feels happy, confident - Nonsense! Love just means finding a man interesting, my dear. That's what it meant to me up to now. - And that's changed? No. But - But? Just a moment. Hello, Captain. - Hello, miss. Can I tell you something? - Of course. I know you took part in the defense of the hospital. It must've been terrible. - Yes, they made us pull out. You must have a bad opinion of me. - Why? Because of what I said the other day I'm the lady, who was looking for privacy. Ah! I'd forgotten. - Your opinion is very important. You're not like other people. Oh, I'm just a soldier; sometimes a rude one. Would you do me a favor'? Help me become a nurse! At the hospital You? A nurse? - I'm a trained nurse I became one on a whim to get closer to a doctor I liked Let's hope that's changed. - But I want to be a real nurse now Sitting around makes you think - I think so, too. The artillery's firing perfectly, General. I'll report to Madrid. Tell me, when can the infantry attack and exterminate these rebels? For now we'll leave the action to the artillery. General, we received a phone call saying everything's ready. Comrade commissar, we're having a feast in your honor in Toledo. Very nice, let's go! The guns can continue firing on their own. They don't need us. - True. Food is important, too. These bishops had magnificent facilities. I chose this Archdiocese as a headquarters because it's quite pleasing. I even left all the sacred images hanging on the walls. They're decorative! True. Officers and friends! You've accomplished a great task! Toledo, the cradle of Spanish civilization, has been liberated. The triumph will be complete with the conquest of the Alcazar At this moment, the mighty voice of the cannons that accompany our dinner assures us that this last relic of this fascist infection will be obliterated I am alluding to those few men, dominated by the madness of a traitor They've locked themselves inside the walls of Alcazar hoping that our respect for a monument of art will save them. We should, indeed, respect works of art Our general here did so by leaving these disgusting religious paintings in here But faced with a human life, no work of art has value Alcazar is irrelevant. If every work of art must disappear in order to crush the fascists we will build new monuments even greater. So let us toast our civilization! - Bravo! Incredible. Five hours of intense shelling and the Alcazar still stands. Medieval walls were constructed thicker than those made today I have to conclude that the artillery is impotent. No, but it will take time and effort. Madrid should send us heavier artillery! You speak as if we had time to lose. You obviously don't realize that the proletariat needs a victory. We announced to the world that the capture of the Alcazar was only a question of hours. If the artillery can't do the job why not send in the infantry! What are you waiting for? How will they be able to pass without a breach? Commissar, if the artillery can't open breaches, we won't be able to assault the fortress What do I tell Madrid then? And the press? What is it? Is it true? - Yes sir. Where did they catch him? - Here, in Toledo. Have you told the chief of the militia? - No sir. Inform him right away! - Yes sir. You can send a message to Madrid announcing that the Alcazar will be in our hands tonight What? The Alcazar is ours? - Without a single shot! Without the loss of a single man! Three dead - And six wounded. Doctor! - What is it? I'll be right there Lieutenant Glauso, 3 guards, Fernandez, Rodriguez. Good. A soldier, Vincenzo Moreno, Antonio Suarez. Badly wounded? None. - Thanks, doctor. Hello. - Hello. Captain! - Oh, it's you I'm here thanks to your intervention. If I'd known sooner, I'd have asked the doctor for you. To know, whether I did my duty? I have no doubts about that. You look tired. Take a rest! - I'm not tired. There's always lots to do. - Unfortunately. Do you think this will go on much longer? They'll try everything to make us surrender. But we won't! - Your spirits are high You're not scared of the bombs any more? - Much less than before. Soon, I'll be like you. I'm trying to follow your example when it comes to being courageous. You seem another woman than the one I met a few days ago. I am. I'm trying to forget the woman I was. And I want you to do likewise. The electricity and water have been cut. Two bad blows. We have water in the underground wells but without electricity, the radio's dead. We'll have to fight without news from the outside. - We can and will resist, Colonel. - Thank you, I know. The Alcazar keeps on resisting. Its walls and its defenders resist. Even the women, after short fits of panic, stay calm. God help us, nothing will force us to give up! Hello? It's for you, Colonel. This is the commander of the Republican forces in Toledo. I demand the immediate surrender of the Alcazar I'll give you ten minutes to surrender. After that, we'll shoot your son, who's in our hands. You don't think me capable of such a thing? We'll let you talk to him. Dad. - What's going on, son? They're going to shoot me, if you don't surrender. But don't worry about me! If they do shoot you, die like a good Christian. And a patriot. Shout: "Long live Christ" And "Long live Spain!" I will, dad. Goodbye, my son! - Goodbye, dad. Five of the ten minutes are gone. What's your decision? I make you a present of the remaining five. Attention, attention! Stop obeying your disloyal leaders! Pass over to our side! We won't shoot you. We'll welcome you as brothers. Surrender! For us at the Alcazar, the word "surrender" doesn't exist! Hey there! You at the defense, answer! Is Fernando Ramirez there? Answer! Fernando! They're calling you! Hey there! Answer! Tell him to come to the window so that his wife may talk to him! C'mon! - Fernando! Fernando! Clara! - Don't trust them! Clara, what's up? How are you? - She greets you and is great! You have a beautiful wife, Fernando! Beast! Every man to his place! Bring the sandbags here! Take him to the infirmary! Sister, I need this bandaged. - Go to the young lady over there! Which one? - That one over there. Was'? What a surprise! You as my nurse! I learned not to be surprised by anything anymore. What happened? - I'm hurt. Can you bandage it? Strange we hadn't met till now. I've been stuck in here since the beginning. Too tight? - No, it's the splinter that hurts. How did you get that? You'll never believe it. Atango was at fault. A tango? - Yes, one of the Red militiamen was whistling a tango out of tune this morning. I wanted to teach him a lesson and to thank me Bang! But I can thank him now, because I got to see you. You're still the same! - How happy I am to find you! - Me too. - Remember our last dance in Madrid? You had a dress of pink tulle that I really liked. Your friend, the doctor, was there too. He was very jealous Didn't leave you for a moment. Not too tight? - No, it's good. But I would've done the same. It was the evening of our first kiss. Pedro, please - What? Those are memories. Captain, it's not as bad as it seems. - Thank goodness. I heard you're hurt. - A trifle. Let's bandage it! - Thanks, it's nothing. Go distribute these! The Alcazar is finished! The Alcazar is finished! Latest edition! Alcazar is finished! Latest edition! Wait a minute! The Alcazar is finished! Latest edition! GENERAL NEWS Thank you for bringing dinner; I'm hungry. - Today mule, no horses It's a noble animal as well. No, the difference between the two is that the horse neighs in the stomach, while the mule kicks! Bless you, for still being able to joke! Mom, bread, bread. - Here, here. They're always hungry and they've cut rations again I don't care about the meat; but the bread For two days, we haven't eaten so they could have some food. If they cut the rations again, what will I give them? And what shall I give this creature? Since yesterday, I have no milk. The stores are all empty. I've cut back on the consumption of flour but when there's nothing left, there's nothing left. What little remains of coffee and potatoes is reserved for the sick. There are still mules and horses Even that's decreasing. Even if we proceed to cut con- sumption, if we don't get more food in here, it won't last long So, that's how it looks? - You wanted the truth! If God doesn't help, we'll soon be starving. I must speak to the Colonel. - He's busy; come again later! I need to talk with him now! If he knew the news I bring he would surely meet me. - And what is this news? Bread! Bread? - Yes, bread There is grain in the storehouses of the Agricultural Bank. It's the grain that farmers gave as collateral for loans. One of them is very near the Alcazar. Do you realize the importance of what you are saying? If what you say isn't true - It's true, Colonel. I saw them unloading it in the magazines. It may be there's none left, but I don't think so. Very well. Tonight, a patrol will go there. And you will guide them! - Yes sir, Colonel. If it's true, God has come to our rescue. Nothing. Madrid, always Madrid. - We should be able to get a foreign station! The batteries are charged. Let's give it another try! Everything's in order. Let's change to be sure! Listen! Bastards! The little bastards! Keep listening! Where's the Colonel? - He'll be here soon. What's happened? - Very serious news. If Madrid is broadcasting it, I wouldn't worry. A lot of lies. This too is a big lie. But listen to what they said! "The Alcazar rebels have been arrested by government troops" "The officers and cadets have been disarmed and marched out." "The situation in Toledo is now completely calm." We're cut off here from the rest of Spain. If our troops believe Madrid, they won't come to Toledo and liberate We must inform them! I will ask the colonel to send me to General Franco! Radio Madrid announced that the Alcazar has surrendered. What? - Read my notes! There are no limits to their lies. Colonel, I request permission to try and penetrate the enemy's lines tonight to tell General Franco the truth? That we haven't surrendered, but continue to fight? I want to go, too, Colonel. Thank you, but that's a one-man job. The risk will be smaller and you'll be more likely to make it. We need a man in good shape, who's intrepid and very familiar with the countryside In that case, I think I'm most qualified, Colonel. I think so, too. - Thank you, Colonel. Do you have a plan? - The simplest there is I'll take the documents and uniform of a prisoner. - Good. You can go; all is quiet. - And the guards? They've been informed I truly look like a militiaman. - You could make a career of it! Could you do me a favor, commander This ring If I fail to come back - What are you saying? - I'll get back. But you never know. If we don't meet again, when you get out of here If we do! You're sure to get out. Give this ring to my wife and tell her to say a prayer for me! Goodbye. See you soon! - Break a leg! Mom! Mom! Someone doesn't want to sleep. Like you. - Right. A night owl like me. I never go to bed before dawn. And sometimes, I even go to work when the sun rises. Say, did you ever fall in love afterwards ...? - Afterwards? After having finished with a girl. No, that's surely not pleasant. - You realize too late that you've been a fool and understood nothing. And what you've lost - Whom are you speaking of? Nobody. I can't sleep. Thinking of him? - Why has he changed? We used to meet, we talked He's very busy. - I know. Still, he always made a quick visit to the hospital. Don't fool yourself! He came out of duty, not to entertain you. Or did he discuss personal things with you? No, never. No, but I felt that he came because I was there. That can't be explained. I'll explain it: You're really in love And I thought you were never serious; incapable of love. Less serious than you imagine. I never realized, but in here I understand. Let's hope he'll be back tomorrow. Why, where is he? - You don't know? Francisco didn't tell you? - No. What happened? Vela ordered an excursion tonight. The cadets accompanied him. Francisco was with them. I heard it at the hospital. Dear God! What for? They're trying to get some grain. Holy Virgin! Protect them! Quick! You tied the rope? Yes. Guys! There's grain! Grain! Guys! Tomorrow we'll be eating! Fill the sacks! Hi, fellas! Going to Talavera de Ia Reina? No, to Torrico. - Close enough. Can ljoin you? Sure. What are you doing in Talavera? - I'm off to see my girl. You're on leave? - Yes, for ten days. Lucky you. That Alcazar keeps us busy. We take care of the shells for the artillery. Two trips a day! Perhaps more now. Tomorrow, they're going to start shelling day and night! At night? How? - By using searchlights. I saw them put them up on the houses around Alcazar. So the shelling won't stop. - I already stopped sleeping. What we need is more artillery. Artillery? If I had my way, I'd do it more effectively! Some poison gas and the Alcazar would go down, men and mice. Wonder if we'll do that someday. Why not now? We should reconnect the Alcazar's water pipes. They'd be able to drink again. But with poisoned water, the drinker croaks! And that way the "liberation" would come true! Giovanni, a drink for a militiaman on leave! How are you, Captain? - Are you talking to me? Yes, to you! How are you? - Are you making a joke, friend? I'm not a captain. - You don't remember me? This is the first time I've met you. - Just a moment. Even if you don't remember me, I remember you. You're Captain Vincenzo Alba. - Captain? Just like you're a general. My name is José Fernéndez, look at my papers! Papers, schmapers! You're Captain Alba I recognize you. And you remember me. I was a recruit in your company. In the 7th infantry regiment in Madrid. You don't know what you're saying, nut job! Tell the truth! Friends, this isn't a militiaman! He's a spy! If you have any last wishes, perhaps I can fulfill them. Between old comrades in arms. We“ then Bun voyage. Ready! Fire! Those guns make a lot of noise! We used to be able to listen in at night. But now, not even that is possible anymore. But I ought to succeed sometime I wish it were over. - Don't be afraid, calm down! Everything will be fine. - Hope so hope so Rafael! Rafael, it's a boy! - A boy! Yes. a boy! Handsome? - Very. Where is he? I want to see him. The mother wants to see the boy. Bring him over here. Maria, look! How cute he is! We'll call him Francisco after General Franco, okay? A Pencil! I've got a foreign station. Italy! Radio Milano, finally! Write! "The campaign of the Nationalist forces in Spain proceeds success- fully." "The army of the south has taken Badajoz" "Troops under Colonel Yage" "are marching towards Toledo!" Our troops! Advancing! General Franco is marching on Toledo! We heard it on the radio! Our guys are marching on Toledo! #Cara al sol con Ia camisa nueva que tu bordaste en rojo ayer# #me hallara Ia muerte si me lleva y note vuelvo a ver.# #Formare junto a mis companeros que hacen guardia sobre Ios lucer0s# #impasible el ademan, y estan presentes en nuestro afan.# #Si te dicen que cai, me fui al puesto que tengo alli.# #Volveran banderas# Long live Spain! Our guys are coming! Long live Spain! Carmen! Embrace me! We'll be free and able to go to Madrid! - Freedom, in Madrid! Carmen! #Cara al sol con Ia camisa nueva que tu bordaste en rojo ayer# #me hallara Ia muerte si me Ileva y no te vuelvo a ver.# #Formare junto a mis companeros que hacen guardia sobre Ios lucer0s# #impasible el ademan, y estan presentes en nuestro afan.# #Si te dicen que cai, me fui al puesto que tengo alli.# #Volveran banderas victoriosas al paso alegre de Ia paz# #y traeran prendidas cinco rosas: Ias flechas de mi haz.# #Volvera a reir la primavera.# "We know about your heroic resistance" "and we are preparing to give you our help" "We will soon be with you. Keep up resistance at all cost!" "Here's some small relief" GENERAL FRANCO No, we're not ready yet; it's work that takes time. Hopefully soon. We've been going on for a month. No doubt. You can assure the Minister of that I'm sure of the results. Alright. We'll speed up. Bye. They're losing patience in Madrid by the day They think taking the Alcazar is indispensable to winning the war. Naturally, because the others are advancing. If not stopped, they'll be here in 10 days. They'll never get here in time. It'll be over by then. To think, that inside I feel bad about the women and children. They're there! - No. They're there! There's a noise. - Where? In here! There's a noise in the wall. - Where? In here. What's everybody doing at the wall? There's a noise! Where? In here. There really is a noise! - A noise? What is it? - A noise. A strange noise. - What can it be? The stones are shaking. It's a continual noise, as if from a machine. Excuse me! You can hear the noise there. - Silence, please. What is it? - Nothing. What's happening? - They're trying to blow us up. Two tunnels. At two different points. There's no doubt, Colonel. The noise comes from drilling. They're resorting to dynamite, because they can't capture us with guns. Killing women and children! - They're not soldiers; they're murderers! Cowards! - Bastards! Gentlemen, calm down. Where can the noise be heard? - In the southwest cellar. The tunnels of the mines start in the houses near here. I can't say exactly where but I think they run in this direction. This is the enclosure of the Alcazar. Here is the southwest cellar. The tunnels ought to go from this point and by going through here, arrive at these two points. Is the danger imminent? - Not yet. The noise is still far off The tunnels aren't finished yet. It will take four or five more days for them to finish. And to think that help is perhaps ten days away! Can you tell me, where they are? Not more than 100 meters from here, I think. When will you know where the start of the two tunnels are? I can tell you tonight, Colonel. - Good. As the head of the citizens I advise, that you clear out the houses next to the tunnel. Transfer the women and the children to the northeast cellars! Arrange for a platoon of volunteers to destroy the entrances to the tunnels. Auntie's asleep - She's worn out. Poor thing. All this pressure at her age. You have water? - Yes. Give me some! - What for? I want to wash my face. - There'll be less to drink. I prefer being thirsty to feeling dirty. Well seen him? No. What are you waiting for? - I'm afraid of what he might say. I wouldn't know how to start and I'm afraid of the answer. I'm intimidated and can't act. What? You? Afraid of a man? Seems strange, right? I, who laughed at such things. It was easy when nothing made me feel like that. And now! - There will be plenty of time, if we survive. And if we die instead ...? - Have you lost all hope? God could not allow the death of so many innocent people. We'll be saved. Francisco also said we'll be saved. Francisco and I are going to marry when we get out. When Francisco's an officer we'll live in Madrid. Think about it: Madrid! - Madrid! What's become of everyone I knew there? Don't worry, I'm sure they're doing fine. I hope so. What time is it? - It must be around ten. It's late, I must go. - Bye. Hello. Hello, Pedro. I'd like to speak with you. - I'm late. Just five minutes, please. Don't say no. Will you marry me? Don't you feel well? - I feel fine. Will you? - Now, at death's door'? Arm in arm with you, I'll be more welcome in Heaven. Answer! Will you marry me or not? - Marry? Why not? What's wrong? So many people marry! Now that Spain needs new Spaniards marriage is an act of patriotism! Can't you be serious for a moment? You wouldn't believe me. If I told you that this climate has changed me; that I'm not the man I once was If I can get out alive from these glorious walls I will remain changed for life. Would you believe me then? I'd believe you. I believe you now. So let's marry. - No, Pedro. That's nonsense. We avoided it a year ago when I wanted to and you didn't and this time we'll avoid it, too. What's his name? Who? I know you. If you're speaking like that, it's because you love someone else. It's Captain Vela, right? - Yes. You like him a lot? - I love him. I got to know him here. I started to love him here. Perhaps I'll leave here without having spoken to him and telling him, how much I love him. You say that with bitterness. - With regret, Pedro. Just one day of happiness is all I wanted. Nobody's missing? - No, Captain. How many are we? - Forty. Does everyone have a hand grenade? - Yes, Captain. Good. Don't let them see my arm! Attention! At ease! - At ease! Our fate depends on the success of your action. Franco's troops are in the Toledo province. You're off to destroy the entrances to the tunnels to stop our enemies from blowing us up and to hold them back while our troops advance to liberate us Good luck! Can we go, Colonel, sir? - Yes. Go on, boys! With five men, there! Where did they get you? - In the belly. Go on! I'll have you brought back. - One moment, Captain. I need to speak to you. - Quick, what is it? I can't breathe. Thank you. Carmen, you know - Who? Carmen Herrera? Give my greetings to Carmen! She loves you. I'm telling you this, because she never will. Marry her! That's good advice. The best I ever gave in my life. Captain! A very serious abdominal wound. First sortie for the tunnel! Perforated lung, serious business. Third sortie for the tunnel! Useless sacrifices The tunnel's still there. - We had to try. We did our best; but now, there's nothing we can do. Attention, Alcazar! Will you receive our messenger? Colonel, the enemy is sending a messenger. I repeat: Alcazar! Again. Will you receive our messenger to negotiate with the Alcazar's commander'? Tell them to send him over! - A megaphone! - What time? Tomorrow, from 9:00 to 10:00, conditioned upon a cease fire Yes sir. The Colonel will receive your representative Tomorrow, from 9:00 to 10:00 Hostilities are to be suspended during negotiations Answer! Agreed. Our representative will appear at Cappuccini Place between 9:00 and 10:00. Hostilities will be suspended during this hour. Remove the blindfold! Colonel, sir - Be seated! I should like these two officers to be present during our oonver- sation, if you'll permit it. I'll allow it. What's your mission? By the authority of this paper, I have the authority to discuss the conditions of surrender. Cigarette? Long time since you had one? - Some time, yes. Keep them! We have plenty. Why not surrender? Resistance is suicidal. We don't agree. It's not ourjob to discuss these matters. The Colonel is discussing this with your superior right now. These are issues they?! decide on. This window is finally an ordinary window again You can watch freely. Look at the sky the fields! Breathe the fresh air without fear! Too beautiful to be true. Even the silence seems true. To think that in an hour hell will start again. Once I get out of here, I'll marry Conchita. We'll rent that cottage. On the Tago. Do you see it? You're not going to Madrid? - When I'm an officer. In the meantime, I'll stay here. For the moment, three rooms will do, as long as there are no kids. For me and Conchita, it will be more than enough. Francisco! Damn! They don't even respect the truce! I refuse! That's the answer. - Is that definite? Yes sir. Regretful. Now we'll be forced to use all means. I know, the mine. Tell everybody that we prefer the Alcazar become a cemetery rather than a pigsty. And the women and children? - If they should get out will they be allowed to go? - They will be freed immediately. Can you give me your word of honor that no retaliation will be made against them? That they will not be used? Let me know, without going into painful details if they will be used as elements for further persuasion? Then my mission is ended. Ended indeed. May I shake your hand, sir'? One thing! If you have a priest sentenced to death send him! We'll need him. I promise to do my best to grant your request I hope the mine explodes at night so I don't notice it. You? - Always the mine! An obsession! Don't you think about it? - Yes, but I don't rave on about it. Mom, is it true, that when we get home, you will buy me a gun? Yes, son. - And a box of soldiers? Yes, love. - A doll for me, mom! Yes. - Mom, when are we going home? Soon. The baby we were hoping for is here. And now - And now? A miracle will happen. I'm sure of it. You say that, but you don't believe it. He woke up. How do you feel? No change. He can't speak. Tell me the truth! What did the doctor say? No, I don't want to know. I know, it's serious. But there's hope, right? - Certainly! Relax. Still serious? - A matter of hours. His girl doesn't know? - She doesn't want to. She looks at him as if she's begging him not to die, poor thing. Francisco was her whole life. - Yes. When your whole existence is centered on one person, losing him is You have to have lived it in order to understand. You speak as if you'll lose someone dear. Yes, I'm afraid of losing you. - Me? Why do you say that? Because I love you. Vela, I beg you You have no idea what it means for me to hear you say this. It's true, Carmen. I love you. And I'd like to spend my whole life declaring it to the world How I've waited to hear those words! Now I feel that everything I did here every pain that I felt all I could do in here helped me earn this moment. No, it will be more than a moment. Death may be near, but a miracle may still happen. May God hear you! - God will hear me. Calling Alcazar! The priest you asked for is coming Thank you, father, for having come to bring us comfort in this moment. I fulfill my ministry with my entire Christian faith Even under these lay clothes. You will find the priestly vestments here. I have come to you to speak the word of God. They're needed in these supreme moments of preparation before your soul is to be handed over to him. He opens his arms and in his divine goodness, he absolves all your sins as you have forgiven the sins of others. In this concluding and heroic moment of your life turn away from earthly things and raise your spirit to the eternal truth. That of God. The short time accorded to me prevents me from listening to your individual confessions. I invite you to carry out an act of oontrition to prepare your souls for acquittal. Repeat after me: My Lord, Jesus Christ. Given the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves, I will absolve you collectively. For the repentance of your sins Ego vos absolvo a peccatis vostris in nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, amen. Colonel, where are the worst injured? The last six beds on the left. He wants to marry in extremis. To whom? To me. What is your name? Conchita. And his? Francisco. Conchita, do you want to marry Francesco? - Yes. Francesco, do you want to many Comma'? Ego vos in matrimonio coniungo. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, amen. Tomorrow morning, we'll take the Alcazar. At six, the mine will be blown up. Toledo will be evacuated and at 6:25, the troops will begin the assault. Long live the Republic! - Long live! Calling Alcazar! This is your last chance to surrender. Tomorrow morning, we will blow you up! Answer! Excuse me. Come here! You can see much better from here. There it is: the Alcazar! It's time to evict these poor, deluded morons. 1/60 aperture and no talking! Put cotton in your ears, too! You'll understand! It's to shield yourself from the noise of 600 tons of dynamite Not 600; 6 tons of dynamite! Will we have to wait long? - No. One minute. - Here we are, then. NOW! Go'.! Now? - No, wait! NOW! Step inside and fight back! Come here! The ladder, quick! Amid the smoking ruins, the sur- viving defenders continue to fight. It seems like all the women and children are buried under rubble. The resistance at the Alcazar is miraculous. The fortress will not yield. After five days of violent assaults, the situation remains unchanged. Can they free the defenders of the Alcazar? Another one gone. One by one, they all run out. - The tanks are coming back! They're too strong. It's too much for us to fight. 68 days of siege. Our troops so near and all this in vain. By God, don't let them take us alive! Get some more bandages! - Right away. How will this end? - Only God can save us now. Not even God! - Don't blaspheme, God will save us. Everything here is a miracle. We even survived the explosion. - You still have faith! And yet you lost Francisco. - I didn't lose him; he lives in me. Where no one can take him away! He gives me faith. He and all the others cannot have died in vain. Their battery is veering about, sir. Are you sure? - Yes sir, I saw it myself. The Reds are leaving; our troops are coming! #con Ia camisa nueva que tu bordaste en rojo ayer# #me hallara Ia muerte si me Ileva y no te vuelvo a ver.# #Formare junto a mis companeros que hacen guardia sobre Ios lucer0s# #impasible el ademan, y estan presentes en nuestro afan.# #Si te dicen que cai, me fui al puesto que tengo alli.# General, sir, nothing new to report from the Alcazar.
