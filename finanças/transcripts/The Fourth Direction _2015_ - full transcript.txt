FOURTH DIRECTION FOURTH DIRECTION Please drop us here. What now? The other shoe. Should I ask him? Ask. Brother... Does this train go to Amritsar? I don't know gentlemen. Ask the railway clerk. Sir... Does this train go to Amritsar? No, brother. This is the last station. Gentlemen, do you have to go to Amritsar? I too have to go to Amritsar. This train will also go to Amritsar. But it is emptied here. Passengers are not allowed to travel further. If we plead and request together, they may let us board. Respected Sir... Sir... Hello. We are three passengers. We have to go to Amritsar. Please help us out. We will compensate you as much as we can. No way, brother. How do I know who you are? How can anyone be trusted? There are strict orders... ...that the train should go empty. Please approach someone else. Leave it now. Let me go and try. Wait. They are all bastards. Nobody wants to help. Sardarji, be kind to us. Kindness! The train does not belong to my father! Try approaching the guard. The guard went to get some water. The signal is already down. He picked up the green light and flashed it to the driver. The driver started the engine. And the guard came running after the train... Ok. All right. Sir, we are stuck with a problem. We are coming from Chandigarh, hoping we would get a train here. But we were late. We will be extremely grateful if you let us travel to Amritsar. We could stand in your cabin. I understand your problem. But how can I take such responsibility given the prevailing situation? Who wants to risk one's job? Or even one's life! Sorry, I cannot help you. We have checked the train. Everything is fine. -Sir, can we please come in? -No. -Sir, it's a short distance. -I said no. Move away. -Please let us in. -Can't you listen? -It's the last train. -Have some sense. Sir, it's night-time... We can stand. What are you doing? Go away. We are your Hindu brothers. If you won't help, then who will? Have some sense... What are you doing? -What are you doing? -Get inside! -No! -Come on. Let me get in! What are you doing? Don't get in! -Sir, please let me come in. -No Sardarji... I am with them. -Move back! -Let me come in. Please let me in for God's sake. May your children be blessed. -Have some mercy on me. -No! My companions are already in. Let me in. -Please let me come in! -I told you already. What's the big deal if I get inside? He is with us. Please let him in. If you have so much sympathy for him, you can also get off. With me on board there won't be any additional burden. Please let me in. -Don't get in! -Let it be, brother. You're really strange. There is a limit. This is no way to behave. Let it be sir. Don't mind. What do you mean “don't mind”? What I should do now is to stop the train at some isolated station... ...and make you get down. You are not concerned about yourselves, so what will you care about others? Move ahead now. What do you mean I shouldn't get angry? Gentlemen, one of you can come and sit with us. We can adjust. Two of you could sit on the other trunk. One person can sit here and two of you there. The distance is long. It’s a two and a half hour journey. You will get tired if you stand all the way. Sardarji, you sit with them. May you live long, son. Now that you're in, go and sit there. See that you do not damage the trunk. Go ahead and damage it. Don't do anything good! You did a wrong thing by forcing yourselves onto the train. Should I make you people get off the train or have you arrested? Sir, kindly excuse us. We were helpless. Your helplessness matters... ...but not of others? If I am caught allowing you on the train, I could end up losing my job. Also, these are difficult times... Who can know someone’s intentions? What if something bad was to happen? To whom will I turn for help? These Sikh youths explained their situation and I simply could not refuse. One or two people are acceptable. But barging your way in, like you did... That was very kind of you. We are grateful to you. We should be obliged to pay something. At least, as much as the fare. Don't take from them. Return their money. Murari, take the money. A FEW MONTHS EARLIER Be careful. It’s so late in the night. We should have started earlier. We are almost there. Almost there. The house that you see over there... ...the way to the village is right next to it. It seems we have come the wrong way. Let's go from here. You will end up loosing me today. Don't be silly. Have some courage. We will soon be there. Be carefully. Should I ask here? No. Please don't. You never know who lives there. Seems like a farmer’s house. A family must be living here. You hold Neetu. I will go and find out. Be careful. Brother... Brother... Who's there? Hello brother. We have to go to Rampur to Pandit Ram Nath's house. I am their son-in-law. We came by bus and took the short-cut to the village instead of the main road. But we have lost our way. Hello brother. We have to go to Rampur to Pandit Ram Nath's house. I am their son-in-law. Hoping to be quicker, we took a short-cut instead of the main road. But we have lost our way. Oh... The path to the village is towards the east. You have come towards the west. Who is it, Joginder? Pandit Ram Nath’s son-in-law. He has lost the way to the village. Son, we also belong to Rampur. But since our lands were far off, we came and settled here. Are you the husband of the elder daughter Dulari? No, the younger daughter, Parvati's. The one who is married in the city. -Hello aunt. -Blessings, daughter. Paro, it’s been such a long time since I saw you. It's your uncle's house and you are standing outside! Come inside. We shifted here from the village hoping for a better life. Farming and looking after the cattle would be easier. How could we have known the circumstances would change. Sometimes we spend all night in fear. You never know who might land up at odd hours. Sometimes we feel we should go back to the village. At least, there are people to care for you. Here, drink some milk. You should not be out so late. You know the prevailing situation. You never know who might be out there in the night. You have come for your sister's wedding. Daughters should come a few days earlier to help. I wanted to come but... ...was busy at home. Of course, you are now a city dweller. Where will you find the time? I would have asked you to stay for the night. But Panditji will be worrying. He must be expecting you. Joginder... Go with them to the village. We are almost there, brother. Just a little more. Somehow, we left late from home. The village begins here. I will return now. Thank you so much. We inconvenienced you at night. -God is the Ultimate Truth. -God is the Ultimate Truth. -God is the Ultimate Truth. -God is the Ultimate Truth. Tommy. Come. Let's go. Come. Come on. Let's go. Joginder... Joginder... What's the matter? There seem to be militants around. The dog is continuously barking. You quietly go back to sleep. This dog will doom the entire family. Go to sleep. Tommy... be quiet. Won't you be quiet... you scoundrel. I will beat you with my slippers. Joginder, stay here. I will open the door. Be quiet... Where are you going? Don’t open the door. Go inside. Go and tie him up in the barn. Oh God! Just calm down. Sukhdev, you too go inside. Take him away now. Go. Take him! Khalsaji... Please come in. We have tied the dog inside. There is nothing to fear now. Come in. Do you really think we are scared of the dog? We live by the edge of the sword. You, however, seem to have lost your fear. You know our orders, why haven't you killed the dog yet? Come! Come on! You are not going to understand verbally. -Please try to understand. -Don't hurt him, please. Please listen to me. -Please try to understand. -Move out of the way. Come! Come on! Don't hurt him brother. Please listen to me. Move! Get out of my way! Lock this kid inside. -I am begging you. Please let him go. -Please listen to me. -Can't we sit down and discuss this? -He hasn't done anything wrong. Listen to me. Make him keep quiet. Please let him go. -Please leave him. -Let's sit and talk. Don't hurt him. -I beg you. -At least tell us what his crime is! You are like my brother. Please don't do this! Tell me... -Please, I am begging you! -Should I waste a bullet now? -Please stop this... -Look what they have done to you. Khalsaji... This dog is stubborn. We have tried leaving him far off... ...but he returns every time. Step aside comrade. Brother... Aren't you the same Joginder Singh who used to play Kabbadi? Isn't it? Yes, brother. I am the same Joginder. Sit down on the cot. You are standing as if you are accused! Sit down. Daughter Beero... boil some milk for our brothers. Mother... Where will you get milk at this hour? You must have set most of the milk as curd. Get some tea for everyone instead. Son, don't be scared. Come sit here. Samma and Joginder took Tommy... ...on their cycles to the bazaar of Baba Budha Sahib. They even tricked him into getting lost in the crowd. On their way back, they stayed the night at Joginder's sister's house in Panjwar. When they got home the next morning... ...Tommy was already waiting on the threshold wagging his tail. Then on the night of the new moon... ...Sadha Seetal had to make an offering on Baba Sheikh Fatta’s grave... ...from the milk of a newly mothered buffalo. He suggested, “There is enough to eat there. A large number of dogs too... ...Tommy is likely to stay there.” Joginder took Tommy to Sheikh Fatta in Seetal's trailer. There, they gave ten rupees to a volunteer. They tied the dog with a chain to a peg in the ground... ...and instructed the volunteer not to untie it till the next morning. They returned to the village in the evening. We thought that we got rid of Tommy. But on the 6th day, Sukhdev started jumping with joy on the terrace. He came running down the steps, shouting... "Tommy is back... Tommy is back..." You tell us now, what should we do? What do you want us to say? Just let us know whether you care for your life or not. You choose. Brother... They are also your kith and kin. For the sake of the community, we have left our homes. Security forces are pursuing us like dogs. Thirsty for our blood. We have to move around at night at odd hours. Visits and lodging also have to be at places like yours. If you keep dogs, they will bark and betray us. You are intelligent enough to understand what I say. The security forces certainly don't spare people like you. See for yourself, what happened to the family of the sergeant in your village... Burning smoke like that can come out of anybody's house. By God's grace, you are sacrificing your lives for our sake... ...and the cause of the religious order. You are our flesh and blood, not strangers. May you be blessed. We will do whatever you say. Son, my own nephew died a martyr's death last year. A jewel of a son for his parents. The only loving brother of three sisters. You would surely have heard the name. Sukhwant of Thetharka. He asked my cousin to arrange a meeting with his mother. Hordes of security forces came striding forth that night. The family was rudely woken up, made to stand in a line and asked... ...“Who is Sukhwant amongst you?” Sukhwant came out so that the family members would be spared. And then, son, don't ask further. Only a mother knows the pain. Before her own eyes, her son's leg was broken... ...and he was bundled into a van and taken away. For many days, villagers made innumerable rounds trying to find him. Police kept saying that they knew nothing. They denied arresting any boy named Sukhwant. And then, brother, after fifteen days there was a report in the paper... ...saying Sukhwant had been killed in some police encounter. Don't weep mother. We shouldn't weep at the death of martyrs. Be strong. We kept the dog to guard against petty crimes. Once during a winter night, while we slept inside... ...somebody stole the fan of the water pump. We have undertaken to guard the community... ...so why should you fear thefts? Kill the dogs and switch the lights off. Inform us if you are scared of anybody. Using our name, some bad elements indulge in crime... ...or blackmail people. Let us know if there is any such problem. No. We have no such problem. There is God's grace. We will leave now. But we will keep coming back. And we don't want to find any trace of the dog. And keep the outside lights switched off at night. Pass this message on to the nearby farmhouses. Let's go brothers. Baba Budha Sahib, we are blessed. You have saved us from the clutches of death. We are extremely grateful to you, Almighty. Tommy, come here. Come son. Come here. Come here Tommy. Come and eat some curd. Come on Tommy. Come here. Come. Tommy. Come here. Tommy, have the curd. Eat. Come on, eat it. Tommy, go ahead. Eat the curd Tommy. Eat it. Here... Tommy. Tommy, come back. Tommy. Sukhdev... Sukhdev... Go upstairs. Go to your mother. Sukhdev! Come up. Didn't you hear? Come upstairs. Sukhdev... Leave him. Go upstairs to your mother. Didn't you hear? Get up! Get up... Get up. Come on. Go to your mother. Tommy, have some curd, my son. Take it. Tommy. Tommy... I can see some military vehicles. What's the matter, sir? What are you up to? Are you Joginder? Yes sir, I am Joginder. Who comes and stays at your house at night? Nobody, sir. Shut up. You are lying. You conspire with the militants? No sir, what kind of conspiracy? What will we ordinary people conspire against? Who are you? I am his uncle. We live in the next farmhouse. -Did I ask you to interrupt? -Sir, we have nothing to do with this. We make an honest living. Nobody came to our house or stayed at night. You have received some wrong information. Really? Yes, I’ve been misinformed. You fired gunshots in the night? Ram Singh, search the house. What kind of firing? How can we fire gunshots? This is the limit. Why do you want to search? Sir, please stop them. We have done no wrong. There is nothing inside. What do you want to find? You cannot search the house... Check over here. Mother, what's inside them? What do you think? Quilts, bedsheets and clothes. What else? Brother, listen to me. You will find nothing here. This is where the children sleep. Children sleep here. What will you find here? You have been searching the house for no reason. You have ransacked our entire house. You have been searching the house for no reason. What's inside this? Our clothes. You won’t find anything and you have turned our house upside down. For no reason. ...without a reason... Brother, please listen to me. We are already in trouble. The militants had come. They threatened us and left.. They even fired. We have no idea who they were, where they came from and went to. We are already scared. Shoot the dog. Shoot it. Let it be. Here... Have one. I say I am not my father's son... ...if I don't join the militants. Is this life? It is better to die. Don't talk rubbish. Stop howling like a dog. Stay level headed. It is easy to beat innocent people by donning uniforms. Let them put their arms aside... ...and fight one against one... ...then we'll make them lick their feet. Or let them arm us with weapons. Maybe it's time we took up arms... Have some shame. Keep your senses. The elders rightly say... ...that dogs are more loyal than humans. Acknowledging a dog's devotion, Baba Bulleh Shah had rightly remarked... ..."Bulleh Shah, invoke the blessings of the Master. Look, even the dogs have excelled over you." Bless us Almighty. Let good sense prevail. It does not feel good to say so... ...but go and leave Tommy somewhere. Or give him poison. Before he brings more trouble... ...better to get rid of the dog. You have been uncomfortable all day, due to pain. Your body must be aching... God Almighty be thanked that nothing worse happened. If you go to the village... ...get some medicine to relieve the pain. And ask Mukha... -Hello. -Hello. BOMB BLAST IN PATHANKOT, 2 DEAD MILITANTS STRIKE PANIPAT: 13 SHOT DEAD AT A WEDDING Wondrous Enlightener. Bless humanity, Almighty. Let peace and harmony prevail. Supreme divine... Mukha, what's happened to you? Mukha Singh, come inside. I have no fear. I will repeat what I've already said. Come what may, I will not kill the dogs. You can assign me any other duty. Why Mukha Singh? You have the experience of a lifetime. I am already indebted to God for many acts of omission and commission. I will not kill the voiceless innocent. You have been killing dogs all these years. If you refuse now, you will get into trouble. Will you be able to handle it? Let there be trouble for me. I am not afraid. Are you prepared to face their bullets? Yes, I will face the bullets. I am not afraid. Collect these tablets and ointment from the compounder. What else can I do? We have already requested you. Please give us some poison to kill the dogs or... ...send someone to do it. -Tommy. -Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. -Tommy. -Tommy. Tommy.

The storming of the temple, codenamed Operation Bluestar... ...followed weeks of growing tension... ...between the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and... ...Sikhs in the northern state of Punjab. Indira Gandhi first moved forces in. to surround the temple in early March. Before this, the temple was under the long occupation... ...of Sikh extremists led by Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. The religious risks of storming the shrine led to a tense stand-off. The security forces were hoping the militants would surrender... ...making a direct attack unnecessary. With the imposition of a 36 hour curfew on 3rd June... ...the speculation of an attack on the Sikh shrine increased. Forces have now cleared the outer buildings of the complex... ...but a group of heavily armed Sikhs, including Bhindranwale... ...are believed to be hiding in a building close to the temple.

He will stay with us. Tommy. Tommy. Come, let's go. Hey! Tommy! Sukhdev's father... Sukhdev's father... Sukhdev's father... I hear some movement in the fields. Tommy is also barking... Why doesn't this bloody dog stop barking? Tommy... Be quiet. Be quiet. Tommy! I told you to be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet! Be quiet. Be quiet, or... Quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Tommy, quiet! Be quiet. Quiet. Tommy! Tommy is fine, son. Nothing has happened to him. It will be fine. Tommy is fine, son. You are tired. Go back to sleep. Come now... Come... Brother, who's there? Uncle... Can't you tie up your buffaloes properly? Come now... Joginder, it seems the dog's back is broken. Nothing has happened to him. You go inside. He will be fine by morning. Where are you going? Tommy... You brave one. You will be fine. I cannot drop you at the station. You people will have to get off here. But be careful while getting off. Make sure nobody sees you... ...otherwise you will unnecessarily get caught. Come on. Get up gentlemen. This is the ideal place to get off. Brothers... Please stop. You started running... ...and did not even wait for us. Actually my aunt, this young man's mother, died today at 2 pm. I fetched him from the village. We got delayed as we came by the bus. We requested the guard and he allowed us in. We are scared if the police spot us... ...they might fire at us thinking we are terrorists. Who asks questions these days before firing? Do not worry. You can walk with us. Brothers, this is not good. You did not even wait for me. You come with us now, Sardarji.
