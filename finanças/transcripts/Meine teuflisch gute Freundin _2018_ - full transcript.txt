Welcome to Hell. Not the whole city. Just this tower block here. This one. You surely imagined Hell differently. Maybe you believe the Devil is a guy with cloven hooves. So, have we made the world more evil? - How's the German market doing? - Excellent. This is my dad. THE DEVIL. LIKES: POLLUTING THE OCEAN, CLIMATE CHANGE, HASSLING EMPLOYEES. Plus 2.3 percent. Especially in large cities, we are successful as hell. - And in smaller towns? - Ditto. Plus 0.3 in Villingen-Schwenningen, plus 0.7 in Oberursel. How measly is that? Minus 1.5 percent in Birkenbrunn. Business sucks? Not my problem. Well ... Why does he only hire idiots? Let me do it! LILITH. LIKES: CYBERBULLYING, WREAKING HAVOC, ANNOYING HER DAD. "My best friend is pissed off at me. Is it okay to bitch about her?" "Why only bitch about her?" "Spread nasty rumours about her." "Pwn her." Believe me, guys, when I get out of here, I'll show you how to be really bad. HOW TO BE REALLY BAD Shut up. Dad. - What's this? - I'm taking a break. - What about him? - He didn't want to take a break. - He really talks a lot. - That's his job. He's your teacher. - May I quit? - No. Where did you leave off? I was talking about the Deadly Sins and how to use them to divert humans from the path of virtue. Good. Give me an example of how to use envy. Envy works well with most humans if you use material goods. Let's say ... this designer dress. Everyone wants it, hardly anyone can afford it. I go shopping with some girls, make fun of their clothes, and encourage them to ... steal. And when they've done it once, they'll do it again and again. Ta-da. They're bad. What's not allowed? Magic. We're allowed to tempt them, but humans must choose the path of evil. Well done. I told you. Now let me go to the humans, Dad. Teenagers ... You may leave. Forever? It's your choice. Teach my daughter or dust files in the cellar. I'll take the files. - So, may I go? - No. I'll get you a new teacher, a stricter one than that clown. I don't want a new teacher! I need action! I'm fed up with only being evil online. Lilith, I'm telling you one last time: You're too young for the work of the Devil. - We'll talk about it when you're 18. - No! Sorry. Kids ... Dad. It's me. Listen: Let me go to the humans for a year, on probation. I'll choose a nice place. New York, LA, whatever. And I'll prove that I can be just as evil as you. What the hell, how dare you? So? - What? - I accept. But just for a week, not a year, and I'll tell you where to go and which person to tempt to be bad. - Only one person? - Yes. - What's the catch? - No catch. If you're really that good, you can stay in field service, and if not ... you'll work in the cellar with your ex-teacher. Forever. - You'd do that to me? - I'm the Devil. Deal. Hang on. I'm from Saarlouis? - Where's that? - Hardly anyone knows it. You can explain any odd behaviour by saying you're from Saarland. Can't I be from Berlin? Or at least Hamburg? So? Target person: Greta Birnstein. Her parents think we want to move and I want to see the school. You know the drill? No physical contact, no compassion. Be as cold as ice. This is your Locknar. Open it. It measures the temperature of your emotions. If you're not cold-blooded, its colour changes. But it should always stay black. Then you're on the right track. Okay, I got it. Where are we going? A penthouse? With a terrace and a whirlpool! GRETA BIRNSTEIN. LIKES: SINGING, READING, HOMEWORK. - Don't you want to get out? - Seriously? Hi! You must be Lilith. I'm Greta. - I'm happy you're here! - We'll see about that. Welcome! Bad idea. - I've got a cold. - Oh. Thanks for warning me. Welcome to Birkenbrunn! SIBYLLE BIRNSTEIN. LIKES: KNITTING, MAKING JAM, HUGGING PEOPLE. - You must be Lilith. - Careful, she's got the flu. I'm Sibylle. Nice to have you here. We're so happy. My goodness. Bless you. My husband grows the best fruit in Birkenbrunn. You'll feel better in no time. And if you like, you can call me Mum. Or Sibylle. I beg your pardon? Neither. I could ... call you Mrs Birnstein. Yes. Just a second. What a great start. I told you, no physical contact. Couldn't you choose normal people? They're ... so disgustingly nice. - Let me see results in a week. - I can do this. Hi! I've got to go, or else she'll hug me too. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, little devil. My father ... is a little shy. GABRIEL BIRNSTEIN. LIKES: PLAYING THE GUITAR, GROWING COURGETTES, DROPPING BRICKS. All right ... Careful. - This is hot. - It looks delicious. All of this has has been grown with love in our own garden. Dad talks to the plants so they'll grow. Sometimes he'll sing to them. Wow. And do the plants sing along? All creatures like being cared for. What you give to them, you'll get back a thousandfold. - Dad? - Yes. Thank you. What does the ant say as it shoots up the anteater's snout? "Enjoy your meal!" All right. Serviettes? Is it good? It's delicious. Pumpkin, you've outdone yourself. And which ant is going to help me clear the table? Me! Me! Me! I can take those. That was your fault. Yes. Of course it was. - Oh. - I'm sorry, I ... Oh no, these were Grandma's. I'm such a Clumsy Clara. You're not a Clumsy Clara. Just leave it, I'll get a brush. Some say broken dishes bring good luck. - Are you always like that? - What do you mean? "Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a Clumsy Clara!" Why so calm? My dad says, if you can't say anything nice, you'd best smile and keep quiet. - Have you got alcohol or drugs? - No! What about your friends? Are any of them cool? Oh no, you haven't got any. It's not that I don't want any ... Nobody likes you. But what do you do for fun? Well, I help my mum around the house. I sing in the church choir. I read a lot. What else. Thanks, Dad. Look. Oh, that's beautiful. And it's expensive. You'll never be able to afford this. Of course you're envious. I'd be envious ... No, don't worry, I'm not envious. I'm popping to the bathroom. - Have you got a boyfriend? - No. You're lying, aren't you? Definitely not, I'd never lie. - This is the old ... - Wearing an oven cloth again? - Mum made it. - Doesn't make it look nicer. Do I look as if I'd ride a bike? Well ... How do normal people get to school? By taxi? We can take the bus but ... that usually stresses me out. Stress is good. We're taking the bus. Wait! This direction! You should have said. Come on. Hurry! Hi. Hi, Melody. Hi, Daria. Be quiet, loser. Sure, no problem. Whoa, what was that? Melody and Daria. They've got a band. - They sing really well. - Do they? Which one of you wogs has been eating kebabs? Daria, aren't there any toothbrushes in the ghetto? Shut up, Eddie. Let's check your bag, bedwetter. Well, well. Miss Birkenstocks is pretending to be invisible. - And you are? - Definitely a fan of yours. Are you messing with me? Not right now. Don't worry, I'll do that later. Explain the rules. Don't mess with him. Melody, dear, can I borrow this? What a loser. - You can't do that! - You just saw me do it. That was really bad! Be honest: How did you feel when I did that? - I was afraid. - Your very first emotion? I was scared for you. Wildeck! Get down here immediately! - I'll finish my fag first. - You won't. Stop me. You'll be expelled! - You always say that. - Who's that? That's Samuel. He always does weird things. - I like him. - Okay, I'm calling the fire brigade. Don't stand around and stare. Go inside. Let's go! Your phones, please. Thank you. Samuel, it would be nice if you took the test this time. I can't guarantee that, unfortunately. I reckoned you'd say that. - Good luck. - Thank you. I hope you covered the same topics in Saarlouis. - What are you doing? - Saarland style. We know how to find stuff we need. MATHS TEST ANSWERS - See? - The answers? Do you want to copy them too? ANSWERS, TEST 3. No. All right. You can start now. Have fun. I'm sorry, Ms Engelhardt. But that's not my thing. - I'll have to report that. - Sure. Try to finish soon, please. What are you doing? You can't .. Spit it out! Man! Miss Maths totally lost it. So you do have a bad side. I did that for you! You had test B and copied the answers for A. This means trouble. - Too bad. I never asked for your help. - What? Why are you so mean? Are you serious? So you're blaming me now? I'm sorry. It's okay. I forgive you. - Thank you. - Stop it. Why not let the Helmholtz Quartet play? - They played four times. - They're a delight. - Not just because of my son. - No, of course not. Something else is crucial for the event. My speech. I'm going to talk about my trip to Africa. Financed by the friends' association? This is none of your business. And I only do it for the school. For the school, of course. I guess we agree. I need the new agenda tomorrow. - Can I help you? - Hello. - The headmaster's asked to see me. - You? Perhaps I should join you. - So? - No punishment. But he's right. I shouldn't have done it. Is Eddie that snobby headmaster's son? Yes. Hey, Woolly, so you finally found a friend? You must have a time machine. Girl, stop buying your clothes in the Middle Ages. Aren't you angry they keep making fun of you? I'm used to it. Hey, that's him, right? CARLO. LIKES: GIRLS, GIRLS, MAKING MUSIC. He's the one whose pics are all over your wardrobe. You're bright red. - Oh, are you embarrassed? - No! I ... Wow. You're totally out of it just because that guy walked by. - Prick! Liar! Idiot! - What's the matter? Break up with me before you see someone else. I'm breaking up with you. I can't believe it! You can't do that! You're such a prick, I hate you! That happens from time to time. Carlo is a womanizer. That's sheer hate. Well, when you're dumped like that ... So you'd freak out too? Well, he doesn't even talk to me. Would you get me some liquorice, love? - Those candy snakes. - Okay. - You new here? - Shut it. I'm here to offer you a deal. Do you know Greta Birnstein? Miss Birkenstocks. What do I have to pay so you chat her up, make her feel like she's the coolest girl ever? - Is that a joke or something? - No, it's a prank, idiot. And I'll pay you. You can be bought? I'm a DJ. I make music. Isn't there anything you need money for? Waldorf Rocket. The best synthesiser out there. We've got a deal. - What do I have to do? - Pretend to be into her. - Ask her out. - That's all? You'll get the other half when you dump her. You're hardcore. - I'd chat you up for free. - Sorry, I'm out of your league. So, in three days, you'll break up with her. - Well? - Now? Yes. SAMUEL. LIKES: EVERYTHING EXCEPT SCHOOL. You got a fag? So you re the class clown? Do I look like a clown? Where's my Rolex, Wildeck? - Where did you last see it? - At the gym. Which is where you nicked it. I'd never do that. Search him. - Go get the watch! - He's on the roof! I can see that, spaz. Then get her. - As a hostage? - She hasn't got the watch. Just do it! What's the matter? Haven't you got the guts? Any other hobbies? Knitting. So what's the plan? Catch! - Wow, what's that? - Ask me what time it is. Hungry? It's a one-horse town. - What do you guys do for fun? - Buy a train ticket to the next city. - And how often? - Not often enough. - But I'm leaving soon. - Where are you going? I'm out of here. Going to Berlin. You'll drop out of school? What a risk. When are you leaving? Soon. I just need to save some money. You need to save but you give the Rolex away? I just stole it to get on his nerves. We've got to work on your attitude. What do you mean? Nothing in particular. These are really yummy. - At least the sea is close. - It is? I've never been to the sea. - Where are you from? - From H- ... From Saarlouis. You can see it from up there. I don't really like churches. Me neither, but we don't need to pray. IT IS FINISHED. Come on, hurry up. Okay, so what now? What do you mean, what now? They've got some expensive stuff here. Take it and flog it off. For Berlin. No way. I only steal from knobs. How boring. You scared or what? I must have misjudged you. Are you insane? There you are. You won't believe what happened. Carlo talked to me. He was really nice! He asked me to come to his band rehearsal tomorrow. This is crazy! I thought he didn't even know I existed. - Are you okay? - I feel strange. I'm hot, and then I'm cold, and then I'm ... Bless you. I'm sweating. Oh no. I hope you don't have the flu. - Where were you? - I was hanging out with Sa- ... Samuel. - And what did you do? - We had currywurst. And then? And then nothing. That's it. - Are you in love? - Me? Good one. - Do you think he's cute? - What? I don't even think about that. He's one of many idiots here. End of story. Greta! Lilith! Would you please come and peel the apples for the pie? I'm not peeling apples with you. DAD CALLING - Hi, what's up? - "How was your first day?" Have you had any success so far? No worries. I'm only getting started. She's a hard nut to crack. Please. Piece of cake. Hang on a second. I'm sorry, Master. We have a tiny problem. Abundius has asked to be relieved of his duties. - "Why?" - "He's in love." He's in love? Get rid of him, right now! Yes, Master. "Whoa, wait a second, Dad." Devils can't fall in love. Then you didn't pay attention in school. It does happen. And devils who are in love are useless. "They become weak and sentimental." "Lilith?" Are you still there? - "Where were we?" - More pocket money. Nice try. Be nice and evil. You know what's at stake. Are we done? "Don't you have an ocean to pollute?" You're absolutely right. "And climate change doesn't just happen either." Bye. - Do I live in Africa? - No. - Am I a carnivore? - No. - So I'm a herbivore? - Yes. Are you all right, sweetheart? You can talk to us about anything, okay? What's with the knitting anyway? Knitting is ... It's marvellous. It's relaxing. It's creative, as you can see. Isn't it, my loves? Yes. I can teach you if you want. Greta and I are having our mother- daughter knitting day tomorrow. No, thanks. - Right ... - Did you forget, sweetie? But don't worry. I'm looking forward to it. No, you aren't? Your date is tomorrow. Is that true? Pumpkin! Our baby girl is becoming an adult. See, Greta? You don't need to dress provocatively and to put on make-up, because: true beauty comes from within. Don't be embarrassed. Your first love is one of the greatest experiences. - Do we know him? - Or her. We want Greta to develop freely, don't we? And if it's a boy after all ... let me know. - I'll get you some condoms. - Who is it? We shouldn't pressure her. Young love is like a young flower. It likes to grow in secret. Oh, you ... Why did you leave? You can't say stuff like that to them. Excuse me? I just saved your date. Aren't you excited? - I am. - See. We'll have to change a few things about you. You do want him to like you? - Yes. - Step one: stop dressing like your grandma. Clothes from this century. Concealer, lip gloss, eyeliner, mascara. - I'm not allowed. - But you'd love to try. Time for a makeover, bitch. Follow me. - Good God. - Pretty hot, right? - This is what we'll do tomorrow. - I can't go to school like this! I look like ... a prostitute. Just what guys like Carlo like. My mum won't let me do this. So make a scene! You're not a baby. Why are you scared of arguments? It's normal at our age. #cutthecord. You think? You're right. I'm sorry I'm being so complicated. I know you're really trying with me. It feels so nice to have someone you can trust. You're a gift from God. Up here. Samuel? Tell Lilith I want to talk to her. I'm not here. No. I'm asleep. No. Even better: I'm dead. She'll be right there. - Come on, go! - Never ever. Do you need any help? Don't touch me. What kind of idiot climbs up a roof at night? - You're here too. - Yes, but ... Got a fag? Here. You can keep them. I quit. But smoking fits your bad-boy image. Come on, that bit of smoke won't do any harm. No. Your loss. Why did you want to talk? I wanted to apologise for ... for the kiss. Yes. That was the worst. You gave me the ... the flu. - I don't ... - Don't do that again. - Come on, I thought we'd hang out ... - Forget it. Dammit. Oh no ... - Shit. - Hey. You're even cute when you're angry. Cute? Cool? But I know you like me. I'm not in love. I'm. Not. In love. I'm not in love. I'm not in love. - I'm not in love. - Did you say something? I'm talking to myself. Please stay out of this. Sorry. I'm not in love. I'm not in love. I'm not in love! Sunshine or rain, don't ever lose your courage. As the tides ebb and flow, the wind still guides your sails. - Have some of your vegetables too. - Go! Do it! - Bye, we're leaving! - Okay, bye! Have fun ... Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop. You're not leaving like this. What's wrong with you, Greta? Hey! That's a really nice dress. Greta never looks like this. Was the dress your idea? I can get one for you too. This dress is not appropriate for school. Plus, we don't support brands that exploit low-wage countries. - All right? - Pumpkin ... Why can't Greta decide for herself? Mummy dearest. You listen to me. Because there are rules in this house, Lilith. And you can either stick to them, or you can go home. Your father agrees. And while we're at it: You could put on different clothes too. Why didn't you fight back? Your mother forces you to dress like a sofa. I don't know how to stand up to my mum. Pathetic. You're just pathetic. Tweedledum and Tweedledee? Are you soulmates all of a sudden? Say something. Say something! Don't you have any self-respect? Why do you let them put you down? I swear, if I were you, I would have given them a nice makeover. Like this. What shampoo do you use? - I'm sorry. - What? That she made you wear that dress. Why won't your mother let you wear normal clothes? She says my personality should define me and not my clothes. She says there's nothing worse than fashion victims who will follow any trend just to be in. They're total slaves, not friends. - I wonder what it's like to be in. - It's brilliant. Everyone admires you, wants to be your friend. I bet that feels nice. I'll make sure you'll know how it feels. - What? - Trust me. Just follow my lead. Please ask your mum if I can have one of the dresses from her collection. I know, she promised that singer, but she has three already. - I don't know ... - Please talk to her. I don't like what you're doing. I don't like you letting me down. Trouble in paradise, Tweedledum and Tweedledee? Greta is being bitchy because her mum is famous now. - Greta's mum is famous? - Er, yes? Sibylle was the newcomer at Fashion Week. In New York. Please. Do you think I would wear this if it wasn't in? - But that's really ugly. - Excuse me? The fashion world is crazy about her. All of the big brands want her. Oh well, girls. You can't buy style. - Did she insult us? - No idea. - What was that? - Greta 2.0's birth. The Greta that everyone envies. - But it was just lies. - Stop it! I'm trying to help you. And I would appreciate it if you could play along. You just have to act like it's true. It can't be that hard! And try to talk like them for once. Be more arrogant and snotty. Go over there and strike a sexy pose. - Why? - Promo pics. Take off your jacket. What's that? The "Wet Blanket" pose? Stand up straight. And stick out those two Birnsteins. More sensuous. Seductive? - Put your hand on your head. - Like that? Hey, Greta. That's wicked. See you later. Play with your hair. And stick your hip out. Yes ... Chin down. Yes. Walk towards me. Yes. We'll need Photoshop. I'm popping to the little devils' room. Focus, you idiot. New look? - You look good. - I always look good. - Would you like to ... - I'm busy. See you later. Hey, girls. You didn't believe me. SIBYLLE BIRNSTEIN: FASHION'S RISING STAR Whoa! Sick. Miss Birkenstocks is wearing the same dress! But the biggest celebs bought it all. Too bad there's nothing left for you. Oh no ... But ... you ought to be able to pull some strings? Well ... maybe Greta can get you one? - But who's going to get it? - Me! Really? Why shouldn't it be me? The cooler one should wear it. - So obviously me. - Seriously? When are you going to accept I'm the boss of Pussy Deluxe? There would be no band without me! "Lilith, please report to the headmaster's office." "I repeat: Lilith Schwarz, report to the headmaster's office." - I'm kicking you out! - You're kicking me out? - You think it's that easy? - You're a shitty singer anyway! So you admit you punched my son. Yes. Do you have anything to say in your defence? I didn't know he was behind me. Or I would have done it right. Well, this is a first. Seidel? Make an example of her. You can count on it. Come with me, miss. Come on. So you punched the headmaster's son? Let's see what kind of punishment is in order. Here you are. Is there a fire? I just have to ring and there you are. - That was you? - Yes, I wanted to see you. - I know something we could do. - Whatever it is, I'm not interested. Too bad. I wanted to go to the sea. - Right now? - Got a bike? At the kiosk in five minutes? Hey, yo, Greta, what's up? Try to talk like them. Be more arrogant and snotty. Yo, totally chill. Er, well, Lilith showed us the photos. So gorgeous! You bitches know it! - Do you need the toilet? - No, why? Er, well ... You do have to look twice, but your dress is so gorgeous, really. That's really kind, thank you. Yeah, sick, huh? - Yes ... - Listen, do you think you could ask your mum if she's got two dresses for us? - You want one too? - Yes, please! Maybe not as huge as yours. She's trying to say there's got to be smaller sizes? Yes, my mum knits those for my little sisters too. Sistas. Bitches. Sorry! Sorry ... Well, er, I'd say the tighter and the shorter the better, right? - Brill, thank you. - Awesome. Hey, Greta, I'm leaving. What's going on? They were nice to me for the first time. Feels nice, huh? What about Carlo, when's your date? Later. At the rehearsal. I'm so nervous! You'll have to do something about your face. Why? There's this great new invention. It's called make-up. Thanks. - What? - Can I talk like a normal person now? Don't touch me! This is bullshit! What's so bad about taxis? - Are you okay? - Just testing the ground. - I'm here. - You've got the same bike as Eddie. It is Eddie's. Shall we go? - Have you ever ridden a bike? - Once or twice. - Once or twice? - Yes, once or twice. In Saarland, we always drive. Well then. Daria, your timing. A bit louder. - Are you okay? - Yes. Great. Are you sure? I ... I don't know if it's the best choice to have them sing in unison. Technical lingo. You know your stuff. Yes. I sing too. In the church choir. Girls ... Greta has a suggestion Well ... Maybe it would be better to have Daria sing a third lower? What are you on about? My voice is amazing. It is! That's not what I'm trying to say. I was just thinking if the second voice was lower, it would sound even better. Your mum doesn't make you important. We'll try it. - Sing lower. - But then we're short a voice. Can you sing it? - I ... I don't know, I ... - For me. You can do this. Listen. - You're not serious? - Seriously, Carlo? What? You can share a microphone. You think you just steal my part? Can you stop? A cappella on the count of three. One, two ... Chorus. Just like that. I thought you were one of those tree huggers. That was a great idea. Now with playback. WHAT'S MY FAVOURITE DAUGHTER UP TO? Is something wrong? My father. - What's he like? - He ... is a very powerful man. What does he do? He's keeping me prisoner. - In a huge tower. - So you're kind of a princess? Yes. You could say that. Shielded from the outside world. Who can visit her people for a week. And then ... he'll lock you back up? Maybe. If he does that, I'll come and rescue you. - You would do that? - Sure. I'll finish the dragon off, too. Would you turn the music off, please? Thank you. Girls, I'm sorry, but I've got bad news. Why, what's up? The headmaster has approached me about the festival. He doesn't want a band called Pussy Deluxe there. - Excuse me? But that's our name. - That's what I told him. Then he googled you ... and found this. So what? That video is wicked. Mr Pappenhoff doesn't think you're a good example and doesn't want you to perform. But he can't do that! We've been working on the performance for weeks! I'd prefer seeing you over the Helmholtz Quartet too. I'm sorry. Arsehole. - Do you want an ice cream? - Yes. 20 NEW MESSAGES CALL ME! LILITH!!! ANSWER ME! I'M ALL RIGHT. JUST VERY BUSY. ALL THE WORST. Devils who are in love are useless. They become weak and sentimental. Be nice and evil. You know what's at stake. Get rid of him, right now! - Which cone? - I've got to go. - I thought we'd go to the cinema. - Change of plans. May I? Your personal guardian angel. Heart and Lungs Department. - Is something wrong? - I want to go home. - Back to your dad's? - No! To yours. You can come with me, I'm packing up. - What Pappenhoff did was mean. - Yes. That guy's a pain. Tell me ... Could you imagine being a permanent member of Pussy Deluxe? Yes, but what about Melody and Daria? I don't think they'd like it. Ah, don't let them get to you. They're quite nice, actually. They're professional enough to see that it wasn't perfect until your voice made it perfect. I'd like to have you there. Really? Yes, I mean ... You're talented, know about music and don't show it off. That's cool. Sunshine or rain, don't ever lose your courage. As the tides ebb and flow, the wind still guides your sails. Shouldn't you have taken a turn already? Yes, that's right. Well, then ... See you tomorrow. That's Greta! Hi, Greta, do you want to come with us? Hi. I'm sorry, your first kiss, I've ... - I'm sorry. - Bye. What ... Greta! I've got this. I ruined Greta's date. Jesus. It was so embarrassing! I shouldn't have agreed to go on a date. He wanted to kiss you. You wanted that. But it's all a bit much at the moment. Just yesterday, everyone made fun of me, and today, the cutest boy at school cares about me. Perfect! Your life couldn't be better. Stop whining. What if Carlo is not serious about me? Rubbish! He fancies you. It's serious. You think so? Thanks for being there for me. Every time I want to give up, you give me courage. Honestly, I'm so in love with him. It's the most beautiful feeling. Take off your make-up. - Do you still have my bag? - Yes. What's that for? Is that lip gloss? My dad gave it to me. It's like a ... personal thermometer. You've got odd things in Saarland. Have you still got a fever? Apparently. Oh dear. How about a bit of fresh air? I have to harvest the radishes. Do you want to help me? No. It'll be amazing once you live here. We'll have so much fun! - Greta? - Yes? I don't think I'll move to Birkenbrunn. - Why? - Because my father ... He thinks I shouldn't be here. He thinks ... I'm getting too soft here. Too nice. I mustn't be. He doesn't want you to be nice? Well, he is ... he ... He likes strange bets, you know? We made a bet that I wouldn't be able ... I'm here on probation. I can stay if ... if I do evil things. Your father is an odd duck. Who would want his daughter to be evil? I thought I could do it. But it looks like ... I'll have to go back on Saturday. Hey, don't give up! You've still got two days to be evil. Well ... if you can stay here in that case ... I don't want you to leave. I want to stay too. Well, any ideas? Well ... I've got this super mean thing going ... Let's hope it'll work out. Wouldn't it be nice if you could stay? I've never had a best friend. SLEEP WELL, SWEET DREAMS. FEELING BETTER? YES, SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. WHERE ARE YOU? Carlo? So you're doing video and audio tomorrow? - Yes, sir. - The pictures for Pappenhoff's talk. - Aye. - Thank you. SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. WHERE ARE YOU? - Hi, Carlo. - Hi. See you this afternoon? Depends on how my morning is going. Honestly, I'm so in love with him. It's the most beautiful feeling. - I'm so angry! - But what could we do, Mel? If our daft headmaster doesn't want us to perform, we won't. And? Do we look hot or do we look hot? - Absolutely beautiful. - Thanks, sweetie. Your dress is cool, I also want one. - What is it, morons? - Where can I get that dress? - It's so cool! - It's an exclusive Birnstein dress. Do you want one too? They're sold out, so forget it. - Hey, Greta. - Hey. Ooh, love is in the air, man! Is your father around? No. Well ... Deal's off. Don't hurt her. - Are you crazy? - If you hurt her, I'll kill you. For your information: I wasn't going to. I like her. And you can have your bloody money back. Here. You gave him money to break up with me? How could you? I thought you were my friend? I've told you that I'm supposed to do evil. I'll tell you something: go to hell, Lilith! You can be angry after all! And how does it feel? I'm not angry. I'm just sad. COME TO THE BEACH. NOW. - Are you all right? - Sure, I'm fine. What's wrong? I blew it. My father was right, I'm still too young. Shit. I blew it. - I wanted to be with you when I do it. - Do what? What are you doing? Do you feel better now? What? I'll stay here, I'll stay in Birkenbrunn. But didn't you want to leave? - That was before. - Before what? Before you came here. I ... really like being here now. Maybe it's not a bad idea to graduate. Wait a second. Because ... because you met me, you ... like school and want to graduate? That's terrible! Will you tell me already ... Meeting you ... was the worst thing that has ever happened to me. You've made me become weak and ... sentimental. It's over. Can we talk? I broke up with Samuel. I didn't want to. - So why did you do it? - Because it's all his fault. Just because I fell in love with this ... arsehole, I can't be evil anymore. Here. That's not a thermometer. It measures my emotional temperature. And if I were really evil, then it would be jet-black, but I'm not! I don't know what I am anymore. I think you tried really hard to be evil. But perhaps you have to accept that you're not. Or you wouldn't have stopped Carlo. - No! - To protect me. - No. - Hey! You're not evil. And that's good. But not for me. I'm just here on probation. You think your dad will take you back? And what if I tried to help you? Yeah, sure ... You, the nicest girl in Birkenbrunn. I just thought ... Here, your vanity bag. Greta, wait a second. - That's a donation for the raffle. - A vegetable? Not just any vegetable. It's the courgette that helped me win the International Cucurbits Award. - All right, Dad. See you. - See you. Bye! - Would you ... Yes. - Yes. Think your dad's here? - Haven't seen him yet. - But he's coming, right? There's Melody and Daria. See you later, okay? - Hi, girls! - Hey. - We're really doing this? - What do you think? Hey, pussy cats, I heard your gig is off? And the itching powder? I'm looking forward to his performance. Well, everything's ready in there. - Hey. - Hi, Greta. Right, we'll go backstage, okay? Did everything work out? Yes, sure, I'd say Pappenhoff will be happy. Thank you. - Should I ... - Yes, thank you. Are you okay? - That's a big squash. - It's a courgette. Sorry, may I? Thank you. - Do you know where Greta is? - No. But she has to be around here. I like to mingle with humans now and then. Sit down. And where's Greta? Should be around here. Dear students, dear parents, I'm delighted to welcome you to the annual Helmholtz School Festival. Our esteemed Headmaster went on a trip recently. Have you succeeded in your task? Is Greta a bad girl now? - Africa! - Yes, dear guests ... That's what I thought. During my holidays, I took an educational trip for our school ... We're leaving during the break. I went to East Africa. Please share with me my reverence in the face of the cradle of civilisation. The Serengeti. The last great nature park. Today increasingly at risk because of environmental pollution or, more specifically, acid rain. During my trip, I discovered many traditions of the indigenous peoples: naive, magical rituals with which I gladly engaged. In other respects, I adapted to the natives' way of life and stayed in one of their primitive bamboo huts. A wonderful experience for which I'm deeply grateful. Those aren't my photos. Well ... The Victoria Falls. UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to thousands of baboons. Look at the absolute ruler of these monkeys. Seidel! What are you doing? Enough! Stop it! Stop it at once! Set change! Please excuse this derailment. Whoever is responsible for this crap will be expelled, are we clear? Let's now welcome the Helmholtz Quartet. Take off the hat, boy, at once! Haven't you got manners? Don't tell me Greta did that on her own. I see your handwriting all over it. It wasn't me. Is that little Miss Birnstein? - Those are your dresses. - Yes. Enough! Stop it! Enough! Enough, stop it! Enough! That's it! You disobeyed my orders. Must have slipped through the cracks. You're fired! - We'll wait for the investigation. - Investigation? The one against you for misappropriation of funds. I want a dress like that! Please! All right, guys, at this point I'd like to thank my very best friend who has been so encouraging and supportive this past week. Lilith, without you I wouldn't be standing here. Oh, yes, and this ... is the very last dress from the totally awesome Birnstein collection. Grab it, guys! Come on, let's go. They like my dresses. I told you. They're very special. Impressive. I didn't think you had it in you. Even experienced devils aren't immune to the treacherous world of human emotions and love, but you ... Kudos. But are you really sure that you already want to leave home? Full time in the field? Yes. - Maybe a few more years ... - Don't back out. I passed the test. Yes. I hereby appoint you first degree field representative. Oh, but wait, Lilith. Please show me the Locknar. For the sake of completeness. Great! Well, where do you want to go? Paris, London, New York? How about Birkenbrunn? - Are you sure? - The people here are ... disgustingly nice. That's my daughter. And? How did it go? I can stay here. The whole mess here ... Was my idea. - Seriously? - Wasn't that the point? You couldn't be evil anymore. So I took over for you. And? Did you have fun? The things you do to keep a friend ... Look ... Ever heard of black nail polish? Thank you. Come on. I need to find Samuel. Looking for someone? She wants to beat up that guy with the hat. No, I'm looking for the blond one. Samuel? He was just here. Maybe ... ten minutes ago. He bought us a round and then left for Berlin. For Ber- ... What's wrong with Greta all of a sudden? She's a teenager. So ... be nice. Do you even know how hard it is to be nice and relaxed all the time? You can do it, pumpkin. So? Fancy shoes. And that's some great make-up. - You think? - Yes. I think it's too provocative. Be right back! See? Our daughter is a sensible person. Great job! It worked! Lilith can stay. - That's really, really great. - Thank you. I'm sorry. What I said wasn't true. It wasn't me. It was ... my evil twin. What do you want me to say? - But I don't want you to leave. - Why? Because ... Because I might ... I think ... I think I've ... fallen in love with you. Do you really mean that? You're a giant freak. I know. But I am, too. Are you staying? Yes. Wait! Do I look as if ... Sorry! You're too young for the Devil's work ... He thinks that ... Sorry, sorry, sorry! The getting-up part confuses me. Oh, sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't know what animal that was. It likes to grow in seaweed. Once again, please. Get ready for the meeting with ... Yes, yes, okay, I'll do it! - Plus 0.7. - How measly is that? Send ... Congratulations! I'm sorry! What sound did I just make? Close the door!
