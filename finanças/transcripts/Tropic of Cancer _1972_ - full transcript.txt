- Here you go, sir. - Thank you. Goodbye and welcome. It's all done. Let's go. Look, there's Columbus. He landed right here. Wait. - Mr. Rait? - Yes? The hotel Rancho welcomes you. The car is over there. Fantastic! I wonder if Christopher Columbus had a similar reception. - Are you crazy? Idiot! - I'm sorry, sir. - Didn't you see us? - Don't know, don't know... You damn irresponsible! Learn to be more careful! Instead of "Don't know". We are very sorry. We'd like to apologize. We are really mortified. - Ripping the van doors open like that...! - You're right, it was a regrettable accident. Would you like to come in? - Hello. - Hello, it's me, Douglas. I got to see you at once. I must have been crazy. - I'm in danger. Right now, please! - Where are you calling from? - Why didn't you call before? - I'm in Rue le Clerc 23. I have the vial with me. I want to give it back to you. - Hurry, or it might be too late! - Alright. Douglas? Douglas! Douglas... You're getting better and better, Adonis. Carry on. Come on, get in before the water gets too warm. There's no doubt about it, your proposition is very tempting. Even if it won't be a piece of cake to convince Williams. He's a strange man, plagued with idealism. A renouncer, a quitter. But when one of my beauties was ill, he saved his life. Right, Scipione? I gave him a stuffed peacock out of gratitude. It was quite a wonderful specimen. Interesting... In any case, this peacock-saver has to be pressured to make the deal. It would be preferable to come to amicable terms. My clients are so interested in this discovery... that no obstacle will stop them. I do understand your clients... but a matter of this magnitude calls for time, caution and tact. But we have to act quick to avoid someone getting ahead of us. We'll do our best. I know this country well, and I know how to handle Williams. A hallucinogen with this erotic potential interests a lot of people. There can't be any mistakes. If someone screws up, he'll pay personally. Mr. Peacock? Alright, my boy, we will take you home. He and my car are at your disposition... - if you need to go somewhere else. - Thank you. Good night. And let's try not to get lost. Right, Adonis? Where's Crotz? Answer me! - Where's Crotz? - I don't know! - I will waste you. Where is Crotz? - I don't know anything! - Come on, talk! - Tomorrow at hotel Rancho. - To do what? - I don't know! I don't know! - Talk! - He's meeting someone there. I don't know who. I have yet to understand your enthusiasm for Haiti. I thought so. It's been a while since you've been enthusiastic for anything at all. You expected the heat of the tropics to rekindle the flame? I actually had this illusion. A marriage can't be saved by a vacation. And a liaison cannot be based on good will alone. Sure... What does your friend do? Lots of things: medicine, biology, illusions... Prepare yourself to meet an eccentric. Eccentric how? Like someone who could have everything but is happy with nothing. Or almost nothing. The sun is no fun around here. You think that your friend could show us around? I don't know. Who knows if he's got time. - Why? - He likes to kill himself with work. Looks like the house of the Addams. - It's a little creepy. - Wait a minute. Oh, Fred, this house is deserted. We'll come back later. Come on! Madam! Madam! Can you tell me when Dr. Williams will be back? - Don't know, don't know. - "Don't know"... These people can't say anything else. What are you doing? Look what you did! Where are your eyes? I was almost standing. Didn't you see that I was standing there? Come on, get lost! Go, go! Oh, Fred, please, let's go! Come here! And what do you know? Where were you? Madame, he voodoo. He magician. Madame, he voodoo. He magician, he magician. - I had to break, didn't you see? - Fred! - No, I'm telling you no! - What are you doing in Port-au-Prince? Williams! You're the last person I would have expected to meet in Haiti. - How are you? - Doing good. - I've been looking for you all day. - You should have told me you were coming. - What the hell are you doing here? - I'll tell you later. Look, this moron ran into me... Oh, and that's my wife. I'll introduce you. Grace, Williams. Williams, Grace. - I'm delighted. - Hi. - I compliment you. - Thanks. That's very nice. And thanks for saving us from the lynching. No, you were in no danger. These folks are very peace-loving. - They're just a little idle and curious. - Oh well... Let's go to our hotel and have a Tropicana. That's a good idea. I'd love to accept, but I have to go to the hospital. I have some serious patients I need to check up on. - Thanks a lot anyway. I'm really sorry. - Oh, I understand. Sure. Listen, we're staying at the hotel Rancho. Why don't you join us for dinner tonight? Come on, say yes. - At hotel Rancho? - Yes. We'll be waiting for you, okay? Okay. - When? - I'd say around 7 p.m. Then we have time for an appetizer. Alright then, at 7 p.m. at the Rancho for a Tropicana. Hello Dr. Williams. How many jobs do you have? Now you even take care of accidents? Hello. Have you heard anything from your assistants? No, inspector. That's just what I wanted to ask you. - We found one of them, Douglas. - Ah, that's good. - Dead, Doctor. - That's bad. Dead in a strange way: The coroner discovered that the blood... has been exchanged... with water. You mean exsanguinated? Right? We're just ignorant policemen. His skin was very pale. Much paler than yours. I've never seen such a pale corpse before. Truly strange. If you hear from your other assistant, Crotz, don't forget to tell me. - Hi Williams. - Good evening. Good evening. Here I am. See that? He disproved me. He's actually on time. Damn it... What was that? I've been bitten, and it hurts like hell! - An animal bit me! Do something! - Get a doctor! - What happened? - Hurry up! Come on! - Go call a doctor! - Don't squash it! Bring it to me. Kill it. Fred! Open this. - I think we were in time. - I'm sure of it. It's very fortunate that Dr. Williams was here. I don't understand it... These spiders are very rare. Especially around here. It seems they can't stand our civilized ways. You are an expert in this. You can confirm it. I've never seen one here before. Their bite isn't fatal. However... it is dangerous. It might cause madness. But as you said, it's unusual to find one here. Unless someone brought it here, right? Yes, exactly. Please excuse me. I will give you a dose of antibiotics. Now get some rest. Thank you. The proprietor of the hotel has a high opinion of you. - Yes. He has a reason to apologize. - Dr. Williams. I can't tell you how grateful I am that you saved me from madness. This in no way makes up my debt to you... but would you be my guests at dinner tonight? I'm sorry, but I'm already invited by my friends. But that's no problem at all. I will invite them as well. Your friends are my guests. If you allow me to make a proposal, gentlemen. This would be the perfect occasion to try our new chef's "Lambic ? Ia creole". "Lambic ? la cr?ole" is the number one specialty of Haiti. The natives believe these mollusks have great effect on men's virility. That's why they offer it everywhere in the streets. Nonsense! I've eaten them for years, and I don't feel virile at all! But we have to admit that these local specialties... are preferable to spiders. Right, Mr. Garner? By the way, I heard that you are an avid collector of spiders. - Did you study them, Dr. Williams? - I studied them for a while. But I gave them up when I realized that their poison... could also poison my existence. Garner's here. This way, please. You absolutely have to visit me at my place. Oh yes, that would be very nice. - Yes. - I'll be right with you. Garner! - Oh, my dear Prater! - What a nice surprise! - A nice surprise indeed. - Haiti seems to be en vogue this year. Much better than the cold in New York in these months. - That's true. - Would you like to join us? No, thank you. I have a better idea: We could have a get-together after dinner. And I'd like to offer a bottle of champagne. - That's very nice. Thank you. - See you later. - See you later, Prater. - Alright. - Here. - Thank you. That's not what I wanted. Speaking of specialties of this place: Something has always interested me... - Yes, which is? - Voodoo. - I'm interested in all things magic. - Voodoo is not magic, it's a religion. It originates from Dahomey in Africa. It's a real cult. - A cult of spirits. - Yes, the lloa. Spirits that communicate with God. It's the lymphatic fluid of Haiti. Voodoo is a reaction to slavery. It can be considered a rebellion against the Catholicism of the French. You want to say against the religion of their masters. The slaves said: "We are Catholic in front of our masters... but practice voodoo when the masters aren't there." So the followers of voodoo wore Catholicism as a mask. As provoked by the Catholics. The Blacks find in voodoo all the answers to the great mysteries of life and death... protection and even healing, love and pleasure. But that doesn't explain the fact that it's usually considered black magic. It's easy to explain, Mr. Garner. This religion is infiltrated by magicians and charlatans who practice black magic... to make a pact with the evil spirits. And these pacts always come to the same end: They destroy those who made them. I really hope that you don't believe in this bullshit. In Haiti you have to be careful not to step on the feet of wizards and witches. That's not so easy... Every Haitian might be one. I never grow tired of this advice: If you don't want trouble... stay away from that stuff. Please excuse me for a moment. - Listen, I need an information. - Excuse me. Can you tell me if Mr. Gordon is back? He arrived last evening. Unfortunately, it's not up to me. - We hardly see each other anymore. - That's true. Make no plans for tomorrow night. Where's Williams? He wasn't spirited away by a wizard now, was he? I'm beginning to fear he was... It's just a joke. Its taste may be arguable, but it's just a joke. Perhaps it is, as Dr. Williams said, just a joke. But as far as I know, the presence of a slaughtered animal... could mean that a wizard will send the spirit of a deceased to kill one of us. Oh, Williams, could you take us to a voodoo ceremony? - I'm so curious. - I'm sorry, I didn't want to stay up so late. Oh no, you're also responsible for my curiosity. Come on, Williams, be so kind. - Would you do me this favor? - Alright. - If you insist. - Let's go then. Hey Garner, your champagne! It's at P?tionville. They are preparing their sacrifice. - What sacrifice? - You'll see. - Fred, I'm nervous. - There's a good reason for it, huh? This dance unites them spiritually with their goddess. Erzulie enters the bodies of her followers. After that they sacrifice a bull. Are you squeamish? That's how they prepare the bull before they kill it. Now the woman possessed by Erzulie will drink the bull's blood. Then the more dramatic part of the ritual begins. What happened to him? He's dead. Go get a knife. There's no blood, only lymph. I thought so. - That's right. But how is it possible? - Things can happen... when a man tries to go beyond the accepted limits... and the spirits punish him. According to voodoo, of course. We can only call the police. I'm very sorry, Dr. Williams... for being forced to use methods like these. I'm a business man, and I detest any kind of violence. My assistant, however... is convinced that this is the best way to shorten a negotiation. I don't have anything to negotiate with you. Did you hear that, Murdoch? Dr. Williams just said he has nothing to negotiate with us. What do you think? Not so hard, you might hurt him. Poor Dr. Williams... Well, can we arrange it now... this deal? I don't do business with you, like I said. You're a bone-head! I'll give you 24 hours to make a decision! And don't you whistle to the police! Murdoch doesn't fancy squealers all that much. - He's better. - Say thanks to the doctor. As I said, the fame of certain discoveries of yours in the chemical field... has already surpassed the boundaries of our little island. My friend Garner even came all the way from Boston. He represents an important chemical firm. - You should be flattered. - I'm sorry, Mr. Peacock... but like I said, at present I'm exclusively a doctor. Everybody appreciates your exceptional skills as a doctor... but that shouldn't prevent you from profiting from the fruits of your studies. The chemical firm I mentioned doesn't worry about expenses. I'm sorry to disappoint your friend... there's nothing I discovered that would interest his firm. What a shame, a real shame. It's sad to see a friend throwing such a great chance out of the window. By the way, did you hear about the murder of Douglas? The newspapers say that his body was chalk-white... Mr. Peacock... like you, I've been living in this country for several years now... and here I managed to find the equilibrium I couldn't find anywhere else. And I want to maintain it at any cost. So I have to ask you not to insist. - It was a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure was all mine. His temperature has gone up, doctor. Let me see. Well? Exactly as I thought. It's useless. He stays closed like an oyster. Perhaps he wants to protect someone. - Maybe even himself. - It's all a bluff. - For me, there's something else behind it. - What? Bring us two rum. Let's examine the situation. Of Williams' two assistants, one, Douglas, is dead... - and the other one, Crotz, disappeared. - Exactly. If Williams refuses to make a deal... he might do so because he has nothing on his hands. - Right? - Right. The assistants, apart from the sample, could also have taken the formula. And there's only one assistant left now... Yes, but he's disappeared. I have the impression that this is like walking on a mine field. Those bloodless bodies... then Douglas and that negro who died yesterday at the voodoo ceremony... And who says that Crotz didn't come to the same end? Thanks. That's exactly your new assignment. So get going. Try to find any trace of Crotz, dead or alive, huh? In the meantime, I'll take care of Williams. See you tomorrow. - Hey Grace. - What? - Do you want to buy it? - No. I was thinking... about the dead man at the voodoo ceremony. Do you think it's true that when the god... If Williams said so... Don't think about it. - Grace! - What is it? Take a look at these wooden statues. Madame, madame! Not expensive. Buy. Buy. Not expensive. Not expensive. Fred? - Madame... - Fred! - Fred! - Madame, buy this. It's cheap. It's beautiful. No, thank you... Fred! Fred! Fred! Fred! You don't need to be afraid of these people. They just want to sell you their goods. Fred disappeared. I don't know, I can't find him. He probably left already. It's easy to get lost here, in all this confusion. Yes, but it's strange. I have this premonition... He was here just a minute ago. Fred's not a child. Calm down. He's probably searching for you now. Erzulie, the goddess of love and fertility. - It's a gift, she brings good luck. - Please, Williams, do something. Alright. Wait here. I will ask around if anybody has seen him. Erzulie. When her spirit chooses a woman and enters her body... that woman will know the secret of life and happiness. I'm sorry, nobody has seen him. That old woman... I think I know her from somewhere. No, I don't think that she's ever left this quarter. Grace, you should go back to the hotel and wait for Fred. No, I don't want to go back to the hotel alone. But Fred probably did the most logical thing and went back to the hotel to wait for you. - Why don't we call the police? - Or the office for lost husbands. Williams, would you please come with me? I feel much calmer with you. Please. If you wish. But first I have to take care of something. - I'll come with you. - Get in. - Where are we going? - To Damien. Stop! Where are you going? I'm Dr. Williams, I have to check the exportation certificates. - Thank you. - Pass. - Why is there a control post? - It was an idea of the old Duvalier... after the attempted invasion of the island. - Hello Doctor. - Hi Pierre! Please keep the lady company. I'll be back in a few minutes. Madam, if you like to come in, the plant has air conditioning. You will be more comfortable. Madam? Thank you. In this section, the animals arrive for slaughter... and the meat preparation begins. The whole process. Here they get hung up and skinned. Then we choose the better parts and pass them... Yes? - Excuse me for a moment. - Sure. He was your secretary, so you should know why he was at the meat plant. Right, Mr. Prater? Listen to me, Lieutenant. Murdoch left the hotel to go to the bank. He was killed in a barbaric way, and you should hurry to find the culprit! We have a homicide at our hands, that's for sure! - Don't tell me what I should do. - It's crazy! We came to Haiti for vacation... and not to become victims of some sadistic butcher. I will not stay another hour in a country... which cannot guarantee the safety of its guests. Do whatever you please, Mr. Prater... Don't get too worked up over your secretary-gorilla. We know about his past, and he's not what we'd call a guest of honor. If you want my advice, go back to America as soon as you can. - Good day, M. Philippe. - Hello. Yes, one moment, please. No, M. Jerome is not here. Hello? No, I don't know if he will be back this afternoon. Hello? Hello New York? M. Chedely, a call from New York for you. You can speak now. - I'll be right back, Andre. - Hello, hotel Rancho. Yes, Rancho. No, M. Lordeux is still talking on the phone, monsieur. Why are you asking me that? Like we have something to hide! Of course we have to collaborate with the police... but I insist that an internal inquiry assesses the responsibilities. Listen, chief, I'm the proprietor, and my good name is at stake... and that of the hotel Rancho. If the killer isn't one of you guys, someone must have certainly let him in. And I want the head of the responsible! Got it? Good! - Hi Robin. - What happened? Murdoch, Prater's secretary, was found dead in Damien. - Murdered. - In the plant? Don't worry, they will find the killer. You think so? You're a sweetheart. How dare you! Can't you knock? Get out! I did knock, madame. Maybe you didn't hear it. I'll report this to the manager. I thought you'd visit other people only when you were invited. And for this visit you left your wife in the lurch. Listen, Williams, I got a proposition for you. You think it was a good idea to leave her all alone in that chaos? You should have stayed with her. I think we should work out a deal. - Your discovery... - No chance! And you better be careful, you're not the only one interested. What are you trying to say? There are lots of others, people who don't joke around. Big figures... or big threats. Yes, the fatso with his friend Garner, I know. But who are the others? Here's an advice, Fred: Get out of this now. It's useless and dangerous. You're in a wonderful country, you have a beautiful wife. Enjoy your vacation. Stop already with your sermons. If you think you can exit this game... you're mistaken! - Yes? - Williams... Williams, it's me, Grace. - Please come to the hotel immediately! - What is it? - I'm begging you, I don't feel well. - One moment. Fred! Fred! Grace... Hello? Hello Grace! Hello! Grace! Answer me, Grace! No! Grace! What happened? Ah, Garner! Come on in. I'm done here. Hello. - You may go. - Thank you, sir. Ithappened what I was afraid of: Someone got in ahead of us. Oh well, it cost him his life. No, my dear Garner, I don't like this at all. And least of all, I don't like your methods! The day I have to leave this world... I want to do so with all my red corpuscles. - Did you find Crotz? - No, nobody knows where he's at. And as I told you, I firmly decided to withdraw from this matter. That Crotz is surely dead, just like his other assistant. Alright then. I wanted to tell you that I'll go on alone. But watch out, Peacock... don't give in to the temptation to proceed on your own... if you want to stay on this world. Fred, please take me away from this place. If I have to remain here for one more day, I think I will go insane! I had this nightmare because they tried to drug me last night. I felt like I'm going to die... And then I had to search for you all day! Why did you disappear all of a sudden? I told you a hundred times, and I will say it again: You're the one who left. I just stopped for a moment... to buy one of the mahogany statues at the other end of the market. You, however, instead of running off with Williams... - could have kept on looking for me. - Don't change the facts. You know that if it wasn't for Williams, I'd still be in the middle of that market. If he hadn't been there... perhaps last night, I would have... Oh my God... Fred, be honest... For all those hours... - where have you been? - Again? Starting all over? So this is your good will? Out of good will I planned to resist to idiotic jealousies. I'm honestly starting to doubt that I can save this disaster! Grace, wait... - Don't be ridiculous. - I've had enough of being here. Understand? If they don't pay, no delivery. Yes, Peacock. Please leave, my dear. - Who is it? - I told you. It's Crotz. I know you've been searching for me high and low. - Where are you? - You know Ibo Beach? - Sure. - Still interested in doing business with me? - What business? - Don't you want to talk about it? - Yes, yes! - I have the sample and the formula. If you want them, come to Ibo Beach now. Behind the tennis court with 30,000 dollars in cash. Yes, I'll be there. Mr. Peacock! Mr. Peacock! - Mr. Peacock! - No! Help! Help! No... no! No! No! Well now, when have you decided to leave? - If you want to leave, be my guest. - You'll always be the same bastard. Do you want this situation to become an armed truce? Excuse me, Williams. A whiskey. Listen, there's something I wanted to ask you, Fred: You're still into deep sea fishing? I remember you were a champion... when we went to university together. Yes. But you were pretty swift with the speargun as well. - Alright, to a peace treaty. - Between me and Grace or me and you? Fred, I don't want you to get into trouble. Why don't you accompany Grace on a trip into town? The distraction would be beneficial for your peace treaty, right? Damn fatso! - Oh, Dr. Williams. - Hello Fritz! Haven't seen you for ages. Tell me, are we in time to visit the castle? - Sure, of course. Please come in. - How is business? Very few tourists. We save ourselves through export. But if it doesn't get better, M. Philippe will have to close. Would you accept a sample of our rum? Yes. Of course, Fritz. That's another reason why we came. - Rum from Haiti, the best in the world. - Try it. - Thank you. - It's excellent. - Isn't it wonderful, this Alexander? - Magnificent. Thank you, madam. If it's okay for you, Fritz, I will show the lady around. Alright? Why, of course, doctor. Make yourselves right at home. - Please. - Thank you. You're welcome. What is this machine used for? Dozens of slaves have spent their lives... under the whip of their overseers to move this device. Sweat, blood and sugar cane to make a good rum. And when one of them didn't work hard enough... he had to spend the day with this gadget around his neck. I'm sorry. - Slavery has been abolished for some time. - That's good. This country has a unique fascination, in its own way. Our civilization hasn't contaminated it yet. I think that deep inside you're actually sentimental. Who knows what success you could have had... in our country? Don't you think so, Williams? Instead, you're vegetating in this earthly paradise. Watch out, Williams! You did that, huh? Didn't do nothing, nothing! Don't know, don't know! Hey pal, tell your boss it's raining rum here. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Philippe closes this shack. It's a shame that you don't love this country at all. Isn't that true, Grace? I don't know... I don't know... I don't think I could settle in here, and... This heat is suffocating. The water is so wonderfully cool! Why don't you come in? It's really beautiful. - You like it? - Yes, very much. Poor Peacock gave it to me when I managed to cure one of his birds. He said: "I surround myself with these beautiful creatures because I'm ugly and fat." For once it's useful to have a whore for a wife. Get dressed. Move! - You're a coward, Fred! - Be careful what you do, Fred. What you have taken from me is extremely dangerous. - And you will never be able to use it. - Listen a minute, Grace. Have you never asked yourself who this man really is... and why he lives in Haiti? Now I will tell you. This missionary here has discovered a powerful drug... which he is trying to sell to the highest bidder... and then plans to take off with his friend's young wife. Isn't that true? Williams, this time it went bad for you! Be careful, don't try to follow me! Hello? What? But when? I understand. Sure. Yes, absolutely. Bye. Who was that? I'll explain it later. Now get dressed, we have to go. - Hello. - Hello, I'm Crotz. Have you checked the documents you stole from Dr. Williams? You will notice that they contain absolutely nothing of what you're after. Son of a bitch! What do you know about it? A lot. The sample and the formula are in my possession. - Where are you calling from? - I'm willing to do business with you. If you're interested, take a motorboat at the wharf of the casino... and meet me at the mill of Delougers, behind the village of Saint-Marc. Don't forget to bring 30,000 dollars. - Alright. - In cash. Okay. - They went to the mill of Delougers! - Get in. It's a matrimonial rite. Interesting, don't you think? Stay here and watch. Wait somewhere here for me. - I have to meet someone. I'll be quick. - Yes. Okay. Hurry. Want some? No. Surprised? They must be here already. If all works out, we will soon know who's been masquerading as Crotz. - We go this way, doctor, it's shorter. - Let's go. I don't trust you. Who can give me a guarantee? How could I trust a cop who wants to push this stuff? - Who could prove that it's good? - You just have to try it. The 30,000 dollars? No, you won't get a cent before I know that this is what I'm looking for. Got a needle? Come here, Grace. No! - Williams. - Hi! Thanks for the call. So far, everything works as planned. Perfect. Now all we have to do is wait and see who takes our bait... and ends up in our trap. I gave Fred a tranquilizer instead of the drug. But how do you know that Crotz isn't the culprit? Crotz could be guilty of one single murder... that of his colleague Douglas. In fact, I found him killed at the hotel Rancho... the night I followed Prater looking for some clue. Our experts always talked about a drug without ever knowing what caused the death. What actually killed them? A substance that destroys the hemoglobin of the blood. Then it's all clear: Douglas and company didn't know that... and were the first to pay. Don't move, Marvin! It was ingenious. It might sound strange to you, but Robin works for me. - And women talk. - I know. That's why I told Robin I'd come here. I used her as a messenger, and you fell for it. But it's of no use for you! You won't talk! Take the gun! Be careful. Freeze! - Get lost. - Stop it, Philippe! Get out of here! Murderer. - Murderer! - Murderer! Bastards! Leave me alone! No! No! No! No! No! Help! Help! No! The flight to Miami. A Pity... Haiti could have been wonderful. Attention, this is the last call. The flight Panamerican number 612 from Port-au-Prince to Miami... boards immediately.
