MURDER BY DEGREE Open up! Come on, Marie, I know for sure you're in there. Open up! Stop it! You'll wake up the whole house. It's useless, I won't let you in. I'm going to smash the door! Then I'm gonna teach you a lesson! Kiddo, you can't just leave me standing here. Just open up for a moment, I'll explain everything to you. You can't be stubborn now. Do you know how I know that you're here? I smell your perfume. Behind the door, so close. I want to see you again. Come on, open up. Come on. Open up. Come on. You said it yourself, it's over. Sure it's over. I now know what's going on with you. Leave that here. You gave it to me. Long ago. Now, we're gonna go to bed one more time and then I'm out. You're such a pig, asking me for such a thing. Leave it. Give me the beer. You're drunk. - It's my beer. - Give it to me! - Let me through! - Come on, quit messing around! - I'll get you anyways. - Don't you touch me! I'll give you a nice souvenir. Take your shoes off my cushion! Why not, all of the sudden? You've always had so much fun doing it. Because I'm leaving? That's no reason. - So just do it! - Come on! Give me a kiss. Come on, give me a kiss. - Oh, come on. - Get out! I never want so see you again. Never! You can't shoot. Get out now! If you were at least capable of shooting. You didn't even cock it. Hey! Help me! What's up? What did you do? Help me! Marie! - Quiet, you'll wake up the neighbors! - What's going on? - Please... for God's sake! - Help! What is... - I didn't mean to, really. - Quick, call a doctor. - What is it? - I'm bleeding out. I'll get you to bed. Wait, I'll get you some pills. Drink. Come on, drink. Drink. Everything's gonna be alright. The Oriental Express from Paris is arriving on platform 19. Scheduled arrival is at 8:47am, proceeding to Budapest at 9am. Please be careful at platform 19. Could you please help me? I have to... 500... Do you want to earn 500 Deutschmark? I need to... You need to take something out of my house later tonight. But you'll have to be very discreet in this matter. Would this be possible? I'm really asking you. (Greek) Do not speaking German. I am sorry. I see... Your son Hans and I are very well. Happy birthday! Love, Marie. One coffee please. Troubles with your man? Here, put this in your coffee. It'll do you good. Sorrow withers. Everything withers. What's important is who you are. You're already old enough. Please? Just a second. One small pale. And a schnapps. Excuse me. Do you need money? Always. I give you 500 Deutschmarks if you do something for me. So? What exactly? What are you having? A whisky? May I buy you a whisky? That's okay, I've got one. You want to sit down with me at the table? Yes, sure. Two whiskies. With or without soda? With. What's your name? Sorry. Graf, Marie. - Marie Graf. - You can call me Guenther. What's up? Are you crying? Here you go, your drinks. Thanks. My boyfriend, I... It was yesterday evening. It was an accident. He's laying in the apartment. I have to get rid of him before my friends return. They're not reliable. The apartment is near Espresso, where I work. We had a fight. He wanted something from me. I didn't want to shoot. What... Is he dead? - Can't you explain it? - I can't explain it to you. Not to me. To the police. No way. This is much simpler. He hasn't been here for long. Only for a few months. He's from Wuppertal, but nobody will notice. Shit, man. Don't you have any friends who could help you? Not them, they are all his friends. They don't need to know. You just need to get him out of the apartment. I'll give you 500 Deutschmarks. One moment. Why me, of all guys? I thought, here, in this neighborhood, I'd find someone courageous. And who needs money. That too, but I don't know you well enough. But when I saw you, I thought that this is someone who is reliable. Well, yes... Such a day, as beautiful as today... - Heavens, these are my buddies. - Do you want me to smash your face? - What do you want? - There he is! We had a little party next door, at the Mathaeser. That's why you ran off. - Waiter! - This is my friend. Waiter! Sorry for bothering you. Don't let yourself get fobbed off, Guenther. This place isn't posh enough for the lady? How much? Just a moment. I hope you'll forget what I just shared with you. One moment...! Please understand, I really don't understand it all. You shot someone, you said? Keep it down. Just leave it, it's fine. You don't need to care. No, no, listen, that's not how it goes. First, you ask me to... Wait a moment. Don't know yet if I'm available today. - Are we leaving? - Just a moment. My mother is okay. My father is a pig. I'll tell you a big secret. Women's genitals are the paradise lost. And how can I find it again? Only through God. And what's the name of our current God? Mammon! And I don't have money! I don't have any money! The mother's okay. - My father's a pig. - Well, that's fine. But there's more... So, where is it? The apartment, I mean. - Near the Harras. - Then we'd better take a taxi. But not now. I need to take a look first. To see what has to be done. - But not in broad daylight. - So when? We have to wait until dark. I see. Then write down the address, I'll come to your place this evening. - No, no, you can't. - You don't trust me? Yes, yes, but... Here's a down payment for you. We can take a taxi then. But I don't want to go there. So we're going to my place. - No. No, no. - I need to shave. I haven't slept a bit since yesterday. Besides, I don't feel like wasting this afternoon away. - Do you want a coffee? - Hey! Taxi! If we go to my place, we have to wait until it gets dark. - We can do that. - The lights are red. Come on. Where to? - Where to? - To the Harras. Of course my colleagues will think I'm doing something completely different with you. He... He just lays there until dark, then he watches TV. Gosh, does he really need to see me? No, he won't mind. He's used to traffic? What's up? It's here. I can't find the key. I don't know yet if I'm in. I gave you money. You can have it back. Are you scared? Where'd you get this thing? Are you crazy? - So, here we are. - Nice place. How you can do that... I wasn't in the army for no reason. - Do you want a coffee? - No, you got any schnapps? In the kitchen. What a mess. Where'd you get this thing anyways? Hans gave it to me. He bought it from a foreigner. He carried it all the time. He felt more safe with it. Did you two beat each other? Yes, a lot. We'd basically killed each other before. Hey! You can't sleep here. I have to lay down first. I'm all dizzy in the head. It's still pretty early. Do you want me to make you a coffee? You need to eat something hearty. You can't sleep like this. Your lips are all swollen. I like you. You need me. What time is it? - Only 3 o'clock. - Gosh... And it won't get dark until 7. How did you imagine getting this out of here? Me? That's your job. - You've got a car? - No, you? Hans owns a car. A Volkswagen. - But I don't know where he parked it. - That's not helpful. Hans took always care of stuff like that. If it was over between you two, you could have easily let him leave. And if he wants to sleep with you one more time, it's no reason to simply shoot him down. I figured you wouldn't understand. - You are all the same. - Yes. You too. You have a passport? Why? Pack a toothbrush and see to it that you get away. As far as possible, somewhere in a foreign country. It's a cold-blooded murder, what you've done. Listen. Either you help me, or you leave right now. I can't leave him here otherwise it'll be in tomorrow's newspaper. So, if you want to help me, do it now before the others come and find him. Hm, very well. I'm going to get a car now. Okay. And somebody who can drive it. What for? I don't have a driver's license. That's not true, I saw it. You were snooping around in my jacket. It fell out. What did you want to know? Well, your real name and stuff. And what's it to you? Before, when I was laying next to you, I was thinking about why you came with me in the first place. No wonder he fought with you, when you act like this. Is this your car? - Yes, unfortunately. - Why unfortunately? Oh God, as an entrepreneur, you have so many expenses that it's not worthwhile to slave away for 12, 14 hours and also on Sundays. It is really a terrible business. I thought it'd be good business. But it isn't a good business. It can be a good business, when you're getting good orders. But... I just don't get them. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Either I have to sleep with the dispatcher, or be there with a bottle of cognac for the head office. Bribe them good, I don't know. - In any case... - Do you have a big trunk? Yes, well, this car hasn't got a large trunk, but if there is really a decent trip that brings some dough, I'll lower the seat and cover it with a blanket and everything will work out fine. I also hired another driver so the car will earn me some money at night. At six in the evening, we always switch shifts. Ah, so the car also operates at night? Sure, that's the idea behind it. Day and night. Just wait a little bit, then Katelbach will come, with his little meat cleaver, he's going to make mincemeat out of you. I need a vehicle. We want to take a joyride. - We could rent one. - Not on a Sunday. Over there, there's the Opel. The one from Monday's accident. - Tuesday's! - The one from the insurance? That's the one. - Unfortunately, not a drop of fuel in it. - No worries, she got money. Let's see if it starts. We don't have the papers. They're in the boss's office. We won't let ourselves get caught. The car will be back here tomorrow morning and you didn't see a thing, okay? Okay. Blocked carburetor. This ride hasn't run in a long time. - You've been working here awhile? - Three years. I was trained here. - Nice working atmosphere. - Yeah, they're alright. So, I need a coffee now. - This... - Yes. And the one with chocolate on top. And two cups of espresso. Unfortunately, we only have bean coffee. Espresso is also made from coffee beans. Well, if you want a stronger one, take the mocha. - Yes, then two cups. - Can you take two little pots? - We don't have cups. - Okay. Lucky at games. The worst thing with this job is all this standing around. But I'm sure I will get fired. - Because I am not there today. - Even on Sunday? Yes, always. The coffee bar is open from 5am. I only have Mondays free. But I've heard it's good money. With all the tips and stuff. Yes, at the end of the month, I have 1000 Deutschmarks. - Don't you wanna call at least? - Nah. They can't find anyone else. Nobody wants to work there. There are only foreigners. That's where Hans got the pistol from. That can't be any good. I once watched a movie about a woman. I think it was Ava Gardner. She was always barefoot. And she didn't want to wear shoes. First, she was too poor to buy any and then she just didn't want to. I'm quite the opposite. When we were kids, we were only allowed to play in socks. Because the landlord lived downstairs and my mother didn't want us to disturb him. And ever since then, I've loved wearing boots. Let's go. Separate bills? - Yes. - Yes. Can I have another 10 pennies? I was allowed to do this when I was a good girl. Don't you have a steady girlfriend? More or less. I can't remember who I was with the first time. But the first time doesn't exist at all. First you are a child. Then you are doing it on your own. Then you aren't a child anymore and you are doing it with friends. But who the first one is or was, these are just fairy tales. Sleeping Beauty and The Prince. Don't know any more who it was for me. I think it was a blonde. Did you feel embarrassed? No, why? Boys always feel embarrassed. But it's only been a year or so, since I really started feeling something. With Hans? Yes. Already before. But with him. He didn't know his father. He was illegitimate. His mother lived in Wuppertal. She is alright but we didn't get along too well. As a Christmas present, she always gave me those glass bowls from Jena. Then I said: "Is this something personal?" You want to get a personal gift for Christmas. The mother just replied: "Take it easy." "You only get something practical from me." "You've got strong hands, you're healthy..." "Buy a cookbook and learn how to cook." Goal! - 1 to 1. - He doesn't have any other relatives? Mh-mh. Not that I know of. I mean, whether there's someone who might look for him. Oh well, I don't care anymore now. The main point is that they won't find him at my place. Although, sooner or later... Normally, this often takes weeks. Can I please have two more? I've read in a paper that all in all only one third of all crimes are solved. Of those, 70% are through denunciation. At least in Germany. Can I buy the whole bottle? You can. That makes 5,90. This is a no parking zone. Because of the streetcars. Here's a no standing zone. Just around the corner, there are always spots. Go on upstairs, I'll be up in a minute. If they find him here, it's even worse. Ah, there's the car key. It's of no use to us anymore. Get the clothesline. And... we are good to go. Get washed. Did he have a shaver? - Over there in the bag. - Okay. What's all this fuss about? You are mean! After all, I loved him. - Or don't you believe me? - We can't change a thing now. Get serious and pull yourself together. I would often lay on the floor as a child. And I would trace patterns on the carpet with my fingers. And the furniture was big and strange. As if it was suddenly alive. I am drunk. But that will pass. Everything will pass. Lucky are those who forget, what can't be... blah blah! Can't you just pull yourself together? Come on, be quiet. You've come so far already. You need to pull through. And don't give up now. One last effort. Me? What am I doing? You are drunk. Don't you see you need to pull yourself together? Me? No, you. You look horny. - Contain yourself. Give me the bottle. - Don't act up. Give me the bottle. Give me the bottle! Then just drink if you want to. It's insane with you. Come here. I want to sleep with you. It feels so cheap if it's only one time. So random. Funny. I used to think about suicide a lot. And now, when I have all the reasons to do it not at all. Did you ever try it? In the meantime, I've learned that you slit the veins lengthwise and not crosswise. How much do you think you'll get for this? For what? I see, no idea. It's not intentional murder. Worst case, it's homicide in self-defense. At least there's mitigating circumstances. Are you sorry you came along? No, why? They don't have us yet. It's getting dark already. Do you know what Hitler said after Stalingrad? No. That man regenerates quickly. Are you being careful? What? Are you being careful? Oh, okay. No. I thought you'd do it. Yes, normally I do. At least I keep record. Well then, that's fine. But I'm not sure today. That would beat everything. I don't think that's funny at all. You're really dragging me into this. Could you at least drive the car in front of the house? What for? So we won't have to carry him that far. No. Sometimes, Hans let me drive, but I can't drive in town. Well, how did you imagine this? Touch him, see how heavy this guy is. - Why's that? - We can't possibly do this on our own. - You take him in front, I'll do the back. - No, no, it's not gonna work like this. We need someone else here. What do you want from me? I don't have any more money. I can't help you on my own. I've got a friend. Normally, he isn't very reliable but here, he'd be game. I am warning you, if you're chickening out, I'll kill you. Quit being a bitch. Get dressed. - Underberg, please. - Can you come out here please? I need to talk to you. Not now. - See, I got a great hand. - Still doing well. Come on, have a seat. I've got her with me. Ah, a new one? No, no, for a while now. - I didn't know that. - Yes, yes. - Hey, come with me. - Let me through! Stay here. Marie! Stay, he's just finishing his game. So? Drive me home! Are you insane? Not feeling well? I'm fed up with it! I go to the police. We fiddled away the whole day, and now you are saying you can't do it alone. My friends will be back any second now. And you're sitting here, playing cards. It's all useless. You can't help me. You just want to prey on me. I'd rather just go to the police. It's all over for me. Over. Out. Great... Well, you're doing some really nice things. You think I'm doing this on a regular basis? - No, I'm just saying... - Watch it, it's a reclining seat! Idiots! It's terrible! Unbelievable... But someone has to stay in the car. Nah. - The janitor is gone. - Okay. There he is. Well, if that's all. I'll carry it myself. Oh. Heavier than it looks, right? Yes, indeed. But tell me, how did you get involved? Stop asking, lend a hand! You were there? I've only know her since this morning. I thought she was an old friend of yours? Are you sure you want to come? We'll manage it alone. If you prefer, you can stay here and sleep in. No, no, I want to do it. Well, let's do it then. Move. Watch it, geez! I am gonna help you. It's too heavy for young people. No, no, it's fine. We'll manage. - But you're carrying it wrong. - It's very nice... You need to use your shoulder! Yes! That's right. - You're already back? - Of course. - I thought you were out of town. - Wait, I'll open the door for you. - That's fine! - I'm still here, - because I looked after the car. - It's alright, we're fine. Pure animal cruelty! Wait, I'll open the trunk for you. Well, it won't fit in here. But we have a reclining seat. What is it? Kind of a floor clock? Yes, you have to be extra careful, it's very delicate. So, now you go in. Yes. More to the right. Well done! It worked. Now move along. Loading is allowed, - more than unloading. - That's a wrap. Where are we headed? Away from here, that's for sure. To the countryside, I'd say. Then take the highway to Nuremberg, I know a place over there. Look at those poor bastards. When they get home, they're already desperately in need of a vacation. Even as a kid I needed vacations. - As a little one? - Yes, in the countryside. Which exit do you want me to take? We still got plenty of time. The farther away, the better! During the seventh drawing of Southern Lotto the following winning numbers have been drawn. 3... 22... 25... 29... And bonus number 18. At least four numbers right! Well, that's gonna be around 50 bucks. At last, there it is. I've been waiting this whole time for it. Now this poor soul is at rest. There's a gas station. Maybe they are still open. With our package? So quiet here. - Good evening. We had a breakdown. - Good evening. We need fuel, too. We have to check the carburetor. You've got some tools? They are locked up right now. We can fix it ourselves, we just need the tools. Is it your gas station? Yes. My husband built it up. So you take turns at night? No. My husband died in an accident last year. This must be horrible. Do you have a plug brush? They are completely rusted. Yes, in the shop. But it's closed. Could you have a look to see if you can find the key? You manage it all alone? We've got one foreman and two journeymen. But they don't care for the business, of course. Well, we just need a plug brush. You could probably get it for us. Alright. Come on, Kai. Come on. Good boy. Come. Come with me, the shop is over here. Have a look at the workbench, to see if you can find anything. Thanks. - Kai! - Shit! Call off the dog! Kai, come here! Piss off, fucking pooch! - Get lost! - Pay attention! Come on, calm down. It's fine. - Behave. - What do I owe you? 14,80 please. Come on, it's fine. Come. Get in, move! Already bright outside. In the countryside, I think, it's always bright earlier. I don't know why. At least it seems so. So what do we do now? If we at least had a box. You can't have everything in life. Guys, don't make fools of yourselves. We should dig a couple of meters deep. You are the one who brought us here. Sure, I know what I'm doing. There's a swamp over there. You call that a swamp? Looks like a construction site. A damn big one. Even better. - I don't get you. - You wanna throw him in there? Of course! It's much better in a building pit, than in the forest up there. - Down there is a hole. - Yes, let's go down. Hans... - We have a great place. - I don't think so. I'd say he's better off laying in the forest, but suit yourself. Matter of taste. We could talk about this all day. Surely it's gonna be a highway. Here he'll likely be set in cement. With concrete pavement on top, safe like a pyramid. Get back a little bit, you won't like this. I think I've seen him before somewhere. No way, he's only been in town for a couple of weeks. Get a move on! Rest in peace. - Let's go. - We're moving. I'll be up in a minute. Let me drive. Then head to my aunt's place, she lives nearby. - We could have breakfast. - We have to go to work, geez! - It's Monday. - We won't manage it anyway. We won't be back in town before noon. You got lice? These stupid tight underpants... Actually, men should wear pants, not women. Would be logical. Yeah, it's the underpants. The Americans have wonderfully loose ones cut like shorts. With a flower print. Not as tight as we have, where everything's stuffy. Plus, it's supposed to make you impotent. Yeah, I've heard that too. So it's best to not wear them at all. You pig! Why? There are even tailors who ask you whether you dress to the right or to the left. Keep the wheel. It drives by itself. Let's see who has courage. Hands off! The first one who grabs the wheel loses. You beast. Are you insane?! Just look where you're heading. Cowards! - Only Fritz. - Nope, I saw your hand too. Look at that gorgeous chapel. Watch out, a curve! What are we doing here? Well, here or anywhere, it doesn't matter. It's nice here, isn't it? I'm staying here. I won't move. These are your friends? That's Guenther. - Hello. - Hello. And my bride Marie. - Hello. - Greetings. That's what he tells me every time. - But this time it's serious. - However, you all look like you could use a hearty breakfast. Guys, in the meantime, pile up the wood and you give me a hand in the house. I always say: young people need to come together. I'm making preserves. It's kind of stupid when you can buy any marmalade. What a mess. Like your face. You look so bleary-eyed. You shouldn't do that, pulling an all-nighter at your age. But when you're young you do a lot of things you're not supposed to do. Here. Just grind the coffee. I'll do the rest. I see what you're doing over there. He's always piling up the wood so everything falls apart as soon as I touch a log. Have you always been this way? Or did you get like this only recently? How? So superior. One thinks you know and understand everything. Hm, that's probably just how it looks. It all seems so easy when you say it. Most things are easy. Yes... out here with you. Well, it's not as easy as all that. You pay a price for everything. - Breakfast's ready? - Yes, yes, very soon. Chop-chop, move! Here are your mushrooms. Are we supposed to eat them as well? I'm stuffed. Where did you find it? In the woods. I feel like laying down in the hay. You want to come along? Leave it, I'll do that. Suit yourself. Go for a walk? I'd rather stay here. Very well, let's go for a walk. Hey, Marie! Wait. You'd better rest. In the hay. Alone with you, or what? Remember to watch out at least this time! What is it? Are you coming? Well, kiss my ass, all of you. Yes, here's Fritz! Hello, Karl. Do you remember me? Yes, sure, you are Fritz! Hello. How are you? Well, so-so. By the way, here... That's my secretary. Look at you. You're going places in the city? Well, a medium-sized company. 10 million annual revenue. What's the news here? Thanks, thanks. Did you already see that, over there? Is that what reeks around here? There are 5000 chicken in it. Makes more money than potatoes. Always 30 pieces under one heater. Every six hours, the light goes out for two hours, then it's daylight again. That's how you live faster. Well, then you're gonna be a millionaire soon. I don't think so yet but with God's help it's going not too bad. And with fish flour. Have a look at our place. Good-bye, Miss. Hopefully, there's no depression, so people keep on eating fish flour. The economy will surely keep up, so the people can still eat. I don't get how people can stand it here. Eating, slaving, sleeping. Come on, don't get annoyed. We all once imagined this differently. I didn't think I would end up as a waitress. And get sent to jail. Why's that? It will come out, eventually. Maybe we shouldn't have put him into the building pit. Get off the road, you hobos! - Relax! - Ain't got a job? - As if someone set your house on fire. - Get moving! Maybe we should actually do that. So at least something happens. Can you imagine what would happen if a village like this went up in flames? With all the hay and straw. And this wind... One match would be enough. Come with me. Wanna torch it? Nope. But? Come with me. So this is what's going to happen. You mind? Wanna try, kiddo? What does he want? Hope they didn't find him. Guenther! Guenther! Wait! If you want a ride, hop in. I'm driving back to town. - Did something happen? - I need to return the car. I don't know. Don't you think we should hide him somewhere better? What? Are you crazy, geez? Back in the woods? You should be glad we're rid of this thing. The old lady! We have to say good-bye to her. Oh come on, the old lady... She doesn't give a damn about nice words. We're loitering here and everyone can see us. Let me drive. You two are really nice pricks! So... Here's your money. 300 bucks for each of you. Here, that's for you. I'll give you the rest next week. I don't have any more money right now. No worries, you can't run from us. Worn-out. Has this guy fallen asleep? Stop tailgating! Geez, I told you to watch out! I can't see a thing. - Don't start bitching! - Pull over now! Watch it! Easy now! Well, here we are! Only things that's missing is the police. These are murderers! You murderers! Are you insane? You drive like criminals! Just have a look at what's going on here! Calm down, nothing happened. Don't you see we got a stone through our windshield? If you had children... But a person like you does everything to not have any! Yes, one wonders how anyone could want to get you pregnant. Shut up, you insolent little thing! - Alas! - Mother, write down the license plate! - Already did it. - Well done. - See you in court! - Don't make such a fuss about it! Here are 20 Deutschmarks so you can repair those scratches. Do you have any idea how much this car costs? Fine, I'll give you 50. Alright then, 100. But that's it. You could easily lose your driver's license. Don't give this pig any money! It's pure blackmail! Did you hear that? The insolence of it! How are we supposed to go on driving? Hitchhiking? That's how you drive! Am I supposed to bring back the car to the shop in this condition, gosh? What are you thinking?! It only has scrap value. You and your big mouth! If you just knew how much this makes me sick! Here! Buy yourself a new windshield! Stop it! - Stop it! - You stay out of it, geez! - It's all your fault! - Get lost! Nice, look at her! She's on her knees. Forget the fucking money! Come on. How about we keep on driving like this? That would be nice. Away from here. For good! Straight to Spain. Why don't we have the courage? Back at school, I had a friend. And we were always making plans how we'd travel to the south. We wanted to go to a deserted island. Somewhere between Africa and America. There we wanted to live, all alone, just us. We imagined the island so clearly in our minds. Ocean all-around, a little hill in the middle with a windswept palm tree. Uuuuuhh... Would you've send me a postcard? Maybe you could have come along with us. We had to think really hard which friends we would have brought. But no more than 15. Just for you and your friend? Actually, I can get out here. I live just around the corner. No, stay. I need to talk to you. Do you need to return the car immediately? We could have a drink, otherwise. The car needs to be back. Don't feel like attracting attention. I really don't know what I'm doing here. Nothing's keeping me here. What? Always the same. Slaving away... And living miserably. You cannot park here, you will get a ticket by the police in an instant. Ah, it's you. - Still, it's not allowed. - We're just getting out of the car. No parking here at all! Now it's rush hour. - Hi, Elfie! - Hello, there you are. Where have you been? We were looking for you at work. The boss was mad because you didn't show up. I thought something happened to you. No, no, we were just in the countryside. I see. Listen, this is Guenther, this is Fritz, that is Elfie. - Where's Renate? - Upstairs. Come upstairs with me. The carpet's gone. Do you have it? We took it along. Yes, for the picnic. - Come upstairs. - Yes, I brought a nice wine. I'll go ahead. See you. I won't come! Why? I need to call the shop immediately. They're probably gonna wonder what the hell happened to the car. You can call upstairs. No, I don't want to go upstairs. So I don't want to hold you any longer. You're not coming either? I don't know. What's the point? There are all your friends and all that. So we won't see each other again? Of course, sure. This town isn't that big. We'll certainly meet again. If not, we'll come by the Espresso bar, okay? I told you, that I really like you. It's true. I like you too. But I don't know, it's useless. Why? I really might want to emigrate. Start anew somewhere. I understand. You're just pretending. It's easy to fool yourself. If you change your mind, you know where I live. What's up, are you coming? Nice girl. Cannot understand why she could kill someone. In any case, we buried him. Hello. What's up? Marie! What is it? Why are you screaming? Marie! Thanks. How long you are working tonight? Till eleven. That's a long time. Do you want to go to the movies together? Uh-uh, that's not possible. And... what are you doing on your vacation? That's not for a long time yet. Do you want to go with me to Greece? On an island. It's beautiful there. THE END
