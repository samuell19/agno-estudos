SSA:Wait for audio trigger The containment of Phildao Island is almost complete. The surviving forces are continuing to retaliate, but it appears we can restrain them. The prisoner count it 17 people. The hostages that were imprisoned, have been successfully rescued. Sergeant Major Melissa Mao is severely injured. I repeat, Sergeant Major Melissa Mao is severely injured. Deep Trap Well, these things happen... Kurtz, Liang... It's alright. You should know by know... Babe is pretty strong. Don't worry about it. Good job. Lieutenant... Yo Iwan, long time no see. What are you planning to do? Planning? What are you talking about? I don't have any intentions of forgiving you. I will not negotiate either. I'll get all the info I need from you, then I'll obliterate you from this world. Oh, I'm scared. Take him away! Yes, sir! Major! Withdraw all troops within five minutes. I have to establish contact with the Americans. Yes, sir! He is not the kind of man to be captured so easily... He may look light-minded and cooperative... but he's a pro. He'll surely think of an elaborate plan, to secure his own safety. But this time, I can't figure him out... Could he be faking? To divert out attention to him, while the main force attacks someplace else... It's a possibility. I've reported that possibility to the superiors... Follow Captain Testarossa's instructions regarding Venom. I leave the custody of that man to you. Total isolation until we need him. Its alright to completely ignore other matters, and deal with him. Even if he suddenly becomes Ill? That's right. Even if he suddenly fakes "illness"... Treat him as you would a dangerous animal. I understand. Transport helicopter number two, landing complete. Hurry the treatment of M-9s and the injured! We will return to Phildao as soon as we refuel! Hurry! She's getting worse! Mao-san! Mao-san... It's alright. It's only a minor concussion and a small crack on her sternum. T-then her life is... A wild horse like her... Even the Devil himself wouldn't be able to take her. Sousuke. Aren't you going to go join the rest of you team? I made a mistake... I can't face my comrades like this. Did... someone die? No... Then what's wrong? Mao-san didn't get hurt to seriously, and... Don't talk so carelessly! Carelessly? I wasn't trying to... If I have been more careless, she would have probably dies. Because of me and that AS! That device... I couldn't use the Lambda Driver. Increasing my mentality and imaging... I don't get it at all! Something that confusing is not a weapon! it's just a useless piece of junk! Whoever made it.. is the worst technician! Why don't you rest a little? You're probably just tired. Even in Helmajistan... then... You were tired right? I heard it from Kurtz-kun. Kurtz-kun is worried too. I'm not tired. But, I don't think that's "Sousuke-like." What do you even know about me?! Don't talk about me being "like somebody" so carelessly! I am just a normal soldier. All I have to do is complete ordinary missions using ordinary equipment! But after that hijacking incident, everything's a mess. Gauln... That AS... Helmajistan... And guarding you! They're all just annoying! Even if it was me... Even if it was me, I wouldn't have specially asked you! If it's all so annoying... Then, why don't you just quit! I can't do that! I'm the only one that can do this mission! What's the mission got to do with it?! It looks like you're the one who's tired... I'm not tired! I don't think you noticed, but I am worried! Anyway... I understand... I understand, so go back to your room! Did you see that? I saw. Sousuke. Stop it, Kurtz! Shut up! What are you doing?! I'm sorry but I had to hit you. I can't stand watching you play the "hero" anymore! Playing "hero" you say? I'm... Just because you couldn't be a hero... You pout like a kid and talk violently to a woman! Guys like you... Become those violent husbands in the future! Do you understand? You bastard! I don't think that is true... As far as violent words, I... You said them, right? You idiot! You made someone good like her cry? You idiot... You're an ass! Just think about what you did! She cried? I understand that it's getting on your nerves, but... There are always things like that, waiting to happen. You're probably well aware of it by now. Don't you already know that much? Are you planning on fighting a war all by yourself?! Don't be so proud! So it wasn't broken? The Venom? Yes. The ECS lenses and a part of the armor were broken, but that's it. There's no danger that it'll move on it's own. There was a self-destruct device, but... It will not operate unless someone touches it. Captain? Ah? Well anyway, good work. We'll disassemble the Venom at the base. Yes, Captain. Maducas-san... Yes, Captain? I need to talk to you for a second... "Within 12 hours from now the toy box from before is nearby your area..." "...Passing a 100 km radius of action" "... can that be where it's located..."? Collect data if you run into the guy?! How the hell are we supposed to find it?! Ah! Damnit! It was a repetition of mistakes after all. The authorities are probably better off not getting their hopes up too high... When I was a kind... I was the captain of a little league baseball team called the "Oklahoma Sailors." And on that team was this kid "Noby" who was no help... I totally ignored that guy by putting him as the eighth batter, and placing him in right field. And ever time he made an error, I'd have him pull his pants down in front of Kathy. Kathy, you say? Seeing myself like this, I think I can kind of understand what Noby would have felt like. On that cold day, guarding his right field position... What an awfully long and boring story that was... You bastard! Are you making fun of my beautiful childhood memories?! You know what, Kaname-chan... It's nothing to do with your problems, but... How about it? You want to eat? That's okay. If you want to sleep, it's best that you go back to the captain's quarters. I don't want to go back. Don't talk like that. Since all you need is a shower and a good night's sleep. To get you feeling a little bit more refreshed. Am I being a bother to you? No, it's not like that, but... Hey, Kaname-chan! Don't fall asleep! But you know what... No matter what kind of monstrous power he has... It's impossible to escape from that kind of position. It's our job to be prepared for anything that could happen. What do you see as a possibility of danger? For example... How about something like this? I thought you were just going to leave me like this. I was thinking about that as well... But my mind was set since the last mission. Don't do it in here. I feel very nervous, so don't do anything in here. Thanks anyway, Mr... Dannigan! John Dannigan! Nice to meet you, John. Don't try to be friendly like that! The people who can call me John have already been decided! So, you're saying "I won't follow any orders from you"? You seem to know it already. My, my, didn't I catch you off guard, John... You bastard! Don't get so comfortable with my name? I won't follow your orders? That just makes things more difficult, John! I... understand! I understand you.. I'm sorry! Is that truely how you're thinking? It's the truth! I won't trouble you anymore! The bridge is this way. The Captain is there. Good, good. Where do you think you're going? I would have never thought something like this would happen... Lieutenant Karinin told me to beware fo the possibility of a traitor. But I would have never thought that a member of the SRT, would... Lieutenant, this is! Go call Weber and the others! Hurry! What is it Gwen? Hurry! So... The other insider was you? That's right. I'm Gewn Bien Bo. So I get a bonus for this right? It's alright to scream, little lady! But if you do, you will be hurt in many ways! Your body might end up being unable to attract men to you. It'll be a bother if she gets annoying. Let's kill her! No. She's a very special person you see... So we can't kill her. If possible, that is... How have you been, Kaname-chan? Is everyone at school doing fine? Don't! Please, don't! There's no chance of winning if we fight against SRT members. This is an order. Just what I expected from the Captain, you know the differences between our two forces. Did you hear that? Everyone, it's in your best interest that you don't try anything. Or something will happen to this very cute captain. Which includes terrible things that minors shouldn't watch! Understand? Kaname-san, are you hurt anywhere? yeah... But a soldier was... Then shall we proceed to the main issue? Ms. Captain... Would you set the course to North 3-3-0 for me? I refuse. Even if I do this? Stop! Don't do it Captain! I won't betray you! It is my duty! So please... Then, why don't you die for us. Wait! Rotate to portside. Set course to 3-3-0. Captain! It's alright if it's only changing the course. Didn't you hear me? Set course to 3-3-0! Rotating to port, setting course 3-3-0! Actually, for situation like this... Where you won't listen to what I say... I also prepared something like this. Could it be! Where did you... Those two weren't the only ones working for me. There are always men that need money. Even within the technician teams of your headquarters... Head quarters? Well it was quite hard finding the guys who would help. But it seem that Mythril is quite a corrupt organization. Welcome, Captain Gauln. Please give me your orders. Thank you, Al-kun. No way... No way! Then, shall we start off with evacuation training? Yes, sir. A fire has occurred in engine room number two. All crew evacuate to the underground evacuation chambers at the front t of the ship. This is just a drill. Why a fire drill all of sudden? Our captain seems to be quite mischievous as well. You can't go, the door is closing! Our guest, Chidori Kaname, is probably up ahead! Please let me go find her! I can't. Anyone behind this door is now considered dead! But! Give up! It's an order! An order... H-hey you! Is it alright? You're violating orders you know. If that's so, then why are you here? The truth is... I basic don't like acting as a group. But, oh well... I thought that someone would come, but to think that it was you... Something's probably going wrong right now. Then shall we go? Yeah! Main door, lock down complete. The vessel's core has been completely isolated. We can't lose...
