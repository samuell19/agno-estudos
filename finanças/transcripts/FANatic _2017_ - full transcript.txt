- Let me go. - Silence. Let me enjoy this moment. - Kal! - Vordo, get down! - He'll never let you have his ship. - Let her go, Vordo! [Vordo laughing evilly] - Oh, my dear Galanica. I'm not talking about his ship. I'm talking about you. - [Tess]: I'm not his possession! - You're right. Now you're mine. [Vordo laughing] - You'd be smart to let me go! - It is pointless to resist. - Nice try, Vordo! - What? [Groaning] - I never doubted you, Kal. - [Man 1]: And cut! - [Director]: OK, that's it for Scene 14. [Crew talking simultaneously] Back for Scene 22 in 40 minutes. - Thanks. Vordo! - [Man 2 on radio]: OK, that's it for Scene 14. [Grunting] - Thanks, bro. - No probs. - [Woman on radio]: Copy that. - [Director]: We need hair and makeup. - See what I did there with my blaster? - What? - I drew it across my body with my left hand and shot. - [Director]: Boom was borderline in the last shot. - OK! - Character's right-handed! - Wow! - You might not be impressed, but the message boards are gonna go crazy. You'll see. - Aren't you worried that people will think you made a mistake? - Or they'll think that Kal had that experimental surgery we alluded to 3 episodes ago. - I think maybe you had that experimental surgery. - Hey, during our summer hiatus, let's go to the cottage. - What cottage? - Our cottage. [Laughing] - Yeah? Where is this cottage? - Hmm, Martha's Vineyard. - I don't know! Sounds expensive! - Look around. We're big TV stars. - No, honey, we are cable-TV stars. Martha's Vineyard is for network-TV stars. - All right, well, how about Marty's Vineyard, then? - How about we just go to a vineyard? I think that sounds nice. - Well, I want a cottage! - Hi, guys! - Hey, Nikki! - Hi! - So, I have the season finale script... - Oh, great! - ...hot off the press. Um, also, I just wanted to let you guys know I have everything arranged for the sci-fi convention this weekend. The suite you asked for is under the name Jacques Strap? [Chuckling] They're going to have your yoga ball, and they're also gonna have the mini-fridge stocked with the sports drink that Hunter likes. Uh, oh yes, and the prescription you asked for is in your trailer. - You're a lifesaver. Really, I don't know what we'd do without you. - Nikki, there you are! Come on, the rest of the cast are asking where their scripts are for the finale. - Oh yeah-- - That's me, James. I had Nikki doing stuff. - OK, whatever. Just get it done, OK? - OK. Thank you. - OK. [Sighing] [Talking indistinctly] [Exhaling slowly] [Sighing] [Nikki chuckling] - [Nikki]: So? - It was so good. - What about that twist? I mean... [All giggling] - I didn't see it coming at all! Thanks for letting us read it. - Yeah, thanks. - Oh my God! I love Kal so much! - OK, guys, remember, you cannot post or tweet or say anything about this, OK? - Yeah, you already told us that. - I'm just saying if any spoilers get out, it'll hurt the show, and then there won't be any more of these advanced readings, and you'll be out of the club! - I started this club. - Doesn't matter. If you hurt the show, you don't deserve to be part of the club. - [Nasal]: If you hurt the show, you don't deserve to be part of the club. - Come on, we gotta zip it. [Hunter grunting] [Tess groaning] - That bad, huh? [Grunting] - In a nutshell, Galanica does something stupid and, spoiler alert, you have to rescue me. So, wait for me to put all that fight training to good use. It's basically the same thing that happens every episode, except in this episode, I'm half-naked for the entire thing. - Well, I like the sound of that! - Come on! I'm serious. - Hey! I'm just happy they still wanna see us naked at this age, huh? - You're part of the problem! - What's the problem? We're actors! We play characters. - Yeah? You play an alien bimbo for 7 years and tell me you don't get sick of it. - I get that you're frustrated, but I also remember auditioning for one line in some crappy movie. I guess what I'm saying is I just appreciate what I have. - I appreciate it too. It's just, it's different for women. We have a best-before date, and I don't want to waste my time playing some character that I'm not proud of. - Is this about that article? [Scoffing] Who cares what the press says about your character? Think about the millions of fans all over the world who love Galanica. - What about my opinion of her? - Well, I mean, if you feel that strongly, better talk to James. - [James]: Yeah. What? No! Oh, come on! Come-- Dan! No, no, no! She has--she has 4 scenes to shoot today. Four! Yeah! I don't need excuses, Dan. I need my stuff to stop walking off the lot! - What's missing now? - Your costume. - Uh, found it! - That's your backup. - Oh! OK, so that's why you wrote in a new wardrobe for me for the finale. - You don't like the space bikini? - Not so much! - A bikini did wonders for another famous sci-fi heroine. - Yeah, in the '80s. I feel like we're going backwards. - You know this has already been negotiated into your contract, right? - Listen. It's not just the bikini. It's that every week, Kal is the hero and he has to rescue Galanica. - Is this about the article? 'Cause I don't see it that way. Besides, she has a kick-ass fighting staff. - Yeah, a kick-ass fighting staff that she uses as a glorified walking stick. - Because she knows that violence is never the answer. - Listen, I'm not asking you to change my character. I'm just saying maybe to keep it fresh, we do an episode where Galanica's the hero and she saves Kal. - Gentilians are a servant race. The females get strength from how they help the males. It's actually a source of strength, not weakness. - OK, have you seen the message boards? Because I'm not sure that everybody sees it that way. - Have you seen our ratings? [Cell ringing] Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! Tell me something good! - He's a producer! - He's a dickhead! - Well, tomato, to-mah-to. At least you got to say your piece. - Yeah, a lot of good it did me. Why don't you do a little indie film, remind yourself what it's like to be a starving artist? - Or I could go to Times Square and be one of those people that poses with tourists for photographs. - Hmm! You could play Galanica. - I already have a costume! - You could charge money for pictures. - Yeah, like $15 a picture! - Excuse me, are you Tess Daniels? - The one and the only! - I remember seeing you as Masha in Three Sistersat the Carling years ago. - Wow! Um, that's not one that I hear a lot. - Well, you were transcendent. - Thank you. - So, what happened? - I'm sorry? - Well, how did you get from doing that to some soap opera in space? It's a shame. - Thank you for watching the show. Have a good night. [Cutlery clattering] - You know what? You're right. You're right. Galanica is a misogynistic archetype, and she is a terrible role model for girls, so... Oh, seriously! [Chuckling] Come on! - Hey! Hey! - Hello! Anybody home? - What are you doing? - Um, I was just dropping off the revised schedules. - No, you're not. Because I have a script revision I need you to distribute, but only to Tess. - Oh! Yeah! OK, sure! - OK! - OK. [Rain pattering] [Door opening] - Hey! Did I leave my blaster in here? Props can't find it anywhere. - No. Have you read the new revisions for the script? - Not yet. Where's all your dialogue? - [James]: I didn't cut your dialogue. Your character contracted a cosmic virus that makes speech impossible. - Come on, James! This is ridiculous! - Ridi-- What's that expression? If you don't have anything nice to say... - So this is payback for that video? - It's funny how it showed up the day after you didn't get the story changes you wanted. - Listen, I was caught off guard, OK? I'd had some wine-- - Do you know how much-- [Talking indistinctly] Do you know how much flack I caught from the network about your stunt? - It's not a stunt! I was speaking my mind. - Then let me speak my mind. I gave Galanica life, and I can take it from her. Screw with me again, and I'll kill you off and replace you with an actress who's younger, cheaper and more appreciative of the opportunity. [Sighing] [Rain pattering] [Door opening] - Hi! It's me! - Hey! What's up? - Um... So, James told me not to tell you, but these revisions I dropped off earlier, they were kind of just for you. - Yeah, that's his shadow over my bow. - His what? - That's his not-so-subtle way of flexing his power and letting me know that if I don't cooperate, he'll kill Galanica off. - He is? - No! No, Nikki, he's just threatening me. - We can't let him do that. - He's not gonna do anything. He's-- He's just upset about that video. - Oh yeah, about that, um... [Chuckling] So, Galanica is not a bad role model. I mean, yes, OK, so, she is beautiful and sexy. I mean, so are you, though, you know? And you know what? I heard what you said, and I'm sorry, but you are wrong. I mean, she is so much more than that. She is curious, and she is sincere. She--she's generous. And, yeah, OK, sometimes she gets herself in trouble because she doesn't understand humans. But I mean, who doesn't feel like that sometimes, you know? [Chuckling] - Yeah. Thanks, Nikki. I really needed to hear that today. - Anytime. [Giggling] OK! I will let you finish getting dressed. - OK. ♪ ♪ [Toilet flushing] - Charmaine? Are you coming? - Yeah. Yeah. - OK, so, where was I? - Tess! - Yes, OK, so, Tess hugged me and said that I changed her mind about leaving the show. And--and Hunter was so happy that I fixed things... [Exhaling sharply] ...he gave me his blaster for my collection! - [Dana]: He's so generous! - Yeah, dude, I can't believe he gave you his blaster. - What are you saying? - That I read a blog post earlier today, said there were a lot of props going missing from the show. - Props go missing all the time. That's why they have backups for everything. - Oh, true, but here is a list of all the items that have gone missing so far, including Galanica's costume and Hunter's blaster just from earlier today. Oh! - So? - It makes me wonder what else you got stashed up there. - Oh my God! I told you I'm going to let you see it, just not yet. - When? - Soon. And trust me, it's gonna be worth the wait. [Nikki chuckling] - I'm sure it will be. - OK, you know what? You don't have to believe me about that or the blaster. You also don't have to believe that Hunter gave me tickets to this weekend's convention. - Shut up! - He also put me on the VIP list for the private meet and greet. - So, we get to meet the actors? - If I choose to bring you as my guests. - OK, I'm sorry I accused you. I don't actually care if you're stealing anything. You just don't have to lie to us about it. - OK, I'm not-- I'm not lying! [Scoffing] OK, do you wanna, um, do you wanna know the truth? - [Charmaine and Dana]: Yes! - I'm gonna need you guys to take the Gentilian Oath. - Is it that serious? - Yes, it is. Orso latek pinuhl tagore. - Orso latek pinuhl tagore. - Orso latek pinuhl tagore. - Orso latek pinuhl tagore. [Sighing] - So, the reason that Hunter's been giving me all of his stuff is because... [Sighing] ...we're hooking up. - You mean, like, sex? - Yes. [Nikki chuckling] - How long has that been going on for? - About a month. - [Dana]: And you kept it from us? - Well, I mean, I had to keep it quiet, obviously. But with Charmaine here saying that I'm the one stealing things from set... What? - Sleeping with Hunter. Really? - Does this oath not mean anything to you guys anymore? - I'd ask you the same thing. - Fine. You want me to prove it, I'll prove it. - Good luck with that. [Door slamming] ♪ ♪ - We have VIP passes under Nikki Myers. [♪ Humming ] - Nothing under Myers here. - Um, can you-- Can you actually just look again? Maybe under Hunter Clay. - Oh! Clay! Clay, Clay, Clay. [Sighing] [Man clicking tongue] Sorry. - I'm surprised he would've forgotten someone so important to him. - Oh! Wait! ♪ Ah [Laughing] Here they are! Nice! These are hard to get. - Yeah! Well, I'm with the show. - Oh! - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Gentilian Oath, remember? You guys cannot say anything to anyone. Ready? - Yes! [All giggling] - All right! - [Man]: Sweet! Thank you! - [Hunter]: Who's next? - Thank you! - You're welcome! - That would be me. - Come over here, my dear! Nice to meet you. What's your name? - Dana. - That's a really great Galanica costume, Dana. - I made it myself. - Wow! That's impressive. You should apply for a job in the wardrobe department. - You guys should have Nikki bring you by the set. - [Charmaine]: She's allowed? - All she has to do is clear it through our producer. - But, Nikki, didn't you say you're a producer? - Uh, production assistant. - Oh, I thought you told us you got promoted, but... [Laughing] ...my bad! - [Nikki]: So, um... - Hey, as far as I'm concerned, Nikki's much more valuable than any producer we have on set. [Chuckling] Hmm? - You said you were going to be a producer. - No, I said I was going to be promoted to producer's assistant. - [Whispering]: What? - Guys, come on! It's no big deal! - Yeah, I know, so why does she feel the need to lie about it? - I'm not lying. - Yes, you are, just like you're lying about your affair with Hunter! - Is that true, Nikki? - No! Charmaine is just being her usual bitch self now that I have given her VIP passes! - Fine, you can have it back! You know, you're not better than us because you are a gofer for the show. [Exhaling sharply] - You're jealous. [Laughing] - Yeah, you know what? I might be if anything you said was real. - OK, look, the job-title thing, that's on you, and I promised that I would find proof about Hunter, and I will. - When? - Soon! - Well, you better, or the next time I see him, I'm going to ask him about the blaster. - Oh! It's him. - Right! - Later, hater. - Hey! - Hey, hey, hey! - One more hour, and you're done for a year. - Yeah. Hey, do you think it would be bad if I skipped the next event? - Why don't you go up to the suite, order some room service... [Giggling] ...get a massage, and I'll come up as soon as I can. - Actually, I was thinking about driving back to the city tonight. - You sure? We got the suite all ready. - I know, I know. I just, I really wanna sleep in my own bed. - OK. Give me an hour. I can be ready. - No, you--you should stay. - Is that a real offer? - As opposed to what? - One of those where I'm supposed to know that the real answer is something like: "No, I'll come back with you." [Laughing] - No! No, you--you have a late call tomorrow, and you should stay, have a good time. - You can trust me. - I know. I do. - I'll see you on set tomorrow. - OK. Mmm! - I love you. - I love you too. [Sighing] [Giggling] - This is a little bit embarrassing, but I've locked myself out. [Giggling] [Sniffing] [Sighing] - Hey!- Hey! - Where are your friends? - They're at the "build your own costume" seminar. - Hmm! - You're done for the day. - Yeah, that's a wrap. - Do you have any plans for the night? - Nothing major. Maybe just a quick workout in the room, maybe hit the tables for a bit. - Cool! - [Woman]: Kal! [Footsteps approaching] I've been looking everywhere for you. - You found me. - Can we take a photo for my Insta? - Definitely. - Do you mind? - Sure. [Woman chuckling] [Camera clicking] Got it! - OK, just one more? - Yep! OK! - Thanks. Um, I'm in Room 408, if you wanna stop by for a drink later or something. - [Nikki]: Yikes! [Hunter chuckling] - Uh, I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah, I will see you tomorrow. - OK. - OK. - Bye! - Bye! [Shower running] [Knocking on door] [Chuckling] - Yes? - I have a message for you. - From Hunter? - No, from me. Just stay the hell away from him, and don't mess with my show. - Your show? - You heard me, bitch. - Get lost, freak! [Grunting] [Screaming] [Woman whimpering] [Panting] - He is married! If you even look at him again, I will kill you! [Grunting, panting] [Groaning] Do you hear me, slut? [Panting] [Giggling, sighing] - [Marlyn]: I have my share of interesting fans, but I'm sure it's nothing compared to what you're used to. - They're harmless, and they mean well. It's just, it's crazy to me when there's someone who knows more about your character than you do. OK, I'm just putting my cards on the table. So, speaking of character, I love, love your play. - Thank you! - Please tell me that you haven't set the lead yet. - No! - I wanna read for this. I haven't had anything speak to me like this in a long time, and I know that I may have typecast myself the last couple of years, but I--I can do this role. - It's just that the producers are insisting on casting someone who'd be available if the run were extended into the fall. - Oh. - And I realize you'll be back on the show, and that's not an option for you. - What if it was an option? - Hunter? [Sighing] [Grunting] [Cell phone buzzing] - Hey, I just wanted to call and say good night. I hope you're having fun. I'll see you tomorrow. [Camera beeping slowly] [Camera beeping rapidly] [Camera clicking] [Camera beeping and clicking] - Still think I'm lying? [Nikki chuckling] - Why are you wearing the wig? - OK, sometimes, we do this thing where he keeps on his Kal costume, and I dress up like Galanica. Well? - How are we supposed to know this isn't photoshopped? - Seriously? What do I have to do, film us doing it? - That would help. - OK, OK, OK. Just take another look. I mean, look where his hands are! I mean, do you think I could fake that? - I don't know. Maybe. [Chuckling] - I mean, you believe me, right? - Yes. [Sighing] - What? - Don't you feel guilty? - No! I mean, him and Tess have an understanding. - I mean, using him for his body. - He gets something from it too, you know. Jeez, what is with you guys? I thought you'd be happy for me. [Door opening] - Hey, babe! - Hey! Late night? - Yeah. I overstayed my welcome at the blackjack table. - Well, I hope you ordered enough free drinks to cover your loss. - Yeah. [Hunter clearing throat] You seem like you're in a good mood. - I am! - Any particular reason? - I don't know. I just got a good night's sleep. Um, I called you last night around 11:00 or so. - Yeah, sorry, I accidentally left the phone up in the room. Uh, by the time I got your message, I just figured it was too late to call, so... - All right, no worries. OK, I'm gonna go get dressed. - OK, see you out there. - Yep! - Um, so, you remember that thing yesterday with my friend saying that I was a producer? I have no idea where she got that idea. - I'm sure it was a misunderstanding. - All right, good to go! - All right, back to it. - What you reading? - Oh, it's a play I might do. - When? - Um, hiatus. It'd just be a short run. - [James on radio]: Nikki, we need Tess on Set 5. - Yeah, I'm flying her in now. - Hey, don't mention that to anybody, even Hunter, OK? - Well, he doesn't know about it? - I just haven't found a right time to tell him. Um, do you have plans later? - No. - I know it's short notice, but you think maybe you could come over and help me run lines tonight? - Yeah! No, I'd love to, sure. - You are such a lifesaver, Nikki! - You have a decision to make. Are you or aren't you a traitor? - But what do you want me to do? - Decide if you're gonna help me or not. - Help you do what? - Get what is rightfully ours. - That was great. - Ugh! - Do you wanna run it again? - No, I feel good about it. - [Whispering]: OK. - Hey, do you want a glass of wine? - Yeah, sure! [Chuckling] [Glasses clinking] - You're a good actor, Nikki! - Really? [Cork popping] Thanks! [Giggling] I've never seen that. Um, it's, like, a 100-episode commemorative, uh, crystal thing. What is that? - Yeah, the network made that for us, for the executive producers and the cast. 100 episodes. - It's beautiful. - Hmm! It's so funny. When I was first offered Galanica, I didn't wanna do it. And my manager talked me into it and swore that the show would only go one season, two, tops. And then I met Hunter, and we fell in love, and here we are, 7 years later. - Well, I am really glad your manager did not know what he was talking about. - Yeah, me too. - To 7 more years. [Chuckling] - Hmm... So, have you watched the show from the beginning? - Yep! First episode. - And sci-fi is your thing. - Absolutely my thing. Um, I was actually sick a lot as a child, and I didn't have very many friends. Um, my brother, though, he had these little action figures from the sci-fi movies and stuff, and I would make these worlds for them to live in. It was... It was kind of like a dollhouse for... for aliens. [Chuckling] Um, a psychiatrist actually once said that it was--it was me looking to gain control where I didn't have any in my real life. And, um, yeah, then I grew up, and I discovered the shows myself, and, uh, found these fan communities of people who are just like me. It was cool! - Any... [Clearing throat] Any of those fans cute guys? [Door opening] Hey! - Hey, girls! - [Nikki]: Hi! - Sweetie, hi! - Hi!- Mmm! Nikki was just helping me run lines for the finale. - Yeah! Just getting those lines down. - Cool! - You're home early! - Yeah, they shot me out so we could try to make that premiere. - Oh, I forgot! I totally forgot! Oh, Nikki! I'm so sorry. I hate to cut this short! - No, don't. No, no! Don't worry about it. - Oh! - I have to go, anyway. - OK.- Sorry, Nik. - No problem! - Thank you! - No problem at all. - Well, thanks for coming over and helping me. - Yeah, for sure. See ya! - OK, bye, Nikki! Thank you! - Bye! [Car honking] [Cars honking in distance] [Sighing] Oh, Nikki, what would we do without you? - [Charmaine]: Can you show us the room? [Car honking in distance] - So, Charmaine, now do you believe me? - Yes. [Sighing] - I actually can't talk too long 'cause he's just in the shower. - Can I see him? - What? - Just through the shower curtain. - No, you perv! [Chuckling] - Which side of the bed does Hunter sleep on? - I actually don't know. We don't do a lot of sleeping. [Charmaine scoffing, Dana sighing] He's actually just getting out of the shower now. I gotta go. Bye. - Wait! - Oh! Come on! [Shower stops running] [Door closing] - [Hunter]: Can't believe we got out of there. [Tess and Hunter talking, indistinct] - This way you don't have to lie about whether or not you liked it. - You know, I was thinking, after we wrap the season. instead of the cottage, maybe we get on a plane, go somewhere exotic? - Hmm! - I figured you wouldn't mind as long as it's hot and the show's not syndicated there. [Chuckling] - Well... I don't know if I can do that. - What do you mean? - There's a play I wanna do. - Really? Which one? - Marlyn Trask's new piece. - Wow! Fancy! I mean, that'll be a good use for the hiatus, you know? Come back recharged, and you can come slumming with us in sci-fi again. - Well, I don't know if I'm coming back to the show. It's such a great role, and they will only consider me if I'm available to do an extended run in the fall. [Scoffing] - When were you gonna tell me? - It's just it was supposed to be over hiatus, and I just found out about this fall-schedule thing last night. - Is that why you left the convention early and asked me to stay? - I had to talk to Marlyn. - You lied to me. - I just didn't wanna make it something until I know it was real! - And it's real now? - No! - But you want it to be. - I don't know! I don't know if I can do another season on our show. I don't know if I can work with James. - Oh, come on! James is not the only part of the show. There's us too. - Yeah, well, I'm easily replaced. Come on, you know that's not true. We're a classic TV couple. - Yes, and we will always be together in reruns. - What is that supposed to mean? - Come on! These things always come to an end. What does it matter if it's now or later? - What do you mean, what does it matter? You know we get paid for this, right? - This is just about the money for you? - No, it's not about the money. It's about the job! I like the job. It's the best job I've ever had. And I know it's not perfect, but when are we gonna have the chance to lead our own series again? Never. - Honey, you're gonna keep working. - Yeah, guest spots, sci-fi conventions. 'Cause let's be honest, I'm not one of those actors who gets offered plays by famous playwrights. - Oh, come on. They haven't offered it to me. - Well, when you make a decision that affects the both of us, please let me know. [Cars honking in distance] [Siren wailing in distance] [Whispering indistinctly] [Man 1 laughing] - [Man 2]: Get me some more tapes. [Cell phones buzzing] [Woman laughing] [Crew whispering, indistinct] - [Whispering]: Oh, is that what you think, Vordo? If you even so much as look at Galanica... - Something's going on. [Man laughing] [Grunting] - What is it? - You tell me. - It must have been photoshopped. - Did they photoshop the birthmark on your shoulder too? I can't believe you. - I'm not lying to you. - Don't talk to me. - I swear I went up to the hotel alone. - Let go of me! - I did some pushups, and the next thing I remember, I fell asleep. - With some groupie wearing a Galanica wig! - I must've been roofied! - You are telling me this now? - Because I didn't know if anything happened, and I didn't want you to think what you're thinking now! - I'm not thinking anything! I am looking at it! - I didn't know I slept with someone. - You really think I'm that gullible? - Tess, I'm not lying! - You know what? You screwed around and you got caught! I would at least have some respect for you if you would just own up to what you did! - Tess! [Woman clearing throat] [Crew talking, indistinct] [Cell phone buzzing] [Sighing] [Whispering indistinctly] - Do we know who it is? - Does it matter? Hunter's so screwed! [Laughing] [All laughing] - It wasn't me. - You guys are the only ones I showed it to. - Maybe your computer got hacked. - Maybe you're a liar. - Or maybe you shouldn't take photos like that if you don't want people to see them. - Nikki, she took an oath. It couldn't have been Charmaine. - If I find out you did it, you're dead. - Well, if anyone finds out it's you in that photo, your career is dead. [Sighing] [Door opening] - OK, the crew's waiting. We need you back on set. - I--I can't go out there, James. - You assured me, Tess, that your personal life wouldn't get in the way of what we're doing here. - Well, you had no problem with the press the show got when Hunter and I started dating. Come on! Just, please, shoot around me today. - You're in every scene. Please. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry. Well, I'm sorry to be so blunt, but as you've pointed out, Hunter is the hero. If you guys can't find a way to work together, I'll have to write you out. - I think you should probably do that. - Don't say something you're gonna regret. - I'm not. I think 7 years is a great run, and... [Chuckling] ...it's not like you're gonna suddenly give my character some substance, anyway. - What makes you so sure? Because you'd have to have some substance first, so... [Chuckling] - Fine. I'll write you out of the finale tonight. - OK. [Sighing] [Sighing] Nikki! Hey! Listen, can you give me a ride home? I--I really don't wanna ask transpo. - Yeah, no, of course! Uh, yeah! - [Whispering]: OK, thank you. [Cars honking] - Are these guys here for you? - Probably. - What do you want me to do? - Just keep driving, please. Just drive. - Where? - I don't care. Just somewhere where nobody cares who I am. - Got your room key. - Ah! Thank you so much! - Look, are you sure this place is OK? - It's great. I just need someplace where I can lay low and then just, you know, get my thoughts together. - OK. - Oh, thank you! Hey, thank you so much for putting it on your credit card. I mean, the last thing I need is some employee selling my location to a tabloid. You know I'm gonna pay you back. - Oh my gosh! No rush. And do you want me to run out and grab you anything? - No, no, no! You've done so much already. And, hey, I saw James's message... ♪ ♪ [Cameras clicking] - [Paparazzo]: Hey, Hunter! What you got to say about the photo? - It's a big misunderstanding. - Didn't they shut down production? Come on! [Cell phone buzzing] [Knocking on door] - Oh! Nikki, hey! - I brought supplies. [Both chuckling] [Cell phone buzzing] Is that Hunter again? - Yeah. He keeps calling. - I'm so sorry you have to go through this. - There's nothing for us to talk about if he doesn't stop lying. - Well, what's he saying happened? - He's saying he doesn't know. He's... [Sighing] He's claiming alien abduction. - I mean, it's possible, right? - It's not the first time this has happened. - What? - Last year, at the convention, we had this... [Tess sighing] ...this horrible, horrible fight, and Hunter got really drunk, and he slept with a fan. - How did you find out? - He told me, eventually, after making me feel like I was crazy for suspecting it. He said he felt guilty. He... I don't know. I think he was worried she was gonna take it to the tabloids, and he wanted to get ahead of it. We worked through it. I don't know. I said our marriage came out stronger for it. [Chuckling] - OK, you know what? Even if you guys can't work things out, I know that you're gonna be able to find a way to work together for the sake of the show. - I'm not coming back to the show, Nikki. - You're--you're too emotional to make a decision like that right now. - Well, it's not just up to me. - Who, then? - James! He's writing me out as we speak. - He's killing off Galanica? OK, well, we have to stop him, then. - No, we don't. - Yes, we do! You don't get it! - Nikki! - Well, what about the fans? - Well, the show will continue! - Yeah, but it won't be the same, not without Galanica! - Listen, I--I love that you love the show, but I--I have to do something else now. - What? That stupid play? - Hey! Why are you acting like this affects you? - Because it does affect me! Orpheus Moonisn't just a show! It's a way of life! - Well, I have to think about my life! - Can you stop being so goddamn selfish? - OK, I'm... - You know what? I'm... [Chuckling] I'm just gonna give you some time... - Yeah. - ...to think about things, OK? [Crickets chirping] Hello! - What? - Hi, Mr. Douglas. Sorry to bother you. - Hi! - Um... - Uh, what are you still doing here? We sent everyone home. - I came back, um, to talk to you. - OK, make it quick. I'm kind of busy writing out a main character. - Yes, that is what I want to talk to you about. Um, you can't kill her off. - I can, and I already have. [Clicking tongue] - Tess actually asked me to come in and see if you would reconsider. - You're kidding. - Nope. She would've come in herself, but she was too embarrassed after everything that happened today. And, uh, she thought that sending someone else in to help smooth things over would be a good idea. - So, she asked you? - Yep! Well, she trusts me. And she knows that I know how much Galanica means to the fans and how much it would hurt them if you killed her off. I mean, there would probably be write-in campaigns and boycotts. And, I mean, it would just be a huge mess for everyone involved. - If I ask Tess to come back, is she gonna listen to me? - Yes. She wants to work with you. She--she said that 7 years is just too much history to turn her back on. - Tess staying on this show means a lot to you, huh? - More than anything. - Prove it. - How? - Take off your shirt. Guess you don't want it as much as you thought. [Sighing] [Sniffing] - I'm sorry. I can't! I can't! I'm sorry. Um... - Uh, then--then get out, and don't come back tomorrow. - What? - You're fired. - Why are you doing this? - I get more than enough drama from the talent. I don't need it from the help. Plus I'm sure it'll piss off Tess. Go, get out of here. It was you. - You can't tell him. - Wait, he doesn't know? You really did drug him. [Beeping] - No, don't. Please just don't! [Groaning] [Nikki and James grunting] [James stops grunting] [Panting] [Crying] [Sobbing] [Screaming] [Sobbing] [Car honking in distance] - Nikki, how'd you get in here? - I have some bad news. James Douglas is dead. - What? - I just got a call from production. They don't know what happened, but I thought I should let you know. - Oh my God! - I know this might be in bad taste, but at least now you can go back to the show. - What are you talking about? - James is gone. There'll be a new producer. You can make the changes you wanted to. - Nikki, listen. I am not coming back to the show. - But this fixes things. No, it--it's not just him. I can't work with Hunter anymore, either. - But... [Sighing] You said the last time he cheated, you fixed things. You could just do it again. - Oh, it is--it is not that simple. I'm-- I'm done with--with the show. I'm done with Hunter. I'm done! I'm just, I'm done! - Have you spoken to Hunter? - No. [Wine pouring] - So nobody knows where you are. - No. [Scoffing] [Cap creaking] [Grunting] [Car beeping] [Grunting] [Drill whirring] [Groaning] What? [Scoffing] [Blowing] - Hi, Tess. - Nikki? What is this? - I--I know you're upset, and you have every right to be, but I just need to do what's best for the show right now, OK? You just need a little time to think things over. I mean, with everything that happened, you're just-- You're acting a little irrational. - I'm acting irrational? - Yeah. - Are you taking me hostage? - No, you're not a hostage. You're just staying here until you can get some perspective. - OK, you know what? You--you gotta let me out. - What? [Grunting] Do you see this? This, I built this because I love the show more than anything and there are fans all over the world just like me who need Orpheus Moon! I brought you here to show you that. - Nikki, you've dressed me in my costume! - Yeah, to get you back into character! - OK. Yes. Yes. I--I see that now, and I thank you, and now I have to go. - Come on, Tess. You're a better actor than that. - OK. It's not too late. If you let me out right now, I will not breathe a word of this to anyone, I promise you. - I have a responsibility to your fans. - So, what? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna keep me in here for a week? And nobody will have seen or heard from me, and they just cancel the show. Is that what you want, huh? - Let's hope it doesn't come to that. But I actually do have to go. Sorry, but I will be back. - What? - And you know what? I left you food and a bucket and, yeah, so... - No! Nikki! Come on! - I'll be back soon, I promise, OK? - Come on, Nikki! [Retreating footsteps] Nikki, come on! Nikki! [Man on police radio, indistinct] [Exhaling sharply] [Siren wailing in distance] [Woman on police radio, indistinct] ♪ ♪ - What happened? - James Douglas was murdered. - Oh my God! Well... [Scoffing] Do they know who did it? - I don't think so. [Grunting] [Cell phone vibrating] - Tess, I know you're upset, but we need to talk. Please give me a call back. - Oh my God! Can you believe this? - I am in total shock. - Ugh! - Do you know where Tess is? 'Cause she didn't come home last night. - Oh, yeah, I dropped her off in front of your apartment last night. - You watched her go in? - Yeah! Yeah, no, she--she hurried in. I mean, there was tons of paparazzis outside. - She must've left before I got there. [Sighing] - I mean, look, don't worry about it. I'm sure she just needed a night alone to think about her options. - Just so you know, I didn't cheat on her. - I know. I mean, I believe you. - Really? Because you might be the only one. - Maybe--maybe if you just told her that you messed up and you were sorry, that maybe... - [Officer]: You'll have to go around. - I don't know. It could-- It could change things. - You're kidding, right? [Siren wailing] [Chuckling] - I know it isn't fair, but I mean, isn't the most important thing saving your marriage at this point? - I'm not gonna confess to something I didn't do. - OK! - OK. - Yeah. Sorry. [Sighing, sniffling] - Ugh! Ugh! - [Charmaine]: He used to work there. - Oh yeah! - It's really nepotism. - I know, it works like that all over the world, not just with our little... - I can't even serve with a smile under the circumstances. It's just not possible. Where is she? - I don't know. - Nikki? - Hello? - Go, go, go! Hustle, hustle, hustle! [Giggling] - Do you think we should? [Scoffing] [Gasping] - What the... - Hey! Nikki locked me up in here. You gotta help me out! - Oh my God! [Gasping] [Gasping] Dude! - What should we do? - Let me out! - Uh, let her out, obviously. - OK! - Open the door! - Um... Hi! - Oh, hello! [Chuckling] - Is there, um, is there, like, a key anywhere? - Nikki must have it! - OK, uh, well, hold on. We're gonna get out of here. - [Nikki]: What are you doing here? - You weren't here, and the door was open, and we have a meeting tonight. - Right! Sorry, I... With everything going on, I just totally forgot. - Everything going on being what, exactly? Kidnapping Tess Daniels? - You wanted me to fix things, and that's what I'm doing! - Nikki, come on! Let me out! - OK, this is crazy. Give me the keys. I'm letting her go. - No! No, no, you're not. - Nikki, what are you doing? - What you told me to do! [Chuckling] - This is crazy. Put the dagger down. [Chuckling] I think you might be losing it a little. - OK, OK. You just have to hear me out, and--and you'll understand everything. - You don't need to explain anything. You just need to let her go. - Well, I can't do that right now. - OK. Well, then, I am calling the police. - Yes! Thank you! - Come on, Dana. Let's go. - Dana? Dana? Just take this, all right? Take it. I'm gonna go talk to Charmaine. You do not let her out, OK? Promise me? - Gentilian Oath. - Charmaine, wait! - Orso latek pinuhl tagore. - You told me to fix things! - I didn't mean for you to commit a felony! - No, I have a plan. You just don't understand yet. - Tess saw me. If I don't do anything, I'm an accessory to kidnapping. - Tess isn't going to be mad at you. She is going to thank you. - Why? - Because she is going to realize that we stopped her from making a huge mistake! - Oh my God! I always knew you were weird. I didn't realize you were delusional. - This is your fault! - What? - If you just hadn't leaked that photo of us... - For the last time, I didn't leak the photo. [Chuckling] - You're jealous. - Yeah, that's right, Nikki. You've got it all figured out. [Both grunting] [Groaning] [Whimpering] Nikki! [Sobbing] Please! Please! [Neck cracking] - I think that you should let me out before Nikki gets back. - I'm sorry, but I can't. - OK. What if you let me out, and then I get you a role on the show? - With Hunter? - Yeah! Yeah! Well, whatever you want! - That would be awesome, but I took the Gentilian Oath. - OK, that is something that a writer made up! It--it doesn't mean anything! - Oh, it means something to me. - See? The show means something to everyone but you. - Come on, Nikki. You gotta let me out of here. - I will... once you've learned to truly play your part. [Sighing] - [Dana]: What did Charmaine say? - She's on board. - Good. Where is she? - She went home, since the meeting's postponed. [Dagger clinking] Let's go. - Hunter, you definitely have a type, huh? - How long are you gonna camp out here, man? - Till I get a shot of Tess. - You didn't get enough? - Nobody's seen her since the story broke. - What? - We've had someone camped out here since that photo of you went up online. [Paparazzo chuckling] [Doorbell buzzing] [Cell phone buzzing] - Who is it? - I think it's Hunter. - Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Here. Can you go watch over Tess for me? - Why can't I see him? - Um, just... Just listen to me, OK? - OK. - OK! [Pounding on door] [Sighing] Hunter! Hey! - Where is she, Nikki? - Who, Tess? - You lied to me about dropping her off at the apartment. Is she in here? - No, she's not here. - Let's see. Tess! - Hunter, I told you she's not here. - Tess! - Hunter! - Move. - Hunter, just wait, OK? Can we just talk about this for a second? Let me explain for a second. - Tess? - OK, yes, she's here. She's here, OK? And she's fine, but you just need to give me a second. - Where is she? - I will bring you to her, OK? I promise. - Nikki... - No, just wait. Wait, wait, wait. Dana? Barlok nagulGalanica. Da! Parluk kow. Da.OK. - Were you just speaking Gentilian? - Yeah, sometimes it's just easier. - Than what, English? - This is all gonna make sense in just a minute. - Tess! Tess! [Panting] You OK? - Yeah, yeah, no. No, no. She's fine. - [Hunter]: What are you doing? - I know you're freaked out, and I understand. But you just gotta trust me, OK? I'm actually gonna need you to get in that box. Um, and... [Giggling] Put this on. - [Tess]: Come on, Hunter. Hunter, come in. OK? - [Whispering]: Go. - It's OK. - Get in. - It's OK, Dana. It's OK. - Dana? - It's OK. You don't really wanna hurt me, OK? [Breathing heavily] It's OK. Everybody's OK. Just... OK, don't do anything. - Go! - Nikki! - Come on, Nikki! Come on! [Panting, laughing] - You're fired! - Hi, Hunter. Do you remember me from the convention? - No! - We met. I took a selfie with you, and I use it for the wallpaper on my phone. - OK, Dana, that's enough. Can you get changed, please? - Just do it. - What do you want, Nikki? - I don't want anything from you. I'm doing this for you. - What? - You don't want Tess to do the play, either, right? - What? - When that photo was leaked, she said she was gonna leave you and the show. I mean, she was acting impulsive, so I--I just thought I would keep her here so she didn't do anything she regretted. - So, this is your psychotic version of a time-out? - No, no, no. No, no, no, no. This is me risking everything, putting everything on the line for the sake of the show and your relationship. [Nikki chuckling] - Nikki just wants what's best. Me too. - OK. Hey, I know what you're doing. You did this for us. - Yeah, I did. [Sighing] - Thank you. Would you let us out now? - That's not gonna work. - No. No, not yet, not until you work this out. But now that you're together, you can do that. - Nikki, please! - You know what? I--I know your chemistry. I know the way that you look at each other, so don't try to fake anything, 'cause I'll know. Come on, Dana. Dana? Come on. - How did Nikki get you in here? - She hit me on the head. It still hurts. - That's the same way James died. - [Dana]: Why are you trying to get them back together? - Because it's what I have to do to save the show. - But I thought you wanted to be with Hunter. - No, that was just a fling! What's important is the show! - He didn't seem to look at you weird or anything. - Weird? - You know, the way you do when you like somebody. - What are you getting at? - I don't know. I mean, did you really have an affair? - I took the oath, didn't I? What more do you want me to say? - OK. Fine. - [Hunter]: What do you think she wants from us? - I don't know. It's hard to say with a crazy person. My guess is she doesn't want Mommy and Daddy to get a divorce. - Well, I don't want that, either. - Yeah, well... - Seriously? You're gonna stay mad at me? - Do you really think because some fanatic abducted us, I'm just gonna forget that you screwed around on me twice? - Tess, I didn't cheat on you! - Explain the photo! - I can't! - Exactly! - But I'm not going to admit to something I didn't do. If anyone cheated here, it was you! - Excuse me? - You didn't tell me you were gonna leave the show. - I was just thinking about it! - Come on! - No, OK, the only reason that I even contemplated staying was because of you, and that is the same reason that I have stayed for the last 7 years. - There it is. You resent me for making you stay at a job where they pay you 7 figures, where everyone kisses your ass. I'm so sorry, Tess. - No, no, no. No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that, yes, I want to be an actor instead of a TV star like you. I'm sorry that I wanna play a role that challenges me and do work that excites me. And I am sorry that our industry is filled with sexism and ageism and I am typecast more by the day. And I am so sorry that I want this to end! [Slaps thigh] - The show or us. - [Whispering]: Both. [Siren wailing in distance] [Cell phone buzzing] [Approaching footsteps] [Sighing] - So, I guess you guys didn't work it out yet, huh? - You can't just lock us up in here and expect us to forget everything that's happened. It doesn't work like that, Nikki. - OK, well, um, I might have some information that will help, then. Tess, Hunter isn't lying when he said that he wasn't cheating on you. - How do you know that? - It was me in the photo. - What? - You drugged me? - I gave you some of Tess's sleeping pills, and then I snuck in and took the photo. That's all it was. - Why would you do that? - I was trying to prove something to my friends, and I told them that we had an affair. And I didn't mean for it to get out of control. I didn't mean for anyone to see the photo, I promise. But Charmaine must've just leaked it to humiliate me. [Sniffling] I am so sorry. And I'm telling you now so you guys can go back to the show even though it means that I can't. [Crying] The show means everything to me. And I just need Kal and Galanica back together. So, please, you guys can be mad at me. Just please don't be mad at each other anymore, OK? [Sighing] - [Whispering]: I'm sorry. - [Whispering]: It's OK. - [Whispering]: So sorry. [Breathing shallowly] - [Dana]: You're a liar! You're a liar! - [Nikki]: Dana? - You--you broke the oath? - No, no. Charmaine had me backed into a corner. - Where is she? - What? - The restaurant called, and she didn't show up to open. What did you do to her, Nikki? - Nothing. [Scoffing] - How can I believe anything you say? - Dana... - No! You're a liar. And I am so glad you weren't really having an affair with Hunter, because he deserves so much better than you. - Who? You? [Scoffing] [Doorbell buzzing] We'll work this out, OK? [Sighing] - Dana? - Dana! Dana! [Pounding on door] - Yes? - Nikki Myers? - Yeah. - Detective Paulson, NYPD. I was wondering if you could answer a few questions about Tess Daniels. - Yeah! No, sure! - Well, do you think we could chat inside? - Yes! Of course! After you! - Dana, Nikki lied to you! Listen, I hear the way that she bosses you around! She dragged you into this! - I don't want you to go to jail for something that's not your fault. - No! - Why would I go to jail? I haven't done anything wrong. - Not if you let us out! You know, we're gonna need a new assistant on the show. - You mean me? - Yeah! I--I mean, if you want the job. - I don't wanna be your dumb assistant. - OK, well, maybe something else, then. - So, when was the last time you saw Tess? - Um, a couple of days ago. I drove her home from set. - Mm-hmm. Drop her off at her apartment? - Yeah! Yeah. - You haven't seen or heard from her since? [Sighing] - No, sorry. I wish I could be more help. - That's funny, 'cause it went out on the news that we were looking for her. Motel clerk called in a tip this morning, said that she was staying there, and, well, it was your credit card that checked her in. - I was going to drop her off at her apartment, but there was too many photographers outside, so I drove her to the motel. - And that's the last time you saw her. - Yes. [Laughing] - Well, we're also trying to track down Dana Romley. - What for? - Well, she uploaded a photo to the Internet that, well, could have something to do with this. We just had a few questions for her, that's all. - No, sorry. I--I haven't seen Dana, either. - I thought you were supposed to be quitting the show. - I--I changed my mind. Nikki convinced me that that was a mistake. - I don't think that it is. I think you should quit. And I think you should go. - Is there anything else? - No. No, you know what? That's it. - OK! - Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. - Oh no! No problem at all. [Sighing] Let me know if you hear anything. - Yeah, we will. - I think you should leave too. - What? - Yeah. It's not gonna work out between us. It's clear you don't love me anymore. - Oh! I guess if that's how you feel, then I guess you're right. Yeah, I should probably go. - Dana? What are you doing? - She wants to go, she should go. - No, no, no! Don't you dare! - I am done taking orders from you. - I trusted you. I trusted you with that photo. I know it was you and not Charmaine who leaked it. - Whatever, she needs to leave now. - [Hunter]: Watch it! - Oh! [Screaming] - Hunter! Oh! [Hunter groaning] Hey! Look at me! Look at me. Hey! You're OK! You're OK. Why did you do that? [Tess talking indistinctly] OK, just stay there. Just stay there! No! No, don't! Don't close your eyes! Don't! No! - I was-- I was gonna let you go. [Tess sobbing] None of this would've happened if you'd just listened to me. I've-- I've sacrificed everything for you guys, and... [Sobbing] ...no one seems to care! - OK, Nikki, listen. It's not too late. We have to get Hunter to a doctor, OK? Nikki! - No. If you want the show to end... let's do it. Let's end it right here. - What are you doing? - Giving Galanica the end she deserves. [Both grunting] [Screaming, grunting] [Grunting] - Are you with me, Kal? - For about 20 more seconds, unless he gets what's in this vial. - What is that? - It is my insurance policy, otherwise known as a cellular antidote to the clone virus I put into him. - What's preventing me from slicing your throat and taking it right now? - See, that's where the cellular part comes in. It's cloned to my tissue. [Inmate giggling] So, if I die, so does the antidote. [Inmates laughing] [Chuckling] - Hey, hey, hey! This show wouldn't even be on if wasn't for me, OK? - So, you got a decision to make. Kill me or save your boyfriend. [Vordo breathing heavily] [Sighing] [Knocking on door] - Come in. - Hey, what's up? - Have you seen the wardrobe they put me in for the slave scene? - No, what is it? [Chuckling] Wow! Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna just... [Lock clicking] Hang on a second. I think that you should be proud that they still wanna see us naked at our age. - Ha, ha. - And I think that we look good. I think we look really, really good. - I gotta go back to set. - No, we have a few minutes.
