Hey, Akaba. I want you to tum in a story on... the hot and steamy happenings of a dating tour. No need for finesse, just chum it out. May I throw in a murder that occurred during the trip... and center the story around finding the murderer? - Make it like a whodunnit? - Yes. Would our readers want that? Well... Well, I guess it's fine to write what you like once in a while. You're a pretty good writer. I don't quite have the sense for what our readers want. I'm counting on you. Oh yes... I'm sorry for your loss. Here's the condolence money. - You don't have to... - Just take it. Who is it? Your father or your mother? My father passed away ten years ago. Oh yeah, that's right. That was... When the story about a vampire was... Right? Now I recalled it. "Vampire in Love" It's a light novel targeting young female readers. It's not going to sell if the author is man. So I used your name and photo for the author's profile. I used your maiden frame "Sasaki". The publisher has agreed to publish my next book under my own name... if this book sells. Really? I'm not sure things will go so smoothly. My mother was always at the patio with a bunk an her lap. Wanting to be by her side, I became an avid reader myself. My greatest wish was for Mother to read the books I wrote. She was my one constant reader. "Need to put more effort into delineating the morality play". Even now when she is gone... she remains my harshest critic. Mother... I am an unfilial son. And a second-rate writer. "The Serialist" "Kobayashi and Akaba's" According to the contract you signed with my dad... you should be paying me your monthly rent of 90,000 yen... while my dad is away in the States. I know. You're three months behind on your rent. I know things have been tough for you, but I can't wait any longer. If I tell my dad, you will be out on the streets in a second. - I know. - No, you don't. I'll be getting paid for my manuscript tomorrow. "The Awakening of Love by Akaba Ippei" "His fingers teased and tantalized Aiko till she could bear it no more". "She finally gave in to him". "Oh, yes..." Could you please write something less sleazy? I set it! Go back to your dormitory and crack your books already. You have school tomorrow, don't you? What's this? You came in ninth for the nationwide mock exams? Oh, I almost forgot. This was in the mailbox. The publisher had this forwarded to me? The sender is Kurei Daigo from Tokyo Detention House. Kurei Daigo? "From: Kurei Daigo" "To: Akaba Ippei" Kurei Daigo, a self-proclaimed photographer. He murdered four women he recruited for his photoshoots. The women had their photos taken before they were killed in their own house. Kurei decapitated his victims and placed ﬂu wars around their bodies. He sent photos of his victims in life and in death to the police... provoking a furore. He was dubbed 'The Serial Photo Killer"... and gained international infamy. After his arrest, he repeatedly changed his statement... in bid to misdirect the investigation. In spite of his attempts, he was sentenced tn death in 2010. The heads of his victims were never found. I'm Kurei Daigo, a death-row inmate. Not once have I breathed a word of the truth since my arrest. Neither during the interrogations, nor during my trial. I want you to hear my story. Hear me out and write my memoir. I want to come clean about what really happened to those women. And the real reason why I did it. It would be an honor if I can have a meeting with you... at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely, Kurei Daigo. He sure is frightfully polite. Is this letter really from him? The memoir of a serial killer. That sounds like a bestseller, Ippei. I haven't decided if I'm going to see him. Besides, I don't even know if it's really from him. - Maybe it's just a prank. - Don't be such a coward. This is exactly why your fiancée left you. If I were you, I'd definitely pay him a visit. Even if this tums out to be a prank, this could be a lucky break for you. But I have a deadline to meet... Deadline for what? Another piece of sleazy erotica, I bet. Don't you want to be a truly great novelist? Erm... Is that letter really from Kurei Daigo? We have one condition. Do not publish a single thing he said while he is still alive. What? You may publish whatever you like... after his death sentence has been carried out. That's all. So... this letter really is from him? There's one thing I don't understand. Publishers have been knocking down our door trying to get a one-on-one with him. He has turned them all down. Why did he choose you? Well, it doesn't matter. I believe that he is innocent. I will get his death sentence revoked. Too bad for you. You may get to write his memoir, but you'll never get to publish it. Doesn't Miss Maeda remind you of a witch? Everyone's scared of her. She passed the National Bar Exam in her fifties. Sometimes, I wonder if she's not quite right in the head. Or maybe she's just too smart. Passing the National Bar Exam in her fifties? Sounds like she knows black magic all right. Right? Erm... Does she really think Kurei is innocent? She's a beautiful woman. And she passed the bar exam in her fifties. She was getting quite a lot of attention even before she took this case. The media accused her of taking on this case as a publicity stunt. This may sound strange, but Miss Maeda is so convinced of his innocence... that I can't help but think maybe, he really Is innocent. But Kurei... All we know for sure is that he photographed those dead bodies. The hair found on the victims matched his DNA. That was why the police, the prosecution, and the jury thought he was guilty. "Visitor number sixteen, please come to the tenth floor". I'll wait here for you. Be careful. "Vampire in Love" Sorry- This book... Oh, this is one of my favorite books. I've read it so many times that it's all worn and tattered. Is something the matter? Thank you for coming. I'm Akaba. Akaba Ippei. - Am I how you imagined me to be? - What? I said, am I how you imagined me to be? Yeah... Mr. Akaba. You're exactly how I imagined you to be. An ineffectual man whose only strength lies in being diligent. But seeing how you have no qualms meeting a heinous killer like me... it seems you really want to be a bestselling writer, don't you? I have a question for you. Just one? WhY The? "Aiko spread her porcelain-white legs open provocatively". "An involuntary moan escaped her lips as she giddily recalled..." "how she was grabbed by her hair..." "and forced to watch herself being humiliated and defiled in the mirror". I love the way you write. I'm your fan. Well... - About writing your memoir... - Nothing's confirmed yet. You want to write this tell-all, you have to do one thing for me. What? Ever since my arrest... I've been getting a lot of it. Fan letters. I have quite a devout following out there. Thanks to the media, I'm famous. I get flooded by letters from my fans. People who want to do what I did. People begging me to many them. People who wish to satisfy my every desire. Isn't life ironic? I'm finally popular with women, and I'm behind bars. What is it that you want me to do? I want you... to write an erotic novel just for me. I want you to write a love story of me and my devotees. That is the condition? I will never get to touch or photograph another woman. This is all I have left. I've already picked out three devotees. Please write a story about each of them for me. Let me think about it. I'm very sure you will take this deal. He's here. What were you thinking? How could you just do what that beast said? What? We are the bereaved. Kurei killed my wife. I'm Mishima. They are Mr. and Mrs. Harashima, and Mr. Ikita. Their daughters were killed. That's Miss Hasegawa. Her older sister was killed. Please spare a thought for us. Why would you dig at our old scars? Please... hear me out. I have only just met Kurei. - I haven't decided if I would... - Please make your decision now. We long for his execution. Can you understand what we're going through? Speaking as the victims' families... we don't wish to see this book published. I understand how you feel. I would like some time... to think over his offer carefully. Remember what you just said. Please write his memoir. My older sister was a bubbly and intelligent girl. Everybody loved her. My parents were proud of her. Her death was so devastating for my mother that she committed suicide. My father had a mental breakdown and is now institutionalized. Kurei destroyed my family. Even so, I want to know what happened to my sister. Knowing the details might just make it all the harder on you. But this may be the one chance to find out where Kurei hid my sister's head. I really wish to give my sister a proper burial. Can you understand that? Please write his memoir. I'm begging you. So, what are you going to do? What's holding you back? Think about it. If this book becomes a hit... it might even be made into a movie or a serial drama. You will become an A-list writer. You will have an assistant and even a manager. It's your dream to be a successful writer, isn't it? You have to grab this chance! Hey, where are you going? Out. Take this. Don't always drink cheap liquor. Find a nice bar and think this through carefully. Take it. Be wary of him. That dude is real manipulative. - I totally agree... - He's right. I can't accept money from a high school student. It has been a while, Mr. Konno. Please come this way. What a surprise! How many years has it been? Six years. Let me make the introductions. This is Akaba Ippei. Hello. Is he an ex-boyfriend? I'm her husband, Konno. - He is... - I know him. Mr. Konno, I've read several of your books. - It's an honor to meet you. - Don't say that. Well, they are waiting for me. Please excuse me. Please come this way. - Hello, I'm here. - What a surprised. I didn't know you're married to such a famous writer. What are you doing now? Well... You're still at your old job? Would you be here for long? - I can introduce you to them. - No, it's fine. I'll be writing Kurei Daigo's memoir. Kurei Daigo? That death-row killer? That's amazing! How did you get him to agree to it? Have you already met him? We had a brief chat. I took Kurei's deal without thinking twice. Just as Kurei predicted. I paid a visit to the first devotee. Chino Yuka, thirty years old. A bank employee. In her letters to Kurei... she vowed her undying love and pledged total loyalty to Kurei. I'm divorced. He saved me from loneliness. He touched my innermost desires. His words to me are like a gift from the heavens. Even so... it's not possible for you to ever be with Kurei. I'm not asking for him to be my husband. I don't even need his physical presence. Physical presence? All I have to do is close my eyes... and I can feel him. He can feel me too. I'm fine with it remaining a fantasy. I've been intimate with Kurei in my mind time and again. Mr. Akaba, do you prefer the flesh to the spirit? May I tell you my darkest fantasies? This is a pretty good story. There's nothing she wants more than for me to kill her. Your descriptions are a bit too straightforward though. Let me see... it reads more like an essay than a novel. I wanted it to sound realistic. It's essential to build the tension and keep it going. I see. - May I ask you a question? - You may not. I found an article saying... you were abandoned by your mother as a child. Don't ask me this kind of questions! Well... okay. Well, happy hour's over. I did strike a deal with you, fire away. I'm sorry. It's just that our meeting time is limited. The article says you were abandoned by your mother when you were five. I wasn't abandoned. We were separated by the police. Was it because of your mother's occupation? Occupation? You mean what she did for money? Yes, she was a hooker. Long story short... Some guy slept with my mother, got her pregnant, and she gave birth to me. Then he ditched her for another woman, leaving her with a huge debt. So my mother sold herself for living. That's all. What's wrong? Another article says you hated your mother for abandoning you. That's why you killed and decapitated those women. What a cheap story. No one knows the truth except for me. But I can tell you this... my mother was beautiful. Was your mother beautiful? Yes. Same as my mother. How unfortunate. We were always on the move to escape our debtors. Don't you just hate the winter sea? I spent most of my childhood shivering by the beach... staring at the winter sea and waiting for my mom. Mom sold herself to the truckers that drove by. I want more. But no matter where we were... mother made sure we had breakfast together every morning. Daigo! - Stop there! Wait! - Leave her alone! - Daigo! - Stop resisting arrest. Daigo... Daigo... Stop it! Let go of me! Mom...! Stop it! Let go of me! Mom...! You loved your mother dearly, didn't you? Did you ever see her again after that? No, I never saw her again. She died shortly after. How about your mother? - She passed away recently... - It's about time. "She sold herself as we traveled from place to place". "We always had breakfast together". "Don't you just hate the winter sea?" Please answer the door quickly. I'm Machida from the police. What is this about? I'm here about Kurei's memoir. Please don't write it, okay? Who are you to come to my house and tell me what to do? Spare a thought for the bereaved. Moreover, the truth has already been uncovered. I'm only doing my job as a writer. Trying to convince us... with your professional ethics as a writer of cheap erotica? I doubt the bereaved will be convinced. That's very rude of you. Besides, not all of the bereaved are against publishing the memoir. You mean Hasegawa Chinatsu? She's not what you think. Are you referring to her job? So you know she works at a hostess bar? She didn't tell me. But I could tell from how she dresses and the way she treats waiting staff. She works at an exclusive club where important figures visit. There are many rumors about her. Be careful of that woman. Not only are you telling me not to write the memoir... you're also telling me who I can associate with? Tm the man who arrested Kurei {an years ago. Mark my words. When you get tangled up with Kurei... it changes everything around you. "Kaburagi's" The second devotee is nineteen-year-old Kaburagi Juri. She was a victim of school bullying. Now she locks herself in her room all day. Coming from a fatherless family... her mother seems to be out at work during the day. I was invited into her room. My dream... is to be a killer. Do you understand? I have to be with him. My dream is to go on a killing spree with him. That would be awesome! Wait... Most people dream of killing someone but don't have the guts to do it. Man, just the thought of doing it gets me so high. Don't you think so? I want to have wild, animal sex with him. "And she smiled. The smile of a bodhisattva who has attained enlightenment". "One Way Ticket" This story is good. These girls who worship killing like they worship fashion trends. All you have to do is feed them sweet nothings... and they'll cling on to you like the happiest girl on earth. Have you ever considered becoming a writer yourself? A writer? Never. I love to talk, but I have no desire to write them down. You know... readers and writers are of two different realms. Readers can never dive into books and meet the author. And that's why it is such an honor for me to be able to talk to you personally. Who do you hate the most? Who do I hate? Myself, perhaps. What a self-centered man. No wonder you're stuck in life. Then who do you hate the most? Kudo Mieko. Your foster parents? She was always whaling on me. With a shovel, no less. What a bad kid! That frickin' old shrew. Swinging that shovel like there's no tomorrow. She's wrong if she thinks she can live out her life... glued to the TV in that filthy old shack. - But she did raise you... - She did it for the money! They received financial aid for fostering me. They splurged all that money on themselves... while I was never given a proper meal. That's why I would sneak out of their house with the camera. Of course I didn't have any film. All I did was peek through the viewfinder... and hit the shutter in my mind. The most important thing in photography... is to wait patiently until your target appears. When the wind stops blowing and time stops flowing... it's time to hit the shutter. That's howl started taking pictures. I would like to see those pictures. The objects that caught your fancy as a boy. I didn't know what art was back then. It takes time to build a reputation as an artist. Are you afraid of death? Well... YES, I am. I'm not afraid of death. Because my art will live on in the minds of people forever. That's the case for your work, too. Your books will live on forever in the hearts of those that have been touched by it. You never know. Although It does sound unlikely. "An Accomplice of Love" The third devotee is twenty-four year-old Dojima Sara. She is a porn star. Mr. Kurei has given me orders to give myself to you. I'm very sure you will take this deal. Excuse me. May we continue our interview? I'm coming in. Miss Dojima? A woman has been killed. Yes, it's murder! Mr. Akaba, was it you who called the police? You shouldn't have left. We need to ask you some questions. Mr. Machida... there's another dead woman here. What? Juri? I think she's in her room. - Excuse me. - Wait! Wait a minute... Juri? I'm coming in! Dam it! "Special Investigation On The Headless Bodies Case" I didn't kill them! Please calm down, Mr. Akaba. Since Kurei is safely behind bars... the only person who is related to all three victims is you. It is only natural for us to seek your assistance in this investigation. You killed them for your novel, didn't you? Just how many times do I have to repeat myself? Did you sleep with those women? What? We will be collecting a DNA sample from you. If you've had any sexual contact with the victims, we will find out. I didn't do it. Why would Kurei choose a second-rate writer like you to write his memoir? Were you Kurei's accomplice twelve years ago? This is too much! Oh come on, you have neither the motive nor the guts to kill those women. How can you be so calm? Quick, write down the details of the police interview before you forget. I haven't slept a wink since yesterday. Why didn't you choose to spend the night in the detention house? It would be great fodder for your book. - Fodder? - That's right. If Kurei's memoir becomes a bestseller... you can write another book about your experience writing his memoir. "Obscure Writer, Murder Suspect". Or maybe "Second-Rate Novelist Under Suspicion"? I'm going to bed. "Three headless female bodies have surfaced thus far..." Ouch! "Could this be the work of the Serial Photo Killer..." "who first made appearance twelve years ago?" "I'm going to interview Kurei's defense attorney, Maeda Reiko..." "who has always insisted that Kurei is innocent". Miss Maeda, are you going to confront the police? "Has there been new circumstantial evidence?" "Miss Maeda...?" What's so funny? Every event that happens in life is essential and inevitable. Therefore there is no point in being sad or depressed about things. So. Where's my third story? Did you forget to bring it? Hand it over. Dojima Sara's story. There's no way I could write her story. Then I have nothing to say to you today. A deal is a deal. You are not the murderer. The only explanation for the three new murders... is that the real killer is still out there and back on another killing spree. You are trying to live as the murderer. But that's totally useless. But... Why at this late date? There's a rumor saying Kurei is about to be executed. Perhaps the real killer found out that Kurei is planning on releasing a memoir. The Photo Killer is a psychopath. And like all psychopaths, he is extremely egocentric. The arrest of Kurei allowed the real killer to get away scot-free. But by releasing a memoir, Kurei would be claiming all the "credit"... for the real killer's deeds. And Kurei would, once again, usurp all the attention. The real killer couldn't stand for that. And he set me up because I'm writing Kurei's memoir. Who is the real killer? Who knows? Perhaps he did this to warn you off. "Warning"! That would make a good title for a novel. What are you talking about? Maybe it's too late to say this... but enough of this memoir nonsense. It's not enough. You don't want to write this memoir badly enough. What do you mean? Good writing is driven by compulsion. It's a pity, but you lack the drive and desire to write my memoir. I have many more devotees out there who send me fan mail. Please think about it. I said, stop this nonsense! Let me give you a sincere piece of advice. If you want to create art, you need to find that one holy place, you hear me? The holy place. It could be a desolate stretch of wasteland with no signs of life anywhere. But once a light pierces through the darkness... a holy cross would appear. Stay right there with your most sincere desire... and true art will be born! You hear me? - True art! - Quiet! That's enough already. Isn't it your dream to write detective novels? Start behaving like a private detective. Listen... a mystery author gets to set up the mystery before unraveling it... You'll be saving lives if you can unravel this case. And it will certainly make any novel you publish a bestseller. Such miracles would never happen to me. I'm Hasegawa. Hasegawa Chinatsu. Sony for the sudden visit. Is something the matter? I'm terrified at the thought that Kurei is not the perpetrator. And the real killer is still out there... I can't take it anymore! I understand. Calm down first. We'll figure out what to do next. What do you see? I see your desire. It's so beautiful. There is beauty in chaos. Is there any connection between Kurei's killings twelve years ago... and the three new deaths? We decide to investigate Kurei's past. This was where Kurei had his photoshoot with his victims. And he sent the very photos to the police. I see a car in the rearview mirror that has been behind us for a while. The silver car, right? It caught my attention too. Why don't you make a quick tum? Is it still following us? No, it went straight. Is this where Kurei spent his middle-school years? Excuse me? Hello? We're here to ask about Kurei Daigo. My husband is dead. No, it's pot about your husband. It's about Mr. Kurei. What a beautiful sunset. Where did you take that? This is not working. Ai! - Are you okay? - It hurts... Stand up slowly. You're bleeding! Let's go back to the car. I'm fine. No, the wound needs to be disinfected immediately. I doubt there is anything ahead. Let's go back. Easy... The factory boss's wife was Kurei's last victim. Kurei worked part-time here once. "Mishima Factory" See you tomorrow. Why are you here? Mr. Mishima... You're one of the bereaved. What are you doing, going around with that man? What were you thinking? As one of the bereaved, you ought to know better, don't you? Mr. Mishima... I'll say this again. Stop writing Kurei's memoir. His book will only intrude and mess up our lives. It will affect all of us badly. Do you think it's right to do that? Please stop writing it. And get out of my sight. Mr. Mishima was the one who asked Kurei to take pictures of his wife. The person he blames most is probably himself. - You lost your sister...? - Yes. You visited Juri once, didn't you? Can you tell me why Juri was so obsessed with a man like Kurei? I don't know. I only had a brief chat with her. But there's one thing I could tell. Juri was a good girl. Thank you. You wish to have a look around her room, right? Please go ahead. I haven't been able to bring myself to set foot in her room. The police took almost everything. She must be shocked that her daughter was a Kurei fan. I found her letters in the family shrine. I found it after she passed away. But I didn't want the police to misunderstand Juri... so I didn't give these to them. These are from Kurei? My daughter... Juri was not a good girl. She locked herself in her room for three years. She was always angry. But I had no idea what she was mad about. I thought... perhaps you would understand my daughter. That's why I want to give these letters to you. I couldn't understand her. I loved her with all my heart and raised her to the best of my efforts. She was... my most cherished daughter. It's all right... I want to... I want to... kill the man who did this to her! Chino Yuka's house is at the end of the road. Are you all right? I'm sorry, but I think I'd rather wait in the car. Let's just go home for today. No, we're already all the way here. You should go ahead. - Let's take shelter at my place. - Okay. "Hasegawa-s" I moved out right after I graduated from the high school. I didn't get along with my sister. Everyone was always comparing me to her cheerful, likeable self. I hated it. I shut her out of my life... back when she was alive. I didn't even want to think about her. But now, she talks to me everyday. "Why are you the one who lived?" "Why do you get to live, but not me?" "Why should I be the one killed?" "You're nothing. You should be the one who died!" She keeps talking to me... every single day...! Ippei! Good morning. What's the matter? You suck at reading people. That woman is weird. I can feel it. Be careful of her. Of her? My instincts are never wrong. Do you need my help? No. Do you have any idea who the shooter might be? Not at all. There were no witnesses. And you didn't have a scratch on you. What does that mean? Are you implying I made it all up? Stop playing the innocent. You took these pictures, didn't you? Wasn't Hasegawa Chinatsu with you at the time of the shooting? Where isn't she here? I was the only one who got shot at. I didn't think you would need her to be here too. Can you tell Chinatsu that I would like to see her here? "Yours, Hasegawa Chinatsu" Dam it... "To Kaburagi Juri" "Visitation" Kurei, you have a visitor. Hey! I don't want to. Kurei! I don't want to. It has been a while. We need to talk. My, you look stem. I'm getting all nervous. It's about your memoir. You never intended to publish a memoir, isn't it? It's all part of your plan to get out of jail. Am I right? I can't hear you. Why did you pick me when you could have very well written the memoir yourself? You just wanted to use me, didn't you? I read your letters to Kaburagi Juri. You're a much better writer than I could ever be. You have such a way with words... it's no wonder those women fell for everything you said. Be honest, you don't think much of my writing, do you? You used such beautiful words to get me to see you... plied me with flattery and convinced me to take the deal. I bet you were laughing at me all the while! Calm down, will you? In here, I've got nothing but plenty of time o read a wide range of books. I merely regurgitated whatever I could remember from the books in those letters. You think too little of yourself, Mr. Akaba. It's you who thinks so little of your writing. Have you ever had the one thing you never stopped wishing for... appear before you? I have. Something so beautiful and fragile, right before your eyes. I was so mesmerized, my body started trembling uncontrollably. I felt like I was about to faint. If only time would stop right now... yet I didn't want it to stop. I cannot faint right now. I've found my holy place. Listen. I can create moments so beautiful... it is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. I will hit the shutter and preserve the beauty forever. I will freeze my work in its perfection. That way, I will always tremble before its beauty. You hear that? Listen up now. If you really want to be a topnotch writer... you have to write about the real me. Who I really am. Who I really am! The real me! Who I really am! That's what you should write about. Please don't stop. I've chosen another devotee for you. She's a strange one. I killed her sister, but she sends me letter after letter. Hasegawa Chinatsu. You've decided not to write the memoir? Why? It's none of your business. No, don't do this! If you give up now, you will be back at square one. How are you going to pay for your rent? - I will pay up. - How? Well... I'll get a part-time job or something. Pick it up. I don't want to have anything more to do with the case. Are you giving up because of Chinatsu? No. I refuse to let Kurei have his way anymore. Ippei, don't you have any guts? You're pathetic! You're just a kid. What do you know? - Who are you to judge... - Forget it! I get it. This is just the kind of guy you are. - I'm so disappointed! - Shut up! Stop poking your nose into my affairs! Idiot! Don't you just hate the winter sea? My mother was beautiful. Was your mother beautiful? If you want to create art, you need to find that one holy place. The holy place. You have to write about the real me. It's not enough. You don't want to write this memoir badly enough. Have you seen the news? No, I'm not here because of that. What happened? You will find out soon enough. Miss Maeda hasn't slept for days. Be careful. Welcome back. I apologize for calling you here on such short notice. It's okay. The Supreme Court may accept my appeal for retrial. Which means it's very likely Kurei's case will go to court again. I just want to let you know that the memoir you're writing... cannot be published if that's the case. I see. Moreover, the victims' families have sent me a protest letter. You have been carrying out some investigation oi your own'!? I won't be writing Kurei's memoir. And I won't visit him anymore. A wise decision. It's one good news after another today. I came to tell you that. And also, whether or not anything can be published... I will continue to write about him. I want to know more about Kurei. I want to understand him. I'm feeling rather confused right now, but this is what I want to do. What does he see? How does he feel? What is it that he hates? And what does he love? What was going through his head all this while? I see. Then go ahead. She's wrong if she thinks she can live out her life... glued to the TV in that filthy old shack. How does Kurei know how his foster mother is doing right now? Help... anyone! Ippei? I'm sorry about yesterday. I'm in your room now. I told you not to come by my house until this matter blows over. I want to apologize to you. When will you be back? Who's there? Ai? Hello...? Ai! Ippei...! Bloody hell... Ai! Ouch...! Chinatsu... She is the killer... She's Kurei's mother. Did you kill my sister? Where is it? Where did you hide her head? I fed it to the pigs! Don't shoot. Don't! Police! Freeze! Mr. Machida. Where's Chinatsu? We let her go after we took her statement. As for your niece, Kobayashi Ai... she only suffered minor wounds. I've contacted her parents in the States. I have good news and bad news. Please tell me the good news first. Maeda Reiko confessed to killing the three Kurei devotees. We've recovered the murder weapon as well as the decapitated heads from her home. What's the bad news then? Those weren't the only murders she confessed to. She confessed to the Photo Killer killings from twelve years ago too. No way... I saw through those models immediately. They wanted to seduce my son with their filthy bodies. They wanted to steal my lovely boy from me! She followed the women back to their houses after Kurei's photoshoot... and killed them there. She sent those photos to the police because she hates us. But her son ended up being wrongfully arrested for her deeds. In order to save her son, she studied hard to become an attorney. She even changed her identity. Her confession tallies with all of our evidence. What a woman. What she did is beyond anyone's imagination. How did you know she's Kurei's mother? Because of the photos. The photos hanging on the walls of her office. I realized those photos were taken... around the hill behind Kurei's foster parents' home. I still believe Kurei is behind those killings twelve years ago. But to be honest... I've had a few moments of doubt about it. Are you sure it's fine for me to read these files? I'm going out for a break. What you do with these files meanwhile is none of my business. This is Hasegawa Koharu. The photos of the decapitated bodies are in here. Do you want to see it? "Housewife, Mishima Nobuko. Aged thirty-eight" Where is Mrs. Mishima's photo? We arrested Kurei soon after she was killed. He hadn't had time to send us her photos. We searched Kurei's house. But we didn't find Mrs. Mishima's photos, only unused film. "Inventory of Seized Items" "6. Camera 7. Camera film" Maeda Reiko isn't the shooter who assaulted you... near Chino Yuka's place and in the hills. The rifling pattern on the bullets we retrieved doesn't match that of her gun. Moreover, Maeda Reiko was in court... appealing for a retrial at the time of the shooting. Call me when you're ready to go. I will send you home, just to be safe. Okay? Goodbye. Megumi? Mr. Akaba. Were you brought in for questioning too? Yes. It was exhausting. They wanted to know every single detail about Miss Maeda's life. This must come as quite a shock. I don't think I can ever trust anyone again. I guess you can't just blindly believe everything you see. I suppose not. You're right! Excuse me, and thank you. Why are you back here, Mr. Akaba? Did something strike you? You can't just blindly believe everything you see. What are you talking about? Were any drugs detected in those headless bodies? Not at all. Something struck me as odd when I first saw these photos just now. Their pupils are dilated in every photo. You're right. We did check with a professional photographer about this. He said that happens when the camera flash is used. Yes, that's the case when the standard positive film is used. But... the only type of camera film the police found at Kurei's house... were tungsten film. What? What does that mean? Tungsten film is normally used for night shots. You don't use the camera flash with this kind of film. The pupils of Kurei's photo subjects shouldn't be dilated. These portrait shots were not taken before the victims were killed... but after! Wait a minute. So you're saying the victims were killed... photographed and then decapitated at home? That doesn't make sense. If I'm not wrong... these bodies are actually finely-made dolls. Probably using silicon or something similar. Look. All three victims were clothed from neck to toe in the photos. Kurei brought their heads home... fixed them onto the dolls, and took these portrait shots. Why would he do this? I don't know... Good job realizing that the bodies were fake. You look more confident now. - Your mother is still alive... - What do you know about us? Why did you kill those women? Do you know what a beautiful sight a woman who is bleeding makes? I was reunited with my mother after I graduated from middle school. She investigated my foster parents to track me down... and she seduced my foster father. Like countless times before... my mother used her body to dupe him for money. She was still so beautiful. But one day... I went up the hills with my empty camera like any other day. I heard my mother screaming... and my foster father shouting. You stupid woman! I rushed towards where the shouts were coming from... and found my mother... bleeding under a tree. I don't remember why... but I went up to her and laid in her arms. Her blood was all over me. But she held me close nonetheless. That night, we embarked on another journey, just the two of us. I left my holy place. We slept in the car, and traveled across Japan. The first time I killed a woman was when I was twenty. My mother welcomed me back... with a big smile on her face. I've always been driven by the compulsion... to seek out beauty. To etemalize it in art. That's why I came to Tokyo. I can have my pick of women in Tokyo. All I need to do is ask for models, and they come flocking to me. You mean those women you killed twelve years ago? They were so beautiful. I enjoyed every moment of it. Oh, the pleasure. People are dead because of you. "They were so beautiful"? Is that your reason for killing them? Yes. You should seek beauty like I do. Come up with works like mine. Beauty? Actually... the one person you really wish to kill, decapitate and take pictures of... is your mother, isn't it? You wanted to kill your mother. You love your mother with all your heart. And you hate her just as much. But still, you love her. You killed those women... because you wanted to be one with your mother. Through sharing the experience of murder with your mother... and the spilling of blood... you are united with your mother, creating beauty and art. Not bad. There is hope for you as a topnotch writer, after all. But all you really are is a little boy... who would do anything unquestioningly for his mother to stay by his side! You know nothing. You are ignorant of the world! You have no idea what art is. You don't know a thing about beauty! There is nothing in your photos. You thought you captured beauty, but you're just deluding yourself! Shut up! You don't understand my art. You don't know what real art is! You're nothing but a second-rate writer. - Kneel down before me! - I'd rather be second-rate... then to be like you! Second-rate or not, this is who I am. At least I am honest about it! - Kneel down! - This is who I am! Hello, Mr. Machida? I think I know where the heads are. "There are signs of digging here. We will focus on this spot for now". "Roger that". We found it! They found it! "15:02, a skull has been found". - And photos too. - "I repeat". "15:02, a skull has been found". Ikita Mitio, Harashima Atsusa... and Hasegawa Koharu. I don't see Mrs. Mishima's skull. Is this all? That's weird. If Kurei killed all four women... why would he bury Mrs. Mishima's head somewhere else? There is more to this case. Mr. Mishima! Kurei didn't send your wife's photos to the police. And that's because... he didn't kill your wife. You expanded your factory after your wife's death, didn't you? I'm guessing you did it using her insurance payout. I need to search your car. - Stop it! - That bloody woman! Why shouldn't I kill her? She cheated on me... and she had never once made me a proper dinner! Yes, I did it! I killed that slut! Grab him! - She deserved it! She was a filthy slut! - Don't move...! That filthy slut. I had no idea these are Kurei's pictures. I worked with her every day, but I never knew her true character. I have one thing to tell you. I'm sorry... but I already have a boyfriend. No, it's not that. You know the book you like so much? "Vampire in Love". Actually, I wrote that book. What are you talking about? The author of that book is a woman. Someone called Sasaki Ikuko. The publisher said this book would sell better if the author were a female. I used my mother's maiden name and her old photo. I see. I totally fell for it. I'm sorry. - Mr. Akaba. - Yes? I would love to read the sequel to "Vampire in Love". Please consider writing it. Make it more thrilling than the first book. Maeda Reiko is dead. What? She hanged herself. I wonder how her death will affect Kurei? I'm washing my hands off this case. Thank you for all your help. It's nothing. Take care. Ai! Are you better now? Sony for making you worry. Look, I'm okay now. Don't worry. I'll be moving to the States to join my dad. I see. All right. So I guess this is it. No, not this. The rent you owe me. Oh, right. I'm kidding. Just wire it to New York. Bye. But... Ippei! I'm looking forward to your next book. Everyone has left me. I've never felt more alone. Kurei. It's time for the execution. "To: Akaba Ippei" To second-rate writer, Akaba Ippei. The wardens have agreed to send this letter to you after my execution. (Prayer chanting) I'm glad to have met you. I like your writing and I've enjoyed our conversations. I think highly of your work. If only you can learn to love your gift for writing. I will leave you with the words of German poet, Hermann Hesse. "All the books in the world will not bring you happiness". "But they will quietly lead you..." "back inside yourself". Thank you for walking with me to my death. Yours, Kurei Daigo. "Portrait of a Death-row Inmate" "I am a second-rate writer". "And that is a second-rate opening sentence". "I received a letter..." "Portrait of a Death-row Inmate by Akaba Ippei" "The true colors of Kurei Daigo" A book I once read said... "A child can never break away from his mother“. Kurei's story... could be anyone's story. "To the memory of my late friend".
