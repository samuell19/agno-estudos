[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Ooh. You took my hand, said that you understand. There's a song in my heart. There's a song in my heart. And you promised me your love eternally, said we'd never part. Melody, pretty as a summer day. Rhapsody, thinking 'bout the love we made. Look in my eyes and I'm hypnotized by the things that you do. Things that you do, yeah. Playing with me like your playing those keys. I'm the music in you. How was that? Oh, that was great. Let's just do it again from the first verse. OK. All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Ooh. You took my hand, said that you understand. There's a-- What happened? I don't know. Damn it. Did we blow another fuse? I don't know. Yeah. We have no power. Billy, would you go check and see, please? Yeah. Gonna have to flip it, honey. All right. No. I think they shut off the electricity. [GROANS] This was due three days ago. They turned off the power. Damn! Do you have any money in savings? No, it's been gone. I'm gonna have to borrow some money from somewhere and get the lights on, so we can work in here. Momentary setback. Yeah, but it's always a damn momentary setback. I know. But things are gonna get easier. You can't even listen to the tape. So I'll take it to work. I'll listen to it there, work on it, see if I come up with any new ideas. What? What you looking at? I'm looking at you. Well, since you're looking, why don't you employ that special skill of yours. Oh, well, you gotta be more specific. Which special talent? You know I'm quite talented. You know what I mean. Are you gonna make me beg? Please. Oh, OK. Oh. I don't want to go to work tonight. Don't go to work tonight. I love you. You know, it won't kill you to say it. I know. I know you love me. Why don't you say it? Because you know I do and I'd rather show it. Ah, I wanna hear it. But it's more fun to show. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh. [MOANING] Just send 'em to the bar. They can have a drink. Let me worry about it, OK? You understand me? I see you, Lenore, you're late. I know. Sorry, Mark. OK, don't just stand there. Let's go. Get to work. What's with these tables? Why aren't they set up? Come on. - Hey you. - Hey. You're late. I know. Guess what? What? Lights got turned off today. Are you serious? Yeah, not good. VICTORIA: Do you need to borrow some money? No, I'm fine. Are you sure? LENORE: Yeah. It's cool. Yeah. So how was last night? Oh my god, we had a ball. I had the greatest time. Excuse me, ladies, are we on a break? No, sir. So save the girl talk for later, and let's get back to work. I'll talk to you later, L. Come on. Move it. Enjoy. Hey, what you need? Let me have two vodkas and a white wine. Two vodkas and a white wine coming right up for you. Hey, you know who's singing tonight? Uh-huh. Ready for this? Scary Carey. BOTH: Oh, they're all gonna laugh at you. They're all gonna laugh at you. Not to worry, I came prepared. Ear plugs. Lucky me. Oh my god, you got a customer. And he's fine, L. And it looks like he got some money. Go get his number for me. For me, the number. All right, you tell him he gets ten points on the record. I don't care what he thinks he should get. Look, New World picked him up when no other label would, all right? He owes me. You tell him that. I want the contract on my desk in the morning. Good evening, sir. Good evening. Oh, please, allow me. Thank you. My pleasure. So what can I do for you tonight? What do you suggest? Well, you seem like a martini man to me, smooth and sweet. An apple martini maybe? Perfect. Would you like to start a tab? Sure. I will be right back with your drink, Mr. Randolph. What's up? Did you get his number? - OK. What? That guy-- Uh-huh. He's from New World, New World Records. Oh, OK. Dominik Randolph. This could be it. OK. I need an apple martini. Make it the best apple martini you have ever made, sweetheart. You got it, baby. Coming right up. Here you go, the best apple martini I have ever made. OK. Just for you. You ready? Go get him. You look good. - All right. - Calm down. - OK. - Bring it down. LENORE: Bringing it down. - Be cool. - I'm cool. - You calm? I'm calm. VICTORIA: Handle it. All right. VICTORIA: Go do your thing. Smooth. LENORE: All right. - Sexy, a little sexy. - All right. VICTORIA: Go handle your business, a little twist in your hip. Bring the number back. [MUSIC PLAYING] There you are. [LAUGHING] LENORE: Would you mind taking this? No problem. Really? Really? OK, can I get you anything else? No, I'm fine. Thank you. All right. All right. OK, cool. All right. VICTORIA: Great, did you get his number? No. Billy, guess what? You'll never believe-- Oh, where you been, L? I was starting to get worried. I picked up some extra hours at work. Look, I have something to tell you. Well, I got something to tell you. Let me go first, please. But-- L, it's very important I tell you this. Let me-- Sit down for one second. Let me go first. OK. I talked to Paul today. He said he'd give me my old job back at the studio. Why? You hate engineering. That's not the point. The point is you can't be the only one working. There's no more money in savings. I got to get a job. That's the next logical step. Billy? I think-- Look at that. What is this? It's an eviction notice. [LAUGHING] Well, I know everything looks bad, but guess what? You'll never believe who came in the bar last night. Who? Dominik Randolph from New World Music. Really? OK, what happened? I gave him the tape and he said he'd listen to it. And you believed him? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Billy Dixon? Yeah, this is he. Who is this? It's Dominik Randolph from New World Music. I met Lenore last night. Oh, hi. Hi, how are you doing? DOMINIK [ON PHONE]: Good, thank you. Billy, who is that? As a matter of fact, even better since I heard your tape. You're very talented. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you would come down to my office today about 1 o'clock. Uh, yes, sure. You did produce and arrange this all yourself? Yeah, I did. Yes. Perfect. OK, I'm gonna put you on with my assistant to give you directions. Looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Dixon. Thank you, sir. I look forward to meeting you, too, today. ASSISTANT [ON PHONE]: New World building, fourth floor. Thank you very much. Bye. Billy? Who was that? That was him. Who? Randolph? Yes. Oh my god, that was him. He wants to see us later. He wants to meet us later. What? - That was him! - Oh my god. Oh! Yeah! ASSISTANT: Right this way, please. DOMINIK: Well, listen, I always thought the deal was fair in the first place. But we'll take care of it. I'll take that for you, sir. OK. Will do. Will do. Great. All right, talk to you later. I'm sorry about that. LENORE: Hi, sir. Good to see you again. Good to see you. This is Billy. DOMINIK: Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Have a seat. BILLY: Thank you. Can I get you anything, coffee, water? Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you. OK, let me get down to business. I listened to your tape and I thought it was amazing. Now, was that done in a home studio? Yeah, we do all our work right at home. And you, I mean, your voice is fantastic. How long have you been singing? For as long as I can remember. Yeah, well, it shows. This is my dilemma, though. As much as I do love your sound, right now we're not looking for singers. As you know, we already have Victoria. But what I am looking for is a rapper. And I think that could be you. You have a great sound and you produce your own stuff. Me? Well, I mean, I just put that rhyme on the track just to give it some flavor. I mean, it's kind of a fluke. I'm not really an MC. But Lenore and I, we're a team. You know, we work together well. Listen, I listen to a lot of demos and very few rappers come off the way you do. Now, if you ask me, I think you have the talent to pull it off. So let me paint the broad strokes so you can get a better perspective. I'm willing to offer you a single production deal-- $50,000 up front, points on the back-- and depending on the success, a possible contract. $50,000? $50,000. $50,000 up front? Uh, that's a lot. Well, I mean, it's a lot less after taxes, but it is cash money. Billy? Excuse me, Mr. Randolph, do you mind if we have a moment to talk? Oh, sure, take all the time you need. What happened to industry rule 4,080? I know, but, damn, we're here right now. He's staring us in the face with $50,000. That's a lot of money. And I know if I do the work, I'll get the pay. All right, you know, Lenore, if you want us to walk out of here right now, I'm with you. I'll walk out of here right now. If you really want us to walk out of here right now, because we're a team. But I think we're like a couple of damn fools to pass up on this money right now as broke as we are. I just want to make sure. This is all so confusing. It's happening so fast. I just never thought that we would have to make-- We're not doing this together. Excuse me, I have an awful lot of meetings today. And Billy and I have an awful lot to talk about. Would you mind if I arrange transportation for you? That's all right. Got the car, thanks. Great. ASSISTANT: Yes, sir. So? I guess I'll see you later. Good seeing you again, Lenore. Nicole will show you out. Yeah, I should be back home sort of early. I don't think it will-- actually, it shouldn't take all that long, the meeting. Sure. Lenore, Lenore, this is really for both of us. It's for both of us. Congratulations. [SINGING] It takes pain to live in these days. Sign here. [SINGING] Good money change a man's ways. Living the life in the fast lane. Thank you. WOMEN: [SINGING] Trying to survive, living the life MAN: [RAPPING] Ain't this what you always wanted. Sign right there. MAN: [RAPPING] The limelight, jewels that shine, and dimes blowing your mind. Out living the life of a ghetto star. Money, sex, and fly cars make it. Don't let it make who you are. 'Cause things change in the fast lane. Don't let it go to your brain. You got to think long range. It take pain to gain in these days. Living the life, doing things, moving things. WOMEN: [SINGING] It takes pain to live in these days. Good money change a man's ways. Living the life in the fast lane. Trying to survive-- Like I said, solid gold. Yeah. All right? I want a big campaign behind it. WOMEN: [SINGING] Good money change a man's way. Living the life in the fast lane. Come on, partner. All right, man. Hold all calls. WOMEN: [SINGING] Why, why, why. L, you still up? So is this how it's gonna be? What? What are you talking about? Just gonna be off doing your own thing and I'm supposed to-- Wait, wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait. Now, I'm sorry, baby. You know that, don't you? You know as soon as I get my foot in the door, it's like you're gonna be right behind me guns blazing. OK? Right? As soon as things get started. And you know they're gonna give me everything. I'mma have a cell phone. I'mma have a pager, email. I'mma have like a alphanumeric retrieval system. I'mma have a fax line. I'mma have an assistant, a web site. It's gonna be like www dot-- ooh, billy, you better call Lenore before she kick yo ass-- dot com. Gimme a kiss. Gimme a kiss. - No. - Gimme a kiss right now. Gimme a kiss right now. - I'm mad at you. Stop it. Don't be. - I'm mad at you. - Cut it out. Stop. So what happened? Well, OK, I'm going to do this remix for Victoria. And they want me to rap on it. It's like they see me like I'm some kind of MC or something. It's kind of like-- it's actually kind of weird. But whatever, I'm producing the remix. Victoria? Yeah. She gonna be there? No, no, no, no. I doubt it. I doubt if I even meet her, you know? She's such a sort of big star. It's like I'll probably be in the studio, and then she'll probably be in the studio. We probably won't even see each other. It's like a studio thing, you know? So when are you gonna work on your own stuff? Oh, well, that depends. It really depends on how the single does. You know? Because if the single doesn't do well, I might not get an album deal. It'll do well. It'll do great. I know it will. I want my kiss. . I demand, I demand my kiss. I'm still mad at you. Gimme a kiss right now. Cut it out. Forget it. All right. No, come here. Don't do that. I'm still mad at you. Don't be mad. Give me another kiss. Kiss me a lot. Oh, give me a break. I'll talk to you later, bye. Billy, this is Victoria and her assistant Darren. I'm Billy, Billy Dixon. I love your stuff. It's very nice to meet you. Let's hear what you have so far. OK, all right. Wait, sorry. Hello? Billy, let me speak to you, man. Billy, Victoria can be, well, a little difficult. She might try and test you, but don't take it personal, OK? No, no, I won't take it personal. I know, you know, I know I can probably handle myself quite well, thank you. Well, I'm sure you can. But just in case, if you have any problems, don't hesitate to call me. OK. Do your job, OK? All right, good luck. Later. What? Take it easy. Mm. Um, so-- Let's hear what you have. OK. Um, excuse me, sorry. Uh, Steve, could you hook up the-- yeah. Let me hit it. Thank you. Here we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's all you have? Well, I didn't want to go too far. Dominik told me you like to have approval. Damn right. You don't have any hits? Platinum, gold? No, I don't have any platinum or gold. I mean, I work out of my home studio. I've written a lot of songs, you know. I'm a musician. I've worked hard. I mean-- So nothing, you have nothing that's been released? I'm sorry, I didn't know I was supposed to come in here with my resume. No, I didn't ask for your resume. But it lets me know what you can do. It lets you know what I can do? Can I ask you a question? Did you have any platinum hits, any gold records before you signed with New World? Exactly. So why don't you just tell me what you like, why don't you just tell me what you don't like, and we can get down to business. - Steve, man. - From the top? Yeah, from the top, man. Lemme listen to this. Here we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, hey, Lenore, are you OK? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sit down. Sit down. Are you all right? Oh, I'm fine. - What's wrong with you? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Nothing. Look, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get you a glass of water. - It's OK. - I'll be right back. I'm gonna get you some water. VICTORIA: [SINGING] Cotton candy sweet, oh-ho, my candy sweet. Every time we meet. Every time we meet. Your cotton candy sweet. Every time we meet. Every time we meet.

Yeah, I mean, I feel like I can handle it. Good, good. Dominik, can you book two suites at my favorite hotel so we can start first thing in the morning. DOMINIK: That's exactly what I was thinking.

Everybody, from the top, OK? One more time. No. No. Darren, get in here. - Oh, here we go. - What's she doing? Here we go. What's going on? I wonder how long this might take. MUSICIAN: Hey, is it OK if we have a cigarette break? I can't do this. What's going on? This is her, man. This is her. They're all like this. Are these people new? Excuse me, are you playing E flat? See, they convinced her she's a star and now she believes it. Look, just do me a favor, OK? When you blow up, man, when you get the limousines and the hit records and all that, just don't ever read anything they write about you, OK? Why? Because, man, you can't be that bad. But you know what, you can't be that good either. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, that's good advice, man. I'll remember that. I'll remember that. What do you wanna do? Let's take five, man.

No, no, no, what is your problem? Excuse me? Do you know, this is your job. Do you know how many people would kill to be where you are? Maybe you don't understand. I'm tired, which means we're through for the day. No, no, no, no, ain't nobody leaving here until I say they can leave here. We got 24 hours to do this damn remix that you wanted done in the first place. That means we gonna stay here until it's done if it take us until the show starts. Now, everybody, get up. Up!

Whew, isn't this better than that dark studio? Saying, man. Service, wow. Can't wait till I have me a phat crib, you know, two phat cars in the garage. Man, this is living. What did you buy with your advance? - I ain't buy nothing. - What? I treat myself with every album. Well, you got it like that, you know? You can do things like that. I can't really do nothing like that till I'm like where you are, you know? Mm-mm, no, you don't. I bought a Jaguar on my first album out. I didn't know if I was ever gonna have a successful single. You have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have. He didn't call? No. I think I'm losing him, Jasmine. Mm, uh-uh. He hasn't called. I haven't seen him in days. Oh, come on, El, he's working. Hey. . Hey, the lights are on. The bills are paid. Yeah, I know. But something's different. I feel like I don't matter. I mean, how do I compete? It's a whole new game. I don't fit with any of those people. And there's Victoria. Oh, stop it. Billy has never given you a reason to doubt him, never. I hear you, I do. And I know how you feel. OK, you know what? You need to go up to that hotel. You need to tell him that you're pregnant. And tell him that you love him. Oh, Lenora, it's just that things are changing right now, that's all. And he needs your support right now. Hm? OK. You're right. - I'm right? - Yeah. - OK? All right. [KNOCKING] Hey, hey. Hey. There's no hot water in my room, can you believe it? Can I use your shower? Uh, yes. OK. So are you coming tonight? Uh, yeah, I should be coming tonight. It depends on how long my meeting is with-- Oh. I have a meeting tonight with Dominik. It depends on how long the meeting goes. But, uh, yeah, I should come. Victoria, thank you so much for everything. I love it. Thank you. You can thank me later. OK. Uh, I'm just looking for the key. Uh-- [CLEARS THROAT] Because you gotta have the key. Here's the key. You know what, I'll put it over here because I know you-- And the showers should be hot. And you can give me the key later. I'll see you later, OK? It should be fine. So, uh-- uh-- all you gotta do is give me the key back. I guess I can get the key back from you later. OK. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry I'm late and all that. Whew. Ah, man. It's hot to death. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. I'm very glad you like it. I'm glad everybody likes it. And I know, Victoria, she worked really hard. I mean, everybody worked really hard. You worked hard. I've seen a lot of talent come through those doors, and I gotta admit, you could be one of the best. I'm prepared to offer you a contract. It's a deal. Ah, man. Yes! [MUSIC PLAYING] VICTORIA: [SINGING] I remember when we met. Staring at the same sunset. We had problems on our mind gonna be fine. No, that sweet won't go away. Getting stronger every day. Cotton candy sweet. Every time-- MAID: Best you no tell no one. I'll get in trouble. OK. VICTORIA: [SINGING] So cotton candy sweet. Every time we meet. Every time we meet. Sitting in the park or on the phone. Now I'll never feel alone. We only started out as friends. Now I wanna see you again. Billy? Sweetie? [GLASS SHATTERING] Wait. Let me explain. Son of a bitch. Wait. Damn, girl. You scared me. Very impressive. You're quite a little artist. I try. Wow. You like? Yeah. I brought you something. Ah, thank you. Thank you very much. But what are you doing here? Aren't you gonna be late? That can wait. I like to make an entrance. Actually, I came to bring you your key. Well, you know, you're really gonna make some kind of an entrance, you know. You finish your meeting with Dominik? Yeah, I did. Good, then we can go to the show. Oh, I was gonna take the music over there. No, no, no, no. Go with me. We'll have fun. OK. All right, that actually sounds like fun. Because I'm in the mood to celebrate. Because I just made a deal with New World. - What? - Yes. Yes. Oh, congratulations. Yeah, you know, the deal, we met, you know, like earlier and all. And how was your shower? Fine. Just fine. Come on, let's go. Come on. What are we doing here? It's just PR, baby. Just go along. [CHATTER] [COUGHS] Answer, answer, answer. [CHATTER] Hello? Jasmine? JASMINE [ON PHONE]: Lenore, are you OK? LENORE: Something's wrong. I think I'm losing the baby. JASMINE [ON PHONE]: Stay calm. I'll call Dr. Johnson. It'll be fine. Uh-huh? JASMINE [ON PHONE]: It'll be fine. Yeah? Victoria, Victoria, who's your friend? This is my new producer and new artist on my label. This is Dollar Bill. - You all right? - Mm-hm. I'm gonna take that dress to the cleaners. Don't worry, just throw it out. Throw. It away. All right. Thank you. Oh, I'm such a pain in the butt. I'm so sorry. Come on, I got you. Just gonna rest here for a minute, OK? I love you, Lenore. I love you, too. So I'm gonna be downstairs if you need anything. I'm fine. All right, baby girl. OK. Lenore, what are you doing out of bed? I can't stay in bed anymore and look at his crap. - Yeah, but what are you doing? - Packing. What? Billy's stuff. Would you like to help? This is what you want to do? Put the bag on. You got it. OK, so what now? I don't know. Well, El, you can keep erasing his messages, but eventually you're going to have to deal with him. I know. That's why I'm going to tell him it's over. You're sure about this, El? Billy is never going to accept that, not after everything you two have been through. No, he's the one who made his choice. Well, I still think you need to tell him about the baby. Why? No, I want this chapter of my life closed. I'm done. What? Lenore? Lenore? What are you doing here? What you look like asking me what I'm doing here? What the hell are you doing here? Lenore wants me here. Who put my keyboard down here like this? Billy, I want you to move out. It's over. Jasmine, would you excuse us? Sure. You want me to dump this on my way out? - I'll call you, all right? - Bye, baby. Bye. Wait a second, now. Lenore, I know I was buggin' out. I've been bugging out a lot lately. But I've been out of pocket. But, you know, I'm out here building for our future. Really? Now, how is this building for our future? What is this? Don't get me-- this is nothing. That's publicity. Come on, now, I'm working hard. I'm busting my ass. You know, Billy, you need to stop lying to yourself. This is not about me. It's about you. That whole thing, that whole deal with New World, for you. OK, when we were in the office, I told you right then and there, I don't have no problem walking out of here with you right now. That's the difference between you and me. I would have never taken the deal without you. Look, the only one benefiting here is you. Look around. I'm still a waitress. My life hasn't changed. What you want me to do? I want you to leave. Come here, don't say that. All right? We don't have to work it out like that. We can work it out better. You don't have to say stuff like that. Right? You know how I feel about you. How do you feel about me? You know how I feel about you. No, I want to know. How do you feel? Tell me. You know. Tell me. I want to hear. That's what I thought. Why don't you just leave? You just gonna put my stuff out here and you gonna tell me to leave, huh? You want me to leave? [DOORBELL RINGING] Damn. - Hi. - Hey. Come on in. Wow. I still can't believe you live in this big place by yourself. I don't. I live on the road. I'm hardly here. Oh, last time I was here, I really wanted to-- I want to play your-- this baby grand. This is amazing. Go ahead. It's beautiful. Play. Oh, wow. [PIANO PLAYING] You know, the first time I ever played it was on a baby grand just like this one. How long are you here? I don't know. Does it matter? No. You're beautiful. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Good morning. Good morning. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. So I was thinking, you should get some of your things and move in here. Oh, really? When you'd find time to think about that? When I opened the door and saw you standing there. Billy, I'm a big girl. I know what I want. I want you here. No strings, no rings. I can do that. Here's the deal, I don't want any drama. Drama, what are you talking about? If you're gonna be here, then you're all the way here, you understand? I'mma go get my things. OK. See you later. OK. [SINGING] You took my hand, said that you understand there's a song in my heart. BILLY: Absolute garbage! You act like you never touched a keyboard. Get up. Get up. Get up! [SINGING] And you promised me your love eternally. [MUTTERING RAP LYRICS] [SINGING] Said we'd never part. Melody, pretty as a summer day. [MUTTERING RAP LYRICS] [SINGING] Rhapsody, thinking 'bout the love we made. Melody, ooh, pretty as a summer day. Rhapsody. [SOBBING] [SINGING] Thinking 'bout the love we made. [APPLAUSE] Hey, break it up. You did great. I know, I know. Back to work. Lenore, you are one lousy waitress, at least now I know why. I tell you what, tomorrow night leave the uniform home, put on something nice. 10 o'clock, you get on the stage, you show the customers what you're really supposed to be doing. And try not to be late. CUSTOMER: All right, girls, You go ahead with your bad self. Billy, I love you. Lenore. What's the matter, can't sleep? No, I got a lot on my mind. Well, maybe if you lay off this, you can get something done. Don't tell me what I need to lay off of. Back off me with that. Who you think you talking to like this? You come in here all hours of the night. Ain't no telling what tramps you been out there whoring around with. And you still calling bitches' names in your sleep. You said no strings, no rings. You wanted me, now you got me. Now, stop trying to change me. You don't tell me what to do in my house. If you don't like you can just-- What? I can just what? I can just leave? - No, no. - I can leave? No. If I don't like it, you just gonna put me out? No. I don't mean it like that. No. I-- I got a lot on my mind, too. I just need you to be understanding. It's just that you're driving around in my truck, people know we're together. So? Image means everything. I mean, I know you don't know that much about image. And I'mma teach you. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. . Billy, what's the deal with these new tracks? Look, I know that the tracks are a little rough. - A little rough? - --because I need more time. Billy, they're so dark, it makes me want to slit my wrists. I need more time. Look, time is something that we don't have, all right? Come on, let's go. - Where we going? We're going up the hall. I got some people I want you to meet. Who? Your writers, that's who. From now on, every hour, every hour, you're gonna write songs with them. We're gonna pick the best 15, and we're gonna make this album. Creativity does not work that way. You cannot go putting creativity on a timeline. Look, you are on a timeline. Now, that track you did for Victoria is gonna drop soon. Now, with any luck, it'll will run awhile. But when it cools down, we're gonna need to drop your single right then to take advantage of the hype. Now, I know you're not used to working like this. You said you liked my sound, my sound. Yes, I like your sound. But stars are made, not born. I need a hit. Then you can call the shots. Now, come on, time is money. The kid is good, but, I mean, his head is not on straight. I need you to straighten him out, man. Because this is getting ridiculous. All right, now that we're all here, I'm gonna leave you alone to do your creative thing. But no one is to leave this room until we have a hit. Nah, kid, come on. You gotta let it flow. You know what I'm saying? I'm not feeling this. Yo, you ain't been feeling jack since you been here, man. What's the deal? This ain't me. I don't work this way. Yo, let me ask you a question, partner, how do you work? Because ever since you got here, all you've been doing is complaining. And you know what? We doing this for you, anyway. That's the point. I don't need y'all here to do this for me. I can do it myself. I'm outta here. I'm tired of these clowns taking credit for my hard work, man. Hell, I'm out of here, man. Yo, man, bring my car around. [SINGING] Rhapsody, thinking 'bout the love we made. [APPLAUSE] You were great. You were great. I'm proud of you. Now, get back to work. Jasmine. You were so good. And you look so pretty. Lenore Foxwood. Tony? Tony Spencer? Oh my god. How you doing? Great. I'm sorry, Tony, Jasmine. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I haven't seen you since high school. Mm-hm. So what are you doing, what's up? Well, I'm managing talent now. Really? In fact, I'm doing a cut on this soundtrack for this movie called "Night Falls." "Night Falls," you know, that's the movie I auditioned for, but I didn't get. Lenore, I'm gonna give you my home number. I want you to call me so we can talk about Rhapsody. OK. Hey, maybe we can have dinner and catch up on old times, all right? - Great. - It's great seeing you. - It's good to see you. All right. Your girl is crazy. We'll call you, Tony. Call me. He's fine. Call him. You need to quit hitting the juice, man. Don't tell me what I need to do! Don't tell me what I need to do! Why don't you tell them what they need to do? I think you already did. We in here eight hours. I know this. I'm here, too, remember? - Just queue up. Queue 'em up. Queue 'em up. Queue 'em up. - All right, guys. I'm gonna kick back the reverb a little bit in the cans. Let's do this. It's hot as hell in here. LENORE: [SINGING] Rhapsody, thinking 'bout the love we made. And cut. Props, can we get that taken care of. So listen, yo, do you see this? - What'd I tell you? - She is incredible. Incredible, bro. Thank you. Thank you. She's making it happen. She's putting it down. Let me go holler at her real quick. Do that. Do that. Hey, you like it? All right. Come here, girl. You are fantastic. Uh. It looks great. Thank you. For what? For all this. Girl, thank you. Listen, I made reservations for us at your favorite restaurant tonight. Excuse me, Tony. We're ready, Lenore. You set? - Uh-huh. - OK - All right. Let's do this. So I'll check you later, all right? I'll be right here waiting. OK, bye. Do your thing. Is she everything I told you about, bro? - Yes. - All right. Can we do this? Yo, roll playback. You've got an amazing way with women. Uh-huh. I think you had too many. I can't believe-- Oh, what time is it? I had so much fun tonight. So did I, baby. So did I. I just can't believe all this is happening to me. Don't be surprised. You deserve all of this. ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: Hey, we got something special for you, a BET world premiere. This young lady is being called the next Mariah Carey. Check out her video from the "Night Fall" soundtrack. [MUSIC PLAYING] No, what? What? [SINGING] Ooh, ooh. You took my hand, said that you understand. There's a song in my heart. There's a song in my heart. And you promised me your love eternally. Said we'd never part. She did it. Oh my god. [SINGING] Pretty as a summer day. Rhapsody, thinking 'bout the love we made. Hello, Billy, it's Dominik. Guess what I just saw? Your ex-girlfriend's video. And she's hot. Think you can get her to sing on a track? Goodbye, Dominik. Think about it. It's a good idea. Goodbye. Billy? Billy? Where have you been? I went out. Did you forget I was coming back tonight? Yep. I'm going back to the hotel. What? Victoria, listen, I think-- I don't give a damn what you think. You can't leave me. Don't do this. Don't do this? Yeah. What do you mean don't do this? How about, don't take care of you anymore, huh? How about, don't buy Billy any more clothes? How about, don't buy Billy anymore jewelry? Don't let Billy drive my-- Get out of my face with that. I just wanted to help you. I wanted us to be a team. Believe me, I don't-- I don't want to hurt you. Hurt me? You can't hurt me. I made you. Dollar Bill, I don't need you. You need me. Just get out of my house. So what are you waiting on? Get your stuff and get out of my house. Get out of my house! ASSISTANT: Bill, you can't go in there. He's busy. I'm-- I'm telling you, you can't go in. He's not gonna see you right now, Billy. You've gotta wait. - Get off me. Come on. If they wanna play hard, we can play hard. Billy! I mean, that's not even my concern. Excuse me. I need to talk to you. I'll call you back. What can I do for you, Billy? Well, I ain't gonna beat around the bush with you. I want out of this contract. Why? Somebody offer you a better deal? No, that's not it. I'm just not feeling this music anymore. So any money that I owe you, I'll pay you back. But I'm through. Have you been drinking? No, actually, actually I haven't been drinking. Actually, it's the first time I've been sober in months. So I'm tired of this business. I want out of it. You should've thought about that before you signed a two-album deal. Why? I've heard you all talking about dropping me anyway. You should be happy. Let me explain something to you. You signed a contract, which means I own you until I get those records. You're kind of like my bitch. And if you try and breach this contract, you will be my bitch for the rest of your life until you pay me back every nickel I invested in you. I understand you're having a rough time. I'll give you today off. But I will see you in the studio tomorrow. Now, get the hell outta here. Get ready, guys. Line up here. REPORTER 1: Hey, Rachel, over here. Over here. She's coming out in two minutes. Get a picture. [CHATTER] Billy. BILLY: Hey, congratulations. Hey, Billy. Hey. What a surprise. Yeah. How are you?

I could tell you from the door, you wanna know the whole little industry here ain't nothing but snakes and rats. When you talking about your family, that's supposed to always come first. See, I got a wifey at home, man. I completed my circle. It wasn't complete until I did. The whole point you gotta realize, if you in the projects and you throw cheese on the floor, what's gonna come out? Rats. Before you have money, you ain't seen none of that.

Then it never was real if you can't. We-- We slept together. All the last few years have just been for absolutely nothing. I didn't sleep with him, but nothing really happened. No, what happened?

She's off pursuing her career. Well, listen, Jasmine, I need to know exactly where she is right now. I have something very important to tell her. Why should I tell you anything, Billy? After all you put that girl through, why should I tell you a thing? Because I love her. You love her? Yes, I love her. [GROANS] Hey. Hey. You had me nervous there for a minute. Let me get your bag.
