You "French" ribs to make a rack of lamb. How much will that cost ? And who'd order it ? This isn't a four-star restaurant ! "Frenching" ribs ! Cut it out ! Give me five kilos of neck. You'll make tagine. But we could change things up I found this one recipe. Quit it with that Reblochon ! You'll make a tagine, and we'll all be happy. Elias ! Stop moping ! You never let me make good food ! Elias, don't you start with that nonsense ! And drop the Arabic ! I've told you before. Or else your French'll never get better. Here ! I got you this at the market.

Brown and then cover them with three ounces of poultry stock. Season and boil them. And add the lobster and chestnuts, a clove of garlic, a diced truffle, the coral butter... Hello Elias, how's it going ? - The chicken you ordered. - He's all scrawny ! - How much ? - 40 dirhams. You trying to kill me ? - Okay, 30. - That's more like it ! I've had with that one ! Always yelling. - She's Lotfi's niece. - What a shitty village ! Her dad sent her here to learn about life. - Well, goodbye ! - See you. You think this is funny ? I have to make a call. Can I see your phone ? - I don't have one. - Even my grandma has one. And you use flint to light up ? No, I don't smoke. Don't I know you ? Elias, from the convenience store ? - Salma... Salma ! - I gotta make a call ! - What'd you do with the phone ? - It wasn't me ! What if your uncle needs it ? - He'll find me. - He doesn't want to. If he touches me again, I'll call the embassy ! Hey, wait up ! Wait ! I need to call my sister before she makes a big mistake. Right now. - Do you have a sister ? - No. A brother ? If you need family, you can have mine. - Where're you going ? - The store. I'll come along. The whole village's seen us together. My reputation's tainted ! I love not getting what I want right away. - He won't let me call. - Well, he's not crazy ! You realize we're cousins ? Our moms... Two cigarettes, please. ...have the same roots. We're family ! Make them Marlboros. - And a lighter. - Okay. - Put it on my tab. - Hello ? Khadija ? You hear me ? Can you hear me, Khadija ? Hello ? You know where I am ? Jurassic Park ! Dinosaurs everywhere ! All I do here is eat then sleep, eat then sleep, eat, sleep, eat, sleep... I get yelled at and then I eat and sleep more ! I'm calling you from the shop. It's the only one for 600 km. Don't forget your matches ! You realize how lucky I am ? He's right here ! The shopkeeper, of course ! Yeah, he lets me use the phone. What's he like ? He's all right. He's cute. Hot, even. Yeah, not bad. All the women in the family want to marry him ! But they're all, like, 80. So too bad ! Huh ? No, he doesn't know about love and loss... He has a heart of stone ! You hear me ? Yes... I miss you all ! It's horrible here. Kisses to all of you ! The answer's no in French and Arabic. - Hello ? - It's no. Got it ? It keeps cutting out ! This sucks. Fine, go ahead. It's on me. Make it quick. A genuine rotary phone. What's that ? Hello ? Khadija ? If you're thinking what I think you're thinking, don't do it. Put that on my uncle's tab, okay ? - Hello. - Hello, sir, madam. - Are you still serving ? - What would you like ? We noticed kefte tagine on the menu. I'm so sorry, we've run out. It was really busy today. - Lemon chicken ? - Neither. But we do have couscous with fresh beans. It's delicious. That sounds perfect. Two couscous then. Two couscous, it is ! Do you know Moktar's olive grove in Ras El Oued ? Moktar, no, but Ras El Oued, yes. - Where is it ? - Near Tahala road. Thank you, and welcome ! Well, did a pigeon shit in the couscous ? - That's Julien Blanc ! - Who ? - The chef from TV ! - Really ? He's better on TV. Hey, don't waste that bottle ! - But that's Julien ! - So ? You want me to go broke ? Not that ! That's what we sell to tourists. We can't serve them from your dog bowls ! I said no ! But Yous, this is important to me. All right. I'll wash them. Want some broth ? We'll head back via Fez. This isn't a zoo ! Step back. It'll freak him out if he sees you. Serving Julien Blanc couscous. It's shameful ! What do you think he was expecting here ? I have to make a dessert worthy of him ! Hurry ! They're almost done. Give me two minutes. I'm finishing the plating. - How was it ? - The bouillon's excellent. Dessert ? No, just a coffee and the check. I insist. It's on the house. He never makes such a fuss over us ! But this is the great chef from French TV ! All good ? That's lovely ! What is it ? Caramelized apple pastilla with pistachio cream. - Smells nice ! And this ? - White cardamom coffee. It needs a few more minutes to perfect the flavor. You know what, Elias ? You'll serve them. You deserve it. I'll take care of the white coffee. Clean yourself up. Get ready ! Go on ahead ! I'll catch up. ...swordfish tagine. We also said we needed a tuna tagine. That's for us ? - Yes. - No, thanks. It's far too much. - Do you want it ? - Sure. It looks tempting ! I made this dessert especially for you and Madame Blanc. You know who I am ? I watch your show. I never miss it. Don't just stand there ! Serve our guests. Please forgive him. He just started. And two white coffees to accompany your dessert. It was our little chef's idea. Back to the kitchen ! Interesting. So this is where you cook ? Yes. Who taught you to cook ? Mama... My grandmother did. And all your shows. Your grandma must be something ! Your dessert was perfect: balanced flavors, the right crisp, sweet apples that are still tart, smooth pistachio cream, orange blossom notes... great ! - What's your name ? - Elias. Well Elias, keep up the good work. - Could I look at your broth ? - Of course. I'd like to know what's in it. So... A clove-studded onion. Cilantro, right ? Caraway. - I'm just inspecting the broth. - By all means ! Ras el hanout spices, of course. There's one spice I can't identify. Yes, I know ! I know. It's not a spice. Actually I give up. They're fenugreek seeds. They keep the broth from being bitter. Then I filter it to keep just the fumet. A tip from my grandmother. What does fenugreek look like ? - Can I buy it ? - Just take some. We have lots. Can I ask you something ? Elias, if you're in Paris, come by my restaurant. I'll show you my kitchen. Thanks again ! There you go. You'll be a top chef ! You'll soon move to Paris to start a great restaurant on the Champs-Élysées ! Why're you egging him on ? You think it's easy to work in France ? There're already 3.5 million others looking for jobs ! And no one'll cook for us if he's in France ! Not as well, at least. Stop blathering and go get us coffee ! Salma ? What's going on ? Why're you crying ? Just leave me alone ! I'm sick of this rotten place. There's nothing to do. Plus that old jerk who won't get off my back... Stop. You know, it's different here. Yeah, I'd gotten that, thanks. Come on, I'll show you an amazing place. Is there such a thing here ? Come and cool off. Why were you praying ? Are you religious ? Not really. "Not really ?" I was praying for my brother. He died crossing to get to France. They never found his body. I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm really sorry. That's your brother's chain ? Yeah. It's all he left behind. We'd come here together and swim. He taught me how to dive from that rock. Grandma ? Come on, get up. Help me Can I get you something ? No, I'm fine. Messed up. Piece of shit oven ! Hey, Elias. - Smells great. What is it ? - I'm trying something out. But I screwed up. Can't you use a spoon ? - Delicious ! - It's all wrong. - What is it ? - Macaron but the oven messed it up. You're in a bad mood. Forget your cooking, let's go swim. - Come on ! - I have to wait for Youssef. Yeah. It's not a great macaron. But let's meet up after ? - All right ? - Sure. But not in two hours ! I'll be waiting. Know why my uncle was pissed ? I was tanning topless on the roof. But no one could see ! "God can !" Like He'd never seen tits before ! "You're surprised I call you a whore ?" So where in Paris do you live ? In a housing project. Not so glamorous. Glamorous ? What do you mean ? "Glamorous" would be... For example A half-clothed girl drying off after a swim in an amazing place. Now, that's glamorous ! The projects suck, so I hang at Les Halles. What's Les Halles ? A cool place that sells all the latest clothes. - Restaurants... - Really ? Yeah, there are restaurants. It's pretty wild ! Les Halles must be amazing. Yeah It's definitely not like the village ! - You know Julien Blanc ? - The chef from TV ? Yeah, he had lunch at Youssef's. - Why was he in that dump ? - I don't know. But he finished the couscous I served him. His wife was there, too. - And he said my dessert was perfect. - No kidding ! Imagine ! Julien Blanc thinks my dessert's perfect. He even congratulated me. - Youssef went crazy. - Awesome ! We'll go that way. It's better. Oh, I get it. You don't want to be seen with the village whore. It's just that if your uncle sees us, he'll "bust your head in..." Sorry, I'm a bit paranoid. Don't worry about it. How can I make you forgive me ? No ideas ? I'll let you keep thinking then. Come on ! - Where're you going ? - Home. Elias ! Just in time ! Can you help me straighten this ? What is that ? Come and take a look. See what he wrote. Bravo, Elias. Keep it up ! Julien Blanc I got it this morning ! Help me out. I'm uncomfortable. Go slowly ! That hurts. Okay, okay. Ma'am, could I have a pen and paper, please ? - What for ? - You'll take care of the shop. It'd go to the dogs if we closed. Got it ? - Do you need anything ? - No, nothing. "Toreador, toreador !" That's how much I've had it with you ! - I have to go. - Stay a bit. If I'm still alive tomorrow, it'll be a miracle. What's up ? - How're you ? - Hi, Elias. - What'll it be ? - Those cutlets there. Sure thing. Youssef won't be mad ? - Like with the rack of lamb ? - No. No, leave it like that. - Just weigh it. - Of course. As you wish ! I made this dish just for you. - Can I take off the blindfold ? - Not yet. - It's weird... - Wait, don't cheat ! It'll ruin the fun. Okay, so what're we doing ? You need to smell the aromas and describe what you feel. It's a game to win 10 million euros, right ? Do it for me. Inhale... Meat. That's a good start. Lamb with spices and vegetables, but I'm bad with veggies... - Not bad, but not quite. - So I haven't won ? I don't know. I don't know. Hold on. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. - One last chance. - Wait ! Guess. It's a small fruit. A very small red fruit. With a tart flavor... Currants ! That's it, currants ! I won ! They were currants, I knew it. It's amazing. You made this ? Hold up ! Is it for me or for you ? It's for you. Thanks, chef. I should go. - You're not going to finish ? - I have to go, Elias. See you tomorrow ? Bravo ! So this is what you've been doing while I've been dying ! Easy there ! You'll hurt me. - They let you out ? - No, I escaped. - I couldn't take it. - You're crazy. No sleep for six days. How could I with a bear in my room ? - I'm going to rest. - Wait. No, I'm fine. - What're you making ? - Brioche. - Has anyone been coming to eat ? - Yeah. Today we had six German hikers. Hello. Hi, Lotfi. How's it going ? Fine, Youssef. - Have a seat. - Thanks. Tea ? - Elias ? - Yes ? - Two teas. - Your arm's better ? Yes. So... - It's Salma - Your niece ? She left early today, thank God. She's in the plane now. Good riddance ! You should've seen it, Youssef. She acted like she was in France. Going out... The make-up, the cigarettes... She'd come and go as she pleased, with whomever. I'd never seen that before. May God forgive us. You'll work things out. Elias ! Are you all right ? I'm going to get some fresh air. Did I teach you to rob your friends ? Give me that. And that's it. That's it. Lower your eyes like a coward. Get the fuck out of here ! And don't come back ! But take the money, go ahead ! Sorry, Yous. And you're running off like a thief ? Why'd you do this ? I have to go. Where to ? Paris for that girl ? Paris for work. You understand ? Come, sit down. Come on, you dummy. Youssef, what're you doing here ? Hello, Malika. We need to talk. Is there a problem with Elias ? No. But I came to talk about him. He wants to go to France ? You want him to end up like Marouane ? As long as I'm alive, he's not leaving. Malika, I'll take care of everything: the paperwork, money, travel... I even have a cousin who'll host him in Paris. I said no ! His life is here. Elias has a gift for cooking Thanks to you ! He could work in a great restaurant in Paris. Quit lying ! How would he work without papers ? I don't want him to end up like Marouane ! Marouane believed in all that, too. Elias is my only child left, you understand ? I know, Malika. But he deserves to have a chance. The new season of Super Chef ! Six chefs, six weeks of competition overseen by three-star chef, Julien Blanc. Only one will be the super chef ! "Come by my restaurant." Liar. Idiot. Think he'll show ? I don't know.

I'll say I saw you. They'll be relieved. It's crazy. In Paris ! They're crazy in the village, thinking you died or were in prison or kidnapped. I can't believe it. Now that I've found you, I can't let you go ! Elias in Paris ! Come on ! Why didn't you call ? You would've had help. Help ? Help to go back to the village. You could've gone back. Go back ? Sure, but... I never would've gotten a second chance. Elias... What's up ? You have to go to Tazzeka. Your grandma's sick. What ? Is it bad ? I don't know. Everyone's worried about you ! You have to go care for her. Back to that awful village without any cash ? "Hi Gran, I'm broke but I'm here !" - They'd understand. - Understand what ? That they'd believed in a loser ? - That's it. - So what's your plan ? I'll earn money then go take care of Gran. Fuck ! Oh, sure, so that's it. Yeah, I'll earn some money. And what ? You don't think I can ? You think I'm a clueless villager, is that it ? That's what you'd call me here, a villager ! That's it. Look at me ! I'm a villager. - It's not that. - Of course not. It's not what I meant. Elias Elias. I'm sorry. What're you doing ? What am I doing ? What're you doing lecturing me ? You left without a word, without a goodbye. - It's messed up. - Because we kissed that once ? You thought we'd marry, have kids, happily ever after ? Salma, stop it. Forget you ran into me. Forget you talked to me. Elias ! You can forget me but not your family ! Are you doing all right ? You need cheering up ! We'll go out tonight. Here, come on, take this.

Look, stir this up. - I don't know. - No, go ahead and try. And don't stop, okay ? - You doing all right ? - I think so. Wipe the semolina off your hands. And we've got a triangle.

You're welcome. How's it going ? Tired ? No, I'm fine. You've got golden hands, Elias. Who taught you to cook like that ? My grandma. She taught me everything. She raised my brother and me. - You have a brother ? - Yeah, Marouane. Marouane. Nice name. He died crossing at Gibraltar. I'm sorry about your brother. - Your grandma's alone in the village ? - Yeah. - She's sick. - With what ? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know ? - I haven't had the strength to call. - You can't not talk to her ! You have to call her. I know. - Elias... - I just can't. You can't just say, "I just can't." You have no right ! You don't get it. Then explain it to me. I can't go back. It's too late. Take it. - She'll ask when I'm coming back. - I know. My kids ask me the same thing. The dead protect us, Elias. They watch over us more than we do them. Hello ? - Hello ? - Hello. Who's speaking ? It's Elias. You okay, Elias ? What's wrong ? Grandma's dead. She's dead, Souleymane. Cry. It'll do you good. Will you go back ? I don't know. I ask her to marry me, but she says, "You're married !" So I say, "But I'm allowed four wives, no ?" I need two guys for today. Okay, we're in. You're not coming ? - Your friend's not doing well ? - On the contrary. He's doing better. There you go. Enjoy, Chef. What is it ? A soup my grandma'd make for me as a kid. Semolina barley soup. Surprising. Warm milk and barley with a hint of olive oil to bring out the cumin. It's simple. Simple yet delicate. And I made biscuits to accompany the soup. May I ? They're really good ! You have "duende." - What's "duende ?" - "El duende." That added unnameable flavor that can't be taught. Thank you, Chef. This one's also good. - You'd said your hands were tied. - Unfortunately. But you can help me out. - Sir, anything else with the soup ? - Nope. Wait, that won't do. - I'll give you this - Enjoy ! Try a taste of this with the soup. Thank you. Enjoy ! - A top restaurant ! - We have to start somewhere. And with the soup ? 90, 110, 120, 130 Euros... 138.50 Euros. 138.50 Euros. We're rich, my friend ! I've got an idea for tomorrow. - Curried Jerusalem artichoke velouté. - What's that ? A vegetable from during the war. Off to a good start. Is it good ? Yeah, it tastes like artichoke. It's a Joël Robuchon recipe. Joël Robuchon ? Never heard of him. "Joël Robuchon..." The secret to the Jerusalem artichokes is that, when they're simmering, you add a bit of honey so they'll slightly caramelize, and sprinkle on the curry to bring out the flavors. And your Robuchon couldn't put in a good word for us ? May you rest in peace. My dear grandma. Hello. Hello. Are you Elias ? - Do you know me ? - Youssef's always going on: "Elias this, Elias that, he makes the best tagine, pastilla, couscous in the world. Even rack of lamb !" Just thinking about it gives me a headache ! Where is Youssef ? Out, so I'm in charge. All right. Elias ! You're here already ? - And I'm glad to be here. - Me too. You can head home. It's late. Goodbye. Turn around, show yourself off ! - How's it going in Paris ? - I have something for you. - What is it ? - Open it. Paris Honors Young Chef's Talent TAZZEKA Subtitles: Register
