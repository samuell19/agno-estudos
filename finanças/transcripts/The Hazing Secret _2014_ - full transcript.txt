♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Okay, it's recording. What do you want to say to Nancy? To Nancy! Our new ASB President and Goddess Divine... Who infuses the scent of perfume where ever she goes... She's the strongest woman I know... And has the best rack on the row. Amen! Okay. Okay. So, this begins day one of my psychology case study: social exchange theory and bonding in a sorority. I expect a lot of tears. Shh. Oh my god, you're still studying! We know you are going to write a brilliant psych report but Nancy will flip if she sees books out. Your commander-in-chief wouldn't allow it on a night like this. Pour, please. Gwen, you have got to stop slumming. You think that guy was bad? I caught this one making out with Mike. Kim! Again? He was just scared because things between us were getting too real. Looks like Mike's been reading Cosmo. He hardly has the initiative. But if you're happy, baby, I'm happy. A toast! To my sisters! I never would have been elected student body president if it wasn't for my chicas. Sisters for life! ♪ ♪ Prince Charming awaits... Sorry I'm late. I was drowning in depositions, and being a good intern, I couldn't say no. That's okay. I know you hate these things. Hate 'em. Shouldn't you be studying? I am! Field research for my psych report. Now, I'm going to need you to answer a brief psychological survey. Academic purposes only. Question Five years? Five years. We will be living in a very elite gated community. I'm going to be a full member in the firm. Nice. I like where this is going. You're going to be pregnant with our first kid, we're gonna have three. - Three? - Or more. Do you want more? I'm going to have to think about that one. Oh, Porsche Boxster, I'm gonna have one of those too. Best car in the world. Uh, what else? I see your BFF is here. - Dude. - Dude. What's up, dude? Hey, Megan. Hey, Trent! You're looking good. Oh, yeah, you think so? He has a thing for you, and for her... ...and for her and for her! Smart. Playing the numbers, huh? Nah, I'm more of a hopeless... Dude! None of that hopeless romantic stuff here. Okay? None of that. Bryan! I'm trying to help the guy out. You know, being top in a psych class you think he'd know a little bit about the ladies. I don't think he needs any help. You know how to get the ladies don't you, Trent? Get us some drinks. I'm going to find your sister. I'll see you, Megan. Split a cheesie? ♪ ♪ I thought Kim loved me. But maybe it's time to give up on true love. No! No! You can't give up. Why not? Don't you want that kiss in the rain-stand in the surf- run to the end of the earth kind of love? You're drunk. I'm eighteen. That's legally impossible. When did that ever stop a sister of Delta Zeta Alpha? True. But you can't give up on Kim. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't? Because, Mike, you have so much to offer. You really believe that? Yeah. It's like you know me. Turn that off! Let's go, let's go. Meeting. Now. Kim, that dirtbag isn't worth it, okay? I love Mike! You're filled with love and maybe a little too much trust. You know, if anyone should be crying rignt now, it's Melissa. She's just a drunk freshman, let it go. The only reason we went easy on her is because she's your boyfriend's precious little sister. Okay, Nancy, maybe we should go back to hazing. See how long it takes for us to lose our charter. This is what happens when girls don't get hazed. They don't learn loyalty. I don't want to get anyone hazed. If she wants to be a part of this family, she's gotta learn. No! That's right. It's time for her final exam. I'm sorry, Nancy, so sorry. I'm such a mess... I don't want to embarrass you. Jesus, she can barely walk. Why is that here? It's a Delta Zeta Alpha tradition. It traces back to our founder, Doris Yelton. Legend has it, the school was going to shut Delta down. Our radical mother wheeled this coffin to the middle of Ainsworth Union, she tied her hands and feet with our colours, symbolizing the unbreakable bond of sisterhood. She stayed in there for three days until the school reversed their decision. Three days without food, water or sunlight. She lived on the ideas of friendship, faith, and fortitude. When she stepped out of this coffin, she was no longer a woman. She was a legend. So now, any time we take new pledges into the fold, they have to lie in this coffin for ten minutes. But I thought the hazing rituals were banned? You wanna be one of us, don't you? Yeah, I do, but I can't... Pledge, stop speaking. It symbolizes the death of their old life, and their rebirth... As a Delta. Am I gonna be locked in? Yeah, but just for a sec. Don't worry, I'll have the key. No, Nancy, please; please don't do this. I didn't mean to kiss him. That's enough. Back off, Megan. It's not funny! Come with me. No, I don't think I can do this! No, please. Please, Nancy. Please, don't do this. I'm sorry. Please... Just forgive me! Nancy! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Nancy!

Okay, fine. Oh, come on, Megan. Don't be mad. We're just messing around. Hey, it's over. Oh my god. Something's wrong. Don't be so dramatic. Melissa, Melissa? Melissa, wake up! Wake up! Oh my god. Melissa, wake up. What did you do? Oh my god. Hello? Hello? Where am I? What? Good morning, it's me, Megan. Or should I say it's you... or us... I know, weird right? I'm going to throw a lot of crazy stuff at you right now. Don't panic, you're okay. You're healthy, well, physically. Okay, here it goes. Ready? You had an accident five years ago and you've lost your ability to retain short term memory. We can remember everything up until the accident. Everything after that is gone. So it's very important that we make these wake up videos for ourselves at the end of every day. These videos are our memories, they tell us what we need to know about the previous day. We've been recording them for five years, they're all on here. I can't believe I live my life this way. Now, before I go on, you have a doctor's appointment with Dr. Rothman at 11:30 this morning. Trent? He's trying to help us get to the bottom of this nightmare we keep having. Yeah, you know the one. Okay, I think that's it. You are now ready to start your day. The key to the door is under the bed. Remember to record before you go to bed tonight. Have a good day. Kim? Hey Megan! Wow - you remember me - You're sharp today! I take it I have better days than others. Do we see each other often? At least once a week. And the others? Not nearly enough. But that's something we're hoping to change. There's a reunion next week for all of the sororities and fraternities. It's going to be epic. Everything's paid for by the Panhellenic association. Tickets are in the envelope. Please come. Delta Zeta Alpha just wouldn't be the same if you weren't there. Oh wow. Um, okay. Maybe. Sorry. I'm just a little confused right now. Do you think this is something I can handle? Maybe it's just what you need. Just think about it, okay? Okay. It seems your nightmare continues to be the same in almost every detail. I wouldn't know, so I'll have to take your word on that one. Does it still seem like what happens in your dream is actually reality? It has to be. How long have we been doing this? Five years. With no change? No improvement al all? It's not the same as an open wound, Megan. Time doesn't heal everything. Well... Maybe it is time to see someone else. Someone who can maybe fix this. No offense. There are other methods, but they are extremely dangerous. I took your case pro bono when I was a grad student. I fought for you, Megan. I believe a familiar face will help you recover faster. I remember... you were in my dream. That means your memory is improving. That's good progress. Perfect. Every day I line up these cards in the same order. You may not consciously recall it, but as you see, the memories are still there. Deep down in your subconscious. Your case is quite unique. Most cases of Anterograde Amnesia cannot retain declarative memories for longer than a few hours. In one case, the patient experiences a "wake up" every thirty seconds. I'm not following you. It is the interval between memory loss. Yours, well you are able to retain your declarative and episodic memories until you go to sleep each night. Then why do I keep remembering something that never happened? I believe you have memories that are trying to work their way through from the subconscious to the conscious, but on their journey they are becoming jumbled. The dream is a manifestation of your guilt. Your inability to protect Melissa has had a profound effect on your psyche. I know it feels real, but it never happened. Melissa's death was ruled a tragic accident - just another example of an inexperienced youth succumbing to alcohol abuse. Melissa was looking for a place to rest, she got trapped in the coffin, there was no one near to help. None of your other friends were ever there. I can show you the police report if you like. What about my accident? It happened shortly after Melissa's death. You jumped from your sorority house. You were in a coma for three months. I'm sorry? You mean... You're saying I tried to commit suicide? Every session I have to break this to you, it just never gets any easier. I'm sorry. I just saw Kim before you got here. She invited you to the reunion. Be with our friends who share the same memories. Yeah, right. Memories of the girl who tried to kill herself. I'm sure they'll be thrilled to have me around. Don't say that. Are you gonna be there? Would you like me to be there? Unfortunately I can't get there until Saturday since I have a few regular patients I can't reschedule, but if you need me in the mean time, I'm just a phone call away. You need to do this Megan. If Dr. Rothman is right, maybe this little reunion will help trigger our memory and we won't have to record these videos anymore. Wow, that would be nice - one can hope... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Megan! You made it. I'm so happy. This is going to be the best weekend ever! I'm glad I came. It's beautiful here. Isn't it amazing? Come on. Let's go find everyone. I hear Trent's coming. Yeah, but not until tomorrow. Bryan is already here. You remember him, right? Yeah, but nothing recently. Trent said he was a bit of a you-know-what to me the last time we saw each other. I've got your back, girl. Nothing we can't handle. Well, well, the Prodigal Sister returns. We have a lot of catching up to do. And right when Nancy got Mike out the window, House Mom Betsy comes banging on the door. Starts screaming about Nancy keeping a harem of men. That woman was a nightmare. Do you remember after we fired her she came back? Because she wanted to sue us because I wouldn't give her the garden hose. It would have only cost you a few extra dollars if you just gave her the hose. A good leader doesn't cave so easily. I like this one! I might keep her around when I run for mayor. Nancy is a staffer for a senator in D.C. And I'll be her trusty campaign manager when she's ready. If her mom can spare her the D.A.'s office. Wow, you've done so well for yourself Nancy. All of you-really. I wish I had more to share about myself. Oh come on, you're just being modest. You were always so smart. Are you still making those little movies? I'm making different ones these days. Like podcasts for my memory. We really wanted to be there more, we just thought seeing us would maybe make it worse. It is my biggest regret that I didn't see the warning signs. I really should have noticed. But we're here now. Whatever bug you've got in your brain - we're going to kick its ass. Okay, how about we open the orientation packages? I'll save you the trouble. These are the best things in the packet. Pass those down. We will have to keep these close for the toga relay. Or get a head start. There's something in them. Maybe they go together. Who did this? Girls? Girls. Gwen spent a lot of time organizing this weekend for us. Let's not let some stupid prank ruin it for everybody. Right? Yeah, come on. Drunk frat boys and girls dumb enough to think it's cute. Look at them. They have no respect for all the work I've done for this weekend. We need to get the events back on schedule. Guys, don't you think we need to do something about these notes? Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right? No! People will listen to you. Get them over to our events sign-in station. Megan, you can help me with the team-building exercise. Seriously, guys? No one is even a little concerned about the message? More than a prank, don't you think? Honey, that's what people do here. You're over thinking it. Just... we're on vacation! Just try to forget... I mean... Please, just try to enjoy yourself. We're going to play a game. The three-legged toga relay! My lovely assistant is passing out laurel crowns. Whoever has a crown that matches your colour is your partner. Partners line up over here! So, looks like we're... Let's just get this over with. On your marks, get set... Go! Step, step! Come on, keep up! Keep up! I'm trying! What are you laughing about? We're going to lose. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Over the shoulder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have a winner! Way to go, Megs! You two - shameless photo-op. Let's go. Get together. A little closer. Okay, cute. Be sure to pick up your prizes at the administrative booth! I've got to go. Can we just talk, please? You didn't want to talk when Melissa died, I don't want to talk now. It's okay, Megs. What a jerk. I say good riddance. What happened between us? Um... Bryan was really messed up after Melissa's death, and then there was your accident. He couldn't deal with it. And you, you were so depressed, Megan. You just kind of checked out. We should have known something was wrong. We weren't there for you. But from now on we will be. Guys, what's this video? Oh, is it recording? Oh my god, it's Melissa. Hi, I'm Melissa and I am so excited because today is the first day of the rest of my life! I'm a Delta Zeta Alpha, yay! Is this some kind of joke? Still think it was a prank? All right. Who's doing this? You think it's one of us? It has to be. Which one of you sent the text? Is someone trying to break our pact? No one would benefit from that, Nancy? What pact? We were all together. We all got the text at the same time. It couldn't have been one of us. Except maybe those of us with a guilty conscience. Let's not blow this out of proportion. Can somebody tell me what we're talking about? She doesn't remember, Nancy. That video was something that Megan would have recorded. She was videotaping everything back then! What did you do with the videos, Megan? She already told you she doesn't know what happened to them. - Kim, shut up! - We need to just tell her! Shut up! Megan, I don't know what you are trying to do here, but I don't like games. I don't like being played. I really don't know what you're talking about. Oh, right. Because you forgot, isn't that so damn convenient. She's one of us, can you stop? Kim, shut up! Why don't you go have another drink, or are you on the wagon today? Oh, right, you fell off. Hi, where are you? I don't think I can do this. Megan? Are you all right? Nancy is accusing me of doing something I didn't do, or at least don't think I did. I don't know, did I? You have to work through this yourself. You cannot take what other people tell you as fact. You need to remember it yourself. You're getting close, Megan. Someone sent us a video today of Melissa. The girls said I was the one who took it... Megan, you're an easy target for these women. Just be mindful of everything you do.

Oh my god, Kim? Megan, help me! Where did he go? Where did he go? Who did this to you? I don't know. He was wearing some kind of mask. It's locked. Megan, get it off! I don't... I can't reach it. Just hang on. Megan! Megan! Oh my god, is that gas? Is that gas?! Is that gas?! I think so. Get me out of here! Get me out of here! I'm trying! Let's get this off you. Come on, come on. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Get this off me, get this off me! You're okay. It's over! It's over, it's over. Oh my god. What's going on? What are you doing out here alone? It's over. This is ridiculous, okay? It was probably those Phi Delta boys messing around. Those idiots are pretty sick. It isn't a joke. Someone slipped a note under the bathroom door asking specifically to meet me here. Like this one? You got one too? No. This was Kim's handywork. It's a sick joke. No, are you kidding me? Someone tied a rope around her neck and hung her from the ceiling! Nancy, someone wants to hurt us. I heard voices in the woods before I found her. If you don't believe me then come see for yourself! Fine. Okay. Take her back to the room, get some rest. No, Megan. Let's go, Megan. Don't go. Don't... I swear to God, this better not be a waste of time. I'm telling you I heard the voices, our voices, from out here. From right here. Well? "Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone." You know what, Megan, I'm getting real sick of this! Where did you find that? The note? The box. Where did you find this? This is the key box, it's never supposed to leave the sorority house. What are you talking about? Do you expect me to believe that someone just planted this here for us to magically find? Someone wanted me to find this. I'm telling you there was someone out here. I heard our voices, I'm sure of it. Megan. Megan, where's the key? I don't know! But our coffin was in the shed. Show me. Now. I don't understand. I swear it was right here before. Honey, maybe it's time you called Trent and went home. I'm not making this up. We have to find who's doing this. Calm down. We have to call the police. We are not calling the police. Look, she was bound with our colors, our robes, they obviously knew the Doris Yelton history and they are messing with us. Let's go back to the resort, we'll talk to Kim, I want to hear her side of the story anyway. If you can't handle all of this maybe you should call your shrink. Megan, is everything all right? I just got your message. Oh, thank god. I think - I think I may be hearing things. What did you hear? Voices. Nancy's voice, but she wasn't there. It was like coming from a tree or something. I'm sure that sounds totally crazy. Megan, take a deep breath. Kim almost died, and then I found this cryptic note. I don't know what's going on. Calm down. Is Kim okay? I don't know, she's freaked out. Do you think that there's anyway I could've done something while I was awake and not remember it? I suppose it's possible, but highly unlikely. This trip is putting you under mental duress, and you may experience some form of hallucination or memory lapse. I'll be there soon. When? Just try and stay calm 'til I get there, you may just be reacting to the new medication. Just try and stay calm, and keep taking notes in your tablet until I get there. Please hurry. Her brain is scrambled, she can't be held responsible for anything. Would you like to take responsibility for this? You should know more than anyone that Megan is dangerous. Megan only has power over us if we decide to give it to her. Megan didn't do this. She couldn't have. How do you know? Because she's not even going to remember how she got here in the morning. How the hell could she orchestrate something like this? Megan doesn't even know herself anymore, She's capable of anything. Someone went through the trouble of providing us gowns, let's not waste them. Look Megan, they even wrote a little note. "Athena - goddess of logic and reasoning." "Persephone - goddess of the underworld." When did you have time to put all of this together? You're starting to sound like Nancy. I didn't do this. Oh, I saw you put those in the suitcase. When did you go through my suitcase? You put it on my bed. I was just moving it out of my room. It was over there. In the closet. Whatever, I, for one, am happy to play Queen Hera. Thanks for the dress, Megan. You're a doll. I don't know what you're talking about. Guys, cut her some slack. I heard you in the woods. I heard all of you singing the bid song. Oh, honey. I know what I heard. I have dreams of that night, every night. That song, that was a message. Someone needs to tell me what's going on. Crazy! Can you please cut her some slack? I think Kim was attacked because she wanted to tell me something that someone didn't want me to know. Kim? What are you talking about? I'll throw out a wild guess. She thinks I did it. Look at Kim. She looks like she's about to jump out her skin. But Nancy would want us to just sit back and take that intimidation, right? If I were trying to intimidate you, you wouldn't be guessing. You would know it. I'm tired of everyone blaming each other. I'm outta here. Kim! Let her go. She just needs to blow off some steam. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thanks. Hey, come on. Let's get out of here. You don't get to touch me. Let's go before... Before what? Why don't you make yourself useful and get me another drink. Bye. Glad to see you're enjoying yourself. Don't you dare. Kim, how many of those have you had? Not nearly enough. Kim, please, you're smarter than this. You know what, I almost died today, okay? I think I deserve a few. Did we not come here to party? Who wants shots? You guys need some shots. Lighten up. Are you proud of yourself? Hey. Hey. Can I sit here? If you want. This is... I thought it would be different coming here. I don't know what I'm doing here. Me either. That's not true. I came here to see you. You're going to think I'm crazy... But when I saw you, it's like this wave knocked me over. And just like it was five years ago, all the anger and sadness came back. I'm so sorry. I needed you, Megan. I needed you so much. And you just cut me off. What? You were the one that didn't want to talk to me. What are you talking about? You were the only thing keeping me together. That's not what Gwen told me. Why would she say that? I don't know, but you kind of went off the radar for a while, Megan. I don't think anyone knows what was really going on with you. Nancy says she doesn't know what I'm capable of. Maybe she's right. It's scary, knowing you're the exact same person you were 5 years ago but still not knowing who you are. I'm glad you haven't changed. You were a beautiful person to begin with. You know for the first two weeks we were dating, I totally thought you had a stutter. When you took me home to meet your family, Melissa said she had never seen you so nervous in front of a girl. Mr. Cool couldn't even get a sentence straight. She told me that right then and there she knew you would marry me someday. I think what hurts the most about losing my memory is finding out that I lose you. Every single day. What's it like? Oh, you know. Kind of like Groundhog Day, except I don't remember it. I keep notes on what my friends are doing. Most days I don't see them. It's like reading stats about someone else's life. It sounds like you're as confused as me. I even dropped out of law school. You what? I was so convinced the police missed something - that it wasn't an accident. I became a cop so I could look for myself. Sounds insane, but... Bryan, there's something going on I feel so confused... Megan, we need to talk to you. Can it wait? I'm in the middle of something. No, it can't. Excuse us, Bryan. Nice to see you. What do you think you're doing? He's a cop. I know. Then explain to me why you're talking to him. I don't need to explain myself to you. Actually you do. Move! Please, get her! Come on. You, call 911. Get back! Get back, get back, get back, go! Come on! Everyone, get back! Get back. It's going to be okay. What happened out there? You tell me, Nancy. What are you talking about? You said that if you wanted to intimidate me I would know. That's ridiculous. Look, I was with Gwen the entire time. And where were you? With Bryan? Where were you two? You know damn well where we were. You guys interuppted us while we were sitting on lounge chairs. That's not how I remember it. Are you sure that's where you were? Listen to me. She can't be sure of anything. She doesn't even know who she is when she wakes up. Where are you going? To Bryan. You don't even know him anymore. A lot has changed, Megan, it's been five years. You yourself said this wasn't a joke. Kim is dead. She was a really good swimmer. There's no way that this was an accident. I don't know what to believe anymore. She was drunk! Do you know how many people go swimming when they're drunk and drown? It was an accident. Was it? Megan, we were there for you when Bryan wasn't. Where's my tablet, Nancy? What? What are you talking about? Get out of my stuff. I don't know how that got there. Whatever! I'm out of here! Megan! Gwen. We have to stick together. I hope you remember that, at least. Dr. Rothman will be here soon, and then I'll remember everything. You can count on that. Be careful what you wish for, Megan. You may want to keep some of those memories buried. Why don't you just go get some sleep? You know, wipe the slate clean. That was unfair, even for you. You know the police are coming. We have to tell her. Tell me what? She wanted to betray us. If she doesn't remember, good. We were all there that night... Gwen! No, the night in your dream... the night Melissa died... We made up the story. Gwen, stop it! My dream is real? It's a memory? How could you keep this from me? What is wrong with you guys? I have to tell Bryan. No, you don't. Because Bryan is a cop. And if you tell him then we're all going to go to jail. And for what? Because somebody wrote us a letter about something that happened five years ago? No. Because Kim is dead and because it's the right thing to do. I know I have problems, but guys, how are you living with yourselves? Melissa was our friend, our sister. This is ridiculous. We have to tell him. He lost his sister. Stop. You're delusional. Seriously? Someone out there already knows what you did. He's going to find out one way or another. What we did, Megan. All of us. Nancy? Shut up, Gwen. We all locked Melissa in that coffin. Every single one of us did it. What? No. That's not what happened in my dream. Don't do this, Nancy. It's true. I couldn't have. Don't you think it's a bit convenient that you don't remember anything from that night? No. If you tell anyone, we will all be locked up. So go ahead, run to the police. But you killed her too, Megan. You killed her too! No! I... Uh... So many lies, I think you're starting to believe them. Oh, come on. She was the only one. The only one who tried to save her. It's very important you don't sleep until I get there. You'll lose all your progress, and we're so close to a breakthrough. I understand. I'm on my way. I'll see you in the morning. That long? It will be very early. Hey Megan. Remember, you're the strongest person I know. Okay. Good morning, it's me Megan; or should I say you? We didn't do anything. Megan... You must remember this. Your dreams misled you. We killed her. As soon as Trent gets here you must take responsibility for Melissa's death. What are you doing? Huh? "Our never ending quest for right." We sure did stray from the path. Gwen, you were there. Why would I have done anything to Melissa? I have dreams of that night, of what happened, but it's different. Maybe it's just what I want to believe. Megan, you didn't do it. You didn't lock Melissa into the coffin. Nancy did. And we all played along. Not all of us, not you. I don't understand. You fought us. You tried to prevent it from happening. Just like my dream. She lied to me. We all lied to you. We all lied to you to protect ourselves. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't regret what we did. But Kim's dead, you're on the brink of whatever is going on with you and... and I just want all of this to be over. This is all Nancy. She did all of this! She has manipulated and deluded us into turning our backs on what is right. Do you think she killed Kim? Absolutely not, no. Then who? I don't know. Bryan? Mike? I don't know but if there was a flight leaving now, I'd be on it. I'll just have to wait till the morning. Are you staying awake? I can't close my eyes. You know what happens when I sleep. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I probably won't get any sleep either. Be careful. You've got to be kidding me. Hey! Get over here, huh? What are you doing? Hey! You okay? Yeah, I think so. What are you doing, man? She attacked me. He had roofies in his closet! What? Are you gonna believe her? This crazy chick, she broke into my room. You attacked me in the house! What are you talking about? Okay, calm down. Calm down! Bryan, get off me, man, before I... Before you what? Assault a police officer? Before I lawyer up. How does that sound? I will sue you for everything you got, man. Okay, get up, get up. Come on, get up. What is wrong with you? Let's go, Mike, I'm handing you over to the police. It's so quiet here. I was expecting to feel calm, but this place is kind of eerie right now. What's going to happen to Mike? They'll try to hold him until the toxicology report comes back. But if they find any trace of roofies in Kim's body, he's going down. I never said thank you before. I don't know what I would have been done without you. You're lucky Gwen asked me to keep an eye on you. She's worried about you. I'll be fine. I just need to get out of here. You're not allowed to go anywhere unfortunately, Megan. This is a crime scene under investigation. Are you investigating me? Well, we're going to be keeping your friends behind too. They're going to want to ask them about Kim and, uh, your mental state. Mental state? He was trying to kill me. There's a lot more to this than date rape. I wish I could tell you but I'm still trying to figure it out myself. Listen, we have him now. I know this has been stressful for you. Stressful? But you're safe now. You need to try and pull yourself together. Megan. Megan! I'm so glad you're here. I should have been here sooner. How are you feeling? I'm alive. Come. We have a lot to sort through. You're so close, Megan. I suspect you only need a push. What is that? I would like to try something new. Tap into your unconscious memories using an experimental hypnosis procedure. Is it dangerous? Not at all. In fact, when we're done you'll feel like you've had a full night's rest. I will be guiding you to make sure that we get all the information that we need. I'm exhausted. Okay, I'm ready. Wait! Sorry, I'm... I'm kind of scared. It's just... So much has happened. I'm... I'm not sure if... Everything that happened will be wiped clean. It's okay. We will be able to get you to hypnosis without you completely falling asleep and thereby wiping your memory. Focus on the pendulum, Megan. Appreciate that you can let your body relax deeply. Let the calm seep into your muscles and allow all of the weight of your body to drift away. Farther and farther. Deeper and deeper. Feel reassured that this deepest part of your mind can be relaxed and soothed. You have no worries. You are falling into an infinite pool of calm. When you wake up, you will be in a safe place. Now let's take you back to that night. In the sorority basement. ♪ Oh mother dear we sing tonight ♪ ♪ Of love forever true ♪ Stop it, let her out! What is wrong with you?! ♪ Delta Zeta Alpha ♪ I finally got the key, but it's too late. I'm so sorry, Melissa. I was supposed to protect you. I'm so sorry. We had a pact, Megan. We all swore until death. Okay? So if you talk now we're all gonna go to jail. Do you understand that? This is our future. What about Melissa's future? You never thought of that. I have to tell the police. I can't do this anymore. Megan, don't be stupid. Okay? Nothing you do now will bring her back. Look at Gwen. She just got a job at the District Attorney's office. Kim is taking over her family's business. And I just got into law school! I can't let this ruin our lives. I won't let that happen. I can't live with this secret anymore. You don't have a choice, Megan! Okay? If you tell then you'll have to deal with the consequences. What are you doing? The pact is only supposed to be broken by death, Megan! If you don't want to die I suggest you keep your mouth shut! I'm going to count to three, Megan. On three you are going to wake up. One. Two. Three. Talk to me, w-w-what did you see? Where are you going? I need to find Gwen. Megan? Megan! I am so sorry. About everything. I should have known it was Mike. Where's Gwen? You're crazy! Where is she?! I'm not telling you. I won't let you ruin everything. It's too late for that. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm so sorry. Megan, wait. Help! Gwen! Someone help me! Megan! Gwen! Megan! Gwen! Megan! Megan, help me! Help me! Hold on! You can't fall asleep, okay? Don't fall asleep. Gwen. Gwen, Gwen, please wake up. Gwen, did Nancy do this to you? Megan? It's okay. Come on, let's get help. Let's get up. Okay? Just rest against this. Just rest here. You okay? Yeah. Gwen. Gwen, you're safe now, I'm just going to go get help. Okay? I'll be right back. I'll be right back, I promise. I promise, stay here. Stay here. Bryan! Bryan, oh my god. Nancy is trying to kill me. I know it sounds... We killed her. As soon as Trent gets here you must take responsibility for Melissa's death. It was you. You were chasing me. You... you... You! All this time you've looked me in the face, all of you... No... You're a liar, Megan. No... I'm going to make sure you get what you deserve. Megan! Megan! Megan! Megan, Megan, whoa, whoa, whoa. Talk to me, what happened? It was Bryan. He's the one who did all of this. I'm such an idiot. My friends tried to stop me from telling him. But I didn't. We have to call the police because they're coming for me right now. They need to know what's going on. The line's dead, and there's no cell reception here. Why is this happening to me?! You're not meant to live in this confusion, Megan. You were made for greater things. You have such talent, such intelligence. The only way to reclaim your life is to come to terms with your memories and move on. I'm here to help you with this, Megan. But maybe... maybe... maybe I'm just crazy. I should have told someone about Melissa when it happened. Now Kim is dead, Gwen almost died and Bryan is trying to kill me. I never should have kept that stupid pact! Maybe then Kim would still be alive if I didn't. No, Megan, evil is not in your nature and this is not your fault. You girls took something from Bryan. He lost his sister and now he feels entitled for revenge. He is the crazy one. He's trying to kill all of you and he won't let you leave here alive. We need to get out of here. It's him. Run, Megan. Don't stop for anyone. Open up! Open up! Where is she? Where is she? Pardon? You can't protect her. You are always trying to keep her away from me but not this time. Not this time. What she did was wrong. I will find her! No, no, no, no, not! Not now. Her therapy is almost complete. All that remains to be seen is whether she remembers once she wakes up. Do you think I care about that? Get out of my way. You have no idea who you are protecting, do you? Megan! Megan! The police are on their way. I'm so sorry, Bryan. Calm down. Okay? You have to come with me, all right? You're not well. I won't let you kill me. Calm down. I thought you loved me. Trent? It's okay. It's okay. I'm here now. Everything's going to be okay. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Help! Please let me out, please let me out! Please let me out. Stop it! What is wrong with you guys?! Melissa? Melissa, wake up! Does it still seem like what happens in your dream is actually a reality? Reality... reality... You're awake. Please, please let me out! But is your subconscious? This may seem somewhat of a severe method, but I realized that I was getting nowhere in my therapy. I had to try something new, something... Dramatic. Showing you your old videos didn't work. What you needed was an extreme form of trauma to trigger your memory. I couldn't break it's hold on you unless I could recreate it and shatter it. Please, please let me out. In order to unlock your mind, I needed to establish the same atmosphere of distrust from the time of your accident. And this reunion presented me with the opportunity I'd never had before; all of you together in one place. Kim... Kim... Kim was the biggest obstacle. I had to get to her quickly before she could tell you everything and spoil the whole thing. You're the worst one of all. You were supposed to be the leader! And yet at every crucial crossroad you chose to dig your friends a deeper hole. Megan! Megan! Yeah, I don't think that will happen. Please! Shhhh shhhh shhh shh. I need absolute silence for this. For years I had to live with the truth that I was a stranger to the woman I loved. Come on. I knew I was your memory but I wanted to be your heart. I tried every day to make you fall in love with me. Do you know how hard it is to make someone fall for you in one day? I did all of this for you, because I love you. It's a shame Bryan won't be here to take his revenge, but at least he will get credit for it. Every good crime needs a patsy. Wait! Trent, Trent, remember. I remember everything now. You do? Every minute that we spent together. Every look, every touch. I remember it all. I fell in love with you over and over again every day. And then like nothing, you'd forget. Yes, but I know you understand that it wasn't you. You were the only one who cared about me. You're the only one who ever truly loved me. You never let go of me. I would never let you go, Megan. I know. I know because... Because you and I, we're soulmates. We are meant to be together. I remember it all now. I love you, Trent. You know... I'm still the only one who's ever been inside here. It's like a true marriage of the minds. I knew my treatment would work. You were right. You are going to make history with this breakthrough. We always were a good team. I can't wait to start our future together. Wait. Megan, Megan! Wait. Megan. I am so sorry. About everything that happened. But... but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I mean we're... we're in this together, right? Sisters are for life. You are not my sister. Am I under arrest too? Gwen told me everything. I remember now. I tried. I really did. Melissa was my sister too, you know? And I wanted to protect her. I know you did. Bryan... I never stopped loving you. To me, it feels like it was just yesterday that we were together. Well, it's been five years. A lot can happen in five years. Yeah, I know. I understand. Are you sure? Yup. Megan... I never stopped loving you. I kind of owe you my life. Ah, forget about it. I'm going to have to find a way to repay you. We have our whole life for that. And I'm going to make sure it's a long one. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
