I had a really good time with you tonight. Me too. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - No, no, no, no, no, fuck! What the fuck? - Are you sure you don't wanna cancel this weekend? - What are you talkin' 'bout? Why would we cancel? - My brother just got outta rehab. Tyler seems depressed or something. I don't even know the last time we talked to Margot. I just feel like we'd have more fun if it was just you and me. - C'mon, it's my birthday. Do you realize it's been almost two years since the five of us all hung out together? It'll be like old times. Hey, come in. Abby's here, hun. - Hi. - Hey. - What's wrong? God, I'm so... - Abby, you didn't do anything wrong, okay? If he was cheating on you, you should not beat yourself up. - I didn't say he was cheating. - I mean, he's got pictures of girls on his phone. What's the best-case scenario here? You should just come with us, have fun, let loose, forget about the stress for one weekend. - And Winston won't mind? - No, not at all. Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled. - Abby? Why would Abby come? - I think it'd be good for her. Mitch is kind of a douchebag. - Okay well, it seems like you're meddling again. - Again? - Yeah. Do you remember that girl that you catfished that your brother was dating? - That girl was white trash. - But do you remember when we used to hang out every weekend? Now all we do is work and sleep, work and sleep. I know everyone has stuff goin' on. I just wanted one weekend where we could hang out like we used to. - You're gonna get that, okay? I'm sure it's gonna be great. - Promise? - Yes. I'll make sure. - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, it's Margot. You know what to do. - Hey, it's Winston. I haven't heard from you, but I'm just gonna text you the address and hope to see you there. - Look, don't let him force you. This is typical Winston bullshit. - I'm not letting him force me. It could be fun. And it might be nice to you know, put it behind me after everything that happened. Get outta my head for the weekend. If you don't go, who am I going to make sarcastic comments to all weekend long? Please. Please, please, please, please, please, please. - Jesus fucking Christ. - Please, please, please. - Okay, fine. I will go. I'm gonna be late. - You're an angel. - He is not ready. - You know what? We probably just need to wait 'til the end of the cartoons. When the cartoons are done, he'll be done. - Okay, all right. Can you please just take it easy on him this weekend? - I didn't say anything. - I know, just give him a break. Listen, I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to be mad at me. - That's a good start. - Julia invited Abby. She didn't tell me. I just found out. I think its gonna be fun. I think it's gonna be good for you. I don't think it's gonna be a problem. I really don't. I think it'll be fine. I honestly do. Car ride'll be fun. We could do stuff in the car that you like. - This fuckin' sucks, dude. - I know, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get your bag. - Winston fucking Russo, my man. Happy birthday. Gosh dang it, it's so good to see you. Hey. I'll get this. You can get in. - Hi. - You can take the outside. I'll sit in the back. - Hey bud, you scooch? - Yeah. - Scooch a little bit. Can you move over a little bit? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay. Hi. - So did you guys pick a date? - What? What? What? - Did you guys pick a date? Sorry. - What? - I was just asking about your wedding. It's kinda hard to. Yeah, no we'll talk later. - Hey, check this out. - For sure. - Isn't that tight? - Yeah. - Dude, look at that. - So funny. I don't have any service out here. - Yeah it's kinda nice, right? - Yeah, we're in the middle of the desert. - It's kind of the point. - Here we are? - Yeah. - Look at this place. - It says to park outside the gate, so that's what we'll do. We stopped. - This is. C'mon. Nate, I think that's where your bunking - Okay, you take this. Here. - Thank you. - That's for you. This is also for you. All right, I'll take these. - Thank you. Yeah, look at this. Perfect. - Yeah, it's great. Very humble. I think the Pentagon uses a similar security system where you just slightly push the door open. Stop it. Aha. - Ooh. - Look at this place, hun. - I thought you said that I go in first. - Nice. - Very nice. - Very nice. - Very cool. Hello. Welcome to Casa Bandaresa. I'm Doug, property owner. - Winston, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Winston. Well why don't I give you quick tour? - Okay. - You got your two spare bedrooms here and across the hall. You got the master for you and the Mrs. This is great. - Private bathroom. - Okay. - Yup, you got the whole side of the house for yourself, so nobody'll be able to hear ya. You got your washer/dryer. Nice. - Yeah. - Is this a closet? - This is private. This is my private property. I'll ask you to respect that. Sure, I'm sorry. - I wanna show you something. I think you'll enjoy it. Okay. What is this? - These are some of the rarest instruments of combat in the history of civilization. This is my piece de resistance. This is a special limited edition Deutsche Waffen und Fabriken manufactured Luger pistol. Number eins neun sechs. Do you realize what that means? - I do not, no. - It was issued to an officer. That piece of machinery in your hand belonged to a high-ranking member of the SS. It's impossible to say which. Why do you have this? - It was passed down to me by my grandfather. So your grandfather took that from a Nazi officer? - No. I always lock this up before I leave town. Better safe than sorry. Right. - Right here. Kept you pretty well-stocked with water and perishables. The nearest store is about 20 miles. - Yeah, I noticed that. - Got your pool and hot tub out there. That's self-explanatory. - Self-explanatory, right. So hey, I noticed there's some cell-dead spots up here. Yeah, the cells generally drop once you pass Caya Tamazula. But there's some you know, random spots where you can pick up service. Cool. Do you know where those spots are? - No. - What if something happens, like an emergency or I don't know? - Emergency, yeah. Well you got the landline right there and for anything else, use the WiFi. That modem is the best money can buy. Most governments don't even allow it. Well, I've got a flight to catch. But one last thing before I go. I know the Airgency has terms and agreement, but I like to do mine face-to-face, you know, friendly-like. Yeah, I see that. - So, you just sign it. Sign what? Terms and agreement. Okay. - We'll just take this out right now. Take care of my house, Warren. - Okay, it's Winston. Is it just me or did anyone else think that guy's completely normal? - Normal guy. - Normal guy. - Normal guy. - Lovely guy. Yup. ♪ There is just one thing ♪ ♪ Left here to say ♪ Ooh baby, hittin' that vape-vape. - Yeah. Man. How you doin'? - Doin' good, just tryin' to deejay this thing. - Yeah. Well that's kinda why I came over here actually. You think I could change the music by chance to somethin' like... Not really feelin' it? - I don't know, maybe somethin' more upbeat or party-like, you know? - Sure, yeah. What're you thinkin'? - Literally anything else. Yeah. - Get off of your phone. - What if he's tryin' to reach me, but he can't because I don't have service? - I'm gonna throw it in the pool. This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna throw it in the pool. Who cares if he's tryin' to reach you? He's the one that asked for a break. You deserve to have fun. Right? - One night. - Taste this, this is very good. - It's about animals, but it's commenting on society. It's actually an allegory for gun control. - See, we're done. You have fun. - Yup, one night. - We're gonna put this here and we're not gonna think about him. We're not gonna talk about him and we're gonna have fun 'cause we deserve it. I'm really excited to put it out actually. - Hey, sorry to cut you off. I'll be right back. - Sure, yeah. Thank you for changing the music though. - Okay, yeah. You're right. - Right about what? I couldn't help but overhear. I don't know, I been going through some rough times and I have gone through some rough times. - Be back, sorry. - Excuse us. She's great. Havin' fun? Yeah, just deejayin' this thing. I'm like Funkmaster Flex in here, ya know? - Yeah. I don't wanna get too sentimental, but I'm glad you came. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. - I appreciate that. - Yeah. 'Cause we used to do this all the time. - Yeah, boys gettin' back out there. Boys gettin' back out there. - With some girls in the mix. Yes. - With some douches in the mix. - One step forward, two or three steps back, right? - Yeah. - Just by powers of deduction, I could probably guess guy trouble? - Is it that obvious? - No, I mean you keep fidgeting with that. - Except I'm tryin' to find faster music so that Nate can hit on the woman I'm in love with at the speed he'd like to. - Stop it. Don't worry, he's harmless. - He's harming me. - It didn't work out and that's okay, you know? We are the sum of our experiences and I'm here with you because that didn't work out and I like who I am. - Have you heard from Margot? No, why? - She hasn't responded to anything and she was supposed to be here. She doesn't seem just different to you lately? Doesn't she? - I don't know. No. No. - Maybe it's me. You're overthinking it. - That could be. Man, I'm so sorry. You look really sad right now. - No, it's fine. No, it's gonna be great. - Knock, knock. - Who's there? - Interrupting cow. - Interrupting cow. - Moo. Yeah, see? - Thank you. - There you go. That smile looks pretty good on you. - Thanks. - You know. Hey, Winston. - Hey, Abby. - I know me coming was kind of last minute and I just really appreciate you letting me tag along. - Yeah, no, I'm glad you came. - Yeah, you did some BuzzFeed stuff, right? - Yeah, I mean they asked me to do a couple things for 'em. - I love BuzzFeed. List, list, list. Very clickable. - Well I want you to have a nice birthday. Thank you. - You're welcome. - I hope you're havin' a good time. - Hope you're havin' a good time. - I'm havin' a great time. - Are ya? - Nate just got outta prison, right? - It was court-ordered rehab, but sure. He's actually been so open about it and he has such a good heart. It's really been a good experience. - That's great. - Yeah. - I've heard from several people that coming back from prison's a typically great experience. I'm gonna grab something from the kitchen. - Well it wasn't like that, but okay. - Do you want anything? - No thanks. - Want more wine? - No thanks. - No? What's poppin'? - What's up, dude? - Tyler, hey. - What's goin' on? Hey. - I feel like I haven't had a chance to talk to you all night. - Yeah, it's kind of been... I was very busy. I just feel like I haven't seen you in forever. Everything's good? Mitch is good? - Yeah. - Good. - Yeah, everything's good. How 'bout you? What've you been up to? - Super great, actually. Kind of cool news: I am getting published this summer. I just hooked up with a little publisher, so been doin' some short stories. - That's amazing. I'm so happy for you. - It's no big deal. But it is a big deal, yeah. - Are you drinking again? - Yeah mom, like a couple. I hate when you call me mom. - Okay, well don't be mom. - Well just be careful. I'm just looking out for you. - I know. - But like, just be careful. - I know, I know. - Okay, I trust you. - Thank you. Thank you. - You're welcome. - It's a new year, okay? For me. - New you. - This is just a couple of these. - Maybe it'll be a wedding gift, right? It should be comin' out around that time. - Yeah. - Yeah? That must be exciting and stressful and crazy, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? Are you interested? - In Abby? - Yeah. - I mean, she's a little hottie. But she's engaged. - Yeah. No, she's not. Just between you and I, okay? You can't tell anyone. They're split. - Are you seein' anyone? - No, no, no. - Well, good. Single. - Yeah. - Single, livin' it up single. - Yup, livin' it up, livin' it down. - It's very recent, but they've been over it for so long. He's bad. He's bad for her. She's ready. They've been over it for a while. She's ready. We did say we're gonna go slow. Mom, mom. - Okay, I'm not tryin' to be mom. There's the guy. Yes, this guy. - Yes. - We are here because of you. - All right. - Having fun. - All right. - Cheers. What do you guys think, shots? - Sure, yeah. - Yeah. Do a little shot? - I will do one. - One tiny one? - I will do a light shot. - A little one. Tyler, there's no such thing as a light shot. - Pass this along to him. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. All right, put your glasses up. - Okay. This is to Winston. To Winston. - Winston. - Happy birthday. Thank you. I love you, pal. - Whoa, I love you too. Thank you for getting older. - You're welcome. I'll keep doin' it. I have an idea. Hot tub? Hot tub, hun? - Sure. - Do you wanna do it? - Yeah. - Hot tub time? - Yeah, you know yes. - Let's do it. - Hot tub adjacent. - Yeah, you can sit on the side. - I'll sit on the side. - That's great. Tyler, get in the tub. What're you doin'? - He doesn't have to if he doesn't want to. Yeah, get in. - Hot tub workin'? - I'm callin' Doug. This is ridiculous. Can't figure out the hot tub, can you? - Yeah hi, it's Winston. How'd you guess? I get the same call every Friday at 10 p.m. You're actually ahead of schedule. - Right, I checked the... Control panel by the wall, then the remote, then you gave up and called me. No worries, my friend. I'll send over Joe and he'll take care of it. - Wait, who's Joe? Aren't you in Mexico? Fucking creep. - What was that? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? - I don't know what that was. - Lotta people are just reclaiming wood and then charging double for it 'cause it used to be in a barn, which is why you get stuff like this. - Right. There he is. There he is. Hey. - Hey, party police. - Joe? - Yeah that's me, Joe. I'm not really a police officer. Whoa, hello model club. - That's the gang. - This is a handsome crew and a beautiful crew. What are we celebratin' here? - It's my birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - What is it, sweet 16? Quinceanera? - Wow. Yeah, right. It's just out here. - Yeah, sure. - So I'm pushin' buttons. I don't know what I'm doin' out there. Okay, yeah. No, it's no big deal. Honestly, like really anyone can do it. - Okay. - The adults are a little too old. It'd be freaky if there were no kids. - Wow. - Anyway, this thing gives people fits. Don't beat yourself up too much. It's just really basically that. It's just one button? - Yup, just the one. Tub time. I thought Doug could've told me that over the phone. - Happy birthday. - Okay, all right. - Basically hit just a couple buttons. It's so easy a caveman can do it. You remember those? How did they find cavemen in this day and age? - I don't know. - That always kills me. - Very easy. All right, thank you so much for coming by. - Yeah. No, my pleasure. Seems like a great group. You guys look like you're gonna have a great time tonight. And you know, that's good that some people out there are gonna have fun because you know, we shouldn't all feel lonely, right? It's good to have people havin' a good time. You know, I got some action figures I've been playin' a Survivor game with. I got little tiki torches for 'em and I think Captain America's on his way out tonight, so I gotta get back to that. - All right, all right. Well, stay safe. - No, you should stay and hang out with us. - Can't interrupt this. The birthday boy. Joe doesn't wanna overshadow anybody. - No. - Can't have too many hunks in the house, right? - Yeah, you came all the way out here to fix our hot tub. Of course. - No, it's my pleasure. It's actually my obligation. It's my job. So if I didn't, I'd be in big trouble. - Yeah. - Yeah. Are you sure that this is gonna be cool with Doug? 'Cause he said, he was like, "No drinking, no partying." Yeah, no, no. No, Doug is super laid back. He just wants you guys to come out here and have fun. - Great, that's great. - Yeah. - He seems like a very laid back fella. - Yeah. - Okay good, good. Good, good, good. - Yeah, let's just kick it. Let's kick it, let's kick it. Is that cool? - Ladies and gentlemen. Boy, whatcha got there? - My little treat. Whatcha got there, Nate Dog? - A little treat for my baby boy. - Whatcha got? - Yeah. - Wow. - You know. A real health guru. - Yeah, you know. It's not bad. Just a little MDMA. Some Molly for the laymen. Okay. - Okay. - It's fine. And no one's ever died on this stuff? - I don't know, man. I don't work for the cops. - For sure. - Lemme get a good bit of that. - They're not even that hard. It's like 100 milligrams a pill, you know? That seems like it's a lot. - Opens your mind a little bit. That's it. - Great. So if I can just put this is in proper context: You were in prison and now you're not in prison and now you're on parole. And while you're on parole, you have a bottle of MDMA. - What? What's he talkin' about? - I wasn't in prison. There's a difference between jail and prison, all right? So that's harmful to tell people that I was in prison. For sure, sure. - First of all. Yeah I don't know, man. My past is rocky. My life hasn't been great and I made mistakes. But you know, I'm tryin' to do right by my own self and everybody else around me. And I feel like right now, I'm havin' a good time. I'm not denying that I fucked up. I fucked up. My past sucks, you know? But like I think everybody's done shit that they all... - I think that is so brave, man. Can I give you a hug? C'mon. Lemme just flop on you, Sammy. You know, you're in quite a happy place. When a man trusts himself, he is finally free to trust the world. - I like that. - You're a brave guy. - Thank you for sharing that with us. - Yeah, it's you know, tough to be vulnerable sometimes. - Yeah. No, I get that. - You want? - Sure. Joe-blow. Here goes nothin'. Here, man. - I'm a Flintstone kid. - No. I mean, maybe just one of the other. - What? - You know, you been drinking a lot tonight. Just maybe wait 'til tomorrow when you haven't been drinking. - That's a great idea. Because it would be terrible if Winston actually had any fun on his birthday. That would actually be tragic to the whole happy birthday. - I'm gonna go. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Come back, come back. - No. They're not even that potent. I'm tellin' ya. Sorry I said anything. - Okay, well. - C'mon, man. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - Ooh, man. - I was just bein' a goof. I was bein' a goofer. Man, c'mon. Really? Hey, hun? Julia. - What? - C'mon. - He's being an asshole. - I know, I'm gonna talk to him. It's just his sense of humor. - No, it's not a sense of humor. It's directly to my brother. It's been all night. - Okay, I'm gonna talk to him. We're all just havin' fun. - Yeah yeah, you're all having fun. You're like slamming drinks. - What? - You said you were gonna go lighter and now you're like slamming drinks. Come on. Everyone. Someone at the back door? - I can't go like this. - All right. - You have to go. - Well, I'll check it out. There he is. There's our boy. Yeah I'm right here, sir. Please open up the sliding glass door, sir. - Hi, how're you doin'? - Hey, how's it goin'? - Hey there, officer. - What's goin' on? - No, not officer. - No, not yet. - Community Task Force. Voice of these people, sir. Wow. We got a call from the station. Heard you guys were havin' a party. Got a noise complaint from your neighbors. Just wanted to come by and make sure everything was okay, make sure you guys were safe. - A noise complaint? - Yeah. - From who? I haven't seen another house for miles. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now take it easy, okay? You're makin' him nervous. - All right. - I'm not nervous. I think he's a little nervous. - No, I'm just confused 'cause we haven't seen any other houses. - We're all on the same side here, okay? We just wanted to come by and make sure you guys were okay. Looks like you guys are partying, havin' a good time. Wanted to make sure you guys were safe, okay? - Okay, yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah, definitely. - Okay. - Is it normal for you guys to come to the backdoor? - This guy. All right, random guess. Are you from LA? - Yeah, he is. Look at him. - You're from Los Angeles. - Look at his haircut, man. - The city of angels. You got angels all over you. Look at this guy. Man. We know you like come out here to party it up. Gotta have fun, drink a little beer, yeah? Smoke a little hashish, yeah? You know what I'm talkin' about, a little reefer? I don't know. - You have a little chronic. - He knows, he knows. Man. Hey, just keep it down, okay? 'Cause everyone around here, they're like 90 years old. Like they'll wake up like that, okay? They don't like to be woken up and they call us, all right? - Yeah. - All right. We're gonna take off, all right? We don't wanna put another damper on your night. - Okay, sure. Thank you. - Have a good one, sir. - All right, you too. - Have a good night. - Goodnight. - Ooh, wait. One more thing. If anything happens, anything goes wrong, don't call the sheriff's department, okay? They are ruthless. - Ruthless? - Yeah. - Yup, ruthless. - Zero tolerance. Doesn't matter what you could be doin'. You make a little noise, shout a little bit, wake someone up, call him in there. He's gonna come in here so pissed off, he's gonna throw you in jail like that. - Yeah. - No shit. - He's a dick. - Real dick. - Okay. Yeah and we know him from high school. - Yeah. - Wow. - Go Cougars. - Okay, good to know. All right. Well anyways, man. - Okay. - Have a good night, sir. - Thank you so much. - All right. - Have a good night, sir. - See ya around. - All right. Thanks, guys. - Ooh, tell Doug we said hi. Okay. Love that Doug, man. - Okay, all right. Hey, everything okay? - Hey. Yeah. - Yeah? - Who was that? - That was neighborhood watch. Pretty nice guys. Yeah. You wanna go back out there? - Yes. - Yeah? - I do. - All right. - No, that's how I got real sick one time. I ate a lotta K crab. Not real, imitation. I just went hog-wild on it. - That's terrible. - Crabby, crabby, crabby. So you guys wanna take a picture for Instagram? - My god. - Yeah, do it. - Yes. - One little pic. - Sorry about that earlier. I didn't mean it. - That's okay. It's fine. Okay, everybody get close. - Of course. - All right, I'm gonna sign up for Instagram and then you better tag me. One, two, three. Aww. - You get it? - Yeah. That's really nice. I wish my grandpa was alive to see this. - Aw, man. - He would freak. - Jeez. - He loved pictures. Yeah? - Yeah, stared at 'em for hours. He has dementia and we lost him. I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. We were close, we were very close. Yeah. What do you do again for work? - Well you know, basically I'm a handyman here and help Doug out. I'm here, you know. I try and spread happiness if I can. I'm feeling great right now, by the way. I don't know what you gave me, but I'm havin' different expectations. - Is that Margot? Hi, Margot. Glad you made it. - Tyler, do you wanna come help me with my bags? - Yeah, I gotcha. This is it. This is the presidential suite. - Really? - Think Princess Diana stayed in here once. - God. - A little while ago. - Yo, it looks like a shit show out there. It sucks. - Yeah. - It sucks. - I saw a couple bars coming in from town. Do you wanna just go out? - No, no, no, no, no. It's Winston's birthday, so I think I'll stay out there. You wanna come out with a beer? - Nah, I think I'm just gonna turn in. Are you okay? I don't wanna leave you hangin'. - Yeah no, I'm good. You sure you don't wanna come outside? Listen, Nate's got awesome stories. Julia has this fun thing where she invents a rule every 15 seconds. Okay, cool. And I wanna drown myself in the jacuzzi. Night. - There's a giant weird person. Okay. It's kind of awesome that you know how to save somebody in a drowning scenario. Did anybody die yet? - Is Margot comin' out? - No, I think she's just gonna turn in for the night. Go to bed. She seemed tired. - She's gonna turn in for the night? Yeah, she said to just say goodnight. - Okay, all right. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go talk to her. - Don't go talk to her. Yes, take two seconds. - Winston, it's not worth it. - I'll be right back. - It's your birthday. - It's fine. Hey, Margot? Margot, could you come out here for a sec? I'd love to talk to you. I would love to know what I did that was so fucking bad. - This is bullshit. I'm okay. It's nice you can actually see the stars. - Yeah, it's great. - Yeah. - Yeah, one time a plane was careening towards the earth and I thought it was a shooting star. - Hey. - And it turned out it was just a United flight. - How'd it go? - It was awesome. - Into a field. Everyone lived. - Is this all whiskey? God. - No, it's other stuff. The plane's speed a pun 'cause it was an airplane. Right, right. - You okay? - Yeah, great. - He's funny. - He's so funny. - I am beat. All right, guys. Well the cuckoo clock in my brain says it's about time for Cinderella to turn back into a pumpkin. I'm gonna head back to my house. - All right. - Yeah. - All right, thank you for the help. - Take it easy. Ooh, I'm gettin' a little dizzy right now. - No, wait. You're not thinkin' of driving home like that. - I didn't drive. I'm just gonna walk. I mean the roads are mostly snake-free at this hour, so it should be good. Think they're seasonal animals. - No. - All right. Well goodnight, bud. - Yeah, have a great night. - Nice meeting you. - No, it's freezing outside. Even the drinking and the pills, I don't think that's safe. No, you should really just stay here and head home in the morning. - You mean it? - Yeah. - Okay gimme a hug, you crazy cook. Okay. - A little squish for you. Bring it in, you are so soft. Thanks. - You're like a blossom. - I'm gonna call you Blossom. - Okay. - All right, guys. Well just gonna head back in the house and wash my face so I don't breakout. #30sProblems. - All right. - All right. - Okay. - Okay guys, have a great night. - Goodnight, Joe. - Whoa, man overboard. - Man. - You guys are fun. - Sure. - Yeah, we like to laugh. Old Bazooka Joe. - What are we possibly thinking? - This is a classic shitty idea. - Why, what? - What? - Why would you invite this guy to stay with us? - What do you mean, why not? - Why not? - He's off his rocker. - He's not bad. He's hilarious. He's just a big fuckin' dope. - You're stoned. He's insane. - He's like a little kid. He doesn't seem like he could hurt a fly. Right. Does he look like he could hurt a fly? - Okay, you guys. You're making it a much bigger deal than it needs to be. It's gonna be one night. No, it is that. - You're fantastically comfortable sleeping with that man in our house? - I'm not comfortable, but it's one night. - It is a big deal. - And he's not. - He might not hurt a fly. But I promise you, you'll wake up with him fuckin' jerkin' off - or he'll do somethin'. - My god. He's a fuckin' weirdo. - You are just being a bully. Why are you bein' such a jerk? He didn't do anything to you. - I'm sorry. No, you're right. Okay, I'm gonna go to bed. - No. - And I'm not lookin' out for the group, so I'm gonna go ahead. - Tyler, wait. I didn't mean it. Sorry I ruined your night, you guys. - I didn't mean it. - It's okay, I'll go talk to him. Hey. - Hey. That was rough? - Honestly, it's cool. Why the fuck is she into him, man? I know you entertain him, but you know he's a fuckin' piece of shit and her fiance's garbage. I honestly don't understand what the fuck is so wrong with me. I'm sorry. I wanna go home tomorrow. Okay. - I'm gonna have Margot take me. I'm sorry. - No, that's fine. I understand. No, that's good. - I'm not gonna have a good time like this and I wanna celebrate your birthday with you, but it fuckin' sucks for me, dude. - It's okay. I get it. It's all right. Get some rest, all right? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. No no, it's fine. It's fine. - All right. - Okay. Hey, what're you doin'? - Goin' to bed. - No. - Yes. - Why? - 'Cause I'm sleepy. It's late. - Well who's even still out there, Nate and Abby? - Yeah. - All right. Well I think I'm gonna go. I'm gonna have one more. You're gonna have one more? Don't drink a lot. - What? - Just don't pound it. - No, I'm gonna bring one out to sip on to be social. Here we go, here we go. What up? - What up, what up? - Hey. - Hey. - Look what I got. - How're you doin'? What do you got? - Check it out. - Wow. - Wow. All right, all right. - We're gonna do it. - Somebody's enjoyin' the birthday. We're doin' it. - Are you havin' fun, bud? - Fuck yeah. - Yeah, man. - It's awesome. That's nice. Baby, that's nice. Fuck, that is nice. All right, boom. Good stuff. - Yeah. - You guys wanna do yours? What? Like what? - It's stupid. - Why? - Here we go. I just feel great, I don't know. It felt great. - This is great. - I feel great. Coming out here was... - Should make that stuff taste better. - Weird, I guess 'cause it was cold. You guys want one? - I don't know. Bottoms up, man. - Bottoms up. Cheers, buddy. - Don't gotta tell me twice. I didn't know what to expect. Yeah. This is nice. Right, it used to be? Get the gang back together. The gang back together. - It's great, right? Isn't it great? - Yeah. - Right, buddy? - Really great. Yeah, man. - This is awesome. - Back together. - Thank you guys for comin'. This is awesome. This is insane. This is what I needed. This is exactly what I needed. Right? It's 'cause I think things have been not what I thought. - Things are great. - Not what I thought. - Yeah? - It's so great. Not what I thought either. - I know. I know, I didn't think it'd be like this, you know? But we're here now together for the weekend. I really appreciate it. It's nice, you know? I didn't think Jules is never really not working, you know? And I'm tryin' to get my stuff goin' and it's just not been good. Not been great, so it's great to see you guys. Right? All right, I'm gonna head in. - Are you? - Yeah. - Aw, man. Hey. - What? - Happy birthday. Happy birthday. - All right, happy birthday to me. Happy birthday. - Isn't it so beautiful? - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothin'. - 'Kay, you're obviously upset. What's going on? - I don't know, maybe that your engaged friend is out there hooking up with your brother. Really? - That's funny? It's not a big deal. - Not a big deal? - No. They split up. - What? Abby and Mitch split up. - Does Nate know that? - Yeah, I told him. Unbelievable. Why didn't you tell me? - Because you would've told Tyler. No no no no. Yeah, it's 'cause that would mess up your whole matchmaker weekend, right? - Why are you coming in here so nasty? You're like yelling at me. - Tyler tried to fuckin' kill himself when he found out that Abby was engaged. - What? C'mon stop. You knew that. - You never told me that. - You fuckin' knew. - How am I supposed to know that? - I didn't know Abby was gonna be coming on this fucking trip. I've been spending this entire weekend tryin' to make sure Tyler's okay - and now... - My god. Okay, this whole weekend's about you taking care of Tyler. Come on. This whole weekend is just another reason for you to get fucked up again. - Wow. Fuck you. - Wow. - It's so beautiful. - Yeah, everything is just better out here. - You just feel happier. Yeah. Yeah, everything looks better. - Everything sounds better. - Everything feels better. - Feels better? Yeah. Yeah. - My god. - What? What are you doing? - I think somebody's coming onto the property. - What? - Yeah. - No. I think you're crazy. You're being ridiculous right now. - I had a really good time with you tonight. - Me too. - I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm gonna go get changed. - All right. - Yeah. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Access denied. - This fuckin' guy. Hi. Hi. Yikes. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Just with the Margot thing and Tyler. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. Sorry. - It's okay, I forgive you. You do? It's your birthday. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Abby. It's okay. - Did you sleep out there? - Do you wanna come to bed? - Did you sleep okay out there? No, no. - I didn't really either. - You didn't? No, there was like some weird popping. I don't know, it sounded like gunshots. - What? What time is it? 8:30. - Ooh. - Morning. You all right? You seemed a little weird last night. - No, just tired. - You sure? 'Cause I came to your door. It was locked. Thought that was a little weird. - I was sleeping in a strange house. It's not that weird. What is your deal? You won't text me back, you won't call me back. You won't talk to me right now. - Way too early for this. - Chewing. Access denied. - Okay, for fuck's sake. Door's locked on you? - Yeah, Doug. How'd you guess? Darn security system goes into full lockdown sometimes. - Security system? Maybe a coyote got in the floodlight or somethin'. - Do I need to set something up or how does this work? I showed you how to yesterday. - Pretty sure you didn't. - Access granted. - Have you forgotten? It's definitely in the binder. If you need anything else, I'm only a phone call away. - Thanks, Doug. Did I hear my tea? - Hey. Yeah, sorry. I got caught up cleaning. - That's okay. Margot, hi. We didn't see a lot of you last night. You were sad. Yo, who's that random guy on the couch? Right. It's Abby's little friend, Joe. Remember she invited him to spend the night? Yeah. No, this is great. What a fantastic idea all 'round. - Hey you got a new job, right? - I just make personalized goods and sell them. If you wanna call it a job, sure. That's like Etsy. - Yeah. Yeah. - That's cool. - Yeah. - Good for you. What are you selling? - You know, I heard some shouting by the pool last night. Like it was loud enough to wake me up. - Shouting? We didn't hear any shouting last night. Right, Jules? No. I didn't hear shouting. I heard like popping. My goodness. I got real good last night. - How did we sleep? Like a drunken log. Okay. Do you wanna talk with me outside real fast? Yeah, okay. - Did you hookup with Abby? - What? Yes. - You did? - You told me to. - Okay, well I'm not like your pimp. - Okay, but like you know. - Yeah. - Your boy closed. Sealed the deal. - Okay. That feels weird. - I have to tell you something. - Okay. - Do you promise not to freak out? - It depends. - No, we can't do that. You have to either say yes or no. I can't tell you unless you promise. - Okay, I promise. - You know Tyler? Yeah. - He tried to kill himself over Abby's engagement to Mitch. - What? When? - Yeah, recently. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah. - Why wasn't that brought to my attention before? - I don't know. I just found out. - My god. - I know. Man, I can't go for it now. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. - No way. - I love her. Everybody loves her. She's a great girl and you can continue this. Just like keep it together for this weekend. It's not a big deal. Man, well Jesus. - Can you do that for me? - Yeah, I mean you know I will. - Thank you. - It just sucks, you know? Like knowing that and then this whole weekend's gonna be ruined. I saw this guy in the bushes last night when I was makin' out with Abby. - What? Yeah, yeah. I didn't tell you that? - No. - Yeah, we're in the hot tub and like I was leanin' in and I saw somethin' behind her. There was like a guy. - You saw a guy? I mean it looked like a guy. - You know what's so weird? I thought I was hearing like gunshots, it's what it sounded like. It was like popping. - Out here? - Yeah. - The fuck is going on here? - I have no idea. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - Hey, dawg. - How're you doin', man? - How're you doin'? Enjoy your b-day. - Yes. Hi, honey. - Hi. - Hey, man. Hey. - How're you doin'? - I'm good. - There's the guy. How're you doin', bud? - I'm good. - Did you get some sleep? - Yeah. Where's Margot at? Is she up yet or what's up? - Margot is in her room. 'kay. Is anyone hungry? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Starving actually. - You hungry? - I saw a grill outside. Thinkin' we could grill up a little lunch, some hamburgers. - Which'd be good. - Yeah? Yeah. - Okie-doke. - All right. - Here we go. Let's get this baby fired up. It's probably the Clapper? Grill on. You boys need help? - Nope, we got it. - No thank you. Old Nathaniel knows his way around the old propane grills. - Why don't you just stare at a rock for a while, buddy? - Why's everything gotta be very complicated in this house? Been doin' that all day. - It's fine, it's not. Hey, everybody. - Hi, Joe. - What's goin' on? Birthday grillin' feast? - Yeah, well tryin'. - Havin' a little trouble? It's certainly not too hard. Here you go. Turn that one on too if you want it. Pretty simple, but it does throw a lotta people. So again, don't feel too bad. - Table of champion. - Bazooka Joe. - Hi. - So you're dumb. - Hi. - And you are? I like your necklace. Okay, nice to meet you. I'm Joseph. Thank you, Margot. - I don't know, you shoulda seen her this morning. She was being fucking crazy to me. - Margot? - It's so weird. Yes. - I'd let it go, man. She's fine. She was goin' through a little bit of a thing this year. She was? - Yeah, she had to borrow a little bit of money from me. But she paid me back right away. - What? - And she's good. - She borrowed money from you? - Yeah. - Why would she borrow money from you? Why didn't she ask me? I make more money than you. - It's not about how much money a person makes. Just you guys aren't close right now. - That's not true. We used to talk all the time. - You used to talk. - Exactly, so what's going on? - Okay, I'd like to let it go. - Let it go. - It's fine. She's fine, you're fine, everyone's fine. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - I think I'm gonna go. - You are? - Yeah, after lunch. - Come on, my birthday weekend. - I fucking can't, dude. - All right, it's okay. I get it. - I'm sorry. - No, it's totally fine. - I'm sorry, man. - Don't worry 'bout it. I get it. And also the last thing I'm gonna say about it, she's definitely hiding something. - Let's let that be the last thing you say about that. - Done. Done and burgers are done. - Done. - Okay. All right, here we go. - Ooh, baby boy. All right. Those look great. Hey Emeril, thumbs up. Thank you. I'm gonna wake up Abby and tell her lunch is ready. Abby? Hey, you've reached Abby. Sorry I couldn't get to the phone. Leave me a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. - I'll tell you if I did jujitsu, I could crack someone open. - Well, you gotta get class first. - Have any of you seen Abby? I can't find her. - No. - Did she sleep in your room last night? - No, I don't even know her last name, dude. Why would she sleep with me? - Is she in the bathroom or somethin'? - No, I looked all over. - Nate, would you possibly have any idea where she slept last night? - I mean, I can tell you where she didn't sleep 'cause she didn't sleep with us. Maybe she slept-walk the whole night. - So nobody knows? - Still give a solid eight if you're walkin' all the time. - I'll come help you find her. - Thank you. Is she over there? - No and her luggage is missing too. - Her luggage is missing? It's not here. - Well where could she be? - I don't know. She's gotta be here somewhere. - I don't feel like she's here. I feel like we've searched the whole house. - That was very filling. - We cannot find her. - Margot this might sound weird, but I think maybe Abby took your car. - I Ubered here. I didn't drive. What? - So that's not really possible. - You took an Uber from LA? Yeah. Why? I didn't feel like driving. - So you took a 2 1/2 hour Uber? - Can we just focus up here? I'm a little concerned about my missing friend. Okay, I got up and went to bed at 5:30 and the house was on lockdown 'til the security system turned off at nine. - Okay. - All right. - And then. - What time did you go to bed? - I mean, I came in from the hot tub around 2:30-3. Straight to bed. So somewhere between three and 5:30. - All right, this might sound kind of crazy. What if she got kidnapped by the drug cartel or somethin'? We're in like meth country right now. Come on. I mean, I told you this is a sleepy old folks town. - Honestly, she probably just went into town. That's like the most realistic option here. - No, she was drinking a lot and she never drinks. She probably, I don't know, if anything she wandered off into the desert. - Well, that would be very bad if she wandered off into the desert alone because that's usually a one-way trip unless you know what you're doing. I happen to have a desert survival pack that I will go get. I see you all looking very nervous right now and I'm taking that energy and I'm gonna collect it and hold that burden for you and send out some positivity real quick. Okay, I'll be right back. Nothin' to worry about. - Okay, no one thinks he's at least a little bit suspicious. No one thinks that's weird at all. - Like I said last night he's a goof, but he's harmless. He slept on our couch the whole night. - I don't think it's a coincidence, man. He's the only person here that we don't know and all of a sudden Abby's missing. And if someone did something to Abby, it would be that guy. - Who said anyone did anything to her? Sounds very wide. - All right, guys. Do not worry, Joe is back and I got the gear to find Abby. Dear god. - Okay, I got some stuff to illuminate our path in case that beating sun doesn't do the trick. Couple extra flashlights. All right, Sport Sunscreen Spray. That's very important. We're gonna wanna keep our bodies protected from the sun. This here, very important. This'll suck poison outta anything, okay? Do not let anyone tell you to suck it out with their mouths. Now I got three bottles of water here. All right and this right here is not just a fun-looking keychain. This is a flint stick. Chink, chink, chink. Fire, okay? All right. Well, who's with me? Margot, just the two of us out in the desert? Could be fun. - I really appreciate you thinking of me, but no, absolutely not. - All right, moving on. Winston? We're driving into town. That's great. You'll love it there. It's beautiful. Thank you. So looks like it's the three amigos? I'm just glad you guys are gettin' a chance to see our little community. So you're writin' more, man. That's cool. - Yeah, man. It's been good. This trip's kinda nice, you know? - Dinosaurs come here to fertilize their eggs. - Writing's important to like observe people and there's a lot of fascinating characters on this trip. - She's still not answering her phone. - I'm sure she's fine. - She probably went into town to call whatever the fuck his name is. Why wouldn't she just use her cellphone? - 'Cause there's no service. It's like 10 miles away in the middle of the night. And the car won't start. - You fuckin' serious? - What? Yeah, I don't know. I had a half a tank yesterday. Did you leave the lights on overnight, dude? No I didn't leave the lights on overnight, dude. Do you want my brother to take a look? - Your brother? - He's good with cars. Your brother's good with cars? Yes. - Your brother doesn't know shit about cars. Goddammit, this is just what we need. - Shit. - What? What? Is that hers? Yes. - Emergence of Airbnb, VRBO. One guy named Sneaky Pat tried to open up just a bunch of mats on the ground. So you know, we've had a lotta extra income comin' in. Doug's making good money, but not everybody's thrilled about it. I mean I personally love you kids comin' in from LA and you know, show your wild side off. But a lotta people are tryin' to get you all banned from being here. - I don't understand that. - Yeah, it seems wrong to me too. - I'm just gonna go to my room. - I'm gonna try and call Abby. - Okay. Okay, okay, hold on. Hey, what's up, man? How's the hangover, dude? - Hey guys, how's it goin'? Hey, that drunk hits you really hard out here. It's the dehydration. If you're not used to it, the dryness, it gets you really hard out here. - Right. Listen, we got a bit of a problem here. What's goin' on, man? - This is gonna sound crazy. We can't find one of our friends. What do you mean you can't find them? - We woke up and she's just gone. We think she may have gone into town, but nobody knows where she is. Holy shit, LA. Well hey, you did the right thing by callin' us first. If you had called the sheriff, things would be much, much worse by now. - That's exactly what I was thinking, so I called you guys. We were gonna go into town, but the car won't start. What? Man. I hate it when that happens. That's the worst. That's not good. - We don't really know what to do here. Well shit, we're like all the way out here in Hemet right now takin' care of some business. But we can call Tony, see if he can give you a tow into town. - Tony? - Yeah, yeah. He's the only shop in town with a tow truck. - Really good guy. - He's a great guy, great guy. Best guy I know. We'll call him up and tell him to get over there to you ASAP. - Yeah, that would awesome. Thank you guys so much. Yeah you got it, good buddy. Good luck, LA. - Thank you so much. All right, bye. - What'd they say? - Well, they're gonna send a tow truck. - Okay, should we call the cops? - Call the cops? Yeah. - No, I don't think we need to overreact. This is gonna be fine. We're gonna get into town. We don't need to overreact. These guys are takin' care of it, all right? - I'm worried. This: again, I know I sound crazy, but I have to just speak it out loud. But I just can't get what you told me last night outta my head about Tyler. You don't think he'd like do anything to her, do you? - What do you mean? You think he like hurt her? - No, no, no. Not hurt her, just I don't know. He's obviously very fragile right now and he's like locked in on her. - No look, Tyler's not capable of hurting anybody. We're all friends here. Nothing like that happened. I'm positive. Okay? - Okay. - Wanna take a shower? - Yeah. - All right. - Yeah. - I'm gonna try to talk to Margot. - Good luck with that. - I know. - So is this like drug cartel land, man? - Nah, no way, man. You been watchin' way too much cable TV. This is as innocent as apple pie out here. Although, we did have a dog stealin' bacon from the local diner, so I guess they don't all go to Heaven. I don't know, man. I feel like I get a gritty-meth vibe out here. No, I don't think that's the case. - Hey, you guys. Bullet shells. There are a lotta hunters out here and it is buck season. - A lotta people hunting with pistols. - Sometimes you gotta shoot 'em execution-style to prove your point. - I don't know, man. I think this is weird. Yeah that does seem kinda weird, Joe. - Hey, you guys. I think we should just go up this way, honestly. There's a little shortcut. Yeah, but. - Let's get back to the house. We came from this way, didn't we? - Yeah, the thing is that there's a lot of slips and falls that way. And if you just go up this way, it's a clear path. Honestly, it's in your best interest to just go this way. - Hey, can we talk for a second? - Sure. - Can I come in? - No. - Okay. Tyler mentioned that you're goin' through a bit of a rough patch, so I just wanted to talk to you and let you know that I'm a friend and I wanna help if you just talk to me. - Yeah, so now you wanna be a fucking friend? - What? - You knew I lost my job and the first time I hear from you is for your birthday weekend? - That's not true. - What about Tyler? I'm the one who's been there for every fucking mental breakdown and every phone call at three a.m. Okay, you know what? - He calls you the day that he attempts suicide and you didn't fucking answer. That's not what this is about. - But what, you pick him up from the hospital and now you get to be a fucking friend? - It's not what this is about. - That's what this is? - No, that's not what this is. I wanna talk to you because ever since you've gotten here, you been so fucking weird. You took an Uber here. You're guarding your door and your luggage. I haven't talked to you in a month. - You know what? This entire fucking weekend was supposed to be canceled and you knew that, but you wanna make it Tyler. No, it's about you. It's about you doing drugs, getting fucked up. - That's fuckin' bullshit. That's bullshit. You know what? You're hiding something. - I will fucking scream. Honeys, we're home. - Yeah, I mean the block seems pretty good and belts are all lubed up. You know, I'm gonna level with you, man. I'm used to American muscle. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay well, we'll tell Julia you put on a good show. C'mon. - I mean it's gotta be somethin', right? Definitely something. - God dang it. - Hey. - Hey, what's goin' on? - You know, kinda freaked out. How're you doin'? - I'm doin' good. I'm a little tired from that hike. - Yeah. - All things considered, I guess I'm fine. - You're fine. - Yeah. - I'm very concerned about Abby. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. - I hope she's okay. - Yeah, you're freaked out? - Yeah, I mean we didn't really catch a trace of her out there. - You guys were looking pretty hard. - Yeah, yeah, as hard as one can look at a bunch of fuckin' sand. - Well, I'm really concerned 'cause obviously she means a lot to me. - Yeah, yeah. - She means a lot to you. - Yeah I mean, everyone cares about her, right? - Yeah, but like you'd be concerned if something happened to her. - What are you tryin' to say? - I'm just saying like it's nice. Like I can tell you'd be very concerned if something happened to her. - We don't know, what? - Right? - Yeah I mean, yeah. Yeah, I'd be concerned if anything happened to her. Okay, I'm gonna go inside. - Cool. - Yeah, cool. - Hey, my man. - No. - All right. - Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fucking fantastic, Winston. - Hello? Hey LA, did you find your friend? - Not yet. How's it goin'? Hey, I got a little more bad news for you, unfortunately. We talked to Tony. He's willing to come by, but he's way a way at his daughter's soccer game out El Centro, so he's not gonna be done for a couple hours. - Fuck. Isn't there anyone else? There's really nothin' else for it, but the sheriff. If you want, we can go ahead and we can call him on your behalf. We can let him know you're a good guy, we'd mention we spoke to you and that whatever happened, happened. You know, it's not totally your fault. And it's way better than you calling and having him put an APB on a missing person. You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, we'd do that for ya. - Yeah, I get it. All right, so think long and hard and figure out if that's somethin' you wanna do. It's a big deal. Let us know. - Yeah. - Will do. All right, man. We're gonna wrap this up over here and as soon as we're done with this, we're gonna race over there, help you out, buddy. All right, LA? We're gonna get you outta this. Getcha. - Fuck. Fuck. - Look, her bags are still here. - That's not a good sign. - Right? - Why wouldn't she have taken her bags? - Maybe she's comin' back, you know? Maybe she just went into town to grab a bite to eat or somethin'. - It's 10 miles away. I don't think. She hates walking. - Look, I don't know where she is, okay? We can speculate all we want. But she's gonna turn up, all right? Everything's gonna be better and then we'll look back on this day and laugh. - I mean, I wish I had your positivity. I really appreciate it. I hope that you're right. What're you doing? What's going on? What is that? We absolutely have to call the cops. I'm not sure why we're waiting. We need help right now. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't call the cops. I'm on court-ordered rehab and we were doin' drugs last night. - I'm sorry, I just think it's strange that the last person who was with her doesn't wanna call the police. - Okay, well the guy who tried to kill himself over her would probably be a little upset. - All right. - The fuck, dude? - It's not what you think. I told her so that he wouldn't hook up with Abby. - Cool, man. Cool and that worked. Abby wasn't even supposed to fucking be here, Winston. This whole fuckin' trip sucks. It's all about you draggin' people along for your fuckin' birthday. The whole thing fuckin' sucks. - You're absolutely right. It's my fault for my have a birthday party. I'm the asshole. I didn't have anything to do with Abby missing. I'm the bad guy, I'm the bad guy. You're making it all about you, dude. - No. - It's fucking not. - Stop. It's not his fault, okay? He was trying to help. He's trying to be helpful. - Yeah and for the record, I think it's probably some sort of drug-coyote-cartel situation. Come on. This is a quiet town. It's mostly senior citizens paintin' ceramics. - Seriously, dude. Why are you so convinced that somebody killed Abby? Like this is getting fucking ridiculous. Hey, you guys. The gun's gone. Good, great. Where's the gun, Nate? - Fuck off. - You fuck off, dude. What am I gonna do, steal a gun? - Yeah, I think you're gonna steal a gun. I don't know, I'm not a violent person. Your brother is a criminal. I don't have a fucking criminal record. This guy's been to prison more times than fuckin' actually if you fuckin' think about it. Fucking relax. I'm talking about your lifestyle. I'm sorry your friend lied to me. - It's Doug. Guys, guys. Hello? Winston, my boy. How is everything goin' there? Everything's fine here, Doug. No issues with the security system or the hot tub? - Nope, shipshape. Say, I haven't heard from Joe since last night. Have you? - Can't say that I have. He hasn't been there since last night. - Nope. I see. You sure everything's all right? - Yup. Well if you see him, you tell him to call me as soon as possible. - You got it. Doug knows somethin's wrong. If anyone took the gun and if you have anything else to say, now's the time. Okay, everyone go get their luggage. We're gonna see who has the gun. We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now. Somebody's got the gun. We're gonna go around, we're gonna open our suitcases and we're gonna find out who's got somethin' to hide, okay? I'll go first. Okay, all right. See? Nothin'. Jules, she's got nothin'. Okay, all right. Tyler. - Yeah I mean, pretty much the standard Tyler experience. Some antidepressants for ya, my journal, some clothes. - Is this a picture of you and Abby from our wedding? - That's mine. - You ripped us out. - That's the only picture I have with her, and yeah. - That's so weird. - It's not weird. I think everyone knows I kinda have feelings for her, okay? All right okay, Nate. - This is screwed, you know? You guys know I didn't do anything. Just do it or I'll do it. - I'm doing it. I got the Molly from last night. Very nice. - Some weed. - Good. - Some other stuff. - Yeah. Some cocaine. - It's nice to see that the court-mandated rehab is going so well for someone. - You know what? It's a party and I wanna let loose, okay? - Good, very good. All right, it doesn't matter. The noble drug dealer. - All right, Joe. - It's the classic. - No luggage. - Yeah, I'll just be transparent here. You know, I just got kinda some basic stuff in here. There's a phone, you know? I got a baseball card I laminate for good luck. - That's fine. - I got my wallet. Guys, I'm clean. You guys are my friends. That's a penny. - Okay thanks, Joe. Well that leaves you, Margot. - You can't be serious. - I'm dead serious. We all know you been hidin' in that room. - Seriously, dude? - You're doing God-knows-what. You're the most suspicious one here. - Doing God-knows-what. What are you doing screaming outside at four in the morning? Come on. Open the suitcase like we all just did if you have nothing to hide. - Fine, fine. Do you want me to open the suitcase? Yes. - I'm gonna open the suitcase for ya. Here you go. Happy fuckin' day. Holy shit. - I sell panties. Are you fuckin' happy now? Look, I see you judging me, okay? I lost my fucking job. I had to sell my car to make rent. That ran out pretty quick. So I ran into this girl who said she did this kinda shit and it seems easy enough. Look if you don't believe me, ask Tyler. He knew. What? - Well, yes. She asked me not to tell anyone. It's a very nuanced and complex area of feminism that. I knew, yeah. - So what, you do porn? - No, I'm not doing porn. I sell used panties. Look, one pair can get me like 50 bucks. If I take a picture, I can get one to $200. - That's the story that you want us to believe? Look. Exactly. - Okay, so I guess this guy paid for your Uber. - So people just pay you for panties? - Yeah. I can sell panties, socks. God, if I write a guy's name on my arm, couple hundred at least. Okay, so if we're gonna go through my phone, I get to go through all of yours. Let's start with you, Winston. Wanna show me your phone? - That's fine, I don't give a shit. I don't have anything to hide. - Perfect. "To Tyler," and I quote. "Yeah, I know Nate's a douchebag, "but just bear with me for the night." Wow. I'm a douche? - I'm just tellin' him what he wants to hear. Cool. - No, I didn't mean. - No, no, thank you. I appreciate that. Whatever, on to the next. Julia? - This is so dumb. Okay? Nothing to hide. - Lemme see that. That's not nothing, Julia. You have about 10 missed calls from Mitch and several text messages too. What the fuck is that? - Who cares? - Who cares? You have a voicemail also. Let's see what that's about. Seriously fuck you, Julia. This is the same fuckin' bullshit every time you two hang out. She's not answering my calls. She won't text me back. I check your fucking Instagram and there's some picture with her with some random guy in a fucking hot tub. Tell Abby to call me right fucking now. Fuckin' bitch. I could play that again if anyone wants to hear it again. Yeah. - What picture is he talkin' about, hun? Okay, this is the picture that he is talking about. This is the one that she posted. Her engaged best friend in a hot tub with her drug dealing brother with the rest of the gang conveniently cropped out. Maybe that's the picture that he's talkin' about. - Okay Tyler, yes. Yes, yes, I posted the picture, okay? Yes, I cropped everyone else out. I was trying to break them up and I was trying to set you guys up. She was in a horrible relationship. I was just helping her, okay? That doesn't prove anything. Gimme my fucking phone back. - You guys are welcome to my phone. - Yeah, here. You assholes can look at my phone. I don't give a shit. All right Joe, I guess your phone. - You guys don't need to see my phone. I mean I just came over to help out and we ended up just hangin' out, so there's no reason to see my phone. - Here, buddy. I'll just take a little peek at it. - Okay. Yeah sure, of course. Thank you, babe. - No, no problem. - It's just a bunch of texts from his dad. - "Guests are having a problem with the hot tub. "Can you go over and check it?" Is Doug your dad? - No. Doug's not my dad. Okay, he's my dad technically. But when he goes outta town, I don't even live inside the house anymore. He makes me go and live out in a tent and just kinda act as the groundskeeper and help out. And normally that is all I would do, I would just come in and I would fix the hot tub. But somethin' happened and you guys were nice to me. Even the ones of you who didn't like me, at least you put up with me and I've never had that before. I have no friends. I've never had any friends. There's people here are like 70 years old. And all of a sudden I'm having fun with you guys and I don't know, it just got easier and easier to pretend that I was you know, just one of you and we're all hanging out. And I'm sorry that I did it. I feel bad for lying, I really do. But I don't feel bad for hanging out because honestly, I don't think I've had this much fun in my life ever and it feels crazy that we've known each other for less than a couple days and I don't think I have any friends that are better than you guys. - So you been lying to us this whole time. - Basically, yes. - Okay, you know what? You can tell it to the Community Task Force. - Community Task Force? What are you talking about? - The Neighborhood Watch guys. - What are you talking about? There's no Community Task Force. Yeah, then who are these guys? - These guys? No, they're locals. They dress up like cops to scare you when you come into town. They're tryin' to keep you from staying here anymore. - The phone line's dead. - What? Smart scorpions out here that are just snip, snippin'. - That's kinda weird. - Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. - What is this? - It's like a phone line. Accidents happen. - Accidents? This is a clean cut. That's some shady business. My gosh, what is this? This is an aux cable, dude. This is for like... Hey Joe, what is this aux for? Joe? Joe. - Honestly Julia, I think you're bored and you're sad. So really I have nothin' to hide. Are you serious? I'm bored and sad? - Yeah. My mediocre life? - Hey, guys. Guys. Hey, guys. Someone cut the phone line outside. - What? - Yeah and Joe's disappeared. Yeah, so check it out. I come out here. Phone line, cut. Look at this. A separate cord kinda coming out. I point that out to Joe and he takes off. - Well where is he? - I don't know, man. I can't find him. I'm freakin' out, man. You know? Something is not right. - We should've just called the cops when I said I wanted to call the cops. Hey, I found Joe's tent. You see it? - Yup. We should go check it out. - What's happening? - We found Joe's tent. Why don't we go look? You guys stay here. You're not going out there. - We gotta check it out. It'll be fine. I'll be right back. - I'll be fine, all right? - My god. I don't need to be here. Yup, you know, I shouldn't have come. Definitely should not have come. They'll be fine. - Are you getting anything? - Nothing. - This is so weird. My god. My god. Holy shit. My gosh. Holy shit. You son of a bitch. What're you doing? - This is a camera. This whole place has cameras. He's been watching this whole thing. - What? Joe, Joe. Holy shit. - Guys, guys. - Hey. - Look what we found in Joe's tent. - What is that, a gun? - Fuckin' gun. Yeah, we gotta call the cops now. - Look what I found. - So what? You don't understand. The gun was in Joe's tent. End of story. We gotta call the cops. - Okay, man. But look, this is a camera, right? I found a bunch of 'em. And this one was pointed at the pool where I found Abby's phone. So if we can find the tape, we can find out what happened to Abby. - Well we've been all over the house all day. Where would that be? Is there any room we haven't looked in? - Here it is, but it's locked. Doug took the key. - You know what? Fuck this. Nate, what're you doing? Jesus Christ. - Open. - Holy shit. What the actual fuck? - Who's that? - Look at this. He's got records of other people that stayed here. This one's still recording, look. Hold on, let's see if we can play it. Whoa. - So here's Nate finding the footage. Lemme see if I can rewind this thing. Okay, in my fucking room? - Jesus Christ. - God. - He has a camera in the bathroom? - That's disgusting. - What does he want that for? There's Joe with the gun. - I fuckin' knew it. - Man. - There's something off about him, man. And there's Abby. Winston, what? You said that you didn't see her. - I didn't. - Well you did though. - I fucking knew it. - What? - I knew I heard you screaming out there at four in the fucking morning, dude. Denying it this entire fucking time! - Hang on, I'm obviously blacked out there. That doesn't mean anything. - What, she wasn't invited to the party and ruin your little birthday bash? Is that what you do? - Are you kidding me right now? - I wouldn't fuckin' do anything. Jules, tell them. - Hey, man. What're you doing? - I don't know what to say. - What, you of all people, why are you out there? Why? I blacked out. I wouldn't hurt Abby. - You of all people. I stood up for you! - Okay, all right. - Just calm down. Who calls the cop when, you try and turn this shit on me? No, dude. - Are you all fucking crazy right now? I didn't do anything. Are you serious right now? - Are you? - Yeah. - Get the fuck away from me, Nate. Or what, motherfucker? - She got in the car. - Bullshit. - Stop. Get the fuck away from me. - Or what? - Calm down. - Or what, motherfucker? Goddammit! - The fuck just happened? - Power failure. - Power's out. - You fucking hit Nate. You fuckin' hit me, man! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Jesus Christ! - Power failure. - My god! What's going on? Winston fucking attacked Nate. - Fucking hit me right in the head, dude. - My god. - My god. Fuck. I think he's really hurt, you guys. Fuck. Isn't there any light? Yeah, I think Joe has a lantern back in the tent. - Hold on, hold on. - My god. Shit. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Is he all right? - My god. He's really hurt, you guys. - No no no no. - Okay guys, I know I don't wanna fuckin' admit this, but I think it's pretty obvious that Winston did something to Abby. - Okay Margot, slow down. You know, we didn't see all the tape. We're not 100% sure he did it. - Can we just figure out something to do please? I think it's really bad. - Okay yeah, yeah. Julia, don't you have a first aid kit in the car? - Yes. Yeah, I do. Okay, why don't you go get that? Okay, easy. Easy, easy, pal. What the fuck? - Just follow it. You got a concussion, man. - You guys, the car's missing. What? - Are you fuckin' kidding me? I don't know, somebody must've stolen it. What do you mean someone stole the car? - Okay, guys seriously. - It's missing! - We need to go into town. - How are we gonna go into town, Margot? It's 10 fucking miles. - You think he can walk? There's no other choice at this point. - Yeah, yeah. - Can you get up? - I think so, yeah. All right, well let's get him up then. - Okay, yup. - Okay. - Lean on me. - All right. - Come on. Careful, careful. - My god. - Holy shit. - We got your friend. You better pack up and get out. - Holy shit. - What the fuck? - My god. - Fuck these guys. - No, no, no. Nate, Nate, Nate, Nate. - Nate, stop. - Nate, get back. - Nate. - Okay. - Go, we need to go. - Let's get him back on the couch. Get him down. - I knew it, man. That's like meth gangs, dudes. - Stop. They have Winston, you guys. - We can't go out there. They might fuckin' kill us. - Well if we stay in here, they're gonna kill Winston. - Okay, well what do you wanna do? - I don't know. - You wanna sacrifice the whole fuckin'... - Everybody shut the fuck up! I did not come out here in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere to get attacked by some inbred hicks. There's two of them and there's four of us. Everybody grab a goddamn weapon. If they want a fight, I'm gonna give 'em a fight. - Dude, this is so badass. My god. - My god, they have guns? - They have guns. My god, my god. Hey hey hey. The guns are fake. Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop, stop. - Fuck you guys! - He's okay, he's okay. - My god, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? - He's fine, he's fine. Seriously, he's fine. He's okay. - Are you guys out of your fucking mind? - We can explain. Some of the locals didn't like the whole home-sharing tourism thing. Thought you guys were ruining like their retirement community and stuff. - Some of the locals? - Our parents. We really didn't wanna hurt you guys. It was really just supposed to be a goof. We just wanted to prank you guys and make sure you guys never wanted to back here. - You guys have been doing this this whole weekend, the gunshots? - Spying on us in the bushes? - Cutting the phone line? - Taking our car? - Hey now, we didn't steal the car. We only took the spark plug. Spark plug. I knew it was somethin'. - Hey assholes, why is my car missing? - Shoot, that must've been Tony. He must've came by. - Is Joe in on this with you? - No, not Joe. He hates our guts. - Yeah, fuck Joe. - Where is our friend? Where's Abby? - We have nothing to do with Abby. Ours is all fun and games. It was supposed to be one big joke, okay? - A lotta fuckin' fun everyone's having. - Gimme your phone, I'm callin' the cops. - Buddy, no. Don't call the sheriff please. We had a thing goin' on, right buddy? If you can't do it. Remember us? C'mon, please. My god, my god. - My god, is that my blunderbuss? My tomahawk. My luger. Hans Goebeler could've touched that. Put that down right now. - Hey, we thought your little golf buddies were gonna kill us. They been fuckin' with us all weekend. - Doug seriously, it's not how it looks. Please, man. - Goddammit. Brent, Chip, I told your parents that I would shoot you on the spot if I saw you on my property again. - It's not the way it looks, man. It was a goof. We were just messin' around. We were just prankin' 'em, please. - This is not the way it was supposed to go. You put a bag over my head and pointed a gun at me. It was the air pistol. - So help me God, you're goin' to Chino if I have anything to say about it. You, you treated my beautiful home like a frat house. You're goin' to jail too. You're all goin' behind bars. - We didn't do anything illegal for the most part. - You deliberately violated section six, article three of the signed terms and conditions. Joe, get me my dossier. - Are you fuckin' kidding me? - You only know that because you put some kinda surveillance system. - It's a security system. - You record and then you keep the files. - I delete them when the guests leave. - You have 2 1/2 years worth of footage, bro. - It's my right as an American. So you just record people showering and then watch it? What kind of a pervert are you? No offense. - Not what I do. - Then you get your son to come over and what, pretend like he's a repairman to fix a jacuzzi? I mean, what's the angle on that one? - I mean if it means anything, I had a really nice time, guys. - Okay, well if you had such a nice time Joe, why'd you steal the gun in the middle of the night? - Allegedly. - You touched the pistol? - Dad. - Look, we've talked about this 1,000 times, Joe. That is not a toy. It is not a prop. It is not a video game. It is not something to show the girls. It's not something to touch yourself with. - Well when do I get to touch it? You know, you keep it locked up like it's some kind of Vatican treasure and then people check in and you wave it around and you let them touch it. Everyone gets to touch it, but not old Joe. Well when is it gonna be goddamn time for Joe to touch it? - Hello? Julia. Thank, god. I've been trying to get in touch with you all day, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. We're okay, are you okay? Yeah. Winston told me about what Tyler did. God, Jules. I just felt so horrible. I couldn't be there when you guys woke up. I ran back in town and called Mitch and he came and got me. I'm so sorry to do that to you. Is everything okay? - Yup, yeah, all good. Well, I'm gonna get back to Mitch. But let's chat when you guys get back, all right? - Okay. - Have fun. - Yup. - Who was it? - That was Abby. - What? Is she okay? - Yeah, she ran into town and she's with Mitch. She's okay. Shut up! There's an easy solution. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. How was your daughter's soccer game? - I don't have a daughter. Yup. Well good news: I don't have concussion. Bad news: they wouldn't give me drugs. You know, on account of the rehab. My head hurts.
