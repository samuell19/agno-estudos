A steadfast and valued friend... and selfless example to her children. Stricken by chronic ill health... her courage and faith in the Lord Jesus sustained her... in the long twilight of her life. May the Lord grant... Josephina Amalia Teresa Thompson... eternal rest. Can't get any more in the boot, Pam. Put it on the back seat. Plenty of room there. Don't want this, do you? Or this thing? You don't want that, do you? Go ahead. Take what you want. We should share these things. Anything you particularly need, you tell me. I don't want to take anything you're desperately attached to. I'm only taking all this to get it out of your way. Do you want to live here... clattering around a house full of Mum's old stuff? That's up to you. I thought-- As long as you leave the piano. You really would be much better off... in a nice, little modern flat somewhere. Or you could come live with us for awhile. A very nice young widow lives near us now. Number 28. I told you about her. She's well run in, Pete. Vintage. Don't be an animal, Bruce. I don't want to sell this place. You can't stay here indefinitely. It's not healthy. And you're nearly 50, you know. You could do something with your life. I'm sorry. I don't mean that to sound awful... but you've been cooped up here for too long. If you're not careful, it'll be too late. You got to start living your own life. Mr. Thompson, nobody's touched the piano... since my husband's died. It's come up well. It's in good nick for its age. Maybe I shouldn't sell it after all. I wouldn't if I were you. It's worth twice what you'd get for it. Bye-bye, blackbird That's lovely. My husband never played anything modern. How much do I owe you? $50, Mrs. Murray. With a $10 discount for cash if you can sing... "Bye-bye, Blackbird" through without a mistake. The two of us? You drive a hard bargain. OK, you're on. Pack up all my cares and woe Here I go, singing low Bye-bye-- Come on, Meryl. Where somebody waits for me Come on, Meryl. Bye-bye, blackbird No one here can love or understand me Oh, what hard luck stories They all hand me Make my bed and light the light I'll arrive late tonight Blackbird, bye-bye Mr. Thompson? Mr. Thompson, this is Sally Gordon... from the Excelsior Introduction Service. We have a contact that might interest you. Could you please call the office... and make an appointment? Thank you. Peter, darling, this is Dorothy. We haven't seen you since you lost your mum. Just want you to know we haven't forgotten you. We're playing bingo this Friday. You've got to come. Bye. Hey, Peter, what are you doing... with one of these silly machines? Listen, I'm doing a new play. I've got just the part for you. Need someone who's strong, brilliantly talented... and prepared to get me out of the shit. Just the part for you. See you Wednesday night at the theater. Ciao. What's the matter with you, Dig? Come on, Dig. That's a boy, Come on, Dig. Take it easy, Pete. So sorry to hear about your mother, Peter. Thanks, Mrs. Morgan. Poor old thing. You never know when it's coming, do you? All you can do is just look after yourself. You can't do much more than that. Well, good-bye. Nice fellow. He was very close to his mother. He'll miss her a lot. Pity he can't get a job. Mr. Thompson. Would you come in now, Mr. Thompson? Sure. Fine. Please sit down. Before we discuss the lady in question... I hope you don't mind if I take a few more details. May seem clinical, but it really does help us. Sure. Fine. Have you ever used a service like this before? No, I haven't. You said you were advanced in age. Do you mind telling me how advanced? Very, really. I'll be 50 in a couple of weeks. Not looking forward to it a great deal. I'm 49 now. Well, I wouldn't worry. Have you been married? Oh, no, no. Sally? Excuse me a moment. Have you got a file on Patricia Curnow? I've got a client. Sorry, Martin. I'm just about... to introduce her to Mr. Thompson here. And the more I get to know him... the more I think that-- Very impressive, wasn't she? We don't get many of those. Let us know how you get on, Mr. Thompson. See you. What do you think? Good looking, isn't she? We find it best not to disclose a clients' background. It lets the relationship develop more naturally... and protects them if anything goes wrong. You don't think she's a bit young for me? Not at all, Mr. Thompson. She's the type who needs a mature man. One who's lived a little. I feel very confident about your chances. I've got nothing to lose. You have everything to gain, Mr. Thompson. Believe me, I see it happening every day. Now, phone number. She'll be expecting your call. Sorry. Is there anything else you'd like to know? No, nothing. Right, the fee. Oh, yes. The $50. It's a $50 consultancy fee... plus $50 membership fee when we give you a contact. - So it's 100? - Yes. The $50 consultancy fee plus this other $50? For the membership. Making a total of 100. You don't have to go ahead with the membership. There are plenty of clients in your age group... who'd like to meet Patricia. Hello? Hello. Am I talking to Patricia Curnow? Now, what can we do for you, sir? This fellow here's the trouble, is it? I'm really quite happy with it... but the lace in the front is a bit frayed. Had it awhile, have we? I must say, it doesn't match at all well. It isn't often we see them this bad. What we say is that a bad tonsorial match... is worse than none at all. I didn't think it was that bad. You might patch it up a bit. It's up to you, sir. If you're happy to have people see you like this... we can certainly try to hold it together... for a little while longer. Have you got a hat? I thought you might do it now. I can't wear a hat all the time. Look, just let me show you something. Tell me if you don't like it. My goodness, yes. Now let's see what a proper appliance can do. Beautiful craftsmanship in this. We have them in from Hong Kong. We don't get many. You cannot get them. Best you can buy, this model. Exquisite, isn't it? How much is it? Let me tell you something. I really shouldn't be telling you this... because it's trade talk, but this one... is particularly popular with the ladies. Peter Thompson? Patricia. Shall we go somewhere and have a drink? Yes, if you like. What would you like to drink? Small orange juice, please. A small orange juice and a beer, thanks. I read about this place in the paper. Thought it might be a good spot to meet. It's very impressive. Is this convenient for you? I suppose I should have checked. No, it's quite handy for me, actually. I just work a couple of streets away. At a bank, is it? Yes, it's quite close. Is it in this street? Yes, it's down the road. Thank you. Couple of blocks. It's not far at all. That's good. A couple of blocks, is it? Is it a big yellow building? I think it's brown. Although it could be yellow. There's a yellow building down there somewhere. I always thought it was a bank. Maybe I'm wrong. You're probably right. I never notice things like that. What bank is it? It's the Commonwealth. I knew a bloke who worked for them. Nice bloke. I think he was an accountant. Did he work for one of the branches? Oh, no. He left a few years ago. He's in Canada now. Jim...somebody. I forget his name. No, I wouldn't know him. We're getting somewhere now. Drinks at the Wentworth Hotel... two days later, lunch at the Flying Dutchman. And now the boy's hit the jackpot. Dinner for two at her place. Don't wait up. If you want something to eat... there's a ton of stuff in the fridge. If anyone rings... just give your name and registration number. What sort of music do you like to listen to? I haven't got much. It's mostly classical. Anything. I don't mind. Oh, my God. The garlic bread. I forgot all about it. It's burnt. It's good a bit crisp. It isn't crisp, it's burnt. Did you decide on what sort of music? No, I didn't. I don't mind, really. Don't know what this is. Haydn quartets. Is this you when you were a kid? Not a very good one. - Oh, dear. - It's all right. These are the ones I use for tuning. I forgot to bring my good ones. Can you see all right without them? Pardon? Where are you? Tell me... what exactly does a piano tuner do? He tunes pianos, basically. He gets ahold of pianos... - Out of tune pianos. - Ideally, yes. Pianos that are not as tuneful as they should be. - And you tune them. - More or less. This is rather nice. It's something I've had for ages. There's no proper cover for it. Did you ever learn music? Only at school. Did you? What sort? Piano. Were you any good? No, not really. I always thought I'd take it up again later. You should. I'll keep an eye out for a nice little piano for you. I've got a piano. Dad insisted I take it. Where is it? It's in there. I'll have a look at it for you if you like. It's ready. Would you do the wine for me, please? Best meal I've had for ages. Except for the burnt bread. Especially for the crisp bread. More music? No, let's have a look at your piano. That's an old one. What you need here is a piano tuner. Play some more. No, I can't play. Why don't you play something? I can't play. You've got lovely hands. I suppose I better be going. Can I give you a hand? No, thanks. I'll do it. Thanks for a lovely evening. Beautiful dinner. Can I give you a ring? Yes, if you want to. I will if you want me to. That would be nice if you want to. I might do that, then. OK, I will. I'll call you during the week. Good night. You say he's much older than you are. He's not exactly an old man. Oh, no, no. And he hasn't been married? I don't think so. I don't know. I hardly know him, really. You say he's gentle. You've been spending a lot of time together? He obviously likes you very much. And do you like him? Yes, I do. So there's still just one thing that's worrying you. Patricia, there is nothing the matter... with sexual inexperience. It's quite normal. Quite natural. Everyone goes through it. You're not as worried about it as you were, are you? Stay there, Dig. It's a little dark in here. I'll switch the light on. It's all right, Mrs. Eddy. Where's the piano? Over here. Thank you. Is this the music, is it? What have we here? A pot plant. Can you put that somewhere? Thank you. Now, could you lean that against something? Thanks very much. Ah, it's one of these. I'll leave you to it, Mr. Thompson. Thanks, Mrs. Eddy. You'll call me if you need anything, won't you? I will, certainly. Just a moment, and I'll give you a hand. No, I'm all right. Now come along. Are we near the gate? Not yet. Now, be careful. No, I'm all right. Are you sure you're all right? No, I'm fine, thanks. Bye. Patricia, it's Peter here. Hello, Peter. Would you like to go out somewhere? Where to? I'm pretty busy this evening. To bingo. It's great. You'll love it. That sounds like fun. I've never been to anything like that. Good. So you'll come? Fine. As long as I'm back at a reasonable hour. Clickety clicks...66. All the fours...44. Lovely legs...11. How are you doing, Pete? Two to go. Voting time...18. Two little bees...33. Fifteen. One five. Churchill's den... Number 10. Bingo! Bit of a dark horse, the old Pete. Never seen him with a woman before in me life. And suddenly he turns up with a deluxe model. - You reckon? - Certainly. Been hiding it under a bush, have you, Pete? The boys are very impressed. Wasn't much of a night tonight. We should have come on a club night. Club nights are best. I enjoyed it. Thank you. I won't ask you in. I'm going straight to bed. Thanks again. Good night. Good night. What about the theater? You coming? Will you ring me? Good night, Peter. "Patricia... "of the nobility, well-born... "feminine of Patrick... "Pat... "Patsy, Patty, Tricia." Tricia. "Trish." Excuse me. You do deal with travellers cheques? Yes, we do. Good. I want this right here. Just sit around and watch TV, I suppose. No, I'm not that tired. I just don't want to go out. Yes, of course I've got clothes on. How's your pricky? Is he? Poor old fella. He was looking real well when I last saw him. Yes, I'll have to check that for you, sir. Will he be OK for tonight? That's good. I bought a present for him. No, it's a secret. Love it. If you don't mind eating the same thing... two nights in a row. What are you doing here? Now, perhaps you'll tell me what's going on. Nothing's going on. Something must be going on. You're never home. What do mean, I'm never home? What are you doing to the flat? Nothing much. I just went out for the evening. But you said you'd ring. Well, I couldn't. But you always ring. I was gonna ring tomorrow. Your mother was worried sick. I suppose you realize that. There's nothing to worry about. I'm perfectly all right. That's not the point. Will you please look at me while I'm speaking to you? I simply went out for the evening. Of course. That's your business. We don't want to pry. Never have. Where'd you go? I went to the bingo. Bingo? For God's sake. What on earth for? Can't I go out when I want to? Do I have to get permission to go out after work? Listen, dear, nothing we'd love more... than to see you happy. You know that. But the point is, you said you'd ring. When you love anybody as much as we love you... it's very worrying not to know where you are. Not much to ask, is it? Good. Did you have a good time? Happy? "Are you sure? "Do you think a man can live... "when he has nothing and no one to live for?" "Then you capitulate." "No. I propose an armistice." "And your conditions?" "Free me from..." My dear boy... thank heavens you've made it. Those two should be shot. You must be Patricia. Peter talks about you constantly. You look fantastic. This works beautifully. Keep it in. It's just the face I've been looking for. Can you act? Of course. You'll be brilliant. No, no, please... I couldn't possibly go on a stage. I've never done anything like that in my life. Betty. Betty, do let's be sensible, dear. Let's not scream the bloody roof off. Your husband's about to die in a minute. You'll have the poor old bugger jumping out of a birthday cake. Pull it back a bit, for Christ's sake. And see if you can do it without spitting. I know a lot of Swedes... and they tend to be very refined. Peter, tell Patricia about George. Tell Patricia how long George has been a director... how many successes he's had... how he's a fantastic judge of women... and how he'll kill himself if she doesn't do the part. Listen to Peter, darling. He's got wisdom beyond his years. Take a break, you two. Peter has more... more personality than you, darling. You play the doctor, Ron. I'm glad Betty's pissed off. This Patricia's a jewel. "Perhaps I'm disturbing you." Beautiful. "Not at all." "The housekeeping money, I suppose." "Yes. The housekeeping money." Absolutely fantastic. "Leave the bills there, and I'll go through them." "Oh, you want bills now?" Superb. "Of course I want bills. "We are financially embarrassed... "and if things come to a head... "I've got to be able to produce accounts. "Otherwise, I can be punished as a negligent debtor." "It isn't my fault if you're financially embarrassed." Absolutely brilliant, Patricia darling. Betty couldn't have done it in a million years. Let's try from the top of page 51. Why Strindberg, George? Patricia, downstage. And after she says "You are the father." Just go from there. Alan, keep it down to a dull roar. Why choose Strindberg at all? Why something we can't possibly do properly? Are you ready, Peter? Mother Superior's birthday again? Yes, tomorrow. The sisters won't disturb you, will they? They'll only be here a few minutes. - Not at all. - I'll leave you to it. You can book us in for the same time next year. Certainly, Sister. Don't put the flowers there, Sister Agatha. The afternoon sun will ruin them. I'll leave you to it, Mr. Thompson. Good-bye. Good-bye, Sister. Peter... Peter, it's Patricia here. I just wanted to say thank you... for the flower you left at work. It was really sweet of you. Do you really think I'll be any good in the play? It's all a bit embarrassing, isn't it? Anyway... please give me a call when you get home. Bye. Happy birthday, Peter. We're coming over for a celebration. We'll bring Joyce. She's a widowed lady. Number 28 I was telling you about. She's dying to meet you. See you around 8:00. Hello, Pam. Yes, I know. Look, there's a slight complication. No, I'll be here... but don't bring this woman around. Because I've already invited someone. I can't put her off. I've invited her. No, I can't. Just you and Bruce, OK? No one else, right? Gravy's good, Pete. Just like your mum used to make. It's made with wine instead of water. Mine's exactly the same. When they've been married for a few years... all they can say about your food is... "When's it going to be ready?" That's my experience, anyhow. Have you ever been married? Peter hasn't told us the first thing about you. Don't rush into it, dear. We were engaged for... five years, weren't we? Eight. My glass, dear. How long have you known Peter? Pam, come on. Well, where'd you meet? We were in the same outfit during the war. I'm only asking. How much money did you make last year, Bruce? None of your business. I'm only asking. What is black and white and red all over? Bruce, you've got gravy on your tie. Oh, shit. Don't rub it in. Be sensible. Use some water. How can you stand the smell of that dog? Smells like an old man. Something wrong with his diet, I think. I'd cut out the beans if I were you. I'm taking him to the vet tomorrow, anyway. George Irvine wants you in his new play. Not on your life. He's not making a fool of himself again. He can't act. Of course he can. It's only amateur theater. We're both in it. Good part, Bruce. What is it, Pete? A Swedish pastor. I'm warning you, Bruce. You start that again-- Come on. You enjoyed it the last time. Bruce did a wonderful job. He's very funny. Funny? Out three nights a week... drunk all the rest of the time... because he gets too nervous, so he says. Maybe I should make some coffee. You could give me a hand. No, no, no! The surprise first. Come on, Bruce. What do you need me for? Come and help me. Do as I say. Is that your only sister? Yes, thanks very much. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday To you Happy birthday, dear Peter Happy birthday To you What's the trouble? - Off its food. - Is it? Hasn't eaten since Tuesday. Oh, dear. Tried everything. - How old? - Seven. You feel so helpless, don't you? They're almost human. Mr. Thompson? Hello, Digger, how are you today? Mrs. Hurley, Peter. The old folks are having a birthday party on Saturday. Could you please come and play? Thank you, Peter. Peter, you're never home. Have you seen Bruce? Calm down, Dig. The vet told you to take it easy. I want you to ring me as soon as you get home. Practicing your accent, I see. Yes, I'm studying. Are you still involved in this theater thing? - That's right. - What is it? It's a play by August Strindberg. Is this friend of yours in it? Yes, he is. What's his name again? A nice fellow? - Strindberg or Peter? - Peter, of course. Yes, he is. He's a very nice individual. But you're not interested in the theater. Daddy, I've always been interested in the theater. You don't know the first thing about it. I do know the first thing about it. As a matter of fact... the director thinks I'm very good. What would he know about it? He knows a lot about it. He's the director. Are you sure it's a good idea? Listen, Daddy, please-- I don't think you ought to go-- I'm going to do it! "Every time your feelings towards me changed... "and you approached me as my lover, I felt bashful. "And every time your feelings towards me changed... "and you approached me like a lover--as my lover... "I felt bashful." The whole night through Winged doves play, hear them say Love me, too Now, the echo answers Say you love me true All the world's in love with love And I love you What do you want? Come on, tell me. Play something like "Knees Up Mother Brown." "Knees Up Mother Brown"? I'll see what I can do. Knees up Mother Brown Under the table you must go If I catch you bending I'll saw your legs right off Knees up, knees up Don't get the breeze up Knees up Mother Brown Knees up Mother Brown Under the table you must go If I catch you bending I'll saw your legs right off Knees up, knees up Don't get the breeze up Knees up Mother Brown Before we go on... I want to let you all in to a little secret. Our Peter, who's always been... so willing to come and play for us... has just turned 50. For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us And so say all of us, and so say all of us For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us Peter, where have you been? I've been trying to call you. Sorry. I just had to dash out. I thought you were taking me out today. I am. I'll be there in about ten minutes. I'll wait then. When did your mother die? Eight weeks ago. About 5:00 one Sunday afternoon. Happened in her sleep. Never woke up. And your father? He's lived in a home for the past ten years. He's in good company. There's three Napoleons, seven Lord Nelsons... and Joseph Stalin's uncle. I love those ducks. It's such a beautiful green, isn't it? What's he doing? He's drowning the poor little thing. What a bully. Your parents still alive? Dad's retired now. Doesn't know what to do with himself. He's a sweetheart, really. Big family? No, just the three of us. I only left home recently. They can't get used to the idea. You must be very close. We are. They've been very good to me. I was always terribly spoiled. Yes, I... I owe them a lot, really, I suppose. I love Melbourne in winter. It really is beautiful. Sit in the corner. I'll take your picture. What? No, Peter. I look awful. Don't. I haven't got the hang of this yet. Be ready in a minute. What time's the concert? It starts at 8:00. I'd better go home soon. I want to have a shower. You can shower at my place if you like. Oh, no. I'll go home, thanks. You should have heard Pam when she saw my Polaroid. You can't take that. What are you doing? You're wasting your time. Throwing Mum's money down the drain. Poor old Mum. I think she would have been quite pleased. I'm still cold. Could you hold my bag while I do my coat up? I'll do it for you. Will you? The top button. That's better. Warm? How's it going, Pete? Pretty well. Thanks, Bruce. The dog's crook... the gas people reckon I owe them money... back to the middle of last year. The home's having problems with Dad. George wants me to memorize everything Strindberg wrote. Generally speaking, things couldn't be better. - Mind if I say something? - Go ahead. I don't think I can do the play. Why not? Not very good. Not very good in the play... or not good at persuading Pam? Both, really. The part will be brilliant. I'll reckon you'll get an Oscar for it. Don't worry about Pam. She's always like that. Her heart's in the right place. Doesn't always work properly, but there's one in there. She'll get used to the idea. Look at Patricia. Never been on a stage in her life. That's true. She's good, isn't she? You've done pretty well for yourself there. Does she know about your wig? Does Pam know you pick your nose? Let's go. We're late. I can hear someone on the steps. Go to bed now. Margaret, can we do something about your costume? You look rather like a Christmas tree... and do something about your boobs, Kate. I can see them flapping from here. Let's try Act Two, Scene Two. Laura and the pastor. Patricia and Bruce. Patricia's behind the desk. Bruce comes hurrying in from the right. Will somebody answer the bloody phone? Not now, darling, I can't be farting around with posters. Lots of color and Strindberg's name... slightly smaller than mine. It'll be lovely, darling. Bruce, let's go. Where's Bruce? Sorry, George. Where'd you want me? If you think you've got the time... you might try coming in from there... and talking to Laura up there by the window. That's if you haven't got something better to do. Right. Quiet, everyone. Alan, you're part of everyone. - He wants me to hammer quietly. - Thank you, Alan. - Thank you, George. - Thank you, Bruce. Alan, who's responsible for this stupid light here? Which stupid light? This stupid light. - I am. - Well, turn it off. - It is off. - Thank you, Alan. Thank you, George. Thank you, Bruce. Good evening, sister. Come right on inside. You can't just appear in a puff of smoke. You have to walk onstage, from stage right... where I told you before. George, it's all nerves with Bruce. He's under pressure about being in the play. He'll get it if you leave him alone. Good evening, sister. I've been away all day so I couldn't come before. Well, this is a sad story. Relax, Bruce. Relax. Hurrying doesn't mean running... and if it's a sad story, why are you smiling? Take it from the top. You're on my handbag. I need a fag. Bertha, be a sweetheart and get me a cup of coffee. All right. Thanks, Bruce. Good evening, sister. I've been away all day. Away with the fairies. I couldn't come before. Well, this is a sad story. Yes, brother. It's the worst 24 hours I've ever experienced. Bruce isn't exactly breathing life into this. How did it all begin? I've heard so many versions. Will you pay attention? Have you and Patricia worked on your big scene? Haven't had time. We'll have to skip it... but we should've been rehearsing for a week. Better get on to it. You just skipped a page and a half of dialogue. Not now, darling. How is anybody supposed to follow the plot... if you go jumping about like that? None of you know your lines. Not one of you. It's bloody ludicrous. Three weeks to go, and we're not even close. Go home, all of you, and learn your lines. Can I see you, Tricia? You were terrific, darling. Maybe we could improve your presence a little bit... but practice, darling, in front of a mirror. All great actors do it. I even do it myself. Can we get together and go through this? That would be good. Tomorrow night? Yeah, sure. Right. God knows I've done my best to meet his wishes... during all these long years of trial. Oh, if you knew what I've had to put up with. If you knew-- Are your parents coming to see the play? Oh, God, no. My father hates anything to do with the theater. He'd collapse if he saw me on the stage. Thank you. I love good red wine. To the play. - To the play. - Good luck. Peter, I wish you'd destroy that photo. I look awful. You look beautiful. You know, I... I don't think Strindberg knew anything about women. Why are you reading this? It's interesting. It's his diary. I think Strindberg was a typical male chauvinist. Then you should read this. Here we go. "Life is so horribly ugly. "We human beings are abysmally evil... "that if a writer were to describe... "all that he has seen and heard... "no one could bear to read it." What a lot of nonsense. "Reading and education seem to do no more... "than mask the beast in us... "and virtue is a disguise." That's awful. The man was obviously insane. Can't see Bruce coming up with it. Bruce gave me this, you know. Can I get you another drink? You trying to get me drunk? You don't want another one? Have you ever been drunk? Really drunk? Yes. It does you good to get drunk once in a while. I'll have some more, then, thanks. - You want to get drunk? - I'm not sure. If I get drunk... I wouldn't be able to drive home. That's true, and if I get drunk... I won't be able to drive you home. I don't want you to go home. Don't you? It's a great fire. I think I'd better go. Please stay. Can I trust you, Peter? Let's be adult about this. I think I'll have another drink. Do you know what I think? No, I don't. Well, I think... I think we should go to bed together... but not, you know... not do anything. Good. Fine. Comfortable? Digger, get out. I'll put him in the lounge room. Digger, where are you? Dig, where are you? Come out, you little bugger. You stay in here, Dig. Go to sleep. You're warm. I'm freezing. What...what are you doing? What are you--No. No. What are you... You said--you said-- I can't... What is it? Please. Patricia, don't go. I don't... This is ridiculous. Where the hell are they? Peter isn't home, and Patricia doesn't want to be in it. - Did you speak to her? - Slammed the phone down. What's her fucking number? The bitch. I knew it. What the hell is Peter doing? You're so big. I need you again. You put milk in it! I understand exactly what you're going through. You're both under a great deal of strain... but for heaven's sakes, we are professionals. Aren't we, Bruce? The show must go on. I'll have a good talk to Peter. Don't worry, love. You're far too talented to let it go to waste. Here, here. Do you want me to get that? No, I'll get it. Patricia? Hello, darling. Dad here. Hello, Dad. You're a great help. What's "Here, here" supposed to mean? I shouldn't talk to you. Hello, darling. I have some friends here. How are you, love? I've been so worried about you. Can I call you back? Are you looking after yourself? Please, listen to me. I think it's a good idea of Dad's... that we all get together soon and have dinner. It'll be nice to have a night out together. It's been a long time since we've seen you... Hello, Peter. It is Peter, isn't it? Hello, Dad. Where are my glasses? It's me, Dad. Lovely day, Peter. But watch it, Pete. The people here are no good. They've hidden the toilet. Be careful, Peter. Where's your sister? Pam couldn't make it today. What's Mum up to? There goes the tea bell. Dad, they want to put you in a hospital. Just for a few days. Will do you the world of good, Peter. Can I use your phone, please? Of course, Mr. Thompson. Hello, Pam. I'm with Dad. He's not the best. They want to send him to a hospital. About $50 a week extra. Look, he's sick! What am I supposed to do? I've spent most of my life looking after-- Shit. Forget it! Are you all right, Mr. Thompson? Yes, I'm fine. Peter, I'm so sorry. I feel so bad, not having seen Dad for so long. Is he serious? I looked after Mum, too. You know that, Peter... and you mustn't think that Bruce and I would... that we would evade our responsibilities. Come on. Let's go inside. I can understand how you feel about it... but is it reasonable to say you don't trust him? Surely you're both responsible for what happened. But I thought I could trust him. And you're disappointed? You think that is enough to reject him entirely? Yes. I don't want to see him again. What about the other things you shared? What about the play? You said you enjoyed it. Yes, but... I'm not going on with it. What about the concerts? They're all right. Aren't you letting one incident... spoil your whole relationship? He should've thought about that. I want you to get together and talk about it. There's nothing to talk about. Patricia Curnow, please. Peter, you can't ring me here. No, I can't. I don't want to. Yes. Well, thank you. Thank you for calling. Please don't hang up. Thank you, darling. - Bye. - Good day. Hey, there's two people... screwing in the back of me cab. What? People really do that? Bloody oath, they do. In the back of the cab? I happened to look in the mirror at one stage. Thought I was being followed... by two bald-headed blokes on a pogo stick. That's a bit public, isn't it? Happens all the time late at night. No one around. Can't blame 'em, I suppose. No, no. I suppose you can't. The old hormones. There's no stopping 'em sometimes. That's true. Married yourself? You'd know. Does wonders for your relationship. Well, yeah. It's obvious enough, isn't it? People just don't seem to realize. That's true enough. You can't beat a good bang. Fuckin' oath. Mr. Dimsey? Hi. I'm Rosemarie from "Call a Kitten." I didn't think you were home. Sorry, I was in the garden. Hang on. It's all right! Got the money? It's on the table. Right. What's your first name, Mr. Dimsey? Black Label, me favorite. How about pouring us a neat one? No ice and no water, thanks. Please. Cheers. That's better. Where's the bathroom? Through the door to the right. What an enormous home. Do you live here on your own, Pete? What you need's a good woman, sweetheart. What's your little dog's name? That's Digger. Hello, little Digger. Yes, sweet Dig. Hello, Diggsy. Peter, I've spoken with Patricia... and everything's fine. Please ring me immediately, you silly boy. Bye. Friend of yours, is he? Killing me. Now, I don't want you to worry, Pete. Just relax. Digger and me, we'll make you very happy. Aren't we, Diggsy? Gonna make daddy very happy. Do you want to go to your bedroom? Excuse me. I have to make a phone call. Do you want me to get it? No. I'll go. Oh, God. Good day, Pete. Aren't you ready yet? I thought I'd just drop around early... so we could have a bit of a chat. Jesus, am I busting for a leak. Bruce, this is... Rosemarie. Hello, Bruce. Good day, Rosemarie. All right, darlings, final scene. Top of page 76. Now--Where's Peter? You're on the sofa with Laura... wearing a straightjacket. Can we do something about these costumes? And, Bruce... Bruce, you and Ron... wait for Patricia's scream. And take it from the captain's speech there, right? There are five characters in this scene, not six. Thank you, Alan. Thank you, George. How will we sort anything out if you won't see me? Do you want to see your child, Adolf? Speak. Good. My child? A man has no children. Gentle Jesus, mild and meek... look upon this little-- Shit, Peter. Gentle Jesus, meek and mild! For Christ sake! We open in a fortnight. Why won't you see me? Listen. He's saying his prayers. All I want to do is talk to you. Are we gonna get your last line? I can't do this now. I got a headache. What's the matter, Pete? What's going on? Come down here and relax for a minute. Come on. Bertha and Margaret... we'll do your scene from Act Two. Margaret, can I sit with you a while? It's so horrid up there. Heaven be preserved. Are you still up? I daren't sit up there alone. I'm sure there are ghosts about. Mark my words... there's no good angel guarding this house! Can I give you a lift home? No, thanks. I've got my mother's car. Can I come and talk to you? What do you expect me to do? I love you. Well, I don't believe you. Would you just leave me alone? What are you doing? Where the bloody hell you going? Get stuffed! What about the cheese? Cheese? Yes. The cheese you took. I put it back. I decided I didn't want it. He said he put it back. You took a packet of cheese. Security saw you. No, I put it back. I decided I didn't want it. What else have you got? Show us what's in your pockets. You're not gonna search me. Is there a packet of ham, Elsie? You'd better come to the office with us. Give us a name and address. And your address. Ring the police, Jean. Please don't do that. I didn't know what I was doing. My wife's just left me. That's a familiar story, Mr. Curnow. You can explain it to the police. Sign there on the bottom, please, James. Cheese. 84 cents. Ham $1.18. That's $2.02. Not worth it, James, is it? Is this true? I'm afraid we'll have to trouble you... for a court appearance, James. Get a car, Jack, and run him home. It's not far. I can walk. It's no bother. Jack will take you. He loves traveling. I don't want to go home. Got more shopping to do. I don't think the shops could stand... another expedition, James. It's no bother to run you home. Want to ring a lawyer? You're in big trouble, James. Big trouble. You need a good lawyer. Is Mr. Marshall there, please? No, it's all right. I'll ring him tomorrow. Thanks. He's... out for lunch. Don't forget your goodies, Mr. Curnow. Thank you. What sort of dog have you got? A little Dachsie. Sausage dog. Christ. Thanks very much. The key's not there. I share the flat with a friend. We usually leave it out. She must have forgotten. Maybe she's inside. No. I don't think she'd be home. Let's have a look anyway. Patricia, I didn't ring-- What are you doing here? What's happening? This gentleman claims his name is James Curnow... living at Flat 3, number 25. Do you know this man? Yes, I do. Peter, what's going on? All right, Mr. Peter... we'll go back to the station and start again. Pamela? It's Patricia. Peter's just been here with the police. Whatever for? I don't know. He said he lived here. - Why'd he say that? - I've no idea. Where is he now, Pat? Well, they've taken him back. - Back where? - To the police station. - How did all this happen? - It's my fault. Your fault? How is it your fault? I can't explain. Oh, God, I'd better ring the police. Please, would you do that... and then ring me back? I'll call you back shortly. Thanks, Pamela. Bye. Come here. Come on, come here. Come on. You got the whole backyard to do that in. That's not good enough. You know it's not good enough, don't you? It's your first offence. We appreciate that. You won't go to jail. We'll just humiliate you... try to destroy you for a while until we get bored... then send you back to your pitiful bloody life. Is Mr. Marshall there, please? No, that's all right. I'll ring him tomorrow. They have to punish you, of course. Sorry, but I don't make the rules. George, my parents are at the door. I can't talk now. No, I'll call you back. Well! Can we come in? Yes, come in. Dreadful weather. How are you, darling? I'm fine. You don't look very well, dear. Are you all right? I'm fine! Don't I get a hug? Why don't you show your mother the flat? It's a lovely place, Patsy. How many rooms? It's quite small, but it's really cozy. It's the bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. Here. This is lovely! Bed's a bit big, isn't it? Could easily hold the three of us. What's this? What's in it? My contact lenses. Those things are very expensive, aren't they? You wouldn't be the same without your glasses, pet. Patsy... Are you still seeing those theater people? Please don't tell your dad. I've been so worried about you, pet. You'd better not mention it. You know what he's like. Shouldn't that rug be on the floor? It looks very odd there. Don't you worry about my poor throbbing finger. I've been pressing that doorbell for half an hour... but tradesman's entrance will do me. I bought you a lovely bottle of champagne. It's not French, but I'm sure it's lovely. I won't be doing the play. Don't be silly. Of course you will. It's going beautifully. Here. Jesus, you look terrible. What happened to your little fur hat? Now what's the matter? It's Patricia, isn't it? It's more than that, George. Sorry. I haven't had time to do this properly. Dad tells me you've got a boyfriend. He's always making up these stories. But you don't have to hide anything from us. I'm not hiding anything. I wasn't suggesting you were. Just saying you don't have to. You know you can confide in us. I know that. We've never had secrets in this family. I won't tell your father if you don't want me to. Please, Mum. Shut up! What's going on here? How dare you talk to your mother like that! - George here, darling. - Give me the phone, Dad. Peter's in a terrible st-- Give it-- Would you please let me live my own life? Yes, I have a friend. And he's a good man. Leave her alone. She'll come to her senses. Patsy, we won't let you down. I'll make a nice cup of tea, then we'll have dinner. I'm not hungry. What does he do, this friend of yours? He's a music teacher. Teacher? Why didn't you tell us? I'd like you to meet my parents. Mum and Dad, this is George. How do you do? Forgive this interruption. Could I borrow you for half an hour? - What for? - Go to Peter's place. I can't leave now. I'll come later. No. Right now. - Is he all right? - No, he's not. Hang on a minute. Are you running this theatrical nonsense? One doesn't run theatrical nonsense. One directs it. Does one? And is it entirely necessary... for you to direct it with my daughter in it? Absolutely essential. Your daughter is about to become... one of the more lustrous baubles... on the contemporary stage. We're not very happy about all this. - I didn't know that. - We're not! Would you like a peanut? I'll tell you what I'd like. I'd like Patricia to be left alone. Feel free to leave her alone, then. I'm not asking your opinion. I'm telling you! I'm not having her mixing with this... simpering riffraff of the theater. You'd better have something, sweetheart. Can't roar your tits off all night on an empty stomach. You'll apologize for that! Just a minute, dear. This is between us. No, it isn't, Daddy. Come on, George. When will you be back? I don't know. We must do this again some time. Trish, this is your scene. Make a big entrance... and speak your heart for a change. I thought you weren't going to let me in! I couldn't believe it was you. I've had a pretty bad day. Mine wasn't too good, either. - Sorry about that. - That's OK. That's what I wanted to tell you. Am I glad to hear you say that. Am I going to stand out here forever? Oh, no. Come in. I'll get us a drink. Lovely. Have you got any of that wine left?
