Anya! Wish you could be with us! It's so beautiful here! Big kiss. It looks great. Count on me on the next one for sure. Have fun, guys. Wake up. - Hey. Yes I was just watching it. It looks beautiful. What other video? What? We now move on to the vicious killing of two Scandinavian girls who were camping together in the mountains of Morocco, a popular spot for tourists. Moroccan prosecutors stated that the attackers pledged allegiance to ISIS, in a video made just before the killing. There is video surveillance of three people setting up camp near to where the victims were staying. Morocco is a popular tourist destination with nearly 30 million people from around the world visiting annually. A Moroccan official spokesman stated this is an act of terror. That's far enough. I'm sorry. I think I have made a mistake. No one gets this far by mistake. You have made clear your objectives and we are willing to take you seriously and help you achieve them. Are you? Hmph. You'll see. We're prepared to make a considerable investment in someone with your particular skills. But you also have to help us in certain regions with our objectives. What do you mean? I'm not sure I understand. Everything you need is in that bag. Most of the others are scared and drop the poor little guy. You'll find a passport inside that envelope with your new identity under the name of Mya Sneak. Good luck. And he just logged in. Get ready to intercept. Bourdeau? - Yeah? Check this out. What? Something's got our boy spooked. What the fuck! Who is it? Get in there! Get in there now! Now! Go! Go! Go! Smash the ball, bro. You hit too hard. Golf is not strength, but speed. Alright. - Come on, let's do another one. Now, keep your eyes on the ball. Always keep your eyes on the ball. Imagine a beautiful ass passing right in front of you. Beautiful... and now it's far. Okay. Keep your eyes on the ball. Let's hit another one. That's way better. As soon as we start talking asses, you understand. You know why it didn't go as high as it should? No, why is that? 'Cause you failed to rotate your hips. You play only with your shoulders. Okay. - Golf is like tango, you know. It's all about the hips. Tango? - Yeah. Like tango. Or like, how to make a woman cum. If you don't have the right hip, she's not gonna stay long. Hmm. - So give it a good hip kick on the impact with the ball and you'll see, it'll go off on its own. Interesting. Yeah. That's way better! Bye, bitch. Whoooo! Yeah, hold on. Yo, Hakim! Hey, long time, bro. Dude. You know me. Too much love to give. Not enough takers. Why everyone's gotta be so patient, I'll never understand. Just fucking take what you want, you know what I'm saying. Fucking go for it. So what's up, brother? Pierre's organizing another one of his parties tonight. He'd love you to come. Hell yeah, I'm gonna come. Fuck, you have no idea how much I needed this. I'm in. Yo, I got it, yeah, but I'll see you later, alright? I got a call from the label. They're saying you're looking at mid 8 figures easy. And Psycho Wrecking is a hit on YouTube. That is what I am talking about! Fuck, yeah! Dude, thank you so much. I could not have any of this without you. Seriously, thank you. I know. Nice. Fuck yeah. You know, I'm here for you at any time for only 10%. Now let's go. Yo, so check this out. My social media manager Hakim. Yeah? - He's got this French friend who organizes these special parties. And the best part about special parties in Morocco, is that I'm not going to have to fork over a shitload to a bunch of lawyers after. What are you saying? Nothing. Just a joke. No, seriously. I want to know. Relax. - What did you mean by that? Relax, relax. I was just joking. Relax. Let me make it up to you. See those three girls over there. I'll bring them to you on a silver platter. Hmm? You know that does make me feel much better. I know. Let me do the work. You just have to relax and be the superstar that you are. Fuck pansy-ass bitch. I'm Gayer, really nice to meet you. Yeah, umm, he's a star, you know Vance. Really? - Yeah. So, you wanna come? - Sure, yeah. Yeah. It's your first time driving? Yeah. Believe it or not. Oh! Alright girls, let's go. Hey Vance! We're big fans. Your friend Gayer said we could take a picture with you, do you mind? Yeah, sure. Here, let me do it. I've got longer uh, everything. What's your name? I'm Kenza. And my beautiful friend here is Rita. She's absolutely crazy about you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Umm, we're so happy to have you here in Morocco. I hope you're enjoying your time. Oh, hell yeah. You know what, are you two doing anything later tonight? Not at all. And you? No, I got a friend who's making a small little get together. Would you and your beautiful friend like to come? Sure. Yes, I'd love to come, to the party. We'll send you a message on Instagram. Yeah, wonderful. Actually you know what, don't DM me. I might not get that. Why don't you just put your number in here? This is my very special private phone for very special people. Alright. Well, I gotta get back to my game, but umm, I will see you two lovely ladies later on. Okay. Bye. - Bye. Bye. Fucking sexy as hell. Bon appétit! We got invited. We got invited. - What? Oh my God, he invited us to his private party. And you said yes? Of course, we did. Who would say no? Do you want to get raped or what? Oh, come on, don't start that again. And yeah, I wouldn't mind getting raped by a handsome man like him. You're ridiculous. Like to see your face the day that happens, God forbid. Passcode? And maybe you don't mind if I bite you? You taste so good. Oh, thanks. Try a bit lower, huh. What? You wanted me to eat you? Babe! Babe, you're hurting me! You're hurting me! Get... What the f... What are you doing? Get off! Get off of me! I want to go. What the fuck is wrong with you? Get off of me. Get... Leave me alone! Sshh. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Ssh. I'll leave you alone when I come. Fuck! No! Oh. No, no, no. Fuck. - Shut the fuck up. Oh God, you're so amazing. Get off.

No. Pierre's got all the hook-ups. Fuck, Pierre. Dude, just give me some place out of the way. And can you find me some girls that like to get a little bit freaky, not those who think that love is just a kiss and a fucking selfie. Yo, you know what, my label's moving me to a nicer area. Why don't you just get in contact with them and find me someplace quiet, ideally by a lake. I may have the perfect place. Cool. Yo, one more thing. Can you find me some better muscle? I got the best one. Terrific. Yo, just send him to the hotel this afternoon, alright? I'll be by the pool. Cheers. Hakim Aouzad? Mya? Nice to finally meet you. Hey. Pleasure is mine. Have a seat. Hi. Hi. Anything to drink? I'll have a Moroccan tea. The city is absolutely gorgeous. Is the whole country like this? Overall yeah, but we still have a few people living in the past. Anyway, what drew you to Morocco? I'm a teacher. Hm. Teaching what? Math. So you wanna see the souk? The mosques? Not exactly. I would like to see the other side of Morocco, connect with the locals a bit. You came to the right guy. I got all the secrets here. You know what I really want to see? Tell me. - Waterfalls. It's a bit of a trek. Perfect. You'll tell me about all the secrets on the way. Or instead we can go to my friend's lake house. I bet you like jet ski. Hike in the woods sounds perfect. Okay. You're a very busy man. Yeah, I'm sorry. I need to handle this. Some of my clients are pain in the ass. It's okay. I don't mind. I'll be right back. Okay. Excuse me? There is no toilet paper in the bathroom. Use your hand, bitch! Good idea. Why're you screaming? And that's what happens when you harass a girl. What's up? There is no toilet paper. Let's go. Hakim, tell me. What? On my way here, people were staring at me like I was a ghost. I'm sure I'm not the first blond woman they've ever seen? No, it's not about that. What is it then? You don't wanna know. Try me. Well, not too long ago, two Scandinavian girls that looked like you were killed while they were camping near here. The killers were local, known to have extremist views. Everybody was shocked. So what happened? Those bastards filmed the murders, dropped it online, and it was embarrassing for the whole country. Did you see it? What? No! I want to go there. Go where? Where they were killed. Why? It's just... I just do, please. Whatever. It's on the way now. Hey, you ready? As I'll ever be. He's in his office waiting. How are the kids? Great. Yours? Expensive. So we got just the Director? Got to warn you, Ross might be there today. Ah, great. Yeah, he's always in a particular mood, isn't he? Yup, he is. - Yeah. Come in. Sir. Agent Ross. What do you have for me, Bourdeau? I've got a blond and beautiful bombshell pretending to be a blogger. I got a long list of grisly, unsolved murders, all men, all misogynists, who all end up dead in all the places that she visits. Pardon my skepticism, but um, how many thousands of travelers happen to be in the same country as a murderer? And you think this is all the same person? Not just the same person. The same woman, Agent Ross. Agent Bourdeau, this is ridiculous. Wait a second. I know her. That's Doctor Akula. Let me check her feed. Has she even been to Afghanistan? Yeah. Four months ago. Why? My husband works for Medicines Sans Frontiers. Four months ago in Afghanistan, all the men in the village were poisoned. This claiming to be from Doctors without Borders actually went on TV and blamed it on the local NGOs who had been defrauding the US government for development money. So what? So when they checked their records, there was no Doctor Akula working with Doctors without Borders. Hmm. And you know what else? Akula isn't even a name. It's the Russian word for shark. Alright, pardon me again. I have seen the data of almost every unsolved cross-border-related homicide that this agency has access to. And I'm gonna say it again I've never seen anything so ridiculous in all my life! - Sir, I've been working on this case on my own time for months. Listen Ross, I get that this is a stress for you but this one is a hit. She's actively hunting down internet trolls that promote the murder of women. This is easy enough to resolve. Where's your suspect now? Morocco. Okay, pardon me. And this... you're right. This can be easily resolved. Morocco has one of the lowest homicide rates in the world, right? Average 1.4 per day. Let's just see how many murders have been committed in the area she's blogging from in the last say, 48 hours. See? One in Casablanca. None in the mountainous area. At least none reported to Rabat headquarters which would be highly irregular. Okay. Get together what you have. I want a full report in 10 minutes. You got it. Sir. Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Good morning. - Hey. Hey. What happened? Islamist scum. They killed Kamal and Nourdine. Lasri? - No, Ayoubi. Good. It's pretty bloody in here. Any suspects? After the victims were IDed, you were my first suspect. Well, maybe you should have me take a polygraph test, you know just to be sure. It has to be the work of Islamists. Both of were not exactly pious, if you know what I mean. Yeah, I know what you mean. Come on. Vroom, vroom! I learned English from American movies. That's very good. Anything else you wanna tell me? You sure? Swear? Make sure the place is completely sealed off and don't touch anything until the detectives arrive. Double homicide, huh? I want you to take care of the case. Why? - It's Selma. I understand she is your partner but given what happened with the last and the previous case involving those two I am concerned she may not be particularly invested in getting justice for the victims. Captain, with all due respect, I worked that case alongside her the whole way. She did everything by the book and more. She made sure all the witness testimony and the physical evidence was properly presented to the court. It's not her fault if the judge had more sympathy with the rapists than the victims. - She should have known better. Sir, I promise you, I will be with her the entire time. I have as much confidence in her as you have in me right now. She's the best detective in the region. If I see anything suggesting she's not doing her work, I will let you know. You have my word. I admire your loyalty, Jawad. But if this goes national I will not hesitate throwing you both under the bus if this means the reputation of our precinct. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Interpol is already on their way. Interpol, sir? They are tracking a suspect who is wanted for other crimes abroad whom they believe to be in the area. Needless to say, international interests will kill us after what happened last time. Forgive me if I'm wrong, sir, but perhaps a little international attention is exactly what will bring us back into good favors. So what is the plan for tonight? Actually Vance Wilhorn is organizing a party and he is a friend of mine. Isn't he on trial for raping women? Ah, he say they're just gold diggers. And you know what? He's not my friend. I just work for him. Doing what? Social media stuff. You know the lake house I'm talking about? Mm-hm. - It's his. I would love to meet him. You will. He is known to get pretty wild. I heard. This lake house, is it far from here? About one hour by foot. Our suspect, female Caucasian, early 30s, Russian descent. She keeps a motorcycle-themed travel blog across several social media platforms. She's targeting young men between the ages of 16 and 30 who are often in online hate groups glorifying violence against women. She often kills in the same fashion as these videos posted online. I know what you're thinking. She's probably doing us a favor. Taking all these scumbags off the streets, but the fact remains, this is a serial killer. It's making it a lot more difficult to track these online hate groups. I believe she's been tracking a particular Facebook friend of the recently deceased Sam Sandman who's sharing videos online of the two Scandinavian tourists that were murdered. I'm sure you remember that. The gentleman on the left is Hakim Aouzad, who's recently convicted of possessing pornographic material and extortion. It's likely that that's her next victim. Do we know any of her other profiles? She's currently in Morocco under the name of Mya Snik. Incidentally, Mya Snik, in Russian means "Butcher". Any others? There is one alias that keeps coming up again and again with all the alleged victims. And that is? All of the victims attributed to the suspect had images of their own murders posted online with this online content. What does the number mean? We don't know. Well, looking at where some of the victims are it looks more like a country code or an area code. Does this mean that she's just telling us where she is or that there is more than one? We can't count on anything at this point. Ah, you're gonna have to... I just think this all sounds pretty circumstantial. The idea of a secret network of misogynist-hunting, serial-killing woman? Sounds more like a paranoid male fantasy if you ask me. You should see my ex-wife when she gets together with her girlfriends after a few bottles of wine. That's exactly my point. Every one of you in this room is divorced and sees your ex as the devil. I can say for myself I have wished men dead many more times than I can count. Is that right? What? It's completely normal! Men all over the world talk about killing women everyday and do they it? Well, most don't. Why do you think we would? 95% of violent crime is committed by men and most of that is against other men. You should be afraid of yourselves not us. You know for once I'm in complete agreement with you, Agent Paxton. This is a complete waste of the agency's time and resources. I want each of you all to start scouring websites that promote violence towards women. If you find any comments from moderators deactivating accounts, cross-check them with local homicide investigators. These people use VPNs that use VPNs that use VPNs. This is nonsense! Bourdeau book two flights to Morocco before I change my mind. Two flights? - Yeah. Yes, sir. Stay behind Ross. Are you holding something back? What? No. It was just you seemed a little... You seem a little burnt out. Is it too much time behind a desk? Yeah, maybe you're right. I don't know why you left the US to come and join us, but we are really grateful to have you here. Well, you know, analyzing data to help cops catch criminals seems a lot more important than... creating algorithms for short sellers and hedge fund managers. Look, Bourdeau can be a little unorthodox, so just make sure he follows protocol, hmm? Do you always travel alone? Always. Aren't you afraid? Not all men are nice guys like me. Most men are harmless. They just like to bark a lot. Are you a feminist or something? Huh, not at all. Mya, huh? What's your family name? Snik. Is it Danish or something? Russian. This was where it happened. Are you okay? You look like the girl in the picture. Was she family or something? Is that why it was so important for you to come here, right? I can't imagine what you must be feeling. Fuck! It's not what you think, Mya. It's not what you think. Mya, I had nothing to do with this! Mya, please! Ah! Aah! Ah! Hey! Hi. - Can we take a picture? Yeah sure, you wanna a selfie? Yeah. What's your name, honey? - Um, Rim. My name's Rim. Hey, come here. Alright, get in. Here we go. Yeah. - Oh my God, love you so much. Thank you. - Thank you. I love you, too. I thought it was you, but wasn't sure. Can I take a picture with you? - Don't... You want a bump? All I want is you. Oh, you'll have all of me, baby. I want a rim job. What? I want you to eat my ass. Hey! - Come on. No. - Eat my ass. No. That's how I like it. Vance! - You know you, come on! Stop! No! - Are you kidding me? What the fuck! Come on, just... What the fuck is wrong with you, goddammit! No. - What's wrong with you, bitch? You fucking serious with me? I just told you to fucking eat my ass. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oww! What the fuck! Are you serious? No! - Bitch! Leave me! - You want some... Oh, we gotta fucking get it now. Now! - Stop, Vance! Stop! What the fuck, are you serious? What the fuck, man? What the fuck? Baba... Did you hear? - Hear what? Kamal and Nouredine. No, what about them? They were found dead. Murdered in the cafe. Lasri? - No. Ayoubi. Oh, it's not a great loss. Who did it? The guy thinks it's salafists, but I have my doubts. And what is your theory? It's not a theory, it's a feeling. This woman, this terrorist, she went into the cafe. And there was some sort of argument. It's not much to go on, I know, but... A good cop always follows his gut. Remember what happened when I ignored it? Two innocent ladies end up dead and all the nation wanted me to join them. Baba, you have to stop blaming yourself for that. You were made a scapegoat. Everyone knew the same thing you did. And no one would've ever thought that those sheep fuckers would've done something like that. Doesn't matter. We knew they were talking about it for months. I was the chief of the police and I didn't act. I'm sorry. - For what? If it was not for me, you would be colonel by now. If it was not for you, I'd be a fat djellaba mom with eleven kids somewhere on a farm. Oh, your mother hated me. I probably killed her. Sugar and diabetes killed her. No one would ever say you're that sweet. You expecting someone? No. Let me go see who it is. Hey. - Hi. How's your dad? I mean, since he lost his job, he's not the same. Hmm. You don't think it's Islamists, do you? I mean even if it's Islamists, that woman is by herself in the woods with a stranger and I just wanna go check on her. Yeah, I also thought about what that kid told you. I think your instincts could be right. Just gonna get my jacket. - Go for it. Hakim! Hakim! Hakim! Who's that? Hakim? - Yes. You just hung up on him like that? Yes. Isn't he your boss? No. - Okay, so what? You're just driving me around for free? Okay, forgive me, but you don't strike me as the charitable type. Wait, what is he... Is he blackmailing you? Something like this. Has video of me doing business. What kind of business? "None of your business" business. Look, this doesn't make any sense. What are you talking about? Hakim is my bro. He wouldn't blackmail anyone. Yes, he would. He is going to do same to you. Very soon. He pay a bitch. Then he put secret cameras. And after... he will fuck you. Fuck! I'm such a fucking idiot. - Yes. Yo, what are you talking about? Who? Yo! Okay, so I don't understand. Why don't you just, you know, in your own special way, persuade Hakim to delete the video that he has of you. He's not stupid. He stored the video in different cloud. Not his. Maybe yours. Sneaky little rat. The cloud. Did you have admin access? Yeah. I told him that he could handle all of that shit. Good. You find my video and you delete it and then I will delete Hakim. Help, help, help. So... You first. There we go. Oh fuck, it's cold. Fuck! Hassan! Yo, what the fuck is wrong with you and why are you calling me on video? I lost my phone. I need help. It's not a joke. What's it have to do with the lake house? I had nowhere else to go. What the fuck... Not so fun to be hunted now, is it? I... I don't understand, Mya. You have a friend in Florida, Sam Sandman. Yeah, he died. He took a great pleasure in sending the clip of the murder to their parents... their fucking parents. And he wasn't the only one. I don't know any of this. Of course, you do. You're the one who sent him the video from a website you own and operate. No, no, no, no, it's not my website. It's Vance's. I mean I sent the video, but not to glorify shit. He... he likes sick things. I didn't mean anything. Liar! It's the truth. I manage a lot of websites. Some of them are cats in funny clothes, accident cars, but I... I don't own them. Your friend Sandman... I deactivated him for violating the terms of basic human decency. Wha... What do you mean? Our mission is to eradicate misogyny. Is that the blogger? I think it is. I'm calling for back up. - Fine. I thought it was a myth. You're the moderator. Now who's gonna be in my video, bitch? Supermodel shows up in town. 12 hours later, we have five dead bodies! Never seen in history. It's just the beginning. Why here? Why them? Why this senseless killing? The girl they raped, what happened to her? How do you know about that? If you knew about the rape, why were they not arrested? They were arrested. I arrested them myself! And? And she was known to go out with men for money. These men were well known by the community and the court sided with them. What happened to the girl? She killed herself. And the other girl? What other girl? There's no other girl. There is always another girl. You know exactly who I'm talking about. There might be a complication. What do you mean? The man in the photos with your suspect Hakim Aouzad, he operates one of the websites your Doctor Akula may have been using to target her alleged victims. We... we know this already. It seems he is in the employ of a much bigger fish. Vance Wilhorn. Mr. Wilhorn is wanted for rape in seven different countries. "Vacationing" in Morocco to avoid excessive media attention during the trials according to Page Six. So what are you telling me? What I'm telling you is if you want to get your girl, you better move quick. You don't think the agency's gonna wanna lose out on the opportunity to bring in the world's most beloved serial rapist, do you? Just the kind of attention the Director's looking for if he's hoping to gain his next budget's quarters increases approved. That's what I love about you, Ross. Your passion for justice. What... what's going on? We've apprehended the suspect. Wow, looks like you might be in luck. One thing I know about this chick, she doesn't stay put for very long. When did it happen? The academy... classmate and no, I filed a complaint, but I didn't press charges. Because... - Because... he would have made my life way more difficult and he would have killed my father. I was a stenographer at a youth court in my country. Every day all day, every case. Rape. Sexual assault. Aggravated rape. Aggravated sexual assault. They were all minors. Rich. Poor. Educated. Uneducated. Always insisting on their innocence even when the evidence was irrefutable. 90% of all rapes never get reported. And those that do, don't even make it to trial. And aside of their crimes they were perfectly normal, perfectly nice boys. Not monsters. Sons any mother would be proud of. The worst is that the court generally felt that way, too. The laws are designed to protect male property. If the victim lived with her father or was married, the punishments were always severe. If she didn't, not even a slap on the wrist. Once I realized that, the numbers just started jumping out at me everywhere. 90% of rapists are men. 80% of serial killers are men. 97% of mass shooters are men. 94% of pedophiles are men. 80% of assaults are by someone known to the woman. Family. Friend. Neighbor. Co-worker. And as you know from your own experience, classmate. The law considers you property of a man. How can you in clear conscience respect it or obey it? Do you really want to spend your life failing to help women? If you want to make a difference, join the movement. Stop! Stop! Stop, Anya! Anya Stoy! Do what you have to do. I know what happened to your friend. I know they shared those videos to her family. I know what you're feeling. But you can't kill anymore. You can't take justice into your own hands. No! We can't talk about anything. Just you go with me that's all I'm asking. And just... Okay? Okay, please have a seat. Where is she? I'm gonna check in with headquarters. Officer Battal here has offered to give us her official statement. Of course, I just wanna get everything on record while it's still fresh in my mind. So you said that Victim 1, Hakim Aouzad, well, was fatally stabbed by Victim 2, Moh El Khadr. Correct. Uh, Hakim Aouzad was the one responsible for killing the two men at the cafe. Is that correct? Um, yes Uh... - And you believe this is why... Mr. Moh murdered Mr. Aouzad? Yeah, absolutely. Now at this point, Mr. Moh... tried to kill the missing suspect, because she was a witness. Correct? - Correct. And at this point, you intervened? Yeah. Right? Mr. Moh disarmed you, and somehow in the struggle, you broke his neck? Um, the victim was already quite fatigued from the fight um, with Mr. Aou... Aouzad. You actually believe this shit? Will you please... this... She's not a suspect here. Really? Are you kidding me? Are we on the same team here? I can see it in her eyes... - Can I handle this? She's covering for her. Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more question. Why did you arrest her? Have you seen her? She's a Russian prostitute. What? Bullshit! It's really hard for me to admit this, but I got caught off guard. She knocked me down and by the time I woke up, she was already gone. Thank you. We really appreciate you taking the time for this and again I'm very, very sorry for your loss. You know there's no way that you singlehandedly killed that man. And no, she's not a prostitute. She's a serial killer. Agent Ross has my full statement Agent Boudoire. It's Bourdeau. Look, if you'll excuse me I had a really long day and I just lost my partner. You know she's gonna kill again, right? I have no doubt. I don't why you're helping her. She was... Inspiring. You trying to get fired or arrested? Some people, my partner for example, are purists. They believe you have to do bad things to make the world a better place, everything becomes tainted. We descend into anarchy. Bless them but I happen to disagree. Feel free to contact me if I can be of any further help. What are you guys talking about? Tajines. Tajine? You hungry? I can't wait to try one of them Moroccan Tajines. Mrouzia with the ras el hanout has 20 different spices. You got your meatball Tajine with the tomato sauce. You got your fish Tajine with the chermoula tagra marinade. Oh, and I can't wait for the chicken. Chicken is made with saffron, and ginger, and garlic, a bit of cinnamon and uh, topped off with a bit of dried apricots. Mmm-mm! Vance? Samira. My friends call me "Sam". Sam? Oh shit. I have to admit I wasn't expecting someone so uh, elegant. Usually, the website curators I've hired in the past have been chunky little nerds who couldn't get a girlfriend. Kind of pathetic type. So what happened with your web curator? He met a woman. Moved on. I see. Anybody can find love. Yeah, I hope so. What about you? You uh... got someone special? Oh. Two. So what kind of content will I be managing? I don't even know what kind of business you do. I'm very versatile. Versatile, huh? I like that. Listen, some of the content is... Well, I wouldn't want it being handled by a woman. I mean obviously you're very qualified, and professional, and all of that. And some of the websites that I operate, they generate me a lot of money. But some of the stuff, I...
