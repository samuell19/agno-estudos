(tense daunting music) (upbeat digital music) (slow ambient music) (static buzzing) (slow ambient music) (relaxed intriguing music) - Okay, it was supposed to be so damn obvious. - Yeah, the only obvious thing is just how lost we are. - I guess it's supposed to be right about here. - No, we've been there. - Then we missed it. - Hodgson, I thought you knew this area. - Come on, give me a break. Nobody comes out here. It's like Death Valley. - Yeah, what better kind of place to do this kinda shit. - Yeah, uh, just exactly what kind of shit am I driving to? - Well, I don't know exactly, but I do know they got a lotta brass up there. Uh, they've got a General Randolph and there are a couple senators, a Mayfield and a uh, Chambers. - Oh, well, they uh, got my vote. - Yeah, that's why you've got the pedal to the metal in this heap out here. - Oh uh, I guess that's why guys like you get demoted to uh, transportation detail. - I wonder if there's anybody who doesn't know that story. - Yeah. My mother. (sighs) Let's try that road we saw about three miles back. - All right, anything to get outta here. (static buzzing) (tense ambient music) (relaxed intriguing music) - That's it, there. (relaxed intriguing music) - Hello, Cliff. What kept ya? - Jesus, man, they're gonna have your hides. - Well, we got delayed. - Is that Carter? - It's him all right. - Well you guys better get your butts up there while you still got 'em. - Keep the faith, Cliff, and uh, keep away from the rocks. Rattlesnakes, you know. (relaxed intriguing music) Why do they build a research laboratory way the hell out here? - Gee, I don't know, Hodge. Why do they detonate atomic bombs out in the middle of nowhere? The world is full mysteries. Keep driving. (soft whirring) - Lisa? - Next card please. - All right. Well, Miss Martyn? - Yellow. - I beg your pardon? - Yellow. The sun, the card is the sun. - You're right. You're right again. - This is ridiculous. - That will be fine, Lisa. - I didn't come 500 miles to see this kind of freak show nonsense. - Well, you must admit, she does have something going here. - While I'm sure Miss Martyn does not view herself as any sort of freak, she does possess keen psychic impulses of an extraordinary manner. You will note that the incidence of correct prediction was 100%. - How long have you had this ability? - Since I was 18. - Does that age have any bearing on all this? - Well, at 18, I was involved in a very bad accident. They gave me Genatron, an experimental drug to aid in the healing process. - How Lisa achieved her present consciousness is not so important, as to what this new level of psychic phenomena is going to be channeled into. I mean, I didn't bring you gentlemen here just to see a simple little card trick. - Get to the point. Why are we here, Dr. Williams? - This simple diversion merely illustrates the level of awareness with which we are working. - So what's the bottom line, doctor? - I understood that it dealt with de-materialization. - No, not so much de-materialization as it is matter transfer. - I think we lost 'em. - With the help of Miss Martyn, and the equipment you see here, I am able to reassemble matter, physical material from an unknown dimension. - You mean you can reach into another world, grasp an object, and bring it back here, to this lab? - Well, in a roundabout way, that's exactly what we're doing. - This is preposterous, a clear waste of government money. - I'll admit it does sound rather far-fetched. I don't suppose you'd care to demonstrate this, this claim? - I am prepared to do that at this time. - Well then by all means, let's get on with it. - That is exactly what I had in mind. My assistant is in the field now, locating a break in our antenna cable. - How long will that take? - Well, I'm going to check into that now. It should only take a couple minutes. If you'd excuse me. (soft whirring) Oh Richard, this is Dr. Williams, do you read me? - Loud and clear, doctor. - Have you located the trouble? (static buzzing) - I think so. - How long before it's in working order? - Give me five minutes and you can hit the power. - Excellent. Good work, Richard. - I'll see you when I get back. Over. - Over and out. (wind whipping) - Afternoon, general. - Connor, where the hell have you been? - Sorry, sir, we got lost. - Hodgson, I asked for you because I was told you had Indian in you and you knew this area very well. - Sir, there haven't been Indians in this area for hundreds of years. - Sounds like somebody's been doing their job. - Damn straight, private. - I hope we are not interrupting anything here. - Who is this man? - No, you're just in time for the show. - General Randolph, I want to know who these men are. - These men are here as escorts for any material that might culminate from these proceedings. - I'd like that clarified, if you don't mind. - Well, papers, equipment, documents, and even yourself if I feel it's important. - The government wants to know what's going on up here? - Yeah. - And we're gonna show them. That is, if there's anything to see. - Since you came in on the end of our discussion, Mr. Carter, I think it would be simpler if you just observed our experiment. - Thank you. - Surprised to see me, Carter? - No, I thought I smelled something when I came in the room. - Yeah, watch your mouth, sonny, they don't bust 'em any lower than where you're headed. - You wanna know something, Reiger? - What? - Your deodorant ain't gettin' the job done. - That's your finger, Connor. I know your girlfriend. - This device makes it possible to amplify Lisa's brainwaves as she attempts to channel them. - A meeting of man and machine. - Woman and machine. - In as simple jargon as I can put it, her mental energy will receive and transmit to this location, anything her mind can attract. - This, I've got to see. - Well, this will all seem easier to grasp after you've witnessed this demonstration. Ready? - Ready. (deep suspenseful music) (static buzzing) - I must ask for silence during this experiment. Miss Martyn's ability to concentrate is of the utmost importance. (mysterious music) - Dr. Williams? Dr. Williams, come in? There's a delay. I need more time. Is anybody there? (mysterious music) (device beeping and whirring) (static buzzing) (electricity crackling) (Richard yelling) (machine beeping) (static buzzing) - I think she's had enough. (machine beeping) (intense whirring) (haunting music) You all right? - Lisa? - I'm okay. Just, give me a minute. - That's the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life. - Yes. I think we've seen history here today. - Almost a spiritual experience. - Shit. - This is what we brought in last night. (tense somber music) - I wonder what this is? - It looks like a container of some sort. - Almost like a trunk or something. - Yeah, I wonder what's inside. - Maybe we could get it open. - No, no, nobody's opening this. It's going into the van, untampered with. - Surely you don't mean that? - This is going back for examination with me. - Maybe there's another one of these inside. - Yeah, alive. - [Williams] This should tell you one thing. - What's that? - We're definitely dealing with some form of intelligent life. - One thing else is probably true too, and that is, whatever made that little statue, did not make that high-tech piece of luggage. - Are you all, are you all right, Miss Martyn? - Uh, I'm much better. - That's quite a demonstration, Dr. Williams. I feel sure we can reassure you of any future funding needs. - Shh. There's something here. I can almost hear it. I can almost feel it. I, but it's so vague, nebulous. - You're tired, Lisa. You must rest. - No, I want to stay with it. There's a force here. I just can't reach it. - Reiger and Carter, get this thing into the van. Come on, let's get rolling. - You're making a big mistake here. - That's for you to think. - General. Let me go with it. Please, there is something here. I just can't put my finger on it. - Well, when you do put your finger on it, you just call me. Williams, I'll be in touch. You make sure that this equipment is all closed down. (tense music) - You know, Mitchell, for a minute there, I had a million bucks in my hand, a million bucks. - Hodge, it's just an ugly piece of rock. - Yeah, but it's one of a kind. - I can almost feel it. Come on, get this thing outta here. - Grab the end, Hodge. You heard the man. - By the way, I'll be riding with the senators. - Naturally. - Just follow my car, you won't get lost. - Reiger, I'm thrilled, endlessly. - Let's roll. - Yeah, let 'em eat dust. - Hop in back. - What's in there anyways? - [Hodge] That's Randolph's steamer trunk. - What is going on? - I think they're getting the sentry into the truck. - Good, maybe he can keep an eye on that thing. (chuckles) - Don't look like no trunk to me. - Jesus, Cliff, you got a gun. (deep somber music) How's it going back there, Cliff? - Well uh, well, well, it ain't moving. - Hell, it's just a box. - Keep your gun trained on it, Cliffy. If it moves, shoot it. - No, I'm uh, I'll just watch it. (deep mysterious music) (static whirring and buzzing) - Is that you, Cliff? - Cut it out, Hodgson. (deep mysterious music) (static whirring and buzzing) - Man, these roads are killing the shocks. (deep mysterious music) What're you doing back there, Cliff, polishing your bayonet? (deep mysterious music) (Cliff yelling) (monster growls) - What're those idiots doing? Hit the horn. (horn honking) You civilians better stay in the car. (wind whipping) Now I wanna know exactly what's happening here. (wind whipping) - Hodge, did you see where the thing went? - Just a blur. Give it up, Carter. That thing's so fast, it's miles away by now. - Ah, we might as well put him in the truck. Come on. - General, we've got that thing on the loose. - [Randolph] And dangerous. I want you to hightail it back to the lab and put a call in. - [Carter] Okay, what about him? - You'll get your orders on the horn. (wind whipping) Come on, son, I got a plane to catch. (wind whipping) - Get him there in one piece, Hodge. - Hey, let's go. It's getting rank back here. - Look, I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I'm going to have to take you back to the lab to report this. - I understand your concern, Mr. Carter, but uh, we're important people too, and we're expected somewhere else. - Listen, you can ride in the back of the truck if you'd like to, but I would suggest you wait till you get to the lab and make a phone call, maybe they'll fly you out. - You've made your point. - I tried to tell that overstuffed balloon he was making a serious error in transporting that container outta here, but he ignored me completely. Now it's gone. Escaped. The greatest scientific discovery in history has merrily run into the countryside. - This scientific discovery of yours, Dr. Williams, just killed a man within a matter of seconds. - Perhaps it has a sophisticated laser weapon of some sort. - If so, it didn't make a very clean job of it. - Uh, excuse me. I think I'll wait in the car. - Uh, perhaps that case was a vehicle of some sort, and we interrupted its flight. - (scoffs) If so, it's very upset about it. - I sense fear. It's terribly afraid of us. - From the size of that container, I'd say we're quite a bit larger than it is. - Yeah, well he makes up for it. - What did they say? - Well, Randolph and Reiger have already gone back. Now, I am to stay here and quietly locate and destroy the thing. - You can't do that. - I think that's a wise move, all things considered. - No. No! - Look, doctor, you can always beam something else down, but I wouldn't be too eager if I were you. You know, after all we could've left that container here with you. - This sort of thing never would have happened under my supervision. - Listen, doctor, give me a break, huh? - What else did they say? - Read my mind. - I can find that thing for you if you will just give me the chance. - Well, against my better judgment, I recommended it. - Why against your better judgment? - You have a pretty smile. I wanna keep it on your face. - It may be of little consequence, but last night I discovered a noticeable amount of radioactivity in that statuette. - Well, that might be helpful in tracking this thing. Could I borrow your meter? - Anything to assist our government in its hour of need. - Listen, doctor, if it wasn't for you and your handy dandy teleporter, we wouldn't be in need of anything, and Cliff would still be alive. - I can see you'll never grasp the magnitude of what has occurred here today. - I have a chopper coming for you at 18:00 hours. Have a safe trip. - Thank you. - And uh, don't breathe a word of this to anybody. - I understand. - Now, all I need is someplace to set up camp. (slow suspenseful music) Thank you. - Might not be very good. - Well, if it doesn't taste like dust, you've got a winner. - Well, what do you think? - Read my mind? - You're starved, and you'll eat anything that doesn't eat you first. - What a gift. (chuckles) - So, what's the game plan? - You know, for somebody who reads minds, you sure ask a lotta questions. - (sighs) I don't read minds. I receive feelings, emotions, and then only sometimes. - Okay, sorry. We'll wait till about 11. That way we won't alarm any of the locals. And then I take you and that Geiger counter outside and hope to hell we find something worth shooting. - Seems so senseless to kill it. An alien being, here, on earth. - I'm sorry, it's just that there's this creature out there that can kill an able-bodied man in just a matter of seconds. And that is really more than we can handle. - I think it strikes out in fear. - Well, you are still just as dead. Listen uh, I'll try to take it alive. I'm sure it's more valuable that way anyway, but no promises, all right? - All right. Had enough? - Oh, feel much better now. - Okay, I'll take that then. - So, how did you get hooked up with Mueller anyway? - I just answered an ad in the newspaper. - (laughs) Let's see, a woman, woman with psychic abilities to assist in matter transfer experiments. Previous experience, helpful. - No. Originally it was an assistant's job. Then he found out about me. - Now that contraption won't work without you, right? - I don't suppose so. Do you think the meter will work? - Unless there's a nuclear reactor in town, I think it ought to. - So, what would you like to do until 11 o'clock? - Mm, read my mind. - Ooh. (Lisa breathing heavily) (telephone ringing) - I'll get rid of 'em. Hello? Yes. It's for you. (Mitchell sighs) - Hello? Yeah, Mike, what's happening? - Mitchell, uh, I've got this thing from the van. I'm not sure. It came out of that big box. - Yeah, like a million bucks. Like what? Do you wanna give me that again? - I measured it when I got off duty, it was 13 inches. Well, I just checked it and it's 14. - Look uh, don't touch that thing. Just uh, give me your address. Okay. - I know where that is. - All right, look Mike, we're gonna be right over. Now don't bother it. It may be radioactive. Right. Okay. - (sighs) I know. We have to leave. - 'Fraid so. (tense suspenseful music) - [Lisa] Why in the world did he take it? - [Mitchell] Well, he thinks it's his ticket out of here. - Well, I don't care. I'm afraid. I hope he's all right. Mitchell. - What? - It's here, somewhere. I can, feel it. Listen to the dogs. - Well is it close by? I can't tell, I just, sense its presence somewhere. (dog barks distantly) - Well, he's just gonna have to wait. (monster growling) (eerie music) (monster growling) (phone ringing) - Jenny? (phone rings) Jenny? (phone ringing) Hello? Damn. Jenny? Jenny? For god sakes. (water sloshes faintly) (tense music) - (startles) Roger, what the hell do you think you're doing? - (laughs) I'm sorry, honey. I kept calling and calling, and when you didn't answer, I was worried. - So you rip open the shower curtain and scare me half to death? - I thought someone had done away with you, and they were still waiting for me in here. - That's it, no more late night television for you. Those horror movies give you weird ideas. - Well how about this for a weird idea? I'll climb in the tub with you and we can go skin diving. - It's only a movie. It's only a movie. (Roger laughs) - And I'm gonna eat you up. - Promises, promises. (both moaning) How's the water? - Hot. Oh no. - What's the matter? - I ran in and left the soldering iron plugged in. I'll just be a minute. - Hurry back. - Mm. (Roger grunts) (eerie music) (monster growling and yelling) (dog barking) - Roger? (dogs barking) Roger? Roger? If you jump out and scare me, I'll cut you off for a month. (haunting music) Come on, honey, cut it out. Yuck. (Jenny screaming) (Roger gurgling) (scary music) (Jenny screaming) (monster growling) (Jenny screaming) (ominous music) (knocking at door) - Come on in. - Thank you. (ominous music) - I'm sorry about calling you like that, but, well after what happened today, I'm playing this real safe. - It's all right. Where is it? - Um, over there. (slow ominous music) - No, wait a minute. Let me check it first. (meter crackling) Well, it's hot, but it's not that hot. - [Lisa] This came from the larger container. - That's right. - Is it a part of it? - Yes. - Mike, you said it was growing. - Yeah, look. I mean, it's at least an inch larger than when I called you. - It's not growing. - Hm? - It's opening itself. (eerie music) - Have you got a hammer? - Yeah, I'll get it. - You're not going to try and open it? - No, I'm gonna try to keep it closed. - Why? - Well, it may have poisonous gas in it or something. I don't know. I just don't wanna risk another disaster. - Here. - Okay, now I'm going to try to hammer it back to size. Step back. (hammer thudding) Cover your faces. (slow suspenseful music) Well? - I don't see anything. (monster growling) (loud hissing) (Lisa screams) (monster growling) (hammer thuds) (Mike cries out) - Get an ambulance! Hey, here, here. Come on, take it easy now. We got some help on the way. - We need an ambulance right away. 439 Arkham Lane. Severe throat wound. Animal attack, I, I think. Just hurry. - Easy, easy. Just lie still. Hey you got your million bucks, buddy. Huh? You can sell this story to all the scandal mags. Come on, you're a hero. (Mike gasping) (Mike coughing) (deep foreboding music) (digital beeping) (monster growling) (crickets chirping) - This is great barbecue sauce, Elbert. It's an honor to have you join me here tonight for dinner. - Well you're the best cook in these parts. - You know, the real trick to this culinary ability I've acquired is to marinate. - You uh, you got any of that marinade left? - Can't be a chef without the marinade. - (laughs) I will drink no wine before its time. - Well, the bottle said June '83, that was a damn good month. - Mm-Hmm. - Hey, don't hog it. Its time ain't up yet. (crickets chirping) - Something sure smells good over here. - Well, stranger, come on in and grab yourself a log and sit down. - Sit, Ranger, sit. (crickets chirping) Looks like you got some real good fixings going on here. - What'd you say your name was, stranger? My name is Elbert, and this here is Fred. - Good to meet ya. My name's Jimmy. And this is my dog, Ranger. - Got a good-looking dog there, Jimmy. - Yeah, well-fed too. - Listen, I don't have any money, but I got some wine left here, and I sure could use a bite to eat. - Well, I think we can accommodate you and your little pup there, Jimmy. Go on, help yourself. (crickets chirping) - This is real good. - Well, we like it. - Y'all eat like this often? - Every chance we get. - Where'd you get meat like this? - Down at the pond. Where do you get yours? (crickets chirping) (Jimmy coughs) (men laugh) - The kid doesn't have any table manners, Fred, does he? - Well, at least he left his dog. (mysterious music) (monster growling) (Jimmy screaming) Ain't got no sense of humor either. (monster growling) (men yelling) (ominous music) - Listen, it says here, "Bigfoot abducts ranger's daughter. Hairy beast ravages teenage boy." I know just how she feels, I lived with you for 20 years. Slow down. How many times have I told you? Speed kills. And it kills little animals, and it kills little kids, and it kills people with little brains. People with little brains, they never got any ambition, they never go anywhere. You've got a little brain, Jack. Yes, people with little brains should be run over. You should be run over. - Yes, Rula. - And don't say yes to me. I hate yes. Yes, yes, yes, people are always saying yes. But people with little brains, they kill little animals and they kill little kids. Slow down. - Yes, Rula. - Didn't you hear me tell ya to slow down? After all, did your little brain kinda pickle up in your little ear, so you can't hear nothing? Oh, I feel sorry for you, Jack. I feel sorry for anybody who can't take care of himself. I tell ya, that's the only reason I stayed with ya all these years. I wouldn't wanna see a critter like you suffer. Now, that's another thing that's gotta stop, this drinking. You've got your brains all so pickled up that it keeps you liquored up so that you don't even know how stupid ya are and-- (tires squealing) (scary music) (Rula yells) - Oh my, my god. - Oh. - I didn't see it happen. I couldn't stop the truck. - Oh, Jack, you ignoramus. Ya, ya hit a little animal. Get out and see if he's still alive. (Rula wailing) If you hadn't had your nose stuck in that bottle, you'd have seen the little critter. (slow mysterious music) Is it dead? - We're gonna be rich. We're gonna be rich. - [Rula] Is it dead you stupid picklehead? - Yes, it's dead. We're gonna be rich. - [Eula] (scoffs) First thing you said to me all night and it don't even make sense. What'd you expect from a senile picklehead like you? - [Jack] Look in the back, Rula, look. (mysterious music) (Rula screaming) (tense music) - Here we go. (Mitchell sighs) - They stopped the bleeding. - Oh, good. - He's gonna be okay, but it's still kinda touch and go. Look, are you all right? - I feel like I've been hit with a hammer. My head is killing me. - I'm sorry. - I'll be all right. I just, just hit me so sudden, that's all. - Look, I called in and they're sending some people over to take care of that thing in there. Do you think you're up to travel? - I feel a little better. - Excuse me. I'm Decker, the government liaison. I understand there's been a problem. Who's in charge? - I am. Go on inside. (eerie music) - Hey, don't touch that thing, biohazard. (tense eerie music) - Carter, the only reason they approved putting a lab here was because they understood there'd be no problems. - What do I look like, Professor Honeydew or something? I have nothing to do with that lab. I'm only here to clean up. - You gonna go out looking for it, or you gonna sit here all night? - Listen, Decker, I'm still in charge here, and until that changes, you stay off my back. - Carter, you better do something about this problem and fast, or I'll get in touch with somebody who can. - What, is Reiger back in town? (tense mysterious music) - [Jack] Amy, this is Jack. That's right. Is uh, Sheriff Miller in? - 'Fraid not, Jack. - Well, now you ain't gonna guess what I got out here. - A still? - Uh-uh. I got me a monster, a dead one. - No, you got an empty still. - Well, now you get Cory on the phone and you have him come on out here. - All right Jack, but he's just gonna throw you in the tank. - Now you get him on the phone, and I mean, and I mean it. - RJ-30 calling Sheriff Miller. Come in, sheriff. - Yeah, this is Cory. What's up? - Jack Murphy's over at his place, says he's got a dead monster in his shed. - You know, I told his wife to keep him out of trouble when he gets tanked up. - He's very insistent. - All right, (sighs) listen, why don't you get the guest room ready in case I have to bring him in. - With pleasure. - Of all the hick towns to get sent to. Well, least it'll give me a chance to run the lights. (ignition turns over) - Do you know where that is? - Oh yeah. You have to turn around and head down the hill. - Okay. - Hey Cory. - Evening, Jack. - I'm sorry to bring you out on a night like this. - Well, what'd you want? - Well, I got something to show you. And I got it stashed down in the cellar. - Jack, it looks like you've been drinking again. - Hey, I've got myself all dressed up for the newspaper people. They're coming down to take our pictures. - News people, what're you talking about? Where's Rula? - Oh, she's in there getting prettied up, but she'll be out in just a minute. - You really got anything down there? - (laughs) I sure do. Why don't you to go down and take a look. - Okay, but this better be good. (Jack laughs) (slow suspenseful music) - Well, what do you think? Maybe there's a reward for it or something. - Jack, there ain't a damn thing down there. - What? - Listen, you better just get in the house before I haul ya downtown. - Huh? - You ain't nothing but a pain in the ass. - Huh. - Huh. (slow suspenseful music) (Jack yells) - Help! Help! (yelling) Help! - Ah, knock it off, Jack. Who do you think you're fooling? - [Jack] Come help me, sheriff! (yelling) (monster growls) (yelling) Oh no, oh no! (Jack yelling) (monster growling) - Jack? (Jack yelling) (Jack shuddering) (Jack gagging) (monster growling) (Rula yells) Get back in the house. - Did it get away? - Yeah. Who are you? - I'm Mitchell Carter, Army. - What was that thing? - Well, you tell me. Nobody I know has seen it. Uh, except maybe you. - Listen, that thing's small. It's about that high. But I'll tell ya, it's fast. (static crackling) - Which way did it go? - That way. - Yeah, it did, it went that way. - We have got to find this thing. - Listen, you go that way. I'm gonna go radio in and then I'm gonna circle back around the neighborhood. This is Sheriff Miller to RJ-30. Do you read? - I read you sheriff. I got the guestroom ready. - Forget about that. Jack's dead, and there's some kind of dangerous animal on the loose out here. Listen, send a uh, coroner and a doctor for Mrs. Murphy. I think she may be in shock. Over. - Over and out. (mysterious music) - It's very near. (static crackling) - Well, I would tend to agree with that. - Listen. Sounds like it's coming from over there. - Okay, let's check it out. (steady banging) (mysterious music) - Who's there? - Jesus. I almost shot you. - Wouldn't be the first time. - What are you doing in there? - I like to shop at night. Beats the rush. And I hate long lines. - You know, this isn't a very good night for that. - Don't I know it. It's always like this in the middle of the month. Holidays are coming on, things'll pick up. - Where do you live? - Well, I got this little place my daughter pays for, and I don't hang out there much though. - Well, you'd better stay there tonight. - Hey, you guys think I'm nuts, don't ya? I know what you want. You ain't got me fooled. These are my dumpsters and I've had 'em for a long time. So don't get no ideas. - Listen, just take my advice and stay inside. - Hey, that's nice. Where'd you find that? - Come on, Lisa, let's go. - Hey, before you folks go, give me a hand down outta here. Evening, folks. - [Lisa] Bye. - Well, well what do we got here? A little ad. Boy, he sure is cute. I wonder who threw him away? Well, we'll just hang him up here so folks can see him. (monster rustling) (tense suspenseful music) (monster growls) - Help! (monster growls) (tense scary music) - Mitchell, wait. - What is it, Lisa? - I, I think it's headed toward the Hershville building. - What? - It's uh, an abandoned old building where bums go to crash out. - Must be dinner time, huh? Where is it? - Just down there a couple of blocks. - Okay. Come on, if get down there in a hurry we can beat Reiger. - Hey, what is it with you two anyway? - Listen, it's a complicated story, but it's longstanding. Come on. - It's definitely inside. I can sense it. - All right. - Wait, shouldn't we wait for the others? - No, we don't-- - Carter. What took you so long? We're running late. - Dammit. You're the second joker that snuck up on me, Reiger. - And you say I got no sense of humor. - Yeah, you're a laugh a minute. - Yeah? Well get your ass up there. See anything? - Down that way. - What makes you so sure? - Well, this slime, it leads all the way down the wall. - These are bottles of sulfuric acid, might slow the thing down a bit. - Yeah, but be very careful. That stuff is extremely dangerous. - Yeah, well I won't be needing any of that. This thing'll cut anything in two. - Just like in 'Nam, right? - Yeah. Used to level entire villages with one of these. - Mm-hmm, women and children first. - Shut up, Carter. - What's the matter, Reiger? Still can't sleep at night? - Let's move out. (gun cocks) Kill the son of a bitch. - It feels much stronger now. I, I think it's moving again. - Yeah, will you stay in here? We don't need you. - Carter? - Look, maybe he's right. It's safer here, stay here. I think we can manage. - Listen, don't be a hero. Destroy the thing. - (chuckles) No problem with that. Let's move out. - Mitchell. - Look now, don't worry. We'll get him this time. You just stay here with uh, ole J. Edgar Hoover. He'll take care of you. - All right. See ya. (tense suspenseful music) - Walker, Hench, take the south side of the building. Carter and I'll go north. - Oh good, I got John Wayne on my side. What's the plan, Duke? - Well, you go down on him, and when I hear your moans, I'll come running. (slow suspenseful music) - Okay, increasing. (slow suspenseful music) - It smells down here. - [Reiger] Yeah well, we're not here to judge the housekeeping. - Well, it's not the housekeeping, Reiger. - Yeah, what you smell is chicken shit. Follows you wherever you go. - You know, you have got a big problem, my friend. (gun clunks) Come on. Let's see where that smell's coming from. (slow suspenseful music) (man yells) - Showtime.

That bastard's having babies. - [Mitchell] Yeah, Reiger, you better kill it. - Hey, shut up, Carter. I'm in charge here. (tense music) Better kill it. (monster yells) (gunshot blasts) Son of a bitch, you made me miss. - Damn you, Reiger, you almost hit me with your toy. - Yeah, let me, Carter. (adventurous music) (Mitchell grunts) It took off with your brain.

We got him. - Yes, I know. - [Mitchell] What happened to him? - His neck is broken. - How the hell did that happen? - I'm sorry, Mitchell, but we had to know how our combat unit would fare under stress and aggression. - What? - The creature was our soldier designed to fight our wars, and it is a success, at least in most areas.
