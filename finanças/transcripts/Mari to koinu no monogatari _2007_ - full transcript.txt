When can we go home? Nobody knows. It's not up to us. I have to go save the carp! My mother and I depend on them, I have to go back. Don't be unreasonable. My life depends on living things, yours doesn't! What?! My life depends on caring for rice seedlings! - Stop it! - I didn't say... Enough of that! We're all well and safe here. Isn't that enough? Sorry. How did it come to this? How did it...? Grandma, are you OK? As soon as we know something, we will tell all of you. They say Kazuo didn't make it. Buried in his car in a mudslide... Aya! Auntie Saeko... Look! Volunteers brought clothes. I thought this would suit you. How about it? Thank you. Auntie... I wonder if Mari has food? Are Goo and the rest OK? They're OK, because Mari's a mother. A mother can do whatever her babies need her to do. I'm sure she'll try hard. So Mari will definitely be OK too. Really? Really! Was my Mom also like that? Of course! She was so kind, and so strong. She loved you the most. I'm sure she's watching over you even now. Is it good? Hello. Hello. Thank you for the other day. Your name's Aya, right? I'm sorry that I couldn't rescue Mari. Mari is a mother. That means... she's strong and will be OK. I see... That's true! All contact has been lost, and Yamakoshi is a "landlocked island" at risk of... being submerged as rain swells rivers blocked by mudslides. "The Animals Left Behind" Submerged?! How can it be submerged?! It's all over... this is the end! Dear... Ryota! Mari?! More rain may destroy Yamakoshi! If that happens, Mari will die. I've had enough of dying! I don't want her to die, just like our Mom did! Alright. I'll go there. I'll go and rescue Mari and her pups. So you... just wait here. I'm going with you! Aya... I'm going with you! Ryota! Where you going? To Yamakoshi. What?! Don't tell anyone. We'll take the old road. Where can they be? Do you know where Aya and Ryota are? I see... I wonder where they went? Are you OK? Find them? No, I couldn't. Where did they go?! It can't be... Huh? Sir... Nao... What's wrong? What's wrong?! Will you be OK? They're kids, can't have gone far. I don't want to bother everyone. I'll call when I find them. We may lose contact, so you stay here. OK. Aya, hold tight. children? I didn't see any. Alright. Thank you. The old road...? Are you OK? Let's go. Ouch! What's wrong? I'm OK. I'm OK! Aya... Hold on tight. Are you cold? Let's rest a bit. Mari... Will we find her? Yeah. I'm sure we'll find her. Ryota... Thank you. Your hands... Aya? A high fever! What'll I do? What...? Ryota! Aya! I haven't seen Yuichi for a while. Or Ryota and Aya either. What's going on? Aya! Ryota! Dad! Ryota! Are you OK? No injuries? Dad, Aya is... What is it? - Fever. - Fever? She does feel hot. Aya, be strong. I'll carry you. Ryota, help me. Let's go! What is it? I'll... I'll search for Mari. What?! I can still walk, so... Don't talk nonsense! You'd die doing that! I'm going anyway! Ryota... Dad... You said there would be worse things ahead. You said there would be many things that can't be helped. But... I... But I won't accept that! I don't want them to die like Mom! I don't want to feel like that. I can't stand that. So I'm going! I'm going! - Ryota! - Let go! - You can't! - Let go! You can't! I said you can't go! Damn! Listen, Ryota, you and Aya are most important to me! Most important in the world, more than anyone or anything. So for you and Aya, I'll be there to protect you no matter what happens. Understand? No matter what! Dad! The main road? It's blocked off. Then I'll take the old road. Yuichi? Aya? - Ryota... - Ryota. I'm sorry to have troubled all of you. I'm sorry. As long as you're all OK. Yuichi, we'll take Aya. Thanks so much. How is she? Sleeping from the medicine. How's Ryota? He's taking a shower. How's Aya? Sorry to worry you, she's OK. But it's too bad Mari couldn't be rescued. Aya and Ryota dared to go so far. I'm really sorry for this trouble. Never mind... It's kind of heartwarming. I hope Mari is alive. She is alive. Definitely. It's been quite a while... since we slept side by side. What's wrong? My muscles will hurt tomorrow! I'm sorry, Dad. No... I'm the one that has to apologize. After your Mom died, I was at a loss. I had you look after Aya, since you're her brother. I always relied on you. You had a tough time too, like Aya. No, that's not so. I remember playing with Mom, going to the sea and other things like that, but Aya has no memories. Also, I made a promise to Mom. I was so happy... you visited the hospital yesterday. When I saw Ryota enter the room holding Aya's hand, I was surprised how he'd become such a big brother. It made me feel so happy. Ryota, from now on, no matter what, please hold Aya's hand tightly and protect her. You knew about that letter?! You can hear everything in that little house, even with my bad memory I'll never forget it. Thank you, Ryota. That's from... your Mom. Let's go to sleep! Come here! Closer! Our life in the gym continued. Nobody talked about it, but we believed we'd return to Yamakoshi someday. Aya didn't mention Mari after that, but I knew that she was always thinking of her. Aya continues to believe Mari and her pups are fine. Aya... Better hold my hand. But, I'm afraid that... Grandpa! Aya, Ryota! Are you well? Grandpa, you'll be released soon. So we brought you a present. A present?! "Magic cane Number 2" Number 2? With this, can you walk by yourself? I can walk! I can! We did it! Aya, Ryota... Yes? I owe thanks to you both. Thanks? You two gave me courage. You taught me how important it is to believe without losing heart. We taught you?! That's why I won't give up. Thank you. Here it comes! It's coming! For this visit home, we'll take only one member per family. It's only to look at the situation, so we'll return in two hours. The village is in terrible condition. Prepare yourself for that. Those from Mushigame, please board. Who'll represent the Ishikawa family? I will, of course. But you'll be going as a member of city hall... Yes...? Can you be the rep? That's not right! Instead of Aya, someone else... Your wife can go with you. No, it'll be too sad to see. What about you? My husband will be enough. Will you go? Aya? May I?! Dad? Let's have faith. Be strong, Aya. Hey, Ryota! Go with Aya, in my place. Huh? Go and find Mari. I can see it! Two hours only! You must meet here in two hours! OK! What's wrong? Thank you. Good girl. Wait! careful, Ryota. "Mari's House" Wait! It's dangerous! Let's go. Mari... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mari. Aya... It's Goo! - choki! - Paw! Goo, where's mom? It's Mari... It's Mari! Dad... Mari is amazing. As all moms are. Let's go. Father... Let's not move to Nagaoka. I don't know when it'll be, but let's return to Yamakoshi. And it will include... everyone in our family. I see... After that, spring came once again. Spring 2OO5 "S"... song! Groundhog! Welcome back. We're back! Grasshopper! Rose! Elephant! Tank! Kid! Dart! Tea! Attic! "C"... crow! "W"...? Woof! Woof! can't end in "F"! You lose! We're back! Let's go! - I'm back! - I'm back! I'm back. We'll say those words when we move back to Yamakoshi! - Fictional film based on reality. - - Scenes may not be realistic. - - Many rescue personnel did provide aid to animals in distress. - - We pray for a rapid recovery from the sufferings of calamity. -
