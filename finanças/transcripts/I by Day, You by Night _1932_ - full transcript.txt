I by day and you by night Start! Hey! Don't you hear? Start! Running! Take it easy! Turn it down! You'll blow the speaker! All right? - Yes! Is Helmut in there? Where else should he be? Good morning, Helmut! Good morning. Programme change today, eh? Ah no, that's the one from last week. Clever guy. How is your new film? Have you already seen it? Just one moment. Look here. "This fairy tale from reality clearly shows that eventually for each of us the golden moment will come. Hopes and dreams are budding, and fortune knocks with soft fingers on the panes of your window." Good, isn't it? - Nonsense, it's all hokum. I say! - What is it? Only look at me! Relief waiter at the Casanova nightclub. For me there's no golden moment. - Don't say that! "Nobody prophecies to us at the end of the day when we go to bed..." Unfortunately I go to bed early in the morning, by night someone else sleeps in my bed. "And when we dream of fair and blissful beings..." Well, two days ago I dreamt of the fair and blissful being to whom my bed belongs at night. "And then, happiness knocks at your door." Indeed; it looked like an old scarecrow. " And knocks, and knocks..." Just like my landlady, she's always knocking, too. "Take hold of it, before it's too late!" But it isn't too late! With me, it's always too early! Just listen to my landlady. "Too early, young man! A quarter to 9 isn't 9! You know well that until 8 o'clock in the morning your bed is let to a young lady." That's no life, really. Just take it easy. One day it will knock on your door, too. Helmut! Are you sleeping up there in your booth? Shut up! I have to switch it on again. I'll see whether the shutters have already been raised. THE BOMBASTIC-FILM CORPORATION HAS THE HONOUR TO PRESENT! "ALL THIS IS YOURS!" FEATURING THE NEW HIT SONG: #"... ON SUNDAYS, WHEN I GO TO MY CINEMA!" # and see the fine people in the film, # I think again and again: # If I could only once, just once, be as happy as them. # Every day champagne and caviar, # and a car, and even a castle, # For a long time I've been wishing for that in my wildest reveries. # On the 75-pfennig-seat # I'm yearning for a lovely sweetheart # who, like in the film, must make me happy finally. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the world through rose-coloured glasses, # I still dream on Monday morning: # "To live like them just once!"; but one never gets it done. Miss! Miss! Yes? That old scarecrow! Wouldn't be bad if she got up somewhat earlier. Cornelia Seidelbast - Member of the Court Theatre Lippe-Detmold Don't be so impatient, Elvira. # Every day champagne and caviar, # and a car and even a castle... # On the 75-pfennig-seat # I'm yearning for a lovely sweetheart # who, like in the film, must make me happy finally. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the world through rose-coloured glasses # tralalalaladam... # Grey is the week I see ahead of me on Mondays # and the following week is equally dull again. # You get almost nothing out of your life. # When will a better fortune start for me? # All that remains for me on dreary days # is only here and there a little glimmer of light. # On Sundays, when I go to... # ... and again: if I could only once, just once, be as happy as them. You wore wonderful jewellery, Frau Seidelbast. Was it all genuine? I am playing the princess Eboli, the paramour of the King of Spain. Ah yes: "Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez is over now, and yet your highness quits these joyous scenes no happier than before." Actually you haven't changed so much, Frau Seidelbast. You flatterer! But after all, why should I have? "I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing." Goodbye, Frau Seidelbast! # Madame is going out, Madame is going out # Madame is going out, she's going out, she's going out # Madame is going out # Madame is going out, Madame is going out # Madame is going out, yes, she's going out, she's going out. # Where is she going to? # Madame is going out, going out # Where is she going to? # Madame is going out, going out # Madame is going out, Madame is going out # Madame is going out, Madame is going out Yes, yes, we know by now that she's going out! Have you seen that car? - Much nicer than our omnibus! Pardon, madame. Thank you. - You're welcome. Good morning, Frau Seidelbast. Too early, young man! A quarter to 9 isn't 9 o'clock. Did you sleep well, Frau Seidelbast? You know very well that until 8 o'clock in the morning a young lady sleeps in your bed. The bed hasn't even cooled off. Frau Seidelbast! Every morning it's lying on the floor! Confound it! I will take the young lady to task. That person's impertinence! If I get hold of her! She won't have anything to laugh about! That miss pays her rent in time. That's how I know the lot. By the way... The rent, young man! Frau Seidelbast, what actually did you play there? There I played the Rautendelein. That elfin being was one of my best roles. That was in the last century. Oh, how time passes. Why all this flurry... From now on, put your hat into the wardrobe, young man. Sleep well! There! # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema... Even on Sundays! # and see the fine people in the film They're already broke, too! # I think again and again: If I could only once, just once... If I could only once smash up that damned apparatus! # Every day champagne and caviar... That's what you think! # And a car, and even a castle... On the never-never! # For a long time I've been wishing for that in my wildest reveries. Shut up! # On the 75-pfennig-seat # I'm yearning for a lovely sweetheart # who, like in the film, must make me happy finally. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the world through rose-coloured glasses # I still dream on Monday morning: # "To live like them just once!"; but one never gets it done. Silence! Miss! Miss! Miss, won't you go to the shop at all today? Indeed not. Today, I'm manicuring privately. So it doesn't matter that much. And besides, I have a car at my disposal today. In one word, you give notice? Why this? I don't understand a word. If a 'furnished' young lady drives a car, she'll turn her back on my bed soon. I'm afraid not. Today I'm manicuring Director Kr?ger. His car is being repaired over there, so I'm getting a ride, that's all. Another new day. Frau Seidelbast! My blue dress lies on the floor again today. That base villain! I will take the gentleman to task. What impertinence! If i get hold of him, he won't have anything to laugh about! # We reign in pink, # and whoever pledges this to me # won't let me down when it rains. # We agree about one thing: # often paths are stony, # but proud and purposeful ahead, and it'll go off all right. # Noone will get us down, noone will get us down, # because we are young and beautiful. # Everyone can, everyone can # keep a close eye on us. # Noone keeps us, and we like it # everywhere as much as we like it here. # Noone will get us down, # not even someone who has got more money than we have. # We stick together through water and flames, because true comradeship keeps our hearts warm. # But if someone gets in our way who doesn't know about it # then we say: Gentleman, stay away, you're not pulling our leg! # Noone will get us down, noone will get us down, # because we are young and beautiful. # Everyone can, everyone can # keep a close eye on us. # Noone keeps us, and we like it # everywhere as much as we like it here. # Noone will get us down, # not even someone who has got more money than we have. Excuse me, could you perhaps tell me where Berliner Stra?e is? Sorry, I can't. Pardon me, would you like me to show it to you? May I come along with you? You don't seem to have a lot to do, do you? Why? Well, you stroll along by night, and by day you take a walk. A happy person who can afford to do this these days. Goodbye. Escort refused? It's all going rather a bit too quickly, don't you think? So when do we meet again? How should I know? I will tell you: this afternoon. Ah! You're very sure of yourself. At 5 o'clock, yes? Better at 7 o'clock, I can't make it earlier. But I only have time until 9 o'clock! So at 5 o'clock, won't you? Goodbye. Don't forget: at 5 o'clock at the 'Normaluhr'! - Good morning, Hans. - Good morning. Mercedes 1A 1224. Hey, now hopes and dreams are budding! Come, let's make a call. But to whom? - To the motor traffic department. Here's the motor traffic department. One moment, I'll look it up.. The manicurist has arrived. - I'm coming. Good morning, Mr. Kr?ger Let's start with the work. - Nice that you came here. I'm making an exception for you. May I ask for your hand? (the telephone is ringing) I'll be back in a moment. Director General Kr?ger. You want to talk to my daughter? No way. Who are you? What do you want from her? One moment... With whom are you talking? Pardon? Only with some gentleman. Drop the act. I only want you to bring the right one into the house. That's enough. I know, you want a rich son-in-law. But I told you a hundred times before, you can count me out. And I will marry that man, too. That Wolf, that terrible Wolf. But as long as you live in my house, I won't accept that you put off honest people, so that you can walk about with that Wolf. That rascal who has got nothing, knows nothing, will be nothing. Wolf! Wolf! To hear something like that! Hello, Wolf! - Hello, Trudchen. It's very late, we'll be late for the lecture again. Oh, look at you! Anaemia, severe anaemia! Wolf, you didn't have breakfast. I did, tea and melba toast. Wolf, you're out of money again. Yes, I have... - Show me! You know, Trudchen, I can't... - So how much do you need? Five marks? Three marks? No. - Well, all right. Let's say... let's say... one mark. Well, I knew it! Beg your pardon. Hey, it must be that house over there. Parkstra?e 33. Come, let's move on. - Oh, come on. At least twelve rooms. I'd like that for sure. Look, someone's coming! Excuse me, may I ask for a light? Thank you. Take a seat, my dear child! Properly ascertained: the daughter of the director general. Pity. Then it's no use. So what? Start the action! If you meet her this afternoon, only put a big bunch of roses under her nose. # Roses, # red roses... # the dining table must burst from roses when she comes. # Come, the world is beautiful! # Don't let the time pass by, # I've been waiting for you forever. # Flowers are blossoming, # but I am all alone. # When will you be with me, # when will springtime come for me, too? # Come, I'm tortured by impatience, # my heart is sick, and it's all your fault. # If you don't come, the roses will have bloomed in vain. # If you don't come, the larks will have sung their songs in vain. # Time is moving slowly, and I can't find rest, # because today I have my most beautiful rendezvous. # If you don't come, all my yearning will be in vain, # if you don't come, what should be the purpose of my life? # Many a night I have wasted without you. # If you don't come, # I will have dreamed in vain. It's already 5 o'clock. We'll be finished in two hours, won't we, dear miss? Yes, madame. Excuse me. Hey, Erna.. - What's the matter? I have an appointment at 5 o'clock. - Then simply get a headache. Manicurist! Manicurist! Come, lay down. Frau Waiser! Yes, what is it? - Frau Waiser! Have a look at this, Frau Waiser! Manicurist! Yes, madame, beg your pardon, just one moment, please. Grete, for heavens sake, what happened? I... I have to see a doctor. But not in this condition, dear... Come, lean on me. Manicurist! Manicurist! Oh, she's insisting... With pleasure, just one moment, madame! Dear Mrs. Waiser, I'm really not well, let me go to the doctor. Calm, calm, that's the main thing. Follow my example, nothing can get me worked up. Now it's the telephone... I'll go crazy... Director Kr?ger speaking. Tell me, dear Mrs. Waiser, is Grete available? Ah, Director General Kr?ger... How's this? Your nails can't have grown back so quickly. Oh, for the pedicure! No, Miss Grete doesn't pedicure. No, out of principle. But I have an excellent gentleman... No, no, a man is out of the question. Horrible, horrible, no, no, I don't want that. You don't want that, well... What else does Grete do? Whether she's doing WHAT? A face massage?! Go and tell that you're coming. Why? I can't do it right now. This way you'll at least get out of the shop! I really can't do anything else than to send you another girl. Now I've really had enough of that Grete. Now, don't bother, Frau Waiser... - Grete! Customers first! - But, for heavens... Sure, Director General, I'm coming! # She's coming, she's coming, she's coming! # You came to me, # yearning no longer needs to be in vain. # You came to me, # now you shall be the happiness of my life. # Many a night that I have missed without you # I don't seem to have dreamed all in vain. I once had a girlfriend, too. But we never sang together. Hello? Kr?ger speaking. Yes, Kr?ger. Someone has just hung up. Surely it was that Wolf again. I'm glad you came! I almost couldn't make it. Oh, that would have been terrible. Did you bring your car? No. Do you have yours available? My car? No... that is... No problem, then let's take a cab. Where are we going? I don't know, wouldn't you like to suggest something? Well, I don't know either, but as far as possible, yes? Perhaps to the Zelten? No, that's not far enough. Or, to Koll? No, that's all far too near. But where to, then? To Potsdam. As you wish. To Potsdam. It's wonderful here. By the way, do you know what Sanssouci means? 'Without sorrow'. Sanssouci Palace was built in the year 1747 by Knobelsdorff on command of Frederick the Great it the then modern rococo style. Please kindly put on the slippers, ladies and gentlemen. This room is the so-called vestibule. It is realised in stucco marble. The ornamental carvings on the doors are by the younger Hoppenhaupt, and the gilded stucco reliefs above the main doors are by Ebenhech. They represent, in a way, bacchantic scenes. Here you can see the 'Dance of the Nymphs", and opposite, on the other side, the 'Triumphal Procession of Bacchus'. Ladies and Gentlemen, would you please go over there. My young lady, you somewhat live too large. The ceiling painting shows the well-known Flora, the goddess of flowers with her genii. It's the last work by Johann Harper. Please, Ladies and Gentlemen. Take a little care, or you'll slip again. This room, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the so-called 'Little Gallery'. Here, the Great King used to walk to and fro with his greyhounds on rainy days, so to speak, to promenade. The candelabra as well as the two fireplaces you can see are of French origin. Here we are now in the Great King's library. This is his so-called reference library. Here are 2.200 volumes, by writers from Greek antiquity, and also by French writers. Everything in French language, yes. There's even a dedication by Voltaire in his own hand, so to speak. The walls are made from cedar wood and have bronzed brass bars, the ceiling is stucco work; the king's favourite room. Did he really read all this? Impossible, nobody has so much time. It was strange: no heating, no electric light, only books, books. Originally, the fortepiano stood in the middle of the room, as Menzel depicted it in his famous painting "The Flute Concert of Sanssouci'. Here is his music stand. And here we have his flute, his original instrument, so to speak. All this was, in a way, in his personal hands. On the music stand there is still the original sheet music by his music teacher Quantz. And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, we enter into the king's audience room. In the final years, the audience room was also used as a dining room, as the dining hall proper could not be heated, so to speak. The sculpture work above the doors still comes from the time of construction, 1747... Well, don't you want to have a look at the flute, too? No. Apparently you're not interested in the flute at all. Not at all. Well, and you even admit it! Better than telling a fib, isn't it? This here is the marble hall, in which the famous 'round table' was held. Please, don't. Oh, come, the others are at least two rooms ahead of us. But the door is closed! Where are others? We are locked in. - Well, I say... You're right. Hello! Hello! Hello! What are we doing now? Perhaps on the other side. It's closed here, too. What are we going to do now? What shall we do? Wait. In a few minutes the next tour is coming along. No more guided tours today Too bad that there's no electric light here anywhere! One moment! We'll have that fixed right now. Candlelight. Nice for a change. Well... But if... But if this evening no further guided tour came along... As for me, I would like that. 9 o'clock. I have to leave. I have to leave! I must go back to Berlin! But what is it all at once? Too bad! 9 o'clock already! Do you have something to do? Of course I have something do, I must return to Berlin! It is something very urgent? You didn't tell anything about it! An important business meeting, impossible to make them wait for me. Ah, someone's waiting! Who is waiting for you? That's irrelevant. I'm simply expected at 9 o'clock in Berlin! Closed, too! Is there no way of getting out of here? Don't you want to tell me who is waiting for you? Who is it? It's totally irrelevant who is waiting. Just tell me who it is that is waiting for you! The main thing is that we get out! A short while ago you were so happy about us being locked in. Please don't be angry with me, but I really have to leave. I am not angry with you at all. But the lady that you keep waiting will be angry. Which lady? Your girlfriend. - Nonsense. Or do you want to tell me that a man like you needs to do business in the evening? Surely there's a woman behind it all! Are you...jealous? Oh, no! But after all... you like to know where you stand. I would tell you, too, if I had a boyfriend. One moment... one moment... I only want to see whether those two doors are locked, too. All right. Then let's stay here. You wanted to tell me something about your boyfriend? Did I? Well, about which one? You have so many of them? Many? That's not a problem. A problem is always only one. And? What about that one? Yes, the one... Now I really begin to like it here. Is that true? - Yes. Like in the cinema. Just like in the cinema. Why like in the cinema? Everything's real here, it's the real world. Everything's real here, it's real. In the cinema, surely music would start to play here. Why music? When... when things become nice, music always begins to play. Who's playing the flute here? Who should play the flute in Sanssouci? Open up! Open up! What's up? - There's light in the palace! Burglars! Lehmann, call the police at once! - Yes! The others follow me! Fachinger, the pistol! Flying squad! What is it? What is it? In the music room of the Great King, of all places! Will you make yourself scarce! I'll teach you... Unbelievable! Reporting! Well, this was so to speak, in a way, a false alarm. Nothing much happened as far as I could ascertain. So drive back home! Are you driving to the station? - Yes! One moment! Hurry, hurry, quick, quick, quick! I couldn't run any faster! Thank god! We'll surely find a cab at the station. Of course. Oh dear! My wallet! Stolen? I probably lost it in running. Terrible, I don't bring you any luck. So... Well... You seem to be very much in a hurry. Yes, unfortunately. But I have time tomorrow evening, at 9 o'clock. As we've agreed, yes? For sure, yes? Just go. So tomorrow evening at 9 o'clock! Don't forget! Goodbye! # Sure, everyone would like to be a star once in his life, # but sadly the beautiful fairytales aren't true at all, # and everything only appears true. # The lobsters and oysters are great to look at, # but after the happy end one has to leave, # and at home there are pork sausage sandwiches! # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the fine people in the film, # I think again and again: # If I could only once, just once, be as happy as them. # Every day champagne and caviar, # and a car, and even a castle, # For a long time I've been wishing for that in my wildest reveries. Please put it out again. I beg your pardon. I only wanted to switch off the radio. Those songs spread like a plague. Please, stay. Please. You're quite right, Frau Seidelbast. Those songs! In life things work out differently. You go out in a car and come back with the tram. Have you ever gone through anything like that, Frau Seidelbast? Oh no, my dear child. There were no cinemas when I was young. I didn't wait for a Count from a film. With a bridal bouquet, I entered into holy matrimony with Herr Seidelbast. You didn't understand me, Frau Seidelbast. I had something totally different in mind. Good night. Good night, miss. # If I could only once, just once, be as happy as them. # Every day champagne and caviar, # and a car, and even a castle, # For a long time I've been wishing for that in my wildest reveries. # On the 75-pfennig-seat # I'm yearning for a lovely sweetheart # who, like in the film, must make me happy finally. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the world through rose-coloured glasses # I still dream on Monday morning: # "To live like them just once!"; but one never gets it done. One cherry cake, three pastries... Now, now... Do you know how much a cab to Sanssouci costs? You're dreaming, eh? No, but I'd like to sleep. You know, if you work the whole night long and then do a temporary job in the afternoon... Do you really need to? Well, do you know how much a cab to Sanssouci costs? Waiter! Waiter! - One moment, my colleague is coming. Waiter, what cakes do you have? Cream cake? - Yes, one moment. Trudchen, I can't eat anything else, I've had... Calories, calories! A man must get calories. Heavens, Wolfchen, don't turn around. - What is it? The bank is here. Talk with me, talk with me. The bank? Oh, I understand. Don't talk so loud. Talk with me. Oh! Mademoiselle! Good afternoon! A ghastly fellow. Crumb cake, cheese cake, sand tarts, cherry pie... The bill, please! - The bill? You're welcome. So, pay! May I help you, mademoiselle? - No, thanks. I'll manage. How much shall I give him as a tip? Idiot! Ten pfennigs! Dear Frau Seidelbast, tell me... If a gentleman sees a lady in a car, and if he thinks that the lady owns the car, and he's very friendly to the lady afterwards, does he have the lady or the car in mind? Dear child, all my life I played only tragic roles. I'm not competent if it comes to French comedies of mistaken identities. I hope it won't be a tragedy if I tell him the truth this evening. In any case... In any case I am going to wear my new dress. Where's my dress... What an impertinence! That impertinent scoundrel! Frau Seidelbast, is that still not enough reason to finally throw out that impertinent rascal? Good that I barred the door, otherwise the disaster would have happened! Frau Seidelbast! Frau Seidelbast, you have to let me in! No, young man, she's still at home. Frau Seidelbast, you must let me into the room for five minutes. Impossible! Please tell the young lady that it's a matter of vital importance. That won't help, the young lady is furious at you. She would let anyone into the room, but certainly not you! But hasn't that person got a heart? I must get in, I have to change my clothes. In five minutes, the young lady has to leave. In five minutes? I... I will take care of that. "Madman, avaunt!" "Where shall I find, poor sufferer, an asylum?" "Here force assails me, and within is murder." I'm happy, young lady, to see you in such a good mood. People like you don't bear a grudge for long. Young men are made for forgiving them their foolishness. I knew that you have a good heart. Five minutes! Four are already over. Helmut, I've no patience left. I don't know why you're so nervous! - Because, because... Today I'm going to tell her truth. That I don't have a car, that I don't have money, that I'm a waiter. Don't be ridiculous! Hans! What is it? - So you want to tell her that... That's none of your business! - Oh yes, it is! Shall I stand by when my friend is about to miss his greatest chance? Think of that golden moment! - I am thinking of the golden moment! Argh! Frau Seidelbast! That beast doesn't have a heart! Who's calling me? Frau Seidelbast, what are you saying about this? I say nothing. War is war, and I'm remaining neutral. # Look, the blue heavens shows a laughing face # but I know for sure that you alone are my heaven. # I'd like so much to set ahead the hands of the clock # so that our reunion wouldn't be so far away. # Come and bring me happiness soon, # every moment lost would be a pity! # If you don't come, the roses will have bloomed in vain # If you don't come, the larks will have sung their songs in vain. # Time is moving slowly, and I can't find rest, # because today I have my most beautiful rendezvous. # If you don't come, all my yearning will be in vain, # if you don't come, what should be the purpose of my life? # Many a night I have wasted without you. # If you don't come, I will have dreamed in vain. Manicure again? Ah, head massage. Your head is aching? No wonder at this time of day. Miss Grete will be there in about one hour. No, at once, please, it's very urgent. I'll send the car to fetch Miss Grete at once. Come quickly, miss. Please be quiet.. Just in case, I brought all my things for a manicure. You won't need them, only a head massage is needed. Hey, Hans! If you make such a face the whole ironed suit will be useless. Ah, it's no use. Somehow she found out in Sanssouci,and so she didn't bother to come yesterday. Please, do the massage rather thoroughly. And detain my father in his room as long as possible. I'm expecting a visitor. And she won't receive me either. Listen, don't dare to back out! I've forty minutes left of my break, I'll take you there. Just to make sure. Hans, you behave as if you were to go to the dentist. Herr Director has surely caught a cold! No, I'm nervous. I have worries, worries, my dear child. I'm waiting... well, with that damned noise you can't hear the doorbell! Please, Miss Grete, pay some attention to the doorbell. Didn't the bell ring? No, I didn't hear anything. Herr Director seems to be very nervous today indeed. Anna! - Yes, mademoiselle? Anna, if it's Herr Meyer, let him wait in the parlour. But if it's a young blond man, then very quietly lead him upstairs to me. Do you understand, very quietly, so that daddy won't notice. I'll do that, mademoiselle, I'll do that. Ah, welcome, Herr Meyer! Wouldn't you like to sit down in the parlour, Herr Meyer? So... if you please, Herr Meyer. Just stop that ole machine, use your fingers, it's much nicer. If you're so impatient, Herr Director, the massage won't be of any help. Well, it's no wonder. Have you ever waited for your future son-in-law? Ah, you're waiting for your son-in-law? What does he look like? I don't know. I only know his bank account. Ring the bell! So ring the bell! One has to make short shrift with you! Tell me if the bell rings, Miss Grete, yes? Of course, of course! Now hurry up! Mademoiselle is already waiting for you! And make it quietly! The director general mustn't hear anything! Quietly! Here, around the corner! I knew that somebody has arrived! - Herr Director! Ah, I'm very pleased to meet you! My pleasure! The gentleman wanted to speak with mademoiselle immediately, and so I led him in straight away. How should I have known that Herr Kr?ger didn't want me to. It's very nice to meet you in person. I heard much about you, my daughter has told me a lot about you. Really? - Oh yes. That's really nice of your daughter. Come, come, we have a lot to talk about. Or do you want to talk with my daughter first? Fair enough, then talk with my daughter. Perhaps it's better if I announce you first? My daughter is a little nervous, you know. Really? She has always been so calm and charming until now. I'm glad that you have such a good opinion about my daughter. Everything will work out fine, then. Honestly, I had the same feeling. Well then, just sit down here. It will take a little while. Yes, please? - I'd like to see Miss Kr?ger. I don't think that's possible now. Excuse me, didn't mademoiselle leave a message? No, no, everything's settled already. The last thing we need... Pardon, I didn't know that someone is in this room. A 'kuckuck'? A bailiff's seal? I see. May I help you? Pardon me if I ask you again. Can I do anything for you? - No, thanks. Perhaps you allow me to take you somewhere in my car? If you could take me to my shop. If you've been crying, people always stare at you in the tram. With pleasure. Perhaps it's better if I try myself? Yes, that would be quite all right. Have a try. Yes, step in. Herr Meyer? I don't have much time, Herr Meyer. Hurry up then, Herr Meyer. Ah, please excuse me. I only wanted to see Miss Kr?ger. But what are you doing here? But you are... Tell me, aren't you from the Caf? Victoria? Yes...no... I'm from the night club Casanova. I only work in the Victoria as a relief waiter. But who sent you in, for heavens sake? The director general, I think. I see... well... And what do you want? I want... I'd like to... Excuse me, I'd like to see Miss Kr?ger. Well then, get started. What do you have to tell me? So you are... Pardon... excuse me... Do you perhaps have a sister? If you gave me your address I could write to you. It's really no use. Gentlemen's salon to the left, please. - Pardon... May I ask you for a little favour? - Yes, sir. Could you give me the address of the young lady? Sorry, that's impossible on principle. - Too bad. Is that a good perfume up there? No no, the large one here. It's a real occasion. It costs 90 marks, but I would gladly give it to you for 81. That's a real steal. I'll take it straight away. Or, wait: please send it to me. With pleasure. To which address? To the address you didn't want to give me. I didn't want to give you the address? Hurry, Grete. The little fat one from Frankfurt am Main is waiting for you. Yes, one moment. But where do I have my... The bag, I'll bring her the bag at once. I can't tell you how thankful I am that she's a manicurist. You know, a waiter and a manicurist, that's a totally different affair. I have to give you my hand. - Don't mention it. It's the most beautiful day of my life! And I've really come to love this place. Well, then please return soon! With pleasure, and, if I can be of any help to you sometime... You know, the affair with that Meyer... You can count on me, miss. One moment...here... Night club Casanova. You only have to give them a call, you only got to phone. I am going to help you, so that you don't have to marry the bank. Really, that your old man took me for that Meyer! This is the most beautiful day of my life! Pardon, please excuse me. This is the most beautiful day of my life! Missy, don't put on such a grumpy face. Professor, I'm working. Manicure? - No, thank you. I'd like to wait for Miss Grete. She forgot her bag. Ah, give it to me. - Hey, miss... Look, your bag. Who is it? - He's waiting for you. So, goodbye, miss. - But we haven't finished yet. It's all right. Goodbye, then. Erna, I don't feel well. What's the matter? You can't do that stunt yet again today. But today it's really... It will pass. Just start, two days ago you quickly felt well again, too. Why so serious, Miss Grete? May I ask for your hand? I hope you don't feel uncomfortable because of me coming here. I only wanted to tell you... ... how happy I am. This not the right place for private conversations, But there's one thing I want to tell you since you started it anyway. Believe me or not: I wanted to tell you everything yesterday. I was firmly resolved to explain to you that I'm a manicurist, and not... not a lady, as you thought. Yes, but what's the problem? I like it much better this way. I wanted to explain something, too. - The other hand, please. You don't have to explain anything to me, it's superfluous. I'm fully in the know. Ah... but how? Has someone told you something about me? Or has someone seen me? That's really the ultimate tastelessness. To come here and humiliate me this way! Well well, humiliate! That's a rather harsh way of putting it. Why are you so angry? One can do anything to a manicurist. You can let her stand and wait in the rain. Ah, that's what you mean! No, Miss Grete, I didn't stand you up, I was there. Only a little later, I wasn't able to make it in time, that can happen, no? Don't bother! You don't believe me. Listen, Grete. I don't want something like this to happen again. Here, you can reach me by this number every night. Thank you, I have no need for it. - You never know, please take it. Why are you so unfriendly today? - Put away your hands! But what do you have against me? You even ask? - Yes. What's the matter? You find it quite all right to date one woman and get engaged with another? Get engaged? I? Now I'm curious: with whom? If you want to know exactly: Miss Gertrud Kr?ger. Stop it, please. But Grete... Grete, that's all nonsense. You can tell that to somebody else. Take off your hands. Grete, dear Grete, please be sensible. What was that? If you believe that I have to put up with everything here... What does that mean, Grete? - It was only a joke.... I'm very sorry and will bring you another girl at once. But why? Miss Grete may easily finish the job. Erna! It's really impossible of you. - Pardon me, my nerves are... Ah, rubbish! Will you follow me, yes? Yes, sir? Your hand, please. Say, Miss Grete won't be fired? You only think of your amusement and of adventures! Keep your mouth shut, everyone in the shop knows it. To come here with a car and be taken home by all sorts of gentlemen, and accepting gifts and perfume, that's all you're good for. What is it, sir? - What an idiot I am! 2 marks and 50 pfennigs, sir! What is it? - 2 marks and 50 pfennigs. 2 marks and 50 pfennigs on top of it. - Many thanks. You can fetch your papers later at the desk. Now it's really like in the cinema here! In our time one would have been ashamed to accept so many gifts. That evening dress alone! That Herr Meyer must have a sinful amount of money. The price sticker is still on the bottle - 81 marks. "Know'st thou this phial, Brackenburg?" Can you still see that I cried, Frau Seidelbast? Too bad, every time I've just powdered myself, something like this comes up. It's only because of this music. This music is to blame for everything! Oh, keep it playing. The music is good, it get's me in the mood. I warn you. "My Gretchen, see! still young thou art, and not the least bit shrewd or smart." But what could happen to me? I once want to be happy, too, I once want to go out, too, I once want to see the world, too. There are people who go out every night. "Every night" he said, Frau Seidelbast. Here, by night at the Casanova. - Who, the major? Ah, who talks of Meyer? I once want to forget everything, too! To be happy once, just once! I understand. Like in the cinema. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema... # and see the fine people in the film # I think again and again: # If I could only once, just once, be as happy as them. Don't drink so much, man! Today I have to drink! Because she called it off. Are you looking for someone, Miss Grete? # On the 75-pfennig-seat # I'm yearning for a lovely sweetheart # who, like in the film, must make me happy finally. # On Sundays, when I go to my cinema # and see the world through rose-coloured glasses, # I still dream on Monday morning: # "To live like them just once!"; but one never gets it done. Say, waiter, is this the only room with table service? Yes, madame. I see. Tell me, aren't there any separ?es here where you cannot be seen? But nobody can see us here, either. Yes... yes... I'm very happy that I for once can do you a favour, Miss Kr?ger. Your father will be very astonished. He really can't force you to marry a man who goes out with other women. That's really terribly kind of you. Thanks a lot. Goodbye. Anna, is the director general in? - Yes, mademoiselle. Daddy! What's the matter with you this evening, Hans? Hurry, tray for four persons, table 7. But then... then everything's fine. Pardon? I only thought about something. I see. I'm really very glad that we're here. I couldn't think of anything better, either. Table 9? Give it to me, that's my table. Allow me, madame. Are you pleased with the lobster, madame? Fresh from Helgoland, madame. Butter and mayonnaise, madame? Thanks. As you wish, madame. Please tell the waiter that I'm not married. I'm terribly sorry, madame. Pardon, mademoiselle. Waiter! - Yes, madame? Yes, please? - You forgot the mayonnaise. Pardon, madame. There you are, madame. Waiter! Waiter! - Yes, madame? Yes, please? - I dropped my fork. I'll immediately get a new one, madame. Waiter! Heavens! - What are you doing? It's your fault obviously. Waiter! Waiter! I'm exceedingly sorry about this disturbance, madame, something like this of course is not supposed to happen. But why, these things can happen. He really waited on us excellently, didn't he? Yes, yes. Thank you very much. Why do you send the waiter away? Now he'll surely dismiss the other one. At least you should have said that you will make up for the damage. Then we simply eat a little less. Well, if it's so important for you, my dear... I told you that you shouldn't drink so much. Drinking causes the greatest nonsense. - I don't care at all. Waiter, I only want to tell you that of course I will make up for the damage. Please don't dismiss those people. Ah, that's delightful! Now I understand why my daughter sent me here! Ah, Director.... No wonder that you have headaches in the morning if you go out this late in the evening. No, no, don't say anything against my headaches! I only get them so that you can give me a massage. There comes my gallant. Excuse me, we are old acquaintances. Please keep your seat. I consider it a matter of decency to apologize personally to the lady. Why apologize? To that one? Out of the question. Just come now. I'd rather get fired, you can tell her that! Excuse me, I wanted to thank madame very much for the friendly intercession. In the name of my colleague, too. Why doesn't he come himself? Unfortunately, he is not quite well. Excuse me, please. But where are you going? Hans! What is it? Hans, are you not well? What is it? What do you want from me? But Hans, now everything's fine. You know who I am and I know who you are. Fine? Fine isn't the right word here. You know that I'm a waiter and nothing else. But I also know what you are, unfortunately. Well, that's not exactly nice. But Hans, what do you mean? Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I don't use my eyes? The dress you're wearing costs some money. And you're not treated to champagne for nothing, are you? But Hans, please don't... Don't bother, miss. Not with me, no! Salad, table 7. The other way please, miss. Please, would you give me my coat? Fabulous! Go on. If I told you that I well-nigh married the daughter if that old fool hadn't kept me seated and waiting for so long. That old fool, that's brilliant! But when our little friend, Miss Grete, ran out of the room so quickly, the carpet was turned over, and what shall I tell you - a 'kuckuck'! Pardon? Oh, you don't understand - a bailiff's seal! Oh, really. Isn't that funny? The lady asked me to tell you that she's waiting downstairs in the car. Good evening, Director General. Ah, Herr.... Herr Meyer! But what are you doing here, Herr Meyer? No, no, I'm not Meyer. The one over there with whom you sat at the table, that's Herr Meyer. So I was that old fool! That's very kind of you, miss, that you left that Meyer for my sake. Since when do you call me 'miss', daddy? Well, I say. So you wanted to throw me off my guard. Daddy, I want to ask you something. Won't you like to talk with Wolf for five minutes? Now you'd have some time. Well, you apparently take me for an old fool, too. Wolf, come in. Good evening, Herr Kr?ger. Good evening, Herr Wolf. Daddy, you can simply call him Wolf. There's an end to Meyer! Waiter, can you tell me where the lady has gone that shared the table with me? The lady? Is she gone? Perhaps she ran away from you. - Beg your pardon? Herr Meyer, calm down, she's deceiving both of us. What impertinence! See that you get away, or you'll indeed get fired in the end. No. 37, here we are. Thanks a lot, officer. So get in. Officer, actually you'd have to arrest me. I'm a criminal, you must know. You must know, I insulted a lady. Well, go now, go to bed. Officer! Officer! Couldn't you also lock the door? Good grief, will you go to bed now? Beg your pardon. Who is there? Help! Help! Help, help, Frau Seidelbast! Burglars! Help! Help! What's this? Please, please, please... Is someone here? I sincerely apologize, but I believe I live here. See that you get out! I'll call the police! The police. Too bad. I could have brought them along. Help! Help! - Don't shout so loud. It must be possible to ascertain who owns the bed. That's my bed, do you hear? Don't you hear, that's my bed! Frau Seidel..., Frau Seidel... You? What are you doing here? I? Why? One moment. One moment! Then.. then it was you who always threw my dresses.... Yes, miss... My suit lay in the water yesterday, too. Well, I say! It's your fault that I lost my job! And I even paid 2 marks and 50 for that. Don't be afraid. I only want to make myself presentable. Where are my... Where are my... My... Under the bed. Well, it's not a catastrophe. No reason to get so upset. Just stop crying. Aren't you glad? - No. Why not? I can't. But Grete... Look, isn't it wonderful? You always run after your luck, and finally you realise that all the time you slept with your luck in the same bed. Do you know how that feels? # You came to me, and all my yearning hasn't been in vain. # You came to me, and the larks haven't sung their song in vain. # Many a night that once I wasted without you, # I haven't dreamed entirely in vain.
