THE CRAZY DESIRE Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Bird! Oh, point out to me well, I don't remember. Do not worry sir. Calpurnia ... Calpurnia! Here I am, sir. Take care ... Take care of Antonio's highway when he completes his journey. And you, Antonio ... And you, Antonio! Caesar, my lord ... Antonio, his name is like you. All strong men are called Antonio. Arm. Arm? There is a reflection. We are seen. Arm. Forgives... Worth little like Caesar, huh. Do you think it is a good deal? How much will they earn from this? 11:30? I think enough is enough. Go Go. Let's go to the Senate! Let's go. Yes, we are leaving too. Caesar addresses the Senate! Caesar addresses the Senate! Maybe now it gets interesting. Yes... Who knows what will happen. They give him 23 stabs ... ... not one more, not one less. Next week I am in Rome again. Meanwhile, let's see if you can keep an eye on the accounting ... Of course. They could change these stones. He says they are Roman, ancient. Therefore. It is time to change them. He never wants to go dancing, always to bed. Instead Antonio always wants to go dancing ... ... never once go to bed. To bed early, I say. We must reduce the percentage of coal to 3 per thousand, at least. It will not be easy, there is less loss in electric ovens. Do you go out with Antonio often? When he comes to Rome he always calls me. And you with Carlo? As you live in Rome ... ... never calls me. I had Westinghouse write a letter ... ... they will send a technician to Milan. Do you know what's good about your girlfriend? His girlfriend ... his friend. Tight thighs. And the narrow waist, but with long legs. Congratulations. Have you been offended? Hey? Nerd... It seemed to me . They have killed Caesar! It's just that, Alberghetti ... You do n't want to marry her, do you? Bah, something had in mind. Listen, Alberghetti: don't get married. Never put the woman on a sentimental level. Always horizontal, like me. Look at me with Silvana. A classy woman, huh. All a lady. Buy the clothes in Paris. In fact, I met her on the plane, back from Paris ... ... after the phosphate symposium. I look at her, she plays dry. If the woman is dry, it means that she is receptive ... if not, it is indifferent. Classic approach, with magazine. Read "Epoca", so it will be a lady, maybe a model. The little window. There's nothing to see... ... so if she looks a lot, it means she's receptive. Look, but not much, and he takes my arm off. "Pardon". We try again. Photography. I choose any photo, insignificant ... It's interesting. He does not remove my arm. And two days later ... And now we see each other very often, when I go down to Rome. I have put him an apartment in Via Giulia. But the site is mine. So by the way I invest. But nothing else, at the class level. As the Neapolitans say: "You give me something ..." "... and I another to you." I don't know if you understand me. Oh, it's leaking. It's time for the Chachachá! Do you never get tired? I am of Romano blood, we are of iron. For me, 4 hours of sleep is more than enough. Listen, you have to stop this 4 hour sleep story. You are a man like everyone else ... ... you need to sleep 8 hours a night, and half an hour after eating. The shoe... All to the Brigadun! You too, Silvana. Awake! We will dance all night. But remember that tomorrow you have a hard day. But how hard! Just get organized ... At 75 km / h, I leave Rome at 9. At noon I am in Girarrosto ... ... I arrive in Pisa at 3, I pick up my son at school ... ... visit to the leaning tower, ice cream, return at 4 ... ... at 9 am I am in Corso Lodi. It's a walk ... And watch out for the sympathy. Now also the tires? To control the pressure. Put the triangle! Teddy boys! Burned youth, failed generation ... Crazy kids, and even crazier parents. But that it does? She's crazy? No, you are an unconscious ... Maybe she's fed up with life ... Yes! Ah, there are the crazy people who almost ran me over. Now you almost run me over. Gentle, right? Children, you want to play. But not me. Well what do they do? Do they want to separate, yes or no? And good? How is it? Like a bidet, right? ... Rather ... Yeah, a 2.5 million bidet. Well, 2 million more. And also, after each acceleration you have to fix the engine. You believe? So what would you say to me if I told you that I am a distinguished member of the ACI Automobile Club? Would you say: "A c?" And since I am a member of the ICA ... unfortunately I must help road users, and be patient. But not too much. Let's see what happens. Oh, and I thought you had stopped for my pretty face. What happens to this death trap? Has the engine been damaged? No, the engine is fine, it is gasoline. Everything has its remedy, except death. Give me a container. Here it is... No, that little one is enough. No, this one better. Ahead. Suck, suck. It's super. Super suck. He saw? Excuse me. Now you will see how it runs, excellence. Come on let's go. Come ... come! I use you because the "you" tires me, okay? Poor ... Come on, let's move on. You must have a terrible mouth, now I give you something to remove the taste. Picnic? No, unfortunately I'm on a business trip. No, the chocolate! Ah! I had believed ... thank you. Ignore them, they are terrific. Yes, stranded ... in love. What are you staring at? I am not wearing anything underneath? Well, I have a dress. Dirty old man! Do you think it will be enough? Follow. Ah, good ... Too much? Why aren't lighters refilled in the process? You know, it's not to be stranded again, sir. I am not a gentleman. But he is a distinguished member. Do not leave me... Thank you. You are welcome sir. You're welcome. Bye Bye. Good trip. It has stained all our pans and pots. Bye. Bye. "I have a dress, I don't ..." And what do I care? Were we like that at that age? Not me, that's for sure. And what else gives a little iodine in the lungs. "Strained"? I used to send them to the tail of the mines . Crazy criminals! And I who have helped them. I'm going to write to Zaccagnini! Come on, Francesca, come to the party. Come on, leave Piero, come here! Come! I want to go with Rico, you have exhausted me. The door! Jump, I take you in my arms! One, two ... Here I come! My love, have you suffered a lot without me? Yes, love, a lot, a lot. I did nothing but sleep. Oh, that is love. What monkeys. Flavio, give me your hand. Ey! Please! Apologies. I am a member of the ICA. Have you seen what crazy? They pass me on the right ... ... women change from one car to the other, I don't know ... I'm going to write to Zaccagnini, you know! The use of acoustic signals is prohibited here , you have repeatedly honked your horn, therefore you are penalized. Perhaps you have not understood me, I am a member of the ICA ... Papers. This is our last weekend. It's getting cold. Hopefully! I'm sick of bathing. Oh, my little skin ... "Another winter will return ..." Well, I would like to be in Nairobi. What do you sing? The anthem of the SS Sorry, but you could have eaten something, right? Are you feeling better already? No, what anger. I wanted the supplì. Shame they don't have it. What are we, in the Congo? I don't know, really ... I would tell Mattei. You come with me. We wait for Rico who must pay, right? It will not pay. Let's go. What's going on? Nothing, a joke on Rico. I'll explain later. Let's go. That it is late. I'm leaving! Track! Bill. Everything? Clear. 2 thousand lire. Ah! How prices have dropped ... Gas? Super. Those hands! Now my friends are coming. No, they are already gone. Ah ... Oh! But that it does? To the thief! Stop it! Grab it! What reflections, huh. Help! Come on! OMG! It does not move. It has hit the head. If he's dead! It was you. What do I have to do? Yes, you have thrown the broom. I was just doing my duty. They were yelling "the thief" so I intervened. I have good reflexes, I am an engineer. He killed him ... Let's not talk nonsense. I have never killed anyone! Cheer up, guys. There we will find a drink. And also to eat. An English shooter, how did you get to see it? Nice shot, lieutenant. I'm proud of you, Mr. Lieutenant. What a shame. Unconscious. For 2 thousand lire. What do I care about 2,000 lire? Well then you don't shout "the thief"! Does it move! He has opened his eyes. Do not swirl, take a breath. Help me. Ah, dad. Is it you, dad? Come on, help me! But that it does? Let's get him in the car. I take him to the hospital. And the 2,000 lire? I pay. It was an accident. You fainted. You alone, understand? Alone. What do you do? How can I tell you? It was a disgrace! Is not my bussiness. What do you want of me? On the right. Do I have to turn? Okay, I'll turn. Slowly. Do you want to go slow? Okay, slow. Brake. Do you want me to stop? All right, brake. So. Thanks for the ride, engineer! And for the 2,000, of course. What are you doing, engineer? Calm down! Stop, scoundrel ... He has no sense of humor! ... Stop! What does? Won't you accept the joke? If it's for the 2,000 lire, I can return it to you, and with interest. Rico, what are you doing? Are you bringing the police behind you? Hey guys, this one won't take the joke! For! Is he a cop? Sure, he has a mustache. Hey, you fill me with sand. Come here! Come Rico, let's go out to sea! I'm going there! He loves me, he has followed me! Have you paid the bill? Come too. A good dive! ¡Sal fuera! A la "dolce vita"! No, Rico! Look how hot the water is! I always book ... ... thanks to the "partner". Come back, if you have courage! Deficient! Excellency, where are you going? Come back! Too bad, he was nice. What does? Are you leaving us already? Bye! See you, sir! Bye! Thanks for the account and the trip! What? Do you want some celery? No not like that. Voilà, I knew it. No, not the cat. I shit on ...! Are you angry? Do like me: I never get angry. I have already understood everything about life. Do you know when serious problems happen to you , like committing suicide? Well, if I can fix them, I fix them , and if not, I sleep. Total, if they have no remedy, why be angry? Don't you think? What do you want to understand at your age? Why? How old do you make me? 14. Oh yeah? And why not 10, as you are? Unfriendly. 16 ... in November. Have some celery, it will calm you down. There's a phone? Imagine, there is no light. There will be a people. Yes, two hours by donkey. But there is no donkey. A bicycle? No. Ah, but there is a jumper. You know? But I have to get to school before night. Well, why don't you ask them for help ? Who, those clowns? Yes. The blonde first becomes deficient, and then ... Rico always does this when he's in trouble ... Sooner or later he'll end up in jail. He even did it when they went to recruit. And so? They wanted him as an engineer. When you laugh, you look 10 years younger. How many? Like forty. Well, when I'm serious. No, when you laugh. I am 39. But hey, don't you realize that I don't like celery? And that? I don't either, it disgusts me. And why do you eat it? As I am already 6 meters tall, celery slows my growth. Who has put that nonsense in your head? One who used to court me is now Luchino's assistant. Okay, I give up. Come on, give them a call. No, not now. Now they are bathing. Ah! Are you good at cooking? Cooking? Yes! You are crazy? Come. Where are you taking me? Wait! Come. Where are you taking me? Are you crazy? You wet me whole! Should they be in the water for a long time ? 24 hours. What? Yes, that's how the bad smell goes away, right? What are you talking about? From the onions. No, I was talking about those bastards. Do you have a lot of bathroom left? Why? Are you already tired of being with me? No, what does it have to do with it. Unfortunately, I have things to do. Tell me, what do you do? Wait I guess. Well, you have a Spyder and an old bidet. You are 40 years old. 39, please. And it has ... a good store! No, I am an engineer. Antonio Berlingheri, electromechanical engineer. Engineer? Yes. You are a dragon! I am a denial of mathematics. Hey, Tonino, how do you cut the peppers? In the width, in the length? Why do you eat them raw? Yes, because they are tastier. Good. Tuna, olives, anchovies, mustard ... ... celery, celery ... here it is. Celery, onions, goat cheese ... What do you think is missing? Peppers. Oh yeah. Everything is there, right? If all. Why don't we add a little more mustard? Total, I'm not going to eat it. You will eat it and digest it yourself. Do you all live here together? Bah, not even that we smelled bad. Come, help me set the table. I got out of the water first, so I have to do everything. Why, were you cold? No, but he broke his swimsuit on a rock. Come on, help me a little. And my butt came off. But how the hell do you talk? Ah, have you noticed? Yes, I know, seseo. Sassolino de Sassari. Do I look good to you in the kitchen? Will you marry me? What? I asked you if you would marry me. Me? The 3 per thousand, you understand? My wife. It is understood? A loss of 3 per thousand. Yes Yes. Of the rest, just examine here. What are you laughing at? Won't you marry me Yes, of course, of course. And we're going on our honeymoon to Disneyland. You take me for a girl, huh. You are 15 years old. 16. One and six. Close your eyes. So. I'm a lady ... Total, you don't like girls. Come on, close your eyes. Close them! Good... An old woman of those that you frequent, about 26, 28 years old. Don't you smell my perfume in the room? Yes, onion. Stop kidding me, it makes me mad. So, our secret date ... I cheat on my husband, I'm platinum blonde ... ... I take off my fur coat, my veil ... The veil? Yes, at my age ... I advance mysterious and sinful, I take off my gloves. I come closer to you, hug me, kiss me , I'm yours ... Hold me, kiss me! What do you feel? Nothing in particular. Oh, thank goodness. So it's not ... No, it's not. This is Piero, do you know Piero? Pleasure. Wait guys. I want to introduce you to Mr. Berlingheri. To eat! Hello guys. The engineer Antonio. Ah, "Dr. Antonio"! A soap opera. Do you work on TV? No, its not me. Will you eat something today? Me permite, Berling ... If how? My love! Is the table ready? I do not eat. No, you eat. I don't feel like it, I don't eat. You eat! I have made a salad that goes crazy. The engineer has helped me. Delighted, Berlingheri ... When do you change your boyfriend? That carries? The doctor has told me to be careful with carbohydrates. Put arsenic on his plate. Leave it alone! It's all very healthy: potatoes, onions, radishes, anchovies ... ... goat cheese, olives and peppers, all healthy stuff. And you also know that in summer ... we will go from here directly to the hospital ... Good?! Listen, when someone older at least in age, greets, responds ... ... and introduces himself. This is how it is done in my town. Ah, but you always get angry! Okay, I'll introduce myself. Oh ... Sammy Davis Senior. Charmed. Yes, Sammy Davis has a white father. It's me. That I taught him everything. I understand. Bravo. You don't like young people today, huh? Not too much. You are against youth. And you yourself must have been young, and who knows what hooligan ... Yes, but it's been so long ... Well, shut up! The engineer helped us this morning on the road ... ... we take all the gasoline ... ... and now he has the car stuck in the sand, we have to help him. Cheer up, guys, let's go. Thank you. Oh no... Speaking of drinking, how are we on whiskey? We are in reserve, we must put the brakes. Has heard? We consume little ... let's say 3 liters. I get it. Is this enough? Come on, let's go! He wants to offend us, do we have an accattones face? From Pasolini? We help you get the car out ... ... you go to town for whiskey ... ... and we all drink it together like good friends, huh? So. It is understood? Okay, let's go. The advantages of friendship. Who have a friend, have a treasure. Is it heavy, engineer? Calm Calm. Can you buy me a package of Marlboro? Another for me. It's okay. See if you can find that Diamonds record ... Shut up! The new! Yes Yes... For me two packages from Kent and also Annabella. Annabella for me too. For me a blonde girl! Come on cheer up. So goodbye. Don't forget, make her pretty! Also whiskey! It is understood. Yes, wait for the whiskey. Poor fools, who's coming back? "And my butt came out ..." But what a way to speak! How do I pronounce the S's? Yes sir! Sassolino of Sassari! Sequentially! Well, I have it perfect. Where do you come from? We kept you company, Tonino, if you don't get bored. I've even heard you speak to yourself. Ah, you don't trust it, huh? No. Are we wrong? What do I know! We also have to help you choose the whiskey, ... if not, who knows what brand you choose, Besides, I had to kiss Piero. Right, Piero? Engineer, I beg you, put on some music, otherwise I die. At your orders. Hey, this travels incognito! The Great White Feather Chief! What do you do? Put those feathers away right away. Have you heard? I am Moonbeam, your squaw! Save those feathers! Do you want to save it? It is a gift for my son. I have to take it to school. And I'm also late, damn it. You have a son? Then you are married. No, I am separated. And are you not ashamed of having a poor child locked up in a school? My son is very happy. I have already placed him, there is my rascal. The 2nd of the 3rd row. No, it's the 3rd in the 2nd row. Ah, right. They are dressed the same, they get confused. Berlingheri! Yes, mother. Hello, Maurizio. Your father. Yes, mother. You can give your father a kiss . How are you? Well the food is great, I study hard ... ... and in my free time I play with the ball. Okay, so next time I'll bring you a good ball. Oh yeah, dad. Thank you. We will do a little play shortly, and he will be Black Cloud. He is an Indian chief, converted by the missionaries whose head is cut off. The little one would need a costume or even a Tomahawk. A...? It is an Indian ax. Ah yes, certainly. I'll bring you a nice Indian hat, with all the feathers. Thanks Dad. Can I give you a kiss? Clear. Bye, Maurizio, be good. Go Berlingheri. But what is a 9-year-old going to know if he is happy or not? Hey! Stop! Enough, right? Hey, look at the road! Do you want? Is it for your girl? Hey? Nerd. I was looking more than anything. Please... Excuse me, are you resistant from behind? Oh, guaranteed. Only panties? How do you say? I mean just panties or bra too? Oh, Tonino, what love! Can you buy me the suit? Let's see... No, this one is monstrous, this one doesn't exist, this one is the plague. Let's see ... Let's see ... but what disgusting. East! This is not bad at all. You think? It's the least gross. Taking into account the rest. You like? Say how does it fit me? Do you like it, eh, Tonino? Thank you. Look what Tonino bought me! The bra too, the better. Yes... How much is it? 9 thousand. God, what a late. I'll leave it all here. Whiskey, the bathing suit ... I risk finding myself closed to school. OMG what a dream! How hard is the back seat. I have a square butt. Did that shirt come from the dry cleaners? Why? It is all shrunken in the belly. What do you do? Drive, drive! Follow the curves, right? Yes, follow her ... ¡140! An exceptional car, superlative performance. It reaches 185km / h with an ease ... I'm not interested. In principle, I never exceed 100km / h. ¡150! James Dean died at this speed. How handsome! ILLUSTRIOUS MILANESE ENGINEER STARTS WITH HIS SPYDER Mayor's condolences But the mayor ... You can slow down, Tony, we've arrived. Gee, how long it took you. What are you going to do. The engineer drives cautiously. ¡Francesca! Let's go. Did you bring me the Marlboros? Did you buy me "Annabella"? And my blonde girl? And the Kents? Have. Thank you. Oh, it's little food. Enjoy your meal! Flavio, can you pass me the bread? Do we eat in bed? Sit down, Tonino, eat. Yes, but only 5 minutes. How spicy! But I am hungry. Logical, with that race ... Come on ... I don't feel like it. A little. I don't feel like it! Ah, eat a little. Okay, a little bit. Mustard, please! On the fly ... Received! It's good! Above all, cool. Come on, eat! You know, natural things are always the best, right? Maria Grazia, can I have some bread? Bravo, bravo, bravo Antonio. May I know what you want? Peppers? You know you have gastritis. Me? You have it. They tease you, you don't realize it, idiot! You will be an idiot, they like me very much. Come on, you stay because you like the girl. Who? Francesca "Unoseis"? I do not think. And why are you making him drink? Because he is thirsty. And in the car? Leg? That naked belly? Indifferent. You will know that I am used to other tummies. Listen, Antonio ... Tonino. My name is Tonino. What's more, Tony. Antonio is you! What are you doing, Tonino, are you sleeping? No, what to sleep. Are you kidding? Oh I do. As soon as I sit at the table, I lose my appetite and sleep comes to me. Then I go to bed and do not sleep because my appetite has come. Who knows what I'll have ... Eating is boring. One day you will remember the true joys: good food, for example. Do you know that there are primitive peoples ... ... for those who eat is disgusting, a shame? No ... Yes! And they hide to eat. Instead, in the sunlight, they do things of which we are ashamed. And they call them primitive! I will be traditional, but certain things, for example love ... ... I prefer to do it without prying eyes. Not like those two for example. Are they at least engaged? Yeah sure. Him with his cousin ... ... and she with a boy who is doing military service in Pavia. Toto and Tata, contemporaries. The engineer watches you. And it deplores you. Excuse me, instead of regretting ... ... why don't you shave that mustache? Do you know that someone with a mustache has little ... "Personality ... Personality ..." What personality? So Stalin? Or Hitler. Buff, always talking about Stalin and Hitler. Let's talk a bit about Sinatra. There are also hygienic reasons: the mustache, for example ... ... retains sweat in summer and cold germs in winter. Do you know that you are a poet? What do you say, do you like them? Maybe in you, I would remove it. Don't you think you'd be better off without it? Buff. I told you I only admit platonic love. It's time to get a little platonic, right? No, rather, no. Sorry, but if someone did the same with your sister, what would you say? I do not care. Oh well... Marina, what do you always write? The newspaper? No, the sins. What sins? Mine. As I am incredibly careless ... ... sometimes experiences happen to me, and then when I go to confession ... ... I don't remember anything anymore. So if something happens to me ... ... I write it all down, at least I remember. Comfortable, no? And the china? Shouldn't he come with Gibì? She will not come, but if she should come make it clear to you that you should leave her alone. The china is mine. How yours? I met her first. Anyway, he really likes me, he told me. Do you want to stop? Saint Francesca ... Calm down, if the Chinese only likes me. That's enough! Ridiculous! Anyway, it's not coming. Do you know the joke about the vampire family? No. A joke? Let's listen... Well, Dracula says to his son: "Baby boy, drink the soup, it will coagulate." Sorry but what disgusting. Listen guys, if you allow me, I'll tell you one ... ... but it has a flaw: it 's clean. Well, how was it ... Alberghetti! Please. Do you know the one with the jam? No, no, say. Is very good. A man walks into the grocery store and says: "Give me a jar of Arrayas jam ." "Sorry, we don't have stripes, just plain." That good! A man enters the grocery store and asks for jam. The shopkeeper responds: "Sorry, we only have mullet." No, I was wrong. I forgot the most important thing. A man goes to the grocery store and asks for a jar of Arrayas jam. The shopkeeper replies: "We don't have stripes, we have plaid." What does it have to do? Nerd. Ignore me. A man asks for a jar of Arrayas jam ... ... the shopkeeper answers ... Yes! The shopkeeper replied: "We don't have stripes ..." A man goes to the grocery store and asks: "Please, do you have a jar of Arrayas jam?" "No", replies the shopkeeper, "We don't have stripes, we have plaid." "¡La tenemos lisa" ¡Lisa! Come on, really? It is awful. And old. This was told to Geoffroi de Bouillon ... ... and he decided to go to the crusades and never came back. Everybody out, come on! Francesca, I'm going. Wait a minute, do you want to see the swimsuit you bought me? Oh cheeky! Malicious! Bah, very skinny, you can see her ribs, A herring, a sardine. How does it fit me, do you like it? What do you say? It seems a bit wide to me here, doesn't it? Width? A little. Where? Anyway, with water it shrinks. Francesca. Where are you going? Out with the others. No, stay here, a little with me. But weren't you in a hurry? Nerd. I will not rush. And besides, you already saw, right? With my car I can go 160 km / h. Ah well then ... Shall we put on some music? How the hell does this thing work? There, when it gets to this point, I want to cry. And because? I like to die. I like you a lot too, Francesca. You are pretty, you are desirable ... I like you. I'm a monster. I have a dandy face . At most, yes. How is my language? Beautiful, everything is beautiful in you. You are extraordinary. What are you laughing at? Tonino, your eyes have turned. You want to stop, girl! Who do you take me for? First you provoke me and then ... what do you think I am, one of those little kids? I'm a man. Come here. Come here. Ah! I shit on my cigarette! Oh poor Tonino, have you hurt yourself? No. You fur, Francesca ... Cine. Your hair ... Cinema. Who. But what am I doing here? 10 thousand lire the bathing suit ... Gasoline, motel bill, 10,000 lire of whiskey ... ... that I haven't even drunk. In fact, I'm going to drink now. I am throwing away a lot of money. I get out of here. One step forward, if you're not out of focus. Rico, Veniero, take her in your arms. Come on, hurry! Take her by the legs. That's OK? Quick. Come on, higher. That's good. Let's go! More sensual, moisten your lips. Completely denied, don't you think? Terrible actors. Marina is a plant. Guys, the engineer is leaving! Go for the engineer! Engineer? The departure for the Crusades ... Engineer, go "bye bye" with your little hand. Let's make the engineer come out in the love scene. Come on engineer, let's make it quick! Come on! Leave me. With that face? However Tonino can please. Yeah sure. Horrendous is not, but ... It has something of Marlon Brando. Thank you ... Yes, the shoes! Get ready for the love scene let's go! Marina and Marlon Brando! Will you leave me alone, please? Let me ... Roll on the sand. As in "From here to eternity." No, I do. No, I want to do it. I do the love scene. Yes, it's better Francesca. Leave it, Marina, we'll make it later. Come on, Francesca, my soul, you look like a puppet. Veniero, give that cane to the engineer ... ... with which he whips Francesca, she surrenders and kisses him. Yes, I give it to you, but you need a birch bouquet. Why? I practice whipping a lot ... ... and is whipped only with birch branches. Go to the nursing home, you ... Everyone off the field! Engineer, whip Francesca. You down. Are you kidding me guys? Yes, hit it hard! Outside! Outside! Ready? Come on, him! Watch out! Stronger! No, stronger! I want to see the hate! Stop his arm, imploring! More ruthless, engineer! Taking! You suffer, unbearable pain! A shout! Stop, be still! Now kiss. Kiss, kiss ... Ah, like this. Bravo Bravo! Movie over, damn it! This scene does not pass the censorship. Bathroom. Bath, to purify! Tonino, come to the water too, let's go. Yes, to the water after eating, with all those peppers in the stomach. And the swimsuit? Inside, there are thousands! Who has invented this mania of bathing? Beware Veniero! The virgin ...! It's frozen! Come, Tonino! Let's go! I go. Wait. We are at 50 below zero! Engineer, you know that being wet helps you ! And with bangs! Look at the engineer with the bangs! Like Cleopatra! It looks like a whale! Let's see how you swim, let's go. More like a walrus, with that mustache. Look at the engineer, miracle, he floats! "The sea takes it ..." Berlingheri, do some knockoffs. Engineer, why don't you imitate the commander a bit? Ladies and gentlemen, I'll do the commander's imitation by peeing. Now notice how the aristocrat swims . Disgusting ... What a profile! Disgusting ... It's a boy. Gross. Gross. That good. And now attention ... No Please! All to the rock! Yes! Go Go! Toto, come! Wait for me Those at 20 meters are exhausted. I go. They do not see! ¿Rico? Oh God, what have I got? I knew ... the peppers. Calm. Inspire, breathe. It's nothing, it's impossible ... But what do I have? Here I drown. Do not panic... Help! Help! Help! I'm drowning, I'm the engineer! Help! Interesting, I've never seen an engineer die. I'm drowning... The ING. BERLINGHERI PERISHES AMONG THE WAVES The irrepressible crying of the President Imagine if it had happened to me. Bah, but it happened to him. But it could have happened to me, right? But it has not happened. But if it had happened to me, what would you have done? What do I know. I just know that for now it hasn't happened to you. Yes, but it could happen ... Come on, out! Quiet, light enters the camera. Now we shoot: "Death of an Engineer". This I send to Venice. Damn, he's not dead! Its alive! Tonino ... Put it back in the water. Why? It's like a horse: if you fall, you must get back on your feet ... ... to overcome fear. You were about to drown. Now you go back to the water ... ... and some good pitches, understand? How? Die! Did you hear the engineer? Give me a hand, let's take him there. It is the cha-cha of the drowned man ... .that to die ... he has sent us What do you do? A very nice step. Very vulgar, it seems to me. No... And in Saint Tropez they all do it. Yes, but here it is vulgar. I swear, I'm sick of this devil life, really. I've tried everything, you know. Women of all races, and ages. I have had sensations of all kinds. And I'm already getting a little frigid. Dona, you have to do me a favor: Show me that you love me. But right now, do you understand? Maybe you can still save me. Tell me yes or no, please. Listen ... Yes? Do you think there will be cheese left in the fridge? You know I've been hungry too. Let's go? We'll see. Yes. Have you ever seen black people dancing? Attention, now I will imitate the engineer. Make us laugh Let's see if I am amused. I'm from Milan, I'm an engineer and I demand respect! Oh God, Bobo, it's not that I'm funny, my appendix is ​​dancing! You are an artist. I will come every night to applaud you. Who gives me fire? Who has a Marlboro? I have Kent, will you? A Marlboro, who has? Do you have fire? Do you have a match? Who has stolen my lighter? Where was it? Where did you find it? He was outside alone, getting wet. Put it in the kitchen, let it dry, if not, it will get cold. And offer him a whiskey. Now let's see if you guess this one ... Sst! Be good, because, right ... Do they have a house? Then go home! Already! Who? Gassman! Do a favor, what speed! So with a half smile I'm not bad. It is true that I am a little chubby. Rather bloated. It's the sea air that makes me feel bad. With fatigue perhaps I have the most interesting look. Are you feeling better, Tonino? Me? I'm fine. Oh la la! You have the face of a cigarette butt. Are you kidding? Baby. It tastes like whiskey! Yes, I have added a little. Get on you, mustachioed saint! "Bigotudo santo... " Francesca makes me laugh with this adult of hers. It makes me a little disgusting. What do you see? He is not ugly. Come on, if it falls apart. He is an Etruscan. Older, from the Ming dynasty. ¡Café! Oh, pretty Francesca ... You look great with blonde highlights. No, I'm terrible, I know. I will not go back to the hairdresser in life. I'll cut it off myself. They spoke of your Northerner. You know it's not that bad. No, not bad ... Poor thing, he's dying for me, what am I going to do? Put the cups in the kitchen, thanks. Francesca! Bye. Francesca! Come sing to us! Will you write me the lyrics later, Marina? Tonino, what have you done? Have you lost your mustache? No, I haven't lost it. I have shaved it. To see your profile. No, you were better before. Put it back on. It is the face that does not go. And the rest. The China! The China! The china is here, the yellow doll! Hi. I will let it grow. Welcome. Hi. Oh, my sister is coming too. Who has come? It is unprecedented in our group. For little, I take care.

Ah, there's also your sister's annoyance . Are you crazy? Hello everyone. Hi, Carla, how are you? The usual ones, huh? If you introduce me to your friends, I'll renew your stock ... I present to you the daughter of the East. Francesca. Haunted. How are you, Francesca? Hello, Gibì. We are passing through, we leave as soon as it stops raining. Gibì is afraid that we will rob the china. Gibì, are you in a hurry? No. Calm down, sit down. Rest for a moment. So. Take off your hat. I'm not tired. But you just arrived, stay with us, right? If not, we can do one thing. You know what? If you really have to go, go. Just leave us to the oriental ... And the other 250 million Chinese? Are they all good like her? Because, in the case, we all go to China. Dance? Do you dance, cha-cha? Let's Dance... We Dance? Listen, Francesca, when can I talk to you? Think of the steps, that you step on me. Forgives. I have to dance the cha-cha with the engineer without fail . ¿Whisky? Tonino, you drink too much! Me? Who do you take me for, one of those rookies? No, jump no, it hurts my spleen. I would like to be a man. A man? And because? That way I would peel myself off and stop worrying. How cool ... but my "matusas" do not want. Matusas, what does matusa mean? Matusas ... Methuselah, parents. How old is your father? Umm ... 41. It's true, almost like you. Then you could be my father. Think how beautiful. Yes Yes. Now it's my turn, right? Thank you. Tell me, do you let them take your women away like that, like nothing? Friend. Up! How the hell do you dance the cha-cha? Content. Listen, sister, lend me 5,000 lire. If it goes well, I'll take the china. What am I going to have? Come on, don't be mean. Tuesday I tell the old men that you go out with me ... and then I let you go wherever you want. Sorry.

Do you like Africa? Tonino ... Yes? You're so silly. Francesca, Franceschina ... I love you! I love you! What a talent to ruin the beautiful moments. And our champion, reaches 5 meters. And now, ready for the endurance final. Please, I can't hear those noises! Engineer, are you not competing? Do me the favor! Where are you going, engineer? What things, crazy things ... Time ... ah! 1 minute and 2 seconds ... Who are you, Berruti? Wild. They are just wild. What's wrong? To work the land, I sent them, pick and shovel to Kenya. And I would learn what it means to live. You know the truth? That everything seems fine to them, everything. You're right. I'm sick of these guys too ... ... they are all the same, tasteless, smooth. Long live the face of a real man like you. With a hard black beard, without so many muscles ... Who can't swim ... And he even drowns ... Wait , "I can't swim" ... It's not my fault, but that offender's ... ... who did not lift a finger to help me. But if he saved you. Who? Yes. You sank and he threw himself ... ... if not, how would you have come ashore? So thank you very much. To kill you have to be a man. A man can kill a man. Not that one there. Why have you killed? Yes, once, in Africa. Give it to me now, Flavio! How do you open it ...! Damn!

Silence! "Kissed with AP" A.P., A.P., A.P... Alvaro Penezzato? Good, Alvaro! Even him! ¡Ah! "Hecho X con M... " ¡¿Has hecho X con M?! Gives you no shame? Don't you know it's not right I hate you cowards. Go on, Flavio! What do you do? Come on, Piero, we had fun. We are playing. Bah. Enough, let's play something else. What does it mean? Let's play tower! I shot everyone except Marina. Get out, get out! Me here, him there. In the middle of the dunes. Silence. I see him right away, he 's an English marksman. I pull out my gun and shoot. I give it. Falls off. Do we make Mr. Universe? Sorry, do you hope to win? I'm sure. If I don't participate, it 's out of honesty, sonny. Piero, give me a hand, let's put the sofa up front. Look, come see. What happens? You have to participate too. Come on, come on ... Please. The jury is female and I will vote for you. Nerd! Guys, leave me. I said no, I am not undressing, sorry. I have said no! Oh, it's fine. Veniero has improved, huh. ¡Piero! I would almost do X with Piero. He has low pecs. Bravo. Will he win ... Hey, why don't you try the bomb? That this is not rubber, it is all gym. Why don't you add some oil and pepper? Engineer, bravo! What do you think of the engineer? He has a good belly. And round ... Maciste's uncle! It looks like Mussolini. What Mussolini? The pianist's father? We want to see the final parade ... I can talk? Don't talk, kiss me. The word for china. Sure. For me, the best is Piero. It is true. Let whoever is in favor raise their hand. Piero. Yes Yes... All right, I give you my vote. Marina, write this down to my account. Why are you kissing him? Does the second have nothing? And the engineer? What does? It goes? He got angry? Why? How nice! It no longer rains. How come you are all wet? Leave it alone. Oh poor thing ... Francesca, you're a ... Come on, go. What's the matter, Tonino? Nothing! What's up, are you jealous? No. Is it because I kissed Piero? No. So we are at peace. Enough! Now I tell him I'm going ... ... I'm leaving because I can't stand it ... ... which is no longer possible, because ... Why don't we get married? Francesca, I love you. You know, Francesca, Franceschina, how good we would be together. I would do anything you want. Would you take me on a trip? Sure, all over the world. Acapulco, Calcutta, wherever you want. Ronca too? Snore? What is that? It is a small town near Perugia. There is my aunt that I have not seen for years ... ... and he promised me an aquamarine. And I want to go to Monte Carlo ... ... the game drives me crazy, the ball that spins! But I'm telling you, I like to lose. But at home we will be a little, right? Do we also have a house? Clear. A little house for you and me. With a good living room and a burning fireplace. You have a good black dress ... No, not black, better white. All right, whatever you want, white. I sit down, I hold your hand and we are like this in front of the fireplace. Oh! One moment, dear. It was the chickadee. Well, the fireplace maybe not. Better an electric stove. Hey, Dude! Come here, come! Come on, handsome. Come on, let's go. Do you need currency? Forever. What about 5 thousand? I would say good. Do you have objections of a moral or artistic nature, if I transfer my affections to the daughter of the East? ¿Veniero? It is quite clear that you neither have nor will you ever have 5,000 lire. It's okay. Di ... Away from the sun. Do you know where the engineer is? It is gone. Gone? How? If the car is still there. Gone with the whiskey. He's drunk, he's sleeping. Of course Piero kisses like a god. If Francesca hears you, she gouges out your eyes. French has her Milanese. Hey, has Piero ever kissed you? Yes, once we came back from the Olympics. A kiss that ... I blew out a filling. What harm ... If I think that in October I have to study Latin ... Who do you tell. Yo, private law, you see. Let's hope war breaks out. Let's hope. But they always agree. Buckle up, buckle up ... What, were you sleeping? No, what to sleep ... I was thinking ... thinking of you. I was also thinking of you. Yes? In all the nice things you said to me a while ago. Deep down, that's how I die of boredom. Think I have a friend who got married at 17. And in Africa they get married at 14. Maybe, deep down ... Come on, make me a nice statement. Why? Because they have never done it to me. They always propose to me. But as a joke. But never statements. Go ahead. Bah, it seems a little ridiculous to me. Yes ... Okay, I will try it. So, I could tell you that for a few hours I have completely changed; ... since I've been here with you and those crazy people ... ... laminated plastics interest me much less ... ... what's more, they no longer interest me. I'm interested in you, Francesca. Because you see, for me you have become a disease, an obsession ... I have a crazy desire for you, Francesca. And I have also understood ... ... that love can come like this, suddenly, like a blow. And that the paths of the heart are infinite ... ... and that's why I ask you to be by my side, Francesca. I need you. Did you hear the engineer? Have you seen that it has been declared? I have always said that more than an engineer you are a poet. What was that about the heart? "The ways of the heart are endless ..." I write it down. Sweetheart, how do you spell it, with the "s"? Engineer! Who has seen my lighter? Come on, don't be so mad! Engineer, greetings from everyone. Don't be angry ... Let's go. Sorry, sorry, mercy! That I run you over I will not stop. Okay, don't stop. I accelerate. Accelerate! Come on, Tonino, be nice, sorry. Per... ... to ... on ... "Forgives". Let's go! That, now go straight. Go straight. Now for. Why? Because the police are coming. Long! How strong! Shoes off! And now, a magnificent strip tease. That makes! Try this on ... No. I put it on the floor. Try the t-shirt. No no no. Slowly, like this. Pretty, very good! The skirt, the skirt. Nerd! That's good! Pretty, huh? Come on, keep going! Dammit! Behold. Go Go! Do you see Veniero? It does well, it does very well. The dancers of night clubs get excited with the dance. If you get close, they fall into your arms. Outside! There it goes! Look, isn't it wonderful? How? It's fantastic, isn't it? Park there, there. I hear nothing! Okay, it doesn't matter. Oh, there is a free kart! This is mine, I have reserved it. Ahead. What's it for? Look ... Oh, you have no change. Berlingheri! Here! Bisigato, from Ilva! Ah, Bisigato. How is it going? You know not ... I don't know, there's something, the features ... Have you had plastic surgery? Me? Oh no, it's the mustache. ¡Hostia, Berlingheri! Have you seen Eridania? Have you seen Eridania? It has gone up 8 points. Has bought? If I dont know. I believe. Let's go have a drink at the bar. No, you go. I stay here. Slow slow. Put on the gloves. Those hands! Pretty girl, huh. With her hair, her makeup, everything in order. That one in two years is ready. I put gasoline, huh. Are you crazy? And who pays? Some will pay. Tonino, do you pay? Yes, yes, I pay! Ah, do you know her? Damn, Berlingheri, you don't miss one. Always ready, always in the gap! How much is it? 5 thousand. Listen, you who are with the laminates ... Give me some advice, as a friend. In my Sacile factory I have installed MartinSiemens ovens ... ... they are the best in the world, they have cost me an arm and a leg ... ... but I'm not calm. Why... ... what the MEC has done, for example ... ... it has been a scam for us entrepreneurs ... ... because the one who pays is the usual employer, right? Because while I use Belgian coal , which costs me as much as before ... ... not a penny more, not one less ... These with my money do the politics of the Russians, of Khrushchev ... Overall, I pay taxes to enrich the Russians. So now I get involved with laminates too ... Excuse me, are you happy with the laminates? Friend. Excuse me, are you happy with the laminates? Who cares about laminates ?! Come on, Gino! Ah well. Have. Oh, I shit on ... What do you do? Don't be absurd, I introduce you to this friend of mine. What's your name, sorry? It has taught me to draw the curves ... ... it's extraordinary ... Excuse me, it was without malice ... ... if your daughter had told me that you were ... What daughter? Why isn't she his daughter? No way! So why are you slapping? Taking! No, it's not Berlingheri ... What a mustache or what a mustache! That is not him... What did I tell you? They are there! ¡Tonino! Quiet! I forbid you to harm him, he is my engineer! Leave it alone! Kill the engineer! Woman, come on! Let them stick! What are you doing, are you crazy? Are you nuts? Abusing the weak? Why don't you try us? Oh what a shiny helmet. Leave it, you like it. Because there are four of you, uh ... Try one at a time. Why waste time. Being four we finished before. And we sure do you harm. Has much damage been done, engineer? Tonino, poor Tonino ... Two strands of straw. You will have two children. Come on, engineer. As soon as we leave it alone the bundle. Come on, we take it. Tonight he runs out of fruit. Is not the. What a mustache or mustache ... That is not Berlingheri. Who will be ... Let engineer, I drive. You are in no condition. No ... Yes, yes. Close! Be careful! Look what you have done. Engineer, control that car better . Until enrollment ... My whole rear part has been ruined . Up to the bumper! Poor Tonino, you are made a Christ, I do not see you at all well. Let me heal you ... Let it ... Come on! Hi brother! Shift the gear! Put on the funeral march! Is there room for Piero? Do you at least want to leave the dead alone? A little respect, pardiez ... How conventional you are! The homeland, the family, the dead, the honor ... So we spend our whole lives respecting. You're Christian? Yes because? Then you know, when one dies, the body can be thrown away, the soul is already gone. Except mine, I have no soul. But to compensate, you have a great body ... Give me a Marlboro. You cannot reason with you. He is afraid? Whose? Of the dead. That is why he respects them. Kids, I'm not afraid of anything or anyone, is that clear? That I have to do? Get in and out, and now? No, it must surround the entire cemetery. After which, we will render you the funeral honors. "Funeral of an Engineer". Bobo, where are you? I go! And with the coffin: a ruler and a compass, nothing more. Go to hell. I walk you to the door. We can all go to the door ... ... but not a meter more, huh. Let's go. I will die before you. Come on, what do you know? I know. I'm sorry and you won't come to see me. Yes I will come. Ah, will you come? Then you see that I will die before you. That you don't die! Ahead. Please... Courage, engineer! Don't hesitate, go ahead! Tonino, eat here. The English soldier! Shooter! Hello. Come here. No, go, go! I didn't want to shoot you, I wanted to shoot the pigeon ... The pigeon! The pigeon! But you kill me! No! Go, go ... no! "The engineer who did it on him." Tonino, have you been afraid? Enough! You have inflated my balls. Tonino ... You have blown them all up for me! Tonino, wait for me! Go away! Scoundrels, criminals ... And this is the new generation? The future ruling class? The country is going to hell! I have 3,000 workers, I can handle these idiots. "The engineer who did it on him" ... Don't you understand that if I want to, I will split everyone's face? I am of Romano blood, understand? I split the faces of all of you, understand? Very true, engineer, a little fire? Thanks ... What are you doing here? I was falling asleep. Get down immediately! Yes, engineer, you need to use force. So according to you I should get my hands dirty, fight me? It is enough that it is with only one. With Piero, huh? He got it. Agree. Do you hear It's a speech from '37. Before the Austrian putsch. Extraordinary. What does it say? I dont know. What I like is the intonation. Ah, he's back. Hip hip ... hooray! But who is it, Tiberi? ¡Tonino! There they go! It knocks it down, knocks it down ... there Goodbye curtains. The engineer has broken them. So it kills him ... He was better than us. Hiding, huh. It has been covered. ¡Piero, enough! Pay attention, Piero! It has been hurt, you see? Bravo, engineer. Long live the winning engineer! You beat the boss! Bravo, engineer! Bravo! Engineer? Bathroom. ¡No! Is he our new boss? Exact. Tinì, what are you doing? Let's take a bath. No, what a bathroom! Yes, the bath at night! Come, let's take a bath ... Come on ... The naked bathroom. Athletes. But the moon is low. The bathroom goes with the moon high. And I'm also cold. So let's go karts. But it's closed! Well, let us open it, come. Yes, open it to us ... No. We'd better ride a horse. I don't know where the horse is. It will be sleeping. Well, we woke him up. Yes... I want to wake everyone up. Tonino, what are you doing? Tonino ... Poor engineer ... are you tired, huh? But what am I going to be tired ... Come on, go rest. I don't want to rest ... ... I want to bathe ... No. Nice sand. Quartz sand , iron ... molten sand. I want to give you a foundry. The "Francesca Foundry". I am "cosinado" Look! What happens? Silence! The boss is dead! Long live the boss! How beautiful, Tonino ... It's all so ... So ... deadly. Where is my AirFrance bag? This you take. Who has seen my lighter? Come on, find me an AlkaSeltzer or I'll drop dead. Yes, I make it. Who has tobacco? Or marijuana ... Oh God! I need hot milk and a hot water bottle ... Guys, make coffee. In Brazil, coffee is thrown into the sea. I'd give everything for a coffee. Everything? The what, for example? I don't even have the strength to respond. My head explodes.
