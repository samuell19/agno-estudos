Did you ever see a more beautiful place, ladies and gentlemen? Think you're the first tourist on the island. At the end, I'm sure you'll thank me for it. Oh, Cora, why didn't you let this killer sit on the seat beside the driver? You know it's much better than taking photos. You know very well that traveling in back makes me sick. I'm sorry, I forgot. Ah, I take an Earth in Paris. I wouldn't mind shutting myself off in the world in a place like this. Yes, I had a lot of trouble persuading the bad in to take paying guests, but he needs the money for his research. Look, there's a pain with you, the vogaria. I was under the impression. They only grew in the swamps. And that's a darling told near California. I've never seen one in Europe. This island is a horticultural wider land. I can't wait to talk to the parrot. You can't look at your husband. My husband. The island seems to be deserted. Doesn't anyone other than the baron live here? What? No, no one has since... Since what? Did something happen around here? Or does the baron just like solitude? Yes, that is, I mean-- You mean that there were some people on the island? Now they've all gone away? Well, no, Signore. No, not exactly. What happened to them? Why did there was a ridiculous vampire again? Oh, drive a slow down. Please, so now you expect me to take good pictures when you drive it at this rate of speed. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Go out! Go out! Go on a home and we'll get there and face him. Arms off. My god, he's not dead. Yeah, I'm afraid he is. I can't feel any pulse. But Signore, believe me, he was all of a sudden right in front of me. I could not stop in time. Don't blame your soft driver. What do you mean? I hit him. I know I did it. I could feel it. I saw what happened. He ran straight into the car like a blind man. Look at his face. I don't think he was killed by the car. I'd say he was scared to death. Look, we can't leave him here in the middle of the road. Help me to move him. Don't bother yourself, Signore. He was my cook. My servant will take care of it. And look out for you, I don't want you to feel responsible for the accident. He was suffering from an incurable illness. A while ago, he ran from the villa, hysterical, screaming. The accident put a merciful end to his suffering. Poor fellow. Please don't upset yourselves over this. It's been coming for a long time now. In spite of this dreadful accident, I welcome you to my villa. Please. You are entering the botanical gardens now. You will see my lovely orchids. Some specimens are from Africa and South America. Others I developed here. Beautiful, Baron. Yet you say they are not hybrids. No, Mr.-- Junior's Demerus, Darren, University of Michigan Bothemist. Well, Mr. Demerus, it's always nice to have a colleague with me here. Welcome aboard. I like it here. Extraordinary, that's a specimen of flour should grow-- No, Mr. Demerus, I don't think so. All the plants here are indigenous to the-- Why wasn't referring to the geographical attitudinal aspects? No, quite possibly you'd recall a series of experiments that a colleague of mine, Professor Richard, to the University of Utah, performed last year in the Hawaiian Islands. The University and the Government were generous. He did an exhaustive study and specifically concentrated on soil structure. But the soil here is rich in minerals. They promote rapid growth. Rich in minerals, but not in nitrogen. What do you mean? I saw some cobra plants and the butterworts on the way up here and insectivorous plants are forish in soils poured in nitrogen, which they must obtain from their-- victims, isn't that so, bad? Yes. Yes, quite true. This way, please. They're lovely. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the villa. Let me welcome you to it. Oh. Now, if you'll be so kind, please follow me. Right through you, ladies and gentlemen. I must ask you to refrain from handling the object of art to guard in this house. Here you'll find artworks dating back to the fourth and fifth century. There'll be time to see you all tomorrow. You'd probably like to freshen up before dinner. You'll find rooms marked with your names. The entire villa, all of the gardens and some ancient ruins that ought to be found on the ground-- --are all of your dispersal. I hope you'll make my home pure. Now, Mrs. Callahan-- Mrs. Callahan, please, no photographs inside. Outside, it's all right. But inside, don't do it. This is not a museum. Thank you. Hi. It's so beautiful here, don't you think? I bet it's the villa you'll find so interesting. Oh, sure. It's not the driver. You're also excited about it. What do you mean? I mean that I'm sick of seeing my wife behaving like a-- Like a what? Come on. Say it. Well, are you afraid? Like a-- like a prostitute. What makes you think you're so wonderful? Just because I married you doesn't mean you own me. But Cora, I always-- Listen, my friend. I can still do what I want. Cora, I'm warning you. [LAUGHING] Just be careful. You're rarely regretted. [KNOCKING] Well, hello. Your bags. Oh, very sweet. My husband will reward you later. It will not be necessary. Don't worry. Good evening, Adam. Good evening to you, sir. Good evening. Oh! Good evening, Professor. Wherever you want. Thank you, sir. I took the liberty of lighting a fire because even though the days can be warm and semi-tropical, the nights are in time to get quite from pictures to very cold. I trust you will all find the food satisfactory into your liking even though you may find it unusual. Please sit there. Can you see me? No. I'm afraid so. I'm quite an orthodox, Mrs. Callum. But don't be alone. I want you to know that everything you're about to eat was grown in my garden. Oh, really? I'm a vegetarian. I'm a vegetarian, Mrs. Callahan. But simply your cucumber. What do you think? Really? Is it good? Very good. Very good. Very good indeed. Hey. It looks like a cucumber. But it tastes just like meat. It's quite the greasy, extraordinary. I hope you'll find the other vegetables also to your liking. Why Baron, how did you ever do it? A mutation, Mrs. Robinson. Seeking an improved flavor, I experimented with the process of irradiating the germ plasm without a violet light. This developed varied mutations, and one of the mutations turned out to have a flavor quite similar to beef. Unfortunately, the new species bred true. I see. Fascinating. Simply fascinating. Oh, thank you. All those amazing. The caution is run up and down my spine. Why, Baron, if you could make a fortune with this stuff, if you put it on the market, just think there. Why you and I could grow our own stakes. Shut up, Jim, will you? How old is Dave Villa, Baron? Vanilla. Oh, it's quite old. Quiet, Villa, Mr. Moss. 5 December. Oh, you're an idiot, all in a hand. I've been fainted by a body of talking. Please, gentlemen, please. Please. This is not the man you saw this afternoon. Perhaps I should have told you. My fault, I'm sorry. This is his twin brother. He seems awfully calm for a man whose brother was killed just a few hours ago. The twins have been with me for years. Mr. Moss and Baldi was fully aware of his brother's condition. I'm afraid his brother's death was more of a shock to all of you than it was to Baldi. He knew that death could come at any time and was prepared by it. Please sit down. Please. You cannot have some more wine, Baron. A certain labises, Robert. I assure you, my friend said Baldi is perfectly harmless. He has no trace of his brother's illness. No, no. That's nothing to be afraid of. You should get to know Baldi better. He knows every inch of the island and could make you stay much more enjoyable. I hope you like the wine that's made here. Exactly what was wrong with Baldi's brother. I never saw such terrible marks. It was a rare tropical disease that had the doctors baffled to. Excuse me a minute, then. I'm sure they-- What's wrong with him? Let me tell you something, Baldi may seem harmless to you, but to me, it seems like he's out of somebody's life. [LAUGHTER] Well, to be candid, as much as I love my work, I have no illusions about it. The world of nature is more than just beauty and sweet smelling flowers. Nature can be ruthless and deadly. Are you referring to Darwin's theory, Baron, the so-called survival of the fittest? In part, Mr. Gemriss. It's true that the jungle like our human society is a battleground. But what interests me more than the survival of the species is what I call a kind of interplay of nature. What sort of interplay, Baron? All kinds, Mr. Moss. I'll try to explain my ideas and laymen's terms. Do you realize that we, all of us, as well as all other living creatures are totally dependent for our existence on the lowly earthworms? True. Oh, slimy thing. You can't be serious, Baron. Well, it's a fact, Mrs. Robinson. Without the earthworm, plants would not be able to grow in the soil. Without plants, there would be no food for animals or man. The human race could not have evolved about the earthworms. There really is nothing more important. I always thought that earthworms were just good for fishing. You should know about worms. Speaking of fishing, if anybody's interested, the sea around will eyes full of fish and worms are available. And that's likely a finished dinner, Baron. Do you suppose? Yes, of course. Ladies and gentlemen, if you will allow me, I'd like to show you some of my specimen. Since I'm no lady, you go ahead with your little tour. Don't worry. I'll stay here and get drunk or by myself. Don't you think you've had enough? How much is enough, Jim? Do you know enough of what? You and all your book talk about nature. What do you stuff shirts know about nature? That's my game. I'll tell you about nature. I've seen enough, Cori. You're drunk. You better? Don't go away from me, you rule. Mrs. Robinson, I think you're not quite yourself. I suggest you come to the kitchen with me. Bali will give you some coffee. Will you excuse us for a moment? My wife's wife. She doesn't hold her liquor very well. Look at that plant. That's odd. I've never saw them touch that plant. I'm sorry, but one inch more, Mr. Robinson, that you'd regret it. Why is that? Is it poisonous? Well, not exactly. It's not poisonous. It's a porcupine plant, my friend. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But one inch more, Mr. Robinson, that you'd regret it. Why is that? Is it poisonous? Well, not exactly. It's not poisonous. It's a porcupine plant, my friend. It's not poisonous. It's a porcupine plant, my friend. But unlike the animal of the same name, it has the ability to throw its quills, whatever it senses the enemy approaching. What happens if one of the quills should hit you there? A temporary paralysis. For two hours, you'd be unable to move a muscle, somewhat similar to a general anesthetic. Oh, well, then I'm glad you stopped me when you did. About my wife. Then she's all right. She's having coffee. She'll join you when she feels better. Oh, thanks, madam. I'll just go and see how she's doing. Do that. Well, I promise to show you some specimens. So far, I've shown you a carnivorous plant that exists in nature. None of these are my creations. They are simply transplantations. Now, I'd like to show you something different. Oh, amazing. Is this a new species, Baron? That's correct, Mr. Demerus. I call it agave muscipula, a product of my own laboratory. Agave, century plant, muscipula. Baron, you've crossed the century plant with a venous play trap. Very good, Mr. Demerus. You're perfectly correct. But how did you do it? I bombarded the germ plasma of the seed with x-rays a number of times. This process increased the natural rate of mutation 1,000 pho. Finally, after hundreds of unsuccessful mutations, I was fortunate enough to be able to produce the plant you see here. You know, that's all great to me. Is this one a killer? Carnivores, who heard Mr. Moss? Not killer. Oh, it smells like fresh meat. Exactly. What's more, it hasn't over that's particularly attractive to small animals. A astounding, incredible, accomplished, McBarry. You're very kind, Mr. Demerus. Too kind. And now I'd like to show you agave muscipula and action. Baldi, would you bring me a mouse, please? I don't think I'm going to like this. All in the interest of science, Miss Christensen. Nowhere in the world could you witness such a demonstration. Would you rather go to your room? No, I'll stick it out if the rest of you are going to. Say your prayers, mosey. Maybe the mouse will run away. Oh, hello. No, my little friend won't run away. He's hungry. He hasn't been fed in quite a while. Now watch. The smell would be irresistible. Hey, I fell in a cat. Oh, I've never seen anything like this. I'm glad you waited until after we ate. To show us your specimens, Barry. You're right about nature. It can be terrible. And man can make it even more so. Don't you agree with me, Barry? I'm terribly sorry if I've said any of you by my demonstration. I didn't mean to. Please forgive me. But let me show you, please. It's some very unusual thing. I'm... I'm... I'm fascinated. Good night, Barry. Good night. The technical details wouldn't interest the others, Barryn. But you must tell me about your creation. The agave must skip you. Why don't you join me in my study for a breath? Oh, yes indeed. Would you young people excuse us? We are going to have a kind of scientific gossip. Sure, Barryn. Thank you. Good night, Mr. Dambach. Not only will I tell you, I'll show you photographs of the hybrid and the earth's utensils. I have slides of the species in all these experiments and states. I hope if I consider this a very great honor indeed, Barryn. I do appreciate you taking me into your confidence like this. I can't say I'm very sleepy. You. No, I'm not. I'm afraid I'll have nightmares when I do fall asleep. That awful plant and the accident this morning. From that statue, it represents the Hindu God Siva. You know what it's called? No, what? The destroyer. Really, Mr. Moss? I don't see. It's just something I remember from school. We study statues as well as buildings. Please, do me two favors, will you? All right. If I can. One call me David. Agreed. If you'll call me Barryn. It's a pleasure, Barryn. Two step outside with me for a breath of fresh air. Oh, fine. I need some. You made a fool of yourself in Rome and now you're drunk again. Everybody has his own way of enjoying himself. The Barryn with his plants that he might. And you? Just like to be stupid. Cora, listen, let's cut out all this nonsense. Oh, don't start again. Otherwise out. Otherwise you'll what? Let's not argue anymore. I'm tired. I should never allow myself to be talking to these holidays. They always end in fiasco. Cora, for heaven's sake, leave the window open. You know I like fresh air in the room. But the wind's rising. Maybe there'll be a storm. Then leave it open a little. Otherwise we'll suffocate in heaven. No worry. I don't know. Maybe I'm crazy. I'll knock you back to have a wild imagination, I say. But what is it, David? Look, tell me one more favor, will you? That makes number three. When you go up to your room, lock your door, windows too. Whatever's going on. Even if it's only my imagination. Beth, it won't hurt you to play things safe. All right. It's getting late. I think I'll go up to my room now. Aren't you coming in? I think I'll stay out here for another smoke. Remember what I said. Okay? Yes, I will. Good night, David. Good night. No, never lonely. I have the means and freedom to do my work. Never lonely. Don't touch that. Mrs. Robinson. I'm sorry, Mrs. Robinson. If you misunderstood me. Yes, I guess I must have. I'm sorry, but you were about to touch my giant gardenias. It took me years to develop these. Many years. They're extremely delicate. Why, a touch with your finger would have killed one of them. Giant gardenias. Very delicate giant gardenias. Yes, Mrs. Robinson. I think I'll go to bed. That's a good idea. There's a tour of the garden early in the morning. Thanks for the cigarettes. Well, be shy, are you? You boys, we didn't find you. My friends, you understand. Don't you? Mrs. Hallahan, that's good evening. I was just checking to see if you were alright. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Yes, I don't like it now, you see that? It's a beautiful day. Oh, yes, it's beautiful. We have many such days, Mr. Demerus. Look there. It didn't take long for Mr. Robinson to use the worms we were talking about yesterday. Good morning, Mr. Robinson. We thought you were still asleep. Oh, it's a delightful morning. Yes, we were just saying the same thing. I went out to finish. I thought myself quite a few, as you can see, you should be tasted little thing. Isn't Cora with you? She should be done by now. No, I haven't seen her. I couldn't sleep in Sonya, I guess, so I took advantage of your old heist. Excuse me if it wasn't the right thing to do. My apologies, but I used your pole and other equipment. Well, don't worry about it. Why don't you go and bring your wife down to breakfast? Take the fish to the kitchen, but they will prepare it for you. Oh, thank you. Mrs. Callan, we're going into breakfast. I'll be back in a little while. A moment will do it. My bag isn't that antique, I need it today. Get up, Cora. We're going to have breakfast in a minute. Quit playing games. I know you're awake. You never sleep this late, Cora. Oh, my God. Come on. Oh, my heavens. Oh, God. Cora. Cora. Cora. Cora. Cora. Molly. Brandi, please. Faith is bloodless. Faith is white. They don't do. Faith, I'll never begin. Brandi, let's run some drinking. It's good for you. Oh, oh, no, my God. My wife, Cora, she's dead now. So many children. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, I'll tell you who's dead. I will rush. Me? Yes, you. Yeah, you. You did it. No. You are the killer. You're a maniac. You were sneaking around the house last night. Yes, it was my room and he had no business then. Yes, Baron. I'm sure he was. No credit to the bottom, Baron. He's guilty. The serious accusation, Mrs. Callan. It's time for accusations. Wouldn't you say, Baron? Two people died here last night. Who's arms did they die in? Mr. Moss, I don't know what you mean. Oh. We could ask Baldy's brother. But he's dead. Two. Isn't he? An accident, Mr. Moss. The cook was killed by the car that brought you. If that's true, what about Cora Robinson and the driver? Were their deaths also accidental? Mr. Moss, all of you. I want you to know I must tragically puzzled by these events as you are. No, there's no doubt about it. He's the killer that fink. You must not make hasty accusations, Mrs. Callan. A terrible crime has been committed. The police on the mainland must be notified. I'll do it at once. Yeah, you're gonna do it. Are you all right, Beth? Come on. You look like you could use some fresh air. I wish I would. Mayor, Mr. B, will you get you? The nobody hated her enough to do that. No. No, it's not like that. No, that's no thing to kill. No, I am the demerit. I said, "I hope not to pull." Cora, you're in a place like this. At least you can say that your hunch was right. Are you feeling a little better now? Yes. I'm all right. Hello, operate. Hello. Well, my friends, I have a great to inform you that the telephone line to the mainland seems to be out of order. I don't have to wait. No telephone. But the theory isn't you back to late tomorrow afternoon? We may all be. Daddy thinks I have a wife. Hello. Tell him. I'm not being taken in my own life. No, you may. You tell her, Baron, I'm no murderer. I wouldn't have to... Yeah, he's not cheering me. Well, I hope you're satisfied, Mr. Moss. The line was dead. You were right. My apologies for doubting your word. Thank you. Wait a minute. I couldn't be the murderer. None of us could have done it. Why do you say that, Mr. Demerit? That's all. Why all the doors were locked. Only one window was open just a few inches. Yet he wasn't killed by a bullet or any other missile. Don't you see? No man could have killed him. A vampire, Cora. Did you say a vampire? Yes. Why not? Demerist is right. The window in our room has a 50-foot sheer cliff outside with no way for anybody to climb. But a bat. Surely, Mr. Robinson, you don't believe that. There was no blood in the body, Baron. And the driver of the car told us yesterday that everybody left this island because of a vampire legend. He said no one wanted to stay here except you, Baron. And I thought I was living in the 20th century. Just a moment, Baron. I don't believe in vampires. But the people did leave the island, true? Yes, of course. Why? Why? Because they actually thought there was a vampire. And there was! There was not. Some animals were found with very little blood in their bodies. Could have been a disease similar to leukemia. I tried to explain this to the fools, but they prefer to believe the old vampire legend. So they frightened themselves away, you see. And that's what happened. How did the murderer get through those windows? That's what I want to know. But you can't deny it. They say their bodies were also drained of blood. A vampire! That's what you are! But you won't get this old lady. A vampire murder has been committed. Yeah, exactly. Why don't we be sitting around here like this? A vampire? I'm just so tired of you. A pirate! A pirate! A pirate! It's not up to us to solve the murders. The point is that the murderer, whoever or whatever he is, is still at large. The telephone's dead, so we can't call the police. The ferry won't be here until tomorrow. Now what we have to do is concentrate all our efforts on figuring out a way to get off this island. Baron? Yes, Mr. Moss. Do you have a boat? I do, Mr. Moss. We have a motor launch that we use for emergency trips to the mainland. It's at the dock. Well, what are we waiting for? It hasn't been used for some time. It may need fuel or water. All right, you and I can take care of that. And the others can be packing their things. Whatever you say, Mr. Moss. Be careful, David. Excuses with access in a little while. Tell me, do you have a car, Baron? No, there's always Alfredo's, of course. How do you usually get around the island? No, bicycles. There are several behind the villa, Mr. Moss. By the way, what's been done with the bodies? Uh, lacking a morgue, I had Baldi put them in the family vault. There's the boat, Mr. Moss. I'm afraid so. How do you explain that? Apparently, the killer didn't want us to leave the island, so he scuttled the boats. Yes, apparently. No pictures to be taken in the house. But when the cat's not home, the mouse will roam. What's the matter? Twice or said, "How are we all about to take a ride to the mainland and live happily ever after?" Yeah, sure we are. So never mind, kids, is a finder. I'm going to worry about it anymore. I'm going outside to take some more pictures. [tense music] Do you think it's wise to leave the villa, Mrs. Callahan? With characters like you inside, I can tell you it's much safer to be on the outside. Sorry. But you shouldn't be alone. Let me come with you. Okay, if you want us. So come on. Call us at David and the Baron, come back, and we're out, Sam. See you guys. Dear. One stop looking up, pointing it over, you know. Look for who? David? Why not? If not David. Oh, well. It's really a shame. You and that fine young fella too. I do wish you'd stop being so mysterious. I got some really great shots in the garden this morning! Oh, look! I'm marvelous! Come on! Alright, wait for me! I'm coming! Wait! Oh! Oh, beautiful! Why don't we go on? Alright, but... Not too far from now. No! Nature can't be beat. Really, it's beautiful here. Beth, you know it's sad that we'll never get to see these pictures. Will you tell me what you're talking about? Why, death? Death is what I meant. Death? What do you mean? Who's death? Mrs. Robinson? The drivers? Who's? My dear, there's no escaping it. You know, none of us is gonna leave this island. You'll die before we are rescued, and we'll all be killed except that Demar is carried dead. Be, I'm not important. Who's gonna cry over the lights of me? No one. I just wonder who the next victim will be. Stop it, Maria! Please, pity that such a nice young pair like you and David should have to die. And it's such a horrible way, too. Beth, where are you going? Beth, come back here! Beth, come back here! Beth? Put her down. I said put her down. You hear me? But we'll do you no good, Mr. Moss. Baldy takes orders only from me. I'd write you not to use force. He's abnormally strong. Tell him, then, Baron. Tell him, of course. Put a lady down, Baldy. Yeah. What happened? I would say Miss Christensen is not in any serious condition. Probably only faint. What have you done to her? Answer me! He cannot tell you, Mr. Moss. Although he hears and understands you, Baldy's a mute. I swear if he's heard or he'll pay. Beth? What happened? You're all right now, Beth. You were lost in the woods and faded. Baldy found you. Oh, yes. I remember running. Oh, no. It was a hole myself. I fell in the hole. I can't remember anything else, David. That's all right. Don't you worry about it now, Beth. Why don't you get out of here, you guys? This broke creature. Obviously, it's a bath, clean clothes and a good breath. Shouldn't we be leaving? In the boat here yet? In the day? We can't use the boat. Someone scuttled it. Oh, no. But don't worry. We'll manage fire. You won't be far away. Oh, please, please. All right. Just rest. Send Myrtle for me if you want me, Beth. Mr. Moss. Oh, Mr. Moss. Have you seen the bad? Yes. Is there something like you? An exquisite flower. Isn't it, Mr. Demenist? You surely can't be serious. But I am, Dad. I have proof. An exciting plant, huh? The fabric, the texture. A very interesting plant. You mean you believed that one of my experiments got out of control and is responsible for these things? I have seen it with my own eyes. I realize, of course, that you were unaware of the deadly potential of this. But you have so many experiments. One man couldn't possibly keep track of them all. Well, Mr. Demenist? We are both scientists, are we not? Scientists must have proof. Do you mind showing me your proof? Yes, of course, Baron. I'll show you the carcass. It's bloodless, like the others. This explains everything. I can see now why the vampire legends started when those other animals look out. I can take a leave of absence from my university. We can work on this together. An interesting proposition. Interesting. It's more than that, Baron. We'll make botanical history here. You really think so? I'm sure of it. We'll write books about your work yet, so the world will learn of your genius. Just a minute, Mr. Demenist. If there's one thing wrong with your theory, I don't want books written about my experiments. You don't? No, I don't want publicity. I don't want the world to know of my genius. And in addition, you are wrong, Mr. Demenist, about my experiments being out of control. I'm never out of control. Never. You killed those people? You? Thank you, mad lady. Sorry. It was necessary. I hated to do that, Demenist. I really liked you. Bali. Get rid of her. Use discretion. He was a nice man. Stop, Bali. Don't try to get away. You're...so it was you. And you got poor Demerus too. You better bring him inside. Mr. Moss, what's wrong? Ask Bali. Put him down, Bali. Mr. Demerus. He is the murderer, Baron. I caught him lugging his latest evict him away with him into the wards. He must have scuttled at launch and cut the telephone wires. Who else could have done it? He ever then seems quite complusant. Hard to believe. But why? Your brother. Why did you do it? We better lock him up until the police get here. I agree. I regret this, Bali, but you'll have to be taken into custody. Come on, Baron. He's getting away. Do you have any idea what we'll do when we overtake him, Mr. Moss? I'll think of an idea. I have. There he is. Run him down, Mr. Moss. We'll be on top of him in a minute. He's gone. Drive on, please, Mr. Moss. Wait, stop. I think he may have turned up this part. I know where it's gone. Where? Follow me. Why this cemetery? His brother's there. What, he's dead? Yes, but Baldy's mind is unbalanced. He will seek the only person who represents security to him, and that's his brother. Dead or not, it's this way. Come on. Here, this brother. You think he's in there? No. There's no rear door he wouldn't enter, Tramp. He'd hear somewhere. Well. There, Mr. Nuss. In there. Is there a back door? Yes. I'll go around. Watch out, he's a man here. Look out! Thank you, Mr. Nuss. Look out! Good God. I suppose it's only just. Let's go back to the dinner. Yes, Mr. Nuss. I'm so glad they don't get back soon. I'm glad. I'm not them. Somebody had to do it. Don't be afraid anymore, Beth. There's a great stone brewing, but it's still in a distance. I thought it'll start raining right away. You know, I think I've taken, I think, a thousand shots, and there's still one I can never get. I've tried over and over without any of itself. Look at it, then I'm going to do it. A picture by a flash of lightning. You're going outside? Why, your cause. Where is it done with it? Me, say. Now that Baldi and Demers did die, I feel free. What the storm? Oh, I'll take a picture of some pretty things around them, Bella, and I'll return soon enough. Don't worry about me, I'll be okay. This looks great. Please don't leave me. We must be going now. I wonder what happened to Myrtle. She should be back by now. You know what a nut she is about, cameras. Well, I hope she's all right. Don't worry, that old girl can take care of herself. Hi. Thank you. Hi, I've built a fire. Yes, it seemed like a good night for one. Where's Mrs. Scott? She went out. Oh, what for? She wanted to take some pictures. To take pictures? Tonight? Yeah, she's been out now about ten minutes. What a really droll idea. Well, she may have gone to a room, but we didn't hear of coming. I'll go up and check out that. It has been an exhausting day. Horrible day. There's something that I don't understand. What is that, Mr. Moss? Why did Baldi's brother mention arms just before he died? That statue there. My sealant could be that. But statues don't kill today, Mr. Moss. Obviously, you know all it goes on here, and yet you claim not to know what Baldi was doing. You know, I can't believe that. That's your privilege, Mr. Moss. It's just the wait. I'll fix this. This whole affair has cost too many depth to shrug off, Farron. I never found the country. No, no, no, David! Promise me, it's my baby, take me with you too much. Take my blood, throw my blood. I will keep you, I promise you, we'll be together. I love you, they are here.
