We want you to look right into this camera and talk to the people of Georgia. So can you tell our fellow Georgians why they should vote for you? My family has been in politics and the power structure in this town of Hopewell for generations, and we're not about to concede to... some man who was born in Atlanta. Knows nothing about our ways. How could he? He's not from around here. He only wants to take from us good, hardworking taxpayers and give to the lazy, good-for-nothing folks that he thinks are entitled. What do you say to all the people that say your views are racist and hearken back to a Jim Crow South? Why does everybody think that white men are racist? I'm not a racist. I just don't believe that this is fair. He got here because of affirmative action. And if I'm elected to Congress, it'll be at the top of my agenda to do away with it. Another form of welfare is all it is, if you ask me. I had just about enough of you, Mr. White Man. I'm sorry, sir, but she won't go away. What does she want? She won't say. She's just been sitting there for hours. Well, I'm busy. Yessir. I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't just walk... No, it's all right, Joan. Thank you. Something I can do for you, ma'am? I'm fairly busy. I want you to look into a murder that happened here in Hopewell. - Have you spoken to the Sheriff's Office? - Ain't for them. They killed him right here in this town in 1947. You want me to look into a murder that happened over 40 years ago? I'm sorry. Mrs... Hattie Mae's my name. I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to help you. Why don't you speak to the Sheriff's Office? I never wrote nothing down on the paper. Life's too long. He wrote down everything. Everything you need to know. It's right here. "Leanne Harper"? "Dear Lil Ann." "My mama's cousin Winnie got sick, so she asked me to take her to Summerville yesterday, about four hours away from where we live now." "Hope you got my letter about moving to Hopewell County with a forwarding address." "You know, as we drove past my mama's old house, it's falling apart now, but it still bring back one good memory." "When we first met." "I can still smell the lavender and the moonshine." ♪ If you see my rooster ♪ ♪ Please, run him on back home ♪ ♪ I have found no eggs in my basket ♪ ♪ Eee-eee ♪ ♪ Since my rooster been gone ♪ ♪ I heard my rooster crowing ♪ ♪ This morning Just about the break of day ♪ Who that there?

Get it from my mama. And as I said, you should have sang that song. My... my pa don't like my singing. He want me to play. Well, maybe playing is not for you. Horace John Boyd's my name, but everybody call me Bayou. Why they call you that? My pa says my eye's deep as the bayou from the time I was born. Let me see your eyes. Your eyes are normal. Your daddy don't seem like he know much. You mind your manners. That's my pa. I'm sorry, Horace John. Bayou is what I like to be called, Bucket. My name is Leanne Jean Harper, and I prefer to be called by my name. Don't you ever call me Bucket, or I'll never speak to you again. I best be going. Hey. I... I'm... I'm sorry. I ain't mean no harm. Whoa. Whoa. Damn. I hope my book knocked some sense into your head. - Will I see you again, Lil Ann? - When you learn how to say my name. When you feel that baby coming, you come see me. Don't you wait. Yes, ma'am. I won't. I'll be right here. Take care, y'all. Oh! Well, don't you look nice! I take it you really like her. You took...

Where you going, boy? Leave him be now. Go on, Bayou. Where he going? He gonna ask that gal if he can take her to the social. What gal? Bucket? She ain't gonna go nowhere with him. - Hey, Bayou! - Leave him be now! Hold on. Hold on now! You gonna ask Bucket to the social? - Her name ain't Bucket. Leave me alone. - What? Oh, look at you. Oh, you a big boy now, huh? She ain't gonna go with you. Look at your clothes. I said, leave me be now. All right. Want me to leave you alone? What the hell are you talking about? - Get off! - Why'd anybody like you? - Willie Earl! - Ain't nobody gonna like you. - Okay? Why would anybody like you? - Willie Earl! - I told you to leave him alone! - What? The boy gotta learn how to get tough at some point, Hattie. Buster, go on in the house and leave him be, I said. You too, Willie Earl. Come on, Willie. I'm gonna teach you a new song. We'll leave her here with this sorry boy. Go on. Come on. Why him and Daddy treat me like that? You don't worry about them. Or nobody else. You hear me? You go on over there, and you ask her. Mm-hmm. Go on now. Hold on. Let me get this dirt off your back. She ain't gonna like you! What you want, boy? Hello, sir. Speak up. Um... I want... I wanted to... My mama's a wash woman, sir, and I wanted to know if you had any washing need to be done. You think I'm stupid, boy? No. You after Bucket, ain't ya? No, sir. Now, you get on away from around here. You gets off my land before I kills you! Get on around from here! You've been quiet. She said yeah? No. Why you gotta be so mean to this boy? It ain't right. I don't care. - It ain't right. - It's all right, Mama. I can handle myself. You hear that, Willie Earl? Now, Bayou, that's something I'd like to see. Buster, now you stop it. I get to say what I want at my own damn supper table! Come on, Willie Earl. Willie gonna finish his supper. Come on. Eat your supper. Did you read the letter? What? I... You don't know how to read. It say, "Meet me at the yew tree." Come on. You... you shouldn't be out here. Your grandpa gonna be mad. He passes out drunk every night about this time. But if you want, I can go. I... I don't want you to do that. Why you come, then? I came to ask you to the social. That's nice, but... he won't let me do that. He won't let me be around nobody. Why come? He just mean. It's like he hates me. Yeah. I know the feeling. I don't even know why I came to see you. I know it ain't proper. I hope you don't think bad of me. No... no, I'm glad you did. - Promise me you won't tell nobody. - No, I won't. He would kill me if he knew. I won't. I won't. How old are you? Seventeen. I'm 16. Why you don't know how to read? Well, my pa and my brother say I'm too slow to learn. Don't you listen to that. You can. You looked so beautiful in that night light. I'll show you. Ain't never known nobody to encourage me but my mama. And she ain't make me feel like you did. Thank you. That first night we stood there at that tree for hours, just talking, almost till the sun come up. I sure appreciate it. And every night after that, I couldn't wait for that airplane to come through my window. It was so innocent, so pure. It were... We did something we both needed real bad. We laughed. We laughed a lot. Sound it out! And you bought a book, and you taught me to read. - "It was a long hot summer." - That's right! That's right! Mama wondered what was wrong with me. But she was so happy that I was reading, she ain't ask much. Couldn't tell her. She'd be mad that I was sneaking out the house at night and because you asked me not to tell nobody. But I sure wanted the world to know. But I didn't understand the shaking. Always felt like there was so much you wanted to say, but for some reason... you never did. You'd just shake like a leaf in the wind. All right. If you look here... Sometimes I thought, even on a hot night, you would just shake. You all right? Like your soul was trying to shake something out. All summer long we met in that tree. I was worried about what would happen when the season rains come. But you know what? There you were. I thought you was crazy, gal. Truth is... we was both starting be crazy about each other. Like we know what was being said, and we wasn't even talking. Can you stay a little longer? Um... My mama will be getting up soon. Okay. And that was our first kiss. Ain't nothing felt that good in all my life. I walked home floating, like my feet didn't even touch the ground. But that ain't last long. Come on! - Just come here. - Get away from me! I said come here. You put your hands on me again, I swear, I'll kill you dead. Where you been, boy? Come here. You touch him, I'll meet your soul at the gates of hell. You ain't shit. Just like your black ass daddy. Buster... Willie Earl, that's my boy. He make me proud. Get on out of here, now. I'm gonna go on up to Chicago. Hmm? And... and I'mma play at the Capitol Royale. You all gonna see. This is my money, Buster. - You ain't taking it. You ain't, Buster. - My money too. No! How else am I supposed to get there? Buster, that's all we got. Hey, Daddy, Daddy. Dad, I wanna go with you. No, son. The road ain't... It ain't the place for you. - You's too young. - No, Daddy, please! Willie Earl, come here. - It's your fault. It's your fault too! - Willie Earl, stop it. He told me! I will slap the taste out your mouth. Where you been? My daddy walked out on us. I'm sorry, Bayou. That's all right. It's for the best, I guess. I'm gonna have to help my mama with more of her washing. And she'll be up late doing it. You can't come here no more. No, I... I can. I can. I'mma just be late. That's all. You look sad. Don't be. I need you to be happy because we can't be sad together. You hear me? Yeah. Every gal in town looked at me and laughed 'cause of what my brother had said to them about me. Not you. You made me feel like a man. You made me feel good. You made me... I'm in love with you. I best be going. But... - Lil Ann... - No, no, I... I gotta go. I hated that night. I was so confused. Maybe I shouldn't have told you I loved you. W... Boy! Boy, you done lost your mind. Mama, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. You don't need me here. Here, that's my dream. But you got this nothing. - He can help you. - Don't you call him that! I'm 19 now, Mama. You can't stop me. I'mma going to Chicago. I'mma find Daddy. I'mma play in the band with him. Willie Earl! He don't know nothing about Chicago! Let him go, Mama. My mama cried all night. Come on, come on in the house. I'd have given anything to not see her sad. Every night, I waited for her to cry herself to sleep. And I lay there waiting for a paper airplane... ...or waiting at that tree for you. We went from talking every night, all summer long, to you not coming at all. I got so worried. So I went to your house that night. No. No! I never told you, but I saw it. I hated every day I didn't come in there and kill him. What kind of... What kind of man I'm is that I didn't. Maybe my brother and daddy're right. Maybe I am weak. Such a beautiful letter. I'm so glad to see you. You all right? Maybe I shouldn't have told you that I love you, but I do. That's how I feel. - But if you stop coming to see me... - No, it ain't that. I... I love you too. Then marry me. I'm... I'm not a pure girl. I don't care. I love you. I love you. We can run away. Anywhere. We'll be all right. Just marry me. - He won't let me. - Hey. - He won't let me. - Hey, hey. I'll deal with him. You just say, "Yeah." - Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? Yeah! Ain't nothing holding you here. You should move to Hopewell County. It's where all the business is for colored folk. You could open you up a proper juke joint. Citsy. What's keeping you here, huh? Buster gone, and Willie Earl gone. I'm moving over there too. My cousin said she might be able to give me a job. I'm going. I don't know. It ain't big like Atlanta. I know you don't like the big city. I'm telling you, you gonna like it. You should come too. Tell her, Bayou. Come on! - How far away that is from here? - About four hours by train. - Uh, Hopewell County, you say? - Yeah. Yeah, the Negroes are doing so good over there. - Come on. - Maybe we should leave, Mama. You want to leave here? Yeah, well, yeah. I wanted to tell you something. - Me and Leanne been courting for a while. - Bucket? No, don't... don't call her that. I knew something was going on. You sneak out of here at night. You know? Yeah. Just didn't know it was her. Yeah, well, I asked her to marry me, and her grandpa say no. But he a bad man, and I want to get her, take her with us. Baby, Bucket leaving. - Say what? - They leaving now. They tell me Ethel's here to take her up north with her. Bayou! - Now why you tell him that? - He done missed her. I'm sure they'd gone by now. Leanne, don't go. Don't go. Please. No. Don't, don't. My father told me what you did to her. You better thank heavens I'm not calling the sheriff. - Get out of here, and you leave her alone. - Don't... - Get in the car right now. - Leanne, don't. - Now! - Don't go. - I have to. - Don't go, Leanne. - I love you. - Get out! I love you. Leanne, I love you. Don't go. - I'm sorry. - Don't go, don't go. Don't you... I love you. - I'm sorry. - Please don't go. Come on, don't go! Come on, Leanne. Get out the car. Don't... Leanne, don't go! Don't... don't go! Don't go! Leanne, don't go. Don't... I told you to leave her alone, didn't I? "Dear Leanne." "Been writing to you every day for a year now." Left, right, left. Left... "Been sending letters to everybody in Boston with your last name, hoping that one of these letters finds you." "I wanted to tell you I got drafted to the army." "I'm here at Fort McPherson in Georgia." "Although they probably won't let colored soldiers fight here." "But if I do ship out, and I don't come back, I want you to know that I love you so much, and I miss you every day." "It'd mean the world to me to hear from you and to know you're safe." Mr. Waters. Yes, ma'am? Would you... ...be so kind as to return this to sender? I sure will. Also, return any more that come from that address. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you kindly. I hurt my leg from a blast in a practice drill. Nothing to worry about. I should be fine in a few months. Going home to my mama, and you know she can make anybody better with all the things she know and all the babies she done delivered, but because of it, I got discharged. Got to tell you, I was shocked when I got to Hopewell for the first time. Hopewell County! My mama and Citsy had moved over to Hopewell County, and they was doing pretty good. So good to see you. Easy. Watch my leg now. My mama never ceased to amaze me. She opened a real juke joint. When I tell you, seemed like all the colored folk in the county came near every weekend. I sure wish you could see how good she doing. She doing washing in the morning, that I help her with. She birth a baby here and there. And she sang the blues all night long. Oh, no, no, no.

Till one day, he showed up out of nowhere looking bad. He said he will return the favor if I help him get better. So I brung him down here to you. - What's wrong with him? - Hell if I know. Come on, Mama, everybody come to you when they sick or having a baby. I know you can help him. - I don't like it, I tell you. - Just help him! Where this one going, Mama? That big sack. Go down to the Clayton Place. Big white house off 22. You can't miss it. Citsy just started working there. - She'll be around back. - All right now. If that man die here, we gonna be in a world of trouble. You just make sure he don't. - Hey, Bayou. - Hey. Glad you're here. Set it down there. I made you some lemonade. Come on, sit a spell. I ain't knowed you to do this kind of work. Oh, well, the sheriff here's named Jackson. He asked me to look after his... baby brother 'cause he coming back home. So I said, "Okay," and here I am. - Mm. - And Jackson nice to me so... Citsy? Yes, sir, Sheriff Jackson. Get up from there. We don't allow colored to sit at the table. Oh, I'm sorry, Sheriff Jackson. He brung the wash, and I made him sit. Get up and get out of here. My brother's here. This is my brother John and his beautiful wife... Leanne. This is Citsy. I asked her to get this place ready for you. Well, Sheriff Jackson said you had a long drive. Can I get you something? This house is beautiful. It's been sitting empty since my father died. He left it to John here. - Left me most of the money though. - Well, it's lovely. Get on out of here, boy. Yessir. Sorry, sir. What is wrong with the Negroes down here? Oh, we keep them in line. Come on. I'll show you where you'll be staying since you're the sweetest mother-in-law on this side of heaven. You all right, darling? You're white as a ghost. Oh, she's fine. Maybe tired from the drive. Your brother drives like a madman. Can I get you something, ma'am? No. No, thank you. Shall we? Come on. We go this way past it. I need some milk and some more castor oil for him. Go in that box, get a pen and write this down for me. Who are all these letter for? Bayou writing to this girl. What girl? Bucket? Yeah. That fool's still writing her after all of these been returned to sender? Put flour on that paper. And sugar. - You get it all done before the rain come? - Yep. - "Dear Lil Ann. I love you so much." - Give me that. - "I miss you." - Give me that. - "Will you write me soon?" - Give me that, you son of a bitch! - That's mine! - "Please." Okay. - I'm joking around. - Give me all of 'em! Come on, Willie Earl. Take me to the store. I need to check my mail and get a few things. Why Bayou can't do it? He been helping me all day. Come on. And do you know what to do with that sick man in there? Bayou do. Now come on. We'll be back. I can't do this. What do you mean? We are in the South. Just a few hours from where we were both born. Someone will recognize us. - No, they won't. Look at us. - They will. They will. So what do you propose we do? - Go back to Boston? - Yeah. With nothing? That man left me with nothing. So you sure came and made me your cash cow, didn't you? Don't you dare talk to me that way. After all I've done for you. Now you get yourself together, girl. This family is well-off. I saw Bayou. That washerwoman's boy? Where? When we were driving. I think it was him. You're imagining things. Come on. Hey, whoa. Whoa. Hey now. Huh? Where am I? At Mama's house. Oh. Whoa, whoa. You... you should lay down. You ain't well. No, I... I am fine. I am fine. I am alive. Yeah. Here, here, drink this. It'll make you feel better. All right now. Where... where is your brother? He went to town with Mama. You should... you should eat something. I'll be right back. Leanne, that is a lovely dress. Thank you. You better be glad my brother here is gonna be the new mayor in this town, so he can afford to keep you in those nice dresses. Oh, Jackson, stop bragging on your family. She and her mother have only been here for a few hours, and she already knows you're the sheriff and your father was the mayor till he died. And John here will be the next mayor. I do declare, Leanne, be grateful you didn't grow up in this town. These boys were a terror. - Were they now? - Oh, absolutely. Especially my Jackson. He stayed in trouble. Yeah, well, I got the trouble gene, and my brother here got the book smarts gene. I'm proud of you, little brother. I wish Mama and Daddy had lived long enough to see you marry. I know they would have been proud. Proud of everything except you two eloping up there in Yankeetown. Well, Leanne insisted she didn't want a big spectacle. Why not? It should have been in all the papers. Well, all she wanted was him. Right, Leanne? How did you two meet? Oh, at college. I was working in the library. It was love at first sight if you ask me. I remember the first time she came home to tell me about him. I knew he was the one. I knew it. And they've been married three months now. I'd like to make a toast. To your parents and my George. May they rest in peace. Hear, hear! Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm, it's very good. Very good. Very good. Hey, what day... is it? I need to make a telephone call. Oh, well, ain't no telephone around here. Can you take me to one? The store closed. Willie Earl can take you tomorrow, but, you know, you ain't well, though. No. I promised your brother I would get him booked into the Capitol Royale in Chicago. That... I need to call them to see if there is an opening. Yeah, you can't do that now, so...

You ain't from around here. You shouldn't be in this part of town. - It's for coloreds. - Bayou, please? Please. There's an old mill up the road. Park behind it. Turn your lights off when you get there. How have you been? Now, Miss Leanne, you know it ain't right for no white woman to care how some darkie's doing. - You do think you're white, don't you? - Let me explain. Yeah, I was saving enough money to go to Boston to look for you. Thought you had got yourself in some kind of trouble. - I'm fit to be tied with you. - I sent you letters. I never got no letter from you. But I wrote you every week. Anybody with your last name. - Sometimes five times a week. - I never got 'em. I thought you moved on and married some girl. How could I do that when my heart only beat for you? Why didn't you leave with me? My mother. She told me she would go to the sheriff and tell him you did things to me if I didn't leave with her and never talk to you again. They were gonna kill you and burn down your mother's house. She would do it. I know she would. What was I to do? I didn't want you hurt. You have to leave here. If they know, they'll kill you and your mama. I told her that. She said she rather die here in that big house than poor and destitute in Boston. And she wanted me to marry a rich... white man. I don't even know how I got into this. I just... I just want out. I was 17. You love him? Do you? Not... like I love you. That ain't a no. He doesn't make me feel the way you do. Since we've been here, he's been different. - He's been mean... - Yeah. I... I... I don't know you. The gal I loved only had eyes for me. - What... what'd you come down here for? - Don't do this. - You know this is hard for me. - How you think I feel? Seeing you up there with that son of a bitch hugging you. Huh? That's Citsy coming to get me. She gonna go up and come back down, know I ain't there. I got to go. I got to go. Citsy? My Citsy? You're starting to sound like one of 'em. Whoa now. Whoa, whoa. Come on. Come on. Stop the car, Citsy. Come on now. Hey. - You drive. - Huh? Make me? Get off of me, gal. Get off of me. Man, just come on now. Get off of me and get in the car. Tell me where you coming from. I had to pee. That all right with you? So nosy. One day you're gonna thank me for nosing. - Why you late? - Oh, hey. None of your business. - Lord... - What? I'll drive by. We'll stop. You tell him she was coming to get you. - What you talking about? - Please, Citsy. Tell Jackson she was coming to pick you up. Who that is? What's she... what's she doing down here? Citsy! Hey, Miss Leanne. I'm sorry I didn't tell you I had a ride home. And you came all this way. But I'mma have your breakfast ready bright and early. Hey, Sheriff. Citsy. Aw, she was coming to pick me up. Now, you ain't gonna tell John, are you? Well... Now you and me both know what you doing down here, don't we? You watch who you talking to, gal. Now don't let me see you down here again, Leanne, or I will have to tell John. Yessir, Mr. Sheriff. Let the colored take care of their own. My, my, my. Yeah, no, no. No, this is great. No. This is great. Okay, okay. I... Thank you. Yeah, yeah. No. Uh, I... I understand. Yeah, we will, uh... we will. Thank you. Yeah, no, thank you. I, um... Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Um, we...

You know I work nights at Hattie Mae's. I need you to help me clean this floor. I mopped this floor an hour ago, ma'am. It's not good enough. Why are you just standing there? Help me get this stain up. I don't... I don't see no stain, ma'am. You do as I say. Yes, ma'am. Where do you think you're going? To change my dress, ma'am. I said, clean this now. Miss Leanne, this is my one good dress. How dare you? I'm sorry, Miss Bucket. Darling, what are you doing up so late? Is it the heat? She said she can't sleep, Mr. Clayton. Now sit right here, Miss Leanne. I'mma make you something to help you sleep. And I'mma get up this stain. Soon as I change my dress. You all right? It's the heat? You've been getting out of bed every night now. You'll get used to being here. I mean, this is my home. It's ours now. This is not my home. I'm going back to Boston. Well, uh... darling, if you left... you know how much embarrassment that would cause me? What would I say to everyone? Jackson? Hmm? To defend my good Clayton name, I would just tell everybody that we went for a swim in the Chattahoochee River and the current was too strong. Took you under. Now, you could have a good life here. Or no life at all. We gonna be leaving tomorrow. I'm going up to Chicago. Gonna play at the Capitol Royale. So y'all got it? Just an audition. I am worried. We need... more than him. Come on over here, Mama. You don't want to come, do you? Not on your life. Uh, Bayou, get that off the stove for me, please. Where's Citsy?

Jumping on his back at the truck. And you're jealous of that? That boy love you like breathing. He ain't even talked to another girl the whole time you've been gone. He been sick about you. Miss Leanne, look at me. It's a dangerous game y'all playing. Now, you can't do this. Y'all can't do this. You made your choice. A colored woman's life is hard. And it makes me wonder if... I could pass, would I? So part of me don't blame you. But most of me is scared for you. Citsy, wait. Can you do me a favor? - Can you give this to him? - I won't help you with this. Please. You're gonna get him killed. Please. Shit. Excuse me. Why are you so late? Be sure you know what you're doing. Just like old times. Nowhere near the same. Do you still want to take me away? With all my heart. I think he'll let me go if I tell him I'm a Negro. Oh no, don't... don't do that. Don't do that. Everybody in this town knows them boys' pride bigger than all Georgia. Promise me you ain't gonna do that. You'll make it hard for every colored person in Georgia if them boys know they've been fooled. And if something happen to you, they gonna have to kill me. - No. - Then don't tell them. I can't, um... I can't see you no more. Not like this. Bayou, you're all I've got. You are the only person that makes me feel safe. This ain't safe. I can't... I... I can't see you like this. And we go run away, you gonna... you need to let me save some money. Then we run off.

That washerwoman's boy. Somebody said he whistled at your wife when he was here today. N... That's not true. Citsy and I were the only ones here. - Who could have said that? - I did. I saw him. - Hattie Mae's boy. - That's the one. Come on, brother. We're gonna round up the boys. That's not so. He did not do that. - What, you saying your mama lying? - Yes. Yes, she is. Leanne. My wife's always been protective of the Negroes. Come on. Come on, darling. I'll drop you home. It's all right. These coloreds have lost their minds. - Stop them. Margaret... - Oh honey. There's no power on this Earth that can stop a proper Southern gentleman from defending his wife's honor. What did you do? What did you do? I saw you. I followed you to that mill. You letting that monkey lay on top of you. I warned you before. You will not ruin this life for us. - Where do you think you're going? - I'm telling them everything. - Leanne. - Everything! No! No! Where are the keys? Where are the keys? Don't you know that that boy will kill us? Look at the hate in his eyes when he sees coloreds. He will do it. You... are... evil. Get into the house. Get into the house. Citsy. You be sure and write me when you get there. Okay? Yes, ma'am. And Willie, you lay off that something, ya hear? I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine. Goodbye, Miss Hattie Mae. And thank you. Ira. I'll see y'all. Go! Go. Go! What's wrong with her? - You gotta go! - Citsy, what's the matter? - What? - They're coming for ya. Who coming? - What's going on? - Her mama. Her mama said you whistled at her. - Leanne and... - Go! - Where is she? - Just go! - Where she at? - She fine. They don't know. They're coming after you. What about you? You know I pay that sheriff. I'll be fine. Get in the car. - Go! - They don't know... Oh! Go. Lord. - And that's what happened. - Lord. Oh Lord! That'll get them killed dead. I know, I know, I know. I know. There they is. - Where is he? - Where's who? Don't you play with me. Your boy. Well, they ain't here. What you want with them? Are you lying to us? No, sir, Sheriff. They left here this morning. Went out west or something, to California. - Let's burn it down. Burn it down! - Yeah! You won't let them burn down my house, Sheriff. After all the money we done made at my place. You watch your mouth. - Where they at? - He's not here. Let's burn it down. He ain't here. Let's check the train station or the county line. He can't be too far away. - Let's go, boys. - All right, let's go! Please, God, please. Citsy. Ain't no cars here, so I guess they still looking for him, but he got away. Thank God. Thank God. I was praying. If they did something to him, I would have stayed here for the rest of my life... in misery. And it would be what I deserve. I quit. No. Look, ain't no way I can stay here. None. Now, I'm sorry, Miss Leanne. - I wish you well in this struggle. - Please. Please. If you leave, I've got nobody. Citsy, don't go, please. Don't leave me here all by myself, please. Are you hungry? Can't eat nothing. I wanna go back. I just left like a coward. I left them there. - Stop... stop the car. - What? Wait! Bayou! Here. Wait. Wait. When I was in Germany not long ago, my family and I were sent to live in what was called a ghetto by the German Army because... because we were Jews. The conditions were terrible. Everything we had was stolen. There was no food. Everyone was starving. Early one morning, we were awakened to the sound of the Nazis screaming, "Wake up, Jews. Wake up, you stinking Jews." We did not know it at the time, but they had been given orders. Every Jew who was unable to work was to be killed. And so they promised us that we were to be moved to better conditions. And we all boarded these... train cattle cars. Many people. Many people. For days. In one little car. My wife and child were with me, and we were sent to these... camps. And we had to be... tested to see if we were... fit to work. Of course, my wife, Franca, could not be tested while holding our daughter, so they shot her and my little girl right before my eyes. Uh, this ain't making me feel no better. I'm telling you this. Sometimes you have to just go on so that you can come back to help. I couldn't help... my family. But I helped... I helped many people. Your mother, she is a smart woman. She knows how to survive. And once you learn that too, how to survive... then you will be able to help her. Let us go on. Dear Mama. We made it to Chicago. This place is like downtown everywhere. Ain't never seen nothing like this in all my life. Ira was so nervous for this thing he called an "audition" to get this job. Wait here. - Ira, you're a persistent man. - Yes. Thank you. - Those are your boys? - Yes. - They are here, and they are excellent. - Uh, yes, well... We have rehearsal here, so, uh, call my office next week. Yes, okay, but I was hoping... Uh... - Yes, but we... They... - Call me. I'm busy. I'm in a rehearsal! Can you believe that? Where are you going? Willie! - Where is Willie? Where did he go? - I don't know. Okay, you come. You sing. What? I can't sing here. This ain't no juke joint. Listen to me. You want to help your mother? Leanne? Then you sing. You think of her, and you sing. Okay. I'm... What song? Anything. Anything that makes you think of her. Just sing. - That's it. Take five.

"Dear Bayou, your mama asked me to write you this letter." "She wanted you to know that she doing fine, and she loves you and misses you." "Everything seems to have calmed down here, and life is kind of back to normal." "And she say, don't worry about her. You just take care of you, and she hope you and Willie Earl is doing good." "And we miss you, and we love you. Citsy." - Yeah, she... she doing all right. - Yes. Yeah, thank God. She... she ain't mention nothing about Leanne. I am sure she is fine. I am sure of it. Yeah, I need... I need to send Mama some... some money. Need to write her a letter. Ira. What the hell is this, now? How the hell they gonna put his name out there on the marquee? That's supposed to say "Willie Earl Boyd," not "Bayou." The people, they are coming to see your brother. Mr. Carney said that business is up over 30% since he started singing. You said they like us, and they wanted us for Capitol Royale. No. They said they liked Bayou, and they wanted him for Capitol Royale. You walked out, or do you not remember? It wasn't easy. I managed to get us a package deal. Okay. Then I'm just going to have a talk with them then. You'll not speak with them. How in the hell you gonna tell me who I ain't gonna talk to? I do not care who you speak with, but you will not speak with Mr. Carney. You will not ruin this opportunity for us. Please. Hey, hey, don't you be gettin' mad at me. I ain't done you nothing.

See, I done worked my ass off to get here. Now finally, where my name's supposed to be, my own damn brother done gonna put his. If anybody took your name, it's that mess you're pushing up your arm. The Negro race be a whole lot better off if you just went on back to... Georgia. Let 'em hang your black ass. Dear Mama. We doing all right up here in Chicago. Every chance I get, I been sending you a letter. Hope you've been getting them. Ira helped me get an apartment. I wish you could see it. It's really nice. Nicer than what we had down there. Every night, the line getting longer and longer at the Capitol Royale. People coming from all over the world, Mama. You should see all these white folk. Kinda remind me of the time I saw all the colored people come to your place. It's something to see. Oh, it is something to see. I really hope you've been getting the money I've been sending to you. I'mma keep sending it. I really wish you all would tell me how Leanne doing. Ain't heard nothing from nobody about nothing. Hope she doing all right and that she's safe. Ira and Mr. Carney even had me make a record called "Paper Airplane." Mama, I gotta tell you, can't wait for you to hear it. He tell me it's doing pretty well too. Willie Earl, Mama, we still fighting all the time. Make me even miss you so much more. And Mama, he got it real, real bad.

We'd be out of there before you know it. I will go and bring her here. She don't want to come here. I have to go there. I do not think that is a good idea. You said yourself, I don't look like that poor little colored boy that left. And what if they know?
