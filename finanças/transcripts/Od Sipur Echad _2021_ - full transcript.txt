we were inspired by the book "Wedding Pressure" by Omer Barak עוד סיפור אחד Od Sipur Echad O N E M O R E S T O R Y No. thanks, I dont need Its for your armpit. Have you been waiting for a long time? No, not at all. There was a line, someone was stuck there. Really? - Yeah, no. I heard crying from inside the booth, so... I gave her a pad. Even if you did a number two, thats completely fine. No, but thats not the case. - Obviously its not. -No. I think I overshared. It happens to me sometimes, I overshare or talk too much or just... Its so hot in here. Excuse me. Can you turn on the air conditioning? Its on full, its a nightmare. Its great that you came, really. Im very happy. Cute place, huh? Yeah, awesome, air-conditioned. You want to order? - We havent looked yet. What do you have? Indian food. Indian food? Yeah, you like Indian food? Did you choose it? Everyone likes Indian food, right? Yeah, no, of course. I just cant have two tastes simultaneously. What do you have without two tastes simultaneously? Rice. - Rice, then. Yeah, rice, well take... Well have a side dish meal. - Yeah. Like, one of each. One of each rice. Yeah. Yeah. Nice, you have a rice based meal. Youre actually a date with my grandma, Friday. Sexy. Wait, didnt we order dr... Why does she keep going? Excuse me. I need water. She doesnt see me. Excuse me! I need water. Dont look at me. Get up and leave. - Is it supposed to be there? Is that how it works? I dont know. - Get up. -I... I dont have sisters, so I dont know. - Get up and leave. I knew its a mistake, by the way. - Wow. -Everyone saw its... Dont touch it. - I dont want to. Please... -I dont want to. - And just... -But Im a little curious. Its nothing. I have way more embarrassing things happen to me on dates. - Makes no sense. One time, I wanted to take someones eyelash, and it was still attached to her face. Yeah, its nothing compared to what just happened. Want me to do something embarrassing so were even? No, I dont. - Ill do it, not problem. I dont. Im not afraid of these things. - Im not interested. Nobody knows me here. - Im not interested. No, no. No! Did anyone lose a pad? I found a pad. Put it down. - Anyone? Put it down. - No? Must be mine. My bad. - Why? -Sorry. Everyone looked. Every person sitting here just looked at me. Want more embarrassment? - I dont want anything. I was IDFs first male welfare NCO. What do you mean? You were a welfare NCO? Male welfare NCO, first one in the IDF. There was also a Druze guy, but he couldnt take it. Dropped out to go to the infantry. And there are no others? Today there are, but I was the first one. I was the Alice Miller of welfare NCOS, I pave the way, as they say. You see? Its all so embarrassing. That's why I didnt go on dates for about five years, because everythings so unnatural and pretentious and... I went on enough dates for both of us during the last two years. Maybe youre the problem. Sorry, I didnt mean it. It was a little... - No, thats fine. That's fine. - Too fast. Sorry. - No, thats legitimate. That's the problem with dating at this age, it always looks like... If he didnt find anyone by now, there must be something wrong with him. Maybe hes fucked up. No, youre supposed to say its not true. -Okay. Its slightly true. Look, I have a proposition. Were not young. I mean, Im not young. Youre young. Youre very young. I mean, why dont we jump straight to the fifth date? Not sexually, no, instead of trying to impress each other, just... lets tell each other how much we suck. Put it all on the table. Interesting. You want a list? A typical story? Well tell share the worst thing weve done? Something like that. Okay. Who goes first? Wow. What? - Wow, youre... wow. What, did you expect me to go first? - Okay, yeah. Coward, never mind. Do a... Im tails. Whats tails? Is it the number? The picture. - So yeah, that. Why do you have coins? Its Bitcoin. Heads. - Stop! No, no. I had a pad in my armpit. Okay, okay. I hope you have time, because its a long story. Siri, cancel all my appointments, please. Calling mother. No, abort, abort. Okay, so it was in a time when I was someones... not exactly partner. I was in a relationship with... not exactly... Okay, III start from the book. It was in a time when I wrote my book. You wrote a book? - Yeah, Im telling you about it. All my life I wanted to write a book, its has been my dream forever, but when I tried to do it, it didnt really work, because my life was a mess and the biggest distraction from writing was Amos. Hello there. Did you order sex? Amos, its not a good time. Ill talk to you, okay? Are you kidding me? Do you know how long it took me to find a parking spot? Theres someone here, so... Really? Good for you. Okay, III go. - Bye, thanks. Come on already. You think I believed you? - Come on... Besides, I would never give up on that parking spot. What? Look at you panting. Whats wrong with you? - What? What did you do in the IDF? I was exempted from service, eczema. And I had a rich father. But I still have my jump wings. - Youre so corrupted. Wait, wheres the eczema? Never mind, dont tell me. Hello? Yeah, no, I didnt forget. Im in a meeting with advertisers. Of course, the moment Im out of here. Absolutely. Bye. I have to go pick up my kid. Hes 21, so if its a meeting with advertisers, I want to advertise my services as a clichae. A young woman who sleeps with a married man. So youve been with a married man, thats not that great. I would expect more. You havent heard anything. Im going. Whatsthat? - Whats that? Is that the book? - The book... its the current draft, still waiting for you to read it and express your opinion. I read it. I mean, I started, Im... But its great, its really great. Say, hows it going? I got another no from a publisher -Who? Rami Levi Fiction. Its good and youre good and it will happen. Listen, it must happen. I believe in you big time. - You didnt even read it. I dont have to, I know how good your writing is. - Sure. Okay, got to go. Are you going to tell me a lot about having sex with other guys? You said its the fifth date, right? - Oka, I thought that maybe there are things that can wait until after the wedding. What happened two years ago? - What? You said youre going on dates for two years, so what happened two years ago? Get it. Theres no beer in there, I see theres no beer. Its only your enlarged nostrils. Okay, so what happened two years and three drinking hours ago? Maybe its not two years. Its a year. A year and a half... a year and nine months. So youre really precise about it. Okay, so what happened a year and nine months ago? Just someone. The classic story? She broke your heart, and since then nobodys quite like her? Were not in my story now, right? Were in your story. Party pooper. Okay, so... It was comfortable with Amos. We exploited each other, but I mainly didnt want to be like those sticky, annoying couples around me. Good morning. - Top of the morning to you. Great morning. What would you like? Coffee, very strong. One regular coffee. - One regular coffee. May I recommend our Mideastern cauldron? Its two slices of bread, a tomato, tuna and mayo. You just described a tuna sandwich. Its a cauldron. - Its our cauldron. Never mind, not interested. - Okay, whats your name? Im here every morning. I know. Yarden. Idan the girl. Here you go. Are you a couple? Can you tell? Is that a hickey? Did you give me a hickey in the mixing spoon stand? Ill kill you, you told me its a cheeky kiss. What hickey? Youre red as a cherry every time I pass by you, so she can tell. - Ima cherry? Youre going around smiling like you won the jackpot. I really won the jackpot. The day I saw you on the escalator. - Quiet. So stop harassing me with those eyes that take off my apron. I could sue you for harassment. - 1 could sue you for harassment. I could sue you for harassment. I dont understand how you do it, you work here together all day long, smell each others sweat, then you go home together, what do you talk about, coffee? No, we have lots of conversation topics. - We have a variety of topics. We... - TV shows and... Netflix. - Netflix. How long have you been together? Five months. - What do you mean, five months? Im counting since I removed my cast. Weve been going out for four months. - Oh, four months, okay. I had urinary tract infections that lasted longer than that. Thanks. - Where are the newspapers? Nobody reads those anymore. We stopped getting them. Look in the app. I worked for a large newspaper. Human-interest stories, sponsored articles, lots of pictures, a little bit of text. The meeting is over. - In a nutshell, I made a living by entertaining people at hair salons or while they waited in line for facelifts. Hi. - Hi. Sorry, its because of those two freaks at the coffee shop. Why do you keep going... We have a coffee machine. I dont know, its like a study in sociology. Did you know they dont have newspapers there anymore? Oh, really? Good thing you noticed. Weve been losing readers for 12 year old girls stories. Wait, he was your boss? What years are we talking about? Was it consensual? Is he in jail? - That's exactly the problem, when youre... When youre in it, you dont realize whats wrong. It doesnt make you a shitty person, vice versa. Wait. Good thing you noticed. Weve been losing readers for 12 year old girls stories, and thats exactly why I want to talk to you about the next Passover issue. Want us to celebrate Passover at your place or at my place this year? - Yarden. What? Nobody can hear. Im just... a worker getting instructions from her boss, where he wants to hide the Afikoman. I really want to talk about work. Sit down, come on. Okay. That's new. - Look. We need a boost, something big, something people will talk about, so we decided that for the next Passover, which is the wedding holiday... No, I think the wedding holiday is Shavuot. No, Shavuot is cheese and water or whatever they throw there. No, thats the Giving of the Torah. Really, like, Open Google, look at the bible. Never mind. Anyway, people hardly get married during Passover. Its the counting of the Omer until Lag BaOmer. -Whatever. So for that holiday we made up were going to do... Youre going to do a big story, okay? That's how its going to be. Were going to take someone, have him go on dates for a month nonstop until he finds the one. You know they already invented reality TV. So what? My mother still has an answering machine and a fax. Amos, romance is obsolete, fthats why people dont get married anymore. I dont care, the board of directors wants something big, and thats what well bring them. Board of directors... You can say dad. I dont call him dad since I was eight years old, its either Zvika or the board of directors. Anyway, youre going to have a team of researchers, and Im talking about hackers here, like in the Israeli intelligence corps, okay? They can find a match for anyone. We can make an app out of it eventually. That's how you make the big money. Good morning, Amos. - Good morning, Yarden. -Hi. Here. I squeezed you an extra one. Thanks. Yarden is going to do the story. - I havent agreed yet. 20 reasons your man has sweaty palms? Dubrovnik, not what you thought? No? Who put cranberries in my salad? The story about dating, Gadi, we talked about it. Good for you. We should do that story about Dubrovnik too some day, they pay a lot there. Did you open the email I sent you? Dont, its a virus. Just dont forget the advertiser event tomorrow. I promised that were all going to be there. Have a great day. Sorry. How is that person above me in the hierarchy? He makes me look good while I play squash. Do you know what workers committees hes bringing us? The Israel Electric Corporation advertises in our newspaper thanks to him. - Why do they need ads? Their only competition is the sun. Amos, find someone else to do that story, really. Yarden, you know youre the best. You know what? Well make a deal. Youll help me with this story, get me something big, something people will talk about, something that sells... Jand I help publish your book. What do you say? Youre a son of a bitch. And you love me. Okay. Now I have to find someone stupid enough to go on those dates. Meet Adam, a good friend of mine, the sweetest person in this office, hell help you even if he really doesnt want to. On Saturday, I made your mushroom quiche. Its to die for, its the first time people ate the whole dish. Great, Im glad, Aliza. If you werent homosexual, you would have loved to set you up with my daughter. What? Adam is a hopeless romantic or just a hopeless person, you know, someone who shows his feelings and does it all the way, and needless to say, it didnt really help him in life. He started working in our office after it didnt work out for him in the sports section. And now, after taking Hapoel Beer Sheva to new heights, and just before hes trying to conquer the British kingdom too, Peretz finally reaches the big stop in the life of every man. His wedding. The wedding bells went off in his head when he saw model Linor Mizrahi at the other end of the bar. When I ask him about the attribute he likes the most about her, he just gets that foggy look on his face. What is that? Eyes in the fall, you know. Sparkling... - Sparkling my ass! I send you to do a story about Maor Peretz and thats what you come back with? Its an interview for his wedding. Fuck his wedding. Here, I take my cock, put it in an envelope and send the young couple. - Why... Where do you think you work, at a womens magazine? At the weddings and fun page of Kfar Saba? He fucking signed a contract in England, the largest contract for an Israeli player ever. This shithead is swimming in baths of Euros. Pounds. - Shut the fuck up! -Okay. You come and bullshit me about his fucking prenup with his bimbo. Come here. Come, take a look. What does every man think when he sees this picture? Good thing they found each other? Fuck him and what I would do to her... And instead of giving your readers something to dream about at night... I can maybe... - You can maybe step down, Nikko will remake the story. Youre back to the lower level leagues. Are you relegating me? He had a problem, he was always sure theres a thing called true love. He would spend ours imagining the perfect wedding. He would actually wait for the one to come on the pink unicorn and... - I get it, the office loser. I can identify. - No, not a loser. Hes cute. Besides, you and him... You dont understand. - I do. Imagine a kid with tons of acne whos sure his girlfriend is Lara Croft. The singer? Lara Croft. Character, computer. But Adam had a talent you couldnt take away from him. Hes a perfect cook. Good morning... You bitc... Anyway, the advertiser evening came, and I decided to have him do that story. How can Hugh Grunt play a loser? I mean, come on. Well never make it, we missed the whole thing. Who cares? No, really, its Hugh Grunt. Hes hot, gorgeous, British, with godly hair. Whats not to like? That's the nice thing about these films, they all look good but theyre fucked up. It doesnt work that way in real life. Its all about supply and demand. You need to increase the demand. Okay, youre saying that like its a button that you have to press and everythings alright. You just described Tinder. But its more for people who... have one night stands, right? Is that how you say it? Have one night stands? Yeah, thats how you say it, youre really hip. Its not bad for me to be alone, okay? I know its temporary. Im just waiting for the one, and its obvious that shell come. That's the way it is. - Okay, Elsa. Or is it Anna? Whos the one with the song? - Elsa. Love is something that happens, you know it happens. Two people can fall in love in five seconds. It might sound unrealistic and archaic, but it happens. Adam, when was your last relationship? Eti Abada? Okay, you used a last name. What grade was it? Seventh grade. Bar Mitzva? - No, before that, I skipped grade. Okay. When was your last date? Real date? Not being in an elevator together by chance? A date where she knows who I am? Okay. So I have an idea. Not interested! Come on, it will be a great experiment and an incredible story. Fucking heels. Adam, would you stop for a second? Now listen. We have a month to print, and for a month, only for a month, Ill handle your dates, III hit on them for you and you dont think that every girl is the one, because tomorrow there will be another one, two more, a million more. Okay, Yarden, thats really a great idea, but why me? Take someone else. - Because youd be a perfect fit, really. Ill set up your dates and youll write about them. That's going to be your big story. - Yarden, stop, Im not interested. I dont want a million dates. It sounds like a pain. It means seeing a million girls disappointed that Im not... I dont know, Hugh Grunt. - Okay, technically, Hugh Grunt is like 85 now, so... - Say, was anyone ever disappointed just by seeing you? Do you even know how it feels? Who ordered the Biryani rice? Me. Okay, a break. Go buy popcorn. Wait, what? -Bon appaetit. - Thanks. -Thanks. When exactly are you a shitty person here? And towards who? Gadi? Adam? Amos? - Wait, wait, wait. Ive been talking nonstop here about very personal things. Maybe youre a psychopath? Maybe youll expose my story? What do you actually do? In TV. - Come on. Seriously, I work in TV. What do you do in TV? Im saying that to impress, but I work behind the scenes. What, a make-up artist? Yeah, Im a make-up artist. No. If you watch the news and theres a poll or a soccer match or something, and there are all sorts of columns with statistics and data, I enter the data. Off the top of your head? Are you savant? No. They give me the data. Oh. -I just type them. - So you just type things. No, I need to understand it... Yeah, I type things. - Okay. Lara Croft would be proud of you, although it sounds like a really cute job. You get to watch all the games, you know the election results before anybody else. Its not that interesting. I mean, numbers are interesting. That's why you could tell me its been exactly a year an nine months? Did you know that youre supposed to eat rice with your hands? But you dont do it because thats how your people goes extinct because of dysentery? No, really. Try it. I dont want to. - Its an experience, try it. No. - Try it, why not? Try it. Not a single grain. Come on, take it with your hand. Put your hand. Really, really take. I was just kidding about the rice. Nobody eats like that. - What an idiot, moron. What about Adam? Did he agree? Yeah, he agreed. I mean... Not exactly. Wait. What do you... - For the profile. What? - Adam, great, youre here! Whats up? Did you sleep here? - I did. Come, meet everyone. - What do you mean? What are you doing? We started working on the story. - What? What story? The story. Adam, meet... the Einats. Hello. - Hello. Hi. Youre both called Einat? Of course not, they have real names. Im Michal and thats... - Exactly, but we call them The Einats. Im Bosem. - Why? Because they operate the El NAT system, which is a Hebrew acronym for... Matching data interception station. Everything is on the internet, basically. The system just classifies the information and crosschecks it with other user data so we could find the perfect match for you. Is that legal? Did the newspaper always have that? Adam, chill out, of course its legal. Basically, its the digital marketing system, they gather data about all the Facebook members... Never mind, its... Its legal, keep explaining. When we put your data into the system, lets say youre 6 feet tall with a BMI of 37, nose to eye ratio of 4.3, Oedipus complex, still active on Friendster, follows the cast of Saved by the Bell on Instagram... What? -We get all the single women from the central region who are interested in a person with your initial data. Wait, its not... Somethings wrong here, wait a second. Oh, yeah. Adam, youre what we call in our jargon a lost cause, no chance for success, a Gamma male, with a potential for an asexual relationship. A failure. - I get it, thanks. We improve your profile, have conversations for you and get you a first date with a 98 percent certainty. - You speak for me? No, Yarden, Im really uncomfortable with it. Its an impersonation. These are the first 17 going by the order of dates. 17? 17 girls agreed to date me? E were all surprised. Where do I sign? Here. - Oh, theres an actual contract. Yeah, Gadi insisted, but read it properly. Yeah, yeah. Now, Adam, go get me my story. And maybe find the love of my life. Yeah, that too. Everything was ready. Adam was underway, the story was underway, my book was underway, but I didnt know that somewhere, in a dark, damp place, or in Rehovot... Actually, thats a pretty precise description of Rehovot, hides a scientist thats going to ruin all my plans, Maya Shaked. 57 feet of brains surrounded by some human. What are we doing wrong? Its 22:00 and were talking to rats. What are we doing wrong? We cant say we have a case with seven successes out of eight. Sure we can, those are great percentages, 34 point... Theres a point there, right? Remind me how you became a scientist. They had not more spots in the Pilates instructor course. With those percentages they wont fund our research. Lets go drink something and talk about something else. Abigail, I have write lots of summaries, III continue at home. This research is finished anyway, even Ada would give you a night off. Right, Ada? Ada didnt take a night off, Abigail. She went into her lab, and after 15 years of research she came out... A virgin. - With a Nobel prize. Okay, back to Adam. We quickly realized that Adam wont succeed in any date. So in order for it to work, the Einats had to mess with the data a little, so we kind of hed. We just... lied a lot. You know, you dont look like your picture. Yeah, its a different era. Wheres the snake tattoo from the Burning Man festival? It was eaten by a vulture tattoo. Go. - Did you change tires? Go. - Okay. First of all, thanks, but just so you know, next time, you should wear a yellow vest. Its very dangerous. - There wont be a next time. Oh? - There wont be a next time. Youll never change tires again and theres not going to be another date? Go already! And thats it, then I decided to leave everything, quit my job and go back to living with my dad. That was her best decision. The amazing thing is, its not even fat based, its all cashew based. What? Im allergic to nuts. Hello? -Why are you home? Why are you not on a date? Because Im exhausted, Yarden. Its not working. Give it another chance. You should have written that story about me. You know what horrible dates Ive had? Dear god... But I am writing it on you. Who sent you? Your girlfriend from a year and nine months ago. She wasnt my girlfriend. She was my wife. That's good to know. What... how long have you been married? In total? Three days. - Wow, okay. Im not sure thats better. Yeah, thats not something I usually share on a first date. But Im special. - Yeah. I never understood how that happens. Suddenly, after the wedding, you realize its not working? Youre in the hotel, and suddenly you fight about the air-conditioning? No, we knew it before, but we didnt want to disappoint our families, they really waited for that wedding, so... We decided its better that way. You decided? I was there when she decided. I nodded my head. Shes married today, has a little girl/ So fast? 55 percent of couples who cancel their wedding get married the following year. At least you have the statistics. Whats wrong, is it spicy? No, of course not. Its better that way, right? You shouldnt be in an empty relationship. Youre better off here, with me, being embarrassed... this is spicy as hell. I know, I saw you. - That's really spicy. That's spicy, I need bread. Want that? Its over... - I have nothing here, give me that. Whats that, a rice cake? Whats that? Is that bread? Whats that? Look at that. That's nothing. That's spicy... That's the most spicy thing ever. Take the rice, this rice. This one? - That's the only one thats not spicy. There you go, keep telling me about Adam. Well take comfort knowing that guy had more embarrassing dates than me. Hes a little like me. No. Youre different. Come on, tell me how you abused him. No, I didnt abuse him, I really appreciated him for what hes doing. That Adam is such a loser, unbelievable. No, really, just a failure, it doesnt matter whos in front of him. Read another one. - Okay. This week he went on a date with someone called Rinat. Rinat. - A pelvic floor rehabilitation instructor. Pelvic floor? - Yeah, they did squats and he pulled his coccyx. His coccyx? How does that happen? What an idiot, my god. - Listen. Then there was Tanya, Shes a magicians assistant, they sat there for an hour and a half. Stop, dont tell me. And then she went poof and disappeared. And Shir, whos a vegan, and they took a boat ride in the lake and he accidentally killed a duck with an oar? What an idiot, my god. With an oar? How did he manage that? Arent you going to close the door? No, thats the nice thing about us, we have nothing to hide. Yeah, besides everything. What? Besides everything. We beat the system, Yarden! Yeah. - What? You have to get your prostate checked. Keep going. What is he up to? What does he do today? I dont know. Lets call and see what hes up to. Hey. - Hey, Adam. How was your date with Naomi, the orderly? Good. -Really? Great. Okay, so Im setting up another one. Hello, Adam? Adam... Im going. When did you... Bye. - Bye. Shit. Fuck... - Shit, sorry. Fuck, fuck. Im sorry, you just came out of nowhere. I didnt see you. - Are you okay? Do you need anything? Me? I ran you over, I... No. - You just came... sorry. Youre completely right. - You came out of nowhere. Im really sorry, I didnt see you. - Someone should signal when hes going down the stairs, and I wasnt wearing glowing clothes. - Are you okay? Im great. Never felt better. Foot hurts a little and... and my heart and Im a little dizzy, I feel a little... Ill just sit here for a while, okay? Its an emergency. Excuse me, whats going on here? - He had an accident. I was driving. I take full responsibility. - It was completely my fault. I was walking recklessly on the sidewalk. - I insist that you state that Im to blame. I was on the phone. - The accident protocol has to say that he was using a crosswalk. His pupils arent dilated, but a head injury is suspected. It doesnt count. - Hes confused, he looks very tired. I feel fine. - Hes not focused, he talks without context, without any context. - That's my usual way of speaking. That's the way I talk. - I dont think he has increase intercranial pressure. Me neither. - But you should do a CT scan. Would you sit down please? Sorry. You can go if you want to. No way. Its almost over. Want some coffee, maybe? We have time. I dont drink coffee. Tea? Sparkling water? A croissant, maybe? Im sure they have something here. - I dont eat at night. Even not... - No. But you can if you want, its really fine. - No. Youre right. Its a hospital, so its probably not... I hate this place. Really? I thought you worked here. I dont work with people. What? My mom was hospitalized here. - I see. So now shes... - Dead. In the... dead. Wow. Sorry, I wasnt... I wasnt laughing about that, its not... Its like when they sound the remembrance siren. So what do you do? Im a neurologist. Wow, way to go. Girl power! Sorry, I... Im sorry, Im usually normal. I mean, normal like... Im not usually life that Must be the pills they gave me. What, Paracetamol? No, but they also gave me... Its water. Really? Wow. That's good. Probably enhanced. Straight to the vein too. Its funny we met that way, huh? One moment you walk on the street, the next moment you... Okay, Berkowitz, you were lucky. No severe internal injuries, but since your kidneys were hit, some side effects may appear, so please come back here if any of them happen. -Okay. Youre the... Dizziness, nausea, vomiting. fat'9ue. Diarrhea. And its very important to take care of that, because you may have a problem with bowl and bladder control during the next few days, so if its watery, if its a little green... Okay, I get it, thanks. So what do I do now? - Now you can go. You can take crutches from... - No, thats okay, this is great. Thanks, doctor. But be mindful of your stool. Even if its just a strong odor or... Increased activity, be aware. Okay, I didnt forget you. Ill give you an enema and then well talk about everything. Okay? The copy of the receipt. Did you pay for my hospitalization? That's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. The least I can do is invite you to have coffee with me. I dont you, I dont... - No coffee, right, you said. So something else? A liquid you can have? Not in a sexual way. Not that I put that thought in your head right now, I just want to put something in your mouth. Wow. - Wow. That was horrible. And anyway, its 4:00 AM, were not going back to sleep. Anyway, you ran me over, so I can still sue. Its nice here. Wait, is he singing? Yeah, hes singing, like an idiot. Okay... Want more water maybe or... Shawarma? Its really late, | think III go. Okay. Just... I had a good time. Me too. Tomorrow Adam came with sparkling eyes and told me about Maya, and then we went to the banquet hall where hes supposed to get married to the one hes supposed to meet at the end of this whole thing, but with Maya in his head and butterflies in his stomach Adam started getting cold feet. No, thats crazy. That's... Just a wedding. Just a wedding, Yarden? Its a lifetime commitment. Its a one time decision. - Are you listening to yourself? Its been 200 years since someone took a wedding so seriously. People are more loyal to their phone than their partner. Who cares who youre getting married to? In two years youre going to get divorced0 or go to some party where three men will bang her while youre watching. Why would I watch? - Its outdated, its going to disappear like video libraries, like DVDs. I love watching DVDs. A wild night? Really, I made myself laugh. Oh, my god. Listen, can you come take a look at those results... - Okay, what the hell? Nothing. I ran over some guy yesterday. You met a guy? - I ran over a guy with my bicycle. Okay, a little difficult, but we all did it. Well, is he cute? What? Why does it matter? Why are we talking about it? Because you didnt say no. - No, hes not cute. Wow, Abigail. Its really not... - Whats his name? Why does it matter? Youre calling him. - No way Im calling him. Oh, my god. You got his number? - I didnt... Abigal, we exchanged details. We have two weeks to find you a girl and make her marry you, and Im here to help you do it. - Yeah, but what are the chances... And then, suddenly, something happened out of Adams unrealistic romantic comedies. Hello? - Hello? Its Maya. Maya called, get it? Julia Roberts of the Weizmann Institute called Adam exactly a second after I told him that he has to get married in two weeks and get divorced after 30 minutes. What are the odds? 0.75. Okay, I didnt really ask, its a figure of speech. Hello? Is it the girl from yesterday? Speak, then. - Hello? Hello? Hi, hi. Hi! Hi. Hi, I... I just called to see if... Just, you know, the worst effects are usually in the morning... Is everything okay? Define okay. No dizziness? Nausea? Colored diarrhea? Im glad everythings fine. Do you want to meet today? - If I want to meet today... Well do whatever you want. We dont even have to call it... Okay, okay, okay. Yeah? Really? - Yeah, sure. Okay, so I... Ill pick you up... Well schedule later? - Sure. Okay. So... bye? - Bye. Congratulations! So Adam went to Maya so after what happened in the gas station theyll also have a normal date, but as you understand, with Adam nothings really normal. Maya? Maya? Maya? Maya? What happened? What did you do? Me? Your kitchen was on fire and I broke in, and now you have a rat on the table. Itzik, come here. Itzik? What... Do you want to tell me why you tried to burn your own house? I didnt. I wanted to make myself dinner. I didnt know... - You call that dinner? Its a dinner you know exactly what to expect of and how many minutes it will take to prepare. Do you know how much time that saves? Okay, were not going out. What? Im cooking for you. I dont want to brag, but with several staple items you have in every fridge... Okay, thats the scariest thing I have ever seen. And then they decided to spend the night where all big love stories begin, in the supermarket. Do you know that nobody ever cooked for me? Not even when I was a child. Why, because your mom... - Died? No, even when she was alive, she never cooked. Were several generations of women who dont cook. In Israel people find it strange. What do you mean, in Israel? We came to Israel when I was four. Three women who cant cook. Ive been eating mostly out of my freezer. I also love microwave pizza, outside its always so hot and in the middle its frozen, I loved it so much. Wow, thats... - Sad. -No. Like my mother. She also didnt cook, but out of principle. Shes a feminist, to be specific, gender studies department head in the university. She always wanted a girl, and instead she got a fat boy, heterosexual, normal. Youre not normal. You could have said not fat. What did you put there, mint, paprika? Chili and turmeric and soy. Together with the sweetness of the tomatoes it... Sounds like Ratatouille. What? Its a rat that cooks, a film. Youll love it. Wow, you have a lot of things to catch up on. Is there any left? No wonder youre hungry all the time, until now you ate lightweight cement. That explains the hair loss. That's a joke. Okay. Not funny, a little shocking, but good to know... this option exists. Whats that? The oven timer. I have a timer in my oven? - Ill get the brownies. There are brownies? So.. What... - The brownies. -Yeah. Say, so what... Hows your mentoring project going? Great. You wont believe it. He met someone completely by himself, and I think theres a potential for a bride. Without the Einats? Like a normal person? An interaction with a normal female human? No, its some scientist, some brain researcher, I dont know. And theres going to be a wedding? Yeah. I mean, I dont know, but even if theres no wedding, he found love, happy end. No, the story is about a guy who marries a vase for all I care, thats how we sold it. Gadi found sponsors. - Okay, fine. Well have a wedding. The Einats are making sure that the dates are interested, Im only saying if it doesnt work out... \ -What do you think of those? Theyre nice, yeah. - No, no. Which one would you prefer if you had to choose a cover for your book? That one, totally. Its best suited for the content, right? Yeah. Whatever you think. Im shocked that you didnt read it. - What? I read it. There are letters, its also numbered. - Great. What? I dont understand. You wanted your book published? Its published. Why does it matter if I read it or not? Because youre... Because were... Youve had it for month, and you... Okay, because its important for me to know what the man... The man whos about to send this cover to the graphics department? Moti, listen, Im sending you a file. Leave everything youre doing and take care of it ASAP, okay? No, dont call Asaf. ASAP, in English. So just do it, okay? Oh, and most importantly, she loved the brownies. Who said brownie? Brown sugar stamped his passport and hes on his way to you. You made her brownies for a first date? You slut... well. She ate it. And... - No, no way. You didnt sleep after you cooked for her? Im in bed after you buy me cracker nuts. Adam, sex is like a handshake. If you didnt sleep, theres no deal. That's what I always say. Why is everyone a part of this conversation? A part... listening. Active. -Passive. - Im passive. You know Im not into one night stands. For me sex is not just a handshake, its... Shes just so... I dont want to ruin it, I need more time. Cool, no problem, just dont take too long. In two weeks youre getting married. By the way, thats a great story for the newspaper, shes into it, shes not, and why does she always have a rat by her bed? I thought that maybe I shouldnt do this story, because I really like her and I dont want to ruin it and... Whats up, man? Yarden told me youre going to get us a great story. Yeah, were just talking about it, Amos, so... - Yeah. Theres a reason they say youre married to your job. Gadi wont stop talking about you. Its going to be one of our greatest things. And who knows? Maybe well sell your story to Netflix. Nice, but I just told Yarden that... That Adam is really excited about the story, its going to change his life. Great, Yarden. Great. Good. You see? The train has left the station. Nothing you can do. Yeah, but we can do it with an alias. Maybe someone else from the staff can... - Stop, Adam. Stop, get a grip, youre doing it again. - What? You like someone a little and you can throw away everything for her. Really, what do you know about this Maya? Shell dump you after two days, I know, I recognize it, and then youll lose both her and the story, which is a huge opportunity for your career. Look, it has such funny things. - What do you mean, funny? I mean, interesting and exciting and... Never mind, dont throw everything away for a fantasy, fine? - Okay. I understand you, and youre wrong. Adam, love at first sight is film bullshit. Listen to me, nobody falls in love at first sight. We fell in love at first sight. Youre brothers. Listen, you should hear the truth, because you are extremely naaive. Shes a brain researcher. Shes beautiful. Youre not in the same league. That s why it will be over. Everything in life is divided by leagues. Now, you can go up a league, but only if you really improved. If you do this story, it can improve your status. If you dont, no matter how cute you are, youll stay in your league. Okay. Tonight youre going on another date, a different one, someone perfect for you. Yarden, leave me alone, Im telling you its real and you send me on another pretend date? Adam, stop, whats real? Come on, no, wait. Whats real? Wait, whats real? What? You kissed on the mouth? Come on, whats wrong with you? No, did you even talk since then? Listen, you tried, you really tried and its beautiful and I appreciate I swear, but it will not end well. Yarden, thanks, I get it. I know how I feel and I know she feels that way too. Im out. Cool, go breath some fresh air, think about it, tonight you have a date. Is this yours or Shmaya? - Funny. I dont get it. His ventral tegmental area is still inflamed. I dont need this explanation, I just dont understand why. Because hes in love. Like you. Im not in love. Maya, youre a researcher. Isnt it time for you to check your research personally? Maybe youll discover something new for science and all that. For science? - For science. Tt was really hard to get it. Its still cold in the center. Wow, thats all I ever wanted. Do you have a condom? Yeah. I have it for years. Wait, and then they slept? - Yeah. And then I joined. What? - No, not like that... I just came there and... And thats it, they werent together anymore. Want some dessert? Wait. You told me with lots of details all about what happened to this cute couple in the hospital, in the accident, and I dont know how you know all those details. Adam told me and I made some of them up to make it more interesting. Okay, and now, when youre finally a little shitty, you skip that part? Come on, thats why were here. Tell me, come on. What, you suddenly came to her apartment? Youre annoying. And you are like him. Hello. Are you Maya Shaked, who ran over Adam? Wow, youre really hot, he said the truth. What? Who are you? - Im Yarden Gat, I work with Adam. I need to talk to you. Look, this whole thing you have between you, Adam doesnt see it like it is. This person watched too much Notting Hill, it made him dumb. Adam is very busy with a very large project now, he has to get married soon and were really screwed because that naaive moron thinks he really have a chance, so if you could please end it nicely... No, no, no! Yarden... Yarden. - Adam? Yarden. Yarden, stop, please. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? How did you find us? The Einats. Wait, you... Whoa, and she... You sealed the deal? That's why you didnt go on the date yesterday. That's why you didnt answer when I called? What date? What wedding? Whats going on here, Adam? Maya, Im sorry, Yarden has a problem with boundaries and this story isnt happening. Im not going on anymore dates. Im focusing on you only. So Im part of a story? Youre writing about me? You see shes a researcher. - No, youre really not a part of it. So how many girls are you going out with? No one. - 13. I think you should both go. - Wait, Maya, I can explain. - No, just leave, I... just leave. My pants. Can I just pee? - Get out! How crazy. Wow. Good think it happened. It wouldnt have ended well. Look, even if you dont think so, Im watching over you, I just dont want you to get hurt and... even if youre a little hurt now, youll see that in the long run I was right. - Youre a monster. What? - Youre a monster. You, you ruined my only chance to have something that resembles real love. Adam, shes not... Shes out of my league, okay, I get it. You keep saying that, like were in India and we have castes and I cant be interested in someone whos a little pretty or smart or has any ambitions in life. - No. Right? Because thats what your twisted mind determined. That's not what I mean. - And all that for what? For what? For having Amos publish your book? Cant you do a crowdfunding project like everyone? No, thats pathetic. Adam. Adam, come on! Wait a minute! - I know thats what he promised you. Adam... - What happened to you? Amos and I... Its not about... - Stop, Yarden. Its a crowded office with glass walls, and everyone knows youve been sleeping with the boss. Me and you are done, so fuck you, Yarden, okay? Just fuck you. That's what you do best anyway. Adam, let me... I dont deserve this. I think youre right. So say, what league am I on? Are we on the same league? Stop it. No, really, some are equal, some are less equal and people cant be with other people because... why? Everyone must be with his own caste? Thats what I thought back then. If thats your direction, I can recommend a book. Its called Mein Kampf, maybe you heard about it. Its nice, it also has illustrations. Lovely, those are similar ideas. Okay, thats not what I think, thats what I told him then because... I tried to protect him and I thought its a win-win situation, so... But whats the win? What was important? The story? The book? Amos? By the way, is that still going on, Amos? - No, no. It doesnt, and lets stop. Maybe you tell me how shitty you are, because so far Im the only one talking and it was your idea. Okay, Im to blame, classic. No, really, you didnt even hear the end of the story or you dont want to hear it because you already understood... Excuse me, can I have the check? - Yeah. -Thanks. Okay, you dont have to... Ill play, okay? Look, I had a great time, but... I know its not going anywhere. I mean, 1 can estimate. After a"-lm a statistician. But Im glad someone from your status spend a night... With me, really. Way to go. So heres a humble gift from us, simple people. Okay? -Come on, do me a favor, what are you on about? You know you come from a great caste, dont be a hypocrite. I didnt come up with this idea. The whole world thinks that way, Hollywood thinks that way, they teach us its that way. They teach you to think that way, its not your fault, you were tracked into it. - No, thats not what I mean. It is my responsibility... - Im paying. Can you take it please? - So judgmental. -Take 15 percent. Declined. - Excuse me? Declined, it doesnt work. Got another card maybe? I dont have another one. Try again, its... That's impossible. Whats todays date? That's it. - Can I do it by phone? Now youre imprisoned here. Hes a simple person. What? - Never mind. I love simple people. You know what? Wait a few minutes. Thanks. For one moment I was almost the cool guy. Okay, now, that you have to stay here, I really want you to hear the end of the story. I know how it ends, Yarden. You told Amos, convinced him to do another story, you apologized to Adam, he forgave you because youre cute. You wouldnt have told this whole story if you didnt look cute at the end, right? You went on with your life and he stayed alone. The end. Okay, thats not exactly the end. Is that what happened to you? No. I mean, there was someone and she did lie and I did forgive her, there was a wedding and I did end up alone, but... its completely different. How did you forgive her? Because shes cute. What can you tell someone who isnt happy with you? Eventually I consoled her. At least the wedding was fun? Fun? A nightmare, really. Nice bachelor party? It was hell, I cried in the toilet. What was the worst thing. - In the wedding? Its hard to choose. Okay, there was the Chuppah and she really cried and everyone was really excited, of course. I slept alone in the hotel suite at night. In the morning, the room service came with breakfast, so I turned on the shower, pretended like shes in there. That's the saddest thing ever. I dont know, I thought it would work out. I was naaive. Sounds familiar? Maybe you wand to hear the end of the story anyway? So I understand theres no Adam. Theres no Adam and thats cool, because he wasnt good for that and... Hes not a hero of a story. You saw him, people wouldnt have connected to him. Its better to have something that arouses people, that turns them on, something they havent seen yet. Are you ready? -For what? Dubrovnk, pearl of the Alps. Its in the Balkans. Whats going on, Yarden? We cant give up on the story with Adam. But he doesnt want to. - So he doesnt convince him. I tried, hes stubborn as a mule. - Donkey. No, donkeys are stupid. Maybe its a raven, I dont know. Hes stubborn and hes not with us, and I can see why, we pretty much abused him. Im publishing it anyway. We have text, I have pictures. I even have pictures he doesnt know about. Make up some ending, III publish it. People paid they bought the whole issue. Amos, arent you listening? Im telling you, he doesnt want it. I dont care. He signed a contract. Never mind, you sold him out anyway. Its okay, we have it. Im going to the board to tell him. But there will be no wedding. He wont come to get married. Whatever, its good for me Dont worry, there will be an issue, your book will be printed, everythings great. You know what? Well make sure there was a wedding. - How? Photoshop. Well make him 30 pounds thinner. - That's insulting. Hell sue you if you do that. I want to see him sue me. Hes the one breaching the contract. If I want, his kidneys are mine. I can hand them on my rear-view mirror. Dont you mind lying? Good morning, Yarden, what happened? From the cafeteria to me you grew a conscience? Just dont go to the ninth floor, it will be really embarrassing. Okay, so I do mind. And Im telling you that If you do I dont want my name on it. Whats going on? And you do want it on Dubrovnik? No, I dont want anything. You just take a person, he didnt do anything wrong to anyone, and you turn him into a joke. Sorry, youre the one who turned him into a joke. No, the joke is this newspaper. This newspaper is a joke to you? The best-selling newspaper in the country, employing 1,600 people, is that a joke to you? I understand that in your age everything looks like bullshit and you only care about your art and your feelings and your musings, but nobody says this newspaper is a joke. You dont work here anymore. Good luck. So this is the end, right? Like, the end. - Okay. Here. I saw youre a little sad so I brought you a cookie. I made it, its not theirs. Thanks. - But its five shekels, okay? Its only for the ingredients, its all natural. Theres spelt and buckwheat and dates and linseed oil and coconut oil and grapeseed oil and chia oil, its all full of oils here, thats why its a little... I see what I tried not to understand for a very long time, that its not someone from the outside who decided not to print my book. My book is just not good enough. I wasnt good enough. I didnt write it good enough, I didnt put enough effort. I was wrong, but the nice thing about writing, Is that if you made a mistake, You can also delete it, and try to start something new. I love it when people leave me a message, so leave it, and if time will allow it, I'll call. Adam, that's bad... Hey. Amos, What... are you doing here? What I always do here. Why, not interested? Interested? Remember I broke up with you? Oh, really? Is that what it was? You fired me. _Come on, what's the newspaper got to do with this? Wow, you did some things that I would never... Can I go inside and end this conversation? You can't go inside, and you can't nothing with me Yarden, what... I thought you knew the difference between business and pleasure. Wow, you just don't have boundries. What, were you raised by lawyers? What's up? - All of a sudden you're a self-righteous person? Listen, all that morality that you suddenly have, It doesn't suit you, really. Come on, you're just like me. I'm nothing like you. Really? Why? Because you're writing a book? You think you're better than the newspaper because you're an artist now? Everyone, get out of the way, intellectual person coming through. Maybe you're just jealous of me? Jealous of you? Do you even understand what is going to happen to you? In the next 60 years, each one of your readers, it's not even half the readers of The obituary in the newspaper. Who cares? - You care. Because I know who you are, like I know who I am, And I don't need to do art, I don't think a lot about what is right, and neither do you, That's why we have fun together. Fun? What was fun? What do you think, I loved you? You started to write telenovelas now also, Yarden? Come on, you had fun in the newspaper, I had fun when the book went to print, And you had fun with me. Yes, you had fun. Doing all the wrong things. Cool, It's not who I want to be. Yarden, listen, In order to become the spirited woman that you desire to be, You don't need to write a book, no. It's enough to be a human being who doesn't sell his friends short for a story that he hates. And you, Yarden Gat, are hardly that person. So I'm going to be. Amos, Amos are you still there? I need you to open, the handle... Open it from your side... Okay, But it feels like I slammed the door at you, right? We're closing. - What? We're closing. But good for you, It's not easy. I was once in a, how do you say... Subordinate relationship. He was a shift supervision It ended when he joined the army. Anyway, you want to pay? Yes. - I didn't charge you for the cake. Thanks. - Come on, how did the story end? What happened with Adam? What happened with Maya? I didn't think you're really into that, and anyway, you already know the end to the story and I also talk too much. - Okay, I'm sorry, alright? Do find it interesting, Maybe I went a little far with the... Hitler? I didn't compare between you two, I just said there's a resemblance. Not physical, you don't have a mustache. Subtle, really. Come on, I'm sorry. Okay, but anyway, we have to go, so thanks. You can take a couple more minutes. Sweet. Okay. So I was really lost, and full of guilt, And I didn't really know what to do, And Adam was so helpless... Maya, I... Maya. It was... - A mistake, you're right. I understand how it looks, but if you could only give me... So I kept trying to delete the mistakes I made before. But I knew it wasn't enough. I knew that if I wanted Adam To forgive me, I need not only to delete it, But to fix what I did. Maya, come on, please open up. - No. Come on, Maya, please... Maya, is it possible that one of your rats is loose? What? No, all of my rats are here. Okay, can you please open up? There's a rat here. Deal with it. - No, it's a real rat. Not an academic rat that reads "Ha'aretz" newspaper first thing in the morning. She looks at me funny. Thanks. Great, I see that you made some changes here. No. Still nice. I was reading that. - What do you want? Alright. I... First of all, I came to apologize, And also to ask for something, and also apologize. For what? That you keep bursting into my life for the second time? Yes. Also I'm not really a telephone person, but in the past you could just show up at your friends' house, right? I mean, we're not friends, but we read the same book. We have something in common. I don't think so. What are you apologizing for? Well, I... I wanted to apologize for messing up everything between you and Adam. Really, it was so stupid, and I was just in some foolish competition with myself, over nothing, and just ruined it for everyone, But that's it, I want to start over. Really, Tabula Rasa. People say it, it's a salad. I want to be the person that I'm not. That I do want to be, and that I'm not right now, And the thing that can help me become that person, that I'm a little bit right now, butthat I really wasn't, Is that you stop being angry at Adam. Ow, I'm so glad I got it out. It was also a lot better than I'd imagined. In my mind it was going like, wow... He put you up to this? - No way. Adam doesn't talk to me. He's really mad at me, no. By the way, it's not Adam's fault, I'm the one to blame for everything. Adam dldnt do anything. So he didn't date 13 girls in the same week? That one specifically yes, but also, from the moment he met you, he left. I presented it like he left, he didn't really leave but he left, And what you had, it seemed to be very real, strange, but real, So please, just a call, an instant message, a caterpillar's emoji. - It's not the best time right now, I have a very important lecture at the university today. Oh really? That's interesting. What is it about? It's about the rats, right? I know. What... So what? No, I'm really interested, What is it about? I'm into people right now. Alright. We have managed to prove that the hormone responsible for secreting dopamine and arousal at the pleasure center of the brain during an interaction with an object, Can be activated within five seconds of the interaction. Wait... You just described falling in love with a lot of words? Is that what you're studying? No, really. - I can't belive it. You actually proved that a person can fall in love within' five seconds? - No, Yarden. No. I can't believe it, it's crazy. Adam was right. He was looking for love... - Yarden. -You proved love. Yarden... - It was really a stupid coincidence, That while he was making an article about it, he met you. That's the whole point in romance, right? A lot of unusual coincidences. A Heart is drawn to a heart, and Hormones are splashing... - Yarden, I'm really glad That you're having an enlightenment, but I have a really important lecture and I really have to attend, so I would love to talk to you about this some other time, but for now, bye, And next time, on the phone. Come with me to meet Adam. What to you care? What do you have to lose? Another boring night at home? - I can't, I have a lecture now. So after the lecture. It's not falling in love, it's a manipulation of the mind, I managed to neutralize it in 15 rats. You destroyed the rats' love life? Who are you? - Bye, Yarden Too bad, in the future it will be worth a lot of money. Okay, go upstairs. Dress up, we're going. What? I don't have time to explain. Just... - Yarden, I don't want you here, okay? Or at all. Just don't be right now. Adam... Adam, stop. Just a minute, stop... You've stepped on poop, I'm telling you, stop. I don't really care anymore. - Just hear me out for a second. I tried to protect you, but you don't need people who will protect you, Most of all, me, But I can help you if you'll let me, please, for the last time. Maya doesn't want to talk to me. I just have to face reality and move on. How come you got all rational, you suddenly remember? You were right, I was wrong. She has a lecture at the university today. What do you want me to do about it? Go to her lecture, and tell her in front of everybody how much I love her? I was thinking about going there after the lecture, but your idea is really good. Adam, Adam... Change your shoes. Shoes, good idea. Got a brownie? So what we did is just run like crazy to the lecture hall, hoping she hasn't started yet. Of course she already started, and they wouldn't let us in. I have to stop with those heels. Adam, what? - I have to get inside. No way. She spent seven years working on this, you're not going to mess it up for her. Wow, nice shoes. I have to go in, don't you get it? I have to see her. Watch it online. Keep an eye over here. The same hormones and pheromones, that can lift us up as high as possible, when love is there and available, can bring us down and crash us when it's gone. If I'll try to get inside, you're not going to hurt me, right? You took some kind of a security guard oath? There's no such thing as a "security guard oath". So I came up with the idea Say, why don't you let me in? Do you want me to call the university management? Because my mom is part of the directorate, she can fire you in a second. I'm a contractor. Wow, I'm so sorry, I'm right there with you in your struggle. Adam. - You have to unite. I have a call. - Adam, shut up already. Hi. Say, do you know where the film and media class is? Yeah, in the opposite building, second floor. What are you doing? - I'll explain on the way. I realized that if there's an online broadcast, you can hack the computer connected to it, and I already talked with the Einats about hacking the university's system. If I ask you to hack into Maya's computer, And to broadcast it to our live video, can you do it? Give us fifteen minutes. - You got ten minutes. Where are we going? - Don't bother your pretty head, let me." Okay, who's a cameraman here? Basically, we haven't been divided to courses yet. Got it. We need your gear. Impossible, we're in the middle of an exercise. Get out of the class. Who wants to direct? Still, we haven't been divided yet. Losers, Okay, You're the director, you're on camera, You handle the sound and lights. Adam, go sit over there. Aim a flashlight at him, I'll be right back. Come on, guys, this is the last time you'll ever do something meaningful with your degree. You're going to save a relationship here. We have a connection. Alright, we're ready. Adam, why are you dressed like this? We are connected to the lecture in ten, nine... Eight... Seven.. What about sound? _Okay, when we come back, have the camera to his heart, okay? camera to the heart. Why doesn't he have sound? - Let's go. As you can clearly see, In this video of our brain waves... No, no, zoom out. We're on the air. Now it was all up to Adam. What, like a moving speech? Yeah, but... in Adam's style. Hi Maya, and hi, crowd. Give yourself an applause or something. I know it's not exactly what you were going to show them, But let me introduce myself. Can somebody... - I'm the one rat that Maya couldn't fix. He's not a rat, You can clearly see he's not a rat. Can somebody stop this? Pull the plug or something. Maya... - That's exactly what I'm trying to I know what I'm suppose to say, that I'm sorry, that I'm so sorry, And yeah, maybe you're right, Maybe falling in love is just a manipulation of hormones on the mind, that can also drive us crazy, but how many people will go home tonight feeling that the best thing has happened to them? How many people will be dancing tonight on the streets... Less gay, less gay. So Maya, I know it's sounds crazy, but... I found my one and only, and all that remains is asking... No. Yes! All I can ask is... If you're ready to give me one last chance. And romantic light... And music. "Like a gypsy, travelling the world and..." Not that. - No. Interested? I really hope it's brownies. Oh, yeah, I didn't think it would... Kind of an unrealistic ending, no? Not at all, but what I understood from all of this, love is a little unrealistic, although you know, when it happens, it happens, you can't control it. Or it just happens, you know, any moment, for all kind of reasons. Even if you didn't think it could happen before. That's how I finished my book, by the way. Oh, how did you publish it? Crowdfunding. _Nice. I would read it, but I think I heard most of the stories. Well, I'm going that way. Yeah, me too. So it's a good thing we figured it out now, Otherwise we'd break up going the same direction. It's embarrassing. - Very embarrassing. Okay. So Adam and Maya are still together? Yeah, sure. Adam opened a little coffee shop and Maya couldn't go back to the university with the shame after Adam's actions... But she's on the developing team of Ada Yonat, working on... Some kind of boring stuff that will save humanity, or rats. So... I'm here. So... Next time we'll hear how much of a shitty person you are, Or there won't be a next time? Actually, I would tell you right now, but I'm starving. That restaurant was a mistake. - Mistake. You want to get some food? I think there's a nice toast place here. Do you eat toasts? Like, open all night, Heartburn 24/7. Let's do it, do they have homemade toast? - Of couse. Yeah, they also still try to melt a sausage, they don't understand it doesn't melt. Let's do it then, double sausage-toast. Actually, I think I'm done for today. Eating, I mean, But maybe coffee? Alright. Very strong coffee? How do you know? At this cafae that you always order, that's where I asked you out. It's not the first time I saw you there. I was there a lot of times. I was a little ashamed telling you that. Really?
