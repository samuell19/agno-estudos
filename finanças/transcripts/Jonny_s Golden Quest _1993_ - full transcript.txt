[beeping] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [door opens] [footsteps] [whirring] [beeping] [pounding on door] [gasps] Unh! You won't get away with this, Jonny. zap ["Jonny Quest Theme" music] zap zap zap [panting] [whirring] zap zap Ah! 'Game's over, Jonny.' No! Argh! [beeping] Bull's eye! Great shot, Race, but I'll bet you a cheeseburger and fries I get away next time. - 'Excellent time, Race.' - Thanks, Dr. Quest. Let's hook you up and check your vital signs. Your heart rate never went above 80. All in all not a bad workout. [barking] I get to be the bad guy next time, Dr. Quest. And I will not be caught so easily as Jonny. Sim sim sala bim! Whoa! Ha ha. It takes more than a few magic tricks to beat an I-One agent, Hadji. [beeping] Hi, mom! What's up? Jonny, tell your father 3-DAC is receiving a call from Intelligence One and it's coded Geronimo. We're on our way, Rachel. Geronimo, dad? Top priority, Jonny. From Washington. (male #1) 'As always, Dr. Quest, all Intelligence One missions' are of utmost concern to national security. Of course, Commander Peros. This particular case could be vital to our interests in the southern hemisphere. 'Race Bannon, your family's bodyguard has instructions' to remain armed at all times. You'll also need to be accompanied by a world-ranked biologist. It just so happens I know someone who'd be perfect for the job. (Commander) 'Your wife is a step ahead of you.' I've already agreed to go along, Benton. [kisses] Wow! Mom's finally going on a mission with us. [barking] I'm patching you through to I-One headquarters, Peru. Buenosdias, Dr. Quest. There are reports of strange mutations in a remote region of our rainforest. [beeping] (Race) 'What do you make of it, doctor?' - In my opinion.. - Looks like.. [chuckles] You first, doctor. I can't tell much from the pictures. But these genetic anomalies could drastically alter the entire ecosystem in that region. You mean, those plants and animals might become extinct, mom? Could be, Jonny. We'll BioCom sweep all living organisms within a select test grouping. Race, prepare Questor-I for takeoff. Rodger. Johnny, Hadji, I'll need your help. [barking] Yeah, you too, Bandit. Benton, if we can't reverse these growth patterns.. I know. They could destroy the primary food chain on a global scale. Intelligence One, Peru, has made arrangements for a civilian contact to escort you to the study site. 'Good luck, Team Quest.' 'And proceed with extreme caution.' [tires screeching] Well, uh, what do you think, Rachel? (Rachel) 'When you said we'd be roughing it, Benton' 'I thought you meant no room service after midnight.' This place looks completely deserted. [tires screeching] Not completely. Everybody down! Dad, you gotta do something. [chuckles] I think Race can handle this himself. [laughs] Oh, is it really you? No, I'm a hologram. Mwah. Of course, it's me. You know something, Bannon? In this light, you're almost as handsome as you always thought you were. Huh? Dr. Quest, Rachel, I'd like you to meet Jade Kenyon. Jade Kenyon Bannon. Um, yeah, my ex-wife. (both) Wife? Why, Race, you never said anything about ever being married. And he probably never told you he served time for armed robbery either. Armed robbery? [laughs] Jade. Okay. Only kidding about the jail thing but we were married for one brief week 12 years ago. (Race) Jade was a freelance operative working for I-One when we meet. (Jade) I remember we made some team, Bannon. We flushed out the biggest illegal weapons dealerin Europe. (Race)Remember how we ran off and got marriedthat same weekend? (Jade)How could I forget? It's not every girlwho gets to spend her honeymoon breaking out ofan Iraqi prison. (Race)That's kinda when we realizedour careers wouldn't qualify either of us for thehoney, I'm home award. So we agreed it'd be better to go our separate ways rather than tie each other down. And you just happened to be passing through the Peruvian rainforest today. Not exactly. I ran into some weird mutations a few weeks back and gave I-One a call. You're our civilian contact? Fastest 5000 bucks I ever made. [Race chuckles] Same old Jade. Always looking to.. [growling] (Jade) Besides, I hoped I-One would send you in. Okay, everybody, this place is a little off the beaten track. So hop up, strap in and hang on to your lunch. Come back down the mountain tonight and I'll buy you a drink at the best little cafe for miles around. From the looks of this place, Jade it's gotta be the only cafe for miles around. [both laughing] Bannon, a lot happens in 12 years and I.. ...I have something to tell you. Come on, Race. Dr. Quest needs you down at the river. I'll be right there, Hadji. What were you going to say, Jade? Um, I'll tell you tonight. Be careful. Since when is careful in your vocabulary? This is our best I-One case ever. Well, taking a trip to the jungle is more exciting than anything I ever did at 12. Oh, mom, I mean the other cases with dad they were exciting and all but we never just kinda hung out and talked about stuff. Like I do with you. Well, you should try it out with him, Jonny. - Dad's a great listener. - Yeah, uh.. Funny how Jade wanted to see Race again. You think they still love each other? Well, they say you never get over your first love. It'll happen to you someday. All that handholding, smoochy stuff? No way! Well, it all depends on the girl. But I bet you like all that smoochy stuff. I'd rather hold these crocodile eggs any day. [dolphins clicking] [clicking intensifies] Why are they acting so strangely, mom? I don't know. Maybe there is a glitch in my voice chip. Come on. Let's see if they'll give us a ride back to camp. [dramatic music] (Race) 'After this mission, I might put in for a vacation, Dr. Quest.' First thing's first, Race. Adjust your back focus. What in the name of.. Race, get out of there! Fast! Two heads aren't always better than one. [growling] Hurry! Get the winch, Hadji. - Take it away. - Going up. [growling] Whoa! Mom, look. Clam down, big fella. No one's gonna hurt you. Until we have a chance to study these samples everyone stays out of the river. But, dad, I know how to take care of myself. No rebuttals, Jonny. We've got too much work to do. Okay, Race, release him. [Race grunting] Hey, come on, pal, a bright guy like you can find a million exciting things to do in a jungle. Like what? Well, like tracking those iguana footprints along the shore there or taking a hike up Volcan Misti. Or challenging Race to a 100-yard dash back up to camp. Losers make the burgers and fries. (both) Alright. - You got it, Race. - You're on. On your mark, get set, go! [barking] And as for you, Mr. We-got-too-much-work-to-do this research is our job. Jonny and Hadji should have a little fun. I didn't mean he couldn't have fun, Rachel. It's just whenever I talk to him, it sounds like-- You're giving instructions to one of your lab assistants? And yet you always know exactly what I mean. Hmm. Jonny would call it smoochy stuff. We can communicate without words getting in the way. Yes. If only I could do the same with Jonny. As he grows up, he seems to be slipping away from me. [gasps] [screaming] (Benton) 'Race, help!' [Rachel screaming] That's mom. What in the world are those things? [imitating dolphins clicking] Come on, they're heading inland. - Here, Race. - Good thinking, Jonny. We can follow them anywhere with a tracking bug. Great shot, Race. We'll stick to them like fleas on a stray dog. Right, Bandit? [barking] [heavy breathing] Pity how all good things must end, Dr. Quest. After years of near-fatal captures at your hands we finally meet face to face. Why am I not surprised that it's you, Dr. Zin behind that genetic cesspool down in the valley? And why do you always insist on meddling in my affairs? Do I go where you work and bother you, Quest? [coughing] [inhales deeply] No matter at least now I get to meet the missus. Look. (Rachel) 'Benton.' (Zin) 'Do my children frighten you, my dear?' 'Quest, you will be the first' 'to witness my crowning achievement' to create life itself. [laughs] They are my crudest beginnings. [gibbering] Get up, you cretin. (Benton) 'Rachel, look, he's disintegrating.' I created you. Do as I say. Guess you can't even make people who'll work for you, eh, Zin? About to die and still that rapier wit. After you're gone, where, oh, where shall I find another rival so close to my own class? Look under any rock. [laughs] (Rachel) 'Leave him alone, you monster.' [laughs] [coughing] [inhales deeply] These Replicants are my earliest experiments. Let me show you something in a later model. Snipe! My team has solved the genetic decomposing problem altogether. And now I'm ready to use the secret on recreation of...myself. [laughs] [intense music] Behold! A perfect duplicate. And I defy you to tear us apart. [laughing] [both laughing] zap zap zap [screaming] (Benton) 'It's Race!' (both) Unh! - Ready, Hadji? - Ready. Geronimo! zap zap zap (Hadji) 'Sim sim sala bim!' [grunting] My hero. [gasps] Mom! (Benton) Good work, Jonny. - Are you alright, Rachel? - Yes, Benton. Dr. Quest...catch. The door! Hadji! Sim sim sala bim! zap zap zap Aah! [glass shattering] [grunting] We have to neutralize Zin's army of mutants. Stop! You're destroying my children. Cowards! Where are you going? zap zap [growling] boom This place is gonna blow. Come on, we gotta get out. (Zin) Happy to oblige, Quest team. Benton! - Rachel! - Mom! 'Mom!' zap zap zap Look out, Jonny! Get down! Get the cable climber ready, Jonny. You got it, Race. zap zap zap zap zap zap boom [Replicants screaming] [barking] (Race) 'Jonny, you and Hadji take the truck.' Gotta get to mom. Jonny! We're gaing on them, Jonny. You, Quests! Such a persistent breed. Look out, Jonny. Say goodbye to the boys, Mrs. Quest. No! Zin, don't! Incoming! boom [Zin laughing] That should take care of those brats. Jonny! [barking] Unh! [barking] Dad! Help us! 'Shoot, dad.' Shoot! Go ahead, Quest. Laser burns leave such unsightly scars. (Jonny) 'Dad, what are you waiting for?' [Zin laughing] You gotta shoot now. I can't. (Rachel) 'Benton!' (Zin) I always knew you were a coward, Quest. [laughs] [beeping] boom Your husband will pay for what he's done with your life. Mom! 'He's got mom.' 'He's trying to get away. Dad, do something.' boom Rachel, no! Mom! He killed mom. Jonny, I-- - Why didn't you shoot? - I couldn't, son. - I would've hit your mother. - You let mom die! You let her die. [sobbing] [barking] - Here, Jonny. - Thanks. You cannot throw away your anger with those stones, Jonny. - Talk to me. - Oh, what's the use? It's not gonna bring mom back. Talk is just talk. Actions speak louder than words. [barking] (Benton)'That's the lastof Zin's mutant cells.' 'Like his clones' all the mutated samples have self-destructed. The last satellite sweep of the region indicated no further contaminants. It's my hypothesis that Zin never found the secret to successful cloning. And if he did, the secret died with him. Case 2785X.. ...closed. (3-DAC) 'Dr. Quest.' 'I'm receiving an urgent call from the White House.' Accept the transmission, 3-DAC. Very well, Dr. Quest. zap Good evening, Mr. President. Benton, what is this malarkey about you quitting I-One? Retiring, sir. I'm taking a professorship at Cambridge. But you're our top operative. If you need more bodyguards, better equipment, name it. I appreciate your confidence in me, sir but after losing Rachel, I just can't subject my family to the dangers of this line of work any longer. I have a family myself, Benton. We'll always hold a place for you on the I-One team. Thank you, but it's not necessary, sir. Good luck. 3-DAC, begin permanent shutdown of the compound. [barking] Dr. Quest, for the last six years I've put up with all manner of harassment from this creature. [growls] zap [whimpers] Bandit, down, boy. [barks] Dr. Quest, I wish to know if you will be taking me with you, sir? Of course, 3-DAC. Now, begin the shutdown. I'm going to check on Jonny. There must be something we can do to make him change his mind, Race. [sighs] Let me know if you think of anything, Hadji. You okay? I was just lookin' at mom's dolphins. Yes, well, I'm afraid, son that given our time frame, we've got to let them go. Would you take the other end? Perhaps if we did this together-- No! Jonny, I know this is hard but your mother would've wanted them to be set free. How do you know what she'd want? Maybe she'd want us to stay here and not run away. - I'm not running. - Giving up then. This place, I want everything. Jonny, please. I don't wanna talk about this, okay? 'Son, if you close off all communication' things will only go on deteriorating between us. I care about you. Race and Hadji care about you. - We're your family, but if-- - Yeah, you're my family. The only difference is Hadji tried to help mom escape. And Race would've made that shot but you didn't do anything. Ah, they're at it again. Hey, Jonny, want to go into town? Yeah, let's get out of here. Dr. Quest. I had no way of knowing she was going to die, Race. But still, could I have made that shot? No one could've made it, Benton. Stop blaming yourself. Jonny's doing enough of that for both of you. 'He's gonna have to face his demons by himself.' Jonny, slow down. Whoa! Help. Hadji! 'Get away from me.' [barks] [snarling] Relax, Jonny. What's going on, Hadji? El dia de los muertos. The day of the dead is an old Mexican celebration. [instrumental music] [crowd cheering] Mom would've loved this. Remember when she took us to Mardi Gras? [Bandit growling] [chuckles] And Bandit thought all the floats were giant puppy chew toys. [Bandit growling] [both laugh] This is the first time I've ever seen bones bury a dog. [growls] [both laugh] [crowd cheering] [barks] Bandit, already knows which mask he wants. You're hurting me. Give me that. It's mine. Hey, let her go. Sim sim sala bim! [men yelling] Are you alright? Sim sim sala bim! Did he just do what I think he did? Stick around. He's full of tricks. [all scream] [all yelling] This vehicle has four gears and all of them slow. Do that magic trick again and get them away from us. Sorry, this truck is too heavy. I can lift little more than my own body weight. [Bandit barking] (Jonny) 'Bandit, get out of that powdered sugar.' Achoo! Look, Hadji. Maybe Bandit's got an idea for losing those guys. [whimpering] [coughing] [laughs] That should teach you. Too much sugar always wipes you out. How can I ever thank you? I'm, uh, you're, uh, I mean.. He with the tongue of a thousand knots is Jonny Quest. I am.. [whistling] Sorry, Jonny, gotta go. No, wait! Your mask. Hey, easy! We're not the bad guys. [speaking in Spanish] You gotta believe me. They had knives and were chasing some girl. Jonny, look. [speaking in Spanish] He says it is made of gold. A golden mask? The police think the mask is part of a major smuggling operation. And they are searching for Jonny's mystery girlfriend. It's a good thing you called I-One Headquarters, Dr. Quest. Thank you for expediting the boys' release, Agent Mendez. De nada. Perhaps in return you could look into this gold smuggling case for us? Sorry, I am retired. But, dad, that girl is in big trouble. And so are you, young man. Do you see what can happen when you run off all hotheaded? I was just trying to help someone, but I guess since you've quit I-One, you don't believe in that anymore. Race, would you finish up here? Uh, Jonny. I'm no psychologist, Hadji but I bet taking this assignment would do both of them some good. Hmm. Let's see what we can do, eh, Dr. Bannon. (Race) 'Nope, Hadji, based on some of the artifacts we found' on other I-One missions, I'd have to say it's definitely Ming Dynasty. Not so, Race. I'd say Japanese origin. My week's salary against your allowance 'that those are Chinese engravings.' Well, you better get your eyes checked, Race, after you pay me. You're both wrong. It's not from any dynasty and.. Oh. And I'm not taking this case. - No. - Of course, not. This is just professional curiosity. [beeping] 3-DAC, run a molecular infrastructure scan on this mask. [beeping] [dramatic music] beep Hmm. Definitely not an antique. 'These grooves etched into the mask are still sharp.' They should be rounded with age. But it looks ancient. That's an old counterfeiters' trick, Hadji. Simple shoe polish. Spectra analysis complete. The mask is composed of 100% pure gold. That's a scientific impossibility. - Gold bullion at best is only-- - 99.87% pure. [Benton gasps] They've done it. Someone has made synthetic gold. [man speaking indistinctly on TV] What's going on? Some TV signal must be jamming our security system. (man on TV) 'Tell the one you love how much you care. Buy her two.' [gasps] Jonny, your dad wants you inside right away. Alright. [beeping] [beeping] [beeping] Look, the security perimeter is shorting out. Must be a glitch in the hanger alarm. Let me go kick a few circuits. creak [dramatic music] zap zap zap (Jonny) 'Dad, Race is trapped in the vacuum chamber.' He'll suffocate. Air being sucked out. I can't.. The lock's melted shut. And the vacuum cannot be shut off. Dad, what are you doing? That'll take too long. The oxygen is almost gone. [growling] [Bandit growling] (Jonny) 'He's going to fly the protype.' (Benton) 'Don't do it, Race.' Go, Race! Aah! Alright. [groans] - Are you okay, Race? - Yeah. I think so. Well, that was great. You took a chance and it came through. (all) Huh? (Hadji) 'It looks like someone redecorated.' Ah, it must have been the guy who jumped me. The mask! Where is the gold mask? And where is Bandit? [Bandit barking] Who needs a security system when we've got you, boy. slurp slurp [laughs] - Hmm. - Dr. Quest, look. That is one of Zin's replicants. He must have survived that volcano blast. If he did, then maybe Zin is still alive. And mom. I'm not receiving you. Have you made it into the Quest compound? Come in, damn it. Zin! Is my mother there? Is she still alive? You. The last time I saw your mother, she was destroyed with my most perfect clone. 'I told you you couldn't tell the difference between us' 'but I will begin again. I..' Secret for processing synthetic gold. If Zin's after this mask he's probably involved with whoever is making the gold. And if we track them down, we're bound to run into Zin again. Makes sense to me. - Dr. Quest? - We are going after him, right? Uh, it's a job for one of the other agencies. Dad, you can't walk away from that murder. I'm not walking away from anything, Jonny. - I have to protect this family. - That's Race's job. He can do it better than anybody. We gotta go after Zin tonight before his trail gets cold. Dr. Quest, I have someone here with a story I think you want to hear. That's her. The girl from the village. My father went into hiding when he started making gold. - Where is he, Jessie? - I don't know. I got a message to deliver that mask to a friend of his. And this friend was going to get the gold process patented so your father could come out of hiding, is that right? Yes, so we could be a family again. What do you mean? I've lived in boarding schools most of my life so I never got to know my father. But if I can just deliver that mask to.. To whom, Jessie? You can tell us. No. Jessie, a maniac named Dr. Zin is after your father and his secret. I'll tell you, but only if I can come along. This is no time for bargains. If your father was in trouble wouldn't you wanna help save him? Uh, yeah, sure. That gold process could throw the entire world into a panic. I-One has to find that Devlon before Zin does. I'll take responsibility for Jessie. You mean Team Quest is back in business? Yes, but only for standard surveillance. No unnecessary risks. Welcome back, Dr. Quest. Let's call headquarters. Zin, you're dead meat. (Jessie) 'My father's message said to deliver the mask' 'to a man named Chikara.' Okay, Jessie, point the way. He lives in Tokyo. He'll know where my father is. With Quest searching for Devlon and his gold formula the game is now more interesting than ever. (Jade) 'Your Replicant almost blew it last night, Zin.' What? Can't a genetic mutant make a mistake.. '...Jade?' I've done my part, I'm not gonna see this deal fall through. Rest assured there will be no more slip-ups. [screeching] Hey, Race. How do you know if someone, like, say a girl or someone likes you? But like more than a friend. Someone like a girl, but not a girl? Uh, what planet do these creatures come from? Okay, a girl. 'Like Jessie?' Oh, that's a good example, but I'm not saying it's her. Oh, of course, not. But how would I know if she likes me? Well, whenever she came around, your charming good looks would make her hair stand on end. [laughs] You two about ready back there? We're coming. Have you ever been anywhere like Tokyo? No, I went to the Ice Capades once. The address my father sent me is on this street. It should be around here somewhere. There. That's where we'll find Chikara. What apartment number? [groans] I think we found him. Stay down. crash [grunting] That must be him. Jonny, your father said to stay here. Yeah, well, Race would go after them first and ask questions later. [screams] Only one way to catch them now. (Dr. Quest) 'No. No, Jonny.' I'll go after him, Dr. Quest. zap (Jessie) 'Jonny, what are you doin'?' Just gonna get the drop on 'em. Whoa! Jonny! Let go of me. Let go of me, lizard lips. Flyin' dragon, Jonny. Unh! Chikara, you're comin' with us. - Race! - Jonny, get back. [groans] Say hello...hero. Jade? Yes. Now, say goodbye. [Zin groans] Jonny, that was the bravest thing I ever saw. That was the most foolhardy thing I ever saw. - Are you alright, son? - Yeah, sure. Race, do we make a great team or what? Not too bad if I say so myself. With Chikara dead and Jade working for Zin what's our next move? - Jade? - Yeah. She wanted to tell me something back in Peru. Maybe she was going to warn you about Zin. The only way we'll ever know is if we can pick up the trail. - No, Jonny, it's too dangerous. - Dad, I can handle myself. Your father is right, Jonny. I can move faster without you. We've lost our only lead to finding Devlon. And I need your help scanning 3-DAC for a new tact on this case. Jonny, the hotel's back this way. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Jonny is so angry with you all the time. I think maybe he's going to blow up like a volcano. I'm doing what I can, Hadji but he's got to want to work it out. Um, I'll meet you guys back at the hotel, okay? Hey, Jonny, get out of the way. Jessie, wait up. You handle yourself pretty well for a girl. And you're pretty rude for a boy. I'm not rude. Alright, look, I'm sorry about that girl thing. No. I meant rude the way you ignore your dad. What did he do to make you so mad at him? I'm not in the mood for 20 questions, okay? I know one thing for sure. When I find my dad, I won't treat him like you do yours. Yeah? Well, don't be disappointed if you find out he isn't everything you thought he was. Uh-uh-uh. There you go being rude again. Hey, no fair. [laughing] Whoa! [laughing] - Real cute. - You're pretty cute yourself. Especially when you're surprised. Hey! Boo! [gasps] [laughing] [Jessie and Jonny laughing] - Hey, Jonny. - No, Hadji. Let's leave them alone. Jessie could be just what Jonny needs right now. Ah-ha! Tranquility often appears when least expected. That's very wise. Did your mystic teacher give you that advice? No, this fortune cookie gave it to me. chomp chomp [both laughing] [laughing] (Dr. Quest) 'There's something very odd about this case, 3-DAC.' 'Something I can't quite put my finger on.' 'Jessie wants us to find' where her father is processing his gold and yet she doesn't seem to know much about him. 'Scan this picture and see what you can come up with.' [beeping] [growling] Standard photographic paper. No useable prints or trace elements. Any record of Dr. Devlon in any of the world-wide metallurgical associations? [whimpering] - Negative. - Alright. Let's start with what we know. Give me all word clusters associated with the word gold. [beeping] [growling] zap [howling] Bandit! That'll teach you to bite my.. Bite my.. 'Bite my..' 3-DAC, return to cluster scan. [beeping] [Bandit whimpering] Only if that mongrel is relegated to separate quarters. Sorry, Bandit, you brought this on yourself. I hope someone rembered to pack aspirin. - Are you alright, Race? - Oh, I'm fine. I caught up with Jade and Zin, but lost them when three Replicants mistook me for a punching bag. Don't worry, I'll take care of you, Race. I'll go get some ice. It's just a silly little cut. You know boys and battle scars. I don't think I do anymore, Race. Lately, he treats you more like a father than he does me. Don't be silly, Benton. I'm no match for you. Give him time. That seems to be all I've got to give him these days anyway. Dr. Quest, D-Dr. Quest, I have something imp-imp-imp.. Funny. That's just how I feel, 3-DAC. Bandit took a bite out of its tail. (3-DAC) 'Word clusters associated with gold. Alchemy.' Alchemy. That's turning metal into gold, right? So say the legends. (3-DAC) 'Cross match, Leonardo da Vinci.' [chuckles] Bandit's bite really has 3-DAC on the fritz. It just went from fairy tales to famous artists. It might be onto something, Race. Aside from being a gifted artist it's believed da Vinci also dabbled in alchemy. (3-DAC) 'Checking world-renowned experts in da Vinci.' 'Anhausen, Blackwell, Chang, Devlon.' 'Dr. Vincent Devlon, Ph.D. Universita De Roma.' (Dr. Quest) 'Bull's eye, 3-DAC.' Dr. Devlon was an art history major, computer expert and he minored in metallurgy. Da Vinci. Da Vinci.. Didn't I-One investigate a heist of famous da Vinci papers about a year ago? (3-DAC) Affirmative-tive-tive. Stolen fromMusee d'Art de Paris. Case open, no suspects Not until now. [heavy breathing] Without a single clue to go on, Dr. Quest still moves forward. He's almost a worthy opponent. Find out exactly what they know. And if Race Bannon gets in the way, kill him. [inhales deeply] - Slowly. - No! No one will stand between me and the gold process. Take her away, Snipe. [grunting] So, Quest...the game continues. [instrumental music] - How does my hair look, Hadji? - The same as it always does. What's all the fuss, Jonny? We're just gonna meet your dad at the museum. Yeah, I know. Say, Hadji, uh...what do you think of Jessie? Hey, Race, Jonny wants to know what I think of Jessie. Oh, Hadji! I don't want to know, Race. Hey, Jonny. Got a trick for ya. If you wanna impress a girl, take her to a horror movie. Why a horror movie? When the ghost appears she'll get scared and snuggle up close. Trust me, works every time. Thanks for the tip. But who's talking about girls. Uh, can I try some of your cologne? [Hadji and Race laughing] What? What did I say? [Hadji and Race laughing] [instrumental music] [humming] Think Jonny's ever gonna ask me out, Bandit? [barking] I just hope he doesn't try that dumb old trick of taking me to a horror movie. [growling] What's the matter, boy? [intense music] [growling] [gasps] Shut the balcony door, Hadji. I'm going upstairs to get Jess. [intense music] Ah! rip Help, Race! [grunting] [grunting continues] [growling] [dramatic music] Put me down! Ah! [grunts] [ululating] Huh? [shattering] [growling] Sim sim salabim. [Indian classical music] Okay, no one move. Too late, Race. We have the problem all wrapped up. - Nice Tarzan move, Jessie. - Thanks. In my boarding school that was the only way to get out and have fun. Another one of Zin's army. So tell me, you slimy knothole geek, where's your boss? [groaning] Don't jerk me around. [screeching] Stay back, kids. [bubbling] Looks like a reject from the slime factory. (Race) 'Looks to me like Zin hasn't found the secret' 'for keeping his clones from degenerating yet.' Come on, let's get to the museum. 'Gotta rember to leave room service a big tip tomorrow.' (male #2) 'Pardon,monsieur, but I do not rember anything' from the night the da Vinci papers were stolen. This synapse-imager will unlock those memories. Now, just relax. [beeping] Let your mind drift back to the night of the robbery. [beeping] [zapping] Oh! Look, Jessie, it's your dad. (Jessie) 'Uh, yeah.' [growling] [barking] [alarm blaring] thud thud [all laughing] [alarm blaring] He's just a memory image, Bandit. Arreter! (Benton) 'Hit the freeze frame.' - It's Devlon alright. - Looks like a tranqua-dart. It induced a coma-like state so the guard saw everything and remembered nothing. Fast forward to where he steals the papers. [whirring] Da Vinci often wrote in codes spelling words backwards and.. - Uh, curious. - What is it, dad? It appears da Vinci encoded some kinda formula into this drawing. (Benton) 'If my Italian's right, this is a formula for making gold.' But he-he would have needed an incredible power source as strong as the sun. Well, if da Vinci couldn't make gold what good was this formula to Devlon? Hey, if someone got their hands on nuclear energy couldn't that supply the kinda power da Vinci only dreamed about. Good thinking, Jonny. Let's check 3-DAC for any thefts of uranium-235. [beeping] Devlon's trail is warming up. [zapping] [instrumental music] Don't worry. I won't let you fall. Mom, catch me, catch me. [both laughing] Jonny? Jonny? Jess, I was, um...just doing a system's check. - Your mother was beautiful. - Yeah, she was. Do you wanna see a memory of your dad? No, I-I can't. I mean, um...I'd rather just keep him in my head the way I remember him. Is that Peru, where she died? - Who told you that? - Uh...I don't know. - Your father, I guess. - Yeah. Did he also tell you that she'd still be alive if it wasn't for him? boom And when the time comes I'm gonna finish the job he couldn't. (Jessie) 'Jonny.' [door slams shut] [instrumental music] [zapping] Mama, I miss you. [swooshing] 3-DAC's been acting a little strange since Bandit took a bite out of it's power pack. [whimpering] I hope it holds together. (3-DAC) There have been six, six, six uranium thefts around the world. in the last two years. Four were re-re-recovered. One was stolen by a known terrorist group still at large. - And the sixth? - No leads. It was taken from a university lab in Rome, Italy. Wait a minute. Devlon graduated fromUniversita di Roma. Affirmative. Dr. Devlon, 1968. Devlon must've stolen the uranium to smelt his synthetic gold. I'll have Race set a course for Rome. Hi-yah! [groans] [grunting] Easy, Jonny, it's just a workout. But I gotta learn your flying dragon kick. It takes months, even years to prepare. I don't have that long. Hey, Race, since I've been working on my marksmanship when do you think I can start carrying a weapon like you? You know, there are better things out there than being a crack shot or a third degree black belt. Maybe. But those things can get the job done. No, Jonny. Those things allow other people to get their jobs done. I'm your father's protection. But he's the person I-One counts on. Maybe you should spend some time talking to him about what he does. He's a pretty incredible guy if you give him half a chance. Yeah, sure. Ahem, Race, would you go reset the automatic pilot for Rome? Devlon's trail just got red-hot. Right away, Dr. Quest. Jonny, we need to talk. You know, there are times when it's difficult for a father to find the right words. Um, dad...can we do this another time? Race might need help with the autopilot. You always knew what I was trying to say, Rachael. 'Why can't it be as easy with Jonny?' [engine revving] Si, the theft was three months ago. Do you know a graduate student who received his PhD here in 1968? A Dr. Devlon? Devlon? Devlon? Oh, yes. Brilliant man. Never showered. In fact, I've seen him around the campus 'doing research for a book I believe.' Always comes in at night. - So, he's still in the area? - I don't know. You could come back later and ask the night librarian. [revving] [intense music] It fits. Devlon here doing research, the uranium missing.. [sizzling] Look out, Jonny! [sizzling] [dramatic music] Jonny, why are they attacking us? Sim sim salabim! [Indian classical music] boom Get to the van, everybody. I'll cover you. [gunshots] [theme music] [tires screeching] [gunshots] (Race) 'Looks like Zin is branching out and hiring the local muscle' 'instead of using his replicants.' 'Hang on, I'm gonna try and lose them in St. Peter's Square.' [music continues] [tires screeching] thud Race, when I said I wanted to sightsee around Rome this isn't exactly what I meant. [gunshots] [all screaming] [tires screeching] Oh, I always heard how romantic you Italians are. He he. [gunshots] thump thump thump [screaming] [music continues] [splashing] Well, what do you know? Three cons in a fountain. (Race) 'Let's get 'em to I-One headquarters for questioning.' (Race) 'Here's a new one, Dr. Quest.' 'The goons are real city employees.' And get this, they don't work for Zin but for Devlon. Then he is in the area. - Do they know where? - No. They were paid to keep quiet about power fluctuations around the city. And he always contacted them. - Power fluctuations? - Hmm. A series of brownouts. My guess is Devlon is tapping into the city's electrical power to fire his nuclear smelting process. Jess, go find Jonny and tell him we've got great news. zap zap zap The way you're shooting, Elvis will have a hit before you do. zap zap zap Jonny, your dad says my father's in the area. That means Zin can't be far behind. Come on, Jonny. Yeah, um, I'll be right there. 'I'll see your ugly face again real soon.' [zapping] This time the job will be finished right. You'll pay for my mother's death, Zin. [instrumental music] slurp slurp [barking] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [barking] We can monitor the power stations for the source of the next brownout. That might take too long and Zin could get to Devlon ahead of us. Hey, Hadji, remember that project I did for the science fair last year? Yes. I bet we can find Devlon using the same basic idea. Come on. [instrumental music] (Benton) 'You know, Race, I'm glad Jessie came along on this mission.' 'I think she's helped Jonny in a way I haven't been able to.' [whirring] [music continues] When this over, Dr. Quest, you've really gotta find a way to get through to him. Hmm, wish I knew how. [rumbling] Heh. This has become a real fly by the seat of our pants reconnaissance mission. The idea's pretty simple. These batteries will put out a small force field. And when they pass through Devlon's force field it will create an electromagnetic induction. I think I missed the simple part. This compass will seek out the more powerful of the two electromagnetic fields. Leading us right to Devlon, uh, I mean my father. Well, since you kids know what we're doing let's split up and get to it. - I'll go with you, Race. - Uh-uh. Sorry, Jonny. I'm already on Race's bike. Why don't you go with your dad? (Benton) Plenty of room here, son. Jonny, hop on, and let's get this thing cranking. Yeah. Well, it looks like it's you and me, Bandit. woof [engine starts] [intense music] [engine revving] How long do you suppose this will take? - Could be all night. - Sounds good to me. [compass beeping] (Jessie) We must be getting close. I'm getting a strong reading in the Piazza Di Roma We're on our way, Jonny. The compass is pointing over there. click - Huh? - What's happening? click [rattling] clank clank clank The scooter is magnetized. Looks like Jessie is not the only one attracted to Jonny's magnetic personality. [all laughing] [clattering] Everything indicates we're dead in the center of Devlon's electro-magnetic field. I don't get it. There's nothing here. meow [growling] woof woof woof [cat yowling] [cat shrieking] woof woof woof Bandit won't take a chance chasing that cat underground. Wait a minute. In school, we studied about how the Romans built one of the world's first sewer systems. (Benton) Right, Jonny. There is a series of underground aqueducts and catacombs right beneath us. (Race) 'The perfect place for Devlon to process his gold.' This place gives me the creeps. Hey, Jonny, this reminds me of a horror movie I once saw. Right, Race. And remember those ghosts we stood up in Tower of London? You don't mean real ghosts, do you, Jonny? Stay close to me, Jess. I'm not afraid of any.. (both) Ghost! Haven't you two heard of will-o'-the wisp? In India, we call ituzal aloo. When swamp gas glows during an electrical storm. And the pocket of methane gas must be lit by the charged air particles from those bare wires. 'So, if-if we follow those cables--' They'll lead us right to Devlon's hideout. - Gold. - 'Yes.' More gold than agenie could conjure up in a 1001 nights. [sizzling] - Dr. Devlon, I presume? - What? Get away from me. [gunshot] I know, he sent you. We won't harm you. You're here to steal my secret. Jessie, tell your father who we are. Uh, Hadji, I.. Dr. Devlon, we brought your daughter. Daughter? I've never seen this girl in my life. Working with unshielded uranium has affected your mind, Devlon. We can help you. [rumbling] [groaning] Ah! zap (replicant #1) Leave and you die, human. Uh! - No, Jessie! - Mother. Jessie, thank goodness, you're safe. - Huh? - "Mother?" I love it when a plan comes together. And you all did what I wanted so well. Ha ha ha. Race-- Nothing you can say will make up for what you've done, Jade. - I'm not working for Zin. - Silence! [wheezing] (Race) 'Ever think of joining a health club, Zin?' [hissing] Dr. Zin, please, here's your gold formula. I'll come back and work for you. Please show mercy. Mmm...well, Devlon, perhaps I should give you a second chance. [snaps fingers] zap [sizzling] But then again, I've never been known for making good management decisions. You're a madman, Zin. People get what they deserve, Dr. Quest. Devlon discovered da Vinci's formula for synthetic gold for me, but he got greedy. And it was because of your interference in Peru that he was able to steal it. [wheezing] So, it was only fitting I tricked you into finding him for me again. You mean the gold mask was a plan so we take this case and lead you to Devlon? Jessie, you're part of this? Jonny, listen, please. Zin kidnapped my mother. I had to pretend Devlon was my father or he'd kill her. By simply following this tracking device you did my work for me. It's all been for nothing, Zin. When your synthetic gold hits the streets every government agency from Washington to Tokyo is going to come after you. Oh, you think too small, Quest. This isn't about money. It's about life, eternal. Injections of 100% pure gold are the key to ending the degenerative process in my clones. With this, I will be able to clone myself forever. [wheezing] Oh, that's some masterplan, Zin. Living for all eternity as a wheezing, dried-up, old fig. Good point, Mr. Bannon. But to be immortal as a physical specimen such as you.. Now that would be worth living for. (Jonny) 'Race!' [Zin laughing] Zin, when I get out of here.. [grunting] I will integrate your perfect genetic structure into my clones. And to the rest of you, as they say in Rome arrivederci. You know the drill. Get going! [whimpering] A thousand pardons, but I have a last request. Please gaze upon this stone. What's so special about.. (Hadji) 'Deeply, gaze deeply and do as I command.' You must let these people go. Let these people go. [laughing] But this one I will finish off with my bare hand. No more tricks, boy! Sim sim salabim! [screaming] Come on, everyone out! Sim sim salabim! That was quick-thinking, Hadji. Jess, let me see your watch. If I can reverse the signal we can home in on Zin. Some friend of Race's you turned out to be. Jonny, I know what you're thinking. That I lured you and your family to the Amazon from the very beginning. Sure, you wanted to tell Race that you were working for Zin. No. I found those mutations and called I-One like I told you. I was hoping Bannon would be sent in because I.. It was time I told him that he had a daughter. Race, my father? Jessie, when we split up, I didn't even know I was pregnant. But you always said my father was dead. I had to make a choice. Maybe it was a bad one but I decided it'd be better for you to have no father than to take the chance Bannon might not accept having a child. I can't believe this. You didn't even give me a chance to know him. He wasn't dead. But if Zin kills him it's your fault! (Jade) 'Jessie.' Jessie, wait up! What have I done? Don't worry, Jade. We'll save Race. Everybody deserve a second chance. Everybody. (Benton) 'The homing device indicates' 'the desalinization plant dead ahead.' That's where Zin must be hiding. I'll radio I-One for back up. Dad, we can't wait that long. Jonny, that place might be infested with replicants. If we go in we could get killed. And if we don't go in, my dad could get killed. You stay put then. I'm not afraid to stand up to Zin. vroom Jonny! No, it's too dangerous! [screaming] - Let go! - Let go! Get Bandit. [clicking] Let me go, scale-face. (Benton) 'They've got Jessie.' They must have Jonny inside the plant. We can surprise them if we go in through the salt chute. [gasping] (Zin) 'With your genetic structure added to my clones' they will have pure strength of mind and body forever. Then the gold injections will make me perfect. [grunting] [Jessie grunting] Let me go! You're hurting me. How in the world did you get here? I brought her. Let her go! You, Quest. You're like a bad virus. I can't get rid of you. Seize them! Give me a boost, Hadji. Sim sim salabim! Phew! Not a second too soon, Dr. Quest. pew pew pew Jonny, look out! pew pew I told you, let me go! Hold on, Jessie! Here, dad. - Dad? - Uh, I'll explain later. The game's over. - Let my father go, Zin. - Or what, boy? Shoot, Jonny! Jonny, shoot. Yes, shoot. I can't. A coward, just like his father. [dolphins clicking] [grunting] boom A-ah! The place is going to blow! Help! Let's get out of here! Flying dragon, Jonny. How'd you do that? We gotta get out, now! [rumbling] Ah! Jonny! arf arf arf Jonny, where are you? The rest of the plant's gonna blow! - Go on, dad. - Not without you, son. I got a way out. Go now! Jonny, no. [dolphins clicking] crash Son! boom (Zin) No! This can't be happening. No-o! boom Jonny. Daddy, hold me. We got a lot of catching up to do, Bannon. [Jonny coughing] Jonny! Dad! Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't worry, son. Zin did himself in. No, I'm sorry for accusing you of not shooting when Zin had mom. I couldn't take the shot either. You don't have to say anymore, Jonny. I know. I blamed you when it was Zin I hated all along. I'm sorry. Sometimes it takes a while to sort out feelings to say the right words. - I miss mom. - I do too, son. I wanna go home, dad. (3-DAC) 'Initiating re-establishment 'of all house functions, Dr. Quest.' It's good to be back in business, 3-DAC. Welcome back. [growling] Looks like Race is almost ready to leave. [snarling] Bandit, I have returned with a peace offering. arf arf (Jonny) 'Your old computer housing?' Gee, do you think Bandit will like the idea of using it for a bed, dad? Looks like he's going to sleep on it and then let us know later, Jonny. [snoring] Dr. Quest, Jonny, it's time to say goodbye. Well, this is goodbye, huh, Jonny? Yeah. Until we see each other again, I guess. mwah Don't ask. I just felt like it. What's the big deal about kissing anyway? Yeah. I'd rather go jet-skating any day. Me too. Say, how were you able to do that flying dragon kick back at Zin's place? I guess it runs in the family. [both laughing] Well, we're all set. Race, I'll understand if you want to leave I-One. Believe me, I know how important a family is. No, Dr. Quest, I signed on to protect you, Jonny and Hadji and I'll do my job. But you know, I've got a lot of back vacations stored up. I think it's time I started taking some of it. - Just do me a favor. - Anything, doctor. Go to some remote place where you'll be sure not to run into any trouble. Good idea. You know, I've always wanted to take a long relaxing sea cruise. (all) Bye! - Have fun. - See you soon. [burbling] [theme music]
