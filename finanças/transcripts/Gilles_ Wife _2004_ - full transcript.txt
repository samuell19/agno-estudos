Sorry. Are you okay? - Yes. Too soon. Hiya! Okay? - Hi, Victorine. Hello, Victorine. Stop it! I don't like that. It's dark in here. Aunt Victorine! You're filthy! It's bath-time. Hurry up, get your clothes off! Come here, you! Gilles! Can you help me? Bring some hot water. Look out! Come on, come on. In the water you go. Stand up now. Rinse yourself. I've brought your sister. Are you okay? - Yes. I think she was bored at your parents'. I'll take her out. That's nice, it'll be fun for you. Come on. Time for bed. Ouch, my tummy... Where are you going? - To the cinema, I suppose. I don't have much money on me. Strike it out. You elide it with "s" to pronounce it "z". Daddy! - Hello, girls. Come on, help me. I'm going out for a bit. You won't be too late? - No. Be good. I'll be right back. See you round! Where did you go? To Goblet's. Then I went down into town. Your boots are soaked. Is it that wet in town? They got wet on the way back. For you. Let's go to bed, Elisa my sweet. What's wrong? Worried about the baby? It's safe. Someone's filling in. It's my day off. I do Saturdays... - Were Mum and Dad in Sunday? No idea. I was at Simone's. You know, my friend, the redhead. The one who got married. Where does this Simone live? Up there. On the new road, after the wood. Those little houses up there. I wouldn't mind one but they're a fair way out. I'd miss the town. Time to go shopping. I'll see you to the gate. This is far out enough. I don't mind visiting you but I couldn't live here. Hey, sweetie pie! Silly, isn't it? Bye! - I'll come for dinner on Sunday. Give Gilles my love. "Sweetie pie"... We'll go on that one after but we'll go on this one first, okay? This is the important one. I mustn't miss now. A doughnut for the lady. Victorine, girls... Who wants a doughnut? Hi, Gilles, how are you? - Fine. Brought the family? Baby due soon? - If all goes well, yes. It's kind of complicated now. We need you. - As soon as I can. My turn now. Is it that fellow who spoke to you at the factory? Can't you dance right? Defending the family honor, Gilles? I'll shut your big mouth! I'll shut your big mouth for you! Let go of me! Gilles! It's okay. Trying to stop the kids from having fun? Let me dance with Victorine. - No. Pay up, we're going. Put your coats on. You mustn't dance like that! How? I was dancing normally. You were pressing against him. - No, it was him! Don't let him. I'll see her home. What could I do? - Tell him. Let's go home, Mum. Let's go home! Give him a kiss if you want. Gently... Already up? - I can't stay in bed forever. Hello, Mummy! You'll have to come home by yourselves tomorrow. Off you go. Need any help? No, I'll put the soup on. Gently. Go if you want. Got a needle and thread for my pocket? Let me do it. Don't be silly. Come on. Are you sure? I don't know how I did it. Let's play statues. - Yes! Spin round! A peacock! Spin. A crocodile. Spin. Spin again. Aflamingo. Cover yourself up! Doesn't Mum need you? I have time. I'll wait for Gilles... - Go home! I feel a little weak. Would an extra half-hour matter? Daddy... Bloody awful day. Bloody awful day. Careful, it's hot. Where's Victorine? - Out with her friends. Stop it and eat now. You won't wait for her? No, I have to go. The kids... Want to stay a while? No, I'll come too. Watch it or you'll fall in! Come on. Quiet, Daddy's tired. Let's go to bed. This'll do you good. Have you got the flu? Are you tired? We've had it. Talk to me. If you knew... Heartache? If you don't talk to me, who will you talk to? Her. Her? Victorine. Your sister. Want to try? Smoke? No, I'm a woman. Try for once. You get used to it after a while. You'll get over your crush. - It's not a crush. She's mine! She belongs to me! She's the one who said so: She belongs to me! If I didn't love her, I wouldn't feel this. When she gives herself, I have that body... It's mine! Lisa, you're hurting me. Give me some coffee. I need it. You're a strange woman, Lisa. You could have wept, made a scene, thrown me out... I'll wait. I'll wait till you're over it. I'll never be over it. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee... Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women... Blessed art thou among women as is Jesus, the fruit of thy womb. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and on our death. Amen. I'm listening. My husband... My husband is seeing my sister. I don't say anything. If I shout at him, he'll leave me so I can't do that. Father, I need help. I don't know... I don't know what I must do. In the face of the trials sent by God, resist all temptation to rebel against Our Lord. As penitence, you will say ten rosaries... Maybe you're right. I should stay put for a few days. We'll see what she does. I'll never manage it. If need be, we'll visit my parents on Sunday. I'll help you to wait. It's sunny. Let's go out for a picnic. Isn't Mummy beautiful? Come on. I bet she was surprised not to see me today. She stays in on Sundays. I wonder if that's true. Shall we check? No, not now. Aunt Victorine! Marthe! Marthe! Hiya. Can you mind the baby? - Okay. Elisa! Where have you been till now? You had me so worried. I had to see her. She has a new necklace. This morning, I stopped at Mar?chal's. She was just outside. Angry. She accused me of following her. Were you following her? - Not at all. Then she left and I went to work. I started thinking. If she thought I was following her, she's done something wrong. I must follow her. Where? - Everywhere. Follow her. Don't. If she notices, you'll lose her. I know my sister. I'll follow her. All I know is, she doesn't love me. I've been a bastard with you. If you say so, it's not totally true. I'm going out. Thanks, Mum. Hold on, I'll help. - Thanks. To the rise! Let's go! You're just a slut! Go on, yell! Yell, no one will hear you! No one will hear! - Cut it out! You piece of shit! - Stop it! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Help! - I'll kill you! Bitch! You're a filthy whore! You slut! You won't marry him! I'll fucking kill you first! Bitch! I'll kill you! We'll go far away. You won't marry him. You're mine. You won't marry him. Here. I only said I was marrying Mar?chal. I don't know what came over him. Of course you know. Fetch the kids from Marthe's. Stay there a while. Yes. Hello. Hello, my name's Gillou. There you are! Is Victorine better? Look what he did. What's wrong with Mar?chal? It only concerns me and Dad. Gilles is a lunatic. I don't want him in here again. You expected me to clear him? To say I fell down the stairs? The truth would do. What truth? I know about you and Gilles. I know everything. I've known for months now. If you knew, you could have kept him at home. Hold on. I have to tell you something. I met her. Victorine. Don't panic. I didn't feel anything. Nothing at all. I see how wrong I was. I've ruined the happiness I had. I don't understand why. Because of her. Some worthless girl. How did it all begin between you? It was summer, after work. You took the kids outside to wash them. Victorine started licking trading stamps. And... seeing her like that, her little tongue... her lips... I thought, "That's Victorine, "little Torine, I've known her for years. " Even so, I stood up, she came over to me, we kissed. While you were washing the kids. I don't feel anything now. It'll come back. No. I don't want it to. I don't feel anything now. Bravo! Fetch Gilles! - Gilles? Elisa's husband. Hurry!
