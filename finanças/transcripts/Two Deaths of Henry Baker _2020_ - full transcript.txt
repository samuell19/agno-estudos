We got so much blood together, you gotta do something for me, okay? There's a girl, has my kid at the end of the River Road. He's just a little boy, he got nothin' in the world, like I had all my life. I just wanted to give him some coins or somethin' in case... Even if... I know you never thought much of me. But I always looked up to you. I always wanted to be just like you. I know. Slide over, son. We're gonna drive, Hank. And we ain't gonna stop. But I gotta do something first. I'm just gonna be a minute. Well, if anything happens, you remember what to do? Gun's in the glove compartment. Hey. I'm gonna be back in just a minute. - Don't worry about it, okay? - Okay. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get you to carry this, and you won't know. Take real good care of it. I'll be right back. You can't come in, Sam, if you're not gonna stay. Are you Sam's girl?

Let me get you that drink. These are for you. - What's that for? - Something I owe Sam. - Take it. - Why? - I mean, it don't matter. - He told me about those coins. What did he tell you? They're for the kid. It's got nothing to do with you. There's blood on your shirt. It's a little to do with me. - What'd you do? - It's over. - What'd you do? - It's over! Grab him.

Is your father Henry Baker? I'm with the sheriff's department. Can I come in? He's been asking about you. Your address, specifically. We have people inside who pay attention to things like this. I don't know. I don't know why he'd want my address. I guess he wants to pay you a visit. Did you know that he was getting out? Hank? - Hey, Marianne. This is... - Ron Capman. Why, you have a beautiful home. - Thank you. - I'll be right up. Okay. You live here long? Couple years. You put a lot into it. - What's your living? - To sleep. Well, it must pay better than I think. It's not easy, what you had to live with. It's a burden. - What do you mean? - You know what I'm talking about. Things were taken from you. Boy should have a father. Things were left with you too, weren't they? You had to keep it all this time. Inside. You kept it, right? You know who I am? No, I don't know who you are. Let me help you. Get the fuck out of my house. I'm just trying to help. If you dig up the dead... it won't end well for you. Don't fuck with ghosts. They've got no substance. I do like what you've done to this place. My mother's a drunk. They weren't hers to sell. If they're hot, call the police. You don't have to be a dick about it. You know about dead fathers? It ain't any of my concern. What's a couple bucks? I'm talkin' about family here. We sell violins, too. I'm sorry mommy took your toys away, but it just ain't my concern. They're not sold yet, all you gotta do is pay for 'em. - What time you open tomorrow? - 10h. Don't sell my coins. I'm comin' back for 'em. - She knows what those mean to me. - Let's go drink something. You all get paid today? Don't go work the bar again, Sammy. Come on. Tell it to the opportunities. I take 'em as they come. You like that? It's nice, right? Bye, baby. - Bye, little man. - Bye. - How you doin'? - Good. See my friend there? He's cute, right? That's for you. Now that it's settled, so it's up to you. Right, you got, like, no contest. I knew it! There you go. Is he lookin' at me? Is he fuckin' kidding me? Fuck you. Hey! You can't smoke that shit in here. - What's it to you? - I don't want the contact high. Some of us still need the pop in our peckers, right? - Not like you. - Fuck you, Neal. I've ever seen someone smoke so much goddamn reefer. Hey, son, you ever get your dick wet? Or just follow your buddy around and lick all the leftovers off of his nuts? Let me think about that. I fucked your mother. She's got a pussy like an old sock. - You probably know that, don't you? - You're fuckin' queer. This kid, man, I swear to God. - You know what I think? - What's that? - I think you're afraid of me. - Yeah, you shake my boots. - Get the fuck out of here. - That's true though, isn't it? I make your dick twitch. You got all these ideas about what I do for money. And sometimes, on a day like this, got your paycheck beggin' out of your jeans. All that loneliness. You take a look over at me and think: "Shit. Maybe I would". - Makes you a little scared. - Fuckin' cocksucker. God knows I'm trying to be someone My vision's failing me I live like I'm dying tomorrow God gave me one last chance Take all the time that I've borrowed And make a new man They weren't lying There's no denying it - All right. - Hey, hey, take it easy. Take it easy! Come for me Wait up. - How'd you do? - Those guys got two minds. One for fuckin' and one for fightin'. And what have you got? I got one, but it's not made up yet. But you wait. When it does, it'll be the belle of the ball. You're Cinderella. Wanna come back to the house? Mom would like to see you. Plus, she's not such a gash when you're around. She just worries about you. - 'Cause I'm a bum? - Shut up. Hey, you'll never be a princess talking like that. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah. See you tomorrow, Cinder-elli! Ma? Is that you? Jesus. Shit. - Baby... - Come on. - Sam. - Come on, come on, come on. - Come on. - I fell. I know. Okay, come on. Gotcha. Okay, come on. - You were gone so long. - I know. I'm sorry, okay? Watch your step.

It's more than two hundred. You don't need your father. What you need is act like a man. Especially when people depending on you. I know. I know. You're my man. Right? You're my big, strong man. - What are you doing? - Nothin', I'm just... You surprised me. Nothin', it's just... Well, sorry, it's nothing. Please. Leave it! Sorry, it's nothing. Please. Marianne?

Okay. - What'd you say? - The coins are mine. Somebody took 'em, they didn't have the right. Where'd they come from? Maybe you don't understand. This seem real official? This is what you might call "extra-Caligula" for me. It's not often I get put in these situations, but they bring something out of me. I get excited. Don't test me for feelings, Sam. That's it, right? You're Sam Bird Jr. Give me the coins. Well, come on. Come on. - What do you know about 'em? - My father gave them to me. He's dead. Yeah. You know where they came from? It's a family thing. Have a seat. I thought about you and how you were doing. You came from the bitch side of the family. It's not your fault. Hey. All right. Why, he looks like your old man? - Your Uncle Henry. - I've never seen him. Not even a picture? Now, that's heavy. Here. You can keep that. - You know I wanna help you. - Can I have my coins back? Tell me about your ambition. That's what I mean. It's hard to fix a goal in life when you never had a manly figure. And the world won't feel for you. A little guilty maybe... but that'll only make it look away. No, son, you want to find your way to life... got to lean into your own intentions. Can I have my coins back? Get out. Be careful, Sam. What happened? - What? - I gotta do something. You want me to come with? Sam? I never told you about my daddy? Mommy said it makes you sad. She said that? Would you ever wanna meet him? Okay. It's okay, it's okay. Do you want to go for a drive? Yeah. Yeah, let's go for a drive. So what'd that cop say to you? He your Fairy Godmother? Sammy, just 'cause you got a hard-on to play this guy's princess, doesn't make me your damn and fuck pumpkin. All right. Hey. You know, Cinderella waited for the ball.

How's that taste? Been the sole custodian. The liquor's basic. But the business upstairs... - Women? - I ain't talkin' about cattle. But you can brand one if you want to. Maybe work up to that one. You might have forgot how it goes. Come on. Whole town been talkin' about you again. Like it 20 years ago. Yeah, it ain't that comfortable with me. - You got plans? - See my boy. - I always... - What? People just wondered, that's all. - Yeah? - Not me. Just people. What'd they wonder? That your boy kept you a secret about it. I only say it 'cause you mentioned. You got a friend in me, Henry. You can count on that. Hello. How you doin'? Lookin' for somethin' particular? - Just gotta make a stop. - Can I come? - No, you wait here. Okay? - Okay. Be good. - Yeah? - Yup. Now I ain't seen one in years, plenty of 'em before.
