One from the hardcore. You should look through this lie detector analysis. Yes? It's there for you to use. You must be joking. You normally have everything under control. Play the music. You know how it works. Today's code? Are you joking? Well, achieved anything yet? Would that satisfy you? We should have a good meal before heads start to roll. You did not respond correctly. It's not me saying that, it's from above. Interesting. Perhaps you should have come earlier. What is that? What's that got to do with your job? Quite a lot. I don't know. Not that it's my business, but I think you need a vacation... Why? What's more relaxing than working with you? Tell me, did you dream anything today? No, nothing. I did. I can't remember exactly. It was more a feeling... about you, about today. Do you really have to go there? If you don't know who your enemy is... you have to watch out! Hey, how does it look? Not bad. Looks like my gas station cap. Can you get free hamburgers now? Oh, that freak again. Stop it! Hey, I've got a job here. Starting tomorrow. Here? Are you crazy? What do you want? I'm bored of hanging around. But working here for minimum wage? And you? You're up all night doing what? None of your business. It's the money that counts. Finally I can buy some Creepers. Besides, if you don't like it, just go. That's what I'm doing. Good evening. One of your girls. Who? I think... that one. Her? Too late. She's gone home. What about her address? No way, sorry. Hello. Two beers please. Shall we buy some chocolate? No. No money. Cigarettes? No. Twenty marks altogether. Sorry, you'll have to give ten. Stop. You're not to touch the till. Bye. Okay then, bye. Of course. Whenever I played my new tape, someone stopped. You're crazy. I'm not interested in hearing your tape fantasies. Well, you're not listening properly. That's right. Did I tell you about my new death frogs? I could train them to be assassin frogs. So they can bite off men's cocks? Why not? But castration doesn't solve the problem. Did you know that Lady Diana gave birth to a frog? I read that they're a symbol of fertility or amniotic fluid. For the Mayans they symbolized the vagina... 'mucho'. Mums against muchos. I think the big M of McDonald's looks like a mother's tits. Big, fat and round. How about this.. super technician seeks attractive female? Large breasts, marriage a possibility. Meet at H-Burger. Why not in a peepshow? Don't start that again. Got a light? Don't. Not now. You were lying in my ear so nicely... Why, we rarely see each other. We don't always have to see each other. Why? Looks don't bite. No. But they burn. In the peepshow I sometimes feel as if I'm burning under a magnifying glass. But you're not burnt, are you? No, you know why? I think I'm an energy force. There was this guy, he had eyes like a laser. He wanted to slice me open. But I made it somehow. People with bad teeth, with herpes... with skin diseases, eczema or tattoos... are naturally not hired in jobs with direct customer contact. But where...? In the kitchen. Exactly. Remember that. What should our appearance be at work? Clean shaven, with clean fingernails and teeth and fresh breath. I use a deodorant against smell. At work I wear black trousers, black shoes and have groomed, washed hair. Like this one. Once again. The appearance of our waiters and waitresses... is of utmost importance... to our customers. And that brings me to the crucial question. What makes the H-Burger better than all the hamburgers, meat balls and rubbish of our rivals? The H-Burger is, of course, manufactured from 100% pure German beef... it is free of preservatives and food additives... and is grilled without fat. And anybody can look into our pots. We have nothing to hide. Therefore it is essential not only to keep your clothes in order... but also to always make sure that all kitchen utensils are in perfect condition. And smile! Smile! After all we're selling happiness. Did you dream anything? I can't remember exactly. It was more a feeling... Tomorrow I will start... I think I'm an energy force... ...he wanted to slit me open. Eyes like a laser... You know this must not happen with the tapes. I've seen them lying around here three times already. You know how important it is. Make sure it does not happen again. Didn't I tell you to lock up this cassette? If anybody gets hold of it, that would be a disaster. You'll keep the tape locked in future, understood? - They have everything under control. - What are you talking about? Please, listen to it. I don't want to. Piss off! You're not on today. But listen, I recorded this shit all day, please. No, I don't want to. Piss off. Leave me alone. Get lost, asshole! - Just listen, please. - No, I'm not in the mood. Piss off! Where am I? You were here before? You remember me? I remember everybody who ever came here. What do you want? It might sound silly, but when I look at you... Does the light reflect? Yes. I know it sounds silly... ...but there is something I can't explain. What's that? Okay, I'll tell you a story. Well, it's your money. A dream. I'm walking down a road. Nothing but fields left and right. I don't know where I am. The road leads straight on, endlessly. I think, I've never been here before. But somehow I know it all. Get it? And? And suddenly I see something on the road... you know, it's bright, shiny... and somehow it reflects in the sun. Well... I go up to it and want to pick it up... but it's slippery and slides out of my hands. And... what is it? I don't know... some kind of substance. An animal? I don't know. Why tell me all this? Couldn't we... ...meet somewhere afterwards? You wouldn't recognize me. Oh, yes, I would. I'm an expert at this. We'll meet again. Where did you come from? From outside. I don't have time. Can't you see that I'm working? Will you ever finish? No! Some things are more important than you. Oh, once again you feel misunderstood. Look, with this they have everything under control. Ah, yes... they have all in hand. You know what that means? Of course! Don't you care? Don't you notice that this is an old story? This kind of music has been used for a long time already. The Gestapo even used music to make people shit to death. Do you want to be on the front page? 'Scandal at H-Burger. Street boy reveals mystery of power of music.' It makes me sick. They have everything under control. It's true. It's true, it's true! You know what? You have no idea! Very funny. I don't think it's funny. You have no clue about music. No clue about music? Sure, you do have some idea of it. But you don't use it properly. I'll buzz off. Yes, buzz off! Finally you made it, Jager. These gentlemen are from the H-Burger Holding Company. They asked me, as security boss... to handle this very delicate matter. Take a seat, gentlemen. Bell, will you please explain it to him. There have been a few incidents... in some of our restaurants lately. We have good reason to believe, that certain groups, whose exact intentions we don't yet know... are systematically disturbing the smooth running of our business. It is not yet clear how, but these people have managed... to influence our musical system. Jager, what do you say? Where did you get this from? Bell, switch over please. To be able to eliminate further disturbances of this kind... we're planning a...let's say... a surprise attack. Quick, clean... and efficient... on the hard core of this... To the point, Bell! Alright then. Your task, Jager... is to take over a special mission within this operation. And what do I do? Nothing much. The same as you used to do for our friends. Remember that face. Why? I never want to see it again. Understand? What if I find it likable? Sympathy can sometimes be fatal. Hamburg. All persons who were sent to hospital because of suspected food poisoning, were sent home after a thorough examination. The diagnosis was not confirmed. The spokesperson of H-Burger denied that illegal sound waves... were the cause of this sudden sickness... and announced that this was technically impossible. Berlin reports heavy clashes between rioters and police. Keep your eyes open or you'll become a cropper! The riots continue. All large cities in West Germany report clashes with the police. The property damage of last week alone exceeds that of all previous riots. According to the latest information of the investigating authorities... there is a connection between the sickness that occurred last week... and the local riots. The police reported that during this week... more than 2000 tape recorders have been confiscated. The fashion among youngsters in cities... of walking around with tape recorders is spreading... Keep calm, gentlemen. Keep calm. We must maintain a state of calm in this situation. We have no ban on news. We only have a ban on information. This so-called "Burger War", never could have happened if H-Burger and Muzak Corporation had worked within the assigned legal limits. What? Switch over to channel 1T. They've got him again. This might be quicker. You used to be better. I'll give you another day. You make me sick. Since when are you so sensitive? Turn that murmuring off. It doesn't relax you anymore? You used to work with it, too. That's just as indigestible as your proletarian meatballs. Just as tasty, you mean. It's just bloating. What do you want? It's quite a natural flooding. And a profitable one. Perhaps you ought to look around for a new job. Something quieter. Can you imagine anything quieter than my job? Don't worry, I'll finish it. I might not find this face so sympathetic after all. Hotel Quebec calling 86. Jager, please report. Jager!
