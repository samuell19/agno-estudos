A person, arrested during the act of wrongdoing, is first briefly detained, and then, based on a magistrate order, is transported to the station courthouse. This person appears in front of a substitute prosecutor, who notifies her of the charges against her, and interviews her in the offices of the 8th section, After the interview, the person either makes an immediate court appearance, in which case she may consult with a lawyer before being judged by a public tribunal, or she may be set free, and given a court summons for a later date. We were allowed to make this movie under strict conditions drawn to protect the investigation's confidentiality, and professional secrets. Blonde, short hair? There are many substitutes. I don't know who's on duty today. If it's the one I saw the last time, I'm done for. - It's not important. - Do you have a record? Yes. In any case, the substitute will make a decision. Based on your... I'm not here because of drugs though, right? That's right. Concerning the affair at hand, you'll see her and have a chance to explain what happened. She will make a decision based on your record, the charges, and this interview. This interview is important. You can explain yourself. It's important. The substitute has 2 options: You can go to court today, - in which case... - I was caught in the act. Yes, but in any case, there are 2 options. You either go to court today, in which case you can consult with a lawyer. I didn't ask for one. You're free to refuse one, but if you're going to court... Might as well have one. Might as well maximize your chances. And then... The other possibility, which occurs rarely, is that you get a summons for a later date. It's usually within a month, but it varies. It's important that you show up, otherwise you're guilty by default. I have the right to one appeal. You are apparently familiar with this. Yes, very much. What happened today? Why are you here? Car theft. What happened? I don't want to tell you, because what I said previously was not completely... You're saying that your statements to the police do not correspond to... to what really happened, no. Why? Why? Because I do not want to be accused of stealing this car. I'd rather be just an accomplice, even if I weren't. OK. And you think this will... - That changes everything. - But do you think... that what you said will hold up, that there won't be... It contradicts witness statements, but people change their minds all the time, I'm not going to change my statement. I know what I said and I will stick by it. I will not change a thing. I'll ask you a few questions. You're free not to answer. It would be good if I could confirm your statements with someone you know. You're an adult, you have the right to refuse. I don't have to call anyone if you do not want me to. I'd like you to call someone if I go to jail. I've never been there before, and all my things are at a hotel. If I go to jail, my educator can go get my things. You're... You have a sponsor? He takes care of me free of charge. In which context? For what reason? He used to be an addiction counselor, and he quit, and then he met me, he liked me, and he wanted to help me out. He helps me voluntarily. What's the status of your addiction? Meaning? - Are you currently an addict? - Yes. - What do you take? - Mainly cocaine. Cocaine, OK. Do you use a lot? Much more than heroin. Since when? Heroin, since 87, when I was 16. - How old are you? - 22. It appeared... I mean, how did it start? I started... I did it at first just to try it out. During my rehab, I realized that... it was because of a problem, because there was a lack of affection... That's why people start using drugs. I didn't do drugs because my friends did too. That was just an excuse. So you've thought about the reasons? Yes, rehab helped with that. I was 18. Where did you rehab? - East. - East? And currently... Were you able to take advantage of the new understanding you got during rehab, or do you still... Do you still use drugs? I still use drugs, yes. Your name is Muriel Lefevre, born 04-05-71. - You're French? - Yes. You currently reside in a hotel? - What hotel? - Hotel... - Do you know the address? - No. How can I contact them if you can't remember? - The hotel? - Yes. You won't contact them. My sponsor will. Which arrondissement is it in? Must be... The end of the 19th and the start of the 18th. - So 18th or 19th? - Yes. Have you lived there long? - A while. - Meaning? 2 or 3 weeks. 200 francs per day. 200? Really? And where were you before that? Here and there. - How long have you been in Paris? - Since June. - Since June? - I've been smoking cocaine since June. So your cocaine use started in Paris? Where we you before? Saint Germain en Laye, with my father. - Do you see him often? - I call him. - How is your relationship? - Very good, but... When I visit him... What I need from him is not money, but affection. But the only way for him to show affection is to give me money. I don't need his money. - Are your parents divorced? - Yes. What's your father's name? - Same as me. - And his first name? - Is he employed? - He's an executive. Do you see your mom? Rarely. What's her name? - Her name... - Her maiden name. You see her rarely since when? For the past 11 years. I see her twice a year. Why is that? Because I do not like her husband. - She remarried? - Yes. She remarried 11 years ago. So your parents got divorced a long time ago? They got divorced because she wanted to marry a man 11 years younger than her. That's why... they got a divorce. - How old were you then? - 10. It was in 1980. Summer 1979, early 1980. - So your mother left? - Yes. Did you go with your mother, or did you stay with your father? Mom gave us an ultimatum: We either go with her, or we go to boarding school. Since I did not want to live with her and her husband, I chose boarding school. We eventually moved in with our grandparents. They were too bourgeois and catholic for my taste. My sisters and I stayed with them until my father took us back. Didn't your father have a say in this decision? I mean going to a boarding school. When she issued that ultimatum, my father was busy with work. He was not there. I said... 'Living with you is out of the question, so I'll stay with my grandparents.' And your sisters were raised... by my grandparents, and my father took us back in once he got his house back and got his issues in order. Did he have financial trouble at that time? Yes, because my mother put him in debt. But he... He got out of it relatively quickly, because he has a good salary, and he got some inheritance money. We owned some land too. He comes from a family of farmers, so... I was not born in a destitute family. But... It was out of the question with my mother... I wouldn't go with her. Do you see your sisters? Rarely. Don't you think... that it would be simpler to contact your father directly? I wanted to spend the holidays with him, but then I changed my mind. You stood him up? No, I did not stand him up. I called him a week before Christmas and told him I might come, - and then I didn't. - Why not? I went to sleep early, and spent Christmas day alone. - Were you sad? - Not at all. Christmas no longer means anything to me, Even though I'm Catholic. I was in a private school until... I was sixteen, and then... I went to a vocational school, to get my B.E.P. You have a B.E.P? - In what? - Secretarial work and accounting. And where you employed afterwards? After school, I worked in a police station. A police station? Afterwards, in an insurance company, a word processing center, a law office, and a real-estate firm. You've worked in a lot of places for your age. Did you typically stay long? The police station was a one-year contract. I stayed 6 months with the insurance company. The word processing center... They expected high productivity, and I typed slowly, so they fired me. The law office... I did not stay because of my situation... Because of drugs. I could not stay. In the real estate agency, I had to work Saturdays, which I didn't like. Was it not possible to work on Saturdays? Sure, I had done that before, but... I don't know. Let's not go into details. OK. What do you do currently? Are you employed or not? I am not. Are you registered with A.N.P.E? No. I get no social security. I see. How long have you been unemployed? A little while. Meaning? Tell me a little more. Let me think. I'm not sure, because I've always done business to get money. What business? I sell drugs. Is that so? That's quite serious. Don't write it down. But you tell me this quite bluntly... No, if you write it down... I'm not going to talk anymore. Are you going to show this to the prosecutor? I'm done. This is not the official document. I'll write it later. This can stay between us. I told you this because I thought it would stay between us. It will. Otherwise I'd rather go. I don't want more trouble. If I can't trust you... We're here, we're just talking... I am not going to... I'm not here to... to give you more trouble, but... We need to delve into your situation. If you show this to the prosecutor... I was brought here 3 times in one week because I had large quantities of drugs on me. Luckily, I didn't have much cash on me. - But... - OK. To be honest with you... By telling me these things, it's like you're provoking me. - You understand you're under arrest? - So what? You can't tell me these things and then... What you're telling me is not surprising anyway. You pay a daily rent of 200 francs. The money must be coming from somewhere. Anyway... Your money comes from business. - Prostitution as well. - Prostitution. OK. You're... Before June, you were in Saint Germain en Laye, at your father's. Why did you leave his home? I wanted to take care of my self, to be no longer dependent on him. - Was it hard to live with him? - Not at all. Not at all, but... The only thing he could give me was money, and that's not what I was after. Did you ever talk about that? No. He... He's pretty introverted, and... It's hard to talk ever since he found out about the drugs. When did he find out? Ever since... A year after I started, when mom kicked me out. So it was in 1988, right? Yes, 1988. So your mother knew before he did? Yes. I lived in Paris then. That's when it started. Heroin. And you never managed to talk to him about it? To my father? He wouldn't listen? We talked. I went to rehab, and came back... - Who decided on rehab? - I did. It was you? Why did you decide to go? At 18, I thought I should stop drugs. I'm 22 now, and I still do drugs. So something didn't... didn't change. I guess not. Back then I realized why I started doing drugs, but now... Is it already... I got used to it. I... I like it. Some people like drinking. I like... I like smoking. Are you in good health? - HIV-positive. - You're HIV-positive? When did you find out? 1990. Are you monitored medically? Every 6 months. My CD4 count is 1,400. My next checkup is after the new year. It's every 6 months, given that I'm healthy. 1,400 is like you, it's... It's a normal level. Once every 6 months is sufficient. After the new year, I have to go through tests again. I feel fine, though I lost 2 or 3 Kg. I feel fine. You're not undergoing any treatment? - Medical treatment? - AZT? No. I'm at 1,300. You take AZT if you're at 200. I can imagine that it's... it was quite a shock... No. For more than a year, I... I was certain I was HIV-positive before testing for it. - So you knew. - I didn't know, but I... Morally, psychologically, I braced myself by telling myself I was HIV-positive, So that on that day, the day I found out, I wouldn't be shocked. It didn't change anything in my life. I live with it, I don't think about it. I'm in good health. I continued boxing. I stopped just a year ago. You stopped boxing? Yes, a year ago. You were interested in boxing? Yes. It helped me get all the violence out of my system. There was violence? Thai boxing is one of the most violent forms of boxing. I meant inside you. Sure. We all need to exteriorize something. You seem to be... how should I say... You present things in a way... You seem to be holding up well. It must be quite hard though. If you let yourself go, you end up homeless. That's not my goal. What's your goal? My goal is to get out of here. I don't know. It's not to become homeless, and to stay positive. I'm in Stalingrad now. I can't go any lower. - I can't sink lower. - Where? Stalingrad. How do you see yourself... I mean... You said you couldn't go any lower, that you were in Stalingrad... You feel you're at the worst you've ever been. How do you think you ended up here? It was my own doing. Nobody forced me into this. How did it happen then? I don't know. It just did. Tell me... Pardon me. After rehab, you didn't... Did you not follow up with an counselor? No. I was expelled from rehab because I stole alcohol. I see. Were you expelled shortly after joining? About 3 months. The same thing happened... in the detox center out east. I escaped within 9 days. So you... You seem to force sudden breaks... as soon as you get support. Yes. Even if I sought it myself. This might be something to ponder on. Yes? Yes, but... How can I say this? I need to feel like I'm taken by the hand, like a little girl, otherwise... I felt that the people helping me were employees, they were just doing their jobs... they took care of me because they had to. - You didn't feel they loved you? - Who? Your caregivers. It depends on which people. You understand that... they're not there to love you, but to help you. - Yes. - To be... To help you out of your situation. What situation? The one you're describing to me. You say that you're responsible for your choices, but I suppose that you sometimes must feel unhappy about this. Sometimes, when I'm in withdrawal. I see. Have you given any thought to... reestablishing contact with a rehab center? No, what I want is a social assistant. What for? Because I have no social coverage, and I'm HIV-positive... I sought 100% coverage when I went to the hospital, but I have nothing else. What was the 100% coverage process? It was just for... It was a hospital letter, so my hospital stay was covered 100%. I didn't pay anything. But I still have to pay for my medication and my doctor visits. In any case, if you enroll in A.N.P.E... But how? I have no documents. We'll see about that. I'll give you the address of a social aid office. Where's that office? It's an office for people with no permanent address. That's what I need. A small room or studio. The hotel is too expensive. Yes, but... That's another issue. I'll also give you a number for a housing office. There aren't many openings. You have to be... You have to be strong. There's no waiting list, they get a lot of requests, so available spaces go quickly. If they have an opening, how do they contact me? You have to contact them. I'll give some phone numbers, and you'll have to contact them regularly. A space might open up one day. Whom can I contact for... - Can you call now? - No we can't. I'll do it from my office. You can't contact anyone now. I meant you could call. No, I can't. I think it is important to... You don't want me to talk to your father? No, not my father. No. What did he say to you the last time you spoke? He thought I looked good. He was surprised I visited him because June, July, August, September... It had been 7 months since I last called him. So he was quite surprised. I went because I needed money. To his house? You say you need his love, not his money, and yet... When I need money, I know he's the only person who would give me some. When I need 1,000 or 2,000 francs, he makes me a check or he gives me some cash... He always takes care of it. Does he know you're at a hotel? He knows nothing about it. He thinks I'm still employed. When did you quit work? A few months ago? - More than a year. - A year? I've been doing business since 1991. How do you imagine... the future? I want to get out of here, find a job. I think I can find a job easily. I have qualifications. I have a certificate. I've worked before. I can find something, secretarial or catering work. The problem is that I am staying at the hotel, which is inconvenient for the agencies, because they can't reach me in case there is an opening. You'll need to go to the agency in person. Sure, I can go there and give them my resume, but how would they contact me later? You'll have to contact them periodically. I think that currently... you might have other priorities, other things sufficiently... important for you and that the issue of employment is not foremost... not essential in the short term. Can I have a cigarette? They'll give you one. No, not now. It's the officer's call. You'll get one at the end of the interview. OK? He won't let me smoke a cigarette. They'll give you one on your way back to the cell. It won't be long. Give me one and I'll just put it in my pocket. I can pay you. I have some money. I always have money on me, just in case, especially in a stolen car. I thought... I knew I'd be caught. Yes? You knew? Sure, with the way I drive... A 2-liter engine. It goes really fast. You liked the car? Very much. It's... Of all the cars I've stolen, that one... Sorry, I took some pills. It's one of the most powerful I've stolen. I once got a super 5 GT Turbo... You "got"? I stole it. I always steal cars. Do you enjoy stealing cars? Powerful cars only. I wouldn't steal a weak car. Does it make you feel strong? No, not at all. What goes through your head when you see a powerful car? I feel like having fun with it, pushing it to the limit. Push it? Go fast? Yes. I love speed, and I'm a good driver. You have a license? What did you see in the car? What did you like about it? The fact it was... A 2-liter turbo. So you... It does 220 Km/H on the highway. Did you drive it there? Yes, I went on 15 and 86, and the whole interior boulevard. Is there a difference between the 2? There are no withdrawal symptoms with cocaine. Does your father see the difference? Sure. I started prostitution work when I got hooked on cocaine, around June, when I got to Paris. I had nothing to sell. As I mentioned earlier, you present your situation... You steal cars, you like speed... You did it although you knew you'd be arrested. I didn't know. You didn't? No. I... I don't want to go into details. I don't trust you. OK. I'll give you some contacts. Are you giving this to the prosecutor? I'll re-write this. I'd like to call someone first though. Can I call the person... your educator? I'd rather if you tore it up. Let's pretend I said nothing. I'll deny everything. I won't sign a thing. Why is it that you are unable... in your actions... you deny your statements... You do not own up to your actions once you realize... I owned up to them because I trusted you. When we first met, you said that our conversation will be confidential. I did not say that. I said the judges would see it. The judges? No, this... If the judge sees this, I'm off to prison. I'm not OK with that. I already told you that this stays between us, OK? There's no point in repeating all this, OK? If you show them this, you'd be sending me to jail. It seems to me that you're denying your statement. Technically, you're going back on your statement. You've been unemployed for months, your income comes from prostitution as well as other means. You have no social security, you're estranged with your family. Not estranged at all. Well... I can go whenever I want. Sure. In any case... Your father seems very worried about you. Yes, that's why I can go see him whenever I want. Does that... What do you get from... making him worried? Do you think you'll... What do expect from him? That he does something? I don't know. Can you give me the name of the person you're in contact with? - When will you call him? - This morning. He works odd hours. I'll try calling anyway. I'd like him to pick my stuff up in case I go to jail. Precisely. I have stuff, and a little money. I'd like him to pick it up. Can you give me his address? 40... 72-09. 34-66-Patrick. What was that? E-S. Echo sierra. It's the alphabet of... What's that? The police says Charlie for C, Oscar for O, Mama for M, Bravo for B, Echo for E, Sierra for S. Papa for P, Alpha, Tango for T, R, Romeo, I, India, C, Charlie, and K is... I can't remember. - Kilo. - And that's... This code, you... I worked in a police station. You worked there for a year, right? That's quite a coincidence. You used to work for the police, and now... Yes, to find myself on the other side of the bars, it's... Did you choose that job? It was right after school. Was it a non-renewable contract? A limited-duration contract. I was filling in for someone on maternity leave. So this gentleman... Is this his home number? - Yes. - Where does he work? - CNCF. - But where? I don't know. He moves around. I don't remember the phone number of... his office. What time is it? - 10:45. - That's fine. I'll try reaching him. I'm going to give you... a number of contacts. Are you going to show this to the subst... Sorry. The sub-s-titu..te? I am going to... rewrite it. I won't hand her this one. I hope so. Otherwise, I'd rather tear it up right in front of you. I'm not going to submit it in this form. It wouldn't be coherent for anyone unfamiliar with your case. This is what worries me. I am worried about it. Understood. If she has this, I'm going down. OK. What I was saying was... I'll give you the address of the social aid office. - OK? - Where is it located? Which hospital do you get your checkups in? It depends. Meaning? Would a social assistant help me in finding... housing and employment? It's not that simple. It's a project you'd have to take ownership of. I understand that I will need to be in contact with her, and call her regularly, and that we'll have to establish a relationship. Here's the address of a housing office. When can I go? As I said, you can call them. You can also go there if you want. It's a short-term housing office. - Meaning? - Meaning... prepaid hotel rooms, for renewable periods of up to 6 months. Who pays for this? Me? No, not by you. It's paid by short-term housing. It's subsidized. I'll give you... 2 addresses. What is it? I wanted to say something, but then... You thought better of it? What was it? No, nothing. As I said, this short-term housing office... You'll have to contact them often. You have to put an effort. OK? Effort is not a problem, but... One month? 2 months? It varies. There is no waiting list. If there's a room and you happen to call, you'll get it, OK? Your name is Muriel Lefevre. Born September 8, 1971 in Evreux. Correct. You are still OK with being filmed? Yes. Does my hair look good? You know, it's a documentary. - The point is not to make you look nice. - I was kidding. You are here for robbery. On January 4, 1994, you were caught in the act of jump-starting, which shows you have experience in that, not everyone knows how to do that, a vehicle declared stolen by Christophe Perin. I do not know if you were the one who initially stole the car, drove it away, got out and then got back in, or if it was someone else who committed the first theft, stripped the contact wires, and that you later got in the car. What is certain is that the same object may be stolen more than once, and that you were caught while attempting... I was attempting to start it to open the back door to get my clothes from the back seat. You were already inside. I'll read this to see if we're on the same page. - I do not deny that... - If you were already inside, it means you entered, and you could go out again, which means there was no need to jump-start it. Wait. Let me finish reading the file. 'She is stopped by passers-by, ' 'surprised to see the car, headlights on, wires detached, parked by a garage.' 'She', meaning you, 'had hooked the wires, and the engine was running.' That's what the witnesses said. There is a more precise statement in your arrest document. The officers were alerted and arrived on the scene, and the witness said: 'I surprised this woman, and my friend and I confronted her, ' 'while she was in a car, with the wires out, ' 'while she was attempting to hook them to start the car.' OK, then... There are other statements, including yours. Here's another witness, who said: 'It was 13:00 o'clock. I passed by the garage and noticed a car' blocking the entrance. I went to see if I could move it.' It was a Renault 21, right? 'I noticed that the wires were detached and exposed, ' 'that the box was open and the wires were disconnected.' 'I thought it was a stolen car.' 'I was about to call the police' 'when a woman entered the car and started the engine.' 'At that moment, I shouted...', to the other witness, 'to stop her. She was trying to escape.' 'I called the police...', etc. 'I want to add that the woman was seated in the front seat, ' 'that she hooked the wires and started the car. I heard the engine.' That is why I believe you were about to drive away. You've heard the statement. You may speak now. - What can I say? - The truth would be nice. I have nothing to say. This witness, who was very precise, do you agree with what he said? Yes, but I only hooked the wires to open the backdoor to get my pants, because the car was electric. You started the engine in order to open the backdoor? I didn't know how else to do it. You could just unlock the door. Maybe it wasn't possible with the wires. I don't know... You're saying you had no intention of driving away? I can't drive. Based on your version, you're at least guilty of fencing, since you were in a stolen car. - Why fencing? - Because you can't be inside a car if you know it's stolen. But I wasn't. Someone drove me when... I was in the car with someone, who parked very suddenly... But you must have seen the state of the car, that things looked wrong, that the wires were out. Yes, but I only asked him to give me a short ride. He's a friend? No, a drug addict. But you must know him since you got in the car. I was hitchhiking, and then, since we've seen each other around, he stopped when he saw me. When he stopped, you must have realized the car was not in a normal state. Yes, but I'm not the thief. I see. Didn't you consider not getting in? I was just going up the road. I should have walked instead. It's not wise to ride in a stolen car. You're sure you can't drive? I have no license. That doesn't mean you can't drive. No, I wish I could. I'll read this, and you tell me if I got it right, if I got your statements. 'I do not want to say anything.' 'I started the car just to open the backdoor, because it was electric.' 'I did not want to drive away. I can't drive.' 'An addict picked me up. I know him a little.' 'I realized the car was abnormal.' I mean stolen. No, I understand. So that everyone understands. 'But since I needed a ride, I got in. I shouldn't have.' Correct. Please sign right here. - Do you have a record? - No. Really? Look here. There is a record from 1991. 1991, robbery, 1991, suspended robbery sentence. 92, suspended robbery sentence. What were you saying? They're all defaults. You never show up to court? Did you change your address? Theft, theft, theft. All defaults. Default means you didn't show up at court. You did not receive the summons. I live in a hotel, so... You're hard to reach. That's why. Am I going to jail this time? It's not my decision, but you're going to see a judge. No default this time. You're going to be judged while present this time. This afternoon. Can I see... Can you show me these records? Your criminal record? Here. Shoplifting. They're all for shoplifting. - From big stores? - That's all I used to do. - Because of drugs? - Yes. Do you do a lot of drugs? Not anymore. - Much less than before. - Meaning? I mean I do it once a day. Heroin? Do you snort or shoot? Both. You're likely to shoplift again. You need money for... You must realize that. 2 ways to get money: Theft and prostitution. You need money for drugs. It's 6 letters. With two L's? Yes. No. - ELL. - It's written correctly. I noted it. You'll see a lawyer who'll help with your defense. I'll give him your record so that he gets some background, and then... - Are you a substitute? - Yes. Didn't they tell you I was? The previous time I saw a prosecutor directly. Was it for mandatory care? - Yes. - That's why. - Maybe it was me. - It wasn't. - There are more than one. - I would have recognized you. In any case, the mandatory care did not work. It did. I was trouble-free for 7 months. But you're back at it now. Yes, now I am. I confirm that you will go in front of a tribunal this afternoon, to be judged for this act. I repeat what you might have heard before, as long as you take drugs, you'll keep ending up here. On whether or not you'll go to jail, that's the judge's decision. That's all. You must understand that the car's owner has had problems. When you lose your car like that... Where was it stolen? It was stolen shortly before, so we don't know if you were there. The same thing can be stolen twice. You can steal a stolen item. That's all for me. You'll see a lawyer shortly, and then the judge later. I'll see you again. I'll be there. Your name is Muriel Lefevre? That's right. I'm going to be your lawyer today. - My assigned lawyer? - Correct. I was assigned by the court to help you. Free of charge. It's a service provided by the state. I serve in this role occasionally. I come here to defend people like you. I see that you have a record. It's all for petty theft. I see 5 instances. - Meaning? - You've been summoned 5 times. Yes, I defaulted. I see one record from Pontoise, for drugs. It was a case involving drugs. - Pontoise? - Yes. Petty theft with possession of drugs. You don't remember? No. Then, Versailles, theft. Versailles? Versailles tribunal. No? I've never been there. Then, Nanterre. Theft again. All these were defaults. You didn't show up. Lack of evidence. Sentence suspended. I'm lucky. Indeed. - Do you think I'm going to jail? - Tell me what happened. And then, prison? Tell me what happened. - And then, prison? - We'll see. We'll try to prevent that. - Ever been in jail? - Never. Never? How old are you? 22. 22? Born in Evreux. I'd rather hang myself than go to jail. Tell me about your life, then we'll discuss the case, and then we'll see about jail. We'll try to avoid that. You're 22. Do you have parents? A father. Do you have a degree? Yes, a secretarial diploma. You have a scar on your arm. Did you break it? What's that? A bad blow. How did it happen? - I fell. - You fell? Do you have a boyfriend? No. I live alone. I'm a loner. - Any kids? - No. You don't work? Unfortunately not. You have a diploma though. Yes, but since I stay in a hotel, it's hard to... keep a job. What are you accused of? - The reason I'm here? - You were arrested 2 days ago. Caught in the act. You were... I'm reading your file for the first time now. Tell me what happened. Well, I mean... I was with... a young man, who picked me up to go do drugs together. He parked very suddenly and walked away. I had stuff in the car, so I got in, and since it's an automatic, I jump-started it with the wires to get my stuff from the backseat. The police came, and some witnesses... how should I say? Witnesses blocked me from escaping. I knew I was going to be accused, even though I can't drive. That's all. Are you are a prostitute? Sometimes. Were you working that night? Yes I was. It says that you are known to the police. It means that, even though you've not been to jail, the police suspects you. Yes, only for petty theft. 'She was stopped by passers-by, surprised to see the car, headlights on, ' 'wires detached. She had hooked the wires, and the engine was running.' Do you know how to do that? Start a car with no keys? I just know how to turn it on. With no key? You can start an engine with the wires? I saw him do it. I'm not stupid. I saw him do it, so I figured it out. Tell me about the arrest. How were you arrested? A police car came for me. They took me to the station, then another station, and then here. "Two individuals were restraining a woman," "and she was trying to break loose..." Was there a fight? No. No. I'm a pacifist. I'm anti-violence. I'm checking for irregularities in the arrest record. There might be something that voids the case. - Yes? - I'd then inform the court, it would void the arrest, - and the case would be dropped. - That would be great. You'd be free to walk. - So I take my things? - Hold on. In case it happens. Sure, you'll get your stuff anyway. I had money. A lot? No, but enough. - You live in a hotel? - 200 francs per day. Are you an addict? I smoke. - Smoke? That's all? - Cocaine. No needles? - Heroin? - Not anymore. Are you healthy? HIV-positive. Are you ill? No, just HIV-positive. My levels are normal. I have the same levels as you. I get checked every 6 months. My next check-up is in January. They monitor my levels, even tough I have no permanent address. My health is important to me. That's why I still have all my teeth. I take care of my body. I don't let myself go. What did you tell the police? "I got in the car at 11:45. The driver was an addict. I was working as a prostitute." "We drove to a street..." "to buy drugs." "I lost sight of him, so I got in the car to fetch my things." " I did not try to start the car." "I was just trying to open the backdoor to get my stuff." "After turning it on, I noticed that the wires were exposed," "that the wires were ripped out." "The man had done it." "I had seen him before." "His name is Albert." "He's an addict." Was the prison OK? Any issues in the station cell? - Were they nice to you? - I guess so. What do you plan to tell the judge? - What should I say? - I don't know. Tell me first, and let's talk about it. I have nothing prepared. This is new to me. Tell me how you'll explain this. The fact you're here. - I don't know. - You don't? What did you intend to do with the car? Nothing. I can't drive. I just asked him to drop me off, and then... - That's all. - You don't have a license? No. I can't drive. Why did you mess with the wires? Because the door lock was automatic. I had to start the car to open the doors. - Is that true? - It's a Renault 21. I don't get it. You could have reached for the backseat. You wanted to get your bag from the backseat. But you were inside. How did you open the front door? - It was already open. - So you got in the driver's seat. You could have reached for the backseat. I didn't think of it. You have the right to lie. No one will stop you. It doesn't matter. There is no moral criterion here. You can defend yourself as you wish. But if you say implausible things, the judge will be angry. - What should I say? - The truth. Meaning? I don't want to go to jail. You'll go to jail for sure if you say nonsense to the judge. Judges are professionals. They're used to people like you. If you tell them nonsense, they will punish you. They'll go hard on you. If, however, you say the truth: "Your honor, I have never been in prison," "I don't even know why I got in the car. I don't know how to drive." - That's true. - There you go. Don't you think that's a more reasonable and coherent defense? It's better than: "I started the car to unlock the backdoor." - That won't stand. - No it won't. - Who's right, you or me? - You. You have experience. That's what you'll say. You'll say, "Madame Justice..." Mister president or Madame president. I think it is a lady today. "Madame president, I am a drug addict," "I am a prostitute, and I am HIV-positive." "I've never been to jail. Never." "Never, Madame president. Never been to prison". "And now..." "It is true that I was doing drugs in the car, but I can't drive." "I have broken the law," "but, what for?" "My actions were aimless." "I couldn't drive the car away." - True. - There you go. "So, Madame president," "I have done an idiotic thing. My whole life is idiotic." "I do not know where I am going. What I know is this..." "I do not want to go to jail. I've never been there before." OK? If you tell her that while looking her straight in the eyes, with a steady voice, you might succeed in mollifying her. I only ask one thing. Don't talk nonsense. Otherwise, it will be bad. Can you repeat it so I can remember it? No. I won't, because you'll say it without having to learn it by heart, because it's the truth. OK? Just say who you are, what you did, and why you did it. Why is there no 'why'? "I don't have a permit, and I can't drive anyway." "The only thing I want is not to go to jail, Madame president." That's how you start: "My name is Muriel. I am a prostitute," "I am a drug addict, I am HIV-positive," "I have no license, I was trying to steal a car, but I'm not sure why." "It was pointless." - I wasn't trying to steal it. - "I was trying to start a car." "I couldn't have stolen it, because I can't drive." - No, I can't. - Very good. Will you tell her that? I'll defend you later. I'll try to defend you the best I can. I won't see you again? You will, in court. You'll be in the accused box. We won't be able to talk to each other much. You have anything else to tell me? You want me to call someone? You can call. Who do you want to call? My tutor. My educator. - If I go to jail, I want him to... - Have you not called him yet? They tried, but he wasn't there. What's the number? - Do you have other friends? - No. I'm alone. What's his name? "Vehicle theft." They'll pin it on me. No answer. Anything else to tell me? - Nothing? - No, wait. So I'll tell the judge... I admit that... that I started the car, but it was not my intention.. No, you were just trying to start it. Yes, I was trying. I tried to start the car, but she'll ask me why I did. That's what I was asking you. I don't know. Well, tell her that. 'I don't know.' " I don't know what I'm doing." "'In any case, I don't know how to drive. I don't have a license." I can't even drive. "I can't even drive." OK? Is she a nice judge? - Yes. - Is she tough? A little. It's her job. She judges. Did you see the prosecutor? - Yes, a woman. - Was she nice? She asked me how I was doing, and I asked for a doctor. You initially refused to see one. That's what's written here. Do you want to see a doctor? What did she say? She said she'll take care of it. She said she'll get me one. Can I see one now? Sure. OK. We'll see about that. OK? I'll see you later.
