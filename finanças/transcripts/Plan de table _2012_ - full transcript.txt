Do things really happen by chance? Yes. Polar opposites have no reason to meet. None at all. A ticket to Avignon. And yet... On the next train. A ticket to Avignon. Chance can work wonders. It can spur encounters that seemed against all odds. Pardon me. Is that seat taken? Love Lasts Three Years I love that book. When she dies at the end, it's.. beautiful. Thanks. I just started it. I was kidding. I've never heard of the book. It was silly. I'm sorry. What's silly is you have a booger here. Chance decides everything and we're powerless. - Very funny. - Just like you. Six years later Hold on... If I meet a guy, I'll keep my cool... Looking for love at your sister's wedding... how pathetic. How are you? Yeah, it's great. Cool. Want to meet later? Great... See ya. Shit, it's stained! Yuck. Paper bag. Antoine says I look like Scheherazade. I say Turkish taffy. Antoine. First call all week. Lucky me! He's like my cell phone. Fine till a new model come out. Where's my tuxedo? We'll be late. I want to fuck. And I'll fuck... today. Cut it out. I don't ovulate on demand. I don't get hard nonstop. Damn... Pack up your pineapples. Finally. Late for my cousin's wedding. Where were you? With my mistress. Pierre! Bathroom. I had very painful gas. It was Hiroshima. No details. Then don't ask. Mommy, what's gas? Happy now? It's when you fart. Start the car. Seat belt. It's stuck! 8 times. New record. How about a smile? Now get a little closer. You look gorgeous, miss. I have the same one. With a 70 mm. Mine's a 120. I'm a photographer too. How did they choose you? They wanted something artistic. I have a real sensibility. I'm perceptive. I have an eye. For the newlyweds... I have two... Asshole. I'll do it... Go on. They're coming. Marie. Say it. If I do, it'll be even worse. We think it's all chance. Even when we hold the cards. Yet change is in our grasp. Easy on the champagne. Why are you a pain today? I can't find us. - "Mimosa". - Let's go. What were you up to with the groom? - You got it wrong. - Yeah, right. I'm so happy. You're beautiful. No, you are. I mean it. Thanks, sis. Get going! Marjorie Gillis... I don't know her. David Le Bacquer. You're pale as a ghost. I don't feel well. Go on. Again? Are you sure? Aurore, Vanessa, come on... Here they come! Cheer them on! Chance can be on your side. But not always. I hate chance. I hate when it ends badly. And I won't let it. A round of applause for our amazing newlyweds! Tonight we'll party! We'll carouse! We'll paint the town red! I'll see to it. So? We didn't want a hick wedding. I didn't choose the guests. You look great in a suit. It's rare. But it's now or never. About what happened... Like old times. Oh yeah? Never again... Everyone settled? Great seating arrangement. I find you much... less... or more... Hands off my sister's ex. 1) She's married. 2) She seated us together. You own that gallery? I called several times. What's a spit-roasted glazed banger in a puff pasty wrap? Pig in a blanket. You didn't hear my name: David Le Bacquer. Sorry. Stop. Never heard it. I'm slightly famous. Stop! Wine? I forget what your husband looks like. Handsome. He's someone who's very... very elegant. You don't remember? He was at the Chiaroscuro show. Pierre, the doctor. Yes, well... surgeon. Surgeon. 10:30. The waltz. Then the cake and the surprise speech. - Which takes us to 11:25. - Fine. Then the dance... No, the dance. We'll touch base at 11:30. Read me? Loud and clear. Pierre! I saw the photographer you chose. I could have taken pictures. You find wedding pictures tacky. For Marie I'd have tried. Where's your girlfriend? I just dumped her. And came to my place with your suitcase. I didn't expect you. - I'm moving on. - Like Marie. You seated Eric with your sister? She needs to settle down. So does Eric! Did I screw up? Here's Marie at her 10th birthday! So young and already so pretty! Who's that fat girl? You recognized her! Her big sister, Marjorie! If she keeps wearing dead fish on her head, we'll never manage! Pierre? Quick, quick... Say something! I'm a virgin. No, I mean Virgo! What about you? Pisces. Pisces and Virgo always hit it off. It's time for the surprise. The famous speech... I call the bride's sister to the mike. I'm not great with speeches. Or with much of anything. I'm so happy for you... I won the Montreal Photo prize. I love Quebec. Montreal in Ardeche. You never could make up your mind. You take ages hesitating between a Niçoise salad, a hot dog... I do all sorts of photos. When you met Paul, you chose hot dog. Where's the gallery? Stop in. I'll check out your book. Great. I'll call you. Watching you two... all I see is happiness. As well as love. That's so rare. If that's what marriage is, sign me up. I want the same one. Congratulations! No news from your husband? It must be an emergency. Big specialists are always in demand. I'm really sorry. How awful! I'll go wash it off. Can you come? - Ready now? - What? Keep quiet. What are you doing? - Take a guess. - You're crazy! Sit down. It's easier. Now taste my pineapples. Look at this! I love it when it's not planned! Everyone on the dance floor! Music, maestro, please! What the hell? I hear it helps fertilize! What? Nothing. Come on. Yours? A 304 convertible, 1973. It's for sale. Like it? It's gorgeous. How much? The car. 5000... 4000... Where were you? I was looking everywhere. I made up excuses. I had to make small talk! I came across as a total idiot! Shall we go? I'm not well. I was in the bathroom. I emptied myself out. You have a mistress? Diarrhea. Not exactly the same thing. Get me starches to stop it up. Get the girls too. - Starches? - Yeah. And the girls. And the girls. I'll call you. Rule 16: If he says no to sex at first, he's decent. Eric! My number. He still has my number. He'll call. Or at least text. He has 3 days, the legal limit. He may be near his phone, thinking of me. Sitting alone in his club chair, dim lights, a little jazz. Obsessed by the thought of me. A real class act. Thanks for waiting last night. You left with Marjorie? In her gorgeous 304 convertible. And her? Go on. She was hungering after you all night. You into someone else? Too late. She's married. That's why they have divorce. Think she'll divorce the day after her wedding? Shit. You got that right. Fuck. That too. - Let's go. It's time. - Go where? Do you do it on purpose? I'm ovulating! I stopped by the lab yesterday. They had my results. I'm sterile! So no more thermometers, no more handstands. What does that pain want? Pierre, it's me. Coming for lunch? Don't wait. I'm operating. I'm saving a life. See you for dinner. Paul likes airplanes! Did I make the right choice? Living in the country? You'll love it! Mad cows, GMOs... cow manure... It's total bliss. I meant Paul. It's too late to freak out. I'm so confused. What is it? He's not pretty enough? You want to exchange him? For a different one? Tell me. Is there someone else? There is... Who is it? It's Eric. Can we meet for the car? Yeah. Sure, no problem. Take care. Don't get worked up over Eric. He's the one who called. Who's giving you doubts about marriage? Planes, planes. It's crazy. You okay, honey? I'm fine. Except that I had dinner alone. Sorry, it was 1 am. I didn't want to wake you. It wasn't 1. It was 4. I wasn't asleep. I never sleep. It's unbearable. - Full moon? - Exactly. Two hours to iron a shirt. She's no genius. You're losing your hair, Helena. You sure you're okay? Of course. I'll get ready... and I'll get the girls. Nice, isn't it? And the inspection? I'm second-hand but a good deal. Listen, Marjorie. I wasn't very up front but... we won't go any further - Why are you here? - To buy the car. You have someone? Why did you kiss me? Not to piss off my sister... We can't have kids. You can't. I want a divorce. Great... I'm sterile, so you want out. Am I a breeding bull? A sperm factory? Don't you understand? I want a child. I'm dying for one! There's no future. What do you think? It drives me crazy to know I can't have one. But it won't kill us. It will. What now? Time to call our lawyers. I like the French one. It's old-fashioned. It's a 1971 model. This one is from the 90s. Fuck, I forgot about him. - David Le Bacquer. - I know. - We met at the wedding. Catherine? - That's right. I'm the publicist here. Find your husband? It's a delicate balance. I can do portraits or nudes. But that's too easy. Too bad. An ass in the tundra would help. What? These aren't even postcards. Your best bet is the Girl Scout calendar. But it's beyond me. Get lost. Fuck. See the time? I know. I'm coming. I'm coming. When I picked up my pictures, I forgot the negatives. I've already told you. It's digital. No negatives. I want my negatives. Customers come first. Give her the negatives. But... You'll amount to nothing. How are you? - And you? - Fine. All alone? I'll explain. It's cute here. - Paul's not here? - He went to buy bread. You found him. Tell me about it! His beeper went off! What bad luck! Classier than "the runs". How are you? - Here. - You needn't have. Baked Alaska glazed with liquid nitrogen. I hear it's just divine. Here's Paul. Did I buy too much? It's fine. Remember, it's molecular cuisine. It was frozen at minus 196°. Enjoy it. We all die sooner or later. I love it. Love it! It has a pretty strange taste. It's on purpose. There's no taste. Your house is just stunning. We wanted 4 bedrooms. It's the minimum. For the kids. I understood. For the kids, we have time. But... it's best to plan ahead. Life's sad without kids. Liquid nitrogen is lighter than air. It rises. So you burp. If it were heavier... you'd fart. Excuse him. That's why we wanted a garden. This way we can have a dog. Marie can plant bulbs. I like tulips. There's something else... With Eric, I didn't keep my cool. What do I do now? I call Antoine. As usual. Antoine, it's Marjorie. This is my third message. So... call me back. Take care. You'll think I'm capricious. Maybe marriage was a mistake. Hitting on my sister was dumb. Yeah but look... It worked. Stop it. Listen... I miss you. I want to see you. Can you come? Now? Really? Can I count on you? Just once? Yes, you can. Say it. I will when you're here. Not now. Chance decides everything for us? That's what I thought. But when you hold all the cards, everything is possible. And everything can change. A lot. We'll party! We'll carouse! We'll paint the town red! David Le Bacquer. Photographer. And you? Edith. My husband has the Chauvet Gallery. It's very well-known. So I hear. Not bad. He's like Beethoven. Only handsomer. I'm Marjorie. Sister of the bride. I'm Arnaud. - Wine? - I'd love some. Catherine? What's Pierre up to? See the chandeliers? They're gorgeous. I'm Catherine, the groom's cousin. Eric. I'm a... friend of the bride. You must be happy for her. About what happened... - Like old times. - Never again. Everyone settled? You two look so happy. See you later. It's true. They make a great couple. They're good-looking. They go well together. They're obviously in love. And Marie... she's really into him! What's a spit-roasted banger in a puff pastry wrap? Pig in a blanket. Honey... can I have some wine? Great idea to seat me between a couple. Nice atmosphere. I tried calling the gallery, but to no avail. I'll take care of it. Arnaud. What? This young man can never reach you. I talk work at work. His name is David Le Bacquer. So what? He's from Auvergne. They're tough, but I'll manage. If you're nice. In fact, it's funny because... Paul reminds me of Pierre, my husband. It was love at first sight. For me, Paul is really the perfect husband. He's generous, natural... He seems tender, gentle. Tell me. Your husband. Where is he? I didn't expect you. And miss this masquerade? - I should be the groom. - Relax! You couldn't hold onto her. Because you showed up. And took her away. She left you. So I moved in for the kill. That's all you do. Pick up leftovers. - Scavenger! - Say that again. Marie... How are you? What's got into you? Are you crazy? Who's that fat girl? You recognized her! Her big sister, Marjorie! If she keeps wearing dead fish on her head, we'll never manage! She could have seated you near a single guy. Plenty here. Like who? Like him. Spare me. Really? We needed a sailor in the family. We found him in Paul! Mostly landscapes and still lives... What my husband likes are nudes in black and white. Black and white nudes? My specialty. You know, sometimes... I pose. I have amazing breasts. Really amazing. Cool... That's important. Good evening. Pierre? - What? - Expiration date. Who cares about that? It's today! This is bullshit! Surprise time. The famous speech. I call the bride's sister to the mike. Marjorie! I'm not great with speeches. Or much of anything. My little Marie. It'll be fine. I'm a wiz with speeches. By getting married... The same thing. Thanks. Champagne! By getting married so fast, with Paul and his life so perfectly orderly... you didn't make a mistake. With him... you'll be sheltered from everything. Except... except maybe... definitely... boredom and mediocrity. We're having fun. We're celebrating your sister's wedding. As for you, Paul... I'll see to it. you and your manners, your ironed shirts, your pleated pants! Not a hair out of place! It didn't stop you from stealing Marie! Let the party continue! I'm sorry. I didn't want this. Of course you did! I waited for you to propose. So many chances. Bali, Barcelona, Greece. Not a word, nothing! Why did I fall into your arms again? I'm so dumb! Time for la musica latina! Here we go! I'm sorry. How awful! It's nothing. Put water on it. Do it now or it won't come out. Antoine? I'm still at my sister's wedding. Why are you saying that? Where were you? Where are you? I looked everywhere. I came across as a total idiot! Pierre! There's an echo. I can't hear. Antoine? Pierre? Fuck, I'm dating a married asshole. I didn't even know his real name. Are you okay? No, yes... I don't know. Were you leaving? No. I mean yes. I better drive you home. My car's there. I bagged Beethoven. Not the dog. I'll keep my cool... I know what's next. "Gotta run. I'll call you." Gotta run. I'll call you. "You understand. I'm married." I'm sorry. I've never done this. I'd love to have spent the day. Or more. We don't always get what we want. Can I call you? I'd rather not. Want to talk about it? If ever she sees you again, it'll be to slap you. It can't end like this. It's ugly with a feather. He's passed by every day since. I'm seeing him next week. He wants to buy my car. I need money. So who drove you home? Arnaud Chauvet. Oh yeah? No ulterior motive. Obviously. You know me. Wife and mistress at the same table. Can you imagine? Marjorie Gillis... Never heard of her. Catherine spies now. And she won't give up. She won't find a thing. My sex life is like a Swiss watch. Thought out, organized, calibrated. The work of a master craftsman. Don't wait. I'm operating. I'm saving a life. See you for dinner. I cover my tracks. I use fake names. Antoine, it's lovely. I'll say. You look like Scheherazade. I only have 20 minutes. You're losing your hair, Helena. I'll get dressed. I'm the Einstein of adultery. Picasso of the quickie, Mozart of the dickie. Take care, honey. I missed you. My honey-bun. Game! Set! And match! New ball. So your name isn't Stephane? I can tell you... My real name... is Maxime. Take it off so I can see. I know exactly what this guy wants. I don't pose naked. That's no way to become a top model. Claudia, Linda, Naomi did nudes. Carla too. Gorgeous. Relax. Give me a smile. Try a little... intelligent. Not intelligent... Mysterious. Gorgeous. Nice, isn't it? My wife was right to insist. I'll give you a show with this. This is great news! I'll get started with invitations, publicity... You? - Me? - Who banged my wife. Out! Out, I said! Arnaud... I'm pregnant! And I'm sterile. I want a divorce. Time to call our lawyers. And a red feather? I said don't call. No, but try this. Enough! No more messages. Stop following me. It's harassment! It can't end like this. Orange with a blue feather? Tell me. Just tell me once. You're a psychopath! And blue with a red feather? Shove your red feather... Excuse me? I'm not married. I'll keep my cool. You know the wing of the P51 Mustang I screwed up? "The lower surface is flat, "so assembling the wing should not be difficult "for an intermediate model-maker." That's wild. Hello, Antoine. Or should I call you Pierre? I met your wife. She's a blast! My wife... I never mentioned her because... she's sick. Can't we meet up? No, we can't. I'm with a man. A real one. This guy's penis is humongous! What a nice change. I have to go. We're busy. Doing what? I don't know. We're going to... have kids. Can we talk later? One down... ten to go. You okay? - What is it? - I'm leaving. What? The two of us... we weren't meant to be. How did it go? He didn't like the pictures. He sure didn't. What now? I'm going to sulk, like you. I'm not sulking. You are too. No wonder Marie's fed up with you. Marie, I came to apologize. That sucks. Marie, I came to ask forgiveness. Not great either. How are you? All alone? I'll explain... What a nice place. You found him. Tell me about it! His beeper went off. - Here. - You needn't have. Baked Alaska glazed with liquid nitrogen. Here's Paul. How are you? - You okay? - I'll see to it. He tried to kill him! - No! - Yes. I'll call the cops. I came... It's for an attempted murder. Are we mere victims of chance? A few place cards can't decide what we make of our lives. Mimosa. - Mimosa? - That's right. No place cards. Where do we sit? Wherever you want. David Le Bacquer. Photographer. Have you ever posed? - Posed? - As a model. Very funny. Looking for someone? Look at the beautiful candles. Wonderful ceremony. Ave Maria gave me goosebumps. I love classical music. And you? Some wine? Not for me. I hate to drink alone. - You'll have to. - I won't insist. About what happened... - You forgot the place cards. - Yep. Everyone settled? We're fine. What's a spit-roasted banger in a puff pastry wrap? Pig in a blanket! My photos are famous all over. You never heard of me? Sorry, no. What does he look like? He's someone... very, very classy. And an excellent surgeon. Really? Where? Shoo. At the C.H.U. How did Tristan Bernard define marriage? "Two people solving problems they'd never have had alone." You're married. Congratulations. Thanks. Staying married is a real job. Difficult but... thrilling. Difficult, yeah. Especially if she's married. That doesn't matter. As long as she's happy. Happy. I'd like to toast the bride and groom. Long life together! It's in three-quarter time. You make a square. I'll show you. Three, four... The secret is in the eyes, not the feet. Look her straight in the eye. - Like this? - Very good. Why do all this? So it goes well. So she'll be happy. She is. You'll love the great house we bought. But if she keeps putting dead fish on her head, we'll never manage. It looks nice on you. - Really. - Thanks. Does your husband work in Emergency? Yes, he does... Why are you asking? I wondered if I knew him. I don't think so. What's his name? His name is Pierre. No, I know Antoine. You see? You... you're in love. We all have problems. Best way to forget a woman is to sleep with another. Not any woman. One who experienced, good with her hands, and who loves a good work-out! I'm pretty clumsy. But the DJ keeps staring at you. Really? Isn't he classy? And the speech? Where's the DJ? - Not bad. - Isn't it? I'll see to it. I'd like to thank you all for coming. I like weddings. Me too. When I entered Marie's shop, I knew it was her. I asked for her number. Next day, I invited her to dinner. You know the turbo boost? What is it? Romanticism, efficiency, rapidity. Isn't that happiness? Thanks, and enjoy. Sorry, ma'am. This is awful. What a catastrophe! And it's an Yves Saint-Laurent. - Stop! - Five more seconds. So? So get lost. Yeah, right... You smell nice. Pierre? I hope you feel good. I feel great! Time for la musica latina! What do you do? Looking for a job. I found you one. Will you pose? I'm not starving. - It's not for money. - Now I'm sure! You ooze charm. Can you ooze charm? What am I, a pimple? Not everyone has charm. She's pretty, but no charm. You're totally hot. I want to prove it to you. We can't go on like this. Kids change everything. We'll be less free. Stop. I was wrong. I thought a kid would help. But it won't change a thing. First let's get back on track. You and me. As for kids... we'll discuss it later. If ever we want kids... That's no longer relevant. We're what counts. You want to keep on with me? Want it to work out? Sure I do. So say it then. I do. I'll start by stopping this. Okay, but what will you do? Me? I'm flawless. Idiot. You're grumpy. - That's not a flaw. - You bet it is. Let's dance. We're bored. Got anything peppier? It's my technique. First I soothe them, then I electrify them! I'm stealing her. May I? Where were you? I looked all over. Shall we go? Rule 42: If he wants sex the first night, he's bad news. My car's here. I came across as a total idiot, Pierre! Antoine? Just a sec. You're right. He's a real class act. Do you know her? You think I'm someone else. Someone like Antoine? He's single. With a beauty spot on his foreskin. Not you, is it? Have a good night. You can't believe her! Shut up or you're dead. You know him? I guess not. Look at me. Don't move. You're beautiful. Excellent. Don't move. You're beautiful. He finds me that pretty? He'll put me on Vogue. Or naked on the Net. I'll keep my cool. I know what's next: "Gotta go..." Any plans? I could photograph you all day. No need to keep cool! Cut it out. This is ridiculous. I slept with that poor girl just once. It's not cheating. It's comparing. Excuse me? Once. Just once, Catherine. Long enough to notice your beauty mark! How incredibly perceptive! It lasted a minute. Lucky her! All I get is 45 lousy seconds twice a year! Relax. Where are you going? I'm not going. You are. Where do I go? I don't know. Wherever. Call your mistress. She can keep on exploring your anatomy. You'd love a colonoscopy. Catherine! I can be gross too. - It has wheels. - Shut up! Okay, I made a mistake. You never made one? Yes, once. - See? - Marrying you. Why make a big deal for nothing? For nothing? I can't believe this. I put your career first. I sacrificed everything. "Catherine's so perfect!" I listen to Vivaldi, never the Clash. Yes, I love the Clash. I'm always perfect: manicure, pedicure, always made up. Even at the beach! A brushing a day, even though I'm frizzy. I'm such an idiot! Fuck all that stuff! I could live in thongs! Thongs? I loved you. Catherine. On the count of 3, I'll leave. One. Two. Three. Four. Before the wedding, I went to the lab. For my results. Arnaud? I'm pregnant. Impossible. Don't look too happy. I am happy. You don't look it. I'm going to be a daddy. What about the results? The results? Everything's normal... Can't you tell? Shit... I want to print pictures from a USB key. No problem. Hold on... Can you see to her? - What are you doing here? - Working. I get it. Your shows and photo shoots were just to screw me? I can explain. Don't bother. I'm not proud to work here. So you lied? I can't live off my pictures. What we shot won't go to waste. It'll work out. I got naked for your pictures. Naked! I hate being used. I didn't use you. I need time to make it. Get it? Yes, but I need trust. Get it? Yeah, I get it. So we get it. Yeah, we get it. Anger suits you. You're cute in this. Stop it. Paul has a friend with a gallery. He was at our table. How are you? - Not bad. - Charming. You seem happy. We'll explain. - Where's Paul? - Buying bread. Hi, everyone. How's it going? And you? You needn't have. It's nothing. Apple pie. - I love it. - So do we. Pierre's not here? No. I left him. I don't believe it. I did... That's life. - You okay? - Yeah. I bought too much. A little. Let's go. I'm starving. Come on in. We're all hungry. What's wrong? Catherine left Pierre. Too bad. I'm so stupid. I should have decided this years ago. The clock keeps ticking away and then... One day you wake up. Years have gone by. You realize you've lost time. Life's too short. Apple pie? You're not interested? Sure it does. It's like with the house. A 25-year loan is long. But it's an investment. One day we retire. It's important. It creeps up on you. You're depressing me! Why are you here? I left my wife. For you. How dumb do I look? Now we can be together. I'm free. I'm not. Marjo! Little princess! Unbelievable. Without her I'm lost. She sees to everything. I like when everything's perfect. When my ties match her dresses. And her dresses match the girls'. I don't know who to turn to. She even kept my Mercedes. Want my Peugeot? A steal at 5000. 8000... 1200? And the papers? You have a style, an eye. It's new and exciting. Just what we need. Can we do a show in 10 days? Of course. Some cropping may be necessary. No, why? Like this, it'll be more modern. Trust me. You're a lucky man. This show will be a smash. To the show. And the move. What move? I'm leaving here and moving in with Marjorie. No, I'm moving out. Stay. There's more room. Your equipment's here. It's your place. Yeah, it is, but... I need to move on. Where to? Marie's old place is free. I'll call her. - That's not a good idea. - It is. So? So... I won't be taking it. I like it. It's pretty. It's big. But it's you. So we're done? Want a bite to eat? You know how people talk. Salmon? Tuna? Take the tuna or we'll be here all day. I finally understand. I can't compete with Paul. He can make you happy. All I have to offer is... raw fish on the floor. Pathetic for a chef. It's the service that counts. You said yes to him. He asked the question. What question? A question like "Will you marry me?". That's all it took? It's enough. Paul is too perfect. He pops the question like a pro. You never considered it. What do you know? See this ring? I bought it 5 years ago. You're kidding. Want to see the receipt? I always have it on me. I could never give it to you. Barcelona, Bali, Greece. Why didn't you? You never decide! "I don't know. Maybe." I thought you'd say no. Why would I have? It's Paul. See you soon? We need to talk. I'm interested in the relations among body, light and color. It's boring for a good cause. Congratulations. You're not invited. So don't come. It's my life now. I'm sorry. It was when I met my model that I found my style. There she is. - Can we talk? - This is... Now. Look at me. It's not you. It's artwork. Creations. Don't take it personally. How should I take it? Learn to compromise. Compromise? You beheaded me. I had no choice. We can always choose. Marie? I left Paul. Say it. Turn around. I love you. Do things really happen by chance? Life requires sacrifice... Where do we sit? ...but we can always choose. Wherever you want. That's nice. I'll sit here. I said you can choose. I understood. We can always choose. Never forget it. We can always choose. Can I sit down now? Like this, it's more modern. I can't. I'm interested in the relation among body, light... and color... It was when I met my model that I found my style. Here she is. So? It's beautiful. It's you. You were right not to crop them. Though you left me no choice. We can always choose. That's true. Marie? I left Paul. Say it. Turn around. I'm fine. Is that your husband? We have a show, you lovers! I parked it. The keys are inside. Will you marry me? I don't know. I can't decide. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack Subtitling: LVT - Paris
