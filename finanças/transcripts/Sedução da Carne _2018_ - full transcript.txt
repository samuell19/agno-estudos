My name is Siloé. In my life, imagination, music, poetry, dreams, they are all real. I have always lived unbridled, where souls wander aimlessly in a blatant darkness. I became a widow three years ago. My husband died suddenly during an excursion we would make to remote destinations, listening, seeing, old footpaths. Enchanted places. Light. Color. Music... The nocturnal songs of eastern birds. A world that brought me close to my wildest dreams. Day after day, night after night, the same delight, the same mystery. Death killed all the wonder. My husband died while we were at a beach. We were walking in the sand and foam of the waves, watching the birds, the fishermen, the horizon. To us, it was a new world... It was when, when I felt alone. I looked back and saw his fallen body at the edge of the water. I ran to him, he was dead. Dead, but seemingly on the verge of a new life... Destructive death... On a sunny day, with crystal waters and a calm sea, with pleasant temperatures… three years ago I became a widow. Sexual relations between man and beast have always existed, ever since animals became domesticated in caves. Domestication would include coitus, sexual intercourse. Someone in bloom, someone in doom, someone... The swan. A bird with strong symbolism, known for the sleekness of its feathers. A famous mythological tale tells us of how Jupiter transformed itself into a swan to seduce and win over Leda. From this union Pollux and Castor, and Helen and Clytemnestra were born. It is Apollo's sacred animal. Swans that pull Venus's carriage, attribute of muses. The Parrot. The symbolism of the parrot inspires different things: its curious and irresponsible way of speaking is symbolic of innocence and purity. But the parrot has a uniqueness: a hidden membrane from the human body, it is sensitive, enticed, attracted by the soft touch of its feathers that cascade along the body, smooth like silk, sweet like opium, perfect as they move between the lips and the small erect organ. The covered membrane, in a suave upward movement, it exposes itself, surging whole, with continuous affection. Strong pleasure, inebriating, narcotic... perfect as they move between the lips and the small erect organ. Strong pleasure, inebriating, narcotic, celestial, delightfully delicate and incomparably sweet... Humans are ordinary, ignorant and rude... You shall be the keeper of memories of old things. Parrot Humboldt. My father also liked old things. He was a brilliant and powerful inspiration. He was the one who chose my name, Siloé. Siloé was a fountain at the foot of Mount Zion. There they made a pool where Jesus Christ ordered a blind man to wash himself, he then put a mixture onto his eyes, made of a bit of mud and his own saliva. The miracle of the restored vision always made an impression upon my father. The writer João Ribeiro was remarkable. His scholarly exegesis on the aphorisms, proverbs, and short phrases found in our national Brazilian language teaches us to see, to read, to think. They are great and important books on the rhythmic and stylistic history of our literature. History that has not yet been written. João Ribeiro took a cadence, a cultured and philosophic language, he made a map of what had disappeared and saved it from oblivion. So much poetry, so many texts, so many verbal curiosities, a vigorous and modern writing, attuned to the archaic. João Ribeiro, remember this name. The Parrot first appeared on the map in 1519 when Brazil was known as the "Land of Parrots". The bird was unknown to the Europeans, a bird associated with Heaven on Earth, and a sign of all around wealth. Our names were: Holy Cross, Land of Parrots, True Cross, and in the end, violating sacrosanctity, we became known as Brazil. To be poised for disaster. The true meaning of poise is a state of balance or equilibrium; to be composed, dignified, and self-confident. But obviously one cannot maintain this idea of balance and dignity when a person is poised for disaster, that is, crumbling under pressure. There is, however, an essential difference between giving off a dignified appearance and standing at the brink of disaster. In the same vain, the Portuguese expression "em apuros" comes from the Latin "in puribus" and is found among old medical terms: in puribus meaning poor humours, reduced to pus. A headless mule. The headless mule is a common superstition and folklore. A priest's wife, after some years, becomes "the headless mule" and each night runs through seven parishes. The symbolic details of the superstition share distant roots with that of the witch. That she is a mule is essential, being a hybrid that can travel through many parishes in one night. That she is headless provides the meaning of "witch". Witches do not have heads, or they seem not to because they hide themselves within the hood of their cloak. The blood of animals, the silence of animals, the value of animals. We destroy this notion, we forget that the origin of animals is the origin of humans! Since ancient times our relationship with animals has been strategic. Humans learned from animals. Humans owe them. Humans have lost their souls. What people do to animals is the same they do to those who are different from them. The greed, the slaughtering, the daily, industrial, indiscriminate killing of millions of animals, it all reflects who we really are. ♪ Why so much ambition and vanity? ♪ In search of a lost star ♪ It's always the simple things in life ♪ That bring us happiness ♪ Happiness is a simple house ♪ With geranium flowers in the window ♪ A white knit hammock ♪ With the two of us dreaming in it ♪ Ai, ai, ai, it's so little, my love ♪ Ai, ai, ai, but it's enough for me ♪ Ai, ai, ai, it's so little, my love ♪ Ai, ai, ai, but it's enough for me. ♪
