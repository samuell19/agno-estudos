Salam aleikum. - Samuel! - Dude! You good? Get out. Am I interrupting? - Fuck off. - Got a light? - Go away, man. - No light? Fine. Have fun. - What? It's just Samuel. - Then fool around with Samuel. - Bye, Samu. - Bye, Lina. Dude, what was that? - Well, Lina's too hot for you. - Right. Figs in a German garden? Good plan. Sure, man. It'll grow like crazy. - Simsalabim. - Simsalabim yourself. You know where it comes from? Simsalabim? From my people. In the Middle Ages we were way ahead of you guys. - Real Muslims... - But you're baptized. Real Muslims say: "Bismillah rahman i rahim." "In the name of God," before any important act. Your people thought it was a spell and mimicked it. Bismillah: Simsalabim. You're a real Middle Ages expert. - Where do you get this shit? - Sesame Street, of course. "Abracadabra", means "amen." That comes from my people. You sure about this? You know how it ends! Okay, come on! Remember this position? STAMBUL GARDEN Dude! Hey there! - Hey! - Hi. - How nice! - Hey. Nice of you two to stop by. What's up? You need money? Isn't the school staff meeting today? Yes, but not all day. Samu, what's up? It's all good. You guys want some water? Yes, please. - How's Stambul? - Stambul's great. - All we do is learn. - Oh, so that's learning these days? I listened to that band you told me about. - I like them. - I thought you would. I listened to a few songs. The drummer's good. - He was really getting down. - I knew he would. Hey, Samu. Let's go. Oh, do you want to eat dinner with us? - Vegetable curry. - No, we're heading back out. - Take this. - Cool. - Then see you next year! - See you around. - See you. - Take care, boys. Dude, seriously? Wait there. I'll be right back. - Hey. - A visitor! - Hey. - Hi. - Janik! - Hi. - Hey. Is Samy here too? - Yeah, he's in there. Samy! Hey, big guy. It's good to see you! - Nice to see you. How are you? - Good. - Mom, the key was in the door again. - So? Come see Nobbe and Harry. - Look who's here! - Hey, big guy! - You grew! - He's a beanpole! Say hello. Who taught you your manners? - Hello. - Hey. - Hey, big guy. - Hey. - Sit. - We're heading off. Sit down for a second. Please! For your mom. - How are you guys? - Great. - Final exams? - They're going okay, right? Make something of yourselves because we didn't. - Have a coffee, treat yourself! - Thanks. - Hey, Janik... - Janik, how are your parents? - Good. - Yeah? Tell them thanks for... They're real lifesavers. - Mom, we have to study. - No, let's make music! Yes! Samy, Samy, Samy! Just real quick! A little music! You guys ready? Time for Irene! Oh, Irene, you break my heart every time! You guys ready? You blow my mind! I don't want to change Just to impress you Or talk about problems The whole night through But I'll give you a clue All I want is you! Samy! Dance with your mom! Please! Man, don't be a drag! I won't make promises That I cannot keep It's you I want to be with Right now and not next week And you know it's true All I want is you - Janik! - Everybody! I won't fall asleep tonight without you I won't go home tonight without you I won't find peace tonight without you All I want is you I won't go home tonight without you... Look at her back then. Daddy, Mommy, baby. Family portrait. Hey, where you going? To piss. Am I allowed? - Help me, you jerk. - I have to learn this by heart. What does Lina see in you, wimp? Who knows? Maybe my straight A's? My final exam scores? Straight A's are dope, but I want to do something real. Honest work. And nobody's really pushing me to study. Tell that to my parents. "Your potential, Samuel... You can't let it go to waste!" You can paint boats and I'll be a guide. Istanbul must be full of museums. You know nothing about Turkish culture. And you're an Ottoman, or what? Sure I am. Listen up. Repeat after me: Sik-tir-lan (Fuck off). - Sik-tir-lan. - Sik-tir-lan. Siktir lan, dude. Yeah, Siktir lan for real. Look. - What's that? - Turkish cigarettes. - They must be my father's. - Osman? Then they're 20 years old. Careful. - They taste like it, too. - Yeah, I found them in this old vase. But hey, now we know his name is Osman, and he's a smoker. - That really narrows it down. - Yeah. Dude! Go fuck yourself! - Is anything growing? - Well, a fig tree won't. That's what I said. So when can we have Stambul fruit salad? - Soon. You just have to believe. - Wishful thinking. Speaking of which... have you decided what you'll study when you're back? Or maybe take a voluntary social year first? Or not study at all. Maybe we'll do something real. Honest work. Okay... And teaching isn't real? I thought about joining the army. - If you say so. - Seriously. - It's the best study program in Germany. - What would you study there? - Engineering. - Now that's real. You can do that without giving the army 12 years of your life. What's so bad about the army? I mean, structure, discipline, comradery. They're good things. Your livelihood is guaranteed and you can give back to your country. - What do you want to give back? - The state supports us where it can. For example? Okay, maybe it doesn't support you guys. Well, without our social programs, my mom would live under a bridge. There must be other ways to give back to the state, right? Fine, if you feel the need to march into foreign lands with guns, go for it. You'll make the right decision. Janik, not inside. If you have to smoke, at least do it outside. - Speaking of discipline in the army! - Let it go now. - Every single time... - Just leave it now. Hey. Hey. Happy birthday, jerk. A travel guide. You're such a Kraut. But thanks, it was a nice thought. - Chaka-boom! - Hey, bro! Hey, Leroy, big guy. You keep getting taller, too, right? Hey, photo session number 1! Steffi, come here. - Cool party, man. - Thanks. I'll be right back. Try the quinoa salad, Samuel made it. Mom, please don't. - I baked you a cake. - You're embarrassing me. I haven't seen you all day. Come here. Happy birthday. - Hey, Janik. - Irene, you joining us? - No. - Yes. - No! - I'll leave before the birthday games. - Behave yourself. - Always. Relax, man. Party a little. You were in such a good mood! Thanks! - By the way, I'm Irene, Samuel's mom. - Really? There's definitely no hash in it. - Can we get some too? - Sure. - Hey, birthday boy. - Hey. Just give that to Janik. He's inside. - Want some? - No, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - There's lots of people here. - Yeah. - You guys hang here? - Yeah, have a look around. - Really? - Sure. - It's nice here. - Yeah. Crazy. I'd better get back. Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! - Anybody else want a beer? - Yes! Hey, bro! You good? Irene? Irene! Hello? Irene! Fuck! - Shit! - She's real messed up. - Go back outside! - She's fucked! Mom? Hey! Mom! - Should I call a doctor? - Keep the party going! - Mom, come here. - Samu! Samu! Get me a bucket! Mom, hey! Hey! - Here. - Come here. - Come here, Mom. - Samy. I'm sorry. Sorry. Janik, keep the party going. I'll be right back. - What happened? - Just keep your mouth shut. - Hey, cheers! To me! - Cheers! Confetti! Knock it off. - Where were you, man? - Taking a dump. You should go somewhere else. There are so many other cool countries. But Samuel's dad happens to be Turkish. That's what his mom says, anyway. He doesn't know what he looks like or what his name is. - Osman. - Osman what? You really think you'll find something out about him? Of course not. You've known about this since we met. Why are you trying to talk me out of it? I thought we could travel together before I start university. The stupid school trip, or what? No, just the two of us, camping somewhere. Sure, Lina. - Really? - Yes. - Promise? - Yes. Shit. What now? Nothing, she wants to travel with me. - You pulling out? - No way. - Lina's great, but I'm not in it for life. - Maybe you should tell her that? When I decide on a woman, it'll be marriage and forever. The one true love, or what? No, our plan says nobody gets between us, especially not a girl. Yeah, man. - What did you do with Irene yesterday? - Took her away. Where to? Home. And then? Nothing. I gave her a cold shower, and put her to bed. It was my birthday, man. Think I'd let her ruin it? - It's finally over! - Yeah! Janik, come here. Lina! - What's up? - Just a sec. - Take that shit off. - Chill. - You put one on! - No way! - I have something for us. - Nice, bro. - Seriously? - Don't be a buzzkill, Lina. - I got one for you, too. - Let's celebrate. In half an hour at the latest, I'll be chasing you guys like a third wheel. - But we're a three-wheeler, right? - As usual! Because it works so well... - Come on, please. - Janik. Please. - Grow up, boys. - Hey, Lina! Yolun aççk olsun, Lina. - What? - "May your journey flow like a river." - You can be such an asshole. - Come on, it'll be dope. Hey, buddy! Janik! Irene, hey! You good? What are you doing here? Exams! We're graduating! Oh yeah. Congrats. So you guys will be gone soon, eh? But we haven't gone yet. Where is Samy? Where'd he go? What's up with you? You nut! What's up with you, huh? Hey, little guy! Calm down. Shh! Maybe we should hide or something. I'm too old for this shit. You're not old at all. You're still really young. And really beautiful. Really. Samu! Hey, Samu! Wait! Samu, wait! Wait, Samu! Hey, Samu. Wait. Samu, are you here? Samu? - Here comes the coffee express! - Oh, yummy. - Hey! There you are. - Good morning. - Rough night? - Looks like you really lived it up. - Was Samu here? - No. Everything okay? How was the rest of your night? Fun, and yours? Mine too. Come on, I don't want to. Janik, that's not how it works. What's wrong? Something's up. I think we should stop seeing each other. Sorry? You're joking, right? So what the fuck was that just now? One last fuck before you leave me? I'm sorry. Excuse me. Janik, you're such an asshole. Just fuck off! Go! Samu. Go home and pack. We're leaving all this shit behind us. Don't forget your passport. That way, I think. That's it: "Izmir." Oh, I thought it was "Istanbul." Hey, that must be him, right? Hello. Hello. Passport. - There you go. - Thanks. Boys, the toilet and sink are down the hallway. If you need anything, I'm at reception. Have a nice stay. Thank good. "Thank good"? - This is dope. - It's good, right? Yeah, man. You did good. Are you insane, bro? Hey, Samu! - It's pretty dope. - Yeah, super yummy. I don't mean the food, I mean us. - I didn't think we'd pull it off. - Why not? That was the plan, right? Definitely. Muhakkak. What? Muhakkak. It means "definitely." Dope. - Did you pack swim trunks? - Swim trunks? - That's way too dirty to swim in. - The travel guide says the Turks do it. It also says that you Krauts should lash on the sun cream. I can see you already: all sunburned, Bermuda shorts, sandals and socks. Socks and sandals? Muhakkak, man! Dude! Watch out. - It's full of sharks. - Really? We should totally go diving. Come on! Come on! Come on! Oh, why! Oh, that hurts! Come on, you! Come on! And you! Oh, that hurts! Oh, how lovely is your hair! I can't wait till tomorrow, Osman Aga I don't believe a word you say, Oh, how lovely is your hair! Oh, how lovely is your hair! I can't wait till tomorrow, Osman Aga I don't believe a word you say, Osman Aga Come on people, give us some cash! The boy's already got callouses on his fingers! Come on, you misers! I'll show you around, no problem. Cool. My name is Samuel and this is Janik. - Samuel, Janik. - Right. - This is Fiko. - I'm Fiko. He's not so important. This is Kamil. - And Sercan. Show him your hands. - Golden hands. - Calloused. I am Osman. - Osman? Hey, we found him! That was easy. We would like to find... work. Seriously? No problem. - He might get us a job. - What kind of job? One that makes us money. - You wanted to work in a museum. - But we have money for three months. - Exactly. We need money. - How long do you want to stay? - See you later! - Get the guys a job! We're going to see my cousin, Seko. He'll get you a job. - Work? - Yes, he'll find you something. Great. What are you saying? I don't understand a thing. We planned this ages ago. You could've learned Turkish. - But I have you. - Hey, brother! - Seko, you good? - I'm great. You? - What's up? - You good? I'm good. - Yeah, I'm good. - Nice. - Who did you bring? - Our brothers Samuel and Janik. - They're looking for work. - What kind of work? - Clean work. - If there was clean work, I'd do it. You like it? Give it a swing. - Look. Swing it like this. - Tell him he'll get a show. He's a showman. Look. - Tell him 20 lira. - That's too much. 10 lira. - Gimme money. - Gimme money! Nice, fresh money! Nice! I like you! Give me five! Thanks! - May I? - You crook! Every time! Give it to us. Give, give, give! Give it to us! Give, give, give! Quality, quality! Brand name, brand name! Pump it up! Pump, pump, pump! Spread the lotion! Spread, spread, spread! - Welcome to Istanbul! - Cheers! Come on, eat up. Eat. Best food. Eat. - What is this? - Liver. They all eat it here. - Okay. - What do they want in Istanbul? Why are you in Istanbul for so long? Yes, he's Turkish. - Really? He says his dad's Turkish. - And I'm the Queen of England! - Osman's got something dope for us. - What? Osman? Minibus? - I've got a minibus for you. - Minibus? Yeah, it's cool. Then we'd have our own space again. - Hostels are for tourists, anyway. - We are tourists. Janik, it's not important. Never heard of jail, boy? - Since when do you speak English? - Don't worry. Dig in. He's digging in! Dig in! Dig, dig, dig! I've got a sunburn! - Of course you do, Kraut! - Ouch, man! Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you: What if she's pregnant? Does that mean I can call you Dad? Do it. I don't feel like it. Just chill, man. It's not all politics. - Hello, Janik? - Happy birthday, Dad. - From the half-Turkish kid too. - ...That means "happy birthday." - Nice of you guys to call. - Sure, it's your birthday. - You doing something nice? - Just a little DIY. And you guys? How are you? How's the mood in the city? Good. Everyone's super nice. It's cool. Good. Don't get into any political discussions. - We won't, don't worry. - Let me talk to him. - I can't talk long. - Ella wants to talk to you. - Janik, hey! How are you? - Great. We're good. Good. Um, something weird happened. Irene was here. - Really? What did she want? - She wanted to see your room. - My room? - Yes, it's Samuel's room too, somehow. She also asked where you two are and when you'll be back. - Didn't Samuel tell her? - I think he did. But she looked really good and she wants to do therapy. Maybe because Samu is gone. Maybe that sparked something. - Maybe. - Give him the phone. - No, maybe another time. Bye. - Okay, bye... What's wrong? Why didn't you tell Irene when we'll be back? Why? She showed up at my parents' yesterday. Don't you worry about her, with you gone. - Is that your business? - Just asking. Don't ask shit like that. She's going into therapy, Samu. Good for her. Samu, 200,000 kilometers, no problem. Good car. Okay. It's dope, right? What do you say? - It's nice, but should we really buy it? - Take a look. 3,000 isn't much for a ride like this. We'd save money on hostels. But all our money would be gone. We can borrow from your parents. - No, we're not hitting up my parents. - They've got the money. Yes, but we wanted to be independent, remember? - Nice? - Yes. - Look how big it is. - You could live in there. - Sure. - What did he say? They want to discuss it. - Samy, tea? - Yes. Fucking money! - We'll find a better bus, a cheaper one. - Even cheaper? - It can't be a piece of junk. - Let's rethink it all a bit. "Rethink it all"? You want to go back? I think you pretend not to care how she is. If anything's not your business, it's my mother. You know every fucking detail about my family. Now you even want their money, but your holy, hobo mom is off limits. What? You've seen everything, haven't you? Now you're complaining, asshole? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm just in a bad mood. Hey, Samu. Wait a second. - Fuck, Samu! I'm sorry! - Stop! Keep your hands to yourself! - I'm sure it can be fixed. - You destroy everything. You said yourself: we'd leave all that shit behind us. I know I fucked up big time, but we can't let it get between us. - Maybe she's turned a corner and... - Shut up! Who do you think you are? You stuck your dick in her and bam! She's healed? I won't give this up because she says she'll change! - Fuck you! - Man... I can't change it now, okay? But we can decide how we deal with it! If we let it break us or if we... conquer it. You're a conqueror, eh? A knight with a lance and everything! Then go back to Mommy. I'm doing this, with or without you. Janik? Samu? Oh shit, you okay? No, I feel like shit. Maybe it was that liver? Where were you yesterday? I called a thousand times. Give me that. Should I get you tea or bread or something? Sick? - Go fetch some cookies and cola. Hurry. - Okay, boss. They must've had a wild night. Hurry. Take this, too. For your friend. Samu, take this. What is it? You have a fever. Just take it. Here. Careful. Sit up. I've got you. Samu, you're covered in sweat. Put your arms up. Hello! Welcome! My camera... I broke it. Broke it? It fell on the ground. Ah, you dropped it... Let's see. Do you think you can fix it? I don't know. - Where are you from? - Germany. Germany! Deuchland! Print! One day... One day after... - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow, come. - Then you will maybe... - Maybe, I don't know. Come! No, sorry, I... What is that? No, sorry. Thank you. We'll put you right, Samu. We'll put you right. Tea? - Hey. - Hello. Hey, you're alive again! That was fucking heavy, man. You got it fixed? I got the film developed too. You hungry? I ate already. Okay... Osman. We're gonna hang with Seko. You were out of it for days. Exactly. I have to get out of this place. Come on. Take care of the stall, Samu. - Hello. - Hello. - Tobacco. - Tobacco's underneath. - How much? - Ten lira. Here you go. Bye. Thanks. - Nice job! - Not bad, Samu. - You've got it. - He's got it. - Boss. - Keep it. It's yours. Thanks. Hey, is something up? I think I'll split. Why? Grab yourself a beer. - See ya. - Call me, okay? - Come here. Come. - Thanks. - May God protect you. - Take care. I think it's this way. I don't think so. It's a dead end. Let's go back. Hang on, I need to pee. Come here. - What are you doing? Just taking a piss? - Sorry. - What's wrong with you? - Sorry. Please... You can't just piss there. - Shall I piss in your face? - Hey, Samu! Come on! Man. Dude, what the hell? You were right. Let's buy the bus. That's a turnaround. It won't kill me to ask my parents. Yeah, bro. What did I say? - Janik? - Hey, Ella. It's me. Lovely! How are you two? We miss you. Everything's cool. What a coincidence. Guess who's here? Here. Janik. Where are you boys? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hi, Ella? Samuel... It's your mom... You said to call. We'll buy that fucking bus. We'll just negotiate. We're buying that fucking bus. - I just want to help the boys. - Shall I adopt them too? Make a better offer or I'll smack you with the car jack. You own four apartments, man. Quit being so stingy. Screw you! You after my apartments? Take it or fuck off! You son of a bitch. 2,500, final offer. May your mother-in-law snuff it. I wish! Think we bumped into Osman somewhere? My father, I mean. Maybe he crossed our path somewhere. Or we just drove past him without noticing. Don't you think? What are you doing here? - They're tourists, right? - Yeah. What are you doing here? And half-naked too. What are you doing? Stop! - Papers, passports. - License, passport. Samuel. - Give me mine. - Janik. License! Janik, come! Let me check that. Stop. Wait there! Janik, come! Come, quick! Go on. Samuel. Come. Here. The dope. Quick! Open the boot! Please, please... Sorry. Ticket! No, sorry! Forbidden! Please... 250 Euro. - Go! - Thank you! - No-parking zone. - You can't park a car here. - What are you doing? - Go on. - Start the car, man! - I am! - What are you doing? - Starting the car! - Start the car! - What do you think I'm doing, dude? Stop! You guys crashed here last night? - Yes. - Yeah. Oh, crap. The boys are tourists. Be more careful. Sure. Have a good day! - This is an exception, okay? - Of course. Thank you. Have a nice day! There you go. And here's yours. You losers... Come on, let's go. Fiko will pay for this. - Fiko? - Yes, Fiko. He's fucked now. Do this, go on! He's not answering. Nothing we can do. Let's do it like that then... Okay. - Give me two days. We'll sort it out. - No problem. I called Memo, but he won't fucking pick up! Janik, shut it. And you believe him. Fuck you! I'll bury you here. I'll kill you... Fuck you! Annoying little fuck! - Let me go! - What the fuck, man? The guy's an asshole. - How did you manage it? - Manage what? How did you fuck the bus up like that? Are you for real? It would've happened to you, too. That shit only seems to happen to you. No matter what you touch. - You know our cash is gone, right? - Yes! The money for the return flights is enough for a week. That's enough time to find some crappy job. I know how to get cash. We'll just sell Stambul. You must be kidding. What's the use of a garden in Germany? We're here now. - It's our home, man. - You still don't get it, do you? I'm not going back. I belong here now. Here? You don't belong here at all! - You're as much of a Kraut as I am. - Fuck you, dude! You're jealous because I found my place. You'd be lost without me! You'd be on the school trip with the other losers! It would've been nicer than joining your ego trip. Your city, your Osman, your plan. And now your Stambul? - You don't give a damn what I want. - What do you want? Exactly. You keep acting like you've found your home and your roots! You run around taking photos of some ghost. You're kidding yourself. Your plan sucks! You got a better idea? You always loved my plans till now. Latched onto me and my mom to put some drama in your shitty life. You're not a fucking Turk. You don't even look like one. Wake up! Your dad could come from anywhere. Your mom just screwed some guy 20 years ago. Stop! Go fuck yourself then! "May your fucking journey flow like a river!" Hey? Fuck... are you really taking off? So that's it? Just like that? Here you go. Thank you. Sorry for what I said yesterday. - Why? For being honest at last? - I shouldn't have said it. Say what you think, not what I want to hear. You should stay. It'll be a while till you get a cheap flight, anyway. HOME Fuck. They can't help themselves. - They called me a million times too. - I'll answer. - Hello? - Janik? We've been calling you for days! Samuel isn't answering either. - What's up? - I don't know how to say it... Irene... Janik? Irene had a relapse. She was home alone. She fell and... hit her head on the radiator. Give it back to me. She choked on her vomit. Janik... Irene is dead. Janik, are you still there? Janik? What's up? What did they want? What's the fucking face for? Irene... What if it all happened because... - If I hadn't... - Stop. It's got nothing to do with you. Or with me. Let's get the next plane back. - We have to... - No. It's over now. I'm not going back. And Mom is dead. I can't stay here, Samu. That's enough, Samu. Let's go. Are there any more boxes? In the hall. You'll have to fold them, I think. - I'll go get the car. - Thanks.
