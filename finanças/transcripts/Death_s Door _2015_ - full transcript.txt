So did I. - What did yours say? - The same thing. - Do you know who it's from? - No, I don't. - What should we do? We might not even know this person. - Think about it. Whoever sent it knows you and they know me. Anybody who's got that description's gotta be cool, right? - That's true but I don't know. - Yeah, but I know and that's all you need to know, sister. - It's just a text.

Let's have some fun. (upbeat lively music) (knocking on the door) (upbeat lively music) (screaming) - Who the hell was that? - I don't know. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Let's get the fuck outta here. (upbeat lively music) - What the hell is this? - What's wrong with you? - That's what I'm talking about. (mumbles) - Let me get a little of that. I don't see any (mumbles) real soon, I'm gonna get the hell outta here. - All right. - Hey, that's mine. - I got this. - But you got it late. - Oh it's like that? - Yeah, it's like that. - In that case... - Look at this motherfucker. - It's all yours. - I don't think that was the smartest thing you could've did right now. - I really put a lot of thought. - Oh really? - Yeah. (water pouring) - Yeah, take that right. Oh nice. Smell that. What do you think about that? - I think we should take it outside. - I think we should, too. Ladies first. - Something's happening over here. Come one, come on, come on. - Let's go. - Where are you going? - There's a fight. - Yeah, you made a big mistake, boy. - I heard the story. Let's see the picture. - Can we just forget about these, guys? Come on. - Go ahead. - Come on. They're not gonna fight. - Sissy. - What? You scared? - That's what I thought. - It won't open. (laughs) (spooky music) - Something's not right. - Whoa Alexis! Save some for Godzilla. (laughs) - Hey, did you hear that the front door is jammed? That it won't open? - As in we'll never get out. - I'm not the only one who is saying that. - Listen, if you go around repeating stupid shit like that you might actually have to take the credit for it, okay? - All I'm saying is, you know what? Never mind. - Back off, Alexis. Think about it. I came in through it, we just saw a couple come in through it. There's something I want to do. - Didn't he come with her? - What if he did? When are you gonna learn? It's not who you come to the party with that counts in this game, right? - But she seems really nice. - And he seems even nicer. Oh my God. - Suzanne, don't! Wait. - What is her problem? - She always so sick and bullshit. She saw you and... (screaming) (spooky music) - Thanks. I never screamed like that before in my life. - I got this. I like to crack things open. Come on! - I'm counting to three. One, two, three. Fuck! (laughs) - I think this one's open. - Yeah, let's go that way. - Wacko! Oh man. Eh, where you going? It's time to reload. - Come on man, what are you doing? - Whine, women's song. Who's complaining? - What are you talking about? - Rick, Rick, come on, man. Look, there are four types of people in this world: those who panic in a crisis, those who analyze a crisis and do nothing, and those that exploit all the others. - Wait, that's three, man. - You prove my point. You're in the second category. - Don't you wanna get out of this place? - And turn my back on a jackpot? What? Women who needs security from a physical threat that's what I call some serious ass crack. - You're not even a little creeped out just a little? - Yeah, I'm scared I might leave without a handful of ass. I won't have to worry about anything else. (screaming) - Oh my God. It's a fucking dead man. - What the hell. - What kind of crazy shit is that, man? - Why would anyone do that? - Bring a dead man in a fucking house. - Watch your mouth. - Who the hell would do something like that? - It's not real, right? - Of course it's not. - What? - Man, I know what this is. This is one of those murder mystery parties. You know the (making spooky sounds). - Are you fucking nuts or what? - It's not real, right? - It can't be. It doesn't have a smell or anything. (laughing) (spooky music) - Guys, please we have to try to find a signal. (screaming) (laughing) - Fuck! Fuck! Oh my God! - What the fuck! - That's a good idea. Babe, where's your phone? - I left it in the car charging. - Hold on, hold on, wait, wait. (no phone signal beep) Fuck! Fuck! No signal. I can't get a signal. - All right, eliminate the obvious. Like we're looking for something lost. - That's brilliant. - Really? What ideas did you come up with, huh? - Shut up! - Stupid! - I hear something. - It sounds like it's coming from the bedroom. (door closing shut) (screams) Wait, wait, wait, wait. Take your time. Come on. - I'm sick of this fucking, fucking, fucking whole place. I'm getting sick of this fucking shit, no good God damn piece of shit! - Let's not give up yet. (spooky music) - You're hurting my hand. - I'm not holding your hand. - Alexis? Alexis? Kendra? (spooky music) (screaming) - You tried this one? - Yeah. - This house is crazy. - Oh okay, don't listen to the guy with the glasses. I mean I've only tried it a hundred times, Goldilocks. - What's wrong with this house? - I don't know. I'll figure it out. - What's wrong with this house, Dean? - I promise. (sobbing) Do you hear me? Do you hear me? I'll figure it out if it kills me. - Everyone hurry up! We're outta here. - Thank God. - Let's go, honey. - Ha-ha-ha. Just like I said, the man did what he said he would do. - What a fucking relief. - Thank you, Lord Jesus Christ. - I'll take that as a compliment. - You take everything as a compliment. - Yo, Rick, didn't I tell you to go get a beer out in the kitchen on your way back? - Are you kidding me, man? I'm trying to get the hell out of here. - I have to do everything. Damn! (door closing shut) - Oh no! - Who did that? - What's wrong? Something isn't working here. - Come on, baby. Let a man do it. It opened up once. - That's what she said. - I'd put my hand on it just to get it wide. Abracadabra! Let this be! (door creaking open) (screaming) (spooky music) (door closing shut) - She's make-believe. - Do something with her, man! - Dude, be cool, man. Be cool. - That's some shit! - I can't get a signal! - Kendra. - Oh God, I never had this problem before. - Look at me! (slapping) (sobbing) (clock ticking) (knock on the door) (clock ticking) (spooky music) (clock ticking) (knock on the door) (sobbing) - Suzanne. Suzanne. - Did you hear that? - Suzanne. (spooky music) - Shit! (spooky music) (knock on the door) (knock on the door) (spooky music) (beating drums) (blade cutting through) (screaming) - Gary, what the hell are you doing? - What? What's going on? - What the hell are you doing in here? - I followed a sound. I came across this. - I'll be damned. - What kind of sound? - Who cares? Just get to what happened. - I don't know. I put my head in there and then, something's different ...the blade. The blade's back where it was. - Why would you put your head in there? - Have you always been scared of magic? - You stop and tell us what happened. - Bruce, don't. - What? What do you think is gonna happen? - That's the same thing I did right before I saw the skull. - What skull? - Guys, it's a prop. It goes way back. Look, it works when the two blades come down around you. The middle part doesn't move so you don't lose your head. - Look, I don't care how it works or how it doesn't work. I just wanna get the hell outta here. - There's something wrong about it. - What are you excited for? - Just don't do it. - What do you think is gonna happen? - I'm just saying that's all. - Move your hands. Why you spazzed out? - Just leave him alone, man. - I mean what, man? I mean did it hit him? It's just a trick for crying out loud. - I'm warning you, don't. - Let's be on the safe side. - You know what, go ahead. Let's see what happens. - I mean, how do you know, man? - Because he doesn't have earwax spread all over the damn floor. You know what, man? You guys are straight up punks. This is ridiculous. (laughing) (spooky music) (phone beep) - Okay guys, I for one, have had enough. - Yeah, I know. You're not used to that much excitement. What the hell, man! Who spilled on this? - What's that, man? It's freaking blood on your shirt, man. - That's coming from, please no, no, no. - I can't. Please, somebody else. - Don't look at me. - See, I knew it. I knew it, I knew it. Ain't nothing but some pet tricks or something. This can't be right. Look. See, man, I told you. This is probably like animal blood or something. - Like whatever it is I'm not going there. - What do you think it is? - All I know is that it's a mess. Holy shit! Where the hell did that come from? - Please God, don't let her be, don't. - It can't be. Don't tell me someone who murdered someone dragged the body in here and then, I mean there wouldn't be time. - I didn't hear anything. - You see this felt? This dates back to the Renaissance when the new teachings of everlasting life brought with it the fear of being buried alive and this design was there to reassure people. - What about Kendra? Where the hell is she? - Wait, wait, wait. The blood stops over here and the only other blood is coming from... - My footsteps? I'm the one who first came in the room. - Yeah, but when was the first time you were over there? - Wait a minute. What are you trying to say to me? - I think you already know. You could've moved over there and just matched steps. - Man, don't even try it. - Matched steps, isn't that a motherfucking bitch? - I'm not accusing you of anything. - Yeah, that's what they say until they got you strung up. - Hey, man, don't be ridiculous, man. - And then it's all we knew who did all along. - My friend is dead. Don't you assholes understand that? - Are you guys gonna do anything about my friend? - Yeah, somebody just do something. - Will you help me? - Just don't try to make me the fall guy. - There goes the mouth and here comes the tears. Get the hell... - No, Bruce, Bruce, Bruce stop! (punched and knocked out) (knocking) - Did you hear that? - Of course. We all heard that, man. So what? - He's not moving. - Get the hell outta there. Stop messing around. - He's really still. - It was an accident. I wasn't even aiming at him. - Rick. Rick! (bell ringing) (screaming) - What happened? - She is in here. She is here. Help me get her out! (bell ringing) - Wait! - You wait! - How do you even know she's in there? - Whoever it is, we gotta do something. - Hey look, look guys it's a prank, I'm telling you. - Kendra! - In the kitchen. Come on, this way. - We've got to hurry. - Just don't panic. - Can you hear me? - What about this, man? - What am I gonna do with that? Stab the coffin until it opens? - I'm just trying, man. - Well, then stop and think for once. - Where are you going? Come back! - I can't take it anymore. I can't do this anymore. - Come back. We need you, Alexis. - I can't do this. - Oh God. Oh please. - Come on, come on, come on. Everybody, back up, back up! Get it in, get it in, man. - I'm trying, man. - Put your back into it. - What's going on? We came from upstairs. Is everything okay? - What the hell is this doing here? - That's actually what we wanna know. - Kendra's missing. She might be in there. - What's everybody standing around for? Come one, let's get this open. Come on! - She could be bleeding to death. - Everybody lift your arms. - Fuck! It's heavy! - Fuck! - God damn! - Jesus! - What happened? - It's not real idiots. - Somebody please, what is it? (coffin closed shut) (screaming) (spooky music) - What happened? - I was asleep. I don't know. - See, I told you it was a gag. I told you! - Who put you in there? - Do you remember anything? - It's a dream. - It was magic. That's all it was. - What dream? Go on. - I remember lying on the couch when I felt this shadow and so I opened my eyes and I remember thinking, "That's a really strange thing to do in a dream." But I opened my eyes and I saw this black man standing there and he was looking straight at me. But it wasn't like he was staring. His eyes just never moved. - Was that it? - No. He looked at me with those dead eyes. That's what they were. They were open but they were not alive. Oh God, and then I saw him lift his hand and there was something in it. (sobbing) It was a blade. (sobbing) It was a gigantic blade and it kept hitting me, and hitting me, and hitting me with it. I tried to scream. I tried. But I couldn't make a sound. I couldn't. Nobody could hear me. Nobody came. And that's when I woke up and I saw all of you there. (laughing) - You should've seen you guys' face. It was priceless. (footsteps heading upstairs) - His girlfriend's up there. Why don't you guys go with him? - What for? Nobody's been hurt. - Not yet. (screaming) Oh my God! (bell ringing) - How do we get out of here? (choking) - My greatest trick of all time will be no trick at all. But a feat to cheat death itself out of its unyielding power, to steal... ...time for all time from all my enemies. (haunting music) (footsteps) (screaming) I am going to need a subject. And you will be my subject. (gasping) - What is it? What happened? What? - I did a terrible thing. - What? - I didn't mean to. I just, I got carried away. - Has something's happened? - No. Everything's all right. - Why did you frighten me? - I just gave myself a little scare that's all. - Where did you go? - I just left you for a little while. - Who's that Suzanne girl? - I promise, I promise never, never to do that again. - I wanna go. - Okay, let's go downstairs. - No, I wanna leave here. - Okay. - You mean it? - I swear to you. I swear to you, to God, and to whoever else that is listening. I promise I would do whatever it takes to get us outta here. Okay, let's get out of here. - Wait for me? I've gotta go to the bathroom. (no phone signal beep) - Is everything okay? What's going on here? - What? - We heard fighting. - No one knows what time it is. Everyone thinks it's something different. - Look, man, I'm not saying I'm right. - No, you just said I was wrong. - No, man, all I'm saying if no one can agree then there's no way to freakin' know, man. Come on. - Well, I got 4:15. - AM or PM? - Someone has to know. - What time is it? - Time for me to get the hell outta here. - It's like time doesn't exist here. - This is ridiculous. We have not been here more than five hours. Trust me, I would know. - Man, look at the time. - Man, I don't care. Everybody's got something different. I don't give a damn if it's 10 to shit. It doesn't mean we've been here longer than we have. - But how do you know? - Because it's a trick. - It could be. - That's what I've been trying to tell these damn fools. - Hey, man, don't call me that. - Shut up, twit. - What about my friend? Hey, I'm not going anywhere without her. (spooky music) (hammering) - Oh fuck! - Shit! God damn it! - What the fuck do they want from us? - They just wanna fuck with us! - This is getting freaking crazier and crazier! - No, you guys are getting crazier and crazier. - Look, man, this isn't just a freaking joke, all right? I don't know why but for some freaking reason someone must have heard us. (hammering and screaming) - I can't understand why all of this is happening. - Who says there has to be a reason? - There's explanation for everything. - There's a lot of things that don't make any sense. - There's gotta be an explanation. - Like what? - What if there is a reason for all of this? - Why would anybody want to do this to us? Why? - Kendra, are your ears ringing? 'Cause I don't recall you covering your ears. - I didn't? - No, you didn't. - Well, everything was so loud. I don't remember if I did. - This, this is some crazy shit. - Yeah, but how do we figure it out? - Not by arguing like a bunch of bitches! (sobbing) - What do we do? How can we fight? (haunting music) - Oh shit! Look at all this stuff. - I see it. It looks like junk. - It's all stuff to do with magic. - It looks like it hasn't been used forever. (knock on the door) - Oh God! (screaming) - I told you I'd be back. Now look, I was gonna tell you this earlier but I really don't wanna say nothing but I wasn't actually going here looking for a brick. I was actually looking for something that would show us another door would open. Good place to hide something, right? - Yeah, I do have something to hide it all. - Let me see. Reach and see. Maybe we could find something. Okay, I feel like loose... (screaming) - Oh God, no. Oh my God, no. - I'm just kidding. - You were a fucking jerk! - All right, all right. Hey, but I did find something. I did find something. - What do you see? - It looks like it's the deed to this house. And that one looks... - Be careful. - like a family tree or something. What does the deed have to do with this house? I mean, maybe it has an inheritance or something. (spooky music) - Maybe we shouldn't be doing this. This is all private stuff. - It seems like somebody was a collector, or really into magic. (haunting music) - I don't wanna do this anymore, Theo. - You have to do this. We've already committed to make this happen. - No, I'm scared of him. - This is... - You should be scared of him, too. - He can't hurt us. - Yes, he can. You have no idea what he's capable of. - You put me up to this. (clapping and laughing) - Man, why people collect the weirdest shit? - Marc, you're white. (metal noise) - Sorry. - Oh shit. - Magic storage. You put your shit in, watch your money disappear. - Well, it looks like this place once belonged to a magician and his wife, until the magician met with a bizarre demise. - A woman. How could he go on with such a thing like that. (screaming) - Oh my God! Get a hold of me, please. Get a hold of me. (laughing) - Stop it. I'm trying to help you. - Yeah, this explains a lot. - It doesn't explain what the fuck I'm doing here. - All right. What about that demise? - I don't know. I haven't read that part yet. - I think I might have figured it out. - Now, he leaves the door open for doubt. - You're an asshole. (screaming) - Alexis! Alexis! - Shit! (spooky music) What is it? - Alexis? Oh God, Alexis, please. Are you okay? - Jesus. - What the fuck happened here? - Jesus don't. (spooky music) - Oh no. - Oh my God. - It couldn't be. - That's somebody's legs. - No, it's not. - Then what are they then? - What side are you on? - What do you mean what side? - You know what man, I thought you was the level one not any dumbass bunch in here. - That's a goddamn leg, man. - It's not. - It is. - No, I'm telling you. - What the fuck does it look like to you? - I don't give a fuck what it looks like. It's not what it fucking is. - Bullshit! - Fuck that! Don't tell me. I know what I see. - Are you blind, man? Open your eyes. Don't you get it? - I know a bitch leg when I see one. - God, will you just shut up, man? God, I've never been around such dickheads in my life. How do you suppose to be taking care of anyone? - You better shut the fuck up. - It's not real. None of this is real. - How do you know? - Are any of us dead? - She might still be alive. - And who legs could that be? - All I know is someone's walking around (mumbles). - That's sounds smart, idiot. - You know what? Prove it. You're so fucking smart. Prove it. - Yeah, you know what? Put your game to the test. - Listen, man, it's make-believe. None of this shit is real, man. - Prove it. - Yeah, prove it, man. If you think they're fake then pick 'em up. - Okay. Would I do this? - Oh God. No. - It's heavy. - Take a bite out of it. - Okay. - Oh God, no! - I told you, man. - It doesn't prove anything. - This is not happening. - No. - It's not happening. - I'm convinced. - Yeah, and I'm convinced you're still suckers. - Shut up! Shut up for one second in your freaking life, man. - I'm gonna forget that you said that. - Don't forget it! - What? - Just look around you, man. Face the freakin' facts. Admit it! - You're wilin' out right now. - Look, man, all I'm saying is the sooner we realize what the hell is going on here, the sooner we're gonna deal with it, all right? - You know what, man? I'm not supposed to deal with all you dumbass dickheads. - No, you're the freakin' dickhead, man. - Come on, man. - All right, get off me! - There is no sense sticking around here. All right, why don't we all go somewhere and try to make some sense of this thing? - Let's just take a break, man. Let's just take a break and try to think. - We can't stay here. - I will bring her. - It might not be safe. - Nothing in here is safe. (thunderstorm) - If I fell asleep, don't go anywhere, okay? - I promise. - I'm scared. I'm really scared. - Take a look at this. (laughing) - You could lie down if you want to. - Are you sure that's gonna be all right? (thunderstorm) - I like you, Rick. - That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. - Are you a virgin? - Kind of. - If you'd let me. Will you get the light? - I don't have anything. - It'll be all right. (spooky music) - Dude, come on. That's not gonna help anything. - You do it your way and I do it the right way. - Man, we gotta put our heads together and think. - Well, leave me out of it. - Whether you like it or not we're in this together. - I'm in nothing with you. - What is your problem? - You guys trying to gang up on me. I don't have the problem. Y'all trying to kick my ass 'cause I speak up. I'm the bad guy? - I give up. - Yeah, it's in your blood. - It seems like this magician who lives here got into some kind of accident. - Yeah, never mind him though. Who's lived here since? - Why would anybody move in and keep all this shit? - Maybe they were related. His wife probably. And after her family. - Okay, but where does that get us? Who the hell are they? - Back before the screams, back before we left the attic you said something. - That's right. You said you might have it all figured out. - Could you feel safe from the others? - You don't wanna stay here. It doesn't matter where we go. It's over. - Kendra, what are you talking about? Tomorrow morning, all of us will be out of here. - I know it. I feel it. This time I'm sure. - Kendra, you don't believe that. - Me and Dean. Here. Take a look. - Oh boy. Oh God. - Why wouldn't you wanna tell us what you said? - It's a matter of free speech. Ever heard of it? - Then speak freely. - That's what we're talking about, man, freedom. - Come on, man. Just tell us what you're gonna say. - What are you gonna do if I don't? - You said anybody's gonna... - I did. - I think you better wait for help. - Nobody's waiting. - You know what? One minute you wanna guys wanna kick my ass because I won't shut up. And now you guys wanna kick my ass because I won't spill my guts? This indecision is killing me. - I'm getting outta here whether you're coming or not. - I made it up. I don't know anything. - He's lying. He's got something. - Come off it, man. What you got? - I won't tell you shit. Bitch. - He's got a deed to the house or some kind of family tree there. - All right, I've had enough of this. - What are you gonna do now, Mr. Bitch? - No, Marc. - You ain't got the balls. - You leave with us or leave behind. - I know he has it. It's in his pocket. Make him fucking give it to you. - So it's like that? Fuck! - Get back there... - I can't. - Dean, get that fucking deed. (gun shot) - You shot me, man. Oh man, I'm bleeding. Somebody help me, man. - I just wanted to scare him. He forced the trigger, man. - Shit, man. Oh my God. It hurts, man. I'm getting cold, man. Guys please. - What if he was right? And you guys just killed the man. - Wait. Hold on, wait a second. - You're as much a part of this as we were. - Not a chance, pal. - Oh yes, you were. - I won't testify to that. No way. - Just a fucking minute ago, you were right behind me, man. - You all stink like crazy. Loose shot from a fucking crazy gun. - He's the one that killed him. - No, he didn't. - Like hell! - No, he couldn't have. I took the bullets. - What? - All you have were blanks. - You did what? Are you fucking out of your mind? - Sooner or later you'd take it out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't you ever... - You didn't kill him! - fucking ever do that again! - Don't you get it? You didn't do it! - What happened? - It was an accident. - Oh my God. - I'll testify to it. I saw the whole thing. - The dude grabbed the gun but it's filled with blanks. - Now it's really happening. - No, it was just, it's complicated. - It's the same, isn't it? What's wrong with this house? - It makes no sense. - What are you doing? - Same as you if you have any sense. - He's not even cold yet. I can't believe you. - Don't you get it? Get this straight, I am getting out of here no matter what it takes. - I don't understand why you didn't use that thing on that Jomo creature. - I'm not a goddamn killer. - Maybe we could've figured something out. How could anybody be so dumb? - Maybe it wasn't the best decision but there are worse things. - Colossal dumb. So fucking dumb! - Don't throw in that word around a lot. Don't get too comfy with that word. - What are you gonna do? You'd kill me? - I didn't kill anybody. Did you already forget that? - Somebody's gotta say something to his friend. - Yeah, what's his name? Rick? Where is he? - He must've heard the shot. (haunting music) - Rick. Rick, wake up, man. Rick. - What? - I got bad news. There's been an accident. Bruce is dead. - What? - Nobody meant for it to happen. It just happened. - How, man? - Everybody, I'll tell you the same thing, man, okay? - The thing for us to do now is to stick together and make it out of this fucking house. - Kendra. Kendra, you better hear this too. - Kendra. (sobbing) (spooky music) (screaming) - Oh my God. (screaming) - That's impossible. - Her fucking legs are gone, man. Oh fuck! - Fuck! - I gotta get out of this house. I've got, I've gotta get out! - What did you do to her? (screaming) What did you do to her? - I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. - Fuck! - Nobody's saying you did anything, man. But you must've heard something. - Yeah, yeah, did you see anybody? How could you sleep through that? - No, I didn't do anything! - Rick! Knock it off, man. - Oh my God. No, don't! - Come on! - He's gonna kill him, no! - Okay guys, guys, stop! - Dean! Stop! Dean! - Stop! - He's gonna kill him, no. - Cut it out. Come on, man. - Stop it! - You didn't have to do that, you know! - No, I didn't. (sobbing) (banging the door) - Okay, all right. - That's her leg. Hey, man, she's not coming back. - We gotta figure this out. - What's there to figure out? There's a murdering crazy motherfucker on the loose. - Look, calm down. Let's be rational. - Rational? We got half a bitch in a bath tub. - She's not dead. I just can't believe she is dead. - Nevermind what you believe, all right. We all gotta think. - How can you even think? - No, no, he's right. I mean what's the alternative? - Look, let's all sit down and have a look at this family tree. Everybody that includes you. Look, everybody take a look at this thing and see if anything stands out to you. Look at it. - Why would anyone cross on a name on a family tree? - I was thinking the same thing. - So was I. And look at the first name Mesmer and he's crossed out he's been replaced. - Yeah, him and Abigail were married, right? It's like they kept it a secret for some reason. - Wait, you said there was some kind of deed. - Yeah, there's a deed just like the tree but it's been replaced. - And he was checking him. - The person who took his place. - The wife stayed the same. Somebody pushed out the first husband. - Okay. - It was the magician's assistant. - Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on any stage anywhere, this side of heaven or hell, I give you the never before witnessed, the most awe inspiring death defying spectacle in the history of time. Mesmer The Magnificent presents "Escape from the Fires of Hell". (haunting music) - Ladies and gentlemen, notice the wrought iron handcuffs, courtesy of Lynchburg Police Department. Observe the metal linked chain bondage, the strongest produced by Bethlehem Steel. See for yourself. Be observant of getting past even more impossible obstacles and recognize what can only be described as insane ambition. (haunting music) (coffin closing) (nail hammering) (chain noise) - Accident. (knock on the door) (spooky music) - No, no, no, no, no. - Elena is that you? - No, no, please no. Don't hurt me. - We've been looking all over for you. Hold on, wait a second. How did you get in here? - That monster, that monster thing. - They're gonna be so happy you're alive. Careful. Let's get out of here. (spooky music) - Wait a minute. Isn't this the same stuff from the bedroom upstairs? - Alexis, come on. - Wait, wait, wait, wait Maybe his death wasn't an accident. - Gary, you said something about a trap door. What is that? - It's a door with a false bottom. Look at this. That's my name. That's my fucking name! Jesus. - They killed him. - Wait. Everyone look close at these names. - Why? - That's my mom's fucking maiden name. Is there anyone here who doesn't recognize a name from their family on this sheet? So what if we're all related? What's that mean? - We're the descendants. - The reason for the killings is to make us all pay. - What, Dean? Pay for what? - And for who? - Maybe some kind of serial killer. - Of course. He's dead, himself. - They say that the undead stick around in no man's land, you know? Just waiting for revenge. (laughing) (banging on coffin) (crowd applause) - Help! Help! Hit it. The back door. Hit it now! - Somebody do something. - Let me out! - Get the water. - Help! Come on, come on, get the water. Get the fucking spotlight! Come on. Do something! - Hurry. Somebody. - Help! - No! Somebody save him! - Get the water. - Save him! Oh my God. He's dying. - Get him out! - Help! - Somebody. - I'll catch the both of you! Why don't you go to hell! - We're sorry! I'm sorry! But we didn't do it. So please, please, please, please spare us! (spooky voices) - He's been here all day. Does anybody see anything? - No, no, no, fuck, no. - I don't see anything. Wait! (screaming) - Robin! Robin? (spooky voices) - Holy shit, she's bleeding. - He killed me. He killed us both. He bound us both in chairs and sat us across from another. We were naked with only a gun in our hands. - What happen to your clothes? - And he set rats on us so that we'd either have to get eaten alive or kill one another before they got to us. - Suzanne, is that you? - She sounds different. - Suzanne? - We thought he was dead. We thought he couldn't get to us. - Suzanne, what are you saying? - But he got to us anyways. His reach is too powerful. It could come up from our grave. - Tell her not to talk like that. - Suzanne, are you okay? - He's not gonna let you get away. He's coming for you next. - That's not Suzanne. - He's not going to get tired. He'll never forgive you. - Suzanne, what has she done to you? - Dean, make her stop. - His hate is unstoppable and it never takes rest. - Shut up. You don't even know what you're talking about. Saying things you don't even know. - You're a liar. (screams) It's him. He's the one right there. That's him. He's the one. He's the one coming for you. - Give me the gun before somebody gets hurt 'cause you're the one that has to be stopped. You're freaking scaring everybody. - For chrissakes people, watch out for your lives. - That's not Rick. - He's not who you think he is. The one who's coming for you. He's the one. - I just wanna use the door. You're the one with a gun. - It's a trick. It's a trick! - Maybe he wants to come in. He wants someone to open the door. - I'm with you guys. I'm not just gonna stand here and let them come in here and kill me or something. Come on. - You wanna get a headstart? Touch that fucking door. (laughs) - Bitch, please. - Rick, don't. (gun shot) (screaming) - You crazy ass bitch, motherfuck... - What just happened? - You killed Rick. You just killed Rick! - Don't. Stop. - He's dead. Don't you see that? - Give us the gun. - No, wait. - She killed him for nothing. - I didn't kill anyone. - Come on. Let's just go out the door. - No, no, no, no, wait. There may be a killer out there. - There's a killer in here. - The door is open. No one's coming in. - Somebody needs to close it. - I'll close it. I'll close the door, okay? Just give me the gun. - No, no, no, no. I'll close it myself. - No! No! Now what? (sobbing) Now at least we'll know where he has to come in from. That'll give us time to figure something out. - Something like what? - Something. I don't know. Something, Dean. (screaming) - Stop screaming like that! - I just saw a head. The magician. - There's nobody else in here. - I know what I saw! - You didn't see anything. No one else saw anything. There was nothing to see. - Don't you tell me. - Your mind is playing tricks on you. - I'm telling you, he was standing right here. - Your eyes must be tired! - I saw what I saw! I'm telling you he's here. - I'm not sticking around here. I'm not gonna let him get me. No way! - What do you mean? - Just what I said. - What the hell are you doing? You know the door is locked. - What the fuck. - No! (banging the door) - Suzanne, open the door! - She's only looking out for herself and to hell with everyone else. - Fuck! - Just when (mumbles). And I was worried about her! - Hurry? For what? - Marc, what if she's a reincarnation of that magician's wife? - She did kill Rick. - She brought out that business with Bruce, too. Don't forget. - That's more far fetched. - Oh yeah, look what she's done to you. - What? - Suzanne! Suzanne, open up! - Look at the magician's wife... - Suzanne! Can you hear me? Say something if you can hear me. (banging on the door) - Holy shit! - Shit! - Maybe we should see about her. - Why? She didn't give a damn about any of us. (door opening) - It was closed. - What the hell happened? - Why are you guys all looking at me like that? - We thought you were dead. - I saw that guy Jomo again. - Jomo? What was he doing? What did he say? - He wondered what took us so long. - What? - For what? - To find the way. - What? - That's what I said. - That's gotta be a joke. - Or some kind of trick. - No. Find out for yourselves. He said we were so close so many times. We were there and we didn't even know it. - It was some kind of game? - I'm going. - Me too. I gotta find out. - Oh you're not leaving me here. - Somebody should stay. - What are you talking about? - Listen to me, what if it's some kind of trap? What if we need your help? - What can I do? - That's ridiculous. - Get us out in case. - In case what? - In case, just in case. You stopped trusting me. - Don't. - Haven't I promised you? Haven't I always said that I was gonna get you out? - We can't trust him. - Not that. - I'm not blind to this situation and I know you're not either. I'm telling you now, look at me. - I came back to get you guys but I'm not gonna wait all day. - There's something I need to tell you, will you stay? - No, let me go first. - Robin, please. - I'm pregnant. (sobbing) (spooky music) - The door. - Follow me. (haunting music) This way. - Why didn't you tell us about this before? What's the catch? - This way. (elevator door closing) - Oh my God. Oh my God! - It's not gonna work, do you hear me? This won't fucking work! (sobbing) (elevator door opening) (spooky music) - Dean, come over here. - What the hell. It's not what I think it is. - Oh please. - No, not that. Tell me what? - Don't do that. Don't you dare! - I can't help it! I'm so scared. - Somebody tell me what? What are you talking about? - I can't. I don't wanna look. - It's not what I think. It's what I know! - Shut up! Shut up! Don't say nothing. I swear to God don't. We're gonna keep calm, wait and find out. Okay? (coffin opening) (screaming) - I knew it! - It can't be. No, God please. - No, you don't know anything. Shut your fucking hole. No! No! Open it. Oh my... - [Voiceover] Bruce Powell, Marc Pearce's matrilateral second cousin once removed was removed from the house's living room. No gun shot wound detected. The pulverized body of Dean Tisdale, grand nephew of Theo Aidner, was pulled from beneath the elevator door. The remains of Marc Pearce were found riddled with hundreds of rusty coffin nails. The family of Alexis Cruz continues to block from publication any details surrounding her demise. The charred body of Elena Sanchez, parallel cousin of Alexis Cruz, was taken from the floor of the guest room shower. The body of Kendra Miller, patrilateral cross-cousin to Suzanne, was removed from the upstairs bedroom, her severed legs from the master bathroom. Every bone in the body of Suzanne Pratt, granddaughter of Abigail Mesmer and Theo Aidner, was found to have been broken. - No, no, please no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Please no, no. God no.
