You idiot! I thought it was dad. Dorian Gray. - Any good? - Yeah, you bet. It's about a guy who... Chill, Brian Bookworm. Like who gives a shit. - You're going? - Yeah. How do I look? Awesome. We agree then. And you? Gonna read all night? Yeah, sure. Good-looking boy. That'll knock 'em dead tonight. Love ya, mom. Léo! Am I grounded? Vivier's coming by this week. - Dad, you told me. - I know. They need a point guard. - It's important. - No kidding. I'm gonna take off. Big kiss, mom. - Big kiss, dad. - Yeah, have fun. Go easy, you need to be in shape next week. - He knows. - Yeah, no worries. I am worried. I know what he's like. A team night out can go south fast. Be careful. Don't touch any crap! - I'll just drop a... - Knock it off. - I'm serious. - Vincent... He'll be late. Let him go. Relax. Go, run along. See you tomorrow. Shit! Nearly lit my nuts on fire 'cause of you. What the hell! We're late. Mom came to say goodnight, nearly busted me. Pussycat... First party, first high. Don't like it? Buckle up. What then if you quit basketball? Dunno. I could... do something else. - Like what? - I dunno, Tom. You asked... Travel. I could travel, see. - That's not a job. - Back off. I dunno, you asked... I could go back to college. Just not basketball. College is cool. If you ask me, with your grades, stick to basketball, dude. Thanks a bunch, you douchebag. After so much training, Dad would kill you if he heard you. Let him go to the Academy. But you... "You have the gift!" I won't miss 6 AM wakeup to go running with him. I can't wait to take off. Tom... You'll come see me play? And I'll be home for weekends. It's not so far. I'm with Tom. He's happy. He's smiling. Tom, get out! Get the hell out! Get the hell outta there! - Open up. - I can't. If you don't, you'll die. - Fast! - It's jammed. Tom, get up. Don't look back. Run. C'mon. I'm here. MAN UP 2 years later What's he doing? It'll be cold. Too bad, he'll eat it cold. Sorry. Morning, dad. Hi. Morning, babe. How's construction going? Still waiting on permits for the 80m masts. Besides that, fine. 80 meters. That's big. Sure, it's big. I gotta run. Can you drop Tom off? But I can't pick him up if I'm at your ultrasound. No worries, I'll be fine. If you say so. My tummy churns when I'm nervous, too. You took your meds? I'm sure it's a great school. Everything will be fine. It was hard getting you in. I don't want mom to get upset right now. So, no outbursts, no trouble. Yes, don't worry. - Have a good day. - Thanks. You too. ALBERT ROCHE HIGH SCHOOL Shit. You made it. You bet I made it. What did you expect? First day, new school, stress off the scale. - I'm good. - Remember... Make first impressions count. Screw that up and you're dead. If you're like that... that's your future. Brian Turtleneck. Same goes for that guy. Brian Metalhead. Or even Brian... Pocahontas? You've got it down, dude. Tom... So you don't wind up like them, 2-step program. Step 1, avoid them. To the cool kids, if you have a dork friend, you're a dork. No invites to parties, wearing your dad's turtlenecks like him. The eternal virgin. Game over. Step 2. Get in with the good guys, the right crew, from the get-go. Like those guys. See the difference? Not dorks. Dorks. Go in there, and you act cool, chilled. Everybody here will see you're a cool, chilled guy. Even if you're not at all chilled. - Want me to hold your hand? - I'm good, I've got this. I'm watching. Cool and chilled, bro. Cool and chilled. Hey. Hey! Whassup? I'm new. I'm looking for room 223. What's funny, bro? - Sorry, he can't read. - I can. Steve. Victor, who can't read. And Sonnie. Room 223. That's C Building, right? No, D Building. - Which one? - That's on the other side. You go that way, across the bridge and right. - Left. - Across the bridge and left. There's a gym. Past the gym, there's a park. Move it, you're late. I'll take that. Spanks, guys. Spanks? Spanks. Let's see the chick's photo. - Here. - Watch this. That bridge over there, then left. He's gone for good, guys. Come in. Sorry, problem with my... Sit down, Clarisse. Point two. Revolution and reaction... What brings you here? Who are you? Ramirez! Put the hyena away. Over here. Tom Bannière. This is my class. Are you sure? Alright. You skipped a year? No. That's a real shame. The standard of the class needs a boost. Not laughing now. Find a seat somewhere. So, the totalitarian regime in 5 key points. Number 1, a dictatorship. Which spawns a police state. Found his girlfriend? And uniformity of thought. Better than no thoughts at all. Indoctrination of youth in a personality cult. That's crucial, the personality cult. Absolute obedience to the leader and immediate superiors. Such as Mussolini in Italy. All that comes into play. Relax, she's like that with everyone. Valerie, my shrink, says she's bipolar, transferring her frustration on students. I'm guessing it's to heal a narcissistic wound from childhood. A bitch, in a word. Danvers! I'm Jean-Baptiste. Or JB, if you're American. I'm not American. I thought as much. My friends call me JB. You play sports? - Yeah, I... - I hate sports. Except e-sports. All sports are better as video games. Less sweaty. You play e-sports? No. Too bad. It really relaxes me. That's how they roll. Pains in the ass. Her, especially. That's why I'm not dating. "It's complicated." My favorites are Dr. House and Game of Thrones. Never spoil Game of Thrones. You're warned. Dr. House, saw it all, know all the diseases. Game of Thrones... Why rock up now, mid-year? - You always ask lots of questions? - Yeah, sorry. Asking questions helps me relax. - You gotta be super relaxed. - Yeah. Booboo? Don't call me Booboo in public. - You did the math assignment? - Obviously. Swap it for my history essay? It's in my locker. Sorry, I gotta go. Hold on, you're buddies? No! She's my sister. Or half-sister. - I gotta dash. - Move it. - Why talk to him? - He's cool. He's a dork. Ignore him. Shit, she's hot. That's Brian Pocahontas's sister? Gets my vote. Reminds me of my ex, Justine. Justine the airhead. Respect Justine. I admit... She was no brainbox. But she had assets. Remember dad's face when he saw her? Panic. That's nothing, dude. A couple hundred crunches a day. In two years, ripped. You're right. Forget the chick. She's out of your league. Letting everyone walk all over you all day, you blew it. You didn't step up, Tom. We agreed, cool and chilled. Were you cool and chilled? Next time, you gotta give as good as you get. Or they'll rip on you the whole time. Trust me. Like last time. Shit, get over it. I gotta get home. Sure, go home. Go see mommy and daddy. They'll be worried. Move it. I loved seeing him. Yeah. Well? - Fine. - Tell all. I gotta study. Alright. Want to know about the baby? It's a boy? Congratulations. That's ok. He's fine. You going running? Yeah. Can I come? Gone in 5. How many k is that? Already tired? No, just wondering. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose. Out through your mouth. Run at your own speed. Let's go! Ok? Yeah, ok. You want to head back? No, I'm ok. I may go see your brother. Want to come? Not too much. You think he comes here every run? What do you think? You know, he'd be sad if you died, too. Sure, not as sad as with me. Let's blow. Tom, come on. Leave him be. Come on. What's up with the chick? Who do we pick? Dunno, all three suck. - Perrine? - Best of a bad lot. You're kidding me. Down to you and Brian Four-Eyes. Dylan. Look, he's all strung out. They lose with the dork. Upside is you're with the hottie. You won't regret it. I just took what was left. We're not here to lose. Over here. You ok? Guys, let's play clean. This is where it's at. Go, guys. Take it up. Not her. Get him. Here, I'm clear. Charge. Take him down. Do it. Smash him. Charge. Game over. Eyeball him. Everyone's watching. Cream him, grow a pair! Hold that gaze, hold it. Shit! Why ignore me? Make that pass, we smash them. I'm sorry. Next time, we'll hit our straps. Get over yourself. There may not be a next time. By the way, I fight my own battles. So thanks, but no thanks. Yeah, you're buff, bro. How'd your sister date that? He's buff, big and popular. She's 17. Hormones talking. Anyway, they broke up. Never heard of those. They're vitamins. - I'm going to see the nurse. - You ok? Sure. We're buddies, the nurse and me. He lets me power-nap. 10 minutes worth 3 hours' sleep. Wanna come? No, I'm waiting for the shower. Good luck. Shit. Motherfuckers! It's Steve, for sure. No, Victor! Who cares, I need my clothes. Bad idea, that stinks. - Got it. - The sock? Now you just gotta get all your other duds. That's right. Strategy. 5 seconds there, 3 seconds pickup, 5 seconds back. 13 seconds. 13 freakin' seconds. Don't crack, dammit. Don't show a thing. Feel no shame, shrug it off. You're in control. Leave your stuff here. Chin up. Jaw clenched. Dick first! What's going on here? Swear to god, dude's got balls. Hey. Straight up, nice dick. Respect, dude. Rocked it. Morning, ma'am. Told you, kid's got balls. Hey, Clarisse. See you. Let me through. Here. Shit, no hangups about your body. You hit fresh air. You get the concept? - Controller's bugging out. - Yeah, sure. You're doing great. Kikoken! - Decider? - Isn't that like 6-0? - I stopped counting. - Count me out. Your sis is home? No idea. Are they yours? The pictures? You did them? Yeah, I did. They're really good. You think? Yeah. Can I show you something? The crux of my work. Hold on, is that Dr. House? Typical. It's Hugh Laurie. The actor. That is Dr. House. It's when mom was sick. I binge-watched the series. Dr. House always finds the cure. Your new rug carries a deadly virus, he's on it. You're saved. That's TV. I kinda fixated on the character. It was therapeutic. Then I became a fan of the actor. He did all kinds of stuff. Yeah. I draw him in everyday life. Kicking back. And here... - Not so everyday life. - Right. That one was a real battle. Two math classes. That one, it's felt pens and watercolors. Ghastly. I never show anyone. I'm scared people think it's pathetic. It's not at all pathetic. It's getting closure. You lost someone? Yes, my big brother Léo. Two years ago. You got closure? Sorry, bathroom? Just opposite. Harvest all that intel, buddy. That's right. See what she likes. What she reads. Looking for my panties? They're here. I was looking for the bathroom. Great room, I love it. - Compliments. - Love the color coordination. About her. She's not an interior designer. It's not how I imagined it. You imagined my room? Man, she's good. Confident. It's just, at school, you come off kinda... You see. No, I don't see. Me neither. Can you put my stuff back? Yes, sure. Just so I know... - Did you like it? - Why? - You read it? - This? Sure. Bullshit. Seriously, I swear. Who's your favorite character? I like Colonel Brandon. He's shit boring and ugly. Maybe so, but he winds up with Marianne. Maybe so but he's her fallback. She wanted Willoughby. You all want a Willoughby. No, not true. Tom, still on the can? I'll go. How about a movie one day? You're very confident for a guy I saw butt naked. Colonel Brandon! Not hungry? Sure, I am. Would you mind closing your book, so we can have a conversation? Sorry. I'll take seconds. You know the baby won't be long now? Actually, mom, can I borrow others? Yes, of course. Cool. So we're going to get the baby's room ready. We'll need to move Léo's things. If you want, you can help, so you keep anything you want... I want to keep everything. We keep it all. - Don't touch it. - We can't keep it all. I'll clear. I haven't finished. Hey, it's Léo. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. Or not. Bye! Relax, dude. Mom won't do a thing. She won't touch my room. What do you think? She'll give my duds to an old bum? Without dad chiming in. He didn't say a word. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Shittyass baby. - Know what? Nobody touches your room. I promise you. You promised. Hey, Clarisse. How about the movies then? You two? The movies? I don't know. I'm warming up to race. Challenge her. Let's make a deal. If I win the race, we go to the movies. What if she wins? Good point. What happens if I win? Whatever, but... you won't win. - I'll wait at the finish. - Cute. Respect your pedigree, please. Don't look back. Play it mysterious. Girls and boys, I put together an obstacle course. It's Hunger Games. Be careful. Don't injure yourselves. And pace yourselves. Control your breathing. Got that? Ready? Not too fast, I said. Go, Tom. Kiss goodbye to the movies. You're done? Just as I thought... Last place, that's great. Turns out you're a dork. Dork. I'm not a dork. Dork. I'm not a dork. Yeah? Prove it. You're running now? Run, Tom. Shit, Tom, run! It's fatso Victor! Go! Tom Bannière! Crushed them all! Good job, Tom! Drink. Good. Here you go. A banana. I don't want you blacking out. Or I'll catch it from JB. - Thanks. - Sure. You did great. Except the dead faint, which was kinda soft. You did good. - Ok? - You left him alone? It's cool, he's fine. Don't swipe my medical dictionary. I know. Which movie now? Gotta choose good. What? It's not about the movie. You're not taking her to watch it. Are you? So, I pay for everything. We take our seats. 15 minutes of commercials, it goes dark. And I lay it on her. You think it'll work? I grabbed your things. Great, thanks. I didn't hear you. I was on the phone. I got your phone too. Shit. JB, wait! You don't need Pocahontas. Forget it. I thought we were friends. I never lied. I even told you about Hugh Laurie. - You hold out on me. - Not true. The lie about your vitamins? They're tranquilizers. I looked them up. So? Only my friends call me JB. You're gonna talk? I'll tell you. But not here. I know a place where no one goes. - That's insane. - Not so loud. It's the library. So it's a ghost helping out a little boy. Shit, the little boy is you. No, wrong. Fight Club, then. You and your bro organize it, so we fight to become men? - Not sure I want in. - Look at him. I'm not into fighting, but I try. He'll blow a gasket. Some days, I think, that guy... - Sorry, go ahead. - It's not like that. He's there when I need him. When I'm anxious or scared. He reassures me. Been there. - You have? - Yeah. As a kid, I had an imaginary friend. Pilou. Pilou? A panda. He went away? He's right here. Ok, Pilou? He's shy. Kidding. He took off when I grew up. I knew he was joking. So it's just a phase, it's normal? Hardly. You talk to your dead brother. So what? Where's the problem? Do your folks know? So what are the tranquilizers for? So I don't lose it. Why? What happens when you lose it? I don't know. - You'll get it back. - That's my phone. Back off. Quiet! I don't remember. It's like fog. He's a psycho. He's sick. I'm nuts? Completely schizoid. My shrink says everyone's nuts. If everyone's nuts, no one's nuts. But you're a bit weird. Don't worry, it's cool. Seriously. - Evening. - Hi. Where's mom? Tom, come on. Move it. Just do what I say. Come on. Eyes on the road. Not on the stick. - I can't get the right one. - Speed it up. There you go. You gonna step up or not? Nailed it. You're on your own now. He taught me one summer. Why go so slow? I know. He made me promise to keep it secret. You're pretty good. Come on. Anything you want? You and your dad tire me out. No one can ever replace Léo. He'll always be my son. And your big brother. Always. Come here. Toss it out? You have your cell. Maybe buy you a new one? Yeah. Let me see. - I can get it taken in. - Really? Turns out, you never step up. You promised. How could you do that? I had no choice. I'm sorry. Mom wants us to move on. Wants us to move on? So you don't need me? Right? I gotta blow? Shittyass karma, bro. What do we do? What do "we" do? You wanna move on? Move. Alone. Hey. They insisted on coming. They're big fans. It's no problem? No worries. Two tickets for Possession, please. - I got popcorn. - Great. Save us two seats. Two for Possession, please. Young man, I'll need to see some ID. It's rated 16 and over. I forgot it. Sorry, I forgot it. I'm 17. Without ID, I can't let you in. We're in the same class, we're the same age. Sure, but I need ID. The film's full-on. You didn't ask me. Be cool. You look your age. It's cool, pick another movie. There's a fabulous anime cycle. We're not kids. - Forget it. - No way! Anime isn't for kids. Like I care! - You got brothers and sisters? - Yeah. I mean I had a brother. He died two years ago. I didn't know. - Sorry. - It's no problem. - You'd have been crazy about him. - Yeah? Star basketball player. Planned to turn pro. Dad said he had the gift. The gift? And what's your gift? Not basketball, apparently. For sure. Watching you play. Come on, you're not exactly... Not exactly what? - I know it, at least. - You do? Know what? Come on, I've got an idea. The problem isn't your size, it's using it. You're not bad, but you can't play like you're 1m80. Quit trying to charge. Come on. So what do I do? Use your speed. Come on! Well played. Sweet! Don't start showing off. Where's your strength? What's that? Block. I can't feel you. Come on. I think the movie's over. Yeah. Where'd you go? Without ID, he thought we were under 16. Sucks. The film slays it. You missed a banger. - Let's go. - You bet. It's Tess's party in 2 weeks. If you wanna come... Yeah, that'd be cool. Sure, yeah, totally. See you. Totally. - You can dance, right? - Yeah, for sure. You cannot dance. You get a second shot, buddy. Your last one. You gotta nail it. Take a seat. Watch and learn. Copy me exactly. Music. Ok, mom? Yes. Hey, dad. Where you going? A party. Can I give you a ride? We got a building permit for two more wind turbines. Two megawatts. In basketball, we're gonna have a trial game soon. That's great, really good. Yeah, I'm in Group B. Isn't there a Group A? Sure. The best players. Alright. Our team's great. There's a girl I like. It's mixed gender? Yeah, it is. See over there? Look. Not rotating. No wind, nothing. Happy birthday. - It's not my birthday. - I won't tell. Drink it, relax. - Thanks. - It's our secret, right? By the way, sharp jacket. Looks good. Here goes. Drink. Seriously? Drink for real. Like this. Nice. Cool and chilled. Dude, this is the coolest party. - Is Léo here? - What? Is Léo with you? Don't mention that here. You're crazy. Sorry. Ball-busting Jean-Baptiste. - Can you play this next? - You got it. Hey, how are you? Great house you got. Hey. A new jacket? Yeah, like it? Yeah, I didn't expect it from you. Sure, it's my style. Hey, you hear that? - Our music. - It's cosmic. - You know this? - I love it. Me too. What are we waiting for? What are you doing? I don't see you that way. You see? I mean... Ok, I see. Don't take it... Stop that. Like we give a shit, buddy. There are other girls. - Sure. - Absolutely positive. Rambling drunk already? What do you want? Nothing. He peed in it. I didn't pee in it. Sure, he peed in... I took it bad when she blew me off, too. - So now you're cool with me. - Not just that. I saw your brother play. 4-5 years ago, regional finals. Léo Bannière? I'd no idea. MVP by a street. Triple-double, over 30 points. I remember. Where's he play now? He doesn't. He's dead. Shit. Sorry, man. Shot? Sure, you can do it. He can do it. One by one... Two, one, go. Way to go! Next one, buddy. Don't let up, go. Number three! Now number four. Number four, do it. It's a panda. A panda best friend? No, it was when he was a kid. Hold on here. For an imaginary friend, why pick a thing that exists? Why not something that doesn't exist? A dragon or a unicorn? - Unicorns exist. - They don't exist. - Do. - They don't exist. - That's what he draws in his notebooks? - No, it's not that. What does he draw in his notebooks? - Here, have a drink. - Drink it. Go on, do it. - Come on, spit it out. - Go on. He draws Hugh Laurie. Who? Dr. House. So say Dr. House, not Hugo Whoever. For real? Yeah. He draws him on a skateboard. He's shitting us. Look at him. JB? JB, come over here, old bro. Come on! You're an artist, Jean-Baptiste. - Come back here. - Wait! Booboo, come on. You lied to me. We're going. We offended them. Give him the bottle. Go on. Shit, that was an insane party, buddy. Those guys, I love them and they... Where the hell are you going? Gonna cry over the dork? Like you give a shit. Stop. - He's my friend. - Yeah? You don't need him or her. You need me. Period. Come on. Let's go back. I'm through. You are? So tell my why I'm still here? Why call him over? - He blanked you. - He did. On your own? So they work. I think so. Let's hope so. Be sure to respect the dosage. One, morning, noon and night. With lots of water at mealtimes. You loved my gift. Best gift ever. VIDAL medical dictionary Bastard, giving me that. How can I hate you now? I'm sorry. I know. It wasn't you. It was me. It always was only me. My shrink wants to meet you. It's all about you now. Like you're the patient. It's true, too. Go see him. That's good. Breathe in. And out. You're doing good. Warmup over. Bums me out, my exemption's up. I gotta do sports now. About the other day... The other night. I'm sorry, I was a douche. You were right. I'm not 1m80. And? And what? Gimme a break. That was so cute. You're into him? Quit bombarding me with questions. Enjoy the film. So you're both in the same class? And on the same basketball team? That's right. Tom didn't lie. Your family's crazy about basketball. Before. No one plays anymore. I wouldn't say that. - You didn't tell them? - What? He tells us nothing. - I don't know... - The trial game. Yes, that's right. Your... No, you never said. - You don't need to tell them. - Why not? Sure, I do. I will tell you. Tom and I are on the same team. Ten seconds on the clock and it's tight. A 2-point game. It's our ball. I get it, pass to Tom. He takes it to the 3-point line. Before he can shoot, Steve's over there in defense. Steve's one of your friends? Steve's 1m80, 85 kg. Not easy to shift. Anyway, Tom feints left and right. Steve's in a daze, ass on the floor. And then, Tom steps back over the 3-point line. He shoots. Mr. Serra blows his whistle. And the ball falls in the basket. We win, thanks to Tom. Well played, Tom. Well played. - He never said? - No. - You didn't tell them? - It slipped my mind. How could you forget? I forgot my tea. - I'll be right back. - I'll help. Why did you lie? Ok? Yeah, I'm good. Wanna go? No, it's cool. Sure? - Shit! - Smartasses! I want it back. What's going on? Badass now? Hiding behind her, badass? - Move. - Knock it off. Say that again. What you got? Stop, Steve! Stop it! Don't! This guy, seriously? Stop it! What you gonna do? What's with that? Hurt him. Cut it out! Look, his hand trembles. Careful with her. Stop, Tom. Are you ok? Why did you do that? Why did you do it? Leave him, I've got this. Alright? This is the second time. Cuts there bleed a lot but aren't serious. You had no choice. Of course he did. Ariane, he had no choice He should've let them beat him up? You did what you had to. Alright? Go get some rest. What's happening to you? Ariane, leave him alone. Proud of you, buddy. Don't feel bad. You did what you had to do. Never happy, are you? Know what? I was wrong. You won't ever step up. You won't ever step up. Grow a pair. For once in your life, grow a pair. You're useless. Not a man. Useless. You disappoint me. Badly. Leave me alone. Alright. Mom, wait. You know, sometimes... I feel like I'm... not myself. I feel like I'm... Like you're what? I'll get ready. Go on, tell me. Don't worry. What's wrong? Does it hurt? - What's going on? - Call an ambulance. On hold. - Come home, I don't feel good. - What? It feels all wrong. Where are you? - Ferrand. I'm coming. - It's too far. I'm on my way. Don't move. Ariane? Tom will take me. No way. He can't drive. Put him on. You can drive me there. Do not take your mother. - It's too risky. - What do I do? Listen. Wait for me. Got that? My keys. Upstairs. - Hurry. - But dad... Hurry! What are you doing? - Wait for dad. - You're not real. You can't do it. I can't let you try. Mom's wrong about you. Dad will know what to do. Leave me alone! Don't! Who do you think you are? What's going on? - What happened? - Come on. Hurry. Drive. What are you waiting for? You'll kill her. Her and the baby. What's going on? I can't do it. Answer me. You're just a kid, no biggie. You're right. Who's right? I never step up. Is that Léo there? Is it Léo? Quit pestering your brother. I'm sick of you two fighting. Not now. - He's driving me, he can do it. - Wrong. He's stronger than he thinks. Tom, you're brave. It's why you're here today. It's how you pulled through. Hear me? You stepped up. Hear me? I can't, it's jammed. Try switching to other meds I looked some up in Vidal Crucially, we got to them in time. Don't worry, sir. It's all good. - Is that your son? - Yes, there he is. Go see him maybe. - See you there. - Sure. We couldn't wait. I couldn't. I know, don't worry. I couldn't. It's just fine, Tom. Dad... I won't wait for you anymore. Alright? What? I won't wait anymore, dad. Understand? I won't wait anymore. No, dad. Come with me. Coming? Be right there. It's now? I think so. Sure? I'm sure.
