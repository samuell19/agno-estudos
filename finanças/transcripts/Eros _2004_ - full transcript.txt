It was, uh... It was two weeks ago... yesterday. That was the day that I lost my equilibrium. It was the day after we were told we'd be pitching the Samson account. And Hal, our head copy guy, comes in, and he's wearing a... What's the socially acceptable term? Toupee. This... Somebody hunted this, trapped this, killed this and taped it to Hal's head. You know, we're in shock. You can hear the molecules moving. And before we've processed this betrayal, Hal says, calmly, that he's decided to do something about his hair problem, and he'd appreciate it if we'd kindly refrain from making it a topic of comment or conversation. This is my team. They're good people. They're great at what they do. It's like jazz, watching them in a room. If we can't talk about this senseless tragedy of Hal's hair... [DRAGS ON CIGARETTE] I mean, you should see 'em. Faces like starving animals. They look at me. They look to me. You know, "Nick, say something to Hal, okay? Do something." [EXHALES] I mean, it's an alarm clock. They want a new concept for their shitty little alarm clock. You know the ad: [SING-SONG] "Samson. Because your time's important to us." That's what I... You know, that's... We're polishing the vase while the house falls down. Do you have an alarm clock? I do, yes. You happy with it? It does the job. Right. But you need a new alarm clock, Dr. Pearl, and it's gotta be a Samson. You want it with a new color, want a new texture. You want a bigger winder for better torque. You want a softer tick. If you wanna kick it off the nightstand every morning for a year, you can. Our interior mechanism is incredibly... robust. You see what I'm saying? Am I getting to you? The message is simple. Your life is lacking something. Is that short for something? Is what short for something? Pearl. Yes. It's short for Dr. Pearl. Oh. You were talking about alarm clocks? All around me, these other firms, they're hitting home runs. Left and right. [CLICKING TONGUE] "Melts in your mouth, not in your hand." [CLICKS TONGUE] That's great. "Dollar for dollar, you can't beat a Pontiac." [CLICKS TONGUE] The Marlboro Man. [CLICKS TONGUE] Any of your patients famous? I-I can't discuss my patients. Oh, right. No, I saw a skit about that once at a nightclub. "Doctor, patient. Patience, doctor." I don't wanna know their names or, you know, anything personal. Just if there's any products they mention... Mr. Penrose... Consumers take this seriously. Remember Jack Webb doing Chesterfield ads? I really can't help you there. Oh, my God. You look at their sales: right through the roof. I have the data. Your sister mentioned something about a recurring dream? The woman in the dream. "The woman in the dream." Why do you say it that way? PENROSE: No, Cecilia says it like that. And Cecilia is your wife? Yes. Uh-huh. And you tell her about the dream? I made the mistake of mentioning it once. Now it's just become a ritual. It was a ritual until, uh... until yesterday. What happened yesterday? I came into the kitchen, I was telling her about the dream. The latest installment. Because there's a woman in the dream. And when I wake up, I don't remember who it is. But in the dream, I know her, absolutely. You know, it's a very, uh... It's not a sex dream... exactly. But, so we're there in the... And I said, "Boy, who is it?" God. Because I was thinking about it. And... I felt like the air in the room had changed, or something. And I looked over... and there she was, shoulders shaking, and she's crying. Why was she crying? I don't know. Did you ask her? She wouldn't say. So she was upset. Yes. Mr. Penrose, have you given any thought to sitting down? Uh... Yeah. I'm wondering if cavemen sat around talking about their dreams and having coded conversations with their wives over cold venison. Do you often imagine that you're a caveman? No. I'm reasonably happy with 1955. Look at the advances in medicine: Polio, TB, the Dodgers. That was a joke. So how is it with Cecilia since her crying in the kitchen? Oh, it's great, it's great. She's like the nurse when I had my tonsils out. Civil... and unavailable. How long is it since you've been having this dream? That's the thing. It was the night Hal showed up with the new friend on his head. That's what threw everything off. You see that the issue with the woman in the dream is a test? I have to show Cecilia that I know the answer, or she's gonna be gone. That's why you have to help me. If this woman is pulling away from me, I don't know what I'll do. So I need to know the answer now. Now! Oh. Well, before I leave, I gotta know. Whoa, Mr. Penrose. If you can get my sister to put a sentence together... Mr. Penrose... Call me Nick. Nick. A human being is not a carburetor. We'll talk, we'll see what happens. You understand? Everybody's different. Yeah. You're under a lot of stress. Yes. You're anxious about the job, the recurring dream and the situation with your wife. You're much more anxious than usual. Exactly. Now, there are various ways I can try to help you reduce your anxiety. First one is to have you lie down on this couch over here. I'm sorry, on this couch? Yes, right here. Just put your head up on one end and slide your feet down the other end. Hm... This is working for people? The couch? I can tell you I've had great success with this couch. Should I take my shoes off? Yes, whatever makes you comfortable. Right. I'm not supposed to see you, right? Is that part of it? Yes, we don't want you on sensory overload. We want your mind completely clear. Oh, should I close my eyes? I find that that helps. Because I see things in great detail. It'll probably give... It would be good. If I just close my eyes for a moment? Close your eyes. Okay. PENROSE: Sometimes... I imagine myself as a person with no responsibilities. That's very interesting. But part of me knows that I enjoy it. Huh. Yes. Now I want you to tell me about your dream. Okay. But first, take a minute, go back to the beginning of the dream. Once you've gotten there, just pause for a moment, and hold the first image in your mind. Are you at the beginning? Yes. Tell me the first thing you see in the dream. A woman's face. Mm. Can you see the woman in your mind right now? Yes. Good. Where are you? Are you very close, or are you far away? We're facing each other in bed. It's just... We've... You know, it's right after. She has her hand on my cheek. All right, that's, uh... That's very close. Mm-hm. Think for a minute what it feels like to lie there. How do you feel? Good. Good. Then what happens? So now she looks at me with this kind of funny smile... and goes off to the bathroom... turns on the tub and lets it run. [GASPS] Ugh! This is when I realize that we've... We've been in this room before. Describe the room to me. Okay. Um... Feels like a hotel room. Doesn't feel like a place where anybody lives. The only personal effects in it belong to us. So when I hear the water running, I think: "Oh, I love it... that she's gonna take a bath." And I... I begin to imagine her getting ready. You know, taking off her makeup and putting her hair up. Oh, and I just get so... So excited thinking about it. And I decide... when I hear her turn the water off, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna go and get right in that bathtub with her. That's when the phone starts ringing. Hm. Who do you think might be calling? I don't know. Aren't you afraid of being discovered? No. Not even the slightest bit guilty? No. Not the tiniest bit? No. No guilt whatsoever. Hm. Then what happens? She sticks her head out of the bathroom and gives me this look that says, you know, "Don't we have better things to do than answer a phone?" I watch her from the bed in the mirror. She takes a bath, and she... She gets out and dries herself off. Oh, God, then she climbs up on the sink in front of the mirror, like a cat, and puts on her makeup. She finishes, and... comes back in the bedroom. I watch her as she gets dressed. Then she goes in the bathroom for a minute, closes the door. She goes in there for a minute, closing... Door closes. And she comes back out in the living room... picks up her purse and comes and sits down next to me on the bed. She puts her hand on my face. There's a glove on her hand. And then she kisses me. Then she leaves. I just lay there for a minute. Then the phone rings again. I go to answer it, but there's... There's no one at the other end. Then what happens? Then I wake up. Should I stop? No, no. Stay in the dream. There's more work to do. There's still a lotta... Lotta work to do. Oh? Oh, okay. I feel so sad. Well, yes. You want to be with her. Yes. All right, now. Stay there on the bed. You're in the dream now. And I want you to go back. I want you to go back in the dream to when the woman is in the bathroom. She got dressed, and she went into the bathroom. So let me know when you see her go into the bathroom. PENROSE: Mm... Okay. Okay, she's there? Yes. All right. The bathroom door is closed. Uh, yes. And you're lying on the bed. Yes. You're in the dream. Yes. You're still in the dream. Yes. Still in the dream. Yeah, I'm still in the dream. Very good. Yeah. Now, raise your head slowly. Slowly. Where are you? I'm standing. And where's the purse? The purse? Yes, you said that when she sat down next to you she picked up her purse. Uh... The purse is on the bureau. Right. Okay. You see it? Yes. Go to it. What? I want you to go to the purse. [GROANS] Uh, no, I... I can't. Why? She'll come out of the bathroom and catch me. Well, she might not. Yeah. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm so... I'm sorry. Don't! You're in a very vulnerable state and it's crucial that you not feel judged at this moment. Judged? If you turn around, any expression on my face, no matter how sympathetic or supportive, would be viewed and imprinted as criticism. And I cannot allow that. I will not allow that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Mm-hm. It's... Yeah. Okay. Mmm. [SIGHS] Mm. Let's go back to your work for a while. Oh, the Hal stuff? Forget the Hal stuff. The problem at work, the account, the alarm clock. Okay. You feel as if you've run out of ideas. Uh, no, I feel like I've run out of good ideas. Right, so something's missing. Mm... yes. Okay. All right. What's your favorite part of the dream? Favorite part... Uh... Oh, oh, when she's standing in the doorway, while the phone rings. Why? Well, because it's like she's... By standing in the door, and letting the phone ring, it's like she's keeping the outside world away for a minute. [INHALES SHARPLY] Oh, see, that's where I screw up. I answer the phone and the dream ends. Maybe if I didn't... Maybe if I didn't answer the phone, she would come back. So the phone is an interruption from the outside world? Yes. Kind of like an ala... Alarm clock? Maybe. Okay. Ah, the phone's an alarm clock... Are you going somewhere with this? Well, in the dream, she doesn't pick up the phone. She... savors the moment. Right. You hear the alarm clock in the morning. What happens? I turn it off. Yes, but what do you want to do? Go back to sleep. Why don't you? Because if... If I don't get up, I'll fall back to sleep, and I'll be late for work. Yes, yes, but you just want a few more moments of sleep. Just a few. Yeah, no, you'd have to reset the entire alarm, and the setting mechanism isn't that precise. What would solve the problem, then? Ah, well, you'd have to turn the alarm off, and then turn it off again automatically a few minutes later. Sounds simple enough. Yeah, just so you could get a little snooze. A snooze alarm. It's like a different button or something, but it turns the alarm off for, like, seven minutes or something. That'd be great. That would be great, a snooze alarm. The snooze alarm. Wouldn't you want one of those? A snooze alarm? Yes, I actually think I would. I would. Ooh, this is... Hey, this is good that I thought of that. Oh, this could be something. Snooze alarm. "Samson, the alarm clock of your dreams." Right? Sounds like one of those good ideas. Yeah. I ought to tell Cecilia. Hmm, can I get up now? Absolutely. Feeling better? Yes. I am. Good. I feel as if we accomplished something today. I hope you feel as if we accomplished something today. Mm-hm. It's a good feeling. Me too. It's good. Yep, I do. Thank you. Oh, no need to thank me. The work is its own reward. Days like today, I just feel incredibly fortunate. You look spent. Yeah? Breakthroughs can be exhausting. Why? Yeah, I feel really tired all of a sudden. Are you all right? Well, I just feel like I could lay down again or something. Well... You have some time left on your hour. Lie down, and I can... I'll just... [MUMBLES] That'd be great. Because I'm... Thank you. Mm. [SNORES SOFTLY] [**] [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] [BUZZING] [THUD] [ALARM STOPS] [GRUNTS, GASPS] Son of a... WOMAN: Nick, are you up? You must've hit the snooze alarm about half a dozen times. It's becoming a ritual, Nick. What? What? Promise me that you'll talk to Hal about his hair today. I gotta go. [PANTING SOFTLY] Hal? Can I level with you? We-we can't, uh... We can't go into Samson with this. We can't... pitch this. We can't present this. Uh, 'cause we don't have anything. We don't have anything. There's nothing... new. Nick, we've worked very hard on this, and I like to think we've accomplished something. Don't you feel like we- we've accomplished something? No. No, I don't. Well, neither do I. God, it's a nightmare, isn't it? I mean... we're living in the shadow of the frigging snooze alarm. It's... I mean, where do you go from there? [FAINTLY] It's horrible. What?
