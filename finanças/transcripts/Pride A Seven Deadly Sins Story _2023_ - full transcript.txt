Okay. I'll call you. - Goodnight. - Night. Mr. Boudreaux? - Yes? - You recognize this? It's my daughter's. Your daughter, Gabriella Boudreaux? That's right. Ms. Boudreaux. Is this your necklace? Where'd you find it? Gamble residence on a window ledge. They recognize it as yours. I'm not surprised. The two-year-old's always pulling on my necklace. Except they fired you six weeks ago. Said they found this after a recent burglary. Ma'am, can you turn around and put your hands behind your back? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Ella, Ella, this must be a mistake. Wait, wait. Take your hands off! Sir, I need you to stand back! This is a mistake! You can't do this! - Gabriella Boudreaux, you're under arrest for burglary. - Get your hand off of me! Don't say anything, I'm coming down there! Anything you say can and will be used against you. Another busy day at Birdie's Bakes. Business at the Chicago Bakery is booming. But my son Gabe is AWOL again, leaving me to work the counter. Welcome to Birdie's Bakes. Sorry for the wait, but you're about to get a slice of heaven. Ladies, y'all have yourself a wonderful day. Late again. Then you waltz in, give away stuff for free. You being late is the reason why they're in line. Mama, I told you I was going to the bank to get a loan to open up the Detroit location. What you talking 'bout? I want your regular hours to be at this location. If you gave me the money that you told me you was going to give me, I would not be down there at the bank begging for some money... Cut, cut. Cut, cut. Birdie. Only I can say cut. He doesn't get to talk to me this way in front of millions of people. Mama I'm just telling the truth. You making me look cheap? I gave you $100,000 of my own money. - Okay. - I can't go bankrupt. You find the rest. That's what I was trying to do. Okay, new angle. Let's dig into the financial risk for Birdie's Bakes because of the Detroit location. No, no, no. I have a successful business. All right, Mom, it's all good. Listen. Business involves risk. Right? Let's make it look edgy. Come on, now. We, we, we. Next, like, like Oprah. From talk show host to media mogul. Started from the bottom now we here. Started from the bottom now we here. Come on. Joe Boudreaux. No, we're not shooting tomorrow. I can come down and fix this for you. Looks like I'm going to Texas to fix your sister's mess. Baby... I got good news. You're getting out. Gamble's are dropping all the charges. What? Why? They know us, and they got the stuff back. Yeah, they're good people. Pops. What you not telling me? Yeah, your grandma helped. She came from the nursing home. Not my mama. Your mama's mama. The bakery lady with that reality TV show. She convinced the Gamble's on condition you live with them. Mama's been dead 15 years. Why does she remember me now and the way she treated you? Believe me. I know about the past. I'm talking about the future. You being in here? It's just one I can't live with. What's Ella like? She's smart as a whip. Oh, she's, uh. She's a good girl. - You look just like her twin. - Mama's? So you remember her then? - Ella? - What? We just going to act like this is some happy family reunion. You haven't seen me since Mama's funeral. And now you're forcing me to live with you. You could just do jail instead. - Oh, I'm thinking about it. - Ella. I'm trying to help you and keep our family name out of the mud. Well, we got different last names, so don't worry about your little show. Oh no. This is not going to work Joe. She's ungrateful. It's gonna work. It's gonna work, right, Ella, please. But I'm not going on TV. Don't worry. You'll be a regular bakery worker. Making five dollars above minimum wage, just like everyone else. - Minus room and board. - What? I'm not paying to live with you. Of course she would expect a free ride. I have barely existed for you. And now you're expecting me to live with you. Why? To keep an eye on you. Clearly you need a mother figure. Oh, like you. Well your parents didn't exactly knock it out of the park. Joe, kids need rules or else they'll become criminals. I remember sitting in the hospital room with Pops when he got home from a rock and your show was on the TV. I thought one check from you can make things right for us. Send me back to college. But nah, nothing. Okay, let's just move forward. It's what Tasha would want. It's what God wants. So this is how you spent your money. Instead of helping me and pops. Your pops ask and I help. All he ever has to do is ask. Beg more like. You don't get a thing in this world unless you open your mouth. - Oh, I have... - You, might get more if you shut yours. Room's upstairs. Gabe's old space. Oh, look at my baby. Ain't nothin' like a Gabe party! Mmmm. She gettin' old. Okay. You did good. They're good. Mom did good. She did right. But sooner or later not, this is all going to be mine. Feel me on this. Come on. Mm hmm. Mm. Sorry. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What you doing in my house? This clearly isn't my room. Okay. I'm sorry. - Tasha? - Birdie! Hey, hey, come here! Gabe, meet Ella, your niece. And how is this your house? I thought you had one with your son and his mama Partying like a teenager and smelling like a skunk. I'm sorry, Mom, all right? Weren't you supposed to, like, come home tomorrow? Hey, look, I'm sorry. Let's, uh. Let's try this again, all right? I am, your Uncle Gabe? Yeah? Come here, come here. Oh, my God. She looks just like her mom. She do. Oh, my God. - What are you doing? - For Instagram. Look, I'm not part of the show. It's not show's account. This is for the bakery. Birdie's pretty little granddaughter eatin' pie. That's going to get a lot of likes, right? No, don't! Ain't you supposed to be Gen Z? All Tik Tok and tech savvy? Also big into consent. She said no cuz. I'll delete it. Show me or it didn't happen. Lucky you the head of security around here. There it is. Thank you. We're a little extra cautious than most bakeries. We got some crazy fans. When you're done tasting I'll show you the security system codes, okay? Okay. That's my favorite right there, niece. Pecan pie. I'm allergic to tree nuts. I'm anaphylactic. You got an EpiPen? In my purse. Always. Okay, well, T-Pie. Our nut-free claim to fame. - Uh-huh? - Mmm? It's good. It's good. Classic sweet potato. What's the t stand for. - Named after your mama. - Yeah. Tasha's pie. Her recipe. What? No. Move! Ella, they're filming! Hey, you named a pie after her? What is this, some sick marketing ploy naming a pie after your dead daughter? I always loved her pie. Just not her. You crazy? She was my daughter. Funny way of showing it, never speaking to her or visiting. The first time we met, she was at the funeral. You know nothing about me and Tasha or what went on between us. I do know that this tastes nothing like hers. Makes sense since you never spent any time with her? You got it? Hey, you good? - Huh? - Yeah. Hey, look, you're right. Don't taste nothing like hers. Nothing like it. You know, your mom raised me, right? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. "Til she met your pops and got pregnant. Yeah, she talked about you a lot, - even named me after you. - Mm. She probably noticed we a lot of like. Good looking. A nose for trouble. Except I ain't get caught. Yeah, it's a different life when you don't have a rich mama bear looking out for you. Oh, ouch. Mama bear. - Yeah. - Okay. Birdie's favorite child has always been the bakery. Well, it was just me and Tasha. Then Tasha left. Just me. You think she gon' send me back to jail? Nah. Birdie knows she needs some new blood. She's just so big on being, self-made, you know. My momma's all about grit. Grit, grit, grit. Listen. As your uncle and your boss I say you show her some. Huh? - Yeah. Yeah. - Huh? You got some grit? - I got some. - Do you have some grit? Huh? Come on in here. It's uncle Gabe right here. You got some grit. You in this family, you got to have some grit, baby. That's all we made out of. You're gonna be all right. Think of the ratings. You've seen the numbers are not good. Here, try it. What is it? Real, Tasha pie. My mom's recipe. Tastes just like hers. How? That's between me and my mama. This needs to be on the show. Mm-mm. I just wanted Birdie to remember the real deal. This thing between you and Ella, it's so raw and real. It's perfect TV. - You all right, Mom? - Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. All right, all right. What's... What's going on over there? Oh, the producers informing Ella that since she walked on set and knew we were rolling that legally, they have the right to use the footage. You gon' let her tear you down like that? I'm betting she goes for the carrot. Come on, mama. And we shooting the scene in a more flattering and healing, you know, angle. You trust her like that? Have to trust her. She ain't been here five minutes mama. Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's my mama's recipe. This does taste just like hers. It feels like... It feels like she's still here. How did you make it? Oh! Tasting that pie, was like being with Tasha. And despite our differences, Ella has agreed to do her special run of Tasha pie until she shares the recipe. Which might be never. And cut! What was that? Huh? Mama, what was that? Oh. That ladies was amazing. You slayed today. A total natural. - Okay. - For real. Except nothing here is real on this reality TV show. You thought all this was spontaneous, like, oh, girl, you cute. Look, I knew editing, but come on, reenacting. Where you been living? You know, you act all tough, but I see you and I think it's adorable. You do? Yeah. So you're going to sign it? That wasn't so hard, was it? I think that'll work. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay. Thanks for letting me know. Ella, just got off the phone with the producers. The Tasha Pie episode is now the most streamed and downloaded episode. You did good, helped out your family. You could be proud of that. Didn't have much of a choice. They threatened to sue me. As you know. It's an easier way of making money than stealing. Look at your mama. So beautiful. She was. Looked a lot different after the chemo, but you never saw her that way. She's holding up her acceptance letter to the university of Illinois Champaign. The one beside it. That's me being accepted in medical school. You went to med school? I dropped out. I didn't know it. But your mother was inside there. And I couldn't support a baby in med school on my own. I needed money. So I went back to doing the only thing I was good at. - Baking. - And opened Birdie's Bakes. Took some years to build. I gave up everything for Tasha, but she was so bright reading at four, always top of her class and when she got accepted to Champaign, I knew it was worth it. She could fix my mistakes and break the curse. She was studying business to grow Birdie's Bakes when she met Joe, got pregnant, dropped out and moved to Texas. Mama was two credits away from graduating when she died, she went back to school after I was born. You dropped out of college, right? Third generation. Are you wearing Mama's ring? Right here. She always talked about it. Ooh. I got something to show you. Shouldn't this be somewhere safe? I like my things close by. This was my mother's. I gave it to your mother when she graduated high school. Should have waited for college. And if you graduate from college, then that's when you'll get it. - Oh. - You okay? Yeah, I'm just. I'm just tired. Baby, can you fetch my pills? Thank you. Whoa. That's a lot of pills. - Which ones? - Two red, one pink and one blue. Two of the ones with "“K" ”? Honey, I stopped seeing those letters a long time ago. Yeah, I got them. I'm going to just get you some water. Okay, here you go. Free advice. Don't get diabetes. Yes, ma'am. You get yourself some rest. Thank you. Watch your step. Church was good. Oh, Mom. What is going on? Are they giving my food away for free? No, no. You know, we got a little crowd after church always, right? Not like this. Tasha Pie episode aired the other night. Blew up our socials. You didn't notice, Gabe? I saw a little, you know, little increase activity. - Not a whole lot - Increased activity? More like a thousand percent increase. I think we got ourselves a star. What is going on? Everyone wants that new Tasha Pie. Can we talk? I think we might need to add a new cast member. Birdie? Gabe? Hello? - Ella, you're home? - Hey, Birdie. I'm getting too old for this. All this talking and talking. Oh, I wish Gabe was back. What is my jewelry box doing out? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You were home alone. Well, you probably took it out and forgot to put it back. Sign of aging. Good night, Ella. You ready? Birdie? Am I driving you? Birdie? Oh, come on. I didn't touch your jewelry. Birdie. Oh, come on, Birdie! Birdie! Birdie! Birdie! Oh, God. Oh my god. Good thing she stabilized. Besides the type two diabetes, anything else? - No, no. - You're sure? As far as I know. Look, is she gonna be okay? Looks like a diabetic coma. Lucky we're here. We catch them in time. People wake up. Okay. We'll get her to the hospital and stabilize her sugar levels. You got power of attorney? No, that's my uncle, her son. But he's back in Detroit. We're about to leave. You coming? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. How's Auntie B doing? Better. They stabilized her, she woke up and now she's sleeping. Can I talk to you? Yeah. Something was off with her pills. What do you mean? Like the wrong prescription? You know, the other night she asked me to get her her pills, two reds, a pink, and a blue. The red one was this bright red with a K on it. Now, today it's this dull red and the "“K" ” is gone. You mixing it up with the pink? No, I saw them side by side. You sure? There was a lot going on. That's what I saw. You go home, you get some rest. I'll stay with Auntie B. Okay. Thanks, Shan. Someone here need a lift? Did you call him? Well, what kind of security person would I be if I didn't make sure our newest star didn't get home safely? Thanks, Shan. I'm just gonna grab my coat. Yeah, take your time. Thanks for the lift. Happy to do it. I'm sorry about your granny. She's tough though she's going to be okay. You mind walking me in? I'm just a little creeped out. You good? Can we just check upstairs? Yeah. Thanks. All clear up here. Okay, let's check Birdie's room. Okay. Go home. Sleep. Thanks. My pleasure. I'll walk you out. - Goodnight. - Night. - We're rolling. - She needs to... I just can't forgive myself for not being there. Oh, I'm okay. You got to live your life. Whatever you need. We got you. I know. - I know, we're family. - And, cut! Great work. Take ten and we'll set up for some Gabe reaction shots. Bye baby. Thanks for coming. It's good to see the family together. Hey. Hey, man. I'm so glad you found us. Thank you. All right, good. I'm gonna go check on the rest of the bakery. - All right. - All right, all right. Hey, are you okay? You scared me. My hospital scenes are ratings gold. Zoe, did you get me holding Larissa's hand? Because I want the idea of me bringing the family together. Got it. Can we do some shots with you? I'm just checking in on Birdie. It's my day off. You sure this is okay? Doctor told me I got to move. I got a couple playlists on my phone. You want to have a little dance party? - A little something something. - Gabe. Come on, let's get you in the bed. Hello, hello. Is this a good time? Perfect timing. Pastor Trey is here because I need to talk to - both of you about something. - Okay. Gabe, you are my rock and my business partner, and it's just been you and me since you were little. Yes, ma'am. Ella, I know we've had some rough times, but you're Tasha's daughter, and I see so much of her in you. Anyway, I wouldn't be here without you. Thank God Ella found you. But they say diabetic comas are usually reversible if they find them within the first few days. That's just it. I don't just have diabetes. - I have leukemia. - Mom? Cancer? You can't be working. Going like business as usual. That's why you got to let me start doing the heavy lifting. And that's why I didn't want to tell you. I still have to do my thing. Now I want to talk about business. I don't plan on going anywhere yet, but when I do, you both are going to inherit the bakery. You just gonna drop this bomb out of nowhere. Look, I just started working there. - It's been Gabe's whole life. - I have two children. You're going to get your mama's share. Gabe listen, your mom knows that you've given everything to the business, and she's just trying to do what's right. Proverbs 13:22 says she's got to leave an inheritance for her children and her children... I'm not hearing your sermon today, Preacher. Gabe. So we ain't gonna... we ain't gonna talk about this? Son, we're talking about it now. This ain't no conversation. This is you delivering a verdict. You and your, your pastor. That kind of pride is dangerous. And I'm worried about him. Can we pray? Some crosses are too heavy to bear all alone. And, father, when your son's cross was too heavy, you sent help. Father. We need your help. We are standing in the need of prayer. Please don't let pride destroy what destiny has ordained. Give us your courage and give us your wisdom. Father, we know that Your Grace is stronger than anything we could ever face. In your mighty name, we pray. - Amen. Amen. - Amen, Amen. Pastor Trey. Please, sing my favorite hymn. ♪ I need ♪ The Oh, I need thee ♪ This very hour ♪ I need thee ♪ Oh, bless me now ♪ My savior ♪ I come ♪ To, to thee - It's gonna be all right. - Lord, have mercy. And, never feed the trolls. Just ignore them. If they don't stop or it gets worse, I will deal with it. Got it. And don't post your location until you're not there anymore. What? Isn't it just common sense? Yeah, but I got to say it. And whatever you do. Do not post about an episode until it's already aired. Our network will be all over you. Thanks, Shan, but I got to go. Uh huh, Khalil, don't tell Birdie. - Maybe. - Have fun. - Yeah. - Mhhm. - You got paid, Larissa! - From the producers. You said you'd pay me extra for showing up to the hospital. You Got paid for extra an extra day! Not from you! You know what? I'm done. You better pay me because you already owe me child support I just paid you last week! That's the last month, this is a new month, Gabe! You know what? I'm done. No money, no Devin. I'll kill you before I let you take my son! You better learn to change a diaper first. Hey, hey, come here. Let me check. What? Yeah. Applications to Sundance are in May, so. That's cool. Even I've heard of Sundance. Yeah, I'm going big. Don't want to go home. Doing the last little bit of editing. Save up some more money, do the sound. Oh, okay so that's why you cooked dinner tonight. You're saving money. Did you enjoy dinner? Yes. It was genuinely delicious. And you insisted on picking me up, so that was nice. You know, gentleman knows how to take care of his lady. Besides, anyone with a credit card can pay for dinner at a restaurant. But this way, you see, the boy has skills. No, I mean, I know. - I know a restaurant or two. - Oh, you do? You do? - I do. - You know a restaurant? One or two. Oh, okay. So next time. Next time. What you doing? Sorry, I got to go. Birdie's coming home from the hospital this morning and I have to be there. I'll drive you. You'll drive me? Yeah. Thank you. Okay. All right. I'll call you. - Goodnight. - Night. Ella. Mama? Ella. Mama where are you? Here. Here. Ella. Ella. Ella. Ella. Ella. Ella. Any dizziness, nausea? Ella's okay. It's just a bump. I reviewed all the video. Couldn't see much. They must have disabled the cameras. I told you an inside job. That's just speculation, Mama. Come on. They knew I had an alarm system. They knew how to disarm it. The security cameras, where my jewelry was. And that I was still in the hospital for. Poor Ella must've surprise them. I've worked hard all my life. And for someone to go through my things and take them! Such a violation. Aw, Gabe. It's gonna be all right, Mama. We gonna get through this. We gonna get through it. For somebody to steal from my mom. Ridiculous. I mean, if you need some money, she'll get you a job. That's the kind of person she is. I'm pretty sure everybody like to know, why you don't put your stuff in the bank like a normal person. Don't trust banks. I don't like those big institutions knowing my business. I like my precious things close by. And Gabe, I hid them. I hid them well. - All right. - Only someone I told would know where. Turned that thing off or I'm a punch you in the face. You're acting like I did this. Well, didn't you? Rob my sick grandmother? Isn't that what you did back in Houston, rob people? That you knew? Okay, well, that's not who I am now. And didn't they steal my Mama's ring? Oh, great cover up. But leopards don't change their spots. Or maybe you hired someone. Burglary. Great for ratings. Big Birdie's show. Hey, hey, hey. We don't do this. - We family. - Are we? Because I'm thinking I should go back to Texas with my real family. Come on, Mom. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. Going to be just fine. Hey. This could all be cleared up. Tell her you were with me that night. No. I'm going home. Okay, okay. What happened in Texas? I was arrested for burglary. But you were innocent. No. I wasn't. Birdie got me out on condition that I move here and live with her. Wait so, so you'll go to jail if you go back home? Well, it's better than living with someone who doesn't trust me. And now you know the truth about me, so. Did you rob your granny? Planning any future burglaries? Okay then. This'll blow over soon. But we won't. So please. Stay. Okay. Here's your change. That's it? Can you count again? You know what? It's okay. I already know the internet has decided I am some criminal mastermind. Me and El Chapo. You tell on TV where you were yet? - No. - Why are you so stubborn? Because I don't need to prove myself to her or to anyone. Your Houston arrest is all over Reddit. It's public record. - Why would someone post that? - It's the stupid internet. You're on TV, so you are fair game. Why do you think? I've never done a single episode? But, but the ratings last night was insane. I mean, that that thing when Birdie accusing you? That's gold in that baby. That's how we win. Where you going? We doing good, the network loving what we doing. What is what? I'm so sick of being called a thief when I was the one who was attacked. I'm going back to Texas. Ella. Where were you that night? Truth. I want to believe you. I spent the night at Khalil's. Okay? I came home at 4:30 to be here. When you got home from the hospital. Well why didn't you just tell me that before? Why didn't you believe me before? - Ella, please don't go. - What? With your Mama my pride got in the way, and I should have gone to see her when she needed me. But I can never make that right now. Please, Ella, stay. Let me make it right with you. Stay, please? Good evening, Ella Boudreaux? - Yes. - Where you heading tonight? None of your business. Actually, it is. We're here to bring you in for questioning about a burglary. - Am I under arrest? - Not yet. But since you are a flight risk, we can reach for that. No, no, wait. Can't you question her right here? No, ma'am. You coming? We need the cuffs. I got you, Ella. I'm coming down there. I got you. But one of the neighbors caught something. Can you tell? I don't recognize either of them. No. Me neither. You just went around and asked all the neighbors for their security videos. You'd be surprised what you can get with little pie. There's the proof she got home after. Mom. I got it. I got it Mama! I got it. The lease! Detroit. Burger location in Midtown. Let me tell you something Mama, I even got a contract that's ready to start right away now it's a little bit more money than I want to spend. But, I'm doing it, Mom. - Oh. - I'm doing it. Congratulations, baby. That's it? Police took Ella in for questioning. All right. It's cause of me, I made her look guilty on TV. Because of you nothing! She look guilty, Mama because she ain't got no alibi. She was at Khalil's. He'll vouch for her. Of course he did. He into her. People lie all the time. I told you Auntie B bakes when she's stressed. We got something to show y'all. Tasha pie's not the same without you. - So good to see you here. - Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, next. People have to remember that things get edited. Camera angles make things look a certain way. But I never thought that Ella robbed me. And to be extra clear, I want you all to know when I retire, Ella is getting her mama's share of the bakery. Same as Gabe. Equal partners. So maybe now, you'll share your mama's recipe with me. Maybe. And, cut! Ella, she's just told you you're getting half the business. How does that make you feel? Uh, good. Perfect. Gabe! Why you got to go in there and say something like that on TV. You already knew. That's private family stuff, Mama. Jesus, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. I do not understand why she gets half. She's getting the half that would have belonged to your sister. But my... My sister is not here. I am! I'm the one that put all the hustle in. It wouldn't even be no TV show if it weren't for me. You don't even know nothing about YouTube. It's not about the TV show! - Mama, listen. - It's about the bakery. All my recipes, I developed them with Tasha. And who stayed with you every night and every weekend while I was out building the business? Your sister! And then she was gone. After you sent her to that fancy school. Then who stayed with me, Mom? Not you. Not Tasha. Surely not Ella. Every night. Every weekend. - Alone. - Well, I wasn't partying. - I was working! - To an 11 year old, it don't mean nothin', Mama if you not there. Oh, oh, well, what about the car you stole and wrecked. Who bailed you out? And what about the drugs you got caught selling that school? You only notice me when I'm in trouble. That's it. Probably because you don't want it to blow back on you. You can lock it in a safe, scream it to the mountaintop. Ella is getting half. Okay. Ella getting half. We're going to see. And your boyfriend? He's good? Yeah. Things a'ight What is it sweetheart? Pop's. I still want to come home. Why? What do you got here? You. I miss you too. But in Chicago you got a, you got a job, a boyfriend, a life. Besides the deal is you stay there. Yeah, but here I always got to be on. At work or even just out. People watch the show, know who I am, or think they do online too. That's because you making something out yourself. Then the robbery? They thought I did it, Pops. Yeah, but not anymore. Someone was out here trying to frame me. Ella, you home? Look, I got to go Pops. - Bye, I love you. - I love you, too. I have something for you. Designers sometimes send me free clothes, hoping I'll rock it on the show. This came for you. Rock it? Rock it, or whatever you kids say. Oh, wow. Okay. Oh, you have to post that on our official account when you wear it. Maybe on a date with Khalil. So you still thinking about going back to Texas, huh? I overheard your conversation with your dad. Don't go, Ella. I'm scared to stay in this house by myself. Shanice changed the security. Yeah, but I, I'm scared of losing the show, losing my business. What are you talking about? Well, they were going to cancel the show, but since you've been here, we've got a new audience and a younger demographic and everything about you and Khalil breaks the Internet. Oh, me and Kim Kardashian, huh? And Gabe's Detroit branch. First he needed $100,000, then he needed $200,000, and I had to remortgage the house. Really? The cancer treatment is expensive, and my insurance don't cover everything. But I think it's going to be okay. But I like having you here. I don't want you to go. I won't make you stay. It's your choice. Hello? Yo, Ella, you get my note? Who is this? The big bad wolf. Don't go back to Grandma's. Just get in your blue ride and drive back to Texas. Hey E. We got something from the night of the burglary. A little Camaro. Could be charger. No, it's a Camaro. - You always think Gabe's right. - Because it's true. I know someone down at the DMV. Maybe she can help us out. I've got a friend as a cop, you know. I can get him to run it through. I'm thirsty. - Anyone want a drink? - Yeah. Yeah. Run it back, Mom. Okay. You okay? Someone went into my locker and put this in my pocket. Then right when I got here, I got a phone call from this number. They knew I was walking into Birdie's and what car I was driving and want me to go home. Okay, I'll follow up on this. Okay. That dress is fire! Thank you. Yo, excuse me. Ella. Hi. So sorry. You mind if I get a photo? I'm a huge fan. Yeah, yeah. Okay. There you go. Thank you. Where did you park? Just over there. Free parking. - What does that mean? - Nothing. Can you turn that thing off? 3,000 likes? Who cares? I do. When did you become this person? Likes, views, non-stop selfies. It's for the business. Okay. Birdie asked me to. She not here. Can't it just be me and you? I liked it better when you thought all this was a joke. Come on. Move. What is it? I think there's someone following us. What? It was a guy in a black hoodie. So, like half of Chicago. - Look. - No one's there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She's fine. Thanks, everyone. Is that girl from that bakery show? Who almost got killed. Khalil, Khalil, we should just call the police, okay? And tell them what? Someone was following us and they had a gun. I get it. So much has been going on. Stress can make you see things. Wow. You didn't. You didn't just say I am too stressed to know what my own eyes saw. I'm just saying I didn't see someone with a gun. Just stop, okay? Stop. I know what I saw. You know what? What are you doing? Calling an Uber. Just come on, I'll drive you. No, no, thanks. I don't need anything from you. In fact, why don't we take a break? - Ella, stop acting crazy. - Stop acting stupid. These are pretty drawings. But when's it opening? A couple weeks. I believe you said that two weeks ago. I know my Mama. In the meantime, I'm paying interest on the mortgage I took out for you. I cannot control the supply chain. Oh you're gonna want to keep the cameras rolling for this. I ain't got time for this today! You better take a good look at your son! Because unless I get every cent I am owed, you won't be seeing him for a while. What? He just paid you. I know because I gave him the money. - I haven't seen a dime. - Turn it off. Turn it off! - Gabe, stop this! - Turn it off! Sit your narrow ass down Khalil! Anybody else? Y'all got Gabe twisted up in here! Stay right here for a second. I'm gonna get some ice. He do this every single time. Uncle Gabe, wait! - Wait! - I'm not going back up in there! Everybody in there want to humiliate me? Look, I just want to see if you're okay. - You going? - Where are we going? To turn up. Get in the truck. It's awesome Uncle, it's real nice. - You like it? - Yeah. Hey, hey! What's good, what's good? What's going on player? Come on now. Give it to me. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm good. Oh, hey, now take care of my niece for a minute. I'm gonna get a drink. I need a drink. Okay. Hey shorty. - Come join. - Okay. This place is incredible. Thank you. To you, looking, oh so fine. Even in that outfit. Oh, I can't tell are you a good girl or a bad one. Guess we'll have to wait and see. Now where were we? Hey! Button your shirt up! - My shirt's good, man. - Hey, move back. You ain't kissing my niece. She grown. - She can make up her own mind. - Yeah, Uncle Gabe. You ain't kissing my neice and she's moving back to Texas. Actually, I'm staying here. Birdie asked me to and I like Chicago and soon you'll be in Detroit. So I'm going to have a bakery to run. To Ella staying. In the Chi. Where you at girl? Look, I really want to go home. I'm 5 minutes away. Alone. Hey, rise and shine. How's your head? It's not good. Oh, well, don't party with Gabe and Caleb. You can't afford it in every way. Well Gabe practically lives there popping $220 champagne bottles. But he can't pay Larissa. Ah, player gonna play. Look what I found on the internet. Also found this. It's the hoodie. So I wasn't crazy. Someone was after me. You're not crazy. I'm going to take care of this. Going to make some calls. Thanks, Shan. Yeah. Shanice showed me everything. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I feel like an idiot. You know I miss you right? I'm crazy about you. You are? But, when we met, you were someone who lived by your own rules. Now it's all about likes, ratings, influence. There's so much pressure. The show, the new location, Birdie's not as rich as she acts. I got caught up in it. And I'm sorry. Here you go. All right. Here you go. No, no. She ordered T-Pie not pecan. You better get it together, girl. Ain't gonna be around here too much longer. Gabe is my son. He's been through his ups and downs, but I believe in him. He needs to do some growing on his own. And this is a good opportunity. As long as you don't bankrupt us. Having this time with Ella has been precious and healing. Like time with my sister that I never got. And I know Uncle Gabe is going to kill it in Detroit because he better. Because if he loses, half my inheritance, I'm a kill him. And, cut! Hey, I'm just grabbing food for everybody. I just want to know if you wanted any wraps. Do you want any? - Yeah, I could eat. Thank you. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. You good? Yeah, mhhm. Y'all back on? - Think so. - Serious? I think so. All right, good. Good, because for a minute I thought was going to be another notch on Khalil's belt. That ain't good. Hey, listen, I got a nurse gonna call you about a new health insurance. All right? It's for all the Birdie's Bakes employees, it's a new coverage. It's better, especially for my Mama covers more of her expenses Um, she, she called. - Okay. - I'll get back to her soon. All right. Make sure you stay on top of it. I will, I will. Watch out for that boy. I don't know if I like him yet. Okay, so your mother died of pancreatic cancer at 28 years of age? Mhhm. Almost done. And you have no other health concerns except the anaphylactic nut allergy? Uh, right. Blood pressure. Good. You're going to do me next. What was your name again? Birdie Moore. Uh, no. Only person I got here is Gabriella Boudreaux. So you're going to take blood for health insurance? It's for her life insurance. Also with Clarity Vista. Just killing two birds with one stone. But I never signed up for life insurance. Oh, that's on Mr. Moore again. He wanted everyone's families to be protected just in case. Can I see this policy? Sure. Well, it says here that Gabe's the only beneficiary. That's the default because he set it up. You can call the office to have it changed. Just a little prick. Now, I know you all are dying to get home, but we got to talk security. This car was seen outside of Aunit Birdie's house the night she was robbed. Here it is again outside of Birdie's Bakes. Three weeks after the burglary. Whoever it is, did not get what they want yet and they haven't given up. So just keep your eyes open. You ever hear back from your cop friends about the car? Oh. No, no, no. They, they couldn't do nothing with a partial. The driver of the car is this woman. Also a woman contacted Ella and left threatening messages. Everyone, vigilance, please. So with this technology, you could listen in on me and activate my camera whenever you want? I do not want to see or hear anything that you are doing. This is for emergency situations only. I did it for Auntie B too. And Gabe? Gabe refused. This is just until we can catch whoever is targeting this family. Mama. - Yeah? Yep - You good? But all this security stuff? I know, I know, I know. How you getting home? Ella and Kahlil, they got me. Okay. Hey, look, I'm, I'm going out with some friends, okay? Okay, but you be careful always. I always am. - I love you. - Love you too. What? - What? - Hey, baby. Show daddy what it do. Come here. I'm better now. Yeah? All right, get in the car I need to talk to you. Okay. All right, baby. Looks like you got to get yourself a new car. The locations not ready to shoot. If my son says it's ready. It is. And if there's a little mess, work that movie magic, set dec. The production manager says it's an active construction zone and it's not safe to have crew there. Crews shoot in war zones! Y'all can't handle a little sawdust? Maybe I won't be leaving after all. Oh come on, you know who's going to win that fight. - But I'm going to miss you. - Me too. I'm only going to Detroit. It's going to be okay. Yeah but whoever it is is still out there. Yeah. Why don't you come with me to Detroit. And leave Birdie alone? I think Birdie will be just fine. What? Really? Is she trippin'? Sorry. Oh, she's been off her game all day. She's love lovesick. This ain't gonna work. Get off the phone. I got to go, babe. Who's going to pay for that dropped pie? It's coming out of your salary. - It was Khalil. - Obviously. It sounded bad, okay. Like nothing is ready. They're having a hard time shooting in Detroit. You know what? Let's go to Detroit and give our family some support. No, no, no, no. I'll keep it. Keep it a surprise. We're going to Detroit. - Bye. - Okay. This place is a real score. We got the best bakers, bar none. Sorry, Mama, but here at Birdie's Bakes in Detroit. Yessir. Let me tell you something, I even stole the legendary doc out of Chicago and I didn't think I could get doc. But then I found out there was... Cut! Cut, cut. I could see the tool belt on the... - Come on, Zoe. - There's no place to shoot. Ovens don't even work. None of this is real. I know, I know. We'll just shoot it from the counter. Okay, everybody, let's just reset. Birdie, I don't know about all this. Oh, no, no, no, don't. Let's. Let's go look around in the kitchen. Come on. Come on, Zoe. Mom! Hey, hey, hey, look, look. It looks worse than what it is, okay? Here, let me let me let me show you around. Now, listen up. I got, I got, I got two full time bakers, all right? I got one part time, two on the counter, and me. That's a whole lot of staff before you even make a penny. Player don't need it, Mama. Sure bought top of the line. Only the best. Spending my money on $10,000 ovens!? With what you need, you could have bought one - for half that. - This is my place. - It's my money. - This place represents me. I don't want to cheap out. - I want it class. - What? As opposed to me? You've been handed everything your whole life. Now free ain't good for you. You have to do shiny too. You think you're so generous? - I do. - Everything you done for me is guilt money and you know it. You don't get to talk, you just got here. You be quiet when grown folks talking, everything she gave you is guilt money, too. She just gave you half the brand I built. Gabe! Her Mama's dead. But your mama has been propping your ass up all your life! I'm not going to give you one more red cent. If he pick this up, I will kill you. - Gabe, no. - Get off me! This is my bakery. Detroit belongs to me! Nobody else ought to come down here. No way. Y'all can go back to Chicago. Ain't nobody else gonna come down here. Hey, so, all sorted, Check out tomorrow at 11. Thank you. Thank you. Look, it'll all blow over. Y'all are a team. Gabe's place is a disaster. They tried to tell me and I didn't believe. But it's even worse than what they said. Oh, it just needs time and TLC. And lots of money. And I'm clean out. I've been sweeping up behind that boy so long he has no idea how to clean up his own messes. You wanted the best for him. I wanted what was easiest. When Gabe was born, your mama was ten years old. She made Gabe her little doll. I was busy building the business. And Gabe's father and I were going through some tough times. She, she never let that baby cry She slept beside him all night. And when he was a little toddler and scraped his knee. He didn't come to me. He went to Tasha. I saw little things, lying and bullying, but Tasha. She only saw the good in Gabe, and she drew it out of him. And when Tasha left, the light in Gabe was dimmed, and he started doing little things, you know, bullying and teasing. And he stole a car in high school. And I knew I was working too much. But instead of working less, I covered it up. I enabled him. I, I thought it was a phase. A prank, a stage. Look, whatever you did or didn't do, Gabe is an adult. He makes his own choices. I kept my son a child. Oh God, forgive me. My man. My man, thanks for hanging back to talk. - You all right? - Yeah, no problem. All right. You want a drink or something? I got some stash around here. - Thanks. - I'll hook it up. About earlier, with Ella. You ain't like the way I was talking to her, did you? So you know what, I think my niece would be gone by now if it wasn't for your pretty ass. Because you know what? You part of the problem. What's wrong? Huh? You're weak! You're in my life! What's wrong, pretty boy? Ain't nobody standing in the way of mine. You hear me? Nobody. Hello? Khalil? - Hey, niece. - Hey. Khalil here? He, he texted me to come pick him up. Car trouble, right? Oh, yeah, he's all right. Well, listen, since I got you here, I would love to get your opinion on my Tasha Pie. Yeah, yeah, sure. All right, all right. Come on, come on, come on, come on. I think you're going to like it. I think I made it just right. Oh, yeah. Come on in here. Hey, Birdie. Don't you have one of those spy things on Ella's phone? - Yeah. - Well she went to pick up Khalil a long time ago. And she's not answering. Okay, I'm putting you on speaker. Her phone must be lying down. All I can see is a ceiling, wires. No, that's, that's Gabe's bakery. I'm gonna have some pie with you. Come on. - Grab a seat. - Oh, my God, Gabe. What have you done? If I were you, I would just eat your pie and you'll be fine. We lost her. Oh, no, I'm leaving right now. Okay, keep your phone on. Come on, eat up. What you think? Delicious. It's good you got that recipe right? Birdie always thought she nailed it, but your mama was always a better baker, better cook, better mother. I miss Tasha's food. I miss everything about Tasha. It was just me and Birdie. And then really, it was just me. Because Birdie was always gone. Your mom ever bake you a spaghetti pie? Mhhm. When she was sick because she made me extra so I'd have one on my seventh birthday. After she died. She ever talk about me? Lots. How I was named after you. It means God is my strength. When you first came here, I wanted to hate you. Yeah. And I liked you. You look just like her. I like you too, Unc. I wanted you to go back to Texas, and I don't want to hurt you. But you're doing it again. This time you're doing it with Birdie. Taking my place, my company. I can't fail. I can't lose it all again. I never wanted them to hurt Birdie. I just wanted control of the business. I need money. - The insurance. - The original recipe was always pecan to the crust. She changed it because of you. Looking for this? Oh my God. Gabriel Marcus Moore. What in God's green earth are you doing? Give her her EpiPen. I can't Mama. I can't let her mess it up for me again. This child has done nothing to you. Cause of her I lost Tasha, and now I'm about to lose my company. - Lose your company? - You trying to give her half! I'm the one that took Tasha from you. If you want to blame it on somebody, blame it on me. In a way I am. Because no matter what I do, you always try to cover it up. You always have. You were too proud to let the world know you got a messed up, son. I am proud. I've been proud my whole life. They stopped me from seeing what's before my very eyes. Who's a punk now? Here, here, here. Stay right there. She okay? Tell me she's okay. It's supposed to be mine! - I got you. I got you. - Don't you move! You've given her everything! I got you, Ella. I got you. This is the last time we're going to do this. But I wanted to come and share some news. I'm in remission, and although I feel blessed, I now understand how my daughter Tasha had felt when she was dying and my, and my battle with cancer. I had my family around me, including my beloved grand daughter, Ella. So, it's hard for me to understand why I couldn't swallow my pride and be there for my precious Tasha. Oh, Lord, help me That's something I'll always regret. She was my baby. Flight 174. Hi. How's it going? Grandma, you're supposed to be celebrating your remission. This is your first vacation in 20 years. More like 30, but... All the more reason, go enjoy. I will, but just let me have a look. Fine, y'all. It's Grandma. Hi, Auntie B. - Hey Birdie - Hi, Joe. You keeping those girls in check? No I don't mess with these girls. - You run a tight ship. - College application. Has she heard back? I'm standing right here and yes, I heard back. And? I'm in! Oh I am so happy to hear that. What is it, Grandma? I'm still not used to not being able to share all my news with him. He still won't see you? He won't even put me on the visitor's list. Um, okay, well, his sentencing is soon. You're going to be there testifying for him, asking for a lighter sentence. Maybe after that. I don't know. You got one more week there. You check in again on us and I'm not going to pick up. I can't help it and you think you're going to go to L.A. and not call? No. Nope, nope, nope, nope. I'm going to spend time with my boo. Khalil did say that there be a Birdie's Bakes West Coast. You get your degree, and then we can talk about Birdie's Bakes in L.A.. Okay, I'm hanging up now. I love you, Ella. I love you, too. Joe, you eat any more of that pie, We're going to dock your pay. Every time I taste this, it's like an extra minute with my Tasha. Honey, you did this right. You eat all the pie you want. I'm going to. Welcome to Birdie's Bakes. What can I get you? I'm feeling the love. Let me get one of those Tasha Pies.
