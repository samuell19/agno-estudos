- Perfect. - OK, don't you think he's getting a bit old for balloons? - We always get balloons. - Well, maybe it's time to start a new tradition - like not going. - Don't start! - Seriously, Paige, after everything he's put us through, put Mom through... - It's one day a year, Tayler. - Well, it's one day too many. - You're so selfish. - You are just so perfect. Perfect Paige... - Better than slutty Tayler. - I'm not the one who was banging a married guy. - Shut up, Tayler. - Old married guy... - Shut your mouth! - But it's OK, 'cause we were in love! - SHUT UP! - What?

How have you been? - I've been great. Actually. Really great. - Dad! - Dad! Are you nuts? You're going to blow us all up! - Relax! I turn this off first. - So... You said on the phone you got a job? - Oh, yeah! Yeah, actually, better than a job. Much better. - What is it? - This is my newest venture, selling high-yield securities. Now, this company, they develop new apps for cell phones. - Dad, I don't recognize any of these. - Well, that's because they're still in development, honey, but you'll see them soon. - Really, Dad? Another Ponzi scheme? Do you want to go back to prison? - This is different. - Do you mean legal? - Yes, 100 per cent legal. These tech guys are the real deal. They used to work for Google. - Well, that does sound promising. - Right? - We just need a little bit of seed money. - Are you... Are you asking us for money? - Just a few grand. - A few grand? Do you have any idea w much it's costing us to send your favourite daughter here to med school? - Tayler, don't! - We've been busting our asses off for years just to get by with no help from you. - Yeah, well, it's been a little tough for me to get back on my feet, too. OK, but this opportunity... - Stop! Don't try and sell us, 'cause we're not buying! - Look, I know I haven't been the best father. - Ha! You think? - Will you stop? I just feel at this stage in my life I can make things better. - Dad, if I could help you, I would. But we really are strapped right now, and... - It's just a few grand. It's OK. It's alright. I'll figure something out. - Unbelievable! - He's doing the best he can. - That's what Mom used to say. Look where it got her. - Do you know, you can be such a bitch sometimes. - I'm being real. You should try it sometime. Paige... - DAD! - Any idea what made him do it? - No one left to lie to. - Your sister... She's OK? - She goes away like that sometimes. - Her happy place. - I don't think she has one. - And... the phone bill. Do we have enough left for Dad's funeral? - Barely. - Son of a bitch got our money after all. - Maybe if we would have given it to him in the first place... - Don't start. - We were all he had left! - Paige... All he ever cared about was himself. - Yeah, he made some mistakes... - NO! He was a selfish prick, period! Keep making him into something he isn't, you'll end up with someone just like him. - I'm sorry I'm late everyone, You know how it is, first day of school... I am Lucas Emery, and I'm new. Well, I've been a surgeon for 20 years, but this is my first foray into teaching, so let's all hope we survive the operation. So, it's a pretty small class, why don't we actually get to know each other here. Anyone want to start? ...Yes. - I'll start. My name's Craig Stelter, I'm from Gainesville, Florida, and I want to specialize in neurosurgery. - Go Gators! Anyone else? Yes. - Hi, I'm Jenny, and, um, since I never became a psychic, I want to go into neurosurgery. - Who else? Anyone? - Hi. - Yes. - I am Paige... York, Paige York, and I'm from here - Philly. And... ...my focus is psychiatry. - So I'm going to have to watch my Freudian slips with you, then. Who else? - Hi... - Yes? - Um, I'm Lara, and I was always fascinated... Lord, we commend your son, Cameron York, into your loving arms.

I still don't know what you said to them to convince them I'm the man for the job, but... - Easy. Lied my ass off. How's Gabby doing? - Uh... Hanging in there. Actually, I have to make some calls, I need to get someone to help out part-time. - Hey, uh, you know, the university, they have this in-house employment program. You could get a med student for half of what you pay through a nursing service, if that works for you. - So what do I have to do? - Nothing. I'll handle it. I'll get you a shortlist of potential candidates that you can interview. - Thank you. - Hey, anything for you, Dean. - Hmm. ...as I'm sure you'll remember from the previous example. Now, in some extreme cases, the... - Sorry, Dr. Emery, to interrupt. I am never late. - Well, happens to the best of us, just make sure it doesn't happen in surgery. Alright, as I was saying, in some extreme cases... - I wanted to apologize again for interrupting class. - Oh, you more than made up for it with your questions and comments. You're smart. - You think so? - You don't? - I mean, this stuff does not come easy to me. I've never been at the top of my class. I have to work twice as hard as everyone else just to keep up. - Well, if it helps, I was at the top of my class and I felt the same way - still do sometimes. - Well, look, as far as being late goes, won't happen again. - Appreciate it. - I had to go to my father's funeral. - Oh... I'm sorry. - It was a blessing. - Was he ill? - He was, but he's in a better place now. Uh, I'm sorry... Hey, there. OK... No, I'm leaving now. - Is everything alright? - It's my wife, I gotta go. Gabby? - I'm here. - Gabby? - In the kitchen. - What the hell? - I'm fine. - Hey - what happened? - I was making banana bread. I wanted to surprise you. - Mission accomplished. - I was just reaching for the bananas, and I... I fell. - Yeah. Here. Sure you're not hurt? Here. - No... Ow! - I got ya. - Just, uh... Just my pride. - OK. Gabby... You know how much I support you on what you're going through, but, uh... - I know. I know. I can't be alone. I just want to finish what I started, OK? - Come on, Tayler. Just give me the keys, I'm going to be late for class. - Come on, one for the road. - Technically, that's two. - To us! You know what, you need to learn to lighten up, have a little fun. In case you haven't noticed, life is short. - I don't need to make it any shorter by drinking and driving. - Fair enough. - You can't just work all the time. - I know. I know. - What's the food colouring for? - You'll see, you'll see. OK, look. The dish soap, it's bipolar. It weakens the chemical bonds that holds the proteins and the fats in solution. Observe... - Cool! - Huh? - Dad... - Yeah? - Is Mom ever going to get better? - Well, I certainly hope so. - But she might not. - Yeah, that's right. - And she might get worse. - You know what, I... I try not to worry too much about worst-case scenarios. - Hey! - Hello! Well, I hope you two saved some of that milk... ...for this. - Banana bread! Sweet! I'll take this piece... - Beautiful house, Lucas. - OK, I don't mind you having a few belts at work, but you're out of control! "Out of control"... - Hey, you tell your sister when she sobers up, if she sobers up, this happens again she's fired. - I understand. Come on, Paige, let's turn up! - Let's go. - 'Night, Mom. - Good night. Perfect. God, Holt-Sanders is boring. Think I'm going to need a caffeine-4 pill to make it through that class. - Well, they can't all be Dr. Emery. - I like Emery, alright, but he's a little... unorthodox. - I think he's amazing. - You know his wife has MS? She's in a wheelchair. Wow! Must be tough. - How do you know that? - Oh, my roommate is looking for a job. Apparently, he posted one for a part-time nurse. - There are some great candidates here, so just check out some resumes... - You know, I trust you, if you can just narrow it down to three and set up some interviews for later today, it would... - Yeah, sure. What's the hurry? - Just we had an incident yesterday. I found Gabby on the kitchen floor. - Oh, God... - No, no, she's fine, I'm just becoming a little unravelled. - Yeah. Look, uh... I'm on this. How's 5 o'clock in the conference room? - That'd be great. Thank you, yeah. - Thanks, I'll, uh, be in touch. Paige... - Hi! - What are you doing here? - The employment centre emailed me, I have an appointment. - You're not on my list... - There must be some mistake. - That was my last appointment. I don't have your résumé, so... - Oh! Well, I have a hard copy right here... - Huh! - Sorry about the confusion, I really don't know what happened, but I really do have an appointment, and I really need the job... - OK, I guess one more won't hurt. Come on. You weren't kidding about working twice as hard as others. This is quite the employment record you've managed. And for a med student... - Yeah, I didn't really have a choice. I didn't have the grades for a scholarship, and my family - well, they couldn't help. - Paige, tell me: why are you the right person for this job? - Well, uh... I took care of my mother full-time before she died. - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, you told me about your dad, but... - It's OK, it was a long time ago. - Was she ill too, or... - Sort of. Uh... We had some difficulties. She couldn't really cope, turned to drugs. ...Mom? It's actually, uh, why I wanted to become a psychiatrist - to help people help themselves. - That's commendable. - Um, also, I've been taking care of my sister basically my whole life. - Uh, your sister... - Oh, she's not sick or anything, she's just not very good at taking care of herself. - Hmm. I see. - Look, Dr. Emery, I'm sure these other applicants are just as qualified as I am, if not more, but I can promise you that I will treat your wife as if she were my own family. - I'm convinced. But the final choice is Gabby's, OK? - I can't wait to meet her. - You don't have to. I gotta clear some stuff up at the office; can you be at my house at 8 o'clock? - Yeah, sure. OK. Thanks! - Just put your number in here, I'll text you the address. - I've been trying to call you! - I'm a little busy here. - Yeah, well... Need your car. - Car's all yours. - Thanks! I gotta change. - Where you going? Hot date? - No, I got a job. - What? You didn't have to do that. We can manage. - I'm tired of managing. I want a real life. So then the mom says to the son, but you're only 23! - You didn't tell me she was funny, too. - I did not know. So I... guess that you approve then? I do. - Well, Paige, um, could you lift Gabby if you had to? - Honey! She won't have to. - I know, I'm just saying, if she had to... - It's OK, I totally can. I am a lot stronger than I look. - What's all the ruckus? - Amy, this is Paige, she's going to be helping your mom part-time. - Hi, Amy! It's nice to meet you. - Hi. Mom, can I have a piece of cake before bed? - Sure, sweetheart. - So, um... I guess you can start tomorrow? - Perfect! - Can you keep it down? My head is killing me right now. - Oh, I'm sorry, is my cleaning up your mess disturbing you? - Nobody asked you to clean up. - What, were you gonna do it? - Eventually. - Really, Tayler? - Really, Paige. - You know, you can't just keep partying 24/7. - Watch me. - You're going to end up like Mom. - Not likely. I have better taste in men. - That's a pump. You can understand the mechanics of it, but did you know in ancient Egypt the heart was seen as the centre of life and morality? In Egyptian mythology after death, your heart was taken to the hall of Maat, the goddess of justice, to be weighed against the feather of Maat. Now, if your heart was lighter than that feather... You got this - one more step! - I got a couple more in me. - Alright... Oh, nice! Oh! - Ugh... Damn it! - It's OK, I got you. There you go... - All this work for what, in case a miracle happens? - You can't think like that. - No. What I can't do is lie to myself anymore. I've had this disease my whole life. The fact that it's been in remission this long - that's the miracle. There's no way I'm going to get another one. I'm sorry, Paige, you don't need to hear this. - I don't mind. I just wish there was something I could do to help. - Well, you could make me a drink. Ha! - One iced tea coming up. - Yeah, I was thinking of something a little stronger. - It's ready! - Wow, look at that! Thank you. Aren't you going to have one? - I'm at work. - Oh, come on! I do not mind. You know, Lucas's birthday is coming up soon. You might have to mix a batch of these up. - I'd be happy to. - He's just been so great about everything. I'd really like to make it special/ - We can do that. - We spent our honeymoon in Cabo. We drank a lot of these babies. - That sounds nice. - Mm... Surfing, rock climbing, mountain biking, other... activities... None of which I can do anymore. There I go, feeling sorry for myself. Not attractive! Where's Paige? - Oh, I don't know, she said she had to go to the bathroom, but that was a little while ago. Paige! - Oh, and Paige showed me this game that you play, and I think Amy's going to love it. You're going to love it! - Paige? - How was your day? - Oh, the kids are so young! It's demoralizing. Hey! - Oh, there she is! - Um... I wasn't feeling too well. I feel better now, though. - Huh! You hardly had anything to drink. - Was it something you ate? - I'm fine. Um... I really should get going. - OK. - Thanks again! - No! - ♪ Let the waves ♪ Wash over ♪ Can't find a reason - Paige... - Hey... You want to tell me what the hell you were trying to do? - I wasn't trying to kill myself, Paige. - You took almost the whole bottle! - I got wasted at work again and Jerry fired me. So then I went out and I got more wasted, and then I... Oh, my God, I barely remember driving home. And then it was just so late and then I couldn't sleep and then I just couldn't make my mind stop. - This can't happen again, Tayler, I, I can't... - I know. - I'm going to turn my life around, OK? I promise. OK? - Iced tea? - Oh, I was hoping for another margarita. - We'll wait 'til the birthday boy gets here for that. Whoa - are you OK? - Yeah, I don't have much feeling on the whole left side of my body. My arm, my leg... Well, I guess we should get dinner started. - I'll get that started. Why don't you just enjoy your iced tea? I found a perfect gift for Dad. - Uh, your mom is just napping, sweetheart. - Mom never naps. - Well, there's a first time for everything. Oh, what did you get him? - A Cortès print. It's his favourite artist. - Oh, ha ha! Uh, he'll love it! Uh, so do you have any homework? - Tons! - Alright, well you let me know if you need any help, I'll just be making your dad's birthday dinner. Perfect. So are you going to be a doctor like your dad? - I don't know, maybe. You are, though, right? - That's the plan. - That's pretty awesome. - You're pretty awesome. - You should probably wake up Mom. - Let's let her rest a little bit longer. Paige, this looks amazing. - All of your favourites. - I tried to wake Gabby but she's really out. - Yeah... She's been pretty tired lately. - Is she getting worse? - No, honey... - No, fatigue is a symptom of MS. She'll be fine. - Well, uh... I'll let you enjoy your dinner. - You're not leaving! We can't eat this all by ourselves. - You'll have leftovers. - No, no buts. I insist. Come on, it's my birthday! - It's just a print. A painting was a little out of my price range. - Yeah, mine too. Thank you. - I got you a little something as well. - Oh, no, no, no - you didn't have to. - Open it! - Alright. - It was my grandfather's. - This is too much. - Lucas, no other professor has opened my eyes the way you have. The way you explain things, the depth, the insight... You really have inspired me. - Look, it's only been a few classes, so... - Dad doesn't do well with compliments. Try it on! - Alright... - Look at that, fits perfectly. Know what? I'm going to wear this to some special occasion. - Paige... - What the hell? - I can't sleep. What are you doing? - Studying. - At one in the morning? - I guess I lost track of time. - I got a job interview tomorrow. - That's quick. - Yeah. Told you, I'm going to get my life together. - Guess you better get some rest, then. - OK, I'll try. Goodnight, kid. - It's just so right when we're together. I know he loves me. I can see it in his eyes. - It's like the Pentagon up in here. The procedure we will be performing is coronary artery bypass grafng. And when angioplasty proves insufficient, we take a healthy vein or artery from another part of the body and we graft it in place of the blocked artery, OK? Everybody pay close attention. No flash photography. Scalpel. Now, before we perform the graft, we will be injecting potassium chloride to stop the heart from beating - temporarily, of course. - I wanted to thank you for making dinner last night. - I was happy to do it. - I can't believe I missed his birthday. I've just never crashed that hard before. - I'm sure he understands. Well, I'm just going to make us some iced tea. Now, before we perform the graft, we will be injecting potassium chloride to stop the heart from beating - temporarily, of course. To stop the heart from beating... - Have a good night. - Hey. - You're home late. - I was called in to an emergency bypass. - Saving lives again? - Fortunately yes. Um... Where's Gabby? - She fell asleep. I put her to bed. I'm actually getting kind of worried about her. - How come? - She's, uh... ...hasn't been doing so well lately. Getting tired all the time, difficulty breathing... - She hasn't said anything to me. - She probably doesn't want to worry you. - Right. - Amy's asleep, I'll heat up your dinner. - No, I'm... I'm not hungry. - A drink then? - No, I'm just gonna get changed, just go for a run. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Lucas. - Ah! - Hi! - Hey! What are you doing here? - I just forgot to thank you for yesterday - for taking us into surgery. - Oh! I hope it was helpful. Oh, actually, Paige, I meant to call you, um... I'm leaving early, so we don't need you tonight. - OK... I'll see you tomorrow, then. - Alright. - What's the big rush? - I'm seeing someone. - Dressed like that? - Just give me the keys. Thank you. - Whoa! Who's the guy? - I will tell you that when I'm ready. - I'm doing great! - Thanks for asng. - Oh, I'm beat! I'll see you tomorrow morning. - I'm going for a run. - OK. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? - I'll take real good care of Lucas... ...and Amy. So don't you worry. - Dad? - Yup? - Have you seen my calculator? I have a test today. - Yes, on my desk, study, in the top left-hand drawer. - Cool, thanks. Mom's sure been sleeping a lot. Gabby? Honey? - Uh... 911, what's your emergency? - Hey, uh... This is, uh... It's Dr. Lucas Emery, and... - How can I help you, sir? - My wife is dead. - OK, I'm sending someone right away. - Morning, sis! Hope you're hungry. - Aw, thanks! I have to dine and dash, though, I got that job. - Oh, yay! Good for you! - Mm. I want to hear all about that guy later. - You will. We're going to be seeing a lot more of each other. Since the first moment that I met Gabby, I have... I have been completely in awe of her. She is... She is thoughtful, uh, caring, dynamic, smart as hell... She was funny. And her, uh... Her passion for life was... It was inspiring. She always put all of herself into everything that she did, whether it was being a lawyer, or my wife, or mother to our daughter, Amy, or, uh, just a friend. She made everyone feel like they were the most important person in her world, and she made me feel that way every day of our lives together. And I will hold onto that, to her love, for the rest of my life. - I love you, Grandma. - I love you too, dear. - Amy... - Thank you for everything, Paige. - Of course. - You know, I was thinking, you're dealing with so much right now, if I could stay on, help out with Amy... - That's very thoughtful, but... - Dad, can't she? Please? - Sure, uh, just for now, until I figure things out, OK?

So are you. What's wrong? - I'm just having fun today. - Isn't that the idea? - Yeah, just... It feels wrong somehow without Gabby. - I think she'd want you to have fun, to be happy. - I know. - Look, I know it's not the same thing, but when my mom died, it just felt like my whole world had exploded. You know, there was nothing but darkness. I lived in that darkness for a long time. Too long. And the only way I was able to get out of it was to let her go. Not her memory or the love we had, but just her presence. I had to get used to her not being there with me. - How did you do that? - By letting others in. I'm going to see you at school? - Right. Come on, Lucas. What are you waiting for? - Hey. Look, I'm sculpting again. - I can see that. - So how was your date? - Fine. - Come on, I want details! - I'm tired, alright? - You've been seeing this guy for a while now, I still don't know anything about him. - Look, you weren't so interested in my life before you quit drinking. - Yeah, well maybe that's true, but I am interested, OK?

But you... - I don't need help, OK? - OK. - I really would like to know more about this new man in your life. - His name is Lucas. - Well, tell me about him. How did you guys meet? - He is a professor and a very talented surgeon. - Wait - he's your professor? Oh, Paige... - What? - How old is he? - What does it matter? - The last guy you got serious with was your undergrad bio professor and that was a disaster. - This is different. - Oh, OK, so this Lucas isn't 20 years older and married with kids? - He's a widower, and... ...he loves me. - I really hope that's true, I do. - It is. We're perfect for each other. - Hey. - Hey. Faculty meeting's in 5. - Uh... I'm sorry, I... - No, no, hey, listen, don't worry about, I'll cover for you. - No, I'm good. I'm good. - Hey... Why don't you and I go out for dinner tonight, just unwind a little? - No, I can't. Amy really needs me right now. - Lucas, you got to look after yourself too, brother. - OK, I'll check with Paige, see if she can stay with Amy. - She's still with you? - Paige? Yeah, she's...

We don't need to talk right now, just come back to bed. - No! - Lucas, I know you want this. - Paige... - You want this as badly as I do. - No, I don't.

So I checked him out. You told me he was a widower. - And he is. - His wife just died, Paige! You shouldn't be getting involved with him. What you need to do is you need to... - Don't tell me what I need to do. What I need to do, Tayler, IS TO GET YOU TO STAY OUT OF MY LIFE! - Good morning, Lucas! - OK, Paige, listen, uh... - I wanted to apologize for last night. - OK... - I thought you were ready, but I can see you need more time. - More time? - You're old-fashioned. I get it. Actually, it's... It's pretty charming. - OK, look. If I gave you the wrong idea, I apologize. I don't think of you that way. - Of course you do. You're just afraid to fall in love again... - OK, listen. If I were to ever fall in love again, it would be with someone my own age, OK? Someone I could relate to. - You can relate to me. We were meant for each other. - I don't know how else I don't want you. I never have, I never will. And I can't have you working for me, so here's what I owe you, and there's two weeks' severance. - I don't want your money! - Goodbye, Paige. Take care. - Man, I dated a girl like that once. She's tons of fun, but she's crazy as all hell. She ended up beating up my Beemer with a baseball bat. - OK, we're not dating. She's delusional. - You know what? You should file a restraining order. - No, I'm worried that might escalate things. - Escalate? She told you she was in love with you! - I made it very clear to her that the feelings aren't mutual. - I hope she got the message. - Hey, what's the protocol for this sort of thing at this school? Should I talk to the dean? - No, no, I wouldn't do that yet, but if she crosses a line again you're going to have to. - I need help. - We're getting a dog? - No. Nice try. No. I'm going to be hiring someone to help look after you. - Paige does that. - I know, but, uh, Paige isn't going to be working for us anymore. - Why not? - Look, I know how much you like her... - I love her! She's like my sister. - I know, I know, but... - I'm going to go finish this in my room. - Anything, Detective... - Cullen. - Detective Cullen. It's just I have a bad feeling. - Take your time. - Gabby, his wife, she was very sick, and, uh, Lucas and I spent a lot of time together. Anyway, um, when Gabby died, he asked me to stay on and take care of Amy. - Go on. - He would find any excuse to be alone with me, to flirt with me, I mean, God! He even gave me this. - This is, uh... ...an expensive piece. - Yeah! It was Gabby's! I mean, I should have quit right then, but Amy... She needed me. - So then what happened? - Last night, it was late, he was out, I was asleep on the sofa, and, um when I woke up, he was on top of me. He'd been, uh, drinking, and, uh, I told him to get off, but he just kept kissing me. And he said that now that Gabby was out of the way, we could... We could finally be together. And then he just started tearing at my clothes, and, and... I don't... I don't know how, but somehow I managed... I managed to get out, and, and, and I just ran... I ran out of the house as quickly as possible. - Did Amy witness any of this? - I don't know. I mean, she was sleeping. - Did he ever say anything else that would make you suspect that he killed his wife? - No, just that. Now that Gabby was out of the way. And it was the way he said it. The look in his eye. - By the way, I'm very sorry for your loss. Thank you. What's this about? - I'm confused here. Why'd you keep her on after your wife's death? - Well, to help look after my daughter. My daughter really liked Paige. - Why'd you let her go? - We had a... It was just a misunderstanding. - What kind of misunderstanding? - Sorry, why do you want to know? - Ms. York says you attacked her. - I... Attacked? - Two nights ago, in your home. - No, no, she came on to me. - Is that so? - That girl is delusional. She has this fantasy about being with me, I tried to let her down easy... - If you didn't let her down easy, how did you let her down? - Detective, I've done nothing wrong. But if you're accusing me of a crime, I want my lawyer here. - There's no autopsy on the doc's wife, but the tox screen came out clean. Cause of death was ruled a heart attack, but... - But? - You know, man. There are ways. - Like potassium chloride? - The guy is a heart surgeon. He has access and he would know just how much to use. - So it wouldn't show up on the tox screen? - Emery's wife was in a wheelchair for over a year. The prognosis wasn't good. Then this beautiful young girl comes in the picture... - You think he has it in him to kill her? - Hard to say. He did lawyer up pretty quick. I need to take a closer look at him. - This girl that's accusing him; how credible is she? - Paige York. 23-year-old med student, no record. But she's pretty enough to give a guy motive, though, that's for sure. - Subpoena the hospital's drug records, it's worth a shot. - Yes, sir. - Well, I talked to my lawyer, he says the school's within their rights to suspend me while they investigate Paige's claims. - Great. So we're all just one accusation away from losing our jobs. - Something like that. - Nice. What about the cops? What do they say? - He says they're just doing due diligence. She didn't even press charges. - What the hell's her game? - I don't know! I don't want to play it. - Dr. Emery - I have a warrant to search your home. - Let me see that. - Would you kindly step aside? - Thank you. - We're all done here. - Did you find anything? - Was there something to find? - No, I told you: she's lying. I never laid a hand on her. - Dr. Emery... If there's something you want to tell me, now would be the time. - There's nothing to tell. - Alright. We'll be in touch. - Hello? - Lucas. Hey, um... Oh, man, I don't even know how to tell you this. - Tell me what? - The police - they subpoenaed all our records. Drug inventory, everything. - So? - There's a bottle of potassium chloride that went missing from the OR the day before Gabby died. - You're not... No, no, no... - It gets worse. The log showed your key card was used, but you weren't scheduled for surgery that day. No. Gabby... - When you've lost everything, Lucas, then you'll see. You'll see what you really have. - It all fits, but it's still circumstantial as hell. - It gets deeper. I checked out the girl. About 6 years ago, she was committed to a psych ward. She was a minor, so the records were sealed. I had to get a court order. - Borderline personality disorder. She had a breakdown after her mom died. They gave her meds and released her after a few weeks. - So it could be her? - Or, they're in it together. Trouble in paradise and she turns on him. - Where's your gut in all this? - When it comes to matters of the heart, lieutenant, I stopped trusting my gut a long time ago. - Homicide. Lieutenant Davis. I'll tell him. You have a call - Dr. Emery. - Paige, what did you do? - What? - A detective called here. A homicide detective, Paige, and he was asking about you and your boyfriend and your boyfriend and... and his wife's death! Paige. Paige! Paige, what did you do? - What did you tell them? - Nothing! He asked me if I knew where you were the night she died, and I said I don't remember but I do, because that was the first night of my AA meeting and you were freaking out about using the car! And then... - Calm down! - No! And then the next morning I remember you telling me you were perfect for each other and oh, my God! You were together even before... - Tayler, Tayler... - Oh, my God! - TAYLER! - I have to go to the police station and make a statement. What am I going to say? I don't... I don't know what I'm going to tell them, this is too big! I can't lie for you... - UNH! Tayler... Tayler? Tayler? - Will your lawyer be joining us? - I know how bad this looks. I loved my wife more than anything. - In my experience, love and murder are not mutually exclusive. - It was Paige. She killed Gabby, she's trying to set me up. - Is that so? - You've got to believe me. - I'm not going to lie, Doc. You both tell a convincing story. But the only story I believe is the one the evidence tells me. - Lucas? - I need to see you. - I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. - How about my place, tonight, say, 8 o'clock. - Sounds great. I'll be there. - How long am I staying at Grandma's for? - Not long. - I still can't believe it. Paige seemed so nice. - Yeah, well... Look, honey, I am so sorry. I should never have let her into our lives. - You couldn't have known. - Look, there's your grandma. You take care, OK? - You too. - Hi! - Sorry, Tayler. You shouldn't have come between us. Long time no see. - Did you want a drink? - That would be nice. - So Amy's not here? - No, it's just the two of us. - Cheers. - Thanks for coming. - So what did you want to talk about? - The police were here. They say that Gabby was murdered and they think that I did it. - That's ridiculous. - I mean, they can't say for sure that she was murdered, but... - Do they have evidence? - Enough that my lawyer says I should be worried. - I'm so sorry, Lucas. - Cops seem to think I did it to be with you. - But you're not... ...with me. - Paige, I know what you told them, what you told the dean. It's OK, I get it. You were mad. - Why would I be mad at you. - Because I'm an idiot. Because I was so wrapped up in my own stuff that I couldn't see how good I really had it with you. You were right, Paige. You were right the whole time, I see that now. - What do you see? - I see you. I see... ...a beautiful, passionate, caring woman, someone who sees me as I truly am. No, it's too late. - What do you mean? - 'Cause barring some kind of miracle, I'm going to prison. Probably for the rest of my life. - Not if we get you out of here. - Out of here - where? - Mexico first. We can get new identities there, and then after that, we can go wherever you want. - Well, what about Amy? - What about Amy? She's young. She'll adapt. At least you'll be together. At least we'll all be together! - But you... You'll be a fugitive, you'll never be able to come back, you'll never see your family again. - I don't care! - Why would you do this after the way I treated you? - Because I would do anything for you. - I see that now. I do, I do. Gabby was suffering, Her life wasn't worth living. You ended that suffering. For her, for me... For us. - I had to. Lucas? - Paige, Paige! - Don't move! - Paige! - What did you do? - This isn't the way to play it. - I'm not playing at anything. - Paige, please. - SHUT UP! - Listen, I know you're hurting. I can help. - You just want to put me away again! - Paige, you said you loved me. - I do. - Please, put down the knife. - Come on. Put the knife down. Put the knife down. - You chose the wrong heart to break! - PAIGE! - She's losing blood, fast. - 40-16, we need an ambulance at this location. I love you, Lucas. Available ECPs to recovery. - How's it look? - Severe cerebral hypoxia, she's... She's in a coma. - You did all you could, Lucas. I don't know if I'd have done the same. - Yeah, well... - You know if she has any family left? - Both of her parents are dead. The only person she had left was her sister, Tayler. - OK, take it easy on me, I'm a bit rusty, here, so... - No way, old man! - Hold it! OK. So, how far are we going? 'Cause I'm already tired. - Uh, I don't know. Just a little ride around the block. - Yeah...
