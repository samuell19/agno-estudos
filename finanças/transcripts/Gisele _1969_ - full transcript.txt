Let me go! Stop it! We all celebrate New Year together, not in bed! Bernard, help me a moment. Grab the blanket. All together! Higher, higher! Even higher! Michel? What's the matter? - It's the gin. Come on. Come on, come and sit down. Wait a minute. Sit down. Stay here. I'll get a towel. Michel. Michel! Come on. Come on. Come on, get up. Get up. Stop it! Bernard, Michel is ill. Michel is ill. - Stop it, Michel is ill. What's the matter with him? Michel? Put him on the stool. Pick him up. Poor Michel, he's all wet. What on earth's the matter with him? Can't you see? He's blind drunk. - Jacques, get a painkiller. Your maid will be pleased. - I haven't got a maid anymore. What happened to the old girl? She caught me peeing in the wash basin. I haven't seen her since then. - You're relying on us? D'you know what? Put an ad in the paper: Maid Wanted. No, a governess. Pleasant work in a modern environment. Good salary. Perks... TO THE GOVERNESS Hello. I'm glad there is someone there. Hello, this is Michel Saint-Martin. I couldn't get home. I had an important appointment. Take no notice of the mess. My maid was taken ill just before the holiday. We don't know each other yet, but I'm sure we'll get along. Put your bags in your room on the second floor. It's the only one not in a mess. I'll be home in an hour. I'll be hungry. Make me something to eat. And make some strong coffee. If anyone else comes for the job, tell them it has been taken. We'll discuss the conditions later. Goodbye. Well! I don't believe it! Was that you on the phone? I need a mother, not a young girl. That was made clear, wasrt it? About 40 years of age. I know. I wanted to tell you on the phone but you didn't give me the chance. I'd like to look after children, but I can't see any. You don't understand. I'm the child. Has anyone else called? No. It's a misunderstanding. It doesn't matter. You've helped me out. Take this. I can't take that. - Yes, you can. Go on. Thank you. - You can go. You know the way. Goodbye. Miss! Answer that! Hello. - Leni? No. - Caroline? No, miss. This is the maid. - Michel's got a maid, everyone! Can I speak to Michel? Who is it? To whom am I talking? - To Brigitte. Tell him I'll be there earlier than planned. It's Brigitte. She says she'll be here earlier than planned. Tell her I'll be here. He'll be here. - Goodbye. Easy, isn't it? If you want to know where I am, just shout. You hear everything in this house. It's worse than a confessional. Fantastic. You're a good worker. You can go to bed now, if you want. And carry on tomorrow. Wake me at 9. Breakfast for two, coffee and rolls. Goodnight. Do you like music? Yes. Come a bit closer. Have you got a little black dress? No. - You need one. Goodnight. See you in the morning. There isn't any more ice. - Without ice then. I've brought a great record with me. We're making too much noise. - Are we? Where is your maid? - Upstairs. She's asleep. Is she as ugly as the other one? No, she's got big blue eyes and long black hair. She's extremely beautiful and walks like a queen. You're awful, Michel. Crush me. No one makes love like you. No, Michel. No, Michel. Not like that. I love you. No one makes love like you. Wake up, Brigitte. Breakfast is ready. Give me the tray. Thank you. Can you tidy up the bathroom? A roll? - Bastard! Look, I thought of you. This is a gorgeous dress. An Italian creation in jersey. A respectable little number. Note the original cut and the impeccable little white collar. How about trying it on? What do you say? - Thank you. Does it fit? It's too long, isn't it? Have you got some scissors? - Yes. Where did you get these things from? - They're my mother's dresses. Do you wear them sometimes? - I've kept them since my mother died. Where do you buy your dresses? - I make them myself. Stand up straight. Turn round. One day we'll go and buy you some things together. You've got nice legs. You should always wear such short skirts. Keep still. From now on I'll call you Oo. Oo? Do you know the story of Oo? Oo is a story about a very poor girl. She sold flowers. No one knew anything about her and she didn't know anything about the world. She didn't even know the name of the flowers she sold. One day, a man bought flowers from her. He was a rich man. His name was Higgins. He was a very cultured man. Mr Higgins couldn't believe his eyes. Before him was a very beautiful girl but no one paid any attention to her. Everyone thought she was ugly because she spoke badly and knew nothing. He took her home with him and taught her lots of things. He showed her everything he knew. Oo became very beautiful and cultured. People admired her. Many men fell in love with her. Is that a true story? It's just a story. Here's the bubble bath. Shall I put it next to the bed? No, come in. Don't be shy. Sit down. Sit down. Pour some in. Bathrooms are the ideal place for confidential conversations. We haven't spoken to each other very much. Tell me, do you like your work? Yes, sir, very much. You're a strange girl. Call me Michel. In fact, I don't know anything about you. Who are you? Where are you from? Where did you live before you came here? - Zepperen. What a hole! Why did you look for work here? It wasrt me, it was my aunt. She didn't want me to live with her anymore. She found a job where I could live in in a newspaper. Havert you got any parents? No. I lived with my mother until last year. Then my aunt took me in. Didrt it work out? - It did to start with. But then she became very strict and unpleasant. Maybe she became jealous. Jealous? Of my uncle. He was very nice to me. He always told me about his journeys as a sailor. My aunt said he exaggerated, to make it sound interesting. One day she said I was big enough to support myself and I should leave. Before things went wrong. She looked for work for me. You're so shy. Look at me. Will you cut my nails for me? I'm no good at it using my left hand. Why are you shaking? Have you never been friends with a boy? Yes, I have. We wrote to each other for a long time. He lived in Australia. We wrote to each other frequently. One day he got married. I didn't receive any more letters. What was his name? - Michel. Damn. I'll do it myself. Go to bed. Give here. Undo your hair. Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't be scared. No, don't do that. No! No! You hurt me. I've brought some breakfast. You aren't angry? Did I hurt you? - Loving someone can mean hurting them. I'll see to your back. Act like a dog. Lick. Was that your first time? - Yes. Where are are you going? - Downstairs. Let me get dressed. What are you planning to do? - Make love. No, Michel. Not here. It's too cold. You'll enjoy it. - No, I don't want to. Don't do that, Michel. - You've got to learn everything. To surrender, to love, to enjoy. To lose yourself. Do you want to? Do you love me? Yes. - Then be my Oo. Do you want me to love you? Yes. Tell me that you're enjoying it. - I'm enjoying it. Tell me you'll do everything I ask. I'll do everything. - I love you, Oo. Stop. Stop, Michel. No more. Stretch your legs. Spread your arms. Stretch out. Are you still cold? - No. Turn over. You're great. I want to make love to you. Open your mouth. Stretch your arms. Lick. Lick the marble. Lick the ground. More. Turn over. Cover yourself. Kiss me. Stay like that. Stretch out. There. Put your hands on your head. Keep your eyes open. I want to hurt you. Look at me. Look at me or I'll hit you! Michel! Why did you do that? You hurt me! Let me go. - Just a bit longer. Leave me alone. Oo, listen to me. You don't get it. Are you leaving? I've left you a note. Michel, I'm very sorry, but I can't stay here. I'm going back to my aunt or I'll look for work elsewhere. We're not meant for each other. I don't regret having met you. I forgive you. Goodbye. It's full of mistakes. Arert you taking anything I bought you? No, Michel. Pack that. - Let's just forget everything. Kiss me. - No, Michel, no! I'm leaving! Is it because I hit you? Do you want me to apologise? Wasrt I good to you? I asked you something. Answer me. Am I bad? Then stay a bit longer. No, there's no point. Let me out, Michel. You scared me. - You're staying here. Give me the key. Let me leave. You have no right. I care for you. - You're lying. Be nice and come here. Let me explain first, then you can go. You're beautiful. Kiss me. Leave me alone. You're drunk. I want you. I'd give you anything to stay. Don't be scared. We won't go too far. I'll turn you into a fantastic girl, a girl I love. Let me get undressed. I love you. Wait a minute. Don't look. You're a bitch. I like that. No! Give me the key. Give me the key. - No. Give me the key. You'll stay here for as long as I want you to. You can go. I'm staying. Get lost. Come here. Do you want to stay? - Yes. Are you sure? - Yes. Will you obey me? - I love you. About everything? You want a master, eh? You'll be my little girl? - Yes. You won't be angry if I have other girls? No. Will you be my little slave? Yes. Can I do anything I want to you? Yes. Even hit you? - No. Say you want it. If you don't hit me too hard. Tell me you want it. Yes. You've got beautiful eyes, a beautiful nose, a beautiful mouth. A beautiful stomach. Beautiful legs. You're mine. Hello? - Hello, Oo. I'll be late home. I've got things to sort out. Can you check my suits? I'll probably have to go away for a few weeks. Where are you going? - To Hong Kong, for gadgets. What are you doing? Nothing. I'm bored. I've had a letter from my uncle. He's coming to fetch me. Have you got the letter there? - Yes. Read it to me. Gis?le, your aunt has told me about the scandalous situation you are in. We can't let it go on any longer. I don't understand how you can do it. We gave you a good upbringing. I've already called round, but no one was home. I'll call back again. I'll take you with me and we'll look for other work for you. I want to have a serious talk with you. Best wishes from your Uncle Oscar. What do you think? I don't know. - Do you want to leave? No. Don't worry. We'll sort it out. See you later. Give me a kiss. Put this on. Is he usually on time? - Yes, he is usually. I'll be in my room with Leni. When he comes, don't tell him we're here. Michel. - See you later. Are you ready? - Come in. Where are your things? - In my room. Go on. Let's go and get them. Are you alone? - Yes. Where's your room? - Upstairs. Show me the way. But you're not ready. You knew I was coming to get you, didn't you? I'm not leaving. - Pack your bags. Shall I pack them for you? And that outfit? Do you think that is suitable? Are you taking those dresses? Who is it? - Her uncle. Listen, Gis?le, I've never been cross with you before, but if you don't help me pack your bags, you'll be in trouble! What's the matter? Come here. I love him. - You can't live with a man like that. You are being kept. Where is this young man? Do you really love him that much? He's fantastic. But does he love you? Or is he just keeping you? I don't know. Gis?le, you've changed. It's for your own good. You know I like you. Leave me here. Tell Aunt that you spoke to Michel. And that we're getting married. - What's going on? Take me. You've always wanted me. No. We mustrt, darling. We can't do that. They're in bed. You're a monster. People are weak, hypocritical and stupid. I hate them. That was wrong. It was stupid of us. What's the time? - I don't know. Hurry up. Michel will be home soon. We're mad. How on earth did it happen? Leave it. I'll make the bed later. Next week I'm going to Hong Kong for two weeks. You can come and stay here if you want. You can keep Oo company. It's an exciting experience. You go too far. - She's happy. I'll take care of things with your aunt. Promise me you'll never say anything. Swear. - OK. Never mention it again. Promise me. If only you knew how much I regret it. Goodbye. You were great. Hello. Let me see. You haven't got a temperature. Tell me, is it Michel? Are you suffering from the pangs of love? Tell me, Gis?le. Silly girl. You can't mean it! He doesn't love you. I'll do the cooking today. You stay in bed. Do you need anything? Shall I buy you some magazines? You really don't want anything? You're very kind. I've got an idea. I'm going shopping. I'll bring you a surprise. That's all. I'll give you something to read. MICHEL, I HOPE YOU ENJOY READING THIS BOOK. LENI. For the first time, she'd reached the limit of her body. Her life only had a point if she could push the experience to its extreme. The more she became this mars prisoner, the closer she felt to freedom. What's that? It's a story. You should know it. It's the story of Oo. I gave it to him last year for his birthday. Read it. You'll understand. Michel isn't really a bad man, but he's got everything that he wants. He looks for sensations and you're that sensation. I'm going shopping. I'll bring you a surprise. Order me around, tell me what to do. My will, my wishes, my mind are all there to serve you. I pledge myself. Without restriction. Without restriction. Gis?le. It's a nightmare. Oo becomes totally unresisting. All she keeps is her body. I've got your surprise. Come here. Oh, a puppy! He's for you. - He's so cute! That's very sweet of you. Thank you. - It's a boxer. He's fantastic. Thank you. What shall we call him? Samba. Yes. Samba, little Samba. Just a minute. I'll take his collar off. Arert you going to try on your dress? - We'll try on everything. Look. Give here. It's beautiful. Take it. No, it's yours. - Take it, I'm giving it to you. Wait a minute, I'll help you. You're so beautiful. We've spent a lot. - That doesn't matter. Let me do it. You've got lovely skin. Where's Samba? Samba! Poor little Samba, we'd forgotten all about you. He was on the stairs. - The poor thing. Do you want you play? Go on. I like you. I feel happy when I'm with you. And Michel? I don't know. I think I love him. You should put it round your neck. Everything OK? Fine. Has Leni gone? Yes, she left today. She left a note. D'you want me to get it? - No, I'll read it later. Put some coffee on. I've been drinking rubbish for a month. I've got a surprise. Me too. Later. It's beautiful. It's real. Michel, it's fantastic. Put it on and we'll have some coffee. FOR MICHEL Michel, I had a lovely time here. I hope your trip went well. Gis?le and I have become good friends. You mustrt abuse such a sensitive girl. She loves you. Respect her, or you will be none the better for it. I look forward to hearing from you. See you later. Leni. This is Samba. Leni gave him to me. You know I don't like dogs. But he's so sweet. Look at him. Hold him for a while. I get the impression Leni and you got on well together. Keep that dog in your room. - But Michel... Didrt you hear? If you don't want him to have to go. Good morning. Since when do you lock the door? - You werert very nice. Have you got a new dress too? Arert you wearing anything underneath it? Oo never wore underwear. I read the book. Did Leni give it to you? - Yes. Wait. You drive me crazy. - Keep going, Michel. You've changed a lot. D'you hear? You've a lot to say for yourself. - Keep going. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Oo, listen to me. - My name is Gis?le. Make some more coffee. It's cold. I don't love you when you're like this. When did you stop wearing your chain? I'm still wearing it. I didn't give it to you to wear it there. I want you to wear my dresses again. You've got poor taste. You've put too much salt in it. I've already told you, I don't want to see that dog. Get it out of here. Dear Leni, I haven't heard from you. Come and see me. I need you. A lot has changed between Michel and me. Sometimes he calls me Oo, sometimes Gis?le. He makes comments about everything. We no longer sleep together. He hasn't said anything to me for days now. Sometimes he glares at me. Then I'm scared. I don't know if I still love him. I don't think so. I'm thinking of leaving here soon. Samba is fine but Michel wants me to keep him in my room. When he's not there, I let him run around in the house. Forgive my spelling mistakes. I hope to hear from you soon. With love. Samba. Samba. The bastard! Samba? It's me. Where's Samba? - Just look how worried you are! I killed him. You're lying. You're going to obey me. You're going to do exactly what I say. Never, you bastard! I hate you! I'm sorry, Michel. Let me see. I'll see to it. Open the door, please. Open the door. D'you hear me? Open this door. Open the door! Whore! Whore! I'm crazy, eh Samba? Completely crazy. We'll tell her. I love her. And you tell her I'm nice to you. We'll tell her together that we love her. That we're nice. We'll be happy. I'll stop. We'll start again. I'll stop playing, drinking and acting crazy. She'll be our woman. Come on. We'll tell her. We'll grow up.
