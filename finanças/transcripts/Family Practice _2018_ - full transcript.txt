A FILM BY JESHUA DREYFUS This is what my life looks like without my parents. I haven’t seen them in 6 months. And now ... my father is turning 60. Fabienne is curious. I can’t avoid them forever. So now’s the time. FAMILY PRACTICE You’re finally here. You’re Fabienne? Welcome! Shabbat is the celebration of Shechina, the bride and the divine mother. She is the source of life ... Hello! And that’s why we thank the housewife on the day of Shabbat for her work during the week. So much for our distribution of roles in this household. It’s also tradition that on Shabbat the husband and wife nurture their relationship and focus on their love ... You of all people. Be kind to one another. Well that’s how it’s written! I don’t do this just like that! - No, it’s okay. - Yes? - What? No, he studied art. - Freddy, I draw. - Why? - I draw, I’m an illustrator. - And what do you draw? - Comics. So you didn’t study medicine? - One semester, 5 years ago. - Nothing’s getting any cheaper. That’s true! Don’t you want to go back to studying medicine? Karl you also combine your practice and your writing work. True. But he doesn’t want a safety net. I think it’s great, it’s brave! And it’s another generation, you know. - Thank God! - Don’t give up hope just yet. Simon’s one of the finalists in a well-known comics festival. No, really? Is that true? Yeah, but I’m just one of 40. Do the math. Hey, so what? You can win. You’re going to win. You’ll do it! He’ll be more famous than his dad. I've always said it! - Doesn’t anyone smoke here? - I gave it up 3 years ago. - Oh great! - They’re real artists! There’s always something going on! The images that were created there! For me as a hypochondriac ... Wait! Wait a sec! It runs in the family! Would it bother Fabienne if you came home once in a while? - Are you earning any money? - No, not really. But are you managing with what we give you? Yeah. - But it can’t be enough. - It is. I have an idea. You could ... Thank you, thanks. You could transcribe Karl’s book. Aren’t you doing that? We have to go to Cielle, the book has to be done in 2 months, the lectures ... No, I really can’t! Fabienne is waiting for my drawings! - What do you think of her? - It’s too early to say. - A first impression? - Yeah, she’s nice. - Is she a little nervous? - What? Why? Ah, this fish! She likes a drink. - It’s a party! - If she doesn’t make a habit of it! Shall I bring this out? Yeah. Wait. Those are the other plates. Who's the woman in the white blouse? Around 40. - Sonja, our new secretary? - What? At the practice? Yeah. You haven’t met her? No. Life begins at 60! You said it! Do you want to go home? Mom? What happened? What’s wrong, Mommy?! - Mommy? - Water on her forehead! - What happened? Simon ... - Is it happening again? Please, let me. What is it? Okay. Lie down! Please lie down. - Can I help? - Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Stay calm. Lie down. Everything’s okay. It’s her circulation. It’ll be fine. What happened? What are you doing? You silly head! Has this happened before? It’s been a while. - Shall I still come to yours? - Why not? Is that the essence of tonight? - What do you mean? - Your family has so much to offer! - Do you think you can ignore them? - Shall I draw Mom in a puddle of blood? Sorry. Hands off! Hey! You know exactly. You’re bringing them today! Okay? - More of the animal series? - No, it’s a new one. We agreed on something totally different. - I don’t really like the other idea. - And you’re telling me this now? - Yes? - The infrastructure in no way meets today’s standards. - Why not? - What’s wrong? - It all has to be replaced. - What? - The switchboard panel is asbestos. - It’ll have to go! - Did you bring the old sketches? It all has to go. And the wires running into the other room ... it’s all ... falling apart. The cables are broken. This one’s powerful. Don’t you think? Because there are people in it and it seems more relevant? It’d be something new for you, and would fit perfectly into the exhibition. So this is where you’re hiding! Wow, this is impressive! - Hello. Oh God! - Not worth mentioning! Was there a furniture restorer in here before? Can you smell that? Amyl acetate. The smell doesn’t fade. Do you have a second? What for? I talked to your Dad. We’ll pay you 50 francs an hour for the transcription. So in a week ... - Mom I don’t have time! - Don’t let yourself be exploited! - I’m not! Doesn't she have a family? She'll understand! Do you have to go on holiday right now? Listen, Karl and I, we ... need some time for each other. Can’t someone else do it? No, no one else can do it. If you don’t do it, I’ll have to. And he’ll go on holiday with Sonja. Yeah, so now you know. But if you need the money, he’ll let you do it and I can go away with him. I'm not getting involved. This is your business. - Don’t you be exploited. Set boundaries. - That’s why I want to go away with him. - So we can sort things out there. - Why can’t you sort things here? - Forget it! - No! No! Forget it! I won’t go anywhere, and I’ll do it myself. Yes! She’s the only thing on his mind. He’s under her spell. If they go to Cielle together ... I don’t know what else will happen. So? What should I do? Oh, Mom! We’re opening in three weeks! - I’ll manage! - Never! - Dad is screwing his secretary. - What’s new about that? He brings her into the house and to Shabbat ... - Is that sacrilegious or what? - He never dared to before! - The one in the black skirt? - Yes. - Are you responsible for your mother? - She’s going crazy. Don’t you get it? Well, maybe she will finally get it. - Should I find a replacement for you? - No, I’ll manage. It’s just a week. Just follow the numbers, it’s really simple. Sometimes I added one, like here, 2B, but other than that they’re in order. - And if they’re not in order, you’ll notice. - Why are the cassettes numbered? These numbers match those numbers, that’s the book. - Everything you babble on there I have to ... - Exactly. Those are my lectures, Q&As, interviews ... - You don’t have a manuscript? Simon, it’s not a problem! Don’t worry. It’s all in High German. And I already wrote down the time codes, all here. Just follow them. Watch out, the VHS have two sets of time codes: one at the top and one at the bottom. Follow the top one. That's at least a month’s work. That’s two weeks if you focus. Three weeks tops. Yes? Doctor? About the prescription ... Oh, yes. Oh God, no! Of course. Right, sorry. - '53. - 1953, right. What did we say? 200 mg, yes? That’s it. - All the best. - Thank you. Goodbye! See you. Sonja comes in three times a week. You know that, right? I can’t let Fabienne wait that long. What’s this with Fabienne? We have a project. - An art project? - Yeah, an art project. Cool. Did you see your cow by the way? If you don’t want to, then say so. I’ll talk to Mom and ... No, it’s fine. I’ll do it. Here's a suggestion: you do the VHS cassettes and then Sonja can carry on. Don’t tell Mom you’re not doing it all. What do you think of her by the way? She’s been in a bad mood recently, she stopped smoking. You know, me and her ... I know. I’ve never met such a great woman. I feel like I'm 30. - So the text files ... - And you and Fabienne? Is it serious? Yeah, I think so. I think it’s really great you’re transcribing these texts now. - You’ll do a great job. - Thank you. - So, should I e-mail you the chapters ... - No, give them to Sonja. - She’ll give them to me. - Why? Why? Because I think it’s good if someone rereads them. Here's the flash drive. I don’t know how I'll manage, a whole month without her. - Mom didn't want her in Cielle. - Mom’s so cruel, huh? If the organizer or the publisher call, give them my mobile number. And if you have any questions about the text call me, not your Dad. - And be careful ... - Yes? I don’t want her in our apartment. Make sure you always lock up. Take care. Enjoy! And have a good time! It’s hard to make a living drawing comics. A scholarship makes it possible to focus on a book project. They would’ve let me know. - If I’d won, they would’ve let me know. - They said you should come. Let's hear who the winners are. They said everyone should come who entered the competition. And for the first prize, please put your hands together for Maximilian Locher. They’ve got no idea. - Is this your first time at Fumetto? - Yes. I was here as a visitor once, but I guess that doesn't count. - No ... Our own exhibition is coming up. Bring me your sketches tomorrow? This book is about the number 1 human topic: love and relationships. Love that isn’t restrictive, but liberating and meaningful. Becoming deeper and stronger over time because it’s lived in honesty. I hope the money’s for something essential. What money? The money you’re making and so desperately need. How do you mean? Because of your money problems I couldn’t go away on holiday. I wouldn’t have expected too much from that holiday. Sorry? Do you know what Cielle is? Who’s there? - You know Karl’s history, don’t you? - What history? His relationship history. You think you know anything about my relationship with Karl? What we tell each other? - Not so tight. Couldn't open it last time. - Stupid crappy tap! - 7 litres a day, he said. - What? If it drips every 3 seconds. Now he’s starting to drool. Come on! Just think about it. Do you think I’ll be woman number 15 waiting in a hotel room for you to come by once a day for an hour? I’m sick of wasting my time. Exactly. Well, my dear, you have a house, a career, a family. I do? It’s always the same! Yes? Hi! Everything okay? - Normal. - And at the practice? Did you talk to Sonja? Yeah, she hinted that you talked about my past. - Briefly, yeah. Yeah? About what? Your exes. Simon I’d rather you didn’t talk about stuff like that. I do talk to her about that kind of stuff of course but ... she’s a lot more fragile than you’d think ... at first. I’ll do it at my pace, okay? - Just leave her in peace. - Hmm. Okay? I’d say relationships nowadays call for a radical approach. Radical honesty, radical trust, radical compromise. Romantic relationships and honesty can coexist ... must coexist. You can’t have one without the other. And how far does this radical honesty go? I listen to my gut. I don’t know how you can spend all day staring at that screen! And you, what are you doing? Patient reports. - For every session? - After 40. For you, or what? Aha, health insurance companies, so they keep paying? Right. That’s why I have to embellish things a bit. "The patient is very ill, needs a lot more therapy." The insurance companies are getting worse, with all the things they want to know! Kathrin calls me a pen-pusher sometimes. How is she doing actually? Why didn’t she come to Dad’s party? Ever since the thing with Sonja, she’s kept her distance from your father. Why? Well, you know ... an ex-patient as an employee ... But she’s doing a good job, so... Excuse me, you work here, don’t you? - Yeah, sort of, yeah. - I’m in group therapy with Dr Graf. and I’d like to try a private session with Dr Kaufmann. Well, Mrs Brunner is responsible for that. Here she is. - I’d like an appointment with Dr Kaufmann. - He’s fully booked. He told me that. But at his lecture last week he said I should make an appointment. Do you want to see his schedule? He’s really booked solid. I’m leaving now. I need the flash drive. Never mind, I’ll e-mail it to you. Maybe I have another one somewhere. - Why do I have to correct these texts? - I don’t get it either. Does he think I don’t have anything better to do than to read his book? I know exactly what you mean. Just because Karl lost his texts I have to transcribe the videos! I mean ... For God’s sake where are they?! I’m sure it’ll be fine. Don’t worry. 9 percent. - What a rip-off! - Too late. - You signed already? - Yes. - Do you have 15 grand lying around? - Can’t you talk to the electrician? I have to start tomorrow, or we won't make it by the 26th. What are you doing now? Well, I'm going home to draw. Can I come to yours? - Coffee? - No thanks. Here you go. - Here, I found another flash drive. - Oh, thanks. About yesterday ... I mean, if for you it's not ... right? Okay. And about Karl ... We won’t tell him, okay? I told him already. Well, of course not that it was with you. I do not believe it is a coincidence. Are you coming? We're going to Hirschen for lunch. Young couples often won't even look into each other's eyes during lovemaking. Don’t forget to take a break! See you later. Sometimes more than appropriate. Manipulative ... Pathological lying, as exemplified by Thomas Mann’s character ... - Is Sonja Brunner here? - No, she’s not here. Can I leave this here? Or I also have another address. Plattenstrasse 6. - Mr Kaufmann said ... - It’s okay. I’ll take it. Have a good one. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE, FOR YOUR LOVE, FOR STANDING BY ME. WITH ALL MY LOVE, KARL Fabienne Schmid, please leave a message. Hey, it’s me. Do you want to have lunch? I’ve decided to knock off early. Bye. Hey! What are you doing here? - Taking some time off. - Really? - And what are you guys doing? - Do you remember Max? Of course! Hi! - Hi, how are you? - We’re just talking. - He might do something for the exhibition. - Cool. We’re going over later. You coming? - I’ve got stuff to do. - Okay. - Okay ... - Okay. Hey ... - Bye. - Bye. Do you know how he’s doing? You let him live off you! At that age? Where are they? - The roses? - Roses? ...that in Hebrew the word for 'making love' is also the word for 'knowing each other'. Why did you give him that job even though I’m here? Do I just have to accept it? No, but maybe ... just look at his drawings. - They show his mental state... - How do you mean? Emotionally, Simon is a child. He draws animals like a 5-year-old, working through his traumas. So what? Considering how damaged he is, he’s coping well with life. - Are you defending him now? - Agnes used to be even more hysterical. - With a mother like that ... - What’s that got to do with me? Simon’s not like other people. It’s an unconscious thing. Unfortunately, he thinks he’s an artist. Just a sec, I’ll call you back. What do you think you’re doing? You brought it on yourself. - I’m sure he has a great analysis of you. - Yeah, yeah! How do you think he evaluated you as a patient? How great and mentally fit you are? - With those horns. Good idea. - You’re taking it to ... You’re almost done, right? - You’re going to that edge? - I’m just wondering if we could ... carry on with one or both of them over here, so that ... my landscape can continue into here and something from your... Totally! Near the horn or so? - What? - Sonja says you want to quit? Imagine! But why all of a sudden? - Did I miss something? - You have three guesses! Is it because of Fabienne? Just forget it! Okay. Is it about the house? - No, no. - What is it then? - He doesn’t want to work anymore. - What? - Why not? - I don’t know. You talk to him. Listen! Simon, what’s going on? This lying shitty book! I can’t do this another minute! Stop talking like that! Is that clear? Whatever! - I just won’t do it! - For once I ask you for something! - And you let me down! - I just can’t do it anymore. Listen, you promised. It’s got nothing to do with you, Mom. Of course it does! Because we’ll come straight home if you don’t carry on. I’m finally starting to sleep again. I’m at my limit! - Hey, hi! - Hey! Did you hire him? Almost. - That was fast. - What? Replacing me. Now you’re drinking in the daytime? - Don’t you think you ... - Do we have a problem? Crazy how soon you found someone else! We’re opening in 2 weeks ... Maybe it suits you just fine. Simon, you know exactly what I think of your drawings. Yeah. Not really relevant, too many animals. It was just about you drawing something new, and evolving. - I’m not evolving. - And take a stand! I don’t take a stand, either. So! Just tell me! You want me gone so you and that guy can ...? Yes, exactly. Bye. Man! What's the rush? I’ll show you how to transcribe. - Where’s the key? - Which one? I don't know. Can we do this now? I don’t have all day. - I don’t have all day! - Where’s the key? Do you really want to read that now? Okay. But go out for a minute. I want the whole file. Hello? A quick question. Half a pill in the morning makes me feel nauseous. - Can I take a whole one in the evening ...? - If you like! Okay. Good. My husband thinks I'm a lot slower and ... a bit listless now. He’s doesn’t really agree with it. But I am feeling better. - What’s the question? - Should I keep taking it? What does your gut tell you? Yes. Your husband has to compromise. Are you going to be a psychiatrist like your father? Of course! Like so many of your tribe, right? Interesting, huh? - I could sue you for this. - For what? - For reading it. - I didn’t. I’ll put it back. Let's go downstairs. - Did you reach Signer? - Ah, no! I need the list of participants for the weekend. You know the one I mean. - Okay. - Is everything else okay? Yeah yeah. - Dr Graf? - Mrs Jankovich, yes exactly, 10 minutes! No, no! Come to me! Come here! I’m going home. Will you come and visit me sometime? Sure. Are you coming tonight? - Where? - The Thai bar. Is it Friday already? How are things at the gallery? Good. We’re hanging the pictures, trying things out. It’s good. And this guy Max? What’s he like? He’s cool. Good. And ... Fabienne is really working with him now? Yeah, totally. Completely. Cool. Why aren’t you doing anything? Don’t know. Don’t feel like it. What do you mean? No idea. It’s just ... such a grind, you know what I mean. Drawing ... New stuff all the time. I don't know. Maybe I’ll stop altogether. Really? And at home? Your family? - What about it? - Everything okay? Same madhouse as always. The usual. Nothing worth talking about. Always you! The dreamy sound of your voice! In the middle of a July night, this is serious, I’m delirious. Nothing’s the same anymore. Thursday, the day to say "I love you" and be true. My eighth and ninth love that's you! When you gently take me in your arms. One day without you leaves me lost for what to do! My tenth love that’s you! Only ever you! Nothing’s the same anymore. Neither places nor thoughts, neither things nor people. Neither places nor thoughts or words nothing’s the same anymore. In the middle of a July night, this is serious, I am delirious. Hi. Hey. Thursday, the day to say "I love you" and be true. I slept with Sonja. Where are you going? What do you want? Can’t we talk about it? Okay. Do you have anything to tell me? I ... can't think ... of anything. So where do we go from here? Sonja Brunner: Is that you? - This thing really works. - What does? This chat thing. It's Friday night. You’re not out with friends at your age? You don't go out on Shabbat. You can celebrate Shabbat at my place, too. Come in. I want you inside me. I don’t have a goblet, and only regular bread. Is that a problem? Does it even have to be challah? No, it’s not a problem. Sorry, I only have his. There’s no breakfast in the house. Gone shopping, back soon. S. Hi. Is Sonja around as well? I ... wanted to pick up something. Uh, I ... Why are you here? It’s actually my apartment. Sonja wants a baby. You know that, right? It was one of the reasons why we were having problems. Nice. We’re back. I just wanted to come by quickly to talk about how we should ... Did you sleep well? Simon. Please talk to your mother. For her this whole thing is ... not so easy. - Stop talking such bullshit. Okay, I’ll leave you to it. Was he here for long? - What did you tell him? - Looks like you told him already. Yeah, but he was so weird. - Should we talk to him? - For you it's all about him. What? And for you? Shut up! - Yes? - What are you doing? - Does she really want to kill herself? - Simon wouldn't know that! - Sorry. Sonja is ... - Can you just be quiet please? - She’s threatening your father. - Agnes! Sonja’s been suicidal before. This is a serious threat. Simon doesn’t know that. - But you know it, right? - Yes, of course. Listen, Simon, is she playing one of her games? - I don’t know what you’re ... - I'm going to her. - If you leave now I'm gone for good. - Agnes, please! No drama. I’ll be held responsible if she goes through with it. Okay? - Mommy? - Simon? What did you do!? Somehow it’s all falling apart. Listen ... Mom? You have reached ... You can leave again right now. No, don't touch me! I'm sorry. We need some distance from each other. This isn’t healthy any more. I left home when I was 17. And you’re still here. - You always want me to come! - No. We just worry about you sometimes. But you’re an adult now. So you don’t actually want me to come? Do you even know how I’m doing? Come to me! Come here. Yes, come here! You know what? I give him so much freedom but he still lies to me. Do you even love me? - But these are better anyway. - I need another 6. Perfect. I’ll hang them the way I was thinking. Then you can tell me if I should change anything. I’m so sorry. You were right. Get out! - Please Fa, can we talk? - No. Please! I’ll be outside. It was damn mistake, okay? - It didn’t mean anything. I only want you. - ‘Didn't mean anything’? With your Dad’s lover? I know. - You don’t know shit. - Yes, I do now! - You’ve got no clue what's up with you. - You did it with Max, too! What did I do? Is that what you think? Huh? - Are you serious? - You didn’t? You’re such a baby! Fabienne, please! - Get away from me! Leave me alone! - Please! I don’t want anything to do with you anymore! Leave me alone! Go! The question is, what does it mean? He just woke up. Okay. See you later! Good morning! How are you? Are your ears better? So the Seroquel is working, then? Last year I was lying up there when I had the infection after the surgery. When I had my vasectomy. I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner. My life is in total chaos. But you had visitors, the nurse said. Who came? Mom? How is she? Where did she spend the night? Did she say anything about me? I can't just be with her. Sonja needs me, too. Maybe you can tell her that. She listens to you. She has only suffered. - How do you mean? - Because of you! No way! Do you really think so? She ... wants so little closeness. And I'm not a monk. But she’ll always be my number 1! Always! She’s the mother of my son! LOVE – a real UTOPIA "Just because man has never been able to cultivate this incomprehensible thing called love for any length of time. Too much fear and too little courage inhibit them. If they could cultivate love, laws and patterns would become superfluous. Unconditional trust, affectionate sharing and togetherness, these would be the dominant traits of coexistence. Relationships would also no longer need a form. But what does a relationship without form look like?” This you’ll find out in chapter 4. That was a first impression. Thank you all very much. You came after all. Do you think it’ll do you good? How’s university? Are you dissecting frogs? A different crowd than human medicine, right? Simon, what's up? I would like to thank two people. For one, Agnes Kaufmann. Agnes, come up here. No, no. As always a great help. Thank you. And ... Sonja Brunner! Sonja, with her tough, skeptical questions, always ... - Do you think it's easy for me to watch? You don't have to. Will you make sure that kid grows up properly? And the lecture series starts next month in Altenburg. - Is that right, Agnes? Altenburg? - Yes! In Altenburg, yes. Well, then let me just say, let’s start living this real utopia. Your Mom said you weren’t sure about your studies. If you ever have one of those little guys, you’ll see it was the right decision. - Simon, come on! - Yes, come on! And cheese! To Karl!
