George. An officier at your station is time and again being overlooked. - Are you referring to WPC Parman? - Yes. She came through CID training with exceptional reports, so why has she been in uniform for the past 14 months? - She can´t work in a team. - Who says? A consensus of opinion. Sorry, if you´re trying to find a sexual bias, you´ll have to do better. I have several reports of incidents in wich Sally Parnam... - She can´t take a joke. - She won´t put up with bad attitudes. And if you can´t take a joke, you shouldn´t work in teams. - Could you stick this in a box for me? - Sure. - See you tomorrow. - Bye, George. Gemma? Hello. It´s Christine´s mum. Is Christine there? Oh. When did she leave? Er... did she say she was coming straight home? Is there anywhere else she might have gone to? Oh, yes, yes. I´ll try Rosie. If she does come back to you, could you telephone me as soon as possible? All right. Thank you. Bye. Well, she left two hours ago. - He´s late. - He´s not coming. - He´d better. - He´s got to come, ain´t he? He won´t come. He´s scared. He´ll turn up. He knows what´ll happen if he don´t, don´t he? Yeah, and he knows what´ll happen if he does. She was supposed to come home three hours ago, from Gemma´s. She didn´t mention anything? Yes, I´ve tried Chloe. No, she´s not at the school. I´ll try someone else. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. That´s everyone. Oh, I´m sorry. I´m sorry. I´m sorry. So, how was it? Was it good? Ah, yeah, yeah, it was... Oh, it was great. It was the best show you´ll ever miss in your life. Right. Well, don´t worry, I´ll pay for the tickets. No, that´s OK. No, I insist. Really. No. I just got here myself actually. I missed it. You´re joking. What, did you get held up at work? Yeah, meeting. - 34 quid? - Honest, that´s all I could get. - 60 quid, Webster. - I know. I´ll get the rest later. Honest. - Shopping? Cinema? - No. There´s no question of that. There´s no problem with her being allowed to do things. Could she have forgotten to tell you she was going somewhere? No, not on a school night. Homework to do. Right. Yeah, justice. Of course I believe in justice, but retribution as well. It´s very important. I had this case a couple of years ago. There was this killer walked free, suspended sentence. I mean, the guy definitely did it. Jesus, I get angry about it still. How do you think the families of the victim feel? They need retribution. It helps them sleep at night. After all, you´ve got to be able to believe in the system. Yeah, Jane Tennison. Where? - Look at this, sarge. - Bill. - She´s down here. - Are you AMIP? No, and I do have a name. - Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison. - DCI Tom Mitchell. All right, what have we got here, then, Tom? Well, she´s been dead no more than a few hours. Violently assaulted, hands bound, brought to the site in a Camden Borough refuse sack. - Probably tossed from the embankment here. - What, not thrown from a train? No. I´d say that was impossible, the way the bag landed. - Do you think the kids moved her? - Not that we´re aware of. - Any idea who she is? - Not yet. There are a few boot and shoe prints, so we should be able to lift something. OK. - Well, when are we going to see the body? - Any time after nine. - Bill... - What is it? The scent of perfume in her hair. Patrick. Oh, shit. - Hello? - Richard? Richard, can you meet me at Dartmouth Park Morgue at nine o´clock this morning? Yeah. Yeah. I reckon she was dumped on the embankment around three o´clock in the morning. - Friday morning? - Friday, yes. She´d been there 18-19 hours. Was she dead before she was put in the bag? Probably died around midnight. One can´t be sure. - How old do you think she is? - 50. 55. These wounds to the torso were caused by a long, thin-bladed instrument, the order of an eighth of an inch wide, six inches long. Clean entry wounds. These marks here to both wrists... ...would indicate she´d been tied up for some period of time. Now, these weals to the upper arms... Arm clamps. Well, yes, that´s possible. - Very good. - Strung up and clamped? Strung up. I wouldn´t like to say. - Any evidence of her killer? - No semen. No trace of anything that might prove useful. Might be something on the bag. The hands are spotless. Nothing under the fingernails. Have they been scrubbed? Scrubbed is possible. Yes. It´s only the clamping of the arms. Yeah. I want the photos as soon as possible. Don´t tell anyone about this. No. But, I mean, it is only the clamping that makes us think it´s a connection. Maybe a little hobgoblin lets him out at night. You did put away the right man. There´s no question of that. Marlow, Marlow, Marlow... Where is it? Ah-ha. - Mike, I want to stay on this case. - Really? - I thought you liked doing budgets. - Oh, very funny. Look, I want Haskons on it with me. - OK. You´ll have Mitchell shadowing you. - Why? We´ve got him in mind to join AMIP as a DCI. You´re all right, he´s a nice lad. - Fancy him, do you? - Get out. I´ll see if I can arrange a date. Good morning. Detective Superintendent Tennison. I´m sure you all know that I´ll be working with you from now on. - Tom, have we got an identification yet? - Marjorie Miller. - Is she local? - Yeah. Kentish Town. Osborne Road. - Well, what do we know about her? - Excuse me. She was a widow, lived on her own, worked for Scott´s Mill Clothing Company, assistant managing a shop in the West End, she used to go out to the club on Tuesday evenings. Club? What club? - Our club. Our area social. - Why? Her husband was duty officer here until he died six years ago. - What, at this station? - Yeah. She left the club about 10:30pm, went outside to catch a bus home... Colin, take that for us, will you? Cheers. Same routine every week. We know she didn´t make it that night. And she left the club on her own? Yeah. We´re trying to find out if anyone saw her after she left. Any relationships? Any lovers? No. Definitely not the type. She was very devoted to her husband. Some of the older guys here knew her. She never looked at another man. Anything else you want to know? No, thank you, but I want everyone in that club questioned. - It doesn´t matter who they are. - It´s being done. She´s here at Marjorie Miller´s house. The photos arrived. Yeah, looking at them now. Oh, shit! It´s got to be a copycat killing. Someone wrote a book claiming Marlow was innocent. I´m sure photos of his victims were in it. What was it called? Yeah, I know the one you mean. - Why? Have you got it? - Yeah. It´s complete rubbish. I worked on the case, so I... Can you let me have it? Sure. This is the same knot that Marlow used to tie up Karen Howard and Della Mornay. If anybody has... any idea where Christine might be, please... please contact the police. Any information at all, however insignificant you might think it is, please call. It´s OK, she´s here. - Anyone holding our daughter... - She´ll be all right with George. - Hey, leave off. He´s an innocent man. - He´s still a nonce. The governor will tell you. Hey. Come on, George. Why ask the governor? You had your hand down his trousers? Come on, now, lads, lay off him. Where´s my trainers? Where´s my bloody trainers? You know, everything I saw in the mortuary this morning is detailed in this bloody book. Everything. What do you make of that? Well, it´s interesting. I mean, what kind of a person would be doing that? What, you mean copy a killing in every detail? - Yeah. - And out of a book? Yes. No-one. I mean, you might be influenced by what you read in a book, or you might get some ideas for what to do with your victim from a book, but you wouldn´t follow it line by line like you were using a recipe. What do you think´s going on, then? - I don´t know. I´ve no idea. - Oh, come on, give me a theory. - Patrick! - What?! I thought you were supposed to know about all this. I need more information than you´re giving me. All right, all right, look... Excuse me. I was watching that. - Well, can´t we talk about this? - No, we can´t talk about it. I just want to sit here and relax. I don´t want to talk about work. You should try listening to what I have to listen to all day. Seriously. All right. Sorry. They don´t use guns. They insert bullets manually. Oi! Boom! I mean, it can´t just be a coincidence. Please, let me just get this thought out, all right? Supposing that whoever´s doing this wants to prove this guy, Whitehouse´s, case. He wants us to believe that Marlow is innocent. Isn´t that more likely than just a coincidence? - It´s possible. - Well, how possible? Personally, I wouldn´t spend a lot of time on it. - What am I left with, then? - A problem. - Which photo? - Della Mornay, hands tied behind her back. - She looks a bit rough. - What do you mean, she looks rough? - She´s dead. - Right. - What have we got? - The pathologist´s report. Good. Anything on the footprints? They´ve lifted 11 separate shoe and boot prints. So far, we´ve eliminated five. The place is mostly used by kids drinking and doing drugs, so we´re doing all the local schools, youth clubs, community centres and hostels. Incidentally, none of those places have use of an Escort van. - Right. - Escort van? Yeah, a man was seen getting into an Escort van at 2:00am on Friday and then driving off. It was parked at the dead-end road leading to the embankment. - And when did this come in? - Yesterday. Why wasn´t I informed? Must have been an oversight. So, who´s the witness? 20-year-old male. Spent the evening drinking with his friends. Says he wasn´t drunk, and there´s no reason to believe he´d be mistaken. - And what´s his description of the man? - Medium height, 5´8"-5´11". Of stocky build and Mediterranean appearance. He was wearing white trainers, dark trousers or jeans and a dark top. Now, one of the footprints on the embankment is a Reebok, Size 8. - Jogging shoe. - He could be Greek. Why do you say that? - Mediterranean, ma´am. - He might have keys to a lockup? Don´t know about that, ma´am. No, like hell you don´t. Don´t call me ma´am. All right, who else has read the book in DC Dyson´s hand? We found it on the table. Ma´am. Yeah, well, all of you who found it on the table... will be struck by the similarity between our murder and the murders committed by George Marlow in a lockup owned by the proprietor of a Greek café. I can´t stop you reading that book, but I will tell you it´s trash. I put Marlow away, so I should know. There is no place on this team for anyone who clouds this investigation by questioning Marlow´s guilt. Is that clear? Oh, and I don´t want any details of this killer´s methods known outside this room. I can assure you... that my officers are a sight more professional... ...than to allow a book to influence them. Hmm. Let´s not go in today. Let´s stay in bed. Let´s go for a walk on Parliament Hill. I wish. No, love. No, I mean it. I mean it. OK. God. You know I can´t. This is the first time in my life I´ve had the feeling that I don´t want to get up and go to work. I don´t want to screw up another relationship. This is the first time in my life I´ve ever felt like this. Tell me it´s not going to happen. It´s not going to happen. Bill. Mutilated, bagged up and dumped. You´ve got another one. - Who found her? - Jogger. Or his dog. How long do you think she´s been here for? - No more than four or five hours. - Bill It´s the same perfume as the other one, only stronger. - What is it? - I´m not surre. It´s quite sweet and heady. It´s definitely in her hair. Christine Bramwell. Age 16. Same mutilation, same marks on the wrists, same weals on the upper arms, same method of disposal. Now, Christine disappeared about 18 hours after Marjorie was found on the embankment. The time of death indicates... that she was held for two days and then killed on the third. That means that we´re looking for a killer... who can keep his victims out of sight and hearing. Unfortunately, there were no footprints found on the site, and we won´t get anything off the body because her hands have been scrubbed. - He´s very thorough. - Or experienced. There was a scent of perfume about Christine and a similar scent was found on Marjorie. No scent of any kind was ever found on Marlow´s victims. Forensic have not yet identified the brand. Now, Christine went missing about five o´clock. How? I mean, she was a bright girl. She knew not to get into a stranger´s car. We know the route she took home, so I want everyone on it questioned, and that means everyone, incluiding the neighbour´s cat. Someone must have seen something. Have we got anything on the van? All hire vehicles and London owners have been checked, and negative. - What about the club? - Every officer and guest was interviewed. - Marjorie definitely left alone. - No-one saw her after she left? - No - What about the Mediterranean connection? Do you have a suggestion? Well, in the book on Marlow... - Oh, I hope this is relevant. - I think so, ma´am. In the book, Whitehouse says that the nephew of the owner of the lockup, a Greek guy, Andreas, had a conviction for an attack on a woman in Manchester in 1988. The first four Marlow murders occurred in the north between ´84 and ´87. We know all this. Andreas was in prison in ´88 when the murders stopped, then moved down to London to work in his uncle´s café in ´89. The fifth and sixth Marlow murders occurred in his uncle´s lockup in 1991. And Andreas left the country a month after Marlow was arrested. He returned here two and a half months ago. - How do you know this? - We´ve checked it out. Do you want me to check out his shoe size? No, I don´t. I want to find out who murdered these two women. Try this. Yeah. Well, it´s something like that. Right... Now try this one. Yeah, that´s it. Yes, definitely. That´s what I smelt too. It´s gardenia. Now, the first one I gave you was a mix, gardenia just being one of its perfumes, but this is a single-note gardenia. And this is what you smelt on Marjorie´s body? Pretty certain. Good. - No. - Are you sure? Yes. Dr Bramwell? She never wore perfume. Can you tell me if you´ve smelt this before? No. - Please, would you just smell it and? - She didn´t wear perfume. - She´s just schoolgirl. - Just tell me if you recognise it. No. Thank you. Marjorie only ever wore one kind of perfume, a Beauty Without Cruelty scent, Aurelia, with no trace of gardenia in it. Good. Well, at least we´ve got something. Can I have a word? I´m not happy with the way this investigation is going. Nor is my team. I hope you´re going to put them straight. When they´re barred from following... an important line of investigation, attitude, teamwork suffer. - All right, what are you trying to say? - Why haven´t we checked Andreas out? - You checked him out already. - We haven´t had him in for questioning. You´ve wasted critical hours on a murder that I´ve already solved. How much more time do you intend to waste? Now, you sort your lads out and get on with the job in hand, which is finding a copycat killer. Don´t say anything. - I was told you wanted me. - Get in the car. Where to? The lockup. The café. Andreas. If it´s going to be checked out, I´m going to do it. Did you take a look at the Whitehouse book? I had to see what everyone´s talking about. Do you want it back? Is there a waiting list? No. I just wondered if you had any idea why Marlow´s girlfriend changed her story. She was dying. Why would that make her say you forced a statement out of her? Look, Marlow´s all she´s got left. She wanted to make things right for him. This is it. Yeah. It was like walking into hell when we first found this place. Let´s go. - Aren´t we going to the café? - No. I thought that´s why we were here. I bollocked Mitchell for wasting his time on this. I´m not going to make the same mistake. Well, I might as well go in and have a cup of coffee. - Do what you like. - As I´m here. Yeah. Yes, sir, how can I help you? I´d like to speak to Mr Andreas Hulenkinis. Oh, for Jesus Christ´s sake! Take him into the back. - What do you want? - Same questions, different face. When were you last questioned? Yesterday! Only yesterday! I have customers here! Don´t you know what your friends are doing? Mr Hulenkinis, I worked on the Marlow case four years ago. Why are you talking to me? It´s my uncle´s lockup. It´s nothing to do with me. You were working here at the time. So? Why did you go back to Cyprus in ´91? Well, it is my home. - Why did you come back here? - For money. - Where are you living? - In my uncle´s house. Can you remember where you were at 2:00am last Friday morning? Well, asleep. Where else? - Where? - In bed. - At home? - No, man, in the garden. And... 2:00am Monday morning? Look, I come here at 6:30 every morning. I leave at 7:30 in the evening. When I go home, I sleep. Of course. I don´t have a white van. I don´t drive. I don´t even have a licence. Reeboks? - Yeah. - What size shoe do you take? - Nine. - Are those nines? - Hello. - Hi Help yourself to a drink. I´ll be out in a minute. Do you want one? Yes Yes please Hi. - When do you want to eat? - Sometime soon. Er... do you want to pick something out? I haven´t had time. - I got really tied up with work. - Reading Whitehouse´s book? No. I just dug that out this afternoon. Well, when did you buy it? I don´t know. Soon after it came out, I think. Before we met? - Yes. - Why didn´t you tell me that you´d read it? - Why would I tell you? It was ages ago. - We were talking about it. I got it out because we were talking about it. - I didn´t even know you when I bought it. - But you´re reading it now? Are you researching me? Researching you? What are you talking about? Before we met, you read a book, and in it, I´m caricatured as a cold person obsessed by her career and turned on by murder. That description would turn any man off, except a therapist. Is that why you´re interested in me? No. I´m interested in you because you´re paranoid. Now, get some food ordered, please. I´d like to watch a movie. You know, I have no doubt that we put away the right man. I´m sure you did. - Morning. Is the chief in? - Yes. - He called in to say he wants to see you. - Good. Morning. What´s going on? Last night... I had see a member of your team in here... complaining that you are not conducting this investigation... I hope you showed Mitchell the door. No, I didn´t. Look, I´m investigating two murders, and he insists on investigating eight. How can you expect us to work together under that premise? I agree. It´s a very unsatisfactory situation, Jane, and one which results in this sort of thing, which we can all do without. God, one of those bastards is leaking information! I specifically asked for no details to be published. I´m taking you off the case. - What? - I´m getting a lot of pressure. - Who from? - It´s coming from the top. You´re doffing your cap to the most outrageous? I don´t have the argument to keep you on it. You´re vulnerable to accusations of not having an open mind. - I can´t ignore that. - You know Marlow is guilty. They are not my rules, Jane. Ah... Who´s taking my place? - Mitchell. He´ll be acting superintendent. - Mitchell is absolutely the wrong person. You must know that. He´s leading those lads down a false trail. If you don´t bring me back on the case, there´ll be no-one left to bring them back on line. - I went back to the lockup yesterday. - Yes. Haskons told me. Haskons? Are you trying to humiliate me? - Come on, Jane! - You should be defending me. I want you to look at these child protection budgets and give me a report on them by Friday. I´ll sharpen my pencils. Right, Jason, bring Andreas Hulenkinis in and put him straight in the interview room. - Colin, shoe prints. - We´ve eliminated all but two: A Size 8 Reebok trainer and a Size 10 man´s shoe with a flat heel. - Are we sure it´s an 8? - No doubt about it. Hulenkinis is a 9. Check it out. And check out the uncle too. In fact, bring him in as well. - The van. Andy? - No joy at all. Nobody in the vicinity owns or has hired a white van, or has noticed one in the area. Maybe it was stolen. There´s no other explanation why it was there. None at all. Any connection between Hulenkinis and the van? - Not yet. - Right. - Catherine, perfume? - Yeah. Pearson´s sell 5,000 bottles of this gardenia stuff every year, but fortunately, none of the main retailers stock it, although they do have 415 outlets for their products throughout the country. Now, 243 of them currently stock gardenia. - Right. - This is the printout. It´s mostly small chemists, beads and bangles sort of shops. We contacted all of them. They´re going to keep a record of purchases. - I think we could be lucky. - Good. Well done. Richard... Christine´s abduction. She set off from her friend Gemma´s house at five. ´Scuse me. Walking along Greystone Road, here. She would then have turned left down Church Street, right down Vincent Road, taking her to her home in Poplar Avenue here. We´ve two possible sightings of her on Greystone Road, but nothing after that, so we´ve been trying to identify vehicles seen in the vicinity... around the time she set off home. At 5:00pm, a 60-year-old woman was pulling out of a parking space, causing, what she says was a uniformed policeman in an unmarked car, to suddenly stop. She thinks there was someone in the back seat, but she can´t give any description. We haven´t been able to identify either the car - a silver saloon or hatchback - or the officer involved. But it would explain why Christine might get into a car with a stranger, if that stranger was using his uniform to entice her in on some pretence. Or we could be talking about a man impersonating a police officier. Well, yeah. It´s unlikely that Marjorie would get into a car if she didn´t know the driver. Yeah, well this is a lead we´ll have to follow to its conclusión, so I want to extend the investigation to all officers entitled to use the club. That´s the whole of the Metropolitan Police. You want the owners of silver saloons and hatchbacks. That will narrow the field. Do we get a warrant to search Hulenkinis´s house? Yeah. Andy, Jason, we´ll get that now. With a serial killer undetected, a police officer removed from the investigation, and the allegation of a cockup on a major case, you won´t be surprised to hear that the commissioner has had the Home Secretary on the phone, wanting to know what the hell is going on. - I was... - In order to prepare... in the event of an appeal, I´m asking you, David, to look at the allegations into the Marlow conviction on an informal basis - and to report to me as soon as possible. - Yes, of course, sir. You´ll have access to everything you require. And, confidentiality will be assured. I want a full and frank report. - Yes sir - With respect, sir, this will be a complete waste of time. I was Tennison´s super on that case, and I will tell you that we put away the right man. I´m looking for an independent view, Mike. If it´s the Home Secretary you want off your back, then David should be finding out who is leaking information to Whitehouse. That´s the problem. That´s been taken up by the super at Camden. Is Superintendent Tennison to be informed of what I´ll be doing? No. At this stage, I want everything off the record. And if I was to find evidence that points to a miscarriage of justice? The commissioner will inform the Home Office. Yeah, of course. And if there´s been no miscarriage of justice, but there... ...there has been unprofessional behaviour in Tennison? Then I will certainly want to know about it. - Cheers. - Cheers. I´m afraid that I´ve got a confessión to make. Well, if it´s bad news, I don´t want to hear it. OK. Well, what is it? Well. When you went to sleep on the sofa last night... - Oh, I´m sorry about that. - Oh, no. I... picked up your papers on Marlow. - My file? - I know, I know. I apologise. Just bear with me for a minute. I think I may have found something very interesting. Now... Now, in the pathologist´s report on Marlow´s last victim, Karen... Karen Howard. Perfume was noted to be about her body. I made a copy of the page. Unfortunately, it doesn´t mention what kind of perfume. - How´s that supposed to help me? - I know, I know. Now, this is a copy of the inventory of everything that was found in the lockup. There. "One bottle, empty, Pearson´s Scents of Old England... ...gardenia." Oh, my God... Why wasn´t I aware of that? For the simple reason that it was found in Della Mornay´s handbag, and you´d have presumed it was her perfume. I then checked on the reports... on the four women who´d been killed up north. I quote... "A sweet and heady perfume was described as being on Ellen Harding´s body. " Now, she was a prostitute, so that´s not altogether surprising, but once you start piecing it all together... I´m sure there was no mention of a perfume in Whitehouse´s book. No, there wasn´t. I checked. - So these can´t be copycat killings. - I always thought that was unlikely. Whoever´s doing it must have inside information. And who has access to that information other than you? Well, anyone who´s got access to the file, which means any officer. Of course, they could be getting the information from Marlow himself... or from Whitehouse. - That´s very unlikely. - Why? Do you know him personally? No. Well, obviously, I know who he is. Is Marlow getting someone to kill on his behalf? Even if he is, you still haven´t proved the perfume connection as yet. The more obvious conclusión is, wich is why I said it might be bad news, is that um... ...you did get it wrong, and that eight murders have been committed that have absolutely nothing to do with George Marlow. - No, I´m not going to believe that. - I know you don´t want to, but... I got the right man, and now, it seems I´ve got to prove it all over again, so, you tell me, why would Marlow have used the same perfume on his victims time and time again? Jane, I´ve just told you what I think, but you´re not listening to me. Come on, Patrick, you´re the expert in all this. Tell me, what am I looking for? I don´t know, some traumatic event, something from childhood. - Such as? - I don´t know, something unpleasant. - It could be child abuse... - Patrick, why are you being so difficult? No, I am not being difficult. I just don´t want to see you wasting your time. Well, let me worry about that, so just tell me. All right. It´ll either be something... he witnessed or something that was done to him. Whatever it was, it´ll be... sexual in origin. Thank you. But you still think I´m wrong, don´t you? So it would appear that the police have made a major mistake? What it appears we are uncovering, Michael, is yet another miscarriage of justice, and I heard this evening that the officer in charge of the investigation, and who was also in charge of the Marlow investigation, has been taken off the case, which indicates that the police are coming to terms with the fact... that they put away the wrong man. Have you actually met George Marlow, Mr Whitehouse? Yes, I have. Many times. - In prison, presumibly. - Yes. He´s never given up hope that the truth... will one day come out and he´ll be released, and he will be. Once the Home Secretary allows his appeal, the conviction will be quashed. I´m sure of that. Yes, I´ll make sure she gets the message. OK. Thank you. Goodbye. - Are these the budgets? - Yes. What time is the chief´s first meeting? Um... 10:30. Guv, DCI MitchelI´s just rung. He wants the Marlow file urgently. Apparently you´ve got it. Oh, shit. Well, it´s at home. - Oh, no, it´s not. - They need it this morning. Hi. This is Dr Patrick Schofield. If you´d like to leave your name and number, I´ll get back to you as soon as I can. Hi, Patrick. This is Mark Whitehouse. Can you meet me in the lounge bar of the Camden Lock Hotel this evening? I´ll be there from seven. Thanks. Hi, Patrick This is Mark Whitehouse. Can you meet me in the lounge bar of the Camden Lock Hotel this evening? I´ll be there from seven. Thanks. - Have you interviewed this... Andreas chap? - Yeah, we´ve had him in. And Takis, his uncle. Their only alibi is each other. Also, Andreas wears a Size 9 shoe. There´s no evidence yet to link either or both of them, but er... give us time. Can you find anything to link either of them with Marlow´s murders? I can´t comment on that yet, but I´ve listened to Whitehouse´s taped conversations with Marlow´s former girlfriend, Moyra Henson. I wouldn´t like to give an opinion on her honesty, but what I can say... is that the more I open up Tennison´s investigation of Marlow, the more suspect it appears to be. I think it´s time to consider, if not assume, that you´re now dealing with victims number seven and eight. The four-year gap between the last two killings in ´91 and these two should certainly be investigated. We should be asking ourselves why these murders have now started again. Was the killer in jail from ´91, and has only just been released? Has he been assaulting but not murdering women during that period? Were there other victims but the bodies have not been found? If your investigation continues to ignore these possibilities, you could be making a very grave error. Do you think we should open up the investigation? Yes, I do. Tom? It´s always been my instinct to open it up, yeah. Jane. - I´ll be with you in a minute. - Right. Have we found out who´s been leaking information to Whitehouse? I´m taking these home. - Did you manage to get the file? - It´s on my desk. OK, listen up. Chief Superintendent Kernan and I have decided to open this investigation up to include the possibility of Marjorie and Christine being victims seven and eight... Nice one! The first..... six previously attributed to George Marlow. This does not mean that Marlow is necessarily innocent of those six murders. We have to look at everything, so I shall put a team onto finding out where our killer might have been... between ´91 and now. I want all serious non-domestic assaults on women in the London area since ´91 checked, all serious sex offenders who have done time in that period... and have since been released checked. That´s a hell of a lot of work for a long shot. It´s a hell of a lot of work, and I want you to head it. We´ve got enough to do, checking the Met. Are you giving some more... There are no extra resources, so split your team in two. - OK? Let´s get on with it. - Nice one, guv. Richard? Richard, thanks for coming. I´ve got to pick the kids up in half an hour. Yeah, I know. I´m sorry. Look, I need something from you. - Can I trust you? - Of course you can. You told Kernan about us going to that lockup together. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I remember. So, can I trust you? Yeah. Give me a cigarette, would you? Look, I need to know what´s going on with this case. Will you tell me? Yeah. Yeah. MitchelI´s brought in Andreas and his uncle... for questioning, but there have been no charges, and he´s opened up the investigation to include Marlow´s murders. Well, I need to know who Marlow associated with in prison and what happened to those men since they´ve been released. Can you get that information for me? Yeah, I can do that. - Anything else? - No. No, that´s all. - I´d better go. - OK Are you staying here? - Yeah. - Are you driving? Yes. Can I have a large whisky, please? - I´ll buy that. - No, you won´t. That´s £3.80, please. Mark Whitehouse. Thank you. You´re expecting Patrick Schofield. He´s not coming. Ah. I didn´t think this was a coincidence. Well, shall we sit down? Sure. Why did you write a book saying Marlow was innocent when you know he´s guilty? I believe he is innocent. Finding a cause célébre is very fashionable. I try not to be too cynical about police procedures and motives. Some of you have exposed miscarriages of justice, but your book is the most poisonous piece of rubbish I´ve ever read. Well, thank you. Why do you want to free a murderer who´s killed six women and on the most distorted piece of evidence? I actually came upon the story by chance. I was doing an article on life in a hospice. One of the patients was Moyra. We got talking and I became aware that here was a key witness in a murder trial, telling me the opposite of what she´d told the court. She told me the statements she made to you the police were made under duress, and that the evidence against George had been fabricated. What was I supposed to do with that information? Go away and forget it? So, I did some investigating, and where I could check her story, she was telling the truth. Did you record your conversations with Moyra? Yes. Do you still have the tapes? - I have my own copy, yes. - Can I hear them? Of course not. What is your connection with Patrick Schofield? Just that we share a mutual interest in miscarriages of justice. Good night. Piss off. Look... - Bloody hell! - Get in. Get in. How did you know where to find me? How was your meeting? - What meeting? - You want to be more careful. And how did you know that I? An informal investigation into Marlow´s murders has been requested. I´m telling you this in absolute confidence, you understand. Now, I know you got it right, and I want you to know you have my support, providing you are careful about what you do and who you see. So, how did you know that I had a meeting with Whitehouse? I was talking about your meeting with Haskons. Just be careful, Jane. And I haven´t told you this. - Hello? - Hi. It´s me. How are you? - I´m at the Hotel. - OK. I just wanted to give you a good night call. Thanks. So, were you asleep? Um... yeah, almost. Oh, I´m sorry. - It´s lonely in Leeds without you. - It´s OK. The lecture went very well today. Good Did you see Kernan? Why? I just wondered if you´d told him about the perfume. - Why did you want to know that? - There´s no reason. I was just interested. What´s the matter? Are you OK? I´m... I´m just tired, that´s all. I´m sorry. Listen, I´ll let you go back to sleep. I´m going to be back about six tomorrow evening. Do you want to meet up? - I won´t be here. - Why? Where are you off to? - I can´t tell you. - Why? - I can´t talk about it. - Are you going to be away all night? I... I might be. I don´t know. Will you call me when you do know? JAne, are you there? Why did you lie to me? - Why did I do what? - You know what I´m talking about. Hello. Why aren´t you at school? Have you seen my mum? Has she ever been late from the shops before? No. - Where does your dad work? - I don´t know. - Yeah. We´re in Blenheim Avenue. - He works at Pluto Plastics... ... based in Dunstable. - He doesn´t live here. - Do you sometimes see your dad? - Yes. - Do you want us to contact him for you? Please contact Pluto Plastics. Is your dad´s name Matthews as well? - Yes. - What´s his first name? - James. - Yeah, James Matthews. Pluto Plastics in Dunstable. Her name is Lynn Matthews. Dressmaker. Works from home. Separated from her husband. One daughter. Kate aged 12 We don´t know for certain that she´s been abducted, but no-one we have spoken to could give us any reason... as to why she would voluntarily have disappeared. If this is our man, and he follows the pattern of the other murders, then we have three days to find her alive. Can I help you? - I´ve come to see Doris Marlow. - They´re out for the afternoon. Oh. When will they be back? They´ve gone to a show on the front. Who are you? My name´s Jane. I´m a friend of the family. You should have waited at reception. Yes. I know. I´m sorry. There was no-one around so I just popped up. It´s all right. I´ll... I´ll come back later. - Did you get anything? - There´s nothing from the house-to-house. What? Has nobody seen anything? We´re doing the houses again this evening. Why don´t we put the daughter on the TV? Talk to her chaperone. Get checkpoints organised in Denbury Road and Harrow Street tomorrow. We should look at the prisoners Marlow´s been with since he´s been inside. - Why? - Maybe Marlow´s orchestrating these murders. - This isn´t a priority. - Rather than waste my time... Just do as I bloody well say! See you later. Got your programme? - Doris Marlow? - Yes. - Hello, Doris. - Who are you? I´m Jane. I´m a friend of your son, George. Oh, is it Moyra? No, Jane. Oh, yes, Jane. How nice! Come and give me a kiss. - Oh, cold cheeks. - How are you? - Are you looking after him? - George? Oh, yes. I really should be getting her onto the coach. He can´t visit me any more. Yes, I know. Do you mind if I have a few words with her? I´ve just come up from London and I´m only here for the day. Um... I´ll tell you what. I´ll finish getting the others in first. - Thanks. - I´ll be back in a minute. I thought you were dead. I bought you a present. Oh, how kind! How nice! - Is George coming? - No. No, I didn´t think he was. - No. He isn´t able to visit. - I´m sure I know you. - Do you like this perfume? - I do know you. It´s gardenia. Shall I open it for you? - What´s it doing here? - It´s a present. Now I remember. Do you like it? - Have I had my tea? - No. Do you like it? Yes. Frederick used to buy that for me. Is Frederick your husband? Terribly naughty. - Why? Who´s Frederick? - Every Friday, down on the pier. - More often than not. - Was Frederick your lover? Oh, yes. Did I? Did I have an ice cream? No. I don´t know. So, was this your special perfume? I´m sorry, but I have to get her on the coach now. Is it all right if I take her out for tea? She said she´d like that. I´m not sure that would be allowed. I´d have to check it out with the manager. I mean, we don´t know who you are. I know who this young lady is. I saw you there. She´s George´s girlfriend, a lovely girl. You must have a lot of memories here. Well, what do I know about that? - With Frederick. - Not Frank. Was it romantic with Frederick? Well, we had our way here a few times, I suppose. Secret liaison? When are you taking me back? - Did Frank know? - Frank? Bonehead. Did George know? What´s that to do with you? George is a very dear friend of mine. He wanted me to bring you out this afternoon. - I don´t expect this place has changed much. - Not here! - Why not here? - Not here! - Did George follow you here one night? - Never marry. Did George follow you here one night? - Frank got him up. - His father sent him? - Take me home! - Yes. All right, all right. How old was he then? He was always asleep when I left. - Take me home! - All right. All right, we´re going. Frank got him up. A little boy, got him dressed and sent him here. - I want to go home. - All right. All right, we´re going now. Does he get his sweets? - Come in. - Thanks. Did you get my message? Yes, I did. So, what´s the problem? Good evening, madam. We´re enquiring into the disappearance of Mrs Lynn Matthews in this vicinity sometime after 8:15 this morning. Hi Hi. What are you doing here? - I was hoping you might want some company. - If I want company, I´ll call you. So, why don´t you tell me what all this was about the other night? I think you should go. What is this, Jane? How´s your friend Mark? Mark? Mark who? - Mark Whitehouse. - I´ve no idea. I´ve never met him. Why couldn´t you tell me what you were doing? - What am I doing? - You tell me. - I just told you, I´ve never met him. - Don´t give me that. I heard the message, Patrick. "Hi, Patrick. This is Mark. " - If you must know, I´m writing a book. - Oh, about what? She may be a lousy detective, but she´s a good shag? You shouldn´t listen to my messages. That isn´t how I feel. - Well, how do you feel? - I´m telling you... if you´d just shut up and listen. I was asked to write a book some time ago about why miscarriages of justice... Why am I in this book if it´s about errors of judgment? - Why are you? You´re not in this book. - Why have you got a file on me? - Research which I am no longer using. - Well, who is? - Who´s what? - Who´s using the research? - No-one is using the research. - Oh, come on! Whitehouse is. Whitehouse has never seen that file. Let me explain something to you. We both share the same publisher, and because of that, Whitehouse has found out about... - Oh, Patrick, you think I´m going to believe? - He wants to write an article round it. That´s why he left the message on my machine. I have never spoken to the man. I´ve been away. I haven´t even returned his call as yet. You understand what I´m saying? How am I supposed to know if you´re telling the truth? Well... sometimes you have to trust people. Trust people? You must be joking. In my job, that´s an impossibility. I´m telling you. You are never going to sort out any of your relationships until you find some way of separating your private life from your work. Oh, "Don´t take your job too seriously because you know you only want to get married"? Oh, don´t insult my intelligence. You´ll never learn anything about yourself because you interpret everything anyone says about as a personal attack. What is it with you? What is it? There´s some kind of machismo that´s driving you through everything that you do. It´s patently obvious that you don´t enjoy it, but you seem to be incapable of resisting it. - Do not talk to me as if I´m one of your psychos! - One of my what?! I´m very tired and I want you to go, and I´ve gone off this idea of having each other´s keys, so, here you are, there´s yours back and I´d like mine back, please. OK. And, by the way, that´s the file that you´ve been so bothered about. I thought I´d bring it round. Today, I proved all over again that Marlow did kill those six women. Good, then you should be celebrating. - I am. - Hmm. You´ve got a visitor. What are you doing here? It can´t be business if you´re off the case. It seems like it´s only you and me left... ...who know for certain you killed six women. No, thank you. Filthy habit. Did you come all the way up here to tell me that? Someone is copying your murders. I need to know who. How am I supposed to know? Who did you tell, George? How am I supposed to answer that? I know the women you killed were prostitutes, or you thought they were. These women aren´t. It´s a 53-year-old widow, a 16-year-old schoolgirl. These aren´t women you meant to kill. Is anyone going to convince you that I´m an innocent man? I know you´re being copied and I know you´re being copied by someone who has access to evidence that could only have come from yourself. What evidence is that? The killer souses his victims with perfume. Gardenia perfume. And? So did you, George. You must know that a third woman has gone missing. She´s a loving, caring, faithful woman. Tell me who´s committing these murders and stop him before she joins the list. For God´s sake, will you just accept that you made a mistake? Give me the opportunity to go back to a court of law and prove it. I went to see your mother yesterday. - What? - I went up to Blackpool to visit her. You what? She´s an old lady. She´s a sick old lady. What did you say to her? I had to see her because you won´t tell me the truth. - What did you say? - Who´s killing them? What are you doing, seeing my mother? I took her for a walk on the seafront. - How dare you visit her? - I took her to the pier. - You see, I know, George. - You bitch! - Who´s killing them? - If you´ve upset her... - Tell me, George. - If you have upset her... Ask me what I know about Frederick. What did you see when your dad sent you down to the pier, George? Hmm? Was she lying down? Was he on top of her, legs in the air? Or did he have her up against the railings? Did she see you standing there? Was he laughing? Did she try and pull her knickers up? Did she shout at you to go away? - Let me out of here! - Was your dad pleased when you got home? - Let me out of here! - Was he smiling? Three sales reported, none in the London area, all negative. Right. Richard, anything there? - No. - We´ve got the van. What size? Yeah. Yeah, OK. All right. Thanks. Shit. It belongs to an art student in Falmouth. She´d been to a party with her boyfriend and they´d stopped for a piss on the way home. The boyfriend wears a Size 8 Reebok jogging trainer. That just leaves us with a Size... ...10 shoe, a possible lift from the police club... and a possible sighting of a police officer in Greystone Road. - How are we getting on with that list? - Still checking out the duty rosters. Richard, um... you get your team back onto helping Colin. You can return to that work as soon as you´ve cleared everyone. Is anyone checking out the list of cons that Marlow´s been in contact with since he went inside? The police are certain that Lynn Matthews... ...who disappeared from near her home in Willesden has been abducted. At a news conference this morning... - Hello? - Superintendent Tennison? - Speaking. - I have Commander Trayner for you. Thank you. - Jane? - Yes, sir? How long will it take you to get to my office? Come in. Do sit down. Can you confirm that you visited George Marlow in prison this morning? - I discov... - Can you please answer the question. - Yes, I did. - Marlow made a complaint to the governor... ...that you interrogated him concerning an investigation from which you had been removed. - I think, under the circumstances... - Is that true? - Did you interrogate Marlow... - Yes, I did. ...on a matter concerning an investigation from which you had been removed? This is not a discussión. Answer the questions directly as I put them to you. Did you inform Marlow that a certain perfume had been used on the bodies of Christine Bramwell and Marjorie Miller? Yes, sir. Are you aware of the fact that the officer in charge of the investigation, Acting Superintendent Mitchell, had asked for that information not to be divulged? - No, that was my... - Just answer the question! Yes, sir. Marlow is now free to pass on that information to any journalist wishing to contact him. - I don´t think he´ll want to give that... - Will you shut up and listen?! These are serious disciplinary matters. Furthermore, Marlow is taking his complaint to his member of parliament, the last thing we all wanted. And as for justifying your interference, may I remind you that you were taken off the case because your judgement has become clouded? - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. I have absolutely no choice but to suspend you from all duties. Please give me you warrant card. I shall, of course, vindicate myself at the earliest opportunity. Your suspensión starts as from now. Hello? It´s Richard, guv. I´m sorry to call you this early. What´s it about? Can I see you? Not really, no. It´s important. - Where are you? - Opposite. The phone booth opposite. Oh, shit. - All right, I´ll put the coffee on. - Thanks. Oh, bloody hell. Well, you don´t look any better than I do. Yeah, well, I´ve been working all night. Right, what do you want? I´ve been working on that list of cons Marlow has been in company with since he´s been inside. No.1 topped himself two years ago. Two´s a grass, now out of the country. - Three Andrew... - No, that was child offences. Yeah. All No.4´s offences were homosexual, all in the ´60s and he´s now 71 years old. Five is our possible. Raymond Harding... I remember that name. He spent a year in the Scrubs on B Wing with Marlow. His mother died a year ago. Lives alone in a house in Cricklewood. - Have you told Mitchell about this? - Yeah. He told me not to investigate. Well... So, you haven´t seen this man? No. - Well, you must. - I feel out on a limb on this. This investigation´s a mess. No-one´s got a focus on anything. We´re trying to cover too much ground. We don´t have enough officers. We don´t have enough time. We´re into the third day of this woman´s disappearance. You don´t expect me to go with you, do you? - Mr Raymond Harding? - Yes. Detective Inspector Haskons. I´d like to ask you a few questions. - Can we come in? - Yeah. I´ll get him! Ow! Watch it! Get off! I was only holding it for a pal of mine. What have you got? Every one of you who worked on that list has done a fantastic job. It´s something none of us like to do, but you´ve done it with superb professionalism. Now, we have five suspects. One is a Superintendent, two are sergeants, and two are constables, one of whom is at this station. I don´t need to remind you of the sensitivity that is required. These officers are, if not your friends, your colleagues, and are, most probably, innocent. However, I want a thorough search in every case. Moyra. Patrick! - Patrick, I need to talk! - What about? - Can you get in the car? - Why? What do you want to talk about? - What the bloody hell are you doing? - Oh, I´m sorry. - You can´t just stop in the middle of the street. - I said I´m sorry. - I´ve got your number, arsehole. - Oh, shut up. - You´re a witness to that. - I didn´t see anything. - Patrick, where does Whitehouse live? - Oh, for... Oh, please, can you find out? - No. - Don´t you share the same publisher? - Yes we do, but they don´t give out private numbers. - If he can get your number, can´t you get his? Of course, I told you but I´m not interested. Now, I´d like to get these things inside. Patrick, I need your help. Would Marlow have used the same perfume on Moyra? - You mean like he used it on his victims? - Yes In her statement to me, she said that he once tied her up and humiliated her. - Well, it´s possible. - If she knew about it, who could she have told? - You got a phone in there? - Yeah. - Morning. - Morning. Are you getting rid of her today? This is the third day, isn´t it? It´s only me who knows, and what am I going to do? I can´t do it. - What can´t you do? - I can´t go on with it. - Where is she now? - Somewhere. - She still alive? - Yeah. Yeah. Why can´t you do it? I don´t... have any strength. Yes, you do. You do. You´ve got to dispose of her now you´ve got this far. You have to now. - I can´t go down there. - Where? - Where she is. - Well, what else can you do? I don´t know. - I can´t think about it. - You´ve got to think about it. - Is she in the house? - Yeah. Well... you can´t just leave her there. - I´ll walk away. - You don´t have to go on with this any more. But you´ve got to take care of this one. Then you can stop. - What time do you clock off? - I´m going home now. Then do it now. Go home and do it now. It´s just another job that has to be done. Then it´s over. OK I´ll do it now. - Are you sure you want me to come in with you? - Yes. I´d be very careful in there if I were you or you´re going to find yourself out of a job. I´m out of a job anyway. I´m resigning. - I won´t be long, love. - Yes, all right. - I´ll draw something like that. - Are you going to draw some more? - Come in. - Thank you. So, what can I do for you? I´m sorry, this has nothing to do with me. Jane wanted to ask you some questions, if that´s all right. In your conversations with Moyra, did she ever confide in you that Marlow sprayed his victims with perfume? Of course not. She always maintained he was innocent. I wouldn´t have written the book otherwise. - But you knew about the perfume, didn´t you? - Which perfume? The special perfume that Marlow sprayed his victims with. I know about the gardenia found on the last two victims. Are you trying to tell me Marlow used it as well? Yes, and we now know why he used it, so, did Moyra tell you about the perfume? If you think you´ve found another way of rubbishing my book... - I don´t give a toss about that piece of crap. - That´s it. I want you out. Mark, Mark, Mark... Moyra must have told somebody about the perfume. - Please, it´s important. - I think you´ve now got me under suspición. - How can I take you seriously? - If she didn´t tell you, who did she tell? Why don´t you listen? I would not have written the book. This is the third day that Lynn Mattews has been missing. We´re running out of time here. So, who else did she confide in before she died? - She won´t do that, cos she don´t listen. - She never do listen. - No. Oh, I saw Darren last night at the club. - He´s a waste of space anyway. Yeah, I know, but he´s not a prat. Three ciders, right, wallop, wallop, wallop. Where was Steve, then? - Oh, he was there. - Oh, yeah? What did he say? - Oh, he´s had his hair cut. - No! Oh, honestly, you´ve got to see it. I mean, it´s just unbelievable. 5p change. There you go. Richard, let´s get working on that list of Marlow´s prison contacts. Guv, it´s Detective Superintendent Tennison. We´ve got him! Colin! Richard! Andy! Let´s go! That´s it. - Where is she?! - Upstairs? No! Not in here! - What´s this for? - Outside and down the steps. It´s all right. We´re police. We´ve got an ambulance coming. There you go, love. You´re all right. Why did you start killing, Len? Hmm? Did Marlow persuade you? - No. - Did he know it was you? Yes. Couldn´t believe his luck. Did things start going wrong three years ago when your wife left you? I don´t know. I started... to see things different. - What things? - Everything. You mean, like some of the men you were guarding, like Marlow? Maybe. Is that why you used perfume? Did Moyra tell you about the perfume? - Yeah. - What did she tell you? She told me George used to... ...s- spray it... ...on... on their bodies. - Whose bodies? - The women he killed. Why did Moyra tell you that? She was lonely. When she used to visit George, the journey was very long and tiring for her. She was very ill. I used to... put her up. We became friends, and she told me then. And then Moyra died. Yes. And then did you start thinking about what George did to the women? Yes. I wanted... to know what it felt like. And what did it feel like? Hell. I felt... ...like I´d fallen into hell. - So you did it again? - Yes. - And again. - Yes. And are you still in hell? Yes. Your removal from the investigation by Chief Superintendent Kernan... ...was correct in the circumstances known at that time. Your behaviour subsequent to that action was, however, a serious breach of procedure and discipline, and, Detective Superintendent, you should have known better. The decisión to suspend you was, again, correct procedure, as you were and are well aware. But, again, your behaviour subsequent to your suspensión was a serious breach of procedure an discipline. Your standard of behaviour... is not the standard expected of a senior police officier. However due to your actions resulting in the satisfactory rescue of Mrs Linda Matthews, the board have considered that your punishment will be taken no further than a reprimand. Is there anything you wish to say? No, sir. And? A perfectly-phrased bollocking. What about your resignation? Oh, I forgot to mention that. - What? - I knew you weren´t going to resign. - Oh, did you, smartarse? - Of course I did. - Anyway, I didn´t want you to. - Yes, you do. You keep saying I´ve got to make a space for a relationship. I didn´t mean that kind of space. - Anyway, you´re not perfect. - I didn´t say anything. You´re a know-it-all and you analyse everything. We´re a perfect pair, aren´t we? - How did you know I wasn´t going to resign? - Because I´m very clever. Besides, we need the money. I sat there watching them decide on my future, and I thought, "I should be making those decisions. " I fought all the bloody battles. Oh, if it means working with people like Trayner and Thorndike, then I´ll just have to do it, won´t I? That´s good. We´ve got our AMIP anniversary tonight. - Will you come with me? - No. I´m busy. # Soothing classical music Terrific lady. You might just be in line for a very good apology. - Have a good night. - Cheers. What was that about? Was he talking about a promotion? He´s drunk and he´s feeling guilty. I never told you but I got a visit from Thorndike. - When? - Just after you were taken off the case. Why did he want to see you? He wanted me to keep an eye on you. Inform on me? He said he was very concerned about your welfare and your workload. That kind of thing. What he wanted to know was whether or not you thought you´d made a mistake about Marlow and if you had, what were you going to do about it? The slimy little shit! Excuse me. Good evening, gentlemen. Having a nice time? David, do you fancy a dance? I´d be delighted. - Did you hear about the results of my tribunal? - Yes. Congratulations. It´s reassuring to know you have the support and the confidence of one´s colleagues. Know what makes you such an arsehole, David? You think that you have the right to go into my private life to discredit me. I´ve taken a lot of crap over the years, but, really, this time, you´ve surpassed it all. It didn´t work, did it? You see, I´m still here. I´ve spoilt it for you. You can´t get rid of me no matter how hard you try. Jane, no-one has ever had any intention of getting rid of you. How have things been treating you? Nice to see such a fulsome embrace into the fold, David. No hard feelings. Certainly not on my part anyway.
