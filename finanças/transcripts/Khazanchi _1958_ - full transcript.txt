You Tube - Video Running Time 02:26:31 You Tube search name - Khazanchi {HD} - M. Ismail - S.D. Narang - Ramola Devi - Old Hindi Full Movie -(With Eng Subtitles) Move out of the way! Hey! - Damn! Damn! Damn! - What happened? - I dropped my wallet. Usha! Usha, dear... - Usha! - Give her some air. Thank you! - Where am I? - By the riverside. You are... who are you? Er... My name is Harish, height 5 feet 9 inches, chest 40 inches. Dear Usha, our boats collided. How are you? I'm absolutely fine. Please let me get up. No, no, do, don't move. The pain will only worsen. - I'm not in distress. - But I am. - Oh... - What happened? - What happened? - The pain has increased. - Where's it hurting? - Here... here... No, no... here... here... It began in my stomach... in my stomach; oh, look, it's moving upwards to my chest. Oh... my heart! - Oh, my poor heart! - Oh, my heart... - Oh, my poor heart... - What rubbish! Nonsense! Let me go! Let me go! You are Miss Usha Rani, the only daughter of Rai saab Devi Chand. - Where have you been? - Er... er... I'd gone boating on the river. And the waves, separated for years, jumped up to hug you? And muck rained from far-off skies... that ruined your clothes? - That... we had an accident... a collision... - Of course! How could you not collide? I can tell that this collision will ruin Rai Saheb's honor one day. - Are you listening? - Eh? Well done. Where're you going with your head held up high? I'm only her step-mother, but if blood relatives don't speak up, I'll have to. Ask her where she'd gone! Ask her! Tell me, my dear, what happened? Is this any way to ask her? Respectable families would have skinned her alive. They would have broken her knees so she wouldn't step out again. Can't you talk calmly for once? You're short-tempered all the time. Step-mothers are also mothers. She's your daughter just as much as she's mine. This is exactly why she's so spoiled. I'm her age too. I've desires as well, but I curb them. Are you doing me a favor? I married you. I didn't borrow you from anyone. Mark my words, if you value your reputation, then use your brains. The past can never be changed. You'll regret this all your life. - My dear, you're answerable only to me. - Daddy... A man who dies without a son to succeed him is said to be unfortunate. I married again only because of this, my dear. Daddy! Gita... Hey, what happened? Did you dive into a rain-filled ditch? - Or play kabbadi in the gutters? - Speak softly! If father hears you, I'll be in trouble. As it is, I'm late. - Who's it, my dear? - N... no one, father. The washerman brought the clothes. Hey, washerman's sister, give me my clothes. I'll change right here. Not so fast. First, tell me... where you celebrated this unseasonal Holi? - I didn't play Holi. - Then, was it hide and seek? Not Holi, not hide and seek... we had an accident. - Accident? - Yes, our boat collided with another boat. Not a boat with a boat, but a boat collided with a ship. The boat came from here, the ship from there... The boat surged ahead, the ship made a noise, they collided, both went around in circles... No more going on the river. I'll tell father. Hey, I didn't have an accident. Someone else did. And to rescue that somebody, I'd to jump into the river. Well done, you valiant man! But... who was this 'somebody'? You don't know her. - But you do. Right? - God knows who she was! - I mean, who 'he' was. - Ha! Caught you red-handed, brother. Tell me, what 'her' name is. I don't know. Wow! You saved this 'somebody's' life... and 'somebody' didn't even tell you her name? I don't believe it. She fell and you jumped... she yelled, you turned; she was drowning, but you got there... and you saved her life. All this took around 10 minutes. You're back after two hours. When did Harish say he would return? - You get ready, father. He's... - Hey... what are you doing? Give me my clothes, and go away. Go away. Go! I meant to say you get dressed, he will be coming soon. - How do you know? - Isn't he my brother? If he steps into the locality, I can sniff out his arrival. Sorry, father, I'm a little late. Sorry, my foot! We'd told them we would be there at 4. - 2 hours late for the first meeting? - Let's go, father. We'll soon be there. Alright, my dear, we'll be late back. Light the Diwali lamps, okay? And yes, don't forget to light the lamp near the holy basil. And you must remember to bring back sweets, father. My friends are coming over to celebrate Diwali. Your friends are coming, not your wedding procession, right? The festival of lights is here Look at the radiance it brings The lamps of joy brighten every home... These rows of lamps put the sun to shame It's rare that such seasons of brightness appear Come, my friend, come... Tonight, win your beloved's heart, or lose yours to him The festival of lights is here Look at the radiance it brings The lamps of joy brighten every home... These small showers of light create a riot of colors Lamps brighten every step like a garden of fireflies Come, my friend, come... Tonight, let's openly play the game of desire The festival of lights is here Look at the radiance it brings The lamps of joy brighten every home Harish, you carry on, son. I'll just go to the temple. Uff! Are these girls or an express train? They run out without looking. Pick up the bags. - Uh, where's father? - He's gone to the temple. He'll be back soon. Just pick up these things. Do you know where we'd gone? Khari Baoli, Chandni Chowk, Paratha Gully, somewhere around here. - No, no, no! - Then where did you go? If you knew, you'd be thrilled... and dance with joy. I'll surely dance, but first tell me what you've accomplished. I've hit the bullseye. There will soon be music, a wedding procession... sweets will be distributed. Oh, really? So my sister-in-law is arriving? Congratulations, dear brother, congratulations! How is she? Made in Madras? Or Kashmir? - I mean, is she fair or dark? - Sister-in-law? Yes, of course, sister-in-law. You will be at a loss for words when you see her. She's like a rose, like the full moon... She's coming to meet you next Wednesday. Oh ho! It's going to be a lot of fun. A king will turn into a slave. The man who orders his sister around will wait on his wife hand and foot. Now she will rule over this house. She'll be the queen and I'll be her prime minister. Then I'll see how you cross the borders without a passport. - Gita, my dear... - Go away. I won't talk to you. You surreptitiously met my sister-in-law, and didn't even tell me. Oh oh... Sister-in-law? You took him to see her! What does a bookworm know of love? If I'd met her, we could have squabbled... I'd have pinched her, she'd have caught me... we'd both have smiled. You should leave women's work to women, father. Today is Bhai Dooj. These people won't spare me even on a holiday. I wonder what's befallen the bank today. - Greetings, Mr. Cashier. - Banwari, you're a crook. - You want your penny daily. - Wonder how it gets dusty.. Here, go enjoy your holiday. Gentlemen, it's neither the bank's silver jubilee today... nor is it a farewall party for a manager. It is the magnetism of our Radhe Mohan... that has pulled us out of our homes on a holiday. Mr. Radhe Mohan, the custodian of our treasury... is such an honest man... that if everyone in the country were like him... people would sleep with open doors. The country would stop manufacturing locks. With our cashier's kind permission... I'd like to narrate an incident to you. Once his daughter fell ill with pneumonia. The date was the 30th. In 24 hours, it would be time to pay the salaries. He needed Rs.30. Had he wished, the cashier could have taken it from the bank's safe. He distributed the salaries. He could have taken Rs.30 less the next day. But, no. He pawned his watch for Rs.30. The next day, he reclaimed his watch for Rs.31. This paper proves this story. I'll not divulge how I got this paper. But, wrapped in this very paper... on behalf of Northern India Bank... I present this gold watch to our honorable cashier. Money fulfills man's needs. But integrity earns you honor, my dear. The day you become a lawyer... I'll place this watch in your pocket. So its ticking will remind you, even after my death... that integrity is the biggest treasure in the world. It's of use in both worlds. Who has seen the next world, Najjo? I swear upon your youth, if the custodian of death were to hear you sing... he too would wander aimlessly around Delhi for love of you. - Isn't that right sir? - You're too kind to say so, sir. So let's hear that song that made me restless with yearning. - God is pure. - Lord Shiva is great. - God is pure. - Come, destroyer of suffering. Take a seat. Don't be afraid, Najjo. They are enlightened souls. Their blessings can help you attain the impossible. Whatever I have is due to them. May you be blessed. - Salutations. - May you be blessed. Najjo Begum, these great men have come from beyond the icy mountains. Let's add some zing to this gathering, sir. It brought oppression, it brought tyranny... this cruel season of love What did I know about love? About the impish mischief that lights up the eyes? But, wounded in love, my heart told me... it understood what it meant for the world to end It brought oppression, it brought tyranny... this cruel season of love Strange indeed were the days of my youth My sanctuary was far beyond any bolts of lightning But once I attained the bloom of youth, oh, gracious... My peace of mind, indeed, my heart from my breast departed It brought oppression, it brought tyranny... this cruel season of love Where are those days of leisure... when I could sit awhile, to hold my breath? These ailments afflicted me since... the day I subsumed myself in your name It brought opression, it brought tyranny... this cruel season of love You were wonderful today, Begum! Wonderful! - The mind is pleased - The soul is at peace. This is Najjo. Those shooting stars that sometimes fall to the earth... come to self-destruct against the walls of her abode. And we applaud this very statement. After Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, this sense of humor... can only be heard here sometimes. What do you say, Khansaab? You took the words out of my mouth! Take this, Begum. My car will drop you home. Excuse me, Master. Now, we'll discuss religion and spirituality. Najjo Begum improved Loknath's life in this world. But only these men can improve my afterlife. You're right. - Let's make a move, Khansaab. - Yes, let's leave. Come, Bandhu miya, come, Kanan miya. Let's leave... - Come, my dear. Greetings, sirs. - May you be blessed. Come, my dear. Escuse me... Namaste. I'm presenting these Queen of the Night (night jasmine) blossoms during the day. These blossoms are slightly wilted at present. They regain their bloom at night... under the shadow of the stars. That room will fill with fragrance... where they abide, where you reside... - and perhaps, some day, I... - Nonsense! Arre... arre... excuse me, please listen to my dialogue... I made the great poet, D.N. Madhok, write it especially for you. Aunty! You are amazing, aunty. So this means what I heard is absolutely true? - Really? What have you heard? - The rumor in town is that... my aunt is more interested in her lipstick than in her husband. My family has suffocated me. But how can I deny myself the pleasures of youth? May you always remain young, aunty! But if you used your brains as much as you use your tongue... you'd have done better. Your husband has about Rs.6-7 lakhs in cash. As if I don't know. I know everything. Do you also know he's looking for a husband for Usha? No one else will be Usha's bridegroom but you. I don't want your Usha. The bride who comes to Loknath's house, will come alone. - Not with her father in tow. - What do you mean? I mean, they want a boy who... who will be Usha's dutiful husband and her father's obedient servant. Which means, that after marriage, all his wealth will be inherited by Usha... the father will live with Usha, and you? You will get a monthly pension of Rs.200. Pension? How's that possible? Hey, your fury will only fuel their victory. And your total defeat. Understood? Oh, just a minute. Here, take this. Take pleasure in these night jasmine blooms, and sing your nephew's praises. That whenever your nephew visits, he reveals confidential information. A-ha! I forgot to tell you one thing. Listen... hot news. I was coming, she was leaving... I stopped. She didn't. Then I presented her with these smiling blooms. She broke their hearts too, aunty! I'm tired of wooing her. Good bye! Arre, Loku! If I don't bring her and throw her at your feet... then my name is not lchhapuran Devi! Don't make promises, aunty. Just sit down. I know very well that this is not your cup of tea. - And who else can do something? - A bride is one whom the groom likes. The truth is... I don't care for your step-daughter... or for her father's wealth. All I want is... that you don't have to beg in future. You must know that your nephew always says something of great significance. What are you doing? Are you blind? Help! Someone, please help! I'm dead! I'm dead! Won't someone come to my aid? Please, someone, please help me! Help me! Please help me! Help! Help! Someone help me! Oh my god! I would have been dead today if God hadn't sent you. How do I thank you, son? There's no need for that. I only did my duty. Come, I'll take you home. Bravo. Yes, my dear, let's go. God! Thank you, my dear, thank you. Why don't you wash up while tea is being made? You'll feel fresh. I mean, you'll feel better. - Where's the bathroom? - Bathroom? Right there. Go straight, right to left, left to right... I mean... lll-mannered lout! Who are you? - You! - You...? - How did you get here? - What are you doing here? - I live here. - So this is your house. So this time, we both... had an accident in your house. An accident here, another accident there... I wonder why so many accidents occur! God works in mysterious ways. What do you think? I'll show you God's mysterious ways! - Softly, speak softly. That fat man is sitting there. - What did you say? - That's my daddy... - Really? - Who will have you arrested. - Really? - Usha, my child... - Coming, daddy! Let me get out of here. The police will throw you out, or daddy will kick you out. What made you come here! Why did you come? How did you come? How do I know how or why accidents occur? What had to happen has happened, Miss. - Usha, my dear... - Coming, daddy! - I don't know what to do. - Shall I tell you? - Go close daddy's eyes while I slip out. - Keep quiet! - Alright. - Where are you going? - I'm following you. - I'm going to daddy. - So I'll meet him too. If he asks who I am, tell him I'm your future... - What? - Oh, forgive me, I mean... - Do you want a whipping? - Keep quiet, and shut the door. - Thank you. Dear, please make some tea. Make it really special. Make it yourself, such that the aroma and color entrance you. - I'll just get it, daddy. - And listen, get some sweets too. - It's not often that such guests come home. - Okay. Come, my son, come. Have a seat. Tell me, what's your name? - Harish. - Excellent! What do you do? - I've just finished writing my law exams. - Excellent! - You'll definitely get through? I've never failed yet. Excellent! Then this means... that by next year, you will be practicing in the High Court. Not next year. Next month itself. Excellent! What's your father's name? Mr. Radhe Mohan. He's a cashier at the Northern India Bank. Excellent! So you're our cashier's son? Yes. Do you know him? Who doesn't know him? He's a great soul. People consider him second only to God. - Well done! What's wrong, dear? - Nothing, just an accident. This world, spinning, is also an accident, my son. Minor accidents occur almost daily here. Look at us. It was an accident that caused us to meet like this. - This is my daughter, Usha. - Greetings. - Greetings. She's written her BA exams this year. Well done! I suppose she will get through? - She has never failed yet. - Excellent! - Then she'll graduate next year. - Not next year, but next month. Excellent! See, if girls begin to be educated in this manner... our country will progress. When men begin to sit idly at home... then what can women do but help the country progress? - Well done! - Under these circumstances, I think I should make the tea. My dear, this is Harish, an upcoming lawyer. He saved my life today. Or I'd have suffered a terrible accident. - Accident? - Yes. Accident. You aren't hurt, are you, daddy? Hadn't it been for him, God knows what would have happened. Thank you very much. My dear, do switch on the radio to entertain our lawyer. Very well. Now, here, from our amateur program... listen to a song by well-known singer, Gita. Our eyes exchanged exhilirating signals We lost our hearts, in conversation A wonderful bird came flying from lands unknown He sat on my terrace and trilled this world is a fete of love He spoke so sweetly, his words pierced my heart Our eyes exchanged exhilirating signals We lost our hearts, in conversation All that seems strange, initially... turn gradually into encounters of love Hearts beat when our eyes meet; what an amazing game is this? Our eyes exchanged exhilirating signals We lost our hearts, in conversation If today, it's but a trifling matter... Tomorrow, it will be the talk of the town Where the flame smolders, the moth will follow And two strangers will unexpectedly become lovers Our eyes exchanged exhilirating signals We lost our hearts, in conversation - What a sweet voice. - Sounds like a cuckoo singing. This is the first time I've heard her sing. - She has outshone the best singers. - There's no doubt about that! Truly, singing is magic. The sort of magic that transports a person elsewhere. I wish I could keep listening to her sing. - I'll definitely meet her. - Yes, you should. Honoring an artiste is the real appreciation of their art. - Okay, Rai Saheb. I beg your leave. - Leaving so soon, dear boy? Alright. Let me see you to the car. The driver will drop you home. - Driver! - Yes, sir? Drop the gentleman home. - Namaste. - Bless you, my son. - What are you thinking of, daddy? - What any father with a daughter... thinks of all the time, my dear. Thank God this thought has finally come to you. I've a young man in mind... he earns Rs.10,000. He has no vices whatsoever. He is wedded to spirituality. Namaste, aunty. Namaste, Rai Saheb. - Namaste, Miss Usha. - Where are you coming from, dear? I'd gone to the orphanage. There are 350 children there, poor souls. I give them 2 pairs of clothes and a pair of shoes each every year. Well done! What novel is this? - It's the Bhagavad Gita. - Oh? I didn't get the time to read it in the morning. Do you have incense, aunty? Of course. Go to my room. Forgive me, but one should never owe God anything. This is his favorite hobby. Now he'll grieve the whole day... - since he returned from the orphanage. - Hasn't he ever gone to a mental asylum? - What do you mean? I mean, if he went there, he should never return. I've heard it said that serving the mentally ill will wash off all your sins. Honestly, we aren't here to see the girl. We've come to show you the boy. Speak softly, sir. She thinks that I'm the one getting engaged. If she overhears this, she won't come before you. - You are very smart, young man! - That I am. - Please come in. - Namaste, sir. - Namaste, my dear sir, namaste. You've obliged us by coming here. Please take a seat. You're embarrassing me, sir. Sit down, do. - You sit down too. - I'll be right back. Wonderful! - Very nice indeed! - Don't you think I'm beautiful? 100%. They'll be very impressed. Quick, bring the tea. They have already arrived. Brother, bring the sweets. - Did you see her? How's my sister-in-law? - Very nice. Go see for yourself. - Yes, of course. - That had to happen. - Of course. - Yes, yes. I would like to greet all of you. - And on behalf of all of us... - A greeting for me? Come, my sister. Sit beside me. Why not? Who else will I sit beside except you? - This is Gita, my precious daughter. - May you live long. And this is my precious brother, Mohan. And this is our charming Harish. - Now tell me your name. - Excuse me? - They call me Mala [necklace]. - You're truly like a pearl necklace. You will light up the world of anyone who is lucky enough to get you. And your name is Gita. The man who reads you will be blessed. Look, they've already begun teasing each other. The relationship between sisters-in-law is such. It's a joyous union, Lalaji. The tea is getting cold amidst this conversation. - Oh, I forgot all about it. - Shall I make it? I'll drink the tea you prepare, the day... - I come with the wedding procession.\n-On that day, I'll feed you sweets. You'll feed me sweets? It's my brother, Harish, who will eat them. And what will you feed my brother, Mohan? Whatever is left-over. Brother, I like her. Shall I say 'yes' on your behalf? Do you want your marriage arranged for next month? Or next year? Why delay auspicious moments? Let's have a quick engagement and wedding. You won't say anything? That means you agree. - Father... - Yes? Yes? I've got the daughter-in-law I've desired. Dear sir, I accept this proposal. You've honored us, Lalaji. A huge burden has been lifted. Mala, complete the first ritual of the engagement ceremony, my dear. Give me your hand, my sister-in-law. Sister-in-law? Brother Harish! You have a lovely daughter, my dear sir. But she's your daughter from today onwards, Lalaji. - Please have a sweet. - Please take one, too. Here, son. A mother might forget to nurse her baby. But this man never forgets to be on time. The clock chimes 9.30 and the cashier steps in. Namaste, sir. What's happening? - Er... that... - Namaste, sir. The manager is asking for you. - Hmm? - The manager is asking for you. - What are my orders, Manager saab? - Mr. Radhe Mohan... - You have to go to Bombay. - Bombay? Yes. It's a quite a large sum of money... and the party wants to be paid in cash. I can't trust anyone except you. Go by the Frontier Mail tomorrow. Your seat has been booked - As you wish. - And here's the draft for Rs.95,000. There are 5 partners in the company Take separate receipts from each. Very well. Excuse me, where does Miss Gita live? - Geeta, who? - The Geeta who sings on the radio? - On the radio...? - Yes. She sings very well. Excuse me, I don't live here. - Please ask someone else. - Very well. Gita! Gita! - Hey, she's come! She's come... - Who has come? - Frontier Mail! - Frontier Mail? The one you keep pestering me about. - Ah-ha! So that 'someone' has finally come here. She heard you sing on the radio... and impressed by your song, is coming to meet you. But, listen... she shouldn't find out that we are siblings. Understand? - Why? - Only then will it be fun! Don't worry. I'll act so well that the guest will be impressed. She had an accident with you the other day, now she'll have one with me. Be careful. Don't give the game away. I'm the sister of a soon-to-be-lawyer. How dare I mess up? - Hmm? - Come on, move aside. - Namaste, Miss. - Namaste. - Are you Gita? - Yes. - What's it? - My name is Usha. I heard you on the radio and came to meet you. Please come in. Did you like the song so much? Yes, I'd love to sit and listen to you all day. A cuckoo has a sweet voice but is not beautiful... But God has blessed you with both beauty and talent. God wasn't miserly with your beauty either. You are beauty personified. Your speech is also lyrical. And why not? Music and poetry go hand-in-hand, after all. Please take a seat. I'll get some tea. - Please don't take the trouble. - It's no trouble at all. Sit down, do. - Y..you?! - It happened just as I feared. - I mean, another accident? - Why are you here? And I want to know why you're here. - This is my.. - This, too, is your house? - Oh, it's not mine. It belongs to someone else. Oh. So, this time, we meet by accident in a stranger's house... An accident here, an accident there... - an accident at this turn... - Keep quiet! - Alright. How did you get this photograph? What does it matter where I got it from? Aren't they a lovely couple? Usha, you can't hide your beauty behind a muslin veil. Truth be told... my brother hasn't looked so handsome in a photo before. - Brother? - Yes. - He's your brother? - Uh-huh. So you two siblings have been making fun of me! Why shouldn't I make fun of you? I thought... my brother's choice would turn out to be fake. But she turned out to be pure gold. Now I'll get myself some tea with 5tsps of sugar, okay? Tell me, when did I get this photo taken? This... accident happened by coincidence? - But such coincidences don't occur all the time, Miss Usha. - Excuse me? I'm taking this photo with me. - What will you do with it? - What will I do? - That I don't quite know myself. - But I do. - What do you know? - Only that you will face it and say... "Keep quiet!" "Shut up!" "Mannerless fool!" "Nonsense!" "Idiot!" These titles are only for you... not for the photograph. - Thanks. - Gita! Oh, that's father. Gita! - What is it? - Father is home! What will you tell father about her? I'll place my hand on my heart and lower my gaze... - he'll understand. - Gita! - Namaste, sir. - Namaste, my dear. Who are you? She's my sis-... she's my friend, Bhagirathi, father. Oh, alright. May you live long. Gita, my dear, pack my bag. I have to prepare to leave. - Where are you going, father? - I'm leaving for Bombay by the Mail tomorrow. I've to make a large cash payment to a client. - Okay, Gita, I must leave. - You will come again, won't you? - Of course. Look, my beloved's love dances in my eyes Like a gentle drizzle or the notes of a sitar Like Spring, gently approaching gardens Look, my beloved's love dances in my eyes Who is it who spoke such sweet words of love? Swaying, swaggering, comes a night of love A heart spoke A heart listened And quietly, silently, they acquiesced Look, my beloved's love dances in my eyes Like a gentle drizzle or the notes of a sitar Like Spring, gently approaching the gardens O stars and moon, what do you know of love? Go away, don't ask me the name of my beloved Dear wind, please go away too, don't ask me his abode This is the first Spring approaching my garden Look, my beloved's love is dancing in my eyes Like a gentle drizzle or the notes of a sitar Like Spring, gently approaching the gardens Look, my beloved's love is dancing in my eyes Bravo! Today, my Usha is drowning in a sea of melody. - What is the matter, my dear? - Uh... I... I met him today. - Who? - That girl, whose song we heard on the radio that day? - Oh, yes, yes, yes. - You liked her singing too, didn't you? Of course! She had such a melodious voice. It isn't just her voice; her looks and behavior are also pleasing. My Usha is no less melodious than a cuckoo. They must have been happy to meet you. Yes. They were very hospitable indeed. 'They' were? So was someone else there? Yes, daddy. He came there, too. - He... - He? - He? Who? - Oh, the one... to whom you kept saying, 'Excellent!' 'Excellent!' Bravo! So Harish was also present there? Yes, Miss Gita is his sister. Excellent! So they are siblings? They are so good together, daddy. - And the cashier... - Oh, so he was also there? He wasn't there. He came later. He was in a hurry. - He had to go to Bombay. - Excellent! Bombay is the best city in India. I would've gone with him to visit too, but your mother... Daddy, he's not going on a holiday. - He has to make a large cash payment to a client. - Cash payment? - Excellent! So that's the reason! - Yes, daddy. Harish, my son, cable me as soon as your results are out. - I'll send you the address of my hotel. - Okay, father. Don't forget to get my bangles, father. And you don't forget to light the lamp to the holy basil. I'm sorry! I thought I was alone in this compartment. Forgive me. Did I mistakenly enter the ladies' compartment? Not at all. In fact, I always travel in the men's compartment. Look, when the ladies' compartment is full, it's filled with their chatter... and when it's empty, there's the danger of thieves. But here, there's neither. Er... may I sit here? Of course. Please sit down. Thank you. I'm weird. We met and talked... and I didn't even ask your name. I am called Radhe Mohan. I am simply Roma. - Are you travelling alone? - I'm all alone at present. For what it's worth, I'm married. My husband had gone to Europe. He's reaching Bombay this week. I'm going to meet him. - Chocolate? - That's for kids. My husband loves to eat it. - He is young, right? - Excuse me? - He must be a couple of years older to you. - Oh... So your husband is elderly? - Do you smoke? - No. - Drink? - No. Very good! My husband smokes and drinks. No wonder he has bouts of cough in the morning... and his fingers tremble throughout the day. Just shake hands with me. Please! Ooh, mummy! What a grip! This grip! This is what's called a man's grip! I think we're reaching a station. - Where do you think you're going? - Madam, I'm called Mirza Rusva. May I sit beside you if you don't mind? - Beside me? - Yes. - Do sit down. - Thank you very much, sir. - There are too many flies here. - Madam, you are right. This place is called Sugarville. Sugar and flies are the main products here. May I present some perfume for your amusement? That's my business in Bombay. I'm going there now. - Bombay? - Yes. - This seems to be your first trip to Bombay. - Yes. - Will you be staying long? - Just a couple of days. A couple of days at least. By then, my husband will also return. There are good hotels here? All that glitters is not gold. But we always stay in a small hotel. Neat and clean. Fresh air, fresh views... - They wash the vegetables in potassium permanganate before cooking. - Oh. - They get their ghee from Punjab. - I see... But passing trains do bother the patrons a little. - The railway tracks run close, that's why. - What's the name of the hotel? - Aaraam (Rest). - Aaraam. Wonderful! What can I say about Bombay? A man comes here in excellent form... and in four days, is turned into a lizard. Here's Bombay! Namaste, Ma'am. You should have cabled us. Nandu would have picked you up. I'm familiar with the streets of Bombay. Ah, yes, he's new to the city. - Make sure he's comfortable. - Nandu! - Yes, sir. - Take his luggage to Room No. 10. - Okay. - And open Room No. 9 for Madam.\n-Okay. - Ghotu! - Yes, sir! - Go, go! Er..., please go ahead. Let me make a few calls. Well, my magician! - Good morning, boss! - How far have you reached? I have him eating from my hands. Roma can entrap even the angels, boss! These are mere mortals. The moment you appear before me and show me a glimpse of your face You do realize you rouse the passions within my breast When you hold my hand And express your love for me You assuage an ache and fan the flames of another My heart's restless when you're far away from me and the beats quicken when you come near The flames may be invisible but they smolder in my heart Why do you come for few moments just to douse the flame? You assuage an ache and fan the flames of another The moment you appear before me and show me a glimpse of your face You do realize you rouse the passions within my breast This love has made my heart crazed with passion for so long The world is the same, but it's made me a stranger to myself With the exception of yourself you forget everything in the world You assuage an ache and fan the flames of another The moment you appear before me and show me a glimpse of your face You do realize you rouse the passions within my breast For how long will we separate only to meet again? And meet only to separate again? The words that you said to me Are just what I wanted to say The few moments that you meet me and sweep me off my feet You assuage an ache And fan the flames of another This is the limit, aunty! This is the limit. I can't take it anymore! - What happened? - I've decided I'll never come here again. I won't look, won't feel jealous. I won't pine away either. - But what's wrong? - Let me tell you, aunty... this lipstick will ruin you one day. Go see what your step-daughter and the cashier's son are doing in the garden. - What are they doing? - Conspiring to pension you off. Playing at love to sow the seeds of your destruction. I say, say something. - Say what? - That your nephew is always right. You lit the fire. I put it off. Silly girl! Can a puff douse the fires in our hearts? - Then how are they doused? - By love's gentle breezes. - Usha? - Hmm? When you're in front of me... I feel like this world is heaven on earth. I pray that the heavens will continue to smile on us. And that we're free to sing the songs of love. - What's wrong, Usha? - Nothing. I fear, sometimes... that someone may set our world ablaze. Don't say that, Usha. Hey, Rai Saheb, listen to me, whatever happened to your brains? Listen! Stop right there! You always arrive like an earthquake! What's the matter? Take a look at what's happening in the garden. That cashier's son is destroying your honor. Will you throw him out or should I ask the servants to kick him out? Your only grouse is that he's the cashier's son. isn't that so? - So? Are they our equals? - They are much better than us. We don't have the reputation that the cashier has in this city. These are not your words, but that of your darling Usha. Compare him to my Loku, and he'll seem like a man who polishes boots. But Usha has to like him too. Were Loku not my nephew, your darling Usha would have been all over him. Excuse me... may I come in? Oh... do come in, please come in. Oh... so you're going sightseeing? No, no, I'm going to the bank. I'll encash a draft so I can pay the clients. You're going to the bank? If you don't mind... may I come with you? This is Bombay. You need more than one pair of eyes here. Last year, my sister was robbed of Rs.20,000 here. Very well. Though I'm in the habit of being alert. You have no idea how unsafe this place is. Okay, then let's go. - It must be a nuisance to you. - Not at all. You're my guest, Mr. Cashier. - Come, let's go. - Yes, let's. Come on! Ask the cashier to get Rs.95,000 in 100 rupee notes. Manager saab... - may I use your telephone? - Of course. Here. - Thank you. - Bell, Moon, Stars & Company... - Here, let me help. Bell, Moon & Stars Company... - Hello? Hotel Aaraam. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Three hellos! That means, it's for the boss. Bell Moon & Stars Company? Speak here please. Here you go. Hello? This is cashier Radhe Mohan speaking. Yes. I'll be there in half an hour. - Please call your lawyer. - Can you come in the evening? Our lawyer has gone to Pune. Where are you staying? Hotel Aaraam? Room number 10? Alright. Look... we'll be there at 9.30 p.m. sharp. - Of course. Of course. - Alright, then. Here. The cashier killed Roma and then killed himself. One dead body in the room, the other on the rail tracks! The cashier from Northern India Bank kills Roma and himself. One dead body in the room, the other on the rail tracks! Get today's newspaper! You are now dead! Dead to the world! - No, no, I'm alive! - Notoriety is worse than death. And death is better than a life of infamy. - But... my kids... - Forget them. Stifle your feelings of affection. Now you're not cashier Radhe Mohan... but a burden on this earth and a blot on society. The shadow of your disgrace will ruin their lives. Today, you have neither home nor family... Forget them! Forget them! - Oh, Usha, my darling! - What's the matter, daddy? - Look at this, my dear... See what's in the paper... Harish, son of cashier, Radhe Mohan... has broken all past records in his law exams. He's come first! My dear, find out at once when the cashier is returning from Bombay. The front page has news of the son... and the next page has news of the father. When is he coming? Turn the page. You will find out. Two murders in Bombay. The price of an old man's love is Rs.95,000. And two lives. It is said that Radhe Mohan, the cashier of Northern India Bank... murdered a young woman named Roma and then killed himself. The beauty lies dead in Hotel Aaraam... while her lover's corpse lies on the railway tracks. I don't care what the world says, I refuse to believe this, brother. Father can't do something like this. The news is false, I tell you! - Absolutely false! - I pray that it is so, Gita. - Are you cashier Radhe Mohan's... - Yes, I'm his daughter. And I'm his son, lnspector. Tell me, what's it you want? - We've come to search your house. - Search? You know this concerns a theft of Rs.95,000... - and murder. - Brother! They have to fulfil their duty, Gita. Alright, lnspector. Please search our home. What's going on, brother? We've lost our father... our honor has bitten the dust... and today... today, the police have come home. Gita, my sister, don't cry, my dear. Perhaps God is testing us. The good times didn't last... neither will the bad times. - Neither will the bad. - Excuse me... The search didn't turn up anything, but if need be, we may trouble you again. - Is the master home? - Yes. - Let him in. - Namaste, sir. - I live in a decent locality, Mr. Lawyer. And you came here so openly? Didn't you think people might be watching? I... I don't quite understand your meaning. I mean, please leave here at once. Since they saw you come in, they should see you leave as well. I'll explain the rest to them. - I came to fix the wedding date... - Your father fixed that well, didn't he? The entire neighborhood came to congratulate us. - So... are you reneging on your promise? - I gave my word to a gentleman. Not to a thief or murderer! - For God's sake, sir... - For god's sake, I can donate to an orphanage. I can get a temple's broken walls repaired. But I cannot tolerate within my home, even the shadow of such a girl... who brings with her a disgraced family honor. Don't say that, sir... For respectable people, engagements are not child's play... that you can fix and break at will. You have a young, unmarried daughter too. This is my house, not a court of law, Mr. Lawyer. If you want to argue, do it outside. Please leave. - I beg of you... - No, I beg you... for God's sake, go away. - But what will I tell Gita? - Think of a reason on your way. You are a lawyer. You'll surely think of something. Please go. Ramu! I'd have refused if they had agreed. As if I would go away leaving my brother alone. First, bring your bride home. Then she can hold one of my hands while you hold the other. And you can both push me out of the house. Then I'll leave. Gita, what are you saying? My darling sister, I live only for you. Have you heard the cashier's story? You said he was second only to God. Time is all-powerful, my dear. Discuss the matter with Loku and fix a date for the engagement. But Loku has to agree too. He's not a nobody... to marry a girl who has disgraced herself. Has he even come here since the news was published? Why don't you go to his house? He will never refuse you. Their love story is the talk of the town. If you'd only listened to me earlier, Loku would've been indebted to me. Now I'll be obliged to him. What can I do other than place our family honor at his feet? So I'll do that too. The doctor said to inform him immediately if the fever rises. I'll soon be back, Gita. Don't get up. Just a minute... Here... and pray to God... that my sister's grief passes. You didn't even light the lamp at the holy basil. It's the sole reminder of our mother... and father's command... She's burning with fever. Father... you joined mother. You left us both behind. Hold my hand.. Hold my hand, father... I want to come to you. No, my dear. This is that hell where a man cannot acknowledge his own. He can see everything but cannot do a thing. Dear God, how much more will you test me? Brother... Brother... Shameless dog! Stealing from the home which gave you food! Have you no shame? I gave you a place to sit and you're stealing from my home! Wretch! Cheat! I pity your age, or I'd hand you over to the cops. Get lost from here. Don't let me see you again. Never be seen here again or I'll have you imprisoned! Did you see that? Stifle your feelings, and go away from here. Or your son will send you to jail! No, no... He can't be blamed. I am the culprit. I tried to hide the truth. I feared death. I forgot the power of time, society and coincidence. But now I'll tell the world I am innocent! Guiltless! I did nothing wrong. What can they do to me? They can only hang me. Right? Let them send me to the gallows... strangle me. I am already dead. A corpse. A walking corpse. Please be seated, Panditji. Listen carefully, aunty... I will only accept the proposal when you agree to my conditions. - Don't argue with your elders. - I'm not being argumentative, aunty... It's a matter of principles. I hate dowry as much as the Japanese hate atom bombs. Bravo! Those who don't even have fire crackers... should definitely hate atom bombs. If I had my way, I'd stamp out this practice. Don't think them false, Rai Bahadur, sir. My principles aren't only for display. Of course, one to display and one to live by. But where are we offering dowry? Can't we give our daughter gifts? God has been kind to me, aunty. What will you give her as a gift, after all? - Rs.50,000 or Rs.100,000? - We've ordered a car worth Rs.30,000. A diamond set worth Rs.80,000 is getting ready. That's all? Must I break my principles for this? He's not making you his son-in-law, is he? He's making you his son. All that's his is yours. Bravo! This is what outdoing one another looks like! - What did you say? - Nothing. Aunt and nephew are clashing over principles. - Now answer your aunt. - What can I say? I'm in a quandry. I know that breaking your principles is a bad thing. But disobeying your elders is also a sin. Panditji, you may begin to earn your pay. Why delay an auspicious moment? May the eternal mother always look upon us with favor And protect us, along with Lord Ganesha Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - Give it, my dear. - Namaste. - Namaste. - Bravo! - Namaste. - Bless you, my son. - You do have a horoscope, don't you? - Why? I'll have to match your horoscope with the girl's, young man. Lest they clash. - And if they do? - Nothing. - Before the wedding, the groom will... - What did you say? What I mean is there will be obstacles to the marriage. Something or the other crops up unexpectedly. Oh, yes, of course. Come to my bungalow... You can match horoscopes and everything else over there. Where is your bungalow located? Opposite the Northern India Bank. You can't miss it. Shanti Kutir. (Peace Haven) My dear... This photo has been cut out of your life, my dear. If your mother sees it, she'll get angry. Father! You can't challenge the Fates. Perhaps the Gods weren't pleased with our happiness. Hey, where are you going? Old man, you have lived your life. Why are you bent on getting me into trouble? If you want to die so badly, drown yourself in River Yamuna. The elders say that women are the root of all problems. That's why I offer flowers with due deference at Dhiru's advice. So the money you are to get as dowry... has to be properly documented. - It will be done. - Not 'it will be done'... It has to be done right away. Dhiru, go freshen up. We'll finish it all right now. Come on. Mr. Dhiru, doubts arose in your mind... and you boarded a flight from Bombay to come here. - Isn't that so? - It's absolutely true. - I absolutely had doubts. - Hmm... Therefore, we have decided... that you will be in charge of distributing the money. - What do you say, Mr. Loku? - Yes, of course; here's Rs.95,000... divide it into three parts. Mathur! Who's it? - Who are you? - Speak! Who are you? Hmm... He came to steal the watch! Thief! Crook! No, no, I'm not a thief. I didn't steal anything. - This watch... this watch... - This watch belongs to your father, right? - Tell us who you are! - I'll tell you who he is... He's a murderer, a killer. He killed Dhiru! Didn't you hear the sound of the pistol? No, no, I'm not a murderer. I'm not a killer. I... I... The court will decide that. Call the police. If father were here today... how happy he would have been to see you in these robes. His affectionate gaze would have shielded you from all harm... and he would have quietly followed you to court. And when you cross-examine the accused at the dock... he wouldn't take his eyes off you. And he would silently bless you. "Go! May victory be yours!" Milord, the accused in the dock... is a professional thief. We've met before. In my own home. The crook wanted to steal a silver frame. I took pity on his advanced age and let him go. Had I handed him to the cops then... the young man who fell victim to his gun, would have been saved. If only we could place the trembling heart of the victim's mother in his breast. If only the tears of the victim's sister could drench his shameless eyes! So this hard-hearted man could feel his helplessness. Milord, he is a sore on the face of humanity. The enemy of the law, a burden upon this earth. A man who feels no pain, nor sheds no tears. Milord, these are men who are obstacles on the path of our progress. Let the real case begin. My Lord, the first witness... Mr. Loknath... the house belongs to him. The deceased, Dhirumal Saindas... was employed by his friend, the second witness, Mr. Mathur. He had flown down from Bombay just that evening. Both witnesses heard a gunshot... and ran to the hall, where they saw the deceased's body. They apprehended the fleeing culprit... and informed the local police. Therefore, under Section 302 of the Indian Penal code... I hold the accused, Ram Gopal, responsible for killing Dhirumal Saindas. And under Section 105 of the Indian Penal Code... I also charge him with theft because the deceased's golden watch... was in his hands then. My Lord, this is the watch... that the accused wanted to steal. Sorry, milord. I was swept away by emotion upon seeing this watch. My Lord... the murderer, who's standing in the dock... could, by selling this watch, have smoked opium for four days. Smoked hashish, or even drunk himself senseless. But, milord, this watch is a symbol of my family's honor. It's proof of my deceased father's integrity. This watch was presented to my late father as a reward. But he had taken this to Bombay. Then how did it get here? What's its connection to the deceased? Who was he? My Lord, I would like to ask for a remand of 15 days to investigate. Remand granted. Till the 16th. Hey, Loku! What happened at court? What can happen? The prosecutor has asked for a remand. God save us from these legal minds. They're great at splitting hairs. As they sow, so shall they reap. But our friend, Loknath, gets strange ideas. The killer did his job, the victim died... And he's the one worried. And why? Due to the city's fear. He's already sent five money orders of Rs.500 each to the victim's mother. Bravo! It's due to compassionate men like him... that the heavens are still standing. Yet, he still can't sleep at night. He's forever worrying about the fate of the deceased's family. I think he should be married off as quickly as possible. So he stops worrying about the world. And looks after his family instead. So what's the problem? Let's call the priest at once. If their horoscopes clash... we can conduct a puja. Isn't that right, dear? Right. Congratulations, Mr. Loknath. - You're back, brother? - Gita, I'm going to Bombay today. Bombay? My heartbeats quicken when I hear that city's name. Why're you going to Bombay, brother? I learned in court... that the killer had the same watch the bank gave father. - How did that watch get here? - That's what I intend to find out. Who are you? Whom do you work for? Panditji, the auspicious time is passing. Are you Mr. Loknath? Yes, indeed. That's my name. Please come in, and be seated. - I need to talk to you for a minute - In private? - Yes. - Excuse me, this is a private matter. May I listen to him? - What's the matter, lnspector? - There's a summons in your name. - A... a summons in my name? - Yes, of course. - Tell us the date. - I'll come with Mathur. Of course Mathur will come along. He's my partner, my brother. - Mathur? - Let's go. Mr. Loknath! Do you recognize this watch? Er.. yes. This watch was in the pocket of the deceased. So the deceased brought it from Bombay? Sir, I don't know if he brought it from Bombay or Agra. But he had it. Mr. Mathur, can you tell me where the deceased got this watch? No. - Do you recognize this bag? - Of course. - And you, Mr. Loknath? - Of course. This bag belongs to my friend, Mr. Mathur. - Did it contain notes worth Rs.95000? - Money? - It didn't have any money... - Then what did it have? It... it had shaving implements. Milord, it had shaving cream, otion, comb, mirror... blade... What do you say, Mr. Mathur? Mr. Mathur, did you know the late cashier, Radhe Mohan? - No.. - Are you the owner of Hotel Aaraam? - Yes. - Did cashier Radhe Mohan stay in room no: 10? Perhaps. It's a hotel. People come and go. So this bag and the watch belong to him? The bag is mine. I don't know who the watch belongs to. - Mr. Loknath? - Yes. - Why did the late Dhirumal Saindas come here? Er... er... To wish me upon my engagement. - He could have congratulated you through a 12-anna telegram. - Milord! - This is a personal matter and it's irrelevant to this case. - Mr. Loknath! Just answer my questions! - Mr. Gold Medallist, say something! - When the time is right. My Lord, with the help of the Bombay police, I've brought the man... who attempted to kill me there. His testimony will, to a great extent, prove... who's the real killer. Call Nandlal, alias Nandu. Nandlal, alias Nandu! Nandlal, alias Nandu! Nandlal, alias Nandu, with God as your witness... swear that you will speak only the truth. With God as my witness, I swear... that I'll speak only the truth. Do either of you recognize him? - No! - Absolutely not! - Do you recognize them? - I'm no traitor, sir... to not recognize my masters. - Who are your employers? - Sir... Mr. Loknath and Mr. Mathur, both. Hmm... do you also know the deceased, Dhirumal Saindas? Huh? Dhiru? Yes, he was my partner. Did you attack me in Bombay? - Yes, sir. - Why did you attack me? Was there any enimity between us? I have to face God, sir... I'm also fed up of this difficult life. But Mr. Mathur is a very stern man. It seems, milord, that the prosecutor has imported an actor from Bombay. Right! My lord, the murder took place in Delhi. The man was in Bombay then. That means that his evidence is just a waste of the court's time. My lord! This man has been working for them for six years. He is the late Dhirumal Saindas's partner. He attacked me in Bombay upon their orders. Dhirumal Saindas's real killer remains hidden. This is absolutely false, my lord. But my lord, before he begins questioning this lying, unreliable witness... I'd like to bring something to the court's notice. The prosecutor will try anything to let the auspicious moment pass. Because, my lord, I'm marrying the girl the prosecutor loves. Please continue. - Did you see cashier Radhe Mohan? - Of course, sir. - When Roma brought him in. - Why did you notice him particularly? When the cashier left Delhi... there was a telephone call from Mr. Loknath. That's utter nonsense, your honor, absolute nonsense. I answered the call, sir. Mr Loknath said, "Tell Mr. Mathur... 'The goods have left by the Frontier Mail.'" I thought they might be crates of liquor... that he frequently sends from Delhi. Lies! Nonsense! He's rambling. Yes, Nandu. What happened then? The nest day, Roma reached the hotel with a simple old man in tow. - Roma, who? - She was a crook, sir. She did all these important tasks. - Do you recognize this bag? - Very well, sir. It was in the cashier's hand. God bless my Loku! His reach is so influential. - Of course! What reach! - Please ask when he'll be back. Hello? May I ask when he'll be back? I heard he's been arrested for murder. The magistrate has begun to suspect him. - Excellent! - What did he say? - He says the magistrate is coming. - This relationship will increase our prestige! He's your nephew, after all. Whenever he comes, he has something important to say. - But where are you going? - To ensure he's not waiting for the collector. - I'll get the wedding procession energized. - Okay. Bangles... Father... And due to this, sirs, the next morning's newpapers... carried the news that the cashier had stolen Rs.95,000. And my lord, this infamy ended my sister's engagement. And my relation with Usha... They got her engaged to witness no: 1. And the cashier, milord... who was sent on this job due to his integrity... was branded a knave. Initially, there were five claimants to the cash... Mr. Loku, Mr. Mathur, Dhiru, Jaggu and Roma. Now there are only three left. The day Dhiru boarded the plane for Delhi.. I tried stopping him but he was consumed by the thought of Rs.32,000. Finally, like Roma and Jaggu, he too was killed. - How did Jaggu die? - In a train accident. The body found on the tracks was not the cashier's. It was Jaggu's. He was wearing the cashier's coat. Nandu! Does that mean the cashier is alive? Did you... did you ever see him again? Where is he?? - Where is he, Nandu? - I'll tell you where the cashier is. With dishonor staining his forehead... and infamy, a millstone around his neck... hiding from every gaze... he prayed to God for deliverance. But, suddenly... he heard the newspaper vendors He was reassured to hear... he was crushed to death by a train. He was dead. Time passed by... The world had forgotten him and he had consigned the world to oblivion. But paternal love is is a bad influence, my lord. The love for his children made him so restless... - he returned home. - Accused Ram Gopal... - How do you know all this? - Slowly... - all will be revealed, Mr. Prosecutor. - Speak, prisoner at bar. - What happened next? - My lord... Stolen loot can never be hidden. It will always reveal itself. This man standing opposite me... with the cashier's bag in his hand... got down from a cab and entered Shanti Kutir. That bag... that 95,000 rupees... If the cashier could get it... then the stain on his honor would be wiped off. My lord, the late Dhirumal entered that very bungalow. That watch in his pocket... was the same one that the bank had given the cashier. The watch, the bag... the money... these three could turn the tables for him. It could give him back his life. Taking advantage of the darkness... he entered the bungalow too. He couldn't find the bag anyhere but Dhirumal's coat was hanging before him. It had the watch. As soon as he took the watch, he heard a gunshot from the hall. He was terrified... and tried to flee. But... these men framed him for murder and handed him to the police. Father... So you are Radhe Mohan, the cashier? Yes, my lord. I am that unfortunate man who, overcome by affection... went home that night. I was thrown out like a thief. Brought before my own son... as a suspected murderer. But why did you give a false name? Because... I had no proof. The world had forgotten me. I didn't want to defame my children again. I acquit the cashier with honor. And witnesses 1 and 2... I hold you responsible for the murder of the deceased, Dhirumal Saindas... under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. And order your arrest. Who left these bangles in my box? Father is definitely alive! I saw him in a dream. - Gita! - Father! - Father! - Congratulations, sir, congratulations! Congratulations, Harish. Mr. Cashier, crime can never be hidden. In much the same way, truth can never remain hidden. Gita, my dear, I congratulate you too, upon finding your father. And I'll congratulate you again in the evening when you get a sister-in-law. - Sister-in-law? - Sister-in-law. Brother..father.. Father! The wedding procession is here, Usha, dear. So many famous people! - The wedding procession is here? - Yes, go look! [Priest chanting prayers.] Hold the girl's hand. - [Priest continuing to chant.] - Excellent! Loku, my dear, see, your wish has also been fulfilled... and so has the desire of lchhapooran [Goddess who grants desires] Devi. Sit down, my dear, sit down, sit down... What a lovely pair! Hey, why are you feeling shy now? Harish! Hey, bless them before you leave. Harish... Usha!
