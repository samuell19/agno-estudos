- Wild, savage, and unstoppable. The north's Berserker warriors are almost more beast than man. They feel no pain or fear like animals. They can enter a rageful trance. While in this trance, they believe themselves to be unstoppable. They're described to be almost possessed while in this state. In the land of the Vikings on the Shetland Isles, two battles have been fought for many years between the Berserkers and Vikings. The Berserkers are led by their leader Snorre whose throne is succeeded by his sons Steiner who has fought many battles and youngest Rolf who has yet to fight. - I will use your bones to pick at my teeth. - A game has be granted by the Berserkers. That, if the Vikings are able to fight to the death, but survive their match, they are to walk free and be free. No Viking has lived to prove this promise correct until now. - Father. - Ah, Olav, put down your sword and come to thy death. - I have no fear in my bones, no fury for you, Snorre. I want peace and I wish for you to leave. I wish for no battle. - No fury? Well, that is something you must find in your bones, if you wish to survive, brother. - My men will take your children and what's left of your family. I shall be the one to command them, to fight my people. All will have a fair chance and no game. - Get off our land, vulture. - Oh, what a beauty you have. I should take this beauty and consider it for myself. - Do not touch my wife. - Easy, Olav. You wish to at least make it to the battlegrounds. Now tell me, where are your daughters? Put that sword down. Or what is it that you will do with this? You have a sword, I have my bare hands. Ah, I shall still win. - Father. - Hey. - Don't worry, boy, we shall have our fun with this one, and when we find the daughters we will have even more fun. - Oh fattah. - Won't we men? Now, tell me, where are your daughters? - I will never answer you. - I think there are ways to make you answer me. Men, women, we are to have our fun. Let the battle begin! - Stop! - Go on. - Gunner! - Stop! - Steiner, my son, you have failed me. - Father. - But you will be avenged. Save him for me. I shall take his life. I shall make your family die first, build the range inside you, then I will kill you with my bare hands! - Brother, we must find food. - We should keep marching forward. - Sister, come. - Brother, sister, I'm scared. Scared for our lives. I do not have the strength inside my heart to go on. They has taken everything from us, our homes, our families, our parents. It's all gone. - We have each other and we have family. We'll find hope and that will bring us a positive future. - All is but lost. We do have the strength to live in happiness again. - I don't see how, brother. Sister, I don't see how. - We will stop for a while, find food, rest up, then we'll find the energy to continue, come. - Listen, everything has changed. Steiner is slain, now they have escaped. If they got to the west, we have them. We have control, we will have our vengeance. - Berserkers, Snorre has an announcement, stand forth. - A man has fallen today, only one. You have taken their family, and spilt the blood of many. - Steiner was our brother, and shall be missed. - Brothers do not lose any battle. He was a false brother, Ivar. - Steiner was no brother to you. - The brother was weak, frail to lose a battle such as this. - I am not to give praise to your bother? He was close to you, but he was weak. - Knut, Ivar, Olav's son and daughters have escaped us. - Shall I search for them? - Find them, bring them to the fields. I wish to see them fight. Olav's boy will fight my son. To the death fields we shall go. - We found it. We're here. Sigrunn, Sigrunn. - My children. Can it be you're here? You're alive! Surely not. - This is what you see, we stand before you. - Your faces bring me so much joy. - Nothing to fear. We traveled alone. - Alone? - We had no choice but to leave our homes. - My sisters? - The Berserk, they had ruled our land now. We were the only but the last to survive. - Our mother and father, they forced us to flee. They thought it maybe a way we would survive. They advised us to hide here with you in the castle. - The castle, it's not safe. It's not safe here, I can't offer you safety. - Sigrunn. - The Berserkers they came and in their sick and twisted minds, they treated us like animals and they forced us to fight. But you must go. - Sigrunn, you must follow us! - I can't. There is nothing here left for me to fight for. - Sigrunn, you must come please. - There is no fight left in me, Ingrid. I have no fire in my fight at all. They've taken everything, they've taken my family. Now you must go. You must go now. Go. - Get down! - Go away. - Yes, mum. - Do you think our children have fled safely? - I have confidence in them. - They must have found themselves with Sigrunn. She will protect them. You can hold out safely at the castle. - Hold out at the castle safely? Do you speak of Turmrig Castle? - We do. - Why do you laugh at this? - No safety at Turmrig Castle, nay safety at all. - Your bitter tongue may say these things, but our sister she has men that can demolish your family. - Everyone at Turmrig Castle is slain. Not one of thou survived their battle in the field. I watched on and no one survived their battle. - You lie. - I do not. - Our sister and a man with spoke with yesterday, they were prepared for battle. - Indeed, they thought they were, but where dost thou think this blood on me has come from? - Why do you support this? You're not one of them. Your family must have been slain, brutally murdered, just as ours. Why does thee support this? - My family fought, my family were weak. I have a new family now, that is that of the Berserker. - He will kill you eventually. You're not blood, he owes you nothing. He will not be faithful to you. - Have a good day. Good luck on the battlefield. - I have no fear that they will be caught. - And when they are, we will have our fun. - Rolf, time. Men, leave us. - How are you, father? - Rolf, wash the blood from me. Is there love in your heart, Rolf? - Of course. - Is there love in your heart for family? - The love runs deep for my family. - So why do you not kill for me? Rolf, my son, you are yet to take a life with your hands. - That couldn't be further from the truth, Father. I have killed men with my bare hands many times. - Don't lie to me, Rolf. For when you lie to family, your tongue shall be taken from you. Understand? - Yes, Father. - I believe, you have my blood running through your veins but I do not see myself in you. No leader, no beast within you. Oh, your strength is nothing if you choose not to use it. - I will use my strength, when the time is right. - And is the time right now? - What do you mean? - To battle in the fields? - I'm not a beast. I may lose a battle in the fields. - A son of mine would have no fear of this, no thought of losing. Bring through the anger. Show me the beast. Show me! Show me. Yes, show me. Ach! Shall I make it? Will you battle in the next fight? Join me, come. - Do you think they would have survived, escaped the Berserkers? - Father wouldn't let a thing happen to our mother. - He would not let anything happen. But he is not always in control. What if they are dead? - Ingrid , we have no way of knowing. All we can do is as they asked. They gave their lives for us. They wanted us to survive this. They made us flee to survive, to have a life. - They have given everything for our lives. I want to go back for them. - No, we mustn't. No turning back, only forward. - Brother, all we know of has changed. Everything we know of is gone. It is no more. This world is anything but happy. I shan't think we will find happiness anymore. Not in this world. Even if we seek it. All we have is rage. Rage for revenge. - This one. - No! - No, no, no. No, Mother! - Leave her, leave her be. - Let me go! - Siv! Stop this, stop. Siv. - Hut. - No, please don't. - Shall I release her matter, Snorre? - Let Gunner out. - Gunner. - She's no match for Gunner. Let me fight her. - You shall fight your battle soon. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Go on! - I'm sorry, my sweet, but not today. - She has no sword. She has no way to survive. This fight is not fair. - Throw her a sword. - Oh, yeah, yeah! - Go on. - No! - There is my sweet. - Go on, take it, take it. Hide! - Yes! - Oh, now. - Say bye bye. - No! Siv! - I'll make you fight the next battle. I shall keep it easy. You'll fight the lady. - Yeah! - No. - Yes, yeah! - No. - Move, move. - Who goes there? Soon I shall be by thy side. Who goes there? Answer me! Who goes there? - Thou cannot get away so easy. - Where are your family? Which direction did they part? - Thou shall not answer such a question. - I'm hungry, brother. Shall we feast? Shall we feast? Help us. Our family. - She smells good. Feast. - No. - My dear. - No, no, no, no. - Help! Help me! Help me! - I'm not like them. I have Berserk blood but my mind is different. - Leave us be. - My father wants me to fight thee, but I will not do it. I don't want any part in this battle. - You lie. - I would do no such thing. - You is the son of a monster. Demon blood resides inside him, fury like no other. You has that blood. - I has that bad blood, but my thoughts are different. They're not the same. I will not fight. - What do you propose? - I propose that you flee this area as quick as humanly possible before the battle begins. Come. I do not wish to reside in this area any longer. - When will you let me fight? - Soon, soon you will fight. - With whom? - I have a plan for this. - Do tell. - I grow tired of Vigdis. I wish to have a new wife. - And what if I don't want to be your wife? - You will. - You have a confident soul. You should protect that soul. You can't always get what you want. - I always get what I desire. - You wish to make your wife and mistress fight to the death? - Yeah, she has a fiery soul. - I have fire in my soul. You filled my soul full of fire when you burned down my town. - I spared you. You have better energies than anyone I have ever known. - Snorre! Sir, may I enter? - What is it Siguard? - Your son. - What of him? - He's escaped, sir. - He's escaped and taken the lady. - And you saw this? - He sent me away. - And you let him go? And you? - It was not my doing. It was Siguard. - Find him. Find him and bring him here or else you shall lose your head. - I will find him. - He shall be gone too far into the woods. You shall do no such thing. - Then we shall have to play with you, Olav, until they return. - I cannot keep up with that energy. My bones run weak. I have no energy, no food within me, no water. - There is no time for stopping. We need to keep going. We need to find your children and tell them that the Berserkers are after them. - Why does you do this for us? What's in it for thee? Answer, be truthful. Why? - I do this, I do this because I am the wrong son born to Snorre. I despise him and his every action. - Why else? My daughter, Ingrid? - I have passion for her, yes. - A passion, a lust? - I see your family, your daughter, and I want that. I want that happiness, not the darkness and despair that I've known. - My daughter could never be with a person of Berserkers' blood. - Come on, we need to keep moving. - How far must we walk for safety? - As far as we can, days, weeks. We must go and not stop. - As soon as we reach the next village, we will seek safety. - For how long, until the Berserkers come? - Time will tell. - Preparing for a fight? - Why do you say that? - You paint white. Only those who enter into battle do such a thing. - No, this is uniform. - Uniform does not exist here. You are preparing for a fight. I'm sure of it. Who are you going against? - Well, we'll see, we'll see. - Your family did this. Both thy sisters gone. Your family, monsters, they did this! - I am sorry. I am sorry. My hideous family's actions do not represent mine, lady. I'm sorry for the actions of my family to yours. - You are just like them. You might stand, talk confident as though thee means well, as thou wants my family peace. You stand there and you watch while your family is murdering mine. You watch! - I will watch no longer. - What was that sound? - Nothing but an animal. - Animal. You used the correct word, animal. I am. No fear. My brother has gone to fetch your daughter. Now, what are you doing here, Rolf? - You fight a good one for someone to have never stepped into the death fields. - I watch, I learn. - Now you die. - What would my father say if he knew you were gonna kill me? - With me, his son, replaceable, human. - He would take your life. - A traitor! I better say this otherwise. Look who's in here is a traitor, protecting a woman with different blood. - I protect what I believe. - Your blood means nothing. We are the same. - We're not the same. - Goodbye, Ivar. I don't know who I am. Am I one of them? - Nothing like them. Thee was right, you are more than blood. You are a good man. - Blood, we need to protect you. - What's done is done. You must continue with your fight, with your energy. Go, save my children, warn them. - I shan't leave you. - They have no knowledge what come for them, they have no weapons. Go, please! - I'm sorry you won't see me protect them. - I'm sorry, I could not see you for a different man. You are no Berserker. Go! I wish your last memory of me shall not be of this. I prefer to die alone. Please go! - I will save them! - I trust you. Now, go and do good work by me. - Snorre. - Vigdis, oh you have been silent with me. Why, why? - I have been with my thoughts, lost in them. - What thoughts are these? - Thoughts of what is to come. Thoughts for me. - What do you worry of? - You promised me love. - Yes. - But the love that was before, does not seem to remain. - Why do you say such things? Questioning my love? - It is not for me to question, but for me to observe, what is happening to your thoughts. Your thoughts of me have changed. - How do you see this? - I can see it in front of me. - How do you see this? - You look at her with passion, like you did with thee. - Turid? - Yes, Turid. She is who you admire now. It is apparent that your love does not last. However, she will at one time, have the same conversation that I am having with thee. - I do not like to be questioned. I do not like to be questioned on my thoughts while we are sitting on my land. - This was never your land. Nothing is truly ours. We take things. We make things ours but they are everything but. - I took you. - You did. - And now you are mine. - Am I? - What do you mean by this? - Women have feelings. They have wants and needs just like men. - You compare me to man? - Your actions are everything but of a man's. - Now hide. Hide, we need to hide. - A Berserker. - They must have sent for us. - Go, go, go. We must go one by one. We have to separate and meet at the bottom of the coast. - We can't. - We have to, to escape. He shall see us the longer we hold tight here. Take this. - Take this, it will protect you. - What do I do with this? - You'll be fine. - I don't know. Don't leave me. - You'll be okay. - Astrid. Astrid. - Sister, go, go. - Go, go! - Wait, wait! Wait, come back. Enough! - Get away or I will cut of your head off and feed it to the wolves. - I mean no harm. - You are the son of Snorre. You've come to take me back. - I have come to protect thee. Nothing like that. I have come with love in my heart. I was just with your mother. She's dead. No! - And my father? - He is alive. I helped him escape from the clutches of the Berserker. He got caught on our escape. My father wanted, he wanted me to fight with your mother in the fields. - How did she die? - She was a strong, noble woman. She was killed by Ivar. - A brother of yours? - No, no brother of mine. - He runs through your blood. - Yes, but I am nothing like him. - And why should I trust you? - You just have to take my word. There is nothing else I can say. You just have to trust me. - There you are. - I don't want to fight you. - Using a lady's color before even winning the battle. - I suppose these will soon be my quarters. - Brave of you. I am a lot stronger than you may think. My heart burns with rage, burns with resentment and a passion to win. I have survived hell and here I stand and I will not lose the battle easily. - You and I are both the same, both plucked from our families, except you are older and I am younger, and I am newer and I am healthy, and I am able to have a child. - You may be these things, but with age comes a knowledge of how to win. Always win. - You are a very confident woman. - No need for confidence. I was made a Berserker and I feel no worry, no fear. I am numb to all emotions. I am an animal inside that will do everything it can to survive. And you are in my way. - Am I now? - You are. - Boo. - Looks like this is the end. Time to go back, meet your maker. - I shall never go back there. - You have no other choice. - I do have other ways. - Indeed, you may survive a battle in the death fields. - That is not my idea. - No! - Turid, time has come for you to battle. I no longer trust that woman. Vigdis! - Welcome. - Whose blood is that on your body? - Someone whose heart was the same as mine. Someone who wanted the same as me. Someone who is not strong. Thee gave me a fire inside, so deep, so strong and that fire can never be put out. - Where is she? - I cut out her heart and you will never have it. - What is wrong? - Our sister. - Our sister! No. - I'm sorry I was unable to protect thee. - No, sister, please. She's dead. - I will take thy life, tear apart your world - No, no! - as you have done to ours. - Stop, stop. - Let's talk this out with reasoning. - Please stop, please stop. - How many soldiers stand up for you? - Stop, stop please. - This is a man of the Berserker! - It does not matter. Yes, he may be that but he promises us help. - You believe these words? Ingrid! What has happened to your mind? What have you been fed for these words to fall out. - Leif, we have no choice. Our family, isn't, isn't just us now. Our father he remains there, alive. Please, the last man standing it is him and us and we are running out of time. Otherwise our parents they've given their lives for nothing. - You trust these words, you trust this man? Sister. - I do, I do not, I do not know what I believe! But I know that we must take action before it is the dark of night! Please. - I will tear you apart, if you betray us. - And I would do the same to you, but you have nothing to fear from me. - Stay there! Take her off, take her. Take her! - Go, take her off! - Put your hands there! - No! - She took a life. - Please no. Berserkers! - You want a battle? You shall have a battle. Magnus, come. - Magnus? Thou gives me no fair chance against such a beast! - You speak of the beast within you. Use that beast. If you win, you'll go free. - But he's animal. - You have a chance. And Gunner. - You give me no fair chance. - I do now. May you have a sword. - No one betrays me. - The towns in the east have all been invaded. The direction you thought was right is now completely wrong. They came to your village in the direction you're heading in. For safety and to warn people, we need to head west. They haven't gone in that direction. - Then we will go west. We'll warn them so they are prepared. - And how are we to know if they would ever really be able to defend their land, hmm? Look what happened to ours. - West, that's Turmrig Castle. There are many people there. So we go west, we warn them. - No, I'm not sure anyone is enough, not against them. They are monsters. - The Berserkers, what are they? - Some people, think that they are inhuman. They themselves believe that they are creatures, that their blood is something different, something more powerful that what we know. They are true beasts. This fury which they called Berserker gang, it occurs in the heat of battle and it's provoked by oneself. You can see the change, the transformation within them. The shivering, the chattering of the teeth, the coldness of their bodies. They would howl as wild as beasts. They would take down anyone and everyone in their sights. Those Berserkers lost all human capacity for reason and self-recognition and would rip their enemy to shreds with their bare hands. No weapon needed. - And how about you? Why aren't you a beast like them, hmm? - I don't know how to answer that. I haven't experienced that side that I see in them. I resist every temptation to become one of them. - Have you ever felt this need before? - When I become angry or heated, I feel this surge of energy inside me and I can't control it. I feel if I were to relax it would come out of me. - And how do we trust you tonight, not to become this thing, hmm? - If you want to keep me calm, there'll be no need. I will not give in to the beast. - The death fields, has anyone ever survived? - No. They promise that if you survive the death fields and you kill the Berserker, that you will live, that you will have your life. But no, no one has survived. The Berserkers you go up against, they are the worst of them all, the strongest, the most crazed. - My aunt? - She fought a strong battle, a noble woman. She put up a good fight. - And my father? What do they plan to do with him? - My father has a grudge against yours, for what reason I do not know. But he plans to create a fury in him, a fury so big that he turns into a monster. - Our father is a peaceful, caring man. He could never become what your father is. - My father is twisted. He plays with people's minds, including mine. Toys with people, manipulates them. - Why did you never leave before? Why now? - I'm no longer scared of him, no longer scared of death. If I die in my attempt, then I die. I used to be scared of death and what would happen after it. But, but but now if I were to survive in this world, I would want a world worth surviving for. - All right, we need to rest up. We have to reserve our energy for morning. Are we gonna be safe here? - A few hours will be fine to stay here. - Olav, sit. - Do you wish me to stay? - Magnus, you are free to leave. - Of course. - Why am I here? - I have a heavy heart alike to yours, a heart that is full of sadness. A heart that no one understands outside these walls. I have lost my son, I have lost my wives, I am all alone alike you. - I'm not alone. My children are free, my wife is free. My family have love in their hearts for me. And they will grow, become wiser, live the life they should live. - Such foolishness you have inside you, Olav. - I have nothing inside me but the truth. - You have hope. Hope is not the truth. Hope is a wish. Hope is a need. Hope is not a fact. I have never had this feeling within me. It is raw. It is deep. I cannot control it, this emptiness. - In just a word, a figment of one's imagination which you would believe to give you confidence and strength. It's just a word. We are alike ultimately. We are one and the same. We are human, Snorre. - I am not human. By tomorrow, these thoughts will be gone as we watch your family bleed out in front of you, as we watch your family battle to the death on the fields. Go rest, Olav. You will need it for your battle. - War is not necessary I will not fight you, never. - Then you will make it an easy battle. - I cannot rest. I am uneasy about what the future holds, what tomorrow holds, whether tomorrow will be my last day. I am not sleeping. My mind it is full of terrible thoughts. - I have those same thoughts. - I am Ingrid. You were not given my name. - I am Rolf. - My brother, sleeping, he is Leif. - Ingrid, a name of strength and beauty. - I am not so sure about that. It was my grandmother's. - Was she as beautiful as you? - Why are you doing this, other than for yourself? - Why else would I do it other than for myself? - Thank you, Rolf. You know, if you were not here I think we would be dead. I believe that to be true. - You have no need to thank me. My family have done some awful, unspeakable things to you. - But never you. Why do you talk of them? Why do you speak of them as if though you were one of them? They may be in your bones and in your blood but your mind, that is you. That is not them. - Morning. - Come on, Princess. - Come on. - Come on, sit! - Get in you. - Children, your faces. - Father! - I thought we would never meet again. - Rolf! - Don't fear. - Everything to fear. - Mother, where is she? Where is she? - She's gone, Leif. - No. - She's gone. - Rolf, for you. - Leave him with me. - You don't wish me to stay, just in case? - Leave us. - As you wish. - Father. - Do not dare use that word for me. Your tongue should not know the word and your mind should forget the meaning for you have no father on this Earth, boy. - Father. - I said do not ever use that word for me! You are no son to me. I should save my energies today. - You are to fight today, not watch? - Yes. - Who are you to fight? - I am to battle you, boy. I shall see you on the fields. Until then... - Come on. - I will enjoy watching you get torn apart on that field. - Who's to go first? - I'll put the boy in first. - And who is he against? - Gunner! - I will use your bones to pick on my teeth. - Let the battle begin. - Ah, kill him! - So I'll avenge my mother. - No! - Go! - Stop! - No! - No! - No! - No! - Don't. - Stop. You wish to fight the mighty Gunner? - Get me in there. - Ingrid, no! - Get me in there! - The floor is yours. - Oh God. - Loki. - No! - It's not fair match! She will not stand a chance! - Right, your fancy girl. - Have it, it's you and I to the death. - Now the ultimate thrill. - Gunner! - And hands they go. - Join! - No! - Give in! - If the girl is all you really have, I will take her from you. See if you find your beast then. - Come here. Stand. Come on. - You wish to take my son? Not before I take you. - Father! You've bad habits in you, boy. - You'll cut now? Let us fight! You're my father, I should have forgotten you, your face, your voice, and every living memory. You are a murdering savage! - That's it, that's my boy. - Goodbye, Father. - No! - Stop! Everybody stop I command you! The war between the Saxons and Berserkers ends here! - Rolf, Rolf! Rolf, it's me. It is me. It's over, the war is over. It's over! The war is over! It's ended! Rolf. - Ingrid. - Have your wounds healed? - I'm recovering, yours? - Much better. The townspeople who fled to the west, they have returned. They are so grateful for what you did. - We did. - You are the main reason why everything has gone back to how it should be. You did this. - My father said I was exactly like him. When I felt that surge of fury and anger through my body, I understood it. - You are nothing like your father. - No but I am, I am. I'm exactly like him. The difference is I care more about people than the Berserker pride. He never understood that. - Welcome to the new world. ♪ The road it cares ♪ And a journey there ♪ The dark will pass ♪ And hope will last ♪ Hope inside you cannot see ♪ A purple with thee ♪ If the sun should sink to rise ♪ ♪ We will see the brand new sky ♪ ♪ And we'll leave behind ♪ The sins of your past ♪ If the sun should sink to rise ♪ ♪ We will see the brand new sky ♪ ♪ And we'll leave behind ♪ The sins of the past
