I'd like a cigarette, then, please. Sure. There we go. You're not under arrest. I know you've had a really hell of a night, so if you don't mind, we just want to ask you a few questions about what happened. Look, guys, I didn't do anything wrong, all right? No one's saying you did. No one's saying you did. But it's just, you know, when we see stuff like this, then you get a couple questions to answer. I know you've had a rough night, okay? That's a lot of blood. Yeah, it is. Do you have any idea how all that blood got there? I already told you guys my buddies got shot. And you shot them? No. Who did shoot them? I don't know. I-I think it was this guy Scott Roberts. Who... who... who's Scott Roberts? He's the one that took Alyssa... kidnapped her, yeah. He... she was doing a film with Scott Roberts. He's a porn producer. She ended up missing. We went looking for her. And then did you guys go down to slaughter creek? What... what are you doing? Dude, I don't even think we're on the road. We got to keep it together, okay? We can't help her if we don't keep it together. Mya, there's a million fucking barns in every direction out here. What fucking barn is it?! God damn it! Why the fuck did we shoot this fucking documentary?! Turn the fucking camera off, Robbie! Get the fuck out of here! God fucking damn it! Matt! Get the fucking camera out of my face! Matt! You have the picture. That's the barn, right? That's the barn. Okay, so, Scott Roberts shot your friends and decided to let you live. You ran out in the barn. Yeah. Why were you in the barn again? I told you... I was looking for Alyssa. Alyssa... that's right. The same Alyssa you reported missing? Yes, we were shooting a documentary about it. Do you want to handle this? Hey, guys. How you doing, officer? I'm officer corbett with the Lockhart police department. Okay. Reason I'm making contact with you is I have had some complaints from some citizens about y'all walking around. What exactly is going on here today? We're actually just shooting a bit of a documentary. And I'm... I'm actually glad you pulled up, because we're looking for a girl. Okay. How old is this girl? She's 19. 19 years old. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So she is an adult? Yes. Okay. What's her name? It's Matt. No, her name... her name. I'm sorry. Um, Alyssa. Alyssa? Yeah. Okay. How do you know Alyssa? Um, we were just shooting a documentary about, um, actresses. She's an actress. She's an actress. She was working with us. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um. Does she live here? No, she lives in Austin. In Austin. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, Austin... that's where she's missing from... her apartment in Austin? Yeah. Because she is an adult, she's 19, and she has every right to, you know, pack up and leave if she wants to... Sure. But, definitely, if there's any... if it's not right or if it's some kind of odd circumstances... she would have... she would have told us something by now. Okay. Okay. It's not like her to just bail out like this, so... Okay, so it's not... not in her character. She had no reason to just up and leave, no debts... anything like that, then? I mean, I... no. Okay. Okay. All right, well, I-I think it is important that we go ahead and at least get the process started, so that we can look for her. If you hear anything, definitely give the police station a call. So, what are we doing? We're doing something... That's what we're doing. We're not doing anything. We're walking around this town. We have no idea where we're going. Do you want to sit at home and just wait for a fucking phone call? 'Cause that's not what's gonna happen. What's the point of this? This way. Seems kind of pointless, Matt. Yeah, well, I don't know what else to do, okay? So... Let me ask a few more people if they might know anything, and then... we'll take it from there. I don't know, guys. I... do you want to just sit at home and do nothing? Just wait for a fucking phone call? It can't happen. Hi, guys. Sorry to s-startle you a little bit. Um, have you guys seen a... a film crew around here or, um... No, we're just... we're looking at some real-estate property and came out. We haven't seen anybody around. Okay. Thanks, guys. You're welcome. Appreciate it. So, what... wait. What... what is this about the other film crew? I thought you guys were the ones doing the documentary. Yeah, we were. Okay, now, here's... here's what's gonna happen next, okay? We're gonna back up a bit. I want you to start from the beginning. You, Mya, Robbie... you arrive in Austin. Why? To shoot a documentary. ♪ Well, I never been to Spain ♪ so, greetings, America. Here we are, about to embark on our first documentary, where we will be shooting, a documentary about the porn industry. Excuse me. Do you know where bull McCabe's is... Irish pub? Yes. Where is it? This is it, right? Yeah. Look at this. Bull McCabe's. With the two steps. Can you get a shot of that? You fix it. You fix it. Are you Johnny? Yeah, man. What's up? Hey, Johnny. Jerry sent us. He said it's okay if... Jerry sent you? Hey, Matt, here's a question. What's up? Why porn? Why... out of all the things we could have made on... good causes, starving children... you pick porn. Why not porn? Because it's taboo in America right now, because it needs to be talked about. So, you don't think there's anything wrong with an 18-, 19-year-old girl that's got no direction, no money, nowhere to go getting totally taken advantage of? Well, they're not getting taken advantage of. And, plus, these girls that have no money are making very nice money, actually, doing not really any kind of work. Yeah, but they're... it's a pretty nice gig. They're degrading themselves. Anyone else? Nice party. Come on, Nancy boy. Slainte. Slainte. Sorry. That's right. ♪ But I really don't remember ♪ hey. ♪ In Oklahoma ♪ if you'll excuse me... ♪ not Arizona ♪ don't pee on your Mike. ♪ What does it matter? ♪ I'll pee where I want to pee. Don't pee on your Mike. Yeah, don't... hey, why don't you leave your Mike with me? And don't take the camera. What are you doing? I keeps it real. God. No, Robbie. Don't drop that. Good morning. I'm Robbie. This is day 1 of a documentary that I'm doing with my friend Matt, and he sort of needs my help. And he did help me a lot on my last one, so I have a little extra money that I thought i'd help him invest, as well as our friend Mya, which... that's a whole different story. I'm not quite sure how I suddenly found myself doing this. Matt just called me out of the blue, um, a couple of days ago, and... Yeah, I hadn't heard from him in a while, but I guess I was glad to. So, yeah, he talked me into this in that magical way he has of just getting people to do, um, sometimes stupid things. Time to pee-pee. Got to pee-pee. I don't know, in terms of me and Matt working together, how that's gonna go, but I guess i'm interested to find out. And so, I think there's a topic we need to address here. You, previously have dated, right? Yes. Want to give us a little rundown on that relationship? This is documentary about Mya now... me and Mya's past relationship? This is Robbie... this is Robbie's "be real" extra features. Extra features. Okay. I can go with that. Yeah, we used to date. We dated on and off throughout college, and now we're just friends, so... Just friends? Yeah. So we're not gonna have any weird tension? No, we're not gonna have any weird tension. You're not gonna make Robbie a third wheel? No, I would never do that to you. Robbie does not like being a third wheel. I know. All right, if I'm there, you guys are... I don't know... Starting to get a little feelings? Strictly business. Strictly business. Okay. That's it. There's no desire? No desire. Really? None. The desire is dead. What does that mean? What... Action. I know. Don't mind me. What's up, buddy? Don't mind me. Are you shooting a porno? You tell me. I'm okay with it if you're okay with it. No? I don't think so. Are you camera-shy? Come on. Make it sexy. Come on. Okay, let's go. What? Thanks a lot, Robbie. Robbie. You look good. God. No. Um. But I don't know. We'll see how it goes. I mean, things often exceed my expectations, considering how low they start out at. We just need to get out of here, so can you pack your crap up? And let's go. Did you check the list? Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's go. We're running late. I hope they have coffee there. This is bright and early for a porn star, it seems, so... The porn industry is a $10 million-a-year industry. Billion. Billion. I think sometimes happened with Matt and Mya. I vaguely recall a kiss was shared. Sadly, I wasn't involved with that, but I think I'm gonna ask some probing questions and get to the bottom of this... see what really happened. Rolling. Okay. The porn industry is a $10... action! The porn indus... action. Come on. Robbie, please. Am I squinting too much? Yeah, but that's probably 'cause you're way too hung over. Okay, whatever. Um, okay, so you want me to blab about my deep, fantastic feelings about whatever happened with Matt yesterday? Um, you know what? I'm gonna... I'm gonna see what happens. Ready? Action! The porn industry is a $10 billion-a-year business, and we're about to crack the egg on what it... the... the taboos of sex in America really are. Again with the egg? Yeah, she's a great kisser. It was a lot of fun... might have been a mistake, though. Ready? Yeah, still ready. Here we are at the cattle call, where we're gonna make a documentary about the porn industry. Let's go inside, and let's check it out. All right, I like that. Simple, brief... it's good. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Check your Mike, please. Yeah. We're good. Okay. Just... yeah, I'll just try to stay out of the frame. Yeah. Um. Appreciate that. Okay, ready? So, we are here for the porn audition interview. You'll be able to see right back there. Just sneaking a peek over there, guys. How are we doing today? Good. Awesome. Well, um, we had permission from the director to shoot a bit of an interview with you guys. We're just gonna talk about the porn industry, maybe go a little bit more in depth about your lives, growing up, how you got into the porn industry... Okay. Signature moves... Stuff like that. Whoo! I already know what yours is. Yeah. Um, you guys look awesome today. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Ooh, very beautiful. I'm... I'm considering changing occupations. Um, so if you would, please, if you're open to it... are you guys okay with that? Yeah. Yeah? With everything. Keen? All right. My name is kiki sugarloaf. Kiki sugarloaf? Candy trails? Yeah. That's your real name, right? That... sure, that's my real name. My name's kitty. Kitty. Yeah, just kitty. My name is Karina, but they call me "Nina." Jezebel? Yes. Well, I'm Vivian amore. Vivian amore? A-m-o-r-e. How old are you, jezebel? I'm 23, sir. I'm 20. I'm 25. A good girl never tells her age. I don't like any other girls, 'cause my vagina's the prettiest, and I don't want them to feel insignificant. How many films have you been in? Only four. Only four? So you're just getting started. I'm fresh. You know what? You lose count after a while. I really want to create a movie that has such a strong element of love and just give porn a whole new name and get it out of the... the derogatory, negative stigma that it has, you know? Yeah. 'Cause there's some really good acting that can happen. And you... and those scenes... Those sex scenes can be so pivotal. You name it... I've probably seen it and done it. I'm mostly known for my anal work. Do girl on girl. That could actually make me have an orgasm, but it's a different kind of orgasm altogether. Your parents don't approve? They don't approve. Interesting. But I-I secretly think they watch it. Do you... do you guys... Do you guys lube up? What do you... how do you... How do you do that? Do you spit? Do you use lube? What... what do you do? We're young. We're wet. I think if you're... yeah, if you're in the mood, it'll happen naturally. Yeah. Is it hard sometimes to get into the mood with the cameras and lights and everybody watching you? I just think that, as long as you're really focused... um, i-i like to focus my energy on connecting with my partner. Interesting. And it makes everything really nice. I know it's the first day, but this does not bode well. Those girls are ridiculous. They're like caricatures. They don't even seem like real people. And Matt... He needs to get it together around these girls. He just... he's a mess. He's falling all over himself. He acts like he's fucking speed-dating instead of getting interviews here. We are fucked if this is the best we can do. I'm starting to feel like a porn star. If you want to feel more like a porn star, call me. Really? I-I might. Who knows? Matt. Matt. Yeah? I think we got what we need. We got what we need? We got it. We got it. We're good? Um, great, guys. Thank you so much. Um, we'll be in touch. Please, fill... finish your release forms for me. And we might even pull a few of you girls off to the side and do some more one-on-one interviews and find out a little bit more about you. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate it. Made my day. Bye, sweetie. Excellent. Cut. Watch it. Thanks. So, Matt, how do you feel that went? It went okay. Yeah? I think it went really well. How... how do you guys feel about it? Mya? Um, excuse me. Yeah? Hey, is this where the audition's at? Yes, it is. Thank you. Hey, hold on a second. So, I just want to thank you so much for doing this interview with us. You're welcome. Would you start off by telling us your name... telling me your name? Telling you my name? Yeah. My name is Alyssa. And how old are you, Alyssa? I'm 19. 19 years old. Yeah. Wow. Wow. What was that? That's young. Is it? Well, yeah, you're still a teen... 19 years old, but... okay, but I'm... but i'm legal. Did you graduate from high school? Yeah, I graduated. Great. Cool. Yeah, of course I graduated. Cool. Sorry, I didn't... what is this for? Is this gonna be on TV? Um, that's what we're hoping for, yeah. Really? Absolutely. Okay, cool. Yeah, so, I think you're gonna be our star, too. You're, by far, the prettiest one that we've interviewed today. Are you serious? Yeah, hands down. You're embarrassing me. No. Yeah, um, this is actually a documentary about the, porn industry. You originally were pursuing mainstream acting, and now you're pursuing, porn? Well... I mean, I'm not, like, pursuing it. I've never... like, I've never done anything. You haven't done anything? No. You've never been in a porn? So this is your first audition or... Well, yeah, this is... yeah, kind of. I mean, do you still even want to interview me? 'Cause I've never, like, done... Ever done anything, you know? Absolutely. I-I think you're even more intriguing now that you've never... really? Yeah, absolutely. I am? Um, yeah. I'd like to find out why... What... what brought you here, why you're here. Well, I was in L.A. 'cause I've always wanted to be an actress. I mean, it was so cool just watching people on TV and just... it's what I've always wanted to do. You know, you always hear, like, "every experience is a good experience." You know, maybe... You know, and... you know, there's bills and, you know, rent and all that, so... Yeah. Okay. I have to pay those. Yeah. Um, so, are... are you a little bit concerned about, um, maybe, you know, your mainstream-acting career being ruined by pursuing this dream? Because, a lot of times, actresses can't make the transition from... from porn to mainstream acting, once they've done porn. Um. Yeah. So, it's, um... I mean... I'm just wondering... What's... what's... no, I... Is this kind of a last resort for you or... I have a feeling that, if you try really hard, you could tell us where Alyssa is. Where is she, Matt? Look, man, I don't know. I think something really bad happened to her, all right? Why don't you guys fucking believe me, man? What did you guys think about Alyssa, her story? What story? What... like... She's from... she's from a small town in Missouri. She's 19 years old. Dude, they're all from a small town in wherever. No, but that she's different. She's... she hasn't done any porn yet. She's... she's on her way into the industry. We should... we should record that. We should record that journey. You couldn't get anything interesting out of the parade of freak-show porn stars... Kiki sugarloaf? But this girl is interesting to you. No, it's been done before. I'm gonna venture to say that your interest is maybe not so related to the documentary. Let's not... no. No. Mya... This is why... Our relationship didn't work out in the fucking first place, okay? Because you don't fucking listen. You're not receptive to anything that I'm trying to convey. And... the whole point of this fucking documentary is... if you want to make a documentary about the porn industry, guess what... There's a thousand other documentaries out there, okay? It's been done before. Alyssa has not yet crossed over to the dark side. And we're gonna follow her on that journey into the dark side. And it's gonna be sad, and it's gonna be fucked up, but you know what? That's life. What... where do you think the interest lies? Okay. Can you... can you... Can you tuck away all your fucking bullshit right now... I think Mya was making a point. And focus on what we're really trying to do here, which is make a... you're all the bullshit that I have to deal with. I'm talking about making a significant documentary here, okay? What we're trying to do... you're delusional. Well, you're fucking delusional because what we're doing right now isn't working... That's obvious to us, okay? Because you suck. That's why it's not working. I'm out of here. Boy. Um. Think the tortas are good here? We're gonna follow this girl who grew up with a normal life, who tried to make it in mainstream acting, who's fallen off, into this fucking horrible pit of god-awful evilness, and we're gonna fucking show the world what happens when you get off your path. A-And that's exactly the point. And... and, my god, if... Imagine what would happen if we weren't there. Hey. Alyssa. It's just about following an aspiring actress into... into the film world. So is there any way I can get compensation for maybe doing that? Um, we could probably work that out. Okay, but, I mean, that's good. What... what are you thinking? Um, probably like $500. I mean, that would be enough to really cover my rent and bills. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay. So, she wants to do it. She's cool with it. We're good to go. How much money does she want? Um. She wants $500. Well, that's the end of that. I'm not fucking paying some no-name actress... I'm not talking about your money. This is nothing but publicity for her. I'm not talking about your money. We're not fucking paying her. It's ridiculous. We don't have to give her a thing. There's no way. We can't do it. Why don't you stay inside for a minute, okay? She shouldn't get fucking anything. I'll gonna go have a smoke. I mean, I think this is a positive thing. I don't think we're necessarily exploiting her in a bad way. Hello? Hey, Alyssa. Yeah, I got it. I've got the money. Okay, great. Where can I meet you at? Um, want to come by my apartment? Somebody who was a porn star in 1972 or whatever, what... you know, how much money could they possibly have? But didn't they kind of do that already with countless other porn documentaries? What are you guys talking about in here? Talking about what else we can do. Let me show you guys something. What are you doing? All right, there's a night's work. Thank you. Very dramatic. Thanks. All right, Matt, we already went down that road. No, we got her. I talked to her last night. She's agreed to do the film. She's gonna do it for no money? Yeah. So, here we are at Alyssa's apartment. Um, we're gonna find out a little bit more about her, hopefully, and, um, maybe follow her journey into the industry. So, okay, where do you want me? Right here. Is that good? Yes, we got... we're all set up. We got you lit up. Cool. You're gonna look great. Thank you for the $500. You're welcome. What money? Matt? I had to compensate her, guys. How much money, Matt? $500, Mya. Can we talk about it later? I knew it. I-I had to compensate her somehow, Mya. Son of a bitch. Unbelievable. I'm done. Really, Matt? Um, can you excuse me just for one second? It's a little bit of a malfunction. Yeah. I'll be right back, okay? Okay. Matt, what money? Stay here, Robbie. Man. Mya. Can you stay in there with Alyssa, actually? I'm not staying here with Alyssa. What else have you been lying about? Hey, Mya. Now, this is gonna be great. I'm gonna document each and every one of your lies, Matt. Hey, Mya, can I talk to you for a second? No. Please? You're done talking. I'm not done talking. Every time you open your mouth, you're a fucking liar. You'd better not. I'm not gonna touch you. Just... Will you... will you just please listen to me? Why is she gonna listen to you now? Really, it's like he doesn't even care. He's just being selfish and doing what he wants. All of our fucking money... Fuck you, asshole! Hey, hey. Fuck you. Mya, Mya, listen to me. Get the fuck off of me! Hey. That money should be going to the production, not to some single actress. It's a fucking investment, Robbie. It's an... she is an asset, okay? It was not your money. The original idea for the documentary went to shit, okay? We got a bunch of fucking rubbish. Finally, the truth. Okay, so I'm pissed, all right? I know it's, like, usually good-time Robbie or whatever. And... and Matt wants to go around and do what Matt does, and we're supposed to just follow along and be cool with it, but damn it, like, enough's enough. Okay? Liar, liar, liar, fucking liar! You have to pay your actresses. You can't make a movie without... she's not an actress! It's a documentary. We're not supposed to be paying them. She's trying to become an actress, she wants money, and she's gonna do it on fucking camera, all right? My heart swells for her! Well, what do you want to do, then? You tell me. You tell me what you want to do, what we should do. No, Mr. Director, it's not my job to tell you what to do. You do everything on your own! We had... he has taken us straight down to screwedville. Please, let's just finish it. Come on, Mya. Get this done, and then i'm done with you. I don't ever want to hear from you again. I don't want to see you again after this. I don't want to talk to you. That's it. I don't believe that, but thank you. Fuck you. Believe it. Okay, can we... don't! Hey, this tension... hold on. No! No! Before... before you go in there... I can be a professional in there. Did I do this in there, or did I do it out here? Shh! Don't fucking do that with me. She can hear you in there. I don't give a shit. But let's not bring that energy in the room, okay? Okay. Sorry about that. It's okay. Is everything all right? Everything's totally cool, absolutely. Um. Are you lying? No, I'm not lying. I noticed you had a steelers Jersey on. Thank you. Yes, I do. You're a football fan? I am. I am. I'm one of those girls. Really? Yeah. And you like beer? Yes. My gosh. I'm in love. I knew you would be. No, I'm just joking. Just a matter of time. You're just joking? No, no, no. Well, it's... you're not just joking. No, no, no. It's only a matter of time. Right. I was always surrounded by people. And then, when I was in California, I lived with somebody. So this is kind of my own space. I don't know. Nice. It's kind of a neat feeling. Hey, Mya, can we keep this out of frame, please? Okay. Still rolling. Just start. All right. Um, so... Sorry. I'm getting distracted here. No, it's fine. Um, it's been a really long week. And we had a long night, so... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, cool. So, do you... does... does your family know about what you're about to get into, or is that just, like, not even an option? Like, they can't find out, or would they be open to you going into this industry? How... how do they... how would they feel about that, if... I mean, do they know or... that you're... Um. No. No. I just think this is like one... one phase in my life they just don't need to know about, you know? Well, it was actually out when I was in L.A., so it wasn't that long ago. I had gone over to one of his, like, I guess one of his, like, work acquaintances' house. I'd met him... the guy... once before at a work party with him that I'd gone to. And, um, we were all just drinking. There was, like, a sliding glass door... like, it would be, like, right here, and there was a bedroom in it. And there was also a balcony door going through the living room. And I remember Michael standing outside, being very sick over the balcony. And I went... I didn't want to embarrass him by going, you know, out there. And so I went around to the bedroom to look through the... The glass to see if it was okay... or if he was okay. And when I went in there, the other guy had followed me in there. I'm sorry. It's just... it's a hard story to tell. Um. It's okay. So... so, he... He came in there. And he knew I wanted to be an actress, so, I mean, that was kind of something, I guess, Michael had told him or something. I just remember him pushing me down on the bed and, like, you know, hold... like, physically holding me down with his legs and everything and ripping off parts of my clothes. He, you know, kind of loosened his grip, and I remember trying to run out. And then, one thing I do remember him saying to me as he, like, stopped me at the door, was, "don't pull your actress shit on me, bitch." Wow. Yeah. So, that was kind of... Yeah, that was... Welcome to L.A. Yeah. It sounds to me like you had your hands chock full of trouble. Sleeping with two girls at the same time? Now, that's messy. What? You weren't? No, no. I was not sleeping with both of them at the same time. But you gave her $500, though, right? So you're telling us that you gave Alyssa $500 to participate in your documentary, then she didn't, which leads me to believe that the $500 was for something else. I wonder what it was. $500 is a whole lot of Alyssa. I want to get the fuck out of here. Excuse us for a second, Matt. I'm starving. So, Matt, that's a $500 interview right there? No, it's not a $500 interview. There's a lot more to shoot. I hope so. Hey, wait. Mya, what are you doing? Mya, what are you doing? Mya, you don't have to do that. I'll... I'll... I'll clean up my... Um, there's no need to clean up. That's where your shit lives now. Okay. Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Let's... let's get some calm heads here. I'm very calm. This is as calm as I'm gonna get for the rest of the shoot. Okay. That doesn't mean you guys can't still share beds. We're... You've got to be out of your mind. I'll sleep with Robbie. I don't care. Yeah, that's right. You will. You don't have to sleep with Robbie. I do sleep in the nude, though, so fair warning. Don't be a jerk, Mya. Come on. You'll be nice and cozy. You'll enjoy it. Aw, crap. Come on. You guys should really try to make up. You better move away from me. How long is this gonna last? Don't make me fucking do this again! All right. We're gonna wrap this up in a bit. I just need to get clear on a few more things. That had to be tough for you, working with the ex-girlfriend every day, seeing each other... I mean, emotionally, it was rough on you. No, everything was fine. Everything... everything between me and Mya was fine. We're friends now. We used to date, but we were friends. I'm sure you're friends, but, I mean, you get those same situations... the heart starts bubbling a little bit, you know? I think he was still fucking her. Is that true? Yeah. So what? Now you got me curious. How did Mya feel about Alyssa? If I had to guess, I'd say you... you found yourself in some trouble. Did Mya like Alyssa? No, not... not particularly. Were you having any troubles with her? Were you guys getting into fights all the time or something? Who... me and Alyssa? You and Mya. Everything was fine between me and Mya... no. Matt... every time we try to talk, it... Doesn't go that well. There's... there's none of this confrontation going into it. How do you expect me to feel, honestly, when you go from me to some fucking airhead, brainless 19-year-old... which, by the way, ew! Um. Could you just stop speaking? Could you just stay in the car while I go talk to her a minute? Shut the fuck up! You're such an asshole! God damn it! Shut up! You keep coming back to me, and when it's good, it's good, and I know you know that. But there's always some Alyssa. Mya. You act the way you act the other night, and then you are... You can't even keep your fucking tongue in your head when you're talking to her. So... I'm gonna keep myself together until we're done with this project. And... i guess, afterward... I don't know. You can... Make whatever move you're gonna make, but you've got to make one, and you have to stick with it, 'cause I'm... i'm right there, and I'm willing to do it if you want to honestly give this a try, but I need your full attention. I need to know that you're not gonna bail on me. She's young and naive, okay? What do you think? How do you expect people to react to you when you act like this? You have to talk to 19-year-olds differently than you talk to someone that's 25. Okay. Especially when you're trying to get in their pants. Mya, the tension that... that we're feeling... I get it. I get it. Alyssa's gonna feel it. I get it. So we need to get over this hump, okay? You just keep talking. I get it. All right. I'm done. I just want to make sure that we're on the same... You're killing me. Page here. Hello? Hey, it's Alyssa. Hey. Hey, I got my first audition tomorrow. Do you want to come? Yeah. I'm going to meet a producer. What time? It's at 1:15. What time? It's at 1:15. But is there any way you guys could maybe come pick me up? Okay. She has her first audition tomorrow. Let's keep this ball rolling. We good? Mya? So, tell us a little bit about what you're feeling right now. I feel... A little nervous. A little nervous? Yeah. I don't... I mean, I don't know, really, what to... Don't really know what to expect, you know? I just... Do you know much about this production company or this... No, I mean... I mean... No, I mean, I think they're... I think they're legitimate. It's... he sounded like he... You know, he's done a lot of work and stuff, so... Yeah, I mean, they're good. And Jennifer has worked with this guy before... that's how you... how you found out about him? I don't know if she's worked with him or if her friend has. I didn't ask her that. But, I mean, they said it's... It's fine. Okay. Hey, Alyssa, wait up. Yeah. Um, listen... If you don't feel comfortable doing anything, you can say "no." You don't have to do it. I know. Okay? Just know your limitations before you go in, okay? Matt, it's gonna... gonna be fine. Okay. We're gonna be right here, all right? Um, I know it's a long shot, but try to be persuasive when you talk to him. Okay. Okay. Definitely. Okay. And don't worry... I'm gonna be fine. Okay. See you in a minute. Be right here, okay? Right there. Don't leave. Got my phone on me, too. Okay. You're late. Hey. I'll take get back. I'm filming a documentary. Is there any way that the crew can come in and maybe film some stuff here with us, please? The crew's here? Yeah, do you think they could just... I don't want them anywhere near here. Sir, I have a... I have a contract here. No, I don't care about your contract. Get away from my property. And... and if you want this job, just get in here. Okay. You better not be here when we get back out. I'm not on your property, sir. Did you really think they were gonna let us shoot in here? I didn't think we were gonna end up at a fucking house. I thought we were going to a legitimate studio... What's legitimate about this? With legitimate people. Don't know about legitimate. So, are we just gonna wait? Is this documentary about Matt now? Get in the fucking Van. Dude, well, what's Matt's deal? He seem a little too worked up? Are you really that surprised? Why? You think he's into her? Do you think? Is he jealous? She's doing a job. Yeah, I bet he is jealous. You know, this whole time, we've been in this tunnel, and I finally see the light, and that light is Alyssa. Hey, you all right? I'm fine. Now just move. Okay. Please. Let's go. Get... get in the front, Robbie. Hey, Alyssa. Alyssa. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Matt, just let me go inside, okay? Alyssa, hey. Can I talk to you for a second, please? No, don't touch me! What happened in there? What's wrong? What's going on? Did he touch you? I got the part. You got the part. Is that what you wanted? Yeah? Then why are you so emotional right now? Well, I'll... I'll call you later tonight, and, we'll be back here, tomorrow, and we'll talk about it then, okay? Matt, I can't... I can't keep shooting the documentary with you. Why not? What do you mean you can't keep shooting the documentary with me? The producer's not gonna... what does that mean? The producer's not gonna let me. I'm supposed to just risk everything for $500? Alyssa... that's all the money I have. I know it's not much, but that is all I've got. I've put everything on the line for you. You can't just bail on me right now. That's not an option. So you're gonna make me feel guilty? You're gonna... so you're gonna quit this documentary and you're gonna go do homemade fucking porn? Alyssa, that's about the saddest fucking ending to a story I've ever heard of in my entire fucking life. Don't say it like that! It's the truth. I'm really sorry, and i'm gonna give you all of your money back. I don't want my money back... I want you back. Alyssa, quit... look, I'm... Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Alyssa. Please don't touch me, Matt. Please stop. Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry, okay? Stop, please. Listen to me. Listen to me, okay? Just rethink, okay? Just... just gather yourself for a second, okay? Is this what you really want to do? Do you really want to go into porn? I mean, is that something that you have to do? Do you really want to do this? Can you not wait tables? Can you... is there just no other option? You can't do anything else? I don't know, Matt. I don't know, Matt. I just... I just want to be... I just want to be left alone, okay? Alyssa, listen to me. Matt, just... Hey, Alyssa. Stop. So, Matt... So, what? There isn't anything you, feel like telling us? What's that supposed to mean? Your Mike's been on, dumbass. Aren't you curious, Robbie? What am I missing here? God damn it. Mya, what is he talking... What is... what is going on? Well, would you rather hear it from me or him? I just want to hear it... Somebody. Go ahead. Alyssa's not doing the documentary. What? Let me get... let me get something straight. Now, you tell me how you feel about this. You mentioned that Alyssa had burned you for a few bucks, right? How much was that? $500. $500. Wow. So, Alyssa burns you for $500, and you get pissed... And you kill her. Mya and Robbie find out about it. You kill them, too. How does that sound? Guys, please, all right? I just wanted to make a documentary, all right? I didn't care about the fucking $500. I'm not gonna kill somebody over $500. Come on. You didn't care that she took the money and didn't participate in your documentary because she gave you something else... $500 worth? That sound close? That sound right? Am I close? No, you're not, man. You're not even fucking close. I want to get the fuck out of here. Excuse us for a second, Matt. I'm starving. Alyssa, please answer the door. It's Matt. I need to talk to you. Alyssa, please come to the door. I need to talk to you. It's Matt. Hello. You've reached the desk of Jerry Cooper. If you have a scoop or a story, let me know. You just might be in the paper next week. Hey, Jerry, it's Matt, man. S-sorry if I woke you up. Um, when you get this message in the morning, please call me back. I need you to do me a favor and find out as much as you can about Scott Roberts. He's a porn producer. Alyssa! It's Matt! If you're in there, please come to the door! I need to talk to you. I need to know if you're all right. Um, I have some general concerns, um, about him. What are you gonna do about it? Yeah, you're gonna tell us, but we're pretty much still screwed. Give me a call in the morning when you wake up, or I'll call you. Thanks, Jerry. Bye. You're so full of shit. How do you even listen to yourself and... and stand it? If you have any better ideas, I'm open to... to hear them, but until then, like, I don't know. Check your fucking attitude, man, because I told you, when we started this thing, we're gonna have to fucking wing it. This is guerrilla filmmaking. This is beyond winging it. My god. Hey, it's Alyssa. Alyssa? I'm not here right now, but leave me a message... Damn it! And I'll call you back. Alyssa, it's Matt. Look, I've got to see you. We've got to talk. I-I gave you... I gave you the last of our money. Everyone is pissed at me. And I'm worried about you, and I just don't feel right, okay? Okay, bye. Boy. Been a long day. Let's get this straight. All right. So, you went to her apartment that night. Yeah, to give her the money. All right. Did you have a camera with you, one of those video cameras? Yeah, I-I don't remember. I think it was in the Van. Matt. Matt. Come on, man. Look, man, what's that got to do with anything? You had a camera with you. You went over to her apartment. Did you happen to photograph her that night, too? No. Did you ask her nicely to take her clothes off, or did you make her? No fucking way. I didn't touch her. All right. So, your statement is you went there with a camera... maybe to the Van, maybe it isn't... you go inside to give her some money, and... Nothing happened. Look. I didn't fucking touch her, man. Why don't you watch this? Look. This will be amazing. Why don't you watch this? This will be amazing. Take your shirt off. Go ahead... Take it off. Very nice. Remove your bra. Look back at me. Are you nervous? Don't be. Lay down on the bed. Let me see those eyes. Are you scared? Don't be. Matt, if there was ever a good time to change your story... Right now would be that time. Come on, Matt. Do you want to change your story?! I think she'll find that, doing this documentary's going to help her more than hurt her, so... Mya. You are delusional. That's the shit I'm talking about. I'm not participating in any more of your fucking delusions. Could you just stay in the car while I go talk to her a minute? Shut the fuck up! You're such an asshole! God damn it! Shut up! Ring the bell. She's not fucking home, man. Alyssa. Jennifer. Please come to the door if you're in there. Hi. Can I help you with something? Hey, um, yeah. Are you their neighbor... Jennifer and Alyssa's? No, actually, I'm the landlord. What can I do for you? You're the landlord. Yeah. Great. Um, I'm just trying to find Alyssa. They moved out last night. What? Yeah, a couple of guys and her... they packed up a big truck and headed out. Who... what guys? Said she... what... what are you talking about? She had two big guys with her. They had a truck, and they just loaded everything out. I just saw her the other day. Yeah? She had she had some job going on... a movie. Matt, he's not home. Matt! You got to be kidding me. Matt, no! Matt. We got to go! Matt! This isn't good. My god. What's he doing? I don't know. Shut up. Mya, just relax. I'm just gonna go check on him. I'll be right back. Fuck! Dude, what the fuck are you doing?! Shh! What are you doing?! Shut the fuck up. Doesn't look like anybody's home. Yeah. We shouldn't even be here. What are you... come on. It's unlocked. My god. You... shh! Matt. If you're coming, I want you to shut the fuck up. What are you even looking for? Shh! This is so stupid. Matt, what are you doing?! There's lots of tapes. How fucking great. Get them. Let's go. Matt, what are you doing? Just grab them and go. Come on. Let's go. I got some tapes. What the fuck is going on?! Come on! Run! Come on. Go, go. Hey, this one says "slaughter creek." What? What do you mean it says "slaughter creek"? Matt, just give me the tape. No! Please! Please! No! No! Please! Aaah! Please, no! Please! No! No, please! Look at that. No! Where's my phone? Who you gonna call? I'm calling Alyssa. Hey, it's Alyssa. Leave me a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, Alyssa, it's... it's Matt. Um, I really need you to call me back. Um, I'm afraid what you're getting into, um, is not what you think. I'm not calling you about the documentary. I'm calling you as a friend. Please call me back. Please. Give it up, Matt. Come on, man. You got to talk about it. This is some of the sickest shit that I've ever seen. And what's this... what this you got on? You got your favorite rape. Bondage. Sadomasochism. Dude, what the fuck's wrong with you? And, yeah, our personal favorite... you want to watch this with us? Get some popcorn. We'll put this in for you. What do you say? Hey. Glad to see you found the place. Are you the broker I spoke to on the phone? So... a coat of paint... Wow. This place is huge. What's all this? Making a little movie here. Really? Well, what's it all about? It's about a woman looking to buy a piece of property, who gets a break for being in the movie... you know, $50,000? $50,000? I'm not comfortable with this. I can't do this anymore. I changed my mind. Aah! Aah! Aaah! Please! No! No! No! Please, please. Please, no! Aah! She's still breathing. Somebody made that tape, Matt. There's a dead girl on that tape, Matt. We know you did it. Look, guys. All right, look... I got these tapes from a guy's house where I thought Alyssa might have been. I didn't know what I was looking for. Then I went into his home. I found this box of tapes. I took them back to my motel and watched it. You broke into a house. Yeah, I stole the tapes. Well, what guy? What house? What house?! What guy?! We need you to start talking, Matt. The truth, Matt! Come on! Come on, guys. Come on. Whose house was it?! Scott Roberts'! Again with Scott Roberts! Stop staying his name! You keep saying his name! You said so yourself... you have no idea who Scott Roberts is! You've never seen him! You've never met him! Why do you keep accusing Scott Roberts of what you did... Of what you did?! There's a dead girl on that tape! I swear to god, man. Why don't you guys fucking believe me? It's... Hey, Matt, why don't we just get in the Van and drive around? Hang on a second. Hello. This Jerry at the Dallas times. Can I help you? Hey, Jerry. Yeah, Matt. Hey. Yeah, Matt. Did you get anything? Listen, man, I found out a lot of stuff about Mr. Scott Roberts. Can you... now, listen, you got a fax machine? Yeah. Um, hang on a second. This guy ain't no freaking Saint. Matt, what'd you get yourself into? You guys have a fax machine I could use? No? Thanks. Appreciate it. Give me two seconds, okay? Man, this ain't high school, dude. Watch your step, Robbie. You might be in over your head on this. Excuse me, ma'am? Yes, sir? How are you? Do you work here? Yes, I do. Do you guys have a fax machine? We do. So, what does it say in the fax? Look for yourself. Case after case after case of sexual acts of abuse. All of them have been dismissed, every single one... Which means he has friends in high places... Which means if he does make snuff films, it's probably bought from fucking judges and politicians and god knows who else. No one's gonna let him make snuff films. Some sick fuckers out there, man. What's this aerial shot? Is this his property? Yeah. Is this a barn or something in this picture? That's what it looks like, Mya. Are there any land markings around the barn that we can... it's just empty field. Just an empty field? Looks like there's a house or something next to it. There's something else that looks like a building. Just a long drive up to it. Let me see that. Which way should I go? Flip a coin. I mean, we don't have any information to go on. Just point me in a direction. Just do it, right? Do you think it would be a good idea to ask somebody? Ask them what? Do you guys see anybody? Nope. This place is dead. See anybody? Sir, how you doing today? Um, listen, I got a... we're trying to find a-a barn out here. We're shooting just a bit of a documentary. Um, we know that it's off this road. This here's about... It's about 6 miles that way. Okay. What you're gonna want to do... i think... Okay, here's the stop sign. Make a right. Matt, this can't be it. It looks... that's a fucking barn, is it not? Red-brick house, barn. It's not a barn. Matt. Let me check it out. Matt! You have the picture. That's the barn, right? That's the barn. Matt, what are you gonna do? You're gonna just drive up there? Yeah, I'm gonna fucking drive up there. I'm gonna pull her the fuck out of there. Matt, you really should think this through. What are you thinking? Shit. You guys just stay in the car, okay? Mya, you get in the driver's seat, all right? What do you think you're gonna do? I'm gonna grab her, if she's in there, and get her the fuck out of there. What if she's not? Then we keep fucking looking. If she's not, I'm going to the fucking police. Get in the car! Get in the car! Get in the Van! Go, go, go! Come on! Come here! God damn it! Come on, Matt, go! Fuck! With a fucking shotgun? Fuck! So, you got an ex-girlfriend that you start fucking again, finds out you're cheating. She's dead. Your best buddy cameraman finds out you're taking money out of the production budget. He's dead. And then the wannabe porn star, who you're the last one to be seen with... She might be dead. And it's all Scott Roberts' fault? I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. Did you guys ever look up Scott Roberts? Go, go! Shit, shit! What are you doing?! It's not me! It's the fucking car! God fucking damn it. Why the fuck is this happening?! Matt, please tell me you know what you're doing in there. Well? Hello? How the fuck should I know? Okay, I'm calling the cops. We're fucking dead. You getting anything? Can't get a signal. Shit. Two bars. Is it ringing? Shh! Hello, hello. Yes. We're... we just got shot at. Our car is broken down. We need help. Hello? What happened? What happened? Hello? Give me your phone. Here, here, here. Shit. There's a car down there. I'm gonna go flag him down. Mya, Mya, wait. No. That's him. That's the guy, that's the guy. Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down. Here, I gotcha. Come on. Come on. Let's stay away from the road. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. I got your back. Let's see if we can get inside. Geez. What is he doing? He's got a shotgun. All right, let's go. All right, let's just hurry up and get out of here. Watch out. Just watch where you're walking. What is that smell? Watch out. Watch your step, watch your step. Step up. Breakers. Two steps down. This looks like... this looks like the place. This is where they shot that snuff film. I think that's blood. No way. No way that's coming off. Damn it, Robbie. I'm sorry. Watch where you're fucking going, man. Sorry. Let's get the fuck out of here. My god. God. That's Alyssa's shirt. Geez. Get up. We got to get out of here. Get up. We have to go. Come on! Matt, come on. We got to get out. Come on! We got to get out of here, man. Robbie. You son of a bitch! Police radio chatter, I'm gonna ask you one more question, Matt. And you answer it if you want. Do you believe in ghosts? What? You know, ghosts, dead people among us, shit like that. Yeah, sure. Why not? I want to show you something. This is a death certificate. I want you to read the name on that certificate and I want you to read it out loud so you can hear yourself. Read it, Matt. What's it say? Scott Roberts. What's the death date? November 11, 1976. That was a long time ago, Matt. I know it was you. I can see it in your eyes right now. Maybe you don't even know what you did. Maybe you never will. You go ahead and keep that. I got a copy. Hey, it's Alyssa. I'm not here right now, but leave me a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, Alyssa. It's Matt. You know that thing we talked about with Mya... Everything's smoothed over now. There's no more tension. I worked everything out, so when you get a second, give me a call back, okay? I really miss you. I want to see you.
