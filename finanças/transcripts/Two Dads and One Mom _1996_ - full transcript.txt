Money? Hey! Save me Kyeong Tae! Kyeong Tae!! Don't move! You're under arrest. Kyeong Tae! Save me...! Nice... Hey! Why are you hissing at me?! Something seems like a bad omen. That was some unlucky dream... Hey, I've been having strange dreams ever since the sperm donation. Hey! Didn't you tell us not to drink from the bottle because it's unhygienic?! I had a really scary dream, that's why. What sort of dream? What dream? A huge tiger pounced on me. Really?! I dreamt that I was being strangled by snakes and I couldn't breathe. Mine was a bear. Why would we be having such dreams? Are we even having nightmares together now? Wait a minute! This dream seems to be a good omen. Is the publisher signing a contract with me today? No, no, no... Lottery! It's lottery! I think so too. - Let's go buy lottery tickets! - Let's go buy lottery tickets! Congratulations, you're pregnant. - Really?! - Really?! Yes. The fetus is in a very good position. Congratulations. Thank you! Thank you, Doctor! Don't thank me, both of you did all the hard work. Well, it has been hard on her indeed. - Thank you, doctor! - Na Yeong... Careful, careful, careful... You mustn't fall. Be careful... be careful... Be careful when you sit down. Careful... Sit here? Careful, careful...! Just stay here. Be more careful. Stand up carefully. Here we go...! Didn't I tell you to be careful?! You gave me a bigger fright than the toy did, honey! Oh right! The baby must've been frightened. I'm sorry. Go lie down over there. Be careful...! Be careful! Be careful... Why is that thing here? - Alright! - This feels good! You should have stayed in hospital for observation for a few days, just for our peace of mind. No, I like being home. Even so... the doctor said that the first month is very crucial. Must always be calm and stable. That's right, I've also heard that the first month is the most dangerous time. Just have to be more careful at home. But honey, don't you have to go to work? No, I've already called to say that I can't go to work today. Haven't you been really busy with work lately? I'll take this opportunity to have a few days off. Really? You can really do that? Of course! We went through so much trouble having this child, this is the minimum I should be able to do. Want to listen to some music? Music? Alright, let's have some music. Alright. Let's have a look. Hwasung Electronics. 45,700... 4 5 45,790 Isn't this amazing? Am I really going to strike lottery?! I'll trust you this once. Hwasung Electronics' price has shot up. I've said that the price will go up, didn't I? If I win, I will never draw comics again. I'll just set up a publishing company! Seong Min, Seong Min, Seong Min! You've called at the right time. Come over here today, I'll buy you a lottery ticket. I had this really wonderful dream... What? Na Yeong is pregnant?! Yes, we finally succeeded in having a child. Wow, well done! Congratulations. Is it a boy or a girl? We still don't know yet. Is there anything that Na Yeong would like to eat? I'll bring it with me when I go over. Not too expensive though. No, the embryo has only been implanted for a few days. Really?! Congrat... Congratulations dude!! Hey! Should we have a celebration tonight? No. How can I leave the mother of my child alone at home? Hey dude, just bring Na Yeong with you! She's the star today! Hey dude!! How can she drink when she's pregnant? Oh yes, yes... She shouldn't be drinking. Anyway, congratulations! Really, congrats, dude! This dude! My friend just got pregnant. Congratulations Inspector Na! I am Inspector Na-Hwang. Well done. Wait a minute. So that was a baby dream that we had? It was a baby dream... baby dream! So what if it's just a baby dream? Seong Min is elated. I'll just have to make money by working. Honey, I want some water. Water? Water. Honey, give me the remote control. Remote control? Here. Honey, my back is aching! Your back? This feels good. Feels good, doesn't it? Honey. Nothing, keep massaging. Honey... What is it again? Nothing. Stop playing around! Wait! You're scaring the baby. Oh yes, that's right! I must've scared the baby. Are you really happy? You seem happier than I am. Of course! It's great. What's there to be happy about? Wasn't it really hard on you when I wanted a child? No. As long as you're happy, I'll be happy. Seong Min, who do you want our baby to resemble? I hope our baby will take after you. Me?! The baby better not look like me! It has to take after you. No, if it's a son then he should take after you. And if it's a daughter, then she can take after me. No, no... Whether it's a boy or a girl, it has to resemble the beautiful mother. Oh, it fell again. No, no... Baby, you have to take after half of daddy and half of mommy, understand? Where's Sergeant Kim? I'll have some al-tang (fish egg stew) too. Al-tang for me too. Al-tang for me too! I want ramyun (noodles) and kimbap (rice rolls) - What's wrong? - Why don't you order al-tang? Al-tang soup costs 8,000 won per bowl. That's so expensive! Why should I eat that? Smells wonderful! No, no... There's too much oil fume over here, it's not good for you. It's alright. Wow, my honey sure knows how to make omelet. Of course! I was assigned to kitchen duty when I was in the army. Oil is spurting out of the pan, so go and sit over there. Alright. This is like a dream. But is there really something in here? Baby, are you in there? It's so unreal. This baby is a gift from heaven. A gift from heaven? Yeah, without heaven, we wouldn't have this gift. Shall we name it Ha Seon? Heaven's (ha neul) gift (seon mul). Ha Seon. What do you think? Ha Seon? Ha Seon! Jung Ha Seon! We still don't know if it's a boy or a girl? But that sounds like a girl's name. It sounds okay as a boy's name too. Listen... Ha Seon! Jeong Ha Seon! Honey, go buy your friends a few rounds of drinks tonight. It doesn't matter, we see one another all the time. No, you haven't been able to go drinking because of me. Tell your friends that I'm really sorry. And ask them to come to our place for poker, I will play a good host, alright? My beautiful wife! But we cannot play poker. It's bad for the baby's pre-natal education. No, we're about to have a baby, so you need to earn some diaper money. Is that so? Honey, it's burning. Oh bummer! Cheers! Congratulations on becoming a dad! All the side dishes are on the house today. Thank you, Ahjussi! Enjoy your drinks! But why name the child Ha Seon? What's Ha Seon? Name it Seong! Jeong Seong. That sounds really sincere (jeong seong) too! You think naming a child is a joke? Use Shin! Jeong Shin. Let it keep its spirits (jeong shin) up every day. What kind of name is that?! Call it Gi Jeok (miracle)! Gi Jeok. Its birth is like a miracle, so name the baby Jeong Gi Jeok. What a nice name, Jeong Gi Jeok! Anyway, thank you all! It's all because of you guys. Drink up! Of course it's because of us! Because of us? Yeah, what you just said sounds really weird. Because of us? What's wrong? What? What... do you mean by that? Well... I'm just saying it! What else can it mean?! Drink up, drink up! Wait, wait! Tell me, it's not that, is it? What? The sperm. You didn't use ours, did you? - No. - Really? Of course! It's my child... You'll be dead and gone if you lie to us. I already said it's not, you rascal... But this is a little strange... Aren't you suffering from azoospermia? How did you succeed this time? Well, well! That's why it's a miracle! A miracle! Are you sure you didn't use mine? No! Am I a person who will play around with such an issue? Trust me. Just trust me. I'll trust you then. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. No, this won't do. Seong Min, you have to swear to us right now that you are not lying. Alright, I swear that I am most definitely not lying. Happy? Alright then. Dude... Well, who is Seong Min anyway? The seong and min in trust (seong min)! Ah... so Seong Min stands for the seong and min in trust. I didn't know that. Hey! Anyway, congratulations again! Thank you! I'm about to become an uncle, so I'd better keep my spirits up! Hey, how come we're happier than he is? Drink up, cheers! Where are you? It's so noisy. Our secret meeting place! Did you have a lot to drink? A little! Na Yeong, Seong Min is really happy. Congratulations! Thank you. Na Yeong, do you know that we even had baby dreams? Really?! Na Yeong, Na Yeong! There were tiger, bear and snakes. It will grow up to be an outstanding fella! - It's got to be a son! A son! - I prefer daughter. Na Yeong, now that you're going to have a child, you should live happily ever after with Seong Min. And Seong Min will be home very late tonight! - He can't go! - Congratulations! Honey! I will be home really, really late tonight! Don't worry, just pick the expensive one. Seong Min! Seong Min's about to become a dad! I'm alright! I'm about to be a father! No problem! But... But where should we go for round 2? Round 2? Where? Follow me! What are you doing? I want to upload it to the internet. This is what you wore to get me pregnant. What do you think of this, Seong Min? Wow! My Na Yeong is gorgeous! - Thank you. - Looks good! Tada! Cute, isn't it? - It's so cute! - What if it's a boy? How do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl? Just have a girl then! [Insurance Voucher] What is this? - Insurance... -What are you doing? How much money is he earning now? How can he afford the monthly installment? Are you paying for it? We all are. Are you out of your mind?! Is this how you do it? Like this, right? - Do I talk into this? - Hurry up and say something. Seong Min, you'll frighten it. Softly. I'm your daddy. I'm your mommy. Seriously... No, please go out. The air is really bad in here. Is that all that you have been doing? What do you mean by "all that I've been doing"? I'll show you when I'm finished, so just go wait for me outside. Hello? What can I do for you, Father? Why do you have to go on a business trip all of a sudden? I might not be able to make it back if the matter's delayed. Your morning sickness has been pretty serious, I feel so bad leaving you alone at home. You'll be gone for a while, won't you? No, I'll try to make it back today. But your appetite hasn't been too good either, look how sunken your face is. It hurts me to see you like this. Do you know how tough it is to be a mother? Go in quickly, it's cold out here. It's alright, I'll watch you leave first. Alright. Be careful! Buy me something yummy on your way back! Alright! I'll call you! Why is it so cold in here? The heater's broken again? Have you called AS Repairs? They said they can only come out tomorrow. Is it very cold? No, it's okay. I put on a sweater. No, that won't do. Go to Kwang Hee's house. I don't want to. Why do I want to go to a house full of guys for? You're going to be even colder tonight! Our house is already very cold during the day because we don't even get sunlight. I'll just wrap the feather-down jacket around me when I sleep tonight. You're catching a cold already. You can't take medications when you have a cold because you're pregnant. No, this won't do. I'll give them a call, so go over to Kwang Hee's house right now. Alright. Damn...! Who asked you to leave your phone switched on when we are keeping watch? Seong Min? I'll give you a call later. Hey, hey, hey! He's out! Go get him! Seong Min... Seong...! Damn it! Rascal...! Are you very busy? N...No. You must be sick of reporting here every day. No, it's not that. I've heard of your capability. Your superiors are very happy with your performance. Yes. So I've been thinking about that investment scheme which you'd mentioned to me. Pardon? We won't invest the full sum, let's start with one-third of the share and give it a try. That's a very good idea. I will try my best for you, sir. This fellow is a nutcase. Huh? There's a silly man in Australia who got himself into trouble after donating his sperm. How can anyone donate their sperm to some woman whom they don't even know? Crazy fool! What a brainless fellow! What do you think of this issue?! Huh...? I'm talking about sperm donation. Ah... yes, yes... Those fellows are crazy! Bunch of rascals... why isn't anyone answering their phone? Rascals... You're all going to get it from me. This is weird! Kwang Hee usually stays home during the day. Where did he go? Eh? Oppa? Yes, Oppa misses you too! Of course! Should we meet today? Oppa knows of a place with a very nice ambience. Oppa has another call coming through. I have to answer it so just hold on for a second. Editor. Since you have so much time for dating, why don't you use it to research on your work? Your proposal has been rejected again, Mr. Choi. Really? I want to help you too, but threats don't work very well lately. I see... What are these? These are works from the would-be comic artists, how can I find time to finish all of them? Mr. Choi, you're becoming more handsome by the day. What's wrong? Don't you like me sitting next to you? No! Aren't you already sitting next to me? I told you that I'm turning 40, didn't I? I'm still a virgin, so why are you looking down on me? I haven't looked down on you, noonim. Noonim... oh my... I'm having a headache. There's no need to be so formal with me. How long have we known each other? But I'm speaking to an elder... Don't remind me about my age. Just relax, don't be so formal. You're not so stiff and formal towards other women, right? But how can I... how can I speak informally to an editor? That's it, that's it. This is exactly how you should talk to me. You're better than the other men. Oh, good... I've not seen anyone who uses such elaborate book cover succeed. This is mine. I drew a new one, as an opportunity to make a fresh start. Really? I'll take a good look. Mr. Choi, look at me. Oh my, how can someone be so cute like you are? Don't you know that I'm busy right now? I'll take my leave now, noonim! Come...come in, Na Yeong. Please take a seat. Sorry to bother you when you're so busy... Do you have a cold? I should have come home earlier if I had known! Why didn't you call me earlier? It's okay, I'm fine! No, this won't do. Cover yourself with this. Kyeong Tae... Wh...what's wrong, Na Yeong? I'm sorry, but... Can you please wash your feet? I can't stand the smell... Feet...? I've been chasing criminals today... The smell is a little... What smell? It really does smell. Um, Na Yeong... Is there something that you would like to eat? I'll ask them to buy it if there's anything you feel like eating... This is not good... Did she catch a cold? - Bye. - Alright, alright... Mom. Mom... What happens if a pregnant woman catches a cold? Why are you asking this all of a sudden? I'm asking you what to do if a pregnant woman catches a cold. She can't take cold medicine, can she? Definitely not! I didn't know anything when I was pregnant with you, so I ate some cold medicine... The reason why your brain doesn't function too well is all because of the cold medicine. Have you gotten yourself into some sort of trouble?! No! It's for Seong Min's wife, Na Yeong. Na Yeong has caught a cold and I don't know what to do. Why are you bothering yourself with Seong Min's wife? Well, I have a reason for it. Then go get a pear and empty the core. Fill it with honey, put it in a plate and steam it till the juice comes out. Let her drink the juice. Why must you give such complicated instruction all in one go? Just buy a really huge pear. Alright, I know. Boy, what exactly are you doing? What? Seong Min is going to have a child now, what about you?! Don't worry, I'm about to have one too. What? How can you have children when you're not even married? No... no! I mean I want to get married soon. Then do you want to go match-making? Match-making? Alright, I'll do it. Okay! Then I'll let you know after I've made the arrangements. Alright. Bye, Mom! Bye, bye! I know. I'll buy a good one. I'll buy the most expensive one. Pear 850 Won each Pear 1600 Won each Expensive doesn't necessarily mean better. - Are you done choosing them? - Yeah. Kids, go play over there. - What are you kids doing? - Hey, hey! What the hell?! So noisy! Kids are little demons! Seong Min's kid will definitely be like that too! Yeah, that's true. We won't be able to play poker with him once he has a kid. Pity... that was a good source of income. I wouldn't go to his house even if I'm invited. Kids crying and poop lying all over the place, imagine how annoying that would be. What more, I'll have to say that the kid is cute, if not, the child's parents won't be happy! How tiring is that? Just say that the kid is cute then. It doesn't cost money, what's so difficult about that? Well, how can I say that it's cute when it's obviously not?! I can tell all sorts of lies except that. They think that they're kings because they have children? Why are they like that? Are their children really that cute?! You think your dog is cute too. That's because it's a dog. Hey, my Milk doesn't make noise and is very obedient. Have you seen milk's poop? It's just like little nuts. Kyeong Tae thought those were nuts too and ate it... Hey! I'm still talking, how can you leave me there talking to myself?! What about the skin? Do you have to peel it? Skin? I don't know. Then just peel half of it. Do you know how expensive a pear is? Make sure you peel it thinly. Seriously! You do it then! I don't know, I'll leave it to you guys. Give it to me, I'll peel it. What are you doing? Go get some honey. It's just a cold, isn't it? Why are we making so much fuss? High-end resources like us. Why are you complaining so much? Just go and do your own stuff. Go! Alright, alright... seriously... Hey, do we really have to add honey? It's not like that. Hey! - Hey, hey! - What are you doing?! Do you know how expensive a pear is? I'm asking you to peel the skin... I'll do it. Let me do it. Honestly... How is it, Na Yeong? Does it work? She's still drinking, how can there be any effect yet? It's too sweet. Do you know how much trouble we went through trying to make it? We spent a lot of money too. Oh my! Are you trying to show off just because you made that? What about all the food that I've made for you so far? Hey! See? I told you no good will come out of being nice to her. To tell the truth, do you know how much money I've spent to feed all of you? Feed us? Well it's equivalent to feeding all of you. Am I wrong? We're not beggars. What do you mean by feeding us? That's enough. Those food doesn't even taste good. I'm just saving you face by eating them. What did you say?! You should thank me for enjoying the food. Hey, didn't you have to make yourself eat those food too? Well, Na Yeong, your culinary skill is a little... average. Oh... the pregnant lady's blood pressure is about to rise. Have I merely been feeding you guys? You were doing your laundry at our place too, using our water and electricity. Have you ever bought me any washing powder? Seong Min has obviously given you instructions to treat me well today. Are you really going to behave like this? I will tell Seong Min all about it! No, no! We will definitely treat you well. Hey, what are you guys doing? Is there anything you feel like eating, Na Yeong? Just let us know. Since you're here for a visit, we'll get you whatever you want. But Soo Hyeon doesn't seem to welcome me. No, please let us know. Really? Of course. Then... I'll have chokpal (pig's trotter) which is good for anemia... What are you doing? Jot it down quickly! I feel like eating dakpal (chicken feet) all of a sudden. And dakpal! Dakpal? Soondae too. Beondaeggi (silkworm larvae)! Beondaeggi?! Just those. Where are we supposed to get those in the middle of the night? Well, if you want a chance to play with my baby, you'll have to pay for the ticket in advance, don't you? Auntie, auntie! Excuse... excuse me! Auntie! Where's your cell phone? Call them. Excuse me! High-end resources like us are doing such things... Thanks auntie! Hey! Why are you so useless? Look what you've gotten us into?! What did I do? It's all because he couldn't get along with Na Yeong! Why are you pushing the blame to me? That smell! Take it away from me! The smell will linger in the car now. What smell? It looks delicious. No way. Go put it in the boot. Hey dude, how can you leave food in the boot? Hurry up and go. Where are we going now? Where can we find dakpal? We have to go to Namdaemun. Hey! I'm not going. Do you know how much fuel that will waste? - This is all your fault!! - This is all your fault!! Take this as a good lesson. All of you have been free-loading from us so far. What? My cooking is average? Think you can get away by just shoving a pear to me? In your dreams. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Oops! You think it's so easy to be an uncle? Why hasn't Seong Min called? He's not done with his business yet? My son-in-law... You are the son-in-law of this old man? No. Son-in-law! Where do you think you're going? How can you leave like that? Please help me! Are you the son-in-law or not? Yes, I am. - Have you brought the money? - Yes. - Hurry up and take it out! - Here, here... What? Is that all?! I'll pay the rest from my salary every month... What? Hey there! There's no one in this area who hasn't been scammed by your father-in-law! If you don't return my money now, I'll have you thrown in jail! When have I said that I wasn't going to return the money? What? Please stop doing that. I'm glad you're enjoying the food, Na Yeong. I feel a sense of achievement too. Enjoy your food and have a healthy baby. Alright. Don't just watch me eat. Let's eat together. It's really delicious. I feel bad eating all of it by myself. Here! We bought it for you, Na Yeong. Just eat it by yourself. Don't stand on ceremony, have some! What kind of men are you? You don't even have the guts to eat these. You have no idea how delicious this is, yet you're staring at me like I'm an alien. Not an alien, but a barbarian. Forget it if you don't want any. Why aren't you asking me? Ah! You want some too, Kyeong Tae? Here! I'll watch your baby for you every day after you've given birth. Really? Of course! Soondae? Do you like beondaeggi? You're too much, Father. When are you ever going to stay out of trouble? Haven't you already given me 3 million won? Are you going to give me a lecture too? No. What kind of girl is my Na Yeong? Can't I even ask you for a little money? Other people... ...can get driven around by their sons-in-law because they have good daughters. Why are you saying this? To be honest, Na Yeong wasn't brought up by you. Na Yeong will kill me if she knows that I'm here to see you. Don't you want to know how Na Yeong is doing? Alright... how's Na Yeong? She's pregnant. Really? Then I'll go visit her one day. There's no need to! Not now. I'll let you know when she's given birth. Yeah? Alright. Make sure you treat her well now that she's pregnant! Father, didn't you ditch Na Yeong's mother when she was pregnant with Na Yeong? You can go now if there's nothing else. Do you have anywhere to go? There are many places waiting for me, don't worry. Then... For you. Why are you doing this...? I'm going now. Go. Father, I'm leaving! Alright, go! Go! Na Yeong, Oppa is going home now. There's a sudden storm in the southern area. The storm will persist with another 50mm of rain expected to arrive. There is a high pressure trough... What to do? We can't carry her into the room. Leave her here. Where's Na Yeong? She's fine. She just fell asleep. - She's asleep? - Yes. Has she been having morning sickness? Morning sickness? I haven't seen any morning sickness. She enjoyed her food very much. Really? Oh, and what about her cold? Dude, don't worry, her cold's fine, too. We'll look after Na Yeong and the baby, so don't worry. Alright, I know. Thanks! I'll be back soon! Alright. Hey, stop looking. Let's go in. [Road closed due to flash flooding. Please seek detour.] Soo Hyeon, what's our Seong Min going to do? Soo Hyeon, what's going to happen to our Seong Min? Poor Seong Min... Poor Seong Min... [Jeong Seong Min's tree] Scissors, paper, stone! Scissors, paper, stone! I win! Quick, quick! Change over! Quick! Get up here! Exam is the day after tomorrow! Day after tomorrow! Someone like you actually have such a good taste. How old are you already? You're carrying this photo with you all the time, no wonder you couldn't get a girlfriend! - Throw it away. - Hey! - Alcohol! - Hey! Hey! - Wait, wait! - Let him drink! - No, no! He'll finish it up! - Mind your own business! Dude! This is my girlfriend. Introduce yourselves! How are you? I'm so jealous!! - Monkey god! - Monkey god? What's wrong with you? - Is it not a pig demon? - Oh Yes, it's the pig demon. - Or is it the monk? - It's the pig demon! It just doesn't resemble the pig demon because I'm lying down. I won't do it anymore in future. They all seem very sad. Mommy's sad, and all the daddys too. That was supposed to be a poker day. But nobody had the mood to play poker that day. Here. Here is the key. Na Yeong... I think it's better that you stay over at our house tonight. No, I'm fine. All of you have gone to a lot of trouble lately. Hey! Why are you leaving for work so early? I'll make you some food, eat before you leave. What's wrong? What about the electromagnetic waves? Guess it doesn't work. There's other things around, why must he hit his head on the metal bar? What an unlucky bastard! What? Unlucky bastard? Yeah! There are so many other places. Unlucky?! Hey, hey! Do you think the dead man's friend will think like you?! Do you think the dead man's wife will think like that too?! Unlucky?! You said he's unlucky, you bastard! Let him go and calm down! I'm going out for a while. What's wrong with you, Mr. Choi? When are you submitting your drawings? I'm sorry, something came up. Something came up? How can you do that? You're not an amateur. A very, very good friend just passed away. I don't have the urge to draw. I'll do it soon. Which friend? Which friend? Oh gosh, liar... No... If you're not lying, then which friend is it? Tell me. Are you trying to lie to me again? You said your grandfather passed away the last time. How many times have you done this already? This is not the first or second time that you're lying to me. This is real. It's real! Why wouldn't you believe me when I'm telling the truth?! You're here. How can something like this happen? Yeah... Don't be discouraged. Ahjussi, do you want this? Aren't these cacti? But why are you giving it to me? Please take it. Alright. Thank you. Don't you have to go to work? It's alright. We still have to do what we have to do. Can't go on like this. Yeah. Have you... visited Na Yeong yet? No. We should go check on her. Yes, we have to. Mom, I'm hungry. I want some food! I keep reminding her but how come she doesn't know it? She still must be really sad. Na Yeong. I haven't tidied up the place. These clothes have to be thrown away, and I have to pack the luggage too... I don't know where to start... - All these clothes have to be thrown away... - Na Yeong. Sit down. I have to apply for the death certificate too. I heard that there will be a fine if it's not done. I still have to go to the bank to cancel Seong Min's savings account, and his handphone too... There's so many things I have to do. But I don't know where to start? We'll do it all. Na Yeong, we'll do everything for you. Have you eaten? You have to eat something, you can't go on like this. You're right. I shouldn't be like this. I have to think of my baby, so I can't be like this. It's a gift from heaven. That's right, you can't go on like this. You have to make yourself eat even if you don't feel like it. Kwang Hee spent a lot of time figuring out how to make this so it should be good. It's delicious. Have some water. Eat well so you can get your energy back. Hey, how can you bring all these here? I can't bring them over to Na Yeong. She has no use for them anyway, just pass it to her next time when you get a chance. Did we take this when we were in college? It's during our sophomore years, when I was taking my Chartered Accountant exams. Why do I look like a country bumpkin with that hairstyle? Hey, you still look like a country bumpkin now, dude. Those were the days... I think he drew the house that he wanted to live in with the baby. That's really cool. Yeah... There's a garden too. What is this? For my dearest baby, Ha Seon Daddy Tada! Hello Ha Seon! This is daddy. Daddy has something to show you today. Over here... What you are looking at over here are the toys that Ha Seon would be playing after you're born. Daddy made it for you with my own hands. Even though this is still unfinished and looks roughly made, it is a rocking horse for Ha Seon. And over here is a baby crib that my dear Ha Seon would be sleeping in. Pretty, isn't it? Alright... Ha Seon... When my Ha Seon sees this, Daddy would be quite old by then. You are a gift that God has given Daddy and Mommy as a blessing for our love. Hey!! Dudes... Okay! I know! Dudes... We'll call it a day because your uncles are causing trouble outside. Alright, it's fine now. Those fellow only just left. Oh yes, Daddy can call them dudes, but you must address them as uncle. You will understand it when you're born, these uncles are really, really close to Daddy. When Ha Seon grows up and become an outstanding person, you have to treat those uncles just as well as when you're treating Daddy. Those uncles are just the same as daddy. They are people that Daddy is really thankful for. Those uncles have given Mommy and Daddy a very special present. Without those uncles, our Ha Seon would not come into this world. Of course, those uncles don't know about it. Those uncles have given Mommy and Daddy a very special present. Without those uncles, our Ha Seon would not come into this world.

Are you asking me to abort the child?! I will really do my best to bring the child up properly. Fighting! I have to make a trip to the gallery today for the painting. Wonderful! That's a very good piece of work. Na Yeong! Na Yeong! Alright, let's give it a try. What should a 6-month pregnant woman eat? This has been sliced too thick. What a pity! Of course!
