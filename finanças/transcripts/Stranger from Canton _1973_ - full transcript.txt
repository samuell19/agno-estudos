TOEI COMPANY LTD Presents Letter of challenge. ﻿The recent karate ﻿match was too lenient. ﻿Kiba Naoto, with Ki-ryu, won ﻿the number one title in it. ﻿We, the Kikoku-ryu, find it ﻿exceedingly ridiculous. ﻿As such, we would ﻿like an actual combat ﻿with the Ki-ryu school, and ﻿request a duel with you. ﻿Time: October 13th ﻿at 9:00 p.m. ﻿Place: Chiijagaike ﻿From Kikoku-ryu's ﻿Sameya Ikkan ﻿To Tesshin-kai's ﻿Daito Tetsugen ﻿Where is Kiba Naoto? ﻿He took Sensei's place. ﻿No. Duels aren't allowed ﻿in Tesshin-kai's karate school. ﻿Stop him! ﻿BODYGUARD KIBA HISSATSU SANKAKU TOBI (Karate Killer) ﻿Written by: ﻿NAKANISHI Ryuzo ﻿Produced By: ﻿FUJITA Baku ﻿Brother! ﻿Maki! ﻿Cast ﻿CHIBA Shinichi ﻿WATASE Tsunehiko ﻿SHIHOMI Etsuko ﻿Maki! ﻿Special Appearance: ﻿OYAMA Masutatsu ﻿Directed by: ﻿TAKAMORI Ryuichi Maki! ﻿Maki...! ﻿KARATE DUEL INCIDENT ﻿KIBA NAOTO TURNS ﻿HIMSELF IN ﻿REJECTS LEGAL HELP ﻿JAIL SENTENCE ﻿TESSHIN-KAI-KARATE ﻿FACES CRISIS ﻿KIBA NAOTO LEAVES ﻿KARATE SCHOOL ﻿Don't interfere!

I don't know how ﻿she gets it through, too. ﻿Come on, eat. ﻿Who asked you? ﻿What'? Who told you to make ﻿me eat this? ﻿What a weird guy. ﻿You don't want any? ﻿I see. I won't force ﻿you to eat it. ﻿It's especially good today. ﻿Hey... that stance. ﻿What style is that? ﻿My own style. ﻿That's like an eel. I want more. ﻿Mr. Kiba. ﻿Congratulations, ﻿Mr. Kiba Naoto. ﻿Would you like a ride? ﻿Too bad your sister ﻿can't come to get you. ﻿Did you like the lunches? ﻿Were those from you? ﻿Thanks to you, I was ﻿well-fed. ﻿How do you know my sister? I'm her friend. She's doing good. ﻿I see... Thanks. Come ﻿here tonight. ﻿NIGHTCLUB PLAZA ﻿Hey! ﻿Stop over. You can ﻿have beer on the house. ﻿I'm hungry right now. ﻿We have food, too! ﻿There's food? ﻿We just opened, so I'll ﻿give you food as service. ﻿My name is Yoko. ﻿This is an extra service. ﻿Here, have some, too. ﻿Her name is Mari. Don't ﻿set your eyes on her. ﻿She doesn't talk much. ﻿Listen to her. She's ﻿trying her best. ﻿Hey you, drink more. ﻿-Bring more beer! ﻿-I've had enough. ﻿-Leaving already? - How much? ﻿-Bring his bill. ﻿-That'll be 50,000 yen. ﻿50,000 yen? For this? ﻿I don't have that much. ﻿Sir, let's not joke here. ﻿Are you trying to eat ﻿and drink for free? ﻿I don't mean to. ﻿This is all I have. ﻿Hey you, did you just ﻿get out of prison? ﻿That doesn't scare us. ﻿We can call guys ﻿to take care of you. ﻿In that case, call them. ﻿Damn you. ﻿Wait. ﻿Isn't this yours? ﻿I found it there. ﻿I'm going to take ﻿the money from here. ﻿Leave quickly. ﻿NIGHTCLUB PLAZA ﻿Your attire. ﻿Hey! ﻿Give me a beer. ﻿Throw him out! ﻿Get him! ﻿Stop! ﻿Tatsumi, don't worry. ﻿He's here to see me. ﻿What? ﻿Oh, it's you! ﻿Follow me. ﻿That's Kiba. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Let me introduce you ﻿to Tatsumi, my old buddy. ﻿I have my tough ﻿men in the club. ﻿We don't need ﻿any bodyguard. ﻿What's the big deal? ﻿I wanted a personal ﻿bodyguard for myself. ﻿Is that right? Am I ﻿becoming a nuisance? ﻿Don't take it wrong. ﻿Your men can come ﻿to hang out as always. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿You don't like it? ﻿Want to try to kick ﻿him out then? ﻿With your tough men. ﻿From Tesshin-kai? ﻿From Kikoku-ryu? ﻿Stop it! ﻿I know what you're ﻿up to now. ﻿I'll have Karasaki ﻿settle this matter. ﻿Fine. ﻿This is how it should be. ﻿You've proven useful. ﻿I don't plan to work ﻿for you. What? ﻿That's what I'd like ﻿to say, ﻿but hearing they're from Kikoku-ryu changed my mind. ﻿My services aren't cheap. ﻿I'd like a deposit ﻿of five million yen. ﻿Fine. ﻿Be careful of Tatsumi. ﻿He's not the type ﻿to drop the matter. ﻿He uses those men as ﻿bodyguards to cling ﻿to the president. ﻿Aren't they buddies? ﻿That was long ago. ﻿The president wanted ﻿to cut ties with them. ﻿You're the bodyguard ﻿for that. ﻿Internal conflict? ﻿They'll clash with the ﻿president soon enough. ﻿You'll be the target. ﻿It's your chance to ﻿show your strength. ﻿I have to earn my keep. You would put up a good fight. ﻿I love tough men. ﻿Mika. It's wearing out. Hurry. ﻿Stop acting like my husband. ﻿Once you lose popularity, ﻿you are fired. ﻿I get it, Madam. - Can I sit here? ﻿-Sure. ﻿Any profitable jobs? ﻿You're lucky that ﻿you are strong. ﻿But you can't play ﻿the drum, can you? ﻿The one to grasp the ﻿money is the winner. ﻿Things will work ﻿itself out, won't it? ﻿If I stay here, ﻿I can somehow earn money. ﻿It's not a decent place. ﻿The taste of the food ﻿is the same everywhere. ﻿Hey. ﻿Take care of her. ﻿Stop it! I'll return the money, so leave. ﻿Just a little. ﻿No! ﻿Help! ﻿I want to see the Manager! ﻿What happened? ﻿He wanted me ﻿to dress up weird. ﻿You’re to be mute in ﻿front of the customers. ﻿But he wanted me to... ﻿Just do as you're told! ﻿Yes. ﻿Hey, Karasuda! ﻿Bet 1 million yen ﻿on Race 9. ﻿Yes. ﻿Akamatsu hired a karate ﻿trained bodyguard? ﻿I know what he's up to. ﻿He wants to sever ties ﻿with us and rise alone. ﻿From before, you were ﻿the brains, I was the ﻿strength, and he handled ﻿all the finances. ﻿That's how the three ﻿of us got along. He's trying to ruin that relationship. ﻿I hope you weren't eyeing ﻿Akamatsu's nightclub. ﻿What? He's the type who ﻿reads into the future. ﻿If he has to pay ﻿3 million yen a month to you, ﻿he'd fear the future ﻿and hire a bodyguard. ﻿Is that what he told you? ﻿I can figure that much. ﻿Tatsumi, let me make ﻿this clear to you... ﻿I won't allow you to ﻿clash with Akamatsu. ﻿If any one of us should ﻿leave the group, ﻿we will all be destroyed. ﻿That is why we made ﻿that promise back then. ﻿Tatsumi, do you hear me? ﻿If we should split up and ﻿our secret goes out... ﻿You won't get away ﻿with it either. ﻿I know that! ﻿As long as you know. ﻿I'll talk to Akamatsu, too. ﻿Why make a big deal ﻿over one karate master? ﻿Brother, is that you? ﻿That's right. When did you come out? Yesterday. I heard you are doing much better. ﻿I can be completely cured. Is that true? ﻿It was dangerous ﻿at one point, but... ﻿It must be because she ﻿was trained in karate. ﻿Is that right? I'm glad! ﻿Brother, I can do ﻿amazing things now. ﻿Nurse, where is the pillar? ﻿In the 9 o'clock position. ﻿What about his right hand? ﻿10 o'clock. ﻿I know the positions ﻿by the clock hand. You're right, it's amazing. ﻿Please take care of her. ﻿Brother, about the ﻿hospital bills... ﻿Silly. You don't have ﻿to worry about that. ﻿Tetsugen-Sensei paid it. ﻿Brother... ﻿Maki... ﻿Don't think about anything. ﻿Do you understand? ﻿Maki! 3 o'clock! ﻿You got me! ﻿I'm next. ﻿What did you come for? ﻿Where's the girl named ﻿Mari from yesterday? ﻿She's not here. Leave. I see. I came to return this to her. ﻿Give her my regards then. ﻿That ex-con! ﻿It's loaded! Shall we ﻿keep it? ﻿The man from yesterday ﻿dropped this off. ﻿It looks like he's in ﻿love with you. ﻿Wait! Wait up! ﻿Thanks for yesterday. ﻿This is too much. It's all right. It's ﻿in appreciation. ﻿I didn't do it for that. ﻿Why did you come ﻿to return it? ﻿It's only natural to ﻿return what I borrowed. ﻿I didn't expect that ﻿from a customer there. ﻿What made you ﻿decide to lend it then? ﻿So there are people ﻿like you on the mainland. ﻿Mainland? ﻿I thought they couldn't ﻿be trusted. ﻿Are you from Okinawa? ﻿When did you come? ﻿Four years ago. Right ﻿after middle school. ﻿Don't you miss your ﻿parents? ﻿My mom was shot. ﻿So have you been ﻿with that bar for long? About a year. ﻿Maybe you should ﻿find another place. It's the same ﻿wherever you go. ﻿Money is money. ﻿Which prison were you in? ﻿You don't have to say. ﻿It's not an item of ﻿interest to a young woman. ﻿Are you alone, too? ﻿Yes, that's right. ﻿Did you find a job? ﻿Yes, I did. ﻿What is your job? ﻿It's nothing much. ﻿Maybe I'll go to listen to ﻿your singing again tonight. ﻿Tenshagu no Hana? ﻿Do you know that song? ﻿I have an Okinawan friend. ﻿I see... It's better that you don't come. ﻿It's like throwing ﻿your money away. ﻿Okay. I'll have you sing ﻿for me outside of work. ﻿You insist on letting ﻿Tatsumi go? ﻿That's right. ﻿We're not the same ﻿men as before. ﻿We are all independent ﻿with our own businesses. ﻿Just because Tatsumi is ﻿the only one struggling, ﻿I can't have him hanging ﻿on for old time's sake. ﻿Akamatsu, I hope you ﻿haven't forgotten our ﻿little secret from three ﻿years ago. ﻿Karasaki, I know you are ﻿trying to use that to bring ﻿Tatsumi back on board ﻿and keep me in control. But it won't work that way. ﻿What? ﻿Forget the old comradery! ﻿I'm going to do things ﻿my way from now. ﻿I see. So you're going to ﻿cut ties with me as well? ﻿I have no choice if you are ﻿going to stick to Tatsumi. ﻿But I have enough power ﻿to control Tatsumi now. ﻿Come in. ﻿Is this the man? ﻿That's right! ﻿Welcome. ﻿Welcome! ﻿I'm going to borrow her. ﻿Not her. ﻿Aren't you losing there? ﻿Hey! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿We'll give you a good ﻿experience with men. ﻿Get her! ﻿Bitch! ﻿What a bitch! ﻿So you came. This is pay- ﻿back from the other day. ﻿Akamatsu's bodyguard! ﻿You...! ﻿She's just a woman ﻿from Okinawa. ﻿Will you make love ﻿to her after this? ﻿Stop it! ﻿I'll spare you for now. ﻿Mari? ﻿You're one of them! ﻿Liar! ﻿Who are you? ﻿Where's the office? ﻿What do you want? ﻿Oh, it's you! ﻿How did you find me? ﻿Why are you here? Nanjo! You're back! ﻿So you're doing fine! ﻿I'm glad you stopped by. ﻿Let's celebrate your release. ﻿Hey, loosen up! ﻿Come in. ﻿President, you have a ﻿call from Mr. Akamatsu. ﻿Bring the phone here. ﻿This is Karasaki. ﻿What? Nanjo? ﻿I was shocked. He had ﻿two more years to go. ﻿I have him at my place. ﻿Come quickly. Please. ﻿Oh, it's you. How do you know Nanjo? ﻿We were in prison ﻿together. ﻿What about you? ﻿I took care of him before. ﻿Glad to hear that. ﻿If you weren't here, ﻿I'd have beaten him up. ﻿We haven't settled ﻿the score in prison yet. ﻿Listen. Don't give ﻿him any trouble. ﻿This is the 30 million yen ﻿that I promised you then. Please accept it. ﻿This measly sum isn't ﻿going to settle it. ﻿What was that?! ﻿So you suffered... I'll put ﻿that into consideration. ﻿How much do you want? ﻿You all made it successful ﻿with my share of the loot. ﻿So what of it? ﻿In other words, a fourth ﻿of what you're all worth. ﻿That's my fair share of it. ﻿Don't be ridiculous! ﻿We've been through a lot! ﻿That's an unreasonable ﻿demand! ﻿In my eyes, it's reasonable. ﻿Or I wouldn't have stayed ﻿in prison for three years. ﻿If I spill the beans now, ﻿who knows what'll happen. With that in mind, ﻿isn't that a cheap price? ﻿Decide by noon tomorrow. ﻿I knew you'd be coming. ﻿I was worried about you. ﻿Liar. ﻿How much are they ﻿paying you to kill me? ﻿I'm just a bodyguard. ﻿I'm out of it unless you ﻿cause trouble at the club. ﻿What makes you think ﻿they want you dead? You were given a warm ﻿welcome back there. ﻿You don't seem to trust ﻿them, do you? ﻿Is there any mainlander ﻿that is trustworthy? ﻿So you're from Okinawa. ﻿Wait. ﻿I'll return the favor ﻿from prison someday. ﻿But if you stand in my ﻿way, I won't hold back. ﻿Are you taking them on? ﻿It's none of your ﻿concern, Mr. Bodyguard. I want to know as ﻿the bodyguard. ﻿I have to work with you. That's all up to them. If they reply favorably, we won't clash. ﻿What are we going to do? ﻿Nanjo kept quiet for three ﻿years to blackmail us. ﻿Then you have no choice ﻿but to cough it up. ﻿What was that? ﻿He’s dead serious. If ﻿we don't pay, he'll talk. ﻿To keep him in control, ﻿we have to pull him in. ﻿Just this club alone is ﻿worth hundreds of millions. ﻿Even if you pay a fourth, ﻿you'll still have change. ﻿Give me a break! ﻿Why should I pay it all? ﻿Akamatsu, I thought ﻿you cut your ties with us. ﻿What? ﻿That's right! You are ﻿on your own, right? ﻿You don't need our help. ﻿Wait a minute, Karasaki! ﻿Tatsumi! ﻿I was wrong. ﻿Will you forget that and ﻿team up with me again? ﻿So you'll work under ﻿my orders like before? ﻿Yes, you are our boss. ﻿Tomorrow, huh. As ﻿for disposing Nanjo... ﻿It'll be your job. ﻿You're late. ﻿A man came to see ﻿you earlier. ﻿Is he another ex-con? ﻿You have no decent ﻿men coming to see you. ﻿He had a scar on his face. ﻿Where is the scar? ﻿Around here. ﻿Out of my way! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi... ﻿Takeshi... ﻿Takeshi...! ﻿Mari... ﻿Sorry to put you ﻿through hardships. ﻿I'll get a lump sum ﻿coming in soon. ﻿Then we can live ﻿together. ﻿Takeshi, are you ﻿still after them? ﻿Of course. ﻿That's what I lived for. ﻿That's why I bore it in ﻿prison for three years. ﻿I'll get them... and ﻿make them suffer dearly. ﻿I'll help you. ﻿They deserve to die. ﻿I'll kill them! ﻿Mari, did something ﻿happen? ﻿Did something happen ﻿with them? ﻿Why do you want ﻿to kill them? ﻿Tell me what happened! Tell me! ﻿Takeshi, I'll go with you. ﻿No. ﻿So you won't give me ﻿a cent of my share? ﻿That's right. Got ﻿a problem with that? ﻿No... if you don't ﻿mind my talking. ﻿I guess I have no choice. ﻿Thought you'd understand. ﻿Tatsumi. ﻿What?! ﻿I have personal ﻿business with you. ﻿You do? ﻿What's this about? ﻿Why are you after me? ﻿Nanjo! Nanjo! Stop it! ﻿Move. ﻿I'm on payroll. I have ﻿to earn my keep. ﻿Run away quickly! ﻿Do you want her ﻿killed? Go quickly! ﻿Don't get in our way. ﻿Move. ﻿I said, move. ﻿Come at me. All right. ﻿Eel. ﻿I wanted money ﻿to live with Mari. ﻿I jumped at the ﻿30 million yen share. ﻿The group had those ﻿three and a Korean. Come quickly! The money we stole was 420,000 USD. ﻿Karasaki exchanged that ﻿for Japanese yen, and ﻿was supposed to split it. ﻿They're late. ﻿They hired him to kill ﻿me for a million yen. ﻿That's what Kim said ﻿before he died. ﻿I went to jail for three ﻿years for killing him. ﻿Kim, the Korean, and I, an Okinawan, were used ﻿by those mainlanders. ﻿Are you set on doing it? ﻿Of course. If I don't ﻿crush those three men, ﻿my three years in ﻿jail would be in vain. ﻿You'll lose your life. ﻿I didn't quietly submit ﻿to them for nothing. Mari! ﻿He came to save me. ﻿Where are you off to? ﻿I'm a bodyguard. ﻿If you storm into the ﻿place, I'll kick you out! ﻿You are here to ﻿settle it for Nanjo? ﻿Isn't it best to pay ﻿him off as he wants? ﻿You're a bodyguard. ﻿I'm saying this for ﻿your own safety. ﻿He plans to die. ﻿If my hunch is right, ﻿you men will die. ﻿Or end up in prison. ﻿All right. We'll give ﻿Nanjo what he wants. ﻿Where is he now? ﻿I'll contact him. He plans to wring ﻿them for me. ﻿I can't only put him ﻿in danger. ﻿Wait! If you go now, ﻿they will target you. ﻿I know that, but I ﻿can't leave him alone. ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Don't come. ﻿What?! ﻿Nanjo is here? ﻿Is that true? ﻿Nanjo? ﻿We'll bury him. ﻿Mika! ﻿Mika! Give me drugs! ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿Mika, please! ﻿What a pest! ﻿They want to talk. ﻿Where's Kiba? ﻿I'll show you the way. - ﻿Mari! - Where's Takeshi? ﻿He went to look for you. ﻿What? ﻿Where's Kiba? ﻿Die! ﻿Die! ﻿What's wrong? ﻿We've got trouble. ﻿That man was taken! - N﻿anjo? - Takeshi? ﻿Nanjo! ﻿Takeshi! Nanjo! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Nanjo! - ﻿Takeshi! - Nanjo! ﻿Nanjo! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi! ﻿Takeshi...! ﻿Takeshi... ﻿It's your fault. ﻿If you hadn't got involved, ﻿I could've died with him. You couldn't possibly ﻿understand how I feel. ﻿Stay out of this! ﻿Maki! ﻿Brother! ﻿I heard you had ﻿a younger sister, ﻿so I decided to use ﻿her to control you. ﻿Mika... ﻿Wait! Please wait! ﻿I was wrong! ﻿Please forgive me! ﻿5 o'clock! ﻿Maki! ﻿3 o'clock! ﻿Brother! ﻿It's Mari. ﻿You loved her, didn't you? ﻿Don't be silly. ﻿I can see that. ﻿Why, you little...! THE END
