SMILE ENT and ISU VENTURE CAPITAL present ES PICTURES and INDIESTORY production LINGERING Ms. Han? This way, please. So, your mother passed away five years ago? Yes. You must have been surprised when we called you. Rather than that... My parents got divorced when I was young, so I haven't kept in touch with mom. And we have different fathers. Well, I see... We couldn't really find anyone to discuss where she should stay. We couldn't really find anyone to discuss where she should stay. Anyway, since you're her sister, we thought it's better for us lo check with you. I can't really take care of her. I'm living alone in a studio, and I need to get a job. Well, the temporary protection we provide is up toe 3 months. What about orphanage? Yes, but... Ji-yoo's case is a little hard to handle. Her psychological test implies that she could have been abused. She seems rather unexpressive while too imaginative. What's wrong with being imaginative? She tells lies. Actually, this type of child is not easily accepted at the orphanage. If she doesn't adapt well, she should move around. And lately, adoption Is quite hard due to disruption issues. You're saying she's defective. I'm just saying that's the situation. Oh, there you are, Ji-yoo. Come on ever here! Your sister ls here. Hey, sit tight and - fasten your seatbelt. Will you sit tight, won't you? Where are we going now? I told you already. We're going to auntie's. Who's auntie? She is mom's friend. Then, I'm gonna live there now? That's where you were born. Your hometown. Auntie will take good care of you. She's really nice. I should go home and wait for my dad. Your dad won't come back even If you do. - YOO-mi. - Auntie. Welcome. - Is that Ji-yoo? - Yes. Ji-yoo... JI-yoo! You've grown a lot. Let's get inside. I guess things will get better once I get a job. But for now, I can't really afford it... I'm sorry to ask for a favor like this, out of the blue. Don't be. I didn't feel comfortable sending her to that sloppy man. By the way, W's been along time. The last time I saw you was at her funeral, right? Right... That reminds me, Yoon-hee's death anniversary is coming up. My, time flies. Remember you and Sang-woo used to play house over there? You were so cute at that time. How Is Sang-woo doing? I heard he went to Australia. He's doing great. We had a long chat this morning. He keeps looking for me every other day. Hey! Don't touch it without permission! That's fine. That's okay, go ahead! Well, her memories must be flooding back too. That's still there. it used to be Yoon-hee's, so I can't throw it away. Sometimes, I recall the good old days. When she played that piano and we sat here listening to it. I think that was the happiest days of our lives. You're staying until the weekend, right”? Sorry, I've got things to do... But I've already prepared your room. I can get used to being with Ji-yoo only if she feels that way, too. JI-yoo! I told you not to wander around! I'll come back for the winter break. So you should stay here and look after mom. Yoo-mi! Yoo-mi, you gotta go home! - Yoo-mi! - All right! What's that? Her name is Bunny. Do you remember this room? - Don't you remember mom either? - No. Didn't you hear anything from your dad? Dad said she was a crazy bitch. Is that real? You must not come In here again, okay? Wow, it's such a big room! And a nice bathroom! This one's my bed. Take that one on that side. Hey, stop it there. You make me a promise. Do not go upstairs or go into other rooms. And don't go outside of this hotel. Why can't I go to all of them? There are many same-looking rooms, so you'll get lost. Then you can come find me! It's not hide-and-seek. Let's play hide-and-seek! I'm not playing! One... Two... Three... Four... One... Two... Three... Four... Gosh... Oh, come on... Excuse me. Haven't you seen a kid? I guess she came down here. How am I supposed to know where in the world she is'? Who knows...? Maybe she's trapped in a hole. Why are you running around? There's someone over there... Where? There's no one. You're... a liar, aren't you? No, I'm not! Yes, you are. If you keep lying, you'll go to hell. Gosh, I'm bored. You don't look like your mom at all. Hey, YOON Ji-yoo! You're eating well. Here, help yourself. That looks good on you! Why didn't you wanna wear it? Hey! Stay on the first floor! You remember there's an amusement park behind our place? You used to love It there. Why don't you take her there tomorrow? You're her family, though. Spend some quality time together. Okay. You're so pretty, by the way. Do you have a boyfriend? What? No... Why not? You must be popular. I'm not really into it. Marriage seems even worse. Right, girls these days tend to focus on career than men. Still, it's better to have a man If things don't work out. It's not that easy to get a rich old man, like you-know-who. If you mess with a wrong man, you'll end up as a ruined woman. Why don't you have a drink? No, thank you. You seem to have so many thoughts in your head... You gotta live a thoughtless life, or your thoughts will drive you mad. - Dammit... stop it. Okay. You re too wasted. Sober up, now! Is it okay to drink that much while working here? She's been stressed out a lot. Her own business has totally failed, so she got divorced and started working here. But fortunately, we decided to take a break for a month. A break? Even if we run the hotel now, we can't even offset maintenance cost. We're so busy in the peak season that we even hire part-timers, but in the off-season, no guests at all. Okay. Hey. What are you doing? This? My favorite hobby. Come closer. Pretty, isn't it? Yeah, but... It seems slightly fake. Does it?? It just looks pretty to me. It's sad to wither and die. Isn't it dead already? No way! It's all still alive I've got my own know-how. Take a look at them. Look how fresh they are! By the way, where's your dress? I'd be happy to see you wear them here, at least. Alright. Ma'am! Look who's here, Officer OH! What brought you here? I'm just stopping by. Who's this young lady, by the way? - She's my friend's daughter. - Oh... Here. They say it's good for your health. - You'd better have such functional food instead of pills. Thanks. Man, she never says hello. Does she own this place or what? Damn. You're leaving already? I just came to say hi. I'm quite busy too. Why? Something's going on? Well, there"s a woman missing from the neighborhood. A North Korean defector, so few people know her. Perhaps you could post it on the wall. - Isn't it another money issue? - No one knows. So you shouldn't go out until late at night, okay? You take care of yourself first. - Keep it up. - Nah, you don't have to... MISSING Hey, don't go too fast! Hey. You wanna take that ride? Sis, take a picture of me! She's so cute! Take her picture! Sweety, look at me! Look at me, here! What are you doing? You didn't even look into the camera. Who were you talking with? A lady. She said she liked me and wanted to play with me. Good for you What do you think? You like this place, huh? It's close to auntie's, SO you can come every day. What about you? - You have auntie. - I hate auntie. - You have auntie. - I hate auntie. T's just because - you're not used to her. Soon you'll be following her all the way, I bet. -- Come on, let's go fer lunch. We can come again later It gets prettier at night with all the glittering lights. Then let's play tag at the hotel. You should play it with other kids. - I hate other kids. - Why? They bully me. If anyone bullies you, just run away. Don't just get bullied - like an idiot. Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten! Who are you talking with? Ji-Yoo? Excuse me? JI-yoo! Crazy bitch... Pardon?' I wasn't talking to you. Oh, by the way... That child is gonna stay here? Yes. If I were you, I'll never bring my child here. Why? This place sucks, that's why all staffs left. I would have left long ago If it didn't pay me this much. So what's the reason? There's... ...something here that drives people crazy. That room... Room 405... Who's that? A new staff? Wait a minute, please! Do you know that? A lady who used to work here died in that room. She went crazy and hung herself. I don't really want to know. She seemed like a woman of misfortune. I heard she was a friend of my boss. Boss is not sane either, so she wouldn't have cut her slack. Those who pretend to be noble and nice, they get people slave away to death, until finally ditch them. You know, her body... They said it was so dreadful with her eyes popped out... I don't wanna hear it! Daughter of my boss's friend... Are you that lady's daughter? No wonder you see things since you're always so drunk! And I'm not her daughter! Stop that bullshit! JI-yoo! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Look at this... Look at this! I knew It would be like this here... I'll completely wreck this place! I told you not to go into that room. What were you doing there? Why did you rip off Bunny's head” I didn't do it! Who did it if It wasn't you?? Rabbit ghost. You're such a habitual liar! - I'm not lying! - Don't you raise your voice! I can't stand you anymore, come here! Hey! Let go of me! I said, let go of me! Hey. I wanna go home. There's no home. It's either here or orphanage. And you have to at least please auntie to stay here. - Is there anyone who likes you? - There is. Who? Your dad? The lady. Lady Ye-rin? The lady who lives In mom's room. Who lives there? There's no one. She's smiling behind you now. Try this tea. It'll make you feel good. - Well? Good, isn't it? - Yes. Did Ji-yoo make trouble? No... You hide things too much, that's your flaw. You don't have to do that to me. It makes me sad. - Auntie, do you know that? - Hmm? I used to envy Sang-woo every time I came here. Why? You were more like mom to me than my real mom. Well, I see... Yoon-hee was a peculiar person. She pursued a career in piano, but it didn't work out well, giving her a hard time. Then she came to have you. She shouldn't have given birth to me, If she couldn't take care of me. - You blamed your mom, didn't you? - No. I just wanted what a child could want from her mom. Being with me, looking after me and protecting me. I thought you were a bit cold-hearted. You never came here In your high school days. I came here once. When? On the day that mom died. She seemed to be out of her mind again. It hasn't been so long since she broke up with Ji-yoo's dad. mom Mom. Mom, why are you doing this again? Pull yourself together, please? Until when are you gonna do this? Until when are you gonna worry me, huh? I'm afraid of ending up like you. Dad and even grandma say that I'm just like you. Now I hate fighting over you with them, so sick of it! So, don't contact me again. On that day, I thought... ...I wish I never had a mom like her. Sometimes there are things that can't be helped. No matter how much you suffer or resist, things only get worse. But the thing is... family is all we have. I'm sorry I should have taken care of you earlier. We'll look after you even from now on. I just feel like it's a fate that you came here. I'm grateful enough for letting Ji-yoo stay here. That's what I'm here for you. Actually, I wish you could stay here with us too. You can learn how to run a hotel. Families are supposed to be together. Well... let me think about it. Auntie Kyung-sun I searched everywhere but can't find her. What about that staff lady? Did you check her room? Well, seeing that all of her stuffs are still there, I don't think she kidnapped her. - Her phone? - Here. I found it In her room. Um, Officer OH? Ye-rin may have gone downtown. She sometimes does. What, she just goes out without even telling you? You know she has a bit unstable mind. - You go search the neighborhood. - Yes, sir. ls there anywhere else that she might have gone by herself? Ji-yoo. JI-yoo! JI-yoo! Yoo-mi! Auntie, mom is there! Mom is taking her! What? Who's taking her? There she Is! Over ... Don't you worry, just sleep tight. Ji-yoo! JI-Yoo... Hey. You Know... Once there was a drought and the lake dried up, dogs living in well have starved to death and started devouring each other. One... Two... ! Three... Four... Once dogs keep eating dogs, they come to only eat dogs even when there's enough food. Do you know what happens to the last dog? That lady... I saw that lady... Where”?' Deep... down there... That lady... She never died like that. I was completely deceived... What are you saying? Aw... It's stinky... Aw, my head is pounding. I gotta go now. Auntie... - What about her family? - Actually I know nothing about... A witness? Ms. Han, can we talk now? Hey... Ms. Han! How did you end up In Ms. Lee's room? She came to my room first... before I went there. So you followed alive Ms. Lee and found her dead in there? Yes Officer OH, I think now IS not a good time. You can do it tomorrow, okay? What's with her? She's totally out of her mind. No wonder she is. She even saw a dead body while that child is still missing. You're too naive about people. I felt something fishy about her at first glance. You gotta be careful. There are so many weirdos... It's the world where the insane calls the sane insane. Why are you doing this? Are you trying to take me too? You've lived your whole life as you like, not minding others! You think I've been happy? I've had such a hard time too! And I still do now...! Why did you do that though...”? Why did you die on your own? You really shouldn't have... You shouldn't have done that to me... Oh yeah, what about that North Korean defector case”? Well... It's only those who have lost their money to her that are looking for her, not her family. What a shallow, empty life she had... I guess she should be just left unaccounted for. Right... Like so many similar cases, you know. So, to sum up... Your mother killed herself at the hotel five years ago and so did Ms. Lee? The missing child has something to do with those incidents? And the spirits back up your theory...”? I know It sounds weird, but it's all true. So you mean your dead mother took the child, isn't it? Are you kidding me? That's such a nonsense! Ms. Han, are you on your medication? Excuse me”? I saw you used to see a doctor because of depression. Took time off from school. And you sometimes see things or don't remember, right? It wasn't that bad. And now It got better. You're on medication but it's not bad... Okay, then... Ms. Han, where's your sister? Pardon? You don't get it? I can just tell that she was a pain in the ass, wasn't she? You're saying that I did something to her? Why would I even do that when auntie"s gonna raise her? Then why did you flee at night? What were you afraid of? Ms. Han, from now on, you shouldn't leave this town on your own. You know what I mean! Excuse me! Haven't you found her yet? Tap once if it's right, and twice If it's wrong. What are you doing here? Do you live here? Are you alone? Did you die here? Did somebody kill you? Did you Kill yourself? You've seen the child, right? Do you know where she is? Then, by any chance... are you keeping her? I Think... It's not something that I can handle. Let go! Let go of me! Are you okay? You can’t just walk away! Please talk to me... Shit... It's goddamn freaky... What's wrong”? What was that before? What did you see? - A beheaded... dead woman. - And? - A beheaded... dead woman. - And? There was mere? I saw... a live one. The one that you talked to? No, that one Is... net alive nor dead. I don't know such a thing. The best thing to do Is avoid. Wait, what about Ji-yoo? You didn't see her? Oh, please! She might be dead, too. So TN You get out of here now, before you're fucked up. I should run away again, huh...”? Name: SE 0 Eun-kyung Missing date: Sep. 03, 2013 MISSING Are you done already? I know you don't sleep well, but don't take this too much. And... if it lasts too long, I'll get caught... I didn't know Eun-kyung had a friend like you. Thank you for visiting, anyway. Her mother has left her here and is gone until now. She didn't care how her child would be treated. It's been five years already, so I gave up too. I just figure she'd be living In Seoul, as she used to like that city. Does that belong to her? Yeah, it does She used to play that so loud day and night... She brought it saying that someone she knew gave it for free. - Who? - Someone from this town... ...taught her how to play that, she said. Wasn't that this lady? Right. I know her very well. She's a really nice person. She cared a lot about Eun-kyung when she went missing. It turned out she could have felt empathetic to it. I found that something brutal has happened to her family. What are you talking about...”? She sent her child abroad to study, but he went crazy there and came back. So she took him everywhere to try every possible treatment, but none of them worked. [ Heard he eventually hung himself. Sir, we've found that she's the missing lady, KIM Yeon-sil. Timeline of disappearance IS similar as well. She didn't leave a note. I don't think she went off the grid because of money. Oh, man... Where has she gone? What the heck is this...? Don't move! Throw it on the floor. Throw it! - Where's your auntie? - I don't know. We should get out of here now... Don't move. JI-yoo! I told you not to move! Ma'am... Why? In fact... I didn't really like you. I saw what you did to your mom and thought you were very cold-hearted. That's Sang-woo, right? Why did you leave him like that? He's a little sick. He's dead! What do you mean? Dead”' It has just... ...gotten worse again, that's all. He has been very lonely so far. But do you know that? On the day you came here, he showed a reaction. What? I told you it's a fate that you came here. You are crazy... You call me crazy when you can't even see through yourself? I certainly felt that you were living in hell. Auntie... Please let us go. I won't tell anyone. Or let Ji-yoo go, at least. She didn't do anything wrong. Everyone told me they wouldn't tell anyone. But in the end, they tried to keep me away from him. So did Yeon-sil, Ye-rin, and Yoon-hee, too! My mom... Didn't she kill herself? It was her who first told me to bring Sang-woo here. She said she'd protect me and Sang-woo. But in the end... she betrayed us. Eun-kyung! Yoon-hee! No! You're crazy! Listen to me! Yoon-hee! You re out of your mind... No, not any more... Did you kill my mom? Why? You suddenly feel S so pity for her? Did you really kill my mom!? No way. I took her out of hell. You do Know how she was like. , You can just accept it as she did. Then you'll feel relaxed soon. Auntie, don't do this... Please get a hold of yourself! It's you who made Sang-woo like that! You're right... It's me... I did It... I shouldn't have sent him that far away. But now it's okay... Because you're here. Go away! Let me go! Don't move. It be over soon. You like it too, don't you? Now you're gonna live with us. Yoo-mi... Yoo-mi. Wake up... You gotta go home. JI-yoo! Over there... That's the lady. Run, Ji-yoo! Go, Ji-yoo! Ji-yoo! Go! I said... I said we're gonna... look after you...! SIS Sang-woo! Sang-woo... Sweety... Come to me... Ji-yoo! Sis... Does it hurt? No... Not at all. Where are we going now? Now we're going home. Sit tight and fasten your seatbelt. SR
