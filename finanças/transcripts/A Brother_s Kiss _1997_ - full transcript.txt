Well, you know, he goes to school. I mean, you know, when he has nothing to do, he reads a book. Imagine that. Pick my letters for me, Lex. And pick good ones, not like last Friday. Nobody was cheating while I was getting ready? - No. - Mickey? Uh-uhn. Lex? Of course, you're the angel. You would never cheat, would you? All right, I hope you picked me some good ones. - I've got a word. - You do? Yeah. A good one? Already, right? Yeah. What is this that you're spelling? - You'll see. - That's not a word. That's rhythm. That's not rhythm. That's not rhythm. Oh, yes, it is. That's not how you spell rhythm. Oh, come on, it is so. - No, it's not. - There's a Y before. There's no H. No, it doesn't. It has an E at the end, doesn't it? - No. - Oh, no, that's rhyme. No, no, no. I'm telling you, Lex, it is. R-H-Y-T-H-M. - There's no H in rhythm. No, it's R-Y first. It's R-Y-T-Y-M. No, it's not. It's R-H-- what's rytym? What is that? I'm gonna let you slide, man. I'll get the dictionary. [KNOCKING] - Open up, it's the police. - All right, I'm coming. I'm coming. OFFICER: We come for Lex, Doreen. DOREEN: What did he do this time? OFFICER: We got a cop who was stabbed in the park. He knew Lex by name. Come on, Lex. - Mom, he didn't do nothing. DOREEN: Mickey, just stay out of it, OK? Lex, get out of here. - Mom, listen. - Sh. Lex, get over here. The guy was trying to hurt me, Mom. The guy was a cop, Doreen. Mom, please don't make me go with them. - [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Did you do this? - No, I didn't do nothing. - Sh, Mickey. You didn't do it? - No. - Listen to me. - Mickey, stop it for a minute. Come on, pretty boy. Hey. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Mom! DOREEN: Come on, get your hands off me. You want to go too? You want to go to? I [INAUDIBLE] off your ass. Oh, yeah, get the fuck out, you fucking pig. You'd do better to stay off the fucking booze, and keep an eye on your little fucking kids. - He didn't do nothing. - Shut your mouth. You know, you should have seen him when you was away. He didn't know what to do without you. Like if you asked him on any given day how many minutes it was until Lex was just coming, he could tell you. I wasn't feeling too good there for a while, so I sent him to go live with Uncle Mac, but him and Uncle Mac got along real good. You know, I know a lot of boys that got sent to reform school, and well, it just made men out of them. And they never got in any more trouble ever again, all right? - Hey, Mackey. - Hiya, Doreen. How are you? - I'm OK. Give the big one here a chocolate malt and the little gets vanilla. And put an egg in each one? Sure. I got you this for your birthday. Oh, that's the joint, Mom. I hope they fit. Yeah. You know, I played a lot of basketball up there. Yeah? Coach says I got natural talent. That's great. Plus I hustle, play defense. I pass a lot too, you know. We played as a team up there. I was in a state wide tournament and I won a medal. - No kidding? - Yeah. I've brought it for you. That's really sweet, Lex. Hey, Mickey, take a look. That's cool, Lex. That's cool. Hey, Mac, did you see what Lex won? What's that, Doreen? Oh, look at this. What do we got here? Hey. We got an athlete in a family now, huh? Congratulations. I'm proud of you. - Thanks, Mac. Now, shoot foul shots. Know why? Because you practice tracks when you're tired, and a real game will come natural to you. Mom hoked me up this year. This is the serious joint right here. Where'd you get that tattoo from, Lex? Up north. MICK: How you did that? With a needle, thread, and ink. MICK: That hurted, right? Hell, yeah, it hurt. MICK: So what was it like up there? It's boring, man. Lot of cows, ducks, pigs, shit like that. MICK: It was fun? No, that shit was no fun, man. They make you get up at the crack of dawn, milk the cows. The hicks up there, these used to fuck the cows. Fuck the cows? LEX: And made the baby cows suck their dicks. Get the fuck outta here. LEX: I'm serious. That's disgusting. Baby cows. Nothing else happened, did it? Like what? Like what? You get in a lot of fight and shit. Yeah. Check it out. This one time, I was going back to my basketball practice to my locker room, everyone told me not to go in there. It was all quiet and shit, so I knew something was up. On the way back to the bunk, I see this big motherfucker gargantuan, before I could even put my hands up, yo, he smacked me dead in the face, knocked me out. Knocked you out? I woke up in the hospital. Everyone thought I was dead and shit. What happened while you was asleep? I don't know, man, because I was out. After that, Lefty got sent up. Tito from [INAUDIBLE] projects, he got sent up. Little Joe Joe from Jefferson park got sent up too. They cut that motherfucker gargantuan in his sleep. Nobody fucked with us after that. Don't go back there, Lex. LEX: Shit, I ain't going back there. Hells, no. I'm gonna be a professional basketball player. I'm gonna be a professional detective, and I'm gonna have a 357 Magnum like Clint Eastwood. We're going to be professionals, right? Yeah. Let's go to this party before it gets too late. [MUSIC PLAYING] Aesha, how you doing? Hi. You're still keeping a picture of me under your pillow, right? Of course. Promise me, you'll never leave me again. Never. What's up, man. If I ever catch you giving fucking reefer, a smoke, a fucking drink to my brother, I'll cut your fucking throat. Say I won't. - Sorry, Lex. Sorry. - Say I won't. I'm sorry, Lex, sorry. What's the pack we made? - I ain't do nothing. - What's the pact we made? - I didn't do nothing. - What's the pact we made? Never drink, smoke, or do nothing. Why not? Because we're going to be professionals, man, that's why. Why aren't you dancing, man? I asked one girl, but she said no. How you sound, man? A hundred no's don't mean shit, man.

Lex, your brother don't know what to do. Teach him. DOREEN: Let's make the bed squeak. Sh. The boys will hear us. [GROANING NOISES] Lex, can you come here? What's up? You're gonna get mad. - What happened? - It's Uncle Mac. LEX: What's up with him this time, man? He asks me to come live with him. Oh, yeah? For what? MICK: He said it's better over here. How? He got lots of food. Uncle Mac brings it home from the restaurant, like roast beef, turkey, mashed potato with a lot of gravy, and they never fight about food. And he wants us to come live with him? That's the thing. LEX: What? He says he can't handle both of us. Oh, yeah, right. MICK: He said he's gonna tell you himself, but I said I wanted to. So you gonna go with him? It's only three blocks away. LEX: See ya. It ain't like I'm moving to Jersey or nothing. LEX: Just, go, man. Get the fuck out of here already. I bet if I whistle from Uncle Mac's fire escape, you can hear me [INAUDIBLE]. Yo, man, you tell that fat bastard, Uncle Mac I'm never coming to visit him, all right? You neither, man.

I'll get them next time. Lex, you're too old. You have no college. You're not going to be a pro player. You and me, we're both going to starve. LEX: We're never going to starve. You know why? Why? Because if it don't work out here this year, next year, we're going to Europe. - Europe? - Yeah. Remember that guy from Lisbon? He still writes me. You're gonna love it. Lisbon, then, in the off season, we travel, Madrid, Rome. Europe. How do you like the new uniform, Ma? I think you're gonna freeze your ass off, Mickey. What is it with you and the cold.

Those uniforms don't look so warm to me, big shot with your own apartment. You're thinking about the old uniforms. These are the new uniforms. We got the down coat in the wintertime.

All right, according to legend, right, my father used to beat my mother's ass. This guy tried to kill me before. Why'd he try to kill you? Because I didn't want to see him anymore. Why didn't you want to see him no more? Because he kept getting locked up and shit, you know? And I ain't trying to live like that anymore. Because you're a good girl, right? Yeah, I'm good.

Why the fuck would I be jealous of you and a girl? That would make me an asshole. I'm not an asshole. I'm not jealous. How come you never had a girlfriend then? I've had girls, you just don't know them. Yeah, nobody knows them. I'm not getting into this. Look at me. Sex is a good thing, OK? It's good. - Whatever you say. Yeah, man, we were never taught that, right? We seen a lot of shit before we should have, but that's over. It's in the past, and you gotta enjoy your life. - You finished, Oprah? - No, I'm not. Look, you're a good looking guy, all right? I mean, you're my brother. We got the same blood. Girls are going to like you, guys are going you. It's OK. What's OK? I don't care if you're a fag, Mick.

I'm going to take care of it. You don't know the first fucking thing about being a father, Lex. I'll learn. There's no schools, OK? There's no god damn schools. The only thing you know is basketball. Now, you fucked that thing up too, for Christ's sakes. MICK: Ma, come on. Shut up, Mickey, all right? Just stay out of it. You know, what you are? You're a sucker. OK, you ever heard that word before? You know what it means? That's what you never brought her around, OK? That's why you never told me. She trapped you, and you know it, and you're a fucking sucker.
