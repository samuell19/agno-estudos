- Hey. - Hey. Hey, buddy. - Detective. He's ready for us. You know you can't smoke in here. - Yeah. You can't smoke anywhere anymore. - You gonna put it out? - When I'm done smokin' it. - You wanna charge him with a health code violation, too? - Look, we can end all of this right now with a simple confession. - Fine, he confesses to being an experienced, highly decorated officer. - The victim's filed a racial profiling complaint saying that you and your partner kicked in the door without warning. - And she'll tell you we wore white hoods and burnt crosses to get her charges dropped. - Do you know how many misconduct complaints you have registered against you in the past year? - Don't know. Don't care. - Seven. Seven. - Look. For every asshole we bust out there, there's bound to be a complaint filed against us. Racism, police brutality, lack of Miranda, you name it. That gives their scumbag lawyers leverage trying to plea down their charges. Racism complaints are par for the course for every real cop who's out there, not in here hiding behind a desk, whether you're white or black. Sorry, African American. - I'm not African. I'm Caribbean. - Oh, for fuck sakes. Fine. Black, colored, African American, pigmenty-challenged, whatever. - I'm gonna enjoy taking your shield from you. - Then go ahead. Take it. - In due time. In the meantime, you wanna explain how 15 grand just disappears? - Nope, because I know nothing about it. - Your partner told us that you took the cash from the scene to your cruiser. - That's funny. Do you know that I helped Detective Mason climb up the ladder of this shithole the last 10 years? That I was the godfather to her only child? And now you're tellin' me that after watchin' those backs over the last decade, she's gonna turn on me in here? Now who's the liar? - We've subpoenaed your financial records. Once the bank opens in the morning, we'll see. - This is a second generation cop who's given 20 years to the department, okay? - It's not about what he gave. It's about what he took. - You know what? You're right. I'll put it out. Weeks. Weeks, wait up. - That was a fuckin' ambush inside there. - You know what's what IA does, you know that. - That's the first I'm hearing about them opening my bank account tomorrow morning. Tell me I'm not your first fucking case. - Look, there's no discovery process in an interrogation. And he could've just made that whole bank thing up just to get you to talk. All right? On that note, is there anything you wanna tell me? - I'm innocent. Tell me there's something you can do. - I have done something. I've kept you on the roster during all this. But if he has two sworn statements and tomorrow morning the bank shows them you made a huge deposit right after this went down, that's it. - So you're tellin' me there's nothing you can do? - I'm telling you that if they have their way, tonight may be your last night in the department. Hey, Charlie, it's me. It's June 30th. So even though Michael's not, I just thought he would've liked it if, goddamn it. It is, or was, his day. So I just thought that maybe for his sake, we could talk or... I miss you. - Anything important? - Uh, yeah. We're now the number one US city in sex trafficking. - Oh, yay for us. - Mm-hmm. Drugs arrest are up. Changes in our health care coverage. - Same old shit. - How'd it go with IA? - It was bullshit. She was cryin' Rodney King so she can get her shit dropped. As long as it takes. No, she's my daughter. She needs inpatient care. I just wanna know if there's an opening and how much it'll cost me. Yes, I left my number with him. I know he's very busy, but this is important. Thanks. Yeah, you, too. Any luck? Not yet, but I'm gonna work on it. How's that? I'm still working on the particulars. But I may need a favor from you. No problem. A big favor. Name it. Thanks. I'll let you know when I need it. But for now. Away we go. Another night in paradise. - Well, the sun'll come out tomorrow, right? - Forecast calls for rain on and off. - I meant it as, you know, more of a positive way of thinking. - Well, I'm positive I don't know what I would do if I caught Erica out here, whether I'd shoot myself or her. - Don't let that thought creep in. It's not gonna happen. - It's a slippery slope. Look, she's just going through a rough patch. You gonna tell me you didn't do any drugs when you were her age? - At least I didn't put myself in a goddamn three-day coma. - Look, she may need something to get through today, but that doesn't mean that she'll need it tomorrow. - Well, you went through a rough patch. How's your tomorrow? - You wanna talk about your feelings all night, or can we go do some good? - Okay. Let's go do some good. - Well, well, KK. I didn't expect to see you back here so soon. - Yeah, no thanks to you. - Now you wouldn't be dumb enough to post bail and be back out here dealing the very next day, would you? - Oh, no, not at all. I'm just out here waiting on my boy. I don't have my ride no more, so. - You know I can read minds, right? - You're crazy. - No, seriously, watch. Right now, you're picturing yourself suckin' off one dude while another one's bangin' you from behind. - The fuck's wrong with you? - Oh, wait, shit, sorry, that's the future. I can also predict the future. That's the wrong frequency. - You know, fuck you, that ain't my future. - Yes, it is because you have a bag of X in your right pocket and three crack rocks in your left. - Why you fuckin' with me? - I also predict you're about to get very hurt. We can't keep meeting like this. - No, no, no, KK. Spin it. - Come on. - Spread 'em. - Told ya. What the fuck? - Oh, what is that? No, no, no, no, no, no, man. - Oh, no, that's not good. Come on. Spin it. - Damn, I said three rocks. It's pretty close though, right? - Oh, fuck you. Lock me up again, I don't give a shit. Well, that's exactly why we're not gonna do it, KK. - Hey, hey, hey! Aw, no. - If the courts won't do their part, we are happy to go the extra mile. - Fuck you, y'all are stealin' for me. You can't do that, you're cops, right? - Oh, we're not robbin' you, KK. We're just taking your shit outta circulation, buddy. - Yo, that right there, that's Lincoln's shit, and he will fuckin' slice your throats for this. - Never heard of him. - Oh, you will, I can promise you that. - Make it rain. Catch you out here one more time, I'm gonna put you underneath the jail. All right, joke. What do you call a redneck on fire? - You've told me this one before. - Yes, I know, but we're early in the shift, and I could use a little happy-happy right now. So what do you call a redneck on fire? - I don't know, Weeks, what? - A firecracker. - That's fuckin' awful. We were just here yesterday. - I'll be in and out. I know, I know. - This has become quite a pattern. - Can I see her? - The question is, do you think she'll see you? - You could ask her. - Visitor for Miss Erica Weeks. - Thanks for seeing me so late. How are you? - I'm better, much better. Yeah? - Yeah. - That's good to hear. - So did you call mom? I did. - And? - And she hasn't returned any of my phone calls yet. - So try again. - I've left five voicemail messages so far. But I'll try again. - Well, maybe you can sign me out. - I can't. - Why not? - Because your mother has custody and I don't. And besides, the doctors wanna keep you here a little longer. - How much longer? - Two months. - Two months? - Listen to me, listen. I got a plan to get you outta here and into a better place in a couple a weeks. - I don't want a better place. I just wanna go home. - Erica, I'm going to get you out of here, and I think I know how. But I don't think I can do it by myself, so I'm gonna have Mason help-- - Shut up, just shut up! Why are you here? - Because you're my daughter. - So what? - So what? So I care for you. - You care for me? You've been a ghost for most of my life, and now that there's a small problem, you think-- - A small problem? - A small fucking problem. You think you can just swoop in and fix everything. - Erica, if your mother didn't come early that day, you'd be in a pine box right now. I don't call that a small problem. - I just... I don't know how much longer I can take it here. - I know. - No, you don't. No, you don't know. Dad, you've gotta get me out of here, please. I miss you, Mom. Ready to roll? - Uh, yeah. She doing any better? - No. But I think she's finally hit rock bottom. - That's a good thing? - The only way she can go now is up. - How do you know when you're at the bottom? - Ask the next drug dealer I take down there. Come on. - You wanna talk about it? - No. - She is getting treatment. She'll get better-- I said no. - Wanna go code 27? - I'm not hungry. - There's this new place open in Little Five, discount for badges, full bar. - Motherfucker. Yo, we good? Yeah. - Don't you run. Help. - Son of a bitch. - Hey! All right, enough! You'll fuckin' kill him, hey, hey! That's enough. Get the fuck off me! I chased him halfway across the fuckin' state. - Yeah, I know, 40 people saw you. He files a complaint looking like a used tampon, and we're on suspension tomorrow. - He ain't gonna file shit. - You broke my fucking nose. - It's pieces of shit like you is why my daughter's wearing a goddamn hospital gown. Did you sell some shit to my daughter? - No, I don't even know who your daughter is. - I don't believe you. - Hey. - Lincoln's gonna smoke you for fuckin' with me. - This Lincoln's getting pretty popular. - He'll fuck you up, then he'll ass-fuck your daughter. - The fuck you just say, motherfucker? - Hey, hey, hey, you shut the fuck up, and you chill the fuck out. - Say it again. - Dead pig. You don't fucking matter. - Oh, only black lives matter, huh? - Damn right. - Now tell me again about my daughter. 'Cause if I don't matter, I can't do shit, right? - Weeks. This isn't worth it. - My daughter's name is Erica. Now say her name just one time, and I'll shatter your black brain matter over that fucking wall. Now say her name, I fucking dare you. - All right. Hey! Hold still. Help. Stop moving. - Nice choke hold. - Look, get it together. This is not worth our careers, okay? - You know that's not legal anymore, right? - Hey. Hey! Hey. Holy shit, holy shit, he's not breathing. - Well, give him mouth to mouth. - I don't know CPR. You give him mouth to mouth. - I'm a fucking pig, remember? I don't know CPR. - I'm calling it in. Can't get a fucking signal down here. Dispatch, this is 22. We need, hey! Hey, what are you, what is wrong with you? What the hell, he's fucking dying. - Motherfucker. Weeks! It's not on YouTube yet. - Doesn't it take a day or two? - He can do it in seconds with a single swipe. It's not on Twitter either. We shouldn't have left him there. - Are you kidding me? Why not? He had a pocket full of meth. Once the ME cracks him open, it's a drug deal gone bad. Open and close. - I only choked him to get him to stop resisting. And you, I thought you were gonna blow his fucking head off. - I was. - I killed somebody. If this video gets out there, you with a gun to his head and me choking him when he's already on the ground, he was unarmed. - He was a death dealer. How many times did we bust him before? Six, seven? - That doesn't matter. Two white cops just killed an unarmed black kid. - He sold poison to kids. Fuck him. I don't give a good goddamn color what he was. - Yeah, well, a grand jury's gonna give a good goddamn, and they're not even gonna bother with a trial. We don't get suspended. We don't get fired. We go to fucking prison for the rest of our lives. - That ain't gonna happen. Now stop and think for a minute. The kid videotaping, you never seen him before? - I didn't see him tonight. - The Latin kid Deacon was dealing his drugs to when we rolled up on 'em. - When we rolled up, I was trying to chase after your ass. You telling me he's young and Latin narrows it down to about 2,000 kids in the metro. It's not on Facebook. - Here. - That's the last thing I need right now. - No, this is the only thing you need right now. If he didn't upload it, what do you think he wants to do with it? - He'd try to sell it. - Exactly, and local news would definitely pay top dollar for that footage. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, if he tried to call them, I mean, they wouldn't believe him, but they'd have his number. - So it's a good thing we know the king of local news then. Who else would help us right now? - He doesn't answer my calls, Weeks. - Then call his work. - I'm trying to get him back, not piss him off. - That's funny. I thought we were trying to stay out of prison. - I don't know what I'm trying to do. - Control room. Chuck Mason, please. - Chuck, phone. - This is Chuck. - Hi. It's me. - You know you can't call me here, I'm working. I tried your cell. - We talked about this. I need to move on. - And you just, what, want to throw me away? - I'm not the one who, never mind. Don't call here again. Goodbye. - Wait. I wasn't calling to talk about us. - Then why'd you call? - I need your help. - Do you have a phone number? - Yeah. 404-612-- 612. - 8789. - 89. Did he sell it yet? - No, not yet. He's calling around, though, trying to find the highest bidder. It's only a matter of time before some affiliate takes him seriously enough to bring him in and watch it. - Not if we get to him first. Registered to Priscilla Sanchez, age 40, one dependent, Luis Sanchez, age 15. They live off Old National Highway. Away we go. What did you have to give him? - Give who? - Chuck, on the phone, for the kid's number. You had to give him something. - No. I didn't have to give him anything. - Yeah, I'm sure he did it out of the kindness of his own heart. - Give it a rest, okay? He's not as bad as you think. - He didn't used to be such a dick to you either. - Yeah, well, I fucked that up. - It was a goddamn accident, all right? It could've happened to anyone. - Well, it didn't. Happened to me. And Charlie. He's still pissed at me, and I don't blame him. - Well, I blame him. - I had to promise I'd never call him again. - Ever? - Ever. - That is so fucked. - Michael used to ask me how come Superman couldn't keep everybody safe so I could just stay home and play with him. Truth is, even Superman wouldn't be enough to clean up this dump. - What the hell are you talkin' about? - I thought getting a badge would be like having a superpower, like, yeah, I couldn't leap tall buildings in a single bound or anything, but I could save Lois Lane. I'd wanna be able to fly backwards around the Earth. You remember that part? - Yeah, he turns back time to get a second chance. - Yeah. Yeah. - It's not just you, okay? Anyone who says they have no regrets is a liar. - Yeah. - Except for me. I have no regrets. - Right, me neither. But all the product we cleared in all the years we've been doing this, I mean, we've made some kind of difference, right? - No. All right, you wanna make a difference? Here's your shot. You keep us out of orange jumpsuits. - How do you wanna play this? - He's 14 years old. He doesn't talk, we tear up his Pokeman cards. - Weeks, this is important. - Okay. We'll play up the middle. I start tearing up his shit, you try to stop me. - Sounds about right. - Si? - I'm Detective Crockett. This is Detective Tubs. We're here to see Luis. - Luis? - English. Do you speak English? Nobody speaks English anymore. Why do I feel like a foreigner in my own country? - I got this. Hey, police-io. Hey. Police-io. Wake the fuck up. - What? - Wake the fuck up. Rise and shine. - Hey, where is your phone? - I don't know. - Oh, really? Okay. Get the fuck back. Stay on your bed. You like rap music? Yeah. - I can't stand this crap. - Hey, what the fuck? That's my demo. - Get her back. Now if I have to keep asking you the same question, I'm gonna break more than your goddamn CDs, you understand me? Now where's your fucking phone? - I told you, man, I don't know. Check his stuff. Look what we've got here. - Oh, wow. Looks like most of Bolivia to me. He must be supplying half the high school with this shit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Get her back. Get her outta here. - Mom, it's not mine. Tino must've left it when he came by. - Religious kid, huh? Yeah. Oh no. Wow, you actually hid drugs inside a bible. Got to be kidding me. Where's your phone? - I told you, man. I don't fucking know. - Okay, I'm gonna tell you what I know. You start talkin', or I start stompin'. This is worth, what, what do you think? 3,000 on the street? Yeah, about that. I mean, we're not gonna arrest you. We're just gonna leave you to explain to your friends how you lost three grand worth of their shit. - But you're cops. You can't just do that. Oh my god. - Where's your phone? - I mean, I don't know nothing. Come on, man, please. - Where's your phone? - Fine, Goosebumps. Sure as hell hope that means something. You know this place? Yeah, I've been here once or twice, when I was low on cash and self-esteem. - That bad, huh? - It's not the Playboy Mansion. - All right, well, just do us a favor and keep your white robe and your pointy hat in the car. - That's a low blow. You know I'm not racist. Have you ever heard me say the N word? - Doesn't mean you're not racist. - I don't even know what the word means anymore, racist. If I don't like rap music, I'm a racist. If I wanna give somebody a fist bump instead of a handshake, I'm a racist. This hypersensitive shit is ridiculous. But you know I'll beat down any color of shitbag that's out there. I will give you that. You are an equal opportunity asshole. - Evening. It's five dollar cover. - We're here to see Buck. - Never heard of him. - Well, maybe we can poke around in there, see if we can find him. - Sure, five dollar cover. Otherwise, I'd suggest you turn around and head that way on foot patrol. - How 'bout if I just knock all your teeth out, then smash your head against the wall? - Listen, check with downtown. We're already paid in full, cop. - We're not here for money, jack. - Well, then maybe you shouldn't be here at all. - Okay, girls, all right, let's clam down. Look, we've all seen enough TV cop shows to know how this goes. You're the tough bouncer, we're the tough cops, nobody's gonna back down, right? So like an old episode of Baretta, you're gonna say something else tough. My partner will put his fist into your throat, at which point you'll bend over gasping for air. He'll then kick you in the head. You'll fall to the ground, bleeding and screaming, and then finally, he will put your face in that wall just to fulfill an earlier promise. Then you will have a one-way ticket to the ER, and we'll just walk in anyway. So let's not fall into reruns here, shall we? - Okay, shit. I only make 12 bucks an hour. Go find your boy. - Good call. Which one is he? - The white one. Thanks. ♪ If you take me there ♪ ♪ To your man, don't take me there ♪ White guys, huh? Well, this limits the possibilities. - Don't worry. Hey, bouncer says you gotta move your car. - What car? I took the bus. - Oh, my bad, you're not Buck? - No, that's Buck. - I'll let him know. Thank you. Hey, Buck, how's it going? - I don't know, officers. I'm just here for the bible study. - Another smart ass. This place should be a comedy shop. - Look, we thought you might be able to give us some information. - Well, I guess you thought wrong. - Well, we heard you have something we might want to buy. - The only thing I sell is fantasy. Carla, tease your tits. - You know what we mean. - No matter what you've heard, I don't sell nobody. - Look, we can do this in public or in private, and for your sake, I would suggest the latter. - Holy shit. You're the ones from the video. - Where's the fucking phone? - Back off. What's his problem? - He's camera shy. Look, is there somewhere quieter that we can negotiate? - Ain't gonna be no negotiation. I got the phone. It's right downstairs in my office. - After you. - Have a seat, make yourself comfortable. I thought I was gonna have to hunt you down. - Give me a reason why I don't put my drop gun in your car and violate your ass back to the six by 10. - I'll give you one shining good reason. - How much you want for it? - For what? - Does it look like we're here to fuck around? - Phone's not for sale. I traded Luis a lot of meth for this. He just didn't understand I wasn't just buying a phone. I's buying two cops. - Yeah, how's that? - This club's like a weigh station. Brothers on the street nab them a runaway, an immigrant, someone that needs help, and they sell her to me. I let the gang run a train on her, break her in real nice. Then I put her on stage upstairs to shake her ass or I sell her as a sex slave. - You do realize you're talking to two cops now, right? - Nah. I'm talking to my two newest employees. Damn jungle bunnies keep getting busted transporting my girls 'cross town. You two pigs are the solution to my problem. - You gotta be fucking kidding me. What's this? - That's the address for your first assignment. I want you to pick up a sweet teen from her cage and deliver her across town before sunrise. My boy Lincoln, he'll give you the drop off location when you get there. - You saw what's on the video, haven't you? - Yeah, real nice work. - You saw what we did to him. What makes you think we won't do the same thing to you? - I have already backed up the video. Anything happens to me, it goes online. You two are mine now. You'll move that bitch across town, or I'll post the video. You be going to prison where they'll fuck you up the ass for the next 50 years. I think you two are getting off mighty easy. - You're bluffing. There's no backup. - You are the only thing standing between me and my pension. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Give up the phone. - Or what? - What the fuck? - You weren't bluffing. - You can't just shoot a guy. - Well, he may disagree with you right about now. Here, take this. I don't know how to work these fucking things. - God, give it to me. - Call me an ambulance. I'm fucking dying, call me an-- - Yeah, I'm gonna burst into tears any moment now. - Are you gonna call me an ambulance or what? - Or what. We gotta grab the body. - Oh my god, just shut up for a second, okay? Let me think. - No, we don't have a second. We don't have a minute. Grab his fucking leg. - We can't move the body, Weeks. He's wearing a goddamn ankle bracelet. - Aw, fuck. What the fuck are you on? We got a dead body in there, and you're at Burning Man. - Spare me the lecture, all right? You ain't been through what I've been through. - No, I haven't, I've been through a lot more. - Look, I may be high, but I'm not blind. I'm not the only one taking shit. - If you got something to say, you say it. - That woman who went to IA, you took the money. - Are you callin' me a thief? - No. I'm calling you a liar and a thief. Fuck! Ugh, that hurt. I'm sorry. - I'm not. You deserve that for all the shit you pulled tonight. - Fair enough. What the fuck are we gonna do? - Well, for starters, we put as much distance between ourselves and the scene of the crime as humanly possible. - I like that. - Good. - Oh, what the fuck? - Yo, these them? - Yeah, the bitches that jacked me. - Yo, you burned two grand that belonged to me. I want it back. - Get the fuck off my car. - Fuck your car. - You shouldn't have done that. - What, we supposed to be scared? We got guns, too. Yo, you know who the fuck I am? - Should I even care? - Oh, you should. I'm Lincoln Monroe. I'm runnin' this bitch now. - Yeah, you're Buck's bitch. You drive little girls around town for him. - I'm nobody's bitch, bitch. - Driving Miss Daisy, huh? He make you pick cotton for him after you're done driving him around town? - Lincoln, stoke that motherfucker. - You know, I ain't killed a cracker before. - Ain't about to either. Let's see who's the bitch. - I guess you missed the flashing lights and sirens. - Me and this motherfucker got unfinished business. - Finish it later, unless you want a personal tour of jail. - Catch you later, old-timer. - Well, I guess you just make friends with everybody, huh? - Yeah, when I'm not stealing old ladies' pocket purses. - Well, I just came by to see how your last night was going. Only got a couple hours until the bank opens. - I don't give a shit what time the bank opens. - Hey, hey, look, I'm just trying to save everybody some embarrassment here, okay? You, me, the department. Nobody wants to get caught with their pants down. Now if there's something that you wanna tell me, then we can still work something out. - So now you wanna help me out? - Look, you've been on the force a lot of years. Everybody respects that. I just wanna help you go out gracefully. I can help you with that. - You either gonna charge me or not. Otherwise, I got two words for you. Go fuck yourself. - Enjoy your last night playing cop. - Fuck IA. I thought they assigned you a lawyer from our union. - That's part of the problem. - So this is really it? Our last night. - That's what he says. - Got it. - Well, delete that shit. - Done. - Gone forever? No backup, no cloud, no nothing, none of that bullshit? - As far as I know, this is the only recording. - Yeah, well, that's what Nixon said, too. Let me have that. I just wanna make sure. You texted him, didn't you? - No, I didn't text him. I was just checking my messages. - Checking your messages from him? - Look, you're not in my situation, so you have no idea. - No? Oh, I have a good goddamn idea. I mean, he bailed on you when you needed him the most. I was there when he said, "'Til death do us part." - Well, death did do us part. - Fucking IA assholes. Maybe I can sue them for harassment. What the hell? - Oh, shit. - You can see only here on Channel 3 News. We now have video of the two Atlanta police officers suspected of killing an unarmed teenager early this morning. Here's a piece of the terrifying footage-- Wait, stop! - You gotta be fucking kidding me! Fuck! Goddamn it. I thought it wasn't uploaded. You told me it wasn't uploaded! - I didn't know. Why are you yelling at me? - Because your ex is on TV right now trying to bury us. What the fuck is he doing? - I'm sure every station is running the story right now, not just his. - How in the fuck did it end up online? - Buck must've started uploading it when he got the phone, and he was probably planning on taking it down when we left, but you just fucking blew him away before he had the chance. - Fuck! Fuck! Fucking son of a bitch. Fuck! What the? - Hey, hey! - What the fuck you doing? - Give it back, you piece of shit! You fucking asshole! Hey! - Look at you. You're a fucking junkie. Goddamn it. - You think this is it for me? This is the bottom? - If you have to ask, probably not. At least you have company. You were right, about what you said. - I said a lot of shit. - Earlier. About the money. That black chick who went to IA. I thought that it would help Erica get clean, that it would pay for a rehab facility that would work. And the fucked up part is, it just wasn't enough to get her into a better place. I'm a shitty cop. But I'm an even worse thief. - I can't say I would've done anything differently in your shoes. But that's the least of our troubles right now. - Every cop in Atlanta's looking for us right now. - And every reporter. - They're gonna put us in the electric chair for this. - I don't blame them. We gotta get off the street. - And go where? - Out of here, out of sight. We just need to buy some time and think this over. - There ain't no thinkin' this over. We're dead cops walking. - Well, then we're at least entitled to one last cigarette. Come on. Let's get off the street. - This is fucking awful. Why don't you smoke those electronic vapor cigarettes? - Because I'm not cool enough to vape. - That's true. Fuck it. We had a pretty good run, didn't we? - We didn't. - That's fucked up to say. - Imagine that you never become a cop and we never met. You never became a badge, or... your son never died. - Not a day goes by that I don't think about that. - And? - And nothing. I fucked up my life, everyone else's around me. - And you think you'd be really happy as a soccer mom in the 'burbs? - No. But they would've been. I could've lived with that. They could've, too. - And you could've been worse off after all. No one has a crystal ball. - We're going away for a long time. The world's gonna be different when we get out. - If we get out. If they were to give you one last phone call before they throw the switch, would you still call Chuck? - Yeah. - I think I have an idea how you can get Chuck to call you back. Light's on for the chair. Teleprompters up. get mic, please. Trooping, are ready, lower thirds are loaded. We're gonna start with the intro bump back. All right, stand by, everyone, here we go. In five, four, three. - Welcome back. We're now joined live by Officer Clara Mason who was in the controversial and brutal video we played for you again before the break. Officer Mason, first question, obviously, is, why did you kill an unarmed man? - I would never try to kill anyone. I was trying to defuse the situation. - Why was the situation so elevated to begin with? - Why don't you return my calls or texts? What the fuck is she doing? Graphics, get that outro up in case we need to bump out. - Stick with me here. Now how did this whole situation start? - I'll answer your questions if you answer mine. Camera, keep the roll. Charles, get her back on the fucking script. - I don't understand. You have questions? - I'm happy to help your ratings and answer your questions about the video and help your career, but you're not the only one who wants answers. Why don't you return my calls? - Let's stick to the story here. Now this brutal video is trending across the country, and how did you first encounter the victim? - You first. Why don't you answer my calls? - 'Cause I don't wanna talk to you. Michael would still be here-- We're still live, Charles. Pull it the fuck together. - How did you first encounter the victim? - My partner and I witnessed him dealing meth to a teenage boy. We gave chase on foot and caught up with him in the tunnel. Do you know how sorry I am for what happened? - You being sorry doesn't change it. Listen, the producers wanna keep the live roll, so this is all you, Charles. - What prompted your partner to draw his weapon? - I lost our son. That's something I have to deal with every minute of every day. - And me, too. Why wouldn't you have just locked the fucking gun safe? - I was rushed, I thought I had. I've replayed this so many times in my mind. - You destroyed my whole world. - And mine, too. We can't just give up and move on. - Yes. That's exactly what we do. - I can't. I can't, you're the only other person who feels what I feel. - I don't feel anything for you. - Charlie. I need you. You're the only other person who loves Michael as much as I do. If we die, then he dies, too. - Michael died two years ago, and I'll never forgive you for that. So what now? I was hoping you'd tell me. We could keep driving, just keep going. - To where? They'll catch us eventually. - Another country then. South America somewhere. - Whatever the fuck that means. Besides, our passport and license was flagged hours ago. We couldn't even book a golf cart right now. - What about a boat? - Dream on. Look, we gotta face the music. There's no way around it. - Prison's not for us. - Well, I'm not going Thelma and Louise with you either. - Fucked it all up, didn't we? What a shitty way to go out. - We don't have to go out this way. There's still one move we can make. - Suicide? - The girl. - What about her? - You heard what Buck said. They're gonna break her in, sell her like a black market kidney. - She's not our problem. We have enough problems already with this. - Yeah, we've done our fair share of shit. This is our chance to do something good. - Getting ourselves shot doesn't really appeal to me. - This is our last night. Don't you wanna make some kind of difference? - No. Not really. - What if this were Erica? - Aw, fuck you. - They're gonna treat her like a sock puppet, and her life will be over. This is somebody's Erica. - God, I hate you. One last shit show together? - Fuck it. Let's ride. You know this neighborhood, right? - I know enough to stay out of it. I'm gonna stop here. - Ready? - No. But if we're going down, it ain't in a courtroom. Let's see what we're workin' with here. I'll take left. - I'll take right. I'll see you out front. - I saw her. Where is she? - In a side room. You see anybody? I saw four assholes. - They armed? - Like a fucking platoon. - Okay, we'll go in through the front, just make our way through. - We go that way, we're gonna catch a lot of bullets. - We're gonna catch a lot of bullets either way. They're spread out, and we're outnumbered. - And we're outgunned, and we don't know what to expect inside. - Shit. - This is not a good entry. - You know of a better one? - Look, the chances are once we go inside of us coming out here alive is not good. - Beats the hell out of a prison cell. - Well, we did wanna make a difference, right? - I wouldn't want it any other way. - Neither would I. - Hey, look, before we go in, I just wanna say... - Me too. ♪ Oh, and you can look into my eyes ♪ - Well, ain't this some shit. - My sentiments exactly. - Why the fuck you come here? - I came to get the girl. - You're shittin' me. Her? Who gives a fuck about her? - I do. - Why? You her family or something? - I've never even met her. - So, you tellin' me you lyin' here bleeding out for some piss-poor ass burrito bitch that you don't even know? That's right. - Before I smoke your motherfucking ass, tell me why. - She's my Lois Lane. - Hmm, aw, touching. Well, too bad nobody gives a fuck enough to rescue you. - There is one person. - Oh, yeah, who that? Aw, shit. Grandpa returns. Yeah, we gonna finish this shit. First, I'm gonna shoot you, then I'm gonna shoot-- - That doesn't make me a racist. - Yeah, you definitely don't discriminate. I think you've killed just about one of everything tonight. - No lives matter. - Nice. I'll print up some t-shirts. - You're wounded. - Worry about yourself, okay? I'll call it in. Don't call it in. What? Why? Think about it. You, me, the department, none of us are coming out of this clean. Yeah. - But Erica could. - Right, and you're gonna see her again. You just need a doctor. - You're not hearing me, Mason. I don't want a doctor. Just before we started this shift, I asked you for a big favor, and you said, "Name it." I'm cashing that in. - What? - They're going to convene a grand jury in a few hours. After that, my ass is history. They're gonna transfer me from the hospital to county. You know what that means for a badge in there. - I'm not gonna do this. - Yes, you are, 'cause technically, I'm still a cop. If I get killed in the line of duty, I keep my life insurance payout. That means my beneficiary, Erica, can get clean, and she can start a new life. - I can't. - You can do this if you're my friend. - Please, Weeks. - I've never asked for a favor from you in all these years. - Weeks. I can't. - Just make sure Erica uses the money to get to a real clinic, all right? Someplace nice. I've always been there for you. I need you to be there for me now. - Thanks, for everything. See you on the other side. - Yeah. Unit A-22 requesting help, officer down. 22, officer down, please repeat. - You heard me. Roger that, 22. What's your location? - I'm at the bottom.
