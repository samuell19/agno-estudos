- Leave me alone! - Hey! Get away from me, John. I mean it. - C-can't we-can't we just talk? - No! - Where are you going? - I am having this baby! - It's not fair, Alexis. - Life's not fair. This is crazy, you're barely 18. I'm an adult, John. I'm gonna be an amazing mother with or without you. - Move! - I'm not saying that. Then what are you saying, John? This is a mistake. Maybe you were the mistake. - I'm having this baby. - I won't let you do it. - I'm not moving, alright! - Out of the way, John! - I'm not moving! - Move now! - Now get out of the car! - Move now! No. What are you do.. No, no, no! 'Thanks to your support, The Hillside Park project' will soon be the centerpiece of Downtown Aniston. All for you and your families to enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. So, please feel free to explore. - Great job, boss. - This was a team effort. Well, then you're the best team captain ever. Aww. It's Hailey, she organized a blood drive at her school and I promised I would donate. I gotta go. Yeah, go. I got this covered. - Hey, Brooke. I'm proud of you. - Yeah? I couldn't have done this without my bestie. - Bye, honey. - Bye. Told you. Easy peasy. Now we match. We just need dad and we'll be one big, happy donating family. Hey, I'm looking for the extraordinary little lady who put this whole thing together. You made it. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Come on, Hailey, we gotta post it on the Insta-picture story. I totally forgot. I will be right back. 'Hey, can someone send a nurse back over to my dad?' - She's a good kid. - She really is. You know she gets that from me, right? Really? I was thinking she definitely gets it from me. - A perfect combo? - Yeah. Perfect. I know that look. Who is he? - It's nothing. - It doesn't look like nothing. And don't you have a calculus test you should be studying for? - I'm good. - You're good? Remember not to be late for all you classes today. Yeah, I'll check my schedule. Very funny. - Love you. - 'I love you more.' - 'Good luck, okay?' - Thank you. - I'll see you later. - Okay. - Have a great day. - You, too. - 'Love you.' - Love you, too. O Rh positive. That can't be right. No, that's not right. We had them test her blood type at birth. I know I have those records. This is just a mistake. They made a mistake. She's AB negative like Carter, I'm sure of it. Okay, Hailey's medical records. They say AB negative. So how could she possibly be O Rh positive? No, there's definitely a mistake here. Mom, what's up? I'm calling an emergency family meeting. Let's meet at the restaurant after school. Should I be worried? We'll figure out together. That's not very reassuring. We'll see you later. Don't worry, honey. I'm still trying to understand what exactly you're saying. Your donor card from the blood drive it didn't match your birth records. Well, it's probably a mistake. I thought that too, so I confirmed Hailey's blood type with Blood Donor Connect, and they, they are not the same. 'I'm still confused.' 'Mom, explain this, please.' 'If my blood type now doesn't match my birth records' what does that mean? Are you telling me I'm not your daughter? Let's not jump to conclusions. We'll go to Hillside Medical, we'll get to the bottom of this. I've actually set up a DNA test and we have a meeting with Dr. Joyce, too. So that, you know, we know... If I'm really your child. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm positive there's a reasonable explanation for this. Yes. What? Yeah, sure. This is an awesome family dinner. Well, shall we order? I'm not hungry. 'We need an explanation.' Unfortunately, I can say with absolute certainty that Hailey is not your biological daughter. My God. Is there a chance that the results are incorrect? I'm sorry. - Hillside Medical apologizes... - Apologizes? And takes full responsibility. We are investigating what happened, how it happ... Can you just give us a minute please? Are they going to take me away from you? No, you are our daughter, and we love you and we are gonna figure this out together as a family. Your mom is right, okay? You understand that you are my daughter, right? But I'm not. Not really. If I'm not your real daughter, then who's my real mom? Hey, mom. Another double shift? I'm starting to feel guilty. Come over here. Come, sit. Did I wake you up? No, I just fell asleep. Yeah. Hey, can I have some of that? No. No, this is for our first real vacation. I'm keeping my promise. Twenty-five percent of everything I make is going towards our girls' trip up the coast. Another month and we'll be set. Actually, I've been doing some research. Come look. 'Wow.' Breanne, this looks perfect. Do you think we could stay there? I do. Yeah. In fact, I promise you we will definitely be staying here. - Yay. - Yay. What's this? 'We're is reaching out to the public.' 'And specifically, those with daughters' born on December 29th, 2003 and to please come and take a DNA test. You can go to their website for a list of the girls born on that date. 'Hillside will cover all expenses.' What's this about? 'They are determined' 'to resolve this unthinkable mishap.' Mom? That's my birthday. And you were born at Hillside Medical. Coincidence. I don't know. As I told the Jenkins family in all my years of working at Hillside Medical 'an error of this magnitude has never occurred.' What do you expect us to do? Just swap daughters? - 'This is ridiculous.' - 'I understand you're afraid.' - No one is taking my daughter. - 'No.' No one is taking your daughter. This meeting is simply to allow both you and Mrs. Jenkins 'to meet your respective biological daughters.' And since we are all in uncharted territory we have arranged for Susan Messer 'our on-staff family counselor' 'to help us navigate the difficult emotions' 'that this event has inevitably stirred up.' 'The first step is an open discussion' about all of the possible options. 'Ms. Messer will act as a mediator of sorts. Make sense?' Where was the nurse who was on call that day? Nurse Cameron passed away a few years ago so we were unable to determine what may have happened. Susan? After speaking to my colleagues and taking in to consideration the girls age 'and level of maturity' 'we feel the healthiest course of action' is to let your daughters decide where they wish to reside. - 'What?' - 'I'm sorry.' Let our daughters decide? They're just children. So how do you expect them to make that kind of decision? I assure you, their happiness and well-being 'is our primary concern.' 'The girls would spend an agreed upon amount of time' 'in their biological parents' household' 'allowing them to acclimate and make an informed decision.' You make it sound so clinical. It's not like taking a new car out for a test drive. These are our teenage daughters. Exactly. I just don't feel comfortable with this. - Mom. - What? - I-I... - What? I mean.. Well, he's ju.. 'From what I've been told, I don't stand a chance.' They're clearly are from a better neighborhood 'better school district.' It just doesn't seem fair. Susan and I will be available to you for guidance until you reach a resolution. Why don't we schedule the first visits? - You all set there? - Yeah, yeah. I was just gonna, you know, take these to the deposit box. That's not your job. I know. Barb asked me to. So I, you know, I thought I'd help. - Alexis. - I gotta go. - Hand it over. Alexis! - I gotta go. I'm late. - What? - You know what. Hand over your apron and all that cash that you stole. - What are you talking about? - You're fired. For what? I didn't do anything. Really? Well, let me count it then. Let me explain. You don't understand. No. I don't care. She's all I have and I'm losing her. That's not my problem. I have to keep my promise to her. - I have to have her choose me. - But I'm sorry, Alexis. I'm losing my daughter and I cannot handle that. Alexis! I don't even know what you're talking about. I think maybe taking all these extra shifts has taken a toll on you, but you're not making any sense. - So give me back my money. - Get your hands off me! Fred? Fred? Fred? God. What have I done? Is she doing okay? She's pretty weirded out. Yeah, we all are. You've been so busy being strong that I don't think you've even processed how crazy this whole thing is. I'm just putting my daughter first. Our daughter. Well, I guess that's not true. - She's not our daughter. - And that's my fault. Because I insisted that we take the DNA test? - I didn't say that. - What would you rather us do? Just live a lie for the rest of our lives? The lie was working, Brooke. We were happy. The truth on the other hand is what's destroying this family, that's all it's doing. I know, but this is our new reality 'and it's gonna be the hardest thing' that we've ever had to go through. But how have we gotten through every other challenge in our life? Together. Together. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, too. Did you just get home? You scared me. Yeah, we were just, we were so busy tonight. 'Mom. Are you okay?' - What? - You're shaking. Yeah, no, I, I was going, going, I didn't eat anything today. - But yeah, I'm totally fine. - Mom, you need to slow down. - Okay? - Yeah. It's okay. - I'm fine, honey. I'm fine. - Okay. Yeah. You know I would do anything for you, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - Right? - Anything. - Of course, yeah. Okay. What are you doing up? Go to bed. - It's so late. - I love you. I love you, too. - Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. 'So this is the backyard.' 'my God. You guys have a pool.' Wow. This is like something out of a magazine. Really, this place is amazing. That prunus nigras? It is. That is impressive. Yeah. - You like plants. - Yeah. Botany is kind of my passion. Mine too. 'Wonder where that comes from.' Thanks for meeting me. I hope this place is okay. Yeah. Actually, this is one of my mom's favorite spots. I mean, you know, my other.. No, Brooke will always be your mom. But now you have, like, a new mom. - Or I don't know, a friend? - Yeah. - Whatever you decide. - Right. What can I get for you? May I please have the chicken salad with no tomatoes? I'm allergic. I will also have the chicken salad with no tomatoes. I'm also allergic. Like mother like daughter, right? My whole life I always wanted to know who my real dad was. Here you are. I can't imagine how hard that was for you. - And my real mom. - Of course. What? You look so much like John. My dad? Yeah. Who is he? Where is he? Well, unfortunately he, he died before you were born. Car accident. Yeah. I'm sorry. I am finishing up a project at the Hillside Community Center. I'd love for you to come down and see what I do every day. Seriously? I mean, that would be amazing. Yeah, and if you and Alexis are free tomorrow we'd like to host the barbecue. - I'd like that. - Good. Okay. You guys need a refill? - Yes, please. - Okay. - Yes, please. Thank you. - Thanks. Alright, I'll be back. How old were you when you had me? Just slightly older than you. Was too young. I was pretty lost. Very lost, actually. I was not happy. I'm sorry. It was my first year of community college. I was on the volleyball team and he was my assistant coach. Another thing I'm not proud of. But then I knew, I knew that you were meant to come into the world, and when you did, I suddenly had my purpose. My purpose is to be a mother. Honestly, that is all you need to know. How did it go with Alexis today, honey? I had so many questions, but.. I don't know, she didn't really wanna talk about it. Maybe it's hard for her to talk to you about it. You know what I mean? He was her assistant volleyball coach at her community college. But that's all I know. It's not like I even knew him. - What if I talk to her? - No, mom. - Please don't. - Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. I mean, other than that she was cool. I told her I wanted to get to know her better. Good. But I feel guilty. Almost like I'm betraying you. No. No, no, no. Don't do that. We're all in this together and we're all doing the best that we can. So no guilt. How about you? Did you like your real daughter? Baby, just because she is my biological daughter doesn't mean that you... aren't my real daughter. Okay? Well, you know what I mean. I do like her. And I think you will like her too. I love you, sweetheart. I love you, too. 'No results?' 'Yeah, I don't know. I just thought it could be fun.' Yeah, no, no, of course, honey, we'll go. We can go to the barbecue. - Great. - Yeah. Hey, did you know that she's a landscape architect? - How cool is that? - Yeah, that is pretty cool. - Right? - Yeah. But does she know that your favorite sandwich is a BLT? - Extra B and no crust? - She does not. - But I do. - Yes, you do. - Yes. - Okay, I don't wanna be late. Okay. Yeah. Okay. - Bye. Love you. - Bye. Love you. Um, by the way, I just want you to know I'm-I'm not gonna be around like this much longer. What are you talking about? You know, they're only gonna keep the coffee shop closed for another couple days because of Fred's accident. So, it's true, he really just slipped. Yeah, that's what the police think. My guess is, they're just too lazy to do the paperwork. Nick, please. But on the bright side, I can go to the barbecue tomorrow. That's true. - Hey, I love you. - Love you, too. - Bye. - Bye. Picked up some extra shifts. Hope it helps out. Yes. 'This is really nice.' 'I'm glad we're taking the time to get to know each other.' 'Yeah, well, if there's one thing for sure' 'in all this confusion' we'll definitely be seeing a lot more of each other. - Yeah. - I look forward to it. - Yeah. - Alright. See ya. Hey, Alexis? I'm sorry, there was just, um.. One thing that we didn't get a chance to talk about. Hailey shared with me what you told her about her birth father. Yeah, yeah, there's, there's not much to tell. She just wants to know as much as she can. Right, I understand, that's totally natural. So did a little research, you know, online. And, you know, the thing is there wasn't anything about a-a death of a coach at Aniston Community College that school year. Really? Well, you know, he was just the assistant to the coach. So maybe Google didn't catch that little detail. Got it. Yeah. But, you know, I would absolutely be happy to tell her any stories about her father next time I see her. That would be really great, yeah. She's just, you know searching for some kind of connection. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Of course. Yeah. I gotta.. Alright. - Yeah, I'll see you later. - I gotta go. Okay. - Enjoy the rest of your day. - Yeah. - 'Alright. Thank you. Bye.' - You, too. What are you up to, Brooke? And you're positive that John Beckham was the only assistant volleyball coach that school year? Positive. And he didn't die in a car crash either. He just up and quit one day. He wanted to start over anew. Broke a lot of hearts. - He's alive? - Yeah. I talked to him not too long ago. He needed a letter of recommendation. I guess he's gonna start coaching again. Do you think I could get his contact information? Unfortunately I can't do that. Right. But look, given your circumstances I can tell you that he is coaching at Rossmore Junior College. That's in Northern California. 'Thank you.' - I hope it helps. - It does. Listen, I was about to go for a run. - Can I walk you out? - 'Sure.' Thanks again. Bye. Nice to meet you. Jesus! Alexis? - What did you say to her? - What? - What did you say to her? - I told her the truth. Now, look, maybe you should tell me exactly what's going on here. I have no idea what you're talking about. Everything I've ever worked for has been to protect my daughter. And I will continue to do that... at all costs. Do you understand me? Alexis, I don't know what you're involved in. But you know what? I don't wanna know. So if you'll excuse me, I gotta go. Why would Alexis lie about him being dead? She must have a good reason. We don't know anything about this guy. I mean, do you think she told Breanne the same lie her whole life? We shouldn't jump to any conclusions before we talk to Alexis. My dad is alive and I wanna know why she lied about it 'to me and to Breanne.' Can you just be patient, honey? Just-just for today. 'Because it should be about you and Breanne.' Yeah, I agree with your mom. Not today. Hold off just-just for today. We gotta get that. - Love you. - I love you. So... there's no one. Okay, there's one. His name is Jake Matthews. 'I knew it.' The real question is does he like you back? I heard he might, but I don't know. 'Well, it looks the girls are getting along great.' Yeah, like sisters. We were hoping they would hit it off. I mean, I don't need to pretend to be perfect but I'd like to think I've done an okay job with her. You've done an incredible job. Yeah, you really have. And you guys, I mean you've raised an incredible young woman with Hailey. I just want you to know, I will always be in her life no matter what she decides. I can't imagine what it must be like to have a dad and a mom, a real family. So, you never got to meet your dad? Or our dad? No. He died before we were born. You never tried to find him? Find him? I just said he was dead. Right. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. It's okay. I guess this is what they mean when they say dual income household, right? Two gainfully employed professionals working together? Yeah, we are very fortunate. Sure it wasn't easy doing it alone. It's, yeah, well, it's been... challenging. Challenging. For the record, I contribute to the household, too. Hey, why don't you slow down a bit, babe? I just think it's funny. How much you love playing the grieving widow when the truth... - That's enough. - Do not interrupt me. 'Nick, settle down.' 'Hey, Breanne, honey, it's time to go.' - 'Say your goodbyes.' - Why? Don't worry about why. - I'm so sorry about him. - Am I making you uncomfortable? He still gets jealous of a man who died before Breanne was ev... He's not dead, Alexis! Why can't you... Shut up! Mom, what is he saying? - He's drunk... again. - I'm not drunk. Is he telling the truth? Tell her. It's her father for God's sake. Why are you doing this? Why don't we just stay calm? Mom, tell her what you told me. Not now, honey. Hailey, what are you talking about? It wasn't supposed to come out like this. We're sure that you have your reasons. We found John. Alive. Breanne. Honey. Try to understand. Your father was not a good man. He-he didn't want me to have you so I, I pretended he was dead to protect you. To protect me? What else have you been protecting me from? Nothing. Nothing. Please, come back to the house. - I will, I'll explain it. - No! I am staying here. How could you do this? Hey, hey, it's okay. No, get away from me! I'll be in the car. Alexis, I'm so sorry... Don't! Don't be sorry, Brooke. Admit it, this is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? It's kind of perfect actually, right? Make me look like the worst mother ever so you can take both of them. And I lose everything. No, Alexis. We want the girls... Exactly, you want the girls. And you always get what you want, don't you? Alexis. Alexis, wait. - I'm sorry. - She's not coming back. You don't know that for sure. - She chose them over me. - For tonight. And Hailey, Hailey does not want anything to do with me after this. Why? Why? Why did you have to come tonight? It's my fault. I'm sorry. My God. I've made so many excuses for you. I've made excuses to myself, I've made excuses to Breanne. How have I not left you yet? You're blowing things out of proportion... No, I am not! We are done. I want you out. - Alexis... - No, get out of my car! Go! Wow, okay, okay. - Come in. - Hi. - Thanks for the PJs. - Yeah. It's one of the nice things about having another teenage girl in the house there's plenty of stuff to share. That's true. Would it be okay if I stayed a little longer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll just have to talk to your mom first, you know? I did speak with the principal and he knows that you're coming to school with Hailey tomorrow. And if after tomorrow, you'd like to stay longer.. We'll figure it out. I, I don't really know what I want. I just know that I, I feel safe here. Good. You are. I love you, baby. I'll be better for you. I'll be so much better for you. What a day? It was just a matter of time. This whole situation would drive anybody crazy. '...died unexpectedly today' 'during his routine afternoon workout.' Wait, hold on. Can you pause it? Pause it please. '...fell to his death. Carter... I was just with him. I was just talking to him. That's a little eerie. Yeah. What is it? Nothing. It's just odd. Breanne, hey, it's mom again. Where are you? Come on, Breanne, call me back. We really need to talk. I am your mother. Breanne, where are you? Breanne, Breanne, Breanne, Breanne, Breanne, Breanne. Breanne, where are you? - Hey, you all good? - Yeah. Does everyone dress this nice every day? Yeah, pretty much. Hey, guys, so this is what's up. Breanne, this is all about you. Yes, get in. Okay. This is Breanne's first day of school and her first day as a member of the crew. Because, seriously, let's be honest any friend of Hailey's is a friend of ours. Or, in this case, sisters! Sisters switched at birth. Is that not insane? OMG, you guys are swisters. 'I am so hashtagging that.' Okay, I'll see you guys around. Bye. Swisters? - I like it. - Yeah, me too. - What's up, Hailey? - Hi, Jake. 'Hey.' This is Breanne. - What's up, Breanne? - Hi. So, Hailey, did you have fun at Braden's party last weekend? Liked hangin' with you. We should do it again sometime. Totes. - Yeah. I'm down too. - 'Cool.' - Looking forward to it. - 'Bye.' I am such a dork. - "Totes?" Who says that? - Don't worry. Don't worry. He definitely likes you. A 100 percent. And, dude, I said, "I'm down." Isn't that like from the '70s or something? - I think it is. - I think it might be. This way. Okay, here we go. Hey, love. I'm off to The Looney Bean for a coffee run. - 'Get you your fav?' - No, I'm good. Really? Passing on a mocha-macchiato? That's a first. You alright? Yeah. Yeah. I just want to make sure everything is perfect for the grand opening next weekend. If I didn't know you better, I'd think you're distracting yourself with all this work to avoid the craziness at home. Babe. So what happens now? - You have two daughters? - Potentially, yes. Which is.. It's amazing. I'm just feeling guilty, you know. I.. I can't imagine what Alexis is going through. Yeah. I'm.. Of course. I get it. But, I mean.. Ultimately, it's, it's the girls' decision, right? Yeah. And I feel guilty about that too. Stop. Wait.. Okay. This.. This is kind of morbid, but... what about custody if something were to happen to you and Carter? I don't know. I really haven't thought that far down the road. I'm-I'm sorry. - Yeah. No. Too many questions. - No, no, no. It's important. We're gonna meet with Dr. Joyce and the counselor. And I definitely will bring that up. 'Or you could talk about it right now.' I will bring you back a small macchiato, just in case. Hi. 'Sorry to bust in on your work. Are you too busy?' No, no, no, no, no. What's going on? I wanted Breanne to have some of her things. She's not responding to me. So.. So she hasn't talked to you? About what? She asked if she should could stay with us a little longer. - Of course she did. - 'I'm sorry. I really am.' I think the kids are just tryin' to you know, sort through all of this. Imagine what they're feeling, right? I do. Actually, that's all I think about. - She loves you so much. - I know that. I know she loves me. I don't even doubt that. 'Well, I wasn't..' 'You know..' I think we just have to trust that... Okay, well, you know what, I gotta get to work. So would you just give those to her please? - Of course, yeah. - 'Yeah. Thanks.' - 'I'll talk to you soon.' - Yep. Yes, it is okay. This is Breanne's first day at school. And, in this case, sisters! Yes, you guys. They are sisters switched at birth. Al, get off your phone. The new manager is cracking the whip. Breanne? Hailey? Hey, Breanne! - Hailey! - What's she doing here? Hey! Can we talk? Um, I'm gonna just wait for you inside. You're not returning any of my phone calls or texts. Please don't pressure me, mom. I-I just need time. Are you ever going to forgive me? You lied to me my whole life. No. No. Don't say that. You know I was just protecting you. I need to go. Wait, I booked our trip. - You did? - Yes! Yeah, and-and I booked that hotel you wanted and everything. How'd you get the money? You said you needed a few more months. Just, you know I.. All those extra s-shifts. Steampunk was closed, mom. What are you doing? Baby, I made a promise to you.. You know I always find a way, right? - You're lying again. - No. - What are you doing? - No, I, I booked the trip! You have to come with me. Please, you have to come.. I don't even know who you are anymore. What? I'm your mother! Breanne, I'm your, I'm your mama. Sixteen years. Sixteen years! No way! No way! No way! Two jobs, night shifts. All for you, baby. All for you! 16 years. And this is what you wanna do. You wanna leave me for her? I'm not gonna let that happen. No. No! I will not let you do that. This is not how we do this. You need me. I need you. I need you. You need me! 'Brooke..' '...I think it's time you got a new assistant.' - 'Okay?' - 'Okay.' - 'Bye, love you. Drive safely.' - 'I will.' Bye. 'Hey, Viv.' You know, you shouldn't be riding at night. It's very dangerous. 'Crazy people out there.' Hey, go! Go! Just collateral damage. - Workin' on a Sunday? - Yeah. - We are in the home stretch. - Wow! Well, you know what you've done with the place, it's.. It's inspiring. 'It's kind of amazing.' That's really sweet of you. Thank you for saying that. Yeah, well, it's true. Anyways, um.. Here you go. From Dr. Joyce. Mediation papers, I think. Honestly, I was too upset to read them. I'm miserable, Brooke. I don't know how to be without her. Geez. Come here. Come sit. Okay. - Are you okay? - 'I have to be.' I mean, Breanne made her choice. And Hailey.. Well, Hailey, you know.. Let's be real. She's not gonna want to leave her perfect family to come and live with an unemployed waitress. - So.. - What do you mean unemployed? They, they're doing this big remodel and I'm just.. I mean, it's a joke. A week's notice that's all they gave me. They had the gall to say I could come back. But what do they expect me to do? I'm just not gonna make it two months without income. Alexis.. I'll be honest, this has been the worst week of my life. I lost my daughter.. I lost my job. I'll probably lose my house next. But, my God! I'm being a such a baby.. - You know, this is... - No, but I'm a fighter. I will pull through this. - It'll be okay. - Can I help you? No. No. No. You've done so much. You've been so generous. Well, no, listen, um.. My assistant.. God, this is crazy. She.. She got into a bike accident yesterday. - A, a hit and run. - My God. Is she okay? Yeah, considering, you know, it was.. - Do they who did it? - No, they don't. They don't know. How about you, you fill in for her while she's gone. You know. At least get me through the opening. - 'Cause I can use the help. - I don't know what to say. I mean, I have a few shifts left at Steampunk but I'll make it work. I won't let you down. Thank you. - Okay. Perfect. - Thank you. That's really funny. 'So, Breanne, what did you think of the school?' Everyone was really, really nice. It was a lot different than my school. - But I felt like I belonged. - 'That's because you do.' Hashtag Swisters! - 'Swisters.' - Yeah, I saw that. What-what is that? Sisters switched at birth, which is us. - 'This is..' - Very clever. 'That's a pretty necklace.' It was in the box of things that my mom gave you. I got it for my sweet 16. You know she's welcome here whenever you want, okay? Thank you for that. 'Yeah, she's still your legal guardian.' 'Absolutely.' Speaking of which, we'd like to discuss something with you girls tonight. We decided that if anything were to happen to your father and I Alexis should be your legal guardian. Why? Is something wrong with you guys? - No, absolutely not. No. - 'No, no, no.' - We're good. - 'No, we're-we're fine.' We're fine. 'She is your biological mother.' And she did raise you. So we think that this just makes sense. Will she be able to afford to raise both of us? Well, she would move in to the house here with you two. This conversation is starting to freak me out a little bit. As your parents we want to make sure that we're prepared for all possible scenarios. You guys talk about everything, don't you? - No secrets. - 'Nope.' 'Who wants dessert?' - I do. - 'Yes.' - 'Okay.' - She can't have any. - She can't have any. - 'Why not?' Well, we're all getting some. One, two and.. - 'We're gonna have some..' - Yay! You guys too. 'Cause it probably tastes better than mine. - Alright, swisters. - 'Alright.' Are you sure you really want to do this? Yeah, what's the alternative? Breanne grew up believing her father was dead. Hailey wants to know who her real biological father is. We have to do this. What if, what if he left her for a reason? I mean.. What if he wants nothing to do with her? Well, then, this is how we're gonna find out the truth. Don't you want to know? Honey.. You're always gonna be Hailey's father. Okay. Well, let's.. Put the ball in his court. - No pun intended. - Okay. Hey, Carter! 'What's up?' What? Who the heck would do that? Mom! You have to call the police. I'll handle it. You girls get to school. That's so messed up. Breanne.. Breanne? Yeah, I'd like to report a vandalization, please. 'Sure, I'll hold. Thank you.' I just thought it'd be weird to bring this up on your first day tomorrow. 'That's why I came here.' 'In the case of the untimely or accidental death' in addition to custody, we'd also deed you the home and a portion of our savings to supplement your income. Why are you doing this? 'Well, both of our parents are getting on in years' and considering our extraordinary circumstances we just think it's the right decision. Right. You don't have to decide right away. I don't-I don't even know what to say. I mean.. It's such a generous gesture. Well, like I said, I can just have our attorney draft up a contract and send it over to you when you're ready. What are you doing? My car got vandalized last night so I'm just calling a car real fast. You know what, actually, I'll just drive you. No. I.. It's actually... No, cancel that. - Done. - Wow. I'll drive you on my way to work. But I just got to go change real fast. - Thanks. - Yeah. Hang out, make yourself at home. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. - Nick, I thought you left. - 'I'm almost done.' I'll be back after work with the last of my stuff. - I quit. - What? I'm starting a new job, assisting the most successful landscape architect in the city. - When did this happen? - Jealous? Bye, Barb. Alexis, don't do anything.. '...you might regret.' Hey, guys, we're here at the community center with my mom.. - Our mom. - Yes. 'and we're excited to see you' at the grand opening this weekend. - So exciting! - 'Is that okay?' - 'Yeah.' - 'Okay.' Here we go.. 'I know you're in here somewhere' 'I know you're in here somewhere' Aha. 'I'm here for the rest of my stuff.' What are you.. Whoa, hey! - Hey, that thing's loaded. - I know. I was hoping you could show me how to use it. - Why would I do that? - No reason. 'Alexis, I know things aren't great between us' but if somethin' is goin' on, you know you can tell me, right? - Of course. Yeah. - Good. I don't want you to get in trouble without me. Never. It's all in place, you know. - What's all in place? - The living trust. Now I just have to execute it. 'Come on! This is a mistake.' This is a mistake. No, Nick, you're the mistake. Never mind. 'Alexis, I can't let you do this.' I can't let you do this! 'Nick..' 'Honey?' Who are you calling? - Just check-checkin' my texts. - Were you? - Why would you do this? - Alexis, you need help. Really? Yeah. I definitely need help. I chose you as a boyfriend. - You're not gonna shoot me. - I know that. I'm not gonna shoot you because I'm not that stupid. '911.' My boyfriend and I were.. 'I think he broke his neck.' - 'Hello.' - Look, sweetie.. Thank God you answered. I don't even know what happened. There's been an accident. I chased after him, but he tripped and he fell and.. Okay. Like I told the police.. We were just having this argument and he ran out the door 'and I chased after him, but then he tripped and he fell.' 'And I don't..' I don't even know what happened. And then he.. It's just.. All I can see is him just falling down the stairs.. How can I ever go back there? You know what, don't worry. You can stay here until you figure out a plan, okay? No, I can't do that. That's-that's way too much, no. No, it's not a problem at all. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm gonna get your room ready. You must be hungry. Girls, can you get Alexis something to eat? No, no, no. I mean, I'm.. I can't eat. Thank you though. Well, I'll just grab your towels then. We're here for you. Honey, I swear I promise I'll-I'll be out in a few days. Mom, don't be ridiculous. Stay as long as you need. Why do I keep losing the people I love? You haven't lost me, mom. Really? I have missed you.. So much. Maybe tonight happened for a reason. Maybe.. Maybe I'm supposed to be here. Maybe. Um.. I should get to bed. It's getting late. Okay. You're all set up here. I don't know what I would do without you. Goodnight, Alexis. Night. You know I feel for Alexis, right? What? Well, it's just, a lot have happened. 'Yeah.' I think she's handling it pretty well. - Like, a little too well? - What do you mean? All these tragic events have happened and as a result she has a great job, she's under our roof 'she's closer to the kids than ever.' - What are you saying? - Are we being naive? I mean, it's just temporary. You know. Don't make too much out of it. Okay? - Okay. - Let's get some sleep. Only temporary. - Good morning. - Morning, girls. - Morning. - Morning. - Hope you like scrambled. - Wow. I can't remember the last time when someone made me breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. What is that foreign scent wafting from our kitchen? - That's very funny. - 'Hey, baby. Here you go.' Made your favorite. Two eggs over easy, extra runny. - Thank you. - 'You're welcome.' - Looks delicious. - 'Thank you.' Hailey, honey, how do you like your eggs? - Over medium, please. - 'Over medium, please.' - 'Carter, how about you?' - Also over medium. - Great. - Okay, I place my vote now. Alexis stays for as long as she likes. 'Alright, I second that.' - 'Come on, mom.' - 'Yeah, both of you.' 'Get in here.' 'Including my hand right there.' - 'Here it comes.' - 'Okay.' Thanks. - I love it. - Cool. - Yeah. - Thanks. Hello? I totally forgot. One second, please. They're installing a pool filter at the house and need somebody to open up the back gate. - 'Can you handle that for me?' - Yeah. - Thank you. - 'Absolutely.' Hi, I'm-I'm sorry. Um, no need to reschedule. My assistant is on her way. Thank you so much. Okay, and I can stay here for the last delivery. - 'Supposed to be here at 7:00.' - And that's everything, right? 'I need to call the gardeners and confirm them' make sure they'll be here to plant them in the morning. That's everything. Okay. 'Okay. great. I'll see you later.' - Okay. - Thank you for everything. Absolutely. Shoot. How'd that happen? 'Get away from me!' Your mom is killing it. - She's such a pro. - Yeah, she is. You know, she's got a lot of good things to say about you. She says you're doing really well. - That's so nice. Hey! - Hi! Honey, why didn't you answer your phone? I must've left it in the car. I was just chased by a man in the parking lot. Are you okay? Should we call the police? - No, I-I'm fine. I'm fine. - Did you see who it was? No, it was, it was dark, and it happened fast. Are you sure you don't want me to call the police? Yeah. I'm fine. It just, it freaked me out. Well, you've also been really stressed out with the opening coming up. Maybe just chill. Take a bath. Yeah. Also we made you a plate. Yeah. That's very sweet of you guys. Thank you. I think I do need to, um, chill. Yeah. A hot bath would do you wonders. Yeah. - Thanks, guys. I love you. - 'I love you.' I'll check on you in a few minutes, okay? Okay. 'Hello, Brooke, it's John Beckham.' 'We need to talk about Alexis.' 'Can we meet in person?' 'Please call me back.' - I want that one. - 'That one..' I'm really glad that you made it. I mean, I may not be able to do much right now but I would have to be dead to miss this. This is as much your day as it is mine. Come here. I don't know what I would do without you. - Or you. - Hey! - Hey. - 'Viv, this is Alexis.' She's actually been filling in for you. Well, you know, trying to. But from what I hear, that's absolutely impossible. Well, you're too kind. - Hey. - Hi. Hey. 'Thank you all for coming to our official grand opening.' 'For a very long time, our community' 'had a feel need to find support in itself.' 'A positive place to come and interact' 'swim, relax, to come together.' And that is why we feel the time for this center is now.. For today and for many tomorrows to come. - 'Whoo!' - Whoo! And just, um, one last thing. I couldn't have done any of this without my assistant and best friend Vivian. Thank you. And, um, a special thanks to my new friend, Alexis Stern who stepped in when I needed her most. 'Thank you, Alexis.' Like I said, this has been a team effort the whole way. Now where did I put those giant scissors? Mayor, would you please do the honors? And Hillside Park is officially your park. - Yeah! - Whoo-oo-oo! Okay, so what's the big news? Actually, the development team for Hotel Vista 'approached me today about designing an outdoor workspace.' - That's.. - Congratulations! You're killing it. Okay, so now would be a good time for you to take that quick getaway before you dive into your next project. - A getaway. What, you and me? - 'Yeah.' - Is that even a possibility? - That would be nice. 'As your temp assistant' I went ahead and did the prelim work on this.. And voila! 'Look at that. It's an Airbnb not too far from here.' I would absolutely hold the fort down while you're gone. - I love it. What do you think? - 'Right?' Yeah, I think we need a vacation. - 'It's really beautiful.' - 'That is pretty.' - I want to go.. - No, no, no, no, no. Adults only on this vacation. No kids allowed. - 'Cheers to that.' - Well, it has three bedrooms. - So, we could share. - 'Yeah. Yeah.' 'I had the car upfront.' Yeah, but you have to stay and give me.. No, no, no. No, no, no. Well.. It's definitely official. We are leaving tomorrow for two nights. - Thank you for the suggestion. - Good. I'm glad. - No problem. - You're okay with the girls? Yes. Absolutely. It'll be totally fine. - Mom.. - Trust me. What time are you guys leaving tomorrow? Um.. Probably early. But don't worry, you guys, it's just for two nights, so.. You know what, we didn't get enough pictures at dinner. Everybody, line up over there. No, it's so beautiful right now. This is your night. Come on. You're gonna make bright and gorgeous, right? Okay, everybody, over by the pool. - 'Come on. Come on.' - 'Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.' You can never have too many pics. - 'You should get in here.' - 'Well, thank you.' Well, tonight's your night, so, right now. 'Well, that's very kind of you.' - 'Okay. Alright.' - 'Alright. Everybody..' 'Message not received?' 'Yeah. Yeah. Alright.' 'That's great. Are we all ready?' - 'I'm ready.' - Excellent. Smile! 'Cheese.' - Cheese. - Yeah, we're pretty lucky. I loved them. Put it right over there. 'Switch it. Do it. Switch it.'- '' 'Got it.'- '' Down. Put it down, and then up. Why is this a thing? - Wow. - My Goodness. Not bad. It's more magical than the photos. I think so. - Well.. - Yeah. Maybe we extend this trip and stay an extra night. - Maybe. - Maybe. Do you hear that? - What? - Quiet. Peacefulness. Nature. You realize I can lose my mind. - I'm counting on it. - Really? Let's check it out. Okay, what's the code? Bap, bap. There we go. - Nice. Wow! Memorized. - After you, madame. Right. It-it's so cute in here. So I was thinking we could start with a long hike and a picnic at the top of the mountain and catch the sunset? What do you say? I say, that sounds perfect, there's just one thing that I need to do. No, absolutely not, we agreed no work. Well, this will be a, um indoor physical activity. I'm in. - Hey. - Hi. Here you go, made your favorite. For you too. - BLT, but no T. - Ooh. Perfect. Thank you. So, any plans today? - Um, just chillin'. - 'Chillin'?' What, are you guys like, 90? It's Saturday. When I was your age, the last thing I wanted to do on a Saturday was be home. We could go see that new romcom that just came out. OMG, that's supposed to be like crazy funny. OMG? Really? No, it's supposed to be hilarious. - I agree. - You guys should go. - Definitely. Go. - Yeah, let's go. Okay, I guess I'll check show times. - Okay, love you, guys. - Thank you. - Love you. - Bye. Life is so much less stressful when we're off the grid. Yeah. Give me a break, I know you're dying to check-in. I'm sorry. I miss the girls. Okay, what do you say we do one last check-in, then phones off so we can be totally present together. Deal? You're amazing, and that's a deal. Thank you. Meet me in the Jacuzzi for mimosas. Yes, sir. That's my girl. - Hi, mom. - Hey, you guys having fun? My... 100%, yeah, I, like.. Five hours has already gone by since we saw you and, you know, I have expected to get some texts from you two but, you know, apparently you're carrying along without us. Um, isn't this supposed to be your time to focus on yourself? - Come on, mom. - That is true. And we are, we are. What are you guys up to? About to head to the movies. With boys? With Alexis, mom. Okay. Great, so everything is.. Goin' good there. - Yeah. - Yeah, all good. Okay, now is the time that we say goodbye until the morning and you guys enjoy your alone time. Right, goodbye. - I love you guys. - Love you too. - Bye. - Bye. - Movie time. - Movie time. - And extra large popcorn. - And add a large... - An extra large. - Okay. - Like, so much of popcorn. - So much popcorn. - Hey. - Mom, you okay? I don't know, I mean.. It's-it's either something I ate or I'm coming down with something, but.. Seriously? Is there anything we can do for you? I don't.. Maybe we should just cancel the movie. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not ruining your Saturday night, you guys go. Are you sure? I mean, what if you need something? I'll be fine, some antacids and some bad reality TV, totally fine. - Mom, I feel bad. - Don't. Don't. I want you guys to enjoy yourself, please, go. Go. Okay, well, text us if you need anything. Okay? We can be home in 20 minutes. Honestly. That is so sweet of you, thank you. But I'm a big girl, I can handle myself. - So, go, please, I insist. - Okay. - Okay, feel better. - 'Thanks.' - Bye. - 'Bye.' - Come, darling. - Ooh! 'Mom, you up here?' 'I forgot, I need to borrow cash for the movie.' - What are you doing with that? - It was Nick's. - I-I just feel safer with it. - Are you kidding me? You're gonna get us both kicked out of here. - You need to get rid of that. - I'm so sorry. You're right, I-I-I should never have brought it here. I'll get rid of it, first thing in the morning. I promise, I promise. You are ruining everything. Breanne. How are the girls? They are wonderful. They're great, they're gonna go to the movies. - 'And your phone?' - It's inside. Far away. Good. Check it out. Cheers. Cheers. Do you think we trusted Alexis too much? - Here we go again. - No, I'm being serious. She lied, she lied for.. 16 years. To protect Breanne. Do you think that maybe the living trust was a mistake? I mean, I know we felt like it was the right decision at the time on top of my feeling responsible for everything that happened to her but we just don't know her, you know we don't like really know her. Honey, please. You're obsessed. Hey.. Can we just please be here? With me. And just relax. It feels so good. - It does feel good. - Yeah. Wow. You are too quiet. - So. - 'So..' - Are you excited about prom? - I am. - 'Like beyond excited?' - Yeah, like beyond excited. I have my dress picked out, I know how I'm doing my hair. 'Do you know what you're wearing yet?' Honestly, I'll probably just figure it out last minute. That's how I do everything. What is that guy doing? - 'I don't know.' - 'What does he want?' I have no idea. Is he drunk? He's definitely following us. We're closer to the house now, I'm not gonna let this guy follow us to the movies, we should go back. 'Yeah.' - Let's just get home. - Okay. 'I think we lost him.' - 'Are you sure?' - Yeah. - That's weird. - What? - Nothing, let's just get home. - Okay. Why was that guy following us? That was really, really scary. I know, I-I have no idea. Okay, let's-let's just get inside. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ooh! - My God. - That was crazy. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Hold my hand just for a little while. - You're good, right? Okay. - Yeah. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Lock the door, lock the door. Lock the door. I got the door locked, okay, okay. My name is John Beckham, I'm Hailey's father. - What? - I just need to talk to you. I'm not trying to scare you. I'm here to save you. - What? - From Alexis. She's a very dangerous woman. Please, I just need a little bit of your time. 'I just wanna talk. Just give me five seconds.' 'Open the window, I'll explain everything.' Um... okay, open the window. - What? Are you sure? - Just do it. Just do it. Thank you. Look, I know this sounds crazy. But 16 years ago she tried to kill me. She tried to kill you? - What? My mother? - Yes. I almost died, she ran me over with her car. Because I wanted her to get an abortion. We were so young, she was barely 18 I was 19, it seemed like the only option. So you're my dad. Yeah. I'm your dad. Okay, guys, this is crazy. My mother or your mother, I don't even know anymore she's inside right now, I mean.. - She's here right now? - Yeah, let's go talk to her. Wait, where's her car? Let's check this out. Stay behind me. - Alexis. - Mom. I, I need to go check something. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? It's okay, I don't think she's here anyway. Mom, where are you going? God. Please, please, please, please don't be going where I think you're going. No! What are you doing? - I'm gonna go check. - Yeah. That's good. Breanne. - Okay, okay, we gotta go. - What's happening? - We gotta go. - What happening? I'm pretty sure my mom's going to the cottage. - It's gone. The gun. - What is? It's gone. Nick's gun. Nick's gun is gone. It was in this house? In our house? He-ey, hey, guys, guys, can we just shelve this? - Where is she? - She's going to the cottage. I know it. We have to get there before she does. - I'll drive. - I've the address in my phone. - Now I hear it. - What? Nothing. I know, right? Well, we're empty. I should get us another bottle. Are you trying to take advantage of me? Clearly. Okay. I lived with this woman for my entire life. How can I not know what a monster she is? It's not your fault, it's not your fault. I'm sorry. - Was that the front door? - I don't think so. But you know, in these parts it might be a bear or something. Well, would you be my hero and go check it out? You bet I will. - Be brave. - Yes, ma'am. Don't you go anywhere. Hello? Big bad bear comin' to get ya. 'I'm tellin' you it was no accident' 'I saw the whole thing.' She dragged him down the stairs 'snapped his neck with her bare hands.' Why didn't you call the police? I didn't have any evidence. How was I supposed to explain why I was there? Carter! Carter! Carter! Answer me, Carter! My God! What.. I was a good mother, Brooke. And you took that from me. We took you into our home, I gave you... - That is not enough! - Please. When those girls look at you, they see mom. - Me, liar! - No, they love you! 'Try calling them.' 'I can't believe this is happening.' 'You've reached the voice mail of..' Why would she do this? Let me just, let me just call for some help. My God. Everything is gonna be fine. Everything is gonna be back to normal again as soon as you and your picture perfect hubby are dead. And you know what? - He's not far off. - Think of the girls. Alright? I will take care of them. I will be there for them. When they discover that you and him have been murdered in a random but very violent robbery homicide. Alexis, your daughter chooses to come stay with us. The living trust, it grants you everything. You have the motive here, think about it. I have thought about it. What are you talking about? Please, just answer the phone, please. You've reached the voice.. Both of their phones are still off. - I never signed it. - What? I knew you'd assume that I would sign it. I mean, it's such a sweet deal, I'd be an idiot not to, right? But you never even opened the envelope, did you? That's what I thought. So then when the police accidently discover this document signed by you and that guy that gives this girl everything they're gonna say, "Ms. Stern, were you aware that the Jenkins "entrusted their entire home, their two beautiful children and the majority of their savings to you?" And I'll say, "What? I had no idea!" '911, what's you emergency?' 'We believe there's someone armed' 'and dangerous at 1023 Fallbrook Lane!' 'And then me, my two beautiful daughters' will live in your beautiful house spending your beautiful money until death do us part. Well, you're just forgetting one thing. What is that? I will do anything for my daughters. - Alexis, put it down! - John! What are you.. No, girls. I-I'm sorry, I can explain everything, okay? It's all her fault! Dad! Police! Freeze! Stay down! Don't move. - Cuff her. - Stay right there, don't move. No! Honey, I was a good mom to you, sweetie. Right? Tell them. I would've been a good mom to you too.. Let me at her! I will always be your mother. I'm fine. - Ready? - Ready. Let's do this. - Wow! - Look at you two. - Look at you. - Whoo! You look beautiful. You look amazing, I don't wanna mess you up. - My gosh. - I gotta hug ya. - Are we taking a picture? - Okay, okay, right. - Aw, you're beautiful. - I love it. Yay! Now say the ultimate modern family. The ultimate modern family. Okay, now, just the girls, just the girls. - Okay. - Ready? 'You need to get the shoes in.' Cheese. - Swisters. - Swisters. Hey, girls, ready to go? Don't wanna miss the fun. Alright. - You look beautiful, Hailey. - Thank you. You look very handsome. Okay, boys, you know the deal. Home by 10:00. - That's funny, dad. - Okay. Okay. - 10:30 it is. - Wow. - That's even funnier, dad. - Have them back by midnight. - Deal? - Deal. Feel free to send pics along the evening. - And have a great time. - Thanks, mom. - Bye, love you. - Bye. Hey, Bobby. - Okay, let's go. - Our date tonight. Our date, alone at last! Yeah.
