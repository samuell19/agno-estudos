I got things to do. So I'll catch you later. - Sure. - All right. OK, man. Hey, John. Hey, Ali boy. How you doing? Good. Your dad is in the back. OK. Hey, Dad, check it out. That a boy, Ali. We're going to see your name in lights. Al Stanco, drummer extraordinaire. That's when I retire. Take this home to your mother, all right? But I'm supposed to help you close up. No, it's all right. Tonight I close up by myself. I got a few things to do. All right? OK. You go right home to your mother. Take that. Give me these. All right. Which way? All right. There we go. Go. Get out of here. Hey. What do you got? Aw, Dad. - Ali. - Hi. Hi, sweetheart. Listen, I'm going to play the numbers. You tell your mother I'll see her later. All right, sweetheart? - OK, Aunt Rose. All right. Bye, sweetie. You're in big trouble, Ali. Why? Ali, get in here. Mrs. Rizzo called and said you and that no good Nicky Vetrino were throwing things from her roof. Is that true? [gunshot] - What was that? - That sounded like a gun. Maybe a car. I don't know. [gunfire] Ali, no! Ali! [music playing] [buzzer] [drumming] Hey, Rivera, open up the fucking door! We know you're there. MAN: How do you know? Because I show your butt ugly face looking at me out the window, that's why. MAN: He went out the back! Last chance, asshole! It's moving day. Go to him. He's at your old man's place, isn't he? I don't see why we gotta do this. Could be worse. Could be the middle of the winter. Did you see that? Right out the freaking window, man. These spics, they got no heart at all, man. I mean, we gotta send these people a message. It'll make it a lot easier for us next time. Smoke hash crack. Smoke hash crack? Can you believe this shit, man? Christ, man. Someone's gotta do something about this freaking neighborhood, man. Sweep all the shit right out, man. Oh, man! No heart. No heart. [music playing] What are you doing? Ali? What are you doing? Are you going to eat dinner, or what? No, no. I can't. I can't. No, no, look. Ali, I've got some very good news for you. Ali, I rented the upstairs apartment. That's great. That's great. We'll talk about it later, OK? No, we're not done yet. Ali? I'll see you later, all right? Ali? Wait.

It's relieving itself on the hood of your car right now. Hey, hey. Not my car, OK? What do you want, JB and water? No, a bloody Mary. Make it hot, will ya? Come on, Ali. You know I hate making them-- Oh, it's a tough life, isn't it, Louie? Hi, Ali. How are ya? How's it hanging, Eddie? Are you kidding? I can't even find the fucking thing anymore. Maybe you should put a string on it, huh? Hi, baby. Hey, sis. How you doing? Oh, I just love a man in a tux. Yeah, I guess that's why you married Louie, that frigging Fred Astaire. Watch what you're grabbing there, huh? Be careful. He's my brother, for Christ's sake. Yeah, it doesn't matter nowadays. Look at Joey and Tina Vanchi. First cousins. What happened to their kids? One's a hairy dwarf, the other one's a hairless monster. That is an ugly family, let me tell ya. You guys are sick, you know that? Yeah, we're sick. Get back in the kitchen where you belong. We're talking business here. - See you later. Gambling ain't business, Louie. Gambling? Me? Come on, baby. Don't break my balls. Sweetheart. What a pain in the ass. How was yesterday's number? How the hell should I know? It's in the paper. You've got the paper, you fucking genius. Look it up. Yeah, I think it was 107. You think it was 107? You're another big help. Hey, Louie, is Nicky around? In the corner. They're lovebirds. You're telling me shit. That's what you're telling me. - It ran late. - What ran late? What? - The job. The job? You see something you like, huh? I'm gonna rip your fucking eyes out, you cocksucker! Have the fucking money here! I'm tired of this bullshit. It's all bullshit, Nicky, OK? I'm sick of it. And don't give me no fucking bullshit! Ali boy. Give me an ear. Uh-oh. Here he goes. Watch their back, guys. It's Eddie the hat. Watch him move. Look at him. Come on. Move, baby. Hey, look at that Eddie. Come on, it's-- What do you think I'm sending you out on jobs for? You think the fucking Puerto Rican Tenants Association asked for you? You gotta find a business to go into. You understand? Danny, come on. That's a business? Throwing people out on the street like that? Hey. Hey. You know, every day you remind me more and more of your father. Well, maybe if I got to know him better, that would mean something more to me now. He was too good. He was too honest. How the hell are you supposed to make a living like that? It's fucking fantasy land. Hey, guys. Hey, Danny. Everything OK? Angie treating you good? - She's great. Good. Good. Yeah, OK. Um, hey, Danny, um-- can I have a word with you for a second? Dan, I I know I, uh-- I owe you Some money, but, uh-- I got something really solid-- you know, 500. I get off big. I really do. Solid. Solid. Thanks, Dan. Dan, I appreciate it. [inaudible] So, what do we got here? Summer meeting, here? Well, Al here ain't 100% happy about the realities of running a successful business. What about you? You got any complaints? Well, while we're on the subject, you could stand to pay a little better. Al's very sensitive. He's a musician. All right, listen up. I have a nice little piece of business coming down on Thursday. I can use a couple of guys with brains. Brains are expensive. Right, Al? For $5,000 bucks, I expect fucking genius. Who we gotta kill? Who do we gotta kill? This fucking kid don't stop, huh? Thursday. [opera singing] Her name is Gabriela. That's all I know. Yeah, well, where's she room? You got her references, or what? References? Ali, give me the olive oil, please, you know? It just don't feel right to me, Aunt Rose. Yeah, but it feels right to me. That apartment's been empty for a long time. She comes here, she gives me three months in advance, what am I gonna do? Ask her questions? That's great. Great. That's a good way to get yourself killed, is what it is. You're putting those peppers too close together. I don't think so. So what is she? Italian, Spanish, what? She's from the old country. Straight from the old county. Well, what is she doing here, then? Listen, Ali, you're so interested in this woman, why don't you just go upstairs? You ask her for yourself. Please. You gonna move those peppers, or not? No, Ali, I'm not moving the peppers. Not, not, not. [music playing] Hello? [music playing] [knocking] Hello? Oh! Jesus Christ. Who are you? I come from downstairs. You deaf, or something? I tried knocking. Did I answer? I just wanted to introduce myself. So, you must be the nephew. Al. Gabriela. Gabriela-- That's right. I live in the basement apartment. So, welcome to the neighborhood. You a photographer? No. A filmmaker. Oh, really? Well, if you're ever looking for a leading man-- well, anyway, I'm sorry I bothered you. I don't know. She says her name's Gabriela. I said, yeah, Gabriela what? She says no. I go look at the lease-- just Gabriela that's it. She says she's from the old country. She could be from Jersey, too, you know? You never so. I mean, I know it's my aunt's house, you know, and she can do whatever she wants with it, but-- I don't know. She's just-- kind of weird. How were her tits? Big, or what? Huh? Her tits-- were they big, or what? I didn't notice. Guy don't notice a girl's tits? If she ain't got none-- I mean, it's just a rule of thumb. I just don't like the idea of someone else living where I grew up, you know? Oh, who's this coming in? Par here? - You mean Parente? - Yeah, yeah. He here. - Uh, no, uh-- what do you want? When's he coming in? I couldn't tell you. Who should I say is asking for him? Never mind. I'll be back. Who was that? A cop? Drug dealer. You never know. Hey, Louie, what gives? Hey, who the fuck knows? That's why I don't like Parente hanging around here. You never know who's going to come in and shoot up the fucking joint. Come on, he's not that bad. Danny's a good guy. [music playing] Thought you might be thirsty. Look at this human display case here. You white boys get lost? Yo, the pizza parlor's around the corner. Cessie, my man. I dig that necklace, man. You look like a goddamn Aztec, or something. Fucking Montezuma. All you need is a red hat and a gong. You'd be all set. I gotta talk to you one of these days. You can talk to me now, cuz. No. What? You, me, and your machete? A nice, long talk. Anytime, anywhere, cuz. Man, his sister is some piece of ass, man. I think she digs me. I'll be right back. [music playing] And, you know, I learned when we were living way down on Grant Street, in Little Italy-- my mother told me, she said, make sure you use olive oil in everything you cook. But, you see, the reason I do all this is because olive oil is good for everything. Everything. It goes down nice and smooth, the food. And then when it comes up, it comes out on your complexion. It makes it moist-- and it's attractive to boot, right? See? All right. Now, in the morning, remember-- you have to put a drop of olive oil in your coffee with the [non-english speech]. And at night, when you go to eat the dessert, make sure you have a drop of olive oil on the ice cream. Ali. This is my nephew. Come on, Al. Al-- Ali-- come on. Come in this picture with me. Good morning, Alfonso. Get that thing off me. Hey, Gabriela's making a movie. Yeah, I know all about it. We're all going to be in the movie. Not me. I'm going to call the family for Saturday, and we're all going to get together. We're going to get you all the material you need. - Aunt Rose-- - I'm going to go call Angie. The camera likes you, Alfonso. How do you know my name is Alfonso? A little birdie told me. So, what are we supposed to do? Just tell stories about the old times. Uncle Guy, you tell the story about when you saw Mr. Botzel with a goat. - What? - Goat. The one with the bushy tail. You remember, you told him it was a pony? You remember? Come on. So, uh, you're making a movie about us? No. It's a movie about Brooklyn. It's about families, really. [inaudible] Tri Television wants to show what keeps them together. Thanks. You're talking, uh-- you're talking about the old Brooklyn, huh? I mean, it's all changed. It's not the same anymore. Some things never change. OK, so it's different? How? What do you remember? Well, um-- I remember the time Vinnie Correlli had this affair with Mr. Gumali's daughter. Yeah, in the funeral parlor, right? Right. And he took the dead guy's pants by mistake because they were doing it in the dressing room, right? And then they buried his pants, and his wallet-- everything in it. That-- that was pretty funny. Yeah, but it wasn't Vinnie Correlli. It was Augie Bonacci. No, no. No Augie Bonacci. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Augie Bonacci? He had the brother? No, the one with the hairlip? No, no, that wasn't a hairlip. That's where his wife hit him with the genoa salami. You should have seen this woman. [non-english speech] I mean, she was built like Pavarotti. She had a neck-- remember, her neck was like-- it was thicker than my waist. Ba bum, ba bum, ba bum. So, Mr. Parente, you said it's not the same. But you still didn't say how. One word, honey. Royalty. Yeah. It used to be that the whole neighborhood was, uh-- one big family. Everybody knew everybody. We left our doors open at night, our wallets on the counter. Well, those days are gone. Is that camera pointing at me, or at you? Now it's on me. But it was on you. - Her eye. Excuse me. Her eye is looking at you, and the camera's at me. Right? - Talking to the-- You looking at me? I don't know-- [laughter] She's getting me nervous. Who was I say-- oh, yeah. It used to be that the whole neighborhood was one big family. Everybody knew everybody. And, uh-- you grew up in one house. And most of the time, your kids would grow up there, too. And their kids. We all wanted the same thing. Good friends, good food-- and, uh-- good, uh-- you know what I mean. Tell her, guys. You know I'm right. And-- oh, hey, and nobody ever left the neighborhood. Of course, there was no reason to. We had it all here. We looked out for each other. Loyalty. I'm getting nervous. And I never get nervous. Anyway, uh-- well, you know what I'm saying. Right, Guy? Augie Bonacci's wife used to go into the bakery and order 2 pounds of cannolis a day. Remember that? Yeah. She used to make you carry them home for her. Yeah, I remember. Oh, Grandma Stanco's cannolis. They were the best. Those were the cannolis. Hey, whoa, Rose. Rose. Yours weren't too bad, either. You know, Ali, your aunt Rose and I, we shared a cannoli or two on a couple of those [inaudible] lazy summer nights. Now we know, eh? What are you talking about? Are you kidding me? Wait, wait just a minute. They were the best damn pastries in Brooklyn. Stop it, already. Shut up. Yeah, I remember the first time I saw Angie. She was behind the counter at the bakery. She was wearing that cute little white apron. Lots of baby fat. But that was the past. Past. We think about the future now. Right, Guy? Al, she's nice. She'd be good for ya. - Angie, please. - Hey, Al. Ali. [non-english speech] You know, we shouldn't be telling her all this stuff about our family. - Why not? I like her. She reminds me of your mother, when we first came from the old country. She's something different, Ali. Yeah, but she's not. She has nothing to do with our family. And Danny was right. Family used to be about neighborhood. People you grew up with were the only ones you should really trust. No, no, no. I don't-- no. I trust who I trust, and I don't care if she lives in my house. [non-english speech] You owe me money, and I'm giving you more, huh? I must be [non-english speech]. Don't worry, Danny. I'm-- I'm good for it. Thanks. Hey, I got a tax check coming soon. You'd better get a new line. That one's got a hair on it. Yeah. Uh, Louie, look, if you really want to pay me back, I got a proposal for you. I have some associates, uh, who need a comfortable little place to direct their business. Well, I'd consider it a favor to me if you make the bar available. You talking about drugs? Watch your fucking mouth. And show some respect. I'm talking about friends. Friends, Louie. Danny, I can't. I mean, this-- this place is my-- Give me a 77. Come on. I love these windows. Remember when Jeannie Papsadel lived next door? We used to look up her dress when she was waiting for the bus. Polka dot panties. And little curly blonde hairs on the fringe. 20 years ago, bro. I got a photographic memory. Yeah, more like pornographic. - Hey, that's good, too. - How's this shirt? Is it good? Is this-- Yeah-- it's out of fashion. Sure, it looks great. Hey, check this out, man. What? Oh, is that the girl from upstairs? AL: Gabriela. Gabriela? Sounds like a high class guinea to me. Yeah, well, she's weird is all I know. Don't matter, bro. You gotta jump on that shit, man. That's prime cut, baby. If you don't, I will. - Come on. Let's go. Piece of ass, man. That's the last of the minks. Let's go. Come on. - Hold on. What are you doing? Let 'em finish up. They'll go inside, they'll sign off with the foreman, and we'll grab 'em. I ain't waiting around here for another fucking hour, bro. Hey-- oh, you're an idiot. You're a regular freaking idiot. Nobody argues with a fucking gun, man. Yeah, except someone with a bigger one. What, do you mean like this one? [gun cocking] - Jesus Christ. What, are you fucking-- - Relax. Relax. Hey. Hey. We gotta stick together. You hear me? I look out for you, you look out for me. So let's go. Come on. Fuck me. [gunshot] Good news, guys! Quittin' time! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Yeah, baby! Un-fucking-believable. It worked, didn't it? Besides, anybody can just jump in and drive the fucking thing away. Hey. You want to get ahead in this business, you gotta make a name for yourself. [gunfire] Oh, fuck! What-- Mother fucker! [gunfire] Mother fucker! Cocksucker! What the fuck was that? One of them jerks must be stuck in the back. You're going to make a name for yourself, all right. Biggest fucking idiot in Brooklyn! Put the goddamn thing away, will ya? Yeah, what are you, my fucking mother, or what? Shit, I'm empty. Yeah, well, you'd better hope to God he is, too. Maybe I got the prick. Hey! MAN: What? You listen to me! I'm gonna open this door up further, OK? And then you are going to take off. And you're going to run your ass out of here in 5 seconds. And if you do, we won't shoot your ass, OK? Go. Come on. Come on. No! Nicky, no! Come on! Nicky, what the fuck are you doing? [shouting] Nicky! That's enough! Enough, already, all right? - Get the fuck up, huh? - No, Nicky! That's fucking enough! - You motherfucker! - No! No, no! Shrimpy motherfucker! I'll kill you! Let's get the hell outta here! Come on! Get in the fucking cab, will you? Get in the cab! No! [groaning] How do you like that? Go. Come on! Shit. Nine. 50. 50. Like I said, five grand each. When are you gonna wise up, huh? I don't need a clown for a right hand man, with blinking Christmas lights, and pinwheels sticking out of his ass. That's not in my best interest, you understand? What are you talking about? I didn't do nothing. - Yah? Then how come I got 30 mink coats with fucking bullet holes in 'em? Huh? maybe I can sell 'em as real soft toilet paper? I even gotta take a discount on the truck, which was all shot to shit, too. The next fucking bullshit stunt you pull like that, I'm not going to be sticking my knife in a fucking table. You understand? Take it. Take it. Come on, you earned it. Let's take a little walk outside. That's what you call employee management. It's the only thing he understands. He's gotta learn. He's loyal. Yeah, and he's tough, and he's street smart, but he's got no fucking brains. He's a lowlife, and he always will be. Look, I like the kid, but I ain't making no future plans with him. You're the man. - Naw. Not me, Danny. - Listen, listen. - No, no-- Hey. What are you telling me, all right? You're practical, you keep your head. You never jump before you know where you're gonna land. That's what it takes. I mean, look around. Look. Everything's changing. I mean, spics jumping off the boat every minute. Niggers marching up and down the streets like they own it. Well, the old days are over. You know that. That's OK. That's OK, though. Change equals opportunity. They all want something, Ali. You know what I'm saying? They get the money for it one way or another. Now, somebody's gotta control the flow. Why not me? Why not you, huh? Look, Danny, I know-- I know you're looking out for my best interests. I know that. I mean, you've always been there for me. But I'm not a businessman. I'm just not. You know, I got my drums. That's enough for me. Hey, fuck your drums. You can play the bongo with your dick, the kind of money you'll be making here. Listen, I promised your father I was gonna see you set up proper, and making something of yourself. So I don't want no more fucking discussion. Humor me. Together, you and me-- we're going. Danny? You got a telephone call. I'll see you here tomorrow night, OK? Yeah. Aunt Rose? Aunt Rose, I gotta run. [music playing] You know, that act with the camera's getting pretty old, OK? But I'm getting a lot of material. You're getting a lot of bullshit, is what you're getting. You'll end up with a feature length documentary on the art of bullshit. You really think they buried somebody else in Augie Bonacci's pants? Please, spare me. Some of it must be true. They was just having fun with you, that's all. They don't know nothing about the real Brooklyn. Oh, yeah? Well, you don't know anything about the rest of the world, so we're even. You're pretty good, you know? Thanks. Except you play with no passion. Well, you know, Parent has a cleaner sound. You say Parente to some of these white bread snobs, and right away they got you tied to the mob. Parent has, uh-- warmth to it. Like a mom and pop operation. I'm not going to talk into that thing, you know that? Why not? You talked that night. And did I say anything? So, now, what do you want to ask me? Well, they tell me that you are-- They? Who's they? Just the people I-- They got names? You see, that's what I'm talking about. In the old days, people would never talk shit behind your back. How do you know they were talking shit? I was born in this neighborhood, sweetheart. And while I feel a deep moral obligation to improve my own community, some people resent my methods. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's because some people are losing their apartments, and businesses? What can I do about that? That's the American way. The food chain, see? We all feed off each other. Big fish eat little fish. And you are the big fish? I ain't been eaten yet. What the hell does this have to do with your little movie? You are one of the leaders of the community. You say you don't like what's happening to it. That people shouldn't leave. But what do you do about it? What do I do about it? I take care of my own. And what if, uh-- Al wanted to leave? This is his home. This is where he belongs. But what if he wanted to? You're a very attractive woman. You know that? You know that. Yeah, of course you know that. And it just so happens that I have a weakness for attractive women. As a matter of fact, I'd do almost anything for them. So I'm gonna do something for you. I'm going to give you some advice. If you don't want to get eaten, don't swim with big fish. The interview is over. Gabriela. Bonjourno. [drumming] ROSE: Ali! Cut it out! Enough! What would you say if I asked you to do the music for my movie? Come on, I ain't no composer. How do you know? Are you afraid? Just like you are afraid to show me the real Brooklyn? Hm? What? Think I'll bite? [music playing] Somebody's going to rip that thing off. Look, listen. They are just like you. - Let's go. - No. They are wonderful. I said, let's go. What's the matter with you? You're not prejudiced, are you, Alfonso? No. I just got sense enough to know when I'm in enemy territory. That's all. What's the matter, Louie? It won't turn over. Look at this new friggin' battery. I'm ruining my manicure. I used to be a mechanic. You were? What, you didn't know that? I thought you knew everything? I want you to reconsider my proposal, Louie. Aw, come on, Danny. I can't do that. I run-- I run a clean place. I want to keep it that way. Clean fucking business? I was clean enough when you were riding on the balls of your ass, looking for a loan to get started. The money wasn't too fucking dirty then, huh? Mikey? Try it now. You're welcome. Look, Danny-- Danny, please. Come on, Danny. What are you doing, huh? Come on. It's me, Louie. I don't know who the fuck you are, but you ain't no friend of mine. And you obviously don't know the fuck I am. I'm always looking out for your welfare, Louie. And what do I get in return? Nothing. No respect. - Danny, I Nothing. No, you use me. You use me. And then I ask you for a favor. Please! You call that respect? Danny-- please, Danny. No, Danny, please! No! Please? You're asking for help? That don't seem fair, you know? When I asked you for help, you told me to go fuck myself. I mean, it's gotta be a two way street. Gotta be. - Danny, I'm family! Family my fucking ass. Angie's family. You're just a fucking leach. No. No! No! No! Louie! Louie! What, are you gonna screw around with the car all day? I got customers inside. It's all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all right, Ang. Look, we're doing a little business here. He'll be right in. Be right out, hon. I think we've got everything straightened out now, don't we? Yeah. So, what kind of music you want for this film of yours, huh? Something with drums. Well, I kinda figured that. So, how'd you get started with all this movie stuff, anyway? Hey, small freakin' world. Yeah, a little too small. Gabiriela, this is Nicky. Is this one of your prejudiced friends? Prejudiced? Who, me? I just don't like niggers. This is Miranda. Hi. How's your brother Cessie doing? Oh, he's good. As a matter of fact, he bought me this ring. You dating him, or something? I'll get you something nice, baby. I'll get you a nice ankle bracelet. She's got great ankles. So, I hear you're making movies. I could be a movie star, you know? I even hung with De Niro for a while, there. He bumped into him coming out of a restaurant. He never stops talking about it. Yeah, whatever. Excuse me. Listen, papi, I'm gonna go powder my nose, OK? Powder everything, cause I'm gonna be leaving prints. Don't miss me. What the fuck is the matter with you? What are you, crazy? I don't know who's going to cut your balls off, Donna or Cessie. I like living on the edge, my man. You know that. Besides, who's gonna tell 'em? Here. What's that? It's your half of the five from Parente. Hey-- we stick together, bro. No matter what. My man. My man. Yes. Nick is really something. I must get him on tape. Yeah, well, you'll get more than you bargained for. Believe me. And Parente? He is trouble, no? Naw. He's a good guy. And so you are going into business with him? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Sit down. Relax. You know, sometimes, late at night, I come out here, and there's nobody around. And it's real peaceful-- I start to think that maybe the world's not so bad after all, you know? Do you have a girlfriend, Alfonso? Please, enough with this interview already. Why don't you want anyone getting close to you? You know, I'm gonna start charging you by the question. I'm the one who should be asking. Now, I don't know nothing about you. Except that your-- your mother was an artist. That's all I know. What about your father? Hm? Where's he? What does he do? Tell you what-- you don't interview me, I won't interview you. Deal? Fair enough. Walk me to my door. Come on. How do you like the apartment? You know, we used to live up here. I know. Sometimes I can feel your spirit moving through the rooms. It's very restless. You know what this is, here? This is me growing up. My father used to-- he'd make a big deal about measuring me, you know? I was like, five here. Six. 10. 11. I should, uh-- Mm-mm. You don't have to go. [music playing] All right, ante up five. - Replay. - Jacks are better. Don't make any difference. He wins, anyway. This prick. What about Ali and this girl? They were out last night. He was showing her the sights. She's asking a lot of questions? Well, she's making a movie, or something. Well, maybe you'd better keep your eye on her. One. What? See what they're up to. How many? I told you, she's making a movie. Yeah, and I told you to keep an eye on her. Find out where she's from, who she's with, and what she wants. All right? Want me to check her for crabs, too, while I'm at it? Very fucking funny. - All right, all right. - What do you got? - You're the boss. - What do you got, huh? - Pair of aces. - Pair of aces? What do you got? Sixes, and a straight-- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The fuck you doing? Hey! Ali boy, come here. I want you to do a little job for me. All right. I want you to go over to [inaudible] bridge. Don't jump. [inaudible] And then the fourth-- the Groovy Groove. Make it 1,000-- - What the hell are you doing? - Hang on. I can't believe you. This is getting out of control! Excuse me, I think this is still my fucking phone. Come on! Angie's getting ready to have a baby in a couple of months, you're throwing it all away. Hey, would you mind your business? I know what I'm doing! How you doing? Hey, how you doing? Listen, uh, Mr. Parente, he'd like to start the remodeling, you know? So, uh, he'd like to get the inspections cleared up soon as possible. Yeah, it's a big job. I gotta tell you, this building don't look too good from where I'm standing. Yeah, well, uh-- do what you gotta do. All right? I'll wait for you outside. I'll have the building's safety certified by tomorrow afternoon. It's a pleasure doing business with you. All right. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood, and I thought maybe I could get a ride home. Yeah, well, you shouldn't be drifting around out here by yourself. You could get yourself in some serious trouble. How do they keep their spirit? They buy it. $10 bucks a rock. When they're all drugged up, they don't care about nothing. What are you looking at me like that for? Hey, I'm a realist, you know? You see how they live. Drug dealing, burnt out buildings. They trash their own homes. You don't see any of that in my neighborhood, do you? That's cause we have pride. And what about the mafia? Hey! My family has always earned an honest living, you understand me? Until now. Because now your uncle Danny controls everything. Whoa, whoa. First of all, he's not my uncle. He's a family friend. And you are just a stranger, so don't act like you know everything, OK? Danny's a businessman. That's all he is. But you work for him. I help him out whenever I feel the need. And that means throwing people out into the street? You don't know nothing about me. So tell me. I want to know. YOUNG AL: Hey, Dad, check it out. AL'S FATHER: That a boy, Ali. We're gonna see your name in lights. Al Stanco, drummer extraordinaire. YOUNG AL: Hey, John. JOHN: Hey, Ali boy. How you doing? YOUNG AL: Good. JOHN: Your dad is in the back. YOUNG AL: OK. Dad? AL'S FATHER: No, it's all right. Tonight I'll close up by myself. Cakes and pies. Over here. And down here, all the pastries, eclairs, Napoleons. And all the breads. [inaudible] Right here you had your cannolis. The best around. And the cookies went over here. $1.50 a pound. And you'd weigh them over here, and box 'em up. You see this? My mother used to-- you know, she used to ask Miss Savors for a-- a, uh-- tomato plant, and tie 'em up. You come back here a lot, Alfonso? AL'S FATHER: Go right home to your mother. Go, get out of here. Hey. YOUNG AL: Dad? See this? That's a bullet that missed. One out of the four. She spent hours trying to get the blood out of the tiles. Scrubbing and scrubbing. There's still a trace here and there. Didn't even take nothing. Shot my father for the fun of it. That's how they are. They? Who's they? You know. How do you know he was black? What do you think he was, an Eskimo? You just assume-- My uncle Guy was at the deli down the block. Saw the guy running away. Ran right past him. That doesn't mean-- He was black, he had a gun in his hand. Case closed. But they never caught him? The police never caught him. But he was taken care of. Oh, you sneak around like a little thief. Where's Ali? I don't know. He went out. He's coming back at 5:30. We're going to eat some scampi. You want to join us? Oh, naw. Too busy. Listen, when are you going to settle down with Donna? There's only one woman in the world for me. You know that? They don't make 'em like they used to, Rosa! [non-english speech]. You're crazy. Get outta here. You're busy? Go. [non-english speech] Tell Ali I'll give him a call later. All right. This is my past. Empty room, bare walls. Topped off with the blood of my father. I get so angry, Gabriela. I get so angry when I think about it. I never spoke to anybody like this before. It's OK. I understand. Put the others in, and then at night, when you have-- MAN: No trouble. Pay every month. And once we miss-- [whistling] What do you think? For the movie. I mean, it's still rough, and everything, but-- you know, I'm gonna work on it. It's beautiful, Alfonso. Why do you keep calling me that? It's your name, isn't it? Only one person ever called me that. Hungry? [car horn] Hey. Hey, Ali, I gotta talk to you. What's up? Not here. ANNOUNCER: They come over the top of the stretch off a half in 45 seconds flat. Brazen Prospector, and now Dances With Fire, Dancers With Fire on the outside by a head. Brazen Prospector, Ice Agent, trying to close at the top-- Pick up. Come on! Come on! Come on. ANNOUNCER: Here comes-- Come on. We got it. We got it. ANNOUNCER: Moreno. Yes. In one-- [inaudible]. He came outta nowhere. Keep an eye on the place. Hey, baby. Just need to use your VCR, OK? What? Let me call you back, all right? - If this some kinda bullshit. - Just watch. Just watch. Sit down. Sit down. What are you doing? Not now, baby, OK? Yes, now. And don't give me that baby shit. You can't just waltz in here and use my things. This street-- we live. All of us. Together. No trouble. Pay every month. But once we miss-- they throw us out. GABRIELA: Who throws you out? Parente. Street crap. And this-- this is my shit. This is the best. Fuck you up real good, baby. GABRIELA: And Mr. Parente's aware of this? Aware? Yes, I do believe Mr. Parente is very much aware. Mr. Parente? Parente? Shit. He runs the whole goddamn thing. Fucking got his fingers in everybody's pockets. You see that blood right there? Right there? That's his blood. Believe that. Nice little movie, huh? All that's missing is a scene with me, you, and Parente walking hand-in-hand to jail. Did you ever find out her last name? Maybe it's Jackson. Or Jones. I got nothing. King, jack-- ace high. Pair of threes. I win again. [inaudible]. Where'd you steal that? We gotta talk, Danny. Alone. I it's time for me to run my own business in my own way. Your business? That's right. All my life, everybody's been breaking my balls. But not anymore. I'll keep this between us so as not to embarrass you, but this is my business, and nobody's going to break my balls here anymore. You understand? There's one problem, Louie. This is my building. Yeah, well, when my lease runs out in 10 years, then you come talk to me. Oh. Until then, I'm calling the shots around here. And that don't include catering to you, or any of your scumbag friends. Hey, Richie-- get rid of that tail, huh? What's happened? I don't understand. Want you to do the music for my film? I do. Don't bullshit me, Gabriella! I already seen your film, OK? You took me for some stupid greaseball guinea who'd believe anything you told him, right? Listen to me. Now I know why you wanted fucking Danny on tape. What did you expect me to do, hand you Parente's head on a silver platter? You want me to betray my family, and my friends the way you betrayed me? Huh? Why did I trust you? Jesus Christ! That was fucking stupid. [non-english speech]. You're right about one thing-- I didn't really come here to make a movie about Brooklyn. I told myself I did, but deep down I really came here to meet you. Oh, don't give me that shit, Gabriela. OK? Don't even bother. Bam. Bam. Four. And you know when you hear shots, you go down. That's what you learn in a war. You go down. You don't try to be a hero. Curiosity killed the cat. So I go down to the floor, and I wait. And it gets real quiet, until I hear someone screaming. Then I hear footsteps coming out of the baker. Fast. So I stand up, and there he goes, running by like the devil himself. Diabolo. The black devil. I make my living talking to people. I know when someone's holding back. There is something about your father. Hey. Shut up already about my family. Keep your lying ideas to yourself. Yeah, I know why you don't want to talk about your father. All that time I was stupid enough to tell you everything. You couldn't tell me nothing. What's the matter, you can't face what you are? Because to me you're still a-- Go on. Say it. What do you think? You think I never heart it before? I grew up in this neighborhood. That's right-- just a few blocks away. I'm proud of my past. My father was a good man. A man who cared about his family, and stood by his principles. Just like yours. You don't know nothing about my father. You're wrong. You and I are so close. You were 12 when your father was killed. I was only five. We were sent to Italy to live after he passed away, until everyone forgot. My mother told me the truth just before dying. And that's why I came back here. Back to where my father was killed. You see-- they said a black man shot a white man in his bakery. So, a black man had to die in return. If it was the same black man who did it, fine. If not-- well, they're all the same, aren't they? Hm? It was my father, Ali. My father, my mother, me. We all paid for your father's death. And now just get out. I don't want to talk about this anymore. What's going on? What happened? [non-english]. Al? Aw, you mother-- dirty-- [sigh] This fucking neighborhood. [car starting] Thank you. Huh? Louie. [gunfire] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Eternal rest grant unto him, oh Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon-- Fucking Louie, man. Who would have believed it, huh? REVEREND: And the souls of all-- I always knew there would be trouble sooner or later. Those niggers are always causing trouble. It's fucked up. Louie had that big payday with the ponies. They probably found out he was carrying extra dough. Bastards. Motherfucking animals. Those We should hang them by their balls. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Come here. You got a problem with me, Uncle Guy? Huh? He was family, Danny. Family. This is the old way. This is not right. It never was. Get the fuck out of my face before I put you in a fucking-- get the fuck outta here. Get outta here. I have nothing to say to you. You're Parente's boy now. Your father's son anymore. Please, Uncle Guy. Don't give me that shit, OK? Now, who are you to talk? You've taken as much from Parente as any one of us. No, never. Not a dime I took from him. Not a penny. Not like you. Louie made that mistake, but he tried to make it right. He was a good boy. He was like your father. Too honest. He stood up to him. Not like you. What are you talking about? He pays you to be blind, doesn't he? Well, not me. I know what I see. Hey, if you're so goddamn noble, how can you just walk away? If you're so much better than him, and me, and all the rest of us, why don't you stand up to him? Tell me what you know. I want the truth, god dammit. We'd better get going. And it gets real quiet. And I hear screaming, and then footsteps coming out of the bakery fast. So I stand up. And there he goes, running by like the devil himself. Diabolo. A black devil. - Right. A black man. Black. Black. A black mask. A mask? GUY: Your father was in trouble. He wouldn't allow them to use the bakery for their purposes. Danny? What are you doing? He was an honest man, so he had to be taken care of. It's going to come get this, Danny? Danny-- we're family, Danny. We're like family, Danny. [gunfire] Poor Vincenzo. Hard head. Like cement. He wouldn't listen. Parente was paying his dues. He didn't have the courage to refuse. You knew this? All these years, you knew this? I came from the old country. It was our way. Silencio. And in my stupidity, I thought it was the right thing. Now? Now I know better. He can't do anything to me. But it's too late. I'm sorry. It's too late. Where did you get this? Uncle Guy gave it to me. He said you should have it. Where are you going? I gotta get back to the wake. This music is driving me nuts. Stop it. He was always blowing his stack about one thing or another. Sure, he'd get all pissed off-- and then an hour later, it was all forgotten. He was a good man. I'm saying right now, no matter who winds up running this place, it'll always be called [inaudible] as long as I'm around. Let's hope that's not very long. Where You been? You get lost coming from the cemetery? I've been talking to some ghosts. Louie's ghost. My father's ghost. They had some interesting things to say about you. Some gotti better get my man here a drink. He's seeing things. No, I'm seeing you real clear now. What's the matter, huh? Huh? You're acting all stupid. Well, I was just wondering-- a man who can kill his own people-- his own kind-- and then laugh and drink at their funerals-- a man that rotten-- how come I can't smell him when I'm standing so close? What's that supposed to mean? Hey, what the fuck? Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Stop it. That's a nasty cough you got there, son. You should take some medicine. What, the same medicine you gave my father? Huh? I'm a busy man, Ali. You got something to say, then say it. Yeah, I got something to say. When I'm good and ready. Why didn't I hear about these tapes? I told Ali. I thought he was your man? Is he going to talk? Sure, he'll talk. He's a fucking weasel. We gotta take care of him. He spit at you, Danny. We all saw it. Just sit there and shut the fuck up! Nicky, I want you to take care of it. Me? And the broad, too. I never liked her from the start. You gotta trust your instincts. Why are you sending me? Because it's time for you to make your bones. You know how I feel about you-- Good. Good. Then you take him out tonight. And I want you to sever his motherfucking eyeballs, and I want you to put them right here, on this table. What if he stays home? Do you need a fucking diagram? No. I don't. Nicky-- Nicky, where are you going? You know, that prick's no bargain, either. You know what I'm thinking? Maybe you should not out two birds with one stone. Cessie. Come here. Sit down. Come here. You have a sister. What's her name? Uh-- Miranda? Yeah. Yeah. Uh-- would you like to know what she's been up to lately? Yeah. She's been seeing Nicky. Naw. Yeah. That scumbag bastard [inaudible].. She has been seeing him. Some people told me. I didn't see it with my own eyes, but good people told me. You screw some [inaudible] spic and then you come back to my bed? I hope he fucking kills you. I hope he does! You hope who kills me? Your fucking brother in law, Cessie. He's coming for your ass right now. Parente told him everything. That prick is dicking us every which way. Fucking incredible, man. Come on. Let's get outta here. I'll lead him down towards Palmer Street. Give me a few minutes, then you head north, OK? I'm going to go with you. Give me a break, will ya? You trying to be a hero, Nicky? You don't worry about me, Cuz. Cause that'll be the day I run scared from some PR coke head. You be careful. You and that freaking camera. Man. Nicky! [gunfire] Stay here. Stay here! Nicky! Nicky! Nicky! DONNA: Nicky! Jesus Christ, Nicky. DONNA: Nicky! You and me, bro. Nicky! Nicky! No! No! Baby! Nicky! Nicky! Jesus Christ! Baby? Nicky! [crying] Nicky always was a useless motherfucker. At least he had a heart. It's OK. Why don't you go home and change your clothes? Come on, you're beginning to stink. Vinny. Vinny, please. Come on. So I guess that leaves me and you, huh? That's what you said the day my father died. You look a little nervous, Ali. Just sit down. Have a break. No, I don't drink with scumbags. It's a personal thing. No, I'd say that's you. You're the worst kind of scumbag there is. You sold me out. Sold me out for a little taste of pussy. And a bitch with nigger blood, no less. She's better than you'll ever be. Because you're nothing. Nothing. You're a lying, low life, gutless sack of shit. You killed my father, your own best fucking friend. I just want you to admit what you did. You sure? Oh, yeah. That's all I want. But that puts me in a very awkward position, doesn't it? [gunfire] Peekaboo. I see you. Scumbag, huh? Now look at you. Look. Look. Just like the rat bastard you are. Why don't you cut the shit, and do what you gotta do? Open your mouth real wide. I'm going to send one in. [gunshot] Don't fucking move! Aw, shit! Shit! - Don't move! Don't move! Sit down. You motherfucker. Sit the fuck down. What's the matter, Danny? You look a little nervous. Why don't you just skip the bullshit? We can make a deal here. - Oh, really? - Yeah. You know what I got going. Real estate, loan shark, and drugs. Oh, you-- I got deals going everywhere. You want in? Whatever you want. There's enough money in it for everybody. Let's just forget about all this bullshit, and we'll start fresh. I'll take good care of ya. Oh, yeah. That's right. That's right, yeah. You told my pop that you would take good care of me. That's right. But let me ask you something-- was this before you blew his fucking brains out, or after? Ali! That was business. If it wasn't me, it just would've been somebody else. Did you kill Nicky? Yeah. Did you kill Louie? Yeah. I ripped his fucking eyeballs out, and I ate 'em! Did you kill my father? Yeah, I killed him! Big fucking deal! Everybody dies. That's just the way it is. That's a part of life. It's a part of growing up. Hey, you want to show me? Shoot! Huh? Shoot! Just don't waste my fucking time! Yeah. Yeah, I figured. You didn't have the fucking balls. No! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot! [siren] Too late. Always shoot first. Talk is just bullshit, Ali boy. You get that? Get what? Huh? Yeah. I got it. [screaming] You forgot to wear your mask this time. - Hey, Al. - Where you going? We're going to go to Coney Island for a couple of hours. You gonna be OK? Yeah, of course. I got Aunt Rose in the kitchen. You kiddin' me? Hey, come here. Give me a kiss. You gonna give your uncle a kiss, or what? All right, listen, you have fun in Coney Island, OK? Now listen, don't eat nothing, whatever you do. Because we got something special planned for dinner. Oh, really? Like what? I'm not going to tell you. Then it's not a surprise, is it? All right, be careful. Have fun. Ciao. Ciao, ciao. [music playing]
