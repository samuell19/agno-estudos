On the continent of Asia, sometime around the middle of the 21st century. Capitalism is in crisis. Western values have been swept away. The people of Asia stand at the brink of ideological and ethical collapse. A sect known as GUI-DAO: The Orbit combining politics, religion and patriotic fervor appears as a savior. It imposes a new creed: "Worship the future, despise the present“ Big brother can you hear the waves? Where's the sea? We're passing through. We got lost on our way back to the Work Farm. It's true. We're loyal to Gui Dao. We're not dissidents. Did I ask you that? We're afraid of misunderstandings. Name? Xie Xiaozhuai. And you? Xie Xiamoian. You're both under arrest. Send them to Camp Prosperity for re-education. It can't be! Take them away! On your feet! Haven't seen you in ages! Where were you? Karji. What's the news? Negotiations with the enemy. How's it going? They want kids sent to Perspective. That's their condition? Yes. Change of guard? Fine. Fall in! "Welcome to Camp Prosperity" "Where the Mind Expands to an Infinite World“ Number? 52092927 Port of origin? Port Mercenary. Inspector... Can he really leave tomorrow? Yes. Hey kid, come here! He's too little. Go away. The Inspector gave him a card! Try... Report to your inspector! Is that your kid? What's your name? Where are you from? Are you Xiaozhuai? "Mind Cleansing In Progress“ Xiaozhuai! What's that in your pocket? What are you hiding in your heart? If your heart isn't purified yet you won't be able to change your karma. Remember this: sincerity and fidelity work wonders. No wonders without sincerity and fidelity! Search! Follow me. Hey, isn't that poisonous? Keep still! Will I get my photo back? Doesn't matter. Without family one is more courageous. Life and death just comes and goes. To each his destiny. So why do you want your photo? I thought you were mute. Your kid is cute. Where are you from? From the seaside... We're here. Far from your home... Far from all that. The so-called science of the First World was wrong. It locked you in a cycle of urges. But we're in possession of the Great Wisdom. Now for the hyper-stable time of the Second World. Look inside yourself! Xuelan, do you know why you're here? Don't you know? And you? I know. Meditate! Find your path toward Gui Dao! Look Inside Yourselves Feeling more courageous now'? Why? They burned your photo. Your family has no more image. Doesn't matter. I can still dream of them. One night, I dreamt of soap. My dream smelled of its scent. The scent of "Big Forest". Yesterday, I dreamt of you. You had a scent, too. What a coincidence... What scent did I have? The scent of "Big Forest". Thank you for lying. Are your hands sweaty? How did you know'? My hands are sweaty. Xuelan, time to dance! You're leaving Orbit. Don't you want a career? You're my demon. Halt! Password! It's me! You come. Good work. Thanks, Chief! Open up. Where's the Chief? They say he left last night. Where's the Chief? We don't know. Look at your son! Are you from Mongolia? Why are you going south? The steppe is in the north. The sea is in the south. Come with us. You go ahead. I want to stay a while. Let him decide. This isn't your home! Why are you chasing us away? No prisoners here. Only refugees. So? Aren't I a refugee? Slop pushing me! Forget it, go. You have no right! If that's how it is, let's go back to the Camp. Woman, you there! Take your kid and follow me! Stop! Stop! Stop! Bastards! Xuelan! Hurry, I found a train! A train? Come here! Open kitchen... not bad. We can't live here. It's OK. We'll fix it up. He never saw an apple. Are you sure? No regrets? No regrets. And if I don't find lotus soap? Jasmine soap will be fine. What are you looking at? Is that lotus? It smells nice. "Big Forest"? That smells nice, too. Which of us smells better? Xiaozhuai, when will you take me away? Whenever, wherever you want. My pants have holes. Help me to patch them up. You want me to patch them? Of course. Want me to? Yes. OK, I'll do it I'll patch them. Like what? I'll patch them. Stop it! You've got black on your face. You've got black... There! You still have some. At present? Don't stay here. It sucks. I won't stay here. I'm leaving as soon as I get my refugee card. If you go, I'll go. Attention, residents of Block 616! Attention, residents of Block 616! Register yourselves as refugees at the Health Post of the expeditionary Task Force of the United Ports... Thanks for your help, Doctor. That's my job. What's your name? Kim Ji-Yeon. Here. Is this your first time in the ex-China zone? You could say it's the first. My grandfather often swam in the Yalu River. One day, he swam to the opposite bank which was the ex-Korea zone. Is this your wife? It's a souvenir from a war buddy. He loved his wife. One day, he wrote to her: "When I'm in danger, I feel the urge to kiss you." She answered him "Who do you kiss when you're not in danger?“ A few days later... My friend died in combat. What's wrong? Why? Leave me alone! I'm sick of this place! I want to leave! Don't tell me you want to stay! I want to live like before. How? I want to live like before. What was “before" like? Before... I didn't have this! Xuelan is waiting! Come on! Let's go! She's waiting! Tell her to come! Today, humanity finally reaches awareness! The final catastrophe has arrived. Just as I predicted! Hardened criminals will be exterminated in the furnace of Hell! "Suspension of Transmission Due to Technical Failure“ Stop it! You're wasting gas! Still alive? This car works. Are you OK? No oil. I want to go inside! Karaoke is that way. I want a drink! Go away! Want a girl? What did you say? Girl exchanged for gas. Gas? Girl for gas. You exchange girl for gas? Tomorrow... Meet here. Tomorrow night? Here. With girl? Yes. Exchange girl? Pretty girl. See you tomorrow. Good news! Just a second. Hurry up- What? I found some gas. Really? Great! Really! In exchange... you sleep with a Korean soldier. From this century, Gui Dao has been under heavy critiscisms How is Gui Dao able to achieve such success? Why there are still people believe in it, even causing the disaster? The Great Master's Formulas are so absurd Why people still see it as deity? They even sacrificing their lives. You two! Control! Leave us alone! Let us sleep! Inspection! Move it! Control! We're not from here. We're not refugees. Control! We were criminal dissidents. Now we're heroes! No controls, no cards! Forget about your cards! The radio announced catastrophe, and they're sleeping! Come on! On your feel! Historically, our ethnic beliefs have their qualities. We have never combined politics and religion. Religion has never prevailed over politics. The crisis is not a problem of today. The beginning of the last century people started seeking new belief. At that time of conﬂict, Marxism was outstanding... Its ideologies are similar to Asian cultures in many ways. But if a belief can only have effects on the public sphere... If it does not go into the daily lives, it is superficial. What belief do we really need? I can't. Some other day. Are you kidding? What will I do? What? Take it easy. Take care of your problem on your own. I have to do it all alone? I don't see the problem. Hurry. Show off your talent. Help me a little. No, do it yourself. I like to watch. You like to watch? I love it. And what do you do after? You'll see. That's enough. Gas? Not today. Tomorrow. No gas, no girl. I'll bring it tomorrow. Promise. Tomorrow, I promise. Shit! The world is falling apart and he wants a girl! Wait! Don't get angry. Listen. Don't get angry. Take these dance tickets. Don't be angry. News Flash: The plane carrying top members of the Gui Dao has crashed. All passengers are dead and gold bars are scattered on the ground. Sect headquarters are now under army control. Remaining members surrendered unconditionally. Evil reign is over! You're not lucky at all. Getting shot by the Liberators... No more running around for you. I won't run off again. I'll stay at home and watch over you and the kid. How's that? You're exaggerating. I swear... As soon as I'm better, we'll have our wedding in the street. She's not doing well. She needs to go to the hospital. Is it serious? Very serious. How long will she be hospitalized? 2 or 3 months, to wait for the results of the exams. He wants to hospitalize you. But what for? Do what he says. Exams can't hurt you. I'm afraid they'll find something wrong. Pull it off. Easy... Careful of the hair! Treasure hunt! What treasure? Haven't you heard the news? The plane crash! There's gold everywhere. Go on your own. Come on! I'm fine here. Everybody's going. If we wait around, we'll lose out. Let me tell a story. Come on!... Come on! Should I tell you a fable? "The Fox and the Crow." Come on! Look, brother! And I thought gold was in the hills... Spread out calmly! You risk being arrested for illegal assembly. Repeat! Spread out calmly! Last warning: spread out calmly. Are you hungry? I can catch a couple of fish and grill them. You know what fish eat? They eat pig shit. Pig shit or something else... It's all the same to a hungry stomach. Give me some paper. I'm going for a walk. Brother, come and see! I found something strange! What is that thing? It's really heavy. Block the window. Someone's looking in. No one's there. Cover the darkness. It's too dark outside. Big brother... I'd rather die in a ditch. Or on a road... instead of in a school. We'll leave tomorrow. I want to go home, too. Let's go home. But it's not possible... We'll never go home. What's the use? Why did you leave the hospital? I just didn't want to stay. What about your doctor'? He's going back to Port Perspective in a couple of days. He wants to take me and the kid. That's good. Isn't Port Perspective supposed to be paradise on earth? The long-awaited special detachment finally arrived at Prosperity at 8am. Spring is coming. Everything awakens after the harsh winter. We can finally return to our normal way of life like before. Let's now celebrate the victory of Spring! He wants to marry me and take me to Port Perspective. Don't you have anything to say to me? What's the use? Never... We can never go back in time. What do you really think? Damned matches! Passengers travelling to Port Perspective... are kindly asked to proceed to Gate 238. Flight YU 309 is ready for boarding. Passengers are kindly asked to proceed to Gate 238.
