In the beginning there was man. From man came woman, given to us by God, to be a mother, a lover, and a friend. From woman came sin, which brings us to today. In the beginning the world had light, and the streets weren't so scary, and pimps never chose to be married, but married needed a pimp so the game chose me. And the pimp in me chose to pimp the game, like no other pimp before me, because before me was a life that was trife and a knife that had life, and I wasn't trying to get stabbed, shanked or robbed, I was trying to eat sweet and live life, till I was the biggest hog on the job. But now I'm floating towards that sewer. I hear the sewer calling. In the beginning there was trouble, and spades risked it all. There was a war and if you slip, you will fall, so I found a place to walk where you didn't have to crawl, and the game that I played really wasn't a game at all, it was about business and business was good, long as these bitches stayed in pocket, and these niggas understood, don't fuck with my money, 'cause my money's my life. So I married that bitch and I'd kill for my wife. In the beginning, pimps wore fluorescent clothes, and hoes froze when we pose with our hands above the air. More afraid of a slap than the stare than the clap that was there, that was hiding in the nastiness of despair. In the beginning, there was women and cars, and jewels, high-heel shoes, furs and tools, and beautiful, beautiful homes. In the beginning, there was money and everything was cool. In the beginning. Bitch who the fuck told you, to have a mother fuckin, baby? Bitch. Stop! Bitch, you think you... Stupid ass bitch. Who told you to have a, mother fuckin baby? Huh? You 'round here playin'. Motha fucka. Bitch, I asked you a question. Who told you to have a mother fuckin baby? I just, I didn't know I was pregnant! Fuckin play with me bitch. I didn't know!

What's that? You can at least knock before you barge in. Happy? Now why is that baby laying on your bed? I found it. You found a baby? Yeah! Where? In the street. It's storming outside. I know. Why'd you bring it here? Because it was in the street. So did you call police or social services? No. Why not? There's probably a mother or father, shit, or both, frantic looking for that baby right now. No, they're not. How you know that? Because I watched her. She was wearing a hospital gown, so I figured she was fresh out of having a baby. She probably was a hooker. That's what I was thinking. You know them pimps, they don't like having no little babies around. All I know is, she got out the car, dropped the baby in the gutter, got back in the car and left. They left him there to die, Kenya. In the middle of a rain storm, I had to take him! Now what? Now I have a baby. Jewel, you barely have a mattress, and the only reason why you had that is because I took you in when nobody else was fuckin with you. How you gonna take care of a baby. I don't know, but it's here now, so I'mma have to figure it out. It's okay. I've had four miscarriages, in two years Kenya. God didn't give me the body to have a baby. What you gone call him? Gutter. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. We can use my WIC card to get food and Similac. My brother Louisville work at a supermarket, I'm sure he can steal us some pampers!

And it doesn't let go. Now, you've all been very successful. All the hard work sacrifices, finally payin off. And what I'm sayin to you Gutter, is you're making a lot of money right now. You're actually making $250,000 a month, which is the same as Lady J, who has less inventory. Half a million dollars is some good money. You could be making five, ten times that with me. What we propose to you is a 60 40 split 60 for us and 40 for you. Man, hold the fuck up, what does that leave lady J? Oh I'm sure we'll find something for her, a place far to go. Like a river or a nice pine box. Try it, and you gone get put up in one afterwards. All right. We're on the same team. Are we? Look Mr. Rossy, with all due respect, I won't be working with you.

You see I'm black, you are white Italian and then your eyes, I ain't none but a muley nigga slash animal. You expect me to go against Lady J? Because that's what we supposed to do? You think we have low calls? No laws? No loyalty? No honor? But see what you fail to realize is I'm not a muley or a nigga. I'm a black man, and I got no problem with killing you or anybody else in this bitch, before I ever go against one of mine, including Lady J. All right, everybody calm down. Look, I don't know anything about this, Black Lives Matter this one the fatter, I could give a shit. There's only one color that matters to me, and that's green. And which faces of the presidents were on those bills? And how many of them are in my wallet and in my bank account? And that's all that should matter to you too. Now look, I made a very generous offer, think about it, it's non-negotiable. Chew it up, try it on, see how it fits. Take a couple of days. And if you're smart, you'd put those Ben Franklin's in your bank account, millions and millions of em. Hurry up. No, no, Jewel. Please let me leave okay? Please, I won't get high. I don't care.

But the streets out here jealous Gutter, that's why they shooting at us, not because we're threat huh? They want our money, guns, drugs, women. If we wanna survive in this fuckin game, you know what we gotta do. In the beginning. I was angry. I thought that home wasn't home and my birth was a mistake that left me angry and alone. I had so much hate inside me, hate for women, hate for life, so I cheat women to be life. But it wasn't my life I was cheating, It was my self-respect for God's most incredible creation Couldn't be accomplished by an accomplished rapist, murdering/ angry, brat motha fucka. It was the anger moving me to live the way that I live and to do the things that I did. At least that's how I justified my psychotic pathologic idiotic, new way of living. In the end, the streets sell hookers, and hustles house just like dirty rain water building up on the sidewalk flowing towards the sewer destruction. In the end, I was a child who grew up to be a drug dealer without ever truly becoming a man. There was no blood, no violence, no death in the end. Unfortunately this isn't. So you got the world in your hands now nephew, what you going to do with it? Shit, Give it to you Unc. You ever thought about bein a pimp?
