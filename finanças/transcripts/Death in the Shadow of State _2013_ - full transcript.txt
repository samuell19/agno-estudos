Breaking news, apologies for the interruption, but we have just learned of the death of Health Minister Frédéric Dalème. Live from the Élysée, correspondent Mathieu Chinchard. Mathieu, do you have the details? Yes, David. The news has just been confirmed in a statement made by a government spokesperson. This evening, at 10 pm, the Health Minister, Frédéric Dalème, took his own life in one of the Élysée chambers, where he was waiting to meet with President Jacques Rohmerieu. STATE SECRETS Is everything alright, sir? Where is the President? We can't leave him here. The President's quarters, with the Health Minister inside? Impossible. - Where should we put him then? - I don't know! In the Green Room? He had an informal meeting, he was waiting alone... You can't be serious! The President didn't see him. He only heard the gunshot. 10 pm. LOGISTICS BASE, 12TH SUPPORT UNIT MAREUIL Lieutenant, we checked, he's not been bagged. Shit... Odhiambo? Jackson Odhiambo? Odhiambo! Jackson Odhiambo! - Don't piss me off, Santamaria. - Guisnel said you did nothing. Guisnel is a pain in the arse. I made up stuff to stop him from busting my balls. And the Interior Minister? He's doing a tour of Algeria. I had to call the police myself. Well, the Director General. They're sending someone. I don't understand. In the Green Room? I heard nothing. - You were the only one. - Anne said he was with you. We were waiting for Jacques. It was a routine meeting, to prepare for Dublin. I needed a file, I left the room... His wife, Marianne, has she been told? Did he leave anything here? A letter? A note? - Anything that could... - What? Explain it? - Do you need an explanation? - He had a gun, Marianne. A pistol. Did you know he had one? So, he had a gun and nobody knew about it? He came to the Élysée with a gun! A gun, for Christ's sake! - You think he wanted to kill you? - He had no reason to kill me. Are you scared, Jacques? A man like you? You know all about fear already. Sir... It's the Africans. The Defence Department just called. One of them has escaped. We'll find him, it's just a matter of time. He can't have gotten far. The Prime Minister called again. He wants to annoy me with his scruples, like I'm the one to make it all better. I'm surrounded by idiots! What did I pick you all for? What good are you? All my counsellors and ministers! Why the hell did he do this to me, now of all times? All the press outlets are already covering it. It seems it's already all over the radio. - Santamaria will give a statement. - People hate the unknown. They'll want to know why he killed himself, and whether we pushed him to. The opposition will have a field day. - Romanet? - We need to hit back. That would be like beating up a five-year-old. What do you take me for? It isn't Romanet that scares me. We need to change tactics. It's fine, everyone's asleep. I want a new angle. Surprise me. We called Audibert, I'm meeting him now. What? Don't you want Audibert? He's stuck-up and priggish. But he knows everyone, he gets things done... He's the best man for this. I want Claire Ferran. Don't waste your time, I know what you're going to say. That was during the elections. It was three years ago, things have changed. You were asking for her head. If it were up to me... Do you think she's changed, in three years? You know as well as I do, that woman is uncontrollable. She works for the opposition now! All the more reason then. Romanet doesn't deserve her. Frédéric Dalème was a personal friend of the President. Could you tell us how the President reacted? No, David, not yet. All I can tell you is that the President is still at the Élysée. I've been told he is having talks with the Prime Minister via telephone. Hello? Okay... To be frank, I'm a bit surprised by this proposition. Do you still blame me, after all this time? I had my reasons, Claire. Let's just say that now, I'm ready. Perhaps you are too. Where did he die? The Green Room. He was your most popular minister. A meteoric rise, a flawless record, suicide will be hard to explain. Perhaps he was overworked, I don't know. Too much success, too quickly. Do you feel responsible for his death, sir? After all, you were the one to get him into politics. That sounded like a reproach. He was my friend, Claire. A close friend, a man of valour. I thought that France deserved him. - Do you think that's ridiculous? - No. Didn't it bother you that he was more popular? The student became the master, it's a compliment. I'll need to have total free reign to work. No restrictions. No principled objections. And most importantly, I answer only to you. Yes, tomorrow morning, here in his office. Just the President and two of your people. No, no politics. I want an intimate setting. Emotional and heart-warming. They were really close. Not, not Emilie, they have no chemistry together. Agatha is fine, he'll be more at ease. We'll make the afternoon news, with evening recaps. Do we have a deal? Perfect. Good, see you tomorrow. Do you think that's wise? Going in front of the press, right away? What would you prefer? Locking him away? Making people think he has something to hide? You're exposing him. You're putting him in the line of fire. He was his friend, Shaï, everybody knew that. If he's quiet and keeps his distance, that's bad. Didn't you see it coming? - Was he behaving differently? - He didn't tell you anything? Like what? He was going to kill himself? You were his assistant, he could have... Did he give you any documents? Florence, you know how much commotion this will cause. She's coming with me. Follow me... Just to the ministry. To his office, to clear up a few things. Frédéric Dalème had been Health Minister for a few years. He was a politician... Well, my source says he left the Élysée at 11 pm. Right... He went to see Marianne Dalème. Exactly. The two men were friends. Intimate friends, you could say. In any event, for a man who was not a career politician... Well, what was he doing taking a gun to the Élysée? Some people learn quickly. Frédéric Dalème exhibited an unassuming mix... How do you know that then? Cut the crap, they won't just take her out! Is that how he became France's favourite politician? He crossed the whole department, then he went through the woods. And that's where you lost him. It was a populated area, sir. I wasn't going to send in armed men with dogs. So the President should thank you? Is that it? - Yes? - General. Surveillance footage from Mareuil-sur-Ourcq station. - Is it him? - 11.57 pm. Platform two, heading to Paris. I warned the guards at Paris East, but we've heard nothing. Maybe he didn't reach Paris. How many stops are there between Mareuil and Paris? We'll check. I'm counting on you, General. Deal with this. You'll hand in a report to the Interior Ministry. You'll co-ordinate with the military. We need to find him before he talks to anyone. He speaks no French, so that's something. I've informed special crimes units, the police and the gendarmes. I cooked up a reason for the search. He's an important witness in an immigrations case. Does that work for you? Target humanitarian aid networks, the Red Cross. If he tries to get help, it'll be from them. It went really well. He was great, as usual. I reckon he'll come top of the afternoon viewing figures. Patrick will singing my praises! Dalème? I met him once, last year, at friend's party. Handsome, very clever, very charming... Once you have people, it's easy. Spend five minutes with them, you want to be their mate. Sorry, I have to go. Come to one of Thibaut's dinners, Stéphane will be delighted. You too, see you soon. Ciao. Romanet called. Your mobile was going to voicemail. There's a mole at the Élysée. I think he understood. A courier delivered them just now. No message, no name. Don't worry, I know who they're from. Like my flowers? They brought back memories. Good ones, I hope. We had some great times together... I saw Rohmerieu, at 1 pm. He's a touching guy. It's like he's almost human... Someone else is calling the shots... The President calls the shots. Give it a rest. Are you spewing the party line? Don't bother. - Why do you think he chose you? - "He" didn't choose me. It was Rohmerieu who chose me. Anyway, it's not hard to work out. With Audibert, that was three years ago. - Seen their ratings? - Audibert is one of the gang. - They won't just drop him. - And? I suppose you have a theory, as usual? Do you really think it was suicide? So, that's it. I could feel it coming. Claire, he went to the Élysée with a gun. So? He walked through the gardens too. You know he visited at night, they don't do the same checks. And he was Rohmerieu's friend. But you still think they killed him! I know you don't work for a real newspaper now... Let me stop you right there. I work for a real newspaper. Just because it's online... Killing a man at the Élysée? Next to the President's office? - He must have been mad! - Won't everyone say that? No? What is it? Alright. Have they won you over? Don't you see what's going on? Bloody hell, Claire. Open your fucking eyes! Can't you see this story stinks? They chose you so they can ditch you in the end! Right, we're done. When will your friends in the press start asking real questions? Let go of me, Nicolas. Know how many bodies they hide under the floorboards? Do you know Rohmerieu can do? Nicolas, let me go! Look at yourself! Will you listen to yourself? You're pathetic, like your shitty flowers. This is Africa's worst crisis of the last 15 years. France can't just sit by and do nothing. We've heard talk from some about suspicious activism, but look at these images. France was the first... I am also here today as a witness to a horror that we have all too often allowed to perpetuate, in the name of an imagined ideal and adherence to established order. What is happening in Niyamalinga today has nothing to do with fatality but everything to do with cowardice. Anybody who has seen what I have seen... Hello, Patrice? How are you? Word gets around quickly. What, now? Thank you, Alexandre. Was this really necessary? You and I in this office? With the media circus outside? I'm the President of the Republic, Marianne. There are things I'm expected to do. Right. Like what? Consoling the widow of France's favourite politician? My image? I have other problems right now. So, you want a state funeral. You want to put on a big show. Was that your own idea, or Claire Ferran's? I think he has the right to one. Don't you think so? The worst thing is, he might have agreed to it, today. At one time, he would have laughed. He had changed. - People change. - It was you who sought him out. You offered him a ministry. You knew what you were doing, Jacques. You French, whenever there's power, it has to shine! Your polished floors, your gilded ceilings... This palace! It's like being inside a box of chocolates! It's sickening. Well... I suppose a 30-minute consolation is long enough? Are you crying? Stop! What's gotten into you? For the photo on the porch, let's keep things civil. I've just lost my husband. I'd like to avoid being made out to be a whore. You're joking! You're not going to publish this? Cécile hasn't made her decision. We've been sitting on this for three weeks, now's the time. I think it'd be a mistake, we just report the news. We're not gutter press. Does Cécile share your opinion? Well, famous people today... Dalème just offed himself, at the Élysée to boot. - These are special circumstances. - But it's not news, Patrice! It's nothing! - Who gave it to you? - Gave me what? A text from Rohmerieu to Marianne Dalème? "See you tonight, I need you in my arms, I love you." A month later, the cuckold puts a bullet in his head. Cuckold? Are you mad? Rohmerieu and Marianne have known each other for ages! Rohmerieu set her up with Dalème! - He went to their wedding! - So what? - Is that not significant? - They're close, like siblings. Tell me you didn't pay money for that, Patrice. It was sent while Dalème was away and the lovers were in Paris. You know what? Do what you like. Publish that, you'll look ridiculous. It's definitely a fake. Phony texts are commonplace now. It's true, I don't know why you'd believe it. Are we sure it's a fake? Can you make me a guarantee? You're saying the President had an affair with Marianne Dalème? Ask him. Are you taking the piss? I don't think you're seeing the big picture. We're in a forest. There's dry wood everywhere. Just one careless spark and we're up in flames! Save the lousy metaphors for your media cronies. For Christ's sake... Alright, let's say he did, what do we do? I want to see the President. Were you followed? Cut it out! You're scaring me shitless! This is the last time. We had a deal. Well, the deal's off. After I tell you this, what about my debt? We'll see, now, I'm listening. In any event, he was a minister with a vision, and you can't deny that. He had a political vision. Don't twist my words, I never said you could deny... - Still talking about him? - It's all they're talking about. It reminds me of Princess Diana's death. The same media circus. See the flowers outside the Élysée? Yes, it seems they want to set up an express lane. They reckon it'll interfere with the traffic. Can you pour me some wine? I'm knackered. Faced with what many call history's greatest ever humanitarian catastrophe, the Niyamalinga civil war... So, the week-long holiday in Saint Barts, I suppose that's off? Could we put it off? Well, after that, I've got to go to Delhi, Singapore and Düsseldorf. We could go separately. Thank you. I saw Sadoun. He had a breakfast meeting with Santamaria. - Rohmerieu said some nice things. - About me? Wait till he sees my invoice! Yes, Nicolas? Just drop it, we've already talked about this. What, now? I'm dead on my feet. I'm not going out now. Here's one. They always come here. Hello there. It's alright, mate. Sir, it's alright. It's alright, listen. Don't be scared, we're here to help you. Are you hungry? Do you speak French? Food? Drink? We have blankets too, back there. Come on. Don't be scared. Where are you from? Country? What country? It's no good. All the shelters are full, nobody will take him. What should we do then? He can't talk French, he's got no papers. We can't leave him out here. I know what you're thinking. Don't start with your bullshit again! You know that's against the law! We can get you some pâté too if you like. No, that's very kind, I don't want to put you out. - Isn't the maid here? - She left. She's not a maid, she looks after Adèle. The kid? How old is she now? Three? - Five. - Five already! You must not see her much. We bump into her now and again, between horse auctions and orgies with Saudi princes... All's well then... Stéphane, leave, please. Leave us for a while. So? Too much salt. Will you lighten up for a minute? They lied to you. Dalème didn't die in the Green Room. He shot himself in Rohmerieu's room, and Rohmerieu was with him when it happened. - Was your informer there? - Listen... Did he see the body? Even if Dalème did kill himself in front of Rohmerieu, don't you think it was smart to move the body? The private quarters are too intimate. - It'd get people thinking. - This is mind-blowing. Do you ever listen to yourself? This isn't news, it's a bomb! This is real! Sweetheart. - Your bath is ready. - What? Didn't you ask me to run you a bath? Don't bother, it's not worth it... I've nothing left to do here. Forget what I said, just forget it. Week after week, the Buyende camp more closely resembles a town... They arrive in hundreds each day, sometimes in thousands, like yesterday. Tomorrow, the UN General Assembly must adopt a second aid plan for the Niyamalinga refugees. Many here truly hope they will rise to the occasion. You're from there? How did you get here? I don't understand. Do you realise what you're asking of me? Do you realise what will happen when that text gets out? It will get out, you're right. Nobody can do anything about it, so what's the point? The context, Marianne. They're all looking for answers. They want to understand why he killed himself. Do you want us two to be that answer? Do you want a life where people look at you that way? I want a life based on the truth. That's a heavier burden than whatever they may think. Tell Ferran I'll play no part in her sordid little games. You're drinking too much. At any rate, now he's dead, can't we tell everyone now? The real love story was between you two. Frédéric Dalème and Jacques Rohmerieu! Who's leading who? Who's fucking who? And what was I? Something to spice things up? You will do as I ask, Marianne. You'll think about it, you'll calm down, you'll talk to Claire Ferran. You will do as she says. Francis will take you home. If these were my test results... Have you seen these markers? These transaminases? I'm not a specialist, Michèle. Neither am I, I'm just a medical journalist, but your friend should see one, quickly. If this is the cancer I think it is... Hasn't he already seen a doctor? He should know about this. I wasn't supposed to have seen this. Who is your friend? Let's say, it's somebody who, with similar results, might do something stupid. Something stupid? Like what? Put a bullet in his head? I've already told Jacques, so now I'll tell you. No way am I taking part in this vile masquerade. I understand this is hard, but it's important. You understand, do you? I've had to put up with this state funeral, now this cancer story, your bright idea. I can't go out anywhere! Reporters are everywhere, they think I'll talk about my husband's cancer! Would you rather they asked why you were cheating on him? Madam... It's time, we should get going. Les Invalides. The funeral of a great man. I assure you, there's nothing between the President and I. Do you know the real reason he killed himself? Everyone who knows is lying. Is the truth so terrible? Do you know what I realised about Jacques? I've known him for 30 years, and I've never seen him lose. Not at anything, not even a game of cards. Jacques Rohmerieu doesn't stand losing. That's the truth, Mrs Ferran. He doesn't stand losing. And, he's capable of anything. Frédéric Dalème's state funeral is taking place this afternoon at Les Invalides, in a highly reverent atmosphere. During the eulogy, which he gave himself in front of his friend's coffin, President Jacques Rohmerieu was, at times, visibly overcome with emotion. VAL-DE-GRÂCE HOSPITAL, PARIS - So? - There's nothing wrong with her. The scooter she hit, however... - And the scooter driver? - There were two of them, in fact. The driver and a photographer. A photographer? That's all we need. A mangled up hand, split eyebrow, it could have been worse. - It could have been a disaster. - Didn't Marianne have a bodyguard? She managed to give him the slip. Don't ask me how. Want to know her blood-alcohol level? She had taken meds as well! - Has Rohmerieu been told? - He's up there with her. Where is the photographer? Here, in A&E, they're x-raying his hand. Keep him here, I want a word with him. - Sir, this is unreasonable. - I was discreet. That's what they all say. May I see her? He threatened me. Not directly. He was fretting over me. He wants to protect me. You almost killed a journalist. A course of detox, in some clinic for rich guys. Some Dr "Whatever-Their-Name-Is." That's what they want. They want to lock me away. Does he scare you? Don't you see he's the one scared of you? We fear what we can't control. Reassure him. - Show him you're on his side. - How? - You want to put her in a clinic? - You've seen what she can do. That's not a good idea, sir. Swearing her to silence won't work. Unless you're willing to go further. Let me deal with this. - I'll turn her into an asset. - Marianne? An asset? I'll talk to the photographer. - That guy? Shaï can do that. - No way! We do this my way, got it? Trust me. So, you definitely plan to return there? My parents and my sister live in Boston, I miss them. Frédéric was my only family in France. I think we've covered everything. One last thing though. - Your husband's illness... - We had an agreement! Claire, I can't not ask that question. It's alright. I don't mind. - I know this is delicate... - He didn't say, the news told me. Do you think he was trying to protect you? Perhaps. I don't know. He didn't dare talk to me, he kept it to himself. And then... Thank you. Got everything? Could I get a few more by the window? - If you don't mind. - No problem. - Don't do that to me again! - I know, I'm sorry. You were right, he didn't press charges. He even apologised. The world's been turned upside down. Jean-Michel will send me the transcript before it goes out. If you want to change anything, let me know. You have zero scruples, it's fascinating. Giving reporters false information isn't a problem for you. Information, yes, but what information? Nothing but "ifs" and "maybes". Any reporter worth their salt won't cover the cancer story. However, just switch on the TV or open a newspaper... I'd be curious to know what you would do with the truth if you ever came across it, out of nowhere. No "ifs" or "maybes". I'm not scared of the truth, Because you don't know what it is. They know what you do, who you meet and who you speak to. You're not being cautious enough. You're wrong. As rumours surrounding the suicide of Frédéric Dalème run rife, information published this evening could shed new light on this question. Following medical revelations, the minister could have known, days beforehand, that he was suffering from an incurable cancer. Obviously, this information is still being verified, but if it is confirmed, it would perhaps clear up the mystery surrounding a man who, since he entered politics, gave people a reason to smile... - Ferran is asking questions. - Are you getting nervous? She went to see the Élysée guards this morning. She wanted details on the suicide. The circumstances, the time, the exact location of the body... You're a bag of nerves, Shaï. You always need to imagine the worst. It makes you what you are. You know she talks to a journalist? Yes, Santamaria told me. Walewski? Palewksi? Malisewski, he works for an online paper. He's into conspiracy theories. He's quite well informed too, I'm sad to say. Could she find out about the body? I told you, she's asking questions. Let her ask then, if she wants to snoop, let her. You're having her watched, aren't you? If she finds something, it means we have a leak. And if she finds the leak? When she finds the leak, she reveals what she knows. Do you really think I have the power to invent news? I'm like you, Nicolas, the news was a surprise to me too. Go on, carry on taking me for an idiot. In any event, we're still not sure. We're trying to get Marianne Dalème to verify this. You've changed, Claire. He's the one who changed you. - He? - You weren't like this with me. - I must be dreaming! - What? You're still bitter I left you for him? Eight years after the fact? I'm not making this up. You didn't marry Stéphane Ferran, you married his bank account! And the nicest address in Paris! - If I'm that bad, why look for me? - I didn't say that. You give me something, I give you something, is that it? You're not so clean either. There's always a catch with you. He was going to run for office. Do you understand what that means? What? Dalème? The Presidency. Against Rohmerieu? He already had campaign staff, it was official. I have names. The President has made his choice. Marie-France Vauthier will be the new Health Minister. They'll announce it tonight, I wanted you to know beforehand. She's looking for an assistant, are you interested? Where's your head at? Florence? Don't make that face, nobody is forcing you. You know, I've thought about it, sir. - I... - That's not good enough. We're all in the same boat now. The President is counting on you. You know, what I did, I did because Mr Dalème asked me. Not in this office. Turn the page. This is a fresh start. We forget all this. So, this job. Are you interested? I'm calling the ministry. He can stay with me a while. - What language does he speak? - Fon. With a bit of English. It's a bit weird, it'll be hard finding an interpreter. Can he stay here for a bit? Just while I find someone to help him. If he came from Benin, I have friends in Villetaneuse. - They could look after him. - Good stuff. - Is he in trouble? - He's got no papers. In France today, that's a big problem. No papers? Is that all? - Yes. - He can stay with me. - But, listen... - It won't be for long. - Alright? - Alright, mate. - Thanks a lot, Djibril. - Good luck. Ciao! There are so many foxes in Vincennes Forest. - You're joking! - I swear it's true! Anyway, back to the topic at hand, Romanet still hasn't recovered! - He wants you dead! - Well, he's a lost cause. Since the regional elections, he's lost everything. Did you read his Sunday interview? Enlightening, wasn't it? You were right to drop him. He was dragging you down. Don't be so hasty to bury him, Noëlle. I hope you've been careful, Claire, Romanet has a long memory. Revenge is a dish best served cold! Anyway, the dinner was lovely, thank you. Wow! The famous chocolate mousse! Famous? I don't think I've beaten the egg whites enough. Jacques! What are you doing here? This charming young lady opened the door for me. - Don't be shy, I won't bite. - That's not what Fieschi says! That head case? This is Jennifer, she's looking after Adèle. Stéphane hired her, I bet! I'm sure of it! Tell us if we're annoying you. You Presidents are all the same! They have no manners at all. I've had enough of manners for tonight. It was an OECD dinner. If only you knew how bloody boring they are! Are you sure I'm not intruding? No, of course not. Not at all. Here. Tell me what you think. I'm sure your personal chef can't make anything as delicious! Thank you. There you go, Mr President. - I'll have a small wine too! - Of course. This is great, thank you. - Mousse? - Yes, please. Are you alright, Claire? I'm fine, thanks. Are you sure? Did you not mind? Since I became President, it feels like I put people out. It's no longer possible to enter a room like a normal guy. How is Stéphane? He's alright. He spends half of his time between Bombay and Washington. You can tell, he looks exhausted. I know a Chinese guy in Aubervilliers, it's amazing what he does with needles and hot stones. It'd be worth visiting him. Did you come here to talk about Chinese medicine? I wasn't honest with you, Claire. I didn't tell you everything. Things are more complicated than you think. He killed himself in front of me. It was in my private quarters. He didn't come to see me, the President. He came to see me as a friend. The text message. The one you sent to Marianne Dalème? That one, and the rest, he found out and that was it. The gun he was carrying, was it meant for you? He was... He had a mad look in his eye I had never seen before. When he pulled out the revolver, for a moment, I truly thought he was going to... But no, it was for him. I never thought it would come to this. Shaï had the body moved. We couldn't just leave him there. You could imagine the rumours. Thank you. You didn't have to tell me. I did. I owe you that much. It's important you know, even Santamaria doesn't know. Good evening. I was blind. I didn't want to see how much he loved her. Hello? Nicolas? I thought about what you said, about Dalème and the elections. You said he put a team together, can you tell me more? - Where did you find this out? - Please, Martin. People talk to people who talk to other people. You work for the second largest communications group in France. I don't need to tell you how this all works. In any event, he's dead, right? This big secret between you two doesn't matter much now. I didn't understand why he did what he did, up until now. He could have done it, the people wanted him. When did he want to announce this? We didn't get to that point. He had work to do before seeing if it was worth it. We were coming up with a good strategy. Did Rohmerieu know? - He must have known! - I have no idea if he did! He wasn't just going to tell us! If Dalème was a candidate, Rohmerieu's second term looked unlikely. Yes, if we suppose he wanted to run for a second term. I don't understand. Why all these questions? I'm trying to protect the President. You can imagine how much damage this story could cause. I'd just like to know who your leads are, that's all. I want to know who knows, who is dangerous and who isn't. - Régis Lepetit? - Yes? Police. - Who ratted me out? My colleague? - Fuck's sake! Someone saw you bring that African into your home! They didn't see me bring him into my home! He wanted him to, but he didn't, so he left. Are you taking the piss? And what about you? With this "immigration network"? That isn't what he told me. He told me about the army. And that camp in Africa, Buyende. It's been all over the TV for weeks now. What do you want with this kid? Didn't you know he's just a kid? I'll pick a name, at random. The day before last. Djibril N'dongo, three calls... Why do you want this kid so badly? He told me he was sick. What did he mean by "sick"? What sickness? You've thought long and hard about this, right? Your generation always comes up with a conspiracy theory. Well, I don't give a damn what you believe, Mr Lepetit. We're talking organised crime here. We'll be keeping you here for 96 hours, then, after, you'll be held until trial. Three or six months, time enough to prove your innocence. Is it really worth it? - Stay right there! - Let me go! And Luna Park Two and Three? Have they got him? No signal on my end, General. Apparently, he hasn't flown the coop. If he is inside, I'd rather we dealt with him ourselves. Shit, it's all kicking off. I can't believe this... They can't even fucking deal with these scum! Put me through to the Ministry! It's General Gillardi, Minister. What you said yesterday, about Stéphane and me, I'd like to remind you, I had my own business when I met him, with big clients, Delterme, in Bercy, Aérospatiale, Mauvignier, chez Lafarge... - Don't get carried away... - Nobody believed I did it alone! Okay, I take it back, alright? - Can we get back to the subject? - Sure. I just don't like your shitty insinuations. I started looking into Dalème's schedule. I started from his suicide and worked backwards. Where did I write it... Cipriani, does that ring any bells? Michel Cipriani. Dalème went to his funeral the morning he killed himself. - Cipriani? - Right. He was a doctor, apparently. He has a sister, I'll try talking to her. He had fallen asleep on his sofa. There were papers all over his apartment, along with a mouldy old carpet. It quickly went up in flames. Was your brother overworked? Normally, when you nod off with a fag in your mouth... Why are you so interested in Michel's death? Dalème went to his funeral, then put a bullet in his head. Well, there it is, on the fifth floor. Michel Cipriani, graduated from Paris Medical School, the same year as Dalème, they did their residency together. How many years did he work in humanitarian aid? Ever since he left medical school. Him and Dalème, always together. Bolivia, Cambodia, Burkina Faso... The Niyamalinga crisis... Cipriani spent three months in Buyende. - Do you think they met up there? - What do you think? Dalème must have gone there at least a dozen times. Anyway, they met up in France at Cipriani's place. I checked out his neighbourhood. - His building had a concierge... - Did she see Dalème? In Cipriani's flat, the evening of the 25th. The Health Minister, Claire, in a crappy northern suburb. Let's say she did see him, so what? So what? The next morning, Cipriani went up in flames. You think this was a criminal fire? I called a friend at Bobigny Court, he's a clerk there. He'll try to get me the investigation folder. I'll look at the expert's report, and the causes of the fire. There must be an explanation. I mean, another explanation! Cipriani's letter box was forced open, why do you think that was? Florence Portier? My name is Claire Ferran. I suppose you know who I am. Can I sit with you for a moment? - Did Santamaria send you? - No. Santamaria doesn't know I want to talk to you. I'm sorry, I can't. I met with Martin Deniker. I don't know who he is. Listen, we seriously need to talk. We can meet somewhere else, if you want. I'm sorry. I want to know why he died. You can help me understand. Please. At least take this. Here. Do you want me to drop you home? Not right now. What happened? Were you followed? No, I don't think so. Your paranoia must be rubbing off on me. Well, I checked. If Dalème visited Cipriani on the night of the 25th, he went there alone without telling anybody. He didn't even take his chauffeur. And you? - Your clerk friend? - About the fire? He showed me the file, the expert's report was gone. - How come? - He says it happens quite often. Bits go missing. That lousy court won't even pay for a new photocopier... So the judge just closed the case? Of course he did. "Accidental fire". Dalème met Cipriani in secret, without telling anyone, not even his chauffeur? Why? They met up, they talked, then the next day, Cipriani died "accidently", then ten days later, Dalème dies. They must have talked about something that night. Then they were both killed? Dalème, assassinated at the Élysée? You come up with nothing but half-assed ideas! Fine, imagine they got rid of him somewhere else! A suicide in his home? Or his office? There would have been ten times as many rumours! Remember Boulin? Remember Bérégovoy? It's the same thing! And what about the investigation? The Élysée? It's a no-go zone! Who'd go bother them? - Stop. - Nobody would! - Stop! - Who'd ask tough questions? - Nobody would! - Stop! For God's sake! Why did I ever listen to you? Why did I even let you back into my life? Do you know the mess you're getting me into? This talk about moving the body? I should have rushed straight to Santamaria's office! But you didn't... My boss is the President, Nicolas! The President of the Republic! I don't think you know what this means to me, what this represents! Anyway, it's a good thing you've been snooping, getting me into this great big mess. Are you happy now? Did you get your revenge? But, I... Listen, getting carried away won't get us anywhere, will it? We'll get our heads straight and take a step back... Right, let's do that, take a step back. How long have you been following me for? - Sorry? - Don't lie! I saw you behind me at the station, who are you? Today, the new Health Minister, Marie-France Vauthier... Alright? Yes, I'm fine. You don't look it. I saw Santamaria this morning. He seemed a bit... I don't know, preoccupied. He knows you're seeing Malisewski. And not just here. What are you doing with that loser? Would you like a clementine? And what about your secret meeting in the kitchen? - What's this about? - I don't want to talk about it. Well, I do! That guy is dangerous! Can't you see what he's doing? He's just a jealous ex-boyfriend! Jealous of what? Of this? He's jealous of you, the woman you've become. Thanks to you? What's that supposed to mean? Swear to me you've never once thought it! I'm getting some fresh air. I need to clear my head. Mr Bates works for the same NGO as Cipriani did. We're based in Glasgow. He's also looking into his death. Why? Is there something suspicious about it? Cipriani worked in the Buyende camp. Two weeks ago, he returned to France and contacted me. He said he had something important to tell me. We were meant to meet in London, he didn't show. Couldn't he talk over the telephone? He was afraid he was being bugged. After Cipriani's death, Mr Bates went to Buyende. He found some interesting things. Whispers and rumours, nothing concrete. Refugees were going missing in the French sector of the camp. The military was taking people away. The French military? Why? And where to? I don't know. I don't even know if that was what Cipriani wanted to discuss. Your minister, Dalème... Do you know why he went to see Cipriani? I told Mr Bates about Dalème. I told him about the meeting on the 25th. Do you think there's a link? Why did you tell him about the 25th? - Did you tell him anything else? - Not here... What are you doing? - Hello. - Hey, Nicolas. Moving the body? Do you think I'm a bloody idiot? What do you know about this guy? Is he who he says he is? Listen. Now we know why Cipriani wanted to see Dalème. Rumours, Nicolas... We need to be more careful now. Take this. - In three days, throw it away. - And you? Don't worry about me, I'm used to it. You were right, I shouldn't have got you involved. I'm just a massive arsehole, I'm sorry. That's nice. In fact, you're a real nice guy. - That's your problem. - Right. A nice guy... This has been going on for centuries. Africa possesses vast riches which the world has robbed. But France won't be the last to stir up trouble in the region? That's why I say certain practices must be stopped. All politicians have said the same thing for some time now, so why has nothing changed? A lack of courage, Mr Pujadas. I suppose you know the stakes? Who would dare stand up to such large interest groups? Will somebody ever have the courage to bring to light all these back-door dealings? You? That's possible. Somebody's asking for you, it's the Élysée. Claire! Glad you could make it! Marie-France Vauthier, Claire Ferran. This isn't an introduction, I just thought you could use some fresh air. We're off to Cannes, Germaine Tillon Hospital. A new oncology ward. It'll be most exciting. We leave in five minutes, Mr President. Do you think she was the right choice? She's a respectable woman, people listen to her. She's guarantee your centrist vote in the election. You still hate her. She also asked for your head three years ago. Did you think it was unfair of me? To fire you like that, no explanations? - Do you know why I fired you? - I'm not interested, sir. Look at you. It still hurts you, after all this time. But the second I call you, you come running, just like that. There are some offers you don't turn down. The pain, Claire. The pain is still there, that's why you came back so fast. You think I'm out for revenge? I fired you to knock you down a peg. You looked so grand on your high horse. You have much to learn, Claire. I'm learning a lot from you, sir. Especially recently. Are you referring to him? What do you know about him? I know you found out about Frédéric's candidacy. What did you think? Would you have let him go ahead? Do you think I got rid of him? You listen to the news too much. He wouldn't have made it, he didn't have what it takes. How would you know? Do you know many statesmen, Claire? He had no end of powerful friends, but the state, the passion of the state, requires something else entirely. Something Dalème didn't have? You know, you're a lot like him. That's not a compliment. Why did you seek me out again? I think that's obvious. Grow up, Claire. Learn to see what's worth seeing. You won't get this chance again. After a heavy-handed eviction of a squat by the police yesterday afternoon in Arceaux, confrontations sprung up between youths and law-enforcers. This squat, reputed to house immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, was the site of a raid that witnesses say was "uncalled for". In this town, which has seen its share of violent outbursts, yesterday's evacuations were like a match to a powder keg. Rumours are running wild, like one which states soldiers were present at the raid. This rumour was denied by Seine Saint-Denis Town Hall, but this only enflamed the locals' resentment, who are living like resistance fighters against an occupying army. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you Pierre? - That's me. - I called you this morning. - Right. - Can we talk for a bit? - Sure. - Sorry, I'll be right back. - No need to worry. It seems that during the raid, soldiers were present? Soldiers? That's what they're saying on TV. I didn't see them, and I was there. How long were you in custody? I got out this morning. Others are still there, mostly Blacks, Africans. Apparently, they're after someone, a young guy. They grilled me for five hours. What was his name? Jefferson? Jackson? I don't remember. They asked everyone the same question. So, was Jefferson there? I couldn't tell you, I only come here twice per week. Here, people come and go non-stop. - You'd best talk to Djibril. - Okay. Only Djibril has been immediately tried. You're not close enough to see him. What's the story with this kid? It's not just the police looking for him. A guy came here this morning, with an English accent... Bates... Bates, that's it. I hope that helps. - Thanks. - No problem. His name is Jackson Odhiambo. I know he's being sought by the police and the army. You're very well informed. Mr Malisewski, I've been doing this for 25 years. I know people in governments and administrations. And when were you going to tell me this? Honestly, I wasn't planning on telling you. I'm not very trusting, not of you, but that woman, your friend. Doesn't she work for the President? According to my sources, Jackson Odhiambo was one of the refugees sent to France. From Niyamalinga? - This morning, that was a rumour. - But that was this morning. How are you going to find him? The police haven't caught him yet, so we've found him a new spot with people who speak his language. And you know all the African squats in and around Paris? - Do you have a guy to interpret? - A lady. Did French doctors give him the medication? Yes, they were in the French sector of the camp, and the doctors spoke French. Did they give this medication to everyone? No, only people in the same sector, around 50 people. The doctors said this medication would make them feel less hungry. After that, did people start to get sick? Everyone who took the medication slowly became sick. The doctors were very worried and bothered. One night, soldiers came for them. They said they would take them somewhere where they could be better cared for. They loaded them into trucks. It was night, it was very late. Only French soldiers were with them. - They were then flown to France. - Where in France? He says it was a military base, barracks. Not very large. Not many soldiers. Could he show us? Do you think he's telling the truth? He hasn't lied to us yet. Secret medical testing, in a place like Buyende? Why not? If these tests were covered up by the army, the Defence Minister would have known about it. Sallenave? He's one of Rohmerieu's puppets. If these were medicinal tests, there'd be a pharmaceutical group. A French group. If the state was complicit... There are only two French groups: Syntholis and Argos-Foissac. I have to get back. - Aren't you coming with us? - No. That's him, the guy next to Dalème. - Him? - Yes, do you know him? - Why are you interested in him? - His name is Patrick Avedikian. He's the R&D Head at Argos-Foissac. I checked the Health Ministry logs. He went to Buyende six times with Dalème. Argos-Foissac is a client of yours, you manage their communications. I don't understand, you said this was urgent... Martin, there were meetings between Dalème and Argos-Foissac. So? The Health Minister and a pharmaceutical group! - I imagine they did want to meet! - You know that's not what I meant. Wait, are you insinuating something? Dalème and Argos-Foissac were both your clients, right? I think we've said all that needs to be said. Excuse me, I have a meeting. Miss Portier? Claire Ferran. No, please! Don't hang up! If you refuse to talk to me, you're putting yourself in danger! Hello? She's just left, yes. I don't know, but it doesn't seem right. No, I said nothing! Do you think I'm an idiot? This is the place, but he doesn't want to get out, he's very scared. It's not worth him staying here if he's going back to the squat. What about us? We wait for nightfall. Do you know who did this? They found what they were looking for. My bank details. And a key to a bank safe. The campaign funds. Well, the pre-campaign. Dalème? It happened in Deniker's office, at the end of the day. Kraft paper envelopes. I was terrified going into the car park with them. - How much was inside them? - Different amounts. 5000 or 10,000, the largest had 25,000. What did you do with them? - A safe in my mother's name. - Where was the money from? A man named Avedikian. A suit, he was in his fifties, he gave me the envelopes. Do you know who he is? Yes. Are you expecting company? If they were here, they've cleaned up. Not completely. Freeze! On your knees! You are in a military zone! This is off-limits to the public! - What are you doing? - Easy now! Nights out with you are great fun. We want to know what you were doing here! If I'm being detained, I want to see a lawyer. What did you want at the military base? I don't have to answer you. I want to see Mr Antony Newman, from the embassy. He's been informed. Would you like to make a statement while you wait? What are you talking about? What have you done with Miss Portier? You came into her house like cowboys! What have you done with her? Answer me! I asked what you've done with her! We're not here to discuss Miss Portier. I've had a long conversation with Mr Métivier. He understands our point of view. The boy, Jackson, we don't want to hurt him. We want to send him home. Sorry, I didn't bring croissants. What time is it? Early. You say nothing will happen to the boy. Why should I believe you? We brought those people to France to treat them, Claire, far from prying eyes. Now they're back on their feet, there's no reason to keep them. Are they going back home? Buyende? No, of course not. Somewhere else, a friendly, neighbouring country, until things calm down back home. And what makes you think they won't talk? The money we've given them, and that we'll keep giving them, as compensation. France is a generous country which pays for its mistakes. Let me tell you one thing, Claire. If I had to deal with Dalème, I'd have thrown him to the wolves, the media and the courts. But the President left him to hang. I'll let you two, you have a lot to discuss. It was Dalème, Nicolas. Alone? Without Rohmerieu? Argos-Foissac gave the money to Dalème. They financed his campaign against Rohmerieu. They set up a phony NGO. That way, they could visit the Buyende camp as they pleased. If it went according to plan, nobody would have known. When people started dying, Dalème panicked. He called the President for help, but it was too late. Rohmerieu covered for his mate Dalème! He erased any trace of the operation! What else would you have had him do? A refugee camp, a humanitarian aid mission run by the UN! Could you imagine the scandal? Claire, you can't let this slide. Not now. - What else could I do? - You could speak out. About what? We have no proof! You can't do this, you can't. - You do it then! - This isn't about me! Don't act as if you don't understand! I'm sorry. Claire, for fuck's sake. We have the boy, Jackson, he's the proof! Alan Bates told them where he was. What? His NGO... He worked for the British Secret Service. How do you think he was so well connected? We can't do anything, Nicolas. We've got nothing, absolutely nothing. It's over. Are you going back home? Tomorrow morning, I've a 10 am flight for New York. So? - How does the truth feel? - About your husband's death? Shaï told me Rohmerieu had offered him a job as a UN Ambassador. New York, as a punishment? It could have been worse. Nobody knew. Everything went back to normal. Are you looking for a reason for the suicide? He did have a conscience, in spite of his actions. That infamous night, the 25th, Cipriani told him everything. He had found out everything, except the most important part, of course. He thought Frédéric didn't know. He wanted to warn him. The state he came back in... Poor Frédéric. I had never seen him like that. Did he warn Rohmerieu? Yes. The next day, Cipriani went up in smoke. Do you believe in coincidence? He found out about my liaisons with Jacques. He forgave me. We were supposed to make a fresh start. Turn the page. But Cipriani's death... he couldn't easily forget that. He left me this... before killing himself, in front of Jacques. It was a way of tying up loose ends. Jacques got him into politics... Jacques was the one who gave him that illness. His suicide was a murder attempt. Killing the President, politically, with the scandal. Perhaps. But he didn't count on you. With your idea about the cancer. He left me this with the letter. You've earned the right to see it. It's all in there, memos, emails, the accounts, Argos-Foissac, Africa... Rohmerieu's rescue, everything. You could shake it all up, if you wanted. No, François... Don't fuck about, you can't do this! Did you read my report or not? So? What? Yeah, I know... All the clues are there! It's just... Why can't you publish it? Do you read what they put online every single day? Since when was the site's reputation your problem? François, are you still a real reporter? Fuck you then! Fuck! When you see this message, I'll be... I can't bear the weight of this truth alone, without you. I don't want to drag you into the scandal either. But what else can I do? Perhaps, in time, when you reflect back on all this... you will understand what I did and what I wanted to achieve. Perhaps you'll change your mind. Anyway, it's all there, on that USB stick. Argos-Foissac, the money transfer, the tests in Africa... Deniker, Avedikian, all of it. Do with it what you like, whatever you think is right. I trust you. Sweetheart? Somebody is here for you. He wants to see you. The Constitutional Council declared, this morning, the definitive results of the Presidential election, after one of the most violent campaigns of recent times, marked by low-blows and dirtied with rumours, Jacques Rohmerieu is elected President for his second consecutive term, with 51.15% of the total votes cast. Sure... Don't tell me you've got stage fright. To be honest, Jacques, this really isn't my kind of thing. Receiving the Legion of Honour isn't a "thing", it's a Republican ritual. All my advisors went through this, and so shall you. I saw Domergues this morning. He doesn't want the Industry post, but didn't say no to the Chancellery. Why not Economy Minister or Prime Minister while he's at it! Did you tell him the post was already taken? NICOLAS MALISEWSKI STATE SECRETS Did he send this to you? Yes, it tickled me slightly. It's not always the thought that counts. Come on, you'll see. That bad time will soon be behind you. You've been effective, that book could have hurt me. I warned him, he had nothing concrete, no proof. A bomb exploding without making any sound, you're a genius bomb disposal expert, Claire! You know, that tragedy left a mark on me. The difference is, I can't write a book on it. I have my side of the truth, but those things would hurt me. That your friend could suggest that I had anything to do with the death of poor Cipriani... It was a fire, it was an accident. Nobody took the murder theory seriously. Even Cipriani's sister didn't believe it. But you, Claire. You. Your opinion matters to me. This in particular affair, your opinion matters most of all. I believe you, Jacques. Of course I believe you. You're no killer. That pendant, it's... It's a present from Marianne. She gave it to me before she left. It seems she's getting married next month. She lives in San Francisco, with a doctor, I believe. You'll do fine. Are you ready? I'm ready.
