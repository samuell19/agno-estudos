You don't think I'll do it, do you? But I love you and I feel creative today. (Alta groans) What do you say? Should we really blow their minds? (gun bangs) Alta's death was a tragedy.

And now here's the local news with Lyle Wheeler. (water splashing) - [Lyle] Chief of Manhattan Detectives Alfred Case accepted the theory that Ms. Lee had committed suicide. Case cited the actress's history of mental illness among other causes of the tragedy. Alta Lee had gained fame as a sex symbol in her recent films, many of which were X-rated. - [Reporter] Shock and surprise continued in the motion picture world today, following actress Alta Lee's apparent suicide. Close friends expressed amazement that she would take her own life. Ms. Lee had gained stardom as a sex symbol in recent films, most of them X-rated. Her body was discovered early this morning in the Manhattan townhouse of producer Max Pavell. Earlier today Channel Eight News filmed an exclusive statement by Max Pavell in his Wall Street office. Here now is that film. - Alta's Death was a tragedy. She had everything to live for. I'll always remember the way she looked in her movies.

(radio clicks) (door clicks) Have the police called yet? - No. - Well, they're going to. - What should I tell them? - Who were you with last night? - I was alone. - Well, from now on you were with me all night you understand? - Max, have I ever let you down? (ominous music) - You wanna know how it happened? - No. I already know how it happened. (ominous piano music) (ominous music) (button clicks) (knob clicks) - [Coroner] This is an autopsy report. 5225G. A female Caucasian aged 24. The bullet entered through the mouth and exited through the occipital portion of the skull. The path of the projectional is confirmed by powder burns on the pallet and a small wound of entry and a larger wound of exit. The pallet is perforated just to the left of the midline. There is very little blood in the subarachnoid space, which certainly indicates that death was instantaneous. She really did a job on herself. (knob clicks) (button clicks) - I don't wanna hear another word about that bitch. Oof, all I've heard was Alta, Alta, Alta. Well, she's dead and I'm glad. What about that? (groans) Oh, I got one of those headaches. - I'll take care of that. (Helene and Oliver chuckling) - That feels divine. - It's an old Hungarian remedy. They do it to their horses. - Ah. God, Oliver, you're such a man. (Helene giggles) - Uh, baby, did you talk to Max? - What do you think I have a headache for? - Did you ask me about my part? - Oh, now don't be a bore, Oliver. I don't want to talk about movies. (giggles) - It was just a thought. - Come on, keep massaging. Keep massaging. Ah, nice thing what they did to me those two. Oh, can you imagine to be the chairman of the Springtime in Paris Ball at the Plaza and have your own husband waltz in with a sex queen from the Bronx? God when I think I made that man and you know it. Why if it wasn't for me, he'd still be peddling stops up in Rochester. - [Oliver] Okay, okay, okay, I didn't mean to upset you. - Oh, get off your ass, Oliver. Get me another stinger. - [Girl] I love you, daddy. - I love you too, sweetheart. - Goodnight, Mommy. - Goodnight, darling. - How's the diet coming, Gus? - Pretty well, I guess. - You know when you start in jail you've gotta take a physical. Take all your clothes off. That can be pretty embarrassing if you're overweight, Gus. They all stand around and watch you try to do chin-ups, but the worst part is the step test. You step on and off a bench for five solid minutes. That can be torture, Gus, even if you're in good shape. You don't wanna be embarrassed, do you, Gus? - I just went off the diet today. I was cramming for a French test all night. - You're not really happy in school, are you? - Well, no. - Max, now really. - All that cramming won't teach you everything. What do you know about handling people? That's what really counts. Only money can teach you that, Gus. - Max, would you please leave the boy alone? - We're only having a man-to-man talk, right, Gus? Now I know I'm not around here much anymore. Your sister's lawyer see to that. - Bring on the violence. - And I know how conscious your sister is of money, so I'd like to help out. - Max, please. - I'm writing you a check for $5,000. I want you to spend it. - Gee. Thanks, Uncle Max. I'll, I'll put it in the bank or, or I'll buy some stock. - [Max] Oh, no, you won't. You'll spend it now. - I don't understand, Uncle Max. - Yeah, buy something you think is beautiful. - Beautiful? - Cash that check in the morning and use it, Gus. Now if you excuse us, I think your sister has something she wants to tell me. Probably wants to thank me. - Okay. Thanks, Uncle Max. Goodnight, Helene. - Goodnight. Max, this is the lowest, the absolute bottom. Oh, I know that you can barge in here once a week, the lawyers say so, but I wanna tell you one thing. If you play any of your tricks on Gus, I'm going to slit your throat. What the hell are you smiling about? - Are you threatening me? - [Helene] You bet I am. - Well, that's why I'm smiling. You be careful. You know what'll happen to you if you hit me. - Max, you don't scare me anymore. - Maybe that's why I left you. - Go get the hell out of here. Go and make another sex film. - Oh, remember, we call them art films. (film reels ticking) (gentle upbeat music) (gentle brooding music) (switch clicks) (lighter clicks) (lighter clicks) - Listen, Andy, lunch is out. O-U-T, out. I told you it's talent scout time. I'm stuck on a cunt hunt. I don't know what she's looking for. All I know is I'll be eating lunch out of a doggy bag. Hmm, you too. Bye. (phone thuds) - What do you think of Wendy Woodland? - She's a pig. - Okay. What do you think of this one? This here. - She's a good actress. - Come on, she really is a pig. - Well, that too, darling. Listen, it would help if you would tell me what you're looking for. What is it you want? Max? - Yes, he's starting a new one. (Roderick laughing) - Oh really? You should have told me. - Okay, we know he is not sentimental. - Well, neither are you. Well, I didn't think you were looking for another Alta. A substitute. - Oh no, there'll never be another Alta. - Not unless I comb the BMT again. (both laughing) (funky music) - Let's see, you're Wendy Woodland. - Sure. - I'm casting for a new film. - Here I am. - There's a lot of nudity in the film. - I don't mind if it's in good taste, but I don't do insertions and I do not even do simulated fellatio. - The two girls love the same guy, but they wind up with each other. - Oh my God, that's the story of my life. - Oh, I can see you've had a lot of experience. - Right, I've had that Hollywood shit. I've been under contracting all of it. But now I know who I am. I'm a very healthy person. - The sex is in good taste. - Oh, well listen, a fuck is a fuck. What do you think of these babies?

But I'll do anything to be an actress. - Really? - Oh yes, I'll work 24 hours a day. - Won't your boyfriend mind? - No, I mean, I don't have one. - Well, Julie, perhaps we'll call you back. (slow tempo brooding music) Hello, Max, are you going to be in town next week? No. I'm planning a little surprise for you. (laughs) No, don't worry. It's going to be something beautiful. All right, Max. Bye-bye. (phone clicks) (fast tempo ominous music) - Mr. Allen. Mr. Pavell can take your call now. - Finally. He's a very busy man. Hi, Max. How you doing? - No complaints. How about you, Ben? - I got a squash card at five. Would you like to play? - No, I'll have to pass it up. I'm gonna work out now. - I hate to bother you, Max, but it's really important. Are you there? Sounds like somebody's with you. - No, no, no. You have my undivided attention. - I've got the terms right here, Max. - Oh, well, why don't you read them to me? - They're going to buy 500,000 shares and your, the company's also agreed to sell for 1 cent for warrant to the underwriter. Negotiable warrants to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock. - Right. - [Ben] Now, you'll have to stay outta the, stay outta the, you have to keep a low pro profile here because the FCC can get into the act and then we're really in trouble. - What? - This can take care of our whole year of ordinary work. Max, it's a beautifully structured deal. You can't miss. I'm taking a piece of it myself, although I have to stay in the background. As for the far as the blue sky laws are concerned, don't worry, we've got a blue to the sky, and every state in the union, including Alaska. - [Max] Mm-hmm. - It may be pie in the sky, but the investors, Max, are going to take it. Absolutely. They're gonna grab it. (Secretary groaning) Uh, usually.I don't speak this way, but this is one of the most unusual things I think that's ever occurred to you. Now, one thing more, Max, the police, uh, uh, called. I know how you feel about them, Max, but as your attorney. - Tell them to stop up this afternoon. I'll be happy to cooperate. Oh, and by the way, tell him to call up Camila Stone. - You still friendly with her? - I was Tuesday night. - Well, that's a big help, Max. - Friends are there to help. - You sure about the squash? - So long, Ben. - Okay, I'll have to play with myself. (slow tempo brooding music) - Um, Mr. Stone. - Ms. Stone. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. I got one question to ask you. - [Camila] Go right ahead, officer. - Well, it's, it's, it's very personal, but I have to know, can you tell me where Max Pavell was last Tuesday night? - Of course, we spent the night in my apartment. - Were you on intimate terms with this gentleman? - You mean, did we fuck? - Oh my God. - Max and I have been lovers for the last three years. The last time that we had what you call intimate relations was Tuesday night, all night. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - Listen, ma'am, can I ask you another question? - If you like, officer. - We have information that this gentleman was also having an intimate relationship with the deceased. - You mean, did they fuck? - Yeah. - Max and Alta were lovers for the past year and a half. - Maybe I'm getting outta the line but didn't it bother you? - As a matter of fact, it did bother me, but not in the way you think. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. (fast tempo rock music) (door clicks) (group chattering) - Hey, hey, look at this. Oh, that's all right. He wouldn't know anything about that. Hey, here's one, a swinging girl, 36, 22, 42 expert at French culture. (giggles) Available for bizarre parties with rough dominant men. That's you buddy. - Think so? - No, I mean it. Yeah. Exotic pleasure guaranteed. - Exotic sick. - Ah, it's no good. It says Michigan area only. Gee. - Hey. - Huh? - [Detective Schwartz] You wanna see something? - Yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. - The fingerprint boys pulled this out of her, that suicide gal's laundry. (nose sniffing) Take a whiff. (nose sniffing) - Whew. I think I'm in love. - Did you ever see her pictures? - Hey, hey, what about the boyfriend? Did you call him? - Yeah, he's clean. He's got some other broad somewhere. You oughta see her. I'd love to get ahold of some of her laundry. - Hey, what'll I do with this? - Put in with the Puerto Rican's undershirt. - The Puerto Rican. (both laughing) (slow tempo brooding music) (traffic humming) - So this is the new place. Dola, you've done wonders. - Well, I haven't got everything here yet. Do you like the mirror? - Where? (Camila laughing) Like it, I love it. - Would you like a drink? - Ah, actually, no. I haven't got a lot of time. What is it you wanted, Dola? - Well, you know, I wouldn't have called your office if it wasn't really important. - Just tell me. It's been a long day. Everybody wants something today. What do you want? - We're still friends, aren't we? - Sure, we're all friends. And New York is a big friendly city. Now what do you want, Dola? - I've gotta have $7,000. - Well, how do you want it, small bills or large? - I'm not kidding. They're gonna kill me. - Dola, Dola, that was your trouble as an actress. You were always too melodramatic. Even Max saw it. - Listen, you owe me something. If it hadn't been for me, you never would've met Alta. Look, Alta went up, I went down. I didn't ask for anything. Nobody gave a shit about me. - You don't enjoy your work. Oh, stop that. - They're going to kill me. - I could get the money in 10 days. - Half then, I could stall him with half. - What do I get for it? - What do you want? What can I give you? - I don't know yet. I'd have to think about it, say for 10 days. You get your money in 10 days. - Are you sure? - Dola, Dola, have I ever let you down? - No. - In the meantime, if you need some cash, why don't you sell some of this tacky furniture? - The people who come here like it. - They would.

You just step over a line. Look, all your life, you've been going on interviews. - Mm-hmm. - You've been smiling, now you're going to use more than just your face. People like it.

Oh, I'm shocked already. - I was living with Janie, she's a dancer. And we had these two boys over for dinner. We cooked Indian food, and listened to records, and they brought some pot, you know? Anyway, Janie went into an alcove with her boy, and the other boy and I were lying on the sofa, just a mattress on the floor. I went to the bathroom for a minute, and when I came back, he was naked, just lying there, smiling, and smoking. He was excited. I mean, he was erect. I could feel his energy or something. But not just him, but Janie and the other boy in the same room. The, the feeling of the vibrations, it was blinding. And afterwards, he went down on me and I started pushing up against him. God, it was so hot, everything was wet. I didn't have the strength to move. And afterwards we talked about sex and I told him how I got off when I was alone. Then he wanted to see me. I guess, I guess that was really the climax, the two of us just lying there, floating and touching ourselves. I don't know. Maybe it was the pot, but everything was so fantastic. I still think about the boy sometimes. I think, I think he went to Florida. I always wondered if he felt it too. Everything was perfect that night.

Are you jealous? - No, I'm interested. - Does it give you a little thrill? - I don't know much about those things. - Hmm, she liked lilac oil. Let's finished now. We'll forget about Alta. Move on to what's really important. (ominous music) I want to rehearse this scene with you. It's the one I told you about with the gun. You'll do it in the movie or maybe here with us. - I don't understand. - Just do as I tell you, Julie. - I'll try. - May seem dangerous. A lot of people would be afraid, but you'll be fine. - Well, I wanna trust you. - Okay, Julie. You're in a large gray room, it's very dark. There's a big Persian rug on the floor. You're seated on a black leather sofa. Over there you see a man, he's sitting in an armchair. He tells you to stand up to undress. You obey. Get up, Julie. Take off your vest. He's going to ask you to hand him a bottle of perfume. You hand it to me. (gentle brooding music) Now he'll tell you to kneel in front of him. You know exactly what he's going to do. Look at me. Flowers, sweat. Now you're afraid he'll stop. But then he goes on. He tells you to get the gun. Sometimes it's in a drawer, sometimes on the table. Get it. (bullets clanging) Use all six bullets. Take off the safety. (gun clicking) Cock it. (gun clicks) Now come over here and lie down. Whatever happens, whatever he wants, you feel nothing. You're in love. The more you submit, the more you show it. Now, he'll ask for the gun. He'll remind you it's loaded. - No, please. - Stop that. What do you feel? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. - Louder. - Nothing! - He'll say that he loves you. - No. - And use the gun everywhere. But you won't make a sound. (Julie whimpering) That's it. Keep still. Then later he'll put the gun in your mouth and you'll taste yourself. Imagine him beside you. He could do anything. - No, I can't. - Stop that! - Look, look, you know this isn't a movie. I can't do this. - You are hopeless, aren't you? - [Julie] Please listen to me, I'm not Alta, I'm me. (hand slaps) (Julie groans) - You're whatever I say you are and now you're finished! (Julie grunting) - Oh, you're hurting me. - Take your things and get out! - Ow. - Did you think that these were real? (gun clicking) There, try and murder me. (Julie laughs) - I don't believe. Camila, hey! Look, I didn't know what you were doing. I'm, I'm really sorry. This is, this is ridiculous. - Doesn't matter. - You mean I don't have to go? - No, you don't have to go. (Julie laughs) - I don't know, we're both tired. We should relax, take a bath, do something. I don't know. Anyway no one ever said you were Alta. How does that feel? - Oh, fantastic. - I know, it's the lilac that does it. - Oh, it's really nice. - [Camila] Move over, I wanna get in too. - Is there room for two? - Turn around, I'll take it back. - Okay. Oh, it's so nice. It's so big. Gosh. - Your sweet skin. No taste good. (Julie giggles) (Julie moans) - Mm, that feels good. (gentle music) No. - Easy, easy. Tomorrow I want you to meet someone important. You do just as I say. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to turn someone on. You're going to get what you want, Julie. (fast tempo ominous music) (traffic humming) (car horns honking) (car horn honking) (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (car horn honking) (door clicks) (door bangs) (birds chirping) (car horn honking) Uh, Max. Max. Was that one lump or two? - Two. - It's funny, but I can never remember. Here you are, Max. (siren wailing) - Thank you. - Just the way you like it. You know Julie, Max was very impressed with the Mahopac Repertory Company. - We're always searching for new talent. - Well, I hope Camila didn't exaggerate. - Impossible. If there's one person in the world I trust, it's Camila. - I think Julie would be terrific for your new movie. - She's very pretty, but we'd have to test her. - Oh, naturally. - She has a lovely body. And you won't have any trouble with her on the set. - That's good. - I mean, she's not shy, Max. Julie, show Max your legs. - Yes, please do. - Julie's been exercising a lot. You can tell by the muscle tone. Do you see? - Do you mind? - Please do. (fast tempo ominous music) - She's very trim, isn't she? - Yes and no underpants. - Yes, I know what that means to you. Julie, stand up. I want to show Max something. Come on, dear, he's waiting. Max, you, you haven't tried my cupcakes. They're delicious. - I think I'll start with a cookie. - Oh yes, they're good too. I bought them myself. - Can Julie take direction? - I'll show you. Julie, go and bower Max's flower. - I can't? - I'd feel naked without it. - Max, you'll get it back. - All right. By the way, you were right about the cookies. Delicious. - Yes, you can eat as many as you like. They're organic. - No artificial preservatives. - Turn around, Julie. Remember Max, I promised you something beautiful. Now you'll see how she takes direction. I don't want you to cry out, Julie. We don't want people looking down from all those nasty windows, do we? (siren wailing) (bird chirping) (Julie gasps) Perfect. The flower, Julie. Max, you're going to enjoy this. Julie thought of it herself. And wait till you see her on screen. (film reel ticking) (film reel rattling) (switch clicks) - It's uncanny. - Max, have I ever let you down? - It is Alta. - [Camila] No. Julie is quite herself. - Come here, Julie, I have something to tell you and it's very important. I'm going to change your life. - You don't have to tell me anything as long as I'm with Camila. - Oh, you'll both be coming. I want you to forget your past, never return to your apartment, not even the move out. Leave everything as it is, and come with us. From now on everything will be different. (ominous music) (door clicks) (door bangs) (Gus spits) - My brother's really very sensitive. He, he's such a good boy. (sighs) If you would only talk to him. I mean, you wouldn't have to touch him, just talk to him. I really don't know how it happened but he loves you. I'm sure of it. Oh God, don't you remember the first time you were in love? (phone ringing) - Excuse me. (phone clicks) Hello? - Hello, Dola. Wait, don't hang up, please. It's me. You know who this is? - Mrs. Pavell, I think you should listen to this. There's someone wants to talk to you. - You don't even have to touch me, just, just talk to me. Now, all, all that I wanna know is what's it like with Max? Just tell me that. What does he make you do? Come on, please tell me. I, I've never been in love before. - I have a prediction to make, that we're gonna be together for a long, long time. Just the three of us. - Like a little family. - I'd like that. - Don't be too sure. There's certain things you have to do in a family. - Oh, no, no, no, no, Camila, I'll tell her. I'll show you how we treat family. I'll be back in a moment. - I love you. Do you love me? (Julie moans) (Julie moans) - Of course I love you. - The way you loved Alta? - No, you're another person. - I've done everything you've wanted. What more? My hair, these rings, my clothes. - Alta was a lot more than just a wig and rings. - You've changed me completely. I, I'm not even myself anymore. God, I, I don't know who I am. - I don't know either. But you are certainly not Alta. - I am Alta. And I love you the way she did! We both know it! I love you! I love you, you, you hear me! I love you! (Julie yelling) - You know where he's going, don't you? He's going to get the gun. He wants to play a little scene with you. That's all right, you've rehearsed it. You're ready. - What you mean? - I can't help you now, you're on your own. You can do what you want. - I'm, I'm just, I don't understand. - When Max brings the gun, you can submit. That's what Alta did. Of course, you might be luckier than she was. It all depends. - What are you talking about? - When you give Max the gun, you give him your life. He might take it. That's what happened to Alta. In the end, she was just something for Max to use. He killed her right here. - No, that's not true. - [Camila] He blew the top of her head off. - [Julie] No, he, he couldn't get away with that. - Sure he could. - I was his alibi. - You've been lying to me all along. (Julie crying) - I've been preparing you to choose. Think about something, Julie. What if there never was a film for you? What would you do then? - We are going to have an entertainment. (ominous music) Come over here. I feel happy tonight. I love you. I love you both. - I think she's worried. - What's the matter? - A little touch of paranoia. - Don't be afraid. This is your house. - She looks feverish. Don't move, Julie. (Julie whimpering) - Undress her. Get her ready for bed. - I think she wants to run. - How foolish. Don't you know we love you. Everything that happens in this room, everything that's going to happen tonight is because we love you. - I've dressed her in Alta's clothes. It's a shame to take them off. Do you like the rings? - Alta's slave rings. - No, just a copy. She's not helping. - Then encourage her. - I've made her up like a little whore. She's so sensitive. All I have to do is touch her. She's a perfect little pro, don't you think? That's what we like about her, she can be anything that we want. - Finish undressing her. I want her naked. (zipper zipping) (Julie moans) - [Julie] (moaning) Oh, yeah. (Julie moaning) - Did you bring the perfume? - [Camila] It's on the table. - Julie, get the perfume. Now bring it to Camila. - She's wondering why she obeys, but she's trained. Think, Max, she's afraid and humiliated, but she's proud. - Put on the perfume, Camila. Come here, Julie. Kneel down. Kneel down before me. - Said to kneel. - No. (hand slapping) (Julie groaning) Oh, oh. - Take the gun, Julie. It's a police revolver. It can blow a hole in someone as big as a peach. - No. - [Max] Take it I say. Can she load it? - [Camila] She knows well enough. - [Max] Then do it. - Clumsy. Give me those. I'll do it. Safety off? - Yes. And cock it. - Will you use it on her? - Of course. - I have a better idea. Let her use it on herself. She's dying for it. - All right. Take the gun, Julie. If you pull on the trigger, it will kill. You could kill me or I could kill you. You decide. - No. - Never say no to me! Now take the gun. I want you to use it on yourself. - He means he wants to watch. - Why do you hate me? I'm not Alta. - I don't hate you. We both love you. - I told you, Julie. - There's no further to go. No greater love. You'll be grateful in the end. - No. - Believe him. He knows what he's doing. - [Max] If you don't want to play the game then give the gun. Or you stop me. Show me how much you love me. - Get away! - Give me the gun, Alta! Make a point. You decide! - The gun, Alta. Alta, the gun. (Julie screaming) The gun. (gun bangs) (Julie screaming) Killed Max. The police will be here later. You better think about what to say. - I don't wanna talk. You talk to them. - I won't be here. - What? - I haven't been here all night. How could I? I slept with someone else last night. A very dear old friend. We had a marvelous time. - Camila, what are you talking about? You, you've got to help me. - Tell them how Max tried to use you. They'll understand. - Why are you doing this to me? - I told you I loved Alta. You were just some girl I used to take care of Max. I trained you for this moment. Now it's over. Goodbye, Julie. - Camila, please, please don't, please don't go. You can't leave me alone. You can't walk out on me. - It's the easiest thing I've ever done. - What about me? - You? You killed your lover in some stupid quarrel, but it doesn't matter. You see, my lover died some time ago. - I don't wanna hear about Alta! - I suppose not. She knew a lot more about love than you ever will. Goodbye, Julie. (ominous music) (door bangs) (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (tire squeaks) (car door bangs) (knuckles tapping) - Who is it? - [Camila] It's me. (door clicks) - Did you bring it? Is that it? (door bangs) Did you bring it? - 7,000 as promised. - I can't thank you enough. - Yes, you can. When the police call. - [Dola] The police? - They're going to ask you where I was last night. I was with you all night. - That's all you want. - It means a lot to me, Dola. - Okay, honey. - Are you sure? - Trust me, Camila. Have I ever let you down?
