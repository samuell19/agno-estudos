Our next lot, ladies and gentlemen, is a beautiful painting by the legendary painter Widajat, called The Wilderness. Dimensions: 110 by 125 centimeters. I'll start at 700 million rupiah. Seven hundred million. Thank you, lady number 24. Seven hundred and fifty million. Thank you, gentleman number 31. Eight hundred million. Mr. Oliver, thank you, sir. Mr. Oliver with 800 million. -Raise, now. -Eight hundred and fifty million. Thank you to gentleman number 19. Eight hundred and fifty million. Hold it. Hold. A painting with countless mysteries behind it. Did I hear 900 million? -Mr. Robert! With 900 million rupiah! -Get ready to raise. How about 950 million rupiah? There's a mystery behind it. -It would look beautiful on display. -Fake? Nine hundred and fifty million, ladies and gentlemen? That's good. All right. Nine hundred million going once. Do you know the master forger? Nine hundred million going twice. Nine hundred million going thrice. Sold to Mr. Robert. Thank you. Piko, Dini has sent the 50 million to my crypto. Since the market is on the rise, do you want to wait, or… Ucup, sorry I can't wait. My tuition fee is due this month. Okay. I'll close it and send it to you right away. All right, I'm going to the visiting room. Bye. Ucup, I don't know how you get your hands on these things. Awesome. By the way, don't forget my Bob Dylan harmonica. Just pay for that one first. Harmonica is easy-peasy. Okay. I'll transfer it now. Here you go. -No problem. -Coffee, Ucup? Hey, thanks. -I should go now. -What? What's the rush? -I thought you wanted the Bob Dylan thing. -You got it already? -That's crazy. -Yep! Hey, Lan! Put everything on my tab. -Hey, thanks, Man. -No worries. Veggies! Veggies! LEGAL ACTION BEING TAKEN OVER LAND AND BUILDING! Oh no! Stop! Piko! Cut the power! Now! All good? It should be. That's never happened before. I wonder too. Hey. Why didn't you tell me that Sarah was there? I felt bad. You know her. She hates it when she doesn't know what I'm doing. What's so bad about being friends with her anyway? Do you have the money to pay for the meal here? I can't chip in for now. Don't worry. You just sit down and enjoy the meal. Ucup and I just hit the jackpot. If you keep yourself busy with Ucup all the time, when will you finish your final project? You said you didn't want to pay the tuition fees anymore. You wanted to hold an exhibition in a gallery. -Sarah… -The offer is right in front of you. What's in front of us now is an expensive and delicious meal. Are you sure you don't want to finish it first? We don't come from wealthy families. We can't just relax while waiting for our parents to send us money. I should join the National Sports Week so they continue giving me the scholarship and I can start my thesis. You? You've struggled, paying for tuition. You're just going to let it go down the drain at the end? What I'm trying to build with Ucup will give me a settled life. It's always Ucup. Why is he always involved in the things that you're not telling me? What a perfect dinner. Guys, sorry for being late. Thank goodness you've ordered something. I'm starving. Let me have some. Is our athlete on a diet? Why aren't you eating? Here, just eat everything. Thanks, Sarah. Anyway. National Sports Week is in four months. You must be doing heavy training. What about you and your fake goods? All going smoothly there? You don't filter your words, do you? I don't sell fake stuff, Sarah. All my stuff is original but affordable. So it's not only the rich that can afford that kinda stuff. Is there anything you want? I have everything. Don't worry, just tell me and I'll find it for you. So you could see it for yourself. How's your father in Bandung? You're going right back to Jakarta after this? Won't it hurt your wallet, going back and forth here? We can look for money, Dad. It's easy. I miss you. I just don't want to be a burden to you. The older you get, the more needs you have to meet. If you keep coming every week for the next 18 years, does that make sense? You told me that you were framed. Where are your friends now? They live a nice life, going to different parties every day with hundreds of billions in their hands. If one day I see one of your friends, Uncle Retno, Uncle Rudi, if I ever see them, I will… What will you do then? There will be no end. So, this is it? There's absolutely nothing more we can do to get another appeal? I have a lawyer friend. He said he could help. But they're asking for two billion to re-open the case. Two billion? The more I think about it, the less I know what to do. I'm stuck. What is it? You know how much Dini paid us, right? 50 million? Here, your Widajat painting was bought for 900 million at auction. That means Dini got a huge profit from your work. You have forged the work of six maestros, and none of the buyers knew that those were fake paintings. What if we re-negotiate the price for our next project? Ask her for a more fair price. Three paintings would be enough. And we could help your father out. -Three? -Yes, three. Take notes. As we should. Nice. Lee Man Fong. -Hold on. -Jeihan. Sunaryo. Suharmanto. -Supriyadi. -I don't know any of them, Piko. -Come on! -Pick the more famous ones. -Just anyone! -All right, Raden Saleh! -Raden Saleh? -Why not? Him, I know! Okay. I'll gather the data now. Yes. Reporting, sir. A second report on the painting forgery case just came in this afternoon. Whose painting was the first one? Affandi. The second one was a Widajat painting. Have you gotten feedback from the National Gallery? Not yet. They would need to invite an investigator from Belgium to see whether the painting is forged. And? They don't have the budget for it. Then we can't turn this into a case. And it's not our job to investigate fake paintings. What? My father is asleep. You joining the race tonight? I'm sleepy. Lame. By the way, tell your father to pay the rent on time next month. All right. -How am I going to get in? -Just come in. Quietly. Hurry. Don't make a noise. -Hurry up! You're so slow! -All right! Won't you catch a cold if you go home by motorbike every day? -If I were you, I wouldn't… -Let it go, Grandma. Are we going to talk about this every day? What kind of life will you lead if you end up with a painter? I apologize for making you take responsibility for all this. I just wanted to say that we might only have a year left in this residence. Yes, Grandma. I'll find a way. Go! All good? Hey, wanna bet more? He's gonna win, Tuktuk. Come on. You scared? Bet more. Just go all in. He's winning. How much is it? -Three million. -You sure? Piss off. Gofar topped up for three million. -Gofar, what's happening? -What? -What is it? -The clutch is busted. Shit, seriously? Fuck! What's wrong? What happened? The clutch got busted. Might be the piston. -Maybe. -I checked it earlier. Let's find a replacement in Mangga Besar. -That's the problem. -What? I bet our last three million… Dad's going to kill us. If we keep getting ripped off like this, when are we going to open our own garage? Before you give us another job, I just want to say that we don't just need the money, but we want a fair share. Come with me. -Hendra Gunawan? -What? -Hendra Gunawan? -No. I know. Another Sudjojono? Raden Saleh. Which series? Portrait of the Sultans and VOC Officials or The Horseman? Neither. But those series' bodywork is easier to forge because both series are difficult to trace and have very messy documentation. The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro. What do you think? -Are you serious? -Yes. You're insane. Let's go. -We have a huge deal. -We'll end up in jail. This isn't a forgery. It's a replication. Yes. As detailed and identical as possible. -Ucup. -How much? Ucup! One billion in a month's time. Fair enough? Two billion. Take it or leave it. This isn't just a forgery. This is making… What did Dini say? As detailed and identical as possible. That. But, if we succeed, the money will solve your problem right away. The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro isn't just a painting. More than its high complexity of color and technique, this painting also holds a wide range of emotions and symbolism. First, the event is depicted in a vague setting. It's either morning or afternoon. Raden Saleh's protest against this fraudulent arrest can be seen from his depiction of the Dutch as dwarfs. On the other hand, take a closer look at Diponegoro. He made him look very gallant. The gesture seems as if he's challenging his captors. This is the maestro's work. This painting is such a big deal for Indonesia. Not only because Raden Saleh is our first modern art symbol, but also because this painting is a symbol of resistance. But… But why is Dini asking us to make this? Gosh, enough already. Stop overthinking. I'll bring you the last restoration data from Germany 2012 tomorrow, okay? We'll also look for the canvas. -See you, Man. -Take care. Ouch! Here's the data. -Three! -Your girl is even cooler now. -You scared? -I am. Of course you are. Where did you get these? Well… Their servers are easy to break into. So I just took everything. Is that enough? These should do. There's so much. You're awesome. Three! All right, I should go. Okay. I think I won't be able to see you for the next week or two. Really? Haven't you been gone for like a week? I'm doing my final project. You told me to, remember? Also, my lecturer can't shut up and keeps asking about my progress. Not even going out for a bite or bringing you a meal? I'm just trying to focus and eliminate distractions, that's all. Distractions? -You mean I'm a distraction? -No. So, when you said I was your muse, it was just a lie? -Yes, no. -Yes or no? -What do you mean? -Yes. No. No… Yes. No. Yes. -Sarah… -I don't get it. Sarah! -Sarah! -All right, I get it. Let's just go. I need to start the project today. Okay. I never asked you to pick me up or take me home. I can get myself a cab. Sarah. Finish your final project. I understand. Where do I put this, Piko? -Over here. -Okay. I'm going out. Where? To get some fresh air. My head's spinning that we're so far from being finished. Ucup. How's the heater? -It's difficult. -Come on, Man. -When are we going to wrap it up? -All right. I'll continue right away. Hold on. Gofar! Sorry. Can I ask you for a favor? What favor? What is it? It's here. That's fast. Take it. -Gofar! -Yep. Your package is here. Nice. -So many. -Let's unwrap them. It's safe. -Give it a try? -Yes. -It's working. -Good. Smart! Good, right? Sir! -Ucup! -What? -Turn it off, it's done! -It is? You're a genius, Pik! Good job! -It's awesome! -What are you guys doing? So, I'm just a friend for you to have a meal with? For you, dating is only about picking me up and taking me home? Are you my boyfriend or my driver? Who's your girlfriend? Me or Ucup? A moment, please! I'm talking to Piko! -Sar, I'm… -Are you asking me for a fight? Two billion, Sarah. I need two billion to take my father's case for an appeal to the Supreme Court. The one helping me is Ucup. Ucup gave me this job to forge Raden Saleh's painting. This is the only thing I could do to get that much money. You happy now? Why did you never tell me this? What for? What for, Sarah? You have National Sports Week. And you must pass or they will withdraw your scholarship. In the end, this will just add one more thing for you to worry about. What good would it do? I'm not giving you any more burdens. I'm sorry, Piko. I'm sorry too. I don't mean to disturb you. The transaction with Dini is in an hour, so we should go now. I'm coming with you. I said I'm coming. Let's go. Why is she bringing a party? Hey. This feels scary. Piko, Ucup. Hey. Who's that? Don't worry. She's my artisan. She's been with me since the first project. You're young, but you act all high by using an artisan. Is this it? I tried making this as detailed and identical as possible. Even to the canvas choice, as you can see for yourself. But what's on this surface was based on the restoration data of 2012. The rest and its condition today we have no record of it. Mr. Permadi? Very exceptional. It's like looking right into the painting I had in my old office. You did great. Are you… Piko Subiakto? That would be me. Here's 45 ETH. Two billion. -Yes. -Okay? Wait. I have a more interesting offer. I'll add 315 ETH more. That means 17 billion in total. If you can swap this painting with the original one in my office. Wait, you mean the one in the presidential palace? Two billion is nothing compared to 17 billion. But, sir, we are not thieves. When I make a plan, it's always a mature plan. All you have to do is execute it. Then, you can go with that money. Would anyone turn it down? She's right. We're not thieves. We're… just students looking for a side job. The two billion you promised us is enough. Whatever you want to do with this painting is none of my business. I want my two billion. Don! Do you know who this is? Budiman Subiakto. Isn't this your father? I can make your father suffer more. To serve his time longer. Or make him fight and die there. You don't have a choice, Piko. Three weeks from now, there will be an annual exhibition of the presidential palace's collection at the National Museum. You'll have a chance to swap the painting when it's being moved. There's 500 million rupiah there. Take it. You guys can use it as the funds to start working and to look for a crew. Let's go, Dini. Ucup. Dini's your acquaintance, right? So how could the ex-president be there? Why are you blaming me? You've been so angry all day. -How can I not be angry? -Enough! We've fucked up and now we're trapped! Piko. You're not considering it, are you? Then, what should I do, Sarah? The one who's an ex-president is Permadi. He's the one with the power. Us? What are we? Only normal citizens! We have nothing! Why? If something happens to my dad, what should I do? If what Permadi said really happens, what should I do, Sarah? I don't know why Permadi wants that painting. But, if I have to break down our situation, there are two things to be considered. The pros and cons of all this. The first pro. Uncle Budiman's problem will be cleared in no time. Two billion rupiah in one month, and he'll be safe from Permadi's threat. The second pro. How to sell the painting. There, the funds. It's right there in front of our eyes. The third one. If we succeed, we will have 15 billion left. 15 billion. But, the cons… Well, we're not thieves. I'm not saying we can't, but we don't have the experience. And second, if we get caught, we will end up like your father. The fourth pro. If we dare to do this, our safety, my dad's life, and our lives will also be safe from our mad ex-president's threats. But… But, we don't have a choice. If we can perfectly execute this, maybe we can get away with it. Aren't you scared, Sarah? Ucup. This isn't just about Piko's father. It's also about our safety. Piko, you, me, we were all there. And the money. The money can be used for my grandma. And us, Piko. Now, we need to break down the plan given by Dini and Permadi. Here, look at this. Permadi only gave us the logistics company's profile. While we need detailed information about the logistics company that the palace has been using all this time. This logistics company has been using the same route for the past 12 years. Give me time to study all of Permadi's plans. We need to know the traffic conditions at the time of delivery and find the safest point for the swap. But, we need a getaway driver. -And a mechanic who'll fulfill our needs. -Piko. Pik, where are you going? I got an idea. You think taking a customer's car to join a race is a brilliant idea? You're both idiots. Even though you have different mothers, the way you both act is identically stupid. Well, we have the same father. You dare talk back to me?! Dad, but this is BMW E30. -How could we get the money? -That's right. It's too expensive. I don't care. -Uncle! -The point is… Oh, Piko. If you're here for rent, I'm sorry. I think I'll be late paying this month's rent. It's because of these two brats. We'll talk about the rent later. Right now, I need to talk to them both. Oh. Hey. You two can't be happy just yet. Find the money to replace that engine. Okay? Hey. You need money? Follow me. So… each of us will get our own share. Three billion rupiah. Damn. We can build our own garage. But, to polish our plan, we still have to hack into the painting delivery logistic system. The problem is, This company is insanely old school. Their database isn't even on the net. Yeah… If they still do it old school, then we'll do the same. Are you serious, Ucup? Twenty minutes from now, pick us up at the safe zone. Got it. Are you sure we're using these? It's just Airsoft gel. This will be our alibi if we get caught. We will just look like some naughty brats who broke in. -Gofar, sorry. -Are you crazy? -That stings! -Stop. You're not using this, okay? Hey, where's Gofar? Gofar? Where's Gofar? Hey. What are you doing? There's no one here. -Ucup. -What? What are we looking for? The schedule or the staff list. Oh, yeah. Why are they taking so long? How should I know? Ucup, is this the right one? -There, thief! -Hey! -There's a thief! -We're busted! -Ucup! Run! -Thief! Oh, yeah! -Thief! -Wait for me, Sarah! -Thief! Don't run! -Sarah! Hey! Stop! Hey! Thief! Hey, thief! Stop! -Hey! -Sarah! -What's your name? -Faisal. You dare mess with me? Don't make me pull the trigger. Fuck, I pulled it. A toy! Come here. Hey! Come on! -Gofar! -Don't look back. Gofar! Hey! Stop right there! PT. SENO PATI EXPRESS ADMINISTRATION We need one more person, Ucup. We need someone with privilege, who has some leverage, and who at least has the resources to make changes. -Am I right? -Someone who makes more sense. More human. Smarter. A rich kid with criminal sense. And who doesn't need money. Well. Maybe someone who just wants a thriller-seeking adventure. Like Batman? A night owl? No. Crazy rich. Okay. I have the perfect candidate. Hit. You marked the cards, didn't you? It's impossible to win 12 times in a row. If you can prove that I'm cheating, take all the money in my bag. No one wants to go on? What about this? Is it not enough? Are you new here? I'm not in the mood to play with a new guy. Okay. How about this? 30 million. -Sit. Please sit. -Okay. Hit. Yes. You're scared? You're too bold. I told you, she'll play you. I like how bold you are. I understand your play style. You let your opponent win first, so they will raise the bet. Then, you'll finish them when they go all in. You're crazy. You got money to burn? What if I say yes? All in. Jeep Cherokee 1994, limited edition. I don't understand your motivation. But if you're asking me on a date by wasting money like this… Okay. What if I give you an adventure worth 2.5 billion? Can you still say that it's not your play style? So? Are you in? This is all for me, right? Okay. Gofar. -Gofar, look. -What is it? Seriously? Hey. You both are also here. Hi! What is it? Let's go. Come in. -Guys, this is Fella. -Wait. -You invited her? -Yeah. -To our team? -Yeah. What about it? You're mad. No. We both quit. Why would I be on the same team with some bookie? I'd be crazy. Sorry, Piko. I'm out. What? This girl has swindled both me and Gofar so many times. You don't want anything to do with some bookie, or you're afraid of always losing to one? -If you weren't a girl, you'd be dead. -Wow, chill. Hey. What's your deal with girls? I'm a girl too. I could kick both of your asses here if I wanted to. Hey, stop. We're here for the same reason. Money. So you're in or not? Enough. Leave your personal matters back on the race field. Sita. We have a duty to guard a national asset. No one wants to take this job, so I have to give this to you. You'll be coming with my team, okay? The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro by Raden Saleh? And so… Our chance to swap the paintings is only at the time of delivery. Actually, your plan is okay. But, there are still so many missing details. Loopholes here and there. Now, how are you guys going to get the delivery schedule if they still record it manually? Don't tell me that you've been stealthily breaking in to get the data? Gofar! Where's Tuktuk? I don't know! Stop running! Hey! Hey! Stop! Well, we were inspired by a game. Well… And? You got an idea? We need two people to infiltrate this company as staff. Not bribing the driver. You don't want to leave any traces, do you? That's why… we need you. We'll make a diploma for Gofar and Tuktuk, so they can get a job there. -Us? -Of course. Who else? INDONESIA JAYA UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA Okay. Then, do we have to get a job there ourselves? Of course not, stupid. My mom's chief of staff will take care of you two. RELIABLE FAST SHIPPING Come in, Tuktuk! To the right. To the right. Stop! -That one has this. -How is it? -Where is it? -Is this it? -Yeah. -It looks similar. Easy. Piko. Here. Can you handle that? Of course. It's me. There. You can check it. There's a red button. Press it. I'm great, right? I'm even better than Carhood. I'll be resting. I need to build the mood. Okay. I didn't take my leave last year. And I can't take it this year either. I even promised my children a trip. Well, well, well. That's the opposite for me. I just won a six-person vacation to Bali. I'm new here. I can't take any leave yet. When is the date of the vacation? January 22nd. Do you want it? I'll take care of it. Let me play this for you, okay? Hey, Ucup. Book tickets to Bali for six people. On behalf of Yudi Sugandi. Yes. How is it going? Do you know who will deliver the painting? Here. The assignment letter. Me and Gofar. Why didn't you just tell us in chat? -Yeah. -So that there's tension. Just like all those heist movies. Gofar, Tuktuk, follow me. I want to show you guys something. -What? -Come here. It's similar. -You're crazy, Piko. -Mad. You're mad. It's great. What about the engine series? Can you really do that? Patience. Don't fucking rush me. -You good? -Patience. -Pull me out. -Okay. Don't you think asking Gofar to copy the machine series is too much? I'm just fixing the loopholes in your plan. Really? I thought you were just a thrill-seeker who was secretly a narcissist and always wanted to be the center of attention. Turns out you're deceitful too. It's fun, isn't it? Looking through my digital history? My social media accounts, starting from Steller, Blogspot… What else? -Up to… -Up to your secret Instagram account. A place for your rants along with your subject pictures? So, all this time… That's what you call a strategy, Fella. What about this tunnel? Is your strategy with this tunnel as good as your strategy of flirting with me? Your house seems so quiet. Make sure you have enough rest. Okay. You too. -Are Mom and Dad home? -Not yet, miss. This will be the route. I want you to be on your guard. What could the threat be? Who would be crazy enough to steal a painting? This delivery is almost without threat. But I want the escort to be just like it has been the last two years. The escorting protocol was pioneered by Ex-President Permadi. Sir. We're coming, Ucup. Good morning, everyone. Guys. We're on standby. Relax. Calm down. Everything is under control. Three kilometers to the tunnel. 10-8 National Gallery. Code 819. Hey, we've passed the monument. Fella, Piko. -Ready? -I'm in. Ready, Sarah? Hey, you're blocking the way, miss. I'm sorry, sir. My car broke down. I don't understand why. -Are you serious, miss? -I apologize. I don't know why. Suddenly smoke's coming out of my car. You're blocking the way, miss. I'm sorry, Everyone. This… CRYPTOCURRENCY INVESTMENT MADE EASY Keep the pace, guys. The tunnel's still 200 meters away. Hey. Why are there two trucks? It's causing traffic to bank back a long way back, miss. It's an electric car. I don't understand how to fix it either. -Gosh! -Look at the traffic, miss! Ucup, it's chaos here. A lot of people are starting to help. Improvise, Fella. My car broke down, sir. Sorry! It broke down. Code 9-1 going southeast. Entering the central tunnel. There's a blockade at the end, Captain. Piko. Tuktuk. How much longer? I'm almost at the point, Ucup. Gofar, Piko is behind us. Already? I can't see him. -We clear? -Yeah. Tuktuk. I'll move in right now, okay? I'll get into position right now, okay? Piko. I'm sorry, sir. I don't know how to fix it. Wait a minute, sir. Ucup, the police are approaching. What should I do? Tuktuk, I'll move, okay? I'll overtake the car in front. Miss. Yes, sir? What happened with your car, miss? My car broke down, sir. It's the police. We were hit by the police. -By the police! -Piko, let's get away! Reverse! Hey! Abort the mission! Abort! Fella, get away from there right now. Fella! You hear me? Fella! What's going on? Just crash it! Hey! Just go! Go! Whoa! Hey! Can you help me? -Fel! -I'm sorry, Sir. It's because… -Honey! My car broke down. -What is it, honey? -Wait, let me check. -Yes, yes. Please wait, sir. -Yeah. -Wait a minute, sir. Damn! Move! Move! -Come on, Tuktuk! -Why are there three lines? Hey, move away! 363! 363! Code 363! How about the others, Ucup? What about your car? We have to find a safe place first. Then we'll find the others. -Watch out! -Go! Watch out! Sarah, let's get away. -Sarah, run! -Piko. Come on, Sarah. Run. -Sarah, run! -Stop! Piko! Ugh! Stop! Stop! Hey! -It's the police. Get away! -Where to? How can we get away? Where are you going? Shit! Watch out! Upstairs. Hey! Hey, stop! Move! This is a safe place. Here. I won't say a word to your parents. -It'll be all right. -Okay. I'll try to find more information outside. -Okay. -Okay? I think we're safe here. Does he know anything? I may have told him. Are you out of your mind? -Do you want to get caught? -I said we're safe! He's our only way of finding out what's going on outside. He's got connections. Gito works for my mom, but I trust him more than her! Understand? So now what? About what? What's next? There is no next step! It's all fucked up! I don't know what to do. Why is there no info about a guard using a civilian car in Permadi's plan? Fuck you! I should've never trusted you! I didn't know the cops would be there either! You asshole! Damn it! What about the others? I don't want Piko, of all people, to get caught. Why him? His mom died when he was a kid. And his father… He went to jail for robbery a few years ago. And here I thought I had it rough. Mine are nothing compared to his problems. -It's all my fault, Fella. -No, it's not. It's not all your fault. If the cops hadn't arrived… Who's that? Sarah. Don't you dare leave me again! Have I ever left you? I wasn't leaving you, Sarah! I was telling you to run! I wasn't expecting the cops! Hey. Tuktuk got caught. What do we do now? Oh, God. We're fugitives now. What about my grandma? Oh, grandma. I'm worried for my dad's safety. If you remain silent and do not cooperate, I can't guarantee that I can help you ease your sentence. Who were the other two that ran away from the truck? They caught a driver called Tuktuk. Your friend's car is now a crime scene. Do you know Yusuf Hamdan? Isn't he your friend? WANTED LIST His cover has likely been blown. You should be careful. -Okay. -Call me if you need anything. Thank you. Is the phone secured? Piko is safe. But they got Tuktuk. Gito said the cops might know who you are. Okay. Excuse me. The National Gallery is asking about the painting. The HQ wants to speed this up so they can hold the exhibition on time. It's a direct order from the palace. The strange thing is, we got these paintings from two similar trucks. Not only are they the same painting, but the two trucks were identical, even down to their engine series number. Not just anyone could pull off this robbery. They're capable enough to not only steal but also switch the paintings. More importantly, we can't tell which one is real and which is fake. The National Gallery suggests calling the palace's curator. Well, send them a letter. Let them check this tomorrow. Yes, sir. Sita, come on. I want this room highly secured.
