Our family hands down to us the ideas that keep us alive, as well as the illness that will cause our death. Marcel Proust: In the Shadow of Young Girls In Flower - In Search of Lost Time THIS IS NOT BERLIN Did you see those fuckers running away? There was a shitton of them! I told you those fuckers over at Highschool No. 6 were pussies. Don't you have any other tapes? It's my car and I pick the music, man. It's bad enough we have to drag you away every time you pass out during a fight. Dude, my highly intelligent brain knows those beatings make no sense. - And it disconnects on its own. - Come on, fucking Carlos. Listen to those fucking strings, they beat the shit out of your hippies. Holy shit! They got you good! - Those assholes got it worse. - Damn right! I actually didn't see anything. You two are a pair of sissies. Hurry, hurry! Suck on that, fuckers! Let's go! Go, go, man! Pussies! Asshole. - Got your asses kicked? - None of your business. Who did you fight? Who won? If you don't tell me, mom will hear about this. Then I'll have to kick the shit out of you. My He-Man! Open the door! It's a rainy afternoon in Mexico City. And now, international news... Ma... ...with Lupita Miranda. Thank you, Abraham. Yesterday morning, an enormous fire destroyed... Ma... ...the Caledonien Hotel in Kristiansand, Norway. This resulted in... It fucking hurts. I'm never going to one of those stupid fights again. Too bad, dude. We've got no choice. Kickass tune! This is one of the best songs in history, dude. Come on, how can that be one of the best songs in history? Listen to that guitar, it sounds like country. Fuck off! Wait for Alvin Lee's solo, dude. He's the best guitarist in the West. - Really? The West? - Really, dude. And this? It's Alvin Lee, dude. - That guy you said? - Damn right. It's awesome. This one also works? Of course, dude. No way. Did you make it for the electronics workshop? I could turn it in as my final assignment. - I'm flunking for sure, man. - Dude... I'm flunking all the math and science subjects. Dude! Fuck, that's my mom. Let's go to yours. - Carlos! - Bring the smokes. I can smell the smoke again. This one, man. Not these ones. - September? - No, I took it last week. These ones for sure. - And April... - February? Of course, February and March are the best. Damn right. New issue's here. These tits are amazing. Hold it, you idiot! We have to wait for him to open it. We don't want him to find out. - It was here, right? - Fucking Gera. She's the love of my life. - Sure, "the love of your life". - Asshole. Those are enough. Close it, close it. What are you up to? Hi. Knock before you enter. It's great that you're so interested in general knowledge. Encyclopedias are full of invaluable facts, little brother. I know, right? What the hell happened to you? Nothing, got hit with a ball. Yeah, right. If our old man finds out... ...he won’t let you go to Skaterama. We're not doing anything. You won't be allowed to skate ever again. What's up? What's up? We leaving? That's right, go away. You better be careful. All right guys, who wants some of this? Not you, fucking Urdapilleta. You have to return the last one first. - I'll bring it back tomorrow. - Then you'll get it tomorrow. - Fucking jerk. - You're returning it? Thanks. And it better not be all sticky like last time, come on. - You're taking this one? - Yes. All right, it's 2,500. It's due on Wednesday. Or I'll charge you another 2,500. 2,500 to rent? Yeah, you know that. What about pictures of your sister? Don't tell me you don’t jerk off all day thinking about her. - Just the magazines. - I'm not talking to you, asshole! Take this one, dude. Free of charge. - What a dick. - He's an idiot. - Are you taking these? - No? Then fuck off. Let's go. "A face pressed to mine. A black hole planting a kiss. An uproarious cry. It was not cruelty, not even insult... ...but a quirky form of universal love. An impulse of grave narcotic joy. I sought my kind and found none... ...how you rescued me, your peasant hands reaching through time..." Rita, but... ...what is that? We agreed on classical poets. It's Patti Smith's piece about Rimbaud. But you didn't get the hint. If I had brought something by Rimbaud you would have had no problem, right? But how dare I bring Patti Smith? What? Is it because she's a woman? Are we misogynistic in this workshop now? Is that it? Fine! So boring. No! No! Fucking hell! - Did you fuck up too, dude? - They're rigged, I swear... Fuck, dude. You're just not good at this one. Let's play this... No way! No way! No fucking way, man! You're breaking the record? Pull them up, fucker! Pull them up! Keep going! I'll get you back, asshole. Pull them up, fucker! That's the thing. When you're young you can't see what's in front of you. And that happens everytime. With a career in engineering, crises and devaluations don't matter. Engineers will always be needed. Martín is an engineer. - So what? - "So what?" - Well, yeah... - His father... ...could direct him towards that career. Well, it's not like Martín is around or anything. - Lucho, enough of that game. - Thank you, darling. Don't say things like that in front of Carolina. Can't you see the state she's in? Besides... ...with all the buildings ruined by the earthquake, it seems... ...like an opportunistic career choice, don't you think? Just like Martín. Martín is a mechanical engineer. Stop bothering him. Come or you'll get depressed. We don't want him to turn out to be like you. Is he gone? Shit, man. See this compression ring? This little piece of shit? I spent four hours taking apart the engine because of this thing. Without it, the bike won't start. No, no, what are you doing? There's no way, dude. - Not a chance, man. - Why? Because you're only seventeen and I'm still terrified of my sister. I'm sure you tried it at my age, or even sooner. I don't know. But in one year when you're old enough I'll get you your first joint. - All right? - Come on... What happened with that girl? That neighbor you like so much. Even if she knew I existed, she's my best friend's sister. What if she did? What would happen if she noticed you? I don't know. I'd shit myself. I know. Truth is, that fear never goes away. Love is very wacky. It can hurt like hell. Really, it burns and sometimes it feels like you're dying. But when you find it, when you have that moment of silence with someone... ...taking that leap is worth it. And you have to realize that you can't control anything. Go for it, man! - No. I don't know. - Scared or not, go for it. But she has a boyfriend. Fucking Carlos, you hadn't told me that. - Yeah, he's an older guy. - Either way... ...the universe puts everything in place, dude. Now help me clean these pistons. First with the tow and then with the brush. Mrs Arriaga called. - Mrs Arriaga? - From school. Gera, I think you should... be more careful... ...with that extracurricular business you do at school. What business? I told you that I’ll pay you if you wash my car. And you, dear, should also be more careful with your things. My things? Your collection.... ...of "books". It's Tito. Will it work? Fuck. - What happened to you, dude? - Fucking pigs. They think we're still in the seventies. - Awesome. - Fuck yeah. Didn't I tell you this guy is a genius? Awesome, man. I owe you some cold ones. Just beers? You said that if he fixed it you would take us to the Aztec. Really? What? I didn't think he would be able to fix it or I wouldn't have promised. All right. You did a great job. This is Gurrola's work. Awesome. Speak of the devil... I thought you wouldn't make it. I was about to call another band. Almost. If it weren't for this kid, we wouldn't have made it. Did you fix his synth? That's why I owe him a beer. Pit! Hey! Make it two, won't you? Take it easy. I don't want trouble with dad. One beer each, just one. Hello, princess. Hello, sweetie. - Did you bring them? - Of course. Sweetheart, it's the last time we get these kids in. Things aren't smooth with the local government and I don't want them to shut us down. I have it under control. You were a simple death. You were a death as many. A dense fabric of words rushes, of metal and sand... ...to cover its face like a shroud. That emerges from a human portray since death. Almost concrete face, almost flesh. That lives itself as an impossible death and no, it survives. You were a death as many whose name I happen to not know. You were a simple death. You were a death as many. Monopoly gods of mass media... ...we have come to buy whatever it is you're selling. We don't ask for too much in return. Don't despair, fierce ones. We have made a deal with the gods. This time we'll make it to the quarter-finals. - How are you doing, kids? - That was awesome! - Everything you say sounds cool. - I'm glad you got it. Pit! Did you give them all these? That was really cool. Is this a gay bar? This is an everything bar. Turn it down. Fuck, Lucho, turn that down! But this was the episode we were going to watch together. Give it to me. Where were you last night? We went to a party with Rita and her boyfriend. - Did you have too much to drink? - No. Just one beer. I think I never had just one beer when I was your age. Have you had breakfast? Then go up to the shed and bring me the grill grate. I told your uncle he could borrow it for his birthday. All right. His chance for a goal is right there. But he misses. Form a line, we're doing penalties. He's starving. Throw him some bread. Dude, the Aztec was really awesome. Right? Yeah, but the music was just alright. Too much keyboard and too little actual rock. Well yeah, but the chicks were super hot. - But that's a fag bar, isn't it? - Yeah, dude. Was it really cool? It's an everything bar, dammit. That's your cue, Rangel, go on... He'll miss the penalty because of you. And he misses, no way. All of you, get in line. Fucking Rangel. If you keep going to those places you'll end up like them, nerdy and faggy. Watch out for the ball! Do you think that smoking eucalyptus could relieve a sore throat? You're joking. What do you mean? Yeah, if plants have the same effects 290 when smoked or eaten. So if you smoke chamomile you won't get diarrhea. Or if you smoke garlic your defenses get better. - And keeps the mosquitoes away. - Damn right. Look, dude. We're going to the Aztec tonight, right? Again? Well, yeah. I don't know. We could try a new place. Why? Didn't you like the Aztec? Yeah, it's cool. But there must be some other places, right? Where drinks aren't as expensive. Is this about what the guys said about it being a faggy place? No. What are you doing here? We want to go in. You can't go in. You're just babies. Besides, “Assembly on Fire” has taken over a cellar downtown. Everyone's there now. This place is dead. You're the kid who fixed Tito's synth? Yes. And this is Rita's brother. What's the "Assembly on Fire"? One of the most pathetic plagiarisms in the Mexican clandestine scene. Want to go? I'll take you. - All right. - Sure, let's go. What's up, Ajo? Yadira went too far this time, didn't she? - Whose car is that? - Joserra's Dad. What've you got? Rohypnol, Oxy, Ritalin, prescriptions... Give me two Roachies. What are Roachies? Poor man's coke. You're not your parents! You're not doomed to repeat them! You're not your parents! You're not your parents! You're not your parents! We're going to end up in second or third place. If we get third we'll have to face the fucking French. If we draw with the fucking Belgians we might even get first place. Come on, dude! We're not going to draw with the Belgians. Their fucking goalie is like nine feet tall. But we've got Hugo! We've never had a striker like Hugo. That's true! We might make it with him. - Are we going to celebrate if we win? - Damn right, dude. You know what would be awesome? If we got to face Argentina. With Maradona! What the hell? Fuck, man! Run, dude! Fucking pussies! What? We want to know if you'd take us to the Aztec. No. No, dude. I mean, I want to go to London but... ...our existence is bound to the confines of Lomas Verdes. But... please. No. Get the fuck out. We need to rehearse. Children that were slow learners. Teenagers with a higher degree of general maladjustment with a precocious inclination to drug abuse. Did you send Claudia to the drugstore? I'm sending Danica, Claudia got banned from there. Sexual promiscuity, sexual promiscuity. Is that the same kid who fixed Tito's synth? Yes. Sexual promiscuity, sexual promiscuity. Sexual promiscuity, sexual promiscuity. Sexual promiscuity, sexual promiscuity. Sexual promiscuity, sexual promiscuity. Pit! Pit, can I have another? Pit! Pit! What are you having? Beer. - You should try this instead. - Thanks. - How much is it? - Nothing. I'm Nico. I'm Carlos. Are you a bartender too? No. I'm more of a spiritual guide. Try it. It's good. - What is it? - Negroni. Gin, vermouth and Campari. Like the Soviet said: “Better to die from vodka than from boredom.” Hello, Rita. He's my little brother. Back off. Such a pity. I'll leave you to strengthen those family ties. I don't want you to go anywhere near Ajo. I mean it. Thanks, Pit. - So, no girlfriend, then? - No. Not at the moment. You? Exclusivity is bullshit. Hey... what about her? Maud. - Is she a model? - She's my model. Are you a photographer? This is Phillipe. Of course he isn't French. He records everything in Super 8 for his never ending piece. “And continues to watch, trembling nervously... ...the manhunt, and the big lips of the shadowy vagina from which immense dark spermatozoids flow unceasingly like a river and then soar up into the lugubrious ether... ...hiding all nature with the vast span of their bat's wings... ...including the solitary legions of octopi... ...now gloomy at the sight of these dumb inexpressible fulgurations." "The wings of a mosquito... As his voice is benevolent. Has he forgiven me?" Did you paint these? This is my past. And this is my present. This is you two, right? What's this? What do you do with this? That's not mine. Fucking Phillipe changed his Leica for a Polaroid. Sniff this. Are you okay? Carlitos, are you okay? I'm awesome. The Museum of Modern Art? You're a fucking bureaucrat! I tried, Nico! You need to understand. But... I have no arguments. - Your proposal lacks strength. - Don't lecture me. They name the exhibition Confrontation 86 and they only invite people past their expiration date. Where's the confrontation? It's a fucking charade. Look, Nico... Do you want to be real artists? Stop copying the Europeans. This is not Berlin. Gabo, you better go. Dude, come on. We're all brothers here. Brothers? Our friends are dying. And all you do is party every night. - Every fucking night! - Just leave. Fucking phony fag. What's up, dude? Where were you? I was looking for you. Upstairs with Nico. Upstairs? What's upstairs? His study, dude. They gave me a popper. No way, man. A popper? Cool, dude! What does it feel like? I don't know, weird. Awesome. No way. Let's go ask for another one. No, dude. There was a fight and they kicked us all out. - Really? - Let's get another drink instead. All right, let's go. Carlos. What time did you come in? Carlos. Sorry, mom. I was studying at Gera's until very late. I thought there was no use calling since you wouldn't have heard it anyway. Your mom called me. Thanks, ma'am! Have a really nice day. She's really worried about you. But I'm more worried about her. How are you? Fine. I don't know. Have you ever felt like you want something but... ...there's something inside you that won't let you do it? Like a voice that doesn't shut up and it's not even yours. That fucking voice is a pain in the ass. Since I was a kid... ...I've felt out of place. You soak it... ...so it doesn't burn down too fast. Go ahead. Slowly so you can pace it. It's strong, it's Michoacan red hair. Told you it was strong. We waste too much time worrying about what everyone thinks. Enough, enough. And then it turns out that the voice has nothing to do with them. Or with you. You know what I'm saying? Have another drag. But a tiny one. You don't want to have a bad trip, kid. Don't start the engine, dude. Your dad! He's coming! - Just kidding... - Fucking asshole. Get in, idiot. Get in, get in. Holy shit, dude! Let's go. Fuck yeah! Holy shit, dude! Nico's not here. Then call Ajo. Seriously, he knows us. Ajo isn't here either. One of them has to be in there. Just go tell them... They're not here. I've already told you that you can't go in without an ID. Fuck it, man. 490 Let's get out of here. I thought we could now come whenever we wanted. Whatever, dude. Fucking shit, man! - Shit! - No way, no way. Shit! No fucking way. They fucking took the stereo. Fuck, dude. My dad is going to kill me. What the fuck were you thinking stealing the car, Gera? Come on! I told you, we invite them once and now they think they’re the shit. How could you leave a car with a Clarion stereo in the middle of the street? Let's see how you get out of this one. Did you want me to take a taxi? Don't you know you get robbed in taxis? You could've asked me to take you. Dad, no one likes getting to a party with their parents. Whose party was it? My friend Natalia. And what was your brother doing there? I went there with my friends, word got around at school. Look, I can help paying for the window and the stereo. No. It's not about you being a martyr. It's about you taking the car behind our backs and without asking. And, yes, you'll pay for the window and the stereo. You'll also be grounded for a month. Why me? Aren't you telling us that you took the car? And you're also grounded. - Are we clear? - Yeah... Hey... ...do you think Nico will let me borrow the phone to call Gera? - Gera? Rita's brother? - Yes. Sweetie, this is not a kindergarten. You can't bring him. Let's see... Much better. Sit there, little guy. Hey... ...what did they mean when they said that everyone is dying? - You mean what Gabriel said? - Yes. AIDS. So you're all gay? Or are you all bisexual? Let's say we're fun people who like living amongst fun people. And do fun things. IN ITS ESSENCE, THE PATH IS EMPTINESS IT'S NOT THE JOURNEY BUT THE IMAGE OF IT This is Alÿs' work. A Belgian who just got here. It's fucking awesome. Everything's art. The trash in your house, the debris in a construction site... ...my piss, everything, dude. But, bougainvilleas in a well? Really? - Don't be old-fashioned. - Dude, come on. Are we talking about Gabriel's bougainvilleas? No. It's not about everything being art. It's about understanding that those bougainvilleas changed place and that they won't be there tomorrow. Oh, come on! Give me a break! Today you had to give them your own meaning. And that's it. Come on, you're a phony. You just hate him because he's dating Pirrinos now that doesn’t count as discourse. Honestly, I don't see any real depth in that work, man. You have to be able to expand consciousness. Of the one who makes and the one who looks. There are other ways to do that. Painting's going extinct. It's almost impossible to start a real revolution with painting. I don't have any social responsibility and I don't see it losing credit. That's your problem, you can't see. You're 60 years behind art history, for God's sake! Art is political, wether you like it or not! I have news for you... ...as Mexicans, our duty is to politicize our discourse in any way. We paint. Revolution is in the content. We're Jungian, dude. Or German neo-expressionists living in Coyoacán. I'm just saying that the only art that matters is the one that's violent and disgusting. - Fuck your stupid museums. - Fuck your disgusting art. You? Weren't you grounded? I am. But you're not going to say you saw me, okay? Is Gera here? You tell me. Who did you come with? Oh, wow... We're getting settled, aren't we? Carlos! Hurry up, the bus is here! Or you'll have to get a ride to school, you idiot. - Don't worry, Lucho. You go. - Okay. Where's mom? Still asleep. In this case, the value of the cosine, since our hypotenuse is 1... ...is equal to the adjacent cathetus. Come in. If you're late again, you'll loose your right to an exam, Chávez. Pretty. That's enough. Pay attention. Stop it, boys. So, now let's do the sine of theta. Okay? We've got the opposite cathetus over the hypotenuse. Likewise, since the hypotenuse is 1, then... What are you laughing about? The sine of theta? Is that it? You've never heard about it? Let's see, then. The result is A... - What's up, dude? - What's up? - Why didn't you tell me? - About what? About yesterday, dude. Nico called me last minute to help him. Besides, aren't you grounded? Come on, dude. You know I would have sneaked out. You should have told me. What a jerk. You nag me more than my mom. So lame. So lame? I took you to the Aztec for the first time, asshole. So don't come here with that fucking attitude, come on. We don't have to do everything together. Fuck you. What's up, Lyn May? You went too far with that look, man. Go dance, dude. Exam is today, boys! Sit down, please! Like we said last week, you have exam today. Sit down. Take out your notebooks. Question number one... Take out your notebooks. Question number one... Question number one! Be quiet! Question number one, write it down. Get in, fuckers! Hurry up! You guys get in my car. Max, take those guys. Get in the Beetle. What's up? You should leave, man. Where are you going? There's another fight. I'll see you guys there! What are you doing here? Are you okay? What happened? Do you want to come to the show? We're playing in Ecatepec. It might get rough but it could be cool. It's a real gig. What if our parents find out? Don't worry about it. And if there's trouble, don't worry. Come on, let's go. Are you taking the synth? Gera's coming with us. All right, Manifesto, it's your turn. - Sorry, man. - Come on, come on. Get up there. It's still shaking a bit but we're taking it easy. Let's wait a second. We picked up the pieces on our own. We found what could have been a home. We picked up the pieces on our own. We found our loneliness in other's faces, on our own. There's nothing else, no place to fall asleep, only to fall. I couldn't see the crack nor the splinter. Not even the living suffocating among the stones. Yesterday's rain drains through the walls. It doesn't protect us anymore. Yesterday's rain. I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling. Where there's no city, we're all lost. Where there's no city, lost paradises. Where there's no city, we're all lost. Where there's no city, lost paradises. Takes some balls to come and play here. Yeah, I've never been to a place like this one. Of course not, dude, you're the pretty ones. The space that contained us, not the walls of confinement, not the windows… You're all pretty too. We are hood. Hood hood. No shame. I don't know what we are. I can attach the spring to the arrow, then. Of course, you can attach the spring. You're going to squeeze the spring, change the engine's polarity and, in theory, it will shoot off due to inertia. It's all classic mechanics. It's also a good idea to put a shaft in the middle, right? Yes, that's a good idea. That way the lower part of the doll drops down. You have to make sure that it's very lightweight. The things you choose to make the doll of have to be very light. You could use a starter car engine that could fit in the shoe. In fact, I'll give you Federico's number. He could get you some used engines. This is really cool. I love the project. Awesome. If you like engineering so much, why didn't you keep at it like my dad? I gave your dad his first job, believe it or not. - Really? - Yeah. - We both worked at Renault. - I didn't know that. And it was well-paid. Let's go, dude. But later I realized it wasn't my thing and I told them to fuck off. Let's go. Walk! You're disgusting! Move! Whores! You're disgusting! What happened? He was riding his motorcycle and the truck driver didn't see him. Thank you. We have to keep going. I'm sorry. Thank you. Your other friends didn't come? You should keep his stuff. No one here is going to clean up this mess. And I couldn't do it. That's lovely. Lightnin' Hopkins. Right? What? You think you were the first person to sit down and listen to blues with him? Don't underestimate a younger sister's need for attention. Is that weed? Is it Esteban's weed? Fuck, Carlos. Did that asshole give you weed? He isn't an asshole. Don't push me, I mean it. Give it to me. Give it to me. What's up, Easy Rider? Sorry, Charly. Come in. - Sit down. Want something to drink? - No, thanks. What happened? Can I stay here? I don't want to go back home. Of course. For as long as you want. Everything's going to be fine, Charly. Sorry, sorry. No, I can't. Don't you like me? No, it's not that. So? I don't feel well. I feel very sad. Forgive me, Charly. There's no rush, all right? I can wait for you to be ready. Mexico! Mexico! Mexico! We're here at the stadium... In only a few hours the Mexican team will take the field. People are waiting anxiously for their heroes to wish them the best of luck. Today, we're also expecting... We're ready. MEXICO IS 68 AND 86 - Soccer is killing us! - Wake up! Mexico is 68 and 86! - Soccer is killing us! - Wake up, wake up! THIS IS NOT A SPORT THIS IS NOT SEX The message is up there! Soccer is homophobia! Wake up! The message is up there! THIS IS NOT MASCULINE THIS IS NOT FEMININE Soccer is homophobia! The message is up there! THIS IS NOT 68 THIS IS NOT MEXICO Mexico is 68 and 86! THIS IS NOT BERLIN They are killing us and no one cares! He's going to jump! Now. He's going to jump! He's going to jump! He's going to jump! He's going to jump! He's going to jump! He's going to jump! He sacrificed for you. He sacrificed for you. He sacrificed for you. He sacrificed for you. You're very thirsty today, aren't you? Parched, actually. Pit, can I get another one? Did you like the performance? I liked seeing you there. Are you okay? Okay? I don't know. Everything seems... ...so ephemeral. A month ago... ...I was with that guy. And you were just a kid. I only gave them a hand. You do have things to say and know how to say them. Not like that asshole. I thought that it was about saying something. Then Tito told me that... ...my poetry was keeping him from getting popular. Maybe I also want to be popular. Popular? What matters is doing stuff and hanging around people that make you feel less lonely. Right? Charly, come here for a bit. May I? We're on every news channel. - Even fucking Zabludovsky mentioned us. - Really? And I just talked to this gringo that knows Jenny Holzer. And he wants us to make an intervention. - No way! - In New York, dude! We're going to live it up, you and me. What the hell are you doing, man? They're looking for you! Carlitos. Hey, this is a very special night. You and I are going to celebrate, come. Hello, Charly's friend. Charly's acquaintance. Okay, “Charly's acquaintance”. How can I be your acquaintance? You can start by giving me something that gets me going. I don't know, “Charly's acquaintance”. You're just a baby. And babies need to take it easy. I thought you wanted to get to know me better. Now this is real coke. - Pit. - What's up? What's with all the security? It seems they're guarding some Argentinian players. Get out! Is Maradona here? I don't know, but that other one who's on TV a lot is here. - Have you seen Charly? - No, not for a while. Pit! Pit! - Have you seen my brother? - No, not for a while. - Have you seen Gera? - No. I saw him. He's with Ajo. Where's Gera? Ajo! Ajo! Ajo, where's Gera? Gera, dude! Gera! Gera! Fucking hell! Gera! Nico! I think my friend overdosed! - Leave me alone, tell someone else. - Come on, dude! He was with Ajo! Look, kid, this is a bar for adults! Rita! Your brother is in the bathroom! He's my brother, he's my brother! He's my brother! Up to this moment, the amount of evidence is sufficient to prosecute the defendants for the charges of drug possession with intent to distribute. Therefore, the case will be set for preliminary hearing. Carlos Alberto Chávez Murga. Come in. Down the hallway, second desk. Name. Carlos Alberto Chávez Murga. This is an insult, doctor. Be serious. - Didn't Nico take the blame? - Rita, please. Mr. Westendarp's self-incrimination is completely invalid. They're going to prison. And if we don't come to an agreement... ...your case will have to be determined by the judge at the detention center. I'll go get some food. Do you want anything? Hi. Hi. Mom. Can you come with me? Hi. How are you? Better. You scared the crap out of me. Tell me about it, dude. I didn't die from the overdose, but my dad will beat me to death. Hey, thank you. I wouldn't have made it if it weren't for you. No. I acted like a dick. - You are... - I know. You too. My sister told me you banged Maud. You don't even like guys, do you? You just wanted to be there. I do, dude. I do like guys. You're my brother.
