Hulk 181? X-men 94? Dude, this is some collection you got, Ben. It's the biggest one I've ever bought. Yeah, you sold me most of them. Yeah, I guess you're right about that. So this is it, huh? Yeah. This puts me over the top. Thanks. Well, here you go, kiddo. Fuck! I could buy a nice car for that, Pop. It's called a savings account, Doug. Thanks, Dave. Hey, listen, just don't forget us when you're rich and famous, all right? BEN: Sure, Dave. DOUG: See you tonight, Pop. Ben, congratulations. You know how much damage you can do with that thing?

It's just my final project. For Harper's class? Yeah. Can I see it? Oh, it's good. Stop it. No, really. Your use of the light and the shading... It's beautiful. Really? (CAR HORN HONKS) SUSAN: Jennifer! Hold on. Got to go. Yeah, I can tell. You're going to be at Sheldon's party, though, right? Oh, yeah, of course. Good. I'll see you there. Dude, she is on your nuts like a squirrel. BEN: When is, um, Sheldon's party? DOUG: Tomorrow, why? Tomorrow night? My sister's birthday's tomorrow night. Oh, come on, Ben, help me out, man. You want cake and ice cream or 10 kegs with Jennifer Conrad in a miniskirt? Shit! You're going to Sheldon's, end of story. Doug, my family's been planning this a long time. My uncle shelled out much money, I got family flying in. What, you want me to skip it? Yeah, why not? What is this? It's for you, what do you think? For real? Yeah, it's just a little something to mark the occasion. You like it? Yes. I need this. Well, go ahead, open it. Rick's idea? Uh-huh. Where is he? Detention. Again. He'll be here. * Strum, strum my fuckin' guitar * This shit solves nothing * Strum, strum my fuckin' guitar * This shit solves nothing BEN: Thanks for the ride, guys. DOUG: No, yo, Ben. Wait up, man. I got to take a leak. Why didn't you go at the mall? I didn't have to go then. Can't you wait? Dude, I'm going to explode, man. RICK AND DOUG: What? All right. Come on, just hurry up. All right, fine. (CUTLERY RATTLING) What's going on? Sounds like a party. Don't you have something to do? So this is the Mercado house. RICK: Damn, dude, what's that smell? Look, I'll be back in one second. Making me hungry again. (GIRL LAUGHING) Hoy, the next doctor of the Mercado family. Where have you been, Ruben? Hi, Tito Lenny. Mom, can we turn on the fan? The house smells. (SNICKERS) Hey, bro, what are you doing? Check this out. Hi. Is that wicked or what? Dong, dong, dong. Hoy, you know what time it is? Hanging around with your friends again, wasting time. Get clean. Help your mother with the food. Yeah, whatever. Hi. Hi, there. And who is this? Some friends from school. They had to use the bathroom. Come on, guys, let's go. What are your names? I've never seen you before. Uh, this is Doug and this is Rick. Oh, hi. Hi. So you go to school with Ben? Yeah, we're really good friends. Then you should come by more often. We never get to see Ben's friends. Oh, Ben never invites us, that's why. Are you guys hungry? We have plenty to eat. Florie, get them some... Oh, no, Mom, they just ate. Guys, come on, let's go. GINA: Come on, boys. Get some food. You guys must get some really big portions here, dude. Hoy, Ruben, don't be rude. Yeah, bro, we have time for a bite. GINA: Give them something to take. Don't your parents feed you? Where do I get one of those naked barrel dudes? Try wal-mart. Bye. Dude, wait! No... (MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) JUN: Can we take a break now? ROSE: No. You got to put your hand up like this. Okay, four... Four counts and then turn, guys. Hey, Roland. Come on, join in. For old time's sake. (LAUGHS) * I shouldn't have to tell them * Why I'm not ROLAND: Ben. Ruben! Ruben, what are you doing? Don't you ever knock? What? Pop, do you mind? I'm trying to get some work done. You lazy child. I told you half an hour ago to go up there and help your mother with the food. I'll be there in a minute, Pop. You know everybody's working so hard for your sister's party, and you, you go gallivanting around... I wasn't gallivanting. I was working. God damn it, are you listening to me? Stop it with those stupid pictures of yours! (MUTTERING) Fuck this shit. What? Hey! BEN: Let go! God! You'll ruin... You're wrecking it. Let go! ROLAND: Give me that! What are you doing? Give me that. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Everybody can hear you, you know? Goddamn disrespectful child! Every time like this, Ben. (GINA SPEAKING TAGALOG) ROLAND: Ever since he was a little boy you've spoiled him. Enjoyed the show last night. Could you have chilled for just one night? Listen, Ben, I know that you think all this is stupid, but you could've avoided that whole thing with pop, if you'd just helped out a little. Why don't you just not go today? Maybe I won't. All I'm gonna see anyway is a bunch of punks giving me attitude and aunties with orange hair, bugging me to see if I got a girlfriend or not. I don't need that shit. You know, I can't wait for you to leave for U.C.L.A., 'cause I'm sick of dealing with your stupid shit. I'm going to CalArts. Yeah, and then you woke up. I'm serious. I went down there last Friday and I paid off my first year's tuition. You don't have that kind of money. I don't now. I dumped all my savings into it, and I even sold most of my comics. You did it? I am penniless, but I am enrolled. (GINA SPEAKING TAGALOG) It's going to be okay. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Relax. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Just kidding. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Gina. You only make it worse if you keep worrying. Yeah. You look good. (SIGHS) I look old. Come on, Ben. Come on. I'm going to take you out. No. Here I come, Ben. I'm going to take you out. Here I come. That's how you make a basket. Come on, you've got to come for the ball. You know who I am, right? I know who you are. Mom should have called me Hiroshima, Ben. You know why? 'Cause I'm the bomb. (ROSE GRUNTS) Yes! I am the champion. I am the... (LAUGHING) I'm going to take this ball away from you. Hoy, what are you two doing out here? You're going to be late. Sorry, Tita, we're almost done. Game! Thank you very much. No fair. I wasn't even paying attention. Tough shit. I do believe you owe me the car this weekend. So are you down for my party, or what? Yeah, all right. FLORIE: Come inside now. You're going to get too dark. * When I say, yeah * Lord have mercy, yeah * Whoa (INAUDIBLE) * Hey, party people, don't worry * 'cause a time will come for us, oh, yeah * People, are you ready? * To stand for real steady * People, are you ready? * 'cause we're talkin' about love, love, love * Love, love, love * For each and everyone * Yeah * For each and everyone * Only together Lenny, what are you doing? Go. * A peaceful solution's what we're talkin' about GINA: Thank you, Florie. * Come back together for future generations * So, people, let's overcome * The righteous way, a life where people stand up strong * (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHATTERING) Hi! Rosemarie, happy, happy birthday. You look so beautiful! Oh, thank you. Do you remember my husband, George? Hello. Happy birthday. Mabuhay. ROSE: Thanks. Who is this? Alice, you remember Ben, my youngest. Oh! You're so guapo, guapo, naman. You're so handsome. Do you have a girlfriend already? Uh, no. Well, aren't you going to give me a kiss? Mmm. (GIGGLES) Okay, you're going to dance with me later, okay? Promise? Oh, yeah. Anything. Talaga, huh. Ben, you remember my son, your old friend, Augusto? Oh, he brought his friends along. I hope you don't mind. GINA: It's okay, Alice. Say hello to your old playmate. Ma! Ma! Say hi, you rude boy. What's up? Gusto. Ha! These kids. So strange. "What's up." (SPEAKING TAGALOG) You know, Gina tells me he's impotent. Impotent? Ben, your grandfather. Kids, your Lolo Carlos. Hello, hello. My goodness. Look at you two kids. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) LENNY: Pa, this is Gina. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) LENNY: Pop, you might want to sit down. * Oh, yeah * Oh * Oh, yeah * Come on, come on * Come on, come on * Ooh * Yeah * Oh * I saw you walkin' down CONNIE: Ah, thank you. Hoy, Roland. Ben. I want to take your picture with Lolo Carlos. Come on, let's go. Okay. Closer. Now, smile. Come on, you guys look like statues. Smile. (CAMERA CLICKS) That's a good one. Give it to me, Mom. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) These kids today don't have the discipline to learn Tagalog. Look at Jun. All he does is gallivanting around with his friends and go disco-disco. Yeah, see, I told you. Mom's a player-hater. (ALL LAUGH) I hear it's a very good hospital. Oh, when Florie started at the hospital, there were hardly any, now almost half the hospital's nursing staff is Oriental. You really should say Asian. Oriental is a very touchy word today. The proper term to use is "Asian" when you're referring to people from the far east. I didn't know that. How interesting. Not so small, honey. Anyway, now we have Orientals, Filipinos, Mexicans, blacks... It's funny though, because Filipinos aren't actually considered a part of the Asian race, they're part of the Malay race. ALICE: You're so smart, honey. LOLO: So, Ruben, when did you decide to follow your Tito Lenny's footsteps and become a doctor? Yeah, when was this, Ben? I always knew Ben would get into medicine. I remember when he was little, he'd come home with injured birds and nurse them back to health. This scholarship to U.C.L.A. is a big accomplishment, Ben. Remember, Pa, I told you about it. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Very good. You're a hard worker, Ruben. You know, Papa, he has also a full-time job. Jun should learn to be more like him. (FILIPINO ACCENT) Sorry, I'm too busy going disco-disco. LOLO: What is this job? Oh, um, I work at a bookstore after school and weekends. Doesn't that interfere with your studies? No, it's cool. I mean, I got to make money somehow, right? (SMIRKS) CONNIE: Ben, didn't you want to go to some art program before? Oh, yeah. No, not anymore. We decided that wasn't a good route for him. By the way, Ben, I talked to this colleague of mine. He's willing to bring you on at the front desk of the pediatric ward over the summer. Another doctor will make the family very proud. Excuse me. GUSTO: So you trying to avoid me now? ANNABELLE: Gusto, look. Been blowing up your pager every day. What's up? You know what? Here. Take your pager and stop bothering me! So it's going to be like that now. Look, you're the one who fucked up! So don't you even turn this shit around on me! Come on, baby, take it. I don't want it. Take it. You know how much I paid for this thing. Gusto, come on now, I don't want that thing. Come on, baby, take it. I said I don't want it! Fuck you, then! God damn it, Gusto! Excuse me. My sister's looking for you. Oh! Yeah, right. She needs the schedule. Yeah. (PANTING) I got to go. Hey, what was that all about? You're just a bunch of dogs, all of you! Pleased to meet you also. I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean that. (SIGHS) Hi, I'm Annabelle. Yeah, I've seen you hanging out with Rose. I'm Ben. I know. Um, your sister's told me a lot about you. * Tell me Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. * For you Well, anyway, um, thanks for helping me out there. * About you I'd better go get that schedule to Rose. * You Um, uh, I'll see you later. * What's on your mind * I'm so confused about * This whole situation * This situation * Oh, what am I to do? * I'm so into you I'm not some trophy you can just go... Parading around in front of your whole family. What are you talking about? We're just proud of you, that's all. Be proud of someone else. (SIGHS) (SPEAKING TAGALOG) I'm not going to be a doctor. I don't believe this hardheaded child. Ruben, we've settled this already. We haven't settled anything. That cartoon school of yours is a waste of time and money. No. Med school is a waste of time and money. Now, don't answer back! I'm not going to spend $25,000 a year so you can just go on drawing those stupid pictures of yours. Who asked you to? You think you're so smart, huh? Spoiled, that's what you are. Spoiled? Me? Yes, you're spoiled! I've given you everything. You don't know what it's like not to have all these things. Yeah, so? So I do! I gave up my life making sure you don't go through what I did. And I'm not going to let you throw that away. Just what the hell do you think you're going to do in the real world with a degree in cartoons? Tell me. I'm going to get the hell away from you. That's what. Thank you so much for coming, Tito. I wasn't sure if you were going to be able to make it, but I'm glad you could come. And you guys got me a present, too? Thank you both. (WOMAN SPEAKING TAGALOG) (TITO SPEAKING TAGALOG) Will you excuse me for just one second? Thank you. I'll be right in front of the gym. No, I will not flake. Look, just pick me up, all right? Yeah, later. What are you doing? What's it look like? So you're just going to leave? Look, I got better things to do. That's your family in there, Ben. You actually think you're better than all of us, huh? Just 'cause you hang out with white boys and want to study art in college, you think you're the shit? Am I right? So what? Wake up, little brother. 'Cause you know what, you're just as brown as the rest of us. (MUSIC PLAYING) ...and see what's up, okay? See, I told you to just have the party at Chuck E. Cheese... WOMAN: So, you're going to... There you are, Papa, I've been looking all over for you. Um, 'cause, um, Tito Dante's not back yet. He's just on Filipino time. Bet you he'll say he lost his keys again. Are you okay? Yeah. Sure. Don't tell your mom. (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (SIGHS) These kids of today, they've got nicer cars than me. You know, Rose... I'm not like your Tito Lenny or most of the parents out there. Yeah? You got to go to work. Go to school. (SMIRKS) Can't even afford to buy you a decent car. Papa, you know that doesn't matter to me. Can't even afford a nice debut for you. I didn't even want a debutante ball. This party's more than enough. God! I wish your lola was alive. She'd be so proud to have a granddaughter as beautiful as you. Hey, uh, I'm sorry I'm late. I misplaced my keys. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Eh, let's do this! (ALL SCREAMING) Come on, are you cool? You ready? You go, pinay! Anna! ALL: Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Yay! (CHEERING) Um... Um... Hello and good evening. Uh, my name is Annabelle Manalo, and I'm a friend of Rose's. Um, coming up next, we have a special performance by the birthday girl and some of our friends. We've been working on this for a couple of months now, and I think that we came up with something really nice. So, please take a seat, because you definitely do not want to miss this. (SPEAKING TAGALOG) (CROWD APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Boo! The hell, dude! (LAUGHING) Hey, what's this? BEN: It's my sister's birthday-dance thing. Hey, looks like those, uh, Mexican dances my cousins do. Who's the belle in the purple? That's my sister. Really? (WHISTLES) She's pretty cute. Are we going? Wait up a bit. Let's check this out. (ALL APPLAUDING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Yeah! Whoo! (PERFORMERS CHEERING) How come you weren't out there, dude? That shit was cool. Oh, wait, let me guess. You had to work. (LAUGHING) Dude works more than a Jamaican and shit. GINA: Hoy, I didn't know you two were here. Hi, Mrs. Mercado. We just, we came to... to pick up, um... Uh, we came to eat. Oh, that's good. Now you'll have the chance to taste my cooking. Come. Come. You guys are so skinny. Don't your parents feed you? Well, you know, that's... (MUSIC PLAYING) DOUG: This is some good stuff. Yeah, this is some tasty feed, Ben. Especially this chocolate meat stuff. No wonder you got those big forks and spoons. Told you he's here. Yo, Ben. Why you chilling over here? Oh, I'm just observing how I don't want to be when I get older. Hey, congratulations on the dance. I really liked the way you did the, um... The... I mean, I didn't know you were in charge. Oh, that wasn't all me. I mean, your sister helped a lot, too. So... Jun. Oh, hey, this is my friend, Doug. This is Rick. This is Ed, Jun, and Annabelle. Hi! You know, we're all hanging outside until the real music gets back on. Why don't you guys come on out? Cool. Oh, I don't know. I think we got to go pretty soon. Go? But the party's just starting. I know, but we got another party to go to, right, guys? We still got time. Yeah. I know, but we don't, like, you know, know anybody. Come on, now. It's just us guys from the party. And Rose's crew from school. What are you talking about? Come on, Ben. Just hang out for a while. It'll be fun. (MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) EDWIN: Jo-Jo, Brian, Myla, Dave. Hey, Jackie! What's up, man? You know, smoking that shit's gonna kill you. Oh, fuck it, it's all good. Oh, my God! Jay, what's up? Is something wrong? Oh. No. It's nothing. (BOYS YELLING) (PAGER BEEPING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) So, at Alisha's party... Yeah. Gusto, show them what you got, man. Check this out, yo. Ah! I got it from that crazy nigga, Harvey. (FILIPINO ACCENT) Hey, what is it, a porty-pibe? A porty-pibe? Bitch, this a .9 M and M. You see this shit? Oh! Shit's tight, yo. Hey, Rommel, let me see. Let me see. What the fuck! I'm not done with this shit, you stupid F.O.B. Fucker, let go. Give me that shit! Bitches bust a cap in yourself. Bro! Who's got next? (GIRLS HOOTING) You guys, check it out! Looks like something's going on over there. Oh, my God! What is this? Your brother is hella getting his mack on. We used to be real tight. We used to hang out all the time. It all changed when high school started. Gusto wanted me to join a gang called barracuda or something. Barkada. It's Tagalog. It means, like, the people you hang out with. Like your friends. They didn't seem too friendly to me. You speak Tagalog? (FILIPINO ACCENT) "Oh, oh, pluently." That's wild. (SCOFFS) Anyway, um, he wanted me to join. And I don't know about you, but beating somebody up because they look at you funny isn't my thing. So he gave me this big guilt trip and then we ended up not talking anymore. And then his dad died and he and his mom moved away. Yeah, he never talks about his father. That's funny how you and Augusto are together. Actually, we're not really together anymore. I mean, your sister finally made me realize that he is just a two-timing player and he's just never going to change. Gusto? Yeah. A player. Uh-huh. That guy over there? Yeah. That guy over there. Get out of here! When we were kids, the only playing he used to do was with his Nintendo. I remember when we first met, he busted out with all the moves. I still remember the first thing he ever said to me, "uh, excuse me, "but, uh, do you know where I can find the nearest baker? "'Cause, uh, I want to find a cutie-pie just like you." Ugh. You think that's funny? My friend Rick, he likes to flirt by comparing hand sizes. Oh, really? Like how? "Wow! Your hands are really small." Wow! Really? Yeah, look. And you wait for the perfect moment, when you're looking into each other's eyes. And then... That was smooth. (LAUGHS) CAR GUY: Try not to touch anything. So, check it out, man. I installed a brand-new cam, bored-out throttle body, it's got 25 more horses right here. Shit's got crazy pull, baby. You squeezin'? You mean nitrous? Fuck, no, man, this is straight throttle. I hear you. Who did all this for you? My boys over at Flux Motoring hooked me up. Hey, man, how much did this cost, you know, with... With the bodywork and all? About $6,000. BOTH: $6,000! It's cool, though. 'cause the parents paid for all of it. Hey, you know how we do it. I can't believe you guys. You're just 2 more Filipinos selling out to the man. What? Oh, no. You're just another brown brother and sister playing into the hands of the car conspiracy. What the fuck are you talking about? Car conspiracy? You see, the conspiracy is a plan by the man to distract us from the problems of our brown brothers and sisters around the world. They're happy we people of color are wasting our time changing our mufflers and lowering our cars. They don't want us to learn about the war the Philippines had with the United States. Or how Mexican and Filipino-Americans fought side by side to unionize farm labor. Yes, it's true. You guys were just too busy adjusting your carburetors and intake valves. Oh, I know. What about back rubs? Oh, my God. That is so old. Yeah, but it's a classic. Here. I mean, you must be really tired from all that choreography. Okay. (GIGGLING) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Give me that. Uh! Yo, point game. Hit me on the wing, baby. Gusto, look at that shit. Bitch-ass punk got some balls. * Okay... Motherfucker. Boy wants a foot up in his ass. We should rush up his shit right now. Why? He's just talking to her. Nestor, that ain't no talk action. You need to claim that bitch back like a motherfucking caveman and shit. * I'll battle anybody They don't want you to know about the Filipino veterans who fought for America against the Japanese and never received any benefits. These same Japanese that slaughtered thousands of our people during World War II, and are now building these cars you're driving. Why do you want to make your car go faster, anyways? You think you're gonna compete in the Daytona 500? When have you ever seen a Filipino in the Daytona 500? Uh, never. Never. And you never will. You know why? 'Cause you're brown. That's deep. Wow! (SIGHS) * Yeah Uh! What! Game. Yeah! Show them what's up. Who got next? * Some nervous tendency If you weren't so pretty and all, we'd let you ball with us. Golly, Edwin, you're so thoughtful. Hey, yo, kuya, I can't get anyone. Damn. * Look in the mirror (MEN CHATTERING) Yo, Ben, we need a third. Ed. Come on! Be just like old times. Remember? Yo, can we get some real ballers up in here? Looks like someone doesn't want to get taken to court. Yo, you still got game, Ruben? Uh! (CROWD CHATTERING) Uh! Yeah! Uh! Yo, flagrant foul. What the hell was that? You got a problem with that, nigga? Yes, I do, Pinoy. It's cool. Let's go. Let's play ball. Preppy-ass motherfucker. Oh, yo, it's jungle ball. We'll take them out on the court. Ha! Wow!

Is that all you can say? Go, bitch. (CROWD CHEERING) Don't even think you could bust on me, white boy. (CROWD EXCLAIMS) Yeah, nigga, what? This is my world. Bow down, bitch. Yeah, you know who daddy is. Suck on these, bitch. (SCOFFING) Don't worry about it, guys. Come on. Let's go have a good time. Come on. Go back and dance. (ALL LAUGHING) JUN: Damn, we could've schooled those punks. I can't believe you lost that handle. Man, don't listen to him. Ben, it's a little-known fact that pound for pound, Filipinos are the best basketball players in the world. Yeah, we're all 5'6". So what? Look at Mugsy Bogues. He's Filipino. He just doesn't know it. That nose of his is straight up mountain province. Yeah, brother's from the motherland. Oh, man, that was tight. You guys played a great game. Aw, thanks, man. I think we got to get going. EDWIN: Ah, serious? RICK: Ah, yeah, we got to get to the other party. All right then. Check you guys later. It was nice meeting you. Same here. And happy birthday. Thanks. Um, I'll see you guys soon, okay? I'll see you inside, Ben. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute. * Cultivate your nation for a pure plantation Dude, man, are you all right? Relax, man. You'll forget the whole thing when we get to Sheldon's. You still want to go, right? DOUG: Bro, if you want, we can wait. It's up to you. * I'm on top of the world and started up from the beginning * Asiatic, and blazin' microphones' a habit * You know I get down and dirty * When it's time to set it Let's go get fucked up. (LAUGHS) Gusto, get your arm off me. Yo, it looks like that chump can't hang. Now what is wrong with you? Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time? Baby, come on, why are you tripping? I'm not your babe, okay? Just get the hell away from me. Stupid. (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING) After we get a couple of beers in you, you'll be all good. We've been waiting for this party all week.

But it wouldn't be "pair." What did you say? It wouldn't be "pair" to jump in. Pear? What the fuck does fruit have to do with this? I can't believe you're fucking related to me. You've been here two fucking years, and you still act like you went through customs yesterday. I swear, you tired-ass F.O.B.s come to this country and make the rest of us look stupid. Stop calling me a "pob." What are you going to do about it, you fresh-off-the-boat motherfucker? (GROANS) (YELLS) (GRUNTS) JUN: And did you see the look on Ben's face? Dude was about to go Cunanan. Man, I've never seen Ben go ape-shit like that before. What about his pops? Now that was some loco shit. Yeah. Yeah. Wild. Hey, guys. Ben. Badass himself. Fuck, man. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm cool. Are you sure? Can I get you anything? No, it's okay. So, what the fuck happened, man? I don't know. Everything happened so fast, I guess I just got pissed off. DOUG: Wow! Yeah, well, next time I see that G-thing, I'm gonna drop-kick his fucking ass. Yeah, right, Chuck Norris. Damn, if I knew he was carrying, I'd bone out Carl Lewis style. (ALL LAUGH) You're sure you're okay, man? Oh, yeah, just sore, that's all. RICK: Yeah, Ben's a tough motherfucker. DOUG: Yep! Hey, Ben, look who's here. Hey, guys, Anna's got to go. Yeah, I still got that curfew. Ah, later, Anna. Go get some sleep. Right, for a change. * So when you go to sleep at night * So I guess that's our cue to roll out of here, too. Uh, yeah. Um... Hey, bro, you gonna be all right? Definitely. Hey, Ben, we got to hang out with your cousin more often. This dude is deep. Yo, man, I'm always down to hang out with my brown brothers. BEN: Um, I'll catch you guys on Monday. Yeah, and don't forget, dude, you got to hook me up with one of those barrel men. Oh, yeah, man. Me, too. And I want one of those big giant forks and spoons, too. All right, bro? All right. Peace. Call me tomorrow, okay, girlfriend? Oh, yeah, definitely. See you inside, Ben. Yeah, uh, we're going to go clean up. (LAUGHS) You know, it's... It's a pretty dangerous area around here. May I walk you? Yeah, sure. So, you've had quite a night. Yeah, well, it was fun while it lasted, huh? Yeah, it was. But... I'm sorry it ended up like this. Like it's your fault? I mean, at least I learned how to cha-cha. (LAUGHS) I never got a chance to thank you for that drawing that you did. That was really sweet of you. It's no biggie. Damn, I'm still tripping on how you just clocked Gusto. I have never seen anybody do that before. I don't know, I mean, it felt good at the time. (GIGGLES) You know, come to think of it, I don't think Gusto's ever been to a party he didn't ruin. So... I feel like an idiot, I should have just walked away. No. See, that was classic Gusto for you. Always talking shit, looking for an excuse to act all hard. Well, actually, I was just thinking that maybe Augusto's right. Right about what? That I'm a sellout. A coconut. Yeah, right, like he should talk. Dude, when we first started going out, the boy used to braid his hair into cornrows, so... You think that's bad? That's pretty bad. You should've seen me when I was in junior high. Why? I used to sleep with a clothespin on my nose to see if I could make it more pointed. I mean, I don't know. I guess I wanted to look more like Jason Priestley or something. Come on now, you have a cute nose. See, flat noses are nice because they don't get all smashed up when you try to kiss somebody. You know what I think? I think you need a back rub right about now. I mean, come on, it's been a long day. Oh, really? Now, are you sure your hands are big enough? I think they'll do. Um, your sister has my phone number. Um, call me and, uh, let me know how you're doing? Sure. (ENGINE STARTING) * Seeing you * All this time * Has been such a lovely inspiration * Devotion * Faithfully I try * Can you see the things that I do? * Can you feel the things that I feel? * Do you know * how much I miss you when you go? * And if you promise to stay so true * I'll never, ever stop loving you * Oh, no (BIRDS CHIRPING) You gave Sinatra a run for his money last night. Tito Lenny was telling us about your singing days. Well, I was very young then. I wasn't planning on telling you this so soon, but I withdrew all my savings, paid off my first year's tuition at CalArts. I'm not taking that scholarship to U.C.L.A. Well, aren't you going to yell at me now, or something? All your savings. Yeah. It took that. Even with the loan I got from the school. So much money, Ruben. For a hobby. This is my portfolio. CalArts accepted me on this. I was just working on this. Well, I got to get ready for church. I'll talk to your mother about this... CalArts thing. Hoy, what are you doing? We'll be late.
