Are you coming for a walk? This is our last time in the pine forest. I sold yesterday. You are completely crazy. I'm very close to succeeding. You've been very close to succeeding, for 15 years. Expelled from all the academies... ...you squandered your fortune. All to make those awful noises that I hear in your lab. You're my only friend and you doubt me too. So tonight, we'll take the boat... ...and you'll see what I happened to discover. You'll see. We'll come back tomorrow morning. Set the frequency to 4000 on drive 5. This series-frequency interests me. Yes, but I find it hard to control the belly of the curves. Go on... go to bed. I'll come and tuck you in. Good night, Manfred. Tell me Dad, are you operating Manfred? Yes, but not tonight. Come on, off you go. Now it's time to sleep. Can you read me something? Not for long. Hang on. Where were we? Here we are! "When the abscissa thrust is equal to 2 and a half times "the square root of the vector considered... "the curve thus obtained is transformed "into a sine curve, whose amplitude is "in reverse relationship of the frequency given by?? The parameter. That's good. Hear that? Yes. Well then, you have to sleep now. Dad? Dad. Dad? Dad! Louise. Dad has disappeared. I know. My Dad too. They'll come back. [ 20 YEARS LATER ] [ THE LITTLE ONES ARE BIG ] So...? Almost 2 metres apart. Shit. There weren't too many oscillations? I didn't understand. There were not too many oscillations? No. Hey... did you change the mustard? Please, this isn't the time. Get out of the way, I'll try again. Say, Leo... Do you want me to help with the start? What did you say? For the start... Can I help you? Never mind... You'll see my new starter... Watch and admire. Careful, are you watching? Yes. So, Louise? Nothing... it's on fire. Oh, shit! Well... I don't understand. It's not new. No wonder... look where you placed the goniometer. I can't even turn it off anymore. Of course you don't care. You're not interested. Listen, I want to help you... but don't talk to me like that, because I'm not 12 anymore. I have other things to do. Your shitty research, more interesting, maybe? Oh, I'm sick of this. I'm really fed up. Really, it's insane. Foolish. You just don't realise the importance of my experiment. First radar flight test for a scale model. Indeed, it's of paramount importance. Did they restore your electricity? No, but I connected a cable to the construction site, behind us. Well, it can't continue like this. But it's been a year since I was evicted. I must hold on. I'm about to finish. I beg your pardon. Who is it then? It's just a bunch of old morons... ...who want to install a plaque in honour of your father. Alright... The Peripheral Science Foundation... old morons. Okay then... Maybe not old morons. They formalise the importance of this place. And don't touch my stuff. You're a dreamer. Anyway, I'm going, because I get up early. You can take this one by the way, it's ready. Already? How long did it take you? 10 minutes... one solder. Here... That includes 3 and a half hours... ...with the 3 repairs last week. 10 minutes! And I repeat... What is Man? The innumerable crowd? From which, from time to time, at random, a genius arises... ...a demigod, as was your father, Louise. The father, from whom you took over the torch and the secrets. His work on the physics of sound... ...his discoveries again and again misunderstood, even ignored... ...and which will shock the world one day... Well, they were born here. Here in this humble home that we wish to honour... ...with a commemorative plaque. Louisa. Louise, would pull the cord? No, you have to pull hard. Pardon. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Let me do it. PALANQUE REAL ESTATE HIGH-RISE DEVELOPMENT Was he your father? That's my father. The detached house... It's loneliness. Loneliness is death. I give back to man his next-door neighbours. This is my mission. One house for all. Soon near you, a new tower of happiness... "La Traviata". Your dedicated and friendly Arthur Palanques. What do you think, Monestier? Beautiful. Very true. Sensitive. I'll send it with the eviction notice. And the chocolates. Chocolates, of course. It's less inhuman. And it personalises. You always had delicacy, Arthur. Come in. Mouchin Pavilion, finished. About time. - It's true that it was about time. - Oh, it's fine, Monestier. Very good sir. You may go. Hey, the binoculars. The last eyesore is removed. What a pleasure to crush these pains in the arse! Oh yes. Those horrors give me a fucking headache. It's curious... me too. Monestier, I can no longer stand the sight of that mug of yours. Alas, Arthur, it must be. You have no choice. By the way, I got a phone call from Geneva. The tax-inspectors are there! You do it on purpose, right? Mr Monestier... I'd need of a clarification. The land you bought near the airport... The municipality didn't have an option? I'm coming. - So what do I do? - Work it out. You can go to jail. You too, Monestier. What are you doing here? The key's not under the flowerpot? I have to talk to you. Fine, come on. Let's go in, because... Here. No, leave it there for a few minutes, please. Let's say I was evicted... Could I come and live with you? Of course you could... what are you talking about? For 3 or 4 days, we'd always manage. Anyway, I'm dying of thirst. Coming for a drink? I can't keep you for dinner. Come on. Come on. - Are you crazy or what?! - I can explain. It's not possible. - It's temporary. - It's disgusting. How can I fix... Why is it locked? Calm down, damn it! I found what was wrong with the helicopter. What? The modulation of the sound signal. I took the transmitter apart. I think it?s all set. - Yes! - It's logic. - Come on. - Be careful. We'll try it. Gently. Don't touch... I prefer that you let go. Alright. Oh, shit! What? I invited a girl to dinner. You did well. You won't know I'm here. I won't be there. What was that? - My convection antenna. - Your what? This is my convection antenna. You have to fix it on the roof. Help me. No! I don't fix anything! I'm fed up. You can set the table if you like. Well, if you don't mind. You don't have much of a turning circle. It's carrying 3 kilos. Set the table instead of making comments. Stop nagging. - Hello, I'm Louise. - I'm Nadine. - Can I help? - No. Sit down. - Hi. - Hi. You moving? No. Louise is moving in. I thought you could only live on your own. It's not the same with Louise. She's like my sister. We were raised together. Anyway, she's only here for a few days. Good. We can eat! Haven't I told you about Louise, before? You don't have to excuse yourself to me, Leo. - No thanks. - Don't you want salad? No, it's the day for my alternate proteins. And the lamb? Not today, it would ruin everything. Oh that's right. Here, help yourself. Sorry about the noise, but you have to chew it well. What Louise is doing looks interesting. It's rather amazing to have a childhood friend... ...who turns out to be bright like you. Leo! What was that? What is it? Louise! Aren't you finished? Did I wake you up? A connection error on a controller. I can?t figure it out. Want to see who that is? No, you go... I'm scared. Look away! Hello, Leo. It's my last husband. How many were there? 2. No, 3. - Do you know what time it is? - Yes, but I have to see Louise. Charles... What is it? I'm leaving a party at the Boitelets... I go pass your house... and everything's destroyed. I thought she must be here. - So what? - Well, so... Well, nothing. It's obviously a new situation. I don't know... I thought maybe... you and me... we could have... I had the swimming pool in the living room changed. But Charles, we just got divorced. Yes, we just got divorced. SO? Everything is destroyed, everything is new. I was able to save my lab. It's essential for me. Charles, I'll never have time to take... Charles, Nadine. Excuse me. Yes, it is very urgent. Is Louise here? Vladimir, do you see the time? Vladimir, what's going on? - I have to see you. - Yes. I was on a sub-ionic type of emission. Yes. My asymmetric frequency decoder has gone haywire. - I'll have a look. - I want to see some tonight. - Goodnight, Louise. - Goodnight. No, Leo. No, really. I get up early tomorrow morning. I'll call a taxi. I can take you home. Do you mind? - No not at all. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Leo! Leo! Louise, tomorrow it'll be me who stays somewhere else. I found some chocolates in the mailbox. So, that's why you woke me up? Does it mean anything to you? I received it a year ago. A few days before my eviction notice. I give back to man his next-door neighbours. This is my mission. One house for all. Soon near you, a new tower of happiness. Your dedicated and friendly Arthur? Do you think he's going to fire me? You don't care. You said you'd move. But I haven't even finished settling down. My poor Louise will have to move. How much do you have left of your compensation? Not much. I'd just bought new controllers. Oh, of course. I'm skint too. We'll just have to borrow some money from Charles. At least he's rich. Leo, we mustn't leave this house. Hey! Vladimir didn't come about his decoder. I believe he was coming to get in touch with Dad. That's it... it's starting again. Louise... Your dad is not in a flying saucer. You don't believe anything. I'm fed up with your UFOs, your ultrasounds, your ultraviolets? Your father disappeared during a fishing trip. But he's not dead! And actually, I've something new. You got in touch with Martians up there? If that's how you'll be, I'm leaving. Well goodnight. There's coffee. You gave up on alternate cereals? No, but when I'm in a good mood, I have to eat meat. Oh, you... Come in! - This way! - Good morning. Leopold Artigues? It's me. Pathare's the name. Bailiff. I'm here from the Arthur Palanques Consortium for Town Renovation... ...to issue you with your eviction notice. Thanks a lot. What can we do? You can buy back the land. How much does it cost... square meters... all that? 6,000 per... times 1,200, say... how much is that? 720,000. - What do you think? - Goodness, we'll have to see. I'm delighted. It is so rare that we don't get screams of abuse. What would be the use? Well, I'll be on my way. Thank you, and goodbye. Goodbye, Sir. I really believe I attract them. Yes. Can I make you toast? That's it. Say... if I sold all my scale models... ...I could almost recover 20 million. Well then. Your scale models are expensive. And your devices... how much would you get? No commercial value. And Charles? No, I don't want to owe Charles anything. Thanks for your help. Don't panic! We'll work something out. Yes, and if you get your Martians on the phone... ...try to borrow some money from them. - All well with you, Sir? - It'll get even better. Arthur Palanques is one of the bank chiefs? - Do you want to see him? - No. I want to close my account. How much is left? - I'll tell you right away. - Thanks. Here, Mr Artigues... If you deposit 2,000 francs, you can withdraw 23 of them. Well, in that case, I'll come back because... Hello? Oh it's you. Good morning. Well no, I didn't call you... So many things have happened. Yes. It's amazing the way which I met him. I was walking down the street... I stop in front of the Chloe window and all of a sudden... ...I hear a voice behind me and it was him. For your happiness... ...invest in Palanques sweetness. Port-La-Boheme, an Arthur Palanques production... ...who has already given you Aida 2000... He invited me on a cruise on his boat. As you can imagine, I wasn't going to miss that. Tomorrow. 3 weeks. Yeah, I can lend it to you, If you want. I leave you the keys at the concierge? It's the decoder. Just how do you know that? - I hear it. - Impossible. Turn it on. On site, because the houses were threatened. It's the decoder. I didn't paid attention to what you told me, but it's obvious. Sorry. A baby carriage containing a significant explosive charge has sown panic in the premises of Shell France. How far will criminal imagination go to create engines of death? OK, I'm going to bed. I'm taking the bed. You got it yesterday. Note that the sofa is very comfortable. Always with the jokes! Louise! Louise... Could you make the box of chocolates talk to me? In what language? Mine. Sir? I'm not done at Madame Belon's. Whose? Belon. Like the dozen. - Are you going to catch red mullet? - Mackerel. Goodbye, Mr Tomani. Bon appetit, Mr Tomani. Bye, Tomani! - Hi. - It's for you. - It's only? - Thanks. Chocolates. You just activated me. I am a bomb. No, don't go, please. No no. Come on, sit down, sit down. As you have realised, this is a heist. Oh shit! You said it! And now you will follow my instructions exactly... ...otherwise I explode. You realise what you're doing? You look smart with your thingamajig. Come on, put it down immediately. Come on... Eat some of your sandwich. Yes, thanks. So... Eat properly, please. Show me. Above all, don't let go of me. To your right... There, yes, there are bags... Come on, grab a bag. So... No sudden gestures. Fill it with all those banknotes that are in front of you. Try to stay calm. Come on... Come on... No stupid hesitation. So... Come on... that's it... into the bag. Keep going, big boy. - The small bundle on the left. - I'm sorry! That's okay. So... smile. That's it! Now you and I will leave here in a normal way. We'll meet outside, in front of the bakery. - Understood? - With the bag? Yes, with the bag. Calm down, please. Smile. Alright. I'm in front of the bakery. Please, what do I have to do? So, ready? Walk forward... Go straight ahead... take the first left. Under the arches. Let's go. That was close. I'm scared. I'm very, very scared. It'll be OK. Stay calm. It's nearly over. Hi! Hi. - Are you going fishing? - No. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. - You call me tonight. - Alright. It's in my pocket. - No, it's not, right? - I assure you, Sir. Don't shake me like that... You'll blow me up! What a screwball! What did he want? A lighter. Okay, come on... all good. Go towards the edge. Do you see a small launch? The very small one, there? The tiny one, yes. Relax. Okay, put the box down carefully. So. Then the bag. So. Well done, thank you. Thief Thief! Thief! Ready, Loulou? I'm driving it to the intended location. - How much? - Do you want a receipt? Get ready! Don't snap at me! Good idea to redeem your plot. You know you have only 4 days, legally? How much do you have? - About 180,000. - 180,000 francs? Not bad, is it? It's not enough to stop the legal eviction process. - It's not enough? - Far from it. It's not enough. To the right. What do I do now? I didn't tell you... but I'm a father. Do not be afraid and do as I tell you. Thank you Sir. Stop. We don't move now. You'll see a truck coming. . You will drop the box in it and the bag. Understood? Then you will be free. Thank you sir. That's okay. He's in place. All good. - In that? - Do as I told you. And do it slowly. A bomb is fragile. What's happening? I lost it in the street... behind there. Stay here, I'll see. Is this yours? I'm sorry, but you know what kids are like. I know... I get pissed on. Er... I'm sorry... but was there no stuff with it? Because since my wife left? They all end up leaving. Oh, that's it. Thanks very much. There wasn't a small canvas bag? 50-50? That much? Yes. I split it... there's a bit more for you than for me. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Oh, Emile, where are you going? I'm getting some fresh air. - When will you be back? - At Easter! 720,000 francs... counted. So that's it? We own it? You've certainly been lucky. Here's your receipt. In a month, final signature. In a month? A month. Why did you have to accept their money? It's the law, Mr Palanques. You know very well that I don't care about the law. Take mine. This is the third pair this week, Arthur. You get nervous. After all, this shed won't bother you. You can build around it. Around it?! You'll see that horror from my balconies. We'll have this piece of shit at the heart of my beautiful ensemble. Aesthetics, understand? I may have no scruples, but I have rigour. I consider this sale void! You'll find these rats... We have squads for that. They're costing us dearly. They're as good as gone, Mr Palanques. - Who's that? - Oh, come on. The sewer guy. Who? The sewer guy. Monestier, I have to lie down. Monestier... I'm here, Arthur... I'm listening to you. Please don't forget that I'm not a doctor. The important thing is that I empty myself. I'm not a trash can, Arthur. Well, I know that gives you relief. Monestier, I can no longer hide anything. I'm suffocating. The bank teller, he's happy, in prison. That's what he wanted. Escaped. Those talking chocolates, that he accuses. Those little things that pursue us. These little boats... those little trucks those little bikes It has to come to a head. The driving force must come out. Pigs will fly before I have peace. The swallow whose eyes I gouged out, as a kid... It was the crazy crow who flew into my windshield the other day. It was aiming for my eyes. I'm scared, Arthur. That's all for tonight, Monestier. - I've nothing to say. - But what if... Last night, I dreamed. The guy came back again. The one who checked the accounts... And who fell off the scaffolding. Enough! Don't always mix everything up. Pour me a scotch. Leo, come quickly! - Do you realise the mess? - Come quickly! Vladimir was right. Listen. Louise Mouchin and Leo Artigues. Not worried. Shit! Shit, I lost it. I lost it. Ah, here we go! Soon? to come back? from? Louise. There is someone. It works on Manfred. Are you convinced now? Yes, but? I don't understand anything. I will try to be clear. Yes. I took over Dad's work on the composition of sounds... ...and their communication by certain waves. But I'm only at the beginning. And Vladimir, the other night, came in order... ...to capture what you just heard. But? ...there are billions of possible combinations... ...and I know now that I'll never get there. I am not up to it. Yes, you'll get there. Lets go. You mustn't be discouraged, I'm sure you'll get there. Try again. Really, do you believe it? Yes. - You're not making fun of me? - No no. So you believe in it too? Yes, of course I do. I've never been so happy you see, because... ...now I'm no longer alone. We're two people that know. Yes. But what's that? That's a possible application. It's Manfred. It has a nervous system that responds to sound. But I never really knew how to make it work. - You mean it works? - Yes of course. You see... that's how it is that it's seeing us. It's amazing. Listen. But that? But that's not all. It can walk and do a lot of things. You mean it's remote-controlled? No, it's more of a sound code. Here, you'll see. Manfred, say hello to Leo. Bla, bla. Yes, well, it's fine, Louise. Leo, say hello to Manfred. It doesn't always do what you want. Sounds make up its nervous system. I never have time to take care of it. Damn! Give it to me. Manfred, let's go ahead. Bla, bla. To the right. To the right. Good. Come towards me. Come. Come on... That's the way! Over there. That's good. Stop. Manfred... We'll dance, okay? 1, 2, 3. Gently. What if we shoot it? Are you sure you can control it? Watch me. Stop! Stop. Approach the table, Manfred. Stop. The table... there. The table, there! There, Manfred. Yes, that's good. Stop. Drink, Manfred. So? There. Again. That's enough, drunkard. Cheers. You just need to use the 78 brain-controls I know. With inverters and rotation relays, it's times a thousand. Dad was 20 years ahead. Okay, give me the gun... I'll try. Be careful, it's loaded. Manfred... Not moving. What can we aim for? - What's it doing? - Not moving. What's it doing? - Take it away from it. - How do I? Manfred! No! - Move! - No! Manfred! No! - Come on, don't stay here. - I'm scared. Don't be afraid! - How many did it fire? - 5? So there's one left. Don't move! I don't think the magazine was full. - Do you think or are you sure? - I'm sure. - Okay, so that's it? - That finishes it. It almost finished us. Because it was 20 years ahead when your father built it... ...but now it looks like it's fallen behind. It's my fault. I should've checked magazine. Anyway, we can?t hide the fact... ...that Manfred isn't quite on the ball. Go on, take the gun. If I had the means, a computer is what I need. This DIY job is pretty useless. That's all we needed now! What did you do? Sorry, I don't understand. I hope they have candles over there. Mr Palanques, we just cut off their electricity. It's just a start. I think we're going to crush them. Thank you? Mr Palanques. Come on, there's still work to be done. Oh shit! Oh my God. Oh, the filth. Look what they did. You think it's funny? They dye me, and it makes you laugh? I've got the message... It's signed Palanques. What's this? What's it mean? I don't understand anything anymore. Oh, the buggers...! The bastards! Get the hell out of here! Come on, trump. Diamonds are trumps. Did you keep a chicken for lunch? It's mine. Chicken shit... I swear to you...! Flea bags... I'm itchy all over. I'm itchy, too. That's it now. I'm fed up. They cut off the water. Give me a squirt... I can't stand it anymore. Your sanitation squads are a bunch of incompetents. Give them some time, Arthur. 2 months, Monestier... It's taking far too long. They've taken root. But I can't bomb them. That's too bad. Your investigation of those two freaks was very thorough. Thank you, Arthur. That Louise Mouchin is quite crazy. We need to find a tailor-made idea, Monestier. I'm quite sure that I have one one. It's a good idea. Come on, quickly! I'll go into the head office... ...of this Marginal Science Foundation. There's no head office... just a mail-box. - No head office? - No. So no building? Come on, Monestier. We're going to give her a building. We'll hold her. I must meet this Louise Mouchin. - Bring her to me. - Easy to say. Just do it. Excuse me for taking a little bit too long... ...but the project seems coherent to me. The idea came to you just like that, for the Louis Mouchin Foundation? I've long admired your father's work. It has been misunderstood. It hasn't stopped you from destroying us. I was absolutely unaware. That idiot Monestier didn't tell me anything. - True? - It's true. Come on, Louise. Stop thinking about the past. Let's drink to the foundation Louis Mouchin! Arthur didn't know that Louis Mouchin had an heiress! Isn't it beautiful? Mr Palanques, may I use your phone? Please, it's over there. Vladimir explained the problem to me of the convection antenna. It's essential. Don't hesitate to spend the necessary money. Our services will take care of it. According to your instructions, of course. To the marginal sciences. Hello? You'd have no rights regarding our lab? That goes without saying. It's a shame to have destroyed my father's place. We could have made it a museum. Well, actually, the Tosca program didn't allow for it... but with the Traviata project, it's all different. It's possible and with your agreement, that we can start tomorrow. - Unexpected. - Where will it be? Exactly in the place that you occupy. - My shed? - Our shed. That's out of the question. One moment. We have to let all this sink in. So the electricity has returned? Yes, electricity, water, the gas, everything came back. Well you see that he's a man who shows goodwill. We'll see. Arthur Palanques is no saint... But he's giving me the chance of a lifetime. Hush... Listen. Monestier, we need to talk. - What now? - This crow. This black shape in the sky that pursues me. That dream again. No, Monestier, it's not a dream. You put a microphone at? Oh no, you're despicable. You disgust me. Stop. Stop that! You won't overturn the Louis Mouchin Foundation. Your conduct is worse than Arthur's. You're a selfish monster. This is the chance of my life... ...and you want to destroy it. At least say something! You're too dumb. What? I'm sick of your toys! I buy a hotel on Rue de la Paix, one on the Champs-Elys?es... ...and I put 3 houses on green areas. What do you say to that, Monestier? Perfect, Sir, but it wasn't it my turn? Rubbish. I threw a double, I play again. Well, I'm playing again once again. So. I draw a lucky card. Read it, Monestier, I don't have my glasses. "Go to jail." "Go directly to jail." "Do not pass Go." ?Do not receive 200,000 francs.? Monestier, I believe that you were right. It was your turn. Mr Saada is here. Send him in. - Am I disturbing you? - Not at all. Sit down. I have a nice surprise for you. I checked. Artigues and Mouchin paid with stolen banknotes. I was able to trace the numbered bundles... ...to the hold-ups from each of your banks. So they were involved in those incidents? You sure? 100 percent. My old friend, I'm going to ask you... ...a great service, a very great service. Find the secret to it all. My pleasure... I want to do it. You can count on me. Now I have them. - What are you doing? - Calling the police. I just gave 100 grand to Saada to wrap it up... Do you want to open it? - I don't understand. - As usual. You want my projects frozen for years and years? La Traviata paralyzed again? Well of course... The police looking at your business... At OUR business. Palanques has managed to screw things up between us. He has nothing to do with it. - Where will you go? - None of your business. But Louise, Palanques wishes you no good. - He's all hot air. - Really? Might I know why you say that? Here. Hello Palanques. You know... No, you don't know, I'll tell you. At each bank cash desk, there's a bundle... ...of numbered banknotes that we slip into the loot... ...that gangsters like you are happy to take away. Like me? Mr Artigues, you're in no position to interrupt me. I have proof, here it is. You bought this rabbit-hutch with my lovely money. So you choose, that's to say you have no choice... Prison or the street. Why don't you call the police? Let's just say that you and I have had a relationship... ...that still leaves me with a whiff of friendship. I give you a week... ...not an hour more. What about my foundation? Your foundation?! You've nothing to say? No, I've nothing to say. Say something. What? I don't know? That you were right. That I'm a bitch. I'd never say that. You realise this is the second bottle. The white wine? It didn't touch the sides. Anyway, we have a week. We've time to find a solution. You're ever the optimist. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - All well? - Good evening. - Good evening. - All well? - Good evening. Good evening. - Good evening. - Thanks. Nadine's pretty. And friendly. Very. It's kind of my fault... I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. - Really? What's important to you right now? Don't know. - You. - Me? Yes, you. I even thought for a long time that I should marry you. No, I mean... when we were little. Well? ...you're not going to tell me that it's never entered your mind. It has... and where would we be now? We wouldn't be sitting here. You'd have become like all the other husbands. You'd have explained to me what was good and bad for me. I don't want anyone deciding for me. - You understand? - Good evening, Louise. - Good evening, Jean-Marie. - Good evening. - Jean-Marie, Leopold Artigues. - Hi. I didn't see you. I'm with friends, we're going to the Camargue, dancing. Coming? We'll talk about the past. Maybe later. Yes, because now she smells of garlic. 'Bye. - You're tough. - Who was he? A friend of Charles. Owns ships. How disarming! Don't waste your time. You've important things to do, right? Won't you give me another glass of wine? I really need it. If this is the solution, let her rip! The crow! The crow. A crow with propellers! When I was a little boy, I was wicked... ...but I didn't realise it. I was hurting, but it wasn't on purpose. I was doing wicked things like that, badly. But it just happened... it was never on purpose. I hope you thought about a corkscrew. Don't worry. Good then... general electrical circuit. Stabilization gyroscope. - Normal function. - And control of the arm? - No anomalies. - Okay, everything's fine. Wait a second... I'll do a voice-test. No, don't mess around. You're going to make him do stupid things, aren't you? Manfred, we're going to Arthur's. Is that you, Doctor? I was expecting you. No it's me. Hands up. My revolver is loaded. So do what I say... - ... and no one will die. - Thanks. - We'll drink to my health. - My pleasure. You don't seem to understand. I do! Do I shoot your ear to prove my effectiveness? I believe you! - No! - Look anyway. No! Retrieve the bullet, that you'll put in a hole provided for the purpose... ...top right of my body. Come on. - Here? - Yes, perfect. Thanks. I don't like leaving evidence. Now take the bottle of whiskey. Drink. The doctors told me I shouldn't. Drink! Drink. Nothing to fear... that's good, drink again. I'm choking... Again. Task completed! Now, stand up. Careful... Easy... Go over there. - Yes, over there. - Oh yes, okay, okay. Now get undressed. That's a good idea... a good idea. Don't worry, I don't have sex. So that's not the reason! It's important, but that's not life. The important thing... ...is this. Here we go. It's not at all hard to do. That's enough. Now get out. - That way? - Yes, that way. You speak... and I executed right away. When I say, "I executed", I don't mean... - Move it! - Yes, yes! - I thought... - Get out! Yes, OK. I thought we were friends. Don't make small jumps like that to scare me. Well I can do that too... Wait, seriously... There's the stairs. I don't know if he can. Go ahead, put on the gyroscope. I feel so good that... Halt! You vill shout after me: "Long liff anarchy!" Long live anarchy! - Was I good? - Alright. - Come on. - I can do better. Much stronger. Go for it. - CIA is SS! - CIA is SS! CIA SS! Bunch of idiots! Weirdos. Crazy! Faggots, bunch of morons! I'll give you damned houses... hutches for those dogs... ...for these sons of swine, sluts. All bitches! - Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening. So, Arthur? I can't take it anymore. He needs rest. You'll take this, sleep 24 hours. Impossible, tomorrow I'm dealing with my biggest market. Arthur, I'll take care of it. You, Monestier...? You're incapable of it. Is it so important? It's the deal of the century. The future of my companies depends on it. I'll be on my feet. So you take 8 instead of one. It'll have the opposite effect. It's good for everything. And like that... ...the crow will remain lying down. Goodnight, Arthur. Goodnight. Tell me, does he often have these turns? Yes. More and more. Well, all the best. Your Highness, I'm delighted to meet you. I'm just a counsellor. Sorry, I didn't know. Nobody knows that Emir Abdullah has retired. And he left his kingdom to his son Abu Salama. I'm very honoured by the mark of confidence... ...accorded me by Your Highness. I am also very honoured. My associate. If Your Highness would follow me, refreshments await. His Highness wonders if you don't take him for an emir. I don't understand. Clearly, His Highness wonders... ...if you aren't having him on. How would I dare? Not at all! Mr Palanques... the times have changed. We can no longer be persuaded... ...to be plucked clean as a whistle. This tower is not worth a red cent. It's worth 12 billion. - 10. - 10? Never mind. The tower is an insult to harmony and common sense. Good day, Mr Palanques. This technological marvel is your bodyguard? Not really. - Who is he? - He's an emir. Stay where you are. State your identities. No, don't move, please. Mr Palanques... I'm very impressed, very interested. It's astonishing. Could you get me one of them? - I am unique, Highness. - I offer it to you. Okay, we have to bring Manfred back. Right away. Don't move, or I shoot. It's gone berserk. Monestier, help me. Stand back. Watch out, I'm armed. You don't stand a chance. I'll shoot. You won't get me. Monestier! You saw it? You saw it, didn't you? There it is, Arthur. - Exactly. - What did he say? Why should it matter to you? Over there! Come on! That's the explanation. You made a mistake there, Sir. He's passionate about cybernetics. You should find that robot. You heard, Monestier. All the same... he really liked Manfred. So what? A potential backer. Louise, please... Stop dreaming. I'm going for a swim, because really... All the same... he's really handsome. Oh, your emir, your emir. Just sell him Manfred. You'd consider it? I'm sure he'd buy it for a fortune, from you. Are you seriously considering it? Obviously. Why not? You're sordid. I'm sordid? - You sure are. - So I'm sordid? - Totally. - Ah, I'm sordid... You're crazy! Oh, Leo! Leo, stop it, no! I'm sordid. Bye! Where he's going? Are you leaving me here? You louse! Leo! Leo! Yeah, it's him. It's him. Do you recognise the facts? What facts? I don't know what you're talking about. But... you know him. Never seen him before. Well, we'll see about that at the police station. Will you let me change? Leo? Leo? The sewerage worker has been arrested. Disappear for a while. I don't want you arrested. I see only one solution... Retrieve that robot, whatever it takes. And I make a point of patching up business with the emir. Monestier... I risk going under. Arthur? But if I go under? Come on, come on! Arthur, well... You go under with me. You'll be late. - Hello, Saada? - Is that you, Monestier? No names, you fool. - What is happening? - It's very serious. As soon as I hang up, pack your bags. Carry as much as possible. You see what I mean. Jump on the first plane, if you still have time. Is it at that point? Everything exploded? There's a flight at noon. See you, Saada. Perhaps soon. You know where. - That will work? - Trust me. You're risking a lot with this. To drown Palanques, I can get wet. It's up to you. The emir told you why he cares so much about this robot? The emir lives in a very rich country where there are few people. So, few workers. So you see the usefulness of robots. He's a man ahead of his time. The rats are leaving the ship. Departure for Zurich... ...Air France flight 686, boarding immediately. Leopold Artigues. - That's me. - I know. Come on. And you too. Oh, we can start. Who is the groom, who is the witness? Listen to me, I've thought about it. I can't do without you. I love only you. I've decided to marry you. - Oh, she's beautiful. - We're going to have the wedding. Wait, wait, wait. Louise, excuse me, what's happening? Leopold Artigues, do you want to marry... Louise Mouchin, here present? I'm marrying you, but answer! Very beautiful. Make up your mind. If he won't have her, I will. Leo, we're waiting for you. - Yes, OK. - Yes! Louise Mouchin, would you like to take as husband... ...Leopold Artigues here? Yes. I declare you united by the bonds of marriage. - Well then? - Wait... You have half an hour to yourselves. Half an hour? Leo, I'm sorry, but I have to go. But? Your collaboration has been invaluable. It will be taken into account. What's in there is damning. Stolen banknotes. But how did the money get in there? He wanted to get rid of Artigues by any way possible. An obsession. Moreover, lately, he hasn't been thinking straight. I didn't know how to stop him. I understand. Leopold Artigues... You're free to go. This all we have to offer you. I'm told you'll be transferred to a convalescent home... Listening to the trees, the birds. Thank you my friend. This'll be fine. May I? That way... no crows. Do you have any accountancy skills? Yes, I do. That's the very reason that I'm here. Now you're my right arm. 20,000 francs a month. I feel I'll be in the service of a big boss. Take a note... The Palanques organisation... ...is above all suspicion... ...and I can prove it. Mr Palanques, we're here with the telex. Put it there, thank you. The telephone line won't be in till tomorrow. That will be fine. And I can prove it. I propose a draw. Well... I hope I'll have better luck this time. I'm progressing. Excuse me. How is it going? Still lacking a little power. The VS6000 is arriving from the U.S. today. I'm very grateful. We must encourage research. What if we were to see where our robot is? Let's go see Manfred. Look how lovely it is. It's superb. So...? Manfred! - It learns faster than me. - I was thinking the same thing. I would need 60 new circuits. I've decided to learn baking. All right, I'll program you some recipes. Good idea. I'd prefer it to be Leo... he's a better cook. I guess so. I have to go back to the laboratory. Your wife is quite a personality. She's a remarkable woman. Outstanding? Speaking of women... I only see men here. Just men. So where are the women? In a safe place. Does that mean that mine is the only one walking around? That's right. You see... if your dear Louise had remained single... ...she couldn't have come here. Our laws forbid it. So? Maybe that's why she married me. Who can tell? So, Leo... another game? Not for the moment, Your Highness. Not for the moment. I have a small matter to clarify. Salaam Alaikum. Who else could have offered me such a setup? Not me, of course. But I believed that you could have ended up loving me. That?s all you think about. All the same, Louise... ...we're still husband and wife. We share the same mat. And afterwards? I love you. Obviously. Why "obviously"? You're the romantic type. Manfred! Manfred! Its radar must be mess up again. Manfred! Dad... Look how big these little ones are. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
