Kevin, I've told you I'm not having sex with you while I'm on my period. Because that makes me feel like a slut. That's why. No. Kevin, no. No, I don't care what your ex-girlfriend used to do. I'm not like that. I don't care what your ex-girlfriend used to do. No, just no. What? No, I'm not letting you stick your thing up my butt. That's... Ew, no. No, I just... That's it. That's final. I'm not doing it. I can't even believe you're asking me this now. I'm not having sex with you... - Morning, Senator. - Good morning. He's waiting for you. Have a seat. We've got some great news. Looks like Bird's not going to run. Word has it he's going to hold a press conference later this afternoon. Seems the press has been probing into his medical history. What a stroke of good luck- - We have problems too. All right. It's Erin. She ran away last night. Are you sure about this? She left this note. Does anyone else know? We haven't gone to the police yet. We thought it'd be best if we came and spoke to you first about it. Sean, I don't have to tell you that as soon as your opponents get wind of this, they're going to exploit it to the hilt. Your chances of winning the Republican nomination will be a virtual zero. People are going to be saying, "If he can't run his own home, how could he possibly run the country?" My advice to you as your friend and future campaign manager is to keep this as hush-hush as possible. Is this gonna affect her safety at all? What? Keeping it quiet. We're going to have to act quickly. I know some people. I'll make some calls. We'll get her back home. Don't worry. We'll have her back, dear. Hello? What took your ass so motherfucking long? I've been waiting here all night for your call. I'm leaving, Sugar. Baby, listen to me. Listen. I'm tired, it's late. Just come home, okay? I just wanna go home, Sugar. I can't do this no more. I'm just tired. What are you talking about, Naomi? Sugar, I have been thinking long and hard about this shit and I just don't wanna do it no more. I don't wanna work the track no more. Okay? I'm tired. Don't pull this shit on me, Naomi. Don't do this shit, baby. I wanna see my mama and my sister. I know, I know. I understand all that, but I need you too, baby. Plus that white girl you got at the apartment. You know it ain't right, Sugar. The girl can't even see. All right. You know, you done lost your motherfucking mind, Naomi, doing this shit over the fucking phone. It's time. I gotta go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hello? Hello? Oh, what the fuck! Everything's all right, baby? Everything's fine, baby. So what do you do now? That's a good question. It's a really good question, actually. Yeah, that was probably the hardest thing. But you know, when you gotta do what you gotta do. I don't know. They say, "No pain, no gain." I'm tired. I miss my mama. My mama gon' be happy, but you know, that man was my heart.

He take care of me. I take care of him, you know? And it's like a lot of people think like, a pimp is just somebody that comes to slap me around and take my money and stuff like that. It ain't even like that. It's like, when, what he does for me is something that I had nothing before I met him. My baby daddy was in jail. I had to pay my bills and he offered me like a whole new life. Ever since I've been with him, all my bills is paid. My lights is on, my phone is on. My kids is fed. I don't have to worry about nothing. So to me, he's like my husband. That's like my man. So I have the most respect for him, much love. It's nothing like what everybody think. And I'm just like, you know, I wanna set the record straight that we're taken care of. We ain't out here, all of us ain't out here, like doing drugs. We out here, we're business women. I'm an entrepreneur. I don't call myself a hoe. I'm handling business. I'm getting money, you know, and I'm taking care of mine. If I wasn't doing this ain't no telling where I'd be right now or what I'd be doing. So that's basically how I feel about him and the misconception or misunderstanding of what we got here, for all of us ain't stupid. Some of us been to school. It just because I personally like having sex, I don't mind getting paid for it. That's how it is for me. If I could have fun and enjoy myself and make money, it's all good. Dr. Forest, dial 12 please. Dr. Forest, please deal 118. Hi. I was told I could pay for a room here. Okay. Patient's name? Joshua Valentine. Oh, let me see. You must be his oldest. Lance, right? No. Sugar. All right. Well, these are fixed rates. For a larger private, it is $600 a week. Full private, 1000. You get television, cable and phone charges are separate in both. I'll take the full private one. Okay, would you like to pay with the credit card or installment plan? I'll pay cash. All right. I will put in this request for you. However, we won't be able to do anything until tomorrow morning. Okay. All right, that's cool. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Hey. You damned near scare me. Hey man, how you doing? Oh, your old man is all right, baby. Except for what when try to feed me this ol' fucked up hospital food. Well, we working on that. How's Naomi? I kicked that bitch out. She walked out on ya. Yeah. How's that little blind girl doing? She's still blind. What's the word tonight? How are you doing in the game, Sugar? I'm doing all right. You know shit in this piece is changing nowadays. You know that, right? Pimpin' is a dying breed nowadays, Sugar. All these young niggas, they done wanna be drug dealers and hustlers and taken all the respectability out of the game. See, four or five good hoes, it's like money in the bank. You can get yourself four or five good ones and treat them with respect, and you can get respect anywhere in the country. Here. Here, pop. Oh, shit. I want you to take care of yourself, pop. Yeah. - I love you now. - I love you too. You gotta take stock, Sugar. Get yourself two or three good hoes. Put them on the stroll. One bitch can't feed you nowadays. It says that in the Bible. Any other problem, is you got a lot of renegade hoes out there. Hoes that's horny for crack. $5 pussy. Back in the day, we was gentlemen. Ain't no respectability no more. Nowadays, people look at pimps like we two bits of skin peddlers. You know what I'm saying? How are you feeling tonight, Mr. Valentine? Oh, I'm feeling fine, baby. I'm feeling better now than I've seen you. Okay. How are you doing today? I'm good. One of my little friend. I want you to take care of yourself, pop. Yeah, I'm a make it through this, man. This ain't nothing. Pimpin' is hard, this ain't none. Don't fuck your head up with all this thinking. This is the natural order of things, Sugar. That's what I tried to teach you and your brother when I put you in the game. You either pimpin' or you hoein'. Ain't nothing in the middle. That's really everything in life. You gotta be different, Sugar. You gotta take your game to the next level. These young niggas is beating these bitches. Don't you do that. Treat 'em with respect. Treat 'em like family and they do anything you need. They'll always be there for you. You hear what I'm telling you?

What's up, pretty? Clap your hand, man. Yeah, next to your hand, baby. You just walked in when some danger about to happen. Just like I was saying, it's a catch 22. My bitch becomes trustworthy, I love her. If I show her love, she become trustworthy. It's how that shit rock. How you know that she trustworthy, Smooth? 'Cause I can just tell, nigga. It's all in the eyes. If a bitch out there doing wrong, being shifty and shit like that, then she can't look you straight in the face 'cause she know the same nigga she doing wrong is the nigga that's loving her. There's some psychology love shit. I figured it out. I feel ya. It's all in the eyes, baby. It's all in the eyes. The eyes, huh? That's right. What if one of your bitches is cross eyed? What the fuck are you gonna think of that shit? Well, Holly, it started out in college. That's when I was approached by a few people and I'd be going to a club and they'd offer me money. And I, you know, I thought, fuck sweet. I get to go out, party. I meet someone I like and fuck 'em. I was gonna fuck 'em anyway probably. So you know, but yeah... So that's how it kind of, it started. So like I was saying, I goes to the bitches back, you know what I'm saying? I'm starting to see all kinds of shit. I'm seeing receipt breakdowns. I'm seeing hair salami seeds. Man, I even saw some shit from the motherfucking bull. Let me tell you, man. I'm thinking this bitch out there getting my motherfucking money. You know this bitch somewhere sipping some motherfucking cognac listening to Johnny Coltrane or some shit. Man, I could beat these bitches asses. I don't have a pimp for many reasons. I just have no problems really finding work on my own. So I don't need someone to take some of my money. I don't need someone to share it with. I don't need someone to watch out for me. A pimp does, you know, as much as they can and that's... Fuck, it's still not that much. You see, that's some bull shit to me. Discipline's not mine. Shit, ain't that the truth. Yeah, let a bitch try to skim on me. The capped on player. You know, it ain't always gotta be the bitch, man. Everybody at this table knows. Let's talk about the attitude. It's the attitude. I can't believe that. See, that's why I don't fuck with the sisters. High maintenance, man. Cutting into my profits. I gotta go down there and bail your ass out every 15 minutes. Yo, that last bitch you had. She be trouble for real. That bitch in jail every motherfucking other day. This bitch argue with everybody. She arguing with the cops. She arguing with the trick. She arguing with the other hoes. This bitch would have argued with Jesus Christ. If she went to church. I know this, man. But a motherfucking cop be fucking with these white bitches. That's the shit. See, these motherfucking tricks, they look at my bitches and they see they nieces, They see they daughters in my bitches eyes, man. It ain't no cost to me, man. I cater to businessman. Japanese businessmen, white businessmen. They ain't scared of my white hoes. They scared of these sisters. And it don't matter, man. Pimpin' is the only motherfucking thing where you can sell a product, keep it and sell it again. Just like everything else in America, man. White sells. That's deep. There are times when I'd like a pimp. Once in a while, I'd like someone just to have my back. It gets rough out there sometimes, you know? And shit happens. So it'd be nice if there was somebody who had my back once in a while. What's wrong with him? What the fuck is wrong with you, Sugar? You've been acting funny since you walked up in this motherfucker. I think I'm gonna have a early night, man. Already, man? Oh man, sit down. Let me open a can of whoop ass.

It bothers me. Okay. Sugar. Yeah. Where are you? I'm in the kitchen, baby. - Sugar. - Yeah, baby. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, anything. When are you gonna let me work? I'm not sure, man. Why aren't you sure? Look, for one thing, I don't know... I don't know how to say this. Just say it, baby. I don't know too many blind hookers. And? And I don't know if the fact that you can't see is gon' be a... What the hell am I talking about? Of course it's gonna be a problem. Can we talk about this tomorrow, man. I'm a keep it real with you. I'd be out here doing this shit anyway. And at least with a pimp, I have some type of security. Someone who understands what I'm going through. These girls out here that don't have a pimp, those are the girls that you find stuffed in a fucking garbage can, or are strung out or something like that. Like just last week, this girl, she don't got no pimp. She's out here by herself. Next thing you know, she's fucking dead. She doesn't got no job security, and that's what that means to me, having a pimp. Is job security. Hey, honey. Hey, what's up there? What you need? Nah, let me get a Pit Bull. One Pit Bull. So what's up? Nothing, I'm chilling. What's been going on with you? This. A little this and a little that? A little this and a little more this? I hear you. You know that girl over there? Not really? She comes in here like every night, I don't know, for about a week now. Orders the same bowl of soup. Probably working the strip, one of those girls. I don't know. I'm a have much money now. Mind your business. Let me talk to her. Hey Foxy Brown? Who are you? Superfly? Good one, that's a good one. Superfly. You got me on that one. So, you mind if I sit down? Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Are you out here solo? Yeah. See, one day I got this flash. It was like a revelation. I can be my own pimp. I'm gonna make myself rich. And if I get out of line, I kick the shit out of my own ass. See, in my mind, I need a little sex to me. You know, that's the problem with you independent mindeds. You know what I'm saying? Y'all go out there and talking about, look, I don't need no pimp, I don't need this. I don't need that. I wanna be independent. You know, I'm watching Oprah Winfrey. I'm all... Hey, let me tell you something. What? When you get in the car with some weirdo- - Okay, so you're gonna save me from the weirdos? Yeah, exactly. I see. So then, who's gonna save me from you? Is that so? See, I make more money than you'll probably ever see. You wanna know why? No, why? 'Cause the hoe that I pimp, she doesn't steal from me. Yeah, in the hood I'm selling pussy. That's what I do. And I'm a always do that and it ain't gon' change. Everybody love pussy. You can't change that. I didn't do it. I didn't create it. But I'm capitalizing off of it. Thing about pussy that people don't understand is it stops wars. Out there in the Middle East, you got them fighting and killing each other over this shit. But what you could do is, you can get you some pussy shipped out there and I guarantee you stop that bullshit going on. Good morning, Sugar. Hey, I didn't mean to wake you up. You didn't. Tonight, baby? All right. Put you out on the track tonight. We're offering $50,000 to anyone who can give any substantial lead as to my daughter's whereabouts. Why the decision to go public, Senator? My daughter's worth whatever it takes to get her back. Senator, do you think your daughter's run will be a campaign issue next year? My daughter's safe return is the most important thing to me right now. Senator, was your daughter on drugs? No, I don't believe she was. Could she have been kidnapped, Senator? We believe that she's acting on her own volition, but we're not ruling anything out right now. Are you running for the presidency, Senator? At this time, I'm quite satisfied with my service as the Senator to the state of California. Would your daughter's incident affect that in any way, Senator? I believe it would.

Your brother was around here last night. Even looking like a fine cat too. He must be doing pretty good in the street. He gave me a $20 tip. My pimp is like my man.

Skipped some kind of political prosecution back in China. Family was involved with some heavy shit down there. Anyway, one thing leads to another and bam, eight years later, dude owns like a string of Chinese restaurants across Hollywood. So one night, I get a craving for broccoli and chicken wings. You ever tried broccoli and chicken wings? No, not really. Not that I remember. Okay, so where was I? Broccoli and chicken wings. Right, right, right, right, right. By the way, I show you where you can get some really good broccoli and chicken wings. So anyway, I'm standing there, I'm waiting on my order, and this dude walks in and decides that he's gonna rob the place. - No! - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So now I'm mad as hell. 'Cause all the nights this dude could've picked, he picks the night that I'm waiting on my shit. So I'm thinking, what can I do? So it's not like, I'm gonna jump in front of no bullet or nothing like that. So out of sheer self interest now, I decide to convince the dude not to rob the Chinese restaurant, but go hit the Spanish bodega on the corner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, some crazy shit. Yo, he's standing there and the dude is thanking me for the tip. I mean, we smilin' and exchanging telephone numbers and everything. And ever since then, we've been buddies ever since. Lee Chen, he was the one who owned the Chinese restaurant? Nope. He owned the bodega that got robbed that night. So that's when he decided it was safer to go into the restaurant business. So that's why you were at the depot? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So over the years, I do favors for him, he does favors for me, you know, like friends do. And yesterday I was supposed to pick the sister up for him since, you know, he was a little tied up at the restaurant and everything, and voila. What's wrong? Thank you so much for letting me crash here last night. I really, I'd like to... Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on now. No need for all that. It wasn't like I was gonna let you sleep on that bench, girl. Plus, you know, I kinda figured you wanted to see Hollywood. Come here, girl. Everything is gonna be all right. Hey, man. Is Sosa around? For what? Talk to him about some business, man. Back there. Mr. Valentine. Where can we find good, honest help these days? Nowhere I tell you. Nowhere. Now, what can I do for you, my friend? Mr. Sosa, I was wondering if I can have a little more time with the loan. More time. Let me ask you a question, Mr. Valentine. Did you know that my father died when I was six years old? So I was left to take care of my mother. And then my sister is dying from a terminal illness, and has less than a week to live. And that I have 13 sons that I provide for in the Dominican Republic. And they each have to get their monthly allowance by tomorrow. Do you know these things? No, Mr. Sosa. Do you know why you don't know those things? Because it's embarrassing. And also because I choose not to share them with people. Because if people knew of such things, they probably wouldn't want to borrow money from me, and then I'd be out of business, wouldn't I? So I keep them to myself until someone walks in here and tells me that I will not have money in time to bury my sister. Or that my mother can go to the hell. Or that my sons will rot in the hot sun of the Dominican Republic. Then that person becomes an enemy and not a friend. So you see, Mr. Valentine, your time is really running out because of things I cannot control. So there's really not much more for us to discuss. Good night. All right. Oh, by the way, Mr. Valentine, if it's help that you're looking for to pay back the loan, word has it that your brother is doing pretty well for himself these days. That's all right. I'll get you your money, Mr. Sosa. Hello? Yeah, this is Sugar. Hey look, look, Sammy, man. I already told you I'm gonna find a way to get you the money. I don't care what the word on the street is, man. I already told you. It's like I'm going through a little turbulence right now. A little melodrama. You know, this shit happens all the time, man. Look, y'all always get y'all money, right? All right, man. I'll have the money for you by Friday. Is that it? Is everything okay? Excuse me. I said, is everything okay? What, did you wake up on the right side of bed this morning? Funny. Listen, I wanna apologize. I know I was a little rude the other day. So I'm sorry. Okay. Apology accepted. By the way, I never got your name. It's Sugar. Sugar Valentine. Sweet. - Sweet. - Sweet. So, you've been a pimp long? A little while now. So you've been hooking long? - Me? - Yeah. You. Yeah, a little while. Okay. That's funny 'cause I ain't seen you around here before since the other night. That's 'cause I was working in the Bay Area. The Bay Area. A lot of money in the Bay Area. What you doin' out here in Hollywood? What, are you a cop or something? A cop. Yeah. Bonnie Miller. All right, if you really must know, I got into a little beef with my old man in the Bay Area. I needed a fresh start and Hollywood looked like a good place to come. So anyways, I'm looking for my kid sister too. Kinda cute. She reminds me of somebody. She ain't blind, is she? Excuse me? Forget it. Nah, I ain't seen her. Are you sure she's in Hollywood? 'Cause you know, LA is a pretty big city. For all you know, she could probably still be up in the Bay. Yeah, well, I got relatives looking there too. I was thinking though, maybe you could help me talk to some people. Why would you think that? My mama always said, "You never know unless you ask." Well, my mother always said, "Boy, stop walking on the back of that shoe. You know how much I paid for those things?" That's what my mama used to say. Anyway, read your manual. Pimps recruit. We don't deliver. How about we make a deal? How about I give up my solo lifestyle, and I come to work for you exclusively? Give me a second to think about that. You got yourself a deal. ♪ Hey ma, what's happenin' ♪ ♪ I mean, I see you've been lookin' at me all night ♪ ♪ I know you got some on your mind ♪ ♪ It's a normal thing ♪ ♪ Holler at your boy ♪ - What's up, Smooth? - What's up, Sugar? - What's up, baby? - I'm feeling real good. Listen man, I'm looking for this white girl, man. Have you seen her? I haven't seen her, man. Hey, Curly. I don't mean to bother you man, but I'm looking for the girl. Have you seen her around? Nah. That's the ugliest bitch I've seen all my life, but who is she? Her sister. Damn! This is an everyday thing with me. Bitch, you think I'm out here half time pimpin', part-time pimpin', bitch. I pimp in overdrive. These other suckers pimp in neutral, bitch. As a matter of fact, your bitch ass pimpin' in reverse right now, I need my money. So whatever you got to do, baby, bring my motherfucking money. I need my goddam cash. I ain't got time to wait on y'all hoes to bring me my money. Hold on, bitch. Yo, C. What's up man? Hey, what's up? We are looking for this girl right here. You seen her? Nah, Sugar. I ain't seen her, man. But shit, she kinda fine though. This is what you look for, huh? Tell you what I do. If I run across a bitch, I'll give you a holler out. That's how we do it. You know, from one pimp to another. All right, bitch, I'm back now. What was I saying? Bitch, I need my motherfucking money.

Do you know what they call a Big Mac in France in the hood? Big Mac? Nah, motherfucking Big Mac. I'll have a motherfucking Big Mac please. You just didn't go there. How long you been in these streets? This area, like Hollywood. I don't know. I've been out here for a couple of years now. Are you from there? Originally, I'm from the East coast. Moved out here with my brother and my dad. New York? Philly Philly. I've never been to Philly. - Good steaks. - That's the truth. Good steaks. Good steaks, and cheese. Yeah, you heard of Philly steaks and cheese? Yeah, I heard it. Hey, I'm really happy I met you. Yeah, me too. I've had fun. I've really had fun. And then look, we gon' find your sister too. We gon' find her. Yeah. The things that people share with you, you don't get that in any other job. I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, this guy just got dumped by his girlfriend. Who does he come to? He comes to me. He could've gone anywhere but he came to me. And he has a ring in his pocket that he was gonna give to her, he gave it to me instead. He could've taken it back to the store, got his money back, but he gave it to me. He had no reason to do that. And you know, I could go hock this, good hook up, 100 bucks, but it means a lot to me. I wouldn't do that. And that's just kind of people that you meet in this job. Somebody different every day and every single person that I meet, they change me in a small little way. I change them. They change me. We leave a mark on each other that never goes away. And whether it's good or bad, whoever that trick is that I meet, that person is forever gonna change my life. They leave this small little mark on my soul. Thanks for bringing me out here today. I know you got a lot going on. It's really pretty out here. You never been out here before? No, I just got to LA like two years ago. You know, I own a couple of these boats. - Really? - Nah, I'm just kidding. You're silly. So what'd you wanna talk about? Do you find me attractive at all? Yes. I find you very attractive. Stupid question. No, no. It's not a stupid question. Why do you ask me that? You never tried to holler at me before. I see you talking to chicks and it's like, you never say two words to me in that way. Do you know what I do? I mean, you know what I do for a living? Yeah, I know what you do. Okay. Well, I've never looked at you like that. You're still going to college? I wanna keep going. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. You stay in school, you keep working at the restaurant and I help you out from time to time. You can do that for me? Yeah. God, no one ever done anything like that for me before. Call me? I will.

That's a Billy Dee line. He said that to Diana Ross in one of those movies. What am I supposed to do with this? I mean, anything you like. But most women usually take it home, put some water in 'em and stuff. I mean, I didn't mean it like that. Nah, it's cool. It's cool. Hey, read the card. Excuse me. I wrote it. If true love can blind, then let me see no longer. Will you be there as my guide, we'll develop in 2020. Sugar. You know, you're the first woman I ever had the guts to give one of my poems to. Actually, I gave my mom one when I was a kid. And then I gave one to this other girl who used to... Oh yeah. - You know- - Maybe we should- Maybe we should go. You know, you remind me of Niskayuna. Niska who? Niskayuna. Niska who? It's a place, not a person. It's like the Garden of Eden. It's got flowers and it's got birds and it's got cottages. Sometimes in late May or early April, you get the smell of like sunflowers and pollen and it's just so beautiful. You remind me of that place. Okay. So I remind you of... - Niskayuna. - Okay. When I look in your eyes, I get the same feeling I get when I'm up there. And what's this feeling? Like I wanna live there forever. I thought today was your day off. It is, sir. I needed to talk. What can I do for you? It's about the Fuller case. How you doin' man? You lied to me. You told me you were going to take care of yourself but, you're not looking too good. Hey, the nurse outside said that, you done got all the hoes locked up on this floor. I got some good news too. I met this girl. She's fine as hell. You'd like her too. She's so wonderful. And I've been thinking. I want out the game, man. I mean, I want a family, I want a house. I want some kids. And let's face it. I wasn't really that good at pimping anyway. Anyway, I got some stuff to go take care of. Take care of yourself, man. Honey, it's okay. You nervous? A little bit, I guess. Well, you'll always be nervous the first time. Ain't nothing to it. Here, take a hit of this. I don't want to. Trust me. I wouldn't give you nothing to hurt you, baby girl. Could I do it later, Lance? I promise. I think I'll feel more comfortable later. Sure. No problem. It's okay. Now, you remember what we talked about? Let's review them. First, if the cars are marked, you don't get in. Remember, we prefer a two-door to four-door. Second, you don't discuss price. You let him do the talking. I mean, you can ask him if he needs someone to hang out with, needs someone to talk to, that kind of thing. But then, you look at his watch and his shoes. They never lie. When you get in, take 'em straight to the Wind General Hotel on 35th. If he wants to stop off for a bite to eat, a sandwich or a drive through or just to pick up cigarettes, gum whatever, you ain't interested, so you just get out. And you get to the Wind Gen, ask for Mikey. Tell him you want room 403. I got an account over there. Your service is standard. None of that freaky shit. You take exact cash only. He pays first and you do not give change. If he wants to get undressed, that's his choice. You don't. Got that, baby? And remember, I'll be there the whole night watching just to make sure you okay. Who is it? What the fuck you want, man? To talk. About? I got a problem. Let's make this shit quick, man. You know I got business to take care of. Okay. Look, regardless of how you may feel about me, man, we're still family. And I know even since we were kids, like we never really seen things eye to eye. Well, anyway man, in the last couple of months, the old man has been moved to the intensive care unit over at King's County and his situation has gotten worse. Well, anyway, in the last couple of months, man, I've been kind of taking care of the bills and stuff. And I'm not saying that I can't, it's just that I just borrowed some money and I got into a little situation. So what you want from me? I don't know, man. I was just thinking that maybe, you know... I just thought that maybe you could help some... You know him? No. What the fuck's wrong with you, nigga? You high, motherfucker? You on crack? No. I just forgot some, man. Basically, if you don't have what I need, you gotta keep it moving with speed. A lot of jobs, a lot of guys coming here, talking about they wanna see me, they want to take me somewhere and they got $200. Who the fuck I look like? So I need somebody that's comin' with real cheese. I choose my customers. They don't choose me. Niggas roll up all the time trying to holler. But if they money ain't right, they car ain't right, they clothes ain't looking right, I'm not getting in the car with them. So that's the part of control, I have. I could choose whoever I wanna fuck, where I wanna fuck him, how I wanna fuck him. So it's like, I'm a business woman. This is my business. I run it how I wanna run it. A lot of bitches out here jumping and crying when nearly everybody bought 50 bucks, anything. That's like, all right, that's your hustle. That's why your clothes is looking like that. You know what I'm saying? That's why I'm geared up and you're not. So just gotta run your business right. Thanks for meeting me out here. When I was a kid, my dad used to bring me and my brother up here and we would just chill. Just kind of watch the cars go by and we would just pick out the cars we wanted. Red, that's mine. Blue, that's mine. It's funny because white parents take their kids fishing. My dad took us to the roof. ♪ The roof, the roof ♪ ♪ The roof is on fire ♪ Sometimes it's hard to believe that this is the same place I grew up in. Hollywood. It's changed a lot. Yeah, I know what you mean. Everything okay? What's with the long face? Nothing. Come on. Whenever you say nothing, I know it means something. What's wrong? You know, it's cold. It's cold out here. Well, it's cold out here. Damn, you look like a pimp in my coat. Thank you. Do you ever think about doing something else? Something else like what? I don't know, like a normal job. Yeah. I thought about it. Maybe one day, get my book of poems published or something like that. Sure. I mean, I don't know. It's not like you just go and get your book published. You gotta prepare for that. You just gotta psychologically get yourself worked up. It's like, Maya Angelou didn't just wake up and get her book published. You know, she was grinding for years. What's stopping you, huh? I kinda wanna be discovered. It's a better story. That way, you got something interesting to talk to Jay Leno about. Like if I'm sitting on the couch, I'm gonna be like, "You know what, Jay? The pimping game got a little..." Stop. Stop. What about you? - Me? - Yeah, yeah. You ever think of doing something else? From what? From, do you have some other profession we don't know about? I just don't feel like talking about this right now. I'm sorry. Come, come, come. Jump, jump. What's wrong with you? You haven't talked since the roof. It's Erin. I saw her tonight. What? Yeah. Well, why didn't you tell me? Look, I don't want you tripping. I just didn't wanna get you all worked out. Sugar, you know how important this is to me. I just... Well, just take me to her. I can't. It's not like we can just go and just grab her from where she's at. Well, why not? Just trust me, we can't, but we'll get her though. Just give me some time. - Okay. - All right? Sure. What up, Sug? My man, Sug. What's up, man? Hi, Sugar. Where are you? Right here, in front of you. Oh. Baby, I've been kind of thinking. Thinking about what? That maybe tomorrow I go back to my uncle's house. You know, go back to school. I really don't think this life is for me. That's good. I'm a drop you off tomorrow. Okay. Yeah man, I need a vacation. Sounds like fun. Yeah. All right, that's our guy. All right, suspect is moving. Let's get ready to roll. Hey, what's up, Kool? What's going on, man? What's going on, man? Pimpin' ain't easy but sure is necessary, ain't it? So, I heard you wanted to see me, man. What's going on? Yeah, man. It's about that white girl you been rolling with. Rachel? What about her? Stay away from her, Sugar. She's undercover, man. What the fuck you talking about? She busted two of my regulars the other night. Bitch packing a badge and everything. Sure about this? Yeah, man. I'm sure. Snow was eyeing her. He sent one of his white girl to scope her out, see where her head is at. She definitely undercover, man. You all right? Yeah, man. What time you got? It's 11:30. Somebody I gotta take care of, man. Got to go. All right. Handle your business. Yo Lance, I need to talk to you, man. What the fuck you want now, man? I thought I told you before to stop using that crack. It ain't about that, man. It's about her. Let me see about her. Okay, go in the car. Now, what the fuck's on your mind little brother? I mean, you're violating, scheming a home mom bitch. What you talking about, man? I'm talking about, you need to back off. Yo look, man. It's bigger than you think. Every single cop in this city is looking for that white girl. Man, fuck you, man. I don't think you understand, man. Look, Lance. You can't turn that white girl out. Can't get turned out. Well, who the fuck are you? Her fairy motherfucking godmother? What? You captain save a hoe? Flying around the ghetto saving hoes. I mean you come in front of my fucking house to tell me about my bitch. Well look, you know what? You family, right? So I'm gonna tell your ass this shit one last time. You in violation, man. What are you talking about, violation? You're talking food off my plate, nigga. That's how? Now, that bitch is subject to get broken. Come on, tell me. Tell me it ain't true. That you tried to play me out like that. Say something. Look, it wasn't supposed to happen like that. I can't believe this shit. Why? I don't know what to say, except I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you, even though as much as you tried, every time I looked at your face, I kept seeing a pimp. Even a pimp has a heart. Even a pimp, officer. If it means anything to you at all, I'd asked them to take me off the case when I realized I was getting in too deep. Too deep? Too deep? What do you think this is? A game? I was going to change my life for you. You know what happens when a guy falls in love? That's like the essence of deepness. I'm sorry. I learned a lot though. Fuck your sermon. I don't really care what you learned. See, it's your actions that's speaking loud to me right now. But you know what? Before tonight, I thought there was a really big difference between you and most of the girls that work out here. Congratulations, Rachel. You just turned your first trick. Yeah, I got some family but... What's there to tell about that? No, my mom died. She died when I was fairly young and I lived with my stepdad who was a fucking nightmare. And I wanted out of that house as soon as possible. So I got a scholarship, went to college and then moved on from there. So I don't give a fuck about him, but I do think about my sister once in a while. I think about her a lot. So, you know, she's still in the house with them. So she's considerably younger than me. And you know, I wanna be there kind of like, I don't want to be there for it, but you gotta do what you gotta do. You want my arm to fall off? Anyway, you're lucky to be alive. How are you feeling? What do you care? I'm a pimp, remember? I came here to say that I'm sorry. Sorry for what? For settin' me up? For lyin'? For being a cop? Which one? I wanna apologize for everything. I realized I didn't give you the chance, and if you wanna change your life I think you should be given a chance to do that. Was that one of your big revelations? So anyway, whatever happened last night, if you wanna follow up, there's an officer outside. No, it's cool. Just a couple people I owe some money to. That's all. They don't like waitin'. Anything I can do to help? Nope. I think you've done enough. Thanks. I'd really like to visit. What the hell are you talking about now? Niskayuna. You said it was a beautiful place and I'd really like to visit. They found this in the back alley. I thought you might want it, you know. You know your way with words. You've got some real talent. Excuse me. You Sugar Valentine? Look, I already told the officer I don't wanna press any charges. That's an entirely different matter. We have a warrant for your arrest. My arrest? What are you talking... Class E misdemeanor. Interfering with governmental operations. Valentine, you made bail. Come on, let's go. Well, the man of the hour. I'm Senator Shawn Fuller. Erin Fuller's my daughter. I believe you're familiar with her. Yeah. In this case, I guess I owe you this. $50,000? You helped find my daughter and in the process you saved my family. Thank you. Got any plans what you're gonna do with it? Got a couple of Dominicans I need to go see. Thanks. You did it. All I did was make some phone calls, make sure you got your reward. I've been thinking. I'm ready to get out the life. Really? I can't do this no more. That's right. But first, I got a book I gotta start writing. Nice. You take care of yourself, okay? You too. ♪ Ride boy ♪ ♪ Help me when we get down boy ♪ ♪ Now, I want you to get with me tonight ♪ ♪ I wanna make you feel just fine ♪ I stopped pimpin' about 15 years, 20 years ago. Yeah. I stopped pimpin' about 15 to 20 years ago. But when I stopped pimpin' it never stopped me from going to pen. I kept going to pen because there was things I was still trying to do, but that was in my head, but my heart wasn't in what I was doing. But today I can say my life a lot different because I put my heart into what I wanted and I show a lot of love. But you know, most of all, I think about him, I miss my father, 'cause he was a big impact in my life. He taught me a lot, man. He taught me about living, man. He taught me about the right things in life to do. But I was there for him, man. And he was there for me too. It hurt inside, you know. Just being life and missing some of the good things. Today, I think about him a lot, man. And I hurt inside, you know, from... There were so many things in life, man, that I wanted to do that I couldn't do, man. I'm still carrying a lot of hurt inside. The girl in my life that came in my life, she brought me a lot of joy. But after I found out where she was at, I didn't have nobody, man. I was all out there by myself, man.
