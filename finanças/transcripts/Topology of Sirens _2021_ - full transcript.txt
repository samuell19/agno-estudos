Hey. Yeah. Yeah good! Just settling in. Mm. Mm-hm. You want the tone just to be just professional? Okay. Yeah I'll have it. Yeah, I'll have time later today. Okay. Yeah, talk tomorrow. Bye. You've reached the offices of Professor Gregory Klein, department of Archaeology. Office hours are Monday and Wednesday 12:00 to 2:00 PM. Please leave a message of any length and he'll return your call as soon as possible. Thank you. You reached the offices of Professor Gregory Klein Department of Archaeology. Office hours are Monday and Wednesday. Hey, I'm Cas. - Hi. Do you not remember me? - No. I used to study with Belinda. Actually, I'm a good friend of Whitney's. We play together. - Yeah. - Do you play any instruments? Um, I studied piano. Oh, okay, with Belinda. - Yeah, we did when we were kids, but, um- - Yeah. Yeah. I don't like, I don't not so much play anymore, but I studied classical, so it's, it's hard when I've tried to, in college I tried to be part of a jazz thing but it's like hard for me to break the meter, I guess. I know that feeling. - Really? - Yeah. - I think everybody- - Yeah. Every classical person does. - Absolutely. - Is it raining? - It is raining. - Oh wow. - It is. - Still a sprinkle ...out of nowhere. Sun to rain. - Feels refreshing. I like it. - Yeah. - It's nice change. - Yeah. You know what they call this? Every culture has a name for this and it's, in some cultures, it's like a fox is marrying a rabbit, and in others it's like an owl is marrying a hippopotamus but every culture has these sort of wedding names for when- Oh wow. - Sun and rain happen at the same time. - Amazing. Is that where the cats and dogs expression comes from? Oh, interesting, yeah. I guess I don't think of cats and dogs as so different. It's coming down hard. - Pets. - Are you okay? I think I need a bit more, yeah. - Do you need help? - Yeah, absolutely. Here. We can help. Yeah. - Unplug this. - Oh. ♪ Don't you know that you want me too ♪ ♪ And I'm thinkin about ya, baby, holding calmly onto me ♪ ♪ Don't you know that you wanna be free ♪ ♪ Sometimes you've been thinking all around you ♪ ♪ Don't you know, that I could be there, baby, for you ♪ ♪ Don't you be just another flower movin' on now ♪ ♪ Don't be like the breeze and just go driftin' by ♪ Do you know the Veda says that we choose our parents in order to have the challenges that growing through will give us the tools that we need to have for our own personal growth. So clearly you chose this in all of its glory. Yes. It's my power. It, absolutely, we are victims of nothing except bonsais. The house literally glowed with this freakish pink light. I mean, it looked like we were running a bordello. All for those little trees. That's wild. How is it now? The trees? - Yeah. - Small. Shush. You know, they look nice. Do you know if Belinda ever played hurdy-gurdy? Hurdy? What? You know what it is. Like, it's like, it looks like a violin but kind of big. Has a crank on the side and... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's a hurdy-gurdy? - Yeah. Why would you think she played hurdy-gurdy? Because I found one in the back closet. The bedroom closet. I thought you left it for me. She was into some interesting things, your aunt, but I cleaned out that whole house and especially the closets and. - That's weird. - Huh. Hi. Oh, hey, how you doing? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm good. I'm good. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, of course. - I found these cassettes. - Mm-hm. And I'm wondering if you have a player that can play them. We probably should. We've got a whole bunch of stuff. Um. You're playing a video game? No, it's actually this guy right here. It's just a little kind randomized tone generator. You can play around with it if you want. Changes the range, that one, little bit of portamento. Yeah, some of them don't do anything but little experiment I've been working on. Doesn't have a name yet so if you have any suggestions, just, uh, just let me know. - I'll think about it. - Cool, cool. Um, I think we should probably have what you need in back. Uh, follow me and, uh, see what we got. Sure. So I know they're gonna be somewhere on this side. How old is this place? It's about 75 years old. It was my grandfather's and then my father's and now it's mine. Do you like working here? I think so. I mean, it's kind of just my thing at this point. - All right, here we go. - Oh good. Yeah, you can just have them to be honest. Really? Yeah. I mean, they're taking up space. I don't even know if they all work. So they're yours. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. Thanks very much. Yeah, you gonna be doing some old school reporting with them or what's going on? Some new school detective work. Some detective work. All right. We think. - And a shovel. - Mm-hm. I mean, there's nothing like the French harpsichord starting to sound, uh, natural. They were gotten before that. I have another, um. Playing this for his death, basically. What are you giving away? "Just William". What's, what's William? No. It wasn't worth hanging on to. Ooh, Pern, "Dragon Writers of Pern. - I read that. - Oh wow. Should I do it? It's like young adult sci-fi. - Emily Dickinson, look. - Oh, yeah. He's diving into the shallow end of the pool and they're rocks and... but you can see underneath the surface of the water. And so you understand that there's a risk there but he's wearing goggles and diving directly onto the hard- Illusion of safety. Do you feel like, does it sound the same every time? Probably doesn't sound exactly the same, but try to, yeah, it's a composition. So I try to follow the same series of intentions, steps, actions. What, where do you start from? Like what is your intention with it? I don't know. I think it's almost a little more scientific where it's like I know something will happen in terms of the phenomenon of sound between these two frequencies. Let that unfold kind of as I know it will. Yeah. Does that make sense? Sort of. Programming from KTXT is brought to you in part by viewers like you. - I'm sorry. - Hello. Is this KTXT the station? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I used to watch this channel when I was a little girl but I thought it went off the air years ago. No, no. Never went off the air. Um, I mean, things have progressed, evolved with the station just like the community has. Um, technology's changed. Production facilities have changed, but you know people still send us their, their tapes, you know, I mean some of this stuff like this guy just started recording snow right before the advent of digital 'cause he wanted people to still be able to watch analog television snow. So we broadcast that a couple times a week. But, yeah, all kinds of stuff. Don't people just think their TV is broken? I dunno. I guess it's not my problem. - Can I ask a question? - Yeah. Do you know this woman? Who is it? It's my aunt. No, don't know your aunt. Did she work here or something? I don't think so, but I'm staying at her house and I came across these tapes and this one has a KTXT jingle playing on it. And it's the only thing that I can make out on any of them. Ah, what kind of jingle? Just people singing. But male or female? Female. That would be Jenny George. Jenny was everybody's favorite jingle singer. She didn't just do us she did a few other local businesses, radio, TV. But you could just spot her voice from anywhere, across the street. You'd hear her and you'd say, well you probably wouldn't say that's Jenny George. 'Cause most people didn't know her name. Jingle singers don't tend to get credit. But we got fan mail for her. She was, she was everybody's favorite. - Hmm. - Yeah. Whoa. I did remember the symbol. Can you play it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean it got boxed up with everything else and I don't know, I've probably nobody's looked at it in- A selection of fine instruments from the 17th and 18th century. For all your hurdy-gurdy needs, come to Curtiss Hurdy-Gurdy Emporium. What are you reading about? It's a little nerdy, but I was reading about pipe organs, the history of them and I read that in like whenever the Reformation happened in like the 15th century or something. I don't know my dates but apparently the church used the organ as like, look at this cool toy that we have. Come back to the church. - Wow. - To like lure people back in. - Marketing? - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. They already had the organs but they were- They had the organs but they didn't really use them that much. But then like when people started veering off away from Catholicism, they were like, no, no, no. Come back. Look. Look at this like crazy thing. - Showing the- - Yeah, yeah. - It works for me. - I thought that's kind of funny. - Yeah. - Yeah, totally. It draws me back into the churches- - Totally, what it's was. - That I wouldn't inhabit. - Me too. - Yeah. It's the only reason. - When- - It's funny to think of people at a different time thinking of like the same things. - Yeah. - I like that. - Thank you. - Yes. How old are, when are, like, do organs precede the piano or are organs at the same time as harpsichords? - Organs are like ancient. - Oh. They had, like, water organs in Egypt. - Greece. - Wow, what? Yeah, the hydraulics. It was like a water pumped, water powered organ. Like really primitive, like, you know, not big or anything like that. But yeah, they had organs. Organs actually had the same function as bells early on. They were like outdoor instruments that were meant to just be like loud and, you know, like part of a procession or whatever. - Hi. - Hello. I have found a hurdy-gurdy. - Oh. - I think. And I was wondering if I could show it to you. Oh yes. That's a very old one. The style of the 17th century. Oh. I've been looking for one of these myself. Where'd you find this? It's actually, I think, belonged to my aunt who is a musician, but it was in her closet. - But she's... - Is she French? No. This is a very old French instrument. They only made this style in France in the 17th century and it's very rare to find something like this anywhere. Where do you think she would've gotten it? I have no idea. Find something like that. This even has somebody's name. I can see a Joseph. This has a like a compartment here. Yeah. And when I opened it I found these which are like - answering the machine tapes. - Huh. I don't know how that could get in there because usually you kept your cotton and rosin. I would expect to find maybe an old playing card or something in there, but not something modern. I don't know if that's like has no explanation that makes any sense at all. Especially if it's been in that attic for a long time. Would you be interested in selling this one or trading it? I have some that actually play. That's, that's gonna take a lot of restoration. But, uh, this one here is Pierre Louvet from Paris about 1749. Here's one by Coty. It's a recent one. Not much is known about him. This one's made in Versailles. The maker even signed maker to the queen who would've been Marie Antoinette. And then this one though, I think it can't be much better than this. Oh, it's lovely. It's made by Jean-Nicolas Lambert who is considered maybe the best maker of his era because his instruments were the most expensive and this one works really well. What year? Uh, the label inside. So you think you wanna give it a try? Yeah, I would love to. Okay. How old is it? Uh, I think it's from like 1907. - Early 1900s. - Huh. Yeah, they used to use these actually, the ones that fold, um, as, like, chaplain's organs. So like a priest during the First World War could just sort of take it around with him and do impromptu services. - For soldiers? - Yeah, yeah. Nice. Can I ask a question? - Yeah. - What is that? Oh. Oh yeah. That's the tag from the, uh, estate sale that I got this at. I just haven't taken it out. Where? Do you remember? Mm, I don't know. It was a few years ago. Um, I can check when I get home and let you know. Yeah, that'd be great. Sure. Ah, the usual? Here you go. What business do you have with Mr. Pistorius? Oh, no business with him specifically. Well, if you have enough business then? Is he here to talk to you? Oh, no. He passed away many years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. No matter. What brings you here? Well my friend, I think, bought a harmonium from him. Of course, you are looking to buy. Possibly. These are all harpsichords, yes? Mostly, yes. One or two pianos, a Chopin era, a Beethoven era. We rent them out on behalf of the Pistorius' estate mostly to local orchestras, ensembles, private parties. And the paintings. Let us just say they have unspeakably unusual features. Not strictly for sale but we could come to some arrangement. Tell me more. This, an 18th century French painter Donat Nonnotte. Said to be Princess Adelaide of France, the sixth child of Louis XV and Queen Marie. She was believed to be one of Frances's greatest hurdy-gurdy players at the time. You don't know a man named Curtiss, do you? I think I've met a few Curtisses in my time. Why do you ask? No reason. Another hurdy gurdy? Yes. Mr. Pistorius had his preoccupations. This, a 19th century by Achille Leonardi. A depiction from a Donizetti opera "Linda di Chamounix." A wandering young orphan named Pierrot travels the land singing his troubadour songs. The most recent one on display and the only American, Frederick Stuart Church, "The Sirens." A curious choice, one that doesn't seem to align with Mr. Pistorius' general tastes. How do you account for it? Well, he was an eccentric man but there are certainly greater enigmas regarding him than an errant taste in artwork. It's interesting. You can't tell if the one in back is about to embrace her or push her off the cliff. If you say so. - Can I show you something? - Of course. Does this woman look familiar to you? Oh yeah, she does look slightly familiar. I just can't place her. She does bear a stunning resemblance to our Princess Adelaide over there though, wouldn't you say? Maybe. Do these mean anything to you? I say, you should have shown me these straight away. What is this? Another order of the Pistorius estate. Whoever comes bearing those marks is to receive this. What's inside? Not known to me, but rest assured, whatever relics Mr. Pistorius is archiving in here are well worth yours or anyone's time. I'll take your word for it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I hope I've been of help and now I really must get back to work. You understand? Of course. - Go! - Whoa! - All right. - Come on, come on! - Oh! - Go! Excuse me. Can I help you? Do you know when they have games here? Baseball? Yeah, when I'm here there's usually some sort of game going on. Huh? Thank you. Sorry. Some sort of game. These were Aunt Belinda's. Lot of the time we were simply using small boats to, uh, get out to the minor islands, which is where I developed my love for islands and go snorkeling, uh, secluded beaches. Little villages that we stayed in, started off on Ko Pha Ngan and then went out into even smaller islands than that. Indonesia, phew, that's a country of islands. You know, there are, what is it, 13,600 occupied islands in Indonesia. And it always used to be that each one of them had their own language until the country became independent. I was on one of the tributaries of the Yangtze in China. Thought I could swim across the tributary. Somebody had to bail me out because the current was so strong. An anthropologist came to my rescue and dragged me out of the stream. My personal explorations have been just great. Rocks, forests, rivers and mountains, glaciers. Whit? Whit? The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used. And thus, in the case before us, it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner such experiments are conducted. The selection of the plant group which shall serve for experiments of this kind must be made with all possible care if it be desired to avoid from the outset every risk of questionable results. The experimental plants must necessarily, one, possess constant differentiating characters. Two, the hybrids of such plants must during the flowering period be protected from the influence of all foreign pollen or be easily capable of such protection. It has so far been found to be just as impossible to draw a sharp line between the hybrids of species and varieties as between species and varieties themselves. - To second! - Go home! Go! Let's go. Keep trying, keep trying. Get him! It's okay, buddy. Just give it your best. Whoo! - Nice! - Play it! Foul ball! Who cares? - Foul ball! - Whoa! Let's go! Whoo! Oh, nice! Okay, here we go. Oh! That's fair.
