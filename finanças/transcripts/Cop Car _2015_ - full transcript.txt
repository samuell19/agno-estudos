No. Not that I can think of. I tried lo radio in to y'all ladies. (STAMMERS) You didn't hear that? Oh, no-Must not be coming through. (SCOFFS) I see that I thought y'all was just giving me the cold shoulder. (LAUGHS) Never, Sheriff. Okay, well, I'm gonna see if it's a short in the receiver, and in the meantime, if you do need to reach me, why don't you just go ahead and call me on my cell? Are you sure you don't want me to send Gary down there to have a look? No. No. I'm gonna see if I can handle this one by myself. All righty. Thank you kindly. Have a good day. Any games?

A what? It could be what's causing the interference. Yeah, but everyone is accounted for, right? Of course. It's just, this lady is sure she saw two kids driving a cruiser out on 110. Two kids. How old? She says under ten. (LAUGHING) Under ten. Well, Miranda, I think we can... I think we can go ahead and throw that one in the nut file, since everyone's accounted for. Oi course.

Hush. Hush. I said, "Hush." Hey. Hey. (DOGS PANTING) (WHIMPERING) All right, kids. Fun's over. I know who you are. And you are in a whole hell of a lot of trouble. Do you understand? It's downright stupid to steal a police car, but you've done it. And what's done is done. What we're looking at is a felony offense. A felony offense. And what that means is guaranteed jail time. The only thing that can help you now is if that car is returned to me in one piece. And what that means is you ski}! Have a chance to work something out, I! You tell me right now where you are. Do you understand? Keep going. A little further. Oh, perfect, right there. On three. One! Two! Aim for the vest. Two and a half! Two and three quarters! Now! (GUN CLICKING) Ah, shit. Maybe it's out of bullets. I think the trigger's stuck. Where's the little gun? Uh... I don't know. I'll go get some more bullets. Okay. What do you think this does? Uh... I don't know. (DEFIBRILLATOR POWERING UP) SHERIFF KRETZER: (OVER RADIO) Once again, to the two children who have stolen my vehicle. This does not have to be a felony offense. Heck, it doesn't even have to be a misdemeanor. What's impatient is that the car gets returned to me, immediately. (PANTING) What? If you do not know how to use the radio, it's easy. You just pick up the mic, and you hold down the little black button and you can talk, and when you're through, you let go and I can talk. And no one else can hear. This doesn't have to be... I just want my car back. We should get out of here. Yeah, I'll go get the stuff. No! What? I mean leave the car. What? Why? 'Cause we're in big trouble. We're not in trouble. You're just too scared to drive fast enough to get away from them. I drive fast! You don't drive fast. I saw you. You were only going 35, pussy. No, I'm not! I was driving as fast as you. Grandma's boy. Hey! Screw you! Don't push me! (GRUNTS) I'm gonna leave and you can go to jail when the cops get here. I'm not going to jail. Why not?

I'm a good guy. Then why are you tied up? (WHIMPERS) Um... Because I, uh... I need someone to rescue me. You boys are gonna rescue me, right? Maybe. You know who the bad guy is? The sheriff. He's a bad, bad guy. Where is he? Whoa, wait, hey. Hey, don't leave me in here! Hey! The fuck? Fuck, don't leave me! I think he's a good guy. Yeah, me too. Okay. Let's let him out. Listen up. We're gonna let you out, but you got to promise that you won't tell on us. Of course. I swear. You can't tell my grandma or his mom or any of our teachers. Or my stepdad, Chris. I won't tell him. I won't tell a soul. Ow. (GRUNTS) Fuck. Ow. (BOTH GRUNTING) This one's really tight. Yeah. I think you need to cut 'em. All right? Maybe we can shoot them off. No! No, no, no! Don't... Don't do that. All right'? Hey. Hey, come here. You know what'? I'm looking at you boys. You seem tough. You probably... You must have a knife, right? Maybe a pocket knife on you? I had one, but it got tooken away from me at school. How about you, you got a knife? Well, there must be something sharp around here. Go on and take a look. You, take a look. Yeah, there might be something sharp in here. Maybe later, we got to go. No, no, don't. Please. I need you. I need you. Look, this really hurts. And if you don't get me out, I might die. We can look. Take a look. You stay here. Hey. Y'all best friends? How old are you? (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (SOFTLY) I'm so glad to see you boys instead of that sheriff. He's a really, really bad guy. Believe me. I'm going to hook you... HARRISON: I found one! The tweezers and the toothpick are missing, but it's got the knife part. That's great. Just come here. Come here. Get to cutting. (LOW) Listen, okay? You can't have this cop car. It's our cop car. We found it, and we're not going to let you have it. Okay? Deal. Don't worry, you can have it. I don't care if I see another cop car as long as I live. In fact, I'm gonna give you boys a whole bunch of money. You like naked girls? I'm gonna get you some Playboys. And some candy. You like candy? (TOILET FLUSHING) (SHERIFF KRETZER GRUNTING) (TOILET FLUSHING) (COUGHS) (SNIFFS) (GRUNTING) HARRISON OVER RADIO: Hello? Is mere anybody there? Hello, Mr. Sheriff. My friend and I have your car, and we're real sorry. We don't want to get in trouble but we don't know how to get back. And we're real scared. We're out here all alone. Whew. (SNIFFS) Well, you boys sure had me. (LAUGHING) Okay. All right. All right, nothing to worry about now. What's important is that we get you boys home safe. Now, you didn't touch anything, did you? A lot of dangerous equipment in my car. You didn't open the trunk there, did you? HARRISON: No. Okay. That's good. (LAUGHS) That's good. Now, I want you to go ahead and sit yourselves down in the backseat. Don't touch anything. Anybody comes by, you just say, "Help is on the way." You're doing a real special job guarding the car for the sheriff, do you understand? HARRISON: Yeah. Okay. All right. Now, you say that you don't know how to get home. Do you know where you are, what street you're on? No. Well, take a look around. You see any street signs? No. All right. Okay. Well, the road that you're on, is it a dirt road? No. Good. Good. Now tell me, is it a hilly road? Huh';? Is it a hilly road or is it a flat road? Flat. Okay. All right. Now take a look around. You see any houses? Anything at all that might help me find you? I see some windmills. A windmill? Well, uh... That's great. That's great. You know what? I think I know where to find you. What's your name, son? Harrison. And you, Time partner mere, what's his name? Travis. You boys did the right thing calling me. You just sit tight, help is on the way. And don't You worry. You are not in any kind of trouble. In. (DOOR HANDLE RATTLING) Stop fidgeting, you little shit. That gun doesn't even work! (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMS) That's right. Look. Shh! He can't hear us. (WHISPERS) What's he doing? TRAVIS: I don't know. HARRISON: Maybe he's looking to go to the bathroom. I hate him. I think he's trying to hide. He sucks at hiding. HARRISON: Why does he need both guns? TRAVIS: He's a gun hog. Here he comes. (KEYS JANGLING) (ENGINE STARTS) (PANTING) Where are we going? Are we going home? Hey! This sucks. Yeah, this fucking sucks. (RATTLING) Where'd he go? He's hiding. (GUNSHOT) He's gonna shoot us! Maybe he won't. Okay. Now, the man that owns this car is gonna be here real soon. You understand? And when he gets here, I need you boys to do something for me. Okay? You can't tell him where I'm hiding. He can't even know I'm here. He's got to think I'm still in the trunk. Why? Shut up! Just do what I said, just keep quiet. 'Cause if you don't, you know what I'll have to do? Shoot us? No, I won't. What I will do is... You got a mom and dad? My grandma. You got a pet? A guinea pig- You? Snake and a dog. You live with your mom or dad? My mom and my stepdad. What I'll do is go by your house, and first I'll kill your dog. I'll take a hammer, hit him in the head until the hammer's covered in brains. And then I'll take that snake of yours, and I'll slit him open top to bottom. Then, your mom, well, she'll probably have heard that, and she'll wonder, "What's going on?" And when I see her, you know what I'll do to her? Shoot her in the face. And your stepdad, too. Make both their faces into ground beef. And you, I'll take that, what you call ii, guinea pig. And I'll throw him against the ground as hard as I can. But that probably won't kill him, and so while he's squirming around down there, down in the dirt, I'll stomp him with my boot. Crush that guinea pig of yours. And your grandma, I'll slit her throat with a big ol' knife. And she'll scream for you, "Come and help me." But no sound will come out. And you want to know why? 'Cause you can't scream with a slit throat. You understand? So, when the sheriff shows up looking for his car' what are we gonna do? Be quiet. Great. You're eating a Slim Jim now? (WHISPERS) No. Look. Next time he comes back, you should shoot him. Here he comes. Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Why didn't you shoot him? You do it. (ENGINE IDLING) (ENGINE TURNS OFF) Should we tell? (WHISPERS) What if this guy kills our families? He just wants his car back. I don't know. Fuck! Fuck! Whew. (LAUGHING) You boys sure gave me a fright. Holy hell. Whew. (SNIFFS) What do you say we get you home safe, huh? (SNIFFS) Okay, now you boys answer me now. Did you open up the trunk? Was there somebody inside the trunk? Did you open the trunk? Did you open the trunk? Did you open the trunk? Did you open the trunk? Did you open the trunk? Boy, you answer me now, or I will shoot you dead, right through this door. Tell me right now. Where is he? Son. I am the only person out here that you can trust. I am the only one that can help you. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (WHISPERS) Oh, fuck. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (TURNS STEREO OFF) I knew it! You little shit! I knew I wasn't crazy! You think you could run down this highway and I won't know about it? I know these roads like the back of my hand! What's wrong with you? Don't think you can play dumb with me. I saw you. You almost ran me off the road. You are in so much trouble! Get out of the car! Hey! I'm talking to you! Step outside the car. Come on. Get out! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

He is the father of the two boys that are inside this vehicle. You are okay. He has fled the scene, and everything is okay, but I'm gonna need your help with something. All right? Now, listen up. After I was attacked, he threw my keys on the other side of the road, way over there. And what I'm gonna need you to do is go ahead, cross the road, and see if you can find my keys for me so that I can radio for assistance. You see, I cannot walk. Do you understand? Yeah. Why don't I just call somebody to come and get you'? No. No, no. No need to call. Just head on over there and see what you can find. Go on. Go on. You okay? Yeah. Go on. Okay. Just take a good look around there. BEV: It's gonna be hard to find them out here. There's so much tumbleweed. SHERIFF KRETZER: Cover as much ground as you can. Yeah, and just keep your eyes peeled, okay? Okay? Okay! SHERIFF KRETZER: Are you the woman that reported the children driving the cruiser? Yeah. Yeah, that was me. Everyone said that I seen it wrong, but I knew I saw them. Well, you did a real good thing, ma'am. It's citizens like you that make a difference in our community. Taking an active role. BEV: I don't see anything. SHERIFF KRETZER: You didn't find anything? Nothing at all? Keep looking. Oh, my God. There's a man out there!
