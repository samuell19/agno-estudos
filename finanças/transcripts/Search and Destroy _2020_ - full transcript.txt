Lieutenant, he's leaking too bad! here's not much I can do about it here. It felt like I had been here before, so many times It's just a matter of time before they roll down. I didn't even know who they were. Everything was starting to blur together. I had fought so many battles. Faced so many adversaries. There's a haze. She told me that if I left she wouldn't take me back. So I left. Maybe that was a mistake. Where the fuck are they coming from? That's me... Lieutenant John Cutter. Rangers. We've been tasked to rescue a VIP and his family from a small terrorist cell in West Africa. What we didn't know is they were being led by the world's most notorious war criminal. Igor Rodin. Rodin headed up a multi-national terrorist organization. With militias from around the world that he could call on, anytime. American rangers cease fire, you are surrounded. Sir. We are completely surrounded. We were completely surrounded. I was having second thoughts about this mission. Some things just didn't add up. Sir, what the fuck are we going to do? Return fire on these assholes. Keep it tight. Conserve your ammo. Debo, get in command on the line. And Kees, Sir, intel says this used to be a mining camp. There's tunnels leading out here... you find me an exit and you do it fast! Copy. Lieutenant, I've got Colonel Anderson for you. Colonel. I thought everything was under control. Now what the hell happened? What's happened? I'll tell you what fucking happened... your intel was for shit. There's a full rebel brigade out there, mechanized. Cutter, calm down. I'll calm down once you give me my QRF. I need air support. These bastards have armor. We're gonna die aren't we? Adam! No, sir you will not. Seven minutes. Copy that. Give them our coordinates. Roger control, friendlies on the ground and heavy assault, proceeding with new co-ordinates. Carter get the family to the next room we're leaving. Fire! No! Motherfuckers! They must have called for support. Keyes, you find me that back door. I can't find shit! Keep it frosty Keyes, sweep the other rooms. Sir, I think I found something. Keyes! Fuck, Joe, how you doing man? Oh shit. Okay. Slow, slow, slow. I'll go check on the guys. Suck it up. We've got to get the fuck out of here. Come on man. D-bo! John. How many guys? They're gone. Harris? Pendulum. This is Castle, we're making our in. Mark your position. Dangerous close, ready one, drop on our position. I repeat dangerous close drop on our position. All right pendulum it's your ass, cover up. Come on. I got you. Alright boy let's go. Up. Rest up. You're going to need your strength today. You little son of a gun. Been a while Lieutenant. Yes, sir. Congratulations on the promotion, General. And how's the guide business? You looking to do some hunting? I am. The season starts in October. Terrorists are always in season. I'm out, General. This is something different. Well, I was discharged. You're going on a private contract. We do it all the time. You're qualified. You're in good shape. General, I'm no good. I failed. I left my team behind. John they were dead. Africa was a rough gig. You think we sent the Rangers in because it was easy? We teach you guys everything except how to fail. My God, you'd think we'd have figured that out by now. John, it wasn't your fault. Then whose fault was it? Those men were my responsibility. Listen John. Joey's still alive because of you. The truth is I need you for this. Your country needs you. You're a good soldier General. But a shitty salesman. Okay. Igor Rodin. He's the target. Igor Rodin is dead. - Intel said the air s- - Intel was wrong. - He was shot there - John please. I need you to ID him. Shitty salesman, huh? Some things sell themselves. Thanks for being here. Lets go meet the guys. Gentlemen. Sir. General! This is Mr. Cutter civilian contractor, background airborne, ex-officer in the rangers. Mr. cutter has met our target and will ID him for us. Chief take us through the rest of y'all. All right, guys, listen up. This is a direct action operation 'Capture or kill the target'. We go in his legion one. We're about 20 nautical miles off shore. 2,100, hit that water, swim the rest of the way. Mr. Cutter, you are scuba certified I assume. Six weeks at NDSTC. Good enough. This ain't no dip in the pool. These Albanians are paranoid as shit. Activity around the port will be extremely high. At least a dozen soldiers and a few boats patrolling in the water. Who's the target? Igor Rodin. Interpol has a file on him, 10 pages long. But he now seems to be upping his game. We tracked him buying up toxic waste, from a base, here in Eastern Europe. Munitions dump. He's gotten hold of 300,000 gallons of some of the worst shit known to mankind. Now the toxic barrels by themselves don't amount to much. But coupled with the right bomb a sizable chunk of this planet will be uninhabitable for the next 200 years. That's where the three scientists come in. 3 scientists went missing. Chemical engineer, physicist, mechanical engineer. By themselves not one of them was capable of making a bomb. But together. That's one hell of a lethal cocktail. We have a six hour window. If they finish the assembly, we're done. I advise you all to familiarize yourself with the details in your logs. Any questions? Gentlemen I've got to make a transmission. Alright boys, get some rest. John I'll catch you pre-mission. Yes, sir. John Cutter. Yeah. Lieutenant John Cutter. I used to be. JSOC, Africa command, three years ago. Yeah, that's me. Lost your team. Something like that. Heard you washed out. It's pretty hard to go on giving orders after that one, Chief. I bet. It was pretty rough stuff. I know FUBAR, man. I don't judge you. Where are you getting at chief? Why are you coming with us? Just stay her on the sub. We'll send you back a video after we kill Rodin. You confirm it on datalink. The General thinks I need to be there. I'm the only one that knows what Rodin looks like. We're after a bomb. This ain't a personal vendetta. Too late. I got six guys I got to get home. Copy? Yeah I copy. Good. We've got about six hours, then this thing dumps us in the Adriatic. I want you to ask yourself. Am I good to go? If you're not all in. Do us all a favor. Don't go. Nice family. Thanks man. Never easy to say goodbye, you now. I'm Marcus Cooper. Call me Coop. John Cutter. Welcome aboard John. So, you got kids? No. A wife? No. Girlfriend? Well, there's Spud. Spud? Yeah he's a Golden lab mix. Okay, man's best friend, right? As long as I'm feeding him. I'm gonna sack out. Cool man. Look Nina, I want to do this job and go home. And you know he'll kill us the minute it's finished. If you believe that, why keep working? Because any hope is better than that. Hope? I've seen hope, drive people across the desert, thousands of miles, only to die of starvation the moment they find the food. I have seen the hope drive the people, day after day to some shitty factories, until after 80 years, they simply expired, and you say hope. He needs a hospital. I need my bomb quicker. We're moving as fast as we can. You had better be. What if I start the reaction now? And blow us all to hell. Then at the very least, I would be pleasantly surprised. Do it. Don't tempt me. Do it. Nina. But what will that do, for your hope? Bye! Stay tight. We don't want make a wave signature. Rodin's underwater sensors are so sensitive, that if a shark were to take a shit, they would pick that shit up, literally. Cutter where do you say you earned your scuba cert? The local YMCA? NDSTC. Slow it down gents. These mines are hot. Shut up Cutter. I'll swim as fast as I goddamn want. Danimal, I would listen to Cutter. Whose side are you on Coop? Just keep it tight. Heard about the last time you were on a mission Cutter... you lost five fucking men. Don't talk about things you don't know about. Hey we're on a mission here. Now get your shit in line, Cutter. Cutter, don't listen to what the fuck they're saying. Bunch of dicks. Let's just keep it moving. Good one Cutter. Come on Coop. Look at me Cutter. I'm not keeping it tight. Fucking asshole. Oh my- - Oh my God - Cutter? Danimal! What the fuck? I need divers in the water now. Roger that. Let£s make this fast. I have a hot date tonight. Well, they know we're here now, gents. Double time it. Mr. Rodin, One of our underwater mines was triggered. I have deployed divers, but it may be the incursion you feared. By the time they're reporting? We may not have the time to finish the bomb. No matter. We'll finish it en route. Doctor Islef. We are moving on. Bring with you, only what you need to finish a project. What about Yuri? He is not needed anymore. Prepare yourselves to leave. The time is not on our side doctor. He was never going to recover. We both know that. Now. Go. Move. We got this boys. Remember your training. You and Mikhail go to discotheque? No, Mikhail£s on barrel duty. I'm taking Tomas. He knows how to tango. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. American scum! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! No! Cutter. You know your shit. I wished Danimal had listened to you. Why do you hate God so much, Igor? Look at the world, Niki. The innocent suffer, the guilty prosper. God made us in his image, what does it tell you about him? It means he is a motherfucker just like me. Can't this piece of shit go any faster? We can't go faster than the truck... the truck has 2000 kilos in the back. Nevermind, soon we'll be rich men. I hope it's true. Don't hope Vladimir. Hope is for peasants and priests. We are soldiers. We are making our destiny. We don't pray for it. Miguel, counterclockwise. Look. Come on, this is not a discotheque. Hurry up they're inside. Where is Vishan? He call in fever sick. I radio for replacement. Mikhail Dromislov, Reporting for replacement duty, Sir. Mikhail you're not replacing anybody. Please give me chance. Fuck this up, Barrel duty for life. Hurry up with the charges. Something doesn't look right. Hey Chief, you better come see this. Been dead nearly a half hour. Toxic waste. Yeah. These tanks must be full with whatever did that to him. Let's go. Chief! Take cover! Look at me, look at me! We need to fucking move now. And go where man? Danimal's dead, Ross is dead and Chief's a fucking meatball. We just missed the target so we fucked that deal. We just pissed off the entire fucking Albanian army. Thought you Seals were tough. I don't have many breathes left... don't make me waste 'em running you down. You stow your weapon and sharpen up. Let me hear you say "Aye, aye, Master Chief". Aye aye Master Chief. Now listen up. Cutter's going to get you home. You take orders from him from now on. He's a fucking sin. He's an officer. You ain't qualified to make a tougher choice than ''paper or plastic''. and that's an order. Let me hear it! - Aye aye Master Chief - Aye aye Master Chief You guys are a great team. I hate to bitch out at you like this. You just worry about finding a way out of here. Find us a truck moving out. Go, Come on. See you downrange. See you there, Rookie. What the hell are you doing? You get my boys home. I don't exactly have the best track record. You better. Or I will haunt your ass. Tier 1 poltergeist shit, you copy? Yeah, copy. They knew we were coming here. Just something ain't right. What do you think we should do Chief? Call the General, tell him you're coming back. Roger that. Give me that frag, will you? Good luck, Cutter. Chief? Drive. Welcome, gentlemen. To hell! Sir, we have Legion 1 on the sat link. Chief Ryan? No, Sir. Cutter. John? General. Where's Chief Ryan? He's gone. So is Dan and Russ. And Rodin? Negative. Looks like they blew out of there before we arrived. We need an exfil- We had a UAV up over their base and tracked three vehicles leaving 10 minutes ago. One of them was kicking out enough neutrons to light up like an electric lightbulb. Assume Rodin is with the bomb you'll be heading for Nagorna Stasi. It's an army base about 10 miles to your west. Sir we need a way out. You and the remaining members of your team are all we have there. General these men are tired. They lost their leader, friends, we're low on ammo. God dammit John, when that bomb's gone, it's gone. Imagine the role of that truck in Paris, Berlin or Moscow and set it off. I don't know what you're going to have to go to find it. But you've got to dig deep and find whatever it is you've lost and finish this. Otherwise two good men died for nothing and hell of a lot more will follow. John? I know what Chief would say. I promised to get you guys home. Some promises no-one can keep. We're Seals, John. We finish the fucking mission, no matter what. John, are you there? Send us the data, you have. We'll stop this bastard for you Sir. Is that our truck? Won't know until we look inside. So what's the plan? We do it loud. There's only five of us. Yeah, they don't know that. We hit 'em so hard and so fast they'll think there's whole motherfucking division out here. You know, I like this guy. To think I almost stabbed him a few hours ago. He almost kicked your ass a few hours ago. Can the grab ass. All right. Pinky, Nick... I want you guys on Alpha team. Take a look inside the truck. Coop, you're on Bravo, all by your lonesome. I want you on the long gun. When the shit hits fan secure the truck, we move out. Frank, you're with me on Charlie team We'll hit the main building we'll do a quick intel sweep. Good to go? Yeah, let's go. Lock and load. The convoy. Where did they go?! I don't know. Okay, okay! They never stop here. They went straight to Golyama. What's this? Train station. Run! Argh! John, get in! Pinky! You good to drive? Yeah! Stay on this road, I know where they're going. How? Golyama train station. Five miles north of here. Call it in. Fuck. You're one lucky bastard, you know that? Careful, careful... yes. You have one hour to finish the bomb. What guarantee do you have the you will not shoot us like you did Yuri? None. Just my word. I gain nothing by your death. The Americans already know I have the weapon. Now it's just a game of time. One hour. What other choice do we have? Let's work. Stop! Oh! Where are you going? Coop, I want you and the others take this road southwest. You'll run into a small fishing village. Steal a boat, you'll be in Italian waters by nightfall. You're gonna take on those guys on your own? Just one. We're coming with you. Pink, you're good. But one arm... you ain't no good to me. I can still put out. Who's gonna get Nick home if Pink's only got one good arm? That's an order. Hey man, if I can't stop him someone has to let General Anderson know the bomb is on that train. 12 hours from now that train could be in the heart of Europe... Germany, Austria, Russia. Letting that train go free is like putting a virus directly in the bloodstream of the continent. Anderson will know what to do. Go. Good luck. Hey Coop? Yeah? If I fuck this up, I want you to go to NOLA for me. There's a joint there, it's called The Coach and Horses. There's a bartender. Can't miss her. eyes even one of you frogmen could drown in. She's got Spud. Her name's Jenna. Listen, man, you'll be taking care of that yourself. And if I can't...? We've been thinking getting a dog ourselves. He'll have a good home. Where have you been? Looking at the train. You're lucky you didn't miss it. Papa, there's lots of soldiers on this train and they have guns. Right. Now... sit down. We have a long trip. Get ready to move. Where to? North. No way, we are not clear to go north. Are we clear now? Go. Papa, papa, we're moving. He has a gun. Son, you need to be quiet. Ha-ha, nice try. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome on board train 290 with non-stop service to hell. For the duration of our travel I will be a host. My name is none of your business. And in case of an emergency... all of you will probably die. Please, sir. We are peaceful people. We are... You serve a single function... All of you will act like shields to protect me. Your lives mean as little to me as that of insects. If you wish to get off of this train, you will be a obedient. You will be silent! Believe in me as father here believes in God. You can survive with this, and now... The choice is yours. Clean this up, will you? It's a bit early to celebrate, isn't it? I'm drinking champagne for pleasure. Not for some special occasions. Jamal! It's your friend, Igor. Yes, we are on the way I received the deposit and now you need to escrow the remainder of the fee with our friends from Switzerland. Of course the device is ready! It will perform precisely as demonstrated. If not, keep away your one hundred million. Bye. Zivko! I want to know the second the money hits the escrow account. Nikola... for Christ's sakes. What is wrong? There is a long way to go in here playing romantic-man with this girl. There are no more moves. No more decisions to make. If we have made our plans well, then we will succeed. If no, we will fail... and nothing can change that now. Nina! Check if the solenoid on 14 is connected. It's fine. No, it's not. I'm not getting the signal. Gregor, it is connected. Come see for yourself. I'm disconnecting the container from the pressure valves to the fuel. But that will disable the bomb. Precisely. He will kill us. He's going to do that anyway. I won't let him get away with this. Nina, please. Don't do this. I have a family... - Back to work! - He's going to... Guard! Stop her! Coward. Hey! Oh! Hold on... Hold on, I got my ticket, alright? It's... Call me Igor, please. What?! Explain. She has disconnected the firing circuits to the valve-solenoids What does it mean? Sabotage. Can you fix it? I believe so. Asshole. You believe? For one million dollars, I could be certain. One? Da, one. One million dollars in a Swiss account with a name on it. Can be done. How long do you need? Forty-five minutes, no more. Go. Get it right. Nikola, go with him and protect him, like he is your son. Okay. Sir, I'm in. I'm gonna shut down the system. Make any sound and I will end your life. You speak English? I do. Who are you? I'm asking the questions. What are you doing here? I'm the conductor. Veselin. How many of them are on board? Thank God you're not with them. How many? Hm, they're around twenty of them. I'm not sure what is happening in the two front carriages. They won't let me in. I need a phone. Cell phones don't work here. Not for the next 300 kilometers. What about for emergencies? You can use mine. But it's connected only to the dispatcher's office. Then put me on it. Control. Who's this? This is control agent Boris Tamesh 4, 3, 7, 9, 4... Hey! Who the hell is this? John Cutter. I'm on train to 290. I need you to contact NATO headquarters in Brussels, have them connect you to U.S. army and then to Italy. Authorization code is: Kilo... Tango... Charlie... 9... 7... Are you fucking deaf? No, I'm looking for the correct regulation and according authorisation use of the phone system... No regulations for a bomb. Boris, do as he says. Bandits took over my train. Veselin, is that you? This person should not use our phone. Hey, listen asshole. There's a bomb the size of a fucking minivan on this train. Tell me again, what was your name, please? Tennant John Cutter. Ask for General Norman Anderson. And you want me to call NATO? Da. Are you going to do it or what? Yes, I will. But first, I have to find... Line went dead. Not good. Someone heard us. Is there another phone? Yes... in my office. Get back there before they notice you're gone. Yes, please connect me with NATO headquarter in Brussels. It is an emergency call. Mister? Woah, hey. Is there truly a bomb on this train? I think so. How did you know about that? I heard the big ugly man talking about a bomb. Too many of those ugly big men on this train? Mister, are you one of the bad guys? No, kid. Do I look like a bad guy? Here... Is this for me? This drawing is for you. That's where the soldiers are, and the barrels. That's the one the big man and his friends are in. Here I don't know... some kind of yellow barrel. Thank you. Mr. Rodin Sir, we have a problem with one of the passengers. American or English, I can't tell. You're going to fail. On the line to the main office he told them about the bomb. Bastard. I disconnected the line, sir, but... Watch her! Follow me. Doctor, if you want to live, to see that money, finish the damn bomb! Control. Boris, did you make the call? Yes, I made. And? And they told me to please wait and they'll call back to verify. Did you tell them about the bomb? I did. And? And they will call me back... Boris, you need to yell and scream until they hear you. A lot of people are going to die unless that message gets through. Do you understand? How can I help you? American. Where is he? No, sir... no American here. You let him use the phone. No one here. He was a foreign provocateur, you fool. Give me the PA. American! I was listening. You will surrender yourself to me at once. If not, I will start killing passengers. One at a time. Each fucking minute. Until you do. You're the scientist. You're the American? I suppose so. They're looking for you. They want to kill you. You cannot surrender. You are all we have. It's okay. I have no plans of giving up. Good. You don't have much time. It's long finished. So? How long do I have? Maybe 15 minutes. Drop it, or the kid dies. Who are you? Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa? Nikola! Let me see what we have here. Who is he? He said he's Mother Teresa. What an idiot. I know him. It's always nice to know you're remembered. Your pride cost me too much money that day. Your greed cost me the lives of my troopers. He is an American. American? Lieutenant... John Cutter, right? We met in Africa. How did the CIA find me? Maybe the yellow pages? That was a total lie. What are you doing here? I'm here to ID you and your fucking bomb for a strike team. You're bluffing. Try me. I already planted the GPS. Yeah, you're right. I'm going to kill you right now. Kill me asshole. I'm the only one who knows where it is. Come to think of it. The birds are already on their way. Rodin, you need to see this. Hold on. I will be there in a minute. Nikola, make him talk. Yes, yes! Come on, come on. This is Legion One... unsecured in an emergency frequency... for any U.S Military forces in range, over. Legion One, this a submarine. Listen, I need General Anderson, fast! Sir, this is a non-secure frequency Put it on your report, go for Anderson. General, this is Coop. The device and the target on the train 290 out of Golyama. 1400 hours today, destination... unknown. Train 290, out of Golyama, 1400, copy. I have one critically wounded sailor and one with a GSW non-critical. I need emergency pickup. Where's Cutter? Cutter's on the train, sir. He wanted to finish the mission. We're coming to get you, Cooper. Hang tight. Get me NATO, I need an immediate strike readied. We need two interceptors for train 290. But, sir, Cutter's still on board... And so is that bomb. Switch our tracks over in the next intersection. Sir, that's extremely dangerous. We just shut down the entire system... it's a single track of railroad. Coming the other way could be 10,000 tons of steel. Exactly. Or, 1,000 pounds of high explosive courtesy of the United States Air Force. One is a maybe. The other... indefinitely. Hello? Train number 70? Hello?! Hello? Train number 70? Where is the GPS? Tell us! Tell us you American piece of shit. You tell us! Why did I leave her? She said I cared more about my unit. She said I would give my last breath. She was right! What the hell is happening? I don't know sir. The truck was diverted to an outside command and then the system crashed. Can't contact them? Negative sir. I tried, but it is an old train and no one answers. What about 2-9-0? I don't know. They don't receive, I think the signal is cut. Call the army, see if someone can get a helicopter with a loudspeaker there. Sir, I don't think it's a good idea, because there is a bomb on the train. Don't argue with me, you imbecile. Do it! Sir? Bullets hit the pipes. We need to slow down. Slow down for nothing. Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your Light and Saviour. Fuck off! What is troubling your soul my son? You need to clear your conscience. Get back to your seat. I want to bring your lost soul to Jesus. I'll fucking kill you. And I will rise from the dead. Repent sinners. You're going to get a medal. Yes, if I leave. I need a phone. John, is this you? For God's sake, stop the train. Yeah, I'd love to pall, no dice. Jesus! Did you reach General Anderson? Not yet. John you are on a collision course with another train. How long do we have? About eight minutes! I need you to contact General Anderson through the codes I gave you. Tell him the bomb is on this train. Do you understand? We're on a collision course with another train. I need to disconnect the cars. How do we do it? I can show you how to do it. Good. First I have some unfinished business. No, no, no! No shooting! Drop it! Please, no shooting! One ricochet and we will die. Please. No shooting. Please! Okay. This is General Anderson. It's for you. NATO headquarters. It's about time. Sir, yes sir. Boris, this is General Anderson. Yes, Captain Tamesh, sir. I have a message for you from John Cutter. The bomb and the target are on the train. I know that captain. The question is, where is the train? The train diverted west. It's approximately 10 km from border with Monte Negro. Approximately? Our command control sir, is malfunctioning. Jesus! And sir, another thing. Very important. The train 2-9-0 is on a collision course with another train, Steam train from Croatia. Thank you Captain. Find me that goddamn train. Hey! Sorry I didn't make an appointment. What the hell is it with you? A personal crusade to stop me making any money? Maybe you should find a new profession. Murder and kidnapping don't seem to be working out too well. It's easy for you to say. You're a young man. You know how hard it is to change careers in middle age. Tell me. What do you want from me? I want you to die. Listen! Once the bomb is delivered, I make one hundred million dollars. Just name your price. Half and half. That's a fuck load of money. Are you offering me a partnership? Oh no man. I already have partners. You know them. It's uncle Sam, CIA, Roland E. Anderson, E. stands for Elliot. What are you talking about? Lieutenant, we are working for the same people, the only difference is, I am making much more money. Hold on! I think we got a little stand-off here. No one has to die. One month ago, I had a contract with CIA. They highjacked the scientist, But later some whistleblower opened his mouth and now the US government wants to shut me down forever. I need an insurance policy. The bomb. No one will fuck me up when this toy is ready. US government doesn't deal with terrorist. Come on man. All the criminals and terrorists all over the world, have had a business with the CIA. On Monday they need us, on Tuesday they train us, On Wednesday they use us, by Friday we are terrorists again. We are all from the same school! I don't care! He's using us both. We still can make a deal. Here's the deal. You die. I came here to make the world safer, but now I£m here for... Frank! Russ, Dan, and Joe! All units, take positions. Welcome home Cooper. You heard from Mr. Cutter sir? Not yet. I hope he makes it. It looks like there's going to be a collision with the other train and I don't think there's a damn think we can do about it. We have to do something. I'm trying son. That man saved our asses back there. So with all due respect, try harder. Stand down sailor. Can you disarm the bomb? No, not if Gregor finished it. Focus on the bomb Nina. Gregor has installed three triggers. The timer, remote detonator, accelerator. What's that? If the bomb is moved too fast, Like if the trains crashes? We are all going to die if we crash. We all die if I tamper the device, or interrupt the circuits. Unless... Unless? I can depressurise the oxygen tanks, that will slow down the main , and if I'm right, it will help switch off the entire system. There won't be a bomb anymore. Exactly! What are you waiting for? I never did it before. Jesus... I can try, but if I fail, millions will die. We don't have a choice. Good luck Nina. Be cool. Be outta here in a few minutes. Okay, I will start draining the fuel tanks. Warning! Three minutes to collision! Three minutes to collision! Damn it, what the hell?! Get me some leverage! Warning! You are two minutes from collision! You are two One minute to collision! One minute to collision! Warning! Thirty seconds to collision! Thirty seconds to collision! I knew you could do it. Hi ma'am. Hi. I am a friend of John Cutter. Really? John Cutter? He told me to come here and find Jenna. Said you might have a dog of his in your home. Can't have my dog Coop! John! Jesus Christ man, I thought you were dead! That was the idea. Good to see you bud! Yeah, man. Hey baby! Hi! Heard Nick and Pink both made it. They did. Thanks for coming up Coop. It means a lot. You did pretty good for a ground hunter. I'd go to war with you anytime. How is General Anderson? You know, he's a big hero now. Probably gonna run for presidency. I don't think he will. What you got there? You know, broken promises, lies, murder. Jenna? Any chance two thirsty men can get a couple? My girl! To all our fallen brothers.
