You need help? They're the winds of Lent. You're going to Matanzas in this lemon? Hey, don't call my Chevy a lemon. What's in Matanzas? I'm inspecting a fertilizer factory. I'm an engineer. And I'm glad you showed up, because I'm a lousy mechanic. When are you coming back? It depends on the job. What are you, a cop? I must be going blind if I've never seen you before. You live around here? Yes. Well, no. My mom lives here. I'm separated and only just came back. Separated? Let me go, you bastard! There, on the corner. Well, I'm totally divorced. No commitments. No car, no dog... Well, I have afighterfish named Rufino. I have tons of books and plenty of friends. Particularly one who lives near your mom. And yes. Actually. I'm a cop. WINDS OF HAVANA What happened, Fabricio? Conde! Get over here. I see Fabricio is still an asshole. Here. A high school teacher at La Vibora. She was killed last night. La Vibora High School? She was strangled right here in her apartment. First they beat her up. It looks like to rape her. Go on, get moving. And listen closely to what I'm about to say, Conde. I don't want any complaining. No drinking and no bullshit. Go on. This fucking sucks. I don't know why they assigned me this case. I hate rape cases. Who the hell likes them, Manolo? You finally showed up. You guys can't live without me? What did you find? This clean little envelope with methamphetamine in a very dirty place. Come on, Manolo. I want to finish quickly. They found a used condom in the bathroom. And marijuana in the ashtray. Good start. Sex, drugs, violence... The bed smelled like rum. The girl's name was Lissette Nflfiez Delgado. It doesn't look like she was problematic. On the contrary. She joined student organizations and youth groups. What else? In the kitchen, two empty bottles of rum and four glasses. And it was all clean. She could have washed the glasses. But the bottles? Right. They tried to wipe the prints. They botched the job. Very nice furniture. I made it myself. Yeah, but these aren't the best. I made furniture for millionaires. God knows where it ended up after they fled. If it's good, someone has it. - So don't worry. - No, no. My biggest worry at my age is peeing right. Juan, you said you heard music and noise upstairs last night, is that right? Did you see anyone go up? Well, yes. I was taking out the trash. I take out the trash at night. And there was a kid in front of me who looked familiar. But since it was dark on the stairs, I couldn't see him. But I know from the smell he was carrying pizzas. Did you see any of the people who visited Lissette? I'll tell you one thing. A few days ago I saw an older man. He could have been family. Can you identify him? Or the kid last night? I don't trust my vision anymore. I haven't been in here for a thousand years. It feels like another lifetime. Don't tell me you're scared of the principal's office. It doesn't exactly bring back good memories. Everyone has their own trauma. That's why you're going to see the principal and I'm going to take a look around. You always give me the hardest job. Okay. The truth is, when Lissette started working here, I had a problem with it. Why? Because she seemed too immature. The way she treated the students... You know what it's like to run a high school? It's not easy facing a classroom full of 15 and 16-year-olds. They don't care about anything. Only Adidas, sex, screwing around... Do you know if Lissette took drugs? Drugs? - No. Look, officer. We're talking about a serious person. You can be sure of that. What about her private life? Lissette was a modem young woman. She had a fight with Pupi, her boyfriend, a couple months ago. But he was still into her. So I wasn't surprised to see him here on his motorcycle two days ago. Two days ago? Are you sure? I saw them ride away together. Keep smoking, I'm not a teacher. I came to smoke too. Want one? No, thank you. Were any of you in Lissette's class? I'm a police officer. As you can imagine, I'm investigating her death. It looks like nobody was in her class. You weren't in her class either? Yes. Is it true she was killed? What was she like? As a teacher, I mean. Is this an interrogation? No. This is just a conversation in a high school bathroom. I used to smoke in here too. Like you do now. Some things never change. What's your name? Me? Jose Luis. Jose Luis Ferrer. Where were you, man? We have to find a guy named Pupi on Santos Suerez. He was Lissette's boyfriend and they were seen riding away together the day before she was killed. Pupi from Santos Suerez? What happened here? Stop here for a second, Manolo. - I'll kick your ass, you bastard! - Hey, what did he do? What do you care? Are you family? - Let me go, damn it! - Oh, Lieutenant. Calm down! He almost killed that other guy. We'll take him with us. We've been looking for him. - But Lieutenant... - It's okay. Leave him to me. We've been following this case. Take the other guy to the hospital. Let me go! Faggot! Damn it, Red! We're a thousand years old and the same bullshit? Stay there. Candito, do you know a guy named Pupi who rides one of those motorcycles brought in years ago from Germany? I hear he lives nearby. Never heard of him. A teacher at our high school was killed. No shit. Ayoung girl. Apparently this guy was with her. Well, I don't know any Pupi. But I know a group of guys who race motorcycles down that old road where we used to play ball, remember? And drugs? Do you know if they sell any of that shit? I don't know. But probably. They found marijuana and methamphetamines in her apartment. Take these off, bro. Candito, I need you to help me out. I can't stand the idea of those bastards selling drugs in our high school. Conde, do you know what you're asking me to do? I'm not a snitch. Damn it, Red. She was raped, strangled and beat up. All I'm asking is for you to keep your ears open. All right. Take off his cuffs and take him home. I'll meet you at the station. Why do I have to do everything? The captain gives orders... Hey, lieutenant and you're crazy. Hello. Are you lost or what? I need to see the Gardener. Tell him Red wants to see him. I'll be right back. Talk to my mother, she likes it. Jose, this is the best ajiaco we've ever tasted. Really? You see? Don't worry about doing the dishes, we'll take care of it. Yes, but be careful with the plates. I know you guys. I'll help you. Jose! Do you know a redhead named Karina who lives nearby? Karina'? Doesn't ring a bell. That's weird. Everyone knows everyone around here. Gardener, you know I had to change businesses because... Yeah. You don't bring me beef anymore. Business was really bad. Now I'm making sandals for women, but things are really fucking shitty. Maybe I could sell to you wholesale. I'll give you a special price. Is that why you came to see me? - You want in the business? - No way. - Well then? - You know it's not my thing. I'm grateful, but it's not my thing. But since you brought it up, I have to talk to you. But... in private. Spit it out. Look, man. I know you know more about this than me. But I want to tell you something. Watch out for your competition. I heard they're selling drugs at La Wbora High School. And if that's true, it can be bad for you. Look, Red. That's not my problem. I don't work the schools. That's a taboo here, you know that. That's what I thought. It seemed odd to me. But if someone is... You know. It could screw you over. Red, thanks for the heads up. - I don't like that rat. - It's okay. I've known him my whole life. He's clean. He's a good guy. He's fighting. Well, if you say so. Listen closely, Tony. You always screw up. Find out if the new kid, the one from La Wbora High School, is cutting my material and selling it at the school. No, hold on. I warned that kid not to sell at the school, Gardener. - And he's not stupid. - Exactly. He might be fucking us over. I don't know why the drugs surprise you. He's a cop in Cuba, damn it! Yeah, but methamphetamine. In our day there wasn't even marijuana. - \Nhat? Okay, there was. But we weren't into that stuff. Whatever. It was another time. Maybe we were more romantic, I don't know. But they were hard on us. What about the hippies? For having long hair and talking about free love they made them serve in the military or plant sweet potatoes. And when we got caught listening to American music, what were we accused of? - Ideological... subversion. Yeah, but it was for our own good. So we would have a better future, damn it. - A bright future. - Yeah. Very bright. A bright future that lasted 8 hours and an 8-hour blackout. You know what my philosophy professor at university used to say? He said it over and over again. That we were a lost generation. What we were is a fucked up generation. What the fuck. Andresito, stop, brother. It wasn't like that. You wanted to study medicine. And you became a doctor. And a very good one, by the way. Okay, you couldn't play baseball after that, but that was - bad luck. - Skinny, that's bullshit. There was always something we were supposed to do or some asshole telling us what to do. Don't bullshit me. He's worse than me. Just let me listen to these animals. I love these bastards. Don't play dumb, you know you wanted to be a writer and you ended up being a cop. Andres, buddy, give it a rest. You're drunk. Drunk my ass, damn it. Drunk my ass. Look at yourself, Skinny. You joined a war that wasn't yours and look what it got you. You think that doesn't hurt me? Well? What fol'? Because they said we would be better off. And now what the fuck are we, gentlemen? What the fuck are we? I don't remember who said it, but... Something is rotten in Denmark. Hey, have you told these two delinquents that you're in love and you've started writing again? No. Damn! Of course, that's why you looked weird to me. Good lord! We're in big trouble. This is the time you get here? Have you bought a mirror to see your face in the morning? Take a look. How's the case going? Slowly. I asked you to make it fast. - Yeah, but it's going slowly. - Then put both feet on the gas, Conde. Maruchi, bring some coffee. The good stuff. Listen closely to what I'm going to say. And this stays between us. Something big is going down. And it's coming from high up. An internal investigation. And they're after somebody's neck. Police investigating police. What the hell is going on? I don't know. But it can't be good. So get to work. And behave yourself, damn it. Go on. Lissette had a lot of alcohol in her blood. I can't confinn if she consumed any marijuana. But she did consume methamphetamine. Maybe they drugged her to rape her. It looks like there was no rape. But they said... There was confusion because she was beaten up. And she did have sexual relations before her death. But nothing indicates forced penetration. And most importantly, the semen we found in her vagina doesn't match the sample from the condom found at the scene. You mean she was with two men? At least two. The semen from the condom belongs to an older man with blood type A. The vagina, a younger man, Wm ma. The rest is in the report. Look. Tell me what you think. Total crap. They're useless. What about Pupi? I can't find him. But I found about when they hold those races. I also heard Pupi buys and sells motorcycles and anything else he can get his hands on. Damn! I'll put you up for Fastest Police Officer. And I'll tell the major to give you the case so I can retire from this shit and fucking go home already. Look, take care of Pupi personally. And call me with any news. - Okay? - Fine. See you later. Julio! Do me a favor, give this to Roberto. Give me good news, Cicerbn. Did you find out what I asked? Yes. The tests indicate that the marijuana in the girl's apartment is either Mexican or Nicaraguan. They caught two guys last month with packages and it looks like the same stuff. - And the meth? - We get all kinds of stuff. But don't worry. If anything turns up, I'll have Lieutenant Fabricio inform you. Fabricio? - He's working with you? - Yeah. Is there a problem? I don't have one. But he seems to have a problem with me. Conde, don't tell me you two still haven't buried the hatchet. Forget him. Move on. And quit clicking that pen, you're driving me nuts. Looking for something? Is Candito around? - Candito! - What! Someone here for you. I'll be right down. Conde, damn! CuquL Make some coffee. Red, she's looks like too much for you. Why do you think I work my ass off? Stop making up new businesses... - What businesses? - I won't always be there to save your ass when things get hot. Money. ma? We're out of coffee. We're out? Go over to Petronila's house and buy two packs. And cover your tits. You'll give Conde a heart attack. So I heard you're in love again. Skinny has a big fucking mouth. - Does he? I know you. - What have you got? Did you find out anything? Conde, I'm dealing with people who don't even believe in their mothers. Red, you might think I'm using you, that I don't give a shit about you. And I might be an asshole for getting you involved. But they killed this girl, and I just can't... Just forget it. Hold on, hold on. I've got something for you. The guy who runs the drugs around here has nothing to do with the high school. So look somewhere else. You got it? Honey, not even charities have coffee around here. Damn, there's no coffee in this country. Red, that girl is definitely too much for you. Damn! You have incredibly bad luck. Hanging out with my friends isn't a crime. No, but gambling and racing motorcycles are. But don't worry, we'll talk about that another time. Right now we need to find Pupi. From Santos Suerez. So talk. I only know Pupi from buying spare parts from him. What a coincidence. That's exactly why we're looking for him. You're going to Mamnzas in this lemon? Hey, don't call my Chevy a lemon. When are you coming hack? It depends on the job. Two or three days. You five around here? Yes. Well, nu. My mom {was here. I'm separated and only just came hack. Separated? I'm totally divorced. And yes. I'm a cop. You're lying to me. You're actually a writer. I wish. But if I were, I'd want to be like him. That bastard Salinger. I've never read him. Do you like jazz? Jazz? I can't live without jazz. I love it. My dad used to take me to his friends' gigs. He was never a star, but he played with guys from the old school. I'll make you a deal. I'll loan you Salinger and you give it back or I'll arrest you. And when you get back from Matanzas, take me to hear some jazz. Karina. It's me, Conde. I have to fine you 25 pesos, you know. Are you a cop 24 hours a day or do you ever rest? I rest. I even take a vacation. I'm thinking of retiring. How's your police work going? Complicated. Did you make it to Matanzas? Do you like the band? I like the classics better. So you're a conservative. - No. - Yeah. What I am is a sentimental jerk. That's why I like this place. The Bohemian atmosphere. It makes me imagine the Havana I never knew. Marion Brando watching Chori in the beach bars, Nat King Cole at the Tropicana, the bars by the port where the old guys say you could spend hours listening to boleros on a gramophone. Hemingway at the Floridita, Errol Flynn at Sloppy Joe's... How decadent. Yeah. Havana was so decadent it went to shit. L.D. and vehicle registration. Of course. What's up, Tony? What's up? You got material? Oh, Yosvani". What did I tell you? About what? What did I say about selling marijuana to the high school kids? What's wrong, Tony? Tell me what I said. Come here, kid. Come here. You know I'm the man here in Havana and I'll toss you in a second. Tony, I'm going to fall. You think the Gardener is fucking stupid? I don't know what you're talking about. Then you think I'm the one who's fucking stupid. You're a strange guy. I don't know. It's like you go around apologizing for being alive. I don't understand how you can be a cop. Don't worry, my boss doesn't either. And I understand even less. You know what my problem is? I almost always do what I don't want to do. I hardly ever do what I want to. For example? For example. What happened down there? Okay, Puvi- Start talking. Buying and selling appliances illegally, clothes, motorcycle pans... I have an idea. We'll search your garage. Maybe we'll find some drugs. What? No way. I'm not into drugs. But you like beating up women, is that it? If I may, Manolo. Tell me one thing, Pupi. If business is good, why complicate things with Lissette? My did you kill her? Lissette? Why would I kill Lissette? When was the last time you saw her? Tuesday. No, Monday. I picked her up after school because she wanted to buy sneakers. And what happened after? Nothing. I took her home, she tried on her sneakers and I left. And you banged her? The bitch knew I still liked her. So she still used me sometimes. But it was worth it. She was amazing in bed. So you beat her up? Listen to me, Pupi. Lissette had sex a few hours before she died. And from the semen found in her vagina, we know it was someone with type AB. Just like you. Coincidence. No way, man. Knowing Lissette, I always used a condom. I'm not going to pay for something I didn't do. Lieutenant Fabricio. Look. There was a prize at the pigeon loft. Tony. You screwed up big time. Gardener, it was an accident. I don't care what it was. I care how it happened. The police are investigating. Business will get bad. Yeah, but the police won't know it was us. No. Not us, Tony. You. Tell me one thing, Pupi. Do you know if Lissette had other relations? Think hard. We want to help you, but you have to collaborate. Yes. Him. But he was a total chump. He was crazy about Lissette, she was tooling him. It doesn't look like him. But it must be him. Who, Pupi? This must be a mistake. Sit down. And don't tell me how hard it is to run a high school. Sit down. Your fingerprints are all over the apartment. Are you going to deny you had relations with Lissette? But I didn't kill her. Why would I? I was in love with her. I was too scared to say it before. I'm scared you'll think it was me. And why would we think that? I don't know. Lissette drove me crazy. When you found out she was sleeping around you got jealous. No, sir. Please, understand me. I didn't hurt her. Look. Tell us when you saw her last. At her apartment, the day she was killed. I was there until 7:30. Then I got home at 8:30, when the news was ending. And you always used a condom. Always. Besides, I knew she was a little... And you knew she took drugs? No. Lissette didn't take drugs. If she was drugged, she was forced. Well then? Have you checked the other guy's alibi? What was his name? Pedro Ordbfiez Martell. Pupi. The guy looks guilty of everything but killing Lissette. And he was racing motorcycles that night. Then it was the principal. The condom they found was his. But his wife swears he got home long before the murder. Now I'm... lost, old man. I need to know if anyone's selling drugs at school. What? I swear I have no idea. But you do know who Lissette hung out with. I don't meddle in people's lives. Come on, Jose Luis! We're Cuban, we love gossip. Jose Luis, help me. We're talking about a teacher getting murdered. Do you recognize this kid? No. This is delicious, Jose. You saved my life. I don't know how you can live like that. Sweetie, I need you to do me a favor. I need to find out about Karina. The ghost girlfriend? Pretty much. I need to know if she went to Matanzas. You think you can ask around? Is something wrong? Nothing. Police obsession. You did the dance, huh? Okay, we danced. But she got away. You're kidding. She said she needed time, that we need to get to know each other. This late in the game? You know what? You're my pal. I don't like talking about it. But sometimes... I still think about the war. And... I see myself back in Angola, stuck in that hole in the ground... I don't know what the hell I was doing there. It was easier to go crazy than die. And in the end, one fucking bullet came out of nowhere, changed everything. But I still want to live, even like this. So get the fuck out of here. Stick it to the redhead. Live your life, damn it. Live it! Yours. Like I said, never mind the mess. I won't. How was Matanzas? Forget Matanzas. What do you like writing about? I like stories that are raw and touching. Like Salinger. Lately I feel like writing again. Because of you. Yeah, it's your fault. When I fall in love, it makes me want to write. You fall in love that fast? Sometimes even fasten Have you investigated me yet? I trust my nose. Things went south. They found material of ours at the pigeon loft. You didn't think to clean up. I warned you, Tony. This is your mess. I know, man. But I told you, nobody saw us. Are you sure? You know the last time I set foot in a church? My first communion. And when I walked out, I told my mom I would never go back. Sundays were for playing ball. What's up? What are you looking for? What I can't find anywhere, man. A place where people don't screw each other. I like your aspirations. Sometimes I think we spent our best years here. This is where I met almost all my friends. You, for example. Conde. I'm scared. And not for me. The guy who fell off the roof, Yosvani, was in the business. What if it was my fault? For asking about the drugs at the high school. Candito, my brother. I told you, forget about that. Be careful with those guys. You're not a super hero, you got that? Okay, brother, okay. Never mind. Forget it. I called you because I heard something that might help you. - Thanks, Maruchi. - Major. What mess are you in, Conde? You kept us waiting. Don't worry, this is getting good. Let's hear it. We'll go from simple to deep, like the song says. According to Captain Ciceren, the marijuana found in Lissette's apartment isn't common, it's Central American. And you said you caught two guys with the same stuff, right? Yes, but the supplier disappeared or the guys made up a ghost. They say it was a foreigner. Orlando Serov. Alias Lando the Russian. The foreigner. Apparently he's moving weed and all kinds of pills. Then get to work. And pull yourself together, Conde. I don't like police officers with existential problems. Is it true you're in love and you're writing again? Damn, people can't keep their mouths shut around here. What have you got? Nothing. But the mother says Lando rented a beach house. I sent Fabricio. You can go with him... So he can talk shit and say I'm stealing his case? No, thanks. Can I go too, Captain? Go ahead. Conde, why are you giving away such ajuicy case? That's what friends are for. If you go around giving away cases, you'll get nowhere. Let me know if you find Lando. You bet. L\ \ \ \ i\' Q Where are you going? Wait here, I'll be right back. Got you, shithead! Why don't you stay the night? I have a lot of work tomorrow. I'd rather sleep at home. Me too. But with you. You're going to get a speeding ticket. It's not that I'm going too fast. It's that I can't stop. Where the fuck were you? How did I not see you before? Looks like a Russian fucker. What has he said? Not much. We still haven't found out where he gets his drugs. He's protecting someone. He probably knows it's worse if he talks. I feel like there's something big and well organized behind all this. Orlando Serov. Explain to me why the marijuana we found in your house and Lissette's apartment are the same. Who is Lissette? Don't joke around. Tell me how all this crap is organized. Come in. Where's Captain Ciceren? Here to ask for more favors? What favors, Fabricio? If it's about Lando, it's my case now. Um 'Nah? That's great. Congratulations. Hey, Conde. I'm sick of your fucking irony and shitty attitude. Go fuck yourself. V\Ihat's going on here? Conde! - Conde! Conde! 4 know, Captain. At some point I'm going to smack him. - Are you crazy? - Okay. Okay, why I came. We still haven't been able to link Lando to Lissette. It's the same marijuana, but the fingerprints don't match the apartment. What? Anything new about Yosvani? You think Yosvani's death was related to Lissette's? Yosvani was in her class. And he was selling drugs. It's too coincidental. I don't know, but I have a hunch. It's somehow related to the high school. Or to that kid who was with Lissette the night she died. I can feel it here. Just keep your hunches to yourself. Mum! Hurry up, we're starving! I made this tamale with grated com, it's better than ground. I threw in some pork, chicken and beef ribs. Some day you have to tell me where you get all this food. I'll have to arrest you because you don't see beef ribs even on TV anymore. - Mom, is there more? - Yes. It's greedy to ask for seconds! This woman won't pick up. I'm positive she's not working. Where the hell is she? No more. - No more what? - No more rum. We're out of rum! I was dying to get totally shitfaced. And fucking pass out and stop thinking about my damn life. He's in bad shape. Stop drinking! Get me a complete list of all her male students. This year and last year. A complete list? Just do it! Look. Yuri, isn't that the cop investigating Lissette's death? Just the man I was looking for. I know you know something you don't want to tell me. I don't think it's related. I don't care. Just tell me. People at school said she did reviews with exercises almost identical to the exam. So Lissette liked her students getting good grades. I don't know about now, but in my time that was cheating. Which students went to the reviews? I don't know. Come on, Jose Luis. Somebody said something. I swear on my mom's life I have no idea. Really. You don't have many options. Either tell me what you know or I'll take you to the station and you'll tell me in front of everyone. What do we do? Now we're close. What happened? If what I found in the list checks out, it's a piece of cake. Spit it out already. Take it easy. The suspense is the best part. I wrote down the names of all of Lissette's students. And when I was almost done, I saw the name that can solve all of this shit. Lezaro Serov Valdes. There might be more, but so far, these are the boys closest to Lissette. Luis Gustavo Rodriguez, Yuri Samper Oliva and Lezaro Serov Valdes. Serov. Like Lando the Russian. How many Serovs are there in Havana? You're such a bastard. Lezaro Serov Valdes. 18 years old. 12th grade student at La Vibora, right? Yes. What was your relationship with Lissette? I didn't have any. Well, - she was my teacher. - Talk to me. Talk to me, Lezaro, this is serious. You tried to wipe your fingerprints. But you left some behind. Enough to prove you were in Lissette's apartment. Yeah, I was. She had a party, but... She loved having parties. You know who's in there? Lando the Russian. Your cousin. Accused of drug trafficking and possession. Drugs he hid in your home. Drugs you took sometimes, right? Listen, sir. I didn't kill her. I swear on my mom's life. Yuri and Luis can tell you. We partied, yes. It was all her idea. Because I... She started inviting me a few months ago. And a man is a man. So we started having sex. But nobody at school could know. I only told Yuri and Luis. But why would I kill her? Come here! Are you crazy? We were there in her mom getting hot. What? You want me to swallow that? Then tell those two to get out of my house. Get the fuck out. You too. Get out of my house! Leave! Get out! Leave. Leave me alone. But she was drunk and had taken pills. When we left, around ten, Yuri and Luis took the 15 and I took the 174 which stops closer to my house. And that's it. Nothing else. But you guys didn't tell anyone. Because we were scared. And we thought it was better... That it was better to keep quiet. To stay out of trouble. But that's what happened. I swear. I asked for her and they said she didn't go to work. But she's not sick, right? Okay, tell Karina I called. Thanks. And the lab results? They're not in yet. We have nothing. Lezaro's friends said they partied for a while but she got drunk and kicked them out. They left around ten. Yeah, but that means nothing. They could be protecting each other. Or Lezaro went back alone. You know what they said? That Lissette was giving Lezaro test answers. And he sold them for 5 pesos a question. Smart kid, huh? If that's true, killing her makes no sense. Lissette was his goose that laid golden eggs. But I think... Yeah? Oh, Candito. No, tell me. Okay, I'm on my way. I'll be right back. What's up? Squeeze the guys in the lab. Okay. Man, that dead kid has my head spinning. You think he was murdered? Look, Conde. The guy who runs the drugs in the neighborhood is called the Gardener. He lives in a building that looks like a beehive on Santos Suerez Street. On the top floor. His right hand is a guy named Tony. A huge black motherfucker who has it in for me. I'm not a snitch, Conde. I couldn't leave it alone. And I'm positive someone's protecting the Gardener. Who? I don't know. But someone's taking care of him. Damn it, Red. This is some heavy shit. Look, disappear for a while and get some fresh air. If there's any trouble, call me. V\Ihat's up, Red? Talking to the fuzz? Turn around, back to the bar. Move it! Hey, where's Candito? He left after you with... With a black bald guy? - Yeah. - Son of a bitch. Fuck! Cicerbn! We've got the boss. They call him the Gardener. But we have to pick him up right now. - V\Ihat? - Right now, let's go! Come on, Fabricio, let's go. Captain, I need to go with you. I didn't want to say this in front of Fabricio. But the bastards have a friend of mine who told me about the Russian and the Gardener. I understand. Let's go. Watch out! Take it easy, man. Take it easy. Don't make things harder for yourself. It's okay, look. Look. There. Get him out of the tub. It's okay. Damn it, Red! Rad! Don't die on me, damn it. Don't die, Red. Don't do this to me! You scared the shit out of me. Here you go. Conde. Okay, Lezaro. Everything is cleared up. The semen in Lissette's vagina is yours. Are you listening? Yours. You went back alone. You slept with her and killed her. I didn't kill her. We went in the bedroom and we did it. Then I left. Ask Yuri. When did you eat the pizza? You went back alone. Right, Lezaro? They left, but you stayed. You went back with the pizza. I don't know about any pizza. I left with my friends and that's it. Look, Lezaro. There's a witness out there who saw you go back to Lissette's. That's not true. I didn't go back. Yes, Lezaro. You bought the pizza and went back alone. I didn't go back alone. I left with my friends. The old man saw you, damn it! Lissette's neighbor takes out the trash every night at 11. And he just recognized you. You went back to kill her, didn't you? No. No, that's not what happened. The party's over, get out. Get up and leave. I don't want anyone here. Come here, baby. Are you going to do what I asked? I told you to forget the exams. You think I'm stupid? Why Stupid? I heard you're making money off the answers. Forget it, Lezaro. I won't risk my job for a brat like you. Come here. Take it easy, Lissette. Take it easy. You're going too far. Men deserve respect. Men? You think having a big dick...? Oh, my son. You can't even wipe your ass. It was all her fault. Let me go! You're going to give me those fucking test answers. You hear? - You got it? I'm a man. - Let go of me! Get your hands off me! Help! Somebody help me! Shut the fuck up! - Don't touch me! - Shut up! I tried to revive her. I swear. I didn't want to. What else could you expect? I hate to say it, Conde, but I have to admit you did a great job. As usual, in your own way. Contreras and Ciceren dream; "Manned me on the case. And the drugs? We have to trace all that shit back to the source. But that's not your case anymore. That's our problem. - How's your friend? - He'll live. Now what I can't stop thinking about is who fucking tipped off the Gardener. He even left his man behind! Of course, I can't interrogate him now. Thanks to Fabricio. Conde, Fabricio saved your life. You really believe that? I think the Gardener has friends in high places. I'm sorry, Major, but I can't allow the lieutenant to question the integrity of one of my men. Major, I'm only saying.. - Don't Major me! You're pushing it. You do what I say here. And you speak when I tell you. Or one day I'll have to break your balls. What are you doing here? Are you alone? Come in, come in. What happened yesterday? Was there a problem? Your phone got cut off, an earthquake... I'll believe any excuse you come up with. I don't have to explain myself to you. Why did you ask about me in the neighborhood? It's my job. I wanted to know what happened. Nothing happened. I got a call. But we were meeting. A call from my husband. Your husband? What are you trying to say? My husband gets back tomorrow. He's a doctor, he's in Venezuela. He called two days ago. They're sending him back early. I didn't have the courage to tell you the other day. But I thought you were separated. Mario, don't make things even harder. I don't know why I started this madness with you. I was having problems with my husband and I liked you... I think I needed to sleep with another man. But I picked the worst of all. I'm the worst? You fall in love, Mario. Well then? Nothing. I'm going home, back to my life. But I don't regret what happened. I wish you could forgive me. Do you care? Yes. I care. If you ever need to change a flat tire, let me know. Fixing disasters is my specialty I'm leaving, damn it! No, you're not. You're nuts. You can't leave like this, damn it. - Yeah, kid. - No. I'm going to die alone like a stray dog. But I'll tell you something. I fucking love you, man. Because you're my brother. You're Skinny and you're my brother! Oh, man. Don't start crying on me now. If you cry, you'll make me cry too. Then cry, damn it. Cry- I can't fucking stop. What are we? Two old drunk ladies!
