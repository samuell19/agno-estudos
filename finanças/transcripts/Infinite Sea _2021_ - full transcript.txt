This is a scam you know, a scam. So 've heard. REJECTED POSSIBLE WATER PHOBIA APPROVED ...which involved science and technology in an intimate way. If we don't understand that ourselves... So it seems to me that making people feel that science is accessible and they can understand what it's about to have some control of their own future is very important. There's the fact that science approaches many of the deepest questions which are the exhilaration of looking at a new world, for the first time in the history of human species the air images. ...for the first time you have no idea what it's going to be like. there it is... May I? Fuck. You wanna give me a heart attack? You're too mean to die. You got one of those? You're gonna get caught with this I'll have to cannibalize some computers. I should have one...

Seriously. If it was't for the fucking power going out. Yesterday I got into their system... You're almost there... How long did it take you this time? Four months, this time, but if you gave me more computers No. No way. Let's suppose you can decrypt that shit, and then what? You put your name on the list? And show up with luggage in your hand? You weren't summoned for a reason. Accept it. You would't know what it's like to be old and watch the young folk leave. I just think you should go because you believe. the age of individualism is over this is too important. If yo're looking for personal gratification, find a hobby. And what is that? Cherry tomatoes. You water it, put it in the sun, give it love and it will give you tomatoes. You have the fucking memory or not? I think I'm gonna dip my feet. Wanna come? Probably too cold. I won't let you drown. Looks infinite. I'm hungry. Where are we eating? I'm thinking. Gorgeous, right? This isn't really glamorous anyway. It does have its charm. This guy is like me, doesn't sleep. You don't sleep? Not much. Do you have insomnia? Sometimes I don't really have a schedule anyway. Do you work? Kind of. What about you? I don't do anything. Everybody does something. I don't.

Folks spent hours here doing who knows what... Now, ther's dust. There must be somebody with a lot of houses and nobody put in them. Gone to Proxima ... They coul've written Until Proxima (see you later). Do you believe it to be true? Sometimes, I think i's a scam and they're shooting the poor bastards into the sun Tha's horrible. ... or that there's nothing, no mission, no new world, no future just this. But yes, I think we were left behind. I think we are an outdated project and they are ... The future? You could say that. The idea is tempting but I do't know. Maybe we're just doomed to end where we began. The universe was't made for us. Would you come with me? We just met. Come on. Show me where you live. Do you play? The computer helps. Sometimes it doesn't feel like it. The computer does most of the work, so When it feels like it. When it feels like it. it's a software I wrote but never finished. Why not? Don't know I'm always leaving it for the next day, it simply has't happened yet. I think i's something that applies to my life in general. I's hypnotizing. What s this? I's complicated. I's a signal. What signal? Information, 'm trying to decode, maybe change. Why? Because I can. Because I need it, I guess. You could have just told me you didn't want to explain. Take a deep breath. won't let you drown. I water will hold you, do't be afraid. If you go under, 'll save you. Keep your arms streched out. Now float.

You can't swim, so that's two things we can't do together. Come on, get off. Ok, take a seat. Sit. Put your hands here. Are you holding on? I think so. Where are we going? Proxima Centauri. Perfect. And prepare for takeoff... three, two, one. Go back to sleep. Are you sleeping? Yes. Come on. 'll teach you. To sleep? I's an art 've been perfecting. Teach me. The first thing is to lay horizontally. Check. Then, check the bed for comfort, the pillo's texture and room temperature. Everything OK. You should avoid light pollution and sound. The machines are off. Great. Now close your eyes. Close your eyes. And go to a place where you feel good, where you feel comfortable It could be anywhere. Can I go with you? Yes. As long as it's not here You have to leave You have to get lost, in that place. What if I can't come back? I'll guide you back. You should turn that off. If there's no sun tomorrow, the battery will run out. You think it will hold? Don't know. You don't seem too worried. Nothing we can do. But wait. For what? The others. My son is up there. He visits me sometimes. But most of the time he is up there, waiting. In orbit, you mean? Floating, waiting. Waiting for what? Results. Why did you come here? How could I stay? Well, you do have a son What kind of father would I be if I did't give him this opportunity. What about you? I came looking for someone, I think. If yo're not sure of what you came here to do you wo't last long. I's too hard a concept for most people, too big. What is? This, what we're doing here. You mean die here? We didn't come here to make our lives better. We came to build a new one, for those who come next. Can't say if we are. We are. Just not in the way you imagined. Whatever it is you are looking for is not in there. I's outside or up there. ...a meticulous testing process in order to assess their ability to survive the journey. Natural comfort with water is essential. Hibernating in a wet cryo chamber, they experience a life similar to that of an unborn child to keep the brain functioning during this long journey. Subjects share a computer induced dream where they mix experiences and feelings with each other. This simulation allows them to interact socially while they live what is to them a normal life put together by pure computing power The journey is, in fact a second life, a cocoon like state on their way to their final and third life a life on Proxima Centauri. There they will help build the foundations of our next evolutionary step. Humankind as interstellar beings and existence that will no longer serve our selfish needs as individuals. But will instead fulfill a common purpose as a species. Very well. You know I do't like this stuff. Shut up, le's make a toast. To what shall we drink? The usual: to us or, better yet, to you both. To us. Would't she wanna join us? I doubt it. She looks lonely. I'll invite her. No, not worth it. Don't bother. Ricardo has an old friendship with the owner. Right? I'll drink to that. If that's where she wants to be I If tha's where she wants to be, so be it. If she wants a company 'll give it to her. What happened? She got left behind. Nobody likes being left behind. It's cruel. You're stuck in a kind of limbo, part of you stays and the other part goes away. I don't know how you can still smoke this shit. Tha's homemade production my friend A guy left me his greenhouse. Have you been sleeping? This would help. He gets up in the middle of the night. Still having those dreams? What dreams? Nothing. I have this recurring dream, that 'm floating or something. Was't it that you're drowning? Whatever. Have you learned how to swim? More or less. He sits in the corner making bubbles. I can teach you. Let's do this. First thing to learn is to float. Fill your lungs with air. Lie in the water, open arms, floating, lighter than water. You make it sound easy. Then, the front crawl, stretch your arms, hands relaxed alternate legs waving and breathe. The crown jewel: the dive. Hey, Ricardo, what the hell? You guys have to leave this place. You gotta leave this hole. You are the future. What about you? Me? I have no illusions. My future is to rot here with mankin's remains. But I'll leave the dreams to you. Well, you know, if you want more whisky, just hit the bar. I think I drank too much. What was the name of that woman at the restaurant? I don't know. You don't know? She never told me. We call her Madame. And you never cared enough to find out. I never asked. She was already there when I met Ricardo. I think I just got used to her presence, like a piece of furniture, invisible. I don't wanna be invisible. I see you. This wo't last. What? I'm not leaving. W're stuck in a limbo, like that lady. Broken in half. You look terrible. I know. I'm tired. Have you been sleeping? No. You have to rest. Why did you come here? I wanted to see you. No. Why did you come to this place? Maybe I'd already made up my mind before I met you or maybe I just got tired of our world. And you, why did you come? For you. Doesn't matter why we came, all that matters is that we are here. What are you doing? Looking for you. What if I'm not here? Where are you? With you, always. We travelled together, connected and we stayed connected. How? Like all the others who left. I don't remember. Do you remember meeting me? I remember the first time I saw you. You were sitting by the pool. What was I doing? Nothing. Thinking, I guess. You looked at me. I don't remember that. GONE TO PROXIMA B All I have are pieces of memories of that day. Is that what we are? Memories? Maybe. One day we will walk on another planet and remember these days of waiting. When do we leave? Sometimes I feel we already left. And that we are on our way, floating in space while we dream of our lives here. What do we do when we get there? What if you are not there? If I'm not there... Find me. Find me on the other side of the infinite sea.
