[ Dramatic music plays ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Indistinct conversations ] You are Rachel Cade? I'm kulu. I will take your baggage. This way, madami. Man: I tried to explain to him, but he will not listen. If it will make him happy, I will gladly give him more money. But, colonel, I do not want more money. All I want is my goat back. [ British accent ] You give him back his goat. Court dismissed. [ Crowd murmurs ] Man: Everybody to the outside! Everybody to the outside! Run along, matamuna. [ Train whistle blows ] On time. She'll be here. Sure she will. I understand she's American and very pretty. That's a relative quality of missionaries. She's a medical missionary -- a nurse. Madame derode used to say she had never known a nurse who didn't. Marie -- Marie! Of course -- you have an annoying habit of crediting my late wife with any salacious observation you are ashamed to claim as your own. Oh, really, colonel. I've heard on the highest and most lascivious authority in stanleyville that miss Cade is insatiably virtuous. I'm sure you'll try to take care of that. What? I said, "don't forget to wear your hat." [ Horn honks ] Welcome to rugeri, miss Cade. I'm Henri derode, the district commissioner. Kulu, your men hungry? No, colonel. Hey, soldier. I'm Dr. Musinga. Doctor? You're one of the boys who wash the floors of the hospital. I have an order here for 10 liters of petrol. You'll get five. All requisitions have been cut in half since the war in Europe. You're not new to Africa, miss Cade? No. Just to the jungle. Why did they send you here? To help Dr. Bikel in dibela. I've always wanted to bring our word to a more primitive area. This is a reward for -- no, thank you -- a reward for being patient at headquarters for so long. Curious -- I'm being punished and you're rewarded, and we're both in the same place. Why punished? Relieved of military duty -- colonel derode is an infantry officer. Thank you... Thank you very much. Oh. And given what amounts to a...Civilian assignment. What's wrong with being here? Well, this is a backward district. And, uh, dibela's a backward village in a backward district. Dr. Bikel's not exactly the missionary type. Find the climate bad for your health, and we'll have you transferred. You've just given me two more reasons for staying. Miss Cade, these people are perfectly happy with their illiteracy and their sickness and their... Cruel and simple gods. I don't think that's so. They just don't know any better way of living. [ Chuckles ] You know, I've seen you people come and go. I've seen you treat the syphilis the white man brought here two generations ago. I've also seen you write home to your mission that seven men came to pray on Sunday, and forgot to write that they were back at ritual torture on Monday. What sect do you belong to? None. What are you? Nothing. Nobody is nothing. Are you an atheist? I don't dignify the concept by being opposed to it. I believe that if god wasn't mentioned to a child, the child wouldn't think of it by himself. That would be a terrible loss for the child. Do you... Really believe this entire world just happened? If it didn't, whoever runs it is incompetent. I...don't think there's any humor in blasphemy. Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. You seem to be so, uh, so busy with abstract theology, and so ignorant of the practical aspects of our mission here. I understand. You've come to Africa to fight what you call "sin" with the words of Jesus. And you think that's wrong? I think it's presumptuous, even impossible. We've managed to push the devil back... Step by step since we've been here. Miss Cade... Has it ever occurred to you that you're asking a great deal of these people? And of yourself? I've never... Found it difficult. No, because you've pushed the devil off the road. That's dangerous. You might not realize how dangerous until you find yourself out there with him. You must envy my faith a great deal to attack it so easily. No, I envy your innocence. You think you've civilized them. I know the only reason we're alive is because there's an armed battalion in stanleyville. One simple, wooden cross keeps US alive. When it doesn't, all the guns in the world won't help. Thank you for your good intentions. By your leaving, I'd be seeming to be lacking in them. Then stop playing the rebel, colonel. It's daring at 20 -- at 40 it just looks foolish. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. On the contrary. My regards to Dr. Bikel. [ Door closes ] [ Engine turns over ] Please, stop here. [ Man speaking native language ] Why are they walking away? Kulu? We come to the mission very soon, madami. Miss Cade? Hello, doctor. Did you bring the drugs I ordered? Yes. They're right here. Oh. That's your hut. Kulu will show you. Oh...how was the trip? The trip was pleasant. I'll expect you for dinner as soon as you get yourself settled. Hello. What are your names? Kosongo. I am mzimba. What do you do at the mission? I cook. I do a little cleaning, madami. Thank you, kulu. Yes, madami. Miss Cade! Please, I'm changing. I can't find the Nitroglycerin! Well, I've brought what they gave me. Well, they forgot it! I'm -- I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to -- where do you come from, miss Cade? Kansas. I haven't done a very good job here. It's difficult alone. I can help now. I haven't done any missionary, or much practicing for that matter. We'll talk about it. I took up mountain climbing... And that's what's killed me. I have a bad heart, miss Cade. You needed the nitro for your -- well, we'll order some right away. I'm sure if they had known they would have sent some. If they had known, they would have sent me back. And -- and you didn't want to go? No. I don't know why, but no. What you need now is complete rest. You're just going to have -- Dr. Bikel? Kulu! Kulu! [ Shouting in native language ] Madami, is he dead? Yes, kulu, he's dead. Carry him to the hospital. Carry him, please. Where did the others go? I asked a question. They went away. I know that. Musinga will tell the people at the village. And mzimba? He is afraid, madami. Of death? No, not of death. Well, of what, then? Where are the patients? There are none, madami. Have there... Ever been any? No, madami. [ Drums beating in distance ] Kulu: Does madami read the drums? They're telling of Dr. Bikel's death. They're happy about it. Why? I do not know. Can you men make a coffin? Yes, madami. Is he to be buried here? In the morning. [ Drumbeat continues ] [ Squeaking ] [ Knock on door ] Yes? Madami -- yes, kulu? We are ready, madami. Thank you, kulu. You may lower the coffin. When this is finished, drive to rugeri and give this to colonel derode. Lower it. Lower the coffin. Go now, kulu. You! Get out of the car! Get out! In the name of muwango! I serve madami. You serve me! [ Engine turns over ] [ Transmission grinds ] [ Horn honks ] Hello. I was just sending kulu to tell you. I heard it on the drums. Musinga, what are you doing here? Go on. Clear out. This isn't necessary. You don't turn the other cheek, not with somebody like him. Muwango, we talk later. You'll need a new number-one man. Will kulu do until you leave? What do you mean, leave? Well, you can't stay here alone. I won't be alone. Kulu and kosongo and mzimba will be with me. I can order you out of here. I'm sure you know how unfair that would be to them. Miss Cade, you are so full of... Good works. I'd like to go on with the service, now. Please. I see you've been given a present. If I were you, I'd take it off. Why? This is a deliberate provocation to these people. I mean it to be, and I'm moving into Dr. Bikel's bungalow -- I wish you'd try and understand that to them you're an infidel. This warning is a reasonably civilized way of dealing with infidels. Are you sure you don't believe in this just a little, yourself? Perhaps. "The lord is thy keeper. "The lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. "The sun shall not smite thee by day... Nor the moon by night." "The lord shall preserve thee from all evil. "He shall preserve thy soul. "The lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in "from this time forth... And even forever more." Amen. How did it happen? Heart attack. I knew he was ill, but I had no idea. If you'll gather up his things, I'll send for them and see to the details. All right. Thank you, colonel. Henri. Henri. What are you going to do if you get any patients? What I've been trained to do. The mission won't send another doctor. Since the war, there aren't any. I know. You don't really believe in this? That's how practical magic works. You think it will work on me? It works on the guilty... And most of US are guilty. That's what destroys US. The death fetish only suggests it. Kalanumu's an excellent psychiatrist. Who's kalanumu? The high priest of dibela. I thought muwango was -- muwango is the medicine man. He does the legwork. The drums said Dr. Bikel died because he was punished. Tell me what he did. Well, he tried to climb the mountains, and that's sacred ground. So kalanumu put a thahoo on him. That's the biggest curse of all. And it seems to have worked. Dr. Bikel died of a heart attack from overexertion. It'll be stimulating having you around here, but don't you think you ought to reconsider? No. Aren't you being a little compulsive? I'm sure I am. That's how god's work gets done. I prefer a more comfortable relationship with god. Being a protestant missionary nurse precludes that kind of comfort. You know... You're an extraordinarily beautiful woman. I think that's something you don't like to face. [ Engine turns over ] Thank you again. Pleasure. Madami! Madami! The mountain, madami! Look! This is a rare thing to happen, madami. Does your god live up there? Yes. It is done, madami. Thank you, kosongo. That's fine. You've all worked very hard. There's just one thing missing -- the patients. I know, madami. Don't they look better, madami? Much better. Shall I paint another one? No, not now. Don't bother. Would you like to hear stories like those told in the palaver houses? I would, madami. Then I'll read to you from the book in which I believe. My book is called the Bible, and in it are many stories of god. At this -- Is something wrong? We do not tell stories of our god, madami. Our god lives in the ice caves of the mountain. He sends sickness and hunger when we have angered him, so we don't bring ourselves to his attention. Your god... You have a picture of him? Well...god is not a man. Is god a woman, then? No, h-he is -- well, god has no form. Your god must look like something. Uh, here. I-I do have a picture. The way a man named Michelangelo saw him many seasons ago. Mzimba: God is white? Uh, well... Black? People see god as they wish. H-He is neither white nor black. God is spirit. Go on, madami. Well, I'll tell you the most important story of all. One day, many seasons ago, god became very discouraged with the way people had forgotten him. He was displeased with the men that were stealing and killing and... Lying with the wives of other men. God is against lying with the wives of other men? Other than the lying of a circumcisioned brother with a wife? I'm not... Sure I understand. It's the duty of a man's brother, he who is circumcised at the same time at the same ceremony, to lie with the brother's wife when the brother's away. But that's wrong, kosongo. Terribly wrong. [ Airplanes overhead ] All white people have this god? Many of them. But not the enemy in the great war to the north, against whom the airplanes fly. The enemy, too. I do not understand. What is it you don't understand? The people of dibela could not make war against the people of rugeri, because we have the same god. How can your people make war on people who have the same god? They do, kulu. And that's one of the reasons god said to himself, "I shall send a son to them, in visible form, to teach them that it is wrong." So god's son was born on earth, and his name was Jesus the Christ. And he taught the word of his father across the land. Then you come here with this spirit of Jesus the Christ? I do. Is this spirit stronger than the god of the mountain? I believe that there is no god but god the father, kulu. That is only as you think, madami. The people of dibela believe in the god of the mountain, even though he is a bad god. Do, um... Do many of the people believe that he is a bad god? Most of US. The young ones. That is why I ask if god the father is stronger. He is much stronger. He will protect you and all who worship him, because he is the good father of US all. Is your god strong enough to cure the son of wanga? Cade: What's wrong with the son of wanga? The god of the mountain is killing him. Wanga went with Dr. Bikel when he tried to climb the mountain. When kalanumu put upon Dr. Bikel the thahoo, he also put it upon wanga. The cold breath of god froze the life from wanga and now the thahoo is in the belly of wanga's son. He, too, dies of it. Where is this boy? In the village. Take me to him, kulu. [ Dogs barking ] [ Child crying ] Madami... If you must do this, do not try it without seeking the permission of chief buderga. Chief buderga? I am Rachel Cade. Sit down, please, Rachel Cade. Gwinda. These are my wives. What is it you wish, Rachel Cade? I wish to see the son of wanga. For what purpose? He is ill, and I may be able to help him. No one can help him. I'd like to try. It is forbidden. Do you forbid it? It is not given to me to forbid or otherwise. I rule and judge, but only muwango rules of medicine. Do you want the boy to die? I pray that kalanumu's thahoo kills him quickly and mercifully, as it did Dr. Bikel and wanga. I don't think you believe that any more than I do. Thank you for your visit. Rachel Cade... Mia, my wife number three and the wife of my heart, has never been with child. Can your medicine bring a child to her? I see... It depends on who the patient is. No. If that can be done, a doctor would have to treat your, uh... Wife. She is my wife. Kalanumu performed the ceremony in this very shamba. I don't doubt it. I hear in your voice that something is wrong. It isn't right to have more than one wife. My father and my father's father were taught that a rich man must have many wives. Our father -- the father of all of US -- teaches that it's wrong! Then it is a matter of opinion. I do not wish to change your opinion. I had no luck, kulu. I could hear, madami. The chief is not a bad man. Buderga is what we call in my country a politician. He's a good man, so long as it's not too risky to be a good man. So that the chief could make his wife of child, could Dr. Bikel have used his medicine? Perhaps. I wish a new doctor would come. That's not possible. [ Child crying ] There's nothing you can do. Don't be afraid. Uhh. Uhh. There's a part inside your son's body that must be cut out. It's called the appendix. I've helped many times when doctors have done this, but I have never done the operation myself. If I do this, your son may die, but if I don't, he will surely die. Madami, you cannot! I must. If you do nothing and the boy dies, the young people of the village will know you tried to fight kalanumu and failed. But if you cut into the boy and he dies, they will blame you and be against you forever. I'll have to take that chance. Do you trust me to do this cutting? Yes. Do it, madami. If the thahoo can be cut out, do it! Madami -- it's best that I do it, kulu. [ Shouting in native language ] [ Shouting in native language ] No, kulu! No! Muwango, you will not kill this child. Let US alone. Man: Muwango! Rachel Cade, I am kalanumu, priest of dibela. I ask you this -- will you break our law and defy our god? If your law kills children, yes. Religion must have order and law, Rachel Cade. Where there is disorder and challenge to the law, it perishes! I ask you for the last time to think on it again. Your religion must change for the better as the world changes for the better. Those who practice my religion have many faults, but the murder of children for the glory of god is not among them. You will not stop? No. Then, Rachel Cade, I pronounce upon you this thahoo -- the god of the mountains shall shake your faith in your own god! You will violate his laws, and for this you will be tormented all the days of your life! You, kulu, you are a poor, bewitched fool. But for the sake of your ancestors, who lie buried in our village, I will pray for you. He found a hen, colonel, one I had marked! He's a man who thinks he owns everything! Thank you. Court dismissed. Philippe, I'll hear this in the morning. Where's my coat? In the dining room. What is it? What's the matter? Rachel Cade's doing surgery on a boy in dibela. The political repercussions of this might be unpleasant. Guta? Guta: Yes, sir. Find the sergeant. Tell him I want a truck and two men. If anything happens to that boy... Colonel... I know I'm too old to be rescued from anything, but would you mind telling me when you'll be back? When she's safe. [ Wind howls ] Raise his feet, kulu. [ Bed squeaks ] Put that up there. Madami. We must wait. All we can do now is pray. [ Howling continues ] Thirsty... Thirsty... Thirsty... I'm thirsty. Kulu, he's going to be all right. Kulu... Kulu, he's going to live. I know, madami. I saw them, and they told me. I talked to god the father and Jesus the Christ. I did, madami. They were sitting under a limba tree and I said to them, "please help madami to save wanga's son "because her spirit is great and tender... And she will be crushed like grass if he dies." Jesus the Christ turned to me and smiled... And I knew it would be all right. Please, madami. Is he dead? He's going to live. Have you any idea what forces you've been playing with? I think so... But it doesn't make any difference now. It does to me. I happen to be the administrator here. You can go out there and tell cadu she's going to have her son back. [ Crowd murmurs ] Cadu? Where's cadu? Kosongo: Here, colonel. Cadu... Rachel Cade has cut the thahoo from your son. He's going to be well and healthy again. [ Crowd murmurs ] You can take her in. Muwango... From now on, you and these elderly gentlemen will be very small and very quiet. Hmm? Colonel... This is a great victory for Rachel Cade and her invisible god. Chief, don't hurt yourself by climbing on the bandwagon. Hmm? Nothing. I heard you out there. Do you have to support their superstitions? Couldn't you just tell them I cut out his appendix? You'd better get ready for the party. What party? This is a big moment for the young, left-wing element of dibela. Isn't that right, kulu? There will be a big party, madami. [ Upbeat African music plays ] [ Laughter in distance ] [ Speaking native language ] [ Speaking native language ] [ Chuckles ] This is giza who has cooked for US. Hello, giza. Kulu... Try to think of it as a duty. Go on. [ Chuckles ] I am Mia, third wife of chief buderga. The chief wishes to know if you will eat from his personal cooking pot. It is a great honor. Tell the chief, "yes, thank you." The people would like to do honor to you. They have prepared a dance. [ Music stops ] [ Speaking native language ] [ Cheers ] [ Slow African music plays ] This is the dance of the love of a man for a woman. I can see that. [ Tempo increases ] Come. I was hoping you would come. Why? We talk well, you and I, in spite of our differences. Our differences seem to be getting worse. Mmm. Good? Good. Better than tobacco? Much better. One sees things so plainly. Will you remove the thahoo you've put on Rachel Cade? Does she suffer? She begins to. I cannot. You laid it on. The god of the mountain laid it on, through me. You don't believe that. Why not? That is what you believe in your world. I don't believe in anything. You believe in thahoo. It is because you have no faith of your own that you believe in thahoo. Well, don't lecture me. Why are you so concerned with Rachel Cade? Because she's a good woman. Do you want to sleep with her and fear that she will not let you? No. [ Exhales ] Yes. Of course. Once when I was young, I forced an unwilling young girl -- next you'll be asking me to eat a dead chief. Just because you got me smoking this damn pipe, I'm not all heathen yet. I said nothing. You and I are good friends. We understand things that men of all colors don't like to recognize. Don't fight me in this. I will do what I must do. I will go back there now to play the part of the high priest, and you the part of the bwana administrator. And there's no reasoning between US? Only in the shamba. Thank you. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Silence ] Kalanumu: Hear me, people of dibela. Tonight, many of you have strayed from your god. You have made him angry, and he will not forget. He will search you out and punish you unless you bow before him. To save yourselves, you must leave here now, and go back to -- you make bad medicine, yet you threaten with the anger of the god of the mountain all those who dare not to oppose the good medicine of madami. Wanga and Dr. Bikel challenged the god of the mountain. Tell the people where they are now. Wanga and Dr. Bikel are dead. They are dead because their time had come to die. I will waste no more words. Muwango, by my sign, heals the sick in dibela! All those who take part in the white madami's medicine will share her thahoo! Muwango, why do you always carry your tunic over your right arm? It is as I wear it. You can't let US see what's underneath? It is forbidden to interfere in these matters. It says so in your law. Muwango wears it so because underneath he hides a deep ulcer. If muwango's medicine is so strong, why can't he cure his own ulcer? [ Crowd murmurs ] This is not honorable. I warned you. It will not get you Rachel Cade. But it will get her patients for her hospital. The son of wanga was plucked from the dead by madami's medicine. Tonight he sleeps the peaceful sleep of a child. You've heard the colonel. You've heard the madami, and you heard me. Who will be the first to dare to bring his sickness to our hospital? Can madami waken my son from the sleep that never ends? She will try. Can madami cure the fever that goes and returns again? She can. [ Man speaking native language ] Muwango, decree the punishment for those people. These people have done nothing wrong. You have no right -- hear me! If any harm comes to the people who seek the madami's medicine, the soldiers will spill the blood of those who have done it. This gathering's at an end. [ Murmuring ] I thought you were asleep. Thank you. I was just playing in local politics. Yeah, I know. Good night. Rachel... What do you want? I do not feel well. There's nothing wrong with him. He's here for bad reasons, to watch thahoo. I know why he's here. Let him stay. Yes, madami. Mzimba, next patient, please. Just go over here and sit on the table. [ Man grunts ] Can you cut the bad part out? No, I cannot. I can only give you something for the pain. You cut the bad part out from the boy. That's different. This is in the bone, and my medicine is not great enough for cutting into the bone. [ Door closes ] Does the book tell how to cure the boy that sleeps? I'm not sure what's wrong with him, kulu. It takes a doctor to find out. God the father will send US a doctor. I'd like to talk to you about something. Yes, madami. Have you known giza long? Oh, very long. She would make you a good wife. Have I done something wrong? Kulu, the Bible forbids a man to be with a woman outside the marriage vows. To do otherwise is a very great sin against god -- the sin of adultery. But I have not taken the marriage vows. What you have done is still sin -- the sin of lust. This is only natural. To beasts... Not to man. To be without this sin, this may be possible for a white, madami, but it is not a rule for all. It's our mission here to make it the rule for all. Good night, madami. [ Door opens, closes ] But, madami, I do not understand. Mia, not being able to have children is something -- there's just nothing I can do. Mia... Mia... Do not be sad, madami. The doctor who's to come will do great medicine. There are no doctors to send here. I've talked to god -- I don't want to hear! I'm sorry. I know, madami. I know. To keep it from getting any worse, I'll just give you these pills. Madami! Madami. He's dead. [ Airplane engine roaring ] [ Sputtering ] Kulu, get my case! See if there are any others. Don't bother. They didn't stand a chance. They were all in the cockpit when it blew. It's broken. Go get some thick branches to make a splint. Don't tell me they give those first-aid courses in the jungle. I'm a nurse. Here? I'm a missionary to these people. What's your name? Rachel Cade. American? Yes. So am I -- Paul wilton. What's that for? I'm not going into shock. How do you know? I'm a doctor. Hello, madami. Hello. Hello, madami. How was lunch? You know hospital food -- snake meat. I thought you would join me. How do you feel? Grateful. You've got a few râles. I listened to your chest while you were asleep. A rib, maybe? I don't know, let's see. Divorced? Widowed? I've never been married. It's nothing. Maybe a little, low-grade infection in the pleura. Probably. If I were you, I'd prescribe a little internal alcohol, if you have any around. Yes, we have some. Good. You know, you run a good show here, doctor, but are the local residents Christian scientists? Oh, I mean, not many patients. All we need is a doctor, doctor. Thanks. Well, how about yourself? No. Oh, I never touch the stuff, either -- except in extraordinary times. And these are extraordinary times. Sorry. Sit down and tell me -- what are you doing in darkest Africa? What are you doing in medicine? That's easy. There's money in it. In the r.A.F.? Good training. It'll pay off later. Don't get your back up. Sit down and be pleasant. I have, uh, work to do. Oh, come on, come on, sit down. I do think it's wonderful of you to have volunteered. Before the war comes to Boston? Is that where you're from, Boston? In Boston we say [Boston accent] "Boston." Okay -- "Boston." This could make me one of the top orthopedic surgeons in the states, and that's why I volunteered. I'm sure your motives are better than that. I'm probably basically what you are. And what's that? Oh, nothing bad -- an adventurer. What's the matter? I'm here to save these people from disease and sin, and no other reason. That's what missionaries do, but it can't be that grim. It isn't. Don't be so hard on yourself. [ Door opens ] Excuse me. Come back. Madami, it is to your wish that we marry? Yes, kulu. Then we wish to. I'm glad. My congratulations to both of you. Will you want the ceremony in the village? We wish to marry as you marry, madami. I wish there were a minister here to marry you in the church, but we'll get colonel derode to do it. Thank you, madami. [ Door closes ] You might not be doing well in the disease department, but you sure got sin on the run. Now, how about that drink? No. We're friends, aren't we? Yes. Then I'll have one for you. "...to bear with each other's infirmities and weaknesses, "to pray for each other "in the things which pertain to god, and to live together as the heirs of grace of life." Kulu, "will you have this woman to be your wife "in all love and honor, to live with and Cherish "according to the ordinances of god in the holy bond of marriage?" Now you say, "I will." I will. Giza, "will you have this man to be your husband, "to live with him and Cherish him "according to the ordinances of god in the holy bond of marriage?" Now you say, "I will." I will. "Then by the authority vested in me, "I declare kulu and giza are now husband and wife. "According to the law of the district of dibela, "whom therefore god hath joined together, let no man put asunder." That's all! [ Laughter ] Congratulations. Be happy. Thank you for reading the service. I'd like to see your patient. Kulu, congratulations. [ Replies in native language ] Have you been well? All right... Except for the fact of Germany overrunning Belgium. I know what it must mean to you. Well, at least the British will hold the Congo for US. This is Henri derode. Paul wilton. How do you do? Sit down. I won't be long. I've had a wire of inquiry from your headquarters asking how long you'll be recovering. I don't know. I hope you laid it on thick in your first wire -- "knocked out of the sky in darkest Africa, crawled for days in tiger-infested jungle." I said you'd broken your leg, and there are no tigers here. No tigers, huh? Just beautiful, white madamis. He has to tell them something, Paul. He already has. All right, tell them six weeks, maybe more. There are some operations badly needed here. When Paul's well enough, he's going to do them for US. Splendid. Rachel, doctor. Colonel... Why don't you say what's on your mind? Why? Because looking it is just as bad. There's no need -- I think there is. I think there's some operations needed in your outfit. Probably, I've been doing them for more than a year, and my outfit's still the going business. And mine's been conquered. You brought it up. I know you're sensitive about the surrender, Henri -- I don't like hearing it from Americans. Henri, he's with the British. He's a volunteer. He's in love with you. Henri... You're being childish, both of you. Why not? You don't approve of me behaving like an adult. You have no right to do this. No? I started a fire and Dr. Wilton's going to warm his backside with it. How long have you had this? She doesn't know. To some of them, time isn't like it is with US. All right, have her come back in a week. Here. Throw one away each sunrise. When they're all gone, you come back. [ Kulu mutters ] [ Door closes ] What's wrong? These people let each other die, and time is meaningless to them. Some of them can't even count. Then why bother with them, is that it? Well? These people are human beings. If her life is a burden, her child's can be better. But why do you have to make it better for them out here in the middle of nowhere? Why do I? You don't have to. Uh-huh, so I flunk the test. I don't know what you mean. [ Chuckles ] You've been watching my reactions to see if you approve of me -- if I'm Christian enough for you, right? That's ridiculous. I'm just thankful you're a doctor and that you're here. I wish to see the doctor. Now what? Chief buderga. Dr. Wilton, this is chief buderga and his third wife, Mia. What can I do for you? I wish you to use your medicine so that this wife can have my son. The madami said a doctor would be able to do so. Do you have other children? 11. Well, that lets you off the hook. Please, sit down. Don't be frightened, Mia. Would you mind waiting in one of those chairs, please? [ Woman speaking native language ] Drada has no more of the fever pills. Is it quinine? Quinine is correct. How do you feel, drada? A little better. Good. Give her the same amount. And don't forget to add it on her record, kosongo. Yes, madami. Paul: That's all. You can step down now. Mia... It's only minor. It can be taken care of. Give her the pills. I'll let you know when the doctor will be ready. Thank you. I don't get it. Now what's the matter? She was surgically mutilated. The medicine men do that when they're young. That isn't what stops Mia from having children. The women can't enjoy married life very much. I suppose not. You suppose not? I suppose not. The men feel it makes the women seek contentment in the deeper satisfactions of marriage -- in bearing children and working and maintaining a stable family. Where or when did you first feel these pains, madam? Please sit down. Don't be nervous. What's Swahili for "say 'ahh'"? Paul: Sponge. Clamp. Clamp. Cold? No. What's the matter, then? I don't know. All is well with the world. The surgery has been successful. Kita's walking again. Mia's pregnant. Maybe it's because you're leaving soon. It's going to be an awful letdown when you go. For them or for you? For all of US. You're still having the shakes. Better? Mm-hmm. Paul? Mm-hmm? What do you want to make of your life? Oh, what every man wants -- skill in his work, public approval, money. I want to do just two operations a day on wealthy patients. And the poor ones? It's so easy to get a rise out of you. No, I'll do my day a week at the clinic, but then I want to drive home in a large car, and have a large Martini. And that's all you want, hmm? Rachel, very few people have to hand out pills and save souls to feel right inside themselves. Isn't that hitting below the belt? But it's true. Did you hear what I said? Yes, I heard you. I don't think you did. I said, "I love you." Rachel... Please -- shut up. No. I love you. Can't you understand? No! Boy... You are something. Look, Rachel, I'm sorry. I know things aren't easy for you. Please, let's forget it. That's the trouble. I can't forget it. So I think it better if I leave here now. Don't worry. I'll do the operations we have scheduled. But then it's finished. All right. Good night. [ Door closes ] Okay, is that my last? Yes, sir. Good. That's it, then. Shew! Well, that's better. What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, come on, now. You don't really believe you're in a state of sin, do you? I believe in the Bible. Well, so do I, but... This is 1940. There's no date on morality. We're not exactly in a state of grace. Why not? Don't be so contemptuous of it, Rachel. It keeps the race going. Are we keeping the race going? Well, I hope not. Rachel, I didn't mean to -- I wish you could leave with me when I go. I can't leave all these people. There are people in London, too -- wounded people who need nurses. They're not going to let me stay here forever. It's just no good. I can't leave here, not now. Don't you see -- for love, for what I want -- how wrong it would be? I'm so tired of what's right and what's wrong. These things take care of themselves. Not for me, they don't. Oh, yes, they will. They will. [ Sighs ] It was the woman who ruined paradise, wasn't it? This just came on the wire, colonel. Thank you. I'll, uh, drop you a line from stanleyville. I'll write as soon as you let me know where. Write to the address I gave you in London. I'll let you know when I'm someplace permanent. Well... [ Murmuring ] This shield is for the doctor to bear always on his arm, to protect his heart when he faces the northern enemies. Chief. This was the spear of my grandfather. With it he destroyed many enemies. With it the doctor will see victory and return to US. Thank you, kulu. Well, I'm very grateful to all of you. I'll miss you... And take care of madami. Another cup of coffee? No. No, thank you. I'm sure the colonel will be here any minute. Oh, I forgot -- the mail for the mission. And there's another card from the doctor. Excuse me. Paul: Dear Rachel, moved out of the last base I wrote you about, but still in england. Same g.P.O. Hope all goes well. Love, Paul. Hello. Hello, Henri. How have you been? I'd like to talk to you. All right. What is it? I am resigning. I'd -- I'd like you to telegraph this to mission headquarters in stanleyville, please. Would you mind telling me why you're doing this? I'm pregnant. That dirty -- it takes two to be dirty in this connection, Henri. Did you know before he left? No. Did you write him? No. Why not?! I can't. You're a damn fool. If he thought now was the time to marry, we would have right here. Oh, now is the time, all right. And do you love him? Well, of course, I love him. How else do you think -- [ mutters ] All right. Perhaps your sin isn't so great. Maybe you stayed with him to keep him here. To help the sick people of dibela? Something like that. No. It was because I loved him, nothing else. Are you sure he loves you? Yes, I'm sure. Even though he didn't ask you to marry him? He was going back to the war. I never understood that point of view -- "I can't marry you because I might be killed." I can't see the difference between being a widow and just being left. At least a widow gets a pension. Please send the wire. When will you tell him? When he comes back. Rachel, this is nonsense. You don't have to do this at all. You apply for a leave of absence. I know of an order of sisters, they understand these things, you can have your child there, and they'll bring it up. You're not serious. I'll keep this baby with me always. What did you think? I think you could deliver it yourself. Well, thank you... If that's a compliment. It's a compliment. Um... I'll let you know where I want to go. You mean where you want to run to. You don't seem to understand. I can't face these people. They'll forgive you. But I can't forgive myself. I've betrayed every missionary who's ever suffered and died in Africa. I've dishonored my church just as surely as you'd dishonor the army if you ran from the enemy. In your own words, god judges and forgives, not the sinner. That's not enough for me. I want -- you want to be punished, I know. I found out something about you, Rachel. You didn't conquer kalanumu's vengeful god of the mountain. You couldn't -- he was inside you. He still is. Here... Somewhere in Matthew. Jesus said unto the priests, "verily I say unto you "that the publicans and the harlots "go into the kingdom of god before you. "For John the baptist came unto you "in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not, but the publicans and harlots believed him." Primarily it's a matter of love and faith -- not whether you're a sinner. Sin can sometimes corrupt love and faith. Henri, a missionary just can't have an illegitimate child and go on as though nothing had happened. Mary magdalene was a common streetwalker and she went on to become a Saint. You listen to me, Rachel. If you leave here, there's no one to take your place. There are patients in that hospital now that'll be dead within a week without you. What about kulu and kosongo and mzimba? How do long do you think their faith will last? Look what you've accomplished. You have no right to leave. No matter how much guilt you feel or how much you suffer, you have to stay. You have to. [ Sobbing ] I don't want to leave here, Henri. I don't want to go. Come on. Come on. [ Engine turns over ] [ Vehicle departs ] What are you reading it for? You were listening. It's a good thing I make it my business to hear what goes on in this office. What are you going to do now? Have a drink. What are you going to do about her? Nothing. Do you really believe that the news of a white baby crawling about dibela isn't going to get back to stanleyville? Of course it will. If you still love her, and you want her to stay here -- well, you do, don't you? Yes. Then you'd better do something about it. Mail, madami. Thank you. You can open the door now, kulu. Yes, madami. Paul: Dear Rachel, great news -- I am being medically discharged. The leg didn't heal the way it should've, through no fault of yours, of course. Nothing to worry about, however. I have a very good offer for a practice in Boston. With luck and the right timing out of here, I can bring it off. Meanwhile, let me know what you're doing in dibela. Love, Paul. It's a letter from the doctor, madami? Yes. Does he say when he will return? He doesn't say. [ Clatter ] [ Murmuring ] [ Kosongo speaking native language ] Madami... I'll be all right in a few minutes. I'm going to send the out patients home. No, have them wait. I do not wish to disobey you, but I am going to tell them to come back tomorrow. What do the people really think of me now? They are sad for you. They don't feel contempt for me because I've sinned as I said they must not sin? They are sad because you are sad. They do not judge your sin. And you? I do not judge because you have taught that Jesus the Christ said that we must not judge. The madami carries her baby heavily today. Please come back tomorrow. What did you say? Nothing. He said madami will not arise tomorrow to give US her medicine. You have sudden courage this morning, musinga. From where does it come? What is it you know? Nothing. Speak of what you know while you can. Kalanumu is sick. The days of his life are fewer. He makes the thahoo move faster. Watch the madami. Give her the medicine as she needs it. [ Muttering ] My son... Yes. Here is last great secret for you. Tell it. I die... But your madami's thahoo does not die with me. You lie. Not in death. I speak quickly now. Kulu, there is no thahoo other than the one we make to punish ourselves, and that is the strongest of all. I do not torment your madami. She torments herself because she has violated her own laws, and only she can bring peace to herself. [ Gasping ] If she learns this, she can be well. Why do you tell me this? I have seen... The healing she has done. I-I die now... Somewhere between my god...And hers. [ Murmuring ] [ Baby crying ] A son has been born to madami. [ Crowd murmurs ] Guta... Guta... Yes, sir? Tell stanleyville their convoy is passing through on time. Yes, sir. Aren't you going to finish your dinner, colonel? [ Grunts ] [ Telegraph clicking ] Lots of excitement. Yes. Sorry I haven't been over to dibela more often. You can see why. Have some dinner with me. No, no, thank you. You go ahead and finish. I hear you're drafting single men. Yes, if the Italians are to be stopped in the north, it has to be with African troops. What did you name the baby? Paul Jr. "Paulie," we call him. I've come for the mail. Yes, I've got some for you. I didn't have anybody to send, so -- here you are. There's nothing from him. I guess I'd better be -- Rachel, you haven't heard from him since before the baby was born. You keep count as closely as I do. I have as much interest. I want you to see things the way they are. I don't want to listen. If he loves you, he'd have written or been here. There's his practice, money, his own future. If they come before his love, you don't want him. He knows you can't keep love without those things. You're the one who doesn't see things the way they are. I don't believe he'll come back. He loves me and I love him. Can't you see that? Can't you see that it's not necessary for a man to love a woman to go to bed with her? That's you -- no, that's not me. I happen to be the damn fool that loves you -- without it. Rachel, listen. I love you, and I'm here. I think in a little while, you'll learn to love me. You have a child that needs a father. You need a husband. I thought I'd been in love many times before, but never like this. Marry me... Because I love you. I love you. [ Door closes ] Guta? I want to send a cable. All right? Yes, sir. To captain Paul wilton -- get his g.P.O. And squadron number from r.A.F. Headquarters, stanleyville. Yes, sir. Paul wilton Jr., born to Rachel, 5th of march, 1941. Signed, derode. I want to send another one. To general commanding army headquarters, stanleyville, from Henri derode, colonel, royal infantry. Subject -- active duty. Respectfully request immediate transfer with African troops, Ethiopian-Kenya front. Sign it and get it off urgent. All right, sergeant, load them up. Yes, sir. [ Shouting in native language ] [ Shouting continues ] Ready, sir. Follow out! Drive. [ Bell ringing ] Hello. Hello, yourself. Uh, I've never seen you as a civilian before. [ Chuckling ] Well, it's me. Oh, the car's over here. Welcome, doctor. Kulu. Your bag, please. I have someone who wants to see you. A surprise? Well, a surprise is sort of an understatement. Hello, sweetheart. [ Train whistle blows ] Hello, Paulie. You knew about him? Yes. Take him back to the car. Yes, madami. Why did I have to hear about him from derode? Did you hear me? Yes, I heard you. Henri told you. Why? Why not from you? I wanted you to come back because you want to, not because you have to. I wanted to. Not because Henri brought you back? Of course not. Are you sure, Paul? Are you sure? I'm sure. By the way, where is the good colonel? Active duty, fighting. Well, then I won't have to cope with him, too. Now, wait just a minute. Henri derode is a fine -- I know, I know. I'm sorry. Now let US stop all this arguing. I'm here, and we're going to be married. All right. And live in Boston. I know. Oh, I've told everyone I'm marrying a widow with a child. Why? How else do we explain the sudden appearance of Paulie out of the jungle? Do we have to start out like this, with a lie? Yes, we do. To begin with, I've never told anyone about you. Isn't that odd, not to have told your best -- I don't think so. Look, is this another test I have to pass? No. No, i-I'm sorry. This is no way for US to begin. Come on. Madami. Cannot the doctor stay and work here? No. Even for your sake? You have asked him? This is not his world, kulu. I remember when you first brought this to dibela. [ Voice breaking ] Don't, kulu, don't. Let me. Would you like some coffee? No, thanks. Paul, I know you're anxious to get back as soon as you can. That's right. Can't we stay just a little while, until they get someone to replace me? You knew I was coming. Why haven't you arranged it? It's so difficult to get people with the war on. The war is going to last for years, but I'm not, nor are you. It'll be just as hard to leave two weeks from now as it will be tomorrow. But they're not prepared to run the hospital yet. Rachel, you are going to make a clean break. You can't love me. You can pull out all the stops, the answer is still no. You came to marry me because of Paulie, didn't you? Only Paulie. I can take the truth. All right, you think that's wrong? You hold it against me? Look, no matter how much I loved you, I'd still go back to practice my profession and bring up my child in my own world -- and his. Then you don't know love. And you do, huh? Yes. Do you think we have the right to marry without love? Right? You're the last person in the world I ever expected to hear that from. I'm sorry things turned out the way they did, but we both have a duty to Paulie. I've come thousands of miles to give him a name and a father. You don't have the right to keep him illegitimate, not according to your code. Now, tomorrow's Sunday. There's a train out of rugeri at noon. You and I and Paulie are going to be on that train. [ Door closes ] You'll read the service, kulu? Goodbye, Rachel Cade. Kulu. Forgive me... I can't. [ Murmuring ] "The lord is in his holy temple. "Let all the earth wait before him. "May the words of our mouths "and the meditations of our hearts "always be acceptable... "In thy sight. "We are his people, and the sheep in his pasture. Seek the lord while he may be found." [ Voice breaking ] Kulu. I read from the psalms of David the king. "Have mercy upon me, o god. "Blot out my transgressions. "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, "and forgive my sin. "For I acknowledge my transgressions, "and my sin is ever before me. "Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, "and sinners shall be converted unto thee. "O lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise." God bless the fighting men of dibela. God bless colonel Henri derode, and bring him safely home. Amen. -- Captions by vitac -- Burbank, Pittsburgh, tampa, and Washington, D.C. Captions paid for by Warner Bros. Inc.
