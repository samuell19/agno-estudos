My parents are rich. I would be lying if I said I see then, a lot. - Two visits in 2 years. - Why did they send you here? My mother remarried. My stepfather hates me. When I flunked math, he got rid of me. This is horrible! What did your mother say? That she wasn't to blame. She's crazy about him. You know? But she writes to me. She sends me money and letters.

Less for the darlings. Blondeau is a nice guy. Also good with the knife. The father died in the war, his mother died when he was born. We are alike. He is no longer the Stutterer. Now it's One-Eye! Molina is crazy. Isn't he? We are all afraid of the scoundrel. He rats on everyone for supervisors. He's already sent several to solitary confinement. Go after everyone the new boys. Did he go after you? In the beginning. - Do the supervisors let you? - They don't care. If you cornptam. They spank you for lying. Arid some of them don't dislike it.

You bitches! Wait until everyone is served! I an, hungry. That wouldn't fill a cavity! If this continues. I will complain. Tell another. Be content with playing the piano. - Complain to whom? - For the director. You are very passive. Quite frankly how we work so hard and are we so malnourished? You get tired sleeping on the balls of mothballs from the warehouse? I swear if I complain to the director I will get a lot. Is there a problem. Morand? No. Boss; It's okay. - He is sure? - Yes-boss. Coward: Sissies: Shit! The principal appears, and he shits himself. Surely your parents have money! They're just going to work outside. Blondeau is a car mechanic. Stop drearninq. Tr~guier. Tonight. They'll be back. The only advantage the long hair. - Good morning. Trequier. - Good morning Boss. No I'm supervisor. Boy. Call me Mr. roux. How your friends. Or old Roux. - Yes. Sir. Roux. - Come with me. He is my best pupil. Soon you'll be as good as I am. This is his workbench. Cut this pipe into pieces 5 cm long. Pass me your saw. He will break it. It's clumsy. He arrives! Don't talk to me like that. Look. Constant movements. Watch what you are doing. Now try. Do not lean on the blade. It will break it. Do not grip the saw so tightly. Do not grip the saw so tightly. Do not grip the saw so tightly. I'll come see you later. Are you happy. Fish face? Now you are a rnetallurgist. The way you kissed his ass. Should be crown. Pretend you're a man with those long pants? It's just appearance. You are a coward. You are a coward. Aren't you? I spoke to you. Reply when the elders talk to you. You are a little pussy. Say. Say that you It's a little pussy. Say! I'm a little pussy. Did you hear? You will love it. Guess what he said. - Ask him. - Leave him alone. Come help me. Give that to Frigo. Stop! Dishes. So Molina screwed you. It happens. That's not a problem. You said everything Red told you to say. He could have left you on your knees. After all your talk about running away... - Good night. Maybe? - Red-haired... - You shouldn't have done that. - What is it. Brat? Do you want me to make you eat your pants? He deserves a slap. Try it! Kick his balls. I take care of Molina. He will catch. \Nhatthen? Is it enough? He grabbed his balls! It saw? You did very well. Red deserved it. He's seeing if he still car, pee. Your slippers. You were perfect. Careful! It's the Gobi! You barely arrived and you're already fighting? It wasn't a fight. I fell. In someone's fist. You'll feel mine if you lie. Tomorrow, go to the laundry! There I left. Arrived early. The principal hasn't arrived yet. - What are you writing? - My complaints. I'll be right back. - You like it here? - Mothballs are cozy. I'm the moth supervisor. - Are you the new kid? - Yes ma'am. He got hurt in the workshop. Trguier. Is that it? Need to sew this hem. - Bring it back when you're done. - Thank you Madam. - 22 sheets. Count right. - Yes ma'am. - Pretty. Isn't it? - Not much.

At least you could help rnel. Shut up! Quick! Corne: - What there was? - Stay quiet. I will trust you. Listen. The door. When go out. I'm going straight to New York. Even if you run away, you will have to arrive at L~ Havre find a ship and board as clandestine. You won't be out of the woods. Who messed up my bed? Mouse. You could have taken off your slippers. Mommy wrote for the dear son? Want to smell? Your mother smells good. Isn't it? What there was? Not my goddamn stepdad will let me go home. He says I need to be tamed. You should have seen me pure wool, tailor-made suits... Leather shoes, also custom made... No kidding! I've heard of tailored suits. But not in shoes' What I feel most I miss my piano. Remember that tomorrow It's my concert. You are the Count of Monte Cristo. - Who? - A guy who was born rich, and was taken to a dungeon for a scoundrel. But he didn't stay there. He escaped by digging a tunnel with a spoon. Nonsense' It wasn't like that! - He dug a tunnel. - No. It went through a wall. - It's the same thing. - Not at all. I read the book. He arrived at a priest's cell, and when the priest died. He took the place of the body. - So what? - The guards threw him overboard. Monte Cristo swam to the surface. And that's how he got away. - Like I said. He got away. - All you think about is running away. - It will end up in a colony. - You only need to stay one year. I need to stay 7 years. I will die first. Asshole' want to end in a penal colony? And you want me to lose my job? Consider yourself lucky because your father died during the? War. If I weren't a veteran... would bust your head like a coconut. Where did you put my keys? Give me back! Give me back my keys! Damn it! Mouse. Are you sleeping? - What do you want? - You stole my atlas? - What? - My Atlas. I don't care much for your Atlas. Attention! The monkey! What is he doing here? Sirs! I don't usually give sermons during meals. But a serious incident leaves me with no option. The food deposit was robbed tonight. The bolts and padlocks they were broken into. Tin cans and feet disappeared. - I hope the culprit turns himself in. - Count on it. The dorms will be searched. Who has hidden food Better watch out! Gentlemen. Do as you wish. If anyone has information, come here. You'll be doing everyone a favor. You have until dinner time to denounce the culprits. He can't forget the sardines! Or else I will order a suitable punishment. Think. Gentlemen. But think about it. Silence! Up! You want to play. Don't you? You rascals! I will take care of you personally. If. And I say 'if do not denounce the thieves u nti I tonight. I will stand and they shall eat with sticks! Now I'm waiting. Bunch of burns: Who do you think you are? I've tamed boys more difficult than you! Miserables! You don't scare me! Emma, close the hall window. Some of you are lucky for they're working out there. But tonight I will take care of you! Sit down! Shit! It's freezing. Do you know where they will end up? In a penal colony! This is what the future reservation for you! Heap of garbage! You have crime in your blood! We can't do anything for you! Now eat! You're makinq a mistake. Boss! Sit down! So I'm committing a mistake. Morand? And which one is it? Children are not born criminals. Neither do we. No child comes into the world bad. If they have problems. They need care. Not a penal colony. As for the others, Parents are responsible if they exist. Yes from the parents! Who refuse to take care of their children! Who pref er to see them arrested! 80% of human beings are conceived by chance. What right do they have to judge us, and calling us murderers? What right? Why society brutalizes the children of those that she sends to die rn war? He finished? - He can't do that. - Don't bother. Two weeks in solitary confinement' Get rid of it! Get that ugly face out of here' Move. Asshole! - Now there will be no concert. - Silence! Attention' All on your feet! Out there in a minute: - What's going on? - Stand up! - Or you'll be dragged out of bed. - It's not 6 o'clock yet. - They don't care. - Shit. Where's my boot? Quick or you'll get hurt. Wear the boots. Not the slippers. - Shit. Where's my boot? - Get out, everyone! Dressed or not. Everyone out there! - Out there! - I can't find my boot. I don't care! It will thicken your feet. - But boss... - It doesn't matter. Out there! - I lost a boot! - Wear your cape. It's freezing. - Is everyone here? - Yes. Boss! Great! Sirs.. pay attention. You have 30 seconds to reveal the names of the culprits, and go straight to bed. However. If they decide do not reveal the names ... I'll be going round here until dawn. Very good! This will be hell you assholes! Trying to be magnanimous! Trying to be smart' I'm not tired! I'm in top shape! See this! See this, You there! Put that head down ! - What are you doing? - I need to pee. Get out right now! Clown! - I need to pee! The scoundrels will be screwed' He will catch. - Who is it? - A guy who couldn't take it anymore. - He needs to pee! - I should have pissed while walking. Listen ! He's doing the concert. At least he's in there. Don't talk nonsense. He was slaughtered. She's still with us. Morand! Silence! Or I make you be quiet! Continues. Cow will collapse before us. You can. We have to get out of here. I still have a year to go, and I have a job of my own wait in the workshop. Quite frankly! What then. Gentlemen? Still don't want to talk? Scoundrels' Fucking crooks! Want to be stubborn? Want to act like men? That's enough. Don't think you've won! They won't escape like this so easily! Hurry up. Boys! Corne on, Gilbert ! Leon ! Hurry, Andre! Where's Trguier? Must be on duty. And if a supervisor shows up. What I say? Check it out. What the hell is he doing? Stop! Stop! - What's this story? - Where did you intend to go? I wamed! Here. I volunteered to make soup today. - What got into you? - I did like Monte Cristo. - I hid in the sheets. - Do it again, and they send you to a colony. Is this what you want? Maybe next time I can. I can't accept like you. It was Molina who gave you away. - Scoundrel! - Is it over. Blondeau? I'm coming. Here. To help you endure. I need to go see Fio. Goodbye... Monte Cristo. Let's go. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! I saved it for you. I won't need it. Save it. Wire. Play a song. Do you really want it? - Play louder. - Shut up. Ready. It's very kind of you to fix it the car on a Sunday. - At least I can leave. - It was nothing. It was just the starter. I've seen more complicated things. Here, it's for you. - I can't... - Accept. He finished ? Can I go on vacation? I'm done. Mr. Director. Ouiet. Adah ! Don't be afraid. She is docile as a sheep. See you later. Ma'am. Gobi has been drinking again. - He is not happy here either. - As you know? He gets drunk every night. Drearninq of Africa. You dream of America. I bet one day I get there. Clear. The director's wife gave it to me. - What about Fio? - I don't know. His mother must have sent a letter. Do you want wine? I don't have time. Here. Lost again. Get out! Get out' A horrible thing... - Spit it out. What is it? - It's the thread... - What did he do? - He he... Help me here! - That's how we found him. - It's true. - We can't trust these pests. - They were all outside. - And where were you? Sleeping? - He was outside too. Who are you to answer by a supervisor? I released Morand's body. What is it? - His piano. Boss. - Piano? Take it all to my office. I liked the boy. I thought he could handle it. We should have guessed. We should have stayed closer to him. - He saw that she rejected him. - His stepfather rejected him. It doesn't matter. That doesn't make it any better. - Don't be so hard. - Do you forgive her? So much money to leave the imprisoned son. Is this normal? A woman who leaves her child here, no good. Just because she's in love by the guy? What she say? 'My dear son... ' Continues. '... we are in Biarritz, your stepdad and me. The weather is great and the sea is very calm. Your stepfather needed a vacation. Overwork has caused you health problems this winter.' What the hell! 'I don't need to say how I miss you. I wanted you to come but your stepfather didn't want to.' Your punishment in solitary she upset him. He says you need of constant surveillance. I know. My dear Marcel. That you understand that it's for your own good. I tried to make him change his mind, but you know him. However. He promised you could come home for Christmas. Don't get angry. My dear son. Four months go by fast. I'll stop here. Let's go out for lunch, and your stepfather started the car. My dear son. A kiss from all my heart. From your mother who loves you and thinks of you. 'From your mother who loves you and thinks of you.' Bitch! She forgot to mention what was the menu. She didn't know he did she have quite an appetite? If there is an I nq ui ry. You can get hurt. Screw the inquiry! Thread won't come back! - If they say... - Too bad ifs not a real rope. I would keep it as an amulet. - Take back what you said. - I hope you're kidding. Watch out, the Gobi has arrived! For God's sake. What is this? It's nothing. It's just an argument. Isn't it. Guys? - That's right. - It's true. - I saw everything. Blondeau... - Shut up! Understand the situation in what do you leave me? I don't know what stops me... Out. Everyone. Quick! Out! - Good morning! - Good morninq. Mrs. Dupray. How are you? Very well. Thank you.

Fio was my friend. Did you call him 'Fio'? Control yourself. A boy like him you cannot console her. I wanted to see where he slept. - Can you follow me? - That's not very sensible. I want to see his bed. I wanted too meet Blondeau. Listen! Listen. These are the parents by Morand. They want to talk to Blondeau. Is he still here? She just went upstairs. Do you want me to go get it? No need. We're going up. Please. My wife regrets not be here. Unfortunately. There was an unforeseen... - Who are they? - Fio's parents. - Who are they? - Flo's parents.

Lonely. Afterwards. Go to Belle-lie. Under police escort. What a shame! He was a good mechanic. What is it now? The Mouse is gone. I mean. Charel. It was just what was missing. Call the police!

I am scared. - What? - No. I'm scared of myself. - Sometimes I feel like killing... - Don't do anything silly! Are you listening? Here. Fio's mother asked that forgive you. You're kidding! It won't change anything. You were right about running away from here. Treguier. Let's lock up! - You're lucky. - Shut up and play. Fio wrote well. - Do you understand all this? - Not always. Damn!
