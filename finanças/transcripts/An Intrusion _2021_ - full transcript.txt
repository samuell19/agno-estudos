Oh, God. What was that? - Becca. - Sam? Call the cops. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Has your daughter ever mentioned anyone following her before? Maybe some threatening calls or text messages? Hey, Rebecca? Has anybody been bothering you? Rebecca? Becca? Has anybody been bothering you at school? Has anything happened strange online? No. Nothing. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight. Sleep well. Becca, what were you doing up, anyway? I was just getting a glass of water. Who's that? It's nothing, it's just Layne calling me. He's calling you at four in the morning? I don't know, Dad. Probably to see if I'm okay. How'd he know something's wrong? Sam, let's just let... - I... - Dad! I'm just gonna tell him not to call so late. Can I have it back? If he calls back, tell him you'll see him tomorrow. Go to bed. - Goodnight, Dad. - Goodnight. What, Joyce? Well done, Sam. After everything she's been through, you still have to do that to her? Why would he be calling so late? She's probably tryna sneak out. Why didn't you tell the police about your car getting broken into last... Because it probably didn't have anything to do with this. It's probably just some neighborhood junkies breaking into cars, or this Layne kid for all we know. Ah, so that's what you're becoming? Stereotypical boyfriend hating dad. I'll start liking her boyfriends when she stops dating losers. This Layne kid just rubs me the wrong way. And why would an 18 year old wanna date a 16 year old, - is beyond me. - Okay, you know what? I cannot have this conversation tonight. When you come to bed, will you please leave the lights on? I gotta be at work in a few hours, anyway. I'll get dressed and get out of here. You're going into work? Call it off. They'll get it. I've got an important presentation this morning. Look, I'll just make it a half day. Okay? Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I love you. So, is that it, Sam? Look, I get it. I understand. And I enjoyed whatever this was. A fling. A mistake, whatever. I knew what I was doing. And it wasn't a mistake. It's just over. So, do you wanna talk about what happened last night? No. To be honest, I'd rather not. Yeah. I get it. I'm sorry, but you gotta clean your car. It stinks so bad. - Are you okay? - Yeah. What happened after the cops got there? - Did they catch the guy? - No. They told my dad they'd let us know if there were any other break-ins. They just sat outside all night. Why? Are they gonna sit outside tonight too? I don't know. Maybe? Maybe I could come over after school. I don't think that's gonna be a good idea. Come on. I'm freezing! Morning, Sam. Morning. - Hey, bud. What's up? - Hey. Morning, Chris. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. No, that's okay. I'm just... still a little jumpy from this morning. Yeah. Joyce called me on the drive this morning, and filled me in. You guys gonna be okay? Yeah, I think we'll be good. You know, the police are doing their thing. They're just searching for a lead. How's Becca? She's shaken up, but she's tough. You know, I think she'll be okay. She's a tough cookie, that one. A true badass, just like her mom. Well, you just make sure to take care of my sister and my niece, there. You got it, chief. One more thing. This weekend. It's Aaron's baptism on Sunday. You guys still...? Yeah. Of course, Chris. Okay. Well, you let me know if you need anything, and I'll be seeing you in the meeting. Alright. I will see you in there. Hey. Hey, hon. You talked to Chris yet this morning? Yeah. Actually, he was just in here. Okay. I didn't want to give him an answer until after I had talked to you about it. What did you tell him? I said we'd be there. You sure? - Cause we don't have to go. - Joyce, look. It's your brother's kid, alright? We'll make it work. You promise you're okay with it? Yeah. I mean, the only thing we have left is the mess in the kitchen. Actually, I got most of it cleaned up already. - Really? - Yeah. A little too slow to the draw there, slick. You can make it up to me if you pick up dinner on the way home, okay? Love you. Becca, I'm sorry, but your car stinks so bad. God. It smells like something's dead. It's worse than it was this morning. Look to see if there's anything on the floor. Okay. No. No, I don't see anything. There's nothing down here that can smell like that. - That smells like death. - God. What the hell is that? I can't do this. Can you pull over? Okay. Okay, fine. Just give me a second. Oh, God. Hey, Bec. What's up? Mom? Bec? What's going on? Just tell me what happened. Did you tell anyone? - Why would I do that? - Did you? Believe it or not, it's not worth screwing my life up either, okay? I got pictures of us sent to me this morning. What? Someone emailed me pictures of us in your apartment this morning. Did they say or want anything? No. You don't think that she would hire a private investigator, do you? No. I don't think that's what this is. Look, I just wanna forget about this. I just made a mistake. What? Look, I have to go. Alright? Just be cautious. I think you're the one that needs to be cautious, Sam. Jesus, Bec. Are you okay? When would they have put it in there? Last night or maybe today at school? Has Layne been messing with you? Okay, Dad. Yeah, he broke in too, and tried to kill me. Why the fuck would he put a deer in my car? Hey, watch your mouth! Hey, both of you, stop it! You're making a scene in the middle of a police station. Honey, why don't you go check on Melanie? I just saw her walk in the lounge with her mom and dad, okay? Okay. - Becca, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Hey, who's that? She's a detective. She talked to us when we first got here. She wants to talk to you, too. Me? Why? Mr. Hodges? I'm Detective Savannah Simpson. May I speak with you in my office? Yeah. Have a seat. So, did you need another report on what happened last night? I wanted to ask, in your opinion, if you think that your daughter might have a stalker? Rebecca? Or an ex-boyfriend that ever was a problem? You think Rebecca has a stalker? Or maybe you? In my opinion, this person went through a lot of trouble to break in, only to steal nothing, and to secretly open Rebecca's car and leave a dead animal inside. No notes. No threats. Which is why I wanted to ask you if you think you might have any enemies, or someone who might be upset with you. Well, I did get an email this morning. An email? Yeah. Someone talking about my house in a suspicious way. Really? Did it say anything else? Can you send me this email? No. I deleted it. You deleted it? Yep. Any reason why? Well, it just freaked me out a little bit, and just wanted to forget about it. Okay. Well, maybe we can log into your email and you can archive it from there. No, you can't. No? I cleared the trash bin. And there's a lot of sensitive work material, so... Was that wrong of me? No. No, it's okay. Just gonna make my job a little harder. Yeah, sorry about that. Well, if you do get another one, can you please send it to me? May be our only shot at catching this guy. Thank you. Becca? Rebecca? Hey, open up real quick. What, Dad? Is someone in here with you? What? What was that? Go to our room. Shouldn't you call the cops? No, not yet. I'm gonna go check it out. Tell your mother what's going on. Go, go, go. Why the hell wouldn't we call the police? Sam, what is it? Hang on a minute! Damn. What the hell is this? You miserable little cocksucker. - Rebecca? - Dad? - Sam, what is going on? - Was someone in your room? - What? - Was Layne in your room? Sam, what happened outside? Someone broke in my car. It's probably just kids. Is there anything else? Lock the door. Call the police. Tell them what's going on. Mom? It's okay. It's okay. I have a gun, you piece of shit! Oh, you think that's funny? No gun, huh? Fuck you! Fucking... So this is what it's come to? He knows we don't have guns in the house. And he knows how to get in and out the house before the cops get here. Why don't we just move? Because this is my fucking house! And I'm not gonna get run out by some fucking sewer rat. Somebody jealous of something that I have! What we have. This? This is our house. Our life. - Joyce. - Don't you ever raise your voice to me like that again. Now, I am well aware you have mentally checked out these last few months. So let me be very clear to you that this marriage takes two people and our daughter has two parents. At least for this Christmas. Joyce. Hey, Joyce? Joyce? What? Who is it? Mr. Hodges, it's Detective Savannah Simpson. Your wife said it would be okay to come by and speak with you. Hang on. Give me a second. May I come in? Yeah, sure. Guess you want some water, whiskey, anything? No, it's okay. On duty. I used to always take the option of not working. Well, to be honest, I spend a good chunk of my day in the office. It's the only way I can unwind on my day off, given the situation. I understand that, Mr. Hodges. No, please call me Sam. Okay. So, we have the stories from the reports the officers took last night. But I wanted to talk more about what we were discussing at the station. Sure. Go ahead. Well, before it was a theory. Now I think it's almost certain whoever's doing this knows you, or all of you. I wanted to know if you thought any more about any enemies that you might have. Or any older men that might've been an issue to Rebecca in the past? Well, there is this boy that goes to my daughter's school. I think they're dating. Layne Lewis, right? She mentioned him. What'd she say about him? Usual stuff high school girls say about boys they like. Yeah. Anyway, that's him. Is there any specific reason why you get a bad feeling about him? Mom, I don't need it. ...for Christmas? Hey, Savannah. Mom says I need to wear a warmer coat. Yes, you do. This is Layne. Hey, Layne. Why don't you wait here while she gets her coat? Hey, Mr. Hodges. Would you like some coffee, Savannah? Oh, no, I'm... - just about to leave. - Oh, okay. So if we could... discuss further about what you mentioned. You need specifics? It would help. I'm ready. There's some Christmas cookies in the kitchen if you want. Do not let me forget to pick up something for the baptism, okay? You got it. I'm so sorry we have to go. But my week is free if you have any questions later. Yeah. It's okay, life happens. Thank you so much for what you're doing. Bye, hon. So you mentioned Layne Lewis because you actually suspect him, right? I'm sorry? This isn't you just not liking your only daughter's boyfriend, right? You actually believe that it could be him? Okay. I'll look further into it. In the meantime, we'll have a scout who will spy on the sub division. Just in case. Twelve gauge, huh? Yeah, you can't be too careful. You ever shot a firearm before? Is that required to own one? No. Not at all. Well, I'll look further into what we discussed. I'll be in touch. Does your dad, like... not like me? I know. I'm so sorry. Why? It's not you. He's just been acting... What? I don't know. He's just been acting weird lately. It's been like that for a few months now. I've never seen my parents fight this much. Why are they fighting? I mean, I tried listening in on their arguments, but they always wait until I fall asleep. I don't know. I think it's to do with his job. Does your dad ever get, like... mean? - Or...? - No. The most he's ever done was just yell a couple times. But I just think he's shutting off. - Emotionally? - No, just as a dad. What is it? Why did you call off at work today? - Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. Look, I told you. We're not talking outside of work. - But I thought... - Hey, Chris is calling me. I gotta go. Look, don't call me again. Hey, Chris. What's going on? Hey, brother. You guys doing anything for dinner tonight? No. No plans yet. So I'm arguing with the cashier, telling her there is no reason my card should not be working. And on the fifth try, still convinced that she's the idiot with the broken card reader, I finally look down, and I see that Chris has been putting in the wrong pin over and over! Woman, you're so fucking stupid sometimes. Now, had you given me the credit card instead of the debit card, we wouldn't have even had this whole going off on a tirade on some 18 year old cashier. "Can I see your manager?" She's always so spicy, this one. Speaking of going off on a tirade, did you hear what happened today at the office? No. You know that... what's her name, the new paralegal, Julia Hilt? I've seen her around. Well, she was caught... texting in one of the most important meetings. Oh, are you kids not allowed cellphones in the office? Well, we had a really important client today at the office. And her face, right into the glass. I don't know. Social media. Doing something, whatever. So, privately, Mike comes up to her, with respect, excuses themselves into the hallway. Tries to explain the situation. Of course, she's not having it. He's getting closer, trying to calm her down. As soon as he barely even touches her, she screams. "Get your fucking hands off me, Mike! "Get your fucking hands off me!" The guy's red in the face embarrassed. She's freaking crazy. Is this normal? I mean, normal behavior for her? No, she's just some new paralegal in the office. She's a total wackjob. Have you talked to her before, then? No. No, I just... I've heard of her around the office, you know? Coffee talk. You're a gossiper, then? Guilty! You gotta try one of these. It's Bec. Hi, hon. What do you mean you're still at home? What happened to your plans with Mel? Well, I wish you had called us sooner. You know we don't want you home right now. Yes. Becca, yes. We trust you. You know exactly why... Alright. Yeah, we're gonna head back right now. Love you. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just... Becca's plans with her friends got canceled today so she's been home alone, and I don't like that. Okay. Yeah. Well, you guys... No, no. We'll see you guys at the baptism. Okay. Well, are you two sure you're okay to drive? Yeah. I've only had one, but she's... Why don't you fuck me anymore? What? We used to do it all the time. Even in the car. Remember how I used to suck your dick when you'd drive us home from the movies? Come on. Come on. Come on. Take your pants off. - Come on. - Stop. - Honey! - Stop it. I miss when you'd jump in the shower with me. The way you'd slap my ass. How many wives are begging their husbands for that? I'm okay. Thank you. - What was that? - Becca? It sounded like it was out back. Should we call the police? No. Get in the car, call Becca and make sure she's okay. No. I'm gonna go check on Becca. Get in the car. Call Rebecca. It's probably just her shutting a window or something. Becca? Becca? Come on, you bastard. Mom? Is everything okay? You scared the shit out of me. You okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Did something happen? No. No, it's fine, okay? Okay. Let's see who you are, huh? You son of a bitch. I knew it. - Hey. - Hey. Becca didn't hear anything. - What happened to you? - Oh... Chasing a raccoon off the back porch, and... I slipped. And also, I remembered I left my phone at the bar. So I gotta go get it. I can call Chris. Maybe he's still there. No, no, no. Don't. They have a kid at home and they gotta get back. I'll just be a little bit. - Okay. - You gonna be okay? Yeah. No, we'll be fine. - Okay, honey. - Okay. Love you. Hey brother, I'll see you this weekend. Alright. We'll see you there. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Hello? Hello. I'm trying to reach a Sam Hodges. Is this him? - Who is this? - This is Officer Lang at Lake P.D. Detective Simpson is having me call to ask you to come in and answer some questions. What, now? Yes, sir. She's going to need you right now. Savannah, Sam Hodges is here for you. Thank you. Have a seat. Alright, so what's this about? First off, how are Joyce and Rebecca doing? They're doing pretty good, but it's been a stressful week. One that won't end, will it? I guess not. So, about the young man we were discussing. - Layne? - Yeah. Did you look into him? The only problem with that, Sam, his mother reported him missing this morning. Becca didn't mention anything about that. Have you seen her yet today? Not since she left for school. Cause we called her after we heard this. And his mother seems to believe that he went to go see her last night. No. He doesn't come by the house at night. Yeah, I assumed as much. That's what Rebecca said, but I don't know. She already seemed... upset and stressed. I'm sorry? Well, after we talked to Rebecca, we talked to one of his closest friends, and he also said Layne was supposed to go to your house last night. And apparently he didn't show up. Much to your disapproval, I'm sure. The hell does that mean? I don't know, just the way you described him the last time we communicated. Didn't seem like you had the highest opinion of him. Yeah, I don't think I can talk about this until I speak to my lawyer. Why? You're not being detained or brought in as a suspect. Yeah, but you did ask me to come in. To verify that he hadn't stopped at your house last night. No, he did not come by my house, and even if he did, I wouldn't let him in. Are you sure about that, Sam? Are we done here? I have to get back to my family. We're wrapping presents tonight. Yeah, you can go. You're free. I'd bundle up, Mr. Hodges. It's coming down out there. Hey, baby. Good afternoon, Sam. Hello? How are things over there at the police station? Any interesting developments? What are you doing in my house, and where's Joyce? She's just enjoying a warm bath right now. Don't worry. I won't have a peak. You don't mind if I poured myself a glass of whiskey while I'm here, right? Look, I don't know what the fuck you want, but you got about 15 seconds to get out of my house. Or what, Sam? All I have to do is leave this envelope right here with me in front of the bathroom door on my way out. A few snapshots. One's from last night, and a few more spicy favorites I haven't shown you yet. Get out of my house! That temper's going to get the best of you one day, Sam. I want you to clear your schedule for this evening and take a rain check on wrapping those presents. We're helping Rebecca pick out an outfit for tomorrow's baptism, because you and I are going to meet up for a date. And why the hell would I do that? Maybe I'd just like to sort some things out. Sanctuary Club on Bennett. Nine. - Look, I'm not... - You know, it sound like Joyce might be finishing up her little soak right now. Are we going to be meeting, or am I leaving this envelope here? I'll be there. I'll find you, Sam. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! God! - Everything okay over there? - What do you want? Oh, sorry. My car... And, you know... arguing with my wife. That guy looks like he's ready to pop. You know what's funny? That's the guy from Simpson's home invasion case. Who, the homeowner? Yeah, him. She's having me look into a few things on that guy. Is he a suspect? Get the feeling she's starting to think that way at least. Well, I can't imagine why. That guy looks like he's about one bad day away from stepping into traffic. You know, out of curiosity, I've been looking at statistics of stalker and break-in cases to see how often someone from the home or family is involved. How's that going for you? Not good. Pretty useless rabbit hole, to be honest. Check this out. D.O.J. numbers show there's almost 270,000 home invasions a year. And there's over 1.3 million victims that annually report having a stalker. Jesus Christ. Do you know what the statistics don't tell you, Castillo? What's that? How many of those people deserved it. There's that element. You're right. There's that element. He still hasn't texted you back yet? No. His phone just goes to voicemail now. Derek say anything? No, he said the same thing. He said Layne hasn't gotten ahold of him. I mean, he snuck out my window last night when my parents got home. Maybe his phone's just dead. - Mel? - What? Do you wonder if your parents are capable of killing someone? What? You ever think your parents are just so damn boring that they pretend that everything's okay when it's actually not? I don't know. Probably not my parents. If anything, they're probably just guilty of being into some weird, kinky shit. But what? Like, you think your mom's a serial killer or something? - How much? - Five bones. Just you, or you waiting on someone? Just me. Keep the change if you just say you never saw me. I'll take it to my grave, bud. You here for the band? Just meeting someone. Your funeral, pal. Hey, what you drinking? - Just give me water. - Sure. Actually, Crown on the rocks, please. Sure. Sam? You stand out like a sore thumb. What's this? Why the hell are you here? Are you here for me? I need to talk to you. - I gotta get out of here. - What? I need to talk to you. Outside. Jesus. It's fucking freezing out here, Sam. - What do you want? - Are you involved in this? - Don't yell at me. - Are you a part of this? A part of what, Sam? The stalker that keeps messing with me. Told me to come here tonight and meet him. Why would you do that? Because I need to try to end this. So why don't you just call the cops? Because I can't. Well, if you're not going to, maybe I have to. Hey, no. Don't call the cops. I need to try to end this on their terms. - I can't lose my family. - You give a shit about them? You know what? Now it's my turn to tell you this. Leave me the fuck alone, and don't follow me! I'm not following... Hey. Hey! You come around me and my family again, I'm gonna end your fucking life! Thank you, Deborah, for that lovely rendition. Y'all, wasn't that beautiful? Now, before we continue with our Christmas service, on the Eve of little Baby Jesus' birthday, I wanna remind you that one of our own is about to have her little boy baptized, to join us in union with the Holy Spirit. Now, I wanna remind you what that means, that word baptism, to us Christian folk. Why? Why do we, as parents, have our little ones baptized? Why do we lay their tiny heads in the water, and sometimes scare them, while we anoint them with the holy water? We baptize because our souls are thirsty. So we give it a drink of that water. That water, being what it is, that we desire from the Lord, and what the Lord will promise to give us in return. - He's right. - That's right, minister. Matthew 28:19. Jesus says, "Go and make disciples of all of your nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost." You see? It washes the spiritually dead and blind, and protects us from the enemies of God. We get it done to us when we're little boys and girls, because it isn't a contract. It doesn't need consent from both parties. That's not what baptism is, y'all. It is simply God's promise to us. But it's not magic. Is it magic, y'all? No. Because we have the freedom to deny that promise, that love. We are given the opportunity to turn away. Like a marriage that's broken. One where there is no love. There is no salvation where there is no faith. But where there is baptism, and where there is faith, there is promise of salvation. - Amen. - Amen. Amen indeed, y'all. But there is a current member of our family who's suffering, everyone. So before we welcome in another, let us take a moment to heal one of our own. Little Miss Margaret has recently been released from the hospital, after she was burned in her home's kitchen while preparing supper. Now, as she has confessed, and as she told all of us a few months back, Margaret stepped outside of her marriage. She committed adultery. But we forgive her. Oh, we forgive her and we love her, because she repented and she asked for forgiveness, and the Lord in return forgives her and loves her. So when we pray for little Margaret's painful healing of her body to begin, we are also gonna pray for her soul. 'Cause I don't believe this was just an accident, Margaret. I truly do not. I don't think this was just a matter of some grease catching fire. I think the Lord sensed that... even though you had repented, you were thinking of going down that path of sin again. Am I wrong, Margaret? Shh. I know. I know. And the Lord knew it. And I truly think... that he placed the demon Wrath in you, and he caused that fire. And he caused that pain to remind you of the fire and pain that awaits you should you ever turn against Him again. Because no matter how painful flames upon the flesh may feel, it's the flames that await our soul, should we turn on Him, that we must fear! So we're not just praying for her body to heal. We're gonna cast a demon Wrath out. I mean it. Do you hear me in there, demon? You're no longer welcome here. You leave this God-fearing woman and you take that sin with you! You take that sin back to hell with you! And you take any adulterer in this room and you take them back to those lakes of fire! Go on. You take those sinners and you leave! Go on! Get! Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. - Leave. - Leave! - Leave. - Leave. - Leave. - Leave. - Leave. - Leave. - Leave! - Leave. - Leave! - Leave! - Leave! - Leave! Leave! And Our Lord has delivered our sister back to us all. She is here to stay. Now, let us welcome our sister back to us, shall we? I'll see you next week, Minister. See you then, brother. - Thank you. - You play one hell of an electric guitar probably, right? Seriously, Terri's been trying to bring me into the fold, and full disclosure, I gotta tell you I've been looking forward to the whole snakes and serpents kind of, fire and brimstone thing. I'd love to introduce you to my sister and my niece. Well, she's actually a foster sister, so you can take it easy on her. Certainly, we're always thrilled to watch our little family grow. Hey, guys. I'd like to introduce you to... - Father... - Minister. Minister Fairfield. So you guys wanna go grab breakfast? - Yeah. Sounds good to me. - Tammy's up the street. Steak and eggs special on Sundays. - Chris? - Yeah, babe? Merry Christmas, Sam. - Who grabbed my shoulder? - What? Did you see who grabbed my shoulder? No, it's probably someone just saying bye. Hey, kid. I got a really stupid question. Did you break that hand, or did you lose any fingers? What I'm trying to ask you, is your hand broken? Do you have all your fingers, is what I'm tryna ask. - It's just broken. - Oh. Okay. Well, can I see it? Your hand. Let me see your hand. Merry Christmas. Did you grab my shoulder over there? - No. - Do we have a problem? No, there's no problem. I'm just trying to see your kid's fingers. Excuse me? I just wanna see if he has all his fingers. Yeah, he's got all his fingers, man. Just let me see...! Are you a psychopath? Listen, I... No, shut up for a goddamn second, Sam! I'm sure you know at this point you just elevated yourself to chief suspect, Sam. Me calling in favors? Because I'm looking for the guy that's been stalking us. He attacked me last night, and in the fight, he lost two fingers and then he ran off. - What? Where? - It was after work last night. And then in there, someone grabbed my shoulder and said my name. And he was missing fingers. You're either not keeping us in the loop, or you're being really fucking creative. Now, which one is more suspicious? Look, it was last night, and I was gonna come in after church today. Did you get a good look at him? No, nothing. Well, good news for you, the boy's father sounds like he's not gonna press charges. I advise you consider doing the same. Just chalk it up to holiday stress. No more secrets. Have a good Christmas, Sam. What a beautiful ceremony. Becca. No, I think we'll definitely remember that one. Enough. I get it. Do you, Dad? Do you know what it was like for Mom and I to have to stand there and watch you run around like a serial killer? Do I look like a serial killer to you? What we doing? Can we just go home? Stay here. Or what? Or your crazy fucking dad is gonna chop you up in a thousand pieces. Stay here. Joyce, I'm sorry. They were at the house again, weren't they? So you walking into a door and smashing your eye, that was all just bullshit? Why'd you lie about it? - Because I was afraid... - Who has reason to be messing with us? Do you owe someone money? You think this is my fault now? What I think is that when you went back to the bar to get your cell phone, you were gone an awful long time. What happened this last year, Sam? I keep going over it in my head. The days and the months, and... I just can't figure out where... whatever this is, where it started. I still love you. I promise I do. But I know something has been going on. And it started before all of this craziness. I have my suspicions. But I hated myself for feeling them. I mean, how could I think that about you? It's what I tell myself... alone at night, wondering where you are. I think... what I was most afraid of, though, was if... I was right and I confronted you and I made you stop doing whatever it was you were doing. And I would lose you completely. So I just swallowed my pride and I looked the other way, and I convinced myself this is just something that marriages go through. Something we would go through. You would realize you were making a mistake, and we would just move past it. You see, Sam... I love you so much... that I removed myself from the picture. And I just hope that I'm worth coming back to when you're finished. But I can't do it. I can't do it anymore. I can't sit in the dark. I can't. It's torture, and it has got to stop. So... is there someone else? There was. There was someone else. You're not crazy. I'm sorry! - Who is it? - What does it matter? Who is it? It's a girl at work. Her name is Julia. The crazy one? You know what the worst part of it is? You thought I was so dumb, you didn't even try not to be obvious. She's too stupid. She'll never figure it out. You think that fucking little of me. Look, it's over. I ended it. Look at me. It's you. I love you. You expect me to believe that? Hey! I want you to hear what daddy has done. Becca! Becca! Look at me! No. I'll always be able to find a way back in. Becca! Becca! Becca! Stop, please! Where you going, Rebecca? I still want you to hear this. Now I have a gun. - Sam! - Dad, dad! Oh, Becca. Becca! Are you okay? Let me see. Oh, quit being a baby. Do me a favor. Let me check your eyesight. Look straight ahead at me. Okay. You didn't lose any consciousness when he hit you? - No. - Okay. Alright. I think everybody's fine. If you guys... Who are you? And why are you here? - Okay? Thank you. - Thank you. Wait. Before you leave, do any of you guys recognize him? No. What's his name? There's not a wallet. There's no identification. Nothing on him. Why, Sam? You recognize him? No. No, I don't know who he is. Alright, well, we're gonna John Doe this guy. We'll get his prints. Blood at the lab. I'm sure he's in the system. Yeah, you guys can go. We'll get out of here pretty quick once we get all the photos we need. And you guys can hire someone to get this cleaned up. I know it's a shitty way to spend the holidays. Look, Sam, I wanted to apologize. You gotta admit, you didn't make it easy on us. You know, all of this and poking around. See if we can figure out the fuck this guy is. Maybe he had something to do with Layne Lewis. You've got some tough girls. Yeah, they are. So, what are you guys gonna do? Stay at a hotel? No, I think we're just gonna drive ourselves to the hospital and stay at the in-laws'. Try and save Christmas. Sounds good. It's gonna be a pretty wide investigation for a few days. Look, I'll try to give you guys some time. - Contact you after New Year's. - Thank you. Do you remember the Christmas we spent at the hotel when I was eight? When we moved? Yeah. The reservation got screwed up at the nice place with the pool. So Dad had to get us a new place at the motel down the street. I thought that was the worst Christmas ever. I don't know. I remember you guys told me that we wouldn't get any presents that year, because Santa wouldn't be able - to find us. - Right. But when I woke up, you guys had set all the presents out. Then we opened them on the twin beds before going downstairs to eat pancakes and waffles. Nuts and chocolate chip. Yeah. Then we watched Christmas movies all day in our PJs. You know... When I think about Christmas, that's the year I actually think of. Let's hope that's the Christmas you always think of, sweetie. Yeah. You look like shit. Aww, thank you. I want a fresh start this year. Can we do that? I'd like that. I just wish your mom let your dad keep booze around here, you know? I'm so sick of having eggnog. Where's my scotch? I doubt if anything's open, though. It's still early. That liquor store on Union? It's still open. Well, I think you should go get us something. What if your mom catches us? Then we'll have to do what we did when we were teenagers and we'll just have to hide it. Okay. - One more thing. - Name it. Swing by Charlie's and get us some pizza. Their kitchen's open tonight 'til 2. Okay. Alright, darling. I shall return. Love you. I ordered a pizza about 15 minutes ago. Yeah, I was hoping you wouldn't get here so quickly. Burned that one. They're making a new one for you. It'll just be a second, man. Just grab a seat. Maybe grab a drink. It'll be right out. Yeah, let me get a whiskey - and a glass of ice, please. - Sure. Can I help you? No, it's nothing. I'm just... relieved to see you putting that ice on your face, instead of ruining a perfect glass of whiskey with it. That's all. Hey, I'm sorry. What are you drinking? What am I drinking? Whatever this place's cheapest scotch is. Hey, bartender. Get him another scotch. You didn't have to do that. Top shelf. I appreciate it. You look like you could use another round, and you didn't say "no thank you." Well, my mom always said to not let my pride get in the way of a kind gesture. Pleasure to meet you. Sam. Devon. You try giving the cat a bath or something? Come again? Oh. Oh. It's been a hell of a week. Well, I hope it's getting better for you. Things are looking up after tonight. Some good news come with those cuts, then? Yeah. They represent a fresh start, you could say. And that's definitely something I can give my family for Christmas. Well, they say simple gifts usually resonate the most with family. Well, if you have a wife. I'm not quite ready for that road yet. Keeping things simple for the holidays, right? I suppose that's a more cheerful way to look at it. Maybe if I was ready to settle down, I'd appreciate an easy life, but I have no... Marriage shouldn't be in your cards if that's what you're hoping for. Really? Any advice for it, then? Yeah. Find somebody that you love more than your friends, your hobbies, your top shelf scotch. You gotta be willing to give up everything for that person. Well, that's what you did? I married someone I loved just as much as all those things. When you first meet someone, they come into your life, and you don't think about what it's like you coming into theirs. But eventually, you're gonna have to choose. You're gonna have to choose between... the life that you had, and your life with them. And you'll see other people do it, and you tell yourself that's not me. That's not gonna be us. Then you'll feel selfish for living both lives. But here's the truth. Finding someone you're not gonna resent for forcing you to make that choice. Merry Christmas. So, is there a woman in your life that knows you're at a bar at Christmas getting marital advice? That's funny. No, no, no. Not me. Nope. Nope, nope, nope. You see, my sense of romance has always been a bit stinted. I had this one friend when I was younger. He met this girl when we were kids. You know, he fell in love with her. And all he could do is talk about her. You'd swear he'd never seen the stars before seeing her eyes, you know? She thought the world of him. But years after they were married, before they ever had a chance to have kids, he got killed in a wreck. No goodbyes, no farewells. He just never came home from work one night. She always kept his name. Never remarried. Even after years and years. She always kept his name and always wears his ring. She'll always be his, no matter what. You see, that right there, that's my idea of a romance, of devotion. Now good luck telling that warm hearted story to someone and then not scare them off, right? Fuck. Is it always so bleak in here? Just during the holidays. It's actually a good place to bring somebody if you just wanna have a good time. Oh, yeah? Friends or wives? Something in between. You know, that choice you mentioned earlier when you did have to choose, would you ever settle on a compromise, or did you choose something more convenient? To be honest, I didn't choose either. I took the easy way out. Did it help? Made me feel worse. And I knew it wouldn't fix things to stop or go back, so I just kept going. They say hindsight's always 20/20, right? So going back was never an option? Not for me. It hasn't been. That's because you're running from something. I don't run. Don't lie to yourself like that. You've been running for a long time. Afraid your responsibilities have anchored you down. Afraid something one day might catch up. How's Rebecca handling everything? She's scared. She's still scared. And your wife? And your wife? She's strong. How'd you know I'd be here? You're predictable, Sam. You follow the same routine. You listen to the same radio stations. You take the same way to work at the same time every morning. Now, I was here the night you came with your brother- and sister-in-law. I've sat in here and watched you drink until close several times right over there. Creature of habit. What if I make a scene? That would be stupid of you. There's clearly a plan in place, Sam, and you know that. Let me ask you a question, Sam. Why didn't you come clean with the first piece of leverage anyone had on you? Before you killed someone to protect it? Like I said, a creature of habit. Tell me what to do next. You come with me quietly in my car right now. Then we drive back to your house. The police are already gonna be there, and so are your daughter and wife. Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry. Her parents weren't hurt. You know, we'll just... We'll just drive over there and, shit, you can tell them everything, Sam. You can tell them fucking everything. You can tell them how we broke into your house, stalked Rebecca, and you can even tell them how we're the ones who killed her boyfriend when it's all over. What do you think about that? What do you get in return for that? Come on. ♪ Deck the halls With boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la ♪ Why are we doing this? You're just gonna kill me when we get there anyway. I can 100% assure you, if you do everything I say, it won't happen. You went to Oakridge University, yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. You knew Molly Adwaller, didn't you? That's what this is about? Just lower the gun. Hey, you got us here. Lower the gun. I need you to lower the gun. Hey, hey! Who's this guy? What's his name? Let's see your hands. - Hands up! - Show me your hands! Woah, woah, woah, woah! Freeze, or I'll blow your fucking brains out. Okay! Easy, easy, easy. I want you all to put your fucking guns down now! Want us to lower the guns? - Put them down! - Okay, okay. Put the guns down. Look at me. Just you and me here. You're the one who brought us here. What are your demands? For you to shut the fuck up and listen! Okay, okay! Okay, we're listening. Listening to what? I want y'all to listen to Mr. Hodges here. He's got a story I'd like for him to tell all of you. Right, Sam? - There was a girl... - So they can hear you! Name was Molly. She was at OU. It was a party. I was so drunk. Tell the fucking story. Sam! She kept wanting to leave, but I don't know why, I followed her to the bathroom and... my friends held the door shut. I didn't wanna scare her. I just wanted to make her feel bad for making me look like a creep in front of everybody for just asking her out on a fucking date! I don't remember what she said that pissed me off, - but I hit her. - Louder! I beat her up! I beat her up until she was unconscious. - Then I fucked her. - Raped her. - I raped her! I raped her! - Say it! And she took it to the school. But all my friends said I wasn't at the party. And my family lawyer charged her with perjury and defamation of character. Then she left. And we forgot. She didn't forget. She didn't forget. She never forgot about you, Sam. Every man that fucked her, she remembered. She fought a terrible fight. Dragging three sons from different men along the way. Her parents had rejected their Catholic daughter fallen from grace! Her friends, she... There were no friends. Only empty pill bottles and us. Three young boys. Starving. Regretting we couldn't feed our mother! One of her suicide attempts eventually was successful. And she left three parentless children to the state. Three! But we knew one man better than the father we never met, and that was you, Sam. You see, she always told us about you. And we promised ourselves one day we would find you. You know what she never told us though, Sam? Our oldest brother, Corey, the one you shot last night... ...she never did tell us who his dad was. Officers... my brother and I are very sorry.
