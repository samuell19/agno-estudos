(gentle festive music) - It's another Christmas, and here I am again. Oh yeah successful, yet single. No, and I'm not in the Christmas spirit at all. - [Monica] Miss Moore! - Now I'm going on another date that I might have to pay for. - Miss Moore! - On the way, and I'm trying to get there. Rude. Everybody is in my way today. (upbeat festive music) - [Blythe] Are you there yet? I've been calling you. - I'm trying to get there, Blythe. I just left work. - [Blythe] Please be nice to him. Do not scare him away like you've done to others. E is for Elle, not Ebenezer. (Elle speaking foreign language) - [Blythe] Okay so his name is Wesley, he's a really nice guy, and he should be waiting right by the bar. - That's the same thing you said about the others, but we'll see. - [Blythe] Just trust me on this one. - Okay Blythe, well, I'm here now. - [Blythe] I'm super excited! - I can't believe I'm another date my cousin has arranged. - [Blythe] This date you might enjoy, so relax. - All right, Blythe. Well, I'm about to walk inside the restaurant. - [Blythe] Okay, I can't wait to hear about your date. - Okay, talk to your later. - [Blythe] Enjoy your date! - Bye. (gentle festive music) Excuse me. Are you Wesley? - I'm afraid not, but I can be. - Oh please, not a chance. - Another date, Miss Moore? - Yes. This makes, what? Date number seven this month? - Like more so 15, but who's counting? - Right. That last date I was on was horrible. You saw it? - Yeah, I did. - I ended up having to pay for my meal and his. - Well hey, hopefully this date will be better than any of your dates in the past. - I hope so, but we'll see. - Hey, we will. What are you drinking in the meantime? Your usual beverage? (speaking foreign language) - You know it. - [Ali] All right, be right up. - Thank you. (people chattering) - Excuse me, are you Elle? - And you are? - I'm Wesley Saxon, nice to meet you. - Why are you late, Mr. Saxon? - I do apologize, Miss Moore. My meeting ran a little longer than expected. So I'll understand if you don't wanna continue with our afternoon. This is for you. Forgive me for being a few moments late. - So what, you just think all women just love roses? Roses are not my favorite flower. - Okay. So what are your favorite flowers, Miss Moore? - Tulips. - Note taken. May I? (keyboard tapping) So how was your day? - My day was long and stressful, and what are you doing? - Powering off my phone. - Why? - Why? I like to focus on our conversation. - But what if your job calls you? - Oh, no worries. My assistant takes care of all of that. Besides, he knows my schedule, and he knows I'm out of the office. - I wouldn't do that. - It's fine, trust me. So you were telling me about your day. - Yes, my day was long and stressful, and I still have so much work to do once I leave here. - Well, I hope tomorrow's better for you. - I hope so too. So, I'm curious, Mr. Saxon. - Please, call me Wesley. And what were you curious about? - What do you do? Your job. Blythe didn't tell me much about you. - I was an athlete before my injury. The league offered me a position, so I started working as a manager for a team in the area. You? - I'm an investment adviser. - Nice. So are you from here? I'm from Maryland. What about you? - South Carolina. - South Carolina? - Yeah. - So how do you and my cousin Blythe know each other then? - Cousins? You and Blythe are cousins? - Yes. - Blythe never mentioned you guys were cousins. She mentioned that you were beautiful, and I agree. So you and Blythe are cousins. - Yes, she is my only cousin. I do have a sister, but she just relocated to the UK last month. - The UK? So you ladies have any plans, maybe going back and forth to the UK? - Oh, no, no, no. I don't have any plans for Christmas, and I won't be going to England yet. But I'm sure Blythe is gonna wanna do something. - And why not? - Christmas just hasn't been the same for me. It's just not a big deal to me anymore. - That's the opposite from my family. - Really? - Oh my god, yes. Every year we've got this big Saxon Christmas fest, and this year my mom's gonna host at home. - Really? - Yeah absolutely. - Oh excuse me, I have to take this call. - Certainly. - Hello. Yes. Yes, I sent the files last week. Okay, so have them handle it, I have to go. Okay, bye-bye. - Is everything okay? - Yes, sorry about that. So you were saying? - Basically every year my family goes really big during this time of year. Have you seen this documentary? - No. Who is he? - [Wesley] Coach Staff Watson. A legendary basketball coach from South Carolina. - Oh. Was he your coach? - My mentor. He taught me a lot when I was a basketball player. Do you ball? - Do I what? - Do you ball? Do you play basketball? (Elle laughing) - No. Fun doesn't exist in my life at the moment. - And why not, Miss Moore? - Because I work a lot, many hours, and the last thing you'll ever see me doing is playing basketball. Do I ball? No. (phone buzzing) Excuse me, I have to take this. Elle Moore speaking. Okay, okay, have them to wait, I'll be there in five minutes. Okay. - Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. Saxon, but as you can see, I am needed in the office. - I see. Well, maybe we can meet again sometime. - Maybe. I really need to get going. Let me pay for this. - Elle. Elle, I'll take care of it. I got it. - You're gonna pay for mine? - Yes. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - It was my pleasure. And it was nice to meet you. Merry Christmas, Elle. - Nice to meet you too. - Did you change your mind? - Forgot my coat. - Miss Moore left. - Yeah, she had to get back to work. You seem to know her. - Yeah. - So is she always like that? - Ever since I met her, man. But I must admit, you outlasted her other dates. - Really? By the way, I'm Wesley. - Ali. Really, some people say Miss Moore and her sister are mean, but deep down inside when you get to know 'em, they're really sweet. Besides, she must like you. - What makes you say that? - You were late, and she still stayed to meet with you. That's big. - One second. Hey mom. - Wes. You busy? - No, not really. I had a date earlier, but she just left. - Oh a date, how'd it go? - I mean, it was a little different, but it was okay. - What did he say? He said it was just okay? - Is that Uncle Marlone in the background? - You got it, baby, the one and only! - You're home for Christmas already? - Yes. I flew in early, 'cause I wanted to spend some time with my sister. And we're supposed to be decorating this beautiful tree. But your mother hates untangling Christmas lights, so she throws that all on me. - What? Marlone, give me my phone back. Wes, I called you for two reasons. When are you coming home? - I'm not sure. - Well, you know I miss you-- - Oh, here we go. - And I can't wait for you to come home, and I want you to stay longer this year. - I'll try my best to get there, mom. - You know this is my favorite time of year. - I know. - You can't let what happened last year stop you from coming home this year. - Mom, let me do something nice for you, okay? - What's that? - How about I fly you here, we have lunch, go Christmas shopping, wouldn't you like that? - I would. But I also want you to come home. - Okay mom, I'll come home. - Okay, well. Oh, look at that, it's amazing! I got so much planned for everybody. - So what's the second thing you wanted to tell me? - Oh. Alicia asked about you. - Alicia? Asked about me? - Well, I saw her in the store, and she wanted to know how you were doing. - Mom, she doesn't need to ask about me, I've moved on. Let me give you a call after my meeting tonight, okay? We'll talk more. - Okay. Oh, call me back. - Will do. - Bye. - Now why did you tell him you saw Alicia? You know what that girl did to him last year. - Yeah, I remember. - Yeah, well, now he might not come home, Charlotte. - What, he said he was gonna come home. And I don't want him to come home for one day, I want him to stay longer this year. - Okay, well I'm sure he'll stay longer this year, but you can't put so much pressure on him. I mean, all these questions, are you coming home? When are you coming home? - I'm not putting any pressure on him, I just want my family to be together. - And your family will be together. - Is that too much to ask? I've been planning this Christmas week for a long time. I want it to be perfect. - Okay sis, it's gonna be perfect, everybody knows you don't play when it comes to your holidays. - Right. - All right? I mean, he said he was flying you out to see him before Christmas, so maybe he'll fly back with you. Relax. All right? Now in the mean time, I need some help untangling these lights. - No, that's your job. - You something else. (laughing) - Come on. - Look at this tree, girl, you outdid yourself. (car horn hooting) (playful music) - Before we wrap up, I need you all to think of ways to market our players and organization. Guys, social media is the way to reach our fans. We gotta be engaging, and create fan participation. It's important to maintain an active presence on social media. Let's figure it out. And I'll meet again with you all later today, all right? Good job. (clapping) (elevator beeping) - Oh, Mr. Saxon, sir? - Yes, sir? - I wanted to ask you a question, but not in front of everyone. - What's your question? - Can I go home early for Christmas? - [Wesley] Early? Why? - Our mom called and she needs help with the decorations, says you won't be home 'til Christmas. - You talked to mom today? - Yeah, she was very disappointed that you're not staying long. And you know this is her favorite time of the year, everyone's coming. - Yeah, I know. I'm thinking about it, but I just don't wanna go and see-- - Alicia, right? - Alicia and I are over. I've moved on. - Have you really moved on? - Yes. - Hey, I just had to ask, man. - I told mom I'll fly her out to have lunch with me. - That's nice, but you know she really wants you home. - But, how was the date the other night? - [Blythe] It's your favorite cousin! And yes, I know what time it is. - You're my only cousin, Blythe, what are you doing here? And you know that key is for emergencies only. - Well, I called to tell you I was stopping by, but since you won't answer, and you haven't called me in three hours, I thought you might have some company. And what is going on with the Christmas decorations? - Oh girl please, you know I don't do that. No Blythe, I don't have any company. Besides, I'm way too busy to have anyone over right now. - So? - So, it's pretty late, and you should probably-- - Oh! No, no, no. How did your afternoon with Wesley go? That's all I wanna know? - Well, if you must know, he was late. - Really? - [Elle] Yes. - What happened? - He said his meeting ran longer than he expected. - Well, his meetings do run over sometimes, but other than him being a little late, what did you think about him? - Well, he seemed to be okay. - Just okay? Wesley Saxon is Maryland's most eligible bachelor. Women at work run to him. - Oh really? - Yes really. He has the best personality ever, a great smile. Girl, that man is wealthy, okay? And he's such a sweetheart! I cannot believe you're not interested. - Blythe! I have my own wealth. And men, they, I have men running to me. - They run away from you. - All right, how'd she look? - She's beautiful. - Let me ask you this question. Is she mean? - No, no, no. She's just a little stressed. - Just a little stressed? - Yeah, I guess her job. She actually had to leave the date early to go back to work. Her phone kept ringing nonstop. - Red flag. - What do you mean? - Look, I would leave her alone. - I'm just saying. How many talks have we had about you and your dates? - I don't remember. - You don't wanna remember, but we've had many conversations about you. - Well, you need to have a conversation with Mr. Saxon about punctuality, okay? He was late, so I had to end our date early. - You left early? - Yeah. - [Blythe] Why? - Because I had to get back to work. - You did not do that. - Yes I did, I had to work. - Do me a favor. Take a break from work. - Why? - Because you work too much, and I just want you to enjoy this Christmas. And hopefully, just hopefully, stop being so mean. - I am not mean! - Me and Jeremy, we went on a double date with two beautiful women. But Jeremy's date, she was rude and mean. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, and her phone kept ringing too. I could not wait for that double date to be over. - I bet. - I told Jeremy, "Look, you need to get out." He took my advice and got out. So take mine too, baby bro. - Yeah, okay. - And you said that she left the date early, right? - Yeah, so? - Another red flag, bro. Obviously her job is gonna come first, and you won't be first priority. - Do you know what your staff calls you at work? - Miss Moore? - No. Behind your back, your nickname is Elle-benezer. - Oh? Huh. Well, it's not the worst I've heard. - Listen, I'm just telling you what I heard. You need to relax and balance yourself. - Well, I don't think I work too much. And I am balanced, I don't know what y'all talking about. - What are you doing right now? Working! - And you said that she was stressed too, right? - So what? - So if you're stressed, she's only gonna add more stress to your life. - I don't know why I even listen to you. - You don't know why you listen to me? - No. - What happened with Alicia? What did I tell you about her? I'll wait. Exactly. You know I was right about her. - Not really. - Okay. Well, who was there for you when your little heart got broken? - Mom. - You have not been the same since your parents left and your sister moved away. - Ooh. Okay, well, I'm sleepy, it's time for you to go. Come on. - Girl, you are not sleepy. - Yes I am. Let's do lunch tomorrow. - Oh! We will do lunch, and it is on me. - Okay, that's fine, come on, let's go. And make sure you leave my key! - Oh girl, you can have that one. - Another red flag, Wes. But hey, you do what you wanna do. I'm just trying to help. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Well, I appreciate you looking out for me, big brother, but I'm good. - Hey, it's my job to help. I mean, you really should thank me. - Okay. So when are you going home? - In a few days. I'll go help set up with decorations. Oh, and mom says adding a game night this year. - What? - Yeah. - That would be fun. - Yeah, you know it's not a Saxon Christmas without those playing cards. (car horn hooting) (steps tapping) (Elle gasping) - Did you not see me coming? - [Stephen] I'm sorry-- - Hello, answer me! Did you not see me coming? - I'm sorry Miss Moore! - What is your name? - My name? - Yes, your name, what is your name? - Stephen. - Stephen. Don't let this happen again, or you will be unemployed. - Yes. - Pay attention next time! - [Stephen] Okay. - Move! (gentle music) (phone ringing) (door knocking) - Miss Moore, I have your blouse. - [Elle] Just leave it there, I'll get it. - Your receipt is in the bag. - [Elle] Thank you. - [Blythe] It's me! - [Elle] Blythe, what are you doing here? - Ooh! Whose flowers? - I'm ready to go to lunch. - Blythe, whose flowers? - Yours. - Mine? Well who sent these? Did Wesley send these? - Maybe, maybe not. - Blythe! Did he? (Blythe laughing) Girl, did he send the flowers? - Yes. Wesley asked me to bring you these when we talked today at the office. - You talked to him today at work? - You know I had to ask him, how did he enjoy his date with you. - And then he sent my favorite flowers? Okay. So what did he say? - You know Wesley. He's the type who's only gonna say just a little. - Okay, so what did he say? - He wants to see you again. Then he had to leave to get to a meeting so we couldn't finish our conversation, but you guys are gonna be perfect together. I can see it now, the kids, the wedding! - Okay now, don't get ahead of yourself. You did say that he gets a lot of attention from admirers. - Oh! - But anyways, enough of that! I am glad you're here, 'cause I wanted to ask you, what are we doing for Christmas this year? Last year Eva and I spent the entire week with you and Garrett. That was so much fun! - About that. - Okay. - I don't know how to tell you this. - [Elle] Just tell me. - This year Garrett wants to take me to the mountains. - The mountains? But you don't even ski, Blythe. - I can learn, Eleanor! Besides, Garrett is gonna be right there to catch me when I fall, which I'm looking forward to, okay? - [Elle] Well, have fun at your little mountains. - Don't act like that. Don't get upset because I said I'm going to the mountains. - Don't get upset? How am I supposed to not get upset, Blythe? You're literally the only family that I have. Eva's not here. My parents aren't here anymore. I don't have a husband. You're all I got, Blythe. I just. I feel really alone sometimes, especially around the holiday season. - I know. And I know it's heard since you and Eva lost your parents in the car accident. - It is. But I just miss them so much. - It'll be okay. - Yeah. I know. I just wish that I could meet someone who understands me. I wanna have a good Christmas too. - And you will! You just have to learn how to enjoy life, even while you're single. It's gonna be okay. Elle, sweetie? - Yes? - Are you hungry? (giggling) - You know I'm always hungry. - Let's go get you something to eat. - Okay. - [Blythe] Okay? (laughing) - [Charlotte] Hey son! My flight lands at 11:00 a.m. - [Wesley] Okay. I'll have my assistant pick you up. - [Charlotte] Perfect. You know you're coming back home with me, right? (Wesley laughing) - [Wesley] I hear you, mom. I'll see you in a few. - [Charlotte] Oh, I can't wait to see you! Bye. - Welcome to River Town Bistro, ladies, what can we get you started off with here to drink? Your usual, Miss Moore? (speaking foreign language) - You know it. - [Ali] All right. - I'll have the same. - [Ali] Okay, I'll be right back shortly. - Thank you. Not today. - [Elle] What? - Put your phone down. - There. Sent. My phone is on the table, face down. - And when it makes an alert, you will not pick it up again. You have to learn to be away from your phone so you can enjoy life. - It's my job! It's my job. - If Uncle Marvin knew that this job was having an effect on his girls like this, he will be so disappointed. - [Ali] Ma'am, here's your drink. - [Blythe] Thank you. - [Ali] And for you, Miss Moore. - [Elle] Thank you. - [Ali] And are you ready to order? - Are you ready to order? - Yes, I will have your lunch special. - [Ali] Okay, all right. - I'll have the same. - [Ali] Okay, will be right back. - Thank you. So I was thinking that we can go to like-- (table tapping) Hey. What is up with you? - He's here. - Wesley? - Yes. Did you know he was coming? - No, I did not know. Is he meeting someone? He's just sitting over there alone. - Well, go over there and sit with him then. - I am not! - Why not? - Because then you will be alone. - I will be perfectly fine sitting here alone. I'm in a relationship. - I am not going over here. - That man could be your Christmas gift. Go. - No! - Eleanor Moore. We just talked about you being a little more open and getting to know someone. Just go say hello and thank him for the flowers. Okay? - Okay. You're right, I'll go. - Good, and sit with him too, I'll be right back. - Wait, Blythe. How do I look, I got anything in my teeth? - Oh, so now you wanna ask me-- - Girl, how do I look? - You look good, go over there and talk to him. - All right. (Elle sighing) - Mom, I'm so glad you can have lunch with me. - Oh, I'm glad you had time to spend with your mother, son. - Absolutely, it's the least I can do. Besides, I can tell how much you miss seeing me. - I do. - So I wanted to do something nice for you. - Okay mom, what is it? You know I can tell when something's on your mind. - Well, your uncle told me not to stay anything. But I gotta know, are you gonna stay longer this year? - Uncle Marlone and I talked about a few things. And I'm thinking about, but-- - But nothing, it's Christmas. This is our time to be together as a family. So what is there to think about? - I think you should try the crab cakes. They're amazing here, just like you, mom. (Charlotte laughing) - Boy, you are your father's son. Such a charmer. - Oh my goodness. Mom, do you remember that date I was telling you about? - The one that left early. - [Wesley] That's the one. - Yeah. - I'd like to see her again. - Oh! You don't have her number? - Not exactly. She left before I could get it. She had to work early. - Oh. Thank you. Well, I can tell you like her. - How? - Just the way you smile, I mean, I could only imagine if she was standing right here, you will just be cheesing it in. - I would still be cool. Just like Pops taught me. - Okay Mr. Cool. (laughing) What you eating? - The crab cakes, mom. - [Ali] Enjoy, ladies. - Thank you. This looks amazing. Doesn't this look amazing? Hello. - I'm sorry. What'd you say? - It doesn't matter, did you speak to Wesley? - No, I didn't go. - Why not? - 'Cause. Some lady over here has his attention. - Oh girl, I have no clue who she is. - You don't? - [Blythe] No. - I should walk over there and say, "Oh really, another date?" Like weren't just on one a few days ago. - No. I think we should about it before we go marching over there, because we don't know who this woman could be. - No. - [Blythe] Elle. - [Elle] That's it. - Elle. - [Elle] I'm going. - It's Christmas, and I wanna keep my job. (Blythe sighing) - Excuse me, Wesley. - Elle? What a surprise? Meet my mom, Charlotte Saxon. - Your mom? Your mom, isn't this lovely? How are you doing, Mrs. Saxon? - Oh, I'm doing well, Elle. (Charlotte laughing) It's great to meet you. - You too. Wesley, I just wanted to come over and thank you for the flowers. That was very thoughtful of you. - It was my pleasure. I wanted to make up for being late to our date. So how are you? Would you like to join us? - Oh, no, no, no, I don't wanna impose. - Mom, you don't mind. - No! - No, it's fine. I don't wanna impose, I see you're enjoying your meal with your mom. I just saw you, wanted to come speak. Well, Miss Saxon, it was very nice to meet you. - Oh, same here. Hopefully I get to see you again, yeah? - Hopefully. Enjoy your lunch. - You too. - Thanks. - Elle. I know you're really busy, but if you could squeeze me into your schedule I would love for us to go on another date. Soon. - I don't know. I'm really busy right now with the fourth quarter. I have so many meetings and papers. - No, I get it, I get it. You're really busy. - You know what? Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Do you mind if I get your number? - My number? - To get you details. - Right. - You left early last time. My mom thinks you're beautiful, by the way. - [Elle] Really? - Well, I better get back to my mom. - Back to, good. - I'll go this. - Okay. Okay. - Did I just see Wesley Saxon give you his phone to put your number in it? - Yes, and he asked me to go out with him too. - He did? - [Elle] Yes. - Who is the woman? - His mother. - See girl, you're always jumping to conclusions. If you just listened to me. I'm trying to get you a husband, okay? - Okay. (giggling) (car horn hooting) (gentle festive music) - There you are. I figured I'd find you here. - What's up? - Nothing, just packing for Carolina. - Oh yeah, you're leaving. When? - After the game. - Cool. - So, how was dinner with mom the other day? - That's not what you wanna know. - And you are absolutely right. No, Faith told me that mom met Ellie, Eshay-- - It's Elle. - What'd she say? - She thanked me for the flowers. - Oh okay, she has manners. - She does. - Why haven't I met her, Wes? - You've been busy, in and out of town. But you'll meet her soon. - Soon? - Oh yeah. Thinking about inviting her home for Christmas. - Christmas where? - In South Carolina? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down bro, you're moving too fast. - I don't want her to be alone for the holidays, Ryan. - She's just gonna ruin Christmas for us. - No she won't. - I'm only saying. Anyway. I need to know, are you ready for the biggest rivalry game of the year? Oh, come on. - I won't be able to go. - Oh, come on! You're gonna miss the game, all of a sudden you can't go? Why? - I invited Elle to go on another date with me. - Are you serious? - I am. - You're gonna miss the biggest game of the year to go on a date with her? - Yes. And if you could get a date, you would too. - Well, why didn't you invite me? - [Wesley] Because it's a date! - Oh, you're right. I'll be home anyway. - Great. - So? Are you gonna go pick up Elle? - If she wants me to pick her up, or if she wants me to meet her there. It's whatever she wants me to do. - Complicated already, why can't she just ride in the car with you? - You're not giving this girl a chance at all. - I've dated girls her type. Listen to me. (gentle festive music) - [Blythe] Elle! - I'm in my room! - What is going on in here? - I can't find anything to wear. - Did you put this much effort into all your other dates? - You just think you're so funny, huh? (Blythe laughing) - I'm only asking. You have so much to wear, why are you stressed out? - What time is it? - 6:45. - It's already 6:45? Look at me! - Okay, calm down. I'm gonna help you. - Okay. - I'll get your outfit, you go do your hair. - Okay. (gentle festive music) (Elle sighing) Eleanor Moore, relax. Smile. Turn your phone off and just enjoy yourself for once. Wesley. - Wow. (Elle laughing) You look gorgeous. - Thank you. - You ready to go in? - Yeah. - Let's go. (gentle festive music) - I had a really great time with you. - So did I. - I didn't know you were friends with the saxophonist. - Really good friends, actually. - Oh, okay. - Listen, I wanna ask you something. - Sure, what is it? - I'm going home soon, and I'd like to know if you'd like to come and spend Christmas in Carolina with me. Only if you're comfortable with the idea of spending Christmas in Carolina with my family. You heard about my family, we've got this really big Christmas fest. And every year, my mom hosts a game night. We have this church event. We just really got a lot going on. - Yes. I would love to spend Christmas in Carolina with you. (phone ringing) - I'm sorry, give me. Not a good time, Ryan. Listen, I'll call you later, okay? Sorry about that. Thought my phone was on vibrate. Clearly I was wrong. - [Elle] Clearly. - So where were we? - You were walking me to my car. - Okay. (gentle festive music) - [Faith] Hey mom. - Hey. Oh, thanks Faith. - Yeah, no problem. - [Ryan] Hey, ma. - Hey. - What did Wesley say? - He said he and his girlfriend will be here tomorrow. - Girlfriend? - Your brother and his girlfriend will be here tomorrow. - Look mom, I don't think this girl is right for Wes. Look, he's just gonna fall in love easily, and get his heart broken. I'm just trying to help him. - Ryan. Stay out of that. - Stay out of it? I can't, he's my brother, and it's my job to protect him. - Oh honey, you've always been a great protector but sometimes you do too much. - What do I do, mom? Uncle Marlone, I can talk to you. - Yeah, nephew. - Now, you know I've always been very protective when it comes to my siblings. - Yeah, like me. - Exactly. And I just told your sister, my beautiful mom, that I don't think this girl is right for Wes, and do you know what she told me? - Stay out of that, Ryan. - Exactly. - Yeah. - Exactly. Whenever your brother starts dating somebody, you always have a problem. He seems happy, so stay out of it. And when she comes, be nice! - Oh mom. - Did you finish hanging those lights, nephew? - Are you two serious? You're really worried about the lights? - Yeah. (banging) Hey, knock that off back there! (Charlotte sighing) Oh it was you! Come here, what you want? (Charlotte laughing) - [Girl] Apple! - Your apple? There you are. - [Girl] This is a little piece. - You want a whole apple? Here you go. - [Girl] Thank you. - You're welcome. (Charlotte laughing) - I think Wes might be serious. - What do you mean? - He called me a couple of days ago talking about how he feels about that girl, Elle. - Oh, what he say? - I wouldn't be surprised if he asked her to marry him. - You think he's gonna propose? - Wouldn't be surprised at all. - What? Listen, all I want is for Christmas to go on without a hitch. No mishaps. - Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. Ain't gonna be no hitches and mishaps, all right? Relax, sis! We got this. And where is Dr. John? - He called and said he's on his way. - Cool. It's 'gon be a good day, Dr. John is on his way. - That's right. There's some lights to be hung. - All right, I'll go and get the lights. - Thank you. - [Marlone] All right, sis. Dr. John is on his way! Ding-ah-ling, merry man! (car horn hooting) (train beeping) (car horns hooting) - I can't believe it's almost time to meet your family. - Are you ready? - I am. I can't wait to meet them. - They can't wait to meet you. I've been telling them just how wonderful you are. - Oh! You think I'm wonderful? - Of course. Call me when you leave work. - Okay. (playful music) (boxes banging) - Oh miss. - Stephen, right? - Yes, ma'am, yes. - You did this again? - I'm sorry Miss Moore, please, it was an accident. Please don't send to the unemployment line. - It's okay, it's okay. You're not going there, accidents happen. Just try not to have your boxes stacked so high you can't see around them. - Yes, that's a good idea. - There you go. Merry Christmas, Stephen. (Elle laughing) (elevator bell dinging) (cheerful festive music) (notification beeping) (notification beeping) (notification beeping) (notification beeping) (notification beeping) (phone ringing) - Mom, what's up? - [Blythe] Elle! Why are you still working? - I'm just finishing up a few things here. I thought you left already. - Not yet. I wanted to see you before we did leave. Are you gonna be okay? - I will be fine. - When are you and Wesley leaving? - Wesley is gonna pick me up this afternoon. - I'm so excited for you. - Girl, thank you for introducing us. You got this one date right this time. - You're welcome. (laughing) I'm just glad it's working out between you two. - Me too. I don't know, it just feels. It just feels like-- - Right with him? - Yeah. Like we've known each other for a long time. - Are you in love? Do you love him? - It's too soon to say-- - Elle. Stop. Do you love him? - I could. I don't know. - [Blythe] Does he know that? - No, no. I am not telling him that. - And why not? - Because he can tell me first. - Elle. If you really feel this way about Wesley, you need to express to him how you feel. - But what if he doesn't feel the same? - What if he does? Listen, when you get there, you need to charm the pants off his mom, okay? If you win the mom, you win the man. Everything she says is funny, and I mean everything, okay? You need to do the laugh. - The laugh? - Take notes. - What is that. (laughing loudly) - Come on. (laughing loudly) Oh, Miss Saxon! (laughing loudly) - Oh, Miss Saxon! (laughing loudly) You're so silly. (laughing) I love you. - I love you too. - Okay well, I guess it's settled. I'm gonna tell him when I get to Carolina. - Yes. Tell him how you truly feel. - I will. (laughing) (gentle festive music) - Welcome to my home. (Elle sighing) I'm sure my family is anxious to meet you. - Do you think they'll like me? - Absolutely, they'll love you. Relax, sweetie. - I'm trying to, I'm just a little nervous. - My family will love you. - Okay. (gentle festive music) - Is everything okay? Everything is gonna be great. I got you. - Okay. - Ready to go in? - Yeah. - Let's go. Hey! - Wes, hey! - Meet Elle. - Elle, nice to meet you! Faith. - Nice to meet you too! - You as well, yeah! - Where's mom and dad? - Okay, so mom's in the kitchen, but dad couldn't make it, so. - All right, well, let me go see everybody. - All right, all right, I'll see you. - Okay. - Thank you. - You got it. (chips clicking) - Merry Christmas! (Charlotte yelling) - Oh, merry Christmas! Oh my goodness! - Uncle Marlone! - Nephew! Good to see you, baby boy! - Oh I thought you were gonna bring-- - Everybody meet my girlfriend, Elle. - [Charlotte] Hi. - Hi! - Oh my goodness, it's so good to see you again. - It's good to see you too, Miss Saxon! You have a lovely home. - Oh! - Decorated very nicely. - Thank you, it's our favorite time of year. And please, call me Charlotte. - So I've been told! (Elle laughing loudly) Oh Charlotte! (Elle laughing loudly) (Wesley clearing throat) - Mom, is the food ready? - Yes, but we're not ready to eat. - Uncle Marlone! Are those your famous cinnamon rolls I smell in the oven? - Yeah, just put 'em in a little while ago. - My uncle makes the best cinnamon rolls, everybody loves them. - Facts, what a honey. (laughing) I got one with your name on it if you'd like that. - I would love that. - Look, so, where's your luggage? - In the car. I was actually about to go get them. - Okay, well, while you go get the luggage, I'll show you where you'll be staying. - Okay. - [Marlone] All right. (Marlone laughing) - [Ryan] Wesley! - What's up, bro? - What up, baby bro? Just getting here? - Yeah, about 10 minutes ago. - Where's Eshay, Ella-- - It's Elle. - Oh, okay. I don't see her, did she change her mind? - Hey, she's with your mother, all right? And how did you meet her? - A mutual friend set us up, huh? And after our first date in it, I wanted to see her again. - So he brings her here to ruin our Christmas. - No she won't. - That's what you think. - Hey, hey, hey, all right you two. Now listen, you know how special this holiday is to your mother, okay? Now I promised her everything was gonna go smoothly, and I don't any issues out of you two, or it's gonna be problems and repercussions! You understand that, Wes? - Yes, sir. - Ryan? - Yes, sir. - All right, now let's go give that girl her luggage, come on. Nephew, you did good, huh? - You think so, uncle? - Yeah, she got all her teeth. - [Wesley] Yeah, she does. - [Marlone] All right! (cheerful festive music) - Oh, wow. This room is beautiful, Miss Saxon. I meant Charlotte. - Thank you, I tried it really comfortable for you, sweetie. - Oh. I haven't seen one of these in a long time. - Really? It's one of my favorite snow globes. - It's beautiful. - Oh, thank you. Well, I'll see you downstairs for the family game night. - Okay, sounds exciting! (cheerful festive music) - Now sweetie, make yourself at home. We have more than enough. - Thank you so much! I will. (gentle festive music) - You okay? - I am. Your family is so nice. And there's so many of you. - Oh yeah, there's a lot of us all right. And more. These are the ones who could make it here for Christmas. - I love it. - Care to play a game? - [Elle] Sure. (people chattering) - [Ryan] Hello. - Hello. - [Ryan] Y'all play some cards? - Sure. - I'm Ryan. - Nice to meet you, Ryan. - You look so familiar. Have we met before? - No? - I feel like we've met before. - I don't remember meeting you. - Are you sure? - She said no Ryan! - But Wesley has told me a lot of great things about you. - Oh, he has? - [Elle] Yeah. - That's good to know. - Oh gosh. I haven't played this game since I was young. - [Ryan] Yo, you got a minute? - Yeah, what's up? - Nothing. I just wanted to say that Elle, right? - That's right. - Elle seems pretty cool, but she looks so familiar, like I met her before. - What do you mean? - Can't quite put my finger on it, but she knows me, Wes. - She never mentioned you. - Ask her does she know me. - I'm not gonna ask her that, because she does not know you. Listen, don't start. Besides, the only question I'm gonna ask her is, "Will you marry me?" - Marry you? Why? - I love her. - Look, she's not right for you, bro. - You're right. She's perfect for me. As a matter of fact, I'm picking up her engagement ring soon. - Look, you're making a terrible mistake! - My mind is already made up, Ryan. - You sure you wanna do this? (Charlotte clearing throat) - I am. - All right. (gentle festive music) - Hello. - Hi! - Oh, these past few days have been amazing! I'm having so much fun. - Are you? - Yes, I am! I can't believe Christmas Eve is tomorrow. Well, can I help you do anything? - Oh sure, I won't turn down help. - Okay. - Here you go. I sure love seeing you and Wesley smile. (Elle sighing) - He's such a wonderful, man, Charlotte. He's just so understanding, kindhearted and funny. I love him. - Me too. (laughing) - I don't know, I just haven't really had the courage to tell him yet. - Elle, just tell him. I'm sure he'll say the same thing to you. - You think so? - I know so. - Okay. Well, I will. - You two remind me of me and John. - We do? - Yeah. - [Elle] Oh. - You can't play with it, baby, you gotta-- - Okay now, okay. - Get in there. (Elle laughing) Like that, good. (gentle festive music) - So I picked up Elle's engagement ring today. - You're seriously gonna ask her? - Yeah, I am. - But what if she does the same thing that Alicia did to you? - She's not Alicia. And besides, I can't let that stop me from asking. I wanna marry her. - And when do you plan to do this? - I was thinking about tomorrow night. Plan to take her for a stroll on the riverwalk. - As cold as it is, you wanna propose on a riverwalk? - Whenever I'm around Elle I can only feel her warmth. - Look bro, for the last time, wake up. She's not being truthful-- - Chill! Chill, Ryan! All right? - Okay Wes, I tried to warn you, but she's just gonna break your heart like Alicia. - No she won't. (gentle festive music) (Elle humming) - Oh, hey Ryan. Where's Wesley? Okay, maybe he didn't hear me. Hey Ryan, have you seen Wesley? - Where's my cinnamon roll? There's only one left. - Oh, I have it. But here, you can have it. - Are you seriously gonna pretend to not know me? - Excuse me? - You went on a date with me. How could you do this to my brother? - Do what to your brother? - By not telling him the truth. - Ryan, I haven't lied to your brother. I don't know what you're talking about. - Are you gonna tell him, or do I need to tell him? - Tell him what? - Yeah. Tell me what? - Look Wes, I know this is hard for you to hear, but your girlfriend is a liar. - Excuse me? - [Wesley] What? - I'm only trying to help you, Wes. - You're not helping. Why do you always get so jealous. - Jealous of you? I'm telling you the truth! - About what? - Yeah? What? - Remember the double date I told you about? That's her. She was with Jeremy. - [Elle] Who is Jeremy? - She's not even being honest with you. I told you to leave her alone. - Wesley, I haven't lied to you. I don't know what your brother is talking about. - And you're gonna believe her over me. - Yeah, I am. She hasn't lied to me. - [Ryan] Look, I know you're upset, Wes. - Upset? Upset doesn't even begin to describe it. Since I first told you about Elle, you've been nagging about her the entire time. - And I'm only trying to help you. - You're not helping! Just like you didn't help with Alicia. You're doing the same thing to Elle that you did with Alicia. - And it wasn't my fault! I told you she wasn't right for you! - There it is! And you know much I loved Alicia. But I'm in love with Elle. (counter banging) Good job. - Ryan. Come here. - Uncle Marlone, Wesley-- - Sit down. That's their relationship, their business. You don't need to interfere. What are you doing, man? Look, your brother loves her. And if you love him, you'll accept that. - Elle, Elle. Are you okay? - Not right now, Charlotte. - Elle. Why are you packing? At least stay for the Christmas program tomorrow. - The one time everything is going perfect in my life, this has to happen. - Elle, listen. Everything is still going great in your life. (door knocking) - [Wesley] You wanna talk? - Not right now. - Listen. Wait a minute, listen, just one second. (gentle festive music) ♪ Away in a manger, no crib for a bed ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head ♪ ♪ The stars in the sky looked down where He lay ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay ♪ - I think all of us are familiar with social media and the various platforms on social media, and the fact that when an individual sets up on social media, he or she sets up a profile. Personal, professional profile. And a part of the personal profile that typically is used is a question like, what is your relationship status? And they're the typical ones, single, married, and then there's that one, it's complicated. (congregation laughing) I'm not going to ask how many of you have as your relationship status, "It's complicated." The story of Christmas is about a couple. If Mary and Joseph had had Facebook 2,000 years ago, they definitely could have placed as their relationship status, "It's complicated." What had begun as a normal situation-- - Are you okay? - [Bishop Blue] For those times, it was a situation-- - We should talk. - [Bishop Blue] Called betrothal. Betrothal-- - Okay. - Is very similar to what we now call engagement. And they were going along steadily until a totally unexpected issue arose that threatened the very fabric of their flow. We bless tonight, because what began as a complicated relationship, instead of breaking down, broke through. And that's the whole point of Christmas. (congregation clapping) When Jesus came, it was a complicated moment in history to a complicated world. But love broke through. It always does. It always will. And so was it complicated? Yes! But is it impossible? No. Because with God nothing shall be impossible. May God bless you.
