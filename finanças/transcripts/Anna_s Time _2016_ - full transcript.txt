Anna's time Jean, hurry up, it's daybreak. I've finished. Stop! - You're late! - We came across a Swiss patrol. Have you got the goods? It's good quality stuff. Ok, fellows. We can load up. - Clever, fixing your watch like that. - Yep. Yep, it's handy. In battle, time you get your watch out you're dead. I'll be glad when this fucking war's over. Ssh! Ssh! Let's hide, quick! Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! It's you that are afraid! Is that coal? Yep, to keep warm in the factory. You can't work in this cold weather. Attach my horse to the cart. Hurry up, I've just passed a patrol. Thanks miss... My name's Anna... Anna Von ruhr. I'm Jean schaeffer. And here are my friends, Abraham blum, and the moaning machine there, gaspard sandoz. - I must say you're a cheeky one... - For a classy lady? Excuse him and his socialist ideas. Gaspard gets at everyone. He's right. You were risking your lives. He who would rather die or win is rarely beaten. - You know corneille? - That's the only line I can remember. Goodbye, Jean schaeffer. Try to stay alive. May I hope to see you again? No, I'm afraid not. I'm engaged. Forget it, Jean... She's not from your world. There's only one world, gaspard. You haven't been followed? No, everything went well! It's unbelievable! French soldiers wear their watches on their wrists. On their wrists? Why? As wristwatches? What a great idea! That's idiotic! - What's that? - It's our share. - I said one bag for the three of you. - We need to keep warm too! Abraham's a wife and child dying of hunger at home. - The factory has priority. - No, we've taken the risks. My watches are my payment. Sandoz, take two bags into the cellar. Next time I'll fire you! Ladies, may I introduce our best worker, Jean schaeffer. Jean, miss Elisabeth grimm and her friend, miss Anna Von rohr. Pleased to meet you, ladies. But mr girard exaggerates. We owe him the invention of the wristwatch! - A little to me, of course, all the same... - Bravo! - You had to have the idea. - I wasn't the first... Listen to me! What's going on there? Capitalism is at its end! Break's been over for ten minutes, er... I'll go and see. Say no to exploitation... The proletariat, the only legitimate force must take over the power. To free ourselves from our banks' evil activities! We must unite to put an end to our employers' dictatorship! Shut your trap, sandoz! Get out! | warned you. You're fired! Workers have a right to a trade union. Yes, and I have a right to fire you! Scram! Go and join the bolsheviks! Ladies, I am sorry... If he goes, I go too. - What? - I'm resigning. - You're mad. No! - Leave me alone. How can you do that to me? You owe me everything. I'll tell you what, Jean schaeffer. You are and will remain a mere small workman. We'll see. Goodbye. Jean! Gaspard! Wait for me! What are you all goofing at? Get back to work! Goddamn it! At once! | must say, you're real comrades, mates! We're friends, gaspard, friends. Ok, if you like. Anyway, we're together. - We'll stay together. - That's right. Jean! Jean! Wait! Stop! Stop! - What will you do now? - What I've always wanted to do. Create a brand of watch with gaspard and Abraham. - Can I help you? - You already have. Without you, I'd never have had the courage to leave girard. He who would rather die or win is rarely beaten. You haven't forgotten it? Do you know the pury country inn? Yes. I'll be there on Sunday morning to start on my ride. You secretive thing! Since when have you gone round with workmen? Ssh! Start off! This will get you into trouble, jeannot. It sure will. - Good morning, miss. - Good morning, Jean. - I wasn't sure you'd be here. - You can call me Anna. - I've got a horse for you. - I haven't ridden for 20 years. Doctors advised me not to ride. Smuggling was much more dangerous, wasn't it? Today you're the dangerous one. | was ten years old. My horse bolted and I was thrown off here. It wasn't the fall that hurt most... My grandfather had made me a wonderful watch... It fell out of my pocket and! Found it later in a puddle. It never went again. I swore I'd invent an impermeable watch. A waterproof watch. Do you think it's a crazy idea? | find a lot crazy, but not that. Excuse me, aren't you married? No. - But back then you said... - I said no. You're beautiful, Anna. I've nothing to give you. Mrs Von ruhr. Sit down, my good man. Let's get to the point. Well, I'll be honest with you. | come from a simple background, and I'm a watchmaker. | know your daughter certainly aspires to a much... | fear nobody knows my daughter's aspirations, mr schaeffer. Come to the point! Well, madam... I have a few savings. My parents have left me a small legacy. I'll soon have my own workshop, I'll be self-employed. I'm already known to be a good watchmaker. | promise I'll do everything possible to ensure an easy life for your daughter. What a speech for a young man. Do you want to marry Anna? Yes, I love your daughter. You have my permission, mr schaeffer. - Bravo! - Long live the newlyweds! - Long live the newlyweds! - Bravo! - Long life to the newlyweds! - Bravo! - Long life to the newlyweds! - Best wishes! - Here's the champagne! - Look, luxury is nice, isn't it? - Gentlemen! - Only if everyone can have it. By the way... Does Anna know you haven't a bean? Of course she does. Excuse me, but I find it strange that a "Von rohr" agrees... To give her daughter to a worker out of work. Why spoil everything? What if this woman prefers love to money? | can't believe the rich would. | only want us to rejoice in Jean's happiness. Anna gives me strength and makes me feel so happy. I'm sorry. I'm a fool. To your wedding! - To your happiness! - To us, my friends! What's all that? My mother's given us all this furniture. But the flat is far too small! We'll soon have a big house, | promise you! Then you can put in all the furniture you want. | couldn't care less, as long as I'm with you. Open it. My ribbon. You've kept it! It's the first wristwatch I made just after we met. My angel. A month later. We need more furniture and especially tools for the assemblage. We'll get them. As soon as we're in credit. We've already waited a week. And your watches? What name will you give them? The one my grandfather wanted to give them at his time, mido. Hello, Elisabeth! Elisabeth! Look what I've unearthed! A wireless set! My gift for your installation. You're amazing! That's what people say. But it's not only for you, my little Jean. - Well, so now it's official. - Well, you can say so. Does she know you're penniless? He has much better qualities in love, Jean! - To us, friends! To mido. - To the workers' victory! To love! Anna? Anna, are you there? Where's the dresser? And the picture? And all your furniture? - I've sold it all. - What? So you can buy equipment and start working without waiting for the bank. You mustn't sacrifice your possessions. 1, your husband, must keep you. And I'm your wife. If I can help with our household, I'll do so. But it shouldn't be like that. Would you rather wait and not work? Do you prefer to be in debt for years? Or is it because I'm a woman and classy. - Neither the one nor the other. - Marriage is a partnership, isn't it? Yes, but a partnership with different tasks. And if I did it simply out of love? You're too proud, Jean. Sometimes I wonder if I am worthy of you. Silly Billy, I'm like any other woman. You're not. Thank you, darling. It will also enable us to get our child's room ready. Our child? The British prime minister Lloyd George has reacted to president poincarés suggestion... Concerning Germany's compensation, reminding that France had been the most severely hit. Seeing that the pound sterling is quoted at 4000 marks in Berlin... Jean! Is worth noting. And now, it's time for some music! Is it true she's moving to Paris? Excellent work, young man. Thank you, mr Dubois. But to be honest, | can't see how I can help you. Put them in one of your salesrooms. You needn't pay me till you've sold them. | leave it to you to fix the sale price and your profit margin. - What's it made of? - It's enamel. As you can see the side's been guilloched. Its asset is its lightness. This watch, for example was 50 hours' work... Anna! Excuse me, it's my wife. | don't know what's come over her. Anna? Anna? - Have you seen my wife? - Um yes. She came here and went off on her horse. She's pregnant. Why did you let her go? - But I didn't know that. - Help me! - Gee up! Gee up! Come on, girl! - Gee up! Anna! Anna! Anna, my darling! Are you injured? Does it hurt? Did you fall? | don't remember anything, Jean. When I came to, I was on the ground. And the baby? Anna, remember, you're pregnant! Heavens, what have I done, Jean? You're hiding something from me, Anna. What's wrong? Sometimes... | have a feeling of anxiety... A fear that prevents me from breathing, | suffocate. What are you afraid of? When you're near me, I have no fears. I'm all right now. And the baby too. Dr schumann told me. | couldn't bear it, if something happened to you, darling. | won't do anything more to worry you, | promise. | haven't been able to tell you, but mr Dubois took my watches. | knew it! We'll soon have a proper house, Anna. Will you always love me? Whatever happens? Whatever happens. For the cases, | imitated headlights: Bugatti's, Chevrolet's and peugeot's. What do you think of that? That's all very well, but we must make watches for workers, not only bosses. A watch is a luxury object, too, gaspard. We must have several collections. We must aim at all classes! And the bosses are also workers, like it or not. Very funny. I prefer to join the real workers rather than hear that! He's incredible! I offered him a rise last week, he refused it. No compromise with gaspard. You take over the marketing. | would like to research water resistance. - You can count on me. - We're lagging behind our competitors. It's not a question of being the first, Jean. We must be the best. Wait! There's something else. My wife asked me to speak to you about Anna. - What's wrong? - She seems to be very tired. Anna's baby's due soon, that's normal! Perhaps you should spend more time with her. You work too much, Jean. What's that to do with you? International news: 1800 textile workers having stopped working... Two months ago to demand a minimum wage of 20 dollars a week... And shorter working hours... Everything alright, mama? Who are you talking to, mama? What's that, you're saying? | was speaking to the gardener. But the gardener isn't here! Yes, he is. He wasn't at all pleased. He wants to plant more roses and I've had enough of them. Don't you agree that one's always being pricked by them? And supposing we planted geraniums instead? Oh yes! Some geraniums, what a good idea! Geraniums in all sorts of colours. Afield of geraniums! Thank you, dearest. Now go and play with Charles and Marguerite. I want to rest. Off you go. - Enjoy your meal. - Same to you. Enjoy your meal. Charles, eat up, please. No. I'm not hungry. - What's the matter? - I mustn't tell you. If something's wrong, you must tell us. It's mama, she talks to herself as if she'd seen a ghost. - But the gardener was there! - He wasn't there at all. - Yes, he was. - Well, be quiet. Can you explain it, Anna? - Papa? - Yes, Emma? | saw the gardener. He was talking to mama. Charles, why are you telling such stories? - You know you're telling lies. - I'm not telling lies. Darling, what's wrong? Charles didn't lie. What do you mean? It's true. I do talk to myself. We all do that! Yes, but it's different with me. It's the baby in my belly. It talks to me the whole time. - It never stops. Do you understand? - No, not at all. It talks and talks and talks. | can't stand it anymore. It tells me horrible stories. Really horrible! - What are you talking about? - Stop it! Shut up! Stop talking! - Stop talking! - Anna, stop it, stop it! - Stop it! - Jean, let go of me, you're hurting me. - Be quiet! - Heavens, stop it! Calm down! - Let go of me! - Calm down! Let go of me! Well? Everything went alright. An easy birth and a lovely boy. My wife has been very restless for some time. Don't worry. All pregnant women are restless. If you knew what I went through with my wife! - You haven't noticed anything abnormal? - Nothing at all, my friend. And are you capable of telling me what's normal and what isn't in a woman? Cheer up! Be merry. Everything will be alright. Yes, everything will be alright. Three months later. Hello, Elisabeth. - Hello, Jean. - Thanks for coming so quickly. Since Louis's birth, Anna hasn't been the same. | must say, after 4 pregnancies, it's not surprising she's a bit topsy-turvy. You surely do know, how not to get a woman pregnant? My sweetie... Oh, how I've missed you! Are you sure I can leave? On only one condition, that you return on top form. Come on, lovey-dovies, we must go. Thanks. | love you, my love. Now, tell me! What's Paris like? How many men have you had there? Not a single one. I've taken up the women's' cause. That'll please gaspard. Excuse me. Well. Do you know that in France women can become barristers. I'd have liked that. To study and obtain a diploma like a man. After all, we must prove to them that we're not dimwits. I'd so like to know the world, like you do. See Paris one day. Don't you like it? Anna? - Anna, can you hear me? - I feel cold. - You don't warm me up. - What? - You're abandoning me! - Anna? - You're abandoning me. - What's that you're saying? I'm cold! Stop it! - Anna! Calm down! - Stop it! Calm down, Anna. - Anna, look at me! - The ice... I... - Eat it! - Anna! Wake up! - Eat it! - Anna! - Anna, look at me! - The ice... I... the ice... eat it! - Calm down, please. - Eat it! - Anna! - Thei... eat it! - Listen to me! - Eat it! - Anna, be quiet, please. - Eat it! - Eat it! - Anna, stop it. Eat it! Eat it! Anna! First of all, I'll ask you some questions, mrs schaeffer. | must try and understand what's happening to you. Alright? Do you eat enough? Do you sleep well? Nor do I, you know, I'm an insomniac. I've tried everything, reading, herbal teas, even counting sheep, nothing's any good. It's as if I were afraid of the dark, the night. When I was a child, my mother told me bedside stories. Perhaps that's what I'm missing. Do you tell your children bedtime stories? | used to. But not any more now. Do you sometimes feel someone is talking to you when you're alone? | thought they'd gone. Who? The voices... They came back... especially since Louis was in my belly. - And what do these voices tell you? - They want to harm me. And Louis too... there are... there are dozens of voices, children's voices. They keep on harrying me... before, they obeyed me when I asked them to be quiet. | implore you, doctor, help me. | don't want to go mad. | want to be a normal woman! | love my husband, my children! | implore you, please don't abandon me. I'll help you, madam, if you husband allows me to. That's what I'm here for. You can let go of my hands now. How are you feeling? - Like someone who's losing her head. - You'll be cured, Anna! Promise me you'll put up a fight. Promise me! Please! | promise you. I've nothing left. My family hates me. Nobody's waiting for me anywhere. You're my best friend, Anna. The little sister I never had. And gaspard? He still loves you, you know. What man would want to know the woman he loves can never have children. Because she had to abort at 17. To each her secret. Yes. To each her secret. 1... 2... 3! - Perhaps this time the watch will stay dry. - Don't dream. At the moment, we're testing the materials' resistance. - I must speak to you, Jean. - We're at work here. It's about Anna. I'm listening. Anna's not at all well. On the contrary. Since you've returned, Anna seems much better! It's not possible that you haven't noticed anything. - I went to the doctor with Anna. - Who gave you permission? Dr schumann is Anna's doctor. I'm speaking of a psychiatrist, Jean. A psychiatrist? Anna isn't mad. Doctor talbach finds her state very worrying. He must do certain tests. But as you know, here, he cannot treat her without her husband's permission. 1 thank you for your help, Elisabeth, but Anna has no need of a psychiatrist. - It's only a bad period, that's all. - A bad period? When will you open your eyes, Jean? You're so obsessed with your watches' ticking, you know how to regulate them so well, you haven't noticed Anna's brain's awry. Get out! | thought you loved her. I'll go with you to the doctor. Don't worry, darling. - When you're there... - I am there. - I'll always be there. - Do you swear it? | swear it. Charles! - But... - The butterfly... - Great! - Does he like coffee? He likes coffee. Good morning, children! - Good morning, mama! - Good morning! Good morning, darling. Good morning, héléne. Good morning, my lady. - You're very pretty, mama. - Thank you, darling. - I've slept very well. - Yes, you're very pretty. I'll deal with him. Good morning, baby! Good morning. Thank you. Where are you going? To the workshop. But yesterday you swore to me. | must go to work, Anna, as usual. I've a factory to run. Bye, my darling. Bye, papa. Bye, Marguerite. - Is it alright? - Oh yes. There's so much to do in this house. My lady! My lady! My lady! Please open the door! - Get out of the way. - Mama! Madam? Mama! Mama! Give him to me, madam. Please. Madam? Hand the baby to me. No! No! No! No! No! Your wife must stay here for some time, mr schaeffer. Until we've understood what's wrong with her. Can't she be treated at home? No, that's impossible. And it's even dangerous! Do you realize, there was nearly a tragedy? - You're not going to shut her up, are you? - Medicine has made great progress. We use new methods which respect the patient. | can assure you your wife... Will be in good hands here. She'll be treated, pampered, sustained. But is she... um... I mean is she...? Is she a lunatic? | haven't yet been able to give a diagnosis in her case. But certain... Mental illnesses can be treated. There are new treatments that sometimes lead to a cure. It's all my fault. | should have reacted earlier. You are not responsible for what goes on in your wife's brain, mr schaeffer. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here are the demand for admission... And the authorization for hospitalization. Please fill them in with great precision. Thank you. Isn't it Anna Von rohr who's just been brought in? Do you know my wife? You mentioned Anna Von rohr, didn't you? Sir! Isn't this the first time Anna's come here? - Answer me, for god's sake. - I swore not to say anything. Anna was afraid she'd lose you if you knew about it. Tell me everything. When was it? Well? Anna was 22. Her father had just died. She was deeply affected by it. She became moody, melancholic. So her mother decided to marry her off... And arranged things with a rich man in the area. Who was it? - I prefer not to know. Carry on! - She didn't want to be married. She got worse and worse. Sometimes she'd disappear on horseback for days. That was when you met. Shortly afterwards Anna was interned because... Please go on. She'd tried to drown herself in the lake. There's a recession, Jean. The planning must be reconsidered. 7 orders have already been cancelled. What's that you're saying? We must reduce the working hours and the salaries. - Are you mad? - It's not me, gaspard, it's the market. Cut the salaries, and I'll be the first to tell the workers to strike. Do you really want us to go bankrupt? You tell him, then! | told you so! - It's the end of capitalism. - That's enough, gaspard... Market crash. - Come on, mr walser, let's go. - Yes, I can walk by myself. My respects, madam. Mr walser, this is my husband Jean schaeffer. - How do you do. - How do you do. But why are you under supervision this morning? Genius is always persecuted, madam. Well! Let's go, mr walser! Come on! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Who is that? - A writer. - Are you jealous, darling? - Yes. You are so beautiful. There's something else. Dr talbach thinks you should stay a bit longer. But why? - I'm better. Everyone says so. - It's only a question of a few days. Nobody will tell me why I'm here. | don't remember anything. There was a problem with Louis. - What's happened to him? - Nothing. He's all right now, darling. I've done something to Louis? Is that it? Have I hurt him? - What have I done to him? - Nothing. I tell you he's all right now. You're lying. I'm not lying, Anna. I'm doing the best I can. I'm not your enemy, it's this thing inside your head. | must see Louis. Talk to talbach. | must see my children. Well? They've refused. Bastard bankers! After all they've made out of us. We can't go on paying the workers to do nothing. We must fire them. No. That's out of the question! We don't fire people in hard times. Oh! Ok. I'm working, can't you see that? What have you decided, Jean? | need time and silence. I'll manage to make this damned waterproof watch. We can't risk the factory's destiny all for the sake of a hypothetical discovery. I'll manage it. Marie-Annette! Hello, my little fellow! You're all by yourself! Where are your brothers and... Guess who I am? Elisabeth! What are you doing here? | missed you. - We've received lots of presents. - How pretty you are, Emma. - Charles, what did you get? - A small train. And you, Marguerite? A doll. What a lovely doll! How nice to see you, Elisabeth. Ok, children, let's have lunch. - Are you staying there, Louis? - He's already had lunch. That's for mama. That's right, darling. - It's a sort of wish, isn't it? - Yes. You can bring in the lunch, héléne. They're in bed. Thank you, Elisabeth. Your presence does them good. How's Anna? Doctor talbach says she's... Schizophrenic. You can hardly pronounce it. But in her letters she says such beautiful things. Sometimes when I visit her, she's normal, just as I've always known her. And sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. You must have faith, Jean. You. You must have faith. Good night. Good night, Elisabeth. Emma knitted that for you. She's a real little mother. You should see how she looks after Louis. I'm sorry. I didn't want to... Never mind. Oh, how lovely! I'm so afraid they think I've abandoned them. They know you love them. They know you'll be cured when you come home. I've written letters. | need you, too. | miss you so much. - I'm sorry, darling. - Don't stop. Stroke me. The state council of Bern authorized the creation of a commission... Who'll deal with a possible lowering of civil servants' salaries. Several loans for building to be undertaken in the areas most hit by the crisis and unemployment... In the jura region have been agreed on. Then, Mr... The cash boxes are empty. Either we must fire half our staff, or mido must close. - No, I refuse. - Nobody escapes the laws of economy. Even girard is on the edge of bankruptcy. We must do like the others. Precisely. Mido isn't an enterprise like others. Abraham is right. Sorry, gaspard, but my mind is set. - Then I shall leave. - Don't talk nonsense! You're different now. Wealth has changed you. Stop all that! We need you. I need you. No. You only have to get into your head once and for all... You won't make your waterproof watch and Anna will never come home. Shut up! You refuse to admit what everyone thinks! Your wonderful Anna no longer exists. She's mad! Nothing can be done! Stop it! Fascists, keep out! Fascists, keep out! Fascists, keep out! To the barracks! Rotters! To the barracks, soldiers all! To the barracks! It happened in plainpalais. The army sent out young recruits. It's unbelievable. How are you feeling, Anna? | miss my husband. | miss my children. And you? I'll be transferred tomorrow. - Why? - I've no idea... I'm either too mad, or not mad enough. They've no right to do that! You're my only friend here. It'll be alright. It'll be alright. I've prepared you about 20 letters. Here they are. But later you'll tell the truth. Well... Look after yourself, Anna. Look after yourself. Hello, Jean. Hello, Anna. - Set me free. - Are you sure? Yes... I've calmed down, now. Sit down. You know... Robert walser... - The writer... - Yes. The letters I've sent you... All these years. | didn't write a single one of them myself. It was Robert... Who wrote them and I copied them. Because... I... | wanted so much for you to think I'd get cured... Look at me! | don't want to go on pretending. I've no more strength. I'll never be cured, Jean. No. That's not true! Shut up! The children need a mother. And you need a wife. | want you to remarry! We'll divorce. Out of the question. I love you! You'll do it... Because you love me. I'll stand by you. For better or worse. I've an incurable disease, Jean! In-cur-able. Our best times lie behind us, darling. As long as I don't know that you and the children are happy, I'll not rest. You think that remarrying and telling the children... She's their new mama will make us happy? Not just anyone. I want you to marry Elisabeth. Are you alright? | can't do it, Abraham. Gaspard was right. You never listen to anybody. | can't do it. Why aren't you eating anymore? Have you lost your head? - I've never been so reasonable. - You're life is in danger. | don't care! If you won't divorce, | shall just let myself die. Then you'll be a widower. - And you can remarry. - I can't do it! Of course you can. I'll never leave this place. If we get divorced, I'll stop my hunger strike. Immediately. Please. Darling... Do you remember what you said to me. "He who would rather die..." - Or win... - Or win... Is rarely beaten... Anna knows exactly what she's doing. And I'd like to look after you and the children. | don't know if I'm capable... Of loving again. There are different ways of loving... We'll find ours. Of course... But of course! What's up? Cork! A material guaranteed impermeable! We must put cork on the pivot of the crown, like for a bottle. Come with me! Abraham! Abraham! It's waterproof! It's waterproof! You've found it, Jean! We've managed it! You and me! And gaspard. I've brought you something. This is a waterproof watch, darling. A waterproof watch. Do you remember? It doesn't matter. Emma is with me. Jean and Emma were to visit Anna for 25 years. I often accompanied them. Nobody except us knew anything about it. That's our secret. You don't talk about these things, they're so painful. Anna died aged 61. Jean followed her a few weeks later. They're buried next to each other. They'd never stopped loving one another.
