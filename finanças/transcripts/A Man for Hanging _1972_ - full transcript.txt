(adventurous western music) (dramatic orchestral music) (somber western music) - [Sally] Get in there, Red. (gate creaking) (suspenseful music) (somber western music) (quiet western music) (dramatic music) - What is it? What do you want? - Don't be frightened, honey, I'm not gonna scare you. Last thing in the world I wanna do is scare you. - What do you want here? - Tastes good after such a long walk. See, I was walkin' because I lost my horse. Went lame on me, had to shoot him. But then I saw you on top of the hill there, and I saw you bringing in those horses there. Figured maybe I could buy one from you. I'd pay good money for it. - We have no horses for sale. - Just what do you mean by that, you don't have no horses for sale? What do you call these here, huh? What about these? Huh? What about them? - I'll get my husband, he's in the house-- - Hold it. What have we got here, huh? Oh! Well now. Isn't that pretty? Locket, huh? (somber western music) Would that be your husband, honey? I think that's the man I saw riding out on that buckboard. Such a pretty good girl like you, such a liar! (Sally gasping) (Sally screaming) - [Ma] Sally! (Sally screaming) - [Ma] Get away from her! Stop it, get out of here! (Sally crying) - You wanna play rough, too, mama? Come on, come on. Come on. - [Ma] I'll kill you! Don't! - No! (Ma screaming) (dramatic music) (Red whinnying) (Sally moaning) (Sally gasping) (suspenseful music) (Sally gasping) - Giddup. You're fine lookin'. Yes, sir. Ha ha! (chickens cackling) (Sally whimpering) Now boy, let's go for a little ride. See you later, honey! (laughing) Giddup! (somber western music) (wagon rattling) - [Shep] Whoa! Sally, we're home! - Hey, come on, help me with these supplies before you go lookin' for your bride. - You know, if you would come when I asked you to, we wouldn't be late for supper. Sally's probably made as hell. - It wasn't my fault you couldn't find Cal. He's with Miss Brady all the time, I told you. - I wasn't with Miss Brady. I was having dinner at her boarding house with Willie and Jody Dunkirk. - Yeah well, it sure is funny how you always end up at Miss Brady's. - Well, they was talkin' about the bank robbery. She was tellin' us what she knew. - [Tom] Uh huh. - Cal's not the only reason we're late. You know that. - Hey, now if you're talkin' about that card game, I was winnin' at the time, and you know it. - [Shep] Yeah, at the time. At the time, what was gonna happen later? You're no match for those sharks in town. - [Tom] Oh, I don't know who's worse, you or Ma. - Always put the blame on ol' Cal, always my fault. I'm always the one. - [Tom] Ma! (dramatic music) - My god. (birds chirping) - Sally. Sally. Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally, Sally. - No more, no more! No more! (Sally yelling) - Sally, it's me, it's me! Sally, look at me! It's me! (Sally screaming) It's me, Sally, it's me, look! - Oh, Shep, Shep, Shep! - Sally, Sally! (Sally sobbing) - Shep, Shep, let's get her inside. (turkeys gobbling) (dramatic music) (Tom sobbing) (crows cawing) - What the hell's keepin' Shep? That killer could be, he's got a night's start on us already. - Can't just leave Sally. - Well, why not? The doc was here most of the night. Miss Brady's here now. Whoever did this could be halfway to the border by now. - Maybe, if that's where he's headed. - Well, now that just the point. We don't know where he's headed. - Well, at least we know what direction he's goin'. Tracks leading south over that ridge. - Now, Willie and Jody are the best damn trackers in this county. They'll pick up his trail soon enough. - Sure, some posse we got. - You're damned right. We are a posse, and I've been deputized to lead it, and that is exactly what I'm going to do. - Well, why didn't the sheriff come here himself? - He's leading a posse out of town after the bank robbers. - Well, how does he know it wasn't the bank robbers that done this? - That is what we're going to find out. - Not stayin' around here, we ain't, I'm goin' on alone. Get your hands-- - Now, you're part of this posse, and we stay together. - Get your hands off these reins, Cal, I'm goin' on alone. (dramatic western music) (somber western music) (adventurous western music) - Got these tracks about two miles up, Cal. He's headin' for the border, all right. - Hell, let's go! (hoofbeats clopping) - He's gonna kill that horse in this heat. - Yeah, Jody, but he's right. What we're chasin's got a hell of a lead on us. Gets to the border before we can catch him. - Willie, now you know this country better than any of us. There any water holes between here and the border? - Yeah, three or four, but they're either dried up, or ain't fit for drinkin' now. Nah, the only place for water will be Rinnel's Stage Station. That's about halfway between here and the border. - And a man on horseback couldn't make it from our place to the station without water. Ain't that right? - That's right. - Well, sir, I figure we oughta be spottin' him pretty soon now. - What the hell are you talkin' about, Cal? - Found that in the barn. Not one of ours. - Come on, let's go! Hyah, hyah! (drums beating) (somber western music) (adventurous western music) (somber western music) - All right, old fella. We'll rest for a little while here. We can't take too long, though. (adventurous western music) (somber western music) (rifle cocking) (hoofbeats clopping) (gunshot firing) (drums beating) - Hurry up, I'll cover. (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) - Come on, farmers, there's one for each of youse. (laughing) (gunshot firing) - That's the killer, and he's laughin' at us. - Jody's dead. (gunshots firing) He can pick us off one at a time with that rifle. - Hey, farmer, I gotta get movin'. Who's next? (laughing) (gunshots firing) - You damn fool. Gettin' killed ain't gonna help Ma. - Well, what are we gonna do? - I got an idea. You keep me covered. Now! (gunshots firing) Keep firin' at him, I wanna try somethin'. - What? - Go on. (gunshots firing) (Shep whistling) (gunshots firing) - Come on, Red. (Red snorts) (Shep whistling) (gunshot firing) (Shep whistling) Come on. You can leave any time you like, mister. That is, if you like walkin'. (gunshots firing) Now he has to make the first move. - You better get over with Tom. - Yeah. - Go ahead, now. (gunshots firing) - So you got his horse, now what? - Now we wait. - Wait? Shep, are you gonna give him a chance to slip away? - He's gotta come to us. Where's he gonna go without a horse and water? - There are four of us, Shep, we can circle him. - Yeah, and get separated. We already lost Jody. - No, you're always playin' it safe, ain't ya? - Let it be, Tom. - What's the matter, Shep? You afraid? - Shut up, damn it! Ain't I got enough on my mind, worryin' about Sally? - Talkin's easier than fightin' a killer, ain't it. - [Shep] Come back here, damn it! (gunshots firing) Tom! (gunshots firing) (rifle cocking) - No, stay, watch the horses, I'll go. (gunshots firing) - [Shep] Tom! - [Tom] Over here! - [Shep] What the hell do you think you're doin'? - Get your hands off me, Shep. I'm gonna get him! (Willie screaming) (somber western music) - [Shep] What the hell do you think you're doin'? - [Tom] Let go of me, Shep, I'm gonna get him! - [Shep] Like hell you are! - Tom, Shep! Stop it! (somber western music) - [Shep] Stop it, Tom! - Help! (gunshots firing) (somber western music) - Willie! (dramatic music) - Shep, Cal, he got the canteens! - Well, he didn't get his. It's half-full. It's not enough for the three of us, and the horses. We're gonna have to go back. - We can't, there's gotta be enough, we can make it. - Cal, we're gonna go on to that station. We're just gonna have to go easy, that's all. - All right. Let's take care of Willie and Jody, first. (sad music) Tom, Tom, take it easy, we've got a long way to go yet. - [Tom] A little faster. - Tom, remember these horses ain't had no water at all. (somber music) - Better walk the horses again. Come on, get off of 'em. It's mine. We better have the last of his. - Yeah. Go ahead. Well, we sure better get to that station pretty soon. - Let's go, come on. (splashing) - Welcome to Rinnel Station, mister! Be with you in a minute. - Kate? (eerie music) Kate, is that you? Kate? (somber western music) - I'm Ellen Rinnel. (laughing) - I'll be damned, you all look alike. (laughing) - Is there something I can do for you, mister? (somber western music) - Well, kind of depends on a lot of things, doesn't it? - Why don't I get my husband, here, let me get him. - Ain't here, means, means that right now, we're all alone. Just you and me. Now, why don't we just go on inside? Have a long conversation. - Fred! Fred! Fred! You can't do this. You can't be like that, mister! (crying) - Really amazing, you all look alike. Every damn one of you women look like her. Just like Kate. You know what bitch did to me? You wanna see what that bitch did to me? Huh, do ya? - No! No! (Ellen screaming) (dramatic music) - Look at that! (Ellen screaming) (dramatic music) - No! No! (Ellen screaming) No! (men grunting) (Ellen screaming) - Hold it! Drop that hook. Drop it! - What do you want from us? (tapping) - What's that? (tapping) - It's the weigh station. Telegraph key. - Isn't that convenient. You, come over here. Move! (tapping) Take that down, nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. - Oh god! (sobbing) (tapping) Fred. (Ellen sobbing) (dramatic music) (gunshot firing) (Ellen screaming) (sobbing) (somber music) (dramatic music) - All right, honey. You're gonna take all your clothes off. And I'm gonna sit here. (laughing) Very comfortable. And have me a real good show. Okay, you can start now. - No. - You know, I just could rock you up a little bit more. Would you like that, honey?` Would you like me to rock you up? Would you like that? - No! - Of course, I would do that again, you know that, don't you? - No, no, please, no, no. (laughing) - You know. You know, I think we should have us some music. (laughing) - Please don't, please don't hurt me, please. (eerie music) - You're all afraid of being hurt. I'd never hurt you. But you would rip my heart out, wouldn't you? You would rip my heart out and you'd just step on it, like a rotten tomato. Move, get those clothes off, now! Yes, I'm gonna make you understand me, Kate. - I'm not your Kate. - I loved you! - I'm not your Kate! I'm not your Kate! - Look what you've done. Look at it! (Ellen screaming) (birds chirping) (gunshot firing) - Over here! (gunshot firing) - Hold on, ain't got no money, just doin' some shootin'. - Well now. If that don't beat all. - You don't look like bandits, anyway. You look too tired. - I wonder, ma'am, if you could spare some water. - Sure. - Thank you. - Much obliged, miss. I'm Shep Ballenger, and this here's my brother, Tom. He's Deputy Cal Hartner. - Deputy. You after somebody? - Sure are, we've been after him for two days. - Oh well, I can tell you there ain't been nobody through here. - We're on our way to Rinnel Station. You happen to know the way? - I ought to, that's where I live. My brother-in-law's Fred Rinnel. My name is Liz. - Hey, well, could we, could we get some food and water at the station? - Sure, just follow me. We're always happy to help out the law. - Let's go. (soft guitar ballad music) (tapping) (banging) (ominous music) (door thuds) - Fred? (horse whinnying) Fred? (somber western music) (adventurous western music) - Deputy, it's over there. - Come on, Red. - Let's go, come on. (adventurous western music) (laughing and splashing) - I'll fix you something to eat. When you're finished, come on to the house. - Thanks! - Oh, I don't know when I've been so dry.

Ellen! Ellen! - He's crazy, rapin' women, ain't he? (Cal sighs) She's hurt bad. - See if you can get some water, some bandages. - Liz. Liz. Your sister needs bandagin', cleanin' up. You better get in there to her. Come on. Come on. - How many? How many more is he gonna kill before we get him? - She needs a doctor, fast. I'll see what I can do with that telegraph key. - Well, come on, let's get him out of here. - Well, he didn't miss a thing. He got this, too. Telegraph key. Well, take a look at this. - Avery Porter. A-P. - Hey, that was the initials on the canteen. - That means he was part of the gang that robbed the bank at Willow Springs. - Hey, I'll betcha, I'll betcha they're gonna meet up over the border. - Yeah, sure, bet he's carryin' the money with him, too. - Well. We're just gonna have to get goin'. - Wait a minute, what about Liz and Ellen? We an't just leave 'em here. - Well, Tom, Liz is just gonna have to take care of Ellen. Until some help comes. He's gettin' closer and closer to the border. - Tom, there's nothin' else we can do. - Let's take care of him, come on. (somber music) - Tom. Cal and I'll fill the canteens and take care of the horses. You better go tell the girl we're leavin'. - All right. How is she? - She don't even know who I am. She just stares through me. I think she's asleep, though. At least, her eyes are closed. - Is there anything I could do to help? - I better go telegraph into town, get a doctor. - Liz, he scratched the key before he left. Aren't there any neighbors around here? Anybody that could help you? What about the stage? Look, there's one due at six o'clock tonight. - They'll help us get her to a doctor. - Sorry, but we gotta go. - You're leaving? - I don't want to, but. Well, look. See, it's not one man we're after any more. It's a whole gang. We've gotta get 'em before they get to the border. - God, I wish I was ridin' with you! I'd get him for what he did to Ellen and Fred! - Look, your sister needs you now. We'll get him, I promise you. - But you're a posse, you're just a posse. I got a real stake in this-- - Now, wait a minute! He killed my ma. He beat up Shep's wife real bad. I want him just as much as you. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (quiet western music) But listen, listen to me. When you get him, you let me know. Will you promise me that? - Promise. I gotta go. You gonna be all right? - Tom. Thank you. Thank you for taking care of Fred. - I'll see you on the way back, I promise you. (quiet music) (galloping hoofbeats) - This ground's too hard to follow his trail. - Yeah. Both these roads lead to the border, too. - We're just gonna have to split up. You and Tom take that one. First one spots his tracks, fire a shot. - Good. Meet at Cougar Pass, later, too. Hey. You be careful, you hear? - You, too. Hyah! (fast western music) (somber western music) - Ellen. Ellen, it's Liz. - Liz? - Yeah, it's Liz. - Liz, is that you? - Yes, it's little Liz. - You better fix Fred supper. - No. - Oh, why do I hurt so? - It's all right (shushing). Gonna be all right. It'll be all right (shushing). - Oh, oh god, oh god, there was a man and a horse. He wore a mask. There was, Fred, there was Fred! (shrieking) - It's gonna be all right. (dramatic music) Ellen. Ellen. Ellen, Ellen. Ellen. Oh, please, oh please. Oh, please, don't die. (sobbing) Oh please. (hoofbeats clopping) (dramatic music) - Buenas tardes, senor. - Romero. Are you sure Senor Porter's coming? - Ay, hombre, he's headed for the meeting place now. - And the money, the money, did you see it? - Latigo, he has the money. He knows better than to try and fool the old friends. - Hey, Romero! Another sheriff! - Hey, another sheriff. Two sheriffs in the one day. (laughing) - I'm not a sheriff. I'm a US Deputy Marshall. - Oh, well that is much nicer, senor. I am only the sheriff, see? - A very recent sheriff. - I'm a deputy from Willow Springs. - Willow Springs! (laughing) - It's a very nice place, senor. We liked it very much. - My posse's ridin' after a masked bandit. - Posse, senor? (laughing) All right, all right, Paco, go look for his posse. And his horse. I think maybe he's lost the both of them. Masked bandit, you say? - (speaking in a foreign language) Senor Porter. - Si, si. We'll go to meet your masked friend, now. He has some money for us. - Lots of money. - As one sheriff to the other, I do not like the posse. I think you should know the last one we meet is no longer around. (laughing) - Around anywhere, Mr. Deputy. - I could only find the horse. Does he look like a posse to you, Romero? - [Cal] I was riding point. The posse'll be here, too. (speaking in a foreign language) - Kill him. (suspenseful music) - Momento. Hey, Romero! Paco is sheriff now, too, eh? (laughing) (dramatic music) (gunshot firing) - [Romero] Paco, stupido! (gunshots firing) (speaking in a foreign language) (gunshots firing) - Over there, quick! (dramatic music) - You make me very angry, senor! Paco was you friend! (gunshots firing) It's no use, amigo! No one is coming to help you! We have no posse! Very soon, you'll be joining your other sheriff friend now! (gunshots firing) (adventurous western music) - [Tom] It's Cal, they've got him pinned! (gunshots firing) - Be careful, there may be others! (gunshots firing) - Sit down. - It's all right. - Sit down! - All right. - Oh, Cal, are you all right? - Yeah, he just winged me, I'm okay, Tom. - What happened? - They were Porter's men. The one that just rode out's on his way to meet him now. - I'll get the horses. - I told you to be careful. - I came on 'em, they were camped here. They met up with Sheriff Milbank and the posse. They killed 'em all. Come on, let's go! - Sit down, this thing needs cleaning out first. - Oh, Shep, I'm all right. (somber music) (somber western music) (laughing) - [Shep] How does that feel? - [Cal] All right. - Let's go. Cal. Let me help you on the horse. - I can mount! All right, let's go! - Who's there? Are you Porter? - Amigo. Paco and Latigo, where are they? - They are dead, senor. It was very sad, too. We ambushed the posse from Willow Springs. The sheriff and his men, all dead. But it seems there was another posse. - Another posse? - Si, we were breaking the camp when the other posse find us. Latigo and Paco, they kill. With my life, I almost no make it. - [Porter] How long ago was this? - Do not worry, no one comes. I come over the Cougar Pass. If we leave quick, we can reach Los Altos before dark. - No no, no, we're gonna wait until dark. - Amigo. - Yeah? - Could I have some of the whiskey? - Yeah, have at it. - Gracias. - Now, since we're gonna wait until dark, I'll get me a little sleep. If anything happens, wake me up, huh? - Amigo. - [Porter] Yeah? - You still have the money, no? - [Porter] I have the money, yes, in the saddlebag. - In my head, I was thinking, with Paco and Latigo dead now, there is just the two of us, no? - [Porter] That's right, Romero, just you and me. - That's means it is two ways we split the money. - [Porter] Seems as though. - There's a dream I have always. (speaking in a foreign language) It's a grande hacienda, I will buy it. Aquila girls by the hundreds, I will bring them to work for me. It will be like heaven. Amigo. Mexico is a big land. A man could get lost in it. Start a new life. - [Porter] Romero. Why don't you shut up? - Si, senor. (quiet music) - That way. (hoofbeats clopping) (birds chirping) (somber music) (clicking) - [Porter] Amigo. - You got the wrong idea about me, my friend. I just want to look at the money. - Just turn around nice and slow. - It's just like you say, amigo. Mucho for the both of us. (gunshot firing) (eerie music) - It was a stupid thing to do, compadre. I was afraid you wouldn't make the split with me. I don't want any money. You take the money. Please, take the money. Please just take the money. (suspenseful music) Take the money, please take the money. (speaking in a foreign language) (gunshot firing) (rifle cocking) (shot firing) (rifle cocking) - I could have killed you with that one. But I want you to just think about dyin'. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute there. Who the hell are you, what are you doin' here? - My sister and her husband. You killed 'em both, and I'm gonna kill you. (laughing) - Honey, what makes you so sure it was me? Now, just wait a minute. I uh, well, (laughing). I wouldn't want you ever to do anything you, that you might be sorry for, honey. - I ain't gonna be sorry about nothin'. - You see that man right there? See that man? He's a bandit. (rifle cocking) (Porter laughing) You know, it's been a long time since a woman had the drop on me. (laughing) Now, just what am I gonna do with you? - Why don't you kill me? Ain't that what you always do with women? - I don't kill 'em all, honey. I may not even kill you. I gotta think about it, though. I gotta figure somethin' out. (laughing) 'Cause you're a fighter, and I love a good fight. - What do you know about fightin', mister? If you didn't have a rifle in your hands. (rifle clatters) - You go for that. Come on, honey. Come on, make your move. (laughing) Come on, yeah! (laughing) Now let's just see how much guts you've got, honey. (laughing) Come on, fight me, fight me! (hoofbeats galloping) (dramatic music) - It's Liz! Let her go, Porter! Let her go! - Unless you want this young lady to die, you better drop those guns. (laughing) Oh, I won't hurt her, as long as you do it like I say. Drop those guns! (laughing) - Don't, don't! Don't do it, he's gonna kill us anyway. - She's right. - I can't let him kill her. - [Liz] Don't, shoot him, kill him, shoot him! - Are you gonna drop it, farmer? Huh, you gonna drop that? - Shep, better do like he says. Drop it. - She's dead, I mean it, she's dead. Drop it! (somber music) (both men grunting) - Come on. - Got him! - Shep! Shep, stop it. - [Shep] Got him! (dramatic music) - It's not deep. - It's all right. - Here, hold this up against it. Hard. - Tom. Get the rope. And get a horse. We're gonna hang him. - Shep. Shep, you can't. Shep. - Cal. - You can't do this. - He ain't gonna kill anybody else. - Shep, I am a sworn law officer. We've got to take him back for trial. - Cal, you get away from me, I'm warnin' you. - Look at him, look at that. - Cal, keep away from me. All right, you, get up. Get up! - Look at the man. - Get up! - Look at him. - [Shep] Shut up! - [Cal] Shep! (grunting) Shep, listen to me, we've got to take him back for trial. - [Shep] We're gonna hang him. - Shep, you can't, it ain't right. You've got to stop this. You'll be killing just like he is. Stop it! - Quiet! I'm thinkin' of what he did to Ma and Sally. Get up there, mister! Get up on your horse! - Get up there! (somber music) - Shep, Shep, listen. I won't let you do this.
