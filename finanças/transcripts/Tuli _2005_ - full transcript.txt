The charm is more powerful. This one is more than 90, right? Look at it, it's stronger than a carabao. When the dead Christ passes by in front of their house, the procession is divided. There's a white horse that comes out and suddenly disappears. Let's go. Excuse us. Excuse. The most high. King of the world! The one who created the sun, the wind, and water! Revoke the thirst of the land, divide the warmth of the wind, conceive it with the cold! The blazing heaven! Nanding, what happened to you? Why are you laying here? Why is there blood on your face? You're annoying! Do you have your period? No! I'm pissed at home. No wonder. Why don't you get married, so you can leave your home? Who am I going to marry in the village? All the men here are rascals, if not, drunkards. What about Beneng? Doesn't he have a small crush on you? Beneng! Daisy Dumilat. What about you? Miss Maria Cecilia Bobochok Buraot! It's pungent! Weren't you there when Puroy got circumcised? They made me the one to hammer. Really?! Did you see how it looked like? How does it look like? I didn't look. What? Is that possible? How did you see? What? Is Puroy's big? Puroy's was dark. Beneng's was crooked. Ago's was looking up. And your big brother, Paeng's was soft. Soft? Let me play. Looks like your playmate's getting sleepy. Let it sleep. Grandma, is it true that every Good Friday, the Christ is dead? The power of the amulet is getting stronger. According to the story, yes. Grandma, is it true that you have an amulet? In what book did you read that? That's the news going around here. Grandpa passed it to you before he died. So what if there is? Grandma, you have an amulet? Do you really want to know? Yes! Defeat me in sungka. Then I'll tell you about the amulet of your Grandpa Nando. During the war, your Grandpa Nando became the leader of the guerillas. When the Japanese came here, they searched every house. They found a fierce bow-legged. They stole the rice, pigs, chickens. And they ran off in different directions. Run here, run there. The old and young, they were all afraid. Unfortunate for the young lady. What the people don't know, your Granda Nando has a power. The sword! The sword... is used in the temple of power in your body. Where is the power coming from, Grandma? The amulet came from the heart of a banana. Every night of Good Friday, if you wait for the leak of the dew, From the heart of the banana and it dripped on your mouth... That's the sign that you are blessed. But not all will receive. Only those who are deserving. How can you be deserving? If you have a great mission with life and if you're mistreated, And don't have the strength to fight, My father told me, My grandpa has an amulet. One black stone that fell from space. At the feet of the highlands, to test his amulet. All the bad elements came out from the woods. Folklore Giant? Giant, tikbalang, manananggal, tiyanak. What did he do? He flew? No! And then he took the butcher's knife and swinged it in the wind. Even if it was far. It hit them. Each one that was hit had disappeared. Where's the amulet? Didn't your father inherit it? It didn't work. Why? My grandpa was dying when he passed his amulet. He told me. If he spits out the amulet, Father had to swallow it afterwards. He wasn't able to swallow it right away? My father was a snob. Could you imagine that he washed the stone first, because there was phlegm covering it. Phlegm. Because I inherited the power, I will succeed! What? Here's yours. Matching! There's more. That's yours. Good evening, Miss Purita, just visiting Daisy. Good evening to you too, Beneng. Good evening! Just wait, okay? - Ka Manteng good evening. - It's already night time. Wow! Tell Pio to visit here in Paltok. So that we can have a drink. Of course. Is the one I circumcise already a cock? Of course, yes, sir. Let me see so that I can scale it. Oh, you're right. Come in, come in. These guys are already big. Your body is getting bigger, Ka Malting. It's okay, it's okay. Sit, sit down. Yes. Good evening to you, Daisy. You don't have to do this. We will be punished again. What did you say? I'm gonna close the door. What for? Don't close it so the guests will have some air. Entertain our guests, okay? I'll go ahead, I have to do some things. Sure, Ka Marting. How are you Daisy? We are very happy here. Anyway, our captain prepared a unique sinakulo. Let's join. Just go without me, I don't want to stay late at night. Come on, join with us. Bochok has someone with her, she's going to be the Sta. Elena. Yeah, yes. If you are thinking how you will get home. I will be the one to bring you home. No, it's okay, you might encounter some bad elements. I might have some conscience with you. Pio and I talked. You and Beneng are getting along well. That's good so that we will now be in-laws. Father, that's not one of my plans. Even in my dreams, I haven't thought of Beneng as my husband. What plans?! What else are you looking for to him? He's gonna inherit a big land for farming. Father, I'm the one to choose who's going to be my husband. What you? Damn. Why? Do you think I'm the one who chose whose going to be my wife? Malting, please don't fight in front of the food. Daisy, enough. Fuck. For me, my decision is final. Kill! Killl! Kill! Kill… What did he do wrong? We caught him stealing. And the punishment for him is death. Kill! Kill! Kill that girl, kill! Kill her! Kill! He's the first one to throw. I don't see any sins that he made. Put him in the cross… Set Barabas free. If that's what your judge is. I should wash my hands. If you're the real son of Lord, why don't you tell him to come down and save us? Fear what you are saying. This person didn't do anything wrong. Lord. In my death. Remember me. I'm telling you this now. I'll be with you in the paradise. Uncircumcised! Nanding is still uncircumcised! Damn Nanding, you're still uncircumcised! Uncircumcised! Nanding is uncircumcised! Uncircumcised. Hey let's go! He's uncircumcised. Christ is still uncircumcised! What did you do to my sister? Hey, bro! Enough! What is this?! That's enough! Your child is a bastard! Got Botchok pregnant. I'm going to marry her anyway! You should. You're rowdy! Enough, bro! What is happening here? Please respect my home. You didn't even respect the Holy Week! Continue the ball! With the letter I! Two Marias kneeling! Double two. Bingo! This is bingo! Bingo! It's time. It's Good Friday today. The 13th. Open the palm of nature. Where the power sleeps. Nanding. You deserve to have one. How? Look for the tree. There's the biggest heart, then… Hey, Daisy. Were you able to buy? What? The alcohol. Were you able to buy? With that condition? It will no longer have an effect on you. What did you say? What did you say? You are already fighting back? What? You can already fight back? Can you already fight me? - Okay. - I don't fight a drunk person. - Malteng! - Just try, so I could bring you back to where you belong. - Damn you. - What's wrong with you two? I am just asking that girl. - I did answer you. - Enough. Look at how she answers. Daisy, get inside. Why will I get inside? It should be him, so he could no longer cause trouble. Malting! Malting. Malting, oh my goodness. What is happening to you? Daisy, help your father. Because he keeps on drinking. Let's go. Get out. There! Hey, brother-in-law. Sorry. Why? Why? How dare he. He suddenly left without saying anything. I already warned you. I told you, those men are useless. I love him. Love? Are you dumb? You are so dumb. He left you, right? What should I do now? What do you mean, what will you do now? Then, nothing. You can't follow him wherever he is. Enough. Stop crying. What do you want, my child? Bottle of milk? You are really crazy, all the time. What do you want? I'll replace Puroy. What? I'll make you my wife. What? I don't understand. I'll make you my wife. Let's show those men here, that our lives won't just depend on their balls. How will you make me your wife? May I come in? Of course. I have something to give you. What's that? That's special because I personally made that. Hey, thank you. You should have not bothered.

Ka Malteng, are you drinking alcohol? Day and night. What's my illness? What I'm seeing is, you have the symptoms of cirrhosis. It's the failure of the liver. It is because of over drinking of alcohol. Doctor, is it dangerous? We need to have it checked. So we could be sure. For now, he needs to rest. And Ka Malteng, don't drink alcohol anymore. Not even a drop. To whom did this come from? From Puroy, Puroy. From Puroy? - Bastard, come here! - Father. - You are making me a fool. - Father. You're a bastard. - You have another man again. - Father, I'm not doing anything wrong. You are like changing sanitary pads. You are like changing sanitary pads. Father, enough please. Your sister, the summer is not yet over, yet already getting itchy. - Hand me that scissors. - I'm not doing anything wrong. Father, don't. Father, don't. - Father. - Help me. Father, Help me. Father, I don't have... Father, don't. Not my hair please. If your mother was alive, She might have killed you. Father, enough please. Father. Enough, please. He was supposed to make me bald. Maybe, you have done something wrong? Well, okay. If you want, you can live here for the meantime. Thank you. Let's play. Let's play. Sungka? Playhouse. I am the father, you are the mother. Daisy, your father already left us. Maybe, they heard us last night. I'm feeling guilty, again. Why? Did we do something bad? But, you did not feel guilty when you did it with Puroy. It's not like that. It was different. It's different because he's a man. Stop that. Don't be like that. I also like it. If you want, we could start living together. Even my mother would curse me. Ouch! I already love you. Hey, may I see your scar on your butt. My butt is smooth. - Oh really? No, it's not. - I peeped a while ago. - I saw it. - Enough. There's none. My butt is clean. I don't want anymore. I don't want anymore. - There's none. - Yes, there is. What does it look like? Shame on you! No, it's not. Look at Mother. She's crying again. Widows are really like that. They don't forget easily. Let's make her happy. Don't, let it be. That would pass. What I mean, let's give her something that would entertain her. Like? Why don't you give her a grandchild? Foolish. What? I will make you pregnant? You'll be pregnant. Can you stop, please. I am really serious. You know what, my father. When he knew that I was going to be pregnant. He didn't really get mad. Because, he thought he's going to have a grandchild. Like a consolation. How? Immaculate Conception? Why? Aren't there other men in the lowland? And just a child. No marriage. No exasperation. Think about it first. And besides, I won't be jealous. Good morning, Grandma Tuwa. Good morning. May the Creator bless you. Is Nanding there? At home. Why? Do you need something? I would just like to borrow a tool for the stove. You better hurry up. I know he'll be hunting. You might not be able to catch him. Daisy? Nanding. I'll be frank. I need a child. And I have chosen you to be the father. What? What will you do with the child? Take care of him. Raise him. I beg you, don't make it hard for me. Don't worry. No one will know. I will not chase after you. Just give me a child. I will no longer bother you. Maybe you are just being enchanted by the amulet. What are you talking about? Why me? You are the only one that my father has not circumcised. Because of that. You should be the one. One more. You are the foe of Benny, right? Yes. But? They want to make me a wife, get pregnant. Be the first, before he does. I have something to ask you. I hope you won't get mad. Go on. Why didn't you have circumcision? Whatever your reason is, I would understand. I have witnessed how my father was betrayed and killed. There were two bandits. Both were armed with bolos. They thrust him without mercy at the back. He was gushing blood. It pooled on the ground, flowing towards my feet. Well, bro. I'll prove to you that Daisy is a real woman. I can have her say, "Yes" tonight. It's up to you, bro. Father has high blood pressure. I told you. Do an evil action. Stupid. I can get her because of my great skill. Alright, alright. It's up to you. ♪ In your arms, ♪ ♪ sadness is perished. ♪ ♪ All my distress were changed. ♪ ♪ Every time I kiss ♪ ♪ your fragrant cheek, ♪ ♪ As if I'm stepping in heaven. ♪ Your pregnancy is the issue in the lowlands. Who's the father, Daisy? I don't understand you anymore. It's Nanding. Ouch! Who is Nanding? The grandson of Grandma Tuwa. The one who was undressed during the Passion play. The uncircumcised. Ouch! Mother. I am not ashamed of my situation right now. I may have not chosen to be a woman. I want to feel how to be a mother. Like you, loving, caring. I want, I want to experience singing a lullaby to a sleeping child. To wake up in the morning. I want to see the smile of a child caressing. To be a mother even without a husband. And we will be happier here. If there is a kid. I would choose Nanding. Because he is different among other men here in the lowland. Your son was greeted by someone. By whom? Two women. Have you and your son gone to Paltok? No. I can't be wrong. The alum is saying of two women from Paltok. This is what my reading is. Have some bread and rice cake. Hey, grandchildren, the plague is there. Get inside. Sickness is very rampant nowadays. Quick. So, is it unsalable today? No one wants to buy from us. My God, Ondoy. My God. Neighbors, help me. My son is having convulsions. Help me, Ondoy is having convulsions. Neighbors, help me! Ondoy is having convulsions. Wait for me for a while. Let me handle my daughter. Mother, Botchok. There are people coming. Botchok. Captain, what's the problem? Can't you see? The whole barrio is against their relationship. Botchok, you better get down there. Do you want me to go up there? Friend Filemon, maybe we can talk about this. Hey, consensual mother. You are the reason why children are getting sick here. Hey, talkative mother. We don't know what you are talking about. What, you don't know? You lesbian. You made Botchok your wife. You brought bad luck here. We just got affected by the punishment of God. That's right, that's right. Quiet, enough. Nothing can be resolved without talking. Aling Purita, I agree with them. This chaos will not end, unless you return Botchok. Father, I love Daisy. Leave us alone. What love? If that was a man, I could have allowed you. Botchok, come with us. We know that Puroy has hurt you. But, there are lots of men there. Daisy, don't worry. We will not know whoever had you pregnant. Right, my fellows? Yes... You fool. You don't really care whoever the father of my child is. You just want to be pregnant by anyone. And you want us to just keep quiet. You did not respect the memory of Ka Malteng. Right! Come here. I'll kill you. - Get out of my way. - No! Wait. I'm going to get my daughter. Botchok, get down, bastard, you both are pigs. What? You will not go down? You bastard. - Get out. - Ouch! No! Daisy, help me. Hey. Help. Let's go home. Paeng, Paeng. Daisy, Daisy, let's talk. Daisy, Daisy, Daisy, no. Bastard. Hey, uncircumcised. Do not interfere. Before you could be a hero. Be circumcised first. This Nanding interfered. Go back to your grandmother. The cow's milk might get spoiled. Captain, it's Nanding's right to protect his child and the mother. You are uncircumcised. Nanding, you are the culprit. Yes, captain. Daisy. Is there anyone else? Could it be Botchok? My goodness. We have nothing to argue about here. Well, well. All of you, go back to the lowland. People who are stroke with lightning. Grandma, thank you for the amulet. It was a great help for me. Whatever you have done that was surprising, it was because of your inborn skill. I placed the amulet here. But this, has the power. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, Now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Mother, I apologize. You don't have to explain, my child. I don't need to hear it. Just follow what's in your heart. Don't be controlled, don't be forced. And with your beauty, what else would a mother look for. And with interest. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Mom Purita, Mom Purita. Nanding, you got a son. That would make many women cry. He is still small, but it's already big.
