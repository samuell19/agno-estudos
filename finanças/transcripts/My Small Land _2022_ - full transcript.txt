Nothing has changed. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Did you make this? At that time, it was only you. Now we have more. I see. When you don't speak Japanese, we have to gesture to each other. But not for long. Yes, it's thanks to you. Thanks to your hard work. Not everyone tries as hard as you. Studying for the college entrance exam? Yes. I want to be a teacher like you. Heh. I'm flattered. I'm here if you need to talk. Thank you. Robin... Is he talking at home? The thing is... He rarely spoke in school. He never talked to his classmates. Was he being bullied like I was? It's a little different. Robin He said he is an alien. Classmates called him a liar. Then, he started avoiding them. Why do you say that? Because they ask me where I come from. You don't know what to say, right? Am I an alien? No. Then, neither do you. You know who you are. Be proud and tell them you're Kurdish. Right? Yeah. The place where I was born... ...has many stones. Like this? Yeah. There's nothing to do in the village other than kicking stones. This stone. And the Kurdish stone. All the same. This one too? Yeah. Our country ...is here. Here? That's why... stones are everywhere around us all the time. Your refugee application has been rejected. I am... a refugee. I can explain again and again. What else do you need? Some kind of proof? I don't have the answer. Soldiers burned my house. I was arrested for participating in demonstrations. I got these scars when they tortured me. I can't change the decision. Look carefully. Look! Can't you see I'm a refugee? Stop it! You'll make things worse. Your current residence card is invalid. Now, about the interim release. Instead of being detained as an illegal foreigner, You'll be free under certain conditions. First, you are not allowed to get a job. Second, don't go... Mr. Yamanaka. What is your advice as our attorney? I know that doesn't make sense to a refugee like you. But please, just obey the rules of interim release. And stay healthy. If you see a doctor even with just a cold, it may cost you 10k yen or more. We can't leave Saitama, can we? I want to go to Harajuku. You can leave the prefecture with permission from Immigration. But not for fun. My life is over. You each can choose 3 toppings. That! What do you want? Don't eat loudly. It tastes better that way. I don't like it. Have you ever tried it? No. So, you wouldn't know. Right? It tastes so much better when you're not sipping it. That's right. It tastes better. How? Yummy. Really? Yummy? I want to study in Tokyo with Tomo. You too? Tokyo? If I can. Of course. Listen. - I've been thinking. - About what? What if we share an apartment? What? - You're a genius. - I know. But, sorry. I want to move in with Tomo. What? Are you serious? Then, I'll move in with Salya. I don't think she would. - Is that true? - No. But you'll make me do all the housework. Of course. - Who knows? - Just refuse. We must stay close. What about Shibuya? Shibuya? I heard the place is crowded. You heard? You don't know anything about Tokyo? Sorry for the wait. You look like a doll. No. Where do you come from? Germany. Really? You speak Japanese very well. I can't believe you're a foreigner. Thank you. 860 yen. Will you return to your country one day? I want to live here in Japan. I wish you success. Thank you. Here's the change, 140 yen, and the receipt. Thank you Are you done? Yeah. Here. Our new arrival! You noticed? My treat. - Eat it. - Thank you. Have you washed it? Tomatoes. It's a beautiful color. Really? Yes. I like red. It's delicious. Yum! Listen... I... actually... I'm not German. During World Cup when I was in elementary school, my classmate asked me which country do I support I said Germany. Germany has a strong team. But... I want to support Japan like everyone else. But I think it'd be weird if I said Japan. You're thinking too much. I can't help it. Anyway everyone started to think I'm German. I didn't deny it. I also started saying I'm German. Where are you from? I'm Kurdish. I'm sure you've never heard of it. Kurdish? Sorry, I don't know. No one knows. Have they ever been in World Cup? Nope. We can't. Don't have a strong team? No. So... Hands are colored red in Kurdish marriages. By relatives. When I see my red hand, it reminds me that I am Kurdish. Same here. When I see blue and orange, it reminds me of my uncle. It sucks. Not even a little. Really sucks. There's something here. Good grief. You're the first person I told about this. You won't regret it? No. I see. Which color? - Orange. - Orange. What kind of art is this? I don't know. I like this. But I want to study art. In art college. I want to be an elementary school teacher. I'm saving up for it. I eat too many lemons. - Too much cabbage. - Yes. The rain is getting heavier. Wait! Wait! Here. Thank you. Hey, what's this? Many Kurds don't speak Japanese. I help them. You're already a teacher. Not like that. Who are you? There's nothing to steal. That's my shirt. Oh... I'm... and Salya... Salya! Who's he? We're doing a presentation about Kurdish. He came to work on it. Sorry. I'll ask him to leave. Stay and eat with us. No... You're interested in Kurds, right? Yes. Thank you Delicious. It's delicious. Do you live near? No. I live in Tokyo. But you went to school in Saitama? - I'm... - Yes, from Tokyo. He's a rare case. What do you want to know about Kurds? For example... your country... Where is it located? Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq. Kurds lived in that region before those countries existed. But after the war... What is "sınır" in Japanese? Border. The borderline was established and the Kurds must be separated. We have no country to call our own. I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm glad that you're interested in our nation. Want to drink? No... I'm underage. I'm kidding. Come on, Dad. Here! Awesome! Come on. Eat. You like Welat. He's like a son to me. Salya, he's your future husband. Ali! Not now, but someday. Was Fatma younger than Salya when you married her? Yes. She was 16 years old. Arranged by your parents? Yeah. Liar. You two fell in love. Speak in Kurdish. Then, Salya will not understand. Mazrum fell in love with her at first sight. I'm happy to be able to send her remains back to our homeland. Cheers to Fatma! See you later. I'll go first. You don't want to go see the campus? How about you? I want to go to Osaka school. Osaka? Yeah. There's an art college I want to get into. I haven't told my mom yet. I really want to see Osaka. I've never been there. Neither have I. I wonder how it is. Osaka? There's Dotonbori. Okonomiyaki. Takoyaki. - Takoyaki. - Takoyaki. - Good. - I want to eat it. Yeah! Come with me. I... can't go. I see. Sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Absolutely no need. Don't apologize. What is it? Actually I'm not allowed to come to Tokyo. Because of my visa. I need permission to leave Saitama. Why suddenly? We're not approved as refugees. When I was little, my father was persecuted and fled to Japan. He'll be arrested if he returns. In Japan, is your family safe? Yeah. But our lives are limited. It sucks... That's how it is. Not the way it should be! Kurdish greeting... For hello and goodbye. Which one is that now? What do you think? Hold out your hand. Cold. Wait. Cold. Ready? One two... Looks good. Good. We better run. Come on, quickly. I'll be fine now. Thank you. Then... See you. Hey... I want to go to Osaka with you. Okay. See you. I'm home. Come here! Where are you going? With a friend. That man? We're just friends. Just friends? Really? Yes. Nothing embarrassing? No. Want to swear to God? I swear. Don't meet him again. Let's just eat. Go wash your hands. No. Come on, quickly. Why can't I meet him anymore? Why do I have to do this? You are Kurdish. Wherever you are, you are Kurdish. Prayer is a part of us. It's enough. My bicycle... Hello. Do you work here? May I see your ID? Well... There is no way to survive without work. But it's hard to get out once you're caught. When will he be released? He might be here ...forever. Can we go camping? I don't think so. I can take you camping. No, thank you. Of course. You want to go with your father. Anyway. I suggest you re-apply for refugee status. And take your case to court. We have to prove that you deserve asylum. Thank you. But that takes a long time, doesn't it? Yes. Nothing will change right away. What will happen to us? You didn't do anything wrong, did you? No. We'll be fine, right? We can live in Japan, right? Don't worry. Don't be discouraged. Take care of them. Yes. And our Kurdish friends too. You must be strong. I'm counting on you. All right. See you. Where's my bike? Ouch! My goodness. It's hot here. What is it? Where did you go? Club activities? Shut it. You're not my mother. Don't be mean. Are you still helping the Kurds? Of course. Just say no. We have our own problems. Can't. Their Japanese doesn't improve because you do everything for them. Is it my fault? That's not what I meant, but... Then, you do something. It's none of my business. You're the one who asked for that. I'm home! My mother came back. Welcome back! - Hello. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. - Me too. Salya and her brother, Robin. Hello, Salya. Hello. Hello, Robin. Hello. Isn't this a face? It's a face. A dog? That's right. Awesome! I've never seen cutting like that. I think that's average. That's how we do it. You help your mother in the kitchen, huh? I cook with my father. My mother passed away. But she was the one who taught me how to cook. You carry on the tradition. Where do you come from? I'm Kurdish. Kurdish? That sounds cool. I also brought the taste of Iwate, my hometown. Just me and Sota. He didn't help me with the housework at all. He really loves his art. I love his art. - Really? - Yes. To be honest... I wanted him to get a regular job. You don't want him to be in art? It's okay. Parents are happy when their children are happy. He must follow his heart. He's lucky to have a mother like you. I'm sure your dad feels the same way. How's your dad? Have you called him? Won't he be worried? Yes, He's good. His dad is so cool. I want to meet him. He has a big beard. Hey. What is it? Are you okay? Our father is not at home now. You mean? Where is he? Immigration. He was detained by the Immigration Bureau. Why? They rejected his application for refugee status. He lost his visa. You too? Sorry, I can't imagine what it's like for you. Let's eat. It will get cold. Okay. Eat as much as you want. Take a bath and sleep here. Big bath? Well... Just normal. You can come any time. Thank you No. We're not allowed to come here. Why not? You're back. We're back. I brought this for you. You like Kofta, don't you? Thank you Hopefully, Mazrum will be back soon. What about your husband? Well... It's been two years. Two years... Have you written a letter to your father? Not yet. Write it down. He's worked so hard for you. For me? He wants to send you to college. No Scribbling I'm so sorry. You're a good employee. But... I can't let you work illegally. Your salary. And I gave a little extra. Don't tell anyone you work here. Besides that... about Sota... please stay away from him. Why? Her mother... She was worried. For his son and also you. Thank you. Wait! Take this. What is the problem? I'm fired. Illegal worker. Sorry. I'll talk to my uncle. Just forget it. And about Osaka Go alone. Why? Can't you just ask permission? I don't want to go anymore. Are you okay? I'm fine. No air-con but... the food is very cold. The best "Ho-spi-ta-bi-li-ty"! Sorry. I'm glad you're well enough to be sarcastic. Others will be very depressed. Then, why don't you take this case to court? You can do it if you want. How about you? I'll go back. What are you talking about? I can't live in this place. I'll go crazy. You know the dangers of going back. Yes. You said you would be caught. Japan made me leave. Yeah. I don't think that's right. So, we have to keep looking for ways to get you to stay. Think carefully. Don't worry. We will meet again. That will never happen. I have no place anywhere. It doesn't matter where I am. What about me? Where is our place? You who brought us here. Now you'll leave us? You're so selfish! Wait. Hey... What happened? I'm not accepted even with a recommendation? I'm sorry. The college said no. - Let's find another school that... - I can't even take the entrance test? You can take the exam. But you need a visa to be approved. I'll help you find another school. I just want to have a license to teach in elementary school. It means a lot to me. Okay. Try to keep an open mind and be positive. Let's work hard, okay? I... I have worked hard. Of course. My turn. What are you doing? Nothing. Thank you! I'm so relieved. She always passed with your notes. Yes, but I'm happy for her. You shouldn't be too busy studying. Have fun. You also need rest. Yeah It's fine. It's fine. Thank you! Here. Just this much? With your looks, you can earn a lot more. Just take advantage of your gift. What is that? Manami, what about Tomo? We broke up. What? College entrance is more important to him, so we broke up. Really? But Stop working like this. I have my reasons. Don't tell Shiori. I won't tell either. Let's buy the same t-shirt. Yeah. You're 2 months late on your rent. You have to move. I accept foreigners but not free. I'm sorry. Let your father know. I haven't seen him lately. We'll pay it soon. I promise. Sorry. This is all I have. My boss ran away. Thank you. You should ask Welat. No. He is there. He's your future husband. Don't say that. - Welat! Salya is here! - Stop! Salya, how are you? Nothing. You can talk to me. There's nothing to talk about. Don't you like me? Mazrum helped me come to Japan. I owe him a lot. I want to help you. We Kurds must stick together. No. I am different. You're Kurdish. It was awesome. I think it's perfect. - True! - We are great! Why are you doing this? Ah. You can't rely on your parents? Yeah. You're so young. It's hard. But your hard work will pay off in the end. Thank you. I want to help you. Order whatever you want. Can I have french fries please? Of course. By the way. Did you do the "extras"? A hug for 3 thousand yen? A kiss for 10 thousand yen? Fast money. Everyone does. Aren't these just mere greeting gestures for foreigners like you? I don't want to force you. I have to go. Wait. Just one hug. Five minutes. Five minutes? Why? Pay me first. I'll pay 10 thousand yen, even 20 thousand. This is okay, right? Don't worry. I'll not hurt you. Stop it! Ouch! You bitch! Get out from Japan! Hey! How are you? I'm fine. How about you? I'm fine. Well... About your job. I'm sorry. That's how it is. Take this. It really isn't much. It's not from my uncle or my mom. It's from me. Thank you But it's fine. Are you sure? I'm sure. Sorry, I can't think of anything else. I'm stupid. Hey, Robin isn't home yet. Since when? I think he's not here since afternoon. - I'll look over there. - I'll go there. Robin! Where are you? Robin! Robin! Didn't find him. Robin! - Robin! - Robin! Robin! Robin! Where did you go? I'm looking for stones. Stupid. You're more stupid. You're right. Why isn't daddy home? I don't know. Be careful! Yes! Here? Yeah. We used to make kebabs and go fishing. Every year. Sounds like fun. It seems that place is similar to where I was born. Here? I don't remember at all. But I remember getting stones for my birthday. The prettiest stone in the village. Unbelievable, right? Your dad is so cool. You think so? I don't know what he's thinking. Me too. I don't know what my mom's thinking. She... She said she is happy if you are happy. She said so? Life sucks, huh? Life sucks. I have to talk to her. Me too. Look. Here I go. New record! You suck. He can use this. It's getting colder. Yes. Look at this. "Salya Colak, Arin, Robin." "I'm Mazrum Colak. I have a family that I love." "I also have many good friends. I hope we can always be together." Dad Can't you convince him to stay? I wish I could. But he'd already made up his mind. Why? He'll be arrested if he goes back. He can't go back. You have to stop him. The thing is... He told me not to tell you, but... Visa has been granted to the children of foreigners who grew up in Japan. Heh? But their parents had to withdraw the visa application themselves in exchange for their children's visas. Then, when your dad heard about it he decides to return. There's an olive tree near our old house. Do you remember? At that time, when you were born I and your mom planted a tree together. Every year we plant a new tree to make a forest. But we were only able to plant five trees. We had to leave. What happened? I just expressed my desire for the freedom of Kurdish nation. You will be caught if you go back, right? Your mom... she's resting near those trees. She's alone. I'll go back for her. The Olive Tree may have grown this year. Do you still remember? Before we came here, we planted a tree together. Yeah... Close your eyes. What do you see? I don't know why, but... Ramen. The time we eat together. Are you hungry? No. From now on, eat whatever you want. Yes. Time's up. Wait! Your bike is at the construction site. May God give us a bright future. What's this? This is my country. This is a mountain and this is a river. This is our home. Bigger than this. What is this? Bridge to Tokyo, right? Hope Dad likes it. This is Dad. This is Mom. This is Arin. This is Salya. This is Sota. Thank you It's me. May God gave us a bright future.
