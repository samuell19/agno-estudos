OUT OF NATURE Toothbrush. And I have to remember the sleeping bag, of course. The inﬂatable pillow? No, I'll just use my sweater. I wonder when his hair went grey. How old can he be? 52 years? If so, he settled down early. Married with kids in his twenties. Maybe he's been sitting in that office all that time? God... I'm not that far away myself. Oh, he could easily be 65 or 66! Maybe that's his wife? I bet she likes to putter about the house, - - sewing new curtains and putting anti-slip underlays under the rugs. 66 years old... Almost thirty years until I get there. I could do lots in that time. I could even start over. I had such a massive hangover on Thursday! It was murder. Hi... I ended up having four or five tequilas, at least. - Didn't you puke? - I almost did. Let's go somewhere else tonight. - Monica wants to go to "Oscar's". - Because of Raymond. - Even Martin is better-looking. - Raymond's nicer than both of you! Remember how fat he was in school? Like a bowling ball! I'd kill for a beer! Finishing that damned report nearly killed me. - So "kill" is the Word of the Day? - Word of the Day... Please. Ladies first. The kid's at home, and Sigrid's not feeling well. - Say hello from us. - I will. Are you staying out long? Berit wants to stay out all night. - I could come when the kid's in bed. - Cool. - Text us and let us know. - Yes. Cool. - I'll do that. Talk to you later. - Cool. - Here. Enjoy your weekend. - You too. - Hi! Are you coming to see me? - Am I? So it seems. What can I do for you? Don't you have everything? Don't feel too sure about that. I'm going to Stavassgarden. Do you have a key available? - You're not going out this weekend? - Yes. Out into the wild. - Someone might join you up there. - You? No, but two younger girls have the other key. Hi... - Well, how are you? - Good, thanks. And yourself? - Not bad. - You're not down the pub, then? You're very observant. - Do you have something for me? - Something for you? - Maybe. - Do I have to fight you for it? Here we go. Thanks. - What's that? - I could tell you. But then I'd have to kill you. Will I see you later tonight? - Yes. - Good! Looking forward to it. Okay. See you. Bye now. - Have a nice trip. - Thanks. You too. I mean, have a nice weekend... Why did he just assume I wouldn't be going out? Because I have a kid? Wouldn't go with you anyway. You can just go fuck yourselves. No, I'll stay at home with my wife. Thanks for the offer, but Pm not joining the two of you. Do whatever you like. I don't give a shit. Sorry, have to go. I'll go enjoy the wilderness by myself, - - while Kjersti's fat arse grows fatter, and Raymond's tiny prick... And that nonexistent arse of yours. No buttocks! While my arse is... Which is better, "bum” or "arse"? "Arse" sounds vulgar. But "bum" sounds childish. "A nice bum." That's a baby's bottom, all smooth. An "arse" is hairy. Kjersti should see my bum! I could "forget" to dose the drapes at the shop while trying on tights. If Kjersti saw that, she'd be so wet that she'd forget her cunt is there. Maybe she'd think the shop was ﬂooded, but ifs just her wet cunt. Oops. Does my hard-on show? I'll check my mobile. 3.22 pm. Maybe I'll be out before Sigrid and Karsten come home? I could pack in no time. Just bring some spare clothes and a towel. I could even have time for a wank. - I'll put the food in the fridge. - Okay. - How did the pick-up go? - Fine. - Good day at work? - Yes. How was your day? - Really nice. - Good. Having guests over tonight? Or are you eating all that yourself? I'm going to the mountains, remember? - You haven't told me. - I think so. It's in the calendar. - You never write anything there. - I did. Monday. Until Sunday, is it? Two days at Stavassgarden! That's nice. - I'll be working out, running... - It's still nice, isn't it? - Move! - You just have to ask. - You can see what I'm holding. - No, I didn't. - Good day at the nursery? - Yes. - Did you play with Alva today? - Yes... I should take Karsten along. it's been a while since last time. - Are you bringing the tent? - A bit too early for TV, isn't it? Hey... Why don't you ask Vigdis to come over? - She's in Tanzania. - Tone, then? Maybe. Mads Mikkelsen is on that talk show tonight, I think. - You like him, don't you? - Yes... And Eva Joly. The two of them together, that ought to be... I don't want to watch TV any more. Okay. What would you like to do? How about drawing? Maybe Pd better stay? Just go for a short run instead? Stop by the shop on the way back so we can make wafﬂes? We could sit in bed and watch a movie, the three of us together. It's just for the weekend! There will be lots of other weekends. - Help me put on my shorts. - Sure. - Let's make wafﬂes when I get back. - Yeah! I should have gone out instead. Getting pissed would have been nice. Not thinking about what I was doing. Dancing with Kjersti. I could have had an afterparty at home. Made them all drinks. Irish Coffee with proper cream. With all the ladies surrounding me. Dancing and drinks all night long. Let's see... "Gone hiking in the mountains"? No, I can't write that. I said Pd join them after putting the kid to bed. And then suddenly I go hiking? That's... "Stayed at home"? That's too vague. "Fell asleep on the couch"? I don't have to give them a reason! "I can't come." "Have fun, and tell the others I said hello. Martin." Perfect. I have to give a reason. "Not feeling well." That's a good one. They'll accept it without thinking twice. Why do I always feel so guilty? If she wanted me to stay at home, why didn't she just say so? I should have taken Karsten along, to show her I can be responsible. I'm not trying to escape from that. I can't think of anything he and I can do together. When he's older, we can go together. Just him and me. We'll pitch a tent Make a fire. Look up at the stars at night. He'll tell me who he has a crush on. We'll talk about football. We could go to a Liverpool game. Stand on The Kop together. Sing at the top of our voices, along with the crowd. Is there something in my chest? Could it be lung cancer? It's never cancer. Just boring stuff. My knee hurts as well. And my hip. Wasn't there a little niggle? There... What if it's something that will cripple me for life? These trips are all that I live for. I couldn't cope with that. Right... Right... Right... Right... Right... Right... Enough with the "right”! I'm tired of thinking. Why can't I think of nothing? Just watch instead. White. Green. Some beige over there, and red. Yellowish brown. And some green. A little yellow. Mostly brown, really. Black and yellow... Right... Right... Right... One last song, then it's time to go to sleep. Way into the woods, there was a little cliff. I've never seen such a beautiful cliff. The cliff that lay way into the woods. On that little cliff there was a little tree. I've never seen such a beautiful tree. The tree on the cliff, the cliff that lay way into the woods. On that little three there was a little branch. I've never seen such a beautiful branch. The branch on the tree, the tree on the cliff, the cliff that lay way into the woods. Why do I have this bad feeling? Did something happen at work? No, at home, surely. Talking to Sigrid. And not being able to talk to Karsten. If I don't make any changes, this will be it. Salmon on Fridays, maybe tacos if I'm lucky. Sigrid being moved to tears by "Pop Idol" on TV. Me hiding my tears, not saying anything. My weekends spent watching her play with Karsten. I'll give him a push on the swings. He'll smile, but that's brief. Me going for a run in cold weather Sunday evenings. Back to boring work on Monday. Lunch with the same old bastards. I go home. Have dinner. Watch kids' TV. Put Karsten to bed. Sigrid's friends will come over, and we'll sit there smiling. Pretending. The girls go for a smoke, leaving me with their boring husbands. I'll excuse myself, sit on the loo and listen to them laughing - - at the same old jokes I've heard a million times. Maybe we'll have another baby. Sleepless nights. Nappy changing. And I'll go along with it. Out of loyalty. Duly bound. I need a wank. Do you want to take me from behind? Or should I suck you off? Hi! Hello. - Is everything all right? - Yes... Yes? - You look a little pale. - It's just, the hills are so steep. I needed a breather. - Coffee? - No thanks. - This view is great, isn't it? - Yes, it's... - Is that Rotdalsljonna up there? - It's Finnkéthaugen. Do you know why it's called that? It used to be a Finn... a Sami settlement. A "kate" is a house. Their houses were moved to the ethnographic museum in Tromso. Hey, come here! Oh... Don't let me disturb you. Happy hunting! Thanks. Come on! I was thinking about something nice... Oh, getting a divorce! I'd like to be all by myself. Why don'! more people do that? It's easy! A bit of paperwork, yes. And we'd have to share custody of Karsten. If Sigrid died, that would solve everything. People die in accidents every day. Unless she's just crippled. Then I'd be stuck for life. Maybe I should be crippled instead? Then I would be calling the shots. Yd get lots of sympathy and understanding. It might be kind of liberating! Not having to worry about my body. I could eat whatever I wanted and be as fat as Gilbert Grape's mum. I could be a freak show and support my family that way. I could join a circus, touring the world by railway. Yd need a car to myself, seated sideways because I'm so fat. With an open wall to enjoy the view while I gorge on cake and beer. Oh, there must be other ways to." Why don't I want to be a family man? I should be dreaming of building a cottage with Sigrid. Maybe I'm not cut out for family life? Am I deluding myself? I don't exactly daydream about doing things with them. Plans rarely work out as expected. Maybe it was just my own idea of what I was to be. I even phoned on having two kids and a happy family. I was going to be a super dad, always making my kids laugh. But I don't seem to have it in me. Maybe I've always been like this? Is it in my genes? I should just keep going as far as I can. I just want to be out here, and never go back. Maybe they're better off without me? I need to do something drastic. Quit my job. Leave Sigrid. Or just disappear. - Did he leave anything? - Nothing. - Didn't he say anything? - No. But looking back, I can see that he was unhappy. To think that there's fish in a puddle like this! Even though it freezes solid in winter, they still come back. Where do they go? Do they hibernate? Do they snuggle up under the ice, - - waiting to enjoy the spring sun like the rest of us? Should I move back to Tromso and live it up like I used to before? But everyone I know has moved away. And I don't want to live that close to mum again. Maybe it's not the city I miss, but the times? The constant feeling that something was coming? Especially Fridays. I would go home, shower and change. Play some Radiohead or Motorpsycho on my stereo. Yd have some coffee with Baileys and listen to the sounds outside. The night still young. Anything might happen. I'd have the feeling that I'd meet someone looking for a guy like me. And then Pd go out on the town. Get drunk and happy. Dance close to a girl, feeling her body against mine. She would whisper in my ear, inviting me back to hers. I'd follow her home, ﬂirting, talking and making out. We'd go inside, undress each other and have a laugh at my limp dick. Yd be too drunk. She'd say we could just sleep together. I don't know why, but I would always just go home. Sleep until four in the afternoon the next day. And then repeat the procedure next weekend. And the next. And the years would just pass without me noticing. Then l met Sigrid. That was different. We felt we were meant to be. We had Karsten and became a family I don't know what happened, but now I want out again. Hello? Hello! - Help! - Hello! Help! Daddy? Daddy? Damn it. Lots of weeds means lots of mud, doesn't it? I can't clean myself in that. There must be another lake close by. If I put on fresh clothes now, they'll smell of piss as well. I don't suppose there's anyone else out here? Sigrid Good morning! Enjoying yourself? I'll bloody well have a good chunk. I've burned lots of calories. I can indulge a little I could eat the entire bar... Hello! Feeling cold down there? I haven't shaved there for years. Neither has Sigrid. We've let ourselves go. H! ten Sigrid about it! That would get things going. "Having a whale of a time. Just had a lovely bath." "But I can't find my dick." "Need to dear the undergrowth..." I can't write that, can I? Oh, come on. We used to before! I'll throw in a winking smiley face. Could it really be that simple? Shave down below, have some good sex, and then everything's okay? I could die and rot just here, and become a tree. Or a worm. It could be eaten by a mouse, and then the mouse by an eagle. My spirit would pass into those animals. I would become that eagle. Looking down on the world from above. I would ﬂy into town. Pay Sigrid a visit. She would know it was me. Maybe my dad is out here somewhere, looking at me? If I close my eyes and concentrate, maybe he'll show up? Daddy? I'll be in my room. I don't know if I remember his voice. I remember the way he said my name, but nothing else, really. I remember the shirt collar tight around his neck. The smell of tobacco. Him just sitting there, in his recliner. What was on his mind? I don't know what kind of childhood he had. Or how he met my mum. She didn't know him that well either, I think. Nor does she know me. Well, at some level, I suppose. But she doesn't know how I really feel. It's not as if I call her every time something happens. Why bother her with it? Maybe Karsten feels the same way? Maybe there's lots he doesn't tell me. He keeps it to himself. Thoughts he doesn't share with anyone. Cut down my undergrowth as well. Didn't find your dick here either. Took a picture. See for yourself. I should have hugged her before I left. I didn't even hug her when I came home. Everything we had is gone. When you touch me, it's as if you do it out of duty. As if you think that I expect it of you. And when you look at me, it's with a sort of insistence. As if you're smiling for my sake, not because you're happy. I don't know what happened between us,- - but I don't think I love you as much as I used to. The first weeks after a divorce must be awful. But things work out. Life goes on. Lots of people get divorced. Maybe I'll be a better father if it's just me and Karsten? Maybe that's what it takes? We'd have to relate to each other. And I'd have every other week to myself. That would be so good. A whole week to myself. I could use the Playstation, drink beer and listen to music. I should buy that house by the sea. I could sit by the window and watch the waves late at night. And think of whatever comes to mind. Lie down on a big rock and feel the wind in my hair. I could spend a whole day reading a book. Immerse myself in its universe. That's what I want. Be alone long enough - - to feel what it's like to have me all to myself. That's when you start longing for company. Feel the physical need to have someone close. It's much more exciting getting to know people then. Maybe there will be a woman living in the house next door. Curious about her new neighbour, passing by on her way to the shore. Then one day I'm sitting outside, reading the paper and having coffee. We talk. And I make he! laugh. I invite her in for coffee. No, a glass of red wine. Then she'll know that I want her to slay a while. I show her the view from my window. Maybe she enjoys silences as well. I put on some music. To show my vulnerable side. Maybe I don't want to find someone new to be with. Just live for those moments, the first encounters. Didn't Kjersti mention... Two girls, wasn't it? Two nice girls who... Hello! I didn't expect to find others here. - Hi. I'm Martin. - I'm Helle. Mia. - I thought I'd be the only one here. - We came a couple of hours ago. - We're staying the night. - I'm staying the night as well. So we'll keep each other company. Good. I'm making some dinner. Have you eaten already? We ate some a while ago. Are you hungry? No, I don't want anything. - I'd like some, if there's enough. - Good! There's plenty of food. There's tinned food in the cupboards, by the way. You can help yourselves and pay when you give the key back. - How convenient! - Yes, it is... How do they keep tabs on that? You just remember what you took. There's a price list. Then there's no point in letting them know what you look. - Well, I would certainly like some. - Good! I'll just shower first. - Is there a shower? - Yes, it's outside. It's kind of cold... Which room is yours? That one? I'll have this, then. There's a switch over here if you... want to see. See you in a bit. I can't go to the shower wearing clothes. I'll wrap my towel around me. or is that showing off? I'll say something funny to hide the fact that I'm showing off... I'm not! Wearing just a towel is perfectly natural. My body is... okay. I'm not exactly David Beckham. They'll hardly suspect me of showing off. I'm just being practical. - Hi. - Hi. You're keeping the fire alive, I see. You can't really be modest when there's only one way out. I thought of climbing through the window, but... - Where did your friend go? - She's my sister. Half sister. She borrowed my iPhone and went to bed. - All right. Have a nice shower! - Thanks. You have nice hands. Do you think so? They're perfectly ordinary hands. Let me see. So you are half sisters. Same mother? Same father. Dad left us when I was four, and established a new family... This is what I want! I want my life to change. This is my chance. It can't go on like before. Something needs to change. Now I can do something irreversible. Let myself disappear into another person. Then my life has to change. I know what you mean. - Do you have any siblings? - No. No, I... I don't. - Is it okay if I get closer? - Yes... Sure. - Would you like some more? - Thanks. This is nice. - Let's go to your room. - Okay. I'll be right with you. - Could you close the window? - Sure. Maybe we ought to use a condom? - Maybe we ought to use a condom? - Okay. Yes, sure. Do you have one? - No. - No? But I can be careful, just... I can be careful. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Okay. - Hello. - Hi! Want to play some frisbee? - Ready? - Back up a little more. - Here? - That's good! Go ahead. English subtitles: Bjørn Meyer
