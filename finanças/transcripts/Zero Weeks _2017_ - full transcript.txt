[music playing] Middle-class Americans, even upper-middle-class Americans, live paycheck to paycheck. About half of all Americans said they couldn't scrounge up $2,000, even if they turned to their relatives for help. Many folks have expectations that the government guarantees them paid time off when they have a family emergency, and that's not the case. Financial fragility. . you may appear to have a middle-class lifestyle, but really, you're one pink slip or one car breakdown away from falling into real financial trouble. Paid leave. . it's something I never thought about until I was pregnant with my first child at a peak in my career. My doctor recommended that I take 12 weeks of maternity leave to heal after having my daughter. We're going to take you right now to the house where you're going to grow up. Mhm. And there's Momma Kaisa driving you home. Hi. I'm in rough shape. We just went to Walgreens to get me some Ibuprofen to take care of the pain I feel down below. But everywhere else, I just feel love. I consider myself well-versed in current events and public policy. But when it came to paid leave, I was misinformed. I assumed that I could take the 12 weeks, and my job would be held for me. What I discovered, because my company was small. . less than 50 employees. . I didn't qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act, the FMLA, which guarantees Americans 12 unpaid weeks of leave. Though I'd been a committed, valuable employee for 10 years, my company didn't have to do anything. I could have been forced to return to work within days of having my baby, or even the next day, in order to keep my job. Many women do. Almost all men do. To weather six weeks of unpaid leave, we had to deplete our savings. Then I went back to work. It was way too soon. Though I thought I'd be ready, I wasn't. Physically, emotionally, it was the most difficult thing I'd ever been through. I felt like my heart was living outside of my body, and I was abandoning her. My wife also didn't have any paid leave or unpaid leave. She had to go back to work within two days of bringing us home from the hospital. We couldn't be home when we both most needed to be. And we were the lucky ones. Millions of women go back to work within days of having a baby, barely able to walk. Millions more Americans drop out of the workforce prematurely to help an aging parent through a single surgery. There are workers who go bankrupt because they can't keep their job while battling cancer and parents forced to leave critically injured children in hospital rooms alone while they go back to work. Every day, Americans make the unconscionable choice. . do I keep my job or take the time needed to heal? Paid leave is part of the economic and social fabric of the entire industrialized world, except the United States of America. People know that the Western European countries are doing better on these policies than we are. But countries like Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria. . Vietnam has a generous paid leave policy. China has paid leave. Chad has a generous paid leave policy. We and only one other country are the only ones that don't have any paid leave. It's Papua New Guinea and the United States in a league of their own. We are a great nation. We do a lot of things very well. But in terms of paid family and medical leave, we are far, far, far behind. Why is it that the rest of the world has figured this out, and we haven't? We are a great and mighty country. The US boasts the world's largest economy and the most powerful military. But of the 39 industrialized countries, we rank 34th in life expectancy, 28th in gender equality, and dead last in maternal health, child health, and family-friendly policies. When it comes to happiness, we rank 19th. Hundreds of experts think paid leave is the missing piece. Paid family and medical leave differs from paid sick days, which we use for routine illnesses that require only a few days for recovery. Paid family leave covers a longer amount of time, usually weeks, to tend to a new child, serious illness, or aging family member. Small businesses overwhelmingly support it. 83% of Democrats support it. Paid family leave. . this is something that must happen. 71% of Republicans support it. You are from a right-leaning think tank, and you like this as well. We believe that the US needs a paid family leave policy at the federal level. I think that should be a national American policy, that we value women, that we value families, that we value new babies in this country. While this issue used to be on the fringe of our public discourse, it is now central to it. But while support for paid leave is prevalent, so is the misinformation surrounding it. And most people just don't think about paid leave until they need it. And at some point in their lives, most people will. Every worker in this country will have a life event, an ill family member, a sick spouse, a dying parent, or a new child. It's proven. Everyone can use paid family leave, everyone. Hi, Riley. Hi. This one says, Hop on Pop, by Dr. Seuss. "Mouse, house, mouse on house. House, mouse, house on mouse. " You see the mouse? It's carrying the house. "All tall, we are tall. All small, we are small. " Jasmine actually has been working with me for about four years. She's really good with the kids. She's very creative. The children all gravitate towards her. They love her to death. Good job, Charlotte. She's very patient. She's very in tune with the children's needs. And then this is some of her hair, right here. Oh. There you go. You want to help, Miss Victoria? When she told me she was pregnant, I was a little shocked. I was happy for her. My boyfriend, his name is Julian. We've been together for about two years now. My boyfriend is a full-time student, and he plays basketball. Julian wants to be a sports psychologist. And one day, I'm like, I want to work with kids. My plan is to marry Julian, nobody else, because I never want to change my last name, and we have the same last name. So that's perfect. So this is my keepsake chest for my daughter. This is mine when I was a baby that my mom did for me. Here's some pictures. And my brother cut my hair when I was little, so she kept my hair. My mom, my dad, and they just wrote some things, like how they felt when they first met me. Julian, he's pretty excited. But we're both new at this parent thing. I'm 20, and he's 22. They're so tiny. What really excites me about being a mom is doing everything that I didn't get to do with my mom. So I see other people on TV. I'm like, oh, I wish I did that with my mom, like the whole nails thing. My mom was always working, so we didn't always get a chance to do that. Charlotte took it. Charlotte took one. Yellow. Two yellow. Can I have one more yellow? OK. Working here for so long, this is my home. This is a second house to me. The kids, they're like my own kids. They're family. I don't want to have to go and find that somewhere else. As a small business owner, there is nowhere that we can go but besides our own pockets to provide any type of paid leave. Immediately, you start thinking about, OK, what am I going to do when she leaves? While she's on maternity leave, I'm not able to provide her any type of payment. So then it's like, I worry about, well, is she going to be OK? Hi, Amika? -Hi, yes. -Nice to meet you. Hi. So why don't you come on in, and we'll just sit down and chat, and then you can tell me a little bit more about yourself and all that you feel you can bring to the company? OK. My head is everywhere right now. I don't know what I'm going to do. It's very important to me to actually work and make money. I think I will probably be having to go back to work early as three weeks after I have her. If she hires somebody else in my place, she might actually start to really like her, and the kids might really gravitate to her. And I might not have a job to come back to after I have her. So that's really a big issue for me right now. I'm just thinking about how I'm going to afford things right now. Financially, I'll probably be using most of the money that I did save up that I was trying to save for a car. I do try to give my employees sick time. I take it into consideration. I'll just take the loss. But there's about so many losses a person can take before their business goes completely under. There's no funding. There's no grant that would be maybe a cushion that I could pull from when my employees need it. Everything comes from the cushion of my pockets. And once it's depleted, I won't be able to not only do for myself, but I wouldn't continue to be able to do for them, either. Paid family medical leave is a great equalizer for everyone, including for our communities and our businesses. While only 14% of people have access to this policy through their employer overall, only 5% of low-wage workers do. So many people worry that paid leave will sap business, hurt our economy. It's some kind of giant giveaway to families. The reality really is that it's a benefit people earn. Paid family leave is an insurance program. Here's how it works. We know this because it's already going in a few states. There's this very small payroll deduction that comes out of your paycheck. That goes into a big fund. And when you need paid family leave, you get paid out of this insurance fund. It's insurance. It's a fund that will pay for itself and would be there for all workers if they need it. During that time, your business can stop paying you. And then what do they do with that money? Well, they can hold onto the money, or they can use it to pay overtime to existing employees, or they can hire a temp. They have choices. A lot of them just hold onto the money. And so the statistics are showing that businesses love it. It can't be that whether or not you have access to paid leave depends on what employer you work for, what part of the country you live in. It can't be a boss lottery. The truth is, if we just leave it to employers, some employers will do it, and many won't. I mean, that's the system we have today. For small businesses in particular, these costs can be relatively high in comparison to large businesses. They often have few employees. Any individual employee leaving the workforce for a period of time is a challenge. And so having a national paid leave policy where everyone buys in, where it's an insurance plan, that makes it accessible to that worker who has three or four different jobs, to the small business that only has two or three employees. It makes it accessible to all companies, all employees, regardless of what kind of work they do. All right, so it's Christmas Eve. And we are about five minutes away from surprising my sister that I'm pregnant, though I think she suspects that I am, and Grandma, or Meme, and Dad, my parents, with the fact that it's twins. I think. . Seriously. . my mom. . what is she going to say? When it's twins? I think Courtney's. . Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Oh. . They're having twins. Are you fucking kidding me? -She's gonna flail everywhere. -And then lose her mind. -She's going to lose it. -God! Oh my god. Look under there. Oh my god. And I think Dad's going to do that thing, when he's pleasantly surprised. Wow. But we're going to surprise Grandma and Grandpa Wilson on Christmas Day. One, two, three. Tell my parents, well, we have one more gift for you guys. It's your first grandparent gift. Wait a minute. Are you telling us. . Look at the picture of them together. Oh shit. What? -Them? -Yeah. Oh shit. This used to be . Oh shit. Yeah. Oh, OK. Does everybody know it's twins? Yeah. We met at the University of Georgia my senior year, her sophomore year. This is our first date night. Remember when frosted tips were in? Oh, this was our first trip to Chicago, went ice skating, saw Blue Man Group. It's all coming back to me. Little did we know, we'd move here permanently eight years later? I have no idea what I'm going to do with little girls. You can think you're going to raise a little princess, and she turns into a tomboy, or you think, I'm going make her a tomboy. You end up with a closet filled with little princess dresses. I work in sales. Maternity leave was never really. . it never occurred to me. I never really researched it. And I actually asked my boss. He goes, well, I couldn't breastfeed, so that's why I didn't stay home. I'm just really excited. I've always known I was meant to be a mom. Today we just had our 18-week scan of the babies. And they are healthy and beautiful and growing perfectly. And I'm very, very happy. And Wrigley's happy, too. And this is what he does sometimes. He sits on my belly and protects the babies. My company's just really great. They do pay for one month paid maternity leave. I'll be able to take some time off, but I think it would be frowned upon. California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey have already had paid leave policies in their states for years, California for over a decade. In these states, employees pay into the plan. The cost to them is less than a cup of coffee per week. New York and Washington, DC, might be next in line to pass paid leave. A push to make paid family leave mandatory in New York state is gaining momentum now. Well, its opponents say this plan could be bad for business, but supporters say people should not have to choose between paying their bills and taking care of a newborn baby or sick loved one. Many of the same people fighting for paid leave in those places and all over the country are the same people who have been fighting for paid leave for decades. Are you from New York? You live in New York? Yeah. OK, so I want to talk to you about this great thing. We're getting people to sign postcards to their senator saying, yes, I want people to be able to be good parents and good children without going broke. OK, that's all I have to do to sign? -That's right. -OK. And then we'll send this in to your senators. -So this one says VNA. -OK. Get in touch with her. She's a visiting nurse, and she's probably got really good stories. OK, that's good. We're the state affiliate with the New York Paid Leave Coalition. We work with Ellen Bravo a lot, coordinate on some of the national bills. Depending on what size company you work for, 40% of the workforce doesn't even have a guarantee that they'll get their job back, much less that they'll get. . -After having a baby? -Yeah. -Oh my gosh. -I know. It does seem pretty amazing. This is what the law says. . Ellen Bravo has been advocating for paid leave since the early '80s. We cannot allow a parent's presence during the day in their toddler's hospital room to be their work number on a whiteboard because their family would take a financial hit otherwise. What you want is agents in here. Let's go back to the single mother with the two kids. She's the one who's working at the brewery because she needs to make a decent living. Companies are prospering because they treat people with respect. I don't know if you realize what you're saying. What you're saying. . I always realize what I'm saying. Well, all right. So I wanted to just end by telling you about Melissa Broome in Maryland, whose son recently had surgery, four years old, Owen. He's going to be OK. But as they led him on a red wagon through the halls, they saw a lot of kids who were much sicker. Owen didn't ask, why is that kid bald, or why is that kid hooked up to a machine? But he did ask, why is that kid alone, and where is that kid's mommy and daddy? It's going to be very difficult to cure all the ailments of those children. It should not be at all difficult to get bipartisan support so that every family knows they can have someone holding their hand and whispering in their ear when they're poked and prodded when they're ill. Thank you so much. The first major step toward paid leave was unpaid leave, the Family Medical Leave Act. Well, the FMLA was a great step in the early 90s. And I applaud President Clinton. It was a long time coming. The law guarantees the right of up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year when it's urgently needed at home. The Family and Medical Leave Act is unpaid leave. Unpaid, with a guarantee that you can get your job back. 40% of Americans don't even qualify for FMLA unpaid leave. You have to work for a company with 50 or more employees. You have to work more than 25 hours at the same job per week. So if you're part time or freelance, it doesn't apply to you. You have to have been there for over a year. And of those who do qualify, 48% can't take unpaid leave because they can't afford to go without a paycheck. That means only about 2 in 10 Americans can even take unpaid leave. When people think of paid family leave, they often think of it in the context of new mothers or new parents. Paid leave is important, first of all, if you have your own illness. What if you have an accident? What if you discover you have some serious chronic disease? Do you want some pizza? Yeah, and ice creams. Oh, pizza and ice creams? You going to wear pants tomorrow, your uniform pants, your homework pants? -No. -No? What are you going to wear? -Some dresses. -A dress? But it's going to be cold tomorrow. Go to college, because I say so. Watch me learn, learn. Watch me grow, grow. Forehead kiss. I have a three-year-old girl, Kehlani. We call her Diva. She answers to it. And that name follows her well. [ . ] that you've worked for your people. Let us now be instruments of your kingdom building on Earth, that the kingdom might come on Earth as it is in Heaven. [singing] I've always been spiritual, but when I got diagnosed with cancer and started going through the chemo and stuff, I've never called on Him so much in my life. I have too much to live for to just give up and be like, I can't do this. You're a butterfly? Yes, and I have wings. It's a whole lap. I'm hurting all day. I've known Kesha over 20 years, and she's my inspiration. She inspires me, her strength and everything she's gone through. It's painful for me to see her have to get up to go to work, knowing she's in pain. I have to work, no matter how I feel in the morning. You can go through my emails now, and then go through my draft box. I have so many emails that I have drafted up in the mornings getting ready to send to my supervisor and say, I'm not coming in, but then be like, I've gotta go in. There's times where I don't want to do it or really feel as though I can't do it. I can't pick you up. You know I can't pick you up. Yes you can. You say yes I can? I wish I could, honey. You know if Mommy could she would. We're tired. We was at the doggone circus last night. I am exhausted. Y'all ready? Come on, girls. I'm a program support assistant slash attendance coordinator for DC government. I've been with them for 19 years. Even though I'm the one with the cancer, and I have to deal with it, this life is not about me. This life doesn't even revolve around me. This revolves around my family, Kehlani. You want a muffin? Want a sandwich? I don't want her to suffer for what I'm going through, because she loves school. She goes to an all-girls school. Then she loves her teacher and is always like, Mom, I'm going to go see my girls. Yeah, we're going that way. We're going to cross over. Come on. These are Kehlani's little girlfriends, some of her classmates. This is Angel, and this is Jada. Their mom is going through a lot, also. So I'll just take them for. . Good morning. -Good to see you. -Mommy love you. It's going to be all right. Today is Tuesday. These are some extra supplies they needed for the classroom, for Ms. Darby's class. -Darby? -OK. -Uh-huh. -Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good day, pumpkin. Go ahead. Go ahead into your class, and you can warm up, baby. Breast cancer is very painful. When I first met with my oncologist, his recommendation was for me to go on disability throughout my whole treatment. Realistically, that's not something I could do. Disability would only pay me $1,600 a month. My rent is $1,100, electric, gas, all the necessities, groceries. I don't get no assistance from the government or anywhere. Everything comes out of my pocket. That worry of me choosing between work, kids, roof, food, that's an everyday struggle. You're looking gorgeous. Thank you. Always. FMLA was always an option. It covers the job, yes, but it's not bringing no paycheck in. I need a paycheck. I have to go to work. I went to work every day and left on my lunch break, and did radiation and went back to work. Most of the offices are not open on weekends, so there's no weekend appointments. Can I get a cup of hot lemon water? What did you say? A large cup of hot lemon water. People out here that's going through worse than what I'm going through, so no need to complain. I would get chemo that Thursday, go back and get the shot that Friday, and I had Saturday and Sunday to heal. So most of the time, I was back at work that Monday. Hi. You're a superstar today. I'm a superstar every day. Don't you know that? I'm still not healed from my surgery last year. So she's gone through several infections. Several times, she's had to be re-hospitalized. But then, when she goes in the hospital, that's when she gets her rest. If the employers would have just went on and gave me these two months off, I would be on a different level while I'm at work, instead of me being at work and just in constant pain and struggling to get my work done. Hi, pumpkin. Mommy. Hi. And it's beneficial for not just the employee, but it's really beneficial for the employer, also. You can't be very productive if you're in a lot of pain. You going to have a good day? I have a whole lot of healing to do, but I can't heal if I can't stay home to rest. I can't stay home to rest because I have bills to pay. Oh, be careful. What are you going to do? What are we going to do today? Come on. When I first had her, I was just so excited. She came out with so much hair, and it's just so pretty. And she has sandy brown hair, like I have. Look, Tory, you can wake up. Wake up so you can see your auntie. Oh, is she wearing jeans today? OK, Ashley. So have you been tired? I warned you you'd be tired for the rest of your life. Well, yes. I'm exhausted, pretty much. My naps are like long blinks. They're just like. . I wanted to go back to work, thinking I was going to be able to go back to work in two weeks. That was ridiculous. I couldn't sleep, not even the first day, just even worrying about her. I was nervous about everything. And then my body was really drained. Tory's dad, he's been really supportive, even though he's in school full time. But he also plays basketball full time. So he'll be leaving us for three days to go to Miami, but he'll be back. How's the job search going? I did online applications, like the mall. Yeah, so they had a cashier, fragrance advisor, makeup advisor, seasonal, temporary. I might even cry, probably, when I go back to work, because I'm used to being with her all the time. And she was with me for nine months. Right now, I think my body's just readjusting to back to its original state. I did think about having an abortion, but I couldn't do that. I'm so against it. I mean, I'm not against anybody else getting it, but for me, I just couldn't do it. And my mom, she didn't even want to have that conversation at all. Today I want to look for any jobs that are hiring. That's a "now hiring" sign right there. You can stop right here. Excuse me. Do you have any applications? This is my first time being a mom. I think it's going to be extremely hard to go back. Think about having a baby, a time that should be such a wonderful, joyful time for a woman, a family. Oftentimes, it results in a family plunging into poverty. It's so unpredictable. None of us know what's going to happen tomorrow. We don't know if we're going to have an accident. We don't know if the parent we love is going to need major heart surgery. Imagine what happens when those things occur, and you discover that you don't have the time off. You just don't expect to go into labor, obviously, six months in. From the moment her water broke, the girls were both born within 15 minutes. They were born about two, three minutes apart. Riley lived for 45 minutes to an hour. Ashlyn lived for four and a half hours. I remember when we knew we were going to lose them. Nurses kept saying, do you have a hat or a blanket that you'd like them to wear? And I kept saying, no, because I thought I had three months of pregnancy left. So I felt. . I don't know why. I think that's just a mom thing. I just felt really bad that I didn't have anything for them. But they have this volunteer group, I think, at the hospital that crochets them and stuff for situations like this. The doctor was looking at her, and he's like, you can't leave her alone. She needs someone to be with her all the time. I reached out to HR, and she said, well, it's three days for death of an immediate family member, but technically you get six days because there were two deaths. I think of six days, and I just wanted to be like, OK, do you want me to tell you what the first six days was like for us? Day one, you're holding your children while they die. Day two, you wake up, relive the nightmare all over again. You go home to package slips that you have a delivery, and it's two car seats from his aunt and uncle from our registry. Day three, you have to find some way to memorialize them, and you realize you never. . you don't want to do a funeral, and there's no time. So we had a little memorial, threw pink tulips into the lake and wrote letters to them. Day four, you have to get all the paperwork done. You have to go to the funeral home. Which means getting them. . you've got to pick out their. . Picking out an urn. Day five, his family left. Day six, my family left. So those were our six days. How did the United States become so out of sync with the rest of the world when it comes to paid leave? There is no simple answer. Consider it a mix of American individualism, Quaker capitalism, corporate lobbying, and an honorable fixation with our own bootstraps, all mixed with a splash of world history. A lot of it goes back to World War II. During World War II, you had a large number of women enter the workforce. Men left to go overseas. Women went into the factories. They went into the workplace. Now, in Europe, when the war ended, you had huge swaths of the population that were completely decimated. And so there was a need at that time not only for women to work and continue working but also for women to be bearing children just to, in essence, repopulate. And so Europe began to develop much better leave policies. Here, on the other hand, the issue just dissolved. And it wasn't really for another couple of decades before you even really started to get into any serious consideration of family leave as an important issue. Another reason paid leave has gotten stuck in the cogs of Washington. . its philosophy is similar to Medicare and Social Security. Everyone has to participate for it to work. That's a tough sell. The people of the United States have joined together in a great national program of protection for the common welfare. A little money coming in when earnings stops helps keep the wheels of industry turning. Social Security and Medicare were fervently debated before becoming law. These programs were decried as socialism. But today, both are overwhelmingly popular social safety nets that reflect our core values. Paid leave is at the heart of what we value most as a society, or at least what we say we value most. If you believe in family values, if you understand the worth of family. . America cannot long lead the family of nations if we fail the family here at home. And we see the family continue to break down. We need a serious discussion of family values, real family values. I've been working on this for more than three decades. There are number of reasons why the United States lags behind the rest of the world in paid leave, but a big one is the role of corporate lobbyists. This is really different from how other countries work, money in politics. They go to these politicians and say, we will call you anti-business if you support this policy. We've surveyed employers in California who have had paid leave for 10 years. Overwhelmingly, 90% of businesses said no negative impact on their bottom line or a positive impact. And they say, in terms of morale and retention and goodwill, 99% support it. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. In fact, more than half of the US workforce is employed by a small business. Most of these workers are not covered by the FMLA, let alone by paid leave. And despite the myth that paid leave hurts small businesses, many of them are offering some paid leave on their own, even though it's not required by law in their state. Even though we're smaller than a company size who gets FMLA, In These Times offers 13 weeks of fully paid maternity and paternity leave. Part of the reason for doing that was to maintain and keep employees. I think Rachel might have left if we had not had good maternity leave. She's really valuable to us because she just gets the magazine out every month. She's also our longest-time employee, so she has this incredible institutional memory. Certainly, Rachel could double her salary, possibly more than that with her experience. If they had no maternity policy, I would probably have definitely left. Hi, how are you doing? There's menus. We always hated working in restaurants where people would come to work sick. It was very acceptable to go to work sick. It would be interesting if there was a big sign in the restaurant when you walked in that said, the people who work here do not get paid if they're sick, so there's probably some sick people making your food right now. So we had started with two paid sick days for every employee per year. We added paternity leave about a year and a half later. -Maternity and paternity. -Right. Our employee, Mari, had a baby a couple of months ago. And she has been with us since the day we opened. Josh and Christine told me, you're going to have three months leave, oh, and you're going to have paid maternity leave. So when they said that, I had a huge amount of just stress just fall off me. I think about my future, but I don't see myself at another job. I see myself growing more with Honey Butter Fried Chicken. It usually works out. I mean, everybody sees the value in everybody taking time off. So whether you're taking paternity leave, or you're taking a vacation, or you're sick, we kinda just all pitch in and help out. I think that these are long-run expenses. Health insurance and paid time off certainly cost us money, but we built it into the structure of our business because it's not a viable business if you can't take care of the people that are working for you. We're a mechanical electrical design consulting firm. When I came here 18 months ago, there wasn't any paid leave. So STEM is Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. It's a male-dominated field. The ratio is roughly 85% men and 15% women. Studies tell us that 40% of women leave the engineering field around mid-career. Once they start wanting to have a family, they realize the conditions that exist in that industry don't support doing both. But to run a business, you have to be profitable. So we looked at cost. We had to understand that there's a cost for doing something, but there's also a cost for not doing something, a higher employee turnover, absenteeism. That's what led us to pass this leave benefit. We just found out not that long ago that we were going to have paid leave. And it's obviously very relevant to my situation. I feel like a big win when it comes to this paid family leave policy has to do with allowing our men to take some serious time off when they have children or when they have a sick family member. Encouraging the men to do it makes sure it's OK for the women to do it and they don't feel like they're missing out on their career. So having a paid family leave policy for men and women is so important to the greater goal of seeing more women in the workforce and in leadership. I don't want any of my employees who are helping me grow my business to feel that they can't take off. I think the biggest concern that I've heard from people is that they're afraid for any of their employees abusing the system. People aren't staying home because they're just partying. People stay home because something bad happens. It's also important time to really spend with their family when it comes to paternity or maternity leave. In a business, there are two things that matter. It's obviously the bottom line matters, and how you run your business also really matters, and that that affects the business in many mysterious ways. Every one of our coalitions has small business owners as partners. And that's because they really want this for their staff but can't afford to do it on their own. They understand the need for this policy. I am the owner operator of Bright Start Early Care and Preschool. I'm very passionate about benefits for my staff. When I heard about paid family leave, it was a no-brainer. Anything that's going to benefit them, I think not just benefits them but benefits us and benefits our clients, the parents. So I decided to be an advocate. Some point or another, we're all going to need it. Even you as an owner is going to need it. You take time away from your business, you'll still be getting paid while your business is still functional. All we need is for the government to pass it. There is another group of working people who actually need paid family leave support, the millions of Americans who provide care for their aging parents or spouses. We are in the midst of an unprecedented elder boom. Every eight seconds, another Baby Boomer turns 65 in this country. By the year 2025, one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. We're rapidly aging. And at the same time, we have less people that are available to be able to care for people, especially aging adults over the age of 80, when they need more supports and services. You want some sugar? I'm going to get sugar all the time. Yeah, I do. I had knee surgery on the 28th of March. They did a complete knee replacement. The reality is that we don't have enough health professionals to care for our aging population. So we will need to rely on family members and caregivers to resolve this growing need. Hey, Ma. It's me. Come on in. How are you doing today? All right. How are you doing, Ma? I'm all right. Good. How are you feeling? I'm feeling all right. -You took your medicine? -Yes. Donna is my daughter, and she works five days a week. She comes every day, just about. I lost my eyesight. . it'll be six years in May. I come in to check on my mom. I leave early enough to come check on her, make sure she's not in any pain and she don't need to go to the doctor. But I do have to come check on her every single morning. On the weekends, I spend the night with her. She always told us, please, whatever we do, never put her in a nursing home. And I definitely will honor that, because that's one of her fears. She don't want to be a burden on us, but she definitely don't want to go to a nursing home. Often, we think of caring for aging parents as the absolute extreme of having to put them in a nursing home or that they're at the end of their lives, when in reality, most aging adults are healthy and are thriving and want to do well but do need additional supports from time to time. They may undergo surgery, and they need some recovery support for a few weeks. They may experience an injury that will take a week or two to heal. I mean, there's lots of different ways we need to be thinking about the kinds of supports that aging adults need in America. OK, this is your vitamin B12. You take one of these a day? -Mhm. -OK. It's a struggle trying to go to work plus take care my mom. Paid leave would have helped me out a tremendous amount. I could have spent more time caring for her and taking her where she needs to go. It's very, very difficult for me as well as my family. We know that when an older adult has support from a relative or from a caregiver, they are more likely to take care of their chronic illnesses. The longer people stay at home and age in place, the healthier and the better and the longer they live. I would have ended up probably in a home some place, a nursing home or something, because I couldn't take care of myself. It's very important to stay in my own home because I have independence. It keeps me much happier, and it keeps me more that I can do some things for myself. If caregiving support is not available, seniors are likely to be placed in a nursing home or in an assisted living facility where the cost triples, if not more, to care for that person. The national average cost of a semi-private nursing home is about $82,000 a year. What family in this day and age can afford $82,000 a year? The national average cost of a home health care aid is about $42,000 a year. Close to 2/3 of our current workforce provide care for an older family member. Those numbers are just going to keep growing, given, again, how rapidly aging we are as a nation. You want me to peel the orange? You want your orange? You haven't eaten anything. -You want some orange? -Yeah, I want the orange. OK, I'm going to peel it for you, all right? All right. Fundamentally, the challenge that we're facing is that too many families are having to make options between continuing to work or to care give. And there's not a family that can afford to not work, and there's not enough caregiving options that are really affordable and accessible for most families. OK, have a seat. Wonderful, wonderful. So I love these photos of my guys. This is when they were pretty little, maybe less than two and five. And the thing I love, no matter what age they are, wherever they are, they're always hugging. -Leaf. -I think I said it first. I reached it first. [inaudible] Leaf. Cactus. Come on, you guys. One of the first things I realized about Ellen is how committed she is, how driven she is for righteousness, social justice. The first thing that drew us together was activism in the '70s. We've been together over 40 years. We're our best allies. 30 years ago, my husband and I, we moved to Milwaukee because Larry's mother died. I knew, since I type really fast, I could get a job at the phone company. The woman who hired me said, you need to know that you can't be sick for five years. I just thought, this is insane. I tried really hard to train my kids to get sick only on the weekends or at night, but I failed completely. And also, I had no paid leave when my kids were born. I thought, there's got to be a better way. I already considered myself to be an activist. I thought, this is where I want to focus my activism. I've always wondered, what would be that moment where my parents just relax and drink tea all day? But then, as long as there is these inequalities happening, my mom is going to do everything she can to change that dynamic. Hopefully victories. Three places that could win this year, DC, Connecticut, New York state. My days vary so much. It's everything from connecting people, troubleshooting, helping people share best practices. Lots of times, we're on conference calls, either with the leads in the states or state legislator. You may have seen today's New York Times. Did you see? "Family Leave Gains Traction, But Workers Still Struggle. " She's talking about how minimal what we're fighting for is. So I often talk to reporters. This isn't my mom's job. This is who she is. This is what she'll do till the day she dies. And I think she won't die because her work will have spread to many people. Hi, Tory. Mommy got a job today. Yeah, I'm excited. It's going to be a lot of work, though. Yeah. I work at a shoe store, and I pretty much just straighten the shoes up, help customers find what they're looking for. It takes about four hours to get to work and back. Even if I get up early enough to get Tory where she needs to go, and I'm ready, and I'm waiting at the bus stop, the bus does not always come on time. It varies. It could take me three hours to get to work, or sometimes it could take me an hour to get to work. It really varies on the bus schedule. Sometimes I fall asleep on the bus. And that was the worst, because I was so scared. I would wake up. I missed my stop probably three times in a row. And, yeah, I was late because of that. It's the worst feeling, because you think you're ready, and you think you're normal again, but walking on the floor and fixing the shoes and stuff, I have stretched a certain way, and it really hurt down there, really bad. I don't know if I pulled something. And my doctor was just like, nobody told you to go back to work so soon. Your body went through so much just giving birth to a whole human being. You shouldn't just go back to work. Your mind is exhausted, your body. Everything about you is just exhausted. You need that rest. One of the most difficult things for a physician is to realize that what's in the best interest of their patients are not doable. I know what's associated with the best outcomes, but I know that the patients can't do it, because they've got to decide, do I want to do what my doctor says, or do I want to be employed and have money so I can buy the food that my child is going to need? Which of these competing needs takes precedence when all of them should be met? I think 12 weeks paid leave for mothers is a floor. It takes six weeks just to get your physical being back to its normal place. Physical changes occur. The uterus shrinks back from the size of a watermelon to the size of a pear. Hypertensive problems can take many months until they go back to normal levels. My pregnancy was going along normal, fine. And then all of a sudden I was about 27 weeks along, and I started having contractions. Out comes baby Ethan, very, very premature, very early. I had four weeks off, unpaid, recovering from my c-section. And then I needed to go back to work while he was still in the hospital and in the intensive care because I didn't have enough time. I found myself sitting in a cubicle at work while my son is in the hospital really fighting for his life. And that's a decision no parent should have to make. So alert. After he was in the hospital for so long, we really didn't have a chance to bond with him. I feel like I'm getting dual messaging. Society is telling me to bond with my son and to really connect with him while also telling me I need to get back to work, and I need to be away from my family. Today is my third day back at work. I've been holding back the tears just by staying distracted and not dwelling too much. What's up, little man? With my partner working weekends and me working Monday through Friday, the three of us as a family really won't be able to do almost anything. Right after he was born, I just stared because, personally, I've never seen a baby that small. He was in the incubator. They had the blue light on him because of the jaundice. And they had tubes in his nose. And I was like, wow. More than anything, I felt like, I really have to be here. I've just got to be there. I've got to, got to, got to be there. Want to go out there? Well, I cook in a senior living community. I asked them what were the chances of me having paternity leave. And they just laughed. They think that paternity leave. . why would you want to do that? The woman stays home and takes care of the baby. And I'm like, well, I'm a dad. I want to take care of the baby. Even after Ethan was born, they worked me to death. I had no days off. I was working crazy hours. I've spent more time at work than I have with my family. I missed Ethan, and I missed Britta. And I didn't get to be around them. This society is built and geared up to just break down the family and to just split it up. I'm 29 weeks, as of yesterday, with a baby girl. Yeah, I mean, we've got diapers. One of my best friends literally sent me five boxes' worth of newborn clothes that she got from a friend. So we have all that. Do we need those? No, not right. . I just want the stuff we need when she's here. Oh, I cannot wait. I cannot wait to see you wearing a BabyBjorn. [laughing] I'm not going to help you. So you don't know how to do this, either? Also true. This is so intimidating. Are these the same? So I guess we don't have to get the same brand car seat that we do stroller. We just have to make sure it has the compatible. . Because this one doesn't look it's an infant carrier, though, right? I don't know, because of our past with losing the girls. I know I'm probably going to be a little more overprotective than I ever planned on being. We don't have to have the coming-home-outfit discussion right now. You lost the bet, so she doesn't get to come home in a cheesehead. But I have a whole receiving blanket Packer thing. We'll talk about this later. Worst retriever ever. This isn't actually retrieving. This is I throw it to him, and I walk and pick it up. Where we live, there is no law saying there has to be paternity leave. If they gave me two weeks, I'd be amazed. To get through everything we've been through, losing the twins, going through the grief, and watching my wife just be completely crushed, and now finally getting to where we are now, so excited. But it's hard to be completely excited because it's tempered by the fact that what should be one of the biggest, most important times in your life, where you don't have to think about anything else, I've got to go straight back to doing something that is not nearly as important, a job that is not changing the world. Christina is going to feel very overwhelmed when I first leave. I think she's more than capable and would be a great mom, but it's a two-person job. She's just gone through such a long period of time to get to where we are now. It'd be nice to be able to be there to take the load off her more. Will you get it? I can't get it. OK. Oh, I saw that. So I called and spoke to HR. And I said, just want to find out what our policy for paternity leave is. I'm nervous, like freaking out. So what did they say? She seemed to be confused at what I was asking about. She kept saying, well, I don't know if there's maternity leave for fathers. And I kept saying, paternity leave. She said, well, looking at this, we don't have anything for paternity. But you can take your PLB, which is Personal Leave Bank, which is the same thing that is used for vacation and for sick time. I mean, how much PLB do you even have? I was trying to look and see. We could always calculate it. You get, what, two days a week? 2. 077 hours. So you basically might have 1. 75 days left, basically. So let's hope I don't have a c-section so you could be at the hospital with me for 48 hours and then get one day off to spend time with your daughter. See, this is honestly what I expected. I was hoping I had more than just 24 hours. You really thought you were going to bring me home from the hospital, set her down, and get on a conference call? It's the most messed up thing in the world. I mean, you have a child, and you're just never going to have. . There's no bonding time with her whatsoever. You're out the door. When paid family leave exists, more men start to take that leave. And then, what we've see in California is, in many cases, then they get back to work. And guess what? These bosses are suddenly forced to realize, oh, this guy is just as good an employee now as he was before he took paternity leave. Who would've thunk? So policy actually can change culture. This is the state capital in Madison, Wisconsin. And we're here for a hearing before the senate on the Wisconsin Family Insurance Act, which would create a family medical leave insurance fund. And I'm going to testify today. These are just notes for myself for keywords to remember that say what I want to say, because I don't want to read my speech. -Wanggaard. -I, here. Marklein. -Wirch. -Here. -Larson. -Here. Senate Bill 385 expands family medical leave law and allows employees to take leave to care for a grandparent, grandchild, or sibling. -Welcome. -Hi, thank you so much. I'm Ellen Bravo. That's B as in Benefits, R, reasonable, A, Advantageous, V, Very, O, Overdue. Today, there are 18 states that are considering bills like Wisconsin's. The good news is, we have a growing body of evidence that shows that it works and that the predictions of doom never happen. So whenever we work with the women we work with, and they're thinking, oh my god, I can't get up and speak, I'll tell them, we get to tell them, what you have is misinformation and lies, and what we have are the facts and also the power of people's painful experiences that's going to change the world. I didn't know if I was going to be able to make it through this conversation without tears coming. And I'm trying to fight them back now, because my mom passed away. She suffered from many strokes before the massive heart attack took her. I'm here telling you that I wouldn't understand why I needed to choose, right? I didn't understand why I needed to be able to say, either I go to work today or miss the very last chance to be able to see my mother on this side of glory. And one thing that we all have in common in this very same room right now. . there's two sure things. One day we're going to be born, and one day we're going to leave. Some people have the luxury of the high-paying jobs where they have the security of being able to say, well, we have this nest egg saved up, so we don't have to worry. But what about those that don't? So I took a deep breath today, and I told my mother, this is for you today. I'm sitting here on behalf of anyone else that's actually facing this right now today, whether or not they need to go to work or be able to sit by their husband's bedside, their child's beside, a significant other's bedside without having the luxury of being able to say whether or not we're going to pay the bills or not. So take that into consideration when you're talking about passing this bill or not passing it, because it does affect so many lives, not just mine, but the others to follow. Thank you. That concludes the hearing. We just saw something extraordinary today. There were people here, lobbyists, to indicate their opposition to the bill, but they did not stay to speak, because what would they have said? What would they have said to Nancy Yarbrough about her mother? What would they have said to Tameka Luckovich about losing her baby? What would they have said to Rodney Crosby about being told by his employer, you didn't have that baby, so you don't get to take care of it when its sick? They couldn't have answered that. That's the consequences on workers and their families when there isn't affordable leave. This hearing was enormously impactful. And I was like, who? And then you called her and you were like, hey, Mom, it's Alexi. And Alexi was like, wait. I was like, bye. I died. I started high school at Joliet Central. Does my hair look OK? Don't lie to me. It's ugly. Well, my favorite subject was math. I want to study to be a radiologist. This is my dad and I. He had long hair. This is a family picture, which is my dad, my mom, my brother, the baby, and myself. July 4, we were outside, going to see the fireworks. My dad was not feeling good. His gums started bleeding. We took him to the hospital. They told him that he had leukemia. He was working at a company as a forklift driver. The hospital wouldn't let him leave, so he had to send a letter to his job. They told him, obviously, since you're sick, you can't work with us. So he was fired. My mom, at that time, she was working with him. And they fired her because they didn't want her to make excuses to miss a work day or something. After my dad lost his job, one of the things that became a big struggle was our apartment. And then, my sister, Mia, got sick. Eight days after Mia was settled at Lurie Children's Hospital, we moved here, to the Ronald McDonald house. The next day, after my dad was done with chemo, he went into critical condition. July 31, my dad passed away. Today is my first day of training, kind of nervous. At the moment, I'm the only one that can work because my mom has to stay and babysit my brother and my sister. My mom actually was really happy. When I actually got to the room, I was hiding the bag from the clothes and everything. She was like, you didn't get the job? And so I was pretending I didn't. She was like, it's OK. There will be other opportunities. So when she turned around, I grabbed the bag, and I showed her. And she screamed, and she was hugging me. -And she started to cry. -I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye. She was like, this is really a great opportunity for you, and there will be more, and I'm so proud of you. And that made me feel really good. I started missing a lot of days at school. I stopped going there my junior year. I was devastated. I was like, what am I going to do? I was thinking about my future. I'm only 17. I felt like everything was just going down. If my mom had her job, it would be easier. I'd be going to school, not worrying about anything. Sometimes it's hard to explain to people why paid family medical leave has such a high return on investment and is so important. And I've started to have a visual picture of why. The sticky floor. . it's one of the reasons why 2/3 of minimum wage earners are women, because too many of them get stuck on the sticky floor of not being able to earn enough seniority to increase their pay, because every time a life event happens, they start over again on the bottom rung. If you think about it this way, our workplace policies were written at a time when dad went to work, and mom stayed at home. But for most Americans, that's just not reality anymore. 8 out of 10 moms are working, and 4 out of 10 moms are primary or sole wage earners. Women without children are making an average of $0. 90 to a man's dollar. Moms are making about $0. 73 to a man's dollar. Single moms are making about $0. 56 to a man's dollar. And women of color who are moms are experiencing increased wage hits on top of that. Having sensible paid leave laws enables women not to fall behind men in terms of wages. We shouldn't leave all this talent on the sidelines. It hurts our global competitiveness to do so. In the year 2000, female labor force participation in Canada and the United States was identical. Fast forward to today, Canada is something like 7 and 1/2 percentage points ahead on female labor force participation. Why? Because they put in place increasingly progressive paid leave policies. If we had simply kept pace with Canada, over this period we'd have five and a half million more women in the workplace, five and a half million more women contributing to our innovation economy, adding literally over $500 billion to our GDP. You smell just like a baby. I love it. -What's up? -Hey, Ashley. Hey. What are you doing? I'm at work. Oh. So I have some bad news. And that is? I lost my job. What happened? I was late to work a little too much, so she let me go. I'm on WIC right now. WIC is a program that allows mothers that need help paying for formula. I would say it is like food stamps for children. This is my WIC folder, which has these checks in it. And this one right here is for the farmer's market. So you get $11 for fruits and vegetables. This one, you can get beans, peanut butter. You can get concentrated juice and two gallons of milk. Before I didn't have a job, I didn't have to get WIC, so I would be able to afford formula. But now I'm using WIC to be able to. . for Tory to eat and for myself sometimes. If someone has leave, they are going to be 40% less likely to have to go on public assistance after the birth of a new child. And that's a huge number. I spend a lot of my time as the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics advocating for the things that families and children need. And so I meet with many elected officials all the time. And what I say to them is I can take care of their family, and I can take care of their illnesses, but I need you and the government to provide them the programs, the benefits that change these children's lives. Expectant parents actually going as far as crowdfunding their maternity and paternity leave. If we want to help children, we have to help parents. And one of the important ways we can help parents is by giving them paid family leave. Maternal depression is much more prevalent than people realize. It's much more serious than people realize. 1 out of 10 women are going to have this. Low-income women are more likely to get depressed because they have less resources, less supports. We know that babies whose mothers are depressed have problems in language development, cognitive development, social-emotional development. The other issue paid family leave impacts is breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is one of the best things you can do for a child's immune system. You're more likely to breastfeed for a longer period of time, clearly, if you have more time off. That's been shown in study after study. Paid family leave helps parents in many other ways. It can also be used beyond the newborn period. Paid family leave makes it easier for parents to keep medical appointments. I've had parents say, I can't bring my kid back for his asthma because my boss says if I take one more day off, I'm going to be fired. They're more likely to bring the baby in for checkups. And therefore, since one of the major things we do at those checkups is give immunizations, it's more likely that the baby will get immunized on time. I have seen many cases where the inability for women to take off creates a much greater cost for the individual and for the health care system. So this morning, the Community Service Society of New York is hosting this health care professionals panel. The title of it is, RX, Paid Leave for New Yorkers, that they're really trying to show that we care about health, and we want a prescription for improving health, then you've got to have paid leave. New York should be the leader, the lightning rod, the model for the rest of the country. I would just invite any legislator who has doubts about the worthiness of this bill to just come spend one day in a prenatal clinic to see the stress that women face. If the governor's proposal for paid family leave passes, New York would become the fourth state in the nation to allow it. So we say, let's take the next step forward in the state of New York, which is 12 weeks of paid family leave. . [applause] to help workers lead a decent life. The reason paid leave is going to become a reality is our movement is building broad and diverse coalitions, business owners and workers, doctors, and people who care about kids, people care about seniors, people who care about equality and ending poverty. I love spending time in New York, because these business leaders help break the myth that this is an anti-business policy. Spotify wanted to figure out how could their users and their employees push for paid leave. So I've been reaching out to them to say, how about making a playlist or a series of playlists and then having the notice of that playlist include a link to organizations that will help them get involved? So what about songs? Songs. I mean, the "Cat's in the Cradle" is the ultimate. . Yes, yeah. Tupac had a song called "Part Time Mutha. " Somebody suggested that you do one for breastfeeding, and it would use all the songs that have the word "pump" in the title, "Pump Up the Volume. " I'm not from the US, so what's exactly. . sorry. I don't totally follow. What is the law? There's one law, federally. And what it says is, for companies of 50 or more, people can get up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a serious personal or family illness. That's it. I just put in, as a space-holder, Lead on Leave. What do you think? Lead on Love, it's even more beautiful. Yeah, this is the best playlist brainstorming session ever. So here's a city like New York, where so many companies are headquartered. And hearing the voices of these big businesses saying, we're expanding our paid leave, we found this is a smart thing to do, that really helps our case. So in investment banking, there's a war for talent there, just like any other industry, but even more so in that space. Companies that do better in the marketplace have diverse workforces, and they have women. They do 15% better on their bottom line, according to Forbes, if women are included in the leadership positions. Does this policy drive retention, and does it make us a more attractive place to work? I think, unquestionably, it does. One of the things I do is meet with business leaders to encourage them to see that another best practice is speaking out for public policy. And then we publicize those statements and help elected officials see that this is a pro-business policy. New policy announced today. . Microsoft, upping paid parental leave to 12 weeks. Adobe is now offering 26 weeks. When Google expanded their maternity leave, they found that they were able to reduce attrition. This is not simply the right thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. [baby crying] Happy birthday. I know, sweetheart. Bella Bear. Got her? I got her. Oh, here we go. Oh. Oh, we brought home a baby, Mom. I'll loosen it. OK, first-time parent question, babe. So you press this to loosen it. Oh, OK. -And this can come up. -OK, that's right. You're beautiful. Love you. First 24 hours home, sleepless. Everyone was exhausted. OK, OK. Shh. We'll try this. Yes, there we go. There you go. I actually started answering emails, though, about six hours after we got her home. I'm answering emails about a request for a small half box of needles for medical use. So I had to touch base with them. This company, they do a very good job of making you think that this is the most important thing, and there's nothing else, when in the end. . so I end up working three days after my daughter was born. And there's nothing we can really do. To have to leave so quickly, I missed out on the first pediatric visit. So I haven't even met her pediatrician. It's just incredibly frustrating that, during this two-week window when everything is new and changing, that Christina basically has to do it all. I'm going to try left again, but can you take her for a second? Yeah, I got her. In an ideal situation, I could literally do everything else. Christina handles the feeding, and then I could be in charge of comforting, soothing, getting her back down. I absolutely feel like I've missed out on some of the bonding. Christina has already, even her mom have already said they can tell the difference in some of her cries that I am just on the cusp of, I think, understanding. Do I feel I'm behind the curve compared to Christina? Absolutely. If DC approves a new paid leave proposal, it would be one of, if not the most, employee-friendly plans in the country. Today is the third hearing they've had. And this one is focusing on the people who live in the district and how they feel about this bill. This bill, if it was passed, would give those who live and work in DC some of the best paid family medical leave, 16 weeks in total. There's 136 people testifying today. Overwhelmingly, those are people not just in support but in need of this bill. I'm so thrilled that I could be here. I love to go when these kinds of hearings happen. Whenever I can, I like to come and root for them and show that support. I'm here to testify to city council on the importance of paid leave. I am very nervous. I don't like talking in front of people. So this is going to be a doozy. It's not every day that more than 130 DC taxpayers, residents, business owners, industry lobbyists. . I see you all here. . testify in a bill we're considering. And in my opinion, that alone demonstrates the significance of this issue. The subject of this hearing is Bill 21-415 entitled The Universal Paid Leave Act. There's several ways to look at the proposal. One of them is it's about benefits which are good for business because it makes a business an attractive place for a person to work. My name is Roger Horowitz, and I own Pleasant Pops. We're a DC small business. As a responsible employer, I'd love to be able to offer paid leave to my employees. At Pleasant Pops, we offer a living wage and paid sick leave. We provide health care, even though we aren't required to do so. And these choices have paid off. Our business has been very successful because we invest in our great employees. But there is one piece missing. We can't provide paid leave because we don't have the cash on hand to cover 16 weeks of leave. We're behind you 100%, and we'll continue to fight for this benefit as small business owners, as DC residents, and as future parents. My name is Kesha Scribner. I have been a resident of the district for over 22 years. I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer right before my daughter's second birthday. When. . I'm sorry. When I was diagnosed, my surgeon, primary doctor, and oncologist recommended that I go on disability. But how could I? While paying market rent, electric, gas, childcare, food, and other essentials, I had to work throughout the treatments treatments I have received. I worked the whole time during chemo until my body shut down on me. But life goes on, and so will I. It would mean a lot if the government that I have dedicated myself to for over 18 years supports the residents in this city by passing this Universal Paid Leave Act with a minimum of 12 weeks of paid leave, or now 16. Thank you, Ms. Scribner. Look what our campaigns do. They talk to people and get them engaged based on their own experience and the fact that change is possible. And it's just by people like them that it's going to happen, that they, in fact, are the ones who can make it happen. What they want is so small. They just want to take care of themselves and their loved ones and be independent without risking financial disaster. But they also want something big, which is to make this nation live up to its promise of valuing families. Paid family leave becoming law in DC. DC Council voted nine to four to give more than half a million DC employees up to eight weeks of leave. There are nine yeses and four nos. The motion passes. [cheering] Spirited advocates filled the council chambers for today's vote. The bill grants DC employees up to 18. . The state lawmakers are headed back to Albany tomorrow after the holiday weekend to try to finalize this year's state budget. Top of mind? Paid family leave. So this is one of those edge-of-the-seat moments, six days away from a vote on the budget. The coalition has done an amazing job. Everything should line up. They could do it. I think we have a good shot, but in New York, never quite know how things are going to shake out in the end. The one thing we do at Family Values at Work, and it's because I'm so superstitious, is we prepare an infographic ahead of time in case we win, but I make everyone knock on wood or doing an anti-evil eye sign so we don't jinx it. And then, generally, a leader in the coalition will call me or text me and say it happily passed. And then I'll send out a note to the whole staff saying, they did it. Go with the infographic. Right now, I'm on WorkingMatters. com. If our state had paid leave, nobody would have to go through what I went through. My name is Jasmine, and I live outside of Baltimore. I was recently employed for a small business. I was forced to go back to work four weeks after having my daughter and had to commute two hours to work and back. I believe our state needs paid leave to support their families and so mothers won't have to go through the hard times that I encountered. All right, we're about to make some changes, Tory. I love you. Brian's not with his job anymore. It was a combination of things. It was her. It was he hadn't really been happy there. The situation was not a good work environment. And I just decided, why am I going to stay with a company that I don't think had any interest in me? Oh, I know. I know. OK. I'd say one of the things that's one of my favorite things with her right now is putting her down on one of her play mats and watching her explore and watching her learn new sounds. Unfortunately, she didn't learn the cute babble sounds as much. She does a fantastic impersonation of a banshee. If she's not happy with something, she lets you know. Nothing's more precious than this time. It's not. And jobs will be there. And I'm hoping, and he is, too, that if he explains in an interview, you know what, I took time off to be with my family, you'd hope that whoever he's talking to or interviewing with would get that. When my dad got sick, and my sister was in the hospital, I wasn't in school. We were all worried about my education and everything. I got into Magic Johnson. So now I'm back in high school online, and I'm still getting my high school diploma. Magic Johnson Bridgescape is an alternative program. It's not at a traditional high school, which requires you to be in school all day. This allows a lot of flexibility for our students. Throughout her time that she's been with us, she has accomplished a credit so far. So it takes a special type of kid to be able to sit in front of a computer 80% of their day and to be dedicated and to want to have that accomplishment. New York approved the most comprehensive paid family leave program in the country this week. Thank you for making it a reality. God bless you. [applause] The coalition is holding this celebration tonight of their fabulous paid family leave win in New York. It made them the fourth state in the country to win family leave. And they've improved on the previous state by having a more realistic amount of time, 12 weeks. Personal experiences were a cornerstone. This is really why we do this work. Bills for paid leave have been introduced in nearly two dozen states. That's clearly paving the way for a national bill so that everybody will be covered. The momentum is going to carry all over the country. We're going to see a growing movement. It's not a question of if. It's a question of when. Paid leave has become front and center to national discourse because of everyday people like you and me. When people realize they don't have paid leave, reactions range from disbelief to despair to anger. Now that anger has been turned into action, and that's why paid leave is being considered in more than 20 states. As for me, upon returning to work after maternity leave, I felt punished for being gone. My hours were so long and grueling that for two months, I didn't see my daughter awake during the work week. For over a decade, I had helped grow the company. I was their first hire. During rough patches, I even cut my pay to help keep the place thriving. But my maternity leave experience irreparably damaged my loyalty to them. Within a year, I quit my job to go freelance and began working on this film. There are problems almost impossible to comprehend fixing within our lifetime, global terror, climate change, the growing island of garbage the size of India in the Pacific Ocean. But paid leave is something we can change now. When will all Americans have access to paid leave? The answer is not up to a single president or administration, a single corporation or lobbyist.
