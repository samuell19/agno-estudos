Okay, first word. Part one. What sound? E. E. What word? Hear. Good. Next word. What sound? E. What word? Gerard, are you with us? What word? Steal. Okay. Part two. What sound? First bell rings I hate that sound Back in the class with my head down Got a test all kinds of stress Can't take home another F Sometimes I need to stop and breathe All right. Time to ring the bell. Okay, partner up, everybody! My name is Ling Busche. I'm a seventh grade counselor at Marina Middle School. Gotta go to the end of the line. Nice try, DeShawn. We are one of the larger middle schools. We have a student population of about 900. The line is going pretty smooth today. There's a great divide in terms of student population. Guys, let's go inside! You've got the honors classes that have the highest performing students, no behavior problems. Then you have the general ed classes, which are a mix but contain students who have the lowest test scores. I virtually get no behavioral referrals for the honors classes. All of the disciplinary referrals are coming out of the general ed classes. There is a significant number of our students that don't see school as a place for them. I always say it by saying, "They don't do school." One disruptive kid can take away any learning that goes on in the classroom. So other kids wanna misbehave 'cause they think everybody's misbehaving. Ooh! Fat mama. When the class is crazy and throwing pencils, it messes up my concentration fully. So the thing I do is I just sit in my chair and do nothing. Chris, turn around. Get on task. I have sent out and suspended from my classroom more students than I have in a long time. You're gonna get me in trouble! I just the find the behavior to be completely off the wall and unacceptable, not just toward me, but toward each other. A lot of kids might not feel that school is always relevant to them. School is structured for a certain type of kid and maybe they're not that type of kid. It reaches a point where they don't feel like they're heard. Number 10 to 40, evens. This was the assignment yesterday. Dammit. They don't work. What is going on with you two? Get out a piece of paper. Science. Science. There's sort of this sense of nonstop entertainment and whatever's happening in the lesson often becomes secondary. Do not misspell the word amphibian. Anyways, I forgot what I was gonna say. Their engagement is tied to the drama that's happening in the yard, what's happening on Facebook, and they are consumed by it. And so it just continues on in the classroom. Stop kickin' me. Do you see what this freakin' whale just did? Get back in the room. Slope is M. We're going to take a Y value. Excuse me. If I continue to hear talking, one or both of you are going to find a new seat. Ugh. No, that's not "ugh." It's, "Yes, Mr. Ehnle." And then you get on task. How about opening... With that many bodies in a classroom, when somebody needs to be moved off to a corner, there are no corners 'cause there's already somebody there. I've given up. I just put them next to each other 'cause I'd rather have them talking, and yelling, and carrying on next to each other than across the room. Think about it. Lately. Think about it. We would all learn much more if nobody really was talking or getting distracted. We would all, like, have our grades up, we would all be good kids and everything. I know we're good kids, we're smart, but sometimes I guess we're too lazy to show it. What the f... you stupid... itch? That's why nobody likes your ugly ass. No one likes you! Gerardo does get angry sometimes and seek out a challenge. It has really brought him down in terms of his academic performance. I'm not the only one that fools around. Yeah, you are. No, I'm not. Shut up. You're gonna get me a... zero. If I get frustrated, I get hot. And then after, I... I get cold. All the heat goes away. I just finished up my one thing and... It's not a good feeling that I have. Middle school boys have trouble sitting still for long periods of time and focusing at their desks. This really doesn't work for them in general. But that's the way school looks, that's how it's structured. Malik, go sit over there by Jacqueline. No! I really fear for these kids who don't put forth the effort. They don't try, they don't persevere. Next word? E. Next word, what sound? How can you put together a relationship? How can you stay at a job when it's not fun if you have not learned to persevere? You're not gonna help yourself be successful when you're behaving like this. Omar? What? This is not the way to help yourself... I do like learning new stuff, but if they're teaching it in a difficult way that I don't understand, then I'm just gonna stop tryin'. You know what? I don't want to hear the arguing. But I know I could do better. If I just turned in my homework. Tonight's homework for science is 12-3. Jacqueline, go sit in the back. Mr. Ehnle does disrespect me. He has an island on his head. He has huge glasses. And he screams a lot. Jacqueline, if you are having conversations, it will end or you will be out of the classroom. Why do you always send me out of the classroom? Huh? Because you do so much talking. When the teachers have tried things in a classroom then the student comes down with the referral... When we get kicked out, we go down to the office. I'm always the one that he sends out and it always feels bad. Sometimes they get pigeon-holed because of, you know, previous patterns of behavior. I think that they all feel like the underdogs, no one's rooting for them. Gerardo, when you get sent down, nine times out of ten it's because of something like... which seems small like an argument. She's like, "You have a history of doing stuff." And I said, "But I'm not doing what I used to back... back... back in sixth grade." And I think... A lot of the students that come in and out of the office, ironically, sometimes it feels like they want to come to the counseling office, which is a little bit of a dilemma because they're outside of the classroom more. And it's hecka not fair. If it all boils down to it, you're messing yourself up because... But it's because if I'm not doing nothing, how am I messing myself up? How am I... how am I... how am I the one that's putting myself into this when I'm not doing nothing? You're missing your test, so now it's gonna be kind of a hassle to get you to make up that test. It all adds up. Okay, well she can be part of that, too. I swear, like... We have a consultant that came in recently. And she actually described our school as "apartheid land," which I was, at first, a little bit offended by, but, um, after thinking about it, I understood what she meant because she saw who was coming in and out of the counseling office. I don't want to see you in here with another referral today, Gerardo. All right. Get it together. It's our Latino and African American kids who are underachieving, who don't feel like they're a part of the school, and we have to address that. We have to make those kids part of the school and we have to allow those students the opportunities and, in fact, get them to achieve at a higher level. Moises. Yes? Why are you out of class, buddy? I'm going to the... We are suspending at a rate higher than any other middle school in this city. And I know that that has to stop. Something that would benefit all of the kids had to happen across all of the students. So when one of our therapists talked about the idea of going into the classroom to teach meditative strategies which would reduce conflict, um, increase focus, you know, we were like, "That's perfect." What we'd like to do is create a sense of this is a community and we're not just gonna push you out. We're gonna help teach you about how to do this and do it well. So we're gonna look and see where you're at in the process, how many times this has happened with you... This only happened once. She says there was a sixth grade incident also. One of the reasons that we embraced bringing in mindfulness into the classroom was to see if we could create a bright light within the community where adults and children can see that, "Hey, something is really working to make this community more inclusive and for everybody," if we can start creating those spots around Marina Middle School, then others will see it and start to adopt that empathetic and that attitude of saying that the school is gonna meet more of those needs. My name is Megan Cowan. And I am here from an organization called Mindful Schools. We go into classrooms and teach something called mindfulness. I'm gonna be visiting your classroom twice a week for just 20... maybe 30 minutes. There are gonna be periods of time that are totally silent. So, what? Are we gonna be meditating? So, let's raise your hand if you wanna have a question. The biggest misconception is that mindfulness is spiritual or religious. Although it can be traced back to, um, very traditional practices, uh, it can be used in a secular way to address issues in society today. What we're gonna try right now is just what I call a mindful posture. Just lift off your chair momentarily for a few... we're gonna do this for about two minutes maybe. And then notice if anything in your body is moving, like if your leg is bouncing, or your foot's moving, or your fingers are moving. I think of mindfulness as a tool or a skill. Society and our culture is training us to not be focused. So technology is causing us to jump from one thing to the next constantly, all the time. And when we're asked or required to focus on something, our brain actually is not prepared to do that. It's not trained to do that. So I think on a very practical level, it's just creating more focus in our lives. And try to let everything become still. Ugh. And notice that this is uncomfortable. It's not... uncomfortable. And if you feel the need to talk. It really teaches about increasing impulse control so that we get more choice around our actions. Okay, now relax. Keep your attention with me. Yeah, tell me... tell me why you didn't like it. It was like, it was all right. Then later I couldn't feel my body and it felt kinda weird on my legs, so... like if I got shot or something. I don't know. You know what, you guys? We're gonna have to figure out some way to make this work since I'm gonna be here fifteen times. Fifteen times? Yeah. Mindfulness actually is training you to be comfortable when you're not being entertained. 'Cause you will not be entertained 24 hours a day of your whole life. Hang on. When Megan came in, I thought, "Aw, man, we're that bad they gotta bring a TV show about us?" I'm not sure how our class was chosen, but, uh... The kids ask why mindfulness was brought to their classrooms. It's hard to go down that road when they're so used to going down the other road, which is a road of chaos and disorder. If they cooperate and they, like, pay attention, they would change, but since I know some of the kids won't, I don't know about the class. Agh! Not all of my family members got to finish middle school and high school. And I wanna show them that I can do what they could have done. And I wanna prove to them that I can go to college and show them that I'm getting a good career and changing my life. When the sound of the bell is completely gone for you, raise your hand. We were just trying not to be our normal selves in class when she came in. We're usually loud and we yell across the room and we just get up from our seats and, like, crack jokes and stuff. But, like, it was kind of hard. Can you turn this way? So, put your hand on your belly and everybody take one deep breath that only you can hear. And then take three breaths, noticing if you feel it in your chest. When Megan first came to teach the first mindfulness class, I was like, "Get out of here. I don't wanna do this." It was fun throwing pencils and stuff, you know? Not listening to teachers is always fun, but it's not the thing to do. Up. Get in the chair. No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't ask if you wanted to. Yes, you did. So I know there's some distraction, but we're just gonna continue. Hey, guys, what's your name again? Rusty Shackleford. So, Matt, Rusty Shackleford? Can you... can you help me out by just having your attention up here? All right. Okay. It's not like it's hard to reach them, it's just that they want to act like they don't really care about nothing. But I know that they do care. They're trying to act like they're tough. They try to act like, "Oh, I'm better than this," you know? When they're really not Raise your hand if something about a minute of mindful breathing was unpleasant. I'm not used to being so quiet. I've lived in San Francisco for a long time, so you always hear like cars and stuff and it wasn't noisy, so... Okay. So you're used to the noise in San Francisco. So we're gonna end right now with the bell. You just really want to find a way to reach them and you're not. And so I don't know... I don't know where to go next with it. There goes Malik. Go there along the alley. Don't go around the corner. Where's Steven at? Steven Hopkins goes to After School with me. That's how we stay out of trouble. In the beginning, I had, like, all A's. And, like, during the middle, I just started, like, not wanting to do my work and stuff. I would just go... go to school and not even do anything. Just not do my work, go have fun. Installing is kinda fast though. Is it? Yeah. When he comes home, I always ask him, "Are you okay? How was school? What did you did? Did anything change? Anything wrong?" So I try to get at least an idea of what happens during the day for him. If I just put him on the side and never talk to him or don't care about what he does, then that's different. Yeah. There it goes. For the past, I would say, maybe a year, year and a half, we're having really hard issues with him. Uh, tardiness, attendance, the friends that he hangs with, and the things that he does. It's like if you're doing good they give you plusses. If you're fooling around or not in your seat or something, they give you circles. How many plusses did you got today? All together in the group? Eight. In your group? Table 10? Eight good? Yeah. How many bad? Seven. Are we doing equal here or are we doing minus or plus? Come on. One time they called me at work and says, "You have to come pick up Gerardo right now. We cannot keep him in school no more." And I'm like, "It's 11 in the morning." He says, "Well, you need to come pick him up." I mean, they just wanted you to leave the premises and don't come back. I mean, that is pretty bad. But I was doing good though. I understand, but for how long? I graduated from Marina Middle School. I was exactly like Gerardo. I was actually honor roll for about six months and then everything went down sour, too. I started hanging with the wrong crowd, I was answering back, not doing homework until eventually I got kicked out of school. Sometimes I fool around in class. Oh, that I know. You don't have to tell me. Why did you sit in the front? 'Cause you're special? Because I love my teacher. No, you don't. All right. No, it's not all right. Don't just tell me "all right" just to tell me to be quiet. I'm trying to make a point here. It would not be fair for me to go to work on time and have everybody else be late when I'm on time every time. There's little things out there that I regret I done and I was... believe me, if I could go back, I would have changed it. That's the thing that I'm trying to teach him. I says, "Look at my mirror. Look where I am. Look what I've gone through." I've been doing dishes, I've been doing janitor work. I've been doing all kinds of jobs. I've been selling fruits in the streets. So, to me they're nothing new, but for him, he has a chance and the opportunity to be somebody here. And he just doesn't take advantage of it. I think it's a waste of time. I don't think the school... but he needs to come up with better choices though. Right? Yeah. Sounds like we're in Hong Kong. Can I have your attention? So the way things went on Monday, it's not gonna work for mindfulness. So I need to find out who really does not wanna be here for mindfulness. I'm gonna need each of you that are raising your hand that you don't want to be here to tell me why. It's boring? It's boring and it's stupid. Do you ever find other things in your life boring or stupid? No. No? Never? So this is the only thing. So you definitely want to go. Yeah. Okay. There are a few kids who make the rest of the class particularly challenging. If there were five of them that weren't in there, then the majority of them actually would be trying and would be participating. Diego, come here. Okay, they're just gonna head outside with you guys and we're gonna have the class without you. Thank you. It's our philosophy as a program that all students are present in the class even if they are the disruptive ones because we believe that they're the ones that might even gain the most benefit. But right now what I'm seeing is there's a handful of kids that are causing so much disruption that it's at the expense of the other 30 kids in the class. Fat boy. Some of the people that are ready and willing to do it are not gonna feel comfortable unless the rest of the class is settled in. So raise your hand when the sound of the bell is gone. Oh, we're supposed to be going to lunch. It's like hitting a brick wall. I just am frustrated and kind of hopeless The defiance is so deliberate and I don't know if I can work with that in this large of a group. So I sat down with Mr. Braxton and Ms. Busche to ask how I should respond to this class. The problem that I'm meeting with these kids in particular is that four kids are being deliberately destructive at the expense of thirty other students. Now, we're a public school. We take everybody where they're at and we do the best job we can with them. And the idea that thirty kids are waiting for five kids... Yeah. Or that somehow these kids are the victims or they're not getting something at the expense of others, that's a paradigm I prefer not to set up that some get and some don't and that we sacrifice five so that others do. We should give the same thing to everybody. It may not come in the same way, though, and I'm okay with that. Let's take this one day at a time. And today we'll take those four out for the class... And then reintegrating them when that class comes back together as a whole, it's not formed for kids in the class. I had a parent teacher conference and it was bad 'cause the teachers were talking bad about me. Not a lick of work. Nothing turned on. By not doing homework, she thinks that's the way she can get back at the teacher. This is what we did in math class today. She got behind math and reading and writing also because the teacher sent her to the, uh, office. Every day, she should be able to bring a paper home... In America, it's like boring for them. Getting a diploma is like, "Whatever." What is that going to get? Always do this on the overhead projector. The principal said that if she gets, like, one more thing, she'll have to change the school. But I don't want her to get out of Marina. I like the school. She could do very well if she focused and really decided, "I'm gonna be a great student." Yeah. I think it's really up to you. I think you have the resources and it just takes a decision on your part to do your part. I hope to pass. I would feel kind of sad. If I don't pass, then I don't get to go on with my friends and move on. Thank you. You're welcome. When I wake up in the morning and it's the day that we're teaching at this school, I have a mixture of mild dread and also some determination of what can I do today? So I wanna get creative and figure out how to reach 'em. I'm gonna have you guys start leading mindfulness. Please let your eyes close. Okay, thank you. All right, you guys, what do you think is your biggest influence in your life? Lesly? Dad. Dad. Jacqueline? My sister. Okay, so we've got dad, sister. Gerardo? Art. Art. Would you be surprised if I told you the biggest influence in your life is your mind? And when we practice mindfulness you're strengthening your mind to have the influence on your life that you want it to have. And when we practice mindful breathing, we're developing the strength of our mind to have influence on us. It was hard to sit still and to, like, not move my hands or anything. It was just, like, "Okay, I just need to calm down and, like, help myself to stop moving to see if this works or not." One way that we can create influence in our life with our mind is by having thoughts on purpose rather than thoughts on accident. So go ahead and get back into a mindful position. I'm gonna say a phrase. So the first thing I want you to repeat silently in your mind is, "I wish for myself to be happy." And then try the wish, "I wish for myself to be healthy." And now create a wish in your mind that is specific to yourself, whether it's something you want to accomplish, a quality that you want to have, something you want to do. "I wish for myself," you fill in the blank. It just helps you, like, relax and forget about everything else. Is anybody willing to say what they wish for themselves? Thank you. Gerardo? To do better in school. Great. In his class. Thank you. You wish to do better in school, particularly Mr. Ehnle's class. Yeah. I want to move to Alaska. You wish to move to Alaska. Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. Raise your hand if this was the first time that you had thoughts on purpose about your happiness. Okay, I want you three times today wish yourself happiness, okay? But your challenge is to remember to do it. And I want to express my deep appreciation for your participation today. That room really shifted today and I felt like the students really participated in a way that was helpful to them as each individual, but also as a classroom. Okay, thanks. Thank you, Mr. Ehnle. I have thoughts about the Mindfulness Program. I'm perfectly willing to participate and I hope it helps students in learning and effectively using the opportunity that is their middle school experience. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Good morning again. Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. We're gonna go into mindful listening. I encourage you to have an open mind this morning while we try something that you probably haven't done before. Keeping your attention on sound. Listen to the sounds outside the room. And then focus on the sounds inside of you. At first, we all thought she was like a voodoo person 'cause of what she was wearin'. You guys got really mindful. Can you identify how you felt listening to the sounds outside? I was a little impatient. A little impatient. Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause I'm used to moving and chatting a lot. You're used to moving and chatting. Exactly. So try to be mindful of sounds. Outside, inside, inside yourself. And I will see you on Monday. Thank you again, you guys, that was great. Mindfulness Program... it's all right. It's okay. I think it'll only help certain kids that really is interested in it. Omar, he was really getting in a lot of trouble in school. He has straight F's. Had a very bad discipline problem. Would not do what the teacher says and just a problem kid. Hey, how you doin'? Oh... How was your day? Good. Good? How's your asthma? All right. It's okay? Me and my husband, we thought it would be best for him to stay with us, as I had just retired. There's some cookies. Did you get a progress report? Yeah. He brings home a progress report. That's one of the things he's required to bring home to me every day. And that's been every day since he's been going to Marina. But what about Ms. Ellis? There's nothing for Ms. Ellis. Every day I've been asking you... Omar can be quite challenging when he's defiant. Quite challenging. I need to know what she says. I know what you tell me. She has expectations for me. She just wants me to do good in school. I need you to put down what she says about you. She's pushing me to do well. Sometimes I don't really listen to her. I just didn't do it this morning. I think you need to start... I don't really care. I have nothing to say to her. I just want to see some improvement from you. You know. Today I brought you something. What I brought is something that we can eat. Raisins. Okay. Okay, so somebody tell me your three reactions. Yeah? My first reaction, I was excited. Second one, I was like, "Okay." The excitement kind of went away. You said raisins, I don't eat raisins. I'm gonna hand them out. So just hold it right now. Don't eat 'em yet. So what I'd like you to do is open your mouth... shh, we're gonna do this quietly... and take a whole minute to chew it. And what I want you to pay attention to is how your raisin changes. It's so sour. We want to bring mindfulness into our entire experience, not just sitting still with our eyes closed. The next time you're eating something that you like, I want you to be mindful of it so that you can experience it differently than you have in the past. Okay? Thank you, you guys. Have a great rest of your week. I'll see you next week. When I have problems at school, I really don't talk to my parents. Not really my mom. I don't really feel like she can understand me. I love my parents. I'm happy to have both of them. I am the only sister, the only daughter. I feel lonely with the two little brothers that I have. Sometimes I get mad at them. Stop throwing it over there. The way I deal with getting mad is that I would just, like, pretend nothing happens and keep it in me, never let anybody know. The same thing at school. If someone makes me cry and no one else knew about it, I would keep it in myself and pretend nothing happened. I really have no way to let it out. It's always, like, loud everywhere I go. It's never quiet, never still. When we meditate, it's always quiet and I get to listen to different sounds and... it's really different for me. Raise your hand if you have somebody in your life who you have difficulty with but it's somebody that you care about a lot or you love. And bring to mind this person who you care about but maybe there's some challenge with. Repeat silently. "I wish for you to be happy." "I wish for you to be happy." Ever since my parents broke up, I really didn't care if I was angry or not. My teachers and everything, like, I really didn't care if they were frustrated with me or anything. "I wish for you to be safe." "I wish for you to be safe." Gerardo has a lot of anger towards me sometimes. We get along good, we have fun together, we spend time together. And sometimes we just don't get along. I think it's because I'm not living with his dad and it's hard for him to understand that we're not together anymore. Find a wish on your own that's meaningful regarding this person and you make the wish, you choose the wish. My mom, she yells at me. The whole place just feels all... like a pot of water that's cooking. Sometimes you can run away from it and sometimes you really can't. Sometimes you just gotta, like, be there and you gotta burn in the little pot thing. Let your attention rest in your body, just noticing how your body feels and how your mind feels. I want Gerardo to graduate, have a degree. I know that he can do it, but right now it's tough time. It's really hard for him to focus in school. But I want him to be somebody in life. If I could rule the world everyone would have a gun In the ghetto of course when giddyuppin' on their horse I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased But no don't weep This morning, I used mindfulness 'cause my mom, she was yelling at me 'cause I didn't get up in the morning and I was just mad. I was just gonna, like, lock the door and, like, go back to sleep and not go to school today. But then, like, I just... I chilled for a little bit, I used mindfulness real quick. And it made me feel more calm. You can't hide And I came to school. And take it slowly Ready or not here I come You can't hide Good morning. While you're doing mindful breathing, I'm gonna deliberately make a little bit of noise. And using the anchor words breathing in and breathing out will help you stay focused on your breathing, even when there's some distraction or chaos. Breathing in. Breathing out. I wasn't surprised in the beginning. When things got quiet, people would, like, make fart noises and stuff. But now when she rings the bell, we could be, like, yelling and stuff and fighting, but we still know when that bell rings, that we stop. Go by the court, Alex. I haven't talked about mindfulness with my friends, I talked about it with my family. I have one brother. I woulda had another brother, but he died. I learned how to play basketball from him. My brother was 22. So Doody said he's gonna come? No, he wanted us to come and get him. Is he gonna come... After his brother died, he changed in school. His grades went down. His behavior was kind of nonchalant, like he didn't really care about too much of anything. And when he got a little older that's when you start trying to get in trouble and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. This is my brother. He died five years ago. And I was asking a lot of people if they knew who did it. Did you? Yeah. Some people say yes, some people say no. Not like I could do something about it though. Yeah. After he died, then a couple of other people that you knew and loved died, too. And so it was... you started really acting out. This is my other friend Gene. This is the one that got shot in the back of the neck. And ran all the way to his granny's house and died on her floor. That was in the beginning of the school year. Do you miss him? Yeah. I do, too. Yeah. Yeah. We used to play over there when we were little. What was over there? Just open field. Kickball... Was it bigger? And the tree was so shady. Did he get killed like right there at the gate? Yeah. And somebody had came up and shot him. Too much death and you get too depressed. It's almost like a war zone sometimes out here. Didn't there used to be hecka balloons over there? Yeah. Balloons, teddy bears. Then what happened? They put this gate up because at first the gate wasn't there. I'm trying to focus on school and sports. That's basically it. What happened to the balloons, like? And hopefully if I keep on playing sports, that could probably get me out of here. I could take my family out of Richmond. We could just move somewhere. Yeah, they grew up right here just like I grew up on the block. They all did. Yeah. All right. Can I get somebody to lead today? Do you want to, Omar? Get in a mindful posture. Ebony. Get up. Oh, you have to be kind though. Say it in a nice way. Ebony, can you please sit up. Thank you. Thank you. That's better. Now look down and listen to the bell. Keep your eyes closed. How do you feel right now? Relaxed. Relaxed? Yeah, it's all right. It's cool. All right. Nicely done. Thank you very much. Let's see. Jennifer, do you wanna lead? All right. And go ahead, ring it. Shut your ass, groupie! Move over! When I get angry at other kids at school, I'm really good at putting them at their spot. Dirty old goat. Oh, she didn't hear. I've seen the sweet side of Jacqueline. And I sometimes would like her to show it, but I guess she doesn't really want anyone to see it. So if I was gonna write down words for the Jackie that other people see, what words would I come up with? Nice. Mm-hmm. Funny. Mm-hmm. They look at me like I'm mean. Sometimes they see you as mean? Yes. What's the Jackie on the inside? Shy. Mm-hmm. I don't think doing mindfulness changes me at all. Do you think anybody knows you're shy? No. How about thoughtful? No. It's boring, but, like, I could use it as a tool if I'm mad or something. When people see you as mean, what's that all about? 'Cause I pushed 'em around and, like, I hit them and stuff like that. Mm-hmm. So you kinda act tough. Is that who you are? That is a little bit of who you are on the inside? Okay. So sometimes... She does use mindfulness. I don't know why she doesn't say it, but she does. She would have, like, problems and, like, I would help her out, but sometimes she would just use mindfulness to help herself. Your battery is f... low. Outlet. We need an outlet. But, yeah, me and her had... Good morning. Can you raise your hand if you're willing to say when you used mindfulness since I saw you on Wednesday? Jacqueline? Thursday. 'Cause there was a problem. And what kind of mindfulness did you use? Breathing. And why did you decide to use breathing? 'Cause she told me to calm down. So Lesly was with you and she told you to calm down? Mm-hmm. Did it work, or help, or change anything? Mm-hmm. Will you say anything more about it? There's nothing else to say. Okay. We are taken I like to draw, like, if I wanted to draw something about San Francisco, I, like, draw the buildings and stuff. I like graffiti arts too. We are take... taken We are... we are... we... we... we are taken With doing graffiti, I can see that the anger goes away and he will ask for time alone to do that. We are taken If I practice, I could be a painter like people here. I can have as much talent as anybody, but I just need to keep at it. I don't really need to use mindfulness when I draw, but, like, it gives me a little boost to try to help me concentrate, try to see what I want to draw. Yeah. When I grow up, if I could paint or draw as a side job, yeah, that would be cool. And like if I could do it, like, as a solid, solid job, then, yeah, I would definitely do that. It's just nice. I think it's true that I'm in danger of failing seventh grade. It doesn't mean that I'm gonna just, like, quit. It means that, like, I'm gonna try harder to pass. Uh, Mr. Ehnle, I wanted to know if you as a class have ever done mindfulness without me. Yes! No. We have. Shh. Okay. I wondered if you had a bell... The classes that best sustain mindfulness, the teachers and the students continue to use the bell even when the program is finished. Mindfulness is worth the class time. No doubt about that. It makes them feel like they have more control over themselves and their behavior, and that they aren't simply victims of external circumstances. The volume of a circle. Pi times radius squared. The role of the teacher has expanded. The biggest challenge that we have is changing our systems and structures within these school buildings so the kids can fit in. If you go and you look at database indicators that help students learn, self-reflective behavior is way up on that list. And that's one of the things that many of our good learners bring that others don't bring to the school. And so a program like this that helps teach kids that, and helps it become a part of the practice within the school, and reinforces that is going to help them. Okay. So today is our last day of mindfulness. Matt. So, if you have a reaction or something to say, I want you to just notice it in yourself. If you cannot control your impulse, you have to ask yourself, "Who's in control?" Mindfulness doesn't make problems go away. It's a wrong assumption to think that if you practice for a long time you'll never be angry again, or you'll never have another problem, or no one will ever be mad at you. That's not the point at all and you can never create that situation. It's that the way you're meeting your experience changes to allow more lightness and more happiness. I did bring something for you today. Matt, do you want to say something? Yes. Okay. Is it raisins? No. Is it Raisin Bran? No. They're called pocket hearts. Whenever you see it, or feel it, or remember it, I want it to be something that reminds you that you have a tool now that you can use for the rest of your life. Seeing how my dad works, like, it's stressful. I think I would want to use it if I was stressed. It's like something in your backpack, you know? It's always there. You can just pull it out and use it. Once you have your heart, I want you to think about how school would be different if everyone practiced mindfulness. Yeah? No bullying. No bullying. Yeah. Why do you think that would make no bullying happen? Yeah. And I get the stress in one minute, people teasing me and bothering me about everything. That I just like going to a private place, saying all my thoughts inside of me what I feel. Nobody is there to look and see anything I do. It would make a difference if the whole world used mindfulness. A lot of people wouldn't be killed. There would be less shooting. All right, everybody. I wish you a happy summer. And if I don't see you next year, a happy eighth grade. Take care. Thank you. Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathin' And I pray don't take me soon 'Cause I am here for a reason Sometimes in my tears I drown But I never let it get me down So when negativity surrounds I know some day it will all turn around Because all my life I've been waiting for I've been praying for for the people to say That we don't wanna fight no more They'll be no more wars And our children will play One day One day One day One day One day One day It's not about win or lose Because we all lose when they feed on the souls of the innocent Blood drenched pavement Keep on moving though the waters stay raging In this maze you can lose your way Your way It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way No way Sometimes in my tears I drown I drown But I never let it get me down Get me down So when negativity surrounds Surrounds I know some day it'll all turn around Because all my life I've been waiting for I've been praying for for the people to say That we don't wanna fight no more They'll be no more war And our children will play One day One day One day One day One day One day One day this all will change Treat people the same Stop with the violence Down with the hate One day we'll all be free And proud to be Under the same sun singing songs of freedom like One day One day One day One day All my life I've been waiting for I've been praying for for the people to say That we don't wanna fight no more There'll be no more wars And our children will play
