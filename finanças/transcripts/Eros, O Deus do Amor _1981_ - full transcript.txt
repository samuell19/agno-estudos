"Would you agree that sex is where philosophy begins?" Sao Paulo. Brazil. South America. Southern hemisphere. Earth. Solar system. Universe. One of them. I was born here. I live here most of my time. More and more. But I still don't understand what kind of place this is. Sometimes I wonder what continent this is. I think it's neither. What this agglomerate means? The other day I felt it was like a mushroom. An endless explosion. A huge placenta. Almost nobody likes it. The rest of the country doesn't like it. The tourists too. And its inhabitants seem to dislike it sometimes. Anguish here seems to be more evident. Everything seems more evident, inaccurate and incomprehensible. For me, many things happened here and to me here. In almost all places, something happened. For this and other reasons something holds me here. Confines me, immobilizes me and fascinates me. This is my place. My place to hunt, to suffer, to love and to feel pleasure. All the references and memories. Euphoria, depression, struggle, victory Delusion, impetuosity and coldness. Everything. People say it is a mischaracterized city. It's not hot nor cold. It's not civilized nor primitive. It doesn't belong to anything. It's sad, it has no charm and no logic. It isn't old or modern. It's just strong, as people say. But it's aggressive too. But mainly, and I think it's true... ...this city is indifferent, distant and inaccurate. Has almost no tradition. It's selfish and individualist. Cruel and greedy. And because of these things this city holds me. Like an osmosis. An amalgam. An identity, a person. This city it's like me. The same whirl and avalanche. The eagerness and the fury. The lack of measurement. The unknown will. My interest is focused on myself and my obsessions. That were many but now is practically only one. There's only an obsession left. Sometimes it seems the beginning and sometimes, the end. This morning, one day after my 48th birthday... ...I woke up in this house. I live here with my wife Eleonora, my daughter Berenice... ...and some servants. Eleonora continued to sleep. She'll wake up late again and she'll be upset. Yesterday she waited for me to celebrate my birthday... ...and to drink champagne. She waited until I arrive. No party, no champagne. Just fight. I arrived at 4 am. We fight again and we didn't come to any solution. She takes good care of the house, the dogs and the plants. This is all she does. Besides worrying about our daughter. But she's a good daughter. Do you need two, sir? No. Just one, Eugenio. You should already know that. - Cut a larger piece today. - Of course. My grandfather started the company. He only spoke Italian. My father turned it into something huge and independent. But I still need to have control. I already work too much here. Willingly and eagerly. But I lost interest in the expansion. In the growth. I come here to control, to decide and to take the money. I don't stay for too long. Just some minutes. But I don't lost control. Excuse me, Mr. Marcelo. - Will you sign the check now? - Just a minute. Cancel my appointments and tell Mr. Mario I can't meet him today. My father built this building and gave me the top floor. Up here. A gift of accomplice. It's my place. Just like he had his. Kind of an isolated place in the world. Just for me. But deep inside there was a fight with my mother to control me. She died soon after that. The building was sold, but I kept my place. I've had others after that. Sometimes to keep things easy, I had several simultaneously. But I always kept this place. And I never will. It had several names. Some were pejorative. It has undergone several renovations and decorations. Went through periods of splendor and decadence. Of life and death. But it's always waiting for me. It's like I'm chained to it. Today, once again, I got earlier here. With expectation and excitement. Because of Ana. Ana, she arrived unexpectedly and took care of everything. I never felt anything like it. And I feel that is something that will continue. Listen to this, Marcelo. It's just like us: "A mix of relative and absolute morality within the individual." "In Gestalt, we use the term 'double standard'..." "...which means that we have two ways to measure morality..." "...one for us and one for others." "Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi." This means: "What is legitimate for Jupiter, is not legitimate for oxen." You highlighted the entire book! And you're reading just these parts. - How do you know that? - I guessed. I want you to read the whole book. And highlight the things you like. Of course. But I wanted to read the things you highlighted... ...'cause I thought it would help me to know you better. You talk too much about it. Why is that? Women are always concerned about these things. This will never happen. But people don't stop trying. I am not able to even understand myself. Maybe if I understand you, it can help me. Everything is so absurd and weird. I don't know what I'm doing here. I shouldn't be here, but here I am. I don't know what you did to my head. With my head, my plexus... Whatever. But it's something I still think it shouldn't have happened. Good morning. - Hi Ana! - Hi! Will you be late? I'll be here for another hour. - Do you have a cigarette? - Yes, I have. Everything happened so fast, so... I never thought something like this could happen to me. You might not believe it, but... ...Alberto was... ...is the second boyfriend I've ever had. I still can't understand, see or explain it all. I never think about it. I think I never want to. You called me and we went there. In the middle of the day. I never did something like that. All those things that happened there... You're right. It's beautiful! It's warm. Come here, Marcelo. Come. - I'm afraid. - Give me your hand. Happiness and unhappiness are only one thing: The image of my mother. She came here to remember something sad or happy. Was something intense anyway. She always took me along. For me, it was a place that made ??me very happy like no other place. Made ??me want to exist and not exist as well. To live forever and to never live. It still warm. The rock. Sit down here. Let's stay here. In silence. Look far away. Listen. The wind. Don't think about anything. Anything. Look up, now. Look far away. Ten minutes more and we'll go back. Alright. A RAIN OF RUIN WILL FALL ON JAPAN THE ATOMIC BOMB IS DEVASTATING JAPAN I'm freezing! Pick up your things. We have to be home when your mom call from Sao Paulo. It seems that she won't come before saturday. Attention! The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ...killed more than 100 000 people. It's the same number of people injured. What are you doing here? Get out! Little rascal! What was you thinking? With this baby face! Your mother pays me to teach you english and french. Not to... Not to... Some people told me a lot about you, yesterday. Don't you want to know what they told me? They warned you, didn't them? Sort of. What they told you? So? You can say it. I don't care. "He'll never change." "He was born this way." Did you born this way? Want some? Come here. - What's your name? - Ligia. - You're the son, aren't you? - Yes. What's that in your face? I was kicked by horse. That one over there. Are you not afraid to stay here? What did you do to him? Because of that I have doubts sometimes. Do you really like my company? The other day I thought that we really need each other. I looked at you and I thought you needed me and I needed you. But suddenly everything is different... You're weird sometimes. - Why do you have this camera? - Is not what you're thinking. - So tell me why. - It's a present. - From a woman? - Maybe. Who? My wife. I want you to film me. I... I like you a lot. So I want to record this moment. After all we never know what can happen. - Is this a threat? - No. Like you say, it's a observation. This can be something or not. Now this is something so make a video. Maybe we can start talking about your favorite subject. About yourself. But tell me, who was your first? The real first one? Real? How's that? Well, my first time was with my english teacher. But in my mind was a beautiful woman... ...I saw near our farm, at the train station. It was 1935. Wow, 1935! - Your mother was born in 35. - My mother was born in 38. This train station woman was beautiful, kind, everything! I saw her one more time. At another place near our farm. It was an old mill. It was abandoned. A strange place. It looked like a castle. A pagan temple. An ancient and mysterious ruin. I spent hours walking around there. I was always alone. That place fascinated and scared me. It excited my imagination. One day, it was raining heavily. So I waited all day inside there. And then she appeared again. She was carrying the same weapon. She was different. She seemed sweet and distant. Her gaze was intense and vague at the same time. That face made ??me very happy. It's hard to explain It stuck with me until today. I always think about it. Whatever. I want you to tell me... ...who you loved? - Loved? - Yes, loved. Did you loved someone? I guess so. I know I always say "I guess", but I really don't know exactly. Were many years, but it seems everything happened so fast. The only thing that remained... ...was a sense of expectation. A promise that never happened. At least until you came along. There was always an anti climax. A kind of empty. Some of the women who I met were really wonderful. And I think it was never their fault. They deserve to be loved. Sometimes it seems it was all a dream. And I can't recognize anyone. In short, they were many and I didn't love any of them. I'm afraid, Marcelo. I like you but I'm afraid. Afraid of what? This is a natural thing. No. No! - No! - C'mon. - And if I get pregnant? - So what? My father... - My mother... - I'll be careful. It will be a tragedy. No, it won't. No! Did I tell you my daughter's name is Berenice, just like yours? Yes. You did. How old is she? Two and a half. She's amazing and beautiful. We are very connected. I always wonder how she'll be when she grows up. What happened to her? It happened what she was afraid would happen. The same problems as always, but there wasn't a tragedy. She disappeared for a long time. But she came back. EARTH ACCLAIMS THE CONQUERORS OF THE MOON It can't be! It's the end! These guys spend a fortune to launch a man to the moon... ...while people starve here. It's immoral! Have you ever wondered how much food that money could buy? Of course you don't think about it. Of course. You know. What's the benefit of going there before solving the problems here? What's the benefit for me? Stop being stupid! I'm serious! You're the most horrible person I have ever met! I've known you for seven years and you're getting worse! Take it. For me... ...only this picture is worth the price of the trip. We can see where we live. We're suspended in an abyss. In a vacuum. We live in an abyss. - You would love to be alone here. - Why not? The entire planet just for you. It's not a bad idea. Sometimes people annoy me. Even when they're not around. I like to be alone when I want. You're always be alone. You're reading a lot about politics. You're a disgusting right winger! You should be in jail! You should be in jail! You're the most disgusting person I've ever met. The most selfish! The most everything! Don't think it will last. You'll regret it. When the world changes, I'll be the first to get you. I'll make you disappear! You are a social disease! I'll have you arrested! "Marcelo, I could be talking directly to you." "I saw you in bed, in the same place as always." "And I saw myself as I'm now." "And all that's happening now and will happen late." "Our game of attraction and repulsion has gone too far." "We're addicted to it." "You were everything for me:" "A father, a hangman, a master, a lover, a tormentor..." "And sometimes a slaver too." "We're trapped in a prison of pleasure and anxiety." "Somehow you touched an obscure and essential part of me." "It made me stay by your side." "It trapped us in this dark and endless labyrinth." I'll make this house look more cozy! A real house and not a gallery of obsessions! I saw wonderful things in the antiquary. Tomorrow you'll give money to buy more delicate things. I don't want to see more aggressive things in this house. I'll throw some things away. I'll built a kitchen and change this bed! You can change everything you want. Our life will be great, Marcelo. Great... Because I love you. Because I want you. - Do you want one? - Yes. What's this crap? I never saw it before. Someone gave it to me when I was a child. It don't work. Well, he looks just like you. He has a silly face. Let me see it. Look. - See the resemblance? - Yes. The same face. A blank face. Look this! He doesn't has a weenie! Poor little Marcelo! But we'll take care of it. Done. A weenie for little Marcelo. If you two break it I'll spank both of you! I'm afraid! Renata! He's brave now that he has a weenie! Be careful, doctor. Let's start. It's big now! He has one now! Bravo! Stop playing with it now! With or without the weenie? Without it, of course. He doesn't deserve it. Why don't you give this fagot toy to your great-grandson? No. He'll return to his house. And he'll stay there. With no weenie. - Who's she? Your wife? - It doesn't matter. - I thought it was her. - Let me see! She's nice. Is she one of your old lovers? She looks like you. I know! She's your mother! I bet she is! Look where he bring his mammy! You father bought these jackets for her or she had a job? These rich people... Look her posture. It seems she doesn't live in our world. - It seems she's standing on money. - Let me see! - Why are we not like her? - Let me see! We have to fuck around just to get a little some. Like this. Deduct it from our pay! See, deduct it! It's nice, isn't it? What does it mean? Infinite. The universe is infinite. Must be nice to have a job like yours. Tell me about the stars. You looked happy when you were talking about it today. I've never saw someone so happy. When will it end? The galaxy, the stars... And do you think I know it? Nobody knows. But it will end one day, won't it? There are billions of galaxies in the universe. Each one has billions of stars. We can't calculate it. And there may be other universes. But it has to end sometime. It must end! Maybe yes, maybe no. There may be galaxies made ??of antimatter. Where the time can move around. Move to the past. To where we lived. It may mean that... - ...nothing ever ends. - What about the Earth? The sun expands before it ends. The Earth will become a very hot place. The oceans will evaporate. The forests will end. The atmosphere will move toward space. Nothing will be left. I think I'll put a sculpture here. And there... I think I'll put a totem. Did you like the idea? - It's a hint for me, isn't? - Of course. This upgrade is too expensive You spent all my money only with the sculptures. - And there's more. - I bought the best things to you. You have to stop to change this place. I like to change. I need it. I'll want to be paid the next time. Really? Will you accept money or... As well. You're getting too cocky. Maybe we can continue the "work". I'll give this up. We're having sex for four months since I started to sculpt your face. And you have a face almost impossible to carve. Marcelo... You don't have faces. I'd love to see what Rodin would do with your face. I'm sure he would prefer to sculpt your legs. He wouldn't make it. You, Marcelo... ...exist only from the neck down. I already told you can work in the office. But I think the best thing is to be a geisha. And what do you know about it? It would be easy with everything you're teaching me. A geisha has to do everything. That's right. Everything! But she also gets everything. Car... A house... Dance classes. Music classes. Why are you upset? Didn't you want to know? Sure. At least I can see you were honest about it. Was it all worth it? Was it good? Don't tell me, I already know: "it was good and it wasn't", right? That's it. It was like a pleasant nightmare. But there was always a... An anticlimax? The empty? The guilt? You don't need to theorize about it. - And your wife? - What do you mean? - What she was doing? - Nothing. I think she was waiting. Maybe she's naive. Or maybe very clever. What time I meet you tomorrow? I can't tomorrow. - Your boyfriend? - That and other things. A new exhibition will open and I need to study. I'm late. I have not done anything. - Will you call me? - If I have time. Are you sure? I won't have time, Marcelo. I'll be waiting, anyway. Don't wait for me. Not tomorrow. What's wrong? I said something? No, Marcelo. - And the day after tomorrow? - Maybe. I'll call you. Still awake? What do you think? - I'm not sleepwalking. - Sometimes I think you are. Me too. Maybe I'm sleepwalking since I was born. Or since I met you. I called you many times! You were not in your office! Yes, I wasn't. Why did you call me? - I wanted to talk with you. - Something's wrong? Very wrong. - Our daughter, again? - No. She's very well. - Very... - Do you think so? Yes! I think so! She's always well when you don't bother her. That's what you think. - You have to stop... - Don't be a fool! You know that we're the problem in this house. And we'll figure it out now. I won't wait anymore. I won't listen to you today. I don't want to! You will listen to me! Even if I have to kill both of us! Marcelo! Wait! You can't do this with me anymore! This will end today! That's enough! I can't stand anymore! Open the door! Good morning. Good morning. Are gonna eat your breakfast now? I just want a big cup of coffee. Sure. I don't want to fight anymore. Let's work it out once and for all. Dr. Marcondes put together all our goods for me. He does not know the number of stocks you have, but ... - I think it's a lot. - It's not that many. I can give him the information. It doesn't matter. And I don't care. I... I checked everything and I think I did a reasonable division. I didn't include the farm and the horses. You inherited from your mother before we married. I don't think you would share them. Neither do I. It's just yours. Thank you for your generosity. I think I'll keep this house. I don't know, but... ...you're never here. You have no attachment to it. And Berenice likes here. I think you wouldn't mind. Sure. Can I serve your coffee? Yes. I just want one thing from this house. Eugenio. The beach house worth less than this house. You can keep the most expensive apartments. But I think we should put them in the name of our daughter. Your apartment... ...the one your dear father gave to you... - I want you to keep it. - We can share it too. It might be useful for you. My jewelry, I inherited from my mother. The lands and the bank deposits... The company stocks... - We'll... - We have to talk about now? It bothers me! You do care about the money! The material goods! You're not fooling anyone. There's no use for it now! Do you think I'm just threatening you? But I assure you that I'll go until the end. Our end is always the same! You are a cynic! You wanna see me finished! You want to see me disappear! You're a sadist! Stop with the self pity! What's going on? Your mother are still bothering me with the same lamentations. I can't stand it anymore! I can't stand it anymore! - Are you trying to kill her? - Yes. Yes, I am. And if you bother me, I'll kill you too. Well, this is a good idea. Cyanide is enough for both of you. I'm not fooling around. If this continues like this, this is what will happen. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. Nothing ever happens. Everything will be the same. Do you ever thought... ...what kind of life you're living? Not yet. I let you think for myself. So much going on in the world. Everything is changing. The century is ending and you're still the same. We don't know what are you thinking about. But we know what are you doing. Do you think this is life? What about the others? And how's your life? I'm trying to be more open minded. Why are you laughing? I'm right! I'm studying, trying to figure things out. - I'm working. - Really? It's not a job, but it's work. I am doing social work with my group. Helping the poor! They exist, father! There are many people starving! It's nice that you're saying that while you're eating breakfast. Stop with that! I don't know how you can be like that. Year after year... When I was a child... I thought you was amazing! But now I can't understand you. And it's not because of my mother. I keep thinking about that. And the worst is... ...you could be better than you are . Something bigger. You know everything. You're intelligent. And at the same time, you don't understand the simplest things. Sometimes I think... what would have happened if you had been born poor. And had remained poor until now. And if you were born poor too? Don't say that. We're talking about you. I would know very well how to be poor. I;m sure about it. What are you looking? I'm a little fat. Is that? I need to fix this urgently. But I'm sure... ...I'm better than those girls you hang with. Someone saw you with a girl from my school. She's the same age as me. Or even younger. How could you? Dad. I don't know if you're cynical or unimpressive. If someone asked me to describe your face, I couldn't do it. I never see it in full. It's just some pieces. Each one thinking about something. Is everything alright? I tried not to come. But now I'm here. You know why I'm here, don't you? It's been three years, Marcelo. Three years! And now... ...I want money. Money, Marcelo! Money! I won't ask for it. You'll give to me. But I won't ask. I'll demand. Demand, Marcelo. I have the right to demand it! I have no desire to do anything! But don't think it's your fault. It's not. It is! And it is! But it doesn't matter anymore. I need money now! A lot of money! A lot for me, of course. I thought there wasn't problem to ask. Maybe you don't have the obligation. Maybe you do! You ruined my life. You ruined my life, Marcelo! - You didn't say that... - No, I didn't! I didn't. I was playing the strong and self sufficient woman. Indestructible. Lie! And if it makes you fell good... I know... You'll fell very good. I still can't get over it. It's a shame but it's true! I fell something burning inside! Burning! Every time I think about us. To meet someone like you.. ...it's the worst think that could happen with anyone. The worst thing. You're not evil, Marcelo. You do evil. You... ...make everything around you dry. Everything. But you'll suffer one day. Like you used to say... ...you'll be alone. No... ...you're already alone. You won't have anyone. Anyone, Marcelo. And I hope to be alive. No, I will be alive. To see that. To see that. They're all... ...bitches. Itself... ...bad defect. Itself... ...bad defect. Purity and impurity. Belong to each one. But how one attains enlightenment? We are already enlightened. Now and forever. There's nothing to expect. How can I train my mind? Training consists... ...of not training. What you saw was a piece of Andromeda. One of the nearest galaxies. But a ray of light takes more than two million years to get here. 2.400.000 to be exact. This is the delay for the light. Imagine for us. And it just over there in the backyard. Don't you feel sick thinking about that? I do. I don't. I feel the need of a more powerful tool. To go beyond. Far beyond. It's something endless. But let's talk about us. What happened? Nothing. This isn't true. We only meet when something is wrong. And it's always the same thing. I just wanted to see you. It's been a long time. A long time. Do you know how long? I don't know exactly. But it must be a lot. Three years at least. I know that because it was before I got this telescope. Who is the problem this time? Nobody. I wanted to see you. I needed to see you. I've heard that before. And you? Are you with someone? I mean... Why do you want to know? Sorry, forget it. Can I take you home? I have my car. When can we meet again? - Call me. - Tomorrow? I don't know. Call me. It's the same number. "Then he must realize..." "...that the beauty that is in any body whatsoever..." "...is related to that in another body." "It's great folly not to believe..." "...that the beauty of all bodies is one and the same." "And with this realization..." "...he must be the lover of all beautiful bodies." "And in contempt slacken this intensity for only one body." "In the belief that it is petty." "And he must believe that the beauty in souls..." "...is more honorable than that in the body." For Plato, the sensitive material world... ...it's the imperfect and provisional copy... ...of perfect and perennial models. The Symposium is the most beautiful and poetic dialogue of Plato. It's a work of unsurpassed beauty even today. You'll see that. The main idea, driven by Eros... ...god of love. Our soul is lifted by... ...the contemplation of ephemeral and physical beauty... ...to an universal beauty. It's a kind of erotic asceticism... ...that leads the man through the material... ...to contemplation of the divine. It's a sublime and elevated state. Your final exam will be about that. You'll write ten pages about The Symposium. What's wrong, Marcelo? Any questions? No, ma'am. No question. The book is easy to find. Read it with attention. It's one of the great moments of human creation. You're late. I thought you wouldn't come. I almost didn't. Your keys. - These are yours. - I don't want them anymore. I don't want to come here anymore. This place depresses me. You did like here. But now I don't like it. - I did something wrong? - No, nothing. I think this place has nothing to do with me. To me, all these things are artificial. Lifeless. And there's... ... there's too many ghosts. I can arrange a new place for you. Alright. But I want you to leave this place. Sell it. Give it or close it. Well... - I... - I knew it. You'll never leave. For anything. I didn't expect that. I was testing you. A few days ago I... I thought I had found my soul mate. For all my life. I had decided that... ...I wanted to stay with you forever. Nothing would matters. Age, opinions... I would stay with you even when you get older. When you would be alone. I'm sure that I could do that. But I want that! Or you think you want it. Maybe it isn't even that. I'm sure that you know deep inside that this all a big plan. A game that you plan and watch. All this talk about... ...be integrated. To be diluted in someone... This is all part of a game... ...you insist on playing. "So because Eros..." "...is the son of Penia, goddess of poverty..." "...and Porus, god of expediency..." "...his destiny is..." I can see and even hear... ...you seating there, talking with someone... ...saying that someone is waiting for you. That will always do. But this someone is me. "He's poor; and he's far from being tender and beautiful..." "...as the many believe." "And the lives just like his mother, in eternal misery." "But in accordance with his father..." "...he plots to trap the beautiful and the good." "He's neither immortal nor mortal." "But on the same day he flourishes and lives..." "...whenever he has resources." "Sometimes he dies, but gets to live again." "And as that which is supplied to him is always gradually flowing out." Our life will change. You'll see. You need to trust me. I'll settle things in a short time. And we'll disappear. We'll travel by ship. For some months. For many months. And after that... ...forever. You don't like here, do you? I'm the one who likes this music. It's my my nostalgia. We can go to another place if you want to. It's not the music, Marcelo. You know. I was thinking why... ...I always let myself get involved with you. I always give up my decisions. Today I... ...I came here to end this. All this nonsense. Suddenly I'm sitting here again. - The same thing. - Are you still mad with me? Give me some more time to sort things out. Don't ruin this night, Ana. C'mon, smile. The way I like it. Like a child, c'mon. Don't save the smile. Our trip will be amazing. You'll see. We'll be alone on the boat. No family, friends and telephone. Prepare your stuff. And what about my job? My school? Forget all that. We're leaving in a month. This is crazy! For me? All this? Who's there? I thought it was someone I knew. But she's an actress. I was wrong. - Are you sure? - Yes, why? Is something wrong? No, nothing. You can keep looking her if you want to. Don't start, Ana. I'm leaving now and you'll stay here. You won't do that. Don't talk. I don't want to hear you. My feelings are the same... ...but I don't want to see you again. Never again. And you'll respect that. Don't call me again. Ana! You can send this one. Ana. Wait. I told you I don't want to see you. I know, but I'm here. I want you back. I thought a lot about that. I can't live without you. You don't want me, Marcelo. You don't need me. I want you. I need you. But I won't have you. Believe, Ana. I want you! I want you bad! You don't want anyone, Marcelo. You never will. You have yourself. Goodbye, Marcelo. Ana. Suddenly I think she could be the sum of all. But it's nonsense. Nothing is the sum of all. But every piece of her upsets and stimulates me. And there's the erotic appeal too. Yes, even with the limitations... ...when Eros really appears... ...is the closest thing to God. It's like to see God in front of you. Or maybe to be God. I'll work tomorrow. - Come with me. - It depends. - C'mon. - Is it too far away? It's an amazing place. It's the last day of shooting. It's boring to watch but I love to do it! C'mon! Can I get there all by myself? - It's complicate, but... - I won't bother the director? He won't resist you. C'mon. It's like a castle... Like a... ...a ruin. You'll see. It's a strange and macabre place. The director is a little crazy. He's always searching for this kind of places. It's like a mill. No, it is a mill. But it's like... ...an old temple. It's beautiful. - I think I know this place. - You do? Yes, very much. Leo! Hello, dear. I'm sorry I'm late. - It's raining a lot! - Go change your cloths. This is Marcelo, a friend of mine. Leonardo is the director. - He can watch the shooting? - Sure. So you stay here, baby. You can drink some coffee. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Excuse me. Did you guys understand it? Don't forget that this movie is about love. The ambiance is about politics. The facts are about politics. But it's a love story. Well, all the stories are about love. Even when there's power involved. And don't act gentle. I want to see anger in everybody! You have to act like animals! Like hungry bears! The anger is essential! Here's the gun. Finally something is right here. Good. Ana! I need to show you how to hold this gun! Ana, will it take long? Take this gun. Weapons are erotic objects. You have to use it in a sensual way. The way you hold it is very important. Hold it. One more thing, Roberto. In this scene with her, the violence must be contained. But it must be terrible. We must have the felling that you can kill her at that moment. Like this. Hard, got it? With anger. The hand of love and death. Do it for me. You do it know. The gesture is important. And be careful with the gun. Let me see it. This is not good. It's must be dirtier.
