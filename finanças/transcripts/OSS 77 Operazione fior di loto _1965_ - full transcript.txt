'OSS 77 Operation Lotus Flower' 'A secret location in China' There's a meeting with the director at seven... Professor Fu Chu Yen has disappeared and we think he's trying to defect... The consequences of such an escape are incalculable... We must take emergency measures immediately. "Attention, attention..." "Professor Fu Chu Yen has disappeared from the atomic centre..." "Sound the alarm and set up roadblocks." Attention, attention... Professor Fu Chu Yen has disappeared from the atomic centre... "Sound the alarm and set up roadblocks." Quick, get in... We're crossing the border. You're a free man now. That depends on your point of view. Who knows if I'll ever come back? Patrol R-6 calling Red Dragon... Fu Chu Yen has boarded a private plane and is heading towards Pakistan... We tried to everything to stop him but we failed. We're returning to base. Over and out. I really wasn't expecting Operation Lotus Flower to go so smoothly. It's up to you now. You have to get him to Madrid... They won't let him get away so easily, look out for enemy planes. I guess you have to take the rough with the smooth. You can refuel in Tehran and Istanbul before you pass Rome. Okay, I'll do my best. Welcome... Colonel Mclinton, Captain McCoy. The Captain will take you to Madrid where another plane will take you to the States... On behalf of the American government, good luck! A-21 calling Red Dragon... - Over, over. - We're listening. Professor Fu Chu Yen has taken off on board flight U-43... Sabotage impossible, the plane... My cover has been blown! Over and out. Start walking. Damned yellow worms! They'd rather die than talk. We have received news from agent A-21 at the American base in Pakistan... That professor Fu Chu Yen has taken off on board USAF flight U-23... Then he ceased communication, saying he had been found out... Yes, sir. Attention, attention... All stations, locate special flight U-43... We assume it's heading west... The plane took off from coordinates 17, 48, 22... Attention! "Attention, attention, urgent message for Operation Lotus Flower... "Enemy planes approaching, monitor radar and maintain radio contact." Hear that, professor? They're looking for you. They're wasting more fuel on you than all the cars in New York in a week. Come in base... - Aircraft 75 calling base. - We read you. I've located flight U-43, heading west, 32, 71... Reference 12. Coordinates: 76, 20... Speed, 817. Altitude, 8700... - Awaiting orders. - This is Red Dragon... Message received. Orders for aircraft 75. I repeat, orders for aircraft 75... Take out flight U-43. Over. Aircraft 75 to Red Dragon, received... Following orders. Over and out. Professor, they're on top of us... I don't know any Chinese saints but if they do exist put in a good word for me. Check your parachute because you're going to need it. If you make it to the ground, just stay put. Whatever happens, good luck. Aircraft U-43 calling base... We're under attack from enemy aircraft... Altitude, 8700. Wind, 2-19, north-west... Coordinates, 13-21. Speed 800... I must abandon the aircraft... Initialising self-destruct. Over. - Are you injured, professor? - I think so. - How do you feel? - I think I've broken something. Try to free your arms and hold on to me. We must find somewhere to hide, there are some ruins nearby. Hold on to me. We might be able to hide in here. It's some sort of huge annex. Lie down here. We got real lucky, I didn't think we'd make it... Almost makes me believe in fate. Fate? Just think, Captain... Us scientists often wrestle with the fate of all mankind... And often the burden of a new discovery can be too much to bear. It's not your fault, We must all take responsibility... You get some rest. I'll deal with the parachutes. We came down in Italy, somewhere near Rome. - Want a cigarette? - No thanks. As the minister is well aware, they're all busy on other missions. But don't worry, I'm sending Robert Kent to find them. Okay, that's fine. Yes... Goodbye. - Is this 007 coming? - He's busy on mission Goldfinger. - And the others? - All the 00 agents are busy... But they suggested Robert Kent. He's young and he's very able. That baby faced fool? His Italian is good, perhaps that's why they chose him. - Then why isn't he here? - They're still trying to locate him. Hello, who's speaking? It's me... Yes. Yes. I understand... Of course. I'm on my way. - I have to go. - No... Professor... It's morning. We're somewhere near Rome, we're surrounded by ruins... I'm going to try and contact someone in the C.I.A... Our intelligence service. We're forbidden from contacting our embassy on missions like this. Don't you worry, I'll be back soon. Hello. I'm Ottavia's cousin... Aunt Antonia has given birth to her third son. - What name have they chosen? - Marcello. - I have an urgent message. - Go ahead. 269, 714, 11, 15, 13 9, 21, 16, 15, 24, 7 - Please hurry. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Okay, thanks. Hello. Yes, there's been a call... First they exchanged some phrases, evidently for identification... Then a series of numbers. I recorded everything. Sure... Okay. Morocco, Fred called... Rossi received a phone call... First they exchanged phrases for identification, then a series of numbers... - Fred recorded everything. - Okay, go back to the office. NZ-100 calling Alpha-1... - This is Alpha-1, what is it? - Go to the antiques dealer... Something important has happened... Follow him and make sure you aren't noticed... And send Fred with the tape. Maintain contact. I'm going out. There he is. I'm going to see the boss. Imbecile! You almost hit me! A Cinzano. Hello... Operation Lotus Flower has been interrupted... The professor is wounded, I'm going to get him... Inform Washington immediately. I'll prepare a detailed report tonight. Good evening. Sir. - Who was it this time? - A redhead, sir. Sooner or later they're going to get you land you in trouble! I've done okay so far. - It's a simple mission, a real holiday. - But I was already on holiday! A noted Chinese scientist, professor Fu Chu Yen, an expert on atomic energy... Contacted one of our agents in China... Claiming he has some information of great importance... He wants to speak directly to the President and The United Nations. - Do I have to go to China? - No, Italy... Because the plane carrying the professor crashed just outside Rome... We have an agent in the area who should have made contact with him by now. You must go to Rome... Find the professor and get him on board a submarine waiting near Fiumicino. But be careful because we heard a certain organisation by the name of Nazi-2... Is also very interested in this case... You can contact the C.I.A. for the rest of the details. These are the President's credentials as requested by Fu Chu Yen... I don't need to tell you how important that document is. Now hurry. And good luck. Thank you, sir. How are you feeling? Can you make it that car over there? He needs medical attention. Be careful, the car has been identified by a criminal gang known as Nazi-2. That's him. But that isn't Rossi. - The license plate matches. - Call the Moroccan. This is Pete, Rossi's car is back but there's someone else driving it. - Can you get him? - We'll try. - I'll wait here. - Okay. - He says to get him - Okay. Excuse me, do you know the way to Via Mastai? No, sorry, I'm not from around here. Get in. Don't cause a scene. Move it! I guarantee I'll make you talk. Let's hear your voice. There's no need to be like that. I don't like violence. They used to call me the gentle Moroccan when I was a kid... Why do you force me to use more persuasive methods? I made mutes sing in Morrocco, and they weren't bad, either. You don't want to talk? We'll see about that! Diana. Do what you want. He's all yours. Poor boy, I'll take care of you. I don't know anything! Take him to the press. - Good evening. - I brought the professor. I'll bring the x-ray equipment, something must be broken... - He must have suffered a lot. - I haven't heard him complain. I'm entrusting him to you doctor, this is exceptionally important... He has to make it to Washington to meet the President. The operation is called 'Lotus Flower'. The secret code is... "I'm Ottavia's cousin, aunt Antonia has given birth to her third son..." The reply: "What name have they chosen?" I'm telling you this in case I don't come back. The operation is called 'Lotus Flower'... I don't know any more. I swear... I don't know any more. Let me out! - I told you he'd talk. - Let's give him another squeeze. If you think you can get one over on me then you're mistaken. He's dead. Turn it off. Faster. Pull him out. - I'll be staying at The Hermitage. - You told me. Well we all have the right to repeat ourselves. - What do say? - Okay, I'll call you later. - If it's no trouble. - My father. - I'm looking forward to it. - Me too! - Taxi? - Yes, thanks. - A problem with the engine. - I figured. Who sent you? - I don't know. - What about now? I work for the Chinese, they sent me. - Where do I find them? - I don't know, they call me. - Anything else? - No, I swear! - What did you tell him? - Nothing. - You'd better start talking! - He asked about the Chinese... But I don't know them. It didn't work. I had to fire Fred. Okay, we'll come back to base. Freeze! Drop the gun. Hands up. Move away from there. Come on, start walking. There's someone who wants to talk to you... But first I want to tell you something... - The Moroccan wanted him alive. - Who cares? 'OSS-77', we'd better show this to the boss. Come in. They left these keys, the car is outside. Put them there. Thank you! Good morning. - Isn't Mr. Rossi here? - No, he had some business to attend to. When will he return? I'm not sure I can answer that. Is there anything I can do? He promised me a jade necklace for my new dress, I sing at Club 69. I don't have any jade necklaces, but I can offer you an aperitif. - Thanks! - Is that a yes or a no? Yes, thanks! To your health. - You were great. - Let's not exaggerate! - Yes? - Robert, it's Eva... As you can see, I kept my promise and I'm all yours tonight... Up to a certain point! I'll show you Rome by night. Okay, but I have to stop off at my embassy, can we meet in half an hour? - Okay, half an hour. - Let's say an hour. - An hour. - In an hour by the hotel. You know secret agents aren't welcome at the embassy... Especially in Italy, the police here don't mess around... We don't want any trouble. I'm agent Robert Kent on a special mission, I'd ask you to reflect... I'm not here to cause trouble, I need information... First, tell me if there's a secret agent behind these lines... Second... Rome C.I.A. agent Rossi and another one I don't know... ...were both killed by someone trying to interfere with Operation Lotus Flower... I don't have any other leads to locate Fu Chu Yen. Third, I have some photos of a woman who approached me suspiciously... I want to know who she is. Finally, I need someone in Rome I can trust in case I need help... I'm staying at The Hermitage, room 805... Inform Washington immediately and let me know via the usual channels. Goodbye. He just left the embassy, he said he'll meet me at the club... Don't let him out of your sight. I'm going to see the Moroccan. Robert! Finally! I was about to leave. You're ten minutes late! Sorry, I got held up. I'll forgive you this time, but don't let it happen again. Promise! I can't explain now, but you must do as I say. Don't ask any questions but you have to get out when I stop the car... I'm being followed and I don't want to see you get hurt. I don't understand? Get out. - Black belt? - Third Dan. Me too! Enough of the pleasantries... Are you the boss or do you work for someone else? - There's someone else. - I'll let you go this time... But you have to tell your boss I'm tired of his methods... And if he wants to talk to me, he'd better show some manners. Tell him this is his last chance. From now on I'm going to get heavy... Very heavy! I'm sure the boss will be glad to meet you, but where can we find you? At Club 69, after midnight. - Anything else? - No, thank you. Mr Wilson? There's a call for you. Mr. Wilson, I have taken your request into consideration... If you agree, my boss would like to meet you... A car will be waiting for you outside the club in a few minutes. What guarantee do I have that it isn't a trap? - None, just our assurance. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - How long till the car arrives? - Exactly ten minutes. Okay, thanks. Grab a car and follow Wilson. - You were amazing. - Who was it? A woman? No, some friends. I have to go. - Okay, what about tonight? - I'll try not to keep you waiting. - Bye. - See you later. - Mr. Wilson? - Yes. Mr. Wilson, try to stay calm, and don't waste your energy... You've trusted us up to now, and you must continue to do so... Thank you. We need clarification. Start talking! - Who are you working for? - I don't know! - What do you want with the American? - I don't know. Your friend wanted to prevent you from talking. Good evening, Mr. Kent. Or do you prefer Wilson? - We were worried you wouldn't wake up. - I always have a nap after meals. And we have given you this opportunity. We've been interested in your well-being since you left Washington. Yes, I noticed the moment I landed in Fiumicino. I hope you realise it was only joke... If we had wanted you dead, you wouldn't be here now. But jokes aside, you must excuse us... But one can never be too careful. There's an ancient Chinese proverb... He who looks for the spring will eventually find water. Tradition dictates that we should talk about our families... But I've come to learn that traditions don't mean very much in Europe. My business, Mr. Wilson, is of an official nature... My country would rather professor Fu Chu Yen doesn't deliver his message... We know the professor was injured when he parachuted from the plane... And we're sure you've taken good care of him... But we'd like to impose upon you, my dear Mr. Wilson... And your noble country... To negotiate his return to us. I'm not authorised to negotiate, but I can speak to my superiors... And give you an answer tomorrow. Very well, we shall contact you tomorrow... In order to conclude this matter more decisively. - My men will accompany you. - Like last time? I have nothing against you personally... I must say, for an American you're very polite... But we must take precautions... When you find the lair, you catch the fox. - In that case I guess I'm very lucky. - Thank you. Take Mr. Wilson where he wishes to go. - To tomorrow. - To tomorrow. Robert! I called you twenty times, what happened? Then I came here, I almost fell asleep. - It's a miracle I saw you. - I didn't know how to contact you. - That's why I waited for you. - Come on, let's go up. You've got some explaining to do, leaving me in the middle of nowhere like that... I was upset at first, then I figured you did it for me... Perhaps you were in danger? - My tailor was chasing me. - That isn't funny. I think you're hiding something... - What exactly do you do? - Antiques dealer. We've arrived. No, let's take it slowly. Not in some sad hotel room... You're still just a child. I couldn't live with myself. - Robert! - No, Eva, I'm a gentleman... - I never met a gentleman like you before. - Me neither! I didn't tell him. It's for you. Hello? Who is this? I understand... Okay, but tell him we'll settle the bill at the end. - What happened? - Nothing, they killed Fred. - Who was it? - Formosa's murdering henchmen. Get me a whiskey. Hold on. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Your breakfast. They brought in your car. Here are the keys. - Anything else? - No. I was wrong yesterday, you aren't great, you're dynamite! Who is it? May I? The United States Embassy is pleased to invite you for breakfast... In honour of Saveri Borudi from Pakistan, on Saturday the 21st at one o'clock. - Then we won't have breakfast together? - It won't be possible... But we can have dinner together. Okay. I'll get dressed. 'We have no record of a secret agent with the prefix O.S.S. 77...' 'But the Silos Sabaudia Organisation has a clinic in the Aprilia area...' 'The telephone number is 892461. The woman in the photo is a Nazi-2 agent' That didn't take long. I'll see you later. Get me 892-461. "I'm Ottavia's cousin, aunt Antonia has given birth to her third son..." Yes... Yes, at the second race. He received an invitation from his embassy... It must be something important because he hid it... - I think something big is going down. - Okay, you go back to the club. Put the transmitter in his car. - Excuse me, Mr. Kent. - You must be mistaken. No, I don't think so... Please listen to me, you see, lately... You've been approached by certain Chinese people... I want you to know that they don't represent The People's Republic... They're working with Formosa. - Well? - We wanted to be sure you knew... - It's important you don't confuse us. - I was already aware of it. "I'm Ottavia's cousin, aunt Antonia has given birth to her third son..." I know the first two children... - Sorry, where was I? - It doesn't matter. I'm all yours. - A war wound? - No, a banana skin. - Mind if I cash in my bet? - Not at all. Stay in contact with the transmitter, and don't get too close. Now you know everything. Let's hope the professor really is there. But poor Rossi, he was a brave man... And he did his duty to the last. An SS-77, a real find. Get closer, I don't want to lose them. - Good morning. - I'm Ottavia's cousin. OSS-77, Silos Organisation... It never occurred to me. This is our chance. The professor is in there. - The President's credentials. - I'm glad you're here... I feel so isolated and I have no idea what's going on. Formosa's men are very interested in you. Yes, I'm not surprised, but they're mistaken if they think I'm a traitor. Do you mind leaving us alone for a moment. My boy, I'll be frank... I don't know how this is going to end... So I'm going to tell you what I'm going tell the president and The United Nations... I want to warn you that my country, the People's Republic of China... Is also in possession of an atomic bomb... You can't threaten China with atomic bombs now... And any provocation could cause a catastrophe... I want the world to know, because, knowing this... Peace will be reinforced... And peace will aid my country in peaceful progress. You'll be able to tell the United Nations soon enough... - How are you feeling? - I'm well enough. - Do you think you can travel? - I think so. Then let's go. Doctor, we're leaving. Thank you, doctor, I will always be indebted to you. Good luck, professor. Goodbye. - What happened? - A car ran into me. - We'll take you to hospital. - No, take me home, I live close by. Help me, professor. - Your bike? - I'll send someone to get it. We've arrived, it's the last gate. Get out. Please, madam. - Welcome, Mr. Wilson. - Quite a trap! We trust you won't try anything foolish. As you can see, we've been expecting you... Aware of your kind nature... We knew you wouldn't have left her in the middle of the road... And you've also been kind enough to deliver Professor Fu Chu Yen to us. - You have to know how to lose sometimes. - I'm glad you're taking it so well. - Lock them up. - I'll go with them. Hurry, we need to go back to the city. Come, professor... You're my guest now. Open it. No... I can do this myself. Hold on, I owe you for the ride, I never leave debts outstanding. Me neither. Wake up! We're in a real mess. I wouldn't complain, at least we're alive. Hello? It's her. Yes... Okay, sure... They accepted. It's going down tomorrow. Get the professor and bring him here. What about me? - I've never had a Chinese professor. - Forget it... He's worth a lot of money and we need him in good shape. Let's go. - Someone's coming. - Must be dinner time. Exactly what I was waiting for. - Unscrew my foot. - What? Unscrew my left foot. - Great shot! - Help me put my foot back on. Wait, I'll attach it. Let's get out of here. Help me. Push, don't be afraid. - You really know what you're doing! - Let's find the professor. The Chinese! The Chinese are here! It's a pleasure to meet you, professor Fu Chu Yen. We're proud of countrymen like you... We Chinese never forget... I remember what you did to my brother... Now it's your turn to suffer. You must pay! I don't have time to waste. Where are Nazi-2? Where have they taken the professor? Don't lie to me. I know exactly what's going on... We were good together, I like you, and I don't want to hurt you. Just tell me. They've taken him to the docks in Fiumicino. I'm sorry, Kate, but listen to me... Pack your bags. Leave tonight... The air here stinks and it's only going to get worse... You deserve better. - Let's go. - Yes. All I see are dead bodies. One of them was still alive, over there. - Where do we go now? - Formosa Business Holding. - Surprised to see me so soon? - How did you get in here? I have my ways. If I'm not mistaken we had a telephone appointment this afternoon. I couldn't wait. What a coincidence, I was just dreaming of you. Really? How? Like this! I'm sorry but when the mouse bites the cheese it's already trapped. Would that be your version of a Chinese proverb? As you wish... Now get up. Take me to the professor. And watch out... One false move and you'll join your ancestors in the cemetery in Formosa. - Who told you? - I read it on the license plate... Formosa Business Holding. It isn't for you. Stop! I said stop! The kids have been punished, professor, we can go. Go on ahead. - Thanks for the company. - You win this time. - I always win. - I hope we meet again. - Let's go. - I had given up all hope. We'll be safe at the hotel. My car is parked over there. My colleague has already gone to Fiumicino to arrange your departure. - Mr. Wilson, it's five o'clock. - Thanks. Ms. Eva has called a number of times. She's on the line now... - Shall I put you through? - Go ahead. Robert, you've been a real gentleman. I've decided, I want to be yours. - Yes, dear. - Shall I come to you? No, I have to take a friend to Fiumicino, he's leaving for New York... - Meet me at the docks at seven. - Okay. It's time to go. Read all about it! China explodes first atomic bomb! 'China Explodes First Atomic Bomb' Do you mind stopping and getting me some cigarettes? Thanks. It makes sense... It was the only thing they could do... They had to bring the test forward six months, now I understand... If I had announced it, I would have been branded a spy... But it all worked out okay, after all... After all, it's what I wanted... Who knows if what I've done has served a purpose... The Chinese people are guaranteed peace now... While I have become a traitor, someone who has chosen freedom... And I cannot accept that. Thanks. - Well here we are, good luck. - Thanks. - Goodbye, professor. - Watch that foot! Robert! Eva! Good luck. It's so beautiful. Sea sick? Go down. What happened? Where is he? - Who? - There was a dead man in the cabin. You've been reading too many spy novels. Subtitled by Professor Fu Chu Yen and the Pagan Receptionists... THE END
