There's no way we can abandon our affiliates. And even so, this is too different from your original proposal. We understand. But unfortunately, we recently got our hands on some financial reports for Maeda Motors and its seven affiliated companies. It appears the accounts for the last two years have been heavily manipulated. I'm sure none of you, nor Mr. Mitsuyoshi for that matter would want this to become public knowledge. I have no plans to abandon your affiliates. However, we'll discuss the details further in Korea once the final audit is complete. Good day, gentlemen. Starring UHM Jung-hwa Directed by KIM Sang-woo SEDUCING MR. PERFECT I like the city. I get my full share of nature at organic restaurants. Coffee, shopping, entertainment! This is my beloved trinity. If I had an overflowing mileage card, I'd travel to all the world's cities. And then one day, my chance came. My boyfriend's business trip to Hong Kong. So I decided to call in sick and go along with him. A secret rendezvous, plus exploring the city... all in one go! But that day... he never showed up. And his cell phone was switched off. Is it possible to find a love that won't make me lonely? That makes me warm and happy? And is this man the true love I'm looking for? Oh, damn... How could you stop like that all of a sudden? What are you smirking about? Oops... Gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it. Look, I don't have time for this, so give me your business card. Huh? Your business card. What, you don't speak English? No! I don't speak English. Not a word! Then give me your phone number. Oh, gosh... I have no idea what you're saying. Phone number! Hello? Jun-hyoung? Sorry, it's Sun-young. How was the trip? Trip, my ass... I got stood up in Hong Kong. What? That punk disappeared again? He'll call today. It's his birthday. Hey, is the appendix on the right or left? I told the company I was getting my appendix removed. I'll call you back. What are you doing? Huh? What do you think you're doing? Now I have your picture. I have your phone number. I'll call you with the bill. Hey, look! Erase the photo. My photo! Hey, I said erase the photo! Hello? Hey asshole! Ms. Kim, did the surgery go well? Surgery?... Sure... While you were at it, you should've removed some belly fat. Looks like you got a tire around your waist. Jesus! Don't take it so hard! I wish I had some belly fat. I think it's cute. Tadpole belly... Wait, while you were gone, there was some big news! The new branch president flew in from the U.S. headquarters. Wasn't he supposed to arrive later? And what about the director? He was just a temporary appointment. A fox sleeping in a tiger's cave... Anyway, my point is, the new guy's specs are out of this world. Specs? His name's Robin Heiden, age 31. Harvard Law School, and of course an MBA. He speaks 5 languages, and is an expert in M&As. Headquarters sees him as potential CEO material. Isn 't it fantastic? That's good, Steven. OK. This is June from the M&A team. She will be your assistant, starting today. Assistant? She's been in charge of research on the Maeda company. June, introduce yourself. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure to see you again. I am so sorry. I was so confused this morning, I... If you find English difficult, please feel free to speak Korean. Pardon me? Just speak in Korean! He understands Korean quite well. Though he finds speaking a bit challenging. So from now on, he'll speak English and we will speak Korean. Respecting each other's language and raising our work efficiency. Isn't his suggestion just perfect for this global era? By the way, Ms. June? Yes? It says here you took a sick leave for an appendix removal. Is the left side of your stomach okay? Yes, it's fine. That's good. By the way, the appendix is on the right side. You'll have to excuse me. I have an appointment to catch. So I will see both of you at the party tonight. June, you've met him before? No, we just said hi in the elevator... But why was I chosen? How would I know? He singled you out himself. Singled me out? And by the way... Tonight's the party, can you go dressed like that? Remember tonight's the party. Ms. June, do you have a different party to attend to later tonight? What? Yes, my friends are having a wine party. You actually look quite nice in that dress, I'm surprised. Thank you! It'll come in handy in your mission later tonight. My mission? See those two men over there in striped ties? Oh, those two? They're Englishmen. I see them. They're with Remix Holdings our competitor in the Maeda deal. Mr. Mitsuyoshi is here tonight, he's the president of Maeda. So I need you to get as close as possible to them. Pretend that you can't speak English. And find out everything you can about their meeting with Mitsuyoshi. That's your mission. Wait, you're saying... So you want me to spy on them? Isn't corporate data collection your specialty, Ms. June? You were so good this morning at pretending you couldn't speak English. But that was... this morning was... Robin! Well look who we have here? Hey, Nancy. Go ahead. So I get the work, and you get to have fun? Am I some sort of James Bond? Oh my god, I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, Are you OK? It's quite alright, these things happen. Are you alright? I am alright. I am sorry. Have yourself a good evening then. You too. i'm sorry. June, you're really on a roll tonight. What should I do? I blew my cover. What? I spoke in English! Shit! What do I do now? Figure it out! Steal their documents, if you have to! Jesus! I didn't expect to meet you here. But I'm sure you're well aware of those facts. Of course. It's my job to know the facts. You know? By the way, who's the chap over here talking to the president? You don't think he's with the competition, do you? I wouldn't worry. Nobody knows the president's at the party except for us. And besides, our real rivals are the Americans, not that yellow monkey. Remix Holdings seems to be in a slump lately... And there's a rumor that your interests were at stake, since the failed merger with Neutreal Company... is that true? Well, there'll be a big deal for us too, soon. Oh really? I knew that! Oh, don't worry. I'm not here to give a report. You don't have to worry. Off the record? Of course! Off the record! Vision? Ripping a company apart and selling it off... is that your vision? Very well. Bypassing the board and attempting insider trading with Remix Holdings... Is that your vision? I'll show you real vision. Wait and see. Well that was well done, Ms. June. I did not expect you to obtain such classified information like that. Well done? It was their own piksari. Piksari? What's that? It was their own mistake... their fault! Sorry, I still don't... F.A.U.L.T... Fault! Oh! Fault! Fault. You have to enunciate that. This is why I can't stand foreigners. Yes it is true... In business, one man's loss is another man's gain... Doing business like this, I'll soon be a swindler. The way I see it, you seem to have a special talent for deception. Huh? That's a compliment, from me. All right, then how about this kind of business? Since I scored one today, let's call the car issue tungchigi. - Okay? - Tungchigi? What's that? It means, let's forget it. Absolutely not. That's personal. Nothing to do with business. You stingy... My phone! Hello, Jun-hyoung? Boyfriend? Never mind. This is personal. Privacy! The phone is off now, you have to record... You know if he calls and hangs up, but doesn't answer your calls, he's hiding something. On what basis are you saying that? That's what I do when I cheat. If you don't believe me, try again. Why don't you get out? I don't want advice from a man who's had affairs across the globe, but has never experienced true love. True love, huh? What exactly is this 'true love' you're referring to? Bang! Like being hit in the heart by a bullet... do you know that feeling? A bullet? I was hit by a bullet once, but from a real gun. Oh yes, of course you were. True love means to share your hearts, and not be lonely, to be warm, happy, that sort of thing. There's no such thing. There is! Where is it? Here! Then why is it, Ms. June, that when I look at you, I see anything but a happy person? Let's go! I'll buy you dinner. Thanks, but I have a very important date. Have a nice evening. Hello. Hey, June! I'll catch up with you. So you had a wild night on your boyfriend's birthday? What are you talking about? Why deny it? We've pulled all-nighters at work before. I can tell from the way you look. I didn't even get to see his face, so lay off! What? You stayed out all night, but didn't meet your boyfriend? Is he cheating on you or something? God, don't try to jinx me! What did I tell you last night? The man has something to hide. You two like rubbing salt in my wounds, huh? - He said he'd be there soon. - Okay. Get yourself something good to eat. All right. I'm not his assistant, I'm a slave. He could have given me this work earlier. Excuse me. Thank you. I only regret one thing from my past two failed relationships. Why couldn't I have acted with more intelligence? With style, and grace! That's what I'll do. How could you do this to me? You bastard! Tell me, you jerk! How could you do that? Ma'am. Don't touch her! - Honey, who is this lady? - What? Please, you can't do this here. Can you discuss this outside? Jun-hyoung, you can't do this to me. Let's go home, okay? Why do you always act like this? Can't you give me some space? What? You're the one who made me this way, you know? Don't call me anymore. Let's go. I'm sorry. Hi? Why have I been dumped three times now? Because you don't know the rules. - Rules? - The rules of the game! Love isn't like playing Starcraft, you know. Yes, it is. It's actually a game that requires even greater precision and planning. A game of power. Manipulations of emotions to control the mind... That's the game. Oh, it is a game. It's a game where the one who displays affection first, gives up total control and goes around like a dog on a collar. In relationships, you were the one to call first, and he was the one to hang up first, right? Right. And when you got together, you'd always run to him and you always give him gifts on anniversaries, only you, right? Right! How did you know that? I know because these are the consequences of dating without any self respect, Ms. June. That's how I know. So take my advice, and this is sincere, so listen to me. If you continue acting like this, being so... pathetic, you will always be treated like trash by men. And you'll grow old... all by yourself. Apologize! What would I be apologizing for? I've never apologized for anything in my life. What's wrong with admitting that I love him? What's wrong with calling or visiting him because I'm worried? What's wrong with wanting to do everything for him? What? I'll be treated like trash all my life? Screw you! I could have a line of guys begging for me if I wanted. I could, but I don't. You know why? You could? Then make me beg for you. If you succeed, I will apologize on my knees. A woman who was just dumped needs a shoulder to cry on, not a critic. 'It's not your fault.' 'He just wasn't the right guy for you' A friend who can say this. Have you been drinking? One bottle of beer. Not a case of beer? Why are your eyes so swollen? Dad, my friends are all scared of their fathers, but why do I feel like we're friends? We're both getting old together, maybe that's why. What are you looking at? Something your mom gave me, exactly 34 years ago. Mom? My mom? Why, hard to believe? I can't believe it either. Adults should set an example for their children. Throwing trash everywhere, the whole town is a trash can. - You're here? - Mom... When did you arrive? Just before. What happened to your face? Were you drinking again? No, what do you mean? - Dad... about what you... - What's gotten into you? You bastard. Why did I like you? You're nice. Why did I stop liking you? Cause you're nice. Nice people are boring. When did I ever ask you for an allowance? Getting meals is embarrassing enough. Do you think you're my mom? Can't you give me some space? You're the one who made me do this. You'll always be treated like trash by men, like a showgirl. And you'll grow old... all by yourself. What kind of nightmare is that? Just you wait, Robin Heiden. I'm going to make you beg on your knees to me. Hello? Mi-hwa? In most wars, the weapons are guns and missiles. But in this kind of war, they're the newest hairstyles and dresses. A beautiful weapon that will make the enemy's heart pound. Let's see who the winner is. Ms. June? Okay, I've got you now. Yes? Is that your grandmother's dress? It's very similar to my grandmother's pajamas. First operation, failed. This time, it's Operation Angel. I'll give you the hand of evil lurking behind an angel's smile. Would you like some coffee, sir? June, did you clean up my office? Bingo! It was a bit messy, so I... Just when did I ask you to do that? Yes? Where is the uniform? What uniform? Oh, that! I gave it to the cleaning lady. ring it back to me, right now!! Operation Angel, failed. Jeonjeon Industrial Machinery? Thank you. Then, I'll handle this as you requested. Yes. Special measures need to be taken. Bolder, more powerful! If physical warfare is ineffective, turn to psychological warfare. Hi. Why are you here? Well, I... I need to talk to you. This couldn't wait until tomorrow? I want to die! You what? Request his counsel on difficult matters and bring out his soft side... Here we go! So what did you want to talk about? I guess you were right, sir. Whenever I fall in love, I become a complete idiot. I can't continue this way much longer. What should I do? Are you listening to me? I'm listening. Keep going... So help me, would you? With what? Last time you said love is a game. Teach me the rules of the game. I can't do that! You can't? That's right. I said I can't! Why? Why can't you? What's the reason? The reason? It's because it's impossible to upgrade from a 386 system to a Pentium. Your brain might stop functioning, from a fatal error. Are you telling me that my brain is a 386? When a piece of stock has no future, you have to know when to cut your losses and when to sell. Relationships are the same, if there's nothing left to salvage, you cut your losses and you sell. Ms. June, how do you expect me to teach you anything if you don't even know the basics. The 386 got waterlogged and totally malfunctioned. What now? It must really pain you to pay a high salary to a soggy 386. Where are you going? The soggy 386 is going to withdraw. Good night. Ms. Min-june. Let me make a suggestion. What is he up to? You want June to take charge of the deal? What's wrong with assigning a job to an employee? Nothing. It's just that Brian is familiar with the whole project... Brian, do you still want to be in charge of this project, too? Yes, of course I do! O K. then. I think the two of you should come up with a strategy for the Brighton deal. The one with a better concept will take charge. No problems then? Yoon-mi. Hold on. Yes? The meeting's not over yet? It seems like it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, the valuation report in an information memorandum produced by Brighton had applied the value marked prior to the modification. I believe a discount of 10% is feasible. That's all. Good! Next! I think the appropriate line of negotiation is about 30% lower than the price they suggest. So you are planning to increase the rate by 20%? Yes. That's possible. According to an insider from GS Bank, Stanley, one of the main shareholders of Brighton, has disposed all of his shares in an equity swap deal. Gosh, I can't believe it. Me getting such a big deal. Did you see their faces during my presentation? It's a bit presumptuous of me to say this... But don't you think I really did a great job? Don't assume anything until the contract's signed. Jeez... What's wrong? I feel bad about it. About what? I don't know. I just feel sorry for him. You see that. That is another reason why men leave you. What? Listen to me very carefully. Your indecisiveness, your being overly sensitive, will not only damage your love life but your career as well. Damn you... The operations must go on. No matter what. - What are you doing? - You scared me. What are you doing now? I'm packing lunch. Don't you think I can see that? Why are you doing it so seriously? I'm out to catch a yellow monkey. What? Fatten yourself up. I'm going to catch and eat you. Yoon-mi, did the president go somewhere? He went out a little while ago. Why? Nothing. Yoon-mi, where did you get this? Oh, Robin said I could have it. What? Some air-headed bimbo must be hitting on him. She ought to stay within her league. I wonder what's inside. What's wrong with you, Miss Kim? Yoon-mi, do you suppose I could have this? What? Why should you have it? It's mine. Give it back. Miss Kim! Miss Kim. Miss Kim. What's with you? Miss Kim! Miss Kim! Miss Kim! Do you have to be so persistent? Miss Kim! Miss Kim! Are you OK, sir? Yeah! Sorry about that. Yeah I'm so embarrassed. My god. Where could it have gone? Where did it fall out? Hi, Sun-young. Today? What's the occasion? A blind date? I'm leaving. Hey. Sit down, will you? Sun-young, I appreciate your thought, but I'm not that desperate yet. Not that desperate? Look, are you still not over that bastard? Don't call Jun-hyoung a bastard. Okay fine, 'Jun-hyoung'. Aren't you over him yet? I don't know. Hey, wake up, will you? Just look at my marriage. Love. Romance. Sounds great when you're young. But later, money is love, and money is romance. So listen to me today for once. The guy coming today is a friend of my brother-in-law. He just passed the bar exam. And he's a real wholesome guy, too. Even his name, Jin-guk, means 'wholesome.' Excuse me... Are you Ms. Park Sun-young? - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening, sir! Good evening, Annie. How are you? I'm very good. How are you? Good, good. So what would you like to order? Just the normal for me, please. O K. Since my family is from Gyeongju, we'd need a bus for the wedding. It's customary for the bride's family to arrange this, no? I'd be happy to pay, of course, but according to custom... Right? You're right, of course! And a hotel would be best for me and Min-june's guests. Oh, a hotel? That's just fabulous. Don't you think, Min-june? That's right. Fabulous. That's so funny. Min-june, do you ever consult fortune tellers? Fortune tellers? I love having my fortune told! In fact there is a Taoist who we always consult for family affairs. Excuse me, I'll just visit the restroom. Oh yes, empty yourself to your heart's content. How can I escape this? How could she do this to me? What does he want at this time of day? - Hello? - Hello? Yes, sir. Where are you? In the bathroom. I'm near the office. What time is it? He calls me to ask that? My god. It's 8: 10pm. Where are you and what are you doing? I'm on an arranged date, why? Arranged what? Date! A blind date! What? What are you screaming about? Ms. June. Huh? Do I need to remind you whose idea it was to meet at the hotel bar at 7:00? God, not again. Do I look like a man who has time to spare? Hello, hello? Damn, I need to change my phone. Can't the battery last even a day? I know that place! I can't believe it. - Really? - What a coincidence! Sorry, Sun-young. I'll leave him to you. No matter how hard you try, I can still take you. No way! You think I'm still a high school boy? I'm a man now! Hey, hold it a sec. Do we really need to do this over a measly three dollars? You could've given me the cash, but you wanted to wrestle for it. You little punk! So who's calling in the dead of night? - Hello? Hello? - Give it to me, you... Hello? Why don't you say something? Hello? I'm really busy right now, if you aren't going to speak, please call me later. Sorry. You can't-just-jump in from behind! Whatever. I'm not interested in him, so you take care of it. What about the meeting of the families? Families? Hey, is he crazy or what? You're the crazy one! I've got a call. Let's talk later. Min--june! Hello? What happened to the Maeda Contract? Yes, sir. The legal department is still sorting through it. Well I want it done, before noon! Why don't you just eat me alive? Oh, that's good news. Yeah. No, I knew it was going to happen, I just didn't know it was going to happen so quickly. I didn't know he was going to cave in, right. Well, that's good work, Steven. That's very good. And send my regards to Jennifer. O K. Bye bye! I'm sorry. The report you wanted... When did you come in? Just now. Don't you ever knock?. I did. Twice, even. - Can that be true? - I'm telling you, it is. This is based on the information we have acquired to date. By the way, when will you start the real lesson, master? Are you aware that you are the person in charge of the Maeda account? Yes? Maeda Motors sought legal action to cover up their fraud over a week ago. Did you know about this? It's the first time I've heard of it. It's your first time? Then what have you been doing all week?. Do it again. Have it back to me by tomorrow. Hello. Hi, Jennifer. Hi Jennifer! Oh, Ms. Kim. How is this dress? What's the occasion? Tonight is my birthday party! I'm the guest of honor, so I need to look good. But isn't this a little too much? There'll be lots of male colleagues. Well, actually I heard this from Ms. Jeon in the legal team... Robin particularly likes big-breasted, sexy women. So I did myself up specially. Aren't I so sexy? Ha! So you finally reveal your weak point. Thanks everyone for coming to my little birthday party! Especially to the man picking up the bill, our Robin... I mean, our president. Thank you! What the hell? Mr. Heiden! Okay, then. Music? start! All right then, I'll show you the very essence of sexuality. Hello? Min--june? This is Jin-guk. How have you been? I've been fine. Hello? Hello? I can't hear you... Thank you, everyone! Care for a shot? Next is our company's hidden brain, Brian Hong! I can't sing very well... ( Love for night ( Don'tyou know my love ( Love for night Need you my love ( Love for night ( Don't you know my love ( Love! Love! Love for night ( Don 't be so lonely ( I'm here for you with smile ( Hold my hand ( and run ( It's Saturday and everybody's dancing ( in the street ( All this night, I love you ( Love for night ( Don 't you know my love Come up! Come on the stage! ( Don 't you know my love ( Love! Love! Love for night ( Hold my hand and dance with me ( Dance with fantastic rythm for us Oh my gosh, look at her! Serves her right! Not having fun? Is that what you wore on your date last night, too? What? You know, you look like a showgirl. Are you that desperate for a man's attention? That's pathetic. What do you care about what I wore on my date? Are you interested in me? I actually feel sorry for you. I was right from the beginning. It was impossible to upgrade you to a Pentium. The most lethal of all operations is the Life or Death Gamble. Today, it's either you or me, pal. Shall we make a bet to lighten the mood? Make a bet? Whoever gets drunk first, pays for tonight's bill, okay? You'll regret it. I've never lost a bet in my life. Is that so? Neither have I. Here we go! Go Mr. Heiden! You've had too much to drink. You should give up. Shut up! Oh my gosh! Did you hear that? Wow, now that I'm drunk, my pronunciation is like a native. Shut the fuck up, okay? Everybody, one shot, please. She's so drunk. Ms. June! Ms. June, what am I going to do with you? Are you O K? You want to kiss me now, don't you? But I'm never going to kiss you. Why not? Because you're so dry... You know you so dry. On top of that, you're a playboy. A playboy... You O K? I... I was... Then do you remember the president taking you home? He did? Yes. I wrote down your address for him. That's strange. My family said they heard the doorbell, and I was standing there alone. Anyway, I acquired a new respect for you last night. Especially the way you talked back to the president. Do you remember? Shut up! Shut the fuck up! O K? I said that? Really? Here's a new draft of the Maeda contract. Good. You can leave. What? Yeah. Yes. June, wait a minute. - What happened last night was... - About last night... Please forget what happened last night. It was a major mistake. Whenever I get drunk, I... I get a little crazy... Good morning... I mean, goodbye. Sir, I just spoke with someone from Maeda. Next week Chairman Mitsuyoshi will visit Korea in person. Congratulations. A mistake? Sir? Great job, June... perfect. They said I have a visitor downstairs. Not getting on? Are you O K? Oh, my god! You crazy fool, how could you not remember! Sun-young, are you crazy? Min-june! Min-june! Hey, Kim Min-june! Can it get any worse? Hey, Kim Min-june! Oh, Sun-young, here you are. I've been looking all over for you. Where are you going? Oh, an urgent meeting just popped up. Hello, Min-june... How are you? I'm sorry, but I have to go. Do you have to leave this instant? Yeah, what do I do? Oh, here comes the car. Over here! Sorry, gotta go. Sorry, Sun-young, my apologies... Over here! Bye! STOP! STOP! STOP... What's going on? Just drive on first, please. - What? - Please, I'll tell you later. I'm sorry. Well, should the two of us have lunch? What? Wait! What? Then who were you doing it with that night? It? What do you mean it? All I did that night was wrestle with my brother. Wrestling? We were hungry, so we wrestled over the takeout bill. Why are you laughing? You think it's funny that I wrestle? No, it's nothing. Don't laugh. Or share it with me, at least. Oh. Do you have any idea how cute you really are? Anyway, sorry I didn't keep the appointment that day. I thought you hadn't seen the card. And about last night... Thank you for taking me home. That looks great, doesn't it? Shall we take the ferry? I've never taken one. Never mind. It's still working hours, right? Should we go then? Really? Who's the boss? Oh, that's right. Then, shall we go? - O K - O K Goodbye, then. Women have a sort of antenna that men don't know about. According to my antenna, this man's fallen completely for my operation. But why is my heart beating so fast? Min-june! Oh... what are you doing here? I need to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. Huh? I told you, there's nothing to say. Let go. Hey! Who is this guy? Are you already seeing someone else? It's not a concern of yours. Just let her go. Tell me, do you have someone new? He's my boss. Just 30 minutes... No, 10 or even 5 minutes... Just talk with me a moment. When have I ever come for you like this? Let's go. That day, 5 minutes turned into 10, then an hour, and two hours... He said he wanted to come back to me. No. Please. Now your boyfriend is back. The lessons are over, right? I don't understand why I'm needed again. You know what all the guys I've dated said to me when we broke up? That it was all my fault. That everything was because of me. But I don't think I was wrong. And now, Jun-hyoung is telling me it was his fault. That means so much to me. See that's why you're wrong. That's your problem. When it comes to a relationship, you haven't the slightest clue. I know. You need technique, even for love. I admit it completely now. That's why I'm asking for your help. Weren't you the one with all these glorified visions of true love? One more chance! A love without losing self-respect. Self respect. Self respect. I didn't know you had any to begin with. Hey, Robin Heiden! Do you have any idea how I feel? How could you, who's never been hurt, understand me? Instead of offering your help, do you really have to crush my last bit of self-respect? This could be the end for me. This could be my last chance. So what I'm asking is... O K. I'll help you. This will be different. It will be unlike any love you had before. You think you're ready for that? If I can gain back my lost self-respect, I don't care. Robin! It's been a while. I missed you. I trust you've been well? - When did you arrive? - Just now. And who is this lovely Pocahontas? You are not cheating on me behind my back, are you? Say hello. This is Jennifer Cohen. She's a member of the U.S survey team, head of the U.S office. She is also very old friend of mine. This is June. She is an analyst here with the local team in Korea. - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too. Well... I'll just be going. Bye. Bye. Do you like her? Did you eat? Not yet. Are you taking me out? Come on. Love is a game ofpower, a manipulation of emotions. Are you ready? yes! Jun-hyoung Don 't answer it. you make him call three times. If he really wants to see you, he will call until you answer. Pay attention! You choose, he pays. You shouldn't do that. Smiles, compliments, gestures. You are only feeding his ego. One more thing. If he already has a big ego, you need to deflate it with some shock therapy. No, definitely not! Having sex with him now is like handing him the game. If you want to be treated like a queen, then act like one. How you train your opponent is up to you. - Let me do it. - Stay still, you squirt. I'll do it, Grandpa. I'll put them on you. Hello? Well anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing you next week. One week from now? Why? Do you need more time on Maeda? No, No. Should have no problems finalizing Maeda by then. O K. Good. Well, good luck with the rest ofyour pro-jects. Take care ofyourself, OK? - O K. See you soon. - See ya. Hello? Robin! Congratulations. I heard you've been appointed as managing director. Thanks! I think you've changed. What? Is that so unusual? People always change. Don't change too much. Actually, I liked the old you better. What was the 'old me' like? You were my pleasure bunny. I wish you could remain my pleasure bunny forever. He was right. I was wrong. What? I don't know a thing about love. Do you think I'm still the way I was? Huh? It's been fun. To commemorate our separation, I'll pay the bill. Bye. Hey, Kim Min-june! Huh, Kim Min-june? From now on, call me big sister! And you pay the bill! What's wrong? Trouble with your boyfriend again? I just feel confused. I guess manipulating people isn't that fun. It's tiring, and kind of hard. No pain no gain, right? I'm curious. What if, in manipulating people, we lose the pleasure of an honest conversation? Why use manipulation if we can't discover one's true feelings? Have you been happy in that sort of relationship? The funny thing is, after all that's happened, I still miss the old me. Instead of calculating, I want to be honest. Instead of receiving, I want to give. Instead of hiding, to let out all my feelings... Gosh, men are right. It's all my fault that things turned out this way. I'm really hopeless. You know, it's not your fault. They just weren't the right men for you. What? Have you ever heard someone say what you really wanted to hear? Well. You mean when I make deals? Looks like it's going to rain. We should go back to the hotel. I think I'd better just go home today. I have an umbrella in my room. I think you should take it. No, I'll leave from here. What the hell are you doing? Are you trying get yourself killed? You cross the road, you look first. You're gonna give me a heart attack. Is that what you want, huh? If you took the taxi, why is your hair so wet? What on earth is up with you? Dad, I think my head is messed up. What? Some guy completely blew up at me, but it felt like he said he loves me. He was screaming at me, but it sounded like a sweet whisper. What's wrong with me? What's wrong? You're in love with him, that's all. No, Dad. I'm not in love with him. I don't like him. Yeah? Then I guess he's in love with you. No, that can't be it, either. How do you know? Have you asked him? I haven't, but anyway it can't be true. He's too cold to me. You silly girl. Words do not always express one's feelings. Your mom says my face makes her sick, but do you believe it? You have to read the eyes! People can lie with words, but not with their eyes. - You look good. - Thank you. Yeah. Oh. Hold this, doorbell. Don't drink that, don't drink it. Hi, Pocahontas. We meet again. Hi. Did Robin invite you? I'm sorry. Please, come in. We just started. I'm just... Robin just went down to the lobby for a minute. He will be right back. Cheers to Robin, because he's going away, and we're not going to see him for a very long time. I can't believe he is leaving. He is leaving? What do you mean? Robin didn't tell you? He's been appointed to head the U.S. office. He's leaving next week. Excuse me. Sure. She's pretty cute, huh? You can't be serious. Gentlemen. - Robin. - How are you doing? I am great. How are you? Did you guys get some food? Excuse me. Jen. Don't do this right now. Do you know how humiliating this is for me to say? Is this what I've worked so hard for as the corporate spy? Please tell me how she qualifies while I don't! I don't know the what the hell are you talking about. You're not thinking of taking that woman back to the States, are you? That woman is just someone I work with, nothing else. Min-june. When did you come? A little while ago. Why are you leaving? Didn't you come to see me? I came here to tell you something. What's that? I am getting married. I wanted to tell you. It's all because of you. Thanks for your help. Go on back in. Bye. Yoon-mi, cheer up. Everything will work out. Mitsuyoshi is in Seoul to close this deal. So just be prepared. Yes sir, I see. Yes? You know Robin and I have been friends for very long time. Why are you telling me this? I've known Robin for more than 10 years. And I've been there for him when he's been sad, and when he's been happy. And you may not know this, but it's a very important time for Robin now. Has he ever told you about his first love? No. I am not interested. So I don't think you should tell me. Really? So you haven't seen his scar yet? Scar? Robin's chest. It's a bullet wound from the first woman he ever loved. What? He couldn't let her go for up to a year even though she'd left him for another man. It took a bullet wound for him to accept it. As head of the project, I would like to extend my appreciation for the agreement our two companies were able to settle. We are especially honored by Mr. Mitsuyoshi's... One second. Please, feel free to speak. You have missing out on letting us know of a very important factor in this transaction. According to this final contract, the company name will be changed. Pardon my interruption, Mr. Mitsuyoshi. But I'm simply acting on my right and my privilege as one who is buying your company. Is that so? Well, this may be a late notice. But I would like to act on my rights as the seller, too. Let's call this deal off. What are you talking about? Changing the name of the company is like changing the names of all the employees. I can't let this happen. Do you actually think there'll be another firm interested in taking over your company for the price we've offered? Are you insulting me and my company? Just a moment, please. I am sorry. Let's all calm down and take a short break, shall we? I can't believe this. How can this happen, Sir? I didn't even see this clause. I knew it would cause delays in finalizing the deal, so I put it off until today. The situation is very bad, why don't we take it out? If we take out that clause now, there is no point taking over Maeda. What's your reason? Why do we have to change the name of the company? Min-june, watch yourself! This is an extremely important issue to Japanese businessmen. It's the company my grandfather worked for... his whole life. What? The uniform in my room is my grandfather's. Wait. Please wait. I am afraid the negotiation is over. We'll get back to you next week with our decision. I understand, but... I have a story that I must tell Mr. Mitsuyoshi and everyone. Mr. Mitsuyoshi. Do you remember the uniform in that picture? That uniform is 50 years old. I'm sure you remember it, Mr. Mitsuyoshi. I am sure you remember the young men, tending to the machines wearing that uniform. One of the young men who wore that uniform has so much pride in this company and the uniform. He worked on the same job for 30 years, and even when he overworked himself to his death he never took this uniform off. When he passed away, he left this uniform behind. That's when the boy promised his grandfather that he would print the old man's name on the uniform. That grandson is waiting for all of you just outside the door. Honorable Mr. Chairman and the board of directors. Won't you please help that grandson to keep his promise? So that's what happened. However, changing the name of the company is beyond my power. But I can promise you this. I will call a board meeting regarding on this matter, and I will act on my rights as the chief executive. But you realize that this is really the responsibility for you and this lady's to persuade the Board don't you? Yes, sir! You have an excellent intuition with people. You have a great lady working for you. I can't thank you enough for helping me to keep my promise to my grandfather. I'll accept your thanks later. Nothing is certain until the contract is signed. Wait! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What? If I've ever hurt you in anyway. I am truly sorry. I sincerely mean that. You've brought me nothing but good fortune. You're more than worthy of any man's love. You're... you're more beautiful than any woman I've ever met in my life. I just... I just wanted to say that before I leave. You jerk! Since when did you start liking me? From the first day I met you. I saw that lipstick mark, and I wanted to kiss you. Really? That night, I knew it. The kind of love I had always dreamed of really exists. I am Min-june's father. You love... my... Dad, he understands Korean. Huh? - Really? - Is that so? Gosh... Son, what I want to ask is... ...Sir! Sir, do you love my daughter? Yes, sir! He said yes. So the reason you are visiting us is because you want to marry my daughter? No, it's not that. I do love Min-june, it's just that I have no intention of marrying her...just yet. He said he loves her, but he doesn't want to marry her. What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Get out! - Honey, wait! Get out, you mannerless brat! - Dad! - Didn't you come to ask...? You quit your job tomorrow!
