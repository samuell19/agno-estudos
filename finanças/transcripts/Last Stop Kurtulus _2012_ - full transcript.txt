Hello there. The new tenants have arrived. They're owners, not tenants. They purchased number 8. I think they're a young married couple. Let me see. Welcome. Thank you. Help her. There's no need. -Welcome. -Thanks. Idiot! Bang! You're shot. Volkan! Come back here. I'm sorry. He's a handful. Welcome. I hope you like it here. Thanks. I'm Gülnur, your next door neighbor. This is Volkan. And this is my daughter, Tülay. Aren't you going to say hello? -Hello. -Hello. I'm Eylem. Don't let us keep you. Don't hesitate to ask for help. Get going! Put that box over there. I'll be right back. You're a bloodsucker! You're all bloodsuckers! You live on my blood! You suck my blood dry! Look at me when I'm talking to you! Hello, Eylem. I'm Vartanuş. I live on the floor below. You haven't had a chance to shop. This'll do you for breakfast. I made it myself. Fresh from the oven. Here. Thank you. But I don't eat pastry. You've taken such trouble. In any case, I'm late. Sorry. She can eat shit! What a thing to say. -Good morning. -Good morning. Füsun, have a look. Tülay, bring us some tea. Come here. Your next door neighbor's a real snob, Gülnur. -Well, she went to college. -What'd she study? -Sociology. -No, psychology. She's a psychologist. Wasn't she married? She moved in alone. Hold on. He's her fiancé. They're not married. She's engaged? Oh, dear. Well, that's all we need around here. -Sister, come on. -You and your talk. Good morning. -Did you sleep well? -Yes. -I'm late. -Late? Are you going right away? I've got work to do. -Don't go today. -Why not? Just because. Don't go. Stay with me, okay? Or we can go out together to the cinema. Adnan, we've never been to the cinema. Take me to the cinema. Is the TV broken? -No. -So? So what? Shopping's your thing. What's all this about the cinema? Loneliness is my thing. Do know what my thing is? To have a home like everyone else. To have a kid, for example. Adnan, the years are passing. I'm getting too old. Let's get you a boob job. I know a plastic surgeon. I did some debt collection for him. He owes me one. I could talk to him. ERROR: The image is deleted by the user. The image is deleted by the user. This album is deleted by the user. Leave a message after the tone. Are you deleting our photos? Okan Poyrazlı has unfriended you. Son of a bitch! Lowlife! Rat! This building's going off the rails! Who can work in this racket? They made a real racket. I don't know if it was her fiancé, but she was fighting with a man. It must have been her fiancé. She called him a rat, see? They are reading are lips now. You've made your bed, dear. You don't put out until he gives you the ring. -You think it was easy for us back then? -Your... That's enough. People can put out whenever they want. Take it from me, that girl's in bad shape. She hasn't left the flat for a week. What does she eat and drink? We're supposed to be neighbors. We should be ashamed. She doesn't eat. She refuses pastry. -What should I do? Roast her a pheasant? -Not that. Füsun's right. Who knows what she's been through. We'll find out. Good morning. I brought some stuffed vine leaves. Thank you. With olive oil. Fresh... It's the anniversary of dad. Mr. Recep said no mourning. Mother made halvah. I don't eat halvah. I think you've got Füsun's pot. Füsun said we're holding a tenant meeting. Will you be coming alone or shall we put it off until your husband gets... Tell them to come here. -Who? -Füsun Vartanuş, your mother and the whole lot of them. There's Goncagül in number 4 and Nejat in number 5. Füsun's husband, Macit, and mother's husband, Recep. But they never attend tenant meetings. Fine. Whoever does. I'll hand round the tea then. -Thanks. -Sugar. Let me welcome you again. I hope you're both happy here. God willing. We won't be happy here because we separated. By separated, I mean he dumped me. Look. -Two weeks before the wedding... -I love you. But I'm not ready to get married. He said. I'm no child. I know firsthand about men's commitment issues. I'm a psychotherapist... Was a psychotherapist, for five years. I signed over my office in Harbiye to buy this flat. Now I'm unemployed. I was understanding. Just like my mother. We're from Manisa. Dad's a lawyer. Dad spent most of his time with whores in İzmir and mother'd be understanding. We went on vacation to stay away from gossip. Everything was great. Like we'd just met. -Until the end of the eighth day. -I need some space. He said. I know what you'll say. You're young and pretty. You've got a career. You'll easily get a man. But there are none! I got that, that and that, and everything else after he disappeared and even stopped answering my calls. None of this is my taste. I picked it all out thinking he'd like it. The result. I'm unemployed, unhappy, broke and unable to sleep. And I feel like shit. Oh, dear. Not oh, dear! Serves you right! Nobody gets what they don't deserve in this world. Isn't that so, Gülnur? Is there anything you want to know? Then stop calling me. Stop sending food. Don't worry about me. Leave me alone. -Who's that? -Eylem. Selin, if it's a bad time I won't bother you. What do you mean? Come up. They cancelled my credit card. I don't know how I'll make my house payments. I don't how I'll make any of my payments. I thought he'd wonder about me. He didn't call you, did he? No. He didn't. I'd tell you if he had, Eylem. He's not around. Sometimes I think I should move to Manisa. Think about it. It might be a good idea. Just for a while. To rest. It'll do you good. Selin, could you lend me some money? Of course. I don't know when I'll pay it back. Don't worry about it. Wait. Selin? Incoming call OKAN Hello, darling. Darling? Hello? Hello? Hello? Did you meet with him? What was his name? Okan? Look, Goncagül's engaged too. For six years. Who stays engaged for six years? Frankly, she's his mistress. He's a mafia. To top it off, he's married. He comes to screw her once a week. Excuse me. Then he pisses off, that pimp. Goncagül was a singer in the past. In a night club. He took her away from all that. What a wonderful voice, right? After my first husband died I was left with two children. If it weren't for Recep, I don't know what I'd have done. He's good at heart. You know what? He once sang with Hakkı Bulut. Take one in the evening and one in the morning. It might make you dizzy. But take it. Did Füsun give you that? Throw it out. You'll get a stroke from that. If you saw how Macit made Füsun suffer. Now he's dropped his guard. Manhood lasts till retirement. And this is my fate. A gift from my brothers. They promised he'd live with them. Here he is with me. These keep me going. I'll give you one if you like. You look worn out too. Stay strong! Just look at me. For example. I mean Ok, the guy's married with children. But who can tell? I know he loves me. How's yours? Tell me a little more. Oh, look at you. You're high, sis. Get yourself to bed. Take one an hour before bedtime, ok? It'll do you good. But don't take any tonight. Mixed with alcohol just one can do you in. I'm off. Are you alright? See you later. Lady. Lady. Fuck my luck! Hello. Send an ambulance. Suicide attempt. She's dying. Hurry. Here's the address. A revolt against the cost of living, unemployment and corruption. The streets have filled with angry protestors. The uprising has led to bloodshed in Tunisia Dozens have died in the violence. Thousands gathered in front of the Tunisian Home Office. Gunshots have broken out. Widespread violence was triggered by the death of a youth who set himself ablaze to protest the police. According to official sources, at least 20 people have died. Human rights organizations put the figure at 70. I hope you're feeling better. Good God. Bless that thief. Someone's watching over you. GREEK UPRISING WHO WILL PAY FOR THE CRISIS? Tensions are running high. After a brief hearing, the chief judge passed sentence. Penal servitude for life. Okay. How does dying help you? I'd die if it helped. I get beaten all the time. Life's funny. Eylem, let me ask you something. Think it over before you answer. The guy Goncagül's with is married with two kids. Do you think he'll divorce his wife and marry her? I don't. I've told Goncagül so many times. That man's trouble, I tell her. Homewreckers never get a home. Don't be alarmed. Flat number 5. Nejat. Goncagül nodded off and I took over. Thank you. Now if you'll allow me, I'll get up. Go for it, get up. I'll leave when I finish my drink. Mr. Nejat. So you got the women fooled. I say it's a fake suicide, but they won't believe me. We can discuss it when you're sober. Would you leave now? A day I'm sober. That day will never come. Even that hour won't. I'm an alcoholic. What do you mean, took over. Is this a train station? -Isn't what you wanted? -What? You wanted attention, therapist girl. Now you've got it. Your life story moved us all. And that death scene, fantastic! Dying all in white. Ew. You've got to admit it was pretty cheesy stuff. The wedding dress was completely coincidental. Why did he dump you? Ok, you look like shit, but that's cause you're depressed. Normally you're good in the sack. So that's what you're after! Get out or I'll scream! You told everyone openly. You said you couldn't get over him. You've got nothing to worry about. Even if you dance on it I can't get it up. Relax. I stole your wedding gown. It's public property now. Now it's Saadet Apartment's flag, coyly waving in the breeze. Scared? Didn't you want to die? Come on, let's die together. -Clown! -I'm serious. Really. Come on. Idiot! Get lost! Look me in the face! Whore! You're all a bunch of parasites! Damn you all! -What is it? -Sorry to disturb you. I'd like to speak to Gülnur. Gülnur is asleep. Could you wake her? No, I can't. How could I? She never wakes up. Say Eylem's sick and she will. Go find yourself another door. What's your problem? There's a family here, ok? Children. Eylem, what's going on? Stop it. What happened? Nothing. I just want to see Gülnur. Look, we haven't even met. Eylem, was it? -That's right. -We'd have met somehow. They say you're depressed. It can happen. But you can't disturb other people. Yes. You're right, Recep. We're sorry. Now go on inside. Eylem, come here. What's wrong with you people? He tortures her in front of you every single day! Hey! Watch your mouth! -Who do you think you are? -Eylem, don't! Are you looking for trouble? Go inside, go! Look here, Eylem. I'm an artist. Fuck your art. I might come home a little late. Sorry, ladies. I apologize. I shouted a bit but I mean, we might have been noisy in bed. Eylem's a single woman. -I'm calling the police. -Recep. Eylem, that's enough! Go on, Recep. For God's sake, I'm trembling. Go, get inside. Eylem, I know both Mr. Recep and Mrs. Gülnur. They squabble sometimes. Everyone does. I spoke to her and she's not filing a complaint. Well, I am. She gets beaten every day. You called and I arrived as a police officer of the state. I spoke with her. I also spoke with her spouse. I want to talk to him too. At this time? He doesn't want you in his house. -Will you use force? -Watch the way you talk to me! This flat was broken into. Why didn't you call? -He didn't steal. -Did you know him? Excuse me? You're protecting him! A thief who broke in. I wasn't well. Fine, see a doctor. Is that a police's job? Disturbing the peace is also cause for complaint. Don't go calling the police for no reason. I told him to bet. And the horse lost. -Commissioner. -Go ahead, I'm coming. -Come by the coffeehouse tonight. -Ok. Eylem? Come here for a second. I'm busy. I can't come right now. Did Füsun tell you to bring those up? No. I did it myself. Thank you. I'll put them over here. Have you got time to help? Come here. Take this, would you? You should have got egg cartons. They're better at soundproofing. -Why do you always get involved? -I wanted to help. Some help you were. Thanks a lot. At least he never touched me. Thanks to you, he did! -That animal! How... -Animal or not, what's it to you? Mind your own business. You came here and bothered everyone. You can't help yourself but you're trying to save us. -I wanted to protect your mother. -It was the noise that disturbed you. You're a psycho. Crazy! I wish you'd died! Tülay. Tülay, sweetie. Mother's going to kill Recep. It's no joke. No she won't, Tülay. She said it in anger. She didn't say anything. She's sending me to my uncles'. Read it if you don't believe me. She gave it to Volkan, because she knew I'd read it. She's entrusting us to our uncles. Mother went mad after he hit me. She's turned into somebody else. This isn't a movie. It's real. I can see that. And nobody does a thing. If this happened out front, what would you do? I really don't know. It makes my head hurt. Ah, Eylem. Why do you watch this stuff? You're already a nervous wreck. Exactly! Why did you show it to us, anyway? Are you a nutcase? Are you mental? And you're supposed to be a therapist. First go and treat yourself. Don't do stuff like this. Watch more uplifting things. At least consider it. My blood pressure's gone through the roof. Okay, Füsun. We'll all watch soap operas. Then wake up with anti-depressants and sleep with pills. Now and then we'll get beaten and tortured dragged by the hair and get raped. We'll let men batter the world. But here in Saadet Apartment building, we'll all think happy thoughts. Damn that Okan or whatever his name is. The girl's gone mad! You're right, Vartanuş. I've turned into somebody else. If you knew what's been running through my head, you'd be scared of me. You want him to die, right? I don't want him to die, I want to kill him. Normally I couldn't kill a cockroach. We all have a dark, savage side. But surrendering to those impulses has only ever benefitted the strong, bullies, men. Violence begets violence. And we end up on the losing side. Gülnur, what do you say? They might shut you away for life. I don't know your relatives, but your children would grow up orphans. You'd end up as a tiny article on the 3rd page. When oppressed wives read it, they'd think themselves lucky and become even more servile. What's she going on about, talking in riddles all the time? Gülnur? What's she saying? Damn you! Sit down, Gülnur. If Recep's police friend gets his hands on this letter you'll serve a life sentence! "A monster woke up inside me I didn't know existed. I'm determined to punish him with my own hands. All I ask is that you look after my children and do all you can for them. You all helped me in my time of need. If it weren't for you I might not be alive right now. Do you know our biggest weakness? We don't realize our own strength. What strength? For God's sake, what strength? They've got the money. You saw it, the police are on their side. If you complain, you get smacked and sit on your ass. Alone, we're weak. That's true. If we resort to violence, we're weak. But if we join forces... Wonderful. Words like honey. Congratulations. We'll join forces and stick together. Let's raise our flag over in the square. And then? Some money and a divorce is the only way out of this. Otherwise, Gülnur will be right back in that house with Recep. Alone with him at night. No she won't! Gülnur won't be alone with Recep! We'll all be there when he comes home! But not all grim and angry! Not to pick a fight. Celebrating. Like a welcoming. I'm not sure. Let's try. What have we got to lose? Are we going to just sit back and watch this horror film unfold? What makes men like Recep strong? Our fear of them. Why are we scared? Not because we get beaten. Can he kill us? Hardly. Can he throw us out? There's a law against that. Let's say he does. The house. I can sign a paper saying I've received two years' rent. If the bank forecloses, they can't kick you out. Selling lemons would cover the kids' expenses. What is it Füsun? What's that look? Nothing. I mean you're absolutely right. I'm listening. The second a woman becomes weak and powerless, they tear her to shreds, body and soul. You get used to it. You think that's how it goes. Where have you been? Put these in vases. I'll finish up the soup. Look, plant water leaked on me. Hurry up. Recep will be here soon. Come on. -Okay, we're ready. -Remember. We're not afraid! Not ashamed! Not hiding! We're beaten. We're humiliated. We're cheated on. But we're not alone. Bring it on! Everybody will see, hear and know! Life's on our side. Compassion's on our side. -Children are on our side. -He's coming. Go on. Over there. -What do we do? -Sit down. What's all this? -Welcome, Recep. -Welcome, Mr. Recep. Come right in. Welcome, Recep. We've prepared your favorite dishes. -Let me take your jacket. -You must be exhausted. Go right in. Welcome, Mr. Recep. Recep, Eylem made you soup. Tripe soup no less. I need a word with you. Didn't you hear me? Get over here. Let's talk in the bedroom. -Don't leave her alone. -We said we'd stick together. Fucking bitch! Great idea, Eylem. We all got battered together! But we didn't submit! We resisted! Eylem! I'm sticking with you from now on. I feel reborn! Wasn't that great? He fell pretty hard! He might have broken bones. We said no to violence, but he attacked us like a bear. That pink scarf looks great on him. My nerves are shot. Look here. He's in bad shape. I can't find a pulse. Better call an ambulance. Gülnur, shall we call an ambulance? I think he's had a turn for the worse. -Recep. -Recep. Never mind that ambulance. You'll need a hearse. Oh, my God! Recep! Damn you all! You killed my mountain of a man! Cut it out. You'd kill him yourself. You shouldn't have burned that letter, Eylem! We're murderers! What makes us murderers? This imp killed her stepdad! She had one end of the scarf. Everyone saw it. -The truth is you both strangled him! -I'll tear out your tongue. Aren't you the one who dive-bombed his head? I'm not rotting in jail because of you. Eylem went bananas on him! Am I the one who kicked him in the balls, Goncagül? No violence, I told you! We weren't going to use violence! Let's call the police. We have no choice. We're murderers. May those to blame be struck blind! I know I'm to blame. Gülnur, say I was the instigator. You've got children. You'll get off more lightly. Good idea. A brilliant idea. And it's true. Come on. Get going, Vartanuş. Go then. But I know what I'm telling the police. -And what will that be, dear? -That we formed a gang. That we trained. That we executed him. I'm a minor. You decide what you'll tell the police. -I'm calling the police. -No, don't. We're listening, Tülay. What do you suggest? Keeps your mouth shut and nobody goes to jail. What about this? The well in the courtyard will do. Plop! Before dawn. Be careful! Grab tight. Grab him by the head. He's falling! Careful, girl! Almost there. Lower him. Slowly. Hold the flashlight. Be careful. I think I got a hernia. Slowly. Slowly. Incoming Call OKAN Get going. What time is it? It's early. Go to sleep. Everything alright? Sure. Recep never came. A sudden gig. He went on tour. He just called Gülnur. We waited for nothing. Good night. Tülay, do you want me to stay? If you want. You might be scared alone. I'm worried about you. About me? I'll sleep just fine for the first time in this house. Good night. -Did you have a bad dream too? -Why don't you leave me alone? Macit just tried to kill himself. What? You've started a trend. He was about to jump into the well. Then he backed down. I might have imagined it. Alcohol. Sometimes I see bugs everywhere at home. I can help you give up. -Give up what? -Drinking. The bugs and all. That's not a good sign. Here. -I didn't know you were a writer. -I'm not. You'll see when you read it. I will read it. Godspeed. Where is everybody? Welcome. Where's Recep? Recep's on tour in Adana. They telephoned him. He rushed off to Adana. -A tour in Adana? -Yes, a tour in Adana. Why didn't he call me? -Was he going to call? -Don't you know my boy, Recep? He wouldn't go off to Adana without calling me. He'd want some names from the force. Someone to clean up after him when he fucks up. That's weird. Off on tour in Adana. Recep, what are you doing? What's all this about a tour? What are you up to this time? Up to? What's he saying? Nothing. He declined the call. Recep's with a whore and you cover up for him. What are you talking about? Füsun told me. Gülnur told her. Gülnur told Füsun. And Füsun told me. That's all I know. Who is it? Spill the beans. Hüseyin, what do I know? Am I in charge of his dick? Let's find a fourth player. Otherwise I'm leaving. Ok, alright then. Sabri will join us. Speaking of women, how's the psychologist doing? How do I know, Hüseyin? I've got better things to do. I don't. Wind her up so she calls the police. Next time I'll take her statement alone. -What's so funny? -Sorry. What about touching up the roots? I'll do your roots later, Müzeyyen. Alright? -I want a perm. -Look, come back later. -We're busy. Good bye. -Tomorrow. Good bye. It's easy to say not to panic. We all know Macit. He's always running his mouth off. Macit, still? Aren't you listening to me? I told you, Macit slept like a log until morning. If anyone saw anything, it's Nejat. He was up on the roof, drunk. That prick! Nejat didn't see anything. And he wouldn't tell if he did. -What? -Nothing. I made the halvah without nuts. We ran out. She's got a screw loose. Are you out of your mind? We bend over backwards so nobody would see or understand anything. And now you bring us some funeral halvah? God help you. What else can I say? Cool it, Füsun. She's also a nervous wreck. What about the rest of us? And why did all this happen? Because of who? You'd think we were never beaten in our lives. Look, you little bitch! Don't smirk at me. I'll scratch your eyes out. -What did you say to my daughter? -What did I say? Isn't it the truth? Isn't it all because of her? -Füsun! -What? -Take that back! -No. -Füsun, take that back. -And if I don't? Füsun, take that back or I'll smash your mouth in. -Füsun, what are you doing? -Stay out of it! -What's it to you? -Okay, kill each other. Go on. Are you out of your minds? Actually, I'm terrified. But not of the police or jail. -Of what then? -Don't laugh. He wasn't buried. There wasn't a funeral. I'm scared he'll haunt me one night. You're right. We hadn't thought of that. Gülnur, I'm sorry. I didn't think. If you trust me, I can handle it. But calm down first. Don't mind us. We've been neighbors for years. Don't worry. Füsun, darling. Is this a good day for a picnic? What's wrong with it? It's a nice day. Keep driving. I already am. This is Mr. Recep. Take your time. Look at him. Touch him if you want. Slow movements. Nothing fast or jerky. Volkan. Come here my boy. Have a seat. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Like this. Don't let it go out, okay? I'll be right back. Keep fanning it. Good boy. You made me suffer, Recep. God is my witness. Slowly. Very slow movements. We're all witnesses. You were a real sadist. You made us all suffer. Those songs of yours? Tülay. Aren't you going to say something? Don't go down the well. Don't scare off the ducks. God forbid! Shame on you. Uncle Macit! Why are you sneaking up on me? -The fire went out. -Let's go light it. Don't look, don't look, move along. I didn't like you one bit, Recep. But nobody deserves to be killed. Your death was an accident. Forgive me for being part of that accident. We brought you here to rest in peace. And we forgive you too. Where are they? The coal will die out. Wait. Sorry to bother you. Where's Recep? It's been weeks. Are you asking me? Who should I ask? You're his wife, aren't you? Don't be so sure! Ask him if you see him. He could at least call. It's shameful. Who'd do this? Recep's not that kind of man. Maybe something happened to him. -Aren't there any police in Adana? -I asked. There's no trace of him. How could there be? I didn't believe for a second that he went to Adana. Alright. Hang on. I'll ask at headquarters. You do that. Hüseyin. Thank God you're here. Still nothing from my dad. Mother's upset but she hides it. She keeps saying that he's abandoned us for another woman. How could that be? I wouldn't care either way. But mother loves him for some reason. She secretly cries at night. Comfort your mother. Recep's a good man. I'll find him. Okay? Where were you? My fingers are shriveled up. Well, I'm here now. -You wouldn't believe what happened. -Don't tell me anything. Not now. Adnan's taking me out tonight. He's got something special to say. What could be special? -A wedding? -Bite your tongue. -That could be it. -I hope so. -Enough. -Where were you last night? -I stayed at a friend's. -You... -Gülnur! -Shame on you! I can't control her. She's like a genie let out of the bottle. She's gone wild. -But... -We were to go on like normal, right? Wouldn't anyone looking at her ask where her pimp of a father was? They already have. Guess who just visited! Who? Yes, Okan? I'm fine. Just fine. And you? -I'm not fine at all, Eylem. -Why not? Work's terrible. We checked dad into the hospital. -My sympathies. -Thanks. Eylem I feel guilty. I know I treated you unfairly. -How's Selin? -I'm not seeing her. Could we meet? I miss you a lot. I know you're angry with me. No, Okan, I'm not angry. And I don't miss you. But if you want to meet, let's meet. You can bring the house keys. I'll bring them. God. My hands are shaking. I didn't think I'd be so nervous. I'll call you. Kisses. Fuck your kisses, you bastard. His hands are shaking. You hear that? Don't be hard on him. Eylem, aren't you excited at all? Not at all. FORGIVE ME LITTLE BIRDY -Goncagül? What happened? -Eylem. -What happened, Goncagül? Tell me. -Eylem, we went to dinner. We went out to dinner, Eylem. Stay in the flat as long as you want. I don't expect a rent. I'll put money in your account until you find a job. Speaking of a job, remember that surgeon I told you about? For your boobs. He's looking for a secretary. He could give you a tune-up too. It's him. -Answer it. See what he says. -Don't answer. -Answer it. -Steady, Goncagül. Yes? Okay. Alright. He's coming here. -You guys come too. -What? What's with the looks? Where are your pink scarves? Mine's clean. I ironed it. Do we need flowers? Let's all greet him together. Let's hear him. Goncagül. Have him come here. This is your home too. If you want to be alone, I'll scram. But just you and me. You don't get it. I'm not scared. I get it perfectly. So does everyone else. Get it out of your head. You're still hurting, but I'll say it. You knew it would end like this, didn't you? Ask yourself. I knew. It's no surprise. It's not the end of the world. It's the start of a new life. You're not alone. Believe me. You might laugh about this one day. The day you were set free. We choose life, not death, Goncagül. Never forget that. We're not going to forgive. We're going to get revenge! But not by being destructive. By loving ourselves and leading good lives. Okay? You can tell him not to come. He's here. Have him come up here. Everyone else, leave. No. Stay. I'll handle it myself. You go sleep. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. What can he say? He's not worth my spit. Coffee? Here she is. Sweet as can be. Bring it over, dear. Are you a genie or what? You could sweet talk a snake out of its hole! Unbelievable. Shit! Oh shit! He killed her! Shit, shit. He felt bad for me. After all these years. He couldn't stand it. Let me do you one last time, he said. Come on. -What happened? -Open up. -What's the matter? -The matter? Gunshots came from your building. They called the station. Gun? Shots of a gun? Go on, have a look inside. What's wrong with you? I can't find the gun. Could it be over there? Don't make a peep. Turn off the lights. -Don't move! -Police! -Police! Police! -We get it, police. Stop yelling. -Up against the wall. Drop the gun! -You get up against the wall. Chief, do something. What's he, a rookie? Are you a rookie, buddy? Okay, calm down. Listen to your chief. Calm down. -Okay, calm down. -What's the problem? -It's okay. -I fired off a couple shots. -Search him. -I'll pay the fine. Stop it! Don't touch me! Stop it! If we're going to the station, let's go. Hüseyin, what happened? I was terrified. It's nothing. Go to bed. Good night. Chief, we found three shells inside. -Alright, take him away. -Get going. Get going my ass. He says get going! 4532, the suspect's been found. We're bringing him in. Nejat's back. Hold on. Wait here. I told them I found the gun. They didn't buy it. I confessed everything. Recep told me to hide it for him. It was unlicensed. He had kids in the house. They bought that. Nejat. Come over. That's it. Nice. Everyone's in good spirits I see. We sure are. Don't worry, Eylem. We arranged everything. Tülay, tell her. She'll feel better. Foremen are filling the well with cement tomorrow. The courtyard's becoming a garden. Eylem, Recep hasn't been around for ages. -Well, he is an artiste. -That's right. Everyone saw me leave the restaurant. I drove his car back to his workplace in the dark of night. I'm clean. Don't worry. It's all over now. What do you have to say for all these? We're meeting at my place tonight. Put on something nice for a change. Just do what I tell you. Don't worry about the cost. Get her whatever car she wants. For God's sake! I'm fine. What do you mean? I couldn't be better. Look, son, she's your one and only wife. Get it for her. This one's on me, girls. Cheers, cheers. I'll get it. The meatballs are great. Where have you been? Grab a seat. -Where have you been? -Come on over. I had a thing. Just got home. I heard the noise and thought I'd take a look. Listen, we're also crying in the inside but we're trying to act normal. You should too. Don't let on. This is my day of salvation. We're celebrating. -Right, sister? -Come on. Check her out. Enough! You've all gone mad! You haven't understood a word I've said. When you're done having fun, come up to my place. Understood? You didn't miss me at all? Screw the roof, the foundation and the plaster of this damn building! -Here it goes! -Come on. Hold tight. What's going on? Drop him! -4560, police station. -We read you. Last stop in Kurtuluş. Saadet Apartment. Send a squad. Don't move. Attention all squads. Last stop in Kurtuluş, Saadet Apartment. Now we're fucked. The squads are on their way. Answer, 4560. 4560. Do you read me, 4560? Attention all squads. 4560 has been cut off. Leave him to me. You can all go. I'm not going anywhere. If my daughter's staying, so am I. Let them come and get us. OFFICER HAS BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE TERRORISTS HOLD AN OFFICER HOSTAGE We're live at the last stop in Kurtuluş. It's just been confirmed that a policeman has been taken hostage. But his identity has not yet been revealed. It's not known how many there are. We've received reports that militants were preparing an armed assault when an operation was underway. The Chief of Police has arrived at the scene. Could you please tell us what's happening? Chief, care for an explanation, sir? A new terrorist organization? Our intelligence unit has been successful. As you see, the area is under control. We've told them to surrender. We expect results imminently. There are reports of a women's organization and that they're preparing to take action all across the country. Can you confirm these reports? I ask the members of the press to refrain from speculation. This is an isolated incident. It will be resolved shortly. That's all. -Are you in contact? -Yes. Saadet Apartment, we'd like to establish contact. Can you hear me? My name is Tamer Cansu. I'm a psychologist. I'm here to help the security forces. Who am I talking to? Eylem. I'm speaking on behalf of the women of the resistance. End the barricade. Eylem, we've identified you. You don't have a criminal record or ties. You're acting foolishly. The security forces could launch an operation at any moment. That's up to them. They'd kill our hostages as well as us. Hostages? Did you say hostages? We know you're holding a police officer. We're also holding two other men. Eylem, listen. The state won't negotiate. You have two alternatives. Either come out or they'll come up and remove you. I was barely able to persuade them for this talk. Let them come and get us. They'll have to answer for it. They're not taking us seriously. We noticed. They'll be out in 15 minutes. I'm warming up. -Go to the window and talk to them. -In your dreams. Untie me and you won't get hurt. Eylem. Come here and hear me out. Watch me resolve this. -I'll be right back. -Okay, Vartanuş. Such a pity. But he asked for it. What? Don't worry. Good cop, bad cop. They'll be out in 15 minutes. Don't worry. Let's keep using the same tactic. All right ladies. I'm ready. Let me get this nice and ready. Be careful. You'll cut your hand. Am I supposed to do this alone? Help me. Let's do it. -Tülay. -Come here, Goncagül. Get ready, we're starting. -Yes. -Yes. -What are you doing? -What do you think? Are you going to talk? Look, up there! Move back. They're armed to the teeth, sir! They've got hostages. Move back! Send away the shrink. Bring in the special team. Okay? A clear target. We're waiting for your orders to shoot. Are they armed? They're serving tea, chief. Revolution! Freedom! Turn them back! Nicely! Down with the fathers! Down with the husbands! Down with the state! Down with the truncheons! Revolution! We continue live at the last stop in Kurtuluş. Things have come to a head. A group of women supporting the resistance are demonstrating at the scene. For a country like Turkey, where women are killed like mosquitos it's a small crowd. We're going over to them. Long live female solidarity! Why are you here? Why don't you ask the women who haven't come? Why aren't other women here? Why aren't all the women of Turkey here? Don't they see what's happening? Tülay, what are you doing over there? I'm looking at the messages of solidarity. How'd they hear about this? On TV. And on my blog, of course! What's a blog? Good God! They're going to slaughter us, I tell you. They can't do a thing. Good for you. Let me translate that into English. The female protestors are rushing the police barricades. We're live at the last stop in Kurtuluş. Things are spinning out of control. In a moment we'll be interviewing Eylem Soyluer. We've accessed the militant's HQ. They have agreed to talk to us. Eylem Soyluer, last stop in Kurtuluş, Saadet Apartment is the spokesperson for the resistance. She'll be answering my questions in a moment. How did these women unite? What were their intentions? Eylem Soyluer will tell us. We women are resisting male violence. The police entered my home without a search warrant. Now they've surrounded my home and are pointing their guns at us. They say we can't defy the state. Well, where was the state when women all across the country were beaten, stabbed and shot? What do you mean the area is under control? What area? Aren't you watching the TV? Don't piss me off. This is no joke. It's playing with fire. The whole country's revolted! What's the Women's Liberation Movement? The women in front of Saadet Apartment continue to raise their voices. They told us to ask the police why they were there. We added another question. What do the policemen's wives think about this? And now... What's all this about? Attention, attention. I'm giving you 10 minutes to surrender to the security forces. Come out one-by-one, hands on your heads. Otherwise I'll be forced to start an operation. This is your last warning. Wait. Sit. Be careful, Eylem. The TV went out. I don't want to go to jail. Come on then. Come on. We've come to the end of a 16-hour operation. It's just been confirmed that Saadet Apartment has been brought under control. With one exception. An insurgent and a hostage are still at large. Shout so everyone hears! End male violence! Are you ready? No. Dear viewers we present a subject that's been debated for months. Everyone has taken sides on this issue. Some were enraged, some moved to tears. Some of us continue to ponder the implications. How did a drama in a tiny flat transfix the entire nation? Here's a brief summary of Last Stop in Kurtuluş. In five years of marriage, I was beaten daily. I put up with it for the sake of the children. One day I rebelled because he hit my daughter. That's right. I told him to keep his hands off her. And he left. Now they ask where my husband is. -The well's clean. -In unity is strength. Everyone knows that saying. But Eylem proved it was true. That's why she's in prison. Why? She electrocuted her fiancé. What next! The guy was clumsy. He dumped her. He broke up with her. What business did he have in her house, in a bubble bath no less? Still, may he rest in peace. May he rest in peace and may Eylem be released. And stop smearing us. All this talk about us being a terrorist organization. We're no such thing. Come see for yourself. Women work here, and so do men. We don't discriminate. That's right. FREEDOM TO EYLEM SOYLUER We might be able to help you. But it depends on you. If you believe in yourself and you've got courage. We're guilty. We're wrong. We're at fault. First they make us believe that. So we bow our heads and we resign ourselves to faith. We have it coming. No. We choose life, not death. Never forget you're not alone. We have the strength to reclaim our stolen lives. We won't forgive. We'll get revenge. But not through destruction. By loving ourselves and leading good lives. Eylem, you have a visitor. Listen, Seher. We haven't got much time. Know this first. We oppose all forms of violence. -What a wonderful song. -Thank you. Did you really like it? -Yes. -It's my favorite song on my album, which is being released soon. I'd like to dedicate this song to Eylem Soyluer. I'd also like everyone to know that I'm donating all the proceeds from the album to the Eylem Soyluer Freedom Campaign. Is there anything you'd like to say to Eylem? Eylem, we love you. And we know you'll be with us soon. That's all. And kisses. We all love her so much.
