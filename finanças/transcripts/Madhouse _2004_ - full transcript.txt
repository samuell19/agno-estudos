OH, I FOLLOWED THE LITTLE BOY-- THE KID I KEEP SEEING RUNNING AROUND HERE. HE BROKE INTO MY ROOM EARLIER. I JUST CHASED HIM DOWN TO SEE WHO HE WAS. IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE THAT HE RUNS AROUND HERE AT NIGHT. I GUESS THE WHOLE PLACE IS A LITTLE STRANGE. OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD. I GUESS SO. HEY...THAT NOISE I KEEP HEARING-- WHAT IS THAT? I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COMES FROM DOWN IN THE BASEMENT, AND I FIGURED IT WAS THE WATER PIPES. MAYBE. WELL...WHAT IS IT? IT'S AN OLD BUILDING. IT COULD BEA VARIETY OF THINGS. BUT? BUILDINGSARE LIKE PEOPLE. THEY REMEMBEREVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO THEMTHROUGHOUT TIME. SOMETIMES... THEY DON'T LIKEWHAT THEY REMEMBER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? A WHILE BACK... WE HAD A PATIENTDOWN IN CELL 44. HE WAS THE SADDEST,SICKEST SUBJECT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS. ONE NIGHT,HE DUG HIMSELF OUT, BUT HE GOT TURNED AROUNDAND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY. AND WHAT HAPPENED? HE JUMPED OUTA THIRD-STORY WINDOW. DID HE DIE? SOME SAY HE DIEDWHEN HE HIT THE GROUND. SOME SAY THEY CAUGHT HIMAND LOCKED HIM BACK UP. BUT I... I BELIEVEHE'S STILL HERE... DESPERATELY TRYING TO DIGHIS WAY OUT AND GO HOME. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT? EITHER THAT, OR HECAME BACK TO RUN THIS PLACE. MR. STEVENS, I HAVE A WETCLEANUP IN THE TELEVISION ROOM.

SOME OF THE PATIENTS HOUSED HERE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY REMINDED WHO HAS THE UPPER HAND. YES, BUT IHARDLY THINK THAT REFUSING TO TAKEYOUR MEDICATION WARRANTSAN ELECTRICAL BURN. STEVENS-- THIS PLACE IS A MESS.IT'S DIRTY. IT'S UNSAFE.IT'S UNDERSTAFFED. ARE YOU AWARETHAT THERE ARE CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND HEREAT NIGHT? NO ONE GETS IN OR OUT OF THIS BUILDING WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. WHAT ABOUT THE PATIENTWHO ESCAPED FROM THE BASEMENT? DR. MORTONTOLD ME ABOUT... A PATIENT WHO ESCAPEDFROM THE BASEMENT. DR. MORTON DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. LOOK...LET'S START OVER AGAIN, ALL RIGHT? WHILE IT'S NO SECRET THIS PLACE COULD USE A LITTLE FIXING UP, MOST OF THE PATIENTS HOUSED HERE ARE CONTENT. YOU KNOW WHY? THEY HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. YOU STICK TO THE RULES, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, AND I'LL CONSIDER SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS YOU PUT TOGETHER. ARE WE IN AGREEMENT,MR.

I THOUGHT I WAS BEGINNING TO HEAR THINGS. NOW YOU KNOWWHAT MADNESS FEELS LIKE. THAT'S A FEELINGYOU'LL NEVER FORGET. WHY ARE YOU SITTING OVER THERE IN THE DARK? ILLUMINATION ONLY REMINDS MEOF WHAT I'VE BECOME. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? THAT'S A SUBJECTIVEQUESTION. THERE WAS A PROBLEM DOWN HERE LAST NIGHT.

Clark: WHAT'S THAT? TAKING WHAT THE PATIENTSSAY TOO SERIOUSLY. I'M NOT. BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT. LOOK, I DID HEAR HENDRICKS AND FRANKS ARGUING THE NIGHT SHE GOT KILLED. CLARK, YOUHAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PATIENTSARE TOTALLY DELUSIONAL. THEY'LL TELL YOU THINGS, THINGS THEY ACTUALLYBELIEVE TO BE TRUE. BUT HARD-CORE SCHIZOPHRENICS,IN PARTICULAR, CAN'T BE TRUSTED,YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE TO TAKEWHAT THEY SAY WITH A GRAINOF SALT. I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT JUST SEEMED WEIRD. HE WAS BEING REALLY CRYPTIC. LOOK...THEY'RE PARANOID. I'M SURE THEY HAVE ITOUT FOR FRANKS BECAUSE HE'S THE ONEKEEPING THEM LOCKED IN HERE. I THINK YOU'REREADING TOO MUCH INTO THIS CONVERSATION. YOU CAN NEVER REALLYTRUST A SCHIZO. ALL RIGHT. WHY ARE ALL THE PATIENTS IN THE BASEMENT ON THE SAME MEDICATION? BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY'RE KEEPING THEMSERIOUSLY TRANQUILIZED. I USED TO LOVE TO PLAYOUTSIDE THIS TIME OF DAY. ME AND MY FRIENDS,WE'D PLAY KICK-THE-CAN... SOMETIMES DODGE BALL. I WASN'T REALLYGOOD AT THAT ONE. TOO AFRAID OF GETTING HITBY THE BALL, I GUESS. AND ONE DAY, THINGSJUST STARTED TO GO BAD. HOW SO? I STARTED SEEING STUFF... KNOWING STUFFBEFORE IT HAPPENED. ONE DAY MY PARENTSDROPPED ME OFF HERE TO HAVE SOME TESTSRUN, AND... THEY NEVER CAME BACK. THAT'S A REALLY ROUGH THING TO CARRY AROUND WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN TRY YOUR BESTTO STEER LIFE IN THE DIRECTIONYOU WANT IT TO GO IN, BUT... EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCHHAPPENS AS IT'S MEANT TO BE. MAYBE SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT THE DAYI LEAVE HERE WILL BE THE DAYTHAT I'M DEAD. SEE, THAT'S...THAT'S ONE OF THE BAD THINGS ABOUT KNOWING STUFFBEFORE IT HAPPENS. MY LITTLE PROBLEM... STEMS FROM THE FACT... THAT I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER CHILD. I'M A VULNERABLE CHILD TRAPPED INSIDE AN ADULT'S BODY. AND WEARINGAN ADULT DIAPER. [LAUGHTER] UP YOURS, JIMMY! OK, OK. CALM DOWN. LOOK, WE'RE ALL GRIEVING RIGHT NOW, AND SOME OF US FEEL VULNERABLE...
