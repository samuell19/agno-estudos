Shit. Put it on. I'll be there around 7.30. And start it. It's OK? I'll be there. How's the other patient? You explain the situation to her. Here, puss. There you are. - Hi. - It's begun. - Hi, OK? - Hi. Yeah. OK. - And then after the 30th... - On the 30th. OK. - Shall we test the mike? - Yes. Another ten seconds. - Patricia introduces you and we move on to questions. - All right. - Three, two, one... - France Culture... The spirit of openness. Live from Moscow, we welcome Dimitri Vasiliev, the controversial director who opens the season at the Paris Opera with The Snow Maiden by Rimsky-Korsakov. Dmitri Vasiliev, hello. Good morning. You are known for your very political stagings. You suffer the wrath of power. Are you going to restrain yourself... ...so as not to offend the reputedly conservative Parisian public? No no not at all. France is the country of revolution, of new things. I believe it will go well. I've always dreamed to stage in Paris. This city has a special place in my heart. - Good evening. Two people? - Yes. Next week, another subject altogether. An aeronautical congress. - I have aviation terms to learn. - What type? The type? What does that mean? "The focus of nanostructured materials." Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me a minute. Yes. OK. All right. Alright. Yeah. Fuck! You startled me. OK? Sorry, I have to go back. - To work? - Yeah, the new intern... She understands nothing. She's new, so...? Sorry. - Are you on duty? - No, but it's my department. - What are you going to do? - Well... I don't know. - You're coming home? - Yes. See you later. I won't be long. I'll call you. Good luck. See you later. I'm just stopping for a drink. Sorry, the table's reserved. Try the other room. - That way? - Yes. Excuse me, is the other room this way? Yeah, right through there. Thanks. Good evening! - That free there? - Sure, have a seat. Here you go... The croque-monsieur. No, it's... What happened afterwards? Everything faded from my memory. The scar should stabilize before we operate. You can get dressed. It's safely closed up, is it? I'd love to get on with things. It'll better for surgery in seven months. It's too inflammatory now. In seven months? All right. But you can still... ...make it disappear? We'll do what we can, but we're not magicians. - Haven't you returned to work yet? - No. Not yet, but soon, I... I've been at my mum's country house. It's good to come back. Ladies and gentlemen, due to works, we are forced to make a detour. Driver, can you open the door please? The toilets are here. I'm not looking for the toilet. OK, I see. Contact the association that organizes visits Monday mornings. It's for those people... People like you. Like me? The victims who need to review the premises. I don't know, they talk... We're closed during that time. It's a service... I can't... You understand? You want a coffee? Yes thanks. This is on me, Ma'am. Did you stay very long with your mother? Three months... yeah. I wrote to you... You didn't get back to me. I imagine you mightn't want to talk about it. Obviously I won't ask you for details. It's not easy to know what to talk to you about. Can you bring the cake? Yes of course. - You OK? - I'm OK. Yep I'm fine. I take the... - Champagne glasses. - All right. See you in a minute. Are you okay, sweetie? - So here you are. - Hi... Just taking a little break. In the dark? - I'm near some bottles. - You're not staying here. Come along. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Bye bye. Bye. Nice to have seen you. You look really good. - Vincent supporting you? - Yes. - Bye girls. Thanks Mia... - Bye! See you soon. Take care of yourself. - Bye. - Ciao. You see, before, people... ...confided in me, they... I did enjoy that. But here, it was the opposite, it's... As if I'd become sideshow attraction. Even you speak to me differently. Me? No way. Yes you do. As if it were necessary to pay attention to me. Really? I'm unaware of it. You can't stop people thinking of you... Of all that happened to you. Yeah... Was it already raining when you left? No, well... I don't know anymore. I remember it wasn't raining. It was afterwards that it started to rain. Up until then, I remember very well. You had to go back to the hospital, right? Maybe. Yes. I do remember that well. I was in the hospital for an hour... ...when the alert was triggered. Hospitals had to stop their secondary activities... ...and prepare to receive the wounded. And then the wounded started to arrive. I remember the smell of powder in the hallways. I called you, but you didn't answer. I thought you were already at home. I was asked to sort out, more urgent, less urgent. The bullet wounds, the burns. We were told that two other places had been affected... ...that it was a coordinated attack. And all the hospitals were mobilized. In the morning, early, I got a call from the hospital... ...where you'd been taken. You were wounded. They'd taken ages to identify you because you weren't speaking... ...and you had no ID on you. I came to see you. And getting into the taxi, I passed by the street of the restaurant. There were flowers and children's drawings. It was like a hallway in which people paraded... ...silently, like a procession. I'm Sarah, I look after this association. Well, I was in the attack. That's understood... - What's your name? - Mia. All right, Mia, sit down. I'll be with you shortly. It's great that you came. No, me neither. But you have to. It's important that you sleep... You recover your strength. Because that way, your memory will work better too. Once you can remember... - it's the beginning of healing. - You're right. - It affects the rest. - Yes. Can you sit somewhere else? Please. My parents were sitting there. Sorry, I didn't know. I'm sorry. Can I... I stand here? - Pardon. - Where were you sitting? I was in the other room. I was not with my parents that night. I'd like to know the last words they said. Know what they were talking about. If they were happy then. If they had argued, I don't know. Do you understand? Maybe you'd seen them. I'll show you something. I have to go. - Are you leaving? - I don't know why I came. Sorry, I was with someone claustrophobic. He can't come in but he wants to talk to you. Thanks. Do you remember me? No. But... I was at the table across from you. We were celebrating a birthday. I don't remember anything anymore. You ordered a glass of wine. I thought you were expecting someone. In a fraction of a second, you've disappeared. Chinese women were screening you. When you reappeared, you had ink on your hands. You were looking for a handkerchief. The more you searched... ...the more ink you put everywhere on yourself. You had a bit on your face. You made me laugh. Did you laugh at me? No no not at all. That's what you thought. That I was laughing at you. You looked at me... ...looking very upset. But... Yes that's it. Actually, I... I was writing, I had a fountain pen. I was writing? I dunno. Maybe, I guess so. What happened then? Then you got up. You walked through the restaurant, you had to go to the toilets. Don't you remember anything? No. The moments have disappeared, I can't remember. At least, not very well. I still have... ...images before the attack, sounds... But when I saw the first dead, everything is... erased. I remember nothing. You're in luck. - It's your car? - Yeah. What is your name? Mia. - Mia. - And you? It's Thomas. Do you have the right to drive? No. It's okay, it's good. Go ahead! Hey, I'm coming! - Move your car, I'm in a hurry. - Look at my leg! I think when I woke up... ...she grabbed my hand, and... ...she pulled me towards her, I followed her. And then, I don't know anymore. Mia? - You're back already? - Yes I... - I was talking to Thomas. - Yes, that's good. He reminded me of something that I'd forgotten. I was sitting there. That's very good. That way you can rebuild the puzzle. What are you doing here? Pardon? I was there, like you. I was sitting there. Not here, no, not at all. You were in the toilet I recognize you. You went there at the first shot. Me? Yes you. You locked the door while others wanted to hide. But you didn't open. How dare you come here? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. - I have... - You thought of yourself first. How does... How do you dare to come here today? You should be ashamed. It's terrible what you did. What are you doing? Sorry, I'm going. Going where? Home. I'll meet you there. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Sorry, sir, sorry. Excuse me. Yes, hello, it's Mia. We met at the restaurant, we talked. I... Maybe you can help me. Could you call me back? Thanks. Hello? Thanks for calling me back. I thought you could maybe help me... I'm sorry. Are you sure you don't mind? Yes? Good evening. Good evening. Sarah gave me your number but she didn't mention the hospital. Everything's good. I was due for surgery this afternoon. but it will be tomorrow morning. So, it's OK. I've already been operated on three times. My tibia is being rebuilt, piece by piece. But I assure you, everything is fine. I have shrapnel in the other leg. But I don't want to do that now. I'll make the pleasure last. We're not going to spend the night together. What can I do for you? It seems that you remember of everything that happened. Yes. Why do you want to remember? I may have done something. Like what? Nothing, I... Sarah told me you remember details. Maybe you remember something of what I did after leaving... Did I return to the room? No. Sit down. I don't remember seeing you come back. But maybe someone saw you. Have you visited the website? The announcement forum? No. I didn't know that existed. I'm discovering a new world. I want to remember. You can't do that alone. It takes at least two for that. I advise you to go to the websites. Do you know the association's Facebook? - No. - You should spend some time there. You'll like it... you're a journalist. I googled you. So there! Mia Loreau. Do you still work in radio? I work on the radio, sometimes, but I'm a translator from Russian. Russian translator?! Wow! It must be hard. My mother spoke Russian fluently at home... ...so not that hard. - Will you pass my cigarettes? - Yes of course. There? Can you smoke here? No, at the end of the corridor, there's an exit. I want the parka too. By the way, you didn't answer me. At the restaurant... ...were you expecting someone? No. But... ...you do have an idea why were you there? Pure chance. I didn't come here by chance. Someone had made a reservation. It was my birthday. We'd just been told the bonuses. I'm in finance. I hate celebrating my birthday. They wanted to surprise me I was pretending a little. I didn't want to offend them. You were with girls, right? Yeah, two colleagues. Well, they're not there anymore. Families came to see me. I didn't know what to tell them. I was ashamed to be there in their girls' place. Yeah. You have a husband? Yeah, but we're not married. It means you're free. That's not really the idea. Do you have children? No. I thought about that during the attack. The fact that I didn't know if I was ever going to have any. There you are! We were looking for you! - Sorry. - Visits aren't allowed in the evening. I'm sorry. I'm coming. Let's go. Come on, give it a pull! Thanks! Seeing me tomorrow? Yeah. Good luck. Arrivederci. Bring me some tangerines tomorrow. Oranges. Chocolate. Sarah made me read the police report. The attack began at 8.49pm The police released us at 10.37pm. We stayed hidden for 1 hour 48 minutes. I remember that I wondered... ...what would be found of me, after my death. How I had left my things. I thought of a half-eaten yoghurt left in the fridge. Yes, Vincent, it's me. I'm not going home. Sonia is moving, she lent me her apartment for a few days. It's at Republic. It's better for me to be alone right now. Love you. I remember that noise. What did I do? Where were you? In room 1, at the bar with a girlfriend. She died instantly. I had a hard time putting things back together. It wasn't easy. When we created the association... I didn't think so many people would need to come back here. But we're part of the same family. If you want to come tomorrow with us... Republic Square... We're going to gather before they take away the flowers and candles. Yes. I came to Paris for my architecture studies. I fell in love, I stayed. Do you remember anything? No sorry. I'm wasting your time. Not at all, that's what we're here for. Do you know the jewel in trauma? No. The idea that at the heart of misfortune, good can happen. You'll find yours, I'm sure. Can we try again? Of course. Imagine the room without all that. It was a junk-room, much darker. Up there, people managed to hide. No, it wasn't there. The light has changed too. No, that wasn't it. I remember drops of water on my hand. It's the other one, then. Come. Wait, I'll light it. Was it here? Yes. There was someone with me. They held my hand. I no longer remember his face, but he had a tattoo. A tattoo on his forearm. A bloody apron. In this area, there were people from the kitchens. Maybe he was a cook. But many died. I wish I could help you, but... Some employees haven't been accounted for. That's what I heard. Good morning. Do you remember me? I have a question. Alright. - Are there any employees left from the night of the attack? - No. Are you sure? Yes, I said. They've all been replaced. Even the cooks...? - Waiters? - Even the cooks are gone. Listen, I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. Would you take care of the other room? Please. I haven't finished this one. You'll finish later. Thanks. OK. Good morning. - We saw each other, remember? - Yes. Do you know Thomas? - No. - With the crutches. He was here. - A little. - He told me you worked there. I have some questions. About the people who worked with you. I need you... I'm looking for someone. OK, but not for long. I live far away. I'm looking for the man who I was with during the attack. He was a cook. He had an apron, anyway. And he had a tattoo there. I haven't seen him among the dead. Lots of cooks were illegals. That's why they're not... they're not listed. They vanished into thin air. So they're not dead? Everyone has been changed. I stayed, I'm French. The boss was OK about keeping me. The police asked questions. They thought it was weird that employees disappeared. We said nothing. Do you know their names? Promise you don't mention me. I'm risking trouble... I can't lose my job. I promise. - What's your name? - Nour. Mia. I also searched for the person I was with. We were hidden in the false ceiling, in the vents. I was so sure I'd die, that we kissed. He was an Australian who was visiting Paris. Did you see him again? No. We were separated during the evacuation. He was slightly injured. I searched for him like crazy on Facebook. But I haven't found him. We were to the right of the entrance. We were four, two died. And me and the Australian. I saw the killer during the attack. He had the face of an angel. I don't know, he was... He was smiling. He looked so nice. We would have said that he was going to buy cigarettes. After what happened, I went home. Lucky for me, that was quite far away. I still haven't told anybody what happened that night with you. I don't even know your name. I haven't even told my girlfriend. Weird... I tell my girlfriend everything. That day was without a doubt the most horrible day of my life. But then again I've never felt so close to anybody. You held me like I was the only thing left. I know you tried to reach me. I haven't replied, and to be honest I won't. It would only just make me think of you more. I don't want to think about you every day. But I do. Excuse me, can I talk to you? Look at me, please. I was not in the toilets. I remember well, now. I was there, but before the attack. What do you know about it? I've remembered. I was holding someone's hand. A cook. You've confused me with someone else. It doesn't matter, but... You've confused me. If it makes you happy. Good evening. Sorry to bother you, I know it's late. I saw you, earlier. Well, come in. I don't have anything. Like some water? Yes, thank you. Have you found who you're looking for? No. I want to know if he's alive. There's this woman, you see... ...who accuses me of having locked myself away. But I believe there's another reason. She doesn't know either. If you feel he's alive... ...they kept the belongings of the victims at the police headquarters. - Really? - Yes. - Didn't you see it on Facebook? - No. You should go see. You might find something. I went there with my aunt. They keep everything in plastic bags. There's a funny smell. There wasn't much, only a postcard for me. I have it, if you want. It's 'The Water Lilies'. They'd asked me to come with them. We'd been shouting at each other all day. I can no longer leave someone without reconciling with them. We don't know what can happen. When I knew, I texted my dad. He replied that they were hidden. They were waiting for the police. He said they couldn't call me, not to be heard. This is where the wait began. We didn't know what was going on we were helpless. At one point, we just turned off the TV. We held hands. You shouldn't think about it now. You should sleep. Sometimes I feel like I recognize them in the street. I would like to go to the museum where they have been. See the latest things that they saw. Find this painting. I'd feel I was saying goodbye to them. It's hot in here, isn't it? You got anything to eat? I'm sorry, I've nothing here. I'll get you something at the grocer's, okay? We'll get out of this. Breathe. Again... breathe. Felicia? This is yours, isn?t it? Yes. We found this in the bag. You can verify. No, it's fine. A signature, then. Thanks. A code red here, please. Hurry! Come and sit down here. Just here. - There was someone with me. - We're taking care of them. Like that. - Press harder. - Let us pass. - I have three. - I'm missing three! Great. - Do you need a hand? - No, thank you. I got you a present. How nice. It seems to make you happy. Yes, it's good. Improving my mind. Whatever. I called you but you didn't answer. I didn't have my phone. You didn't want to go back. Yes... I did what you said. I returned to the restaurant. And... I remembered something. What? I was holding a man's hand. I want to know if he's alive. I?m not sure that remembering is going to help you. Believe me... I believe that... it's not a good idea. You alright? Do you have painkillers? No, but I don't want anything. I'll open the window. No, it's fine. Stop fussing... I'm OK. Here... Read to me instead. I feel you'd read very well. But... - No one ever read me stories. - Me neither. If it bothers you, I can close my eyes. Go on. - You want me to close them? - Yes. OK. Good morning. Good morning. I'm Estelle, Thomas's wife. We met because of... I'll leave you now. Hold on. No, don't go. He has to sign some documents for insurance. - Bye. - Bye. You OK? Yeah. Listen, sign this. Wait! I'm sorry, I didn't know what you've been through. I can't share it with him. Thomas doesn't know, but I do. We won't be able to overcome this. I understand. Here. He doesn't read anyway. I read the ads that people publish on the Memoria forum. Like Felicia, they want to know how their loved ones died... ...or they're trying to find people. I'm looking for a man who helped me... ...wounded in both ankles, room 1, near the bar. I'd like to know if he survived. I think of him every day. The woman close beside me was shot... ...twice in the chest. With a heather-purple or pink T-shirt. I didn't ask the question for fear of stirring up too many memories. If you know what has become of her, contact me in PM. I was evacuated at the very end. Only dead people remained. I tried not to look. People just looked asleep. I hope it can calm some of you. We were hiding in a place... ...with water dripping from the ceiling. You asked me my name, I didn't ask for yours. You had a tattoo and a work apron. You gripped my hand. We clung to each other. When the police arrived, I let go of your hand. The last time I saw you, you were wounded. I hope you made it out. I hope you are alive. That's all I want to know. What are you doing here? I call you, you don't answer. I worry. Well, come in. I don't understand what you're doing. You have someone, don't you? Is that the association thing? You don't want to talk to me? - Vincent, what are you doing? - Come on. It's gone on long enough. You're going home. - No. - That's enough. Vincent, no, put that down. Why won't you talk to me? Don't you want me to help you? There's nothing you can do for me. I really can't do anything for you? I can't go back to life as it was... I simply can't. Why not? What for? I have to watch you going crazy, and do nothing about it? I'd have been better off, being in that fucking attack. Nour found the names of two chefs from the 'Etoile d'Or'. They'd disappeared from the staff registers. The manager was going to seek emergency personnel... ...through a phone-card shop. Undocumented immigrants came there to find paid-by-the-day jobs. No one knew the names she had given me. But I was told about an agent who worked in the restaurant business. Hello. No thanks. I'm looking for Hakim. Want to talk to me? Yes. Want anything? No thanks. I want information about a cook... ...who worked at the Etoile d'Or. No, I wouldn't know. Who told you about me? I don't understand. I'm looking for someone who worked there before the attack. Someone who was placed there. No. Maybe you have a name, an address. You don't know his name? You don't know the people you place? I don't place anyone. I'm not a people-renter, I work here. I have two cooks, a kitchen hand. I know their address, that's all. I want to help you, but I don't know who you're talking about. If someone said nonsense about me, I'd like to know who. It's not about you. I'm looking for someone. She helped me. That's all. Who sent you here? Forget it. Thanks. Hey! Yes? I know the guy you're looking for. - He's a Senegalese with a tattoo. - That's him. I saw him often, he disappeared. You know him? Yes. Well, I don't know his name. Driss Mbow. That's the name on the papers we lent him. He doesn't use them in real life. He lives in a hostel at Porte de la Chapelle. "France Horizon". And I'm not renting identities. We just help each other. OK? OK. Somebody there? Hello. Sorry, the door was open... I'm looking for Driss Mbow. Go play on the bed. - You know him? He's a relative? - No. I was in the attack with him. Did he tell you about it? I just want to know if he's okay. I don't know if that's his real name. It's Assane. Not Driss. Assane. He's alive? Don't know. He went to Italy, I don't know where. Sorry, can I? Two seconds. Yes, I have water. Here. He left me stuff. You want to see? If he ever comes back, will you let me know? Yes. He's not family, but we traveled together. I'll leave you my number. Can I get a picture of him? Yes of course. I'd worked at the Etoile d'Or for six months. If the Senegalese, Malians and Sri Lankans were on strike... ...Paris wouldn't eat. Restaurant owners call us photocopiers. They say we can copy a plate to perfection. A transfer. How much? In my life, I have always been lucky. I walk between the raindrops. The boss asked me to go down to the cellar. I heard the gun-bursts at the last second. She didn't notice right away that she was hurt. I promised her that we weren't going to die. Not here. I had been through too many dangers to die here. I have to find this detail in the painting. Before, I never asked myself if I was happy. Now, yes. But we were very happy. - Yes, but... - I don't understand. Why do you associate me with this? What's it got to do with me? It's just that now I know it's necessary... ...that I do something about my life. Something new. We should have had a child. You wouldn't talk like that. But if... It wouldn't have changed anything. It's a choice we shared, isn't it? I don't regret it. You can tell me. That night, weren't you in the hospital? Yes, of course. But you weren't there for an emergency. You were going to meet someone. No, it wasn't an emergency. - Good evening. - How are you? You OK? Fine, and you? I'm not intruding? Not at all, we invited lawyers for procedural matters. So, did you find him? No. No. And I have no leads. I'm sorry. I know it's hard. Indeed, it was a bit late. Yeah, it seems it was. I wanted to talk to you. I'll leave you to it. Can I talk to you again, if it doesn't bother you? All right. I know it wasn't you in the toilets. What makes you say that? I was wrong, I... I was confused. I know you weren't there. My husband died there, and... I got things mixed up. - Was there someone else in the toilets? - Yes. Do you know who it was? It was me. Forgive me. - Okay... - Ciao. Goodbye. - Sorry for last time. - No. - Yes I am. - No no. - Yes. - It's me, I... Yeah? I wanted to call you, I... Me too, I wanted to... but I didn't dare. Did you find him? No. - Come on, let's go in. - Come on! We're ghosts... no one will see us. Have a look. What's it like? It's lively, looks good. And... are there people? Yes, there are people. Plenty of room. Yeah? OK, here we go. But I'll check the emergency exits. There are bound to be, if the bride changes her mind. You need an exit, in case of misfortune. There's the bride! Nice atmosphere. That's a call. It's a call to... Well I'm going. - Coming? - No. Come on! Come on! Come on, come on! - It's okay, you're... - I'm a bit hot. I have to breathe. But... I believe we... We've got to do what we should've done that night. What? I would have waited for you. Coming back from the toilet... To speak to you. I would've stood up. I would've brought you a drink. You would've looked at me. I would've made you laugh. - Would that 've worked? - Yes. I'm very funny. Yes, I believe it would've worked. You have to ward off fate. So I believe. It's a scar. I have one too. Got to go. Where are you going? I just have one last thing to do. OK. - See you later. - Yes. Esse! Esse! - Good morning. - How are you? Good morning. Go have a snack, kids. - You OK? - Yes. I tried to call you, it didn't work. - I changed my phone number. - Really? You see, I've... I've written a letter for Assane. Do you have his address in Italy? I heard he wasn't there. I believe he came back. He came back? Really? Yes. It seems he's working near the Eiffel Tower. - Do you know this person? - No. No? Hello, I'm looking for this person. - Does that remind you of someone? - No, I don't know him. No, you don't know? You lost him? I'll have this one, the chocolate doughnut. Hello, could I have a coffee? 5 for this one. Can you speak Spanish? - It's a lot. - No, it's a good price. 10 euros is a lot. This one? - Yeah. - Five euros. - Five euros? - Snowballs? - You want snowballs? Ten euros. - How much are those? Five euros. It's a good price. You want the big one? Ten euros. Ten euros? No. - I'll take it for five. - Five? - Yes. - Thank you. Where are you from? Wisconsin. Wisconsin? Yes, thanks, man. We walked aimlessly for a long time. It did him good to know that I was alive somewhere. I had the same feeling as him. We were alive. I was alive. Thanks for holding my hand. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
