As we return here to the Seagull Center the sight of the last regular season game for VCU this year. Rams trying to avoid losing four out of their last five. The Rams, they've got to get it going here. Rodriguez picks it up. Clocking run, Joey's gonna drive. Joe picks up the dribble, gives a left side to Skeen. Off to Rozzell. Two seconds he's got to shoot it. Off balance Shepard, no and the Rams fall by three. So a tough one for the Rams here at the Seagull Center. 72-69 JMU the final victor this afternoon. - We were in a bad way, we were in a tough spot because we had just lost our last two regular season games and we lost on senior day to James Madison here which was just a crushing defeat for so many reasons and a few days later we're in the practice gym. We really in a lot of ways hadn't recovered from those loses yet but it's March 1st. - I've been through several bad seasons in college basketball. My last season with Jeff Jones at Virginia, we won 12 games. My first year at Carolina as Associate AD we won eight games but the February here was one of the worst I've ever been through because of the fact that our fans have high expectations. We lost two very bad games at home, three actually. And the last four, five minutes of the James Madison game I went into my office and hid and watched it from the office. I had a feeling in the back of my mind, everybody can say this but I did have a feeling in the back of my mind. I said this may be the best thing that's ever happened to us. Yeah it was Tuesday morning when we had practice leading up to CA Tournament week and coach came up to me and said, Tim I need you to come in here, I need you to grab a couple things, I need a lighter and a big desk calendar. Month of February page. So what coach did was he came in, had a little trash can in one hand and in the other hand he had the month of February. On a calendar. Picks it up and he says, "February is over, it's a new start, it's a new day." Takes out a lighter, sparks it. - And it's burning and I'm talking as it's burning, I'm talking about putting this thing behind us and that February is over and it's burning, it's burning, it's getting closer to my hand. So finally I dropped in into the trashcan but it was a piece of paper on fire so it kind of floated around and there was shreds of it that didn't go into the trashcan, it went on the floor so had to kind of stomp those out. There was no threat of a major fire and I think we got the guys attention. This is a great opportunity to play for. We win three straight games and we're going to championship. That would definitely make my whole season much better. Three of the screen on its way. They got it. Hits a three to tie it. We're tied at 60. There's 11 seconds to play. Rodriguez towards the left side, eight seconds to go. Gets a screen out front from Skeen, Rodriguez to Nixon. Nixon's gonna feed the low post with three seconds. Skeen with two. Skeen with one, turns around, shoots of the glass. He got it! He got it! He got it to go! He got it to go, the Rams win at the buzzer. - We're just like a culmination of everybody just growing up and just worried about winning. And VCU's crowd starting to sense it. And they are looking to have a seven o'clock day tomorrow night to play for the right to go to the NCAA. And what I'm amazed that is the team managed to pull themselves out of that slump at the most critical junction of the season and rise above. I didn't expect that. There's nobody in here that gave this team a chance. Except sitting on that beach. Except everybody on that bench. What attracted me to VCU was a lot of things. Outstanding fans, terrific tradition, a great administrative support, a phenomenal arena and just the opportunity to continue to build on a program that was already exploding. VCU Basketball has become extremely popular to say the least in the city of Richmond. We sell out most of our games, we're always having new people come to games from the community. I've never seen so many young kids bring their parents to VCU games. They love the atmosphere, they love the fun, they love the packed gymnasium, they love that we win. You always wanna build a program and make it better and better. It's not necessarily a jump that you take on daily basis but it's something that you work towards on a daily basis. - The expectations have been raised significantly since I've been here in these 23 years. Most notably since Jeff Kapel started in 2002, 2003. Then through Anthony Grant then through Shaka Smart. The expectations have gone up exponentially. When coach Smart got here and I had an opportunity to work for him and NFVCU was a no brainer. You always want to be at a job where you have a chance to win your league, maybe every year or every couple years. VCU's one of those jobs and then you know when you make the NCAA Tournament anything can happen. Maynor is this is dagger? You have just seen the biggest upset in today's first round of the NCAA Tournament. - Well it was a transition between Anthony and Shaka. You know Anthony as people say has a big fearful presence on the side lines he won three regular seasons in a row, two CAA Championships. So Shaka had to transition and the fans had to transition. The way he was able to manage a team who had won at the highest level. Keep in mind they won at the highest level but they won when they were freshmen and sophomores with a guy who's now having a great NBA career and Eric Maynor. So it was a lot of growth there on both sides of the fence. VCU. Unless every team that's already in the tournament wins and there's virtually no upset, is probably gonna be on the outside looking in on Selection Sunday coming up this week. And Outlets and Rodriguez four seconds to go, Joey's gonna hoist one and it is short, no good. Old Dominion get the rebound and the Monarchs are the CAA Champions of 2011 as they drop the banner in the Richmond Colosseum with a 70 to 65 win over the VCU Rams and there student body. I was upstairs in my office and I was up there with our five freshman. I made them come watch the Selection Show with me. I made the decision not to make our team watch it because I knew it could go either way. We might get it, we might not get in. - I wasn't even watching Selection Sunday at all. I had a buffalo chicken wrap and everybody was telling me that we ain't have a chance of getting in and even coach Smart was telling us, you know don't bank on it. He didn't want us to get our hopes up. I was actually at home on my couch with my laptop, wondering what would come of the show. And you know I thought all weekend something is strange here because all these guys who have unbelievable record for picking the right people still have us on. - The whole time I thought we were gonna get in. I told everybody that nobody believed me, everybody wanted to not watch it and I was like I'm watching it 'cause we're gonna get in. - I was in my room, doing homework. With the door closed 'cause Joey kept screaming out all kinds of stuff when the teams kept popping up on the screens. - A lot of us thought we had a chance, we had a chance but these other teams have a chance. If they get in before us we're not getting in and then when you saw UAB you're like oh man. UAB just took our spot. That 18 point lead that we had has just come back in the worst case scenario kicked us right in the stomach. - Certainly when UAB and Clemson were called in the first match up of the first four that worries you a little bit because you know there's only one game left that you probably have an opportunity to be a part of. - I remember looking at Shaka and said, I don't think so, it's not looking good and I went back into my office and I was ready to dial a phone number and everybody just went crazy. - I had my phone sitting right here, my food just all right here, my drink right here. My phone is vibrating off the hook but I didn't want to answer it because I had so much buffalo sauce on my hands. - I was eating a cheeseburger, and got the news that we had made it to the NCAA Tournament. - I didn't even see who we were playing when our name came across we just went ballistic. So we were hugging and running around. - I saw VCU on there I didn't jump, I didn't even see USC. I just started jumping up and I left the room and started screaming. He said we in and once I heard that we ran out here in this court yard and was just going nuts. - I started to run bu then I was like hold on let me slow down, I need to save my energy for the tournament. - I remember just pointing at the TV going, we're in, we're in and then the rest was history. We could make a case for any team being into the NCAA Tournament. We can make a case for any team being out of the NCAA Tournament. I can't make a case for UAB. I can't make a case for VCU. - I spent the next two days defending their selection. Not just on the radio show but to about a half a dozen other radio shows around this region and around the country who called us to say, what do you think about VCU getting in. - I've seen UAB play, I've seen VCU play. I've looked at all the numbers, not that that matters. All of the teams on that screen, sort of the snubble at the quote on quote snubblist, should of gotten in before those two. All of them and there was a reason why none of us brought up UAB and VCU as having a chance to get in. Because they had no chance to get in. And then they did. - The committee has gone against their own principles. - The committee looked for not just quality wins but quality wins away from home. Whether it's a neutral court or whether its' a true road game and VCU had those. Where as Virginia Tech and Colorado, two of the schools did not. My wife knows diddly about basketball but if you put her here and said look at Colorado's resume, look at UAB and look at VCU, it'll be an A mismatch man. It would be like a beauty contest. Roseanne Barr walking in vs Scarlet Johanson. No sha. - I sort as a coach and great. I don't have to do the motivating. Coach doesn't have to do the motivating. The media's doing it for our guys right now. - I think we can always take a look back at those comments that were made on Selection Sunday and we will always have something to prove. - The Selection, we had no basketball IQ. This is a joke. And all that stuff on national TV talking about you guys I mean it's kind of embarrassing. It makes you feel bad at first. It makes you angry. - These were bad decisions and you know we talk about the eye test. This one fails the laugh test. - The thing that helped me the most with that is that I had the first scout against southern Cal so I was so focused on them I didn't, you know I didn't really know what else was going on. I was already watching film on them while Jay Billis I guess was ripping us. Let's go out here and play theses three guys right from the jump. Question them all from the jump, can't wait till the last minute of the night. It's all we got, this moment right here. Kill or be killed, you know. Let's do it. Kill on three, one, two, three. Kill! I don't know if it was just the second life type of thing, but I just felt like we were focused. But yet focused enough and loose enough that we had a chance. - We were definitely talented enough and we had size and our style of play definitely affect BCS teams. But then again you're playing against BCS at the end of the year and the NCAA Tournament. You know the odds are more against you then they are for you but you know we put ourselves in a position early in the year to instill some confidence into the NCAA Tournament. That if we do get in, hey we can play with some of these teams. We could beat some of these teams and our guys had a great level of confidence. We still wanted to go after people. We still wanted to be the aggressor and we knew that some of the teams that we were playing were not ready for our style of play. And I know that for me personally the only game that I was anxious about was the USC game because I didn't really know a lot about them going in. They had really two really, really big guys that if we let get going that was going to be a big time issue for us. We spend a lot of time preparing for their bigs, preparing for playing smash mouth basketball around the rim. Inside Skeen. You know I remember both teams coming out a little nervous at the beginning I think there was some nervous energy. We didn't play well in the first half. It was low scoring, it was sort of their style. The way they wanted to gain the tempo wise. And towards the second half, you know we began to play our brand of basketball which is havoc and pressing and getting up and down, speeding up the tempo and you know I think it became to our advantage. With a bucket, beautifully done. Rob Brandenberg a freshman. - Rob Brandenberg made a couple nice plays to drive down the lane. Made a great steal and bang the three right before half that have us great momentum going in the locker room. As a coach says, the best way to have momentum going in the second half is you take in the locker room with you and Rob really created that for us. - The way we played started really in the second half of the USC game. Our guys were so locked in and so together. They were so on the same page offensively in terms of creating baskets for one another that we were just so hard to guard and at the same time we were doing a terrific job on our defense of men. Slicing and dicing... Objected, great job by Burgess. Toward the court right now for VCU. A long jump shot, it is good. Again Brandon Rozzell, Inside, no.. Reddic and yes! Juvonte Reddic the freshmen. Drives, kicks, it's up and good. Ed Nixon. That's a big time shot. His first basket of the game. The ring is inside. - When we beat USC it was like the most glorious moment in the world. It ended there we would still be in the spring going what a great win to date and we beat USC. It ws incredible wasn't it. We were so happy. We have VCU head coach Shaka Smart. Coach you could you start with an opening statement then we'll take a few questions. - Really excited about this match up with Georgetown tomorrow, they have a storied basketball program with a terrific coach and very talented players. So it's gonna be a heck of a challenge for us. Our guys did a great job yesterday, buying into and executing our game plan against USC and I think that's what allowed us to win. We got into Chicago about 3:30 in the morning but our guys were able to get plenty of rest today and will get more rest tonight. We'll be ready to go tomorrow. How long did you give yourself last night to celebrate the win before you started thinking of Georgetown and what do you think you need to take away from Georgetown in order to win? Well as far as a celebration it wasn't too much time because you know we got back in the locker room after the game and we tried to have a mini celebration as a team after every win because one of the things we talk about in our program is don't take any win for granted. I don't care who it's against or what time of year it is and we want to make sure our guys understood, hey we just won an NCAA Tournament game but really from there we went to talk to the media and it was full steam ahead to preparing for Georgetown. And we were fortunate to win last night and again it's another quick turnaround. But our guys are basketball players, they're competitors. They would have played today if the game was today and we'll do what we need to do from a preparation standpoint, a tactical standpoint but that's a distant second to having our minds right. And making sure that we're in attack mode going in this game tomorrow night. - We're having a blast, I mean we're in the NCAA Tournament, had a chance to beat Georgetown, had traditional power, you know we thought we were prepared. We liked the way our guys were playing. Our guys were you know confident, loose. An attacking mindset which we talked about. - Gosh it was just such a, it was a great time. I've been to other NCAA Tournaments when you're, you're not that excited to play the first game 'cause you're playing a lower level team or you're worried about losing. And we were just let's go at it. Even fans were like that. - Early in the USC game, early in the Georgetown game, it wasn't a smooth going game. It was slow, it was methodical. It was almost sometimes down right ugly. - The game was extremely tense. - But our guys, that was a great thing about our approach throughout the whole NCAA Tournament. They had great result. They did a really good job of when things weren't going on our way not to get down, not to get upset, not to point fingers. They just kept playing and when you keep playing and remain focus at the task at hand then you make a big shot or you make a big steal that leads to a great play. A teammate gets a great assist you get an easy basket and then that's where it sort of snowballs and you get the momentum. Here comes the waves. Numbers. Here's a three. And the Rams back in front. Skeen with an inside shot. From three point land. It was Rozzell again slams the triple. But it's put back by Skeen and VCU up four points. Rozzel with an inside, nice flick over the shoulder by Burgess. That was a three pointer and Ed Nixon has given the Rams a 14 point lead. They are running away he's off the floor now. 10 for 17 from downtown. VCU is owning this place tonight. Shaka's fine company are on. They defeat Georgetown 74-56. Interviews and reaction are coming your way next. - I think that was the one that really opened everybody's eyes. The USC win they're like, well USC shouldn't have gotten the tournament either so what's the big deal. Whey the thumped Georgetown that woke up the entire nation. The people are gonna be stunned by the margin of this game, are you a little bit surprised? - Not at all. I'm very confident in our team and when we play our brand of basketball, any basketball game. I feel like we can compete with any team in the country as well as create a great margin on the court. So I mean with all due respect to Georgetown, we just play VCU basketball and worked out for the best. Work, yeah that tonight. Worked out for the best for us tonight. There you go. Okay thank you. - Everybody but the team and the coach and staff was surprised. I guarantee you. Everybody I mean listen the team wasn't surprised. The coaches wan't surprised but everybody else, I was surprised. I was eating my ice cream, I was loving it. I was like wow. I know how difficult it is as a player getting to the sweet sixteen. I mean that next level is really tough. It's just really tough. Well when we started the year, we gave our team a motto. And it was, our time right now. Eric Mayers now in the NBA. Larry Sanders is now in the NBA. This is your tee. This is our time. And right now part of it is, it's now or never. Because at this point obviously in the season when you lose you go home. Once again you know there was the endless end that Purdue was the best defensive team. Best defensive team in the nation. We really didn't care about what the enemies was saying, we just went out there and played our style of basketball. Shot block at 13 seconds. High from Haley. Rodriguez into the corner for Nixon. This is Jamie Skeen likes to match up. Shot is good and Rams off in running in a 2-0 lead. Smith along two. That's big for the team. Skeen muscling his way inside. Burgess for three. And PCU leads 7-2. We said they only had two guys on the court and Ron Johnson and we wanted the other guys to make plays. Bonus time for Purdue. Zero points. - Smith got free from some jump shots against the press. We play the way we do that, that's gonna happen sometimes. That's okay. It's collateral damage. Then with Johnson, he's a great player. Our guys did a good job on him. He got a free a few times around the basket. I think the thing that helped us, is we made him work for everything he got. Particularly for the first 35 minutes of the game. And that tired him out. Set up for Reddic. Who's got the early hot hand. Wow. Haley stuffs it in. - And the shots kept going in. And we kept turning them over, and we kept defending and challenging jump shots on the other end forcing them to play faster, and it was textbook. Rozzell for three. And it's all VCU of nine points. Robby set up Jackson to Terrone Johnson. Sufficating interior defense, here comes Burgess. Rozzell for three. And right VCU looks like the three seed. Here is goes. Burgess drops off to Skeen. That play is absolutely destroying. Nixon. They are just teaming off on the Purdue defense. I had felt in my mind the biggest step for VCU basketball was to go to the sweet sixteen. I think that term by our name was a tremendous step forward for us. - We went from five tournament wins for the program to eight in a matter of five days. - You almost can't believe it's happening, and you know taking place before your eyes. But it was thrilling to watch. Again I went down the floor I was waiting for the team to come off. We hadn't won yet. It was Shaka had put in the subs and we were gonna win. And it me, and I knew then, oh my gosh. We've made history and we've taken a huge leap for this program. - I think that's when it started to dawn on me that this was becoming the story of the tournament. The Rams were becoming the story in college basketball. By the way they had just throttled a pack ten team, a big leagues team and then a big ten team. - VCU advancing to the sweet sixteen for the very first time and coach I gotta say, three games you played in this tournament so far, you've made each win look easy. How are you guys gonna keep this going to the next round? Well these guys are playing with so much energy and they're playing together on every single possession. It's easy when you play that way. We obviously got great teams coming up, we gotta play even harder. - You know I'm loving this underdog thing. You know we got a great team we're playing great basketball right now and hopefully we keep it going. Keep it going congratulations Joey. Enjoy you guys. - One of the best things you can do to advance your campaign as a high level program is win. Particularly at this time of year. So you have to maintain vast majority of your focus should be on winning and preparing to win. Preparing your guys to have the right mindset to allow you to win. You ever seven points a game as a freshman? - I think my wife told me the other day, VCU was one of the top two or three most googles names over the weekend. So it's great for our university. It's great for everyone involved in our program. At the same time we can't let it overwhelm us or take from our preparation because we're not done. Anytime that we play a team from one of the BCS leagues, it's a chance to show that we belong among you know the top teams in the country. Even though we're not in one of those leagues. And the tournament here has been a great opportunity because we've played Pack Ten, Big East, Big Ten, now we play ACC and it's like a murderers row. But we've won and we've won convincingly. So I think what that does is it shows, first and foremost we've got pretty good players here. And secondly we've got a very good basketball program that belongs in the conversation. The national conversation about the top teams. One thing that was a major whit of emphasis from out standpoint was, we are not going to add any level of anxiety or pressure onto an already huge pressure packed situation. In fact we're gonna do everything we can to relieve that. That's why when we came out to the open practice, we had fun. You got about five, six guys on the team that think they're our best shooters. That think they can shoot with you. But Joey Rodriguez is gonna shoot with you right now. So we're gonna go best at ten. We're gonna shoot ten threes and you're gonna shoot ten threes. - I'm on Joeys side. - From the strength coach to the athletic trainer to tall of our players, to our coaches. Everyone was out there to stay loose and have fun. We had a job to do but at the same time we knew that if we didn't go about this without trying to make it fun, then it wouldn't be fun. And we also knew that this was a moment that we'd be crazy not to soak in and enjoy. And I think that's one thing we did a great job of is to man, everybody soaked it in. - You guys well done, it's been fun to watch your team play. Good luck to you guys tomorrow. Have fun. Thanks. - Being loose does not mean you know being not focused. Being loose means you know lets go out and if we make a mistake it's not the end of the world. You know lets have fun, lets just play our sprain of basketball. Lets just worry about what we can control. And that's our team and how well we play. And if things go wrong and you know we're gonna have to resolve whether it's getting a bad call or shots aren't going in. You know, we can't control this sorts of things. I mean our guys were very locked in on the scan report and I think that you know everybody was bought into the max throughout the tournament. And you know that makes it fun, that's what makes it fun when everybody is on board like that. - You know I was concerned about every team because you know I saw them play some during the year but you know you're busy with your own world here at VCU and VCU basketball so you don't see a lot of games. But I knew Florida State was extremely long and I knew they were gonna be very good on the defensive end. - I thought we'd have a hard time scoring against them and I wondered if we could score enough to beat them. But I was concerned that we were playing a different level athlete. - By far the most athletic and longest team we played in two years that I've been at VCU. We know that we're the best team here tonight. We know it. Deep down in here we know it. Florida State don't know it yet. We gotta go show them. Lets go. Playing Florida State we knew it was gonna be a battle. We knew it was gonna be a grind. Throughout the season they had consistently helped teams in the 50's, in the low 60's. - And they were one of the best defensive teams in the country we saw at first hand. - They've got six or seven big's who could all play just about anywhere in the country. They got guys coming of their bench who would start at about 80 percent of the BCS schools in the country. - Why would they be worried about playing VCU? They play Duke Carolina on the road. Lets do it baby. We all we got it. Right here, right now. For the jump off. Nobody believe it when I say that. How we get it? How we gonna get it? You know what I mean? Lets get it. We welcome you back to San Antonio, Texas for out continuing coverage of the 2011 NCAA tournament team two of the southwest regional semi-final doubleheader. The 11th seed Virginia Commonwealth making it to the sweet sixteen for the very first time. Going up against the 10th seed Seminoles of Florida State. The winner advancing to the elite eight to play the Jayhawks of Kansas. What a great sign for Florida State. Averaged about five a game. - Well you know we needed to control the tempo, and I think that, that kind of fits for just our brand of basketball with havoc. You know we need to control the tempo as much as possible. Great pass by Rodriguez. And the dunk by Reddic. It's like we can't the when we don't score. We can't let it affect our energy defensiveness. - I feel like that Florida State was the best defensive team that we played all year. - Brad Burgess made like three or four great moves and couldn't get to the rim. And you know they were going after every shot and it was it was huge. They would have guys in front of me. Looking straight like it's facing me, facing me, and he didn't care about what was going on out there. He didn't care. As long as I didn't get the ball. Against this size and speed. With the front line of Florida State you can't just wobble past towards the hoop. Everything has to be crisp. Florida State by four. - We finally got the street fight that you expect to have from the very first game that you play in NCA tournament. You don't expect to be... You might expect to win but you don't expect to win by 13, 18 and 18. - I think that's the most vivid game of the tournament for me because it was a tight game and every bucket was scrutinized and they were up and then they were down. - But that game I can say no one's off their head, and everybody was pushing each other. We were still you know scoring without them getting me involved. Rodriguez for three yes. Jaime Skeen on a freaking roll with Joey Rodriguez. And that's their game. Especially tonight. We gotta get long rebounds and steals and get out and transition because there's no just openings against Florida State. - That was a big stage and just to come out and even get on the court and just play to your ability is very hard. Florida State's defense everywhere. Final second of the half. - I mean the things that we did as individuals that's just confidence from the coaches and our teammates. Got a two. Got a one. Darius Theus, with a beautiful shot for Virginia Commonwealth. - The first game was not close, and Kansas had beat Richmond and all the Kansas fans were rooting which there were what, 20 thousand Kansas fans. They're all rooting for VCU. Why would you not wanna play the 11th seed? Instead of playing, you know Florida State. So there was this energy in the building. And I sat right behind the VCU bench for that game and it was amazing to watch Shaka and his staff. I never really had that perspective. I sit court side but I never sit behind the bench. So to see the way he operates, the way the assistants operate to see the way the team interactes, especially during a close, critical game. I was mesmerized. - Those moments through the tournament, I think the growth that he's... You saw him change through the tournament. The confidence level. You know growing into his coaching skin. One of the things that gets lost in this you know they talk about the team. Saw a young coach really grow and get comfortable on the side lines. Rodriguez splits a defender. Baseball pass to Burgess. Bradford drives the lane. Gets in the air, feeds it and loses it. Taken away by Florida State. They're on the run. Now this is spare. Spare inside. Kicks left side. Dulkys, he shoots the three. It's good. Deividas Dulkys hits the tray, the five point lead is gone, it's now a two point lead for the Seminoles. They come bursting out of the locker room, they lead 38-36. - You know in those other games we got comfortable and you were to kind of relax a little but and say, hey not only can we play with these guys but we're beating them. And I think even though Florida State became a tight game, there was never a question that I thought Florida State was gonna run away with the game. One thing that never really you know, us was our confidence. You know and that's everybody. That all goes to the seniors again you know, they're a very confident group in what they do so. Now Rodriguez with the right hand triple. Joey all the way inside, off the glass. Shot does not go! Even with things like you know the they never stop fighting you know and they always believe in each other. So, I would say something like that you know. Their heart, the determination that's something I'm gonna take with me for the rest of my career. Kicks it, it just fell off the rim. And then Rodriguez comes from behind and strips it away. Joey to Burgess, squares for three. Yes sir! Bradford Burgess! He hits another three, his fourth. That's another three on it's way. He got another! Rozzell hits the three. He's hit three in the second half. Rozzell gets the splits a double he drives inside scoop shot. Good! And one! Rozzell got the scooper to go! He got the bucket to fall. VCU we'll go to the timeout with the one point lead. 50-49. Hang on to your hats everybody VCU with Florida State at a good one here for the right to go to the elite eight. We'll take a time out. We'll be back in two minutes. This is RAM radio. - I'ma tell you, they did something defensively with six or five minutes left and they shut the hose off. Now Brandenberg his pass deflected towards out of bounds. Saved and it's on the floor. Burgess has gotta... drives the leg. His shot blocked. As Snaer comes off. - They're length on the basketball court is just you know words can't describe until you're out there with them. Rozzell to Skeen. Skeen's gonna take an off balance double clutch, jumper no good. Air ball. - They defend so well, the play together, they're blocking shots. They're out there scrambling, playing team defense. And that's what they're known for. That's what Florida State is known for, is for their tough defense. And it showed out there. - They made it hard for us to score. But our guys again they kept battling, and kept battling and that was really the only time we've been tested up to that point. Picks up the dribble he's in trouble. Rodriguez in all kinds of trouble. Gives it to Skeen with two. He's gotta force it up it's blocked. Violation. And the Rams leading by three 65-62. Didn't get the look they wanted. We're one second under two minutes to go here. And VCU again will have to defend in the half court. - You know when you're broadcasting the game you're always trying to look ahead, what's gonna happen here so I can be prepared for it. You never wanna be ill prepared for what's gonna happen because that'll come across on the air. So I'm thinking, how is this gonna play out and it was difficult to imagine it because we had played so well but then again, all of a sudden gosh if they hit a couple shots, we're gonna be in some real stew here. We're getting every rebound, we're not gonna get rebounds. It's difficult to get rebounds. Now we can't even penetrate. Now we can't even get an open three. How in the world are we gonna skate this game? - Number one, I hare close games. The Florida State's a tight game the whole way, and when Singleton hits that deep three pointer late, that's like yeah well, it's been fun. It's time. Singleton hits the three with 45 seconds. What a three by Chris Singleton. And VCU and Florida State tied at 65 with 40 seconds to go. - Joey Rodriguez has a calming influence when people late. You know, he doesn't get rattled and he's over there, we're fine, we're gonna make it. VCU against the best defensive team in the country. He's got 11 seconds, here's Burgess. - One of the last seconds of regulation we wanted to give Bradford a look and obviously we gotta look and Florida State blocked it at the rim. Inside they blocked. Florida State's gonna have a chance for the last possession. Ten seconds now down to nine. This is it for the Rams, they've gotta-- - I thought our guys, especially that last one, they really locked in on that last play and said, if you're gonna make a shot you're gonna make a tough one over me. Got it. Get's a screen out front. Three with two. With one. Doesn't know. Did he get it off? No, we're going to over time. We are going to over time. The Rams defend in the half court perfectly and Kitchens didn't have anything to do. And VCU will go to overtime to get to the elite eight. - The overtime was just excruciating. Goes to the rim. That counts. - We had not had anything offensive happen for eight minutes. Then Bradford Burgess hit a three. A big one. This is Burgess. There it is. - Different guys took the lead at different times and we certainly needed it. Those runs are made out of moments like that, when the guys lift their game. Kitchen gets inside. That's too easy. Snaer. Steal by Rodriguez. And a foul. And obviously every point critical here. VCU. - Man you got that feeling in overtime thinking, this is gonna be tough to chew on all off season if we can't win this game. We left so many points at the line. - We played tough as nails. - But they came back on us, they battled back. They hit some huge shots at the end. - All game long we played perfect defense and we had one small... I mean he made a great ACC player he made a great play. Right side it gets to Singleton. Singleton drives the lane he's got a seam and an easy layup. With 29 seconds to go. Rodriguez and the Rams are down one 71-70. Rams have one timeout remaining and 23 seconds to play, and Mike this is it. Rodriguez angles to his left. Rams gotta get some kind of field goal. Burgess to Theus. Theus stripped got it back. 12 seconds to play. Theus to Rodriguez inside drive and scoops shot blocked out of bounds with seven seconds and now. If your coach Smart you call your time out, they do. - And now we found ourselves in a situation where at the end of overtime we needed to score. Ball was out of bounds, underneath our basket. - Now I was concerned we weren't gonna be able to get off a good shot because they were so long and athletic. And they had a condensed amount of time to really defend us hard. - I missed a lot of free throws in the end of that game too. And Skeen missed a lot of free throws and. You know I'm in the huddle, that last time and I'm ready to cry almost 'cause I think it could be over and I'm thinking about this moment like-- VCU's gotta end bound it, they do so with Joey Rodriguez. And then Florida State calls the timeout. - They called timeout after we had set up a play so we had to come back into a second timeout and organize a new play. - I honestly think those guys on the bench, there was a level of comfort. And the way that story the timeout unfolded with coach Smart telling Joey look 'em off, look 'em off, and them come back to him 'cause he's gonna be there. - At first they were supposed to run one play it was called 12, and 11's the same setup as 12, just a different play and he changed it in the second timeout. - They look at the alignment, they call it timeout. We come back in, we change the play, we go back out. This team trying to find a way to get this game to Sunday for the Rams, Rodriguez will baseline left. Rodriguez looking, Rodriguez has gotta get it. - It had to be the longest five seconds of my life. Man I'm sitting there, come on Joey you gotta get it in. Come on Joey you gotta get it in. - I was concerned that he was about to blow the whistle. I think on the radio you can hear me saying get it in, get it in, get it in. And I see to the screen and I see where there is a way that he could get the ball. But I'm not sure if Joey sees it. - It's taking forever, and I say he's gotta get it in. Rodriguez gets it inside to Burgess! Lays it up and in with seven seconds to go. Score! Seven seconds to play. We got the of all time man. Brad went up and it's like slow motion. It went in and had to hurry back on defense. - It just happened so slow. Like the longest five seconds of my life. - Joey, he had the ball for a long time. Is he gonna pass it 'cause I was the release man. You know Brad, he made a great basketball IQ play. You know he saw that they were switchy and he slipped the screen, Joey made a pinpoint pass and then like you know the rest is history. - Honestly I thought Brad was gonna miss that layup 'cause it looked like he was confused on if he wanted to dunk it or lay it in. - 'Cause I couldn't decide if I wanted to dunk it or lay it in but I'm just glad it went in. - And I look up at the clock and I thought, way more time should have went off than that. - There was a lot of time on the clock. There was still seven or eight seconds I think. The defensive's now gotta go for the Rams. Singleton to Kitchen. Kitchen with five, Kitchen with four. Kitchen right side with three. Drives, passes that to Singleton. Jumper blocked! Blocked! Blocked! Blocked! The Rams win it! They're going to the. Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! - Everyone was just kind of freelancing. I mean everyone lost their mind for a minute, me included. - I actually thought about jumping on the score table. But, I kinda like touched the score table and it wasn't really sturdy enough. - I grabbed the ball actually, and I threw it all the way down court and it hit a cameraman and I tried to act like I didn't know what happened. - I look over my shoulder at the crowd behind me and it's pandemonium. - And i looked over at our crowd and out crowd was just going wild and I just ran to the floor. - I mean I jumped up, I ran after Rob and then some people ran after Brad. Some people ran after Joey. Rob was like just running around the gym. I mean we were just too excited so I mean it was a really fun time. - That was the best moment of the tournament to me. - You're a competitive basketball player, athlete you dream of that finish and that's what was exciting more than anything for me. Our guys are experienced in what they probably dreamed out for a long, long time. It was the same for the coaches. It was awesome. - We've beaten the Pack Ten, the Big East, the Big Ten, and the ACC. Now, we get to play the only number one seat left, in the whole tournament. From the Big 12. Guys are we done? No. - Alright, alright. Well lets enjoy this one tonight. Then we're gonna quick turnaround and we're gonna win on Sunday. I'm telling you. We follow the plan we buying, we winning the game. Great job guys. Great job. Everybody bring it in. V! C! U! Lets go VCU! - You're thinking, okay this is just basketball. We're gonna to do the same thing we always do. But, our fans totally change it for you. This isn't about you anymore. You know, I mean it is but it isn't. You've grown. Lets say it that way. - When you go to Kansas of Kentucky or Carolina Duke. You don't plan for one weekend you plan for three. And when you're a mid major like VCU, I think you enjoy the moment. - So what you're about to witness is the VCU band, the Peppas about to go down the river walk, and we're about to play a bit of our music so. Hopefully the environment takes care of us and we take care of them. Not too loud not too ruckus. We're about to have a good time check it out. - Easily one of the best images from San Antonio has to be, the site of the Peppas, the VCU pep band on a canal boat floating down the canal wall. And to see the reaction, not just from the VCU fans, but from Kansas fans. The Florida State fans. The natives of San Antonio to see the VCU pep band coming down the canal in a boat just working it. Just absolutely blowing everybody up. It was fantastic. That absolutely to me, that's like one of the best images to see that pep band which was such a great symbol of the spirit of the Ram nation to see those guys and to see everybody kind of embracing them, applauding for them. That was really, really cool. The opportunity in front of us today is this, 40 minutes, it's about 70 possessions out of offense. 70 possessions on defense. Lets make every single one of them count. Today, we go after them, we run on them, and we lock them up. And today we're punching our ticket to the Final Four. Lets go! - You know I just kind of remember back to the Morris twins saying that Brandon and Joey you know before the game, the captains mean that hey you guys have had a nice run but it's about to end. Well, again our guys get highly motivated by things like that and they think they can play with anybody. And they've proven that they can, So why should they think any different. - It's Kansas, they're really good, they've been number one in the country most of the year. I think they only lost one game prior to that. Our guys, they didn't waiver them like man I don't know about this. But their approach the whole time, they were lasered in and locked in like they thought and expected that they were gonna win the game. - What concerned me is Kansas they were attacking us inside. And I was really bothered and I was really thinking we were just gonna get hammered, and just out sized and out physical and there's not much we can do about that. You see the strategy right off the bat. Kansas trying to VCU inside. - Of course they got off to an early lead. This time Marcus Morris scores against that press. - But I'll be doggone we didn't come back and just punch them right in the teeth. And here we go. Look at Shaka Smart he's like six on five. He's another defender out there. Where is VCU finding this energy? - And if you tell me that, believe in that or have any doubt that you're not gonna win. I mean it affects things. And I think all of us, everybody believes that we should beat Kansas and we should beat everybody else we played in the tournament. Rozzell. Hits the three, making a 17 for one. For VCU. - It's so fitting really, that Brandon would explode and make such big shots throughout our NCA tournament run. Because that's when we were at our best. Is when Brandon Rozzell was out there playing his game and attacking the basket and making three's. You know I think the emotional energy that he provided for our team when he played that way is off the charts. Three pointer for Skeen. Jaime Skeen showing the entire repertoire. There's Rodriguez for three. - Three's just start falling. Three's, more three's, more three's. And you're up 20 and you're looking at the scoreboard and you're like is this happening? After what happened with Florida State, overtime. You're gonna run Kansas out of the building. Three. The Rams racing down court. The toughest games in the tournament if you get all the way to the Final Four, the first one and then the elite eight. It's Rozzell, makes another one from downtown. And a stunning first half here in San Antonio. In a rare scenario, Kansas, trailing at the half. 41-27, and we go to Craig with Shaka. - Well we saw you before the game tell your team to get after them and lock them up. How good have they been in the first half by following directions? - I think really good. The first two possessions we let them lob over the top and score on us inside. But other than that, defensively we've been very good. We got a rebound much better in the second half if we wanna win this game. - You fell behind six to nothing, Kansas had the momentum, you didn't call time out. You're that confident in your team? - Yeah our guys have a lot of poise and we don't need to call timeout to come back. We're a resilient group, we're gonna need that resilience in the second half 'cause Kansas will certainly make a run. - I'm not gonna lie you know I was a little nervous. We knew they were gonna make a run you know. Coach told us that. And he told us you know you're still a great team. They got one run in them, a big run in so. We just gotta weather the storm and be silent. Well coach what does your team have to do to turn it around on the second half? - Well we gotta guard and we gotta get back in transition. You know they shot the lights out but we didn't guard them obviously didn't defend very well. They had us on our heels the whole half. We gotta get back to playing inside out and getting the ball between us and have another delivery. Defense will give 'em a few minutes. From Markieff Morris. Kansas contingent hoping that is the start of a virtue. - You knew Kansas was gonna make another run. And this is what Bill Self talked about. Play inside out, and they're putting a lot of pressure on this VCU team. Here comes the Jayhawks. Off the double. Nixon. Lost it. Ahead of the field. The lead is down to seven. A 7-0 run by Kansas, and now a technical foul on coach Shaka Smart who did not like the call against Ed Nixon. That is the first technical foul by coach Smart all season long. - You know when you get in the NCA tournament you have the best of the best of the officials and that Kansas game, we had a phenomenal crew. They're guys that... They're all stars in terms of officials. They are guys we would love to see a lot more often. But just felt like at that point the game was kind of slipping away. I didn't think our team was paying enough attention to detail. I thought we were letting Kansas be the agressor. You know it did feel like there was a couple calls that maybe should have gone the other way. So I lost it a little bit coming out of a timeout, and I said nothing. But they said that I walked out at too quick of a pace. It actually worked out well because it served as a turning point for our team and for me personally because I knew at that point, hey I'm not getting another technical, I'm not saying anything 'cause I wanna finish this game up. - You know coach Smart got the tech. So he was out there arguing with the refs and it was just the team in the huddle. And I just kinda pulled everybody together. I was just like everybody relax. I was like everybody we playing on our heels and we need to just come back and attack like we been doing all tournament. - Never seen Joey like that. He was just... He took guys you know, jersey collars like alright, you know lets regroup. This is the same game, this is basketball. You know same court, this is just Kansas you now. Don't look at the name on the front of his jersey. And I think after that we all calmed down and got to back to playing our basketball. - It's not easy to get guys to speak up in uncomfortable situations. It's something that takes time to learn how to do it takes a level of confidence, it takes some training but they slowly but surely got it. And by the time we got to March they really, really got it. To Reed, Reed gets it inside to Taylor. Six to shoot, Taylor's got a wide open dunk but he instead lays it in and scores it. Kansas has been amazing in the second half. - We knew they was gonna come out you know and making runs. We knew it coming. We just didn't know if we was gonna be able to withstand that. Taylor on the run, Rodriguez fire. Did not wanna pick up the foul. Might get the goal to, yes it counts. It's on Rodriguez, correct? That's 3,000 about a minutes time. I was a little concerned at that point. How coach and his staff and the players reeled the emotions in. I thought was brilliant. I don't that there's a strategy for that but they had the resolve which is something you hear coach say all the time. They had the resolve to not roll over. And everybody in that building thought they were about to roll over. Three point play for Taylor, the lead is down to two. By virtue of a 17 to 3. Kansas one. Outside pressure. Foul is called of that jump shot by Skeen and it's on Marcus Morris, that's his third. Three shots for Jaime Skeen. It's just a wonderful thing to see Jaime and not just play so well but the belief that he had in himself and that his teammates had in him is a wonderful thing. And you just don't see that on a lot of team. And it became very clear early in the month of March we're gonna give that guy the ball as much as we possibly could. And every time we did, seemed like something good happened. Morris drives the lane, he looses the handle. It's on the floor, picked up by Skeen. Turnover Kansas. Now Theus on the run. Theus still driving, Theus always up to the finger roll, Good, Theus gets the finger roll to go inside. Rams now leading 50 to 44. Six point lead for VCU. Theus top of the four reverses to Skeen. Open three, Jaime Skeen he got it. Bulls eye! Joey reverses it to Burgess. Take the three. Burgess spins inside. Burgess inside to Skeen. Skeen dunks it in as Jaime Skeen gets a wonderful look from Bradford. An 11th seed Virginia Commomwealth trying to knock off number one Kansas. 14 turnovers by the Jayhawks. Rodriguez from way downtown and way off. - Joey's the type that you knock him down once, he's gonna come back and he's gonna come back harder then he came back before. Gives it to Taylor. Taylor's gonna drive the lane. Double clutch layup, good he got. With 5:09 to go the lead is five. 57, 52. Another run run by the Kansas Jayhawks. - As a player you want to go out and play your game. You want to go out and have the freedom to shoot the ball when you're open. To make plays when you can and wanna have teammates that are gonna create shots for you and I think we really had the best of both worlds here. In that situation because very rarely do I tell a guy not to shoot. - Coach believes in and I'm just a confident guy and you know they did the same thing on the ball screen so I just pulled up and shot it. I think there was like 25 on the shot clock shoot. So I'm sure people in the stands were like no, no, no. Now top of the key, he squares and shoots the three, bulls eye! Rodriguez trains the tray. Joey a big three to make it 60 to 52. An eight point lead for the Rams. - The stat that I always remember is Kansas led for the first two minutes and 32 seconds of that game and that's it. They never regained the lead. They got it to two but they never regained the lead. You can almost feel America in the Rams corner. Rodriguez inside, kicks up top to Burgess. Four, three, yes! He hit it. 63, 54. Three. Two. One. And he scores. Once again it's the combination of Rodriguez and Burgess who combine for the winning basket Friday night against Florida State. Kansas switched on that play. - I think to me one of the greatest moments of that whole run was when that game ended. And I did, I was emotional and watching Shaka and knowing how much had been invested. It hits you, the raw emotion of that moment was something I'll never forget. I mean there was a sense of joy, a sense of accomplishment. A sense of wow and a sense of wonderment with what had just gone one and to know that we had just witnessed greatness it was pretty special. Here comes Kansas into the front court. Morning start for three with seven seconds. It is no good. Five seconds left. This is Reed in the corner with three, with two, with one. It's over. Shaka, Jayhawk. The Rams are going to the Final Four. They beat the Kansas Jayhawks. 71, 61. And deep in the heart of Texas we will be staying. The great thing about sports is, the families are such a huge part of it that it's their team too. And there's an investment level that is so very high and it's really a special thing that you don't see in other walks of life. - The neat thing about our guys, when we got in they were very thankful for the opportunity. They knew they got in and it was close and you know coach always talks about appreciation ratio against entitlement. Our guys were very appreciative of being in the tournament and in that situation and they just took full advantage of it. They really did. - You said all those that believed in you, a lot of people didn't believe but maybe they are now. - Well those people don't matter, the only people that matter is the 14 guys on our team. And they never stopped believing Craig. - Alright well thanks a lot. They go from the first four in to the Final Four. - The whole thing with the doubters, I remember talking to Shaka about this. I said I think our guys are starting to feel like they don't belong because of what all the people are saying. And Shaka didn't agree with that but I could sort of sense it with the team so once we actually accomplished all that I just felt great for them. I felt great that they were able to just shut all those folks up and just hey you know we were presented with a challenge and not only did we exceed you know everyone's expectations we did something that is historical. Gives us some credit. Think if I tell Shaka, I will be extremely shocked. - I will be extremely shocked. I will be extremely shocked if VCU beats Kansas. They were amazing. - They were amazing baby. They were amazing. Kansas shot so bad. You know you're in San Antonio. You're in a bubble to a degree. You're not at the Seagull Center, you're not in Richmond. You're out in middle of Texas, there's a lot of our fans are there but you don't know, it was almost like when we beat Duke. You don' know the impact because you're on opposing floor to a degree or a foreign floor and you're just not in Richmond. We heard before we were getting on the plane in San Antonio I man right when we were getting on the plane, Tim Latney was in contact with the police and they had set up a they said a command center in the Seagull Center. I thought what's going on back there. So in the entire time we were getting some messages on the plane that the Seagull Center had a couple thousand people there and that's gonna be really great. We get here and I was the first one really off the bus and I came down the steps and I walked out and they said it's packed. And I walk out and I said, you've got to be kidding me. What's going on guys, welcome back. - You just think about all the people that have been apart of VCU for decades. How much it means to them, young and old. That's who I kept thinking about. I couldn't help but be happy for like the hardcore fans. The fans who come time and time again. That's who I was happy for. - You know when we set out in this journey, our goal, I'll be honest with you, our goal was to make the sweet sixteen. It had never been done before at VCU. And these guys did it. And that will not be lost. We went down in San Antonio, we said, why not go to the Final Four. Now we're going to the Final Four and we're saying, why not bring the whole thing. - We want Butler. We want Butler. We want Butler. We want Butler. When we beat Kansas, things changed. We filled up three charter airplanes in basically 36 hours. And that was to me a signal that we were on to something. I've heard people who've lived in Richmond 30, 40 years say they've never seen the city come together. They've never seen so many people out cheering on VCU. They've never seen so many people openly show their support for a team in this area then they did for VCU in the NCAA Tournament. - We just needed something to cheer for, somebody to cheer for. I think that's what happened. I think people just naturally combusted because of what was going on. - I've been here since '98, there was a level of energy I've never seen in Richmond. Not the Richmond sports community in Richmond period. - I think the neat thing was that our guys whether it was the coaches or the student athletes, they did a great job of maintaining you know some humbleness and not allowing themselves to get caught up in it and think that they're rock stars. You know when we have really good guys on our team so even prior to the NCAA Tournament, a lot of people liked our guys 'cause they're fun guys to be around. It just made it more enjoyable for the fans and the students at VCU was because they go to class with Brandon Rozzell and they know he's a great kid and now they happen to cheer for him now on a national stage. Same thing with a lot of our players, I think a lot of people really enjoyed that. - Jaime Skeen. VCU. And welcome to the 2011 NCAA - Talking to local, regional and national media members that's what they found so refreshing. They were just being themselves. - Whether it's Joey beating Steve Kerr in a three point contest or that whole iron man drill that had literally the entire Final Four community talking. Shaka and his coaches taking charges and diving for balls. I mean but that's who they are. That's who the Rams are. When I walked into the stadium it was so, so big. And so many people. You know when you're an assistant coach you're sort of one of the foot soldiers so you're doing, you're not doing the media stuff. You're going on the next thing. What's the next scout, what's the next tape. Are we organized with and that, are our guys ready to play the game with all the craziness going around them. But I will say when I walked out for the Butler game for layups with the guys and I was standing there, seeing all these people and seeing the court raised up. That was awesome and I think why it hit me so hard is that when I turned around to look at the VCU section I saw my mom and my wife and my kids in a couple rows behind our bench and it hit me like we're here. We're in the Final Four. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Hello friends and welcome to Houston. And welcome to the 2011 NCAA Final Four. - Talking to some of my friends in the business they were like, you realized that only like one or two percent of people in the game, coaches, players, really get the opportunity to go to the Final Four is just such a unique thing and I never thought about it. Out of the southwest region, they are only the third number 11 seed to reach the Final Four. Please welcome the VCU Rams. - It hit me when I saw our players run onto the floor and the come up those steps you know 'cause it's an elevated floor. It's almost like being on stage. And I thought oh my goodness, guys come on don't be nervous. I was nervous for them because they looked nervous. And you know you know those guys as people and you see 'em run out on the floor and I'm thinking, oh my goodness. - I walk into the arena, stepping up to the steps, getting ready to warm up. I kinda hit you then and everyone cheers for both sides. You got Butler over here, you got Yukon, you got Kentucky then you got our section. It's just so much going on then you look up, you got the big screen and the camera over your head. It's insane. - You just kind like look around, you're like are you serious. Like we're really in the Final Four. When you get out there for a game now it's battle. And it's just like any other game whether it's here in the Seagull Center or on the road to the CAA. But now you're on national TV in front of millions of people, you're in a football stadium in front of 76,000 people and you just wanna go out there and do what you do as a player or as a coach. National semi-final is underway and VCU controls the tip. And that's where they'll be going, right to left. - It's a heck of a feeling you know to be on that kind of stage in front of those kinds of fans and you wanna play your best but you gotta stick to your game plan. Back to passing Smith, whips it to Mack. He shoots a three right in front of us, it's good. A three ball for Shelvin Mack. He's 79th of the year and the Rams down three, zip early on. - The pressure never got to them and I think that's a credit to coach Smart and his staff. I think they made it fun and they made it out that we have nothing to lose. Down low Mack. Great passing by the Bulldogs. And they were so loose and so confident and when those first couple jumpers went down and I thought you know what, we're gonna be in the national championship. Transition defense at the other end. As you look at Burgess who's been terrific all tournament. Reverses it back to Skeen. He takes a three point shot. Bulleye! Jaime Skeen The Rams are up by one. Let's fall into it so far. Another shot from the corner and it's another three, three in a row this time. - When I saw those shots go in I just knew we was gonna take off. I just felt like it was gonna be a game and we was gonna keep rolling and keep rolling and play for the national championship. Got an advantage, Skeen turns around shoots off the glass. It goes, Jaime Skeen. - I thought Butler would take stuff away. They took some stuff away but they couldn't take it all away. We had so many guys clicking. Again in the corner, it's open. It's Burgess. Man is he high above highland, he's got nine. He's at three. - It's a great basketball game. I think both teams, it was a game of runs. They had individual runs. Someone to take Looking at Marshall work that glass. Smith almost lands on his teammate then puts it up with a left hand. - First half they probably had a good eight to 10 points just on missed blockouts or them getting a 50,50 balls. So it was a lot of mental mistakes. The tree point shooting allowed VCU to jump out to a quick lead but then Butler has maintained contact by virtue of it's work on the offense. - Every game you hit a slump. Even in our best games we had a slump so I mean we expected it, we knew it was coming but didn't know it was gonna last as long as it did and it be so hard to watch and take part in. - We didn't make shots like we did throughout the Tournament we missed a lot of open shots, a lot of short shots. But Butler did a great job with their defense or game plan of taking away some of our things and taking away some of our better plays and our better ideas. That's Mack and back on the board, he had five quick ones at the start. - They're making tougher shots than we're missing. Mack takes the three and nails it. It wasn't a pretty game. It wasn't a pretty game, it was a lot of, it was like a bar fight as Kevin Garnet would say. A bar fight but it was a tough game. It wasn't pretty, it was you know make it happen any way you can. Howard, well he backed off leaving Rodriguez open. Off the floor it's Nixon pinned underneath. Oh how did he squeeze that one through. Drive it in, dishing it out. Stagul from the Corner. Got the steal, can't make the three. Power tips it over where we can retrieve it. Butler finished the first half on a 19 to 8 run and they lead it at the break by a score of 34 to 28. - You're gonna drive them under the rim. We're behind 'em sometimes and they're just driving us out. We gotta push 'em under the rim like we do in practicing, we gotta shove 'em underneath the rim. - Instead of trying to back 'em out. - Yeah instead of trying to back 'em out just shove 'em underneath. Take the angle. Yeah. I don't think it's so much open looks, we gotta rebound the ball better and we gotta do a better job running our stuff crisply. Open looks will take care of it's self if we do that. Reddic on the inside. And this is a good start for the Rams. The first five of the half. An excellent start Jim. VCU coming with great energy to start the second half. Reddic hits the shot and VCU takes the lead by one. First seven of the half, lead by Marshall and Burgess first foul. And back outside, Skeen with a three. Yes. Joey Rodriguez that's all him. Penetration attacking. Again you wanna try to tag three point shooters if you're Butler and make Rodriguez finish. He's got it. The sharp shooter. Going for two in a row, he's got it. Zach Hahn, another league change. - We continued to manufacture great opportunities and they would roll around and fall off. Tapped out and it looks out. - And yet we still continue to battle. Rodriguez bounces it in, Rozzell puts it up for the league. Back to the Rams. You know a lot of times you, in a game of that magnitude you see teams fall apart. Mack has bee quiet this half so far. Hahn drives in, goes the other side. He's got eight points in the last minute. On several occasions you know they'd go down to stick a tough one in and we'd come down and have a layup roll off. Inside it was an open lane and somehow it stood up there for a long time. Boy there's been a couple like that Jeff form VCU this half. Mack he's on the broad with a three. You know Shelvin Mack made a couple shots that you couldn't defend any better. Brandon Rozzell did a wonderful job on him. Ed did a great job on him but when a guy rises up and makes a shot, sometimes the guy just made a great play. Gotta tag him though. Mack way outside, he bands it home again. Stolen away by the Bulldog's. And he'll pull up here if they don't tag him. He's gonna take it to the hole. Puts it off the glass for two more. It's Mack time. You put the ball in your best players hands and go to work and he did that and that's why he's a very good player and you know we went to Jaime. He was our best player and he made some great plays too to keep us right there in striking distance. Probably look to go through Jaime Skeen or Bradford Burgess. It's their biggest deficit of the entire tournament. Not made a basket for three and a half. Skeen owns that streak. Well done. Mack fade away. Rattles home again. With Theus all over. Rodriguez. Sends it home for three. - You know Rodriguez hits a three, Darius Theus had a big layup. - They always had an answer. In the second half even late in the second half we had our chances and the shots we were making throughout the tournament we didn't make consistently against Butler. - I remember I had a three in transition that was in and out. I just smiled 'cause I was just like well. - It's definitely frustrating you know especially in the first half you think, okay it's happen to us in the first half so we're gonna have to regroup and come out in second half the same thing happens. You know shots go half way down, half you know come back out. And then Vanzan stuck one in. I mean it's like Michael Jordan shooting the ball. Are you kidding if this goes in and it went in. Yes. - And on our end of the floor, you know we're getting a layup that rolled off. A tip that hung on the front of the rim and rolled off. Threes that rattled in and out. Through out the year when we were one, two, three possessions away we found a way to get there and get a lead or get tied up or make it put more pressure on them. Especially with a big guy on him. Well he goes to the corner and Vanzant three! Huge three by Shawn Vanzant. And it's back to back to seven. And a timeout called by Shaka Smart. - Even if we missed a shot or we missed an easy shot underneath or you know we gave a second shot. We were always within striking distance and we never lost contact of the game. - They kept defending and they kept battling and then we got it back to four again. On the defensive end here. As Skeen puts up the-- And one we got a chance for the four point play. Hey it's not rocket science folks. Get the ball to your best player and see if he could do something good for you. - It's like the, you know you feel like again, it's destiny. It's gonna happen. Rams gotta get a stop here. This is it. With 1:15 to go, Rams have given so much guts in a 61, 57 game. Butler's getting exactly what they want in terms of the type of game. With nine on the shock clock here's Shawn Vanzat. Off the dribble penetration, left side. - They were not gonna be denied either. I mean it was the immovable force against the irresistible object and it was whoever got the biggest player or the biggest rebound was gonna win that game. The baseline fade away. No. Power with a follow up. The same shot into the game. You expect him to make a play like that but not at that moment you know we expected him coming into the game for him to do stuff like that but at that moment it just crushed us. - It still, it still kinda hurts man. Knowing that you were that close. Losing to Butler was a big thing. So it's like, I don't know the right wording for it but it'll always be there. No matter how much we look at the glory that we had, you still gotta think about how it ended. Howard had to back off. And still gets the rebound. And a foul against VCU. I think I learned a long time ago that sometimes the ball just doesn't go in. I mean it's that, you could draw it up and you can execute sometimes the ball just doesn't go in and when you see balls going half way down and not coming back down it does, you start to think like oh wow is it gonna end here. Is this the way it's gonna go. What a run it's been. They had to play that extra game in Dayton. One of the last teams in. The coach just his second year. That so many people criticized for even being a selection into the tournament. Boy did they justify their place. You know we didn't play our best game against Butler, some balls didn't go in that normally do for us. Some whistles might not gone our way. But I do think we went out there, we put our best foot forward, we competed, we battled. Think if a couple things go differently maybe we would have found ourselves in a national championship game, but I definitely think we went out there with nothing to lose and we gave it everything we had. - I mean we're thankful for making it that far. We put in maximum effort. We left it all on the floor. It was great being out there competing you know. - It was tough to accept that you know we weren't gonna be playing for the national championship on Monday night but then when you sit back and you look at it, you know you just had to be thankful. As the clock kinda went to zero and you know I kept looking back at the VCU fans to kinda see the reaction. And there were very few tears. I mean I'm sure that there were, but they were so proud. I think that the pride overwhelmed the sadness that they felt. The pride that they were there on that stage. They earned the place to be on that stage. If you ever wanted a standing ovation of 70,000 listen to this. The crowd showing their appreciation to the seniors who had an unbelievable run. - It was a pretty cool moment. You saw Butler fans cheering and Kentucky, Yukon and everybody There was coaches up there too and so I'm sure a few were in front of their TV's cheering. I felt like Rocky, the first Rocky. When Rocky against Apollo Creed. When Rocky lost the fight, and they cheered Rocky for his effort. For his heart. For his determination. For getting, for over achieving. So when we lost I said you know what, we maximized our potential. You know think about all the names in college basketball that have never had an opportunity to play in a Final Four. And yet our guys had that chance. They had their moment at the top of the game with the whole world watching and they earned it. - Now that it's over it's kind of like surreal almost. If you intend something with all of your being and everything you do is going towards that intention. And following through on that intention, then it will come true. And of course when you're part of a team it takes more than one person or two people or three people to intend success, to intend a trip to the Final Four. It takes a team full of guys and families to do that but that's exactly what we had. - VCU in this tournament knocks off the Pac-10, The Big East, The Big 10, The ACC and The Big 12 comes up short against the horizon league. - Yeah but they had a phenomenal run and you heard Shaka Smart talk about it. He hopes that his guys understand just what they accomplished. - What they did is flat out incredible. Him and his team should be proud of what they accomplished but I don't think, I mean what they really did is amazing. - Once again they don't think we can win but they don't matter. All year long we've done it for each other. We've played for each other, we've pulled for each other, we fought for each other. Get's it in. Get's it right side with three. Drives, passes out the single to jumper Can you believe the score. It's an 18 point lead over Kansas. It's over. Shaka, Jayhawk, the Rams are going to the Final Four. They beat the Kansas Jayhawks, 71,61. And deep in the heart of Texas we will be staying.
