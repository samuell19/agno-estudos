Film restored in 2013 from a stock internegative safety. The reproduction was printed in 1976 from a brown safety, itself produced from the original nitrate. The brown plus the original elements no longer exist. Along with 2K image transfer, sound was restored used the Synchro-Ciné process. One of France's leading sound systems, the technique post-synchronizes music, voices and sound-effects. While innovative, Synchro-Ciné remains imprecise. The 15 nautical miles of heavy seas that separate the isle of Hoëdic from civilization might as well be a 1,000km road. Thousands of rats populate the sandy land on this barren isle and sea winds ensure that no plant grows more than a few inches. In this Dantesque setting of breakers, swirls and fogs, 100 families of fishermen live in semi-famine for half the year when the fish don't bite. They have no doctors, judges, gendarmes or tax collectors, governed by a priest who is as poor as they are. What can the harsh land provide? Some miracle catch? Or maybe the chance to plunder the mysterious debris of a sunken vessel? The imagination of each islander conjures up a fortune from the sea that will make them rich. Such is the real background, the actual context in which this film was shot. No tricks or special effects, no counterfeited images shot in the studio, no actors. Alone, these tough Breton islanders present The Gold of the Seas. SYNCHRO-CINÉ presents THE GOLD OF THE SEAS A film by Jean EPSTEIN Cameramen: Christian MATRAS, Albert BRES Original score by TH.
