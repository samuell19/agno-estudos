Ooh! I can't wait to try on my new school uniform on. I'll put some cakes out for you to take. You're gonna be the most popular girl in the school when the children taste my baking. Hey, nice shoes. The bells! The bells! The bells! Imagine if your mum looked like that. I don't… You'll feel better after a nice cup of tea. I've forgotten the milk. I could go to the shop we saw 'round the corner. On your own? Hiya. Hello. I haven't seen you before. What's your name? Um, lona. What's your favorite animal? Uh, I like dogs. What's yours? Uh, I like cats. Yeah, all right. What are you thinking about? Those kittens. Love you, Dafty One. Love you, Dafty Two. What do you think? Where's that brandy? It's good for upset. But I'm not upset, Dafty. Today's the day I get to meet my new friends. Where are you from? I don't know. I was abandoned as a baby. And this old hunchback lady found me in the forest and looked after me. Abandoned? Hunchback? She loved me and raised me. And then, one day, she walked me to the edge of the forest and set me free. Don't worry. We'll take care of you. Oie, new girl. Have you sucked cock? Probably. Probably? Have you been fingered? 'Cause we need to know so we can decide if we want to be friends with you. Or not. How many fingers can you take? She doesn't even know what fingering is. She's a mummy's girl. Yeah. True. She's definitely a virgin. I'm sure. Yeah, that's right. I've been thinking about you all day. Haven't we? I really liked Chelsea and Stacie. But Keely's my best friend. And they really liked your cakes. There's more where they came from. What did you do today? Did you go to the Community Center? I… I didn't… I had to leave your brother. Look at him. He's still unsettled. We'll struggle with this one. I've warmed your dressing gown for you to put on. Keely asked me to go 'round to catch up on schoolwork. I won't be long. Mm. Aw! So, uh… Have you got a boyfriend? No. The girls at school wear makeup. Aren't they a bit young to wear makeup? They look really pretty. I think I might like some. Makeup gives boys the wrong impression. One sign of lipstick, they behave like animals. I bet you'd look really nice in makeup. Night, night, Dafty One. You forgot this. Thank you. I'm gonna be in the air for a couple of days, so don't forget anything else. I promise. Have fun. Your mom is the best! Oh, my God! My mom's sewed a name tag into my shorts. I'd bitch slap my mom if she even breathed near me. What's up with your face, piggy? Is it upset, 'cause your mom is your best friend? And her lover. Two pigs together. Oink, oink. Did you see that? Don't you? Who's this now, Budgie? Who's this? Have you got some ladders that I could borrow? Yes. Yes, yes, I have. Come… Come in. - Do you want to come in? - Um… I've got… Would you like a piece of fruitcake? I've got some in the cupboard. It's a bit dry, but, it's very nice with whipped butter on. I'm busy. Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry… There you go. That's that. - That's it. There you go. - Thank you. Thank you. I think I might have made a bit of a friend there, Budgie. You've been busy. A friend from across the road just borrowed the step ladder. I'll do the rest when she brings them back. You made a friend? And I've been barn dancing. It's a bit like lipstick. I've got to nip out in a bit. Again? Well, Keely asked me round to help her with algebra. When I told her how you taught me, she said she wished her mum was as clever as you. Well, I suppose it's only right that you help her since she's been so kind to you. I'm 18 soon. I'm having a party at my house. Um, you're invited. Really? You can see my bedroom. Iona? Do you know that woman? She looks like the village idiot. I just remembered I've forgotten something. So… Are you in the bathtub, dear? Mom? Mom, what are you doing? There we go. All finished. Do you want to have a look? You'll have all the men in all the land after you now. Hmm? Didn't know you had a boyfriend, babe. Aw, is it another phantom boyfriend, babe? Daz who? Fantine. Oh my God. He's like an insignificant. Sometimes I wish I was an insignificant. It's easier. Iona… Let me do your makeup, babe. Oh, sorry to bother you. I was, um… I'm sorry, I was just wondering… Um… I was just wondering if you'd finished with the ladders. And I brought you this. I made it myself. Thanks. Bye, then. See you soon. Bye. You can look now. She looks amazing. She looks orange. So, the Holocaust took place from 1941 to 1945. It was a mass genocide, which means lots of people were killed. Oie, lona. Six million Jews were killed under very brutal circumstances. She is fit. It's got a name in Hebrew, Shoah, which means "the catastrophe". Keely Johnson. Yes, babe. Being as you clearly don't need to do any work, babe, you can explain to the rest of the class what the Holocaust is. Is it a ride at Alton Towers, sir? Carry on with your work. Iona… Come and sit with us, babe. Move over. Iona. Pets. Doctor. Council. Numbers are adding up, Budgie. "Stevie Babes." "Do you have questions about the afterlife?" Do you have questions about the afterlife, Budgie? You all right? You look nice. Thanks. Can't wait till four o'clock. Well, I promised Keely I'd see her and the girls later. So… Keely Johnson? I didn't know you're mates with her. Yes, babe. Hey, what about tomorrow? Together, together, together, together. Together, together, together, together. Together, together, together, together. Together, together, together… What have you done to yourself? Oh. I'm… I'm sorry. I'm sorry to bother you. But, um… I was wondering, um… Have you finished with the ladders? No. Only, I was in the middle of decorating when I lent them to you, and… Well, if you were still using the ladders, why did you give them to me? Uh, I… Well, it… My friend still needs the step ladders. So I'm getting creative. You say something? Doesn't matter. Is your mom as pretty as you, lona? She's much prettier. She's an air hostess. Oh! I wish my mom was an air hostess. Me, too! Have you ever had an orgasm, babe? What, you mean like in biology? That's "organism". Arthur! Can I have a go? Leave it here and wait. Good, eh? Do you wanna skive? Feels funny without Chelsea and Stacie. Sometimes it's nice not being with them. All that giggling does my head in. I bet you loved to move into a new place, didn't you? Yeah. Especially since I met you and the girls. The thing is with living where you've always lived is you have to act how everyone thinks you're gonna act. If I moved to a new place, where no one knew me, I'd be totally different. I wouldn't muck around at school. And I'd be nice to my mom. Yeah, but wouldn't you miss having a different cock in your mouth every night? Two cocks, you mean. What are you doing? Well… I thought maybe this room could be my room. Yeah. Carry on. Um… I'm gonna need my own space now. Now that I'm dating. Budgie. Bu-Bu-Bu-Budgie. When's your big date again? Friday, seven o'clock. On the dot. And I'll be home late. Well, that's a shame. I invited all the girls around on Friday evening. Right then, darling. Have fun at your party. Thanks, Mum. Oh, my God. Does your granny live here as well or something? Hi, come in. You all right? What is this? Iona, meet Sicko, my cousin. You all right? This is exciting. Does that thing ever shut up? Give it some whiskey and chill it out. - Don't. - Do. It might fall off its perch and give us all a laugh. What are you doing? It's not good to keep it locked in a cage all day, is it? He's so funny. I saw this film on YouTube where some girls ate some birdseed and it made them horny. I want some. Hmm. Well, have you got any? Yeah, I think so. Honestly, they were so off their faces they kept flashing their bits. Hurry up with that birdseed. - Oh, shit. - Iona. Your bird has broken a beautiful ornament. It's just knocked another over. What you doing, you dickhead? Oh, fuck off. Budgie went a bit wild. Is it working? Is it? Fuck. Oh, my God. I actually feel really horny. Give me some. Oh, my God. I actually feel lush. Me, too. Are you horny, Chelsea? Yes. Are you, Sicko? I'm always horny. Good. 'Cause lona wants you to shag her. Don't you, lona? Shit. Sicko, you fat fuck. I'll buy you a new one, lona, I'm sorry. Are you all right, lona? Put it back in its cage. It might come around. Come on, mate. I know. Let's play flip and strip. Iona, babes. Heads or tails? Tails. Ooh! - Heads. - Yeah! You'll have to take something off. Get your top off. Get your tits out. Get your tits out. Get your tits out for the lads. Take a sock off. - Oh, God! - Oh, my God. Only a sock? A sock? Come on, man. That one sock though. It's a pair. It's tails. I'll be naked if I take anything else off. Boys have taken more off than you have. Uh, what are you doing? I'm gonna go home early. I've got a little foster brother, so… I don't want you to go. Sorry, babe. See ya. Bye. Bye-bye. Chicken bitch. Fuck her. Come on, then, lona. I knew she'd do it. Oh! Heads or tails? It's not my turn. Sorry, you wasn't quick enough. Come on. Rules are rules. Oh, my God. She's actually gonna do it. Oh, my God. Ha! Got ya. Hi, this is Keely. Leave me a message. Hey, babes. I keep texting you. Can you text me back, please? Thanks, bye. What you doing? I'm going to see the girls. Hello, and good evening. My name is Stevie Babes, and I am the people's psychic. My friends, I was at an event like this last week. A young man came to me, in spirit. My friends, this young man had hung himself. Because he was being bullied. His parents were in the audience, hoping for a message. Indeed, their son was there. Because he's always there with them. He never leaves their side. And this young man told me since being in the spirit world, he'd never been happier. Whereas the bullies were miserable… and consumed with guilt. I asked his parents if anything nice had happened to them recently. And then his mum said, "We recently got double glazing." I said, "Your son sent you that double glazing." My friends, there is no such thing as death. Only transformation. You've had your struggles too, haven't you, Mama? There's a big, beautiful, fluffy white cat that's on your lap. That cat has chosen you, because you have an infinite amount of love to give. Let it flow, my love. Let it flow. And feed that cat. You made out like we were boyfriend and girlfriend, and then you… You treat me like shit. I didn't mean to. Sorry. She was ringing me all weekend. - I didn't answer. - Oh, she's coming. Hi, babes. I've been trying to get a hold of you all weekend. Oh, sorry babes. So, as we see, words and language evolve. Can anyone give me a recent example? Yeah, Keller? MILF. Mothers I'd Like To Fuck. Okay, thank you. Anyone else? Yes, Keely. Frenemy. When you're, like, friends with someone, but really, you hate them. Yeah, good. So I want five different words from everyone. And I don't want to see you with the same answers as the person next to you, okay? Go. No way! Hey. What's going on? Keely and Stacie sent those photos of you around. When you stripped. Sent them where? Everywhere. Why would they do that? 'Cause they like making people unhappy. Hi. Keely and the girls bought you these. Said they're sorry. I thought later maybe we could do a jigsaw together. Where's your boyfriend? I liked your photos. Iona! Iona? You were out late. Were you on another date? Here. Oh. No, it's mine. Leave it! What are you doing with my phone? Hey. I waited for you at the pond last night. He's seeing Keely now, babe? Didn't you know? You don't mind, do you, babes? Of course not. I'm Lyn. My daughter's a sexual maniac and I need some friends. It's my fault, because I used to… dress up and go out at night and hope I get raped, so I could have a child. So I could have someone. This is a friendship group, not a freak show. Linda is right. This is a friendship group. Sounds like you might need a support group. Or a belt. It weren't meant to be like this. We were meant to be a success. But I'm that useless that I can't even get my step ladders back from my neighbor. I'll give you your step ladders back… if you'll do us all a favor and throw yourself off them. Excuse me? Excuse me. Um, I'm studying psychology online, and I could help provide you with the tools to avoid things like… like your ladder situation. I'm leading an assertiveness session here on Thursday. It'll be a safe environment with less than a handful of people. Should I put your name down? What are you wearing to Daz's party? My fuck me dress. What about you? My fuck me shoes. I wonder what lona's gonna wear. A cushion? Nothing, 'cause she's not invited. Can I see you tonight? I thought you were seeing Keely now? That was my twin, silly. It's "bring your twin to school" week. Isn't your twin here? Iona, too! Come and sit with us. We were just saying how we like you much more than your twin. Can we keep you? Actually, I've got a confession. I'm lona One, not lona Two. Oh, my God! We really thought you were your sister. You've made us remember why we loved you so much in the first place. Let's all be best friends again. Okay. Super. Can I stand with you, please? What's it worth? Pretty good. Our language, both body and vocal, plays a large part in how we communicate ourselves. So, Lyn, would you like to get up and stand where I am? I was just wondering if I could have my ladders back, please? No. That's fine. So you just… look her in the eye, if you can, and saying… say what you want to, again. I'm sorry. I just really need them. Tough. Why won't you give me my ladders back? Because you are an ugly freak. And every time I look at you, It makes me physically sick. Keely? Is it Keely, isn't it? I'm lona's mummy. Thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. Hello. You left this at the community center. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Um, we've all had a chat within the group, and everybody agrees that you don't really fit in. And we think that perhaps you might not want to come again. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Of course. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you come sit with me, please? I'd better go in a minute. Mum's making a chili. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty… Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty… Gate-crasher alert. What did the waitress say to the camel? I don't know. What did the waitress say to the camel? "One hump or two?" What have I done to make you so horrible to me? Excuse me. I'm the victim here. I'm the one who had to look at your ugly mother. Just you fucking wait! I'll fucking kill her! Open the fucking door! Now! I'm gonna kill you! You bitch! Let me in! Don't worry. I've killed them, darling. Come on, darling. It's gonna build an intensity. But you can only say certain things. So you can only say, "Yes, you will." And you can only say, "No, I won't." Okay? You ready? Let's give it a go. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. Iona? Are you okay? What are you doing? I missed you! Look, just… Go home. Yeah? What's this about you having your hands on my boyfriend? You don't even like him. If you don't get down to the pond right now, we're coming to your house. Mum… I was thinking… maybe we could move again? Why would I want to move anywhere with someone who's got a reputation? Here's the slag. Come quick. Them girls have got lona. It's all right. I've got you. You're safe. It was an accident. We were having fun. And your party? Please stay with me. I'll never, ever leave you. I'm always, always with you. I want my ladders back, please. - But I've not fin… - I want my ladders back, please! Give me back my ladders. Hello? Uh, Keely? It's… It's lona's mummy. Um, lona told me and the police how… how brave you and Stacie were, when you saved her from those thugs. I wanted to… Well, I'd like to give you some money as a reward.
