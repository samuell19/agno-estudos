Castlegard. Clear! - 250. - 250 ready. Clear! - 300. - 300 ready. Clear! He's gone. It's over 100 degrees out there. He grabs me with ice-cold hands. Apart from external wounds, everything is out of alignment. Even his veins are out of alignment. Now, wait. Look at the heart. The aorta doesn't Iine up. And now the spine. Same thing. Same shift right across the third vertebrae. This guy Iooks Iike a paper doll got cut up and pasted back together. No wallet. No ID. Just this thing around his neck. It says ITC on it, so we called them. - That outfit in the desert. - Our biggest contributors. Excuse me, gentlemen. Frank Gordon, ITC. I'm here to pick up Vince Taub's body. I'm Dr. Cova, I'll take care of that paperwork. Thank you. Vincent Taub, huh? That's Vinnie's good-Iuck charm. Thank you. Pretty sad when your time comes and no one claims you but your employer. - Excuse me, Sheriff. - Sure. Gordon. I'm picking up the body right now. - Was he alone or with Decker? - Taub's the only one here. - Get the body out of there. - And x-rays and records. Get everything, OK? Will it be a problem? No, there's no problem. They've been very accommodating. If this gets out, ITC is ruined. Any idea how he ended up in the desert? I don't know. Maybe he used his marker without enough clearance. - It could be a million things. - Not too bright. He's dead, Robert. Taub is dead. Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way, what's Castlegard? I heard that's the only word he said, "Castlegard". Sounds Iike an amusement park. Listen up, dass, April 4, 1357, Castlegard, France. The English army in their red uniforme occupied the village of Castlegard. The French, meanwhile, were advancing. Trying to drive them out of there, in this direction over the river, past the monastery and up and over to the heights here. Just Ieave it, Chris, that's fine, before you wreck the place. The English army, meanwhile, had retreated to Castle Ia Roque. Welt fortified, very streng, very weil supplied, and both sides had settled in for a Iong siege. The French were trying to push the English out of France. Lord Oliver tries to take the fight out of the French. Now, he has a prisoner, a woman. A woman of dass and a woman of nobility. CommanderArnaut's sister, Lady Claire. He hangs her from the battlements for all of the French forces to See. Instead of demoralizing the French, it whips them into a frenzy, and they attack the castle Iike madmen, and they overpower the English with sheer passion. So the fortress of Ia Roque fell in one night because of the death of one woman. Lady Claire. AII right, that's enough of the academics for today. Go get your hands dirty. Hi, Chris. Hey, Dad, I got Marek's clippers. Oh, Chris, great. Thanks. Here, hold that, will you. You can move it around if you Iike. - I thought this would be a routine trip. - lt is. Last time you cut off your beard, you sold the house and we moved to Kentucky for a year. - Your mother wanted a change. - How does this always happen to me? I am older and very much wiser than you, Have a beer. It'II cool you down. Very hot work, ironing. I know something's going on. The beard's coming off, so what's really happening? It's these amazing finds we've been making. Doniger's been giving us too many tips. - He's a Iucky zillionaire. - Nobody's that Iucky. He knows something he's not saying. Something isn't right about this. He's been ducking me. I'm gonna get a few answers. Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks. Put that in my bag, would you? And don't wrinkle it. I'd appreciate it if you don't tell anybody about this. Especially Kate. - Why would I tell Kate? - Here. Have a wee run round that, would you? "Why would I tell Kate?" You See me twice a year, stay until you're bored to distraction. I think the record's three weeks. Maybe I'm just really beginning to enjoy archeology. From a boy who hated Easter because he had to find eggs. - Yeah, because you buried the eggs. - That's beeide the point. You're still here because of Kate. Chris. Look,son, I Iove you, but you're scorching my shirt. Sorry. You and Kate are from different worlds. You saw how that turned out between your mother and me. Yeah, but, Dad, no offense, I'm not Iike you. But Kate is. Trust me, 'ü Ws between archeobgy and you, youfllose. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. I brought you a beer. - That's so sweet. - Half a beer anyways. Half a beer. - What you got 90mg on here'? - The Steins. The ones you were talking about? Where do they go? Now they don't go anywhere, but they'll Iead me to my tunnel which will go all the way to Ia Roque. What do you say I help you out? Show me what to do. - I thought you hated this stuff. - No, I don't hate it. Let's have a beer, I need a break. - You have the full one. - That's sweet of you. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Think you'll follow in your father's footsteps? - No. - No. No way. Actually, I'm not really all that interested in the past. No? What are you interested in then? I think I already know the answer to that question. I've been hoping that you'd notice. I've been hoping you'd quit hoping I'd notice. So there's nothing there? - Chris, you are the boss' son. - So... there is something there. It's Iate, I'll just Start on this tomorrow. But thanks for the beer. - Haven't been practicing, have you? - I'm not getting any younger. - You Iove this stuff. - It's a habit I can't quite kick. Let me take that from you before you cut something you'll need Iater. So talking about Iove. - How did it go last night? - lt didn't. So how does it feel being passed over for 600-year-old ruins? Itsucks. It sucks big time. I don't understand you guys. You live in the past. You know what the past is to me? The past is why my parents split up. The past is what I've been force-fed since I was Iittle. None of you archeologists Iooks to the future. What are you talking about? What is the future but just more of the Same? More gadgets, more machines Iike that thing you rode up on. It's the past is where it's at, you know. People then, they cared about each other. - Men had honor, you know? - No, no. You know what that is to me? Romantic warrior crap. Romantic? You want to See romantic? Follow me. Come on. Come on! What have you got? Oh, another stone sticking out of the ground. No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus with a French knight and his Iady. - Look, isn't she beautiful? - She's a real knockout. Very funny. Another thing, down here, they're holding hands. - Incredibly unusual for that period. - That is kind of unusual, huh? Oh, God, over here. This knight has only got one ear. What happened there? What, one ear? That piece is missing. It's somewhere here in the dirt. I'm the archeologist. lt was carved that way. - Fair enough. - Trust me. Who do you think they were? Why would somebody that doesn't give a shit be concerned with that? - Because I'm intrigued, all right? - See? - What you wanted to hear? - Yeah. We're all intrigued by this. That's why wäre all here. It's not just about the rocks and the rubble. It's about these people. Who were they? And what were their stories? It helps us to understand where we came from, or where wäre going. - You know what I Iike to say. - "You make your own history." - Do I say it that often? - Yeah, all the time. Welt, whoever they were, they made theirs together. It's best to go really, really slow. It's better to be cautious. Come on. Hurry up! Cave-in at the monastery! Cave-in at the monastery! I was Standing and the floor gave way underneath my feet. - How Iong has it been open? - 15 minutes. We have five minutes before oxygen contamination. - Let's move 'ü. - Be carefuL. - It's under where I was working. - I don't know about this. Can everybody listen up? Let's be careful, we got that? I've got your back. Be safe. - Who's going in first? - OK, let's go. - Who's going down first? - I am. - On belay! On Kate! - OK, take me down nice and slow. - Give me a radio check. - Please be careful. - OK, one-two. Do you read me? - We're good. That's good. Just keep it steady. - Lower Kate down. - Lower me down. Easy, QUVS- Nice and slow. Nice and slow. I'm getting close to the first Ievel. - Easy! - Bring me down, guys. - A Iittle more on Marek. - Smell the stale air. Kate, be careful down there. I'm down. Oh, my God. This is right below where I was working. Are you all right? What's going on? "All right?" "All right" is not the word. - One... - Give me slack on the rope. - More slack! - Come on, guys. - Oh, my God. - This is unbelievable. We are the first people in this room for 600 years. These... These... are beautiful. You won't believe the condition of these... - What have you got? - Come here. No way. This is too much. Oh, my God. - What is it? - Oh, my God. An old document box. We've got an oilskin with documents inside. - Look at the condition of this thing! - OK, let's be really careful. Quick, get the bag. - I can't believe this. - That is gonna be such a find. Careful, careful, careful. Let's get this up. I need the Iight for a minute. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, man! - Give me the Iight. - What kind of... - It's amazing. Son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful? Obviously not an archeologist. We've gotta get out of here. Let's go! Guys, wäre coming up! Pull it up! Come on! We want to go up quick, OK? - Hold this. - What are you doing, Marek? - It's OK. - What are you doing? It's definitely a modern-day bifocal Iens. I know. And bifocals weren't invented until the mid-17003. The hole only opened up today, Stern. There's been nobody down that chamber before Kate and I. If you think that's weird, you'll Iove this. - What is this? - One of the documents you found. It's just a simple Iist of the things stored in there. Nothing special. And then we found this. Look. The professor? "Help me"? "E.A. Johnston"? - "4/2/1357"? - 1357. - E.A. Johnston. - What is going on? I cross-matched the signatures. It's definitely his handwriting. But he's only been gone for two days. Your father wrote that, but he wrote it 600 years ago. What's going on here? Frangois is looking for his spare pair. I'll See if the prescriptions match. So you're telling me this is the professor's and it's 600 years old? - What have you been Smoking? - Maybe you can explain. Ifl knew, I'd explain it. AII I know is that the ink is 600 years old. I know. This is my father. This is him. - He's just playing a prank. - No! No, there is no way he would risk contaminating the site as a joke. He just wouldn't. - Did you carbon-date the ink? - Of course. - There's got to be another reason. - I did it three times. Like I just said, your father wrote that note, but he wrote 'ü 600 year's ago. I don't care about ITC's policies, I'm his son. I wanna talk to him now. I found the professor's glasses. They were on his desk. It's a perfect match, Look. We should do an optical test to make sure. I'm sick of this. Either somebody tell me where Professor Johnston is or I report a kidnapping to the authorities. Have I made myself clear? Just tell us when and where. What is it? Doniger's sending a plane for us. We're going to New Mexico? Let's pack Up, QUVS- Good morning. Steven Kramer, ITC. Frank Gordon, security. - Where's my dad? - You'll See your dad shortly. - Where's Doniger at? - Doniger's waiting inside. - Mr. Kramer will explain everything. - Tell me. How come we have a 600-year-old document - with his handwriting? - Pleading for help. I'll explain as soon as we get through security. ITC is constantly advancing itself in science. 30 years ago, the business world was revolutionized with a machine that sent documents anywhere with the push of a button. Donigefis Vision was to do that with 3-D objects. - Like a fax or something? - Exactly. He's trying to send actual objects from one place to another? - Follow me. - But that's impossible. He would need a quantum Computer with millions of processors. We used them to build a machine that could fax three-dimensional objects. I'll explain these mirrors Iater. lt would put FedEx and UPS out of business. - You actually made it work? - Yes. Across a room. But we wanted to send things across continents so we built a bigger machine. This is the prototype. The prototype? So that thing that we just passed... - Exactly. - ...is the real thing? We gave it a thousand times more power. We tried to send something from New Mexico to a twin machine at a Iab in New York City. Now, here's the interesting part. The package never amved at 'ms desflnaflon. A few hours Iater, it showed up back here. Wait a minute. So if it went missing between New Mexico and New York, - where did it go in the meantime? - We asked the Same question. So we sent out a camera over and over, and we got back photos of the Same location, a hillside with trees. That's when Mr. Doniger made the brilliant decision to point the camera straight up. So once we cross-referenced star charts to the horizon, we realized that the camera was not only in the wrong place, - but it was in the wrong time. - So, what does that mean? The camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near Castlegard, France in the year 1357. So you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel? No, we accidentally discovered a wormhole. A wormhole that seems to be Iocked to a single time and place in the past: 1357, Castlegard. So you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 14th century? No, Chris. Yourfather is in the 14th century. What? - We need you to help get him back. - Mr. Robert Doniger, this doesn't make sense. A wormhole is a volatile force. You can't send a person through one. Can't fit a piece of paper through a telephone wire. But you can send a fax. Sure, once you've broken the message into a stream of electrons, but... - Oh, shit. - Now, look. I don't care about the hows or the whys. I care about my father. Did he know about all this? I thought we could help each other. We'd give him hints about the best excavation areas, and he could discover why wäre Iocked into this particular place and time. So this is why you've been funding our dig. He was more astute than I thought. We gave him too many clues and he became very, very suspicious. How could you send him there? God knows where he is... Oh, he's a very persuasive man. He insisted on going. - Now he's Stuck. - That's where you all come in. Do we look Iike wormhole specialists? You sent the professor to the Hundred Years' War? - Right. - Turbulent times you sent him to. We need cultural experts, not scientists. My people don't know about the medieval world or how to mingle, which is what we have to do if we are to find the professor and bring him back. So we bring him back, it's that simple. We step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back? Once he's broken us into a stream of electrons. - Why should we do what you ask us? - I think we need to know more... - I know you have a Iot of questions... - A Iot of questions. The professor's already been gone for 72 hours and every minute he's there, it'II be more difficult to find him. - That's true. - Bob? Excuse me, I need to get them changed if they're going to go. - Frank, change with them. - I'm not going. - Gomez and Barette are ready. - We need to think... - I'd Iike you along. - We didn't say we were going. Steve, can you bring them to prep, please. Sure. Folks, this way. Thank you. Please, this way. Thank you. Just follow Steve. He'll take you to the prep room. Bob, look. Gomez and Barette are my two best men. They can handle any Situation. I would prefer not going. I really want you to go. And if you See Decker, you know what to do. Robert... You know, that was a really great speech you made. I almost believed it myself. - Didn't you forget something? - What? Come on. Look at Taub's MRis. Look at his arteries. This was his tenth trip. This is their first and only. They deserve to know that we don't know how he ended up in the desert. You don't think they deserve to know that? I've told them enough. How did my father get Stuck back there? Doniger gave him an hour. Things got harried, and I lost him in the woods. - You Ieft him there. - We have a Iimited time. I had to come back or we'd both be Stuck. I guess it's better him than you, right? Listen, there's a few things we have to go over before we Ieave. They need your vital data. It's for your return process. Change from your clothes into those clothes over there. Anything you want. Put your personale in the lockere. I want to introduce you to two friends. Bill Barette, Jimmy Gomez. They're coming with us. Buddies from the Marines. - Why do we need Marines? - Just in case something goes wrong. I Iike to have all my bases covered. AII right, let's change up. I can't believe you're considering this. Do you understand what it does? It strips you down to a molecular Ievel. Which means, for a moment, you cease to exist. - Listen to him, he's got a point. - Hold on! Wait a second. I don't need you, Miss Ericson. Or Chris. - I need you. You know the Iayout. - Nobody knows it Iike I do. - I go. - There's no way I'm not going. I just said I'm not going, so don't touch me! Thanks. Stern, we don't need you back there. You're a physicist. - Your knowledge won't help us. - I'm sorry. But we are going to need you, Frangois. - Why d0 we need mm'? - Because he speaks French fluenfly. - He's right. - My high-scheel French sucks. - Don't do this. - We need his help. - I'll cover you. - Don't pressure him. Frangois, you have to make your own decision on this. Your father would've done it for me, so, yes, I'll come. - OK. - Yes. Thank you. Thank you. - Magnetic coils ready. - Verifying now. Platform up. Computers are up, Mr. Doniger. Tell Gordon we've got to get going. Keep a couple of beers cold for me, all right? Mr. Stern. Watch our backs, OK? It will be all right. We'll be back before you know it. - Take it easy, bro. - You know the 50 bucks I owe you? AII right, let's move it. Frank, six hours and the clock is running. Wear these personal markers around your neck. You can use any one of them to Call for your return. Frank will explain their intricacies once you arrive. Most importantly, one marker will bring all of you back. - Do not lose them. - What about weapons? Nothing modern goes back. Especially weapons. - They're set for a six-hour Countdown. - Countdown? - They burn out after six hours. - And then? I'll get you back before you know it. Oh. Sorry, Frangois, they didn't have these back then. I don't See without... You'll be fine. That's where we goofed with the professor. I feel morally compelled to inform you that there is a degree of pain. I'm told it's rather intense, but extremely fleeting. A couple of seconds. No residual discomfort. So forgive me. I didn't want that to influence your decision. - OK. Good Iuck. - Let's do it. You all look great. Miss Ericson, you look divine. Good Iuck. Don't worry about it. You guys will be home for Iunch. - Think of it as the ultimate field trip. - A fantastic thing for an archeologist. - I can't believe wäre doing this. - Slowly. There are no railings. Josh, come on down. Come watch. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Take a place around the perimeter. - Spread out. - Move around the platform. Take a deep breath, relax. We'll be back before you know it. - Are we Set? - All Systems check. Come in, Josh. Close the door. - Good Iuck. - Six hours and counting. Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek. I need you to take your position. How's everybody doing? - What the hell are we doing? - Getting the Chance of a Iifetime. Nothing to worry about. We'll take care of you. Just relax. Everything will be fine. - DNA streams Iocked in. - Thank you. - OK, Iock them in. - Locking in. - How Iong does it take? - A couple of seconds. Watch it here. Mirrors Iocked. Son of a... Where is he? Frangois! - Are you all right? - Where's Frangois? Frangois? - There he is! - Frangois! Pull him out! Now we wen. Give me your hand! - Come on! - Frangois, hold on! Hold on! Hold on! - Here, take my hand. - You all right? You all right? Everybody all right? That was a close one. AII right. Let's head up this hill. Everybody follow me up. - Hell of a Start. - We've always arrived on land. - Gordon, is this it? - I think so. You think so? Are we in 1357 France? - This could be Oregon. - Gordon, where are we? Shutup! Trust me, wäre in 1357 France. - Welt, if this is France. I'm home. - Come on, let's go. Let me explain the markers. Press here, it Shows the remaining time. Squeeze it, it takes you home. Butdonü. - Why? - We haven't found his dad yet. One last thing... - He said, "Hide". Everyone hide. - AII right, take cover. Let's go! Move! Now! Frangois, come on! Welt done, Sir De Kere. - After him. - Yes, my Iord. Get the others. Find out who they are. Come on, quick. Oh, God! Barette! We got a field buck! They're coming back! - Oh, my God. - Get a medic! Get a medic up here! - What was that? What was that? - What? What is that? That's a grenade! Get down! Oh, my God, he's Ieft. Get down! He'll see you! You! Over here! Let's go. Come on, come on! AII right, let's go. Come on, Chris! Kate! Marek! Hey. - Where's my boys? Where's Marek? - The guys came after Barette. He took some arrows and then he pressed his marker. He's gone. He took two arrows, and he must have hit his marker. - Where's Gomez? - I didn't See him. Oh, my God. Don't look. - What are you doing? - Oh, shit, I Can't find his marker. You're Iooking for his marker? He's dead! - What are you doing? - I'm getting us out of here. - We're not going anywhere. - We can't save anyone if wäre dead! - Keep it quiet. - You can't do that. Why not?! You need 40 feet of clearance around all sides to work. - What? - I was trying to tell you. Don't lose these. They're precious. And if you follow my Iead, I will get your dad and get you home. - Frangois, it's going to be OK. - Let's find Marek. - What about Gomez'? - We can't d0 anytmng about 'mm now. - We gotta go. Look atme. - Frangois, come on. Be quiet! The soldiers! You passed us. You passed us in the woods. It's OK. It's OK. - We've lost the trail. - Damn it. - Pick it up again. - Yes, Sir De Kere. Search down by the (wer. Jesus, you're a girl. It's OK. After the French bastards! After them! Leave none Iiving! Careful. - There you are. - No. Help! Help! Shut it off! He knew not to take anything modern. That son of a bitch brought a grenade back with him. I can't believe it. The coils. The coils. Damn 'm. He knew the regmaüons, n0 modern weaponsA! - Gomez? - The Iines are online! - Welt... - His marker. - What happened to the rest of them? - Get a medic over here! - I don't know. - Give me your gloves. Welt, did anyone try to come back with him? I don't know. I know as much as you, OK? Hang on. What if they're trying to come back now? - It's not gonna happen... - Don'tjump to conclusions. You can't leave seven people Stuck back there! - Tell me you have a backup plan... - Shut up! I don't know. I don't know. Please tell me you have a backup plan. Yes, we have a backup plan. G0! Gordon! Gordon! It's Marek! Chris! This Frenchwoman will Iead us to Castlegard. Great. That's great. Let's go. Come on. Wow. The village of Castlegard. We're here. Where is everyone going? Hold on a second. - What day is this? - Marek... It's the fourth of April. - Of course it is. It's April 4th. - 1357. - The day Ia Roque falls? - Wait, wait. - What are you talking about? - You son of a bitch, - Excuse me? - You brought us back on the day the French attack. By tonight, this whole place is gonna be burned to the ground. Stop with the history and look for the professor. Now, follow me. Let's go. I'm a physicist. Give me something to do. I can help. - Might as weil be a pharmacist. - Good one, Robert. - Replacement panels are on their way. - How Iong will this take? Five hours and 27 minutes. How do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes? Because that's all the time we have. Once this platform is fixed, even if the markers run out, we can send someone back to get them? The thing holding the wormhole open is their markers. But you've opened and closed it dozens of times. - Once the platform... - Look, we don't even know what we did to Iink us to this wormhole. A Iucky calibration, Chance impurity in the coils. The point is, the grenade probably destroyed any possibility of re-creating it. Once their markers expire, they could be Stuck there forever? - Is that what you're saying? - They could be. Guys, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, this way. Castle Ia Roque awaits its soldiers. - The manor house. - Look at {hat. I can't believe it. We were just working on it. That's Castlegard, all right. It's different. That right section, I had wrong. - Where did that tower come from? - What if my Dad's in there? - Yeah, you're right. - How are we gonna get in? Guys, soldiers coming. - You there! - Come on. Why aren't you packing up? - Run! Run! - Halt! Stop! - Go, go, go, go! - Don't Iet them get away! Get that horse out of the way! M)' lordg - Pick him up. - Come on, my friend. - Who are they? - We captured them in the village. I am Lord Oliver. Who speaks for you? - I do, my Iord. - You speak strangely. Yes, we are Scottish, my Iord. Scottish? You've come to kill us all in our beds? First the old man and now this group. Why do the Scottish find this village so pleasing? - It must be your Iord's kind manners. - Indeed it must. My Iady. - I beg your pardon, my Iord. - Let him speak. - My Iord, the old man you spoke of... - Edward De Johnness? He claims he's a magister. - Do you know of him? - He's our master, sir. - AII is weil with him? - He said he was alone. We were several days behind him. He does not know we are here. Who are you? Yes, you. The one whose head is touching the ceiling. Frangois, my Iord. A Frenchman. Hold. Please. Please. We're all gentlemen here. He's our interpreter, sir. Forgive them. I'm at war with the French, as weil as the Scottish. Have I forgotten anyone? The Spaniards, am I at war with them? Arnaut has sent many spies into my midst. - No, he's not a spy. - No? - He's our friend. - I'm sure he is. He's too tall to be a spy, anyway. - Interpret. - Be quiet. Interpret. - I'm a spy. - I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that. - It means... - Be quiet, Frangois. I am a spy. My God, it's a miracle. A quiet Frenchman. - Did you hear that? - No. Louder, boy! Come on! I am a spy. I thought so. - Oh, my God! - Get rid of the Frenchman. Put them with the old man. We may need them. Who's next? - No! - No, Chris! Don't! Don't! Oh. Frangois. Frangois. Inside! - Up! Move it! Move it! - No! Don't push me! - Hey, Ieave her alone! - Move it, ease on! - AII right, you bloody Scottish! - Hold on! I'm moving! Over here, Andre. This way. Come on. My marker. Guys, I lost my marker! Don't worry, we only need one marker to get home, OK? - This Can't be happening. - Careful with the rest. Those bastards killed Frangois. Professor. Professor! - Kate? - Yeah. - Kate. Oh, my God, Kate. - Are you all right? Oh, my God. You got my message. Chris, your dad. - Chris is here and Marek's here. - Dad? - Son. - Dad. - Chris, my son. - Glad you're still alive. Oh, God. What happened? - You've lost such blood. - It's not my blood. It's Frangois'. He's dead. Oliver had him killed because he's French. This guy had a sword and he just ran him through. Professor, what happened? I was trying to avoid the English, but they found me in the monastery. I convinced Oliver I was a magister on my way to Dublin. I skipped Shakespeare. What is a magister? - It's a scientist. - He accused me of being a spy. - How did you survive that? - I promised Oliver a new weapon. What kind of weapon? A liquid fire so intense that even water couldn't harm it. Greek fire? You promised him Greek fire? Professor. I'm sorry, have you considered what you may have done? You've given the English a serious advantage in this battle. - They're supposed to lose the war! - I was alone! - Marek. Marek! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. The point is, when these guys come here, and take us up to Ia Roque. When they seal that place off for battle, there is no escape. We're as good as dead. - No, we gotta get out of here now. - Wait, Wait, wait. Remember that field where the peasant huts were? That's the closest place with enough room to use the marker. - How do we get there? - We have to do it fast. - We've got four hours. - Four hours is plenty. The way I See it, we've got 650 years of knowledge on these guys. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get home in 20 minutes. - OK, let's find a way out. - Let's look around. There's a hole here big enough to climb through. - Quiet! - OK, all right. She was with the group we caught earlier, my Iord. May I ask why you're trespassing on my Iand? Come, come. - What are you doing? - Here's What I'll do: I'm gonna scale down the wall. When it's clear, I'm gonna Iet you guys out. - AII right. - You're not going anywhere. What? I am, I'm... Marek, I'm the best climber, I am the best climber. If anyone should be going, it should be me, but those roof slats won't hold me, or you, or you, Chris. - No, no... - Wait. Wait. But they might hold you, Kate. Now, Kate, this isn't a game. Are you prepared to take a Iife? I'll do what I have to do. There's no way. You're not going anywhere. It's going to be all right, OK? There's one thing worse than dying here, and that's Iiving here. I refuse to do either. I'm going. It's OK. She's right. Kate. - Please, please take care. - Hey, it's easy. It's gonna be easy. Chris, I need your help. Come on. I need you to hold that back and keep it open. AII right? - Kate, be careful. - OK, here I go. - Easy. - There's guards there. I'm gonna go up and over. - There's a window on the side. - OK, watch yourself. L QOt YOU! I got you! Hold on! Hold on. I got you. Don't Iet go. - Are you OK? - I've got a foothold. - We're gonna pull you back in. - No, I'm good. - OK, please be careful. - I've got to keep going. You, man! Gather those children and move! AII clear on the outside. Hold your Iine, men! In position! Too much als. We'll play again when I get back. Keep them quiet. - What the...? - Now! Grab a weapon! - Let's go, Chris! - Very sorry. We're heading out the way we came in, all right? Marek? - Marek! - Yeah, yeah. You go ahead. - I'll take the rear. - AII right, let's go! Kate, we gotta go. Oh, be careful! Let's go! Come on. Let's go! Quiet. You guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you. - What are you doing? - Listen. - Are you crazy? - Let's go. - I got my marker, I'll catch up. - Come on. - Where is he? - He'll catch up. He's got his marker. - Robert! - Yeah? DNA streaming should be online... now. - Got it! - Fully functioning? - Yeah! - It's a Start. - Don't move. Don't say a word. - Traitor! Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me? Shit! For God's... Jesus! Scotsman! Stop, it's me! Stop! What? What are you saying? Ax! Give me the ax! And help me watch for the wall! Move that stuff! Put it against the door! - Help me! - Get out of the way, woman! Get out of the way! Please! Come on! There we go! G0! Guards! - Who is that guy? - His name is De Kere. Come on. Quick, let's head back to the river. Get more guards! - We're not going without Marek. - I don't give a shit about Marek. My Job was to get the professor. I can't take care of you. I lost Gomez, Barette. You guys are on your own. Or follow me. Let's go! To the river, quick. We have a field buck. Somebody's trying to come back. - How streng? - It's minimal. - What does that mean? - lt means they're still alive. Halt! Come on. Come on. Where is he? Where's Gordon? Where's...? - There he is. There he is. - I saw him. Come on! - Wait. Watch it. - Chris! Drop your weapon. OK. Go. Oh, Sh“. - Come on! - Gonna Ieave us Iike you Ieft my dad? - People are Iooking. - There's no time. - Listen. Listen. - Everybody is Iooking. - Be quiet. - Kate, hit your marker. Press yours. I'm not going without Marek. - Hit your marker. - You're not going anywhere. Marek's got his own marker. Search every building and every farm! - Oh, shü. - Kate, press 'n. We Can come back for Marek. Press it. We've been here too long. - Press it. - It's not working. - It's not working. - I know how to do this. - Why isn't it? - I don't know. - If it were working, we'd be home now! - Everybody, walk away slowly. Let's find a place to hide. Infantry, spread out. Search the huts! Search everywhere and capture them! Oh, by the way, my name's Andre Marek. Castlegard was your village, wasn't it? - Don't worry, you'll return there soon. - No. The English will burn it to the ground before they move to Ia Roque. - No, Ia Roque will fall too. - Yes. But it will take many more Iives and many months of fighting before it happens. The French built that fortress. We know how streng it is. Ia Roque will fall tonight. Only a prophet... or a fool could make such a claim. In your case, it's probably the fool. Whichever makes you smile Iike that. Are you... married? No. We've been fighting the English since before I was born. There's no time for marriage. Of course. Are you with... anyone? - Am I with anyone? - Yeah. I'm with you. I know. I know. What I mean is, is there someone...? Is there someone that you See? - D0 I See? - Yeah. Nobody. lt is possible they are hiding on the shore or in the woods. They could be anywhere. Oh, God. You know, it's funny, but wäre speaking the Same language, but you don't understand anything I'm saying, do you? Get them! No, no. It is good. They are French. They will help us. - You're Lady Claire. - Lady? I Iike that. It's charming. Dame Claire. Fire! Fire! Find them! I killed that man. I've gotta live with that. - In here! - We found them! - We found them, my Iord! - Over here now! - Come on! - Don't Iet them go! Come on! Go inside! Go around the back. - Shut up and move over there. - Come on. - Burn it. - No. - No, you can't do that! - Don't. Chris, please get out of there. Chris! Chris! My son's in there! Chris, get out ofthere! Hold your man. No! No! AII right, come on. - Come on. - Chris, wait up. - Come on. - Wait up. - Claire! - Arnaut. He is very grateful you returned his sister... - You're English. - No, I'm Scottish. Arnaut, he saved the Iife of one of your men. - You're Scottish, huh? - Yes. In that Gase, I do not know how to express my gratitude. Welt, you can. Just keep her close and keep her safe. - I can take care of myself. - Yes, that's obvious. Please, do not Iet her out of your sight, especially tonight. Do not worry, she will be weil protected. I must Ieave. I must return to Castlegard to search for my friends. I need to ask you perhaps for a horse and a weapon. You will not make it alive through the English Iines. They are moving from the village to Ia Roque. We attack tonight. - You must not go back there. - I must try and find my friends. I'm sorry. Very weil. I will give you what you ask for. - Thank you again. - Thank you. - Lady Claire... - Claire. I wish we had met at another time. Andre Marek. Are you married? No. Arnaut? Arnaut has dismounted, and he's with his sister. Welt done. In fast, kill Arnaut and out. And may God be with you. AII right. I have to get inside Ia Roque and find my dad. - You'll never make it through. - I'll find a way. There is no way. You'll get killed. Oh, Jesus. Go, go. - I don't have a choice. - Yes, you do. There's another way. - What, the tunnel? - Yeah. You never found it. You don't know it exists. - There's always been a rumor. - Yeah, but that's a rumor. - My dad's Iife is on the Iine. - AII of our Iives are on the Iine. Look, if that tunnel ever existed, it's going to exist now, 1357. I know it's in that monastery. I know it. I wanna save your father as much as you do. You have to trust me, I know it's there. I know it. You've got to trust me. Stay in Iine. - Move along. - Keep the pace! Kill Arnaut! Claire! Claire! Claire! Move along! Come on, Iads. That's Marek! Marek! - Marek! - I'm OK. It's Chris and Kate, Marek. - What about Chris and Kate? - They didn't make it. - They've killed them. - What? Been a while, hasn't it, Frank? Oh, my God. I thought you were dead. Right, that's why you sent Taub to assassinate me. Not to assassinate you, to bring you home. - Right, just Iike you are. - No, look... Listen. - Listen to me, Will. I need your help. - What's this? Look, it's not working anyway. It says here you got Iess than one and a half hours Ieft. - It doesn't work. - Bullshit. Look, you've got to believe me, it wasn't my fault, OK? - I've got a family. - Yeah? - You've met my family. - You got a family? - You have a family. - I've got a family. - So did I! - No! ' N0! - - Oh, shit! - Oh, my God! Last time I saw him, he was running with his marker for an open space. I was on the ground, three arrows in me. I used to be William Decker. ITC employee number 273. Now... I'm Sir William De Kere. Lord OIiver's aide-de-camp. You Iooked pretty impressive today, Marek, for an academic. - How do you know my name? - I know all of your names. We read every report out of your dig before we made the first trip back. How many times have you been here? Enough to know transcription errors intimately. Transcription errors? Doniger, that son of a bitch. He hasn't told you a thing, has he? What are transcription errors? Mistakes in the DNA reconstruction process. - It's Iike faxing a fax. - Distortions. Mistakes. Onw the mstorfmns aren't 'm the Katers. It's body parts. The Organs. I've gone in too many times. I'll never survive another trip. AII that damage, it can be repaired, but not here. And not in this time. You'd have to go back. Why don't you press the marker? We can all go home, Decker, huh? My name is De Kere. This is my home. Lord Oliver awaits his Greek fire. After that, your survival depends on your knowledge of history. How good you make me look. I rise in favor, so do you. I fall, you fall. Marek, where's your marker? De Kere, Decker, whatever his name is, he took it off me. Oh, God. We're friends of Edward De Johnness. - Edward De Johnness. - The magister. He's my father. - The Engüshmen have harmed mm'? - We don't know. - We were gonna ask for your help. - Yeah, we need your help. Come. We need to hurry. We don't have much time. Lord Oliver demands a demonstration before nightfall. It would be best not to miss the deadline. They've done it. The stufFs all there. This stuff's a bit coarse, but it's good. What am I talking about? I can't do this. I can't give them Greek fire and influence the course of history. - I may already have done that. - What do you mean? When we first arrived here, we were helped by this girl who took us up to Castlegard. In fact, that's who I went back to get when we escaped. That girl turned out to be Lady Claire, Arnaut's sister. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I've delivered her to the French for safekeeping. She's incredibly important. Her death rallies the French to win. - Don't you understand'? - Keep n down, 0K'? Now we have to be on OIiver's side just to stay alive. This is exactly where I was digging. This is it. This is the place where... We're here. We're... What do you mean? This is the chamber where I was working. - I'm sorry, what did he say? - The army of Arnaut is ready to attack. - We're running out of time. - Those are the stairs. It's under here. Move them up here. There's a goodly number oftrebuchets, my Iord. What's a little fire to these stone Walls? - There's nothing down here. - This is it. This is the chamber. This is where the hole was. - We came down here... - There's nothing here. Marek would've been working there. The box would've been... Oh, my God. That is the box. That's the parchment he wrote on. My father's glasses. - Yeah, we've got to go. - No, no, put it back. If we don't find this, in the future wäre never gonna find your father. Put it back. We still gotta go. We gotta get up to Ia Roque. No, the stone relief was damaged. Somebody had damaged it. "What kind of son of a bitch would damage something so..." lt was me. It was me. I was the son of a... What is she doing? Wait! Get back! Stay back! Watch out. Watch out. Oh, wow. It's the tunnel. It's the tunnel! Give me a torch. Hey, give me that one, Kate, watch out. Let me go in. - Get Arnaut? - Yes, getArnaut. Go. - Please, hurry, Hurry. - Kate, get in here. - Oh, whoa. - You 901m? Yeah, I do. Careful, boys, this is Greek fire. You can blow us all to hell here. Smooth and easy, now. No spills. That's good. - Trebuchet! - Trebuchet! Sh“. - You OK? - Yeah. Hurry, there's no time. - Trebuchet! - Trebuchet! Trebuchet! Bring water! Lord Oliver, the magister with your demonstration. Oh, yes, I'll See it now. - Understand, my Iord, I've never... - Show me now! - Show him! - Your fire of the Greeks. - Marek, fire it! - OK, come on, let's move it. Trebuch et! Just fire the damn thing! I cannot fire it. Fire it! - Fire! - Ready, fire! Out of the way. Move. Let me pass. That's 'ü'? So you betrayed me. You promised me Greek fire. I should have had you hung... - What? - With your permission, my Iord. The more water, the more fire. Good. Bette r. My God, you are a magician, not a magister. I want this for every cannon. How many men will you need? - Twenty. - Twenty. - Give this man 20 men. - As you wish. This way, magician. Archers to the battlements! - Archers to the battlements! - Archers to the battlements! - We have 81%. - No, no. It's over. I'm not gonna play with their Iives Iike this. We can't get 100% efficiency from patched-together coils. What's the safest minimum percent? - We've done successful tests at 80%. - You just said we have 81%. - They were inanimate objects. - With reflectors up. - How much time do we have? - 28 minutes. No room for error. - They could be deformed. - Can we? - Yes, we can. - It's too risky. You think I'm gonna Iet you Ieave them? - Think I want to? - I don't think you care. They have a Chance, some kind of Iife. No, you lost the Chance for that decision a Iong time ago. - This is no Ionger your decision. - You know what? lt is and I have. I'm sorry. - Fire the moat. - Yes, my Iord. Fire the moat! - Light your arrows. - Light arrows. - Archers, prepare. - Archers, prepare. - Streich. - Streich. AWay! - Night arrows. - Night arrows. A Iittle surprise for the French. - Ready! - Streich. AWay! We're close now. We're close. I know it. Great. Welt done, my Iord. Trebuch et! One more of them, and we become history. Oh, no. No. We're going. FonNard, right maybe. Maybe it's just... Or we could go up, right? We could go up. - Kate... - No, don't. No! No! - Kate. - No. Kate. Maybe we missed something. Maybe we made a wrong turn. - We could... - It's too Iate. It's just too Iate. I said trust me, and I've Iet you down. And I've Iet your father down. And... - I've Iet everybody down. - No. - Oh, God. I'm so sorry. - No, you didn't. Kate, come here. Kate, come here. Come here. Come here. - Close the inner gates! - Close the inner gates! - This is growing tiresome. - The courtyard is secure, my Iord. Good, but this Frenchman needs to be put in his place. - It's time. - Captain! It is time! Robert. Thirteen minutes Ieft. Let's try and get them back. Are we gonna go over all this again? What are you doing? What the hell do you think I'm doing? I'm protecting our interests. - What's happened to you? - How many Iives are lost on the cutting edge of discovery? - It's the price for great advances. - These were kids, not astronauts! - I know! - They had no ideal Even worse when they're deformed! You know the media. They'II twist it around and Iabel it a "death machine". - It has a serious flaw! - And you'll fix it. - No, I won't. - Like you fixed everything else. - No. - What? - You won't? - No, I won't. I can't believe you'd just throw away your place in history. - I already have, wäre cycling up. - Think you can go behind my back? Huh? Kramer! Kramer? - Make the prisoner ready. - What is your will, my Iord? - Back to work. - Secure her to the battlements. I want to be sure the French can See her. At once, my Iord. - I'll give your brother a choice. - Oh, shit. - You are to be tied to the battlements. - What? Either he Iays down his arms or he kills you with his own weapons. Let us hope a man who stoops to using his own sister as a spy still has some sense of decency Ieft. God be with you, Iady. It's her. It's Lady Claire. I delivered her to Arnaut for safekeeping. - How did the English get her? - It's history. Then history will change. Oliver. Release Lady Claire and bring her down to me now, or by God. I will destroy your arsenal. - Marek! No! - Get the hell out of here. Go now! Halt! For God's sake. Ifthat thing blows, it'II kill us all. - Bring her down. - No! Do not touch her! My Iord, if he drops the torch, he then kills her too. He will not do it. Back off, De Kere. Or Decker, or whatever your name is. I will blow your arsenal to hell! - There's no way out. - You're English. - No. No, no, wäre not. - You're English! This is a trap! - Run, my Iord! - Marek! - You are working for Oliver. - No, wäre not. I will kill both of you! Down! - Yeah! - Yahoo! Be careful, my Iord. Archers, to the battlements! Here. - Hold the Iine on the east tower. - Oliver! Kill her! Now! - Arnaut! - Claire! We've got to find the others. Don't! Hold your Iine! - Dad. - Chris, you're alive! Kate, thank God! - Where's Marek? - I don't know. There goes Marek. There's Marek. It's OK. It's OK, Claire. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. - What are you doing? - Open the gate. Chris, stop! - It's solid. - Let me get up. I've gotta get up. - Can you? - Yeah. This is for France. - We gotta get out of here. - Where's Marek? - I don't know. - He went after Lady Claire. There. N0! My ear! My ear! It's me. It's me. - It's not working. - Welt, it's broken. - OK. - I gotta get Marek. De Kere took ms. - You guys run to the field. - Not without you. Kate! Run to the Center of the field and wait for us. I'll get the other marker. - Dad, go with her. Go! - Be careful. Over here. Marek! Chris, I thought you were dead. Your marker! Let's go! De Kere! De Kere has yours. Stern! Open this door. Where's Kramer? Where's Kramer? Shit! Take me home. Please. G0! - It's working. Be careful. - Come on, let's go. - Marek, come on. - Get out of here! We got Iess than a minute! Let's go home, come on! Come on, let's go! Let's go, man! Come on, they're waiting! - Go. Get the hell out of here. - No, let's go home! I am home, Chris. Chris, just go. Say goodbye for me. I'm gonna miss you, Marek. If you can do it, then do it. One more minute. Eighty-one percent, OK? - What's he doing? - The coils. - Come on! - This is good here. - Wait! - There he is. - Wait! - Come on! Where's Marek? - He's staying. He's staying. - Let's go. - Push the marker. - I am. I'm getting a field buck! Someone's coming back! What? No! - No! - You gotta... I don't have a marker. I'll never get home. Where's Marek? And Frangois? - Hey, Dad. - Yeah? Hey, Kate just called from the monastery dig. She finished excavating the sarcophagus and wants us there. - Wanna drive? - Yeah, I'll drive. Look what I uncovered. If Marek had come home with us. What would be written here? Oh, my God. "Andre Marek. "With his beloved wife, Claire." Oh, my God. "Loving parents of Katherine... "...Christophe... "...and Frangois." Dear Frangois, "To my friends who survive me, "I have chosen a wonderful Iife. "Died 1382." Born 1971. They made their own history. Together.
