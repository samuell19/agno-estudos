I just wanted to let you know your dad's looking for. - Oh, am I in trouble? - You never, but if you're interested in some trouble, I could introduce you to a club in town. It's wild on the weekends. - I don't date my coworkers, let alone another coach. - I could quit. I could quit like right now. - And double my workload? Don't you dare. (coach groaning) - steven, I'm gonna tell your mom. (door chime) - okay. Hey honey, I'll be with you just one minute, okay? - Take your time. - Which brings us to the final moment in our countdown. And the number one tennis meltdown of the year - shane loves a good countdown - is no surprise, william campbell. A true maestro of the meltdown, dramatic displays of emotion are his specialty. - Code violation? Code violations for what? I've had enough of you, I'm gonna have a fit. (crowd booing) what? Oh yeah, kick me out of the game. Kick me outta the match, do it. I got dinner reservations in 15 minutes. - Or at least they were, when he was playing. William has all but vanished from tournament play the last half of the season after a series of brutal losses, causing many people to wonder, is the bad boy of tennis done with the game? - What a mess. - Yeah, I like watching him play though. He's so gifted. - Yeah, gifted with anger issues. (laughing) - so I have a favor to ask. - Yeah, I can give you free tennis lessons. - Oh please. You got all your best moves from me, young lady. - I think mom would disagree. - I bet she would. - What do you need? - I was hoping you'd say a few words at the fundraiser. Public speaking was always your mom's thing. It's not really mine. - I'd love to. And for the record, you're my dad. Any favor you ask me is an automatic yes, forever. - Oh, thanks honey. - I gotta go. I'm back to back till dinner. - You work too hard. - Yeah, tell that to my boss. - I'll get on that, yes. - Morning, everyone. - [kids] good morning, coach taylor. - It's gonna be another hot one today so make sure you have your sunscreen on and you have plenty of water. It's never too late to hydrate. When you're ready, I want to see some laps. (bright music) four hand top spin, aim for the cones, you tell the ball where it's supposed to go. - Again, what am I doing wrong? - You're hitting down on the ball. Remember aim low to high, finish the stroke across your shoulder. (bright music) there you go. Excellent, argen, really nice. (bright music) - okay, that was a killer serve. - It's not nice to sneak up on people. - You still got it. - What would you know? It's not like you're ranked top 10 for doubles. - Nine, but who's counting? Hey. - Are you the ashley wong, the tennis star? - Well I'm ashley wong. - Coach taylor, could you take a photo of us? - Of course. Say rally. - [both] rally. - You know, you really should be taking photos with coach taylor here. Did she tell you we were double's partners early on? She was way better than me. - Really? I didn't know that. - No, not really. - Don't be so modest. If you hadn't left the game, we could be the team to beat. (car horn) - your mom's waiting. She may think I'm a mean coach who doesn't let you leave. You here for georgia sun? - Have tournaments, will travel, especially if it gives me a reason to see you. - Did you find a new partner or? - I gotta duck out for this promotional thing. I will tell you over lobster tails? Seven, usual place? - Perfect. - We have a lot to talk about. - Okay. (bright music) (phone ringing) hello? - [ashley] ugh, I am so sorry but I got held up on an interview and I haven't even left yet. - Oh no, really? - [ashley] yes and I'm so far from the restaurant that even if I left now it will take forever. You know atlanta. - Oh, do you want to reschedule? I just got here and... Whoa, you'll never guess who's here. - [ashley] who? - William campbell. What are the odds? - [ashley] well... - Don't tell me. - [ashley] surprise. Really kinda wish I could see the look on your face. - Ashley. - [ashley] it will be great for you guys to meet and he can fill you in. He's my new partner so play nice. - Yeah. - [ashley] and call me when you leave. - Okay, bye. - Hey, taylor, it's nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. - Yeah, same but not from ashley. I saw you on sports now this morning. - Ah, well you can't believe everything you see on tv. - It was literally footage of you. - That it was. - So what's the bad boy in tennis doing playing mixed doubles? - Because I can. - I followed your career, series of broken rackets from stadium to stadium. - That's not true. Our ball boy would do a better job than you and he told me that he needed glasses earlier. I'm sorry, was that in confidence? Oh yeah, yeah, you think that? You're out of the christmas card list and I write the best ones. - Thank you, we're gonna need more wine than that. I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty. This is actually one of the labels I do print ads for, you know, I kind of have to just in case someone puts me on the, yeah, the gram. - Well, ashley's not gonna make it. - No, no traffic, right? - Yeah. Are you gonna tell me why I'm here? - Well, ashley and I have been doing some practice matches and we haven't been exactly clicking. I don't think it's a big deal. - Yeah, of course you don't. - Well, ashley's fantastic, you know? So I figure eventually we'll just gel. - What does your coach say? - He quit. - Not how ashley phrased it. - Okay, I fired him, he wouldn't listen to me. - Generally, you listen to your coach. - What? I've been doing it wrong all these years, that's sarcasm. What else did ashley tell you? - You lost four coaches in six months. It's a big deal. - Tournament's still six weeks away. - You mean only? Still haven't told me why I'm here. - Well, it would seem like ashley has found a solution. - Oh great, what is it? - You. It's gonna be great, yeah. We should get one of those celebratory seafood platters with the dips. (cinematic music) - are you insane? - [ashley] we're out of options, literally. We've gone through the list. - I don't think being your last choice is the selling point you think it is. - [ashley] I don't know why william is suddenly into playing doubles, but my agent thinks this could be a good opportunity for me. Don't think about him, help me. At least watch us hit, give us some pointers, and if you don't want to take us on, well, at least we tried. - I'm gonna call you when I get to the car. - Sorry that took so long, got recognized in the bathroom, always awkward when that happens. - Yeah. Well, thanks for dinner. I would've split it with you, but- - oh yeah, no, don't worry about it. - Anyway, nice to meet you. Sorry it's not gonna work out, gave it a shot for ashley. - Well, I'm gonna give it a shot. I'm gonna give you a tryout tomorrow. - William campbell doesn't try out. - He just talks about himself in third person? - On second thought, maybe a tryout's a good idea. - Great, see you at the club at 8:00 am sharp. Bye. - William campbell looks forward to it. - Well, I texted him. - Is he always this late? - Am I late? - You know you're late. Let's just get started. William, this is my world class dad, david. - Hi there. - And this is juan carlos, he works with me, he's a talented coach. - I am? - Absolutely. - It's a pleasure to meet you but I thought today was gonna be a private coaching session. - The guys agreed to do a friendly match so I can see how you and ashley work together. - Don't play friendlies, never feel real. - They're taking time their day to help us. So just try not being yourself for an hour and let's do this. - Oh, ouch. - I can't coach you if I don't see you play. - Hey look, it's always been a dream of mine to play with a champion, so come on, indulge me. - Sure, let's play. (soft tense music) (players grunting) ashley, cover the court. - Oh yeah. - Ashley, cover the court. I'm sorry, old william, old habits. - Outside of that, do you know why you guys lost the point? - Oh, well I moved early, I guessed wrong but she wasn't there to cover it. - There's no way I could get to it. - Because? - Because I had no idea which way he was gonna go. - Exactly, you didn't signal and ashley didn't know which side of the court you were covering. - So it was my fault, that's what you're saying? - I'm saying you need to communicate better, william. You're still thinking as an individual. - We've talked about this. - We have and we said it's a process. - And you need to work harder. One plus one has to equal one, a team where you guys know what each other's thinking, you know each other's strengths and weaknesses. - Huh, and you really think you can help us with that? - If you trust the process. - We need her, william. - Fine. - Fine? - Fine, ashley says you're the one, fine. - Thank you, I know we can do this. - See, I can be a team player, plus, I have a massage in a half an hour so. - Of course you do. Tomorrow morning, bright and early. - Yeah, whatever you say, coach. - He's so annoying. - He'll come around. (gentle music) - beautiful ashley, you have incredible control. Little cautious on the second serve. - I know, I hold back, it's always been a problem. - Trust it, you know what you're doing. Any idea where william is? He promised he would be here today so. (phone alerting) - ugh, you're gonna hate this. - No doubt in my mind. - He's at a photo shoot for his sponsorship. "tell taylor not to be mad." - don't be mad. - Didn't he know about this last night? - Devil's advocate, maybe he didn't. His agent does his schedule and obviously will never pays attention. - Text him back, ask him where the photo shoot is. - Wait, why? What are you gonna do? (soft tense music) - [gunther] I need more. William, give me more. - More what? - Attitude, drive, passion. Play to the camera. Be a cat, a panther. - You're kidding, right? - The world of tennis is your jungle and you are master of it, strong, powerful. - Barry, can I get a translation on this? - What? I think he wants more movement, more action. Isn't that right, gunther? - He's just standing there wearing the clothes. What am I supposed to do with that? - I'm not a model, okay? If you wanted to action, put me on a court. - He's your client, barry. Help me. - Okay, okay, just calm down. Look buddy, I know you hate this stuff, you look great. Okay, why don't you just, hey, here, practice your serve. Okay, do something or we're gonna be here all day. Guys, it's looking great. It's looking so good. Just keep it up. Will, show me the money man, come on. Oh, fans need to wait outside. - I'm not a fan, I'm his coach. - Eh, what? That's impossible. - Barry. - Ah, ashley. (camera click) looking beautiful as always. - I see you've met our new coach, taylor morrison. - Huh, okay, what's going on here? Why exactly did william hire you? - Will and I needed help gelling as a team. - Okay, he should've run that past me first. - Barry, the bottom line is he should have been at the club an hour ago. I offered to coach them as a favor to ashley. - That's a very kind and generous offer- - but the only way I can do that is if they're together on a court, not at a, what is this, a fashion shoot? - That's exactly what this is. - Ah, the king of his domain. Roar for me. (william roaring) - okay, you need to trust me. This is very important stuff. The sponsor's pay the bills and they need these photos to promote the new sports line so. - What the sponsors need is for him to do well in the tournament and this does nothing for his game. - But it does great things for his bank account. - And yours too, I'm sure. - Haha. - Barry, tennis is a mental game. If he's not confident, it's not gonna happen. Does he look confident to you? - Okay, I'm done. Can we be done with this? - Okay fine, we're gonna try things your way, all right? Gunther, we're gonna need william back on the courts. Okay, we'll have to try roaring in the next week or so but I love your work. Come on, bud. - Sorry about that, are you mad? Definitely mad. - Just get changed, I'll drive you back to the club. - I can ride with barry. - Not a chance. With me, I know you'll make it. - Tough love, I like it. - Ashley's waiting in the car, just... - Okay, well, we're gonna talk about this, okay? Because I'm not sure if I approve. Woo, I love my job. Gunther, are you crying man? Come on. (cars beeping) (william sighs) - I mean I did say I was sorry. (cars beeping) and barry will now clear my mornings from here on out. Hey, I had to pretend to be a panther, all right? Is that not punishment enough? (taylor giggling) thank you. - Can we practice when we get back? - Oh, I don't think we can. I wasn't expecting to hit this much traffic. The club's closing early. There's actually fundraising event for my mom's scholarship program so. - Then, we'll be there. - No. - I have plans. - It's the least we can do for wasting your time today. - Okay, I guess. I do look good in a suit jacket. It really highlights my jaguar cheekbone. (girls giggling) yeah? (ashley growling) I'm gonna turn on some tunes. You guys like electric violin? (bright music) - we are so thrilled you could all join us today. The hope and joy that this sport can bring to all our youth is why raising money for tennis scholarships and underserved communities was my mom's passion. Thank you for making her passion her legacy. (audience applauding) - you did great. - [taylor] thank you. - You really did. But you said this was a small fundraiser. You totally undersold it. - Well someone started a rumor that ashley wong and william campbell would be here. Anyone know who that was, dad? - Oh, I have no idea. - Uh huh. - Oh, come on, it's for a good cause. A little star power never hurt. - I'm happy to help. - Well, in that case, I know some people who'd be very excited to meet you. - Dad. - Well lead the way, but as long as you save me a dance for later. - Done. - Okay. - Love you. - [ashley] okay. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Sponsor approved in case your instagram fans are lurking. - Ah. Mmm, yeah, no that is definitely it. Ordinarily, I'd tell you you couldn't pay me to drink this stuff, but obviously they do so. Sorry I'm late. Is barry here yet? - I didn't realize he was coming. - No me neither. But he said he wanted to talk to me so I said I would be available for a small donation to a good cause. - Very slick. - So the guest list, mainly your students? - Mostly their parents. - That must be a nightmare. Well, I mean dealing with a bunch of people who put all their baggage and expectations onto their kids. - Get a little of that but it's not bad. - My dad thought that tennis was the worst possible career choice, told me that early and often. - He must be very proud of you now. - Hey, there's barry. Probably push him towards the buffet line. Talks less with food in his mouth. - Sorry to interrupt, can I bar you for a sec? The local press want to take a quick photo? - Yeah, you two go, I'll manage barry. - Oh, good luck. - Ah, taylor, you hiding my client from me? - I don't think that's possible. He's got a very big mouth. - (laughing) - well, I'm glad we have a moment to talk. - Why is that? - I just want to hear what your angle is. Why are you really doing this? - Ashley's my best friend. - Okay. Look, I did some research. You were having very impressive stats before you left the tour. Are you thinking about going pro again? Are you using this coaching gig as a stepping stone? - No, that's not it. - No? Because the sponsors are already nervous. - If the sponsors are nervous, it's because of his losses, not about a little extra coaching. - Taylor, you don't know what the sponsors look at. - Why is he doing these doubles matches? - Ah, we don't really comment on that. - Well, people are gonna want to know, you got to come up with a better answer than that. - Mmm, it's fun, that's why. Do people not play sports for fun around here anymore? - People do, top ranked athletes usually don't. They usually avoid anything with the risk of injury. - Look, I have nothing against you, I really don't. I do all the hiring. William gets me to vet all his coaches and all major decisions go through me and that is for his own protection. I know what's best for him. - Well, you two seem like you're having a intense conversation. - There he is. - I'm a big fan of this song. You uh, do you want to dance? (soft pop music) - yeah. - Have fun. (soft pop music) - thanks for saving me. - Yeah, he can be a lot. Barry's a good egg though. He's taken care of me for a really long time. May I? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. - Whoa, whoa. - I know. - See, last year I did that celebrity dance show. I got a couple moves. - Weren't you kicked off first? - How dare you? I was kicked off third, which is what I'm told a very respectable number. - Yeah, but you were getting shown up by like football players. - Okay, you know what? The celebrity dance show, very stressful. - Wait, let me finish, I was gonna give you a compliment. - You give me a compliment, okay, I want to hear it. - The dance show, you committed, you saw it all the way through to the end. That's all I want you to do with tennis, just commit and see it through no matter what. - Okay, you got yourself a deal. - Okay. - Mmhmm, can I make a confession? - Yeah. - I was kicked off first. - Yeah, I know. - Lost to the magician. - Mmm, that's so sad. - Yeah. (bright music) (rain) you seriously want us to practice in this? - Do you seriously want to win? Okay. You two have a surprising advantage. You haven't been playing together so your opponents won't know what to expect. - That's actually not bad, I hadn't thought about that. - But I've been watching videos of your exhibition matches and I think we need to work on your serve. - My serve? Okay, my serve is the best part of my game. - It's also very easy to read, especially with two players watching your every move, comparing notes. - I've said that. - You did. - Oh, but there is one thing that I want you to work on this afternoon. - And what is that? - How to move like a panther. - So I'm just never gonna live that down then? - Nope. - Nope. - Why don't you hit the gym while I work with william? - Yeah, you got it. - Okay, get out here, go. - Bye. - All right, let's get started. Show me your serve. - Let's do it. (bright music) oh yeah, this is a great idea. How are you gonna improve on that? (bright music) - like that. - You know, ashley told me that you came home to look after your mom. You never went back to the circuit, why? - We're not here to talk about me. Again. - I can do this all day really. - And that's your problem. - And what is that? - You play poker? - I've been known to play the big three, poker, blackjack, go fish. - So you know players have tells, eyebrow raises, ticks, finger taps, body language that lets you know if they have a good hand or not. - Okay, indulge me. What is my tell? - It's your toss. Pick a serve, toss the ball, I'll tell you where you're going before you hit it. Straight down the middle. - How about this? - Slider, out wide. I could do this all day. - So how do I disguise it? You know, I asked around about you. They used to call you the ice queen on the tour. - I haven't heard that. - Calm and collected under pressure, that's what you were known for. - You spot a difference on the toss? - No, I did not. - Because there wasn't any, that's what we're gonna work on after this class. - [kids] good morning, coach taylor. - Hey! - [kid] hey coach. - Ashley and now william campbell, we're totally going to a celebrity tennis school. - William campbell is watching us? I don't think I can do it. - William's just a normal guy. - Oh, I don't know about that. Those eyes, stunning. - I'll be over here. - Okay, we gotta stay focused. Today's just a typical day. Let's warm up. Argen, you too. All right guys, let's go. (soft bright music) wow. Great job, argen. Woo, good job. (soft bright music) - [william] hey, what's your name? - Argen. - You got a good serve. Argen? Oh god, argen? Uh oh, argen. I think I broke argen. - He's not broken, he's just in shock. - I think he's outgrown his racket. Well, how about this? Use my racket, I'll take yours. I think this will help you out a little. - I'm gonna use william campbell's racket? - You absolutely will, yes. So argen, buddy, I'm gonna watch you hit a couple balls, would that be okay? - Yeah. - Hey, is that okay if I step in? - No, jump in. - Cool, may I? - Yeah. - Here you go, go for it. There you go. Nice buddy, remember, you can't hit what you can't see. So hit, finish, get back in position, okay? One more? - Yeah. - That's more like it. Good job, here. That's what I'm talking about, good job.

You look way too good using that thing. You should keep it. - I can't keep this, it's too much. - Mmm, what do you say to this then? How about you keep it for now? When you make it to your first us open, you and I play for it, deal? - Deal. - Okay, good job today, really good. (soft emotional music) what? - Nothing. - You want a child size racket? - You should have seen argen's face shen william gave him his racket. - Will can surprise you, no question. - One minute the sound of his voice fills you with rage and the next you want to give him a hug. - You want to hug him? - No, but argen gave him a hug. - What are you talking about? - Nothing, nothing important. - Great work today. - Thanks. - I was talking about me. - Of course you were. Listen, I've been thinking and you guys definitely have another problem. - Will's ego? - Don't be jealous of my hair, ashley, we've talked about this. - You're trying to play perfect tennis, you're trying too hard. - And that's bad because? - There's no such thing as a perfect game. You try and make that happen, you get tense. You get tense, you make mistakes. You guys need to learn to relax together. - I suppose you have a suggestion. - I do, you're gonna need hiking boots. Let everything go and focus on the water, the trees and the fresh air. What are you thinking? - [ashley] the flowers, the wildlife, the sky. - [taylor] william? - I am thinking that you have a problem with the way I play the net. - No tennis talk, you're supposed to be relaxing. - I relax by talking tennis. - Not today you don't. Today is about centering, appreciating nature. - Exactly. - With every breath, the only thing on your mind should be the- - bet I can beat you to the end of the trail. - Not a chance. - Stop. Notice the competitive feelings, breathe them out. - Taylor's right, we should totally stand here quietly and appreciate the view. Think I'll just race you there. - Code violation, I have a witness. - Why do I even try? (ashley grunting) ashley! - Ah, ah, my knee. - Oh, this isn't good. - No, it's like the opposite of good. (gentle music) - is shane here yet? - He's just parking. - I should have kept you two on the court. - You were trying to make a team out of us. It was my fault for trying to show off. - Hey, you know what? Injuries happen. A couple years ago, I blew out my knee, thought my career was over. Obviously, it is not. So you grind out your physical therapy you'll be back on the court in no time. - The gang's all here, taylor, will. - Hey shane, how are you? - It's a torn meniscus. - Well, you will do anything to get me to come home early, won't you? (phone ringing) - one sec, sorry. Hey barry, yeah no. - So she doesn't need surgery, but rehab's gonna be six to eight weeks. - There goes the tournament. - I'm so sorry, sweetie. - Just when it felt like will and I were starting to gel. - Yeah, no barry, I understand. All right, bye. - How's your agent taking the news? - Not well. Now trying to find me a replacement for ashley. - In three weeks, how's that going? - Well it would appear as if my reputation is caught up with me. They're either not good enough or they're so good they don't want to deal with my attitude. - You're not so bad once people get to know you. - Tell that to the seven no ways he just got off the phone with. - You know you could skip this doubles match. You don't even have to play the tournament. - You asked me to commit, see this through. - I was talking about committing to working with a coach. These are very different circumstances. - Maybe. I did however just tell barry about another possibility, a player we haven't reached out to yet. - Someone I know? - Super talented, gutsy, smart, tennis iq off the charts. - Make the call, she sounds great. - Yeah, she was a rising star before she had to step away. I think maybe though it's time for her comeback. - Are you talking about me? - Oh, I'm definitely talking about you. - You're a former top ranked player. - Okay, the former part kind of stings. - And I'm a former nobody. And you're asking to partner with me? Barry will never go for it, he doesn't even like me coaching you. - Taylor, you're my best chance at winning. I kinda need a win. - Do you? Sure you've had a few losses at the singles tournament. - More than a few. - But you're a huge star. You don't need to go around collecting wins. You know what you bring to the table. - Yeah, my charming smile and a bunch of meltdowns? Everybody loves the show. - It's a game, not a show. - Sometimes it doesn't feel like that. - You need to focus more on the game, less on the fame. - That's the issue, sometimes I don't know how anymore. - Barry signed you up for mixed doubles to get you to go back and focus on the game. - He saw me imploding, knew that if I didn't get my confidence back in front of a crowd, then I might not ever place singles or doubles again. - We both know that's not true. - Well, are you willing to take that risk and have that on your conscience for the rest of the time? - William, this isn't gonna be on my conscience till the end of this conversation. And even if I agreed, I haven't played at this level in years. What about ashley? I can't do that to her. - That's a great idea. - You don't think it sounds crazy? - It's crazy, crazy good. I don't want to be responsible for will missing out on this. I'd never hear the end of it, from him I mean. - She's right about that actually. You want her suffer like that? I mean have a heart. - I might be biased, but it sounds like the perfect solution to me. - Yes, taylor. I have no idea how long this recovery's gonna take. Please, take will, you have my blessing. - See, she doesn't even want me. Wait, you don't want me? - It doesn't feel right. I'm not ready. I can't just abandon my dad and my students. - They'll understand. - I have a whole life out here. This will totally blow it. - Then don't answer now. Take a a day, think about it. - Take a day. - Think about it. - You're thinking about it. (gentle music) - [taylor] all right. - Mmm, looks great. So have you decided if you're gonna accept william's offer? - It's way more complicated than that. - Why? Ashley gave you her blessing and it's not like there's an alternative. Somebody replaces her or william to drop out. - It's been three years, I've moved on. - Three years of teaching six classes a day, you haven't lost a step. - There's nothing wrong with my life as it is. I'm comfortable. - Except it's not the life you dreamed of, you or your mother. I can encourage you, but the choice has to be yours. Don't be afraid to make the uncomfortable one. So what do you say? - Pass the parmesan. Thank you. - All right. (doorbell ringing) - [taylor] william. - Good morning. - What are you doing here? - You know, you had the night to sleep on it, so what's the verdict? And before you answer, look, tennis is my whole life. I don't have a relationship with my family and my agent is literally my best friend so tennis, kind of all I got. If the two of us being partners is my best chance at being the player that I used to be I promise you I will do whatever it takes. - I understand. - Also trusting somebody else, kind of a big deal for me, and for whatever reason, I do trust you. So win, lose, whatever it is, you're the person I want with me on the court. - Okay. - Before you say, wait, that was a yes? - Yeah. - Was it the speech? 'cause I kind of worked on it. - The speech was lovely - [william] thank you. - But I had already decided. - Oh. - If you're willing to take a chance on me, I'm willing to take a chance on you. Let's shake on it. - Okay. But you liked the speech? - It was good. It was really nice. - Thank you, yeah, it felt good. There was a lot more too, yeah. - Oh, wow. - [william] that was the abridged version. - Okay, text it to me. Yeah. - Yeah (soft tense music) - got it? My bad. - My bad, that was on me. - Communication, guys, make sure you call for it. - Thanks for the reminder. - That's what I'm here for, right will? - Right, right. - No, no. Yes, okay. - Come on, come on. - Yes! - That's what I'm talking about. Okay. Hey, you feeling better about this? - One shot at a time. It's all about teamwork. - [taylor] okay, I'm here to spot if you need. - Don't need ya. - We can make it a trust exercise. I trust that you can handle this on your own and then you trust that I'm here to spot you if you can't. Are you sure you don't need help? - Maybe a little. - Okay, put this leg like that, okay good, see, there you go, better as a team, right? - Sure. Tournament's next week, should be hitting a thousand balls a day, which is how I usually would prepare. - And we'll do that but I need yoga to focus on my inner calm and I think someone they call the maestro of meltdowns might need help in that area too. - Yep, fine. - We should get to know each other better. It'll help us on the court. - What more could you possibly want to know? My life's an open book. - Well, you said your dad didn't want you to play tennis. - Okay, I'd rather not talk about my dad. - So much for being an open book. - Fine. Short version is he owns a restaurant, I was supposed to take over, but I went my own way. - Well, you became a world class athlete. - That's not how they saw it. They're disappointed in me for not following the family career path. We haven't spoken in years. - You should call 'em, invite them to the tournament. - Well, that's definitely not happening. - Come on, life's too short to let things go unsaid. Fine, we'll play for it. If you can do this next yoga pose, you don't have to call and you can continue to live your sad life of emotional chaos. - Emotional chaos, my band name. - Okay. That is cheating! - Yes, yes it was. Now can we talk about something else? Literally anything else, religion, politics, dating. - Dating. - I was kidding. - You're successful, you're famous and you're not that bad looking. - Not that bad looking, thank you. - Well, as long as you don't mind the ears. It might just be your haircut. - My hair is perfect. All right, you know what it's like. Grand slams, australian open, french open, wimbledon, us open, press tours, it's just easier if I do it alone. - Sounds lonely, just my opinion. - And have you been dating lately? - Nothing serious. - Ah, you touched ear, that's your tell, you're full of it. - No, I'm having trouble hearing you actually. - Yeah, I know, it's the noise from all the sad, emotional chaos inside of you. - Come on, let's get back to work. - All right. - Other side, pigeon other side. - It's a silly name. (taylor giggling) - hi dad. - Taylor, at this hour? - Yeah, the light was on, I saw your car in the driveway, I figured you were here somewhere. - Like the new merchandise? - I love it. - If you want a discount, I've got an in with management. - It's hard to pass that up. What do you think? - On you? Beautiful. - You're biased. - I'm your dad, it's in the job description. So you trying to impress someone special? - No, I'm just really nervous for the tournament. - Nerves are good, that's what your mom always said, right? Keeps you on your toes. You sure there's nothing else you want to talk about? - No, there's no time. William and I are spending every waking moment together until we have that joint nervous breakdown we've been working on. - There is such a thing as over training. Maybe you guys need to take a break before the match. - And do what? - What about the lake house? You guys can drive up there this weekend, clear your heads. - Together, for the weekend? - How bad can it be? - We could get bitten by ticks or walk through poison oak or I could drown him in the murky water. Sorry, was that too dark? - You really need a break. - Yeah.

Maybe I should find a place like this, some place to settle down when my career is over. - I guess you got a few good weeks before that happens. - I'm serious. - You could coach. - Kidding me, have you met me? I don't have the patience for that. - I've seen you at the club with argen and those kids. - You caught me on a good day. - Sports commentary? - Yeah, shane makes that look easy. I don't know though, I don't think I have the charm for that. - Hmm. - You could argue that point. - No, I think you're right, I think you should retire, get a rocking chair, whittle, knit. - You really never afraid of the future? - Not really. - Then please, tell me your secret, oh wise one. - You're not gonna like it. - Then now I really want to know. - I feel like if you survive the worst thing, that it gives you this weird confidence that you can survive anything. - Wow, that is terrible. - Yeah, I know it sounds bad, but makes me see the world in a different way. Makes me see tennis in a different way. I know that no matter what I'm gonna be okay. - Really very deep answer. I thought it was gonna be something like hummingbirds made you see the beauty in the world and then you were less scared. - Hummingbird? - Hummingbirds, yep. The only birds that can fly backwards, miracles. - Oh, you're chalk full of facts. - Yep, I watch a lot of national geographic when I'm on the road. I also know a lot about aztecs and country veterinarians. - [taylor] huh. - Interesting people. - Yeah, I'm sure.

So whoever gets the highest card gets to ask a question. - I love it, let's play. - Okay. Who's your favorite avenger? - Easy, ironman. - That is very on brand for you. - It is, isn't it? What is or was your favorite subject in school? - Math. - That is gross, mine was ee, no wait, lunch, yeah. - Okay. Chess or checkers? - Checkers, they don't have play chess with the stars so I'm not even entirely sure how I'd learn to play that game. Favorite food. - Breakfast. - Eh, that's a meal, not a food. - Okay, well agree to disagree. - We do disagree. - Do you still like to play? - This game? No, I find it wildly repetitive. - No, tennis. Do you still enjoy playing tennis? - Sometimes I do. - And other times? - Other times, I wish I was better. - Well, if you're insecure, there's no hope for the rest of us. - You know, when I was young, I used to think if I was the best on the court that maybe one day my parents would show up. Obviously, we both know how that went. (thunder rolling) - that must have been hard. - It was. The point I'm trying to make is that lately I've had a lot more fun playing tennis with you. It feels like I'm, I don't know, in the moment out there, like all that noise from all those years just sort of went away. - Well, I got your back. - I appreciate it. You hungry? - Growing up in a restaurant has its perks. That was delicious. Do you get to eat like this when you're on the road? - Yeah, when I can. Trick is finding a stove or an oven. - But what william campbell wants, he gets, right? - No, not always. Certainly not recently. I think people are getting kind of tired of my whole angry thing. - I haven't seen you do that once, not in six weeks. - I don't know, it's the entertainment part I guess. - You're faking it? You're faking emotional breakdowns? - No, obviously not, I have a temper, I just ham it up for the fans every now and then. That's the william campbell they expect to see. - That's probably why you're struggling. It's gotta be stressful like keeping up that persona. - Yeah, lose more games, lose more fans. - You could never lose them, they love you. - No, they love a winner. Could I say something without offending you? - You can try. - I'm gonna try. What you said earlier about the worst thing happening to you like giving you the confidence to get through anything? - Yeah. - I really don't think that's true. - Excuse me. - I'll explain. The worst thing did happen to you, but I think it made you more scared than ever. You're hanging onto safety at the detriment of everything else. - Why would you say that? - Taylor, I mean, I've seen you worry about your life changing at every step for us. - Wouldn't you be worried? - No, I wouldn't, unless it was an excuse that I was using to protect myself from something. You're way too talented to be hiding in the shadows. - I'm not hiding. I came off tour because my dad needed me and that's why I'm here. - Did he tell you that? - No, but he would never say that. I know how lonely he is without my mom, and no matter what he says, I know that he needs me. - You're a good daughter. - Anyone would do the same. - I know that's not true. - I'm gonna think about what you said, I really am. - I'm glad. This was a good idea your dad had. - We make a good team. - We do. - Come on, let's get dessert. - Yeah, I'll help you. (gentle music) - all right, we'll see you in the stands. Make us proud. - Okay. - Take care of miss taylor. She is the best of us. - All right, well you know, we're playing tennis, not joining the navy so. - I'm watching you. (laughing) all right. All right, drive safe. - Okay. - See ya. - You're an odd one. - Yeah, I am. (upbeat music) - you ready for this? - Ready as I'll ever be. - Ah will, good you're here. I've got an interview set up for you in the ballroom, okay? - Shouldn't taylor come up me then? - Yeah, there'll be time for that, don't worry, but today, you're the story. Come on. - Okay. You good? - Yeah. - All right. - All right, looking sharp. Here, you want me to take that? - Hey, taylor morrison. - We have you in our grand suite with one king bed. - That can't be. - Two queens it is. - No, I mean I don't have a suite. - Compliments of william campbell. - And guess who requested a room next to yours? - Ashley, how's your knee? - I'm not running the new york marathon anytime soon but at least I'm off crutches. - I didn't know you were coming. - I wouldn't miss it. What time is it? - Good morning. Thanks for tuning in. I'm shane sanders sitting here today with william campbell. William, let's get right into it. - Sure. - It's well known that you've been mia from tournament play and you've never- - shane's doing the interview? This can't be big enough for him to cover. - It's not, but william hasn't played tennis in a long time, people are curious. Suddenly this small tournament is getting a lot of attention. - Well, you know, you're right about that, I haven't played a lot of doubles in my career, just charity events, exhibition matches, for fun really. - So the obvious question, why the change up? Why now? - I just needed a new challenge, you know? - Interesting that you found it playing doubles. - Yeah, more than I expected. - Given the short amount of prep time that you and taylor have had, what do you think of your team's chances? You think you can win your first time out? - Oh, I know we can. - Well, there you have it, folks, that william campbell confidence is coming through loud and clear. - This could relaunch your career. - Maybe or it could sink his. (soft tense music) (people chattering) - welcome everybody to the first ever georgia sun tennis tournament. And what a perfect setting for what's to come. I'm tracy austin, here with shane sanders, and we have a very exciting first round today. - That's right, tracy, natalia kolar and jack roberts, a tough team to beat. - Yeah, both out of seattle and both with a long history of titles. - They're certainly the favorites to sweep the weekend, but I think the reason this tournament is getting so much attention is william campbell back from the dead and playing doubles. - No question. And it's rare to get a chance to see a player like william campbell, especially playing mixed doubles as an underdog. This should be riveting tennis. - [shane] stay tuned, folks. - [fan] love you, will. - Okay, remember to breathe out there. What else do you tell your students? - Check your laces twice. - Okay, what else do you tell your students? - Stop complaining. - Fun, you tell them to have fun. So have fun, yeah. It's nice of your dad to show up. - Yeah, he's the president of my fan club. You should reach out to your parents. I know you want to see them in the stands. - Well, it doesn't matter what I want. If they don't want it too, then it's too late for us. - It's never too late. - Let's play the match. - Okay. - Court 13 as william campbell and his partner taylor morrison take on the hungarian team of laslo vastog and zola nagy. - It's sure to be a tough match, but I've seen campbell and morrison practice a bit so don't count them out just yet. - This could be a spectacular experiment or a spectacular failure. - Vastog and nagy serve, first set in best of three. (tense music) (grunting) (audience applauding) - in a surprise upset, william campbell and taylor morrison, who've never played his partners before, are out matching the hungarian team. - Incredible, six, four in the first set, five, two now in the second and we're at match point. - Can they close it out? (tense music) (players grunting) (audience applauding) - yes, that's what I'm talking about! - Game, william campbell and taylor morrison win the match two, 12. (audience applauding) (upbeat music) (rhythmic music) - cheers. - Cheers. One match, one win. You two are the talk of the tournament. - Well, at least when I'm doing the talking. But really, the two of you must be thrilled with how it's going. - Of course, but this should really be ashley's week so. - Thanks tay, but honestly, it's a relief to have the pressure off. Maybe you should consider a more permanent partnership with will if he's open to it. - What? - We've started talking about me taking some time away from tennis. I want to travel to all the places in the world that do not have tournaments. - And she says she might even let me join her. - We'll see. But really, spending time with you and your dad made me realize there's something to having a life outside of all of this. - And you know, when she does decide to come back to the game, she should be happier and stronger than when she left. - Mmm, come here. - So how would you feel about this being a more permanent change? - Come over here. Hey, as long as you miss me desperately and you call me every month to tell me that, then I think I'll get by. - You're funny. - Thank you. - You know, I really should mingle with some of the people from the network. Do you mind joining me for that? - Of course. - Go for it. - Bye. - So tell me, what do you think? - This was always designed as a temporary partnership. You play singles. - I could play both if you agree to be my partner. - This is premature. Let's just play tomorrow. - Okay, okay. But I still think today's win is cause for a celebration. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, the champagne is only for photo ops, not for drinking yet. More matches to come. Now, if you guys make it to the finals, you're gonna probably be playing with those two right there. They are cutthroat players so less celebration and more focus, please. - Well, hello friends. - Hey. - And this is taylor, yes? We haven't met. - Katrina hampton, taylor morrison. - Pleased to meet you. - Katrina actually represents one of my biggest sponsors. - It's nice to see you back on the courts, great style. - Thanks. - Tennis could use more of that. - Well, we're actually here to talk about william's sponsorship deal. - Yes, if he keeps himself together and avoids anymore on court theatrics, we might want to expand it. - Well, the theatrics are part of his brand, right? - They used to be part of his brand. I like this version of william campbell. - Thanks but I say anything new has to involve taylor. I wouldn't be here without her so. - Oh, I thought she was only subbing for ashley wong in this tournament. - I'm not sure yet, actually. - We haven't signed anything official, but we're thinking maybe this could be a more permanent thing. - I think it might be a little bit too early to discuss any of that. - Agreed, we still have to get through the tournament tomorrow. - But if we keep our partnership going, then taylor's gonna need her own deal and that is non-negotiable. - William, this isn't the time. - No, no, no, I like it. Like this might be the new spin that we're looking for. It's good. - Okay, great. You know what, you don't have a drink. Why don't I get you something at the bar and we can discuss? - I'll be in touch, taylor. - What just happened? - Well, we're partners, you know, we stick together, we look out for one another. - I appreciate that, but all of this, being permanent partners, that's it's more than just a tournament, it's a whole new life. - Taylor, you're always telling me that life is too short. If that's true, then shouldn't you be chasing your dreams? One sip. - Fine. (upbeat music) - [fan] oh my gosh, there he is. Look, will campbell. - Better get used to this. - I'm not sure that's possible. - Hi, sure thing. (upbeat music) - another beautiful morning here at the georgia sun tournament in atlanta. We're now taking you down to court two as the cinderella story of this tournament gets started. And there we see william campbell and taylor morrison being greeted like rock stars. - Taylor morrison has been a revelation, what a story. From coaching kids at a local club to now playing against ronnie kurlan and alexander gluwig for a spot in the finals. - [fan] let's go will and taylor! Woo, let's do this! (tense music) - [reporter] whoa, whoa, here they are, here they are. Hey william, taylor. Hey, we got a question please, quick question. - Bella santos, tennis week. Congratulations on the win. The match today was extraordinary. What do you think when you watch the footage? - It doesn't feel real. It feels like I'm watching someone else. - Well, I'm very sore so it was definitely us. - For a team this new, how do you explain your success? - Actually, I think, taylor, you could probably answer that better than I could. - Oh, well that's simple, william and I just have very complimentary playing styles. - Watching you two, I get the feeling that there's more to this team than just tennis. Anything we should know? - It's just tennis. - For now at least. (gentle music) (reporters yelling) - for now at least? - Oh, you know this week is tennis, next week we might take up curling, I don't know. - It didn't sound like that. - What did it sound like? - Nevermind. - No, no, please, I want to know what you're thinking. - I'm thinking this isn't your floor. - Well, I am walking you to your door. A gentleman does that I hear. - I see. - We have the day off tomorrow. You want to do something fun? - We could continue to practice in the heat. - Which would be fun, but I was thinking maybe something more like walk around the city, clear our heads. - Okay. - Okay. - Night. - Night. Hey, thank you for doing this by the way. Honestly, there's really no one I'd rather be here with. - Me too. - Get a good sleep. (birds chirping) - [will] so why are you so reluctant to be my permanent doubles partner? Ashley's all for it. - Barry hates the idea. He doesn't think I'm good enough for you. - I don't think that's true. And in all fairness, barry hates everyone. - Okay, say we do something as crazy as all that, and I'm not saying I'm down, one of us will have to move. - Okay, well I know you're close with your dad, I could come to atlanta. - I don't even know where you live. - Manhattan, block away from a tennis club. Actually, a unit just became available in my building right across the hall. - So one of us uproots their whole life and then what if our partnership doesn't work? - And why wouldn't it? - I don't know, things happen that pull people apart all the time. - True. We're not just any people though, we're us. (gentle music) your dad's not mad I'm taking up all your free time tonight? - No, actually he's out with friends and we're gonna go to breakfast tomorrow. - I like it, man about town. Feels like this is a big weekend for all of us. - Yeah. I actually wanted to talk to you about something. - I am gonna pick the first song and then you pick the second. - Okay. Do you like surprises? - No, I love surprises. - Okay, well the only reason I'm asking is cause I hate surprises, they stress me out. - Well, I think you're gonna love this one. - Okay. - I think it might have eaten my quarter. - That's a bummer, but I really just wanted- (soft pop music) - you hear that? - What? - It's playing our song. - We don't have a song. - Come here. You know, I used to get very mad on the court, yeah, get distracted by all the noise, but when I'm out there with you, I just feel more in the moment, like you're all I listen to, all I want. - This is a bad idea. - Possibly. - We can ruin everything. - I really don't think it will. - William. - Taylor, if you don't want to do this, I... ♪ when will I know ♪ - I had to kiss you. They were playing our song so. ♪ make time to show you ♪ ♪ you're the only one for me ♪ ♪ but I needed a sign ♪ ♪ thought you needed a scene ♪ ♪ but I looked deep into your eyes ♪ - [william] this was a really nice night. - [william's mother] william. - Hello son. - Dad, mom, what are you, what are you doing here? - Taylor invited us. - They're here early, surprise. - Why would you do this? - You said you like surprises? Fine, you said it was too late to connect with them. I just wanted to prove to you that you were wrong. - Taylor, I'm not one of your students, okay, you don't have to teach me a lesson or something. - That's not what I was trying to do. - You should have talked to me about this. - I tried. - You should have tried harder. - I'm sorry. I really wish my mom was here to watch us in the tournament. Maybe I was projecting and I thought that's what you wanted. - I get that. But taylor, I don't share your issues. - What issues are those? - You're afraid to say goodbye to your dad, I get it, you're afraid of what that means, but I don't share that dynamic with my parents. - I'm not afraid. - I'm sorry, but you really shouldn't have done this. - Will. (gentle music) - [barry] I heard what happened, man. I got to say she probably just thought she was helping. - Yeah well what she doesn't realize is that my relationship with my parents is over and I'm fine with that. - Yeah, you sound fine with it. - She wants me to sit down with them and talk about my feelings. I'm not gonna do that. - She's right, will. - No, no, you don't get to take her side on this one. Okay, I pay you to be on my side, barry. - Hey, I'm always on your side, man. - Thank you. - That's why I'm agreeing with taylor. You have unfinished business with your folks. And I know that you're mad, and yes, she could have handled things better, but she cares about you, too much to let you live some half life without them. And that right there, that's a real partner. (gentle music) - oh, oh and after dinner, we went to a jazz club. I felt like I was 18 again. And then we bought llamas and rode them to the moon. - I'm glad you had fun. - Taylor ann morrison, what's going on with you this morning? - I'm just afraid if I do well in the tournament that my career is gonna take off again. - That'd be great news, sweetie. Why would that be so bad? - Because then I'd have to leave you and you'd be all alone. - Taylor, I love you. It would destroy me if I thought I was holding you back. - You're not holding me back, it's me. Mom's gone and you're all I have and I can't leave you. - Taylor, I love that you cared enough to stay around after your mom passed, I needed it, but it's time for you to take your life back. Don't let fear keep you here. You listen to me, I'll be fine. I miss your mom, I always will, but I need to start rebuilding my life and she would want you to do the same. I want you to follow your heart. (gentle music) - okay, I'm afraid I messed it all up. (gentle music) - [father] you were good at something I didn't understand. What does a third generation restaurant owner know about tennis? - So we stopped talking because you were jealous? - See, I can't talk to him. - Honey. I was ashamed of myself. People told me that you were gifted at 10 years old, that you needed certain lessons, clothing, equipment. I couldn't afford most of it. - What are you talking about? I had everything that I needed. - He got a second job. - What? - He never wanted you to know. - I would've quit. - That's why I didn't want you to know. - No, that's not true, you weren't around because you hated that I was playing tennis. - No, I hated not being what you needed. Things just kept escalating. - The things you said to one another were cruel. I kept hoping one of you would stop, but you, you just kept pushing and pushing on each other. - Yeah, it got ugly. I was rude, argumentative, I admit that. - Yeah, you were. - You weren't exactly delicate. - Thank you. - It went too far. All these years without talking, I'm sorry son. - Yeah, I'm sorry too. - When taylor called, she said that you wanted us here. She said she knew you missed us, but you didn't know how to reach out. - That you thought it was too late. - But it could never be too late. You're our son. - Yeah, that's exactly what taylor said you would say. (parents giggling) - I like her. - I have to talk to her before our match tonight. Could we maybe continue this later? - Of course. - I guess I'll see you in the stands. - We'll be there. - Thanks. - That a boy. (gentle music) (phone buzzing) - he's not answering. I didn't expect him to, I mean I went behind his back, he trusted me, the only person he trusted. - He wouldn't stand you up. - [taylor] I wouldn't blame him if he did. - So that's it, you're just gonna give up on relaunching your career? - No. This whole experience made me realize how bad I want this. I'm gonna relaunch my career with or without him. This isn't how my story ends. - That's my girl. - All right, no more time to waste, I gotta let them know he's not coming. (gentle music) - what a story. In a last minute first time team up, william campbell and taylor morrison have made it to the finals of today's georgia sun tournament. - A small tournament, but with big consequences. Campbell and morrison will need to get the win to get ranked. - That's right and they're going to need that ranking to join more high profile events in the future. - But it won't be easy because in this final matchup, natalia kolar and jack roberts have history on their side. (dramatic music) - [announcer] entering court, taylor morrison and william campbell. (audience applauding) (inspiring music) - [tracy] no sign of william campbell, not a great way to start. (inspiring music) (audience cheering) - you came back. - I was being a jerk. I'm on a bit of an apology tour this morning. - Well, thanks for stopping in my town, but you were right to be angry and that I was afraid to leave my dad. - Well, that seems impossible, I'm never right. - Even people with bad hair get lucky sometimes. - You ready to finish what we started? - Yeah. - Looks like things are back on track. What would you say taylor and william need to do today to get the win? - They're going to need to keep that momentum going. Their chemistry on the court is clear and now they've had a chance to see roberts and kolar play so they know their strengths and weaknesses. They're going to need to serve well and get plenty of returns back in play. - Well, don't mess up in front of your family and friends. - Thanks, no pressure. - You know what they say about pressure, taylor? It makes diamonds. Let's both go out there and make diamonds. - Please stop talking. - Okay.
