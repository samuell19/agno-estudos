We've failed tonight. They're wary of skeptics. Are you referring to me? That's right. You're the only outsider here. But - We shouldn't have let you record our communications. Do you believe in UFOs? Well... l'm interested. But you don't really believe. They sensed your mistrust through your brain waves. My brain waves? l'm sorry, but l find that incredible. You have to admit that lots of strange things have been happening lately. What month is it? January, of course. The middle of winter. Yet feel how hot it is! The newspapers are reporting a heat wave. Doesn't that worry you? And it's not just here on Earth. Strange things have been occurring beyond our galaxy too. You make it sound like the whole planet's about to explode. No, l don't think it will explode, but l fear something terrible is going to happen. We hoped the UFOs could tell us what, so we could warn the world. Sir, a UFO! That's not a UFO. lt's a meteor. There's another one! And another! Hard at work, l see. Something happen? lf so, your paper would be on it before us cops. Then what's up? The chief wants to have a talk. Join us? - No way! l'll pass on the stomach-churning lecture. Lots of sirens again tonight. What's going on? You haven't heard about the encephalitis outbreak? And you call yourself a reporter. Encephalitis? ln the middle of winter? The calendar says it's winter, but everything's gone haywire. That's for sure. Hey, there's another one! Another what? Meteor. Meteor showers are being reported all over the world. lt's getting strange out there. The Earth is going mad. DAMAGE FROM HEAT WAVE MOUNTS MERCURY REACHES 82 DEGREES BEACHGOERS AT NEW YEAR Sorry l'm late, Shindo. l just now got through to Selgina. Selgina? That tiny country embroiled in domestic dispute. Princess Maas Doulina Salno is making an unofficial visit to Japan. l want you to be her bodyguard. Me? lt's under the radar, so they don't want any fuss. What's she coming for? Sightseeing? According to our sources, there's a plot to assassinate her. As successor to the throne, she's had to flee Selgina until it's safe. This is above my pay grade. When does she arrive? She's already on her way. Already? This is her. - Has the princess left? - Yes, sir. - And the bomb? - Carefully planted. She'll never make it back alive. Good work. What are you looking at, Your Highness? l feel as if l could touch the stars. Will you be retiring now? Not just yet. l'd like something to drink. Right away. Rise. Rise! You must get out now. Flee. Flee! Your Highness! Kurobe Dam. End of the line. You must be from the technical institute. Yes. Murai's the name. - Welcome. - What's the situation? We've been seeing lots of meteors. One last night was enormous. lt fell at a 60-degree angle over Mount Kurodake. Never seen anything so bright. Lucky it didn't hit the dam. - Over Mount Kurodake? - Yeah, around here. - Near Kasumizawa? - l believe so. The air currents there are so violent that helicopters can't fly into the valley. That suspension bridge and the mountain trail are the only way in. There it is. What's the matter? Kasumizawa should be southeast, right? Yeah, based on the sun's position. My compass is pointing north. You must have bought a cheap one. Mine's doing the same thing! What's going on? Let's go. Professor, there it is! lncredible! Let's make camp here. Unload your packs. We can get water over there. Chief, when does the princess arrive? - Forget about that. - Forget about it? Her plane exploded en route. Exploded? Was it her political opponents? Good question. Any clues? None. The Foreign Ministry's in the dark too. How awful, a woman like that falling victim to a power struggle. Here. You have to admit that lots of strange things have been happening lately. What month is it? Naoko! A breaking story! A prophet has appeared. - A prophet? Great stuff for Mysteries of the 20th Century. Go cover it. - Where? Ueno Park. Two reels should be enough. Ladies and gentlemen... have you ever thought about the infinitely expanding universe? The time has come for all earthlings to awaken to their responsibilities as citizens of the universe. Are you a man or a woman? How about a strip show? Poor girl suffers from megalomania. Maybe it's the heat wave and the encephalitis outbreak. The Earth is on the brink of destruction... yet you refuse to take me seriously. Why? Please let us through! Where are you from? Outer space? But you're Japanese, aren't you? l come from Venus. Venus? Venus? ls that in Africa? ldiot! lt's a planet. A planet? You're from...? So we can travel through space now? We should go! You spoke of the Earth's destruction. How will it come about? First something strange will happen on Mount Aso. There's no sign of increased volcanic activity on Mount Aso. As you can see, it's Mount Sakurajima that's more active. Whether that woman is from Venus or not, it's absurd to believe in such predictions. Thanks for the ride. Thank you very much. - l'm home. - Welcome back. Naoko just got home too. l think she's got a boyfriend. Why? Just a hunch. You had me worried! Hi there. You're home early. - l saw something very interesting. - What? Girl falls for man with nice car. Who was that guy? Oh, him! Don't talk about Mr. Murai like that. ls this Mr. Murai your boyfriend? Of course not! He's an associate professor at the university. Sounds like a catch. Mother... Professor Murai was up in the mountains. He's investigating that meteorite. He was telling me about it. lt's very strange. Look. More Mysteries of the 20th Century? You're always talking about work. l have to collect lots of stories before the program debuts. Turn on Channel 7. This is the news! lt's Mom's favorite show. lt's kind of entertaining. Be a good son. We bring you... Where Are They Now? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Where Are They Now? The program that gives viewers... the chance to meet people who've made the headlines. - Here to make their request... - Our first guests. Two adorable little boys! Come right this way! - How old are you? - Five. What a cutie! Just about your height. Cut it out! Who is it you boys would like to meet? Mothra! Now that's a surprise! And a tall order! We can't meet Mothra? - l wouldn't say can't, but - - You lied! l never lie. You sound like a politician! All the way from lnfant lsland, home of the amazing Mothra... we bring you... Welcome! l believe you all know that these charming little ladies... live with Mothra on lnfant lsland. Good evening, everyone. Good evening, boys. Good evening. Now's your chance to ask about Mothra. - Miss? - Yes? How are the two Mothras? Thanks for asking, but l'm afraid one passed away. What about the other one? She's doing fine. She's still a baby, but she keeps peace on the island. Would you like to see her? Yes! Then we'll sing her song. Close your eyes real tight... and you'll see Mothra. Let's all close our eyes. Let us seek happiness On our dear island Where the sky meets the sea We are happy So why do you cry? Do not forget to smile Let us seek happiness The breeze will carry you to us on the clouds Let us seek happiness This would be great for my program, huh? Not my cup of tea. Lighten up or you'll turn into a beady-eyed old grump. What? He thinks everyone's a crook. Mother! Stop this! You're not children anymore. Act your age! "VENUSlAN" PREDlCTS DlSASTER You sent for me, sir? Look at this. What? That paper just arrived from Japan. Are you sure you blew up the princess's plane? l swear there was no mistake. Then why is she in Tokyo? This can't be. Besides, this woman isn't wearing the royal bracelet. This picture alone doesn't prove it's the princess. Go to Japan immediately and look into this. Yes, sir. And if it is the princess? Kill her, of course. Fail and you'll pay with your life. Go! The station has decided to do a show about this woman from Venus. Especially her predictions. l want to investigate them from every angle. That should make an interesting show. ls all our other material being shelved? l didn't mean that. We're just opening the series with the Venusian. But no one knows where she is. Then go find her. You have eyes and legs, don't you? Any ideas? We better sign her to an exclusive contract. That's right. She always appears before a crowd. Next time she does, don't lose her! The resemblance is striking, but the Foreign Ministry says the princess of Selgina would always wear the royal bracelet on her arm. What if she's concealing it to throw off her enemies? Same for all that Venus nonsense. How about bringing her in? We have no grounds to. Spreading rumors isn't a crime. Chief, let me follow her. We have to do something. Okay, but you're on your own. l'm in Shibuya. l haven't seen her yet. No sign of her anywhere else? Okay, l'll call you later. Bye. Big brother! Having a slow day? lt looks like you are. l'm on a stakeout! Not very ladylike language. How about some coffee? Sure. l'm waiting for someone anyway. Welcome. - They're not here yet? - No. You have ten minutes. Then you can pay and buzz off. l'm not paying. Sorry, l was talking to her. What will you have? - Blue Mountain. Two, please. Who are you staking out? Can't tell anyone, even you. You're no fun. Sorry l'm late. Sure it's all right? - Please! This is my brother. Murai of the Teito Technical lnstitute. My brother thinks you're my boyfriend. Hey, can it! l'm honored. You look ready for action. l'm going up to the mountains again. - To investigate that meteorite? - Any findings? We've discovered that it exerts a strange force, like magnetism or gravity, but different. Perfect for Mysteries of the 20th Century. lt's even more shocking than that woman from Venus. The self-proclaimed prophet from Venus appeared yesterday at the Mount Aso crater and warned sightseers to leave immediately. This is the center of the crater. Tama-chan, here we go. l'll put my arm around you. People, you must leave here immediately. You don't realize the great danger you're in. Please leave now. ls it going to erupt? l'm not talking about an eruption. Volcanic gas beneath the Earth's crust will reawaken Rodan. Rodan? l'm scared. Let's go home. Don't mind her. She's crazy. l'll protect you. My hat! lt's gone for good. l gave that to you as a present! l can't go down there! l'll get it for you. Seven hundred yen! Five hundred! How about 200? Two hundred? lt's a deal! Great! Stop! Come back! Shut up, crackpot! You'll put me out of business! Come back! Help! lt's Rodan! Our visit is a secret, right? Of course. l've put you in a quiet hotel. Good. And where's the princess - l mean... the Venusian? She's been missing since Rodan reappeared, but she'll turn up. Are the police looking for her? They're too busy to bother with her. Police have evacuated the entire Japanese Alps area. Climbers and sightseers have been ordered to stay away. Police are also warning that the meteorite in Kasumizawa may explode. Only the research team is allowed on the mountain. All others must stay away. - l'm going. - Wait a minute. Professor, the light's getting brighter. But it's very odd. There's no magnetism today. We shouldn't ignore the signs. We should get out of here. This is our only opportunity. An object from outer space - doesn't that intrigue you? Sure, but it scares me too. lt's fifty-fifty. Professor, it seems bigger than before. Meteorites don't swell up like balloons! Let's investigate. Anything to say before you leave? We thank you all. We're going back to lnfant lsland. lf we call you again, will you come? With pleasure. But we'd prefer less fanfare. What do you think about Rodan? Can you use your telepathy to tell us where he is? Telepathy is not for prediction. We can't tell you anything. But Rodan will appear again soon. Good-bye, everyone. This ship must not sail! lt must not sail. The woman from Venus! Captain, the Venusian is on board. What? l didn't authorize that. She says not to sail. l give the orders! Get rid of that crackpot. Why will no one listen to me? This ship mustn't sail. Come with me. - Who are you? - A friend. Let us through! Get off this ship! Please wait. l'll take full responsibility for her. Naoko, wait! Chief, l found it! - Found what? The Venusian? - She's the princess! Where'd you get this? A man tried to sell it to an antique dealer. Have a seat. Now, where did you get this? l didn't steal it. l'm an honest fisherman. l just want to know where you got it. l got it in exchange for my cap, jacket, and trousers. Where? At sea. At sea? lt's true! On my way back from fishing l found a woman adrift... and l helped her. lt's true! - Didn't that seem odd? Sure. l meant to take her to the police in port, but when l got ashore, she was gone. You recognize the woman with the bracelet? That's my cap! lt's her! This one too! We'll need you to stick around. Take him. l didn't do anything! l know you're not a thief. We just need a statement. Chief, what do you think? She was in that plane that exploded in midair. How could she alone survive? You find it odd? Even a child would. How about you? l've asked around, but no one takes it seriously. But one person said something interesting: the head of the UFO society. l think she survived because she fell into a gap between dimensions. You may not be aware of this... but there are other dimensions besides those we know. And there's a whole other world therein. The explosion created a gap between the two worlds. She was saved when she fell into it. Welcome. l'm with Toyo Broadcasting. ls the usual room available? l'm afraid not. Would the room across the hall do? Room 384? All right. Are you doing a story on the homeless? Something like that. Come on. Here we are. ln you go. That's the princess. Right? - l'm not sure. But it sure looks like her. - Let's do it. - Hold on. She saw me but didn't react. lt might not be her. News department. ls the chief in? lt's Naoko. l'm with the Venusian woman. lt's true! We're at the usual hotel. Everything's fine. Can you do me a favor? Could you bring her some clothes? You can stay here tonight. There's someone else here. There's no one here but you and me. Good evening. You didn't stay onboard? - That's right. - Why not? We understand what she meant. And that was...? You mustn't board that ship. Can you explain why? ls something wrong with that ship? lt's too late now. Professor, that must be some kind of monster. lt's grown another 0.8 percent. Very odd! l've never heard of a meteorite growing! Well, this one is. How's the magnetic force? No readings. lt's gone dead. We should get out of here. There's nothing more we can do. The magnetic force is back! Get some readings! lt fits perfectly! Where are you going? My duty is to warn everyone possible about the danger facing the Earth. Wait. You can tell all of Japan without leaving this room. Hello? Speaking. No, don't send him up! l'll be right down. Wait here, okay? Don't go anywhere. What do you want? What do you think? The princess is in your room. "Princess"? l don't know what you're talking about. Princess... it's been a while. l am from Venus. Don't give me that! You're the princess of Selgina. l know no such person. You must leave here at once. There's no need to make sure. Let's just kill her. Hold on. This isn't Selgina. lf she's forgotten, this should jog her memory. Well? l killed your father with this dagger. Give me back that key! How many times do l have to tell you? That Venusian woman is the princess. You brought her here from the harbor. Give me the key! Stop it or l'll call the police! ldiot! Have you forgotten l'm a cop? l could have you arrested. Let me go! What are you going to do with her? Protect her, of course. And send her back when she recovers. l've arranged for treatment. All right. Come on up. Now, Your Highness... what did you do with the bracelet? - Bracelet? - That's right. Try to remember. You wore the royal bracelet on your right arm. That's right. You must remember. l am from Venus, and yet... And yet? What? l may have worn a bracelet. Why don't you have it now? Such things are worthless. You earthlings must open your eyes. Where is the bracelet? l gave it to a poor man. Who's there? Turn on the lights! Watch out! Assassins! Naoko, the fire alarm! lt's safe now. Turn on the lights. lt's you two! Thank you. Your Highness! Clinical Study of Acute Amnesia and Delusional Disorders. You can read in the dark? l am from Venus. lt's too dangerous here. Let's go. Where? l've arranged for a doctor to examine her. Come on, quick! lt's Godzilla! lt's Rodan! Where are we going? Dr. Tsukamoto's lab. Dr. Tsukamoto? He's a brilliant psychiatrist. The police owe him a lot. He's helped us solve lots of cases. Fifteen. Twenty. All right. Doctor, will she recover? Recover? There's nothing wrong with her. She's perfectly normal. Then why does she say she's from Venus? ls she really from Venus? l doubt it. l'll get her to tell us who she is. l've developed a new treatment, a kind of hypnotic drug. Look. Do you still not understand? The Earth will perish if it carries on like this. King Ghidorah will turn this planet into a tomb. King Ghidorah? He's a space monster who wiped out our civilization on Venus. Venus was once far advanced beyond today's Earth. But because of King Ghidorah, it's a desolate wasteland... forevermore. ls King Ghidorah coming to Earth? Yes. He's already here. The Earth's end is imminent. You don't believe me, do you? l can see it in your eyes. lt's like she's examining us instead. This is no time to joke around! Go to sleep now... Attention! Godzilla and Rodan are proceeding to Mount Fuji from Hakone. Be prepared to evacuate at any moment. Hey, wake up! Professor, look! Let's have a look! Get back, quick! Look! Something's forming! This is the Matsumoto City lnformation Bureau. The space monster that appeared last night in Kasumizawa has been identified as King Ghidorah... Professor Murai has explained in detail how the space monster King Ghidorah appeared. Besides Godzilla and Rodan... we now have King Ghidorah too! How will the government deal with this crisis? l call on the Defense Minister and Prime Minister... to give us a straight answer. Defense Minister. Our Self-Defense Forces are closely monitoring... the movements of Godzilla and Rodan. As for King Ghidorah... we're in close contact with international coalition forces. We're doing our best... to destroy the monsters as quickly as possible. We don't want excuses. We want to know how you'll destroy them! Defense Minister. This is not just Japan's problem. lt's the entire world's as well. Would any of you dare suggest we use atomic weapons against Godzilla and Rodan? l don't believe any further explanation is necessary. We can only do our best and let heaven's will be done. FUJl NATURE CENTER Gentlemen, l've taken the liberty of bringing some people here. As the defense minister said, we need all possible help. Will you hear them out? Very well. lt's that girl! Let me introduce Miss Naoko Shindo of Toyo Broadcasting, and as you know, these ladies are from lnfant lsland. l thought you returned to your island. No, we stayed with the prophet. The prophet? Ah, the woman from Venus. Where is she now? Dr. Tsukamoto's lab on Mount Fuji. Let's go get her. As you know... Mothra once defeated Godzilla. This may sound primitive and unscientific... but through these ladies we could ask for Mothra's help. Ladies, would you ask her? No? We're afraid not even Mothra can defeat King Ghidorah. So she can't protect lnfant lsland from King Ghidorah either? That's right, and it has us worried. But... But what? There is one hope. What's that? For Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra to join forces. Together they may be able to defeat King Ghidorah. But who'll persuade Godzilla and Rodan to help? We'll ask Mothra to do that. But if Godzilla and Rodan refuse... it's all over. lt's Ghidorah! We're running out of time! Please call Mothra immediately! Please call her! Let us seek happiness On our dear island Where the sky meets the sea We are happy So why do you cry? Do not forget to smile Let us seek happiness The breeze will carry you to us on the clouds Let us seek happiness - Doctor, is she completely under? - Yes. Draw the curtains. Then get ready to evacuate. Now perhaps we'll discover the princess's past. You're asleep, but your mind is awake, correct? Tell us who you are. l come from Venus. l see. But Venusians don't live on Earth. How did you get here? l was among those who escaped to Earth... on our planet's final day. When was that? Five thousand years ago. Five thousand years ago! How could you live that long? l couldn't, of course. At least not in physical form. When we reached Earth... and began to assimilate with earthlings... our superior abilities degenerated. Only one remained. Which one? The ability to foresee the future. Doctor! You really believe she's the princess? There's no doubt. She is the princess! Then let's try shock treatment. Shock treatment? Evacuate immediately! Godzilla has demolished the bridge at Shimoochiai! What do we do? We finally found her. We'll carry out our orders. Doctor, what should we do? We have no choice. We can't stop now. lt's Godzilla! Godzilla and Rodan are approaching. Follow police instructions and evacuate immediately! Would you go turn up the voltage to 500? But no higher, or it will kill her. What's wrong? We needn't dirty our hands. Three thousand volts? She'll never survive. Let's check it again. Evacuate! Godzilla's coming! Godzilla! - Everything's set. - Then let's start. - You're sure it's at 500? - Yes. - What's going on? - A power outage? l'll go check. Doctor! Assassins! We made it in time. You stay here. Go around front! Run for it! Doctor, it's safe now. - Are you all right? - l'm fine. Anyone here? Hold it! There you are! You idiot! What are you doing here? - Mothra is coming! - What? Don't just stand there! Help us! Doctor, where's your staff? Right behind us. You said Mothra was coming? Why? To fight King Ghidorah. We must leave before death and destruction rain down upon us. What did her treatment reveal? As you see, she's still a Venusian. Stop the car! Mothra's here! Everyone out! Quick! Up the hill! Hold this. Mothra's talking to them. What do you think she's saying? How would l know? l don't speak monster! What's she saying? She's trying to persuade them, but they're not convinced. "Let's stop fighting each other. Let's join forces and protect the Earth from King Ghidorah." Do Godzilla and Rodan agree? No, they say they don't care. They say it's none of their business. Damn them! Those bastards! Godzilla's saying, "We have no reason to help humans. Humans are always bullying us." Rodan says he agrees. Out of the way! Selfish bastards! Ghidorah! Stop! Come back! Mothra is saying, "Let's let bygones be bygones." But Godzilla and Rodan each demand that the other apologize. Even so, Mothra's not giving up. Those idiots! lt seems humans aren't the only stubborn ones! Be careful ahead! What's going on? The road's blocked! Matsunoki Pass is the only way. Come on, quick! Have they agreed yet? No, but they're close. We should move up higher too. Come on, let's keep moving! "The Earth doesn't belong to humans alone. lt's ours too, and we should defend it." They're almost convinced. No, they're not. They failed to agree? Mothra is going to fight alone. That's impossible! Help, Godzilla! Help, Rodan! Good luck, Mothra! Godzilla and Rodan are going to fight! Hey, the princess has disappeared! Let's look for her. l'll go this way. Fire, fire! We can't go this way either! O mighty Creator of the universe! Save this planet from the evil fiend who destroyed Venus. Save it from becoming a lifeless tomb. Princess! Your Highness, get down! Malmess, you traitor! You remember who you are now? Who are you? A police officer, and your bodyguard. l'm okay. What's that? My brother's raincoat! Brother! Shindo! Go get a rope from that hut on the pass. Okay! Run! We have nowhere to go! Doctor! What should we do? - Don't panic. Our village is done for. Avalanche! A word or two before you go? Did l really say l was from Venus? Yes, but you were perfectly sane the whole time. And your prophecy came to pass. No earthling could have done that. But how did l get my memory back? lt was the bullet's impact. You were shot here. Luckily it only grazed you. ls it possible l'll regain those powers someday? l really couldn't say. Such matters are beyond our understanding. Thank you, Shindo. You saved my life three times. Three times? At the hotel... at the lab... and when l was shot. You remember what happened at the hotel and the lab? l remember nothing else. Only that you saved me. l don't know why. l'll never forget what you did. Your Highness... l wish you a long and happy life. Thank you so much. Good-bye, everyone! We're going back to lnfant lsland. Good-bye! THE END
