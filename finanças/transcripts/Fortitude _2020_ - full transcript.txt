Roque, where were you? At a friend's house, dad. -What happened to you?! -I got robbed. Roque! I'm coming. Where's my car? Well, Roque... what are we going to do about this? I don't know, mom. You aren't going to change, right? You think this is fair? Look at how exhausted we are. Well it's not all my fault, Caracas has become impossible to live in, you can't go out, can't do anything. Look at me Roque. That doesn't happen to me, because I'm not out drinking all night. I'm sorry I have to do this... But we can't take it anymore. It hurts me so much... But you must leave, Roque. I would appreciate that you leave by noon. Hello. I brought this list. That's it? Give me five more cartons of Del Rey... and a bottle of rum. 120 dollars. Okay. -Do you place international calls? -No, you can't make calls. Come on. Let's smoke a cigarette. -Hey! -Damn Roque! There you are! How are you doing old man? You're really thin. What happened? -Diabetes... -Diabetes? Fuck man! It's hit you hard! Do you have it under control? Yeah, taking the medicine. Shit man! It's so good to see you! -Let's sit. -Ok. Are you hungry? Want something? Coffee? -Sure, okay. -Give us some coffee. -So great to see you. -Yeah... How's your son? He's in Canada. Studying? -No, working on his movies and stuff. -Really? Yeah, he wants to come here and see if we can make - he wants to make a movie here... -I want to work in that movie. -Sure. If they're going to pay, I'm not working for free. So how's business? Things are a bit tough. Yeah? How so? I've seen many rafts working. It's not that, but since the Colombian guerrillas arrived... -Shit. -I had six rafts, but they took two. They check every step you take, they investigate you, go to your house, check your room... They're crazy. I might leave it all to them, go elsewhere maybe. No way. Did you bring me some rum? Fuck... no, I didn't bring you any rum, but... Fuck you're tough! -I brought what you like. -Shit, thanks man. You saved my lungs, I was low on carbon monoxide. You'll breathe better now! Thanks brother. I appreciate it. And what are you doing around here? Well, not much, I came... To your lodge? -Yeah. To see if... -There are bushes all over. Oh really? Some houses fell down, a few walls... I can imagine, it's been so many years. It's all abandoned. -It's really that terrible? -Yes. -And Cheo never came back. -Fuck. So that shit must be a snake pit... -Seriously. -Full of wasps. Fuck... all over, the bathrooms! There's a nest this high. -Damn! -It's dangerous. Did you see the gold we're finding now? -Yeah man... -Thanks! -Cheers! -Cheers. Give me a drink. -Of course. -What happened to the dog? I shot him. He bit my niece. I asked my brother if he wanted me to kill it. The black one. Who do I have to kill? Kill that dog for me, he said. I thought it was a guy, not a dog. it was the white one, I grabbed the rifle... Went for his back legs so he would suffer a bit... Then he said, why didn't you kill him? But he had to suffer like my niece. He bit her butt... That same dog bit my cousin. It bit a chunk off... It was a half-bred Chow-Chow. Those are carnivores. It was a bad dog. I had to kill it. Honey, bring some water. It's for my friend. This is a hard business... Every gram counts. I'm going to give you some, it's for your son. I remember he looked like 'Salserin'. Thanks honey. Tell him it's from me. Don't keep it! It's for my nephew. Alright. I'm going to give him forty grams. Better yet, I'm buying my part... as an actor in that movie your son wants to make... Alright. It's quite a bit, Yoni. I've been working with gold for years. There, ready. We mark his forty grams or what? Or should I send it to him on Facebook? No way, better give it here. If you go party tonight, we know you'll come back without it. Damn... Want some water? I'm ok, thanks. Some rum? -No way. -You are being a pussy today? Well, you know how it is... What? You became Adventist... Or Christian, what the fuck's going on? No, I'm just taking it easy. What do you mean taking it easy? You know... easy going, relaxed. I need to think now, stay cool. Think about what, man? Let's remember the good times, when we were young. Let's party, let's fuck girls, go for it all, this way, that way... what the fuck is going on? Let's smoke a joint... Didn't you bring some? I've got some good stuff, man... Know what? I've been growing it... Yeah... The laughing smoke! Leudys! Did you bring water from the spring? Yeah, from the ravine... Give me some, I haven't had any... The water has become a fucking problem, if it's not microbes it's Malaria, Yellow fever, Zika... We are fucked. Where's this water from? From the ravine you pointed out. Let me verify my shit... I don't want dirty water. This water is from Ezequiel's. It's contaminated. You told me to get water from the ravine. I want natural water! This is contaminated. It's worth shit! Why would you give me dirty water? Are you crazy? Go get me natural water from my spring. How could you? You know I'm diabetic, if I catch malaria, I'm fucking dead! She thinks she's so fucking smart... Move it! I'm fucking thirsty! Fuck. Trying to poison me... fucking women. Hey you. -Hi. -How are you? -Fine. -Cool? Did you clean everything up? Yeah, a tree fell down, look. Apparently there was a storm... and it broke. We came to get you. -Really? -Yeah. -Is your mom here? -Yeah. Okay. I didn't bring much... 30 or 40 kilos of chicken, I'll send you more during the week... maybe eight gasoline barrels. Whenever is good. You know it's all money. -I had to work magic to find this... -Yeah? I'll need more next week... 800 kilos. Let me talk to a friend in Caracas. Just put it together... Juan Luis! Quiet! When you get busy, they start bothering and talking... Well, kids are kids, can't change that. Done. Ok, 210. -Want some rum? -Yeah, sure. -Leudys, bring the rum. -Coming. Take that in the bag and put it away... Lend me your phone I want to call Jorge. -Have a drink first. -What? -Have a drink! -C'mon! It seems you're looking at a snake or something. Alright... cheers. You faggot, piece of shit. Just so you know. When you were heartbroken and shit, I told you asshole! I told you to get your ass here! Nothing, I'm doing my thing. Just the way I like it. Misbehaving, fuck. Remember... I miss you a lot. I may be doing some shit... Maybe I can get a flight to Canada, pussy! Can you imagine your father in Canada! You fuck! Give me what you've got. -Give me some... -But you put the cigarette out. Just one. A blow like this. Fuck you beat me. Listen to the crickets. Listen to that shit. Hey man! I'm here... waiting for you, kid! If you can't get gold over there, I'll get it for you here. And I'll make you an Oscar, you fucking pussy! Goddammit! Fuck, we're waiting for you, kid! Where are you? Motherfucker! Rodrigo! Rodrigo! Where is my bottle? Mr. Roque! Who's there? We were going down with some guys. I don't know why there's so many people around here. Well, they're looking for the mine. Is your friend visiting or what? Yeah, he's a good friend, from Caracas. I've known him for years... What are you doing here? I got here a little while ago, to fix up a lodge that I have here... -Lodge? -Akare-Meru. Strange times for tourism, aren't they? Well, maybe things will change... I just came for a chance, you know, to finish the lodge. But I'm running out of money... Chance? Just say what's on your mind. Well, I found the camp... shit. A lot worse than I thought. It was destroyed... I didn't think it would be as bad. I told you that shit was abandoned. I'm trying to see if I can get a chance to make some money and be able to continue... otherwise I'm wasting my time here... You want to work in the mine? For a while, yeah. Everyone comes here for something else... Yeah, I know what you're here for. You've got a chick there... You got an eye on her... No way, you know I'm not into that. Oh but I know, I know how it is. You've got your eye on a woman... No man, that's just gossip. Gossip? I saw you the other day. It's no gossip. How long do you want to stay? Just for a while, man. I just want to repair the lodge... But tell me, how long can you... Fuck, I don't know, whatever it takes... A little while, I guess. I don't know... It all depends. If we nail it, it'll be quick because... I'd get the money fast. Maybe three months, or four, who knows... Well, since you're my friend, I'll give you a chance. But like I told you before, don't you go letting me down, don't make me look bad... it's hard work... but you can make good money too. That's the idea. Get some money fast, and stay to do my thing. Of course. I'm going to help you because you are my friend. That's great, excellent. Yeah... Let's do it. So... shall we have some rum? Want some rum? It's muddy. Can you see it? Not much... I saw the rug yesterday... made quite a bit. Sure, or was it outrageous gold? No, there's no such thing. So what happened? Were you there when they put in the mercury? I did it, but... the bucket stayed there last night. I'm going to find out. Saul! Put it in the fire. Put it there or the smoke will fuck us. Hang on. Put it on the side. Man, there's nothing. There was more. I don't know what happened. Do you know what happened? I saw him with the mercury... Who was doing it yesterday? You? I saw the rug. It was full, really full. You're a partner too. You gotta be on the lookout. That's your job, you're the foreman. It's hot. Still? 9.8. Damn. See for yourself. Ok, it's all here, one, two, three, four, five... This is mine. Here. -Take that. -Thanks, boss. For you. Cool. Hey man. Get in! Let's go. Nice one, Pale Face! Good aim. See how you hit it! It's Richard's turn. How's the game? -All good! -Cool! -What's up, old man! -Did he hit it? -Good movie? -Yes. -Can I join? -Sure. -Hey you. -Your beard grew a lot. Yeah, see that? I haven't trimmed it. What happened to his eye? -The doctor said it's the water. -The water? Yes, since they are mining, it could be the mercury that hurt his eyes. But you weren't playing with that, huh? -No. -Can't touch that stuff. It's poison. There's another woman who has gone blind, in both eyes. I have to take him in before it gets worse. It's been over a year. They said I have to take him to Caracas for a surgery, but it's very expensive. Maybe I can talk to a friend who's a doctor, he knows a lot of people and we can see what he says. Maybe he can help? Yeah. Roque, I have to talk to you. Don't be a pussy! Come on man, hit him hard! Kill it! -How are you? -Fine. -What happened to you last night? -Nothing... Where's uncle Yoni? I don't know. Careful with the current and let me know when you reach the bottom. to check the stuff on the sieve. Okay. -Fire it up. -Coming. -It grew a lot. -Yes... Accelerate a bit... Check it out... Yeah, it's good. Let go, man! What's wrong pussy? No! That asshole has been stealing from us! Grab this! -Grab this. -I said no! Grab it, I'm telling you! You're fucking crazy! If he comes out, I'll shoot him... Listen to it... That bird is a bad omen. It's a bad bird. See, it's all quiet... because there is no life. Have a drink! Pacheco! Shit, the fucking music man! The music is playing, man. Can't you hear it? You deaf? Lighter. So you like working with me? You've been able to save like you wanted... You're getting me into trouble. What trouble? I don't want you to spend money on booze and whores. You wanna party? I'll pay for it and I'll party too. Got it? And another thing. About what happened in the river... With that guy, Saul. He was stealing from me... So I killed him. You started to cry like a pussy. That's what happens to people that screw me... they get killed. Don't get like that! Is he your family or what? He was just a dog, and dogs die every day. He was stealing. And nobody steals from me. You got that? Listen to the crickets... Do you have the balls to shoot me, bitch? Leudys! Leudys! What's up? What happened to you? Open up... I wanted to give you this. But... I can't stay long... They're going to say things about me that aren't true... ok? Say bye to Juan Luis for me. Where you going? Why are you giving me this? To help you both. Shit. Nothing but branches, branches, branches! Branches! Goddamned branches and leaves. Roque! -Hi. -Hello. -Do you take raw gold? -Sure. Leo! -Leo! -Coming! Fucking cigarettes, I've had enough... -Huh? -I want to quit. -Really? -Yeah. -They're going to kill me. -They've gotten expensive. You can't imagine how much a pack costs in the jungle. Oh I can imagine... You have to pay with gold. Everything must be a fortune... -It is... -They only accept gold... Their economy is based on gold. -It's based on dust and pebbles... -Yeah. Prices are in grams, that's how it is. Sure. So... It's all expensive! Life has always been expensive there, and dangerous. -I brought some good stuff. -Yeah? -Let's see. -Alright. Hello. Hey! George! -What's up dad? How are things? -Good, and you? -Cool, can you hear me? -Yeah... -Is it cold in Canada? -It's freezing. Yeah... -How have you been? -I'm fine, working a lot... And what have you been doing? Well... Just work, what else... Doing what, man? Hi Emma! It's your grandfather! I'm gonna put this one down. So tell me, have you spoken with your grandparents? Yeah, they asked about you the other day. -Yeah? -Uh-huh. What did they say? That they haven't heard from you in a while. -Yeah. -I see... Well, I just wanted to say that... Uh... ...that I love you very much. Oh well, me too. I wish I could go visit you. I miss you so much. Subtitling: FAST TITLES MEDIA
