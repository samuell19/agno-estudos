I'm a family man. I... I'm not even saying I don't have faults. [sniffs] It's just... Everybody's capable of redemption, you know. You... Nobody has to be crucified for a few mistakes they make in a moment of weakness when they didn't know any better. Look, all I know is that I... I was just driving home from work. I was just driving home from work. And... I blacked out. Then when I woke up, I was in that place, and I... God, there was so much blood. [breaths heavily] There was so much fucking blood. [breathing heavily] No. No. No. What part of this are you not understanding? I did not murder these people. I'm not capable of taking a life. You talk about taking someone's life almost like you're stealing it from them. Almost like it was theirs in the first place, which is simply not the case. You people are all just fancy packages of flesh. The contents of which being your soul. Freedom of will is just a blank address. The one who did the wrapping is hoping it stays blank and gets a big, fat stamp on it that says... "Return to sender." Yeah. I don't understand. [man 2] Hmm. Listen... you're in some deep, deep shit. However, we can make that all go away. [ominous instrumental] What do you need me to do? Just... fill out that blank address. [woman] Don't touch that pen. - Who are you? - Don't listen to her, kid.

[Professor Crawley] Hey, Daniel. Long time no see. How are you, my young grasshopper? I'm hanging on there... Hanging in there. I'm hanging in there. Have you taken the lessons that I've taught and applied them to your everyday life? What? Have you pulled from the plethora of everyday knowledge I've bestowed upon you? The pool of my experience and created a destiny of excellence for yourself? Profess Crawley, you... You taught, uh, wood shop. And have you learned nothing? Life is wood. Yeah. Okay. Um... To what do I owe the pleasure, Professor? While contemplating life and truly delving into the issues of humanity, I may have neglected to enter your final exam for your graduating class, rendering your final grade null and void. What... what... What does that mean? Sadly, your diploma is invalid. Professor, I don't... I took your class for an extra credit. How is this even happening? [Professor Crawley] Ironic. Meet me this afternoon so we can go over the material and what to do going forward. I can't, I have work. I can't. Some people don't even have the opportunity to work, Dan. Take some initiative for once in your life. I can't just not go to work, Professor, to come pick up a... [Professor Crawley] I'll see you soon. - [phone beeping] - No, you... - Hey, Dan, I'm home. - Oh, my God. Thanks, Lars. [breathing heavily] [tap squeaking] Dan, there's so much lint on my balls right now. It's, uh... it's like one of those, like, sticky hands that you get out of those 25 cent machines. Hey, Dan, I'm scared to take a shit. What if... what if when I stand up my balls stick to the toilet seat and then they, like, snap back and they slap me in the face? Dan, - Dan, Dan! - What? Can you give me some baby powder? Lars, just hop in the shower, bud. And your problem's gonna be solved, right? Yeah. Yeah, no, that probably... That'll fix it. ["Stepping Stone" by Red Linen Antler resumes playing] [burps] [Satan] I'm so glad you asked, Timmy. See, cancer is a terrible disease that slowly kills you from the inside. [Timmy] My fucking grandma died of cancer. Little boys get it when they don't play a healer and let their DPS characters die. [Timmy speaking indistinctly] Uh, yeah, sure. You know what? Why don't you put your mom in the chat? - I'd love to speak with her. - [Timmy] Mom. [giggles] [Sarah over the phone] Excuse me. Did you... Hey, Sarah. That he was going to get cancer? - Oh. - I cannot believe that. Do you understand his father died from cancer? Well, can I... -Do you have any sympathy... -Can I talk now? Okay. Well, when I was 13 like your kid, I led a rebellion against my father. I say, "Fuck you, Dad." I got cast out of heaven. I dressed up like a snake, convinced two nudists to have sex to... To introduce sin into the world, then I had that all spoiled by a circumcised hippie who got murked by his own people, so... But, you know, I did manage to open up the world's most successful sauna/penitentiary in history. So... yeah. Uh, I think your kid got lots of catching up to do, Sarah. - You are a grown man. - And another thing, just... - You're... you're a grown man. - Suck my big fat dick. [sniffs] [breathy screaming, Sarah screaming] [laughs evilly] Hey, Dan, how's it hanging? Dan? Hey. Dan. Don't ignore me, I'm fragile. Dan. Hey, Dan. Why the cold shoulder, buddy? [Dan] I gotta go to the university now. 'Cause I guess some professor I had two years ago fucked my grade or something, I don't know. Oh, boy. Howdy. I'll tag along. I'll get you that grade in no time. No, I... I can... I can do this myself. [sighs] Jesus. Satan, I asked you to stop putting body parts in the freezer. First of all, I asked you not to use the J word or the G word when you're speaking to me, Daniel. - Got it? - Mm-hmm. Second of all, you know, if I can convince that Epstein guy to kill himself, I can convince your prof of anything. He don't stand a chance. I'm very persuasive. Right, but... we don't need him to kill himself, right? We just need the passing grade. That's it. Sure. We'll go with that. Okay, fine. But can we please just stop putting fingers in the freezer? But finger food. [laughs] Let me hear you say it, Dan. Finger food. All right, fine. But don't be surprised if you start finding frozen dicks in the freezer. You know, they're a delicacy in some countries. I'll be going at that shit like a popsicle. Like... [licking noise] If it was yours, it'd be like... [sucking noise] Yeah, but it's fine. - Where are you going? - I gotta go. Hold up, speed racer. Don't leave without me. Dan, I'm telling you let me handle this guy. No, man, every time we have you get involved, somebody gets hurt. I don't want anybody to get hurt this time. No one's gonna get hurt. I'm just gonna, you know, convince him to give it to you. - You mean scare him? - Yeah, sure. If I wanted him scared, I could just... I would do that myself, okay? I could be intimidating. Dan, I'm more scared of a Karen asking to speak to a manager than you. That's... that's bullshit. No, look, I'll show you. I can be scary. Watch. Let's hear it. Lay it on me, man. Hey, prof, if you don't give me a good... The... the best grade in the class, I'm gonna hurt you so bad your head's gonna spin. See? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that was pretty good. Pookie, you're... you're scary. You're... You're real scary, buddy. No, that was really shit and not good. This is how it's done, Dan. [imitating Dan] Fucking hate that. Listen here, you sack of shit. If you don't fix your own mistake right now, I'm gonna bend you over on this desk and ass rape you. Then instead of pulling your hair for excitement, I'm gonna gouge your fucking eyes out and skull-fuck you 'til you're screaming my name so fucking loud everyone in this university can hear it. Then I'm gonna light a cigar and I'm gonna smoke the cigar and I'll put it out in your fucking chest. And to put the cherry on top, I'm gonna bust a fucking nut in the bird hole. I just feel like I would never say that. And what... What if that doesn't work? [Satan screams breathily] That actually could work, but no, still no. [Satan exclaims] You're no fun anymore. Oh, come on, Dan. We're not picking up this nut job again, are we? Come on, Satan, have a heart, man. I mean, she... I don't have a soul. Why would I have a heart? Think about it. Use your head, Dan. All right. That's on me, I guess. But she... I mean, she just lost her license. We're going to the same place, we live in the same apartment complex. It's... it's a work courtesy. Are you at least gonna make her say, [moaning] "Oh, Daniel." No, no, I'm not gonna do that, so... "Daniel." She wouldn't say that 'cause I'm not gonna do that. [moaning loudly] "I've never seen four inches go so far." You and I both know it's four and a half so that's, uh... [high-pitched moaning] None of this is gonna... I'm not doing it. This is you. [sing-song moaning] "My beloved, I shall take you to insemination station." These are things you would say, not... I wouldn't say that. "Excelsior!" I'd... I've never said that once my whole life. - Mm. - Oh, she's right there. You gotta go in the back. You gotta go. She's coming. [moaning] - You gotta get... - Fine. - You're not riding shotgun. Okay, there's a simpler way to do this. The car has doors. Yeah. Okay. [Satan] I'm sorry I'm not as limber as I used to be. I noticed. Could you be less graceful? [Satan] Oh. Oh, shit. I'm stuck. - Oh, shoot. She appears... - [Satan] Okay. I got it. - She appears to be okay. - [Satan] Ow! Fucker. - Hey, Dan. - Hey, Karl. [Satan] Welcome to the clown car, crazy pants. Thanks for taking me to work again. I really can't lose another job, you know, lizard people. - Hey, Karl, did you... - [Satan] It's for you. You didn't say lizard people, right? Well, reptile people to be more inclusive, but... I'm good. Anyway, one of them was disguised as a cop and, uh, before he could get to me I crawled through the backseat, in my tin foil-lined trunk, only to be found again. But... but not before I was able to slip on my bullet/ incubation-proof vest. So, do you think I'm gonna need this? I can't see why you would. Anyway, nice glasses. Thanks. They're prescription. - [pills rattling] - Oh, shit. Wait... wait. Oh, you okay? [pills rattling] Karl, what's going on? - You okay? - [Satan] Look out. - You're gonna get stabbed. - [Dan] I really hope not. I... I pro... I swear I brought it. - Please tell me what's wrong. - Oh, my God, okay. - Oh, that did it. Huh? - Yeah. Okay. Word up, I guess. Um, Karl, I... I feel like that's all gotta be in your head, right? That's impossible. My dad says there's nothing in my head. Although my mom does think he's just gaslighting me so I don't get swamp-monstered like she did. Swamp-monstered. I... I, um... what... what is that? [giggles] It's... it's when you get porked in the porta potty at a music festival and get pregnant. - Come on. - Of course it is. Um, is it... Is it the porking itself or the... the pregnancy that's the swamp monster? I don't know, actually. Huh. - So, are you gonna drive or? - Yeah, no, of course. I'm gonna drive, that's what we're in the car for. [customer] I need to be able to sync it to the setting, but I don't see it, can you help me out, please? [clerk] Oh, you know what? I see your problem. See that, that's a sign for blue balls, you know. When your... when your wife ain't putting out. So, you know, you keep your side bitches in the burner phone. [customer] Look, what is my six-year-old son gonna do with a phone for adultery? All right. I'll give you ten bucks. I paid 70 for it. It's like a used car, man. You take it off the lot and starts depreciating. That's it. I'm done. That's it. I'm depreciating attitude right now. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Great. Great. Good for you. I mean, this is... what kind of... Look, and one of your employees is molesting one of your female coworkers. Come on. What the fuck are you two doing? This ain't cousin Clyde's trailer park. Get the fuck off each other. Jesus. Come on. Uh, Dan, you can get off me now. [customer] Look at me. I'm reporting you to the Better Business Bureau, so good luck. All right, hold on. Hold on. I'll give you 20 bucks for the phone. How do I put this in the most professional manner possible? You can't be feeling your coworker's titties, Dan. Sir, I wasn't. I... I... She was falling down. I was trying... I was trying to stop her from breaking her neck. You put on quite a show out there. [chuckles] I... I wouldn't be surprised if some bastard in a suit just starts knocking on my fucking door, asking questions. [clerk sighs] I... I gotta fire one of you. Now, if you can explain to me why you were tickling her titties... No, it was my fault. I'll take the fault. Listen here, Dan. You're a good kid. Well, I don't actually know that. To be honest, I don't pay much attention to either of you. You're just like these flies that buzz around me, you know, while I'm trying to do my thing and you just do your thing and... I don't know, it's just... You're just not that interesting. But anyway, I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you fly free on the winds of change or what have you, so you can just pack your things and just get out. I don't have anything to pack. I... I don't have a locker here. Oh, well, it'll go a lot faster, then. Good luck to you. [softly snores] [Dan struggling with car door] - [car door shutting] - Lunchtime. We do lunch now? No. All right. There... there's no... There's no lunchtime. I just got fired. [laughs] Really? Yep. Dan, you might wanna go ask for your job back. I'm a bit of a clothes horse and we could use the income. - You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. We could use the income. Look, I... I gotta go to the university. All right? You down for a ride? Yeah, let's do it, baby. I'm coming. [grunts] Just... Of all the times... Of all the times to use that... That annoying teleport thing you do, you never think to do it in my car. It's not nearly as funny, Dan. ["Through the Night" by Brody Sayed playing] ♪ I can't see anything tonight ♪ ♪ Stop lurking and start... ♪ [phone ringing] Hello. [Melissa] Hi, sweetie. I just got back from Mrs. Jeffrey's funeral. Pastor Connors gave a beautiful eulogy. She had no other family members, you know, and the spread afterwards was truly delightful, - really... - That's good, eh? I know how you get when an event doesn't have a good spread. Oh, well, like I've always said, it's the essence of the party. Anyway, when I was walking out of church, I was approached by two very strange men in the parking lot dressed as ghosts. And they started asking about you. Do you have any idea who they are? Can't say I know anybody that fits that description, Mom. Well, it got me thinking about you and now I'm looking at old photos of you. Oh, you were so cute. Thanks, Mom. When are you coming to visit? Uh, I don't know. I... Th... things are getting kind of hectic right now, you know? I was thinking, I have a little extra money now that your dad has passed away and... And I could really use some help on the farm. You should come home just for a little while to reset. Yeah. I'll think about it, Mom. That would just mean the world to me and the goats. - They miss you, too. - Hey, Ma, I gotta go. Okay? I'll call you back. [car brake screeching] What the fuck? No, no, no, no, no. Turn around. Jaywalker, we gotta run his ass over. - Come on, go, Dan. - Take it easy, motorhead. - Run him over. - I'm not running him over. [music playing faintly] [Satan] So, what is this guy? Some creepy Kevin Spacey motherfucker? [Dan] Pretty much it. I think he just likes girls, though. - Other than that, though, yeah. - [Satan] Yeah. Professor. Time to die, douchebag. No, no, no. I'm kidding. It's a joke. Or is it? I don't know. I know you don't. I never do. This is ridiculous, right? Like, he asked me to come. [Professor Crowley chattering] And... Professor, I'm here to talk about my final exa... - Oh, Christ. - [Satan gasps loudly] You're not my wife! - You're married? - What, no, shut up. Blackmail. [Dan] And I'm a sex offender now. [Satan] Well, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place. Congratulations. You passed the class. And now so are you. I can trust you to delete that later, right? For her sake, of course. Professor, you're... You are poking me. [upbeat classical music playing] [coffee machine whirring softly] That was a complete waste of fucking time. Looking at the glass half empty, Dan. We did get to see that old guy's clock weights get readjusted, if you know what I'm saying. You don't get to see that shit every day. Yeah. I'm... I'm aware. I'm very glad I don't get to see that every day. Okay? Because it was disgusting. And if I can be frank, it speaks to the integrity of that school. Well, don't blame the school.

That was two years ago. Not after what I did to her, okay? You know, you never did tell me what happened on that date. Just kept talking about that girl for weeks at a time and all of a sudden she's masturbation material? Spill it. Well, that depends. Um, if it's a smaller project, it could take a couple of weeks. But if it's a larger one, it might take me a couple months for planning and then a few months after that, just to, um... finish it.

I'm not stalking you anytime. So, I'm... I'm just here to get coffee. That's what I'm here for. Come on, Dan, lay down some sexy shit. Put on the moves. Show her what it's like to have hot rhino's blood pumping through your cock. You look amazing. - [Satan] God. - [Lilly] Yeah. You said that already. Well, didn't you know that incest was a lot less frowned upon in, uh, earlier centuries, particularly a... among royalty, for instance? Excuse me? No, 'cause, um, the, uh... The... that post that you posted about your sister and how you love her so much, like, it might even be weird. And... and so, like, incest just... And now I have... gave it to you. Dan, I posted this, like, six months ago and I'm pretty sure I blocked you, like, two years ago after you left me at that restaurant. Wait, you did what now? It's... it's... it's not so, uh, difficult to make a second account, though, I mean. [snorts] You made a second account just to creep on me? Would you like a shovel for the hole you're digging, sir? You okay, Dan? Daniel, what are you doing? That was harder to watch than Europe during the black plague and I had front row seats to that shit. Believe me. I know, man. I... I... I... What do I do?

I debated whether or not I should... sue you or put a hit out on you just to get it over with. But no, no, no. I took the high road. I blocked you. Which clearly you found ways around that. I mean, you gotta admit I'm pretty persistent, right? Yeah. You're definitely pushing boundaries in the stalker territory.

The only way to create life-altering epiphanies in the human world is to scare their little asses. You know, with ghosts and shit. I see. I see. Well, keep up the good work and keep me posted, will you? Listen, I... Otherwise I'm gonna have to come visit this Dan character myself and you know how that goes. All right. It makes me nervous. And when I'm nervous, I'm not my normal regal self. Do I make myself clear? And do you understand? Okay, boss. Understood. [Michael] No soul left behind. No soul left behind. One more time with feeling. [Gabriel] No soul left behind. No soul left behind. [Gabriel] No soul left behind. Atta boy. Michael out. [phone thudding] Ferdinand... make me feel good. [sniffing] [exhales] Oh, yeah. That's the stuff. Shit. [thudding] Okay, Dan. I was reviewing the highlights of that little mishap that happened earlier today only to conclude that your game is royally fucked up, buddy. Reminded me of the time that I watched all the animals drown that didn't make it on the Ark. But this time, instead of laughing at you and... poking you with a stick... I'm gonna help you. - You're gonna help me? - Hell, yeah. Yeah, you did help me at the café and look what happened, man. Well, you just don't have any confidence in yourself. That's all. But that's your problem, not mine. Besides, all is not lost. You heard that girl. There's supposed to be a party happening tonight, you gotta make an appearance. Yeah, I heard what she said and I also heard that she doesn't wanna see my face ever again. Okay? Also, I do not want to get my ass beat by some hood rat tonight. - [blows whistle] - Oh, my God. - It's such a small room, dude. - [Satan] Shh, shh. Shut your fucking mouth. This time, let me hold the reins. Huh? I can solve all your problems. No, man, no. We've talked about this. The last time, Satan, you cannot possess my mortal soul. Flag on the field. It's not a flag. It's such a reasonable play. Listen, up until now you've captained a dinghy that has treaded, shall we say, shallow waters. Let me be your Nemo and navigate your submarine 40,000 leagues under the sea. And by submarine I mean your penis. My penis, I know you do. All right. I was worried gonna have to draw you a picture. [Dan] No, shit. But look, this whole thing is your fault anyway. Yeah. What happens every time I listen to you? What happens? I get swept up into some kind of a wacky misadventure and I just end up getting fucked. I... I don't know why I ever listened to you before. [Satan] Poor Danny. Always going through the motions, huh? Creating fantasies in his mind, but never acting on his impulses or even acting at all. What was your degree in again? Uh, oh, hold on. Political science in theater. And what you doing with that, huh? You lighting Broadway on fire with your FDR musical? Roosevelt, exclamation point! Look, man, my fucking life is falling apart. Okay? What do you want from me? - I'm trying. - Oh, you're trying? Are you? But are you really? Are you really? Look the fuck around you, man. All you do is sit at home on your ass having a circle jerk with Lars over that Lilly bitch, who you're stalking, by the way. Meanwhile, chronically masturbating until your dick looks like it belongs on a crocodile. All right. Meanwhile, that little hood rat is living your dream, man. Get a grip. Fuck, first of all, don't call her a bitch. - All right. - Ooh, hit a nerve? Second of all, that whole fucking bullshit was a low blow. All right, there's no reason to say shit like that. [Satan] You are... you're right. Hey. Hey. Did I... did I hurt your feelings? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, here. Why don't you jerk off some more? That'll solve all your problems. What the fuck are you attacking me for, huh? What have you been trying to do for the last couple millennia? Take over the world still? How's that coming along? Huh? From the inside of my fucking closet. You know, that's it. That's it. You really need to add to your little Kleenex collection, you cum wad. All I've ever tried to do is help you, Danny. All right? But it's over. I wash my hands of you, Danny. I expel you of the burden I put on your miserable life. You might as well marry your right hand and have a bunch of deformed half-hand, half-pussy, loser children. And hey, if the cell phone career doesn't pan out, you can always tour the countryside doing puppet shows with your freak Carney family. Your kids could be finger puppets. [cackles] [Dan] Get the fuck outta here, man. [laughs hysterically] Dan, did you hear what I said? [Dan] Yeah. I fucking heard you, man. - Get out. - Finger puppets! Yes, I heard you. Get the fuck out. Get out of my room. Get out of my house. Get out of my closet. Just get the fuck out of my life. [panting] - Hey, Lars. - Looking good. [Lars] Hey, go get it, girls. Oh, damn. Get it. Oh, God, dude. [muffled speech] Exactly right, Lars. God. Please, follow. Uh, okay. [ominous music] [footsteps approaching] Sit. - Sit. - [Lars] Okay. So, Lars, you want some "peanus"? Sorry, some what now? You know, some salty peanuts. [chuckles] Oh. Peanuts. Yes, of course. [laughs] - Eat, eat, delicious... - No, no, no. That's okay. I'm, um... you know, I got my fill of nuts today. Oh. So, why'd you bring me here? Why did I follow you? [clear speech] Your friend is in grave danger. Uh, which one? Wait, what happened to your voice? You know, the sad pathetic one. Looks like a poster child for antidepressants. - Oh, Dan? - Yes, exactly. Wait, but how do you know he's in trouble? Let's just say we have a mutual friend. [TV show playing in the background] [Satan whistles] [clears throat] Hey. So, I was thinking about that talk we had earlier and, um, oh, you're right. We can be... both be so stupid sometimes. And... and we really act out. Hey. Buds? - No. - Bring it on in. - Come on. - No, no. - Oh, come on. - No man. You... first of all, I never even said that. Second of all, you... you always do this to me. You... you twist everything around and you make me confused and make me look like I'm the bad... Look at you. Look what you're covered in. You routinely kill and eat people. I'm a person. If you popped up in my neighbor's closet, would you come and kill and eat me? You're the devil. You're the original bad guy. You're literally Satan. I mean, God, what do you... How many times do I have to tell you please not to use that fucking word when you're speaking to me?! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I know. I know. I know. I hear you. I hear you, but I'm trying. Okay? I'm really trying to change. I swear. Hell, I'll even swear to Go... I'll swear to Go... - I wanna hear it. - I'll get it. I'll swear to God if I have to and you know how much I hate that fucking guy. I do. Daniel... you have brought something out in me... something I didn't even know I had or existed. It's kindness, Dan. Kindness. You brought that out in me, and I'm forever grateful. And... and all I wanna do is... is to return the favor. I am forever changed. [body thudding] I'm pretty sure she's still alive. Yep. I'm sure she'll be kicking any minute now, buddy. Hey. Hey. Hey. Um, we'll come back to this. Um, just, don't... sorry. Uh, don't forget the conversation though. You know, kind... kindness. Uh, so sorry. I'm forever changed. Swear to Go... Okay. Come on, you fucker. [TV show playing in the background] [chomping] [tune of "Happy Birthday"] ♪ I'm sorry, Daniel ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry, Daniel ♪ ♪ I'm sorry we're both assholes ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, Daniel ♪ What is this? I'm gonna... I'm gonna open this up and a grenade pin is gonna fall out or something? [door shuts closed] Great. For thousands of years, Satan has corrupted the souls of man out of spite and jealousy. He has been responsible for some of the greatest atrocities of humankind. The great plague. The Holocaust. 9/11. SNL after the 2000s. I knew it. Suffice to say, this guy has some massive fucking daddy issues and no real healthy outlets. But what he wants, what he desires, most of all, is to be born into this world as a man. For it is through his seed that he can create the Antichrist. Whoa. But what happens then? I... I don't actually know for sure, but that shit is definitely bad. It's like... totally not cool. Yo, that's bad news. What... but what does Satan want with Dan? When I was a young boy, Satan came to me as an imaginary friend. Granted, at the time, I had no clue as to what Satan really was, but he was always there to help me and guide me. When things went well because of his advice, they always took a turn for the worst. But I loved the good times so much, that when the bad times came along, I didn't mind. I ignored the signs. Little did I know he was crushing my soul piece by piece. I was taking the easy road, the less ethical path. Eventually, I couldn't cope without his advice. And all my bad decisions came back to bite me in the ass. Finally, I needed him more than anything... which was his plan. So, I let him possess me in an attempt to reproduce... which is what he wanted from the beginning. Holy shit. But I beat him in the end. [laughs] Sadly not before my entire life was ruined. Yeah, sure, sure. But how... How did you defeat him? How did you beat Satan? I was sterile. - Oh, my God. - Mm. That's awful. You know, this actually makes a lot of sense. Just thinking about Dan, I mean, I just thought he was into some, like, weird BDSM shit. Hey, Dan, could I borrow a shirt for my date tonight? "Oh, yeah, sure buddy. You're my best friend. Of course, Lars." Anything for you, I'll just... Oh, go... Behold, a mighty weapon, blessed in holy water and frankincense - carved from what is believed... - Wow. To have been the wood from the cross that Jesus sacrificed himself upon. I picked this baby up in small town in Egypt. [Lars laughs] It's the only weapon known in the universe that can defeat the devil. [laughs] Nice. So, this will like... This'll really kill Satan? Yeah, I'm not so sure about that part either. You've just gotta bash Dan's balls in with this thing if you wanna save him. Oh, whoa. Okay. Uh, what... is there anything else we could do that's not that? Well, you could try to convince him to take up mountain biking. - All right. - Or have a vasectomy. - Ooh, okay. - But... No, that would... That would take too long. No, I'm afraid Dan shooting blanks is the only way to beat the devil and save the world. Save the world. Yes. You see... if there's no certain way to reproduce, huh, he'll just move on to his next host. All right. I can do it. I can bust Dan's balls. [angelic choir music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [coughing] There's my best buddy in the whole goddamn world. [cheering & screaming] This is all for you. [indistinct yelling] Hey, Dan!

[Dan coughs] Uh, why? What's... what's going on? [clears throat] [officer] Well, I... unfortunately, I'm calling to inform you that your... your mom passed away earlier this afternoon. Yeah, so... Are you serious? [officer] Yeah, sir. So, a neighbor found her in the barn behind the house. This, uh... that can't be true. Is there some kind of a mistake? [officer] I'm sorry for your loss, sir. I understand this is terribly shocking news, but, you know, this is a sad reality of... of life that, well, that we all have to go through, so... [sobbing] Do you know how she, uh... [clears throat] How it happened? [officer] Uh, from what... Hold on. Now, from what I'm told here, she says, uh, she was attacked by her goats. [crying] Oh, my God. [officer] That's awkward. Just rare is what it is. We will be, uh, sending you a death certificate by mail in the coming days along with some, uh, information on how to make funeral arrangements and what to do going forward. Okay. Make it easy on you. Uh, Pastor Connors will be having a beautiful eulogy and service prepared for your mother. A truly delightful spread afterwards. Yeah, truly delightful. Okay.

And then he dropped outta college and became whatever the fuck that is in there. Yeah. God, you know what's funny? A guy can just... You can get so, like, infatuated with a girl and it's not healthy. It's... it's a dangerous thing, infatuation. But... but it's like... It's like all the movies and all the books and TV shows, they... they lie to us and... they make us think it is a good thing. Like that all... That all you have to do is be obsessed with a girl and she'll be yours. Like... Like you're entitled to her. [sighs] You know the most fucked up part? Is that you'll... You'll get rejected just over and over and... And then you blame the girl and you... you wanna take it out on her and hurt her 'cause... 'cause she hurt you. [sighs] - Oh, my God! - [papers crackling] It's for you. It's, uh, that's for that night, I just... I wanted to, uh, you know, get some closure, so I could finally move on. Oh, my God! Dan, there's $3,000 in here. Yeah. I... I know you told me that... you had to go to the hospital, therapy and all that, and I know that's not cheap. And I know that's not a lot...

It's... it's... [sighs] No one's ever done anything this nice for me before. Not even Da'Louis. And so you're over me just like that? Like what? - Like... - [Da'Louis] Yo.

You're trying to justify cheating on me because this Brittany bitch says she loves you! Well, she actually likes giving head. You always been complaining, like, "Oh, my mouth hurts." I never asked you to pierce your dick! Oh, well, lots of porn stars got 'em and it never stops him from getting head. Most have like maybe one. Your shit looks like it should be hiding in a puzzle box waiting to murder people, you fucking asshole! [gasps] Oh, hey. Hey, guys. Let's bring it down a notch, huh? As the self-appointed party doctor, I'm gonna have to prescribe some Imodium. What, bitch? Don't even know what you're saying! Uh, "cause you're being a party pooper. - Imodium? - Hmm. Can you get it? He's not getting it. Lilly, what do you say, we ditch logic here and go show JC's mom what she's been missing, yeah? - [Lilly] Yeah. - Hey, motherfucker! I... I don't know how you just magically you grew a set of balls, but I suggest that you take them and you tuck them in between your legs while you walk away before I cut 'em off and feed 'em to my homie Jamal's dog... - [barking] - Bitch! Hey, Da'Louis, there's a great corner over there you can squat on and sell meth, what are you still doing here, big dog? - Dan, stop. - Look. I'm sure he's very upset Mr. White died, okay? But there's just no reason to act like this, buddy. - [punch thuds] - [Da'Louis groaning] - [punch thuds] - [Da'Louis screaming in pain] - Dan? - Yeah. If you want better for yourself, it's up to you to take it. Nobody else. [Da'Louis groaning] [Da'Louis] Okay. Get back here, bitch. [wheezing] I got warrants, so... Let's go. [Da'Louis] You ain't... you ain't never doing better than me. God! Every time you open your mouth, it's like you plant a shit seed in my mind, that grows into an entire shit tree. And then the winds of self-questioning and insecurity blow it's leaves all over my brain, and plant more shit seeds. Before you fucking know it, I have an entire ecosystem living in a goddamn shit forest in my brain that I tried to burn down with alcohol and impulsive decision making. You went to two Wiz Khalifa concerts, Da'Louis. Two! If you were to look up cultural appropriation and misogyny, it would pop up with images of you and the domestic abuse hotline! Oh, and FYI, lasting for a minute and a half, and whispering in my ear, "You're welcome, ho," does not make me cum any faster! I now wait until you fall asleep at, like, six o'clock in the morning just to finish myself off. [laughing] Saving you the embarrassment! It's gotten so bad, the sounds of birds chirping turns me on. [laughing] And so, with that, I say, "Fuck you, and have a nice life!" [clumping footsteps] So... Whoa. Does this mean no head tonight? [sighs] Thank you for that, Dan. - Seriously. - [smacks lips] Don't mention. I wanted to do that since I met the guy. [Lilly laughing] So, what? Are you just some kind of kind, heroic type guy now? What happened to that creep from this morning? I don't know, but, uh, I do a lot of thinking about my priorities and, uh, I think I got 'em straight. - [Lilly] Yeah? - Yeah. That's a lot of growing to do in one day, but I'll take it. So, do you wanna grab a drink or something? Actually, I gotta get some stuff done and then we could just meet at my place in, like, an hour. [scoffs] Okay, look, Dan. I really don't feel comfortable with that. Uh, it's okay. How about this? You're comfortable with this? ♪ [sighs] [sniffs] Okay, your place then. - I'll text you the address. - [Lilly laughs] Uh, wait, Dan! You don't have my number! [Dan] Oh, yes, I do. [Crawley] I'm so happy you decided to join me this evening. [cork popping] Bourbon? [student] Oh, um, Professor, I'm only 20. You mentioned something about extra credit and that you were gonna write me a letter of recommendation. Please... have a drink first. I won't tell if you don't. Um, is this the extra credit? If you want it to be. I was thinking maybe you could do an oral exam. Say, do you see that statue over there? Mm-hmm. That... is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He lost his ability to hear at a very young age, but despite his handicap, he still had an impeccable sex drive and never lost the ability to create masterful symphonies. Some say most of his work exudes sex. What do you say I throw some on, and you tell me if you can hear it? Wasn't Beethoven the deaf one? [laughing] [knock on door] Oh, come on! Now, who the hell could that be at this hour? Nonsense! Absolute nonsense! Stay right here, darling. [clumping footsteps] Dan? Do you have any idea how late it is? I've got a girl in here, man! [shushing] [thud] Jesus, Dan! What the hell is wrong with you? Wrong on both counts, Professor, and I'll tell you... ["Rondo Alla Turca" by Mozart playing] You. Girl. I'm in a good mood tonight. Get outta here. [door creaking] The grade is not worth it, sweetheart. Shit... Always a chase. [Crawley] Shit... [music intensifying] [groaning] Ooh... gnarly. That smarts, huh? Ooh, Mozart. [gasping] Please, Daniel. This isn't right! Why? Wrong again, prof. You know, like you, my concern really isn't with what's right. No, my concern lies more with disgusting predators preying on the shepherd less flock. Naïve young women who think, for whatever reason, these predators have something to offer. Creepy old men walking around deluding themselves into thinking they're living their lives so much better than everybody else. When... when in reality your own colleagues don't even respect ya. You piece of shit! [music continues] "See, through me you pass into the city of woe. Into unending pain. Through me, among those lost for aye. Justice maker of my fabric moved. Behind me, supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me, things create were none, save things. Eternal, and eternal I shall remain." Unlike you. [metal rattling] "Abandon all hope ye who enter here." Fuck you, and fuck Shakespeare! You cunt! [music continues] It's Dante, actually. [Crawley screaming] Not that a fuckwit like you would know that. You need help, Daniel. Serious help, please! Oh... I'm helping Danny boy now. [Crawley snorts] [thudding] ♪ Oops.

Yeah, that'll do. Oh! Oh. Oh, no way! [laughs] Oh, shit, homie. Uh, no way! That's like the holy ground right there. [smacks lips] Oh, that's, like, 100 proof. Oh, that's a fountain of youth.

I'm gonna baptize you in the light of the morning star, bitch! I'm gonna baptize he who had sinned. He who had bitten from the apple. He who lays his hands on falsehoods. And now I lay my hands on you and I'll show you your only salvation, buddy. You getting cold, big guy? You getting cold? It's all right.

[Panting heavily] And now I banish... Fuck! Banish your ass back to hell. Wait a minute. Wait a minute here! A toy sword? - What? No! - [Dan] Yeah, it is. Oh, it's not a toy. It's a collector's item. - [laughing] - [Gabe] What? Let me get this straight. Big guns, upstairs, the big guy he gave Michael what? This epic ancient flaming holy sword. And what did he give you? What, is that from the pawn shop down the street? I can see the tag on it. [laughing] Ha, made you look. I'm getting nothing from Kabib here. He's just giving me nothing. [groaning] Geez, Louis, you guys had me sweating there! Is that even a sword or are you just happy to see me? [laughing] It's not even sharp. What are you gonna do? LARP me to death! LARP? What the fuck is LARP? It's an acronym. Live Action Role Play. Oh, you'll love it, it's for losers like you, - they get all dressed up... - [Gabe] You motherfucker! Uh, you little bitch! That hurt! Why you always gotta be like this, man! Why you always gotta be a dick! A dick? Wha... Why didn't he give me a dick then? Think about it. He gives all these motherfuckers penises. They're walking around slinging 'em like this or whatever they fucking do with it. It's just smooth down there for me. It's like a... it's like a doll... Like an action figure, I mean. And I'm just sitting down there watching everybody get jack rabbit fucked, booty claps, slapping that flesh, fucking tits and dicks everywhere, and I'm just sitting there watching like a fucking cuck. And I can't even jerk off! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go gorilla fuck this broad's lights out with my brand new hog. [snorts] Pig! [rock music playing] What's up, buddy? It's showtime. You ready? You fucker. [panting] It's... [yelling] [Dan] Lars, buddy, where have you been? I have been looking everywhere for you, man. I was... I was in the party and then... and then I went to the Mexican restaurant downtown and then I was at the new gelato place and you were in none of those places, man! You must not have been looking very hard, buddy, 'cause I was in all of those places. - Damn! - Oh, yeah. I must have just missed you. And then my bike's tire got a flat and I had to walk. God, I can barely stand. Yeah. I can see that. Hey, haven't you been running every day for the last three months, bud? Uh, yeah, but this, uh, was more running. Yeah, I'm sure it was lard. I mean, Lars, Lars. Hey, hey, that wasn't very nice. I'm sorry. It... it slipped out. - It just slipped out. - Wait. Are you still Dan or are you Satan yet? Why? [scoffs] Would you relax, Perv-bury Doughboy? Yes, I'm Dan. Of course I'm Dan. He possessed me for a brief moment and then I had this... this beautiful kiss with Lilly under a star lit sky. And the power of true love, it cast him from my body right back to the depths of hell where he belongs. And now, Lilly is in the shower getting ready for yours truly. - [laughs] - Really? - Yeah, really. - Dude! - Right. - Man, uh. - That's a relief, man. - Yeah. God!

Geez! [sentimental piano music playing] [Dan yelling indistinctly] Fuck God! Yeah! [Dan moaning loudly] Really sweet! - [Lilly moaning] - Boom! [ear ringing] [knocking in the distance] [ominous instrumental] Isn't this beautiful? [Dan exhales sharply] Yeah, it really is. [knocking in the distance] Wait, am I dead? Is... is this a dream? Am I dreaming? This has all been a dream, Danny boy. My dream. Come true. Okay. What if... What if I wanna wake up? That is your choice. You do have a choice. But, you know, sometimes it's easier to live in one's dream than one's, uh, reality, if you know what I mean. I'm not really sure how to feel about that. You should feel privileged, Dan. You... you helped fulfill a prophecy. Helped bring about the apocalypse. We're Pac-ky bros. [laughing] I don't... If this was your plan the whole time, I just don't understand why me. Dan, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please don't give me that bullshit, Dan. I don't wanna hear one more fucking moment of your sad sack, Dan. If I... You... you know what? If I got... You're... You got a stupid face, Dan. You got a real stupid face. Yeah. I'm so sick to death of your face. I think the world's sick of your face, Dan. Everybody sees you and you're like the fat kid on the playground. Can't explain it. They don't know why. That face is so punchable, they just wanna beat the shit out of it. Yeah. Look, if I'm gonna take... take the reins, take control of somebody, what do you think? I'm gonna go for the... the Pope? Am I gonna make it harder for myself? No, no, no, no, no, no, Danny. See, you... you're stupid, you're lazy, you're easy. You're driftwood. It's so easy to just push you in a direction. Look, I could have gone a different way. I could have totally gone a different way, but, you know, Jared Leto's schedule was chalk full of so much bullshit. So much! [sighs] [whispering] Jared Leto. - Yeah. - You know, big guy is not a big fan of him either. Mm, yeah, great universal unifier there. We all hate Jared Leto. Ice cream? [Satan] Oh, it's so fucking good. Why do you hate humanity so much? I don't hate humanity. I love you guys. I love you so much, I wanna spend the rest of eternity with you. Forever and always.

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Uh... I don't really know if I wanna wake up now, you know? [knocking getting closer] Wanna wind back the clock, right? Take it all back. Make better choices. Yeah, I understand, but unfortunately... that's even out of my jurisdiction. Yeah. Gotta live with those choices, Dan. Live with them. See, unfortunately, you made the decision that has plagued mankind since the dawn of time. You were thinking with your dick. [laughing] Deuces sucker!
