be concentrating on that girl that um uh valerie steffen why are they picking on you well first of all i don't think they believed me when i told them why i didn't meet frank that night why didn't you meet him i was driving up from san diego and the fall got so thick i had to pull over to the side of the road and sleep in the car i suppose you've been reading the papers you mean about that cruise a few years ago when your husband disappeared overboard well i'm afraid it didn't help appearances that frank chatham was there also he was escorting my sister your sister there was nothing between frank and i until long after my husband died the point is none of this ugliness is going to stop until after they find frank's murderer and frankly i don't think i can go through all that again will

you see i saw a spider what you heard me mister i saw a spider a giant spider come on rags come on a giant spider now maybe some kind of homicidal spider psycho a freak out bug man or something but really do you know how spider feeds no why should i permit me to enlighten you a spider either stuns or kills its victim and then drains off all the bodily fluids lovely spiders have fangs mark and when they attack they sink them into their victim and inject their poison now just imagine a spider large enough and those chest wounds could be caused by its fangs oh rex rex i'm out of my mind no no no that that's all right it's okay an ape size spider fine fine now tell me something what about this valerie lady what about her uh she's its keeper right that's a notion i'd be happy to accept you know mark there's uh been some pretty strange legends down through history about spiders giant spiders and uh uh myths about women who turn into these things i know please don't tell me you think this thing is valerie stefan and drag no that is unnatural just listen all right the chinese tell of an enchanting woman who appeared to travelers when they were lost and took them to a cave to rest while they slept she would transform herself into a giant spider sting them wrap them in her web and feed on them at her leisure and and there's others mark and there's some north american indians who had similar beliefs it's all in here it's quite an education what's callie say about this you kidding he says i'm out of my mind i'll tell you something rags if you really believe this thing you better start thinking about letting people know about it forget it no chance will you tell me something why did you send me out on that wild goose chase because maybe gully's right maybe i am out of my mind oh mark higley private investigator you know if i were a client i would have hung up i'm sorry but your staff was out doing other things listen you know how hot that maniac kozad has it in here well you just hang in there darling just think cool what's happening ah well lee lockridge called a little while ago she sounded pretty upset seems that conte's visit her about uh carlo's death get back to her flaps and tell her i'll drop by her house later okay all right listen one other thing i got the analysis back from my friend at usc he doesn't know what it is exactly what do you mean exactly well he says the closest that uh it comes to is all right get this you ready the venom of a black widow spider you're not laughing i know oh hi lee listen i'm sorry i didn't get back to you sooner i've been kind of busy i can't believe it about the carlo yeah i know i know oh this is quite a place you've got here thank you your own private ocean huh listen lee why don't you put something on we'll take a walk on the beach and talk okay good i'll get a swim all right oh i'm sorry i shouted it's just something i feel very strongly about i know they look kind of scary but they're really harmless we get them out here at the beach all the time they're everywhere anyway i'm sure it was much more frightening than you were i doubt that listen why don't we take out for a walk probably need some air that's a neat trick you did with that spider i'm not really i've never been afraid of them uh-huh what are you gonna do with it let him go he'll watch come on big daddy what did connie want lee he wanted to know where i was last night uh-huh what did you say to him well i told him the truth i was home you should see the way you looked at me you know lee connie may be a little rough around the edges but he's no fool i just can't figure out why he keeps coming back to you look there's something i should have told you before about my husband's disappearance what's that it wasn't in the papers but there was a shipboard investigation there was a passenger who said he saw my husband that night a dark attractive woman he said they were in each other's arms oh no wait wait a minute you're not saying that he thinks this valerie stefan was there too and anyway what's that got to do with you i don't know i don't know if that woman didn't exist they made a search of the ship and they didn't find anyone that lady is beginning to get on my nerves you found anything yet i don't know i've got a couple of things i'm running down it's been pretty rough on you hasn't it i'll live hey listen lee i've got an idea i've just about finished everything i got to do today and i could really use a few laughs why don't we have a couple of drinks some dinner and we'll forget valerie stefan and everything okay what do you say you're on okay let's go deal hi laura how are you i'm good mark this is my sister laura well how do you do laura hello nice to meet you nice to meet you say jeff wallace jeff hello it's a pleasure mr president this is mark higby the private investigator i mentioned oh it's been a long time since we were all together at this place this used to be sort of a hangout of ours a few years ago uh-huh laura let's dance not right now it's too fast i bet lisa likes to move no thank you jack come on i'm not gonna take no for an answer have fun kitties i knew lee had a sister but i thought you were twins oh well yes but fraternal not identical oh we still fit together pretty well don't we jeff i don't want that i do it's been a long time uh thank you for the evening mark i'm sorry i'm gonna cut it so sure i guess everything just kind of caught up oh that's all right i'm sorry too i'll ask you in another well whatever it was it sure happened fast on that dance floor good night jim leave me alone now why don't i believe you i swear to god i'll tell laura i doubt that hey take it easy so i'm gonna fix myself a drink where can i get you get out of here hey come on it's early i said get out of here suit yourself you know this isn't the only place in town i can get a drink i've got a client involved in this thing huh i'm telling you it's all right would you just hey gully i got a call from the lock bridges let him in thanks what's happened here it's like wallace found something waiting for him when he got home excuse me rex what was all that stuff i'll tell you what i think it is what spider silk i think we better have a talk with our friend the way it looks to me uh whatever it was tried to drag the body away when it was interrupted you know what that stuff wrapped all around the body was don't you save your breath i'm a believer what are you gonna do about it gully what am i supposed to do about it well i think you tell the people at least let them know what's going on out there hey that's a great idea really that's a great idea why don't i hold a i want to hold a press conference and tell them there's a big spider out there killing people and i'll issue all my men giant cans of rage and send them out after it that'll do to me they'll put me away someplace they'll put me on weaving so i don't hurt anybody no he'd be the lid stays on this one now if i hear one word on the street about any giant spiders only would have come all right all right but at least maybe now you'll get off lee lockwood's case get off lee lagrish's case inside of one week two fiancees or lockridge sisters had their chests ripped out forget about carlo i don't know where he fits in and throw out that poor sap of her husband who maybe fell off the boat no hick b even admitting that i don't know what the connection with the spider is i'm not going to get off lee lockwood's case in fact i'm adding assisted to it the uh mark huh what something else you gotta know what else could that be well uh this is a wallace with a gun nut uh it's a crack shot we took uh six bullets out of the wall in there so well there's six big fat slugs from a 44 magnum i had to be fired at point-blank range well there wasn't a trace of blood or flesh or bone on any of them now what i can't get over about the like rich girls is all those terrible tragedies in their lives did i show you the red hourglass on the stomach hey if you don't get rid of that thing i'm taking a walk do you understand i can cost me 12 bucks see that's how you can tell it's a girl see that and look at that look at that eight eyes a black widow has eight eyes yuck yeah now listen to this here hold it hold it just take it just take it put it down over there that's it now some northern california indians believed it was a curse of some kind transmitted down through the female line it may lie dormant for years until triggered by a certain kind of spider venom once bitten by the spider the woman periodically but only during the cycle of the full moon makes the transformation into an incredibly large spider higby i'll i'll humor you up to a point but i i just can't swallow that you know at least it explains valerie steffen higby you want to hear what i got on the lock ridges hmm yeah yeah let me hear the tragedies all right it all started when the girls were born actually before the father was paul lockridge financier and flying freak he was killed when his plane crashed in the sierras in 1947. the mother was aboard but survived she was pregnant at the time gave birth to the girls alone in the mountains it was two days before they were found by an indian guide wow anything else uh nothing until 1965 mrs lockwood decided to live in italy and she died in rome wow the details are a little foggy about that foggy what do you mean foggy well uh no cause of death was indicated and there was a closed casket service why i don't know you know everything else that's happened since then but uh nothing nothing to link either girl to any of the earlier murders and there was nothing to tie them to the spider thing either no darling there's nothing to tie them to the spider thing either mwah wait a minute what what are you looking for look higbee i don't really buy yakakamemi indian maiden legend right but if you're looking for connection try this doctors said it was almost a miracle that mrs lockridge's infant daughter survived their ordeal not only did they suffer from exposure but hospital sources said one of the babies was so severely bitten by insects that she remained comatose for almost a week which one it doesn't say what kind of insects doesn't say that either does it say where that plane crashed uh near a place called keto ridge uh it's up above sacramento i think so when are you leaving now uh ah i'm afraid the records you need were lost when the old wing burned in 58 mr higby the paper said something about an indian who found the plane crash well that was before my time but i know the lock ridges owned some vineyards and a winery out on bald knob road do you have to know if the vineyards are still there well they're abandoned now but i hear there's an old indian who used to work for them who still lives on the place much obliged to you mr summers i'd be careful if i were going out there mr higby really why is that well the old fella has been known to take a pot shot or two at hunters or fishermen who try to use the place hmm i see well i'll be very careful thank you very much so so so hello hello anybody there um hey listen if anybody's around all i want to do is talk hello i fell the spiders i sent these spiders away what actually i suspected was your acrobatic entry into their home that shook them down from the ceiling who are you my name is aspar silvado you're the indian who worked for the lockwoods that's very perceptive now let me guess what you do for a living you're a private investigator nothing to it mr higby now what are you doing here didn't you see the signs i i i i was looking for you why well i was working for one of the lockridge girls i came here to find out more about the plane crash that killed their father mr soldado you're the one who found the mother and the two babies aren't you yes well now the newspaper said one of the babies was severely bitten by insects that's right the child almost died i i know this may sound a little strange to you but i need to know what kind of insects technically spiders are not insects they're arachnids you were bitten by spiders are you sure of that yes mr soldado this is very very important could you tell me which of the babies was bitten oh i'm sorry mr higby i don't know they were day-old infants i never saw them after they were taken to the hospital we are talking of old legends aren't we yes the spider woman a woman who sometimes in moments of great stress takes the form of a giant spider and kills that's right that's exactly right that's it it's quite colorful oh well i understand you might not really believe it who said i don't believe but what i don't understand is how a sophisticated city dweller like you seems to have a good reason good reason i know one thing uh the books i've read have been rather vague about what happens to these things i mean what did they do do they die of all they hate you what the legend says they are virtually indestructible in the form of a spider nothing can kill them nothing nothing mr higby except fire ugh uh you scared me i scared you you know you almost gave me a cardiac will you stop yelling at me i'm not yelling at you i'm not your leader i am not what are you doing here anyway i didn't want to miss you i came up i fell asleep i'm sorry listen mark you're really not gonna like this i think lee lockridge is the one what do you mean lee lockridge is the one i listen when you left here no offense but uh i really didn't think you were operating with a uh full deck huh so then i got the mulling over the full moon and i whipped out the almanac i started checking out the dates against those of the earliest killings and you know something they all conformed to the cycle of the full moon from the husband on the boat right down to the murders last week yeah but all that does is just confirm the legend that's all look then i started checking out the date very closely and i realized something lee traveled and laura didn't so higly the only time the murders occurred is when lee was in town so what does that prove laura was here too all right now if laura's the culprit it would seem to me there would have been a couple of murders while lee was out of town no all right flapsy since you've got it all figured out you tell me what about valerie steffen who's she did you see the three faces of eve the what the movie the three faces of eve oh yeah yeah all right let's imagine now we have here a split personality puts on disguises and goes after her victims which brings me to my final detail tonight is the last night of the full moon hello laura it's mark higby i want to talk to you about lee why what's wrong has something happened to her no no no nothing's happened what is it then when was the last time you talked to her tonight uh-huh well tell me did she uh did she seem all right was she upset or anything she was a bit nervous she said she wanted to see me she wanted to see you what about she didn't explain she said she felt that we ought to be together tonight and she was driving up here to woodcliff laura i want to ask you something now this happens to be very important how much do you know about your father's death in that plane crash only what our mother told us why well the report said that before help came one of the babies now it was either you or lee was severely bitten by insects spiders do you know which one of you it was laura do you know which one yes well who was it you were me it was lee lee tell me something laura when's the last time you talked to her about an hour ago i want you to get out of there right away now what are you talking about are you saying i should be afraid of my own sister just get out of there i want you to check into a motel anything do anything but get out of there before lee arrives why but please don't ask me to explain just do it it's just
