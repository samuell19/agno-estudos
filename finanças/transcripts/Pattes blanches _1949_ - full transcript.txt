- What's wrong? - Nothing, it's overheating. We're almost there. The village is over yonder. At the bend, you'll see the lighthouse, the inn is just opposite. It's pretty country. And what's that, over there? Where? Over there, alone on the moor? It?s the manor. It looks nice. Who lives there? A madman lives there alone. I'll tell you later. "Better to Die Than to Falter" Go on, Caesar. White Shanks! White Shanks! White Shanks! White Shanks! Stop it, you brats! Look! Here's Jock with his big bankroll. Mimi! Mimi, come give me a hand. Come on, Odette. - Hello, guys! - Hello, Jock. This is my niece, the daughter of my aunt from Dinan. She's living here now. Mimi, you heard me? Go fix up the beautiful bedroom. Come on, Odette. The apartments are upstairs. Hear that? "The apartments". Shit. Already panting, aren't you, Maurice? This should get rid of the damp. The room hasn't been aired out since... Open the window, dammit. Can't you see the smoke? White Shanks! White Shanks! White Shanks! I'll be right back. It's the lord of the manor, the one I told you about. When he comes down, the kids run after him, he isn't liked around here. - Why? - No one knows. So... like your room? Yes, whitewash is depressing. I'll have it covered up with flowered wallpaper. and I'll buy anything you want. How about that, bitch? Eleven pounds. I'll give you 680. What do you mean, 680? Fish prices are down again? - They are. - Who says so? I do. His inheritance made that swine even meaner than he was. - The more you have, the more you want. - He owns everything. You go fishing, you sell your fish at the price he chooses. At night, you're bored stiff, so you drink at his place, and give him the money back. - Did you iron the dress? - Yes. Is she awake? I don't know. I told you to bring her coffee when she wakes up. You must serve her like a lady. Come on, prepare a tray. A tray? Yes, a tray with a doily like they do in hotels. - We don't have any here. - Well... find one. And put on a clean apron. You've got to serve her like a lady, got it? Mimi! Some jam, add some jam like in the hotels. Jam with her coffee? Yes. What are you up to? As you can see, I'm having a little calva. - At this hour? - Why not? You don't usually come in so early. You're concerned about my stomach now? Another calva, boss. Go ahead and serve him, Mimi. Why shouldn't I drink calva in the morning if I feel like it. Huh? Beautiful? Your coffee's awful. It'll be good tomorrow, honey, I swear. - And this bread? - That's what we eat around here, but the baker will make good one for you. Maybe even some croissants, like in the city. In a hole like this, the baker won't even know how. Don't worry, he'll learn, honey, I swear. It's nice watching you eat. Your lips are all buttery. - No. - Why not? You didn't say no last night. - You smell like fish. - I washed up before I came up. - You smell like washed fish, it's worse. - You numbskull. Go on! You wrinkle your little nose and say I smell of fish. You know what my fish is? Give it here. - You'll knock it over! - Give it here, I said. You wanted that pendant on a chain with the real diamonds, didn't you? Couldn't take your eyes off it in the shop on St Brieuc's Main Street. Well if we can hang that round your neck, just because you looked at it, it's because I smell of fish. And the ring with the big stone, you'll get that in two days. But it'll be made of fish too. Everything you wear, the dresses, the silk night gowns on your little tummy, they're all made of fish. From fine, unsmelling fish. You still want them? And me with them? No. I... I'll wash up. I'll wash, I'll scrub my hide off. And I won't smell any more. Come on in. Now you know you'll only have one bed to make. Look at that dummy. Bring over the dress. Like it? It was in the box I didn't want you to see. Put it on the bed, you. Pure silk. So smooth on the skin. - I'll help you put it on. - No, not you. You'd wrinkle it with your big mitts. Mimi will help me. Go away! Are your hands clean? Can't I stay and watch? I'll be quiet. No! Call me, Mimi, once she's got it on. Drinks are on me, guys. I'm happy as can be this morning. Another calva, boss. You're still here? Did she sleep well? Who? Your niece. Sometimes the sea air, on the first night... Get out. - A calva. - Get out! - One can't drink here? - Not you. Get out. Not me. I know the law, Jock. To keep your permit, you must serve your customers, all your customers. You know that. I behave well. I keep quiet, I've got money. Give me another calva. You mutt! I feel good at your place. Such beautiful silk, like a lady. I've earned it. I'm not his niece, you know. I was working at his aunt's place, the one who died. I met him at the funeral. He took a liking to me. He's a swell guy. And I'd had enough of pricking my fingertips. Ten years of pricking. Do you think it takes ten years for a finger to get soft again? Why are you looking at me like that? You're beautiful. You smell too good for him. I smell good from the perfume he bought me, dummy! Before, with my little soldier from St Brieuc, I didn't smell anything at all. I was happy but I didn't smell anything. What did you tell him? My Margis? That I was going back home. And you? Oh, well, you know... he wasn't the first. That's the hassle with garrison towns: the soldiers never stay long enough to fall in love. He loved you truly? You bet. He wanted to desert to go away with me. - If someone ever... - You seem like a sweet girl. I wonder how Jock didn't even feel these last night under his butt. As you can see, these are letters. I don't want to throw them out right away. Hide them in your room. They're love letters? You can read them, you know. Just don't dream about them. Another calva. - No. - I've still got money, you've got to. No! I know the law too. You're drunk and I can throw you out. - Me, drunk? - Yeah! I've waited long enough. The law is on my side. You're witnesses, right? I'm throwing him out now that he's drunk. I won't move. I'll stay here until she comes down. Don't start anything or you'll never set foot in here again. I know the law too, you mutt! How dare you insult me? You've got no right. Maybe you're as much of a mutt as I am. - Do you really know who your father is? - We know yours, son of a whore. Beat it! Idiot! Idiots! You think the old man didn't have your mothers, too? Just like mine? We're all of us mutts of the manor. Except maybe those whose mothers were really ugly. Even then, she really would've had to be as ugly as sin. The old count was not very choosy. She'd have to be as ugly as yours. Enough! Beat it! Why don't you want me to see her if she's not your little woman? I ain't gonna budge, get it? I ain't gonna budge 'til she comes out. I'm at home in the street. Maurice, I won't hit you, you're too weak and too scared. Beat it or I'll knock you down. Leave me alone. I'm sick, aren't you ashamed? Leave me be or I'll cough and I'll tell the doctor you made me cough. Scum. Well, well... Somebody's on the balcony. Excuse me, miss. Your uncle and I, we were talking. We didn't agree. He has no education and that annoys him because I do. That's all there is to it. Get back inside. He's drunk. - What's going on here? - Oh, little brother, good to see you. They won't let me in. Jock's brought a beautiful girl and he's hiding her. Look! Look how beautiful she is, little brother. - You like them so much. - He's drunk, M. de K?riadec. - Go back to your mother's - When I want to. No, if I want you to. Come on, go away. White Shanks! Get yourself inside! White Shanks! White Shanks! Thank you. Those kids are unbearable. I dare not chase them. There might be an accident. I'm very violent. You are very kind. Thank you. I'd noticed recently that someone had been scaring them off with a towel. Someone I'd never seen before. It was you. Yes, sir. I'll feel less frightened now. You're so small and yet you frighten off these fearsome monsters. Oh... it's my rag. You know, don't you, that they call me "White Shanks". Yes, sir. My spats have been my ruin around here. Strange I'd never seen you. How long have you been here? Only a few months. I'm from Plenahen. I was hired at the "Caf? du Port" as a servant. You looked funny going after them, flapping your rag like that. Oh, they're just kids. But I could go up against adults too. I must ask you something. If I'm mistaken, forgive me. For three months, someone has been writing very nice little letters to me saying that not everyone hates me around here. You wouldn't perchance be the one who wrote those letters? It was me, sir. I owe you many thanks tonight, Miss. Don't make fun of me or call me Miss. I'm not making fun of you. It means a lot to me to know that now I have a friend here. I'm so alone here. When you have time, on a Sunday, after your work, come and see me at the manor. I rarely go out. - You can meet Caesar. - Who's Caesar? My horse. Yes, I lied to you. I do have another friend. I can go no further, Monsieur. You're expected? Yes, I'm expected. See you soon then, perhaps. Perhaps. Stop smoking, Maurice. Get up. No. - It's late. - I don't care. - I've already been working for three hours. - I'm sick. That's why I came back. Didn't the doctor say I was coughing? You've been here for six months. You don't cough any more. I stifle it. She's beautiful. She smells good. She was at the window. I could smell her from the road. Stop thinking about that girl, she's not for you. He says she's his niece. But she isn't, I know it. She's for Big Jock who stinks of fish, that little bird. - Get up! - No! I'll never have a woman, never! Don't be silly! You get all the girls you want, lecher! Peasant girls, laid in fields between cow-patties. That's good enough for me. But one who smells good, clean, in fine linen, she's for Big Jock, because he can pay. Ain't I better than that fat swine? I'm better than all of them. The priests at the seminary told me so before they kicked me out. They said I showed great promise. - If you had tried... - I don't want to. No, show poor Maurice the door, with a kick in the ass because he's the maid's son. And that one in his manor, with his white leggings and the cash and the rest, because he came from the right place. He beat me. He beat me again, mum, White Shanks. That brute! A boy nursed at my breast. - You should have poisoned him. - He'll end up like his father, a millstone round his neck, in the harbor and they'll call it an accident. How can he live alone in this big house? That boy's always been a bit odd. He's his father. When he came in, I thought I was seeing his father. Same jaw and same hands. L?on's life and death were one long scandal. His son's never occasioned any talk. He did have that incident in Algeria. He had a fine career in the Army ahead of him. Why did he leave the Army? He's never wanted to talk about it. I heard that there was a fight and a man died. Probably over a woman. Well, gentlemen! Have you been able to convince our hermit? Dear aunts, cousin, these gentlemen told me of your generous offer. But I can't accept them. I won't sell K?riadec. But you can't afford to live there any more, my dear. I'll live there as I live. K?riadec may fall on my head but I won't sell. Bazin says selling some pricy furniture could solve the problem. I will sell nothing. But thank you for your concern. You're a strange one, Julien. Bazin, you have rum in your tea, don't you? Not you, Julien? No thank you, dear aunt. I don't touch alcohol any more. I am delighted I had the opportunity to meet you. As am I, Judge. For some time, I've wanted to talk to you about something delicate concerning your half-brother. A little farm-girl. consenting, certainly... Unfortunately she was under age and the father knowing that you're related to the culprit believes he can get some money. - How much? - 20, 30 thousand. And I hope he'll withdraw the complaint. My dear K?riadec, that you should pay for the follies of your charming and terrible father is one thing, but for those of this sorry individual... Ah, it's you. Come in! I've come to tell you that I won't be coming on Sunday. - Why? Come in. - No, I'd rather stay in the dark. I've come to tell you I won't come tomorrow because I'm a hunchback. What are you talking about? I find you very nice as you are! Come on in. Does my mess frighten you? - So this is where you live all alone? - Yes. It really is a mess. I don't mind frying eggs but I don't scour pans. Well, you might put things away. Don't you ever wash the dishes? Well, I wash them. But not every day. - And this is where you'll eat? - Of course. But first, I'm going to attend to Caesar who's waiting. Honor to whom honor is due. Come and see him. Come here, Caesar, come. I beg your pardon, but it was such a mess. I also made a soup with what I could find. - Just wait for it to come to a boil. - Thank you, Mimi. I have something to give you, too. Come. Oh, Lord. Here! Do you like this one? It's yours. It's so beautiful. Mimi. Listen. Where did you get that dress? It was given to me. Someone gave you a dress? Who gave it to you? My sweetheart. You've got a sweetheart? You? You've got a sweetheart! Let's see. Don't come near me. Don't you dare touch me. A sweetheart! Well, show me. It's a ball gown. He'll take you to the ball, this sweetheart of yours? And it's even low-cut. But you have nothing to fill it out with, my poor girl. Come and see, Jock. You're not the only one handing out dresses. Look at little Mimi. She's got a lover. He's given her a dress more beautiful than anything you'll ever give me. How about that! Stay away! Touch my dress and I'll kill you. - Your turn, Jock! - In a minute. - Where are you going, Mimi? - To Vespers. Pray to God for me, I need it. Where are you going? For a walk. Am I allowed? Can I come along? No. - It's Sunday. - Exactly. And I need a rest. But, Odette... Jock? - Jock! - What? - Here! - Sorry. It's Sunday today, it's a fine day. Come bowling with us. - I don't know how to. - Well, I'll teach you. Come on! Play this or we'll play a different game. Hello, Mimi. - Well, I came after all. - I'm glad. Come see Caesar. - Oh, he is beautiful. - Yes. Beautiful. And good. Besides, he doesn't speak so we always get along. If you'd like me to come sometimes, I wouldn't bother you any more than Caesar. I know. Would it bother you if I cleaned your place up? You put me to shame last night, I washed the dishes. Oh... I'm ugly and hunchbacked but... but a young and fine gentleman like you can't always live alone. Excuse me, Mimi. Caesar. Excuse me. Are you looking for someone? No, I came with Mimi. It's awfully hot today. Yes. Come, Caesar. Come. Introduce us, Mimi. It's more seemly. This is Mr. Jock's niece. It really is terribly hot today. If you want something to drink, I have chilled wine in the kitchen. - You don't drink? - Almost never. I saw the beautiful gown you gave Mimi. - Do you have many more? - Yes. Having grandmothers is nice. If I had lots of dresses like that, I'd strip naked and put them on, one after the other. Don't you find it hot? Do you know what we should do? That's better. Walking barefoot may not be very polite but the tiles feel so cool. It feels like water. These old-time kitchens are wonderful. Can we see the rest of the manor? It's all shut up. Ouch! Do you break many glasses when you're alone? I've cut my foot. I break many things. I'm very clumsy. Oh, the cut's deep. It feels like there's glass stuck inside. Will you look, Mimi? There. Do you see any glass? No, I don't but... I've got iodine in my room. I'll go and get it for you. This is your bedroom? Yes. You haven't found anything better in this big manor? This is what you sleep on? It's my army cot. I've kept it. Here! Silly of me but... I'm afraid it'll sting. Couldn't you... I don't like it when it hurts. Oh, How pretty that is. A souvenir from Algeria? - Give it to me! - Why? I won't harm it. - Give it to me at once. - A souvenir from a woman, right? - Let go of me. You're hurting me. - Give it to me at once. Your hands are so hard! Look! Your fingers made marks on my arm. This heat's just dreadful. Have you seen his room, Mimi? He sleeps on a bed that's this wide. What have you come here for? To live. My aunt died. No. You're Jock's mistress. - Who told you? - He did. - You're his friend? - I'm nobody's friend. I met him on the train, he told me about you. He wanted to buy my piano to amuse you. So what? You're ashamed to have received Jock's mistress in your kitchen? It's funny, you seem scared of me. Miss, I live like a savage here. I do my own washing and cooking. I've got no money. I've given up all of the manners of my class. Yet, there's one I'll always keep: being polite. Excuse me, I was grooming my horse when you arrived, I must finish. Well, well... he's not very jolly, this sweetheart of yours. What a grumpy bear. He's a bore. If he won't show me around, I'll visit on my own. I forbid you. You have no right. Watch me, honey, I'm about to take the right. Odette! Odette! Where is she? She's gone up to visit the manor. All by herself. I don't like such insolence. Please forgive me, I didn't know she would follow me. - I won't come again. - Why? How beautiful it is here. Why didn't you want me to see it? Get up! That's my mother's bed. I won't soil it. Open the shutters, if you're afraid. No. I'm just a poor girl from Saint Brieuc and the mistress, it's true, of the village innkeeper. Yet I also have my manners that I try to keep: To have the courage to do what I want. Mimi! Mimi, god damn it! What's that bitch up to? She can't come help me, huh? More. Further. There. A bit more that way. It's better that way, isn't it? If you say so... Who gave you such ideas? And I want curtains for the windows, understand? Silk ones. If you want them, you'll have them. I only want you to like it here. And, I don't know... a rug so I can go barefoot when I get up. Only peasants don't have rugs. - Really? - And some pictures. Real ones. Not your wife and your grandfather. - But they've always been here. - That's precisely it. They've been here too long, they have to go - if you want me to stay. - My wife, I can understand, - but my grandpa's done you no harm. - Him, too. He watches me undress every night. He was quite a randy devil in his time. But it's only a portrait. Well, since you don't like him, he'll join the others in the attic. Poor old guy. And I want some furniture. There's nothing in here. Armchairs, flowers, vases. Do you know what I want? A bathroom! A bathroom? But we've got the sea here. The sea! The sea! Such a peasant. What I want, what I really want is to be a real lady. Honey, I don't like it when you want something and don't have it. You'll be a real lady, I swear. And you'll get a bathroom. - Eight hundred. - No. Nine hundred. The folks from the manor gave it to the old lady when they had their bathroom made. She does her washing in it. She can do it elsewhere. Come on, one thousand, last offer. All right. I'll get the wheelbarrow. That will do, stop here. Here's your thousand francs. - No. - What? - I only sell it if I carry it up. - You want me to hit you? No, but I sold the tub, so I deliver it. - I'm too kind. - Scram, mutt. No. It's too heavy for you. Stop! - No, up to the room. - You fool, what did you expect? That she undressed, expecting you? Watch out! There we are. At your service, madam. Here's your one thousand. Now beat it. No, Jock. There's no need. I've had my pay. Mimi! Mimi! We need you. Quickly, dammit! Don't let her catch cold. - You don't feel sick, do you? - Of course not, silly! - Why are you washing in the afternoon? - I'm not allowed to? - You're up to something. - My shirt, the one with a hole, mend it. - You didn't want me to. - I do now. At once. Shaving on a Thursday? It's bad luck on Thursday? You're up to no good. Listen. The girl is mine if I want her. - I know it. - Beware of Jock. - He's richer and stronger than you. - Yes. But he's in St Brieuc. Listen. The girl, she goes walking every night on the moor, beyond the Calvary. Behind each curtain, there's an old crone spying on her. Talk to her and Jock will know tomorrow morning. But if she talks to you, the gossips won't give a damn. What if she talks to you and you lead her somewhere, without her knowing, where I'll tell you to. - Is she pregnant? - Yes. It won't be long now. - You're picking grass for her? - No, these are medicinal herbs. You see these herbs? You grind them with beef fat into a salve. You can add perfume, but, perfume or not, your wrinkles are gone. - I don't need that. - But you will. Soon. In my day, I was beautiful too. If I told you my lover's name, you'd be surprised. You want the herb to make men fall in love? I know it too. No need! The men come all by themselves. Yet one day, you'll want the one you love to think only of you. There isn't much of your herb about. There isn't much love about either. Are you new here? You're at Jock's? Pretty girls like you like the pleasure but not the... - Why tell me this? - No reason, but you should know it. You see that herb? If I wanted my goat not to have her kid, I'd get a lot of it and give it to her. - Ever tried it? - On my goat, no way! And this herb is as rare as the other one? Not as rare. Gather some, child, gather some. You never know. Hey, old woman. Is this the right one? Old woman! Where are you? Old woman? Where are you, old woman? Are you lost? No. Well, a bit. I followed an old woman who was gathering herbs. And as I'm not from around here... - Is the village far away? - Not very far. - Do you want me to walk you back? - I'd like that. Why didn't you take the money for the tub? - I liked giving it to you. - But you don't know me. I do, a little. Why did you tell Jock: "I've had my pay. " Because I'd seen you lying on your bed, naked. Wait a minute! - I wasn't naked. - To me, you were. You're a strange boy. That's what they all think around here. They don't like me. Because I'm nothing like them. - Neither are you. - Me? You're nothing like the others. Come on, pay up! - Bye, Jock. - Bye. It's odd that he's not here tonight. - Who? - Maurice. - He may be tired. - His kind never gets tired. He's not a man. He finally got scared. - Maybe. Good night. - Bye. See you tomorrow. I don't like him coming around here, but it feels strange when he doesn't. Go ahead and close up. Good night, Mimi. Good night. - Come on, open up, Odette. - No. - Why not? - I want to sleep alone. But I said I was sorry. - I waited three nights. - It's not that easy. I had to cause a row with him, so I could sleep alone. I had to wait until he was asleep. If he wakes up, he'll kill me. I'm here. Come over here. It's so soft. I've gathered lots of herbs. Your mother's herbs, to make people fall in love? No, just some rabbit fodder, but it's nice just the same. Yes, it's nice. My darling. It's never happened. What hasn't happened? Love. With Jock, okay, but what about St Brieuc, before? The same. I didn't know how uncomplicated it could be. You smell good. Don't move too much. It feels so nice as we are. It's silly. I'm happy like when I was a kid. Yet you're a devil. I don't even know you. That's because you're a devil too. Stupid girl. They hate me in the village because I'm not like them. My mother has been a maid at the manor for a long time. She had me there with the count, the one before. They hate me for that. The old Count liked me. He sent me to the seminary. They wanted me to be a priest. But the priests kicked me out. I came back to the manor. White Shanks, once his father died, he threw me out. I'm used to being kicked out. But I'll get them some day. All of them. So you're his brother. Whose? - White Shanks. - Yes. 'Til death do us part, as they say. 'Til death, in fact. One day, he'll pay for all he's done to me. Maurice, do you love me? I don't like words. Words mean nothing. You know I'm your woman? There's no mistaking that after last night. You feel how, before, the others didn't count. It's nothing, you know, for a girl to say yes. It's like giving nothing. You understand? Don't worry. I know you were no holy virgin. But I want to tell you everything. I'll have no peace until I've told you everything. Let it go. We've got time. This will give us something to talk about. No, I must tell you about him. I'll feel I've come clean then. About whom? Sunday, I went to the manor. I was bored, you know what it's like. I was alone. I didn't know. It was so strange to see him, so pale, watching me. I didn't know you, Maurice. I didn't know you. Slut! Slut! Bitch! Bitch! I was there only once. I never went back. I didn't have to tell you. I won't see him again, I swear. Oh, but you will. Yes. You will see him again. Maurice. All right, stop bawling. Let's not talk about this any more. It's daybreak. Hurry up. I'll expect you tomorrow night. Aren't you going to kiss me? Of course, I'm going to kiss you! Now, go home! Go home, I said. Go! Why do you want me to do this? - Won't you get hurt? - It'll bring pleasure. And it will hurt too, but he'll pay for that. But I'm yours? - I belong to you, don't I? - You understand nothing. Get on with it. Oh, you've come back. You are here. You're beautiful. I'll never know why you've come back or what's going on in this head. You surely don't love me but here you are. And even later, when you've left, some of your perfume will linger on this bed. And on my hands. If I want, I can reach out my hand and touch you again. I'm not alone any more. It's strange, you know, always being alone. That's why I sleep on my cot. Sometimes, I've come up here. And I've stood here staring at this big, empty bed. Yes, it's true. It's true. This time, somebody's here. You're hurting me. Sorry. - I must go. - No. Stay a while. Press your body onto this bed, so that an impression of you will remain after you've left. Does my talking bother you? - No. - Don't listen, I've made it a habit to talk to myself. By the way... I would have sent it to you if you hadn't come back, even though I swore that no one would ever touch it again. It's good too to be a coward. White Shanks, huh? Mother. They used you, too. For pleasure and in the kitchen. All the hard chores. No time to finish the washing, or to dry your chapped hands, you had to get in his bed at the same wages. You've grown old now, no longer of any use. So they sent you back to your hole to die. We'll be avenged. We'll be avenged, both of us, old girl. On his knees, he'll come begging to me. Just as I did when he threw me out. Be careful, Maurice. No, I'm the stronger one now. I know my little brother. I was a little one with him, back then, in the manor. He's just like the old swine who fathered both of us. He is like me. He can try to rein himself in, now that he's had a taste of it, he'll go straight to the end. Straight to the end, hear me? And at the end, he'll find my surprise. What time is it? Seven o'clock. Stop thinking, you're worrying yourself sick. She's gone back. It's done now. Everything is settled. Under control! Just like marionettes! Mimi! - That's really something! - Good night. - What are you telling her? - Oh, it's terrible. Don't shake it. Monsieur de K?riadec. - Good evening, M. de K?riadec. - Good evening. What can I do for you? Yes, I was passing by and... And as I was passing by I said to myself I'm finally ready to sell you the piano. No! You could say I'm overjoyed! Why don't you come in, sir. Please do, you can't stay in the doorway. Please. I don't want to disturb you. I knew that my decision would make you happy. Yes, but for me the piano... It'll make Odette happy. Did you hear? Well, thank M. de Keriadec! He's going to sell me his piano. Very kind of you, sir. Thank you. Look at these hands. Like I said... They smell so good, unblemished... A real lady! She's pretty inside and out, huh? Indeed. Behave yourself. Oh well... I'm a bit tipsy. M. de K?riadec understands. We're gonna get married, the two of us. The notice has just been posted. That's what accounts for our little party here. We're celebrating. My congratulations. I'm terribly sorry for intruding... I really ought to head back. I only came to tell you about the... Ladies, gentlemen. No, no, M. de K?riadec. A sale calls for a drink! You must have a drink with me. Traditions must be respected. - But, of course, you know that. - I never drink. Oh, a little white wine is as harmless as cider. Cheers, M. de K?riadec. M. de K?riadec, if you'll allow me, it would not only please me but do me a great honor... We've got a simple but honest party going on here. Do me the honor of joining us instead of going back alone to your manor. Someone else would be pleased too. Ain't that right, you? Come on! Tell M. de K?riadec how glad you'll be if he joins us. Oh, yes, I'd be very glad. I really like M. de K?riadec. Come on, be a sport. Your dad had his faults but he never said no to a lady. Well, I... Thank you, I'll stay. Oh! That's so nice! That's so nice of you, M. de K?riadec. If all the nobles were as unpretentious as you are I'd vote for the right. Wouldn't you? I'm going to close up so we won't be disturbed. Like your father, M. de K?riadec, Let me tell you, I knew him. I sold him some horses. He was a real connoisseur. Your glass, M. de K?riadec. Oh, no. Thank you, no. No. Really, I assure you. I very rarely drink and... - I've already had too much. - Do it for me. Go ahead! The little lady's begging you. I was at a wedding once with your father. He never said no, I assure you. Your father liked his booze. Oh, M. de K?riadec. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Lots of things were said about him, he was a real character. I had that girl working on my farm. Her parents had entrusted her to me. At just 15. Do you know who I found on her one day going into the stable? Your dad, M. de K?riadec, his bare ass in the air. Enough with that. Let's talk of something else. Why would we? It's dark. I pretend I don't recognize him. I get my whip. A sound blow to his ass. But he said nothing. He took off like a jackrabbit. But when we next met at the cattle market that didn't prevent us from shaking hands as usual. To old M. de K?riadec. To M. de K?riadec. Hey, Mimi! Come on. This time, you'll have a drink with us. No! I'm not thirsty! What's got into her? M. de K?riadec! What in the world? We were only joking. Leave him alone. Can't you see he's sick? So little brother? You're in trouble? See where women will lead you? See? Yes. I almost died of shame. One never dies of shame, Mimi. That's just an expression. One doesn't even die of love. Actually, very few things are deadly. I wouldn't know. I've always been a servant. I've always been ordered about, beaten and given the dirty work. I have no need of honor. But you do. I need her. I'd do anything to have her. Good morning, Sir. If you'll follow me. I'll show you around. The bed, monsieur. A Venetian bed. It has never left my family. Yes. It's a rather nice piece. - Has it been restored? - No. It needs restoration. It's much more serious. You have no idea how hard it is to sell such a piece. You might think it's worth a fortune but the trouble is that no one's willing to pay a fortune. The chest of drawers, maybe. But it needs repairs. Extensive repairs. Do you want an offer for each item? However you wish. I'm selling everything. I have just one condition: I want the money in two days. Well... let's say 500,000. You can see I'm a generous man. For everything? But the crucifix, sir, is very old. Right. But bronze is 300 a kilo. Five hundred. Here comes the bride! The bridegroom! The bridegroom! - "Le temps des cerises"! - No. Love, love. "Love, love", yes The day after, I met Suzie I told her: "If you come with me, I'll buy you a lovely sleeveless blouse. I'll shell out the salary I'd saved for a house. I bought her silken lingerie I did all I could for my Sue But without a goodbye she left me So here's my sorrow in a song for you. And now, you know what we're gonna do? Dance a quadrille! First figure: the salute. - Go on, have a drink. - That was fun. - Hey kid. - No, no, sir! Don't hurt me... Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. You're going to take this in to the bride. The bride at the inn. Don't let anyone see you. And that's for you. You come back and tell me if you gave it to her. Off you go, boy, go. Are you happy? Happier than I ever was. Even happier than the day I first saw you. I'm glad to see you happy. It sure would be nice to be your wife, to live the quiet life. But you are my wife. Haven't you understood anything since this morning? That's right, I'm your wife. You know what? The fish, I can hardly smell it at all. - Jock! - Yes, what's wrong? Tonight she'll be yours, it's signed and sealed. It can't be undone. You lucky devil! But I'll have a dance. Yes, I lend her to you, you drunk. But don't squash her feet! What can't we do when we're as happy as this? Come on, drink. Reading a love letter on your wedding night? - What love letter? - Stop playing stupid. He sent you a letter, I saw him. Show me. Come on, show me! Maurice. He's done for! White Shanks is hooked. He's sold everything. Soon, he'll steal. He'll steal like me. You'll go to him right away. But I... I can't... They're all drunk or dancing. You can say you were resting. No, Maurice, not tonight. I don't want to, I've had enough. I want some peace. I can't take it any more, from any of you. You're all the same. You want peace. Do I have any peace? Me? Listen, I'll ask him for money. I'll give it to you so you can go away for a while. - You can come back later. - It's not money that I want. Go to him right now. I'll follow. No, Maurice, not tonight. Right now, God damn you! Oh, you've come? I've got some money, I've sold everything. - We shall leave tonight. - No! Why? Because I don't love you, because I've never loved you. I know that. But I've got more money than he has now. We'll go to Nice. I don't want your money. I've had enough of you, too. Enough of all of you, ever since I was a child, grabbing me, touching me... I want a little peace. Why have you come then? Because he forced me. What are you talking about? Who forced you? Maurice. Maurice? You know Maurice? He is my lover. I am your lover. You, my lover? If it was up to me, do you think I'd have a lover like you? No, but you haven't seen yourself. Look at yourself. White Shanks. Sorry, little brother. It took me a while but here I am. What are you doing with the inn-keeper's wife on her wedding night? It's your turn to answer now. On your knees. On your knees like me the day when you kicked me out. Say "I'm sorry", immediately! "I won't do it again". Remember? All of the words I had to say, you're going to recite them. That's why I put her in your bed. Where's the bride? - We've lost your wife. - Somebody's playing a joke. - She's nowhere to be found. - She must be upstairs. Odette? Odette? Say, Marguerite... Where's Maurice? Has anyone seen Maurice? - I saw him in the backyard. - The backyard... - Yes, he was talking to her. - In the back? He wasn't invited, was he? God damn it! I don't know. I... I was drunk, I was crazy with rage. I don't understand. You don't deny making threats? But I... I didn't kill anyone. I didn't fire a shot. I couldn't find anybody. Your shotgun was found. A shot has been fired. It's empty. I lost my footing when I was running. I fell and the gun went off by itself but... I didn't shoot, I swear. If I'd found her, I'd have shot her. But I didn't find her. They're very troubling, these village cases. You have no ideas, M. de K?riadec? No, I haven't the slightest idea about anything or anyone. This isn't an interrogation. No, I stopped by the inn and I didn't want to leave without bidding you good day. - Goodbye, M. de K?riadec. - Goodbye, sir. Judge! You know me? Who told you that I'm the judge? I heard you and the gendarmes speaking before you came here. I wanted to tell you that I lied to them. I'd rather tell you the whole story now. We cannot stay here. Get in. Already? Leave us. I'm glad to see you, M. de K?riadec. Sir, I understand the servant girl from the inn has been arrested. It's a spectacular turn of events. She has made a full confession. She was jealous of her mistress. Could she have hoped, against all likelihood, to marry the boss? The fact remains, she threw her off the cliff. They're strange... but common enough, such mortal hatreds among the disabled. Sit down, please. I don't know what has compelled this girl to denounce herself but I believe it is my duty to tell you that everything that she has declared is a pure fantasy. Interesting indeed. But may I know how you've come to such a conclusion? Odette K?roual didn't drown. - But her body was cast up by the sea. - She was killed before. To tell you the truth, M. de K?riadec, that's my opinion too. But since her body showed no visible marks and still awaiting the coroner's report that I haven't received yet, I'm astonished that you should be so certain. What has led you to your conclusion? I come from an old seafaring family, as you do, I believe, sir. I saw the body on the beach this morning. You may not have seen it. The teeth were clenched. She hadn't swallowed a single drop of water. Only simpletons like your coppers can make such a mistake. Don't scoff at my coppers, M. de K?riadec. They may be stupid, but... they're persistent and methodical. I received this morning a report that I haven't shown yet to anyone else. It seems to confirm your theory and mine. A man hung himself last night in a house of ill repute in town. You don't ask who it was? He had no papers but a "boarder" identified him as Jock Le Guen, a former customer. This act of desperation seems to prove his crime. If the coroner's report excludes drowning, it means that your young prot?g?e lied to us. That servant girl is not my prot?g?e. I can promise I'll act fast anyway. If I receive the coroner's report this afternoon, I can assure you she won't spend another night in jail. Thank you, sir. M. de K?riadec, I liked your father a lot. What I always respected about him, though he wasn't always respectable, was the grace with which he, no matter what, took full responsibility for his actions. Ah, it's you. They set you free tonight? Yes. I'm glad you've come back. It's over now. They let you go. Yes. - How handsome you are! - Yes. Yes, tonight, for the first time in a long while, I thought I had to make myself handsome. Mimi... You should go back. Your manor is so beautiful! You shouldn't have lived downstairs. Yes. It was a very beautiful manor. And I've never seen it all. Come. Watch the straw. This one here was a K?riadec for whom life must have been very simple, resting his two hands on his broadsword. He was tall and strong like you. - Did he live here? - No. Richelieu had the old castle burnt because his grandson had rebelled against his king. Why did he rebel? The K?riadecs rendered their own justice themselves and didn't like the King of France to meddle in their Breton affairs. Come. And this, this was the Grand Stateroom where they would dance. - In beautiful gowns like the one you gave me? - Yes. The men in their brocade uniforms, the women in their silk gowns amid a thousand torches. This is where they would dance until their heads were chopped off. I?ve always wanted to dance. Ever since I was a child. But I've never let anyone hold me in his arms. Mimi? It's nothing. Excuse me. I felt weak. I refused to eat in jail. It's been two days. Why did you tell the judge that it was you who killed her? I had wanted to do it so many times. It could have been me. But it wasn't you, Mimi. I'm poor, I'm ugly, I'm a hunchback. So I felt it would be better if I was the one in jail. Thank you. Why? But you know that I thank you with all my strength. I had led quite a life of adventure before shutting myself up in here. Everyone believed I was happy. But I had never been loved. It's strange to be happy. It's frightening. Now it's time for you to go. - Why? - You must. What for? To go back to cleaning for other people forever and ever... until at last I grow old and die? Why not die tonight, with you? I'm tired. I'll just fall asleep on that sweet-smelling straw and you won't wake me up. It's that simple. Acceptance? Did you ever think about that? "Better to Die Than to Falter" I'm coming with you. I've written to my attorney that you're to keep the manor. You'll take good care of Caesar. Yes, I'll take good care of Caesar. Even if it's twenty years, I'll wait for you. Go, Caesar.
