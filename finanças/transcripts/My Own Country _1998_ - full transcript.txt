OH, ME, TOO. ME, TOO. MOM? SO WHAT IS OUR CD4 COUNT, DOC? LANGDON'S 500. YOURS, I'M AFRAID, IS ONLY 30. HEY, WHAT THE HELL, HUH? ( telephone rings ) SAY, DOC, WILL YOU HAVE A COFFEE WITH ME? NOW? FORGET IT. SORRY I ASKED. NO, NO. OF COURSE I WILL. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? ( both laughing ) SEE, DOC, I GOT NO REGRETS, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, I HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT MYSELF.

I MEAN, WE FUCKED LIKE CRAZY. AND NOW, HERE WE ARE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A PUNISHMENT FROM GOD OR ANY OF THAT CRAP. I DO AGREE IT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF A CERTAIN LIFESTYLE. BUT IF I WAS TO BE REBORN, I'D WANNA COME BACK GAY. I MEAN, NO INSULT TO YOU, DOC, BUT MOST STRAIGHT MEN ARE BEER-GUZZLIN' SLOTHS, AT LEAST FROM AROUND HERE. WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP? OH, THE USUAL. I HAD TO HIDE, PRETEND I WAS STRAIGHT. PRETEND TO LAUGH WHEN SOMEBODY TOLD A FAGGOT JOKE. WHEN I GOT TO NEW YORK, WE STARTED A GROUP CALLED THE GAY LIBERATION FRONT. ALL OF US WERE YOUNG, FULL OF REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT. I MEAN, WE WERE OUT THERE IN YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME. SO WHAT BROUGHT YOU BACK TO TENNESSEE? I MISSED LANGDON SOMETHING AWFUL. WHICH IS WHAT I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT. YOU SEE, HE'S NEVER REALLY BEEN GOOD ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIMSELF. WHEN I GO... WOULD YOU KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM? ABRAHAM? HMM. ARE YOU SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO GAY MEN? WHAT? YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING ME THIS. I'M JUST CURIOUS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SEEM VERY COMFORTABLE AROUND THEM. YOU'RE RIGHT. IN A STRANGE WAY, I'VE COME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT BEING A MAN FROM GAY MEN THAN FROM STRAIGHT MEN. REALLY? MEANING I'VE LEARNED THERE ARE OTHER SIDES TO BEING A MAN. THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE THE ARTS, TO REALLY LISTEN TO WOMEN AND BEFRIEND THEM. YOU'RE NOT TURNING SWEET ON ME, ARE YOU? THAT'S NOT THE POINT. LISTEN, WITH GAY MEN, YOU'RE LOOKING AT MEN WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF WOMEN. MEN WHO ARE NOT CONDITIONED BY WHAT WOMEN WILL ALLOW, WHAT WOMEN WILL ACCEPT. MEANING WHAT? MEANING THE SEXUAL LIFE OF A GAY MAN IS PERHAPS WHAT ALL MEN WOULD LIKE, IF LEFT TO THEMSELVES. VARIETY OF PARTNERS, ANONYMOUS SEX. EXCEPT THEY CAN'T GET WOMEN TO AGREE, SO... IS THAT WHAT YOU'D REALLY LIKE? BY THE WAY, THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS NO. I'M ATTRACTED TO YOU. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE NEIGHBORS THINK. HAVE YOU HAD ANY NEGATIVE REACTIONS FROM ANYONE? IF THEY GOT ANYTHING NEGATIVE TO SAY, THEY SURE BETTER NOT SAY IT TO ME. SOME WOMEN FROM OUR CHURCH HAVE COME BY AND BROUGHT FOOD. NOT THAT GORDY WANTS TO EAT ANYTHING. ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT IS TO GET BAPTIZED. Gordon: LAST NIGHT, I SAW JESUS. ♪ ... BE UNBROKEN BY AND BY, LORD, BY AND BY ♪ I WOKE UP, AND THERE WAS THIS CLOUD AROUND MY BED. I WASN'T DREAMIN', MIND YOU. MY EYES WERE WIDE OPEN, AND I COULD SEE MAMA LAYIN' THERE. ♪ WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN... ♪ AND A VOICE SPOKE OUT OF THE CLOUD. "EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT, GORDON." AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT... AND A HAND REACHED OUT TO ME... HALLELUJAH! AND I JUST KNEW IT WAS HIM. I'M READY TO DIE, MATTIE. I KNOW HE'S WAITIN' FOR ME ON THE OTHER SIDE. I KNOW HE'S WAITIN' FOR ME ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S MY COUSIN GRACE TOOTH WHAT DONE THAT. Y'ALL ARE GONNA THINK I'M AWFUL, BUT WHAT THE HELL? SEE, THERE'S MY COUSIN GRACE. SHE WORKS HERE AT THE HOSPITAL. SHE DONE TOLD EVERYONE IN CHESTER HOLLER THAT CLYDE AND I HAVE AIDS. PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE SO DAMN INQUISITIVE. THEY WOULDN'T HESITATE TO STOP A FUNERAL TO ASK WHAT DECEASED THE CORPSE. ANYWAY, GRACE AND HER HUSBAND ANDREW, THEY BEEN GOIN' TO THIS HOLINESS CHURCH. I NEVER GO NO MORE. I CAN'T TAKE ALL THAT BABBLIN' IN TONGUES AND HOLY SPIRIT STUFF. OH, THAT SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME. BUT CLYDE, NOW THAT HE'S SICK, HE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO GO. SO GRACE STANDS UP IN CHURCH, SHE TELLS THE WHOLE GODDAMN CHURCH THAT CLYDE HAS AIDS, AND WOULD THE CHURCH BE WILLIN' FOR HIM TO COME THERE 'CAUSE HE VERY MUCH WANTS TO. DID YOU OR CLYDE ASK HER TO DO THAT? HELL, NO! SHE JUST TOOK IT ON HERSELF TO DO IT. AND BY THE WAY, THE CONGREGATION SAID NO. THEN THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE TO TELL ME THIS. I JUST SAID TO HER, "YOU LITTLE DUMB ASS. WHO TOLD YOU TO GO TALKIN' LIKE THAT? HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT? DON'T YOU EVER SET FOOT IN MY HOUSE AGAIN OR I'LL JACK SLAP YOUR ASS TILL KINGDOM COME." "WELL," ANDREW SAYS, "WE'LL COME VISIT OUR COUSIN CLYDE ANY TIME WE PLEASE." THAT'S WHEN I PICKED UP THE POKER AND WENT AFTER HIM. BUDDY, HE LIT ON OUTTA THERE LIKE HIS PANTS WERE ON FIRE. GRACE WAS JUST STANDIN' THERE. I GOT SO MAD JUST LOOKIN' AT HER FACE, I WENT AFTER HER WITH MY FISTS. I DROPPED HER WITH ONE SHOT, THEN I SAT ON HER AND JUST GIVE IT TO HER. BUST A FEW TEETH, I RECKON. WHOMPED HER REAL GOOD. REMIND ME NOT TO MESS WITH YOU. OH, DOC, I'D NEVER DO THAT TO SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T DESERVE IT. VICKIE, WOULD YOU MIND REMOVING YOUR BANDANNA, PLEASE? I NEED TO DO A FULL EXAMINATION. OH, I'M REAL ASHAMED ABOUT THIS. OH, I'M REAL ASHAMED ABOUT THIS. I DID IT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I JUST SAT IN THE TRAILER AND YANKED IT OUT A HAIR AT A TIME. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. YOU'RE UNDER INCREDIBLE STRESS. IT HAPPENS. THERE'S EVEN A NAME FOR IT. IT'S CALLED... CRAZY. NO, IT'S CALLED TRICHOTILLOMANIA. IT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT FAIR. I KNOW IT ISN'T. DOOCHIE. HEY, MATTIE. DOOCHIE, I WANT YOU TO OPEN UP THAT CASKET. HMM? WELL, MATTIE, YOU SAID YOUR BROTHER WANTED A CLOSED CASKET. HE WANTED IT CLOSED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT I WANNA SEE HE LOOKS ALL RIGHT. YOU GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP. GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THIS CASKET. OH, WHITE SUIT, THE WHITE SUIT. SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. HIS FAVORITE. DOOCHIE, WHY DON'T GORDON HAVE ANY SOCKS ON? MATTIE, WE DON'T USUALLY PUT NO SOCKS ON. I DON'T WANT GORDON GOIN' TO HEAVEN WITHOUT ANY SOCKS. YOU GO GET HIM SOME SOCKS RIGHT NOW. DOOCHIE! EH? WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA CATCH FROM HIM NOW? YOU DONE PICKLED HIS BODY. THERE'S NOT A BUG IN THE WORLD THAT'S GONNA SURVIVE THAT. WELL, MATTIE... OKAY, JUST PUT HIS SOCKS ON. OOH! DOOCHIE! TAKE OFF THEM CAMPIN' GLOVES AND YOU PUT HIS SOCKS ON RIGHT. YOU THINK THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLED UPON TO DO THIS? NOW I WANNA SEE YOU DO IT. OKAY. GET...! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. LET ME HELP YOU. THIS IS WHERE HE WANTED TO BE BURIED. THIS IS WHERE I'D WANT TO BE BURIED, TOO. THAT'S MY PLOT. ( phone ringing ) DR. VERGHESE. DOC, CHESTER'S VERY SICK. HE'S VERY, VERY SHORT OF BREATH, AND HE'S RUNNIN' A FEVER OF 104. DR. VERGHESE, HE'S TURNIN' BLUE ON ME. LANGDON, LANGDON, CALM DOWN. CALL AN AMBULANCE, TELL THEM TO BRING YOU TO THE MEDICAL CENTER. COME STRAIGHT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, AND I'LL MEET YOU RIGHT THERE, OKAY? DOCTOR, NO MACHINES, PLEASE. NO MACHINES. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME, NO MACHINES. WHEN DID HE TELL YOU? JUST NOW? NO, NO, A LONG TIME AGO. DID HE PUT IT INTO WRITING? NO. ( Chester gasping ) GET A GOWN, GOGGLES AND MASK READY FOR ME. SHOULDN'T WE CALL AN ANESTHETIST? WE HAVE NO TIME TO FIND ONE WHO'LL WORK ON AN AIDS PATIENT. THIS IS DR. VERGHESE. THESE ARE CHESTER'S BROTHERS. CAN I TELL THEM WHAT'S GOING ON? TELL 'EM EVERYTHING. CHESTER IS VERY SICK. HE HAS AIDS. RIGHT NOW, HE HAS A BAD PNEUMONIA, SO I HAVE TO PUT HIM ON A BREATHING MACHINE IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES OR HE WILL DIE. BUT LANGDON TELLS ME CHESTER HAS EXPRESSED A DESIRE NOT TO BE PUT ON THE MACHINE. HE SAYS HE NEVER WANTED TO BE ON NO MACHINES. WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS. WE HAVE NO TIME. I NEED TO GO RIGHT BACK IN. THEN PUT HIM ON THE BREATHING MACHINE IF YOU HAVE TO. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN. ( Langdon weeping ) WE ARE HIS FAMILY. WE ARE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM. LANGDON, I HAVE TO GO IN. ( whispers ) CHES. I HAD, WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE FINAL MOMENT, GIVEN CHESTER'S BROTHERS THE POWER OF FAMILY, NOT LANGDON. I, TOO, HAD BETRAYED BOTH OF THEM, BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOOK BACK NOW. BRING HIM DOWN. ( gurgling sounds ) COME ON, ABE, YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN DO IT. BAG HIM. HELLO. ALLEN, I NEED SOME HELP. SADIE, DID YOU KNOW INTUBATION WAS INVENTED BY A PHYSICIAN NAMED O'DWYER AS A LIFESAVING MEASURE IN DIPHTHERIA? MM-MM. IT IS, THEREFORE, AN INFECTIOUS DISEASES PROCEDURE. YEAH, RIGHT. I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND. ( pager beeping ) ( phone ringing ) DR. VERGHESE, YOUR FRIEND ALLEN CALLED. YOUR WIFE'S BEEN ADMITTED. YOU'RE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. I WAS TOTALLY AT THE MERCY OF GOD OR NATURE. GIVEN ALL THAT I HAD SEEN RECENTLY, ALL THE SUFFERING, ALL THE SADNESS, AN EASY, UNCOMPLICATED BIRTH SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH TO HOPE FOR. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO BUY YOU A CIGAR. CONGRATULATIONS, DOC, IT'S ANOTHER FINE SON! LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, DOC. WITH A BOY, ALL YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS ONE DICK IN TOWN. WITH A GIRL, YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THE DICKS IN TOWN. WITH A GIRL, YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THE DICKS IN TOWN. WHERE WERE YOU? I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I WAS AT AN EMERGENCY, AND I RUSHED RIGHT OVER. SWEETHEART, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE. LET'S MAKE THIS A NEW BEGINNING. I PROMISE YOU, THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE. THEY'LL CHANGE. I'LL WORK HARD TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR US. FOR THE KIDS. DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE JACOB? WHERE IS HE? HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU. Woman on P.A.: DR. VERGHESE, CODE BLUE. DR. VERGHESE, CODE BLUE. GO, BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE STEPHEN WITH YOU. COME ON, STEPHEN. COME ON, BABY. CLAIRE. CLAIRE! HE'S HAD ANOTHER AMP OF BICARB. STOP CPR. HE'S ASYSTOLIC. THERE'S NO OUTPUT. WE'VE BEEN GOIN' AT THIS LONG ENOUGH. LET'S CALL IT. THANKS, EVERYBODY. I DIDN'T THINK HIS HEART WOULD QUIT SO QUICKLY. I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER FEW MONTHS. WELL, THEY'RE ALL GONNA DIE, AREN'T THEY? THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT TO THIS. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S THE POINT IN KEEPING 90-YEAR-OLD PATIENTS WHO ARE BRAIN DEAD ALIVE? OR IF YOU WERE IN THE SAME BOAT, WOULD YOU LIKE AN EXTRA YEAR OF LIFE? OR WOULD YOU THINK THERE'S NO POINT TO THAT?! OR WOULD YOU THINK THERE'S NO POINT TO THAT?! PICK YOUR BATTLES, ABE.

THANK YOU. YES? ABRAHAM, IT'S SARAH PRESNELL, FROM KENTUCKY. I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT HOME, BUT I HAVE A SAD, SAD SITUATION HERE. A WONDERFUL MAN I KNOW, LLOYD FLANDERS, IS INFECTED WITH HIV. NOBODY BUT ME, NOW YOU, KNOWS THAT HE'S INFECTED. NOT EVEN HIS SON AND DAUGHTER KNOW. I CAN'T TREAT HIM. I'M WILLING TO TREAT HIM, BUT EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS HIM. HE'S A PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY. HOW DID HE GET IT? HE HAD A HEART ATTACK. THEY DID OPEN-HEART SURGERY AND GAVE HIM A TRANSFUSION, JUST WEEKS BEFORE THEY STARTED SCREENING BLOOD. SO YOU WANNA SEND HIM OVER? TONIGHT, IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU. OKAY. RIGHT. VERY GOOD. MR. FLANDERS? OH. DR. VERGHESE. OH, I'M JUST DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU. HOPE, THIS IS DR. VERGHESE. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. ADMIT THEM. I'LL FILL OUT THE FORMS LATER. YES, DOCTOR. THANK YOU. ALLOW ME. THANK YOU. OH, IT'S EASIER FOR THE QUEEN TO SLIP OUT OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE THAN IT IS FOR US TO BE GONE FROM HOME. SARAH TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR SITUATION, DIDN'T SHE? YES, SHE DID, MR. FLANDERS. CALL ME LLOYD, SON. ALL RIGHT, LLOYD. NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW WE HAVE AIDS. WE? WHAT? I GAVE HOPE THE VIRUS. WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW. BABY KEPT ME AWAKE TILL NOW. I THINK IT COULD BE COLIC. AS WE WALKED DOWN THAT CORRIDOR, I FELT AS IF THEY WERE MY PARENTS. OR A FAVORITE UNCLE AND AUNT WHO WERE SICK AND NEEDED MY HELP. AND I FELT GUILTY. I MEAN, I NEVER ESCORT MY PATIENTS UP TO THEIR ROOM. I NEVER CARRY THEIR LUGGAGE. WHY WAS I DOING ALL THIS? MAYBE BECAUSE I, TOO, THOUGHT THEY WERE INNOCENT VICTIMS. MAYBE I ALSO HAVE A BLIND SPOT. EAT. ABRAHAM. I WONDER WHAT LIES THEY HAD TO INVENT TO TELL THEIR CHILDREN. I WISH THIS DISEASE WAS GONE. THAT YOU WERE NOT SO CLOSE TO IT. IT'S KIND OF BECOME WHO YOU ARE. STEPHEN, JACOB AND I ARE LOSING YOU TO IT. I WISH IT WAS GONE, TOO. ( baby crying ) BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO, IS IT? ( baby crying ) BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO, IS IT? OH! MR. FLANDERS. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? THE SAME. ALWAYS THE SAME. PLEASE. HOW ABOUT YOU? OH, FINE. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP WORRYING. WHY? IT'S SUCH A LONELY BUSINESS TO CARRY THIS BURDEN. I'M SURE YOUR CHILDREN WILL UNDERSTAND. YOUR CHURCH MEMBERS. IF ANYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY KNOWS, NEXT TIME HOPE AND I GO TO CHURCH, IT'LL BE AN EMPTY CHURCH. I THINK YOU'RE WRONG. I HAD A PATIENT HERE WHO HAD THE SUPPORT OF JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY IN HIS CHURCH. I WORRY ABOUT HOPE. WHO'S GONNA LOOK AFTER HER THE WAY SHE'S LOOKED AFTER ME? AFTER I DIE, I DON'T WANT HER TO SUFFER THE STIGMA OF AIDS. WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW OUR CHILDREN WILL REACT TO THIS. HOW WILL OUR SON-IN-LAW FEEL ABOUT US BEING WITH HIS CHILDREN? IT SEEMS SUCH A SHAME TO BE WASTING SO MUCH ENERGY ON KEEPING UP THIS SECRET. THE TWO OF YOU ARE SO ALONE-- ABRAHAM, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. WE ARE NOT ALONE. THE ONE UNSHAKEABLE PRESENCE IN OUR LIFE IS CHRIST. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS VIRUS IS FROM HELL. IT IS NOT FROM GOD. AND I MEAN TO FIGHT IT WITH ALL I HAVE. OH, IT'LL GET ME IN THE END, BUT NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT. I WILL NEVER GIVE IN. NEVER. WHAT? NOTHING. LIKE HELL, NOTHIN'. ( trailer rattles ) THAT'S JUST CLYDE TURNIN' IN BED. YOU COULD FEEL A TICK BURP IN HERE. IT DON'T TAKE MUCH TO SHAKE THAT TRAILER. HOW ARE THINGS BETWEEN YOU AND HIM, VICKIE? ARE YOU STILL ANGRY WITH CLYDE? WELL, I CAN'T GET ANGRY NO MORE. SEE, I LOVE THE MAN. CAN'T HELP IT. I ALWAYS HAVE. COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I LOST IT WITH HIM, THOUGH. I WAS AT THE STOVE, FIXIN' OATMEAL, WHEN HE PIPES UP, "HELL, I THINK I MIGHT JUST GO AROUND AND GIVE THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS I CAN, SEEIN' AS HOW SOMEONE DONE GAVE IT TO ME." I WAS SO SHOCKED, I ALMOST HIT THE FLOOR. I HAD THE OATMEAL IN MY HAND, IT WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN MUCH FOR ME TO FLING IT AT HIM. BUT I SAID, "CLYDE, YOU DONE ALREADY PUT THE DEATH SENTENCE ON TWO PEOPLE. DON'T YOU DARE THINK ABOUT IT, OR I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF, YOU SON OF A BITCH." I ASKED MYSELF, WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO BE IN VICKIE'S SHOES? COULD I HAVE REACTED LIKE SHE DID? WOULD I HAVE HAD HER COURAGE? Clyde: CHANGE CHANNELS. CHANGE CHANNELS! SPEAK OF THE DEVIL. I BET HE'S MESSED HIS PANTS, TOO. CHANGE CHANNELS! OKAY, CLYDE. CHANGE CHANNELS! OKAY, CLYDE, I'M COMIN'. I'M CHANGIN', I'M CHANGIN'. CALM DOWN. THERE. THERE'S BUGS BUNNY. THERE HE IS. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? CLYDE? ZOO. HE STARES AT THE TUBE DAY AND NIGHT. IF I TURN IT OFF, EVEN WHEN HE'S DOZIN', HE WAKES UP MADDER THAN A WET NEST OF HORNETS. I WANNA GO TO THE ZOO. WE'RE ALREADY THERE, BABY. OH, ONE OF MY PATIENTS STARTED THIS SUPPORT GROUP FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND CLYDE COULD TRY ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CLYDE WILL GET OUT OF IT, BUT IT MIGHT HELP YOU. WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO SIT THERE AND TALK WITH A BUNCH OF QUEERS? TRY IT. THIS DISEASE IS TOO MUCH TO CARRY ALONE. HELL, I AIN'T CARRYIN' IT ALONE. EVERYONE IN THIS HOLLER KNOWS. I WISH THEY DIDN'T, BUT THEY DO. HEY, DOC, YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE? IT'S CALLED HEARTS A-BUSTIN'. IT'S ALSO CALLED SWAMP DOGWOOD, BUT I DON'T CARE FOR THAT MUCH. HEARTS A-BUSTIN'. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW I FEEL SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENIN' TO ME. ABRAHAM, YOU'VE GOT IT NOW. NO, NO. ( screaming ) I'M A DOCTOR. A SCIENTIST TRAINED IN PROFESSIONAL DETACHMENT. ALL THE USUAL POSTURES SEEM LIKE A JOKE IN THE FACE OF AIDS. SOMETIMES, I FIND MYSELF THINKING, WHAT IF I WAS A CARDIAC SURGEON? WHAT IF I EARNED A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR? WHAT IF I WAS A RADIOLOGIST WHO PIPES MUSIC THROUGH INTO HIS OFFICE, AND HAS A GAME OF GOLF READY FOR HIM EVERY AFTERNOON AT THE COUNTRY CLUB? YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE, ABRAHAM? I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS PART OF CHRIST'S INTERVENTION, THAT WHEN WE CAME TO JOHNSON CITY FOR TREATMENT, WE FOUND YOU. TO US, YOU'RE LIKE A MESSENGER FROM ANOTHER WORLD. TO US, YOU'RE LIKE A MESSENGER FROM ANOTHER WORLD. MY LIFE IS SLIPPING DOWNHILL FASTER THAN I CAN HANDLE. I CAN'T SEEM TO JUGGLE IT ANYMORE. MY CASELOAD. MY WIFE. MY SANITY. RAJANI TREATS AIDS LIKE IT'S A MISTRESS THAT'S TAKING ME AWAY FROM HOME, SO I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT WHEN I'M AT HOME. I FEEL AS TAINTED BY THIS DISEASE AS MY PATIENTS ARE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME HERE TWO YEARS AGO, I... I FINALLY THOUGHT I'D FOUND MY OWN COUNTRY. NOWADAYS, DEATH SURROUNDS ME. ALL THE JOY HAS DISAPPEARED. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. I MYSELF HAVE LOST ALL LIBIDO. WHAT WAS ONCE AN ACT OF LOVE AND JOY... AN ACT OF LIFE, HAS BECOME AN ACT OF DEATH FOR ME. THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME NOW... BUT HORROR. ( sobbing ) ( Indian music playing ) ( crying ) YOUR PATIENT VICKIE CALLED AN HOUR AGO. HER HUSBAND CLYDE... JUST PASSED AWAY. I COULD THINK ONLY OF ALL THE INEVITABLE CALLS TO COME, AND I WANTED TO RUN. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO THE MAN FOR SO LONG, GOD, I COULD READ HIS MIND. I SAID, "IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY. GO ON. IT'S ALL RIGHT. GOD LOVES YA. GO ON, CLYDE." AND THEN, HE OPENED HIS EYES AS IF HE'D SEEN OR HEARD SOMETHING RIGHT ABOVE HIM, AND, OH, THAT WAS IT. I WANNA THANK YOU, DOC. GOD, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME. OH, VICKIE. VICKIE, VICKIE. VICKIE. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SOMEONE I'VE THOUGHT OF AS A PATIENT I'M PAID TO HELP. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE LIKE A SISTER TO ME. A VERY BRAVE SISTER. WELL, WE ALL GOTTA DIE SOMETIME, RIGHT? HMM. OH, GOOD TO SEE YOU! OH, YES! DR. VERGHESE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILHELMINA. HELLO, WILHELMINA. HI. CAN I GO IN AND SEE GRANDDAD? HE'S WAITIN' FOR YOU. GO ON. I TOLD THEM. I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH. YOUR SON AND DAUGHTER? YES. I DIDN'T WANT LLOYD TO DIE ALONE WITHOUT OUR FAMILY BY HIS SIDE, SO I MADE THE DECISION. DIDN'T TELL HIM. WENT TO THE PHONE AND CALLED. COME IN AND MEET THEM. I THINK I'M READY TO GO HOME, ABRAHAM. THAT'S FINE WITH ME. DR. VERGHESE, WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO HERE. IT'S JUST THAT, AIDS PATIENTS ARE SUCH A BIG DRAIN ON OUR FUNDS. THIS CHESTER MEWS, FOR EXAMPLE, COST US $85,000. THE LIST DOES GO ON. WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE SO MANY AIDS PATIENTS IS BECAUSE OF YOUR REPUTATION? ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE TURN THEM DOWN? AS A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WHICH TAKES PUBLIC FUNDS, ARE YOU NOT OBLIGED TO ACCEPT... NO, I'M NOT SAYIN' WE SHOULD TURN THEM DOWN. I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO ATTRACT THEM, EITHER. DR. VERGHESE, YOU'VE DRAWN PATIENTS FROM THREE DIFFERENT STATES TO THIS HOSPITAL. RIGHT NOW, I HAVE 82 CASES IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. IN FIVE YEARS' TIME, YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT 600 CASES, AND THEY WON'T ALL BE GAY. AND WHEN THIS DISEASE STARTS KILLING STRAIGHT PEOPLE, I HOPE YOU'RE READY. LET'S SEE. LET'S SEE IF AIDS JUST DISAPPEARS LIKE THEY HOPE IT WILL. THEY ACTUALLY THINK I'M BRINGING AIDS TO THEIR HOSPITAL, DISRUPTING THEIR PRECIOUS BOTTOM LINE, THEIR BIRTHING SUITES, THEIR ONE-DAY SURGERY CENTER, THEIR HIGH-TECH MONEY-MAKING RUBBISH! JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT A PROFIT CENTER, MY PATIENTS SIMPLY DON'T MATTER. HELL, IN OTHER HOSPITALS, THEY GOT... THEY GOT WHOLE TEAMS OF DOCTORS. HERE, I'M TREATING 82 PATIENTS ON MY BLOODY OWN! RELAX, DOC. HAVE A BEER. YOU GOT ANYTHING STRONGER? UH-HUH. I WANNA GET SMASHED. ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. GIMME ONE OF THOSE. I DIDN'T KNOW, ALLEN. I DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW DEVASTATED I WOULD FEEL TO WATCH MY PATIENTS DIE. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. TAKE A BREAK, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. START FRESH SOMEPLACE ELSE. I DON'T BLAME YOU, DOC. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DO IT DAY AFTER DAY. HELL, I BLOW AN ENGINE, IT BREAKS MY HEART, AND IT'S JUST AN ENGINE, IT'S NOT A LIFE. NO, I CAN'T SAY AS I BLAME YOU. YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T WANNA SEE YOU GO.
