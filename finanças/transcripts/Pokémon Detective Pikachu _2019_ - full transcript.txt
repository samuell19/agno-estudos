Then why can you in the apartment That's where my father lives. That's why I'm there. You are his son How do you know the name? You're Harry's Pokemon partner You want coffee Because I need coffee, that's all. Right, let's drink coffee. Ya. Come on So that's where I am. Middle of nowhere with cases not yet finished, and memories lost. The only place to stay is the name Harry and the address in this hat. So, I'm looking for a way to get into apartment, and there I met you. I have no idea. Maybe he involved too deep. - Too deep for what problems - Do you know... It often happens to us. The bodies are piled up, the walls are close together. False is correct. False becomes even more wrong. - Wait, who are you telephone - Nobody. Yes, it sounds great. There are a lot of things wrong. Wait, I'm confused what you are heard another voice besides my voice I just wanted to know why I can understand you. I can't help you for that, kid. Like I said I'm amnesia. Okay, so you mean, pikachu can talk, but without memory. And addicted to caffeine. I can stop whenever I want. This is just an option. One more. Duplicated. Look, I'm a great detective. But I can't finish my mystery alone, if I have no memory. Then how are you can you know detective That ... I can feel it in me. What is that? In our body, something you can feel. Where you really believe though other people say you're wrong. That's why me must find Harry. She's the key to my past. - Ready to go - Yeah, thanks, Doc. I have bad news for you because Harry is dead. What Not. No, no... No, Harry isn't dead yet. Late. Sorry. - I've seen the police report if he's already die. - Only because the police thought he was dead. - He is died. - Really Did they find the body I do not think so. And by the way, what is reported they also said that I was dead Because if I'm still alive, that means Harry is also out there. Case is closed. But it's still open. Until I see it myself. I will follow you. Give me a clue. Oh, I'm glad you asked. All right, here it is. Harry falsified his own death. Harry's death, or ... Harry falsified the death of another. - The third does not make sense. - Not. The first and the second make sense. Not. I will go. We are done. This... Wait, wait, wait a minute, where are you going? Wait a minute, we will need each other. No. Not at all. I don't need Pokemon. Point. - You understand - Then what about world-class detectives Because if you want to find your father, I am your best hope. I think a world class detective will know that I'm not looking for my father. I'm here for saying goodbye. give a goodbye. Listen, you can talk to humans, me with Pokemon. We can talk to each other. This doesn't usually happen, kid. There must be meaning. - Really - There's definitely something why are we united together? And that magic is called Hope. Hope that Harry is still alive. Oh, you feel it inside you, no There is nothing inside me. We will do this. You and me. I don't believe ... I'll see you here tomorrow morning Nice. Where are you going To my apartment. What Okay, you can sleep on the sofa. No, I won't sleep on the sofa. Then you can sleep anywhere. Be a good person, please open the door for me. Please. I just invited people to my apartment. I never did this, I'm not a Pokemon like that. You will continue here Fake fingerprints. Something does not make sense. What's going on here I'm looking for a meeting point and instructions. - no! - Does Harry have another child Is this your room Not. small, so he made it like my little room. Damn, we've already discussed that place Your childhood sleep is better than Pikachu. It was a coincidence. Sorry, can you talk louder I can't hear you. I have never felt praised and fear at the same time. Will you make me so mince Oh, maybe. Wait a minute ... All the Pokemon battles, card game, something to do. Ya kan - You love Pokemon. - Not. Yes. Yes, you like it. It's been a long time. spend more time with Pokemon compared to his son. Right, your mother is dead. Well, listen, how about this This photo is in this entire apartment. It has a clear connection with Harry. Maybe he knows me. He can be a clue. Not. That's my mom. He died when I was little. Oh. Sorry I do not... I didn't realize it. Tomorrow morning I'll take you to Lieutenant Yoshida so we can get an answer. My guide! What is this hard, and by the way ... we can't go to the police. Not up to we know who we can trust. So return my instructions according to arrangement, okay Here are instructions like a serial killer. Almost a clue. - What does that mean - I tried fishing my memory. Retrace what I don't remember. That's how I found this. This... called party festive by French people. Not French. Kiss my finger. I will never kiss your finger. Coward. The point is that this R object has something to do with it with the Aipom attack yesterday. - R - Right. Harry has solved the case. Which makes a criminal boss send his men to ... - Why - If we follow Harry's steps and resolve this case yourself ... we can fish with that villain and they will reveal themselves. Can you stop doing that How to login The answer is in this room. This is not a room. But fire place There is a lot of rubbish and ... paper on ... Koran... What can you do, boy I just met someone, he ... junior reporter at CNM. I think he knows more than us. Smart people always have information. We have to go there and make it amazed by our work. - That's a metaphor. - Yes, I know what that means. Yes, I drink it. I drink too. Just go where what you like except stepping on my work. No, no. We don't do that. Okay, I'll walk. I tried to step as much 100,000 steps now. Hello, I'm Roger Clifford, President CNM, and chairman of Clifford's enterprises.

Yes, I know, it doesn't have to be Pokemon to remember it. Harry thinks this man doesn't know anything. I think the trick is into his head. I have an idea. What do you mean What's that? There's a door there. Maybe because the door is not visible. Huh Yes, now you are with me You're very confident right What are you doing It's water jerry cans. You do porn - no. - Salt. You spread salt ... - no. - You're trying to tell he's your main recipe! What are you talking about Gasoline! Oh yeah, it's so dark. I like this once. All right, all right.

The source of R is from a round house Good work kid, maybe you're really talented. Look at that, there's a Pokemon battle! We shouldn't be here. He got it! Using fireballs! Come on, let's look around here. Okay kid, so this is what we know. Harry follows Audrey here. And it's clear that he knows something. We only need to find something and someone. Hey, where is Pikachu's colleague Don't go! I think someone just found us. Who are you! Let's see this will Where. Just say I'm your partner. I am his new partner. There's no way Pikachu is with you. He must have been stolen. That's how I read your faces. Fresh meat. What I hear is all consonants and barks. Hey, do you know He hurt me, man, see this. Forgive me. Forget the coat, where is the shirt This ... this is my place. You know you have come to my place. And saw me become a Pokemon master. - You want to exchange my coat - Okay, coat. Coat, you know ...

I want to win this time, okay What are you doing? What is your attack plan? just see what happens next. This is it. Obviously I've been faced with him, so I will do it again. I pull my word, he explained put something in there. Hey, like you said, okay You have done it before. Use your strength, use an attack fast, discharge, or electro bolt. But I think bolt attacks are the best. First of all, where are you from? learn to be a Pokemon trainer. And second, get me out of here! Start! Watch out! I forgot everything he did. I forgot everything ever I do with him. this is. Use the Bolt attack. Attack bolt I'll use thuderbolt! Come on, you can, you can! Come on, come on. Hey buddy, what are you doing?

Tell me what you know! The man you are looking for to know about R. He knows from the doctor, that all I know. Step aside! Nice catch, boy, let's get out of here! - I have an idea. - This won't work! This is the worst! Magickarp will be able to change Gyrados with small stimulus, be careful of water! In my head I saw this differently. Hey man, I'm not floating. I already said Magickarp is not useless. You're detained. I think you can't stand out of town. I do not understand. Harry isn't dead yet. If it's a Pokemon partner still alive then he too. That's not proof, boy. - Tell him about chemistry ... - Give me time. Harry's case has something to do with dark fight, that's why I'm there. - There is chemistry. - We are investigating. - Harry knows it and he's in trouble! - This has been completed! Reopen his investigation, he out there, I can feel it. Continue Alex. I just want to talk. I could feel it in my bones. - Not good. - Stop! we are partners, so ... Tim, I know it's hard to accept loss ... - Denial ... - No, I'm not denying it! I am right! I know! He is out there. I never want to show this to you. But I think it's important for you to see it. No one can survive from an accident like that. Even your father. He is gone, Tim. I shouldn't have taken the train. After my mother died ... my father and i went to the park. He moved here and worked seriously. In the end he tried to I'm close to him, but ... I want to go. How can I don't think he cares. I think I'm used to not being near him and ... I can't give it to him. Until I'm here, and ... it turns out he cares. But.. I do not know, so me don't give it a chance. And now it's too late. I really.. I really miss his voice on the train. Listen, kid. Look, I don't have memories, but I know. That's not your fault. Not anyone's fault. he will hug you with close up your bones out. And he will tell him sorry for everything. He will be proud of you, son. I'm not being too kind to you. No, you are already very good. Well .. - There is still one mystery to solve. - What Your mystery. Let's find out who who does this to you. - To remember again. - I want. I want. It's a criminal's car. - Thank you, Miss Norman. - Thank you Miss Norman, that's enough. Norman Plavernaut. Please come in. Wow. Flareon. Imagine being able to evolve into the best version of yourself. Greatness in you, waiting to be raised. - Hello team. - He knows you I see you partner with Pikachunya Harry. And he also knows me. You know Harry Harry's case has been done. - That's because of me. - It's a twist, very twisty. This concoction endangers everything I build. He knows about R. How can he know about R I hired Harry to find out the source. And I was very surprised because the culprit is my own child. the mob between humans and Pokemon. A companion where Pokemon to get the best out for us. And because I did that, I ignored my responsibility as a parent. Roger hates Pokemon. I think he sneaked in my shadow blades all this time. He really wants to destroy my inheritance. Well, there's no father's problem without a father figure. But sir, how can you let him do that Since I got sick on this chair, Roger has taken over this company. Managing the board, he too controlling police and politicians. And he has a press. that's why you have to find him. You heard that Harry died. Oh no, Tim, your father is still alive. Watch out! Advanced hologram image. Since I was stuck in this chair, I invested the world for me. These are recreated from police recordings, this makes us able to see things ... which they cannot see or don't want us to see it. He is still alive. That's me, I'm with Harry in this accident. He needs my help. If Harry is still alive, why they can't find it - What is that - Mewtwo. Created in the lab using DNA from ancient Meow fossil remains. I do not believe that. If he comes from Mew, so do we is watching the strongest pokemon in the world. That's it, that's what happened to me. Mewtwo erases my memory. But why Wait, wait, wait! Wait.. Wait, where did he take it It is your job to solve it. Find Mewtwo and you will find your father. The second chance is a special case, son. Will make me better if we can solve this. But there is one question, where are we? walk, you told me. Okay, if it's Roger Clifford is the key to all this, So we need people who know him. Then we both know who that person is. - Men lovers. - Okay, come on, don't start again. There he is. Why with a black glasses can he see us I don't think he can see us. - Hey, thank you for coming. - Don't talk to me. Okay. - What happened - Start normally. But don't look at me. There is nothing ordinary about this. Look at this. Forgive me. Never mind, why don't you just sit here You want to sit with us I should never trust it to you. - I have access to Roger's computer. - Oh wow, how do you do it? I spilled kapucino in his lab. Ah, it seems like a waste of coffee. So I started to see all the notes, I target property in that area and crosscheck it with city records ... about financial business and I found this. I offer PCL, Pok√©mon's Genetic Research Facility. - But that's not all. - He's good. Last week, PCL experienced incidents and must turn off all facilities. no one knows why. It's really dark. What does all this mean, I don't know. This is very interesting, are you interested - Ya. - I think he's nervous. - So ... - Yup, it's me, only me. So there is a closure. But... What they cover What do you think if we find out So I straighten this, we are forced to listen This SPA music so you don't explode ... and kill us all. Pikachu is very unnatural. You lower it! I will not massage you! I never knew there was a Pokemon wearing a hat. He is weird. Of course I care my partner's life, here is your leg! What are you doing! What It's okay, what I'm curious about. It was the chief scientist of PCL, Dr. Laurent. I'm sure this is the Doctor Shirtless talked about. He was convicted of experimenting with Pokemon to control their thoughts. He is basically neurological pokemon. Maybe this doctor can know the psychological effects long term because it's tied in a baby chair .. next to a bomb! This is it. Look at the sign. It's a bad idea. Remember that these are all bad things You must always be alert all the time. Yes, it works. Girl, this girl likes danger. You want to get his heart, you have to take it right there. Okay, okay. First, women do not like to be called so. Second, women appreciate the intake calm and responsible decisions. What is he doing Hey Hey! Hi! Lucy, what are you doing I ... I cut the fence so we can enter. No ... where you got it from - Don't think about that. - After you, Psyduck. No, I'm first, whatever the move is dangerous. Okay. It is okay. You stay here. Even though I'm amnesia, but this the worst place I've ever entered. What is that I am not sure. Psyduck! It's Pokemon, they don't look healthy. Test 22, adding strength - They are experimenting. - But why Roger Clifford behind this what is he did experiment with Pokemon Tortera Park. Pokemon Test 23. Addition of growth. They look normal to me, Maybe the reaction isn't yet visible. It seems they are trying manipulate Pokemon evolution. I do not know. I need all the documents. You first, I will follow later. - sure - Ya. - What is this - Bad things. Very bad. Still thinking this is just the setting Boy, hey, here! This is the station Dr. Laurent. It looks like it still works. Remote access starts. Oh, Psyduck! It seems that all the files are encrypted. Oh oh ... hologram again. After all the experiments and errors, finally the method of extracting Mewtwo's DNA. This will be exciting, just wait. 316 clinical trials proved successful. We can result from confusion and the loss of free will. Which makes Pokemon wild. Which is called serum R. - They use Mewtwo to make R. - And test it to Pokemon. Your 68. Neural link operates. Attention, red conditions. We are exhausted! That's a bad way to die. Now we achieve something. Then what's the connection with Harry Good question. I will try to take us to the beginning. So we need now get the strongest pokemon in nature. Mewtwo. He fled 20 years ago from the Kanto area. We have sent specialists to looking for. Good luck, detective Goodman.
