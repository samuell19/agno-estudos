You sighed, frowned, and you even said, This sucks? Are you all kidding me? Are you kids? Who groaned? Were you right or wrong? Wrong. Don't think this is harsh for your first day. You have to behave first for me to behave, got it? Yes, ma'am. Also, just because I came late today doesn't mean you can. Got it? Yes, ma'am. That's all you can say? Kim Ka-eun. Lee Seung-eun. Park Soh-ra. Kim Bo-mi. Oh Eun-seok. Kim Jin-ho. Kim Hwan-young. Min Cho-hee. Kim Beum-su. Hey, I heard you transferred here last year. You don't seem to know our homeroom teacher. You better watch out, got it? If we suffer because of you, you could die. What? Playing tough? Hey, do I look dumb to you? let go! Let go! Hey, Let go! This is humiliating. - Ms. Yeo. - Yes, sir! Busy, aren't you? A moment ago, you seemed to be a bit rough on the kids. - If you'd just... - Sir! Think I'd do that to the first or second graders? They're in fifth grade. If I don't take control now, they'll get their way the whole year. You know that. I do, but what if a parent protests. Come on, sir. No one will, so don't worry Trust me, okay? What is it? You told me to see you after I clean up. - I did? - Yes, ma'am. Right, don't be late. You can go. Pardon? I said go. Don't you have after-school lessons? - Is that all? - Yup Teaching Test Preparation Classes Pink slip Why all of a sudden? You were working hard until now. I'm sorry, sir. Ms. Yang. Think it over. We've only started school for two days. Ms. Yang. The test is in November anyway. You can prepare for the test while you keep teaching. I thought I could at first. But I think it would be better if I studied in Seoul. This is so aggravating! Why'd my perfectly running jeep die at a traffic light? Shouldn't it run 30 kilos more with the empty light on? No? Was it 20 kilos? What? What's going on? This is very bad. Teachers are leaving for big cities to take the appointment test. I really don't get them. And the number of teachers like us in rural schools is falling. So are the students. I know they want to work in good conditions, but... I knew Ms. Yang would do that! Actually, I heard her fianc is in Seoul. Kids are more important than a guy, don't you think? You all do what you think is right. Do what that's right? That's not what education is all about. - He's right. - I guess so. Let's just drink up! Stop coming here and go home after you get tutored. Can't I wait for you? Who knows when I'll be done. Go straight home and call me, okay? Go ahead. What's great about my life? You're better off than me. Then you come down here and teach instead. I screwed up. I should've gone with you. No, there's no vision here. It's all the same. I'm bored as hell. Yeah. Tutoring? I signed up for weekend classes. Hey, you think it's still easy? Even if I give it my best, I still don't know. The weekend? I got lessons only on Sunday. Hey, I'll call you back when I get home, okay? - On your way from getting tutored? - Yes, ma'am. Are you taking late classes, too? Well, I guess. What are you learning? I hate getting tutored, I just want to go to school, but my mom keeps... It's here! Bye! Mister! Are you okay? Are you okay? Can you get up? It could've been awful. Are your knees okay? What shall I do? Let's go to the hospital first. I'm okay! I'll just go. This is our new art teacher. Applause. Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you all. Say hello. Hello. Nice to meet you. Welcome. I'll call you later. Ms. Yeo! Our new teacher, Mr. Kwon. Say hello. Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you. I waited too long. Where've you been? I thought I was going to die single. I hate you. Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you. Yes, nice to meet you. How about another round of applause for Mr. Kwon. Everyone, get ready for class. Mr. Kwon Don't be too nervous. - Your first class is at 2:30, right? - Yes. They're a bit rowdy. - Really? - Yes. Next time... Tell me when my class is next. I'll talk to the students beforehand. Okay, thanks. Bye Good luck. Mr. Kwon. Did you know that my room is your first class? Of course. Just wanted to tell you not to be intimidated by them. Okay, thanks. One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, go, go, go. Oh goodness. Please go ahead. - You'll have to go first. - Oh, right. Louder! Louder! So who does the greeting call? Attention! Bow to the teacher. Hello! Nice to meet you all. I will be your new art teacher. My name's Kwon Sang-choon. It's an awful name, isn't it? Yes But you can't make fun of it, okay? Yes Since I'm nervous about my first class, you have to be nice to me, okay? Yes. Now, shall I get to know my first students? Mr. Kwon! Do you have a girlfriend? Girlfriend? Not before, but I think I do now. - Who? - Who is it? That very person is all of you. Now, let's begin roll call. I was just like Mr. Kwon. when I was young. You all object? Let me tell you about the time when I first taught. You saw that bridge, right? We didn't have one. We crossed back and forth on a boat, and all this was mountain area. Mr. Kwon, you're a great young man. - That's right. - Great indeed. You came all the way here on your own to teach. We have to think highly of this. Young teachers these days are dying to go to the big cities. We have to admire a person like Mr. Kwon. That's how education survives. Don't you all think so? Let's not lose our courage. Everyone, let's toast. To Mr. Kwon, our new teacher. To Mr. Kwon! Thank you. Stop! The wave. Bottoms up. The wave! The wave! The wave! The wave! - Sir, the wave! - The wave! Bottoms up! He's inside right now. He's so cute. You have to see him. I gotta go. Running away? - Are you running away? - Pardon? You look like you're running away. I'm on my way to the bathroom. You can't run away for real. Then his face got bright red, and he peed all over his pants. So then I throw a joke at him. Be careful. Our country has a shortage of water. Stop saying the same story over and over again! Come on, mom. Then he smiled and said I ought to be a comedian. Stop it! What lunatic would say such a thing after he pisses on his pants? I'm telling you he did! Just go to sleep and stop reeking of alcohol! Mom, when will you be home? I understand. My girlfriend is... Oh my god! Ms. Yeo... You scared me! What are you doing here? Here? I left something in the art room. You did? Then you better find it. So this is the new art room. Two came out of the machine. Why isn't the bird poop coming off? You're here early! Oh, hi! How are you... Take the picture. Be quiet Hey, Mi-nam. Are you hurt anywhere? - Are your knees okay? - Yes, sir. Do you know how scared I was then? I don't know. Yes, you do. I'm supposed to take you to a hospital or else it's a hit-and-run. Since you're not hurt anywhere, I'm relieved. But who knows? I could be in pain later. Well, if you feel any pain at all tell me right away. Then give me your cell phone number. Sure. My cell number is... This is my cell number. - Go on. - Yes, sir. Hey, Mi-nam. What were you two talking about? You got his number, didn't you? Yup. You're pretty tough. So what's his number? Ask him yourself. What is it? My sixth grade friends. Hey, she looks pretty well off. She looks rich as hell. I'll cut it short. You have the art teacher's number, right? Spit it out. What is it? 016-766-6648. Got it? 766 what? 6648. Done? Hey, what's so tough about her? She's nothing. See 'ya. He gave flowers and presents. Here you all are. - Hello! - Hello! Mr. Kwon, have a seat over here. Move over. - Have a seat here. - It's okay. Please sit. - Did you get home okay yesterday? - Yes, I did. Did you have a bad hangover? - No, I'm okay. - That's a relief. Since everyone said it was too bad we all didn't go for another round, I'll treat you all to dinner and karaoke. - Wonderful! - Oh, Mr. Kwon! Mr. Kwon, shall we go alone? Watch out! Ms. Yeo! You're coming, right? No, I'm not going. What are you doing? Please stop it. Hey, Mi-nam. Do you know who those girls were yesterday? They beat up the middle schoolers. - So? - You gave me the wrong number! I did? Then I guess it wasn't right. - I'm gonna rat on you to them. - Go right ahead. Hello. Hey, Mi-nam! I'll get back to you later! Let's go. You have to study hard. - Tell me the number. - No. I can't tell you. Look at us. What's going on? You call yourself the head of the class? What's going on? Can't you hear me? What's going on? They kept asking me for the art teacher's number. I told them I didn't know, but they... Why are they asking you for his number? He's staying over at my house. - At your house? - Yes, ma'am. It's hot. Help yourself to plenty of food. Anyway, Mr. Kwon must eat separately. He usually eats with us, but he must be late today. Oh, I see. What is it? I have something to tell you. What? Can we talk somewhere else? I'm busy, so let's just talk here. - Actually, I have a dilemma. - A dilemma? What dilemma? Well, the girls in sixth grader keep... Why don't we talk later when I have a lot of time. Okay, go on now. Gyung-soo! Come here, you. - Gyung-soo! Studying hard? - Yes, ma'am. I heard you won an award at the invention contest last year. - Wonderful. What did you invent? - A transforming... Wait, not now. But tell me later for sure. Gyung-soo, you had such a great house. Hi, Mi-nam. Come in. - What's up? - Nothing. - Who is it? - It's Seung-eun. I was drawing each one of you. - Would you like to see yours? - Yes. Okay. How is it? Good. I must've done a bad drawing. You really don't like it? Not at all. Wow, Mi-nam, you're really pretty. - Do you like it? - Yeah. - Well, I had such a great model. - You can say that again. But doesn't the hairstyle look like a mushroom? No, it was just a joke. Mi-nam, you drew wonderfully! You did a great job, Mi-nam. Mr. Kwon. What do you do for dinner? Eat dinner, of course. I thought you only ate lunch. It's not funny? It's funny. I thought you'd laugh. And this is a transforming pencil case. There's times when pencil cases are filled with stuff, so if you open this and take this out, - Twice as more goes in? - Yes. Also, I invented this in second grade. It's a remote to find the remote. When you can't find the remote, if you press this button, It makes a beep sound? Also, this is a glove that's used... Don't you have a girlfriend? I said all of you were. Not that. A real girlfriend. Not yet. Let's eat. It's not slicing well. No? Give it here. I'll slice it for you. Guys usually slice the girl's steak on a date, don't they? Well, maybe or maybe not. Wow, it's great here. - It's pretty, huh? - Yes, it is. Mi-nam, let's go home now. Why? Do you feel strange? What's there to feel strange about? It's just late, so let's go home. I'm okay. It rains in torrents. I have to watch TV news at 9 pm. Mr. Kwon. Have you ever kissed before? Is it true about what they say about kisses? About what? That it's like eating raw octopus. Who says that? That's what I heard. When you kiss, it's very gooey. Mr. Kwon. Let's listen to some music. Shall we? You can't do this. I'm your teacher, for goodness sakes. But I know you love me, too. This isn't just a teacher-student relationship, we're simply a man and woman in love. Okay. I won't hide my feelings any more. Teacher. - I love you! - So do I! I love you! Call me honey from now on. TV dramas are taking it too far. It's a big problem. Hey, this stuff isn't real. This happens only on TV. That stuff is nonsense. It makes me mad. It's boring. How could they end it like that? - Gyung-soo, go to your room. - Yeah, go to your room. Ms. Yeo, here's some money. We should've given it to you earlier. But my wife is really slow on things. Here you go. Ms. Yeo, how could you just leave? I'm very sorry! I've been a big burden! - Take an umbrella, at least! - I'm so sorry. You don't need to see me out! - Hold on! - Good night! Teacher's Test Preparation Book What are you doing in your wet clothes? I'm studying. Look how pitiful you look. - Something happened, hasn't it? - Just get to the point. Come to the elderly home on Sunday. - Why? - Accompany someone on the piano. - I'm teaching a song to... - No, I have to get tutored. You call yourself a real teacher? You have a good job but you want to give it up for another school? Then why teach there? - Because I have reasons. - Like what? - Because of that new art teacher? - Come on! It's not that. If you're going to transfer, then why are you liking him? Don't you feel bad to the students? I get your point. I get it, so please go. - You don't give a hoot. - I got it, so go! Go! Go! Go! - What now? - Change your clothes! Blue! Blue! Growing tall While looking at the blue sky You're all so lucky to be little. Guess who? Who? Take a guess. Okay. It's Mi-nam. What are you doing? I'm drawing a sketch. Hey, it's our Odong Island. Mi-nam, can you sit down next to me while I draw? I'm fine right here. Okay then. What shampoo do you use? - Why? - Just that it smells good. - How is it teaching so far? - It's fun. - And no troublemakers? - None. Come on, there's always one. Well, there is this one special case. I was right. Wait a minute. Who is it? Someone in my class? Well, I don't know if I'm the only one who felt this. You know Mi-nam, right? Oh no, not her again. What did she do? The other students are like kids, but the way Mi-nam thinks or acts is very adult-like. So she's acting like a woman to you. It's nothing serious. Well, yesterday I let her draw me like she asked, but then she wanted me to pay for it. After we took a drive, she even asked me if I've ever kissed before. I didn't know whether to say yes or no. And once, she suddenly hugs me from behind, and... It felt a bit awkward. What should I do about this? So how was it? How was what? Never mind. Let's go see the sea again. How about Saturday? What are you doing? You sent it to the art teacher, huh? What's it to you who I send it to? Yeah? Hey everybody! Mi-nam and the art teacher are dating! Really? - Yeah, they went on a date, and... - Stop it! Stop it? Stop what? Stop what? She's dating the art teacher Reenact exactly how you fought. What? Do it exactly the same. Haven't you seen reenactments on TV? That's how I'll know. I'm sorry, ma'am. Now! What's it to you who I send it to? It's your turn. Hey. Hey. Mi-nam and the art teacher... What? Do it right! Ready and action. Nah, nah, boo, boo. Mi-nam and the art teacher are dating. Stop it. Stop what? Stop what? Continue? Hey, kill her. All of you clean the windows for a week! What? You've had it hard because of us, haven't you? Yeah, it's been hard as hell. - Ms. Yeo. - Yes. What do you think about the girls liking the art teacher? I guess they can. Ms. Yeo. I've also started to like someone. Who? - Me? - Yes. I've liked you from the beginning. But I knew for sure when you rejected the envelope. I felt it right then that I could trust you. Forever. Okay Gyung-soo, I'll see you tomorrow. Can you drive me home? Mi-nam and Mr. Kwon ate dinner at a nice restaurant. And they even went on a drive. I feel that I could do the same with you. Do what with me? Have you lost your mind? Get out! Yes, Gyung-soo. I understand what you're feeling. Since everyone has gone through this once. You see, you're only going through puberty. Wow, I can't believe you've hit puberty already. You have to be careful at this stage. If you're not, you could screw yourself over. Understand? You'Il do well. You will, right Gyung-soo? Yes, but can't I sit in the front? - No. - Okay. Teacher and student affairs Teacher and student of 12 years age difference weds! Mr. Kwon, how the hell are you presenting yourself? Pardon? The kids fight over you all the time! Mi-nam asks you to date her! Does all this make sense? That's why I talked to you. I'm going crazy, too. There's no other way! For the kids to get it straight, just marry me. No! Don't listen to her. Wait seven years. I can marry you then. Oh my goodness, what are you saying? Hey, you expect him to wait seven long years for you? Instead of a hag like you, it's better to wait for a budding chic like me! Stop! Fine, I'll decide right now. Of course, you decide. Who will it be? Mi-nam. Why? Just look at her. In a few years, she'll be... But you don't cut it. See? You're a real sleeping beauty, screaming and crying in your sleep. Did you lose the Miss Korea pageant? You kept crying about your body and breasts. Move out of the way. Wake up! Fine. Let's have a heart-to-heart talk, woman to woman. Forget that I'm your teacher. Talk about what? You like someone, don't you? That's why you're acting up, right? I think you're worse than I am. What? Me? Yes. Mi-nam. Think I'm stupid? You think you can marry him in seven years, don't you? What? So the budding chic thinks she's got what it takes, huh? What are you talking about? Why? Got you on the spot? Feel like I've figured you out inside and out? You're no match to me. Because we grown-ups live in this profound world you kids can't imagine. We've already been to your world. Got it? I don't get it. You don't? Lately, many girls have been imitating adults, so I will conduct an examination. This morning, the Education Ministry put out this special order. Now. Whoever's wearing a bra give yourself up. Everyone get up. Close your eyes. Go. Go. That's fat, so go. Go. To the front! Where did you all get them? All the girls wore push-up bras. They were either their older sisters' or mothers'. Even their grandmother's. - I was blown away. - Even Mi-nam? Of course. She even put socks in hers. Now, I see. So they were socks. Yeah, so next time ignore her, otherwise she'll get worse. I didn't know about this. Thank you so much. Just words won't do. Dinner at least would be... Sure, what do you like to eat? Well, we've already had sushi. Maybe steak or perhaps... What is it? - Ms. Yeo. - What? - It shows too much. - What does? Your push-up bra. Hey! They were already big! They really are big. It must really show. Okay. Pass. Pass. Good. I still see a lot of stains. Where? Here. Here. Here. I don't see them. Odong island looks blurry. Clean it again. What is it? You have to inspect the window. It's okay, so just go. - You have to see it yourself. - I said it's okay, so just go. Let's go. Arabian Nightclub Hey, Gyung-soo. Hi. What is it? Our homeroom teacher told us to come here. - Why? - Because I got something for you. Here. It's to help you study. Bye. It's the art teacher! They're so lucky to go into places like that. What's so lucky about it? It's all evil. Hey. Oh my, I'm sorry. I just thought it was appropriate. While we're here, do you really want to go up? - But I can't dance. - I can't dance either. How about we just check it out? Okay, sure. Have a good night. Come again. It's Mi-nam. If we don't come out in a minute, she'll spread rumors on the website. What? That we went into a motel together. Stupid. Dummy can't even do that. Watch carefully. You need to know the basics. Move! See? Oh no! One guy and one girl!

There was not any special stuffs Time goes by and by And we met another same teachers... It's too pitiful to both of students and teachers We shouldn't do that I can't understand why - It's alright when we are doing good - You know we're doing good King of Inventions. Even if my friends call me Edison, I'm still not the king. - At many contests... - Gyung-soo! Try it again. You need rhythm. My friends call me... Gyung-soo must be nervous. Watch how I say it. Even if, stop, my friends, stop, call me Edison, stop, okay? My friends, even if... It's okay. All you need is practice. Go home and practice a lot, and do a good job tomorrow. - Yes, ma'am. - Good.

So you don't want to hear my fun story, huh? No, please tell us. I'm not a boring person, you know. This could also be a sad story. During college, I went on my first date, and this guy fell in love with me at first sight. I didn't like him so much, but he chased me for five years. Everyday, he'd give me flowers, gifts, letters... - Ms. Yeo! - Yes? Let's just have class. Hey, Mi-nam! I put up my hair for the first time. Is it pretty?

Where have you been? - Come on, mom. - You! How have you been behaving at school for your teacher to be so worried? - I did nothing wrong. - You did nothing wrong? You've been misbehaving in class, and talked back to the teacher? Is that how I raised you? And who have you been with lately to come this late? Didn't I tell you to come straight home after your tutoring? - I hate being in an empty house. - What? I hate being home alone. But you shove me away from your work when I want to stay! I can't bring my friends to this crappy house! And I hate you working at a tent bar! And why do you trust my teacher over me? She doesn't like me! That's why she said that! Hey... Expressing myself through 'poetry' - Gyung-soo, would you like to start? - Yes, ma'am. The King of Inventions. Even if my friends call me by Edison, I'm still not the King of Inventions. Although I've won many prizes, I'm still not the King of Inventions. What I really want to invent is the very machine that will make you love me. A round of applause! Yes, our Gyung-soo expressed his feelings well. But what could be his one error? Min Cho-hee? He expressed his feelings too directly Cho Ah-young? I agree with her opinion. Yes, both of you are correct. A poem is different from a prose, so through similes, metaphors, illustrations, and symbols we express our minds with short and rhythmical writing. - Understand everyone? - Yes, ma'am! - Next... - Ms. Yeo! I want to present my poem. - Since we don't have time... - Ms. Yeo! I also want to present my poem, ma'am. Then why don't you go ahead. Quickly. Title, Old Single Female. Your heart is like a summer's weather forecast. No one knows when it'll rain or shine. You make everyone nervous around you, yes, the Old Single Female. You're like a solitary speck in the sky. Afraid of spending a long night alone. Yes, the Old Single Female. Old Single Female! Be born as a day-fly in your next life. Since you'll only last a day. The older you get the harder marriage is. Yes, you are our homeroom teacher. What the hell is this? In front of all the school inspectors! Are you playing around? What is this? I'm sorry, sir. How weak did you look to the kids for them to take advantage of you? That girl Mi-nam. She looks down on teachers. If you can't even control one kid, then quit! This is an outrage. You said you'd take control. What did you control? Goodness, gracious. Um... Please stop the punishment. Go to your desk. - I know this is because of me. - I said go. - Punish me instead. - That's enough! Go! Why are you punishing them? - I said go! - Punish me instead! - Watch your damn mouth. - Go back to your desk. You're not worth teaching. How dare you do that to me? Is that how your parents raised you? Aren't you embarrassed for your parents? Assembly Hall for Elders What's gotten into you to come to the market with me? Mom. Should I quit teaching? Why? Just because. I don't think it suits me, and I lack the skills to teach. - How much? - 7,000 won. Give me one. Here you go. Being a teacher isn't hard. Anyone who becomes a role model for others is a teacher. It's hot. Let's eat. It would've been better if your dad hadn't passed away early. Mom, how could you always say the same thing at dad's ritual? Remember when you liked your elementary school teacher? - Me? - Yeah. You said you were gonna marry him, so you entered the writing contest. I don't remember. You were in the first grade. Your homeroom teacher married the teacher in the class next door, and you had a fit for a few days and didn't go to school. No, I didn't. Do you know what I was feeling then? I think since he was as good to you like your father, perhaps you had reacted that way. Please move a little closer. Here we go. One, two... Ms. Yeo. Come to my office. All of you be careful. And take precautions. Turn it on. What the hell is going on? Cell phones are a big problem. - What? Cell phones? - I'll take precautions. Why did you do it? Just for fun. What? Fun? You call that fun, you brat? Do you know what happened because of what you did? - Go back to your seat. - What? I'll take care of it. Go back to your seat. - You! - Go back. So what will you take care of? Think this is simply your problem only? If this gets out of hand, our teachers will... - The principal is here, too. - Good. How could you hit a student in the classroom? Our kids shouldn't get hit in a school like this! - Let's go to another school! - Please, no. - Do you know what times these are? - It's not what you think! Please quiet down! She got hit because she deserved it. It's not as serious as you all think it is. - How can we trust that? - Yeah! You kids tell us. Is the principal right? - Tell us. - Did she deserve to get hit or not? See? The kids must not be in a situation to talk. Let's have them take a vote instead. Yeah, a vote. Great idea! A vote! Wait, please try to understand. What are you doing? Please stop this. Deserved to get hit: 24 Didn't deserve to get hit: 1 If any kids deserved it, then they must get hit, right? Of course! Of course! Kids lately have it too easy. Yeah, when we went to school, we got pulverized. Yeah, they need to get hit to mature. How about a refreshing cold drink in my office? - Yeah, we can't disturb the class - Let's go. Pink slip Ms. Yeo! What are you doing? Everything has been solved. It's not because of that, sir. I was planning on quitting. What? To be honest, I was studying for the teacher's test. But now it's not because of that. I just think I'm not worth being a teacher any more. Ms. Yeo. How many teachers in this country do you think they're worth being a teacher? I know very well you've had a hard time with Mi-nam. For now, I'll let you off temporarily, so think it over. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to make you come all the way here. Not at all Having to work this kind of job gives me no time to raise her. But I thought she was okay this time since there was no trouble. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. No, it's all my fault. Mi-nam wasn't such a bad girl before. But after her father passed away two years ago, she changed. Her father passed away? Yes. His life revolved around her. He did everything for her and raised her like a princess. Anyway, I'm so sorry. You don't need to see me out. Good-bye. Mi-nam. You're going to school tomorrow, right? I came to apologize. I'm really sorry. To tell you the truth, I've liked the art teacher the day I first saw him. But I must've gotten jealous seeing you get close to him. I'm pretty foolish, huh? Think I acted that way because of him? You've ignored me ever since the first day. That day I waited an hour for you in the classroom. But do you even know what you said? In order to get close to you, I came late to school on the first day. You even brushed me off at the bus stop. Also, I wanted to talk to you about being picked on, but you talked to Gyung-soo instead. My mom always comes home iate, so I wanted to be your friend, but you didn't care about me, and only the art teacher. Mi-nam. I quit the school. I didn't do it because of you. I had planned on it. So go to school and do your best. From what I heard earlier, your mother worried about you a lot. Be better to your mom. And approach your friends first. I'm sorry I couldn't be good to you. I really am. In the hills, the trees are growing In the fields, the grain is growing On the branches, the fruits are growing They are growing well in the rain. Today I'll talk about color changes. Everything is growing in our land Why aren't you all singing? How long do we have to listen to the principal's song? Until the next teacher comes. But who knows when. Ms. Yeo was good at singing at least. You're right. Wanna come over to my house? Hey, she's poor as hell. Let's eat. - You're surprised, huh? - Yeah, a little. I didn't lie because I was embarrassed. But you know how the kids are stuck up. That's why. I'm really sorry. Hey, it's okay. It happens. - This is really delicious, huh? - Yeah, it is. - Got any rice? - Yeah, I do. No, it's okay. I'll eat it later. This is good. Help yourself to plenty. Teacher's Day Kids, come buy some flowers!
