[wind gusting] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [cries out in pain] &lt;i&gt;Back-up generator online.&lt;/i&gt; [munching] [coughs] Water. How much is here? How much food do we have? Anything? Maybe a day's worth. Probably less. Fuck. We're very low on water, sir. Take this. Drink the rest of it. Go on. And an MRE, too. You need to eat. You come first, sir. Class Ones come first. I was born to die. Class Ones are born to live. Don't fuckin' spout your damn slogans at me. We've poisoned your mind, with that shit. You take care of yourself and go find something to eat. Go on. [power shutting down] &lt;i&gt;Warning, power failure.&lt;/i&gt; We need to make it into Building Alpha, get into the corporate shelter. Over in the main colliery. It's the only chance we have. But won't it be there? It has access to Alpha. We have to try for the corporate vault. They have a second kitchen there. They've got stores of food, stockpiles of supplies. We can hole up there, stay safe until we're rescued. &lt;i&gt;Back-up generator online.&lt;/i&gt; [Barklay]: We've been safe in the steam tubes so far, sir. What if we move nearer to the acid baths? We could hide there... It doesn't have the necessary fingerprints for access here. We'll die if we stay here, Barklay. We'll freeze to death if the steam tubes lose power. We'll die of thirst, or worse. It knows about the steam tubes. It knows everything we know. It's gonna find its way in here eventually. We won't be safe here. I'm going to teach you how to use this. You're going to get us across to the second facility. You're Canary Class, right? Yes, sir. Canary Class Synthetic. C class labour. Right. Pick it up. We're not allowed to, sir. Do what I say, dammit! I don't give a fuck about your rules and laws anymore. Canary Class workers have access to firearms with a biometric override. There. I've unlocked this rifle for you, all right? This is the only way. Now pick up the fucking gun! &lt;i&gt;Back-up generator online.&lt;/i&gt; There's a bolt on the side. You got to pull it back to cock it? Right here. Do it. Grab it. Pull it back. Yes, that's it. Okay. Now it's ready to fire. All right, you got to put the butt into your shoulder. Pull it. Really hard. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Now, it's going to kick when you fire, but no more than the pneumatic drills you're used to. Just don't let it surprise you. You make sure you hit that motherfucker. All right, put the gun down. Barrel away from me. Two mags, that's it. No more ammo. 60 rounds. I still got my handgun. Good explosive rounds. It's backup. -You got a bag? -Yes, sir. Then grab it. [coughs] Get all the food and water. Bring it here. [gasps] Oh, something's not right. I feel like there's a light... There's a light inside of me. I can-- [groans in pain] It's shining out from me. [high-pitched screeching] [gasps] Something's wrong. It was Richard. I know what he means now. I feel like that. Corlove-- he cut one of those things open-- it had 40 rat brains inside, just linked together, making a working brain. Holebrook, you see, he stole pigs from the pens, he cut the pigs' organs out, and he strung them all together with sheep organs. He made those things. It was that light. It was the light. It told him to. It made him. Then Holebrook, he... he cut up all those miners. Cut them all up. And he made that big one out of them. Then they cut open that rock, and I saw that light, Barklay. I saw it, and I knew right away. I knew it. I felt it. I felt it right away, that... I cut my eyes out when I saw that light. But I was too late. I was too late. [clattering] We're going to get the fuck out of here, all right? That's your gun. Take it. Come lift me up. Come on, here we go. Help me up. [groans] [alarm sounding] &lt;i&gt;Power restored.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Back-up generator online.&lt;/i&gt; Now, when we open that door, we've got about 100 metres to go to the second facility. It has the biometrics to get through. It's coming, no matter what we dc. You aim straight. You aim straight, you fucking hear me? Yes, sir. Can you see? Dc you have lights? Yes, sir. Here's your mask. We only get one chance at this. Don't stop. We go absolutely straight. 100 metres to Facility Alpha, understand? Yes, sir. Follow the beacon. Go, go! [Barklay]: Get up, sir! Please! [Quinn]: Hold me! Hold me! [groaning] &lt;i&gt;Compromised security on John Quinn.&lt;/i&gt; [Quinn gasping and groaning] [coughing] Where do we go? The managers' complex. It's up ahead. The living quarters, meeting rooms-- those rooms are fortified. &lt;i&gt;Declined. Insufficient status. Declined.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Insufficient status.&lt;/i&gt; It's at the door. Just keep moving. We can't keep it out. [growling] &lt;i&gt;Authorized. Private Phillip Marshall.&lt;/i&gt; Get the gun ready! [roars] [roars] Reload! Reload! [creature screeching] You're out! Let's go! Move, move! [roaring] &lt;i&gt;Atmospheric leak, sections A through C.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Commence evacuation procedure.&lt;/i&gt; There's a kitchen up ahead. The door's manual. Go in. Bolt the door! [Barklay]: Sir, we have to go. Please, sir. Take it, Barklay. I'm going to tell you where to go. Take the gun. What? Just take it. We're so close... Christ, I'm-- I'm fucked up. There's something wrong inside of me, I'm telling you, I can feel it. There's something wrong. It's getting worse. It's that thing-- it rejects synthetics. Maybe I can slow it down. Synthetics must be used as mining labour. Protocol 7, statute 9. But do you know how much true synthetics cost? The overhead involved? Synthetics... they cost more than orphans. We purchased you from the Strata Group. The company bought you when you were two weeks old. You're a fucking human, Barklay. That barcode we put on you was to fool the OSHA inspectors. We bought a couple of synths just to fool them. You're Canary Class, right? What's their job? Your job is to crawl down in the mineshafts, deep down into the asteroids. Your job is to die if you walk into a pocket of poison gas, right? Now, do you think a synthetic would get sick like that? Here, take the gun. Take it. You're going to get out. You're going to tell everyone about this place-- about you, about who you are. About the quartz, how it flashes. You tell them. The computer's never going to reject your status. You're going to take my fingerprint and you're going to get out of here. [creature shrieking] Now, remember, when this thing-- when it gets to me-- it's going to extract everything I know. It's going to know about the vault. [screeching] You're going to make it, Barklay. [pounding on door] [screams] [howling] Take it! Take it! Go! Go, go! [roaring] Come on, take it! Go! Come on, you motherfucker! Come on, you motherfucker! Kill me! Come on, kill me! [screams] &lt;i&gt;Severe damage to power grid detected.&lt;/i&gt; Come on! Come on!
