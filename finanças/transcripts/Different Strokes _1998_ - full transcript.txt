no no I'm Rick Jackson thank you thank you very much you look fine you look great yourself I really thought it would be a lot more here though it's gonna get a lot hotter let me get you something all right great name so how was your play it was all right a little bumpy over Kansas with other than that nothing if you Scott just didn't take care of I used to live in New York village village I stay in the Upper West Side that's even nicer it's all right do you live alone sad girlfriend girlfriend yes you have a problem with that right No I live with my boyfriend Jack Sanders gay straight as they come you know in the past month I've um I've only spent two or three nights in my own apartment it's been great having you here and I have to worry about something breaking in uh stealing my camera stuff boy it's just it's most kind of a waste paying rent on a place I hardly even use I don't know I think it's a good idea for you to have your own place nothing else just for the security of knowing it's there it would just make more sense though if I just moved in here I mean don't you think maybe maybe at some point that's just the time David do you but you ever think there's going to be a time yeah yeah I definitely see a high probability of something like that happening in the very near future thank you jack you know I I just I just needed to hear that hey that was beginning to think that you know maybe were getting tired of me oh no they've never pictured myself with anyone with you you know I just I just started feeling a little insecure sometimes I'll have to work on them you can't have a feeling of security Wow Jack must be doing well to have a house like this afternoon well he's been being booked quite a bit lately you're lucky to get him for the Lorelai shoot I guess I am come on I can't wait to meet him you want a brick and you must be Jill Martin hello jack it's nice to finally meet you see I told you Jill people know I don't know how to dress and he checks a classic example of that sorry there's a little bit of a rush this morning oh well you know jack is an artist I guess he's got a dress the part where you moving in Joe was planning on it oh she's got all the color samples in there so instead of hanging around the lobby of the hotel waiting for check-in I thought I'd bring her straight over here we can go over the photo location so we shot the other day great I'm all up for killing two birds with one stone won't you come on in I'll make some coffee sounds great Jack you have a fabulous plate have you been here long Oh about a year has it been that long I imagine you've had some great parties these flowers are gorgeous aren't those pretty yeah - is it the location scout it shit Jill hi Jill well you two should have no trouble remembering each other's names no I'm sure there won't be any trouble Jill are you a model for a law firm in Beverly Hills Jack I'm surprised you haven't hooked her up with one of the better agencies in town well Jill is a little shy in front of the camera well if you ever change your mind and you decide to get into it I'm sure you'd be great please Joe she won't eagle model for me yeah Rick can you dig up those photos oh they're right here oh hey color samples right here looks like the variety well you never know what goes with wedding so you put them together yes do with this one this one's great Jack I think your girlfriend's adorable what can I say I have a weak spot for beautiful girls they're women Jack girls wore little dresses and play hopscotch after school you have to excuse Jack he has a tendency to be a little politically incorrect at times well then we'll just have to bring him up to date won't we Rick Touche the flowers when the white the white of the Maroons yeah I think this right here this rich color isn't that beautiful that's great about what about this the color scheme do you think it's a good match I think it's a perfect match it's like you said you don't know what goes with white until you see it all together and I think you're absolutely right about that Jill I'm not to change the subject completely about the photo shoot tomorrow a little logistics thing the idea popped in my head when I saw the lingerie since we're leaving for a location at 5:00 a.m. why don't you spend the night here instead of the hotel it'll save Rick the extra trip in the wee hours of the morning to pick you up and that way you'll already be here now you're thinking Jack he's usually not this practical well sure if it's not any trouble ah no trouble at all I'll even throw some salmon on the grill Rick you want to stay for dinner no thanks I've already made plans thank you ooh it's one o'clock doesn't the side shop close to three on Sunday you're right we'd better get our butts in gear that's great thanks where'd everybody go oh they left to get some stuff for tomorrow so do you live here too no I wish it's hard getting a man to commit sometimes isn't it look Jack it is I hope I'm not putting on personal territory I don't mean to stick my nose in where it doesn't belong but why do you stay with someone if their needs are different than yours I mean hope you don't mind me asking I was just born with this curiosity about human nature I mean some people think of it as prying I don't look at it that way what do you think what was the question I'm sorry yeah why do you stay with Jack if he doesn't want to live with you because I love him hmm says it all doesn't it Cheers I think she likes me oh no I hope so for Christ's sakes I hope she likes you she's a girlfriend not my Joe the other Jill Jill Martin I swear Jack you think every woman on this planet wants to get into your pants you think that's a bit delusional they do that I said women getting better very good very good I'm telling you I got this Joe Martin chicken Hey seen your type before they flash that feminine bullshit in your face like it's some kind of a pageant put some above and beyond the call of the wild you get him in bed sexual animals I'm not talking out of my ass here I'm speaking strictly from experience I don't think it's gonna work with this one Jack Rick did you see the way she winked am you mind you left the room that's not an engraved invitation I don't know what the hell is so what do you live to Santa Monica by the beach not pretty close about them four or five blocks wow I haven't been swimming all year well you know jack has a pool a little chilly supposed to be her face you know where the suit and a didn't toppling well you know I want to aside you kill are you there I thought you Californians went skinny-dipping all the time like that just a vicious rumor I hear howling around the alleys New York well you know some people do I take it you're not one of them oh I go skinny-dipping with Jack but I mean otherwise I usually wear a suit you know I just just in case the polder little something comes I think it's sad the way we let the fear of men ruin our lives isn't it I know how it feels we were conditioned that way I've worked very hard for many years to get over that fear that fear that keeps me from doing all the things that I love to do so much it does not feel better so I think I need to talk to Jack about that really if you want to have it done you should do it yourself are you married you know I'm living with someone though you know I used to live with somebody back when I was in college would you like it you know I think I would have liked it better if we'd actually gotten along you know I think the hardest thing about relationships with men I said they always want to be the one to control the minute a woman asserts herself and starts doing things that she wants to do oh that sweetheart business goes right out the window yeah I think I'm gonna go in now Jack's probably gonna be home soon so you might want to you know get out in a little bit but you know it's up to you you know there's um there's a showers a guest room okay thanks oh here you two top oh thanks I'll be in in a bit I'll see you then so how are things going with you and Jonathan Jonathan we have our ups and downs relationships are kind of like automobiles you find one you want to keep and you need to tune it up once in a while unlike you Jack who just drives one until you want to trade it in on a newer model of course of course don't you ever get tired of driving the same car over and over all the time not lately you know someday Jack you find a girl and she's gonna make you fall in love with her and she's gonna dump yet and you're gonna feel what it felt like all those other girls that you left and go onto greener and better fast years you said girls Rick I know I say that when our feminists around the timing cold empty here in the town thank you hey girls me Oh working tomorrow I'll be on location and I'll be here on Wednesday who's Joe just it's hard to be here you know I don't like sleeping alone you you you know when I was in college oh you need to get back to school as soon as you can all you get the hardware checks he watched a man yet your dorm 800 how people would think I'm probably getting or something for me to rest okay looking a bit worried about jack speeds how much time no no like I mean you should hear the jokes he tells about gay people and Rick's not around oh really I mean he likes Rick I mean not like a boyfriend or anything but I mean as a friend I don't know good friend shouldn't talk about each other behind their backs why Jack doesn't single out oryx pacifically you know he just he talks about the gay community in general I think I'm gonna go on dry off okay okay I'll be out of it she doing that thank you she liked it better no man in the guest room what makes sense it's a nicer bathroom is her guest from the art has good taste No then she'll just have to join in with us fuck I would never do anything like that and neither would she know because she has a boyfriend how do you think she does with a boyfriend good that for that matter come on haven't you ever thought about being with another girl I might have wondered about it a couple times but it there there's a lot of things that I think about that I never want to do like what for instance Chuck why do you always have to ask me these kind of things because I wanna get to know you better especially if you're gonna move in with me someday Wow once I move in with you then maybe I'll tell you okay but for now I'm gonna keep it my little secret thank you it's not there's this great opportunity if he'd ever thought about it we had this attractive woman staying with us tonight maybe tomorrow night and then she's gone back to New York and you know we'd ever thought about being another girl here's this golden opportunity just staring you right in the face I might even bring us closer together Jack just forget it okay okay I'm saying is we should be open to new experiences that's all I'm saying okay okay and - go ahead - charcoal why don't you uh pop one of those Waldorf salad Ziggy - yeah yeah exact you're the best didn't I tell you he was a good cook yeah dinner was great and that Waldorf salad was delicious yeah thanks Jill you're gonna be comfortable in the guest room oh yeah the rooms fine thanks in that case I think we should all get to bed a little extra early tonight but Jack it's only 9 o'clock I know but Jill and I have to be up and out of here by 5:00 a.m. so I haven't gone to bed at nine o'clock since I can't even remember can we play cards or something I really think we should all hit the sack you know I think I'm just gonna hang out here for a while and enjoy the fire oh good night then good night sleep well you two to fight see in the morning so this is why you wanted to go to bed early the better reason no big day tomorrow I gotta get some sleep have you called after your the tone thank you wait for the tone Eric you you gentlemen that's a wrap yeah you have did a fabulous job thank you very much great job you guys how long before we hit the road what do you think correct 10 15 minutes 15 tops okay I'm gonna go to the short walk clear my head before we leave just yell when you need me Jill yeah I'm not usually one to hand out compliments but I'm really impressed with the way you handle the shoot today you have a very special talent for making the girl to
