Hey, you need to tell your sister to slow the hell down! The engine isn't gonna take this much longer! You know Gwenn doesn't listen to me! Yeah? Well, she sure as hell doesn't listen to us either. Dana, it's no joke! She needs to slow down! I'll let her know! Gwenn, you need to ease off. This goddamn engine isn't... They're not getting away from us this time. Here. It's, uh... it's ready. You only got one shot at this, okay? So make it count. You're sure this tracking device contraption of yours, it's... it's gonna grab on to their ship? It should. I think. Hey, we're gonna lose them in the fog if the two of you don't hurry up. Hey. She's sick again. Staying topside is the only thing that seems to help. Get her to the stern so she can see the horizon. No. No, no, no. What's going on? Why are we stopping? Just get her to the stern! Come on. Hit the deck! Are they shooting at us? Get away from the window! She did it. We're tracking them. We finally got the bastards. Ten tons of illegal fish and a video of those assholes shooting at us. That's prison for sure, right? First we've got to catch up to them, stop them before they unload. Any idea how we're gonna do that? Rusty? How's it looking down there? Thought we had a deal, Gwenn. I agree to fix her. You agreed not to break her. I thought we were here to do whatever it takes. Takes an engine is what it takes, Gwenn. You do know how a ship works, right? - Just tell me when... - Need a hand here. Do you know what the problem is? We just make it look too damn easy. Hell, yeah. I think it's over. I need to sit down for a minute. Getting shot at... not what I signed up for. Tell me this doesn't happen all the time. Don't ask me. This is my first time out. Are you guys all right? We're not shot, if that's what you mean. They're gonna pay for that, I promise! Dana, is everything okay? Ugh. This is gonna be a long three months. You okay? I never should have gotten on this ship. What was I thinking? Aren't you, like, their fish expert or something? Ichthyologist. Love fish. Hate the water. I know. The irony of it all isn't lost on me. I'm a lab rat, but my university makes me come out once every three years for my accreditation. Must really love what you do. Right now, not so much. So... what brings you to the middle of the North Pacific? Um... I'm a med student. Well, I was. Um, actually... it's kind of a long story. Did you see that? See what? There. We're on it. I know. I'm just trying to keep Gwenn out of your hair. Hey, Gwenn, it's Dana. We'll have an estimate on the engine in... One hour. Two hours. Listen, I need everyone on the bridge. It's important. That's a hell of a storm. Over 100 miles wide. And growing. And we're directly in its path. Getting shot at, no engine... this just keeps getting better. You know what happens if we hit that storm with no engine. Well aware, Rusty. - What happens? - Without the engine, we can't turn into the waves. If we can't turn into the waves... We capsize. How long do we have? At its current rate, I'd say just under three hours. There's... there's something in the water. Was it a boat you saw? It looked like... like someone was trying to hold on to something in the water. It was hard to make out. But you're sure you saw someone. It was nearly dark, but... I don't... Michelle? Did you see anything out there? Um... I'm not sure. Look, I'm sorry, but I think we're wasting our time here. It's not like we don't have enough to deal with as it is. I'm with Rusty. It's not like there was a distress call or anything, right? I mean, where would they have come from? What about the Chinese trawler? Someone could have fallen overboard in the chaos. And they don't circle back to get them? Look, I know I saw something, all right? If it is a person, we can't just leave them out there. You're right. She's right. So how's this? Uh, me, Erika, and Michelle, we take the lifeboat out; We have a look. Everyone else focuses on getting the engine fixed. We come back the instant you're up and running whether we find something or not. If you go out in this, you're never gonna find your way back. Keep the searchlight on. Make sure it's always in sight. We have to know. Right? Hello? Is anyone out there? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? Here's the hose. Kat, the hose. - What if this doesn't work? - It will work. Yeah, but what if it doesn't? Kat, I need you to focus. There's no engine we can't fix, am I right? Am I right? You're right. Okay. Now, let's get this done. Hello? Hello? Is there anyone out there? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Thought you hated the water. Yeah, don't remind me. Hello! Can anyone hear me? Hey, do you hear that? They got the engine going. So we should be heading back, right? Like you said. We haven't been looking for that long. I'm sure we can spare a few more minutes. Right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just stay calm. I'm sure they'll have it powered up any... Michelle! Michelle! - Michelle? - Michelle! Michelle! Michelle! See if you can find a bigger clamp. Rusty? What the hell happened? You happened, Gwenn. Remember? We're just trying to fix it with what little we've got, okay? - What about the generator? - Its pump to the main fuel line is shot. We told Gwenn already. Look, without that searchlight, Dana's not gonna have a hope in hell of finding her way back here. We hear you, but one problem at a time, all right? Oh, found one. Here. - Michelle? - Michelle! - Where is she? - Michelle? Michelle! Michelle! Where are you? Michelle! Michelle! - Come on! Grab hold! - Take my hand! - Come on! - Pull! - Pull! Oh, my God! I don't think... I'm a big fan of the water either. The power's back on. They got the engine going. Is he alive? - This guy sure as hell didn't fall off a fishing trawler. I'm surprised he's still alive, considering how cold that water is. You got that right. Okay, we're gonna need your help. Uh... Okay. Come on, girl. You can do it. Um, I need the defib paddles. It's in the cabinet, over there. Can someone get a knife or scissors? How long could someone survive in water that cold? 15 minutes. Maybe 30, tops. - S-so this guy should be dead. Yeah, he's going to be if you guys don't hurry. Here! Sir, you need to sit back. - Let go! - Please... please let go. Sir, you... you need to let her go so we can help you, okay? We're just trying to help! Calm down, sir! No one is trying to hurt you, okay? - Oh, God. - Are you okay? - Fine. I'm fine. Help Rusty! Okay. Let me take that. I'm getting the rifle, and then I'm gonna go find him. - A-alone? We'll all go. We'll take this deck if you want to look topside. Okay. - Here, take this. - There are bigger knives in the mess hall! Rusty? What just happened here? I don't know. Dana, wait up. N-no. No, no, no. No, my knife. No. Come on. Dana? Dana, where'd you go? Dana, please. Dana? - You need to stay close, okay? - O-okay. Hey! Hey, stop! Gwenn. Gwenn! Wait! Hey, asshole. Did... did you... What choice did I have, right? We need... we need some help on the bridge! Now! He stabbed Gwenn! - I-I'm gonna get the first-aid kit. It's under the sink, over there. That psycho attacked her! We need to do something! We don't need to worry about him any more. What? She, um... She killed him. What? Did to him what he was gonna do to us. What, we should have waited until he killed one of us first? This is going to hurt. You should set the autopilot. We need to call the Coast Guard. Yeah, like hell we do. There is a dead man on your ship. What are you gonna do, just throw him overboard and pretend none of this happened? Look, I did what had to be done. Will the both of you just stop? Okay? Let's get clear of this storm, and then we can decide what's best to do. A few hours, it's not gonna make a difference. Now, we need to get that body inside before we hit any weather. You guys? What... what is it? He... he's, uh... What? He's gone. I thought you said... Well, he sure as hell looked dead to me. Kill me. What? When he grabbed me earlier in the sick bay... I-I think he said, "Kill me. "Kill yourselves. End this." I thought the engine was fixed. It was fixed. That man's still out there somewhere. Lock those doors. Generator's kicked on. Turn that off. Okay, everyone just... take a breath. Take a breath? Did you not hear what he said to her? He was probably in shock. Delusional. Who knows what being in the water that long did to him? Well, it sure as hell didn't kill him like it should have, right? Right? Be careful with that, Kat. No, he shouldn't have survived that. - What about the 12-inch blade Rusty buried in his stomach? Should he have been able to survive that? He crawled off somewhere, okay? He crawled off and died. No one can survive an injury like that. That's my point, Rusty. He should not have survived in the first place. She's right. How do you explain that? Look, he's either dead, or he's not, but none of that matters if we don't get the damn engine fixed. That storm is gonna be on us within the hour. Without the engine, we all know what that means. Even if we call for help, no one would ever get to us in time. Looks like it's up to you and me. Like that's something new. Sparks and I will come give you a hand. We will? Hey. You guys go ahead. I'm right behind you. Where are you going? I need to find out where our friend went. Shouldn't we all stick together? We'll work a lot faster if we're not constantly looking over our shoulder. I won't be long. Dana, wait. If he's not dead... you'll finish him, right? Get the engine fixed. Genny's gonna need gas. God damn it. Perfect. Just perfect. What the hell is going on down there? Generator's out of gas. We're on it. I'll get the gas. I need a little light over here. All right. We're gonna get through this, right? Yeah. You know why? 'Cause we're just too damn good. Damn right we are. Sparks? Sparks! Sparks? This is no time for jokes. What the hell happened? Why would someone do this? We'll never get this fixed in time. We'll never get this fixed in time. What are we gonna do? He's here! He's... he's in here somewhere. What? Oh, God. What happened here? We're in serious trouble. Where's Sparks? I don't know. She was just here. Sparks? Sparks? Are you in here? Sparks. What is it? - Oh, God. Sparks. What happened? I don't know. She's hurt. Let her go! - Get him off! I think he's dead. I think so too. From here on in, I don't think anyone should be touching him. What do you mean, we shouldn't be touching him? We've all touched him. See this? Was that there before? Um... we never had a chance to look that closely. Dana, she just said not to touch him. Well, that's not good. There's nothing we can do about this now. We need to focus on getting the engine fixed. Kat, what the hell are you doing? I'm getting off the ship! You should all do the same! Don't be stupid, Kat! Go the other way! Cut her off! Oh, God. Kat. You need to stop, okay? You're not thinking this through. I'm getting off this ship, Rusty, with or without you. And go where? She's right, Kat. Closest land is over 600 miles away. You'd run out of gas long before then. I guess I'll have to take my chances. You really think you're gonna make it out there in this? If you care so much, help me with the bigger boat. In either boat, you're gonna end up in the water. Then you're done for. That's a guarantee. If we stay on this ship, we're all done for. Can't you all see that? I mean, who knows what that guy had? For all we know... we have it now too. Kat... the only hope in hell we have of surviving this is if we get that engine going again. I'll never be able to do it without you. You don't really think that mess down there can be fixed, right? It can. If you help me, it can. Just stay back, all right? Going out there is a death sentence. But if that's what you want... and you want to leave us out here to fend for ourselves, then we're not gonna stop you. I'm... I just... I don't want to die, okay? Not out here. Not like this. Then I suggest we all get busy. That is, if we're done with the theatrics. Sparks? You head up to the radio room. We're gonna send that mayday, okay? I'll try and steer us into the waves. Maybe buy us some time. I'll come help you. - Okay. - You guys go with Rusty. She's gonna need all the hands she can get. I'm... I'm sorry. I can't go back in there. Not until that body's gone. Well, does anyone have a problem now with throwing him overboard? Actually, that's the last thing we should be doing. Well, I've had just about enough of your holier-than-thou, self-righteous bullshit. He was sick, right? And we've all come in contact with him. If he is contagious, we need to know with what before we all end up like him. Is that something you can do? Michelle can do an autopsy. I'll assist her. Wait, what? I'm not qualified to do that. I barely got through half of med school. I can't. You're gonna be okay to do this, right? Uh... You don't understand. Uh... I-I really don't do well in... in stressful situations. That's why I-I washed out of med school. We're gonna take it slow. One step at a time. Okay? One step at a time. Pull away his shirt. I'm gonna collect some data, okay? Okay. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. We're broken down in the path of a Category 3 storm at 2-5 degrees 3-2.9 minutes north, 1-4-2 degrees 4-4.9 minutes east. Again, we are requesting immediate assistance. I'm telling you, there's no one out there. No one was stupid enough to hang around in the path of this storm. Just keep trying, okay? Mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. Does anyone copy? Mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. - You doing okay? I think so. The ballasts are full now, so it should stabilize us. At least for a while. No, I mean... I mean, are you doing okay? Mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. We're broken down in the path of a Category 3 storm. You mean, uh... am I doing okay with the fact that... if it wasn't for me, we wouldn't be in this mess? Am I doing okay with being the one responsible for possibly getting us all killed? No one is blaming you. I'm blaming me. This is my ship. It's my responsibility, and, uh... I pushed... I pushed too hard this time. No one could have known what was gonna happen when we let that man on board. We did what was right. Dad would have done the same thing. When did, uh, my little sister get so grown up? I had to grow up. I had to look after you. Dana, this is Michelle. We got something down here you guys might want to have a look at. Go. I've got this. I'll be right there. Mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. We're broken down in the path of a Category 3 storm. Does anyone copy? You really think that's necessary? I've had enough surprises for one day, thank you. Anybody tries to open one of these doors, I want to know about it. Do you think you're ready to get to work now? You think you've really got a way to fix that damn thing? You doing okay? I think so. Uh... uh, it's at the... at the bottom of the door. We found it in his pants pocket. I doubt this will power on, but... maybe Sparks can get something off the SIM card. The other one is just Sparks' video camera. We found it on the floor in here. Maybe there's something of use on it. Uh, I-I'd wear gloves if you're gonna be handling either one of them, just to be safe. Did you guys find anything yet? Ugh. Uh... I should get back. Let us know as soon as you find something, okay? Okay. How many more do you need for the biopsy? This should do it. - Can you reach it? - I think so. Rusty, you hear that? It's just the rudder shaft sending vibrations through the hull. Got it. Rusty, you there? Rusty? Rusty, you still in here? Rusty? Mayday. Mayday, mayday. This is the "Amphitrite" requesting immediate assistance. Is there anyone out there? Mayday. Mayday, mayday. The SAT phone was in his pocket. You think we can get anything off the SIM card? - I-if it's not too damaged, yeah. Hey, give me a hand here. Michelle said to put gloves on before touching it. Copy that. Each cluster is proportionally the same, but each new cluster is slightly larger than the previous. An infection or disease wouldn't spread like that. No, it wouldn't. What do you think it is? I was hoping you'd be able to tell me. Face your fears, right? You've got this. Let's get this over with. Everything except the heart is atrophied. That's not possible. Don't stop now. Almost there. Just breathe, okay? Here. Come on! There. What is that? I can't breathe. Michelle, you need to leave your mask on! I can't breathe. Michelle! Leave your mask on! No! No! Leave it on, Michelle! Oh, God, get it off! - Michelle, go! What the hell is that? Rusty, can you guys top off the generator? Looks like she's almost out. Rusty? Kat? Do you copy? Oh, son of a bitch. Rusty? Kat? You guys in here? Rusty. Kat. Rusty! Kat! Hey, Gwenn? It's Dana. Uh, Rusty and Kat aren't down here. Are... are they on the bridge? Gwenn, are you there? Don't move. I said don't move. Gwenn, you don't need to do this. She should have said something. Gwenn, please. What the hell is going on? She's got the spots on her arm and she didn't bother to tell anyone. She's been walking around this whole time and hasn't said a thing. Is that true? I... Go ahead. Show her. I said show her. All right. All right. I feel fine. You have got a damn disease. You are not fine. Everyone just stop, all right? Just stop. Get the hell out of the way, Erika. It's not a disease. It's not a disease. I think... I think it's a bite mark. A bite mark? From what? I don't know. But something was feeding on that man's body, and as it grew, its bite marks got larger. The three spots? It got larger. It must have tried moving on to Sparks as a new food source, but Dana scared it off in the engine room before it could finish attaching or bond itself. This... is bullshit. That man was sick, plain and simple. Now Sparks has probably infected the rest of us. We saw it, all right? We saw it inside the man when we cut him open. It looked like... like it was trying to keep him alive. I think that's how he survived in the water. It was keeping him alive long enough to find another food source. You mean us? At the rate it's growing, it would need a warm-blooded food source. Not the easiest thing to find in the middle of the ocean. Dana... are you believing any of this? The... the thing you saw... you can show us, right? It's dead. It's gone. Of course it is. It... it crawled out of the man's mouth, and then it just... I-I don't know, it... it just melted. So whatever it was, it's dead now, right? So there's nothing to worry about. Right? What was inside that man's body... It was too small to have made the bite marks. Kat and Rusty, they weren't in the engine room. Rusty? Kat? Is that you? - Jesus. Get... it... off. We... we have to get it off of her! - Don't touch it! Don't let it get away! We can seal it with this. Michelle? How's she doing? She's breathing. But I have no idea what kind of internal damage it may have done. What if it put one of those things inside of her... like you found on that man? I don't know. Could be what's keeping her alive. I've got something. Okay, um... the last call he made was four days ago. The coordinates were put in here. That's right in the middle of the Mariana Trench. What the hell was he doing there? The Mariana Trench? The world's deepest part of the ocean. 36,000 feet down. You could sink Mount Everest in there and the peak would still be a good mile underwater. - Uh, I-I recovered fragments of a video that he tried to upload from his phone. Are... are those core samples? They can't be. The trench is a protected monument. - Wait, s-stop there. Go back a little. Stop. Tamor Oil and Gas. Son of a bitch. What is it? They're looking for oil. But that's illegal. Some genius in the U.S. government has been talking about allowing drilling in the trench. Looks like these guys were secretly trying to get a jump-start on the competition. Okay, that still doesn't explain what happened to that man. Or how he ended up in the ocean 200 miles from there. No one's ever dug that deep. And there sure as hell isn't any warm-blooded food source anywhere near that depth it could have fed on. They're messing with the unknown down there. Who knows what kind of microbe they brought up? Something desperate to live. That's for sure. Uh, I downloaded this off my camera. Watch the side of his neck. Whatever it is, it's... it's a lot bigger now. If we see that thing again, we need to stay away from the smaller tentacles. I think it uses them like a jellyfish to render its victim unconscious. That's probably why you don't remember being attacked. That's a nice thought. This is useless without the engine. The ocean's just throwing us around now. We need to find Kat. Find out how close they were to getting the engine going. We can't just ride out the storm in here? If we can't turn the bow into the waves, we're... we're eventually gonna capsize. But there's a chance we won't, right? A chance we'll make it through. All it will take is one rogue wave, and that wave will come. But for all we know, Kat could be dead already. Food for that... thing out there. We all better hope that Kat is alive, because... without Rusty, she's our only shot. Look, you all do what you want, but I'm not going, all right? I'll... I'll stay here and look after Rusty. There's nothing more you can do for Rusty. We need you with us... in case Kat is injured. I'm sorry. I'm not... I'm just not going. All right? If we do nothing, we're all dead for sure. I'll go. We don't have much of a choice here. We got to face our fears, right? The flares are in the lifeboat locker. Come on. Um, we should probably get some supplies from the sick bay, right? Just in case. You know how to use one of these? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. It's locked. - Is everything all right? - All good! Kat? Kat? Michelle. Come on. I'm sorry. I-I just can't. Michelle! What's going on? You guys go! I'll meet you at sick bay! - What are you doing? - I'm getting Michelle! Go! Dana! Michelle! Come on, Michelle! Get it off! Get it off me! No! - Michelle! Get it off! Michelle! Michelle! Michelle! Hell of a way to go. - I got the morphine. - Good. We need to go! We need to get to the engine room now! Dana? We need to find Kat. We need to get to the engine room... now! Where... where's Michelle? She... she's dead. Dead? How? I don't... Move! What are you doing? - Move! What? Go! Get out of here! Go! Dana! The hinges are rusted! I'll give you a hand. I know I left this open. It's jammed or something. Just pull! The engine room door won't open! - We'll be right there. We're in! We're in! - No! - You live through this, you hear me? No! No! No! Dana! Dana, you are not dying because of me. Now go! No! No! No! No! Dana, Dana, Dana. No, we can't just leave her! No! Get away from the door... now. It was you. You... you were holding down the latches. You were trying to keep us out. Get away from the door... now. You are not letting that thing back in here. Do you hear me? Coward. Better than being a dead hero. - Dana! Stop it! Stop, Kat. Stop! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop, all right? Dana! Dana! Get off her, Dana! - Stop it, you guys! Stop! Just stop! All right, stop! It's bad enough we need to worry about that thing out there. Now we need to worry about each other? Why? Why? Why would you do that? Don't you dare judge me. You have no idea what I've lived through down here just to get this thing fixed. I wasn't about to let it all be for nothing. You've been working on this the entire time? Rusty and I just... just started working on it when I heard her scream. I went looking for her. Next thing I know, I'm waking up behind the gearbox. Rusty, she... she's next to me. That thing is already on her. Feeding on her or something. When you came in to... to check the generator... I wanted to say something, you know? Cry out for help. But I was so worried that... That thing would turn on me. Rusty... she managed to get back on her feet, if you can believe it. She followed you right out of here. She was always stronger than me. So you waited for her to leave and... you locked yourself in? You're damn right I did. And any one of you would have done exactly the same thing. You said the engine is fixed. Close. I just need to reroute the fuel line. That's great. We're gonna get out of here. We're gonna get through this. There's a catch. It'll need to be started from the bridge. The electrical is shot to hell down here. I had to bypass it. How long do you need? With an extra set of hands, 15, 20 minutes, tops. I'll do it. I'll start it from the bridge. But first... what do you think is gonna kill that thing? Electricity. It might do the trick. Kat? Where is it? It's in the cabinet with the wrenches. I've got some wire. Bingo. All right. This'll work? Oh, it'll work. Whether it'll kill that thing is a different question. You won't be able to fire it, so you'll need to get close enough to stab it. Don't turn it on till right before you need it, or you'll drain the unit. And obviously, once it's on... Clear. You'll want to make sure you don't touch the spear. Okay. Ten minutes. We'll be ready. Don't you worry about us. You guys just get to the bridge. Gwenn! - Dana, wait! - Gwenn! Gwenn! Wait! Gwenn! Dana! Dana, wait! Wait up! Gwenn! She's heading for the bridge! Come on! - Dana! - Are you all right? I'm fine. Gwenn! She's alive! She's headed to the bridge! - Oof! - Gwenn? Gwenn? Gwenn? Gwenn, are you in here? Gwenn? Gwenn! Hang in there. Okay. We need to get the engine started. Make sure the bow thrusters are engaged. Good to go. Come on, Kat. Come on. Call the engine room and find out what the hell is going on! Sparks! Sparks! Come on. Start, you son of a bitch! Yes! Yes! We did it! We did it, Sparks! I'll be right there. I'm just gonna... set the autopilot. I'm coming, okay? We're going home. Let me... Gwenn, no. It... must... die. - N-no! No! No! Gwenn! She did... did it. She saved us. Sparks? What did you do? Sparks! Help, Dana! Help me! Sparks! - Get it off! - Sparks! Help me! Get it off! - What are you doing? - Killing this son of a bitch once and for all. No! Just let the storm take it! It's gonna die here and now! We don't even know if it's gonna work! Sparks! - No, no! - Sparks! No! Sparks! Go! Get out of here! - No! - No! Sparks! Is this it? It'll do. Dana? Is that you? Where is Sparks? Gwenn too. I'm so sorry. Were you able to set the autopilot? Yeah, I... I set it for Guam. - But, um... we can't let that happen. We can't let what happen? There's no killing that thing out there. That man tried to destroy the engine. He... he knew what he was doing. He was trying to... stop that thing from spreading. He was trying to stop... stop it from getting to anyone else. You're not suggesting that we... That we let the ship sink. With that thing and us on it. That's crazy. That's suicide. Tell her. Tell her it's crazy. You've seen what that thing is capable of. Do we really want to be the ones responsible for unleashing that onto the rest of the world? Our friends? Our families? Who says it's not gonna find something else to feed on out there? Whales, seals. They're warm-blooded, right? We would have died for nothing. There's a greater chance it'll starve and die if it goes down with us. Listen, all I know is, I'm going home. I have a life, plans, and I'm sure as hell not dying out here in the middle of the goddamn ocean. Just because you have no one left does not mean you can sacrifice the rest of us. I'm sorry, Kat. I really am, but we have to do this. - No! - Wait, no! - Kat. - Let it go! - Stop it! - I'm not dying here! Stop it! Kat! - Don't make me do this. There has to be another option. - Maybe there's a way to... to kill it you haven't thought of yet. We can't take the chance! No! I'm sorry. - Run. - No! No! You should have finished what you started, asshole! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
