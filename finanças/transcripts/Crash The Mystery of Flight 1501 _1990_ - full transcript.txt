[uplifting music] * [radio chatter] [radio chatter] The white zone is for loading and unloading passengers only. No parking. Hand me my bag! Wait a minute! Greg! Greg. God you are relentless, you know that? Once you get onto something you never let it go. Well I thought this was important to both of us! You know damn well it is. You don't sound that way. What are we doing to each other, Di? Haven't we been through enough already? Look, do you want to give up? Do you want to give up? If you want to give up just tell me. And then what? I don't know. I'll try to - I don't know! I'm human, okay? I have my doubts, it doesn't mean I'm not committed! Well I'm sorry! I have my doubts too, and maybe I'm just paranoid, I don't know, it's just when you want something so much - But you are not alone in this, Diane! It's the two of us, you and me. Fine. Fine! Maybe I'm just crazy, okay? Fine. I'll tell you something. One of the best days I can remember is when you came to me and said 'Greg, I'm ready to try again.' Really? Yes, really, so don't put me through this! I don't know why you put up with me. Yes you do. Hey! Be careful up there! Always! You know that. See you. Attention please. ConWest Airlines flight 2412, Phoenix, is now arriving at gate 16. This way please, this way. [background chatter] [dogs barking] Start valve lights. Out. Electrical system. Is, uh... Check. This is the final boarding call for ConWest Airlines flight 1501 now boarding at Gate 19. I can't believe this. Okay, honey, you're right over here. Okay. Good afternoon, Senator. Hi Senator, my names Lorraine. Can I get you something to drink? Oh, maybe just some coffee, hm? - And you, sir? - No thanks. External power APU ignition is off, gear lights. Down three green. Hydraulics. We got a low pressure light here. The pumps not putting out. Damn. We can go without it. I know. Getting all over us about delays. Got two backups. Yeah, but I don't like it. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Greg Halstead, I'm your captain. On behalf of ConWest Airlines I'd like to welcome you aboard flight 1501 to Kansas City and then on to San Francisco. There's an indication here on one of our hydraulic pumps that I don't like. We're allowed to go with it, but, uh, I'd prefer not to. And so in the interest of safety we are gonna be delayed here an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I hope you understand this is all in our best interests, we will keep you posted to any progress. In the meantime, thank you and uh, we appreciate you flying ConWest. Sorry Senator. An hour and a half, I don't know. I've got to be in Kansas City by 8 o'clock tonight. Got to be! Well, there's that United flight in half an hour. Of course, we may have to bump somebody. Well, what are we gonna do? Got to be there. Maybe next time, sorry. - Uh, sir? -Yes? - Our name is Switzer. - Yes, Mr. Switzer. The missus and me got this bargain flight to Honolulu, are we gonna miss it? We've been planning this trip for years. What's your layover time? In San Francisco? only about two hours. Well, you should be alright. We'll see what it looks like when we get to Kansas City. Uhm... I guess. Well, now, don't you worry, one way or another we'll get you to Honolulu. [phone ringing] Hi, this is Diane, and yes, this is a recording. Now don't hang up, Greg and I are out runnin' around someplace but we'd still like to hear from ya, so don't be shy! Talk as long as you'd like, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks! Hi Di, it's me, if you're there pick up the phone. Damn. Really didn't want to miss you. Um... We've got a delay here before we take off and I just wanted to talk to you, sort of explain to you what I'm going through. In the first place, I'm sorry. Just bear with me about this pregnancy thing, will you? Oh, great, he's playing with my airplanes again. - It's mine! - No it's not! - Yes it is! - Give it back! - No! - Hey come on! Hey, kids, that's enough of that! Make him give me back my plane! - It's mine! - Is not! Is too, stupid! Kids, I told you what would happen if this happened again, now in the house! Hi. They had nothing else to play with. I'll get this. Did Greg get off okay? Yes, as far as I know. You're ruining my life! That's what mothers are for, honey. You can have these two. Oh, Diane, I'm sorry. It's not what I meant to say. Dixie, it's been seven years, you can stop walking on eggs now, okay? Come on! * 1620, have you hold at runway 3-5 right, ConWest 1501, you're cleared for takeoff on runway 3-5 left, wind 0-1-0 at 1-3 altimeter - two niner point niner . - 1501 is on the roll. * [protestors chanting] There he is! Senator, hi, I'm Ted Wilbeck, welcome to Kansas City. Thank you Mr. Wilbeck, it's good to be here. First thing that's gone right all day. Our flight was held up, then we missed the United flight and I had to charter a jet! Taxpayers are gonna love that. I misunderstood, we thought maybe you had took that bomb threat seriously. Bomb threat?? Well, that's what they said, I don't know Senator. Maybe someone doesn't like your attitudes about abortions. Well there's nothing new about that. Wait a minute. No one told you? We got a call at the conference headquarters here, that said you'd never made it to Kansas City and that when you switched planes, well, we assumed that -- Did you follow up on it? We assumed that your staff did. Did you warn the airline? Did anybody? You mean ConWest? No, you weren't on that flight. Mr. Wilbeck, the bomber if there is one, doesn't know that. [beeping] This is ConWest 1501 answering cell call. Roger 1501 we have dispatch on the frequency, go ahead. Dispatch this is 1501. Roger, captain. We have just received a bomb threat regarding your plane. Say again? You have a possible bomb on board. Can you verify that it's on 1501? Negative. It's up to you, Skipper. Okay. Right then. Keep us informed. Roger. So what do you think? Cleveland Center this is ConWest 1501 we have just received word of a bomb threat - nearest major airport. Go ahead 1501. I request expeditious clearance to... - I'd say Dayton. - Dayton. How does that look to you, Center? Our radar shows a solid line of thunderstorms, you're gonna have to pick your way around them. Choice of Dayton airport or Monitor Municipal. Monitors as good as any, then. So what do we tell the passengers? [sighs] Well odds are its a hoax, right? No sense sending some poor soul into cardiac arrest over nothing. This is captain Halstead, I've just punched on the fasten seatbelt sign, there's rain showers ahead and reports of some turbulence. We can't fly over this stuff, but rather than return to Washington, I've elected to set us down in Dayton until this activity abates. I know this causes further delay but under the circumstances it is the safest thing to do. So flight attendants, please prepare cabin for landing. Thank you. Oh, no... Approach Control, this is ConWest 1501 descending to 3,000 proceeding direct to the Monitor Airport. We are facing some fairly heavy storm cells between here and the airport. If you can, request radar vectors around the activity. Cells are building rapidly in all quadrants. Looks like the softest spot might be um... Turn right heading 0-3-5, uh... - [thunder crashes] - and maintain three thousand. Over. Wait a minute, that puts us right into a big one. We show that to be about the best heading for you sir. [thunder crashing] Oh, my god! Doesn't look that good to us. We're gonna maintain present heading 1-8-0. According to our radar that puts you right in the middle of the largest cell. [thunder crashes] Well, I'm gonna have to go by what we see here. Seems to be the best way to get through this stuff. Not according to our radar, but uh, you're the captain. Maintain heading 1-8-0, you're clear to land on runway 1-8. [thunder, lightning striking] Flap 15 landing gear down. [pounding, pulsing music] Something's wrong here. I don't like the looks of this. Flight attendants take your seats now. [nervous chatter] [children crying] Oh my god! Oh, no! What is it? Something's screwy here. - How's 1501 look to you? - What's he doing? Big front blowing in from the east and he's flying - right into it. - Not according to his radar. That the guy with the bomb? Right, he's coming in on 1 8. Damn. I'm gonna scramble crash trucks. Oh, boy. 1501, we're now sure you're in the worst of it. Oh my god! It's okay, we'll be on the ground in a minute. Damn, where did this thing come from? Come on, it's - boy its a rough one. Scramble crash equipment to runway 18, scramble crash equipment to runway 18. [sirens blaring] [warning sounds] We've lost number 2 engine! Damn, too much water! Maybe not! Try an air start! [people screaming in fear] Pull up, pull up, pull up. 1501? pull up, pull up, pull up. We've-got-no...! 1501? 1501? 1501? 1501? 1501? [plane exploding] I got a crash on the airport, runway is closed, airport is closed, airport is closed. All aircraft on this frequency stand by. We have an emergency, you will be directed to another airport, this airport's closed. [fire crackling, sirens wailing] Look at this. Especially the overhead bins, melting, dropping onto the passengers. The plastic trims putting out, what? Well, smoke, ammonia, cyanide, all kinds of lethal gases. This stuff is killing people! Wes Goddard here. Yeah. Where? ConWest Air? Pam and Bob are with me now, notify the rest of the go team will ya? Right, bye. We've got a DC 9 down, Dayton Ohio. We're on our way. Where do you think you're going? Home to bed and don't try to stop me. I wouldn't dream of it. They've got beds in Dayton. Dayton, what does Dayton have to do with -- We've got a plane down, 100 fatalities, maybe more, the news director wants you on the air in five minutes for a special news bulletin. I need everything we know and quick, and keep the information coming. I want to leave for the crash site as soon as we finish here. Have our satellite feed set up and hot by the time we get there, and tell em to make sure the wreckage is in the background. And lighted! I can't believe I forgot Greg told me that spare was flat. Listen, if I say something you won't get mad at me? No! Why? You're such a private person in some ways. Dixie, come on! What does Greg have to say about all this? Oh, he just bawled me out for not believing in him. I guess we are both still a little sensitive about... Well you know when Mary Anne died, you have no idea what we went through together. But that's the point, we went through it together. You've had, what? Two miscarriages? And then this perfectly beautiful little girl that -- You can say it, you know... Crib death. Do you have any idea what the, what the odds are against two consecutive crib deaths? I'd just never forgive myself if I didn't try again. I'm ready, I'm ready emotionally, I... I really want to have another child. Is this the same Diane Halstead who swore to me that she was through with all that? Well like you said that was seven years ago, I... Time changes things. Would be fun. Oh my god. Oh my god. - Is he dead? - Diane! Is he dead or alive just tell me! The only information we have is that the plane went down outside of Dayton. No no, he was going to Kansas City. They had to divert, some kind of bomb threat, Diane I'm sorry. I have to... I have to see him, I have to go there! We'll get you there! [people yelling, fire crackling, sirens blaring] [directions, orders being yelled] Hey! Air Force is here! You gotta move it! Put out the fuselage I gotta get in there! We gotta see what's in there, let's go, come on! Lieutenant, you alright? No I'm not, I need more portable lights set up over here, over here, here, and one back by the tail section, back there, the command post is fine where it is. Let's go get it set up here! God almighty! Come on! Lieutenant what can we do for you? Well I need a staging area set up here. There's gonna be a lot of vehicular traffic coming through. Somebody check credentials! Sir, we can handle that. A hospital, anybody heard from them? They're coming in now. Alright we gotta clear a path to the ambulance. Right, what about the news people? Ah, to hell with the news. Excuse me whose the on scene commander? I am for now anyway. What can I do for you? Special agent Bryce, FBI, we were told there was a bomb threat involved. That's right. We're gonna have to secure the area then. Well wait a minute here. Who are those people over there? What the hell are they doing? CIA. Something about top secret cargo, that's all I know. Mueller, get into that. I don't want anything removed until we've completed our investigation. Christ, we're looking for survivors here. I understand, but this is a possible crime scene and all this could be evidence. Look if it's a matter of jurisdiction -- No, no, rescue operations come first, of course, let's just try to stay out of each others way, that's all. [men yelling directions] Children! There's children, they, they were... Where'd you come from? Um, sir, excuse me, what are you doing here? I've looked everywhere! Sir you don't understand this is a secured area, you're not supposed to - wait a minute, were you on the plane? Plane? No, no, my shoe, my other shoe. We got a survivor here! Sir, if you come along with me. Without my shoe? Uh huh, this way. There seemed to be two factors. One is a bomb threat, and the other - this isn't at all clear yet. Are we on? Excuse me I learned that we just have picture. Um. As I was saying there was something about thunderstorms and confusion in the cockpit of the plane. I'm not sure what that means, I'll have to trace that down. As to survivors, only one is confirmed at this point. - Nickerson? - Yeah? - It's Chet, you got the TV on? - No, why? A plane just went down in Dayton. No kidding. We're talking a hundred and thirty people, and I want you to fly in there ASAP and I don't care what it takes just get down there and start digging around. - Any survivors? - So far only one. Okay I'll start with the hospital. You coming with me? No, no, I'll drive down tomorrow. You go ahead and get started without me. - This could be a big one right? - Yeah, I know. Hey! Hey there's somebody in there! Alive?? Don't know! Who is it, can you tell? Can't get at him, he's got a uniform though! Hydraulic pump, bring him in here let's go! I need a torch right away, get it in here. [somber music] - Mrs. Halstead? - Yes. Hi, I'm Marge Vale. Did you get the word? No, nothing. Why, what is it? Well we don't know much, except your husband's alive. - Alive? - Yes. Are you alright? Yes, it was just... It was the not knowing. - How, how bad is it? - I have no idea. Can I see him? - Howard! - Wes! - Good to see you. - This is everybody? No, no, no, more on the way. Howard, you don't know these folks. - Pam Hayes, survival factors, - Hi. Bob Stanton, hazardous materials division. And of course there's this poor soul. Scott Cody, Howard, how you doing? Howard's our local guy. Pleasure, uh, poor soul? Oh, he's just jealous. Scott seems to think that I envy pilots. I see, Airline Pilots Association. They're an insufferable bunch. So, how's it look out there, Howard? - Pretty bad. - Survivors? So far just two, a passenger and a captain. Out of how many? - 130, maybe. - Oh, god, that's awful. You want to get checked in first? No let's get out to the site. Look it, if the pilot's still alive I want to go and see him. It's me, hun. Can he hear me? I never for a minute believed this could ever happen. Could, could we be alone? Could I be alone with him just for a minute? I'm not gonna let you go. I mean it. Come back to me. Please. Doctor Carmine, 4-5-2-3, Doctor Carmine, 4-5-2-3. Mrs. Halstead? Yes. I'm Scott Cody, how's he doing? I don't know, he, uh, it's pretty scary. How are you doing? Who did you say you were? Scott Cody, I'm your ALPA representative. - Airline Pilots Association. - Yeah. - You know my husband? - No, we've never met. - Look, Mrs. Halstead, - Call me Diane. Okay. Diane. Is there anything that the association can do for you? You got a room, you need a place to stay? No, I'm gonna stay right here. Is there anything I can do for you personally? Yeah, you can tell me what the hell happened. [somber music] * [chatter] * Hey Goddard! Goddard! Well, I guess we're outta here. Any equipment you're gonna be needing? No. I very much appreciate your help, Lieutenant. What'd we do? Doused a few fires, find a couple of survivors? - Wish to God it had been more. - Thanks. Wes, look who's here. Sergeant! How'd that man get in here? The priest? Let him in myself, he's giving last rites, why? Because he's not a priest, grab him! - You're kidding? - I'm quite serious. Sergeant, we mean it, stop him! Hey you! Get that man! Hey! Stop! Hold it! Hey! 'Scuse me! This area is restricted. Special Agent Bryce, FBI. Wes Goddard, National Transportation Safety Board. I'm the investigator in charge. This is Stanton and Hayes. I suppose you're looking for the black boxes? Actually we were wondering about this CIA business? No trace of them yet. The boxes, that is. Probably still in the tail section. We could pull them out for you, if you like. No thanks, I've had a little practice, I think we can handle it. Don't get huffy, just trying to help. Tell us about this CIA thing. Well I guess possessions still nine-tenths of the law. And what's that mean? Apparently they came right in with the crash wagons, makes you wonder where they got their info, right? Anyway they cleared out before anyone could stop them. - With what? - I don't know. Top secret. Spy stuff, maybe. You know how they are about those things. I uh, I hope we're not in your way here. As a matter of fact you are. Well you won't get too uptight if we try to do our job, will ya? We tend to get a little impatient if we can't go to work. Well I don't know, FBI has a little investigation of it's own to do first. Then do the people of the United States a favor, Bryce, try not to disturb this scene too much, we gotta find out why that plane went down. Aren't we touchy. Damn business is tough enough without his attitude. Well well, look here. Know this guy do ya? Hello Ash. I thought you were still serving five to ten in Joliet. Well you gotta know how to use the system. What's he got on him, Sergeant? I don't know, cash, a lot of jewelry, I haven't counted it yet. Yeah well his last haul was fifteen thousand. You know Ash, I spotted you fifty yards away. If you're gonna persist in this line of work I strongly suggest you consider plastic surgery. Might be an improvement. Harwin! Wes, we're gonna go on ahead. Yeah, we've set up a temporary morgue in hangar 5, we'll be out of your way as soon as we can. Good, look I hate to ask you this but try to keep your people from kicking the tin around, okay? It's important to document the exact location of the wreckage. In some cases even the smallest little fragment can tell a big story. I don't know how to describe what I am seeing here. Just total devastation everywhere you look. Bodies, fragments of bodies, luggage, wreckage of the plane itself strewn for nearly half a mile. The furrows in the earth indicate the wings struck the ground at a steep angle, but why? We know there was a bomb threat. Some eye witnesses say they saw an explosion, others saw lightning strike the plane. One claimed an engine was on fire. These, I'm sorry to say, are not extraordinary events, but one thing is. According to air traffic control, the pilot, captain Gregory Halstead refused, actually refused to follow their instructions, and flew into the most dangerous part of the storm. Of course, that is when the plane went down. So it seems to me that federal investigators have their hands full. All we can do at this point is await further developments. This is Spence Ullman for your news watch. The pilot's from Virginia right? How are your contacts there? Pretty good. If not, I'll make some. Why? The pilot. Arguing with the tower? Never heard of that. Possible bomb aboard? Flying in dangerous weather? And argues with the tower. There's gotta be a story behind that. I want to know about that man, I mean everything. Okay I'll get on it. The NTSB press conference is tonight! A push like that is gonna cost. Who cares? This is hardball. I want the goods and I want it honest. I know that tone of voice. You smell blood, don't you? Look, everybody's got something to hide, including Halstead. Dig it out! I want it. I don't envy you, this. How's it going? We're just swamped. We're all on overload here. But we'll do what we can. Look, what about the families? They're arriving in bunches now and they all want on the site. They seem to think they can help with the identification. - Can they? - No, not really. I haven't got that much faith in eyeball ID anyway and besides the bodies are unviewable. Then tell them that, hope they'll understand. - Here's something. - Ah, you recognize that? Part of our uniform. That would be... Whoever was in the galley jump seat. Oh, god. Lorraine, oh no. Oh, oh you knew her. - How's it going, chief? - You tell me. We pulled the black boxes, they look pretty good. Cool, get them back to Washington. Long gone. Hey, something moved! Where? Here! Here. Oh my god. It's a dog! We're gonna have to cut it out. - Hurry! - [dog whining] Bakerson? Yes. Tell me sir, do you have any family or friends out here? Here? No, nobody. Well, who's looking out for you then? Oh they're all very nice here. I mean personally? Who's looking out for you personally? Well, I'm... I was gonna say Em but she's... Your wife? I was right there and I still don't believe what happened. That's where we come in Mr. Switzer. We can help with that. If you take a look at that card there, you can see I work for a law firm. Law firm? What's that got to do with me? We're deeply concerned about you. Matter of fact, Mr. Harmon himself is coming down here just to see you and I think you should talk to him. [groans] Honey, I'm right here. I'm right here, honey. I'm right here. Guess we got a hold up problem here. We can handle it. What did you say? I said we can handle it. - I like that 'we.' - So do I. You alright? I guess this is not one of my better days. Hello. Honey this is Scott Cody. ALPA? How you doing, skipper? It's a bitch. I killed all those people? No, I kinda doubt it, you got an outstanding flight record. Last thing I remember is hitting that storm cell, and then, all goes. Well don't you worry about that now, huh? Probably the medication, it'll come back to ya. I thought you didn't know my husband? Or were you just saying that about his flying ability? Nope, got his training history and all his flight records. That was quick. Well, the airline sent it over. Diane, I think you ought to know that we're going to be going into his entire background and releasing that to the media. Good. I want people to know about him. You'll get your shot, we'll be taking a deposition from you and uh, it'll get pretty personal. Particularly about the last forty-eight hours, so I'm afraid you won't have much privacy for a while. - Who's we? - Myself and some NTSB people. I thought you were the pilot's association. Yes I am. You see, NTSB has to run the investigation that's the law, I represent the pilots as an invited guest. I offer whatever expertise I can and try to protect our side. And what side is that? The truth. Whatever that may be. I went through that crash like it was nothing. Wife dying and all. For some reason it just never really hit me. And I'm wondering 'what the hell's wrong with me' you know? And then last night I went through that crash all over again, I mean I really went through it, and not just once. Each time it got worse. - Am I losing my mind? - No, not at all. It's called post impact trauma, Mr. Switzer. It can happen to most anybody. I'm not sure I can handle all this. No, of course not. What you need is professional help, and that's what I'm here for. Well, I don't know. A while ago, an insurance guy was in, he said he'd - take care of all that. - What insurance guy? Uh, airline I think. Real nice guy. Real considerate. 'Nice'? You know, the company that this man represents Mr. Switzer is gonna start poking around in your private life to see if you've got anything to hide. Then they're gonna use it against you to keep you from taking them to court. Oh yes, yes, they can really do that. Courts? Boy. I don't know. Well, you stick with me, Mr. Switzer, there ain't gonna be any courts. Hey, I can't afford no lawyer. You don't understand. Mr. Switzer, you and your wife bought a ticket to get from point A to point B but you never made it, and the fault lies with the airline. So they pay. They pay you and then they pay me. It's as simple as that. So what do you say? What do you think? You know, this happens every single time. You want the cause of the crash? Well if we knew that, we wouldn't even be here. But surely you have some idea. And that's the other thing, you want us to speculate. We don't do that. Board policy is to issue statements of fact, period. Now, if you wish to draw conclusions from those facts, you're free to do so. What about the bomb threat on Senator Charleston? That's under the FBI's jurisdiction, they've launched their usual thorough investigation. - And? - So far, nothing conclusive. Mr. Zullman? According to my sources, the pilot has no recollection of the crash, is that accurate? The last thing he remembers is penetrating the cell, yes. Well, did he say anything about his argument with the tower? I wouldn't characterize it as an argument. You wouldn't? Have you run the tapes? - Several times. - Then what would you call it? I'd say two individuals operating with conflicting information. And one of them had to be wrong. - That's your opinion. - Oh, come on now. WE all know the towers information was correct. That pilot flew directly into a storm cell. The most dangerous cell in the area. Mr. Zullman, that particular pilot has accrued a total of fifteen thousand flying hours, the last two thousand of which were in this aircraft type. Let me tell you about that particular pilot, Mr. Goddard. There is an experimental drug called Procolene used to increase sexual potency. This drug has not been approved by the FDA, but apparently that didn't matter to that pilot of yours because at the time of the flight he was on that drug. We have no such information. Well I do, and I can document it. - How's he doing? - About the same. What's the matter? We gotta talk. What is this Procolene stuff? - How do you know about that? - What is it, Diane? I don't think it's any of your business. You know better than that. Alright, it was prescribed by a doctor. - Airline doctor? - No, Doctor Breck. He said try it, maybe it will help solve the problem. What problem? We're -- I'm trying to conceive alright? That depends, does the airline know that he's on this stuff? - No. - And why not? Because Procolene's harmless, it's like, it's like taking aspirin. Who says? Dr. Breck. And I was there! Greg said, 'hey doc, is this drug legal, is it gonna affect my flying, is it gonna make me drowsy or dizzy or anything?' And he said absolutely not. It's been prescribed by doctors for fifteen years. There's nothing dangerous in this, Scott. Greg would have known, I would have known. And Greg would never have gotten on an airplane, that's how he is. Who is this Dr. Breck anyway? He's a fertility specialist. I have trouble conceiving and on top of that, Greg's sperm count is down. And you look totally unconvinced. Who put you onto this anyway? Spence Zullman. And it was carried nationwide. Now I don't know how many people saw it but I do know this - they heard only one thing: the pilot of Flight 1501 was on drugs. What are these people thinking? How can they get away with this? Di, I don't remember the crash. I was not drug crazed, that much I do know. Oh but you were, that's why you can't remember. That's what they're all saying, and the one's who aren't saying it are thinking it. Zullman sure knows how to stack the deck, doesn't he? Take it easy, it's just one more problem for us to solve. We'll get through this one too, you'll see. - You promise? - You doubting me again? No, sir. Never again. That's good, because I am going to walk out of here and fly ten million more miles and we're gonna have babies by the... houseful. Houseful? I'd settle for one. You look so tired. Guess I wasn't as convincing as I thought. Oh, come on. You've never lied to me before. We've been lucky, you know? - The two of us? - I know. It's like a tape, I can look back at my whole life, I mean the whole thing. If you Fast Forward it, it's simple. It's just like a rollercoaster with ups, downs, trying to stay alive. Maybe accomplish something. - What have I accomplished? - Well, you got stuck with me. Stuck? You're not gonna get out of it either. I need you, kiddo. You're life and breath to me, so, just knock off this past tense stuff okay? I don't like it. Yeah. Alright, Mr. Lindenwood is going to feed the flight recorder data into our computer and come up with a visual reconstruction of the crash. You mean we'll be able to sit down and watch it, actually watch the crash happen? That's right, this particular flight recorder tracks -- what, Bob, seventy three different functions? To name a few, altitude, angle of attack, pitch, roll, magnetic heading, position of control surfaces, thrust, hydraulic pressures. Et cetera, all in binary code. What about the cockpit voice recorder? Via the black box. People I'm sorry to have to tell you we've lost the golden nugget. Oh, what? Why, what happened? Sometime before impact, three circuit breakers popped simultaneously, wouldn't reset. Moment later no cockpit mic. There anything on that alleged secret cargo? Isn't that a mess? You know, it's worse than you think. It's CIA stuff. They've got some kind of spy satellite, maximum security clearance is required and all that. Bob, this is critical. We've got to know what was in that crate. Well we may get that chance. The Department of Defense lawyers got into it. Oh those guys. Apparently they're working on some kind of compromise, they might even make it available to us. They're gonna be on our side for once? Hope springs eternal. So what you're saying is something's in the works, right? - Right. - Good. Stanton, what have you got? Well, we had a fire. Apparently post-crash, fuel-fed, it had to be really. Minimal damage except in the fore and mid cargo compartments, it got a little hotter in there. Anything significant in that? Nah, I don't think so. The wing tank ruptured right next to it. Post crash fire. Alright, so much for that. What brought the plane down, folks? We're running out of possibilities here. Unless of course there was a bomb on board. Mr. Bryce, the FBI got a position on that yet? Well, we found no structural revelations. Since then we've looked everywhere for explosion signatures, chemical residues, labs been over everything including seat and carpet samples. - In short -- - About time. We found nothing that would not be there naturally. Don't suppose there's another way to put that? We found no evidence of sabotage. You can rule out a bomb. - And that's official. - It's official. Thank you. Which brings us to the drug thing. We have that, Wes. Where is, uh... Pam, could you help me out, could I see your D file? - Yeah. - We ran a tox on the pilot, now this stuff was in his system so we telephoned the pharmaceutical company and they faxed us all the critical data on Procolene. Are we in trouble on that? No no, we ran a pretty good study. We're satisfied Procolene has no adverse affects on performance. You mean there's no drug crazed pilot? There's nothing blatantly abnormal here. Of course that's not what Zullman says. Wes, we could question the pilot's judgement. Flying into an ominous cloud on final approach. Could just be a wind shear accident. Oh come on Scotty. The controllers specifically vectored him away from that cell and yet he flew right into it anyway. That's a judgement problem and you know it. Pilot error. What else is there? No bomb aboard, no structural failure, no in-flight fire. If you've got a better answer, let's have it. Overhead bins opened up, and all that stuff started flying around, hitting people. I seen one of them stewardesses, I saw her face, and she was really scared. That's when I knew we was really in for something. Is this kinda what you want? Doing fine, Mr. Switzer, just whatever you remember, okay? It was rough, and we was getting jerked from side to side, and I looked out the window cause I could hear that engine changing pitch, down. Which side of the plane was that? The left side. And then we started tipping down, and then my side of the plane went over, and then all of a sudden we just rolled over, and just like that, over and down. And I told myself 'this is it, this is as far as we're gonna go, right here,' and I looked at Em there, and she's looking back at me, perfectly calm. I'll never get over that. And then we hit the ground, and my seatbelt, liked to cut me in half, and my guts is up in my mouth, and that stuff just hit me in the face. What stuff was that? Well, it was like gravel, and it was hot, real hot, and then it was dark, black. And that seatbelt was really hurting so I popped it open and then I'm falling through the air, and I realized I'd been upside down. I hit the bottom and I'm yelling for Em, feeling all around, and it's dead quiet in there. Smoke and all, lots of smoke. Sheesh. I had to get out of there. Um, you got out of the plane, obviously, um... - Do you remember how? - No, I can't. I remember being in this field and there's this guy sitting there in his seat, then I started seeing lights and then people are coming, and I said 'hey fella, come on, you can get up now, it's all over!' And I walked around in front to see him. And there's this, there's this... I'm sorry. There's this big chunk of plane just sticking... Would you like a break, Mr. Switzer? Them rescue people, I gotta tell ya, they're something else. In my book, everyone of 'em's a hero. Let's, let's take a minute. Let me get you some coffee. How come I'm still alive? Will you answer me that? Em is sitting right next to me, you know how tight them coach seats is. Why her, instead of me? Can you answer me that, for God's sakes, I can't... [sobbing] May I see your ID, sir? Let's get this thing going, huh? Bit testy this morning, are we? Better get you back to bed. Okay, firing up the radar. Since we don't have any storm cells handy I parked that flying classroom out there as a stand in. - How's it read to you? - It's a reasonable facsimile. Makes a good return, sure. Dr. Van Buren! Will you fire up that bogey you've got over there or whatever it is that nobody else can look at but you? Sour grapes, Mr. Goddard? Okay... It is now powering up. It's gonna take a few seconds to stabilize though. Should lock in... about... now. [beeping radar] Dr. Van Buren, you wanna turn that thing on and off a couple of times? Okay. Now back on. You're not supposed to ship live electronic equipment in a plane, that's strictly forbidden. Now do you know anything about rise times, square waves, anything like that? Not a clue. Alright, inside of this CIA thing, there is a, some kind of a continually changing code. It's built in so that it can't be compromised by the enemy. Apparently this causes it to broadcast odd harmonics. Now the trouble is, these harmonics interfere with the key frequencies used to calibrate radar equipment in the nose. And you're not following any of this are you? Nary a syllable. Alright. What it amounts to is, this spy stuff skewed Greg's radar. Not all the time, just some of the time, and one of those times happened to be when he was on his final approach coming into Dayton. Are you telling me, are you telling me that the - radar lied to him? - Yeah you could say that. It told him that the storm cell was thirty degrees out of position, and that's why he flew straight into it. He thought he was avoiding the cell when in fact, he -- He flew straight into it. Right. Oh, thank god. Thank god, Scott. It was the one thing I couldn't understand, it just didn't make any sense to me, him flying into a storm cell. He just... he wouldn't do that. I can't wait to tell him, you know he, he halfway believes he crashed that plane. Hold on, slow down now. Why? You just said that radar was compromised. Well there's a little more to it than that. For instance? The plane came down at an unusual attitude. What does that mean? - You want it straight? - Yes. It's beginning to look less and less like a wind shear accident. SO what is it then? Way it looks now, but this is just now, mind you, and regardless of the radar thing -- Don't say pilot error to me. You said you wanted it straight. That's what you're thinking? That's what they're all thinking? Fine. You're wrong. Several days after the crash, the grim task of identifying the victims of ConWest flight 1501 continues. Refrigerated trucks are being used to store the dead until the team of pathologists, assembled from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, finish performing the autopsies. Several dozen grieving relatives of the crash victims visited a hangar at the airport to claim the luggage of their loved ones. As the family members walked out of the hangar, suitcases in hand, some had to be helped after breaking down. [crying, sobbing on TV] Georgia Kimm reporting from Dayton. Here she comes now, here she comes. Mrs. Halstead! Please, please, ladies and gentlemen! Let us through! All your questions will be answered in due course! Everyone please take your seat. Everyone now please sit down. Thank you. I'd like to introduce Diane Halstead, the wife of Gregory Halstead, the pilot of flight 1501. She has a statement she would like to make. Mrs. Halstead, does the airline know your husband was on drugs? Excuse me Mr. Zullman I said she has a statement to make, the floor is not open to questions. That's alright. I'd like to answer that. As a matter of fact I'm glad he asked. My husband was not on drugs, plural, Mr. Zullman. Only one. Procolene. He was taking it in the hopes we might have a child. Were you aware that this drug was not approved by the FDA? No, our doctor said it was no more harmful than aspirin. He's been giving it to his patients for years. Was the airline aware of this? No I just told you, Procolene is not dangerous. Well that's one opinion. It's not an opinion, Mr. Zullman, it's established fact. Procolene has been available worldwide as Gexistran. It's been on the FDA approved list for over fifteen years. It's used to increase blood circulation. The only known side effects are dry skin and the possibility of increased male fertility. And to my knowledge, Mr. Zullman, neither of these things has brought down an aircraft. I think you knew that. I think you knew the truth about Gexistran and I think it is totally irresponsible of you to sensationalize all this and say that my husband was on drugs. I stand by my story, your husband was on Procolene and Procolene has been rejected by the FDA. It was not rejected, Mr. Zullman, it hasn't been accepted yet, there's a difference. It's still being tested for it's effectiveness on male potency. What I'm trying to say to you is it does not produce drug crazed pilots. Well I hate to state the obvious here -- Mr. Zullman, I think the lady has answered your question, now that's enough. Please, go ahead. At 5:31 this morning, my husband succumbed to crash induced injuries. He died not knowing, he died not knowing how or why his plane went down, or what, if any part he played in that tragedy. My husband was a wonderful pilot, especially in emergencies, and his concern was always for the safety of his passengers. Unfortunately, there's been growing speculation over what is being called 'pilot error.' I know my husband, and I know that he did not cause that plane to crash. And I will not rest until I find the real cause. Thank you, that's all. Mrs. Halstead, you said during emergencies, what emergencies? You'll have to excuse me. I have a funeral to arrange and a plane to catch. Mrs. Halstead, if I could just one further -- Where the hell is your sense of decency? Now that's it! Looks like pilot error. Yeah, pilot error. I mean I don't know now. The guys dead, what are we gonna do with that? Well if he can't defend himself, it can only help us, right? Yeah, but to do what? Beat up on a dead guy, sue the widow, take away her house? Nobody wants that. There's no money in that anyway. Maybe yes, maybe no. Look, the airline, that is the deep pocket, the only deep pocket, and we gotta make them culpable and I mean bulletproof. You understand? A bulletproof case. I don't know, Chet. Airline's got a pretty good out. They've even heard about the drugs. Yeah? Wife said that, didn't she? I mean it struck me odd, the minute it came out of her mouth. I mean who would volunteer information like that? Nobody's that honest. Put us right in the toilet too. Dammit. I don't like the way it's going, Nick. - I feel naked as hell. - Why? Well I'm being interviewed tonight, remember? So? Well, this is national coverage, I may not get another shot like it. I need something sensational and I haven't got it. Come on, what do you call Switzer? One survivor out of 128 people and we got him. For once the heavyweights are all out in the cold. Blew us right out of the water. How could she? Maybe she's not that honest. What are you talking about? Well, depends. See, if it comes back pilot error, forget pensions and benefits. The airline has a cutoff clause? Oh yeah. Schlock airline. Smart contract though, huh? Could save ConWest a bundle. Yeah, send the widow right up the... Hold it there. Oh no they don't, not to me they don't. I'm gonna shoot this right back in their face. You've said some interesting things here, somewhat hypothetical. You're accusing her of, what? Collusion? Conspiracy? Hey Paul, I am just asking -- - [phone ringing] - Hello? It's Cody, what are you doing? - Packing. - Turn on channel 41. I have a plane to catch. No, there's something you oughta see. - Scott! - Just turn it on. But we have got 127, well 128 dead, now, I mean 128 people dead. Who is responsible? Still sounds like an accusation to me. But go ahead. Alright, I'll ask another question. If you were the widow and you knew that you were about to lose all your pension and benefits and the airline comes to you and says 'we would like to offer you a deal,' would you listen? What? Is this just speculation or do you have -- Understand now, I am not accusing anyone of anything, all I am saying is there are certain questions that need answers. Now suppose you were the widow, the airline comes to you they say 'look, we want to restore all your pensions and benefits and maybe slide a little something under the table, all you gotta do in return is say 'we don't know anything about the drugs.'' Well? Is that a good deal? I mean would you say yes to a thing like that? I am still so angry, just can't believe that bastard Harmon. You'd think he'd at least wait until after the funeral. Oh I don't know, I think maybe he did me a favor. How in the world can you say that? Oh, when all the aviation experts gang up on you and they all tell you you're wrong, you start to think you're wrong. But now, by God, Harmon made me angry, and I'll tell ya something else, I'm not wrong about Greg. I'm not! He did not cause that plane crash. And starting tomorrow, somehow, I'm gonna prove that he didn't do it. Well I still think that Harmon should be lynched. Hell, that wouldn't hurt either. I'll call you tomorrow. Are you gonna be alright? Thanks for the lift. [melancholic music] * Mrs. Halstead, this is Judy from the dental office, I'm just calling to remind you of your appointment on Thursday. See you then. Hi Di, it's me. If you're there pick up the phone. Ah, damn. Didn't want to miss you. Um, we've got a delay here before we take off and I just wanted to talk to you. Sorta explain to you what I'm going through. In the first place, I'm sorry, and... just bear with me about this pregnancy thing, will ya? We'll have our child, don't worry about that. Anyway when I get back from this flight I want to spend time with you. Lots of time. Let's just go back to that inn in Carmelo with the fireplace, ah, I wanna do all the good things with you again. Let's just give ourselves a break and just be lovers again, okay? What do you say? And maybe the child will just come! I... Whatever happened to phone booths with privacy? Anyway look I gotta go get ready to fly and I just wanted to say that I love you. I love you. And as long as we have each other, we can't lose. I love you. I'll be seeing you, bye. [cars honking, phone ringing] Yeah, hello? Scott? Diane Halstead. Look I know I woke you up, it's three o'clock in the morning. Oh thanks I really needed to know that. I'm sorry. I need your help. Okay. What's up? I remember you saying that they're putting the plane together. Yeah the airframe guys are doing that. Where? Uh, it's in a rented hangar here in Dayton. Look cant this wait? We're all gonna be back in DC tomorrow night. But the wreckage is in Dayton! I've gotta have a look at it! Why? You don't know what to look for. - No, but you do. - Well, no not really. - You know more than I do. - That's not the point. Look the NTSB guys are the real experts why don't we just let them handle it, huh? Has the board made a decision yet? No. But it is going to come out 'pilot error.' And look, I hate that idea just as much as you do but there's no way around it now. Then make me believe it. Prove it to me. Maybe then I can get some sleep. Why me? Because you're the only one I've got. Besides I'm booked on the next plane. [directions being shouted] This held up pretty well. Well, strongest part of the airplane. It's funny what impact will do, it's so damn capricious. Remember Switzer? The fellow they found wandering around in the field? - Yeah. - He was up there, 19 A. What spared him, I wonder? And then there's the dog, of course. Down in the forward cargo compartment. He survived for almost a week. He died? Amazing that he survived at all. Oh my god look at this. Must have been pretty hot in here, huh? Yes, mid cargo compartment. Took out the CVR, APU controls, engine controls, they all run through here. Took all of those out, and about half of the hydraulic system running aft. That would have been before the crash or after? We wondered about that too. We've got an in-flight fire here, we said. Explains everything. The lost CVR, circuit breakers popping, and the control circuits for the throttles go through here. Sure, cut the circuit, cut the fuel right? And the number 2 engine went dead, we know that. Sure, an in flight fire! So that's what happened? Well then we realized you see, this is the mid cargo compartment, which means a class D compartment. - That ended it, no fire. - I don't understand. A class D compartment is pressured but there's no air, no oxygen. Or very little. And of course no oxygen no fire, fire feeds on oxygen right? Too bad, I rather liked the theory myself. You see, the controls for the rudders come through here. They're cooked too. Kinda hard to land a plane without a rudder. Well wait a minute what if a fire had gotten started in there somehow? Just as impossible. What an idea, Scott, an in flight fire! He's right, it would explain everything. These guys built the plane and they say no fire, why do you keep pushing it? You know why. Fine, have it your way. What kind of attitude is that? Alright look, when I told you pilot error, you said - make me believe it. - Yes and I meant it. When we get to Washington tonight I got something to - show you. - What? The flight data recorder is intact, I think you know that. The lab used that information to reconstruct the last moments of the flight, got it on a tape. It's, uh... totally accurate, and I think you oughta see it. Approach control this is ConWest 1501 descending to three thousand proceeding direct to the Monitor Airport. We're painting some fairly heavy storm cells between here and the airport. If you can, request radar vectors around the activity? Cells are building rapidly in all quadrants. Looks like the softest spot might be, turn right heading 0-3-5, descend to and maintain three thousand, over. Wait a minute that puts us right into a big one. Well we show that to be about the best heading for you, sir. Doesn't look that good to us. We're gonna maintain present heading 1-8-0. Alright, here it comes. According to our radar that puts you right in the middle of the largest cell. You sure you're up to this? Well I'm gonna have to go by what we see here. Ask me when it's over. Seems to be the best way to get through this stuff. Not according to our radar, but... You are the captain. Maintain heading 1-8-0, you're cleared to land on runway 1-8. Flaps 15 landing gear down. Something's wrong here, I don't like the looks of this. Flight attendants, take your seats now. And right here is where they hit the storm cell. Oh my god look at that. Dropped about fifteen hundred feet there. Where'd this damn thing come from? Hang on, it's -- boy this is a rough one. But he's holding it. Look at him fly that plane. This is where they lose number two engine. We've lost number two engine! Damn, too much water! Maybe not, try an air start. See the wing drop. Lose it how? Well, I would say it flooded, too much water. - Is that possible? - I've had it happen. 1501, we now show you in the worst of it. What are you painting on your radar? 1501? 1501? We've got no... 1501? [static] That's it, they're on the ground. I don't understand, why did it....? Why did it just roll over like that? Because Greg failed to use the rudder. All he had to do was apply right rudder to prevent the roll and that plane would have landed safely. Oh that's impossible, he wouldn't just sit there and not make a correction! Look, the flight data recorder doesn't lie. Here, see it for yourself. Okay... left engine pulls down, and... look see right there? The rudder stays in a streamlined position... all the way through impact. What was he trying to say? What was he trying to say, 'we've got no' what? No left engine, what else could it be? He wouldn't say that, he doesn't talk like that, he'd say, 'number 2 failed,' or 'we lost number 2.' - Hold on now, hold on. - What did Chadwick say? What did he say about the rudder? About the rudder controls, they're cooked too? And you can't land a plane without a rudder! Diane... Well it's the only thing that makes sense to me. You're not being realistic. No rudder. That's what he was trying to say. 'We've got no rudder,' well, couldn't it be?? You're holding on to nothing. There was no fire. There couldn't be a fire. Don't you think I want it too, for God's sake I'd give anything if I could believe it, but the facts just don't support it. How can you say that? Because flying's my business, dammit, I know what I'm talking about. - And I don't I suppose. - That's right, you don't. You are holding on to an impossible idea. Because you don't want to face what happened. Don't talk to me like that. Alright let me give you my version, okay? Greg flew through the tough stuff, the really tough stuff, and then apparently, because there is no other explanation now, apparently he just flat lost it. Or he blacked out. No. That is totally unacceptable to me. You're fooling yourself. There's no way around it anymore. There's nothing left but pilot error! No! I admit I had my doubts but not now. And no matter what you think, as far as I'm concerned, this investigation is over. Got some pretty good scotch inside, what do you think? Well now I call that an idea! As long as you promise not to shoot me. I asked you to make me believe it and you did. - Rocks alright? - Yeah, fine. Here we go. You're taking this very well. No, I'm not. I don't think I've ever been so wrong in my whole life, gonna take me a little while to get used to it. Here's to the truth. Whole truth and nothing but. What's the matter? You shouldn't have said that. Said what? Something's bothering me. There's a loose end. The golden retriever. What about it? You go through a plane crash, you're trapped in the wreckage for days, and what happened? I don't know it just died. Why? What killed it? At this point, what possible difference could it make? Well if we don't know what killed the dog, we don't know the whole truth do we? Maybe we don't care what killed the dog. Come on, not a little bit curious? Not one little bit. For the first time ever you disappoint me. Lady, I've walked the last mile for you and then some. But this is it. Right here is where I get off. Oh no it's not. So where is she now? In the lab with Stanton. And you actually autopsied the dog. Well you tried to say no to her, where did it get you? Thanks for lunch, I'm outta here. You think this is funny, don't you? What did the autopsy say? - Toxic fumes. - Isn't that a surprise. Matter of fact, it was. What, with all that burning insulation? Come on. Precise cause of death was, and I quote, 'inhalation of sodium based toxins.' unquote. - Get that pal? Sodium. - On an airplane? Where the hell did that come from? Why do you care? You're outta here. I am a party to this investigation, you know. You know, Scott, you're a good man, but you're a little lacking in, uh, whimsy. - So where was the dog? - Let's take a look. The dog was here, in the fore cargo compartment. But the thing is, there were no sodium products of any kind in there, where did they come from? So we looked in the mid cargo compartment here, in pink. Found a variety of things in there. Ten cases of bottled water, sodium free, miscellaneous items of hardware, twelve cartons of computer print out stock, various other things all chemically inert. And then, we came to this. Somewhat unidentifiable flying object, listed in the manifest only as, quote, laundry chemicals, unquote. Bob, Pam, what have you got? We may be on to something, come take a look. Ah, yes. Wes, I want you to look at these witness marks. See how they run the length of it? That indicates that on impact this was lying on it's side. Which means its contents possibly leaked out during the flight. Horrible looking mess. What was in it? You know that's what I wondered. So I called the guy who shipped it, Wes, right away he got feisty with me. I said to him, oh yeah? Well fine. I'll be seeing you. So I flew up to Newark New Jersey where his plant is. Ah, I was met by his lawyer. Well then I knew I was onto something. So I says to his lawyer, now you listen, we have federal subpoena power, do you want to play ball? - You got an answer. - You know I did. What was in it? Well for one, a ten gallon polyethylene drum, now I have a replica over here. It was filled with H2O2. Hydrogen Peroxide. You mean like the household stuff? No that would be at a three percent solution, this was at fifty percent strength. Now, in contact with other materials, it's a violent oxidizer that can cause spontaneous combustion. Well that can't be legal on airplanes. Absolutely not. No wonder the guy was feisty. Now this stuff can release huge quantities of oxygen. On top of that, the rest of the drum was filled with, and here's the magic word, sodium orthosilicate. They filled it in and packed it down tight. Pretty corrosive stuff. Dare I ask, could it have started a fire? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Not only that but supply its own oxygen. Did you hear that Scott? What do you mean you would think so? It doesn't work. What? Well, we mixed it together and nothing happened. Oh no. Not exactly true, it generated a lot of heat and smoke. But no fire. Yes, but that only represents the first flight. What are you getting at? That that fiber drum started off in Newark, was flown to Washington, sat there for a day, and then was loaded onto flight 1501. But Wes, the real point is, that the drum was lying on it's side which caused the hydrogen peroxide to seep out and soak into the drum. And then it sat for a whole day in Washington - and dried out. - And the result? Well, a fifty percent solution can't start a fire, but a sixty percent solution can, so the question is, how to build up a sixty percent solution. Now come around here. To answer the question, I had to ask myself, 'what if it spilt again on flight 1501?' I mean why not? We know it was on its side, the witness marks show that. I assume you've simulated all of that? - Of course. - And? Well we don't know, yet. Why not, Bob? Because. Well you see, these fiber boards have been soaked in hydrogen peroxide and we're just waiting for them to dry out. What are you getting at? - Patience, Wes. -So let's get on with it. Give one of them a try. Maybe this one's ready. Ah, excuse me, I'm totally lost. It's really not all that complicated. Just think of this as the fiber drum. It's already been soaked in a fifty percent solution. Then you let it dry out, why? Because that's what happened at Baltimore Washington. Yes it dried out, but the hydrogen peroxide is still in there, do you see? At a fifty percent strength. Now, I add the sodium orthosilicate and as we know, nothing happens. However, in my hand, I hold some more of the fifty percent solution of you-know-what. As I simulate the leak... it slowly soaks into the cardboard. Slowly. We wait, tension mounting. And theoretically, somewhere down in that mess, the concentration is building from fifty percent to fifty one, to fifty two -- [board bursts into flame] [laughing] Wow! My god, we've done it! Not so hasty, let's see if it tracks. We did have a fire, it would start here in the fiber drum. Okay. Heat rises, so what's above? The john. First thing to go wrong? Three phase motor and the john kicks off. That's right. Three breakers pop, wouldn't reset. Why? The wires melted. What went next? Cockpit voice recorder. And the voice recorder's circuitry goes right along with the engine controls. And the rudder controls even I know that. Okay, in this order then: big hot chemical fire in the fiber drum, heat rises, three breakers pop, CVR goes south, number two engine flames out and the rudder - controls sever, they die. - Well, what do you know. Does this mean Greg's off the hook? Cause of crash: loss of control due to in flight fire. Period. Had to be. Excuse me. Diane? You alright? Fine. So, another day, another hot miserable muggy day. I don't know, I think it's gonna be beautiful. You never give up do you? So where's the press when you need them, huh? Well I have a statement to make anyway. I was wrong about you right from the start and all the way through, I was wrong and you were right. I want to apologize. My, you're taking this very well. Yes I am. You know, Wes Goddard says that I lack whimsy. He may be right. You're a rock, Scott Cody, don't change a thing. And you are obstinate, uncompromising, and totally impossible. I'm gonna miss that. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah. I'll see you around. According to NTSB officials, in the final desperate moments of flight 1501, captain Gregory Halstead wrestled heroically with the controls of an airplane that was literally burning out from under him. While his in flight radar misdirected him into a deadly storm cell. This plane went down, 128 people were killed, because of one live electronic equipment shipped aboard. Why? To save time. And two? Deadly illegal compounds were onloaded labeled only as quote, laundry chemicals, unquote. The only comfort we can take in this tragedy lies in it's uniqueness. It's very oddity assures us that it can never happen again. [uplifting music] * *
