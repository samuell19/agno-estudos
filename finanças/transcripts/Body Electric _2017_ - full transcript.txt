BODY ELECTRIC I've been dreaming of the sea a lot these days Two days ago I had this crazy dream. I went to this deserted beach, not a soul. The night was pitch dark. No noise but the sound of the sea. I took my clothes off and went swimming. Swimming... Then... a seaweed wave came. It got all over my body until I was wrapped in it. I lost track of where I was. It was only water and darkness. But it wasn't bad at all. - Did you used to live by the sea? - Yes... I have a thing with the sea. I think too much, so sometimes I need to disconnect. And the sea was this place I could go to. Diana! I brought the shirt for you. Take a look. It is a bit loose, Maria. - What should we do? - Let's interface the collar. and the cuffs as well. - Ok, I can do it. - Otherwise, the fit is not fine. I prefer. Ok? Interface collar and cuff. - Ok, I'll show you later. - But do it quickly. We're late. You can take your lunch time here. Here is the kitchen. You can warm up your meal. Some people use it as a smoking area, but I prefer that you smoke outside. This is Elias, my sister's assistant. Any questions about materials, he's the guy to talk to. Fernando is subbing for Tomas until December. Let's go downstairs. I will show your workplace. Here are your gloves, your earplugs. I will show you the machine. This is the technical info file on the production. The management room... CAD system. This is your machine. Gilberto, this is Fernando. He will show you how to operate it. What's up? First time? So, gloves on and make your fingers survive the day. Have you ever seen a machine like that? Cutting machine. Knife. It cuts five hundred fabric sheets at once. Turn your machine on. Press the button on the left. The glove hand in front to keep your fingers in place. It just takes some practice. Is the paper upwards? Yes. - Are you getting it, Fernando? - I understand Portuguese. So push the presser on top of the fabric. Turn the machine on... and turn off. I'm going to teach you how to sharpen it. Turn it on. Now you can press it on the top. Push! Push it like this. Watch your finger. Press it hard, like a man. Fernando, switch it off. Look at me. Pay attention. It's just a click. Do you work nearby? - Just around the corner. - I've seen you around in the mall. I'm always dropping by. - Your order. - Thank you. And what do you do? I work at a clothing factory. I see. Can I have a sandwich? What's up, QRA? Can you close the mall today? Once again? It's every day now. I'll have to leave earlier today. - Once again? - Yes I'm solving some problems. Have you been in touch with him? Well, yes. We talk once in a while. We were good friends in the first place. I ran into Arthur the other day. Did you? Where? In my place. An intimate rendezvous? It was my roommate's birthday. Arthur showed up. We had a quick chat. I think he is nicer. But he has always been so. I didn't find him very nice. He bothered me. I didn't like him. But times were different. I was really into you then. Aren't you anymore? No. It's different now. We are friends. I see. Friends. Your relationship with him was weird. He supported you, paid your bills. - He what? - He paid your bills. What are you talking about? I've always worked really hard. How do you think I can afford this castle? We only lived together, he never paid my bills. I know, but still. It was a different lifestyle. He is rich. That house, those friends. I don't know how you could stand it for so long. Because he is a great guy. But you have to know him to know that. Elias! Please! This band here looks weird. I don't think so. I think the client will return it. I'll come back after lunch and we'll talk it over. Elias! Are the new pieces coming up today? Check it out with Anderson. Well, we won't make it on time. Look. - But I really don't know. - So, let's see what I can do. Where are you from? Guinea-Bissau. Do you know it? I think I've heard about it. But I don't know where it is. Africa's western Coast. What about you? I'm From Paraíba. Paraíba. How is work going? It's fine. I can't have a chat with the machines, but it's fine. I find machines very difficult. I prefer people. This is for you. Thank you. I don't know if I can handle it, Anderson! - Bye - See you. See you on Monday. Look at this fabric! Is this your hand? It's Wellington's, a friend of mine. Check this out. It's nice. I like that one. It's great what you do with lines. - What is behind this? - There is nothing to see. - Let me see! - No! Look how amazing this one is! It's really good. - Do you really like it? - It looks like a pineapple skin. I took it from a tablecloth. Tablecloth? Some observation ones... Hands... This is Fernando, the guy I told you about. Good looking! His face is strong. Here are your things. I'm taking this book, ok? Sure, it's yours. I love this fabric. It's nice. I'm taking these two fanzines. - They are mine! - But I'm borrowing them. May I? As long as you bring them back. I will. Are you spending the whole day correcting tests? The other day I went to a mall close to work. As I got in, I saw a security guard. A tall, strong, stocky dark man. I passed by and looked at him. I saw him looking back. But I wondered if I had got it right. Could be just wishful thinking. I went up the stairs and walked around. Do you know when you feel that someone is following you? I looked behind and there he was. I kept walking And he was still following me. I stopped to grab something to eat. Three minutes later, guess who was standing just beside me? The guy? He sat down, ordered a sandwich and struck up a conversation. He asked if I worked around, and told me he had seen me there before. He kept talking to me and grabbing his dick. Looking at me and always grabbing his dick. He paid his bill and on the way out he winked at me. I rushed to pay and followed him. He took me to a place upstairs at the last floor. It was a room where the guards change, a kind of locker room. There was a smell of sweat, of wet uniforms, of dirty socks. He threw a mat on the floor. He told me "Lay down." I did so. His dick was already hard. I could see his pack through the pants. Then he undressed and said, "You can do whatever you want." And you did? Obviously! We came a lot. Then he dressed up in a hurry and told me "When you show up again, look for me. And don't tell anyone, be discreet". I just said, "Ok." And did you ever go back? Not yet. What did you want to tell me about the factory? Let's take a nap. I'll tell you later. Come on, I'm curious. It's no big deal. We started to get closer. The holidays are coming, so the production increased. When we leave, everyone has a lot in their minds. So, we just want to drain it out. Hi folks, how are you? I just wanted to thank you for your work these final weeks. I'm really glad you accepted to work overtime tonight. As we are close to meeting our goal, I believe three hours will be enough. It is a privilege for me to count with you. Thank you very much! Walter, do we have to be back at 8am tomorrow? Too early, is it? - It's ok to me. - Well, for me is early. Today I'll get home at eleven. To be here at eight o'clock, I have to get up at five. What about half past eight? - It's pretty much the same. - Half an hour of rest. I guess nine is ok. Is everyone happy with nine? Alright then, nine o'clock tomorrow. Thank you, guys! - Sleep here, man! - I need the dough. So ask to be paid as the plant's security guard! - You don't have anyone. - I do have someone! - Where can I buy this lunch box? - Go to the night market. - There's no open market this late! - Of course there is. Ok. Go. It's unbelievable. And then, you only have time to stay with your family. We can't live like that, we got to find a way to go out, get in touch with people. I have to answer this. I'm glad we are hanging out tonight. I can't stand going back home and crying. It's good to go out for a drink. I know, but I got a daughter waiting at home... You look like a pothead... You came after the smell? - Do you have a joint? - I wish. - Nothing? - No, nothing. Do you have a joint? Of course not. Two beers and I'm already tipsy. You are so lame! Take it easy, we're going to the bar. You'd better give it some thought. You have no house, no car and want to get married. Guys, do you have some booze? No, dude. We are discussing life. We'll find something to drink in a moment. Have you already bought the babywear? There he comes making a fuss! You'd better think things over, man. Man, you plan things and so. Then another guy comes and gets the girl. - What's up? - I thought it was just you and I! I thought it too. But they all came. Anderson, you are full of bullshit. - There's no bullshit. - I thought I was special. You are special. You know that. Is there anything more special than these nails? You can't imagine what my nails can do. Oh, fuck! So delicious! Give him some heads up, man... Who is he to give me advice? He's got divorced four times! Hey, what are you talking about? I was just saying that I'm single. - What about you? - Oh my God! - As a said I'm single! - And I'm just fine. Who is getting married? Anderson! We never get there! It's just round the corner! Anderson is getting us into trouble. - Do they serve food in this bar? - Yes, they do! I bet they have colorful eggs. What kind of bar are you used to? Colorful eggs? - Oh, man, everything is closed! - It's not! The booze is a sure thing. - First round is on me! - Two rounds! Oh! I won't fall for this one! - Are you sure? - I'm hard to get, babe! - I'm quite easy! - I can see that! I think I'm not the only one to get married. Will you get married? Yeah! Romantic proposal, a wedding ring... He is sending invitations, but hasn't spoken to Raíssa yet! He sold half his vacation to build a new floor for his home. A new floor or going to the beach? He's going to the beach. Fuck, I'm gonna drink then. Get a beer pack! Have you built the three floors? Three floors? What is it, a condo? It's a triplex! There's Genésio, guys! Oh, gosh! Who's Genésio? She works upstairs in production. I don't know him. A languid white queer. A very shy one. What's up, peeps? Guess who I think it might be? Walter! - I'm sure he is. - He is mysterious. Is there another faggot in the factory? The world is full of faggots. Do you believe you're the only two in the factory? Me... I can tell with just a glance... Who else? Tell us! Are you dying to know? When I first saw you, I got it right away. You are discreet, but still... - At her age I was trouble! - Really? Gee, was I disrespectful! It doesn't look like... What about her father? We got divorced when she was one. He went back to his hometown. They aren't in touch. Does he help you out? No! Not even a penny! Hey, what's up? You fine? You cool? Hey bros! Let's? More than five in this car? There's room for us all! More than five, I'm saying! I can sit on the back! Look there's those two too! The naughty boy is around! Where should I put my backpack? Gee, what an old house! Look at these walls! Hey, Anderson! - Gosh, his parents are around! - Mommy-in-law! - Having a chat with my mom? - Of course, she's wonderful. - Let her sleep! Go have a beer outside. - I wanted to stay with her! I'll go find something to eat. See ya! Let's go to bed, mom! Ok, good night! Bye, guys. - Where's the bread? - In the pantry. - Do you need some help? - Do you think we can turn the radio on? - Excuse me! - The house boss! - The heiress to be! - Can we put some music outside? - Did you bring anything? My cellphone. Is there a speaker around? Let's talk to Anderson. - Anderson! - Hi! We want to talk to Anderson! Are you the owner of the house now? Look at this big house! You wanted lime, right? I want some... Hey, Carla! I got my eyes on you! - Do you want some? - Yes. Gee, I'm starving. Isn't it too noisy? Can they hear it inside? - They are used to it. - Do you throw a lot of parties here? No, but... Oh, I see. Hey, Anderson, say a long phrase! Fucking hell, I'm fucking tired! Now, you say it! Fucking hell, I'm fucking tired! - Sounds different? - Fucking different! Do it on the back too. Where else is sore? My arms. So, turn around. - Here down? - Yes. What about the wrist? Is it sore? A little bit. Do you stretch? Sometimes. It's good to stretch, Wellington. At least before leaving home. What the fuck? Leave it, let's go to the couch! Take off these socks, queen! - He'll get mad! - He won't! Elias, check with Andressa if the dress is ready. Elias? Elias? Elias, what are you doing here? You didn't show up today. I got worried. - Were they asking for me in the factory? - Everyone. How come? I told Carla I wouldn't go. Well, I didn't know. How did you find my house? - I wangled my way here. - Oh, did you? I can see that. But what do you want? Can I go upstairs? They are having dinner upstairs. Better not. Do you have time for a beer? More beer? Why not? How long are you staying here? As long as I have to. I send money to Guinea-Bissau to help my family. Oh, you send them money. Do you help your family too? Not at all. I almost never talk to them. Don't you talk to any of them? I think the last time we talked was last Christmas. It is a very long time! We're very different. Family is the most important thing. My family doesn't talk much. There wasn't much room chatting. Oh, but there is always a way. Who do you talk to when you are sad? I go out, meet people, drink a beer. And is it good for you? We are friends. You can count on me. But, don't show up at my place. I'm in my uncle's, he offered me a bed as a favor. But you can text me or something. Ok. I need to use the restroom. Do you want a napkin? - Gee, I'm so fat. I've eaten 5kg of it. - You're not. - Guys, I made carrot cake! - Maria, you're priceless! I want it, I won't even eat panettone! A quick bite so I go back to work. Who wants cake? The crew wants Maria's cake! What a wonderful cake! I made this one. It's carrot, right? Guys, we even have panettone! Panettone. Christmas, right? Panettone is very fancy! Can I slice it? Of course I can. This cake is really nice. I should open a cake store. You'll make a lot of money. Can you send the pictures to the press lady? Yes, I'll do it tomorrow. Great but work the texts with her. I want to read them before sending to the clients. Will you have internet access there? Hon, I am going to London, not camping. I might not answer it immediately, but I will be online. Ask Walter to register me for the Milan Fair. - I will send him an email. - No, don't send anything. Go to his room and talk to him directly. And remind him to call Osasco's factory. They are requesting exclusivity for next year. Look if work piles up, I don't want you to spend the night here. Take it home. Fine. Have you ever been to London? No. You should, it so you. Happy new year! You too. Try to rest a little, ok? What are you doing? Pasta. Are you hungry? Not anymore... Nasty faggot! I think you put too much water. This is the sauce. But it's a bit watery. My grandma's is thicker. So call granny to cook! Fag, your house is all messed up! Broken shower, watery pasta! Stop complaining, fag! - Is this the mother? - Yeap. Fab! She's in great shape. There's another one of Raíra that I made as well. Who is this? This is Simplesmente. Simplesmente? What a wonderful name! Simply? What a wonderful name! Yes! She's wonderful! Did you make this dress as well? - All of them. - Girl! I don't design, I just make them. Granny taught you well, uh?! Do you like it? I love it. Wow, how gorgeous. Who is she? That one is Gisele. Why "That is one is Gisele"? Cause she's a bitch. An envious gossiper. She talks too much. She throws salt at the girls to look good in mom's eyes so she gets all the jobs. She wants to get rid of her friends. There's no need for that. Isn't it a family? It is, but shit like this happens. How lame! Not one decent piece. I'll take this one. The cutting guys do a shitty job. But these are all defective pieces. Oh, let me take this one. Put this one inside too. Elias, don't you think it's enough? - Calm down, Wellington. - What if they notice? No one will. These are nothing but remnant pieces. Relax. I'm only a handyman, I'm the first one to get screwed. - Queer, take it easy. - See what's inside that box. Girl! Look at these! Wow, it's amazing! I want it, put it inside. Look at this! - Where have you seen it? - I don't remember. On the store dummy, that's where! I know where she saw this wig. On my wall, darling! Look who's back! Girls, this is Elias. Hello. I'm Simplesmente. - Elias, this is Raíra. - Pleased to meet you. Look who crawled out of the grave! This is Marcia, the house owner. Nice to meet you. We brought you some gifts! I hope there's something for me! Of course there is! I see a marvelous fabric here! I actually thought of you. You can make a terrific turban! It looks gorgeous on you. Do you think I like pink? Oh, come on! What can I use this fabric for? Maybe a top? If I know you're doing gigs for shitty money... Excuse me, let's chat a bit. What's up, Elias? Your photo is a shame. I don't know about you but it was real for me. - Do you remember what I've been through? Want to suffer the same? - You know Marcia. - I do, that's why. That's why you like gossips! You better watch out! - Paparazzi! - Attorney! - What comes around goes around. - That's ok for me. If you get me in trouble, I'm not finding you any gig. You like messing things up. Look, what a bitch! Where did you find all this fabric? It's remnant fabric that they were giving away. Oh, it's Christmas and they are giving fabric away? - And all this much? - Yeap. - "Yeap"? I've been around for a long time and I was never given this much fabric. Just shading... So, check this one out So you are a designer and also knows how to sew? Yes. I actually design more than I sew. Can you design something for me? Yes... He'll design clothes for the whole family! Hey, hon, mine first! - Sis, what do you think? - Help me out, Elias. - Look, I'm a mermaid. - You look so cheap! - With or without? - Without for goodness' sake. Elias! I'll ask the stylist because he knows better. - How cheeky! - Of course! You're just a seamstress. Now it's all about Elias? Sure! He's the expert! We have a fashion designer in house! Elias, what do you think? Without. That's it, take it off. You love showing my wigs to everyone. You never let me wear anything. You look good like that. I'll rock with this wig! You'll look marvelous! - Shanuai? - Like a diamond! - Marvelous! - You are so fierce! - I'm a singer, can you tell? - Not really. But I am! - Shanuai, right? - Like a diamond! The restroom is better than the dance floor, uh? - Sis, what about the boy behind us? - Yeah. - "Yeah"? - Yeah. if you say so... - It's all ours, queer! - There's no turning back! Never. Jamais! It's just like they say... Don't even ask... Don't even ask cause I won't suck you hiding in the bathroom. You know, I'm too greedy. I don't want your cock; I want your whole body. Don't even start: "I don't fuck with flamings" Who told you a pretty girl like me wants to be fucked by a macho? A man of your kind, such a specific race... who thinks that can do everything in God's strength and for the glory of the dick. It's crystal clear that this race is going extinct. It was pointless to play macho using a wiener. You are so full of yourself. But I won't swallow it. It's not about being fucked in the ass. Being queer It's about resistance. I admit, even I can't stand being myself. It takes a lot of talent really to be as queer as I am. How old are you, Elias? 23. 23. You look older. - Do I? - Yes, you look older. - Do you like working here? - Yes, I do. - Yeah? Do you mean it? - Yes. I learned a lot from Diana. She taught me everything I know. It's been a great ride and a very important one too. She likes you a lot. You two seem to be in tune. How do you see your life in five years from now? Five years? No... - Is it too far ahead? - Yeah, quite a lot of time. But would you like... to have your own factory and design clothes? I'm not sure. I don't think so. Work relations are very delicate. We've got to know... who are you dealing with, what is around us and also respect the differences between people. Your relations with the staff get me worried Why is it so? Because we need to draw the line between things, the working place and the personal relations. These things shouldn't mix. It's about ethics and respect for the people you work with. Do you agree? I think so. I think you could separate things better. You're very young. You said 23, I thought you were even older. I don't want you to lose yourself for something foolish. I'm worried about you. I feel you're in my team, ok? Vera, bring her a glass of water, please. No! Stop it! Calm down. - Good night! - Bye bye. Alexandre looks like a child among the others. He really can't play! Not a clue. Hey, you! Save the balls, uh?! Don't let them in. If you do... Hey, what about you, eight? This team is quite slow-paced. Tell me your name, eight! Let's fucking score! Whoever scores will have dinner in my place! Whoever scores can sleep over! They are gonna meet grandma. Where's six? You like Diana, don't you? Diana's ass kisser. I have no problem with Diana. I have no problem with her as long as we are apart. She's a very nice person. I'll mix cachaça and lime. Want some? No, I was drinking something else. - What were you drinking? - Catuaba. Hey, Maria, dangerous on Catuaba?! - Are you seeing someone? - No, it's been a while nobody visits me. I can say I have been visited lately! What did you say? Nothing, never mind. Silly! And then I came to São Paulo. I have no family here. I spend my whole day in that grey factory. And I have to move on. But I'm not sure I want to marry. Can I tell you something? Every woman needs a man. And every man needs a woman. What about gays? A gay needs a man. They need someone, you mean. Because gays don't like women, they like men. So they need a partner, right? In your case, you want to work and study... so you can't date a possessive person. You need someone who understands your routine, right? Come on, my place is very fun. It's my first Christmas here, I must spend it with my uncle. Come on! Bring your uncle! I can go on the 25th. - For lunch? - Yes So, let's do it. But you gotta dance samba. - Can you do it? - A little - Dance for me. - I am shy Come on! Babe, it's so good to love you. I need you! Take off your jeans!! Put a thong bikini! Brown girl! You are so sexy! Take off your jeans!! Put a thong bikini! Brown girl! You are so sexy! At the sand beach, our love! At the radio, our song! Our love is full of magic! Full of brown colour! Sweety brown! Sweety brown! Can you lend me your shorts? Just a minute, please! No, I'll be only in underwear. Hold on. Take his bag. Get up. Lean on me. I can handle it. Mind the steps. One more. Can you do me a favor? Get me a towel in this cupboard. Thank you. So, I'm leaving. But I can make some tea before. No, thanks. You can leave it to me. I'll call you tomorrow, ok? Well, good luck. - I'm sorry. Thank you. - No worries. I'll walk you. Happy new year! - Is this the mansion? - Come this way! Stop! We will get stuck, Marcia! This way here! Did you spend New Year's eve here? Yes. Some friends of Arthur's came over and we drank all night long. What did you do? We went to Porchat Island. The girls had a performance there. It was amazing! We stayed there until the day broke in. Will you go back to work tomorrow? What can I do? I got to cover Diana until she's back. What about you? I quit. Really? When? Just before the holiday break. I was talking to Marcia and she told me she could get me some shows. I'm gonna take a risk. Do drag for a living. I'll put it all at stake! What is meant to be is meant to be. That's awesome. What about you... can you handle it? - I'll try. - Of course you will make it. There's a point when we've got to find our way Yes. I'm happy for you. - This is the living room. - Wow! What a view! Bedrooms and bathrooms are that way. It looks like a hotel! This is Arthur. The guys work with me at the factory. Nice to meet you. Make yourselves comfortable. Congratulations on the house! Hey! Alexandre! - How are you? - I'm really great! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! Meet my fiancé, Raíssa. This is Wellington, from work. She's so pretty. Let me introduce you to gang of Sodom. Wow! Guys! Look, Alê has just arrived. There's a crowd outside. Is there any girl out there? - I doubt it... - People are tipsy there. This party seems very private and for really close friends. Do this people work with you? I agree, they make a beautiful couple. Thank you. Have you already set the wedding date? We want it to be in May. May? Why so long? We still have to buy everything. Throw a bridal shower, so people will give you everything! We can also help you. - How? - With a cake. We can “bake” him a cake! Just kidding. We can perform in your bachelor party! And also a bachelorette party, of course! Do you perform? Yes I do. Are you a singer? I'm a drag queen. - And what does Raíssa do? - I'm a teacher. We have a teacher among us! Look! What? You were just saying... - She's a teacher! - For you! A teacher? Do you teach adults too? No... only kids. - It's easier for you to catch up... - Shut up! Aging has made her so shameless. Hey! What's up, dude? I'm so glad you are here. This is the guy I told you about. He's in charge of the factory. He's my boss! Is this engagement thing serious? Yes, it is! Very serious. Guys, I mean it. Is it serious? We want to get married! And have you already chosen a church? - Yes, the Baptist church. - Wow, magnificent! Shot! Shot! Girl, you look so down! And she is drinking even more I can't imagine how she'll ride the motorcycle. I wanna see it! I would love to sleep over. - And where will you sleep? - There are plenty of beds here! She was scared of going into the sea! I'll help her to overcome this trauma! I'm not going into the sea! Dear, I'll help you! No, guys! Just accept it! Is it difficult for you? Oh, queer. Good bye, guys. I gotta hit the road. - Why so soon? - I've got to go. The road is going to be awful, packed with cars. - Cut it out, Alexandre. - Thank you for the invitation! - Sorry for any inconvenience. - No. Aren't you gonna work tomorrow? Stop talking about work. No. I need to get up early. - I loved that you came! - It was lovely meeting you. Alexandre talked about you so much. - Girl, you are pretty. - Thank you. - Babe, he got the keys! - You are not leaving! - Don't be an asshole, man! - You won't leave! I hate fighting! Watch out! Poor friend of mine. She's on the floor. Come on, girls! Let's go! - Hey, there's no way you'll leave! - I have to go! You won't leave! I'll get a ride with her! You'll go with me! I'm getting my bag! Let's go now! Who are you going with? And how am I going to leave later? We'll find a way. Bye little Arthur! Stop it! Why are you leaving? Bye, sweetie! - Hey! Please, stay! - No, I gotta go. Bye. Kisses! Fuck guys! Don't go! Bye Elias! Kisses! Are we going back tonight? I don't wanna go. I wanna stay. Don't you have to work tomorrow? I do, but I won't.
