YOU ARE SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY. AND YOU, YOU'RE A BAIL BONDSMAN-- REALLY? WHAT? I PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. YEAH, IN HOCK UP TO YOUR EYEBALLS. AND YOU -- A THIEF. I AM A GOOD THIEF. LIKE BRAD PITT IN OCEAN'S ELEVEN. MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN IT. I'LL BE SURE TO RENT THE DVD, THANK YOU. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD REASON FOR WHAT'S BECOME OF YOU, BUT THIS IS A BLESSING. THIS IS A SECOND CHANCE FOR US TO BECOME A FAMILY AGAIN. THAT WAS HIS DYING WISH, AND YOU WILL HONOR IT, EVEN IF IT KILLS YOU! [WOMAN NEWSCASTER] WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST FOR A SPECIAL REPORT.

AND THEN, YOU RUN AWAY AND YOU SAY, "GOT YOU LAST." THEN THE OTHER GUY CHASES AFTER YOU AND TRIES TO GET YOU BACK, AND THEN IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN. IT'S GOOD TIMES. A LOT OF FUN. EXCEPT FOR WHEN YOU PLAY IT WITH SAM... 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT SAM WOULD DO? I WOULD FINALLY GET HIM ONCE, REAL GOOD, AND I'D RUN OFF. BUT HE WOULDN'T CHASE AFTER ME. AND THEN I WOULD LIVE IN FEAR, FOR HOURS, SOMETIMES EVEN DAYS, WONDERING WHEN BIG, BAD SAM WAS GONNA ATTACK ME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR BROTHER FROM ANOTHER MOTHER WOULD DO? HE WOULD SET HIS ALARM FOR 3:00 A.M. AND WALK INTO MY ROOM, WHEN I WAS STILL SLEEPING, AND SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF ME. AND I'D BE LAYING THERE LOOKING UP AT THIS MONSTER, AND HE'D LEAN DOWN AND HE'D SAY, "GOT YOU LAST." NOW, THAT'S THE FUNNEST GAME THAT WE EVER PLAYED. THE REST, I KEEP BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY THERAPIST. GROW UP. KISS MY ASS, SAM. GOT YOU LAST. YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE ONLY GOOD AT DESTROYING COMPUTER COMPANIES. DON'T KNOW JACK SHIT ABOUT HOW TO USE THEM. MAY I TALK WITH MY FAMILY SOMEHOW? WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP? YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF OGRE? YOU SEE THE CAMERA? WHAT DO YOU THINK I BROUGHT THAT FOR, NUMB NUTS? THEY SEE YOU, YOU SEE THEM. EVERYBODY CRIES, BEG FOR MERCY, ETC, ETC. NOW, THE FEDS ARE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ALIVE. SO, I RIGGED A LIVE FEED OF A DOW JONES STICK TICKER TO RUN ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THAT WAY YOU CAN READ REAL TIME STOCK QUOTES AND SEE JUST HOW FAR YOUR COMPANY'S GONE IN THE TOILET BECAUSE THEIR FAITHFUL LEADER IS ABOUT TO DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH, UNLESS THEY PAY UP, HMM. IT'S COOL, UH? OKAY. [NINA] UH, LEO NEEDS A FAVOR. YEAH.

HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG, ESPECIALLY WITH YOU, SAMMY THE BULL-HEADED, JUST LIKE HIM. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE ON THIS PLANET I WOULD LET COMPARE ME TO HIM, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. HA, HA... WHAT WOULD YOU DO? SLAP ME AROUND LIKE ONE OF YOUR PERPS? HUH? NOW, WOULDN'T THAT BRING DOWN THE WRATH OF GOD? HA, HA, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NUN. HA, YEAH...

DOUGLAS. HE SEEMS VERY SWEET. FOR A JUVENILE DELINQUENT. WELL, YOU'RE NO PRINCE EITHER AND I STILL LOVE YOU. THAT'S KIND OF HOW FAMILY WORKS. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HELP ME OUT? THE FBI IS GONNA THROW EVERY AGENT THEY GOT AT THIS THING. WILLS IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY'RE GONNA FIND RODRIGUEZ BEFORE WE DO. NO, BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE LOOKING FOR RODRIGUEZ, NOT JUST YET. LOOK, THEY KNOW THAT THIS GUY'S NOT SMART ENOUGH TO PULL OFF SOMETHING THIS BIG. HE'S NOTHING BUT A LIEUTENANT WITH THE CARTELS DOWN IN MEXICO. SO, INTERFERE WITH AN FBI INVESTIGATION AND GET KILLED BY THE CARTELS? YEAH, BUT THERE'S A $5 MILLION REWARD. BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR WILLS, SO THERE IS NO FIVE MILLION. SO WE SPLIT YOUR BOND. THAT'S, WHAT, 10% ON 250 GRAND? 25 GRAND SPLIT THREE WAYS IS 8,333 AND CHANGE. LISTEN, EINSTEIN, THE DEAL WAS, WE WORK TOGETHER, OKAY, AND WE SPLIT THE OLD MAN'S MONEY. THAT BOND IS MINE. NO, NO, THIS COUNTS AS PART OF OUR TWO YEAR SENTENCE. AND THE DEAL WAS, ANYTHING THE COMPANY MAKES GETS SPLIT THREE WAYS. THAT'S THE DEAL. TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT RODRIGUEZ. SLOW DOWN, TURBO. I SEE THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING HERE. YOU'RE SNAPPING OUT ORDERS AND EXPECTING THE TWO OF US TO JUST EAT SHIT. NO. NINA SAID THAT WE WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM. OH, WELL, THANK YOU, JOHN WOODEN. I'M A COP. THAT'S WHAT I DO. ALONG THE WAY, I'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF A CONTRIBUTION YOU MAKE TO THE TEAM. UNTIL THEN, I'M STUMPED. PLEASE, PLEASE. LISTEN, RODRIGUEZ WAS ALWAYS RUNNING HIS MOUTH OFF ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE WAS DATING. THIS FAMOUS STRIPPER DOWN IN MEXICO CITY-- YOU KNOW HOW MANY STRIP CLUBS ARE IN MEXICO CITY? BUT SHE'S FAMOUS, RIGHT? THAT NARROWS IT DOWN. ANGELINA, ANGELINA. THAT WAS HER NAME. IT WAS A SINGULAR NAME, LIKE MADONNA. SAM. JUST HEAR ME OUT, OKAY? HEAR ME OUT. IF RODRIGUEZ IS INVOLVED, HE'S INVOLVED BECAUSE OF HIS CONNECTIONS TO THE CARTEL IN MEXICO. SO, IT'S MY GUESS THAT THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE HIDING WILLS. WE'RE GONNA NEED MONEY TO GET STARTED. SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED? 15,000. THAT WILL GET US STARTED. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE NEED MORE. 15 GRAND? YEAH. WELL... YOU KNOW, I PLAN ON RUNNING A TIGHT SHIP, SAM. I DO NOT WANT TO DIP INTO DADDY'S FUNDS UNTIL YOU'VE ALL PROVEN YOURSELVES A BIT. SO, UH, 10,000 WILL HAVE TO DO, NO MORE. YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE TIGHT WITH 12 MILLION, DON'T YOU THINK? IT'S NOT OUR MONEY YET. THE COMPANY NEEDS TO PROVE ITSELF. IT HAS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I THINK, I THINK 10,000 IS FAIR. OKAY. YOU HOLD THE PURSE STRINGS. WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.OKAY. WELL, YOU WILL BE CAREFUL, WON'T YOU? I MEAN, YOU'LL LOOK AFTER THEM? THEY'RE GROWN-UPS, NINA. I'LL DO MY JOB. I'M NOT A BABY-SITTER. NO, I KNOW, BUT THEY ARE YOUR FAMILY. I'D KEEP PUSHING THE MONEY ANGLE IF I WERE YOU, KID. I'LL SEE YOU IN A WEEK. [SIGHING] YEAH. [♪♪] ♪ YEAH, BABY! ♪ SO, SAM, WHAT'S FIRST? I SAY WE TAKE A LITTLE NAP AND THEN WE HIT THE STRIP CLUBS. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH MY NORMAL ROUTINE IN EVERY NEW TOWN. NO. WE CALL EVERY CLUB IN TOWN AND SEE IF THEY HAVE A FAMOUS, ONE-NAMED STRIPPER, ANGELINA. THAT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT A LIFE TIME. MORON. IT MIGHT NOT TAKE AS LONG AS YOU GUYS THINK. [SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING] EDGAR IS A VERY DANGEROUS MAN. HE WOULD EASILY KILL ME IF HE THOUGHT I WAS A HELP TO YOU. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE HE LEFT FOR AMERICA, OVER A MONTH AGO. LISTEN, ANGELINA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF HIM ANYMORE, OKAY? BECAUSE WE CAN PROTECT YOUNO WE CAN'T. LEO, DON'T OFFER ANYTHING YOU CAN'T DELIVER. IT WOULDN'T MATTER. I CAN'T HELP YOU. I'M SORRY. [SPEAKING SPANISH] OH, HO! YEAH, GET HIM, LITTLE JOE! NO, NO, NO, COME ON!

MAN, IT'S THIS GREAT TELEVISION SHOW ABOUT THIS GUY. HE HAD THREE SONS, ALL FROM DIFFERENT MOTHERS, VERY, VERY RELATABLE TO OUR SITUATION. SAMMY AND I, WE WOULD SIT AND WATCH THE RERUNS WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY TIME WHEN WE WEREN'T BEATING EACH OTHER UP, RIGHT? IT WAS A STUPID SHOW. NO, IT WAS A GREAT SHOW. IT WAS CLASSIC, ICONIC TELEVISION. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BONANZA. THEY DIDN'T HAVE NICK AT NIGHT IN THE SLAMMER?NO. WOW! YOU WOULD BE A PERFECT LITTLE JOE, MAN. HE WAS THE YOUNGEST.WHO WOULD YOU BE, HOSS? NO, NO, YOU'RE HOSS. BIG PECS, POPEYE FOREARMS. PERFECT. NO, HOSS WAS MORE DEFINED BY HIS STUPIDITY RATHER THAN SIZE, AND HE WAS A MIDDLE CHILD -- YOU'D BE HOSS. EAT ME. HEY, THANKS FOR HELPING ME OUT IN THERE, SAM. I'M A COP. I WAS STOPPING A HOMICIDE. WOW! YOU'RE A DICK. IT'S COOL. IT'S COOL. I DON'T CARE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE HAVE NOTHING ON RODRIGUEZ. NOT NECESSARILY. SHE GAVE ME HER APARTMENT NUMBER AND TOLD ME TO STOP BY. SHE SAID SHE WAS HAVING A PARTY. OKAY, DON'T PRESS TOO HARD FOR INFORMATION. SHE'S SCARED. TAKE IT NICE AND EASY. LOOK, YOU'RE SENDING A BOY IN TO DO A MAN'S JOB. SHE ASKED FOR THE KID, LEO, NOT FOR YOU. I KNOW, BUT IT'S A PARTY. I COULD GO UP THERE AND I COULD MINGLE-- YEAH, WHATEVER. LISTEN, ANYTHING IN THAT APARTMENT, ANYTHING THAT GETS US CLOSER TO RODRIGUEZ, OKAY? GOT IT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO MY BEST. WISH ME GOOD LUCK. YEAH, RIGHT. JUST GO.

EDGAR, PLEASE, KILL ME, BUT NOT HIM. HE'S AN INNOCENT AND BLESSED BY GOD! [GUN FIRING] THERE GOES LEO'S 200 GRAND. YEAH, HE'S GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED. OH, WELL. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT DID YOU GUYS GET? RODRIGUEZ' MOTHER LIVES IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED VISTA DEL FUEGA. APPARENTLY, HIM AND HER ARE PRETTY CLOSE. HE TOLD ANGELINA HE'S GOING TO AMERICA FOR A BIG SCORE. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHO TOLD YOU THIS. WAS SOMEBODY AT THE PARTY? IT WAS ANGELINA. SHE WAS PRETTY NICE. WAIT A SEC. I DON'T GET IT. SHE WAS ALL BUTTONED UP AT THE STRIP CLUB? WHAT MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND? SHE WAS, UH, SHE WAS VULNERABLE. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? LEO!WHAT? RODRIGUEZ IS DEAD. WHAT DO MEAN RODRIGUEZ IS DEAD? I MEAN, THE KID WAS IN THE SACK WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, RODRIGUEZ SHOWED UP, SO I HAD TO SHOOT HIM. YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH THE FAMOUS-- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? DID YOU SAY YOU SHOT RODRIGUEZ? WHAT ABOUT MY $200,000? WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER WILLS FOR THE $5 MILLION REWARD. ALL WE NEED IS INFORMATION LEADING TO HIS SAFE RETURN. RODRIGUEZ HAD TO KNOW WHERE THEY WERE HIDING WILLS. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU SHOT HIM! YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY FORTUNATE FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING, THOUGH. LAYING... YOU WERE LAYING, ROMEO. LISTEN, HERE'S HIS WALLET. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING. IF WE GET A LEAD, WE CALL THE AMERICAN EMBASSY, WE CASH IN ON THE $5 MILLION, AND WE GET ON WITH OUR SEPARATE LIVES. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE ARE. HEADED NORTHEAST. THIS IS THE ONLY ROAD. WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT THERE EVENTUALLY. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE KID? NO WAY HE CAME FROM THE OLD MAN'S LOINS. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? HE'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH ASSHOLE. ARE YOU ACTUALLY ADMITTING YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE? WE'RE BOTH ASSHOLES. NO. DON'T DRAG ME INTO YOUR PERSONAL NIGHTMARE. I HAPPEN TO BE A VERY DECENT GUY. JUST BECAUSE A DRUNK ADMITS THAT HE'S A DRUNK, DOESN'T MAKE HIM ANY MORE SOBER. JUST TRYING TO BOND WITH YOU, LEO. I HEARD THAT MISERY LOVES COMPANY. IT WORKS THE SAME WITH MISERY OR WITHOUT. IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE COMPANY, ASSHOLE. MAKE SURE TO LEAVE ALL YOUR VALUABLES IN THE TRUCK. ONE VACANCY IN THIS ENTIRE PISS ANT TOWN? COME ON, WHAT IS THIS? A CONVENTION DESTINATION? I'VE SLEPT ON BATHROOM FLOORS THAT WERE BIGGER THAN THAT HOTEL ROOM. I HAD A CELL IN JUVY THAT WAS, LIKE, SIX BY SIX. WE USUALLY HAD TO DOUBLE UP IN A PLACE LIKE THAT.

THE BUREAU'S CLAIMING NO RESPONSIBILITY. HA, AND YOU BELIEVE THEM? I WORKED FOR THEM 10 YEARS. THEY'LL CONSIDER IT A HUGE FAILURE IF THEY DON'T BRING WILLS BACK ALIVE. WHOEVER KILLED RODRIGUEZ DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT WILLS. LET ME WORRY ABOUT IT, WILL YOU? OKAY, BUT WHILE YOU'RE WORRYING, GET OFF MY COMPUTER! IT TOOK ME A MONTH TO PUT IN THOSE MONEY TRANSFERS, AND YOU'RE GONNA CRASH IT PLAYING CARDS. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, IF THE FEDS DIDN'T KILL RODRIGUEZ, THEN WHO? IN THE WORLD RODRIGUEZ LIVES IN, I'M SURE THE LIST IS ENDLESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S NOT CONNECTED.

PUT YOUR WEAPONS ON THE BAR.YOU HEARD HIM. [SAM] WE THINK THE AMERICAN, KYLE WILLS, MAY BE HIDDEN DOWN HERE. AND YOU ASSUME I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT? NO. YOU HAVE NO MOTIVE. AT LEAST YOU ARE NOT A STUPID POLICEMAN. [MUMBLING] WHAT THEN?IF RODRIGUEZ WAS TO BRING HIM DOWN HERE, I'D ASSUME HE'D ASK FOR YOUR PERMISSION OUT OF RESPECT, MAYBE GOOD SENSE. RODRIGUEZ HAD NO RESPECT AND VERY LITTLE SENSE. HE WORKED FOR ME. HE WANTED TO BE ME. CAN YOU BLAME HIM? WOULD THE KIDNAPPERS BE DOWN HERE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING ABOUT THEM? IF THEY ARE HERE, IT IS BECAUSE RODRIGUEZ KNEW WHERE TO HIDE THEM, IN A PLACE WHERE I WOULD HAVE NO CONCERN. DOES THAT PLACE EXIST? IS THERE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T AFRAID OF YOU?TO KNOW ME IS TO BE AFRAID. IF THERE ARE WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES IN ANY DIRECTION, THEY KNOW ME. IS THERE A PLACE THAT'S OF NO CONCERN TO YOU? SIMPLE, A PLACE WHERE THE SOIL IS NOT FERTILE. I AM A FARMER, REMEMBER? WHAT ABOUT THE INDIAN LAND?DOUBTFUL. THEY HAVE THEIR HOLY PLACES, BUT THERE, THE INDIANS WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM BY NOW. MAYBE THE CANYONS. LISTEN, IF WILLS IS HERE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BRING MORE HEAT ON YOU THAN YOU CAN AFFORD. I WANT TO FIND HIM FIRST. I NEED YOUR HELP. EVEN IF I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, YOUR GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROVE IT. YOU'LL BE DROPPED OFF BACK AT YOUR HOTEL. IF YOU'RE NOT GONE IN 24 HOURS, YOU WILL DIE HERE. [SPEAKING SPANISH] AHH!

I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT! HEY, SAM! HEY, SAM, AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT ON YOUR WAY HOME, MAN. FINALLY GETTING A CHANCE TO MEET MY FAMILY HAS MEANT A LOT TO ME. WE AIN'T FAMILY! IF THERE'S NO MONEY INVOLVED IN THIS, WE NEVER MEET. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. I'M JUST GLAD TO MEET YOU GUYS. I JUST WISH I COULD'VE MET MY DAD TOO, MAN. LET ME BRING YOU UP TO SPEED ON YOUR FAMILY. YOUR DAD? AN ABUSIVE DRUNK AND A SEX ADDICT. FOUR KIDS, FOUR MOTHERS. ALL RIGHT... DID YOU AT LEAST GET A CHANCE TO MEET YOUR MOM? YEAH, STRIPPER.

IT'S THE SAME GUYS WHO KIDNAPPED WILLS. THEY KNOW RODRIGUEZ IS DEAD AND THEY SOMEHOW MADE THE CONNECTION. HOW DID THEY KNOW IT WAS US? 'CAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY MORONS WITH BULLS EYE'S ON OUR FOREHEADS. DO YOU STILL NEED HELP? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THESE MEN THAT WORKED WITH EDGAR, AMERICANS. THEY CAME LOOKING FOR YOU. THEY KILLED MY GRANDFATHER. OH, MAN...I KNOW EVERY TRAIL, ROAD AND CANYON FOR 100 MILES. WE'RE GONNA NEED GUNS. LEO, GET IN THE BACK. [THERESA] STOP HERE. WE'RE CLOSE. IT USED TO BE A WEAPONS DEPOT FOR THE MILITARY.

MY LIFE'S BEEN ABOUT MONEY... I HAD TROUBLE SEEING PAST IT. DON'T TELL ME. AND NOW YOU'RE WONDERING IF MONEY IS WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT, HUH? THAT'S CLICHED, MAN. BUT I'M WITH YOU, 'CAUSE THAT IS THE QUESTION. IS THE MONEY ENOUGH? I MEAN, IS ANYTHING LESS THAN BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF ENOUGH? BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING ABOUT BLOWING SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF. OH, BOY, IT IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH. IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME, COULD I SAY GOOD BYE TO MY FAMILY FIRST. WHAT, TELL 'EM YOU LOVE 'EM? THAT SORT OF NONSENSE. YES, PLEASE. WOW, THAT IS TOUCHING. YES. [EMPTY PISTOL CLICKING] [LAUGHING] RELAX, WILL YOU? I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOAD IT. NOT REALLY A GUN KIND OF GUY.

THAT WAS... KIND OF STUPID. YOU KNOW WHAT'S STUPID, LEO? THE WHOLE BONANZATHING. THAT'S STUPID. [DOUGLAS] WELL, YOU MUST HAVE CARED ABOUT HIM ONCE, A LONG TIME AGO. EDGAR WAS LIKE MY FATHER. HE PROTECTED ME FROM THE THINGS HE KNEW I WOULD NOT TOLERATE. YOU MEAN HE LIED TO YOU. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. WHEN I FOUND OUT THE TRUE NATURE OF WHAT HE DID, I LEFT, AGAIN, LIKE MY FATHER. WHAT IS IT YOUR FATHER DID? VERDUGO WORKED FOR HIM. HEY! HOW DO YOU GET THESE THINGS TO GO IF THEY DON'T WANT TO? THE GAS DEPOT IS OVER THE NEXT RISE, ABOUT A MILE. ALL RIGHT, WE REST NEAR HERE, AND WE WAIT FOR DARK. [♪♪] NOW, THAT'S ONE GORGEOUS WOMAN, AIN'T IT? DEFINITELY. HEY, TELL ME, LITTLE BROTHER. HOW DO YOU DO IT, HUH? WITH THE LADIES, I MEAN?

IF THE WOMAN SEEMS VERY GIVING, BECAUSE I'M ACUTELY ATTUNED INTO HER EVERY NEED. BUT, IN REALITY, IT'S SELFISHLY MOTIVATED. HUH... I GUESS THAT COULD WORK. LEO. STAY HERE WITH THERESA. ME AND THE KID ARE GOING TO LOOK AROUND. WAIT, WHY DO I HAVE TO STAY HERE? SHE'LL PROTECT YOU. OH, COME ON. ARE YOU FORGETTING? I'M THE ONE THAT SPEAKS SPANISH. I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO THEM.
