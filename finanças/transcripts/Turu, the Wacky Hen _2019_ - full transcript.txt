TURU, THE WACKY HEN Darn feather! I hope the wind takes it away! My girls, we're already at the fair! Attention, pretty hens! Take your position! Oh, yeah, my gorgeous, egg-laying hens, you make me earn money. Not you! Get to your place. You haven't even laid an egg and you're not pretty to look at. Oh, this hen... - Good morning! - Good morning. - Good morning, teacher. - Good morning. - Fruits! Fruits! Bananas! Apples! Oranges! - Good morning. Good morning. Good, inexpensive hens! Eat fresh eggs every day! - Hello, Isabel! You just look gorgeous! - Hello! - Good morning, teacher. - Good morning. Oh, thank you! Mrs. Isabel, I haven't seen around in town in a while. I have everything I need at my farm. I only come when I need something. Mrs. Isabel, I can offer you the best hens in the region! White, red-colored, and the most powerful egg-layers! I guarantee you'll find here what you're looking for. Oh, my... I see you have a good eye! Look the way she moves! What a beauty! She's on another level! She's a winner of contests! She's got pedigree! A deluxe hen! - You may pay by installments if you want. - No, thank you, I'm retired. - What about this one? - Oh! This excellent red-colored hen is very elegant and well designed. And she can lay at least 320 eggs a month. - Three hundred and twenty? - Approximately. Careful with that egg! - What about that one? - This? Yes, that one. Yes, of course. This hen has no parallel! Despite her ugly looks, she's a great egg-layer. It's true she isn't as elegant as the others, but you want her to lay eggs, am I right? - What's her name? - As she has a special personality, I've called her Turuleca. Turuleca... I'm taking her. - Bye! - Bye-bye. - Good morning, teacher! - Good morning. The astounding Daedalus Circus is here! Touring towards the Big City. Don't miss on this long-expected debut! Magicians, clowns, acrobats, and the most amazing trapeze artists! The Icarus! Goodbye! - Good morning. - Good morning. Vicente! Let's go! Have a nice day. Bye, Isabel. Bye. When I quit teaching music, I moved to the countryside. My farm is like my little piece of paradise. I'm sure you're going to love it. And you'll have the henhouse all to yourself. They are Melody, Rhythm, and Beat. From now on, she's going to live with us at the farm. She's called Turuleca. Look, this is your new home. It's a little old, but I'll fix it for you. You were really hungry, weren't you? Very well. Now, lay some eggs. What? - Cocoricó Hens. - Hello, Mr. Cocoricó. The hen you sold me hasn't laid one single egg. What are you saying? All my hens are excellent egg-layers! Maybe she doesn't like my place? In that case, you can only make an exchange. - Would you take Turuleca away? - Hens are like this, either they work or they don't. I won't give up this easily. - I must be able to help her somehow. - I can't guarantee it will work, but a calm environment, good light, and music may do wonders. Of course! "On my block I have a... neighbor and a hen with strange behavior, and she looks like she came out of a can of tuna. Boney legs and skinny tummy, so she's always really hungry, and she always has her feathers in a tangle." Turu, look the song I've written for you! It's for you. Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying... Turu? Turuleca! Shortly, the train to Port Hope will make its arrival. And now, this is for our friend Vicente, the rooster of the station of Harmony Ville, the king of hens, the one who wins all their hearts, for him, this reggaeton rooster! He loves to cumbia, he likes to rock Bring on merengue or dance hip hop He moves to mambo and cha cha cha Crazy about the cumbias, even likes ska Throw on bachata, he can feel the beat Gangnam style, and groovin' with his feet Pop, Calypso, trap, Hokey Pokey Tango, flamenco, he looks like a turkey - Oh, oh, oh, oh - Anything at all to swing and sway you - Oh, oh, oh, oh - All he wants to do is dance with you - Oh, oh, oh, oh - And when he dances a reggaeton ton - Oh, oh, oh, oh - His heart goes, his heart goes boom-boom My rooster, cock-a-doodle-do Dance a conga, zumba, and ranchera Dances the polka, tarantela Salsa, merengue, lots of lambada He's movin', he's movin', don't look now Disco-dance, he knows all the moves He doesn't care, he breaks all the rules Dancing rooster never gonna stop A little hen is in his cock-a-doodle heart - Oh, oh, oh, oh - Anything at all to swing and sway you - Oh, oh, oh, oh - All he wants to do is dance with you - Oh, oh, oh, oh - And when he dances a reggaeton ton - Oh, oh, oh, oh - His heart goes, his heart goes boom-boom Vicente! Get to your post! Vicente... What's the matter with you? Come on, Vicente! My little one! Don't be afraid, I'm here. It's very dangerous for you to be alone outside the farm. I never had an animal run away. I believed you were happy living there, but perhaps I was wrong. I know you've tried really hard to lay eggs and you haven't succeeded, but you shouldn't give up. I am going to help you. It may be a somewhat extravagant idea, but I think music is a miracle worker. You'll see. I haven't played the piano in years. Very well. I hope you like it. Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying one She's laying two She's laying three Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying four She's laying five She's laying six Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying seven Laying eight, laying nine Where, oh, where could she be hiding? In a corner still deciding If she's going to make it ten What is that? Let's find out. - "She's laying two, she's laying..." - Oh! "Three!" "She's laying three." Three! Three! Three! My name is Isabel. My name is... Isabel! Very well, but no. I am Isabel. You are Turuleca. Turuleca... - Very well! - You, Isabel. It's glorious! Marvelous! A miracle! You understand me, right? If you can sing, that means you can learn to speak! - Good morning, Mrs. Isabel! - Good morning. We've known each other for many years, and I think that this special hen I sold you, according to you, hasn't met your egg-laying expectations. So, in exchange for this useless animal, - plus a reasonable extra amount... - Yeah, but... I will give you this amazing egg-laying hen. Egg-laying hen? - No, certainly not. My hen can... - She can lay eggs? She can live at my farm. Thank you for your courtesy. Goodbye. Alright, bye then... Thank you. I'd never exchange you, not for anything in the world. Listen closely: "foot". - Believe in me, in what I say - Now you. - "Foot". - I look at you and feel this way My heart just wants to fly so high So take my hand, let's touch the sky You changed a world I thought I knew And so I wrote this song for you So come with me, 'cos if we try - Together we can learn to fly - Together we can learn to fly It's just amazing It's so incredible It's unbelievable It's oh-so beautiful And to me it's plain to see From now on it's you and me 'Cos every day Will be you and me together Every day, me and you are friends forever - "Bicycle". - "Bicycle". - "Circus". - "Circus". - "Rooster". - Vicente. It's just amazing It's so incredible It's unbelievable It's oh-so beautiful And to me it's plain to see From now on it's you and me 'Cos every day Will be you and me together Every day, me and you are friends forever 'Cos every day Will be you and me together Every day, me and you are friends forever In any kind of weather No! Isabel! Are you all right? You scared me. I thought... Where am I? What happened? Who are you? This one, it's this one, and this, and this. - Emergency service. How may I help you? -I need a doctor! My friend doesn't remember anything. It's an emergency! There she is! She's conscious, but we need to take her now to the hospital at the Big City. Come on. The Big City? Isa... Isabel! Isabel! Isabel... Don't miss on the last shows of Daedalus Circus - before it leaves for the Big City! - The Big City? Last shows before it goes to the Big City! The Big City! Bye! I'll be back soon! Don't miss... Watch out, Dad, the hen! - I can't find her anywhere! - Surely, she's safe. They are smarter than we think. Let's go, son. Alright, Dad. Let's go. Bye! I'll catch you! I'll catch you! - Antonio! - I'll be right there, Hipólita. I'll catch you! I'll catch you! Are you ready, Matías? Now! Bravo! That's perfect, Matías, but let's try one more somersault. Alright, Lucía. Son, it's better if you keep the drum roll going - until they finish. - Understood. Stop that tin-can noise right now! What do you practice for if nobody comes to your shows? - Rudy! - Sorry, Mr. Tramas. Armando, I'm sure when we get to the Big City, we will succeed. Then, we'd go on a world tour, and I will have enough money to pay you what I owe. Stop dreaming, Antonio. You'll never make it to the Big City. What? Time's over. Tomorrow, you should start paying your debts. If you are late, even by one day, the circus will be mine. You said you wanted to help me so I don't lose my circus! Your circus? That's your problem, your memory is failing. Nobody comes see you. Not even in this scruffy towns. You really think you'll go on a world tour some day? Don't waste your time and start packing. Why is he doing this? I don't understand. Who's there? Watch out! No! Come on! Try to come my way! Try to take my hand! That was so cool! Thank you. You're welcome. Wait, what? Can you speak? - I'm not crazy, I heard you. - Yes, I speak. No, this can't be. It can't be true. Oh, yeah, speak again. Say something. I don't know what to say. This is nuts! Do you realize that animals can't talk? - You're an animal and you can talk, right? - You're amazing! I have to tell Lucía... my dad... everyone! Lucía! - Lucía! - Wait! Could you take me to the Big City? I don't think we're going there. My dad is about to lose the circus. - And how am I going to find Isabel? - Is Isabel another talking hen? No, she's like you. Well, a little older. I also wish things to be different, but people don't care about circuses anymore. If you had a larger audience, could you save it? Well, I think... No, it's nothing. - Go on, say it. - What if I perform at the circus? - Sure! That'd be great! - You really think so? No, that can't be. We don't have animals in our circus. That'd be cruel. They can't decide whether they want to perform on our show or not. That's true. But I can decide for myself. I want to perform at the circus, and that's good for both of us, right? That's perfect, I can picture it! Imagine this: the magician comes out, music, mystery, he takes you out of a hat, he hypnotizes you, and you start talking. So cool! No, that would be so embarrassing. No? Otherwise, you could... uhm... And you, can you think of something? What are you doing? Quand il me prend dans ses bras Il me parle tout bas Je vois la vie en rose Don't blame the night Don't blame the beach Don't blame the rain I guess you don't love me Don't blame the night Don't blame the beach Don't blame the rain I guess you don't love me Bravo! This will be the coolest act ever! She's Lucía, my best friend. She's going to be our new star! Turuleca. Son, if I don't pay off my debts, Trama will take the circus. It's not the right time to try a new act, it's insane. Dad, this is something different, never seen before. No matter how original it is, it won't prevent us from losing the circus. - There's another possibility. - Only a miracle can save us. Matías has brought that miracle. Come on, Turu. Please. Get out of my way, ugly bird! Let me see... Three, six, ten, 15 tickets sold! That's for your first show. Not bad. For the second show you haven't sold any. As far as I can see, there's no more people waiting to buy, right, Rudy? - Nobody. - I've dreamed of this moment since the day your father kicked me out of the circus. It's all just a matter of being patient. Finally, the day has come. I won't allow it! Darn ugly bird! - Rudy! - Sorry, Mr. Tramas. Dad, I need you to give me a chance. Son, you are the circus' musician, and you do it really well, - but you've never performed on your own. - There's always a first time. - Have you practiced it well? - More or less. But don't worry, I'll have the DJ set up and running in a couple of hours. Uhm, we could start with the trapeze act. That would give them a little more time. - No, no way. - You have to trust me! I trust you, but I'm not going to indulge you. This is not just a whim, you have to trust me. Is she a part of your act? A hen? The audience is going to laugh at you. - And we don't use animals in our circus. - Antonio, this isn't any animal. She can... Come on, Matías, you tell him. I can explain it to him. What is this? Let me see, you've hidden something here, right? Nice trick. There's nothing... It's a real hen! Very well! Go on, Matías, get your DJ table ready. Lucía, tell your parents the Icarus are coming out first. And I have to figure out how I am going to present this. Hurry up, time's running out! Thank you! Thank you! - Bravo, bravo. - Bravo! Bravo! Excellent! Come on, everyone in position! Let's go. Up. Now. Hipólita! The time has come to introduce a unique, original act. What you're about to see is magic, but there's no trick. It may look impossible, but it is real. - Up! Up! - Down! Down! Wow! Lucía, upwards. - Come on, push! - I'm pushing! What is that? Now. This can't be happening... - Matías, start already! Come on! - Yeah... My name is DJ M, and she is Turuleca! She is Turuleca! Turu! Turuleca! Don't worry, my little girl, you can do it. Now, go get them! Dance to the rhythm And the beat of Turuleca Bounce to the bass and the beat That's really mega - Sway to the flow and the beat of Turuleca -She has flow! Hey, Turuleca! Aaaaay! Dance to the rhythm And the beat of Turuleca Let your feet be the guide To the beat that's really mega Sway to the flow and the beat of Turuleca Hey, Turuleca! Aaaaay! Turuleca shines in any kind of weather With her big green eyes And yellow feathers With a long neck and no feathers She just wobbles You'll love her in an instant That I promise Turuleca has a rhythm that's outrageous Really makes you move 'cos it's contagious Let the music be your guide And really feel it And dance away like you mean it Dance to the rhythm And the beat of Turuleca Bounce to the bass and the beat That's really mega Sway to the flow and the beat of Turuleca Hey, Turuleca! Aaaaay! Turuleca has a rhythm that's outrageous Really makes you move 'cos it's contagious Let the music be your guide And really feel it And dance away like you mean it Dance to the rhythm And the beat of Turuleca Let your feet be the guide to the beat That's really mega Sway to the flow and the beat of Turuleca Hey, Turuleca! Aaaaay! Hey, Turuleca! - Whoo! - Thank you. Great! Whoo! - We made it! - We made it! That's it! Yeah! - I knew it! I knew it! - Thanks a lot! - Great! - Bravo! - Let's go! - Thank you! That's my son! And she is Turuleca! Bravo! That was a fabulous performance. - Marvelous, extraordinary! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot. One second, please. Let's welcome into our big circus family with a big hand - this prodigy of nature called Turuleca! - Bravo! - Great! - Celebration! - Bravo! - Well done, son! I must admit the new act has surprised me, with the DJ and the hen, "Turuleta". - It's Turuleca. - Alright, "Turuleta". In three hours, exactly at midnight, the circus will be mine. Those of you who want to be a part of Tramas Circus will be welcomed. - Especially "Turuleta". - Turuleca! Don't even think about it, Tramas! The only actually valuable thing in this circus is you. With me, you will know glory, dear Turuleca. - Finally he said it right. - Turu, it's not the time. I don't know how to tell you how sorry I am. Desperate to save the circus, I made some wrong choices. Each of you is free to do as you see fit. I am not giving up! We still have one more show! It's pointless, Turu. We haven't sold one ticket. - We have... - ...failed. Failure is not doing the show! We have to accept it. Tramas, the big tent, the stage, the wagons... are yours. But not the circus! You are the circus, and I too. I need to go to the Big City, and I want to go with Daedalus Circus. We still have one more chance. We must try. Bravo! Bravo! Sorry to interrupt... but know that I am giving the order to bring down the big tent. And I'm doing it with all of you inside if necessary. You will have to wait. It's not midnight yet. It's ridiculous. Nobody will come. If that happens, we'll do the best performance in the history of circus! Just for ourselves. You're naive, dumb, useless, and incompetent. Just like any idealist. Hey, we need to do the second show! The spectators went out and told the whole town about what they've seen. Look. - Wow! - Marvelous! And now they all have come asking to see Turuleca! I think we'll be doing two more shows! That's great! - Rudy! - Sorry, Mr. Tramas. - Two tickets! - Coming. - Two in the stalls, please. - Two in the main floor. Another one here. - Give me three. - Here they are. Another one. Very well, you have made your first payment, but it's not enough, you still owe me a lot of money. I know. From now on, things are going to be different. You're always the optimist, Antonio. I wouldn't feel so confident if my future depended on a hen. Turuleca! Turuleca! Turuleca! Turuleca! Step aside. Let's go. Enjoy the little hen because very soon she'll be mine. No matter how. Hold her. Now. - Come on, Matías, climb. - I'm coming up. Repeat after me: "I'm not afraid of heights." - "I'm not afraid of heights." - "I'm not afraid of heights." - Wow! A shooting star! - Let's make three wishes. That our circus becomes the most famous in the world. Becoming a great trapeze artist. Finding Isabel. From now on, our lives are going to change forever. - Success, fame... - The Big City. Then, Paris, Madrid, London, New York... - The world at our feet. - Can you imagine that, Turuleca? Everyone will want to see you, applaud you, and cheer your name. I love it! What will Isabel say when she finds out? - She'll be really happy. - And proud. I hope so. - And what will Vicente think? - Vicente is your... Yes... No, I don't know. I think so. Is he a rooster? I have to believe it's for a reason That some things are just meant to be Even if the road is never-ending I want you to be next to me No matter how many clouds that gather And rain, they rain on me And even when I still believe Sometimes I think it's not to be If you ever forgot me If still you miss me Tell me that it was real That you trust me So baby light the way And guide me to your loving glow I need to hear you heart that's beating Beating next to me And I'm going to find you No matter how far I'll cross every ocean Wherever you are Welcome to the greatest circus of all time! The fabulous Tramas Circus! And the great Rudy! Sorry, Mr. Tramas. - It's pretty, isn't it, Rudy? - Yes, boss. I already have the largest zoo in the world, 23 theaters, forty-eight cinemas, and three TV channels. - And one dog cleaner's! - Exactly. But nothing matters more than destroying Daedalus Circus and transforming it into the marvelous... - Tramas Circus. - That's it! And do you know why? No, why? I used to be the great contortionist and I could do incredible things. However, ignorant people in the crowd cheered Antonio more and more. He only did a clumsy act keeping his balance on top of 50 chairs. - Fifty chairs? - One day, he had an unlucky accident and that brought his career to an end. Despite the lack of evidence, Antonio's father kicked me out of the circus. Poor guy, you were innocent and... - Rudy! - Yeah, sure, sure. This is the time to change our strategy. We need to prevent them from ever getting to the Big City. For this, we'll go after that little hen. Without her, Daedalus Circus is doomed. Turuleca is more valuable than all my wealth put together. Nothing's easier than stealing a hen. We love you! You're the best! Turuleca! - Good luck! - Bravo! - But... But... - Bye! Welcome! Thank you! - Here! - Give me one! HARMONY VILLE FROM A FARM TO STARDOM Darn my luck! - Ta-dah! - A classic style... a heavy-metal style... Ta-dah! - Here! Look to your right! - A picture! - A picture, please! - Thank you. Turuleca will perform today at the Big City and the anticipation is huge! - Thousands of fans... - Come on, Isabel, get to bed. It's too late to be watching TV. Poor thing, every passing day, she gets worse... - Rudy, can you hear me? - Loud and clear. Very well, let's put the plan in motion. Wait, boss, somebody is coming. - I will give you the go-ahead. - Copy. - Is everything ready? - I only have to take my DJ turntable. Very well, hurry up, we need to be on our way to the Big City before midnight. - Boss? - Yes, I'm listening. - The coast is clear. - Now it's the time. Let my plan begin. Hello, little hen. Let's go! The Big City awaits us! Is everything all right, boss? Though you can't believe it It's closer than we see it It only looks far away Sometimes we only worry We're always in a hurry So look around and smile on the way You don't need a sky to learn how to fly Or wish on a star to follow your dreams Over and beyond I know I'll reach you someday Far beyond Tell me what I'm feeling If this feeling is love And never let it go away Over and beyond I know the wind will take me Far beyond Only time will tell us If we get very far But I trust in you You can trust in me Spread your wings and begin to fly Spread your wings and fly, so high Over and beyond I know I'll reach you someday Far beyond Tell me what I'm feeling If this feeling is love I'll never let you go away Turuleca! Turuleca! We want Turuleca! - Hello! - Hello, little one. Pepito! Mr. Pepito! Hey! - Hi, Mr. Pepito! - Hi, Mr. José! - Have you driven down my block today? - Down you block I surely drove! - Did you see my grandma? - Your grandma I did see! - Bye, Mr. Pepito! - Bye, Mr. José! - Hi, Mr. Pepito! - Hi, Mr. José! - Have you driven down my block today? - Down you block I surely drove! - Did you see my grandma? - Your grandma I did see! - Bye, Mr. Pepito! - Bye, Mr. José! - Hi, Mr. Pepito! - Hi, Mr. José! - Have you driven down my block today? - Down you block I surely drove! - Did you see my grandma? - Your grandma I did see! - Bye, Mr. Pepito! - Bye, Mr. José! - Dad, we didn't even try! - Now it can't be. - But I gave her my word! - Our only concern must be our first night. Turu needs us to find Isabel. She's kept her end of the bargain. Son, without Turuleca, Daedalus Circus is doomed to fail. - She's not leaving, understood? - But where's the problem? Turuleca can find Isabel and keep performing in the circus. And what if it isn't like that and she goes back to the farm? We can kiss our circus and our dreams goodbye. Are you willing to lose Turu? Turu, do you understand me? I can speak like you, but I don't understand you! - Aren't you happy here? - I didn't say that. You're a circus star. You don't belong to Isabel anymore. I belong to no one. Why do humans think they own everything? Don't worry about me, I can manage on my own. Matías, come! We are doing an interview for TV. They want to meet the DJ kid! Wow... Oh, my... Turuleca! Turuleca! Turuleca! Turuleca! Turuleca! Isabel, where are you? Very well, little hen. From now on, we only need to wait for the right time. Meanwhile, I want you to watch their every move. - Yes, boss. - This time, Turuleca will be mine or she'll depart this life. - Turuleca! - Turuleca! - Turuleca! - Calm down! Quiet! - See you later! - Hello! Turu! - See you later! - See you later! - Remember, with the third drum roll... - Lucía! Come! Come! Get going. I'll be with you in a second. Don't be late. We need to change for the rehearsal. Yes, Mom. It will only be a second. - What's the matter? - Turuleca is gone. What? - Have you seen her? - No. Maybe she left? Where? That's not possible. Look! What's she doing up there? - Let's go! - No, Matías. Surely, she's not right. - I know, and I feel responsible. - You have to go with her. Tell my father that Turu isn't all right and it's better if she doesn't rehearse. - She needs to rest for the show. - But, Matías... Please, I don't want him to worry. Everything's going to be all right. Matías! "I'm not afraid of heights." Thank you. I'm not afraid of heights. I'm not afraid of heights. - Turu! What are you doing up here? - I'm looking for Isabel. That's crazy. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. I see that. The city is huge. I'm never going to find Isabel. She loved me when I was a common hen and nobody else did. But everything is different now. I know who I am. And I will sing when I feel like it, and not for the applause. I will lay eggs only if I want to, and if I don't, what does it matter? That's all very well, isn't it? But I need to see her, more than ever, - and I don't think it'll be possible. - You've also changed my life. I will always be thankful. I love you very much. And I love you, and it makes me happy. I used to know a young guy who was always very sad. Every day, he sat gloomily on a riverbank. He thought there was no answer to his problems. But suddenly, something unexpected happened. A talking and singing hen showed up! - Come. - Okay. Boss, come! Something strange is going on. That's the ambulance that took Isabel! Turu, there isn't only one. It may not be. You're right. But what if it is? What about the first show? This is your chance. This is what you've come here for. Yes, I know. But I won't be able to catch up with it. - Look! - Good idea! - I'm coming with you! - No, Matías. This is your place. The show must go on. Goodbye. Goodbye. Great! Yeah! You can do it, Turu! Yeah! Are you crazy? Where do you think you're going? Faster, Rudy! Come on! I got you! Make way. Hey! I'm here! Rudy! Are you dumb? Sorry, Mr. Tramas. Bye-bye! - So? Where's Turuleca? - She went looking for Isabel. What? What about the show? We must tell your father! Come look! "Vicente." He's Turuleca's boyfriend. Are you all right? How did he get here? I can't understand you very well, but it must have been quite an adventure. I know you've come for Turuleca, but she isn't here. But she's coming back. Matías, we need to tell the others that Turuleca's gone. The show is about to begin! True. We cannot go on stage without Turuleca. Unless we... Would you be up for it? Hello. I want to make an appointment for a test. - Can I see your medical card? - Sure. One second. It must be around here... This is it. Good morning, José. - Here, some clean towels. - Thank you. May I, Teresa? I'll leave the towels under your bed. Good morning, Isabel. I don't know why I bother talking to her. Poor woman, she doesn't even know where she is. Hello, dear friend! I came to visit you! You look very well... quite well. I have so much to tell you. Where do I start? You won't believe it. I'm an artist with a circus! And I became friends with Matías, Lucía, and... I still haven't laid a single egg. But who cares? I'm still a hen, am I not? Please, say something. Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying one, she's laying two She's laying three Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying four, she's laying five She's laying six Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying seven, laying eight Laying nine Where, oh, where could she be hiding? In a corner still deciding If she's going to make it ten That was great! - Turu! - Isabel! I have so much to tell you! I want to hear it all. But before that, I need your help. Look, I have a ticket! There are so many people! We're about to start! - We go on stage in five minutes! - We're coming! Are you done? No, Matías, this isn't easy. And now? Are you done yet? We're coming, Mom! - Son, how is Turuleca? - Uhm... It was nothing! She's just anxious about the premiere. - I'd like to greet her before the show. - But... Where's Turuleca? She's in the restroom. Alright. I'll wait. Don't worry, Dad. I'll tell her you came by. Last call! Come on, let's start! Hurry up, Matías, go get changed. Tonight will be unforgettable! At last, our hardships will be over.

And now, everyone, it's time to sing! On my block I have a neighbor And a hen with strange behavior And she looks like she came Out of a can of tuna Bony legs and skinny tummy So she's always really hungry And she always has Her feathers in a tangle She lays her eggs under the carpet Kitchen sink and in the garden But she'll never think To lay them in the coop There's a hen called Turuleca She really is one of a kind She's a hen called Turuleca! She will always blow your mind Come on, everyone! I can't hear you! Hey, come closer! Turu, Vicente, everyone, come here! It's about to start! Laying eggs is Turuleca - She's laying one - One! Two! Three! Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying... Four! Five! Six! Laying eggs is Turuleca She's laying... Seven! Eight! - Nine! - Where, oh, where could she be hiding? In a corner still deciding - If she's going to make it... - Ten! Vicente, he's just like you. Everyone has got their talents, right? THE END
