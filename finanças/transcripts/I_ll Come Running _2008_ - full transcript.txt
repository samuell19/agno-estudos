It's your country, it's in bad taste. Yeah, I thought The Simpsons had prepared me for it, but no way. Wait-- so we're too much like The Simpsons? No, you're more like not enough... Then you'd be funny. [scoffs] Well, you should've seen us in season four. Ever since then we've been coasting on our rep. [speaking Danish] No, it wasn't funny? It wasn't really funny, was it? [music playing in restaurant] [Waitress] What's the word? You making fun of me? Why, is it cutting into my tip? No... I just think it's rude to make fun of people when you haven't been properly introduced. So properly introduce yourself. [men laugh] What are you...? It's my country, my language. The same rule applies when you come to Denmark? -I'm not gonna go to Denmark. -You promise? No, but seriously, what did he say about me? He said look at you and laugh... [whispers] No... Asshole. ...Like he had said something mean. -Really clever. -[Pelle] Thanks. Do you have anything, like, before the day after tomorrow? No, no, no, no... Not Dallas. Okay, how much is that gonna be? I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that. Honey, if you could take your call right outside, that'd be great, all right? -Of course, miss. -Thank you, thank you. It's, it's Pelle Juul. [curtain jangles] J-U-U-L. So, if I'm stuck, what should I do with my day? [all speaking Danish] [ignition starts, engine revs] [music playing on radio] [Young woman] Shut up. Happy birthday. [Young man] Support our teenage drinking program? Oh, no, I'm sorry, I... Maybe you know where this is? Oh, the hostel? You'll completely get your shit stolen, dude. [Young man 2] I don't think there's a hostel in Austin. Dude, I don't even know what this is a map of... I don't know. -Where'd you get this map? -Is there a hostel here? [Woman] It's on your right. There's a coffee shop. It's very simple. Good luck! "A coffee shop"? -You're... -Shh-shh-shh. Where are you sending him? You're sending him to the Church of Scientology? -You think that's funny? -Shh, shh-- they have beds! -You think that's hilarious, don't you? -They have beds. [music plays] [Woman] Oh, hey, we're closed. Ooh, already? Yeah, sorry. No, that's okay, thanks. [door squeaks open] [Waitress] Hey, Simpsons... We're closed. -Hey, yeah, yeah, she told me. -Yeah. You know, this isn't the only Mexican joint in town. No, but you know... I can't find my way. [Waitress] Yeah, and you know, three Mexican martinis and you don't know what planet you're on. -Drunk. -Oh, he's coming with us. Hey, there's this, um, party if you want to come too? You know, you can sober up there. -Um, did somebody just bust a move? -No... I could've sworn somebody busted a move. He's a lost puppy. I'm just helping him out. -[laughs] Is that what you call it? -Yeah. Are you coming or not? -[laughter and party music] -[indistinct conversations] Can I have a cigarette? The whole thing, "Please, dear God, just say it's a joke, say it's a joke, he's gonna start laughing any minute." No, dead serious, he fucking answers the phone-- -What-- who is this for? -[Man] Me. I don't know... I still went home with him. [laughs] I figured the worst that could possibly happen was bad sex, and fuck it, that's always a good story. [Man] Yeah, the world's a little less interesting since you got off the market, Tessie. Yeah, like you'd have a shot either way, Karim. [Man] So was it good sex or a good story? Uh, it was a... a good story, but not for virgin ears. [all laugh mockingly] Weak... Weak, weak, weak. -[All] Cheers! -[glasses clink] [Karim] To good stories! [Tess] To turning 18. [Pelle] This is a funny way to sober me up, Lisa. [Karim] Oh, she wants you good and wrecked to keep you in line, man. Yeah, well, we've all seen the leash boss lady keeps you on. [Karim] Oh! That woman's not gonna stop running that restaurant to give birth. -[Tess laughs] -Man alive! She'd have me breast-feeding if she could figure out how. [Man] That's what you get for marrying the boss lady. Oh, poor, poor, poor Karim. [Pelle] I gotta go to the hostel, seriously. Man, you're gonna get your shit stolen. -Yeah, I know, it's... -[Tess] No, no, no, no! He should stay with us. -Milhouse... you can have my room. -What? -What? Marge, no, I couldn't. -[all talking at once] No, too late, already done. I'm staying with that asshole tonight anyway. No, the asshole is staying with us because you've got a breakfast shift, remember? -Mm-mm. -Remember? Mm-mm. I don't remember. Poopie! -[Man 2] How you doing? -Good. You must be that asshole. Yes, I am. Milhouse, this is my brother Eddie. They're calling me Milhouse. Dude, you got off easy. Yeah, these girls got names for everybody. Yeah? What do you two call me? I don't know... Carl? [laughter] I'm sorry. -Snap. -[Tess] We're out of here. [kiss] -No-- where are you going? -I just got here. Bitch! -[Eddie] See you at home, Vee! -Later, poopie. [Vee] You know the chair. It's like, orange, it's kind of puffy and... Seriously, you do not have to carry this. Oh, oh, and it has, like, these little legs. What are you talking about? Or we can look in the catalog, you know, then you can help me pronounce the name of the chair, 'cause I don't get it. It has, like, eight Ls in it or something. What is it with you and Ikea? [laughs] Do you have no national pride? Hey, Ikea is not Danish, it's Swedish. That's something completely different. What's in here, bricks? -I got it. -I'll be right back. [gasps] These bastards... -They covered my tag. -[both scoff] -You got my back, right? -Yes! -Keep an eye out for Chief Wiggum. -Chief... Chief Wiggum? -Watch out for the cops? -Ooh, yes, right. Mr. Chief Wiggum. Chief Wiggum. Man, I don't think I've ever met someone so into Simpsons. -I don't know, I don't really watch it anymore. -Yeah? Me neither. -Can you look out for me? -I'm looking out for you. [whistles] "Market forces made me do it." Yeah, that's one of mine. [marker squeaking] Really? Is that supposed to be political? [chuckles] See if I buy anything from Ikea. I'm totally boycotting. [crickets chirping] Thank you. [chuckles] I like this. [chucking] Hi... Okay, good night, Milhouse. Good night, Lisa. Oh, and Lisa? Um... Thanks. Good night. Good night. [indistinct music playing in other room] [sighs deeply] Fuck it. -Hey. -Oh, hi. -Hey. -Hey. Hi. [chuckles] [chuckles] So, I, uh... I guess you came to say good night. -Yes. -All right. You know, this kind of awkwardness gets points for style. -I guess. -Yeah. Now, that's a good boy. My hair, my hair... Oh, I'm sorry. [both panting and laughing] This is retarded! [music continues] [both chuckle] [Man] ♪ ...Say there's a place where I should be sleeping ♪ ♪ She said, all my... [music fades] [Vee] Wait, um, there's a... [both chuckle] [music plays] [music plays] If you do that again... I'm gonna break your fucking hand. Oh, well... I guess I won't be making your breakfast. What? Wait, wait-- you're gonna be making me breakfast? Yeah. [whistling] Hey! No ugly, naked men running around my house. It didn't seem to bother you last night. Last night is not this morning. Oh. Hmm. All for you, my delicate flower. [both chuckle, Pelle whistles] [speaking Danish] [continues whistling] [laughs] -Hi. -Hi. Hi. Yeah, I was gonna make breakfast. So was my bed comfortable? Uh... So when did you get in? We didn't hear you. -I didn't want to wake you kids. -No, you didn't. Hey... Do you want this? I think you want this. -Oh, yeah. -[laughs] Thanks. [laughing] Oh, nice. I should've known you're a fan. Those bitches are hot. -Yeah, well, their shirt sure is. -[laughter] Oh, my God. I love your roommate. -Tessie? -Yes? -Leave him alone. -No, what? We were just... We were talking about bands. We need breakfast tacos. No, but he's cooking! No, don't come back without the chorizo. But he was gonna go, like, all Martha Stewart and shit. Bye. All right, all right. [music plays] Whoa...! -I have to go to work... -Oh, no, no, no. And Tessie's gonna come back... -Yes, but I can be quick. -Oh, like last night. Oh, no, not exactly like last night. Mm... [music plays] [chuckles] I'm not even gonna ask. [music plays] [Woman] We're gonna see Grandpa at the game. [Pelle and Vee laughing] [Tess] You're welcome. -[Young man] Yo, right here. -No, no, no, hello! Not... Are you tailgating on my lawn? [laughs] What was that thing you said about ugly, naked dudes running around your apartment? [laughs] No, no, really, you convinced me, you don't have to beg-- here. -I'm not trying to convince you. -Shh-shh-shh. I wasn't even going... You and your magic fingers can stay... Unless you have something better to do. Not at all. Where you going, where you going? Some of us have to work and I'm already late. Well, call in-- call in sick. Dude, we're not all on vacation. Oh, but... But I can stay here. -Well, you can stay here tonight, but you're gonna have to fend for yourself. -I can do that. No, no, no, no... No... Where do you send a tourist around here? Where do I go to buy a gun? Or see a hangin'? Where are the cowboy battlefields? What the fuck is a cowboy battlefield? I don't know. Okay, all right. I'll take off work... if you shave that crap off your face. I'll look stupid if I shave. You'll be at the cowboy battlefields if you don't. [grunts] I'm not touching a hair until you're on the phone with your boss. Is Karim there, or do I have to talk to boss lady? [groans] [coughs] No, I'm sick. [coughs] Whatever, whatever, whatever, okay? [mouthing words] Hey... Yeah... Yeah. Hey, tell 'em how many times you threw up. Um... Yeah, I... And the nosebleed, tell them about the nosebleed. [mouthing words] Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have... And the rash, don't forget the rash. [groans] Well, I don't know what I'm doing today, but I'm definitely not hanging out with you. You wanted me to shave. Oh, I did... But I didn't know that you were gonna look 12 years old. I mean, really, in America, there's laws about where you can't have sex with little boys. Come on, feel this face. No, quit it! I'm serious! You're laughing! I'm serious and I'm laughing. I shouldn't have messed with your phone call. I could have totally lost my job. [sighs] -[chuckles] -You think I look more like him now, Lisa? Milhouse? -It's quite shocking, actually. -[both laugh] Do you remember that one where Lisa sees into the future and she's getting married and the night before the wedding, she's trying on her dress with Marge, and she goes, "Well, Mom, I don't think I should be wearing white." [laughing] And Marge says... "Milhouse doesn't count." "Milhouse doesn't count." That's so awesome. You don't think about cartoon characters growing up, not in that way, anyway. It's one of the most truthful family scenes ever seen on television, and it's in a cartoon. This isn't your lead-in to tell me about your family, is it? No. -So why are you going home, anyway? Really. -What-- Oh, come on, I don't believe that shit about the Alamo made you do it. No... Ah... No, I'm, uh... I'm running out of money, and-- Why are you lying to me? There's really no reason to lie. Well, it's hard to explain. [clears throat] I, um... You know, I've... I want a home, but I don't wanna go home. You know, basically, I'm just sick of being a tourist. For a long time, I was on this TV show where we would travel around the world-- -Oh, you didn't tell me I was getting celebrity nookie. Oh! [laughs] Well... Danish kid show celebrity nookie. Um, but we would go to, we would go all over the world and visit poor countries and do public service projects and see if we made any sort of impact-- How old were you? I was 15, 16. It's for kids. But, no, it could get intense. Like this one show we did, we were in Africa, and I helped a man die. He had AIDS, and there was basically nothing we could do about it, so I was just giving him water and helping him, you know, his family, his wife, his kids, his village prepare for his death. And the whole time they had me telling him that everything would be fine if he just drank more water or got more sleep. You know, I was lying to make them feel better. Mm. Shit, oh, I'm sorry. [laughs] No, I mean, it's okay. Fuck, you know? Yeah. It's weird. I don't know, I feel like I get it, though. It's like, you get to travel the world, but wherever you go, you have to be really patronizing, you know? What do you mean? Well, like the whole thing about rich white kids from really wealthy countries and they go to find these very poor dark people and help them find their way out of the misery of their lives. I mean, for a TV show, it's really fucked up actually, like if you think about it. No, no, no, no, no, we were helping people. We were encouraging kids to help people. -Mm. -We were trying to-- what? I'm just saying as Americans, when we do that, people think that we're Satan. That's maybe because America usually helps people out by bombing the shit out of their countries. Nobody said anything about bombing anybody. -Oh, come on! -I don't, I don't do that! Let's just... Let's just change the subject, okay? What, your political graffiti is scaring the shit out of your government? Fuck you. And clean that shit off your face, you fucking asshole. Hey, hey! I'm-- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. What is this? It's the Oklahoma game. -Do you have a camera? -Yeah. -[music plays] -Whoo! On today's episode of Save a Primitive Culture and Feel Better About Yourself, we discuss the rituals and romance of Texas football. [kids shouting] Even though this sport may seem really wholesome... Cold Cokes right here. -There is child labor. -[Pelle laughs] So are you gonna buy a soda? -No. -You sure? You know you want one! You're thirsty! [Vee] Like the peacock, the male Texan adorns himself to attract the opposite sex... By painting his body and making very guttural sounds in a show of alpha male dominance. What the fuck did you just say? Was that funny, hippie? Was that funny? -[Pelle protests] -Hey-- [shrieks and shouts] Boo-ya! God. Don't! Stop! [music plays] [Pelle] There must have been beer in that pool. [sputters] Or piss. Hey! Can't a man get some privacy here? Fuck! Give me that. -Give me that! -No! -Hey! Hey! -Hey! Hey, you! [both laughing] -What you got right here? -Oh, my God! [squeals] Excuse me, miss. Hi, I'm from a civilized country. I've come to patronize you for the viewers back home. No, no, no, no, no-- agh! No, no, no, no, no! Yes! -[music ends] -[both laughing] -Mmm. -Oh, my God. [both laugh] Well... you can go. But... I wish this could stay. [sighs contentedly] -Can I keep it? -[laughs] Yes, I wish I didn't have to go home tomorrow. Dude, that was a compliment, not an upgrade to boyfriend class. Oh... No, I just meant... I really don't want to go home. I feel like a dork. My best friend, Soren, he got me this job back home. Mm-hmm. And I decided to cut my trip short. Well, that's really grown-up of you. Yeah... I'm a wanker. Yeah. You know, Max and Kristian, they would have given me shit forever. Otherwise... -I wouldn't have met you. -Oh, come on! They're your friends and you're supposed to tell them about your stupid jobs. And they're supposed to give you shit about it. Well, the thing is... They really don't like Soren. Mm. He's kind of unpredictable, and they think he's crazy. [Vee laughs] We've been friends since forever. Even my parents aren't so sure about him. Yeah? I could tell you some stuff that would freak you out, but... [whispers] Tell me. Well... This one's good, actually. Um, a bunch of us broke into a public pool and went -Skinny-dipping. -Mm-hmm. And we got caught. And everybody's trying to get dressed except Soren. He just walks up to these security guys stark naked and he starts to chat. And he's smiling and talking about crime... [Vee chuckles] And all the while, he's getting this serious fucking hard-on. Gross! Yes, the security guys didn't like it either and they threw us in detention. Nothing serious, just to scare us because we were kids. He's great. I think you'd like him. So, he's like... The bart to your Milhouse-- always getting you in trouble. Yeah... That's funny. Every time somebody asks him directions in English, no matter where they're going, he'll direct them to the viking ship museum. [laughs] Can you... Teach me how to ask directions to the viking ship museum? Of course I can. -You ready? -Okay. Undskyld, kan de vise mig vejen til viking museet? Okay... Undskyld... [gibberish] Something... Skoot. [mumbling in Danish] Yes, yes. Come to Denmark, you'll get the hang of it. That's a long way to go to learn a language that nobody speaks. Yeah, it's completely useless. It'd be just for fun. Yeah. Just like us, Milhouse. Just for fun. Right. [birds chirping] [alarm beeps, radio playing soft music] [sighs contentedly] [song on radio continues] Hey, hold still! What are you doing? In case you need my number. Only for an emergency. That's not a number. [laughs] [laughs] [chuckles] -Gimme, gimme, gimme! -No! -Gimme! -No! Okay, anything but your number. All right. All right. What are you gonna write? Oh, nothing. Nothing special. Just, you know... The names of our children. What? [Pelle laughs] Ugh! [door slams, ♪] [car engine idling] [trunk slams] [music plays] Oh, Milhouse, what was that? Oh, I'm saving it... For when you come to Denmark. [music plays] Get out of here. [music plays] Ooh, lady, you better just start talking right now 'cause you owe me so many details. I'm not telling you shit. Oh, is that what you think? [laughs] I'm not! [laughs] Oh! Well, I have ways of getting information when I want it! So is this normal for girls to drive cabs in Texas? I'm a musician. Have you ever heard of a band called cock holster? [laughs] Come on, gimme the cheese, babe, come on! Nothing... You're not gonna tell me anything? Wow... Wow! It mustbe love! [music plays] Hey, you're back. How are you feeling? You look great. I feel great, thanks. You know, sick is sick, but you know, I'm here every day and it's just like... You know. I know. I'm sorry. It's all right, go! Go do your thing, thanks. [music plays] Hey. Can you turn around? Did you forget something? Yeah, I'll bet you did. [music plays] [phone vibrating] [children whining] Give me that! Hey, Tess, will you cover for me? Yes, but you owe me. Thanks. Hey! Hey! Hello? [Man] Hello, am I speaking with Lisa? Milhouse? [shaker clatters] Cool, cool, cool, cool. Is Tess your real name or just your waitress name? Uh, I don't know. What's a waitress name? I knew you weren't a real waitress. [music plays] [no dialogue] [music plays] [Boy] Hey. [Vee sniffles] [Man] So you were the one that wrote that on his arm? [Vee] Yeah. [sniffling] Could I see his face? No, I don't think you want that, ma'am. When the cab was hit, your friend was... thrown from the vehicle. Uh... Unfortunately, he landed in the road and was hit by another car. -[crying] -I don't think he suffered. It was pretty terrible, but... at least he didn't suffer. Did he go by any other names? That you know of? Besides "Milhouse"? I couldn't pronounce his real name. So that's what I called him instead. And do you normally go by "Lisa"? John, they're nicknames. But you two were dating? No. But he had your number. We just... We just met. Okay, so you don't know if he has any family here, and you don't know how to get in touch with any of his friends, and you were never gonna see him again. Look, do you have any idea why he might have turned his cab around... And headed away from the airport at the time of the accident? Huh? Veronica, we just need any information you got, okay? Okay. His stuff didn't come out of the accident in too good a condition. If you have any information that would be helpful about why he may have planned to stay in the country... Maybe he forgot something. -Okay, maybe he left something at your place? -No. John... We'll call the consulate. It's what we were gonna do anyway. It's not a problem, okay? -Okay. -Don't worry about it. Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm really sorry. It's not your fault. Look, I'm really sorry about him in there, you know? He's just... It's paperwork. Officer Hayslip. [hyperventilating] Oh, my God. You okay? Come here. It's okay. I didn't really know him. It doesn't matter. It's okay. It's okay. You want a cigarette? -No. -Okay. I can get you some coffee if you need it. Whatever you need, okay? Shoot, I mean, if one of my friends died like that... I don't know what I'd do. [tearfully] We weren't really friends. Or lovers. You okay? Yeah. [quietly] You want a joint? What? I mean, I know I'm a cop, but sometimes... That's okay. Thank you. It's okay, you're welcome. I'm gonna go. You okay to drive? I'm gonna go. -You sure you're all right? -Yeah, thank you. What a fucking douche. If he wasn't a cop, I'd totally kick his ass for you. I can't report him. Probably could have used a joint. That's not the fucking point. I'm not gonna get him fired. I already have a death on my conscience. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up, what are you talking about? It's because of me he's dead. If he hadn't slept here, or-- What is this? Have you been talking to your mother or something? Baby, this is not your fault. He died because of a traffic accident, not because he had sex with you. Vee... Repeat after me. "My pussy does not kill." Come on, "my pussy does not kill." My pussy does not kill. [laughs] [sighs] [call ringing through] [beep] -[Pelle speaking Danish] -[beep] Hello? Hello? Hello? [phone beeps off] [Tess] How much do they cost? Why do you have to ask like that, Tess? Well, are you gonna have anything left over for rent? Well... I wanted to talk to you about that. Oh, this is fucked! You can't do this! Tess... I am not asking for your permission. What is that supposed to mean? I already bought the tickets, and it leaves this afternoon. Veronica, I think you're making a crazy, stupid mistake. Fuck you! You practically threw him at me! Tess! I'm not going, okay? I'm not gonna go! You should fucking go. -You don't need mypermission. -I'll stay. I will stay! I'm not gonna be treated like an asshole for worrying about you! -I'm gonna stay, Tess! -[car starts] You're acting stupid. Okay! I'm gonna stay! [tires squealing] I'm staying, you fucking cunt! [music plays] [music plays] [music plays] -Do you speak English? -Yes, I do. Um... Do you how to get to... Gronna-gade? Grenna-giddeh? Gronna-gade? Do we have the exactly address? Yeah, Gronnegade. Fine. Gronnegade. [music plays] [music plays] [music plays] [tries to open door] [music plays] Hello, Milhouse's cat. [cat meows] Meow. [cat meows] Meow.

I'm just one of his friends, giving the cat some cat food, but I, I just leave. -I'm so sorry. -No, wait. Um-- Could I have my arm back, please? -Pelle's not here. He's dead. -Oh, I'm sorry about that. I mean, he was a great guy, and I'm really sorry, but-- You think I'm joking? It's really fun, you're a really great actress, but can I-- -But he's not here. -Well, fine. Where are you two-- Pelle? -It's not funny. -Pelle, are you in there? -[chuckling] -Don't go. -Pelle! -He's not here. Can I have my arm back, please? -Please. -No, no, no. You know, I'm sorry that I-- that I said that all American girls are fat, I'm sorry, but could you tell me where he is because I haven't got all day and it's really not that funny-- Pelle! -[Vee turns shower off] -Pelle? Don't worry, I will find him. [music plays] Where could you be? Pelle? I-- I got him! Come out, Pelle, come. [whistles] Come here. Pelle?

I'm really sorry. I don't know what to do. I really have no idea what to do. Huh? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Soren! [music plays] [shouting] Soren!

You better leave him alone! I was really mad at you because I said stay and you left. -What do we do? I-- -I got fireworks. You pick one of them because you was in love with him. [whispers] You pick one of them. [both panting] [Vee] What are you doing? [shrieks] [fuse hisses] [popping] [music plays] This one's for you. Okay, this one is for Pelle. And this one is for me. [crackling, popping] And... For the cat. [crackling, popping] [music plays] [music plays] It's okay, I could have the day off. I don't think I ever seen anyone so hungry before. There was only cat food in Milhouse's apartment. You know, I know there was some leverpostej. -Um, the can in the fridge? -Yeah. That was cat food. [chuckling] No, no, no. It's, um... Leverpostej, it's very Danish, traditional-- Cat food. No, it's not cat food. You should try to taste it. -It's really good, actually. -I tried it. Cat food. No, it says "leverpostej" and it-- Cat food. [Soren chuckles] [radio plays in the background] Did you call Pelle "Milhouse?" Yeah. That's what we called each other. He called me "Lisa." It was this really stupid thing that we did. I can call you "Lisa." Lisa. You two would have had beautiful children, you know that? Very, very beautiful children. -No. -I don't mean right now, but if you wanted to have children, it would have been beautiful. No, uh, it wasn't like that. Don't misunderstand me. I mean, later, if you wanted to have some kids, I just think it would be-- -No, like seriously... -Mm? All we did was have a lot of sex. Yeah? You made love? No, it wasn't love. It was sex. But can I not say that you're beautiful and Pelle's beautiful? And I just think that you would have had beautiful... Children. No... So he came to your restaurant and then he started to flirt with you? Maybe he did, maybe it was the other way around. Yeah, that's just like him, you know. He always makes you wonder if something is his idea or your idea or... Shit. You know, this is my fault. It's my fault that he's dead. No... It doesn't work like that. The cops told me that his cab was headed away from the airport. He was coming back to you. He was in love with you. Well, if he hadn't loved me, you'd still be talking to him right now. [Woman speaking Danish] I'm sorry... [both sobbing] Maybe we should talk in English. Um... I'm really sorry about your son. I don't know, I, um... I just... He was a really great guy. Maybe you can both come for dinner tonight. Yeah. Yeah. [Soren] Yeah, we used to come here a lot, me and Pelle and our friends. Just... Picnic on the beach and bathing naked, that kind of thing. Do you mean skinny-dipping? -What? -Skinny-dipping? -Eh... -Skinny-dipping. It was always his idea. But he'd make you think it was yours. God, that show-off. Well, actually once... We all... We broke in this big house in Risskov... You know, we found a lot of alcohol-- vodka, gin, that kind of stuff-- and we got all really drunk and then we saw they had this big swimming pool, so we took off our clothes and went this... Skin... Dipping... Skinny-dipping? Skinny-dipping. Yeah, and then we had a lot of fun but then the police came and we were just... [screams] Getting up and just clothes on, but you know Pelle, he just walks straight to them, all naked, and then he starts to tell about his TV show to this police officer who knows him from the television and then he asks Pelle for his autograph for his kids, so... That's, that's how it's like to hang out with famous people. You liar! What? He told me that story. It was you, not him. And you got everybody arrested. Yeah. You know, I just thought it would be a better story if it was about him. [chuckles] So what were you talking about with his family? I did tell them that you were more than a girlfriend. Okay... Yeah, that you and Pelle were gonna get married. That's good. [scoffs] What did you really tell them? That you were going to marry. -Fuck! -I mean, I had no choice. You have to understand. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off, fuck off! They wanted you to leave, okay? So I had to tell them something so you could stay. What the fuck am I supposed to now, huh? Hey, hey, they don't know what you two had, okay? What the fuck do you know what we had? -How do you know? -Hey, you don't have to-- [both scream] What did you do? Fuck! Asshole! -Hey, I'm really sorry. -Fucking asshole. You know what, get out of the fucking water, you crazy shithead. Hey, I'm really... Are you okay? [shivering] Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill you. Hey, let me warm you! I'm cold! Lisa... [knocking on door] Lisa, do you think I could get a... [knocks] [music plays] [utensils clatter in kitchen] I love salad. [indistinct] ...But I think it's good. [general conversation] [Mom] So then you traveled with him and his friends? No. [Dad] Instead he stayed with you for a while? -Yeah. -Yeah... [speaking Danish] Still, it must have been a surprise after such a short time. I mean, did he propose, or was it your idea to get married? He got on one knee and popped the bling-bling. [Soren] Yeah. Um, well, he... He definitely surprised me. Mm-hmm. He wrote me this note... Mm, he did. [chuckles] A really funny note. -It was so funny... -Yeah. Really funny. Really funny. It was much better than a ring. We had this, um, this really huge fight... Because he never, I mean, he -never talked about us to you guys... -No. -And then he kind of sprung this whole... Marriage... -Yeah, I mean, that is, that -is so much like Pelle... Full of surprises and... -Yeah. You remember when he gave you all of these kittens as a gift without telling you? Yeah. Oh, sorry, we all must speak English when veronica is here. Oh, yeah, sorry. We were happy that he went traveling and also with his TV job, it's... But we were missing him so much. He wasn't here and... So everything has been a surprise for too long. He would get used to being away and we didn't hear from him that much. No, except when there were trouble or when he needed money. It's not that I want him... Wanted him to call me all the time, it's just... Yeah, but you know, we all grow up, don't we? Yeah, you do. It would have... It would have been good to know what he thought of Texas and that he had met someone like you. [Soren] Cheers. [All] Cheers. [glasses clink] [water running] I'll start drying those off. Need some help? No, I... I can help. -No, I don't think you should help. -[speaking Danish to mom] We got it, yeah? We got it under control, right? [Boy] Yeah, we got it under control. [speaking Danish] [Vee] He has long hair here. [Mom] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, he liked that a lot. It's actually not that long ago. He wore like, what do you call it, a horse tail? [chuckles] A ponytail. A ponytail, yeah. This one, what's he doing here? Oh, he was on TV and they threw a cake at him as a joke on his last day. You must have been really proud of Milhouse. Yeah. [indistinct voices inside house] [Soren shivers] Where you going? Oh, I thought you were going to stay. I think I have to. Yeah, I might go see some of Pelle's friends. They're having a party. Yeah, I think you're welcome. But... It's okay. You say that like it's not okay. And why are you just rushing off like that anyway? Well, I'm not family... Like you. I can't believe that we're doing this. But... I mean, can't you see you make them very happy in there? And that's important. If I could do the same, I mean... I just think that it is... It is very important for them to know that you and Pelle were very, very much in love. -Stop saying that. -Okay, but then why did you come here? I don't know. I don't know. So you want to come with me? Really, I don't know why you came. I just know that Pelle, he was in love with you, and that's important to me. I didn't lie for you, I lied for him. Yes, I did. [mom and dad speaking Danish] Is there something wrong? No... He just had to meet some friends. You have to be careful with him, Veronica. Always in this door, out that door with him. We've known him since he was a kid. He's wonderful, he has a good heart... but sometimes his heart gets crazy too. Hey, Lisa, I've got Pelle's show for you. [tape whirs] [whispers] No... [music from TV] Sorry... I'm really sorry. [woman speaking Danish on TV] I understand. I can't watch him either... Not now. Right now I wish I'd never let him do it. He was our little child and he should be at home with us. But he got to help people. Yeah... He did. He did. Yeah. [muffled music and party sounds] [birds chirping, distant hammering] [paper crinkling] [cat meows] [speaking Danish] Hey, Jones... You think you could help me with something? Total secret mission. [man singing in Danish] I've got your back. Come on, go. All right, give me five. [singing continues] [chuckles] Don't tell me you smoke. I'm gonna tell your parents. I'm not old enough. So how do you know how to roll? Pelle taught me. He said it would impress girls. He said girls like when boys can do careful things with their fingers. Oh, my God! Really? Wow... That must be the best advice a guy ever gave his kid brother. Here... What's this for? Well, you're not supposed to write on anything with it... Not mailboxes or light posts or anything. [record playing Danish song] You know, Jones was born right after Pelle left for the TV show. It became easier that he wasn't there because we had a baby in the house. But I think it shouldn't have been easier. Well, I guess it's difficult to explain and understand, but... But you'll have children. They surprises you. I've been missing this record for years and I wouldn't have thought that Pelle would have it. We used to listen to it in the car when we was driving from Copenhagen to here, and I would sing along, you know, just a bit... Yeah... It's nice. I like it. You can have it if you want. No... No, you keep giving me all of his things. They're yours, they're yours. I mean... I, I wasn't really with him for a very long time. I don't... I understand. [record continues playing] [Dad] Well, we should go back now. [Vee] I think I just want tobe here until the funeral. Okay. [Jonas] Can I stay with you? [Mom] Okay, bye, then. -You take care. -Okay. Bye. [knocking on door] Hey. Hey. Can I come in? Please? You know, I... I don't really want to be alone tonight. Where are you going? I'm really tired. I need to go to bed. -Good night. -Good night. Do you mind if I... I sleep on the sofa? I never thought I would be in a bed with my best friend's girlfriend. I'm not his girl. [clears throat] I'm just the one that they could call. Yeah, but you know what I mean. [clears throat] Soren? Soren, are you awake? [whispers] Thank you. Thank you. [kissing] Oh, God, Lisa. No. Don't call me that. Don't call me that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What's wrong? What's wrong? [bell tolling] [tolling continues] Where is Soren? I don't know. [tolling continues] [tolling stops] [organ begins playing inside] Mother wants you to come in now. [solemn organ music playing] [woman speaking in Danish] [woman continues speaking] [woman stops speaking, choir begins singing] [choir continues singing] [mother speaking Danish] Thank you for coming. Thank you. [choir continues] Hey. Hey. You okay? No. No, I'm sorry, I can't... Who are you?! [overlapping voices] You come with me. [overlapping voices] [men shouting in Danish] [Vee] Stop it! [Mom] Why are you doing this to us?! [Vee] I'm pregnant. [Soren shouts in Danish] So you thought there would be a baby? Do you want that? "Want"? [sobs] I don't want anything! [sobbing] I want my Pelle! On the way to the airport... He turned the taxi around and he was headed towards me. And that's when the accident happened. He wasn't supposed to be in love with me. You should hate me. Why should I believe this isn't another story? When he was with you... Was he happy? [Father] There's a flight in two hours. It does not go to Texas, but it will get you home. Thank you. We'll send your things. -I have to go get my stuff... -There's no time. [music plays] [music plays] Hey, driver? Yes? Never mind. [music plays] [tires skid, thud] [driver protests in Danish] [Vee] No, it's okay, he's with me. I should kick you both out. [music plays] [panting] Don't leave, please... Not yet. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant? Because I'm not. Now we could make it true. And maybe we already did. Then we could have... Then we could have Pelle's baby. You're retarded. Can you tell him to turn around? [music plays] I have to go home. Hey, can I have a pen, please? Thanks. Stay, please. So... do you want me to turn around? [music plays] No. Here. Okay. [Pelle's voice] [music plays] [music plays] [music plays] [Football fan on tape] Was that funny, hippie, huh? How funny was that? [shouts, overlapping voices] [Pelle on tape] Hey, can't a man get some privacy in here? Gimme that! Gimme that!
