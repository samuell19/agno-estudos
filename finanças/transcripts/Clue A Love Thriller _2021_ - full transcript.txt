-Sir, I lost my car. -This isn't the time. Go away. We can't search for it in the night. Come back tomorrow. Sir, I bought it with my hard-earned money. I paid the last EMI yesterday. -Please help me find my car -Hey! Don't you get it? I'll shoot you if you drive me mad. Go away! Namaste, sir. What is this? -What are you doing, constable? -His car is missing. It's late in the night and you're not here, so... What you're doing is very wrong. We're the police. Police are public property. We're here for public security. We're getting paid with the taxes that the public pay. We're living off of their hard work. As long as we live, we should work for their welfare. We should protect them and give them courage. -Never do this again. -Okay, sir. -Where did you lose your car? -At the market center, sir Check all the CCTV footage from the market. Okay, sir. -When did you lose the car? -30 minutes ago, sir. Which means, they couldn't have gotten far. Inform all the nearby police stations. We'll find your car within an hour. Give a written complaint and mention your address and phone number. Okay, sir. -We'll inform you as soon as find the car. -Thank you, sir. Give a written complaint. Sir, it's my wife. She's really innocent. They beat me unconscious and kidnapped her. Sir, it happened here. They beat me and took my wife. -Which way did the car go? -This way, sir. Who is that? Who the hell is that? Sir! Let's go. I have some urgent work. I'll send the constable. Okay, sir. I'm a loser who couldn't protect my wife, sir. Damn it! Please. I can understand your pain. Be strong. -What's your wife's name? -Pavitra, sir. Pavitra... -Do you have a photograph? -Yes, sir. Here you go, sir. Sir, there's a missing case issue. Is it the same case about 3 missing guys from 10 days back? Yes, sir. We couldn't find any clue whatsoever. We can't determine if it's a missing case, murder case or a kidnap scene. Give me your file. These 3 guys have been missing for 10 days, sir. Sir! It's them! These rogues kidnapped my wife. What?! -They kidnapped your wife?! -Yes, sir. They're the kidnappers. There's a missing persons case filed on them 10 days back. If they've been missing for 10 days, how did they kidnap your wife. I'm telling the truth, sir. They kidnapped her right in front of my eyes. Is there any bad blood between you guys? Yes, sir. It's not just a petty fight. There's a whole story to it. [religious chants] Rohit... Rohit... Rohit... You'll be late for work. Get up! Just once, please. You've kept me up till 2 in the morning. Wasn't that enough? You'll be late for work. -I'll be late. I have to go. -No. No. Last bite. Just one last bite. No. I'm getting late. -Bye. -Bye. 'Love you, sweetheart!' 'Love you too.'

What did you make for dinner? Nothing yet. Tell me what you like. I'll make it. First, let me go get tea. Pavitra... Stop. Why do you look dull? What happened? I'm fine. Don't I know my wife's mood after all these years of marriage? It's okay. Tell me what happened. It's nothing, really. Swear on me. What happened? The 3 guys in the opposite flat... Yeah, what about them? They've been teasing me for quite some time now. They've been ringing the bell using some excuse and talking vulgar to me. They've even asked me to come to their flat. I got really scared. I said I'll go to the cops if they mess with me again. As soon as you leave to work tomorrow morning, if I don't go to them, they threatened to kill you. Who are you looking for? I want to talk to them. Come in. -He wants to talk to you. -Who is it? -Hi, uncle. -Oh, hello there, uncle. We asked aunty to come. Why are you here? Maybe he escorted aunty here. -Uncle, you're amazing. -Where's aunty? Listen, Pavan. We belong to a decent family. Do you think we're cheapskates? Are you calling us indecent? No, Pavan. We're a respected family. My wife is really innocent. Please leave her alone. How did you think we can do that? Those cheeks and those arms... How can we not get a taste of it at least once? I so want to grab her waist and kiss her on the cheek roughly. We need her only for a week. We won't bother you after that. How dare you talk about my wife like that! Did you just raise your voice? Give me the knife! You'll be dead if I cut here. If you die, your wife will go looking for many men like us. Pavan, I'm begging you. Please leave us alone. Go bring your wife. We'll send her back after a week. I'll go to the police. -Police, huh? -Hey! Take your shirt off. -Take your shirt off, you loser! -Take it off! Come on! -Take it off, you bloody! -Come on, do it! Take it off, you loser! -Pull your pants down. -Come on! Unzip your pants, you bastard! Come on! -He's acting so fancy! -Make it fast. -What the hell, man! -Please let me go. If you don't bring your wife to us tomorrow night, we will make you walk naked on the street. -Go away! -Get out of here! Get out! He got scared! I knew they were bad people. That is why I didn't tell you. Sit down. You're hurt pretty badly. Let's go to the hospital. No. They're small wounds. What do we do about this? Let's file a police case. Do you really think they'd be scared of the police? Is it? Let's vacate the house and move. Hey! You should bring your wife to us tonight. Hey! You should bring your wife to us tonight. You should bring your wife to us tonight. Bring her tonight. Bring your wife to us tonight. This is our new house. We don't have to go back there anymore. -What about all our stuff? -It's on the way. I've hired movers. That was a narrow escape. Thinking of them is still giving me the chills. We've moved away from that area. They can't get to us now. There's no way they will know our whereabouts. Hey! Step out! You think you can leave us and go? -Rohit! -Where do you think you're going? You think you can get away from us? -Pavitra! Guys, let me go! -Rohit! -Pavitra... -Let me go! What are you guys up to? Don't hit him! -Take her away, guys! -Come on, move it. -Get into the car. -Let me go! Pavitra... Start the car. -Pavitra... Pavitra... -Rohit! Rohit! Pavitra... Pavitra... They hit me and took Pavitra away, sir. They took her right in front of my eyes. Sir, you have to find my wife. Please! Listen... Constables are already searching for your wife. We'll inform you once we find her. -You go try from your end. -Okay, sir. I'll also go and look for Pavitra. Good morning, sir. Pavan and gang have been missing for 10 days. Now they've kidnapped Rohit's wife. They know they'd be charged for kidnapping Pavitra's wife. Maybe they filed a missing persons case in advance? Going by this logic, they're going to kill Pavitra. -This is a rather mysterious case. -Yes, sir. We can solve the case if we find Pavan's driver. We caught him in a pickpocketing case before. -I have his address. -Let's go. Who the hell are you? You bastard! Die! Die! You douche bag! Let's go! We should take this right turn, sir. That's where the driver lives. Okay, let's go. Shit! Enquire who killed him. Okay, sir. -Stay here and complete the formalities. -Okay, sir. Greetings, sir. -Where's Pavan's flat? -Come, let me show you, sir. This is Pavan's flat, sir. Pavan. Rohit. When was the last time you saw Pavan? It's been 10-12 days, sir. -What about Rohit? -They used to live in this flat. Have you noticed Pavan and gang tease, torture or harass Rohit's wife? Pavan and gang harassing Pavitra? Pavitra was the one who harassed them, sir. Pavitra harassed them?! Yes, sir. She's a dangerous lady. [religious chants] Rohit... Rohit... Just once, please. You've kept me up till 2 in the morning. Wasn't that enough? I'll see you. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. 'Hi, sweetheart. It's been an hour since I left you.' What's with him and his cringe-y texts? 'An hour feels like a lifetime!' Bloody immature! He'll get upset if I don't reply. 'It feels like a lifetime to you.' 'But it feels like the end of the world to me.' What a sexy-looking aunty! Don't stare, guys. It's not decent. We have exams coming up, boys. This is such bad timing. Holy smokes! She is out of the world! What a hottie! They're so in trouble! You're late, sweetheart! Do we have to do it every day? Can't we take a day off? I'll surely leave you alone tomorrow. You're so stubborn! You never listen to me. Guys, this is irresistible! Why am I getting disturbed over this? Damn it! We're thirsty. Get inside. Now tell me. What do you guys want? -We ran out of water. -Phone battery is dead. Body is heated up. I know what you guys are here for. Wait.

Get up! -Come on! -I can't do it. -Vasu... -Yeah? -Come on! -I'm done! Pavan... Get up! Come on! Get up! -Come on! -I can't do it, aunty. Spare me. What are these guys up to? Let me call them. Oh, god! The blood sucker is calling again! She'll suck our blood if she gets hold of us. Cut the call. How dare he cut my call! Let me call Prashanth. Crap! She's calling me. Turn off your phones, guys. He also cut my call. Okay, let me call Vasu. 'The number you've called is switched off. Please try later.' What happened? We shouldn't have gotten involved with her. I don't think she'll leave us alone. If we stay away for a week or so, she'll get fed up and stop bothering us. What the hell! You don't come home when I call. You don't answer my calls. In fact, you turn your phones off, huh? Forget whatever happened and leave us alone. We have exams coming up. Don't disturb us. If we don't study now, our future will be spoiled. I'll skin you alive if you start acting up. First get inside the room. We're not coming. You don't know what I'm capable of. You better obey me and come inside right now. We're not coming. Do whatever you want. Whatever I want? Oh, yeah? Did you seriously underestimate Pavitra? Want to know what I'll do? Take a look. What the hell! Should I upload these videos on YouTube? If these go viral, who would marry you? Would you still have a future? If I get pissed and file a case on you... Should I claim that you manipulated me and raped me? Come on! Answer me! Should I upload the video? Should I file a case? From now on, you should come whenever I call you. You should do whatever I tell you. Come on! No! Stop! -Leave me. I have to study for exams. -Come on. Please let me go. Please. Pavitra has been harassing them from that day. She even got them to make her husband strip. One midnight, Pavitra and Rohit vacated the house and moved. Pavan and gang also went missing after 2 days. Sir. Did you get caught in a brothel ride again? Sir, I have no other means of living. It's brokers like you who ruin the lives of innocent women like her. Take him to court tomorrow. According to Rohit's story, Pavan and gang seem like psychos. According to the watchman, Rohit is super innocent. Pavitra is a dangerous lady. There's one common point in both the statements, sir. Rohit was made to strip and then got beaten up. Rohit vacated the house at midnight. The 3 guys went missing 2 days after they moved. Pavitra is in the center of everything. If we find Pavitra, all the knots will come untied. -Do you have Pavitra's photograph? -Yes, sir. Here you go. Ouch! This isn't Pavitra, sir. -Her name is Shanti. -What?! Shanti?! -Do you know her? -Of course, I do, sir. She's a prostitute. -Do you know her? -Not just know her. She's a full-on prostitute. She pretends to be somebody's wife each time, acts like a family woman and sleeps around for money. What?! Why did these guys kidnap a prostitute? Who would kidnap her, sir? She's capable of kidnapping 100 people. We must catch her. Only then can we solve the problem. There's a girls broker named Sagar. They work together. If you catch him, he'll give you all the details. Do you know where he lives? He lives in the guest house outside the city. I beg you. Tell him not to kill me. What are you looking at, Rohit? Kill this bloody bugger! I'm ready. -What are you doing here? -I'm returning from my hometown, sir. -Where do you live? -At the end of that lane, sir. I'm actually scared. I was hoping that someone would help me out. Is it? Let me drop you home. -Where's your house? -It's nearby. Take the adjacent lane. -Come, let me drop you. -Okay, sir. It's you?! Let go! Rohit! Hey! Hey! I'm not a good cop like you guys assumed. Pickpocketers, hooligans, drug dealers... They're all part of my gang. I run illegal businesses through them. You people killed all my men. Now you're trying to kill me. Talk to me! You're a prostitute. Rohit filed a case saying that you/his wife got kidnapped. You both planned to kill me. Why? What's the reason? You made those three guys strip Rohit and beat him. You both planned to kill me. Why? What's the reason? Why? Seriously? Do you even know who Rohit is? Brother... -Brother, stop! -No! Brother... -I said stop! -Please listen to me, dear. -Please. Please. -Brother... If you don't do what I say... I'll get upset. -And if I get upset... -You'll stop eating. And if you don't eat your food, I'll be hurt. If I should eat and you also shouldn't get hurt, I should listen to you. Do I have a choice? That's better. This is such a girl's thing, dear. Mehendi isn't just for girls. To be honest, while mehendi adds beauty to a girl, it gives happiness to a boy. Where is my sister learning all this from? My love for you is making me say all this. Vennela... That's too much mischief. No, that's too much love for her brother. You won't eat if I don't apply mehendi. But I can't eat with the mehendi on my hands. That is why... Your sister really loves you. What is it, brother? Your eyes are teary. You love me so much. When you get married, who will shower me with love? I won't leave you so soon. I won't get married until you get married. And I'll get married only after you do. I'll get married only after you do. Stop arguing. It's so silly. You tell me, mom. Who should get married first? Me or brother? We'll get you married at the same time. -Look at him, mom. -Don't take him seriously. Let's go have lunch. -Does she have fever, doctor? -Yeah, I'm seeing symptoms of malaria. 10 days of medication and she should be fine. Okay. Give her this medication. I'll take care of it. Here you go, love. Take the tablet. Have some water. Brother... Brother... Brother... -Mom, where's brother? -What? I can't find him anywhere. Dad isn't around either. Where did these two go? Come, let me take you to them. -Where, mom? -Come, you'll understand. Where is he, mom? There he is. Brother! Brother! Calm down, dear.

Thanks, brother. May you live long! May you be happy for a 100 years. When I have a brother like you, I'll be happy for not 100 but 1000 years. [parents] God bless you, dear! Hi, dad! Bye. -Hi, baby. -Hi. -Why do you sound dull? -There's a small problem. -Problem? What problem? -It's nothing. I'll be fine. -You want to come? -No, it's okay. Baby, we've been in love for 3 years now. I've never seen you sound so low. I'm going to be your wife soon. I have the responsibility to solve your problems. -I'm coming. -Okay. Hi... Why do you sound so dull? What's the problem? Come inside. You'll understand. What's wrong? Oh, my god! Look at that! -How is it? -It's so beautiful! Oh, god! Amazing! Beautiful! Come in. -Look around. -This is amazing! -Happy birthday, baby! -Thank you! -Happy birthday, Vennela! -Thank you. Thank you. This is the best surprise of my life. Thank you. Come, cut the cake. Cut the cake. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday to you, Vennela! -Thank you. Happy birthday! Here you go, priest. It's my sister Vennela's birthday today. Please say all the chants you know and pray for her well-being. Sure, Rohit. I know you love your sister dearly. [religious chants] -Okay, Pavan. We'll get going. -Yeah, man. You guys have fun. -Happy birthday once again, Vennela. -Enjoy! -Bye, guys. -Thank you. Bye, guys. What will the birthday baby gift her lover? The birthday baby has to gift you something? Alright. I'll only give the birthday baby a gift. Not right now. Only after marriage. You want to get married in front of a crowd, get escorted to our bedroom by a group of ladies on the nuptial night, have our first night mechanically while they sit by the door and discuss us? -Is that what you're saying? -I can't hear anything you just said. I can't do this. No way! I've prayed for Vennela. Please bow to the holy fire. -Brother... -Hi, sweetheart! -I have good news for you. -Are you getting married? No, you are. -Brother, stop joking. -I'm serious, sweetheart. They have 100 acres of land, rice mills and ice factories in assets. The guy lives in America. -Brother... -Yes, dear? Well, the thing is... -What's his name? -How did you know? If a girl is blushing at the mention of marriage, she is definitely in love. So, who's the lucky guy? His name is Pavan. He lives here. You'll definitely like him. If you like him, I'll like him too. I'm sure you'll like him, brother. But he's not that well-off. You inherit 50% of our wealth. What about mom and dad? I'll convince them, come talk to his parents and get you married to him. -Okay, sweetheart? -I love you, brother. "We're eternal lovers Our love is a blessing" 'We're eternal lovers We speak the symphony of love" "Our cute little love story blooms like the spring" "Our love stands the test of time and becomes glorious" "We're eternal lovers Our love is a blessing" 'We're eternal lovers We speak the symphony of love" "Our cute little love story blooms like the spring" "Our love stands the test of time and becomes glorious" 'Our love is an endless treasure that makes my heart glow" 'It's a tale that goes down in history as the epitome of love" "Our love is a dedication to the gentle connection between us" "Your heart is the sweetest This feels like a penance of love" "Time melts the distance keeping us apart" "It's a dream the eyes haven't seen before" "I have manifested it right here" "We're eternal lovers Our love is a blessing" 'We're eternal lovers We speak the symphony of love" "Our cute little love story blooms like the spring" "Our love stands the test of time and becomes glorious" "My unspoken desires ask for your attention" "These moments of romance promise me a lifetime of happiness" "Heart cannot keep calm when you're around" "I found you through a magical play of destiny" "Your touch takes me to a place of bliss" "The urge to embrace you is intense" "I know this feeling like I know my breath" "We're eternal lovers Our love is a blessing" 'We're eternal lovers We speak the symphony of love" "Our cute little love story blooms like the spring" "Our love stands the test of time and becomes glorious" "We're eternal lovers Our love is a blessing" 'We're eternal lovers We speak the symphony of love" She doesn't have a great body. I can't pay more than 10 lakhs. Get lost! Rambabu offered 30 lakhs. Hold on. You know how hard it is to trap a girl and make her believe you're in love with her? We've trapped 10 girls till now and sold them to you. You're selling them in Dubai for millions of cash. Alright. Let's not fight among ourselves. 30 lakhs is too much. Give me another number. 25 lakhs. Period. Okay, done. When will you hand over the product? You know our formalities. You'll have it in 2 days. Keep the cash ready. Okay, done. Reject such a well-off family and get her married to some guy she loves? Dad, times have changed. We've seen so many couples. They get into an arranged marriage and then get a divorce within a month. Because newly-weds don't know anything about each other. They don't know what the other person likes. They don't know each other's hearts. They fail to understand each other or compromise once they get married. They get a divorce. Vennela and Pavan have been in love for 3 years now. They've gotten to know each other. They'll be happy together, dad. No matter what you say... -Getting her married to a stranger is... -It will be okay, dad. Trust me this once. Do as you wish. Hi! Oh, hi! I have good news and a surprise for you. I'm so excited and you don't even ask what it is? Okay. Tell me about it. We are getting married! I told my brother and he accepted us. In fact, he also convinced my parents. He said he'll talk to your parents at a good time. Baby, you don't have to look for a good time. Your good time has arrived long back. Take a look at this. What is this? Pavan! Pavan, what is this? Are you still oblivious? We trapped you. You cheated me?! If I upload this video on YouTube, I'll get a million views. Imagine the wrath of you and your brother. From now on, you should do whatever we tell you. You should come wherever we call you. If you refuse, we'll make this video go viral. I trusted you. But I was wrong. If my brother finds out about this, he'll chop you into pieces. I'll tell him right away! Where do you think you're going? Pavan, leave me! I'll kill you guys! Brother, please come and save me. Leave me! Brother... Please leave me. Leave me, guys! Brother... Hey! Leave me! Pass the phone. Call you goddamn brother! Tell him to transfer cash. -Hi, sweetheart! -Brother, I need some money. Brother, listen... I need money, brother. -Okay, I'll bring the money to you. -We don't have time. -Transfer the money. -Okay, I'll do it right away. I've transfered the money, dear. -Why do you sound low, dear? -It's nothing. Where are you right now? 'The number you've called is switched off. Please try later.' 'The number you've called is switched off. Please try later.' -Mom, I'm going to see Vennela. -What's so urgent? I'll explain later. We can't do this business without the support of seniors like you. -She's really fresh. -It's a small gift from us. Planning to take my share by gifting me something? You know we never do that. Where is she? Guys, let me go. Brother... Save me, brother. Guys, leave me. Let me go. What a sexy woman! Where are you, brother? Let me go, guys. 'The number you've called is switched off. Please try later.' -Where is she? -She's in there, sir. Good stuff! Here you go, sir. Save me, brother. Where are you, brother? Broker Sagar is downstairs. Lift her up. -Is our account settled? -Of course. Have fun! Brother... Brother... Bring her. Product is being shipped to Dubai tomorrow. Take care until then. Brother... Brother... Save me, brother. 'I was devastated to see Vennela like that.' 'I became a prostitute when someone sold me to Dubai long back.' 'I didn't want another girl's life to be ruined.' 'So I saved Vennela without Sagar's knowledge.' Brother... I called Vennela's brother after she became conscious. 'Rohit would risk his life to protect his sister.' 'When he saw her in that condition, he cried like a little baby.' 'That's when we decided to punish the bastards who ruined Vennela's life.' 'We pretended to be a couple and became Pavan's neighbors.' 'I made them believe that I lust them...' '...and took them out one day.' There's nobody here. Our pleasure will have no limits. -Whoever catches me first... -Me! Me! Me! -Let me do it. -No! Me! Me! They'll get to be with me first. Come on! Hurry up! Ready? One... Two... Three... Go! Pavitra, where are you? -Pavitra... -Pavitra, where are you? Hey, Pavitra! Where are you? -Pavitra... -Pavitra, where are you? Pavitra... Pavitra aunty's husband is here. He's not Pavitra aunty's husband. He's Grim Reaper for you. Vennela's brother. -So you are... -Yes! I am Vennela's brother. You should know why you're dying. Or there's no meaning to your death. You ruined my baby sister's life without any mercy. It's not just your sister. We make a living by trafficking woman to Dubai. Trafficking woman is your business? We're like this. We do whatever we want. We'll hang out, get drunk, rape and kill. It's our wish. That is why you deserve better punishment. I mean, assassination. You trap innocent girls in the name of love, manipulate them to sleep with you, take videos of that, blackmail them, strip them off of any courage left and for that, you deserve death. -Oh, yeah? Let's see. -Come at us! Kill them, Rohit! Stop! Where do you think you're going? Stop! Guys! He's killing! Let's go! Guys, let's go nab him. Rohit, stop! Rohit, cool! Rohit... Let them go. They're dead. After the three guys, we killed the driver who raped Vennela. The broker. David. We killed them as per plan. Only you're alive. We'll kill you as well. It's impossible for you to kill me! First, I'm going to kill you! Then I'm going to hunt down Rohit and kill him brutally. Stop right there, you bastard! Where do you think you're going? You're going to be dead today! She's a young girl, man. What has she done to you? Why did you rape that innocent girl? You think women are toys to play with? Aren't you going to spare any woman? You did it with these hands, right? Forgive me! I was under the influence when I did that. Spare me this once. Please! That innocent girl must have also begged you to let her go, right? She must have pleaded for her life. Rascal! Did you spare her? Huh? Rohit, don't let him go! Don't! Kill him! Just kill him! Die, you bastard! Kill him! I protected my sister with all my heart. I wanted to get her married to a good guy. I dreamt of giving her a happy life. But you shattered my dream. No other woman should suffer because of a man like you. Die! Just die! Let go, sir. Please. Please let go. -Hello. -Hello, police station. -Someone killed the CI and dumped his body near the outskirts. 'Falling in love isn't wrong.' 'But we aware of the kind of guy you fall in love with.' 'Many girls' lives are getting ruined because of love.' 'Thanks to a brother like Rohit and a humane prostitute like Pavitra...' 'Vennela was saved.' 'What about the girls who got nobody to save them?' 'So girls, be careful before falling in love.'
