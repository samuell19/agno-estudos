Emma. Emma! Are you in here? Emma! Emma! Are you in here? Hello? Is anyone in here? Hello, I'm looking for my daughter. Hello? Whoa, ha ha! Knife to see you too. When did you get home, I didn't hear you come in. I got home late last night, you were asleep. I didn't want to bother you, so I slept on the couch. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go ahead and take this out of your way. - All right. - Sorry. It's uh, nice to see you. Thought you'd be a little bit happier to see me. I am, I am, I'm just stressed, okay. - I'm so sick of your job. - Yeah, yeah. - You're never home. - I know, it sucks. - I get it. - It does. But hey, soon as I'm owner-operator, I can pick and choose my own hours, and I can come and go as I please. - It'll be all right, okay? - I know, I know. It's plan and it makes sense, but can't we do something else that includes you and me together most of the time? - Yeah, that's not gonna work. - Why won't it work? We'd get sick of each other, okay? All the same thing happens with all those guys out on the road and their significant others. They're always like, I love you, no I love you more, no I love you more and it's fucking sick, right? They never laugh, so okay, time together, time apart. That's the best way to do it, all right? My dad was never home whenever I when I was a kid. Right right right, they're still together, and then my mom... Okay, that was that generation, they never got divorced. Your mom probably hated it, too, and she was probably lonely and miserable most of the time. - She got a dog. - A dog? Yeah, a dog. Oh, you think a dog's gonna satisfy her needs? No, but batteries can; She had those, too. I am not talking about those needs. I'm talking about safety and security. What if someone breaks into the house? The Hogans got broken into last week, okay? Okay, well you won't like this, but why don't we just go on down to the shooting range? Shoot a gun, I don't wanna do that, no, no no, no no no. Another way. You handle the knife just fine. Don't make jokes, okay, I hate living alone. - I really hate it. - Okay, okay, babe, look. I got a baseball bat in the other room, all right? Somebody breaks in, go get it, knock their block off. Swing for the fences, I don't care. Just make sure it's not me, all right? - I love you. - I love you, too. When do you leave again? - Tonight. - Tonight? - Tonight. - Why tonight? - You just got home! - Babe, the money's great. I can't turn that down. Okay look, when I get back, after a couple of weeks, all right, - Mm hm. - I will take a break. - You say that. But then they'll throw more money at you and then you'll agree to it. - Babe. - What? I promise that when I get back I will take a break. All right, no more runs, for a little bit. - A little bit? - Yeah, a little bit. I promise. You think this is gonna work? I pinky-promise. Save that for those lot lizards. No no no, I don't let 'em in the truck anymore. Oh, really? Yeah, that last one had this big old dick and I had to learn the hard way. - Literally. - Okay, go. You're in the wrong neighborhood, baby. Not the talkative type? Oh, that's my type of girl. Oh, I like it rough. Please! It's a little late for that. Me too, I swear. You won't believe me. It doesn't matter, betrayed me. Please. Chad, Chad, wake up, wake up, wake up! - Wake up, wake up, wake up! - What, what, what, what, - what what, what what? - There is a weird lady - in our living room. - What? I don't know how to say this but there is a crazy lady sitting on our sofa watching TV and she has this creepy smile. - Okay, creepy smile. - Yes, creepy smile. Kind of like, uh. Oh, okay. No, I'm serious, can you please go look? I want her to go, she won't leave. Okay, I'll go, I'll check it out. - Go! - All right, yikes! She's better at the creepy-smile thing than you are. - I'm being serious. - Okay. Stop joking! Hey, what's up, whatcha doing here? Funny, she on drugs or something, I mean? You like the movie, I mean, is it your your kind of thing? Hey, hey, it's okay. It's gonna be all right, if you want I can, I can drive you somewhere, I could drop you off. Hey, what's your name? La Llorona. Whoa, no no, no no no. Okay, let her go, hey baby, you okay? I'm okay. Oh shit, okay, okay, I don't hit ladies. No, knock her out, Chad! Appears she's dead. Call an ambulance. What'd the cops say? Apparently they know her. She's been in the station like every day for the past week, looking for her daughter. So, she was crazy. No, they uh, they think that she was like popped up on like PCP or whatever, which gives you like superhuman strength, which she had, because I've never been thrown that hard at my entire life. You're not leaving tonight, are you? - Are you serious? - Okay, babe, I have to. All right, if I don't, they're screwed, okay? I cannot bail, I have to go. I don't want to be here alone tonight, it's creepy. Can you invite a friend over? No, all my friends have families. No one's gonna stay with me. Could you go stay with them? I'll figure it out. - You sound furious. - I'm not furious. I just, I get it. You're loyal to your job and you need to go. I want to be supportive, I'm good. - I'll make it work. - But as soon as I get back. - Hm. - We will go do something fun. All right, just you and me, I mean, we can drive up to Vegas, we could do whatever we want. - All right? - You promise? I promise. - All right, I gotta go. - Okay, bye. ♪ Ah ♪ You'll get your money next week! Father Gomez, it's me, let me in. There's no sermon today, what do you want? I bought new clothes, you want to see? Bought, you know it's a bad thing to lie to a priest. Okay fine, maybe not bought, but they're clean and I need to take a shower, please? All right. You really need to clean up your act. Why are you living like this? You're homeless and you're telling me to clean up? Yeah, I'm homeless, I have no options, you have a place. Heck, if I had this place, everything would sparkle and I'd smell nice every day. - The bathroom's over there. - I know. I know you know, that's my hint. Have you, go take your shower. ♪ Ah ♪ Bob? What are you doing here? - Can I come in? - It's late, I'm working. I could really go for a beer, Cassandra. One, fine. So where's Chad? Where do you think? Damn, I keep telling him to give up that shit job. He leaves you here all by yourself like this. It's gonna be a dangerous city. I'm a big girl and I have work to do. So you can get your beer and get going. I can get back to it. Hm, still doing that consulting stuff? Yes, I have a lot to do, so. Your beer. I always liked this house. You know, I was the one that told Chad to buy it. Yeah, he listens to me, can't go wrong. You know, I even told him that you were the one. - Did you know that? - No, I didn't. But, I don't care, you need to go, Bob. I'll tell Chad you stopped by. - You got another? - Leave, Bob. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm busy. Okay, okay, I get it. - I'm going. - Oh stop! - You need to go! - No. - No? - I'm not leaving. I keep thinking about that barbecue last summer when you gave me that hug, you kissed me on the cheek. I got your message. Chad doesn't appreciate what he has in you. He leaves you here by yourself all the time. I'd never do that. You have five seconds to get out of here or I'm gonna call him, you got that? - Go! - Cock-tease! Shit! Jennifer. I missed you in sermon today. I didn't go to church. Is there a problem? What is going on, my child? I just don't get it. What don't you get? I don't get how you could live without the touch of a woman. I mean, would God really send you to hell for just looking? Would He you care if you just reached out and touched me? This is very inappropriate, Jennifer. I made a vow and I stand by that vow. Okay, Father, whatever you want. I'm sorry if I offended you. You didn't offend me. You're just searching for something and you'll find it. I'll help you as much as I can. Great, because I really need your help. I can't do this, Jennifer, I can't. You don't have to do a thing. Just sit there and enjoy the ride. This is my game, Padre. You listen to my rules, you understand? Yes. Do you like my tits, Father? You're very blessed. Do you think I could teach Sunday school? Not like that, you couldn't, ah! Patience, Father, patience. I can't wait any longer, Jennifer. No? No. Well then, I guess I can give you a little taste. You are a weak, pathetic man. You have no true faith. You're a lie, you're a lie, you're a lie! Whew. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you got any money? Sorry, no pockets! - Wow. - Nothing I'm giving you. You got it, I'm gonna get it. - Help, help! - Hey you! Oh, fuck, fuck you and fuck you, you fucking whores. Fucking bitches. I am so glad you came along. It's not a good area, what the hell you doing here? Well, when I run, I sort of get in the zone and I just completely lost track of where I was going. You best start keeping track 'cause this city has some serious issues. What about you? What about me? Why are you here? Not much of a choice, really. I'm homeless, I live in tent city. I know that sounds kind of weird but do you want to come back with me? My boyfriend's a trucker and he is always on the road. I could really use some company. You mean like, sleep over? Yeah, kind of, my boyfriend said to move a friend in and you just saved my life, so you're kind of my best friend right now, what do you say? Okay, but if at any time you need me to leave, I'm right out that door, I don't want to impose. Okay, cool. I'm sorry, Jennifer, I'm so sorry. I know I should have been stronger for you. Been there for you and been the mentor that you needed. I know you're in a better place. You certainly deserve it more than I do. - Hello. - Hello, Father. What are you doing? I'm just talking to a lost friend. It makes me feel better to speak to her sometimes. How did she pass? It was a very sad thing. She had a demon that got the best of her. I wish I could have done more to help to her battle him. - You're probably right. - What? To you, she was just a sexual object to use and throw away, right? Who are you? You called me a lost friend, remember? What, you don't find me attractive anymore? So, you've had real shit luck, then? You got that dude in the alleyway and then your boyfriend's pal coming over here to get you? His best pal, I don't know how to break it to him. Well, you better break it to him or else that asshole's gonna tell him you came on to him. I bet you're right, unreal. I have another issue I want to talk to you about and I wouldn't be surprised if you walked right out that door. Well, it better be really bad because I really, really like your house. Um, a woman broke into my house a little while ago and died right here, I didn't know her or anything. I just think she was crazy and she fell - and broke her neck. - Wow. - Yeah. - That's insane. Yeah, but it gets crazier. I think she's haunting me or something. Strange things are happening. Like what? Cabinets opening and closing, chairs being stacked up and I'm getting these really scary images that are just screwing with my head. Well, her spirit sounds restless and you need to put it to rest. - How do we do that? - I don't know. But, um, I have a friend. - He's a priest. - Mm hm. Maybe he can come and like bless this place or something. Yeah sure, I mean, if he can, that would be great. For sure, first thing tomorrow. - Maybe he's not home. - He's always home. I don't even think they allow him to leave. It's sort of like house arrest. Father Gomez, I need to talk to you, I know you're in there. Get off your ass and open the door. I thought today was going to be a good day. Now that I see you, Tiffany, I'm guessing all my hopes and dreams are for naught. That's what I love about you, Father. You're always really great at uplifting spirits. That's what I do what. What? - Vodka? - Coffee. Oh well, that's a nice change of pace. Can you please tell me why you're here and what do you want? This is my friend Cassandra. And we have some serious business to talk to you about, but we can't do it out here. - Why not? - It's personal. Come on in. You girls want coffee? No, thanks. Okay, what can I help you two with? I don't know the best way to say this, um. But her house is haunted. - Haunted? - Mm hm. Okay, maybe I do need some vodka in this cup. All right, why do you think your house is haunted? A woman died in my house a little while ago and since then, strange things have been happening. Things moving on their own, cabinets opening and closing, and I'm getting these really strange visions. I think her spirit is restless. Anyway, everything's been happening since she died. How did she die? Well, my boyfriend hit her and she fell and broke her neck. Why did your boyfriend have to hit her? He couldn't just out-muscle her? Hold her until the police got there? I think she was on drugs or something. Chad is strong, but she overpowered him. Okay, this is what I think. You had a traumatic experience. You're having a hard time coping with it. That would explain the visions and the weird activity. It's all in your head. You need to see a psychiatrist, not a priest. Father, can you at least go check it out? I'm sorry, Tiffany. I would, if I thought it was something to help with. You do understand there's no concrete proof that hauntings even occur, it's our mind playing with us. Don't you believe in demons and like possessions and shit? Aren't you a priest? You're supposed to believe in that stuff, aren't you? Times change, why do you think I don't practice anymore? All that superstitious stuff is nonsense. You'll get a better grasp on life if you ignore all that hocus-pocus. - What happened to you? - I grew up. I'm sorry, ladies, I have things to do. I'd like you to leave. - Father? - What? After this lady died, I think she's still in the house. She didn't call herself by her name. She's strong and she's possessed and she's not leaving. What does she call herself? Let me guess, Satan, devil, what? La Llorona. Oh, I'm sorry, I have arthritis. It's hard for me to hold on to things. That's not true, the minute I said her name, you freaked. I did not freak, like I said, go see a psychiatrist. There is no ghost, there is no demons. You live, you die, you disappear from this world. I'd like you two to leave. Oh, oh! So, La Llorona was a woman who had a husband that traveled. He fell out of love with her and then found a new woman. So she killed herself and then he killed her kids. So she's stuck in limbo. Why would this freak out your priest friend like that? Maybe because he's knows it's more than a story. So what's our next move? You know, when I was a teenager, I would have like sleepovers and stuff, like we would always make this like handmade Ouija board thing to contact spirits. - Did it work? - No, but we had fun. But at least here we know we have someone to contact. Maybe we'll get lucky, I say we try it. - Ghosts like candles? - Who doesn't like candles? - So what we do now? - We talk to La Llorona. Place your fingers on the glass. What do we ask? La Llorona, are you here? Huh, yes. Um, what do you want? Free, she's trapped. How can we help you be free? How can we help you be free, Llorona? What can we do? We want to help you, how can we help you? Oh. Die! What the hell just happened? What are you doing? I gotta clean it up before Chad gets home. What's wrong? Babe, you moved in a fucking homeless person. - She was... - Am I the only one that's concerned about this, seriously? She risked her life to save mine. It's the least I could do. Okay, did you stop and think that maybe these two are in on some shit, that it's a fucking scam? - It's not like that. - It's not? - No! - Okay, first of all, she shows up out of nowhere wherever this guy randomly shows up out of nowhere as well. Okay and then secondly, now she's in here telling you that this place is fucking haunted? All right, what's next, she's gonna ask for like what, like $10,000 to cleanse the spirits or whatever? - Just watch, all right? - You don't even know her. - Babe. - What? She goes tomorrow, all right? Either you tell her or I do. You asked me to move someone in, so I did. And then you act like this. Babe, I meant a friend. Somebody that you know, all right? Not some junkie scam artist. She is a friend. Where are you going? I'm sleeping on the couch tonight, you're being a dick. Suit yourself. I want you, Chad. Hey, Cass, baby I'm sorry I wasn't there. I was being such an asshole. Hey, sug. Fuck, shit, fuck that, okay. Hey. Hey. Good morning, how'd you sleep? Better'n you, I guess. Why sleep on two hard chairs when you have a bed? Yeah, so what was that seance shit that you guys were doing last night? What the fuck was that about? Why, what did you see? All right, I need some caffeine in my vein if I'm gonna say what I need to say. There's enough in your veins yet? So there was some real paranormal shit going on in my room last night. What happened, doors slam, chairs stack on top of each other, strange noises? Creepy demon lady trying to fuck me and then laughing me out of my room. Do you mind if I grab a cup of coffee? Yeah, please do. Please, Lord, look out for them, make them able to handle the battle they're about to encounter. Make them stronger than me, please Lord, make them stronger than I am. So I was dealing with my mom's new boyfriend and he kept trying to do stuff with me. So I had to run, I had no choice. I ended up in the streets and I've been there ever since. That was when you were 15? No, I was 14. Damn. I was playing Xbox and ordering pizza on Friday night when I was 14. - I'm sorry. - Everyone has their paths. Destiny isn't fair and, I mean, there will always be good detours along the journey and I'm planning on a happy ending. All right, here's to happiness coming before the end. You two seem to be getting along. Yeah, hey, um. - What? - I'm sorry about last night. You should be. Aren't you gonna make this easy on me? No, watching new grovel is one of my favorite things. I can't have you deprive me of that. So, what was the topic a conversation this morning? Um, something happened last night that's a little unexplainable. - He saw La Llarona. - Okay, so it is explainable. - Where? - I saw her in the bedroom. I thought it was you and then you came in, but you were it and all this shit, she started screaming at my face. It was just a lot, there's a lot of freaky shit going around this fucking house, okay? Yes, that's what we were trying to tell you last night. We tried to get rid of her, but it didn't work. So we just need to figure out the proper way to do it. Whoa, babe, babe, hey, you okay, hey? - I'm good. - Are you all right? Yeah, just, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I just tripped. - I'm okay. - All right. I just think I'm a little overwhelmed by everything. I just need a minute to catch my breath and then I'm good to go. Go to hell, you demons, go back to hell! Fuck. Yeah Steve, what's up dude? What, no dude, I just got back, man, no no no no, look. Hey, I need some time, I need, no no no no, I. What? No man, are you seriously threatening my job right now? No no, fine, man, all right, fine, when is the shipment? Dude, I would have to leave in the morning. Are you kidding me? No, I don't care about the money, Steve, are you? No, look man. As of right now, I am seeking employment elsewhere, all right? I will do the job, but you don't fucking own me, Steve. I know, baby, I know, no, come on. Who is she? What? You heard me. You're gone all the time, you just got back and now you're leaving again, who is she? Babe, I'm not seeing anybody. The only thing I'm seeing is a warehouse, all right? I gotta go pick up the product to take it to them so they can make safety glass or whatever it is, all right? That's where I'm going, that's what I'm doing. I'm going... Bullshit. I'm going to, oh god. So, you're not cheating on me? Baby, never, I would never, no, no. Hey, I promise, we're in for the long haul, remember? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay, well then, will you tell that fat shit Steve to shove it up his ass? Yeah, I will tell fat shit Steve to shove it up his ass. As soon as I get back, okay? - I love you. - I love you. Now turn your light off. Cuddle me. Dear God, please help Jennifer Clark to rest in peace and stop haunting my dreams. I visit her grave often to help pray for her soul. Please help me to save her soul, my Lord. And also, God, please give me the strength to get La Llorona out of my head. Keep me clear on a path of righteousness. Banish La Llorona and save Jennifer's soul. That is all that I pray, my God. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Chad on a mission? - Yep, and when he gets back, he's gonna tell that fat shit Steve to shove it up his ass. It's time for something new. You going out for a run? Isn't that obvious, you want to come with me? I have some running clothes you can wear. Nah, me and running do not get along. Hey, suit yourself, I'll be back in a bit, lock the doors. Oh yeah, yeah, now you're all mine. - Help, help me! - Help me, help me. - Help me! - Nobody can help you. Cops don't come around here, nobody comes around here. You shouldn't... Let me go! Came around here, damn, there we go. - Let me go! - There we go. There we go, yeah, yeah, there we go. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. There we go. Maybe if you just suck it a little bit, I won't kill... Oh, oh, you fucking bitch! I'm gonna fuck you up, bitch! Cassandra, what's wrong? I don't know, look at my hands, you can still see it. What, I don't see anything. I must have gotten all the blood off, then. The blood, what are you talking about? It's a lemonade? My mother used to call this medicine. Whenever she was stressed out, she drank her medicine. You need your medicine. I can't argue with that logic. I was in tent city again and I don't know how I got there. I'm drawing a huge blank. I was in the alley again, just sitting there and my hands were covered in blood. But I didn't do it, Tiffany, it wasn't my blood. You were in a virtual dump, that's what the alley is. People throw their garbage everywhere. Probably wasn't even blood, it was probably just ketchup from some french fries someone threw there. I don't know, I think I'm going crazy. Maybe all this stuff happening to the house, to Chad, to me, is a result of my madness. Like I am conjuring it up somehow. There's no such thing as the Force... - You sure? - My friend. You're just stressed and your brain's having a hard time computing. You need to go somewhere, get away. I can't afford it. My business has been slowed down to a crawl and Chad's only been behind the wheel for a year. We are scraping by. See, it's more stress, it's all stress, did you know that stress is the number one killer? No, I didn't. That's why smoking makes all the sense in the world. I'm lost. - Smoking relieves stress. - Yes? And by eliminating stress, you are eliminating the biggest killer, make sense? That's absurd, you know what I'm thinking is that you and me our long-lost sisters. You are just as absurd as I am. Come here, I love you, girl. You know I have your back. If you killed someone, I'd help you bury the body, - you know that, right? - Likewise, I guess. I think I'm gonna go visit my doctor in the morning just to make sure everything is okay. I hope he's hot. Oh, he's in the 60s, okay? Oh, a silver fox, I like those. Shit. Fuck. Yes, Steve. Steve, I think your butt down. All right, man. All right, enjoy your, enjoy your chick flick or whatever it is. God, fucking. Hello. Hello, is anyone there? Is everything okay? All right, Steve, look man. Unless you absolutely need me, don't call me, all right? I need to get my rest. Actually, no, I'll turn this one off, that's better. Take that, Steve. Piece of shit. Fuck! Shit! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, the power of Jesus Christ, by the power of Jesus Christ, I demand you that you leave me the fuck alone, all right! Yeah, you don't like that, no no, okay. By the power of Jesus Christ, I demand that you leave me alone, that you go back to hell from where you came, all right. Just let me out of this, all right. Just let me out of this, all right. I demand you go back to hell by the power of Jesus Christ, I demand that you leave me alone. - Tiffany, Tiffany! - What? - I'm pregnant. - Oh my god, that's insane. - I know. - Are you doing okay? I don't know, I'm super-nervous and super-excited so. It's just a lot. Have you told Chad yet? No, he didn't answer his phone. So you're the first person to know. Well, outside my doctor and me, you're the first. - Wow, so... - I know, thank you. So what did the doctor say about all the stuff you were seeing. He said that all women go through this in different ways and it could just be my body reacting to the major changes I'm going through. So maybe I'm not so crazy after all. Crazy, but not certifiable. Exactly, I'm gonna try to call Chad again. I know he's sleeping after a long night of driving, but I'm gonna try him anyway. You go do that. Hello? What? What, no! What's wrong? I just got off the phone with Chad's boss. What happened, is everything okay? Did something happen to Chad? He's dead, they found him in his hotel room. They think somebody killed him. Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'm so goddamn sorry. You tell me what you need, girl. Anything, just tell me what it is. They need me to go to Nevada to identify the body. I don't think I can drive. I don't think I can make it. Done, I'll drive you, I got you. We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning. - Hey. - Hey, good morning. Are you doing okay? Yeah, oh I'm doing great. You know, I was thinking for breakfast, what if we did pancakes, wouldn't that be good? - Little maple syrup? - I mean, I guess we can get some out on the road. We have to leave soon, right, to Nevada? Mm, I don't think so, 'cause you know what? Chad had his ID on him and they can identify the body that way. Also, you can't live in the past. See you in the kitchen? You're in shock. You need to identify the body, you need closure. No, I'm fine, Tiffany, you know what? I think it may be a good thing. He was always on the road anyway, right? And probably had a girl on the side. What is all this about, I'm totally lost here? Don't be, we don't need men. This was like God stepping in and saying, Cassandra, continue on your own journey, so I did. Everything happens for a reason. Oh hi, Tiffany. Hey, it's midnight, where were you? What's with the weird getup? Do you like it? Oh, I was out. Chad's dead, I'm not, so I gotta get back in the mix. You know, I'm saying this as a friend, Cassandra. I think you need help. Do you want to speak to a professional? A shrink, really? Do you realize the most screwed-up people get degrees in psychology? Those people can't even save themselves. I mean, I'll go with you. What's the worst that can happen? Hm, I really appreciate the invite. I'm gonna have to decline, you know what? Why don't you go and then you can tell me all about it. Tomorrow morning actually, I have to take off for a bit. I won't be long, you'll be okay by yourself? I'm a big girl now. I can handle myself. - What? - You will not believe what I just saw, I mean, I really need your help this time. - You have to believe me. - Come in here. Tell me all about it. We need your help, Father. I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore. I'm not the guy, I never was. Bullshit, you're scared, that's your problem. You're a coward. Maybe so, but like I said, I'm not the guy. I can't face it again, I can't. What do you mean, again? Years ago, La Llorona presented herself to me. She cover up with a poor woman in my congregation. She came to me, and I didn't help her. I'm sure you tried. No, I tried to help myself. I gave in to her seduction. La Llorona knows your weaknesses, knows how you tick, knows how to exploit you and who to corrupt. I would not be able to stop her or save your friend. I'm sorry. Yeah, you are sorry. You're the sorriest piece of shit that I know. You sit here all alone, watching the freaking world pass by, afraid that somebody is gonna come hurt you. You're a priest, meant to do good. And now's your chance. I'm just asking you to do what you're supposed to do, dammit! It's not that easy, Tiffany, it's not. I can't just send La Llorona to hell. I can't exorcise a demon. Cassandra welcomed her in and when you let her in, getting her out is impossible. What do you mean, welcomed her in? La Llorona can be very seductive. She can be helpful and solve a lot of problems. You see, she feeds on the weak, and once you submit to her, she owns you. Your friend going through all that stuff, she's a prime target for her. And I don't think she wants her out. Cassandra might like the power too much. What happens if we don't get rid of La Llorona? What happens to Cassandra? She dies, okay, she dies! La Llorona kills the host systematically. She drives them mad and once they die, she finds another. There's no stopping her. You need to stay out of her way. And that's what I'm going to do, is what you should do. Cut your losses. Cassandra is pregnant. - What? - She's going to have a baby. Now I'm gonna go and try and see if I can save her myself and I'm going to try to save that kid. I'm going to face that demon and if it means I die trying, then so be it. So you just sit here, safe under your blankets. But you'll have to explain to your Maker why you hid and ran when the devil came knocking. Where is she now? At work, until 7:00. You're right, you're right. I've been running long enough. Been running my entire life. No more, damn it, no more. Let's send this bitch back to hell. I'll see you at the house at 7:00. Where were you, I was waiting forever! I did some deep prayer before I got here. You didn't do that out on the road? It's dangerous to pray and drive. Now, how is she? She's happy, but that's not the Cassandra I know. It's not her, that's La Llorona controlling her. You're just seeing the shell of Cassandra. It's time to get her back. Hello, Father, nice to see you. Tiffany, where were you, I was getting lonely. Cassandra, how are you feeling? You're not a doctor, you're a priest. My doctor says I'm fine, so thank you for stopping by, but I have things to do. You know where the door is. You seem to be dealing with the death of your boyfriend quite well. Why should I be upset, Father? He's in a better place, right? By the way, Tiffany, you mooched off me long enough. It's time for you to go, all right? It's gonna get a little intense. I can't have any distractions. Go in the back room, I'll call you if I need you. Are you sure? I have no certainty. But I do know we're on the right side of this and that has to mean something. Planning an exorcism, Father? - Not really. - Hm. I was just hoping you'd leave this girl's body and save us both a lot of trouble. No can do, but I'll tell you what. Maybe you and I can have some fun, what do you say? I can tell you want this body. - No. - No? You need to leave this woman alone, you don't need her. I don't need her. I want her. I want you. What does God have for time for you? Just give in, you have led such miserable life. I can make you happy. I can make you really happy. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and God we confidently undertake to repulse the attacks and the deceit of the devil. We drive out from among us all unclean spirits, all satanic powers, all infernal invaders, all wicked legions, assemblies, and sex. I cast you out, unclean spirit. The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. It's not gonna work, Gomez, you fuck. Cassandra, stop, I know that's you in there. It will be my pleasure gutting you. You have to beat it, okay? You let her in, you can let her out. - No. - Cassandra. You're the only good thing in my life and I need you back. You're the strongest person I know. You can fight it, now dammit, just fight it. I cast you out, unclean spirit. The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. Get Cassandra and get the hell out of here, now! I won't leave you. Damn it, girl, this is your chance to save that baby, save your friend, you got seconds, do it now! - Come on. - Okay. You know, years ago I thought you destroyed me. I look forward to facing you again. It won't help you. I said, do it. You want somebody, take me, do it, do it. Oh, oh, oh! I'll see you in hell! ♪ Ah ♪ I just felt something, feel it? - Oh my god, can I feel it? - Yeah. - There it is. - I feel it! - Little feet. - Yeah, it's kicking. I see one, two, three, four, five shells. Oh my god, five months. Good. I'm doing okay. - Eating all the right food. - Sleeping well? Yeah. ♪ Oh ♪ So you popped her right out, huh? Popped her out, I can't believe I did it. She's a little girl, I'm a mom, Tiffany, I did it. So where's the little rugrat? Ah, they're giving her the once-over to make sure all the bells and whistles work. - But healthy? - As a horse. Oh, I'm so happy for you. Gosh, I can't wait to meet her. - What did you name her? - Tiffany. After my best friend. No way, oh my god. And if it was a boy, I was going to name him after Father Gomez. You two saved me. I love you to pieces, girl. I love you too, thank you. I can't thank you enough for letting me be a part of your life and your daughter's life. Of course. There she is. I've got a healthy little girl who really wants to see her mommy. Oh my gosh. I'll let you get to know each other. If you need me, ring me. Thank you, I really appreciate it. - You've been the best. - My pleasure. Oh my god, look at the little munchkin! Oh, I probably shouldn't be so loud. - I'll probably wake her. - That's fine. Babies sleep like what, 16 hours a day? Plenty of time to sleep, you're fine. All right, if you say so. Hi, little Tiffany. I love you so much and you have a really great mommy. You're making me emotional. I want to be a strong mom for her, she needs it. Fine fine, you're right. Isn't she beautiful?
