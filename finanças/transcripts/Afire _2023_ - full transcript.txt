AFIRE Something's not right. What? It's misfiring. I can't hear it. Got a signal? No. How far is it? It's quite a way. -How far? -10 kilometres... to the village, then 2 kilometres... to the house. At least. I know a short cut. -Which way? -Through the woods It's 2-3 km at most. -Are you sure? -Yes. Are we lost? We go right, I think. I'm pretty sure. Felix, it'll be dark soon. If we go the wrong way we'll have to sleep out here. Listen, you stay here with our stuff. -And I'll go and check. -Felix! It can't be far. Shit. Felix? Hello. It's not far now. 15 minutes. Great. Hello? Hello? I'll call my mum. Now you tell me? I can't believe it, Mum! It's always the same! It's my fault? Seriously? Don't piss me off! I have two pieces of bad news. Is that lasagne? I love lasagne! -Okay, tell me. -We won't be alone. -The whole time? -Looks that way. Typical Mum: "Sorry, didn't I tell you? But there's loads of space! " Yes... She says hi. Give you a hug, she said. And the second thing? We have to share a room. -What? -She's in the other room. No! Shit, Felix! need peace and quiet. need somewhere to work alone. And you have to finish your portfolio. You can have the pergola. -What pergola? -The one outside. You'll be all alone. She's a good cook. -Do you know her? -M-hm. She's the niece of my mum's workmate. And her name? -Nadja. -A Russian? I don't know. Hello Nadja, Leon and me, Felix, have arrived. We'll sleep in the small room. -The small room? -Yes. -But there's two of us! -It's not much smaller. I'm starting to hate that woman. I'm going over there. What's their fucking problem? Leave them be. She probably didn't see the note. The roof's got a leak. Look up there. That's not good. It'll damage the wall. Then it'll go mouldy. I need to sleep. I have to work tomorrow. You too. Were you spying on her? Don't be silly. It looked that way. Did you talk to her? No. What does she look like? I couldn't see, she was too far away. Are you okay? Get yourself a bowl, or... Are you cleaning up her mess? -Want to come swimming? -No. I have to work. What about you? What do you mean? Your work. I need to settle in first Hey. See you later. Shit. Hey, stop it! The sea's fantastic. Leon? Come here. Come up here for a sec. I need your help. Come on! Here, look at this. There. The leak's here. My dad fitted this roof. It must be the heat I mean, look at it. It needs repairing -Now? -If not, mould will get in the walls. -That would be a disaster. -I have a deadline. You too. Let's do the important things first. -Your portfolio and my manuscript. -It'll take an hour. Two, tops. -It'll be fun. -Laying asphalt? Yes, and the smell... I really like it. -What time is it? -About four. -When do the shops shut? -During the season, 8 p.m. -How long will it take to get there? -Ten minutes. With a car. But we don't have a car, and we don't have any food. So we'll go and buy some food And you find a garage to fix the car. Here! And now, watch out... Throw it! Come on! Sorry. -What's that? -For Najda. 100 We ate hers. Here. 92.88. Card or cash? -Card. -We have to lug all this stuff! Ask her if there's a garage or a tow service. Okay. Excuse me, is there a tow service or a garage around here? Our car broke down on the road. You can try the AA but they won't come because of the fires. What about the garage by the roundabout? They don't do repairs anymore. This is an important announcement! Due to the forest fires, we must urgently inform you that all camp fires, barbecues, and also smoking in or near forests is strictly prohibited. In Waldhut forest, the blazes are... -Where is Waldhut forest? -In the West. -How far away? -30 km. At least. ... the L673 and A2 are closed. Travellers to or from a westerly... Shall we go for a swim? It'll be dark soon. So what? What's the subject? For art school. Or isn't there one? Water. Water? That's not a subject. Of course it's a subject. It's an element. Did you choose it? No. We were given it. -Got any ideas yet? -The sea. -The sea? -I want to photograph the sea. Are you setting a place for the Russian? Felix! 00HOUJ Are you coming? I have to work. Why do you always say "work"? Fixing the roof is work. Or fixing the car. Cooking, washing -All that is work. -Are you saying that writing isn't work? That it's for weaklings or some bullshit? -Are you coming for a swim? -No. I've had enough! -Do you like it? -Not so loud! -Could it be that you kind of like it? -Maybe. -Want my headphones? -No! I don't sleep with headphones. -Got any insect spray? -You're sleeping outside? Are you staying here? Good morning. Morning. Just got up? Coffee? I slept outside a few nights ago too. It was lovely. The gnats are annoying, but you have spray. -Can you smell it? -No. I'm Nadja. Thanks. Oh, I'm Leon. -I know. -I didn't sleep out there by choice. It was too loud inside. The last two nights. -I wanted to... -We already discussed it. What? Felix passed on your complaint. I see -That's fine, then. -I'm sorry. The walls must be very thin. It won't happen again. I'd like to make dinner for you two tomorrow. If it's convenient. Tomorrow evening? -Yes, Felix is cooking today -I'm cooking today. -Okay, yeah. -Great! I have to go to work. -See you later. -Bye. -Got any milk? -Milk? See you tonight. -What does she do? -I don't know. She's nice. Are you coming for a swim? Great! You coming in? Nadja's lover is a lifeguard. The guy up there? Really? Last night's lover at least. -Did you two talk? -No, about what? -Well, how do you know? -I saw him last night. Is that good? It's fantastic. Want to stay much longer? -Do you want to go? Soon. Are you responsible here? -For this section of beach? -Yes. -You're a lifeguard, right? -Rescue swimmer. Can I come up? I covered you up. You should put cream on if you lie in the sun for hours. -What time is it? -Almost four. -Shit! -I have to start cooking Wait for me, I'll come too. You didn't even have a swim. Don't you want to? -No. -I'll wait for you. No, I don't want to I invited Devid. -The lifeguard? -His name is Devid. With an "e". It's an old GDR quirk. Like "Maik" with "ai". Shit. You could have woken me up! You were fast asleep. I didn't want to wake you. The whole night outside! I barely got a wink of sleep I have an idea for my portfolio. -Want to hear it? -Yeah, sure. I said I wanted to photograph the sea. But now I've decided to photograph people looking at the sea. A series of portraits of people looking at the sea. Portraits? If you take portraits of people looking at the sea... ... they'll look at you. -Not necessarily. Of course! You'll be holding a camera in front of them. They know you have a camera, so they're not simply gazing at the sea. -They're posing for a photo. -I discussed that with Devid. Devid said he walks by the shore every morning on his way to the lookout and sees people blissfully gazing out to sea. Later, from the lookout, he sees the same people from behind. So what? I took a few test shots. Just a sec... Here, look. Use that to scroll. -Did you just take these? -Yes, while you were asleep. I like this one. Look. First with the sea in the background, then the portrait from the front. I still don't get it. They aren't looking at the sea. -They're looking at you. -But the first photo is from behind! Then I show them looking at the sea, and ask if I can take one from the front. Yes... Is he seeing Nadja? I don't know. -Didn't you even ask? -Why should I? Yes. Yeah, okay... Yes, I can do that. Sure. The hotels aren't very full. Because of the fires. The beach is quite empty as well. I'm sure I can find something. Okay. Have you read the ending yet? Yes, I really liked it. What about Lars, the new character? He kind of adds a... Sure, we can do it here. There's a pergola where we can work... And the title? What do you think of it? Yes, sure. I see. I'll call you when I find something. -Go and get him. Dinner's ready. -Okay. Bye. Leon? Hi, I'm Devid. Hi. -I saw you at the beach today. -Yes, I saw you too. You were asleep. Felix covered you up. You have to be careful. The sun in June can really burn. Felix told me you're an author. They asked me to tell you that dinner's ready. -Yes, I'll be right there. Thanks. -Okay... -Can you open the wine? -Yes. With the... Here, you do it. I can't. So... It was the last night and we felt a bit like partying. And eventually it was just Sonja and me left sitting at the long bar. Sonja was from Chiemsee, she was a rescue swimmer there. She was stunningly beautiful. mean, really beautiful. And we'd had a few drinks, and... we were kind of flirting. Well, I was. I thought to myself: You can't do this. I have a wife and a five-month-old child at home, and I'm fooling around with this Bavarian beauty... But then Sonja laughed and I was... Well, I was totally mesmerized. And then... Then the waiter says. "We're knocking off now." The bar was closing. And... can't remember exactly, but I asked Sonja if she'd like to help me empty the minibar in my room. So we go upstairs. When we get there, I go to the minibar to mix something and from the corner of my eye, I see Sonja taking off her shoes. Then she lay down on the bed and looked at me, her feet bare. Such beautiful feet... I thought, if I go over there now and make love to her, it'll ruin everything: my marriage, my family, everything. And I was about to say, "Come on Sonja, one more drink and then... you go back to your room." I wouldn't have cared a bit if she'd thought I was a wimp. Not one bit. Then there's a knock at the door. A loud, forceful knock at the door. was sure it was-my wife standing there holding our child. I sort of resigned myself to my fate and opened the door. And there... standing before me is... a short Arab man with a moustache, holding something rolled up. "Your rug! " I say to him, "Sorry, but you've got the wrong room." He says again, "This is your rug! " And holds out this rolled-up rug And I say again, "But you've got the wrong room! " Then I close the door, turn around, and Sonja is still lying there. But now it's all gone. All the magic, all the desire. And I'm about to tell Sonja that she should leave and then there's another knock. I open the door and the guy with the rug is there again. This time he yells at me, "This is your rug! Your rug!" You see? By now I was a bit angry at the Arab and his shitty rug. But I was also angry at myself for almost cheating on my wife at the first chance. So I yell at him to fuck off with his fucking rug. Right? And he said... that if I don't accept the rug right now, he'll spray me gay. And I was like, "Huh? What? " And he said, "Yes, I'll spray you gay. I'll spray you gay. I think to myself, "Yeah, okay..." Then I slam the door. And I say to Sonja, "Leave. Really, I mean it. Just leave." And then there's another knock at the door. And... I'm not a bruiser, but I open the door and all I want to do is punch him in the face. And he's standing there with a can in his hand, and he sprays me from head to toe. -And then? -This strange stuff came out. It had this really strange smell. It wasn't unpleasant. Not at all. On the contrary... It's funny, because I was wearing this very same shirt. I've washed it ten times and the smell is still there. Smell it. Yes, that's... Great. With all the details and stuff. -Yes... Are there actually lifeguard congresses? -No, of course not. No, and I'm not married, either. -And I've never been to Hamburg -I see. -Is there a lifeguard apprenticeship? -"Rescue swimmer". Isn't it the same thing? No. And what do you do? Well... you do a swimming award, there's an exam, and a special first aid course. Do you learn all the calls like, "No diving from the edge" and stuff? The sea has no edges. -How much do you earn? -You want to apply? God, no! I'm just curious. Yes. But why? What do you do out of season? Indoor pools? -No. -Why not? adidas I feel claustrophobic in indoor pools. I feel claustrophobic in indoor pools. -Oh? -Yes. It's psychological. -It wasn't easy doing the exam inside -Must be lots of girls... Stop it! -What's wrong? -Good question! What's wrong with you? What's wrong? -Good question! What's wrong with you? I fancy a swim. Good idea. Come on, we can clear up later. Aren't you coming? No. I can't. Come on. No, really. My work won't allow it. Okay. Too bad. "My work won't allow it." What an arsehole! I'm such an arsehole! Come up here. Devid? Leon, come up here. You should see this. -What is it? -Come up here! It's scary, isn't it? Yes. The fire's out of control. We're lucky the wind is blowing from the sea. But things look bad in Marlow. They might evacuate the area. This is our nicest room, it's usually booked until September. You're lucky, there was a cancellation. Does that happen a lot? It's the fires. But they're under control now. Here you go. -We call this suite our writer's room. -Why's that? Uwe Johnson often used to stay here. Excuse me. Yes, okay. I'll be right down. I have to go downstairs. Feel free to take a look around. THE THIRD BOOK ABOUT ACHIM AHRENSHOOP ARTISTS' COLONY Hi. Yes, it's nice here. Apparently Uwe Johnson used to stay here. Or Uwe Johnson, as they call him here. Yes. Uwe Johnson. Yes, I... Yes, you have to take the motorway from Rostock... Yes. Yes, fine. I'll just... I'll just book it, then. -What are you two having? -I'd like one scoop of smurf flavour. Smurf flavour for you? In a cone or a cup? -Cone. -In a cone? Here, one for you. I want what she had. Okay, coming up. You can try something else next time. That's stracciatella. -Hi. -Hi. Peanut flavour is really tasty. They call it "snickers" here. If you like... You get two scoops. The boss isn't here. I'm not a big ice cream fan. I could get you an espresso. It's surprisingly good here. -No, thanks. I have to go. Work... -... won't allow it? If you wait, I'll be off soon. We can go together. I really have to go. Some other time. Okay. Too bad. See you later. -Shit! -Hey! Finished work? -This happens all the time lately -What? -That I just fall asleep. -Working too hard? You've got quite a load. What was all that yesterday? -What do you mean? -Last night. Come on! You were so wound up -I was wound up? -Yes. Why did you attack Devid? -didn't -Yes, you did. I didn't think so. These things need to go in the fridge -Shit! -Are you okay? Yes! Oh, what's that? Goulash. Can it be saved? -Seriously? -Yes, it's delicious. The bag's ripped. Put the ripped one in the blue bag. Oh, yes Shit! -Did you hurt yourself? -No, I'm fine You have some goulash... Other side. And there too. -It's really tasty. -I told you so. -And there... -Thanks. Nadja? -You were right, by the way. -About what? Devid. I did give him a hard time And why? Oh... It doesn't really have much to do with him. Then what? I wrote a book. My second. Well, it's only a manuscript. The publisher thinks it's shit. He's coming tomorrow to give me an earful. He's coming here just for that? It sounds more as if he likes it. He says things like "exciting", "promising", "it has potential" and shit like that. Maybe I'm a bit sensitive, but... it makes me angry and upset and... That's maybe why I was a bit nasty to Devid. What's your book called? -"Club Sandwich". -"Club Sandwich"? Shit, I knew it! I should never have told you No, it's a good title. It didn't sound that way. -"Club Sandwich"? -I didn't say it like that. Just forget it. -Can I read it? -What? -Can I read it? -Certainly not! Don't get me wrong, but one misplaced remark, one stupid comment... -In a situation like this... -It's fine I don't know how to explain it. Felix's mum had a cleaning lady and I told her about a story I'd written, and at the end all she said was, "A bit schmaltzy." I was plagued by doubt for weeks and when the publisher comes... It's okay. I understand. I have to put this in the fridge. I'm sorry! Shit. Take the bigger one. -The bigger one... -They're the same size. Lay it out straight. -It's hot. Hot! -Yes. Nadja? wanted to ask if you'd maybe like to take a look... at this after all? Your schmaltzy book? I was stupid. Sorry. I didn't mean to lump you and the cleaning lady together. I've been stupid lately. Okay. -Give it here. -Right now? -That's it, right? -Yes. -You wanted to give it to me. -Yes. -You want to read it right now? -Sure. It's not that long. 134 pages. Can you put that in the fridge? I'll get started. -Yes, of course. -Cool. Grab this. -Want to go back in? -No way! Wow, it's so hot. It's too much for me. Leon? Felix and I are going for a swim. So if you want... Yes, maybe later. -I'm waiting for Nadja. -Is she here? Yes, in her room. She's reading. -Oh. -I said he wouldn't come. Leon might come. He's waiting for Nadja. -Where is she? -In her room. Reading. Your book? Really? -You let her? -Yes. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Nothing. Let's go. -Before it gets dark. -Your camera? In my rucksack. Well? You didn't like it? No. Could you be more specific? You know it's crap -I'll make the goulash. We can talk later. -I'm going for a swim. Fuck! Of course she doesn't get it. Bloody ice-cream seller! Shit! -Leon, shall I warm up some goulash? -No, thanks. I'm not hungry. The walls here really are thin. -What are you doing here? -lt seems my room is occupied. -Felix offered me his bed. -What about the sofa? I was going to sleep there, but it's full of gnats. So who's in there? Who do you think? Oh, Leon! Felix is with... thought he was your boyfriend? Felix said the sea is glowing tonight. Have you ever seen it? He told me about it. Devid says it's called bioluminescence. It's caused by the algae. I'm going to see it. Want to come? I'm tired. I have a tough day ahead. Come with me. I find the sea a bit spooky at night. It was a bit harsh, huh? -What was harsh? -The critique. My critique. wouldn't call it a critique. l have to sleep. -Funny car -It was the last one they had. Hi, Leon. Yes... It's nice here. How's the Uwe Johnson suite? Oh, yes... very nice. But I won't get to enjoy it much. -Why not? -I have to be in Berlin tomorrow. -I thought we had the whole weekend... -No. Something came up. Okay, let's get started. We don't have much time. Fantastic! Is this where you wrote? Just the final touches. I wrote most of it in Berlin. It's a great spot. Did you rent this place? No, my friend Felix's father bought it. He died about six years ago. And Felix is on holiday here while you... Not exactly. Actually, he's finishing his portfolio. -Portfolio? -Art school application. Shall we read it? Yes, let's get started. You don't have to read, Leon. Just listen to me. I'll read and you just listen, okay? I thought I'd read it to you. Didn't we do that last time? Let's do it this way now. -Just listen. -Okay. Right, I'll start. Okay, listen... "Soph was holding the baby, who was sucking on her amber necklace 'He's teething', she said. The baby's dribble ran down her cleavage, long strands of saliva quivered in the breeze. I hadn't seen Soph in two years and had rarely thought about her. During the last few months, when it became clear I'd be returning to Berlin, I'd thought of her more often. Now I wanted to hug her and we contorted our bodies so as not to crush the baby who wasn't at all bothered and continued to dribble and coo like a Berlin pigeon. I'l just go and change him', she said. I sat waiting in the kitchen. I tried to remember: Had she mentioned she was pregnant in one of the e-mails? Had I overlooked it? I must have done. I'd pictured how I'd pick her up, and we'd go over to the 'Grill' and then on to a club. While dozing on the plane, most of my dreams were of Soph: Me holding Soph in my arms by the River Spree, the sun just coming up, the smell of cigarettes and dancing and the sweat of the night glistening in her cleavage. Are there even smells in dreams? Or only images and sounds? Right now, in a fitted kitchen in a hideous Berlin townhouse, it smelled of a child's shit. She must have mentioned a child, I thought. Who was she living with..." Sorry, I have to take this. It's very important. Sure. Yes, Werner here. Yes, you said that. Yes. Shall I come straight to the surgery? Okay. -Shit. -Thank you. Yes. -Hello. -Helmut Werner. Hello. Nadja. Nice to meet you. -I'm the publisher. -Leon said you were coming. -Lovely. Did you get here okay? -Yes, sure -It's pretty here. -Was the motorway open? I mean, the fires... I'm making goulash later, so if you're not busy you're welcome to join us. -If you don't like the idea, then not. -No, I'd love to. -Great. -Thank you. Well, have fun. I mean, good luck. -I'm sorry. -It's fine. It was really important. She's very nice, Nadja. -Yes. Did you have a chat? -She's worried. -Why is she worried? -Because of the forest fires. They say the winds mainly blow inland from the sea here. So we're not at risk. -We've been invited to dinner -Excuse me? -Nadja's cooking. -I thought we'd go into town? I did a little research. There's a really good fish restaurant. It's much nicer here. Come on, let's get back to work. Yes. Okay, wait a moment... -I stopped at... "plane". -Yes. "Soph, dreams"... Ah, "plane". I'll go back a bit, because there's a part where I don't really understand why... Just listen, alright? "Are there even smells in dreams? Or only images and sounds? Right now, in a fitted kitchen in a hideous Berlin townhouse, it smelled of a child's shit. She must have mentioned a child. Who was she living with here? I could hear her singing, probably trying to get the boy to sleep. Or was it even a boy? He was wearing a blue onesie. So it probably was a boy." Have you decided how to arrange them? First the portraits, then the rear view? How do you want to do it? What do you think? The portraits first? -Yes. Definitely. That's nice. Very nice. -Can I suggest another thing? -Yes. A third level. The sea. Just the sea. Yes. Completely calm, completely empty. Devid suggested that too. -Is he your professor? -No, my boyfriend. If I may say so, these are quite crude black and white copies... There's no colour printer here. -The laser cartridges... -No, it's good like this. It makes it all fit together, it's kind of... How can I put it? It's all one level. It's very... It'll be a very nice portfolio. -Thanks. Do you have to write texts for it, like for an exhibition catalogue? -Yes, unfortunately. -"Unfortunately"? mean, texts and writing in general... It's not really my thing. If you get stuck, just call us when you get back to Berlin. We'll figure something out. -Dinner's ready! Leon, can you help me bring it out? The two of us will manage. You carry on, Are you coming? You're doing this on purpose! That's my publisher out there. He came to work. What the hell! Now he's looking at fucking photos and I'm the waiter! -Sorry, but you still have a few days. -No, we don't. He's leaving tomorrow. In the morning. Didn't go well? Devid? Huh? -What's this? What is this? -Huh? It's a tractor. An MTS 50. I brought some wine. Thank you. This is Helmut, -Leon's publisher. Devid. -Hi. -Where did you get it? -A friend of my parents. -We can tow the car with it. -Yes, true. -It'll pull anything -That's good. That's very good. Leon, can you chill the wine? And after dinner we'll tow the car. Devid! Do you even have a tow rope? -You must have one in your car. -No, I don't. -In the shed? -Yes. -But after dinner. -Yes, after dinner. Nadja, this is delicious. Thank you. But I didn't cook it It's left over from the hotel kitchen. They give away leftovers? -That's honourable. -Yes, to the staff. -Are you in the restaurant trade? -I'm a seasonal worker. She didn't get her scholarship. What kind of scholarship? Hans Bockler? Yes, I've heard it's difficult at the moment. What was the scholarship for? -She's writing her PhD -Oh? Which faculty? Literary studies in Marburg. Really? And... What is the subject of your thesis? Excuse me. I'm behaving like... I don't mean to interrogate you I'm really interested. I'm writing about Heinrich Heine's "Romanzero". Oh. And what exactly is your subject? I'm genuinely interested. I love Heine. The quake of love in Heine's "Romanzero". It's about representation. The quake of representation. Do you know the text by Werner Hamacher about the quake of representation in Kleist's "The Earthquake in Chile"? -Yes, that's kind of the reference. -Really? What's your favourite poem? One that you... particularly like? "The Asra". "The Asra"? Ah, yes... One day... No... Every day at eventide The sultan's daughter fair -Wandered... -... by the fountain. ... by the fountain... -Where the white... -Where the white water purls. -Every day... -... at eventide The young slave stood by the fountain Where the white water purls And every day his face grew paler. Then one evening the princess Approached him and suddenly spoke: 'Your name I wish to know, Your homeland and your tribe.' Said the slave, 'My name Is Mohamet, I come from Yemen And my tribe is the Asra, Who perish when they love.' That's beautiful. Again. -Yes! Again. -Really? Yes, please. Every day at eventide The sultan's daughter fair Wandered by the fountain Where the white water purls Every day at eventide The young slave stood by the fountain Where the white water purls And every day his face grew paler Then one evening the princess Approached him and suddenly spoke: 'Your name I wish to know, Your homeland and your tribe.' Said the slave, 'My name Is Mohamet, I come from Yemen And my tribe is the Asra, Who perish when they love.' We're getting the car. -We're going to get the car. -Need any help? No, we'll manage. How long will it take? An hour, maybe an hour and a half. -Okay, let's go. -Where's the rope? In the shed. Shall we have a drink? -Yes, I'd love to. -After goulash... White wine? Are you coming? Will you bring a glass? Shit, that's ash. This is ash! Ash! Come on, let's go. Come on! Take the rope. Nadja. So you're an ice-cream seller? What? You're a literary scholar. Why didn't you say? Because you never asked me. I showed you my manuscript. It would've been... Helmut! What's wrong? Can't you breathe? Leon, we need an ambulance! -Okay. -Can you get up? -What are you doing? Leon! -I can't get through! Give me a hand Let's go to the car. We'll get you to hospital Can you get up? That's good. Careful... -Are you comfy? -I don't have a license. -Who cares? Just drive! -No. I can't. -I can't do it! -Leon! -Know where the hospital is? -No. Turn left at the hotel. then follow the signs. Let's go. Nadja? ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY Mr Werner is now on Ward 4. Up the stairs, then left. Come on. -I saw wild boars on fire. -In a dream? In the woods. A boar piglet. It died right in front of me. Oh, sorry. I'll be right back, okay? What's wrong? I have to drink and run for a few days until it comes out. Kidney stones. I hear the coffee's better here. I don't know if it's true. I'd like to invite you for a cup, or a mug, but I have to go to Berlin. I'm afraid I won't be able to come and visit you again. Well... thank you. For the lovely evening and dinner. Enjoy the time you have left here, and say hi to Devid and Felix, okay? I'l go... back to my doctor. You two should get some sleep. You look tired. Anyway, take care of yourselves. Okay? Sorry. -Nadja? Do you have the car key? -Oh, yes. There's no coffee machine here, is there? -Is it bad? -Yes. It is. -What about Leon? -He's in a terrible state. Leon? Leon, listen. You will... ... write a wonderful book. Okay? Let's sit down a moment. But this one, "Club Sandwich"... is not the one. Put it aside. Completely. Write something new. And it will be right. I know it will. I'll support you as long as I can. I'm looking forward to it Then Katharina Kunkel will take over. I introduced you two in Frankfurt. She's a very good editor. You two think I'm an idiot, don't you? -I saw you. -Leon... I saw you two... What did you say? He asked if you'd read my book, right? What did you tell him? Of course he asked, I know him. -Fuck! -Leon, please stop this. "Leon, please stop.." You stop it! "Leon, please stop..." You stop it! Will you do Heine together? The "quake of love", of course! He'd like that! And Leon can conjure up some old crap with the fucking intern! This is even dumber than your book. Are you even aware of anything? Do you see anything happening around you? Did you really listen to Helmut? Do you even know what Ward 4 is? You see nothing! -What do you mean? -lt's not always about you! -What ward? -Oncology, you arsehole! Nadja? We should get out of here. The fire's getting close. Forgive me, please. But I... have to tell you that from the very first moment... I was in love with you. I think of you day and night. And by the sea just now... -Ms Schubert? -Yes. We have some sad news... We found two dead bodies. Devid Micoud and Felix Wagner. "The fire must have overcome them like a steamroller. The first young man probably jumped off the tractor, to the back, to warn the other young man. All around them were flames. If they'd taken the other forest track they would have stood a chance. Behind it is the Sengeswiese, an open field. But they turned onto the old postal road. It was a dead end. By the time they realized, it was too late. The fire was already around them. The policeman was very sympathetic, not at all like the policemen who deliver terrible news in films. She insisted on being allowed to see them one last time, even though the policeman and the pathology worker advised against it. They stood before a table that was wider than the others in the room, and he noticed they had pushed two of the autopsy tables together. The policeman took a step back when the pathologist pulled back the sheet. There they lay. Wrapped in each other's arms. The pathologist later explained that they hadn't suffocated, which meant they had been burned alive. He saw her next to him, looking down at the two bodies that couldn't be separated because they were so intertwined. And then he saw she was crying. And he looked down and felt her looking at him. And he wanted to cry. But instead of crying, he thought of the image of the lovers in Pompeii. He shook his head, as if trying to banish these images and thoughts and to truly grieve, here and now Here, with her. And then he looked at her, and her tear-filled eyes met his. She looked at him for a long time. Then she left. He had to stay. His friend's mother had to be informed. He followed the policeman to the station. It all took a while, perhaps a couple of hours. When he returned to the house that afternoon, she was gone. Her room was empty. He walked through the silent house, hoping she had left something behind. It was getting dark outside. He walked across the dunes down to the sea. He sat down in the sand. He waited. The scary thing is that they're all right, that some day he'll be able to forget it all. The house, the sea... and her. In very rare moments, when loneliness torments him and he feels sad, a vague memory will assail him. And it may seem as if someone remembers him, is waiting for him, that they will meet again. 'Where are you? ' When he looked up, it was night. The sea was glowing." spoke to Felix's mother. She was pleased you're dedicating the book to him. Well, "pleased" is maybe... the wrong word. She was very touched. -You read the whole book to her. -Yes, she wanted me to. -Did she call you? -No, I called her. Why? I changed the names, so legally... -And the locations. It should be... -Not because of that. wanted her consent for this. -As a cover? -God no, not a cover image. I thought maybe for the ending "When he looked up, it was night. The sea was glowing." Is that Nadja? Do you think so? It's the only photo with no accompanying portrait. You'll have to leave me alone for 20 minutes. -Can I help you? -No, someone's coming to do it... professionally. Always the same sentence: "Alright, Mr Werner, so, how about it? " Do you have anything to read? No. This here is by some young Icelander I'm a bit unsure. Can you read it? I'd be interested in your opinion. Yes? -Mr Werner? -Yes, come in. So, how about it?
