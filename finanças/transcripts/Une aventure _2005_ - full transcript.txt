Julien and I were the same age. We had always known each other. We trusted each other. It was natural to live together. I was the one who found the apartment. He didn't mind the area. Please, come in. The owner is quite fussy about this listing. There's a lot of demand. What do you mean? Are you married? No. That isn't very trustworthy. Why that? If you have children, you'll look for a bigger place and we will have to start over. Anyway, we need your last three payslips, a bank or parent guarantee and your latest rent certificate. That's it. Please, don't smoke. Thank you. Hello? Yes, I am with a client. You read the file, no? - I don't like this type of guy. - I'll call you back at 4 p.m. You find it expensive? A little bit, no? But with two people, it will be fine. Remember: no children. Yeah, right. We didn't have the same schedule. But we were fine with that. I know he was accurate and thorough with his work. You look for something, push a button, and get an answer straightaway. ACCESS TO THE IMAGES GRANTED UNTIL 00:00 HAVE A GOOD TIME He saw her for the first time two months after we arrived. In the early winter. You forgot your key. I was sleeping. Excuse me, I pressed the wrong button and it stopped working… You should ask my colleague, I'm quite busy. - Thank you. - Thank you. Serve us some wine, Julien. We came to see you at the video library, but got the wrong time. It is a quite dark place, no? How does it feel for you? Isn't it a bit suffocating? No, I like it. Will you keep working there? Well, yeah. Really? I thought it was temporary. No, I like it. I guess I have no ambition. Not bad. Bon appétit. Martin! I already got the Parmesan. Could you get some gnocchi? Give me that. Give it to me. Wait for me. Thirty-two euros, please. Yes. Ten euros and ninety-five cents. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Are you hurt? What can I do? - Can I help you? - You hurt me! Do you need help? Can you hear me? Should I call someone? Gabrielle's answering machine. Leave a message, thank you. Is it rolling? Djem? Happy birthday to you Stop, just enjoy the moment. Gabrielle? I am late. The subway was two hours late. I went to the dry-cleaner's. You broke something? No. Leave it. He came by? You had a fight? We don't fight. Thank you. Assan, could I get some cigarettes? Are you OK? - You live in the area, right? - Yeah. - Been there long? - No. - Are you alone? - Yeah. Want a drink? Come. Hello. - Djemila. - Julien. It's a no-no to accost people you don't know, right? - Excuse her. - No, it's fine. Want to drink something? No, thank you. A beer. Could we have two beers? Honey… She is over there. Go, darling. She is over there. You don't work? Yes, I do. What are you doing here? I work at night. You don't look like a guy who works at night. In a club? A video library. What is that? A place where you can watch movies, video documents, images… That kind of thing. I'm in the technical department. Thank you, Assan. Thank you. I feel like I already saw you somewhere but I can't… He lives in the area. No, leave it. What's your job? I am a housekeeper. I take care of the child and the apartment. She isn't too much of a pain. She gets me gifts. And I don't work. I am idle, as they say. She is too spoiled. Take it. Yes? No, she went shopping. Yeah. What do I tell her? OK. Bye, Louis. He'll pick you up at ten p.m. - You live with someone? - Yes. I don't know if we can quite call it that. Do you never shut up? I'll go and pay. What are you doing here? Are you following me? I remember where I saw you, now. You really don't remember? I didn't come here to scare you. I don't care anyway. Hi, Gabrielle. What is it? Why are you doing all this? How is your arm? It's fine. Were you there when I got that? What did you see? Tell me. This is Julien. He lives across the street. Really? Good evening. Good evening. Mina said you stole her phone. I didn't steal anything. Well, you tell her, then. Did you know the place? - No, I just discovered it. - How do you find it? We reopened two months ago, so it isn't done. But it is working nicely. Thank you. You like it? Are you the manager? No way, no thanks. I have a share. We are a few. They let you in like that? Why not. They surely slipped up. Surely, yeah. Want to come with us? It is instinctive, like an animal. It can be a man or a woman. It is an encounter. For me, it was a man. I was 18, I worked in Enghien. - The casino? - Mmm hmm. Yes, I was at the tables. I was a waiter. You must have looked cute. I looked quite good. Anyway, when I saw him, I knew. He looked irreproachable, a fine cravat, a small cigar. Classy. And he was funny. He ordered champagne, I brought it to him. And he gave me a tip of five hundred francs. Can you imagine? Five hundred? One week later, he hired me as his chauffeur, henchman, handyman. - He never touched me. - Right. No, but if he did, I would have slept with him. Today, I can say it. I don't care. Ashtrays, please. Do you still see him? No, he passed. We ate well, no? It was like world cuisine: fish, melon, pistachio. There's a problem at a table. - Do we know them? - No we don't. But that's not my job, buddy. - I'm coming. - Very well. I'll be back. What about you? What is it this time? I followed you. I even got inside your apartment. You went back to bed. You were calm. I stayed for a moment and I left. Did I talk? Very little. A few words. Get out of here, now! Enough! Get lost! I used to talk when I was a child. My mother told me about it the next day. But it hadn't happened to me in a long time. I don't want to relive this. Not this. All good? All good, they just didn't like their table. One was drunk and wanted to do all the girls. Shall we go? What's your name again? Julien? Shall we, Julien? - Coffee? - No, I'm good. - Where are you going? - The West Indies. - How long? - Depends on how much we like it. - Coming with us? - No, I'll go home. You're sure? We will surely meet again. Goodbye. Martin is sleeping nicely. Right, I have to pay Djemila. Are you OK? ENTER KEYWORDS TO FIND A MOVIE "SLEEPWALKING" VIDEO AVAILABLE IN ONE MINUTE THE MYSTERIES OF SLEEP We often tend to confuse hypnosis and sleepwalking. But hypnosis is a prompted phenomenon, planned, "staged," in a way. But how is it really like for the patient? It is hard to say how it really is like for them. But let's say it is characterized by a wandering activity. This activity is more or less long and broad. It can simply be gestures. Sometimes violent, suicidal or aggressive… They are totally unaware. They are here without being here, in a way. It is an absent presence. And the patients don't remember anything when they wake up. A vague feeling that lasts for a while, at most. Mostly, concern and fear. What do people know about them that they ignore? Can we call it an illness? In any case, it is a symptom, the sign of a psychological and emotional disorder. And these people put themselves at risk during the episode. They can hurt themselves, jump out the window… So they are very vulnerable, they become awfully dependent on others, their attention and looks. She was gone for three weeks. I don't think he waited for her. That he lay in wait for her return. I don't think so. There he is. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? He wonders why I'm here. A little bit, yeah. Don't worry, I just arrived. I was telling Cécile I want to invite you home for dinner. With Louis. All four of us. I thought it'd be nice. Ok, well… Only if you would like it. I won't force you. Well, why not? It is right across the street. 5th floor. With the blinds. And how did you meet each other? He didn't tell you? Well, no. You were in Turin. - He is discreet. - Right. He didn't say there was… a kind of crazy girl roaming in the area? - No, he didn't. - I will explain. But it's fine, don't worry. It isn't dangerous? No, not at all. Thank you, in any case. You're welcome. But it is fine, now. I feel a lot better. That's good. But when you see Louis, don't tell him. I prefer it that way. Here, darling. Who is Louis? Well, the man I live with. Ah, OK. Right. We were on vacation in the West Indies. Been there? - No. - No. It is nice, but well… The beach, the hotel. There isn't much to do or many people to see. But it is very comfortable. They serve punch, it makes you a bit tipsy. And we got some rest. I slept a lot. Could I get a glass of water? Of course. Leave it to me. Would you prefer orange juice? - No, water is fine. - OK. So are you back at work? No, I don't work. I am lucky. Thank you. You're welcome. After Gabrielle left… How about Tuesday? …he told me his version of their encounter. Goodbye. He said she came out at night without knowing it. That he helped her. - Say goodbye, Martin. - Bye. That he walked a bit with her. He lied, a bit. Are you ready? - Yes, I'm coming. - I'll wait for you. Good night. What's the time? - We are on time. - OK. - Are you nervous? - No. Yes, you are. Is it because of me? Did she ask you to wear that? She must think it looks chic. If it pleases her… You know them? I only met him in the area, but never saw his girlfriend. It's good that she sees people. - I told you to put it in real platters. - It's all the same. It's ugly. Should we eat this warm or cold? - As it is now. - Lukewarm, then. The food comes from a caterer. We noticed. Thanks. Well, we never ask people round. This is a first. How long have you lived here? Since March. So you just arrived. And you? How long ago did we get this apartment, my love? - Three years? - Four. Already? What are you doing here? Why aren't you sleeping? - Why? - I am scared of wolves. What? But there are no wolves, here. They are sleeping. Come on, go to bed. Clear the table. Come. Come, darling. I am not done. - Any children? - No. We are thinking about it. You don't want any. Am I being indiscreet? A bit, yes. You're right. - Take it out. - It isn't warm. - Yes, it is. - It isn't warm enough! Give me that, if we leave it inside, it's going to burn. You think you know, but you don't... Sort this out! It's OK. So you looked for partners. Did you check with banks? Yes… but they rejected me. They want guarantees and I have no money. It's always the same problem. But I haven't given up. I owned a store. What kind of store? I owned it for six months. What was it called again? - "Tendance," darling. - "Tendance." I sold pillow cases, small lamps, picture frames, candles… It was pathetic and a total failure. It would have worked in a mall. No. It was my fault, I didn't know how to manage or sell. What do you work with, Louis? How could I explain it? Money. I try things out. It works, doesn't work. It isn't a shameful profession. Right, Julien? No idea. I buy shares from a restaurant, a store. Sometimes real estate, a furniture clearance sale. And other things. It is like a game. Money comes and goes, doesn't belong to anyone. Are we going to talk about money all night? Do you find it interesting? I was just answering a question. What do you want to explain? How to earn money? They are not your usual idiots. I know very well. You already got it. Playing tea parties, all that. It's just hot air. You're getting angry for nothing. Don't use that tone. Don't ever do that again. We should go. No. It's OK. Sorry. Does anyone want dessert? I'm good. I would like some coffee. - Champagne? - No, thanks. - You sure? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Champagne? - No, thank you. - No, I don't usually dance… - Come on! You know, that's not my son. I love him, but he isn't my son. I don't know where or who his father is. She had a weird life. Violent. So of course, it left marks. When I found her… she could have died from it. We always think we save people… He is leaving. You should sleep here more often. What's wrong? You used to tell me. I can't sleep. I feel dirty. We can't have it all. What's wrong? I don't want to talk to you. It's all your fault. What is he doing here? - Get lost! - Louis! Tell him to get out! What? You like that? Stop, get out, now. Leave us alone. I'm stealing your girl, Louis. Is that OK? Thanks. We never see each other alone. So we can do that? I didn't know. Don't misunderstand me. What you saw, me at night, it creates a special bond. At least, that's how it is for me. You can't smoke here. What is your job, exactly? It is too boring, it won't... Tell me. I've never been in a video library. In a library either. Is it a private company or is the State paying you? Well, I'm a civil servant. That's the word. They work in the town hall, post office... I know what a civil servant is. Who is your son with, tonight? With my mother. I had a fight with Djemila. She isn't mean, but she talks too much. I don't trust her anymore. We drank a lot yesterday. But it was nice, no? I liked it. What did you think? It was nice. I feel like you don't see a lot of people. I don't. I don't have friends. Well, Louis has friends. But they come and go. I don't really care. What did he tell you last night? He told me how you met. How he saved me and got me out of there? It's all true. You still haven't told him. What? About what I saw. No. Why? It's none of his business. He'd have to be there for that. He'd have to sleep at home. When he leaves, I don't know what he does, where he goes. He never tells me anything. If one day, he is found dead in a parking lot… They wouldn't even tell me. I'd like you to follow him. We don't know each other well, but I trust you. I'd understand if you said no. Good evening. Is Gabrielle here? No, she's still out. Martin! Come in. And I take care of the kid. The girl that took care of him didn't do her job. Have you known Gabrielle for long? No, I live across the street. She told me she didn't know anyone in the area. I live in Vanves. I will need a car. I'm home! Hi, sweetie. Hello. How are you? Been here long? No. You didn't call me. I found what you were looking for. Here, this should be your size. You can return it. Come. I will take him to bed, mom. Do you want to know? Go ahead. He has a house. A beautiful one. I think he has a family. I saw two kids and a woman. She is Dutch. Dark hair. Her name is Marina. She sold him the house. They have two children together. So why did you ask me to follow him? You think I didn't know that I have a shitty life? I don't care about the apartment and all. It isn't what I wanted. Then go, leave him. You are free! Did he see you? What am I doing here with you? Put that shit away! All good? Graziella, Olivier's friend. She worked with him in Milan. Hello. I'll be back. I'll tell you everything. I won't see her again. Thank you. Why do I never know if you'll stay the night? I don't know either. How convenient. Don't talk nonsense. Come on. Come. Do you think I'm pretty? Why? Is that what matters? I don't know. The first person she called was Julien. And of course, he went. We gave her something to make her sleep. What happened? An accident. She got hit by a car, but nothing serious. - I'll come back. - Very well. I acted like an idiot. Yeah. My hip is all blue. It could have been worse. They wanted me to go to a psychiatric unit. You need care. There's nothing they can do. What are you scared of? I got your text. I didn't know you were leaving today. It was a last minute thing. How long will it be? I don't know, two weeks. It depends on the work. Your flight is two hours late. Two hours? Isn't there any other flight? That is the only one, sorry. I have to call them. Go, you can't wait here! I have work at eight p.m. It's fine. Just go, this is stupid! There are things I want to say. Don't. Not here, not now. We don't have time. You're such a drag. - We have two hours. - And is that enough? I know what you will say and I won't believe it. This girl, going out at night, disappearing… It can be attractive. But she has a life and a man. You saw him, it's a different world. And you don't measure up. I've had enough, I'm going. Or I won't be able to go, to work. You get that? So I should have kept quiet? You put yourself in my place. That's good. I feel lost. You'll grow out of it. You think? But you didn't sleep with her? Right? Of course. There. It is when she opened her eyes that the episode began. - And she's still asleep? - Yes. The infrared light is giving her these strange eyes. Why is she staring at the cameras? She's sleeping, but she knows she's being watched. That's why she won't move much. You will see. When they know they're filmed, we get very little wandering. It's hard to get the pictures of a real episode. She'll stay like this for a while… and go back to bed. There we go. It barely lasted two minutes. But what we observed here was just a tiny fit. We need a longer observation. Then, we'll be able to start a treatment. Which one? Anxiolytics. We had very encouraging results with that. You think she'll get better? This isn't like a cold. It depends on her own will, emotional elements, her depression. She will need you. I don't know how people manage to live together. I guess I'll have to imagine. There are things about my life that you ignore. Maybe you don't care? You can start your life over. - When do the visits close? - Seven p.m. You come every day. You go shopping first, you bring fruits, flowers, chocolate. That's good of you. You make yourself useful. - They'd tell you to get... - Bye, Louis. I'm talking to you! Answer when I talk to you! Careful, you'll fall. Now, leave us alone and piss off. Is that clear. Slowly, slowly. Enough. Calm down! Come on! Calm down, now! I noticed she wasn't doing well. I thought it was fine, it would pass. She wouldn't have told me, anyway. I want to do what you didn't. You didn't help her when she needed it. What did you do except give her money? So money is nothing? Keep thinking that. And don't see it that way. She isn't self-interested, she isn't a prostitute but she likes to buy nice things. It's going to close soon. Wait. I don't think she and I can end things like this. I wish, sometimes, but… It's not just about sex. Although in that regard, both of us never experienced anything like it. I shouldn't have said that? Sorry. But it exists, buddy. Don't make a big deal out of it. It's not a smart thing to say. You're a bit of a drag. No? You know she is going to destroy you. I can feel it. All good, darling? Why did you lend her your pencil case? She will give it back, it's OK. Yes, I will come back soon. Just not now. Soon, sweetie. But I will call you every day, OK? PLATFORM ENTRANCE VEHICLE RENTAL When was the last time you came here? Three, four years ago. This bedroom is big. It was my parents' room. You didn't tell me how you lost them. An accident. But not here. How did you manage? I finished my studies. Well, high school. I was already with Cécile, so her parents helped me. So Cécile is like a sister. A bit, yeah. I got this for you. Thank you. - Ever taken these? - No. Maybe I should? Your life has always been so straight. I must have wasted time. It is strange to see you here. You'll see, you'll get better. I was so lucky to meet you. Thank you. I used all the hot water. You're the one that's insane. Good night. Let's go. It is quite cold, anyway. You're not coming? No. Why? - I'm watching you. - Why? - So you don't want to come? - No, I'm fine. - You're sure? - Don't worry. OK, see you soon. You'll never leave me, right? Never. What are you doing? You want to go out? Stop! Stop! Calm down. Are you OK? Your mom came by, earlier. Since you were sleeping, she said she would come back. You need to eat. It is important. It is important to keep track of the fits. To try to understand what triggers them, what happens, and how to act about it. But you can't do that alone. Who do you talk to? About what really interests you? About what matters? I'll get him. - Nice house. - My wife takes care of that. I knew you had a family. Want a drink? A beer, if you have some. I could have called you. Marina, this is Julien. Stay, please. We talked about it. How is she? Better. Well, I hope so. She doesn't talk much. I don't think I should see her. I will, if I have to. But I think it would hurt her. And you heard what I had to say. Feeling better? Do you want me to leave? Come. I want you to see something. I'm sorry for you. It didn't even hurt. I should go. Focus. Yes? I'll get her. It's Julien. Yes? I'm fine. They did a few things. I think I'll have to live with it. Call me first, then. OK, see you tomorrow. I can call Louis, if you want. No. Martin. Come. Come here. Let's have a good night sleep. - No! - Yes. You don't want to go to bed? Yes, you do. Look how tired your Binky is. - He is so tired. - No. - I'll come to say goodnight. - Yeah. Come. Here, Thomas. We will continue tomorrow. - Is it Christmas tomorrow? - Let's go to bed. Let her in. I know it's over. Sit down. I won't stay long. You can drive me back? Gabrielle? Give her water. Gabrielle? I remember when we met. You looked like you were 15. You always wanted to have sex. All the time. No. No. Please, no. Julien came home late, that night. We came to live in this area by accident. We didn't stay here for long, in the end. Don't, I'm going to leave. I made my decision. Stop. I'll get the rest tomorrow with my parents. Please, stop. She's here. What? Gabrielle? Gabrielle? Julien said she wasn't conscious when she did it. That she committed the crime unwittingly, during a fit. One of those fits he so often witnessed. That's what he said. They believed him. Gabrielle was released. She left without telling anyone where she went.
