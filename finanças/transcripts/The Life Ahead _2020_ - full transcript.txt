NETFLIX PRESENTS I'll give you some water, darling. You're badly sunburnt. Are you tired? Come here. Come. Sit down. I'll give you some water. Of course, love. Let's see. Momo? What are you doing here? Momo? Hold on! Where are you going? Momo! Momo! Wait! Stop! Momo! Momo, open this door! Momo, open! Momo! Some people say that everything is written and nothing can be changed. Open up! But I wanna change it all… And go back to the beginning, when nothing was written. THE LIFE AHEAD SIX MONTHS EARLIER Can we go take a look over there? Yes, but don't wander off. Hey! Hey! Somebody, grab him! That little jerk! Many times in the weekend. - Oh, wow, how cool! - I'll call you back. - Is it new? - Hands off! - What do you want? - Where's Ruspa? - Why? - I got a deal for him. - Oh, a deal? Yeah, sure. - Yeah, a deal! Look it! These are worth a lot. They're antiquated. This is shit. Go back to your PlayStation. - Ruspa! Rusp... - Hey! I told you he's not here. Mind your own business! - Are you trying to piss me off? - I wanna see him. - When I say no, it's no! - But... Go, go. Go away, asshole. Don't come back. Go. No, my bike! Son of a bitch! I'ma fuck… God damn it! I'm 12 years old. My name is Mohamed, but people call me Momo. I'm an orphan. When I was little, Social Services sent me to live with Dr. Coen. He worked from home and there were patients everywhere. According to him, I should behave like other kids, so I wouldn't end up in trouble. But I don't wanna be like other kids. Momo, where were you? I looked everywhere for you. What are those? - I won them. - Ah! Then it must be your lucky day. You won this, too? I fell off my bike. I'll ask you one more time. Whose are they? Beats me. In my house, I don't allow stolen goods. If your memory doesn't come back… I'll be forced to turn you in. I could've paid a month's rent with those candlesticks. Get it? I worked those streets 40 years. I've never ever been cheated, huh? Never beaten up. My God! Then you get to my age… And you get screwed by a little brat. Fuck that! What's so funny to you, Babu? Huh? And now what do I sell to make rent? I know. You're hungry, huh? Want a biscuit? Here, amore mio. Here. Tiene. And who is bugging us now? Iosif, go open the door. Vai. All right. And remember, before opening, ask who it is. Never mind, leave it, I'm coming. Madame Rosa, it's Dr. Coen. - Dr. Coen? - Eh. It's Dr. Coen. - Rosa. - Ciao. I see you look worried, but don't be, it's a good thing. - Hmm. - I brought you a gift. - Where did you find these? - The thief has come to apologize. Right, Momo? I fell because of you. If only I could've gotten my hands on you… Here, here. Go to Babu. It's your turn. Sorry. I can't hear you! Sorry! "Sorry, Madame…" How would I know your damn name? Kids around here have always called me Madame Rosa. I'm sorry, Madame Rosa. Apology not accepted. Thank you for the candlesticks. How could I repay you? I do need a favor. Eh, yes, tell me. Are you nuts? Better off dead. - Just a short time, two or three weeks. - No, no. No, no, no, no. Uh, a month, at most. Not even up for discussion. Just until I find him a proper place to live. Let me get this straight. Why drag me into this? You're his guardian. I'm convinced that here, with you, he'd be better off. Oh, yeah? And why is that? What the boy needs is a strong female figure. Someone who's tough, who commands respect. Just like you. I can't do it anymore. I'm old. And what am I? A spring chicken, right? Huh? You're my doctor. You know about my heart troubles, my pains. Like I said, it's just temporary. - Until I... - No. Momo isn't who you think he is. I know him very well. He was placed in my care after the tragedy. I tried, but I couldn't find anyone to adopt him. The tragedy? Go to the other room. I'll be right there. His mother was a patient of mine. I was close to her. Fact is, Momo came here from Senegal when he was just three. No, no, no. I am through. I'm tired of having hookers' kids running around my house. I've looked after too many and risked a lot over all these years. But we working girls, we could always find some agreement. Better me than Social Services. That's what I'm asking you! Let's find an agreement. But you, you're not prostitute. Like I told you, I am through. - So, what about Iosif? - Never mind him. He was only supposed to stay here one week. It's been months, but we can't find his mother. At least, thank God, she sends me money regularly. - If it's a question of money... - No, no, just leave it. You are my dear friend. I'm grateful you found my candlesticks. Now I can pay the rent, but it's time. Go on, get out. Would €600 a month do it? I haven't completely run out of my savings. Go. Wait. Oh! You left your thief in my house! Seven hundred. Seven hundred and fifty. Two months, and not one day more. I'm not living with that old bag! Don't call her that! Rosa's a good person. If you like her so much, you go live with her. Momo, it's either her or it's Social Services. I don't give a shit! Social Services! Here I come! Here I come! Hey, smartass! If you'd talked to me that way, I would've punched your teeth in. I was in the café and overheard you. I wouldn't talk to you that way, especially if you give me work. Why don't you wanna live with the old bag? You'd get Social Services off your back. And this would be useful for business. Do you get what I mean? When the old lady quit streetwalking, she started looking after other hookers' kids to make some money. She raised lots of kids. One of them became chief of police, and he protected her from the inspectors. In the neighborhood, they called this place "the refuge." I called it… "The shithole." I promise you, he'll be all right. And he'll behave properly. He just needs some extra discipline and more affection. Okay, Doctor, I get it. Now go before I change my mind. Can you get off the bed, please? Get off my bed now! - Leave me alone. - Get off! Stop! Get up, you. Get up now! Never put your shoes on the bed! And, Iosif, instead of wasting your time, study your Hebrew. Quiz you later. You, with me. I set you up some place else. Here you go. What is this? Your bedroom. It's a hole! What did you expect, a palace? Give me a break. It's a hole. Shithead! Let go of me! Madame! Ahhh! Enough! Stop it! I said that's enough! Stop it! Iosif, to your room. And you, out of my sight. I'm too old for this shit. I don't even have a picture of my mother, but I do remember some things about her. Her smile when she'd stand me on her feet and we would dance together. She loved to dance. Once I accidentally I made her fall. But she didn't get upset. We rolled around on the rug, and she held me in her arms and laughed. She laughed so much. She was so beautiful. Start with these. Hash, weed. Light and dark. Each bag is a full dose. Don't get caught. But above all, don't ever screw me. Follow my rules and we won't have any accidents. Let's go. Hey! You gonna give it away for free? The prices? Synthetic and natural weed, €10. Hash, €60. Cash only, no restaurant vouchers. Right? Little smartass. Get to it. "Hashem. Hashem." - I did say "Hashem." - Oh, no, no, you said "pashem." I'm done. I'm sick of learning this stuff. I don't even understand it. - I don't want a bar mitzvah anyway. - Suit yourself. But as long as you're here, I'll be making the rules. Continue. Amore, it's me. - Hey, ciao. - Look what I have. Eyeliner, eye shadow, lipstick. - Almost all new. - Che bello! - I cleaned out my cabinet. - Beautiful. I love it. There are also samples, creams and perfumes. Fantastic! - My drawers were packed. Mmm-hmm. - Ah! Go on. Go get Babu. Who's that? Ciao, I'm Lola. Momo. Momo? Hmm. Adorable. Huh? Ah, sure he is. Want to make a trade? I'll keep Babu and then you take that thing. Mommy! My baby! Hello, my love! Come to Mommy! Yay! Did you sleep well? Mmm-hmm? Qué bien! We're gonna have so much fun today, okay? - Yay! - How do you do it? Acrobatics all night and mom all day. I have to prove to that bitch… Of his mother that we can get by just fine without her. No. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Not today. - Come on, amore. Let's dance! Come on. Exercise is good for the heart, amore. Not today, I'm not in the mood. It's no use you do this. I can't, I'm not... Come on. Let's go. Yeah! - And she's off. - Sure, I'm off… Look! Good! Oh, yeah! Break out! I like that. No, no, no, no, no, no! Give me that. That's not a toy, it's for work, okay? Please! No! Whoo! Ha! Take this. Why isn't Iosif helping us out? Because he dried dishes yesterday. Now it's your turn. Here. What are you doing? Careful! All right. It's too hot. Go, go, go. Go play with the others. Hey, pass it! Yo, what's that number she's got on her arm? - Who? - The old bag. It's a code. A code for what? You know, it's a cover. She pretends to have a bad back, all these aches and pains, but she's really a secret agent. Counterespionage. I think her headquarters are in the building, and she uses that code to get in. Better not be messing with me. I swear! I've seen her go there at night. Down in the basement. It's kinda like the Batcave. - Where are you going? - Screw off. See you. Thanks, bro. Madame Rosa, I found him. You snitch, I'll slit your throat. Where were you? Come, let's go. - Where are you taking me? - Move along. Hamil, you know it gets harder and harder to raise kids in this neighborhood. Of course. But I couldn't bring myself to say no to a friend like Dr. Coen. - Please have some. Fresh from Algeria. - No, no. No, thank you. Momo! Momo! Come here. You want one? - They make me gag. - No. Hmm. I was thinking the boy could give you a hand once in a while. You know, just to keep him occupied during the summer. Business isn't exactly going so well. All I'm asking is that you have him over to help two or three times a week, not every day. And only if you get along. - Certainly. - Mmm. Where are you from? He's Senegalese Muslim, Hamil. Do you go to the mosque? See how he is? He's in need of some guidance. I know it would be good for Momo to spend a little time with you. - Mmm. - Signor Hamil, you are without a doubt the most honorable man I've ever met. - Madame Rosa… - Mmm. …your eyes and voice are singing the song of deceit. - No! What deceit? - Mmm. Plus, if the boy works out, maybe you can give some tiny compensation. And how much, would you suggest? Good heavens, you decide! It's not up to me. Why don't you come see me on Monday, yes? Nala! Starting now, the south side neighborhood is his. What the hell? He made more in a week than you have in a whole month. I've busted my ass for years, now this fucking kid... Hey! Watch it! When you make as much as this kid did this week, I'll reconsider my decision. Now give me the phone and get lost. It's not for games. It's for work. All of our clients' numbers are in this phone. I'm counting on you. Yes, sir. Piece of shit! Momo, come here! Why are you yelling? Hurry! Come on! Hurry up! What's going on? Look! Look. What's up with her? I Don't know. I found her like this. Like a mummy. Hey. You there? What are you doing? Do it with me. Are you crazy? What are you doing? Can't you see that it's pouring? You're the one who doesn't see it. Of course I see it, you dummy. Inside, right now! You're late. Grab that box of lighters and move them there. Which part of Senegal are you from, Mohamed? Don't call me Mohamed. My name's Momo. What's wrong with Mohamed? It's a lovely name. I don't like it. It's long. All right. I'm from Diourbel. Close to Dakar. Is it a big city? Don't know. We left there when I was just a little baby. Hey, come here. Come. When I started, I sold rugs and antique books. I even had two employees. Now all I sell is plastic. Come here. Help me out. Grab this. Beautiful, right? Beautiful and full of history. I've been wanting to fix it but never had time. But you can help me now, yeah? Come here. In the Qur'ān, the lion is a symbol of power, patience and faith. You have faith, right? Faith is like love. Every Muslim must remember this. I didn't even know that I was Muslim. When I used to go to school, I found out. Why don't you go anymore? - I got kicked out. - Why? A guy was bullying me, so I stuck a pencil in his neck. Momo… Use your words. Language is the greatest weapon. There's no need to stick a pencil in someone's throat. I do it my way. Momo, what are you doing? You woke us up with all your noises. You even scared Babu. Babu, it was just a lioness. What lioness? Are you on drugs? - What the hell are you saying? - Madame, I swear, he's high. Don't you dare lay a finger. Not one finger. So, it's your lioness. The one I already know about, right? Hmm? Yeah. But now she only comes to visit you? Mmm-hmm. And you're not telling people that she's coming to maul them? No, I'm not that dumb. And you two play together. Mmm-hmm. She licks my face. - She looks at me. - Are you kidding? He's not right in the head. Momo, can you step outside one moment, please? I come here and tell you about all the trouble he's causing me, and what do you do, huh? You enable him? This is complete madness, huh? Calm down and listen. No, you listen to me. You keep telling me that with my bad heart, I need to stay calm and relaxed. And then you ask me to put that hooligan in my house? Huh? - Rosa, he's just a boy. - What boy? The kid's not normal. He's bad news, I tell you. It's not his fault. He got it from someone. Maybe his mom, his dad, I don't know. The point is, one night, he'll slit our throats. Either me or one of my boys. I know what he's capable of. Better watch out. Stop it! Enough of that. How can you allow yourself to say or even think such things, after everything you've been through? What I'm saying is that boy has a different way of thinking. You know I don't judge anyone. You're doing me a huge favor. I know it's a burden on you. But be reasonable, Rosa… You're an intelligent woman. And what are you afraid of? A lioness? It's just his need for protection, and affection, and love. So, what should I do? Lick his face every single night before I put him to bed? Huh? Just what I needed, a lioness. Grazie. Thank you. You can't stay here, you understand? We're gonna have to relocate you. Come on, come on. Let's go. That's right, you two. You, too. No! No! No! - Let's go. Come on. - I want to see. No, there's nothing to see here. We'll go around. No. Go. Go in the house. I'm coming. What are you doing here? Huh? What do you want? What is this place? Get out! Out now! Go home! Go away! No. I don't want anyone to come in here. Not anyone! You know, when I was your age, I liked drawing, too. May I see? Being down in that room… It makes me feel safe. And why? I just do. If you like, you can stay here as long as you want. You can sleep in Iosif's room, that way you'll have more space. If it makes you happy. Shut up! I wanna sleep. Can't you just shut up? You'll wake up Babu. Hey. - What's up? - Nothing. - Tell me before I beat you up. - I miss my mother. Just forget it. I want her. She's not coming back. She abandoned you. That's not true. She'll be back. Why are you such an asshole? Don't tell me you never miss your mommy. My mother didn't abandon me. She died. She wanted to quit being a hooker and Dad lost it on her. I was six years old. With her, I had the best years of my life. So you see? We're both the same. You miss your mom, too. No, we're not the same. Not at all. Now go to sleep, or I'll beat your ass up. Here. Try it, chickenshit. I'm no chickenshit. I just like my fish cooked. When it's cooked, it loses its flavor. Be a man! Mmm! It's good, right? Here. For the first two months. Go enjoy yourself. Thank you. Come on over here. - Like it? - Mmm-hmm. It's yours. I'm young, and I've got a lot of life left to live. I know that. But I won't kiss up to happiness. If it comes, great. If it doesn't, I don't care. Happiness and me, we're not of the same race. Be careful running, kids. Yeah. Catch me. Come catch me! What is that? What are you smoking? - Strawberry flavor. - Strawberry? - You don't like it? - Blow it that way. It's disgusting. Strawberry? Smoke should smell like tobacco, not a fruit salad. I'll never be able to quit smoking. That's because you don't have discipline. Never have. Never. Where are you going? Bathroom. Lola lived downstairs from us. As a man, she'd been a middleweight boxing champion. People respected her in the neighborhood, because if someone pissed her off, she'd smash their faces in. What's wrong? My father, he remembered my birthday. - That's not good? - No. It's just an excuse, I know. He wants to meet Babu. The grandson, yes. The daughter, no. Like hell we're going to Galicia. Like hell! What is she up to? I'll go check on her. You and me against Momo. I'm going to catch you. Got you. Come on, you can't do it. You're not that fast. I'll catch you! - All right! - Better run! Momo, I didn't find her. Come with me. Go that way, I look here. Amore! Amore! Where is she? Amore? Madame Rosa? Amore! Madame Rosa! Madame Rosa! Madame Rosa, can you hear me? Wait, what brings you here? Look what I found. - Ah, the shoes, yes. Give me those - Amore? - Amore? - Eh? Where did you go? You just disappeared. I… Eh? It was hot. She wanted to get some air. Right? That's right. That's right. Yes, it's true. It's true. Please, next time, let me know. - You really scared us. - Eh. Excuse me. Come on, let's go. It's late. Hmm. Wow, you're very good at that. I'm always good at doing the things I don't like. Then you'll do well in school. Except for that. Were you ever married, Mr. Hamil? Of course. I had a very beautiful wife. Where is she? The almighty has taken her back. May she rest in peace. Don't you feel lonely? Well, I have my rugs, my books. What are you gonna do with those? Hug them? And what's your point? You're old and single. Madame Rosa is old and single, you know… Are you trying to be a matchmaker and set us up? Sure, why not? If you guys hang out and hug a while, you'd get her off my back. How generous of you. The problem is that I could never marry a Jew. Madame Rosa is not Jewish anymore. She's just old. Yeah, son. But even old folks are much too selfish to live well together. Fine, at least I tried. Well, I appreciate the effort. "Shalom. Bye. Sen." - "Ken," not "sen." - "Ken." - "Toda. Lo." - Yes. - "Bevakama." - "Bevakasha." - "Bevakasha." - Good job. - And "slikha." - "Slikha." Madame Rosa? The hell is she doing? Madame Rosa? Stairs! They're on the stairs! Who is? - Madame Rosa, open up! - Go away. - Let me in. - Grab the suitcase. Go down and get Lola! Hurry up! Madame! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Momo, what's going on? She's won't answer. Won't open. Wait a minute. Wait. Amore? Amore, open the door. Amore, what are you doing in there? - The stairs. - Amore? - The stairs. The stairs. The stairs. - No, no, what's wrong? What stairs? - Are you okay? - The stairs. No, no, easy, easy, it's okay. It's okay. It's me. It's me. - The stairs. - Momo. - Momo, call Dr. Coen. - Okay. Come on. Rosa's doing better. She's calm and lucid. What's she got? I don't know. Could be anything. She's tired. I need to schedule a CAT scan for her. To check a few things. Her blood, her oxygen… They aren't flowing to her brain right. And then… What do I do with you? What about me? I'm doing good here now. Do you think she'll get better? I don't know. Maybe we should pray. I'll pray. You pray, I'll go check on her. Madame Rosa, what are you doing here? Go back to bed. It's cold. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Don't worry. I didn't feel like staying in bed. Plus, when I'm down here, I think, reflect… Iosif says this is like your Batcave. You know, he's not exactly wrong. At Auschwitz, I would hide under the floor in the barracks. It was my refuge. Just like down here. I was your age. House witch? To you this name means nothing. Better that way. Don't pay attention to what I'm saying. I'm getting old, you know. Hmm. Come here. Come here. I bought this at the market years ago. - These are mimosas, you see? - Mmm-hmm. Before the war began, my parents rented a house like this, with a big yard, right near Viareggio. In the spring, the mimosa trees exploded with yellow flowers. It was so beautiful, it made me cry. I would give up all my memories if I could just keep this one. Momo, no matter what happens, I don't want to go to the hospital. I'm telling you because, even though you're very tough, and sometimes little shit, I know you'll keep your word. - Not even if it's necessary? - No! I know what doctors are like. They will torture you so they can pin a nice medal on their asses. They experiment on you, believe me. I've been through this. And I don't want to go through that ever again. Promise me. I promise. Say it in Hebrew. It's better. Herem. Herem. I wish that I could go to school. But Madame Rosa says they'll catch me right away. Because I don't have documents. Lucky you. - Hey, is she sleeping? - Don't know. The more time passed, the more Madame Rosa had ups and downs. Some days, she was lucid, and was even able to cook our carp Jewish-style without messing up. On other days, she withdrew into her own world and would stop talking Meanwhile, I used this time to get some new clients. …my son. I love you. I'll never leave again… Come to Mommy, come. I'll never leave you again. I'll never leave you again, Iosif. I'll never leave you. I love you. I'm leaving. I'll see you later. How does this song go? Babu can play it good, I can't. I'm gonna miss you. I won't miss you. Finally, I'll have the room all to myself. I told you she'd come back for me. I will miss him, too. But, you know, we should be happy for him. It's just when you give up hope… That good things start to happen. It's reassuring. Don't blame the air conditioner. It's hotter than Algiers. Careful! I told you about Les Misérables, no? About how Victor Hugo teaches us that everything is relative? Especially good and evil. It all depends on the people you meet and how you listen to them. Momo, I know what you do at school and around here. What are you talking about? I know the people you hang out with and the guy you work for. You think of them as your family now, and that they're the best solution for your life ahead. But they're not. Are you gonna turn me in? That's not my intention. You wouldn't learn anything if I did that. On the contrary, I want you to take responsibility... What the hell do you want? You're not my dad! I don't need anything from you! I have something important to tell you. I decided to accept my father's invitation. You did? We're going to Galicia so he can meet Babu. You're sure about this? Not at all. What did I tell you? No cell phones at the table. It's not mine. It's in other room. So, this telephone, where does it come from? Who did you steal it from? Give it to me. Give it to me, please. I won't give you shit. It's my phone. Where did you get it? I got it because I'm dealing. And if you don't like it, you can fuck off. Momo! - Momo! - No, never mind. Never mind. Never mind. It's no use. It's no use. Hey. Hey, kid. I don't know how much time she's got left. But I did the only thing that I could do. At the hospital, Rosa will get all the proper care that she needs. She can't stay here. She will lose continue to lose consciousness more often. She needs to be monitored and looked after. For any eventuality, understand? Yes. It's the only solution. I get it. It's not true that nature knows best. Nature does whatever it wants. Sometimes it's flowers and animals. And other times, it's an old lady that they won't let out of the hospital. But I had made a promise to Madame Rosa. And she had trusted me. Hi. Who are you? I'm Momo. Are you pretending? I know that you're mad. I know what you want. I'm not stupid. I'll return. I'll help you. But when I come back, you've gotta help me because I can't do it all alone. Okay? I heard about the old lady. Let's go for a ride. Come on. Hey, let's go! That's what friends are for. Make yourself at home. I had plans with my son. It's his birthday today. I haven't seen him in a month. I was looking forward to it. But his mother, she never respects the rules. First, she promises, then she calls and makes excuses. It was a shitty day for the both of us, so let's celebrate! Take a seat. Hey, wake up, sit. To us. Stop thinkin' about it. You gotta look ahead. Here. What's this? It's all there. I don't get it. You're quitting? You know what your problem is? You don't think that you deserve the respect that you've earned here. If you leave here, you're done with me. You're done with all of us. Am I clear? I'm sorry. Too much? - My papa loves red. - You're beautiful. Momo, you stay with Dr. Coen. Promise? - Don't worry. - Okay. Put your seat belt on, honey. GERIATRIC WARD I'll take you where you want, you have to be quiet. I can't… I can't go anymore. So peaceful. What was that? We have to go. Morning. Okay. Will they come back? No. No. - Drink. - No. Yeah, you need to. I have something for you. Close your eyes. And then who will reopen them? You can leave them open. What's this? Mimosas. They're beautiful. So pretty. I couldn't find real ones. This is the most beautiful gift I ever received. You're a good boy. If you wish, you can come and live with me. We'll be happy together. Sit down. I'll get you some water. Momo? You were supposed to stay with Dr. Coen. Momo? Hold on. Where are you going? Momo? Momo! Wait! Stop! Momo, open this door. Momo, open! What are you doing? Momo! We'll wait over there. This film was completed during the Covid-19 pandemic. The director and producers thank the artists and crew for making this film a reality.
