She loves flowers. I got it. Bud. Bud? Bud. That's a nickname. Okay, yeah, maybe you're right, maybe you're right. Oh, ooh, ooh! You have got one brilliant partner. Okay, now, you ready? It's not exactly a flower, but... Thorn. Huh? Thorn Stewart. You need a donut. Oh, I need a donut? Yeah. Pull into the liquor store. Okay, okay. Okay, Mr. Doughboy. Now, you're the one that needs a donut. Okay. This is squad 294. We're going on a code 7. DISPATCHER: Roger, 294. Roger. Out. Oh. Hi, Mr. Police Officer. Hi there. (CELL PHONE RINGS) (SIGHS) This is Officer McCabe. Shelly! Perfect timing. Hey, Shel, what do you think of the name Thorn? I hate it. I mean, you know, like on a rose? I get it, John. I just hate it. I couldn't talk Russ out of it, Shel. He loves it. Stop trying to hit on my wife. Ha! Hi, honey. Thorn? Please. That's the worst one yet. But I forgive you 'cause I figured it was John's idea. How you feeling? About eight months pregnant, and your son is practicing field hockey in my stomach. I wish you'd hurry up and come up with a decent name. I'm trying, I'm trying. (BABY CRYING) Oh, I know. Oh, I know. Oh, it's okay. Oh, by the way, we're almost out of those little marinated onions. Do you think you could stop by the store and pick up a couple of jars? Yeah. I'll pick up a half a dozen. Anything else? Yeah. Some of that frozen yogurt I like. You know, the kind that goes so well with those marinated onions. Walk away, bitch! (SHRIEKS) Give me those keys! Let me get my baby, all right? WOMAN: Here, here, you can take the keys. Just let me get my baby out of the car, okay? Okay, just let me have my baby! Russ? Freeze! Russ! Drop the gun! (HEARTBEAT) SHELLY: Russell! Russell, can you hear me? Russ. Oh, God. Russell, please hear me! Please let him hear me. Russ! Russ! Pick up the phone! Russ! (SOBS) Oh, God, don't let this happen. It's going to be okay, Shelly. It's going to be okay. MAN: Larry, get these parasites outside now. Have they said anything? He's still in surgery, Shel. He got Enzene. He's the best. You hang in there, Shelly. He's a tough kid. Yeah. Yeah, he is. (DOOR OPENS) I'm sorry. Which one of you topless dancers was the first to lose their virginity? Huh? Come on. I guess it would be the slowest runner. (LAUGHS) Okay, I'm kidding. It's a joke, a joke. Let's get serious for just one moment. (BABY GURGLES) Which one of you has fake boobs? Okay, we're about ready to have your favorite. Mmm. Orange slimy stuff. Can you open your mouth? Oh, good bite. Good biting. You hungry? Okay, here. Here's some more. MAN ON TV: Tina, let me ask you something. Do you know what men are thinking about when they're looking at you? I mean, come on. You're a stroke magazine come to life. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Shel? Come on in, Hildy. Hope I'm interrupting lunch. You are. Here. Open wide for some orange slimy stuff. Mmm. (SHELLY CHUCKLES) Wait a minute. What is this? What is Mel Gibson doing in that highchair? I'm looking for baby John Stewart. HILDY: Oh, look at you. (CHUCKLING) Oh, no. HILDY: Look at you. (CHUCKLES) MAN ON TV: Strippers come out here in these little, tiny underwears, and they're putting money in the underwears. People, if I was a stripper, I'd have long johns on. One way that I can tell, the Max Bergman test for fake boobs. I want all you girls to get up right now and do me this favor. Just start jumping up and down. Can you believe that? I kind of like him. Come on! Hold one, shake one. Come on, girls. All right, hop. Give me a little Chuck Berry. SHELLY: He's a pig. Give me something here. Well, all men are pigs. At least he's upfront about it. (SIGHING) You know what? You're spending too much time cooped up in this place. Okay. Here's the plan. First, we're all going to go out and get some very bad junk food. And then we're going to go see this really weird antique store I know about. What do you say? No. I was just gonna sit here and have a nice, quiet lunch, okay? Come on, baby. Come on. Yeah. Want to practice? Yeah. In case you've forgotten, that's Mr. Sun. Oh, very funny, very funny. It's nice to get out, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it's nice. And it's getting easier. But I still miss him. Oh, so do I, Shel. Yeah. So do I. Now, uh, where did you say this place was? It's a surprise. Just keep walking. Come on. Oh... Down this alley? You'll love the place. Matilda's a little eccentric, but wait till you see what she's got in her shop. (BABY COOS) So? Huh? Bad taste. Weird taste. HILDY: Oh. I love that lamp. Oh. Look at that baby. It's a little strange, I'll admit. It's more than a little strange. Oh, even better stuff over here. SHELLY: The stuff in this place reminds me of The Twilight Zone. Especially that. I'll vote for that one. (BLOWING) STERN WOMAN: We're closed. (CLEARING THROAT) Um, sorry. We'll come back another time. We're always closed. Well, I guess that makes this as good a time as any. Oh, what a cute little baby. Oh, my. Oh, my, my. Ooh, coochie coochie coochie coo. Coochie coochie coochie coochie coo. Coochie coochie coochie coochie coo. Whaddya want? Well, I'm looking for a man, but I guess you don't have one on sale here. Whole or parts? How you doing, pumpkin, huh? Okay, huh? What an interesting carving. Looks like... jade with... strands of gold. Yeah, but look at it. It's kind of a creepy face, huh? Kind of reminds me of my last boyfriend. I don't know. There's something about it. Put it back, my dear. That one's not for sale. Well, it's got a price tag. No, you don't want that stone. Why? The thing has powers. Let me show you something else. What's it supposed to be? An ancient talisman. It's supposed to grant your wishes. Oh, as in, "Make a wish, and it comes true?" MATILDA: So says the legend. It's magical. I'm not sure it's for you. Let me show you something in a shrunken head. MATILDA: I think you'll like this. It's the head of a great medicine man from the Amazon. I think I dated him, too. He never called back. How much? SHELLY: Can you believe the story she made up about this rock? I still think it's kind of weird. Well, yeah. I mean, it's an ancient carving, Hildy. They all look kind of weird. Do you know how much work went into this? Please, it's got to be worth more than I paid for it. I don't know. I just... I had an impulse to buy it. Usually it's shoes, but okay. Let's make a wish. Knowing you, you're going to wish for a man. SHELLY: Hey, hey! (CHUCKLES) HILDY: Oh, come on, Shelly. Give me a break. Maybe I'm wishing for world peace. Ha. Right. Exotic male dancer. Buff... Tiny waist, big pecs, tight butt, hairy thighs... Blonde, blue-eyed, and devoted to me. I think world peace would've been easier. SHELLY: Oh, my... Oop. Got to go. (SIGH) It was fun today, Shelly. Yeah, it was. Thanks. (SIGHS) Bye-bye, baby John. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) Oh, Russ. It didn't work out the way we planned, did it? I guess we're not going to grow old together. And you're not going to teach your little boy how to play baseball. (BABY GURGLES) I wish you could meet your little boy. He's so sweet. (BABY COOING) (RUMBLING) (BABY CRIES) Oh. Just a minute, Johnny. Just a second, pumpkin. Hey. How you doing, huh? Oh, boy. You are a poop monster, aren't you? Okay, let's go change you. (CACKLING) (DOOR OPENING) (FOOTSTEPS) (DOOR CREAKING) Hello? (FOOTSTEPS) (GUN COCKED) (GUN UNCOCKED) You're not dreaming, Shelly. I'm real. Your wish came true. Russell. (SIGHS) I want to see my son. He's beautiful. I can't believe this. I never stopped loving you. (SHOWER RUNNING) Russell? I'm in the shower, honey. Oh, my God. It wasn't a dream. Russ? Why don't you come on in? (SCREAMS) Care to join me, sweet meat? Ahhh! Oh, my God! (GASPING) Oh, my God. I've waited a long time for someone to make a teary-eyed wish. Who are you? I'm the one who granted your wish. Now, give me the baby John or... guess my name. You son of a bitch! Oh! Oh... Oh... Wrong name. Now I'll have my prize. (SNARLS) (PANTING) It's okay. It's okay. (BABY CRYING) Give me the baby. Ah, yes. Mother's love. Touching. But you need not fear me. I want only... to suck the very life from him. (CACKLES) You take one more step, and I will rip your fucking head off and shove it up your ass. Ah. My heart doth quiver with fear. I mean it, you bastard. Don't bust my hump, lady. I've waited too long. Now, the baby John. Ahhh. Ah, yes. Yes. Now the pain. Ahhh. Ooh! Ahhh. Ooh... (CRYING) No, sir. (SCREAMS) You can't kill someone without a soul. What the hell are you? A bit more than you bargained for, I wager. (CACKLES) The baby John. I want the baby John. Get out of my house! No! It burns! No! No! No! (CACKLES) (BABY CRYING CONTINUES) (GRUNTING) (LOCK CLICKS) Oh, baby. Oh, sweetie. Come on. Come to Mommy. It's okay. It's okay. (BANGING) It's okay, it's okay. (GROANS) It's okay. Thy future is... harsh on thy throat. (COUGHS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Me damsel in distress seems to have fled. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) In a carriage with no horses. (SCREAMS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GRUNTS) Don't let any blood get on the baby. (CACKLING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Ahhh! The baby. Give me that baby. (TIRES SQUEAL) Ahhh! MAN: Yeah. Right, exactly. I've got them bagging it here, and we're dusting... As much as we can possibly get. I'm going to send it down with Richard. Okay? Good. You got it. (LOW) Get going. Yeah. You want another aspirin? I want the whole jar. No. I've had enough. Hang in there, kid. This, too, will pass. What happened to my life, Hildy? I feel like somewhere right after Russ died, I took some wrong turn towards Hell. Could have been one of them kids on PCP. These fucking drugs that these kids are doing today, I just can't believe it. Ben, this was no kid. No. This was some kind of satanic little freak. I mean, he had pointed ears. (SIGHS) God, you believe me, don't you, Ben? Yeah, I mean, Shel, I know you well enough to believe you. I'll tell you what... Whatever it was that went out that window is either dead or in bad need of a hospital. You know what's weird? When I hit him with my car, I thought I saw him smile. Well, we'll check the morgue, and we got all the emergency rooms covered. We'll find this rat bastard. I promise you. He wanted my baby. Hey, Shel. There ain't nothing gonna happen to that little guy, as long as I'm on this job. Hmm? Okay? Or I'm on this earth. Come on, Shelly, pack some things. You're staying with me until they find this guy, okay? You know my psychologist friend, Nedda? You know, she's coming over tonight, and, um, you can talk to her. And the three of us are going to have a romantic dinner. No men... Huh. Except for this little man here. Hmm. Lucky kid. To no more little monsters. How can I tell the police that I saw my husband? I mean, but he was there. I know he was. I know I made love to him. Shelly, our imaginations can be very powerful. Especially under stress. I know you believe you were with your husband, but I'm equally sure that you're just... trying to hang on to him. What, am I going crazy? No, no, no. Absolutely not. NEDDA: It is totally normal. In fact, you want my theory? It's just an educated guess. Go for it, Shel. Nedda's educated guess usually costs about $150 an hour. NEDDA: Rumpelstiltskin. Oh, this I got to hear. Grimm's Fairy Tales were really quite scary. Oh, wasn't that the one where you had to guess the guy's name, or you have to give him your first child? Mmm-hmm. That's what he said. He said, "Guess my name," and I called him a son of a bitch. Close. It's a fairy tale you read when you were a child. It stays with you. Look. It's right here. "Rumpelstiltskin was an evil little man "who stole the first-born child "of the miller's daughter." That is strange. That is so strange. Shelly, your maiden name is Miller. Get it? You're a miller's daughter. That is so strange. SHELLY: Are you saying my imagination did all of this? NEDDA: I'm just saying it's not uncommon. (DOG WHIMPERS) NEDDA: You know what? In my professional opinion, you need a vacation. (BELL CHIMES) Oh. It's 1:00. And I'm a working girl. I learned that during women's lib, remember? Good night...school night. Thank you. Mmm. My pleasure. (BABY WHINES) Oh... One more peek at the baby. Oh. He's so adorable. HILDY: We were thinking about keeping it. Good night, Hildy. Thanks for the great dinner. NEDDA: Ooh, boy. All right. Good night. Good night. Bye. (WHIMPERING) HILDY: Okay. I'll get you a blanket. You'll love the couch. (BARKING) HILDY: Rocky. Rocky, what's going on? (ROCKY WHIMPERING) HILDY: What's come into that dog? (BARKING) Stop barking, Rocky. It's okay. Probably a cat. But you ever notice when you get a dog for protection and then whenever they bark you tell them to shut up, there's nothing out there? (SIGH) (BARKING) All righty, Rocky. (DOOR OPENS) (BARKING) He can bother the neighbors. (CHUCKLES) Locked good and tight. Come on. I'm getting you a blanket. Okay. The couch has already been broken in. You'll probably find a soft spot right in the middle. I can't tell you how many boyfriends have slept on that couch. Well, I could tell you, but... Ooh. Here you go. (BABY COOING) Now you get some sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Okay. (BABY BABBLING) Your baby's going to be all right. SHELLY: I know. Hildy? G'night. G'night. "The little deformed man granted the miller's daughter her wish. "All he wanted in return was her first-born." Oh, boy. (SIGHS) "The villagers set upon the little man "and burned him with the only thing that can harm Rumpelstiltskin, "and that was fire and chaff." Chaff? Chaff... What is chaff? Must be like kryptonite. (BABY BABBLING) (SIGHING) (SIGHS) (SOFT TINKLING) (BABY WAILS) Oh, God. Oh, no. Whoa. It's okay. I was up, and he was crying, so I picked him up. I'm sorry, Hildy. It's just I'm so jumpy. Oh, I understand. Me, too. And what I also understand is that you're going up to my parents' cabin tomorrow for a long rest. Okay? And that's an order. (CRASHING) (HILDY SCREAMS) Shelly, get out of here! I'll take the small, gurgly one. No! Mothers! You're all the same. Give me the goddamned baby. Make another one. Shelly! Take my car. No! No! (SNARLING) Ahhh... Get out of here, Shelly! No! No... Took care of that bitch. Now where's the baby? (CAR STARTS) Stop! Ahhh! (BABY CRYING) (TIRES SQUEAL) (WHISPERING) Shh, baby, it's all right. You'll see more of me before midnight. (LAUGHING) (SIGHS) (CRYING) Come on. Shh. (STRAINING) (LAUGHING) Hey, asshole! Out of the road. Thy knight has interesting armor. And garb. Your steed. I want your steed. (LAUGHING) Little past your bedtime, huh, you little freak?

This satanic freak is after me, and I've been driving all night and my engine just blew and you've got to help me. Damn. Women look good in their underwear. What? Oh, my God. I am in my underwear. Imagine that. In the middle of nowhere, usually you see dirt. Maybe a rock. A tortoise sometimes. But legs like you... What? Did you hear a word I said? Are you crazy? I need a ride now. (BABY CRYING) Lady, listen, I'm just out for a little, enjoyable weekend of camping. I give you a lift, I'm probably going to go so far out of my way. I don't know if you got money for food or gas or anything. And you never got to the part about what's in it for me. Lady, that's a baby. You're putting a baby in my truck. There has never been a baby in my truck. I haven't got time for this shit. Just get in the car and drive. Pushy broad. Thy chariot hath many horses. (LAUGHS) (POP SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) (STRAINING) Not for nothing, but I like you a lot better in your underwear. You don't believe me, do you? Well, I mean, you kind of had me... until you got to the part where you shoved a broom handle down his throat. Yes. But he's a little hoarse. Oh, come on, lady. You got to give me that much. You shove a broom handle down somebody's throat, the guy ain't hitting the high notes anymore. You don't believe me. Believe you? A fairy tale come alive from the past? (LAUGHS) Lady, I want this guy on my show. Rumpelstiltskin? Stole babies, right? Never gave them back? He's my kind of guy. Lady, you have got to introduce us. (SIGHS) Oh, God. That's who you are. You're that asshole from television, that Max Bergman. Ohhh, jeez. Well, it took you long enough. (LAUGHS) Lady, just who is after you? (CRYING) I love it when a plan comes together. MAX: Let's review. A three-story window, hit with a truck and an arm ripped off. And he's still alive, right? (SIGHS) I don't know. The last time I saw him, my friend, Hildy... (HORN HONKS) Wow. There's a tanker coming up behind us pretty fast. (LAUGHS) It's him. It's Rumpelstiltskin. Why do you run? I only want the baby John. It's him. Oh, I get it now. This is a setup for Bloopers and Practical Jokes. Who put this together, my agent? (LAUGHS) Hey, Rumpman. Want to be on my show? He's kind of small, but I hear they're good in bed. Very aggressive. Well, it's nice to know you're an asshole in real life, too. Let's playeth tag. Ahhh! You're it! Well, he's not a good judge of distance. I can tell you that. (LAUGHS) Ow! Gah! Oh, this is fair. Skinny talk-show host versus Satan in a Mack truck. Faster. (HORN BLARING) Argh! (HORN BLARING) Pull over already. Lady, I can't handle this. I'm an asshole, not a hero!

I mean, we're not outlaws, but we might as well be outlaws. They're going to think we're outlaws... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what they do when guys flip out. It works. (SIGHS) But, look. What I'm saying is right. If we're going to survive this thing, Shh. we're going to have to start thinking like outlaws. We'll hide out in that abandoned diner back there. I'll be Thelma. You're Louise. Warmer... Hot... Hot! Run! Run! Run! Come on in here! What are you waiting for? (THUNDER RUMBLING) See, now I'm glad I got all this camping equipment. Were you really going camping in these clothes? Yeah. What? Um, here's some coffee. (SIGHS) Thanks. Thanks for the jacket, too. I'm really sorry I got you into all of this. Hey, come on. A little high-speed chase, crazy little devil trying to kill us, near-death experience... My idea of a good time. Yeah, well... Maybe you're not such an asshole after all. Bullshit.

(CHUCKLES) He's my whole life, Max. Heh. (BABY WHINES) MAX: So this is what it's all about, huh? SHELLY: It sure is, Max. Here you go, little guy. Here you go. Here you go, pumpkin. It could be your little friend, huh? Here you go. Here you go. Yeah. No, not the straw. (PANTING) It's not a fairy tale, Max. Yeah, no shit. It's not much of a vacation either. No. Rumpelstiltskin. He's real. I thought I was dreaming, but I wasn't. He was real. Okay. Let's say he's real. Explain how he suddenly gets transported to the 1990s. Uh, I don't know. I don't know. You know, these aren't bad for being three years old. Oh, my God, the stone. The what? Oh, God, the wishing stone. Oh. I brought him into my own house. Oh. Okay, okay.

Hands behind your back! Guys, just... Okay, take it easy. I'll handle this. Now... You're not listening! You're not listening! You're making a terrible mistake. I had nothing to do with it. I don't know about the woman. So this is what a couple of scumbag cop-killers look like. We look nothing like a scumbag cop... (GROANS) Do you know who I am? Yeah, you're a funnyman. I am a huge television star. Head first. SHERIFF: Get him in the car. Put the kid in the black-and-white. No, please. Don't take my baby. (CRYING) SHERIFF: Joe, secure the scene. We'll lock it down here, sheriff. (SIRENS WAILING) Thy pain is less and less. Death draws near to thee. I must have that baby. I don't believe this. You really do hold onto the bars. Did you call my lawyer? No. I called Matilda. You had one... You had one phone call and you wasted it on a witch? She thinks she can help us, okay, Max? We might finally get out of this nightmare. Well, you're a lot lighter now, young man. (CRIES) Aw, come on. There you go. All snug and dry. Aw, come on. All fine. Oh, cute. (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) Joe? You hear me? What's the problem? Joe? What's the matter? Joe, you okay, huh? Joe. You all right? Peekaboo. Peekaboo. (CRYING) There, come on. Now, let's get rid of that dirty thing. Look, sweetheart. Look, sweetheart. Oh, this one's much nicer. Come on. You're sweet. You're sweet. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Got a fresh brew, Kalish. (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) Kalish? Where the hell are you? (CHAINS RATTLING) Oh, boo! Boo! Aren't you cute? What a sweetheart. Tell me where's the baby? Talk to Rumpel. Talk to Rumpelstiltskin. SHERIFF: Who's there? What's happening? Put your hands in the air! Now, or I'll shoot! (SNARLING) Hands in the air! Have you seen my baby? Where's the baby? (GUNSHOTS) Help! Help, somebody! Can you hear us? We're in here. (WAILING) Officer needs help. This is a police emergency. My baby, my baby... Help! (GUN CLICKS) My turn. Anyone hear me? Officer needs help! Magic. Help us! We're stuck in here! Police emergency. Anyone read me? (CRYING) Do I hear a baby crying? Oh, yes, I believe I do. Get us out of here! Officer needs help! OFFICER: Don't move! Put your hands in the air! Now! Is that little Johnny? Somebody, help! Can you hear us? Help us! We're stuck in here! (SCREAMING) Ahhh! Look at you. Yeah. You don't look bad. You'll be all right. Don't cry. Don't cry... (HICCUP) Oh, I know. I know... ♪ Rockabye baby on the treetop ♪ When the wind blows, the cradle will rock ♪ Oh, God. He's got Johnny. I know it. He's got my baby. You've got to stop him. I'm going to kill him, Max. I don't know how, but I'm going to kill him. Johnny. Johnny! Come on. We're not going to find him on foot. There's keys over here. Come on! Come on! (STAMMERING) I don't know. We're lost. It doesn't make any difference. (SNORING NOISE) You hear the noise coming out of this engine? No. It's not coming from the engine. It sounds like it's coming from back here. (SNORING) Oh, God! Matilda! That's Matilda? The baby... Wake up, Matilda. Wake up! Damn it! Come on, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, damn it! Why does he want my baby? Where is he going? The next time an old witch tells you not to buy something, you listen! Matilda, what the hell is going on? Rumpelstiltskin has no soul. That's why he steals babies. He wants Johnny's soul? How the hell do you steal a soul? If I remember right... If you remember right? Come on, you're a witch. You're supposed to know these things. It's a legend, buster. My mind's not as sharp as it once was, okay? (BABY CRYING) All right, I know. You want your mommy, don't you? This will show your mommy. Okay, look, look. Just think, okay? Just think. Needs a mother's arms... Before sunrise... In a graveyard. How do we stop him? Fire and chaff. Of course! No. Chaff? What the hell is chaff? Straw, my dear. Plain old ordinary straw. How much time till sunrise? No more, witch. Now you die. (GAGGING) Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Hey! Hey! What is she doing? Oh, my God! MAX: I can't see! Lady! What are you, nuts? Hey! (GROWLING) (GAGGING) (COUGHING) (WHEEZING) What's the matter with her? She's dying. Leave me alone! Save the baby. There's a, a chant. (COUGH) Like in the fairy tale. Must say the chant... three times. (CHOKING) She said something about a graveyard. I know. Wait, okay. Here, look, look. There's a graveyard at the top of Pig Mountain. Now to the graveyard. (LAUGHING) What was it she said about a mother's arms? She said the baby has to be in his mother's arms. But you're here. That's right. That's right. I'm here. I'm not there. I'm his mother, and I'm not there. You don't have anything to worry about. Quickly, Dora, quickly. We have not much time before sunrise. You're such a devoted mother. (BABY CRYING) Into a mother's loving arms, my child. Don't cry, little child, for soon I'll have your soul. Yes. (SCREAMS) Powers of darkness, start the spell that shall free me for all of eternity! (CRYING) Shut up, foul infant. My destiny is near. Soon you'll be no more. (LAUGHING) No. Not now. They will not stop me. (GROWLING) (LAUGHING) Up there! This way. Come on, come on. Leave the baby among the dead. (SCREAMS) No! Get it off! This ain't no fairy tale. (SHELLY GRUNTS) Die, you maggot-infested freak! Ugh! Johnny! Johnny! Magic power that I drew, do my bidding to stop those two. No! (SCREAMS) RUMPELSTILTSKIN: Aw... Your poor little baby. (PRETENDS TO CRY) God, give me my baby! A deal's a deal. No! (LAUGHING) I'll kill you, you fairy bastard. (CACKLING) (SHELLY SCREAMING) No! Shelly, come on. He'll kill us. (LAUGHING) I have to save my baby! You want to save your baby? Come with me. I got an idea. ♪ La la lala, la la la lala ♪ La la lala, la la la lala ♪ Come on, hurry up. In here. I saw it when we drove past here. I think it's gonna work. Shelly, remember what Matilda said about the fire and straw? Well, if this fairy-tale thing is real, then all we got to do is get this fire and this chaff thing working, say the chant before sunrise and we can save your baby. But we don't know what the chant is. It's his name. It's in the fairy tale, Max. The miller's daughter had to guess his name. ♪ Rockabye baby, don't you cry ♪ I'll have your soul by morning's eye ♪ Mama will never guess my name ♪ Therefore never stoppeth my game ♪ Sleep tight. By morning, I'll have your soul. Of course. Move it. Go on! Pull out! (GEARS GRINDING) Right in the mud? C'mon, yeah. His fire-breathing dragon giveth out. Pity. (ENGINE REVVING) Oh, right! This is not happening! Oh! Jesus! Oh! Oh, no! No! Oh, move it! Yes! (GRUNTS) The steed lives! Chaff burning chaff! Oh, now! Oh, yeah! Who's the man? Who's your daddy? No! No! No! Ahhh! Hey, Rumpelshitskin, where you going, huh? You trying to outrun a tractor? Why don't you sit down! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) What? Jesus! Come on, you... (GRUNT) Oh! Jesus! Not now! Not now! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Move! (SCREAMS) Shit! Damn. You know that hurt! Where's Johnny? Max, where's my baby? I don't know. He knows where my baby is. Where the hell is my baby, you bastard? He's toast. Shelly! You'll never find your baby. You bitch. (SNARLS) Where is my baby? You'll have to kill me to find out. (GRUNTING) Tell me where he is. Your baby's gone. Not a chance. You're going to burn in hell. (GRUNTS) Rumpelstiltskin. Rumpelstiltskin. (SCREAMING) Rumpelstiltskin! (SHELLY SCREAMS) (BABY CRYING) Oh, God. Johnny! Johnny! He's here! Over here. Oh, God! Oh, God. Oh, he's in here. Oh, baby. Oh... Oh. Oh, baby. Oh. (BABY COOING) Hi, honey. Oh, baby. Oh, I love you. Oh... Oh... Oh! Max, you're crying. Huh? No, you know, I got a... Dust and, uh... Yeah. I love you. Let's see if I still got the old arm. Satanic fiend is rounding third, headed home. Bergman in right, rears back, fires it over the plate! And Rumpelstiltskin is outta there! Ha! Well? You know, Max, you really were a hero back there. Yeah, I guess it's the end of a brilliant career. Yeah. I'd say you're definitely out of the asshole business. So, uh... Whew! Whew. Maybe you want to see a movie with an ex-asshole? Huh? Huh? As long as it's not a fairy tale. Actually, I was thinking more of a documentary or something. Hey, how come I never get to hold the baby? You could show me how. I think the kid and I have bonded. Look at the way he's looking at me right now. That's love... or you got to change his diaper. Look what I found. Mommy, Mommy, look what I found! Mommy, look what I found on the shore. Look at the pretty colors. They are pretty colors, honey. Can I keep it? Can I take it home? Sure. It's really interesting. You can take it home.
