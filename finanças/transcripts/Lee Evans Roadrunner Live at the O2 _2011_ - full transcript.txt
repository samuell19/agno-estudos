Since the very dawn of time, primitive life-forms began to evolve into humankind. At long last, man strode the earth. - And so did woman. - Hmm-hmm! But the path of evolution was not smooth. Nature can be cruel, producing the freak disaster known as, Chimpius Sweatius. He was the man that time forgot. While early man settled quickly and successfully, Chimpius Sweatius struggled to learn the basic survival skills, such as hunting. The secret of fire. Finding a suitable mate. And inventing a new way to travel. Today, you, the audience, represent just how far early man has progressed. Incredible, isn't it? But what became of Chimpius Sweatius? It was thought that none of this species survived. Until now. So, be warned. Do not offer him food, don't try to breed with him, and definitely don't laugh. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Lee Evans! Wow! Thanks very much for coming down, folks. Thank you! Now, what are we doing here? Here, Iisten, you guys, thanks for coming down. Thanks for giving me this opportunity. Thank you so much, thank you, thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much for coming down. I really appreciate it. Oh, God! They always say, "Don't panic," don't they, when there's a fire? But Iook at the bloke on the fire exit sign. Look, straight out the fucking door, Iook at him! Women and children first? Fuck off! They're back there, mate. I was just getting ready... Strange when you put your trousers on, isn't it? You start doing all that bopping up and down, you know? Just why exactly is it when you're trying to pull your trousers up, you start going up at the same time? It's Iike you're trying to get out of the fuckers, as you're putting them on. I mean, you don't put a hat on Iike that, would you? You know those blokes who always do that when they put their jacket on? They do all the extra, "Got me jacket on, got me jacket on. "Got me trousers on..." Hey! Where are you going? Funkytown! My wife always does that. Whenever we're going out the door, "Do I need a coat? Do you think it's gonna get cold Iater?" "Oh! Oh! Oh! Just a minute, Iove. "Yeah, as you can see by the isobars just sweeping in from..." How the fuck do I know? What am I? The fucking Met Office? Oh, no, women never take a coat out. No, no, no. They don't need one. No, they've already got one. It's Iovely and warm. I should know. It's called, "Fucking mine!" 'Cause you know when you're out, and they start doing all that shit. Oh, fuck! Do you want me coat, Iove? And they're going to their Titanic, Kate Winslet on a piece of driftwood routine. "No! I'II be all right." "Here you are, Iove. Have me coat. "You know the one I brought out for me, to keep me fucking warm?" And she'II never go out the door, not without her face on. Oh, no, no! "Oh, no! I'm not gonna go out the door without me face on!" No, the fucking postman will knock on her door. "Get that. I haven't got me face on." Haven't got your face on? What, you Iost your fucking face? Oh, you can't see her real face? Oh, no, it's Iike Iiving with the Phantom of the Opera. "No! Don't Iook at my face!" Then she fucks off upstairs to put her face on. Where you going, to play your organ? 'Cause if you've noticed, all women Iook Iike that when they're doing their makeup. Have you noticed? My wife keeps telling me where she's going. She's just "nipping out to the shops" just "popping off to the toilet". Nipping, fucking popping everywhere, she is. Women have their own timing, did I mention it? No other fucker knows! What's a nip? What the fuck's a pop? Is a nip faster than a pop? You know, is that a nip? And that's a pop. I wish you'd tell us, 'cause my wife does it all the time. We'II be driving through the high street, she just gets out of the car, and fucks off, "I'm just nipping in there." Don't be fucking nipping anywhere! I'm on a double yellow Iine here. What am I gonna tell the traffic warden, when she starts nipping out her ticket and popping it on me fucking windscreen? She's got Ioads of them! She's got Ioads of 'em. She'II be going out the door, I go, "How Iong will you be?" She goes, "I'II be back before you even know it." Why are you telling me then? I wouldn't have fucking known, would I? You ever played spot the difference with your wife? It's fantastic. She goes out, gets her hair done, comes back and goes, "Ta-da!" You're standing there, going, "Now I know this one." She's Iike, "Oh, fuck you!" You're Iike, "No, no, I've got it. Earlier, you had a really happy face. "Now you got a fucked off one." Women going on about, "Men can't multi-task." I can. I can fuck up six different things all at the same time. Your wife ever asked you to undo the pickle jar? Of course. It's Iike throwing down the gauntlet, isn't it? The poisoned chalice. "Undo that for us." "Yeah, no fucking problem." Worst thing you wanna hear. "What? Can't you do it?" Yeah, fucking wait! She's Iike, "Give it here, you twat!" I've Ioosened that. We go out sometimes. We go to restaurants. If we go out, we go to... I don't Iike poncy restaurants. Where you're trying to get a drink, and the waiter just wants to take out the fucking wine guide, "This particular grape was grown on the slopes of the Loire Valley, "in the Dordogne, and brought especially for us, here." Who gives a shit? Does it taste all right? We don't tell him how we got here, do we? "I come on the bus, the traffic was shit, "I want a drink in a glass from the bar over there. "Now fucking hurry up!" I hate those restaurants! You know, those poncy restaurants where you walk in, that bloke's behind the counter, who's chucking a pizza base in the air. "Look at me!" That's not clever! Try chucking soup. "Just Iike mama used to fuck up." Hate them restaurants. Whatever you ask for, they bring you a plate, and it's got garnish on it. What the fuck's garnish? They bring you a plate, and there's a big pile of foliage. I've come here to eat, not fucking graze! But we don't ask for garnish, do we? They just give it to us. Nobody craves garnish. You don't see that woman on that chocolate bar advert, Iaying on that couch, going, "Oh, what do I fancy? "I know! Two Ieaves and a radish!" No! She wants chocolate. Have you seen that advert? She goes to the fridge, she opens the fridge, but someone's eaten her bar of chocolate. It doesn't matter. She's got a secret one under the couch, in a Iittle tin. Fuck off! Let's have that advert for real. If that woman's eaten all that chocolate, she'II go the fridge, she'II open the fridge, she'II go, "Who's eaten my chocolate? "Bastards! "It was me! "I remember now. Never mind. "I got a secret one under the couch. "Fuck it! Let's eat the couch." You always know when somebody ain't gonna make it in WeightWatchers, when you ask 'em where it is, and they go, "Yeah, you go past Greggs the bakers, "go Ieft past McDonald's, go right past KFC. "It's right opposite the chip shop, near the fucking doughnut shop!" Nobody craves garnish. Not even ifyou're starving! Never heard of a UN airdrop over Africa dropping garnish, have you? Some desperate population in the middle of a famine, "No more rice! Up to here with fucking rice! "Garnish!" And Nando's. Nando's. They're everywhere now, aren't they? Fuck, they're Iike a disease! Yeah. I see we have some Nando's fans in. Why is it, whenever you're in one of those foreign restaurants, when the waiter asks you what you want, why do you try and read the menu as if you're in that country? You try and pronounce the shit off the menu. You're Iike, "One minute, wait, wait. "Can I have the paella papa-ra-di-casa please?" Why? Do you think there's some bloke in the middle of Spain, sat in a cafe, going... How do you say, "Faggots? "Mushy peas? "Tinned Spam in a hot pot?" Gracias! No! And what is it with Nando's and ice? They're fucking obsessed with it! Every drink you ask for, there's a fridge freezer full of fucking ice cubes in it. They say the polar ice caps are disappearing. I know where they are. They're in fucking Nando's! And what bit of "no ice" don't they understand? You ask the waiter for no ice. From your table to the kitchen, he's Iike, "No ice, no ice. Okay, no ice. "No ice. Absolutely no ice. Ice, he wants Ioads of ice. Ice, ice, ice." He opens the kitchen door, "Blizzard!" There's fucking Eskimos going, "Okay, we go as quick as we can!" Next time I go to Nando's, I'm going in a fucking gritting Iorry. I got one of those the other day. An ice-cream headache. You ever had one of them? You actually stop functioning for a full minute! Stuns your whole body. Little piece of ice-cream, and you go... You know, the SAS use stun grenades to overcome them terrorists in the embassy siege? They should've just thrown in some fucking ice-cream! Go, go, go, go! Oh! Raspberry ripple! You will never catch us... They should warn you about ice-cream. Like that advert on the TV at the moment. When ice-cream strikes, you must act fast. Is one side of your face frozen? Is your speech slurred? Too fucking right it is! Then you could be eating a McFlurry. So I never get these people that go to restaurants, and they eat food that's so hot, they're in agony when they eat it, but they put up with the pain, 'cause it tastes so good. You ever see these people? You'II see them sat in a restaurant, in a hot sweat, going, "Ahhh! "I Iove a vindaloo! "I'm fucking dying!" What's the point? We all Iike chips, but you wouldn't stick your head in a deep fat fryer, would you? You're at the chippy, do you want them wrapped or open? Fucking out of me way! I Iove chips! I hate going to restaurants with me wife. I hate that. I hate when your wife complains on your behalf. Dumps you right fucking in it! You say to your wife all secretly, Iike, "Is this cold?" She goes, "Well, fucking say something!" You go, "No, no, no!" Soon as the waiter arrives, "He says it's cold." Guess whose dinner is gonna be flobbed in now? No worries, Madam. I shall heat it up for him. Toasty! It's hot in here, innit? Oh! I Iove that when you're in the hairdresser's, when they put your head over the sink. They always say the same thing, "Is it too hot?" Have you noticed they only say that after the water's coming out? You're in the sink going... "No, you bastard!" It's Iike you're being waterboarded in there. That's what you're in for, a shot back and Abu Ghraib. Where it all takes a very sinister turn when they wrap that towel around your head, doesn't it? They start Ieading you across the shop, you don't know where the fuck they're taking you. You feel disoriented. I haven't done anything! And when they tear that towel offyour head, there's a bloke standing there with scissors, going, "What do you want?" I don't want nothing, I swear! I should do more sport. I've never been sporty bloke. Even when I was at school, I was Iike a twat in PE in cricket. They used to send me out to the edge of the field, going, "Go on, you're shit!" I was always the fielder. I'd be miles from any player, on the edge of the field, on me own, going... Then what would happen is... "Evans!" "Yeah?" "I got it! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!" The javelin, you should see me with a javelin! That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Basketball, I was always more interested in the noise your shoes made on the basketball court. I tried that cage fighting. I tell you, them budgies can be fucking vicious, can't they? I bought one of those swingball sets, to play with the kids out in the garden. Even though he's a kid, you're still quite competitive, aren't you? If you're winning, you're Iike, "Skill, that is!" Skill! Ifyour kid starts to win, you're Iike, "It's 'cause you have the fucking good bat." If you manage to swap bats, and he still wins, you're Iike, "Hey, what the fucking hell have you done to this bat?" Some pastimes and exercise, I don't get. You see these people, they go on walking holidays. And how they cheat, if you've seen them, 'cause they use them ski sticks to fucking help them walk. You'II see 'em walking up a country Iane, in boots, going, "Good morning! How are you? "Lovely day, isn't it?" That's cheating! That's Iike us going swimming, having a couple of outboard motors to help us along! You don't see the bloke doing the high jump with a couple of helium balloons, do you? I tried running, I tried running. But have you tried buying a pair of running shoes these days? It's a serious thing now. You have to go to one of these hard-core running shops. And you can't just buy a pair of trainers any more, no. They take you through a whole NASA space test to see if you're good enough for the fucking trainers! I'm serious. As soon as you walk in to one of these running shops, that bloke walks up to you with really tight shorts, "Hi, there! How are you doing?" Probably noticed my knob's a Iot bigger than yours in these tight spandex. I said, "I want a pair of trainers." And he goes into this whole new Ianguage that only sportspeople understand. "What do you need the trainers for? What? "Marathon, heptathlon, triathlon? What? What? What? What?" I don't know what the fuck he's talking about! I start making stuff up, anything with "on" on the end. I'm doing a half telethon, I'm doing Ioads of fucking Mogadon. You can ram-a-damn my fucking ding-dong, I don't know what the fuck! I said to him, "I'm doing a Iot of resistance training at the moment." He went, "Really? Resistance training?" I said, "Yeah, I wanted to be go be a sport, but I can't be arsed." Next big humiliation, he puts you on the running machine. He wants to see you running in the fucking trainers. "Come on, Iet's see you on the treadmill, Iet's see you running. "Come on, Iet's go, come on, Iet's go." Fuck off! Why does he wanna see me running in the trainers? If I was buying a pair of swimming trunks, would he make me put 'em, and swim around the shop, would he? "Let's see backstroke, come on, Iet's go. "Butterfly! "Tread water for me." Fuck off! Anyway, right, I needed a pair of trainers. So I went to Sports Direct. Fuck, have you been in there? I mean, it's a fucking shambles! I mean, there's Iike shit everywhere! There is! I walked in there, I went Iike that. I'm fucking sorry about your break-in. I know that Sports Direct didn't get done over in those recent riots we had in fucking London. You know, they all ran in and went Iike that. "Fuck, this one's been done!" It's Iike a fucking Blue Peter Appeal in there. And what's the matter with the staff? They hate us in there, don't they? You walk in there and ask, "I want some trainers." He gets on that Iittle walkie-talkie, "He wants trainers, he wants trainers." Then he fucks off! Where's he gone? I know where he's gone. He's gone to pick up another walkie-talkie at the other end. "Tell him to go away. Tell him to fuck off." I notice, when he comes back, he's got fuck all I asked for. You asked for the size 10, yeah? Here's two size fives. Fuck you. Anyone that walks through the door... You ask where something is, they go, "You go to the top floor, walk around there for four days, "go to the second floor, walk around there, "come back to me, I tell you to fuck off. Now go away." And some of the stuff they sell! Have you seen it? God, who makes this stuff? A factory with no fucking Iights? Like a pair of DayGlo Iemon Lonsdale pants. Lilac jumbo sized top with extra sweat vents. Pink and ginger Ieggings. Where are you gonna wear this stuff? Unless you're going on The Jeremy Kyle Show. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You see, it's all seconds! So you're have Iike a pair of tracksuit bottoms but with a hood. And the weird thing is, is some of the people that walk through the door, it fits them! "Excuse me, my Iove. "Do you sell those gloves with the six fingers in? "Do you sell an ear muff?" To be fair, I actually did walk out of there with a pair of trainers that fit me really well. Fucking ones I walked in with. I Iove sports. I Iove watching sports. Yesterday, I was watching the Formula 1 racing. See, I don't get Formula 1 racing. Before they have the race, they have the practice race. Who else has a practice race? You never see anybody else do that, do you? You don't see that in the marathon in the Olympics, do you? Some bloke runs 26 miles, he arrives... "On your marks, get set..." "Fucking, here we go! "I've just done this." People only watch that Formula 1 racing to see if there's a crash. Have you noticed, every time there's a crash or the engine blows up, the wheels always come off and fuck off up the track? It's Iike they're trying to do a runner. They think no one's seen them. You see 'em bouncing off up the track, going, "Keep going! "No one's seen us!" They always jump the fence, try and mingle with the crowd. It's no wonder those wheels stay on that Iong. Have you seen how Iittle time those mechanics spend working on those cars? Literally, they drive into the pits, they go ape-shit for Iike three seconds, and they're gone! It's Iike... Fuck off! And the drivers put up with this sort of service! We'd never put up with that sort of service, would we? You drive into a KwikFit, and they go... Fuck off! "Fuck off"? "You haven't done anything!" "Yeah, we have. We changed your oil, new filters, new tyres. "That's practically a new car." "Yeah? Fucking when?" "Just now." "AII right, I've paid. Do you wanna see it again?" I Iove mechanics! I Iove mechanics. You ever done that? You ever broken down on the motorway? You've to phone the AA from one of those phones on the motorway? You ever done that? 'Cause they always put the phones right next to the road so you can hear fuck all! You're in the middle of nowhere on the motorway, and there's cars going... Hello! I can't fucking hear you! That's whythey call it the AA. Hey! And why is it the woman on the other end ofthe Iine, the one who's gonna take all your details down, they give her the quietest fucking voice in the world? - You can hear her go... - "Hello?" "I can't fucking hearyou, Iove!" "No need to shout." They always say, don't they, when you're broken down, "Stay with your vehicle!" Where the fuck am I going? I'm broken down! You know, I was on me way to Scotland. Fuck it, I'II skip up the M74. That's the worst one. You ever got that? You ever had a puncture and you got the wife and kids in the car with you? It's always pissing with rain, you get out of the car, you get that jack out of the boot, you think, "What the fuck do I do with this?" 'Cause it's not Iike the one at KwikFit. You know, that easy one, where they pump your car in the air. Oh, no! They give us the hard one, where you've got to wind your own car into the fucking air. Your wife's in the car, going... "Come on, hurry up!" "Out!" "Fuck off, it's raining!" "Hey! I'm not Iifting you as well, you bastards!" And you can't put them jacks anywhere on these new modern cars. Oh, no! They've got specific places you've got to put 'em. You put 'em in the wrong place, you go straight through the bottom of the car. You ever done that? Fucking hell! There's a... Fuck, you can't Iook. "I can't Iook!" You have to get someone to Iook for you. "Love, have a Iook at that. "Please tell me I haven't gone through the bottom of the car. "Please tell me!" "You've gone through the bottom of the car." Then you find 1,000 ways to say the word, "Bollocks." Bullocks! Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Bollocks! You ever do that? You get really mad with yourself, 'cause there's no other fucker to get mad at? There's just you. You start searching for things to blame. Why do you get mad with yourself Iike that? Afterwards, you don't refuse to make up, and ignore yourself for a while, do you? - Catch your reflection in the mirror. - No. Then you get that big spanner thing out of the boot, you know, that big spanner thing they give you. It's fucking huge! It's the one to do your car wheel nuts. And then you got that big spanner thing, it's pissing down with rain, you're doing this shit around your car. There's people driving past, going, "Oh, fucking hell, the Pope's broken down!" And you see, car wheel nuts are not Iike any other nut in the world. Any other nut, they undo easily, slowly. Not car wheel nuts. No, they wait. They fucking wait. They wait until you're at full strain and then they go... Your wife's in the car going, "What you Iost?" Fucking fingers. "Have you done it yet?" "I'II do you in a minute." I mean you'd put two fingers up but you ain't got any any more. So you ever put air in your tyres at the garage with an air hose, you ever done that? It's brilliant. You always go around the car with an air hose doing all that shit, you know? Suddenly you're in the fucking rhythmic gymnastics. And every time you go back around the car, you Iift the fucker in the air. Why? What are you worried about? It's gonna fucking pour out? See those air hoses, they're specifically designed that when you try to take them off your wheel all the air you've just put in comes out. Fuck it. It's Iike the car vac, you've ever got a car vac in the garage? It's hilarious. 'Cause now they give you that token you got to put in the car vac. So, now you know you're on a time Iimit. So you put the token in, you quickly race to get all your car done and then you realise at the end you've got Ioads of time Ieft on it. So you're standing next to your car holding that hose going... I Iove mechanics, I really do. I was watching the Formula 1 racing, you can hear the mechanics on the radio trying to get Lewis Hamilton back into the pits. You can hear him on his car radio going, "Come into the pits, we're doing two chamois for a pound." Have you noticed Lewis Hamilton doesn't trust his mechanics with his car? Every time he gets out the car, he takes his fucking steering wheel with him. You can see him walking off with the steering wheel going, "My car! "Not yours, mine!" Where's he going with that steering wheel? Does he get around the corner and go... And what's the matter with the winner at the end? Every time they give him a bottle of champagne he starts spraying it at everyone. See, I think these Formula 1 drivers have got a problem with alcohol. Not drinking it, spraying it. There's one in an AA meeting going, "My name's Jenson Button, "and I'm addicted to..." "Ah, you twat." He must be a nightmare to Iive with, you know? "Here, Jenson, I've made you a cup of tea." "Oh, cheers, Nan." You know, he's in the bog, you know, "Are you all right, Jens?" "Yeah, not too bad..." God. I'II tell you the sort of sportspeople I hate. Golfers. Not all golfers, keep your fucking clubs on. Just them ones when you're talking to them they mime golf swings, you know them fuckers? They're in front of you. There's no club, they're in front of you, going, "Yeah, well it's... Perhaps we can meet up next week. "Have some face time, what do you reckon?" "What the fuck are you doing?" Have you noticed they never mime any other sport when they're talking. Have you noticed that? You're not talking to them and they start doing a bit of ski- jumping, do you know what I mean? "Well, they say it's a bit chilly, yeah. Well, they say it's going to brighten up Iater." They'd freak you out if they started doing a bit of fucking wrestling in front of you, wouldn't it? "Well, I'm tied up at the weekend. "I'm sure we can sort something out." Fucking hate those guys. Do I hate those guys who ask themselves a question and answer it? Yes, I do. Would I Iike to punch them in the face? Yes, I think I would. They go paintballing on a weekend. Now that's a sport I don't get. Paintballing. What the fuck is that? Bunch of blokes running about a field chucking paint at each other. And they all take it so seriously, you know? "Get him! It's a combat sport." Yeah, a combat sport played with fucking decorating materials. That's Iike somebody running up to you and trying to fucking wallpaper you. Do you know what I mean? "Got you!" Wait. The pattern. It don't match. Paintballing's not for me. I'm married, it would never work. You'II be arguing with your wife the whole time about what colour to shoot the fucking enemy with. You'd be running across a field going, "Charge!" Your wife's standing there holding a Ioad of swatches going, "Don't shoot him with that. "That's Tuscan Sunset. "I said peach, you twat." I Iove the football, I Iove watching football. I Iove football. I Iove the goalkeepers. They make me Iaugh, you know? Have you noticed every time they throw the ball out to a player? They do it Iike that grumpy old fucker, when you was a kid and you want your ball back 'cause it went in his garden. They're exactly the same, "You want this ball, do you? You want this? "What have I told you about playing down this end. Now, fuck off down your own end." I Iike it when they take a goal kick. 'Cause have you noticed, just before they kick the ball, they do that Iittle skip. It's really weird, they go Iike... Some goalkeepers measure every single step, Iike that and then just before they kick the ball they have Iike an attack of physical Tourettes. They go Iike... I Iike it, I Iike it when the substitute comes on 'cause they always do that mad run on to the field. "You're on." They go, "Okay." What the fuck's that? "Warm up." Warm up? You never see anyone else do that, do you? Be great in the Olympics in the shooting event, wouldn't it? Some bloke gets his gun out. "Yeah, I'm warm now." See. See, I figure your average football fan is a schizophrenic. I really do. Have you ever sat next to one of them in a football match, you'd be having a perfectly normal conversation and then suddenly they go Iike that, "Yes, why that... Hey, you fucking twat! "Bollocks to that fucking free kick, you twat." And they sit back down as if nothing's happened. "What was you saying?" AII football managers to me, they just Iook Iike those pissheads at the park on the park benches. They're exactly the same. You have a Iook at them, you know, they keep getting up, you know. There's a big debate going on in football at the moment about players faking injuries, trying to con the ref. Trying to get a free kick. You know, waste a bit of time. It's fucking out of order. You never see the ref doing that, do you? Faking injury to con the players. When all the players are around him going, Iike, "Yeah! Fuck you, Ref!" You never see the ref go, "Oh!" "You all right, Ref?" "Yeah, yeah. I'II be all right, yeah. "I'II be all right. Let's just play, yeah." The only sport where you can't fake an injury? Boxing. "Good. It's working." I Iove the medics. I Iove the medics at a football match. You know, you see their Iittle face Iight up when a player goes down. They're Iike, "Oh! Is he injured? Is it me? Is he injured?" You know, they'II run on the field, "I'm coming." Have you seen their face when the player stands up? "Oh! Bitch!" I want to try me new gas bottle. These footballers faking injury is out of order. Do you know what'd put a stop to it overnight? Do you know what'd make them stop doing it? They should do what they do at the horse-racing. You're ahead of me all the time. I mean, it's fucking clever, mind. In the horse-racing... Right, the horse goes down injured, they shoot the poor fucker right there on the field. "Oh, yeah. "Pedigree Chum." Horse-racing is the only sport in the world where they try and fake being really healthy. The horse is on the ground, he sees that bloke with the gun, he's Iike, "No, fucking wait. Wait. "No, no, I'm over it, Iook! "Piss off, I've got three others here." Hear. I went horse-riding once. I went horse-riding. My mate Steve took me. He said, "Lee, for fuck's sake, relax. Take the day off." And I went horse-riding with Steve, you know? And I've never been, before. I was really nervous, you know? And I didn't realise, horse-riding is all about rhythm. It's all about... There's a slow walk. There's that one... "Yeah, this is quite good, Steve." I'm not on the horse yet. I'm just really nervous. But then there's the trot. The trot. And if you're a seasoned horse person, you'II know the trot's all about rhythm. "It's all right. I know what I'm doing. I've been doing this for years. "Up and down, just Iike that." If you don't know that rhythm, God, your arse takes a fucking hammering. You're on that horse going... "Make it stop, Steve. "I fucking hate horses!" And the gallop, fucking hell. You ever seen a horse going up the motorway in one of those horse boxes? They've always got a weird Iook on their face when they're Iooking out that Iittle window at the front, haven't they? You can see them standing there, going, "This is weird. "I'm doing Iike 50. "And my Iegs ain't fucking moving." I Iove watching the darts on the telly. You know, I don't really get darts? You know, I don't get them. The winner... He never gets a goldfish, does he? You ever won a goldfish at the fair? You ever done that? You know, they're hanging there, in those see-through bags. Do you know, I couldn't believe I won, I turned around and even the fish was Iike... Some of them, you get at the supermarket. You know, at the fish counter. Have you noticed, all the fish have got the same Iook on their face Iike someone just touched them up? It's Iike they were caught in the net and they went, "Woo woo." I noticed the bloke serving us behind the counter as well. He don't Iook too fucking good either, does he? He Iooks Iike he's been round the back having a go at the sting rays. I can see blokes going, "Stingrays? "Stingrays?" He'II be at Asda's tomorrow, "Excuse me, you got any sting rays?" Oysters. Oysters they say are an aphrodisiac, aren't they? How'd you work that out? Have you seen an oyster? It Iooks Iike Antony Worrall Thompson in the bath. I think, I think... I think I've worked out how we can win more medals at the Olympics. Charity collectors. Yeah, charity collectors with clipboards ominously scattered around the tracks. It's amazing how much speed we can pick up when you see one of them fuckers in the high street. "Ah, fuck. There's a bloke with a clipboard. Move, move, move, Iove, move." You know... Well, I hate them fuckers. You know, them buggers that jump out at you with a clipboard. "Hi! How are you?" "I was all right. Now I just wanna smash somebody in the face. I don't know why." When you see a charity collector in the high street, you always do that thing. "Can't see him. Don't Iook at him. Can't see him. "Just face this way, Iove. Just keep going this way. "Don't give him any eye contact. We can't see him." "Poor fucker's collecting for the blind." So, I was in town today. I went into HMV. Have you been into HMV? Fuck. You walk into HMV, they've got everything on, all at the same time. You walk in, they've got, Iike, a film going, they've got some music playing, the game on. You walk in, and it's Iike... "What's playing?" "Everything!" They've got their own DJ in there... "Hi and welcome to HMV. "This week, we're playing Burst Your Fucking Eardrums by Deaf Bastards." Oh, fuck off, you know? It's Iike an assault on your senses. You know, you're going from floor to floor, and they're playing, Iike, a different kind of music on each floor. It's Iike Iistening to a really shit compilation album. As you're going up the stairs, it's Iike the Ace of Spades, the "Oh, Mandy, you came to..." "Was a donkey..." "I am your father, Luke." Wild Horses... Do you know what I think it is? I'm turning into me dad. I am 'cause all I wanna do when I walk into HMV is go round switching stuff off. I just wanna walk in and go, "We don't need this on, do we? "We could probably turn this down. "Couldn't we?" Do you know, if the fire alarm went off in there, no fucker would know? "Great, techno!" "Who's this playing?" "Fire alarm." "Fuck it, I'II take it." And I hate Iurkers. I hate Iurkers. You know, when you're Iooking at some CDs, and they slide up next to you, 'cause they wanna Iook at what you're Iooking at. They got the whole shop to Iook at, but no, he wants to Iook at what you're fucking Iooking at. You can feel him next to you, you know? Breathing, hovering, Iurking. "Fucking, go on then!" And you got to queue. I hate queuing. I always end up in the middle of the queue, you know? Between the display and the till. You have to keep making that gap to Iet people through. "Go on in, yeah. Go on. "Couldn't have fucking gone round, could you now? "Go on in, you as well, go on, you as well. "Don't worry about me. I'm fucking Checkpoint Charlie, here. "People are going, 'Please, Iet me through, I have a passport. Please.' "Go on, go on. You as well. Go on." And I step back onto this bloke's foot. Have you ever done that? Why is it when you step on someone's foot, suddenly they change into a pedal bin. Last weekend, me and my missus, we went to IKEA. Have you been in there? I didn't realise when you visit IKEA, there's certain rules you gotta abide by. Like, you have to follow that route they'd marked out for you on the floor? You know, that yellow brick road that Ieads you deeper and deeper into the world of fucking wood chip. "Hello! "Hello!" And you can't stray from that path. Oh, no. "Don't stray from the path." You take a shortcut around the back of the wardrobe section and you come out somewhere in fucking Narnia. Well, it's IKEA's version of Narnia. There's a Iion with a couple of screws missing, only three Iegs going, "Woof." You end up in one of those mock-up Iiving rooms they got in there, you know? With the cardboard telly and the hi-fi. This whole family's in there, going, "Help us!" "Please help us. "We've been here for years. "We strayed from the fucking path." Rule number two. Always decide what you want before you arrive at IKEA, 'cause all their products have Scandinavian names. You'II end up arguing with your wife in fucking Swedish. You will. You'II be standing in the middle of IKEA, fighting over the catalogue going... You don't want to be standing there going... You sound Iike Benny and Frida before fucking ABBA broke up, you know? "Fuck you." "No. Fuck you, too." I Iove the office chairs. I Iove the office chair section in there. It's brilliant. They got the artificial Ieather swivel number with the high backs. Have you seen that one? Who's that for? Fucking paranoids. "Who's that? "Who's that?" They got that one for bad backs. Have you seen that one for bad backs? You know that one you got to kneel on? That's really good 'cause you know what, that really does give you a fucking bad back. Now you're at your desk, doing your accounts, Iooking Iike a fucking giant parrot. I Iove those executive chairs with all the hydraulic knobs and handles. One yank of that Iever, and you fucking hurled forward. What's that for? In case you have something really quickly you gotta Iook at? "What the fuck is that? "Might be important. No. It's nothing." I Iove those executive chairs, you know? They got that one with the rocking motion, you know that one? That's fuck-ass brilliant, that one. And then, after a couple of weeks, the bolts start to come Ioose, and you start rocking the other way. Soon as the cashier's got your money, and you're through the tills... "You're on your own." Have you ever tried pushing a flat pack wardrobe out of IKEA on one of their trolleys? 'Cause their trolleys are different from everybody else's. You got that big wheel in the middle, and two small ones on either end. So, you're trying to push it out of the door, doing all this shit, you know? Your wife's at the other end, pulling it, doing all this. Suddenly, you Iook Iike you work for the fucking railways. "Keep pumping, Iove." "Okie-dokie." Get that trolley outside, and conveniently, IKEA had put them posts up, so you can't take the trolley more than five feet outside the door. "Hey, thanks for the use of your trolley between there and fucking there." You can see your car in the distance, across the car park going Iike that... "I'm over here." You're standing there, going, "I'm not gonna make it." You know, the trolley's down there going, "Sorry, I can't fit through the bars. "Sorry." So, now you gotta carry this flat pack wardrobe across the fucking car park 'cause it's deceiving. It just Iooks Iike a flat box. No, that's a king-size wardrobe in there, that box. You know, your wife's going, "Go on, pick it up. It's only a flat box." "I'II box you flat in a minute." You're trying to pick up the wardrobe, and you're straining in Swedish. No one in their right mind would try and carry a wardrobe across the car park. We was out shopping just now. We have to buy a fucking wardrobe. I mean, you don't go shopping with your wardrobe, do you? You know, you walk into Top Shop, "It's all right, Iove. "I don't need a bag. Just aim the fucker in there, I'II be fine." See, I think furniture's quite cheap these days. I really do. Like for instance, when I was a kid, we had fuck all in our flat. Nothing. We had that really cheap carpet. You know, that nylon stuff that would start to stretch after a couple of months? And then it would rile up and you'd have that big ridge that went across your Iounge? Even though you tripped over it a million times before, you're Iike, "Morning... "Sorry." Then after a couple of weeks, our Iounge had turned into a dolphinarium 'cause me dad would go, "Come on, Iet's sort out this fucking carpet. "Come on." Do you know, the carpet... I never got that fluffy bit of carpet your mum used to put on top of the bog seat. What the fuck was that for? What, are you gonna have a Iittle stroll after a big shit? "Empty." AII that thing did was make it more comfortable for the burglars getting in through the window. Can't stand shopping. I can't stand shopping. It's Iike, ifyou noticed all the adverts on the TV at the moment give you that Iittle reason, you know, to buy stuff? Have you noticed that? Have you noticed that? They give us a reason to buy stuff. They something Iike, "Because you're worth it. "Because capturing the unexpected, matters." Why? If you're in a shop and you wanna buy something, you don't need to state a reason to make it easier to buy, do you? If you want some bog-roll, you don't say to the woman behind the counter, "Come on, girls. 'Cause I'm dying for a shit." If you're buying some Durex, you don't say to the bloke behind the counter, "Because capturing the unexpected, matters." I Iove that. I Iove watching TV with my wife, you know? Have you ever had that ridiculous conversation with your wife when you're watching telly? It's hilarious. Your wife would turn to you and she'd go, "Hey, what time's that programme? "Is it five or six?" And you'd go, "I don't know. Five." And then, she starts talking to dead people. She'd go Iike, "Is it five or six? Is it five? "Is it five or six?" "Who the fuck are you talking to?" Chatting with Derek Acorah. You ever seen him? Derek Acorah? He's hilarious. He's on at about 3:00 in the morning, and he'II Iead a bunch of celebrities round a cold, dark cellar of an old house, and he'd go, Iike, "Hey, have you noticed? It's gone all dark and cold!" It's probably 'cause we're not in fucking Barbados. Oh, psychic conversations go on all the time in our house. You never know when the spirits may visit. You ever had that pointless conversation with your wife? It's dead quiet in your Iounge and suddenly your wife will turn to you and she'd go, "What?" "You all right, Iove?" "Did you just say something then?" "No." "Ahh!" No, Iisten, it's weird in our house at the moment. My wife's going through a change. It's fucking weird. We get all done up to go out. She spent ages doing her Iipstick but putting it around her eyes. She's had a mood swing. I said, "You're having mood swings!" She goes, "No, I'm not." And her temperature's all over the place. What is it with women, anyway? You get in bed with a woman at night, they're fucking boiling in bed. It's Iike getting in bed with Flame from The Fantastic Four. You're Iike, "Good night, Iove." And she'II Iay there all night, going, "Oh, I'm fucking freezing. "Lee, I'm fucking freezing. Get us hot water bottle. Lee, go and get us..." She wants a hot water bottle. That's a passion killer in the bedroom, isn't it? You don't see that in the porn films, do you? Some woman standing there with no clothes on, going, "I am cold." You know, the plumber walks in, "I know what you need. "Hot water bottle." See. I don't get hot water bottles. They smell of rubber, make funny noises and when they get old, they Ieak. It's Iike having your nan in bed with you. See. I've been married for... 28 years now, I've been married. Can't stand the woman. I'II tell you what, she can't half take a punch. I'm only joking. I can see your faces, "Yeah, he fucking Iooks Iike one of them." I'm only joking. I Ioves her. See, I don't Iike weddings. They make me nervous. I went to a wedding a couple of weeks ago. You know, when you're in the church, and you're asked to sing hymns... I don't know any fucking hymns. So, you're always standing there, doing that catch-up shit. You know, you're standing and going... # Praise Him, praise Him # You're always next to that fucker who wants to show off his amateur dramatic skills. He thinks he's on Songs of Praise. He's right next to you going, # Morning has broken # I hate them fuckers. They always harmonise Happy Birthday at somebody's birthday, you know. # Happy birthday to you... # "AII right, mate. It's only Iittle Jonathan. He's only two." It's not the Albert Hall, Mr Fucking Go Compare." I don't Iike weddings. You know, when you go to a wedding, you're all on edge, everyone's nervous, you know? You're going into the reception hall, and you start holding the door open for somebody. You start doing that nervous Iaughter, you know? "After you." They're doing the same back to you. "No, after you." We're both standing and Iaughing at a fucking door. And you see, that Iittle Iaugh, that's acceptable. You can't do too much. Otherwise it Iooks fucking mental. You know, if you're in a restaurant... You know, when you're at the table, you don't want the waiter to arrive at your table and go, Iike, "Is everything okay with your meal?" I mean, if you're in hospital, waiting for a major surgery, you want the surgeon to arrive at your bedside and go, Iike, "Hello. I'II be performing your gall bladder operation today, - "- so nothing to worry about there. - AII right." That Iittle Iaugh. That's acceptable. What you don't want is some blokes who arrive at your bedside and go, Iike, "Hello. "Your gall bladder's coming out today." "And guess who's got the knife?" That would shit you up, I think. You see, you can't over agree with somebody. That Iooks mental as well. You know, if somebody says, "Doesn't the bride Iook Iovely," you can't go, "Ah! Yes! "Fan-fucking-tastic! "Sex on Iegs!" See, all the relatives Iurching into the reception hall. Have you seen that Iot? It's Iike Night Of The Living Dead, isn't it? AII your relatives Iurching in through the hall, you know? Some of them are only hanging on 'cause they know there's fucking free food going. "Scrounging fuckers." They will sit around the tables, everyone puts on airs and graces. You know, your Aunty becomes the fucking Duchess of Kent. She's sat at the table, "Oh, what a Iovely occasion." "Oh, Iook, they're serving Iuncheon." Gives it away when she starts eating though, don't she? Stuffing food in the gob so fast, she's got shrapnel wounds round her face. There's your Nan on the other side of the table. She's eating with her mouth open, you can see it all fucking going around. It's Iike watching a fucking service wash, you know. And there you are following two tomatoes going around, going "Help us. "Please. Help us." And you know, the bride and groom... Halfway through the evening, the bride and groom start wandering around the tables, don't they? What's that? They become Iike waiters. They arrive at your table and go, Iike, "Is everything all right? "Is everything all right?" What do they expect us to say? "No, the soup's cold. Take it back to the fucking kitchen." We don't get the widow going round at a wake or a funeral, do you? You're not walking around the tables. "Are you miserable? "Good. "Is everybody fucked off? "Fantastic." Have you noticed how knackered they are when they get to your table right at the back of the reception hall, the bride and groom? 'Cause every table said the same thing. "Oh, this must be the bestest day of your Iife." "It was until table 13, now I just want to fucking shoot myself." You always get that wanker on table four, you know? "Virgin white. I don't think so." "Thanks, Dad." Then you got the highlight of the evening the best man's speech. Everyone Ioves the best man's speech. And I feel sorry for these best men 'cause they've been practising for months and months. But they always forget one thing. Microphone technique. Soon as the stand up, they fuck it up. Soon as they stand up. "Is this working? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? "Great. Now, as you know, "me and Darren, we've known each other since we were, oh, fucking, what, that..." "Anyway, Iet's hear it for the bridesmaid. "Let's hear it for the bridesmaids. "Now we got Nan with us, it's Iovely to have Nan with us, "so a big wave to Nan, everyone. "Fucking bitch!" You always get that Iittle toddler, you know, wander onto the dance floor, during the speeches, you know, about 18 month old kid. You'II see him just wander out Iike... You know his mum comes out, all embarrassed, "I'm so sorry." No! Fuck you. Three hours Iater, his dad comes out doing exactly the same thing. Pissed out of his head, you know? That same woman comes out, you know, "I'm so sorry." Fuck you. Such a relief, isn't it, when the speeches are over and the disco starts, you know? Your nan's up, she's got terrible arthiritis, but she Iooks fucking brilliant during the techno numbers. Why is it when you're at a wedding, you're having a really good time, you're on the dance floor, you're having a really good time, and women can do that great thing... Your wife ever do that to you? They can change your whole mood just by the power of suggestion alone. Your wife ever do that? You'II be on the dance floor, and then your wife will suddenly slide up to you and go, "Now Iisten, right... "I'm gonna tell you something now, "but when I tell you, right, don't go fucking nuts, sweetheart." Now, you're already, "What the fucking hell is it?" "Tell me!" And they make it worse by going Iike, "'Cause I know what you're Iike. "I know when I tell you this, you're gonna go fucking off on one, you really are." Now you at full, "What the fucking hell is it?" And then she says, "See, that's why I can't tell you anything." Then you start doing a bit of angry dancing you know, Iike you're driving a forklift truck. "Fuck him." Oh, blokes have got Ioads of them. There's the bus driver. There's the helicopter pilot, you know. Ever had that argument with your wife? You're winning, she starts to cry. That's it, you're fucked. Crying is the most potent way of winning an argument. You go, "Yeah, fuck you!" She goes... "Oh, sorry, Iove. "My fault." You always know when a woman is really angry, 'cause if you've noticed, their words get further and further apart. Have you noticed that? "Don't... you... dare!" "Fuck, she's angry." Ladies and gentlemen, the Iovely people who run this amazing venue, asked if we could have a break in the middle of the show... I don't mind, Iook at the fucking state of me. I'm gonna go sit next to the fire. Um, but just before we go into the break, can I take this opportunity in thanking you so much for giving me a chance. Thank you for being my friend and coming down and Iistening to the material. Thanks, folks. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back on to the stage, Mr Lee Evans. Thanks, man. Thanks for coming back. I really appreciate it. Thank you very, very much indeed. Uh, did you get a drink? Has everybody got a drink? Do you know, I hate when you offer to get someone a drink but they turn it around Iike they're doing you the favour? I fucking hate that. "Oh, go on, you forced me." "I'm going to get you one now, you twat." I used to hate that. I used to go out and get really pissed and you come home and your mum and dad are still up. I used to hate that, 'cause now you got to concentrate. You got to choose the right words that make you sound sober. Do you know what I mean? You're sat in the Iounge with them and they go, "You have a good night?" You go, "Excellent." "Where did you go?" "Excellent." So, I was out in London Iast night, you know. And this pisshead, he comes up to me, he is Iike, "Oh, you got any spare change?" I said, "No, I got exactly the right amount." I mean, what's the odds in that? So, they got this bloke in the middle of Trafalgar Square paints himself gold. Just stands there all day doing fuck all, Iike that. Just does nothing. I was thinking to meself, "What happens when he gets home? "How does he relax? 'Cause he has done fuck all, all day." He must get indoors and go, "Fucking hell, I fancy a jog." Hey, Iisten, it takes years to Iearn to do that, you know, fuck all. If you get really good at it, you get head-hunted and you get really top jobs at the post office. Well, have you been in there? It Iike prison visiting time in the post office. You walk in, they're all behind the glass, "Help us. "I want to die." Listen, I watch them prison films on the TV. Where they got talk to them through the glass and the telephone. I always just want somebody to go Iike, "What are you wearing?" Mobile phones I don't get. Have you noticed all blokes now, when they text, they make sure they put in... they put in kisses at the end. Have you noticed? "Yeah, see you tonight. Kiss, kiss, kiss." What's going on? You wouldn't do that if you met your mate in the street, would ya? "Yeah, we'II go out tonight, we'II do some alligator wrestling. "Eat Ioads of red meat. See you Iate, Pete. Muah, muah, muah." Come back here. You either get one of those smiley faces at the end of the text. You ever get one of those? "Having a really good day. Hehe." Fuck off. Or you get one of those sad faces. You ever got one of those? Do you know what I mean? At the end of the text. "Not having such a good day today." You wouldn't do that to your mate, would ya? "You all right there?" "No, not too good actually." So, the other day, I was staying in this hotel, and they had a telephone in the bog. In the toilet. What call is that urgent that you are going to make it from the bog? You know. "Hello? Is that Dyno-Rod? "You better come quick, it's got me around the neck." I hate calling my parents. I can't stand calling my parents. I call my mum up for a chat, you know and me dad starts speaking in the background. I end up having a conversation through me mum to me dad. After I have had that Iittle conversation, my mum goes, "I'II put your dad on." She puts me dad on and then my mum starts speaking in the background. I end up having a conversation through me dad to me mum. It's Iike talking to a spiritualist, but they still fucking alive, you know. Me wife walks in the room and she'II go, "Oh, tell your mum..." Now there's a conversation going on through me, via my dad to me mum. And when they come over to our house, not a fucker says a word. Why is it when women get on the phone... As soon as women pick up the phone, they start doing all the extra stuff around the house. As soon as your wife picks up the phone, they doing fucking fake dusting around the house. "Oh, hello! Yeah, Well, that's what I said. "Yeah, that's right yeah. Yeah, that's right." Fuck's that? Suddenly, they change into a hotel inspector you know. They start going around the house, going Iike, "Yeah, well, no, Thursday is good for me. Thursday, yeah. Yeah, yeah." Have you noticed when blokes pick up their phone, they start readjusting, they start moving stuff around. "Hello, Pete. No, not too bad. "Nah, just moving things around, you know. Readjusting, that sort of thing." Have you noticed, when your wife's on the phone there is a Iot of mooing going on, isn't there? When she is on the phone with one of her mates, she is Iike, "Mmm. "Mmm. Yeah." It's Iike Iistening to a shit episode of Countryfile. But it is... I Iove the O2. It's fantastic, it is. I Iove it. You know, 'cause I have been doing Ioads of travelling. I have been doing Ioads of driving and all that, you know. If you do a Iot of driving, you need your sleep ifyou do a Iot of travelling. I need at Ieast seven hours kip, I may not sleep Ionger, but them cars, they won't fucking steer themselves. Because I hate when you are asleep and somebody wakes you up, but you're still in your dream. Somebody wakes you up, you go, "Fucking hell, Sheila! "Sorry, morning, Sharon." People are always surprised by time. Have you noticed that? People are always going, "Bloody hell, it's 3:00. Fucking hell, it's 5:00." Why, you know, we should have a speaking clock that goes, "On the third stroke the time will be, 'Fuck me, it's 9:00." I got stuck in road works, on the way into the O2. You know, by the Blackwall Tunnel. Fucking hate road works. They always have that sign saying, "Slow." I think we should have a sign we can stick out of the car window, "Get a fucking move on then." Parked me car in the multi-storey car park. There is a sign on the way in to the multi-storey car park, "Maximum height." But it shows you on the way out as well. Bit fucking Iate now, innit? I get in the car... You always know when you wife has been using the car, 'cause you get in and she has done something freaky with the seat. Who the fuck drives Iike this? So, you actually get there, even before you even arrive. I do Ioads of driving. Loads of driving. It's strange when you are driving behind somebody, isn't it? They are driving really slow, you are Iike, "Come on, mate." There's some accident happened... "Fucking drivers." Strange when somebody is driving behind you, they are rushing you. Different story, isn't it? Suddenly you're Mr Highway Code. "No. "Says 30, I'm doing 30." You the... You ever been behind that police car, and they're doing 69? You're Iike, "Come on, man, it's Iike fucking 70, come on!" And then suddenly they pull over, now you got to overtake them. You're doing one mile an hour more than him. It takes you fucking two hours to overtake him. Don't Iook here, don't Iook here. Don't move your Iips, don't move your Iips. I do Ioads of night driving, Ioads of night driving. Driving at night, you're trying to drive carefully and safely so you got your full beam on. And then someone comes in the opposite direction, so you turn your full beam off but he fucking keeps his on. So then you start flashing it, "Hey, mate, you got your fucking full beam on!" He's Iike that, "I was just about to turn mine off, "but I'm fucking keeping it on, you twat." Now you start beam jousting, "Come on, fucking come here..." "Fuck you!" I'm blind! The moths, they Iove a bulb. They Iove a bulb, don't they, moths? Oh, yeah, you'd be driving up a country Iane, and you see a moth go, "Oh, it's a Iight! "Oh, it's coming this way, I Iove Iights. Yeah, yeah, yeah..." So, you've ever seen one of those dogs on a retractable Ieads? You ever seen that? They actually think their owners accidentally Iet them go free. You can see them go, "Fucking hell, I got a bit of room here. Hold on. "Yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free... Ack!" It's Iike ducks... Why do ducks eat bread? How the fuck did they get taste for that? They got no baking skills, have they? You don't see David Attenborough on the TV going, "And here we see in Greggs the baker's, "the mallard holding a Iarge sliced Ioaf." You ever chucked the duck a whole slice? They get fucked up, don't know what to do with it. They start pecking at the middle, you know. Next, he's wearing it. He suddenly Iooks Iike fucking Shakespeare. "What is this I see before me? "Granary bread?" And why do tiny Iittle birds this size have to sing their fucking heads off early in the morning? You know, they're up in the trees at 4:00 in the morning, Iittle bird this size going, # I'm singing my tiny little fucking head off # And they're always so happy, aren't they? # I'm so happy # You never hear any miserable birds in the morning, do you? Up in the trees, doing a couple of Morrissey numbers, you know. # Every day is like Sunday # See, that's how birds communicate. They have to sing. To a bird, everyday is just one big musical. You know, the birds in the trees going, # I see some worms, Yes, I do, yes, I do # Yes, I see them too, Yes, I do, yes, I do # I'm going to bed now # Well, shut the fuck up then # I saw pigeons. You never see a pigeon all alone, do you? They're always with a bunch of other pigeons in the middle of town. You know, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, they're all fucking hard in a gang. You ever Iooked at a pigeon? You ever Iooked at one? They always Iook Iike they can hear something upstairs, don't they? I got completely Iost coming in to the O2. I got completely Iost. It's no wonder with all the fucking one way systems around here. Even the signs go Iike, "I don't know." I had to ask somebody for directions. Isn't it funny when somebody asks us for directions, isn't it? Isn't it funny how helpful you are depending on what they Iook Iike? You know if somebody walks up to you in the street and they go, "Excuse me. "Could you tell me where the Iibrary is, please?" You're Iike, "No!" Oh, but if it's a tall, blonde bird, "Excuse me, could you tell me where the station is?" "I fucking Iive there!" Take me home, I can Iick your windows. Ever asked for directions and they end up asking you for directions? Have you heard about that bloke? He goes, "Excuse me. "Do you know where the station is, please?" And they go, "Yeah, do you know where the garage is, in the corner?" "No." "Well, do you know the exhaust centre on the roundabout?" "Fucking no! "I'm the one who's Iost, remember? Fuck off, I'II ask somebody else, you twat." So, when you're at the Iate night SPAR shop. That bloke behind the counter trying to give you directions. You're in one of the aisles and he's going, "Just there on the third shelf. I can see it from here, you fucking idiot." You're in one of the aisles, going, "Where? Where? I cannot see it. Where? Where?" "Just there, you fucking fool." You know, it turns into one man and his dog. "Yes, that's it, that's it. Bring... Bring." Got me shopping online in the end. Have you got your shopping online from Tesco's or Sainsbury's? And that bloke brings it to your door and he goes, "Sorry, we didn't have any cereal. "So, I put some cat Iitter in." Is that okay? I mean these blokes just make random stuff up and put in your fucking basket. They arrive at your door and go, "Sorry, we didn't have any cabbages. "So I put my shoes in." If we shopped the same way as him, we'd be knackered. You'd be in the shop going, "Oh, they've got no bananas. "Fuck it, never mind. Crankshaft. "Same thing." People say the most ridiculous things. Like the other day, I was standing next to a door, and a bloke went Iike, "You can't stand there. That's a fire door. "If there's a fire, people are going to be running out of there." I said, "I won't be standing here, will I? I'II be running with every fucker, you twat." Ridiculous! The other day I was standing on the platform of a station, and an announcement comes over the speaker, "The next train is a non-stopping service." I'm standing there, a train went... What's the point in telling me that? That's Iike walking over to the guard going, "See that train? I'm not getting on it." That's Iike one of us running past the station, going, "Hey! I'm not coming in." Same thing. And what is it with those people that get up out their seats to get off the bus or the train and you jump in their seat and it's fucking hot, isn't it? You think, "How can someone's arse generate this much heat?" "Oi, nuclear arse!" Remember as a kid, your dad had an Austin shitmobile for a car? You know everything in it was that black vinyl plastic. When he parked that car in direct sunlight, oh... When it was time to get back in the car, if you'd undone the door, it's Iike you'd undone a fucking pizza oven... AII your fringe is gone, your eyebrows. You pull the seat back to get in the back, couldn't touch the seat. You're Iike, "Fuck..." You know your dad would get in the car and try and drive but everything is hot, the fucking door, the seat, the steering wheel, the gear stick. He'd Iook Iike Mick Jagger having a fucking driving Iesson, you know. You know, us kids in the back all doing this, you know... Me mum's up front fucking doing this, me dad's driving Iike this. People are waving at us as we go down the street. "Fucking hell, the Rolling Stones are on tour again." Why is it these days, people in cars, right, at Ievel crossings... You know, they're perfectly rational people until they see that barrier start to come down, they're running a Iittle bit Iate and the train's coming. They sit and go Iike, "Here's me in the Fiat Uno, "a small crushable object, made mostly from plastic and alloy. "And here comes a huge fucking train doing a 100 miles an hour. "Let's see if I can beat it." "Fuck!" What did they think? The train driver was going to swerve? I don't Iike travelling on the train Iate at night. I can't stand it. I always think the bloke with the mad swivelling eyes is going to Iunge at me and go Iike, "Hey, tickets, please." Well, you got to be careful on trains now. You hear all these stories about people getting mugged. You know, they say in case of an emergency on a train, what you've got to do is you've got to pull that emergency cord. Yeah, that's great, that's great. That stops the train. Don't stop the mugger though, does it? Now, you're miles from any station and there's some bloke standing in front of you, going, "Good. I've got more time." And you know, some idiots, they want to pull that cord just for a Iaugh. Why do they give idiots that? The option to stop the train? That's one of the train's major controls. That's a handbrake, that is. That's the driver's job, not our job. They don't give everybody a steering wheel to use on a bus, do they? You know, everyone's on the bus, "I want to go home." "Fuck off. We're going to Lidls." You've got to be careful these days. Criminals are harder to spot, you know. Remember years ago? Muggers and hoodies stole your money. Do you know what they call them now? Bankers. Yeah. Oh, yeah, years ago, a bank raid would have a bunch of blokes with shotguns, run into a bank and they'II go, "Hey, give us all your money." They put the money in the bag and they fuck off. Not now. They run into a bank and go Iike, "Hey, give us all your money." They're already behind the glass going, "No, give us all your money." Yeah. Years ago, if someone stole millions from a bank, they'd get 10 years. These bankers get a fucking bonus. That's what they're saying to the government. "If we don't get our bonus, we're going to relocate abroad." Well, that's Iike a mugger running up to one of us in a dark alley and going Iike, "Oi, give us your wallet." And you go, "Fuck off!" He goes, "Right, I'm off to Tenerife then." They're robbing us blind and the government is Ietting them get away with it. They even get to advertise on the TV now. Have you seen this advert? Have you seen this one? Do you know what that is? Do you know this? Heh! That's the sound you make when they've got you by the bollocks. Oh, yeah. Fucking hate... Santander, Santander. What kind of name is that for a bank? Santander... Santandan dan daan... That's what they do, when you go and you say, "I'm not going to meet my mortgage repayment this month." They go, "Dan dan daan!" "Hey, it's not funny. I've Iost me fucking job!" "Dan dan daan!" "And the missus just fucked off." "Dan dan daan!" Fucking hate the insurance companies. Fucking hate them. The way they bombard us with TV ads on the telly until we sign up, but you have an accident, they'II try anything to avoid paying up. They send round the claims investigator, to see if we're Iying or we're just bonkers. As soon as you start to tell him what happened, that's it, you're fucked. "Well, it all started when I saw the singing fat bloke floating over me Vauxhall, going # Go compare! # Well, I'm not mental or anything, so I had a chat with a talking telephone and rung up the Russian meerkat. Well, he was the one who put me in touch with that talking bulldog. Do you think you're going to get anything after that? Oh... No. Estate agents? Fucking hate them. Well, have you had one of them show you round a house? They think we're idiots. They keep stating the obvious. They will. They walk in the toilet and go, "Toilet." "Yeah. I fucking know." They walk into the kitchen and go, "Kitchen." "Yeah. I fucking know." I mean, you didn't state the obvious earlier, when we walked into his office today. "Lying twat." Solicitors? Fucking hate them. Well, they've got a scam going, don't they, those solicitors. They've created their own special Iegal Ianguage only they can understand, then they charge us 500 quid a second to tell us all what it fucking means. I had to go and see one of those buggers a Iittle while ago because I wanted to buy me a house, right? He gets out all this paper, starts babbling about all this made-up bullshit. He's Iike, "Henceforth, you shall be the said ven... dor." Vendor? Fuck, I thought I was Lee. Now apparently, I am Vendor. Vendor? No one uses Ianguage Iike that any more. This is the 21st century. You know, no one uses arcane Ianguage Iike that any more. You know, we're trying to buy a two-up, two-down, and this fucker's trying to sum up the devil. You Iisten to him when he's reading off that paper, you know. You know, "The Ieaser by the deed of covenant should grant from this day forth, "by the beard of Zorro..." Does that mean we can move in next Tuesday then? High court judges? Fucking hate them. Well, why are they still wearing wigs? It's ridiculous. Surely, we've all grown up by now. We're supposed to take this all so seriously. Some mass murderer's been sent to prison for the rest of his Iife and he's been sent down by some bloke dressed up as a cocker-fucking-spaniel. And we all know it's not his real hair. It's Iike being sent down by Widow Twankey. See, judges have a full wig, right? Barristers, slightly smaller wig. What about coppers then? They enforce the Iaw, don't they? They don't send them out wearing a bald wig on, do they? That would freak you out. If a copper turned up at your door, you know, at 3:00 in the morning, give you bad news dressed up as fucking Grasshopper. "Bad news, I'm afraid. "Your husband, he dead." Everyone's on a scam. Everyone's on a scam. The other day I had to book a flight on one of these cheap airlines. They got a scam going, haven't they? You got to do it all yourself. You have to get on the airline's website, put all the details in for them, choose your own seat, weigh your own Iuggage, so you're not overweight, print out your ticket on your printer. Fuck! I only wanted to go to Tenerife, I didn't know I was working for the fucking company. I'm getting worried whether they're gonna give me the time offwork to go on this trip. And have you been through security Iately at the airport? They still make you take your shoes off. Do you know why? In case you wake up that bloke staring at the x-ray screens. Oh, yeah, you're going through security, no shoes on, doing all that shit, you know? You can see him over there staring at the screen going... I Iove that at security. I Iove that when you go through security, you know, they make you take your shoes off and your belt and your jacket and your bag. It all goes in that tray, goes through the x-ray machine. You're actually saying to the security bloke, "You know, these terrorists, "they actually think they're gonna change the way we Iive our Iives. "I don't fucking think so." You know, you're standing there, stark-bollock-naked. Some bloke behind you wearing white gloves going... "Not going to change my Iife." "Everyday's a crack." Now, if you see an unattended bag Ieft somewhere, you go, "What the fucking hell's that?" Years ago, if you saw an unattended bag, you'd go, "I'm having that." Then you got to go through that big metal detector. You know that big doorway one. The one meant to pick up any metal. Have you noticed? Have you noticed? It is made of metal. That's Iike having a sniffer dog that's into fucking drugs, you know. Gotta find some soon, man. I'm getting the heebie-jeebies. Now, you are just about to climb aboard a jet-powered machine that engineers have spent years eliminating drag and turbulence, so, you can meet speeds of 500 miles an hour at 37,000 feet and destinations far across the planet. But they overlooked one thing. One tiny design fault that fucks all that up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The queue in WH Smith's at the airport. Fuck me. Have you been in that queue? It's the most miserable conga in the world. There's people in that queue that have been there for years, going... You know, they always have two people on the tills. Unless they are really busy. Then they just have the one. Which is why when they call the flight, you're Iate for the gate. You're running up one of those moving walkways, dragging the bag behind you on wheels. Have you noticed that it starts to make that suggestive growling noise Iike it's getting turned on? Have you noticed that? You will be walking up one those moving walkways, your bag will be behind you going... Ifyou're really Iate, it starts to get really sexed up. If everyone's Iate, sounds Iike a fucking orgy... "Oh, yeah, do me. Do me big time. Do me." "Do me"? Where the fuck did that come from? If I said that in our house, my wife would go Iike that, "Fucking what?" "You know, do me, do me." "I'II do you in a minute, you chimp." You get to the gate, you get to the gate at the airport, there are those smug fuckers at the gate, the speedy boarders. You know them fuckers that paid extra to be fast-tracked at the front. You can see them standing there going, "I think you'II find I'm first." Tosser! You know, he's gone for his pre-flight checks, you know, polo neck. Check. Corduroy trousers. Check! Really small penis. Check. He thinks he is going to get on the plane first. I don't think so. You know when that EasyJet woman starts speaking into that microphone... "Speedy boarders and passengers with children only, please." When that comes out the speakers, that's translated into, "Ready?" "Bundle!" Everyone's Iike... "Fuck off." Love seeing the faces of those speedy boarders, when they realise that they paid extra to be fast tracked onto a fucking bus. Have you ever been on one of those buses to get to your plane? Have you ever checked out the driver? They are fucking mental! That's why they put him behind glass, to protect the passengers. You can see them in their Iittle cube going... You know, they've got that Iittle hole to put some meat through? Soon as he's got you all on his fucking bus, he pisses off across the tarmac, overtaking jumbos, cutting up 737s. You all in the back hanging on, you know. "What is he doing?" You all Iook Iike the back end of a butcher's van. Do you know what I mean? You get to your plane, you know, you walk up the steps and there to greet you at the door is... Orange-face Phyllis. 'Cause everyone who works for EasyJet's fucking orange. And the trouble with EasyJet is everything is orange. So, all the staff keep merging into the background. You're getting on the plane and hovering in front ofyou is, Iike, a hairdo with some teeth. Welcome to EasyJet. Fucking hell. And have you tried these seats on these cheap airlines? Have you tried the seats? The captain comes over the tannoy and he goes, "Once we're in the air, you'II be able to kick back and relax!" Yeah. Have you tried pressing that Iittle button in your arm rest? Try pressing it. Fucking... That's it. That's it. That's all you get. That's it. Kick back and fucking relax? What's this? Hobbit fucking airlines? Because they always say when you're coming in to Iand or you're going to crash, put your seat in the upright position. What, what, what... That's gonna save my fucking Iife, is it? Not only is this a shit amount of room, but now, you are one inch closer to the ground, the very thing is fucking gonna kill me! In fact, you gotta crash to get more Ieg room. "Oh, now that is what I call Iuxury. "What you reckon, Iove? "Love? Where the fuck did she go? "Well, she wouldn't be needing that now, will she?" Then you get them fuckers, you know, the Iatecomers, who turn up on the plane Iate and start trying to get their bag in their overhead Iocker. Oh! Now, you're sat there with some stranger's knob coming at you. I didn't know the in-flight entertainment was dogde the dong. "Help! "Fuck off!" He is out there going, "Oh you, fucking..." Ah! Hate them fuckers. They've always got that huge bag that doesn't comply with handheld Iuggage regulations. He is still trying to squeeze it in there. Looks Iike he is trying to squeeze Anne Widdecombe into a fucking bread bin. You Iook out the window, there is the ground crew. I Iove the ground crew. There is always that bloke with that headphones plugged into the plane. I always think, "That's the biggest fucking iPod I've ever seen." There is always that bloke as well, isn't it, going around the plane with a clipboard, ticking stuff off, you know. Just before you take off, going around the plane with the clipboard going, "Mmm-hmm." 'Cause that is what you don't wanna see. You are on the runway, you are just about to take off, you Iook at your Iittle window and you can see him down on the tarmac, go, "Ah! What the fuck's that? "What the fuck is that?" You know, you are staring at that window going... 'Cause they always say your Iife jacket is under the seat. But you never really check, do you? I mean, you have a Iittle feel around, you know? You'II come across that bloke's shoe in the seat behind. "Sorry." 'Cause you know that's what is going to happen. You're hurtling towards the ground at 500 miles an hour, you in a blind panic will be trying to get a fucking shoe on your head. You know, you're pulling on the Iaces. "Mine is not inflating!" Have you read the safety instructions on a plane? They actually give you instructions on how to use a sick bag? What, we don't know how to be sick into a bag? You're just about to ralph, you got it on your head, going... Does anyone know how the fuck this works? And you're sat in your seat, you got a five hour journey. You are sitting there going, "This is OK. I can sit here for five hours. Quite comfortable." Suddenly that woman gets on the plane and sits in the seat in front of you with that kid who won't stop fucking crying. He only stops when he pokes his head over the seat in front of you and you go, "Boo." Then his mum's face appears in the Iittle gap between seats and she goes, "Oh, you found a friend there!" "No, I don't want a fucking friend!" 'Cause you know what's going to happen now! She is going to have a fantastic journey and you are going to be Barney, the purple fucking dinosaur. You're still sitting there three hours Iater with that kid poking his head... "I fucking hate kids." Four hours Iater, he's still doing it. You're Iooking at the door going, "If that door opens, I'm fucking jumping out." After five hours of this, the kid pokes his head above the seat in front of you go... Everyone in the seats behind you is Iike that, "Fucking well done. "If you weren't going to do it, I fucking was." Have you ever done that with a kid? "Hello". And they just burst out crying. It's 'cause you Iook fucking mental. You ever caught your reflection in a shop window doing that? "Hello. "Oh, fuck is that me? "I could Iook Iike a child snatcher. "Hello." Soon as the plane's off the ground, it turns into a shop. Orange-face Phyllis gets on the speaker system, tries to make all the shit merchandise she's flogging sound really classy, you know. "Welcome to easyJet Boutique and Bistro. "Why not celebrate flying with us with a half bottle of monkey sperm champagne." "Or why not treat yourself to our exclusive Iimited edition range of cosmetics "endorsed by some slag off the telly." According to her this is the place to shop. Get the fuck out of here. At 37,000 feet there's some woman banging on the door trying to get in. "Let me in. "I want some of your Oil of Olay. "And some of your Iip balm..." Pick up the in-flight magazine. That's been well-thumbed, innit? It's always got that map on the back, you know with all those arrows pointing to all the countries that stewardess has been done by the captain. "Over and out. "Roger. "Roger, roger, roger, roger, roger." Have you seen the price Iist for the drinks on these cheap airlines? Costs more than the aftershave. I thought, "Fuck it." I bought a bottle of Aramis, drunk that. There's more alcohol in it and it's cheaper. I Iove that when you Iand, you're all getting off the plane, they stick Orange-face Phyllis on the door going, "Goodbye. "Hope you fly with us again soon." Of course we are, you brought us here. How the fuck are we going to get home? I Iove that when you go on your holidays you always get into that holiday spirit, don't you? You know when you're away and it's sunny and stuff Iike that. You always get talked into buying that really shit sombrero by that friendly bloke down at that Iocal market, you know. "Oh, senor, that sombrero that is you." "Do you think so? "Do I Iook fucking mental?" Your wife's right next to you going, "You Iook just Iike the Julio Iglesias." "Fucking do I? Do I Iook fucking mental?" You notice when it's time to come home, the closer and closer you get to Britain, the more that hat start to Iook shit. You're walking through the airport. "I feel Iike a bit of an arse actually." You know, you're by the automatic arrival doors... Twat. I used to Iove going on holiday when I was a kid. I used to Iove that. When your mum used to take you down to the seaside. Your mum and dad would take you down to the seaside. Your mum would always make you go into the sea. "Come on, in the sea. Come on, it's good for you." Have you noticed as soon as it's starting to rain, "Come on, out, you're gonna get wet." I used to Iove that when I was a kid. Remember going to the Iocal park when you was a kid? Your Iocal park where you Iived? And you used to slide down that metal slide in your shorts. You know, all the way down, you're Iike... Spend the next two weeks at the fucking burns unit, you know. I used to Iove it out there. Remember the giant spring? Remember that big giant spring thing you used to sit on, remember that? You ever seen a grown adult get on one of them fuckers? You ever seen that? "Look at Daddy, Timmy. Look at Daddy. "Fuck, my face. "Ah, me head. Go and get Mummy, Timmy, quick." There was a roundabout. Remember the roundabout? AII the older Iads would make the smaller ones get on and they'd fucking spin it, wouldn't they? "You Iittle bastards." You would be on there at mach five, all your skin's coming off, you know. Be breaking the speed barrier, kids flying off all over the estate. When you got off that roundabout, it would take two weeks to get home because you have to keep waiting for the fucking path to come around. You get indoors, your mum's Iike, "You been drinking?" "I've been on the roundabout." "You've been drinking roundabouts?" I Iove kids. I Iove kids, you know. As soon as you have a kid, all your relatives come around, don't they? As soon as you have a kid, all the relatives come around. They all say the same thing, "Oh, he's just Iike his dad. He is just Iike his dad." And then someone will make that sly comment, "Yeah, he's Iying about for nine months doing fuck all, Iiving off her." Do you ever get somebody show you their kid, he's just been born, he is really fucking hairy. You ever see... You know, someone shows you the kid, it's got Iike a beard and a hairy chest. "What the fuck is that?" It's a fucking wolf-boy. "Hello." I was an ugly kid. I was ugly when I was a kid. Oh! I was really dumb as... No I know, I can see your face. Not a Iot has changed. I was really dumb when I was a kid. Like, now for an instance, now I use an accountant, right. I have to because I can't count. In maths at school, fuck, you should have seen me. You know, you use to sit and do your times table. We use to sit in the dumb row, in maths and do the times table. You know, you use to do that. You used to sit and go Iike... One's two's are two. Two two's are four. Three two's are six. I never Iearned any maths. I just Iearned that rhythm. I use to just sit there and go Iike that... So I go and see my accountant and he is Iike that. He is Iike, "So, what's your outgoings for this year, Mr Evans?" I go, "That's easy. That's..." And we believe he knows what he is talking about. He's got an office, he is wearing a suit. He knows what he is doing. Yeah, but you never see him working out in front of you, do you? I bet when you Ieave his office, he's Iike, "Goodbye, Mr Evans, don't worry, we will take care of everything. "Goodbye, goodbye." Somebody else who can't quite add up... I went to a shoe repairer the other day, but they can cut you a key in the same shop. Who come up with putting them two things together, keys and shoes. I think it's the bloke who works in there. Have you seen him? He's had his tiny fucking mind sniffing that glue all day. You walk in that shop, he's always behind the counter going, "Yeah, keys and shoes, you know me." He's always got that black patch around his nose where he Ieant too far on his Iathe, you know. "Fuck it!" Keys and shoes. Who come up with putting them two things together? Was the first key-cutting shop a really fucking Iong walk away? Some bloke walked for days... "I walked for days to get this key cut. "Couldn't do my shoes, could you?" You can call up an emergency Iocksmith 24 hours a day. They come right to your house, change all your Iocks. We had to do this a Iittle while ago. This Iocksmith come around our house, he knocks on the door. My wife went, "Well, answer the door." Then I went, "No, Iet's see how fucking good he is." Well, you got to be careful who you Iet in your house these days. Oh, yeah, you hear all these stories. My wife, she's a highly intelligent woman. We needed a plumber a Iittle while ago. She gets one randomly off the internet. I said, "Well, who is he?" She said, "He's a plumber." But if he was a murderer he wouldn't have that on his fucking website, would he? Big picture of him holding a knife going, "No job too small." You see all these programmes on rogue traders. You Iet a plumber in your house. You know he's gonna have a go at your pipes when you are not Iooking. Anything to get more money out of us. He'II stand in your kitchen and go Iike, "Yeah, I can see your problem. "What it is is you're highly gullible, you see? "For example, when I stick my screwdriver in that pipe, "and when I take out, there's water pissing out there now. "I mean that's not right. And your boiler, don't get me started on your boiler. "Look at this, Iook. "Look at that. "Someone's been having a go at that with a fucking hammer." Oh, you watch Crimewatch which shakes you up. On Crimewatch they all say the same thing. "Beware of professional conmen." What? What? There's amateur ones out there then, is it? You know, some bloke knocks on your door. "Hello, Iove, I'm from the telephone company, come to read your meter." So, when I was a kid, we were worried about security where we Iived. But we couldn't afford a bigger dog. So my mum just backcombed the Jack Russell. I mean you watch the news, it shits you up. Did you see all the riots in London? Have you noticed, everytime there's a march that goes through any city, the bloke at the front with the megaphone, have you noticed? He doesn't know what the fuck he is doing there. He has to ask everybody else. "What do we want?" Everyone has to tell him, "No more cuts." "Oh. "When do we want it?" "Now." "Oh." You try watching the news. You can't watch the news any more. It's impossible. They've got the football scores going across the screen one way. The Dow Jones index going across the screen in the other. You paid a million quid for a giant flat screen TV and they squeeze the news reader in a four inch gap going Iike that, "Here is the news." It's impossible. They try anything to stop us from watching the news. They say, "The next piece contains flash photography." What they are saying is that they don't want any epileptics to see what's coming up next. Fucking Ieave them alone. What if you suffer from that and you're a photographer, it must be a nightmare. "Have you taken it yet?" "Fucking hell, are you all right, mate?" They try anything to stop us watching the news. They say, "The next piece contains graphic scenes "that some viewers may find disturbing." I don't know about you, but the first thing I reach for is the remote. "Shut up. There's something fucking good on for once." And the satellite Iink. Good Iuck with watching the satellite Iink on the news. You can't watch it, it's impossible. They keep Iosing reception. They go, "And now over to John in the middle of Libya." There's some bloke in the middle of Libya going, "I am in the middle of Libya." You're sat there going, "Fuck, I didn't know the King's Speech was on tonight." They have no news for deaf people. Because that's on at 3:00 in the morning. What they are saying is all deaf people are insomniacs. And they don't get to find out what's going on until that bloke pops up in the corner and starts to tell them. Do you know what he is saying? Go to bed. It's 3:00 in the fucking morning. You must be knackered. I saw this the other day. I can't believe this is on our TV. Unbelievable. Try channel one million, have you seen this? The Babestation. What the fuck! There's a woman on a bed, with her arse in the air doing that... What the fuck! She Iooks Iike a stranded walrus on the bed in a pair of pants. And she's on the phone. Who the fuck she on the phone to? Ringing the RSPCA... "Help me. "I got something jammed in my arse." Sometimes you will be sat there and there's two women on that bed with their arses in the air. I mean you can't concentrate. I keep thinking our bathroom needs regrouting. Why is it, whenever you see a picture of a glamour model, they always stick their arses out Iike that? Why? You know, because all blokes go, "Cor!" If you actually met a bird Iike that, it would freak you out. "Hello, darling." "What the fucking hell's wrong with you?" "Nothing, I'm a glamour model." It'd be Iike going out with Eddie the Eagle but he never fucking Iands. Embarrassing Bodies, have you seen that? Why do they put that on at tea time? Why the fuck they put that on at tea time? You'II be tucking into your sausage, eggs and beans and there'II be some bloke on there with piles hanging out of his arse. It's called Embarrassing Bodies. You'd think the people are embarrassed to talk about what they got. Are they fuck! They are dying to tell us what they got, ain't they? "So tell us your embarrassing problem." "Well, it's a bit embarrassing really. "So, that's why I'd rather you point that huge big camera at my hairy man bag. "So the millions of viewers across the country can have a right good gander. "My front pouch in high def." That's Iike going to the doctor's and he takes you out into the waiting room, he pulls your pants down and goes, "Can everyone see this man's all cock and brown?" Gok, have you seen him? Cock more Iike. "We gave her a brand new Iook and she Iooks fantastic." He humiliates women all the way through that show. Puts them in front of mirrors, tears their clothes off. "'Cause, hey, you Iike disgusting, girlfriend. "Dis-gus-ting." Then he gives them a new dress, a makeup job and he goes, "You Iook fantastic. How do you feel?" "AII right now you not fucking shouting at me." The Time Team. Have you seen the Time Team? Is it me or do they all Iook Iike they cut their own fucking hair on that programme? They dig up a skeleton, they all stand around the hole going, "What do you reckon killed him then?" I don't know. You've just taken two tons of dirt off of him. Does that word "suffocation" mean anything to you? Went on that Cash in the Attic. I took all me beams and insulation, got 50 quid. It's not fucking bad, you know. You pick up a newspaper, everyone's talking about germs. I went to Subway, the sandwich shop, the other day to get sandwich. Have you been in there? They got all the staff now wearing white hygienic gloves. I've only come in for a ham and cheese bap. Now it Iooks Iike I'm in for fucking major surgery. It's so they don't contaminate your food. Yeah, that's great. But old Doctor Feelgood behind the counter over there, the bloke's serving you, he keeps the gloves on for everything. Oh, yes, he has taken your money. He's using the till, cleaning out the bins, going to the bog. He actually hands you your change still wearing the gloves. So that's 20, 30, Streptococcus, hepatitis C, goodbye. Oh, yeah. Now we all got to wash our hands, there's signs everywhere. "Wash your hands. Wash your hands." That's why I don't Iike using public toilets. Because some fuckers, they don't wash their hands. So, us Iot, take all the time and the trouble to wash our hands in a public toilet. When you go back to the door again, to undo the door, as soon as you grab hold of the handle, you might as well have hold of somebody else's knob. You got the full George Michael right there. Have you had the flu jab yet? I got mine in Superdrug. You can get it in Superdrug, I am not joking. Because I won't go up to the doctor, not for my flu jab. Because he push you in that waiting room where every fucker's got the flu. And I'II always be sat next to that bloke who turns away to sneeze, but fucking towards me. Cheers, mate. Now I got the flu, thank you. Why do these people have to sneeze so Ioud? Have you heard them? You can hear them in the high street from miles away. Fuck, is that your nostril? It's a bodily function. Do you think he does that with other bodily functions? Passes wind. On the other side of me in that doctor's waiting room, I got the other type of sneezer. The nearly sneezer. You know those people, they go to sneeze, you dive for cover and they don't. They just sit there for hours transforming themselves into a werewolf with fucking sinus problems. They just sit there going Iike... On the other side of the room is the rat impersonator. You know those people that sneeze but they hold it all back. You're on the phone to Rentokil. Got one, big one, fucking massive. In the end, they got my injections in Asda's. Who thought Asda's would be giving us our flu jab? Do you think in the future they will be taking on more medical procedures you normally get on the NHS. One day you will be in the queue in Asda's, right. Some bloke will be having a heart attack and the cashier will go Iike, "Clear. "No, we've Iost him. "Do you have a Ioyalty card?" You have got to Iook after yourself. You know I go for all me checkups. I don't Iike going to the dentist. I hate it in there. Because they now make you wear those huge plastic glasses. Fucking why? Why? Why? When you go to the opticians, they don't make you wear pair of giant joke shop goofy teeth, do they? I've kind of upset our Iocal optician. I've upset him. You know when he asks you to read the wall chart when you go for your eye check? As a Iaugh, I thought I'd read it all as one word. Just to Iighten the proceedings. So I sat there and went... You should have seen the optician, fucking nothing. Some Polish bloke in the corner going... I don't get it in the optician's. He turns the Iights out and asks you to read the wall chart. What am I, a fucking bat? And why they have to come in so close to examine your eyes? He is right here. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Fucking hell, if you can't see from there, mate, we are both fucked. You know, when I see him real close, Iike that... When I see him real close and he goes, "What can you see now? "Just sit there, just sit there." Then go Iike, "I see dead people." Shits himself. You have got to Iook after yourself. I am getting older. It's starting to kick in, I can feel it. I feel sorry for old people. That Michael Parkinson keeps scaring old people with that advert. "Are you thinking of dying soon?" Keeps offering you a free pen or a travel clock if you tie up to his plan. Fucking hell, just a minute, I am just about to drop dead. Wouldn't it be best to send me a fucking stopwatch? You know when somebody is getting too old, you see 'em at Christmas, trapped in a bean bag and they can't get out of the fucker. Ever seen your nan trapped in a bean bag at Christmas? She Iooks Iike an overturned turtle in distress. In your nan and granddad's house? You ever done that trick? That's hilarious. That one. You arrive in your nan and granddad's house, you press the doorbell, you can see them come up the hallway through the frosted glass, you know, there's your grandad in front... "Wait a minute, fucking wait a minute." There's your nan right behind him, "Wait a minute!" They Iook Iike they're driving a really slow motorbike, you know... You're nan's trying to Iisten through a one mile an hour slipstream, "Who is it?" "It's Lee." "Lee who?" "Lee, your grandson." "Lee, is that you?" They do that caution shit but they still go out the door to see who it is. "Oh, it's you, we never see you." "That's 'cause you never open the fucking door." They Iet me in, we're all going up the hallway towards the Iounge, right, there's me grandad in front, you know, there's me nan, there's me, do you know what he Iooks Iike? The evolutionary chart. I'm sitting in the Iiving room, my nan walks in with a cup of tea. "Here, Lee, cup of tea, here Lee." "Cup of tea, for you." Cheers, Nan, there's fuck all in there, now, mate, that's Iovely. One Christmas, right, she bought me an Etch-a-Sketch. For Christmas, I spent fucking ages doing her a picture, I handed it to her, she went... "There's nothing on it." Every year that went by, my granddad's trousers would get higher and higher and higher. Used to sit in the chair and go, "I ain't got Iong Ieft, you know, not got Iong Ieft." I know, in a couple of inches, you're going to fucking suffocate. You've got to Iook after yourself. I hate going up to the doctors for my checkup. I hate it, he keeps wanting to Iook up my arse. He's obsessed with Iooking up there. I think he Iost his Rolex. Remember the Iast time he had it? "I know, I was Iooking at that monkey boy's arse." He says I've got to go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. I told him where to stick that. He said, "That's exactly where it goes." Gives me this special stuff I've got to drink. It's in a sachet, I've got to mix it up myself, clean my insides out. Fucking hell, they don't warn you what happens after you drink it. At Ieast AI Qaeda, before they attacked, that Bin Laden used to send us a video. I was drinking this stuff and the spoon I used to mix it up with, started to bend in my hand. I put the glass down, I thought I'd give that a couple of hours to work its magic and one second Iater, there's noises coming out of my backside, very similar to a vu-vu-fucking-zela. I tell you what it was Iike. It was Iike somebody shot Miles Davis during a trumpet solo. It warns you on the packet to stay near a toilet, why even put that? What it should have said, was wear a really good pair of running shoes and some blocks. 'Cause I'II tell you something, there ain't nothing gonna stop you now. So, "Get out of the way!" You're running through your house, the kids are coming towards you, "Dad!" "Fuck off! "You don't realise." You're running up the stairs, there's the dog. You know, you get to the toilet door... Who the fuck's in there? Your wife's on the other side ofthe door, going, "Fuck you, I was here first." "You don't understand. "She's gonna blow!" "Get the fuck..." "Hey what the fuck..." Why is it when you're really dying to go to the bog, you know, your bog turns into that game show, with Phillips Schofield, The Cube. "Your arse is about to explode. Do you accept the challenge?" "Too fucking right, Phillip. "Lock the door, Iid up, pants down... "No bog roll. Fuck you, I can do this, Phillip." Soon as your arse touches the rim of that toilet, it opens up Iike the bomb bay doors of a B-52. "It's burning!" You are now re-enacting the opening scenes to Saving Private Ryan. "My arse has got me pinned down, over. My arse has got me pinned down." In that film, Tom Hanks is always trying to get off that beach, you do the same but every time you get off the toilet, you're Iike, "I can walk! "No! "Ah, are these my kidneys? "I've never eaten this much in my entire Iife. "This is fucking somebody else's, this?" Anyway, I go... I goes up to the hospital and that's when the humiliation really starts. I'm sitting in this room, right, in the hospital, the nurse walks in and she goes, "Hi. Is there anybody we can call, "in case of an emergency?" I went, "Yeah. A fucking ambulance?" She makes me wear one of those hospital gowns that gapes open at the back. Now I Iook Iike a fucking human wigwam. These Indians had names Iike Sitting Bull and Fighting Bear, what's mine? "Show Us Your Fucking Arse." Anyway, I go straight into this room and there's the doctor with his team. And there's a bloke holding a camera on the end of a tube that's on a roll. It's on a fucking roll. He said, "Did you know the human colon is 35 feet Iong?" I said, "Yeah, but you don't have to see it all?" I mean our Iounge is only nine by ten, I haven't fucking seen all that yet. Anyway, he Ieaves me on this bed and he goes, "Now, just relax." Relax? While you stick that up my arse? Oh, yeah, this what I always do to fucking unwind. He's got this thing, in my arse, right? He Iooks at the monitor screens, you know what he Iooks Iike? He Iooks Iike he's filling up at a BP station. Anyway, I went back to the doctor's, for the results. Really good results, no Rolex. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.
