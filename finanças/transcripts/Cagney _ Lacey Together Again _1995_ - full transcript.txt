(Multicom Jingle) (gentle music) - Please, spare some change, huh? - No, no, I've given more than my career. - Ah, you order a lot. Your mister come home? - No, my husband's still in Washington, but I haven't eaten all day and I'm starving. Here, the rest is for you. - Ah, thanks. - Thank you, Mr. Song. - Be careful. - Lady, spare some change? - Sorry, not tonight. - Oh, please. Anything would be a big help. I'm really hungry. - Look, there's a shelter three blocks over on 2nd. - Hey, lady, look, I'm a veteran, I was in the Gulf War. Look, I just wanna show you something here. - Hey, back off, friend. You hear me? It's time to leave me alone. Okay? - Yeah. Look at you, you rich bitch, don't tell me can't spare a poor man a couple of bucks for food! - Let me show you something. I am a cop. Here's my, hey! Hey, that's my dinner! (thrilling music) Stop! Stop, thief! Somebody stop that guy! - Hey, buddy! (body thuds) (car horn honking) (tires screeching) (car horns honking) - Taxi, God, this stupid-- - [Christine] Get up, get up, you're not hurt! - [Taxi Driver] Crazy predator! - I hope you have insurance! - This was not my fault! And I'll be damned if my insurance is gonna go up 'cause of some stupid, homeless bum! - Come on, lady, it was just some food! - Yeah, but it was my food! - Hey, you saw what happened! You're a witness! I wanna cop here! Somebody call the-- - I am a cop! - Why can't you just leave me alone?! - Just calm down! - All right, all right-- - Damn it! - Somebody call the cops! You're just standing around in a flock! Hey, come back here! (thrilling music) - Hey, stop! Ow! Ow. Damn it! Ow. Ow. Ow. (Christine panting) If you're still here, forget it! You win. Bon appetit. - I didn't do it. I swear, I didn't. I didn't-- - What do you mean you didn't do it? You took my damn dinner! I saw you take... (mysterious music) Oh, god. (people chattering) (cameras snapping) - You know who the stiff is, right? - Thought it was just some homeless guy. - Not just any homeless guy. That's Earl Yeager. - Doesn't ring a bell. - You must have seen it. It was on all the news shows. He gets cranked up by angel dust and he comes down here and he terrorized all these people in this one co-op. - Oh, yeah, I remember, I read that. Is that him? - It was. And the co-op's a half a block up the avenue here. Suggests something, don't it? - Well, certainly narrows the immediate list of suspects. Are you gonna send someone up there? - Sergeant Rogers, it's for you. - Excuse me a minute, Lieutenant. - There you go. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - 1811-10. - Rogers here. - Enjoying yourself? - The orange-flavored beef's too spicy. - Lieutenant, we may have narrowed the list of suspects to one. - Hey, hey, you hurting me! I didn't do nothing! I didn't do nothing! - So what kinda case you got on this guy? - Are you kidding? He covered himself up with the dead man's jacket, get this, with a bullet hole in it that matched exactly the fatal wound. - That'll be a buck. - Thank you. Not only did he have the murder weapon in his pocket, he also had a very expensive bottle of Scotch and $28, which one of the tenants in the co-op said Yeager stole from her. - Neat. Your foot seems okay. - Oh, yeah. Better take this bandage off before I go to Washington tonight. - What's it, another fancy party? - I know it sounds glamorous, trust me... Look at this. You wouldn't think one homeless bum killing another homeless bum would end up on the front page, would you? Chance Tucker. - Chance Tucker? - I could not remember the name of the guy we arrested. It's right here, Chance Tucker. What's the matter? - Let me see that. - Mary Beth, what's the matter? - I don't know. I don't know yet. (phone ringing) - Today, we're talking with men who cheat on their wives and do not admit their shame. Bert, you were talking today, you've had multiple affairs and you don't see that there's any problem with that. What's the deal there? (TV clicks) - Hello. - Harvey? - Yep. - I thought you'd still be out doing your walking. I was gonna leave a message. - I just, this minute, walked back in the door. What are you doing, checking up on me? - Listen, Harv, did you used to know a person called Chance Tucker? - The nightmare on East End Avenue began four years ago. Earl Yeager was arrested last April, but, as usual, he didn't stay incarcerated for long. So why can't the police keep Earl Yeager off the streets? According to a police spokesman, if prisoner is under the influence-- - Old news report on Earl Yeager. - Known as PCP, police procedure is to take him to the emergency room, who, in turn, transfer him to a state hospital where he spends a few weeks before being released again. Earl Yeager promises that, this time, he'll get a job and stay off drugs, but that's a promise these people have heard before. Six co-ops, six families, living in terror, and as of today, the tenants of this building on East End Avenue still feel like prisoners in their own homes. (TV clicks) - Well, as you can see, this hasn't been the city's finest hour, so we need a quick disposition. I just need to tie up one loose end. - The lack of gunshot residue on the coat. - Exactly. I you want to send Angelus to find someone who saw him wearing a different coat. - Mr. Feldberg, pardon me, Detective Angelus is at NVD, but I could do it. My husband, he used to work with Mr. Tucker. In fact, that's why I came in here, to speak to the lieutenant about this case. - Yeah, but, Lacey, you had a report due today, didn't you, the business and professions code offenders? - Yes, sir, but I could do that on the weekend, get it in to you on Monday. And this way, I can assure my husband that it's a righteous bust, arrest. - Well, I don't think-- - Sure, why not, here. This should start you off. - Thank you, Lieutenant. Mr. Feldberg. - [Mr. Feldberg] I wish you hadn't have done that. - Why not? If there is anything, she's gonna find it. I'm sure it has a lot higher priority than some code offenders' list. - Cagney, just so you don't think I'm sandbagging you later, unless I find some money somewhere, I'm gonna have to cut out a position in the department and Lacey doesn't have any senior-- - No, she needs this job. - Look, it's nothing personal. Just don't say anything about it, okay? There's nothing definite and I'm still trying to find my way around it. Okay? - Pardon me, ma'am, are you Gloria Phelan? At the shelter, they told me I might find you. - You a social worker? - I'm Mary Beth Lacey. I'm an investigator with the District Attorney's Office and I understand that you're a friend of Mr. Chance Tucker. - I'm his fiancee. - Oh, I see, congratulations. Did you see your fiance yesterday? - Sure. You got a cigarette? - No, sorry, I don't smoke. Can you remember what kinda coat Mr. Tucker was wearing yesterday? - Same thing that he always wears, a long slicker. You sure you don't have a cigarette? - No. Sorry. Could you describe this slicker? - It's white. Used to be white. Down to his ankles. Chance, he dearly loves that coat. - Okay. - Nice and warm and waterproof. - Thank you very much. - Guy who gave it to him says it's the same thing cowboys in Montana wear. - Thank you, ma'am. What was the last time that you saw him? - I don't like to sleep out like he does, so I have to get back to the shelter, or they lock me out. Besides, he had himself a bottle, and he wasn't in a sharing mood. - Yeah, what time was it, though? - Just before eight. - Are you certain it was before eight? This is important, Miss Phelan. Are you certain that he had the bottle just before eight? - Sure. Why? - Okay, bear with me here. What kinda liquor and where'd he get it? I'm Mrs. Lacey. I'm with the District Attorney's Office and I'm wondering if you remember this woman. - No, I do not believe so. - Well, she came in here yesterday. She was with a man, an African-American man. He had a kind of a cowboy slicker. - Perhaps. I do not remember. - You remember. - This man, he bought a bottle Chivas Regal. - This is a liquor store. We sell beaucoup liquor. - Yeah. Expensive bottle of liquor to a homeless man, he paid you with a 50-dollar bill. - As I said, I do not remember. - You're lying. He's lying. - Wait-- - He's just lying! - No, hang on, just... Well, maybe your coworker would recall. - He does not speak English, and besides, he was not working yesterday, only I. I'm sorry, madam. - And that? - You are welcome to look, but the cameras have not worked since before I came here. Is there anything else I can do for you? - He's lying. He's lying his head off. - I don't know. These are for you. And I'm sorry for all your trouble and I thank you for your help. - Nobody cares. Nobody. To all of you, he's just a bum. But he used to be somebody, okay? So don't turn your nose up 'cause it could happen to you, okay? - Yes, ma'am, I know that. My husband, he used to work with Mr. Tucker. - Then why don't you help him? You could help him if you wanted to. - Here. - No, I don't want your lousy cigarettes. (somber music) - Any luck? - Maybe. - Theft from vehicles report? - Tucker's fiancee said that he bought the Scotch with $50 that he stole from a sports car. - Mary Beth, maybe you forgot, but what you were supposed to be doing was finding someone who saw him wear different clothes than the ones he was arrested in. - Well, the fiancee says he always wore the same coat. - Yeah and, of course, fiancees always tell the truth. - Everybody I talked to said the same thing: Chance Tucker always wears the same coat. - Oh, right, everybody. Bums whose brains are so pickled, they couldn't tell you what they were wearing when they were talking to you. - For a person who's been in-- (man chattering) Who's been in AA for eight years, Chris-- - Seven years and nine months. Who's counting? - Chance Tucker's girlfriend used to be a normal housewife with two kids and a husband until he ran off. You could have a little empathy, Chris. - I have a lot of empathy. She should go out and get herself a job. - And the kids, they're supposed to get a job too? All right, okay, I'm not gonna argue politics with you. I talked to the clerk in the liquor store, I'm pretty sure he's lying to me. - Mary Beth-- - And there's one more thing, Tucker's hand. There was no gunshot residue on his hands either. - So he wore gloves and he threw them away. - Pretty sophisticated thinking for a homeless alcoholic with pickled brains. We've arrested the wrong man here. I'm taking this to Feldberg. - No. No, do not take it to Feldberg, Mary Beth, please. Look, just give him the list of witnesses that you talked to, what they said, just the facts, no editorial. And also, please finish the list of offenders that he asked you to do. - I said that I would do that this weekend. This is more important, Chris. - Look, Mary Beth, there's some rumors going around that there's gonna be a cutback. And I don't think this is the time to be tilting at windmills. - A cutback? - And I've liked having you here. I don't wanna lose you now, but... I've gotten used to having you around again. Anyway, so please would you just promise me? Promise me you won't go to Feldberg and you'll have that list of the offenders for him on his desk on Monday? - You're gonna miss your plane, Chris. - You're so stubborn, Mary Beth, stop it. Will you just promise me? - Have a good time. I'll see you Monday. Go up to him myself. Cutback. - Harvey can't work yet. She has to support the whole family. - You did what you could, Christine. You warned her. I have an appointment with a realtor. She's gonna show us houses tomorrow. - But the hotel's romantic. Makes me feel like we're going away for dirty weekends or something. - You don't have to live there. - Maid service, big jacuzzi tubs, hot, sexy brunches in bed. Mm-mm. - Okay, okay. We'll wait. - Couldn't we go back and start now? - Two hours, okay? I promise. If you press the flesh a little bit, smile that charming smile, I'll get us outta there just as early as I can, okay? - This Washington wives business, it's a full-time profession. I don't know if I know how to do this. - You've been great so far. You'll be great tonight. (gentle jazz music) - Oh, you're James Burton's charming wife. - Well, I'm working on the charming part. (group laughs) - James says you're a district attorney. - Well, I'm assigned to the Manhattan DA's Office, but I'm still in the police department. - You mean you're not a lawyer? - Just a simple cop. - Really? - Mm. - So tell me, do you know any of the ones who are always beating up on minorities? (gentle jazz music) - So how you doing? - You'll find out. Next weekend, you're coming up to the Patrol Women's Endowment Dinner. - Ooh, sounds scintillating. - It is, I'm making a speech. And after tonight, you owe me big time. - Tonight is not over yet. (Christine chuckles) - A dreamer. - It's obscene, you know that? Richest country in the world and we have people so desperate they gotta kill for a warm coat or a couple of bucks. - I told you, I don't think Chance Tucker did kill Jaeger. - Oh, well, you're right about that. Society did it. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness! Lots of luck in 20th century America! If you don't have a flushing toilet or enough PE-- - Sweetheart, you're not supposed to work yourself up. - You know, he had a life, Mary Beth. He had a house and a life before he hurt his back, lost his job, his medical insurance. And all his money was spent on doctors and hospitals! - Sweetheart-- - The only reason he started drinking was because he couldn't afford painkillers anymore. The land of opportunity, huh? What is it, something like 30% of Americans, three paychecks away from being on the street! - Honey, we're not gonna be homeless, okay? What? Why are you stopping? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm great. Let's go back, I had enough. - What are you doing? I thought you gave that up 10 years ago. Why do you wanna get hooked again? - It happened. - [Christine] What, the devil made you do it? - I had this carton, don't ask me how, and Saturday, I don't know, things got tense between me and Harv and it happened. I was all damn perfect. - I thought everything was okay with him. - The doctor got him on a low-fat diet. Exercise, stress reduction, he hates it. - It's hard to change your whole life. - When it's life or death, Christine? You gave up drinking. - Yeah, well, we're all human, Mary Beth. You're the one who just had a cancer stick in her mouth. (toilet flushing) Give him time, Mary Beth. Probably okay, he's the best. - Christine, tell me the truth. Am I gonna get laid off? - I swear, I don't know. It's Feldberg's call. The truth? It's a pretty good chance. But I'm gonna do everything I can to help you. - Right. - Excuses, I want the printouts. I can't finish the stupid projection for the mayor's office till you get it to me! - I was right, Christine. The man from the liquor store is lying. That is a report of a car break-in exactly like Chance Tucker described. - Did you finish the code offenders' list? - I gave it to Feldberg this morning. I asked them at the precinct to forward any reports of thefts from sports cars in that neighborhood, and there it is, only three blocks away. - The guy says he lost $540, a video camera, one leather coat, two suits, a cellular phone. This thing goes on and on. And I thought Tucket only stole $50. - The guy is scamming his insurance agent. - So you say. - Tucker breaks in, he takes $50. Doesn't even cover the deductible. So this guy, Jameson, decides to turn it into a windfall. - Or it is a completely unrelated car burglary. - Read the report, Christine. I'm telling you, we got the wrong man. Meanwhile, I would like to go and interview the car owner. What is his name? Jameson. If that's okay with you, boss. - Mary Beth, this guy is not gonna cop to insurance fraud. And I'm sure that Feldberg has better things for you to do with your time. - Mr. Feldberg has better things for me to do than solve a murder and free an innocent man? - Fine. Great! it's your job I'm trying to protect, but hey, obviously, you know better. (door clacks) - See you tomorrow. (door thuds) (gentle piano music) (suspicious music) - Go, go. (locks clacking) - Excuse me. Your name Dupuis? You spoke to my associate, Mrs. Lacey, about Chance Tucker. - It's late, madam. - Yes, I won't keep you long, Mr. Dupuis. I just wanna ask you one question: Did you sell him the Scotch? - I already told the other lady, no. - I know what you told her, but what I wanna hear is the truth. - The truth? - Yeah. - The truth is I see Chance Tucker every day, trying to beg enough money for food to keep him alive and a bottle to keep him warm. At least, now, he'll be taken care of. - Mr. Dupuis, I'm not a very patient woman. One more time, did you sell Chance Tucker an expensive bottle of Scotch which he paid for with a 50-dollar bill? - All I can think is, if I could, I would help an innocent man. - You think Tucker's innocent? - I am saying I cannot help. - What are you afraid of, Immigration? What if I get Immigration to agree not to detain you if you testify? - In my experience, to be safe, it is best not to draw attention to oneself. - Fine, I'm just slap you with a subpoena. - Then I'll disappear. - Well, then, I'll have you thrown into protective custody. - Then I will testify in court to the same thing I told to your associate, that I remember nothing. (Christine chuckles) - Okay, Mr. Dupuis, you win. But just between the two of us, I need to know, is Chance guilty of murder? - As I said, if I could, I would help this innocent man. Now, goodnight, madam, and be careful. There are many undesirables in this neighborhood at night. (people chattering) - Lieutenant. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - Christine, you have to help me with this Chance Tucker thing. - Mary Beth, you already turned the information over to Feldberg. He says that the local precinct will look into it. - They already have a suspect. It's gonna end up at he bottom of the pile. Chris, I wanna do this with you. - He's already given you another assignment. - It's another list to compile. I will do it at night if you help me with this here. - Mary Beth, I went and I talked to the clerk at the liquor store. - When? - Last night. Thought it was worth another look. - And? - And he hinted that maybe Tucker was telling the truth. - You see? Now, you put that together with the theft from the sports car-- - Mary Beth, assuming it's even the same car. You can't prove anything. All you got is suspicions about one guy, and a wink and a nod from another. - Let me ask you something: What was your first instinct about this case? That the tenants in the co-op have a damn good motive, right? See, it's all too pat, Christine. It's like it's that movie, you know, the one, you know the one, with the... It's Spencer Tracy with the one arm, and he goes into this tiny, little town-- - "Bad Day at Black Rock." - Exactly. Now, I'm asking, if we were back at the 14th precinct, out on the street-- - Which we're not. And your job is on the line here. - And you weren't worried about my job, and this case came up in the normal rotation, what would you say about it then? - You know, I have very important things to do. The mayor is waiting for a projection from me and I have a speech to write which I am giving on Saturday. - What would you say, Chris? - I would say that we should talk to people at the co-op. - After Ira's throat operation, we tried to sell the co-op, but it fell through twice, all because of that Earl Yeager. Oh, we were very angry. - Yeah, everybody bought guns. - Six months ago, one of them went off accidentally in the apartment above us one night, scared the stuffing outta me. - She almost had a nervous breakdown. - Gingerbread. That's what sells real estate, now that that Earl Yeager is dead, that bald-headed ape. He killed the old shrubs by urinating on them. - Mrs. Glass, you are chaining that planter to the pole. - The homeless, they steal anything they can sell. And if it isn't the homeless, it's the crack addicts. That's why we wanna leave New York. - You think it'll be better in Fort Lauderdale. There are homeless everywhere. - Ira, we are going to Fort Lauderdale when we sell the co-op, and that's all there is to it! - Mr. Coster, did you have any special problems with Earl Yeager? - We all had our problems. - Mrs. Glass said you all bought guns. Did you buy a gun, Mr. Coster? - A gun? I can't own a gun. My wife, she died. - Well, we're very sorry to hear that, sir. - It was 10 years ago. But I was in a hospital, an institution, really, for a while. So a history of mental illness, post-depression, no gun permit. Probably just as well. He didn't do it, you know? - Who? You mean Chance Tucker? - He didn't kill Earl Yeager. - Mr. Coster, if you know something, it's important that you tell me. - Just a feeling. You've had that kinda feeling, haven't you? - Well, if Tucker didn't do it, then who did? Who killed him? (dog barks) - Well, it could have been a lot of people. I just know it wasn't Chance Tucker. - Excuse me, Lieutenant, this here is not the same park as the one where you found the body, is it? - No, no, that park's near the direction from the building on the far corner. - You don't walk your dog over there? It's so much closer. - A nice day like this, Jade likes the longer walk. Besides, I can use the exercise. (horn honking) - So what have we got? We got the Glasses who say they didn't hear or see anything. - We got Coster who said he was having dinner in his apartment that night. What is the name of that other tenant? Romeo something. - Romeo DeCarlo. He's a lawyer that lives in the penthouse. - Romeo DeCarlo, can you imagine, parents sticking you with a name like that? I'm getting a pimple? - Where? - Oh, I am. Look, there. - Where, I don't see anything. - There! It's right-- - Just at the neck, Christine. Oh, there it is. - Where? - Well, it's a little, I can hardly see it. - It's there. Jimmy's coming home this weekend and I got a face full of zits. - Chris, there comes a time in a woman's life when her skin-- - I don't, stop, I don't wanna hear that. Excuse me! Go away! - Here you go. - God bless you, lady. - Okay. - Mary Beth, you give him money like that, it merely reinforces his behavior. - My money, if I wanna give it away-- - Well, they only keep begging 'cause it works. - They only keep begging 'cause they're hungry. - It's a scam, Mary Beth. He's gonna go spend it on booze and drugs. - Yeah, sure, lot of them, yeah, but there's also a lot of hard-working, decent people who are down on their luck. - Well, fine, let them take the jobs we keep importing illegal aliens for. - Minimum wage or less. - There is no reason why anyone in this country should go hungry. - Fine, tell that to the president the next time you see him. - Mary Beth, I understand you're being sensitive about this particular subject because of the job situation and-- - I don't wanna talk about it, Christine. - I told you that I was... You do not have to worry about money. - Thank you, I don't wanna talk about it. - Mary Beth, why would-- - I want to do my job, Christine, and my job right now is to go and talk to Sunny Pay. - Out! Get out, you lazy good-for-nothing! - Hey, man! - No excuses! I told you, "Once more," and now, I tell you the last time. Out! - Yeah? Well, the hell with you and your stinking job! - Easy, take it easy. - Mr. Pay? - Yes, ladies? - District attorney's investigators, Mr. Pay. We need to talk to you about Earl Yeager. - Don't have time to talk. I just fire my lazy, good-for-nothing helper. - Yes, sir, we saw that. - Mr. Pay. Mr. Pay, if we could you just-- (table flap thuds) - When I came to this country, I work 18 hours a day. I sleep in back there until I saved enough money to bring my wife from Korea, find an apartment. Now, I cannot find a good helper. I still must work 15 more hours every day. I must wear this flak jacket to protect me from hoodlums. - Mr. Pay, Earl Yeager-- - That bastard! He scare my wife. She never leave the apartment alone. Never. What kind of country this? You let a crazy man out on the street! - Mr. Pay, please try and calm down. We have a few questions, that's all. (Mr. Pay speaking in foreign language) - I don't talk to police. They get everything backwards. Do you know what happened to me? I stand up to Yeager. I make him fight me. He break my arm. Who do your police arrest? You want to know? Me. They take me to court. You make me pay thousand dollars. - Mr. Pay, the precinct report said that you saw Earl Yeager the day he was killed. - I go home for lunch, I come back here, he yell at me. Both times, say he kill me. I call police. No one ever come. But that night, they find the body. They come see me, all right. They think I kill him. You police don't like Koreans. Then they find Chance Tucker. So better, blame black man, not Korean man. You know what I think? I think Chance Tucker is a hero. Give him medal, give him reward. It damn shame you put him in a jail! - These veggie burgers are pretty good, don't you think, Alice? - [Harvey] Legitimate tastes like sawdust. - I think this is tofu. - What's tofu? Don't tell me. You got any cheese? Maybe cheese will help. - Harv. - A little cheese isn't gonna kill me, Mary Beth. You talking to Feldberg about Chance Tucker tomorrow? - [Mary Beth] I'm working on it, okay, Harvey? - Is that that homeless man who killed the other homeless man? - Well, I don't think he did it, sweetheart. That's why I'm gonna talk to the boss. - I don't think anybody who is homeless doesn't deserve to be. - Alice Christine, that is not true. There's little children even-- - It's not a simple thing, pumpkin. - There's an expression, "There but for the grace of God, "go you or I." You know what that means? - I'm just saying what Jennifer's mom said on the way to school yesterday. - Well, I think that Jennifer's mom is a little short-sighted. So you and Jennifer's mom are walking to school every day? Is this the start of neighborhood scandal or something? - She doesn't walk, she drives me and Jennifer on her way to work every morning. - Harvey, that's how you said you getting your exercise. - Yeah. Well, I'll start again tomorrow. Okay? (somber music) - We'll keep trying things until we find something we like. - Recent surveys of Americans show the most pressing problem to the majority of citizens is the high incidence of crime. But who exactly is in jail? Us or them? If you look at the percentage of citizens too afraid to leave their homes and walk the streets at night or even in the daytime, I'd say it's us. (pen scratching) (buttons clicking) (phone beeping) (tone rings) Yes, James Burton's room, please. Oh. Okay, well, would you just tell him his wife called? Thank you. - Would you take it easy here, Chris? I can't drink coffee at home anymore and now you're hustling me outta that joint at eight minutes to eight in the morning. - Hey, this is your big project, Mary Beth, not mine. You wanna get it done, let's do it! - Fine, but am I correct in presuming there's more going on here than meets the eye? - You mean menopausal facts? - That is not from me. - Well, whoever did it, it is not funny! Now, may I suggest that we divvy up your list. I will take one half, you take the other. - Fine. I'll take the half she doesn't eat for breakfast. - He scared me. He said some really bad, nasty things to me. - I'm so sorry, Rebina. - We already went over this with the police that night. - I understand, it's just that sometimes we have to check. - I'm a physical coward, Mrs. Lacey. Since I was a boy, I've abhorred violence. So, yes, I bribed Earl Yeager to leave me alone. - The down jacket Yeager had, the one that was covering Chance Tucker when he was found? - Yeah, it was mine. He demanded it from me a few days before he was killed. - Now, about that night? - We didn't see anything. We watched TV all evening long. - First thing we knew about the murder was when the police came. And the last time that I saw Earl Yeager was that afternoon. - You said he threatened you? - I was just outside when he jumped out from between two cars, he grabbed my purse, took the $50 that I had, then he threw my wallet into the middle of traffic. - And did you ever call the police, Mr. Osmond? - Oh, please, Mrs. Lacey, the police response to this whole affair has been pathetic. But me complaining to the police? In my experience, most police have absolutely no use for a gay man in our society. (door clacks) - Sorry, excuse me for bothering you. Your door was ajar. - Oh. - Mr. Osmond, I'm Lieutenant Cagney-Burton. I was just talking to Mrs. Lewis across the hall. I just have one question that nobody seems to be able to answer and maybe you could help me. Chance Tucker is accused of killing Earl Yeager for, among other things, $50 which was found on his person. What nobody seems to be able to help me with is how Mr. Yeager got the $50 to begin with. - Well, I gave it to him, actually. He had threatened me that morning and he demanded money, so I gave him what I had, $50. (doorbell rings) Would you excuse me for a moment? - [Christine] Certainly. - Chris. - Alcina Lewis just volunteered that Yeager stole the money from her purse. - But Tucker said he took it from the car. - Mm-hm, I went and talked to the Glasses, they said they gave Yeager the money. Osmond says he gave Yeager the money. Well, somebody's slipping-- - [Romeo] Ladies. You must be Lieutenant Cagney-Burton, I believe. Mrs. Lacey. I'm Romeo DeCarlo, attorney-at-law. - Yes, sir, Mr. DeCarlo, you live in the penthouse and Earl Yeager vandalized your Mercedes? - Vandalized, that's a nice neutral word. How about trashed? How about demolished? He was a deranged lunatic. - Mr. DeCarlo-- - You've already got the lunatic's killer. Why are you harassing my neighbors? - We're merely continuing an investigation, Mr.-- - DeCarlo. - DeCarlo. - Fine. I'm acting as their attorney and I'm advising them not to talk to you. Roy, I suggest you say nothing to them. Absolutely nothing. - Why, what do you have to hide? - We've been through enough already. Five years of Earl Yeager's tyranny. Five years of police indifference and ineptitude. Have we not we suffered enough? Can you not just leave us in peace?! (horns honking) (people chattering) - You're staring at it. - What? - My zit. - You can barely notice it. - But you can notice. I haven't had pimples since I was 17 years old. - I don't know what you expect, Christine. You're not 17-- - I don't wanna hear about menopause. - Fine, I don't know what I'm talking about. I never do. - Hot flashes, insomnia, diminished libido, why don't they just take me out and shoot me? - It'll pass, Chris. Think we got enough for Feldberg now? - Unless a stockbroker testifies that Earl Yeager bought 150, $200 with AT&T the day he was killed, then Chance Tucker's innocent. And those tenants are framing him. - Come on. Mr. Feldberg must be done with his lunch by now. Let's track him down. - [Mr. Feldberg] The case is closed. He copped a plea. - [Christine] Well, he can't do that when he's innocent. - [Mr. Feldberg] Oh, no, not you too, Cagney. Don't either of you have any real work to do? - Mr. Feldberg, he is, Chance Tucker is innocent. - Look, he stood up in the court of law this morning and freely and voluntarily confessed and plead guilty to murdering Earl Yeager, and frankly, that's good enough for me. - So an innocent man goes to prison for the rest of his life? - Lacey, he says he did it. He was drunk at the time, so I let him plea to manslaughter which means he'll be out in five years, during which time, he'll get three meals a day and a warm place to sleep. And that's a hell of a lot better than he was doing out on the streets. - And it doesn't matter that he's not guilty, that the actual murderer is out there on the streets some place still? - Okay, fine. Who? If it's not Tucker, then who did it? - The tenants that Yeager was harassing, they did it. And they pinned it on Tucker. - The tenants? - Yeah. - What, all of them together? What is this, "Murder on the Orient Express"? Or maybe we could narrow it down a little bit. - We're not sure, but, basically, we have six suspects. - Oh. Great. One confessed killer is sufficient, thank you. Six suspects does me no good at all. Ladies, this case is closed. Oh, Lacey, I wanna see you in my office tomorrow. Set it up with my secretary when you get back. - Yes, sir. I'm gonna go get some air. - Could you kinda hurry it up a bit? I've got better things to do with my time than sitting here on Rikers. - Tucker's still at breakfast. We'll have him up for you in a minute. - He's at breakfast. I should be doing those projections for the mayor. I'll get some sensible shoes for the beat they're gonna have me walking. When do you see Feldberg? - 10:30. - You nervous? - What could he tell me I don't expect already? If he lays me off, I'll get another job, that's all. - You don't have to put on a good face for me, Mary Beth. - So how is James? When's he coming in? - Well, funny you should ask. I got home last night and he was there waiting for me. - [Mary Beth] Oh. - Yeah, we've been invited to the White House for dinner, Saturday night. - No. - Yeah. - [Mary Beth] That's fantastic, Christine. - I'm supposed to be giving a speech that night at the Patrol Women's Endowment Dinner. Remember? - You hate making speeches anyhow. What are you gonna wear? - I told him I couldn't go. - This is the White House, Chris, not some reservation at the Rainbow Room. - He knew I had this speech. And his whole attitude was "big deal." You know, big deal because all he cared about, of course, was his latest dabble in politics. And my career, well, I just get a little pat on the head. Thank you. - Christine, sometimes, in marriage, you have to bend a little, like a tree. - Well, I don't mind bending a little, like a tree. I just mind being twisted like a pretzel. It's not just the dinner. You know what he also wants me to do? He wants me to quit the force, move to Washington, and network. Do you love that, network with the Clinton people and lobby for a job with that administration! - That doesn't sound so terrible. - I didn't vote for these people, Mary Beth! Besides, presidents come and go, you know? What kind of security is that for me? - Your marriage, Christine, that's the security. - Well, you tell that to the 50% of wives in this country who get fired. - Lieutenant! (knocking) - What? - Lieutenant, ma'am, you can go in now. - He called you "ma'am." (door buzzing) Thank you. - Harvey Lacey. - You worked in construction with him about 10 years ago. Well, that's okay. I also saw your friend, Gloria. She says to tell you she's still living at the shelter and she's doing okay. - Gloria. You met her? That's good she's okay. You got a smoke? - Yeah. Mr. Tucker, do you remember being in court yesterday? You plead guilty to killing Earl Yeager? (Chance sighs) Did you kill him? - I guess. - What do you mean you guess? - Everybody says so, so I guess I did. - Do you really think you did? - I don't remember. When I'm drinking, there's a lot of stuff I don't remember. But old Mr. Jenkins, he lets me sweep up the bar in the morning. 10 bucks. He gave it to me in advance. Tell him... Oh, when I get one of those prison jobs, I'll send it back to him. - Chance, did you steal $50 from a car? - Now, who told you that? Did Gloria tell you that? - [Mary Beth] She's trying to help you. - I'm no thief, I swear it, but I needed a drink. It's all I could think of. And I saw this car with the window wide open, wallet on the seat, so I just took the 50 out. Listen, I'm sorry. If you can find out who it is, tell him I'll send him his money back to him. Only, it'll take a little longer. Do you think you could spare a few more of those smokes? - [Mary Beth] Okay. - Here, keep the pack. - [Mary Beth] So, what do we do now? - [Christine] You tell me. He said he had no one coerced him into pleading guilty. I don't think there is anything we can do. And what were you doing with cigarettes in your bag? - [Mary Beth] I told you I had a carton. - [Christine] You know how bad those are for anyone, much less someone who's had breast cancer, thank you. - I'm not smoking 'em. They're for interviews. - [Christine] I'll believe you, but thousands wouldn't. (people chattering) - It's nonsmoking in here. - I'm aware of that, thank you. Do you have the correct time? - A little before 10. - How little? - Four or five minutes, give or take. - So? Tell me, what did he say? - I went to his office at 10:30 and his secretary says that the meeting has been postponed to next week. I should call and reschedule. He's gonna lay me off, why can't he just do it? - Mary Beth, I shouldn't-- - I'm keep wondering what's gonna happen when I tell Harvey. - You haven't told him? - He's depressed enough. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. - I shouldn't have said anything to you, but Feldberg told me that he was gonna work the budget around so that it would be okay. And maybe we're worrying about nothing. Tell you what, why don't I buy you a nice lunch? - I'll tell you what I'd prefer. I'd prefer to go back to that co-op and we give it one more shot. - What are we gonna get we didn't get last time? - I don't know. - Yeah, okay, fine. - Mrs. Glass, all we want is a few words with you. - [Mrs. Glass] I'm sorry, but Mr. DeCarlo was very definite. We shouldn't talk with you. (speaker clicks) - So, the offer for lunch is still open. Ah, Mr. DeCarlo. I see someone here must have called you. You trained them very well. No one in the building will talk to us unless you're present. - Call me Romeo. - Right. - Okay, I'm gonna tell you again for the record. No one here saw anything that night, no one heard anything, not until the police came and harassed Mr. Pay. - Nobody's harassing anybody, Mr. DeCarlo. - No? What would you call it when you've already got a confessed killer awaiting sentencing? - I'd call it looking into other possibilities. - You're harassing us! We, the people, come together as a society. We pay you police for protection so we can trade vigilantism for the rule of law. When that social contract breaks down, then we, as individuals, have the right to protect ourselves. - I'm not sure I understand you. Are you saying you have the right to murder somebody? - Say that again, I'll sue you for slander. Chance Tucker is a confessed killer. No one in this building saw or heard anything that night. End of discussion. Lieutenant, I was thinking you and I could get together in a more conducive environment? - Say that again, and I'll sue you for slander. - Good day, Mr. DeCarlo. - Come on, Lieutenant! I'll show you why my mama named me Romeo! - Maybe she was hoping you'd poison yourself! (Romeo chuckles) - One of those people killed Earl Yeager. One of those nice, normal people murdered another human being in cold blood, and they framed another one without giving it another thought. Harv, what would you say if I just gave it up? - Chance Tucker didn't do it, Mary Beth, you can't give up on him. - No, I don't mean that. I mean, this whole... This investigator thing, it gets me so sad sometimes, Harv. Maybe I should be doing something else. - That's great. How are we gonna get by? - We'd get by. - How?! I can't work, nobody's gonna hire me, and who's gonna give you a job that pays like this? - Honey, I don't wanna-- (door slams) Hey, sweetheart. - [Alice] Hi, Mommy. - Come here, give me some, sugar. How was school? - [Alice] It was okay. What's for dinner? - I got a chicken in the oven. - Did you remember to take the skin off? - I'll take it off later. - Harvey, you're supposed to take the skin off first so that... Okay. Whatever. It's not a big deal. Oh, I found this cassette. Guided Meditation for Stress Reduction. I thought maybe we could do it together. Lord knows I could use it too. - Alice is hungry, I'm gonna get the dinner. - Well, okay, after dinner. I mean, where do you usually meditate, Harv, on the floor, in your chair? You want a little pillow under you, Mr. Lacey? - The Knicks are on TV tonight. We'll do this another time, okay? - Okay. (people chattering) - Hi. - Hello. - I'm Martha Cruickshank and this is Bob Hilliard. - How do you do? - [Martha] We're with the mayor's office. - Oh, it's nice to meet you. I'm Christine Cagney-Burton. - Yes, we know who you are. May I get you a drink? - Please, a club soda. - Scotch, rocks, white wine, and a club soda, please. - We were asked to talk to you. - Really? By whom? - There are rumors that you have ambitions to become police commissioner, Lieutenant. - Well, I honestly hadn't thought about it in a long time. - Since getting married, you mean? Are you going to be moving to Washington with your husband? - We don't mean to be intrusive, but nobody wants to back a horse who's planning on bolting the barn. - Oh, of course, no, please, I want you to know, no, New York is my home. Washington's just a weekend thing. Thank you. And I'm very open to anything that you have in mind. - Well, then, here's to the future, Lieutenant, whatever it may bring. - I'll drink to that. (glasses clinking) - That's not a bad turnout. You okay, honey? - Yeah, I'm okay, I just feel stuffed in this suit. - You look good, Harvey. You took off a few pounds since the last time you wore it. - Did you wanna remind me of that, Mary Beth? Last time I wore this suit, I nearly died in it. - You're doing great, Harv. Doctor's gonna be very happy with you, your next visit. - The doctor's gonna say exactly what he always says. - [Mary Beth] Harv, I'm gonna go to the ladies' room. - [Christine] I thought you'd stopped. - Don't start with me, please. - What are you so temperamental for? Oh, wait, I know, menopause. (Christine chuckles) - Oh, that's funny, Christine. - Yeah. - If you're starting your speech with a joke, I hope it's that one. Or you could try this one: They've set sentencing for Chance Tucker next Wednesday. - Mary Beth, we have done everything humanly possible. Now, did you know that according to a national study, there are more people afraid of public speaking than they are afraid of dying? I was gonna practice my words in here, but you smoked the place up. - Pardon me. - [Christine] It's all right. - Is James here? - Oh, that's funny. Oh, well, I should be out there shmoozing, anyway. (spray hissing) (people chattering) - And she says to me, "Trees are nature, right?" I said, "Yeah," oh, thank you. I said, "Yeah, trees," oh, excuse me, but he wanted the fish, not the roast beef. - I'll eat the beef, it looks good. Thank you. - Well, if you cut the fat off, I suppose you could have a couple of bites. - Oh, would you care for a butter and sour cream and chives sweet potato? - No butter, no sour cream. The chives are okay-- - I'll take the whole schmear. Thank you. - Harv, what are you doing? You know better than this. - Mary Beth, it's one night. - Harvey, don't eat that. (table thuds) (tableware clattering) - Fine, I won't. - Pardon me. Excuse me. (door clicks) Did you get the babysitter home okay? - Of course, I got the babysitter home all right. You don't have to grill me about everything. - Harvey, I didn't mean it like that. You wouldn't talk to me in the car, you go raging outta Christine's party. I don't understand what's going on with you. - You wanna know what's going on, Mary Beth? Is that what you want? I'll tell you, Mary Beth, what's going on is you're always on my back. "Do this, don't do that. "Eat this, don't eat that." - Harvey, I'm trying to-- - You treat me like a three-year-old for God's sake. And you keep pushing to make love to you. I can't. - [Mary Beth] I don't mean to push. - How can I make love to you when you treat me like you're my mother? - [Mary Beth] I love you, Harvey, I want you to take care of yourself. I want you to live forever. - Why? I can't work. I can't fool around. I can't even eat, damn it! Who the hell wants to live like this?! - Oh, come on, sweetheart, it's not so bad. - The hell it's not! I used to have a life. This isn't a life, this is just a slower way of dying. I feel so damn worthless lying there, sponging off you. I mean, the only way I'm worth anything to anybody is dead for the damn insurance money. - It's late, you're tired. - [Harvey] Now, who doesn't wanna talk? - [Mary Beth] We'll talk in the morning, Harvey. You need your sleep, and you'll feel better in the morning. (door thuds) - Damn it, Mary Beth, stop telling me what I'm feeling! I can feel any damn thing I want! What I don't feel like is living this half a life. I'd just as soon get it over with! I really would, I'd rather be dead! - Here. Here, here's the pills that the doctor gave me when I couldn't sleep worrying about you! We'll order in pizza, pepperoni, extra cheese. You can wash the whole thing down with a six-pack of beer. Go ahead, take it. Take the whole thing, take the whole damn bottle. - What are you talking about? - You won't touch me, you don't want me! You don't wanna get better! You wanna die? Go ahead and do it, get it over with. I'm gonna sleep on the sofa. (somber music) (Alice crying) (door clicks) Morning, sunshine. (door thuds) Ally? (knocking) Honey? (doorbell rings) - Hi. I couldn't get you on the phone. - [Mary Beth] I wasn't answering the phone. - Probably explains it. Some friend you are, walking out before my speech. Fortunately, I was brilliant. Even without your support. (door thuds) I brought Sunday breakfast. - Maybe later, thanks. Don't give me that look. - Okay. (Christine groans) What a wonderful morning. I hear there may be rain by this evening. Rain's nice, don't you think? - I apologize for leaving early. We were fighting. - I could tell. So are you okay? - Other than my husband is locked in the bedroom not talking to me and I'm about to lose my job and doing damnedest here to catch lung cancer? - Yeah, well, other than that. - He won't take care of himself and he hates me for nagging at him. - Nobody could make me stop drinking, not till I said so. I can't make you stop smoking. And you can't make Harvey do something he doesn't wanna do, no matter how much you love him. - Oh, God, Christine. Last night, I tried to shock him out of it. And now, I'm scared that he's called my bluff. - You know, Mary Beth, I really hate people who use those AA buzzwords, I do, but you really have to stop manipulating. You have to just turn it over. You have to love Harvey enough to stop controlling him. You've just put one of those out! - See? It's impossible. You care about somebody, it's impossible to watch them hurting themself. - Right. - He won't come near me, Chris. We haven't made love, nothing, ever since he... - He's probably afraid of having another heart attack. - Well, the doctor tells him not to be, that it's good for the heart muscle. - Well, the doctor didn't almost die. So just give him more time, that's all. - Yeah, all right. I hope so. Did you talk to James? - No. - Christine. - You know, I thought he'd show up last night, surprise me. - Call him, Chris. Don't let pride stand in your way. Work is great, but it doesn't keep you warm at night. Your marriage is the most important thing, don't let anything come in front of that. - Yeah, that's what they tell us, ever since we were little girls. And no matter how happy you are doing anything else, if you don't have a solid marriage, you have nothing. - You go through what I have with Harv, where every day, God forbid, you don't know if you're gonna lose him, puts things into perspective, Christine. Talk to him. Couldn't hurt anything. See if there's some way to work stuff out. I'm not fooling here, Christine. If you don't, you'll end up sorry, believe me. - I want it to work out. Okay. Maybe I should surprise him. I could catch the next shuttle. - [Mary Beth] Good. - I could go home, I could wash, I could put on something fabulous. - That's good. - Something in ivory. - Perfect. - I could do that. Yeah. Do you mind? - I love it. - [Christine] Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah. - [Christine] Me too. Give my bagels to Harvey. Taxi! (somber music) (knocking) - [Alice] Daddy? Daddy? - [Harvey] Yes, pumpkin? - [Alice] Can I come in, Daddy? - [Harvey] Oh. What's up, pumpkin? Why such a sad face? - [Alice] Are you and Mommy getting a divorce? - [Harvey] Oh. No, baby. We're just having a few problems, but it's no big deal. We love each other. And we love you very much. What, baby? - [Alice] Please don't die, Daddy. Please. - Oh, baby. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die, sweetheart. - Welcome to the Hay-Adams Hotel. - [Woman] Thank you. - Hi, Charlie! Oh, thank you. (lock clacking) Honey, I'm home! - [James] Chris. - Room service. (door clicks) - Christine, please. - I'm sorry. Excuse me. - [James] Christine. (somber music) - [Taxi Driver] Where to, ma'am? - Airport, please. - How long have you been here? - A few hours. Come on, let's go. - A few hours? Wait, wait, wait, it's not yet 8:00 a.m. I just wanna sit for a second, have a cup of coffee. - There's been a discrepancy in the dispatch records. The night that Earl Yeager was murdered, uniforms were dispatched to the park at exactly 11:14 which, according to this, is six minutes before I stumbled on the body and called 911. - Maybe somebody's watch was off. - Maybe not. Come on, you can drink that in the car. - The car. So, you wanna tell me? How'd it go? Was James surprised? - [Christine] Oh, damn it, I'm spritzing again. - Happens to me too, Christine, every time I drink too much coffee. - Thank you for your discretion. Even forgot to put my earrings on this morning. Tell you, Mary Beth, I think maybe I am in menopause. - It happens, in 51.2% of the population. - Yeah, well, death happens to 100%. (Mary Beth laughs) (both laughing) Oh, you know, if I'm lucky, all my hormones will shut down at once, then I wouldn't have to think about men anymore. - Come on, what happened? - Nothing. Nothing I shouldn't have seen coming. So tell me about Harv. How's Harv? - Oh, he's alive. (both laughing) (elevator bell rings) - Yes, here it is. A call came in through the operator at 11:14 and I dispatched uniforms. Your call, Lieutenant, came in on the 911 line and was recorded at 11:20. - Do you have a tape of that first call? - The 911 call is automatically recorded and saved. A call that comes through the operator, it doesn't work that way. - [Mary Beth] Do you remember the call? - Are you kidding? If I'd lived in Podunk, maybe, but, here in New York, all I have is what's on the log. - Well, you did write down it's a male voice. - Was there anything distinctive about the voice? Like amplified with a voice box or accented or maybe a little effeminate? - I would have noted anything distinctive like that. This was just your ordinary garden variety male voice. - [Mary Beth] Well, that seems to rule out Sunny Pay, Roy Osmond, Ira Glass. There's no way wouldn't have noticed how they talk. - [Christine] Well, that leads us with Coster and DeCarlo. Unless, of course, it's one of the other four million men in the naked city. - Aw, come on, Chris, you and I both know that it's somebody in that co-op. - [Christine] I know it. - They called in the murder so the police could hustle over there and pick up Chance Tucker with their carefully planted evidence. - Well, I vote for DeCarlo. He's a criminal lawyer. He'd know to go through the operator. If anybody knew how to keep his voice from being recorded, it's him. - [Man] Excuse me, you got any spare change? - Excuse me! This is a police station for God's sake! Mary Beth, don't do that! You're not helping him. He's just gonna go get a bottle. - Get a hot meal, okay? - [Man] Thank you, God bless you. - They're human beings, Christine. Don't you have any compassion? - No, I don't have any compassion. I'm angry. Angry because they've become so obnoxious I don't even see them as human anymore. And then I get to be mad at myself for being so heartless. - Gee, I think it's easier just to give 'em a buck. - [Man] Okay, you got your ticket? - Yeah, ladies, may I help you? - We'd like see any records you have on Mr. Romeo DeCarlo's car. - Uh-huh, did he say it was okay? - Just give us the damn records. - Please. Otherwise, we'll have to get a subpoena. Make us go through that, and we'll have to contact the IRS, who'll wanna know all about your accounting procedures and the INS is gonna wanna know all about your hiring practices and on and on-- - Ladies, ladies, please. It's a citizen's duty to cooperate with the NYPD. - Parked his car at exactly 10:38 that night. Five minutes to walk that way to the park and the co-op. - That's perfect time to kill Earl Yeager. - Wait a minute. You know what that doorway is? - [Mary Beth] What? - That's the doorway they found Chance Tucker sleeping in. - So DeCarlo sees him on the way home. - And sees he's unconscious. (Christine chuckles) Very convenient for a frame up, don't you think? Oh, Romeo. Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? - He's got an office on West 76th. - [Alice] Reached the number you have dialed. Leave a message. (tone beeps) - Harvey? Harv, are you there? Pick up if you're there, Harv. Okay, I hope if you're not there, that you're out walking. I didn't mean to do that, I wasn't gonna, I'm sorry. Honey, I'm sorry to go mother henning you. I don't wanna be your mother. I wanna... Well, damn it, Harvey, what am I supposed to do? I love you. Go take a walk. Thanks. (door clicks) Sorry. - I was just telling your partner here that, obviously, the garage records are mistaken. - Obviously, happens all the time. - I was having dinner with Paul Coster. Anyone gets on a witness stand, tries to say otherwise, I'll spin 'em around so hard, he won't know whether he's coming or going. - All in the pursuit of truth and justice, no doubt. - Truth? Truth is I don't give a crying crap about bringing Earl Yeager's killer to so-called justice. Chance Tucker was a hero in my book. Now, if you'll excuse me, I bill my time at 2.50 an hour. This inane conversation has already cost me 75 bucks. We can still-- - Not a chance. - Hey! Anybody home? (button clicks) (tone beeps) Harvey, are you there? Harv, pick up the-- (button clicks) (answering machine squealing) (button clicks) I love you. Go take a walk. (tone beeps) - [Alice] Hi, Mom, I'm at Jennifer's. Daddy says I can sleep over if it's okay with you. Call back. (tone beeping) - Harvey? Honey?

And I don't wanna miss any day I could have with you or with our family. But it's gotta cut both ways, Mary Beth.

I know you told me this isn't the park where you walk your dog, that you always go over to York Avenue, but my partner pointed out that this isn't human nature, that this park is so much closer, especially on a chilly night like that. - [Paul] Jade, come on, come on. - [Christine] So if you were here on the night that Yeager was killed, you must have seen his body. - Come on, Jade, you know how to heel. They say that dogs don't respect you unless you're stern with them. Somehow, I can never bring myself to yell at her. - I know the problem. When you were in the park, you saw Romeo DeCarlo kill Earl Yeager, didn't you? - No. - You lied about having dinner together to cover for him, didn't you? - I'm not covering for him. - Mr. Coster, I don't get why you're doing this. You must be a nice person and a good friend, but I am damn sure a selfish jerk like DeCarlo would never lie to protect you. - Romeo DeCarlo did not kill Earl Yeager. I'm telling you the truth. If you don't wanna do your business, we're going home. Come on. Heel. - Okay, so the Glasses' apartment is here, across from them is Alcina Lewis with her daughter. - Mary Beth, why don't you call personnel? Find out how much severance pay they're gonna give you if they lay you off. - I already did. I'm on probation, no severance. Osmond is here and across the hall from him, Paul Coster. - No, that isn't right. That puts Coster in the apartment over the Glass couple. - Well, that's where he lives, Christine, 3B. Except that Mrs. Glass said that-- - That a gun went off in the apartment above hers six months ago. And Coster says that he's never owned a gun. - Good, Christine. Very good. - Charlie Chan. - [Romeo] I'd like it to go on the record Mr. Coster is speaking to you over my objections. - Fair enough. Mr. Coster, I'd like to see your gun, please. (dog barks) - Oh, gee whiz. (Mary Beth laughs) - Jade. - I'm sorry. - Jade. - No, that's okay. Could I use your kitchen? - Of course, of course. - Pardon me. - Jade, Jade. - [Romeo] I'm sorry, Lieutenant Cagney, you don't understand, under the New York State law, it's illegal for Paul to own a gun. - Yeah, we spoke to the officer who responded to the shots fired call by Mrs. Glass downstairs. He said it was an accident, that you were cleaning your gun. He also said you seemed like a nice guy, so rather than arrest you, he gave you a warning. Told you to get your gun registered. - All right, so Paul had an unregistered gun, but he doesn't have it anymore. It was stolen. - Really? So you reported it? - No, I advised him not to, being it was illegal. - You know, it's funny, you're such an obnoxious character, DeCarlo. It never occurred to us that this dinner alibi cuts both ways. Mr. Coster here could be our shooter, not you. - You have no evidence connecting either one of us to any murder. - Pardon me, Lieutenant. There's something you might wanna look at in here. - [Christine] Excuse me a moment. - [Mary Beth] It's right there. - Wow! Whoever you hired to patch this should be ashamed of themself for doing such a sloppy job. - There's a bullet in there, isn't there, Mr. Coster? That's human nature, just leave it in there, putty it over. - I'm betting it'll match the slug taken out of Earl Yeager's chest. - I have not seen a search warrant. You don't have a search-- - Coster! Coster! (dog barking) - Out of the way, dog! - Where are the stairs? - Straight ahead. (thrilling music) - [Christine] You go down. I'll go up. - [Romeo] Paul, let me talk to you! - Coster! (tense music) Paul. - Please. I'm so ashamed! - Paul. Paul, please come down. Come down and talk to me, all right? - I can't live with it! I can't! - [Christine] Paul, tell me what happened. - You know what happened. I killed him. - Paul, it's okay. I'm sure you had a very good reason. - He was gonna hurt Jade. He said he was hungry. I told him I didn't have any money. He said he didn't want money. What he wanted was my dog. He was gonna eat my dog! Then he started to laugh. I got so angry, I was crazy. I didn't know what to say. I couldn't do anything. And then he lunged for Jade. And then something happened, I just snapped. So I reached in my jacket and I took out my gun, and I shot him. - Did DeCarlo see you? - Don't say anything more, Paul. - I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I don't want anybody to get into any trouble. (horn honking) (Paul yelps) - Paul, no! - No! No, no! - [Paul] I don't wanna die. Oh, God, I don't wanna die! (Paul sobbing) - [Christine] Paul, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put handcuffs on you. - [Romeo] Can't you just skip it? - Get out of my face, DeCarlo! - He's got a brain tumor! For God's sakes, he's got maybe six months to live! (somber music) - Who's gonna take care of Jade? Who's gonna take care of my poor dog? (Paul sobbing) - Oh, this is first rate. I've got a murderer with a terminal disease, and obstruction of justice indictments for a half dozen Good Samaritan neighbors who were only trying to help out a dying friend. Well, you've done a hell of a job, ladies. The juries will cry their eyes out and there isn't a conviction in the whole batch. - With due respect, Mr. Feldberg, we freed an innocent man. - Oh, right, right, I forgot. Who's gonna be let out onto the streets and has no place to go. Another victory. You know what? Go, take this garbage out of my office, give it to one of the junior ADAs to prosecute 'cause I don't even wanna look at it. - Mr. Feldberg. Mr. Feldberg-- - Oh, wait a minute, I've just had an idea. Put that on McKinnery's desk. He introduced me to my ex-wife. I owe that momser one. - Mr. Feldberg, there's something I need to know. Am I gonna be laid off? - Thank you, Cagney. Come back and see me later this afternoon. We'll know more then, okay? Betty, yeah. When did he call? Go, go, go. No, not you, Betty. Well, can you get him back? Try to ring him right now. I need to talk to him. - If I'm gonna get fired, there's something I wanna do first. - What? Come on, Mr. Pay, when we interviewed you, you said Chance Tucker deserved a medal. - It's different. Doesn't mean I give him job. - Have you found anybody to replace the man you fired? - He never could do it, no way. - Excuse me, sir, but I think I can. When I'm not drinking, I'm an excellent worker. And when I am, well, I'm still fair. - What do have to lose? Minimum wage to start. He can sleep in the back, just like you did when you first came here. - That door needs work. If you want, I can fix it. - This man used to work construction with my husband. 15 bucks an hour. If he's even half as good as he used to be, you got yourself a big bargain. - You could fix it? Okay. - He said okay. Did you hear him say okay? - [Christine] He did. - Okay. - You know, if he stays sober, gets himself back working, maybe him and Gloria will be able to get married. (Christine chuckles) - Yeah. The blushing bride and the bashful groom. A cardboard box and a white picket fence, and they all lived happily ever after. - Well, you don't have to be so cynical. It happens. - Excuse me, ladies, but could you spare some change for a hungry man? - Here, I'm not hungry. Come on, Mary Beth, we gotta get back. - Listen, I'm sorry, I liked to. Normally, I would, but I'm probably losing my job today. - [Man] That's okay. Bless you, anyway. - Here. - [Man] God bless you, ma'am. You're a good person. - Thanks. Not one word. I've got work to do, I don't wanna talk to you. - [James] Now, I've come all the way from Washington, so you'll damn well talk to me. - You son of a bitch. - Chris. - It's all right, Mary Beth. I'll talk to you inside in just a minute. - If you'd just come down to the White House dinner, none of this would have happened. - Oh, it's my fault? You can't keep your fly zipped, so it's my fault. - You were never gonna move down to Washington. I didn't mean enough to you for you to inconvenience yourself. - You know, Jimmy, you're even less attractive as a victim than you are as an adulterer. - You know, most women would have been thrilled to support a career move like this. Huh, but not Christine Cagney. - I see. You mean real women know all about how to be a doormat. - Don't give me all that feminist crap. I'm talking about our marriage here. - Well, excuse me, Mr. Clinton Bigshot. It's just so super to hear you talk about the holy state of marriage. - Just answer one question for me: Why did you say yes? Why did you marry me? - What are you, a glutton for punishment? - [James] I'm curious. (somber music) - Because I thought I was in love with you. Silly me. - We can do this. Give us a break. I love you, we're good together. - Cut the blarney, Jimmy. - [James] I mean it. - We're just not so good in the sack, is that it? - Lately not, so you've noticed. - Go to hell. - [James] Are you saying you don't love me anymore? - I don't know. If I'm not there next weekend, who'll be in bed with you then? Command appearance at Feldberg's. - [Mary Beth] Are you okay? - I'm fine. (people chattering) - [Mary Beth] Is he here? (people applauding) - What's going on? - It's Bernie's celebration. - Bern! Is it your birthday? - No, I'm taking an early retirement. They had to cut somebody and they've made me an offer I could not refuse. - All right, Bernie! Way to go! - Wow! - Mary Beth, have some champagne. - Yes, please, and congratulations. Good luck with retirement. - You better believe it. (Bernie chuckles) - Oh, that's just great. - [Mary Beth] Oh, Mr. Feldberg. - You lucked out. - Yeah. You won't be sorry, sir. - I'm not sorry. - Well, listen, here is to your happiness. You're getting out of here. (glasses clinking) And here's to your happiness. (glasses clinking) You're staying here. (concerned music) - Christine. - It's one drink. It's not gonna do anything, Mary Beth. See, I'm putting my glass on the table and, now, I'm gonna go home. And congratulations, my partner. - [Mary Beth] Chris! Christine, stop! - I don't wanna talk about it. - What did he do? What happened? - Nothing. This is not a tragedy. Some people just aren't cut out for the white picket fence. - Okay, you're coming home with me. You don't wanna be alone, Chris. - That's where you're wrong, Mary Beth. That's exactly what I want. (gentle music) - [Mary Beth] See you tomorrow? - [Christine] See you tomorrow. (lively music) (gentle music) (Multicom Jingle)
