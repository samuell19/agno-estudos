"Truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares an original affinity with freedom." What is all of this? A bus? A plane? A helicopter? Fuck, people. - Shit, there's someone's leg. See that? - It's a woman. A woman. Don't look. Don't look. What the hell was that? Was it a female pilot or what? Shit, I don't understand any of this. Yesterday, disregarding all the rules of war... they carried out a provocative terrorist attack on a civilian plane a regular plane that was on the way from Amsterdam to Malaysia. I'm asking all of you to step aside, behind that bus. What are you filming? Either you step away, or I will talk to you in a different way. BELLINGCAT I live on the outskirts of Berlin, in a terraced house. I live here with my daughter. I'm a single parent and she's severely handicapped which is why it's not possible for me to take on a job away from home. I mainly work from my home and thus have time for Bellingcat. The problem at the time was that, on the Russian side we had discovered a convoy with Buk rocket launchers that could be seen on several videos. We could locate this convoy, as it was moving from its base in Kursk to the Ukrainian border. Secondly, we received pictures of a Buk rocket launcher in Donetsk. The question was then whether there was a link between this convoy and that Buk rocket launcher in Donetsk. One Buk rocket launcher in the Russian convoy stood out right away you can see it here, where the numbers or digits are partly illegible and painted over. When you see these Buks for the first time, they all look similar, but just as with cars, they get dented and scratched, and so on, and they then become unique. The same goes for a Buk rocket launcher. This software constructs a 3D model based on the video images. This model can then be used. to place yourself in this environment through the use of virtual reality. and see everything in 3D. I was born in East Berlin and I considered everything normal. What work did I do in the DDR? Everything? During the last ten years, before the Wall came down I did office work for the East German secret service. I did analytical work there. I evaluated and collated information. Looking back, what I found most oppressive was that you couldn't discuss your work with anyone. The secret service wanted to know what people thought about the state. They wanted to know people's attitudes. That was their main task. What Bellingcat does, has nothing to do with that. We want to know what events have taken place. What has happened in crisis areas, where reporters can't go. And we want to make it public, and not keep it secret. That is the big difference. Suppose I place my laptop here. That way I can show the others what my office looks like today. During the past year, I've been in a different country every week for Bellingcat. Bellingcat's digital walls Can be set up anywhere whether it's here on this hotel roof in Amman or in the jungle of Kenya, or at a very large lake in Kyrgyzstan. It can be done anywhere, and that's pretty cool. Many Bellingcat members have a family, a wife and children which makes it more difficult to make long journeys to places like Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon Kyrgyzstan or Colombia. There has been an enormous information revolution. This war of information and access to it have brought about great changes. Take the most recent Gaza War as an example. The Israeli army had neat infographics, showing where they had bombed. On the opposite side there were many people on the Gaza Strip who had phones and Internet connections and in a way had their own CNN in their hands. They told us what was happening, that bombs were dropping and people dying. It has set many things in motion. The monopoly on information is shifting. That's why I think that the research method we're using to verify and analyse all those materials as if they're pieces of a puzzle becomes increasingly important, because the more people do it the more facts will be uncovered. Right now, I'm in a very large resort near the Dead Sea, in Jordan. I'm here for the tenth annual conference of ARIJ which is a network of investigative journalists throughout the Arabic-speaking world. I've been invited to do a workshop and a presentation about the work we do. That's really cool because there are a lot of people here I think it's the next one. A lot of people from the Middle East, from Yemen to Libya, from Egypt to Iraq. Good morning, my name is Christiaan Triebert from the Netherlands. I don't speak Arabic. I hope to be able to speak it in the future. But as for now... On 30 October 2016, at 4:11 p.m. this is the first tweet I can find about a car bomb in Iraq. It often goes like this. There's a link to Facebook. And then more people see it, it makes the news. People talk about it, a car bomb that resulted in the death of 13 victims. We see, for example, Reuters picking this up. Reuters says: If something is on the wire, Reuters, Associated Press the international media will pick it up. Here we have a New York Times article: It's a solid story. We have medical sources, IS claimed the attack. International journalists have been to the location and seen there has been a car bomb. There's still an exhaust lying there. People are still looking at it. This shows how important, but also difficult, fact checking is. A day later this suddenly appeared on the internet. So, this car explodes and there's no one nearby. Now look at what happens. These people are now taken away from the place where that car bomb exploded. Maybe they're even taken to the hospital. It's bizarre. I spent days working on this. Imagine doing that for every car bomb. This is something within journalism for which there is no time. I fully understand it has to go on the wire right away. It is reported in Baghdad and so you want it on the news or at least, you want to show it happened. It's worthwhile to dig some further and ask yourself: What is this? Bellingcat has blamed Russia many times for bombing Syrian civilians although this was officially denied by our Ministry of Defense. This way Higgins, armchair general and kitchen expert on everything the former video gamer is using Google Earth to hand out advice of cosmic importance. In 2015, there was an anonymous e-mail to all those I work with, my business partners, so to say. And this e-mail stated that I was lying and cheating. I was said to have financial problems and many other things that weren't true. When you're confronted with such a thing... I was shocked. At the same time, I don't worry about my safety. I don't think they'll go that far. It would be useless. Bellingcat is now so big that it doesn't matter if I'm involved or not. Australian Federal Police Commander - Hello. - Yes, good morning. - Andrey Ivanovich. - Hello, Fyodor Nikolayevich, - It's Nikolay Fyodorovich. Hi there. - Nice to hear you. - What is your profession at this moment? - I'm a journalist. A journalist? For which organisation? Right now, it's for the military channel 'The Star'. - I don't get it. - For the military channel 'The Star'. Channel 'The Star'. I see. - I'm in Moscow at the moment. - In Moscow. I understand. - Do you have your professional ID card? - Of course. This conversation bears a full set of characteristics. I believe the length and spacing are very good. - The spacing is 2. - That's good. - It's highly probable that it's his voice. - Spacing is two. No, of course it wasn't. We're working on a big investigation into Mahmoud al-Werfalli. a Libyan commander. They say things as if they are the best of creatures but they are passing right through the Islam like an arrow. Werfalli is accused by the ICC of extrajudicial killings in and around the city of Benghazi in Libya. - God is greater. - He who deceived you, has killed you. - Satan had deceived him. - What a disaster. God is greater. - He who deceived you, has killed you. - A crusader. Werfalli mostly fights in and around Benghazi where he is fighting jihadist groups. He is known for having killed many jihadist fighters. That's the reason he is wanted by the ICC in The Hague. It's about seven specific incidents in which he orders or performs the execution of persons without being preceded by any legal process. On 15 August 2017 the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued a warrant for his arrest. It's really bizarre. The arrest warrant was issued by the ICC in August 2017. There was an immediate reply from the Libyan National Army: We'll make sure he's taken into custody and will investigate what has happened. That didn't happen. In fact, activists reported he was involved with incidents. This went on for weeks and then months. It was difficult to verify, many unverified messages until, at one point, he executed another ten men on video. You see him with a rifle in his left hand, shooting those people one by one. If Werfalli does get arrested, he'll be the first person we have investigated who would then be brought to justice. We're starting to get worried about Timmi. It happens regularly that some team members aren't on Slack because they're busy, and Timmi makes lots of visualisations, of course. But, we haven't heard from him in a long time, and we can't reach him. And if even Eliot gets worried... I've tried to call him with Hadi. He's not answering his phone. So, that certainly is... The reason the Boeing crashed in Ukraine could've been a rocket and gunfire from an Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet. An anonymous source from Russian aviation told Interfax that the Ukrainian missiles may have been meant for Vladimir Putin's plane. The Russian Air Force One has crossed with the Malaysian Boeing at one point The JIT has carefully examined all images from 17 and 18 July 2014 showing the Buk-TELAR and has concluded that this Buk-TELAR has many unique characteristics. After extensive and labour-intensive research, involving many Buk-TELARs The JIT has come to the conclusion that the Buk-TELAR that shot down flight MH17 belongs to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade also known as the 53rd Kursk Brigade of the Russian Federation. The JIT conducts its own independent investigation and the conclusion we draw from that investigation must be based on legitimate and convincing evidence that can stand up in a court room. We noticed Bellingcat from the very start of our investigation. We couldn't visit the crime scene but in the first days tapped conversations appeared on the Internet. Normally, civilians don't know about this, but they were out on the Internet. There were images there, so the Internet was very important from the very start. At first, we were like: What's going on here? We're used to knowing more than the public. And so we can investigate in a relatively quiet way. Now, there were investigators from all around the world and who quite quickly came up with a possible scenario. That took some getting used to. But we quickly reacted to that, saying: This is an opportunity, not a threat. We also had to go on the Internet and look very seriously at what they brought to the table. In a short time period, we made the shift from initial hesitation to deciding that this was part of our investigation. Amateurs or not, they're good at gathering information. But when they start to publish names, involving such a serious case they take on quite a responsibility. We've said this to them repeatedly. Before you accuse someone of a role in this whole story you need to be sure that you're able to prove it. - Good luck. - Thanks. I don't think I would've been here if it weren't for Bellingcat. It feels as if Bellingcat is family now. We give each other strength through the investigations we do. Sometimes as a big group, sometimes as individuals but always as a collective. We've learned so much from each other. We've given each other so much strength, energy and trust and created a platform together. I wouldn't have been at The New York Times if it wasn't for Bellingcat. What I do at The New York Times, is applying the Bellingcat method doing open source investigations into a very wide range of subjects. At Bellingcat, everything is possible. We can investigate anything we want to. At The New York Times I'm learning how to make it accessible for a large audience. You really zoom in, like we do at Bellingcat. What's nice, is that there we can publish a report and put in everything we found. All the details and side steps that are part of that investigation. At The New York Times you zoom in and then out again. You leave out a lot of details in the final video or article because it has to appeal to a larger audience. Imagine, you're a citizen of your country. Suddenly, there's this man who betrays his own country. How would you, or any representative of any country sitting here, view him? He's simply a scumbag and that's all there is to it. I was in a coma for 20 days. I suffered from meningitis. I slowly woke up again and at first didn't know where I was. And only thanks to the support of my family and my other daughter I slowly started to get better again. In total, I spent three months in the hospital before I was released again. Since its start in 2014 Bellingcat has grown from a couple of volunteers to an investigation team with 10 full-time staff members and dozens of people contributing to the investigations. The team has over 1000.000 followers on Twitter and their website is gaining more traction with every case they work on. By regularly giving workshops and organizing events, they have already trained hundreds of professionals and citizens Bellingcat's methods. Subtitles ripped by gooz karagarga, 2020
