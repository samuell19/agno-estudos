Dumbass. You're a dumb-ass. Billo, remember dinner at my place tonight? I know it's six. Don't tell me you were sleeping. Six is the perfect time. Bye! Invite only the medium wealthy, for goodness' sake, under fifty million. Good food, but don't go over the top. Elide. Elide, wake up! Remember, you and your husband are dining at my place tonight. No, not just us. Just us, maybe another time. What? You can't make it? You're dining with the President? Bring him along, persuade him. He's a friend of mine. He got some, too... I'm telling you he got some. Yeah, he got some thanks to me. Tell him I'm making pasta and broccoli. Try to... okay. Bye. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - Cappuccino for me. - Me too. Didn't we say no caffeine? Federico, three cold-pressed juices: asparagus, kiwi, kale and ginger. - How are things? - Good. Remember the conviction for tax evasion in 2012? Have you given up salt? Do you check your blood pressure? 70/130... Don't listen to those who say 140/90. They're a bunch of assholes and they're full of shit. Excuse me a moment. Quick, a slot's freed up. - Let's go. - Where? Kazakhstan. At the beginning, a city is a street... After a while, the street turns into a parked van. Further on, it needs a post office... for the employee, for the driver and a school for their kids. Where there was once a desert, a metropolis springs up. Right here, at the crossroads of hundreds of oil fields, right where we are now. I have approval from the local government. We're moving on to the second phase: construction. I guarantee you 23% over four years, on an annual basis. In five years you'll double your capital, quadruple it in eight years. Dimitri, you'll say: "But there's nothing here! No food, no water." We'll bring everything. Where's the problem? Now you can give me all the bad news you want. Remember that small conviction for tax fraud in 2012? There's no way out, the sentence is confirmed. Did you pay the judges? We did everything that could be done. - Find an alternative solution. - We did. You'll spend a year doing community service. - It's an alternative solution. - Alternative to what? To jail. What kind of fucking lawyers are you? What do I pay you for? I pay you! If I wake up early in the morning, I can go to this center for an hour, then fly to Kazakhstan. - I'd be back the same day. - They're taking away your passport. Get out of my car! Out! Fuck off! You're a rude ingrate! After everything we've done for you! - Fuck you! - Treating your lawyers like this... We saved you from bankruptcy! We saved you from jail, you bastard! You're gonna walk! Do you hear me? Assholes! Fuck you! I AM TEMPESTA What do you think about the sentence you received? - Good morning. - What? I said, good morning. If you want, the sockets for recharging are over there. You're new. It shows. But don't worry about it, we've all been there... A few months ago, I was opening a café in partnership. Then my wife left me, the debts... They took everything, I was hit by a tsunami! All I have left is my son. The only one who loved me. Why couldn't they take him and leave all the rest? - Just kidding, Nicola. - Ah, okay. This is the best place, the food's good, there are lockers... In Italy, the poor have it good. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. - Numa Tempesta. How are you? - Angela Borracetti. - Very well, and you? - Not too bad. - All good? - I get by. Come. I was reading in the court documents that it says "no permanent address". - Is that a joke? - No, it's true. I don't own a house, I buy a hotel chain, or a single hotel and I live in it until I sell it. Owning a house is rather... Still here? Are you boosting the snacks? He takes them to school. They go to waste. Bruno, if you sleep on the streets again, I'll call social services. I told you it was temporary, just two... three days... Let's go, we'll be late for school. I need my passport for certain business I have abroad. As you know, I am an ambassador for Italian excellence in the world. - Really? In what do you excel? - I make money, try me. I can turn a profit from anything, even this place. Come over one of these evenings. Bring the nuns, if they're allowed out. How do you do? Numa Tempesta. Mr Tempesta, enough of these shenanigans. The judge will ask for my opinion about your passport and my opinion will be a no. The people who use the facility will report on your behavior and you need to prove that you can empathize with them. I see. - Sorry. - You'll get this back tonight. You can't do that! This is a crisis response unit, where people in need can come. They come during the day to use basic services: showers, clean clothes... there's a cafeteria, a hairdresser... We guarantee lunch, breakfast and shelter until 5:00pm. This is where all the workers are. Watch what they do, because you'll do it today. When you're done, come to me to sign out. If you complain about the place, we were supposed to be here for three months, it's been three years. Thank you, government, for the shit you make us wallow in every day! Let's go pray. That's why you're well dressed, they put you in the storeroom. Good one. But couldn't you find a suit for me? A jacket and tie... Listen, could I make a phone call? Short. It's urgent. Short, I've got 8 euros and 50 cents. Bambi? Bambi? Listen to me... Yeah.. Send me his private number to this phone, quick! Done? - Carolyn! - What? You're making another call? You're dining at my place tonight. I sent divers out to get the fish. - Divers? - You're coming with your personal jet? Have you got a slot at Ciampino? If not I can take care of it. - He's crazy. - What's the weather like in Stockholm? - Fuck, the credit's finished. - In Stockholm? I'm going to kill you! 8 euros 50 and it's finished? You're gonna pay me back! No, you owe me a million euros if that bitch doesn't show up for dinner because of this deadbeat phone! - Who are you calling a "deadbeat"? - Calm down. What did you call me? Calm down. He called me a deadbeat! You are here to pay back the damage you inflicted on civil society with your uncivil behavior. If it happens again, there'll be a warning, then an injunction and after that, jail. - May I explain? - You used up all his credit. - Give him 10 euros. - Actually, it was 8.50. All right, 8.50. He can get it from my driver, if you let him out... Bruno is free to come and go as he pleases. You're the one who can't leave here until you've done your time. I've thought about it, I'd rather go to jail. You sure? I only have to call the judge. But jail would be too easy for you. You'd go there and buy everybody. Here it's worse. I can't be bought. And be quiet! Let's go. Bruno, tell me if there are any problems. You ruined my afternoon... Where's the driver? Outside... - There's a Maserati. - What color? Gray. Dunno if I have any change. Let's see... 50... You're one euro short. Here's 30 cents... Let's see what else I got here. Good night. Now go home. Thank you. You know I'm working on the revision of the Welfare Act? I have twenty years' experience in the field... Can I give you some advice? Go ahead. Take advantage of this year in here to open your heart. My heart? Yes, yes... I'll do that. We'll be hunky-dory here, right? - I imagined worse. - It's not too cold. Look at this dumb-ass. He's here too, dumb-ass. You're a dumb-ass! Dumbass! You're a dumb-ass! - What are you doing? - He's a dumb-ass. After laying into him like that, what you gonna do? - Who's he got it in for? - The guy in the magazine... The guy from the center... - It's him, see? - Yeah. "Numa Tempesta, wealthy Roman entrepreneur..." That's why he's such a prick. Nicola? Look who's in the magazine. The guy who comes to the center... "Numa Tempesta, wealthy entrepreneur. - Luxury yacht... - 60 meters... Private jets, property, hotels, a life of luxury." He's in with us. You should have told him about your conviction. In Italy, these things don't matter, they're bullshit, résumé filler. Does this look like the dinner of a convict? I'll build two cities! Not one. I'm calm. You're not, huh? Not so much. You should eat walnuts, get back to your roots. I have half the world coming to dinner, I'm gonna get some major funding, I'm reeling them all in. What year were you born, Dimitri? 1975. I'll send you six bottles of '75 that I filched from an Arab sheikh at an auction. I'll send you a case of beets that I grow. You can make borscht with it. - You're not eating, sir? - No. I don't wanna fucking eat. Fuck it. In this country, capitalism is amoral. They formalize over a conviction. Where's the Christian charity? You shouldn't feel guilty, you followed your conscience. I studied this yesterday. Don't worry, that's how it is... - You did what you had to do. - They should go after real crooks. They sentence a hard-working guy like me. I'm always working! My therapist says: "Play, Numa." But when? Look, in Kazakhstan, I've created a masterpiece. I've created a masterpiece. Another round... I would have made it! - Enough about Kazakhstan, come on. - Let's go to bed. - I'm not coming to bed. - It's late. - Come on, let's go to bed. - Please. - Not to bed. - Why are you being like this? - Don't take me to bed. - We'll talk again tomorrow. Who the fuck are you? A relative, a friend? - Now don't be rude. - Fuck you! - Where are you going? - Numa! - Do you love me? - Of course, lots. - Even though I'm a dumb-ass? - You're not a dumb-ass. I swear you're not a dumb-ass. Tell the waiters to wrap it all up... - The meat... - Sure... now go to sleep. - Did we make love? - Of course. Yes... Guys, don't eat straightaway, don't act like you're starving. Meat and fish together, I'm offering you this combination... But the meat has to be the best in the world, Kobe beef that comes from an area in Japan where the cows are delicately massaged from dawn till dusk, and they listen to classical music. And we'll wash it down with this Jermann. It will pair perfectly, with a hint of citrus and salt. Perfect with either the Kobe or the shellfish. Dig in! What...? Stop! - What are you doing? - I knew it. We had to hurry. He's talked our ears off, and we haven't eaten a thing. Nothing comes in that's not certified by the Health Department. But I'll speak to the Health Minister, are you serious? Throw it all away, into the trash! If there's an inspection they'll close us down! If there's an inspection I'll go to jail, got that? - You, come with me. - What a pity, this is good stuff. Looks like we're back to soup. They need listening to, not crustaceans and lobsters! Try to listen to them if you really want to make progress. And don't interrupt me! Come on, open up. Just think, once I was an engineer... - Tell me about it. - It all began with a heart attack. Wait... Heart attack? Is that the beginning? The end, this is it. It's better if I tell you my story. Yours would bore us to tears. Mine's more fun. You're not interested? The Lord is with me! - He'll save me! - He'll save us! He'll save me! Follow me. He'll help me! He'll help you, he'll save you! Go on, faster, come on! 23 million into Luxembourg and 40 into Cayman One. Is Nobara answering from Tokyo? Tell Dimitri not to get anxious. A lot of Italian oligarchs are interested in the project. Hurry! Fuck! The crapper's filthy. He's right, you could clean it a bit better. It's about pride in one's work, it's better for you. Clean it. Here. Give me your plate. I want the Japanese one. The Japanese meat's in Japan, Gramps. Eat this and stop busting my balls. Whoever your god may be, may Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. How did it go this week? So-so... We need to talk about him a bit. - What do you say about our new guest? - He's selfish. - He's a bastard. - He only talks about money. They're discriminating against me. It seems strange... Are you discriminating against him? His presence makes us feel poor, he makes us believe we are. What's wrong with that? Italians have always been great paupers! We've exported them everywhere: America, Germany, Belgium... We got nothing against you, but we hope that one day we'll see you and rich people like you down here under the bridges with us. Stop it! We shouldn't care about his yacht, his villas, his millions. If those were the important things, we wouldn't be worth anything. Am I right or not? You've got an account with a thousand million euros, is that true? I manage a fund, not an account. A fund with one and a half billion euros. Buddy, I read it in the paper. A thousand million euros... A thousand million euros is that more or less than a billion? A lot more. I read a thousand million euros not a billion and a half. A thousand million is a billion, period. A thousand million's one thing, and a billion's another. Millions aside, how the fuck did you make all that money? - By bossing people around? - You wanna know how to make money? It's simple. I was born poor, I've always worked. I know you don't believe it. Bruno, adjourn the meeting. You were born poor, and you stayed that way. I can't listen to him anymore, adjourn the meeting! - Go clean the bathroom! - And we're the poor ones? Come with me, don't listen to him. You want to know the truth? You're poor here. - You're poor inside. - Come and pray. - Fuck you! - No, fuck you! Aren't you ashamed? Get outta here! PAJAMAS Nicola! - I've been waiting for an hour! - What can I say...? - All good at school? - Yeah. Then quit complaining. Is it available right away? Yeah... Can you see anyone in there? - Has it got electricity? - I'll put in a generator. Just look at it, it's a gem... View of the Tiber, parking... - Yeah, lovely... - Lovely things cost. - How much? - 200 euros. 200? I'll think about it, I'll let you know. Don't think too hard, 'cause I don't have time to waste. Come on... - I'll come up with it... - 200 euros? As if! No, I'm not interested in subscribing. I'm not interested in subscribing. Tell 'em to fuck off, they're a bunch of thieves. They all steal. All they know how to do is ask for money... Subscription... Greco, I mean, c'mon! Do you really have to stop at every trashcan? Easy, brother... You got it in for me today? Easy, take it easy. You gotta do my back, not my arms, I can reach them. They're paying you... at least, do something. Who are you? Uh-huh, right... It's me, Radiosa. - Do we know each other? - I come every Thursday. But because I'm a hooker, perhaps for you I don't exist. - But weren't there two of you? - That was the other two. I see. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm about to jump your bones. Let's go for a drive now, later maybe... Numa, there's something I want to know. Do you know what your therapist says? It doesn't do you any good if you don't do it at least twice a week. Did you do it with Clea and Mimosa last time? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Swear on it. - I swear. So, who's missing? Radiosa. Let's go for a drive. - Please. - All right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I must say, money doesn't cost anything these days. I get 4.5% interest on an annual basis. - That's not bad... - No, absolutely. - But with your money? - No, the bank lends it to me at 1.5%. - 3% profit... - Yes, clean. - Very good! - Thanks. Federico, stop! Hey there, Greco! Mr Numa Tempesta! Hi, how are you? I'm taking the young lady for a spin. Good evening. - Where are the others? - They've gone to the shelter. On the Esquiline Hill, nearby. I'm going to visit them. If I go home, I won't sleep anyway. I'd sleep all the time if I could, only I don't have a house. I found a new coffeemaker. Look, people throw out brand-new things. Well, good night and enjoy, I'll see you tomorrow. Till tomorrow, then. We'll get coffee. That way. - Skinny, there's a line. - What do you want? You pushed in. - Me? - You were supposed to stay at the back. I was here already. She's the one who pushed in. - Don't be aggressive. - I've been here the whole time. She's the one who pushed in. Get your hands off me! He put his hands on me! Now I'll put mine on you! - There's a kid. - What happened? Enough! Why is he doing that? Awesome, Tempesta. - What are you doing here? - Damn them. - Mrs Tempesta, good evening. - Yeah, right... Hi! Hurry, I don't want to be found with convicted felons! We're friends... You're not a convicted felon, are you? You're a felon, not me. You know the secret to not losing when you buy and sell hotels? Get in before the Chinese and the Arabs, then flip it to them. And if they don't pay you what you want, you set up a center for the poor. Right on. Look how beautiful, the first one. I bought it when I made my first 10 million euros. - Don't touch. - Can I play? - Of course you can. - Have you done your homework? What's the connection? - I don't have any money. - I had two euros... It takes 50-cent pieces. This one's on me. Hey, look, what a beauty. They say playing is good for you. Making love, too. Come on, play. Baby, I wanted to ask you something. Without the houses, the fleet of cars and all these pinball machines, if you could choose, would you choose him or me? Him. Him? - Why? - He's nice. I'll give her to you. Excuse me? - You're giving me away? - You made me miss. - Of course. - No, he was joking. Good night, then, I gotta go: I have class early tomorrow. Good night. Can I play another game? - Are you offended? - No. Not even a little bit? Offended? What for? - He's a kid... - Not even a little bit? My son's here... You wanna friend me? Sure. - I'll add you. - Radiosa. Good night. Good night. Nicola, you'll never guess what I found. Take those goggles off. Look, now you see me... Now you don't, right? Now you see me... and now you don't. - Can you see me now? - Yes. And now? - Cool, huh? - Yeah. Dad. What is it? Oh, God! Oh, God! What a night! In the past few days, without my phone I've lost 30 million. Do you realize? 30 million! But last night I slept like a log. Engineer? - Has Bruno been around today? - How should I know? If you were going to give Bruno a present, what would you give him? He needs everything, so anything would be fine. Good evening. I have two gifts for you from Mr Tempesta. Really? Whaddaya know, Tempesta... - What are they? - Pajamas. - What are they? - Pajamas. - He gave us two pairs of pajamas. - They're silk. To thank you for the other night, he slept well thanks to you. - What do we do with pajamas? - Put them on. I wish he'd send money, not pajamas! - Take them back to him. - Don't get mad. Anyway he's given us the present now. They're cute, with pussycats. Look how nice they are. - Do you like them? - They're not ugly. Look how nice he looks. They suit him. He looks like someone else. You look really cute in those pajamas. He's sleeping like a little angel. They look so sweet... How much do you think those pajamas are worth? 300 euros, more even. And there are bottoms, too. I know about pajamas, but I've never seen any like this. Really nice pajamas, silk? Yeah, it's all silk. - How much did you want? - 200. But I've changed my mind. I want 300. - First, this is all illegal. - So? I can give you 80, and that's already a gift. No way. 90? - 100! - Yeah, all right... It's all illegal here. All right, I'll go and report you. I'll go have a word with someone, we'll see how it ends up. - Listen, come here. - You're charging for something illegal. All right, I'll give it to you for 90. Just to keep you happy. Now give me the bond. My word is my bond, let's shake on it. Your word, for real? Go take a flying fuck! Smartass pulled a fast one on me! Did you like the pajamas...? As soon as I got these things, I thought you were an asshole. I was really pissed at you. But, actually, once we put them on... Everyone looked at us differently... So now, what happened? That I've got pajamas, but I need everything else. And I want it. Right. So, what do you want to do? I've already made a deal for a mobile home. 90 euros, and to think she wanted 300. Lend me 100 euros. How can I get it to you? How? Tell your driver, he's got a wad of cash like this. Yes, but you can't give me a receipt. If I give you 100 euros, will you let me out earlier? Not by myself. But if you stop pissing off everybody in here, maybe Angela will put in a good word with the judge. - How do you come into it? - Who does the reports? Who? We do them, us... the people who use this facility... Each time we have to write an evaluation. Maybe 'cause it's you, maybe 'cause we have prejudices, but till now what have we written? - That you're a prick. - Perfect. I mean, you're rolling in cash... so start giving something, right? Besides, on a human level, you'll never make it. I'll pick out twenty for you, Angela's pets. Go to your driver and get 100 euros to give to each of them. You'll see how the empathy swells, the prejudice collapses... Yeah, but twenty's too many. - Ten. - Fifteen. Let's make it ten. I'll bring you the best of the worst. You and me are like twins. You've had more opportunities, but we're cut from the same cloth. No, he can't buy us. - I have my dignity. - Bravo. 100 euros! - 100 euros... - All right, if it's 100... When Angela asks us how Mr Tempesta is, how he behaves at the center... - Good. - Bravo. - What do we write for empathy? - Strong empathy. Single file and let's get this paperwork done. Easy, guys. Lurch, you're such a bully. Thank you. For me to... - Didn't I give it to you? You sure? - When? - If you're sure, all right then. - I've organized all this... - You can walk, Boccuccia? - I can walk...? - Oh, my God! - Hadn't you noticed? - It's a miracle! - A miracle... You're a scam artist. I told you everything's gonna be fine. It took us a while... Can you imagine in springtime? It'll be spectacular here. We're the kings of Rome! You made me look like a fool! He gives you each 100 euros and you gamble it away. I'd like to know how you did it, what you did with the money. We bought scratch cards... What idiots! Lesson number one: with a scratch card, or an "Instant Lottery" you won't win a fucking thing. They should call it "Instant Loser", because the house, that is the state, always wins. I'll prove it to you. An "Instant Lottery", please. - How much? - Five. In theory, I ought to be a lucky guy, right? And yet, not even I win. See? He won! - 300 euros! - I wanted to buy it! You wanted to buy it, but you didn't. None of you bought it, and you know why? You know why? 'Cause you're a bunch of losers. You're the man! I'll give you 100 euros each. 100 euros... I want to test you. And I'll tell you what, those of you who come back with 10% on top, will get another 100. I know what's ruining all of you, Bruno. That place where you go, it's made you soft, slack. - It's true. - How can we make 10% extra? Set up a business, move your ass, test the waters. It's lousy with money out there, you just have to go look for it. Bearing in mind that everything's legal until they catch you. - What are you waiting for? Go! - Let's go, guys. Pumped! - What am I? - You're great! Not great, empathetic! Come on, snap out of it! He knows we're cut from the same cloth. It takes a bullshitter to know a bullshitter. Bruno! - What are you doing? - Out with the girls? Yes. - Wanna come to dinner? - I dunno... - Come on! - Is it on you? You gonna make us beg? - We'll come for sure. - Totally, we weren't joking. Nice friends. - Psychology... - We're psychologists. Psychology. - Far out... - It shows, right? We decided to work with our bodies now, then, as psychologists with our brains. When I die, I've decided to donate my body to science. I want to give myself to all mankind. Obviously, an organ at a time, not the whole package at once. So, what do you do? Someone comes along, lies on the couch and tells you stuff? - Yes, we analyze them. - Analyze me, then. - Stand up, let's take a look. - Good, turn around. Do a little turn. Lift your head. A good father, you can see that. Just like that? Absolutely. - I can also say that... - She said "a good father". I can see that in spite of going through hard times, you're determined to make it. - And that's important. - What hard times? We've been lucky. You don't know my wife... You've got a good relationship. Not like Numa's with his father. Poor thing. - Poor thing, so to speak... - No, believe me. Numa's father thought his son was a dumb-ass. And he used to say to him in the cradle: "Dumbass, dumb-ass..." - The father to the son? - He never told him any stories. - Not even Little Red Riding Hood. - Not even the fable of Baby Jesus. Then this paternal figure abandoned the family. For years, total silence... The father disappeared, no one knew where. Numa's suffering, he can't sleep. Numa can make all the money he wants, but until he sews up this tear he has inside, he'll always be at square one. A non-conflict, a disappointing conflict. So, now I'm looking for something more substantial. Of course. - But it's problematic. - Why? No one has real problems. Do you know anyone who's suffering? I know people without a dime, up to their armpits in trouble... But what does that mean? These days, people are fine. - There's no more... - Unfortunately, you're right. True suffering, like there was once, doesn't exist anymore. You're right. There's no more suffering. In fact, it's a problem for us, everyone's happy. The restaurants are all full, and they say the economy's bad... - Like this? - It's not true! This one, because it's late... Actually, it is a bit late. - I'll see you again, right? - Of course. See you around. - Bye, girls. - Be good. - You're gorgeous! - So are you! What does that mean? I don't understand it. I found an article about Tempesta. "I'll reveal my tips for making money." But I don't understand a thing. Take a look, you studied math... "When a company in the trust fails, the earnings of all the others increase immediately." Dad, it's easy, I'll finish reading it then explain it to you. Look at this dumb-ass. I knew he was a dumb-ass. - Will you cut it out? - What are you talking about? You're the dumb-ass here, knock it off. Cut it out, the cops are coming. I couldn't care less if you call the cops. Stop it. You're a dumb-ass... you and him. I don't believe it... - It's a madhouse. - This guy's a dumb-ass. This guy's a dumb-ass. You were in prison and you're going back there. Nicola! Mind your own fucking business. Nicola, mind your own fucking business! He's a dumb-ass. This guy spends more time inside than out. Well, we've studied the matter in a detailed manner. All together, we have capital assets of 1,000 euros. If we were banks instead of people, what would we do? When things start to go south, when the market's flat and we have to show we're turning a profit, we let one of us go broke and split the loss. Imagine we're all banks. The Greco Bank, the Lurch Bank, the Boccuccia Bank. We make the Boccuccia Bank fail and we share his 100 euros. He says: "I haven't got a dime, I've gone broke." Whereas we get 10 euros a head, the famous 10%... Then we go to Mr Tempesta and he'll give us another 100. I have to go broke? - You don't go broke, it's pretend. - It's a joke. This is stuff for huge sons of huge bitches. High finance stuff... You wanna be in business or not? So tell me, who are you? Sons of bitches. - I didn't hear you. - Sons of bitches. - Shout it, who are you? - Sons of bitches! Stand up, join hands! - Who are we? - Sons of bitches! Tempesta, we're coming for your ass! WE ARE TEMPESTA I lost everything, I made bad investments. Finance gives and finance takes away, the market is cruel. Well, what can you do? - It doesn't always go well. - Is there anyone else who...? - Have you made a profit? - All of you? You're taking the piss. I don't have cash for everybody right now. - There's a problem. - Angela! - Just kidding. - He's got it. Here it is. - We began to share with him. - It's true. Today, he listened and understood my needs. He's most kind. - I feel I've been heard, too. - We're communicating. Good. Bruno, what do you say? There's a certain empathy starting to go around. Yeah, for me too. Numa, do you want to share? What I feel like saying is that little by little, with these people, who I can rightly call my brothers, I've realized that empathy is the best business. It's always like this. If we give, others give back. With interest. Evidently, you've started to give... And this relationship will turn into love, because love is empathy with interest. Empathy! Empathy! Empathy! Empathy! We need to give! Give! Guys! What do you say to some spaghetti at my place? I don't have any plans tonight, let's see what the others think. Nothing fancy. Hey, Bruno? - May I? - Here you are. - Coming in. - Come. Hi, Numa. Good evening. We haven't brought anything. Don't worry. Just look at your house! My God! It's spectacular! - We could have a concert. - Good evening, Engineer. Look at the furniture. Thank you for coming. - What a house! - I'll lead the way. - It's amazing. - Do you like it, Boccuccia? Follow me, this way. - What a house! - It's five floors. - Five big floors. - This is a Caravaggio... In a place like this you gotta be careful, because the Russians come, the Chinese, the Arabs, they try to rip you off, undercut you on the price. Whereas us, until they give us what Numa says, we won't give them this place. We'd rather open a center for the needy. What are you talking about? - You said it yourself. - Yes, I said it. A center for the needy... - Can I have a word? - Yes. Sure, what is it? I just wanted to tell you that I know where your father is. What do you know about my father? And anyway I don't give a shit about him. - All these people! - Did we get the wrong night? No, they're all friends. - Professor Boccuccia. - Good evening. - It's a pleasure. - The pleasure's all mine. It's a pleasure to meet these springtime blossoms. Thank you. Boccuccia... let's wind it up... At last some interesting people here. We like it here. Hi, is this your doing? Didn't you say you like people with problems? These guys are full of problems. You're getting my hair wet! Now I'll introduce you to someone who's riddled with problems. Engineer, I'd like you to meet a friend. Hi. Roll out the list. No, I don't feel like telling the same old story every time. She's a specialist. First, deep in your eyes I saw an important personal history. All right, now I'll tell you something. First, there was the heart attack. How do I know you're not bluffing about my father? What story did my father tell me when I was little? Your father didn't tell you any stories when you were little, because no father tells stories to a son who's a dumb-ass. I see... Tell me where he is. Is 100 euros enough? - I want a legal casino. - A casino? - And where will I find one? - I read that you have 12 in Rome alone. - And what will you do with a casino? - I need a steady job for my dad. You take care of yours and I'll take care of mine. - You feel an inexplicable sadness? - Yeah, exactly. - Do you have religious visions? - No. Do you imagine putrefying organs? - Low self-esteem? - Yes. Hold on. Girls, depression with low self-esteem, without putrefaction fantasies, is it secondary or reactive? - Ask if he has religious visions. - Of course I asked that! Then it's neurotic depression. - Neurotic? - Yes. That's fabulous, you've got neurotic depression, the opposite of a psychotic one, which is a disaster. But I studied neurotic depression, it's easy. - Are you in therapy? - I think I just need to be put down. What's this, confession? Are you done? - Her ears are bleeding! - If I have to tell it, I tell it. Did he bother you? - You said you don't suffer. - No, I suffer. - I suffer. - No, believe me, I do... I'm suffering a lot. In my life I've done some weird stuff, but with a refugee... You're a sort of refugee, aren't you? I'm gonna catch you. Where are you going? You think I won't catch you? Now I'm going to destroy you. You shouldn't have brought me here. Holy mother! I feel like crying. No, don't cry. Hold me tight. So, you don't want to tell me how you managed to multiply your money... You tell me, at least. Finance is something you do also to have fun, to be with people who get along. It's not just serious. - We get along, don't we, Boccuccia? - Sure do. We're friends, and with friends there can't be any secrets. Aren't we? Friends for life. Well, my friend, tell me how you multiplied the money? - Friends? - I just said so. We made one of us fail and we shared his money. Snitch! You created a speculative bubble with poor people? I've been doing that all my life! But you really are poor devils, you speculated on me and you know I'm in trouble... it's not right. It's finance, someone always has to get screwed... Today it was you, tomorrow who knows. You truly have become huge sons of bitches. Now I can call you colleagues, quite rightly so! We had a good time, a nice evening... Can we come back? Whenever you want, just knock and I'll let you in. Bye. - Friend me! - You'll accept though, right? - Bye. - We'll text. - Bye, Bruno. Bye, Nicola. - Bye, girls. - Do you have an umbrella? - No. Bring it with you next time. Bye, Numa. Bye, Tempesta darling. Numa, I've kept the investors in place until now, but they've lost faith in you. - They've contacted a new fund in Dubai. - What that fuck are you saying, Dimitiri? The investment was contingent on new partners coming in. There are no new partners. Have you brought in any new partners? No. It's pointless spinning the same bullshit. The deal's dead, everyone wants to get out, me included. The game is over, my friend. It's over, Numa. NAIL POLISH The empathy has grown. It's become love, hasn't it? Almost. So? You're only thinking of yourself, your passport, the signature, and the others? Today the Welfare Reform Act passed. I've been asking for a meeting for months, all for nothing, the law passed. Next week it's going to the Senate, those sons of... You want to be heard in the Senate? No problem: we'll buzz them and go in. Really? I hadn't thought of that, you know... - Do you bring chocolates? - Yes, a bottle, Champagne, something... - At last you've ditched the poncho. - Yes. - Very classy. - Come on... I'm still a saint. - Not bad at all. - Really... Why are you talking like Lieutenant Columbo? I am Lieutenant Columbo. The number of people assisted in the past year has risen to 4%, we now have 3,455. The majority are foreigners, but the percentage of Italians is increasing. The lack of work is the biggest problem in this country. Many have been ruined by gambling. Employment, income, housing, health care are the primary needs of the people we tend to. Now I'd like to submit my 25 new points to you. Are all the disks here? We'll take care of it. - Don't worry. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Go. I've been working on this for two years. - How much? - The usual, two. But this is a poor law, for poor people. Let's make it half. Hello. Get in, I'll drop you at home. I don't think I should. - I got these for you. - Why? Because you were good. Beautiful. Did you pick the color? No. - Is it real leather? - Yes. It's beautiful. Want to watch the news? You have a TV in your car. Who are you? I'm Tempesta. And who are you? I'll let you know when I find out. Turn on the TV, Federico. Is the reception good? - Like at home? - Better. In the Welfare Commission, the speaker added some amendments petitioned by the world of volunteering to be added to the law on the welfare system. Was it you? Really? How did you do it? A good law costs the same as a bad one. The rate's the same, so it may as well be good. And anyway, we did it for them. I didn't ask you to pay graft. A bottle of wine? It's a courtesy, not graft. - So, you live here. - Yeah, been here for 15 years. Aren't you going to invite me up for a coffee? I've got decaf. Decaf? Perfect. A nice cup of decaf. My place is a mess. - You're worried about mess? - Yes. That's very middle class, not like you at all. I don't have servants, drivers... - Who does? - I earn 1,300 euros a month. - Jeez, that's a lot. - I do everything by myself. Good for you. - I think I'm out of sugar. - What the hell! But I've got honey. Sometimes I think of coming to live in a place like this. - Really? - Yes, there's humanity. - You know the life I lead, right? - What life do you lead? What floor do you live on? First. Come on, let's go. Nothing's going to land on our heads, is it? You're not coming into my home, Numa. - What does that mean? - You're not coming in. - Why? - You're not coming in, go away. I want you to leave! Go away! Do you hear me? Go away! - Calm down. - Please, leave. Be quiet. They can hear us, be quiet. Calm down. I haven't done it for six years. Six years? But certain things, you don't forget. Once you learn... - Promise me we'll do it in the dark? - In the dark. - Totally dark? - Yes. - Totally? - Yes. Let's go. - You're better looking than me. - You think so? - Yes. - No, come on. - Do you do a lot of sport? - Do I? - Sport. - Yeah, a bit. It's been a while since I have. I've been thinking, when I get out, I can set up a non-profit. What do you say? Why get out? You're well on your way. The main thing now is to consolidate your rehabilitation in the months you still have to serve. What do you mean, months? Aren't we intimate now? Yes or no? I'd say so... Won't you give me a hand? Yes, I will... together with the others. You need a little more time, but you'll make it. Bye. Good night. It's the first time I've had sex with someone over 28 and I thought it would be who knows what, but it was all right. Open your mouth, Gramps. Come on, open up. I don't want to do airplanes. He's been like that since this morning. What do you mean? I think he's dead. He's dead? What do you mean, dead? Gramps! Gramps. Gramps! He's dead. Listen to his breathing... Maybe he just fainted. Fainted? He's stone cold. What was his name? Aslan. In Kazakh, it means lion. In Kazakh? It was Gramps' wish to go back home. I think we owe it to him. Just a visa for a few days, we'll take him home. We'll go together, all of his friends, in Numa's plane. It won't cost the state anything, he'll pay for everything. What a wonderful thing. I'm saying yes because you're all asking together and it's wonderful. I fed him for months, I was fond of him. It's as if I were going to bury my father. To Numa! What would it cost me to give you each 200, 500, 1,000, 10,000...? - Then, hand it over. - That wouldn't be dignified. - You need jobs. - Then give us one, all right? If only I had one! Greco, you know all about trash, you can be in charge of recycling. - Fine. - What about me? - Didn't you have a café? - I did. We'll set you up with a chain of cafés: "Empathy Cafés". Put yourselves in my hands. We're in your hands. Partners, partners, partners! This way. Don't worry, nothing's gonna happen. Don't be scared, they're friends. I mean it, I can't... Just tidy up your beard, trim your hair and we're done. You won't bleed. But how can I work at night if I look like a rich guy? I loose credibility. Allow me to introduce Mr Jean Leonard Cocu Maumbau, CEO of Maputo holdings. Madame Laforete from the Messelink Real Estate Group. The celebrated Swedish engineer Bert Lagsberg. Arkady Osmanovski, business administrator for Ismetanagaz. All people of unquestioned professional stature. Thanks to our silent partners, who in spite of recent events, I've had some problems and many people weren't too convinced... We've managed to get this project up. Thank you. What's wrong? Just a moment. Can you hear me? Good evening, I just wanted to say a few words, too. I've had the opportunity to get to know Mr Tempesta. I understood his depth straight off. Tempesta means "storm", a name that is a force of nature. A guy who doesn't sleep at night thinking of how to make our capital grow. I am a medium rich here, together with those who deal in waste recycling... But tonight, we put one, two million... ten million a head into this project and in four years it will make us 40 million! Thank you, Mr Numa Tempesta for this great Kazakh dream! Fantastic! What a great crowd! - Hello. - Hi. What is it? We're watching. There we go! Investments are made with hearts and souls. I'm delighted with this experience, it has changed my life, my way of being. It's changing everything. Cheers! At a certain point, I wanted to come to this country because I felt that it was fertile terrain. We're all bums, we haven't got a dime. For real! We haven't got a pot to piss in, translate that. Where's your son? Your son? He's in Rome with Radiosa, I spoke to them. They're good. Send him to school, educate him because... He's fixated with school. When he makes a mistake, I mean, he's just a kid... If he fucks up, don't tell him he's a dumb-ass. Ever! Numa? Tell me something, all this stuff we did with all those millions, what's going to happen? Remember they wanted to take out? Instead, they put in. There you have it. But only they put money in. We didn't put in a cent. - Good morning, I'd like to file a report. - Of course, follow me. It's a law that was bought. He paid for it. He's a fraudster, a criminal, you have to put him in jail. If you watch TV, you'll see that he went with the poor from my center. I've dedicated twenty years to that center, my whole life. He came into my home with the excuse of having coffee... You haven't done this work for free, I got you some gifts: a share in an ailing Russian gas company, that's about to pick up very soon and I'll wire you 0.1% on the deal. You can all get a house. A couple of days and you collect. Excuse me, but a slot has freed up. You've got a flight tomorrow morning. First class, fly and eat on my tab. Keep your eye on the stock market. When Ismetanagaz goes up, it means you've screwed everyone. All right? Ismetanagaz, don't forget. Call me for anything. Do we have his number? New York closed at -0.31%. San Paolo at +40. See that? That's BRIC. Didn't you want to invest in India? - BRIC's going strong. - Then, I'll invest everything. It's flying high. The latest update, a clamorous development in the Tempesta case. A colossal fraud involving banks, politics and institutions. Numa Tempesta was arrested a short while ago. He is accused of tax evasion, embezzlement, insider trading, corruption and aggravated fraud. It all stems from the confession of a woman whose name has not been made public. She has been placed under protection due to the gravity of her revelations. "A good law costs the same as a bad one," is what Numa allegedly said to his collaborators. These revelations also unleash a political crisis because Numa's convincing arguments are connected to an amendment to the Welfare Act and after Numa's arrest, many in the goverment speak of inevitable resignations... Deadbeats, they left me here alone! Bunch of bums! It's not the done thing! Bunch of bums! Wait for me! Deadbeats! To hell with the lot of you! No, no. Sorry, but what's wrong today? Can I say something? Today I don't feel much empathy. I didn't expect it from them. Sorry, excuse me... Three before the scales. I've always known that there was chemistry between us. It couldn't just end like that... I said: "He's not gonna rip us off, is he? And sure enough... It's always been my dream, I don't know how to thank you. It's because of that speech I made in Kazakhstan, isn't it? Partly. Numa. From the bottom of my heart, it was amazing. No, thank you, Bruno. Will you leave me alone with Nicola for a moment? There's something I want to tell him. - If you don't mind. - Not a problem. - Thank you. - Thank you, Bruno. Be good. Well? What do you want to say? I kept my promise. How about it, are you going to tell me where my father is? - Well? - You lucked out this time, too. He's here. - Here, where? - In here. - You're kidding me. - Wing 7, cell 2. - How do you know that? - I just do. Nicola. Is it true? Sure is. What if I invite him to dinner? I'll make something simple... Would he like it? Study, okay? - What does it mean? - That I passed. Come here. You're hurting me, Dad... Let go of me. - Are you happy? - Very happy. You'll make me cry, damn you. You, too. Hello, Dad. My father. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. I got them to make something simple, just for us. Sit down. Let's eat. A drop of wine... Give me some of those sardines. Sardines? I knew it... I know you like them, eat up. If you leave me a couple, I'll have some, too. Enjoy. Enjoy. With all the money you have... how did you do it? How did you end up in jail? How did you do it? I don't understand. You want the sardines? - I'll try one. - I'm crazy about sardines. I know, I had them made especially for you. Parsley, vinegar, oil, lemon... Daddy's boy. You're the love of my life, give me a kiss. You are a dumb-ass, though. You're a dumb-ass, let me tell you. You're such a dumb-ass. You always told me. Remember? Mimmo, Greco, let's celebrate, he passed! Everyone to the bar! It's on the house. We need to celebrate in style. It's the evolution of the species. He passed. What did you think? Hey there, my lovelies, strong drinks all round. He's a genius. He'll become an engineer, a scientist... something amazing! - Congratulations! - What satisfaction. Radiosa is proud of you. Here, Nicola. It's time you started drinking, you're a big boy. - What are we drinking to? - To the best of them all! A toast! Nicola, you're the best. - Well done. - I'm so proud of you. - Nicola... - He studied so hard. It's great when things turn out well. Before, some of us were in the shit. Now we're working. Those who didn't sleep at night, are sleeping now, at last. Those who no one listened to are finally being heard. And also those who were looking for love, if you'll allow me... - Now it's their turn... - Jackpot! They hit the jackpot! They hit the jackpot, let me go see. I'm curious to see how much he won. Goddamn him, how much did he win? Beautiful!
