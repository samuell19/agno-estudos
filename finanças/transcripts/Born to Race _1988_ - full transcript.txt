HUMPY: It's going to be hard to convince the guys around here that you designed the modifications. ANDREA: Don't worry. After they see me assemble an engine, I'll just be one of the boys. HUMPY: [CHUCKLES] I doubt that. Anyway, it's nice to see you again, Andrea. Welcome back to Charlotte. ANDREA: Thank you, it's good to be back. ANNOUNCER: Tommy Houston hit qualifying speeds for next Saturday's All Pro 300. Hi, Chuck, how are you?Fine. This is Miss Lombardo of the Lombardo racing family. How do you do? I understand you brought your blueprints.Yes. I hear they're quite revolutionary. Yes. All right, get ready, I'm bringing him in. Right side, gas! Squeak, you're on the watch. Theo, what in the hell are you doing? We're gonna practice a pit stop. Pit stop? What are you crazy, Theo? You don't practice pit stops here. Want to bet? ANNOUNCER: Here's what happened last year, running behind Allison by a second and a half... [ANNOUNCER CONTINUES] THEO: Come on, move it, move it! That's it, that's it! Move your ass! Go! Go! go! What was that all about? Beats me. [INDISCERNIBLE CHATTER] Uh, Kenny. When I talked to Mr. Henderson this morning, I said, "Sir, one of our boys tangled with the wall "coming out of turn 2 during practice last week "and the car is history." Do you know what he said? "That wouldn't be Kenny you're referring to, would it?" Well, you didn't tell him what caused it to blow, did you, Vince? Tell a sponsor we're running nitrous? Are you crazy? The worst part is, he said if we don't finish in the top three next Saturday, he pulls the plug. I can't afford to lose that sponsor. You've got nothing to worry about, boss, I'm the best driver out there. Don't you forget it. Well, I used to be the best, and I taught you everything you know. And don't your forget it. Now get out there and help those boys. [CREW CHEERS] THEO: Hey, kid, you drive like that in tomorrow's qualifying, you go to the All Pro 300 next week. WALT: Yeah, she's sounding good, Al. BUD: How many revs you turning? AL: 5600. THEO: 34.40, not bad, not bad. AL: Yeah! THEO: Ha ha ha, all right! Okay, pit! You guys did a good job, I'm proud of you. Knothead! ANNOUNCER: The purse of over $200,000 is up for grabs. It should prove to be a very exciting competition. Miss Lombardo, I'll take that if you don't mind. [SCREAMS] No! No! No! Get the damn bag! Bitch won't let loose. [ANDREA SCREAMING] Hey! We've been spotted. ANDREA: Let go! What the hell do you think you're doing? [ANDREA SCREAMS] Come on, let's run it. KENNY: What the hell are you doing grabbing the girl? Look out. Hang on.

No, no ♪ Tryin' to get away with the... No, no ♪ With the perfect crime BUD: What the hell is wrong with you? Did you see that? Great, Al, you trashed the car! The hell with the car! Are you okay, Al? AL: They-they just nabbed that girl!WALT: What girl? I'm telling you, Walter! The one they just took off with in that Mercedes! THEO: What's going on? Theo, you better call the police. What? Damn it! Doesn't anybody understand? Two guys just grabbed this girl and took off with her! That's why I was chasing them! Well, more than likely it was just her husband. Caught her messing with some driver. THEO: How about everybody just calming down, huh? Bud, Walt, get the rig and get her to the shop. Knothead, you and the boys go home. Al, come with me. We got to qualify tomorrow and you go out and smash up the car. I didn't smash it up, man. Oh, well, you might as well have. Do you think Sphinx is gonna pay for this when he finds out about the stunt you just pulled? Yeah, we lose him, we lose everything. That's bullshit, and you know it. Stay off my back, all right? Okay, guys, let's knock it off, please. Get her inside, and we'll fix it. Yeah, sure... Fix it. He tore the fitting off the pan, and we ain't got another one in there. Great, I told ya. There ain't no way we're gonna make that qualifier tomorrow. Walt, shut up, all right! I hope you would have done the same thing if you saw some girl being roughed up! Hey, she probably deserved it. You just got carried away with some damn-fool romantic idea of yours. Yeah, you probably been reading too many of them paperbacks in the store. Come on, guys, I've got an idea. Let's just get her inside. Bud, you know where the epoxy is, right? BUD: Sure. Another Saturday night down the drain. ANDREA: Stop it! Stop it, you pig! Why don't you just shut the hell up? Now, you are really starting to get on my nerves! Oh, no, ah, stop! DUPLAIN: Who wants out? [PHONE RINGING] Don't anybody move, I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming. Yeah? It's Kenny. Yeah. How'd everything go? Just fine. Except the girl put up a hell of a fight. [CHUCKLES] Um, but you got the blueprints.? That's what I'm trying to tell you. We also got the girl. What? What the hell went wrong? I suggest you ask these geniuses you hired. Those idiots, I don't want any part of a kidnapping. Try this on for size... Some nut in a stock car saw us and lit out after us. I don't know who it was, but I shook him. Shit. Listen, I can't talk. McGruffy's here, right now, I gotta go. MAN: Come on, you're holding up the game. [CHUCKLES] Well, we got the blueprints. Anything the matter? Oh, nothing them boys can't handle. Now, who wants how many? Before I beat you, anyway. Two... Three... And the dealer takes one. Hide the car. Stay put. I'll be back. Thanks. [CHUCKLES]I am sorry about the car, Theo. It's okay, we've been through bigger wrecks together. Why would anyone kidnap a girl at the track? I checked around. Word is there's an Italian engineer in town with some new plans. Maybe she's involved. What? She must have been something. Oh, she was gorgeous, you know what I mean? Gorgeous. Well, you never saw her. Maybe. But you don't know where she is, and she doesn't know you exist. Yeah, well, I sure spoiled Bud and Walt's Saturday night with their girls. Yeah, but don't worry about the boys, there's other nights. The important thing is we qualify tomorrow. You can do it. What do you figure she's worth? Well, from what old Dupe said, her daddy's a big, powerful Italian car maker. I figure he's good for at least a million or two. I think old Dupe used to race for him way back when. Yeah, well, Dupe got the plans he wanted. Kenny gets to be a racing star. I tell ya, slick, I ain't too clear on what you and me get out of this. Well, you can bet your ass we're gonna get something. [LAUGHS] Well, how do you feel about the car, Al? Well, Theo's never let me down yet. So what are you gonna do after you qualify? I don't know, probably spend a little time with the boys, have a couple beers or something. Don't you ever think about spending time with me? Well, what did you have in mind, Jen? I thought we'd go for a swim or something. That's all. That's all? Well, I am not skinny dipping with Bud's little sister. What's my brother got to do with you and me? Let's get this car loaded and qualified, huh? ANNOUNCER: Out of turn 4, and heading for the green flag, Al Pagura, in the 61 car, on his first qualifying lap. Pagura, trying to qualify for his first superspeedway race. Hey, Sphinx, who's your tailor? Don't you get smart with me, you, you, Mr. Smartie. Why are you not wearing my t-shirt? Why do you think I'm sponsoring this team, huh? Why do you think I'm pouring money into this? For the advertising. You're getting your money's worth, Sphinx. How are we doing, Theo? Real good, one more lap. WALT: What ya got, Theo?34.5. ANNOUNCER: He's coming down for the white flag. Damn! All right, Al, go baby! ANNOUNCER: Here's the time on the first lap... 34.45, speed 157. Good line, good line... THEO: How does she feel? She's a little loose. You're good, Al, you're good. Push it a little more. Come on, Al, that's it. ANNOUNCER: The final lap of qualifying. [ENGINE SPUTTERS] Uh-oh, he's lost an engine. He broke my car, that's another expensive. Relax.That boy is not a good driver. He's a very good driver. And we'll fix your car. ANNOUNCER: It looks like Pagura will stand on his first qualifying time. Here's the next qualifier... JENNY: Whoo! Congratulations, Al.Yeah! You can forget about my father! He won't pay! Oh, come on. You're too valuable and way the hell and gone too good-looking to get wasted. Yeah, here we go. "Enrico Lombardo, Milano, Italy." JOEL: It will cost you $2 million American to get her back. It will take me time to come up with that kind of money. You understand that? Yeah, well, how much time are you talking about? Give me 48 hours, I'll be at her hotel. You can contact me there. Listen... You'll get what you want. Just don't hurt her, you understand? Well, that depends on you, Lombardo. Now don't you call the police. This is a personal matter... Between you and me. I want to talk to her. Sure thing. Listen real good. All right now, sweetheart, you talk real nice to poppa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Hey, hey! Aahh! What you talking, bitch? Okay, good buddy, see you in 48 hours. [CAR ENGINE REVS] That's it. These specifications are written in Italian. It's going to take us a couple days at least just to translate them. But judging from the drawings, it looks revolutionary. I want that engine done in time for next weekend. And I want no excuses. MAN: Come here, Carl, let me buy you a beer. CARL: Maybe I'll let you. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS] Al! Where's Bud and Walt? Dancing. GIRL: We'll wait for you here! Come on, we're all alone out here, let's go for a ride. Jenny... That's the car. Jenny, hey, Jenny, come on, out. Right now! No way.Out! After that, you'll have to throw me out. Okay, have it your way. JENNY: Al, what are we doing? Following that car. That's the one I was chasing up at the track. Hey, they just turned up that dirt road. That must be where they're keeping her. Well, let's surprise 'em. Go and kick their asses... Shut up, Squeak. Why not? I'm as tough as any of you guys. Yeah, right. Come on. What'd you get? Uh, some chicken, some rice, a few beans. You were bein' kinda hard on her old man, didn't ya? You know the reason I done that, don't you? Huh? So Sheriff McGruffy wouldn't find out about that money. Else he'll want his share, too. I wouldn't worry about McGruffy. Duplain's got him in his pocket already. Now, what you need to think about... Is what we gonna do with that two million bucks when Enrico comes up with it. And what we gonna do if he don't come up with it. I don't think we gotta worry about that. [WHISPERS] Okay, let's go. ♪ Let's get down to the heart of the matter ♪ Would you do it for the money ♪ Hold on. Al! Hey, look, we'll just be a minute. All right, no more than five, now. Thanks. Walt, hey, I need your help. What the hell are you doing, man? Look, we found her.Who? The girl that was kidnapped. JENNY: That's right, we saw her, she's tied up. Great, Al, call the cops. We can't. Sheriff McGruffy's in on it, we heard them. Come on, guys, this is a good song. Walt, I'm telling you, this girl... Hey, hey, hey. You blew Saturday night. Just lay off, all right? [LAUGHING] Woo, hoo.You heard her. What are you guys? Chicken? ♪ Would you do it for the money Would you do it for a piece of $2 million? ♪ Let's get down to the heart of the matter ♪ Would you do it for the money ♪ Well? What's this about $2 million? That's what the kidnappers are asking for. So if we rescue her, more than likely there will be a reward or something. How much? I don't know. Say 5%. 5% of $2 million? Right. That's a hundred... ALL: Thousand dollars. A hundred thousand? Hey, yo brother, dance with her, will ya? Good idea. Hey, pal, step in for me, would ya? I'll be right back, honey. DARRYL: Now, what about her? Ain't we even gonna sample this little bitch? Well, that's a toss up between you and me as to who goes first. Come here. And seeing how she don't like neither damn one of us too good, I reckon we'll just have to cut the cards for her. JOEL: $2 million is a lot of money for your old man to come up with, ain't it? I hope he doesn't. You better hope he does, 'cause if he don't, you and me are gonna have a little party. Just the two of us. Sounds like Kenny's Trans Am. Take her upstairs, and keep her quiet. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] Ohh! No, leave me alone! No use fighting, bitch. We cut for you, and I won. Walt? Can you and Bud take out those two? We'll sure as hell try. This is your last 500 from Vince. After the race, you two are on your own, you never heard of us. And I wouldn't get any ideas, if I were you. Vince has a lot of friends. Uh-huh. [LEAVES RUSTLE] You hear something? You're getting paid, you look. Psst. AL: Bud! Help him! I'm goin' in! Oh-ah! KENNY: They're after the girl, damn it! Come on, the house is burning, we gotta get her out. Well, let 'em burn. ANDREA: [SCREAMING] No, no, no! JENNY: Walt! Are you all right?Yes. Can you walk?Yes. Holy shit, this place is on fire! Jenny! Al's got her! Let's go! KENNY: Get the gun out of the trunk! [SHOTGUN COCKS] Come on, you can out drive this boy! He's got a shotgun! Duck! ALL: Woo-hoo! We did it! We did it! Hey, you see what happens when we work like a team? Yeah, for a change. We are gonna be rich! A hundred thousand dollars! We are gonna kick ass at Charlotte. You got that right. Jen, there's Coke in the fridge. Al, when you get the money, you got no excuses, you gotta take me out.Woo! She's so pushy. So I begin to understand, my gallant rescuers are nothing but another band of thieves, yes? Hey, wait a minute, lady, we ain't crooks. You sound like crooks. Look, I'm grateful, really I am. You saved my life. But I'm listening to what you're saying about money. What makes you think there's a difference? Well, there is, we're on your side, right? Yeah, of course we are. Look, my name's Al. It's nice to meet you. This is Jenny. And these are two of my pals. This is Walt and Bud. I would like to go to the police and tell them that I am safe. Sheriff McGruffy is in on the party with them. This whole thing has become a nightmare. Nightmare? There could be a sheriff involved. We could all be in deep shit. Look, we was hoping we'd get a reward for saving you. Believe me, lady, if we didn't need the money, I doubt we would have done it. See what I mean? You just want to make money off me... Like crooks.Yeah, you put it that way, and it does sound bad. But we're not crooks, we're a racing team. That's what we do, we race stock cars. I don't know if that means anything to you, but if it does, you know that it costs money. Yeah, I mean, he was the one who chased you out of the track. Wrecked our car. WALT: Yeah, we damn near lost our sponsor. Hey, now wait a minute, guys, the fact is, we would have done it anyway, even without a reward. Right? That's all there is to it. My name is Andrea. Andrea. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to call my father in Italy. Don't worry, I'll call... ALL: Collect! Collect. [WOMAN SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Hey, speak English. I'm sorry. No, they've not been arrested, but they've stolen my designs. You are not to move until I get there. I am on the way to the airport. Papa, if I don't get back my designs, they'll make a fortune out of our technology. We have too much invested in this. Listen to me, Andrea, it won't be safe for you, you understand? I'm sorry, please understand I have friends, I am not alone. I have to go now, mi amore, papa. Ciao. Andrea? Andrea? Here you go, Dupe. What the hell happened to you? Vince, your farmhouse just went up in flames. Burned to the ground. Burned to the ground? How? Someone started a fire. The girl got away. Whoa... What girl? Kenny... I give you something real easy to do, and you mess it up. Now, if you don't find that girl, we're all gonna do time. What girl? [CHUCKLES] You... You two kill me. The girl we got the plans from. The boys had to snatch her. Duplain, you're even dumber than I thought. Well, if you want your share of the pie, you better help us find her. And fast! That's what I like about you, Dupe, you're so damn lovable. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] Morning. Come on, Andy, time to eat. Thanks, I'm not hungry. And don't call me Andy. Want some coffee? What I would love is a cappuccino. A cup of what? Cappuccino... It's coffee. Espresso and steamed milk. Oh, yeah... Cappuccino. It's good. Well, all I got is instant coffee, but we have real milk. Forget the coffee. So... What were you doing out at the speedway? Just business. Look, eh... I have an idea. You need money, yes? Who doesn't? Those men stole my engine designs, and I want them back. Wait a minute. Engine? Will you do it? Forget it lady, we just got you out of one hell of a mess, no way we're going back there. Besides, if those plans are in that farmhouse, they're probably cinders by now. No, one of the men took them away. Look, if you help me get them back, I guarantee you'll have enough money to repair your car, race it, and a lot more. How are you going to guarantee it? Put your body up for collateral? Jen, I was just coming in to wake you up. Better give your mom a call and let her know that you're still here. How's your neck doing, kid? Doing just fine, thanks, and don't call me "kid." [EXASPERATED] Women... I want you to take me back to my hotel. I've been wearing these clothes for three days now. I want to take them off. And have a decent bath, please. ANDREA: Tell me, how long have you been racing? AL: Eight years. Since Theo took me in. That's a long time. Well, I've had a couple of set-backs. Never had the money or crew to get it all together. Bud and Walt, they've joined me lately. They work for nothing. But we all have the same goals. The hardest thing is to find decent sponsors. Every racer I've ever known says the same thing. How many's that? Enough to know that you are all a little bit crazy in the head. Must be tough being a rich man's daughter. Just what does he do? For one thing, he employs race car drivers. Excuse me, I've got to get my key. Maybe you aren't so different from the others after all. Willing to take a risk if there's something in it for you? Tell you the honest truth, I meant it. I would have come after you even if there wasn't a penny in it. ANDREA: Then you'll help me? Yeah, any time after the race, I'm yours. That's too late. Whomever has them can... Please. ...modify their engines according to the blueprints, and then the next thing you know, years of work will be wasted. What about your father, can't he help? He's more concerned with my safety than with the blueprints. It's up to us to find them before it's too late. Like I said, any time after the race. Hey. I told you not to come back here until you found her. Vince, what are you sweating about? We got the plans. Nobody can finger you unless I open my mouth. Don't you push me. You better just hope that McGruffy finds her first. Where's Joel and Darryl? They split after the fire, but don't worry, if I need them, I can find them. Get out of my way. I got some thinking to do. [SHOWER RUNNING]ANDREA: If you want the shower, I'll be out soon. Um, no thanks. took one yesterday. What did you say? I said I'm going to take one later today. Tell me, do you find America much different from Italy? Yes, very different. There is much more freedom here, especially for a young woman. [SHOWER STOPS RUNNING] And men there take showers every day. In Italy, we always try to make time for the nicer things when it is important enough. Even if you do not believe me, I am grateful to you. You are my friend and I thank you for that. Welcome to America. [ENGINE ROARING] How's it look? [CHUCKLING] Hey, look, Duke. If this stuff holds together under real racing conditions, we've got ourselves a winner. We're still pulling the same revs, right? But we're using 20% less fuel to do it. You figure it out. We could get away with one, maybe two, less pit stops a race. And if Kenny squirts in the nitrous, we could be in the money. The big money. What if they find out about it? They could run our asses right off the track. Besides, those new heads are paper thin. You could blow that car to kingdom come. You let me worry about it. Hey boss, look what we found at the farmhouse. Want us to take care of it? What are you talking about? Your car, boss. Kenny, get your ass over here! What the hell happened the other night? Don't give me any bullshit. Vince, I already told you. Somebody set fire to the farmhouse, ran me off the road. Who was it? If I knew that, I'd tell you. All I saw was a brown Chevy pick-up, '78 I think. Why didn't you tell me that sooner? You didn't ask. McGruffy here. McGruffy, this is Duplain. I got something for you. I sure hope so, we haven't been able to come up with anything. She was picked up by a guy with a brown '78 Chevy truck. And there should be some scratches along the driver's side. All right, Dupe, I'll take care of it. [SIREN STARTS] I believe that pick-up is connected with that stock car that chased you off the track. Get a hold of Joel and Darryl. I want you guys pounding the pavement and searching every shop until you run her down. Do we understand each other? Vince, I believe it's time you woke up and smelled the coffee. I don't work for you anymore. I work for me. We became partners the day you hired those goons to steal those blueprints. So I'll be glad to help, but not for you... For me... Partner. Theo. I want you to meet Andrea. Theo Jennings. He taught me everything I need to know about racing. Well, Al's got a way with words. Almost as good as his driving. How do you do?How do you do? Italiano? Si. [COMPLIMENTING IN ITALIAN] [THANKING IN ITALIAN] So what's all that? A compliment. I had no idea you could speak Italian. WALT: Whoo-heee! What'cha all dolled up for, girl? Hey, Jenny's got legs. Knock it off. According to the magazines, this is the latest fashion. Jenny, the only magazine you read is Circle Track. Let me show you this car. AL: You look good, Jennifer. All right, the oil leak's fixed. Let's check it out. Okay, take her out. Will you hold onto this? Theo, why doesn't she just eat pizza and get fat like the rest of them? KNOTHEAD: Theo! Theo, listen, Sphinx wants his car back. He saw the parts bill and he came undone. And that's not all, the police came by the shop this afternoon and they're looking for a truck that sounds a lot like Al's. Let's confuse them, put the pick-up plates on the Pontiac. What do you have in mind, Theo? I want to get you and Andrea out of town as quick as we can. You two go pack while me and the boys go to the Sphinx's and work on the car. Well, shoot, Theo, you know you can't put a stock car on the street. Want to bet? Knothead, you go get some paint and meet us here as quick as you can. All right.Wait a minute. Is anyone interested in how I feel about the decisions you are making? For your information, I'm not going anywhere except after my plans. Andrea, now it's not just Al whose life is in danger here. It's yours too. Trust me. You gotta get out of here. THEO: Knothead, what color did you get? KNOTHEAD: Red primer. That's subtle. Don't forget, you're still in the running. Right. I'll be in touch by phone. I think you're gonna like Dixie's place. Me too.Great. You know where the key is?Yep. All right, you make a mess, it's my neck. Have fun. Okay, you did a good job, guys. Let's get out of here before Sphinx shows up. Knothead, you come with me. Why you boys here so early? Are you turning over some kind of new leaf? [CHUCKLES] This is very good. Very good! Detail those cars. ANDREA: Whoever has my blueprints will modify their engine by Saturday. AL: What makes you so sure? Because I could transform this engine in less time than it took you to paint it. Look, Theo promised to call when it's all clear. You boys looking for something? A little information. Haven't I seen you somewhere before? Around the race track? I ain't never seen you before in my life. Lookin' for a girl, thought she might be hangin' out with that young friend of yours. What's his name? Lives out here, don't he? Don't have no young friends. Oh, come on, man, now, make it easy on yourself. Now where is he? Who? Now, we ain't gonna waste anymore time, now are we? I don't know. I mean, I got more time than you turkeys got brains. Aahh! Aahh! Yeah, get that watch. ANDREA: Who's Dixie? AL: She's an old flame of Theo's. They've been together ever since I've known him. Why don't they get married? I don't know. I think Theo likes it this way. Have you ever thought of getting married? No. Hey, this might be the dude... Al Pagura. Let me see that thing. Why save it? He ain't gonna be racing anymore, is he? [CHUCKLES] Naw.Let's get out of this dump. Becky, get me another one of these, will ya, honey? RADIO: Best country, WSOC FM 103, Charlotte, North Carolina. It's 5:00, and this is Ed Robertson... Well, well, well, well, well... I thought you boys had disappeared to some desert island, someplace. Yeah, well, we need the financial do-with first. [CHUCKLES] Ha, more money, huh? Well, it may come as a surprise to you, but you two are on my shit list! First, you get me a girl I don't want and then you lose her. And I'm supposed to pay you? We got the plans for ya, huh? And now we got the name of the kid who took her. Pagura... Al Pagura. Where have I heard that name before? Out on the race track. His manager almost recognized us. Some bum named Theo. Theo Jennings? Shit! Shit! You two are dragging in every fool in Charlotte. No one is supposed to be knowing what we're doing here. We're taking too many risks. Come on, Dupe, you're in the racing business, and you're worried about a risk? [CHUCKLES] Sitting on the fence ain't gonna do nothing but stick a post up your ass. Now, the only way out of this is for us to get that girl back and ransom her off to that million dollar daddy over there in Italy. You try any funny business with Enrico Lombardo, and you're dead.

He's still asleep. What is it, Theo? Look, those guys that kidnapped you they know who Al is. And they're not being gentlemen about it. I just want to tell you, so you can stay sharp and keep low. Do you know who they are? Did you see them? I'm not really sure, but I think one of them used to hang around with Vince Duplain. Who is that "Duplain"? Oh, he's just some bad-ass guy who used to... I'll bet it's Duplain who's got your engine plans. Thanks, Theo, I'll tell Al. Good morning. Morning. Andrea, what is it? It's just so lovely here, and such a mess back there. But we have to leave now. Leave? Where do you think we're going? Remember, you promised? When the race is over, that's what I promised. So you lied to me last night. Andrea, I've waited a long time to run Charlotte. Now, they'll be guys in that race who will put me up against that wall without even thinking twice about it. I'm sorry. I've just been so involved in my own problems. Don't even give it a second thought. I'll tell you what... Let's go for a swim, Andy. Great. You go, and I'll catch up. Okay. Good morning. [SPLASH]Whoo! [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Andrea! [SIREN] [SIREN] "Al Pagura?" Stolen tags... 95... Come on, car, slow down, slow down before you hurt somebody. ♪ My heart's on fire ♪ My heart's on fire ♪ My heart's on fire ♪ My heart's on fire Lady, you get the hell out of that car right now and put your hands on the roof. Hurry up, come on, lady. You heard me. I said get out of that car and put your hands on the roof. This is a damn stock car! You carrying any concealed weapons, ma'am? No! Listen, I ran the computer, the license comes back to a pick-up belonging to an Al Pagura. Gentlemen, I'm Sheriff McGruffy, I got a standing warrant for this suspect. Girl, don't you know you're not supposed to take this kind of car out on the road? Officer, he's lying, this man is dangerous. Uh-hum, she's been drinking again. I have not been drinking! You're not gonna get away with it that easily this time. Trooper, does that warrant square with you?Looks good to me. Would you do me a great favor and put her in the back of my car for me, please? Officer, don't leave me with him! No! Trooper, I think it would be a good idea to impound this vehicle, don't you think? Sounds good to me. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.Sure thing. Thanks a lot for the ride! My pleasure. What happened? I called, she said you were asleep. Didn't want to wake you. What happened to you? Couple of clowns came in here looking for you. They asked some hard questions. Took my Rollie. You talked to Andrea? Mm-hm, didn't she tell ya? No. She took the Pontiac and left me stranded in the middle of that lake. Theo, I think we better get you to a hospital. You don't look too good. Don't worry about me, I'm gonna be fine. What? I bet I know where she went. Duplain's. I hope she doesn't find him. Let's get Bud and Walt. Hey, boys, look what I found... An Italian chick. Where's Dupe? Well, this couldn't have come at a more perfect time. Duplain and Kenny done took off for the speedway. There ain't no reason why we shouldn't collect all that money now. Well, I got a big appetite, I sure don't want to cut that pie in any more pieces than necessary. Where do you want to put her? Just stick her in Duplain's office and gag her. All right, come on, girl.[ANDREA SPEAKS IN ITALIAN] Now, I just want you to calm down, be quiet, and behave yourself, you understand me? Please, don't do this. Now, don't you forget... I won the cut. We gotta get in touch with her old man. The sooner we pull this thing off, the better. Please, let me go. If we give her back, how we gonna keep her quiet? It don't make no difference. By that time, we'll all be in the Caribbean with the money. Then the cops come and pick up Duplain and Kenny. [BOTH LAUGH WICKEDLY] Hi, may I help you? I'm Enrico Lombardo, and my daughter, Andrea, she's staying here. I believe she left a message for you. There you are. Thank you. "Jennings?" Theo Jennings? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Thank you, very much. I swore I heard something. No, you didn't hear nothin' you been drinkin' your bathwater again. Oh, get off my ass. AL: Hey, these must be her plans. WALT: Forget about them now, we're here for the car. Let's find the main shop. Hey, there's a door over here. [JOEL AND DARRYL SPEAKING] [LOUD CRASH] What was that? Al, watch it! [SHOTGUN BLAST] Ugh! That's my Rollie. Argh! AL: Jenny! Enrico! Behind you! What are you doing here? Jenny brought us here from your shop. Where is my daughter? Ask that guy in the hat! Where is my daughter? Over there, in the office. Come on, let's get out of here! You all right? Yes, thank you. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Enrico, you were the last guy I expected to see. Yes, it's nice to see you again, Theo. Bud, get the car will you? You bet. I believe these belong to you. My plans. Rescuing you could get to be habit. Thank you. I love you. Ow.Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, where's the car? Yeah, Andrea, where is the car? Al, darling, it's... What?It's not here, The police... They were chasing me and there was an accident. The car is a little hurt. What do you mean, a little hurt? Not much, just a little, but it's gone. The police... They took it away. I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to happen. Didn't mean for it to happen? No.Oh, come on, Andrea, I'm beginning to see the light, you've been using me. You have been using all of us to get what it was you wanted. Thanks very much, lady. You did it to us, royally. Hey, Al, come here, come here. Let's get her dad to help us like we planned. It's too late. Papa, I had no choice. It was the only way to get back the plans. It wasn't the only way, it was your way. It was an accident, I didn't mean to wreck it. You wrecked more than just his car. What do you mean? Well, I got the feeling you were becoming more than friends. Yesterday, I thought so too, but now, I don't know. For 10 years, you liked engines the way other girls liked boys. I told you to go out more. Now I see... I should have insisted. Papa, should I go to him? No, not right now, he doesn't want anything from you, and frankly, I don't blame him. Maybe later. Buonanotte. Buonanotte, Papa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Landruff has just turned in the fastest clock. You suddenly changed the way you drive, or what? This car's never gone that fast before. I'm telling you, this engine likes to run. I'm comin' out of the corners so fast it makes my eyes water. It's dry as a bone. PAUL: It's a lean burn, all right. I'll tell you what... It smells like a winner. [LAUGHS] ANNOUNCER: Here is the next qualifier, Darryl Walters, driving the number 17 Budweiser colonial red Pontiac. Hi, Theo, how you doing? Haven't seen you for quite awhile. What happened to you? It looks like somebody got the best of you.Yeah, something like that. You look like you got something on your mind. What is it? I've got this kid. Yeah, I hear that you've got a hot young driver. Well, he wrecked his car last week after qualifying. It wasn't even his fault. That's what makes it bad. What it's coming down to is... If we don't race the big one this week... We're finished. I need some help. Sounds like you need a new car. That's it. Hey, Bud... Check it out. Okay, what do you think? She's a beauty, isn't she? Great, Theo, where'd you get it? Hey, you mean the Silver Fox gave us this car?You bet. Come on, the engine needs some work, let's get her off. Well, this is not gonna win a race unless every car breaks before the end. THEO: Well, we'll fix it. Yeah, well, we got too much to do, and no time to do it. I'll tell you what I think... I think we ought to get the Italian broad's old man, get him to cough up the money for a new engine. Her again? Well, Walt is right. They owe us. And it's up to you, Al, to go get it for us. You got us into this, now you get us out. I'd rather eat dirt. You know, pride's like oysters... Hard to learn to swallow. As long as it's just her old man I gotta deal with. Okay, so what do I ask him for? Okay, I've been thinking. Maybe there is something to Andrea's plans after all. Now, if we could just get her over here to help us... We could...No way, Theo. No way! The whole time I was with her, I couldn't think of anything else. Hurts, don't it? It sure does, I'm paying for it now. Look, forget the other car, this is our car, it's got no strings attached to it. It takes pros to fix one up in a day, Theo. And we are not pros. We'll get one. How about a cute Italian who likes cappuccino? Ha! Fat chance. Let me try and tell you something... This is our last chance to get out of here and onto the super tracks. You blow it now... You're never gonna put it back together. You're already sounding like a loser. Damn it, Theo! I am not a loser. Well, prove it. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] I didn't expect to see you again. Yesterday, you were the last person I wanted to see. Well, I got a new car. You did! You're going to be able to race? Well, the engine needs a lot of work. My father said he'll do everything he can to help you. It's not your father we need, it's you. I'm sorry, I've got business to take care of. I'm leaving. No, you can't do that, you owe us too much. I told you, my father is willing to buy you a car for your race. Well, that's not good enough. Yes, it is. You rescued me for money, that's what you're getting. Well, it all boils down to a nice, neat proposition for you every time, doesn't it, Andy? As far as you're concerned, I'm just another spare part. You keep blaming me for wrecking everything! I was forced to do what I did! Forced? Yes, because you wouldn't help me until the race was over! So don't tell me I owe you anything! You got what you wanted, didn't you? Oh, you didn't give me anything you didn't want to. Hey... What's the matter with you two? You sound like a couple of Italian lovers. Well, I'm part Italian, and that part's telling me to get the hell out of here. Ciao. Andrea tells me you're a big racing man in Europe, is that right? Yes, I am. You don't like to lose, do you? No. Well, I don't either. And without her, I don't have anything! Ah! I don't believe I just said that. Um, I suppose you know what you're doing? I learned something in six years of engineering school. 7-2-300... I need it yesterday. Take this and polish those ports, and make sure all the edges are smooth. Just what is this supposed to do for us, anyway? With any luck, give us much better mileage and less pit stops. Here you go.Thank you. Cappuccino! Grazie. Prego. You know, with heads like this, you're gonna have to go with a smaller cam. That means less horsepower. No, because we found a way to delay the intake opening rate. That's dumb! Now you won't be able to pack more air into them cylinders. With these profiles, we will! Bullshit. Taking our chances with this, aren't we? That's what it's all about. I, uh, never had a female mechanic before. What about Jenny? Well, that's not the same. Whoa! We're not going to get finished this way. Oh, come on, Andy, Rome wasn't built in a day. Oh, so much you know about my country, in such a short time. Mmm. Now, go back to work. This engine's ready.

Andrea thinks Al is a driver with much promise. Well... She's right. KENNY: What the hell is he doing here? McGruffy told me that car was impounded. Well, I reckon we're gonna have to race them. Ain't gonna be no race. This car runs the way it has, we're gonna walk all over them. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. All right, gentlemen. Good luck. ANNOUNCER: Making his first attempt on the superspeedway, car number 61, Al Pagura, in the "Born to Race" Pontiac. Hey, penny for your thoughts. I've been waiting for this all my life. Me too. ANNOUNCER: In the Henderson Hardware Pontiac, it'll be Kenny Landruff... [ANNOUNCER CONTINUES][ENGINES REVVING] Duplain! I have two scores to settle with you... My daughter, and the plans. I don't know what you're talking about. We're just developing our own technology, the same as every racer, hereabouts. You're not gonna snake out of this like you did last time, Duplain. There you go again, blaming me. With every step I take, it reminds me of that death trap you put me in. There was nothing wrong with the car. The official swore that you saw the flag. That means you should have slowed down immediately. I never saw it, and you told us to drive as hard as we could. I was there, Duplain, I saw the flag as plain as day, and you drove straight into the back of me. Get out of here. The both of you. I don't drive for your family anymore, damn it. It's too bad those boys didn't give it to your daughter... Southern-style! Hold it, buddy! [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] That's your best shot? [SHOUTING] Now, you'll see mine! ANNOUNCER: All drivers, report to your cars, please. Hey, Pagura... I'm gonna settle this today. I wouldn't do that, it might be hazardous to your health. I'm gonna tell you something, wiseass, you watch out for that wall out there, 'cause I'm gonna make you part of it. Don't take it onto the track, we'll settle this after the race. Out there... You're mine. ANNOUNCER: Drivers, report to your cars, immediately, race time, two minutes. [ANNOUNCER INDISCERNIBLE] In second place, Al Pagura in the number 61 car. Landruff and Pagura are the only two cars making one pit stop. Pagura right on the tail of car 13, Kenny Landruff. Kenny, doggone it! Pagura's on your ass! Now move it! Damn it. This engine's got no more top end. ANNOUNCER: They're bumper to bumper. Trying to move to the lead, Al Pagura in car number 61. Here's your new leader, doing it the hard way up and around the outside. Bitch, get off my ass! ANNOUNCER: The leader against the wall in track 3. Back in the lead, car 13, Kenny Landruff. Has he got enough gas? I think he'll finish, but on the fumes in the tank. Pagura, having hit the wall, has repositioned and is moving up to third! Andrea, can we make it on the tank? It will be close. The air flows been upset by the crash. Pagura down the straight. He's flying. We have seven laps to go. Can he make it, Andrea? AL: Theo, I can take him. Yeah, you may be pushing the car across the line. So, I'll push it. THEO: Andrea, I need an answer now. He has to come in. Al, pit after the next lap. But I've got...Pit! ANNOUNCER: Coming down, out of control... The right side is gas. Kenny, come on in here, we'll do the car. Get me that yellow if you can. You got it, boss. ANNOUNCER: ...misses the wall and spins into the in-field. We got a fire. We're ready. Come on, let's get it right! ANNOUNCER: Now with only five laps to go, we are under the yellow. Everybody is jumping at the chance to take advantage of that yellow flag. In the first three positions, Kenny Landruff, Geoff Bodine and Al Pagura. CREW: Let's move. Come on, come on! How does she feel? Loose. Very loose. Let's go, come on! Knothead, check the back and... I'm going to blow his brains out. Go! Go! go! Come on! We beat him! We haven't won yet. ANNOUNCER: With only three more laps to go we have a new leader. As they head out, gears to the grind... The white flag is out. Come on, push it, push it. Get that bastard. Get him. Get that bastard. ANNOUNCER: Pagura coming into the pass. As Pagura sets back in, setting up the slingshot. Once he breaks the air flow, there isn't a soul in the world that can touch him. Hit it now.
