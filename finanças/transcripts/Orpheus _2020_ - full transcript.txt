Come to me, all of you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11:28. Love is a sacrifice. Even the food is sacrificed. Love is the mist of the soul. Why don't you make me disappear? Love... Love... Love... Love... Love is a sacrifice. There is love when you are here. Love... Why don't you make me disappear? Love... Why doesn't it go away? Love... Quiet. I better do it. Thanks. "Steel". Do you want some? Let's split it up. Look what I found yesterday. It's from when I was studying. There are Artem labels. You see it? I found it under the table. "Moscow speaks and presents". You wrote it? Yes. It was an agenda that I had. There's something weird going on there. They are burning something. I wanted to show you something. Do you remember this notebook? Yesterday I wrote a note here. Look at her. It's what we did when Anya turned 16, remember? She was thinking... That was life! It was. Yes. Seems like yesterday we had fun together. "In all beginnings." You wrote it, do you remember? You had another letter. You wrote: "love and success in all beginnings." This is your handwriting exactly. Do you want to eat more? This? It's okay. This is horrible. If you want we can stop. Why? I don't know. Check it out. ORPHEUS A FILM BY VADIM KOSTROV Sponsored by the production company Mal de mer. Love is a sacrifice. Even the food is sacrificed. Love is a battle against evil. A moment of weakness. It's all backwards. Love is my weakness. Leave my soul defenseless. In a stone forest. Love is the mist of the soul. Why don't you make me disappear? Love... Love... Love... Love... Love smells like you. Love is a sacrifice. There is love when you are here. Love... why don't you make me disappear? Love... We go around the world. Without worrying about time. We will rest where we are. And eat what we have. A theater stage, for travelers like us. Made from freshly cut boards. Curtains held by nails. We are traveling artists. We are always on the move. A car in an open field. It is our regular home. We are great artists. But friendly and down to earth. We are musicians and singers. Acrobats and buffoons. Ready. Care. The mosquitoes are coming. They are attracted to light. When will you go? I don't know. I have to leave at the end of August. Why at the end of August? I'm not sure. Maybe at the beginning of September. I don't know. I have to... do it all over again. Everything. Because I'm preparing for the new film «Oedipus». I think it will be a good movie. You didn't like it, did you? You do not like me. No, I took note of a couple of moments, but overall... Yes, it is... They are working is that, right? Yes, it is a sketch of the first part. We are doing it all over again. Yes, because we are here, we are seen, we exist. We need to say that we are alive, we can do something today, right? If we don't, we are not existing. Don't you think? Because now everything depends on if we are real and... Do you believe in fate? What do you mean by that? Destination? Yes, the human mission, what we come here to do. Yes, the mission exists, just like destiny. Don't you think it changes every day, hour, minute, with every action? With every mistake and decision. You will always have an address. I think... So it doesn't matter what you do? It's not that, that's false. It's a lie. This is what Oedipus is about. What was he doing? He was against fate. Have you read the book? Yes. Good. I speak of Fate in Ancient Greece. There were other gods. And no matter what he did or tried to escape. He continues to have sex with his mother and kills his father. But now we are living in a different age. And now I understand that destiny does not exist. And Oedipus is about a fight with destiny that doesn't exist. There are things that do not really exist. They're like the rails, you know? People are just used to rolling. People, especially in small towns, live like they're on rails. They work fast everywhere. I think you exaggerate. Yes, it's exaggerated, it is. I'm just saying that you have to free yourself, stop deciding and let it flow. As people say: "Go with the flow." Stay on the rails. They don't really exist. And each of your thoughts can truly change your life. It's just that people don't know it and can't change because of it. Just an idea to buy a train ticket to somewhere and travel, that's all. You can sell or give away everything and leave. There is always an option, even if you have nothing. It's like in Viktor Tsoi's song: «People who have nothing to hope for, go the way. "They are the ones who are saved, the ones who are saved." «And those who go home. Sweet dreams." "Sweet dreams and good night." And many people choose to sleep. For my part, I believe that your ideas and actions shape your future. In ten minutes, in 20 years, it doesn't matter. I only mean the determined form. That is his greatest predisposition for life. Yes, I think so too. I think we're meant to meet certain people. As in our case. Yes. It was kind of like fate, yeah. Yes, exactly. It was something like that. Because it was supposed... it was going to happen. It's true. There are many things we don't know, do you understand? We don't know what will happen tomorrow. But it turns out... It was already known that we would sit here and now when we were 21 years old. It was necessary to move on. But we couldn't know. That is why life is so interesting to us. It is interesting to watch the movie until the end. Do not you believe it? Sometimes people make decisions without thinking and then say: "I'm not interested anymore". "I already know what is coming and it tires me." And at that point, they give up. I believe in destiny. I never thought that I would be able to be a filmmaker after all. I think. I think it was a coincidence of events. But coincidence does not form out of thin air. What does that mean? You really only have one mission and everyone has one, for sure. The mosquitos... I'll turn it on, I'll turn it on Everyone must choose whether to act or not, whether they want to or not. It depends on ourselves. Because we are lucky to choose. That's great. You don't have to stay on the rails. We really can choose. We can go there. We can go or stay. It doesn't turn on. Matches run out. Matches run out. Fine. Wait. - It is impossible. - Why? How can it be? The fuse came to an end. - What's inside? - Nothing. It's over. We have to go. How did that happen? Was over. That happen. We no longer have light. We can bury it under the plinth. You read this book? "Bury me under the plinth", will it be from Pelevin? I didn't read it, and you? Yes. And what did you think? It is interesting reading, talks about different things. It is bad? I don't believe it. Why? It's about what families are. There are people who grow in denial and aggression. - Yes, without being loved. - Yes. Take many photos at once. You finished? Done, thanks, you're great. The «Scriptonite» design is ready. I respect you, Vadik. The heart dissolves in our love. Give the best of ourselves. What are our dreams for? I am like a bird that in the distance, he is afraid of heights, as he flies towards you. I will leave everything for you. Our son has your eyes. Yes, the same eyes in which he drowned me. When we both forget everything. I can be quiet, but I want to shout it all out. I breathe you, I have nothing to hide. I can't sleep in the quiet of the night. I can be quiet, but I want to shout it all out. I breathe you, I have nothing to hide. I can't sleep in the quiet of the night. Thoughts of love fly in my head. I know it's not a coincidence, we have a secret in our life. For a moment we were together in the same universe. I don't drown, but I breathe, I take your love with me. And fly with you to the end of the world. I know when we're together with hundreds of stars above us. Its brilliance should illuminate our path. I do not drown, but I breathe, not noticing any superfluous noise. Fly with you to the end of the world.

And in comparison, my parents had a feeling of visitors. They did not feel comfortable. And I wish we were still married. Not. Heavens! Just listen to me. We are not the first Europeans to come here. The proof is a tombstone with an inscription in Spanish. With a female name. I don't know who this woman was or how she got here. On the stone was written: "Aurelia 1715." It's a prank? She couldn't leave her alone. Then I decided to bury them on this beautiful hill... Hello. Valya, are you in bed? Not yet, I'm awake. I see. I wanted to see how you were. I'm busy here too.

Why am I in this state, in this nirvana? Why am I in this state, in this nirvana? This nirvana excites me. We switch knees. On knees... On knees... This nirvana covers me and closes my languid eyes. This nirvana excites me. We switch knees. On knees... To be alone forever. To be alone forever. But why? Why can't I yell at you? Can't. Miss you. Your smile goes into the sea. I'm drowning.

A tear will run down my cheek. Tired of humility. A tear will run down my cheek. I wave him away with a wave of my hand. I smile in response to all problems. And against all odds burst with a sincere smile. Sometimes I find it funny. Sometimes it is the other way around. I know that joking with fate is a sin. We will stay at the gate. Tired of humility. A tear will run down my cheek. I wave him away with a wave of my hand. I don't want to lose happiness or evil. I know myself, but I can't understand myself. Forgive me if you can, I beg you.
