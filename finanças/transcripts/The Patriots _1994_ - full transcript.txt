THE PATRIOTS No real persons or events are depicted in this work of fiction You can't stop here. - Why? - Security. Clear off. - Hey, our car broke down. - Clear off! - What's the matter? - Car problem. They're lying. - What's he on about? - Quiet. You. Clear off. Go to the other side. Let's take them in. - Go on. - OK, I'm going. Car 32 calling central. We've 2 suspects. - What's your name? - Ariel Brenner. What? - Quiet! - He asked a question! Quiet! Your name! Don't you have better things to do? Quiet! Stop it! Stop it! Stop, damn it! Why were you by the minister's house? I told you: the car broke down! You're lying. Talk, or I'll break your arms! OK. Next. Move it! No. Please. It was a test for the Mossad! We had to watch that house. It was a test. Call the Mossad. Your buddy telling the truth? No. Next time, don't lie to us! See how antsy that makes us? Our apologies! Happy Birthday to you Our sincerest wishes May these few flowers bring you happiness - Happy Birthday to you - Cut it out! Come on, blow! Go ahead and tell them. What's the matter? What have you done now? - You got kicked out of school? - No. Come on, tell us. What's happening? I'm leaving for Israel. The Jewish Agency's paying for my trip. Congratulations. What will you do there? You can't understand. You're assimilated. Idiot! Here, happy birthday! With my initials... Now you can smoke in the desert, you idiot. I'll have to practice. Dear Laurence, I've haven't written much from Israel. Now you've stopped complaining. I'm glad, since all I wrote in 4 years was fake. Israel too has a dark side. Here is what I'm doing. My name is Pinhas. I've a few details for you. Forget the word "Mossad". Never use it again. It doesn't exist. Your family will know you don't work in a bank or a factory. Say you're working for national security. If you're asked questions, answer. Elementary rule. Silence is always suspicious. Answer, but lie. If they ask about the colour of our walls, say they're gray or blue. They're all yours. By the way, the thing everyone says about me, about how I ripped the balls off a guy I was interrogating... It's not true. See you around! - Who are you? - Yuri. - Yuri what? - Yuri Eisenbach. How can we get along if you lie on the first question? My name really is Eisenbach. So I write Eisenbach? As you wish. My name is Eisenbach. I need to put the candidate's name here so I can identify him later. So I write Eisenbach? I don't understand. You don't? The exercise hasn't started yet, idiot! What exercise? I don't believe it! Why do they send me morons like you? OK. It's the lying test. But I need your name to grade you! I'll give you one last chance. Answer me carefully. Pay attention. Your name is? Yuri Eisenbach. OK, I'll put down Eisenbach. The exercise starts now. What's your name? Your name? Yuri Eisenbach. OK, we'll leave it there. You don't understand what it's about. It's over. Bye! Now that you failed, you don't give a shit anymore, right? So tell me your name. Your real name. Yuri Eisenbach. Get out of here, fast! Here is the exercise: You'll approach someone. You've 15 minutes to find out his name, address, job and as much of his life as you can. Get him to meet you somewhere. You can make up any story, I don't care. As long as he doesn't get suspicious. That guy. With the paper. Fifteen minutes only. Then write a detailed report. And no lies! Go on. Are you French? - No. - Sorry, my mistake. - Sorry, I 'm not French. - Me neither. But I was born there and often go back to work there. What line are you in? Know what you're gonna do? Go and tell your Mossad friends to stop bothering me. What are you talking about? You're nuts! Paranoid! Not bad, not bad... You did what you should, without falling apart. Call me Oron. You were on a recruitment exercise for Barak and Pinhas, right? Right now, there's a guy sunning himself by the pool. Old, handsome, with a cigar. Approach him and find out who he is. Make friends with him. This isn't part of the training. Barak and Pinhas don't know. For your report on me, say anything, I'll back you up. I've finished the exercise. I'm worn out. May I get a quick drink? It's in the lobby. OK. Thanks. Should one of your pupils be having a chin-wag with the US cultural attaché? - What? - You'd better come along. Ariel Brenner. I'll take an option on him for Unit 238. I'll file a complaint against you. I'm getting sick of your lousy methods. Assigned to Unit 238 Not listed A relative? An uncle. He's dead. You think he worked for us? Might have done. The computer doesn't know everything. You're Ariel Brenner? Yes. Your mother died, right? Yes, two years ago. My name's Yossi. You headed the Munich team? So they say. And set up Operation Moses? Perhaps. I'm credited with lots of things. They assigned you to Unit 238, right? The famous nuclear unit! Be careful! What about? Are you hungry? You'll work with the worst pack of brutes this country ever produced. Their only motto is: "Peace is avoidable". Jewish morality isn't their cup of tea. Why? Should Jews be better than anyone else? They've retained nothing from the trials the Jews went through. Maybe they want to avoid others. God wanted to put man to the test, to test his soul. He told the Jews: I'll judge you. You'll suffer greatly and we'll see if you remain human. In fact, through the Jews, he's judging himself. To see if his creation was a mistake. There is a lot at stake for him. God is scared. Scared he got it wrong. Scared of seeing his failure in our bankruptcy. I don't believe in God. I believe in chance, that's all. I fight only to defend myself and what I consider my land. There is no God. Land is just sand. Nothing else. Don't I speak good French? I've a weakness for complicated words. Unconstitutionally. After my training, I was made a senior intelligence officer. I'd have loved to have told you about it. But obviously it was forbidden. In Israel we're invisible but admired. We're called "Princes". I was eager to earn that title. Soon after graduation, I got my first big assignment. It was in Paris. Guess I was chosen for my French origins. The man was a nuclear engineer working on a French nuclear plant for an anti-Israel country. It was developing weapons of mass destruction against us. We had to get the plant's plans from this man. If it was military, our government intended to destroy it. In a friendly country, we have to be careful. The man mustn't find out who we were. That's called a manipulation, it's what our job is. Keep going! Play on! You're on your own! Play on! You OK? Sorry, I played the ball. - Nothing broken, I hope. - I don't think so. Sorry about that... How is the ankle? Got a jump lead? A jump lead? No. Why, your car broke down? Battery's dead. I don't get it. Put this under it. No, he's out, playing soccer. Someone's at the door. See you on Tuesday? No husbands, of course. Anyway, mine goes to bed early. Take care. Hello. Sorry to bother you, I'm your upstairs neighbour My boyfriend forgot to leave me the key. May I use your phone? - Sure, come in. - Thanks. This way. Hi, is Jean-Jacques there, please? Marie calling. It's me. I had to talk to you. No. No, I won't hang up. Please talk to me... You must tell me why... You don't realize what you're doing... How can you talk to me that way? What have I done? I don't understand. Is it because of the abortion? You told me to do it. So that's it! I don't understand, we have to talk about it. I wanted to keep it, you didn't. Now, you blame me. We'll start over again. Don't talk to me that way! This can't be you! Don't talk that way! I beg you! Please. Tell me this isn't you. Don't hang up! OK, I'll stop... - Françoise! - Yes? - What are you doing? - I'm going out. Nice soccer game? Yeah. Had a good workout? He didn't mention me, or the car. We were right about that marriage. I was in charge of this operation. But my team had more field experience than me. It's common practice among us, since we all have the same rank. We switch according to the mission. Bill Haydon, the Leopard contact, had led a mission in Brussels. Yuri, a.k.a. Fatso, had set up a network in Cairo. Now, they were my assistants. Ben was my security. One day I'll just be a contact agent, or a legman. If this operation failed, I'd be out. If one of us got arrested, I'd be to blame. What now? Next Saturday, I'll bring some chicks. What kind? The opposite of his wife: young, sexy... No, if they look like sluts, they'll scare him. - Don't we screw 'em? - It's not their job, it's too soon. We had a nice game, today. Meet my friends, Liza and Philippine. - Hello. - Anybody expecting you? Yes, my wife. Mine lives in London. I work in Paris. Complicated life! You're a businessman too? No, I'm a teacher. - Of what? - Math. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Marie-Claude. Bernard Bach? I had a hard time finding your room. Did you move? Yes, but I warned Mrs Thomas. - Mrs Thomas... - Come in. Sit down. Care for a drink? A Coke. I want you to spend an evening with a friend. Oh yeah? That's for coming tonight and an advance for next time. We'll phone you to tell you when and where. The person will ask for Mrs Gauthier. You answer "wrong number" and hang up. Then you'll have 15 minutes to dial this number from a booth. You'll ask: "Is George there?" Don't say "please". If you do, it means you're in trouble. No "please", no problem. "Please", if you have a problem. OK? It's OK with me. Don't use a phone near your house. Take the subway, one stop. By problem, I mean if you're followed or if someone's with you, even your mother. OK. No mother. Any questions? No. For that price I get very smart. You'll report to me. That's all. Learn that number by heart. Then do I swallow it? Please do. Why are you smiling? He's a nice guy. He'll help us destroy that plant, so I like him. If he asks you why, will you say that? It's easy to act what you believe. But why do you, Haydon, like him? Why? Because he seems sincere. No ulterior motives. He doesn't want to stab me in the back. Sure he doesn't suspect you? I don't bug him with questions. Someone who isn't curious is odd. I'm doing OK. What have you asked him? Did he answer? Did he dodge anything? What did he say about himself? Let's go over it again. I'll tell you what business is all about. It's simple: you find someone who needs something. You buy it from someone who can't sell it, and you clean up. Thanks for the other night... the restaurant you told me about... My wife loved it. My wife loves nothing, especially me. You kidding? I can't have children. You got kids? No. Sorry, I'm being nosy. - More coffee? - No. - Let's forget about a trip. - Yes. - Neither for business or... - Of course. - We don't touch her. - No. His wife's got no brothers or sisters? No. But if something happened to her mother, she'd go visit her. Probably. Something has to happen to her. What's wrong? Ever wonder why you're in charge of this mission? Yes. So? I don't know the head of the nuclear unit. Or why he gave me this mission. You don't know? You weren't chosen for your strength but for your weakness. You're an asshole. We need assholes like you in the service. We're all desperados, guys who've seen Egyptian jails. They can't bully us. You don't know the head of the service. But he knows you. He's enjoying himself. Because you're like putty. We have to break her legs. Both of them. She'll be laid up for a while, his wife'll go see her. At least for 2 weeks. That'll give us time. Dear Laurence, I wrote you at the time. I couldn't tell you I was in Paris. Our mail was sent to Tel Aviv and then to our families. I couldn't pop in to kiss your daughter, whom I never met. He's phoning. Go ahead. - Mr Haydon's office. - Is Mr Haydon there? - Your name is...? - Rémy Prieur. Hi, how are you? - Am I interrupting? - Not at all. You work on Saturdays? Sometimes. You're not in the country? No, my wife went alone. - So we're both single tonight. - Yes. - Want a drink? - Yes, sure. - Tonight? - OK. I'm still busy. I'll call you back, we'll meet at my hotel. OK. What's your number? 47 70 64 64. May I speak to Mrs Gauthier? Sorry, my mistake. Hello. May I speak to George? Hello. Everything OK? I didn't say "please". So I'm OK. Go to Hilton Hotel tonight, at 9 PM. Mr Haydon's room. Haydon... OK. From then on, just be natural. OK. I'm told you're very good at that. Care to try me? How are you? She'll be here soon. They're always on time. Fabulous bathroom! I pick hotels for their bathrooms... and beds. Try that one. Yes? Speaking. Why? The meeting was tomorrow. What did he say? What happened? - Hello. - Hello. Come in. What else can I do? Sit down. - Do I have to? - No. OK, I'll be right there. Sorry, something urgent came up. I'll try and hurry. - We can postpone this... - You crazy? Let me introduce you: Marie-Claude, Rémy. Rémy, Marie-Claude. Hello. I'm off. Stunning, eh? I'm dealing with businessmen? No, not me. Do I get a drink? Sorry, I'm an idiot. What'll you have? Same as you. No ice. Know how the Americans avoid sexual blackmail? When you're hired by the CIA, you agree in writing that within 60 days, you'll disclose your sexual aberrations to your family. After that, the CIA does it. Gays can be agents, but they have to inform their families. Sexual blackmail is passé. You know the story about the Pakistani Prince? He was in Moscow. The KGB showed him pictures of him naked with whores He looks at them and says: "Great! I'll have 10 of this one, 11 of that one..." You ever been sexually blackmailed? What sexual aberrations would you admit to? Nothing? So you're pure. A virgin? You are? My brother's a rabbi, he'd love that! There are so few around, especially in our field. Virgins are safe. It's hard to recruit a virgin girl. A guy told me once... He had to file a report on an ambassador's secretary. He used every gadget: her apartment was rigged like a TV studio! He figured that a cute secretary... She was a real nun! She didn't ball one guy... He threw men at her... You don't know someone's sex life, you're lost... If you do, you can write a novel. Tell me how you screw and I'll manipulate you... We were filmed? Yes. Did you watch it? Yes. All of it? No... What a pity. Worried about something? Maybe I can help you? Do I have to steal anything, or poison him? No. Know what I'll do with your client next time? I'll think about you. Tell me if it shows. What about Leopard? It's the code name of a French engineer. I know. But how is it going? I don't know. Why not ask them directly? Don't they report to you? I like to check things out myself. You're the head of Mossad. If you don't know your rival's moves, you won't be head of Mossad long. I just control them. You can't control those people. Did you enjoy it? 3 months later, I got a message from Tel Aviv the usual way. They had studied my reports, the phone taps, the video tapes. They green-lighted me for the recruiting phase. What's this thing? It's a medical device, a radiation meter. - Got the water? - Yeah. Why do you have it? It's a sample. My partner's buying a whole stock of them. - Got a cigarette? - Yeah. It won't work. What? It's none of my business, but that meter won't work. How do you know? I know. How come you know those things? I'll show you. Old watches contain radium, a radioactive element. The device should react to it. Doesn't react. Maybe this one's badly calibrated. But you'll have to check them all. That's a drag! I'll warn my partner. He needs an expert. What a mess! Maybe I can help. Thanks, but we don't need a math teacher. I'm not a math teacher. - No? - No. Thank you. Recruiting's always tricky. You can set up a target for months, know his failings, motives, fears. You're never sure he'll go along. All operations rely on luck. At some point, you step into the unknown. Intelligence is like poker: in time, you have to go for broke. This data is needed to decide on the raid. Leopard has no access to it. He has to get it. It's essential. What about documents he can't copy there? He'll take them out. He was told he wouldn't have to. He can't refuse us anything now. See you tomorrow, Prieur. Got a light, please? Thanks. Sorry, got the time? 4.55 PM. Good thing he was told not to turn around! It's too soon. I'm afraid it's too late. - He hasn't delivered it all. - We've no choice. We can't rush him. I know. But the information's urgent. The operation can't take place without it. I can try to reassure him. Something's going on. Rémy, you OK? You sick, Rémy? Rémy, open up! You're white as a sheet! I'm in... an impossible position. What kind of position? - What have I done? - Well, what have you done? I met a guy playing soccer.... His name is Bill Haydon. He's rich... nice... He works in Paris and London. - A businessman. - What's all this mean? I was careful, I never told him what I do. They train us for what I do. We have awareness meetings. I didn't tell him what I do. He's spilling the beans! I told him what I do. - He had a problem with a meter. - What meter? He had a problem with a meter. He was buying a lot of them. He was a bit lost... So I helped him. I helped him. Then I met the other guy... Hello. Hi Rémy, Bill Haydon speaking. Am I disturbing you? No. You're back from London. This morning. How are you, buddy? Alright... If you spill it all to your wife, mention Marie-Claude. Be a pity not to. If you've forgotten anything, I can help you. I've got videotapes and recordings. Like, the date you fucked her in the ass was November 12. So call me if you blank out. Bye. Rémy? Where are you going? Where are you going? Again? Who was it? That type of incident can be seen as a mistake. I had overestimated Rémy Prieur's strength. He had a nervous breakdown, left for the country with his wife. I didn't try to stop him. I messaged Tel Aviv. They said the head of Unit 238 was coming to replace me. How are you, Brenner? This is Ahmad Sa'adi. PhD in nuclear physics. He'll be at the Hotel Lafayette tomorrow. Room 527. He runs the whole program. He alone can answer our questions. We're going to recruit him, but there's no time to pussyfoot. We'll be fast and straightforward. "Yes or you're dead," and screw the rules. Stop the strumming while I talk! He's married with 3 kids, under surveillance 24 hours a day. But when he's abroad he likes hookers. So get me one for him. A classy one. "Apparently, the murder was a professional job. "No one heard anything, nothing was stolen. "The police haven't ruled out an espionage action "or an underworld slaying. "They're seeking the victim's last contact, "a call-girl known in luxury hotels." Call the whore. Hello. May I speak to Mrs Gauthier? Sorry... Where do you re-contact her? If there's a problem, at St Germain cinema 1 hour after her call. Good. Is George there, please? He's busy. Call later. There's a problem. You bet! The police are after her. I'll go with Yuri and Ben. You and Fatso stay here. - Why? - Because. What are you doing? Going out. What happened? A girl got hit by a car. Awful mess. Dear Laurence, now you know why I kept quiet about what I did. It's so far from your life. I'm more than ever a stranger to you. Yet I'm not so far away from you. I know a lot. Your habits, working hours, hangouts. In intelligence, we're very considerate. Any detail interests us. Your homes hold no secrets, your neighbours are our friends. Your au-pairs our confidantes. Come. Sure she won't be back? She works in the suburbs today. I pick up her kid from school. And her husband? He moved out two years ago. She changed the lock. Anyone else? Yes. You're nosy! What are you doing? Just looking... She has a relative in the navy? Her brother. He lives in Israel. Really? - What does he do? - Nobody knows. She rarely sees him. I think he went nuts... in Israel. Got a light? - A.B. André...? - Berman. Shit! Hi, Helena. I left my address book... Maybe in the bedroom. - You went to the cleaner's? - Not yet. I'll take your jacket when I go out. Has Zylberman arrived? Already?... With whom? Look in his office... I'm afraid your kid brother's spying on you. You can't know why I'm telling you all this. There's also the Aladdin case. My second big mission started here, near the Tel Aviv market. After the Leopard case, I handled routine for Unit 238. I attended briefing sessions with U.S. intelligence. Can't you take away your crap? This isn't an office! He tried to join the CIA in '68. He failed a lie-detector test. And he smoked marijuana. The NSA took him anyway? The CIA didn't forward his file. He's a compulsive liar. At college he pretended his father was with the Mossad and that he was an agent, too. The Mossad doesn't want him. Do they know him? He's listed as "dubious". His handwriting test was a disaster. He's married to a goy. No kids. So what? He contacted me in the weirdest way. What about his data? Aman's analysts are amazed. They want more. "Outstanding", they say. Then let's go. We'll name this source Aladdin. No one will know who he is. Nothing in the files, or the computers, no secretary knows, no reports. You're in charge. We were breaking two basic Israeli secret service rules: not spying on the US, so as not to harm a bilateral cooperation agreement. Never use a Jewish agent against his own country. But those were Mossad rules. Yossi headed a different outfit: Unit 238. He felt above all rules. Your name is Raphael Chavit. Those are the details on your cover. Been doing this long? Since the beginning. Everything goes through you. What do you want to know? Have you ever seen that girl? Give me a break... Did you do ID for her? Yossi questions me every day. About your mind. I'd rather not have to tell him. If we'd brought her out, would you know? I never made papers for her. Can anyone see a difference? Except for me, no. How? Look at the stamps in the light. When you look through, you can see some are stamped over others. One per page. Never the same one. That's my signature. Here, you can check if you're followed! Right. Give me your ticket. Here. You're leaving tonight. Here are your instructions. Don't go home. Learn that and swallow the paper. Now tell me about our friend. I want to know him as if I'd met him myself. How come you're using this source? By accident. Why isn't the Mossad in charge? Aladdin contacted one of our agents. A change of contact was too risky. Are you keeping details from us? I'll give the Prime Minister all the data if he wants it. I don't want to say any more today. Right now it would not be useful. I need to know if I can carry on. Of course you can. If we had to rely on US intelligence to get this kind of material... If Aladdin is American, he'll get caught. It will cause a diplomatic crisis, a gigantic one. That is, if Aladdin is American. That's highly unlikely. Hello. Room service... They're here. I learned a new word in your absence: "emoluments". I want to lick every inch of your body. Yes? Sorry, wrong room. I'm sorry. Yossi had met Pelman 3 months ago in Paris. I hadn't heard from him, but I knew the operation was on. Yossi dazzled everyone. Aladdin provided more top secret data than any other source. No one wanted to know where it came from. Here comes the wolf. Who's gonna get eaten? Hi, Ariel. I have to talk to you about Aladdin. Wait till we've left. There's a problem... It's no concern of mine. A serious problem... He wants to quit. He won't talk to Yuri anymore. So? You get along with him. He trusts you. Go talk to him. I don't believe it. I don't believe what I'm hearing. Now you want me to clean up the shit? Find someone else. You're good at cleaning shit up. You like doing it. This thing stinks. I want no part of it. Ariel, where are you going? - To pack your bags? - No. Arrest me, I don't care. I'm not going. You know I like you? Even though you're a pain in the ass. Why don't you get married? Get married, have kids. But not with a whore, OK? Not with a whore. Yuri? It's Rafi. - What is it? - Jeremy's blown. - Where are you? - In a bar, with Catherine Pelman. What's the emergency procedure? Yuri? What's the emergency plan? There is none. We have no emergency plan. Get out of the country fast. Could you tell us about Aladdin? No. You're answering a commission appointed by the Prime Minister. I'll gladly talk to the Prime Minister. Is Aladdin still productive? Your silence amounts to an admission. Aladdin is still productive. Is Pelman Aladdin? If Pelman wasn't American, I'd let them believe he was just to preserve Aladdin's true identity. Pelman will get life imprisonment. So what? Should I cry? My tears dried long ago. Where's agent Ariel? On a mission. I heard he vanished. So they say. If he talks, Israel will pay for it. I don't follow you. You'd better find him. Dear Laurence, I'm one of the few who can prove Pelman worked for Israel. Through this notebook, you know an embarrassing secret. But what could you do with it? Assume it's all lies. Forget names, dates and events. I didn't write you to disclose state secrets. I just wanted you to know what I did all these years. Am I dreaming? No. May I come in? Yes. - I dropped by. - That's OK. You've changed. Guess I'm older. Show me your hands. Still not a worker's hands. Do you have an accent? Speak! Hi, I'm Ariel, I live in Tel Aviv. I'm visiting my sister in her fancy apartment. It's not fancy! You seen fancy places? Yes. Have I changed? No. You say that to please me. No. You're still as ugly. Laurence? It's my brother. Hi, I'm Daniel. Ariel. Come on. Won't be a second. Who's that? Uncle Ariel. He lives in the desert. - Hi, Eva. - Hello. I'm uncle Ariel. Where's your camel? I told her you had a camel. I left it at home. It's too cold here. I want to see it. You will. In Israel. Time for sleep now. Tomorrow, she'll say she dreamed of you. This is for her. What are you doing in Paris? - I have lots to tell you. - Me too. I live alone with Eva now. - What about him? - We'll see. He's a bureaucrat. I've got something for you. A diary. It's about my activities these past years. Sounds very mysterious. You're in a hotel? Don't be silly. Sleep here. OK. One last question? - Sick of being grilled? - No. Not if I can enlighten you. Do Israeli ID cards really mention one's religion? Yes. Doesn't that shock you? Yes. It's unbelievable. Israel isn't at peace. It can't act like other countries. - Am I wrong? - No. It's constantly being attacked. But it still manages to remain a democracy. Right? Yes. - Any coffee left? - Who wants some? - Please. - Me too. So you work in a ministry? What exactly do you do? Same work as you. - You're not leaving your bag? - No. See you later. Hello, Ariel. How do you like my new word: "procrastination"? You only see the dark side of things. Arrival of flight EgyptAir 799 from Cairo. Hello. I have to ask you some questions. Just routine. Go ahead. Where was this passport issued? In Paris. - Had any accidents? - No. - Where are you going? - Tel Aviv. - But where? - Hotel Dan Panorama. Room 1024. Follow me, please. Subtitles: ECLAIR
