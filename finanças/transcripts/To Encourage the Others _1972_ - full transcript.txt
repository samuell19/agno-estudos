NARRATOR: These events took place on a Croydon rooftop on Sunday, the 2nd of November, 1952. This is the true story of what subsequently happened to sixteen-year-old Christopher Craig and nineteen-year-old Derek Bentley. -(DOOR BELL RINGING) -(URGENT KNOCKING) OFFICER: Open up, it's the police. -Is it my brother? Is it Derek? -(CLANGING) Your brother's killed a policeman. What do you mean? What do you mean he's killed a policeman? Where is he? -It's four o'clock in the mooing. What the hell do you think you're doing?! Your son's killed a policeman. -Oh, no! What are you talking about? My boy wouldn't kill anyone, let alone a policeman -Who are you? Never mind about that. -Who the hell are you? -That's my brother -Will, what's he talking about? -What the hell's going on here? I don't know, Bert. Some nonsense about Derek having killed a copper! -Who told you that? -He did! -Here, you're not taking that knife! -Why not? So you can say you found it on my son! We need it down the station to clear up a few points. Come on, let's go. (DOOR SLAMS) NARRATOR: The two men in charge of police investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Smith and Detective Sergeant Shepherd received a request for an immediate full report. The man who made the request was Prime Minister Winston Churchill On the 11th of November, 1952, Christopher Craig made his first appearance in public since he had jumped from the thirty-foot high roof. He was brought to Croydon Magistrates' Court and publicly charged with the murder of PC Miles. Medical evidence given at this hearing confirmed that he was suffering from a broken back, a broken wrist and broken ribs. The following week, both Craig and Bentley were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. Just two days before the trial was due to commence, Barrister John Pam's received the brief to defend Christopher Craig. He travelled to London to seek an adjournment. Waiting for this meeting was Frank Cassels, Bentley's defence counsel. Parris asked Cassels for an opinion on the case. I think both the little bastards ought to swing. Also present at this meeting were prosecuting counsel Christmas Humphreys and the man who was to sit in judgement at the trial, Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Goddard. I don't see that Craig has any defence, adequate or otherwise, and in view of the fact that the prosecution are ready to proceed and Frank is ready on behalf of Bentley, I think the sooner we get on with it, the better. PARRIS With respect, My Lord, I cannot accept that Craig has no defence. I'm not in the habit of defending clients that have no defence to run. LORD GODDARD: If he has defence, what is it? Manslaughter. Manslaughter? Nonsense. Sheer nonsense. They continued to argue for thirty-five minutes. John Parris expanded on what Craig's defence would be with Lord Goddard openly contemptuous of the defence counsel's arguments. The entire conversation taking place in front of Christmas Humphreys. This situation gave the prosecution counsel more than ample time to prepare a rebuttal to that defence. Eventually, Parris tried a different gambit. Look, er... If this case starts tomorrow, it will last longer than two days. You'll still be sitting on Monday. Wheat of it? Well, correct me if I am wrong, but aren't you due at the Appeal Court next Monday? Er, Mr Humphreys. Er, will you make an announcement in court? That after due discussion, er, the case is being adjourned until Tuesday, 9th of December. That suit you, Mr Parris? On the black market, seats for the trial were sold for £30 each. MRS BENTLEY: Here, Will, ain't that Mr Stevens? MR BENTLEY: Hello, Mr Stevens. Hello, Mr Bentley. Mrs Bentley. -Mr Stevens. Who's that man you were with? That's Frank Cassels. He's defending your son. He's calling on me to give evidence about Derek's coat, isn't he? Oh, quite likely. So I'm afraid you'll have to wait outside until you're called. It's worth waiting. Fairfax reckoned he knocked my hoy to the ground. If he fell on a wet tarmac roof, how come there aren't any marks on his coat? I've had it checked, you know. Here, who's that? Er, talking with the police? (INAUDIBLE) Oh, now, that's the prosecuting counsel. He's a fine man. He's a Buddhist, you know. He don't look foreign. (CHUCKLING) No, I mean his religion. He's a great believer in non-violence. Well, he can start with finding out who gave my boy a good hiding. I think he may well have other plans concerning your son. I really must go in now, the court's just about to sit. Excuse me. -IRIS: Good luck, Mr Stevens. -Oh, thank you. HUMPHREYS: May it please you, My Lord, gentlemen of the jury. In this case, I'm instructed for the Crown with my friend Mr John Bass. The accused, Christopher Craig, who is sixteen-and-a-half years of age, is represented by my friend, Mr Parris. The accused, Derek Bentley, further from you, who is nineteen-and-a half is represented by my friend, Mr Frank Cassels. Now, the charge against those two youths is that on the night of the 2nd of November last, they together murdered a police officer, Sidney George Miles. A charge to which they have pleaded not guilty. Now, you may have read something of this case in the press. You may have read how these two young men were found on the roof of a building in Croydon. That there was, what was described as a gun battle, as a result of which one police constable was killed and another wounded, and of a spectacular jump, or dive, by the boy, Craig, from the roof of the building as a result of which he was injured and had to appear at the Magistrates' Court on a stretcher, and of the alleged confessions of Bentley that he knew Craig had a gun. Now, on behalf of the prosecution, I ask you to forget everything you have read about this case up 10 the moment. This case will be tried, as cases are in every English Court, upon the evidence before you and on that alone. That's it. Right. Al light, love? Now, the case of the prosecution is this: That Craig deliberately and wilfully murdered that police constable, and thereafter, gloried in the murder. That Bentley incited Craig to begin shooting. And, although technically under arrest at the actual time of that killing of Miles, was party to that murder and equally responsible in law. Did your son ever manage to read or write, Mr Craig? No, Christopher suffered from what I believe is known as 'word blindness'. Word blindness? But you tried, did you not, night after night, -to teach him to read? -On, I did indeed, sir. HUMPHREYS: As a result of that, the only reading matter he is familiar with are, what are called comics? Yes, just small words. I think the only books that he knows anything about are the books of Enid Blyton, that he gets other people to read to him? Yes. I believe you encouraged the family to take an interest in shooting, as you yourself were a very good marksman. Well, I did teach my elder boys to shoot well at target practice with air guns and air pistols, but not with live rounds and revolvers. Do you remember, about a year ago, going to a rifle range with Christopher, when you both shot at a target? MR CRAIG: I do. I think all your bullets were within half an inch of the target and nearly all of his were outside? Yes, he did not make a good group. But he had not had a lot of practice with that type of rifle. HUMPHREYS: Did you know that it was Christopher's ambition in life -to be a gunsmith? -Yes, but we didn't take it seriously because we didn't think it was a calling he should follow. Was Christopher ever, to your knowledge, a violent boy? Never. In fact, quite the opposite. Gentle? Very gentle. I believe that until eighteen months-to-two years ago, he used to go to a Bible class at a church in Streatham. He did, but he stopped going in case they asked him to read a lesson. As he couldn't read, he would have been embarrassed. All his life he's been very conscious of the fact that he could not read. And was mocked by the other boys for that reason? Yes. Thank you, Mr Craig. Er, no questions. (INAUDIBLE) And did you know he'd sawn off the barrel of this revolver? I... Certainly did not. Well, did you know he had hidden the sawn-off piece in the attic of your house? I did not. Well, did you know he'd hidden in your house that large quantity of ammunition? Which is, er, exhibit number 14. Er. I did not. Including twenty-five air gun pellets, Twenty-two rounds of .22, twenty-eight rounds of .32, twelve rounds of .38, forty-six rounds of .31, three rounds of 45, eight rounds of .303, and five rounds of .303 blanks! Now, you knew nothing about that? I did not. No further questions. Sergeant Fairfax, did you, on the 2nd of November, go with Police Constable Harrison and other officers in a police car to the premises of Messrs Barlow and Parker at Tamworth Road, Croydon? Yes. And you were the first police officer, as far as you know, -to enter the building? -Yes. And you climbed up onto the flat roof by a drain pipe in the passage? Yes. What did you do when you got up onto the roof? I saw two men. -The accused? -Yes. What did you do? I walked towards 'em. And as I did, they backed away and went behind the lift head. And? I walked to within six feet of the lift head and shouted, "I'm a police officer. Come out from behind that stack." Craig, shouted back, "If you want us, fucking well come and get us." I said, "All right." I rushed behind the stack and got hold of Bentley. I puled him out info the open. {then pushed him round the side of the stack, which Craig had just previously gone out of. I pushed Bentley round with a view to closing in on Craig. HUMPHREYS: So, with one man in your grasp, you pursued the other? FAIRFAX: Yes. I pursued the other. HUMPHREYS: Er, what happened? FAIRFAX: As we got to the corner of the stack, Bentley broke away from me. And as he did so, he shouted, "Let him have if, Chris." There was a flash, and a loud report, and I felt something strike my right shoulder, which caused me to spin round and fall to the ground. Now just indicate to the jury, how the bullet went The bullet went through there. HUMPHREYS: At that point, -how far away were you from Craig? -About six feet. HUMPHREYS: And what happened next? As I was getting up from the ground, I saw one person moving away from me to my left and one person moving away to my right. And now, to get it clear, as a result of your being shot and knocked down, Bentley had got out of your grasp? -Yes. And? FAIRFAX: I made a grab at the fellow on my right, and found that ! had again got hold of Bentley. 1 struck him with my fist and he fell to the ground. As he fell, there was a second loud report. And I then pulled Bentley up in front of me as a shield. LORD GODDARD: The report was a report of gunfire? FAIRFAX: Yes, sir. I then pulled Bentley to the side of the roof light and searched him to see if he was carrying a gun. He was not carrying a gun. But in his pocket, I found a knuckle-duster. HUMPHREYS: Is, er... Is that the knuckle-duster? Yes. May the jury see that, My Lord? LORD GODDARD: They may. You will be able to have it later, members of the jury, but just look at it now. HUMPHREYS: Er, what else did you find on him? In his right-hand pocket, I found a knife. HUMPHREYS: Is that the knife? Yes. May the jury look at that, My Lord? -Yes. Er, did he make any comment? He said, "That's all I've got, Governor. I haven't got a gun." I then told him I intended to work him around the roof to the roof entrance. There was some protection there. HUMPHREYS: Mmm-hmm. What did Bentley say when you told him of your plans? Bentley said, "He'll shoot you." And did you work him round until he was sheltered with you by this staircase head? FAIRFAX: Yes. LORD GODDARD: Er, working him round the right-hand side of the roof? FAIRFAX: Yes, sir. Craig had followed us round to approximately the middle of the roof. He then retreated back to the top right-hand corner of the roof. HUMPHREYS: Now, Sergeant Fairfax, you say it was the third shot that was fired that was the fatal shot. Is that right? -The shot that hit PC Miles, sir? -Yes Oh, no, to my recollection, there were several other shots. But I don't know what he was firing at. Well, you see, you have not mentioned that hitherto, have you? No. -You said there was one shot that struck you first of all, then another shot, and then the third shot which hit PC Miles. It certainly was not the third shot. Well, what other shots were there? I should say there were six or seven other shots. Before the fatal shot? Before the fatal shot, yes. (SCOFFING) Now, do I understand you correctly? There are six or seven other shots in addition to the ones that you told My Lord and the jury about? Yes, that's so. And you have not said a word about these shots until a few moments ago. -Have you, Officer? No. Well, did you see where these shots came from? -No -Where were you when they were fired? I was then round about the doorway and the bottom left-hand roof light. I suggest to you, that the first time a shot was fired was when you had Bentley already in your custody and had brought him round to somewhere near the doorway. Bentley had already been arrested. But at the time of the first shot, he was not in my grasp. He had already broken away from me. I suggest you already had him round by the doorway before Craig fired at all. No sir, definitely not... And at the time the first shot was fired, Craig was standing to the west of the shaft. No. Well, of course, it was dark. It was very confusing, what was going on out there, was it not? FAIRFAX: It was dark. You could see two people. But you could not see them clearly enough to recognise them. And did you hear a shot fired when Bentley called out, as you alleged, "They are taking me down below, Chris"? FAIRFAX: No. Well, were you in a position when that was said to hear a shot if one had been fired? FAIRFAX: Yes. PARRIS: Hmm... Well, let us see if I'm right in my addition. Is this the story? Two shots to start with, six or seven after that, the fatal one and one later? Yes. That makes ten or eleven shots in all that you say you heard. Yes. Thank you, Sergeant Fairfax. Is that the suit you were wearing at the time? Yes. CASSELS: Sergeant Fairfax, would you just lift up the jacket and waistcoat so that the jury may see? It shows the hole. -It has a jagged tear, is it not? -Yes. Not the normal neat hole that the bullet frequently makes? I can't answer that. -CASSELS: You do not know. -No CASSELS: Now, are you saying, Sergeant Fairfax, that Bentley broke away before the shot was fired or after? Definitely before the shot. Then you were not holding him when the shot was fired? No. (CHUCKLING) You see... I do not want to take advantage of any slip, but you did agree with my learned friend, Mr Humphreys, that Bentley broke away after the shot was fired You said "yes" to the question he asked. If I did, I've made a mistake. Because Bentley actually broke away from me before the shot was fired. Yes, the witness is quite right. I've made a note of it "As we reached the bottom left-hand corner, "Bentley broke away and shouted, 'Let him have it, Chris.' "There was a shot and a flash and I felt something strike me." CASSELS: I quite agree, My Lord. But, subsequently, Mr Humphreys asked a question which was framed like this: "As a result of your being shot and knocked down, "did Bentley break away?" And the answer was yes. That is why I do not wish to take advantage of it, if it is a mistake. What I suggest is this: That up until the shot was fired, Bentley had not said a word. No. What, you say that is wrong? No, that is quite right. Bentley had not said a word, until he broke away from me. That was not my question. My question was, until the shot was fired, Bentley did not say a word. Yes, sir, he did. I am suggesting that he never said, "Let him have it, Chris", or any words to that effect! He did. Was it not Craig that shouted out, "I've got a .45 Colt"? No. Did you ever hear Craig say that at any time on the roof? No. If another officer says he did say it, then you did not hear it. I did not hear it. No. You see, I'm suggesting it was Craig on the roof who said he had a 45 Colt and not Bentley. No, sir. It was definitely Bentley. Whether Craig said it as well, I did not hear. LORD GODDARD: Er, was the word you heard, "He' or 'I'? I heard Bentley say it, My Lord. Yes, what did he say? "He has got a .45 Colt and plenty of ammunition.” If it had been Craig who had said I, it would have been, "I have got a .45 Colt". That is why I asked whether the word was 'he' or. "He! sir. CASSELS: Officer, when did you make notes, as I imagine you did, of what was said on the rooftop? I did not make any notes. No notes at all? No. I dictated a statement. CASSELS; When did you dictate the statement? It was after receiving medical attention at the hospital. Somewhere between one and two in the morning of the 3rd of November. Had a number of police officers been to see you in hospital before you dictated that statement? No. None at all? I saw Detective Chief Inspector Smith and Detective Sergeant Shepherd at the hospital when they came in. Thank you, Sergeant Fairfax. At about that time, did you hear somebody shout something? I did. I heard someone shout, "Let him have it, Chris." Were you then on the ground or were you still on the pipe? I was practically level with the roof, My Lord, but I could not get up the last six feet. You were still clinging to the pipe when you heard it? Yes. You heard someone shout, "Let him have it, Chris." I do not suppose you knew the voice at that time, did you? I did not. Have you heard the same voice since? I could not say for certain. -Did you then climb down the pipe? -Yes And did you hear something? Yes, I had reached the ground, and I heard two or three shots fired from the direction of the roof. Did Bentley say, "Let him have it, Chris"? I couldn't say whether it was Bentley or not. But you heard the word 'Chris' used? I did, My Lord. So far as you know, there were three people on the roof. Yes. Sergeant Fairfax and the two men. Yes. And you heard, "Let him have it, Chris." -Is that right? -That is right, My Lord. Very good. After you heard this remark, how long did it take you to climb down the pipe? Minutes. -What? Well, a minute, My Lord. Well, could you have counted sixty? I'm not sure that I could. There's people who always say 'minutes' when they mean 'seconds' I saw Sergeant Fairfax move towards the lift shaft, he came to the right and detained a man there. I spoke to him and asked him if he was all right. Now, Constable Harrison, whom had he detained? It was Bentley, sir. What happened then? Well, he began to move his prisoner, or the person in custody, towards the door that led on to the roof. As he did, sir, the prisoner pulled away from him, broke away, and I heard him call out, "Let him have it, Chris." Who was it who called that out? That was Bentley. What happened after that? Well, immediately afterwards, there were two shots fired from the direction of the ft shaft and I saw Detective Sergeant Fairfax spin around and fall onto the roof. Were the shots fired in rapid succession or what? Fairly rapid, sir. Now, Dr Jazwon, you examined Detective Sergeant Fairfax when he was brought to Croydon General Hospital? Yes. His injury is what I think you describe as a searing wound. -Yes. -That is, it had passed over the surface of the skin and had not penetrated it. Yes. Now, am I right in thinking that it shows signs of going upwards and over? -Yes. -It goes up and over the shoulder. Yes, I suppose you could put it like that. Well, that would indicate to you, Doctor, that the bullet had come from a low level? Yes, it would appear to be like that. It is a self-evident proposition, is it not? Yes, My Lord. Then I don't know why the doctor's been brought down from Manchester to say that. I thought the jury might like to appreciate it. (SIGHING) Now, Doctor, I want you to draw some inferences from this. That officer found a bullet somewhere round his back braces. Now, is what you found in your examination consistent with the bullet ricocheting off the floor, searing the shoulder and going down behind? LORD GODDARD: Oh... Are you competent to answer such a question? No, I think not, really. -You prefer not? - I prefer not The doctor's here to give medical evidence, not speculate on the flight of bullets. I was asking whether what he'd found, the wound, is consistent with that theory. That is a matter you can address the jury on. It is not a matter for the doctor. If Your Lordship will not allow the question, that is all. I regret you've been brought all the way down from Manchester. The procedure of binding over was introduced for the purpose of saving the time of people who've been conditionally bound over. The wound that you've given evidence about and passing across the skin could have been perfectly well read. I regret that you have been brought, you are now at liberty to go. Lewis Charles Nickolls, you are a Master of Science, a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry and director of the Metropolitan Police Laboratory, New Scotland Yard? Yes. Mr Nickolls, Exhibit 8 is, in all probability, the fatal bullet, is it not? Found under the staircase head. I could find no evidence of blood on it whatsoever Therefore, in all probability, it is not the fatal bullet. May I put it to you that Craig's revolver with its sawn-off barrel is inaccurate to the degree of six feet, at a range of thirty-nine feet? -Oh, yes. -Quite as much as that? I think it would be of that order, yes. Some of the ammunition used was, of course, -of lower calibre than .45, was it not? -Yes, it was. That, of course, would make a shot more inaccurate. It would make it completely inaccurate. “It would make it completely inaccurate." Yes. A bullet was fired by Craig and Police Constable Miles, coming out of that roof entrance, fell dead with a bullet between the eyes Now, we do not know exactly where Craig was standing but, erm, give him the maximum distance of forty feet away. Now, if he fired at such people as are coming out of that staircase head, and fired more than once with the correct ammunition, was there a reasonable chance of his hitting them, or one of them, or some of them? I think it would be an extremely dangerous thing to do. LORD GODDARD: Er, Mr Humphreys, this is a case in which an officer of justice was murdered, -or shot -Yes, My Lord. Well, very different considerations, as you know, apply when an officer of justice in the course of the execution of his duty is Killed. Er, yes, My Lord, but with great respect, I was following up with this witness what I imagined to be, I may be wrong, the beginning of a certain line of defence. Well, if that defence is wrong, I shall instruct the jury that it is no defence at all. If Your Lordship pleases. That is the case for the prosecution. PARRIS: Between the age of eleven and your present age, how many weapons have you had? -Forty or fifty, sir. -"Forty or fifty." From where did you get these? Swapped them with the boys at school, sir. LORD GODDARD: What? I swapped them and, er, bought them off boys at school, sir. Did you ever take any of these weapons to school with you? Yes, I used to take all of them. What? I used to take all of them, sir. What, forty or fifty, do you mean? Well, I hadn't got them all at the same time, sir. Did you, on one occasion, go with your father to a shooting range? Yes. And did you know that firearms could kill people? Yes, sir. Let us get on to something that matters. Now, I want you to tell us in your own words what happened after the Officer Fairfax came onto the roof? Well, he came from one of those drainpipes and he came round and grabbed Bentley. Now, where was Bentley when he was grabbed? Well I was on the west behind the lift shaft. And Bentley was over the east side, standing in the gutter way, sir. The gulley. PARRIS: Now, when he grabbed Bentley, which way did the officer go? CRAIG: He took him round behind the staircase head. The roof entrance. Then he left Bentley and came hack for me. PARRIS: Now, the officer has said that at some stage of the proceedings, Bentley said, "Let him have it, Chris." -Did you hear any words like that? -No, sir. When was the first shot fired? CRAIG: Sergeant Fairfax was between the door and the roof lights. [ Fired at the ground about six feet in front of me, maybe less. When I fired, he ducked down to the ground. PARRIS: Did you fire another shot? CRAIG: Oh, not then, just little while later, sir. He got up and rushed at Bentley or something and ! tried to frighten him off, and ! fired another one over the side of the roof. So you fired another one to frighten him off, did you? How many shots do you say you fired altogether? Nine, sir. So you reloaded the revolver? Yes, sir. Reloaded it Did you see the Officer Miles come up onto the roof? I didn't see him come up on the roof, sir. The door flew open and I thought someone was coming out and ! fired another one to try and frighten them away. PARRIS: Where did you fire that shot? CRAIG: Towards the number 30 house, sir. Over the roof. PARRIS: That is, over the parapet side towards number 307 CRAIG: Yes, sir And how did it come about that it hit PC Miles coming out of the door? It might have ricocheted off, sir. I don't know. "It might have ricocheted"? Or anything, sir. Do you know how it came to hit him? No, sir. Had you any intention, at any time, of killing that officer? No, sir. Have you ever expressed any regret or sorrow that you killed that officer? Yes, sir. When? When I am in prison, sir. Who to? Well, I don't know. To anyone, sir. From the moment that you dived off the roof, what was the next thing that you remember? I was in hospital and I woke up when someone hit me in the mouth and called me a 'murdering bastard' PARRIS: What was the next thing after that? They were pushing down a corridor on a trolley and they were running me into the walls and all over the bumps 50 that they could hurt me. -Do you know who was doing that? -No, sir. On this night, November 2nd, you shot Police Constable Miles. -Is that right? -Yes -And he died? -Yes. You know that? CRAIG: I found out on Wednesday the 5th. -You meant to shoot him, did you not? -No. You meant to shoot any police officer who tried to prevent your escaping from the felony you were committing? I didn't What did you take the knife for? I always carried it, sir. What did you carry it for? Well, it is only a sheath knife. What is that spike for? Oh, I just put it in it There was a hole No, what did you put it there for? I just put it there, sir. What is the knuckle-duster for? To put on your hand, sir. To put on your hand to hit anybody with? Yes, sir. And what is that dreadful spike for? That was in there. LORD GODDARD: Yes, I know. But you say you made it. I want to know what you put it in there for. I didn't, sir. It was there. That was just a block of steel and I rounded off things and filed it a bit So that if you've got this on your hand, you've got this as well Yes, sir. -A dreadful weapon. -(THUD) And you had the gun, and Bentley knew it? CRAIG: No. Well, you discussed what you were going to do with it, did you not? No, sir. Do you say Bentley didn't know you had a gun? No, sir. Do you say that you were out with Bentley that night to do this shop-breaking and you did not tell him you had a gun? No, sir. Well, you told him when you were on the roof that you had a gun Well, yes, sir, when I saw the police. So, before there was any shooting, you told him in terms that you had a gun? -Yes. -And that it was loaded? Yes, sir. Was there any discussion about it being used? No, sir. Did you tell him that you had a gun 508510 make him feel safer there with you, 50 that if the police came, you had a gun to keep the police off? No, sir. Then why did you tell him you had got it? I don't know, sir. You do not know? You shot Fairfax at six-feet range, did you not? No, sir. Well, how far away do you say it was? CRAIG: Thirty-seven feet, sir. HUMPHREYS: Sergeant Fairfax has told us that he came and grabbed Bentley and while you were all there together by the head of the lift shaft, you deliberately shot him. I didn't, sir. Having been incited to do so by Bentley saying, “Let him have it, Chris." Now, are you saying, you did not hear that? Bentley didn't say it. Well, three officers heard it in the darkness from different points of the compass. Are you saying he did not say it? I'm saying I didn't hear it And if they heard it then they got better hearing than mine Well, do you remember, on the next evening in hospital, saying, "Your coppers, huh. "The other one's dead with a hole in his head. "I'm all right. "All you bastards ought to be dead." I told you, sir, I didn't know he was dead until Wednesday the 5th, because I got a newspaper then. So, all these officers who have given evidence about what you said, are not speaking the truth. Is that your story? Yes, sir. Now, tell the Jury again the answer to a question His Lordship asked you. From the moment you killed PC Miles, until you gave evidence in the witness box, have you ever shown the slightest word or sign of remorse or regret for killing him? -Not to anyone, sir... -Not to anyone? Well, I might have done, sir... Or was it only regret that you had not shot more of them? No, sir. I don't hurt people, sir. I think you were going to finish that remark, Christopher, "Not to anyone," but? I don't... Don't know what I was asked, sir. You were asked whether you had ever shown a sign of remorse or expressed a word of regret to anybody at having killed that young policeman? Well, it's all I think about in prison, sir. You may think about it, you were asked if you'd ever expressed any regret to anybody? Who is there to express it to, sir? -Have you said anything to your parents? -Yes, sir. You saw plenty of policemen because they were watching at your bedside. I wasn't conscious! I was hardly conscious half the time, sir. "Hardly conscious'! Don't talk such nonsense. PARRIS: What state you were in when you were in hospital? I was only half-conscious. I was crying for my mother. When you went out with all these weapons on you had you any intention of using any of them? No, sir. I've never hurt anyone in my life, sir. PARRIS Thank you, Christopher. Take the book in the right hand and read the oath. BENTLEY: (SOFTLY) I cant. I beg your pardon? I can't read. Say after me. I swear by almighty God, I swear by almighty God, -that the evidence I shall give -that the evidence I shall give -shall be the truth, -shall be the truth, -the whole truth, -the whole truth, -and nothing but the truth. -and nothing but the truth. CASSELS: Are you nineteen-and-a-half years of age? Yes. Up until the time of your arrest, were you were living at 1 Fairview Road, Norbury? Yes. What were you doing for a living? I'd been a dustman and on removals. Were you in work at this time? No. I'd had an accident. What happened when you got behind the stack? Sergeant Fairfax come and took me, sir. I couldn't see nothing where I was standing. He come and took me, sir, and he walked me across the roof. When Sergeant Fairfax came and took you, did he say anything? He said, "I'm a police officer. I've got the place surrounded." When Sergeant Fairfax took hold of you, did you make any effort to struggle? -No, sir. -Or any attempt to strike him? No, sir. At the time when Sergeant Fairfax got hold of you, did you know that Craig was armed? No. Had you said anything before any shot was fired? No, sir. Did you say, "Let him have it, Chris"? No, sir! Up until a time a shot was fired, did you know that Craig had a gun? No. What did you do when the shot was fired? I stood by Sergeant Fairfax, sir. Did you make any attempt to strike him while he was on the ground or while he was falling? No, sir! Was any mention made by anyone of a gun? I think Craig called it out, sir. I never said nothing 'cause I don't know one from another. From that time, until you were taken downstairs by the police, did you remain behind the staircase head? I did, sir. Were you being held all the time by police officers? No. Was there anyone to prevent you, if you had wanted, joining Craig? No, sir. Did you, when you were taken downstairs, say, "They're taking me down, Chris"? I think I said something of the sort, sir, but I can't remember what it was. -Something to that effect? -Yes, sir. Why did you say that? Well, sir, I thought his mind was disturbed and he might have shot anybody, sir. And later you say, "I knew he had a gun that was in the car, "put I didn't think he'd use it. "He's done one of your blokes in." Is that true or untrue? Untrue, sir. So, that is three police officers whose evidence is untrue against your evidence, which you say is true. -Yes. -LORD GODDARD: No, four. Er, Fairfax and McDonald on the roof, Roberts and Stevens in the car. If Your Lordship pleases. Anyway, on this night when you went to the warehouse, you knew perfectly well you were going to break in? Not until we got over the fence, sir. HUMPHREYS: Then Detective Sergeant Fairfax grabbed you? -Yes, sir -And you knew you were grabbed by a police officer when you were trying to commit a crime, did you not? 'Arrested.' Now you know what that means? -Yes. -And while you were arrested, you do your best to break away, and he, with you in custody, pursues Craig around the stack. -Is that right? -No, sir! At any rate, you broke away from him, -did you not? -No! And when he is no longer holding you, you call out, "Let him have it, Chris." -No, sir! -So that all three officers who heard you say that are wrong, are they? That's right. And in fact, Chris did let him have it -He did shoot, sir. -Yes. Now... (CLEARS THROAT) According to you, when you were over by the staircase head, you were not being held by a police officer. Is that right? That's right. So that, er, you were not under arrest at the time. I was standing there, sir. And you were not being held? -No, sir -You were quite free -to run away if you wanted to. -Yes, sir. And you were still on the roof when the shooting was going on. Yes, sir. In fact, you incited him to do something further. You shouted out, "Look out, Chris, they're taking me down." That was in case he shot me, sir. You were only thinking of your own skin, you mean? If he shot me, sir, there were two other police officers with me. You were frightened he might shoot at the police and hit you by mistake? He might have hit anybody, sir. The police did not matter? In fact, Sergeant Fairfax, having been hit, takes you behind the staircase head for cover and then you volunteer the remark when McDonald comes up. I think I've already put it to you, you say you did not say it, "I told the silly bugger not to use it." But did you also say to the officers later, "Look out, he'll blow your heads off? I can't remember saying that, sir. But you knew he was a thoroughly dangerous and irresponsible person with a gun in his hand, did you not? At the time he was shooting, yes, sir. And well before you got on the roof? -No, sir! -And when you thought you were being taken down, you incited him to shoot further 50 that you might get away from the police? If I'd done as you said, sir, I might have been shot myself. I see you're still thinking of your own skin. In other words, you were prepared to assist Craig by such hitting with knuckle-dusters or stabbing with daggers or shooting with a revolver at the police as would enable you to escape if caught in the crime you were committing? No, sir! CASSELS: My Lord, that is the case for Bentley. NARRATOR: After the lunch recess, Christmas Humphreys rose and began his final speech to the jury. He dealt, firstly, with the case against Craig, then turned his attentions to Derek Bentley. And you will also bear in mind that, to some extent, it is difficult to say now to what extent Bentley was under arrest. Now, I open to you in Bentley's favour that during the actual murder of PC Miles, he was physically under arrest. Bentley will not have it. Bentley is saying that he was not. That he was not being held, that he was free to get away. Therefore, any assistance that there was to Bentley that he was actually physically controlled at the time that Craig shot PC Miles no longer applies because he has knocked it from under his feet. Now, the all-important matter for you to consider is the evidence that Bentley knew that Craig had upon him a loaded gun. Now, did he or did he not say right at the beginning, "Let him have it, Chris?" Three separate officers, McDonald at the bottom of the drain pipe, Fairfax at the receiving end of the bullet, Harrison away to the right, as you look at the plan of the roof, heard that statement. Therefore, it was shouted. Now, Bentley asks you to say they did not hear it, that it was not said. If it was said, what does it mean but that Bentley knew that Craig had a gun and was urging him to use it? Why? Because he had been arrested. "Let him have it, Chris." And what was the answer to show that Craig understood that incitement but a bullet that hit Sergeant Fairfax. Now, Bentley himself was deliberately armed, was carrying a murderous dagger and he was given a knuckle-duster on the way to the premises. Now, Craig says he made it himself and just, erm, happened to have left the murderous spike on the end of it. And if Bentley is going to accept a murderous knuckle-duster, and he's already carrying of his own volition a murderous dagger, are you going to believe he did not know that Craig had a gun? At no time, or for one moment, throughout the whole of that twenty or twenty-five minutes did Bentley make a sound, either by shouting to Craig or even to the police officers, to show that his mind had ceased to be with Craig and that he was trying to stop Craig shooting and to throw away the gun. So, you have these two young men charged jointly with the murder of this police constable. It is the only issue you are trying. They are both sane in law as no attempt whatsoever has been made to suggest to you that they are not. They are both, therefore, young though they may be, responsible, like any other citizen in law, for what they do. Now, you have sworn to return a verdict according to the evidence. What may or may not be the result of your verdict is no concern of yours or any other person in this court. And I must ask you, in accordance with the oath that you have taken, to return a verdict on this indictment of guilty of wilful murder against each of these two young men. Well, if we have to wait out here much longer, Dad, I'm going in. Now then, love, don't you upset your father. He's got enough on his mind. You wait till I get him home. He's going to get a good hiding, giving us all this worry. No business getting up on that roof. PARRIS: Every one of us feels sympathy towards the men and women who loved the man who died. But this is a matter to be put out of your minds in this case. You are no more to decide Craig's guilt on the basis of sympathy for his parents, for his mother, surely the most tragic mother in England You are to decide this case on the evidence and on the evidence alone. I invite you to have a look at this jacket, I think it is Exhibit Number 17, and I hope you will have an opportunity of considering it The officer's story is that he was shot point blank from six feet. By my summation, this is a clear indication, the ragged nature of the tear, that what Craig says is right. That he fired down on the ground and that the bullet ricocheted up. It caused a jagged tear almost with a flap on it. Now, what Craig says is consistent with the nature of the exhibit. It is also consistent with what the doctor said about the nature of the wound. That it came from below and was passing over the shoulder. And you will remember that the bullet was found round the back braces. Now, is that not consistent and consistent only with Christopher Craig's story? He says, "The officer was thirty-seven feet, thereabouts, from me. "I fired down on the ground in front of me and the officer was hit." It was because the bullet bounced up, struck him on the shoulder, ran over his shoulder to the back of his jacket and dropped down behind his braces. Now, whether you think that is reasonable or not, I do not know. But I do say this: That both the injury that the officer received and the state of his clothing are not consistent with a bullet fired from six feet with a .455 Eley Now, whether it be a slightly undersized bullet or a completely undersized bullet, if it was fired at point blank range I suggest that it would have either drilled him, or at least have inflicted a very serious wound on him. How did the Officer Miles come to receive a bullet right through the forehead? You have heard what has been said about this revolver and the ammunition. And you may conclude that it was a tragic, unfortunate, million-to-one shot, because Mr Nickolls told you that at that range of thirty-nine feet the weapon would be inaccurate by at least six feet. LORD GODDARD: Er, Mr Parris, I think it only right that I should tell the jury that what you are saying to them now, no doubt with the best intentions, is not the law. If all your hypothesis were right, the defence of accident is not open to him for the reason that I shall explain to the jury, and it will be murder My Lord, the defence base it on the case of Appleby. You misread it. "If in the course of a struggle he accidentally caused an injury..." A man does not accidentally cause an injury if he shoots. The act has to be accidental. As I understand it, it was the injury which has to be accidental (SIGHS) Members of the Jury, it is said on behalf of the defence, that this was an accident. A tragic accident and not a deliberate act of murder. May I conclude with one final thing. If this boy had had the intention to murder police officers, as is suggested, why did he not kill Sergeant Fairfax when Sergeant Fairfax was within three-to-six feet of him on two occasions? I ask you, if possible, members of the jury to return in this case a verdict of manslaughter, which in the submission of the defence, would be consistent with both justice and law. MRS BENTLEY: What's happening, love? IRIS: Craig's barrister's just finished speaking Do you mean he's had to wait all this time? Oh, no, Mum, his final speech. -What about our barrister? -IRIS: He's just starting. Thank God for that. He'll be calling me soon. In a serious charge, such as this, the most serious charge that could be brought against any person, you will say to yourselves, "We must be quite certain that we have clearly formed in our minds "a picture of what took place on that roof "on the evening of Sunday, the 2nd of November." You will remember that it is common ground in this case that never, at any time at all on that roof, did Bentley offer violence to any police officer. Now, you might have thought that if he was on that roof, knowing Craig was armed and having incited Craig to use violence in resisting arrest, his behaviour might have been a lot different from what the police agree was his behaviour at that time. There is not a single piece of evidence from any police officer that at any time did Bentley attempt violence towards them. You've got to remember that if this man Bentley was inciting Craig to use violence in resisting arrest, his behaviour was unusual. Now, with regard to the alleged remark, "Let him have it, Chris.” It is as my learned friend has told you, the all-important remark in this case Because, I venture to suggest to you, if you are not satisfied that it was Bentley who made the remark, it will go a long, long way in helping you to come to a decision so far as Bentley is concerned. Now, three police officers say they heard the remark made. As against that, you have the evidence of Craig who says, "I never heard it" And he was standing almost as close to Bentley as to Sergeant Fairfax. And you have heard the evidence of Bentley who said, "I never said it." And you have this in addition, and I do suggest this is important: Was Bentley's behaviour, from that point onwards, the behaviour you might have expected of a man, one of two, who had broken into premises, or had attempted to break into premises, who knew his colleague was armed, who himself had invited his colleague to let the police officers have it, and whose colleague had, in fact, let the police officers have it? LORD GODDARD Er, gentlemen of the jury, I never like in so serious a case as this to start a summing up in the evening and then have to resume it in the morning So we will adjourn until tomorrow at 10:30. BAILIFF: The court will rise. NARRATOR: At lunchtime, Lord Goddard had said privately that he would sit that day until the verdict had been returned and the case concluded. Now, at 3:40, he had decided to adjourn until the following day. This decision ensured that there was a nineteen-hour gap between the speeches for the defendants and his own summing up to the jury. Now, members of the jury, in many respects, this is a terrible case. And one, therefore, that it is desirable you and I approach in as calm a frame of mind as we can. It is surely idle to pretend these days that a boy of sixteen does not know the wickedness of taking out a revolver of that description and a pocket full of ammunition and firing it when he is on an unlawful expedition and the police are approaching. It may be, and indeed I think it is probable, that you will find no room for manslaughter in this case. If I were to whip out a revolver and point it at you and shoot one of you gentlemen, and it killed you, it would be no answer for me to say, "Oh! I didn't mean to kill him. " Only meant to wound him." Have you ever seen a more horrible weapon? This is to hit a person in the face who comes 10 you. You grasp it here, your fingers go through. I cannot quite get mine through, I think And you've got the dreadful, heavy steel bar to strike anybody with. And you can kill a person with this, of course. And have you ever seen a more shacking thing than that? You have a spike with which you can jab anybody who comes at you. If the blow with the steel is not enough, you have a spike at the side to jab. You may wonder why Craig said, "I am only sixteen." Possibly, you may know that the law does not allow a capital sentence to be passed on a boy of sixteen. Was it a boast? "Ha-ha! Come on, I've got a gun. "I can't be hanged." You will think of that. Now, of course, the most serious piece of evidence against Bentley is that he called out, if you believe the evidence, to Craig, "Let him have it, Chris." And immediately the firing started and the very first shot hit Sergeant Fairfax. Those words are sworn to by three police officers. Sergeant Fairfax, PC McDonald and PC Harrison. They all swear that they heard Bentley call them out and then the firing began. Now, there's one thing I'm sure I can say with the assent of all you twelve gentlemen. That the police officers that night, and these three officers in particular, showed the highest gallantry and resolution They were conspicuously brave. Are you going to say that they are conspicuous liars? Because, if their evidence is untrue that Bentley called out, "Let him have it, Chris", those three officers are doing their best to swear away the life of that boy. If it is true, it is, of course, the most deadly piece of evidence against him. Do you believe that those three officers who've come into the box and sworn what is deliberately untrue, those three officers who, on that night, showed a devotion to duty for which they are entitled to the thanks of the community? Bentley's defence is, " didn't know he had a gun, "I deny that I said, 'Let him have it, Chris', "I didn't know he was going to shoot, and I didn't think he would " Against that denial, which is, of course, the denial of a man in grievous peril, you will consider the evidence of those three police officers who have sworn positively that those words were said. NARRATOR: After his summing up, Lord Goddard invited the jury to take any of the weapons into the jury room with them. They declined. But as they were filing out... My Lord, I would like to see Sergeant Fairfax's coat and waistcoat. You will remember, of course, gentlemen, that you are not considering the wounding of Sergeant Fairfax, you are considering the murder of PC Miles. (GAVEL THUDDING) At 11:15 on Thursday, the 11th of December, the Craig-Bentley jury retired to consider their verdict. If a jury's function is to arrive at a true verdict based on all the available evidence, then this particular jury was labouring under a number of serious handicaps. Two of the police officers who answered the initial 999 call to Croydon Police Station were Police Constables Pain and Bugden. Although present at crucial stages of the gun battle, they never deposed evidence at the committal proceedings at Croydon, nor did they give evidence at the Old Bailey trial. If believed, the most deadly piece of evidence against Bentley was that he had called out to Craig, "Let him have it, Chris." Detective Sergeant Fairfax was the first officer to swear that Bentley made the remark, and that the result was a shot from Craig fired at point blank range, hitting Fairfax in the shoulder. A 45 bullet fired from such close proximity, will, according to ballistics experts, either drill or shatter the shoulder. In fact, the bullet that hit Fairfax did not even draw blood, but travelled over the surface of the shoulder and came to rest in the officer's braces. The doctor is here to give medical evidence, not speculate on the flight of bullets. I was asking whether what he'd found, the wound, is consistent with that theory. That is a matter you can address the jury on. It is not a matter for the doctor. If Your Lordship will not allow the question, that is all. NARRATOR: if the Lord Chief Justice had not interrupted and then summarily dismissed Dr Jazwon, the jury would have learned that there were no powder burns upon Fairfax's coat and waistcoat. If the wound had been sustained at the close distance alleged, there would have been powder burns. This particular interruption was just one of two hundred and fifty interruptions that the Lord Chief Justice made during the two-and-a-half-day trial. I made a grab at the fellow on my right, and found that I had again got hold of Bentley I struck him with my fist and he fell to the ground. NARRATOR: Mr Bentley had expected to give evidence that his son's coat had been subjected to a scientific examination, and that there were no roof particles upon it He waited outside the courtroom for two days but was not called. You were still clinging to the pipe when you heard it? Yes. You heard someone shout, "Let him have it, Chris." I do not suppose you knew the voice at that time, did you? I did not. -Did you then climb down the pipe? -Yes And did you hear something? Yes, I had reached the ground, and I heard two or three shots fired from the direction of the roof. NARRATOR: McDonald's testimony directly contradicted the evidence of his colleagues Fairfax and Harrison. They both insisted that the immediate answer to the remark was a shot. Like the missing powder bums on Fairfax's coat, it was a powerful confirmation of Craig's account that he fired at Fairfax from a distance of thirty-seven feet and not six feet as alleged by the police. If McDonald had heard the remark when only a few feet from the top of the pipe, why did he then climb down? Why did he not wait for the outcome? The third officer who alleged he had heard the words, "Let him have it, Chris", was PC Harrison. He stated that he was standing by the chimney stack when the remark was made. This was Harrison's view of the roof during the moments leading to the firing of the first shot On oath, Fairfax had stated that, having grabbed Bentley, he made his way round the lift head, and rounding the western corner had been confronted by Craig. That Bentley had then broken free shouting, "Let him have it, Chris.” If Fairfax was correct in his recollection, then Harrison could not have seen Bentley break away. Alternatively, if Harrison is correct in his version that, having grabbed Bentley, Fairfax made his way towards the roof entrance, then Fairfax's evidence must be incorrect. The three police officers who accompanied Derek Bentley to Croydon police station were Stevens, who drove the car, Roberts and Alderson, who sat in the back of the car with Bentley between them. Roberts and Stevens stated whilst under oath that during the journey Bentley had said, " knew he had a gun, but ! didn't think he'd use it "He's done one of your blokes in." This was vital evidence against Bentley. For, if believed, I proved that Bentley knew prior to the attempted break-in that Craig was armed with a gun. Bentley denied making the incriminating remark. That leaves the evidence of Police Constable Alderson, squashed in the back of the car with Bentley next to him. Alderson never deposed evidence, did not appear at the Croydon committal proceedings and did not appear at the Old Bailey trial. Although Frank Cassels made particular reference in his final speech to Alderson's absence from the witness box, Lord Goddard, when summing up, not only ignored defence counsel's remarks, he actually advised the jury that all three officers had gone into the box and sworn that Bentley had made the remark in the car. On the evidence of the two police officers in charge of investigations, Craig had been questioned within one hour of his admittance to Croydon General Hospital. Whilst under oath, Detective Sergeant Shepherd alleged that Craig had said at that time, "I had six in the gun, I fired at a policeman, " had six Tommy Gun bullets.” Shepherd had then cautioned Craig, and, according to the police officer, the youth had replied, "Is the copper dead? How about the others? "We ought to have shot them all." Detective Chief Inspector Smith also recalled in the witness box a conversation he had had with Craig on the evening of Sunday, the 2nd of November, 1952. After Craig had been charged with the murder of PC Miles, it was alleged by Smith that Craig replied, "He's dead, is he? What about the others?" All these remarks attributed to Craig were vital, for, if believed by the jury, they satisfied all the basic points of law that had to be established beyond all reasonable doubt before Craig could be found guilty of murder, that he knew he was firing at policemen and that he was firing deliberately. Craig denied making these incriminating remarks. In the cubicle next to Craig was Detective Sergeant Fairfax, also receiving medical treatment. During a recent interview, he stated categorically that from the moment that Craig had been placed in the ambulance at Tamworth Road until well into the following day, Craig remained in an unconscious condition. The doctor who treated both Fairfax and Craig was Nicholas Jazwon. He has confirmed Fairfax's recollections that Craig was unconscious upon his arrival at the hospital and remained in that condition throughout the night Neither man was asked to give evidence on this aspect. Before the trial, Dr Matheson, the Brixton Prison Medical Officer, had prepared a report on Bentley. His conclusions were that Bentley was sane, fit to plead to the indictment, fit to stand his trial. In fact, from the age of five, Derek Bentley suffered continually from epilepsy. Between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, his IQ was assessed at 66, indicating a mental age of fen and a feeble-minded condition. He was totally illiterate. At the age of seventeen, he was examined by the head of psychological medicine at Guy's hospital, Dr James Monroe. Dr Monroe's conclusions were that Bentley was feeble-minded and that his intellectual retardation was the result for congenital lack of intelligence. At the age of eighteen, Bentley had been given a National Service medical. After intelligence tests and a psychiatric examination, Bentley was placed in the lowest possible grade and exempted from National Service. By declaring that Bentley was it to plead, Dr Matheson was stating that the youth had the ability to challenge jurors, examine witnesses, instruct counsel, follow the evidence and make a proper defence. No mention of Bentley's true condition was made at any time during the Old Bailey trial. Cassels made no use whatsoever of the vast amount of medical evidence on Bentley that had been collated by his solicitor. Neither did he refer at any stage of the trial to Matheson's report on Bentley. During a recent interview, he stated that he had never seen Matheson's report. The state is obliged by law to furnish a copy of this document to defence counsel. One particular point that the prosecuting counsel, Christmas Humphreys, made during his closing speech was... HUMPHREYS:; At no time, or for one moment, throughout the whole of that twenty or twenty-five minutes did Bentley make a sound, either by shouting to Craig or even to the police officers, to show that his mind had ceased to be with Craig and that he was trying to stop Craig shooting and to throw away the gun. NARRATOR: Christopher Craig recently recounted a particular incident on the roof that ironically counter-points the prosecution counsel's remarks. For Christ's sake, Chris, what's got into you? Don't come any closer, you'll get it too And what are you trying to do? Sneak round and get the gun? What's got into you, Chris? Get back or I'll shoot you, Derek! Go on, get hack! It's no good. He won't listen. Craig's counsel, John Parris, had been anxious initially to establish that Craig did not reload his gun during the battle. Unwittingly, Parris established something that had far greater meaning. PARRIS: Well, what other shots were there? I should say there were six or seven other shots. Before the fatal shot? Before the fatal shot, yes. (SCOFFING) Now, do I understand you correctly? There are six or seven other shots in addition to the ones that you told My Lord and the jury about? Yes, that's so. And you have not said a word about these shots until a few moments ago. -Have you, Officer? No. NARRATOR: There is no doubt whatsoever that, prior to the death of PC Miles, Craig had fired only four shots. The only other people with guns in the roof area were policemen. Dr David Haler was the pathologist who had carried out the post-mortem on the body of PC Miles. In evidence, he described the fatal wound as one that had been caused by a bullet of large calibre. He was not asked to define the term 'large calibre' more precisely. The fatal bullet was not, and never has been, produced. At 12:30pm, after considering their verdict for seventy-five minutes, the jury returned to Number Two Court Members of the jury, -are you agreed upon your verdict? -FOREMAN: We are. Do you find the prisoner Christopher Craig guilty or not guilty of murder? Guilty. Do you find the prisoner Derek William Bentley guilty or not guilty of murder? Guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. You find both prisoners guilty, and is that the verdict of you all? It is. Christopher Craig, you stand convicted of murder. Have you anything to say why sentence should not be passed according to law? Derek William Bentley, you stand convicted of murder. Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed according to law? (CROWD MURMURING) Derek William Bentley, you are nineteen years of age, it is my duty to pass on you the only sentence that the law can pass for the crime of wilful murder. The sentence of the court upon you is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence, to a place of execution, and there you'll suffer death by hanging and your body be buried within the precincts of the prison in which you shall be last confined before your execution. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. BAILIFF: Amen Take him down. Christopher Craig, you are under nineteen, but, in my judgement and evidently in the judgement of the Jury, you are the more guilty of the two. Your heart was filed with hate and you murdered a policeman, without thought of his wife, his family or himself. And never once have you uttered a word of sorrow for what you have done. I can only sentence you to be detained until Her Majesty's pleasure be known. I should tell the Secretary of State, when forwarding the recommendation of the jury in Bentley's Case, that you are, in my opinion, one of the most dangerous young criminals who has ever stood in that dock. And it is quite obvious that the people of this country will not be safe if you are out of prison. I shall recommend a time, which I suggest to the Secretary of State, that you shall be kept in confinement. The sentence upon you is that you be kept in strict custody until the pleasure of Her Majesty be known. Take him down. Merry Christmas, son We brought you some fruit. Ta! Happy Christmas, Derek. GUARD: I'm sorry, Mr Bentley, you won't be allowed to leave that fruit. “Why not? -GUARD: It's prison regulations, Miss. My son's a condemned man. He's allowed anything he wants. Well, I'm sorry Mr Bentley, if I had my way, he could have it But it's just not allowed. MR BENTLEY: What's the matter with these bloody people? When he was at Brixton, we couldn't find out who gave him a good hiding. Now he's at Wandsworth he can't have any fruit! Don't worry, Dad, Dennis'll eat it. -How's Mum? -Oh, she's fine. She's stayed behind to answer the phone. I can't get over that, us with a phone! Oh, and don't forget the secretaries. Believe me, son, we need them. You should see the piles of letters we're getting. We've started organising the petition. Dad wants to get a thousand people to sign it A thousand? There ain't that many people in Norbury! No! Not just Norbury, son, all over the British Isles! You'd be surprised how many people have taken an interest in you. I can't see why they're doing it. Because they don't think you should die. - Ain't gonna die, Dad. -No All that's a load of cobblers. I might have to do a few years in borstal. Hey, did I tell you I got my own bath in here? -No! -Right there in the room, -just like a hotel. -(LAUGHING) -Who washes your back? -(LAUGHING) I got a couple of warders keep me company all the time. They even stay with me when I'm kipping. I keep beating them at cards, but I can't beat them 10 the door! (MR BENTLEY LAUGHING) Now then, let's see what we've got here, eh, Dennis? -Yes, Mum -(SNIFFLING) Looks as though someone's sent a present for Derek Yeah. -Should we open it? -Yes. It's kind. Isn't that kind? DENNIS: Yes. It's nice paper. DENNIS: Yes. "Your son needs this." (SOBBING) Oh, my God. Take it easy on me at the appeal, Frank. (CHUCKLING) I don't think you've got anything to worry about. Even if you lose the appeal, I'm quite sure the Home Secretary will reprieve Bentley. I don't think he will. I don't think Bentley should be reprieved. He deserves to hang. NARRATOR: There were two grounds upon which Frank Cassels appealed on behalf of Bentley. First, (NARRATOR READING) The only reference Lord Goddard had made to Bentley's defence during his forty-five minute speech had been... Bentley's defence is, " didn't know he had a gun, "I deny that I said, 'Let him have it, Chris', " didn't know he was going to shoot and I didn't think he would." NARRATOR: In the opinion of the appeal judges, Lord Goddard's summing up had been a model of perfection. They could find no fault with it (MAN READING) The first ground of the appeal, therefore, was accordingly dismissed. The second ground was more unusual. In fact, it was unique. (NARRATOR READING) As Bentley had been under arrest for at least twenty-five minutes when PC Miles was killed, it was highly pertinent to question whether this fact affected Bentley's culpability. Commenting on Frank Cassel's complaint that Lord Goddard had failed completely to discuss this aspect during his summing up, the senior appeal judge, Mr Justice Croom John is on said, (MAN READING) Giving judgement on the second ground of appeal, Mr Justice Croom Johnson said, (MAN READING) Almost every word of that part of the judgement is inaccurate, as can be seen by a transcription of the material parts of the evidence. The judgement of Mr Justice Croom Johnson was, therefore not an accurate version of the evidence, and the basis on which the second ground of appeal was rejected was wholly wrong. On the evidence of both defendants, Bentley was under arrest at the crucial time. On the evidence of four policemen, Bentley was under arrest In the opinion of Lord Goddard Bentley was under arrest. In the opinion of everybody who has ever written or commented upon this case, Bentley was under arrest Before the trial, Bentley had been sent to the Maudsley Hospital for an EEG examination. The examination was carried out by Doctor, now Professor, Sir Denis Hill Sir Denis is regarded as a world authority on human brainwaves. In the opinion of Sir Denis, an opinion shared by many members of the medical profession, if a person suffers from epilepsy, the disease can never safely be ruled out from being a contributing factor or indeed the direct cause of a crime such as the one of which Bentley had been found guilty. On the 24th of January, Sir Denis wrote to the Home Secretary, leaving Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in no doubt of the implications of hanging an epileptic. Hello? Yeah. Who? Okay. Harry Procter. Hello? Yeah. -(DOOR BELL RINGING) -Yeah No, I'M go. I need to stretch my legs, dear. (GROANING) Look, we got over a hundred thousand signatures. If that doesn't get him off, nothing will. What? (DOOR OPENING) It's the Sunday Pictorial. If he writes a last letter, they want to buy it Yeah. (DOOR CLOSING) Why? No, no. I know there's less than forty-eight hours to go. We haven't given up hope, even if you have (PHONE SLAMMING) That... That was a young reporter, Will. MR BENTLEY: Hmm? Well, tell him to come in and have a cup of tea. He's gone. He just wanted confirmation of the news. What news? He said his paper's been advised that Maxwell Fyfe has refused to grant a reprieve. Surely we'd be the first to know? Why, course we would, love. Well, there might be something in that lot. (CHUCKLING) No. They wouldn't send it through the post! We'd get a special messenger from the Home Office at least. (MRS BENTLEY MUMBLING) It won't be there. OHMS. Oh, my God. Here, Will. (INAUDIBLE) "I am directed by the Secretary of State “to inform you that he has given careful consideration "to the petition submitted by you on behalf of your son, Derek Bentley. "And I am to express to you "his deep regret, "that after considering all circumstances of the case, "he has failed to discover any sufficient ground "to Justify him in advising Her Majesty "to interfere with the due course of the law." It was posted on Saturday. It's been lying in the post box all over the weekend. (IRIS AND MRS BENTLEY SOBBING) (VOICE BREAKING) Dad. I'm not aff aid to die because I'm innocent. As long as you keep your chins up, I'll keep mine up, whatever happens. Everybody knows I didn't kill Mr Miles. I've got nothing on my conscience. I know I did wrong going with Craig, but I never knew what he was going to do. I wouldn't kill anything, Dad. You know that, don't you? Course we do, son. Help me. Please help me. NARRATOR: On the evening of the 26th of January, 1953, Sydney Silverman, Member of Parliament for Nelson and Colne, tabled a motion calling for a reprieve. The motion was to be debated the next day. However, the motion was removed from the order paper on the instructions of the Speaker. For ninety minutes, a succession of Labour MPs tried in vain to persuade the Speaker to change his mind and alter his ruling. But the efforts of Sydney Silverman, Reginald Paget, Leslie Hale, Desmond Donnelly and Aneurin Bevan, were all in vain. The Speaker ruled that while a capital case is pending, the matter should not be discussed by the house. In essence, the Speaker's ruling was, "You can only discuss whether or not Bentley should hang, 'aff er he has hanged.' With less than 24 hours to go before Bentley was to die, Dr Denis Hill had still received no reply from the Home Office. In desperation, he phoned them, requesting permission to make public the knowledge he had concerning Bentley's mental condition. Dr Hill was obliged to take this step because he had obtained the knowledge whilst acting on behalf of the State. He was advised by the Home Office that to make such details public would not be in the public interest. -BENTLEY: Dear Mum and Dad, -(PEN SCRATCHING) I was glad to see you on the visit today, but I was a little disappointed that Rita couldn't come. I got the rosary in the letter and I saw the photo of the dogs. Iris locked quite nice surrounded with all those animals. I couldn't keep the photo 'cause it was a newspaper cutting. I told you, Mum, it'd be very difficult to write this letter because I can't think of anything to say except that you've all been wonderful, the way you've worked for me Thank Rita for writing to me, and tell her I'm thinking of her. Don't forget what I told you today. Always keep your chin up. Tell Pop not to grind his teeth. I... I mustn't forget to thank Lil and Bert for writing to me and coming to see me. Give my love to them both and anyone else that we knew. Tell Ronnie to keep away from the boys and stay on his own It's me mate. I met Chris through him. I hope Dad has some more televisions in. Forgot to ask him how things were on the visit Dad and I used to have some fun on that one of Leslie's. He certainly had some spare parts for it. (SCOFFS) Bloody thing blew up. Ta. Oh, and Dad, don't let my cycle frames get rusty. Might come in handy one day. 'Cause Old Sally's got a cracked frame. That's what I call my dad's bike. And I want you to change it before something happens to you. Oh, and Dad, keep a sf riot eye on Dennis if he does anything wrong. I don't think he will. But you never know how little things can get you into trouble. If he does, wallop him so he won't be able to sit down for three weeks. I'm trying to give you good advice because of my experiences. I'll tell you what, though, Mum. One day, the truth of this story has got to come out. As I said in the visiting box, one day, a lot of people are going to get into trouble. I think you know who those people are. What do you think, Mum? This letter may sound a bit solemn, but I'm still keeping my chin up as I want all the family to do. Don't let anything happen to the dogs and cats. Look after them as you always have. I hope Laurie and Iris get married all right. I'd like to give them my blessing. Be nice to have a brother-in-law like him. Could have some fun together. We could've gone around to the club and drunk ourselves to a standstill on the great occasion of their getting married. Tell him to lob out my flower. Tell him to keep my mac clean, and my tie. Laurie and I used to have some fun together by the pond till four o'clock in the morning, by the cafe. Always caught Laurie to pay for the pies. Never caught me once. That'll be all for now. I'll sign this myself. Lots of love. NARRATOR: At 8pm, on the evening of the 27th January, a deputation of six MPs presented a petition, signed by two hundred MPs to Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. They again urged him to reprieve Bentley. The Home Secretary listened to their arguments for forty-five minutes and two hours later, he informed them of his conclusions. (PANICKED BREATHING) BENTLEY: (SOBBING; I didn't tell him. I never told him to shoot that policeman. NARRATOR: Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, Hansard, 1948.
