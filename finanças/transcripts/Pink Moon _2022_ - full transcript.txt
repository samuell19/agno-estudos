PINK MOON I'm here. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, honey. Did you get the cutlery? - You've got everything? - Yes. Red or white, guys? - Where are the kids? - Dad didn't want them here. - And we couldn't find a babysitter. - Did you leave them by themselves? - Of course not. - You and Mom used to do that, right? You'd go to the movies while we were sleeping. - Yes, sometimes we did that. - Luckily my mother was able to babysit. Why weren't they allowed to join us, Dad? Dad, can you get us some water? - Dad? - It's a bit more quiet this way. Nice cooking, Dad. Are you sure you've divided it equally? Trick of the trade. Keet and Noah do this all day. - It's not that bad, is it? - You think so? Nice to know I have one and a quarter of fishcake. - Do you want one? - Is that red curry spicy? - The menu said only one pepper. - Don't be fooled. I had a chicken cashew with oyster sauce and it was insanely spicy. - Insanely spicy? It wasn't. - Where did I eat that? - Top Thai? Thailicious? - Can I have some of that? - Here you go. - Thank you, love. - Iris, so how's the water? - It's going well. - Any exciting new developments? - Not really. There's a conference I'm going to. - Where? - South Africa. - You're going to South Africa? - Yes. Poor me. You're going to South Africa? By yourself? Guys, could I have your attention? I invited you... because there's something I've needed to get off of my chest for some time. - Have you met someone? - No. I love you all. But I need to tell you something and I hope you will respect my choice. Even though you might not like it. I decided that my next birthday will be my last. You're not celebrating your birthday anymore? 75 is a beautiful age, but I won't be turning 76. I'm done. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Why? - Because I'm still good now. But I don't want to be dependent on you or on doctors or anything like that. I've had this powder for this purpose for a few years. - A few years? - Yes. - Why haven't you told us sooner? - I had to be sure myself first. - So now you are? - Yes, now I am. I just got a new supply, the other one expired. - I don't want to live anymore. - You don't want to? Sometimes I don't want to do something either. Keet and Noah never want to do things. We all have that. - It's no reason to kill yourself. - Well, killing yourself... - That's what it is. - I'm done with it, Iris. - Dad, are you ill? - No. I'm sorry. But not telling you would have been... Now you can get used to the idea. - Get used to it? - Yeah. But Dad, is this even allowed? That powder I have, makes it very humanely. It's being used quite a lot. I don't understand this at all. You're healthy. You have Iris, you have me. You're not in a wheelchair. You babysit every Tuesday. You have grandchildren. You live in a fantastic house. - You're independent. Why? - I told you, I'm done living. What kind of bullshit argument is that? You're not a fucking child. - Iris, come on. - What? I don't get it. I don't get it. And I don't want to fucking get it. I understand this is a lot to take in. There's no such thing as the right time. You're either too late or too early. I'd rather be too early. That's why I want to check out in a couple of months. Check out? Come on, Dad. Life isn't a fucking bus ride. Maybe we should let it sink in for a little... Yes. Check out... Seriously, Dad? Can I put this here? Can't you sleep? - Coco, please go to sleep. - Are you terrorizing your mom? Is this really the only thing that works? The only thing that keeps Coco quiet. Already a terrible ecological footprint It's a little late for an abortion. - Jan wants to die. - What? - You're joking, right? - No. For real? Come here. - It's green. - How is he going to do it? Apparently, he's had this powder for years to kill himself with. - What? - Yes. - Is that even allowed? - I think it's illegal. Lau... Just go around, idiot. Come on. - Do you want me to go and talk to him? - Do you think you can change his mind? Yes. Listen, if you want me to, I'll do it. I will make him change his mind. By force, if I have to. Damn... - Did you drop it? - I don't have it, but there's one. You can use that. - Have you told the kids? - No. This has nothing to do with you. You shouldn't think that. - Oh, I didn't think that. - Shit, I'm sorry. This says something about Jan. Not about you, not about Ivan. That's all. - Do you think he'll go through with it? - Yes. Yes. I think so. - Put that stuff away. - How do you feel about it? For you two it's a big shock of course. But try to see it from Jan's perspective. That's difficult, of course. Then it's kind of beautiful that someone can keep control. To be honest I'm proud of your father that he has the courage to do this. The timer is on. Too bad if you don't finish. We have to go. He has mentioned before he doesn't want to experience deterioration. - That he'd rather be spared all that. - Pretty legitimate, right? - I never heard any of this. - Iris, you've heard him say this. I shouldn't have come. - Are you leaving already? - Bye, guys. Bye, Keet. Bye, Noah. Sound like the character of a sitcom. Eventually we will all drown if we don't adapt soon. Talk about Adaptive Delta Management... How was your weekend, Iris? Strange. My father told us he doesn't want to live anymore. He wants to die. Just like that. - Jesus. - I'm sorry. Smells nice. Is this your famous lasagne? It is. - Thanks for picking me up. - Don't be silly. You can't go by bike with that lasagne. Can you imagine? Right... Honey, have you got my bag? Hey. Let me take your bag. - Another box. - But that's something else, I think. - I think those are figurines. - What are those things? You could make a little side river, for instance. Here. Let's watch a movie. The longer it takes, the less you can watch. Come on. No, come on. Noah, you too. - How did it go with Lola? - No trouble at all. - She's sleeping. - Such a doll. - A real sweetheart. - Lovely. - Dad, do you want some? - Please. Looks great. - Everything quiet? - Yes, for now. - Looks delicious. - Elizabeth? It's lukewarm. That's not good. It needs to go back in the oven. Let's put it back. Will you manage? - Did you check out that website? - Yes, but it's too complicated. I like it more simple. I want to make the end as easy as possible for me, but for you as well. That's why I'd like to pick a suitable day with you. Around my birthday, as you already know. It can be on November 28 itself. Or a few days after that. But I'd rather not wait too long. What do you think about the day itself? - That works. - Yes? The day itself is most convenient for us. - What about you, Iris? - No, that's really fucking inconvenient. - Mom? - Yes, honey? - It's not working. - Just press play. - I've already tried that. - Play. - I've tried it ten times. - Not ten times, just once. It's my work laptop. Everything is on it. I'll have a look. I already discussed a few things with Ivan. I also think it's a good idea to make some kind of playbook. I found on the Internet that many families use such a playbook. I think it's a good idea to use one too. Sorry about that. It's working now. There's so much to take care of. Cancel subscriptions, the house, the furniture... Cremation or burial? Which casket, which urn? Songs, speeches, obituaries. I've also talked about the house with someone. It's a smart move to sell it now. Then you'll have less inheritance tax to pay. But are we really doing this all of a sudden? Is this all normal, suddenly? Dad, do you want us to be there, when you kill yourself? - Iris. Can we discuss that another time? - I'd rather be told now. Iris, I don't know yet. Is that okay? I thought you two already planned everything out. That's not the point. I don't want to put you in danger when I'm gone. - You'll still celebrate your birthday? - Yes. - And everyone will know? - No, of course not. - It'll just be a birthday party. - A farewell party. Hand me your plate, Dad. I'll serve you some. So, as you know, our company has the honor to be represented at the upcoming International water conference, and Iris will be our junior speaker. Yes... Hi! I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about our case study "Water for Life". More than a half of all the refugees are climate refugees. And with these models, we can secure water and the access to water in the driest corners of the world. And by doing so, for example the life expectancy of a man in Turkana, which is one of the driest region in Kenya, can increase by ten years. Like normally, he wouldn't have lived past 50. Can you imagine 50? That's the age you move out of your parent's place here in the Netherlands. So, with this management we can secure life and equality of life for our future generations. Unless we don't want that and we just prefer to die. Back to the model... So, let me go back. We talk about the stream flow routine and there are several... Wait. It starts with a lot of guitar and then... It's actually really simple. Wait, do it again. One more time. Wait, let's see. - It's not getting it. - It's been in my head all day. - Where is it from? - It's in my head. I don't remember. - Something from the past. - Wait, do it again. - Guitar first... - You have to sing it. And in comes the piano and then it starts from the top. Hold it, please. Thank you. Hi. - Do you know anything about music? - Yes, I do. Would it be okay if I hum something, for you to listen to? - Sorry? - I can't remember the name of a song. Sure. Well, first guitar, guitar, guitar, and then... And then again... Tricky. Two songs come to mind. How Can We Hang On To A Dream by Tim Hardin. And maybe, because of the chords, Cause by Rodriguez. That's well-known now, because of the documentary. But I'm not sure. - Is this about your father? - Can you email them to me? - What you said at lunch... - Can you email them? Yes, of course. You've reached Laura... Jesus Lau, what hopeless nitwit writes this crap? And did you see my room? We have the space. It's a Denon. We'll talk about it later. See you in a bit. Hey. - Didn't Elizabeth feel like joining? - No, she thought... Hold this. She thought this was something we should do together. I thought she had a point. - Is she at home with the kids? - Yes. - Hey, Dad. - Hi. Of course it's fun when the children come along... but they have their own opinion about everything, you know. - And Elizabeth too, of course. - Yes. It's really bizarre, but I think I'm starting to get used to it. - What about you? - No. Hi, Dad. The idea is to put stickers on the stuff we want to have. I bought some stickers. I'll take green, you take red. If there are two stickers on something, we'll flip a coin. - Were they on sale? - No. You haven't confirmed a date yet. Could you please do that? - What, now? - Yes, so we can get it over with. Sure. Alright... Let's see... - On the day of the party? - For instance. - Sure, I'm available. - You are? - Yes. - Good. We've set a date. That gives peace of mind, right Dad? I'll start downstairs. It's me again. I'm going downstairs for the steel lamps. No, not the sofas. - Would you like something to drink? - No, I'm okay. Yeah, I figured. I think I'll start downstairs as well. - Shall I go out for a bit? - No... No, it's probably better. - Where did Dad go? - I don't know. Mom's clothes are still there, did you know? No. - I think I want to be there. - Where? - Dad's final moments. - You can't. Dad said so himself. Nobody needs to know. We can't let him go alone, can we? - Were you done upstairs? - Yes. - That's fast. - Yes. I don't have to talk everything through with someone. - Hey. Are we going on a trip? - No. I'm moving in with you. Dad. How about that? - Do you want some coffee? - No, I'll be right there. Dad. - Are you buying that? - Sorry? That glass? - Well, I... - No? Get off. I'm talking to you. You're jumping on a sofa that's not yours. What's wrong? Do you let her jump on the sofa at home too? - Why? - This is my sofa. - Then why is it here? - There's been a misunderstanding. My brother should've just called me. And that gives you the right to talk like this? - It does. - Get a hold of yourself. Look who's talking. Keep an eye on that brat. Excuse me? Liv, come here. This woman is not right in her mind. That's what you get in these places. Miss... - Check-out. - Well, this is mine. Let's have a look. That will be 3.50. No, this is really mine. I got this from my father when I turned four. - Ben. - Miss, what's going on? This is my doll carriage and I'm taking it with me. - You can't just go around taking things. - Just take things? This, those glasses and a sofa are all my family's. - And I'm taking it back now. - I'm sorry. I understand that this is very annoying, but I'm taking back my stuff. I can't make any exceptions. - How much was it again? - 3.50. - Can I pay by card? - That will be 50 cents extra. Shall we leave it at that? Well Dad, you would've been a great actor. Come on, get up. Dad. How was that for you guys? Yeah... Fun. - And for you, Ivan? - I thought this one went pretty well. I need some practice with that yoghurt. It has to go in one go, or it'll go wrong. - Should I get more yoghurt? - Yes. What's the first thing we need to do when we find you in the morning? I just described that. Yes, but it helps me to repeat it, just to double check. The most important thing is to make sure that Dad is dead. That we don't touch him. Then we call the doctor and they call the police. That order is crucial. How can we be sure that Dad is dead if we can't touch him? Why don't we put on the gloves earlier? Now there are fingerprints in the hall. Yes... You're absolutely right. Then we take those gloves with us. We'll put them on outside on the sidewalk... and hang an extra few in a bag in the garden. That'll serve as a reminder... There will be fingerprints all over the house. There's just been a party. Good point. But it's all over the Internet that you have to do it this way. It's quite common to make a video to say I do it voluntarily... that nobody's forcing me and that I'm alone. But of course that's also in my will, which is on the table here. Yes, good one. What do you think? - I feel like having a beer. - I'd like a beer too. Do you want to practice that video or do you want to do it alone? I'd like a beer too. - Hi. - Hi, good afternoon. We are very interested in the house. So I thought I'd just try. - It's for sale, right? - Yes. - Why don't you come in? - Wow, if I may? I would love to. - Of course you can. - That's great. We're from Amsterdam. We're with five. How wonderful. It'll be full of life then. This is the hall. The floor is glass mosaic. But if you think it's old-fashioned, you can just replace it. - Right, Dad? - What? That the floor in the hallway is glass mosaic, but replacing it would be easy. Sure, I guess so. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Let's go to the kitchen. It's completely up-to-date with the latest kitchen design standards. There's a nice window here too. Refrigerator is new. Ice maker. Cupboard, which was designed by the architect especially for this house. This is just one of those amazing 70s homes... that'll never get boring, because of its design. Right, Ivan? - Yes. - This lady is interested. Shouldn't we let the realtor handle that? Why? She's here now, isn't she? - Well... - Come on. Let's go into the garden. The garden is very secluded. There's enough room for all the bikes. Our old swing is still there. Unless my brother has stolen it. No, it's still there. Then we arrive at the terrace. There's lots of grass to play on. Ideal spot for a barbecue. Let's go to the living room. This needs to be lubricated. So, here you have it. Huge space. Beautiful graphic lines. And also a lot of light. Fireplace and double glazing. - It's everything you could ever dream of. - I think... And the cross-trainer, Dad? Is it staying? Yes. It's for sale. Top of the line. We'll work that out. - I think it would be good to come back... - No need. Have a look around. And here's the man who lived here half his life. If you have any more questions, this is Jan, my father. He is going to die here on November 28. Right where we are standing now. Is that convenient in terms of the moment of transfer? Or do you have to sell your house first? But that's really a formality, with that crazy housing market these days. - Shall I give you the realtor's number? - Yes. What? I'm really sorry about this. My sister has a... What? Jesus, stop it. Stop it. I knew it was a terrible idea for you to move back in here. Oh yeah? And you'd rather help Dad into his grave. That's not true. We were supposed to stick to our agreements. Well, here's an update. I'm here. You think you can change his mind be spending enough time with him. No way. Hey, Ivan. What are you doing here? Good question. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? You're the one who wants things to stay the same. What are you doing here? Spending time with Dad, while I still can. Is that what you want too, Dad? - You see how much you're appreciated. - Let's be nice to each other, guys. We just stick to the playbook. It gives us peace of mind. Maybe this is very hard for you to realize, but it's not all about you. Guys... You're one hell of a guy. Really. Ier, I've got beer. - Where's your glass? - I don't know. Here, hold this. I'll get it. - Why do we never do this anymore? - Because we're fucking old. Iris. You there? Yes. Hey, I'm going home. - Just stay. Coco is asleep anyway. - Yes, but I have to go to work tomorrow. But it's Wednesday night. You said nothing would change. They're going to close soon. Then we'll just go somewhere else. No, I'm really tired. I'm afraid I'm too old. - No, you're not. - I am. My shift starts in a few hours. Party pooper. Iris. - Yes? - You're not with that toddler, are you? - No, why? - That guy is really not your type. Ier... - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Yes. - I'll call you. - Yeah. - Have fun. - Bye. - Maybe he just needs sex. - What? My dad wants to kill himself, but maybe he just needs sex. What the fuck? Why are you talking about your dad right now? I don't know, I just thought about it. Stop please. I have to go. I have school tomorrow. Come on. This is every guy's wet dream. No, it's really not. Sorry. It's okay. What are you doing? - Will you let go of me? - No. - Come on, let go of me. - No. I want to leave. I don't think you want to leave at all. Okay. Let go of me. Fuck. Sorry. Are you okay? You want me to get some ice? - How can I help you? - I got a call. Right. I'll call the manager. - Two coffees. - Thank you. Iris, I'm here. I hear you. I ordered you a coffee. Coffee? Will you get up, please? No. Did you know that they design these places in a way that you don't want to stick around. Purposely shitty proportions between the seats and the table. Lights way too bright. I guess they forgot... that if you're lying down, it's not too bad. - And two buckets. There you go. - Thank you. Enjoy. Dad, buckets? I think it's nice, though. That you moved back home. - Is this 2009? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I help? - Here, take this one. - Isn't it a little early for all this? - I don't have time later this week. So I thought I'd do some preparations. - Together with Lola? - Yes. Lola is helping out, because she refuses to sleep in her own bed lately. Then you start to cry. Here, look at this. This has to go in the fridge. It's the yoghurt Dad asked for. I've checked. The sell-by date is the 14th. Iris, we also need to buy snacks for Dad's birthday. Would you do that? - Sure. - Thanks. Iris and Grandpa are going shopping. That's nice, isn't it? Yes, sweetie. Grandpa has a birthday coming up. Don't you have to turn right for the wholesale store? No. We have to go straight ahead. - Iris, you have to turn right here. - No. We have to go straight ahead. What's this, Iris? Don't worry. I brought you a bag. Everything is in it. Toothbrush, passport, clean underwear. I don't want to travel. Things are happening against my will too. - What about Ivan? - What about him? He'll go mad. I don't want this, Iris. How long are we going for? And where are we going? - The mountains. - The mountains? That's madness. Not at all. We have to go through Germany, Austria and then you're there. Thanks. How long did you go for? It was either a week or a year. So I took a year. Are you coming? Let's see. Oh, yeah. Will you grab your bag? - Here you go. - Thanks. Wait up, Iris. We're nearly there, Dad. Come on. Let's see. Ten, nine, eight, seven... shit. Six, five... four, three, two, one. Today is a birthday, hooray, hooray I clearly can tell it is yours we all are so happy for you and so we'll sing this song for you: we wish you many years, hooray we wish you many years, hooray we wish you many years, hooray Congratulations, Dad. I'm sorry it's a bit different from what you had in mind. I have a present for you. Well, I'll be damned. I can't believe you kept this. We were supposed to go here when I turned 16. Yes, but then Mom got ill for the first time. And now here we are. You also wrote something in it. 'To be great, be whole. Exclude nothing, exaggerate nothing that is not you. Be whole in everything. Put all you are into the smallest thing you do. So, in each lake, the moon shines with splendor... because it blooms up above.' Thank you, honey. Here. Why do you do that? - Were you spying on me? - Yes. It's good for the circulation. And you needed that? Well, I don't know. I just like it. You just like it. You just do whatever you feel like doing. Whatever pops into your head. It doesn't matter what others think. Dad. Isn't there just something you really want to do? - Like eating oysters at La Coupole? - No. Go to a Bob Dylan concert? I saw he's performing soon. No. - To the sea? - No. - Sex? - No. - With a very beautiful woman. - No. - Escort? - No. - I'll pay. - No. Don't you want to talk to someone? A priest? Confession? Are you out of your mind? What do you want then? Nothing, Iris. I really don't need anything. Then why can't you explain it? Because you won't understand it anyway. - So it's me. Because I can't empathize. - No. - That's what you said. - No, it's not. I'm saying that no matter what I say, you could never see it my way. - You don't know that at all. - Yes, I do. - Give it a try. - No. - I'm not worth a try. - Iris, you're so full of life. You could never feel the way I do. The rotten thing is you're alone. You're born like that and you die like that. And in the meantime it just shows we can't see things from other perspectives. That's not true. Not if you try. - You just shut me out. - I'm standing here. I'm talking to you. - But you're not saying anything. - I am, but you're not listening. - You're deliberately ostracizing me. - What are you saying? Do you even know what ostracize means? It's this. That's what it feels like. - Of course you wouldn't understand. - No, I don't. Fuck off. Ass. You need to let me go. I feel like I'm miles away from everything. I'm done living. I miss Mom, Iris. I miss the days with her. I can't anymore. Where is she then? Is she waiting for you up there? I don't know. - But I know she's not here. - But I am. I am. Thank you so much. Here's to your father. To Jan. Hey, Noah. Who needs such an enormous house? He'll make a killing in the current market. Or he could rent it out. - Gerard, do you have a lighter? - Yeah, sure. Just rent it out. If you rent it out... - But it needs a lot of work. - It just seems easier. Thanks. - Boo. - Who is this? Are you sneaking up on me? Hey. I'm coming to get you. - Iris. - Keet, are you coming? You're leaving. Oh, you're leaving. - I'm leaving. - Yes, okay. - Call me, okay? - Yes, sure. - Okay, bye. - Make sure you call. - Jan, we're off. - Wait. Can you take Lola from me? Hey, thanks for coming. - See you soon. - Thanks, Jan. You'll find your way out? Are you going to sleep soon? Are you going to sleep? Come to Mommy. Bye, sweetie. Bye. Come on, sweetie. - Keet, are you coming? - Coming. You go to the car. See you in a bit. - Keet, are you coming? - Did you hug Grandpa? - Come here, you. - Bye, Grandpa. - Bye, sweetheart. - Bye. Bye. See you tonight. Drive safe. Iris. What is that then? It's an antiemetic. You need to build it up. I started it yesterday. - And what's that? - That's the powder. I can't do it. - It's okay. - Sure? - Are you staying? - Yes. Did that song ever come to mind, actually? No. My life is done. My life is complete. And now the time has come for my self-chosen end. As you can see, I am all alone. No one is helping me with this. I leave a farewell letter and a last will. PINK MOON
