All were born out of the scorching heat... Beings that create and those that destroy, coexisting, yet mutually opposed... Both created the entire universe... Finally to return to the scorching heat... My wings are full of images of holding back They are still weak but I'm sure I can fly Oh My Love Mei, Mei... still not ready? Wait, wait! This one? Or this one? Mei-chan, which looks better on me? How should I know? Taichi! Breakfast. I believe what we did was right. If we hadn't gone into battle, things would be much worse than they are. If you don't eat fast, Agumon'll gobble up everything. Oh no! You guys! You're still here? You're still eating? I even had seconds. Morning. I'm sorry! We'll be right down. Hang on a sec! What's with all the luggage? Towels and stuff. No, no! This hot spring has everything. How many years has it been since we went to a hot spring? Our first time, we forgot to decide when we'd get out of the baths. I got out of the water so early! But you, Hime-chan, were in the bath for surprisingly long. I know today we're going out of duty. Nothing else. I have the latest analysis. By comparing the areas of distortion and the Infected Digimons' movement patterns, a hypothesis was reached. "The Infected Digimons show up to hunt someone in particular"? They say "someone in particular" as if they didn't know. I know. They're after one of them, or one of their partner Digimons. Hurry up, Mei! Sorry we're so late. Don't worry, you're right on time. Morning. Good morning. G... Good morning! Th... Thank you for inviting us today. You said it! No need to be so formal. Yeah, it's your welcome party! Right. See? We're last! Hey, I'm sorry. Good morning! I should've called to wake you up. Not like I overslept! Is Joe senpai the only one left? Joe's studying. Gomamon! I guess Joe can't make it? He does have exams. One day hanging out won't make a difference! Oh well. Anyway, shall we go? Alright guys, jump on in here. In turns, guys. Why not bring them normally? It's no fun hanging out if they're in the computer. Is it okay, Mimi? But... Yes, especially with such good weather. I want to go with Sora! I'll be good, Hikari! Gatomon! Being obvious might even make us less conspicuous. Takeru! Behave yourself. Of course! Okay? Can you imitate a stuffed animal? Sure, watch me! It's decided. Fine. Please be careful, everyone. We'll be quiet. Don't worry, Koshiro! Okay, to the hot spring! Let's go! Yay! I planned to be sure to enjoy a big bath when I came back to Japan. Tachikawa-san, are you a returnee? Call me Mimi! I was living in America because of my dad's work. Meimei too? Is it your folks? Changing schools. Yes... Why did you call me "Meimei"? Since you're Meiko, so Meimei! Isn't it kind of long? Sounds cute, like a sheep. What? Wait, I... Meiko-san, you'd better watch out for Takeru-kun. You're so mean. "OOEDO-ONSEN MONOGATARl" Wow! Pick whichever you want. Really? I've got it! I wonder if the pattern on this yukata is too plain. But... How about that one? I'll take it! Which yukata did you choose? It's... it's number four. Then how about this obi? Same as mine. Thank you. Here we go! "SUCCESS" "VICTORY!" We arrived safely. Don't worry about anything. Gomamon seems to be having fun too. What... what about our underwear? Just put the yukata on over it. Hikari-chan! Hands up! What? No way. Come on, don't be a wet blanket! "Hands up"? Like this. Let me strip you, girl! Mei, I want to go round and round too! Sora, I do too! Palmon, you have to say "Noooo! Dooon't!" Noooo! Dooon't! Gatomon! Round and round! Hey! You guys! I'm so excited! Mimi, what's that? What's what? Mei, it smells great. Ramen, yakisoba, takoyaki... And shaved ice. Awesome! I know it's exciting. Sorry, sorry. Yay! Hey. Mr. Nishijima! Why are you here? Doesn't it feel wonderful, Yamato? One, two! One, two! Swim with your fingers closed, like your palms are gathering water. Fill your lungs and you'll float. Senpai, that's amazing! Mei, I'm floating! No swimming in the foot bath. I'm sorry... Hey. Hime-chan! You and Meicoomon seem well. We are! Hello. Thanks for the other day. Is she your older sister? Well, she... What is it? She's the lady from the other day! Ah! There she is. Hime-chan! "Hime-chan"? Are you on a date? Is she your girlfriend? Ex, actually. Ouch! That's too much information! No need to be so self-conscious. So you've met Himekawa-san before. Hime-chan, I mean Himekawa-san... ...helped me out a lot when I first came to Tokyo. I think she worried about me since I'm one of the DigiDestined. Who knew? I had pegged her as unapproachable. So beautiful, you know? So the Digimons have been safe being out because you teachers were around? No, this is the only area under patrol. We are a small and elite unit. I see. Even though criticism of the Digimons has gained steam... ...perhaps we have yet to see a great effect on daily life. Wait, you set up a patrol... Ouch! Too hot for you? Yes. No need to worry, all has been calm. We came to keep it that way. Mei-chan, say "aah." Aaah. Like it? I love it! So cute. Is Meicoomon a child? No, Mei-chan is an adult. No way! Just like Gatomon. During evolution, does Meicoomon sprout wings? I don't know. It hasn't happened yet. Really? Hey, after we eat, why don't we play a game? Throwing stars! A competition. Huh? Cafe au lait? Caffe Latte? I hear a festival! Mei! It's so pretty! Mei? Mei-chan! It's okay. You're okay. Mei. Don't run off alone. I won't. You okay? Y... Yes. This kind of place is new to Mei-chan and me. I see. We should have asked where you wanted to go. Sorry. You shouldn't apologize. I should. Making you all come together. No. This trip is actually for my brother and Taichi-san. What? - Takaishi-kun... - Call me Takeru. Takeru-kun and Ishida-kun are brothers? Didn't I tell you? Our folks divorced when we were kids so our last names are different. It's not that we hide it. But you guys are close, that's great. Yeah. Gabumon, you come too! It feels great! No way! Oops, sorry, let me just get my glasses case. C'mon Mei-chan! You said it! I'm coming too! Yes, go help out, Biyomon. We're going in. Oh, it's fabulous! Isn't it? Hey! Wait! Stop that! Oops, I touched you! Unbelievable... What are you up to? Hey! Sora-san, Sora-san! Yes? You're next! Stop it, Mimi-chan! Round and round! You'll get hurt. Meicoomon! It's all fluffy. I want to go in too. Nice and soft. Soft and fluffy. - Oh no! Pretend to be a stuffed animal! - You said it! Here it is. Sorry to keep you waiting... Meiko-san never came back, did she? I wonder if she got lost. Guys! Mei-chan and Biyomon... Geezer. I'm not that old yet. Mr. Nishijima. Tell us more about the Infected Digimons and the Digital World. I don't know much myself. Even being "Mr. Incorporated..."? I'm just a mid-level administrator. You mean you're Himekawa-san's flunky? Impertinent boy. Excuse us! Mimi-san! Don't worry. Mei... I bet we can get out through there. Where are we? Great. We made it back... Daddy! Mei-chan... Meicoomon is with Biyomon, so don't worry. I thought they might put on a show. Who ever heard of animal suits in the bath? I'll go see. Wait, not on your own. We'll just have to barge in. Don't worry, leave it to me! Ladies and gentlemen! I, Mimi Tachikawa, will now sing! I wish Now's our chance. Okay. Please tell me why we are here right away - Mei-chan! - Biyomon! - Sora! - Mei! What are you doing in here?! Thank you. You're welcome. Don't worry. I can't see a thing. See? Completely fogged up. A total success, right Meimei? Ta much. Did you say that meant "thank you"? It's so cute! Get out of here now! Himekawa-san, what do you think? About what? Are they happy or unhappy? What do you think? I want them to be happy. Personal feelings only hinder the mission. You're sure cold. You're too warm to them. Mochizuki-san, are you perhaps from Shimane? I... I'm from Tottori. I was close! My grandmother says "ta much" too. Which one is Tottori? The one with the sand dunes. Shimane's the one with no computers. That was a million years ago. Watch it. I... Only true friends fight. We're not fighting! I hope we can be good friends. And then, Mimi said... Hey. Joe, are you listening? Yeah. He's studying now. Floating is fun! I had a great time. Me too. Everyone made it home safely. No, nothing out of the ordinary. So, guess we can go home too. I guess so. An intense radio disturbance has occurred at Point Tango. Warning signs put the chances of extraordinary disaster at 95%. Grade 1 Management Officers are requested to take measures. I repeat... It's a distortion. Shall we call the DigiDestined? No, they're our trump card. And look at how huge it is. This is ideal for testing the new weapon. We've confirmed it's an extraordinary electronic disaster. Due to the emergency, I request immediate action from the Disaster Reponses Force. We recognize the call for mobilization of government-designated personnel. Commencing disaster countermeasures. Troops, ready arms! Your mark! The electronic disaster ahead. Fire! It's working! Ready second volley! Mr. Nishijima. Ah, you're here. Late again today? It must be rough for you wearing so many hats. Well, not as bad as you guys. Want some? No, thank you. Looks great! Have some manners. Aren't you having any, Sora? Well, it would also be impolite to refuse. I heard that another distortion appeared the night before last... Yes, we took care of it. What? The Infected Digimon? You mean it was small enough that your organization handled it? Or do you mean... Okay, calm down. Thanks for the donuts. Using data of where the distortions have occurred until now, we can speculate the places they may appear in the future. Our plan is to reinforce security in those locations. You're saying we're not needed anymore? No. The Infected Digimons are very likely to continue to appear around here. Please be ever vigilant. Especially you guys. Thank you, sir. Yamato didn't come. Band practice, right? Especially us? I wonder what he meant. Could the Infected Digimons be after us? To prevent potential enemies of the Infected Digimons, they might try to eliminate the DigiDestined and our partner Digimons. What for? I don't know. If it's true, why are they trying to conceal it as well? Either way, it pays to watch out. To keep the partner Digimons safe while we're out, I'll increase security in the server room. "SCHOOL FESTIVAL PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETING 4pm" Meimei! I didn't know you were on the planning committee too. We drew lots... The School Festival Planning Committee will run a temporary cafe... ...to host our guests. Please refer to the materials we handed out with details of last year's cafe. Isn't this a drag? And now, would anyone like to nominate themselves as person in charge? I would! If there's no one else... I'm Mimi Tachikawa, 1st year, Class C. I want to make it a cafe like "DATERS"! What is that? You don't know? It's popular in America. I'll put it on the monitor. That's it! Staff dress like cheerleaders and sometimes put on a dance show. It's so much fun! Eating there is a blast, so I'm sure it's fun to work there too. I want to make it a cafe where everyone is happy! I'd never... Me neither. No problem! It'll make everyone happy! Okay, okay! Well... if there are no other candidates or proposals... Great! I'll do my very best. Thanks so much, everyone! This one's so cute. I love it. Mimi-san, you're amazing. Huh? How come? A 1st year volunteering, doing and saying as you please. I can't do any of that. How come? You should! Most girls can't. Why? Well... Honestly I don't like holding myself back for the sake of others. Being quiet in front of people means you're just complaining later. I detest it. When people have something to say they should just speak up. Hey, how about this one? Is it a belly warmer? It's a skirt! Meimei, try it on! No! I mean, I... It's too short. That's the best part. I found Mimi! I found Mei! Mei-chan, why...? Palmon, you're late. We made a date to meet here 'cause they wanted to eat french fries. Costume's perfect, no? I'm a edo-girl! Fries! Fries! Mei-chan, don't act spoiled! What are you drawing? Costumes for the cafe. There's no budget, so we have to make them ourselves. Are they worms? It's the cafe outfit! I'm sorry! Mei! It'll be okay. The early bird sits on the worm. Sits on? You want to make something like what we just looked at, right? Yeah. Something like... ...this? Whoa! A genius in our midst! Yes, that's it, exactly it! You're incredible, Meimei. Thanks! Hug me too! Me too! What's going on? From Koshiro-kun. The Infected Digimon has appeared! What should we do? It seems they appeared close by. Let's go, Palmon! Okay. Yes... Mei-chan... We're going too, right? Hurry up, you two! I saw the email! I'm on my way! I leave it to you guys. Agumon is waiting in the server. Find a nearby monitor you can use. Taichi-san, Mimi-san and Meiko-san are on their way. Koshiro Witnesses reported a mysterious space in the sky, like a distortion, out of which appeared unidentified creatures. Access to the area has been restricted. Awful, those unrecognizable things again. What are they? This is scary. Mimi. It's okay. What was that? Let's go see! Orgemon? It's infected! Mimi, watch out! Mei-chan! Come this way! Mei! Mei-chan. Mei. Mei-chan, thanks. - Thanks. - Thanks. Koshiro-kun. It's Orgemon! I saw from here. Taichi and the others will be there soon, so just hold tight. What? Hold tight?! Leave it to me. What? Mimi-san? Later now. Mimi, you plan to fight Orgemon? No, just push it back into the distortion. Even infected, it's still Orgemon, right? Right! But he told us to hold tight... It'll be fine. And the live broadcast means lots of people are watching. We'll make it perfectly clear there are good Digimons too. Mimi-san! Orgemon! I'm sorry. I promise it won't hurt. Palmon evolution! Togemon! "From: Hikari Yagami" "I'm on my way too." "From: Takeru Takaishi" "Please send the Digimons, Koshiro-san." "From: Koshiro Izumi" "Sub: Joe-san" "Where are you?" Hello? Joe? I just heard from Koshiro. He says everyone's going to Odaiba. Yeah, I heard. I said you were at prep school. But if you're going to go to Odaiba, I'm right behind you! Sorry. I'm busy. "Let's do our best on the next test." "We got to buckle down." As you can see, the two unidentified creatures that appeared in Odaiba... ...are fiercely battling each other. Don't miss anything, cameras! Now, Togemon! Needle Spray! Taichi! Yamato! Wait, you guys came together? Can't make it from here. No. It's completely secured. Togemon! Togemon! Mei-chan! Mei-chan! Leomon? Palmon! Stay strong, Palmon! Mei-chan... I'm sorry... It wasn't you guys. That helicopter got too close. It's not Meimei's fault. I said to do it. Didn't I tell you to hold tight? I'm sick of Palmon and the others being criticized. Aren't you too? Yes, but... So you acted out of good intentions. Now look at the result. It's a very serious and delicate problem. Mimi-san, you have... ...a very egocentric side. Mimi... That was uncalled for. I'm going home. Mimi-chan! Mimi-san! No, wait! Leave her alone for a while. What happened to Joe? I texted him. I couldn't get him on the phone. All this going on, and still studying is more important? Lay off. No question, Joe might be very logical and overly cautious about everything, but he also used to know what's important and what we should do. And yet... I said, lay off. I'm sure Joe knew he should have come. Even so he must have been unable to. I know that. Hey Joe, sure we don't have to go? I hear everyone else is there. I know what would happen if I went. I'd be berated for not going. Then someone would take my side. And I'd be left unable... ...to say anything. As you can see, we were attacked by the unidentified creatures, crashing our helicopter. Mimi? What a mess. Apparently this calamity has closed Joe's school as well. How is Joe these days? Well, despite all his studying... I see. I want him to try his best. Th... Thank you very much. I think you guys did great, Meiko. Yeah! And without any help! Please come in. Taichi? Leomon? Why? He said he has something to tell us. There are mutations occurring in the Digital World. I came to tell you about them. We first realized it when Orgemon started acting strange. The cause is unknown. But apparently there are the Digimons acting the same strange way. Yes. We call them "Infected Digimons." ls one of those mutations the distortions in space, that's connecting the Digital World and our world? Indeed. It is how I came here. I had my eye on Orgemon to keep him in check but I was too late. You don't seem infected. Why? I don't know. I remember, though, that when Orgemon was infected, it was like something within him became deranged. May I ask you something? Which came first in the Digital World, the distortions or... ...the Infected Digimons? First came the infection. I thought the distortions caused it all, but could the opposite perhaps be true? There could be something else causing the infection. For example, data or some program. Or some kind of creature. If the distortions too were a phenomenon born from infection, it would add up. What a scary conversation. What if we get infected too? Should we put on bug repellent? Will it really work? What about sun block? Maybe we should put on surgical masks. Roger, senpai. Don't worry. You're safe as long as you're in the server in this room. It's kept as a stand alone ordinarily. But when connecting to the outside, it has a robust anti-intruder system of my own design with threefold security. And you need my personal authentication. If the infection has an origin... Ring any bells? Hey, I heard that girl was on TV. No way. You mean... The news about the helicopter in Odaiba? I saw it too! Say it to my face. Are you alright? That was really loud. I'm okay. Careful! There're all kinds of dangerous things like needles and scissors. Yeah... I pricked myself everywhere while I was basting. Good thing I came to help you. Where's Mimi-chan? Tachikawa-san, have a minute? It's about this. There's no way we'll do it. Wear this kind of outfit to serve guests. You never asked, just told us what to wear. We won't stand for it. You're Jikochu. "Jikochu"? You don't know? It means self-centered and annoying! It's done! It's so lovely! If you want kimono scraps, there are tons in the back. Use whatever you want. Thank you. Mimi-san. How was the meeting? Mimi-san! Sora-san put the outfits together so beautifully! If it's like this, I might even... Sorry, we decided not to wear them. I shouldn't have worked on the design. Um... did something happen? Not especially. But we already made... I'm telling you to forget them! I'm sorry. - Mimi-san! - Mimi-chan! Joe senpai... Are you skipping prep school? Is that okay, even with your exams? What about you? Aren't you busy preparing for the school festival? Mimi-san and... Joe senpai? Am I Jikochu? Well... You don't refute it. Sorry. It's fine. I did know on some level. These past couple days I was made painfully aware. When something feels right or I think something is good, I act like it's good for everyone else too. But ultimately... I'm not seeing those around me. It ends up making them feel bad. I hurt Palmon too. I even lost my temper with Meimei. I'm sick of myself. If you're doing something, Jikochu is still better. I'm disgusted with myself. I'm a worthless coward. Joe senpai... Why is it us, again, that has to take care of things? Because we're the DigiDestined? Why is that destiny ours? You still have that question, even now? I know. I was over it. But even though you get over it once, the same questions return. How long must we be the DigiDestined? There's so much I have to do at this point in my life. In order to join society, to become an adult. I have to choose my own way to adulthood, not to the DigiDestined. That's why I've been studying. And so you're skipping prep school? You got me there. I'm off to prep school. Joe senpai. It's better to be Jikochu... ...than a coward. Saying that you have to be an adult? You coward! I saw you in a new light. What now? Because of Joe-san. Not that he didn't come, you said he was "unable" to. Joe-san might be seeking a solution. Taichi, why not talk to Joe-san? Leave it be. Taichi... There are some things he doesn't want to face now. Doesn't want to face? Like that he's one of the DigiDestined? If I talk to him, then he might have to face that. - You too? - What? There's something you don't want to face? Is that why you can't talk to Yamato-san? Just go to sleep already. Joe? You want something? Here you go, your midnight snack! I put an egg in it! You're always so kind. There's so little I can do. I'm here whenever you need me, whatever I can do to... Gomamon! I'm sorry. Joe, don't let your ramen get cold! Gomamon...? "From: Gomamon" "Thanks for everything." Is that so? Well then, Gomamon should live here a while. Huh? It's really okay? When Koshiro hears the situation, he's sure to say the same thing. There are more meetings here recently, so if you assist preparing snacks and tea, it would be a real help. I'll do it! Hey, I'm here! What are you so worked up about, Koshiro? There's something urgent I need to investigate. What is it? An email. It came to my address last night, sender unknown. I thought it might be spam, but it was clean of viruses. When I checked... DigiCode! How come? Somehow, it's the same text as in the traces of the Digital World. Could it be some prank? Possibly. But there's no harm in checking. And even if it is a prank, we need to ascertain who sent it and why. Yes. The Digimon in question is under control through its partner. Nonetheless, someone might try to take advantage of the opportunity. We must continue to be vigilant. Okay. Himekawa-san. Here's the latest data from the research lab on predicted locations of distortion. It shows that... ...we need to increase our security level in this area beginning tomorrow. I see. Request headquarters to increase security. Especially in crowded areas. In fact... ...unfortunately, tomorrow is the school festival. "10th GEKKO FESTIVAL" Security personnel have been increased. They have permission to evacuate the school in an emergency. What about those kids? How could I tell them? I want them to have fun today. Before the Digimon partners, they're first kids. "CLOSED" Mimi-san! You came! Meimei! Your outfit! Well since we already made it. That's no reason to... Just... I wanted to wear it! Since we went to dress stores and worked on the design together... I mean, the design was really yours! Finding fabric, sewing it... it was Sora-san at the sewing machine. As you said, I felt "happy"! I thought about your cafe making everyone happy... ...would be possible in this outfit. So... Meimei! Thank you! M... Mimi-san! I was right. You look so cute! I shouldn't have said I wouldn't wear it. About that... We're here! I know we'd be the only ones. M... maybe we should... Yes! We dress as we please. People can say what they want. "Those who desire true power must know the darkness, and go beyond." "Go beyond the darkness"? What on earth could it mean? Yummy! Palmon, are your wounds okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. You did really great. Try this too. Much obliged! And this too. Much obliged! Senpai, you're a marvel! Mei-chan was amazing too! Yeah! You really went at Orgemon. I hear you did great. Stunning! Yeah! What awesome courage. Thank you, guys- "From: Joe Kido" "ls Gomamon with any of you?" Gomamon? Yes? It's Joe senpai, asking if you're here. Joe? You came without telling him? N-yeah- Okay, I'll let him know you're here. Don't tell him! Joe senpai will worry. Please. But... Just let it be, Koshiro. Gomamon has a lot going on himself. Can we let him have his way for now? Okay. Is it really okay? ...yeah. "From: Hikari Yagami" "Gomamon's not here. Is everything okay?" "From: Yamato Ishida" "Not here. What happened?" "From: Koshiro Izumi" "Not here. But I'm sure Gomamon's okay." Where the heck is he? I... I can't. I can't do it! What are you saying? You want to make everyone happy, right? Opening time! Good morning! C'mon, you say it too! Good ahchoo! What a cool greeting! I said, I can't do it! You'll be fine! Good morning! Want some yakisoba? I'm fine. They have crepes too. I don't want any. I wrote the sign by the school gate. Why should I care? I just can't take the atmosphere of school festivals. You said the same in high school. Even though you loved lively events like festivals in elementary school. We can't always stay children. That's what I learned. I thought so much. But no matter how much I thought, I had no answer. I really struggled. That was high school. You mean you were struggling to grow up? But there was nothing childish about you. Ken Ichijouji? Something wrong? It's nothing. Here you are! Hi, is there room for us? Hello! Table for two! I... I'll lead you to y... your seats. I... I'm sorry! But her bashful style is actually getting her lots of fans! 3-“ Stop it! Where's Meicoomon? At Koshiro's office with the other Digimons. I see. Just the Digimons there? Koshiro-san is there too. Izumi didn't come either? No, apparently he's researching something. Even though today's the school festival! It's started! - Started? - What has? C'mon Meimei, showtime! I... I can't! I told you, I just can't! No chance! Just give in to it! Got to love those two. . I... I... can't! They're good together. I wish Izumi could see this. "From: Himekawa-san" "Sub: Extremely Urgent" Himekawa-san? "This message has no content" Koshiro, did you get another important email? Uh-oh. Koshiro-kun says he's on his way. Himekawa-san, what did you do? You said it earlier. You want them to be kids rather than the Digimon partners... ...at least today. I simply agreed. But what will Mei-chan and the others do? They'll just stay at Koshiro's office. Maybe I'll go check, just in case? You are an employee here, so you stay here and watch. I'll go have a look. Thank you, ma'am. The school festival is the one at Taichi's school, right? Yamato's band is playing at it too. Sounds fun. I wish we could go. We should go too! But Koshiro isn't even here. Leomon! Take us there! Me? Please! Please! Please! Take us! Take us! Pretty please! Senpai. Take us there! The band is just for the school festival but aren't they cool? What were they called? "WORLD ON THE KNIFE" Oh! Koshiro-kun. Hey! What's with the outfit? I... ls something wrong with it? I guess it's fine. Table for one? For three, please. Takeru-kun. Hikari-chan. May we sit with you? - Absolutely. - Come on in! Table for three! Meimei, show them to their seats. Y... Yes. This way, please. Who's that girl? She's so cute! Mochizuki-san, that outfit really suits you. Wha? I... I'm not... That's... Let me take your picture. So cute! Takeru-kun! What about me, huh? Me! - It's cute on you too! - Too? What do you mean, "too"!? We're here, guys. Just stay still and don't move... So many great smells! I want to go to Mimi's cafe! We must behave. Senpai. I want to go! Attack! Don't go around on your own! Where did they go? What smells! Looks so good! I want to eat! You can't, not without money. Do you have money? No money. Flat broke. And with all this food! Step right up for the Creepy-Cute Costume Contest! The winner can eat anything served at the school festival for free! "For free"? It means you don't need money. That's it! Thank you for a great performance. Please give them another round of applause! Wow, so many people... Now for entry number 20, Gama-chin! I'm Goma, Go-ma-chin! Gomamon? The next entry is the very cute Meicoo-chan! I'm Meicoo! "From: Taichi Yagami" "Gomamon's here! At our school festival!" Yamato, glad I found you. Agumon and the others seem to be here. The Digimons? Seems like they entered the Creepy-Cute Costume Contest. I have a practice game. Do you think you could go check on them? Got it. You still haven't answered. Why Omegamon's fusion was broken up. Isn't it enough that Alphamon was defeated? I don't care when Omegamon broke up, I want to know why. At that time, between us two, within you, there were doubts. Isn't that why? Taichi! Now, after a hard-fought battle, we announce the Creepy-Cute costume that seized the top prize! Hey guys! Is it true that Biyomon's here too? Apparently so. Oh no! And the winner is... Meicoo-chan! What about Gabumon? Meicoo-chan, congratulations! I'm so happy! How cute! Unbelievable! I told you to keep sleeping! But it seemed like such fun. Congratulations! Mei-chan. You said it! Mei-chan! I want to eat yakisoba. Right! It's free if we're with Meicoomon, isn't it? Hey, you guys. People think you're kids in animal costumes, so act a bit more unnatural. Instead of natural? Don't confuse us. Gomamon! Joe. Why did you leave all of a sudden? Did something make you unhappy? It's not that. Then what? You can't have left for no reason. Just leave me alone. That's what you were saying to me, wasn't it? To leave you alone. That made you angry. I'm not angry. Then what? If you have something to say, spit it out! You're the one holding something in! What? You can't say you don't want to fight together anymore, can you? I'm a hindrance to you. It is a hindrance, yes. I knew it. But not you! Why do we have to fight again? Why is it always us? Because you're the DigiDestined, right? But why are we? Why me!? If there's fighting to be done, people who want to fight should do it! It's not like I want to fight. Nor do I. There are so many things I have to do! That's why it's better for me to keep away from you. If I'm with you, then you have to fight. That's what you think, isn't it? I won't run away. So you think I'm running away? Do whatever you want. Don't worry, I'll leave you alone. I'll leave you... Mei. Hey! Mei-chan, you can't talk. I want to eat flan! We should have gone with Agumon and the others. Sorry. Hang on a second. Flan! Meimei! Showtime! I can't dance any more! I'm sorry! Flan! Waaah! Ah, well. Give me a flan! Mei, you're being mean! Mei's so mean. I did it! Nice goal, Taichi! Joe senpai? Joe senpai! Where's Gomamon? I'm going home. I have to study. Why me? Why? Someone give me a reason that makes sense! Wait here. I'll get you a crepe or something. You said it! Meicoomon is gone? Mei-chan... "From: Koshiro Izumi" "New distortion appeared." Thank you very much! What's wrong? A distortion appeared. Behind the school. Oh no! It's my fault. I let my guard down. I made a mistake leaving Meicoomon's side. Meicoomon? Mei! Mei-chan! Ichijouji-kun!? Let Meicoomon go! Leomon! What's wrong, Leomon? Mei! Mei-chan! Meimei! Mei-chan! Mei-chan! Mei-chan! Mei-chan! Mei! What should we do? Meicoomon! Palmon! I made it in. Mimi, I'll go. Palmon, Wait! I want to save Meicoomon. You feel the same, right? It'll be fine this time. Palmon! I'm going too. - Gomamon! - Gomamon! - Leomon! - Don't worry. Leave it to me. Mimi! Mochizuki-san! Guys! Meicoomon's been taken by Ichijouji-kun! Him again...? Why? - It's...! - Imperialdramon! Something is wrong. Let's go too! But Gomamon and Palmon went through! Why can't we? The distortion's shut tight. Some extraordinary force might be shutting out penetration from the outside. The distortion! The distortion vanished. We have to go it alone. Okay! What the heck is happening, Koshiro? Please wait. I'm trying to monitor what's happening inside. Here we go. Leomon! Hang on Meicoomon! I promise I'll save you... Leomon! - It happened again! - Again? The same thing happened just now. Could Leomon be infected? Palmon! Palmon evolution! Togemon! Needle Spray! Togemon can't do it alone! Damn! Can't we plunge in there somehow? Is there no way to go through this computer? How about it, Koshiro? I'm afraid not. Gomamon. C'mon Gomamon, you can do it! It's too much for Gomamon. Gomamon has to evolve. How embarrassing. Togemon! Drat! Why does this have to happen? Joe senpai. It's Gomamon. Gomamon is fighting. Joe senpai, you said you wanted a reason, right? A reason for what? For fighting? Or a reason why we're the DigiDestined? Joe senpai, you've forgotten something important. You and Gomamon were chosen together as partners. Do you need a reason for that? Who cares about being an adult or a child? You two are partners. Joe... Gomamon. I think I'm done for. Run, Gomamon! Gomamon! Gomamon! Gomamon! Joe! I'm here now. I was waiting. Go, Gomamon! Here I go. Go, Gomamon! Gomamon evolution! Ikkakumon! Harpoon Vulcan! Ikkakumon super evolution! Zudomon! Hammer Spark! Zudomon ultimate evolution! Vikemon! Arctic Blizzard! What's that one? I never saw that evolution before. Joe senpai. I didn't need a reason. Yet I made Gomamon wait forever and kept putting him off. Jikochu, I guess? I think you're fine that way too, Mimi-kun. - Togemon! - Mimi? Give it all you've got! Togemon super evolution! Lilymon! Flow' Cannon! Not done yet! Lilymon ultimate evolution! Rosemon! Forbidden Temptation! Now! They did it! Here I come, Meicoomon! Mei-chan! Mimi! Joe! Ichijouji. Why did he appear? And Imperialdramon too? Pukamon, you were amazing. Thanks. You both went into ultimate evolution. What would cause that to happen? Wait, could it be...? "Know the darkness, and go beyond." Could it be a prophecy of ultimate evolution? Huh? Is there something on my face? It's nothing. What's wrong, Meicoomon? Everything's okay now. Chin up! C'mon, there's nothing to be afraid of. Leomon! What's happening? What can be wrong. It's... fine now... Noooooo! Mei-chan! Wait, Meicoomon! What in the world? What was that? What the heck just happened? Mei-chan! You're fine with just leaving things as they are now? The distortion has closed and we can do no more. We must consider our next course of action. Why in the world did this happen? The distortions began and the Infected Digimons appeared for the same reason.
