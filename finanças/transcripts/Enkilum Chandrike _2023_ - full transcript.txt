Tell me. Hello. Aargh! Grandma! Yes. Tell me. When? I...I will come now. Mom! Something urgent came up! - I'll be right back! - Have some food and go! Why are you in such a hurry? Deviyechi! Hey Abhi! Where is Paviyettan? He left in the morning itself, to meet a prospective bride. - So early in the morning? - Yes. - He left even before I woke up. - Is it? He believes that nothing good will happen if he sees my face! He is crazy! Where is it happening? I don't know. Will he tell me that? Anyway, it's not in this town. Why so? There are no more prospective brides to meet in this town, right? Oh my Deviyechi! He didn't take the phone. Shucks! Where will I go find him now? He goes missing right when something urgent comes up! If you call him for something urgent, Pavithran will reach immediately! People have only good things to say about 'Society Pavithran'. - Yes. - He is an all rounder, right? The entire town has a high opinion of him. I know all that. Is there anyone who doesn't know 'Society Pavithran'? Everyone knows it. But I just mentioned it. I had two love affairs earlier. The townsfolk had a high opinion of them too. But since they didn't have an upper caste surname as a tail, my dad didn't have such a great opinion about them. It's not like what he's claiming. I measure the milk at the dairy co-operative society. That's how I got the name. I'm somewhat of a socialist. So, I've never really cared about these upper-caste surnames! Love is more important than all that, right? Why aren't you saying anything, Sujina? I have to tell you something, Pavithretta. Oh! Not 'Pavithrettan'. ' Paviyettan' Call me that. That can wait. I need to call you that only if this works out, right? Whatever be the case, you can call me that. Even if it is to say that you don't like me, you can say, 'Paviyetta, I don't like you'. Anyway, I know you're going to say that. I'm not insulting you. You know that my dad brought this alliance... because of the issue in my horoscope, right? But if I leave this house now, another person will be in trouble. So, I don't want this marriage. What is it? If you have any problem, you can tell me. Whatever help you need, this Paviyettan will do it. The help you need right now, is to break this alliance. Right? Why not! I'm quite used to all this. Chandretta, she is actively looking for a job. If you give her some time for that... Did we ask you anything? Go inside! Listen, Chandran. If we keep listening to whatever they say, their voices will become louder. They will climb on top of our heads. But times have changed, right Ravi? Does that mean that we should let the kids do as they please? I'm not such an old-fashioned person. If that was the case, I'd have asked you to stand outside and talk. Right? - Isn't it? - That's true. Yes, yes. Here you go. Call me if you need anything. It's alright. I'll make up some reason to tell your Dad. Okay then. - Hey! - Yes. Please don't be upset with me. Not at all. Spread love! I learned it from the boys. "O' girl, like the deep dark clouds" "O' deer, with a smile on your face" "The rhythm of my heart has faltered, o' black-eyed beauty" "When you narrate a story with your swan-like eyes" "our boy whose mouth is wide open, becomes happy" 'Kooman Thonda' 'Sumalatha Arts & Sports Club' - Yes? - Hey! You woke up so early? - I haven't slept. - Why? Why are you here so early? I need to tell you something. Stop, stop! Where are you going, Anikutta? - It's the wedding invitation. - Wedding? Wow! Is it your elder brother's wedding? No! It's my wedding! - Your wedding? - Yes. Be there on the previous day itself! If not, please come for the wedding at least. - For Deviyechi? - No need. I'll give it. Okay then. - Komala Chechi! - Yes. - Did you see Paviyettan? - No. 'Komala Tailors' "The jingle of your glass bangles and the tinkling of your anklets" "You snatched me away with your kohl-lined eyes, my dear" "Your lips, as red as rose apple" "And your cherry cheeks" Stop, stop! Hey, stop! Stop, I say! - Why have we stopped here? - Toddy for me, breakfast and sad song for you! Come on! "Even if you have all this or not" "I love you, girl" "Even if I can't give you a tree full of cash" "I can give you my heart, my dear" "I shall tie the nuptial chain right below your neck, my dear" "I shall keep waiting for you to say yes" "If you give me a glance," "I shall fix the wedding on the fourth day" Nisha! Did someone come to see you today? - To see me? No. - No? What do you want? No, Chetta. I didn't mean that. I came searching for someone. It's from the morning batch. Chetta! One buttermilk Sarbath! He drops by when he visits Bibeesh's house or Avarangattu, normally. It's not that. He went to meet some prospective bride somewhere. Why are you angry about that? I hope at least this one happens! Let at least one guy from your gang, have a good life. I don't see any chance for that though. Anyway, my aunt will have something to laugh about. Marriage is not something that's completely in our control, right? We'll see. We can also make it happen ourselves. Girls of this age will have many desires and thoughts. If you keep heeding to them, you will be doomed. Are you the one who's saying this, Chandretta? I joined the club, being inspired by people like you. You were such an awesome person back then. You threw that 'Yuvajanatha' board away, and fixed the 'Sumalatha' board. Don't you remember that? - I do remember. - Oh, you do? And the same man is talking all this regressive nonsense now? Those times have passed, Pavi. You need to take care of yourself. This isolation... is not a joke! I'm not saying that your boys are too bad. When they're old and mature enough, they will go their own way, wiping the dust off their bums. You won't have anyone else, other than you! Let them go, Chandretta. But when they need something, they will come to me, right? Will they be there for you when you need something? If I start thinking like that, what kind of man would that make me? Oh! "What a virtuous world!" - So that's what you yearn for! - Not like that. No need to cough. It didn't work out. Now you can tell everyone in the village. Why are you getting angry at me? Are you really my aunt? Why do you have that doubt? 16 years have passed since your mother died. Have I brought any harm to you so far? What you're doing now is not harmful? Haven't I taken care of you? - Haven't I taken care of you? - You can continue doing that, right? How much longer! I'll die only after you die! Hey! According to your horoscope, if you don't get married now, it will happen only after you turn 45. Let's sit and watch each other's faces till then. Well, even if you don't pray for my marriage to happen, please don't pray that it should get cancelled. Oh my God! What am I hearing? What is this guy saying? Say it and go! Why did you cough earlier? Can't I cough? Can't I? You coughed to mock me, right? You and your... Hey! Deviyechi... Paviyettan has reached, right? - Yes, he did. - Has the wedding been fixed? No chance, man! Don't make the scene dark! Dark? What dark? Tell that to him! Dark, it seems! Hey Paviyetta! When did you come? I came earlier, and I've come now too. - What is it? - Has your wedding been fixed? Wedding, it seems! - Tell me. - Come with me. I'll tell you. Tell me and go, dude! Did you know? Our Bibeesh Balan's wedding has been fixed! Is it? When? - I think it was yesterday. - Shucks! It's a good news, right? Why do you have a problem with it? How can he do this when the two of us are still unmarried? Forget that. We are members of the club and we didn't know about it! Did you know about it? - That's true. - Yes. - Where are the others? - At the club. What about our director? - Kiran? - Yes. He must be giving an interview to some TV channel now. Kiran Babu Nelliyath. A huge star cast. A movie which tasted both box office success and critical acclaim, after a long time. This is a dream start, right? Saneesh? Yes. Saneesh, I still have doubts regarding how dreams should be defined. I've dreamed alone and also along with others. Some of those people are still with me. Some of them have left. But when they leave, they don't take their dreams with them. Let's start with dreams, that you just spoke about. I'll read out the Facebook post written by Mr. Mohanlal, after watching your movie. Happened to watch 'Pallimaniyum Pemariyum' directed by Mr. Kiran Babu Nelliyath. I really don't have words. All I have to say is... 'Dum dum dum, Dundubhi nadam, Nadam nadam' Huh? Dum dum dum, Dundubhi nadam, - Naadam, naadam. - Saneesh! Some technical issues. - Hey fool! Wake up and come outside! Saneesh? First, you make a movie. Think of giving interviews after that. Something came up. Wake up and come. Don't you want to sleep, buddy? It's almost noon, dude. Wake up and come. I'm outside. What is it? 'Chameleon' Bibeesh's wedding has been fixed! Who? Our Bibeesh? Without letting us know? Get up and come outside! - Wait. I'm coming. You chameleon! Come quickly, buddy! I've been waiting for so long! It's the same dream everyday, right? In that case, can't you realize that it's a dream when it starts? - There's a movie called 'Inception'. - Oh, there he goes again! In it, DiCaprio spins a top to find out whether he's in a dream or not. If the top continues to spin, it's a dream. If the top stops spinning, it's reality. - I have to try that next time. - Let that be. Get on the bike. We need to settle this issue. Yes! Bibeesh! Bloody dog! Start the bike! Let's go to the club. Scene Club. Go! 'Koomanthonda Diaries' 'Do(nâ€™t) discuss politics in the club' There is no need for so much discussion! His wedding has been fixed. And he didn't tell us! Sumalatha club is informed even about weddings from neighbouring towns. The moment they are fixed! Isn't that so? And this is one of our own! Well, we need to find out what's so secretive in it that he didn't even inform us! We will go and ask him directly. What if he doesn't answer? We will grab him by the collar! - Be realistic! - Why? Will he say it the moment we grab him by the collar? He is a tough nut to crack! Oh! Please don't be so negative, Amal! Well, forget him not informing us. He could have told Paviyettan at least, right? - He could have! - Yes! Don't you have any role in this? Why didn't he tell you? Well, not informing me was a mistake indeed. Yes. But they should be doing this out of their own will, right? - But he wasn't willing to do it. - And it's his family matter. We should consider that as well, right? My dear Paviyetta! Guys, shouldn't we find out the name of his fiancee? Yes, I would like to know. Stop taking rest then. Let's go and ask. - Okay. - Paviyetta! No, you guys carry on. I've got some work. I'm very busy. Paviyetta, how can we go without you? - We will go and come back quickly. - Yes. - Hello. - Isn't this Paviyettan? - Yes. - This is Sujina. - Yes, tell me. - Are you busy? Not at all! Well, is it possible for me to meet you? Yes, we can meet. In that case, can you come near the bridge? Okay. I will come. Okay then. Hey, you guys carry on. I've got some work. Okay? Don't come if you don't want to. - We will ask him. - Yes. Without informing the boys of Sumalatha club no one should get married here! - Come on, guys! - Yes! Can't we take the bike inside? If Mamma turns violent, we will have to run, carrying the bike. It's safe outside. Don't kick open the gate to show heroism! The gate doesn't have the middle portion! No one saw it! Come on! Hi Mamma! We're not sending him out to play games! Okay. Hey! Mamma! Do it softly. Hey! Is he upstairs? He is upstairs. Go on. Well, don't tell him that I told you. It's a secret. We won't betray you! Good for you! This will rock! Kiran, no! It's Sachin! Kiran, why does Babeesh hate Bibeesh so much? Is there any house where the younger brother doesn't cause trouble to the elder one? None, as far as I know! Mumma, I'll come and have food! Wait! We'll feed you! Mumma! Please give me some privacy, Mumma! Knock hard! Mumma, didn't I tell you that I'm coming? I'll call you back, Vava (baby). Vava? It was my friend. Va... Va (come). No, no! I wasn't asking you to come. Vava Suresh. A snake entered my Uncle's house. A nice, small rat snake! That's what. Why are you guys here? Any tournament coming up? We came to catch a python. Oh! Is it? Which... python? Where? Are you joking? Oh my God! When a girl dumped you the other day, you cried shamelessly, resting on this shoulder! You drank the last drink I poured for myself and... puked on my shirt itself! Yes! You shouldn't have done this to us! Of course! You didn't tell the two of us. Forget that. You should have told Abhiyettan and Paviyettan at least. You should respect their age after all! Correct. Why are you talking as if you came to know about something? We came to know! And we've come to know more! Babeesh! Bloody dog! Hey, hey! Look here! Look here. Look at our faces and talk! - I have to say it, right? - Yes! It is said that you're not supposed to delay what you're about to say. Tell me, Suji. I can help you with anything you need. You could have told me when I came home, right? I really wanted to tell you then. But then I had a doubt whether to say it or not. Later, I made up my mind. Paviyetta... Tell me. Can you foil a wedding? Whose? For what? My younger sister's wedding. Your own younger sister's? Will I ask you to foil it if it wasn't my own sister? Well... I don't understand. She has been in love with someone for a while now. But a few days back, we received a marriage proposal. Dad has almost fixed it. Each time I foil the proposals that come for me, she's the one who feels relieved. Foiling a wedding is a bad thing, right? What men of the house do by claiming to be the decision-makers... That's also bad, right? Isn't it? That's true. But my theory is that we shouldn't do anything that goes against society's rules. Which society? Your dairy society? Not the dairy society. Our... our society... which we are all a part of. Isn't it bad to do this there? Aren't my sister, her lover and myself not part of it? - You are. - Aren't you a part of it? I am. I'll still be a part of it even if I foil this wedding, right? Well, don't you have any desire to marry me? Well, that... To marry whom? Do you wish to marry me or not? Well... You don't have to say this just to make me foil the wedding. Even otherwise, if you ask for my help, I will do it. Love doesn't have just one meaning, right? There is only one meaning for what I have for you right now. But... for that to happen, I need to find a solution in her case. I need to unite her with her lover. Are you serious? If you keep getting older, you'll lose out on the time you could romance! So, find a way. Forget everything else. I haven't gotten the opportunity to sing a duet yet. Suji, can you please join me? You must have learned this from the boys, right? Yes, yes. - Hey Pavi! - We've run out of coconut oil. - If you want Pappadams for lunch, get coconut oil quickly. Okay. People are coming. I'm leaving. Okay then. Who is standing over there? I don't know. Walk quickly. Suji! What is your younger sister's name? We won't let you go unless you tell us, Bibeesh. Actually, you never know where trouble would come from, right? That's why I kept it a secret. There's something fishy, Abhiyetta. Or else, he won't do all this. What's fishy? Well... actually, she and I were planning to tell you together. - Doesn't she have a name? - She does. Then, say it! You guys know her. Chandrika. Who...? The daughter of Raviyettan, who runs a hotel in Eyyanadu? She's the one! Chandrika Ravindran! Happy now? Abhiyetta! 'Abhi + Chandrika' "Plenty of twisted brains who've fallen in all sorts of troubles" "They're wrecking their brains, trying to pursue you" "O' sweet, beautiful girl sitting atop the mango tree on the opposite shore?" "Won't you even acknowledge your lover standing on this shore?" "But why, Chandrika?" "But why, Chandrika?" "But why, Chandrika?" "But why, Chandrika?" You should eat all of it, Blacky. What? - What is it? - What? You've come back like the dog that went to the market! Where's the coconut oil? Here you go! Should I sing it aloud while walking then? Even if you want to, you can't sing, right? There is something in your mind, huh? Yes. People have all sorts of problems! All of them can't be shared! Tell me the truth. Did those boys beat you up? I've found a way to lock you. Anyway, it's not about your marriage, right? What if it is? What if it is? You will find a wife only when pigs fly! Don't get me talking! No wonder Uncle fled this town long ago! He had great foresight! Poor man! Your Dad wouldn't have had it at all then! I have lost! Are you satisfied? That's better. You lose all the time, right? You got the coconut oil, right? Fry the Pappadam! I'm hungry. I forgot to say that. We've run out of Pappadams too. Abhiyetta! Wake up! Short term memory loss! Say something, Abhiyetta. Speak up! Abhiyetta. I'll brief you about the whole thing. Okay? The girl whom you were after for 13 years... This guy snatched her away in 13 seconds. As you heard it, you collapsed like a jackfruit falling from its tree! We were waiting to see whether you'll wake up or not. Got it? Got it? He is conscious. He's crying! I think all his memories are in the attic! In my attic? My dear people, the music concert by SR Orchestra will be beginning soon. Before that... What was it before that? Balloon, balloon. The prize distribution for the winners of... the Balloon bursting competition, that happened earlier today. First prize... - Who got the first prize? - Chandrika Ravindran. Chandrika Ravindran! "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" Oh! Dream within a dream! Carry on! "Should I get rid of your tears?" "Should I show you the full moon?" "Should I get rid of your tears?" "Should I show you the full moon?" "Should I share my golden dreams with you, forever?" "Should I share them?" "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" "And promise to come home as my wife?" Abhiyetta! Abhiyetta! Abhiyetta! He has carrying her around for years on his palm... I mean, forearm! And Bibeesh... you... Is that so? And has he told this to her till date? And now when she said that she likes me... Isn't this envy? Why didn't you tell her, Abhiyetta? The send-off day of 10th grade. She was in 5-B then. She wrote for the first time on the last page. Even if you study for M.A., or B.A., don't forget "M.E."! Sheesh! What a lousy flashback! No, Amal! Let Abhiyettan open his heart. Continue. And below that, she wrote... Forever yours, Abhiyetta! Phew! Romantic! And then? For 13 long years, we never spoke to each other. I loved her silently. Thinking that she still has the same old love for me in each smile of hers, I waited for the right time. My love! No other dog in this town knows about it, except you guys! I haven't even told this to my Paviyettan. Forget him! Even she doesn't know it! I feel that it's really late now. Great! But how come this wedding was fixed out of a sudden? I'll tell you why. When I called her one day, her voice sounded like Morgan Freeman. Who was it? Her Dad! So, her folks found out about us. When they asked her, she said that she marry only me. Sweet girl! She loved me ever since she was in college, apparently. I'm getting goosebumps when I think about it. Where? Here. It's there. Mother promise! - Bibeesh. - Yes. What's your decision? A sacrifice for Abhiyettan...? No, never! This is the first time that a girl said that she loves me! I'll rock it! You guys get going! Mumma has made lunch only for me. Abhiyetta, forgive me if you can. Spread love! It's not love. He is spreading hate! - Dog! - Mumma! Console him. Abhiyetta, everything will be alright. Just think that it was not meant for you! You...! Why, Chandrika? Why did you do this to me? If you are so sad, shall we foil this wedding? Foiling a wedding is a risky job. But it's profitable too. It's not about the risk. But.. if someone finds out, my reputation will be damaged, right? It's pointless to think about losing your reputation! Take a decision and go forward with it! Or else, you'll end up being like me. I know very well that there's no one better than you, to help, foil or harm someone. - But... - What's your problem then? Won't it be a shame if the boys come to know? Hey, what you're doing without their knowledge... is for getting boys of your own in the future, right? Those boys will forgive you! But... the boys won't get involved in such activities. That's why. Chandrika Ravindran will turn into a closed chapter. We will make that happen! Will you get me beaten up by my own townsfolk? You keep quiet, Abhiyetta. He keeps doing this. It's not like pure, divine love. If she goes with him out of excitement, her life will be doomed. I've heard this exact dialogue from all the losers who foil marriages! What? We will tear them apart, without harming either the rose or the thorn. It'll be a disgrace if we get caught, Kiran. Both cheating and betrayal will be involved. We won't be able face our families or the townsfolk. Forget that. What do we tell Paviyettan? You shouldn't tell them! We will foil this wedding without letting anyone know. I'll come tomorrow. What is that guy's name? Isn't it wrong to spread lies about someone else? But you're not saying it. I am, right? What is the guy's name? She said she'll send me his name and photo. I hope it's someone we're not acquainted with. Whoever it is, we'll be saying the same thing to them, right? Drinking, smoking weed, love affairs! That's true. It's a message from her. This is not possible, Chandretta! This is Bibeesh! He is very close to me. How can I foil his wedding? Yes. This is Balan's son, right? No, Chandretta. We will foil this. Since I know everything about him, won't it be wrong if I don't foil it? Well done! You have started thinking for yourself, at least now. - Hey Chandretta! - Devi. Can't you stop him from fooling around with those boys? You're not liking the peace of mind I get from it? I tell him all the time, Devi. Even when he is with those boys, when he joins them in their buffoonery, he feels alive during those moments. That's also necessary, right? But he should have some sense of responsibility, right? I don't understand what you're saying! He will quit all that. Everyone's problems will be solved. Well, Chandretta... Once I am sorted, we should get Aunty married and send her away. That's what I think. Get lost! Even if I get married, I won't leave this house and go anywhere! Oh! So you do wish to get married again? Yes, I want to! So what? Go and find me a good alliance, Chandretta. You're mocking me? Get lost! Poor thing, right? Yes, she is. At times, I feel like pampering her. At times, I feel like banging her against the wall. Hey! So we will foil it, right? For the time being, Paviyettan needn't know about this. He won't support all this. No one else will know about it either. Tell us your plan. I'm going to use all my creativity to write a script, Abhiyetta. An awesome script in which all of us would give rocking performances, and at the end of which you will get Chandrika! Script? And that too, an awesome one from you? - Yeah, right! - Amal! You continue, my dear. Say it clearly. Amal, by tomorrow morning... Some pens, lots of paper and a bucket full of black tea. All these should be ready at the club. - For what? - For what? Don't be in a hurry, dear! Just wait and see! Huh? "Plenty of twisted brains who've fallen in all sorts of troubles" "They're wrecking their brains, trying to pursue you" "O' sweet, beautiful girl sitting atop the mango tree on the opposite shore?" "Won't you even acknowledge your lover standing on this shore?" "You've been in my heart since my school days" "You are the Goddess of this village" "I'm here as a priest to worship and pamper you" "But why, Chandrika?" "My body is aflame with the fire of love" "But why, Chandrika?" "Don't look away from me when I come in front of you" "Struck by the arrow she sends with her pearly eyes" "There's a sweet pain trembling inside" "Holding her hands that have several twinkling bangles" "When will I get to celebrate my honeymoon?" Chandretta, do you have any idea? First, we need to know more details regarding her situation. What should we do for that? Well, we'll find a way! "So much trouble, so much sorrow, so terrifying" "The full moon girl is getting married at sunrise tomorrow" "Get all the weapons you can" "I need to go across the shore and create a furore" "And bring the pretty girl back, holding her hands" Everything is almost ready here. We can conduct both the weddings together, right? "We shouldn't get separated like the lovers in Changampuzha's poem" "Our dreams shouldn't be killed" "But why, Chandrika?" "But why, Chandrika?" Yes! In the climax, Abhiyettan will hold Chandrika's hand and... Wow! Will you film at least this one? Give me the original document. We don't want it here anyway. What a waste of space! Next customer! Sit down. Kiran, just stop showing off and tell us the plan. Using a fraud who handles things very neatly, we will reveal terrifying truths about Bibeesh Balan... to Chandrika's father. That's our first scene. Who else can do that other than us in this town? Who? We will bring someone. To beat a chameleon, we will bring someone who has a chameleon's tongue! A guest role in the beginning itself? Will be believe it if some random guy goes and tells him? What if he is not some random guy? Then who is it? Shambhu! Shambhu Mahadevan! He's quite older than us. But he is an aspiring actor. He had approached me for a chance to act, earlier. If such a senior citizen tells him, Raviyettan will definitely listen to him. Also, he is a brilliant actor! He will rock this scene! Doesn't look like a wedding is going to happen here! Can you go there and enquire? I'll go. But if I do that, it will seem like WE are foiling the wedding. So aren't we the ones who are going to foil it? Yeah, man! Now go and announce it to the whole town! Chandretta, please. There's one way. Acting! Stop it. You rang it once, right? - Chandrettan? - He is also with me. How come both of you are here? Are you on the way to meet some prospective bride? Not at all. I wanted to come here. I just brought him along for company. - Just like that. - Come. What's the matter? Balan must have gone to office, right? Yes. He will be back only by evening. You can come in the evening then. Okay then. Sit, man! Bibeesh is not here, right? - He has gone to the town. - That's good. We have come with a marriage proposal. It's for Bibeesh! Oh! Though he is unemployed, your family is well-off, right? Let him become responsible. Chandretta, I'm happy that you came here to say this. But... we were about to tell all of you. His wedding is almost fixed. Oh! Is it a love marriage? Yes, you can call it that. He said that he had seen a girl. When we went there and enquired, she's from a good family. Moreover, they are from our neighbouring town. Her elder sister is wedding is yet to happen. They have asked us to wait until that's over. That's why we didn't inform anyone. You too shouldn't tell this to anyone. Not at all! Whom are we going to tell? Right? - Yes... to whom? - Well... There's point going that way now! Let's try going this way! A track-back from the hotel board. Kiran. When will your guy come? What will he do? I'll read the script aloud. Without getting noticed by anyone, disappearing in the crowd, and becoming one among them, Shambhu Mahadevan! Back shot! Hey Kiran! Please don't bore us! Come to the point. You say it, dear. After parking the bike in front of Hotel Ravindra, Shambhu looks around and steps inside the hotel. At the cash counter of the hotel, we see Ravi, the owner of the hotel. Her Dad! Shambhu goes and sits at the nearby table, slowly. What if that table is occupied? Without saying anything, he will move to the next table. Idea! Before long, Shambhu orders a strong tea with medium sugar and two banana fritters. The banana fritters in Hotel Ravindra are really bad. Bonda and potato fry. Those are fast moving there. That's correct! Let me finish this! Okay, okay. Hot steaming tea. Shambhu sips it by blowing on it. "Moreover, Gupthan likes to drink hot tea by blowing on it!" You copied that, right? Hey Amal! Let him narrate his entire plan. Please keep quiet for some time. - Okay. Let it be. - Tell us. After having tea and banana fritters, Shambhu walks over to the counter to pay the bill. He takes his wallet out. The tea and banana fritters would cost Rs. 32. He takes out four ten Rupee notes. Along with it, he takes out something else too. A passport size photo of Bibeesh Balan! He hides that photo in between those notes with expert precision. And he hands it over to the owner, Ravi. And after that.... Huh? Isn't this Bibeesh's photo? Do you know Bibeesh? What a question! It's a shame even to admit that I know him! What are you saying? That's not the opinion his townsfolk have about him. The people of his town don't know him well enough. I had enquired with a couple of other people. They have the same opinion too. In his town, he is a gentleman. But he plays all his games outside the town! Just enquire about him in Mangalore. What is it? Tell me the matter! He has been spotted at different hospitals in Mangalore, multiple times. That too, with different girls each time! I don't have to explain the reason for his visits, right? What's the reason? Do I really have to explain the reason? That's it! It's exactly what you guessed! It was God! It was God who brought you here! It was God! Well, don't mention it. Consider it a favour. Rickshaw! How's it? It will work, right? If it's not as boring as your narration, it might work. Don't you think the build-up was a bit too much? For highly talented artists like Shambhu, a minimum build-up is required, my friend. So, what's the plan? Let Shambhu come! "I am a born artist" "Hero in the era of black & white" "Forever I remain as youth" "All the women will fall for this man" "This is my town The people here my kinsmen" "He is the best Man of the macho" "The dialogs he delivers The dance he plays" "Will make sure the audience watch my performance" Why is he like this? It's his debut, right? He must have made it colourful! Is this how he's going to disappear in the crowd? It's not the costume, but the performance that matters! Wait and watch! Waiter! - Ask me. - What? What should I ask? I can say the dialogue only if you ask me, right? Ask me what I need. Is that so? What do you want, Sir? Okay. Two banana fritters and a tea. Two banana fritters and a tea. Two banana fritters and a tea! - Please bless me. - Action! - Well... - Yes? Get me two parottas and Sambar along with it. - Make it fast. - Okay. Is he planning some joint operation with the supplier? Nothing can be predicted. Shambhu Mahadevan is an unpredictable actor. I see! Sheesh! Is this his strategical operation? What's with this new scene that's not part of the script? He must have improvised. Will it flop, Kiran? Just wait! Shambhu Mahadevan won't do anything without a reason! - The situation seems to be okay. - Okay. Shall we go inside and tell him? Don't be in a hurry. When we're going to do something, we should take a good look around. If it flops, my life will be ruined! That will be the end of 'Society Pavithran'. You do something. Go inside and see what's happening there. - Me? - Who else? Go on. Oh no! Paviyettan! Oh no! - Hide, hide! - No. It was just my imagination. He's not here. Run, Chandretta! Run! What is it? What happened? Our boys are inside the hotel. - Is it? - Yes. - What are they doing there? - How do I know? Shucks! This has become a big problem! - How much is it? - 50 Rupees. Okay then. Has she left? She is coming this way! Don't look! - Get me a pack of Horlicks. - Okay. Well, why did Devi come here now? The rotten banana fritters from that shop is her favourite snack! Anyway, she likes you a lot. Why do you say so? Well, she is buying Horlicks for you. Horlicks is not for me. She mixes it in all the milk we get from the cows, and drinks it herself. And I have to add water while giving milk to the society. Let her also drink it, man! She can also drink it, right? Well, if you mix water, won't the reading change? But I'm the one who measures the reading, right? There goes Shambhu. We're not part of this. We just have to sit in the gallery... and watch the game! Hey, did you get the gas agency's phone number? - No. - Okay. I'll give it. Okay. Heard his burp? Natural acting! After eating so much, anyone will burp. It's natural! That's what is called natural acting. Two banana fritters, two parottas and a tea. - 48 Rupees. - Okay. Let the photo be inside. Here you go. Oh no! What? Isn't it correct? It's correct. But... You didn't ask me anything. What should I ask? I can answer only if you ask me who and what, right? What? Well, I don't know him quite well. Even if I do, how can I admit it? What? Whom are you talking about? His name? His name is Sabareesh. Oh no! No. Oh no! Brijesh! Aargh! The one from Kavumchola? Not that one! It was on the tip of my tongue! Bibeesh... Bibeesh! Yes, I got it! Mukesh! Mukesh! - Who is that? - Huh? So, he's no one to you? No! Raviyetta! Coming! - Oh no! I'm doomed! - Who is this Mukesh? Which Mukesh? Take it! Take it! Retake! Retake! Open it and take the photo! Oh no! How dare you come to this town and steal? I wasn't stealing! - He was stealing money! - Don't hit me! I saw it with my own eyes! Hit him! Hit him! Huh? What's going on? - Shambhu! - Sit there! Everything is ruined, right? When you said he's unpredictable, I didn't imagine this! It's done and dusted now, right? - But Shambhu.... - Don't open your mouth! What's happening there? A brawl? Shucks! All our plans are ruined! How do we go there now? How did a fight break out suddenly? Rickshaw! Don't be stressed. Chandrettan has gone to meet your Dad, right? Let him come back. A fight broke out at the hotel today. That's why he couldn't meet him. That guy is creating issues. He wants to do a pre-wedding shoot, it seems. And that too, tomorrow itself. - Pre-wedding? - Yes. That's not going to happen. Who is he to decide all that? Well, if you create any issue now, your dad will come to know about this. And then, he will become even more adamant, and get you married today itself, right? So? Are you saying that I should agree to do it? - That's not what I meant. - Then? Just agree to do it. Let him take the photos. But not one photo will come out. I'll take care of that. Okay? Pavi! What happened, Chandretta? Nothing is possible. He said he's going to bring the wedding date forward. It will happen within the next two months. Paviyetta... Now what? Well, don't worry. We will think about it. You can go home now. I'll call you. I am trusting you! We will foil this marriage. You have my word. Well, why did you give your word that you'll foil this marriage? Because you are with me! Pavi! I don't have any cunning ideas with me. But you will manage to come up with something. Think about it. Why is he bringing the wedding date forward? Many are calling him, trying to foil the marriage, it seems. Even when I was with him, he got a couple of calls. Who else is trying to foil this wedding? - Hello. Mr. Ravi? We're calling you repeatedly because we're concerned about a girl's future. Just because you keep hanging up, the truths that we have to say won't get erased. At least now, you should show the willingness to listen to what we have to say! Please! Okay. Tell me. Is it? - He said he will listen. - Hello? - Hello? Mr. Ravi... Mr. Ravi! You found Bibeesh Balan, a heinous, dangerous, womanizing youngster, who is also a drug addict, to be your daughter's groom! That was your first mistake! This one! Idukki... Idukki Gold! A wicked creature who smokes Idukki Gold to fly high in the deep blue sky, watches blue films and goes lurking around on full moon nights. Are you so cruel as to give your precious daughter's hand to such a person, Mr. Ravindran Thaikkattil, owner of Hotel Ravindra? Such a lousy dialogue! Well, what do you gain by foiling this marriage? Gain? Next, I'm going to reveal an explosive truth that will leave you shell-shocked! Okay. Tell me. I'm ready to get shocked. There's a sex mafia which is flourishing in Mangalore. This Bibeesh Balan is a member of that mafia. Several cases are piled up in Mangalore North Police Station. This Bibeesh Balan is involved in all of them. Is it? Are you done? What's next? I think it didn't work. Final item. - Don't hang up! - Take your time. - One minute!. - Okay. Son! You're a great human being. I don't have your age and your maturity. Like everyone else, my family is important for me. One day... One day, unexpectedly... disturbing the peace of my family... disturbing the peace of my family, a youngster... a youngster named Bibeesh Balan... - came into our lives. - came into our lives. - He told me... - Stop, stop! - I've stopped. - I have also seen this movie. Where are you calling from? You won't know it even if I tell you. I'm not from around here. My house is in Thiruvananthapuram. I just know him from the time I was studying in Mangalore. So you're not from Kannur? No way! I was born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram. I've never been to Kannur at all. I swear on Lord Muthappan! - Ah! Now it's correct! - Thank you! I've understood everything! - Okay then. - Okay then. Okay. It was a clever idea to change my home-town, right? How was my trap? It was great! Kiran, is there any scene in your script that's not copied? Don't talk nonsense! Those are 'inspired' scenes, my friend. Crap! - Lord Muthappan! - Yes. - In Thiruvananthapuram? - Yes. The character I wrote was not such a fool, Abhiyetta! - Idiot! - Hey guys! Babeesh! Have you been waiting outside for a long time? No, I just came now. Why? Nothing. Why have you come here all of a sudden? That too, during this busy hour? It's my brother's pre-wedding shoot tomorrow. Where is it happening? Here itself. At Kooman fields. All of you should come. There will be stuff to carry. We will have a good time. Okay? Of course! - We will have a good time! - Yes. Shall I leave? Okay then. Okay. Well, why have you covered this phone with a cloth? It's having a fever! Kiran! We will find a way. I will have to make some corrections in the script. So the scene is at... The fields! "Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I" "I'm in love with your body" "I'm in love with the shape..." - Are you stressed, baby? - Just call me 'Chandrika'. I am calling you, right? Whichever loser it is, just call me by my name. Correct! Hey Mr. Bhupesh! Make it fast. Bibeesh, I'm not frying pappadams here! It will take some time to set this up! Well, she's getting worried. You do this. Reflect the sunlight directly onto him. Let him get burnt! Well, I feel this harsh sunlight is making my face lose its natural sheen! - Don't get stressed thinking about it. - No? We will whiten it using Photoshop. Bhupesh Kumar Photography! - It's quite something! - Yes. Of course! Santhosh Sivan is his Guru, right? Is it? Is he also a wedding photographer? - No. He is into catering business. - Oh, I see! Stop blabbering and hold the light. - You can relax. - Stand up straight, dears! Move your hands closer. Smile like this! Yes. Smile, my dear. - Won't you smile? - I asked you to smile, right? - Smile. - Smile, dear. You don't have to smile so much! Abhiyetta. Amal, get him some betel leaves to chew! Let Abhiyettan chew it and go red! Why do we need this set up from the movie 'Chandrolsavam'? Hey, this is a cinematic approach. Seeing this tragic face of Abhiyettan, Chandrika's mind should melt! 'My Abhiyetta!' She should say that and come running. But she's not even looking this way! You and your ridiculous ideas! Do something original, Kiran! You get lost! Abhiyetta! Last rehearsal. - Okay. - Okay. If anyone calls her by the nickname 'Froggy-face', she would sneer and curse them with all the expletives known to her. It's not 'Froggy-face'! It's 'Frog-eyed girl'! And your gesture is wrong. Not this! It should be the other one! Let the emotions flow, Abhiyetta. Come on. Emotions! Once, when I called her by that name, she didn't curse me. Instead, her eyes filled up. She must have done that thinking of your age! When I went to see Onam celebrations, she was the friend who sat with me, looking into each other's eyes. Oh! When I asked for the substitute dagger, - she said she forgot to take it! - What? That's a different movie, Abhiyetta! Oh! Sorry, sorry! She is the one... who's posing with someone else for a photo there. Oh! Fate! Yet, Chandrika... We will meet. Isn't this world an imaginary abode? Amal! Abhiyettan is improvising his lines! We will hit this out of the park! I wonder if they started early. We're not here to watch a movie, right? Come! Find out who the photographer is. We need to confiscate all the photos from him. Oh! Isn't that Bhupesh? The photos may not even get captured! Is it? Chandrika, Bibeesh! Both of you are going to get married, right? - Yes, yes. - Smile nicely, just like me. Hold her hand. Smart boy! That's not necessary. Let her look that way. I'll look the other way. A shot like this! Oh shit! Hey! Aren't you Bindu's son? Huh? Aren't you Bindu's son? Yes, I am. Oh no! Deviyechi again! She won't even let me create a turning point! He has brought some random girl. Look! Great going, boy! - Hey, isnâ€™t that Devi? - Where? Over there! On the other side. Oh my God! Will she be of any use to you, at least today? Had I asked her to foil this, she would've gotten them married by now. She must be saying something nasty to that girl. It won't do us any good, right? It's not her. Her dad should hear it, right? But she is talking with a smile. It must be really nasty then. Hey, who is that? This is Chandrika, Raviyettan's daughter. Ravi, who's running a hotel in Eyyanadu? I've seen her when she was a little child. - Is it? - What are you both doing here? Have you come here to shoot a film? No, Aunty. - It's our wedding. - What? Wedding! Oh my God! What am I hearing? Wedding? You still have a running nose like a child, and you're getting married? - What's the problem? - What? I'm an adult! So why not? Did your breathlessness get cured? Oh my goodness! Your mom keeps saying that you're always puffing! That's not what you think it is, Chandrika. No, it's actually what you thought. But I stopped it. I quit. Bibeesh Balan knows the tricks to woo a girl... who hasn't seen the world beyond Perumba river. She had studied in Mangalore, buddy. That's not relevant here. I have... - Abhiyetta! - What is this? - Come here. - Take him away, Amal! Why did you have to listen to that guy? When he said you'll spout dialogues, I didn't expect this much! The beauty of that scene is gone! Come on! You're done talking, right? Ready! That boy has always been sick with some disease or the other. Hey girl! Take good care of him. Okay? He is an ailing child. Sigh! I hope his diseases get cured, at least after he gets married. - Hey lady! - Huh? Why are you taunting me? Taunting you? What's that? You came to cut grass, right? Cut it and leave! Go! No! Well, will this programme continue till evening? Yes. It will continue for a long time. No, it won't. We will stop this now. What? You'll stop it now? Click! One minute. I have a trick! "Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I" Chandrika, Bhupeshettan has been telling you for some time now, right? - Can't you be a little more romantic? - Yes! You do your job! Just a minute. 60 seconds. Okay? This is my job, right? Damn shoot! - Listen. - Yes. - I will set up the camera. - Okay. You should go near her and kiss her without telling her. - What? Me? - Should I do it then? Well... No. I will capture it candidly. When Bhupeshettan does something, it should be unique. - True that. - You'll get its result too. - I'll get the result? - Of course! - That's enough. - Go on. - Bless me! - Wish you all success! - Fast, fast! - First kiss! - All the best, Bibeesh! - Ready! This will be a fantastic click. Ready? I'm going to give it to her. Chandrika! - Oh no! - The result is quite the opposite. Oh my God! My eyes! - I can't see anything! - Shall we leave? We can't leave. Our equipments are here, right? Pack up! You gave him a good one, right? - Yes. - Poor fellow! Poor fellow? He deserved even more! Will it be a problem if your parents come to know about this? I won't tell my parents. It's a shame for him, right? He won't tell his family either. What? The news must have reached both families by now. How come? My aunt is missing! Hey Bindu! Where are you? What are you saying, Deviyechi? You must have imagined it. Oh no! Why should lie to you? If something bad happens to your son, won't it worry me too? You won't like it if I say the truth, right? He is also at fault. What? Why did he kiss her when all those people were watching? - Were there people watching? - Yes. By people, I mean... His friends were there. Let him come home! That dog! He got slapped by her before the marriage! That's what I am saying! That's what I am saying! Just because he tried to kiss... That too, a girl who told him that she likes him. Will such a girl slap? Overall, I noticed... that she was uninterested. She is sad, man! She is sad because I'm going to Dubai. Is that why she gave a great farewell right on your face? Tell me the truth, Bibeesh. There's something fishy about this. Or else, why would she slap you... after getting ready and coming for the photoshoot? She slapped me, right? Why is that a problem for you? Oh no! Are you bleeding? Am I bleeding? No. It just swelled up. That's all. It is said that... It is said that every person has seven others who look like them. Hasn't this stopped yet? But the guy who's supposed to see all this... passed out too soon. That's my regret! I have a solution for that. Abhiyetta! Get up, Abhiyetta! The battles are not over yet. Is it a political meeting? What is this guy blabbering? Well, dear... Did I go overboard after drinking? Not at all! It was perfect! Hey guys! How do you arrive precisely at the end of each scene? You got a good slap, right? Mumma asked me to bring you home! - Huh? Mumma came to know? - Yes. - Who told her? - I don't know. Who told her? Where were you, Wonder Woman? I was in the Amazon Isles! Why? What were you doing there? I went there to watch your Mom's cinematic dance! Stop there! Why did you go to Bindu Chechi's house? Who told you that? What did you tell her? We were just talking about life, in general. That's all. Why? Do you talk about life in general while cutting grass? - Tell me. Whom did you gossip about? - I don't want to tell you. Move aside! Tell me whom you favoured when you spoke to her. You don't have to worry. I haven't told her anything that would foil the marriage. Anyway, you never do anything useful for me, right? - What? - I didn't say anything. Get lost! He didn't say anything, it seems! You and your lies! Yes, Chandretta. Tell me. Pavi, when I went to the hotel today, didn't I tell you about someone who called to foil the marriage? Yes, you did. I noticed something when we were at the field today. Your boys... were standing over there, at a distance. If possible, go and ask them. We can find out what's their stance on this marriage, right? There's a folk art performance tonight. I'll try to get it out of them today. Okay. Just try. My mother and sister never used to go against my father's words! I can understand why the townsfolk want to foil the marriage. But... if the people in this house start doing it.... I know what has to be done now! Hey! What's up? You guys are nowhere to be seen nowadays! - Where were you? - You're the one who's gone missing now. You're always with Chandrettan! We didn't call thinking that you'd be busy meeting prospective brides. Nothing like that. Marriage is like a coconut on top of a fence, right? Yes. Why are you so silent? This is not how you are normally, right? Life has to go on, Paviyetta. No one can stop it, right? What? It's nothing. Abhiyettan read some novel in the morning. Yes, yes. A novel. Why were you guys standing at a distance, after coming for Bibeesh's photoshoot? Did you come there? Well, I just passed by. We were upset that he didn't invite us for his wedding till now. But he's our friend after all. So, we thought we'd go there. - That's good. - Yes. Why did you ask that? - Nothing. I just asked. - Oh! Just like that? Will it happen soon? It will happen within 1.5 months, right? 1.5 months. - In 1.5 months? - Yes. How does it matter if it's in 1.5 or 2 months or tomorrow? We just have to attend the wedding, right? - Isn't it, Pavi Chetta? - Yes, yes. Hey guys! What is it? Any more negative news? We're getting scared seeing you arrive! No negatives. It's all positive. Brother's wedding has been brought ahead. Huh? The wedding is happening in three days! Three days? Wedding... in 3 days! You're happy, right? Aren't you? Kiran! We're not going to wait for Sujina Chechi to get married. We're planning to conduct it on the coming Wednesday. Wedding! Phew! Such a positive news! Isn't it? Full positive, right? - Yes, yes. - That's what I said, right? I came here to tell you this. Everyone should be here. No one should leave. Okay? The picture is not yet over! Mumma! - Babeesh! - Don't worry guys. - What happened? - Nothing happened. - See you at the wedding! - Okay. It's Bibeesh's wedding. Such a positive news, right? Of course. Only three days left, right? He is our friend, right? Bibeesh's wedding is like our own wedding. Yes, yes. - We'll get going then. - Yes, yes. We need to buy some porridge for Abhiyettan. I need some too. - Bibeesh! - Abhiyetta, shall we leave? Why are you here in the morning itself? I'm unable to sleep. What happened? I called you and told you everything last night, right? Oh! That's the issue? Didn't I tell you that we'll find a solution? Hey Chandretta! What solution? Only three days are left. The wedding will happen on the fourth day. He will marry her and go away. I won't get Sujina. We have three long nights and days, right? What? What is so long, Chandretta? There are not many days left! Sujina was really stressed when she called me. Let's just do what we're sure of. Fine? My brain is spinning! Well, - shall we tell him? - Tell whom? - Bibeesh. - You want to tell the groom? You want to ask the groom to foil the marriage? What rubbish are you saying? What will we do then? - Let me think. - Make it fast. Sheesh! Where are you coming? At a time, only one person can defecate here! Give it to me. Rubbish! Amal! Abhiyetta! Get up, get up! Why are you waking me up in the morning itself, Kiran? I'll go home and come back. I need to share some very complicated matters with you. Before going home, listen to it. Sounds very dark! We are going to commit a huge betrayal to Bibeesh! Weren't we doing that all this while? This is another betrayal that can never be undone. A womanising case! Viral video! You mean...? Hey, it's not a big deal. It's just a small video of him dancing while he's drunk. Will that be create such a huge issue? What if he is dancing with a girl? Isn't that enough for someone to be humiliated in our town? A girl? You mean Cabaret dance? Oh no, no! We have to consider the family audience as well. Sheesh! In the end, we will also be humiliated, Kiran. I'm warning you. Nothing will happen. You have an old house, right? Nobody is staying there, right? No. So what? Yes! LED speaker, light, smoke. All set! Let the programme happen over there. At dusk, today. Abhiyettan should be there with all the arrangements for a booze party. We will invite Bibeesh there, saying that it's our treat. He will definitely come if the booze is free. As soon as he arrives, we will get him drunk. We will make him dance with the girl. We will shoot a video. We will send to the townsfolk and the families and make it viral! He will get humiliated and the wedding will be cancelled! You are so clever, Kiran! You will take Malayalam cinema to a different level. Wait and watch! I know, I know. Well, these are the list of art properties. Arrange everything. - We will go and come back. - Where to? It won't be viral if he dances alone, right? There should be a girl, right? Amal and I will go get one! Yes, yes. For things like this, people like us should be going. Whatever be the risk involved, we will bring a girl! Well, will there be anyone near your house? That won't be a problem. There are very few houses in that deserted area. - In that deserted area? - Yes, there. There are very few houses there. And not many people too. How will we bring him there? For that, tell him that your scooter's tyre got punctured... and ask him to come there. I'll take care of the rest. Well, will he agree if we call him and talk to him? Sigh! Was I playing a violin to a deaf elephant so far? We are not bringing him there to pamper him. It is to break his hands and legs! What are you saying? We can foil this marriage only if he's admitted in the hospital for a week. And yeah, no one will know anything, since it will be really dark. Just a mild dose would do. I'll get you beaten too, for the sake of originality. Won't it be a police case and become an issue? Isn't he an innocent fellow? Why? Aren't you innocent? After being decent for so long, what happened to you? He is a young chap. He still has a lot of time. We must do what we're supposed to. And then, the police. Let them come. We're not directly involved, right? We've been following your ideas so far, right? Let's see. Or else, we'll let it be. Do this. Call Bibeesh. We'll know what's his plan for the day. - Okay. - Call him. - Paviyettan! - Yes. I heard everything. It's at that deserted area, right? Where are you now? So you've decided to hit, right? Hey! Why would I do such a thing? Well, when Chandrettan said so... Please forgive me! What? What are you saying, Paviyetta? Tonight is my bachelor party at the deserted area, right? Organised by our club! We will rock, Paviyetta! Rock! Won't you be there? - Paviyetta? - Yes. I will come. Okay. Then, it's all set! At the deserted area. We will hit the bottle till our heads explode! Yes. We should hit it, right Paviyetta? Yes! God is on our side, Chandretta! What happened? The deserted area plan is ON! Mumma! I'm going for the party, Mumma! - Go wherever you want! - Bye! - You will never mend your ways! - He has started. I'm tired looking after you! - Okay. Miss you too, Mumma! - Get lost! Now I will have to eat all this rice I made, right? Oh Mumma! - He has started his bike. - Okay. Okay, Mumma! Bye! "Bye, Mumma! Bye, Mumma! Bye!" He has left the house. He's wearing a white shirt and jeans. Okay? - Hello? Hello? Come near the banyan tree on the scooter. - Okay. Welcome! Welcome, Chechi! Kiran, where is our... Huh? Amal, is that you? How will that work? He will recognize him the moment he sees him, right? Let him recognize. Though this is Amal for him, in the video, it will look like a girl. We won't show the girl's face in the video that we're going to leak. It's my director's brilliance! Brilliant, brilliant! Don't you know that I don't agree to do such things usually? But since this is a unique approach, I thought I'll do this. It's for you after all, Abhiyetta! The two of you are going through a lot of trouble for me, right? Hey, don't think about it that way. We don't have any other job, right? - And this is an entertainment, right? - Of course! Anyway, I've boosted my self-confidence and courage. Is it? - See? - Nice! He is waiting there. Let's go there quickly. - Art properties are all set, right? - Yes. Much more than you asked for! Perfect! Come on! Let's go, girl! Get lost! When you him him, your mask should not come off, come what may! Okay. Correct! All the best! Come. Hey Chandretta, he has gone for a booze party, right? What if he doesn't come back? What if he gets sloshed and passes out over there? Either we will have to wait for him here all night... - Or else? - Or else... Or else, we will have to wait here all night. Well, you do one thing. The need is ours. If it gets really late, switch off the main switch outside and hit him. Well, Chandretta... He is not alone over there. The boys are also there, right? Will I end up getting beaten by the boys at this age? They haven't gone there to have dessert! Everyone will be sloshed. Find him and beat him. - Chandretta. - Yes. We just have to make sure that we don't smash his head. You know many weddings I've foiled, Pavi? Come. We will foil this one too! For some originality, shall we set these bikes on fire? No, that's not necessary! Sheesh! I was joking, buddy. You're too much! Wow! Chicken! This is good! We need to have a blast for the wedding, right? Of course! We will blow it up like no one has ever seen before! Abhiyetta, please don't be upset with me. Never! Every person will have to take certain decisions in their lives, right? - Dude, this is very common, right? - Yes. Everyone has to take a decision, right? Yes, yes. So, there's no point in being upset with anyone. Yes, correct! Even in the near future, I might have to take some decisions. And I might not be able to inform you guys. Please don't be upset because of that. Oh, we won't get upset about it. But you shouldn't get upset either. Well, I know you won't get upset, Abhiyetta. Yes, yes. We know that you know it! We'll take it as it comes, man! Have a drink now. Well... Paviyettan said he will come, right? - Paviyettan will come. You drink it. - Yes. You've fixed a light drink, right? It doesn't even look like I've fixed a drink! I'm keeping it light. I don't want to drink too much. That's why. Don't worry. Drink it. - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! - Well, Chandretta. - Yes. In my life so far, I've never experienced such a night! Though we're hiding here to attack him in the dark, it feels like we're waiting here for a historical moment. Historical moment? What's that historical moment? - My wedding. - Wedding? One step at a time, Pavi! I'm happy with this step. My opinion is that people who are so innocent, shouldn't get married! - Innocent? - Yes. Who? Me? I do mix water in the milk that I distribute at the dairy society. Oh, I've heard it earlier. Not just that. Sometimes, I tamper with the readings at the dairy society as well. Now, tell me. Am I innocent? Are these such big crimes, Pavi? Coming to think of differently, if we were already married, would we have experienced this night? Would we? No, we can't! We can't, we can't, we can't! We cannot experience any of this after marriage. This night... will be pass by. The wedding... will also get done. But this moment! This moment! This second, this soda! We won't get these back again! No way! Tonight... will be a long night! Of course! Guys, you can crack all sorts of jokes tonight. You can use all kinds of cruel words. I won't say anything. Do you know why? You know why? We're not going to get this moment back! No! Bibeesh! Bibeesh! Hey! Sit down, Biibeesh! Sit down. I will speak! I am sad. I need to speak about the pain in my heart! You can speak! I hurt Abhiyettan. This Bibeesh hurt him. Bibeesh shouldn't have done that. But what other option did Bibeesh have? Bibeesh loved her, right? I was in love! Madly, deeply! But I must share two naked truths today. That too, shocking ones! Go ahead! Truth number one. That girl, Chandrika Ravindran... She's not the one who saw and liked me. It was me who saw and liked her. My family went to her house asking for her hand because I asked them to. This is the truth! Truth, the truth! Found the peanuts! Bibeesh, you are so cruel! Nothing was intentional, right Abhiyetta? You know, that's life! Shit happens! But my decision... I won't change that! - Shall I fix another drink for you? - No! Or I'll have one more! Make it light. Okay? Light... small. All of us had three pegs each. So, just go ahead and drink it! If the Director tells me, I will drink it! But make it light. Okay? - I... - Light! I need to tell you something. Yes, you proceed. You're not a scoundrel. You're a dirty rotten scoundrel! Here's your dirty rotten drink! Here! Have it! Yes! I admit. I admit! Well, Chandretta. Will we have to admit him in the hospital? He won't be able to raise his hands to tie the nuptial chain. But I can't say whether he has to be admitted or not. Let's hope nothing bad happens! Well Pavi, have you really come here to beat him up? If this is the case, you'll ask for his permission before beating him up! I'm getting more and more anxious with each passing moment. He will come. What is it? It's my phone. - Hello. - Hey. Hello. You go to bed. I'll come soon. I won't go to bed until you come. Well, why are you whispering like this? Should I cry out loud instead? Didn't I tell you that I'm going for some important work? Is it time to get you married, son? Ugh! You realised that at the middle of the night? Just hang up! Next bottle! I just need a light drink, Kiran. I can't drink too much. I really can't! - We know that! - That's right! What's the truth number two? Say that! Truth number two! I won't say it now. Come on, say it now. You're our precious pearl, right? Say it. It's not time for that yet. When it's the right time to reveal that, you'll come to know about it, after a day. This is not fair, man! Oh, you just wait, man! Fix me another drink! Hey, I just need a strong one. Okay? I don't need a light one. I don't want it to be light. That's why. I don't need a light one. Before fixing and having any more drinks, a small surprise for you! Surprise? What surprise? The bachelor party you saw so far is not what you're going to witness hereafter. Abhiyetta! Lights on! Play the music! Action! Hey Amal! Wow! Yellow! "Don't you disappear, O' rainbow!" "This is our honeymoon night" "Your seductive radiance is giving me goosebumps" "Don't you disappear, O' rainbow!" "This is our honeymoon night" "Your seductive radiance is giving me goosebumps" "The night has awakened" "My desire has blossomed" "The night has awakened" "My desire has blossomed" Did you see this? Did you see my filmmaking skills? I have to capture some legendary shots now. Legendary shot! "This mist and the full moon has prepared a bedroom for us" "These two hearts will unite in that bedroom" "Don't you disappear, O' rainbow!" "This is our honeymoon night" "Your seductive radiance is giving me goosebumps" - You finished it? - No. I'll finish it now. Buggers! You haven't left even a drop for me? They didn't leave anything for you? They didn't leave anything for you? You all are drunk! - What will I do now? - Hey! Rupesh has half a bottle with him. We kept it as a reserve. For whom? For you, dear! Go and bring it. One of you go and bring it. I won't go! 'Drink and drive' is an offence, man! So, everything you did so far were correct? - I'll go and get it. - Okay. Are you going in this attire? That's not possible. Give me my phone! Here you go! Helmet and key. - Get going! - Ungrateful dogs! Make it light! Make it light! Make it light! "Friends are such ungrateful fellows" - Chandretta! - What? Someone is coming out. Is it him? Let me flash the torchlight and see. Flash it just once. Okay? Huh? Lightning? "Friends are such scoundrels" Chandretta, it's him. White shirt! Wear the mask and go catch him! - Me? - No, we'll bring others for this! Just go quickly! "Friends are such scoundrels" "Or... are scoundrels my friends?" Didn't I take the keys? Ah, it's there. Oh no! Just miss! - Oh no! - Sorry! Sorry! Who are you? Let go of me! - Kiran! - Yes. Do you hear that sound? Who are you? - Oh my God! - Yes, I can hear it. - Can you hear it? - Yes. - Isn't that Amal? - Yes. Come quickly! Who is it? Who is beating up Amal? Abhiyettan is here! - How dare you touch my boys? - Hey! Did you just hit Pavi? Pavi! Switch off the light, Aunty! You won't even let me sleep! My dear Paviyetta! Paviyettan! Make it light! I will have only strong drinks! Make it really light! Make it light! Go and take rest, man! Okay. When you said that your sister had an affair, I never expected it to be Abhi. But you never asked me who it was, right? I've heard her mentioning "Abhiyettan' often. How will I know that it's your friend? Understood. I have some plans in mind. I'll tell you soon. Okay? You are okay, right? Yeah, I am totally fine. Where do they cast the plaster, Chetta? They usually cast it where there's a fracture. - Why? - Huh? - Sheesh! - I'll call you later. What's the next step? - My funeral! - Okay. Are you in pain, boy? No. When I think about her, there's a weight on my chest. I wasn't asking you, Abhi! How are you, boy? It hurts a little bit. Luckily, nothing major happened, right? A single word. If you had said a single word to us... Well, I was wondering how I could say this to you. But I never knew that you were taking much more efforts. How much time did we waste? If you had said what you told us at the last minute, a little earlier, we could have done so much more! Yes, yes. Why aren't you saying anything, Abhiyetta? I'm not scared anymore! Haven't you realized now that I wasn't lying when I said that she likes me? You don't have to be scared at all. The wedding is happening day after tomorrow. We will do something before that, right? Who? You are all with me, right? So, it looks like a lot more pounding is on the way. Hey! Is this a market? Everyone step out! Only the one who was beaten up should be here. Well, all of us were more or less beaten up, sister. Oh! - Your eyes look pale! - Is this his case file? No. It belongs to the patient who got discharged sometime back. - Does it hurt here? - No. Huh? Why is that so? Shambhu Mahadevan! What had happened to this patient, Sister? He got beaten up from somewhere. - Is it? - Seemed like he was royally thrashed. His nose was crushed. And on top of that, diarrhoea. Bye, Sister! Poor fellow! Before he wakes up, we need to do something about that video. Give me your phone. What happened to this? I think it broke during last night's fight. It's not even turning on! This was too much, Paviyetta! We took so much effort to shoot it! Did I rent all those lights and buy all that booze for this? What is it? Why are we here? Nothing. Just a small accident. What happened to him? That's Amal. Luckily, he is not injured. What? - What happened to you, Paviyetta? - Accident. While I was riding with Chandrettan, we crashed on to his bike. Is it? That's such a coincidence, right? - True! - Yes, yes. I'm having a severe headache. Didn't you make the drinks light yesterday? Yes, of course! Then why did this happen? Oops! I'm late! Mumma must be looking for me. Let me get going. Shirt? Here's your shirt. What is this? What happened to me, Abhiyetta? Hey! I am innocent! Nothing happened. Something happened to me. You aren't telling me! Nothing happened, dude! There's nothing, dude. You go home. Mumma will be looking for you. It's your wedding, day after tomorrow. Oh yes, yes! - Shall I leave? Bye! - Okay. - Where are my shoes? - Here you go. I'm really late. So, even the last door is closed now. Huh? The climax is yet to happen, right? Since we all have united like the Avengers, it's going to be the 'End game'! I have the script with me. Dude, we don't need your script anymore. I'll share an idea. It's slightly old fashioned. - But it will still work. - Say it! - Elopement! - Sheesh! Cliche, cliche! Shall I give you a kick? After getting me beaten up, you're calling it cliche? You say it, Paviyetta. Listen. We'll take Chandrika and him to some temple and get them married. Then, we will make them stay somewhere else for sometime. I'll marry Sujina, acting as if I don't know anything about it. Once I marry Sujina, I'll be the main man over there, right? Once I become the main man, he can come back anytime, right? That will be awesome! You have such a great story sense, Paviyetta! I am like that sometimes. But how will we execute all this? There is one way. If we need to do it in secret, Aurankadu temple will be the perfect place. I know someone over there as well. I'll arrange everything over there. Now I'll show you the plan. This is Aurankadu temple. This is Eyyanadu. This is Kooman Thonda. This is Kavunchola. We can't go to the temple through Kavunchola... because the bridge over there has collapsed. Moreover, she has relatives all over that place. If they catch us, they will kill us. Yes, they are very influential over there. From Eyyanadu, we will bring her to Aurankadu through Kooman Thonda. After that, Check! Bibeesh's house is on the way from Kooman Thonda to Aurankadu. - Oh! - That's a risk. Oh no! That's true. But we need to take that risk. Since it will be early morning, let's assume that there won't be too many problems. - That's a plus point. - That's true. So, you guys have to wait below the Banyan tree near Kooman Thonda. Okay. Chandrettan and I will bring her near the Banyan tree, crossing all these paths. From there, all of us will go to the temple together. There, the two of you will get married. But boys... if things have to work smoothly... She is at her house over here, right? She has to come out from there, right? Will she come out? Will she? You should unite us somehow, Paviyetta. You're proposing an idea that needs so much thought! If you're planning to do it tonight... Even otherwise, you men are all like this. You decide everything on your own. We won't even have a choice! Well, I understood what you're saying. But we don't have much time. That's why... Well, we will do it only if you are okay with it. If not, let's forget it. It's better than being forced into a wedding you don't like, right? That's why I said so. Or is it because you don't trust me? It's not because we don't trust you. I haven't told anything to Abhiyettan yet. And if we have to elope all of a sudden, he should also agree, right? Is this about him? Why wouldn't he agree? He will agree. Anyway, I am there, right? If you still have doubts, call him and ask him. Right? I will come. I will inform Abhiyettan myself. I'll come out after everyone at home goes to sleep. Oh my God! What am I seeing? There she goes again! Who smashed your head? - Nobody smashed me. - Then what? A coconut seed fell on my head while I was there. Will that cause so much damage? It was a big ripe seed! It must be a coconut then. A coconut fell on your head and this is all that happened? The villagers beat me to a pulp! Are you satisfied now? Oh! Tell me the truth! Didn't you go to Pukkalam Sandhya's house last night? Sheesh! Is this how an aunt is supposed to talk? You know it, right? I've told you earlier, right? I'm a youngster who has many connections in the society. So, I'll have several things to deal with. Can I share all of them with you? Isn't that what I said, right? You went to her for a good deal! Please leave! Go and give some water to the calf. First, I'll give it to the buffalo! After that, I'll give it to the calf. You and your big mouth! Nothing is happening in your own life, because you're always helping others. Such an unlucky fellow! Are you stressed? No. Any sentiments towards our parents? Their daughter... her choice... They don't have any such sentiments either, right? If we fear them and don't do what you like, we will have to continue doing it all the time. Just stay cool. What you said earlier is true. When I was 20 years old, my fate was to cut grass and collect cow dung. Just because I am unlucky, should I stop trying? I have no idea of the outcome of what I am going to do today. Whenever I try to do something, there are too many obstacles. I'm tired of losing! I don't have anyone else. Please pray for me. Son! So, have you become a regular customer of Pukkalam Sandhya? Huh? Pavi! Pavithra, don't we have to leave? - Hey Chandretta. - Yes. Are the two of you.... going together for such shady jobs? So, Pavithran told you everything, right Devi? I have to do this for him at least now, right? This is all we can do, right? So you're the one who has been advising him to do all this? Not just advising him... I'm the one who instructs him what to do, standing behind him. Sheesh! This man has no shame! Shame? For what? Isn't all this very common? Oh my God! What am I hearing at this twilight hour? You close the door and go to bed. I'll be late. - Devi. - What? Shall I leave then? Huh? Please zip your mouth for some time, buddy! "Abhiyettan" Shall we go? We will miss this club, right? 'No pain, no gain', right? But the gain is only for you, right? - Oh, come on! - Guys! We'll lock it up, get in the car and leave. If anyone asks anything, - we're going to shoot a short film! - Of course! The villagers should know the truth only tomorrow morning. Sure! Okay. Sumalatha! Sasi Chetta! The three of us are going for a shoot. The most important thing to note here... is that we will be back only after a few days. You go wherever you want! Why do I care? Come on, Sasi Chetta! Spread love! Get lost! My dear buddy! Please don't go overboard! Let me bring this ashore somehow! Please! Please do! Buddy, please! Get in! Buddy! My Dog! "Not you or him" "She has cast her eyes on me" "She has cast her eyes on me" Who else would she stare at? You told everything to Devi, right? What? - That we're coming here? - Yes. No way! I haven't told anything to aunt. Yeah, right! She already thinks that I'm getting out at night to go to a brothel. - Going to a brothel? - Yes. Shucks! Sheesh! I told her a lot of stuff, not knowing this. I have to correct myself, Pavi! Come! Start the car. Stay calm and sit there! No, no! What would Devi think about me? She won't think anything. No! She will think something! Sheesh! - Chandretta. - What? Is it only because of your affection for me... that you stood by me all this while bearing all the trouble? Why do you ask that? Well, in my entire life, I've never seen such a righteous person like you. That's why I asked. Get lost! - Do you really like my aunt that much? - What? Hey Pavi! Hey... well... You can say it. It's alright. What can I say, Pavi? You little devil! This village is brimming with lovers! This entire world, Pavi! Love is the more important than anything else, right? Yes, love is more important than anything else! - Spread love! - Absolutely! It's so late. She is nowhere to be seen! That beast must have slept by now, right? What's he doing at this midnight hour? "An endless night, a dark night, a troublesome night" "Why aren't you appearing in the sky, O' full moon?" "An anxious night, a terrifying night" "It's pitch dark all around" "The eyes are looking for the flames of dreams that will appear tomorrow" "Theft is a sin" "But love in the heart is even more intense" "If we win, we'll reach the heavens" "If we fail, we'll be depressed" "It's a war on the way" "Long back, the mighty hero Ram, along with his brother and his army of monkeys" "Went to Lanka, looking for Sita" "And here, again tonight, to save another Sita" "This midnight gang is ready" "There's no shame, there's no time" "If the town comes to know, it will be terrible" "This night ride will ruin our reputation" "There's no shame, there's no time" "If the town comes to know, it will be terrible" "This night ride will ruin our reputation" "Like eloping is written on both the horoscopes" "For two people with the same fate to unite" "The controversial, brainless heroes have dived into the house" "All their thoughts and emotions are occupied with the wedding" "Theft is a sin" "But love in the heart is even more intense" "If we win, we'll reach the heavens" "If we fail, we'll be depressed" "It's a war on the way" Get in! Get in! Get in! Let's go, let's go! Chase! "A troublesome night" "Why aren't you appearing in the sky, O' full moon?" Hey! Why is there a crowd in front of Bibeesh's house? Don't bother about it. You keep driving, Pavi! - He is our Bibeesh, right? - Shucks! What's with this crowd here, Abhiyetta? They must have come asking for donations. - So many people? - Yes. - Let me go check. - Stop, stop! - Paviyetta? - Don't stop. You keep going! - What is it? - There is no problem. Go, go! If I leave without knowing what it is, it will be like standing on a thorn! - I'll be back soon. - Hey Pavi! Wait! Where are you going? What is this? Did too much of virtuousness make him crazy? Hey Pavi! Suretta. What's the issue over there? Eloping on the day before marriage! We are all fools, right? Bibeesh is missing! She is also missing! There was a call from Chandrika's house. I'm sure that they have fled village together. Bibeesh...? One day... If they had waited for one more day, they could have enjoyed their honeymoon, right? They are not right! This whole generation is not right! Yes, yes. Some people have helped them. I have a doubt on the boys at your club. Well, where are you going? Don't we have to look for them? I'll go and check at the bus stand. - Well, you should be here. Okay? - I will be! Hey Paviyetta! Paviyetta! Stop there! Why are you lurking around here? Hey... that... I... Here you go. Brother asked me to give this to you. Shall I leave then? Hey! Did you get him? I didn't. I'll inform you when I get him. My dearest Paviyetta, Abhiyetta, Kiran, Amal. Except you guys, I'm not leaving letters for anybody else. I'm not telling anyone. She slapped me! A tight slap! She slapped me at the field in front of so many people! I'm soft-hearted. I felt really bad! She is having a complex... because she is not as rich as me! I'm soft-hearted. I felt really bad! Now, let me be a bit poetic. I sat alone and in a crowd. I scuffled in seclusion. Aren't you not ashamed? Green light glittered at midnight. - I hate you! - Mumma's torture gushed from within. Are you not ashamed? To a secluded chat box, she came back and took a seat. Storming sorrowful soul... melted like ice! Jennifer! She was my ex. Now, she is my 'Vicks'! Our problem got fixed. I went for a superb six! That is a superb shot! Now, coming to the second truth that I was going to tell you. My ex and I are all set! Again! You guys are my darlings! Abhiyettan is my wealth. I dumped Chandrika! Leaving my home and my family, I'm marching ahead! We won't be seeing each other again. Consider that my wedding is over! Let me take my leave... returning the glowing and vigorous Chandrika to Abhiyettan! From the most soft-hearted, Signed, Bibeesh Balan. Paviyetta! You're going through a good time. Buy a lottery ticket. You'll win it! True! You will win it! You naughty boy! I was adamant that I wanted a happy ending. It's an awesome shirt, Abhiyetta! It's 'Lenin'! Abhiyettan's life is how a life should be! - Paviyetta. - Yes. So now, we both are... going to be co-brothers, right? Of course! Then, let's not delay it. Let's do it quickly! Yes! They came at the right time! - Come fast. - Five minutes. He will be here soon. - Who else is left to come? - Abhiyettan. - Joking at this hour? Come! - Come quickly! 'Abhimon' 'Kuttan Abhimon' Am I late? It's me, Abhishek. The two of us went for PSC coaching together. I used to like Abhiyettan, even before that. - Is it? - Yes. Oh! I didn't know about that. Who is... Paviyettan? Me... Me... I'm so happy! Though you don't know me at all, you considered me as your own friend... and did so much for me! I don't know how to thank you all. All of you are so large-hearted! So large-hearted! I won't be able to forget this. I'll forever be grateful for this. One minute. Since I left quickly, I couldn't bring any clothes. A shirt...? It's okay even if it's big for me. "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" "Should I get rid of your tears?" "Should I show you the full moon?" "Should I get rid of your tears?" "Should I show you the full moon?" "Should I share my golden dreams with you, forever?" "Should I share them?" "O' my singing beauty, will you enter the shamiana" "And promise to come home as my wife?" "And promise to come home as my wife?" Don't buy any lottery ticket now. Even if you win, you won't get the prize! He was going to surprise his Grandma with this wedding. Look at him now! What I had imagined was a... feel-good, family, comedy entertainer! You shut up! It was your script... that created all these problems. He waited 13 years for her... and she married someone else with the same name! That's what I'm thinking! Such an unfortunate guy! Hey! Allow Abhiyettan at least to mourn peacefully. Don't you worry. My script, Paviyettan's idea, last twist! I will mix everything and rock it! Like how you rocked his family life, right? I was just trying to help, and now I've destroyed his family life? Sort out that Sujina's case somehow, Paviyetta. Won't you? I haven't had a wedding feast from this area for a while now. Abhi... I have understood something now. If we use half this planning and effort for something else, all of us will become successful in life! You should get a job first. We will see the rest later. We will see. - Hey, I'm leaving. - Okay. Get up, dude! I'm wondering about something else. Where did that Bibeesh run off to? "Running" Rocky! Come quickly! - Hi! - "Running through the fields" - This is Rocky, my friend. - Hi. You came from Thrissur to help me, right Rocky? Come along with us to Bakkalam. You don't have to worry, dude. I'll be there in 2 days, right? I'm busy at the moment. That's why. By the time you reach there and settle down, I'll come there. Okay? Bakkalam is a very safe place. Not that, dude! I am getting cold feet! No need for any cold feet! You see this guy here? I know this Bro. He has years of experience in such matters! How many years of experience? I don't know the exact number. But he does have many years of experience. Okay then. Go and return safely, Bro! Thank you, dear! - Take care! - Get in. Get in, get in. Okay then. Watch your leg! Bro! They are very close to me. Take care. Look after them. - Shall I leave, dear? - Okay. Wonder what will happen to them! - Are you stressed, dear? - No. - Shall we leave, Bro? - Yes. Why are you staring like this? What happened? I feel like I've seen your face somewhere. Where? Hey, no way! I'm seeing this type of face for the 1st time. - You're eloping for the first time, right? - Yes, first time! I'm also doing this for the first time. I have a bit too much of this helping mentality. Well, what happened to your nose, Bro? I just got a photo clicked, when I went to act. Oh! You're an actor, right? No, nothing like that. He is an actor! - Shall we start? - Okay. Come close, Jenny! Bro, it's a new beginning! Please play a soothing song. I'll play it right away! "Who is sprinkling pearls of smiles within my eyes, my dear?" "It's you, who wrote love poems within my heart since forever" "Who is sprinkling pearls of smiles within my eyes, my dear?" "It's you, who sang love songs in my ears since forever" I don't have money. I'll pay through GPay. - Isn't that enough? - Yes. Number? "O' girl, I am a bird imprisoned in your love cage" "When you appear before me, I get the jitters and shivers" "While you talk to me coyly, I feel tender within" "I am tempted to be the mole on your red cheeks" "Who is sprinkling pearls of smiles within my eyes, my dear?" "It's you, who wrote love poems within my heart since forever" "When I am tired all alone, what am I searching for?" "It's your pretty face, my sweetheart" "When you lean on his shoulder, you are a boon for him" "You are a sea of compassion that gets rid of his tears" "Who is sprinkling pearls of smiles within my eyes, my dear?" "It's you, who wrote love poems within my heart since forever" Everyone stand closely! Everyone look at the camera! Smile! Let me click a candid photo! Just a minute! Where is Kiran? Kiran Babu Nelliyath. You've achieved both box office success and critical acclaim. Doesn't it feel like a dream beginning? Dream! One minute. Even this very moment... I'm in a situation where I can't realize whether this is a dream or reality. If you can talk in this situation, please tell us something about your next movie. My next movie is the sum total of all the dreams... that I dreamed alone and also with others. "But why, Chandrika?" Spread love! "But why, Chandrika?" "My body is aflame with the fire of love" "But why, Chandrika?" "Don't look away from me when I come in front of you" "Struck by the arrow she sends with her pearly eyes" "There's a sweet pain trembling inside" "Holding her hands that have several twinkling bangles" "When will I get to celebrate my honeymoon?" "There are a thousand expectations" "All the disappointments will be gone" "So much trouble, so much sorrow, so terrifying" "The full moon girl is getting married at sunrise tomorrow" "Get all the weapons you can" "I need to go across the shore and create a furore" "And bring the pretty girl back, holding her hands" "You've been a desire, that I have waited my entire life for" "We shouldn't get separated like the lovers in Changampuzha's poem" "Our dreams shouldn't be killed"
