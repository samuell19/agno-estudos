(birds chirping) - You men go on down the river and see if you can pick up some tracks. (men crying out) (dramatic music) Hold it right there Schuster. - Hold it, whoa. I got important news Sheriff. No need gettin' edgy. - What are you doin' around here? - Lookin' for you. Ah, you might as well put the gun down, me and the boys got no quarrel with you. - Well what do you expect a man to do when you come up at him like that? - Right now, I got somethin' important to tell ya. It's Frank Woods, my son Clint here seen him. - That's right Sheriff, we know where he is and we aim to have that reward. - Frank's in Mexico, he hasn't been back here since the shooting. You must have seen somebody else. - Clint don't lie, that was him. - No mistake Sheriff, it's Woods. Tell 'im Clint. - I was up the river, about a half a mile in the tall reeds, chasin' down a stray calf. And that's when I seen him come across the river. Tall in the saddle, big black hat. He had a beard, I knew it was him all right. - We aim to get that reward. - Why don't you and your boys just go get him yourself? - 'Cause we ain't no fast guns, and you know it. We ain't crazy either. Now, we'll take you to where he's holed up and we'll back ya. - Yeah, well you won't have to. Just tell me where you think you saw Frank. I'll do the rest. - Oh no ya don't Sheriff. We aim to go along and make sure you do your duty. I could work my whole life and never get to see five thousand dollars. (crickets chirping) (slow guitar music) - You two stay here, and keep those horses quiet. You others, come with me. - Shuster and I are gonna go around the back and watch the horse. You three hit the front door. (guitar music) (laughing) - They sure have been in there a long time. - Yep, they sure have. (strumming guitar music) (gun shots) (screaming) - I'd sure hate to shoot a friend John. - Oh Frank. What a surprise, we didn't expect you to show up here. - Both of you will be a whole lot safer without those guns. Get down. (smacking) (crying) - There are seven of us Frank, you can't get away this time. Why don't you turn over that gun to me. I'll see that you get a fair trial. Most you're gonna get is a few years. - I don't like fences, and I don't trust the law. - Every bounty hunter in the country is out to skin you for the reward. How long do you think you can last out there? I'm giving you a chance to come in alive. - No thanks John. - You're not gonna make it. - I'm gonna try. (suspenseful music) (gun shots) - Looks like they got him. (laughing) (lively music) - [Man On Watch] Shoot 'im pa. (gun shots) (horses galloping) (lively music) (gun shots) (lively music) (gun shots) ♫ Frank Woods you are the wanted man ♫ And no doubt about it ♫ Had the fastest gun in the land ♫ Runnin' and bein' chased ♫ And needin' to hide a trail in smoke ♫ But the biggest challenge you ever had ♫ Was when you came to a town called Hope ♫ Frank Woods you are the wanted man ♫ With your silver barrel pearl handled gun in your hand ♫ Oh the late October morning ♫ You ride in to that town ♫ Frank Woods when you gonna lay it all down - You know Matt, I never did see Frank Woods fight I, I seen the kid though, oh it was terrible. - Jim Stockey seen 'em all. Says Woods shot down three men in Laredo and didn't crack a wrinkle on his face. - I saw seven or eight of these dresses on lovely ladies walkin' there in Kansas City. - [Man At Table] Well Woods, what's the matter with you Matt ain't ya listening? - Oh your teeth are clackin' so bad I can't understand ya. - Mrs. Fromm, when you buy this dress and walk in to that new church we're gonna build, heads will swivel around, just like a swingin' gate. - I don't think so. - Oh Mrs. Fromm, this here dress is in the Sears and Roebuck book. Just let me show ya. - I don't care the angel Gabriel came down and announced personally it's the proper style. I wouldn't wear it. - Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir. - It's him. He came like a light shinin' under the swamp to being us comfort, welcome Parson. Jeremiah Leech, I sent ya the letter askin' ya to come. I'm Erica Fromm, welcome to town. - Welcome Parson. I'm Matthew Dooley, Sheriff of Hope. - Welcome Parson, I'm Joe Cogin, this here is Slim Newsom, we take care of the stable. - I do the most work though, howdy Parson. - They're just a bit sour Parson, too long away from God's house. Joe, will you get the Parson's horse and put him in the stable? And Slim, you help him. Go on, shoo. - Why is it that women always take over religion? - Well my dear-- - Oh they'll take care of it. I got your letter, we've been lookin' for ya days back. Did you have a pleasant journey? - Ma'am? - I asked if ya had a pleasant journey. - You must be drier than a devil's doughnut. How about a drink? - Mr. Blacker, Mr. Leech is a man a God, cold sarsaparilla will do fine. - Well, as long as it's a drinkin' occasion I'll have some whiskey. Well, as long as it's a Parson's occasion, I'll have some of that. - Well Mr. Leech, here's to our new man of God. May he last longer than the others. - There, that's better. We got your house all ready. - House? - Yes, we thought you'd get here before we could get it finished. But everybody pitched in so you'd be comfortable the minute you arrived. - That's right, Slim and Joe painted it, with paint that Mrs. Fromm had me donate. - Jennifer, that's my sister. Jennifer sewed the bedspread and the curtains. Took her the best part of a month. - Miss Jennifer. - Uh, I was hopin' that you'd devote some time to Jennifer, I know your teachin's would be inspirational. But I'm sorry for carryin' on so Parson. I imagine you'll wanna bathe and see your house now. - Yes. - I knew there was somethin' I forgot. Soap, now this here is from back East. Bay Rum, it's on the house Parson. Anything else you need, just ask. - Now, sister and I are gonna show you up to your house. Now, when you come to supper tonight, you can fill us in on your trip. - So long, Parson, pleasure meetin' ya. - Kinda quiet, ain't he? - Yeah, I guess he's savin' it up for the Sunday sermon. What is this sass stuff. Why that'd take the warts off of a toady frog. Now, give me a drink. - Well, this'll do nicely, ma'am. - Excuse me, the bath's all ready. (giggles) - Uh, better let me have that coat, and I'll clean it for you. - Oh no, that's all right, ma'am. Why don't you just let me uh, hand it out to you. - Oh of course, oh I'm sorry, Parson. (giggles) - Phew, talk about pride of Kansas, on with you, Parson. - [Parson] Oh? - Better let me have the pants too. I'll get 'em all clean before supper. (giggles) Shirt too. (giggles) - Jim Starkey. - Whoa. - You old son of gun. What brings you into town? - [Jim] Ah, whisky and tobaccy. Too old for anything else. (giggles) - Have a nice bath, Parson. I'll send Joe back with these, and we'll see you at the house about seven. - Uh, yes ma'am, about seven o'clock. (laughs) (sighs) - Oh, feels good. (harmonica music) - Woo, would you look at the bustle on that Jenny. - [Slim] That's Jennifer Frome. - Woo, ain't she somethin'. (laughs) - [Slim] Let me give you a hand down, Jim. - Thank you, Slim. You know, now I'll always know why Jamie's always in a heap when he's talkin' about her. (cackles) And they're comin' from the preacher man's house. He here? - Yeah, just come in today. You know, he don't look like a preacher. But then, who's to say? Probably belchin' fire when he's sermonizin'. - Well, I think I'll sneak up 'ere and get me a look. - Oh, I-I wouldn't if I was you, Jim. Misses Frome has done took him over special. So is Jennifer. You might tell Jamie he's got some real competition now. - Ain't nobody gonna be competition for Jamie, and with a preacher man in town he could tie the not. He'll have him out of here before he knows it. - Enough gossipin', supper's on. - Parson, would you take the end of the table? You're our guest of honor. Jennifer'll sit to your left, and Jesse across from the Parson. Hope you're hungry. - Oh, yes ma'am, I could eat a bear. (laughs) (clears throat) - Where there's good food and good meat uh, Lord bid ya take your fork and eat, amen. - You seem a hardy man, Parson. Not like any preacher man I ever met. - Well, like all of God's creatures, got my own way of doin' things, Jesse. Livin's hard out here in the West. I guess I'm just cured a bit harder than most. - Tell us about your other church, Preacher. - Well, Misses Frome, for a long time the roof of my church has been God's big sky. Lord's bid me take the message to the lamb. That's what I did. - Uh, pass me the potatoes please, Jenny. - Everything you've done sounds so interesting, including your trip to Hope. - Definitely, yep, definitely interesting. - Would you like some more coffee? - Mm, don't mind if I do, Miss Jennifer. (gunfire) (whooping) - No need to worry, Parson. It's Saturday night. A bunch of saddle bums come into town to let off steam. - Steam? Why, it's not safe for a body to go out at all. Well, I declare, Jesse, steam. What if Jennifer was to go out? - Erica, let's not upset supper. - Well, you got a sheriff here, he'll take care of things. - Matthew Dooley? Why, he's gone, Parson. He leaves every Saturday and comes home Sunday night. If he can find his way. - Erica, now you stop right there. - The parson's gotta know the truth sooner or later. There's no law here. There's nothing but a bunch of saddle bums and broken sherrifs and that harlet, Judy. Do you know what they did to our last preacher? They tarred and feathered him, that's what. And him, a man of God. - I guess all towns are wide open while they're just growin', with flooseys and drunks and everybody rasin' heck. It's all right for them, but we don't want that to happen here. We got women and children that need a safe place to live. We need a church and a minister that'll pull people together, Mister Leach. We need a strong man like you to put the fear of God into 'em. - How 'bout a piece of that pie, Miss Jennifer. - I made it myself. - You're a hell of a woman, Miss Jenny. Make someone a fine wife someday. - Our main problem is Matt Dooley was picked by the circuit judge to be sheriff. When we get a church goin', and you help us pull the people together into an organization, we're gonna send for a new sheriff and get ourselves a town charter. - Mm. - We're almost wrote up now. All we need is that little extra ounce to make us the peace we need. - A hell of a meal, Miss Frome. - We need you to help with the organizing, like we write in the letter. - Erica. I think the Parson would just like to enjoy dinner and relax from his trip. He's probably wore out. - Would you like to set out on the porch? You could read us a verse from the Bible. We like to read the Bible after a meal. - Oh no, that's uh, mighty hospitable of ya, but to tell you the truth, I'm plum tuckered out. And if you don't mind, I'll just go on home and get some sleep. I'll see you Sunday. - [Jenny] Goodnight, Parson. - [Parson] Goodnight, Miss Jennifer. (band music) (saloon music) (grunts) (whooping) (fist smacks) (grunts) (laughing) (shouting) (suspenseful music) (whooping in distance) - [Man] Hey Jamie, it's your turn! (laughing) ♫ Oh do you remember (mumbles) (choking) - Hey, Jamie. - Well, Frank, looks like Hope needs you. Good thing you went to Sunday school and learned all them prayers. (laughs) looks like they ain't gonna let ya leave. - [Man] Hey Blacker, hey get some girls out here, will ya! - And I remember all of those prayers you taught me too, dad. The Lord is my shepherd, he leadeth me beside still waters. (cackles) - Well, let's get him on his horse. - But you know what comforts my soul dad, huh? The sword of Damocles. - Let's put him up in the wagon, let him sleep it off. - Yeah, that's a good idea, Les. (coughs) (laughs) (sighs) (rooster crows) - [Joe] Hey, Parson, ya up yet? It's me, Joe. - Yeah, what is it, Joe? - [Joe] Well, they're waitin'. - Waitin', waiting or what? - The folks, they're waitin' for you. - For me? - Yeah, Sunday mornin', they're waitin' for you to speak and groundbreaking excercises for the new church. - Oh, sure, well, hold on a minute. I'll be right with you, Joe. (sighs) (humming) - Oh heh, sorry to disturb ya, Parson. I bet you're tired from your trip. Sure look tired, all right. (laughs) Ah, folks is anxious to get started on the church. That's why we're having this there ground breaking today. Yep, (sighs) ah, sure need a church in this town. Need it bad. Them drovers is gettin' worse all the time. Why Jamie, th-that-that's Jim uh, Jim Starkey's boy, he got himself all clobbered up last night. Woke up in a wagon with a knot on his head a big as a good egg. (laughs) Ah, you shoulda seen what he done to Blackard's place when he come to. He thought he was Frank Woods, all right, sure. (laughs) You know, old Jim, Jim's got Jamie all head up about Frank Woods and how he gunned down three men at one time. Now he thinks he can do it. He hasn't done it yet, though. One of these days, Jamie, he's gonna shoot up somebody here, and nobody in Hope'll try him though. - Hello, mornin', Parson. (band music) - Parson, I'd like you to meet some of the folks of Hope. This here is Jake Halstrom. He's got the farm up the road from me. - [Jake] Good to meet you, Parson. - Misses Halstrom, and their sons Rick and Michael. And back here is Hap Johnson and Misses Johnson. - Proud to make your acquantance. - Their daughter, Karen, and the little one over here, Todd. - Howdy, Todd. - And this is Rick and Misses Lathrop. Of course, you know Mister Blackard. - Howdy, Howard. - [Howard] Parson. - We'd uh, deem it an honor, Parson, if you'd break the first ground for the first house of God in Hope. We dedicate our lives to following the words of Jesus Christ. Please lead us, Parson. - Uh Jessie, you don't know what you're doin' to me. Of course I'd be more than happy to break this hallowed ground for you folks, but I think the, the person that should break this virgin soil is the lady that made this all possible, Misses Erica. (laughs) (group applauds) - I'm donating $500 to get it started. - 200, 200, I'll-I'll put in 200, and I'll donate glass for the windows. - Put it in here, folks. Give us money to start this church. And I donate another $500, Parson, on the cash off my new crop which will be in two weeks. That makes over $1200 to start the church. - Oh. (group applauds) - I am truly, truly, overwhelmed. I had not expected to see this much money for some time. - I'll store it in my vault for safe keepin', Parson. - No, Howard, this is the Lords money, and the Lord will show me how to take care of it, Amen. And you'll have a, another $500 in two weeks, Jessie. - That's right, Parson. - Fine. Misses Frome, for God sakes, break this soil. (laughs) Why he's, he's a watchin'. He's sittin' up there watchin', God is. Lord only knows how this union came about and the walls of the temples of sin did crumble and his house, it rise, shinin' outta that dust. (group applauds) (laughs) ♫ Onward Christian soldiers (singing in distance) - See that? Be warned. Closed for Sunday. Why, that's the way it always begins. (yawns) - Kinda early to be drinkin', Jamie. - Why, why don't you just go up there (stammers) and join 'em, join the song singers, go on. (scoffs) Oh, go on! - No, (sighs) I... ♫ Onward Christian soldiers ♫ Marching as to war ♫ With the cross of Jesus ♫ Going on before - They get that Church goin' Sundays, and-and there's not gonna be no more liquor on Sundays, and-and you know what else they're gonna do, huh? - Huh, what? - They're gonna build a jail. - What'd they wanna build a jail for? (laughs) ♫ Onward Christian solders (applause) - It was wonderful having ya all here. - Come on, let's go up there and shoot a few of them, Jamie. That'll teach 'em, huh, huh? - It'll be all over, they get that church built. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye bye - Bye. - Parson, that was a great sermon, thank you. - Thank you. - No noise. - Huh? - Throw 'em everywhere. (giggling) - Shh, let's sneak out the front. - Go, go, go, go. - It was so good to hear the men sigin' again, Parson. - You have a big voice, Parson. - I could hear that sweet voice of yours ringin' out above the crowd, Miss Jennifer. - Maybe we should ask about it now. - Oh, the Parson's probably tired. - [Parson] Ask me what? - It's a most difficult problem, Parson. It's uh, Jennifer. You see, Jennnifer ain't Erica's sister. She's our daughter. See, when we first come out here, there was no preacher, so Erica and I were married in the old way. You know, we traded rings. - So, we moved here to hope and just told everybody she was our baby sister. But now there's a problem. - You wanna get church married. - No, the preacher that was here before did that for us before he left. - He left before we could get Jennifer baptized. - I understand. Is there a river or lake near here? - Oh sure, there's a river a mile outta town. - Ah, any man that's gonna donate $500 to do God's work, deserves somethin' for himself. Why, we could take Miss Jennifer down there right now if you want. - Oh, God bless you, Parson. - I can't tell you how much we appreciate it, Parson. - It would be my extreme pleasure. - What on Earth is he doin', man? What? I don't know. - Come on. - Huh? - I think we gonna follow 'em, hm? What'd you think? (laughs) yeah, I just uh, I don't know. - Let's go. (thunder rumbles) (band music) - What the hell are they doin'? Looks like he tryin' to drown her. - [Jamie] It's a baptism. - A what? - Well, it's-it's a baptism. - I baptise thee, Jennifer Susan Frome, in the name of God. ♫ Shall we gather at the river God bless this child of Jessie and Erica. ♫ With it's crystal tide forever ♫ Flowing by the throne of God Amen. - You mean to tell me he drug her all the way out here to the country just to throw her in the water. (sighs) Well, that, - We'll go over to that river road and say hello. Come on. (gunshot) - [Parson] Easy, easy. - Whoa! Jamie, you ought'nta stop in the middle of the road like that, you could get hurt. - Howdy, Mister Frome, Misses Frome , Miss Jennifer. - What do you want, Jamie? - Well we, we wanna meet uh, the new preacher man. Ain't that right, Ace? - Yeah. - Well, you shoulda come to services this mornin'. He was there to serve all a ya. - Crazy thing, ol', ol' Ace here, he uh, he gets stomach gall every time he takes in them there services. Besides, uh, he's a funny lookin' dude. - Get rid of him Jesse. - Move your horses so's we can pass, Jamie and Ace. - You shut your mouth, old man. - Easy now, that ain't hospitable. They're our friends. Ol' Ace here, he's all wriled up 'cause the store was closed. I mean that was, wasn't it, mm-hm. And uh, well I mean he, he musta slept on a bur last night. Why are you such a queer lookin' preacher man, hm? - Well now, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. (laughs) Unless you happen to be looking in the mirror. - Wh-What-What's that mean, hm? - I don't know, why don't you let me pull him down there and bash his head in. - Jamie Starkey, would you tell your bucket headed brother to leave us alone? - Miss Jenny, uh, oh Ace ain't gonna do nothin' to him, he's just funnin' with him, that's all. Huh, we-we-we just wanna see what we got ourselves for a new preacher man, that's all. (laughs) - You know what we did to the last preacher dude? - Whoa, that is. - You're so big and strong, Jamie, you'd hold women and children against their will. - Well, I thought there was uh, two men here, but uh, I guess there ain't. - Well now, seems like if there was two men here, they'd be able to see that miss Jennifer was cold and wet. But I suppose you'd like to see her catch her death of consumption. - Uh, I'm not decided on this Jenny. I-I-I mean I'm not, I'm sorry. I wouldn't want anything to happen to ya. I wouldn't want that. All right, move out of the ways. - [Jesse] Daisey, Lady, Let's go, get up! Thank you very much, Parson. - [Parson] You bet, thank you. (dog barks) (blue grass music) (whooping) (shouting) - Hey, preacher man, the sky's a fallin'! Hey Preacher, you better run! We're not gonna let you stay! Woo. (whooping) (mumbling) - [Howard] Oh, hey Jamie, howdy. - Get us a bottle, Blacker. - Hey Howard, you shoulda seen what me and Jamie just done. We just scared preacher man. - We don't have to worry about that dude, (incoherent shouting) (laughs) - Yeah. - yeah. - You shouldn't a done that, Jamie. He's a nice enough feller. - You-You shut your mouth, Joe. (laughs) - Yeah. - Yeah. - We own this town here. And-and I, and I say there ain't gonna be no religion here. - You shoulda seen that preacher man. Oh, I bet he dirt in his pants when he seen these in his house. (laughs) - Stopped them out there on that little road, and hadn't been for his lady friends I, (mumbles) (laughs) - You couldn't whip a baby, little drip. - One of these days, Rance, you're gonna fun with me to far. - Well, if you stop shootin' your mouth off, maybe I'll quit. - Stand up. I'm gonna shut your mouth for ya. (laughs) Stand up! (suspenseful music) - Now, now, look, Jamie, don't do nothin' foolish. Rance is your friend, he's only funnin' ya. - You sit down, fat man. You open your mouth again, I'm gonna blow your head off. Down boy. That's it. - Go on, kill him, Jamie. - Shut up, Ace Rance, you gonna eat them words, now take 'em back for me. - I ain't gonna draw at you, Jamie. So, I'll take the words back. But you just remember one thing. I want that preacher outta town just as bad as you do. - Well, hey, looky who's comin'. - Oh, appears he ain't dirtied up his pants._ (laughs) - Hey, hey, Preacher? - Didn't you get the message about the sky fallin' in on ya? (laughs) - I needed a few things for my trip. (laughs) - Parson's leavin' town, Jamie. He really is. - Just-Just to show ya that-that-that we ain't all bad, I'm gonna buy a drink for the trip. - Buy one for preacher man. - [Howard] Jamie, uh-uh, Jamie, the parson don't drink. - Oh, he does now, Howard, whisky. (laughs) We're gonna drink and see it before he goes. (laughs) I sure am glad I saw you before you left, Preacher. You don't know how good that makes me feel. (laughs) Whiskey there, Howard. Well, Preacher, here's to your trip. (laughs) Well, I-I, I can't stand waistin' uh, good money or goo liquor, (stammers) makes me mad. (laughs) - Oh yeah! - Does it make you mad? - You bet. - Does, does it make you mad, Howard. - Well, well it, it is awful good liquor. (laughs) - Well, it makes me mad, makes me real mad. (sighs) (laughs) Makes Ace mad. - Ooh. (laughs) - Well, does that mean that you uh, done gone and sinned there uh, Preacher, huh? I mean enough to go to Hell! - If you have, we'll all be there soon enough to meet ya. - I think I got it. I'll pour you a real big one, Preacher. (laughs) This is on the house, Preacher. - Oh. - Oh no. (laughs) - Hey, right here. - Oh, that's great. - I think he's really sinnin' now. Oh, yeah. (laughs) (shouting) (laughing) (cheering) - He can drink for a preacher. That ain't sinnin', Ace. Now, I'll tell you what real sinnin' would be. What real sinnin' would be if uh, Preacher and Judy was to get together! Now that would be real sin! (laughs) - Oh, Jamie! (whooping) - Judy and the Preacher? (laughs) I'd give anything to see that. - Hell, I might pay five dollars to see that myself. - Five dollars, five dollars? A preacher. (giggles) Preacher's gonna cost you twenty dollars. Twenty dollars! (laughs) - Well, I got me five. Give me your five. - Who put up the rest, there. - I've got five, I've got five dollars, I want in on this. (bar chattering) (laughing) - Come on, Preacher. Come on, let's go uh, go over to my place. - Let's all go! (laughs) - Let 'em do it right here! - I got five dollars in this, I wanna watch. - Hey, hey we can pull a couple of tables together, and they could do it right there! - What are you waitin' for, boys! Let's get the preacher's clothes off! (shouting) (incoherent shouting) (suspenseful music) (laughs) - You gotta be punished. - Let me at him, little brother. - [Howard] Watch out for those tables! (grunts) (screams) - Jamie, Jamie, that's enough! - Jamie, Jamie, fightin' is one thing, but murder is somethin' else! (suspenseful music) - I'm sorry Preacher, I guess the sky's gonna fall down on you. I see you within 50 miles of Hope, I'm gonna give you. (laughs) Take this sinner outta here! Come on! - Watch those tables! Come on! (dramatic music) (laughing) - [Ace] Tables ain't seen that much action in a long time. (peaceful music) - This is sweet tea and liquor. Jesse said it would give you strength. Better lay still. Jesse and Ma went over to the Halston's to get ready for haulin'. They'll be back in a little while. - What's a matter, Miss Jennifer. - I can't stand to see you hurt. I could kill those animals for what they did to you. - Ah, I'll be all right. Fix me some more of that. Maybe put some whisky in that, seems to be helpin'. - Don't touch those, Parson, it'll get infected. Do you think you ought to be sittin' up? (laughs) - You're more worrysome than your ma. (coughs) She fixes a hell of a cup of tea. (sighs) How did I get here. - Um, Slim found you in the street. Then he came and got Jesse, and they brought you here in the buckboard. I overheard what they done to you. - I'm just a little bit hurt on the outside. Nobody can touch me inside. - Oh, I wish I was a strong as you. It hurts me just to think about it. - Why, you've got more strength and wisdom than, than you realize. Why, you're a woman, Miss Jennifer. - I do? I, I am? - Oh, just think of the way you're takin' care of me. - But it pleasure's me to take care of you. (peaceful music) You better lay back. (sawing) - Seems like there's a romance brewing, Misses Frome. - I can't think of a nicer thing to happen to Jennifer. Parson's wife. (clears throat) - We came to apologize for what happened to ya, Parson. - Jesse and me, we went to all the folks in town, and Rance gave me his solemn promise that he wouldn't start any more trouble. The only problem we can't do nothin' about right now is Jamie, Jim Stary's boy. Jim's so old he can't handle his kids any longer. They're wild. We're hopin' that with our men taking care of their boys, Jamie'll find himself all alone. Maybe he won't start anything. It uh, might help you'd stay off the street on Saturday nights for a while, 'til we uh, get ourselves another sheriff. - And just to show you our good faith, we've taken up a little collection. $200 for the church fund. - Well, I'm feelin' better by the minute. - Ha-Ha, that's good, Parson. Can I get you something to eat to keep your strength up? - Why, no thank you, gentlemen. I'm not hungry, I think I'll just sit here in the sunshine for a whle. (laughs) - Um, I'll be goin' into Mayfield tomorrow with a load of beets. Only be gone a couple days, a week at the most. I'll bring back that $500 I promised to the church. And uh, I might bring back some other good news. We got up a petition, everybody signed it. A petition for a sheriff. I'm takin' that in to the federal marshal in Mayfield. May take a few weeks to get him here, but it's worth the wait, right, Parson? - We can wait. - I was thinkin', Erika would like to see the city again. If it'd be alright with you, we'd like to leave Jennifer in your care. (laughs) Maybe she could look out for you. If you need anything, Joe and Slim could help out. - Well, I'll watch here like a hawk does his prey, Jesse. - That takes the whole parcel of weight off my mind. Now, I'm gonna get me some of that barbecued beef. You take good care of him, Jennifer. - I surely will, Jesse. - Jennifer! Jennifer, what are you doin'? We're leavin'. Aren't you at least gonna say goodbye. - I'm sorry mother, I didn't know you were ready to go yet. I'm just done packing your basket. - We'll be back on Sunday. You take good care of the parson. - I will. - You uh, be careful Parson. - I will. - We'll see ya Sunday or Saturday, late. (clicks tongue) Come, let's go. - Bye. - Bye-Bye. - Goodbye. - [Jesse] Easy now, easy.

(laughs) - [Rance] I'm in - There's mine. - Nice little town you got here. - Yeah, it's goin'. - Saw a church goin' up on the road in. That's a sign the town's growin'. (ominous music) - We playin' cards or we listening to a damn sermon? Now, this is a saloon, not a damn church. I gettin' tire of hearin' this. - Oh, calm down, Jamie, we're playin'. The man's just talkin', he ain't doin' no harm. - Come on, sit down Jamie. He didn't mean nothin' by it. - I don't wanna hear about none of that damn religion. It's all a bunch a. When we was in Kansas before mom died we went to Sunday school. And there was this preacher there, why he was the dumbest dude I'd ever seen. One day our pa caught Ace. (laughing) - Jamie. - And-and he took him to this preacher to get saved. (laughs) you know what the preacher told him? (laughs) It'd make him crazy. (laughs) Well, I ain't crazy. (laughs) I've gone crazy. - Come on Jamie, deal the cards. - Brance, you got no sense of humor. - I'd like to buy everybody a drink. - Well, I think I could use one. - [Howard] Yes sir, yes sir, comin' right up here, mister. There you are. - Sudden death, and Jamie's the deal. (laughs) - [Howard] Thank you kindly. - Here we go boys, down and dirty. - Right here. Thank you. - There's a little hidden treasure for Ace. There's one for Rance. Rance is all ready worried about Ace, aren't ya Rancey? - I wanna see the money right there. (laughs) Let's rig it up. - Well, looks like better dueces bet over there, Slim. - Bet two dollars draggin' three change. - I just think I'll eat it up with Chester and go in a couple more. - I'll buy that. - You really got somethin', Jamies, or you just blowin' wind as usual? - Well, all you gotta do is put your money in the center of that old table and find out there uh, preacher lover. - I fold. (laughs) - [Jamie] I knew you'd go out on that. I knew it. - [Jamie] Everybody's in, except for Rancy. Read 'em and weep. No help here for Ace. And stranger strangers sittin' with a pair of sevens. - I told you to bring me the money, but you keep drinking. - [Jamie] Pair of sevens bet. - [Gambler] Five dollars. - Well, all right, I'll stay for one more card. - I'm out. - [Rance] Turn your cards over. - Five dollars. I'll just go in five, and I'll raise ya five. - [Rance] Well, Ace. - I fold. - Figures. - I'll call ya. - That's too rich for an old boy like me. - Well, I guess it's just you and me. (ominous music) - Deal. (sighs) - Last card. That ain't no help. That's the top for Jamie. You're bet due. How much you wanna lose? (laughs) - Twenty dollars. - Twenty dollars. Well, I guess to win everything, you gotta bet everything. There's you, and there's me. Up twenty. - I'll call ya. Let's see what you got. - You call me? - That means you gotta turn that card up. - Go on, do it Jamie. - It's okay, Ace. Seven's huh? - Mm-Hm. (laughs) I got three set. - [Rance] Oh, man. - That was nice though. It's good. - You just had a lesson in poker playing, James. - Boy that's mighty hot, yes it is. - Another drink out of that jug. - Wait a minute here, how'd you get three sevens? Something's funny here. - You dealt the cards. - I think he cheated me. - No Jaime. - How could he have cheated you. You dealt. - I don't know how he did it, but he did it. He cheated me. - Man don't play with God don't play with nothing. - Just let the money lay there on the table, stranger. - What? - I said you just let the money lay there on the table, and get out of town. That's what I said. (gunshot) - He's dead. - He reached for it. It was self defense. I saw him draw first. (yells) - You sure is bad. All fire and lightning, Jamie. I ain't never seen nothing like that. (sawing) - Hey folks, I got a toast. Here's to Jaime Starking, only gunfire the town of Hope has ever seen. (laughter) (knock on door) - Who's there? - [Jennifer] Jennifer. - Just a minute, honey. What are you doing here? - I just had to see you. I was glad you came back. - I bet you're faster than Frank Woods. - Frank Woods? He ain't that fast. Oh, Jimmy was faster than that card player, but Frank Woods? He's something else again. - One of these days, Ranch, you can't push me too far, or I'll be running you out of this town. You're nothing but a preacher lover. - Who's a preacher lover? Listen, I'd just soon run that preacher out of town as you, but I promised Mister Holt. - That's what I said. - Okay, I'll show you. I'll show you. Come on. (dramatic music) (gunfire and glass shattering) - What was that? - Shh. (gunfire) - Hey Parson, come out here. I want to tell you something. (incoherent shouting) There ain't no God. Hey God, if you're up there, strike me dead. I told you there ain't no God. There ain't no God. (laughs) - You tell him, Tex. That's right, you tell him. - Hey, you oughtn't say things like that. - Why? God gonna punish me? Hey God, if you're up there, strike me dead. (yells) - What happened? - It's a heart attack. (funeral dirge) - Behold, cometh the lamb of God. He who lives with those who cast stones against his neighbors will indeed be struck in turn. No man wishes to live by violence, but if he does, then his life will surely end in violence. We grieve for this cowboy, for he had no chance to learn another way, and those who blocked his vision of God should pay heed to this lesson and watch as he is buried. Oh Lord, we pray that you'll take this sinner into your loving arms and forgive him. Amen. Bury him. - Maybe Pa's right, Jaime. Rands asked God to strike him down, and God just did it. (laughs) - What about Tex, huh? He said the same thing, and nothing happened to him. - Maybe Tex repented. Pa says if you repent, really, maybe it ain't too late to save your soul. - Hey, ain't that Tex's horse? - Yeah. - Come on. Hey Tex? Hey Tex? Hey Tex. - He comes down here all the time. (dramatic music) Yo tex. - He wouldn't go off and leave his horse alone. - Hey Tex. Wonder where he could be. Tex! - Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath, for it is written vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayeth the Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him. If he thirst, give him drink, for in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. I didn't know this cowboy, just well enough to know he lived a hard and wild life, as he was a sinner, and he's paid for those sins today. Lord, we hope you'll take him into your loving grace. Amen, bury him. (cries) (horses gallop) - Just terrible, all these accidents. - They got what they deserved. - What a thing to say. - Well, I only meant he who lives by the sword shall die by it. That's in the Bible. - I guess you're right, you always are. - Jessie's due back today, and I think it would be best if you were there when he got in. As soon as they get here, I want you to tell him I'd like to see him right away. - Parson gave a real nice sermon. - I like that part where he says ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. - Soon as we get that new church built, I want you and me to be the first to tie the knot in it, but until then, it's just our little secret. - Ours and the Lord. I love you, Jeremiah. - You run along home, dear. - Ever since that preacher got into this town, nothing but trouble. Never did before. Just a little fighting and drinking, that's all. Now look at this place. Everybody's chin hanging right down to their belts. - We had a funeral, Jamie. Just trying to be respectable. - Hey Judy, let's liven this place up, huh? Come on over here and sing us a song. Come on, hey. - I don't feel like it, Jaime. (laughs) - You don't feel like it? You get over here. - Now you leave her alone, Jaime. She ain't done nothing to you. Now just let her be. - You're looking for a bullet, Matt, huh? You ain't no sheriff. You ain't nothing but a fat, drunken slob. - Ain't no call for talk like that. - There ain't, huh? Why don't you just reach for your gun? Go on, I'll give you a chance. - I never claimed to be no fast gun. - [Jamie] Fact of it is you ain't nothing. What was we supposed to do here if we need you to defend us? Go looking for you under some rock? I don't like the way you've been doing the job here. I don't want you to be sheriff no more, so why don't you just take your badge off, and lay it right over there on the bar. - I can't do that, Jaime. The judge chose me. - To be killed by a cowboy? You're either gonna take that badge off, or draw for your gun. You want to be a living citizen, or dead lawman? I'm gonna count to three. One. That's two. - Wait. All right, Jaime. I'm retired. - Now who wants to be sheriff of Hope? Job's open. Nobody wants it? I guess I'll just have to take it myself. Raise your right hand, Jaime Starkey. Yes sir? Do you swear to be the law? Yes sir. Do you swear to drink a lot, have fun, and raise Hell? Yes sir. Do you swear? I do, I do. What about religion? (stammers) what about religion? (stammers) what about religion? I'll tell you about religion. (knocks on door) I'm the sheriff here now, and I'm making a law. I'm making it illegal to have religion in this here town. - Jessie. - Jennifer said you wanted to see me. - I hate to bring you out like this, but there's the Lord's work to be done, and it can't wait. - My first duty as sheriff. - Did you bring the money? - Yep, here it is, $500. - Is to run that no-account preacher out of this town once and for all. - God be with you. - Thank you, parson. Good afternoon. - Good bye, Jessie. - Is that right brother? (cheers) Is that right brother? (cheers) Is that right brother? (cheers) All right, here we go. (dramatic music) - Frank, you did all right this time. - Let's ride right on over there, and drag him all the way down that street. Come on. Come on, let's ride over there and drag that preacher right on down that road. (incoherent yelling) Hey preacher, come on out here boy. (gunshot) - Don't kill the parson! Come on Jaime. (gunshots) Leave him alone, Jaime. (incoherent yelling) - Afternoon Jaime, Ace. You wanted to see me? - I surely do. You see, I'm the new sheriff hereabouts, and I just passed a new law that says it's illegal to have church here and a preacher in this here town. I'm tired of seeing your ugly face around here. We're gonna send you off a packin', and drag you right on down that street. (laughter) Go get the rope, Ace. - I wouldn't do that if I was you, Ace. - Go on Ace do what I tell you, go on, get the rope. - I don't know, Jaime. I don't like messing with God. - I said go on and get that rope right away. Come on, get over there. (laughter) (gunshots) (screams) - Well now, Jaime, looks like it's just you and me. That's the way you wanted it, ain't it kid? Sheriff? - I ain't no sheriff. Matt's the sheriff. - Well now that's all right, Jaime, 'cause I ain't no preacher. Gun's empty, boy. Why don't you just load it up? - I don't want to draw on you. - Pick it up, Jaime. (gunshot) (screams) What's the matter, Jaime? Can't you take it, boy? You can sure dish it out. You just load that gun up there, boy. I'll wait for you. You can even use some of my own bullets. - Don't kill me. Don't kill me. (cries) - Load it up, Jaime. Hurry up, boy, I'm waiting. (dramatic music) - Don't want to hurt nobody. I can't draw and shoot. Can't you see I'm hurt? - [Frank] Hurry up, Jaime. - I can't. I'm hurt. I promise I'll never bother you again, I promise. I promise you. - Holster that gun, Jaime. - I can't draw against you. I got my hands up. What about God? What about God? - God helps them that help themselves, Jaime. - Oh God, leave me alone. I believe. I believe. God, don't let him kill me. Don't kill me. Please somebody help me. Help me, please. - All right, Jaime boy. I won't hurt you. You just give me the gun. Give me the gun, boy. - You son-- (gunshot) (screams) - ♫ Oh sinner man, ♫ Now they know just who you really are. ♫ It's all over now, ♫ And the fast guns will come here from near and far. ♫ You take your reputation ♫ And your farewell sermon, ♫ You say goodbye and let them find their own way. - I didn't want it to end this way, but you can go ahead and build your church. I left the money in the house. Goodbye, Jennifer. - ♫ Don't be fooled by feeling ♫ There is no need for seeing. ♫ Tomorrow is just another passing day. (birds chirping) - I see you got my letter, John. - I'm glad to see that you decided to do it this way, Frank. - I run out of places to hide, and I'd like to get this over with. (upbeat music) - ♫ Come now, sit beside me if you want to. ♫ Share my bread and cheese and taste my wine. ♫ We will laugh and talk and reminisce about our yesterdays ♫ And it's all right to want me, if you're so inclined. ♫ Come on, walk beside me if you want to. ♫ Let our rambling footsteps entwine. ♫ You don't even have to go confess it to your mama. ♫ It's all right to meet me if you're so inclined. ♫ We won't even think about tomorrow. ♫ It's enough to simply try to talk and play today, ♫ And understand the pleasure, pain, and sorrow ♫ That brought us here together and makes me want to say ♫ Darling, come and lay beside me if you want to, ♫ Press your hungry body close to mine, ♫ And if you let me touch you, ♫ we will come to know each other, ♫ And it's all right to love me if you're so inclined. ♫ We won't even think about tomorrow. ♫ It's enough to simply try to contemplate today, ♫ And understand the pleasure, pain, and sorrow ♫ That brought us here together and makes me want to say ♫ Baby, come and lay beside me if you want to. ♫ Press your hungry body close to mine. ♫ If you let me touch you, we will come to know each other, ♫ And it's all right to want me, ♫ It's all right to need me, ♫ It's all right to touch me, ♫ It's all right to love me, ♫ It's all right to want me, ♫ It's all right to need me, ♫ it's all right to touch me, ♫ It's all right to love me...
