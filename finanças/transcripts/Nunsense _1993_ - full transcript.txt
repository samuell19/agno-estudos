(light gentle music) (birds chirping) (bell ringing) - [Everyone] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. - Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. - [Everyone] Amen. (light perky music) (suspenseful music) (utensils clanking) (nun screaming) (people chattering) - How are you? - [Older Gentleman] Good. - Hello, welcome. Welcome to Mount Saint Helen's. Good to see everyone. - This is so exciting. - [Hubert] Hope you're gonna enjoy the show. - Oh, oh, listen, Reverend Mother is right behind me and I was hoping that you could all help out. Put her in a good mood, because believe me, there's nothing worse than a crabby Reverend Mother! You know what I mean? (audience laughing) So how 'bout this. When she comes in, everybody stands up and we all do the Mount Saint Helen's cheer, all right? It goes like this: Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! (audience laughing) I knew you could handle it. Just like on the Father Arsenio Hall show, right? Let's everybody practice on the count of three. Ready, one, two, three! - [Everybody] Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! - Yes! Oh excellente, beautiful, beautiful. Okay, just sorta keep your eye over there. What, she's coming! - [Brother Michael] Folks she's here! Here she is, our own Reverend Mother Sister Mary Regina! - All right, stand up, come on! - [Everybody] Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! (audience applauding) - Woo, woo, woo! Sister, Sister! Sister! Robert Anne! (upbeat music) (Regina laughing) - Reverend Mother, we're not finished! - Oh you're finished all right. Let's hear it for the band! Good, good. Are we ready Hubert? - Oh, where's Sister Amnesia? - Sister Amnesia! - Oh Amnesia. - Sister! - Where is-- - [Reverend Mother] I see her, I see her hiding backstage. Come on dear. Amnesia. Come on dear. Nothing to be afraid of. Come on, come on. No it's normal. (audience laughing) Come on, come on. They won't bite ya. We're all friends here. Just have a little seat next to Robert Anne. She's a little nervous. She's just a big mess is what she is! (audience laughing) Are we ready now? - Yes we're ready now. - Right. (clicker clicking) Oh, brings back memories does it? Dear, could I have a little light please Sister? Yes, right here in the middle. No, here dear. Right here, follow my voice. There! Stop! Good! Sister Mary Myopia. (audience laughing) Our archery instructor. Sister Brendan, can you see me all right dear? Am I in the light? Yes. All right then. Well, good evening, friends. - [Everyone] Good evening Sister. - Oh, we can really train 'em can't we? On behalf of the Little Sisters of Hoboken, I'd like to say welcome to the theater of Mount Saint Helen's School. And I'd like extend our gratitude to each and everyone of you for showing up here this evening to participate in our fund-raising activities. Now, before we begin, I'd like to clear up what seems to be some small confusion about the set here. You see, our eighth graders are putting on the musical "Vaseline" and-- (audience laughing) - It's "Grease." - What? - "Grease." - What is? - "Grease." - [Hubert] "Grease." - Oh, it's "Grease!" It's "Grease." Anyway, I promised the children that we would not interfere with their handiwork during our benefit, so that's why things may seem a little incongruous at times. Now, we have a wonderful introductory number for you, but before we begin, let's ask the Lord to bless our endeavors. Sister Robert Anne, if you will.

Now, in case there's someone here who doesn't know what our little fundraiser is all about, well we had a small disaster back at the convent. You see, a short while ago, our cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, (audience laughing) made some vichyssoise soup and nearly every one of our sisters died instantly of botulism. - It was kind of like the "Last Supper!" (everyone laughing) That's a little convent humor. - Well we wouldn't be here tonight if we hadn't been off playing bingo with some Maryknolls. That's true. - What a bunch of cut-throats they turned out to be. I think their Mother Superior cheated when she didn't call B-15! - Well I thought-- - Well that's I need was a B-15. I would've cleaned right up. - Now don't get your - [Mary] knickers in a twist. Just calm down. (audience laughing) - I forgive her. - Well that's big of ya. The point is when we got back to the convent we found 52 of our sisters lying face down in that soup! - We had no idea what to do so we all began praying for guidance. - And then I had a vision! Now, it was either Saint Catherine of Siena-- (audience member laughing) (everyone laughing) You've seen her too. (everyone laughing) Or Saint Thomas Aquinas in drag! Well now, I've never been able to tell those two apart! Have you ever seen them together? Think about it. - Well? - What? Oh! I was instructed to use our own Sister Mary Cardelia as a model and start a little greeting card company. You know, to raise funds. Well, of course I did and it was a huge success! - Yeah, so we took the money and buried 48 of the 52 dead sisters, then Reverend Mother bought a VCR and a camcorder for the convent! Personally, I thought we should have buried all of the sisters before buying a VCR, but then as Mistress of Novices, I'm only "number two" so one tries hard not to question Reverend Mother. - [Both] And one will try harder in the future. - That's right, dear. So anyway, the important point is that we had to put the last four sisters in the freezer. - Oh, and, Sister Julia, Child of God, is having a fit about that. - And so that's the reason we're putting on this little show. We've got to raise enough money to bury those last four dead sisters! - Oh we hope you'll forgive the limitation put on us by the loss of so many of our sisters (chuckling), but if she hadn't bought the VCR, we wouldn't have to raise anymore money, and then there wouldn't be this little show in the first place. - But, I did, and we do, and there is, and so there you are! (imitates gun firing) Oh! Now, about a week ago I held tryouts for tonight's show and I chose those sisters whom I felt were the very best of what's left of us. And I asked each one of them to prepare something which best displays her talent. - Yes, but first, I thought you might be interested in some history of the Little Sisters of Hoboken - Oh yes, that's right. - [Hubert] and that is what our next song is all about. - Good, thank you Hubert, thank you. You see, we started out running a leper colony. Now I know some of you might find that a bit distasteful, but all the good causes were taken! Well it all began when, what? What? Here darling, you go over here. Here's where you belong. Over here. There you go. Did you have a nice trip? (audience laughing) Are you happy now Leo? Good. Now, as I was about to say, (Hubert clears throat) it all started, what? Oh yes, well she's right. If I give it all away now you won't enjoy the song. So what do you say we just do it?

Amnesia, where are you going? - I was just going with her! - Yes, but aren't you in charge of the quiz? - Oh, I forgot. - I just can't seem to get through to her Reverend Mother! - I know, I know. I keep hoping when she remembers who she is, we'll discover she belongs to the Franciscans. (audience laughing) - Now Sister, try to remember what I teach in the novitiate: Gentle, but firm. Got it? Okay. - Gentle, but firm! Ooh. Alright! Sit up straight! Eyes forward! Pay attention! Do you know what time it is? (ruler slapping) Ow. (audience laughing) Well you know, I always know what time it is. Yeah, 'cause you see, back at the convent we've got this huge clock with the 12 Apostles pasted on it! And I always know that when the big hand is on the John and little hand is on the Peter, it is time for the Sisters to go down on their knees. (audience laughing) And pray! Well, and now it's time for that quiz that Reverend Mother warned you about. Now you see, you see, I have here, now I have here the questions that you should have the answers to if you were paying attention to that last song! Yeah. Sister Myopia, could we have some light, please? Oh thank you! Okay now, if you know the answers you raise your hand. Okay! Are you ready? (audience responds) Yes who? Are you ready! - [Audience] Yes! - One more time, are you ready! - [Audience] Yes Sister! - Oh good. Okay. Question number one. The leper colony was established on an island south of? - [Audience] France! - Yeah, well right, but nobody raised their hand! And I got a prize and everything! But this gentleman, right here, right in front of me, I had my eyes on you. You moved your mouth and you said France, huh? You know, even though you didn't raise your hand, I'm gonna give you this holy prize, okay? Yeah. Yeah, you should be excited 'cause it's beautiful! Wait til you see this! Wait til you see this! Sir, you're really gonna love this. Look at this everybody! It's a Saint Christopher Motorist Prayer Book! Isn't that beautiful! Isn't that beautiful! (audience applauds) Yeah. Stand up, take a bow! Do you like that sir? - It's very nice. - Oh, I'm glad you like that, yeah. Look at this, there's a medal and everything, and there's a place for your name and your address. And here's a "I am a Catholic. "In case of an accident, please call a priest." Isn't that beautiful? (everyone laughing) Why are you laughing? Are you Catholic sir? - No Sister. - [Amnesia] You're not? - No ma'am. - What are you? - I'm Jewish. (everyone laughing) - Jewish. How nice. Well you know, you see this part here that says, "In case of an accident," you know, "I'm Catholic, please call a priest." You just kinda scratch that out, okay? I gotta ask you though, if you have an accident, who do you call? - Well, I would call a lawyer. (everyone laughing) - Well wait a minute, I gotta tell you something. It'll make you feel better. Saint Christopher? Yeah, he's no longer a saint. Yeah it's true. I think maybe he had an accident or something. He should've called you. (audience applauding) Okay, question number two. Now this one's harder than the first one. Oh yeah it is. Okay! Are you ready! - [Audience] Yes Sister! - Oh good! Okay. Question number two! Why, why did the Sisters leave the leper colony? (quiz timer binging) Nobody knows? Nobody knows? Come on, go ahead sir, go ahead sir! Yeah, go ahead, go ahead! They were falling to pieces! Sir, why not! I guess so! (everyone laughing) (dramatic music) Stand up, take a bow! (audience applauding) Here I come again! I bet you can't wait to see what I have for you, huh? Are you Catholic? - Sometimes. - Sometimes? I'm gonna give you this prize, okay? Wait til you see, you're really gonna love this. Look at this everybody! It's a beautiful plastic statue of a saint! Isn't that beautiful! Isn't that beautiful! Can I pass that to you? Isn't that beautiful? - Thank you. - [Amnesia] Do you know who that is? - No. - Well I don't know, I was asking you. (audience laughing) Wait a minute! Give it back to me. Sister, hello! Could you pass that down to her? Sister, do you know who that is? Are you okay Sister? You need a tissue or something? You don't know either? We're in trouble here. Take a guess Sister, anybody. Are you a Nun in disguise next to her? Oh you are. Well help her out! - Dominic Savio. - Who? - [Nun In Disguise] Dominic Savio - Dominic Savio? (Nun in disguise speaks too low) Yeah, okay. What did he do? (audience laughing) He was a boy saint. - Yes. - Oh, about 15-years-old. Okay, good, thank you! Here's a boy saint for an almost boy saint. (Amnesia laughing) This next question that I have here, question number three. Well now, this is one, this is one that Sister Hubert wanted me to ask. Okay. Question number three, "Do you think it was wrong "for Reverend Mother "to buy a VCR and camcorder "before all of the Sisters were buried?"

"If God had wanted everyone to look like people, - [Both] "he wouldn't have invented nuns." (imitates fart) - That's right dear. - But when I entered the convent, I planned to dedicate my life to God through the dance. If I can't wear a tutu, I'll never become a famous nun ballerina. - Sister Mary Leo!

My dream was to enter the convent, work my way up to Mother Superior, and then turn the Little Sisters of Hoboken into the Big Sisters of Newark!

(audience laughing) You got it, that's good. - Robert Anne, I'm just appalled! Now you show some respect. - Now, take a chill pill there Rev. - Chill pill? - Hey, hey, hey! I got another little surprise for you too. - Another surprise? - Yeah. I realized that when you arranged the program for this evening, you had forgotten to include a solo for me. So Brother Micheal and I, we have worked out the most wonderful song and I thought you could find a spot for it in the show. Just a second. Brother Michael, if you will.

Because Julia's never really got a handle on her vocation. Now you take last week for example. We were having the Monsignor over for dinner and I asked Julia to prepare something a little special. Well, a little while later I see her in the kitchen setting up the ironing board. And I says, "Well Julia, what in hell are you doing?" And she says, "Well I'm gonna making pressed duck!" (duck quacking) No, no, it's not a joke. I'm serious! I'm serious! I'm telling you it's not easy. We used to have 71 members in our order. Now thanks to that nitwit Julia, we're down to 19! I just thought maybe if you knew a little more about us you might-- Not now dear, I'm talking. - Reverend Mother! - What? - Reverend Mother! - [Mary] What is it? - I thought I was supposed to tell this part? - Oh my goodness, I'm sorry. Yes I did. I promised dear little Sister who's it here that she could tell this part. Good, you go right on dear. You little dear amnesiac you. Hubert, would you keep an eye on her while I run to the little nuns room? (light music) - Hello! - [Audience] Hello! - Now my name is Sister Mary... For a moment there, I thought I almost remembered my real name. Well anyway, I'm here to tell you what being a nun means to me! Can you hear me in the back! (audience responds) Oh good.

You've been here all day practicing with us. - Yes, but he called yesterday. - [Hubert And Mary] What? - Amnesia, why don't you tell me these things? - [Sisters] I forgot. - Well this is terrible. Now you must go and call the convent right away and see if anything's happened. Oh Hubert, this is awful! I thought I told you to tell me to see that she always reports everything to me. - Now don't try to blame this one on me. You're the one that bought the VCR. - Well, I don't see what that - has to do with anything. - Well, it has everything! - [Hubert] What are you talking about? No, no, no! - You know I didn't realize - There are 52 Sisters, there wouldn't be if you counted the enough money! 52 Sisters, - [Hubert] There's gonna be enough money, yes! (upbeat music) (Sisters humming) - [Mary] Turn that thing off! - [Amnesia] Reverend Mother! - What? - [Amnesia] Reverend Mother! - What? - [Amnesia] Reverend Mother! - What! - I got the answering machine. - Yes. Well what did it say? - "Hello, this is the convent"-- - Amnesia! Jump forward. (speaks gibberish) (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - And Sister Ralph Marie had to go down to the Board of Health for questioning. - Oh no. Oh, well now you've done it. Oh now you've really done it. Oh now this is a wonderful spot you've put us in. - But I'm sorry Reverend Mother. I mean, I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't know. I didn't know, I'm sorry! (Amnesia crying) - [Robert Anne] Amnesia don't go! - [Hubert] Regina, you didn't have to be so hard on her! - Well I didn't mean it, you know I didn't mean it. Go and see if she's all right. - Me? - Yes, go already. I tell you, it's not easy being a Mother Superior these days. Well in these permissive times trying to be a leader is almost impossible. Take Robert Anne for example. Now when she joined the convent they told me she was streetwise. Well, I thought that meant she knew her way around town. Oh. That girl knows things you won't see on Cable Television. Just this morning she comes into my office and says she's writing a book for her gym class on feminine hygiene. You know what she's calling it? "The Catholic Girl's Guide to an Immaculate Conception." (audience laughing) Well I don't think it's funny. It's not easy! Sometimes I wonder why I became a nun in the first place. I didn't have to you know. Now, the other Sisters don't know this, but I started off to be a tightrope walker. No, I'm not making this. My mother and father had a high wire act. They were billed as Two Tons on a Tightrope. They were both a bit on the hefty side. My father said if we just practiced hard enough we could be better than the Flying Wallendas. Oh all us kids were in the act. All except Mary Clare. That's our sister. She took up with a contortionist. One night they were trying out a new position. I don't want to talk about it. It's just too terrible. Anyway, I was telling you something-- Oh, I was telling you about the act. Yes, well, we got booked in London and we had a wire stretched across the river. You know, as a publicity stunt, no net mind ya. So Two Tons on a Tightrope, we're up there on the wire when suddenly it snapped and boom, boom! Two Tons in the Thames! (everyone laughing) Well, I promised the Lord right then and there that if He'd save them I'd become a nun. How was I to know He was gonna pull 'em through? But if you want to know the truth, not that I'm here, I wouldn't have it any other way. (Regina chuckling) Still though, I gotta tell you something.

Ooh, ooh! (Regina coughing) Ooh that smells awful! Oh good Lord. Why would anybody want this stuff? Oh it just smells-- (Regina sniffing and laughing) Is it warm in here? I'm getting awful warm. (Regina chuckling) It must be this thing-a-ma-bob here. Well now I don't know what the girls are doing with this. It can't be good for you though. I mean, it just smells awful.

Why don't nuns do drugs? - Why don't nuns do drugs? - 'Cause they already have a habit! (drum sting) (everyone laughing) Sister, tell yours, tell yours, yeah. - All right, all right, I have one. Why did Moses wander around the desert for 40 years? - Why? - He's a man, do you think he would stop for directions? (everyone laughing and applauding) - [Amnesia] What's your name? - Yo, Sister Hubert. - I love that joke, - [Hubert] It gets them every time. - Sister Hubert, excuse me. - What dear? - [Robert Anne] I need to speak with you right away.

Go ahead, talk amongst yourselves. Well be right back. I have just found out that Reverend Mother is still back stage doing penance. Guess what that means? The understudy is on! (audience applauding) Hang on, I got a great idea. Don't go away, just a second. Okay, you can get ready for the next number, I'll handle everything here. No sweat. - Are you sure you're okay? - Oh yeah, no problem. Hey. - Oh no. - All right. Now I have you alone here to myself. For a few moments anyway. I think we have time for this. I would like to share with you something that I think you'll get a little kick out of. And that's more of my habit humor. Okay, here it comes. (Robert Anne humming) (audience laughing) Now, I know that you're probably all wondering what nuns do in their spare time right? Well, this particular nun likes to hang around and create other strange looking nuns. For instance, Sister Pocahontas. How, how. ♪ Yodle-ay-he-hoo ♪ Sister Heidi! Sister Pippi Longstockings! Attila the Nun. Here's one of my old favorites. Twisted Sister! Oh, and the night would not be complete without a little political humor, right? Okay, here we go. I've no experience running up a four trillion dollar deficit, but I'm all ears. (audience laughing) Okay, I got one more. Now this is going to be a legendary actress of the stage and screen okay. How 'bout some mood music on this one brother? Yeah, thank you. (light piano solo) That's great. Okay, this takes a couple extra seconds to stick this one together, so just bare with me okay. (Robert Anne humming) Oh you know, sometimes I do this for my students. Oh yeah, they think it's hysterical. Of course, they love to laugh, you know how it is. But that's how I reach them, get through to them, by being funny. Yeah I do. I teach seventh graders. Oh, that is a rough age to be though, you know. I know 'cause I remember. Oh yeah. When I was in seventh grade, I got sent to Saint Clare's School for the Deplorable. Okay here we go, here we go. The final impression of the evening. The calla lilies are in bloom again! Thank you, thank you. (audience applauding) Thanks a lot. Oh, oh, by the way, let's not mention this to you know who, all right? I mean Reverend Mother does not always appreciate my methods or behavior. Eh. Well, no, no. You gotta understand, see. I grew up in Canarsie. You know where that is? That's in Brooklyn! Yo Mamma! Scungili! Yeah, you had to be tough too, and I was. I was a tough little kid, you know. Well see, my dad was never around, my mom had to work two jobs, she left us kids alone all the time. I was always in trouble, which is why I got sent to Saint Clare's. But, it's okay, you know. Things worked out. They did, I'm here right? Hey, you know what? My background even paid off a little bit, really. Not only do I drive the convent car, but I can also strip it faster than any mechanic in Hoboken! (audience laughing) Oh boy, oh boy. Some of my old friends still cannot believe that I'm a nun. But I'd like to tell you why. It's all because of Sister Rose Francis. Yeah. (slow paced music) She was the head of Saint Clare's and boy, oh boy. She was somethin' else. She was the one person who made me believe that I really was worth something.

(light music) (slow paced music) (audience applauding) - Sister Leo! - Robert said you'd think it'd be funny. - Robert Anne, it's not funny. Now I've just about had it with you. Now get her out of that thing. (audience laughing) - It was just a joke. - Well it wasn't funny. Who do you think you are, Sally Field? - Yes! And they liked me! They really liked me! - Oh get out of here! Go on, get out of here! Hubert! - What happened? - [Regina] Stop that, she'll see you. - Oh now, it was pretty funny. - No it wasn't. Not only do I have to contend with Robert Anne, now she's trying to corrupt the novices. - Oh now, she's not so bad. At least she isn't in jail. - Well, never mind. We have something much more interesting and exciting to discuss. And I'm talking about the publication of this book. "Baking With the BVM." - Oh Reverend Mother, I think that some of the people in our audience may have brought non-Catholic friends who should explain that the B.V.M. is the Blessed Virgin Mary. - Well, I was just about to get around to that. Thank you Hubert. "Baking With The Blessed Virgin Mary." - Oh Reverend Mother. - [Regina] What? - You look like the Pope! - Oh. (audience laughing) - Show 'em your imitation. - What? - Regina come on. You want to see her imitation of the Pope don't ya? - Oh! - Yeah, yeah! (audience cheering) - [Regina] All right, all right, the Pope. (everyone laughing) Or, in Italian. Stop that, stop that. That's enough of that. All right, now then. First of all, well, the book has a beautiful cover. It's full color picture of our blessed Mother in her little cooks hat and apron. Awe you're gonna love it! Look here, don't ya love it? Isn't she precious? What dear? What? Oh yes. Amnesia tells me that she's made a lovely wooden stand for the book. Let's see. (audience laughing) Did you make that dear? - Yes. - She made it. - Ah. - All by yourself? - Yes. - All by herself. - [Regina And Hubert] Nice house, nobody home. - Amnesia, look up there! What's that, an angel? Oh look, all clean. Well now, let's just look inside. Oh yes, well. I can see the main section here is just chock full of unusual recipes. Especially suited for the Catholic kitchen. Now here's Cesar Franck's Panis Angelicus. A delightful taste treat consisting of anchovies wrapped around hot dogs and served on a piece of angel food cake. Has anybody actually tested this stuff? - Why no, we only saw the book today. You were supposed to go over all of this with Julia. - I was not supposed to go over anything. - You said that you were gonna go over it. - I did not say I was. - Yes you did. - You came over to me and told-- - Well never mind, it's too late now! - In a word, yes. - Oh yes! - [Regina] Let's just move right along and find some other. How 'bout dessert sections? That should be safe. Yes, this doesn't look too bad here. Mortally sinful devil's food cake. - If you eat that you'll go to hell! - Oh yes. Yes you little-- - Oh look it here. Mary Magdalene Tarts. Bet you they're easy! - And cheap! - Oh Reverend Mother look! - [Regina] What dear? - Whoa, here's a recipe for boy scouts. - Well why don't you read that one Sister. - Oh thank you. - Well I mean out loud Sister. - "Boy Scout Treats. "First, get 12 brownies real hot." (Hubert gasps) - Oh dear Lord! - Obviously a misprint. How about this, holiday recipes. Yes, here's one. "Turkey Stuffing Ala Marcia Lewis." - Hm, must be a friend of Julia's. - Yes. It says you take one package of regular stuffing mix. - Regular stuffing mix. - One onion minced. - One onion minced. - One cup of unpopped popcorn. - One cup of unpopped popcorn. - Mix it all together. - Mix it all together. - Stuff it in your bird. - Stuff it in your bird. - Put your bird in your oven. - Put your bird in the oven. - 400 degrees. - 400 degrees. - And when his ass blows off he's done. - And when his ass blows off... (audience laughing) - Well, I should've known better than to trust that lame-brain Julia. We can't sell this book. - Well what are we going to do? We were counting on the books to bring in some extra money? - Oh, I could do my bird calls! - And I can do my fire baton. - [Hubert] No fire batons. - I could do my number. - [Regina] What? - I could do my number. - Well all right then, do your number. - You mean it? - Yes, now get over there and do it before I change my mind. The way things are falling to pieces around here, I feel like I'm back in the leper colony. - Well how could Julia be so stupid! - How could I be so stupid?

(audience laughing) Reverend Mother, I'm Sister Mary Paul. - Sister Mary Paul. That's a nice name, isn't it Hubert? (audience laughing) - Well now, I seem to remember hearing about a Sister Mary Paul when we were in France, but when we'd got back here nobody knew what had become of her and then you mysteriously appeared and all you could tell us was a crucifix had fallen on your head. So you're Mary Paul? - Yes. - Do you remember everything? - Yes, well I think I do. You see, I won this big contest and I was on my way-- - Contest! That's it! Mary Paul! That was the name of the nun who won the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes! And nobody could find her! So that's you? Well we've got the money. Oh saints be praised! We're rich! (organ music) ♪ Gloria ♪ (singing in foreign language) - Somebody call Ed McMahon! - This means we can bury the last four dead sisters! - Oh yeah! And we can get a 36-inch screen for the VCR. - And I helped! - Yes you did, yes you did! To tell you the truth, I was getting a little bit nervous about having to defrost those girls tomorrow morning. - Yeah, and Jersey smells bad enough as it is. - [Regina] Oh Robert Anne! - It just goes to show that the Lord does, indeed, work in mysterious ways. - Oh one minute we're desperate-- - And the next minute, we're rich! - You just never know what the Almighty has planned. - Today, the Mistress of Novices, tomorrow-- - Tomorrow, the world could be saluting the first nun ballerina! - That's right dear, just don't give up your day job. (audience laughing) But the important thing is we can finally send those last four Sisters off to claim their heavenly reward, and we can get back to concentrating on our heavenly rewards, because as you know, each and every one of us here tonight has the potential to become a saint. - Oh, and you know something? - What?
