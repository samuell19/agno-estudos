That’s so you, darling! Late for your own viewing. THE MANEATER When did it happen? OK. Who was that? My dad’s dead. Lord, turn our hearts of stone into hearts of flesh. Have mercy, Lord. We pray for those who suffer, that they may not lose hope and may see Your light in the darkness. Have mercy, Lord. Late for your own father’s funeral! And you could have made an effort. You’re dressed like... A whore? On such a day! You don’t get the chance to bury your dad every day! Have you no shame? Do you remember what my memories of dear Daddy are? - My condolences, Madame de Courcy. - Thank you, Father. - Have you met my daughter, Jezabel? - No. I’ll introduce you. Jezabel. This is Father David. - Hello, Monsieur. - No, you call him “Father”. She’s right. Since our only real father is God. I’ve fixed your bike. Just a loose wire. Thanks, Stan. Madame de Courcy, my prayers are with you. Goodbye. Goodbye, and thank you. Mother, it’s Jezabel. Can you give me the number of that priest, please? Thanks. - You’ve got nerve. - No! I tell you, he’s gorgeous! Don’t kid yourself. They don’t have sex. Well, not as much as normal guys. It won’t be easy, even for you. Even for me? Come here, let me explain. Not only shall I trap him and get him in my bed, I’ll also have him at my feet. - Want to bet? - OK, but I’ll need proof. Proof? Not catching you in bed. Too obvious. I know! Listen... I’ll bring you his dog collar as a trophy, OK? You’re such a bitch! I adore you! Shit, it’s Greg! Quick, quick... Weren’t you coming back tomorrow? Engine trouble. The flight didn’t go. Imagine if we’d taken off! - You think it’s funny? - Because you’re afraid of flying. A flight steward who’s afraid of flying, brilliant! If I’m just a joke, I’m going to bed! No, come on, we’ll take you out! We’ll take you out, sweetie. At least smile. Sulking like that, you won’t find your Prince Charming. You’re she-devils. Why am I so fond of you? Because you’re like everyone else. You like to suffer. To our beautiful sadomasochistic neurotic world! Your married man is here. No, not him! Father David... What a shit name! Hello, this is Jezabel. You buried my father last week. Could you call me back, please, at 06-775-738. Thanks. Shit! Yes, it’s Jezabel again. Could you call me back soon, please? A friend of mine would like to be baptized. Thanks. Jez... Where are you going? Lunch with a New York gallery owner interested in your work. - Is that all? - He’s got a lovely ass! Piss off! What’s up? He’s dumped me. Who? Igor. I thought you’d split up. He called me last week... I gave in. And that’s not all. I lent him my debit card. He’s emptied my account. You’re such a dickhead! I trusted him. - Trusted him? - Yes, trusted him. That’s how I am. I believe in sincerity... loyalty... and love. I’ve heard it before. Can’t you see the world’s a shithole? I don’t like it when you talk like that. Love is bullshit, OK? The world isn’t Romeo and Juliet, it’s Sodom and Gomorrah. Understand? You, Sodom, me, Gomorrah. Lost forever in this shitty world. You, Sodom, me, Gomorrah. OK? It’s not surprising that babies scream when they’re born. Right, my little Sodom? I pity you, Jez. Your life must be so sad. Loser! Father David? Yes, of course. No, you’re not disturbing me. All right. Fine. I know the place. Great. See you tomorrow. Sorry I’m late. It’s OK. Usually, it’s me. Do you want the same? No, thanks. I’ll have a coffee. Coffee, please. Don’t you drink? Yes, but I have work to do. And I can’t hold it well. - That’s good to know. - Sorry? It’s good to know one’s limits, right? It’s better not to have any. - Pretty rock’n’roll for a priest! - No. God wants us to push ourselves. So, tell me. My latest exhibition is really doing well, and... - Your friend. - My friend? The one who wants to get baptized. You told me on the phone. Yes, that’s right. - Well... - What’s going on? How can I put it? There’s a lot going on in her head. But I think she’s made her mind up. That’s great. Baptism is a rebirth. And it’s never too late. Am I talking more like a priest now? Yes. Go on, call her. Strike while the iron is hot. God is patient, but I’m not. Hello. This is Erika. Father David. Delighted to meet you. Me too, Father. Stan, my friend and acolyte. - Delighted. - Me too. It’s a fairy-tale table. Like in this film I saw when I was little. There’s a princess disguised as a scullery maid, wearing some sort of animal hide... Donkey Skin. My favorite film. Yes, that’s it. Jezabel, what’s your favorite film? I don’t know. I know what it is. Basic Instinct. No, Caligula! The scene where the Romans... Can you give me a hand in the kitchen, please? What the hell are you playing at? You’re pissed! I needed a drink to swallow all that bullshit, my sexy girl... You’re a total mess! That Erika is hot! I think I’m in there. You know what I think about sex before marriage. A little bit, now and then... Champagne! And chocolate cake. Champagne... The last time I had some was at your dad’s funeral, Jez. Stan! It’s OK. There wasn’t much love lost between me and my dad. Nor you and your mom. You noticed? To Erika’s conversion! To Jesus! To you! Cheers. I want to talk about Mary Magdalene. A great lady. A special saint. Surprising, even. And paradoxical. Mary Magdalene, a woman who was lost, disillusioned, troubled by demons... But she took the risk of loving. She met Jesus... - Hello, how are you? - Fine, thank you, Father. Come with me, please. Allow me to introduce Erika, who’s joining our community. Her friends Greg and Jezabel, a painter. Also bisexual, neurotic and alcoholic. Artists like a joke. Yes, bats in the belfry! - We’re recruiting. - Sorry? - The choir. Are you available? - I have a terrible voice. But my friend has an extraordinary voice. - Sweet and enchanting. - Cut it out! An excellent idea. Some new blood in the choir. - No. - You can’t refuse! Come on, Jez, say yes! Going to mass, what a brilliant idea! - Did you see Stan in the choir? - Shut up! He’s a complete idiot. It was brilliant! What’s the point of that guy? The guy was born with it branded into his forehead: loser! And what’s branded on our foreheads? Slut? Eat, drink, screw, make up, break up... Erika and Jezabel’s magic roundabout, open 24/7! Don’t get all worked up, I was joking. Well, I’m not! I’m going to my studio. Don’t call me, I want to be alone. Erika told me you were here. Greg suggested the burger. So when you work you become unsociable? No food, on your own... No, I nourish myself on the fruit of the vine. I have some grands crus among my paints. - Really? - Yeah. What’s that? That painting? Oh, that. A self-portrait. You’re not very kind to yourself. Who knows? Maybe you have the soul of a saint. Who knows? To the princess in you! What is it? I’m a bit embarrassed. - Nothing can embarrass me. - Oh, yeah? Really? - Really. - OK, then... In three months it’s our parish auction sale. I know you’re in vogue right now. So I was wondering if you’d do a painting that we could sell for the poor. Of course. You’re refusing. No, not at all. Three months isn’t long enough, is that it? No. It’s just not what I was expecting. What were you expecting? Nothing. Thanks, anyway. It’s great. I’m really pleased. - And I didn’t dare ask. - Well, you were right to. It’s late, I’d better go. - See you soon. - See you. And we’ll expect you for choir practice, Wednesday. What are you playing at? Stop posing and sing! - Sing! - Old bag. - Sorry? - And deaf with it! I have to confess, and quick. - You think it’s funny? - No. A young person needing to confess isn’t funny. I’m concerned. On the other hand, I’m saddened by how you discourage those who don’t fit your template! People like you are emptying our churches. Come into the vestry. You prefer on your knees? Can you really see me confessing? All I wanted was to get you into bed. Erika’s baptism was just a way of getting to see you. As women seem to have no effect on you. I don’t know, maybe you’re gay. As soon as I saw you I wanted you. When I screw someone else, I think of you. So, Father... - Do I have an effect on you? - You don’t know what you’re saying. Yes, I do. You know what? It gets me hot. Out! This is no place for girls like you. Really? That’s not what you said in your sermon. All that crap about forgiveness and redemption. Who was Mary Magdalene? I’m a soul to be saved. What is it you say? A sheep that’s strayed? Yeah, right. You’ve got nothing between your legs! Get out. Get out! Screw me! What’s got into you? Stop it, Jez. Stop it. Screw me. Hurt me! Ready, sweetie? It’s time to go. With all the buzz around you, this interview has to be good. Don’t worry, darling. He’ll be eating out of my hand. OK, I’ve got all I need. Thank you, Jezabel. It’ll make a great article. It was my pleasure. I’ll let you know when it’ll be published. I look forward to it. Jezabel, please. How long will it take me to pick him up? I don’t know. - Jez, we have to talk. - What do you want? - Don’t run away... - There’s nothing to say! - My life’s ruined. - It was just sex! If your missus has dumped you, tough! My missus? I’d never been unfaithful until you. You hear me? Never, before you! Take responsibility for what you do! Make the most of it, Jezabel. Make the most of your beauty, your youth... You’ll end up alone with your black soul! I don’t believe this. Get out of here, do you hear me? Get out of here! - You can’t... - Hey, broken heart! You’re really getting on our nerves now. I’ve got an idea. Come on. A farewell gift. Understood? Save me. Save me. Please. Did we make love? You’re completely obsessed. I’ll call you “Obsessed”. No, “One-Track Mind”. It suits you. Did you sleep well? These were in your pocket. What’s this? - I’ve had it since I was nine. - Really? Allow me to introduce One-Track Mind. Or Nikita. Take your pick. I got what you wanted. Great. Thanks a lot. See you later. What’s with these clothes? They’re for the poor. You spoil them. It’s ready. Sit over there. Lord, we thank You for Your gifts, seen and unseen, for the bread of life, Jesus Christ, and for this food. Please bless us. And help all those in pain. Amen. Well, bon appétit! Thanks. So what happened? Did you fall off your heels? You can be funny when you try. Is he still sulking? You have a short memory. It was a scandal in the church. Your church isn’t the world. Listen to me... You were in a bad way. That’s why I let you in. So show some respect for others. And for my church! - Like it’s your woman. - Does that bother you? You’re gorgeous when you’re angry. I disgust myself. I was born a misfit and I’ll die a misfit. I was raised by 4-star parents, but so messed up. I’m disgusted by everything. I feel like a broken doll, 600 years old. I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. Your life is valuable. Someone you don’t yet know loves you. You? You understand. - Your boss? - That’s right, my boss. Don’t give me that crap! A kid... That’s what you are. Stan. - Stan. - Leave me alone. Stan, what’s got into you? There’s the stink of sulfur about that girl! Remember where I found you? How we met? Why should that girl in particular be demonized? Because she’s sexy? Religion is only for the old and the ugly? Forgive me, Father. I’m a sorry piece of work. No. Father David? - Your clothes for the poor. - Great. Thanks. Where are we going? - Surprise. - To the sea for a night of love? One-Track Mind! - David, good timing. - Are you fighting? It’s like a civil war between us. It’s since Loretta came to Lourdes with you. She’s singing hymns, scaring off the customers. - Saying the rosary too. - Look. Shut up! - Men’s madness is God’s wisdom. - If you say so. Look... I thought of you. David! My medal. You’re a love! The housing association want to kick me and my brother out. They can’t do that. The concierge family can’t stand us. Yesterday, they barred our door with rubbish. Trying to get out, I got my dress all dirty. My favorite, really tight one. We’ll talk to them. Tomorrow night at 8? I should be getting waxed, but OK. It grows so fast! - What’s the address? - 87 Rue d’Hauteville. 10th arrondissement, Paris. - Hauteville as in “high” and... - Yeah, yeah. - Paris. Tomorrow at eight? - Yes, tomorrow. - Tomorrow, then, at eight? - Yeah, I’ve made a note. OK, Daisy. Well, girls, look after yourselves. God bless you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. And now your old men? After this I’m dropping you at home. How are you, Captain? OK, shipmate. Look at my machine! Don’t get caught speeding. A real pin-up! Captain, at your service! Say hello. - Hello, young lad. How are you? - Fine, and you? - As long as I’ve got my health. - How true. Jezabel, Mr. Truong. Roselyne! How are you? Not too cold? Meet Jezabel. A newcomer among us. Who wants some stylish trousers? I knew you’d like them. She likes them. What else have I got? I have this... You’re coughing in my soup! Did you screw him? Got his dog collar? Is he good? - Are you in love? - No. Are you in love? No, I said. Have a nice day. See you next Sunday. Goodbye. Can you lock the church up? I have an appointment. I’ll see to it. You know why we’re here? - No. - About the fairy! Sorry? I was saying it was about... the lady. Right. About the lady. I see you’re religious. Yes. God is our whole life. Great. That’s nice. And what do you think our Lord thinks of you? Do you think He’s happy about the way you treat Miss Daisy? But that’s completely different. She scares the children. She is a bit weird. I understand. She’s weird. Better stone her, eh? Like in the good old days? Oh, come now... I’d rather be whipped! God alone has the right to judge. - I agree with you there. - Yes. God gives His love freely. So? I’m asking you to leave this poor woman and her brother alone. But... she’s living in sin. Are you without sin, then? Do you know what you’re doing? Tarnishing the image of Christ. You think that’s what religion is? Statues? No. God is love. Do you understand? Love. Why go to church if your heart is empty? - I handled it badly. - No. Your were firm and passionate. We need more of that. - You think so? - I’m telling you. You’re a crap lover but a fine orator. They’ll leave her alone now. I hope so. I’m telling you. I’m coming. Where is he? - Why? - None of your business. - It is! I love him. - So do I. With your body. I love him with my heart. You think I haven’t noticed your game. You’re like a bitch in heat. You got a hard-on for him or something? You’re despicable! We’re like brothers. - Where is he? - No way! He’s out, anyway. Where? With the Carmelites in Normandy. Please tell me where he is. Don’t you get it? He saved my life, so now I’m saving him. As long as I’m here, I’ll keep you from him, witch! If there isn’t room for both of us, then you’re out, OK? All right, Sister Sophie, you may leave. Very well, Mother. I wish you both a pleasant evening. Go on, my girl, be off with you! They’re increasingly chatty. When I was a novice, aged 17, we obeyed Saint Teresa’s rules to the letter. I know. You’ve told me a hundred times. They obeyed to the letter. Nothing like today’s girls! My little David... I understand that things change, but God’s word is unchanging. And no one forced us to become Carmelites. That’s true. You’re right there. Sorry to bother you. There’s a young woman who wants to see Father David. Well, show her in. I had to see you. I’ve finished the painting. What painting? Sorry, Sister. My name is Jezabel. I work with David. With David? What sort of work? I commissioned a painting for the parish auction. She’s an artist. But she shouldn’t be here. How did you find me? Stan. Sorry, Mother. You shouldn’t be here. That’s no way to welcome someone trying to help you. We’re not very used to receiving guests here, but all the same... You may stay, young lady. But the rules of Saint Teresa! Exactly! We must not close the door of our house or our heart. - But, Mother... - Anyway, it’s pouring down. Sister Sophie. Prepare the cell next door to yours, make the bed, and turn the radiator on. The heating’s broken down. Oh, yes. In that case give her two blankets. I must get ready for complines. I’ll come with you. Shall we go? Why didn’t you stay? I asked you a question. I don’t know. It was weird, it stressed me out. Stressed? Anyway, my place isn’t here. Really? Where is your place, then? Sister. I have something to show you. So there’s the painting! Do you believe in God? No. It’s strange. Allow me to say that... He... believes in you. That painting isn’t the work of a somber soul. I’m not somber. You’re passionate. You’re rebellious. But don’t worry. The light shines, even in the darkness. God knows the secrets in our hearts. It’s a great painting. Thanks. You’re welcome. You shouldn’t have. - What? - The flowers. They’re for the Virgin, not you. I think she never has enough. Isn’t that nun a bit weird? The way she looks at people. Like she’s reading what’s inside you. No, if she read inside me, I’d be out of here! - You still don’t know God. - God? He’s the invisible man! If he existed, there wouldn’t be all this suffering. The devil exists too. He sends all the suffering. The trials. Right! He’s strong because people don’t believe in him. He does what he wants. You’ve got it bad. Let’s go. Thanks for everything. - See you in Paris? - OK. See you soon, Jezabel. I’ll pray for you. - Captain, watch my painting. - No problem. I told you to stay away and you went to the convent. You’re hurting me. I’m from the streets. I can really hurt you! You don’t scare me! Five hundred? - 800. - 800 from the lady. - 1,200. - 1,200 on the left. - 2,000. - 2,500. - 3,000. - 3,000 from the lady. Anyone else? 6,000. 6,000! Going once, twice, three times... Gone! - Can I have a word? - What’s wrong? It’s complicated. What a face! We’ve hit the jackpot thanks to you. The money’s gone. - Is this a joke? - I saw Stan take it. - Are you sure? - I saw him with my own eyes! Stan, is this how you thank me? Yet again! - What are you talking about? - Come off it! Where’s the money? What money? I didn’t take anything. I know you. Did that whore tell you this? That whore? Don’t you touch her! OK, princess, you win. He’s all yours. Don’t worry about the money. I’ll paint some more. It’s not that. It’s the betrayal. I thought of him as a brother. He was a Judas. I’m here. I met him just after I’d been ordained. He was my first lost sheep. Why did you become a priest? I fell in love with God. As a very young child. I used to play at saying mass in my parents’ cellar. God is my absolute. I really love Him. When you love someone that much you want to be as one. That’s what I’m doing. I love you. Stop it. - Stop it now. - No. - Give me the key. - Come and get it! Give me the key! Give it to me! Yes, get back to your god like a faithful dog! What are you playing at? Eh? What? Shut up! Get the fuck off me! I’m free. Free? You’re a prisoner of sex! Of your drugs! Of your arrogance! Your freedom is a prison! At least I know how to love. You know how to love? You know how to love? Look at yourself. You don’t love anyone. No one. Not even yourself. I feel sorry for you. My Lord... Lord, don’t abandon me. I’m a weak man. I need You. You’re my whole life, Lord. Don’t give up on me. Deliver me from that woman. From her red-hot thoughts. From her smell which I carry in my blood. Deliver me from her eyes that I obey. From her mouth which calls to me. I am Yours, Lord, body and soul. Don’t let me go. Don’t let me go. Give me the strength to resist, Lord. I beg You. I can no longer pray. Do you want a drink? That. A toast? No, just drink. I’ve been looking for you all my life. I’ve been dreading you all my life. Stop it! Stop it! - Stop it! - Leave me alone! Stop it! I never want to see you again. Never. - Can you give this to David? - I’m afraid not. Father David had a motorcycle accident. He always did go too fast. He died in the hospital. He asked for a priest so he could confess. But it was too late. He’ll have to explain himself to God. David... Sorry. They’ve cut the electricity off. It’s strange but... I’ve missed you. I feel at peace with you. I’m no longer afraid. I act tough but in reality I’m terrified. David noticed that. I really did love him. Yes, I know. I’ve spent my life running from others. And from myself. You know, Sister... It’s not believing in God that’s hard. It’s believing in people. The time of reconciliation has come. You’re ready. What reconciliation? Your reconciliation with yourself. With others. With God. It’s too late for me, Sister. For you, maybe. But not for Him. How could God be interested in a girl like me? I stink of sin. I’m overflowing with sin. I’m done for. Despair is our worst enemy, Jezabel. And evil’s best ally. God’s mercy. It’s all there. It’s not a question of forgetting, but of moving forward. You’re standing before a door that you’ve never seen before. And the key is in your heart. You have free will. God forces no one. He loves us too much to do that. The choice is yours. If you wait to be a saint to love God, you’ll never love him
