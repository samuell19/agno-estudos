[Voice from radio]: There's a deviation noticed in Skylab's expected path. If NASA can't control that, there are high chances of Skylab falling on earth. If the debris falls on India, the damage will be high. I need every update about Skylab. Trace its trajectory. If people find out that there is a space station that weighs 90,000 kilos... ...is about to fall on them, they will freak out. No one should know about this until we figure out how to deal with it. It's a secret for now... and I hope it remains a secret. Also... there is no one else in the room, right? Did anyone else listen in? [dog panting] [Female VO]: 1979. Neelam Sanjeev Reddy decided to start Mandal commission. Vijayanagaram was recognized as a district in Andhra Pradesh. Mother Teresa received the Nobel prize. But she's still seen standing outside offices clad in a simple white saree. Far away from all these happenings, thoughts and progress, India... There's a small village in South India. [thuds] [pigeon coos] Bandalingampalli. BANDALINGAMPALLI KARIMNAGAR DIST There is no village like it. There are no villagers anywhere like here. A sixty year old temple of Lord Rama. But still to this day, the Dalits aren't allowed into it. PEOPLE OF LOWER CASTE NOT ALLOWED In anger with this policy... Here's Lachi carving out an idol in the likeness of the deity in the temple. But how does Lachi know... how the sculpture inside looks if he's never stepped inside? The arrow of Rama is here. One thing you'll find everyday at sunrise in the temple premises is Chinna running around. Not because he's devout, but because he's got eyes on the coins the devotees throw in the temple's pond. [water splashes] [keeps counting] Chinna! Chinna! Chinna! Where are you off to in the sun? This old village clinic has been shut down fifteen years back with locks, amulets and a couple of exorcisms. There are so many rumours and fears but no one knows for sure why it is. An old and rickety RTC bus, -Ticket please! -filled with stories. And it all starts here. I don't have the change, will give you before your stop comes. WEALTH IS THE FUEL What happened? What are you feeling inconvenient? You would know it better if I show my cards. -Will you play your turn or not? -You aren't compromising anywhere... Dad, do you have two tens? Do you have one twenty? No. Then I'm also empty. Stop it dad. People like you throw away a pot of gold saying there is no place in the attic. What are you talking? Hey! Hey! -Only ten rupees... Master! Ten rupees. On this fellow. -If he's betting on Ramarao, -Hello! then the money's as good as gone. Show your cards. King... King... King. No need to show your cards. I'll take the money. -Wait! -Show him! Ace... Ace... Ace. -Ramarao, you won! -The ten I put in. The ten I got. What would you have done if I had two kings and an ace? There are 52 cards in a deck. 13 spades and 4 kings. Calculating all the possibilities... He peeked into your cards behind you. If I lost it would have been my dad's ten! If I won it would have been my ten. That's all I thought. Anand. Ramarao. Subedar Ramarao. Ask anyone in the village. They'll tell you. My grandfather... Tell him about my grandfather. Isn't he dead? He's dead. Who's that? Our zamindar's daughter. Lives in hyderabad. Looks like she arrived today. WELCOME TO THE DAUGHTER OF GODDESS SARASWATHI Whistle as soon as Gauri madam car arrives. Show me! Louder. He fell. She'll come any moment now. Not one of them can do proper work. Put away that book first. What's with this forceful lying down? Am I a child? In the letter we wrote her your health is frail and you're weak. If you're waltzing around when she walks in, she'll bring down the roof. She'll take out her anger on the editor, on us. Lie down for today. I will. But first let me smoke one cigarette. I can't smoke if she comes. Gauri madam's job is in Hyderabad. A huge magazine called 'Prathibimbam'. She is the heart and soul of the magazine. Shaking heads as if you know Pratibimbham. Know it? If Gauri madam is absent for one day, all work comes to a stand still. Everyone has read her writings. Is that so? I'm also from Hyderabad. -I've never read her writings. -Never? Aren't you the zamindar's daughter madam? What's with this "zamindar's daughter"? Don't I have a name? What's my name? Gauri. Any writings recently, madam? A job has its holidays. But there's no rest for a writer's art or pen. Well said, madam. BANDALINGAMPALLI - HYDERABAD [breaks squeaking] Something on your mind dad? Nothing. Don't you dare say anything about me to grandfather. Is that a request or a threat? Grandpa's watching. Smile a little. Not feeling like it. [goat bleats] Grandpa! WELCOME TO THE DAUGH-- My dear, my sweety. Please stop that. When I asked for dad to come to Hyderabad... you wrote letters saying that he's not well. Coming to the topic of letters... does anyone in the world write them like that? "Any moment now it may stop stopping or cease its beating". "Any moment now it may stop or cease its beating." He's the one who told me to write that for the sake of rhyming. -Me? -Shut up. My own mother misleads me with these worthless deeds for her rhyming needs? Mom. That came out beautifully, didn't it? Yes. Write it down somewhere. Stop talking. And what do I see here? Dad's happily smoking his cigar like a chimney. And I came here challenging the editor saying he'll regret not making my job permanent. Is that so? What's your problem with him? "House and the housewife..." "Tricks for kicks" "Remove stain without pain." how many more years should I write the same shit? Enough of these itty bitty articles. I want to land the big ones. Cover news. Subedar Khanderao... My uncle. Subedar Maheshwar rao... -Subedar... -Madam. I know. Shut up. Yes, we've lost our wealth. But the history, it's still there. All I need is for the lawyer to tell us the good news. Glory days will be back. We'll hand out jobs. We'll never work under someone. You're earning some money and now you think you're above us. -Started taking on people... -You come here daring to offer my grandson a job. Get lost. He's a Subedar. I told you he doesn't work under anyone, didn't I? Yes, Ma'm, but... No buts about it. Rama, how's my saree? Look at it. She's asking you to look at it. Is it new? Mom. Is it new? We don't have a single penny. Our creditors are surrounding our house like wolves. I told you to stop these unnecessary purchases until we win the case. Tell that to her. She's the one who paid the current bill. Yeah. They would've cut the current if I didn't pay. I'm not talking about the current bill. Is it about the saree? Would you have used this tone if your father were here? -He's roaming around on his pilgrimages. -No. Saree is good. Good material. Hand woven. Two for two hundred. Brought them. Good job. [music playing on radio] [pump hisses] -Will this machine know my BP? -Hmm. Grandpa. Is that scooter your's? -Yes. That's mine. -Yes, it's his. All he does is clean and wash it. Never takes it out. What's it to you if? My scooter, my wish. I never take it out. Grandpa... This is what BP is. Your's is a bit on the high. Now that you're here it'll be alright. I want to announce my doctor grandson to the village. Get dressed up. Dad! Dad! Come over. -I told him... -Shh... [whispers] I told him I would show him the village. What? You can show off your village later. Come quick. Ask him why he's here. Why do I have to ask? He came to see his grandfather. Dad, you're not understanding. The last time I was here... ...you said the ruby ring suits my index finger. -Where's it now? -Yes. Where's it? He took it. Ok. Let that go. About the mother's pearl necklace you hung around my neck? -Where're the pearls on the necklace? -He took them. I've been watching him all these years. All he cares about is himself. The rest of us are secondary. The reason he's here... Be quiet. What happened? Come over here... He's mad about money. He burnt all the money without heeding anything I said. They learnt about him in the hospital he works. Do you know about a doctor's licence? Yes. They took his away. Do you know what this means? This means no one will take him into their hospital without a license. And he can't put up his own practice. He did all this? Yes. Why did you think he's here? -Because he loves me. -Love? No love no dough! Is the tree doing good with the tamarind, dad? We should make some chutney Tamaraind? Isn't this a guava tree? He negotiated a deal, they said the license would be his if he can give them five thousand. He knows I don't have that money. Nobody who knows him will give him money. Almost all of his ways are blocked... and he's got only one way out. He remembered you. That jerk! He'll try to sweet talk you with motivational crap. I think he's after your pension. Don't even think about handing over your pension money. I'll handle the rest. Dad. See you. Take care. I'll take care of grandpa. Don't come. I'll visit you Don't even write me letters asking for money. I'll tear them up. [vehicle honks] All: Our forefather's sweat shouldn't go to waste. The Subedar name should always shine. Why are you standing still like a statue? Light the diya. Open the box. She never pays attention to what I say. If we don't light it will our fortunes melt away? Or will lighting it bring us riches? Is anyone in the village foolish enough to loan us money? Then why should we do this bloody ceremony every friday. It would be a miracle if doing pujas is all one has to do to get money. What's with the negative attitude? The lawyer called me today. To talk about grandfather's land. Once I win the case I'll pay off all my creditors. That's unlikely. He told me he's got good news. Did he now? Must've got some monetary needs. Stop scolding the lawyer. Such a good honest man. I wonder why he's called. You go on Rama. Your grandfather is a great man. He killed a tiger. I know grandma. Pay your respects. He bought that land by killing a maneater. Go and bring back prosperous news. What did he topple now? Didn't I tell you not to touch the beds? How many times do I have to tell you not to let him in here? If you bring him next time, I'll break his legs? -Ma'am. Where's Gauri madam? -She's inside. I'll give this letter to her. A letter? From where? Prathibhimbham Printing Press. Chikkadpalli. Hyderabad. That must be from the editor. Read it out. Let's see what he's written. I don't think we should do that madam? What do you know about paternal pride? You are a childless unmarried guy. It's not when you have a daughter... but when the world praises her you get proud. No need to mention my bachelorhood madam. Ok. I'm reading it. Stop your work for two minutes and listen to this. This is about Gauri. Read now. To the honorable Dora, We got your letter. When we learnt that Gauri left Hyderabad... ...we can't overstate the emotions we went through here. What happened? Read it out loud. I can't read it out. What? What happened? I'll explain. Dora. I got your letter. When we learnt that Gauri left Hyderabad... We were relieved. We felt that the magazine is finally about, to see its glory days and we're working with renewed effort. That's the effect of Gauri's writing. Forgive us. It's regrettable that your health isn't well. But for the well being of our magazine this letter has been written. When Gauri wrote about kitchen dishes... we got the scalds from our readers. Her home recommendations resulted in death threats to us. In sensational news... the news should be sensational not the writing. We aren't brave enough to say this to her face. So we leave it to you. "Mission Kitchen..." "Idly medley..." "Chutney sambar..." we can't print these. We don't need her services anymore. This letter is to tell you that she's fired from her job. If god forbid she decides to come here even after reading this letter, you'll learn the news of our magazine folding down in another magazine. This is our respectful and deferential warning to you. What's all this? I too am wondering about that madam. She's the heart and soul of that magazine. Give me that. Who's this idiot? If Gauri ma'am reads this. She'll bring down the roof on us. If the dora reads this? He'll marry her off right away. That's why... As I was telling you about that... What happened? Nothing. What happened? What's that in your hand? A letter. From where? I told you she would ask. I told you she would ask. Tell her. From the magazine's office. Is it? Give me that. I'll read it madam. Honorable Dora, Honorable Dora, Honorable... What do you know about paternal pride? You are a childless unmarried guy. It's not when you have a daughter... but when the world praises her you get proud. I'll read it. To the respectful, honorable and divine Dora. What should I say about Gauri. I'm speechless. She's a boon to our magazine. Her writings are the lifeblood to us. That's why, until the dora's health gets better... We are appointing her the rural correspondent. We're also making her job permanent. Until she resides in Bandalingampalli, we request her to send us over the stories and news there. Yours truly, editor, Prathibhimbham. One only gets valued when they are far away. I'm always there in front of them. Never have I received such praise. Now the moment I land here this letter comes. I knew they liked me, but not this much. I can't believe this. You should madam. You should. All these days I thought it was my job. Now I am saying this to you this is my responsibility. Seenu. Roam the village and bring me good stories. Mom. Get my room ready. I'll begin writing. One story. One story is all I need to show them. Stories won't find us... We need to catch them. A great journalist needs a great photographer. Yes, ma'am. Here, take this and click some pictures. Me? What do I know about this Ma'am? I'll tell you. So, grandpa... I didn't tell you the reason why I'm here? Lakshmi. That cow needs to be tied up before it eats up all my hay. No beard trimming until you pay off everyone. The beard is getting lusher by the moment and we still owe everyone. Spare me five thousand. Grandpa, spare me five thousand. So, you're saying I'm getting nothing. I'm prepared to sell off Bandalingampalli on the market for five thousand. Our case is coming to court next week. This is exactly what you told me last week. Last week... There's a job in the cinema hall. Will you do it? How do I look like to you? No way. Anyway, will the hag let me? We need a story that will make all eyes turn to Bandalingampalli. Not one I'll tell you ten, ma'am. We had to do a critical operation one day All the junior doctors were terrified. There is no one who has guts to do it. I was the one who went in to do it. Seeing that Dr.Hariharan, Who is big doctor in Madras... Do you know what he told me grandpa? "You're a gifted doctor. There's something in your hand. Dr Anand use it wisely" and he handed me his stethoscope. So even this is not yours? PRIMARY HEALTHCARE CENTRE Finally we caught him. We keep giving him money, He keeps asking more. Why are you all afraid? Do I look like an idiot? Do I look like an idiot? [chicken clucks] Do I? No way. You are Moustache Saidhulu and I'm Moustache Samba. No way this will come to a conclusion. I've brought the buffalo. Should I make him ride it? Wait. I'm not done talking to him. Talking won't do anything. He's taken money from half the village. The buffalo. Wait, Samba. I'm ready to land some blows on this scoundrel to get my money today. When will he give me my money? He will. Ramarao. When will you give them their money? What about buffalo? Please be quiet for a second. The buffalo? Shut up and get lost. Go. Speak Ramarao... The lawyer said that my case will go to court next week. I'll pay off everyone then. I've heard this tune before. You've lost all your fortune and are too proud to do a job. Subedaris. -Where will the money come from? -He will. I'm saying this. Trust me this once. Ramarao, you will, won't you? Trust me. Got no money but false prestige. Come on, guys! [temple bell rings] My grandfather used to say to me... He's giving me a heap of credits instead of a fortune. I thought he was joking then but he truly turned me into a beggar. You said something about a lawyer and case in a week. What's that? My grandfather's thirty acre land. The case is running in court. Once it comes to me I want to sell it off and start a business. I didn't like the way they treated you Rama. Can I call you Rama? You can. You had a need and you took money. No need to cause all that ruckus. When you are a part of a village it's common. Rama, who's that watching us? You don't know him right... He is the most famous one in the village after our Dora. They say you're a doctor. How do you know? In our village news travels fast. Doctor Anand. Subedar Ramarao. Rama. I didn't share this with anyone till now. Even with my grandfather. You're the first I'm telling this to. You know why I'm here Rama? Why? In our village, for all of us, I want to start a clinic here. A clinic in my village? Our. A clinic in our village. Think about it. But the money to start the clinic. Money can be easily arranged. You used to have so much of it. Now you have none. We'll get it in the future. Won't we? Yes. Yes. It's not money... ...it's an idea that determines success. I have the idea. Do you know what is the most important thing to run a successful business? Demand, supply, demand, supply. It means, if we start a clinic in Hyderabad we will have the same ailments and illnesses. But we need to search for patients there. Here, I'm the only doctor. Patients will flock to me. Demand. Supply, Demand. Supply. You're right. In our village whatever the Hasthavasi (fake doctor) says is trusted. It would be better if someone starts a clinic... No, if's about it. Say, we will. We will. Where do you want to set up the clinic? I've decided on the site. Where? Near the bandstand. Where near the bandstand? There's the bandstand... Yes... Going straight from it you come to a tree... Yes. The tree... To the right of the tree... To the right... The tiffin centre... Yes... In front of it we have the closed primary health centre. We put it there. I saw it while roaming the village. [clicks tongue] [clicks tongue] What does he mean by that? That health care centre has a history. Nobody goes there. It's been closed for fifteen years. It's your village correspondent Seenu. Should I start Ma'am? Go on. Ranganaikamma's second daughter-in-law is pregnant. She sent her daughter in law when she gave him a girl child. Her son went to her and started a family there. In a way that's what led to the pregnancy... What next? Venkataiah's buffalo gave birth yesterday. Oh God! The calf has five legs... People from all the surrounding villages are flocking to see it. You are telling me these stories, sensing my compromised state, aren't you? Didn't you like them Ma'am? The chicken stealer Raju... Stop! Stop right there. Is this news? Is this the news? In Hyderabad we have thefts, protests, revolts, fights, lottery tickets, hunger strikes... lemon juices and sometimes murder to spice things up. This is all an average magazine reader wants. Yes, ma'am. Don't move. Don't smile either. It's tough writing news in Hyderabad with all those things... Here things are how they are the previous day. What's there to write about here? There's one thing. I'll tell you if you won't get angry. Tell me. It's all the same shit anyway. An old Telugu teacher who's only speaking on Tuesdays. Lord Hanuman came into his dreams... he stopped talking the rest of the week's days. What's the teacher's name? Sudarsan Rao. Is this the one with a slightly deaf left ear? It's fine now. He's put in an ear machine from the city. How do you know this Ma'am? He used to be my Telugu teacher. When I was little he gave me ten out of ten for an essay I wrote and signed Devulapalli Sudarsan Rao under it. It's been a long while since I last met him. Let's go, meet him and write his story. That's the spirit, Ma'am. Let's go tomorrow and talk to him. When we go, let's take a a few writings of mine to show him. What's the need for all that now, Ma'am? It's the least I can do for that old soul. He'll be happy. If you say so. Madam is the real soul and heart of Prathibimbham magazine. That article on 'Kitchen war' took... How many months? Full two months for completion. Everyone in Hyderabad read it. You know Venkataraju Dora... she's his daughter. How's it, sir? Normally saying something is meaningless tripe is a criticism. But this is something that goes beyond ridiculous, falling into the senseless. 'Father-in-law, finlaw...' 'Merry-go-round, merround...' 'Sweet tooth, stooth...' Why did you perform this unholy marriage between the words To start a revolt in the language? "Pighowling." Adjective. Adjective. It's not an adjective or noun! This is a blight on literature. This is an unrelenting and almost illegal attack on Telugu. You said someone actually published this. Prathibimbham... If someone published after reading this Either he's a moron or a generous man. Tell me if he's visiting this village. I'll pay my respects. You said she's the Dora's daughter. What's your name? Gauri. Gauri? Gauri Venkatraju. That's it. Your name is Gauri Venkataraju, they published it because you're the Dora's daughter. Or no one would do it. Sir, haven't you re-- What you're saying isn't the truth? 'Even a tremendous rain can't wet the sky' remember that. What's that? It's not the meaning but the tone of my voice you've got to understand. Only Gauri. No Venkataraju attached to it. What will you do if it gets published? No way. Due to my old age I'm feeling weak in my knees and losing my hearing. Hope my eyesight had dwindled too... Would've been spared reading this shit. There's no rule everyone should like everything. What's that ma'am? I said, there's no rule saying that everyone should like everything. That's exactly right Ma'am. Literature is subjective. It's fine if he hates it. But who's he to declare that no one will ever like it. Who doesn't like your writings Ma'am. He's gone mad with age. He's my teacher. Him liking my writings is equivalent to me winning the Sahitya Academy award. He used to be kind. Must've forgotten me. I need to remind him of who I'm. Yes. How should I do that? How? He should understand what they say about me in Hyderabad -and how important I'm to my magazine. -How ma'am? That letter. What letter? The letter my editor sent from Hyderabad. He'll realise after seeing it. Let's take it to him. Yes. Let's do that. Where did you stash it Madam? Think. It should be here somewhere. She came inside... I got lost in other things and I forgot where I put it. You don't remember? If Gauri madam sees it then... Don't frighten me. It's hard to recount the history of this clinic Then don't. Rama, shall we go in? Go in? Where? This pigheadedness is why you lost your licence. What license? Rama. He's an educated fool. What happened to your brain? I'm not listening to anyone. I'm starting the clinic. We're starting the clinic. Right here. What if they won't allow this in the village? Why won't they allow us? We are doing them good by starting a clinic. Hyderabad? It's someone I know. He'll give me money without thinking twice. Hello. It's me, Anand. Listen to what I've to say. One minute... Hello. Vishakhapatnam? Nalgonda? Vijayawada? Kurnool? Guntur? Tirupathi? Let me tell you a story, Rama. Two slipper salesmen roaming villages finally stopped at a village. Nobody in the village had the habit of wearing footwear. The first salesman left the village, saying that no one would buy his slippers. But the second one thought that because no one here wears slippers his trade will be good and put up shop. I'm the second type. No question of leaving what I've started unfinished. We've got nothing else to sell here. We've spent everything. Then listen to what I say. Sell off that necklace. We'll deal with what happens later. There'll be nothing to deal with later. She'll skin us alive if she knows. You'll only do a job if Grandmother allows you to. You'll marry me off by selling grandfather's land. Will you never do anything by yourself? Anand. I really liked the slipper story you told me. I will keep having the same problems. Look, from today I'll stand for myself. Let's bring in the necessities for the clinic with this money. Did someone lend you this money? -No. -Then? Don't worry about the money. You look after the rest and we'll share the profits fifty fifty. Fifty fifty. I'm keeping all my troubles in your hands. Promise me that you won't leave the village before setting everything right. I don't care about promises. I'm standing in the flesh right in front of you. Believe me. Rama, even if it seems heartless I'm going to say it because the situation has arisen- 'I promise that our clinic will be jam packed with patients before long, or my name isn't Doctor Anand.' That man sitting over there with the dot on his head. That's the hastavasi(fake doctor) Sir, he's Anand. He's the one starting the clinic. He'll heal any ailment of anyone with a single talisman. Let's see how you can start the clinic.. No way we should allow him to put that clinic here. Be quiet for a minute. I said I'll see to the matter. Namaste sir. Namaste Are you the grandson they speak about? You look good. Married? So, what's the trouble? The village clinic... I'm saying... Let it go. Even if we allow it, he won't. He's afraid that your clinic will shut him down. Let it go. But... Don't drag it out. It's a rat eat cat and cat chase dog world we live in. Let it go. -But what I saying... -No, man... He is educated and doesn't know, but what happened to you? Let it go. It's not good for the village. No one will explain this better. You're one of us. Do you have your own house in Hyderabad? Nothing. My brother is looking for a match for his daughter. Trying to set her up, what do you say? Let it go. He'll let it go. He'll let it go. He won't let us start the clinic. It's done. They can try but they won't stop me. [radio frequency buzzing] Listen one listen everyone. Come along come along. Think twice and lose it. Chance of a lifetime. A clinic in our village. Our very own clinic. Don't trust the Hasthavasi's (fake doctor) treatments A talisman won't treat your ailments. Fever, headache, cough, whatever the illness... I've got the cure. Clinic grand opening on Friday. This friday. Where? In the primary health center that's been shut down for fifteen years. The people who want to be there come along... the people who don't want to be there come along anyway. You have got nothing to lose. Everyone is welcome. Come along come along. FRIDAY. OPENING DAY OF THE CLINIC. [radio frequency tuning] Aakashavani news. The largest spacestation that's been sent into space, SKYLAB. Because of unforeseen complications, a tragedy has occurred. It has shattered into approximately 500 pieces... and is hurtling towards the earth with speeds exceeding 2000 kms per hour according to NASA. [infant crying] Come fast. [percussions] It's not too late yet. Don't put the clinic in that place. You, dad and the whole village couldn't stop me. Nothing is impossible to a passionate heart grandpa. -What do you say, Rama? -That's right. We're starting a clinic. And before we knew it we had five thousand in our hands. That's it. [percussions continues] Why are you standing outside? Come in. Crowd: We won't come, you go. -At least you come in. -No... You go first. Weak of heart? No need to be afraid. The future looks bright and shiny. Come in. What happened? Nothing happened. -Both: Nothing will happen. -Blow the shehnai.

At least you come. Let's light the diya and start the puja. [chants] What's all this in the morning? It seems Dora has mistakenly killed a cat somewhere. It's the cause of his illness. How does one go about accidentally killing cats? Oh God! I can't take it anymore, Seenu. You take care this, I'll leave now. Tell me once this is over, we will go to the Telugu master. -Okay, ma'am. -Did you find that letter? No, Ma'am. I'll search for it. [chants] [radio frequency tuning] According to NASA, there are high chances of Skylab falling on South India. [untuned Shehnai playing] Hey, leave this, let's go in. -Ah? -Come let's go. Come in. Come in. Come in. [thuds] [door creaks opens] -What happened? -Nothing happened. -Nothing happened. -Nothing happened. Both: Nothing will happen. Come in. Gauri madam is coming. [music mutes voices] -Lemonade? -Lemonade? Lemonade? Kid, lemonade? -Gentleman, lemonade? -It's all good days for the village now. No need to fear. It was in the center of the village and nobody noticed it. The doctor noticed it first. Lemonade? [untuned Shehnai playing] Lemonade? Didn't I say no glass should be empty? Nothing happened. Nothing will happen. [playing drums] Listen one listen all. Something called a SKYLAB. They're saying it will fall from the sky onto our village. Don't come out, lock yourself inside and don't roam outside. Say your last prayers and enjoy the rest of your lives... as they are saying it will destroy the whole village Live free and live true these last of your days. Lemonade? Lemonade? Lemonade? Dora. You'll be fit as a bull from now on. You'll live a full hundred years. Dora, they're saying something is falling from the sky, and everyone will die. [well tuned Shehnai playing] [birds chirping] Skylab is the biggest space station sent into space. The space station, which is revolving at a height of 276 miles, has fallen to a height of 242 miles. It is expected to fall even more. The honorable Chief Minister has said today that, the news about skylab falling is factual. [music mutes voice] Such a precious necklace. Vanished just like that! Are you asking me? How would I know? It's all bad! Real bad! There's something falling, what's that? Satellite, grandma. Satellite? Means? It means... American's space station. Space station. What's that? Space station means... It's tough to explain. You're confusing me. They're saying something else in the village. What? You mean Skylab? Yeah. Skylab. You know what Skylab means... Nine stories high, seventy tonnes. Is that true? I read that in the paper. It says Sky. And it says lab. Means it's a lab in the sky. Is that so? They built one in the sky? They went all the way up there as if There is no place here It's all bullshit. We're bound to see something so huge in the sky at least once. And who built it there? Day labourers? The American is a crafty one. He's the one that goes to the moon... We're the ones that suffer the consequences. Things built in the sky are bound to fall. Wonder why they took such a stupid decision. Will everyone have your wisdom? These sort of idiotic actions lead to the end really. I thought "building castles in the air" was a saying. Never thought it would be our death sentence. Will we all die if it falls? Stop fear mongering. Is everything the radio says the truth? No way it's real. Looks like a dot in the sky. And as it approaches it will enlarge into a seven storey building and fall on us. Do you think it will fall? Do you think it will fall? Skylab. Will we live if it falls? We'll die if a falling coconut hits our head. And this is something falling from the sky. We'll become pancakes. What's to become of our children! Their futures! Why don't you take a LIC policy? Shove the policy up your ass and leave me alone. I told you a thousand times to not put the clinic there. You didn't listen. Now see what happened. What's with the hard stares, Rama? You didn't heed what we told you. Rode a rickshaw and announced all over the village! Where should we go if skylab falls on our village? Where? A village has it's customs. A panchayat has its traditions. You cut through all that and put your clinic there. Look what happened. So you're saying our clinic... ...is the reason Skylab's falling. Did you have a sunstroke? Did you? What's the connection between my clinic and Skylab? There's always a connection. Always. You guys don't understand, the clinic was put there to help us all. Even he's speaking up. How would we know such a thing would happen? You won't pay the dues but would start a clinic? Subedari heritage shows. Yeah what? -Listen to me. -Just wait and see. What? What? -I'm not afraid. Give me my money. -What money? -Hey! -I won't pay. -Hey! -I won't give! -The buffalo. -Both of you ride it. What? They're saying that it's falling. I'm not committed to any god, demon, any person or any loan now. I'll not pay you. What? The topic is being diverted. Talk to the elders. They put up the clinic and so Skylab's falling. Because of them. Yes. No one went there for fifteen years. Did anything bad happen to the village? No. No one opened its lock for fifteen years. Did anything bad happen to the village? No. Nothing happened all these years. And now on the same day, down to the same minute, You opened your clinic and Skylab is falling. What do you say? How can I answer that? [scoffs] We may be uneducated, but we sure know a hell of a lot. Do I look stupid? Yes. You are stupid. Stupid. Buffalo. What should we do now? What should we do now, Hastavasi? We should tie some divine amulets to the doors, say some prayers and shut the clinic down. No one should step into the clinic from today. Also... ...the buffalo ride around the village. Shut up with the damn buffalo. What do you plan on doing after the ride? What? Make you pay a fine. Yes. A fine. A fat fine. Crowd: Pay the fine. Crowd: Pay it. Pay the fine. Because you went against the village elders and opened the clinic, You should pay within two months the panchayat 1116 rupees Good. That's it. We shut the doors with a proper spell. I did the proper pujas. I mixed the nine spices with cow urine and sprinkled it all around the village. Nothing bad will befall us now because of the Skylab. Stay brave. Skylab won't fall on our village. Mom, check if I've got a fever. No. Can I believe this? Or is this more deception? You don't understand, it's him... Ma'am. Please don't. Then, does this mean I've lost my job? Good riddance! Dad! I'm this close to losing it. Stop talking. Please stop! Should I ask your father to speak to the editor? That's a NO. I understood that. I won't speak to anyone. It's good she lost her job. What's the need? We have everything made for us and she decides to pursue a fool's errand. The whole village has gone mental over some Skylab And she's gone completely mental in here. I hear someone calling me. I'll see to it. I too hear someone. I'll come. Where are you headed? What happened? [radio frequency tuning] Skylab... Skylab... Skylab. It's all everyone is talking about-- Ma'am are you thinking what I'm thinking? I'm thinking what you're thinking. We found our story. SKYLAB. They can fire me, but they can't stop me from writing. They can't. Pantulu said that I got published only because I'm Dora's daughter, didn't he? Watch as I prove him wrong. All these days we thought this village is barren of good stories. But now it's not any ordinary Bandalingampalli. It's the Bandalingampalli Skylab is falling on. Every house will have a story. Watch me as I write. Did you hear about Skylab? It won't fall here, Priest said it'll fall in North India. All the key decisions and important things happen over in Delhi. So, it won't fall on our village Where's America, and where's Bandalingampalli? No way it will fall here. I thought the same thing yesterday. But I found out something yesterday. What? Forget about it. Why speak of such things in our last days. Last days? Last days! What's all this, Rama? They're saying it's nine stories high. Where should I get the money for the fine from? It's the way they asked me that's truly infuriating. As if we owe them. Skylab. They're saying it's eighty tonnes. Maybe I'm the last Subedar in my family tree. Is it! That's what they said on the Radio? What else did they say? Yesterday I spoke to someone I knew in Hyderabad. That's when I learnt. What did you learn? Skylab is falling here. What do you mean "Here"? "Here means... Here" On our village. They asked if I noticed any changes in the village. I said i didn't. These days the dusk is coming early to the village. Right! That! Changes. Come forward and state your name. You continue madam. Rama, can't we do anything? You were the one who spoke of firmness in one's belief. Your grandfather's is firmer than our's. Get lost! The pieces of Skylab will fall over an area of 1734 acres, NASA said. 1734 acres. That's seven and a half kilometers of area. 1734. Did you hear it anywhere? No. Never. You know the entrance to Bandalingampalli. The board? Yes. From that, to the other end of bandalingampalli It's 1734 acres. That's not fair. Which means... It will fall on us. That's what they said on the radio. It will fall on us like a fireball from space. We are done for. They're saying it'll fall on us. They're saying it's nine stories high. 80 tonnes. Like a fireball from space spitting fire. It explodes into 10,000 pieces. Even if one piece of it falls on us we're done for. We're done for! Damn that skylab! What have we done to deserve this? It will wipe us off the map. Skylab. Skylab. Skylab. Skylab. Skylab. Skylab. [chaos] Not the Hastavasi. Call the doctor. Some miracle should happen. This is the end. This seems like it. Who's the doctor here? Move aside. [clears throat] What happened? Stop looking at me. Look at them. He kept saying the word Skylab and he fell over. What? He kept saying the word Skylab and he fell over. Skylab? Rama. This is the miracle. This is the only way to reopen our clinic. They won't listen to reason. Look over there... This fellow realised he needs us. Now we should make sure that the whole village feels this need. Rama. This is the village that tried to scam me off money. Watch as I fleece off five times more from them. What do you say? Should I let it go? No. Don't let it go. Don't. Why? Take me to the clinic. The BP is high. Everything under control. He's really weak. Everything under control. He'll be fine under supervision. But he... Take him to the city hospital. Why? You have your clinic in the village. Where? You shut it down. Open the clinic. Should I open it? Yes. Don't open the lock. But do whatever you like on the premises. Rama. Shall we? Here one hear all... Because everyone is fearing that Skylab will fall, if you feel any rise in BP... if you feel feverish... ...have trouble breathing... ...you know where the clinic is. The doors will be open for you. Me and Rama waiting there to welcome you. You just come to us and we'll look after you. Instead of dousing the fire you started... ...this fellow just threw more firewood in it. [music] "SKYLAB TERROR STRIKES" "MENACE IN THE SKY" Why are you looking at me like that? You are my first patient in the village. How much? Thirty rupees. I'm asking about the fever. Thirty rupees. Wait. I don't have money on me right now. Keep my Meena with you. I will take her back once I can pay you. If you can't pay up? Then you can look after her. She's as much yours as mine. What should I do with this goat? Not just a goat. She's Meena. She wrote a piece to the magazine a couple of days back. The magazine comes today. We're waiting to see if she gets published. Seenu! It didn't get published Ma'am. [applause] Hmmm...I look good in the poster [whistles] Greetings to the assembled. You bloody dunderheads. Your fright has pulled me all the way over here. Forgive me if I don't greet you by name. I don't trust my lungs or my memory to do that. Skylab. Bloody thing. Some bloody asshole sent it and it's falling on us. If anything should fall on us, it should be sent by us. [crowd applause] [whistles] My leadership sent me here, to reassure you people that skylab won't fall on us. And here you are refusing to be reassured. I say don't fear it and you're still losing your mind. They're not listening to this. I know how to deal with them. Skylab, Skylab, Skylab. Will it fall or will it not? Will it fall or will it not? Should I tell them? Yes It will fall. It will surely fall. Where will it fall? Right on our village. It will fall on you, on him and even on me. "40 MORE DAYS" "40 MORE DAYS" Thirty rupees. What happened? My waist thread sir? Bring it down. Down! Thirty rupees. What's this? My grandfather gave my father this and my father passed it on. This has such a rich history? Three generations worth. They're saying Skylab's falling. Money's useless. This will come handy in the mornings. "30 MORE DAYS" Don't have. Don't have? Don't have or won't give? Don't have and won't give. Didn't come even today Ma'am. Andhra Bhoomi, Andhra Pathrika, Vishala Andhra, Praja Shakthi... post it to all the magazines Seenu. Andhra Bhoomi, Andhra Pathrika, Vishala Andhra, Praja Shakthi... it didn't come in any of them Ma'am. "25 MORE DAYS" FOR SALE - SKYLAB AMULETS Wait! Don't shove each other. There are no more insurance policies available "20 MORE DAYS" Thirty rupees. Thirty rupees. Cut it from the amount you owe the village. I will cut you... Stop, stop. What village is this, Rama? Should we include the Dora's name and send it as Gauri Venkatraju, Ma'am? No. Just Gauri. Even if it won't get published. Old suitcase, second hand utensils, leftover heirlooms, pumpkins, chickens, flea bitten cotton, mouldy vegetables, and all this other shit. You said you'll get that five thousand from this village by any means. What happened to that challenge? Is this a clinic or a village retail store? NASA released list today naming The countries that skylab could fall on America Canada Spain Portugal England France Italy Switzerland Austria Czechoslovakia Belgium West Germany Poland Pakistan India these countries are likely to be most affected by Skylab. SKYLAB HOLIDAYS All they have to do is nudge Skylab a little towards Pakistan... ... and we'll be rid of both Skylab and Pakistan. It's like killing two birds with a single stone. And no one in the ruling party seems to think of such a simple idea. Banner: Radio Stations should work ceaselessly. "10 MORE DAYS" "Skylab mantra" "5 MORE DAYS" Post! For your friend, from Hyderabad. Where is the village doctor off to this morning? To pay his fine? Know what this is? My doctor licence. My licence has come. My contacts worked. Money always works. Thank you.Thank you. Wait a minute. Who payed them? I didn't and dad won't. Nobody else knows about this licence thing. Grandpa? They're saying it will fall on us. I saw no other way to get rid of you. That means your pension money... Your doctor licence. You turned it all around in a single day Grandpa. That's it. I'm done with this village. The minute I stepped down everything went to hell. You warned me of it, but I didn't listen. I'll run off a cliff gladly before coming back here ever again. Anand. The kid from the temple's pond. He doesn't listen to me. Jumps in that pond every day. Stubborn kid. Collecting the coins from the pond's bed. He brought this fever on himself. How's he now, Sir? He'll be fine. I'll write the medicines. How much will it be, sir? Thirty rupees. Thirty? Okay Sir, one minute. I can't reach it, will you help me? Why son? Why keep going in after your mother tells you not to? Look how much this affects your mother. It's for the kid sister in my mother's tummy. To buy her something to play with. That's why I'm collecting the money. Mom doesn't know this. There's no money in the house, sir. If he learns that I took it from this he'll raise hell. That's why I called you aside. Don't mind that. Take it sir. He'll be fine, won't he? If we get any illness or pain... Now that you're in the village, we feel a little reassured. That hastavasi doctor won't treat us. To take one's pulse the doctor should hold the patient's wrist. Will he touch us? Seeing him like that made me afraid for him. Your hand cured him. He's good now. When're you leaving? To Hyderabad. The letter came to the clinic first. I forwarded it to your house. I waited for you to say it to me. But now I can't hold it in any longer. I wanted to tell you, but... It's good to leave if you plan on doing it. It's a small village and you get bored looking at the same lanes and same faces everyday. It takes time to get familiar with this village. And it's better that you should leave before the villagers become familiar with you. What should I do then, Rama? I came to this village to earn some money to get back my license. It's been six months now. I can't stay here doing nothing... Like me. You can't stay here doing nothing like me? You said to believe the man, not the promises. Now you're going away. The money I owe still weighs on my shoulders. He used to own a coconut shop by the temple's side. He used to stay home to look after his pregnant wife. When the pains started, the hastavasi and the village women gave up saying they can't do anything. He hired a wagon and started to Karimnagar. But on the way... They said it was a girl If our..." my" village had a hospital... If my village had a doctor, she would've been eight today. Have a safe journey. You're right. If Gauri wasn't Dora's daughter even these wouldn't have been published. All this time I thought I was a great writer, He and my mother played along. You were the one who told the truth. I can't do this anymore. "I never tried to search for divinity in a man, or to search for humanity in a god. My search is always for a kind look and a warm smile... I wrote this. But this never got published. I never got the chance. But you do. You have the chance. What use is it to write now? The whole village is freaking out fearing Skylab. No one will read it. A good story will find its audience. Also, don't write because someone will read it. Write it because you love to write. You know when a story becomes yours? When you are in the story. Where are you in this? Where's Bandalingampalli? Where are the people? You frightened the people saying Skylab will fall on them. If they believe you, they will tell you their stories. Why should they trust you if you frighten them? Skylab is falling and this is the last story you write. What will you write, and how will you write it? Someone asked me recently what I would write if it is going to be my last written piece. It took me all these years to find out that I have no story of my own. If it falls, and we all die, I'm afraid I will remain in my father's shadow being remembered as his daughter. I thought about it all night long and realized something. What if we don't die but live. I wondered what I would want if I lived. I want to write. Stories, poems, and so many other things. Even if they don't get published. They should remember me as someone who tried. What do you want to do? I came here to listen to you. That's all. What do we have? There's so little. Whatever it is, tell me. That's all right. Is it OK if I take a photo? Ours is a huge family. On my mother's side there are seven brothers and a single younger sister. A total of nine siblings. Big family The groceries in the house wouldn't be enough to run it. I remember my mother making huge quantities of curries in a large basin. The whole house used to be so cramped and stuffy. That's when I married him. We're just three members But sometimes I find myself thinking that the house is a bit too empty.. They say Skylab is falling and I want everyone to meet up one last time before it does. All these years I used to carry the news around the village... If I was given some money or a drop of toddy. But I want to shout the news I really love at the top of my lungs before I die. Eyes that contain the universe in them... A visage that holds the gaze of any observer. I kept hearing of the deity in the temple from my childhood... But was never granted permission to see for myself. If it really falls on us, I want to see the deity inside before I die. Latha, she works at touring talkies in our village. I want to watch a film with her. The poems of Kaloji... Mera Jootha hai Japani song... Barsaat cinema... ...Raj Kapoor and Nargis, this was all she knew. During our fifty years of marriage... the one wish she asked of me was to take her for a ride on... my scooter along these roads. When she was with me it was merely a wish. Now that she's not here... It became a memory. I clean and wash it everyday. But I can't nerve myself up enough to take it out without her. I can't. [sobs] Gauri Journalist, Prathibimbam [On Radio] An important announcement. [On Radio] About Skylab's falling and its consequences, the central government is talking to the experts at NASA. Officials are saying that they are working to avoid any losses due to this situation. The chief minister is requesting the people... who live in huts to move to more sturdy shelters like local temples. [On Radio] He also requested people to stay far from explosive materials, Where are you off to? [Radio] and not to breathe in toxic gases that emanate from Skylab's fallen parts. You don't know where it'll crash, so where will you hide I say it's better to die in company than miserably alone Also who said it won't fall where you are escaping to? [On Radio] The CM Marri Chenna Reddy also requested the people to stay alert and to not come out of their houses. Where's the tumbler? Is this a house or a market? Are you drunk? No. Tell the truth. I promise on Grandma that I'm not drunk. You'll likely kill me with your lies and promises. Don't involve me. Did she eat? No. No one is listening here. Bring that table here. Remove these What're you doing? Did the lawyer tell anything about the land? Why are you removing those? If she mentions Subedari now... You're a blot on the Subedari's name. Brother, she said subedar. Did she say that? One more word and Grandfather will shatter into a thousand pieces. I've got something to say and you listen without any interruptions. If you say Subedari or mention the tiger killings, Grandfather gets it. What did you give me? What? You ate away at all the money and siphoned off more from the village. All you gave me is the credit I owe around the village... ...and the useless tail of Subedari. I got frustrated with my life and started a clinic with a guy called Anand. Now, if I were to tell you that you'd say NO. You'd say that's beneath us. We're Subedars. That's how you are. Did you ever pay Ramana for his work. For name sake we're subedars. They're laughing at us out there. They're talking about rides on a buffalo. I'm dodging everyone right now. You used to pray to that necklace all day. What happened to that? Where is it? I sold it off. Would you behave like this if your father was alive? He's happily on a pilgrimage and you're talking like this to us. Someone goes on a pilgrimage for a week, a month or a year. He's vanished in his pilgrimages. He's walked off on your constant pestering. There's nothing more demeaning than living off one's past glory. If that Skylab falls on us let's die with everyone else. If not, then let's live by our own work. Put a garland on that. Aakashavani, news with your beloved Prayaga Ramakrishna. The officials at the space organization say that Skylab will fall today. In New Delhi, the police and fire fighters have been put on emergency standby. All states including Andhra Pradesh have started to take precautionary measures. To ensure that everyone escapes the danger... All the major temples and mosques are holding special prayer services. The chief minister has ordered his officers... ...to be alert to people's needs during the crisis. [goat bleats] What's the matter with you people? Don't you know that not everyone is allowed inside? Don't you? They're telling on the radio to take shelter in sturdy structures like temples. What do they have to lose? They'll give such harebrained suggestions Which will lead to such things falling in the first place. Do all the fingers on a hand look alike? That's true. But all these are something we set up for ourselves. Will Skylab care about all this? [clinic announcement] What's that? Nothing ma'am. It didn't come even today, right? That's all right. The only thing is I can't stand the look on my father's face... ...when he learns that he won and I lost. Anyway, that'll always be there. We found so many stories on one visit to the village. All that bounds us is our imagination and our ability to write. There're stories all around us. If not today then... What happened? Nothing, Ma'am. What's with the smirk? What's that in your hands behind you? What! Did it come? Not in the back, Ma'am? The magazine's name is Pratibimbham. The true heart and soul of the magazine is our gauri Ma'am. Ma'am are you thinking what I'm thinking? I'm thinking what you're thinking. Take out the car. Let's go to the Pantulu. Did you clean everything up? Yes sir. Did you send down all the necessary items? Yes sir. I don't know how long we've got to stay there? He won't be able to hear that, Ma'am. [door creaks open] He saw the magazine. Seenu. Even if Skylab falls today, I don't care. Don't say that Ma'am. I'm not married yet. Give me the keys to the car. Why? Hand them over. No, no no. That's Dora's bed. He'll raise hell if he sees that. Get down. No. Get down. Go and call your dad. Where are we going Ma'am? Shut up and stay that way. Dora will scold us if he learns this. Let's go home. Why did you stop here, Ma'am. Go inside. Let's go to the house, Ma'am. Go in. All we ever believed in was... that our problems wouldn't last beyond today... there's always a better day tomorrow. Now they're saying that there won't be a tomorrow. What should I tell him now? There's no cost to dreaming. One should just close their eyes. I will show you. Close your eyes. Close them. With dal, curry and ghee, let's dream that he'll never know hunger. Let's dream that he'll get a proper education. Let's dream that our son wouldn't know the hardships we are so familiar with. Hey! Hey! Driver! Chinna! Chinna! Mom! Mom! Where's she? She's there. Let's go. I thought you left for Hyderabad. I never searched in vain for godliness in a man or for humanity in a god. All I want is a kind glance- a smile, that recognises a man for a man. Can I tell you a tale, Rama? A couple of shoe sellers who were roaming villages to sell their wares... ...stopped at a village. Nobody in the village had footwear. The first salesman saw that nobody used his product and left in a huff. But the second one- he saw the need the villagers had for his product and set up shop there. I'm the second type. I will not stop until I get what I'm after. In Bandalingampalli, people are looking up at the sky in either fear or wonder. Maybe when the end is near, we get a fresh perspective on what is and isn't ours. That's what happened in Bandalingampalli. For a while everyone stopped looking at caste, religion or other divisions. Fear became everyone's identity Divisions melted away and the hope to see another day came to the forefront. In a way, the fear of death made life worth living They are saying Skylab will fall on July 11th These few days These few hours Let's not dwell on the wounds life dealt us Let's not fret over what the future holds for us This day...This moment, is ours Skylab may fall Governments may collapse Crops may sprout or wilt Many more disasters may be waiting for us But let's keep our desire to smile intact No one can wipe the joy off our faces [radio frequency tuning] Aakashavani, news. According to news we just received, the biggest space station sent into space... Skylab is expected to fall in the sea. NASA is assuring us that loss of life has been averted due to this. NASA also reassured India is safe from the danger. [radio turns off] Why did you switch it off? If we tell them they'll come in. Let's wait for a few more moments. 1979. Neelam Sanjeev Reddy decided to start Mandal commissions. Vijayanagaram was recognized as a district in Andhra Pradesh. Mother Teresa received the Nobel peace prize But she's still standing outside offices asking for donations. 1979 has one more significance to it... That's what this story is.
