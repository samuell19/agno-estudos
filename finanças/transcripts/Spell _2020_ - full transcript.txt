Marquis! There you are. No! Dad! No! No! Please! Help! - Marq! - Babe? - Babe? - I have been pounding this door for the last ten minutes. There's something wrong with the knob. Yeah, it's jammed. What did you do now? Marq, don't start with me. I am late. Just break it down. This a Belgian, imported, $1500 door. There is no scenario short of fire or global catastrophe in which I'm gonna use my foot to kick down a $1500 door. - I don't care how much the door costs. - $1500. - 1500? Just break down the door. - Uh, I'm gonna go call a locksmith, okay? - No, wait, Marq! You break down this damn door! - I'm gonna be right back. Right now, or I swear to God! - Marq! - I'm on the phone right now, okay? I'm talking to the locksmith. They said there's only four people ahead of us. - Be like three hours. That's all. - Marq, come on! This is very important. I can't be late for this meeting. I'm sorry. I'm on the phone still, okay? So I can't hear you. Marq? Goddamn you, Marq. What? I mean, hey, hey. Will you marry me? Marquis T. Woods, I hate you. But thank you for rescuing me. Anytime. I love that butt! Fight. I want to fucking fight. And when I say "I", I mean you, my messenger of fucking doom. Marquis T. fucking Woods. My personal goddamn gladiator. But has he lost his bite? Don't think for one second, that just because the majority of the plaintiffs in this case happen to be "my people," that I don't plan on taking that ball straight to their end zone and cramming that ball down the throats of their attorneys. And that doesn't bother you? Bother me? Though the plaintiffs are black, their attorneys are white. Correction: lily white. This is a class-action lawsuit of some public delicacy, so we must deal with it delicately. Why use fists when we've not yet exhausted words? You're right, Marquis. As always. That's why I love you. Except I don't do it for your love. No, Wyman. I do it for your money. Cha-ching, dear friend. Mr. Woods, an Otis Peeley, Esquire, on the line for you. Don't know if I'm familiar with an attorney by that name, Peeley... - What does he want? - Family matter, he said. He's calling from Kentucky. - Put him through. - Yes, sir. Transferring him now. Good day, Mr. Woods. Thank you for taking my call. I'm afraid I have some bad news about your father. He's passed away. I sure am sorry to give you this news, but you are listed as the next of kin and there are matters of his estate that need to be resolved. You don't talk about him very much. What was he like? Ah, you know, I haven't seen him since I was a kid, baby. Not since I ran away from Appalachia and didn't look back. Let's say... he wasn't a kind man. Just... stuck in time a little bit. It'll be good for you to get this closure, Marq. This place sounds more than just a little stuck in time. They even got electricity out there? - Elec-what? - And indoor plumbing, right? They even got black people? Okay, that's enough. This man was your dad's father. So, this weekend's pickup game, workout, dance class, hang out with your homies, whatever it is, deem it canceled, because we are all going up there to pay our final respects, and that's all there is to it. Okay, change of subject matter. Ty, let's talk about this kid that's been bullying you at school. Huh? So, Ty, tell me what's going on. Social media shit, Dad. You wouldn't understand. I think I do understand quite well. Look, always remember, you talk to your teachers, but whatever you do, don't fight. That's just what they expect from us. Now, you see, baby? That was easy. It's beautiful. What do you say we listen to some music? Any requests? Anything y'all want to hear? Not hear? Sam? Ty? All right. Ah! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Kids, I used to sing this to your mama. Yeah! Sing it, V. ♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪ Ah! Whew! Son, ladder. The big one. Diesel. Gotta love it. Dad, how did you even know this place was here? Well, son, they got apps for everything. I bet this place doesn't even exist on a map. Look, real talk, your pops is a straight-up bush pilot. I could navigate by using the stars if I had to. And this plane right here? This is what we call old school. - Right, baby? - Damn, it is hot. Okay, this was nice. I'll be in the plane writing in my journal, if anyone's looking for me. - I'm gonna hit the head. Anybody need anything? - Mm-mm. Are you kidding me? Whoa, shit. Dammit... Hey. Yo, brother, any service around here? Slavery times is over. Pump your own damn gas. Oh. No. Let me see. - Uh... - Damn, I ain't gonna steal it. I just wanna look at it. Hey, a mojo bag. I ain't seen one of them since I was a kid. But even then, I wasn't too sure what it was. Luck, man. - Luck. - Yeah, luck. - You ever heard of it? - Well, sure, I heard of luck. - Protection? - Protection from what? From folks looking to conjure your ass. You must be rich. How much that cost you? I... I don't know, really. You got it, but you ain't know how much it costs? My, uh... My dad bought it for me. Shit. There we go. Let's see there. Okay. And you can keep the change there, Pop. Oh, and I need the facilities. I gotta take a leak. Privy's out back. With a quarter moon on the door, right? It's been nice, uh, talking to you, getting to know you. You have a good day. You ain't headed with that airplane up into yonder foothills, is you? - Yeah. - And you ain't wanna be taking a mess of these along with you? No, I'm cool. Thank you. I don't believe in that stuff. Suit yourself. - Can I have my phone back? - What's up with your hand? Oh, this? Busted it playing ball. Funny thing, though, after it healed? Boom, Steph Curry all day. Jump shot's money. Damn. He really do have one. Huh. Fuck that. So what y'all doing up around here? Funeral. My grandfather's. I never met him. I ain't heard of no one dying around here. No, further up that way. Yeah, I best be gettin'. Before them fish quit to jump. And next time you want some service around here, get you a 5G phone. It's been years since we got 4Gs or 3Gs around here. Country-ass nigga. What? What did you just say? I do not want to hear you use that word again, do you understand me? Yeah. I mean, Dad uses it. It's every other word on his playlist. Please. I am talking about "country-ass." Don't do that, hating other black folk. At some point, we were all country. I do not want to hear that word come out of your mouth. - Yes, ma'am. - Damn right, "Yes, ma'am." Now get your sorry ass back in that plane. Now you know there was no way I was gonna let my delicate derriere touch that. Let's just get going. Oh... No, no, you gotta be kidding me. You just... just hang tight. Be cool, okay? Open the door. Open the door. Good day to you. I'm aware that the civil aviation code here in West Virginia stipulates that it's legal for any private jet, single engine, to land on any open strip of landing area, private or otherwise. Baby, you wanna? The paper states it right here, sir. Here it is, right here. Well, legal or not, don't get much plane traffic through here. Thought I'd stop by and make sure everything was copacetic. So, where y'all headed today? Cypress Ridge. Well, if there's nothing else, we'd like to get on our way. Obviously, there's a big storm a-brewing, and I would just like to get my beautiful family up top before that hits. "Y'all have a nice day." All right, y'all have a nice day now. Tydon. - I say something? - No, Sheriff, just kids having fun, that's all. You understand. Well, I hope everyone enjoyed their first brush with the local color. Dad, seriously, this place is a creep show. Come on, Sam, it ain't that bad. I bet there's a million billion inbred hillbillies watching up at us right now. Stroking it. And I ain't talking no banjo, Sam. Tydon, I have had just about enough from you today. Is something going on? So what happened? What did he say? It doesn't matter what he said. Kids, put your headphones on. I said put your headphones on. You want me to land the plane, pull off my belt, go 12 rounds with the kid like my dad did? Is that what you want? Of course not, Marq. But the way you treat them, they're becoming entitled jerks. Give me a break. Because I give my kids what I could never have? And you turned out just fine, Marq. Veora, I didn't turn out just fine. Okay? If I had my way, your son and daughter would spend their lives in a boardroom, not in some jungle that I couldn't get out of fast enough. Except sometimes, Marq, that jungle comes back to find you, no matter what boardroom you're hiding in. - Whoa! - Dad? It's fine. Stay back there. I've flown in this before. Everything's cool. Dad! Dad! Mayday! Mayday! Take the knife! Take the fucking knife, Marq! Only cut them at the throat. Veora? What the fuck... What the... Where am I? Well, well, well, well. Look at what the cat done drug in. Mercy. All right, come on. Let me get you on back up on that bed. What? Where? Where am I? - Where am I? - Up in my attic sewing room. Only suitable room around here that wasn't already took up. Now come on, come on, get on up. Ma'am, I just want to know how I got here, where my family is. Young'un, you been rode hard and put up wet. Now you get yourself up on that bed, all right? All right? And then we can talk ourselves a spell. No, no, see... no, I don't need to go to nobody's bed. I just... I need to know how I got here, where the hell I am, where my goddamn family is. Oh, no. Earl! - Earl! - What? Now if you gonna guest in my attic, get one thing right from the start. Vain naming the Lord in this household? Oh, no! Earl! What you hollering at me for, woman? You know I got me a bad heart and a mess of bad innards. Don't be bad-innarding me. I got a serious problem up here. - What, he causing him a ruckus? - No, mister, I was just asking... I'll pitch a fit of my own, he don't get himself back up on that bed. You do look like you could eat corn through a picket fence, though. Yeah, he a big old boy, too. Mm-hmm. Too much for me, anyhow. I'll fetch Lewis up. Lewis? No, ma'am. Ma'am... I just wanna know where the hell my family is? Lewis don't talk much. Some people think he's slow. But trust me, there ain't nothing slow about Lewis. Hey, what's going on, man? Hey! - Hey! What? Whoa! - You calm yourself down. You calm yourself down. - Damn it. Hey, man! - He definitely needs to calm himself. No, I don't need to calm myself. Just need to know where the fuck my goddamn family is. - Oh! Lord Jesus. - Boy, you was in an accident. - Don't you even remember that? - Accident... Mayday! Now rest yourself back on that bed. Oh, my God. So what about my family? I got a wife and I got a daughter and a son. Have you seen my family? Wasn't no one in that mushed up old plane but your own self. Oh, no, no. No, we gotta get 'em. - Hey, man! - You got some of that good rootwork, Ellie? Earl, you know I do. And if he can't calm himself, I'm sure the good Lord will be okay if I went on and did it for him. Hell no, I don't need that. I just need... What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Oh, no! I tell you, I'm gonna cook you up one day. Ah, you lookin' good, Marquis T. Oh! Long fever-sleep. Poison in your blood, I suppose. Had to put those on you too, 'cause you was just clawing at your face so bad. Oh, goodness. Oh, come on. Must have been one powerful dream. - Come on, get up. - Hey, Ms. Eloise, come on, sit down here for a minute. Ms. Eloise, I'm begging you. I just need you to help me. - Ah. - What I really think I need is just an ambulance. Ain't no hospital within 50 miles of here. I'm talking about money. I mean it. I got all the money you could ever want. - Oh! - Cost ain't no object. So, I could pay you gladly for any ambulance service to come here from however far, it don't matter what, whatever it takes, just so a proper search team can come back, look for my family. You understand? I'm trying to find my family. And if you could kindly walk me down them steps of yours, then I'll use your phone. I'll use your telephone. I'll call on my own. I mean that. Mercy. You gonna learn, if you live long as me, money can't get you everything, especially a telephone when you ain't got one. You're telling me you ain't got no telephone? Mm-mm. Supposed to be bringing people together. Well, it ain't nothing but just the tools of the Great Divider. No! Now I got a little something here that'll help you get better. This is my latest and greatest Boogity. What is that? A Boogity. You ain't ever heard of a Boogity? It's one thing standing for another. Now this, it stands for you. And the more it resembles you, with blood and nail clippings and hair, a pinch of semen... ...then, the more it is you. The more good things happen to it, the more good things happen to you. Oh, a Boogity's a kind of folk magic, like a rootworker, a fixer. You know how, when people say, "I'm gonna fix you, I'm gonna fix you good," that's what a rootworker do. Mojos, potions, charms, tricks. Oh! Son, you looking at a straight-up, bona fide, back-in-the-hills rootworker right here. Oh, yeah! Let me show you. I put you up, I put you down. I put you sideways and I spin you around. And then, see, I'm gonna put it over here, in this here window... ...to look out. So it can see when help is gonna come down the road. Salt. Yeah! Marq, the devil can't come in here and get you neither. Have a real good rest, Marquis T. Woods. Okay... Let's go. Yeah! All right! All right! Who wants a visit from the Ole Hoodoo Ghost? 'Cause I got that good rootwork that y'all come for, whipped up special for you today. Special, y'all! She's got that good rootwork. We using animal parts tonight. But when that blood moon come, we gonna fix you up real good. Hush up now, Earl. Who's ailing? And what about you, Lorraine? Is you ailing? Come on up here. - Yeah! - Come on up here. Earl, catch that old tomcat. Take his tongue and put it in Lorraine's Boogity. And then save those eyes for me later. Ooh! Speak, woman, for you are healed! Speak, woman. Speak up now. Say them words. Come on, now. That darn cat ain't got your tongue no more! - No dang more! - I can talk! See that! She's cured! Now, we ain't done yet! Whoo. All right! Lewis. Fetch that goat. Now, Julius, here, he ain't been able to see since he had his accident. Come on. Come on up here with me. I need you to take those cat's eyes and put them into Julius' Boogity. Now, Julius, if you had eyes, you'd be able to see. But you don't have any eyes. We gonna fix that. Earl, get those goat's eyes and bring 'em here to me. Yes, yes, yes! Lift your head for me. That's good, Julius. You want to see. You want to see. Now tell us, Julius, - tell us what you see. - What you see, Julius? What you see? Him. Folks, we'll be right back. I don't think he could've gotten out. Let's go see. Lewis! Come! The window's open. Yeah, I needed some air, Ms. Eloise. That okay? You soaked plumb through. You wasn't out in the rain, were you? In the rain? Oh, come on, Eloise, you kidding? You know, I just ain't thinking straight. I'm worried about my family. Anything special catch your eye when you moved this curtain? Like... Like what? Oh, I don't know. We were having ourselves an old time revival and I just thought you might have caught yourself an eye-full. I can't imagine what a city boy like you must have thought about that. By that, you mean, what, like faith healing? Something like that? Well, sort of. Only instead of the Holy Spirit, we use the Boogity. Remember what I said? Come good to the Boogity, come good to you. Hmm, like, sticking chicken legs in a doll till a paralyzed man can walk. Oh... You just started sounding like them folks that don't believe nothing unless they can see or touch it. And with all due respect, Ms. Eloise, you're starting to sound like my father. Trust me, I've done met my share of spiritual people in my day, sure have. All I'm saying is all of that, I don't know, all of that mojo, maybe it's just psychosomatic. Like somebody can believe in something so bad until it physically becomes true. I mean, come on, you don't really believe in all that stuff you been talking, right? Guess I have to. We don't have much in the way of Obamacare around here. Ms. Eloise, I didn't mean it like that, okay? Of course you did. You a city boy. Of course. You better than all of this. You hear me, boy? You think you're better than me, boy? - You just like me, boy. - No! - Got that anger in you too. Can't escape it. - No! Just like me. Hey, where you going? Come back here, boy. You're gonna see! I see you done worked yourself up into a sure enough appetite. Ah, it's so good, Ms. Eloise. Hey, look, uh... I've been meaning to apologize to you. Sorry about what I said yesterday. I didn't mean it. I just really miss my family. - Ah, I know, baby. - Last time I was up here, it was with my pops, - and he just wasn't... - He wasn't one to spare the rod. I saw those scars on you. Yeah. Well, let's just say I done spent the last 25 years... trying to build a very different life for myself. Well, can't never could. You can't expect a soul to be able to change the way he or she thinks, you know, overnight. Which is one of the reasons I said you've gotta keep your strength up. Let me get you another helping. Now I do like a man with an appetite. Oh! It means you're getting stronger. Well, it sure is good, Ms. Eloise. Say, Ms. Eloise, when I was waking up... I don't know, it sounded like I heard like a ping. And then I heard it again. Oh, that was probably just me ringing the chow bell for Earl and Lewis. Yeah, but it kinda sounded like the ping that comes, you know, when a cellular phone gets a message. Ms. Eloise, somebody could be looking for me. Oh, well, that would be a "I do declare" miracle, seeing how there ain't nothing like that in this house. I done already told you that. You did tell me that. You did mention that. Um, I guess maybe just a fever dream again. - What you got going on there? - Oh, just casting the bones. You know, you throw them to tell your future. - What's it telling you? - Well, it's telling me it'll probably be around the blood moon when you get all that poison out of you and you see your family again. I can see it right here, as clear as day. And that blood moon is only a couple of days away. Ooh, come on. - Try throwing them bones. - Who, me? - No, come on. I can't do that. - Come on. I know you got that old-time slave magic in you, Marquis T. Oh, can you hear that? That's your ancient self. Your better self is calling you. You know, you like Lewis was. Uppity house Negro. - Had to be brought down a peg or two. - Oh, come on, Ms. Eloise. Oh, yeah. You like him. You may live in the city, but you ain't from there. You from this land and everything that empowers it. This is the blood that's running in your veins, giving you your true life. Ms. Eloise, why are you telling me all of this? 'Cause, baby, you somehow has forgotten, for a spell, who you are. Now, what do you see? All the wisdom of the universe is in these bones. Won't you play with them? Eloise, why do you keep locking that door, huh? It's for your own good. I'm on your side. What a crock of shit. Oh, boy. Help. Ooh! Oh, can't leave all this mess - just laying around. - Yeah. - Might stink the whole place up. - Yeah. Earl, that you and that old mangy bird again? I told you to put that bird in the root cellar. Got that old-time magic! That old-time magic! Earl? That you? Shut the fuck up. You old buzzard? Shut the fuck up. I don't know what Earl's been teaching you. You old raggedy rat with wings. But it's gonna stop, I tell you that. Earl! Earl! Get Lewis! Come back here, boy. What, you some kind of house nigga now? You're better than me 'cause you can read your fancy books and all? It's real, but you gotta believe. You're just like me, boy. You got that anger in you. You gotta believe or it won't work. Ah, the blood moon's tonight. You're gonna feel a whole lot better, Eloise. Fuck! Okay. Veora? Tydon? That old-time magic. Veora? Sam? Ty? Why are you doing all this, Eloise? Eloise. Earl. Lewis. "1860." What the fuck? What are you up to, you old crazy lady? "Blood moon. Transference of life spell." "Blood of my blood." Blood of my blood. "Seed of my seed." "Flesh of my flesh." Oh, my God. They're putting a spell on me. Gotta believe or it won't work. Come on, come on... Yeah. I fucking knew it. Ah, shit! Fuck, come on, come on. If I had known that Lorraine was gonna talk so much, I'd have never put a tongue back in her mouth. That woman can talk now. Ty's phone. Yes. All right... With all that cussin' you do, I'm gonna sew it up. Whoa... Marquis T., you awake up there? About time to get your dressings changed. Darn it, Ellie, did you leave the door ajar again? No. Sounds like something your old barren ass would do. What if he ripped that spike out? Been free-wheelin' all over the farm while we was gone. Well, we fixin' to find out, ain't we? Lewis, bring that ax. Might gonna have to chop at something else. Oh, fuck. Marquis T., you haven't been walking around here, have you? Oh, Ms. Eloise, no, no, no. - I just woke up. - Uh-huh. Well, we gonna have to look at that foot of yours. - Okay. - There, there. - Well... - Yeah, it's looking better there, right? That's what them bones said. It'd be time by the blood moon. Which is a total lunar eclipse, ain't that right, Mr. Earl? Yeah, if my memory serves me correct, that's tonight. Hmm, well! It looks a mite refreshed. Oh, ah, yes, it does. - Yeah. - I'll grant you that. - Uh-huh. - Okay. Well, you get your rest, since you're so close to all of this being over. Go on, Lewis. Oh, come on, come on. Oh, come on... Come on, son. What's your passcode? Birthday... 2-1-6. Damn it. Fuck. You're a 16-year-old boy, what could your passcode be? What would it be? Ah! Yeah! Yeah. Hello? Cypress Valley Police Department. Listen, I've got 1% battery left on this phone, okay? - So I gotta talk real fast. - Okay, now slow up, tell me what the heck's going on. We went down in a plane crash, all right? Next thing I know, I wake up in this house - I can't tell you where it is. - Hold up, you wouldn't happen to be Marquis T. Woods? Yeah, yeah. That's me. Do you know me? Know you? Mr. Woods, we spoke. I checked in on you at the gas station in Lemona. - Yeah, I remember you. Yeah! - I've been looking for you all week. Your wife and daughter walked into the police station about five days ago, - battered and bruised. - What about my son? - Oh... - What was that? Mr. Woods, I'm sorry, um, we have not found your son yet. Mr. Woods? Mr. Woods, listen, I'm sorry. Why don't you tell me where you are, and I can come get you, at least. Somewhere, in a house, with these old goddamn people. They're black, I can tell you that. Um, the woman is Eloise, they call her Ellie. I think her husband... her husband, his name is Earl. I do know an old couple who go by those names. I'm right by that farm right now. I'll come in. Now, you stay by that phone, you hear? That's it, that's it. Fuck. You got a big mouth, don't you? See and feel that? Hey, Sheriff. Hello? Mr. Woods? Mr. Woods? Mr. Woods, you there? Earl, get Lewis. Get Lewis! What the hell? What you doing? You okay? What the hell's going on? What... What? What you doing? - Are you gonna tell me... - Just drive. Sheriff, okay? All right, I'm driving. I'm driving. Now you gonna tell me what the hell's going on? I don't know. If I knew, I would tell you. - All I know is they were keeping me prisoner. - Prisoner? - Prisoner! Eloise and Earl! - Eloise and Earl? It can't be. - They're just the sweetest old couple. - They're evil. I'm telling you. Evil conjurers, rootworkers, backwoods fixers. And they ain't the only ones in on it. They got big-ass Lewis in on it. They got a whole cult of these assholes up here. That's what I'm trying to tell you. - A cult. Controlling people. - Controlling people? It's just that, at the head of the table, is crazy-ass Eloise. And she's controlling every single one of them. The freakiest-ass, Afro-Appalachian cult you done ever seen. Well, now hold up there, fella. I might not be too in-step with the times, but that sounds downright racist to me. What? Where are you... You and your bougie, pretty-ass wife just wouldn't listen to me. Go on. Get. Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you! Haul that uppity-ass city nigga into the barn. Thank you, Sheriff Pines. If you've had your fun, I think we can take it from here. That rootwork is starting to wear a bit thin. - I'd see to it, I was you. - Now don't you worry, Tom. I surely will. We gonna have us a special power night tonight. Oh, yeah. Everybody's gonna get a little piece of this. Lewis, go rustle up them folks at the McFarland farm. Tell them the blood moon is up. Ah! Veora! Veora! Sam! Ty! Hey, hey, it's Dad! They're not gonna hear you. I done told you, you gotta reap what you sow. Bring me... that big one up here. Fetch him up onto this here table. Yes! You think you're better than everybody else that's here, Mr. "Gotta See It, Gotta Feel It." Now, the only thing that might be better about you than all these people right here, - is this heart... - Yeah! ...beating right here in your chest! Yeah! And in about the next ten seconds, you ain't gonna even have that! Come on, Ellie. Bring it on home. Oh, Earl, now you think you're ready for all this? I'm ready, bring it home. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. You ready? All right, then. Uh-huh. Get Lewis! Get Lewis! Pick it up, and push it down. Then push the bad stuff in the good bottle. And the crazy old witch... All right, let me see you. Sam, let me see you. All right? Okay. And my boy, you good? Yeah, I'm good. Follow me. Where are we going? Marq! Okay, Sam, Ty, find whatever you can, put it in front of the door, so they think we're barricading in. - Come on, come on. - Okay. I need you all to get out. Follow the river. I found us a car, get us out of here. Hey. I'm sorry. You're all safe now. I'm gonna get you out of here. Jesus. Fuck. I tried to warn you. Why don't you come out and show yourself, boy? Huh? You want some? Come on and get it. Come on! Come on, boy! Where you at, boy? Where you at, boy? Come on! Come on! Get him, get him! Go get him! Go get him! Go. You get him. You get him, Lewis! You stay there! You get him! Lewis? Clever. Very clever, Mr. "Gotta See It, Gotta Feel It." I guess that's why I hide my Boogity, where no one can mess with it. Now, you see that, Ms. Ellie? That's why I made my own. Is that it? You're just gonna let an old lady burn? You taught me a lot, Ms. Ellie. And so did my pops. If it can keep the devil out, it sure as hell ought to keep you in. No! No! If you people get back, I don't have to use these Boogitys. Everybody get back. Let him through. Let him through. I put you up, I put you down. I put you sideways and I spin you around.
