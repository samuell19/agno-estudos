Save them. Save them. Holy Father, help me. Help me save the sluts and the whores from their unholy acts. Grant me strength... and I will deliver their souls unto you. Save them. Save them! Hey, Rick. How's it hangin'? Only you and Jimmy Dean would come to the prom alone, Brad. You got that right. Hi, Brad. Hi, Lisa. You look great. Where's, uh-- Larry? Yeah, good ol' Larry. Oh, he's off dancing with Louise. Really? I thought you two were, uh, going steady. No way! He only asked me to the prom because he thought he'd get lucky. Doesn't look very lucky. Why do you think he's dancing with Louise? Good ol' Larry. So, uh, what about you? I mean, who did you come with? It's not who you come with, it's who you take home. What was that for? What do you think? You sure we should be doing this? After all, this is school property. Don't sweat it. We're not in school anymore. Thank God. No kidding. Yeah. Hello, Larry. Hi, Larry. Enjoying the prom? Come on, sweetie. Yeah, you don't know what you missed. Not much. Good ol' Larry. Mm-hmm. You got a car? Mm-hmm. Wanna ride home? No. Why didn't you think of this before? I did. Often. I'm crushing your corsage. Mmm. Do it again. Am I hurting you? Shut up and take off your pants. Wh-What was that? What the hell? I'm the man. I'll go. Br-- Join your slut. Help me, Father. It's a plea to save the souls of the sinners. Help me, Father. It's a plea to save the souls of the sinners. Help me, Father. It's a plea to save the souls of the sinners. Help me, Father. It's a plea to save the souls of the sinners. Merciful Father-- - We have to move him to Saint George's. We did good work last night, Father Jaeger. Good work in the name of the Lord. You're an abomination, Father Jonas. Abomination. Don't touch him. Not there. He's too young. Look, Father. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding for all of you. So, where are they sending you? Africa. I fly to Khartoum next week. No second thoughts? None. I've never been more sure about anything. As long as you're happy. What about you? I'll miss you. You've been good for me. You know, I always wondered what it would be like-- Jennifer, please don't. Good luck, Colin. Doctors always try to prolong things. Silly fools. I've enjoyed our afternoon chats, Colin. So have I, Father Jaeger. You've prepared me for just about anything. Mm. I hope so. Father, I'm a little concerned. - Why is that? - Well-- I-I leave next week, and my final assignment still hasn't come through. In fact, my flight hasn't even been arranged. Is there some delay? Colin, sometimes we have to make sacrifices. Of course, Father. I've al-- I've had you taken out of the missionary program. I'm sorry. - But the program needs-- - The church has greater needs. I don't understand. That is Father Jonas. Why? In time. You must learn your duties first. The devil has taken him. He is beyond salvation. All we can do is keep the demon contained. He is evil beyond imagination. Hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Took Jeff's car this morning, and, uh, well, I kinda needed it at lunch. Can I have a sandwich? Where's your lunch? Jonathan forgot to make me one. I got another detention yesterday. Another one? For what? Leaving school at lunchtime again. How can you stand that place? It's like a prison camp. I know. Today I had to sneak out the side door and run for the fence. - Oh, boy. You better go to confession. - I will. I don't believe you. The nuns make me. They think I'm being corrupted. - Corrupted? Yeah, right. - It's your fault. My f-- I ain't even started yet. Hey, come on. You don't really believe that stuff, do you? The church has chosen you to succeed me as guardian. The care of Jonas will be your life's work. Protect the church... and reveal his existence to no one. If you notice any change-- if Jonas begins to awaken-- you must contact Cardinal Truent. Sister Amiel says she found you two-- during the lunch hour-- in the backseat of your car. It was your car? Yes, ma'am-- I mean, Mother Superior-- I-I mean, Sister? And was it during lunch? Yes, Sister. What exactly were you doing on our school property? Well, I-I came to see Laura and-- I'll tell you what you were doing... in the parking lot, in your car... in the backseat. You weren't driving. No. You were-- You were-- We were fucking, Sister. I can't believe you said that. Who cares? It was stupid. You shouldn't have said it. Don't call me stupid, and don't tell me what to do. Okay. Okay. Look, she's not going to do anything. I mean, the worst that'll happen, I'll get six demerits for being on school property... out of uniform. Was it worth it? Yeah, it was. Look, Mark and Meagan are going to the prom. Do you want to go with me? We got a really cool surprise cooked up. Yeah, I'd like that. Excellent! Hey, hey, hey. The ride. Hey. The church is very forgiving of its own. We tried to help him at first. But nothing worked. He became catatonic soon after we brought him here. The exorcism, the drugs and the treatments, they are the only ways we know to keep him that way, to keep Satan from awakening within him. We've been watching over him for 33 years. There is no other way. Hey, thanks for letting me sleep over. No problem. When are your parents back? Day after tomorrow. You think Mark would be going out with me if I still looked like this? No. But who cares? He likes you now. - Thanks a lot. - Well. Well, I think I need to lose another pound or two. Oh, yeah. Right. Where were you this afternoon? Oh, I had another crisis of faith. Oh, yeah? Did you skip mass again? No. I fucked Jeff, didn't feel guilty. Oh, well. I'll pray for you. Oh, don't bother. Dear God, please forgive me. I only pretended to enjoy it for Jeff's sake. Oh, yeah. I was pretending the second time too. Oh! You're awful! Watch it, Megs! Jonas? My name is Colin. I want to help you. Can you hear me, Jonas? Motherfuckin' priests. You should have married that whore, Jennifer. You fucked her enough, didn't you? But you weren't the only one. Jonas? Jonas? Hello? Hello. Is anyone there? Jennifer? I-- Who is this? Colin? Is that-- Okay. Now put your hand on her leg. Oh, yes. Okay. Okay, now take her shirt off. Undo the buttons. Yes! Thank you, God. Oh, no. Oh, no, don't stop. Please, just one more button. One more button. - Damn it. - I'm sorry, Mark. I'm just not ready yet. It's okay. Want a soda or something? Yeah. Thanks. Jonathan, you little weasel. What, are you spying on us? Yeah, what are you gonna do about it, big brother? Hello. Give me Cardinal Truent immediately. This is Father Colin from Saint Anthony's. One moment, please. Cardinal Truent speaking. Cardinal Truent, this is Father Colin. You must get over-- Father Colin? Hello? Are you there, Father Colin? Speak to me. What's happening there? What's going on? Father Colin? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Who is this? Hello? Speak to me. Father Colin. What's going on there? Answer me! Hello. Thanks for letting me borrow this. Oh, sure. I knew it was too big for me when I got it. Besides, it's more you. Wow, you're gonna look great. Jeff will just die. You're gonna look great too. I'm too fat. You're perfect. What are you doing? Mark's a lucky guy. Do you like me? Of course. You're my friend. Are you... attracted to me? No. Well, I'm attracted to you. - Laura, don't. - Don't you feel anything when I do this? Nothing at all? No. You must feel something. Even a little bit. I bet you do. Laura, stop it. I'm sorry. I read an article in some woman's magazine... about how to tell if your best friend is gay. You're so innocent. I couldn't resist. Got the booze? Check. Okay, got the hash? Check. That's everything. No. Let's just check on Jonathan. Oh, that's right. We'll make it quick. We have a long drive. I heard we might get snowed in up there. Yeah, if we're lucky. You just wanna fuck her! How you feeling, Jonathan? You gonna be okay? Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm fine. No, really. 'Cause I could cancel my plans still if you want me to hang around. No, no, no. No, I'm feeling much better. Don't worry. You go right ahead. All right. You sure now? Okay. Take it easy. Later, dude. Yes! My God. What should we do? Take him to his room. Make it look as though he hanged himself. I tried to contact Jonas. I did not administer an injection today. Idiot. I can't believe we finished 12 years of high school. Now that calls for a drink. Sure does. Here. Here's to prom night. To prom night. Prom night. To Jamie Lee Curtis. So, where you headed tonight? Your car break down or something? I can take you as far as Meadow Falls. That's where I'm going. I'm gonna get me some pussy. Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. I like to get laid on Friday night. Sort of leaves the rest of the weekend open. Right? Jesus, I love Fridays! I'm not Jesus. Quite true. Do it, Jeff. Come on. You gotta do it. Do it, do it. They're gonna love it. Come on. Come on. Go ahead. Do it. They're gonna love it. Do it, man. Come on. Hey, Jeff, how's it going? Jeff! Mark, make him stop. Come on. He's just expressing himself. Exactly. That's what I think of Hamilton High and their prom. So what did you tell your parents? We were going away for a weekend fuck. Hm. Is that what you told your parents, Meagan? No. I said Laura and I were going camping. Oh. - Dressed like that? - Well, they weren't home when we left. I hate lying. So, uh, where is this place that we're going? It's about an hour from here. My parents' summer home. Not that they're ever home in the summer. Oh, it's great. It's right in the middle of nowhere. Sounds romantic. Thanks, Ray. See you Monday. Just kidding. Come on. I'll show you guys around. Wow. What's that smell? It's just musty. The place has been closed up all winter. Oh, great house. Looks old. - Used to be a monastery. - Which order? - Order of what? - Monks. Beats me. All I know is the place used to be some kind of church retreat. It was abandoned. when my parents bought it. - Wonder why it closed? - Maybe the species died out. Monks don't reproduce. They must have died here. And recently too, man. Yeah, this place stinks. Let's check it out. - Oh! - Oh, what is it? Meat. I don't believe this. Somebody stole the goddamn freezer! Wonder what else they've taken. Oh, shit! Okay, they got the stereo, the CDs, the televisions, the VCR, the stove, the fridge, the microwave and the freezer. - We got a problem here. - Oh, it's not so bad. - Yes, it is. - Maybe we should call the police. We can't call the police because we're not supposed to be here, remember? Look, Laura's right, man. We don't need any of that shit. We're here to celebrate, so let's celebrate. I wasn't planning on watching any television anyway. Come on. We're here. Let's make the best of it. All right. We'll improvise. Let's see, some dried apricots, carrot and tomato juice, Chinese noodles, uh, dried mushrooms, can of asparagus and some spices. Look pretty fresh. How'd you do? Two cans of tomato soup, couple cans of Pepsi, some fossilized onions and a bag of rice. Just like home. We'll whip up a feast for the guys. Oh, how domestic. What? I like to cook for someone. Makes me feel like I'm married. What's wrong with that? You really like Mark, don't you? Yuck. I'm never gonna eat again. Oh, yeah? Guess Laura'll be disappointed. Well, uh, I take it back, you know. Well, you'll have to introduce Meagan to the experience. She's gonna think you're God. Aw, man. Oh. My parents are going to kill me. Hit the light. Jeff! What? Jeff! What a bunch of idiots. They didn't take any of the wine. It's worth more than the house. You mean they didn't take anything... yet. Uh-uh, no. Forget it. We'll never get another chance like this. My dad'll kill me. He'll never know it was you. He's insured, right? We'll start with a '57. - and then we'll work our way back. - Yeah. You sure you know what you're doing? Leave it to me. Hey. I'll go get some wood. Damn! Look what I got. For me? You shouldn't have. Hands off, it's for Meagan. No kidding. Figure, you know, since it's her first time, she'd wanna feel sexy. Think she'll like 'em? Like what? Uh, well, it was-- It's supposed to be a surprise. It is. No, Meagan, please, don't be mad. I'm sorry. I'm not mad. I'm going to try them on. Yeah, eh? Mark? Laura. God. Mark's idea. Uh-huh. That stuff just drives Jeff wild. God, you're so sleazy. It's great. So, uh, are you still a little bit scared? About what? Uh, the big event. Not really. Well, maybe a little. Don't worry about it. I think Mark knows what he's doing. Don't tell me that. I do not want to hear about how many girls he's had sex with. Thank you. You should get down on your knees and thank Jesus that one of you is experienced. There's nothing worse than two virgins trying to fuck. Trust me. Forgive me, Father, for how much fun I'm going to have tonight. Thought it was spring? Well, I got news for you, we're still looking at snow in some parts of lake country. Maybe some freezing rain by tomorrow. Here you go. Lucky boy. Thank you. Excuse me. Let's play a game. Like what? Charades? No. Confession. We'll all tell each other our deepest, darkest secrets. I don't even tell priests that stuff. Oh, no? What do you tell them? Lies. Laura, you shouldn't do that. Well, it's easy for you to say. Priests fall asleep during your confession. I could get into real trouble. Come on. You don't really tell them about-- My sins? Yeah. Yes. But you wouldn't really tell 'em about tonight? Yes. Yeah, but what about, say, what happens-- or might happen... later on-- you wouldn't really tell them about that. - Yes, I would. - Don't worry, Mark. She won't mention your name. If you're good. No matter what I did, I mean, even if it was something really terrible, I'd tell a priest. I'd have to. Well, amen to that. Amen to that. Come on. Just one little secret. Anything. I'm pregnant. What? Just joking. Oh, very funny. I'm gonna go get some more wine, okay? Okay. It's okay. It's me. It's Mark. Meagan. Oh, wow. You okay? Oh, damn it. I'm okay. Let's go upstairs. Okay? Yeah. Kinda looks pretty bad. I'll be right back. Yes, hello. Hello. I know who you are. I saw what you did. You're all the same. Who is-- You're a cocksucker and a fucking whore! It's too late for you now. What's wrong? I just got an obscene phone call. Yeah? It's probably just Jeff goofing around. No, it wasn't Jeff. It was really strange, Mark. I'm serious. Don't worry about it. Just some crank. Boy. This is gonna be worth a fortune. That feels better, Mark. It'll be okay. Sorry, Meagan. Make it up to me. Jeff, you're not asleep, are you? Come on. We only had sex once. It's not like you. Who's there? Meagan, is that you? Jeff? Wake up. Wake up. Who's there? Laura! Laura! Laura, open the door. This is not a goddamn spectator sport, Jeff. Yeah, well, you should see it from up here. Look, Laura locked me out of the bedroom, all right? Probably your technique. Oh, you're hilarious. You got a key? - No. Now fuck off. - Thanks. Maybe there was something wrong with her. All right. I don't understand it. I went downstairs to get some wine. When I came back, the door was locked. I don't know what gets into her sometimes, you know? See? What the hell's the matter with you? You know what those two were up two. Everything was going fine. Just relax. We'll find her. She's gotta be around here someplace. She can't leave. No car, right? Yeah, I guess. Laura! I don't understand this. We'll check downstairs. I'm sure she'll show up. All right. I'll look around up here. Laura? Laura! Laura. Laura. She's crazy. What does she think she's doing, hiding? I don't know. - Go check the wine cellar. - You're coming with me. - No way. I'm not going in there again. - Come on, Meg. Forget it. We've got to find her. Just go. Okay, okay. Be careful, Mark. Blah! Laura. Laura. Laura? Are you in here? Laura. - Find anything? - Just a sec! - Mark, are you okay? - You wait there. Laura. Laura. Meagan! Laura? Laura? Laura. Laura? You had me worried there for a while. It's nice up here. I like the candles. It's kinda cozy. Are you okay, Laura? Laura. Laura. We gonna fuck now, Jeff? Repent, he said. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth... as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. - The candle's still warm. - Maybe Laura was down here. Yeah, right. She hacked a hole in the door without us hearing it. How could she possibly know about this place? I didn't. It's blood, Mark. I don't like this. Something's happened to her. Laura. I wonder if Jeff found her. Laura. Laura. Hey, Jeff! Jeff! Jeff. Laura? Where are they? I don't know. And who was walking around upstairs when we were in the basement? Like I know. Maybe somebody's playing a joke on us. Not like this, Mark. Laura wouldn't do this. It may be about that call. This is really weird. Okay, let's check the attic. Laura! What the hell are all these candles doing here? - Mark-- - Shh. There's blood everywhere. Jesus. What's happening? I'm scared. Call the police. No. I have to find out what's going on. Don't-- Mark. Mark! I'm going to check the woodshed. - What are you doing? - I'm coming with you. - No, you're not. You're staying here. - I'm not staying alone. It's probably nothing, Meagan. Laura! Laura? Laura! What the hell's goin' on? Laura? Doesn't look like there's anybody out here. Mark, come here. Look. Laura! Oh, my God! Laura! No! Damn it! We have to get help! Where? This is the only place in 20 miles! We gotta do something. I'm gonna call the police. I'm sorry. There's no 911 service available in your location. Please try your local police department. Come on. Operator. Yes. Get me the police. What area are you calling from, please? I don't know what area. Um-- Christ! Near Turbin. That's it-- Turbin. I don't care. Just get me the number. Yeah! Meagan! Meagan, run! Get out! Get the hell out of here! Run! Get out of here! Run, damn it! Get out of here! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My boots. Yes? This is Officer McBride. We got an emergency call from this number. Can you verify there's a problem? Yes! Yes, I made that call! It's out of your hands, Officer. It's in the hands of the Lord now. Meagan! Meagan! Meagan. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. The penance is death!
