Why would you turnyour back on me whilei'm talking to you? The same reason youturned your back on mewhen we were married. You see, things like that... That is exactly why thingsdidn't work out. No, they didn't work outbecause you didn't try, Jay. No, things didn't work outbecause we were youngand needed to mature, which I see you'restill having a challengewith right now. I'm done talking to you. Well, that's just great.Then it's settled.Zoe moves in with me. No, she doesn't have to movein with you! She has a place. Can you guys explain to mewhy in the world you twocan't just... I don't know, what? Get along? Look, it's this simple. Mom, I love you, - but I'm movingin with dad.-All right. And dad, I love you, too, but, you know, I'm 16, and you can'ttreat me likea child anymore. I'm a teenager.I have a boyfriend. His name is stonehenge, and you're probably notgonna like him, so there. - Stonehenge?-mmm-hmm. So, that meansyour boyfriend's namedafter a landmark? (Laughing) no... More like... More like a wonderof the world, because he issimply wonderful. - Just...- (chuckling) Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.Thank you for sharing that. You see, this is whyshe's moving in with me. You let her get awaywith way too much. You know what? If you think you can doa better job, have at it. - Please!-okay, okay, dad... Dad, dad, dad, can you just let me talkto mom for a second, please? Please? - All right.I'm going to get a refill.-Okay. Mom, come here. Come here. Okay, so, you knowi love you, right? Mmm-hmm. Well, if you love me so much, then how come you're takinghis side? I'm not taking anybody's side.I just think it's timei live with him for a while. You did just get remarried, and you need time withyour new husband. You know, not to mention, experts do say thatthe newlywed phase is very important fora successful marriage, so... - What experts have youbeen listening to?- (Chuckles) The ones on reality tvthat the housewivesnever listen to. Zoe, I told you aboutwatching that mess on TV. Mom, I have learneda lot of valuable lessonsfrom reality TV. Really? Like what? I don't know.Like, you know, like, gossiping is bad. - Uh-huh.-and not everyone who saysthey're your friend really is. Wait a minute.I, your mama, taught youthat stuff, remember? Yes, yes.But I'm your kid, so you don't really, like, expect me to believeanything you say, do you? - (Laughs)-I'm serious. (Chuckling) i'm serious. - Your father can be sucha stubborn jerk sometimes.-Come on, mom. You know I don't like itwhen you talk about dadlike that. Well, I'm sorry if you don'twant to hear the truth. Well, then, how could youfall for such a stubborn jerk? It happens. Then how am I supposedto know it won't happen to me? Zoe, now, look.You don't need to worryabout that right now, okay? - You're too young.-Okay. You know, mom, i really don't think dadis that bad, and he has alwaysbeen great to me. Well, he has. He has been.I'll admit that. So, I mean, if he isany of the thingsyou say he is, let me just find outfor myself. All right. If you really wantto stay here, i will allow it, but it's only gonna befor a year, and thenwe're gonna re-evaluate next year based onwhat those gradeslook like. Mom, you are just actinglike dad is gonna let merun wild. - (Sighs)-you know, if you thinkhe is so bad, why did you marry himin the first place? Oh... 'Cause he was in a band. - But that's beforei exercised good judgment.-Okay. Stonehenge is in a band.He's actually the drummer, so... And that's exactly whyyou're not gonna date him. - (Groans) mom, can you...-Oh, no! This is who you wantto live with. Listen, baby girl.Guys in bands are bad news. Okay, but you werein a band, weren't you? No, I was more in, like, a rap group. - Wh...-what? - Okay, so, that's worse.You know that, right?-What? No, we were a clean, wholesome rap group. Your name was, mc pesticide! - (Both chuckling)-That's because I was, you know, - killing all the unwantedpests in the streets.-Okay. That's right.Don't act like... - Oh, so now yougonna act like you don't know?- (Laughs) Yeah, it was a metaphor. Okay, so, did "metaphor"mean, I don't know,"corny" back in the '80s? It was the '90s, and I was the bomb. Okay. The bomb? Okay.Okay, dad, you are reallygonna need some sort of... Dictionary to helpyou translate all ofyour old-man "metaphors." Old... old man? Okay. I'm just kidding.You know, I'm just... I'm gonna go unpack. Oh, hey. Hey.Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Aren't youforgetting something? Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, daddy. Thanks, mom. All right. Stonehenge. (Groans) Listen. I appreciate you letting hermove in with us. - I'm only agreeingto do this...-And... and... Let's kind of agree tonot argue like this, all right? She begged me to stay here, which is the only reasonwhy I'm agreeing to do this. But what I can't figure out iswhat the sudden changeis all about in her. I don't know.Maybe she just missesher father. No, that ain't it. I mean, why now? Jasmine, you didjust get married, right? Maybe she really does wantto give you some space. Jay, you've been involved, but I have raised zoefor the last 10 years, - and I know my daughter.-Our... daughter. - Our teenager.-Hmm. Oh, yeah. Just wait. - It's not as easy aswhat you think.-Hmm. She has a curfew, and I don't want youbuying her a car. Whoa. What? (Stuttering) who said anything aboutbuying her a car? - She did.-What? (Chuckling) you have no idea whatyou're getting into. I love it. (Beat boxing) - (Laughs)-don't stop. - (Chuckling) don't...-Bye, Jay! Try to front on me. (Beat boxing) Yep. So, I'll be goingto north side next year. Yeah, I knowit'll be weird not seeingeveryone, but hey, life is supposed to beabout change, isn't it? Yeah. - What's up?-Uh, excuse you. - (Sighs)-can I call you back? Okay. Can I help you with something? I believe it's, "may I helpyou with something?"And yes, you may. Okay.what do you want, Wesley? Look, I know we're gonna behousemates now, so let mestart by laying - some ground rules, okay?-Oh, ground rules. You know what? I think that will bea great idea. First things first. Do not enter my roomwithout knocking. Well, if youwant some privacy, then close your door. Open door is an invitation, all right? Rule number one. My friends... They're my friends, okay? You cannot dateor hang out withany of them. Okay. Why would I dateany of your loser friends? See, I have a boyfriend. Cool. Good. Perfect.Even better. Okay, and you can't talkto any of my friends, not that they woulddate you anyway, so... I'm good. Now, look. School is like Vegas.What happens in Vegas, it stays there, okay? I've got a really good systemworking here.I don't want to ruin it. Well, neither do I. Look, I know howbaby sisters can be. Wesley, I am one year youngerthan you, and since boys matureat half the rate of girls, then technically, that wouldmake me five years older. - You got any studs over there?-Why? - I lost my nose ring.-Oh, no. You are not putting my earringin your crusty nose.Buy your own studs. Come on.I need one tonightfor the lockup. Oh, you're going tothe lockup tonight? Well, isn't collision playing? What you knowabout collision? I know plenty about them. You happen to be lookingat the drummer's girlfriend. - Whatever.-I'm serious. So? You're not into the music. I know plenty aboutthe music. Oh, name a song. - Uh...-yeah, exactly. Okay, look, I am goingwith you tonight, okay? - No, you're not!-Yes. If dad thinksi'm going with you, then he won't say anything, see? Oh, I see. You need me. Yeah. (Sighs) fine, Wesley.I need you. - Now, let me get that stud, right there.-Uh-uh. No. No. Well, then, hey, Zoe, i guess it's just me solo. I've got to just go alone. Fine! No, wait, here.Just take them. Now, final rule.You go out tonight, no one is to knowyou're my sister, okay? You're just some sad, unpopular girl... - (Chuckling) okay.-That just gotinto the club. Okay. You know what? Whatever you say. Here. Hold up.I only need one of these. Oh, but I need two, and I'm not putting that oneback into my ear after your nose fungushas been on it, so bye. - Welcome to the house.-Get out. (Knock on door) I got it! - Hey, sweetie!-Oh, hey, mom. Listen, I just wantedto drop off the restof your things before I went out of town. - Where are you going?-Dwayne and I are going awayfor the weekend. - Oh, really?-Mmm-hmm. You see how nice it isnot to have to worry about me? Zoe, you are my child, and I will alwaysworry about you. - Okay.-but it is kind of nice. (Both laughing) So, how you doing? Fine. Yeah? You adjusting okay? Ma, it has only beenlike four days, and yes, everything has been fine. Oh, you knowthat summer program - that's supposed to bestarted next week?-Uh-huh. Aliyah just signed me upfor it, so we're good. - Aliyah?-mmm-hmm. Well, why didn't your daddo it? I guess he was working. Listen, Zoe. Listen, Zoe. Now, I know that youand Aliyah haven't alwaysgotten along. Okay? But if she does anythingthat's out of order, you let me know, okay?'Cause I don't want herputting hands on you. Okay, mom.Look, I was 10 then.I'm 16 now, and I do not get spankingsanymore, so it's fine. Well, don't forgetwho your mother is. You might be living here now, but that doesn't meanthat she can boss you around. - Okay.-okay. - Living here?-Oh, hey, Aliyah. Jasmine. Zoe, could you excuse usfor a minute, please? - Oh, yeah.-Thanks. Uh, hello? Sorry. Sorry. Girl, you're out of your mind. - All right, mom. Love you.Have a good trip.-Okay. Yeah, Aliyah, can you make this quick?'Cause I'm kind of in a rush. Oh, sure.I just heard what you saidand wanted to assure you that I have nevermistreated Zoe. Well, I have never putmy hands on my daughter, so I don't really appreciatethe way you discipline. Well, as long asshe's living here, she has to abideby our rules.Plain and simple. Well, just remember thatshe's not your daughter. Well, not biologically, but I treat her as thoughshe's my own, and therefore, I willdiscipline as thoughshe's my own. Put your handson my daughter, and I'm gonna puthands on you. You are not gonna come inhere disrespecting me. What's wrong, Aliyah? You can't talkwoman-to-woman? - Well, maybe if I weretalking to a woman...-Oh, really? (Both shouting indistinctly) What is all this noisegoing on out here? If y'all make my souffle fall,i'm gonna sit you both down. Aliyah. Nothing, mom. Nothing? - Jasmine?-nothing, miss Turner. (Scoffs) nothing. But yet you both standout here with your lipsall puckered out like you've been suckingon lemons. What's going on? Jasmine doesn't feel that zoeshould listen to me becausei'm not her mother, which is asinine. I don't agree with herparenting style. And you know what? You can throw aroundthem $20 words if you want to, but if you call me outof my name again, it's gonna be a problem. I didn't call you asinine.I said that your mamawas asinine. - My mama's asinine?-Stop it right now! Stop it right now! This is crazy. Ain't no shame in my game. Well, there should be.You two are actinglike children. Sit down. I said sit down. (Groans) Aliyah. You go first. What kind of exampleare you setting for Zoe, seeing her mamaand her stepmom argue like housewivesof the mob bachelorette? You know whati'm talking about? This is just ridiculous. Now, you've been with jayfor six years. It's about time that you allstop arguing and learnhow to get along. - I can't talk to her.-I can't talk to her. Well, if y'all listened, talking would be easier. Now, I normally don't get ingrown folks' business, but since you'reacting like kids, I'm gonna treat you like kids. - Now, look at each other.- (Sighs) Don't make me repeat myself. - Aliyah, you go first.-She doesn't respect me. It's not that.I don't like yourparenting style. How many timesdo I have to tell you that? - Let her talk. Let her talk.-All right. She's still upsetbecause I spanked zoewhen she was 10 and I didn't askfor permission. - Is that true?-I don't even spankmy daughter. Hmm, well, that mightbe your problem. - (Exclaims)-hush. She should have askedor at least had her dadhandle it. Zoe's 16, so you're madabout something that happenedsix years ago? Mmm-mmm.there's got to be moreto it than that. She thinks she's betterthan me! Zoe said that she heardher say, that Jay upgradedwhen he married her. You shouldn't have said thatin front of my daughter, even if that is how you felt. Is that true? (Chuckles) it sure is. See? See, that's whati'm talking about. It's that smug lookon her face, and I don't want my daughterthinking that kind of attitudeis okay! - You have every rightto be mad, baby.-Thank you. But you've alsogot to realize that you cannot let aliyahdrag you down tothat level of childishness. If you do that, baby, you'll only prove her point. Aliyah, when you met Jay, you didn't have a jobor a place to live. - Now, is that an upgrade?-Ma! - Whose side are you on?-Zoe's. Together, you two could bea shining example of whatwomanhood is all about, but like this, you're killing her perception, and it's got to stopright now, and I meanright now. I shouldn't have saidwhat I did in front of Zoe. You shouldn't havesaid it at all. And you need to respectmy marriage and stop asking jaywhat he sees in me. - Oh, you know about that?-Yeah, I know about that. (Chuckling) i wonder what he sawin either one of you. Mom! I'm not saying you're notwonderful women. What I'm saying, is get it together. Aliyah, when you married Jay, you married everythingthat came along with him, including zoeand Jasmine. That's right. - And Jasmine.-Hmm? Who you are has nothingto do with my daughter'sopinion of you. Baby, just be a role modelfor Zoe, not Aliyah. And talk to Jay aboutyour issues, and let himdeal with the things that's going onin his house. Now, I don't want to hearanother peep out ofeither one of you. Deal? - Yes, ma'am.-Yes, ma'am. - (Bell dings)-Y'all hear that? That means that this therapysession is over. Now go check on my souffle. I'm tired.Y'all ain't gonna worry me. Well... I'm gonna go, and I'll call about Zoe later. - Bye, miss Turner.-Call anytime, Jasmine. - Bye.-ma. - Souffle.-but ma. - Souffle.- (groans) - I love you, ma.-Child, did my souffle fall? - No, ma'am.- (Chuckles) All right, then.I love you, too. - Well, I guess you told them, huh?- (Chuckles) - How long you beeneavesdropping?-I don't know. Long enough to knowthat you still got it, though. (Laughs) I'll tell you what, you keepbeing nosy, I'm gonna give yousome of what I still got. Oh, come on.You don't mean that. See, me and you, we've alwaysbeen pretty cool. - Think so?-Yeah. You are the only one whoever really listens to me, so... Baby, sometimes, parents get so caught upin their own issues, they forget who they'reactually doing it all for. Yeah, well, I mean, i guess we were allborn selfish, right? And we have to learnbenevolence and compassion, and some peoplejust have a very slowlearning curve, so... Hmm.where'd you get that from? - You, Nana.- (Laughs) - Well, I guess we are cool.-The cool ones. - Give me some.- (Chuckles) I don't think so.Nana, come on. I'm just playing. - Oh, there you are. Hey.-Hey, baby. How you doing? You okay?I'm good.How was your day? - Great. Great. You?-Fine. I still don't understand why a16-year-old isn't foldingher own clothes. Hold on one second.I'll make this change. Zoe! Zoe! Jay, she and wesleywent to the mall. Oh, okay.Well, baby, just leave it. You know I can't standfor fresh, clean clothesto just lie around. - All right.-Look, I got it. Okay, no, no, no.I will help you out. - Oh, she's pretty long now.-So... When were you planningon telling me that Zoe was gonna be herefor the school year and notjust the summer? Oh, I was, uh... I was planningto tell you tonight. No, I'm serious.This is just the first timethat me and you have been able toget together since - I've been workingthe long hours.-Mmm-hmm. Well, don't you think maybeyou should have talked to me before you told hershe could move in? Well, baby, she asked. And you still shouldhave talked to me first. Would you have said "no?" Jay, that's not the point. Look, you didn't even considerwhat I might have said. On our first date, I told youthat I had custody of my son, and I asked you whetheror not that was goingto be a problem. Mmm-hmm, and I told youthat I had a daughter that sometimes stays with meduring the summersand weekends. Exactly. So, if that agreementhad changed, you shouldhave informed me. Why didn't youinform me first? Because we're married. So what? Does that mean that youno longer have to consider my opinionbecause we're married? No. No. No. It just means that my daughteris now your daughter. You still shouldhave asked, Jay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Baby, I reallywould like Zoe to come stay with usuntil she graduateshigh school. Is that all right with you? - Is it?-It's not like I cansay "no" now. Why would you say "no"? Jay, I wouldn't. But if I did, are youreally gonna tell her shehas to go back home? Exactly. You're right. You're absolutely right. You know what? Now that you mention it, i read something, an article in the paper today. It said that stevewas coming here to takea new sports-anchor job. That true? - Yeah, he called and told me.-Hmm. So, that means that he's gonnabe living here. - Yep.-hmm. So, when were you planningon telling me? My plan was to tell youtonight. (Chuckles) hmm. So, does Wesley know thathis father is here? No. I was gonna talkto Steve first and see if he's reallygonna be here full-time - and see how involvedhe planned to be.-Hmm. Well, he hasn't been involvedsince you two got split up. - Yes.-so, why would theychange now? Well, that's because he wasliving across the country. But now that he lives here, i don't know.Who knows? Hmm. - He and Wesley talk.He sends him money.- (Chuckles) Look, Jay, he wasn't able tohave him during summersbecause of training camp, but now that he's notplaying anymore, who knows? I don't know what steveintends on doing. Yeah. You alwaysmake excuses for him. No, I don't. I don't make any excusesfor Steve. But Wesley idolizeshis father, despiteeverything that's happened. So I'm gonnatalk to Steve first and make surehe doesn't get hurt. Hmm. Sounds great. But I think we shouldboth talk to him. Because I want to know him. - Right?-hey, mom. - Hey, what's up, Jay?-What's going on, bro? You wouldn't believewho I saw at the mall today. Dad.he just moved here. Guess those plans are notworking out as planned, huh? Where did you two get allthat stuff? Dad.he gave us his credit card. Okay, how come you never giveme your credit card? Baby, because I don't haveto do things to easemy guilty conscience. Uh-huh. Point taken. Uh, you two, don't get tooexcited about this stuff, because it'll probablyhave to go back. Mom, look, don't make me takethese back. Please. You knowhow much allowance I had to save upjust to get these? Wesley, why didn't you justcome to us and ask us forthe money for the sneakers? They cost over $100. Brother, I'm so glad that youdidn't involve us in that. Baby, there's a lotof wisdom in this one. - I don't have to takemy stuff back.-Whoa, wait a minute. And why is stevebuying you anything? Uh, well, he said he didn'twant me to feel bad, leaving empty-handed, so he told me to shop, too. Oh, you see? That's exactly why I need totalk to Steve first. He always gets him excitedabout stuff and thenlets him down. Uh, dad, I evengot you something. Listen, I don't need youto buy me anything. Oh! Whoa! This is exactly what... Baby, can you believehow good this looks on me? And can you believehow quickly it has to go back? But I got it for you. It's going back.Put it in the bag. Matter of fact, don't takeanything out ofthe boxes or bags until me and your motherhave had a chanceto discuss it. - Come on.-Zoe, fold up your clothes. Wesley, go clean up your room. Go ahead, do whatever it isyou're doing. - Wesley, the bag stayswith me.-That's right. And I'll take care of this.Okay? Yeah. (Chuckles) jay, you are notkeeping that hat. - Oh, baby, I was just makingsure that it was in the bag.-In the bag? - That's right.-In the bag? - Keep it in there.-Mmm-hmm. (Sighs) And you... you know, i had to fold up all these... Oh, oh, that hatwas off the chain! - Yeah! Yeah! Where did you get that?-Mc pesticide. Oh, well, look at you. No, no, no, no, no, no. I actually did considerthe whole, you know, recruiting job, and to be honest with you, i got a better offer. - (Knock on door)-No, I thought... Hold... hold... You know what? I'll give you a call back. No. No.I'll call you back. Peace. Coming! Hey. - Oh.-why did you let my kidsbuy all of that junk? Steve, you are not gonna movehere and start wreaking havocon my life! Hello, Aliyah! How are you? Like a drink, huh? Don't you "hello, Aliyah" me, and no, I don't wanta thing to drink. Come on, now.I don't even know whati did wrong this time. Well, that's your problem, steve. You never do. (Sighs) The best thing you cando for Wesley, is spend time with him. Stop buying hima whole bunch of stuffhe doesn't need. Look, come on, baby.Ain't nothing wrong with me spoiling my boyevery once in a while. I got the means to do it.Your means have neverbeen your issue, have they? The question iswhat are your intentions? You knowwhat my intentions are? I intend to be a father likei've always been. Oh, honey, well, you havebeen a provider but certainlynot his father. Oh, okay. Well, I'm very sorrythat queen aliyahfeels that way, but news flash, baby, I'm a much better fatherto him than my daddyhas ever been to me. Oh, wow.Well, that ain't sayingtoo much, now, is it? Aliyah, come on, baby.What do you want from me? Well, if you don't knowright now, we need to sit down - and lay downsome ground rules.- (Sighs) And first things first. If you want to see Wesley, you have to talk to me first. - What?-no calling him upand making plans. Oh, come on.The boy's 17 years old. Yes, he is a boy, and I am his mother. Look, Steve.I am serious. He's doing well in schoolthis year, and I need himto stay focused. Okay. Okay. I won't call him.I'll call you. - Thank you.-Good? All right, now, hold on.I want to... I want toask you something, now. Why isn't wesleyplaying football? - Are you serious?-Why doesn't he play ball? Come on! - Are you even listening to me?-Yes, I am listening! It only seems likethe natural thing to do! I mean, his dadactually only has the heisman trophyand two super bowl rings. Come on! That's about you, Steve.Wesley likes skateboarding. He likes what? Did... did you say he likesto skateboard? No, no, no, no, no."Hey, hey, hey, Steve.Your son play football?" No, man! He likes to skateboard. Oh, god! I knew I should havetaken him this summer. - So you could teach himhow to play football?-Exactly. What about teaching himhow to be a man? Hey, hey.We talk about man stuffall the time, okay? What's your husbandtalk to him about? Skateboarding? I'm gonna tell youone more time. Don't mess with my son. Either you're all the way in, or you're out.

Well, not really.I mean, he's always working, you know? When he's not playing, he's training, and when he quit, he went overseasfor a while, you know? I don't understand it. You seem to think that yourfather is so perfect, yet youcomplain about your mother all the time, but she'sthe one that's right here, doing all the work. Mom didn't buy me a car. (Laughing) oh! So, that's it. New stuff... New cars and kicks, huh? That's not whatit's all about. I mean, it is nice to getnew cars and new kicksevery once in a while. Mmm-hmm.

Uh, that's not in the plans, but, you know, I don't know.Maybe. I think you guys should. - Thanks for letting mekeep the shoes, by the way.-Hmm. And where are you going again? - To the movies.-Right. - Movies.-yeah.it's dark in the movies. Okay, dad.Look, I already know whereyou're going with that, and just so you know, the movie-theater lobbyis kind of like a catwalk, and while I'm waiting in linefor my popcorn, I just wantto give them "bam." - Oh.-see, one wrong fashionchoice, and you might as well, - (chuckling)-i don't know, transferto another school. - It's that serious, huh?-Yes, dad.

Okay. - Um, well, okay.It's nothing big.-Right. But, okay, okay.Here it is.Yeah. I don't really like havingto ride around with Wesley everywhere, so how come I can'tjust have my own car? Because you don't need a car. - Well, I do.-Really? Yes. Look, okay. See, I don't think you reallyunderstand my schedule, but it's very hectic. - Enlighten me.-Okay, so, I haveswim team practice 8:00 a.m. Every morning, which willthen switch to 4:00 p.m..In the afternoons once school starts, and then this summer, i have gymnastics on tuesdaysand wednesdays, and then pre-college courseson mondays and Fridays. So, you work all the time, and Aliyah is gonna get tiredof taking me everywhere. Did she say that? - Okay, not exactly, but, I mean, I can tell.-Hmm. And if you get me a car, then I can help you outby running errands. I don't need you to do that. - Wesley has a car.-His father bought him a car. We don't want him toout do you, now, do we? (Chuckling) i'm not in the competition. Listen, is there a jobsomewhere in thishectic schedule? - Um, no.-I can't hear you. No, but I don't have timefor a job, dad. Well, I think the moviesis calling you. - What if we justtalk about it...-Later. Later.we'll discuss it later. - Okay.-all right? Okay, well, you know mybirthday is next month, so don't forget. I'm not gonna missyour birthday. No, I'm not talkingabout my birthday. I'm actually talking aboutthis conversationabout the car. Goodbye, Zoe. Bye, daddy. Oh, thank you. It's about time, Zoe.You're gonna make me late. The movie doesn'tstart for another hour, so it's okay. Zoe, I'm not goingto the movies, okay? I'm dropping you off, then I'm meeting my dadat the station. He's gonna give mea behind-the-scenes tour, and then we're goingto a party. Okay, well, you knowthat sounds like way morefun than the movies, so... - No, you can't come.-Please, please, please? No. Look, look, I have to talkto my dad aboutsome important stuff. I don't want your big mouthtalking about it beforeit's even decided. Before what's decided? Wes, what is it? We're going to seeif I can live with my dad. - Hey, I just got here.-All the more reason. No, Zoe, look, I'm serious. We've never got any timeto get to know each other because he's always livedon the west coast. - Okay.-now is the perfect time. - And plus, in a year, I...-So, are you gonna take mewith you or what? 'Cause this whole... Did you just interrupt me? No, no, no.Actually, I just interjectedin between your words, which isn't reallythe same thing, so... Yeah, I'm dropping you offat the movies. No, Wes! Please! Please! Mom, we're about to leave! Hey. So, what timewill you two be back? Around like 12:00. I thought the movie startedat 7:00. - We'll probably get somethingto eat afterwards.-Yeah. - A little snack.-Okay. Well, by midnight, you two better bewalking through that door. - Okay. All right.Got you, mom.-Mmm-hmm. - All right. Love you.-All right. Love you guys. Zoe: bye. Love you, too. Have fun. Wesley: we will.Zoe: Will do. - Midnight.-Wesley: okay. Zoe: okay. Okay. Jay, could you get down herefor a minute? (Jay scatting) - You busy?-No, baby. - Just taking careof some work.-Mm-hmm. Well, mom just left. The kids are goneuntil midnight. So, I was thinkingyou and I could go outfor dinner instead of cooking. - Oh, yeah, that's whati'm talking about.-Hmm. - Oh, wait. Oh...-What? Midnight? Yeah. That's Wesley's curfewin the summertime.You know that. Yeah, but Zoe's curfewis 10:00. Uh-huh.but she's riding with Wesley. All right, but come on, baby.You can't just changea curfew time because she's ridingwith Wesley. She's younger. - By one year.-Mm-hmm. Jay, you're not calling her. Yeah, yeah.I'm gonna just, uh... - Honey, listen.-Hello? It's too lateto change things now, all right? They'll be back by midnight. (Sighing) Why wouldn't you call mebefore you let them leave? For the same reasonyou didn't talk to me first before you told hershe could move in here. Okay. All right. So, now I seewhat this is about. That's what's beenbothering you? Come on. Let's talk about it. Come on, baby.Let's talk about it.Don't shut down. Jay, you should haveasked me first. Asked you what? She's my daughter. And I'm your wife. And we should havehad a conversationbefore you told her she could move in here. She's normally hereon the weekends, so I don't understand... Yeah, the weekends, Jay. Not every day a weekfor the next two yearsor until she goes to college. But you're always talkingabout how you want, uh, Wesley and herto spend more time together. (Exhaling) that is not the point. I'm trying to tell youthat we should havehad a conversation before you told hershe could move in here. Jay, you're alwaysmaking these decisionswithout talking to me first. - Okay.-you changed the bankwithout telling me. - Uh-huh.-you changed this paint color.I mean... Okay, so, you're saying that you have a challengewith Zoe moving in here. Yes. Yes, Jay, I do. Look, raising another child ismore of a responsibility - than I really want right now.-Hmm. I'm going back to school, andwith work, there's just notenough time. Baby, they're teenagers.They practically raisethemselves. No, they don't, Jay. You're gone most of the week, so you have no idea. I have to clean upbehind them.I have to cook. I have to... Let them cook and cleanfor themselves. Wesley's 17. I mean, you shouldn't bewashing his clothes anyway. You're 38, and I still wash yours. - But I'm your husband.-And he's my son. Who needs to learnsome responsibility. You need to stop babying him. - I don't baby him.-Yes, you do. And when I give him rules, you don't back me up on it. That's because sometimes, you're just too hard on him. He's a man who's aboutto enter this world, and he needs to be prepared. If not, he's gonna end upright back here with us. To tell you the truth,i'm ready for both of themto be away at college so I can have more timeto spend with my wife. Now, look at me. Look at me. Why do you have a problem withzoe moving in, hmm? Baby, I've talked to Jasmine, and everything is okay. So, what is it? You're gonna be really upsetwhen I say this. Well, say it anyway. Jay, I don't want to shareyou with anyone else. What? Look, I know it's selfish, but I'm just being honest. I already find myself justwaiting around here to try to spend somequality time with you as is. You work so much, and now, with another personin this house who needs you, I mean, it's... (Sighs) She's my daughter. - I know.-Hmm? I know. And for the six yearswe have been married, I have enjoyed spendingquality time with her and watching her grow intoa beautiful young woman. Yeah, as long as it's noton weekends and holidays. Don't say it like that, Jay. Well, baby, how elseam I supposed to say it? I mean, what if it was the sameway when we were... What if I felt the same waywhen we met, hmm? I mean,i've been raising wesleysince he was 11 years old. I know, Jay.And you know how muchi appreciate that. So, you're saying that youwouldn't have married meif I had custody of Zoe? Of course I would havemarried you. It's just that I would haveknown from the beginning what I was signing up for. You signed up to loveand Cherish me. My daughter is part of me. You knew thiswhen we got married, so whether it'stwo days a week or seven, it's what you signed up for. I shouldn't havesaid anything. No. No, I'm glad you did, because at least now, i know what the attitudeis about. - Jay, are you mad at me?-No. Just disappointed. - (Door closes)-God. (Cellphone dinging) (Sighing) Are you s... (Sighing) Ow. So, I, umm... I thought we'd go outand play some basketballa little later. - Is that all right?-Yeah, yeah, that's cool, dad. What time do you want to go? You know, I have a conferencecall in about an hour, so right after that. Okay. Cool. Seems cool. Crowd on TV: Defense! Defense! You good? Yeah, I'm good. You good? I'm great. - All right.-Great. So, umm... Mom says that you, umm... You're good in school. Yeah. Yeah.I might get a scholarship. Man! That's awesome. I'm telling you, those academic scholarships, that's where it's at 'cause sports... You know, it's risky. You can always get hurtor something. Yeah, I know, and plus they don't makeskateboard scholarships yet. Yeah, that's right. Your mama told methat you play the (lisping) skateboard. (Chuckling) dad, come on. No, I'm just sayingthat you play the (lisping) skateboard. (Laughing) I'm just kidding, son. Listen, umm... I want to ask you something. Get those big old feetoff my chair, boy. - Son, my boy...- (Chuckles) Listen, have you ever thoughtabout playing football? Yeah, I didwhen I was younger, but, dad, i wasn't really that good. (Stammering) shut up! Did you practice? Yeah, of course I practiced.I just... I didn't like the sport. I like individual sports. I'm not really that bigon teams. I'm gonna ask your mamafor a DNA test. I think she fooled aroundwith Tiger Woods or somebody. (Laughing) You know what? I wish... I wish that I had spentmore time with you, man. I mean, I begged your mom,"please, move down west." "Oh, no, I got to staydown here with my mama. "That's where my helpcome from." Yeah, she told me that.It's good. - Did she?-She told me. All right.Well, one thing I'm gonnapromise you, boy. Now that I'm back here, we're gonna spenda lot more time together, son. I'm gonna see youat least twice a month. Hey, dad, I was kindof thinking that... - (Doorbell ringing)-Oh, oh, oh, hold that thought. It's the door. Hold on. Let me (Laughing) I want to skate... (Groaning) Son, it's the boogeyman. Hey. - You are so pathetic.-Mmm. I came to get Wesley. No, no, we aboutto play some hoop.Wes is good. No, he's not good. Mom, what are you doing here? I came to pick you up. - Dad is gonnadrop me off later.-No, he's not. Aliyah, what is wrongwith you? Wesley was supposedto come home last night, not send his sisterhome with the car and text me at 11:30, saying he was gonnastay here with you. How come you didn't justtext me back last night? Aliyah: text you? Why didn't you bringyou're behind home last nightthe way you were supposed to? Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Really, I takefull responsibility. I told him thathe'd spend the night, send his sister home, okay? But it's good. It's all right 'cause we had a late breakfastafter the party. - The p... the party?-Wesley: He... What party? Yeah, yeah, about that, the party... No, it's okay. It's all right. Hey, it's all right.I just, um... I took himto the pre-draft partywith me. (Chuckling) we had a good time. Bam. Yeah. Are you talking aboutthe same pre-draft party that has all the desperatewomen trying to hookthemselves an athlete? - Uh...-dad, there was somebad girls. - There wasn't no girls.-You know what? You get in the car. - Mom, come on...-Now! Come on, Aliyah. - Hey, I'll see youa little later, all right?-All right, dad. - Love you, man.-Love you, too. All right. Hey! Don't talk about the girls. (Door closes) - Are you kidding me?-What? What are you doingbringing a 17-year-oldto a party like that? Aliyah, I was watching him. Steve, you knowwhat happens at those parties. Of course I do. That's where I met you.Remember? I'm gonna tell youone more time. You are not to see himuntil you talk to me first. And I'm gonna tell youhe's my son, too. Well, stop treating himlike he's your homeboy. - I'm not treating himlike he's my homeboy!-Yes, you are! Why do you haveto control everything? Wesley, I said get in the car! Let the boy talk. Go ahead. I want to move in with dad. - Oh! Shut up.-Absolutely not. (Scoffing) oh, no, no, no. Why not? Mom, you're always sayingthat you wish we were closer. Like, he's finally here. This is my last yearin high school. I made good grades. Like, this isthe perfect time. Wha... (Murmuring indistinctly) - So, what's up, Steve?-Hmm? Why don't you haveanything to say? - (Stammering)-ah. Come on, dad.Don't you thinkit's a good idea? Huh? Uh, yeah, man. I thinkit's an excellent idea. But I also thinkthat you ought to listento your mother. See, that's the best thingfor you to do. The Bible say you oughtto listen to your parents, which is pleasing to jehovah. - Doesn't it say that, baby?-Ooh, honey, you are quoting Bible verses? Jalapeno. Wow. You know what? (Scoffing) it's funnybecause you have never cared about wesleylistening to me before. No, that's... that's... That's not true. She lies. (Laughing) No, I always told youi appreciate the wayyou raise my son. Didn't I tell you that, huh? Didn't I? - That's what I thought.-You know what, Wesley? Mama is tired. So, if you want to go aheadand move in with your daddy, you go right ahead, baby. Cool. Dad, I guessi'm moving in tomorrow. No, no, no, no. I mean, tomorrow kind of soon, right?

All right, baby, no problem. - Mm.-guess I'll see you tomorrow. - All right! We'll see you tomorrow, baby.-All right, see you then. - Love you, son.-Love you, too. Mm, how great is that? You know what, Steve? He's gonna need a little helpwith all that packinghe has to do, so, uh, what time you gonnacome by tomorrow? (Stammering) I'll call you. Please do. No, wait. Wait.Let me talk to youfor a second. Li... no, no, li... Aliyah... Aliyah! (Exhales sharply) - Hey, what's up, Jay?-Hey. What's going on? Not much.

Then I won't haveto ride around - with Wesley everywhere.-Wow. - Hold on. Hold on.You begged to go with me.-That's an interesting tone. Uh, listen, you, no swimming, uh, no gymnastics, uh, no cellphone. As a matter of fact, next week you're gettingyourself a part-time job. I don't want to hear it. What? Well, is Wesley gettinggrounded, too? I'm moving in with my dad. Well, how about both of youmove on upstairs? Wesley: yeah. Let's go. Snitch. Yeah, I hopeyou enjoyed the party. I can't believethat you're allowing himto do this. And we didn't talkabout this again why? - Okay, Jay, not now, please.-All right. I'm just sayingthat we have to beon the same page if we're goingto defeat the enemy. - The enemy?-Yeah. Teenagers. (Laughing) (Inhales sharply) So, you really gonnalet him do this? (Sighing) jay, if he wants to livewith his dad, so be it. That's gonna bethe quickest lesson that he has ever learnedin appreciation. Hmm. All right. Baby, are you still mad at me? Yes, I am.

I just want to get herthe things that she wants because she did not grow upin the house with me. Baby, look, I know, and I appreciate that. And I know you do the sameexact thing for Wesley. - I love you for that.-Yeah, well, he's my son, too. Look, I really do feel badfor what I said. It's just that I really, really miss spending timewith you, and Zoe doesn't alwayslisten to what I say, so it's gonna make thingsa lot harder. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But I'm sorry. Hmm. Really? - Mm-hmm.-yeah, well... (Chuckles) I'm sorry, too. Shut up and kiss me. I think I can do that. - You can do that?-Yeah. - You can do that?-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Ooh! * As we lay * (laughing) that's whati'm talking about, baby. All this love going on, honey, I might get me a new grandbabyin the mix! (Laughs) - Aliyah: hi, ma.-Hey, baby.

Look, on that note, let me go check on Zoe.I'll be right back. Okay, baby, listen, the two that we have... No, no, no, no, no, there is no way. We might be homefree in two years. Think about that. Yeah, I'll think about that. - Let me go check on Zoe.- (Chuckles) Okay, I'll be up in a minute 'cause I have some new infoon that stonehenge situation. (Exhales heavily) Aww, ma, i have such a good husband. Baby, you just nowrealizing that? Mm. I don't know.Some days I, uh, I know itmore than others. (Exhales heavily) (Groans) So, how am isupposed to trust youif you lie to me? Dad, I really was gonnago to the movies until I found outabout the party. Mm. Why didn't you just ask me? Well, you would havesaid "no." Absolutely. Well, then I would have beenin direct defiance. See, not asking youwas like indirect defiance, based on the assumptionthat you might not agree. You really arethe enemy. (Stammering) enemy? What? You're wrong, okay, plain and simple, and you are on punishment. And you see, i was down there thinkingabout getting you a car, but now I see you're notresponsible enough... No, dad, please, please, i need my own car. Oh, so, you only wantedto move here for a car.

And what happensafter this explosion? Explosion? When they blow up, the explosion. What happens? After he becomes famous, do you think he's still gonnawant to be with you? I mean, I am his girlfriend. I know I'm gonna have to, like, put up witha few groupies, but... - Oh, god.-At the end of the day, they always go backto the one who was with thembefore it all exploded. - Aliyah: hm.-So, she played me. Oh, honey, did she play you. (Chuckles) And by the way, his social statussays "single." So, if he's not claiming younow as a nobody, do you really thinkhe's gonna claim youas a famous drummer? Oh, you don't know that. Whoa, hold on, social status? Aliyah: oh. Jay. - Okay, babe, look...-Yeah? I think it's timethat Zoe and ihad a little girl talk.

Okay, look, save it. I already knowwhat you're gonna say. - Really?-yep. You're a mom, so you're not gonna listen. You're just gonna tell me that I'm too young to like himand that I need to focuson my future. Okay, well, first of all,i'm not gonna tell youyou're too young. I met stevewhen I was 16, at a partyi had no business attending. He was 18, and I fell for him hard. See? Well, honey, that's why I can understandwhat you're going through. So, you don't thinki'm being ridiculous? Well, you're being a girl. And girls are ridiculous and irrational and romantic and sometimesjust plain foolish. - Hey.-hey, look, I am includingmyself in that statement. Women are justgirls with wrinklesand stretch marks. Ew. You have stretch marks? Okay, focus, Zoe. Okay. Um, look, I know what happenedbetween you and Steve, so, what, you thinkthat's just gonna happento me, right? Oh, honey, it better not. I got pregnanttwo years afterwardstrying to hold on to him. Oh, wait. Look,i'm not getting pregnant. I'm going to law school. Zoe, that's exactlywhat I'm saying, honey. Just go out thereand live out your dreams. And if those dreamsare supposed to include"Mr. Henge," well, they willwhen it's time. And he... I don't know.If he becomes rich and famous, well, girl, let him do his thing 'cause your stock only goes upas you mature. - Eh?-okay, and by "stock,"you mean value, right? Yes, value. Zoe, I made a lot of mistakesin my life. And I have become strongerbecause of them. And I know you're gonnamake your share, too, but if there's any waythat I can help youavoid the big ones, I'd like to help you do that. - (Laughing)-okay. Look, I promise you, when you get to collegeand you see all thosecute little frat boys getting degrees in medicine, Mr. Stonehenge won't seemlike the wonder of the worldthat he is today. Okay. Okay. But, I mean, for nowyou have to admithe is pretty hot. (Chuckles) yeah, if you likethat grungy, "i haven't washedmy hair in two weeks, "two months, ew, two years" look. Girl, that boy is a mess. (Laughs) Hey, do you smellthat peach cobbler? (Sighs) Fresh out of the oven. Well, suggestion. Since Wesley's moving out, how about Nana just move in? Oh, honey, who needstwo know-it-all mothersin one house? You know what? (Clicks tongue) Yeah, I thinkyou're kind of right. Aliyah: one is plenty.Trust me. So, you're really leaving, huh? Wesley: yeah. Don't you think you're hurtingyour mom's feelingsby leaving? Did you hurtyour mom's feelingswhen you left? I don't know. Well, at least I'm leavingfor a good reason. Not like I'm leavingfor some stupid guy. That's not entirely true, okay? I mean, I've always wantedto live with my dad, and I wonderif I'd be different had he raised meinstead of my mom. - So...-yeah. Yeah. (Footsteps approaching) You ready? Mom, am I hurtingyour feelings? A little. Mom, I don't mean to.It's just... Baby, look, I know. Look, don't worry.I'll be fine. In fact, I've got, um, miss Zoe here to workon that one good nervei got left. You can count on me. - I know.- (Knocking on door) That's him. - Hey.-what's up, dad? Hey. How you feel, baby? I'm good.

Yeah, don't worry about him.He'll be all right. - You know, maybe I justshould have said "no."-Mm. You know, been the mean old mom, as always, - and then stevewould still be his hero.-Hey, stop. Look at me. You did the right thing, okay? You helped your sontake his first stepsinto manhood. - You think?-Absolutely. You let him know that everything that glittersis not always gold. And that sometimes, the best gifts are right up under your nose. - Really?-yeah. - Under your nose?-Under your... Yeah, under your nose. For real? (Stammering) what are you doing? (Chuckling) I'm moving under your nose. - No, no, see, i already know that, you know?-Mmm-hmm. I'm blessed. - You know, what you need to do...-Ah-huh.

Jay went upstairs to get her. Would you liketo have something to drink? No. Okay, well, would youat least have a seat? Okay, Jasmine,i'll just get right to it. I wanted to apologize to you for anything I have ever saidor done that made you feeluncomfortable. You have done an excellent jobof raising Zoe. Okay, could you not look at melike that? (Chuckling) i'm trying to be serious. Wow. Okay, um... I accept your apology. - (Clearing throat)-And? What? (Sighs) I mean, aren't yougonna apologizefor disrespecting my marriage? No. I mean, 'cause I always didwonder why Jay, you know, married you. Yeah, but then Zoe told methat you were a good cook, so I was just assumingthat was it. I mean, what else could it be? - (Chuckling)-you... Girl, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. (Both laughing) I was about to say,"girl, you better step..." I know.I saw it in your eyes. (Laughing) Can I be honest with you? Please do. (Exhaling) all right. This is really hard for meto admit, but, um... I can never really understand why Jay left me and zoeand took you and your son in. I mean, it's like he tradedone for the other. But, Jasmine, we met over two yearsafter you two divorced. No, I know, but it doesn't matter, 'cause when he refers to you, it's likeyou're his fresh start, and like we were so awful, like he had to havesomething new. And that... That really hurt. And so I blamed you for it. Words are powerful. Yes, they are. So, I'm hopingthat these next twoare just as powerful. I'm sorry. Your mother's right. We... We can't keep doing thisto the kids. Oh, god,i'm so happy we did this. I'm just so sorry. - Mm.-so overdue. Yes. Believe it. (Both laughing) Jasmine: speaking of grown, you are not wearingthose shoes. Oh, well, Aliyah saidi could wear them. Zoe only moved hereso she can go to schoolwith stonehenge. Oh, you started it. Stonehenge, huh? - That's not entirely true.-Uh-huh. - I mean, come on, mom.-Let's go, young lady. Let's be very logicalabout this. Jasmine: yeah, well, we gonna be logical. - Zoe: I'm saying to be logicalabout all of this.-Okay. Mm. Jay: I told you those shoeswere too grown. Well, I can alwaystake them back - and exchange themfor my size.-Mm. - (Chuckles)-see, that was your planall along, wasn't it? Of course not. I thought we weretalking about, you know, brutal honesty. - Brutal honesty?-Brutal honesty. - Okay. Well, then someone...-Where are you going? Needs to explain this. - Oh. Wow. That old thing?-Mmm. I'd forgotten all about that. - That old thing?-Mm-hmm. Don't you mean the new hatthat Zoe bought you? No, baby, that's not new. (Stammering) that's my old hat. That's... you know what I mean? - Mm-hmm.-you know, i don't change my style. You don't change your style? - No, mm-hmm, mmm-hmm.-Mmm-hmm. (Chuckles) Wesley: oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
