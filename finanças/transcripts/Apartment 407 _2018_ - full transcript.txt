What you're about to see is not just based on a true story, it's based on my true story, a story I lived through and memories I live with every day. There are millions of people out there right now being bought and sold. I want to share this film for awareness and not as a victim, as a survivor. Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary. You gonna make me a nice breakfast? Huh, I think you should be making me a nice breakfast. How do you know I didn't? Mm. Because in three years, when did you ever make me a nice breakfast? Go on then, now's your chance, eh? It's not gonna make itself. Well, we could make breakfast together. Or... We'll make something else entirely. Um, I'd rather just have breakfast, - but thanks for the offer. - No, no, no, no, no. Um... Mommy, I'm hungry. Oh no, too bad, sweetie. No breakfast today. His majesty here would rather sleep than feed his girls. But I'm hungry. Okay, let's see what we can scrape up. His majesty? No! Look what he's done. Apology accepted. Yeah, that's good, keep it goin', keep it goin'. Chest relaxed. Keep your chest open. Lengthen your arms. Protect your backs. How's your back, Maria? You have 10 more seconds, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, hold it. Is it burning yet? - Yes. - Good! Hey Maria, you looked really good out there today. Eh, I looked okay. You feeling stronger? Yes, yes. So you're coming tomorrow? Uh, no. - No? - No. The insurance company, they, you know, they stopped paying for the classes, so I'm going to take a break, I guess. That sounds to me like you're not gonna come back. I want to,, it's expensive, so. You sure this is your last class? Yes, yes, today is the last. 'Cause it looks to me that you have five more classes in your account. No, no, I looked, it's definitely the last one today. Well, I'm looking right now, and you definitely have five more classes in your account. But I looked this morning, it say-- We're gonna get you better, okay? We're gonna get you stronger. - Well, thank you. - Come here. Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. - Just one? - Yeah, just one, sorry. Thanks. Spare a dollar? Um, I don't know if I have any change. Let me s-- let me look. Lady, it's just a dollar. I don't have any change. - Really? - I'm, I'm sorry. Cigarette? I don't smoke. Great, we got a healthy one here, yay. What are you looking at? You gonna eat all this? Come on, dude. What? Really? - Yeah. - Really? Yeah. It's just a sandwich. She paid for it. You know what, have it, it's fine, have it. Fuck you. Nice to meet you. Excuse me, miss? Can I-- can I have the other half? Sure. No one eats. Um, check please? Seriously, that was nice, not even a thank you, you're-- you're a good person. Um, I'm sorry to bother you again. First you get your sandwich taken, and then, now you gotta deal with me. I swear, I don't normally just, I mean, I don't ever just go up to some girl I don't know and yap her ear off, I just thought we sorta had a moment. Yeah, um, I have a boyfriend, if that's-- No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, of course you do, look at you. - I'm n-- I swear, I'm- - I'm totally not, absolutely not tryin' to pick you up. I'm married, happily. It's just that my day went to crap because of this client that I'm tryin' to please, and um, now they don't just want a model, they want an everyday girl. See where this is going? Uh, no. I'm just hoping, maybe, maybe consider, if you could come over to the studio, just try out for it. Uh, that's, you know, it's really nice of you to ask me, but, um, I don't think so. Bring someone along, a friend, neighbor, FBI agent. Um, thank you very much for asking me, but no, I'm gonna have to turn it down, I'm sorry. No, no, please don't apologize. I'm sorry, I came over here, your poor sandwich, and then I... badgering you. Check out the website, it's totally legit, I swear. That's, uh, thank you, but I don't think so. Seven grand. Pays seven grand for half a day's work. - That's a lot of money. - Yeah. - For half a day? - They have deep pockets. I'll um, I just, I don't, I mean, I don't know you, so. Okay, I can feel you. Look, just keep the card, no worries, please don't apologize. And, either way, it was nice talkin' to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was nice, nice to meet you. Yep. Thank you, bye. I looked at the site, and I think you should try it. Oh, but I'm just a mom, I'm not a model. Yeah, but you're a hot mom. It is a lot of money. Look, call him back and check it out, okay? What have you got to lose? I tell you what, call Brittany, call Brittany and tell her to come with you, or somebody just in case he's a total whack job, okay? She's working all day, but I'll call her. Look, I gotta go. Okay, kick some ass, okay, and call me afterwards. Just so I know that everything's okay, all right? Hey, it's Isobel again. Um, I'm outside, I think, but I'm not sure this is your building. I, um, uh, it doesn't look like-- Isobel. Hey, I was just leaving you a message. Aw, sorry about that. Is this where you live? We have a lot of creatives who work here, photographers, internet startups, writers. I've been here five years now, um, uh, my neighbor, builds websites. Nice guy. I don't know what to say. You know, I might, I'm just gonna go home. Okay, uh, hold on one second, one second. Chloe, can you come out front? Uh, oh, oh, no, no, no, carry on, my assistant. Uh, yeah, it's just she's, she's kinda having second thoughts. Okay, okay. Look, I know how this looks, but maybe you could call somebody and have 'em come over. Well, um, my boyfriend knows where I am. - Great. - And he said he might even - stop by, though. - Okay, great, cool, yeah. - Uh. - How long is it gonna be? Oh, you'll be outta here in 15 minutes. Um, what are the shots for? Caribbean Waterways, it's the biggest cruise line in the tourism industry. Maybe you've heard of them? - No. - No? Well, they're huge. Hence the money. Um. I don't mean to make you uncomfortable. Uh... okay, if you don't want to, it's cool. I mean, I'm here now, I feel kind of-- No, no, no, no, please, come in. You're more than welcome, Chloe's upstairs. - Shall we? - Chloe, Chloe? Yeah, yeah, she's sweet, intern. - Okay. - Okay. Hey, I'm Chloe, you must be Isobel. - Yeah. - So nice to meet you. Wow, she's gorgeous. You can see her in the pictures, right? - Totally. - I feel really weird now. No, no, no, no, no. No, I-- look, I totally get it. Seriously, you're being really smart about this. Thank you. Why don't you guys come inside? After you. So, how long have you been modeling? Oh, I'm not, I-- I teach Pilates. Oh, do you have your own studio, or? No, I wish. Someday, hopefully. You never know, this might open up opportunities. Oh. So, um, we have water, we have fruit, we have a betta fish in the back. Um, anything you need, I'm your man, okay? Let's, let's put some music on, keep things nice and relaxed, okay? Yeah, something sexy. Are you sure there's nothing I can do for you? You know, do you have a bathroom? I just need a bathroom. Yeah, we have a bathroom, it's just through there. Thank you. Let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Welcome. Thank you. Oh, what am I doing? Okay. Um, okay, why don't you come and stand on the X here so we can get a good frame. - Great. - And uh, let me take her bag. There you go, good. Okay, beautiful, nice. Very natural, good, beautiful. Over here. Mm, I have no idea what I'm doing. No, no, no, no, you're doing great, put your hands down. Oh yeah, let's lose the jacket. Okay, um, mm. You have a really great skin tone. And a great smile. You want a 50? Um, no, I'm good. Okay, now, imagine you're on the top deck of a cruise liner, Caribbean Waterways, and you're surrounded by water. You feel free, you feel excited, okay? Great, relax, relax. This feels really weird. Look right, right here, just off camera. Can we lose the jacket? Yeah, let's lose the jacket. - Uh, this one? - Yeah, yeah. Oh. Where's the last scenic place you visited? - Grand Canyon. - What, where? - Grand Canyon. - Good. Okay. Now, imagine you're there, right now, okay? All right, you look lovely. Great hair, one more, good. Wow, gorgeous. Goodbye Pilates, welcome to your new career. Thank you, Isobel. I will let you know when the client has a cardiac over your pictures. You're funny. Well, whatever happens, it was really nice to meet you both. Yes, nice to meet you, too, thank you so much again. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Isobel, congratulations, it's Chloe from the photo shoot. Peter was right, the clients booked you. If you wanna do the shoot, we start tomorrow at noon, same place. Uh, please call this number to confirm. I am so sorry. The reservation. All taken care of. I changed it until tomorrow. And Luigi's on the way. Your finest pepperoni, that disgusting cheese crust that you like. You're awesome. Now, what do you think? I think that all you need is a halo. Come on. What was he like, then? He was, he was actually really cool. - Yeah? - He was, yeah, very professional, there was an assistant, and she was very very nice and helpful, and yeah, it was kinda fun. And did you see any of the pictures he took? Yeah, I saw them, and I was surprised, they were good. I mean, I had no idea what I was doing. Babe, sometimes you just gotta go for it. Oh, I don't know, I don't know if, I mean, I have no idea what I'm doing. And I'll have to rearrange the whole studio tomorrow, and your mom would have to take care of Olivia all day, I just don't know. Well, she's a 60-year-old divorced woman with a blind dog, what else is she gonna do, huh? You know? You can't turn down this opportunity. All right, you win. I can't be eating these, 'cause I gotta be thin tomorrow. So, question. Yeah? Is Olivia asleep? She is. Okay then. Olivia. Oh, where is Olivia? Olivia. You have to count to 10. We don't have time to count to one. Okay, I guess I'll just have to sell these wings on eBay. No! Do you like 'em? Why do angels need glitter? Well, I guess they need it to light our way, 'cause when they walk around, the glitter falls off, and then we know where they went. It's like fairy dust. What happened to George? His eye fell off. Ouch. He is kinda old. Should we get a new one? No, I'm saving him for Lisa. Who's Lisa? Mark said he was gonna get me a sister called Lisa. Did he now? Hi, can I take those for you? Um, I was just looking for a price tag, actually. Yeah, sorry, this one just came in. Um, I can do 98. Um, you know, I'll just, I'll take this one. She'll love it. I'll just put this one back. Is it for a special occasion? It's for, it's an anniversary dinner. It's just a dating anniversary. Um, what do you say, just for you, it's your special night, we'll do $80 even. That's really nice of you. Does that work? Yeah, I'll take it. - Great. - Thank you. And if you end up with a ring on your finger, I expect an invite. You got it. Isobel. - Hey. - Hi. Wow, that's old school. Yeah, I still get some use out of 'em. - Come in. - Okay. Huh, am I early? Where is everybody? What are you doing? What are you doing? Do you want me to come back later when everybody's here and they're all setting up, and... Would you like a piece of fruit? My boyfriend is on his way. And he's--he's coming here, he's gonna be here soon. I look forward to meeting him. Have you ever been stabbed, Isobel? It's like a wasp sting. Burns. Only, it never cools down. Just gets hotter. At first, you don't feel a thing. But then, that warm trickle of blood on your skin, it gives it away. Now. I got lucky. But you... You could get nerve damage, you could get organ damage, you might get crippled, in a wheelchair, septicemia could set in, and then you'd need an amputation, you understand? You smell good. Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. Shh. I want you to be very clear. If you scream, there'll be no more Pilates. Okay? Are we clear? I need to use the bathroom. Of course. You know where it is. Just leave your phone on the table. I don't see why I have to do that. Leave your phone on the table. I feel s-- sick. It'll pass. I think the blue one should fit. Go ahead. I can't do that. You can, and you will. There you go. Okay, let's see. Please don't make me do this. You don't have a choice. The blue ones. - I can't. - Let's see it. I can't do it, please. Come on, come on. Come on. Now, look. That's gonna swell, so... Better get you some ibuprofen. Maybe a little makeup. Come on, breathe, breathe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, breathe. You're all right. I know. Now, are we clear? You gotta nod. There, good girl. The blue ones, hurry up. Put 'em on, meet me in the other room. Let's go. Lose the robe. Pl-- please don't make me do this. I'm just gonna take a few photos. Just like yesterday. You didn't seem so shy then. The robe. The quicker we start, the quicker it'll be over. I'll do it. It's okay. Mm. Very firm. You're an angel. Hands apart. Hm. C-scar, hm? So, this one's yours? That's my little girl. Yeah, she's beautiful. Motherhood can be such a gift. I'm just a mom. I don't do this kind of thing. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. That fish, it's called a betta fish. He's happy on his own. In fact, you try and add someone, turns him into a fighter, maybe even a killer. Now, they've been known to tolerate tank mates, but if they can't be friends, the situation turns nasty fast. And without any plants or rocks, that means there's nowhere to hide. The only hope for survival for any new addition is to keep its head down and do whatever it can to make sure that the betta remains content. Do you understand? Do you understand? Are you gonna kill me? Are you gonna kill me? No, I would never kill you. You're far too beautiful. We're just gonna take some pictures. That's it, just like before. Then what, you gonna let me go home? 'Cause I have a little daughter. I know. - I need to go home. - I know. Yes. I'm gonna let you go. After. Please don't hurt me. I'm not gonna hurt you. Please don't hurt me. I won't hurt you. As long... ...as you drink... ...this milk. Right now. Drink. Drink. Drink. More, more. Open. Open. Okay, okay, okay. Shh. Now. We have to take some proper photographs. Just like yesterday. Ooh. No. No tramp stamp. A virgin body is a rare body these days. Arms at your sides. Relax. I wanna go home now. Just, I want you excited, I want you relaxed. Remember, Grand Canyon. Good, yeah. I need you more relaxed. Here. Have some more milk. Feel better, in your stomach? No, no. No, no! No, no! No, no! No, no! No. It's okay. The first one is always the hardest. The bathroom is right there, you can go clean up. This is where you live now, okay? So, make yourself at home. Help, help, help, help, help, help. Help. Good. Glad you got that out of your system. But now you know, this is it. No one's gonna hear you. And... congratulations are in order. Your client is coming back in a few days. Very well done, Isobel. - A few days? - Yeah. So now you wait. And clean up. And I'll get you something to eat. No, I'm not gonna clean up, because I want the cops to see what happened when they get here. The cops? The cops aren't gonna come here. And where, exactly, is here, Isobel? How do you know you're even in the same building? The same city? The same country? You don't know anything. Mm. I thought you deserved some soup. Solid food might be a little hard for you to swallow. You said I could go home after the photos. And you will. We just need to do a few more things here. If I don't come home tonight, someone is gonna call the police, and they're gonna come looking for me. I don't care about the police, I told you. No one's coming here. No one knows where you are. What about my little girl? Hey, um, I'll take care of Olivia. No. What are you gonna do? Please don't hurt her, please-- - Relax, relax. - Please. I'm not gonna hurt her. In fact, I'll get a message to her. I'm gonna call Grancy. Now, I don't need to tell you what's gonna happen if you so much as breathe when I'm on the phone, understand? Hello, is this Grancy? Uh, it's Jim Wilson, I'm working with Isobel-- Nancy, Nancy, call the police! I've been kidnapped, call the-- No. Hello, is this Nancy? It's Jim Wilson. I'm working with Isobel today, and she wanted me to call you. Yeah, well, it's just, unfortunately, we're gonna run late. She wanted you to know. Uh, all right, I'll tell her. Yeah, thank you so much. Bye bye. Why are you doing this to me? For money. It's the same reason that you came here for in the first place. If it's just money, I'll get you money. I'll get a loan, I'll ask my friends, I'll get you money, I'll get you money. I've been down that road. It's cleaner this way, trust me. I'll make you agree, you can't, you can't treat me like this. Okay. It seems someone is ready for some more milk. You think you have a choice? Come on. Hello, Isobel. N-- no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Get away from me! Isobel, come here. Get that. Yeah, good, there you go, good girl. So... I've changed it this time, but I'd like you to get used to changing it every three or four clients. People come here to be safe and clean. I'm pregnant. Of course you are. They always say this. No, I really am pregnant. Really? If it's about the milk, take these. Those'll help relax you. My boyfriend dropped me off yesterday, so he knows where the studio is. It's a good thing you didn't bring him in. What would you've done if I did? Taken a few shots and then... let you go on your way. You can't just keep me here. Let's see. Ooh, classy girl. Please put that on. I'll make you feel so good. - For you. - Why? Why do you care? Why would you mistake me for caring? You're nothing special. I just want to prove that you lied. Just like the others. Come on. I'll wait. You know, they're not always accurate. Sometimes, sometimes you have to have a blood test to show the real results. Well, uh... this one's accurate. I, I apologize, it's just... they usually lie. No. With your glow, I-- I should've known. How far along are you? Um, about three weeks. This is the most important period. Have you been taking vitamins? Can I get you a, a sandwich? I'll make sure that you have everything you need. No. Never again! Isobel, I--I-- I've been thinking. You awake? Yeah. Ah. What? Help! Help! Help! Somebody! Help! Help, somebody! Come on! Somebody help me! Come on! Please, come on! Somebody help me. Please! Somebody! Come here. Let's play hide and seek. - Open the door. - Okay? Come on. Help! Open up. Don't open the door! Okay, okay. Open the chain, open the chain. Okay. There you go, good girl. Go to your room. No, no, no, no, n--! What now? Have a seat. Have a seat. Sit. No. Don't. Daddy? Wha--? We're just playing, honey. I'll look at your drawing later, okay? Hi, I'm looking for my girlfriend, Isobel. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. She said that she was taking pictures here with Peter Blatt, and I've knocked on a lot of doors, and I'm pretty sure this is the place. Well, uh, my name's Patrick Sharp. Patrick. So that's this address, I don't know anybody else in the building. Are there any photographers in this building at all? Not that I know of, but I can ask around. Must be some sort of mistake. Um... how did you get up here? Look, uh... if you, uh... if you see her, ple-- please, please don't hesitate to call. Yeah, absolutely, my God. Beside myself. What was that? What was what? You know, they're kinda thin walls. I think-- I think somebody's doing something upstairs. So maybe you wanna check up there. Hey, hey! Okay, let's go. Who are you? I'm sorry, I thought I heard something. Well, let's go. Do you like your new home? I'm the building manager, Isobel. Nobody knows this place better than I do. I can get onto any floor or into any apartment faster than anyone. I'm sorry you had to spend the night in there, it's just that, I thought we had an understanding. If I let you out, will you be a good girl? Look at me. I'd like it if I don't have to do this again. Okay? Go ahead. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Okay, okay. Okay, there you go. Take a breath, take a breath. Okay. Let's eat. According to your profile page, breakfast is your favorite meal, no? So. You met my daughter. I have her on weekends. Eat. There's nothing in it. Mm, so good. Come on. Olivia has her first school play tonight. Well, kids are resilient. She won't even remember this. Yes, she will. She'll never forget it. She'll forgive you. You're a good mom. You know, no one ever got out before. You're smart. I like you. How did you know Nancy's number? I told you, I know everything. I know where you went to high school, when you had your last vacation, I have your Pilates schedule. Everything in your phone is in my computer, so... it really does not matter that you know where I live or that my real name's Patrick. Because the people I work with, they also have your information, you understand? It's what we call insurance, for when I let you go. 750 North King's Road. Olivia's school, right? You don't want her next play date to be with me, do you? Can I trust you, Isobel? You stay away from my daughter. Do we have a deal? Do you have it, a condom, too? Do you? I, I have AIDS. Don't worry. I have AIDS, too. No, no. No, no. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come and eat something-- You okay? Come back, come back. Come on. There you go. You all right? Why did you cut me down? Why did you cut me down, why did you cut me down? Come on. Don't be selfish, Isobel. You have other people to think about. Think about your baby. How's Olivia gonna feel if you give up on her sibling? I can't go home like this. I can't go home like this. Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh. You have to be strong. You have to be a survivor. My daughter found this kitty in a box. My daughter went home. Why don't you take care of her? You can have her when you're off the clock. Who is Chloe, when we took the pictures? Just some girl. Craigslist. She didn't have a clue, did she? Even made her call me. You need some rest. Drink your water. Why didn't you just take her? Why me? You walked in, you sat down nearby. And I knew I could sell you. Shh, it's fine. It's fine. It's okay. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Isobel. It's time to wake up. I need you to get ready. No. - Yes. - No. Mm-hm. - Don't take it, don't. - Yeah. It's time to go to work. - I can't do it. - Yes, you can. I need a doctor. Okay. I'll take care of it. I need one to come here and take a look at me. I nearly died in there. I can do one better. Look at me. Isobel, this one is the last one, forever. Then you can go home, you can be with your family. Why should I believe you? Because I don't wanna have to cut you down from the ceiling again. He's not a violent one. He won't hurt you. He's on his way. So, you've got about, ooh, you got about 15 minutes, okay? I saw your photo collection upstairs of the girls. What happened to them? What happened to them? The good ones went home. And... and the bad ones? And who's coming, very important. So I need you to look your best. There's some makeup and something to wear in the bag. Why is he so important? Big spender, huh? What you do now affects the rest of your life. You satisfy him... or else. No wrinkles. You must be Isobel. Your reputation, most certainly precedes you. What do you think? Think I look pretty? Tell me how pretty I look. I wanna hear it. You're an important man, aren't you? I love important men. Should I feel special? Yes, I feel so special. Yes, you like that? Don't worry, I've been looking forward to this more than you have. Mm, look at that. Look at this handsome chest, mm. You enjoying this? Tell me you're enjoying this. Jacket. Did you forget the rules? No sharp objects. I-- I thought I could let her do her own makeup. On your knees. Now. I said no fuckin' wrinkles. What kind of a man gets on his knees for another man? You mean nothing to me. Look at me when I'm speaking to you. She's worth more to me than you. Ah. Open your fuckin' mouth. Next week, you pay double, and if you don't, your daughter's gonna replace this whore. Understood? Good. Now, I need to go change my shirt for the opera. Ah. Door. That way. Now, why would you do that? How could you possibly think this would help you? - Ow. - Come here. Stay still. Stay still. You are never gonna let me go, you sick fuck! Hey, hey! I was never going home. - No. - Right? - Right. - Yes. - Sit still. - Did all the other girls fall for the same stupid website shit I fell for, huh? - Yeah. - 20 years experience of shooting fashion and models. Distinguished eye for... I'm done. I am done. No, you're not. No, you're not. Do you hear me? Yes, I'm done! - No! - Yes! Mark will take care of Olivia and you can drink your fucking milk! I'd rather be dead than fuck for you! Stay still. Ah! All right, you wanna be dead? Oh, you. Stubborn, stupid girl. I'm not the sick one. My daughter is. We had a good thing. Spare a dollar? Hello, Isobel. You're looking well. Though they're treating your harshly. Such a pity. Ah. You have lovely toes. Beautiful. Always keep the needle with the eye point upwards so that it will penetrate with the sharpest end. Excuse me. Hello. Yes, I'm in the process of doing it now. What? I--I don't understand. Yes, but I've always done this myself. Yes, of course. You are in charge. Well, my love. You must be very special. It seems your friend wants to give the last shot himself. Goodbye, Isobel. I gave you every opportunity. You could be in Eastern Europe... or Moscow. Instead, they're gonna find your corpse in some back alley. You cost me, Isobel, and this is the price you pay. You know why you haven't set up your Pilates studio yet? Because you're not smart enough. You lack the intellect. My daughter's smarter than you. She'd never come to some stranger's apartment. Twice. People like you end up here. Rightfully so. You were made to serve others. That's who you are. So, why not serve me? I didn't trap you here, Isobel. You trapped yourself. But now, it's time to say goodbye. - Help! - Ma'am, back up. - Open the door! - Step away from the car. - Open it! - Step away from the car. Ma'am, are you all right? Are you hurt?
