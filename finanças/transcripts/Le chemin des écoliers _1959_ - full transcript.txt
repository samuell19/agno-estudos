There you go! - Time to come up? - No, Yvette. You needn't stay long. You know very well. Remember the other day. It's my fault. Next time we're not going to the pictures. No, we're going to the pictures... and spending the evening together... with all that follows, right? Definitely. Definitely, or probably? Have you spoken to your parents? I haven't had the chance. What will you say to them? I'll say Tiercelin invited me to his country home for Easter. - Not a good idea? - Depends on your parents. I won't tell them it's a fib... that I'll be with you in Paris. You're a really bad liar. You really need to spend 15 days alone with me. I reckon so. A serious need. "Need" or desire? Antoine, what time did you get in last night? - You were asleep. - That's not an answer. At midnight. I ran all the way from Tiercelin's. You were at the pictures, of course. - What's that? - Hot chocolate. - And that's real butter. - He gets it from his friend, Tiercelin. That name again. His dad's got a restaurant. He's got everything. That's what I don't like. It's not black-market. It's bartered. Let's not play with words. He wanted me to get him a banned American novel. I told him to give me some chocolate... and butter. Let's hope this time it's a decent American book. Talking of Tiercelin, guess what he's suggested? To take him to Burgundy for the Easter holidays. - You agreed? - I don't see why not. It's a matter of discretion. You can't deny him a trip to the country. Look at him. He needs fresh air and sunshine. He's sleeping in class. It's you who's pasty-faced. Maybe, but I can't ask his friend to take me. Why not? We could just go. We'll show up there, all four of us. "Good day. This is the Michaud family". Right, where's the butter? But if you don't agree... It's up to you... to decide, Charles. Fine. You can stay with Tiercelin. Thanks, dad. Don't mention it. Thanks, mum. - Going to school? - Yes. - Can I come? - Sure. - What's on this morning? - Chemistry and History. An unusual concoction. You mean the chocolate? I'm not talking about this. The reaction is written: 4CIH + MnO2 = 2H2O + Cl2Mn... Any news on the coffins? It fell through. Shame, it had potential. I've got something better... champagne! Champagne. That's on again? 2000 bottles. The bloke's just been busy elsewhere. I've revived the deal. - Got transport sorted? - Through Yvette. She's sure of him. He's called Lulu. He's already done it. And he's not too greedy, either. - What about the Germans? - Guess what... he'll drive the lorry himself wearing a German uniform. Great stuff! Enough said. What's he doing there? I punished him. Sit back down. By what right did you punish him? Sorry, but I don't allow disrespect. He disrespected you? Pull down your skirt. You'll catch cold. That's not a sight for a child... nor for M. Oliver or me. Certainly not, Madam. It's impossible right now, I haven't got any. I understand, but... Not for three weeks, if you're lucky. Goodbye, Madam. What was that? The people from 4e, Monge Road. They've smashed the toilet bowl. Why were you yelling? We'll replace it. Really, this very morning? No, but as soon as possible. We've got some toilets. What about the tax? You're not going to make them wait 3 weeks? They'll hold on. And when they've held on long enough... they'll be happy to take a toilet off our hands. For 5000 F. No. We're not black marketeers exploiting tenants. Solange! We're intermediaries for entrepreneurs. If toilets are unavailable... They are not! They will be! Take a letter for 4e, Monge Road. "Dear Madam, further to our telephone conversation... I am pleased..." What's this all about? It's about the difficult times we are living in... "I am pleased to inform you that our agent..." If there remains but one honest business... It'll be ours. Too bad if we go bust. "...will be in touch about replacing the toilet." Our business won't fail, but it will be above-board. - As toilet suppliers. - With a smile. Keep your chin up. His lordship has spoken. Where was I? "...replacing the toilet." You big chicken, hypocrite! You're a spiv and a crook, so screw you! "Yours faithfully, etc." Get it typed at once. Bear in mind, I'm a pig. Me too. So what about the Bourgogne trip? Agreed, even though my dad moaned about it. - 10 days with Yvette. - Great stuff. Tell me... when you spend all night with a woman... how long do you make love for? - And how often? - As few as possible. No marks for quantity, so you wear yourself out for nothing. - I'm serious. - Me too! Hello. Hello Sir. - Hello kids. - Hello dad - Mr. Tiercelin. Two tickets for the boxing if you want them? Not tonight, I've got homework. Oh, sorry I spoke. Bravo. Marcel, serve us at the usual table. M. Tiercelin... about the champagne. - Yes. - You don't know the best bit. The driver's dressed as a German soldier. Really? I'm going to give you some advice. You talk too much. I don't want to hear any more about it or you. Your dad's not very nice. You've made 200,000F. Do you want a smile on top? Do you mind if I join you now? You're fine where you are. Aren't you with Flora? Women, you know... It's just a physical thing. You court them, get naked, it all takes time, and for what? No, there are better things to do at our age. It doesn't stop us doing other things. It does. Look at yourself. Honestly, you don't look too clever. You're clever enough for both of us. It's no laughing matter. But I love her and I'm not ashamed of it. - Here. - No, thanks. See, love is like tobacco. When you first smoke you think you're really someone. When I realised that, I gave it up. I'm giving up women too. That's up to you. Is it so important to sleep with Yvette? It just makes me happy. What's so much more important than sleeping with Flora? - I need to keep in shape. - In shape for what? Oh, I nearly forgot. Your cut for the sugar job. Thanks. Now you can pay her for the week. What does that mean? Yvette loves me. Maybe. But I wonder if she'd love you without the cash. She's never asked for money. You don't give her time to ask. You just give it. Goodbye. Give her my love. No, really! Ah, back to normal. - What's yours? - A glass of milk. - You're drinking milk now! - Oh don't make that face. What's wrong with my face? You could be a bit nicer to me. Don't forget my businessman from Dinan. I sent him packing. He worshipped me like the Madonna... every other Friday. Why not give "Dinan" a call? Serve you right if I did. And you're a pig. If you cheat on me again... - Excuse me. - Don't I get a kiss? - You don't like milk. - What about later? I have to work. Oh, your lad. When you were his age... Paul's an intellectual, old boy. Baccalaureate. Didn't you know? Ain't it the truth. If you're educated, you can exploit other men. Otherwise, you can only exploit floozies. With education you can be a civil servant or a piano teacher. Sorry for not being jealous. Maybe you're right, but Paul is different. He's a street-wise intellectual. Have you seen him with Flora? No long words. He just tells her what's what. Believe me, he's a chip off the old block. Your go. Watch it! Morning! - Is your mum in? - Yes. - Did you go to the dentist. - It didn't hurt. You're a brave girl. - Is that you? - Yes. You're late. But I've got two bits of news. - The champagne deal worked out? - Yes. That's what interests you most, eh? And second? - I can't think. - Try. - No idea... tell me. - Try harder. - Think of a man. - A man? - Do I know him? - Better you didn't! - Your dad? What did he say? - Despite himself... I knew he'd say yes. You "knew!" So, I'm off to Burgundy. I love the countryside. Let's lie on the grass. Wait, I'll get rid of Chou. Go to the concierge and read your book. I've read it. Well, look at the pictures. We need two now. I knew he'd say yes. Come in. Looking after the place? I want to go home, I'm bored. Back you go then. I can't reach the bell. Ok let's go. - Any news of your dad? - Yes, he's in a salad. Not a salad, a stalag. Sta-lag. - It's a camp full of prisoners. - What did they do wrong? Nothing really. They didn't do anything. - Must dash. - Had your fun and you're off. Coming! Honest, I haven't even started tomorrow's homework. You and your homework! Sorry, but this young... The concierge left me all alone. There was no need M. Coutelier. You are too kind. M. Coutelier, could you do me a favour? - If I can. - You certainly can. It's for a friend in my flat. Come. Antoine! Come here. This is M. Coutelier. He'll do your homework. - What homework? - I don't know, tell him. I'm not sure it's a good idea. - I'm a bit embarrassed, sir. - M. Coutelier is a teacher. - Was. - So what... you haven't forgotten? My friend has homework for tomorrow, but no time to do it. - I don't see... - It's not brain surgery. Do his homework, name your price and everyone's happy. I think I follow you, but this is an unusual deal you're suggesting. And they say the French should help each other. Perhaps the young man thinks I'll do a poor job. At the end of the day... Good or bad, a job's a job. What's it worth? 200? - At least. - Please... 300? It's quite absurd. If you prefer, I've got plenty of food. Milk, coffee, chocolate, cooking oil... - It's about patriotism. - What is? My homework. "Patriotism Does Not Hinder Humanitarianism: The Reverse Is True." - I haven't done it, because I disagree. - Who with? You're wrong, it's a great subject. I know what you think. "The Motherland, Patria, the land of our forefathers." You don't broaden the idea of ancestry, you deepen it. There, you know all about it. Give him the money. Not too long-winded. He's got to copy it out. Excuse my amazement. So young and so much money. OK, be amazed. And make the most of it. - You spoke rather unkindly. - He was happy to take the money. No need to be cruel though. Oh, I adore you. Here, if you've still got room. Well, Antoine, binoculars! I mustn't deprive you. It's for your rambles across Burgundy. - They'll slow me down. - Of course not. Walks aren't just for exercise. They are for thinking and looking as well. He'll only break them. Right, that makes more sense. I'm not keen on Germans, but when it comes to optics... At least they get something right. - Don't be late. - No. - I'm off. - Got all you need? Yes, thanks. Ok, here we go. My dear mother... - You'll write? - Soon as I get there. Don't go on. Letters to parents... - No, I promise. - Won't you give him some money? Err... of course. How much do you need? Apart from my ticket, I won't spend anything. Yes, but I'm a little worried... you'll end up somewhere... where things are more expensive. - Don't ruin his excitement. - Well, he'll need a bit more. Let's see, how much? 1000F. But mum, that's too much. I don't know, 500? Here son, take 1000 as requested. Not by you... by your mother. Thanks, dad. Hang on, it's not small change. At least put it in your wallet. Damn! I left it in my room. At least I hope so. - There, what a relief! - Jolly good. Now, you must be off, Antoine. Yes, but it pains me to leave you. Hey, don't get sloppy. You're going, we're staying. Breath fresh air for all the family. Away with you. Good. Right, I'm off. Be decisive, you're not going that far away. An aeroplane. Here comes the alarm. Oh blimey, I must dash! - 'Bye, dad. - Goodbye, son. - 'Bye, you. - Your coat. Can't see anything. No flak. Daddy, come in a bit. Binoculars are forbidden. Oh, yes. Wait, I can see something at the dairy. From 11am, distribution of cooking oil. March DH vouchers. Quickly, Pierrette. Get in the queue. Those kids are sweet. Boo! Here I am! It's you. Aren't you glad to see me? Yes, but Lulu isn't here yet. Oh, he'll come. I'm not so sure. - What's that? - His uniform, of course. He ripped it up the back. It's not worth the trouble to fix. He said 11am. If he's had a problem... After all, we're talking about 200,000F. C'mon, you'll get it. And I'm getting a lovely present. You've already bought it? What is it? - How do you like it? - It's smashing. - You really like it? - Yes. And it fits a treat. But what can I give you? - I'm really a bit worried. - Why? Well, you see.. I said to myself, "200,000F..." That's not all of course... but it's daft to sit on it. It gets frittered away, everything gets dearer... and soon it's not worth anything. - Aren't I right? - I think I follow. You're teasing me. My ideas are basic economics. Of course, but what's new? I did mention it. It's about Lucienne, she sometimes gets second-hand furs. I know her. I'm concerned because sheepskin is common... mink's out of the question... astrakhan's for old ladies, right? Absolutely, so what's left? Actually, she has an Ocelot. That's spot on, gorgeous. - A pretty little animal. - And easy to wear. - It fits me. - Got it here? No, but I reserved it with a 30,000F deposit. But I'm worried if I don't come up with the balance now... The furrier! - Is it you? - Who does it look like! - Know what happened? - No. Paul dumped me. - On your own? - No, Antoine's here. Do you realise? A boy I've spent a year of my life on... teaching him how to dress. He leaves me in this state... For what reason, eh? Really... why do you think? - I don't know. - The best bit!... Sir is too young for a girlfriend and must revise for his Bac. I swear, of all the words to use. His Baccalaureate! To dare to say that to a woman! To my face! - Here's Paul. - Ah, there you are. You needn't say a word, he knows. Tell me you don't! - He told you? - No. Listen to him lie! He's just Paul's little poodle. Go and play with Chou. Please, go. The little sod. You're not going to cry over him? This is getting me down. He's not worth it! No lousy punter lays down the law to me! He's going to beg forgiveness. He'll crawl at my feet, he'll lick the pavement... and when he wants to get up, I'll say: "Just to make up..." Well, we'll see. You'll see, what's waiting for you. What does Paul want of Antoine? All the work he'll dump on you. - He said that? - Pretty much. Do as you will. Unlike me, you've been warned. Let Paul try it on. I'm not scared of him! It's different. I mean everything to Antoine. - What do you mean to Paul? - Well, thank you! Here he is! - Paul? - No, Lulu. I don't want to see anyone. - Hi! - Hello. - Well, you had me going. - Nervous are you? - Relax, eh? - Here, everything's ready. Yvette! Look after him, I'll be right back. She's in a state, eh? Here. Good. Now! This looks OK. All woman can sew, even if they won't admit it. - Alright? - Of course. This will outlast the war. Not that I'm the military type. On the contrary... I can't stand peaked caps, with or without stripes. Like this, I'll put the wind up everyone... cops or customs. Not that I'll be looking for them. But if they stop the lorry, well! I'll show myself: "Attention!" and they'll shut up. That's when I like coppers... when they want to gob in my face but they have to swallow their spit. Ok, let's get going. Yvette, I'll be right back! - What sort of truck? - Brand new, runs on wood-gas. She'll do over 40 miles an hour. Which route are you taking? I don't know yet... depends on the situation. I sometimes go by the main road. I'll definitely return via Saint-Denis... from there, all the way along the canal. And then along the back-streets to the warehouse. See you. Good luck, eh? Why? Are you worried? No, but it's my first big score. I don't want it to fail. You'll never make it. - You don't know me. - Here. - Everything OK here? - Very good. - Is it good? - It's top notch. You shouldn't drink this with it. I told him that. But tonight, M. Tiercelin, it's Burgundy. - Burgundy with everything. - He's researching. Evening. - You know Burgundy? - I like to think so. Tell him what to tell his father. Learn the wine list by heart like me. Right, bon appétit. And have a good holiday. - What about my letters home? - What letters? On holiday you write home. It's all done. You write home straight way? It grieves me to lie to his father. I'm really suffering. Hey! Aren't you? Oh, please. Good, you too. So I said to myself, one small way to stop the pain... is for Antoine to really... go to the country. With me, of course. You're quite mad. We clear up the champagne business, pocket the cash and... - leave tomorrow? - But Yvette and I... Who mentioned Yvette? Same thing. Yvette? Antoine's a free agent. There you go! You're forgetting one thing. Antoine and me... have decided never to part. And is it tactless to ask how you intend to live? Like now. Antoine will conduct his business. He's got no customers. He'll get some. Try it. I'll work too. Now we're in fairyland. What a thing to say! Say something! We can do without lots of money. Meanwhile, you're enjoying your fur coat. Just because you've been a cad to Flora... Thank you. - M. Tiercelin? - Yes? - Telephone. - Who is it? M. Dominique. I'll take it in the booth. Bon appétit. Excuse me. You know, I'm not moaning... but I prefer sausage to eel. Right, I'll see what I can do. Hello, is that you, Dominique? What's up? OK, good. Fine, wait a second. Roger, get M. Paul. Sure. Right, then what? M. Paul, your father wants you in the booth. - Are you angry? - It's always like this with you and Paul. You know I can't cross him. I really do need him. - More than me? - Don't be silly. If you were a real... You could do without Paul. A real man? I didn't say that. You said enough. Finished? - Coffee? - No thanks. Kids, if you want to live without money... now's the time. Goodbye champagne. The police have found the warehouse. - Oh, my God! - And Lulu? Sorry, he's a pal, but... That's lousy. Can't we do anything? What? I don't know which way he went. We're completely buggered. You don't know, do you? No. What are you doing? - Where are you going? - To find Lulu. But how? - You're mad! - I know his route. And you didn't tell Paul? If I were a real man, I could do without Paul. - But I didn't say that! - Sure, and you won't say it again. Darling, what about the curfew? - Bollocks to the curfew. - Don't. Lulu will manage. - It's not about Lulu. - I don't care about the money. It's not the money either! Lulu! Lulu! Stop! We're here. Go right at the end. Stop! Stop Lulu! Stop! Lulu Stop! - What's all the confusion? - Shall I scatter them? Don't be stupid. Stop and watch. I won't... let them fuck me up. - What's going on? - Excuse us, we're after him. Do you have permission to be out at night? What's the boy done? Hanging on to the lorry. And there's a curfew. I am giving him permission. Were you tired? - Yes, Sir. - OK, get in. If I left him, you'd take him to the station. I'll take him to his parents... which will show we Germans are human beings too. Heil Hitler! What's happening? Forget Dominique... the police are there. What? A letter from Antoine! - Surprised? - I didn't expect it so soon. It's almost worrying. All is fine. And a long one. "Dear dad, mum, Pierrette..." "having a great time although I'm on my feet all the time." I told him time and again to stay put. "Dad will say serves me right, I should have stayed put." Right. "The weather was great so we went straight... "for a walk in the forest. "We took Gribouille, the farmer's dog... "a big, bonny, gentle animal". - Like a dutiful son, he rattles on. - Oh... don't mock. I'm only joking. Actually, I find it really moving. "The mo... the..." What awful handwriting. What's the matter, sweetheart? Nothing, just thinking of Antoine. I need a handkerchief. What's going on? - Surely, she's not jealous? - Dunno. "... A big, bonny, gentle animal." "The flowers aren't yet in bloom..." "all was quiet..." - Oh my God! - What is it? Your son's end-of-term report... this gentleman who waxes about farmers' dogs. - What does it say? - I don't understand. He was always near top of the class. Remember his Xmas report? It was perfect. Look at this. 22nd, 13th, 8th. - 8th? - There's only 9 doing German! And his teachers' comments: "Easing off", "In freefall". Right, for starters... this young man is coming home tomorrow. What do you think? I really don't know. Perhaps he's tired. He's as fit as a fiddle. He's just letting things slide. Perhaps something's happened to him. I'd like to know what could happen to a 17 year old boy... to whom nothing has ever happened. A love affair? What? A love affair? That's a good one! A love affair. That's just perfect. "A love affair". Thanks, little Chou. Might one ask when you'll be making the announcement? Yes, smart-aleck, one might. They'll look everywhere for their baby if you hide him from them. I'm well aware. I've thought about it. - How do you like my stockings? - Ravishing! - Here, draw my seams. - OK. The problem is that he can't fail to go home. Suppose the police were after Antoine? - "The police"? - I said "suppose". In that case, he'd have to disappear. - Correct. - Good, you get it. A policeman goes to his house... and says... that tickles... ...they're after him for something and where is he? They say they don't know. Next day, Antoine writes to them: "Don't worry, I'm in a safe place." That way he doesn't go home... and everyone's happy. Right? Yes. Yes, the fake policeman scam. Got someone in mind? Better than that, sweetie. - The Gestapo. - Don't wriggle about. Yeah, me, I've got a uniform. He'll do the job for Antoine. Perfect. You owe him a favour. Without his intervention, I'd be doing porridge. You're OK with this? Of course he is. Aren't you? Oh, you know me... But what about your parents... It's for their benefit. You don't understand. When he's there he lies to them all the time. Do you think it's good to live like that? Believe me... it's best. One big whopper... then no more lies. It's more honest, don't you agree? So what now? - Lulu can go now. - No, this evening. I don't want my mother to be alone. You're a good son. My dad is home at 6.30. No messing about, OK? Children, each does what he may. I'll get the money from the lorry. Right. He saves it and you bank it. If it's OK with you... - Look after it, mate. - Glad to be of service. He's right. He did nothing. You look after it. You see? A right little home-maker. Not cross are you, sweetie? I adore you! What out for my stockings! Got you, you little perv! You little rascal! At your age! Disgusting! What if I told your mum? And crafty too. Taking advantage when I drop my pencil. Shame on you! And I trusted you! What I saw was most regrettable. But, M. Michaud, it wasn't what it looked like. He's always after me, annoying me, groping me... and talking dirty. Sometimes I'm quite scared. You wouldn't think so. Don't pretend that at your ages... how old is he? I wouldn't know. At least 16. - Don't you know yourself? - 16? It's just as I was saying. You led him on. - Admit it. - How am I supposed to know? With the stress of this war, morals are hard to maintain. We live on our nerves. Hi. Hi. Caught in the act! Precisely. Go. And behave yourselves. What's new? Anything? Yes. My son has a mistress. Really? Good boy! Since when? Don't know. I've only just found out. Not Solange, surely? Ah no, you couldn't understand. How did you find out? For some time he's done sod-all at school. - Bunking off? - Worse. Bottom in everything with zero. - What will you do? - I haven't a clue. Think about it. Hopefully I'll have time to see what's coming. At least he won't be with her in the country. - Has she got no legs? - What do you mean? - She couldn't go with him? - You could be right. Yeah! Perhaps Tiercelin is in the same boat. I'll go and see the father. I'd be doing him a favour. - That'll be nicer. - Thanks. Waiter! Bill please. 25 on 100. Excuse me, barman. The lady at the table over there... with the gentleman and the girl. Where's that? I'm sure I know her. Isn't she the person who runs a very... - hospitable place? - 62, rue La Bruyère? Exactly. A very nice house. I'll pass on your thanks. She's my aunt. - The man is my father. - Forgive me, I didn't realise. Don't worry about it. I recognise him over there. He comes to me off-duty. He's a northern industrialist. - You're pulling my leg. - No. From northern Germany. They're northerners too, aren't they? He could be useful. Easy does it, Lucette. I've had some hot tips. The invasion's coming this Spring. Believe me, now is not the time... to get involved with them. It's best to remain good Frenchmen. - And if the Germans bugger off? - There'll be the Americans. That's true. I'm being daft. Yes, Sir? Nothing thanks. I'd just like to speak to M. Tiercelin. - And who wants him? - M. Michaud. He doesn't know me, but my son Antoine and his son are friends. I'll speak to him. I've got an old man's cold. - Did you say I was here? - He'd only come back. What can I say to him? I dunno. Cover for Antoine. See what he wants. I swear... you and your schemes... Tell him I'm coming. What do I say to him? Don't wet yourself. You only need to look at him. Good job, not a piss-head. I've told you not to talk like that. It makes you sound common. He's a PhD. Think about it. This isn't about a baccalaureate. Still, those types aren't much fun. It depends. When I was in Royan... there was this registrar, bald and educated. You wouldn't believe it, but he used to have us in stitches. Tiercelin. M. Tiercelin, I hesitated to come and see you. Not so much "see" as talk to. We're talking father to father. I hear you. Well, I'm worried about both our sons. You know these two lads are in the country. A late thank-you for the invitation, but... But? It's this very trip of which I am suspicious. You think they didn't go? No. I got a letter from Antoine this morning. Jolly good. I don't understand. What's the problem? M. Tiercelin, for certain reasons... my wife and I have come to wonder... if this little journey isn't hiding certain... young peoples' secrets. For example? If it might be about a wee escapade... where they aren't totally alone. They're with some birds... young women? There, we're thinking along the same lines. Not at all. You can rest assured, because your son, pardon... I don't know him, but as far as my Paul goes... I'd be bleeding gob-smacked. Excuse my language. - I just admire your confidence. - It's not that. As far as women are concerned, I've taken precautions. Precautions? Well, I just did what I could. It's not complicated. The day Paul reached 14, I gave him total license... At 14? It's the only way to stop them playing with themselves. We can chat as easily sitting down eh? My word... Actually, I was with my sister. I'm embarrassed. I'm in the way. She'll be delighted to meet you. Lucette, this is M. Michaud, Antoine's dad. Madam. Sit down, M. Michaud. Make yourself comfortable. Thank you. This here is Olga. She works with my sister. She owns a beauty parlour. She lends a hand. - It seems as if the lady... - "The lady"... Oh, nothing. I was just trying to be gallant. - Oh, don't be shy. - Please, be gallant. The moment is lost. I'd have to recap. Oh, please. Start over. We've plenty of time. OK, here we go. M. Tiercelin said that this lady owns a beauty parlour... and this young lady helps her. I just wanted to say... this lady needs no help in matters of beauty. But... if anyone could help... it's this lady here. Here. - Just a drop. - Of course. Thank you. We were chatting about our kids' education. On a rather delicate point: Relations between boys and girls. Nothing wrong with that. We weren't talking about hanky-panky. What a pity. Listen to her. Actually, the problem isn't the same... for a boy as for a girl. - It's actually quite the reverse. - Compliments, for example. Although they have the same curiosities, that need looking at. As you say: "they need looking at". Lucette... remember, no hanky-panky. Oh no, M. Tiercelin, we're not talking about that. Mind you, at the end of the day... I could, perhaps, just like any other man... although not for much longer at my age. How old are you? Already too old to confess. - I wouldn't say that. - And actually, nor would I. Olga... Nothing naughty's going on. Don't let us all die of thirst. Sorry. Hang on. You're getting married this year. - Same again, please. - Sure. - Thanks Paul. - Don't mention it. Marcel, another bottle for the table. Keep an eye open for Antoine and explain. - What are you up to? - Don't worry. Pretty soon, Michaud the father will be less critical of Michaud the son. Go! Olga, Olga! You can't leave her for a minute. Sorry, but when she takes a shine to someone... Whatever will the gentleman think of you? Good point. What do you think of me? Nothing less than really lovely. There, you see? Like all men, you see bad things everywhere. Whereas M. Michaud, at least, is not a cad. I may have my faults like everyone but... you couldn't really say I'm a cad. Gestapo. - M. Michaud? - He's not in. - And Mme Michaud? - She's out as well. - When is she in? - I don't know. - May I wait? - No! But I must come in. Right, open up. We'll be back later. I've only known you 10 minutes, but I'm already holding your hand. It's probably seems natural to you, but not for me. I'll even kiss it if I can? It's not difficult. True. Right now, I'm so happy, Olga. May I call you Olga? Of course you don't mind. I'm even happy to be happy, if you know what I mean. Surely. Anyway, it doesn't matter if you don't understand. Yes... As happy right now as if the war were over. I feel great, you know. Me too, you know. Does it show? I'd say so, and I ask myself why. - Perhaps I fancy you. - "Perhaps"? What's happening is really weird. And quite moving, isn't it? Don't move, don't stir... Let's stay quite still. Shall we stay or move on? It would be the same. You couldn't give me any more. Oh, I certainly could! Of course, but what could I give you? I'm not too young and I'm not too handsome. Why do you say that? Because... It's not important right now. "Right now". I've never said "right now" as often as right now. And between the two of us, what might happen? Just a wee moment of foolishness, eh? And rightly so. Why ever not? Yes. "Rightly so"... "Why ever not?" Eh? It's never happened to you before? Perhaps I've never met someone who'd be foolish with me. There's a chance it could be me. Yes, a very good chance, Olga. Olga's back. - Were you on holiday? - Yes, I was in Royan. - Do you know it. - Yes, I've been there. What are they building down there? The Atlantic Sea Wall. That's about all it'll hold back. I think it'll do its job. - Without wishing to contradict... - Well, it looks pretty solid. And this gentleman should know. He's in the artillery. - Captain Hatzfeld. - I doubt it. Michaud. These Parisian bars are so charming... one can somewhat relax proprieties. - Really? - Yes, really. Ok, let's be informal. Dear Captain, you've lost the war. We've conquered everywhere... France, Russia, Greece, Norway. But it's always possible we'll lose this war. So, we'll win the next one. There won't be a next one. Sir, you don't know Germany. Olga. Sir. Wow, you've got some bottle! Quite a chat. What's happening here? I've wanted to get that off my chest for a long time. Now I've done it. That's what's so amazing about being with you. Coming? But he'll think he scared me. Do you think he understood? Come on. May I? There. - Off already? - We live near each other. - She doesn't know where I live. - Beware, she's a great guesser. - Excuse me. - Of course. From the boss. Please give my best to your lady sister. She thought you were very nice. - See you soon, I hope. - I hope so too. After you. Did the barman give you a billet-doux? - Is that you? - Yes, it's me. I'm a wee bit late. I couldn't get away from Tiercelin. What a charming man. - Charles... - Yes? Oh, darling... What's on earth's happened? The Gestapo came. - The Gestapo? - A German. Pierrette was here all alone. Pierrette? - Weren't you scared? - A bit, yes. - What did he say? - Nothing. He's coming back. - Nothing else? - No. - What did he want? - I don't know. Tell me. Are you hiding something? Come on. Of course not. Let's think... we don't know anything. I don't listen to the radio. I don't know any Jews. Not by design, that's just how it is. - Oh, my God! - What? There's not been enough time. But it's just possible. Good grief! What is it? I had a confrontation with a german officer. At Tiercelin's. What an idiot. He knows my name. Are you crazy? Not really. He gave me his. You M. Michaud? That's me. I want to speak to your son Antoine. Ahh... my son. - I want to speak to him. - He's not here. I doubt that. Where is he? On holiday. I don't know where. You give him a big freedom, I think. Yes, very big. And he uses it to make dangerous activities for himself. Hang on, sir. I think I know my son... We know him too. What has he done? My mission is not to answer questions, just to find him. By refusing to divulge her whereabouts... ...HIS whereabouts... you make things worse. I can't tell you any more, sir. Very well, we'll be back. Perhaps it's not so serious. Don't be over concerned. Rotten hypocrite. Oh dear... well I never! What luck he wasn't here. But Tiercelin clearly reassured me... - they are in the country. - Let's hope they stay. Right. - Daddy? - Yes? - He's not in the country. - What do you mean? I saw him yesterday riding a bike. He didn't see me. - Why didn't you tell us? - You're certain about this? Yes. I didn't want to tell tales. That's why I cried over his letter. But that letter... Clearly an alibi. He knew we'd check up on him. That's why he scarpered. Dear old Antoine. Why didn't he confide in us. Easy. A secret need to hide himself. Even from his parents. No wonder his school work was suffering. And the look on his face. His lateness... and all the lousy excuses he made up. And when he had to take the so-called train... he wasn't going anywhere, poor thing. - And I hurried him along. - Poor Antoine, I'm ashamed. - We were idiots. - We just didn't understand. M. And Mme Michaud, who have never taken a risk in their lives... nevertheless have an amazing son. - They are as proud as can be. - Oh, yes. We are proud. We mustn't show it, but we are. Remember I said: "Well get through these momentous times..." with nothing happening to us". Well, I was wrong. Antoine happened to us. We want to tell him that. We want to embrace him... but we must rejoice that he's not here. He's not here, so how can we warn him. Well, perhaps through Tiercelin. But he confirmed they were in the country. All the more reason. What if his son also... Certainly, yes. I'm coming. Ladies, gentlemen. A little cognac. There we are. It's OK, we're just showing off the omelette. Won't be long. It's a power cut. I'll make a call. Here. - Barman? - Yes? - Is M. Tiercelin here? - There's a power cut. But it's... - Light! - Don't switch it off. That man who came in... I must see M. Tiercelin. Get him at once. It's very serious. It's vital for his son. OK. Lulu! Hey, Lulu! Over here. - Sorry, I was famished. - No harm done. I had to change. How did it go? - Fine. - Paul's bringing the money. Fancy some oysters? They're good again. No thanks. How's the paté? Want a taste? Well? - How did they take it? - I needed two trips. - Was it hard? - In a way. Was my mother there? - Yes, she was there! - We did it for love. You can shut up! You might have killed her! Murderer! That's what you are. My son is an assassin. What have you done? This disgusting farce. You lying scoundrel! You pimp and his whore! Sir! Don't be so rude! You can shut up too. All these lies! The Gestapo, the Resistance. Feeling sorry for you. Admiring you. You make me sick! This time, the Gestapo will be after you for real. You great coward! Dirty little thief! Don't worry, they'll be after you too! - I was just helping out. - Her too. Statutory rape, if there's any justice left in France! - Him again, bugger! - He said it was serious. Too right. I need to sort something quick. Come and listen to this. Enough drama, we're here to eat! Pain in the bum. Give us a break. - Enough! - That'll do! Give over! And the same to you! Drink champagne and stuff yourselves, while others perish! You too! Shut your traps and let me speak for honest men! They've no more shoes, but they'll still kick your arses. Hear, hear! Well said! Got it? Get drunk if it makes you happy! - What's going on? - See for yourself. - Someone should call the police. - That's just what I want. No, no trouble. No police. - They don't frighten me! - Enough! What's happening my darling? Don't shout. You'll make yourself ill. Hey, there's Yvette. I didn't know you two were friends. So what? Who is this handsome lad? Is he your son? Come on, dad. M. Michaud... these are some papers that concern Antoine. I'm giving them to you. - That's the champagne money? - Including my share. Thief. You should have given it to me. It's better where it is. That was well done, Olga. You're a nice bastard. What is sir's pleasure? And who is she, this... Yvette. One of those women you find in bars. Right, well... Time to sleep. If you can. What on earth is this? Is it yours? It's the money I made from the champagne job. Champagne? What's more, the black market. Well, anyway... There should be 400,000. 400,000F? - Including Paul's share. - Well, bully for you! You're so humble, that 200,000 is enough. How come, Antoine... such a sum? It was outstanding. A fantastic scam. A lorry... Oh, please! You see, he's the complete package. - 400,000F! - That's not the point! If it were just 1000F, it wouldn't make it any better. Good grief, you... Sure, but after today we can't be shocked any more. Well, I can be shocked again! And I told you to go to bed. We'll take about all this again tomorrow. What do we do with this money? We should donate it to the Emergency Services. But I don't know who to give it to. - Give it? - You don't want to keep it? Well, yes. It's not exactly stolen money. - You reckon? - It's stolen from thieves. I'm not stuffing my pockets with money from the black-market. Well, I think it should find its way back there. I want to feed and clothe my family. Not with 400,000F! It's not a question of numbers, you said so yourself. And I won't all this money from a kid like Antoine. - It's not on. - Antoine? You don't know him. He'd be over the moon. You're talking... Oh, let's go. I told them I saw you, but not with a woman. You're too kind. Who is she? You really should tell me. Someone I love very much, Pierrette. Kids. We're going down to the shelter. I don't mind, but why does it have to be today? - You're keeping it? - I'm looking after it. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's not warm in this shelter. Dear me, Antoine... a lot has happened, in a single day. And an air raid to top it off. A false alarm, perhaps? There's nowhere so private to talk as in the middle of a crowd... who are a little afraid. I'm not scared. Me neither, believe it. I just wanted to talk about what's just happened... with your friend Tiercelin... You can go there if you want. - I haven't robbed him. - That's not what I mean. I was pretty angry, Antoine. It's true you didn't rob him, I see you understand. But I'm thinking of something else. The young woman who intervened at the last moment... Olga? - You know her? - Yes. Really? I don't know what you made of it. - I didn't make anything of it. - Sure you did. You must have been a bit surprised at the way she... Antoine, there's something I must tell you... No need. I want everything to be above-board between us. Right. I'd already met her that afternoon. And I think her feelings for me seemed... a little too tender. She showed them in all innocence. But if she knew who you were... She knew very well. But how? Dad... I hope you'll forgive me, but I want to tell you something. You're wrong about the role Olga played this evening. She cosied up to you in front of everyone... because M. Tiercelin went and got her to do just that. What are you saying? M. Tiercelin? - Antoine... - I know because he told me. Just like he threw her in your lap that afternoon. He even boasted about it. I don't see why he'd do that. Yes, dad. Now you can see very well. So that afterwards you wouldn't be able to say anything... to anyone. You reckon? Yes, clearly... you're right. I've nothing more to say. No, go on. Soon it won't embarrass you. Are you listening? Yes, yes. Excuse me, Antoine. I'm not thinking about you just now. It's me. Yes, I just got old overnight. Oh, it's not the Olga business. I should have met her when I was 20. I should have met her... I did meet her. No, it's because you have become a man... and I didn't even notice. Me neither, you know. I didn't notice myself. So maybe there's still a little way to go? Don't push yourself. Take your time. It's hit our neighbourhood this time. It's hit 52. We must clear up. Let's have some volunteers. Subtitles: FR Eclair Group; EN autolycus.
