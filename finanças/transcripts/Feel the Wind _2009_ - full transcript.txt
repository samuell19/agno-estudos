Everybody, how about going to Hakone ! You're joking ? Hakone Relay Marathon ? The top school track teams train hard daily for years Even so, only a few universities can participate And this little phantom Track Team First of all, where is the supervisor or coach ? Landlord Come up here He's coming Coach, all members are here Good evening, sir Good evening You guys are aiming for the Hakone Relay Marathon ? There's something I'd like to say Never give up Adrink ? With water That's it The landlord used to be on the Track Team as a student I was involved back in the days of the Legend The Legend ? 60's hero, Ultraman No, the runner Haiji, are you serious ? Of course At least as Track Team members we live at Bamboo Hut It's time to proclaim it out loud What ? If I'd known this is the Club dorm... Everyone here is gifted, especially you We're used to running Marathon requires everyday training more than ability Only 5 km Right, it's impossible Wrong, why do you think I prepare our meals alone every day ? For physical conditioning And Nico has track experience twins played soccer in high school Yuki did kendo fencing Trust my judgment Prodigy walked to school 10 km daily on mountain roads and Musa has great potential It's a stereotype that Blacks run fast I'm just on an overseas scholarship Excellent Japanese ! He's not just foreign back up Thank you I've observed your character and running you have good potential Prince, you do too Huh ? I'm no sports nut It's impossible ! Amateurs You're not amateur ? You are a good runner, but anyone can run You know about running ? I'd like to know about running, Kakeru so tell me about it Whatever you do, don't wreck Bamboo Hut That's all Yes Morning Where's the Coach ? Sleeping, but here's another great coach, Nira Nira, you there ? Wow, that's nice Show me Like a real runner Let's run to the riverbed That's 5 km from here That will be 10 km return Run at your own pace, don't push yourself At my own pace, right ?

Nira, come Yuki is also fast Not exhausted at this pace ? Maybe we can Maybe we really can do it Okay Prince... It's impossible You hear me ? I heard My room really creaks Everywhere does Your floor is worst, it'll collapse So what should 1 do ? Move out ? With all this stuff ? You and Haiji want me out of here ? You dislike running ? Dislike ? It's just impossible, I can't do it Can't move out either If it's impossible, why did Haiji invite you here Who knows Anyone who's devoted this much effort has incredible tenacity That's a compliment ? He wants you to enjoy running like you enjoy comics 1 like Haiji and sympathize injury prevented him from running Is that so ? It seems better now, but he had given up limagine not being able to read comics So I can understand this reckless challenge of his Everyone at Bamboo Hut understands So we won't try to stop him All right, let's run After stretching limber up for an hour before starting intense training Limber up ? It means slow running, right ? Right, don't push your body too far Suddenly running and stopping leads to injuries We run before running ? Run before running ? Drink before drinking Confusing Okay, let's go Yes... All right, Okay Chin down, look straight ahead Prodigy, look ahead ! Ahead ! Swing your arms ! Yuki, arms ! Good, King.

Cross country On a trail instead of a track or road The soft dirt won't stress your legs Prodigy, don't give up SolguessC.C.25%8 A route of 2.5 km laps in a field, do six laps But isn't that 15 km in total ? It's not enough, but we're just getting started Kakeru does eight laps JOG must mean jogging ? Right, we'll vary routes so it doesn't become tedious Distance runners must use different muscles than sprinters Sprinters rely on muscular limits, which occur naturally but marathon runners benefit from daily training Marathoners can rely more on effort than natural ability 36, 37, 38, good effort Prodigy, good job ! Nice You Okay ? Nausea ? Hakone mountains are no mirage If you run, at some point you'll reach them Jyota... Haiji said girls like fast runners Believing that keeps me going Hey, it's her ! That girl's following ! Heard it from Kakeru she's dating Haiji What ? She's checking our jog ? Like Prince's Nira I'd make an effort too, with such a cute girlfriend Jyoji, stay away from his girl We never allow affairs with others " Goal : Hakone Relay Marathon ! " " Be a Kansei University Sponsor” I know This is a twin's pride I know, I know Atop athlete gives a great massage Don't keep him for yourself Kakeru, I'm next Okay What are you making ? For business ? Stupid ! To avoid cigarette cravings It's scary, like it's cursed ABancho ghost ? Almost right, but different Where did the name Prodigy come from ? Because he's tolerant, and a genius That's why Not like that. Thanks Musa, let's switch Don't forget me! Wait a hit I come from deep in the mountains There are only a few kids so you easily seem like a genius I'm just average in this city Prodigy ! Yesg'.y ) Didn't you say you raise goats there ? Mountain goats I knew it, the goat herd from the Alps ! Don't change the topic Okay, I'm done Clara can walk Nico, can I use your PC ? What for ? To buy a treadmill on the Net. Forget that ! Your floor will break ! What's this ? Cigarettes Rikiishi, the comic book boxer and legend like Nico Everybody's so earnest Because Haiji is earnest We can't go against him He cooks for us Keeps the toilet spotless On exam day, he woke me like a mother It's all thanks to Haiji You big baby I was able to take the bar exam because of his ongoing efforts thought he was just nice, but it was all a scam I don't think it was deceit, I'm glad to know his motive Even his mixed up motive But we owe everything to him Let's do everything to give him a good year He'll want all of us to have a good year Yeah That's true " Kansei University " Well ? Nice, aren't they ? Great... Look so fast Really fast We'll need an official time of less than 17 minutes 17 minutes ? It's a requirement for attending the preliminary The official times must be 5,000m in 17 minutes or 10,000m in 35 minutes 1 didn't know Maybe I forgot to tell you ? Within 17 minutes ? We can do that No problem, we run it in 16 minutes And Musa in 15 minutes Hakone is within reach It's not easy 17 minutes is the minimum for the preliminary The best universities do it in just over 14 minutes Really ? All 10 runners can do that ? In that case, only Kakeru and Haiji can make it But for now 17 minutes is enough Put your all into it tomorrow We'll show everyone who we are Kansei University Track Team Jyoji ! Run ! Jyota ! Good !

Right I heard Haiji Kiyose recovered Do you know Haiji ? He's not in top form Without injury, he would've run in Hakone every year Where is Kakeru ? You're late ! I'm starving ! What's wrong ? Let's go home Let's go ! Hungry ! Fujioka from Rikudo University spoke to me With him as their star they're aiming for a 4th consecutive win in Hakone We were senior high school classmates You and Fujioka ? He's surpassed me now Who's next ? Jyota Not bad, six Kakeru is training too hard Kakeru, let's start Drink this Shall I call the landlord ? He's the Coach Really our Coach ? Where was he on qualifying day ? He was in the game room playing Go Again ? Prince, how far did you run today ? You prefer comics to improving ? Kakeru, stop that You're weird lately, you look scary I can't understand how all of you can be so carefree You think you're great because you're faster Okay, okay, you're right Racing slowly means nothing Stop that, Kakeru ! You shouldn't say that We can't all have it as easy as you do You don't try hard Train hard to run faster What's with you Stop that Why pick on me ? Please... Find someone else Prince, there's no oneliving here to replace you You won't get through the preliminary if you don't try harder Finally you're serious about this Being serious is good but it's impossible for you now Impossible while I'm here Have a drink Just cool down You'll wreck the place If you're in such a rush for Hakone, take the train That's the problem ? Can't you see his effort ? You're the one that told him get to enjoy running like you enjoy comics But that's... Don't forget that Those words show the real you and will keep you running Speed is not enough, that's hollow Look at my leg you'll understand the result of pursuing speed I'm sorry Haiji Are you all right ? Your leg Hey Thank you Don't worry, lack of sleep led to anemia and exhaustion I've never seen that before He tried to do too much Runner, supervisor, coach, manager looking after the Bamboo Hut And he trained a lot Kakeru, you stay here and mend things with him Kakeru I just... I'm sorry What's the highest praise a distance runner can be given ? It's not being called fast ? I think it's... strong I believe in you I'm okay, go home and sleep King 1 forgot this here Prince and I really aren't runners Didn't intend to start this Somehow I don't belong ? That's not true It's always been that way, I'm not good with people But I hide it and act friendly, it's so tiring But I like the Bamboo Hut, everybody's nice Nico's quiz hat He made it for you ? He's in Engineering 1 don't want to move out I can do the Hakone event It's not just an event I heard it helps with job hunting That's probably true I think it's strong Almost done Don't give up 48, 49, 50, 51, 52...

It means running high in the mountains Mountain course is a hit over 3km, so 6 laps equals 20km Each Hakone stage is about 20km, Preliminary is also 20km We'll get used to that distance and running in reduced oxygen Real cross country training Right Real runs in hell will begin Whether it's hell depends on you It's more of the same Okay, let's go Yes...

Kakeru tell your parents about the relay marathon ? No Why not ? We don't get along since I caused trouble in senior high They send money, but I have really left home In the school that I went to my father was the coach He was the authoritarian type of coach you dislike I ran as my father said to I couldn't mention leg problems Because I was afraid he'd say You can't run any more No We didn't have a good coach to athlete relationship In the end I chose Kansei with its minor Track Team As my running ability lessened, I wanted to know What is running ? I wanted to show people Even in that minor club, and even amateurs I wanted to show that anyone can run if they have passion Then I met you Your running ability exactly matched my dream Not because you were fast But because you have a purity of spirit and you are keen about running I really enjoyed running with you for almost a year No matter what, I have no regrets I'm going for a jog Haiji ll understand Wait for me at Tsurumi 1 will pass the sash to you It's truly a wonderful morning, Kakeru 08:10 in the morning Our return begins with a general start Over 10 minute gaps led to delayed teams starting here But the real difference is 11 minutes, 53 seconds Total time was the same as the 18th rank From now the apparent rank and the actual rank will differ The downhill 6th stage was perfect for Yuki He methodically matched his running with the terrain And took advantage of the speed Such speed This is the scenery that Kakeru sees You dwell in a lonely place Isolated, but a beautiful place Kofu Gakuin U, Totai U Kansei U Yuki Yuki ! Win your stage ! You're fastest for this stage Come Good job It's yours now Yuki Regrettable ! Lost by only two seconds Regrettable ? What ? Huh ? Dochido U is still in the lead Rikudo U is one minute behind But Fujioka will run the 9th for Rikudo U's 4th straight victory Kakeru, do you love Hana ? Huh ? What's that mean ? You said, run for the sake of love It's about yourself ? Not about me So I can confess my love to Hana at the finish ? No way I knew I was right Shut up ! Embarrassing ! If you win your stage, I'll give her up Are you sure ? Remarkable run for Kansei Fujiokas You might do miracles and be among the top 10 No, we have to make up for the general start Nico !I love you ! Stay back... Be King Kansei U has hope, you and Kiyose Rikudo U might also do miracles and win the race 4 years in a row It's not miracles, we make it happen Because I'll smash the record for the 9th That's my Hakone Relay Marathon And then, I'll smash your new record You have three more years to do it No, you would be a new record holder For about 10 minutes Swing arms... You can do it If you're a man, do it Leaving the coast the course of the remaining 9 km gradually climbs Then the Yugyoji incline after running over 15 km Yugyoji is a head temple of the Jishu Buddhist sect The toughest part of the 8th stage has always tormented runners Engine sounds have changed runners are commencing the incline How's the race ? We are running 13th now, but our actual rank is 15th 5 ranks to be seeded for next year You're serious about being in the top 10 ? Of course, don't you know who'll run next ? Kansei U Do your best...

Earned my position to run Amazing for you freshman to be anchor I wanted to run the 2nd or 9th stages but our team has many runners faster than me But your team is running behind ours now Only because of the general start We lost a hit downhill, but our total time beats yours We'll soon pass to make top 10, and gain seed rights Are you serious ? Even if you got seed rights what would you do next year ? Your club will be short of runners ll have no idea We just do what we can do now for the goal I see, Kansei U is like a school kid's racing spirit Don't underestimate that pure racing spirit Look Kurahara is catching up with awesome speed from the start He passed the 5 km point in 13 minutes, 58 seconds Amazing speed ! Kakeru does mean run ! Kakeru Black sash swinging, Kansei U is passing two at once Kurahara never looks back I keep saying to slow down He can't keep that pace, what shall we do ?
