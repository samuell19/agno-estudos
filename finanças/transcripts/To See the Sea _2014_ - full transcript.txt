Tomas Hrobsky presents his very own film TO SEE THE SEA Starring Mom Dad Stana Grandma Zdena Football coach Safarik Haris's dad Haris's mom FC Jiskra Ceske Budejovice Mr. Taxi driver Hi, my name is Tomas Hrobsky. Yesterday, I turned eleven. My big dream is to become a famous director and direct movies. But not only here in the Czech Republic! I would like to start my career here. Shoot one or two movies and then work in America. In Hollywood. Just like Milos Forman. Dad keeps telling me I need to learn it first, but I decided to make a film anyway. I got a camera and my very own editing program. I can use it to cut scenes, add music, make all kinds of effects, and play with sound. A filmmaker should make a movie about something that he knows. So, I will shoot my first film about myself, my family, and Haris. Haris is my best friend from former Yugoslavia, now Croatia. His mom is from there. Haris was born in Croatia, but then his whole family moved here, because his dad is Czech. Haris Kubalek! Hi. He is my classmate. And even though he's a Croat, his Czech is excellent. I have never seen the sea, my parents never have time nor money for a beach holiday. But Haris promised we'd go see it one day. This is my dad, my mom. She wants to be pregnant, but she isn't. This is our house. We live in a beautiful, historical city. We live in Ceske Budejovice. This is Stana, a girl I love. I think she likes me, as well. But she is still too young and too shy to express it. Mom said girls do this all the time. And the best way to make them like you is to show you're interested, and then stop it. Tomas, don't do it! And even if they were not interested at first, they'd start missing your attention and want it back. Stana loves ice creams and has a beautiful voice. My grandpa died some time back, but I still have a grandma Zdena. She is at our place quite often, my dad always drives her. But she should walk and get here on her own. Tomas! - Hi, grandma! - Tomas! You haven't exercised, again! You never walk, anymore! Then come with me to see the swans. She listens to folk music, and hardly ever goes on walks. But she's more easy-going than mom. Mom's pretty strict. Tomas, don't film me now. Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! She's fun to be around. She says she loves me and folk music more than anything in the world. I love her more than anything in the world, too. But she constantly eats things that are bad for her! So I take those bad things away from her to keep her healthy. Tomas, give that back. Give it back! Hana, make him give that back! I also don't like that she farts and never admits to it. Grandma? You just farted! I didn't do such thing! Every movie should start with something tragic. The tragedy of my life is football! Haris and I play for a club. He's really good. But I couldn't care less about it. Still you are way better than some guys the coach puts in. I hate football, but I have to play it! Dad said I'm good at it, but I know he says that only to keep me doing it and away from drugs. This is Coach Safarik. What are you doing? Oh, come on! Move it! The coach best friends are the Daddies. That's how Tomas and I call them. They are the fathers of some of our teammates. The Daddies are best buddies with the coach, and their kids are best buddies with the coach's son. And these guys get to play the most. I think they're idiots. Hey, stop messing around over there! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Milan, look at that! He's playing around with that camera! That's Hrobsky again, huh? Come on! Move it, move it, move it! Or I'll make you do squats! Damn, Klimes! You aren't showering, again?! But I didn't even break a sweat! - Move it or I'll slap you! - Leave me alone! Get into that shower, or you're gonna stink! - But I'm not sweaty! - Damn, Klimes! No! Leave me alone! His dick looks like a little mushroom! He's circumcised! - Cool, let me see! - Damn, man, circumcision! Leave me alone! So, this is how it looks like at football practice! Luckily, they don't bother Tomas or me. They only call us faggots, because we never want to talk to them. And we don't care. We have one mystery we need to solve. My dad keeps going away someplace during the day. He lies about it, and never wants to say where he goes. My dad finally found a job. He sells used furniture, and can work from home, because he sells the furniture online. Mom is a physiotherapist, and helps people who suffered injuries, need their joints loosened, or she tries teaching paralyzed people to walk again. But that is rarely a success. I know she does a lot of good, but I don't like going there. That place is full of sick, injured people, and mom mostly helps the disabled. But mom is right. It's good for a person to see all this in order to appreciate what he's got. But they never let me inside that building. I don't know. I have proof my dad is a liar thanks to my new camera. So, enjoy your meal. - Bon appétit. - Bon appétit. - How was football training? - OK. Alright, let's play! Move it, move it, move it! Hrobsky, Kubalek, 50 squats for chatting! Where are you going, Hrobsky? You think you'll squat better over there, huh? Damn it! One! Two, come on! Three! Four! Five, move it! Will you be playing on Saturday? I would like to stop by and watch you play. - Mommy will join me, right? - Hm. I don't know if I'll be playing. Maybe some of the guys won't show up, and I'll get a chance. Why doesn't he ever put you in? Because you never stop by. Sorry, but football is not about parents stopping by. Hm. - And do you train hard enough? - Yeah. - And does the coach ever praise you? - No. And what about Haris? He plays quite often. - Quite often? - Hm. Haris is the best player on that team. Yeah. He is. Mommy and I will come on Saturday, right? Hm. So, here we go. - Dad? - Hm? Were you at home today? When? When I was at school. Of course I was at home. Why? And what were you doing? I was working on the computer, that's what. Why? Even at 10:00? Yeah, even at 10:00. I was doing some work stuff. Why? So, dad is lying to me! Will I finally find out why? I didn't want to jump to any conclusions, so I continued filming my dad for the next couple of days. On Monday, he was at home and truly worked on his computer. But on Tuesday, he went somewhere, again. On Thursday, I wanted absolute certainty he's not in a different part of the flat, so I placed my camera into the window. And dad really sped off somewhere in his company car. Dad? What? Were you at home today, too? I worked on the computer all day. Why are you interested in this so much, Tomas? If you only knew, mom! I seriously suspect my dad is cheating on mom. That he's seeing another lady. I know it happens in movies all the time. But I don't want it happening to my parents. Well, it usually starts with the people not getting along too well. They fight a lot, and then find other partners they get along with better. Haris and I have decided to uncover this secret. And we're gonna film it all! Grandma, don't you think something weird has been going on around here lately? Yeah. You keep stealing my sweets, and you don't want to go see the swans with me. Come on, grandma. This is important! You keep nagging me about moving more! Well, let's go see the swans like we used to. Yeah, I'll go. But I really need to ask you something. Don't you think something's been going on around here lately? - Between mom and dad? - What do you mean? - Do they fight a lot? - No, they don't. Well, if they don't fight... Well, yeah. But maybe they aren't sleeping together. What do you mean? I don't mean like next to each other, but that they aren't ...you know... I know what kind of sleeping you mean. But why is that important? - Well, do they sleep together or not? - They do. Sleep as in sleep together? Yeah. How do you know? I just know. Really? I don't know. It was weird. I hope they stop doing it once the baby is born. They want another kid? Why else would they be sleeping together? Well, if they're sleeping together, your dad might not be cheating on her. Maybe he's just going somewhere. He might not be necessarily having an affair. Hm, I hope so, I have to find out. A cathedral's shadow, half the sky with God knows what, yeah, yeah. One's ideal, a dream I like to dream. A scarf from smiles, a house or a poem's rhymes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me what other gifts I could give you. Wish for what you want, a gold mine or golden tower, sweet salt, sad Eden, dry rain. Go ahead and take, a sea plain or beach, spherical music, just take it all together with me, yeah, yeah! My ideal, you know what I like, yeah, yeah! A cathedral's shadow, a dream I like to dream in the mornings. Well, I think it's a little weird. Showing interest at first and then doing the opposite. It sounds like a stupid game. Well, it kind of is a game. Mom said it's like a game of posturing. That's how girls do it. Let the girls do what they want. We are guys and do things our way. If you keep playing games, you will never get to actually doing it. You know, like your parents. Wait a minute, where did you... You asshole! You watched it! - You left it turned on! - You're such a perv! I had no idea that position even existed. I'll just set up the camera. It's a little survey, you know. We want to collect answers from everyone. We are asking everybody. So, question number one. What's your favorite subject? The Czech language. Who do you hate the most in class? Alice and Jana. Who's your best friend? Lucka. And which one of the boys in class do you like? No. What? I don't want to say. But why not? No. Why not? - Bye. - Bye. So! Honestly, it simply switched off! I don't know why! Bullshit. No, I swear! And she didn't want to say it afterwards, either. She was too shy. Then you should have asked her after the camera switched off. - But I did ask. - And? - She wouldn't say. - But there must be somebody... Damn it, what are you two ladies doing over here? Lock up and then leave the keys at reception, understood? Yeah, sure. It's after practice. Thomas is in the shower and refuses to let me pass by him to the toilet. Every time I try, he douses me with water. And there is no other way to the bathroom than past the showers. Come on, come on! I'm gonna pee myself! Come on, you little pussy! But I'll put on his clothes, and we'll see if he hoses me down. Ha! Shit! Those are my clothes! You dumb-ass! In what am I gonna go home now? Ah, our little Spielberg! Not Spielberg. Forman, mom! Forman. Stop filming me, Forman. I don't look my best. You're beautiful, anyway. Even looking like this, I would let you star in my film. You're so sweet. - Mom? Does dad think you're pretty? Uh, I think he does. Well, I hope he does, of course. What did you buy? I don't know. Some meds for blood vessels or something. Who is it for? For grandma, of course. I used to pick up meds with the number 250 on them. Now it's 500. I'm sure she is getting worse. Come on! So, what do you think I should do with Stana? Nothing, I guess. She might not be interested in anybody at all. Everybody likes somebody. I'm telling you, she's playing that girls' game. I'll take her out someplace. Hm. Don't "hm" me. First, you tell me to take her out, and that the game is only for girls, and now you "hm" at me... Hm. Hm. Jesus Christ. OK, maybe I was wrong the last time we talked about this. I guess it's not that easy to hook up with a girl. And maybe we've still got enough time for this sort of stuff. My grandpa always used to say: "He that fears every bush... must never go a birding." No. "He that fears every bush... is a pussy." Training for our trip to the sea. Croatia, my homeland! Come on, get in. - Hi, Haris. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Idiots. So, this is FC Jiskra Ceske Budejovice. What's up, guys?! These two are Masak and Krejca. The biggest bullies and also biggest friends of the coach's son. Hey, why don't you film something yourself? But I film stuff all the time. I mean film some stuff at your place. Dad doesn't like people coming over. I don't have to go. But you could borrow my camera, right? Nah, there's nothing to film there, anyway. Leave me alone! - Come on, you squeal like a girl. - Leave me alone. Stop it! Open your mouth! Come on, open up! Leave him alone, you idiots! - Here's another one! - What's going on there? Break it up! Hrobsky, Kubalek, stop it! Stop it immediately, damn it! Did you hear me? What a relief, huh? Come on, come on! Philip! Philip! Are you OK? Sure. I don't care. I didn't want to play, anyway. I did. I know. So, ready? Always! And how exactly are you sick? My stomach hurts. How does it hurt? I feel like throwing up. OK, fine. Stay home today. I'll bring you some medicine. I found out my dad leaves the house every Tuesday and Thursday. He lies about it, and refuses to say where he goes. Today is Tuesday. I have decided to stay here and... Here, take one. It will make you feel better. Wash it down. There you go. Try to get some sleep, OK? Today is Tuesday, and I have decided to stay here, and observe how he will act, when he won't be able to leave because of me. Suddenly, it grew eerily silent. I was afraid my dad managed to sneak out. Therefore, I set out to explore the flat. This is our apartment. So, my dad was in his study. - What's going on? - Nothing. Why are you standing here? - I'm going to the toilet. - Why don't you go, then? So? Did you poop? Nothing's coming out. - And your stomach still hurts? - Yeah. Then go lie down, Tomas. Now I have to go myself. And I told myself, it's now or never! Hi, honey. I'm not coming today, I can't. Thomas stayed home today, he is not feeling well. I don't want him asking any questions. I'll stop by if he falls asleep, OK? Bye, love you, bye. So, it's official. My dad is seeing another woman, my dad is a liar. It's only a matter of time before my parents get divorced. And mom doesn't suspect a thing. "Does dad think you're pretty?" Uh, I think he does. And grandma doesn't have a clue, as well. Well, if they don't fight... So, it is all up to me. I have decided to be tough and follow this through. And follow all my dreams. - So, bon appétit. - Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. So, will I get to see the sea this year? Come on, Tomas, we've already told you we can't go this year. And why not? Well, daddy has a lot of work. We can go without him, can't we? Look, we managed to save enough money for a camera this year. Next year, we'll try to save enough for a vacation, OK? Tomas, we'll go to the seaside as soon as possible. We promised you that. But it's just not possible this year, OK? - And eat your food. - Eat up. And when will we have the baby? What baby? Well, my sibling. I would like one. So when? Tomas, we don't want another child. We have you and that's more than enough. Yeah. I've had enough. Well, if they're having problems, wouldn't a divorce be the best solution? That's always better than to have a screwed up family. But our family doesn't seem screwed up at all. Hey, when will you start filming at your place? I won't be filming there. But there HAS to be more of you in a movie about me. Hm. Fine, then I'll put in how you're pooping! What do you mean? How you're pooping. Ouch! Au! Watch out, dummy, the camera! I'll film you taking a leak! Hey, you know what I did? - Yeah, you filmed me pooping! - Yeah, that too. But you know what else? I asked Stana out on a date! Hm. What? I don't know if that's a good idea. Wait, what do you mean you "don't know"? Why? I don't know. Jesus! You don't know this, you don't know that. "Don't knows" everywhere. You don't want to film at home, you don't know if asking Stana out is a good idea. "Don't knows" everywhere. You're dumb as a goalpost. Wait a minute... You're in love with her! No, I'm not. Come closer! Come closer. You're in love with her, aren't you? I'm not in love with Stana. Swear on camera. I swear ON camera: I'm not in love with Stana. Fine, OK. Then you will be filming my date with her. Touchy-feely romance... the key to a great movie! Reservation Haris Kubalek. Reservation Tomas Hrobsky. Can you please give me one Tubino and two scoops of vanilla ice cream? - Yeah, vanilla. - Vanilla. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Fifty. Hello, two tickets, please. I got this. After you. Come on, let's take a seat somewhere. OK. On a bench. Hm. What about that one? Alright. Come on. - Here? - Yeah. But my dad is supposed to pick me up in half an hour. OK, so let's stay here for half an hour, then. Alright, fine. But, Thomas, I really don't want to start dating you. I just don't. Oh. I thought that since we talk to each other in school and... Yeah, we do, but I like... somebody else. Who? Somebody else. Who? Somebody else. Just tell me who. I like... Haris. Haris? But why Haris? And why didn't you tell him that in class when he was asking you questions for the documentary? But I did tell him. What? I told him. You bastard! Haris, is that you? Yeah, yeah, it's me. Dad's not home. Oh, yeah? Why are you so late, Haris? I'm sorry, I was out with Thomas. At this hour? And what about school, Haris? Everything's fine. Haris, hit the lights! Oh, sorry. I'll just change into pyjamas. You bitch! Fuck this! Haris, go in there! Go! What were you doing there? Stop screaming, you cunt! - What were you doing there? - Dad, leave her alone! - Let go of me! - Go to bed, go to bed! I'm telling you, go to bed! Come here! - Dad, stop! - I'm telling you, go to bed! Get out! And this happens often? Yeah, almost all the time. And does he hit you, too? No, almost never. Sometimes I get hit when I try protecting mom. When I grow up, I'll make him pay for this. Or you could shoot a real movie about it. About the stuff you've been through. Everybody does that. I mean, every director. Yeah, I could do that. And... that thing with Stana. I wasn't sure if I should tell you, because... Don't worry about it. We won't let a girl get in between us, right? Absolutely. So, Stana. This is your end in our film! Sorry. But you should've told me. Hi. Hello, everyone. - Tomas, come over here! - Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Zdena. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, grandma. Tomas, don't take it away from me today! I won't. Not today. Don't worry! Come on, everybody. Come on, Tomas! Could you play the song we talked about? - Mom! Mom! - What? - Come on. - Oh, no, Hana! - Nonsense, come here! - We're all ready! Then who? Who'll dance with grandma? I can't. I'm filming. Stop making excuses, Tomas, and get over here! - Come on, I'll film it for you. - No, I... Go on! Dance! - Shut up, you bitch! - I've had it with you! - Haris, go in there! - Stop, I'm begging you! Where is the money? Where is it? Give me the money? Where are you hiding the cash, huh? You bitch! Haris, go in there! Where's the money, you bitch! But that's money for the kids, Radim! Get in there! Get in there! You bitch! I've had it with you! You slut! Bitch! Ouch! Ouch! Come here! Get in there! Get in! - Please, stop! No, please! Please! - Get in there! - Please. - Shut up! I've had it with you! Damned bitch! Haris! Haris! Haris! Mom! Haris, he locked me in here and ran away. No, Haris, no! Haris! Haris! Dad, give me the keys! Let her out! What the hell do you have there? Come here! Give me that camera, you bastard! You little fuck! Give me that camera! You bastard, come here! Haris? Where's that bastard? Where's that... - Let me go! - What was it you were holding? - Nothing! - You had a camera! - No, I didn't! - Give me that camera! I'll teach you a lesson! - Where's that camera? - I don't have it! You piece of shit, where is it? What is that? A camera. I borrowed it from Thomas. Haris, hide it! If he finds it, then... He won't, don't worry! I'm sorry he hit you, too. You're the one getting hit the most, mom! This can't go on like this. It's getting worse and worse. But what am I supposed to do? Here! It's complicated. We have to do something. I would like to go back home to Croatia. I filmed it yesterday. Everything. Holy shit. We're skipping school for the very first time, because we've decided to find out where my dad drives off to. There's no turning back. Did you order a cab? Yes, my friend Kubalek did. OK, gentlemen, do you have cash? Stealing is wrong, but desperate times... This is my parents' secrete money stash. We do. Alright, jump in. Where to? Just a moment, please. We're still waiting on someone. OK. Follow that car, please. Wait, are you serious? Well, yeah. Cool! It was a strange car ride. When I was younger, I always wanted what I wished for. And I've never experienced wanting something unpleasant for myself. But I simply wanted to know the truth. Who's the man in the car? - My dad. - Oh, yeah? And where are we headed? The thing is... we don't know. Please, keep your distance. So he doesn't notice us. Of course, of course. I had to summarize everything for myself. My dad regularly disappears somewhere and lies about it. I worked on the computer all day. And mom and grandma don't suspect a thing. It seemed obvious. Wait... where's he driving? - Thank you. - On the house, gentlemen. - Thank you. - Go on. Hi, honey. He drives here to see your mom? But why in secret? Here it is. Tomas, what's wrong? And how did you get that bruise, Haris? I hit my head a little. How exactly? Playing football. Jesus Christ. You are little dumbbells, aren't you? Travelling this far and this late. - Does your mom know about this? - No. And yours, Haris? Well, mine doesn't either. Well, well! What's wrong? You're limping! Nah, I just bumped my toe a bit! Let me see. Why don't you put something on it? It's fine. A scab has formed over it. I'll go get you something for it. Thank you, thanks. - You're welcome. - Good boy. So, how are things, boys? How is school? - Fine. - Fine. And what about girls? Do you have one, Haris? No. Well, you've got enough time for that. And you, Tomas? Actually, I wanted one, but she liked Haris more. - So we both decided to dump her. - Really? That's nice. Girls would never do that. I would never want a girl for a grandkid, they're annoying. I'm happy I have you. Grandma, we came here because we are making a movie about our family. Well, I can see that. We have to ask you something. But eat a little, too! Well, go ahead. Grandma, I had this suspicion that dad is seeing another lady. And? Is he? No, he's not. But I found out he drives somewhere every Tuesday and Thursday. Every time I'm at school. So I followed him, and it turns out he drives to see mom at work. But when I asked about it, he lied and said he never left the house. I don't know what to think. Do you have any idea why dad doesn't want to tell me he's visiting mom at work? Tomas, I don't know what to say. You know what? You're such a clever boy. Don't give up, you'll find out. I'll take care of this. So, does she know or not? I dunno. It leaves the square every 20 minutes and will take you all the way home, OK? OK. Bye. Bye, Tomas. And be careful, alright? Don't talk to anyone. OK, bye. Bye, Haris. Goodbye. I'll flat out ask them about it tonight. I mean, they keep lying to me, dad's forcing me to play football, the beach holiday isn't happening again... Mom wants to go to Croatia. Really? So you're gonna see the sea, huh? Maybe I could join you, then! Right? What's wrong? Hey, could you lend me your camera? I would like to use both of them tonight. Sure. - So, bon appétit. - Bon appétit. Bon appétit. How was football training? Any better? - A little. - Yeah? More playing time, then? No changes there. Tomas, eat your food. I wanted to tell you two things. And I want you to take me seriously. I know I'm only 11, but I'm not totally small, either. Dad... Firstly, I don't want to play football anymore. I'll just stop playing. I'm not good at it and don't even enjoy it. I want to be a filmmaker and make movies. - Tomas, hold on... - Punish me all you want, I won't play anymore. I just won't! And the second thing is... and the second thing is... Yes? What? But when? What happened? What happened? How're you feeling? I dunno. What do you mean? Well, it's your last game. Hm. Actually, I'm just worried about leaving you here all alone with these idiots. Hm. Really, nothing? Well, not absolutely nothing. I've spent some time here. Today is the 27th of June. We are playing our last home game before the school break. I'm standing in front of the stadium and looking forward to something here for the very first time. This is the last football game of my life. Kind of fitting. - Maybe it was meant to be this way. - No. - You should be playing. - You should be playing. Substitution! Kubalek! Move it! You'll play in midfield. Come on, damn it! Honza, get off the pitch. Start playing. Come on, guys! Great! The first student to pick up his report card will be David Strangmiller. Congratulations, David, splendid grades. Thank you. Stana lndrakova. Miroslav Mraz. And our two filmmakers. Haris Kubalek. Nice report card. And Tomas Hrobsky. Come on, Tomas. Excellent grades. Congratulations. I wish you all great holidays, and I look forward to seeing you again. Goodbye. Ready? Let's go. Come on. Over there. What now? - Let's go! We have to! Dad? Dad! Dad! - What the...? - I know you drive here. I know you drive here every Tuesday and Thursday, and that you're lying to me. And I don't understand why when you're only seeing mom. Why is that something I shouldn't know about? So, I want you to tell me, why are you both lying to me?! Tomas? Tomas... OK, come with us. - But turn off the camera. - No, mom. The camera is coming with us and so is Haris. No. Mom, I've been after this for ages and I would have never found out you're both lying to me without a camera. So the camera is coming with us and so is Haris. Fine, then. Come on. Come on, come on. Hello. Wait here. Come in. Tomas, this is Ondra. Your step-brother. He was born 5 years before... before we adopted you. You were still a baby. Ondra lives in this facility, and daddy and I try to spend as much time with him as possible. We wanted to tell you about it soon, but you found out on your own. So... this is actually the end. This wasn't exactly what I wanted the film to be about. I planned on filming interesting things, and I ended up... On top of that, I'm back to having only one camera again. Are you going in? Yeah, thank you. What do you want? Hello, I'm Haris's friend. - Oh. - Is he here? - He's not! - Where is he? - I don't have a clue! Do you? If I did, why would I be looking for him? That bitch! But I know where he is now. My friend Haris... is living by the sea now. Hi, Tomas. I really wanted to tell you this, but recently I just couldn't find the, the right time. My mom, Pavlik, and I have decided to go back to my grandparents in Croatia. Dad doesn't know about it yet, and I expect him to cause trouble, because he will report this as a kidnapping. But I have about an hour of footage of him beating up mom. So he's screwed. But I hope to see you soon. You can come here for the summer. You're always welcome here. You should know that. And that I filmed you pooping as well. Take care, buddy. Don't worry, I won't forget my Czech. Learn some Croatian and learn to swim. And I hope all will be OK at home. Sometimes, your family would love to go to the seaside with you, but, for various reasons, they simply can't. But I don't mind. I'm gonna see the sea anyway. With someone or alone. Because... I followed my goal and achieved it. I found out my parents aren't cheating on each other, but love each other instead. And that they love me even though they are not my real parents. And that even parents get frightened sometimes and are unable to do certain things. I found out all of this and understood it on my own. I also managed to understand that, all of a sudden, I have a brother. And I stopped playing football, because I simply wanted to. And most importantly... I made a film, and now I can do anything.
