- Everything will be just fine. - Thanks babe. - You welcome. But we do need to get ready for your mother's 50th birthday party. Our plane leaves soon. - About that... you sure you ready to meet my family? - Yeah, I mean, how bad could it be? All right. - Baby! Yo man is hungry! I'ma go over there to Joe's Rib Shack and spend yo birthday with them. - Just go on down to the Rib Shack. And you goin' miss out on greens, yams, and my famous macaroni and cheese and trust me, it will be worth the wait. - I'm sure it will be, but let me ask you... is that cornmeal on yo fingers? No, just let me get the cornmeal off your fingers. - Cut it out, you play too much, stop, oohhh ooohh. - Let me lick the cornmeal off ya fingers. You play too much! Hello. Oh, hi baby! How you doing? Oh, you're almost here? Good! Okay, so what time does your plane land? - Who dat!? - Shhhhh! Of course the invitation still stands, honey we'd be happy to have you over for dinner Lisa. - Invitation? There's no invitation. - Yes. Six o'clock... I'll see you then. All right. Merry Christmas, baby. - Um. Um hmm... - What? - Flo, you know better. Stop playin' matchmaker. - I'm not! - Um hm. - Well, maybe just a little. - Mom Johnson. Jonas Johnson. - That boy can make his own decisions about love. You know, I did and look what it got me. Fine fox like you and I didn't need no help. Yeah, smooth as silk, I was, 'member? - Um hm. - Pretty Ricky's what they call me. - Thank you, sweetie, but Jonas is my baby and I know what's best for him even when he doesn't. Besides it's my birthday and I can do what I wanna do! - You sure can, baby. - Hey. - Hey. - Hello. I can't believe you finally goin' bring yo , hold on. So, you just goin' open the garage, so Pookie and 'nem can see me gettin' a weave? - Girl, it's hot in here. - I can't with the garage! - It's hot in here! If you don't like it, you can go to another salon. - Now, you know I ain't goin find nobody else to do my hair for $15 a track. - Right, you get what you pay for. - Hey girl, I'm back, more hood chronicles. So, I was shocked to see that you're going to the little party! - I was shocked when I received an invite. Why? You know the Johnson's have always treated you like family. - I mean, we're pretty close and Mrs. Johnson only turns 50 once. - Yeah, you know Jonas is goin' be there. - Have you forgotten? It's football season, so he won't be there. - Apparently, you don't watch the news. Jonas was injured and he hasn't played in months. Rumor is he will never play again, girl you know them football players get cut left and right. - Wow, I have to admit I'm not much of a sports fan, but I'm sure he'll be here with his teammates and besides his mom knows better than to put us in the same room together. - Why the hell would she have a birthday party and not invite her son? - I don't know! Less drama maybe. - Yeah. - You know it's been a long time since the family's come together. - That girl's not family, Flo. She's an X-Factor, that's what she is. - She's a long time family friend and that's close enough. - You heard me, let the chocolate love connection take care of that. - Look, I just think they let some things get in the way. They still didn't help gettin' back together. - I hear he's quite the celebrity athlete, my mom said he, shuts the whole city down when he visits. Yeah and every time I see him he has a different girl on his arm. - Um, he has changed. - That he has, but he's just going through all those counterfeits, so that he can find his way back to you. - It'll be just fine. You know how I know? - How do you know? - Because whatever God's will is - Um. - be! - Um! - And if it's not meant to be, no worries. - Hmm, now, did you say God's will? - Um hm. - Well, if that be the case, why are you dippin' Flo? God don't need yo help! You wrong, Flo. - Oh baby, I just like seein' people happy like you and I, that's all. - Um hmm, well, if they have a chance for a fraction of what you and I have, then I guess it's nothing wrong with that. You think maybe later we can do that thing that we said we'd do once a year? You know, 'round... - On your birthday! Today is my birthday, Johnny. - Oh yeah. - It's me again, James Brown, work for the people and I feel good! - Come on in. - Thank you Mr. Johnson, how are you today, sir? - I was doing good, I was. Come on in. - I doubt that, I mean, he finally has what he's always wanted and that's fame and fortune. Something, I never really too much cared for. Well, except for the fortune part! - Girl, you better do like everybody else and open you up a little boutique. Have him pay for it, he good for it. You better get him before he spend the rest of that money on them white girls. Stop! Being rough, girl let me call you back, I'll see you in a minute. Why you gotta be so rough!? Crazy, old Danny. - And y'all ain't got nothin' else to do? You ain't got nobody to kill? Nobody to rough up? You just goin' stare at me? Oh, y'all just still goin' look? Y'all ain’t never seen nobody get weave? I know I've been sayin' this my hair for years, but it is, but it ain't. - It's a lot to look at, like all head. - What you talkin' about? - And tell your little girlfriend that this is my real hair, 'cause I know she be asking. Stop, bein' so rough! That's why you get fired from every salon. I'm the last customer you got! - You can get out my garage if you don't like it. - And then how you goin` pay your rent? - I like the hood. You know those white people don't need me in the suburbs. - Sir, I understand it can be hard to let go and move on, but it'll be better, don't you think? - Listen, James, - James. - that's the problem with some people, they get a little money and they forget about the community that they came from. I'm not selling! - Whoo! - Oh man! Um! Tastes like victory. So, you thought more about what I said? About being down with the set? - I don't know man, it just seems kind of... - Yo! Forget about tryin' to get that basketball scholarship! What! Why are you wasting your time on an empty dream anyways? You never goin' be like your brother. So stop livin' in the shadows. - Why are you bringing up Jonas? For real, you know I hate that man. I get it, I'm not like him, I don't need you reminding me. Just drop it man. - All right, man. - Ugh man... It's Jonas, man. Hold on. - Aight man. - Yo, what's up? - Big dog! Hey little bro. Just called to check on you, how you doin'? - I'm busy man, what do you want? Oh you busy?

I use the good towels. - Hmm, from the looks of the strains on your shirt, I could've swore you was using your shirt! Last week, I wiped with that skunk you got on your head, you call it a weave. - You look real familiar. - Yeah, I played basketball at Middleton, maybe you seen a game or two. Nah, nah... you Jonas Johnson's little brother. - Yeah, that's my brother. What that got to do wit' anything? This dude here. What's that got to do wit anything? Man, your brother's the top player in the NFL, making mad paper! Why in the hell would you be in here wit' a room full of killers? Must be crazy.. - Well, that's just it. That's his paper. Ready to make my own and make a little name for myself. - Okay, hmm, I can dig it. This little dude got heart. - Told you, man. - We'll see. I tell you what? Meet me in the park tonight at 10 and we'll see just how much heart you got? Now get up outta here! These clowns here, man! - Boss? - Pour me a drink, man. - You got it, boss. - Is this the reason why you don't come around anymore? - Nah, ma, you know I'm used to it. I do worry about Jasmine, she hasn't been around this type family before. you think about her man, she's fine, right? - Who her? Well, I mean, if you like skin and bones, I mean, she just looks like the type of girl if you rubbed up against her, she'd start a fire. a little twig! She remind me of one of them monster high. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I felt sorry for her. I wanted to hug her again. "Listen here baby, you can eat, here's a chicken wing." Here is a chicken wing. - I agree with all of that, just don't you hug her. You'll suffocate the poor thing. - Get out of here. - Son, I'm the type of brother, like a little meat on this bones. You see, I'm from the dirty south. - Wit' a funky mouth. - Shave your armpits! Listen son! - I'm listenin pops. - A brother like me, likes a woman that I can cuddle up to her in the winter time and keep warm. Big booty! - Come on. - You understand what I'm sayin'? Like your mother. - Pause pops, that's too much information, okay? - Yes, well, it's how you got here. - Okay, pops. - Son, there's so much more to a woman than just how she looks. - Now, I know pops, so besides that, you know, she is a good woman, comes from a good family, she supports me and more importantly pops, it's no drama. - No drama? - No drama, no backtalk, no lip. - No lip!? Wait, wait. No lip? Son, I don't even know what that feels like. I don't know what it feels like, I don't know what it sounds like. - Quiet. - Quiet. Man, yo mama sleeps wit' her fists balled up at night in case I start something. - And that's what I'm talkin about pops, exactly. Jasmine and I, we don't fight, we don't argue. There's no drama, she... - What you say? - She's perfect. There no perfect women's son. - Maybe, but she's close. - Well, yeah, that's what you said about the last one wasn't it? Yeah, and the one before that. - Yes! - The woman before that, - Right! - Wasn't it? What happened to that white girl you brought here a couple of summers ago? - Can you stop with the white girl talk, it's Amy, her name is Amy. - Amy!? Boy, I don't care what her name is! She can't use our comb, why'd you bring her home? - But do y'all remember that Asian girl? Yeah, yeah, yeah! - That poor thing honey, she thought the chitlins was pasta. - Yes she did! Yes she did. - That was crazy, you know she broke up wit' me? Thought we was tryin' to kill her, thought we was tryin' to poison her. Tryin' to feed her feces or whatever. - Well, at least I can say this is the closest one to black that you brought since this. - Now, I agree with that. - Okay, that's enough everybody, all right? - It's okay ma, 'cause you know what, I had to go through my share of women to get to the right one and I feel that Jasmine's the right one. - Boy, if you don't get your head out of the crack of your ass! - Barbara! - What!? - Now son, I'm sure Jasmine is a nice girl, but to bring her here to meet your family after you engage, don't sound like she's the one. - Honey, everything that looks good ain't good for you. - Ain't that the truth. - Um! Oh yes sir, I'm telling you. - She's all right. We good. - Baby, it's so good to see you. Look at you!

Stop it, you're gonna get us in trouble. - Lisa? What are you doin' here? I didn't expect you to be here. - Neither did I. I mean, I wasn't expecting for you to be here either. Your mom said that you're hardly home during football season, so... - Yeah, I'm on injured reserve, so coach let me fly out, but mom, you didn't tell me that Lisa was gonna be here. - I ain't gotta tell you nothing'! - Nothin'. - This is my birthday and it's my house! - Absolutely. - Yes, it is baby. - That's right and you didn't even tell us that she was comin'. - What? - Honey, Lisa is my guest.

Well, actually I own my , but yes, I've had it for a few years now. - Really? Well, Congratulations on that. - Thank you. - Starting a business can be pretty rough, huh? I mean most businesses fail within like the first year. - I've done fairly well. Most of my clients are white collar millionaires. - Yessss! - Outstanding! - Well, I am proud of you and I wondered what you were doin after all these years. - Well Jay and I started our own clothing line. We broke a little over even this year, small profit, but we're on our way. - Right. - Heffer, ain't nobody talkin' to you. - Hmm. - They tryin' to catch up and there you go dippin' in. Small profits, but we're on our way. Heffer, let them catch up!

She's a pretty girl and all of that, but look here, you and Lisa, y'all got history. - This is temporary, five years are goin' pass, you're goin' be lookin' for Lisa and it's goin' be too late! I'm just saying, hmm? What? What uh huh. Y'all know y'all thought it, I just said it. You know what, as a matter of fact, let's get it all out there on the table, that's what we goin' do. Let's get it all out on the table, right here, right now! - Not on your sister's birthday Hamhock! - Listen, somethin' wrong? We not good enough? Me and your mama? - Hold, stop, Auntie, hold it. What are you talking about right now? - Listen, every time you bring a woman in this house, she don't never look like me and Flo, I'm tellin' ya now! if she ain't white, I'm tellin' you, if she's a black girl, - Barbara don't! - Um, I'm just sayin'. - Color has never been an issue in this house and definitely not colorism. Honey, I taught my boys that love is colorblind. - Listen Flo, that's yo son, you goin' support him, you goin' let him slide wit everything, but I'm gonna say it, because see you love him, Flo, I love him too, but I'm goin' tell him the truth. - Let her get it out! - Is this what fame does, huh? - She goin' say what she want anyway. - Is this what fame does? Is this what fame does? Get you so far away from your roots? Get you somebody that look like me or your mama and not some barbie, 'cause you sure as hell ain't Ken. - At least get someone look like your mother. At least your mama. - Whoa pops, come on, what you talkin' bout man? Come on, it's not even like that. - No, so what is the like? I mean, no disrespect to you baby, but he can do better. - No disrespect, just cause you, - Just because of what? - Just, 'cause you say "No disrespect" at the end of your insults, doesn't make it any less disrespectful. - See, this what I'm talkin' about. Get rid of her. Get rid of her nephew! - Dad do something. - What you want me to do? I tried to tell you! Besides this, this better than "Iyanla fix your life." - You know what!? - What!? - Let it go, just let it go, just let it go, leave it alone. - No! I wanna address what your aunt just said. - Hey stop, stop, stop, stop, let it go. - No! - Goin' and let her! Yeah, address me. - That's what's wrong wit' you people. - Wait. You people. Did she say "You people?" - See, see, see, look, I said leave it alone, right? Just sit down Jas. Jasmine! Sit down now. Now! - Whoo hoooo, yes! And you're just goin' let him shut you up, and sit you down like that, huh? Let me let you understand somethin' real good, honey. Jay was raised to respect women - Um hmm. - Women! All right, but listen here and had he talked to one of us like that? Lord have mercy on his soul. - Ain't that the truth? - Exactly, exactly what I'm talking about. You know what I'm saying? This is why, that I will never be with a woman like, you know what? - Say it. - No, no, no, no, it's okay, no, no, no. - No, say it. - It's pointless, just... - No, I want you to finally say it so we can know who you really are! - THIS WHY I DON'T COME HOME, AUNTIE! 'Cause you're embarrassing, look what you doing! Now, I said it! - Now, wait a minute, huh? I got to draw the line right there! Boy, you watch how you talk to your aunt. - You respect your elders, boy. - Now, I don't like her either. She's got real bad gas and she's chases all the neighborhood pets away, I know. And those claws that she calls nails, scraping up my hardwood floor. These was new hardwood floors, but she is your aunt. She practically raised you as her own. - That's right. - Apologize, to her. Apologize, to her. I said apologize! - I'm sorry, Auntie Barbara. I shouldn't have talked to you like that. - Right, you was wrong. Let you slide this time, Jonas. The next time you won't even see it coming. - Oh boy. - It'd be like a Sunday afternoon game. Come in like a line backer and knock you on your... aspirin out. You got an aspirin, Flo. - I need a cigarette. - Wait, wait, you got some weed? - Charlie, what is wrong wit you? Charlie, what is... - I got them cataracts in my eyes! - Wait, wait, now. We don't puff puff the magic dragon in this house. You gonna have to take that mess out back, where your aunt buries all her bones. - You know what? I've had enough. You, people are crazy. - Jasmine, Jasmine, where you goin'? - I need to be alone. , bye. Ain't nobody goin miss her. - You know what? I'm outta here too, you know what? I am tired of everything being about you Jonas! Here it is mom's birthday and somehow all the focus is on you. I bet you don't even know, this party is also for mom being in remission from cancer. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Mom, you had cancer? - That's right, mom had cancer and they didn't wanna tell you and worry you during your little football season. - Ma, come on, had I had known, then I would've been here. - Known what? You still wouldn't have been here! When does the superstar have time for us!? Huh? Nah, while you've been off bein' a superstar, I've been here being a son. You know who's name Nate called? Yours, but that's all goin' to change, you know what? I can't take it, mom, I'm sorry we ruined your birthday. I'm out. - Don't leave. - Come on D, don't... - Derek, Derek, Derek! I'll get him. - All I wanted, was to have family come together this weekend for my birthday and what's it come to? A hot glorified mess. - Um um, um, um. - Ma, can we please just talk about this later? - Oh yeah, we can talk about it, but right now, this is my birthday dinner and I am determined to enjoy myself. - Yes ma'am. - All right, everybody let's eat. - All right. Hey Derek! - It's just like the men to disappear, I'm telling ya now, when it's time for the domestic work to be done. - The meal was delicious, thank you. Yeah it was good.. - Anyone for some coffee? - Oh, I'll take a cup, thank you so much. - Ooohhh, no honey, you know coffee don't agree wit' me. It just keeps me up and gives me gas. Y'all know what happened last time to you, don't you? Um hm.. - Killed all the house plants too. Ooohhh! So, where did everyone else go? - They all went to go find Derek, baby. I'm just so worried about my baby. - Yeah, you know he's at that age. Tryin' to figure it out isn't easy. - You know, you that same sweet girl they left here years ago. - Awwww. - Yes, you are. Yes, you are. - In some ways I am, but a lot has happened since college. - Um - I know. - We see that. You all woman now.. - Whhoooo, girl, you got to tell us, you got to tell us about them gorgeous New York men. Ooohhh, I know you got some stories to tell. Child, I got to live vicariously through you. You know since my husband died, I ain't been gettin' no action and you know, Flo. She ain't got no story that lasts longer than two minutes. Shut up.. - It's the truth. - Auntie, there hasn't been anyone. - Nobody? - No, since college, no, I work all the time, so there's no wild stories to tell. - Okay, not even a little one night stand here, there huh? No. - Oh, what about a little bump and grind? Huh? I don't see nothin' wrong wit' a little bump and grind, huh! That keeps ya focused baby. - No one. - Oh, I just assumed somebody was tearin' that up. - Huh? You know when a woman ain't gettin' none, I'm telling you, she be mean, and cankerous like, like me. - But you sweet as pie baby. - Yes you are, yes you are. - Like many of my friends, I'm not into casual sex. I connect sex with being with the person I love and wanna spend the rest of my life with, - Hmmm. - but I wanna get married. - Amen baby, do it God's way. - That's beautiful, but tomorrow ain't promised to you baby. You better get you some, hmmm? Um hmm, yes. Get it while it's moist. - Ummm. - Yeah, 'cause when time will pass baby and you'd be dryer than the Sahara desert. I'm telling you somethin', I'm talkin' from experience honey, the struggle is real. Auntie, I'll - It's real. - I see. - Yes. Get it baby. DEREK!? DEREK!? DEREK!? - Baby listen, you know, I try not to pry and I tried to stay out of you and Jonas' business, - Until now, hell. - Baby, what happened between you and Jonas? He doesn't talk about it. - My heart was broken. - Um. - It's like a whirlwind of emotions just came rushing back. Feelings that I thought were gone. - Where you think you goin'? - Nowhere, man. I'm here. - Punkin' out? - Nah, let's go. - All right, follow me. - Let's do this! - But baby, you held it together. - Um hm. - Um hm, yes you did, 'cause I would've slapped the taste out of Jasmine's mouth, I mean that, yes, I would've. - It wasn't easy. - I believe you. - After all these years I can't believe I still love him. Ha! I knew it, I knew it! Um um um. - If falling out of love is so hard, why is that? Like, how do you turn love off? - You can't! - You can't turn that off, baby. And it seem like you ain't ready to just move on, are you? But you got to tell us what happened. - Things changed. You know, when we went to college, the us became about him. - Um. - Then there was a popularity and the girls. Long story short. I caught him with a girl in his room. - NO! And you didn't call me? Came up there and set it off, you know that? - Baby, I didn't know he cheated on you, honey I raised him better than that. - Yes. - Yeah, you know, I just, that day I ran back to the dorm, I packed my things, I left that night. I transferred to another college, I never looked back. - Um, um, um. - Seems to me that you two have some unresolved issues, but if you two still have feelings, maybe things can work out. - Nah Flo, now I love Jonas like my own son, but he was wrong, what he did was wrong baby and who's to say he wouldn't do it again. Men, money, and power, I'm telling you, that's a dangerous combination. It is for you know, God forgives. - Ohhhh, here we go! ♪ Ohhhh Bible Study, Bible study 101, ♪ ♪ please turn to your neighbor. ♪ Stop.. - What you want us to say, Flo? What you want to say, always takin' us to church. - Look, all I'm tryin' to say - What? - Is that people learn from their mistakes, love takes time, love is a test and it's heartbreak and forgiveness. - Um hm, um hm. - Finally goin' be one of us now, homie. - Make it official. - Man, he ain't ready. - Hit that real quick. - Yo, you scared? - Man, you got baby lungs. - Yeah. - Baby, you got to seize the moment. Sometimes you only get one chance. I remember when I was dating this other young man, and Johnny had eyes for me, everybody in my family loved this young man, because he was perfect. - Yes! - Good family and marked for success. - Um hm, Kevin, um hm, I liked him. I wanted him. Oh yeah, I did. Who didn't. - Then there was Johnny. Johnny was from the poor side of town, didn't have much to offer. Ooohhhh, sugar wugar, baby, darling, dear! Um. Johnny made me feel so special. I loved him before I even knew I did. - What do you mean by that? - See, one day I heard that Johnny was leaving town and I didn't know if I'd ever see him again or if he'd ever come back. - Um. - But I knew that if I didn't seize the moment, I'd lose out on my once in a lifetime love. Baby, that's the day, I told him I loved him. - That is a beautiful story Mom Johnson. - Thank you baby. Gives me goosebumps, ooohhhh, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! Oh, excuse me. I'm getting a little restless. I'm gonna go ahead and head to my parent's house and get some rest. - No baby, stay right here. - Yes. - Got plenty of space. - But what about Jonas? - They're at a hotel. I got clothes for you, stay here with us. - Oh. - Stay here. I tell you what we gotta do though. We got to get outta here. Gotta go to Wally World, they gotta sale like nobody's business. I need to get some girdles and everything. - Well, I have you blocked in, so you're more than welcome to take my car. - Ohhhh, now that's real good of ya, they acts a fool over there, you know when they say... this is a holiday, you know how the holiday sales are. Girl, I may pick me up, I mean a real good spanks - I'll take that baby. - Have you noticed I lost some weight? - I have, you look gorgeous. Thank you. - I got two more bowels to move. - Well, you sapsuckers get on in here. Get the losin'. Get the losin' started. Get on over here. Get to it! Whooo... Jasmine okay? - Yeah, she's at a girl's house, so I'll, she'll be back later on tonight. - I'm glad she's okay. - Yeah, well, I see Lisa's car's gone, is mom and auntie still here? - Well your mama went shoppin' and I don't smell Bengay around the house, so your aunt must be wit' her. - Look here, we goin' play some cards or what? - Yes and we'll wait for Derek while we play. - Yeah, when Chris gets here, we'll get started. - Chris!? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I ain't seen him in a month of Sundays. That boy was so jealous of you. - Who Chris? Nah pops, come on man. - Yeah, well, how is he? Better yet, how's his breath? Charlie, this boy breath was so bad, it's like he walked in wit a stranger and sat him down next to you. You're like, " Ooohh Lord, who is this?" - Crazy, you know that right? - Yeah. - Chris is good, lives up in the Hills right now, - All yeah. - it's good. - In the Hills with the rich folk. Yeah. He still acting stuck up? - Stuck up? Chris? - He act like a white woman in the suburbs raised him. - Matter of fact, my boy's here right now, what's up big dog? - What's up brother? Hey man, hey Mr. Johnson! Haven't seen you in a while. - Well, you see this. I see you grown into that big old head of yours. Boy, I used to feel sorry for yo neck. It was like any minute. - Already goin' in man, he ain't changed. - Hey man, I'm cool, I got to get thick skin. - Get this Spades goin' now. - Look here, you ain't said nothin' but a word, now I'm ready to put in a whooping on all y'all. We playing for money, right? 'Cause look here. I am ready to double my social security check! It ain't everyday, I get to play with a rich NFL` player. - So, that's what it's about unc? You tryin to empty my pockets, man? Hell yes! Now, let's get it! Empty the trash, ahhhh um. All right, come on, deal 'em. - Wait, wait, wait, you ain't gonna answer her texts? - Nope. Don't matter. She goin' call regardless, five, four, three, two. Hello? Yes, Flo. I sure will. Upstairs? Um hm. Trouble? All right. All right bye bye. Whooo. - Now how'd you know she was goin' call? Simple, I married a black woman. - You need to get one of what I have. - What is that? I mean, is that a blow up doll? I mean, just seems like you have trouble gettin' the real thing. - Nah. Anything other than a black woman. - Boy, you better get out my house, talkin' that crazy mess! Before I come over this counter. - Hurry on man! Come on. - Let's work. Man, we ain't got all night, let's go! Look at him lookin' scared. - Take it like a man. - Yeah, that's right. - You bout to get knocked out! - Yeah, let's get it. - Yeah, we gone get you now. - Yeah, you scared? You scared? - What's good? What's good? - Hit him, hit him! - Yeah, you scared? What you goin' do now? - Aight, let's get it, come on! - Get off me! - Yeah, let's get him! Get him! - Come on man! - Aight! - My lady would've never even thought about interrupting me. - What you say? - She would've just taken the trash out herself. The only interruption, is bringin' me an ice cold beer. - Now he does have a point there, pops. Certain women just get it, pops. Now we men, so we real simple, right? All we care about is women that can cook, give us peace of mind and great sex! - Speaking of which, they really know how... Wait, stop right there , I'm not goin' sit here and listen to this. You ain't never been with a black woman to compare! - Man, I have! - You have? - I have. - He hasn't, 'cause everybody knows that a sister puts it down, all right? And that's why your mama got the championship ring. I told you bout her! - Sho nuff. On our wedding night, you hear me? Yo mother backed that thing up on me like, had me singing ♪ My, my, my, my, my... ♪ - And you goin' chime in unc? Come on pops, stop. - That's how good ya mama made me feel. I'm talkin' about your mama, boy. - I know you talkin' about her and that's why I want you to stop. 'Cause look pops, times have changed, right? People have evolved since your ancient era. - No, no, son. The problem is young people today, believe whatever the media tells them. The media lies to us son. The media, they lie to us every day to try to get us to do what they want us to do. Like puppets. We see it, we believe it. Don't follow the crowd boys. - AYE! This yo boy, you go first! - What's up!? - Yeah! Let's go! - That's enough. - Come on, I got you, man. Come on. - Okay, I hear you. Case and point, Jonas, remember the type of car I drove in college? - Yeah, little hoopty, Chevy - hatchback, yeah. - , yeah that. Anyway, I was tryin to holla at the sistas. They didn't wanna talk to me, because the type of car I drove. - Wait a minute, wait, wait, how'd you get your head, yo big old head in that little bitty car? Better yet, how'd you get another brother in the car wit' you?. - Wasn't no room in the car, Charlie! - Any way, I didn't have a lot of money back then. I couldn't afford to take 'em places and buy 'em expensive things and they was always sayin' stuff like you talk too white or relax, you walk too stiff. - You do. - Okay, okay, but look, I was never black enough for the sistas. So, guess what? I stopped comin' their way. - Yeah, yeah, get it all out, yeah. Is that it? - I don't know Johnny, the boy kind of preachin'. Shut up Charlie! - But, let me tell you when my life changed. When I started datin' other races. They didn't ridicule me for not having money. In fact, they saw what I could become, - What you could become? - but when a brother made a come up, started driving that Bentley, all the sistas wanted one. I'm like, "Oh, now you wanna holla at a brotha." It's too late! I started throwing up my own stop sign. Boy, sit yo $5 butt down!. - Boy, I'll make change on you. Okay!. - Yeah boy, you are suffering from Black Dateless Syndrome, that's all that is. - Look here, my office hours are nine to five. Maybe his shirt's too tight, Charlie. - Boy I swear, does it snap in the middle, like a leotard? - Yeah, I think I saw one of his balls hanging off to the side too. Ugh. Ugh, ugh!. Man, don't worry about it.. - What you laughin' at? With that goat shirt on. Mariachi or somethin' like that. - Well, my sponsor pays me to wear this shirt, so it don't matter, sir. - Anyway, I'm tellin' you, black love, good black love still exists. - Um hm. - And look here, no woman is perfect and there's good and bad in every race, but the problem with you young fellas is, y'all's too busy following the trends! You need to get with a woman that's good for you, no matter what her race is. - See your mother, I tell ya, man, she was with me when I didn't have two nickels to rub together. I couldn't even afford to buy her a wedding ring. I take it in a string and I tied it around her finger, promised to buy her diamond ring someday. Your mother wore that string around her finger proud all that time and never cared about what anybody had to say about it. - Wait, wait, wait, pops, this story true? - Huh? - Huh? Is it true? - You mean... Nah, nah, it wasn't true. - Johnny, man dang! - Come on pops, man! - You know what I'm saying? The point, listen to what I'm sayin'! The point is... your mother is a good woman! - Um hmm, Flo's a good woman and she thick too. - Hey, watch your mouth. Hey, that's enough about my wife's onion, all right? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Now, at the end of the day, your mother, she holds me down and at the end of the day, that's what every man needs. - Um hmm. And you know, for years, black women have been gettin' a bad rap for bein' strong, - Um. - but most people fail to realize why they needed to. - Educate these youngsters, Charlie. - Um hmm, well look here, they raisin' sons with no father. - Yes. - We got 2 million imprisoned black men and most with no fathers. - That's right, Jay, you always tryin' to get me to move out of this neighborhood. These young boys need us, but I'll make you a deal. You build that community center, you start those programs and I'll entertain your offer to buy me a house. - Okay, that's a deal, pops. - All right. - Hold up! How did we get on this topic? You, knucklehead! - You know what? You two failed to mention the two most important things in a relationship. - Talk about it, Charlie. - And that's love and respect. - Yes, sir. Now for a woman's got those two things, oohh Lord, she'll do anything to you. - Charlie, you mean anything for you, right? - Yeah, that's what I meant. Yes.. - Now Jonas, look here. I saw how you was lookin' at Lisa earlier. - Yeah, yeah, I had to keep my eye on Jesus when she walked in. - Whhoooo, oooohhhh, ooohhh, little sweet tenderoni! - Yeah, she's still lookin' good, man, but look, she left me. I mean just disappeared. - Well, what did you do? - Pops to this day I have no idea, man. - Wait, am I missing something? Lisa's in town? - Yeah and she looks amazing man and the cold part about it, I couldn't even hide it from Jasmine. - Sounds like y'all got unfinished business. Yep, you still love Lisa? - Why would he go back to Lisa? Remember she left him. - All right, y'all ain't tryin' to play no cards. Listen, I'm startin' to feel like Dr. Phil. I'm goin' to bed and Derek better get his butt in this house. - Wait, now I still need to deduct my social security check now! - I know you're not seriously considering this. - Aye man, I owe it to myself to see what happened between us and if they're still something between us. - No man, she had a chance bro, a woman like Lisa, she doesn't deserve men like us. - Hold on, why do you care who I'm with? - Come on Jay, man, I just don't wanna see you get hurt. - I respect that - Yo Jay, what happened to D, man? - Ayo pops! Pops! - What happened Jay? - Derek, what happened to my son!? I'm not gonna ask you again, what happened to my son!? - It was a gang initiation! - Got you lil bro. - Come on Flo, answer the phone. Answer the phone! - Yo Chris, need you to hold the spot down for me, man. - I got you. - Anybody call, we at the Bayview Hospital. - Somethin' bad happened to Derek! Meet us at the at the Bayview Hospital! - You're goin' be all right, dog. - Oh man, this place... - Mama Johnson is that you? Who's there? - It's Chris. Lisa!? Is that you? - Chris? What are you doing here? - I can ask you the same. - I was upstairs taking a nap when I heard noises. I wasn't expecting to see you here. - I bet you weren't, I reached out to you a few times, but... - Where is everyone? You mean Jay, Jasmine for something, but everyone else, I'm not sure. - Okay, it's gettin' late, I'ma go turn it in for the night. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You don't gotta be so quick to leave. Why don't you stay and you know, keep me company til everyone returns? - Why Chris? Remember? I was never good enough for Jonas. - Hmm. You remembered that. We were kids, let's leave the past in the past. Besides, I was just tryin' to protect you from Jay. - Derek! Hang in there Derek! We got you man! Hang in there! Go! Hurry up! Go! Go! - Go home and wait for your mama, just in case she doesn't get my message. - Okay. - Derek, hold on, son. Hold on now. Pull up right here in the front, right here in the front! - And I'm supposed to thank you? And why the hell you keep sending pictures to my DM's? 'Cause we're not friends! - I did what I did for you. You a sweet girl. - What are you doin'? - Remember, I liked you first, Jay just got in the way. I guess you like that football star type, huh? Back then I was just this tall, skinny kid wit' a big head, but I'm all grown up now. - Um and clearly I see you've grown into your big ego too. - And a bank account to match it. I see the way you be lookin' at me. - I'm looking? Nah, see you got it all.. - Wrong? I don't think so. This is a time for us to finally be together. I don't see what you saw in Jay, anyway. - What? Be together, nah Chris, see now you trippin. - Look, I was the one deserving of you, not Jay. Everything was given to him and he never appreciated it. - I've never felt that way about you. It's always been about Jonas, never about you. - Jonas, Jonas, Jonas. I'm so tired of that name. - Leave now and maybe I won't tell him what his supposedly best friend said. - FORGET JAY! You know you want this! - What!? Chris, no! - Lord, I'm so glad I charged up my phone, I would've never gotten that message from Johnny! Oh God! Now, I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. Lord,! - I'll take what I want, rather you wanna give it to me or not. Go ahead, go ahead. Beg for it. - Chris stop! - Go ahead, beg for it. - You trippin'. - I'll like it even more. - Get off of me! - I can't stand women like you! Think you're too good for a brother! - Chris, think about what you're doing, you're making a big mistake. Someone can walk in here, anyone. - SO!! No one's gonna believe you! It's my word, against yours! - Chris stop! Chris stop it, what are you doing? - Hey man! The hell's goin' on in here!? - He tried to rape me! - Tried to rape you? What's wrong wit' you! - Man, ain't nobody try to rape that girl! - Time for you to leave, Chris. - So it's like that, man? You just gonna believe her? - Hey hey! One thing I know about Lisa, she ain't a liar, dude! - So, it's like that? - Yeah, it's like that. All this damn time, you've been tryin' to make me stray away from Lisa, huh? Tryin' to block what God has had for me this whole time, right? - You know what you know? You know I loved her first. - Huh? - All through high school and college. Man, you had the best girls, the nicest cars, everything came so easy to Jonas. I was just 'posed to sit around and get yo sloppy seconds, but you know what, man, she ain't all that anyway. - Okay, leave now before I call the police! All right. - Hey, you okay? Yeah,. Aye , before I go, you ever wonder why Lisa broke up with you? I would know, because I set it all up. - Chris, what are you doing? Don't do this. What are you talking about? - Nothing Chris, please. - Sweet Jasmine, glad you could make it, aye, we're all here and they need to know. - He doesn't need to know. - I don't need to know what Jasmine? - Nothing, Chris, please... - Get! - No. - What!? You like stories? I got a doozy for you, bro. - Yeah, okay. - Once upon a time, I paid a girl to be in your apartment naked, then I called Lisa, and I told Lisa to come to your room and when Lisa got there, sweet Jasmine was there. She answered the door butt ass naked. - Jasmine!? - So, that's where I know you from? Just a little confession before we part ways, brother. - No, he's not worth it! he's not worth it - Jonas, I'm sorry you had to find out like this. You supposed to be my man, huh? How are y'all goin' do this to me? After all I did for you and you, huh!? - Jasmine ain't nothing but a gold digger. As for me, I got tired of seeing everything go your way. Then you not giving a damn about no one, but yoself. - Jonas, I was that person back then, but I'm different now. I do love you. - I do. - Love, love. Is that the same love that just had you in my bed earlier tonight? - You know you've been bribing me since college. Jonas, I do love you. - Look, - I do. - Has he told you that he lost his $40 million contract when he hurt himself? Hey, still love him? I bet you ain't even told your family, did you? The great Jonas Johnson. How does it feel to be tossed aside? - Feels like I'm the same and you'll never be like me on your best day. So, on my mama, you better get outta here dude! All right, I'll leave, but hey, before I go. I told you I've been with a black woman. - I'm sorry. - Let's GO! - Goodbye Jasmine. No, no, no, no, no, baby, baby, it's over. They're out of our lives.
