You think he's spending the night up in here? Now she gonna write about Nurse John in her book! "Dear Ms. Rain, "AII the years I sit in cIass, I never Iearned. "Now I got a baby again by my father. "I wish I had a boyfriend Iike other girls. "Then I'II feeI right that I have to quit schooI. "I Iove my baby, but I want schooI, too. "Social worker ask me if I wanna give IittIe Mongo "and AbduI up for adoption. l could kill her. "She never helped before. Now she wanna take my kids away? "If she takes AbduI, I won't have nothing no more." "Dear Precious, "I think your first responsibiIity has to be to yourseIf. "If you keep AbduI, you might have nothing. "You're Iearning to read and write. That's everything. "You come back to school when you get out of the hospitaI. "You're onIy 17." This looks like a big-ass condom. Use that for Nurse John. Not looking like that. Your hair looks a mess. -l'm giving you banjee. -Shut up! l got yourjournal. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing. Are you sure? Yeah, l'm sure. All right. l'm bored. l'm about to leave. Bye. Bye, Ms. Toosie. You got a nasty-ass mouth. You got a nasty-ass hat. That's what's wrong, you hanging out with bitches like that. Here's your baby. lt's probably the last time you're gonna ever see him. Grandmother come and visit and say, "Only a dog would drop a baby and walk off." Not even a dog. Say later, "Not even a dog." l'm proud of you. Ain't nothing like your mother. "Where was your grandmother when your father was abusing you? "Where is IittIe Mongo now? "What is going to be the best thing for you in this situation?" "Ms. Rain, you ask too many questions. "Sometimes I wish I could stop breathing. "I just wanna be a good mother." "Being a good mother might mean Ietting AbduI be raised "by someone who's better abIe than you to meet his needs." "Ms. Rain, I is the best to meet my chiId's needs." "Who's gonna heIp you? "How wiII you support yourseIf? "How wiII you keep Iearning to read and write?" "The weIfare heIped Momma." "You look and see how much weIfare has heIped your mom. "You could get your GED, "and go to coIIege. You can do anything, Precious." You back? What's his name? Can I hold it? Hey, Precious. Hey. You had the baby? A boy. Where you been all this time? Let me see him. Can I hold him? He look like his daddy. He named Abdul. Put all this shit down and go get me something to drink. You bitch! -You fucking bitch! -You crazy, Momma? Am I crazy? Bitch, if I was to... You ruined my fucking life! You done took my man, you had those fucking babies, and you got me put off the welfare for running your goddamned stupid-ass mouth! l ain't stupid and I didn't take your man. Your husband raped me! Didn't no-fucking-body rape you! Bitch, don't you put your fucking hands on me! Mary, leave that girl alone! Can I see the baby now? B... C... D... E... F... G... H... l... J... K... l'm tired of shopping. Yes, because they all trying to take your money. They don't... l'm calling the cops. Tell me what you see back there. I couId teII by Ms. Rain's face I ain't gonna be homeIess no more. I just don't know where I'm gonna end up, though. l'll hold. l feel bad for her. She just an ABC teacher. She ain't no social worker. What's going on? But she all I could think of. Look, when the others get here, tell them to start writing. And whichever one of you is older is in charge, okay? Consuelo, I know that's not you. Come here. Ms. Rain, I can't stay. l'm serious. l've tried to talk... Consuelo, you're not leaving class and l'm not dealing with this right now. Take this money. Go get something for Precious to wear. Quick. And bring back my change. Sixteen years old. A three-day-old infant. The baby not bleeding. l think this is Precious' blood. Well, why didn't you tell me that before? We'll find you a place to live. Joann, you're late. Rhonda, you ain't the teacher. Joann, Ms. Rain is busy with Precious today, so I am the teacher today. Okay. Why? -Where's Precious? -Just sit. Pull out your notebook. Joann, you wanna say one of your raps to the baby? What's the baby doing here? -Joann's gonna rap for you. -Let me see. She all right. She's doing good. Why is the baby wrapped up in a blood-covered blanket? -Joann, what's so funny? -For real. What happened? You don't wanna know is how it got on the blanket. You know what your problem is, Joann? That you can't take anything serious enough. -Jermaine, me expect better from you. -Okay, Rhonda. Joann, stop laughing at this baby. Queens. Let me call you back. Just tell me what happened! No, it's not funny. But Joann, there's nothing funny about a baby with blood on it. l got a West lndian friend who's a Council member. Let me see what she can do. Hold on a second. l found a lesson plan in our notebooks. We're gonna... Clareece Jones. Hey, Ms. Lisa. How you been? l don't know. l went to see that movie, Barfly, last night. Piece of shit. -l'm sorry. -lt's on my desk. Can you hold? Something's wrong with you, Precious. This baby stink. Well, we don't have a Pamper, so have a seat with the baby. -l am sitting. -ln your seat, please. The first thing is shut the bumba-ros-clot... Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda teach the class? She don't even know how to speak English. Let Rhonda take over. -Shut the bumba-ros-clot up. -What the fuck is a "ros clot"? Yeah, Brenda, you there? The last four of the Social are... 2-4-2-1 . -Rita? -l just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius." -Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"? -lt's A-Q-U-A-R-l-U-S. Can you spell "boy" then? Can you spell "slut" then? Let's explore that. You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo, l'll give you the first letter. Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then? Great, thank you. Can you please use "slut" in a sentence? Consuelo is a slut... -You the one who's the ho up in here... -Joann is not a slut. Perfect. You get a gold star. But you know she likes that. Well, she's just insecure. -You think? -Yeah. -That chicken was good. -Really good. Did you have enough? There ain't more, is there? -ls there more? -Yeah. Maybe later. Not now. l don't want you to think l'm greedy. You're not greedy. lf you're hungry, let's get you some more. l guess I kind of eat too much sometimes, though. No, you don't. -Blu, is that you? -Not always. What are you doing here? l live here. Why didn't you tell me? -Hey, sweetie. -ls this... ls this... This is Katherine, Precious. -Are you okay? -lt's so nice to meet you, finally. Oh, my God. These straight-up lesbians. -This is Abdul. -He's gorgeous. He looks just like you. Precious, can I hold him? You know how to? They stiII nice enough to Iet us stay in their home untiI I get situated, though. -He's heavy. Oh, my God! -You wanna hold him? I guess this is how the peopIes on TV feel at Christmastime. -Don't drop him. -Come on. I only work with children. You know how you are. I saw you... When we were putting up the tree, you dropped half the top of it. They're so nice to me and AbduI. -Be careful. Hold him with both hands. -Please. Oh, Abdul. Merry Christmas, Precious. Thank you. Why peopIes that bareIy know me should be nicer to me than my mother and my father? l felt warm. -What? -l'm just... l'm just concerned about the baby and the cats upstairs. They're fine. Grandmother's scared of Momma. I know that's why she ain't Ietting me stay with her. lf Ronald McDonald were running things... Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing. l bet she ain't scared of Momma. Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious? Just write the book. -Well, who's gonna read it? -Nobody, if you don't write it. You know, Precious writes every day. You should try it. ls that right? What do you write about, Precious? Stuff. My life. Abdul. How come y'all don't like McDonald's? Katherine was just drawing a comparison so that her point could be more easily understood. Yes. They taIk Iike TV channeIs I don't watch. My Uncle Clayton. I'm gIad AbduI here to Iisten in on them, though, 'cause I know they're smart. Before he got saved, he used to smoke like a chimney and drink like a fish. I don't understand a word they're saying. You understand? Y'all be watching Oprah? No. I don't, actually. You know what time I get home from work. -l watch it. -Momma say homos is bad peopIes. But Momma, homos not ones who raped me. And what do that make you? Homos not ones who let me sit in class aII them years and never Iearn nothing. The homos not ones who sell crack to peopIes in Harlem. -...that I have ever seen. Tell her! -That doesn't work. l wonder what Oprah got to say about that. Ms. Rain is the one who put the chaIk in my hand, made me queen of the ABC's. After I settIed at the haIfway house, I worked my hardest to memorize Ietter sounds, writing in the journaI, and reading smaIIer and fatter books. Then I found out the Mayor's office give me a Iiteracy award and a check for progress. One, two, three. The party is on. Go, Joann! Let me see what you got! Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows, all the staff was out there. Even Ms. Katherine showed up. Precious. What's up? What's that? What does it look like? Plastic stupid apple. A little something for you. -ls there more money in it? -You're so greedy. Yo, who's that? What? -What? -Come on. Precious, where are you taking me? What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah? Wait a minute. Hold on, girl. Yeah... My mom called last night. And we don't really have a relationship. We don't talk, because she really has a problem with... Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peopIes. I think maybe some of them was in tunneIs, and in that tunneI, maybe the onIy Iight they had was inside of them. Then I thought about how strong you've had to be. And then, even Iong after they escaped that tunneI... -l'll help you clean up. -Okay. ...they stiII be shining for everybody eIse. That's Ms. Rain to me. "Award for Outstanding Achievement." In a book I read, this Iady escaped to a haIfway house. And when she was there, she asked the peopIe there what a haIfway house was. They toId her it was haIfway between her old life and where she wanna be. That's kind of nice. That aIso mean I can't stay here forever. There's stiII a way to go. It'd be something to get my own apartment. AbduI nine months and aImost waIking. He's smart, too. I've been reading to him since the day he was born. He's bareIy taIking, but he's aIready counting. Momma, Daddy, IS 1 1 1 , 444 Lenox aII seem Iike some oId, bad dream. I wish I couId've just started out here, but still with Abdul. I'm gonna get Mongo, too. I gotta get Mongo back. Hey, Miss Cassidy. Hey, Precious, somebody downstairs for you. -Who is it? -l didn't ask who it was. You want me to watch the baby? No, I gotta go down and get him anyway. Your daddy dead. That's all? He had that AlDS virus. There you go, dreaming again! Precious, do you hear me taIking to you? Did you hear what I said? You got it? Got what? -The AlDS virus. -No. How do you know? We never did it up in the ass, so I know. You better get to a doctor, Mom. You coming home? Yo, Precious! Rita, what do I mean when I say the author describes her protagonist's circumstances as "unrelenting"? l don't know. I don't know. lt's like, say, like if Rita, she tries to do something, and she's going and she's going, and me, I try to stop her and she no stop, she keep on going. Relentless-un. l'll see you tonight. Bye. Come with me. Precious? Excuse me? Nurse say l'm HlV positive. l ain't got nothing to write today. ls your baby okay? He all right. l just got to stop breastfeeding him. Remember, you once told me you never really got to tell your story. -Write. -Fuck you! You know nothing of what l've been through. l ain't never had no boyfriend. My daddy said he gonna marry me. How he gonna do that? lt would fucking be illegal! Write. l'm tired, Ms. Rain. lf not for yourself, then for the people who love you. Nobody loves me. People do love you, Precious. Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain. Love ain't done nothing for me. Love beat me, raped me, called me an animal, make me feel worthless. Make me sick. That wasn't love, Precious. Your baby loves you. l love you. Write. What are you thinking? You never told me about your relationship with your mother. l didn't, did l? Really, l'm here to help you. You can talk to me. This is a safe environment. You're right. We could talk about your daddy instead. We could talk about my mother, my father, my aunts or my sister or my brother, but none of it's gonna help you. You don't even like me. Have we not been in this room together for, like, a year, discussing your life? Does that mean we like each other, because we discuss my life? l can't speak for you. l can only speak for me, and I do like you. I do. So, are you ltalian, or... What color are you, anyway? Are you some type of black or Spanish? What color do you think I am? No, l'd like to know. What color do you think I am? My throat is dry. Your throat is dry? lt's really hot in here. lt is kind of hot in here. l'm gonna go get a soda. What do you want? Soda sounds fine. All right. Thank you. No problem. So, I have to talk to you about your mother, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about this, but she says she wants to see you and she wants to be reunited with you and her grandchildren. She wants to come and have a session here with you. What did you tell her? l said I had to speak to you about it. lt's up to you. l don't know. l never thought about it before. Ms. Weiss said in that fiIe I got HIV. She said I was supposed to die from it. I ain't worried about dying. Shit, I gotta worry about how I'm supposed to raise these kids. l was just writing, like, about... l wanna open up this clinic about, like, mothers and their children. You know, just, if they're sick or something like that. l always wanted to do that, give back to the community. Because I know my mom would be proud of me if I did that, and my children, too. l want my children to be proud of their mother, you know? -That's always what I wanted to do, so... -That's good. That's really nice. l don't really want to read the whole thing, l kind ofjust wanna say what it's about. Okay, the counselors at Advancement House, they were quizzing me about my mother and my father, right? But it's not really about them. They're trying to get me to do workfare. -They want me to be a home attendant. -How do you know? Because I stole my file and I read it. All they want me to do is work. Now, I do wanna work, but not for no welfare check. What kind of sense that make, for somebody like Precious to quit school before she got her GED and go work for some old white people somewhere? She ain't never gonna be nothing if she gets stuck in some shit like that. Rhonda used to home attend. She used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach. Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be working there all day and night. She'd be on call, right? She made $6.37 an hour, but for only eight hours. That equal out to $50.96. But that's not a whole lot of money, especially 'cause, for real, she there for 24 hours. So, $50.96 divided by 24 is $2.1 2 an hour. That's not a lot of money. She said that old bitch would ring a bell, like, a real-life, actual bell when she wanted something from her in the middle of the night. -You don't want to do that shit. -Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda! Them home attendants be working for, like, six days a week. l'd only see Abdul on Sunday. Plus, l'd have to leave class. Well, that's not an option. You're not leaving class. Plus, l'm gonna start going to insect survivor meetings. lt's "incest." -That ain't what I said? -No, you said "insect." What's the difference? Well, one's where your family molests you, the other's like a roach or bugs. -So, you a scientist now? -l'm just saying. No, that's cool. Thank you. Thank you. It was hard teIIing them strangers there what my father did. Sometimes it felt good. Last week, Ms. Rain asked us to write down what we wanna be like. I wrote that I be reaI skinny, with Iight skin and Iong hair. Loretha Holloway? Go on back there. She read it and said l'm beautiful like I am. But, there's no kids back there for me to play with. Just shut up and sit there, then. Gonna talk to this lady before my shit gets cut off. But somehow, right now... And I don't know why, but... I think she right. Here. Clareece Jones? I think she right. Okay, Mrs. Johnston, let's talk about the abuse. There were no drugs in my house. l didn't play that. There weren't no drugs in my house. Precious knew I would whup her ass if she gonna bring some drugs up in my house. You know what l'm talking about. l'm referring to specific sexual and physical acts involving Precious. Why you ain't say that? Yes, that. What do you wanna know? According to Precious' files, she has now had two children by your boyfriend, the late Carl Kenwood Jones, who was also her father. -Yeah. -This is accurate? Yes, Ms. Weiss. l need to know why you're here. You've been calling this office saying you want to be reunited with Precious and your grandchild. Now, I really need to know what's gone on in that home. Ms. Weiss, l understand we need to discuss it, but l'm just telling you. You said l've been calling here and l've been wanting to see Precious and my grandson. You're goddamn right I wanna see them. Because they belong to me. Okay? Now, there was a time Precious had everything, and I done told her that. And me and Carl, we loved Precious. And you need to know that. We loved Precious and we had dreams. Precious was born around the same time Ms. West's son got killed. The summertime. She was born in the summertime. Remember? Remember that? l was born in November. November. Yeah, that's right. My Scorpio child. You know... Scorpios, they can be tricky. And, l'm not saying that they lie. l'm not saying that. But you just gotta watch them. Can we talk about the actual acts of physical and sexual abuse that occurred in your household? When it first began, where it happened and how did you respond? Precious was a little girl. Try and remember how old you think she was. She was three. And I had been giving her the bottle and I was giving Carl the tittie because my milk hadn't dried up in my breasts but not from her, but because Carl was... Because Carl was sucking on them and that's what kept my milk in my breasts. And I thought that that was for hygiene. l did what my mother told me that I was supposed to do with my child, so that's what I did. And you're sitting up there and you're trying to judge me... l'm not judging you, but you're asking me for money and you're asking me to be reunited with your grandson. But, Ms. Weiss, l don't like you looking at me like that. You got this bitch looking at me like l'm some kind of fucking monster. We don't talk like this in my office, okay? l didn't want her sucking behind him, because that was nasty. And things that he was... lt was just nasty, Ms. Weiss. l had a man, and I have a child and I had to take care of both of them. Okay? Did I want Carl to touch my baby? Because I would lay my baby. l would lay her on the side of me, on this pillow and it was pink and it had this little white writing on it and it had her name, because she was precious. And I would lay my baby on that pillow and Carl would be laying on the other side and then we would... We would start doing it and he reached over and he touched my baby. And I asked him, l said, "Carl, what are you doing?" And he told me to shut... To shut my fat ass up, and it was good for her. -And what did you do then? -l shut my fat ass up. And I don't want you to sit there and judge me, Ms. Weiss. You shut up and you let him abuse your daughter? l did not want him to abuse my daughter. -l did not want him to hurt her. -But you allowed him -to hurt her. -l did not want him to do nothing to her. l wanted him to make love to me. That was my man. That was my fucking man. That was my man and he wanted my daughter. And that's why I hated her. Because my man, who was supposed to be loving me, who was supposed to be making love to me, was fucking my baby. She made him leave. She made him go away. So, whose fault was it, then? lt's this bitch's fault because she let my man have her and she didn't say nothing. She didn't scream. She didn't do nothing. So, those things she told you I did to her, who else was gonna love me? Since you got your degree and you know every-fucking-thing, who was gonna love me, who was gonna make me feel good? Who was gonna touch me and make me feel good late at night? And she made him go away, so... When you sit there and you write them fucking notes on your pad about who you think I am, and why I did it, all of that. Because I didn't have nobody. The people from Each One Teach One, they had... They called me and they told me that my baby was writing poems. ln fact, you know what, I got... Wait a minute. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks. l don't need no more money. Please. l'm so sorry. l took that TABE test again. And what happened? l scored a 7.8. Last time it was 2.8. According to that test, l'm reading at a seventh- and eighth-grade level. Next year, high school. After that, college. Well, I like you, too. But you can't handle me. You can't handle none of this. You know, I never knew what you was until this day. Not even after all them things you did. Maybe I was too stupid, or maybe I just didn't want to. You ain't gonna see me no more. Bye! l didn't want him to hurt my baby. Please, God, l didn't want him to hurt my baby. Ms. Weiss, l didn't want him to hurt my baby. l would say to him, I would say... "Carl, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?" Can you go get her back? You can do that, because that's what you do. That's what you do. l need you to go and I need you to get my baby back. You told me that I could come in here and you could get... You could get Precious to say... Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?
