Aziz, are you ready? Yes, whenever you want, Daddy. Get ready, Meriem. Let me drive on my own, Daddy. There you go. Now it's your turn. That's it, very good. That's great. Very good. No sudden movements. One, two, three! Go on, take the wheel! He drove all by himself! Bravo, Aziz! Sarra. Come on, Sarra. -Now? -Yes, now. The kids are not listening. Guys, I have a dirty joke for you. Do you mind? An imam hears a woman cursing in the street. He asks her, "Why are you swearing?" We'll laugh less with the Islamists in power. The Islamists in power? Screw them! Give me a beer. The polls place them at 40%. Enough with politics. Let's fully enjoy these moments. I found a great Arabic teacher for Youssef. You can learn Arabic with him. This way you'll be ready when they come into power, it could be useful. -What an asshole! -Go to hell. And he even said it in Arabic! You have quite a vocabulary! It hasn't been long since he came back, so he's doing quite well. Your hangover is on me. -Lucky guy. -Let him be, he's doing fine. You can't criticize her darling. She's defending her husband. Of course. Guys! Remember, we have a promotion to celebrate. To the new HR director of the entire MENA region! To Meriem! Cheers! I'm not in the position yet but I'll try to call for a meeting. I don't know yet. Either Doha or Dubai. Yes, of course. You know what? We will discuss this during our meeting on Monday, okay? Thanks, bye. Finally. Will you come to the South with me? We leave on Friday, I'll have my meeting, and we'll be back on Tuesday. A weekend in Tataouine. Hiding behind the trees now? Come on, you lovebirds! Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Today's news, Saturday, September 24th, 2011. Social protests are paralyzing several domestic sectors, calling for a general strike… I can't lose the Italian market. I'll close shop if they continue this strike. They'll appreciate having their CEO coming in to talk to them, and not just a manager. -You think so? -Yes, I'm sure. I really need to convince them. This can't continue. In Libya, thousands of refugees flee the Gaddafi regime… Hotel Sangho Tataouine, good evening. One moment, please. -Can we play it again? -No. -Please? -No, we've heard it four times. Aziz, listen to Daddy. We've heard it enough times. Please, Mommy. -Okay, just one last time. -Okay. But, really, this is the last time. Really. Come on, Daddy. -Aziz, are you okay? -Yes, Daddy. -Allah Akbar! -What is it? -What's happening? -Stay down! -Aziz? -I'm okay, Daddy, I'm okay! Aziz! Meriem! Are you okay? -Aziz! -Aziz? -He's not answering! -Aziz, answer me! -Aziz! -Aziz! There is so much blood, Fares! Aziz! Hold him! Aziz, answer me! Talk to me, my son, please! Talk to me! -Aziz! -He is not answering me! He's not answering! Help us! -Is he hurt? -It was a bullet. -Where? -Here! Please, stay here! You can't come in here. ACCESS PROHIBITED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL I'm Dr. Dhaoui, the chief pediatrician. He's in critical condition but he's alive. The bullet punctured his abdomen. -Is he going to live? -We hope so. We've stopped the bleeding. Once he's stable, we'll transfer him to Tunis. -Can we see him? -Not yet, madam. I will let you know. May God help you. Only one of you can accompany him. Go ahead. I'll go there by car. Get in. I'll be right behind you. What's…? What's going on? Your son has just undergone surgery. The bullet caused a lot of damage, especially to his liver. To avoid any risks, we've canceled the transfer. In order to save him, we were forced to cut off a large portion of his liver. We had no other choice. What do you mean by a large portion? About… 80% of it. The next hours will be decisive. We'll see how he responds and then make a decision together. -Do you have other children? -No. Why? For a partial liver transplant, if needed. -A transplant? -Yes. Doctor Dhaoui? Let's be optimistic. Please excuse me. The victims of yesterday's attack have been buried. Six national guards lost their lives during an ambush close to Tataouine. In this attack, the first of its kind, two patrols were targeted by the terrorists after a fake emergency call. According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to the six dead soldiers, a child, age eleven, was badly wounded. Alas, it's what we feared. His albumin level is very low. His liver cannot function. What can we do? After discussing it internally, we're now considering a partial parent-child transplant. So we will take some samples, to see which one of you two is the most compatible. Why isn't he waking up? That's normal, madam. He needs time. I have to go. Mr. and Mrs. Ben Youssef, you need to know that when he does wake up, your son may display some strange behaviors He might not recognize certain things or act in an incoherent manner. That's normal, after what he's been through. He might not recognize us? Clench your fist. Hold that. No, there's no need. Very well. Please, madam. Any news? No, I'll let you know as soon as the results arrive from the lab. Aziz is in good hands. Go and get changed. You can't stay like this. What did he want? Let's go and get changed at the hotel. And leave him alone? There's nothing to fear, Meriem. -No, you go ahead. -Come with me. No, Fares, I want to stay here. I won't be long. How do I need to explain this? I cannot make it. Find a solution. What? Who are you talking about? No, I can't leave my son in this state. You're the sales manager, right? Then find a way to get them back to work. Mrs. Ben Youssef? Dr. Dhaoui wants to see you. Is Aziz all right? He's fine. The doctor is in his office. Follow me. At the end, to the right, the third door on the left. Thank you. You wanted to see me? Come in, please. Please, have a seat. -Is Aziz all right? -His condition is stable. -I asked for you… -Yes, why? We have a problem with your husband's results. Fares? What's wrong? Is he sick? No, your husband is fine. What is it, then? Excuse me. Madam, I wanted to see you first to verify something. According to the results of the molecular compatibility, there's a ratio of 9%, so your husband cannot be the father of your child. Of course, you must know that there's always a margin of error. Especially since I pushed the lab to get the results to me in a hurry. Mrs. Ben Youssef, do you understand? Since Mr. Ben Youssef is not the biological father, he cannot be a donor. And you don't have the same blood type as Aziz, so there will be an automatic rejection. Please. I know that it's very sensitive subject, but it's also a very embarrassing situation for me. It is your duty to inform him. Meriem? Meriem, open up, please. You should get changed. I brought you some clothes. It's all right. It's all right, I'm here now. Come on, Meriem. -May God help you. -Thanks. Are they still in there? Hello. We're almost finished. Please wait outside, thanks. Sure you don't want any coffee? Fares? Yes? I have to tell you something. Tell me. What is it? I'm listening. Aziz, talk to me! Open your eyes! Please, madam, sir! What's happening? -Please, don't interfere! -Aziz! One, two, three, four, five… -Let go of me! -Sir, this area is off limits. Keep him on serum and under constant surveillance. What is it? The worst is over. We were able to revive him. -Operate me, right away. -Mr. Ben Youssef… I'll sign any paper I need to. Take all of my liver. -It doesn't… -Operate me, that's an order. I won't wait for the results. That's impossible… Operate me right now! If he gets hurt, you're screwed! Calm down, sir. Follow me to my office. I know what's best for my son. I'm perfectly sane, and I won't wait for the test results. That's the thing, there's a problem with your results. What problem? What problem? I'll leave you two alone. AZIZ WOKE UP. HE WANTS TO SEE YOU. The right lobe should be enough but we will need to perform some exams to be sure. -Can we do those today? -We will try. -I want them done this afternoon. -If God wills it. -Mommy? -Yes, darling, I'm here. No… Mommy. I am your daddy. Why is the Airbus A380 upside down? Someone is feeling better. It will be all right. Don't worry. We will fix everything. You will help me, right? Well? We will need the latest results to be sure. Doctor, I insist on having them today. -Of course, Doctor. -Have a good recovery. Thank you. Fares… Not now. -Abdallah Chebli. -Yes. Your receipt? Latifa Gamaoun. Your receipt? Follow me. -Fares, listen… -So that's how you got your revenge? -I wanted… -You wanted! You wanted what? Let me at least explain myself. I swear I didn't know… Are you freaking kidding me? Look at me when I talk to you! -Listen to me… -I don't want to. -I'll leave you two alone. -No need. We have nothing to say. Any news? I have Aziz's latest results. And? What's left of his liver is beginning to fail. Your son is now in a phase of severe liver failure. He needs an organ donation. We have put him on the waiting list for a transplant. I'll be the donor. We talked about this, madam. Rejection is almost certain. You don't have the same blood type. You must know that a surgery like this one might… Might what? Aziz might suffer organ rejection. He might not survive. So what can we do? Aziz is number 19 on the waiting list. Other children have priority. We must find another solution. It's important to seek compatible donors within your family. -Are your parents still alive? -Only my mother. She must go to a lab as soon as possible and undergo HLA testing. It's urgent. The waiting list will be too long. What do you mean? You know that organ donation isn't really part of our culture. We're behind in that regard. Religion beliefs don't help, and many children are waiting… Can't we move him up the waiting list? I'll pay for it. Mr. Ben Youssef, it's not a matter of money. The only solution would be… his biological father. His mother is not compatible, so his father must be. Mr. Ben Youssef, this is a complex situation with many administrative formalities. We must legally prove Aziz's relationship with his father. Our laws forbid organ donation outside of the direct family circle. -Since you are Aziz's legal guardian… -Yes, I am! …you must sign this document. This will show that you agreed to compare your son's DNA with that of his father. I am his father. Mr. Ben Youssef? The number you have called is not in service. Daddy, do you know that the A380 is the biggest airplane? Look! It has four engines, four! It can carry up to 600 people… Your son? May God bless him. Cigarette? No, thanks. Fares, please listen to me. -Let me explain. -Does Aziz know him? -Has he ever seen him? -Of course not. I don't want him to know who the donor is. Do you hear me? Here. Get us out of this mess you've put us in. Did you have many? I want to be alone with him. I, FARES BEN YOUSSEF, AGREE TO THE DNA SAMPLING… At least let me explain. Don't come in here while I'm in here. We will do alternate shifts. I'll give you six hours. At least I had the guts to tell you. My poor girl, be brave. It's going to be all right. What's wrong? Is she in pain? Today is a big day. It will be all right. Yes, I see. Praise to the groom. Wait there. I will get the gynecologist It hurts so much. I knew my son was a real stallion. Excuse me. Sir, excuse me. Yes? You left this on the bench. Thank you so much. -Let me buy you a coffee. -No, thanks. There is a cafe right across here. Please. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. My treat. -Keep the change. -Thanks, Mr. Chokri. How is your son? You are not from here? Do you have a parent in hospital too? It's a long and annoying story. You've been living abroad for a long time, right? This country is screwed. We can't even afford the joy of a family outing. They ruined it, Mr. Ben Youssef. How do you know my name? It's a small town, everyone knows each other. Thank you for the tea. I have to go. Good night. I have a solution for you. You're waiting for a donor organ, right? How do you know that? Please sit down. I want to help. Please, sit. We can get hold of one much faster than the hospital. What can you get? We can provide a new liver for Aziz. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't dare. -What? Who are you? -It's very simple. 150,000 dinars and Aziz will be saved. -What? -Every problem has a solution. You've got the wrong idea about me. Good night. Take my number. -Call me if you change your mind. -Good night. May God help you, Mr. Ben Youssef. EMERGENCIES Mommy… What are these red dots? These are stellar angiomas. They appear as a result of liver failure. How long can he hold on? Two weeks. Maybe three. Does the father know? Does he know about Aziz? Do you know who the father is? I am sorry, madam. I just wanted to help. Thank you, I will take care of this. Good morning, Mouna. Did I wake you up? I need your help, please. Do you remember Sami? Sami Kallel, who worked with us in Accounting? Do you still have his number? Sorry but I can't tell you right now. It's a long story. Do you think she might have it? I'm counting on you. He wants to see you. It'll be fine, honey. Don't be afraid. Come, Daddy. Come in. Look, I'll show you something. That's it, Daddy, we are landing. One hundred meters. Who is that? -Hello. -Hello. I'm sorry, but can you wait outside? We're bringing someone in. What? I want my son to stay on his own. This is a hospital, not a private clinic. Excuse me, but my son is very ill. And you think this little girl is here on vacation? I've tried, Sarra. What do you think? I called Mouna, who gave me the number I already have. I've called everybody, but no one knows anything. He's disappeared. I'm going crazy, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what to tell Fares. Tell me what? I'll call you back, Sarra. When is Aziz going into surgery? What's going on? Tell me what's going on! I can't find him! What does that mean? I can't find him! You didn't want to listen to me. It's been ten years. I don't even know if he's alive! -I asked all of our colleagues. -What fucking colleagues? You manage hundreds of employees, but you can't find your fucking lover? What about Aziz? What are we going to do? You did well to call me, Mr. Ben Youssef. Please. Good evening. THE OASIS CLINIC -Mounir. -Good evening, Mr. Chokri. This way, Mr. Ben Youssef. Your son will be operated here. You still have a chance to get back to a normal life and leave all this behind you. You start by paying us the first installment You pay the rest after the operation. It will all be under your control. What guarantees do I have? He would have turned 26 in November. When he was born, he already had a lung disorder. For twelve years, we moved him from hospital to hospital. And nothing, no improvement. Through his mother, we found an anonymous donor, but the state vetoed it. In this country, a father is forced to bury his son. You must bury him and keep your mouth shut, because you must not break the law. Here. REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA TATAOUINE REGIONAL HOSPITAL Where did you get this? That's not important. Where will you get the liver? Excuse me, Mr. Ben Youssef, but what's the use of knowing? Think of Aziz on his graduation day, on his wedding day. I want to know. Forgive me, son, don't you know what is happening along our borders? The war that is raging in Libya? In Tripoli alone, over 20 people are killed per day. Per day! It's a merciless war. Our mission is to make sure that it serves some purpose. We repair injustice. We give the living another chance at life. Unlike the country that is burying them. We want to help you. I know how you feel. I've been there. I wish I had been in your position and I had been given a choice, but God had other plans. I would like to meet Aziz's surgeon. As you wish. Yes, Sarra. I know it's forbidden. Please ask her to try. Please. Do you really think she would go to jail for that? I just need his number. I'm sure he has an Orange number. His name is Sami Kallel, born in 1967, just like me. She just has to punch the name into the database. -How was your flight? -Perfect. -Please, come in. -Thank you. -Hello, I'm Doctor Jedidi. -Fares Ben Youssef. Let me introduce Dr. Jedidi. She has 30 years of experience, she is the expert in transplantation. You can verify all of her achievements online. -What are my son's chances? -Excellent. What if Aziz rejects it? There won't be a rejection. We have a molecular compatibility that's above 90%, and the same blood type. How do we proceed? The procedure begins after the first installment has been paid. We will need between 36 and 48 hours to get the organ over here. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Aziz's latest clinical exams indicate the presence of an abdominal bleed. He needs to go back into intensive care. We wanted to meet with you because we discussed the issue with the team following Aziz's case in Tunis. The tests carried out on the mother's relatives were unsuccessful. And, apparently, we can't rely on the biological father. So we have to rely on the waiting list. We explained the severity of Aziz's case to the National Organ Donation Center It is my duty, our duty, to inform you that Aziz will enter a more delicate phase. What do you mean? His periods of unconsciousness may get longer. He will grow weaker and weaker. But he will be monitored. Anyway, you must keep your spirits up. And place your trust in God. Did you see what happened in Tripoli? Bullshit, they are under-armed. Turn around, boy. Mr. Ben Youssef, I will call you back later. License and ID, please. You are new in this area, right? Officer? Check the other approaching vehicle. I will take care of them. Boss, why didn't you tell me you were coming? And disturb a newly wedded man at night? You never disturb me, boss. Where did he come from? He's new. We're still breaking him in. -For your wife. Make her happy. -God bless you. Once you're in Libya, don't take the road through Wazen. What happened? We don't know exactly, but things are very tense there. Just avoid Wazen. The road to Nalut is safer. Have a safe trip. Remember to take the plates off. Come on, Aziz, let's do as we promised. I'll look after it for you. This will be over soon. Can you give me the car keys? Do you need anything? A certain Mounir will call you. He will explain what you need to do. No, don't worry. Understood. NORTH WESTERN LIBYA N90! N106, N106! N401! Come on, N51, score! We took a huge detour. Thank God Lotfi was with me. What a mess. So what do you think I should do? I didn't think about this. Do you think I can meet with him? I'm counting on you. Take him back. We're not ready. You need a notarized signature. Then you give it to the hospital administration. If anybody asks, tell them about a clinic in Tunis. Don't go into detail. Be evasive, no comments. And then? We will call you. Fuck, what a bombshell. Come here, kitty. Don't you want to play? She must be loaded. Fuck, look at her ride. How are you? Hey, talk to us. You speak English or French? Fuck, what a babe. She must be Italian. We go coffee? You, us, together? -Don't touch me! -Shit, she's Tunisian! We're sorry, sister. Why do you want to transfer Aziz? I asked you a question. Why do you want him to leave? Why leave this hospital? -Answer me! -You forced me to. What? What did I force you to do? What is the connection? What exactly do you want? You want to punish me? And Aziz? What did he do? Why take him out of the hospital? You know his condition. So this is how modern you are? Your pride takes over? Did you learn that in France? -You want to sacrifice… -I bought a liver! Is that good enough for you? Am I back in your good books? Am I a good father now? -What? -This was the quickest solution. I'm waiting for a phone call. He's getting an anonymous lobe. What? An anonymous lobe? I didn't tell you anything. Just shut up! I won't shut up, I want to know! Be careful. I'm not kidding. I found him. Okay, great! When do we operate on Aziz? Did you compare the DNA? Did you find a judge? Did he sign the authorization form? Go ahead, answer me, for fuck's sake! In 36 hours, Aziz will be operated on. Forget your scum lover, the judge, and the authorization form. Can you beat that? And you decide on all this without telling me? You have no right! No right? You want to talk about rights? You know, I could send you and that scumbag to jail. You know the law. -Please reconsider, Mr. Ben Youssef. -I want him out. Leave him with us. We've been dealing with him from the start. I've made my decision, Doctor. At least tell us which clinic he's going to. -Who's the doctor? -I have to go. Don't tell him over the phone. Go to his place and let me talk to him. No, don't tell him anything. -What should I do? -We're trying… -Go back. -I'm not moving from here. So what should I do? We're waiting for the package. It's a mess at the border. What package? -When do we move Aziz? -I will call you. -Where will you get the liver? -Never you mind. You are worse than your father. A coward, just like him. Don't you dare compare me to him! You don't scare me. Where's the liver coming from? Which border were you talking about? The cities that first rebelled against Gaddafi seem deserted, they are fields of destruction where death reigns over them. Stop here. Wait for me. Sabratha fell to the insurgents. And Tripoli will fall soon. What do we do? Take the files and burn everything! -Hurry up! -Keep your eyes open! Hurry up, they are almost here! Put the computer in the truck! -Lotfi? -Yes, boss? I'll go with Bachir. You finish off here and join us later. And Ben Youssef's liver? Screw him, save your skin. And be careful. Don't worry, boss. Burn everything, quickly! You, prepare the kids! Hurry up! Get them ready! -Talk to me. -The coast is clear. Come on, let's go! One behind the other! Slowly, don't run. One step at a time! Hurry up! Hurry up and get in the van! Don't look at me! Keep your eyes down! Get in, quickly! I told you not to call me. The surgery is long overdue. There are problems at the border. What problems? What can I do? -Hi, Stoufa. -What’s up, Mounir? -What can I do? -Nothing. Just be patient. The clinic and surgeon are ready. I'll call you. I will call you. Wait a second! Sarra, any news? Yes, Sami. Who's speaking? That's not what we agreed on. I was expecting Mounir. No way, I will pay the rest after the operation. What? What has changed? I would come if I could. I can't leave him alone in intensive care! Sami, I'm begging you. It's the only solution. How can I explain this to you? Please, we have no other choice. Yes, you're absolutely right. Promise me that I can rely on you. You brought the money? Show me the liver first. And now, the money. What is this? -I said, the money. -And the liver? -Give me the fucking money! -And the liver? -The money. -What are you doing? The money or I will kill him! Hurry up! Come over here. -Where is the liver? -Give me the money. -Where is the liver? -Give it to me! -Cut him up as you wish. -What? -Where is the liver? -Do what you want with him! Sami, I swear, I didn't know! Sarra, put him on. Let me speak to him! I'm begging you, Sami. I don't want to cause any problems. Sami, please listen! Mrs. Ben Youssef. Mrs. Ben Youssef? What? Is everything okay? Is your husband here? Why? -We need him to make a decision. -What decision? He's his legal guardian. We can't make a decision without him. -Legal guardian? I'm his mother! -Don't get upset. You obviously canceled the transfer. So, along with the team in Tunis, we'd like to try and use your liver. As you know, this will be risky, so it needs to be a collective decision. We can't seem to reach him. If you speak to him, tell him to call us. Good night. The number you have called cannot be reached. The Tunis team that will operate on Aziz is currently on stand-by. Under these circumstances and in the absence of the legal guardian, we will proceed with your signature. We can't wait any longer. You have until the end of the day. Stop that. Hey, stop it. Hey, stop it. I told you to stop. -Please take this. -No, for God's sake, no! We will care for him. Excuse me, how do I get back on the road to Tataouine? Follow this road, then turn left, then go straight ahead and you’ll find it. Thank you. Here, you must be thirsty. Slowly. Don't worry. You may go. Not so fast, my son. What? They want to operate on you? Fares, he refused. -What's the matter? -Come. Call him from my phone. -It's useless. -Call him. Fares, it's too late. Denounce me for adultery. What? Denounce us and demand a DNA test. Legally, only you can force him to. I couldn't convince him. You know what's at stake? Do you realize that? Think of Aziz. Yes, who is it? Sami Kallel? -Yes? -Fares Ben Youssef. I need to talk to you. Begin, I'll be right back. Please, I don't want any problems. Listen, it's very simple. You come with me and we fix everything, or I'll drag you to court and have you thrown in jail. You know the law. What? Put yourself in my place. I just discovered that I have a kid who's in hospital. What can I do? I have a family. What should I tell them? I don't care. I want to save my son. MINISTRY OF JUSTICE LIVER TRANSPLANT APPROVED When was he born? June. June 27th. You never replied to my messages. Why? Never tell him about me. Madam, we need your signature, please.
