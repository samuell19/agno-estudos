Around the world, girls are brought up with fairy tales. Every fairy tale has the same old story. The princess kisses a frog, who turns into a prince, and then they both live happily ever after. I also believed it, sister! But my story starts... My story begins with "The End." And my fairy tale got screwed up. THIS STORY STARTED IN 1996, IN DELHI Chapter one. Delhi... 1996. What a wonderful creature! Holy Priest, please perform a sacred ritual, so that this royal court is blessed with a child we can call ours. Offer this enchanted mango to the princess. Once consumed, she will surely conceive. Hold on. Wait a minute! That is not how babies are made. First, boys and girls need to have sex. Come, let me tell you a not-so-perfect fairy tale. I'm the hero. Kanika Kapoor. - That's Dr. Kapoor, right? - Yes. Which mother raises a child like this? Child out of wedlock! - Why does a child know this? - Mother's a gynec, after all. What else will the daughter learn? Style icon? Really? Didn't you hear what she said? Who did you learn these dirty things from? From Mamma. Shameless! I don't want to confuse my child, Mrs. Kukreja. - I run a home clinic and patients come... - Mrs. Kapoor. Miss. Miss Kapoor. I'm sorry. Miss Kapoor. But if Kanika wants to stay in this school, she will have to apologize in front of the whole school. You see, it's very important - for her moral growth. - Right. How will a lie help in my child's moral growth? Kanika will not say sorry. - Kanika has to say sorry. - No, she won't. - She will! - My daughter will not say sorry! Kishori, Kanika won't say sorry. Bina, shut up! I am sorry, I said the wrong thing... - so, I'm very... - Loser Kanika! Stop it! Silence. Loser Kanika! From a sworn princess to Loser Kanika! Nothing was normal in my life. Ever. - But could I change that? - Are you sure? Hey, what's wrong with us? Miss Kapoor! We clearly told you we don't rent flats to single ladies. But you have a little daughter, so we allowed you. But bringing boyfriends over won't be allowed. And that night, Grandma made me realize that a spinster princess can never find their "happily ever after." That's why, very early on in life, I began... the R and D for my charming frog prince. Hit him. Maybe there was still hope for my fairy tale. And the next chapter of life... "The seduction of youth!" Youthful lover and a sultry sweetheart When two young hearts meet They are bound to surrender Youthful lover and a sultry sweetheart Finally, I meet my charming frog prince. The real confusion starts now. Will you give me some, Virgin Kanika? I meant the Virgin Mojito! The princess in a fairy tale is fed with all sorts of lousy notions. They say, "Just sit and smile coyly." Bullshit! If you don't go for it, they call you a bore. If you go for it, they call you a whore! So, what exactly is a princess supposed to do? Once more! But Grandma says that if you really want to be a princess, don't do it before marriage. Please? Or do you do it for true love? Sometimes? And then, my sweet 16 turned out to be sweet and spicy. I saw the garden of roses. Is this my happily ever after? Wonder when it happened Neither I know, nor does he And then all of a sudden, at 18, a twist in my dreamy fairy tale. Came, right? It's not necessary that every love story reaches its climax. Learned this the hard way from Frog Number One, Bunny Bhatia! Moving onto the rebellious 25. Introducing frog number two, Shekhar Sinha. And still, no happy ending! But what is life without a little salt and spice that makes everything nice? Will you marry me? - Marry you? - Yes. Think about it. I'm 55. I'm a widower, I have a son... who is almost your age. I'm on vitamins. I'll live for another 10-12 years. Maybe, with your love... another 15 years. After which, everything is yours. But until I am alive, every morning... I'll sing songs by Gulzar for you. He is a friend. My buddy. Okay. Professor. My heart longs for those moments When I just sit thinking of my beloved Shall I serve lunch? And will the young girl also eat? Yes, she will also eat. Listen, this is about our neighbor Mr. Gupta. He just passed away. His gardener came to tell me to inform you. Gupta passed away. - Oh, no. - Why are there clothes strewn around on the floor? You never listen! Got an attack again? This back pain starts here and goes up to the neck! Could you help me with the shawl, please? Of course, I'll help you. Shall I fix an appointment for tomorrow? Yes, nanny. Please! Oh, my glasses. Another misfire! Me? I am a fighter. Keep calm and carry on. And then my almost perfect frog number three, Rahul Kasturia. I'm so lucky I found you. Youthful lover and a sultry sweetheart When two young hearts meet Not today. Are you cheating on me? No, I'm tired. Give me her name! Fuck. You need help. I really think you need help. You are the one who keeps saying sex is not everything. So? The only way to console the poor is to tell them that money is not everything, Rahul! The fuck is wrong with you, man! And after years of dejection, several blows to the self-esteem in the relentless pursuit of finding my prince charming, the woeful realization dawned upon me at 30! I hope I am not the problem. I am the problem! Got dumped again! I don't want to die alone. Kanika, why are you lying on the floor? Laid on every bed possible, guys! So much trial and error, but still no luck! Where is my prince charming? You'll find him. It'll happen when it has to happen! Right now, just have fun! Yeah, it's your 30th birthday! You're a mess! Let's go in. I've... I've never had an orgasm. Never? Tried everything? Yes, everything. This is because of the porn industry. They've hyped orgasms to another level! - Yeah! - The man just touches the woman... and she cums. In real life, a lot of effort has to be put in to get a woman to cum! Don't lecture me after your honeymoon! Such a show-off now that you're married! - You married my best friend! - What are you saying? Hey! - How drunk are you all?! Come. - And you... Fuck off. You've also married my best friend! Well, she's my wife now! - Come. - I want to speak to Rahul. Look, when the timing is right... you'll find love up here and the "happily ever after" down there. So, relax! Where is the right man, Tina? I am tired of searching for the right man. I think an arranged marriage is best for me. I should say yes to Jeevan's proposal! Then you'll have to subscribe to a porn channel for life! And today, on the eve of my inglorious 32nd birthday. No more! I am done. The pain of waxing reduces with frequency. But the pain of a heartbreak stabs you in the fucking gut, every time. Youth Get a bikini wax, Kanika. Or else wildlife will colonize this bush! No point, Auntie. No one visits these barren lands! But this hope... is a bitch! No matter how many times you fail, it keeps coming back and says, "Come on, give it one more shot!" Actually, Auntie. Why can't we have it all? The eternal love along with the raunchy sex! Today is the day! Arjun Malhotra. Today the floodgates will open and how... Happy Birthday, ma'am. Thank you. - Hi! - Hi! Happy Birthday, bitch! Thank you, guys! - This is so nice! - Hi. By the way, I heard you're back in the market! Thank God, dude. I was almost getting nightmares of Virgin Kanika from school. - Seriously. - So funny! - Two years... - What's up with her? Why is your daughter sulking? Did she come second in class? She's going through a breakup. - No! - That first high school romance... Yeah, that. Guys, love is always true when you fall for someone. Dude, it's exhausting, Kanika! Seriously. She would know best. She falls in love every year! Hello! Sorry. Happy birthday. You wanna talk about it? Not today. I'll call you. Is this juice or... So we aren't going to cut the cake in parking, Karan! Get it here! Just come fast. Yeah. Arjun isn't picking up my call. Don't worry, I'm in touch with him. He's coming for sure, right? - Yeah, yeah. - Are you sure he was in touch with you? What are you both mumbling about? Is he not showing up? No! Obviously, he is coming! Is he going to stand me up on my birthday? Are you mad?! Listen, tell me the truth. Not at all, dude... - Oh, look... - Here. - He's here. - There he is! He's handsome. Youthful lover and a sultry sweetheart Kanika. When two young hearts meet They are bound to surrender Youthful lover and a sultry sweetheart When two young hearts meet They are bound to surrender Hey, swagger! I find you sexy That's Kanika. Swagger! Happy birthday. Thank you. That's Tina. That's Pallavi. And that's Rushi. Who's she? Oh, my God, Kanika Didi! I am a big fan of yours! I see all your videos. You know, you are my favorite food blogger. Wherever you go, I go. Check out my profile. Oh, I am so sorry. Rushi Kalra. - Hi! - I am a trainee chef. - Nice to meet you. - One selfie? Smile? What the fuck, Arjun! Who the hell is this? This was a date. - With? - With Kanika, you fool! Who else? Dude, she's 30-plus. I respect her. Okay? So? Dude, please! Me and Loser Kanika? Where did you get this jacket? Ma'am, you need a chair? Of course, the more the merrier! Put it down! Looks nice, right? Getting so many candles was a task, bro! That's why it took time. But I told them clearly. My friend is turning 32. I need 32 candles. Couldn't you bring the candle with the number on it? - I said... - You both are made for each other! Fools. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Wait a minute. Stop! What happened? One candle is extra! I counted 33! Your math is weak. You ain't that old, babe! Happy birthday to you I get your missed call every night Actually, a hundred times a night Don't deny it! What's on your mind? Your tantrums make you Who you are They're soft on the inside And a little cold on the outside But that's a facade you put on I can't help but think of you I don't know what's happening to me Now that I dialed your number I am hooked You pick up my call But you say nothing but a yes No matter what I say You either say "hmm" or a "yes" It's my spell on you No matter what I say But you say nothing but a yes But who's ravishing? You are ravishing! What do I do? You've captivated me! Faces Such pretty ones! But don't doubt me You're hotter than all else You're my heartbeat I hold you close to me You're like a drug I'm getting addicted to you But you played me I thought you were sweet like sugar When you called me your sweetheart But you turned out to be spicy! I can't help but think of you I don't know what's happening to me Now that I dialed your number I am hooked You pick me my call And say nothing but a yes No matter what I say You either say "hmm" or a "yes" It's my spell on you But you say nothing but a yes No matter what I say You either say "hmm" or a "yes" But who's ravishing? You are ravishing! What do I do? You've captivated me! Bartender, could you give me a screaming orgasm, please? You know, I've never had one! What? No. Never? I'm a defective piece! I get turned on by just looking at myself in the mirror. These days I am seeing only doom in the mirror! This is the very problem. You've become negative. It's not a medal. You don't have to win it. Sex is a blast. Talking from experience. You hooked up with Arjun? Arjun? Arjun, dear. Oh, Arjun. No, dear. I mean, he is sweet and all, but I only do first base with these uncle types. Are you sure you're just 23? You're too cute, babe! - Fuck, babe! - Sister! I'm just an old prude. Shall I give you some advice? Do with the one who loves you. Not the one whom you love. What? Okay, English? "Do it with the person who loves you. Don't do it with whom you love." What happened? Mom and Jeevika are sleeping here. - There's no power in their room. - Sorry. Kanika... Oh, my God! - Quiet... - Sorry. Kanika, you should have called me from the party. I would have picked you... How do I look? You always look superlative! No. How do I look today, right now? Something new? Something extra? Something different? Just think of it like this, dear... that if mom wasn't home tonight, then... Then? Would you have taken advantage of me? What are you saying, Kanika? Never. Why? Take advantage of me. You have my permission. Take it. Please take advantage of me. I have only one fantasy, Kanika. What is it? To see you wearing just a T-shirt. Mine. And you are cuddled up to me. Not bad. Right here on this bed. We are... Yeah? - I can feel the heat between us. - Yeah. And then? Then you... No, I am stroking your hair. - You delicately take off my glasses. - Yes. Outside, it's drizzling. Snacks are served with tea. We both enjoy the snacks. And what about sex? Kanika. Oh, my mom! - Oh, God! - Mom! Sorry! Sorry, Auntie. It's me, Kanika. Kanika, at this hour? It's my birthday. Bless me. God, I'll die! Sorry. Yo, Jeevika! Happy birthday. Thank you. By the way, sis, brother's room is that way. Nothing's gonna happen there. Make him also sleep between Mom and you! Go for it! What happened? Oh, Mom, are you hurt? What are you doing here? Gifting Kanika the bracelet you got for her on her birthday. Now, let's go. Let's go. I'll drop her. - Switch off the light. - Bye! Massage Mom's hands. Oh, this hurts! I don't need your help. Yes, Kanika. I'm telling you I can take care of myself. I want to do it. I want to take care of you. Oh, my... Hey. Jeevan, I'll take it from here. No, let me drop you in. Why? Because I'm a woman? No. And I have had too much to drink. I am drunk, I won't have control of my steps. I might fall down. I might create a ruckus. Not this time, dear. On this birthday... Loser Kanika won't cause any chaos. Loser Kanika? You are a legend for me, Kanika. You live the way you want to. I'll be right behind you. I won't let things get chaotic. Take care. Guard! Where will I find a cab from? - Yeah! - I won! Happy birthday. Happy birthday, girl! Where are you going? Come, join us. No need for formality, Uncle. It's 2:30 a.m. No cheating, Malhotra. I'll be right back. Come, Kanu! Dr. Malhotra just gets nervous sometimes. But how are you home so early? Why? Did I interrupt your play date? Don't be silly. But didn't you go out with that guy... What's his name? He's also Malhotra. - What's his name? - Arjun. Arjun! How was it with him? Not as romantic as your night. So sorry. For tonight, or for life? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, my baby doll! Thank you, Grandma. - Come with me. - Not now, Grandma. Come, I have a surprise for you. For my doll. Sit here. No. No, no, no. Your liver will rot. Say yes to Jeevan's marriage proposal. - What? - Yes. He is such a lovely boy. - Shit. - Dropped you here in your car, and poor fellow took a cab back home. Grandma, I forgot to file my taxes! You were supposed to remind me. Instead, you are stalking me through the window! I need to look out for you! This house is doomed. You are my responsibility, after all. Break it. Why is the Wi-Fi not working? Hear me out. If you get married this year, then maybe in two years you'll get pregnant. Thirty-three, thirty-four... She can get pregnant at 40 if she freezes her eggs. So will she push babies out of the fridge? When God has given her a first-class apparatus to make babies, why waste that blessing recklessly? What recklessness, Grandma? I'm just filing my tax certificate! What will you achieve by filing your tax certificate? File for a marriage certificate! Mom is single, Tina is divorced. Tina's husband cheated on her, Grandma! He had sex with someone else. Enough! Tell me something new. He is a man. He will be a man. We as women have to hold a marriage together. What soap opera is brainwashing you? Okay. Remember the time... when you carried a baby like an armor saying you were a revolutionary? Kept telling me that the world was changing. All bogus! The world will never change! Then "Femi-sanam..." Feminism. Whatever it is, that is what has brainwashed women! Any problem, Bina? You problem! - The Kapoor family's fate is the problem! - Kishori. - Kishori, please. - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - What's going on? - Your son is older than Kanika. You talk to me. Right? - Then why do you shamelessly come here? - You... - What the hell is going on? - Relax. - Every day is the same nuisance! - You... - Your boyfriend stinks of alcohol! - You do this every day! - Please! This can't be a daily drama! - Have a drink. Can I live my life? - This is not a pub, it's my house! - I did nothing wrong. - Stop it! - I'll do what I want. - I have a life! - What life? Hey, Kanu! Oh, Lord! There she screws up again. Kanika Kapoor is no more. Yes. Everyone is saying she was drunk and slipped off the staircase. So sad! But what was her problem? Kanika's problem was that she always played way outside her league. For instance, he would have said yes to her. Right? Or even these men. But to dream of me? Cute. Her problem was that she didn't know what she wanted. Local beer, or vintage wine. One night stand or lifelong comfort. Her problem was that she didn't want a boyfriend, she wanted a superhero. If she gets hurt, he should become her daddy. And if she cries, he should become her counselor. It's best for her that she died. She was alone anyway. Otherwise, she would have turned out like me. - Bimla! - Single till the end. Coming! Kanika's only problem was... that she didn't say yes to my proposal. Otherwise, her casket wouldn't be decorated with flowers... but with wedding jewelry. No, Son, don't cry. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Everyone here is giving her too much credit. I'll tell you what Kanika Kapoor's real problem was. She didn't know how to pleasure men. You know, she was vanilla in bed. These days women wear colorful ones. - Really? - Yeah, all lacy and frilly ones. But what color? Red. And blue. But for whom? And yellow for Mrs. Sharma. Grandma, am I losing my mind? It's not your fault. It's in our genes. Are the Kapoor women cursed? That we all will die single? There are no curses or miracles. We are given a choice every step of the way. Life shapes up based on the choices we make. Your mother also had a choice. But she trashed it. Now, it's your turn. I am a traveler on the road of love Yes, dear? Last night you were on a roll. Jeevan, it's a yes. When do we get engaged? You want to get married, right? Jeevan, are you crying? I would marry you right now. Like now. Now... Hell... Hello? Kanika? My doll! Thank you, God. Have you completely lost your mind? Wedding? That too with Jeevan? Why? What's the problem? He loves me. He respects me. I know he isn't as cool as us, so what? I'm a catch for him, so what? He's self-made and successful. He owns four shops. He'll keep me happy. Shops of hand showers! But at least a hand shower is better than a hand job. Virgin Kanika! Mean girls! We can never be equals! Mean girls! We can never be equals! Just kidding, babe. Saw your snaps last night on Instapix. Arjun Malhotra. Isn't he a little too young for you? Babe, you know Kanika's taste. Either a wheelchair or a pram. She's engaged. Yes. Kanu is sorted for life. - Sorted? - What? He's in retail. Hand... Hardware. Very rich. Old money and all. Old money? Yeah. I'm engaged. You guys must come for the engagement. It's a special invitation. So happy for you, babe. Really? Genuinely. After all, can't sit alone at home forever and be happy watching porn. Right. It's Rabeya's turn! Rabeya! Let's go. Come on. - I have a sprain! - Wait a sec. Excuse me. Excuse me. Rabeya! Rabeya! Hi! Your mom is too cute, yo! She's single. You wanna be my dad? - No. - Okay, Miss Wedding Planner, let's start planning for the D-day. I'll faint out of excitement! Fuck this shit, guys! Do I not have the right to celebrate something in life? On my birthday, I'm dreaming of my funeral. That's a fucking sad life! What do you want to celebrate? Death of your desires? Or a lifetime of vanilla in bed? - Excuse me? - What do you mean? Does marriage mean vanilla in bed? No and, one second. What are you trying to say? That Jeevan is impotent? Exactly. For all we know, he could be the don of sex. I think he is. Yeah, right. His name is Jeevan Anand. That's the name of an insurance policy! You both know that, right? And have you seen his face? He looks like a virgin! Can he even get it up? Well, if he can't, we'll get it up! Our actions will speak louder than words! Look, guys. Whatever it is, I don't want to die alone. Okay? Go, Rabeya! It's not that deep, bro! Women love to complicate their lives by over-analyzing. Oh! You all want a hot guy, but you also want depth in that relationship. Why suffer so much? It's just marriage. Don't overthink. Just do it. Watch TV together every day. Dinner dates on the weekends. Hopefully, you have sex every 10-15 days. And then every two or three months, off to a hill station. There's your happiness! If you want extra happiness, pop a beer during the day. Order a fancy meal. And there you go, happy, happy! These savings were for her food business. Now she wants to buy a bridal trousseau! So? Can't the plans change? This is a hasty decision. Maybe I should have gotten pregnant like you, too. Right? Be right back. Why would I have married your father? He didn't love me. He pitied me. Because I was pregnant with you. That marriage would have been a tick mark, that's it. And this seems no different. What's your problem, Mom? I am getting married out of my own will. You should be bloody happy for me, Mom. - Kanu... - No, you are the greatest. You are a revolutionary. You've scaled peaks. But I have not. This marriage will be a tick mark, right? I'm okay with a tick mark. Okay? Kanu! Save some money for yourself. You'll need it soon! Not everyone has this privilege, Kanu! Your beloved is here to wed you Come, Jeevan. - Say yes, and come along! - Mummy, my button... Oh! My heart sings Even if you cannot hear it Oh! I've stolen your heart And fled even if you're still to choose me Why am I inadequate, my love? I'm here to wed you I dream about you night and day Listen to me I cannot stop loving you I cannot stop listening to my heart I want to bequeath you my sweetest memories... It's a lonely road - The road of love. Will we unite? - Kanika? -It will be dawn once the night is gone -Smoke? What's it? Toys for the after-party! What is all this? It's the time to disco, baby! Well done. This rose is to misuse, seduce, and let out the juice! You guys are crazy. Oh! My heart sings Even if you cannot hear it Got a small instead of a medium, right? You're looking nice. Screw nice! I want to look like a catch! Steaming! Hot! People need to go crazy. Why are all women in denial, bro? Don't compare your waistline with anyone! But it is natural. That's not natural. Baby, your cholesterol level is not natural. Have some apples for once, man. Who eats healthy on a picnic? Okay then, I'm fasting for your long life, and you want to make me a widow. What do you mean widow? Why are you scolding me like our school principal? Do I ever say anything to you when you drink like a fish? Have I ever called you a drunkard? Do I ever call you out? I don't, right? Actually, you do you. No doctor can tell you better. I'm fed up of being told what to do! "Karan, do this. Karan, do that. Karan, sit there. Karan, sleep there. - Karan, don't wear this T-shirt." - Guys! I've been listening to you ever since we got married. I'm not a child! Your beloved is here to wed you Say yes, and come along! Oh! My heart sings Even if you cannot hear it Oh! I've stolen your heart And fled even if you're still to choose me I'll die. We were almost going to do it. Like, we made out and everything. Everything was going smoothly. And then, by mistake, I touched his crotch. I flipped out. The first time should be special. In the confusion of to-do or not-to-do, I made a funeral out of it! By the way, your boy Rohan, is he even a good kisser? It starts off well, and then it gets really sloppy. You also did it in high school, right? So what? No big deal. First love, true love, it's all bullshit, Rabeya! It was pointless of me to put pressure on my virginity. I think you're right. I am also putting a lot of pressure on my virginity! Excuse me! That's not what I'm saying. Boys are assholes, Rabeya. They fuck you up emotionally, and then you'll constantly doubt yourself... Look, what I am trying to say... is that don't pressurize yourself. Do it when you're ready. Let's go home now. Jeevan and his friends are coming home for dinner! Come on. Don't look there. - What are you looking at? - Don't look there. Dearest Brother-in-law! Your turn now. Come on. Come. - Go on. - Let's dance. KANIKA'S JEEVAN WELCOME TO THE ENGAGEMENT - Hello. How are you? - Welcome. Congratulations! My to-be son-in-law!

The decor, the glam! "I don't want commitment. I'm too cool!" Yeah, that thing people say, "Me and my solitude." That might be very tempting to other people. But solitude for me, really sucks! You don't need to explain anything to me. I get you, Kanika Kapoor. I get you. First, hear me out And hold your glass up I haven't come alone I've come with my girls But I am a little high right now And I slip when I hear you talk You've got a swagger in your walk You are conquering hearts along the way Toast to that Your bravado is attractive Let this moment not break Bring me closer to you Hold me tight DJ, let me hear you pull up Pull up, yeah!

But be careful, don't slip a disc again. Who will have your back now? If fate has it, someone will come by. Like you found someone. "Jee-won!" I wasn't looking for "someone". I was looking for "the one". This is for you. It's written by me. For you. Read it when you're alone. Hello. I am Kanika's plus one. You? I am her minus one. Professor. Oh!

Live long and prosper, my child. Punjabis rule the world! Are you freaking out? Obviously. Didn't you say it's just marriage? Don't overthink it. Just do it. Me? When? Forget it. Just drink your fears away! Rock it. Kanika looks like she's on cloud nine! Marriage is suiting her. When she was dating me, you must be worried, right? What's there to worry about? Everyone makes mistakes. Haven't we made enough? Thank you. You're right. Move past the old mistakes. Make new ones. Fresh ones. Hey! Still single? Always. And you? Always. By the way, what are you doing tomorrow? I want you to meet the ageless poet Gulzar. He's my buddy. Really? I love his poetry! I'll give you a call. Cheers! Why does everything feel so right today? So perfect. Maybe the drinks are kicking in. Or maybe I was never the problem. Maybe the problem was my idea of love. Maybe Prince Charming doesn't exist. I think Grandma is right. "We are given a choice every step of the way. Life shapes up based on the choices we make." Okay then, I've made my choice today. Screw these fairy tales. Burn the frog prince. From today, no more Loser Kanika. Only Mrs. Kanika Jeevan Anand. "Happily ever after" is a myth. Happy is good enough. Kanu, I can't handle it! We've become old! My head is exploding. Can't party like 16 anymore! I got it, Tina. My head is pounding. Tina, it happened. By the way, that babe Rushi, what a firecracker! She's so funny! I've never seen anyone burn the dance floor with such heavenly moves. I was like... I was in heaven, Tina! I finally had an orgasm! What! Sorry. I told you. I told you Jeevan is the don of sex. What position did you surrender in? The nation wants to know! I am not sure! Bro, did it happen once or multiple? And how long did he last? Did he cuddle you? Were my DVDs helpful? Cool. Did you use the condom or not? Or did you keep going in the spur of the moment? And hats off to Jeevan. Jeevan! - Who's the one? - Jeevan! - Who's the one? - Jeevan! I'm not sure, guys! I am not sure. Was it Jeevan, or... I am not sure. It has to be Jeevan. You were stuck to him like glue. I saw it. She was also glued to the Professor! And also with Arjun. Well, don't forget Rahul. And also with that sweet vendor. So what? With who? Well... Gopal! I wanna have some sugar! Gopal! Looks like Gopal got some sugar last night. Shut up! Idiot. She is a sucker for drama, and you are fueling the fire. Kanu, it has to be Jeevan! He took the room key from me last night. He indulged in pre-marital sex. Right? Jeevan has done what no one in your life could do. And instead of revering him, you are dismissing him. Heartless! You're right, I'm heartless. Yes. - I'm heartless. - Yeah. - It has to be Jeevan. - Yes. - Right? - Of course. Okay, let's go. Go where? - Come on. - But where? - Hurry! - Yeah, okay. - Yo, Jeevika. - Hey! Sister-in-law? So early in the morning? Where's my Jeevan? You aren't tired, I see. No, thanks. - I told you... - Hello, Auntie. Bless you and always be happy! You set the dance floor on fire last night. Auntie, where's Jeevan? - He's sleeping upstairs. - Okay. - Wait up. - Yes? Didn't you guys pull an all-nighter last night? Mom, it wasn't just a late-nighter, our prince came home early morning today! Good morning, dear. Good morning, dear. Jeevan... wake up. Okay. Good morning. - Kanika? - Jeevan. Now just concentrate on this, okay? I didn't register anything last night. Seems like you are still tipsy. Call me tipsy if you like, but I want to reach heaven again. So, let loose now. And let's loosen these clothes. Hold on, dear. Mom! Don't hold it in, Jeevan. You made me reach the closest to heaven. - Can't hold on now. - What happened? Oh, my God! Kanika! Kanika. Oh, my God! Kanika, yes! Thanks. It's the... first time we got this far, so... I couldn't control it. But what about last night? No... you were dropping hints all night. But then suddenly, you took the room key from me... and disappeared into the night. Are you upset with me? No, Jeevan. I have gotten so used to being naughty with you in my dreams. This was finally happening for real... and I couldn't hold back. Jeevan, can I give you a hug? Didn't ask for permission while being naughty. You are a cheater! I love you. What the hell is happening here? You've slept with someone else on your engagement night. So you're definitely not attracted to your fiance. - Then, why the drama? - Hold on a second. Men do it all the time. At their bachelor parties, they leave no stone unturned, and then they show up at their own wedding like nothing ever happened. It's a tradition. Our girl has lived up to it, that's it. Kanu, you've gotten engaged now, in your stubbornness. But why get married? You just want a tick mark, that's it. Isn't that the end goal? Yes, I want a tick mark. I want to get married, okay? I don't want to end up like Dr. Kapoor. I am not going to find a man better than Jeevan. Let's just accept it. I'm not letting go of him. Pass me that. But we have to solve this mystery. With Delhi aunties around, gossip will spread like wildfire. Trust me. Yeah, fine, I'm in. Make it or break it. Thanks. Find the hotel manager's number. Let's check the CCTV. And what will you say to him? "Groom and whom?" Guys, the man who has given the orgasm must have given a special gift, too. Let's open the gifts. Guys, Rahul. He's given a check. He's the best. Amount? Guys, one lakh. Bro, Arjun gave you a mixer grinder. But the most boring of all is the Professor. He's palmed off a book. Cheapskate! - This one's empty. Look at it. - So cheap! - Who gave this? - Some people just come to eat! Don't you remember my wedding? My heart longs for those moments When I just sit thinking of my beloved My heart longs for those moments When I just sit thinking of my beloved I get lost in her thoughts For hours together "It's enough for me. You wouldn't accept it, but you know that somewhere, something is still unresolved." Wow, Professor, so romantic. Read it till the end, my beloved. Had Gupta not popped up that day, then that engagement ring... would have been mine. Things can still change, Professor. Right? - Professor has rewritten history! - Now? But how did these feelings sprout back after so many years? When we were together, absolutely zilch! And now they're back? Guys, even Veer found Zara again after 14 years! Right? But Professor has a 30-year-old son! A hot son. Exactly! What will he call me? Mommy Junior? He's considered the king of songs. He's the ageless poet Gulzar. Now some classics written by him, and some songs in his own voice. My heart longs for those moments What if this is destiny? What if Professor Shekhar is your prince charming? Increase the volume for Mommy Junior! When I just sit thinking of my beloved I get lost in her thoughts For hours together My heart longs for those moments When I just sit thinking of my beloved My heart longs for those moments What should I say now? Exemplar, beautiful. I wish I could kiss you. Professor! Kanika Didi? Rushi? Oh, my darling! What a surprise! Didi! But... Same? Oh! I'm... - Well... - Oh! I'm... Fuck! I'm just so... I'm... - I'll be back. - Sorry! Kanika, give me a chance to explain. I thought at least you'd understand the pain of loneliness. What happened? Nothing. This is for you. - She forgot her book. - You keep both. Shall I serve lunch? And will the young girl also eat? Yes, she will also eat. Guys, it wasn't the Professor. - We know. - We know. How? Take a look. Come on, let's go to Gurgaon. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. I am unbelievable! What's this secret den where he asked us to meet? He's a total party animal, dude! I have come from An unknown land of secrets I bring stories of spring from there Don't touch me, stay away I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! Don't touch me, stay away I wish someone would come in my arms And take these secrets from me I wish someone could see through my eyes And understand these signs Don't touch me, stay away I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! Don't touch me, stay away I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! Yo, I came out to you last night. You were the one who said, "I accept you for who you are! No matter what." And then we were dancing on the table. "Ghungroo toot gaye." Kanika, you don't remember anything? Even today, memory loss after two drinks? Rahul. Anjali. All that I see happening with you... did it happen before me or after me? I think... I think during. - During! - Hey! Listen, we need to talk. - Sorry, I'm getting ready. - Yeah. I thought you'd figure it out. You'd leave me. But your self-doubt surpassed even my self-doubt. That means it wasn't you as well. Wasn't? But where? Last night... I did it with someone else. Did what? Sex. Shit, and you won't remember who. I think you need a shot, girl. Cheers! I love this track. Bro, how much time will you take? Can't you make one drink quickly? Kanika Didi? What are the chances? You are here as well. I'm happiness. I'm everywhere. Yes, babe! Isn't she a sweetheart? I just had to invite her. All the sexiest ladies in the house! - Look at her, not at me! - Yes. Cheers. What happened? Tell me. I ain't no sexy girl! Listen, I think you're one of the most gorgeous and sexiest women in the world! That's why you swung the other way completely? Listen, if you were not you, I wouldn't be me! Mumma! So grumpy! Last night, you were on a roll. You were glowing! - I was really off my rocker last night. - Yesterday... - Last night she slept with someone else. - Really? Come on. Why are you stressing? It's just sex. Nothing to kill yourself over! I know the timing is a bit off. No, bro! First time in my life, my timing was bang on. Not off at all! First time in my life... For the very first time, I got the timing right. What? Does that mean you... She won the gold medal. Finally, some idiot cracked it. Why didn't you ever say this before? How was I to know that you're also a sister? Hello, bitches! Let's go! Listen, why didn't you ever tell any of your boyfriends this? Who tells the boyfriend? And you know how boys are. They make everything about themselves. And it is, honey. These guys don't have a clue what to do. We sisters have to beg to be pleased. Just like this. Give me some fun, for heaven's sake! Let's go, bitches! So you're sure that Jeevan wasn't the one who "won"? Don't be sick! And that Professor! He fled leaving you alone on the hotel trolley to go and see Rushi! "Kanika Didi. I am happiness. I'm everywhere!" But who was the one who gave me this happiness? Arjun! - It wasn't Arjun! - How the fuck do you know? Trust me, I know. - No! - Yes. - No! - Yes. - No! - Yes! Yes. Arjun?! Fuck! What have you dumped in this? Anjali. I have one for you. I'm not gonna "drag" this. My sense of humor is too good. I should be a stand-up comedian. I want to see you at the wedding. You have to come. If I don't come, will you cancel it? Now that you have decided to live the lie, then live it happily. You aren't living your truth either! Correct. And I'm not proud of it. If I had the slightest option, I'd choose to be me... 24/7. You have a choice. That's why I want to slap some sense into you. Hey! Thank you for coming! Your turn to come now. Loser Kanika! We meet again. Listen, Neha... I'm begging you, please don't trouble me today. Why not today, bitch? Where was the after-party? Your friend Pallavi said room 602. Devyani and I came up. We kept knocking, kept knocking. Then we called Pallavi. She didn't answer. - Then? - We said, "Let's bounce, then." And then all of a sudden the room door opened. We said, "Fine, enjoy without us." You were really out there today! I just saw the professor running down the corridor. Today I can have fun. It's the last day. And that Weirdo Karan of yours, he was puking around the lift. And what exactly were you two doing inside? Fucking answer! Fucking answer! Pick up the goddamn phone, Pallavi. Fuck it! I can't do this. I just can't. I can't do this. No, no, no. Pallavi, listen. At last night's after-party, Tina and you were also there with Karan and me? Wasn't last night's after-party canceled? Fuck! Yes, Jeevan. The whole night was like a party, so I got confused. Did you call by mistake? No, I made a mistake. After this morning's episode, I tried calling you so many times. But didn't hear from you. No message, no forward. When have I ever sent you a forward? That's also true. I'm a little out of it right now. Please, can I call you later? Dear, listen, just check my display picture at least. Why? Karan sent it to me. You look so cute in this. And look at you digging your favorite pizza, I was the one who sent it. But... when did you both click this? And... whose shoes are you wearing, dear? Yeah, there we go! - Show me. - Wait. - Show me. - Wait... Such a good photo. It's crap, Karan. You're unbelievable! By the way, you know what they say about big feet! Pallavi must be milking it! But should I tell you something? Yeah? Pallavi and you, at the garden picnic, fought really badly. Like cats and dogs. Losers! What's going on? Your friend Pallavi has turned me into a project, for God's sake! "If you change this, you can do better." Is she my wife or a rehab? Even if I were thinner, it wouldn't matter to her. She's a psycho! But listen, please don't do all this after marriage. Don't try to fix Jeevan like a project. You must be crazy. How can I make Jeevan a project? I hope he makes me his project. What did they call me in school? First, virgin. Then, slut. Then, vanilla. To hell with that! First time in my life, I'm getting respect. First time. That's why we get along. I know we lost touch for a few years. But who are we? - Who? - Mediocre! Broken confidence. Yes. Yet both of us aim for the stars. Hoping that a superhero, a superheroine will come to rescue us. Correct! Losers. Correct. Now, ask me, who is Kanika Kapoor? Who is Kanika Kapoor? You are a strong woman. - I'm a strong woman? - Of course. - Hearty! - You must be joking. Funny! You are a little sexy as well. Are you hitting on me? You said it's your last day today, so just trying... Humpty Dumpty! Don't eat that. - But where are you off to? - Shit! Had a great fall? Look at her eyes! She must be drunk! Call the cops! I'll file a drink-and-drive case against this woman! Just calm down. - Isn't it a cruel joke? - Spare her. Let's settle this. Try to understand. -For years, I walked alone, safely -Is this her bag? -I want to be yours -You're a smart man. Please leave. Till I keep breathing Just yours This is not me Believe me Look I'm laughing at myself as well! You laugh too At me I want to keep tripping Lose myself, forget myself This is not for me, Jeevan. Isn't it a cruel joke? Jeevan, tea? You have done nothing wrong. You are a good man. A very good soul, but... I am not good for you. Do whatever you feel like. You can curse me as much as you like. But I promise that after two years, you'll be thanking me. You won't find happiness with me. I am happy even now! What's the problem with me? I own a first-class business, I own a house, I have a loving family. I may not have those chiseled features, but I have a strong personality. I'll find someone. Because of you, I said no to six other marriage proposals. The question is... what will you do? Isn't it a cruel joke? For years, I walked alone, safely Isn't it a cruel joke? Are you mimicking me? Or genuinely tripping too? I can't believe this is happening Next station, Subhash Nagar. Yeah, Rabeya? Auntie... Rabeya, are you crying? Hello? Rabeya? Hello... Rabeya, what's up? Check your phone. Rabeya? That asshole... he leaked it. I'm getting broadcasted. Baby... Rabeya, don't worry about it. He made a foolproof plan. He chose the fucking timing. I have to give a graduation speech today. I'm getting the Board topper certificate today. Mamma's saying she doesn't want to see my face. I'm on fucking memes. I've gone viral. Rabeya, don't lose hope. We will fix everything. Just don't cry. Rabeya, you're a strong girl. You have to be strong. You're a strong girl. Okay, Rabeya? Everyone is calling me "Slutty Rabeya". Tell us, how was Kanika in bed? She ain't no fireworks for sure. - She's a loser. - Why? She is bland. Touch her anywhere, she just lies there like a corpse. "I won't do that, I won't do this." She is a defective piece. I swear, she's a bore. - Is she that type of girl? - A lesbian? Don't mind, but how did you not figure it out? I mean she had a mustache since kindergarten. So... My heart screams in pain But is there anyone who can hear it? No matter how much I try I only get tears in return There's only one face I see in front of my eyes Of my shattered self There's only one face I see in front of my eyes I wonder why life is so painful Why can't passing time be frozen Just for a moment? It's inevitable What's lost will never come back You slept with my husband! I have just seen you ruin it all! - From the Hotel CCTV. - Pallavi! - What is this behavior? - You fucking bitch! - How dare you! - Leave her. What is this rowdy behavior, Pallavi? I learned it from your daughter. What's the matter? That's why you didn't want us to check the CCTV footage, Loser Kanika! No, Pallavi. There must be some misunderstanding, Pallavi. I have been misunderstanding it all this while. Twenty-five years of friendship was my misunderstanding. Pallavi, please! - Listen... - What did they say in school? Don't say that, please. That Kanika ain't built for relationships. It's not in her! They were right! I had one wholesome relationship, my marriage. I was holding it tight, I wasn't letting it break! No, Pallavi. I am sorry. Just stop touching me! You disgust me! Pallavi, try and understand. How dare you... give my daughter, Rabeya, advice! You've done nothing good with your own life. Why are you messing up my daughter's life? Rabeya has done no wrong. Wrong has happened to her. She needs us! Auntie, shut up! You should be the last one to lecture... on morality. It feels like a joke! No matter how hard one tries... to be both, a father and a mother, to raise a child, give them a normal life. To keep them away from one's own mistakes. But some asshole always comes around to take a piss on the efforts, right? Don't say that, Tina. You've raised a solid girl! I've fucked her up, Dr. Kapoor. Just like you! Today is her graduation speech. Instead, she's going to give an apology speech! - And it's all because of you! - Stop it! How dare you touch her? Get out of here. Get out of my house! Out right away! Rabeya needs us. Why don't you all just mind your own business? - Are you okay? - Kanu! Shameless mother! Shameless daughter! That's also my fault, right? You don't want to take any responsibility! "Kanu, is your mother unmarried? You are a bastard child. Filthy!" No... "Vanilla in bed. Touch her anywhere. She just lies there like a corpse. Kanu, you've never had an orgasm? Shit. What a feeling." I should have given up a long time ago. In this abnormal family, how can anyone be normal? What is normal? Seventy percent of women in the world have never had an orgasm in their whole lives. Because 90% of the men don't know how to do it. That's why I tell my patients, "Do it yourself", it is the key to happiness. If this were a man's problem, then it would be breaking news. There would be protests on the streets. So many movies would have been made on the issue. But we are women! Women can't make demands. They are the epitome of sacrifice! Their sole purpose is to make others happy. And, honestly, our wiring isn't simple either. When there is no pleasure here and here, then how will we find pleasure there? The three are connected. Yes, but you can't find this pleasure with your best friend's husband, Dr. Kapoor! I am a defective piece! Your daughter is cursed. Careful. Cursed? I thought so, too. Everyone was so disappointed with me... when I decided that you would be in my life. Not your biological father! Kanu, I was terrified. I thought maybe society was right, and I was wrong. I started to doubt myself. But, like how you don't want to be like your mother, I didn't want to be like my mother. I wanted to live my life on my own terms. Even if the whole world was cursing me. They must be cursing me too, now. Maybe. But everyone's happiness is not our problem. Only our happiness is. It's our right! We won't make do with this "tick mark life". Neither for me nor for my daughter. There's no reason to be sorry. Because where there is shame and guilt, happiness can never find its way. Are you happy now? I am. Look at yourself. You're intelligent. You're independent. You are a little funny, too. And until sometime back, you had the best of friends who would die for you. You've fought for 30 years for your fairy tale. So I guess, I must have done something right. But this time, I've messed up big time. And only you can fix it. Every action has its consequences. Easy! It's hurting. Kanu. You remember in sixth grade, you got an anonymous Valentine's card in your room? Obviously, Mom. It was the only one I got in life. Karan gave it. What? He came home to leave it in your room. He told me not to tell you. And then you found Bunny. And he got close to Pallavi. And life just happened. But you know, it used to happen a lot in those melodramas, "My journey has led me to you." Sounds cheap... but it's true. When there is something unresolved between two people, the feelings can resurface. If this was a melodrama, then you would be pregnant tomorrow. What an after-party! With you, my whole life feels like a party! Thrilling, electrifying, amazing party. And we all are... side dancers. And you, center stage. Center stage? Center stage? I'm center stage. You're a champion! Diva. Seductive. Steaming! Foxy. I'm the star! I'm the heroine! Center stage. Main lead. Heroine. I have come from An unknown land of secrets I bring stories of spring from there Don't touch me, stay away I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! Don't touch me I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! I'm a fairy! Mom! What were you two... You said, "Do it yourself" is the key to happiness. - I did it! - What? - I did it! Grandma, I did it! - What... What happened? My journey has led me to my own self! Thank you! It wasn't Karan. What is she babbling? Thank you for coming, Kanika. Where are you running like a lunatic? - Yes! - Have you gone mad? Stop! At least call Jeevan! - Grandma! - Hey! We've paid the wedding caterer for 250 people already! Everyone has received the wedding invite as well! For once, do the right thing! That's what I'm going to do, Grandma! First time in my life, I am going to do the right thing. Hold on! She left. Kishori. What did you mother-daughter talk about? Say something. What bullshit is it this time? You both have gone crazy! I am going back to Punjab. Get my tickets done! - Wait, hear me out. - I'm leaving. Kanika! I've been trying to reach you for so long! My wife has gone Tarzan on me. And don't believe her, nothing happened. Obviously, nothing happened. How can anything happen? Why not? We had a real vibe. After I left, who went into the room? And we are extremely ashamed. And don't want to point fingers or blame anyone. But both parties have to take equal responsibility. From our end, Rohan Khurana stands suspended. By her choice, our head girl and school topper would like to say a few words. Rabeya Das. Respected teachers, dear friends, dearest mother, - I'm so... - Rabeya! Auntie. No, no, no! - Just shut up! - Auntie! Isn't that Kanika Kapoor? What is she doing here? Respected teachers, students, parents, I am Kanika Kapoor from class... No, I'm not from any class obviously. I'm an alumna of this school and... and today after 17 years, I have set foot in this auditorium to say what Rabeya Das isn't able to say. To hell with you all. Kanu, stop it! Why should she say sorry? Will you all forget if she says sorry? You didn't forget my episode! Asked a question, say sorry. Gave an answer, say sorry. Caught with a boyfriend, say sorry. Broke up with a boyfriend, say sorry. Hooked up, be sorry. Didn't enjoy the hookup, be more sorry. Kick her out! A woman has to apologize more than a man in prison. Why does a strong woman threaten you? If she lives on her terms, what's your problem? We deserve happiness. I deserve happiness. I'll be shameless and I'll grab my happiness. Boys and girls have sex. Hi, Neha Oberoi. My mother and I are single, and I am not ashamed of it! I'm fine with it, babe. And you three, uncles of the first order! I had this feeling about the three of you. That soon you'll match each other's receding hairline. Amaan Singh, Nikhil Mittal, and your Mr. Universe... Bunny Bhatia. You are God's gift to mankind! You are an asshole. And I am Loser Kanika, and I am not ashamed of it. I am not ashamed! That's why you slept with my husband! Pallavi, just sit down! Don't be silly! He is a friend. He was there only for ten minutes! - Ten minutes is more than enough for him! - Shut up! Pallavi, just stop it! Sit! Please stop it. They will cancel her college scholarship. How can they do that, Tina? Look at your daughter. She's an honors student, the head girl. Cambridge has offered her a scholarship. One day, she'll be giving out jobs to these losers! You're a champion, Rabeya Das. You're sensitive, loving, respectful, non-judgmental. This is who you are, Rabeya. Not the silly mistake you made. You know what? We all make silly mistakes. You're right, Auntie. I am not ashamed of this video. - Rabeya! - I did nothing wrong in it. Come back down! - Please! - Rabeya! But all those who helped spread this video, you all should be ashamed. Rabeya, don't. It was an honest moment of love. - Rabeya... - No, Rabeya! - Rabeya Das! - Rabeya! - Kanu, please! - Security! I don't want to say sorry! I don't want to become thin! I don't want to wear a bra! I don't want to believe in traditional values! I don't want to get my eyebrows done! I don't want to study math! Smash patriarchy! Smash patriarchy! Smash patriarchy! Smash patriarchy! Smash patriarchy! Rabeya, stop. Rabeya, come down! - Come. - Stay away! Back off. This journey continues beyond the sky The threads of the world cannot stop it The ones that had stopped Are now running as dreams Where will they halt now? Life, the one that we've touched Even our nature has a new color Neither do we know ourselves Nor anyone else So live for today Is there any more of it? You both are super brave, Tina! Grandma, the most! What happened? There are new moments... New conversations, new days! Everything has changed Kanu, if I had married your biological father, then our surname would have been Singhal. That means our status would be in our name! No way. Yes, that's a fact. Kanika Kapoor Singhal. Grandma, it's funny! - You can laugh! - Laugh. Grandma! What is happiness? It is not some secret that you unlock. It's a choice. Every second of every day. And if you haven't followed the story up until now, just know that... "Happily ever after" is for you when you're with you. So the forward of my story will be, "Once upon a time, Kanika Kapoor met Kanika Kapoor. And they lived happily ever after."
