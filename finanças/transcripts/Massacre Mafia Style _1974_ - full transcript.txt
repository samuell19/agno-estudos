Send them right in. - Hello, Al. - Mimi, what the fuck you want me to do? - It's not what you're gonna do, it's what we're here to do, Al. - Hey, are you crazy or something? - Shut up, just shut up. - [Al] What are you doing? What's wrong with you? - Get his hands. Come on, wheel the motherfucker out. In here.

My wife, who passed on two years later, of incurable cancer. A woman of simple Italian heritage, a saint. A woman of fear of the man she loved and of the child who might follow in his footsteps some day. And of course, La Patron, my father. Deported from the United States, took me with him, putting me in exile at the age of 15 for no reason. Just for what he had done against the American laws. This man could call the shots, Don Mimi, La Patron, lord of organized crime. This was my father, my intended life. No way would I accept this, no way. - Don't you understand? The law doesn't take anything useless. You cannot buy the police in Los Angeles. Therefore, no money can be made. Stay here, where you belong, with Mimi and I. - Papa, listen to me. 16 years ago you were exiled out of New York. I'm stuck here with a six-year-old kid and a dead wife. I'm an exile, too, Pop. I'm not gonna play with the law in Los Angeles, Pop. I want the pimps and I want the bookmakers. - A man has to do what he has to do. You have had warnings. Speak on it with your eyes, your mouth, not your hand, your heart. - Si Papa, si. (gently dramatic music) Here, come here, sit down, buddy. I gotta talk to you. You know why? Because Daddy's going to Los Angeles. That's where they make all those motion pictures. And I'm gonna make you a movie star, all right? Then I'm going to New York. I'm gonna bring you back a whole load of toys. All I want you to do is listen to Grandpa. And I want you to listen to Bumpus. He'll take care of you, you understand. Bye-bye, kiss. - Bye. - Another one. (speaking in a foreign language) Bye. (uplifting music) Los Angeles. I knew only one person in this beautiful town. A kid I grew up with before my father and I were deported. His name, Jolly. And he lived up to that name. When we were kids, we spoke of nothing but Hollywood. And you know how Hollywood is to kids. Especially bust-out little New York kids. I searched everywhere for him. I knew he'd be in some joint. I knew he had guts. Because his father worked for my father, he was my old man's right arm in the old days. If I could convince him, we would be a small army of guts, balls, and trust invading Hollywood. - Yes sir, what's it gonna be? - What's it gonna be? You silly bastard, don't you recognize anybody? - Mimi, Mimi, this is you. You remember that, yeah, chief. Yeah, it's good to see you. - Listen, I'll tell you what we do. Okay, why don't you give everybody a drink, get yourself another bartender, I'll meet you over there in the corner and we'll talk some. - You got it. - Hey, that's my friend Mimi, he's buying you a drink. Hey Mimi, Mimi, you're still drinking two vodka, right? - Not all the time. - Hey, is it really you? Jesus, I can't believe it's really you. Let me look. Eh, you look the same. In fact, you probably look a couple years younger. - What are you doing, you freeing niggers with this beard? - That's Hollywood, baby, that's what they do out here. It's good to see you, really. - You don't know how long I've been looking for you. I went from joint to joint looking for you. I don't know, I must've hit 50 joints looking for you. - Here I am, in a bar, right here, man. You know how many times I thought about you? - What happened to your old man? - You know, right after your father got deported, everything got really hot and heavy. Mimi, you don't know. You know, right after that, all that happened, the organization sent some guys after him and they gave him a choice to make. Either take a phony extortion rap or wind up in a pine box. And he took the phony extortion rap, just to save my ass. I was only 16, you remember. And you know what, he took the rap. He wound up in the slammer and he died anyway. He wound up in a pine box. We really suffered, we really did. - We suffer. We don't suffer killing. We just got the good end of it. When my old man came to this country, many, many years ago, did you ever know that my old man was a glassblower? - No, I didn't know that. - He was an artist. He made beautiful vases, stemware glass, beautiful things, he was an artist. And when he came to this country, got off that boat on Ellis Island, there was a big Irish cop standing on the corner. Soon as he got off, he says, "What's your name?" He says, "Domenico Salvadore Miceli." You know how the old man used to talk. And they said, "What?" And he couldn't spell it, so he says, "From here on in, your name is Dominic Mitchell." Then he handed him fucking fish. He sent him on a corner to sell a fucking fish. The old man had to eat. So he went and he sold the fish. When he got to the corner, there was another guy on the corner. Took out a pipe and broke his head. The old man got well, went to the next corner. That guy broke his head. And the next guy broke his head. And the next guy broke his head. Finally, the old man couldn't take it anymore. So he went and he found three or four St. Juliana friends. He says, "You come with me." He says, "Because I gotta work one of these corners. "I gotta sell that fucking fish." He says, "And as soon as they come after me," he says, "I'm gonna take this bat "and I'm gonna break their fucking heads." And they went. And they broke that guy's head and that guy's head and that guy's until they controlled every fucking fish that came off that boat. Every boat, every guy that stood on every corner, and including that fucking cop they bought, who sold them that first fish. - We suffered a lot, though. - That's it, my man. (speaking in a foreign language) - Jolly, I need you. - Hey, I'm here, you got me. - Tell the owner of this toilet to stick it up his ass. - Hey, it'll be a pleasure, believe me. - We got a lot of things to do. I guarantee you in two or three years, I'll give you a piece of Hollywood like you never seen in your life. - Hey count me in, I'm in. - You know Chucky Tripoli? - Sure I know Chucky Tripoli. He used to be your father's lieutenant. He's number one now, he came out of retirement. - Well, we're gonna snatch him. - What? Chucky Tripoli's number one, Mimi. - [Mimi] In church, on Sunday, going in a fucking collection or something, we're gonna snatch him. - [Jolly] I know the church he goes to. - [Mimi] So do I. - [Jolly] Oh, you've been doing your homework. - [Mimi] We're gonna nail him. - [Jolly] Okay. (speaking in a foreign language) (powerful church organ music) (suspenseful music) (doorbell ringing) - Yes? - Hi, I've got a package here for Mr. Marco Tripoli. - I'm Marco Tripoli. - Marco Tripoli, I have a package for you. Sign right here, please. There you are. - There you go. - Hello Ann, have you seen Chucky? No, he hasn't been home all night. I'm really worried. No, he didn't even call. He left the church with some guys. - Ma! - What is it, Marco? (dramatic music) (knocking) (suspenseful music) - Francesco Cheech Tromboli, born Naples, Italy 1923. Pietro Allessi, also known to be serving under Dominic Zantelli in the Sons of Sicily Defense League as vice-president. Albert Mark Lowenstein, attorney at law. Herman the Jew Moscowitz. Georgios the Greek Angelopoulos. Soon to be dickering for control of narcotics market. Michael John Quinn, number 3950914. Dominic Zantelli, currently under investigation by the FBI for his alleged connection with the organization known as the Sons of Sicily Defense League. Vincenzio Bicarri, also known as Meatball. - $250,000, or we send the arm next. - What's this all about, anyhow? Why, why all this inconvenience? We're legit now, aren't we? - Listen, I called Cleveland, Miami, and New York. Not a smell. It must be a bunch of two-bedders. - Two bedders, for Christ's sake, they're hitting us for a quarter of a mil. - What are we jerking off for? Let's pay them the dough. - Hey, you must be getting soft, Zantelli. We gonna let a couple of deadheads muscle us? Besides, we don't even know that's Chucky's finger. - That's his finger, all right. I've seen it on him a million times. - Holy Jesus, what's with you guys? We sit here arguing while those gunners out there are ready to cut him to pieces. I'm with Zantelli, we pay them the dough. - Look, I learned a long time ago, the one time you whip a school bully is the first day of school. We let these guys muscle us now, there ain't gonna be any backing out, ever. - Main thing, let's get Chucky back. He'll tell us something. - Now wait a minute-- - Now listen-- (men talking over each other) - The first time you whip a school bully-- - All right! I don't want anymore lip from you, Biccari. Chucky out there could be any one of us. Any one of us. And if we don't take care of him, this organization ain't worth a fuck. (dramatic music) - Read the instructions, Marco. - [Marco] Put the money in a brown paper bag and deliver it to the spot that's mated on the note. And we'll have him back in time for your wedding. Or, we send him back in pieces. (upbeat music) - Hey Chucky, just like the old times. - Why not, the old traditions are the best. My son, God bless him, he deserves the best. Salud. (upbeat music) - [Liz] What does it mean? - The bread? It's tradition. One of the oldest traditions we have. And respect, the son shows respect for the father and the father gets the first slice. - That's beautiful. - Then after the respect, before the occasion, regardless of what it may be, a birthday, a wedding, the son puts his hand on the loaf of bread and pulls out a gift.

No, no there'll be a massacre here. (speaking in a foreign language) - I come direct from Palermo, Sicily. But my father, Dominico Salvadore Miceli sent me to give his heartfelt congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lorenzo Tripoli. And to these beautiful children may I say, (speaking in a foreign language) which means may it be 100 years. May I? Cheers. Cheech. - Mimi, I thought it was you. - How are you? - Great to see you. - Hey, how's everything? - Fine, fine, - How are the boys? - Oh you know, the one I put through college. And the other I had to put through the war. - I know, I know. Hello, Chucky. - Hello, Mimi. Mimi, say hello to Liz. - Hello, Liz. - Hello, Mimi. - [Mimi] I brought a little booster for the kids. - You son of a bitch. - But look you lose a finger, but you gain a right arm. - Mimi, let me tell you something. You'd be on the distaste list right now if it wasn't for your father Don Miceli. I owe everything to him. - [Mimi] Now I owe everything to you. - I'll forget this. - Chucky there's no reason for people like me and anymore, you know, it's all over. - Mimi, you can't start up the old stuff again. Let the bones lay where they are. These cops, they're not in line around here. You gotta go from pill joint to pill joint. Mimi, do me a favor, leave Los Angeles. Leave the raw stuff. - Listen, your percentages are there, you understand me? All I want are those black pimps and the bookmakers. - [Chucky] Mimi, why me, why me now? - Chucky, I want the pimps and I want the bookmakers. It's simple, do you understand me? Everything's okay. - Come on, enough of this talking. Aren't you gonna dance with your daughter-in-law? - Yeah, yeah. Hey, where are you staying tonight? With her? - [Chucky] Salud. - What about it? - What about what? - You putting me up for a couple of weeks. - A couple of weeks? - I ain't too much for a one-night stand. - I bet you aren't. - I'm hip. - Are you crazy? - Mimi, I'm Vince Baccari. I wanted to personally say hello to you and welcome you. Your father was a big help to me, I respect him always. - Yeah, well, lots of luck, I'll see you later. Okay?

This is one lady that doesn't take too kindly to men. I lay them, but I don't love them. You I could like. - And I like you, too. What have you got for dessert? (singing in foreign language) - Hey sweetheart, you go with the Greek, huh? - Some other time, Mister, I'm with someone. - No man, she's with me. - Hey, who you gonna go with? - Look Mister, I don't want any problems. I'm with him. - Well, he's nor gonna look so pretty good when I get through with him. - Hey look, honky, you better know what to do with that bottle. - Hey come on, Greek, there's plenty of broads here. - You're lucky, man, you're sure lucky. - Hey, ain't you got enough problems just being a spook? - Hey look, Jolly, I know you as a bartender. Don't know what you do now. But I'm still a pimp, man, and nobody fucks with my broads. Especially my old lady. - Hey, take your fucking Aunt Jemima and get her out of here. - Come on, mothers, I'll cut your fucking hearts out. - Hey, Super Spook, don't you know where you're heading? I'm gonna take this piece of a shell up your ass and I'll blow the top of your head off. - I don't know who you are, man, but I sure gonna remember you. - Hey, take a good look at me. Anybody can carry this piece. It takes a man to use it. - Okay, man. - Bartender, two-tone. - Hey, what are we gonna do, let the both of them go? - Hey Greek, why don't you have a good time? You got a hot all blistered soul. We'll straighten it out later, okay? - Hey Georgio, Mimi wants to handle it, let him handle it. There's enough for all of us. (men laughing) - You want one? - No. - Come on. - No, no, no. - Hey Mimi, tell me something. You're hitting the old bookmakers and pimps. That woman and King Kong that just walked out of here is the biggest pimp in LA. He's got 40 white girls working for him at $500 a day apiece. Don't we want him? - What are you worried about? Tonight we eat, tomorrow we shoot. (gunshots firing) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - Can't keep killing each other off. - Chucky cannot handle them. They're going crazy. Your Greek is pushing dope. I let you sell memberships to an organization that's under their controls. They call the Sons of Sicily Defense League. - They gotta make a buck, too, Mimi. - Yeah, but not at my expenses. If we are going to represent Sicilian people, we get a Sicilian lawyer, or a Sicilian Congressman. Not Chucky's man. Unless he's got a record from here to the wall. It is Zantelli people that puts a hit on Sicilian people. Legitimate people. And it all comes back to me. And the Greek is fucking around with dope. We never wanted dope. I never want to touch dope. I told the Greek to stay away from it, he won't listen. All right, Chucky gets an order, eliminates the Greek. And if that doesn't shake up Zantelli, Chucky gets another contract. - Okay, I'll call tonight. (speaking in a foreign language) (dog barking) - [Chucky] Every time he comes he brings that dog. - Hey Chucky, what are you gonna do, the guy's got three loves. His first love is the dog. Second love is eating. The third love is me, cut his arms and legs off for me. - Aw, he's nuts. - [Mimi] Hey what are those kids here for? - Little Jewish kids that live next door. They like to use the pool. - Hey, what's your name? (speaking in a foreign language) Get out of here. She's Jewish? - Mimi, I hate that dog. Every time he comes here, he craps, he pisses all over the lawn, I gotta clean it up. I'm gonna go check the food inside, I'm hungry. Jolly, don't take that frigging dog in the house! - He's a card. Tell me, Mimi have you heard from your father lately? - No, not lately, no. - Look at those kids. They're really having a ball. That reminds me, how old is your son now? - He's 17, big as you are. He's going to school in Milano. - Gee, you know, I miss the old country. One of these days I have to go back. I'm getting tired of all of this crap. Maybe I'll go back and join your father and him and I can plant tomatoes in Palermo. - Come on, you're getting maudlin. It's Palm Sunday. She's been cooking up a storm. I'm starving. Hey Jolly, come on, let's go eat. (happy music) - Listen, as long as I'm going, I wanna check on Jocko. Let me take this back in to Fanny, all right? - Here, take this with you, too, huh? - Okay. - Hey, have a little more wine. Come on, okay Mom. - You know, it's a funny thing to me, about the Italians. All they want to do is to eat, drink, be happy. What do we get? Disgraced. - You know, Chucky, the Italian hasn't been disgraced. You and I disgraced it. This old woman here is the one who's been disgraced. She's the one that's been taking the punches. She's the one who was handed the organ grinder and the monkey when she got off the boat. See these hands? You know what they smell of? (speaking in a foreign language) Beautiful herbs. They gave you mostaccioli, lasagna, pizza, the most appreciated foods in the world. What did we give her, Chucky? We gave her violence. We gave her death. We gave her dishonor. We gave these hands the ability to follow the Rosary beads and pray for us while we're in jail, facing the electric chair. These hands praying for me and you, kissing the cross for us before the guy pulls the switch. They've been called a wop, a dago, the old guinea. The one with the bun on the back of her head with the knitting needles in it, the knots in her stockings. Because to me she's as pure as the homemade wines she makes, the cookies she bakes. She's as powerful as the atomic bomb that Fermi invented, her son. I love her, Chucky. And someday we'll forget that she is violence Cosa Nostra. That ugly name we gave her, mafia. So every time you see her, beware of this woman. We'll come up to you and she'll ask, "Did you eat? "Have some more." That's all she wants. I love her. I love her. - In many ways, you are like your father, Mimi. Your words are his words. (speaking in a foreign language) Your strength is his strength. (dramatic music) - Cheech, go get the bread. - Okay, Chucky. - Mama, please, excuse us, we have to talk business. - All right. (speaking in a foreign language) - Sit here, Kelly. - Yeah, Chuck? - What is this? - The bread is from me. The money's from your father. You understanding me? - I understand. - Don Mimi wanted to hire a couple of guns out of New York. I got the best right here. - Why Jolly and me? - Mimi, you're in or you're in the way. - Here (speaking in a foreign language) Who is it? - The Greek. - Good, I always wanted to nail that son of a bitch. - [Chucky] Mimi, do you want to do this? - No, not necessarily. Chucky, you realize something that Jolly here is a (speaking in a foreign language), Lowenstein is a Jew, Marcowitz is a Jew, and Zantelli, he's a hard-headed Calabrese? And you and I are, and my old man, are the only Sicilians. Every time you see the word Sicily, the next word is Mafia. We take the raps. Not the Jews, not the Greeks, not the Calabrese or the (speaking in a foreign language). So if I'm gonna be known as a killer, I'm gonna show you how to kill. - One problem, Mimi, the Greeks and Al Lowenstein. They're partners. - Is he a Sicilian? - Hey Mimi, been a long time... What can I do for you, why are you here? - We're here to kill you. - You gotta be kidding. - Have I ever lied to you before? - You guys come from Sicily and think you're living in the old days. Your father called the shots a long time ago, Mimi. Well, he don't call them with me. Maybe he calls them in New York or Chicago, but no here. I no afraid of you, your father, or anyone connected with your family. Those days are gone. It's a brand new world. We do things differently today. - You know what you did, Greek? You captured the whole Mexican line. You let those guys out of New York right out of the box. Where you used to go directly to New York, you created your own river right into Los Angeles. I think you and Lowenstein would have drowned in your own river. - You know what I'm gonna do Mimi, I'm gonna have you thrown out of this office in a new way. Being the girlish snappers you are, I think you'll appreciate this. Aki, do your number on the coffee table please. (yelling) Now Aki, do your number on them. (dramatic music) (gunshots firing) - You know, I'm empty you got any? - I got two. - Give them to him. (gunshots firing) Come on, Jolly. Did you see the hits on the Jap? - Massive, come on. - [Bones] You gave the order, Chucky had it carried out. - Mimi, my Mimi? He won't kill a cockroach. - Oh no, what do you think he's been doing all of these years, studying to be a brain surgeon? - He was a gentle child. He never could stand the sight of blood. When I kill a chicken, he ran. - He watched, he learned, like father, like son. - I never want it that way. Mimi, a hijack man? - We've got our problems. Zantelli's partner Allessi, we told him to stop with the Sons of Sicily. - No killings, it's got to stop. It's got to stop! We can't afford to have the other family think we've been killing each other off. They just sit back and wait to take over. And they say you're not supposed to make no speeches. Not supposed to represent Sicilian people. Bones, you go to Los Angeles. Tell them there is no speech. And tell Mimi no more killings. (applauding) - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Our first guest this evening is Mr. Pietro Allessi. Good evening. - Evening. - Would you like to have a seat? - Thank you. - Mr. Allessi is a vice-president of a new organization called the Sons of Sicily Defense League. I've never heard of that organization, Mr. Allessi, but there's our camera. We have 11 million viewers out there that would also be very interested to find out a little bit more about it. So, why don't you clue us in. - Will do Well Barry, it's ridiculous what the public is doing to the Italian people. Especially the Sicilians. We, being a small part of the Italian people, a body of people made up of Sicilians are starting to resent the words Cosa Nostra, modernization, and that ugly word Mafia. Our organization, the Sons of Sicily Defense League, is going to try to stop the Sicilian people from being called organizers-- (gunshots firing) (people screaming) - You were told and he was told, no more TV and no more speeches. - What gave Mimi the right to kill him? - I swear by every saint I knew nothing of it. But if Mimi did it, he'll pay for it. - We're not killers. We don't bring in outside people. All we want is Mimi off our back. - Well, it's in respect to his father Don Mimi we let him live. But he's gotta stop bothering the bookmakers and the pimps and stop using his father as a shield. - That we guarantee, providing he lives. And providing Zantelli has nothing to do with the Sons of Sicily Defense League. - No trouble here, as long as you get Mimi to understand. (doorbell ringing) - That's Mimi now. Leave me alone with him. You guys get outta here. Come on. (suspenseful music) Not you, Jolly, I want to talk to Mimi alone. - Hello, Bones. - This is from your father. And this is from your son. And this is from the Holy Ghost. And no more of you taking Jolly, Cosa, or your father's words. I'm gonna give you $50,000 and you better get a legitimate business. And if you don't, it's your ass, you understand? - Bones, I love you Bones. - Mimi, wipe your tears and wipe your blood. You eat at my house and you drink at my house and then you murder my friends. - Fanny, you're in or you're in the way. (sunny happy music) - Gee, I wish I could water ski like that. - You get panicky when you take a shampoo. - Hey, when's El Putzo gonna get through with all that water skiing? - Hey, we got 20 G's invested in El Putzo out there making this movie. - Well, good to shoot the putz, what do we know about making movies? - He does. Besides, we're playing it straight up now. We is legit. - Oh, it's easy for you to say we is legit. But are making poor little movies legit? - Everybody does. - Hey, you know, you'd be great in this movie. All action, you never get off your ass. (speaking in a foreign language) - What are you gonna call the picture? - I think I'll call it Deep Thought. It's about two guys who get together and give each other great mind. (laughing) That's right. (boat engine racing) (happy music) You really know what you're doing with that water skiing bit, don't you, Mark? - Sure, Mimi, it's my whole life. First thing out of the office, right here. I sleep, screw, and swim all on this boat. - Got a spot for Liz in this show? - Sure, it pays $100 a day and all-you-can-eat. - No thank you, I'll just watch. - Okay, I'm gonna get everything going. We're gonna finish up here today. - Where are we shooting next, Mark? - Lower deck, cabin scene, come on down. - Yeah okay, I'll be down. - Okay everybody, let's finish up, cabin scene, come on. Lower deck. (happy music) (speaking in a foreign language) - Jesus Christ, it's cold. - Come on, come on Mimi, let's get out of here. What are we doing? We got more important things to do. we gotta go mail that Tutula pimp, Super Spook. - Would you take your time? Don't put this porno business down. That guy downstairs is making a lot of bread with this kind of money. You know what happened with Big Red in Miami? - Big Red in Miami, what happened? - He made one of these porno movies, a bomb right. 18,000 put together. - And what did he get out of it? - A quarter of a mil. A quarter of a mil, Jolly. - Not always. - Now he sits on his big fat ass and he rakes it in all the time. Rakes it in. Now, if you and I put together one of these bombs, we sit back and we rake it in, too. - Yeah, but that asshole downstairs, he's got 20,000 of our dollars plus half our action. - Now he's got it, this time. Next time we do it all alone, (speaking in a foreign language) you understand me? Listen to me, put it together. - Yeah, but what do we know? What do we know about making movies? That's what I'm trying to tell you. I mean, we can't even find the broads. Where are we gonna find the broads? - I said one thing at a time, Jolly, one thing at a time, listen to me. We won't only making these fucking films, but we'll wind up with the most beautiful high-line fucking broads you've ever seen in your life. - And where are we gonna get these high-line broads that I've ever seen in my whole life? - Ah, now he's gonna stop and think. - He says. - Okay, guess where. - Where? - The Totsona pimp Super Spook. - Super Spook. - I got him lined up tonight. We'll put him to the freaking wall. We'll line him up. Sit back, relax, enjoy yourself. Go downstairs and have a ball, all right? - Wait a minute, in other words, (speaking in a foreign language) - That's it, tonight we eat. - Tomorrow we shoot. - Tomorrow we shoot. - That son of a bitch gets back, I'm freezing my ass off. (upbeat romantic music) - Action. Come on, honey, get in the position. You gotta honor these things. Yeah right. Good, great. Good, yeah, yeah, that's it yeah. Great. Yeah right. A little more down great. (speaking in a foreign language) - Gee, I never saw that position before. - What are you worried about, we'll try it tonight. - That's it. - What kind of music do they play in these things? ♫ O come all ye faithful - Oh come on. - Shut up, guys, I'm trying to make a movie. - [Mark] Great. - Let's go, Mimi, I'm getting nervous. - Me, too. - How about me, I wound up with a great dane. - Come on, let's go. - [Cameraman] No dammit, get out of the goddamn way. - [Jolly] Oh shut up. - Come on, move it over. (gentle tropical music) - [Mimi] The decision was just about to be made. I went to Jolly's apartment, where I found him and his little 10-year-old dog. It was really something, to understand what Jolly had with this little animal. They ate together, slept together. But our main object was to get Super Spook. We would supply the business with hookers and young broads from Okie towns that were all starstruck. And these few years of trying to go legit was beginning to be a pain in the ass. We had to be at a quarter. So what do you do? You get some broads, go out and get drunk. Get laid. And then talk to Super Spook. - Yes Mimi, I've got it right from good people. Zantelli told me you were out, as far as Chucky's concerned. And if you're out with Chucky, you're out with everybody. You and your asshole buddies come here to shake up the whole world. Man, you ain't even rocked one square of my ass. Now what are you telling me? - You know something, Super Spook, you work from Sunset to Doheny, from Doheny to La Brea. Had 40 broads. And 40 broads happen to be white. You make a lot of money. They do a minimum of about two to $400 a day. A lot of bread, lot of bread. Now, either you work with us, or you take them 40 broads and go back to fucking Watts. But you better listen to me. Understand me? - Get off of that Sicilian shit. You ain't gonna take my women and put their faces up on the screen so's a cop can bust them every time he sees them. And you ain't gonna take a piece of my action, like you did with Lowenstein bookmakers. Fact is, you ain't taking a fucking thing. - What are you talking about, man? You jive ass mother, you don't know who you're talking to, man. Listen to the man, listen to Mimi. He's got something to offer you. He's got something to offer you good. You know, what's funny, two people in this world are blacks and niggers, and you ain't nothing but a nigger. You'll always be a nigger. Nothing but a nigger and a rotten pimp to boot. He's offering you something out of left field that no one else can deserve but you. And I'll tell you, brother, and I mean brother, we'll rip you off like you've never been ripped off before. You coming out with all of these jive ass movies. What movies? Superhuman movies, super this, super that, super who gots, maybe. You're nothing but a nigger to us. - And a pimp. You're a fucking pimp. Now listen to me, Super Spook. Come here, listen to me. From tonight, I want you to go to sleep. I want you to go to sleep with one eye open. Because I'm gonna choke you. I'm gonna choke your mother, I'm gonna choke your father, I gonna choke your fucking kids. You understand me? Then I'm gonna go to the fucking phone book. I'm gonna look up your last name. Everybody who's got your last name is gonna get choked, too. Now listen to me, you motherfucker. - You guys been watching too many Humphrey Bogart movies. - Mimi, come on, let me rip him off. I can nail him in the parking lot. Let me rip him off. - Hey, you wanna know something? It's Easter Sunday. - I don't give a shit. - Listen to me, it's Easter Sunday. Give me a kiss, come here. We'll nail him. I swear on Marone we'll nail him. I swear on Marone we'll nail him.

Let him make a resurrection. - [Liz] (moans) Happy Easter, Mimi. - [Mimi] Yeah, you too. - Mimi, you seem so far away. - I'm right here. - You don't know what I mean. Mimi, I love you. - I love you too, okay. - I'm serious, when have you ever shown it? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about us, Mimi, you and me. - You mean a pink cottage? The white little picket fence? The patter of little feet? And me coming home with a lunchbox? Can you picture me punching a frigging clock every morning? - No cottage, Mimi and no little feet, just me. If I give a guy everything, I want something back. I don't wanna be treated like a run-of-the-mill hooker. - That's a hell of a thing to say. When did I ever treat you like the run-of-the-mill hooker? Any minute now that door can bust open with Chucky and Zantelli's guys putting me on the deceased list. I'm up to my ass in people looking for me. I'm on borrowed time. Why include you. And honey, that's as far as I'm ever gonna carry love. - It's not far enough. I'm living in hell, too. Mimi, I need your strength. I'm gonna be included when that door opens. And it's going to open. It's going to open. - What do you mean? - I mean there's no turning back for me, Mimi. For the first time in my life, I'm playing it straight. Chucky and Zantelli are setting you up right now. - Really? - That kid Marco. While he was drinking, shot off his mouth. He wasn't drunk, though. - Where does that put you, though? - Well if you'd use your stupid head, you'd see that puts me right alongside of you. (Liz crying) - Hey, hey, hey, come here. Wanna know something? You got a big piece of oregano stuck in your tooth. (Liz laughing) Come here, I don't want my baby crying (dramatic music) (gunshots firing) (upbeat music) (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) - [Mimi] Liz was right, the word was out. Hit Mimi. I didn't know who had the contact on this, but I wasn't waiting to find out. So we killed every last son of a bitch. - Oh, son of a bitch! (men yelling and grunting) - Hey Mimi, long time no see. Where's Zantelli? - He's hanging around inside. - Where? - Up your father's ass. Get in the car, get in. - Marco! Marco! Marco! (speaking in a foreign language) - Marco! Marco! (speaking in a foreign language) - I thought the old days were gone. They got never got my big plans, you understand. - All right, Chucky, all right. - Oh Marco, he was such a good boy. - Aw Chucky, all right. It's all right, Chucky. - We did it Don Mimi's way, now we're gonna do it my way. - All right Chucky, all right. All right Chucky. (dramatic music) (romantic music) - Good evening. What's good for tonight? - Are you dining alone or is Mr. Miceli joining you? - No, Mr. Miceli is taking care of some old business problems. (dramatic music) (romantic music) - Here you go, sir. - Jocko! (dramatic music) (gunshots firing) (suspenseful music) - Liz! - [Mimi] Where does that put you, doll? - [Liz] Well, if you'd use your stupid head, that puts me right alongside of you. I mean, there's no turning back for me, Mimi. - [Priest] Cut from the flesh and blood of Christ, as other lambs without blemish, without spot, who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, what was manifest in these last times for you. - [Fanny] Marco, oh Marco, my baby, Marco! (sobbing) - [Priest] But all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. - Hey, hey what's with the clock? - [Man] Designates the the time the kid was killed. - [Man] 2:29, that's when he got killed? - Mimi would've known, he hit him. - The grass withers. The flower thereof withers away. (women sobbing) - Gently, he's in God's hands now. Oh, my Marco. (sobbing) (clock ticking) (ominous music) (bomb exploding) (gently dramatic music) - [Mimi] You're in or you're in the way. (jet engine roaring) Eye for an eye, but what for? There's nothing left to control. It's all over. I'm going home. (upbeat guitar music) - Mimi (speaking in a foreign language) My son is home! - Papa. (speaking in a foreign language) - So happy to see you together. - Oh, it's wonderful, no? (speaking in a foreign language) You look tired. - I am, I am. - Let's go have fish. (speaking in a foreign language) (gentle music) - It's comfortable here. I've been a lamb on the mattress for the last four years. I just had to come home. - [Don] But what do you plan to do now? - I come home to see you. My son and Bones. - [Don] Fine, but what do you plan to do? - Whatever you want me to do, Father. - [Don] I don't know, isn't this a thing to work for you? - What is there for me to do? It's a different world out there, Papa. Out there, everything's different. You're a big winner here. Out there, you're nothing, Papa. Papa, listen to me. The neighborhoods you controlled are no longer controlled. But they were made up of Jews, Irish, Polish, Italian. They're all black, Papa. There are no more corners to work. The black man has his own man standing on the corner taking action. You and I and Bones here are the last of organized crime. There are no more mobs. The politicians have their own mobs. The President has his own mafia, Papa. Crime is now made up of fanatics. They shoot presidents, congressmen, and judges. Union officials are bumping each other off. Hookers even gave up pimps, Papa. 15, 16 year-old kids, now thumb rides on street corners. They screw for nothing. They call it free love. They screw for old clothes, marijuana, pills. The young blood has knocked us out of the fucking box. Young boys with their hair down to their ass bring dope home to their mothers and fathers to use. They don't fear me, you, the law. You walk up to one of these kids, Papa, and you put a gun to his head and he laughs at you. You know what he calls you? He calls you Humphrey Bogart. I'm not gonna tell you, I'm gonna beg you. Get up, get up before I kill you or you kill me, or the young blood kills us both. Because to them, you, the Patron, the big Don, you're a joke. They took your most intimate life and they write books about it, Papa, successful books. You know what they think of you, Papa? They made a motion picture about you. The most successful fucking motion picture in the history of show business is you. You know what you play in this picture? You play an old dumb Sicilian and a broken-down sweater and a flick gun and you're planting fucking tomatoes. I'm begging you to get out. You sit here in this villa while your old deported paisans bring you fruit and wine because of your connections. The young blood out there knows we're too busy blowing each other up, worrying about one another, disgracing tradition, religion, family. The only connection you got right now, Papa, you know what it is? It's for a hand full of garlic and a cup full of olive oil. I'm begging you, get out. - You are wrong, Mimi. You were always wrong. I know the ways of the young blood. I raised you and your son. I'm the one to come out of the bedroom that you just walked out. I carried him from his dead mother's arms, as I carried you. Not one ounce of trouble he's given me all those years. I made sure that he went to the finest schools, Milan, Paris, London. When you look at his eyes, you'll find them clean and pure. And when you hold his hands, you'll see there's no blood on them. I do a lot those years, Mimi. And (speaking in a foreign language) man have said, corruption, thou art my father. You, me, yes. But not young Mimi. He knows nothing about our transaction. He's well-mannered, suave, and genteel. I cannot hate the young lad as you do, Mimi. Seeing you today is a joy. But seeing him, is a much greater joy. You'll see him, you'll talk to him, and you'll work with him. ♫ Open your heart ♫ Give me my darling ♫ I need you ♫ Come back to me ♫ Open your heart ♫ Please let me love you ♫ Instead of a memory ♫ Open your arms ♫ Take me inside ♫ The dreams ♫ We used to share ♫ We lived in love ♫ It was paradise ♫ When you cared ♫ Give me a chance ♫ To show that I'm sorry ♫ So sorry ♫ I made you cry ♫ Give me that chance ♫ To prove that I want you ♫ Don't make this a last goodbye ♫ Why close the door ♫ On love we once knew ♫ Let's make ♫ A brand new start ♫ Maybe you'll still ♫ Feel that old thrill ♫ If you open your heart - [Mimi] And those Broadway shows, you've got to see some of those shows. - [Son] I've wanted to go for a long time.
