Why are you bathing here? Because a famous flower Spring is here Do you know what this place is? This is that roguish inn Then why do you insist to come? Because I need to find someone Who? King of Left-hand Sword Hua Pin Is he here? Because you may find him... wherever there're bad guys Are you looking for me? I'm not only looking for you, but also Doctor Fei Tell me why are looking for an old freak like me? Do you remember how am I called in the boxers' world? I'm one of the 3 most eccentric freaks Because you're a notorious robber But you're good at killing other bandits Right Thieves have their own code of honor They should rob the rich and help the poor They shouldn't bully the weak and poor And you're a doctor and your patient dies because of you If they don't have good hearts, why should I help them to recover? Lt'd be simpler to finish them It's kind of direct after all And I'm a woman My marriages are more frequent than you guys As you've said, you take whatever you want You don't care about what people think Right I want a blade now Which one? The Deer Cutting Blade Saint Xu Ruzi spent his whole life ...on this blade It's cast with 9 kinds of hardest steel It could break ancient finest weapons Cuts away steel as if it were paper The boxers regard it as a treasure Apart from this, the boxers will respect the one who can take hold of the blade ...as leader of the boxers Because of this, Xu has recently given the sword away To whom? Who is the strongest one in the boxers world? In the boxers world, There're only two Lian Chengbi of Brocade Villa Drifter of the boxers world, Mr. Xiao Xiao was a son of a horse breeder Also he has a bad reputation He's no match for promising Lian ...who comes from an eminent family Xu gave the blade to Lian? On the way, the 4 lethal Leng brothers ...are guarding the delivery You intend to rob it I, Lady Feng have always been like this Why do the boxers just love... to bless the goods with fortune? Why aren't people like me qualified to use the Deer Cutting Blade? It's not that you're qualified but you cannot Who are you? I'm the one who is about to loot the blade Your vital points will be released after 24 hours But until then, I've already got the Deer Cutting Blade Who are you, buddy? Please come down No need to talk Come and get the blade if you're good enough Purple smoke emitted from a stove At the river, a waterfall hanging ahead 3,000 feet the flying water pouring down Like a silver river running down the earth Who are you? I'm me Little Lord Little Lord? Right My name is Little Lord Why haven't I heard of your name? Because I don't want you guys know it What about them? Them? They're my servants Why did you kill them? Cats are kept to catch mice They're kept to kill you They couldn't kill you No need to keep now I think you also want to rob Deer Cutting Blade How smart you're! Everyone of you has a bag Since I don't know which one carries the blade You may kill 4 of us It's too easy What's this joke? Who the hell are you? Go home and tell Lian Xiao has taken the Deer Cutting Blade Congratulations... 12 Flower Servants of Yihua Palace are here Master sent us to congratulate Mr. Lian on owning the Deer Cutting Blade Thank you, sisters Please convey my respects to your master Sure Ladies and Gentlemen Today the boxers world gathers here to congratulate Mr. Lian on owning the Deer Cutting Blade The blade is the marvelous work of Xu Ruzi the King of Swords, of his entire life The name of the sword has the following meaning Qin lost the deer and the world gave chase Only the victor would be able to cut the deer This means one who owns this blade will be the greatest hero of the world Thank you Thank you, everyone I'm not qualified to accept such a honor Lian Chengbi You really know your limits The 2 Zombie of the West and Zombie Casters Right Someone also said We're the subordinates of the King of Hell If you're scared, hand me the Deer Cutting Blade How dare you! White Nether Claws Right This is what our ancestor Mei Qiaofeng dominated the world years ago Who else? Hold it Masters This is a matter of my Brocade Villa I should take care of it myself The blade will arrive here in the afternoon Even though if it arrives, I won't give the blade to villains such as four of you Mr. Lian, I'm very sorry Where's the Blade? Xiao has taken it away Lord Won't you accompany me to my family home? Lady, I'm afraid I can't You see, the blade given by Xu has been taken by Xiao on the road I must look into it immediately Okay I'll go by myself tomorrow then Madam asks you to stop here, have a meal and then... start the trip again Okay, take a rest Madam, please Tea will be fine for me Dad The one in the bamboo forest needs 10 extra eggs and 2 pots of wine He drunk a lot And ate a lot too Sir Not only you drink wine fast, but also eat eggs quick Since I'm faster than other folk I won't waste my time ...on anything Look I'm faster than others even when I get drunk Kid, where are you going? I want to have a meal My madam is up there What do you want to order? I'll get them down for you. Okay? What's the matter? Sister, I'm thirsty and hungry Please help me Please let me have some food Let him come Yes Kid, are you hungry? Sit down Have it Do you live around here? No, I live quite far away Then why have you come here? I want to kill all of them and kidnap you Anyone who can escape death today... may go home and tell Lian It's Xiao who kidnapped his wife Go Who are you? I'm a man who pretends to be drunk Why do you pretend to be drunk? Because when I drank the first cup, I knew it had hypnotizing potion So I took the antidote in advance I wish to find out what's happening here One who is drunk shouldn't wake up Because when you wake up, the troubles will come You're a good boxer Your flying skill is good, but you couldn't escape from my Spearhead How do you know I couldn't? Xiao, goodbye Lord Lord, something bad happened Madam was kidnapped Who did it? A very small gentle kid He's also the one who took the blade Could be Xiao's underling What? Xiao again? Uncle Cousin Uncle. It's strange Cousin Cousin Chun Mei Strange! Why no one is here? You're wrong Not none, but many Yet they're all dead Cousin Cousin Cousin, who is he? I met him on the road What happened to your family? I don't want to talk about it Someone killed all of my families last night What? Who did it? It's Xiao Xiao again? Strange Why is it that all the terrible incidents... are supposed to have been done by Xiao? How do you know Xiao didn't do it? Because I'm Xiao What're you doing? I simply haven't been here at all You may also find out that... the one who appeared yesterday wasn't me Who knows! The man wore a mask yesterday Take cousin away Yes Cousin Cousin, what is this place? Didn't you say that you'd take me home? What? You again? Right. Me again This is what you get for being an assassin 1,000 taels of gold Go on Thanks Cousin, you... I've killed the whole family of uncle It was I who set up a trap to deceive you Why? Because he wants to have you You... Where do you want to go? You're having your wedding night Right here? Right in front of me I want you to rape her here ...and then kill her Why do I have to kill her? Because I want to tell the boxers world Tonight Xiao has raped and killed Lian's wife No wonder the boxers accused Xiao of... doing many bad things You just put all the blame on him Right You guys should have noticed this Who the hell are you? He is Xiao What? Don't come here or I'll kill him! Don't move You didn't enjoy your time How can you leave like this? With whom can I enjoy now? Of course with her What? He's a man How can I enjoy with him? Did you want to watch people doing that? Isn't it better now doing it yourself? Don't come closer Do you like watching people doing this? Okay Mr. Liu Am I not as good as Mrs. Lian? No, you're not Come with me Don't let him go Kill him No place to run You may run away but Mrs. Lian can't After you're dead, I'd take your clothes off Isn't it that Xiao raped and killed Mrs. Lian? You're daydreaming I'll risk my life to stop you from doing this Jump Did you see anything? I didn't. The fog is thick down there It's strange Whose house is it? What do you think? Thanks for saving me Whenever you go to... the Brocade Villa at Lake Damin I'll offer you a great reward What are you doing? I'm leaving Can you? Can you hire a carriage for me? No Why? Because we're in a hilly region; no horse can reach here What are you looking at? Your thighs You're hurt in the thigh If you don't receive medication now, you won't even be able to walk later Sit down Pull up your skirt If you don't receive medication, the poison will grow and spread You know, later perhaps... you'll have to take off your clothes Women are troublesome If I don't give you medication now, you'll pass out because of the poison You won't know what I've done to you I'd say it's quite lethal poison Do you have medical knowledge? I don't know it but I know how to survive It hurts very much Drink it What's this? Hypnotizing medicine After you've passed off... you won't feel pain when I scrape your wound What if I become unconscious? If you don't drink, you'll pass out because of the pain I've prepared these dishes myself Are they delicious? Delicious indeed Come on Thank you You tidy up the house yourself? This is the first time I feel like home here Right I've some fruits kept cool in the water Let me do it There's a red and big grape in the hill Very delicious I'll get some for you to try tomorrow Tomorrow? I've recovered I ought to leave tomorrow In March, the goats are happy with the long grass Who will feed the wolf in the freezing winter People pity the goat and leave the wolf along The heaven is unpredictable and the world is cold Stop drinking or you'll be drunk Drunk and sleepy I am. Please leave Go One has got to leave sooner or later We live in two different worlds It happened that we met each other Since the day I've met you I know, that the day of parting will come This morning I saw this beautiful narcissus I took home... and planted it for you Some day if & when we meet again... please tell me how the flower is growing I don't know when you'll come again and we'll meet again Please tell me how I may send you home Inside please Hanghu Do you want a room? We need two Okay. Please come with me Please You take this room From here how far is it to the Brocade Villa? You mean the house of... the greatest swordsman? It takes 3 days to reach there Sir, what else do you need? Nothing. Thanks I'll be at your service anytime It takes 3 days to go to your home 3 days later, where are you going? It's very quiet What are we waiting for? We're waiting for 3 dark nights and one parting Xiao Tonight I'll treat you to a drink Why? Because it's a tradition to say thank you You've no need to thank me because you don't owe me anything Miss Chen... Miss Chen... If I'm not wrong, you're the Plum, Orchid, chrysanthemum and Bamboo, the Fourth Lethal Swords of Leng Family Yes, we are I've never been an enemy of your family Yet, why do you want to kill me? We're not qualified to kill you One who wants to kill you is in the Bamboo Grove Mr. Lian Xiao is here Lian Chengbi Step aside Ever since I lost the Deer Cutting Blade, I knew there'd be a battle between you & I You took away Chen Bijun The battle becomes unavoidable I need it to wash away my shame What did you think we had done? Nothing You guys didn't do anything because I trust Chen very much If you tried to offend her, he wouldn't come back alive But the world of boxers... doesn't share my view Because they think Xiao is the kind of person who did only the bad things I don't expect the greatest swordsman is just like a man on the street To hear your name is better than to meet you I feel the opposite My opinion is To meet you is better than to hear your name Others think that you're a bandit But I think you're a gentleman Bullshit Why do you want to kill me? Do you know that you can't do whatever you want in boxers world I can't afford to have the Deer Cutting Blade and wife... taken away by you As what you said, won't that be dying unjustly? At least you may die like a man and I may die like a reputed boxer The boxers world is always full of nonsense I can't kill you today because I can't find a concrete reason As long as others know that I win ...it'll be enough for me Besides it's not fair to kill you today because you were hurt before coming here When you recover, go to the Brocade Villa What? You killed Xiao? Hadn't he been hurt before meeting me... I would already have killed him You're wrong Xiao didn't kidnap me He saved my life Why didn't you ask me before you went? What? Your husband was risking his life and you're blaming him for it Where are you going? To apologize to Xiao You've been away for half a month You don't care about your husband but go to apologize to his enemy! It's because I owed him a big favor But I owe you nothing Bijun... Wake up? Did you save me? Yes Do you usually take off your clothes? I know it's healthy to have sun tan It may keep you young as well I heard that... there's a woman in the boxers world called Lady Feng She's a good boxer and carefree always taking off her clothes ...in front of men Right That's me There's no one else You married many times? It's because I've loved many men but I found out later they ain't as desirable as I imagined So I fell in love with another man Guess you haven't heard of my nickname? Man Junkie? To be repulsive, I'm a notorious slut Very strange Men can have a wife and concubines Women have to stay with the men they don't like, for the rest of their life Who will stay with them forever? You The hero in the boxers world You're wrong I'm not a hero but rather a notorious bandit Who are you? I'm Xiao What? What is it? You regret saving me, is it? You're wrong this time I save the people who need my help I don't mind who they might be Oh, Xiao likes to denude women! Why did you do it? Because I heard that Xiao is a good boxer I've a query Your reputation is justified now But it's strange Who is able to kill you? I am Lian of the Brocade Villa What do you want? Where is Chen Bijun? Since the day she left the inn, I'd never seen her again Bullshit What's going on? Chen left on a rainy and windy night He's looking for you How couldn't you know where she is? Lian Chengbi You don't look like an unreasonable man I'm no liar too If you don't believe still, you may ask Lady Feng He's been lying here fainted for 7 days He just woke up today Though Chen didn't come I still need to see you because her heart has left me Xiao the battle in Bamboo Grove should have a result today Listen This strictly concerns just me and him You may only move away our dead bodies but you couldn't get involved Okay, if this is the final battle... It'll be a fair duel You won in the Bamboo Grove because I was hurt at that time I win today because your heart is broken Forget it We should pick another day ...to finish the battle when we're not hurt anymore Say, If I see Chen again, I'll ask her to go back to you Mr. Lian If a woman's husband is having a concubine outside, will a hero like you fight for her like this? The flower blossoms And it blossoms very quickly Why do you come back here? Sincere apologies for what happened at the inn Besides I also wanted to see... how the flower is Why? Why we meet... and part again? You won't part from now on Because tonight you'll die here! How do you know I'm here? I've been following her Go We have no place to go They are coming Go Search Over this side it's a steep cliff And there's no other way to go Did they go that way? No The house there No one ever dares to go inside What about this? You stay here When you see them, inform me immediately Yes Why are there many puppets? Sun and Moon Kids, Lord of Five Elements 12 Flower Servants of Yihua Palace Who are they? They're the best fighters in the boxers world Why are the two old folks here? Who they are? They're the Red Peach and Green Willow who dominated the boxers world 30 years ago When they teamed up they're invincible I heard they've retired for 30 years Why then are their puppets here? My dearest guests, welcome My apology I'm Xiao To disturb you in the night I'm very sorry Oh, it's okay I think you've had a long trip and must be feeling very thirsty Come and serve tea Yes May I ask what this place is? Besides, why're there many puppets of the famous people of the boxers world? This is the most famous Solitary Villa Doesn't belong to your mortal world These boxers are real people, but our Mr. Tian has shrunk and placed them here Every time when there is full moon they may move like normal people ...but only for 15 days When the moon eclipses, they will become frozen again The big house locked with a chain there is to lock up the evil spirits Sir, your tea Please Who's Mr. Tian? He's the king of miniature world Why does he shrink the famous boxers, turn them into puppets... and place them here? I heard he has a wish to have every famous boxer shrunk and to be kept beside him Where did he shrink them? Here. At the Solitary Villa How does he manage to do that? The same as with you Drink a cup of tea first A bit dazzled? You're supposed to be You'll be pass out soon Come on This was the cup I used last night I recalled after I had used it, I put it here Then they're... They're the puppets of the 12 Flower Servants Did we come to the Puppet Villa? I think we're spellbound by the old folk and have been shrunk Go These are the chopsticks used by big people We've really shrunk in size Big is small, small is big Nowhere is somewhere, somewhere is nowhere Are you the Red Peach and Green Willow who had a historical battle at Tian Mountain It happened years back Few boxers might perhaps recall this After the battle, both of you never appeared again People still discuss... as to where you had vanished! Here's not a human world Whoever comes here... will disappear forever Not a human world? Go Cliffs on all sides Where do you want to go? Even if you go back to the human world, you're a just puppet after all Then why bother? Come with me to see Mr. Tian The old hasn't left and the new arrives There're different kinds of heroes There will be different kinds of puppets Xiao comes here finally We finally meet Are you Mr. Tian? That's what they call me In fact, a name is just an identification It doesn't matter what one is called What the hell is this place? Not a human world, but it's the outer space You're all puppets Actually all creatures are puppets Men are the puppets of heaven but you're the puppets of men Why did you shrink us? It's my secret I'll tell you later Besides, knowing too much isn't a good thing All you need to know now is... you're not human anymore but a mere puppet You're not living in a human world but in the Puppet Villa Strange Why did Mr. Tian shrink us? What is the secret of the Puppet Villa? Mr. Xiao, look He's the only one who could escape from here Who is it that wants to leave? Just follow him Madam What did you say? Whoever wants to leave this place... should follow him Who is it? The wife of a man to whom I'm going to worship Someone who can escape from here I've been here for 30 years I'm always hoping that it's just a dream But now I know I'd never wake up from this dream Why don't you leave? Leave? In other's eyes, I'm just like an ant They could kill me as easy as snapping their fingers Where could we go? Unless we could be like them free from the spell of Mr. Tian and turn back to our normal size lt'd be different Is it possible? Yes If you can run all of your blood... on this platform; The spouse of that person... will be from the spell I recall that night Right here The husband stabbed himself in the belly All his blood dripped out Then his wife disappeared I hear she's really back to the human world Why must it be a couple? It's got to be a couple to break the spell Because Mr. Tian thinks that... couples make the most loving partners of all It's not necessarily true I've promised Mr. Lian If I see you again, I will definitely send you back Go back please You've a home and family I'm just a drifter Who cares if I'm dead or alive Who is he? He's the one who took the Deer Cutting Blade What are you doing here? I'm delivering the wedding invitation Whose wedding? Find it out yourself Where's the wedding? You want to know Then go to The Solitary Villa Looking for Xiao and Chen? Right Please drink this tea first Mr. Lian, you wake up What's this place? Did you say you're looking for Xiao and your wife? They're here You couldn't die You shouldn't die for me In my life... there's nothing I should or shouldn't do but something I love to do You love to die for me? Xiao You bastard and bitch Sweetheart... Mr. Lian Why are you here? Never expected, did ya? My beloved... What are you doing? I'll kill both of you Mr. Lian, it's a misunderstanding We didn't do anything bad to you I'm doing this... to save her back to the human world Back to the human world? Right We're spellbound and turned into puppets We're not in the human world What? You're wrong You're not puppets You're set up by someone What is it all about? Go Let me tell you what happened Mr. Tian hired many puppet specialists He first had a model of the Villa ...placed inside the house The house is called Solitary Villa Then... He placed therein puppets of many good boxers When you walked into the house, it gave you an illusion After you drank the hypnotizing potion... and passed out, you all are moved here He made some extra large cups and chopsticks Because of this, You all were deceived How do you know? Because one day... three of us saw Mr. Lian making his way quite hurriedly We felt strange and followed him Where is the Solitary Villa? Come with me We shouldn't go inside They said Mr. Tian locked the evil spirits in this house Let's go inside We're here Here's the only way to go out They tried to scare you because they're afraid that... you would discover their trick I see This game of the Puppet Villa... is finally over You all would certainly be surprised For what did I do all this! First I need to tell you Mr. Tian is my father I'm his daughter We think people are jerks... and can be fooled like puppets No matter if you're the greatest Lian or the most carefree Xiao Nonsense. Are you done talking? Before you take any action, I've something to say My father built this villa, its purpose being to gather all boxers and to rule the boxers world If you're interested to sell yourself, please sit down and have a talk You're dreaming Steel and Iron Zombies? Red Peach and Green Willow? Have you not heard that... we've been invincible, in the boxers world for 60 years? It's because you didn't sell yourselves ...at that time Right. It's really The Nether Palm Not only you meet my Nether Palm, but also expose yourself in this room that is built with Icy Stone When the light is out, the cold air will invade you If you survive from my Nether Palm, you'd probably die of the cold frost Xu Ruzi? Right I'm Mr. Tian We never expect... such a reputed boxer could be the most notorious villain in the boxers world Don't you believe? As I come from a reputed family, I make use of this to do bad things Since I'm from reputed family, I get the notion that... I can perhaps rule the boxers world with the name of our family The people are foolish. They're all addicts of wine, sex, money or fame I just gave away the Deer Cutting Blade The boxers would kill each other for it Even the greatest of heroes like you guys were getting involved in the matter You must wonder... why I didn't kill you, ...when you passed out! It's because you're still useful to me To be frank, I want to buy you I've known already the so-called good guys ...all have ruthless hearts Father This is my last warning You'd better sell yourselves I tell you honestly You're no match for me You'll definitely be killed by my last move You may try This is the Deer Cutting Blade The Double Swords of Lian Family I think you've heard about it No matter what you hold in your hands ...you'll be eventually killed Let's take a look at this place The message is right Two of you are the most lethal boxers Mr. Tian, stop You'd pay for what you did Why act against fate? Shut up Mr. Tian The last move My dear, it's terrible Lady Feng and others are all dead You... Nothing I just stroke your vital points Did you ask about the last move? She's my last move Her surname is Xu, her sister, and my adopted daughter as well What? Didn't you hear it? I did it because I belong to the Xu Family I'm his daughter I should have known earlier If you didn't have good flying skill, how could you survive jumping off a cliff? The marriage between you and me? I set all these up Didn't I mention before? People are foolish People are addicts of money, sex or fame The Deer Cutting Blade A pretty woman Heroes like two of you here... were fooled by me easily What's about the wolf den? Was it a part of your father's plan? Right He brought me to the den But there's something out of the plan That was afterwards I fell in love with a wolf Mr. Lian, I'm sorry And you I've been with you for two years but I've never loved you But I... I know I know you really love me That's why I must apologize to you In fact you knew already A goat isn't necessarily lovable than a wolf A human could be more cruel than a wolf Why did you trust me so much? Do you know why? Well You people should come out... of your fantasies What is it? You want to be killed by me or help me to rule the boxers world? I've told you... you'd pay for what you did Why did you still act against the divine order? Very good Dad You promised me not to kill them I cheated the whole world Could I cheat you as well? But I'm your daughter Sister Probably you're too deep into this man How could these two powerful beings be freed? Sister Dad, I'm begging you Please don't kill them Very good Dad will listen to you Dad Xu Ruzi. You're crazy? Who says I'm crazy? Before I get to rule... I need to wipe out my enemies But she is your daughter Daughter? Do you know there're many precedents of a son overthrowing his father? Do you also know... Many emperors of different dynasties ...killed their own sons Sister Bijun, leave me alone Run away now Chen Bijun Release my vital point Let me finish them Daydreaming Bijun Dad Sister You're so cruel! Bijun... You run away now If the flower in the wolf den grows well, ...offer it at my grave Master The Heaven Villa was wiped out Though you didn't love me I want to tell you All along these 2 years I've always loved you Do you have anything to talk to her? Yes, a lot It's a pity she can't hear anymore Bijun loves wolves Aren't you taking her along? No, I'm a drifter lt'd be futile letting her stay there all alone lt'd be just the same visiting at her grave when the flower blossoms every year
