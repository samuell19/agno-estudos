Music. Yes, yes, I know keep it up. Don't move. Wait. That's good. Right here. A little bit. Beautiful. Yeah. [Camera clicks] Hi. Thanks for having me here. Anytime. [Motorcycle engine] Music. I must leave you now. I'm sorry. I cannot stay. But in spite of you, there is one thing... I take away with me tonight. When I enter before God. Sweeping the bright stars from the blue threshold with my salute. One thing, I'm staying... By death, by doom and finger, see it there. The white plume over the battle... A diamond in the ash of the ultimate combustion... My... Pernan. Music. [Audience clapping] Bravo! [French conversation] [Laughs] Sorry, Mr. Yeats. Oh, Mr. Yeats, that was the best Serrano ever. Ah, yes. Serrano, madam. It's pronounced Serrano. They call me... What the hell happened to cue 2-4-8. For God's sake. It's one of the best moments in the play and I have to share it with everyone in the dark. I'm sorry, John, but then it's still my... The thing is all in the theater. Uhm, what the hell is all this? A photo session. Alright. It's an honor to meet you, sir. I'm Mario Cotone. Hey. And this is my right hand, Meg Kim. I thought you'd be older. Well, don't worry. I appreciate young talent. You know, I grew up watching your films. I've never seen you on stage before I've gotta tell you. You know you really made me feel for Serrano. No, Serrano. [Laughs] Thank you. Serrano. That's what I said. What kind of a stage manager are you, anyway? I mean, the leaves in the last scene. Every night they get bigger and heavier. Tonight, it was like some goddamn sand bag falling on me. It nearly killed me with this. What's this? Ah, these are from yesterday. Ah, I didn't see you there. That's my style. Hmm. Now that lighting's good. Show that to the boys, there'll learn something. Oh, get the hell out of here. I love you, anyway. [Laughs] You're good. You're very good. Now, what else do you need? Well, this was supposed to be a home layout. [Laughs] Young man, this is my home. Okay, ah... I'll have some shots while you taking your makeup off. Fire away. Alright. Kim, put the light away. I don't need it. The mayor's outside. No, Tom. Tell him to go away. I'll see him at the party later. [Camera clicking] Look, I hate to rush you but I don't have a great deal of time. [Clears throat] There, you both, uh, are welcome to come to the party later if you like, both of you. But no photographs, huh? Thank you. Oh, by the way, they asked me to get a shot of you with your family? Absolutely not. Music. Hi. Do you see that? What? Her. [Laughs] Wow. Jesus Christ. One smile. Give me the camera with full range. I don't know about you, I'm not staying around for this. Shut up. Here, spread your legs. No, thanks. You're not my type. God damn it. Stand here. Alright. Come on, don't push. Don't move. [Camera clicks] Shit. [Camera clicks] She saw us, we're history. [Applause] Mr. Yeats, it was truly an outstanding performance. Truly? Truly. The pants were too tight. You are truly bad. The son of a bitch is kissing her. I don't care if he's banging her. Let's get the hell out of here. Go find out who she is, where she lives and what she does, okay? Go and get her phone number. Music. Look at that. I think I know somebody over there. Come on. No, thanks. It's all too weird. But I'll call you later. Bye. Bye. Like it? I can't believe my father gave you permission to take my picture. He didn't. I couldn't resist. Hey, you can have more if you like. You have a great look, you know? I find it inspiring. I realized that these pictures don't really do you justice. I'd like to ask you to pose for me. No, no, thank you. Nicole. Let let me take you home. I don't even know you. Ah, that's right. I'm sorry. You know, my name is Mario Catone. I'm a professional photographer. I just did a layout for your father, so that proves I'm not a maniac, right? Look, this may sound strange to you but... I've been looking for somebody with just your look. I really have to go. Bye. [Car engine] What did he want? I don't know. He just gave me these pictures. Your father's not gonna like this. Hey, look. I just wanna talk. I just wanna talk, that's all. I wanna just talk to you. Hey, pal. Why don't you give me a break and pullover? Come on. Don't pay attention to him. All I'm asking for is two minutes. I better not go back to the house. Don't exaggerate, Charlie. He's not a maniac. Do you believe this punk? He's got the nerve. I'll give him that. Stop the car, Charlie. Do you want me to wait? No. What do you want? I could see he's afraid of me. If I were you, I wouldn't try anything with him. I ain't that interested in him. You're crazy. You know, my father is the type that would call the police. All I want to do is talk to you, that's all. And if you hate me you can call the police, how's that? I have nothing to say to you and I'm really not interested in taking any pictures either. Do you think I chase girls around all the time? I wouldn't be surprised. Alright, I like you too. What do you suggest I do, huh? Perhaps I should call your mother mother to have her invite me for some tea. You don't give up. Tell her to expect my call at 8:00. Oh, I'll tell her. 8:00, sharp. [Motorcycle engine] So you met him at the theater? No! I didn't know you let photographers in. That's what I get for being so nice. He's stolen these pictures of you without you even knowing it. Wise guy, that little punk. If you encourage him, we'll never get rid of him. Oh, daddy, don't exaggerate. He's not so bad. Not so bad. Wait 'till you catch yourself in the National Enquirer. Then I better run out and renew my subscription. This is not a joke. He wants to make a name for himself and he's invading our privacy to do it. He's not such a bad photographer. I am not discussing his talents. [Karate sounds] Kick him in the ass. Bye dad. I'm gonna go change. [Phone rings] Hello. Ms. Nicole. Who? Nicole Yeats. She's not here. How'd you get my number? My private number? I got your private number, so we can have a private conversation. Hello. Hello. Alright, Mommy, get off the phone. I'm hanging. Let's go. Private conversation, huh? Mama's boy. So, where are we meeting tomorrow? Mario, I don't think you quite understand. I just love the way you pronounce my name, you know? Come on, I'll do anything you want, alright? Just give me a little trust and I promise I won't try and come on to you, how's that? Oh, sorry, Nicole. Oh, I have to get off. Wait was that your father? Put him back on. I'm gonna ask him. Oh, he'd just love that. Come on, Nicole. Meet me in front of Tavern in the Greens, 3:00, okay? I can't. Alright. I'm willing to wait like a schmuck. I'll wait there 'till 4:00, alright? If you don't show up at 5:00 then I'll leave at 6:00. Goodbye, Mario. Goodbye. She's gonna be there, Mac. What do you think? [Dog whining] What's the matter? What, are you jealous, huh? I still love you, my boy. Mama. I'm ready. Let's go. Ho-ho-ho. If you weren't my mother, forget about it. [Laughs] Give me a hug. I want to take you dancing tonight. Come on, Mom. [Runs down the stairs] [Traffic sounds] You gotta be crazy. I busted my ass trying to get you a big break and what do you do? You screw things up for me and the agency. Where do you get the guts to photograph Yeats's daughter? I want those pictures and the negatives. Where are they? If there's anything, Leo. Don't worry about nothing, alright? I gave the pictures to Nicole. You gave them to Nicole. Thank God you're leaving. Well, Nicole's father is waiting to see you. Now, you be sure that he gets the negatives and an apology before he sues both of us or has me black ball. Oh, by the way, I'd like to postpone my trip for a while. No freaking way. You're leaving next Tuesday. Sorry, I won't be ready. Well, if you're not ready, I'm gonna send somebody else. How can you be so unprofessional and stupid. You know, I really love to accompany you when you bring those negatives back. I would love to get the chance to see Yeats kick your ass. Now, get out of here. You know when you want to be, you could be a real prince. Well, a guy should always do what he's good at. Hey, come on, get going. Try being a prince with Yeats. Like you said, Leo... A guy should do what he's best at. And give my best to your mother. Yeah. Well, where's my coffee? You should be converted by now. Ah, sweetheart, ah... Playing a lady, you are to the man of bourne, the man of bourne... But I must keep reminding you that Roxanne is also a virgin and I appreciate how difficult it is for you in anyway to convey virginity, but be a good girl. Please try! Props, chastity belt. Go on. Take three lines back from there. Um, the nun that has been trying to convert him maybe is converting him again, but I've never seen him this late. He should be converted by now. That's terrific. See, simple, just like that. Thank you. I want to talk to you about the lighting. When I come in in the second act and I'm desperately trying to find the-- Who the hell let you in? The gorilla. My boss said you wanted to see me? Yes, that's right, I did. I don't want you taking anymore photographs of me or my daughter, do you understand? And I want all those negatives. Every one of them, is that clear? You'll get them. Charlie, make sure he finds his way out and stays out. Why is it that when I come in in the second act, I have to grope my way through scenery in order to find just one little pinpoint of light! Music. Hey, take a walk. It's about time. What? It's about time. I was just with your father, that's why I'm late. You were with my father? Here. I'm supposed to give him these. What is it? The negatives of your pictures. Well, I told you he wouldn't like this. You know, he's a man who's used to getting what he wants. Yeah, his way or no way, I know the type. Not that he was much cooler like in his movies. Oh, don't worry about it. I'll handle him. That's fine with me. I just want to handle you. [Laughs] So, where are we going? You sure? I'm sure. Alright, come on. What a fool. Don't worry about it. I don't want to die either. Put that helmet on. Now... I'm gonna show you why... I love NY. Hug me. Tighter. Music. Ah excuse me. Is this your idea of showing off? Look, if you admit that you're scare, I'll slow down. Go ahead, impress me. [Tires screeching] [Motorcycle engine] Trust me. A picture is basically the point of view of the person who takes it, right? Let me show you. Okay. In this land, I have a totally new concept that's never been done before. You see... The point of view of the picture... Is in the picture. Alright, what I'm gonna do... Is give you the whole background in black and white, okay? And then in the center of attention, boom! In this case, the Chrysler building in color... At night. It's a totally new system and it's not a montage either. What do you think? I'm speechless. I gotta hurry though. They're moving the whole top of the tower next week. You mean you don't know? Oh yeah, it's a big million dollar operation. They're gonna lift it with seven helicopters and move it to the top of the Olympic tower. Don't ever tease me about my work. I don't know. I mean I didn't mean it. I just I didn't know what else to say. So, think of something quick. Ah, it's great, really. I'm telling the truth seriously. It's great. That's better. Music. I'm gonna call this one, von voyeur. Only the girls is gonna be in color. In English that means, uh - Say to say. What? It's just I've never seen such music. Okay. Yo, Mario! Throw it Joey. Yeah, outta boy! Good luck. [Motorcycle engine] There she is. Hey, hey, hey! I don't believe it. Did you see that? Dog took my goddamn apple. Ah, it may take a while, but I am gonna get that shot. Music. What is that? Oh, this is my grandpa I mean my mother's. What is it, an heirloom.? No, my mother's departed. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. No, no, no. She's not dead. She just sort of went away. Ah, I wonder whose fault that was. It's nobody's fault. They just divorced. You know what? I don't know, it seems like all my friends' parents are divorced. Do you feel that people used to get married for like the dumbest reasons? I don't know. I just think my mom is just too young. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, my mom's departed, too. I mean my-- my-- my father's departed. I mean he's dead. Oh, what a day. Now you see what you do to me. I'm getting a little cold. Yeah? Yeah. Ah, I'll give you a choice. You can have a big hug... Or hot cappuccino. I'll take the big cappuccino. You don't know what you're missing. Here you go, Mario. Enjoy. Thanks, Judy. So, one of your favorite places, huh? Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me? I just love the cuisine here. Go ahead, eat it. You are so... What? Go. What? Let me tell you something, I've been coming to Ferrari's my whole life, okay. This is the first time I've seen anybody eat one of those with a knife and fork. Yeah, but if I pick it up, it will squish out the tins. Oh, really. You're really a waspy girl, aren't you? Here, put this down, put this down. Like this. Oh, I see. A wasp has to eat it with, ah, papers, huh? While a waft can eat it without papers. [Laughing] What are they, playing? It's nitza. What's up, men? It's uh, kind of like a... Roman baseball. You want to try? Hey, they don't make Yankees, that way, huh. Oh, the mets ah. Hey, Mario, let's see if you still got it. No, don't worry about me. My girl here wants to give it a shot. Well, am I? What are you doing? Go ahead. She can handle the stick pretty well. Watch your mouth. No, just hit the front of it and give it a whack. Okay. Oh, okay. Me and here against you guys. Oh, I don't think so. Take it easy. Hey, Mario. Are you gonna jump on her, too? Oh, shut him up, alright. Hey, Mario. She got a sister for me? Listen, Nicole, sorry about that, huh? Hey, here's my man. You know, Mario, you got the life. Every time I see you with a girl she gets nicer and nicer. Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm Tony, staring at you. This is my cousin Tony. This is Lisa and uh Kelly. Are you gonna take some pictures of me liked you promised? Or is it gonna be my turn? Oh can't you see, he's already for some goppa stairs? What's ah what's this gappa, goppa? It's goppa stairs. What does it mean? Ah, it doesn't translate... Could you paraphrase it? Alright, it means to... Go upstairs. Goppa stairs, you see? Go upstairs. Did you ever gappa, goppa oh, whatever with that girl back there? Which one? Dumb question. They probably think I'm your next victim. Are you still cold? Yeah. Yeah? Me too. Come on. Yeah, come here. Come on sit down. Relax. I'm fine. Come on if anything, I'm putting more clothes on you, right? Come here. Come here. This is the first why I love New York. I call it bomb's eye view of the right race. Who? Hello. Who's this? You wish to speak with Mario? Who are you? Who's the bitch? What are you doing there? It's my father. Who? It's my father. Just take it, please? What does he want? Hello. So this is why you haven't called me, huh. Why didn't you just tell me? I'll talk to you later. You know it does get pretty colorful down here. That's one for you. I wasn't expecting you in. Hey, Mama [Foreign language] This is Nicole Yeats... And this is Anna. The woman who claims to be my mother. She doesn't speak English? My English is fine. How is your Italian? He's good, huh? He's the best around. What do you do? I study. Aha, that's nice. What? Psychology. Why don't you come downstairs, I'll fix something to eat. No, no, no, ma. It's late and she's cold. We've got to catch the subway. Yeah, I really should be going. Well, I hope to see you again. Good night. Ciao. Oh yeah. [Foreign language] Excuse me. Hey move out of the way. Music. I think, uh I think we missed our transfer. How do you feel, okay? I'm okay. How do you feel? Good. I'm fine. Feel okay? Yeah sure. [Laughs] Quit staring. I still want to take some shots of you. You lied to me, you know? Strictly business, huh? [Laughs] Oh no, you kissed me. [Laughs] Well, I had a great day, thank you. I'll call you before you sleep. Give me time to get home. I will. Okay, ciao. I don't believe what I just saw. Oh, come on, I was just - come on. What the hell do you think you're doing, hmm? Can't you see, he's just an ambitious little bastard? He's you're caviar for him. Do you understand that? What's that? The negatives you asked for. Besides, you're making me lose face, Nikki. I told him today, he's not to see you anymore. What right did you have to say that? We're late, Mr. Y. Let them wait. I don't give a damn. We went to little Italy, that's all. Just had some fun. I even met his mother. Mario is not the kind of person you think he is. You're sure of that, huh? After one day? Very perceptive. Music. You want me to discourage him? I could make it very clean. Oh, Charlie, you've been seeing too many of my movies. [Phone rings] I miss you already. Oh, I miss you too. Leo, what do you want? How'd it go with Yeats. Great. The guy wants to adopt me. Aha, sure that's why he just called me. Hey, you better stop fooling around with his daughter. I'm not fooling around with her. Alright. Look since you're not leaving next week, I want you to cover Fire Island Saturday. Oh, no, come on, Leo. That's another shit job. No way. I'm not working this weekend. Hey, you don't want to work at ball, you don't want to work here, where do you want to work? God damn it. [Recording] Excuse me, please deposit 5 cents for the-- Wait, operator. There's some mistake. I'm not on the payphone. [This is a recording] Shit. [Phone rings] I know I'm a jerk, I'm an asshole, I'm unprofessional, alright? Mario. Nicole, ah, sorry. I thought you were my boss again. You want me to call you back? No, no. He just called me and I thought it was you and I told him that but never mind. What happened to your father? Nothing. Good. Can you come with me on Saturday? Are you having a problem with your work? I'm a little frustrated right now. You see quality work doesn't pay the bills, right, so I gotta take the shit jobs. And my boss Leo, he-- he keeps fathering me and-- You don't want to hear this crap. No, I do. Really? Of course, I'm interested. Uh, it looks like we have a lot to talk about on Saturday. I'm not going to see you until Saturday? Well, I'd love to, but I'm committed to finish one of those shitty assignments by the weekend. Besides, this will give you a chance to miss me. By Saturday, I might forget you. Well in that case, I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Bye-bye. Ciao. What did I tell you Mac, hmm? Good boy. [Motorcycle engine] You gotta help me today. You want to be my assistant? What do I have to do? What do you mean? 50 color, 80 black and white, you got it? Okay, 50 color, 80 black and white. I got it. Sorry, sorry. We're ready, go. Before we start, I'd like to know who's the groom. I I'm whoever I am. [Camera clicks] Do you Allan take Chuck to be your lawfully wedded spouse, in sickness and in health, 'till death separate you? I do. And you Chuck, take Alex to be your lawfully wedded spouse in sickness and in health, 'till death separate you? I do. Chuck is Chuck Bolton, you know the famous designer? Uh-hmm. Chuck? No, I'm Alex. I'm sorry. Chuck and Alex, have you the rings? Yes. Alex, put the ring on Chuck's finger. Chuck, put the ring on Alex's finger. Shut up. That's a wrap. [Applause] Yeah, well you surely cover some weird events. I know. God, I don't even know you could keep a straight face. If this was you showing off. They pay me for it. This is ridiculous. Come on a minute. Just a minute. I gotta take it seriously no matter what it is. You admit you're showing off, I'll stop teasing you. But I want to take a picture of you and show you how ridiculous you look right now. What are you talking about? Stay there. [Camera clicking] This is great. This is great. Just move your head a little to the left. Whoa, beautiful, beautiful. Don't think about anything. [Camera clicking] You know, you really are something. The way you look, you can have a big career. No way, an actress or model. The only one I would ever let take pictures of me is you. Ah, you'll think differently after you see these pictures. I don't know. Let's see. Are you always like this when you work? Ah, it can get pretty intense sometimes. Mario, how many girls have you, uh - photographed? I don't know. I never counted. Well, in just one day, I met two... And I'll bet you photographed that one who insulted me on the phone. I think I'd rather take pictures than talk. That's what you invited here for, to work? Yeah, what else? What are you doing? Teasing, having fun. How far do you plan on going? As far as you want. I'm beginning to like you. I thought it was obvious. Just get off, shit. You want me to screw you? Is that what you expect from me? If you want to. You know, for a guy from little Italy, you're a major score, alright? I can get a lot of mileage at this. I want to make love to you. So, why don't you? There's something I'm not quite sure you understand about me. Which is? How many guys have you made love with? None. How many guys have you screwed? None. None? Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that you're a-- you're a virgin? You don't act so amazed? But in this day and age, you gotta be the ugly or dead and you sure as hell ain't ugly. Listen, Mario, if you want to work, fine. Come on. Christ. Look... I wanted it to come from here, not from here. Okay? Music. [Motorcycle engine] You got it. You're doing great. Just nice and easy. Okay. You're doing great. Just pull over, over here. Just right here. Okay. Like this, here? Yeah, stop. Stop the bike. Stop the bike. Okay. Stop the bike. Okay. [Motorcycle engine stops] First time. Pretty good. So what are we doing? Don't worry about it. Sit down. Back here, back here. So? My God, what are you doing? I just want to catch you with your hair flying. My hair? Yeah. Hang on a second. [Motorcycle engine] Alright. Oh my God. Come closer to me. Closer, closer, closer. Perfect, yeah. Isn't this a little obscene, Mario? You're gonna love it. Uh-hmm. Let's go. Sorry. Music. Beautiful. You're driving me crazy. Look at me. [Camera clicks] Look at me. Look here. I'm driving. Faster. Go faster. Beautiful, yeah. Come on. Yeah, yeah. Go faster. [Shouts and crashes] [Ambulance sirens] Alright. Let's go. Come on. Move it. I was so scared. You were scared. I think I fell when when you didn't answer me. The only thing I could think about was how stupid I was to let you drive how much I love you. It could have been worst. Even the camera survived. Well, I hope the pictures do. You're an irresponsible idiot do you know that? If you weren't injured, I'd throttle you right where you sit. Dad. Will you wait a minute? Oh, shit. Please wait a minute. Nicole, Nicole. Excuse me. This way. Mr. Yeats, can we have - One question. When did you find out about your daughter? Good job. Over here, Mr. Yeats. Well, don't you think I don't care about her? Listen to me. I care. I'll never do anything to hurt your daughter. Just listen to me for a second. God! What happened? Are you alright? Just take me home for now. It was my fault. I was driving. Tomorrow, there'll be pictures of all of us in every paper. Ever since you met that bloody papparrozzo, my life's in chaos. You're not to see him again. Oh, yes, I will. And I'll lie to you if I have to. Well in that case, when you feel better you can start packing. You'll finish school in England. I won't go. You can't force me either. Oh, yes. I damn well can. I'm you're father. If you think your daughter is going to sit home for the rest of her life, you're wrong. I finally found a reason to go out and meet different kinds of people... And really like being with Mario. I really feel myself when I'm with him. I never realized you could be so damn irresponsible. Look at you. Look at the way you're dressed. You've known him 10 days and already you look like some goddamn bum. Oh... Look... Oh, Christ. If I thought Mario was right for you, we wouldn't be even having this conversation. He's only after you because of who you are. No, you're wrong. Mario couldn't care less about who I am. He only cares about what I am and I like what he's trying to accomplish in his life. But of course, all you're worried about is your image. Look at your relationship with Irene. If you really believe that then I failed. You never want to see it from my side. Nicole's not dead, right? She's out, sir. Yeah, of course not. Ms. Yeats is out. And of course, you gave her my previous messages? Who is this? Mario. Mario? Of course, you didn't. Yes sir. Well, just tell her I called, okay? Well, of course. See if you could handle that? What do you want? [Dog whines] Jesus... He really looks pissed off in this one. This is gonna cause problems. With the agency? He can be a real son of a bitch. You know these people are all connected. I mean Mario is just getting ready to breakthrough. He really doesn't need this now. I'm surprised, Yeats hasn't called me already. Hey, how's the kid's leg? I mean it's been four days, he couldn't call me? He's weary at home, but you know he doesn't talk. His leg seems to be getting better. Go up and talk to him. No. If I go up there, he's just gonna piss me off. But you should be the one to convince him to make this trip. I'll try. And maybe we should make a little trip. Thanks for everything, Leo. Ah... I have decided to take the simplest approach to life of all, the simplest and best. I've decided to excel in everything. No, no, don't let me do that again, a little further back. My mind's blowing up but dad, before we go on, there's something I want to talk to you about. Now if it's about that Mario character, I said all that I intend to. It's not just about him, it's about me and you, too. I miss you... But I miss him too. And I wanted to talk. Would you rather I discuss this with your secretary? Whatever you feel like. Great. You know you don't deserve to play Serrano. Serrano. No, look. This is our problem. Let's talk about it. We will, but not now. Please, Mario, I'm fine. Just pick me up after classes tomorrow, okay? Yeah, sure. What's going on? I'd rather tell you tomorrow, really. I have to go, I have to go. Bye-bye. Yeah, wait, wait, wait. Aw. [Laughs] Why are you so serious? Just terminal parenthood. Nikki, huh? Nikki. What? It seems that she's about to make a very big mistake in her life. I'm considering sending her to England. I don't want to, but whoa, that drastic, huh? Yeah, that drastic. She's checking up with cocky street kid from Italy. That's in healthy age. Physical affection. Huh? I hear that Italians are very good. Yeah, I suppose you mean in bed. I don't mean winning wars. Just relax. What are you are insatiable! Can't you think of anything else? No. Look, look pre Irene. Okay, for God's sake. What? The world does not revolve around orgasms. Well, perhaps not for Serrano! Oh, no wait a minute. Old sigh, the great satisfier? Been on a lot of trouble with that nose. Don't put it on then. Oh, now look. I'm trying to be serious. Alright, will you stop? Oh, I can't talk to you either. Either. Wait a minute. About the Italians... Did I ever tell you that my mother was born in Naples? Hmm... Too much light. Can you get up for a second? I want you to be comfortable. I feel fine. I feel great, okay? Shit. There's still too much light. Will you just relax? Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, don't be so tight. The more you forbid Nicole to see the boy, the more attractive he's gonna be if their background is at different level, let her see it. No. Who knows... Maybe he'll fit in. That's just exactly what I don't want him to do, fit in anywhere. I'm ready anytime you are. Ow. Stop being a baby. I haven't even started yet. Ow. What your ribs? Not exactly where are you going? You smell anything? Do you smell something burning? Can we concentrate on what we're doing, please? Whoa, shit. Oh, shit. Son of a bitch. All you had to do was say no. [Laughs] Come on. [Laughs] [Fire alarm rings] Hey, what happened? I want my money back, that's what happened. Look at this mess. Wait a minute. What do you punks been smoking? You're gonna pay me damages. Hey, you got your ass backwards, schmuck. Get in the car. Hey, you pay up or I'm gonna kick your ass. Don't make me laugh. Come on. Go. [Car engine] Don't every do that again. It worked, didn't it? I mean, the next shit! Where'd you learn to do that? Next time I tell you to get in the car, you get in the car, [Car engine] Music. Linda... We're throwing a little dinner party over the weekend, would you like to come? Love to. Good. Oh, and would you ask ah, Nikki, when you see her if she would like perhaps to invite that photographer friend of hers. Of course. I'll tell her when I see her. Good and ah, let me know if he can make it. What changed your mind and what about England? England's still there. You're still going, nothing's changed. Linda, you see what I mean? I wouldn't miss this for the world. Cold, no! Music. Your ex-boyfriend? [Motorcycle engine] What? You know something? What? I love you. Yeah? Why? Just because-- 'Coz why? Just because... Say it again. I love you. I look like shit. At least you're honest. This girl has become important to you, huh? Try this on before I iron it. Ma, you've got something to say, say it. You know, you're Italian. These people aren't like us. Her father is a famous man. She's spoiled. You're the one who said sex is everything. Hmm, love love is everything. Your camera payment is overdue. Are you gonna make it this month or am I? Hmm? I know, I know. In case of anything, don't worry about anything. Good, you got it, ma. How do I look, okay? Oh, you're marvelous. Thank you. Music. Don't be silly. I'm glad you talked to me. Thank you. Don't you think you should wait until your relationship's a bit more um... Settled before you move out? I never said I was gonna move out. All I want is the freedom to think for myself. Yeah, I can understand that. I think your father's concern is more with the fact that you're sleeping with him than anything else. Well, he should wait 'til I do so. That's for sure. What? I like your dress by the way. Oh. Can I borrow it sometime? Sure, anytime. Mr. Capone. Catone. Dinner is served. Hi. How are you? These are for you. Ah, good evening, Mario. Good evening, Mr. Yeats. I'm sorry I'm late. Ah, this is Mario Catone. Ah, Irine Deshaw, Catherine Charles-Mitchell, Laura Curt-Thompson. Oh, look at these. Oh, yeah, pretty nice. Ah, shall we shall we then. You look this good. Cute. Oh, Mario. This is my friend, Linda. Linda, this is Mario. Hi. Like I already know you. How did you manage to get into photography, Mario? From the bottom. It's a nice life. Do you freelance or work for a magazine? I work for an agency. It's hard work. Which one? Find photo. Never heard of it. Mr. Yeats has. You'll need a model. I'd be very flattered to pose for you. I'm afraid, you're gonna have to deal with me for that honor. Oh? Which photographers do you admire? Avidan, definitely. Ah, Helmut Newton sometimes. Hero. And Bruce Weber on a good day. Helmut Newton... Isn't he that pervert that takes pictures of naked weirdos? Kurt. Well, that's one opinion. Hmm, it's superb. What is it? From Mario's country. This is that album I was telling you about. Wanna hear it? We better go back down first, they're getting paranoid. Besides I want to go home. Why, are you tired? No, I'm not tired. I just want to get out of here. I want to say goodnight. I gotta go. It was nice meeting such a talented and a handsome young man. Thank you. Goodnight, Mario. Has anyone seen my father? I think you'll find that he's downstairs with the others. This is very beautiful. Who painted this? I can't quite remember, but he's important. Later go for less than $200,000. [Clock chimes] Jesus Christ. You know I have trouble shooting when there's an audience. Well, it's not my fault. My ex-wife... She's been quite... Thank God, we didn't last. I'd be up there, too. Oh, damn. Oh, that. That is kind. Here we go. Oh, okay. I just came to say goodnight. Thanks for dinner. Do you play, Mario? Well, it's been a while. Well, do you like a quick game before you go? Eight ball? Alright. I'll say good night then. Goodnight, Harriet. Like for break? No, no. You go ahead. There you go. This promises to be rather dull. Oh, damn. Oh, you're right, Mr. Yeats. This promises to be very dull. Eight in the corner. Bad luck. Where'd you learn to play like that? My father. Great game. Thanks. Was he a professional? My father was so crooked that when he died, they had to screw him into the ground. Goodnight. [Clock chimes] I know you really don't feel that way about your father. My father was a crook, so what? At least, he wasn't an asshole. Don't talk that way. Oh, I beg your pardon. Mario. Oh, shit. This whole goddamn evening was set up to make me look like a jerk, wasn't it? Wait, don't go, please? Can I at least have a hug? See you tomorrow. Drive you home? Can I have a cigarette? Sure. Music. [Party noise] Yeah, I've seen your picture in the paper the other day with ah what's her name, that actor's daughter. Nice to see you moving up a little. Cheers. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you have a head start? I'm not rolling tonight, brother just keep giving me. You're a hard man to reach. Hey, Veronica. How are you doing? Why don't you lighten up, alright? Hey, is there a problem? Just take her home, alright? She's ready. Why don't you stop trying to avoid me? Mind your own business. Hey, Mario. Take it easy, huh? This guy's a lunatic. You don't want to be here when he gets up. Veronica, get him out of here. I'd love to. What about the bitch who answered your phone the other day? Pull over. Pull over. Hey! I don't mean it. Go play with these. [Car engine] Let me tell you what we're trying to achieve here. I want the sensuality to be expressed through the face and the eyes... Not your body language. I think I know what you mean. Can we have some privacy? Yeah, sure. Take the dog for a walk, alright? Go get some coffee. Ready. That's good. That's better, right there, whoa! [Camera clicking] Come on let me see it in your eyes. Look at me. [Camera clicking] Pretty goddamn, good. Look... Last floor on the right. You'll hear the music. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, excuse me. Bye. Hello. What the hell do you think you're doing? Mr. Yeats, this is not what it seems. This is not what it seems. Would you listen? Just wait. Just wait a minute. Shut up. You'll see this for the last time. Goddamn it. Shit. Finished. Take her home, make sure she stays there and no phone calls. You're a damn crook just like your father. You know I'm sick and tired of your condescending bullshit. Get out of my house. Low life bastard-- like your father. Drop it. Mom, get him out-- shut up. Enough. Son of a bitch! Oh, Mr. Yeats, may I please have your autograph? [Crowd noise] There's nothing to explain. I saw it with my own eyes. He's simply taking advantage of her... Immaturity. If I may say so... I think your daughter is more mature than you're giving her credit for. Oh, and I'm to assume you approve of their being together? I don't know if they are in the sense that you mean, but I don't feel the right to decide anything for them. But they don't belong. I'm sorry. They don't belong together. Anyone can see that. Right now, the attraction is purely physical. Then why are you worried? You know one thing I've learned in life... It's not the things you do in life that you regret... It's what you don't do. Yes, I somehow knew you'd think that. What are you doing? Trying to convince my mother I'm garbage, huh? Go ahead. Your taxi's here. Here, old man, here. Have that film developed then you'll see what I was shooting. Your cab is here. Goodbye, Mrs. Catone. Goodbye, Mr. Yeats. One lady's death... The captain reached the hand of younger night. Oh me thinks, she hangs upon the cheek at night, like a rich Jewel in an east Ethiopia's beauty. What? To which for yours for earth, too dear. I can't believe it. It's alright. I need to talk, Nikki. I've behaved so stupidly. I was wrong. I was wrong because I should have not interfered. I should have realized what stage you were in, in your life, but I was I was right about one thing. I feel that I must warn you. Just think what happened between your mother and me. Dad, we were only shooting close ups. But Nikki, I still think you should consider going to England. If only to think things over. It's not just about Mario, I'm talking, I mean, other things, too. You see, you and he are rushing into this so fast and I know now that all you see is him and I understand that. I love him. I want to be with him now. Yeah. Then it's my fault. I'm such a damn fool after I had to hold onto you too much. You know, I'm just a silly old actor but a little out of step with today's world. It all seems too much to me and everything is coming so fast. I've lost your innocence. You're moving out. I'm not moving out. And I'm still a virgin, but I am in love with Mario and I do want to have a relationship. I'm sorry, Nikki. It's just that I love you. I'm rooting for you. You're the most important thing in my life. I came all prepared, but... Now I don't know where to start. I had a long talk with my father. Give me a chance to say-- go ahead. Get to the point. I kind of agree with my father that maybe we're rushing. Oh. I don't, ah huh. I don't know who to trust. Trust? You call me in the middle of the night to come down here to tell me that you don't trust me? Thank you. Just what I needed to hear. That's not what I said. You know goddamn well why this relationship has got nothing but problems. To your father, I'm a low life. It doesn't matter what I do or what I say, I don't stand a chance. And that's wrong. 'Coz I ain't garbage. You're wrong. Nicole, why don't you do me a favor, just get the hell out of my life. I can't take any more shit. Well, I thought I was worth more than that. You know, Mario? I'm really trying to give you support. Support, huh? You know what frustrates the hell out of me, who are you people to tell me what I can do and what I can't do? I don't-- who made me the bad guy? I mean what what did I do? What did I do? All I did was fall in love with a girl and that's it and everybody is like crucifying me. I have nothing to prove to anybody but myself, okay? Hey, come on. Shut up and mind your goddamn business. You know what it is? So, you're here, right? And I'm here.. And I'm- I'm trying to get here as fast as I can. What the fuck do you know about struggling? Everything is handed to you, everything. Give me a fucking break, alright? Don't talk to me like that. Oh, you don't like it? Tell you what you do, go back and babysit your father for the rest of your life. Yeah right. That's real good. Yeah! Shit! You love me? Tell me. There's too much light. How about some music? Music. Your appetite will come back, don't worry. I'm here if you need me. What time is your flight? Mom, that's the fifth time you asked me. It doesn't leave 'til tonight. Mom, I'm sorry. Jerk. Hey, hey. How long are you going away for? As long as it takes. Are you alright? Why are you so quiet? Why do you think? What's bothering you? Back to reality. You know, you're father's right. What could I offer you? You, that's all I want. You're not listening to what I'm saying. You don't understand I'm not working anymore. Well, you're talking but you're not saying anything. I don't know, I just got all this pressure on me, you know? What, so now I'm a burden? I just see things as they are. So, I'm gonna leave. Take care of yourself, alright? And uh... When I come back, we'll see. You don't have to leave. Mario, what are you saying? This is it? Come on. You coming or not? Come on. Come on. Okay, good, good. Here, take it. You could keep it. [Train noises] Music. [Whistles] [Door closes] I don't have a lot of time. We have a lot to talk about. Such a bastard. Unbelievable. I can't help it. Music. Captioned by: Gigecast
