Okay, good. Can you hear the waves? Can you hear the waves? Can you hear the breeze? You're at the sea. It's all good. Everything's calm. You can feel the breeze. That's good, that's good. The waves are coming in. You're at the beach. Everything's beautiful. Relax. You know there are whales older than Moby Dick? I mean older than when the book was written. The book was written and the whales are even older. Did you know that? - I didn't know that! - No? It's true. Okay, forget the fucking whales. You're... Fuck, you're... Okay, everybody fouls Ronaldo because he's the best and everyone wants to beat him. You're bleeding and they keep tackling, but you always get up again, Ira, because you're the best! You get tackled hard and you... Shut up! LOVE MOVIE (Arabic) The stars are dancing like crazy. You took a little too much MDMA. Try to relax. Everything will be okay. (Arabic) Relax, baby. Relax. You look like Alain Delon, and you look like Belmondo. No, it's the other way around, but whatever. It's really beautiful. It's so beautiful here. Aren't you a little too close to the fire? But your sunglasses are melting. I trashed a pair of sunglasses, too. With mosquito spray. Really? That's because of the DEET. - The what? - The DEET. The U.S. Army developed it to fight mosquitoes in the jungle. You look so beautiful. How old are you again? Who are you anyway? I'm Lenz. I'm Ira. WHO SHOT OSAMA BIN LADEN? OR: THE SUMMER OF LOVE Right after 9/11... really, just a few days later, they almost caught Osama Bin Laden. He was hiding out in some cave in Tora Bora. The Navy SEALS had him surrounded. But Osama managed to escape at the very last minute. Almost never to be seen again. - What are you doing? - I have to go. I've gotta work. - Where are you gonna work right now? - In Peshawar. Sure, Peshawar. Of all places? - It's complicated. - Come on, tell me. I do computer stuff. Are you really leaving? - Are you a hacker? - No! Then what's that? A bulletproof vest. - Put it on. - Then I can go? Yup. Come here. I have to go. Where do you want to go? Peshawar! What will you do there? I install encrypted VPN devices. (Persian) I love you. Really? - Lenzi. - Dad, what's up? Why don't you pick up on a Monday at 1pm? I'm busy with that board meeting. Oh, right. How could I forget? - You're really busy, aren't you? - Totally. I'll call your secretary next time. Good idea. I'm super busy. Yeah, wow! So, you need money? - Come on, Dad. - Okay. Have a nice Monday. - Talk to you next week. - I'll call you. Bye. Bye. I really thought it could go on forever. Kreuzberg, early May, early 30s... It's Monday and I can do what I want. Even nothing at all. Except there was Ira. In Peshawar. Seriously, Peshawar! Ira, the wrathful one. That's what it means in Latin. What? - The suitcase? - Yes. - We're together. - Yup. For the next wave. - We're just starting out. - We still have rose-coloured glasses on. "Rose-coloured glasses!" - What's there to laugh about? - You, lesbo. - Chill. - Okay, bunny. Hop off home! "Hop off?" I'll hop you right in the face! What the hell was that? Oh, another goal! Hey, Dad. What's up? You're at the office, right? Yup. Board meeting, where else? Straight ahead. A little left. Keep going straight. I'll tell you when. Straight ahead. Funny, huh? What can I say? It was beautiful. Ira was always away, but not for long. And it was summer, and it could have gone on forever. - You know when I have to work, right? - How should I know? - It's always early! - We were sleeping! - You've got my socks on again! - Leave me alone. Just go! - Fuck you! - Fuck yourself! Just go! There you are! - Tastes like toilet cleaner! - It's lime-pear. - Your mail. You coming home some time? - Yes, sure. - Where's your patient? - It's "client." Mr. Rothe. He's an artist. It's nothing serious. Couldn't finish his masterpiece. Kept painting over it. And then... Bang! Nervous breakdown, maybe psychosis. He'll be fine. This comforts him. Representational stuff. Three dimensional. Sort of like a reboot. Mr. Rothe? We're here if you need anything. Hello. Good to know. Good to know. So, how's your mildly unstable girlfriend? Excuse me? "Unstable"? - Isn't she with special forces? - No, Foreign Legion. - Or the secret service? - Yeah, Doctors Without Borders, CIA... I'm telling you, she's secret service. - No, she's in IT. She installs... - "Doctors Without Borders" sounds hot. Come on! She's gone, and that sucks. You love her! "Love? You love her?" You yokel! Mr. Rothe! Easy does it, Mr. Rothe. Kenn? Kenn? Can I borrow your car? ...claimed responsibility for the attack. Just this January a suicide bomber in Quetta blew himself up in front of a clinic, killing 15 people. - It's so cute! - What? - That you picked me up! - Of course! Get in! Where were you? Getting my bags. It took that long? Were you worried? - You were worried! - We're leaving! - Because of terrorism? - Leave me alone! - I waited for ages. - Careful! Watch out! I'm a really good driver. I told you, it's an office job. I sit in front of a computer. Last week I had to fix the phone of the Goethe-Institut director in Kabul so she could call her sweetie in Biberach. - VPN encrypted? - Of course VPN encrypted. It's not dangerous. Yeah, that Lion of Pan-thingy looks after you, right? Huh? Who? That dude with those eyes and that beard, that chin and hat, and that nose! Huh? That hipster in the photo next to your bed! Shah Massoud. The "Lion of Panjshir." - Lion! - Yes, "lion." How is he a lion? Because Massoud defended the Panjshir Valley like a lion. Back then, when they attacked, Shah Massoud stood there like a lion, like the king of the jungle, and defended the place. - Why are you laughing? - It's ridiculous. It's not ridiculous! - That's not really my thing. - What? - No? - No. Okay. Well... - Now tell me where we're going. - No, it's a surprise. Fine. Back then, the Russians attacked Panjshir with helicopters, again and again. But Massoud got some bazookas and shot the helicopters down. Just like in Rambo III. You have to give him that. Massoud was a hero. THE LION OF BRANDENBURG OR: HOW I NEARLY BECAME A HERO He really worked hard. And he was so hated. They kept trying to overthrow him, or kill him. There were 17 attempts on his life! They tried to kill him! But he was unflinching. He also had very loyal soldiers at his side. - Massoud is a hero. - Yeah. Wow. I also have a lighter. No, just get me some dry grass or something. Come on. No! Come on, go look! I need something dry to build the tinder bundle with. - Tinder-what? - Tinder bundle. "Tinder bundle." Lenz, everything's soaking wet. - Poplar seeds, birch bark, whatever! - Poplar seeds? Yes! Are you kidding me? What do they look like? Just look, please! Are you more of a... a gatherer or a hunter? I'm a boy scout. I see. Ira? Ira? - Why didn't you say something? - I was listening to music. Fuck! - Did I scare you, or what? - Yeah, of course! - Here, I brought you something. - What? Birch bark! Thanks! You made a real fire, little boy scout. Nice, huh? - Must have been hard with the wet grass. - Damn right it was. - Say something. - I'm sorry. - You were scared the whole time? - I wasn't scared. - No? - No, it's not that. - I just didn't know where you were. - Walking. It'll keep us warm the whole night. It is a little creepy. (Persian) I will protect you, my angel. Really? That's cute. From who? They say wolves have returned to Brandenburg. Aren't you afraid in Afghanistan? In those... - crisis zones? - Sometimes, yeah. What do your parents say? You do realize I'm an adult, right? Yeah, but still. My mother doesn't really want to know. She's more of a... - hippie-type. - And your father? I don't know my birth father. - You don't know who your father is? - No. I don't think my mum knows either. - Really? - Yes, really. Probably one of the naked dudes. I don't get it. One of those guys. They all fucked around. - Walked around naked... - What's it like without a dad? No idea. What's it like with one? Great. - And you? - What? Do you have a story like that? Something that traumatized you? Come on. Anything. No idea, really. I don't have anything like that. Nope. Once during a class trip "cool Henning" took my monkey. - A stuffed animal? - Yeah, my favourite. He kept saying: "Monkey, monkey, monkey!" And I... I got homesick. Then they had to... Well, my father picked me up. All the others were watching. In front of everyone, four days early. It was so embarrassing. The whole time: "Monkey, monkey, monkey!" He always picked me up when there was a problem. Your dad really loves you, huh? Yeah, he's bananas about me. Say "VPN encrypted" again. VPN encrypted. V- P-N- encrypted. - I told you I was a good driver. - Oh, yeah? You just have to go really fast. - Never slow down. - Yeah. Don't stop. Always downshift. - Where are we? - I have no idea. - Oh shit! - Lenz! Don't slow down! Faster! Hit the gas! - Did you see how I did that? - Yeah! Silky smooth shifting! - So, left or right? - Right. I love you! - Do you want to have kids? - Yeah, of course. I'm almost 70, you know? Maybe it's time to think about... having some. Excuse me? What? Well it's definitely too early for me. I'm not getting any younger. I'm not ready. There's so much I want to do. Yeah? Like what? Do a pilgrimage? Go back to school? No idea! I can imagine having kids someday, but not now! More like Dad. He was retired and had time for me. You have tons of time, too. That's different. - How is it any different? - Okay, but... - Fuck you. - Ira, come on. Remember that airplane that disappeared? From Malaysian Airlines? One theory is that everyone on board passed out due to a cabin pressure drop. And you feel like the people on that fucking plane or what? And this "fucking plane" kept flying on autopilot. - You know what I mean? - Of course I do! - I'm not retarded! - Imagine if someone woke up. Come up front, before I punch you in the face. Airplanes always fly from way point to way point and they have bizarre names like MEKAR, VAMPI, or NILAM. Somewhere between MEKAR and NILAM, MH370 vanished from the radar. But that's not where it crashed. They searched. It wasn't there. It's possible that the pilot shut off the transponder because he wanted to disappear or god knows why. MH 370 OR: HOW I TRIED TO DISAPPEAR Look, Ira. I'm going home. I'm out of clothes. What do you mean, you're out of clothes? - What a lame excuse. - What? I... You live at my place. You have stuff there. I know, but I... - You poor thing. - What? Lenzi ran out of clothes! Poor little guy. Did I catch you off guard? It's awful, right? I'm just saying... Whatever! It's bullshit! "I've got nothing to wear." - What the fuck? - Ira... What? I'm not sticking you with a kid. It was just a question. A shitty question! I hardly know you. What? Yeah! - I need the car keys. The keys! - What? Now I get it! Lenzi got homesick. Should Daddy come and pick you up? You can be so ugly. Yeah, I can. Asshole. The keys! Tourist fuck! What are you doing here? What do you mean? I live here. I rented out your room. I thought you were gone. What? To the Spice Girls, or what? Yeah. You were always at Ira's. I put it online. 800 bucks a week! - 800? - Yeah, they'll pay anything. Right. Just sleep on the sofa, okay? And the Spice Girls are Britain. British. Brits. Whatever. We're going sightseeing. Are you in? I was mad, okay? Ira was like World War II. Only worse. I love Ira. I even said it! And what does she do? She ruins it! Kids? Yeah right! We might as well move to East Germany or the suburbs! No way! 7,000 soldiers are buried there. Russians ones. It feels like a park for BBQs or skateboarding. But no, it's a mass grave! The total GDP is 2.5 trillion! And customer spending... - CR7 has 120 million Facebook followers. - Who? What? Cristiano Ronaldo. That's crazy! So 2.5 million... No. 2.5 trillion gross national product. And... consumer spending is 1.8 trillion euros! - Yes! - Apostle Paul said: "He who does not work, does not eat." We don't work for ourselves anymore. We work for others. That's consumer society. The collision of the cruise ship Costa Concordia off Giglio Island resulted in a total of 32 fatalities, 12 of whom were German. Radio transmissions between Captain Francesco Schettino and the port master revealed that the captain immediately disembarked, leaving the passengers to their fate. Schettino has been turned over to the authorities... So, did everything work out with your secret agent? Yup. I like Ira. Even if she's a bit unstable. Dude, she wants kids! That's life. What? I'm not as old as you! You're only three years younger, and Lilly is nine! Quit slurring! You had her when you were 14 and now you're separated. Wow! But I get along great with her mother. It's my daughter's. Why not? Here, I've got it! Check this out. Herbert Grönemeyer. Best hit ever. Men take you in their arms Men give security Men cry in secret Men need a lot of tenderness Men are so sensitive Men are simply irreplaceable Men buy women Men are always under pressure Men flirt like crazy Men lie on the telephone Men are always prepared Men corrupt with their money and coolness Men have it hard but take it easy A hard shell but soft on the inside Bred to be a man even as a child... (Italian) Oh, what a relief! We salute the island, and then... Don't be an idiot! The people on the island, of course. That girl out there. What do you want? You have to take some initiative, Lenze! Lenz. Right, Lenze, Lenze. You have to give women a reason to look up to you. "Yes, I want a child!" OR: "NO, I DON'T WANT A CHILD!" What's all this "mimimi"? Yeah. I'll tell you what it means to be a captain. I open a bottle of champagne, navigate alongside the island, wave... And then I bury my face in her beautiful tits! That's love. And we are men. THE CAPITANO OR: 60,000 TONS OF GUILT It was the night Captain Schettino sank the Costa Concordia. And they really did warn the Capitano: "Don't go too close to shore." But no. Big show-off, hard to starboard... And bang! Ship ran aground. Then he claimed he "accidentally" got into the lifeboat and couldn't get back on board. Yeah, right. As if! (Italian) Go back on board! Why did you abandon ship? I am in command now. Get back on board. Confirm! (Italian) Get on board, idiot. (Italian) Commander, please. No "please!" Get back on board! Confirm that you are getting back on board. I'm here on the lifeboat. What are you doing there, Captain? Speak louder. Are you refusing to get back on board? You must understand. It's dark and I can't see. So? Do you want to go back home, Schettino? In the dark! Do you want to go back home? Lenz? Lenz? Come on, Lenz, please. In the kid's room! Wake up. Lenz, get up, please. Lenz, please get up. Come on. Come on, we're late. We have to go. Lenz. - You have to get up. - No way. I can't. Imagine her reaction if we don't show up. - Lilly's been rehearsing forever. - I don't want to. - You promised her. - But I don't want to! Yeah, well, wanting is so 90's. We're late, come on. Where are my keys? Lenz, move it! Look how merry they are Flitting around so mirthfully Blackbird, thrush, finch and starling All the birds so darling Wishing you a cheerful year Full of glee and blessings The message they bring us We take to heart We all want to be merry As merry as those tiny birds Here and there in fields and dales Singing and dancing playfully Look at our little girl! She looks just like you. It's the middle of August and they're singing "The Birds Have Come Again"? That's a spring song. It was scheduled for Easter, but they weren't ready yet. - You need money, Lenzi? - Come on, Dad. Your brother flew halfway round the world. I thought he'd come back with a hot-blooded Latina. You know the kind... Fiery! With a fantastic figure, and a head full of curls! Your brother! With his paycheck, his looks, he could've done better! Shit! Or younger, at least! She's four years younger than Arndt. What's up with you? How's it going with the ladies? - Where's your old broad? - Put your seat belt on, please! It looks so good on you. Not like your baggy pants. - Really handsome. - Okay. Put your seat belt on, Dad. Look at how your brother drives! Yup. Now put your seat belt on. And it's going to be a boy! - That's out of anyone's control. - I would've liked a girl. (Spanish) Don Lenz, Man of Honor, bank director... And you, Signora Irene. Teacher... You, a banker. Mum, a teacher. She never had to work. I was against it. My wife doesn't need to work. There he goes again with his nonsense... Everything's as it should be... Be quiet you two. "Anonymous." Hello? Ira? FALL OR: HOW I WAS ALWAYS REALLY CAREFUL Henning tormented me forever with that monkey thing. It went on for weeks The whole school knew about it. Everybody yelling "Monkey! Monkey!" It just went on and on. But then, from one day to the next, he was suddenly super nice. - Did you come? - Yes. I thought that's how it is. You have problems, then they vanish. Later Henning told me my father had talked with his mother. Super embarrassing! And Ira? One call, and everything's fine again. And it'll stay that way. Everything's perfect. No problems. Oh, no! Lenz! Hey Lenz! I told you not to wear my socks. Lenz. Oh, not now! Your dad... Pick up, it's Monday. No, I don't want to answer. I want to make out. Come here. Where are you? I have to go. - I have to go. - You get up now, too! - No! - It's not fair. Kiss. Oh, Dad! Isn't that pretty! Thanks. You moving in with her? What? No, I'm not moving in! It's just great with her right now. - And no kid-talk. - What does that mean? My girlfriend and I stopped talking about having kids. - Is your girlfriend the one with the eyes? - No, that was Cara. - And what's with Cara? - Nothing at all. That was just sex. - We're really late. Come on, sweetie. - See you. Come on! Dad! Mum? What are you doing at Dad's? It was that day in August that was super hot. Over 80 degrees. Everything's so overripe and dark green... Just on the edge of going bad. But what you don't realize is that it's the last day of summer. - Are you really okay? - Yes! Yeah, my father fell. Badly? I don't think so. But somehow I feel like I've neglected him. I need to visit him again soon. How about now? - Now? - We'll drive there and visit him. Why not? It would be fun. No, it wouldn't be fun. Then he has visitors. He'd be happy to see you. He's hurt. Then I'll drive there. - Really? - Yeah, really! My father was really old. So old that he was even in the war! With "Heimatflak," Hitler Youth, and all that shit. He was 19 when the Americans took him prisoner. It was the first time he'd ever seen a black man! He still smokes Lucky Strikes. They were so cool, the Americans. When I was 19, things were a little different. First I think I'll travel the world. Or study something. - I'll do an internship at an ad agency. - An ad agency? Nice. But first I'm gonna party. Yeah, man, first get totally trashed. How old was your ex-girlfriend again? 27? Huh? Why? - 24? - Does it matter? - Tell me. - 23. - 23? - Yup. And your father felt that was too old? Hey, my father is 85! He's an old man. That was another generation. He says things like: "Lenzi, find yourself a nice 20-year-old with long legs who looks up to you. Someone supple." - It sounds like you agree with him. - I don't agree with him. But you had a 23-year-old girlfriend. I thought you were kidding, but he's really like that? Yes... No! He's just an old man. Are you scared, or what? Pull over, I have to pee. What? Hey, Lenz, what's worse? My tattoos or that I'm such an old hag? For your father, I mean. Neither. - Both are cool? - Yes. - That's good. - Totally fine. I almost put on a jacket so he wouldn't see the tattoos. - I thought it would help. - Stop it! You're so uncomfortable going there with me. - No! I'm happy about it! - You are! - I embarrass you. - You don't embarrass me! Why? Six. - Let's go. - Yup. Come on, let's go. - Come on. - Yup. Fuck, I'm scared! Seriously! I'm a fucking wimp! That's so fucked up! I'm pregnant. No! Lenzi! Son of a bitch. You could've at least called. Yeah, Dad, this is Ira. Well, sit down. Ira. Lenz. Let me see your tattoos. I imagined it would be worse. Back then... only sailors and criminals had tattoos. You've got quite a figure. I have to say. Not perfect, but... but all the more interesting. I, um... I'd like to paint you. Especially that nose. I'll get some towels. What took you so long? You're missing everything. - We're already on first-name basis. - Dad, how are you feeling? Fine. Strong as an ox. I was starting to think you'd forgotten your old dad. - And how are you? - I'm good, too. That's good. So, are you wrathful, Ira? - We have to go. - What? But you just got here. Yeah, but tomorrow is Monday. I have to work. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Bye, Dad. Bye. Lenzi? - Goodbye. - Bye. Thanks for the sausage. Would you rather have triplets or one retarded kid? That's not funny. Lenz... - Lenzi? - Yeah, when did it happen? I was always super careful. How should I know? You know pulling out isn't exactly the safest method, right? There are safe days, and not so safe days. You know that, right? - When are the safe days? - When? No idea! - See, you don't know! - What do you want from me! Pull over, I have to pee. The highest decoration in the U.S. Forces is the Medal of Honor. Not the computer game. For distinguished bravery and courage above and beyond the call of duty in combat against the enemy. What the fuck? Heroes! What good is it to be a hero? Lenze? You understand me, right? Seriously? 300 euros in cash! You're out of your mind! - How much do I owe you? - 258, please. 258 euros! Let's see if I even have that much. What's going on, anyway? Ira is pregnant. Oh, Lenzi! No! It wasn't planned. Not planned! You weren't even wanted. What do you mean, I wasn't wanted? Your father didn't want another child. So I helped it along a bit. You don't have any cash? No. Does Anna know? Of course. Your sister's not as sensitive as you. - Anna knows and she doesn't mind? - Nope. But we're not even together anymore. Keep the change. Goodnight. - Lenz? - Yeah? I could just cry! Your generation is ridiculous. "Not together anymore." Awesome. Your father and I divorced 15 years ago, did you notice? - Yeah, and now he's a lonely old man. - Nobody forced him back then. - Come inside. - No. Nobody forced you either. Come on. What will you name the child? - I don't want it! - Pull yourself together. That's a nice name, "I don't want it." It sounds... Flemish? - You need money? - Why do you all want to give me money? Do you need love? Yes! MONKEY LOVE OR: THE BIG ANYWAY You can't look them in the eye. You make yourself small. Duck. Never look them in the eye. If you want to calm them, go like this: What's wrong? Ira's pregnant. Isn't he beautiful? I've been trying for so long. He just ignores me. I don't get it. He was crazy about me. He used to love me so much. Fine. And then Kenn's patient, I mean client, falls in love with the gorilla. A real crush, with butterflies. She's totally obsessed. Real life monkey love. And the ape totally puts up with it. He really likes how she adores him. But then, literally from one day to the next, he brushes her off, doesn't care about her anymore and gives her the cold shoulder. That's just how it goes. Sound. Check! Camera rolling. And... Action! Great close-up of the leading actor. Or leading actress? We'll find out in the sequel in four weeks. Here's the head. The body. And... the legs. Lenz made no contact for six weeks. No phone call, no text, nothing! Then he suddenly shows up, and follows me around all day. "Ira, I love you! Ira, I finally get it!" Lenz is the slowest man on earth. Always too late. Always! Emotionally, I mean. I was at the zoo with Kenn and his patient. - You mean "client." - Right, client. This client thinks she and this gorilla are a couple. But the gorilla used to be in a Munich zoo. And the patient, I mean client, used to visit him there, too. Then, one day, the gorilla climbed over the fence, went over to the woman, picked her up and ran off with her. He carried her to the zoo restaurant and dropped her there... You listening? He dropped the lady there and... - And started biting her, like... - 2.80? - Do you have 20 cents? - He bit her like some mating ritual. She got hurt so bad she had to go to the hospital. So they sent the gorilla to Berlin. I mean to the zoo. And then the woman... After she left the hospital, she moved to Berlin, too, just so she could be with him! Another 20. Crazy, right? Why are you telling me this? I don't know. It's quite a story, right? It's a totally ridiculous story. Bye. Well... That was the year with Bin Laden and the cruise ship. And all the other stuff that happened. There was that plane that crashed, or disappeared with all the passengers. It just vanished! Gone! They searched for months. But found nothing. And it was the summer Lenzi's father died. Just like that. Well... You're old and then you die. - Who was that? - Henning. - Henning? - You know, "Monkey!" - Monkey! - Monkey! What did you inherit? This car here. Nice car. Come on. Give me your hand! Everything looks good. Ouch! Fuck! My nose! It's okay, it's okay! Relax. We can see the hair already! Let it come. Look! Look back here! Here! Look! It's a girl, Lenzi! - Crazy! - Totally! Watching a baby is like watching a bonfire. Where's the fucking taxi? - You told it to come here? - Yes! Totally snoozing. Here we go. - How does this work? - I'll get in, you pass it over. Yeah, okay. - Careful. - Got it? Yup.
