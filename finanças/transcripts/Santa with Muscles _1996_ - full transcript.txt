Dear Santa, how are you? I'm not doing so well. There's this really, really bad man named Ebner Frost who lives up on the hill. He's got these weird people working for him, and I think they're gonna do something really bad this Christmas. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. I don't want anything for me this Christmas, Santa, but things have been kind of hard for my friends and the people in my town. Mr. Frost and his men have been real bullies to everyone in Lakeville. That's where I live. We used to be a happy town, but now people are moving away 'cause Mr. Frost has been so mean to them. And now he's trying to take our Orphanage away from us and nobody can stop him! It might not be much, but it's the only home we know. I know you're really busy this time of year, but I just thought that since you're going to be in the neighborhood anyway, maybe you could stop by a little early this year and help us. If Rudolph or your other reindeer aren't ready, you could take a car or a bike or.. Hey, you, come back here! That's our Christmas Tree! Hey, come back here! I'm afraid that, with the way things are going, this might be the last Christmas I spend with my friends. I know it's only a few days until Christmas, but please hurry. Yours truly, Elizabeth Bentley Walsh. P.S., I hope you're really out there, Santa. Never stop to smell the roses! Aaaaah! Aah! Ha ha. Free omelet. Very nice. Aah! Time. Four minutes... 23 seconds. Robe. How did I do? Oh, great! Wonderful, Boss! Tremendous. Magnificent! You're the best. Weasels. If you guys are bucking for a Christmas bonus, forget it. 4:23? You call that exercise? Better cut down on my cholesterol. Yes, Sir. Oh... Make a note, Chas. My picture on the can isn't big enough. And have then make me more tan. Yes? Of course. Straightaway. You guests have arrived, Sir. Figures. Business always calls when you're having fun. Hmm. That should be another one of Blake's Rules. Make a note, Chas. Make it rule number... What number are we up to now? 385. Right. Make it 386.. "Never mix business with pleasure." Ooh, I'm hot today! Better write that one down, Chas. The rules are important, Guys. What would we have without Blake's Rules, anyway? Fun. Chaos, Mr. Thorne. We would have chaos. Pierre, rule number 105. Yes, Sir! "Never give an inch, especially when you can take one." Franco, 91? "Never lend a hand. You might need it later." Which reminds me, Sir... One of those nonprofit organizations called inquiring about a Christmas Fundraiser they want to hold here at the mansion. After all, it is Christmas. Haven't you learned anything? If you give them a taste, they want more. If you want to do them a favor, send them some of those carbohydrate bars that aren't selling anyway, and Chas, don't forget.. To write it off, Sir. Good man, Chas. Okay, Guys, let's go kick some paintball butt. Let's roll! We're outta here! Guys, let's hit it! All right! I'm gonna get him! Watch out! Blake, come on! They are gonna be history. Of course before the time limit runs out, but you still have to get the other team's flag. That about covers it. Ready? Ready? Never trust the enemy, Captain. Hey, that's not fair! Get him! Too rich and too quick. Boop boop boop boop. Boop boop boop boop ehhhnk! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo ehhhnk! Gotcha. Aah! Sheriff! I mean, Dispatch! We got massive guns out here on 43. It must be Militia or terrorists! Send everything you got! I'm rolling! Come on, Baby! Hey, why don't you just pull over? Rule number 20.. "Never Surrender." Besides, this is fun. Give me your paint gun. Sorry. Idiot. Hey. Hey! Watch it! Watch it! We'll lose them in Lakeville. There's a million places to hide. I grew up there. Do we have any news on Mr. Claus? No, but I got a midget in a clown suit. Great. Rule number 21: "When in doubt, get out." Later. Santa! Santa! Santa! Santa! Santa! No, don't worry about it. I raise you one king. How's it looking out there? Pretty bad? Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no problem. It's no problem. I just ran into a streak of bad luck, that's all. I'll have the money for you today, I promise. Uh... Listen up. I've got 50 bucks for the first elf that brings me Santa Claus. We can do that, huh? It appears my luck may have just changed. I'll call you. Receive payment from Lenny today, or cause mass hemorrhaging. Hi! I'm Dr. Blight, Mr. Frost's personal physician. Mr. Frost will be with you in just a moment. Comfortable? Get me out of here! Get me down! Anything I can get you? Coffee, tea, aspirin? Eh... Good. Enjoy! Hey, what are you doing? Let me down! Mr. Rapini, I'm Ebner Frost. I'm so glad you could make it. I do hope we can reach an agreement on the sale of your shoe store. I'm not selling my shoe store! Get me out of here! Where are you going? No! Don't leave me! Chump. How unfortunate. Well, since you're going to be hanging around a while, let me introduce you to my staff of scientists. Don't be disturbed by the fact they've been kicked out of some of the finest universities in the world. They've always just been a little ahead of their time... And the law. Allow me to introduce you to the world-renowned geologist, Mr. Flint. Nice to meet ya. You are going to make such an interesting fossil. Canadian chemist, Mr. Vial. Some find the scent of methane gas offensive, but I like to think of it as nature's perfume. The electrifyingly beautiful Ms. Watt. Ah! Spring! I'll give you all a chance to get acquainted. Did we look that way? I don't know where he went. I can't believe it. Come on! Let's try over here. Man! Oh, excuse me, Santa. You haven't seen some crazy guy in army fatigues come through here, have you? Well, no, Officer, nothing like that. Well, uh, keep your eyes peeled and Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho. Now, we know this joker is around here... Idiots. How do we find this guy? We gotta just throw a cover over this thing and smoke him out. Santa, I thought I missed you! Yeah. If you hurry, you still can. Do you have a minute? Fax me, you little brat. That's weird. Th-that's him. Freeze! Let's get him! All right, where'd he go, up the chimney? I think he's up in the air conditioning ducts. The ducts! Did you see the size of that guy? I think he went underneath the floors. The floor? This is a cement floor! Think, Barn! Oh, and your idea was better? Oh, yeah, sure. Somewhere. He can't just disappear. I'm not gonna be the one to tell the Chief we lost Santa. No. I'm not gonna let this guy get away with Santa fraud. Come on! Morons. Ho ho no! Another drunk Mall Santa. Well, you'll do. You're a big one, aren't you? Oh! Ho ho! Merry Christmas! Very Merry Christmas! I'm rich! And Mr. Frost won't pulverize me. And a snappy dresser, too. Why, don't mind if I do. Oh, answer to my prayers! Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Uh!!! Blake Thorne? Richest man... In ten states? Blake Thorne? Yeah! Whoo! I'm rich! I'm richer than rich! I'm too rich! Visa, Mastercard. American Express! A-whoo, a-whoo, a-whoo, a-whoo. Merry Christmas to all... And to all good night! Who are you? Lenny. How ya doing? I work here. Doing the elf thing, you know? Y-you okay? I think so. Uh... I was going to, uh... To the North Pole! Am I right? You know, the kids are waiting for you. I'll take you there. We'd better hurry. Otherwise, you're gonna be really late, Mr. Uh.. Mr. Uh.. you know, I didn't catch your name. You okay? I really don't remember. It's on the tip of my tongue. Uh... Santa! What? You're Santa Claus. Santa! No. Yes! No. Yes! No. Yes! Hello! Look at you. Come here. Come here. Look! Who else would you be? You got the little hat, you got the beard, you got the gloves. Hey, see? It's Christmastime. Come here to spread a little of that holiday cheer. Come on, Man. Uh, uh, I mean, Sir. We have a lot work to do. Santa? Are you sure? Hey, who's the one who got hit on the head, huh? Oh! Ooh, uh, sorry about that, Chief. Let's go. I'll explain it to you on the way. Work with me. Here we go. Nice and easy. Oh oh oh! Ah! All right, I got ya. Santa! Santa! Santa! Losers, Santa. Santa, losers. Aw, man! Oh, gee! Okay, Big Guy. Now, you're on. Now, remember to smile, say "Ho ho ho" a lot, and most importantly, promise them anything. It's showtime. Watch your head! Low ceiling coming out. They love you. Well, it's about time. Elf, take Santa to his throne! You're on. Santa, his first name. Who are you? David. You knew that. You been good this year? Yeah, sort of. And, uh, what's your name, little girl? Susan. And I want a Magic Mary Townhouse with a swimming pool, cars, and a horse stable. And a new makeup set and a CD Walkman because my best friend Kathy has one. And a new Barbie doll. And... Smile. Smile. You look beautiful today, little girl. What can Santa get you for Christmas? Um... Um, you know, one of those. Oh, a golf ball. No. Uh, pocketknife. No. Electric razor? No. Hmm. Smile. Let go! I was here first! No, you weren't! Santa! Get off me! Get the money. Go. Bye. Welcome, Mr. Thorne, to the United Banking System's Print-Secure Teller. Place your thumb on the scanner for fingerprint identification. Doh! No! No! I'm sorry, the user's thumbprint does not match Mr. Blake Thorne. I hate progress. No no no! How you doing? Little problem with the... Would you hurry up? My mom could've done this.. Give me a hand, Genius. This thing's heavy. Hello. Afternoon, Ladies. Crap! Move, you tool. Hurry up. Now, pick up as much as you can. What are you doing? We're Santa's Little Helpers, and we're gonna take this money to the Orphanage for him. Beat it, Kid. You are not! We are too! Get lost before we tell Santa you're a bad little girl. Santa!!! You be good. Santa'll be right back. Okay. Someone's been very naughty. What are you gonna do about it, Santa? Give me a lump of coal? Watch out! Santa, watch out! How about two lumps? Look, Santa's beating some guy up! Yay, Santa! Watch out, he's got a candy cane! Ow! You see, Kids? It pays to be nice. Anybody want to help Santa clean up? Yeah! That was very nice. And he could be very helpful. Hey, hey, hey! Good work, Boss. I knew you had it in you. You know, I was gonna help you, but I, uh, you know. Anyway, hey. If you could just come over here for just a minute, there's something I'd like to show you. The Mission. They need help, Lenny. We should go. Yeah, yeah, we, uh, we, uh, we should go there... Someday. But first.. We should go there. We should go right now. Excuse me. Pardon me. Got something nice for you. Come on, Santa. Go home! Don't you have parents? You know, you're absolutely right. The Mission could be kind of like your local office. L-let's get outta here. If I'm Santa, where's my sleigh? It's getting new brakes, and Rudolph's got this stomach thing. I got something better. Let's ride! Bye, Santa! Oh, did you see that? Ahem. Here's the file on the Rapini sale, Sir. Did you... Get these disinfected? Do you have any idea how many germs can fester on a piece of paper? I've a feeling this Rapini fellow's not going to sell. I'll sell! I'll sell! I'll sell! I'll sell! I'll sell! I knew we could work things out in an amicable manner. Oh, and remember to be out by Christmas. Thank you. Yes! Blight? Now our plans are almost complete. I still have one last headache. The Orphanage. Round up the troops and see if we can convince our little friends to adopt a new attitude. "Adopt!" That's a good one, Sir. Ahem. I'll just get the spray. You sure this scooter's gonna make it to the Orphanage? Doctor's note: Never let Flint drive. Good afternoon, Leslie. What do you want? Oh, we just dropped by to see how your relocation plans are going. Any way we can be of help? You're so full of it. Just leave us alone. Why don't you just disappear forever? We'll be around if you need us. Please, don't hesitate to call me. In your dreams. Come inside, children. Wow! What are you staring at? Get back to work. What's going on? Where is he going? Get the heck outta here! Where do you get off coming to our homeless shelter? Be careful, Clay! You better stop there, or you're gonna have to.. Come and get it! Don't! Oh! Why aren't we moving? Arrrh! Wow! Merry Christmas, Santa! It's, uh... Santa! Cool! Yeah. Let's go! Santa! Wow, that was awesome! How'd you do that? See, I told you Santa would answer my letter! Looks like we owe you a debt, Mr., uh... Ahem. Uh, I guess you can call me Santa. Well, the least we can do is offer you dinner. Do you have time? Yeah! Sure. They can't start Christmas without me. Can they? Santa, you saved my life, Man. I was a goner, Man. Santa, sit next to me! Here. I bet you had a long trip. Thank you, um... Elizabeth. I wrote you the letter. I guess you get a lot of letters. Uh, I think so. Wait right there! I'll be right back. You have to cut Elizabeth some slack.. She still believes in that stuff. She also believes in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny. My name is Sarah, and that's Taylor. Hey, Kid, how's it going? Lenny's my name. Hello, Santa. I'm Leslie Morgan. I run this place... Or at least I try to, anyway. Thank you for what you did. That was a very stupid thing you did out there, Santa, but I'm glad you did. Hey, if had been 20 years younger, I'd have done the same myself! Hey, look here. Leslie, she may run this place, but I'm the one who keeps it in one piece. Clayton is the name. Well, thanks, everybody. I'm really glad to be here. I'm really not sure why... But I saw the sign at the mall and for some reason I thought I might be needed here. Who were those guys, anyway? The scientists? Oh, they work for Mr. Frost. He's been clearing out the whole neighborhood, and no one knows why. Now he wants the Orphanage. And he'll get it, too. Shut up! He will not. Sounds like a very naughty boy. Oh! Oh ho ho, thank you! What's the matter, Santa? Don't you like chocolate chip? I don't think so. I mean, are these good for you with all the fat and... Santa, don't you remember you love cookies? Oh, yeah! Mrs. Claus has to hide them from him.. Otherwise, he blows up like a blimp. Ooh! Mm. Here, have some milk. Is this low-fat? Okay, everybody, let's set the table and wash. It's jerk chicken night! Yay! Whoo! Okay, everybody, let's march. Let's march. And the guy says... One of Santa's Helpers, and this guy's got a nose ring the size of a donut, you know what I'm saying? Oh! Hey, hey, I'm talking jelly-filled here! So Santa decides to give them both an aerial tour of the North Pole. Whee! Hey, uh, Santa, uh, do you have a place to stay tonight? Leslie, can we keep him, please? Elizabeth, he's not a dog. Ruff ruff! What about me? All right, all right, but they're not going to be able to stay for long, Elizabeth. Christmas is only three days away, and Santa's going to be very busy. Yay! Thank you, Leslie. Yeah, well, we're pretty much closed down, anyways. See, we found a home for all of the kids that we could. We're the leftovers. Santa, you take any one of those empty rooms, okay? I think it's time that I put the kids to bed. Good night. Good night. Thanks for dinner. For later. Good night, Santa. Come on, Elizabeth. Good night. Ahem. Santa! Hello! Santa! Big Red! Shall we? Nice jammies. Uh, I'm sorry about the pajamas, Santa, but that's all we had. They're gonna patch up your Santa outfit, and we're gonna have them both ready by tomorrow. Good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite. You look great. You look like a leftover from last year's Christmas play. Eee! Look at you. You look ridiculous. At least mine doesn't have a tail. Am I a sheep? Am I a bunny? Which one of these two things? Don't worry! You're Santa. Give it a rest, will ya? Thank you. Nighty-night. Good night, Santa. Just the way I like it. You know... Good morning, Santa! I saved you a seat over.. Santa! You forgot your, uh... Uh... Uh... You know, th-this is a-a very funny story. Santa? Uh, Mrs. Claus says it tickles, so I just wear it for deliveries. Ha ha! There it is. Oh, hey, Santa, look. Read the front page. Yeah, you're quite a hero, Santa. You know, Santa, I can't help thinking I know you from somewhere.. I-I mean, other than the mall. Delicious this way. Mm! Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Oh, you'll have to try it. Oh! That's the end of it. Sorry. Try the crunch berries. They're even better. Fantastic. Guess I'll just recycle this. Recycling, Kids. It's just the right thing to do. He's right. Welcome, Lenny, to the United Banking System's Print-Secure Teller. For $100 gazillion, please place your stolen thumbprint on the scanner. Thank you for doing business with us, and have a nice life in South America. Let me give you a hand. I... Always try and help people out as much as I can. Well, thank you. Hey, I'll wash, you dry. So, what are you gonna do now? Well, what do you think Santa would do? Well, I think Santa would do nice things, like helping people, spreading Christmas Spirit.. You know, following all the Santa Rules. Santa Rules? Of course! You know! Oh, I get it. It's a test! Okay, it's like this. There's are things you always do, and things you never do. But it's just that some people only follow those rules around Christmastime. You always help someone less fortunate than you. You never turn your back on someone in need. When in doubt, help out. And act the way you do at Christmas all year round. Hmm. Santa Rules. I like that. Bye, Santa. I fixed up your suit, Mr. Claus. It's pretty ripped up. I even made a few improvements. Improvements? Yeah. I gave it a more continental look. Wow! I shortened the sleeves to freedom of movement, I gave it a V-neck, and a utility belt for Super Santa! Wow! Do you like that? This is great, Sarah. Thanks. Where'd you learn to do this? Mega Man #96! Hoo hoo hoo! Cool duds, eh? Wait a minute, where are my threads? Keep your pants on, Q-Tip. I'm getting there. Jeez. Excuse me. Psst. No problem. I'll get it. Good morning. I'm Helen Chu with News 8. We heard that the, uh, Santa with muscles lives here and we wanted to do a big feature on him. Is he available? Uh, well, meet you in the courtyard in, uh, just a moment. By the way, how much do we get paid for this? Good morning, Lakeville. We've all heard the song "Santa Claus is coming to town." Well, Santa isn't coming. He's already here at the Lakeville Church of the Light Orphanage. This Santa With Muscles not only foiled a robbery at the Lakeville Mall yesterday, but he also thwarted vandals here at the Mission. Santa Claus, may we have a word, please? We're live on Channel 8. Welcome to Lakeville, Santa. So, tell us.. How did you get here? Uh... Uh... Um, well, uh... Rooster. Uh, sleigh? Reindeer! The reindeer brought me here. Of course, but, Santa, you look so much more healthy than you did last year. Tell us what's your secret. Uh... I love... To eat a lot of reindeer meat. Doh! Just kidding, Helen. Um, I just.. I try to laugh a lot every day. Heh! Ho ho ho. There's a new Santa in town, and I know if you've been naughty or nice... So be nice! Uh, S-Santa, thank you very much, but, uh, we.. We got a schedule to keep, and, gosh, you know how busy we are. Back to you, Helen. Ho ho ho! I'm Helen Chu, reporting from Lakeville Orphanage. Now back to you in the studio. Yes, thank you, Santa, for putting the Orphanage on the map! Let me ask you something, Dr. Blight. Does he remind you of anyone? Something about him seems familiar. Of course. I saw him last year at this time. And the year before that. You know what I'm talking about! Aah! I just can't put my finger on it yet, but I will. Yes! Ho ho ho ho ho! Ooh! Welcome, Mr. Thorne, to the United Banking System's Print-Secure Teller. Place your thumb on the scanner for fingerprint identification. You betcha! Oh, Leonard, you are a genius! I'm sorry, that is your right thumb. Please place your left thumb on the scanner. Hey, will you give me a sec? How ya doin'? Mr. Frost requests your presence. No problemo. I'll just, uh.. Now, Lenny. Now's good. Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Easy with the jacket! Into the van, Elf Boy. Whoa! Ooh! What do you think you're doing? Mr. Frost! Pleasure to see you, Sir. I was just working on repaying that loan. You're making trouble for me, you little worm. The last thing I need is anyone drumming up support for that Orphanage. I want that Santa With Muscles outta there. Am I coming in clearly?! We have a very good connection, Sir. I understand every word. No more talk! In the North Pole. I just want him gone. Dump him. Well, Mr. C., time for us to push on. What about your scooter? Oh, it's, uh, better now. Isn't that the darndest thing? Besides, can't have you spending all your Christmas Cheer in one place. Have to spread it around, you know? Hop on. Good Santa. Attaboy. I'm not leaving. What? They still need me here. I'm dead. ♪ For all of time ♪ Angel Baby ♪ You're so fine ♪ Angel Baby ♪ Mine for all of time ♪ Angel Baby ♪ I remember that song. I know it's not the kind of song I'm supposed to sing here, but I think my mom sang it to me. If I sing it just right, I might be able to wake up the fairies in the window. Fairies? Leslie says the church has magic windows. People use to come from all over to see them work. Nobody comes anymore, though. I used to think that when they lit up, it meant my mom was listening. Does Santa have a mommy and daddy? I must, but... I-I don't remember. I don't remember my parents, either. Itchy? Why not take it off? You don't mind? Even if you don't have a beard, you'd still be Santa, right? Let's try that song again. Do you know it? Start me off. ♪ I'll always remember ♪ The time I spent with you ♪ November, December ♪ April, May, and June ♪ You were my Angel Baby ♪ You're so fine ♪ Angel Baby ♪ Mine for all of time ♪ All time ♪ Wow!

You finally made something of yourself, after all. Hey! What happened? Where did it come from? It's our statue head. Oh, I bet you it was... No! Come on.. Please don't. They're not after you. Never turn your back on someone in need. A friend of mine once told me that. Keep the milk and cookies warm. Sarah, come on. I thought it was Christmas, not Halloween. Why don't you go Trick-Or-Treat somewhere else, Doctor? Certainly, Santa. After you. Shouldn't you be back in the North Pole around now? I strongly suggest that you return to your next of kin. This is my family. Very well. Oh, what the heck. I'll wing it. Patient: Santa Claus. Complaint: Mm... Blurry vision. Reflexes... Jeez! Beautiful thing. Do you have the keys? Patient suffers from bad tummy aches... Ooh! And splitting headaches. Take one of these in the morning. And get plenty of bed rest. Whoo! Yes! Santa! Whoo-hoo! Way to go! Way to go! You know, I was gonna help You but the, uh, door kind of stuck. Wow, the way you give him that.. Ba-bing! Ba-bing! Come on. Come on. You know, maybe the man is right. Maybe it's time you, uh, did head back home. Yeah. Tomorrow's Christmas. Don't you have to go back to the North Pole? I'm not going anywhere. I'm not gonna let anyone steal our Christmas. Hey, Guys, where's Taylor? Oh, yeah. Huh? Uh, yeah... Taylor! Come on out of there wherever you are. Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor, this isn't funny. We're not kidding. I think I know where he is. Well, Mr. C. How we supposed to get over this, fly on one of your reindeer, hmm? Aah! Was that necessary? Okay, okay. Shut up. Let's go. Aw, boy. I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here. Just remember, when Christmas Day rolls around, I expect a little something extra.. You didn't square the denominator! If you quantify that data, you'll see.. You're wrong. It'll never work. But I found the formula for pain! What are you trying to do, smother me? I have a very delicate metabolism, you know! Okay. Sir, you could leave the mansion from time to time. It'd made things a lot easier. Germs have been hovering around me my whole life! No, no, no! I don't want to... This is naughty. But he's even worse. That doesn't make it right. I was only trying to be like you, protecting all of us. I did what I had to in self-defense, Taylor. I'm only tough when I have to be. Is that a Santa Rule? It's my rule. Come on. Look. Something's going on. Not by video. I'm going to be involved this time. We're here already, so let's at least check it out. Lenny, go with Taylor back to the bikes. I'll take a look. Aw, come on. That's the most sense I heard anybody make all night. Come on, Kid. Did I ever tell you about the time Santa and I fought those two guys at the mall? Forget about it, my little friend. Stop! I'm trying to take your blood pressure. Well, then, take it! A little thing we call a phobia. Oh, you presume... That's in your head! It's in your head, Sir. Are you listening to me? Now that I own all of Lakeville, I can begin excavation immediately. I've been waiting a long time for this. I want what is due me, and I want it now. Yes, but, Sir, aren't you forgetting one minor detail? I want that Orphanage cleared before the last Christmas Turkey is sliced. Do you understand me, Doctor? Sir, your blood pressure. So, what's under the Orphanage? Water and power lines. Telephone cables. Sewer. Rats. Big, ugly rats. The clubhouse. Clubhouse? Oh, the old catacombs underneath the church. Yeah, the kids use it as a clubhouse. And there's a big vault door down there. A vault. Now, Kids, we're gonna find out what Frost wants. Clayton, what's in that vault down there? I don't know. I don't think it's been open in all the years I've been here. We know the combination. Well, some of it. Yeah, it's gross and creepy, just like now. Oh, shut up. Here we go. Be careful. Watch your step. It's very dark. Kids, don't get too far ahead. Scary. Look at those spider webs! So, how far did you get with the combination. Not that far. Three numbers. I'll show you. This one's eight. The second number is... 24. Next. And the third one is... 16. That's as far as we've gotten. Eight, 24, 16. That's right. What is he doing? h, my god! Whoa whoa whoa! Oh, my god! Looks okay. I'll lead. Slow down. It's beautiful. Wow. Clayton... It's everywhere! This has been underneath us the whole time. These are what must make the church windows glow. These are the fairies? Unbelievable. It's warm. Oh, put that down, Honey. You don't know where it's been. Mom! Mom! Mom! Hey, Guys, I know what these are. These are Piezoelectric Crystals.. I read about them in my geology book. They're Quartz Crystals with natural electricity in them. Vibrations make them put out power. They must be worth millions! Electricity? Taylor, put that down. Okay. Oh! Told you so. Everybody out, and watch your feet! You don't want to step on one of those. Watch your feet! You coming? In a minute. I just want to figure out how I opened the vault. Hey... You're Santa Claus. Come on, let's go. Then Dr. Blight was right. Why am I not at the North Pole, then, and how to all the kids in the world get their presents tomorrow? I don't think you want to ask too many questions. It only makes trouble. You're not... Buying the Santa thing, are you? All right, you want the truth? The truth is... You see this? You were wearing this when I found you. How'd you get blood on you? I don't know. I don't ask. You ask too many questions, maybe you find out you're a wanted criminal or something. Look, I don't have all the answers, but those kids, they need Santa Claus right now. Just be Santa. We'll figure out the rest later, all right? Thanks. Hey, that's what I'm here for. Just give me a couple more minutes. They're all yours. See you upstairs? Thank you. You got it. Yo, this is Lenny. Hello, Lenny. I'll pay you the money somehow, Mr. Frost, but please, I don't think it's right. I just.. I just can't. When I want your opinion, I'll have it surgically removed. Mr. Frost, they're keeping pretty close tabs on me. Then you'll have to be sneaky. You're very good at that, so listen to me, you pollutant. Okay. Hey! The lights are out. Aah! What is it? What happened? He's.. He's in there, and he's... Oh! I believe she's trying to say it's me. What are you looking at? Nothing. Think you're funny, don't you? You! Where did you.. But I thought that.. You guys okay? Yeah! You know, I have a Christmas Wish, Santa. Get out of my life! Damn! Ho ho ho. Afraid of heights, Santa? I can cure that. Cure this! Santa, you slay me. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Oh oh ohhhh! All right! There, I got my Christmas Wish! Oh! The picture's still not big enough. Oh, man. What a dream. Santa Claus... What a bonehead. Happy Christmas, Mr. Thorne. Did we have a good sleep? What happened? I was hoping you could Tell me, Sir. A gentleman... Waste disposal engineer, in fact, he caught sight of you in his dumpster and, recognizing you from your products, he fetched you back here... Wearing that. I was... Santa Claus. Leslie! The kids! Oh... Operator, connect me with the Lakeville Orphanage. Hello? Leslie, it's me, uh, Santa. What do you want? Huh? What do you mean? Are you and the kids okay? I remember Dr. Blight was there and Elizabeth screamed, and.. And I think I fell off the roof. I'm sorry I left you and the kids. You're so full of it. Just leave us alone. Why don't you just disappear forever? That takes care of Santa the clown. Assemble the team. We're taking the Orphanage now. And the question everyone is asking is "Where's Santa?" Lakeville's own Santa With Muscles has not been spotted since he foiled a purse-snatching yesterday. It's been wildly speculated that he's returned to the North Pole. Back to you in the studio and Merry Christmas. I'm not surprised. There's no such thing as Santa. Hey, little one. Maybe he did go back to the North Pole. Hello, Twinkle Toes. I could use some help in the kitchen. Who is that? It's okay! I don't know! Oh, no! Aah! Aah! It's all right, I'm here. Wait till Santa hears about this! He'll kick your butt to New Year's! Oh! Yeah! The field is sterilized, Sir. Merry Christmas to all. Gentlemen, bring the children. What do you want with us? With you, nothing. I want what's in your vault, What's under this whole neighborhood. You just happen to be in the way. Then let us go. Who's going to do my mining? Why, you son of a!!! Uh-uh-uh-uh. There are children present. Children... Hello, Children. I'd like you to do a favor for your Uncle Ebner. I'd like you to open that vault. We can't. We don't know anything. We're just kids. You help out your Uncle Ebner, and I'll give you some Christmas cookies, candy canes, and plum pudding. Yuck. Plum pudding? I tried. Prepare them for mining! No! Lenny! Oh, by the way, Lenny, I want to thank you for letting us in. I'm sure it was quite a sacrifice for you. Lenny? I thought you were a real elf! Take them away! Oh, my god. Benedict Arnold. I-I.. Can't believe you, traitor! You can open it, can't you? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Aah! Aah! Thanks, Pierre. Mon Dieu, I never seen the boss like this. He loves to hit me. Yeah. Santa, it's Lenny. Lenny! How are you? I tried to call, but.. Forget it, Big Guy. There's no time. Mr. Frost is trying to take over the Orphanage with his goon squad. He's got his pet scientists everywhere. He's trying to get in the vault, and when he does, he's gonna use the kids to mine the crystals. I don't know how long it's gonna be before.. Ow ow ow. How's my favorite patient? Remind me to prescribe something for that pounding headache you must have after that nasty fall! Remind me to introduce you to my two little friends, lefty and righty. Oh, save it, Santa. These long-distance phone calls from the North Pole must be getting pretty expensive, so I'll be brief. Step one foot onto this property and I'll use your friends in my next experiment. Until next year, Santa. Gentlemen, we have a mission. Yes. Aah! Mm-hmm. Tuck in that trowel. Very good, Sir. Pierre, put a shine on that garlic press, and clean up that lug wrench. Okay, mount up. Shotgun! I got... All right, men. Let's go spread a little Christmas Cheer. Tell Mr. Frost five minutes! Do you realize how fast you were going? Oh, no. No. Tougher. Tougher. Tougher. Hey! Turkey Breath, do you realize how fast you were going? The terrorists. Control!!! We have company, Sir. Just one? No problem. Hmm. More unexpected guests? We'll just have to handle it Blake's Way. Pierre? The first course, please. Let 'em try some of Blake's Way salad oil. No cholesterol. Only three calories per serving! And it goes down smooth. What the??? How 'bout some Blake's Way Protein Powder for our little friends? I was at Desert Storm, you know! I'm bad! I'm a heartbreaker! I'm a troublemaker! Whoo-hoo-hoo! That'll teach you to mess with Thomas P. Hinkley. Is surrender an option, Sir? What do you think, Chas? Blake's Rule 20, Sir, is never surrender. No! Which one of you turkeys is responsible for this? Not me. See you, suckers! Ha ha ha! You take it. Jumpstart. Chas, go to the back entrance. I'm gonna find the children and get the adults upstairs. What are you doing? Waving to Santa. Hi, Santa! Uhh! Get him! You guys okay? Yeah. You're not really Santa Claus, are you? No, I'm not. I just thought I was for a while. My name is Blake Thorne. You're not Santa. You're better. We have an operation to carry out. You guys with me? Yeah, of course! Where are the others? The science geeks took them upstairs. Okay, let's try to find them and let's stay together. Okay. Your weapon, Monsieur. Thanks. See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Hey! Hey! Whoa! No, no! Aah! Yeah, come on! Aah! Oh, whoa. Aah! Let's go find Leslie. Ho ho ho! Hey, where'd Blake go? Hello, Santa. I'm afraid I've been terribly, terribly naughty. No problemo. I haven't had a good workout in a week. In case you haven't noticed, the odds have changed. Wah! You wouldn't hit a woman. Would you? He wouldn't... But I would. Aah! Aah! Ouch. Lenny, great to see you. Thanks. No. Thank you, Mr. Thorne. It's all there. Well, except for a couple of bucks. Lenny! You're not gonna hug me or nothing, are you? Let's go find Leslie and Clayton, come on. All right. Well, all you had to do was knock. Are you okay? Are you okay? I am now. I'm Blake Thorne. Good to meet ya. Let's go. I've got to find The children. Uh, Blake, Blake. I'd like to talk to you a minute. Have a seat. Yeah. Have a seat. Hey, you lied to her. Blake Thorne? What's the matter. Blake Tarachefski doesn't fit on the bottle? How did you...? Isn't it coming back to you yet, Son? You grew up here! Look. Is that me? There's more. You see the boy sitting right next to you? He was your best friend. Ebner Frost. Aw! Do I have to do everything myself? Huh? Do I? "Yes, you do, Percy." "Why?" "'Cause you surround yourself with nincompoops like me." Gah! Wretched. Mother said there'd be nights like this. Nights like this! Hi! Just couldn't stay away from me, huh? That's okay, I.. I have that effect on women. So much has gone on. I'm so confused. Well, don't fret. It just so happens I'm a specialist in... Matters of the heart, too. Oh, are you really, Doctor? Well, maybe you can give me some advice. Why, Leslie. You certainly are a different person when you're away from those homeless little losers, aren't you? Listen, you pig! Nobody! Talks! About! My! Kids! That! Way! Whoa! Yeah! Yes! Hey, that's not funny! Great job! Now we've gotta get outta here. What about Blake? We're a team! Taylor! Let's go! Come on! Aah! Come back here, you little brats! I can't let you do this, Ebby. Ebby? What's wrong? Haven't heard that since we were kids? Blake! Blake Tarachefski. So, you're the one who's been causing all my pain? Maybe I have, but I'm gonna put a stop to all of this. Oh, you're going to stop me? You got it. I got it! Aah! Oh! It's beautiful! (Gibbering) Oh, whoa! Whoa! Yeehaw! These are good folks, Ebby. Leave 'em alone. You got a problem with me, let's take it outside. Would you shut up already? Don't flatter yourself. This is about money! Lots of money. What happened, Ebby? You used to be a good kid. Spare me the lecture. While you're off spending mommy and daddy's millions, I was rotting away in this place. I had to cheat and steal to claw my way out of here! While you're up in a mansion in a hill. Why don't you go back to your weight room and your tanning booth! Well, you know what? Being Santa opened my eyes. I didn't like what I saw. Oh! Uhh! Sarah! Elizabeth! Taylor! I was the one that should've been adopted. It's my turn! Well, now it's my turn to set you straight. Leslie! Too late! We're not kids anymore. Come on. Die! Die! Well, we can't just sit here! Come on! Stay here! I-I could do that. Ha! Ooh ooh! Yeah! Uh... What's happening? Rapid vibrations are causing an energy build-up. English, please. It's.. It's.. It's gonna blow! Let's get out of here! Let's go! Come on! Come on, Frost! Let it go! Move it! Oh, come on, Guys. Move, move, move! Come on. Get over here. Go on, move it. Push it. Don't look back. Come on, Frost. (Gibbering) Come on, Frost. Cool. No! All right! Everyone freeze! Good. Uh, Ma'am, please... Are we rolling? Hi, Helen Chu with News 8. Officer, please tell us how you finally apprehended Ebner Frost and his gang. Well, it wasn't easy, Helen. May I call you Helen? Got one more here. It took exhaustive investigative reporting. Excuse me, Helen Chu, News 8. Can you tell us who did this to you? Go away! I just want to ask a few questions, Sir. I guess he'll have a chance to De-Frost himself! I'll get you, Santa. Gonna get you, Santa. I'm gonna get!!! Hi, excuse me. Helen Chu of News 8. Just a couple of questions... Ew! Ugh! Were you responsible for the explosion earlier? Are you responsible... Oh! Ick! Oh, my sense of smell! You can't do this! It's inhuman! It's unethical! It.. It.. It stinks in here! I'm not through with you, Blake. I'm just get start.. Merry Christmas, Ebner! Well, you did an amazing job cleaning all that up, but where we gonna go now? I think I know a place that's available. Hey, watch it! I'm tanning! I'm tanning here! Hey! Slow down, boy! Duck, duck, goose! Blake, is it time? Yes! Come on, Guys! Come on! All right! What are you looking at? Move out of there. That's my trash! Lemme see, lemme see! Wow! A Christmas Miracle. I do believe in you. Blake. Ho ho ho! Yeah!
