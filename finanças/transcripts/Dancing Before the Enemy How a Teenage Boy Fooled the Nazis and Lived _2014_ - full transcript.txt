- Okay, all right. - Cheers, Dad. Cheers. Look in the eyes. Look in the eyes. Aah. It's a good potato vodka, that. So what do we have here? [Adam Bardach, voiceover] Growing up, we always celebrated Dad's birthday on May 7th, but that's not the real date. He was always known as Gene, but that's not his given name. Was our family Jewish? Until recently, I had no idea. In retrospect, I think my Dad had good reason to want to protect us from the truth of what happened. He carried it, or maybe buried it, for most of his life. What good would saddling his children with this burden do? In 2001 Dad was invited by his friend, Roman Polanski, to work on The Pianist. I think that the experience of revisiting the Occupation on film was cathartic for him. Slowly, he started to open up about the past. Maybe his story of survival wasn't a burden to be hidden, but a triumph to be shared. So I went to Poland, and together we drank some vodka and dusted off the old photos and memories. [Gene Gutowski, voiceover] I was born as Witold Bardach. Under the German occupation the Gestapo was looking all over the place for me. It was necessary for me to change my name. I was not even safe to get out on the street. It was then the Polish underground provided a set of documents, identities for me. I became Eugene Gutowski. [pleasant Polish song playing ♪] [Gutowski, voiceover] My families on both mother's and father's side, lived in Lwow. Lwow was a extraordinarily interesting city, a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Armenians. There were churches, synagogues of every religion. The architecture ranged from Renaissance to the... ...Viennese Secession as they used to call it, sort of a Viennese equivalent of French Belle Époque, and it was a highly, highly, enjoyable, pleasant place to live. I have some of my happiest memories of my childhood in that wonderful city. I was very, very close to my father, I admired him. He used to take me on Sundays, beautifully dressed in his grey flannels and a dark, uh, jacket and a Borsalino hat at a dashing angle, take me by the hand in my little sailor suit to the restaurant in Lwow which served the great Polish delicacy, flaczki or tripe, and I still have... ...the memory and the taste for that food to this day. The strong males in my family, whether it was my father or Uncle Bronislaw, even my Uncle Andrew left an impact on me, this desire... ...or the need to be elegant. And this probably has helped me survive the war. At no point, even at the worst moment of the Occupation, Soviet or German, was I ever unshaved, or not beautifully dressed, or what have you. Now come on now, what German would dare to kill such a nice looking, good smelling, elegant, young boy? They wouldn't dare that. Mother was a very beautiful lady, I mean gorgeous, in fact. She studied music... ...and wanted to make a career as a concert pianist. Every day, in the morning... ...there were sounds of... ...piano in our house, that was... ...part of everyday's background, was her practicing. [Film Narrator] Jews have lived in Lwow since the 14th century, 100 years after its establishment. During these centuries, they lived in two communities. One outside the city walls and one inside. The two communities suffered all the troubles that visited the city. Invasion by the Tatars, the Turks, the Sweeds, the Cossacks, and the great fires which burned down the city's wooden houses. [Gutowski] Both mother and father, though they were born Jewish, they're absolutely non-practicing. As I say, I've never took part in any holidays or-or didn't even know what they were. I was never inside of a synagogue, uh, though I used to go to churches quite a bit. It's a very difficult world to describe to-- particularly to people who only sort of think in terms of black and white, who don't understand the areas of greyness and maybe even look with contempt on people who totally assimilated, but that was the history of many Jews in Poland. They simply assimilated. The Jewish background became a liability only under the Nazi regime when they suddenly, with the Nuremberg laws, if you only had one grandparent, according to that, you were Jewish. And that suddenly made one realize, wait a minute... ...we're Jewish, or at least... ...we're looked upon by the Germans as being Jewish, though feeling that we had nothing to do with it, but I was wrong, of course we had something to do with it... We were one of them. Our charmed life came to a rapid end with an outbreak of war in 1939. [Newsreader] On September the first 1939, the Nazi army smashed into Poland. [Gutowski, voiceover] The defenses of Poland collapsed on the western front and the Germans were moving rapidly in our direction. We packed up things quickly from the house, taking all the wrong things and leaving all the valuables, and paintings and... ...furniture, and antiques because we had no idea, we were going to come back, we thought maybe oh, just only be a few days. You know, nobody had any imagination what it was going to be like. So we left, never to come back. The roads were packed with refugees. It was complete chaos and... ...frequently, German fighter planes would... ...swoop low and strafe, uh, the people on the road so many times we had to run, abandon the car and so on, or run into the ditches, run into the woods and they were simply strafing the civilians, leaving bodies. As we were heading for the Romanian border, in some little town not far from the border, a local official with two policemen, stopped the car and at the point of a gun, he requisitioned the car from us to put himself and his family and escape to Romania, leaving us on the road. So, in that respect, our fate was sealed then and there. [man speaking Russian] [Gutowski, voiceover] The Soviet army entered from the east, crossed the Polish borders, then to our great shock, the Bolshevik hordes were upon us. This was a result of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Act. Ostensibly, they were coming to... ...liberate the Polish peasants from the oppression of the land owner, which of course was a lot of bullshit, they just came to take over that part of Poland. This was totally, uh, a different crowd than one is used to seeing now. Russian millionaires dressed in Armanis and driving, uh, big foreign cars. No, these were the primitive, unwashed, part-Mongolian troops, for the first time encountering the West. Because for them, Poland was West. Subjected to years of Communist propaganda where people in the West were starving whereas they were living in a paradise. They were somewhat shocked to see exactly the opposite. That the shops were full of, uh, luxury goods and people are beautifully dressed and so on. [speaking Polish] [applause, cheering] [Gutowski, voiceover] My father was in jeopardy because he was a reserve officer, secondly, he was a lawyer. He's a man of culture, of education and so on. This was not what the new order was about. My mother's parents were property owners. They owned buildings, apartment buildings in the city of Lwow, until one day, people came to make them sign... ...papers allowing these properties to be nationalized. Overnight they became poor and owning absolutely nothing. So there was this continuous battle... ...of-of survival, under the Soviet Occupation. At this point, I sort of had enough of education. I felt it was getting me absolutely nowhere, so I managed to get myself into an art school. Under Communism, there are constant mass meetings, there are constant marches, there are constant demonstrations. They always carry banners, they always carry large pictures of the leaders, Lenin, was Stalin, was Marx, was Engels, was Voroshilov and Khrushchev even. So there was a tremendous demand for their large portraits. The students of the art schools were engaged to make these portraits and I managed to get into that group. Now... ...being the youngest... ...uh, they gave me something nobody wanted to do, which was Marx. Marx was particularly labor intensive because he had long, curly hair and a big beard. They were paying 30 Rubles per glorious leader, which was very good money in those days, but provided you could turn them out. So... ...after my unsuccessful life with Marx, I was managed, I don't know what I did, bribe somebody or something like that to allow me to do Lenin, and Lenin became my greatest friend because I could really, I could do him, I could do him, I could do him to this day, I can, with my eyes closed, I can paint Lenin. He had no hair, he was bald, he had a little hair on his side of his head, a little pointed beard, and a sort of Mongolian cheeks and Mongolian squinty eyes and he was glorious. I could knock out two of him in a night and I was rich. So... I must admit, I was a teenage purveyor of Communist propaganda. So, I don't know... ...if I'll ever have to be responsible for that, but I admit, I was. The lives under the Soviets, while it was not... ...pleasant or comfortable, it was not life threatening. The various nationalities were... ...jockeying for-for position. The Ukrainians, under the Russian occupation, uh, claiming that they were liberated by the Russians, again, everybody was being liberated by somebody. The Polish serfs were being liberated, Ukrainians were liberated, poor Jews were liberated... Nobody liberated me. [man speaking German] [Gutowski, voiceover] With the German surprise attack, the Soviets were in panic. They just didn't believe, or at least Stalin didn't believe until the last moment that that would ever happen. He thought he had established a relationship of friendship with the Nazis, with Hitler, but... ...it wasn't so. They were evacuating in a panic, in a hurry, and, uh, the Germans were advancing very rapidly so that Lwow was taken in a matter of days. [ambient music ♪] My family were quite foolish in their thinking, both my father and grandfather being German or... ...Austrian officers, they thought they had nothing to be afraid of, whereas they had more to be afraid of from the... ...from the Soviets. When the first German troops were riding into the city, they were Austrian troops, my grandfather was practically out in the street crying with joy. He thought, oh there's-- at last, these are, as he said, these are his boys, the Austrian soldiers. Well, little did he know that a year later, his boys would kill him. German officers, Wermacht or SS, came to my grandfather's house, looked over the apartment and... ...he was very proudly greeted him in German to tell him he was a colonel doctor in the Austrian army, show him his medals and decorations and so on. Well, they slapped him around, they broke up the... ...cabinet with the medals, called him a dirty Jew... ...and left. I felt terribly sorry for my grandfather, but I was also, you know... ...just frightened. The official orders and announcements concerning the Jewish population in particular were very quickly announced. The first order, they had to wear an armband. Immediately, I decided that... ...I didn't want to be a part of it. I didn't want to wear an armband, I just wouldn't wear an armband. I moved freely through the city. There was nothing in my looks, in my speech which in any way... ...would give away that I was a non-Aryan. My, by that time, fluent knowledge of the German language, which was very unique, uh, helped me a great deal. Only on one occasion, somebody had recognized me in a streetcar and started yelling aloud that there's a Jew and I should be caught and arrested. Obviously, I was able to, uh, get away. The Nazis started actions to... ...arrest and deport large portions of the Jewish population. They would come in sort of waves and so everybody for that particular period of time, knowing that they are... ...rounding people up, would try to hide and try to survive that particular period. My family... ...by giving the last pair of diamond earrings from my grandmother, made a deal with a driver for the Gestapo... ...where my whole family was hidden right behind a headquarters of a Gestapo. In Lwow there were garages. So, in one of those garages, on top, under the roof, they were... ...lifted there, even my own grandparents, into that hiding place for the-- to keep them there for a few days until the worst action was over. How they managed to stay quiet there, all I know is that I had to... ...sneak in through the... ...Gestapo motorpark... at night... ...to help empty their chamber pots and also bring them some food and water. Somewhat of a risky operation that was. Lwow was a- was a death trap. It was getting rapidly worse and worse, the degradation, the hunger, the striving for supply of food. There was still street executions, there were people being hung out of balconies, which I was a witness of. This is when I decided that I have to separate myself from my family, uh, then the age of 16, and I had to escape or I was going to die. My-my-my sense of survival and feelings of survival were so strong, I just didn't want to die. I saw my grandparents, my mother's parents, being loaded onto the truck, two old people who quarreled all their life because he was unfaithful and she was jealous and suddenly those two old people supporting each other were taken onto the-- helped onto the truck and shipped off. [somber music ♪] The last time I saw my mother was in the summer of 1942. At that time... ...uh, to help support us... ...she, the beautiful lady, the concert pianist... ...was selling... ...cakes from a tray. I remember... ...stopping by, running through, busy as I was, to say hello to Mum, and she gave me a cake and kissed me, told me to be careful and that was the last time I saw her. Then, a day or so later... ...I ran into my father... ...who was... ...standing on a street, leaning against a fence... ...sort of like completely... ...worn out, and desperate, and was crying, and when I came, I said, "What's the matter?"

They just went to their death... ...and, uh... ...I think it with... ...great sadness... ...of what horror she must have gone through, this beautiful young woman, naked, no hair, being pushed into a crowded gas chamber.

To this day, I don't have an answer, I really don't know. I can't understand it. I found myself at the Lwow railroad station. The train for Warsaw was leaving in the morning. As my capital, I took with me, I think five or six sets of forged birth certificates, which I was hoping to sell in Warsaw because there was a demand for it and these were very good birth certificates I obtained with the help of a Parish priest, so I had them with me, lying there in the corner, waiting for the train in the morning, and I thought, "Well I'll be in Warsaw, sell that thing and I'll be safe and maybe be able to help my parents." A light shone in my eyes and it was a... ...Ukrainian militia and a German SS man, Bahnhofschutz, demanding documents. So I produced mine which were already under a false name, and the Ukrainian laughed and looked at me, says, "I know you. You maybe not remember me, but I used to be a painter. I used to paint your grandparents' house." So, the son of a bitch who probably had a good job and got well paid, he was now going to turn me in, which he did. Janowska Street, which became infamous, was like a concentration camp. The selections were taking place there. Some... fit for work... ...stronger young men or women were kept there, others were sent off to, uh, death camps, primarily to Belzec. It was a big assembly field full of people sitting, waiting and so on. There were guard towers. Policemen were coming with baskets, asking everybody to deposit their money, valuables, what have you and so on. [muffled morose music ♪] There was a orchestra playing... ...and one of the camp commanders, Scharführer Rokita I think he was called, he said even himself, he was a musician, uh, he played in a band at one time, always liked to work with the Jews because they were very musical, and even, I remember, he made a few... ...dance steps in the mud, you know, tango steps to show how... ...you know, he was good on his feet. ♪ They were hanging some people for whatever crimes they might have committed in that camp, they were being hanged. The rope was short... ...and, uh... ...so one of these men was hanging, but choking, he was not really-- it was not enough of a drop to break his neck. Rokita ordered a kid to... ...assist with the hangings which the guy couldn't do. Uh, he broke down, he was crying, so... ...Rokita took his Luger and shot him. He ordered me to throw myself at his feet and give it a good pull to help him die. It was not an offer I could refuse very well, so... ...I was hanging on this guy's feet, helping him die. These bodies were cut off and they were being taken in wheelbarrows to an area like sandpits. The barrels were tipped and the bodies were rolled and pushed down into that pit and eventually some lime or something was thrown over them. So at this point... ...the Ukrainian guards... ...wanted me to go down there also and I realized once I go down, they're going to shoot me and execute me, so one less witness. At this point, I started screaming at him in German, saying that I was... ...Scharführer Rokita's personal assistant and interpreter and they'll be really punished if any harm comes to me and sure enough they didn't shoot me, and so I marched myself back. Then at night when it got dark, open staff cars came in with some... ...Gestapo and SS officers and they started a selection. So people were going line up and if you're old, you're here, you're young, you're here, there's going to be death or life. I was trying always to stay out of that circle just... ...trying to find out what really was going on before I commit myself to either... ...one or the other, and true enough... ...they always, they formed a third group... ...because as it often, in such mass actions, some people were... ...arrested on the streets, who had valid documents, maybe they worked for the German army, uh, maybe they shouldn't have been arrested, whatever they had good reason to be released and a small column was being formed... ...for them to march out of the camp, but they had to sleep outside of barbed wire in a ditch there because there was a police hour so they couldn't actually go back to the city. Somehow, I managed to get myself into that group, uh, Rokita recognized me, even said to his other German officers, you know... ..."Er ist ein finer junge" he's a good boy, he really helped me." and I joined that group and I marched out of the gate. Next to me was a girl and she held my hand and she obviously was quite nervous and yet gave me courage. Once we got ourselves out the gate, in the dark, in a ditch, having to spend the night together, we made love there, quietly in a ditch outside of Janowska Street. It was sort of like a celebration of life. [ambient music ♪] [pleasant song playing quietly ♪] [Gutowski] I made it to Warsaw, which was... ...to us, escaping from Lwow, it seemed like a promised land. There were beautiful red tomatoes being sold everywhere, so that for a long time until they real-realized some money with whatever I had, I was living on tomatoes. They were very tasty though. I contacted my aunt, Stasia, because of her pre-war connections to some high ranking Polish officers. One of those friends was then commander of the Polish underground army, General Grot-Rowecki. She was his personal liaison. She didn't particularly want to have any... ...close contact with me, but she did help me to get a place to live. I was completely on my own... ...which was, when you're looking back at it was a terrifying thing to be on your own when you're sixteen years old, pretending that you're older, and, yet know, you have to totally depend on yourself because what could my poor parents do for me while they were still alive?

I understand, I've been told... ...that... ...he tried to... ...with a group of other ex-officers, friends of his, Polish officers, uh, they tried to escape to Hungary, through the mountains and so on, but somebody betrayed them and so he was arrested in-in Lwow and executed. My brother, Roman, was then 12 years old... ...stayed in the custody of my uncle, Bronislaw. Roman wrote to me... ...pleading, pleading letter... ...would I come and save him? You know, my dear brother, you know, could I save him. Of course, I couldn't. So... ...some months after that when the now Ghetto was being formed in Lwow, with the wires or walls around it, and... ...their position became untenable... ...uh... ...my uncle, Bronislaw... ...uh gave my brother poison. Being a doctor he had it, cyanide, so... ...he killed him, he killed himself... ...in-in 1943. I wasn't streetwise at all. I became streetwise. Suddenly, you had, uh, 360 degree vision. You knew exactly who may be looking for you just a little too long, whose taking interest in you, how to deal with that, how to walk away. It's amazing how quickly one can get used to living in fear. It becomes a way of life, really. So it's a question of living in fear or-or-or trying to be fearless. I'm not quite sure what it gave me the. I cannot think of a better word than chutzpah to behave the way I did. Maybe the very fact that I... ...had few times encounters with the Germans that I was... ...let off free, nobody arrested me, made me more and more self-assured, and- and risk-taking. People were dying left and right and being taken to camps, imprisoned, executed. I had a strange sense of immortality. [big band song playing ♪] I managed to get myself a job working for the Junkers German Aircraft manufacturers at the Warsaw airport in Okcie. They had a big repair base for the Ju 88s, 87s, which would come in shot up from the Russian front, were repaired and sent back. Speaking German, I used to crawl... ...through the plane, the bomb compartments, the cockpit and everything, check that all the wiring, there was proper, there was no damage, destroyed and so on, and make a report. And it didn't take very long. When dealing with equipment, a scheme has occurred to me, which could be formed both patriotic and profitable. I made a point of becoming friendly... ...with the German Luftwaffe soldier also working in that radio storage, he was a radio specialist, and it didn't take me very long in a private conversation to establish that he was very, very, anti-Nazi, in fact hated Hitler, they hated the whole thing, and was ready... ...to work with me, possibility removing some... ...of that equipment from the airport, knowing that it would go to the Polish underground. I made contact to... ...the Polish Underground and they said, well, they would want to see one set on a trial basis. Karl Christian, being a technician, drew up a connecting scheme because it wasn't simple. At that time it wasn't just one unit. Obviously, I couldn't take it out of the airport, there were guards at the gate, which he, in a uniform, could do. A Luftwaffe with a rucksack, nobody even bothered to stop him. He would walk over to the house where I lived, he would come up and give me the piece of equipment, which then I put under the bed, and he would stay, I would feed him, vodka, sausage, and send him back on his way. There was a Christmas I had a lot of vodka, we both got drunk. At one point Karl Christian let out a big fart, and he stood up... ...raised his arm, and yelled "Heil Hitler!" Well, that started us off, and through the rest of the evening, we were drinking, farting and yelling, "Heil Hitler!" One day, in the morning, I got a call that the Gestapo with dogs came looking for me, obviously because of the radio stations, and I was quite correct, the business got a little too big. I figured it would take them about ten minutes for the SS or for the Gestapo to... ...get over to where I was living because I was sure they were given the address. I left everything behind and I ran over to my... ...girlfriend's house to speak to her mother, Dr. Zenona Rewerska, and tell them my predicament, and she said that she would hide me, that she would keep me. Being a non-Aryan out on the street, without an armband, that in itself was immediate deportation or execution. Not only were you at risk, but anybody who helped you. Anybody who helped a Jewish person, even with food, drink or shelter, there was a death penalty for that. Dr. Zenona Rewerska became my surrogate mother. Loved me like a mother. She, at the risk of her life, let me stay in her apartment in this building. Uh, there was the entrance right here. I remember that on a few occasion, this man who was looking for me because- what was his name? You remember his name? - Kozowski - Ah, you see... - Targowa fifteen. - Hmm? Targowa 15 street, Targowa street. Yeah, yeah, you have a perfect memory. Mr. Kozowski, who-- he was the-- my landlord in Targowa 15 and so when the Gestapo couldn't find me, they told him that he has to help find me otherwise they're going to take him. [chuckling] So... ...on various occasions he tried to break into your apartment. [speaking Polish] [Gutowski] Yes, what happened was that he was, you know, really persistent. He tried to even just sign in as your mother's patient to be able to uh, come into the apartment to see if I was there. [speaking Polish] [Gutowski] Those basements were connected with each other where you could enter the basement in one part of the building, you could exit all together in a different part of the building. You can exit in a different street. [Rewerski] For you and for us it is very comfortable in this time. Yes it was. So, you were also helping to save my life, no? Yes, it is true. - Absolutely. - It is true. When the time came, you know, for me to-- really I had to leave, I couldn't uh, you know, risk... ...your and your family's- your mother's life. She... ...she got me a set of new documents. Yes, I remember. [speaking Polish] As far as the family's concerned, he says "What is this Gene? I mean, he's always been Witek to us, and he's Witek, and he remains Witek, which is from Witold, which is obviously my name, Witold Bardach. We've been good friends ever since. [Gutowski] I started me a new life as Eugeniusz Gutowski, courtesy of the Polish underground. A common way for people to, uh, change identities and... ...get out of the city would be to join a labor organization, German labor organization working for the... ...uh, German armies everywhere was Organization Todt. Riga became available. There was a company, Polish company called Metzger, and I signed with them in my new capacity as a bookkeeper. I mean I've never kept books, I know nothing about the accounting. The train was... ...blown up by the partisans... ...before it got to Riga, but apparently it was sort of a daily occurrence, nobody was particularly hurt, they had to put a locomotive back on the track and we continued to go to Latvia. [ambient music ♪] In charge were two Polish gentlemen... ...who greeted me warmly and said... ..."I'm so happy you came here because we must go to Warsaw to consult with the main office, but we'll be gone only two, three days, we'll be back. Would you please, in the meantime... ...look after everything for us?" I said, "Sure." Except that they've gone and they never came back. The German supervisors came and said, "Where are they?" "I don't know. They've gone to..." "And you?" "I'm the bookkeeper." "Okay, you're the boss now." So, suddenly I find myself as a head of a construction company of about a hundred guys who were totally unwilling to work. I became somewhat of a local... ...celebrity... because with Christmas coming, we had a big Christmas tree but absolutely no means of decorating, and I had an idea and they have got boxes of, uh, German army condoms... ...which were issued to the soldiers. I blew them up to make balloons out of them and painted figures of saints, Santa Claus, you know, these things on the... ...blown up condoms, and strung up and made a condom tree-- Christmas tree. It was a big success. Ah, the German officers, you know, used to come from all over Riga to look at it, congratulate me, and so, you know, I was getting... ...extra rations of booze, cigarettes, and so on. [Film Narrator] After advancing as far as Riga, the Russians were temporarily forced back a short distance during the second week of August. It is this short-lived success, which the Germans are here exploiting. Tanks and motorized units cut through the Russian barrage in front of Riga and a large number of Stukas re-establish land communications with combat divisions in Latvia. [Gutowski] This was Germany on the verge of defeat. These were very dangerous days because... ...they were on site executing deserters, executing people left and right, so one really had to be careful not to be, uh, shot. With the advances of Soviet army, uh, the Germans were running away from Latvia and they were... ...loading up on ships to make the perilous crossing of the Baltic to the German harbor. I have decided I didn't wish to be liberated by the Russians again. I've had the pleasure once before, and I said, "Thank you, I'll pass." I managed to persuade the transport officers that... ...me and my company were essential to the German victory and that we have to be loaded on the ship to continue our... ...essential work for the further glory of the Nazis. Some bribes got me onto one of the ships, and the convoys were then crossing the Baltic, losing most of the convoy to the Russian submarines. I remember staying on a deck of the ship, wrapped in a life jacket I stole off a sleeping German soldier. Rather he drowns than me. Quite spectacular in the night to see them exploding and going down. Put us in trains and moved us all the way from the Baltic being strafed by American and British planes, right across Germany into Austria. I didn't like that journey because you know, so, what a silly way... ...to get killed at the end of a war by your own planes. And thus... ...I found myself... ...in a little town in Austria aptly called Judenburg. I had to work in the woods, cutting trees and carrying the logs onto the trucks. Then suddenly, it was all over. The guards ran away. The Soviets were approaching, so I took all my earthly possessions, uh, which were very, very few, but one of them was my, uh, lovely... ...Gary Cooper double-breasted suit, which I was carrying with me just for the occasion of liberation so I can dress up very nicely and join the free world again looking like something. It was an extraordinary journey because... ...there were masses of humanity... ...on the road, day and night, running away from the Russians. I can't even tell you the mixture. There were former enemies, there was the SS, there was escaped prisoner of war, there were concentration camp inmates, there were Jews, Poles, uh, Italians, Romanian Air Force, I mean, the whole mixture of people who became subjugated by the Germans or the Nazis or collaborated with them, now escaping jointly, saying, "Okay, we'll settle our differences later. Now, let's get out of harm's way now." Nearing the River Enns... ...I put my rucksack on the little... ...horse-drawn wagon of some Hungarians who had it, and I went forward on foot. People from the back started yelling that the Russian tanks were coming and true enough looking back, I could see, from a distance, the dust clouds of the Russian tanks were making on the road. I said, "Well, I'm just now going to wait for them." I could see, crossing the bridge, that they were American tanks and American military vehicles on the other side. I ran across the bridge, just about collapsed at the feet of a-- of an American soldier. He helped me, and I said in perfect English, you know, "Thank you very much," you know, sort of, "thank you." He was absolutely amazed that he found such a nice boy who spoke English and, uh, went in to his vehicle, got me a first taste of whiskey, and that was that. German army units, with their officers, with their vehicles, that came across, ready to go into prisoner of war camps, this being the first moment, so the American officers, and MPs, and Jeeps were herding them like shepherds. In fact was a total chaos. This obviously was a front unit, there was a colonel and other American officers and there were German officers who were reporting to them and asking for instructions. They starting translating. They were high ranking German officers, I think, there was even a General asking me to please tell the American officer this and this, and this one would tell him that, and I said, "Well, that's the place to be." I looked at myself and I looked absolutely awful. I looked around, nowhere could I find my Hungarian cart with my suit, in this dirty old Organization Todt uniform, which looked suspiciously like an army uniform and I figured out, the quicker I get out of it the better because somebody's going to stick me into the wrong, you know, compartment here and I'll find myself in a German camp. I went into town, looking how I could get myself something to wear. Walking the street I saw Men's Tailor, Herrenschneiderei. Knock, knock. Finally somebody opened, they said, "Look, there's nothing, absolutely nothing. There's no clothes, no suits, zero", and tried to close it in front of my face at which point I produced my P38. He opened it, realized I was not going to shoot him and in perfect German, I said, "Look, I just need a suit." "I don't have any more. Well let's see what I have." Took me down to his, uh, workplace and indeed there were a lot of... ...mostly uniforms, which were not collected, never will be, you know of various Nazi officials and a few private suits sort of finished were hanging there. I found one, which... ...just about fitted me, I was pretty skinny in those days. Maybe it was not my Gary Cooper suit, but I certainly looked different that what I did when I arrived. I, uh, went back looking for my... ...American officers and they suggested that I should go further north where there were headquarters of the Counter Intelligence Corps, uh, for the 20th Corps, who they were sure could use my services as an interpreter. That'll be 35 Russian, 12 Belgians, three French, and three Yugoslavs. How many of those are women? 28 Russian women... ...and 11 Belgian boys with a priest. Yes sir, we'll be ready for them. There were very few linguists really in the CIC, unfortunately. I was very welcome. So, at the end of the day, I was safely, in a clean bed as part of an American unit. So, it was... ...a very long day, but in a way a very happy day, so that was the end of the war for me. [quiet dramatic music ♪] The first few days after the war was extraordinary. The bridges on the autobahn were blown up. The remnants of war material was still on the road, there were shot up tanks and a lot of German planes were using the autobahns as landing and starting places were pushed and parked still on both sides of the... ...of the autobahns. Having lost my entire family, I enjoyed seeing a defeated Germany... ...and they were truly defeated. There was chaos, there was no food, there was millions of... ...refugees milling about, not only Germans, but also the other nationalities of which... ...the Germans had brought into Germany as forced labor. There were inmates of concentration camps, every nationality had to be dealt with. Allied forces determined that anybody who has held certain rank, above a certain level, in any party or... ...military or paramilitary, or SS, Gestapo organization was to be automatically arrested, thrown into an internment camp, later to be dealt with. We had more than our hands full, uh, just simply arresting people. Very shortly, I was officially pronounced as an acting agent... ...in the Counter-Intelligence Corps. I was given the privilege of wearing an officer's uniform with the insignia and save for the fact that I was not an American citizen, had the same duties and responsibilities and the privileges of other American agents. Our powers were absolutely unlimited at the time. I would go to the office and pick up my days work, and by myself with a big .45 pistol, which was very, uh, persuasive because it was very large, and a pair of handcuffs. I would take off and, uh, arrest people, give them, very politely, give them three minutes to pack up their things, say goodbye to their families, which was more than they used to give me in my day, then back them into a Jeep and bring them to the prison in Starnberg. At one time I actually lost my temper. Otherwise, I tried to be very level-headed, behave uh, properly... ...wouldn't touch anybody, wouldn't push, wouldn't shove, wouldn't, uh, beat anybody up, except for a couple of suspected Werwolves, which were young Nazis, they were trained to eventually sabotage the Americans. I remember then when we captured a few, we gave them a good beating... ...but they deserved it. On this particular occasion, a- a German general walked in with all his decorations and medals. I was sitting alone and he wanted to know if there was an officer around because he wanted to give himself up. I very politely said, "Well, I'll take you in, you know... ...it's my pleasure." Uh, no, no, no. He-he-he could only turn himself to somebody of- of an officers rank, and who was I? I mean obviously, he was looking at me with such contempt... ...and then something snapped in me... ...and I tore his epaulettes off and I tore his medals off, so much for giving himself up to a... ...uh, to somebody of an equal or an officer's rank because he, as a general he couldn't be arrested by plain Polish or even Polish-Jewish refugee. [speaking Polish] I was doing my job well, but I also learned of privilege. First living in this baronial castle on the lakeshore of Starnberg with a beautiful estate with it's own boathouse and which we had a motorboat and a sailboat. There was six of us drawing rations and food for about 145 people with plenty of drinks with plenty of servants and so on. I quickly learned that I could commandeer any car I wanted because they were requisitioned from the Germans and standing in the garages where anybody, particularly from CIC, can come and pick anything they want. Well, was I ever picking. Our excuse was that we needed those cars for undercover work. I mean, give me a break, I had a big supercharged Horch, a Mercedes, even a Maybach for undercover work. I quickly became... ...the entertainment director for the unit. Using my connections we were giving weekend parties. We became very famous for the party-giving. I was in charge of the talent. Jugglers, dancers, all kinds of little nightclub acts, so we could give those wonderful parties on Saturday night, and this is how I met my future wife, Zillah, who was an American, and she came to Europe with the Allied Control Council. Somebody brought her as a date to her party. So we met, romanced, fell in love, and eventually travelled all over Germany, together on weekends, in any one of my cars. Zillah and I decided to get married. At this point, I was in full denial so I was thinking there's going to be a big church wedding in St. Lucas Cathedral, and I was paying everybody with cartons of cigarettes because that was the established currency. It took I don't know how many cartons of cigarettes to get the singers from the Munich opera. It was a good wedding, and a big party after. [quiet dramatic music ♪] The national visas are granted based on the country of birth. Most surviving concentration camp inmates and the survivors, most of them were born in Poland. All the Jewish immigrants going to America were going on a Polish what's called a quota. They passed a new law in the State Department... ...and they decided to divide the Polish quota 50/50 to give the non-Jews a break. Okay? So when I learned about it, obviously Zillah told me about it, and I was then qualified as a bonafide non-Jew... ...I jumped at the opportunity. Uh, it was a priest, who, writing on his knee, issued me with an affidavit of support on the basis of which I got my visa. To add to my complicated life story, I entered America... ...on a corporate visa, on an affidavit visa, by the Catholic Refugee Organization. [accordion music ♪] We left in 1947. First went to Paris for a few days with Zillah, had a wonderful time with her, went clubbing, went to restaurants, bought her a beautiful hat with flowers, she always wanted to have a French hat... ...and went on the SS America to the United States. [waves splashing] It was as a rough passage, in fact, and uh, oh my God, there were a group of nuns sitting on the deck, refusing to go down and only continuously getting sick all over the place, so... ...as I say I always have this vision of vomiting nuns. There was a very handsome... ...Irish... ...dark-haired Irishman, who just went to Europe to visit a family after the war in Ireland. He got off the boat before I did, so by the time I came down the plank, he was already standing at the pier with open arms, yelling, "Welcome to America! Welcome to America!" Passing the Statue of Liberty that day obviously I was very excited. It was a new land, a new experience, a new chapter in my life... ...and it was just lovely. It was wonderful. I didn't know what to expect, I was hoping for the best, that the best, only the best will happen for me now. [traditional Polish song ♪]
