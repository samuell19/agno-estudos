[gentle music] [Rosalba] Love is a wonderful thing. You meet, you fall in love and you get married. In that order. But love, like life, is never perfectly arranged. [birds chirping] [car revving] [accordion playing] Sorry, Jeff, we have to go visiting. - [Jeff] Always? - Come on, Robert. My dad says we have to show respect. - [Joe] Good to go? - [Robert] Yep. [car humming] [gentle classical music] Go and sit with the men. Oh, I can't play cards. [baby crying] Mama. [Rosalba] There was a time when arranged marriages were not uncommon in our community. [Rosalba] Someone knew someone who was suitable to someone. Them two? What do you think, compare? [Rosalba] It was the way it was. We even had a word for it, combinare. [Rosalba] To arrange. [Rosalba] But the world was changing and so were we. Some of us sooner than others. [gentle Italian music] Is Compare Joe the Godfather? [Dino] Well, yes, he is your godfather. You know what I mean. I've read the book. Look, Angela, Compare Joe's family, like your dad's, have been here a long time. Helped lots of people in business. Look at me. Grazie, I'll take those. Think big, Joe. Falla. You know what they say about you? Yes, I do. [upbeat music] [Angela] He said, "The only thing more nauseating than my romantic clichés was my two dimensional heroine." [chuckles] He hated it. I'm sure he didn't hate it. He hated it. [sighs] Oh, yeah. I finished it this morning. I feel both empowered and helpless now. - Try being Italian. - [Emma chuckles] Tom! - What are you doing here? - [Tom] Hey, babe. I'm taking you to lunch. Hey, Emma. So, just got these printed. One for you, a couple for you. Tom Bell Entertainment. It's very professional. It is professional, isn't it? [laughs] If my Nonno saw me eating with these chopsticks, she'd have kittens. [Tom] Ah, bravo. Thank you. [people chattering] Got you something. - What's that? - It's not a ring, don't worry. Tom, it's beautiful. - But... - You don't like it? No, I love it. It's too expensive, you can't afford it. Shh, it's too late. I already got it engraved anyways. Came in to a bit of money recently, and I wanted to get you something. Wow, that's very nice. Thanks. You like it? Do you have to go? I'm working in the shop this afternoon. I can take you. Or I can just drop you off on the corner, it's fine. I want you to meet them, Tom, it's just... It's just what? Complicated at the moment. [bell dinging] Robert's going to love these. - You must be counting the hours now. - Mhm. [dinging] - Angela. - Hi, comare. Hi, everyone. Hi, Francesca. - Hey, Angela. - Angela, Robert's coming home. Oh, that's good. Yeah, we're having a little welcome home party for him on Sunday. You have to come. I have a lot of studying. Of course she'll come. - Huh? - He'll be so happy to see you. She gets more beautiful every day. Mhm. [chuckles] [Emma] Promised? What does that even mean? It's like an arranged marriage sort of thing. I thought they only did that in India. My dad is so old-fashioned. Does Tom know about your fiancée? I've never really taken it seriously. I'm guessing that's a no. Tom doesn't know about Robert, and my parents don't know about Tom. I'm Italian. The boy you bring to the door is the boy you marry. What's he like? - Robert? - Yeah. I don't really know. He's five years older than me. Sort of witty but distant all at the same time. [Emma] You like him. [Angela] I had a serious schoolgirl crush on him. Angela. Darling, why don't you go and say goodbye to Robert before he goes? Mom. Go, darling, go. [gentle Italian music] Angela, hey. You look really nice. Thanks, Robert. You must be excited about Oxford. If by excited, you mean totally terrified, - then, then, yeah. - [both chuckle] I haven't even made my own bed before. I want to go to uni too one day. Then you should. Yeah, my dad wants me to work in the shop. Oh, I'm sure he won't stop you. Your dad, he got me a real cool pen set. - Really? - Yeah, for uni. It's, it's really nice. [Joe] Why don't you ask her to dance? She's just a kid, Dad. [upbeat music] He was never into me. And his sister tells me he has a girlfriend in England, so. Your life is so complicated. Tell me about it. [woman chuckles] [Robert] You've got visitors? [Joe] Just some family and friend, Rob. [Robert] And compare? Wait until you see Angela. Oh, Aunt Sia. I didn't see you before. Roberto, you're too skinny. Of course. Whatever you need. [Dino] What could this man possibly need? Ah, Falla! Welcome home, Robert. Thank you, thank you. Hey, excuse me! - Bruno! - Hi, Robert. You're a teenager, what's going on? Hey, is your sister here as well? She had to study. - But she'll be here. - Yeah, cool. I'll, I'll be right back, okay? Okay. [chuckles] Hey. Look at you. Huh? He's a man now, he's a man. - I don't know about that. - Are you back for good? [Joe] Yeah. You think Maria would let him leave again? Yeah, I think so. It's good to be home. [keys jingling] Three keys? [Joe] One is for the car. One is for the office. And the third one is... A surprise? Uh, thank you. [all cheering in Italian] [Robert] Some kind of surprise. [Jeff] What, someone's chastity belt? Roberto. I want that key. You remember Diana, don't you? Hi. Yeah, but I don't think I've seen you since... I think it was, um, at my confirmation. Yeah, that's it, I think. She's going to be your secretary. - My secretary? - Mhm. Oh, you don't have to give me the job. No, no, no, uh, that's okay, I just... She's already set up the office, Roberto. Done a great job too. Well, uh, thank you. Hi. [chuckles] Um, I'm Jeff, Robert's best mate. And successful sports journalist. Diana just moved in from the country. Her father and I go back a long way. I'd be happy to show you around if you want. Someone ball? - [Joe] Let's go back in. - [Robert] Lovely to see you again. [birds chirping] - [Jeff sighs] - Oh my. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just this welcome home barbecue. The one I'm not invited to? Yeah. This boy Robert, he... well... He's what? His father and my father have this stupid expectation that we're going to get married. - [Tom snickers] - It's not funny. But no one can convince you to marry anyone you don't want to. They just don't do that anymore. You don't know my father. And he feels indebted to Robert's dad. [bell dinging] [Angela] My dad was on a delivery. Papa! - Oh, my God, oh, my God. - She's having a baby! - [Joe] I'll get the car. - It's okay. - Just stay here. - [Maria] Okay. - [Rosalba groans] - Shh, shh. It's okay, breathe, breathe, breathe. It's okay, shh. [Angela] He was the one that drove my mom to the hospital, and I was born just in time. And Robert's dad isn't just my godfather. [scoffs] What does that mean? He's connected. [gravel rustling] You're out! - [laughs] - [Robert] Hey, grab that. [people chattering] Angela, hey. Hi. [Bruno] Hey, Angie, look what Robert brought me back, isn't it grass? Look, he's bought us all some beautiful gifts. Have a look. I've got a grandfather watch. It's called a fog watch. Francesca. [Joe] Well, looks like a grandfather watch to me. All we need now is some grandchildren. Right, Sal? [guests laugh] I actually got you a gift as well. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Why don't you two go out, get some fresh air? [Joe] Yeah. - [Angela chuckles] - Our families, huh? The subtlety of an atomic bomb. [chuckles] I know, this whole promise thing. It's just so silly and awkward. - It is definitely awkward. - Hm. You know, not so long ago, arranged marriages were common in our community, they even had a word for it. Look, we're both educated, Robert. Yes. [chuckles] Oh, um, English Literature at Melbourne Uni. That's, that's really great. Thank you. Done all right yourself? No, I never, uh, never doubted you'd get there. [birds chirping] My Nonno used to plant tomatoes in this very spot. It's where I started out. Now I grow my own, my own family. I'm seeing someone. - Really? - Mhm. Uh, right, uh, congratulations. My father doesn't know though, so. [both chuckle] [loudly sighs] - I should go see if they need any help in the kitchen. - Yeah. I mean, you know what they are like. I'll be in in a minute. Okay. And this is the bit I don't like. Ah, it's fine. Tell her, Angela. Gianna's moved in down the road. Yeah, Mom told me. I haven't seen you since... well, Oh, don't worry. [Francesca] Hey, Angie, don't forget your present. [Maria] An old book? No, it's... it's a first edition. I should thank him. [Diana] A list of all your appointments. Ah, right. Italian, Italian and Italian. Your father organized most of them. - Well, I guess I'll see you at work. - [Robert] Yeah. [Sal] It's good, child, it's good, what. - [Joe] You happy? - [Sal] No, I'm happy but... Dad? Can we go now? So early? I have to study, compare. Did you have a good chat to Robert? Yeah. We'll stay a little longer. Your father made it specially for Roberto. We cut the cake. [light somber music] [insects chirping] Come to bed. What's wrong with her? She's stressed with her studies, that's all. Well, she wanted to go to university. I think she's seeing someone. [Sal] A boyfriend? Who? I don't know, I just saw something. Well, he's wrong for her. - You don't know him. - What do I need to know him for? [scoffs] You were wrong for me once, remember? Do you honestly think my father was happy about me marrying a Sicilian? I made a promise to Compare Joe. - We owe him. - The world's totally changed, Sal. Joe and Maria would understand it. Robert's not like our daughter. He listens to his parents. Let's go to bed. [sighs] [birds chirping] Wait until you see inside. [Robert] Oh, wow. Looks amazing, Dad. It's better than new. I've always liked this house. Well? It's yours. It's mine? Thought you and Mom wanted me at home. Yes, but after the wedding. I don't think things are going to work out the way you think, Dad. Why not? What happened to my tomato patch? You don't have time for that. Marriage is once, Robert. Angela is the one for you. So, what's this one about then, huh? [Angela] It's about a girl. Who falls in love? Ow! [laughs] What are you going to do when I actually have my novel published and it becomes an instant classic? I'm going to live off your royalties, obviously. You're going to have to read it. No, I can just go see the film because it's going to be that good. My parents know about us. Did you tell them? Not exactly. But they know, and we need to do something before they do. [light upbeat music] - Angela, hi. - Hi. Do you have a minute? Ah, do you have an appointment? I'm kidding. Of course, come on in. Sorry, take a seat. Thank you. Welcome to the office of Prima Partners. Need help getting out of a parking ticket recently? [chuckles] No. I want you to do something for me, for us. Yeah, of course, anything. I was hoping you'd talk to your father and my father actually. Get this whole silly promise thing out of their heads. This whole promise thing. I don't suppose your boyfriend likes the idea of you being betrothed to another man, huh? Actually, he's been surprisingly... fine about the whole thing. He just started his own business. Ah, cool. On his own. Well, he sounds like a decent man. [Angela] He is. Look, I'd talk to them myself, but... well, you know our fathers. Yeah. Besides, I hear you're a great lawyer. You should be good at getting out of those contracts. You do want to get out of this, don't you? You remember my Nonno's old place? The one, uh, not far from here? Yeah. My dad gave it to us. What? Yeah, you could say it's renovated. It's real modern and classy. - It looks really nice. - I'm sorry, did you just say us? Did you say he gave us a house? For after we're married. [chuckles] People don't usually get married because they are given a house, Robert. People usually get married because they are in love. Look, Angela. Coffee, anyone? That's okay. I should go. [Robert] Okay. So, you'll talk to them? Yeah, of course. [light upbeat music] [scraping] Jeez, are you even chewing it? - Mhm. - Leave him alone. He hasn't eaten probably in five years. [chuckles] You know, a couple things I miss most, I reckon your lasagna was right up there - apart from you. - Mhm. I fell in love with your mother because of that lasagna. Did you see the house? If he doesn't like it, I'll take it. You think Angela will like it? Talk about Angela. What about her? What if she doesn't want to marry me? [Joe scoffs] She'd be crazy to say no to you. Did you talk to her? But last time I checked, marriage was between two consenting adults, Mom. Sal and Dad are adults, they consented, that's two. What's the problem? I just don't think I need to rush things with Angela, that's all I'm saying. What rush? They made the promise 20 years ago. Yeah, she's got you there, Rob. And she's not even a lawyer. And just, I don't even know her anymore. We need time to get to know each other again. Why are you talking like this? We've known her and her family all her life. What do you need to know? She has a boyfriend. Who? What's it matter? That horse is the closest thing they have to a saint in this country. Thanks for coming. Take a seat, Tom. We've never met, but I believe you know my goddaughter, Angela. Yes, I do. Do you know who I am? I've heard, yeah. And I can assure you that my intentions for Angela are completely honorable. And I'm going to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Marriage is a big commitment. Are you sure you're in a position to get married? We'll make it work, yeah. I like your confidence. You ever bet on the races, Tom? I have a feeling you're going to give me a tip. Think big in business, think small when gambling. But you don't think small, do you, Tom? You want to get rich quick. Well, I want to get ahead. I've started my own business actually. Um. Tom Bell Entertainment. Yes, I know. I also know you are... over ten grand in the red... with bookies. It's not nearly that much. It was just a bit of bad luck, that's all. But I'm getting ahead now. What are you doing? Settle your debts... and get out of town for a while. Take a holiday for a couple of months. I hear the Greek islands are a good place for a young man to clear his head. I can't be bought. Then tear it up. I love her. Then tear it up. What would happen if I did tear it up? In my world, debt needs to be repaid one way or the other. [Angela] He's Italian, Tom. Oh, we know, we know. How? [sighs] Your father's really worried about you, you know? He doesn't need to be. Do you love him? Yes. Oh, this is going to break your father's heart. We just want the best for you. That's all. [pouring] Dino. Joe. I want you to organize a wedding for Robert and Angela. Did Robert propose? Four weeks, my anniversary. But we're booked. I'll take care of that. You take care of everything else. But, Joe... The best of everything. [upbeat music playing on radio] ♪ I beg your pardon ♪ ♪ I never promised you a rose garden ♪ - Working? - [gasps] What did Compare Joe want? Well, he... had good news. There's been a cancellation at the ballroom, and we can have the wedding in four weeks. - What? - He said it's a great honor for both our families, what could I say? Was Robert there? [knocking on door] - [Angela sobs] - What's the matter? - Hey! - They told me I can't see you anymore. - Who? - My parents. [sobs] Hey. - It's okay. - I don't know what to do, Tom. It's okay, baby. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, let me help. [knocking] [typewriter clacking] What is it, Bruno? Why can't you just go along with it? Is it because it's not how it happens in those books? Don't you want me to be happy? Robert's cool. What kind of man lets his parents choose his wife? He knows what he wants, that's all. And what is that? A good Italian girl from a good family. A girl who can cook, take care of the kids, and you know, a girl who hasn't slept around. You told her that? She thinks you're being forced to marry her to keep your parents happy. What do you think? - [Bruno] Bullseye. - Nice one, mate. [typewriter clacking] [knocking] Hey. Come in. This room hasn't changed much. What are you working on? Nothing. A short story for uni. Cool. Can I read it? Yeah. - This? - Mhm. No title. It's not finished. [typewriter clacking] [gentle music playing on radio] People will think she's pregnant, Sal. [scoffs] Let them think what they want. Yeah, but she's our daughter. She wants to marry for love. Like you and me did. Roberto, he loves her. Yeah, but she doesn't love him. Oh, she doesn't know what she wants. She's young, Sal. Talk to Compare Joe. And say what to him? That his son's not good enough for our daughter? She's my daughter too. [typewriter clacking] So, I like it, it's nice. Nice, that's it? I, I mean it's, uh, it's well written and everything. Just, I don't know, it doesn't sound like you. And what exactly do I sound like? I don't know, just not like that, I guess. You were supposed to talk to them. But you didn't have the guts to stand up to them, did you? Maybe we could be happy. I can't make you happy, Robert. Marriage isn't some business arrangement. I know, I know. Then why did you agree to it? Uncle Dino wants to see both of you at the ballroom. He needs to go over the wedding plans. Um, it's getting late, I should, I should probably go. [birds chirping] What would happen... if I ran away, eloped? It'd be shame, embarrassment, especially for your parents. But these things have happened before, and I guess life will go on. When could I come back home? Probably a few months. I'd let you know. Angela. You can rebel against your parents, you can rebel against the world, but love will find a way. - [Robert] Hey. - Robert. - [Robert] Sorry. - [Dino] Take a seat. [Robert] Hey, did I miss anything? No, well, we'll get started. - Okay. - I thought we'd start off with a traditional antipasto. And then a pasta. - Lasagna. - Ravioli. We'll alternate. I've been wanting to do that, excellent. Uh, right, mains. Honestly, Uncle Dino, whatever you think is best is totally fine with me. [Dino] Uh... So, when was the last time you two danced together? What about a practice? [light Italian music playing over radio] Uncle Dino just wants everything to be perfect, doesn't he? Hm. Don't you? Ah, more of a Sicilian thing, I think. I got so many memories of this place. Yeah. Like when you refused to dance with me because I was just a kid? Wow, you remember that? I do. - What about a Bombe Alaska? - [Robert and Angela] No. I was going away. Can you imagine what everyone would have said? And you really were just a kid, we both were. You still haven't answered my question. Why are you doing this? I can understand them wanting this, but you? Can you please just give me a chance? Marriage is built on love, not chance. She has a point, mate. [whacking] She's perfect for me. [groans] She doesn't love you. It's complicated. Rob. You're a cool guy, a good guy, but if you force this girl to marry you... - [scoffs] you're a real... - Asshole. Angela, this is the 70s, and to be clear, this is the 1970s, not the 1870s. Nobody can make you marry against your will. - Oh, my God. - My family's not like yours. Yeah, but you still have choices. Yeah, choices with consequences. There has to be something we can do to get out of this stupid promise. [light music] [knocking] We were supposed to meet, Tom. [gasps] Don't freak, it's not that bad. Not that bad? You have to get to a hospital! My godfather did this to you, didn't he? There's no way out, Ange. I'm sorry. [somber music] They really hurt him, Mom. It wasn't Compare Joe. He owed money to other people. They were gambling debts. Darling, they were trying to protect you. You believe anything they tell you! - Angela! - [Angela] They've won, Mom. What's going to happen to him now? That's up to him. Do you mean it's up to me? [gentle music] [priest] Robert and Angela, have you come here freely and without reservation to give yourself to each other in marriage? I, Angela, take you Robert, as my lawful husband. To have and to hold, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. Angela, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness. I pledge to you all that I am, and all I ever will be as your husband. I promise to love and respect and honor you. [pouring] [gentle music fading] [clinking] Champagne? No. Hey. We're husband and wife now. On paper. Angela. Angela. I'll never force you to do anything you don't want to do. [door shutting] [slamming] [upbeat rock music] [door thudding] We have a plane to catch. [groans] Around the city of love, huh? [groans] [Angela] Do you get drunk often? Only when I drink a lot. Oh, Angela, please, don't. Well, get ready then. [gentle music] I think I'm supposed to carry you over there. I've got that. Thanks. The counsel's just saying that you've got too many chickens. No, two or three? A dozen, a dozen. Free country! I'll write to them, okay? Oh. Thank you. Our best to your father, eh? Of course. [spoon clinking] - These are nice. - I made them last night. Why don't you bring them in? [Robert clears throat] How come your wife never goes? Uh, she's busy with studies, eh. You're not responsible for your nephew's debts, Mr. Bellucci. I want to help him. Well, if he doesn't pay within 14 days, they'll bankrupt him and after interest, he owes just under 20,000 dollars. You can buy a house with that money. He's had some bad luck. We could not have children. All we have is this one nephew. like my husband, See if he goes bankrupt, he has no future. We have some savings. If we could manage to settle his debts with that. His debt's unsecured. There's a very good chance that I can settle for half, anyway. Do your best. Um. One more thing. What business is Tommasino in? The music business. He's young, do you understand? Thank you. Uh, when he gets back, tell Tommasino - to come and see me, okay? - Okay. [light upbeat music] [typewriter clacking] [Robert] Ah, you're not in your room. Not working on a cookbook, are we? I can't cook. You want to help me? Sure. Yeah. [spoon clinking] That's quite enough garlic, that's good. I'm not going to be kissing you, aren't I? Or anyone else for that matter. Voila. Who taught you how to cook? I lived on my own for five years, so. "There's no virtue like necessity." Shakespeare. A good wife maketh lasagna. My old man. I like cooking. I was thinking one day I might open a restaurant or something. What about your practice? I like what I do but I, I don't know, this would be a... side business or something. Side business is a family trait then? Well, we've got good partners like your Uncle Dino. He's the only one that never gave me money as gifts. Only books. Yeah, me too. He's different. No woman, though. He's just waiting for the right one. Try this. - Good? - But good, yeah. Pass me that. What do you expect from me? What do you mean? None of this is real. It's all been arranged for us. It doesn't matter how we got together. Can't you see that? [doorbell dinging] Are you expecting someone? - [Tony] How are you? - [Robert] Good, come on in, hey. - I thought I'd surprise you. - Yeah. Ah, cool! [chuckles] [Angela] Tony! - Hey, Angela. - He had his first single. Oh, wow. Proud of you, man, that's awesome. [upbeat music] [Tony] Thank you, Angela, it was lovely. It's a collaboration. - That's a good word for it. - It's fresh eggs, Tony, the secret. [Robert chuckles] I'll go and get the coffee. [Robert] I'll give you a hand. [Angela] No, I've got it. Hey, do people ever talk about Angela and I? So, anyway, I've, uh, got a little bit of news for you. Mhm. So, yesterday I went down to the ballroom for a house show. And I got there early and I spied Dino and Gianna dancing together. Really? [Tony] They were on their own in the dark without music. There was no one around. She wasn't wearing black and, yeah, he wasn't wearing a bowtie. Cool. [chuckles] - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Angela will be thrilled. - Yeah, well, just keep hush about it because I don't believe it's public yet, so... [whistles] [chuckles] Yeah, anyway, how's the honeymoon? Yeah, no, it's, uh, it's good. Rome was great. I'm not talking about Italy. I was talking about the honeymoon. Uh. It was magical. You know, I've always wondered what's in one of these things. Oh, it's just the glory box. You have to wait for your wedding night to find out. Not very funny, Robert. Thank you, Angela. [birds chirping] [somber music] [horse neighing] Your secretary, Diana. Yeah, what about her? Mate, I'm smitten. [laughs] She is not a family you want to mess with. I can't get her out of my head. Whenever I talk to her the subject always comes back to you. Oh, she's just an impressionable girl from the country, what can I say? [birds chirping] [somber music] We're going to back the filly next. Nah, no chance against the colts? [sniffs] Yeah, but she's well-bred. I think she might improve over the distance. You all right, mate? Look, I always knew I wanted to be a lawyer, right? My dad told me, when you... you're going to be a lawyer before I even started school. That I would I have my own practice, that I would have a nice house, and that one day my wife would be Angela. Is that what you wanted? Always been what I wanted. She's not happy, Jeff. Mate, what did you expect? I didn't expect us to be sleeping in different bedrooms. [scoffs] Yeah, that's not supposed to happen in the first year of marriage. She's still reaching out to him, Tom. - How do you know? - I know. I already thought I'd win her over by now, seriously, I did. Have you told her how you feel about her? It's not that easy to talk to her. Then spell it out to her, how you feel about her. What if she doesn't come around? You're the lawyer. [scoffs] [hooves clopping] [scoffs] Did you even propose? [Angela] No, he didn't. I guess his father never told him to. There's more to him. [scoffs] Are you softening towards him? I can't fault him. But there's something else. I found out about Tom by accident. Tom? - How? - One minute he has money. Next minute nothing, he's completely broke, and I don't think he lost it in business. Gambling? My mom told me it wasn't my godfather who assaulted him, and I think she was telling the truth. [scoffs] I trusted him, Em! I only married Robert to protect him. Am I that naive? You were in love, and... love dumbs people down. You can quote me on that one. You know what my mother calls me? [Emma] What does that mean? Stubborn. [Emma] Funny that. Supposed to be easy. You meet, you fall in love, and you get married in that order. Maybe you should start dating. I've already made enough mistakes to last me a lifetime. - Not going to make another one. - [sighs] Not other people, your husband. See, when normal people meet, they go out on dates, and they get to know each other. I don't know, you did like him once. Tell you what. We can start tonight. But definitely not in that dress. - [Angela] I like it. - [Emma] It's disgusting. So, Robbie. Emma tells me that you studied at Oxford. Yeah, I did, I did. Well, how was it over there? It was good. I, I worked in a law firm in my final year on top of my studies which was pretty tough. Uh, but I loved it over there, alone, much to my mom's annoyance at me. [chuckles] She didn't want you to go? Oh, no, she, she did, I just didn't think she thought I'd survive. Um, but it was too good of an opportunity to miss. Pretty posh over there too, I imagine. Personally, I prefer to keep, uh, one foot on the ground. Then again I do pride myself on being progressive. [chuckles] Still, it is good to go out on one's own, is it not? How about you, Angela? Did you ever plan to get out on your own? Ah, it's a little hard for an Italian girl. Why? If we leave before we're married it upsets everyone. It's hard to explain. So, you leave the safety of one man's arms to go into the safety of another's? [laughs] No offense, Robbie. None taken. Don't you regret not experiencing life more before you... settled? I don't think my life is over. [BB] How'd the two of you meet, by the way? Uh, well, we've known each other since we were kids. Childhood sweethearts. [laughs] How charming. Not exactly. Uh, We were, an arranged marriage. [laughs] You're not joking? [Robert and Angela] No. Arranged by who? Our fathers. And you both just accepted that? Oh, well, if you ask me, my father's a got perfect taste. [Robert chuckles] You know, change for the sake of change isn't necessarily progress, eh. [people chattering] Cheers. [glasses clinking] Cheers. [waves lapping] Hey, thanks for playing along. [chuckles] He deserved it. So patronizing. Where did Emma find such a testy dickhead? [chuckles] Uni. Let me guess, he's studying politics. I don't know what she sees in him. Love is mesmerizing. Mysterious and dumb. Hey, you want to get something real to eat? - Yeah. - Yeah? I do. How can you not like Gone with the Wind? It's a classic. It's, uh, it's a masterpiece. What is there to like about Scarlett? She's complex. I call that crazy, she's crazy. I suppose you prefer your women obliging and subordinate. Ooh, the rest exist for that. Ah, thank you. Your table's been taken care of. Johnny Fresco. So, we don't like the same books. Or films. Do we have anything in common? Pizza. Half the world likes pizza. At least you're in the right half. - Chili? - Mm-hm. [Robert] Yeah, that significantly increases the odds to my favor. [chuckles] Marginally. That look, it's like I'm a puzzle that needs to be solved. [chuckles] I just can't seem to like you back, that's all. You know, what we should do, we should... ask each other one question a day and commit to giving an honest answer. - Okay. - Okay. I'll go first. Okay. You're a good looking guy. Thank you. You're successful. Mm, don't know about that. It's only a one man practice. I've been paid with - too many chickens. - [chuckles] You're charming when you put your mind to it. I can see how girls, some girls might like you. Some girls, huh? - Not all girls? - Mm-mm. So, why me? Was it just to please your parents? Ah, well, that was part of the reason, sure, but on... only a small part. And the other part? Were you looking for a project? What is there not to like about you? [laughs] Is that the best you got? Well... [laughs] it's actually, well, it's a question that my father asked me. And? Well, truth be told, I'm still thinking about it. I think about you a lot, you know. - Really? - Uh-huh. You know there are probably six people that I write birthday cards to. Wow, flattering, I'm one of the six. No, no, you didn't let me finish. But your birthday is the only one that I never needed to make an effort to remember. And... you've got a nice smile. I could see how... some men might, might find you attractive. Reverse psychology. - [chuckles] Working? - No. I didn't realize how persistent you are. I didn't realize you were so stubborn. Mhm. Like an ox. Like a mule. What's your question? I don't know, okay. Let me think about it, any one, huh? Okay, um. - What do you think? - About what? About tonight, our first date? - Yeah? - Mm. What do you think about sex on the first date? You've had three questions. - Okay. - I thought it was one. - Fair enough. - [chuckles] [insects chirping] [gentle music] [earrings clinking] [typewriter clacking] Mom. Buy something for the house. Thank you. Look, look, look, look. I found these in your bedroom. They are from Robert. You've kept them all these years. Yeah. What happened with Tom, Mom? I know he isn't who he says he is. [somber music] Your father asked Compare Joe to check him out. He had gambling debts. So, your godfather gave him a check to cancel all those debts. But in exchange for leaving you alone. And honey, it was your father's money. He banked the check, didn't he? He did. And Uncle Pat was there to keep an eye on things. And Robert went along with it because Robert listens to his parents. Am I right? He does love you, you know, Angela. He's not a silly boy, darling. [gentle music] Um. If you're going to be professional writer, you can't work from the kitchen. It's beautiful, thank you. Chair. Uh, and here. You can put it on if you like. - Yeah? - Mhm. - [Robert sighs] - How's it look? It's beautiful. Happy birthday. Thank you. [Robert] Oh, I have a secret. [Angela] I like secrets. Oh, yeah, you, you have to promise not to tell anybody, eh. Uncle Dino... and Gianna. You knew? - Yeah, I did. - Seriously? Oh, come on, Robert. You don't see the way they look at each other? The stolen glances, the way their eyes light up when they are in the same room? No. God, I guess I've been away too long. I'm happy for them though. Specially after Rocco. It's, it's good. Does my father's reputation bother you? Does it bother you? He's my father. I get the pressure. I know it's not easy to say no to him. Look, I know you, you blame him, or both our fathers for pushing you into... I just don't want them running our lives. That's all. Look, there's something you should know, um. I think you're beautiful. I thought of my question. - Oh, yeah? - Mhm. Tell me about your girlfriend. The one in England. Who told you? Word got around. My sister tell you? - Yes. - [both chuckle] She met her when, uh, she came to visit. Um, I don't know, it wasn't a, it wasn't a big deal. It was a big deal to me... at the time. Okay, well, her name was Carol. And... and we liked each other a lot but, um, we didn't love each other. How do you know? I guess you just got to know what to look for. [laughs] You stole that from my short story. I did, I liked that one. It's not yours. Okay, uh. In law, when something new is established, we call that a precedent. And you are the only one that has ever set a precedent with my feelings. How was that? Stick to law. - Yeah? - Yeah. Dance with me. [light romantic music on record player] Tell me about Tom. Don't you already know him? I'm doing some work for his Uncle, but, never met Tom. I met him at uni. He swept you off your feet? Just as I had imagined. You're in love with him? I think I loved the idea of being in love. Love was easy enough to write about, I guess. [breathing heavily] There's something I need to tell you. Yeah, what? It didn't happen, hey, hey, it didn't happen like you think. It... [sighs] Our fathers left the decision... [sighs] to marry up to me and, and it should have been ours to make. You tell me this after you marry me? I'm not proud of myself. I... You must think I'm a fool. [sighs] Hey, look, I understand how, how this looks, but it really doesn't change how I feel about you. You were there, weren't you? At the meeting to discuss my future, what was best for me? Is that how it happened, Robert? Tom had his issues, we both know that but you, your actions are far worse. You took advantage, - and for what? - For you. Oh! Any interest I may have had of you has been completely erased by your deception. Listen to yourself. First, you rejected me because you thought I was forced to marry you by my father, and now you reject me because I wasn't. Your father must be so proud of you. If I'm guilty of anything, it's that I've taken every opportunity I've ever been given with open hands. - Unlike Tom. - So, that's what I am, hm? An opportunity? And how was this opportunity going to play out for you, Robert? In time I would meekly surrender to you? Your charm, your status, your gifts? And I would become an obliging wife that you take for granted like your mother? Is she my precedent? My father is fair game but do not disparage my mother. I've never taken anyone for granted. You took me all the way to the altar. You should look at it as a compliment! Well, what should I have done, meekly surrendered you to him as you so eloquently - put it? - It wasn't up to you. You still don't get it! He didn't deserve you, Angela, he kept secrets! - How can you be with some... - So did you! [somber music] You're impossible to take for granted. Okay, the only secret I've ever kept from you is not telling you that I love you. I have always loved you. Get out, Robert. Angela, please. [door thudding] [crickets chirping] [knocking] Can I come in for a sec? [Angela] What's this? It's an annulment. I know you still pine for him. I saw the letter. I tore it up. Why? Why haven't you signed this? I was hoping that in time you'd realize that I was the man for you. I was ready to give you a chance. A chance you didn't give me. Yeah, love is dumb, eh? You were dumb. You did give me your hand in marriage. [somber music] You know? It was your father. He was the one that told me not to tell you before we got married. As for my father, don't blame him. He, uh, he washed his hands of the arrangement. Anyway. [light music] [upbeat rock music] [knocking] Your ten o'clock is here. Thanks, Diana. Just send him in. Tomassino. [Tom] Just Tom's fine. I figured if I cut it down to Tom from Tomassino I'd save about four years of my life. Take a seat. I've been told you've got something for me to sign. Yeah. When'd you get back? Last week. Robert Prima, the lawyer, huh? You made quite an impression on my uncle. He was a good man. Is that right? He did save you from bankruptcy, mate. Yeah, well, he could have settled for less. I think you should show him some respect. My wife. You're a lucky man. [somber music] [upbeat music] [upbeat music fading] [somber music] [doorbell dinging] What are you doing here, Tom? I went away for a while. I had a couple of problems to sort through. You couldn't discuss them with me? You left me in the dark. You let me believe it was my godfather. You let me marry him. I came to the church. I, I was scared, Angela. What's changed? I've changed. I know about the gambling debts. The bookies... the check. I'm going to Sydney. I'm leaving tomorrow and here's the address. Are you really happy with him? [upbeat music] [door thudding] [revving] [somber music] [Rosalba] His secretary? Why would he go near his secretary when he's got you waiting at home for him? Robert wouldn't do that. He's not like that. I saw it, Bruno. And it wouldn't be the first time. What's that supposed to mean? - Right, I'm calling Maria. - No, Mom. Please, don't call, please. Wait until your father finds out, Ange. What's going on? [birds chirping] Hello? Your grandfather didn't like me. Didn't like Sicilians, not for his only daughter. I had to work real hard to win him over. I remember thinking to myself... how could someone be so wrong about me? How could someone be so blind? That I was going to prove him and everyone wrong. That sounds familiar. All that boy had to do was tear up that check and face his problems like a man and he would have been yours. A man who can't take care of his problems, he can't take care of his family. When you were born, there were complications. If Compare Joe wasn't there... I know, Dad. But what you don't know... [somber music] ...is I wasn't out... making deliveries when your mother went into labor like I told you. Like I told everyone. I was playing cards. I left your mother on her own to play cards. Oh, I never forgave myself. But from that moment on I swore I would protect my family. You can't protect me from life, Dad. I'm ashamed, Angela. And I'm sorry. I didn't even know why he married you. He didn't have to. He told me he loved you. [Maria] That was Rosalba on the phone. She's in tears. She said... Robert's been sleeping with his secretary. What? Roberto, what's going on? I haven't slept with anyone. Why would Angela lie? Because she's in love with that other guy, Tom. He's back. If she told her family that I cheated on her then maybe they'd understand and let her out of this thing with an annulment, I don't know. You want me to talk to Sal? No, I don't want... She was forced into this thing once, I won't force her again. It's what she wants, it's, this is what I want, Dad. [somber piano music] Rob, that night, Angela didn't give me the impression that she was unhappy. I don't know, something just doesn't sit right. [tense music] [clinking] Diana? Has someone been in here? [upbeat music] Put those up. This belongs to my wife. [Angela] Everyone deserves a second chance. [revving] Where is she? Listen, I don't know what you're playing at, - but she is my wife. - She's not here. It's over. [light music] Good luck. Thanks. Hi. I'm making lasagna. You hate me that much? Angela, I know you think that I, - I did, I wouldn't... - I know. Diana called me, I was at Mom's. We deserve a second chance. I want you to be my wife. It was always you. [light music] [Rosalba] You can rebel against your parents, and you can rebel against the world. But in the end, you can't fight destiny, and you can't change fate. [gentle music]
