Hey, kiddo. Hey, Dad. Are you coming home soon? Yeah, uh, in an hour or so. What's up? Where's Mom? I don't think she's feeling good. I know. Don't worry. I'm working on getting her better, okay? It's just... She's been talking to herself. Listen. I will be home with you very soon, and I am gonna get Mom better. I promise. Okay. - I'll see you soon, buddy. - See you soon. You want anyone on overtime? No. I got to, uh... I gotta... Just go ahead and close up. Okay. Very least, maybe you could get her to stop locking herself in the closet, okay? Right. So, we don't call it an intervention, we call it a... Paul? I saw something. This thing is really starting to take its toll on him. - Paul! - One second, please. What? There was something in the back room. What do you mean, "Something?" Uh, I don't know. It disappeared. Esther, I really gotta deal with this, so... Just go home, okay? Be careful on your way out, okay? Okay, so I'll be home in about, uh, an hour. Okay. Yeah. Bye. Esther? Okay. Oh, no, no, no. Come on! Hey. What are the chances we go again? - Um... Slim to none. - Hmm. About that. - No? - No. I'm gonna go take a shower. Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll join you. You'll smell like girly soap. Hey. - Marathon man. - I'm up. Don't think you're staying. Becca. - Just one night? - Nope. You're gonna kick me out in the middle of the night. You're gonna be okay. You're not a puppy. I thought I was your boyfriend. "Boyfriend?" Who said anything about "boyfriend"? Uh, you're a guy, the only guy that I've been seeing. It's been eight months. Really? Eight months? - Eight months. - Wow! That officially puts you in first place. How about I keep a pair of jeans here? Nope. Uh, a sock? I mean, just one sock, of course. What are you gonna do with just one sock? Is that a yes? No! Get out of here. I have work tomorrow. Not like having a sock here means you can't get rid of me. Socks are not anchors. Okay, I'm gonna see you tomorrow night at that gig. Can we just agree to that, please? Yeah, all right. Are you still there? I'll see you tomorrow. You know, one of these nights, you could let me... Love you, too. Hey, sexy. I like you. A lot. Is that all? No. There is one more thing. So close. Mom? Mom? I just don't know what to do about it. I'm so sorry... I really don't. Mom? Hey, Martin, what's up? You okay? Yeah, I will be, just gonna take a bit. Did we wake you? - What? - Hey. You gotta go back to bed, sweetie. The only ones that should be wandering the halls at this hour are grownups. Good night, Martin. She isn't answering. Hey, Martin? Is there someone else we can call for you? It's just... I didn't know you had a brother. Yeah. Are you Rebecca? Uh, yeah. I'm Emma. I'm with Child Services. I was assigned to Martin after your father died last... Stepfather. - Excuse me? - He was my stepfather. My dad ran off when I was 10, and did not come back. If we could just talk about Martin for a minute? How is he when he's at home? Is he sleeping? I wouldn't know. I don't live there. So, it's just your mother in the house, then? Yeah. How is she holding up? Um, well, she's taking her antidepressants, if that's what you're asking. Okay, and how bad is it? This depression? I'm sorry, is Martin okay? 'Cause you're grilling me like he has a black eye or something. He fell asleep in home room this morning. For the third time in the past week. Okay, excuse me. Hey. You showed up. Yeah. I didn't know if you would. Okay. Uh, where's Mom? Martin, I know you and your mother are going through a lot. And it's harder for you because you can't talk to Mom about it. Maybe you even tried to help her? If you ever wanna talk about it, I'm here, okay? This is why you left. Isn't it? Uh, no, my deal was a lot more complicated. Okay. Let's go. I'll get you home. Your home? Or Mom's? Where you live. Hey. You're gonna be okay. Come on. He'll be fine. Okay. - We'll be in touch. - Uh-huh. Here we are. You should let me stay at your place. Just for a night. Good luck with that one, buddy. Um, you know what? I do not think you're really gonna like it there. 'Cause I have these weird, kind of, scary posters on the wall. I just need sleep. We can talk about it. Yeah? Any tips for the moms? Uh, you are not coming in. Come on, why not? Because she's crazy. Mom goes through phases like this. Just give her time. Has she been social with anyone? Someone keeps on coming over. Good. Who? Diana. What did you say? Her name is Diana. Hey, I know what you're going through, because Mom did the same thing to me when my dad left. And I had really bad dreams about Diana. But that's all that they are, okay? Because she isn't real. Becca, hi. Hi, Mom. What are you doing home, little mister? She'll tell you. He hasn't been sleeping. Well, can you blame him? Paul was everything to us. Nearly everything. Have you been seeing a therapist, Mom? I am not gonna go to a stranger to talk about my problems. I've gone through that before. You remember? Yeah, I do remember. How long have you been off your meds? Excuse me? Yeah. Do you think I wanted any of this to happen to me? What about Martin? Have you thought about him? Are you really gonna play the bad mother card with me? You, of all people, huh? Do you know what it's like to raise him without a father? Look how you turned out. I'm gonna give you a few days. And, until you stop being completely manic, - I'm gonna have Martin staying with me. - Mmm-mmm. - Yeah, it's what's gonna happen, Mom. - Mmm-mmm. And you can call me when you're feeling better. - Pack your bags. - No, no, no. I'm ready. Martin, no, no, no. Martin, please, please, please. - You planned this, didn't you? - Let's go. You planned this. We didn't plan anything, Mom. I'll be back as soon as I can. Remember to take your vitamins. Rebecca. - What's going on? - We're going home. No, no, no. Rebecca, please! I'm sorry, Mom. Okay. Here we are. You can take the bed. Or the couch, if you want. No. This is good. Okay. Cool. My God. This your idea? What do you mean? - Bringing the kid here? - Yeah, he's not safe there. So, you call the lady at the school. That's what CPS is for. Exactly this. - He's my brother. - And she's his mother. So? Are you doing this to help him or to hurt her? You should leave now. I know it's a little past dinner time, so we can call this a midnight snack. Do you want crust or no crust? Um, yeah, crust is fine. Can you make them triangles? Yeah. You're just like your big sister. I used to love that. All righty. There we go. Okay. That's good, it's not even... Oh! - Ow! - Sorry. You had a knot. Rebecca? Yeah? If Mom's crazy, does it mean we're crazy, too? No. Martin? Hey. What are you doing down there? You have to turn the light switch... Did you take Martin? - Uh... What? - Who is it? You can't do this. She's unstable. It's not a safe environment for him. - Where is he? - He's in there getting dressed for school. Look, think about what you wanna do. Yeah, I did, and I brought him here. I'm not talking about some knee-jerk reaction. He can't stay here. Sure he can. Not with... Rebecca, come on. You know why I'm here? She called me. So, Child Services takes orders from nutjobs now? I stopped by, in person, to make sure she was lucid. And she was. But, you know what? That's not how this works. Why not? Sophie's his birth mother. His legal guardian. To get Martin from her custody requires you to file charges against her. Take her to court. Now, that's a long, painful process. And that's only the first half. To keep Martin from being placed in foster care requires you to prove yourself and your home as an appropriate surrogate. That's two major choices for you to make. Declaring war on your mother and transforming yourself into a responsible guardian for him. You ready to do that? I can be a responsible guardian. It's okay. I got some sleep. I'll do better tonight. Hey. I got your text. What's up? Can you take me to my mom's? - Really? Gonna do this whole thing again? - Hey! What? No. I'll tell you about it in the car. What are you doing? Don't you think we should talk about last night? What? About how you kicked me out for being honest with you? Oh, um... Yeah. I'm sorry. You were right. I was using Martin to get to Mom. Thank you for pointing that out. - Can we... - Whoa, whoa. You should apologize to Martin. Not like that, but you should still apologize to the kid. I need to find out about Diana. The bitch is real. Wait. Who's Diana? Mom? All right, what are we looking for? You're looking for Mom. If you see her, we hit the back door. Got it? Got it. Patient 283 admitted October 6, 1984. The patient suffers from a unique skin disorder that manifests itself in an extreme sensitivity to light. Uh, patient's stay here has been very problematic. She has a history of violence and... Lately, she's been obsessed with one of the patients in the heliotherapy ward, a young girl named Sophie. Oh, bring her in. Keep her restraints on. Thank you. Hello, Diana. Keep the lights out. I hear you've been very bad again. Diana, I want you to stay away from Sophie. She's my friend. Then why did you hurt her? She was getting better. Session 13 now. Patient's skin condition is worsening. Uh, we're preparing an experimental... - Hold her down! - Please! Using full dosage now. 1200 watts. Shut it off! Now! Jesus... Bret! Bret! Stay away. Stay away, Becca. I won't be sent away again. You okay? What happened? We gotta go, okay? Your mom's here. We gotta go. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Oh, shit. - Oh, God. - Talk to me. What happened up there? I don't know. I was attacked. Yeah, by what? I don't know. I can't explain it. What's all this for? Proof. It's proof. I know, I'm just saying you can talk about your sister to me, okay? She's fine. Did you take your vitamins? Oh... I am feeling a little better. But, listen, bud. I know I've been a little distant lately, and I really wanna fix that. How about a popcorn and movie night tonight? Yes, please. Good. I think a little personal time is just what we need. All three of us. - Mom? - Huh? How about just you and me tonight? Okay? We'll see. Child, how can you see with all that light? Ah, now, that's better. Now be an angel and run along to Ito and tell him to bring me a very light breakfast. How you doing down there? I'm fine. How are you? I'm gonna be fine. I am. I miss your dad. He made me feel strong. He made me feel protected and I think I need to feel those things sometimes, you know? I think you do, too. I'm okay. Rebecca's strong. Uh, Rebecca acts like she's strong, and she is sometimes, but, let me tell you, when things got tough, she abandoned me. And I don't want that to happen to you. Sometimes the strongest thing to do is just to face your fears. That's what Emma told me. Yeah. I think you might be right. I'll be back. Mom? Hey, it's all right. It's okay, love. - Mom, what are you doing? - It's all right. Look at me, trust me, okay? I'm gonna tell you a story. Mom, please, please. Baby. It was a long time ago, and I had a friend named Diana. She was so different. So special. Look at me. And later, I found out something really bad happened to her. But the news... The news had it wrong, you see. And she was still there. And she finally came back. Mom, please... Please, let go. No, listen to me. See... See, I left her alone for so many years. I abandoned her. But now, she's going to stay, okay? As long as I keep my head clear and you keep the lights out. No! Martin! Martin, don't turn on the lights! Diana doesn't know any better. No, Diana! Diana! He doesn't understand! He didn't mean it! Martin, she didn't mean it. Please, don't do this. Wait. So your mom was in a mental institution when she was younger? Yeah. Yeah, looks that way. You just never talked about it, is all. Neither did she. I guess it's not really something that you talk about. Yeah, well, how about I just listen? Because I still don't know who Diana is. She's... It's getting worse. We need to go shopping, babe. Right. Um... Can you run to the store? Okay. Copy that. See you, bud. Hey. You wanna talk about it now? I know you don't believe me, but Diana is real. - She touched my hair. - Hey, hey, hey! Listen to me. I'm gonna tell you something that nobody ever told me. I believe you. I don't know what she is. She doesn't like the light. Okay. Come with me. Okay. So, it turns out that your dad was doing a lot of research into Mom and Diana's past. Diana was found in a basement, locked away when she was 13 years old. And her father had killed himself. She had a very strange skin disorder. There were stories about her. People used to say that she was evil and that she could get inside people's heads, change them. She was taken to Mulberry Hill Psychiatric Hospital, where she met Mom. And I think that she got inside Mom's head and made her think that they were friends. But they weren't? No. Diana only comes around when Mom is at her worst. I went through it too when I was your age. When your dad left? Yeah. So, what happened with Diana? The doctors tried an experimental treatment on her and something went wrong. And she died. But, if she's dead, how could she be doing this to us? I don't know. But, I think that Mom is the only connection Diana has to this world. You know, I think if we can get Mom better, get her mind strong again, then we can maybe break that connection. No. Diana won't let that happen. Why do you say that? Because that's what my dad was trying to do. Okay. It's the food. Hey. Bret? Stay there. Rebecca! Oh, God. Mom, we need to talk. What? Can you tell us about Diana? What are you talking about? Your friend. Diana. Martin said that she was here an hour ago. Yes. She's my friend. Is this your friend, Diana? Is this her? Where did you get this? Answer my question. No, you answer mine. You met Diana at Mulberry Hill when you were taken there for your depression. Am I right? - What does it matter when we met? - Am I right? What does it matter when we met? Because she died. She died a year after this photo. That's a lie. I don't know what you're saying. It's the truth, Mom. It's the truth. Stop. Okay, I understand. You are trying to take him away from me again. You're trying to take my son away from me again, so you're making up these wild stories. I found her obituary, Mom. Explain that! Those things can be faked! They can be faked! You sound crazy. Listen to her. I know, this all sounds a little crazy. There is a dead woman in this house and you let her in, Mom. You let her stay. I know. I see. I get it. You came because you feel bad about leaving me. Am I right? I didn't hear from you. You didn't come see me like most people. Do you know how much that hurt me? And now, as it turns out, I've been shutting Diana out the same way, all this time. And I am not gonna be a kind of person that does that to a friend. A friend? Mom, we're talking about a dead person. Oh... Sweetie, ghosts aren't real. Then what is she? Then what is she? You can sleep over at my place again tonight. I'll call CPS in the morning. No. What do you mean, "no"? Look, I know you've been gone a long time, but she's our mom. She needs us now more than ever. Hey. I'm not here for her. I'm here for you. You're my priority. I can't just leave her. Okay. But it's not safe here. It's not safe anywhere. How long does she usually stay up in her room at night? Mom? She doesn't usually come out again until morning. Okay, first priority, we put in some safeguards. Bret and I are gonna be on the couch downstairs. - Okay? - Okay. Do you want your door open or closed? Closed. Wait. Can you, uh... Can you sleep in here tonight? Sure. I just have to go tell Bret. I'll be right back. You don't have to stay, you know. I know. Martin wants me to sleep up in his room tonight. Yeah. He needs you more than I do right now. Yeah. Are you still gonna stay? Unless you say otherwise, yeah. Gonna be kind of hard sleeping with all these lights on. You must think we're all crazy. You know, I don't think that. Thank you. You can be this way around me. I'm not going anywhere. Bottom drawer. What? The, um... The bottom drawer. In the dresser. I will clean it out for you. - Seriously? - Mmm... Uh... Maybe. Okay. Good night. Good night. Mom? Uh, we're staying overnight. Okay. I'll see you in the morning. Love you. You're staying? Yeah. Good. Um, I was... I would like, maybe, tomorrow morning, to start over, if that's okay with you. Yeah. Of course. Did you ever hear from Dad? Letters or... No. I'm sorry. I wish I had. I really wish you had. I know you blame me, and I don't blame you for... No. I don't. It was his choice to leave, not yours. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Rebecca? Yeah? Did you find her medicine? No. But we'll figure something out. You think so? Yeah, bud. We'll make sure she gets better. Okay. Get some sleep. Shit. Come on. Bret. Bret! Shit. Shit. Come on. Rebecca! Rebecca? Rebecca? Rebecca? Rebecca? Come on. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Don't leave me again. - Okay. Ever! Hey, all right. Nothing's working. What else could it be? A trap. No! No! Hey! Help! Help! Bret! Let us out! Becks? - Let us out! - Becks! Bret! Bret, we're down here! All right, Becks, hold on. Mrs. Wells? No! No! Bret! - Bret! - Mrs. Wells? Stay in the light, Bret! Bret! All right, Becks, hold on. Ah! Okay. No! Bret! Bret? Bret, come here! Is he leaving? No. No, no, he wouldn't do that. You did. No! Come on! That one doesn't last long. We need to find more light. Rebecca? Hello? Martin? Diana, where are you? I told you not to hurt my children. They don't know any better. Do not threaten me, Diana. No, you need me, Diana! There's no you without me. Something that I should have never... How long are we gonna be in here? I don't know. There's no windows. Yeah. I'm working on a plan. I'm not much help to you. Hey. You're doing great. Okay? Keep looking through that box. Um... I found a flashlight. Or something. It's a black light. Still got some juice. Wait. Where are you going? To take inventory. Keep feeding the fire. Oh, God. Oh, my God. "Just like in the hospital. " "Trapped down here... " Holy shit! "Take Sophie away from me. " "Forget Diana." Let's go! I saw her. She doesn't disappear in this light. So? So, if we can see her, at least we know where she is. And maybe we can even hurt her with this. What now? Mom! - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! Are we gonna die? No. We're fighters. Do you hear me? We're fighters. She's in there, my girlfriend and her family. Sir, get back in your vehicle. You need to get to a hospital. - You need flashlights. - Get back in your car. Okay? Unit 81, we're at the Marigold house. Power grid is out, over. LAPD. Anyone home? Hello? LAPD. We're responding to the domestic disturbance. We're here! We're down here! Help! Diana! If you hurt my kids, we are never speaking again! Keep the light on us! Ma'am? Show yourself. Back off! Andrews? Oh, my God. Oh, God. Unit 99. Get me backup. Officer down. Here, take this. You won't see her otherwise. - Take it! - Stay back. Take it! - We have to go. - No, we have to get Mom! - No, we gotta go! - No, we're not leaving without Mom! Okay, I'll get her, I promise! Come on! Right now! Becks! Go! Go! Hey, come here, buddy. - Get him out of here. - No! - Let go of me! - I gotcha. Rebecca! I'm going to get Mom! Okay. Mom? Mom? Stay away. Or I'll show you where I put your father. I told you! Don't hurt my kids. Mom, she killed Dad! That won't hurt me. This will. There is no you without me. No! Mom, what are you doing? Saving your lives. No! Mom! I'm here, bud. I got you. Here you go. You came back. Of course. So did you. Yeah. No more running away. We're here to stay. Hey, it's okay. It's nothing. I got you guys, all right? Yeah. We're never going away. Come here.
