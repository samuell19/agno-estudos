"Parma. Parma train station." What are you doing? Are you getting off or not? "Direct train from Bologna now leaving from Platform 2." They said 320 instead of 360 because of the Common Market. - So, there was no deal? - Of course not. And you know what I told them? I don't give a damn about the Common Market. THE GIRL FROM PARMA - Who is it? - Amneris! Don't you recognize me? Dora, what a surprise! You remembered! Come up! Scipio, look who's here! Our dear Dora! I thought about you so much, I wondered what you were doing. - But come upstairs! - "And how, if you don't open the door?" Oh, right! I'll be right there, Dora! "Scipio, you should see her! She's become such a lady!" "Oh, stop that noise!" You've become so beautiful! Like a flower. The last time I saw you, you looked like a spider. But now, look at her, Scipio. She's a woman, now. It's been five years. You could have visited earlier. We're not that far from your hometown. Maybe 200 km, right, Scipio? My uncle wouldn't let me. Oh! How is he? Such a pious man, not like you, Scipio. But he is a priest. Now that you're here, you can't leave soon. We'll keep you here for at least a month. So you can have some fun, though Parma is no Paris. But you're still a little girl. Though your mother was your age when she got married. Poor woman! To die like that, so suddenly! So young! She changed so much after your father's death. Don't cry, Amneris. We were... close friends! She said they were close friends. Always together... young! They were always together when they were young. Do you like the opera? Opera, lyrical music... I don't know. Scipio will get us tickets to the Royal Theatre. And to go dancing, too. He works for the city. He makes drawings for them... what do you call that? Planimetry. Right, that... But if I ask him to measure curtains for me... He would never do it. Poor dear, don't wait for him! Eat some more, Dora! Now, he only plays at a club on Saturdays, but before! He used to play at home, full volume! To practice, he said. If it were an ocarina, okay, but a trumpet! Luckily, Mrs. Severini... you know, the pastry shop owner... In Cavour Street. Well, what did she do? Oh! She complained. So, we got fined 5,000 lire. She said if the neighbors complain again, they'll take the trumpet! It's good that you put it out on your first time. Maybe tonight you can smoke another one. If Uncle knew I let you do this, uh! - Tell me, do you have a boyfriend back home? - No. Well, and where could you find one? In the church? Father Colombo surely wouldn't let any men close to you. Besides, you're not meant for a country boy. Look at that cloud. It looks like an Arab on a camel. You're so careless. You think of clouds, after what we've just done. You make me angry... You're so funny. Now, you're ashamed? What should I say? It's always easier for a man. Right, for a man... not for a seminarian. You're only a priest when it's convenient for you. I'm not a priest yet. Maybe in two years, if all goes well. Well, it was meant to happen. So, calm down. But it shouldn't have happened to me. So, why did you come here? It was you, you called me! Me? I only asked if Uncle was there, and you rushed here. You hurt me, there was a stone under my back. Are you happy it was me? Come on, let's go. It's late. - I'll go first, on the scooter. - What about me? Should I walk? Well, we can't go back together. People would talk. Right, I wonder what they would think. Wait a few minutes, then go back. Get going! See you tomorrow at 9 am Mass. - I didn't see you tonight at Mass. - I was sitting in the back. Tell the truth. You came late and were hiding from me. I know where she was. Somewhere counting crickets again. She never helps at home... - Again with this story? - She's always out... That's true. I wonder what goes through that head of yours. Sometimes, it looks like you hear voices like Saint Theresa. And why didn't I see you at Mass tonight? Oh, right, I asked you already. - I'll go. - Good, or she'll say you don't do anything. I wonder if this is well cooked. - Dora! - What do you want? Someone saw us and talked. It was a mess at home... - "Who is it, Dora?" - It's Giacomo. "Oh, Giacomo! You weren't at Mass tonight, either! Come in!" Such hurry! I'm not going anywhere! I also wanted to ask you for another book. Sure! The few books I own are at your disposal! Take him to the studio, Dora. "This is the Vatican Radio. Discography of religious music..." Who saw us? - Berto, from the mill. - Ah, we're screwed! - He was setting traps nearby. - If only he got caught in one. Don't stand on the chair with your shoes on! Use the stool. He told everything to my aunt. Tomorrow, they'll send me back to my father. He'll beat me. I'm not going back. Okay, then what do you want to do? Listen, I've thought about this. - Let's elope. - What? - Yes, let's elope. Tomorrow morning, Father Colombo will know, and you'll be sent away. He already did that, and I had to repeat three years. But he'll do something. Come on, let's elope. What about the seminary? After what I did? And besides, I don't think it's right for me. And where should we go? Who cares? When people elope, they don't know where to go. Well, we'll need money. The money for the seminary. Take St. Thomas' "Treaty on Miracles"! - What do I care about St. Thomas? - Shh, he's coming. - Did you find anything? - Yes, I'll take this. Good, lets see. Are you kidding? This is the Mass schedule. "A girl like you, in that country town. It must have been so boring." But now, I'll make it fun for you. - No, I'm good. - Come on. Go rest, now. Come. Should we clear the table? You didn't come to be a maid. Come, I made the bed for you. I'll wake you up when I get back from work. What work? I started being a nurse again. For the money... and to go out a bit. Bye, sweetie, sleep well. - Amneris. - Yes? - I'm so happy to be here. We're the happy ones! Act as if this were your home. Your poor mother would be so... What a good girl. So simple and well mannered. She's a rare breed. See how she eats? Such an appetite! That's natural, she's growing. You should see her in her underwear. Such beautiful, long thighs. Maybe she lacks some breast size, but they're so perky. Ah, youth! Me, too, remember? You called me "the bomb." But I still look good, huh, Scipio? Right, goodnight. Dora, are you sleeping? Good God! Look who's there! She was a cleaning lady. Remember, Scipio? Her husband was a cobbler, then he got his own business. And now look, she wears her mink coat even to the toilet. And they've even got a white car with a driver. Thanks, Italo. You put cream at the bottom, right? Of course, ma'am. Scipio, pass me the thermos from my purse. - And fill it all the way this time. - Yes, ma'am. - Scipio, you know who's sitting behind you? - Who? - Mrs. D'Ottavi. - So? She's separated from her husband, the one who makes cheese. - Do you remember her? - I think I went to school with her daughter. They broke up because the husband had an affair with a secretary. The secretary was... easy, let's say. I wonder who the man is. Scipio, you know who he is? How could I? I can't see him! If you don't turn, how can you see? What do you care, I don't get it... Good evening. Look how you make me look bad. Why? Do you know him? Of course I do, he's the engineer in my office! - And what's wrong with looking? - Whatever. - Better here than in your country town, huh? - Yes. - Who are you looking at? - Nobody. At least, you see beautiful people here, Dora. And the music is better, too. Now, you even fall. - You see how they... are? - Yes, they're sitting, good for them. But they're... naked. So what? They're at the beach. This way, you know their bodies better than mine. Nothing. Try this other one. If this is full, too, I'll just sit here forever. - Excuse me, I was... - You're wrong, boy, I'm a guest here. - Can I help you? - Yes, thanks. I was looking for Mr. Santini. - He isn't here. - Thanks. Goodbye. What is it? This one's no good, either? No, but it's full. Come on, they can't be all full! Of course we have rooms, it's the start of the season! A double? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Please, come in. And my scooter? Who'd take it? People leave their Jaguars out here. - Giacomo... - Yes? - I want a sandwich... what about you? Do you only think about food? I can't believe you're so thin. It's all so easy for you. A sandwich, the restaurant, the hotel... Is it my fault if I'm hungry? Well, look here. 2,000 lire without a bathroom. With all our problems, you think about a sandwich? Okay, enough, I get it... mean. You never think that I was about to become a priest, huh? Since we're not eating, can I at least sleep? Sometimes, I envy you. Right now, they're all back at the seminary. Well, right now, they're all sleeping... they're lucky. If I went back tomorrow, I'd still be in time. But I wouldn't do that, right? Tomorrow, I'll write to the director. Do you think he'll understand? If I explain that a man like me, who has tried life to the fullest, can't just live "sic at sempliciter," what do you say? Come in! Good morning, ma'am. I thought I'd wake you up. - What time is it? - Just past 11 am. - The young man left. - When? - Early this morning. - Do you need anything? - No, thanks. "I'm going back to the seminary, forgive me. "I'm leaving you 10,000 lire for..." "When I was young, it was different... but today, you have to keep moving." Look around, get some experience, or you'll get to 20 and... Dora, don't look at her like that! Don't stare like that! And uncross your legs. Put that knee down. - Do you know her? - Me? Of course not! - And you, Scipio? - Me? - Even if he did, he wouldn't say. What do we know, she has a wedding ring. She must be waiting for her husband. Oh, I have to go. I have an injection to do at 11:00. Once every two hours, I'll be out all night. And what will you do? Will you sleep? No, I can't. I'll read... I can come keep you company. No, being up all night isn't good. Go home with Scipio. What? As you prefer. - Good night, ma'am. - Good night. - Goodbye. The door! Do they always have bingo outdoors here? Of course! Last month, Mrs. Medioli won 100,000 lire! So, Scipio, let's go home alone, like a couple of lovers. Look, he wasn't that much more handsome when we got engaged! Lies. At the time, I was a really good-looking guy. But if you like, she can go with you. I wouldn't mind, but I want her to rest. - But I'm not tired, Amneris! - Then, go with her. - Okay. Thanks, handsome man. - Good night. - Good night, Scipio. Lovers. One shouldn't joke about that. He's traveled all over the world. For work, he says. Excavations, catacombs, columns... and all that kind of stuff. But one can't work while traveling... That's a lie by people with money. And he has a lot of money. Does he live alone? He came back from one of his travel without his wife. An accident, he says. But you never know. Can you turn it on? Yes, let's see what's on. Turn it off, it's commercials. No, leave it on! I like it. It looks so easy, now... but some people worked hard to create it. - Not everybody can be a "hidden persuader." - A what? Those people who study consumers' psychology and make them buy things. It must take time to find the right idea. And then, someone steals it... and bye-bye. Well, you can sue them... Who? The advertising company. But how do you prove it was your idea? And they're such jerks. They might accept your idea... But first, you have to find a woman they like, who'll sleep with them. Dora, what are you talking about?! Nothing... I've read that in a book. Uh... I thought that you read prayer books, at church. "Ma'am!" There, he's awake. I'm coming! "Did you rest for a bit? Now, let's check your temperature. "Count, what are you doing? Be still. "No! What do you think you're doing? Tomorrow, I'm telling the doctor. "Be quiet! I said no!" He's better tonight. He's more lively. Oh, the news. Are you interested? No, you can turn it off. Now, take some chocolate. Have you ever cheated on Scipio? What did you say?! Yes, have you been with someone else? Dora, what the hell? Do you think I'm that kind of woman? No, but it can happen. Sure, of course. But then, it's up to the woman. As a nurse, I have to be kind. Last year, a lawyer, sick with colitis... gave me this expensive watch as a present. Gold, of course. Then, Scipio, I don't see him very often... But even when we're together... But I shouldn't speak like this with a young girl. Here, this one will look great on you. I made it two years ago, but it looks new. Here, there aren't many chances to dress up. You're built differently, but it'll be easy to take in. Try it on. Do we really have to go to this dance? We're fine here. Maybe after dinner we could go to the bar. I don't understand you! If only I had this chance as a girl! But look, it's not right! Of course, with that attitude! But let me fix it. I'll make it perfect, you'll see. Then, at your age, whatever you wear looks great. How much is that? I have no idea. What do you think? - Excuse me, aren't you... - No, I'm not. But I recommend you buy it anyway. It would look great on you. Sure, but I don't know how much it is, and I... Buying without money is always hard. Unless you find someone willing to buy it for you. And this "someone" would be you? Let's see. What if I bought it for you? Then, I'd take it, and I would thank you. If I were Santa Claus, that would even work. But since I'm not, I can get it for you, on one condition. Which I'm not going to accept. That's too bad. I'm not Santa Claus, but I'm also not an evil ogre. My condition is pretty acceptable. I'll buy it for you, but you'll put it on in front of me. Of course. Perhaps at your place? No, the cabana works, too. Hmm. Only if you keep your sunglasses on. Take your time, I'm in no hurry. But you said you'd keep your sunglasses on. There's no sun here, darling. Listen, if you come closer, I'm going to scream. But I'm a gentleman. I knew it. I'm sorry, but we had an agreement. Find someone else! "This is the Child Search Service. A child has gone missing. "3 years old, French, named Jean-Pierre. "He's wearing a blue and red bathing suit. He's blond with blue eyes." Quick service, Miss. Here is your broth. Could I have my bill? Certainly. Are you leaving us today, Miss? - Yes, I think so. - That's too bad. 14,200 lire? I thought it would be 8-9,000, at most. - There are additional taxes for staying. - What? And the service. But I only have these... See if that's enough. And if it's not enough... I'm not sure what to do. Well, I'll tell my boss. That's all. - Do you like it, Miss? - My favorite meal ever. - I have your bill here. - I know, I don't have enough money. But there was a mistake. Oh, I knew it! I don't want you to mistakenly think I'm so attached to money. - Even the additional tax! - Well, it's the law. - Maybe we can find a way. - To avoid the additional tax? That, and the rest. Why do you want to leave so soon? You should stay longer, with this nice sun. Is the Ministry of Tourism paying you? Perhaps later, we can... study the situation together. And what if I didn't want to study the situation with you? Then, I'd be sorry to remind you that the bill is 14,200 lire. And since you were left alone, I billed you for a single room, as a favor. And it's six days that you've only eaten vegetable creams and broth. Give me the menu. - Luigino, serve the lady, immediately! - The usual broth? Don't discuss it with me, and bring the menu! Here is the menu. - Let's start with appetizers. - Which appetizers? All of them. Then, lasagna, steak, potatoes... lobster, fruit, dessert, and an ice cream. And bring me a double portion of tripe, too! Do you like tripe? No, I don't. But he does! "Let's cut off these straps. See, it looks better!" Isn't it a bit too low cut? What do you mean, have you seen how other girls dress? You'll see, tomorrow night. Let's go ask the man of the house. Scipio, how does she look? It's a good dress. As if this was the first time you saw it. I've had it for two years. He wouldn't look at me even if I walked around naked. She says it's too low cut. No, I don't think so. See? Give it to me, I'll fix it in five minutes! Can't you go in the other room? - Goodness! - I'll bring it in a few minutes. Sorry for bothering you! She's just a little girl. Who cares where she gets undressed? - "Good night, Dora!" - "Good night!" Turn it off soon, please. Amneris... Scipio, what are you doing? Come on... What's with you tonight? - Come here... - Hmm, no... Dora might hear us. Dora, Dora... what does she have to do with us? Good evening. Mrs. Bodoni and her husband. I gave her 12 injections. She seems so put together, but when you see her upside down... And she has so much cellulite! Don't lean like that! Pull yourself up, sit straight! Is she a relative of yours? It's as if she were. She came to spend a few days in Parma. Beautiful girl, my compliments. Thank you so much. She's so envious, she and that ugly daughter of hers! Would you like to dance? Me? But I can't... Thank you. Why did you refuse? You should have said yes. Should I have left you here alone? He's a very nice guy though, huh? - Miss, may I...? - Sure. You worried about the low cut? Look at that girl. It looks like she's breastfeeding him. - Well, she's too forward. - That's for sure. The two ice creams, here! We paid extra. Mrs. Pagliuchi, didn't you have a similar dress? No, mine had a different pattern. And the skirt's shape was different, too. Scipio can't remember what I wore this morning, and this one remembers after two years. Wasn't your daughter engaged? Yes, but she didn't want him anymore. These modern girls, you know... Of course! It was him that left her, after he found out that their factory was in debt, not the other way around. Our trumpeter! They're looking at you! All of them are looking, now. There's one who's eating you up with his eyes. Look, the third man from the left. Looks like a Swedish man. You could smile, you know. Men must be encouraged. Discreetly, of course. I wonder what he does. A boring policeman, I bet. He's coming! Hopefully not. - He wants to dance with you, too. - Of course not! - Ma'am, may I invite this young lady to dance? - Of course. - But the ice cream will melt... - Come on! You know who that young man is? Last month, he danced with my daughter... he's a policeman. Right? Girls, today! Sometimes, they understand things right away. Would you like to dance, now? - Should we get an ice cream, too? - Why not? Why'd you ask me, with all these beautiful young women around? In Montechiarugolo, where I'm from, we like mature women! You're a bunch of Casanovas, in Montechiarugolo! Pardon my curiosity, do you live in Parma? But you are from Parma, right? - I can hear it. - But I didn't even speak. Well, I can hear it... in your eyes. - Do you like these modern dances? - Not the bossanova, or twist, or madison. Why? You look so dynamic. - Because there's no contact with the woman. - You're obsessed! Instead, I'm from Enna. Smile! - Really? - Yes, but I've been in Parma for nine months, for my job. - I'm a policeman. - Is that right? - I'm a registered nurse. - Nurse? Do you go to patients' houses, too? Of course, should I have sick people come to my house? - Scipio, I'm here. - Do you know him? - He's my husband. - Does he play the trumpet? - That, too. - Yesterday, we suppressed a demonstration. - Did you suppress it? Of course. And to think that in Rome they want to take away our weapons. But you know what I say to them? "Police unarmed, criminals encouraged!" Do you like that? Fitting, right? "With our air condition systems, fresh air at any time!" - The slogan on top, the girl below, posing... on the unit, of course. For the lower unit, the girl with her legs crossed. What do you think, engineer? See, I'm pretty experienced in advertising, by now. You need to 'hit' the audience in the gut. For example, an ice column, to advertise your units. An ice column! And inside, a naked woman. - Right, so I lose my clients in the Vatican. - Oh, right. Well, if they don't like the ice column... No, it's the naked woman that's the problem. Of course, let's drop that! I can find a million better ideas. For example: the top of a mountain, with a beautiful girl lying down. You're really obsessed with girls! - I'm obsessed, huh. - What did you say? Well, engineer, no women, then what? A monk? This guy never laughs. For the Vatican, what if the girl is dressed? A girl like Silvana, for example. See how refined she looks? - Do you know her? - Do you want me to introduce you? - Well, if she's your friend... - Silvana! I'll go call her, I think she can't hear us with the waves. Damn you! - Come here. - Are you talking to me? - Of course, come. My name isn't Silvana. I know, but just pretend it is and that you know me. I'll explain later. Please wave at him. - But I don't know you. - Then, wave to be nice. I told you I'll explain. Please wave to that big guy sitting on the beach chair. Please. Listen, why did this engineer make us come here? And where else? He's on holiday, he doesn't have an office here. Did he say that I should come, too? Of course. The whole advertising campaign's centered on you. He'll have to get to know you, right? Why so many questions? I brought you to a nice place! - Do you want one? - What if he finds out? So what? That's why they're here. Hello? Yes, it's the engineer's room. Let me ask. Engineer! Engineer! - What is it? - The barman asks if you want that bottle of whiskey. Yes, have it sent up. Hello, yes, send it up. Listen, also some sandwiches, brioche, anything. Yes, anything. Send them up. - A soup, too? - Look, I haven't eaten in two days! And not because I'm trying to lose weight. At my hotel, if I don't pay, they don't let me eat. And I don't pay. You solved it in your way with the owner, but I... You're such a jerk! I shouldn't have told you that. - Here, jerk. - Even this is good. It takes him so long to wash that huge body. Remember that your name's Silvana. Dear Miss, forgive me, I'm a slave to my routine. If I don't shower at least three times a day, I get nervous. Oh, me, too... me, too. Nervous. You know, Miss Silvana, you look much younger up close. She's of age, though. You know, for advertising laws. If she's underage, we might run into problems... As I promised, engineer, I brought my drafts. - This is Silvana... for now, I used a picture of Brigitte Bardot. I'll make the final versions at home, in Rome. Here, below, see? This is your air conditioning unit. Next to the girl, the slogan: "She takes your breath away, Masselli gives it back!" This is more conservative, for the Vatican. Silvana with a coat. Slogan: "It's May 8th, Mother's Day. Give mom an air conditioning unit!" Okay, okay, contact my Press Department. I also prepared a letter for Dr. Lucari. Oh, already, great! Miss, do you live alone here in Riccione? No, I'm staying with my uncle, he has a hotel here. - Uncle? What do you know? - Nothing, must be a distant uncle... The estimate! I forgot to bring the estimate! What can we do? The estimate is the most important thing. - Where did you leave it? - In my hotel... I got distracted. You know what? Don't worry, I'll run there now and grab it. If that's okay with you. Really? Great. In 30 minutes, I'll be back. Take your time. You leave me in great company, after all. Right, Miss Silvana? Of course, of course. I'm going then! Excuse me. I'm coming with you. What? Silvana, stay here with the engineer. - I'll be back soon. - You stay here with the engineer! I'm sure you two will have fun! Silvana, what are you saying? What do you mean? First, my name's Dora. And then, you men are so boring. You could have come up with a better excuse... The estimate, ha! But Miss, I really don't know what you're talking about. - You're talking to... - A pig and a liar. Goodbye! Dora... Silvana! Wait a second! She got nervous... You know, her first night... Get out! What do you mean? I did all we agreed on... Get out! That letter, could you... Oh, right, here's your letter. Is it my fault she ran away? It's because you disgust her! Silvana! Excuse me, is this for the engineer? Well, I'll take these, I ordered them! Silvana! Silvana, Dora! Dora, wait for me! So, you left there, with nothing. Are you happy? Is it my fault he liked you? If he liked me, I would've said yes! That's where I'm at! I've been humiliated many times. Oh, you don't talk, of course! What do you care, right? - I'm hungry! - And I'm not?! Damn it all! What should I do? I was born unlucky! Everybody's making money. This "Boom," this Italian miracle... Maybe because I don't go to Church, but I wasn't part of the miracle! You still won't talk, huh? You think I did this for myself? Because I wanted to have sex with you? I didn't even touch you! Here, I only have one left. Eat it, or I'll eat this one, too! - Damn, you're so ugly! - Why? Last year, I was at the Spoleto festival, on duty. I kept my eyes open, but there was no problem. Hello, Scipio. Here, people are more modern, I can see that. Girls don't have as many prejudices here as they do down South. Where do you like it better? Miss, your question is specious. A single man likes it better here... Please, don't ask me my phone number. - Then, tell me where I can find you. - That's not a good idea... You're such a Casanova, if I weren't so responsible... - Be still! - Tell me your name, at least. Then, I'll find you. No, I said I wouldn't say anything. Why don't you listen to me? You insist because you don't know me. With Amneris Pagliuchi, it doesn't work. - Got it? - Thank you. - One is married, the other single... - Who are you talking about? - My sisters. - Oh, I see. Adele was going to get married this year, but I forbade it. And why? I was on leave last October, and one evening I found her with him... - Naked? - Hah, no, they were kissing. - Just kissing? - Yeah, but I made them stop thinking about it. I'm built and big, so... He's been standing there since this morning. Well, he'll leave sooner or later. That one? He does that on his job, he might stay there for days! - For me, he can stay there for years. - Really? - And if he leaves for real? - Great, all I want is to be left in peace. To be at peace, you should be with a man. His salary will come every month. Then, love, too. But love, if it's not there, it will come... and if it's there, it will go away. At least, look at him! He looks like a streetlight pole. Even dogs will start pissing on him soon, ha ha! Respectfully, of course. Come on, silly girl. Looking won't cause any harm. Try at least to appreciate his perseverance! He's so cute, he looks like a figure on a playing card! Thank you, Miss Dora, to have accepted my invite to go out. Yesterday, I wasn't under your windows because I had to go out of town. Oh, I thought you had given up waiting. Miss, you don't know me, then. Want to know what your Michele did yesterday? It's in the newspaper, with my name. Here, read! "Agents Giordano Tizzetti, Marco Falcone and Michele Pantano' "were injured and required medical attention." Rocks were thrown at us, ma'am. - Oh, and what did you do? - I passed out. Do you want to feel the lump? Here, feel. Impressive, huh? - What about your helmet? - A thug grabbed it. But you know what I was thinking of, in the moment of danger? Well, maybe to hide? Of you, Miss Dora. I wondered whether you'd accept to go out with me. And whether you'd understand my respectful feelings. At that moment, I got hit. I'm sorry, it's late now. I didn't want to come out... No, please, wait, Miss Dora! I know I can't immediately hope to know what you think, but I'd like to harbor some hope. Miss Dora, I'm confident that one day you'll love me back. I've searched for so long, but now I feel that I've found my soul mate. You're probably wrong, keep looking. Don't talk like that. I can wait. "Rent a boat: 200 lire per hour" I'm happy just being next to you, breathing the same air. I feel stronger, braver, everything! Miss Dora, to be honest, when I'm with you I feel so powerful... Listen to me, Miss Dora... When I'm with you... I feel so powerful, that I could row for hours! All for you. I'd take you far, far away... Where are you going?! Be careful! Oh, great. I'm so sorry. I felt I had wings on my arms. This proves the honest, yet deep passion I feel for you. I must marry you, Miss Dora. Don't you believe that I'm serious? I'm more than serious! I'm not one of those men without morals... without qualms, who lure women and take advantage of them. Dora! Dora! Sometimes, you just get lost. What's up with you? We need to do another, it's out of focus. "What did you say?" It's out of focus! We need to retake it! - Oh, no, Nino! - What, no? You immediately moved! Last year, I had a model who would stay still for hours! Then, I realized she slept with her eyes open, like an owl. - So, I woke her up and kicked her out. - Good for her. Come on, hurry up. So we can finish the water advertisement. Nino, you're killing me with all these photos. Couldn't you get another job? "Right, another job. I'm the best ad photographer in Rome!" - Nino, I'm hungry! - Of course! I was worried you hadn't said it yet! After this, I'll go down to the restaurant. Do these bells always ring in Rome? Of course. There are 10,000 churches. And bells are ads for churches. A smart idea that's been working for 2,000 years! It's worth millions! I had an idea like that once, for "Biu" shampoo. All the telephones, when ringing, instead of going "tuu, tuu, tuu"... Which has no meaning, were going to go "biuu, biuu, biuu." - Isn't that a great idea? - Sure, it's good. - And it didn't work? - No! The phone company wouldn't allow it. Show the brand. Where is it? I can't see it. Oh, here it is. Stay still, like that. Dora, open your eyes. Dora. Open your eyes! You look like a blind woman. You look like this... look. Don't be like that, you look gross. Gross? So, if I looked like this, you wouldn't have liked me. I already don't really like you when you're normal. Ah! So kind. But what about the artist's eye? Huh? See, you can even laugh! Now, go fix your hair, so it flows around. - Where's that magazine? - Which one? Who knows? There was a light effect on a bottle... damn it. In a beer advertisement. Oh, here it is! The Russians might get to the Moon first, but in advertising, the Americans are far ahead! They're good, damn good! "Hidden persuaders," they're called! Here. "There's a Ford in your future." - What? - There's a Ford in your future. A million dollar idea, my dear. But here it's impossible. Me, I should go to the US! Now, let's set the legs. People drink water, but they want to see legs! Place the knee here. Now, put your butt back a bit. No, make your butt a bit sexier, like this... Open this leg a bit... A bit more... Maybe it's a bit too pornographic? No, it's good, come on! The hair is good, it's flowing. See, it looks better! Now, let's lower this strap... Here, show me. Okay, like this is good. Does that tickle? And here? With you, it's impossible to work... - No, no, stop! - No... - No, get to work, Nino! - No, be quiet... - Stop it! Are you out of your mind? I had pleurisy! With this cold... I'm even under the fan, damn it! That's good though, we have to work here. Come on, pose! - Now, drink and laugh. - Well, either I drink or I laugh! Pretend, come on! Just bring the bottle close to your lips, like this. Come on, show the label. What matters is the brand! Let me put the bottle in focus. Great framing! Stay like that! "With Iron Water, your liver will rest!" Perfect! You'll see, they'll buy this one. And then, we'll be famous, one contract after the other. "Who did the ad for Iron Water?" "Nino Meciotti!" "Let's call Meciotti" "Yes! And where is he?" "Meciotti! Come, they're looking for you!" "Here's, Meciotti. I'm really busy." Our job is like that, you know. One hundred bad ideas... And then, like that, you can buy a car! Dora, there's a Fiat in our future! There! Let's eat, let's eat... - Pretty one! How much is this rose? - For you, 100 lire! Wait, I'll bring them in a second. "That seat is taken." - A floral homage to Miss Iris. - Thank you. Is there something wrong, Iris? No, everything's fine with me. What about you? You're formal with me even when whispering? - Of course, with a stranger... - Me, a stranger? I told you, lately I've been very busy with work. But see, as soon as I can, I come to say hello. - Yes, precisely at meal times. - Why, is it now...? I didn't even think about it, go figure. Iris, I come here for you. Even a rock would get it, by now. Ma'am, it's 600 lire. I saved you a seat. Sit down. Thanks, but I can't stay. I've got to get back to my studio. - Today, too? - Yes... - Who's up there waiting for you? Me? Nobody, I'm all alone, developing photos... I don't even have time to eat! About that, if you can have my usual packet prepared... So to justify my visit here. - You know what I'll do? - What? When I close, I'll come up to your place. - No, are you out of your mind? - See? No, Iris, try to understand. If you come up, goodbye work. I'd love that, really. But I have a deadline, get it? One of these days, I'll come up to you. Happy, now? Priamo, pack four suppli' and a calzone for Mr. Meciotti. - And the marinated lattarini fish? - And a few lattarini. - All right. - What are you looking at? You forgot the lattarini. You don't love me like you used to. - Would you like a suppli, Miss? - Thanks. I'll grab another one, so we're even. Pretty one! Dora, here! It smells so good. This one, too, though... - Oh, God! - What? - Nino! What did you do? - Where? Ah, damn it. Where can you find anyone more unlucky than me? Damn it, damn it! - Take them off, I'll clean them. - No, don't worry, eat. - What about you? - Don't worry, I already ate. Here we'd need the... what's the name... baby powder. Now, a halo will remain. They're also really ruined. What do you say, should I try? Well, I should try. I should get a winter suit... Right. If the job goes well... Though my first expense should be a new lens... Which costs 50,000 lire. And when will they come? In the year of the donkey? I keep working like this... While others are smarter and work less. And they all get by, by cheating. Of course, it "broke." Uh? What does that mean? It means that there's a hole. They gave up. Goddammit! Everything's always going wrong. It'll be 37 years of wrong next month! - Oh, best wishes! - Dora, I have bad luck glued on me. What wishes?! And I work hard. I even wake up at night. I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. "Kissing with Luce Nord is not a sin" didn't work. And the fans? I proposed: "The world is beautiful because it's airy," and nothing. I even went to an airline, I had a slogan to get more passengers. "You only pay if you arrive." He sent me away, saying I brought bad luck. Then, when finally you have a good idea, somebody steals it... and bye! Ma'am, "there's magic in your smile!" was mine! And they never paid me! I could sue them, but good luck proving it was my idea. I'm a loser, that's the reality. Sometimes, I even think of... What am I doing here, anyway? I should end it all. - Dora! - Nino, no! - No? Look! - Look what? There! Malalaica Street, seen from above. Great framing! "Go on, walk! At home, MobilRelax Armchair is waiting for you!" You're really crazy! For a moment, I was scared! Hurry! This is really a million dollar idea! "My heart is in my hands, Miss Dora. Believe me when I say... "that I've never spoken like this to a woman before. "Here, in this boat, my future is decided." I'm not looking for an easy adventure, but for a home, a family. That's how serious my proposal is. Do you understand, Dora? Yes, I understand. Ow! It stings, you're hurting me! - Why do you wear it like that? - What? - Your moustache. Since I was 15... my father wears it like this, my brothers, too. It's good to see people like that old man. Old-fashioned, still sensitive to the beauties of nature. - Maybe you prefer me without it? - What? - My moustache. How could I know? Listen, Michele, this is pointless. I'm not made for you. What are you talking about? You're a perfect copy of my ideal bride. I wanted her beautiful, and you're really beautiful. I wanted her pure, and you're really pure. That's what matters. A bride for me must be a virgin. - Why did you shave it? - My moustache? It was for you, remember? You looked better with it. Did it scare you? No, it's just that if I'd known that you were home alone... When you told me to come up, I wouldn't have... It could be compromising, if your parents were late to come home... Oh, they're not coming home at all. Amneris has a night shift, and Scipio is playing 30 km from here. Then, why did you invite me upstairs? - To tell you, dear Michele... - Dora! You've switched to an informal tone! To tell you that all patience runs out, with time... - And mine is long gone! - But, Miss Dora... I see that drinking was a bad idea. I'll leave. No! If you leave now, you'll be back tomorrow. How is that you want your wife, huh? Pure, a virgin, and then? Tell me... - Honest. - Right, honest. Then, a dishonest woman isn't good, right? You wouldn't talk to her, look for her. Well, Pantano', I'm neither honest, nor pure, or a virgin. So, go away! - Hah, you're joking... - I'm dishonest, corrupted, lost! Got it? See, you drank. You should go to bed, and tomorrow... I'll put it in writing for you. I've already had sex. - With a man? - With two. - Miss Dora! - With three, with four! Don't say it, I don't believe you! With five, and I can keep going. You only say that to hurt me! To push me away! But I won't fall into your trap! I don't believe you! I knew that, you're so stubborn. Well, then, that's why we're here, right? Dora, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind? What are you doing to me? To your Michele? These bad, evil things. You're lying. I won't touch you. You'll be my lady, I have to be respectful. You're pure, pure and beautiful. With these arms, and these shoulders... Dora... Swear that this isn't true. That you didn't deceive your Michele. Your Michele, who is desperate... Who loves you, who wants you... Dora... Oh, God... Do you believe me, now? And I wanted to come here, with a bunch of flowers... To ask you officially... Well, we dodged that bullet. I talked to you about family... My lady... Come on. There are many girls out there. I'm sure you'll find one for you. - One that hasn't yet... - Whore! - Yes, exactly. - Leave the pillow alone. - Whore! - You said that already. Well, I'll say that again. I'll say it again! No! From now on, forget about it. That's it, got it? And now, Pantano', please leave. Come on. No. First, I want to pay you, whore. How much? Who's that... who's there? - "Dora are you there? Answer!" - Hurry up! I was sleeping! You came back early! "Yes! Good party. All really drunk. Can I?" - Amneris is out. - "That's why I'm saying to let me come in. - "Let me in!" - Him, too, huh? - Can't you hear that he's drunk? - Dora, come on! Don't you know I think about you every night? Even at work. - What's with him? - He's horny. Go! - I'll kill him. - Move! - No, first I must pay you, whore. How much? - Oh, go to Hell! Ha, I broke all the glasses! I hit the cupboard! Too bad! - Come on, go to bed. - I'm not sleepy. - Do you want me to play you something? - No! - Hey, where are you going? - What? I'm a policeman, I was out on duty. - Here's my police I.D. - Let's see. - Do I look like a thief? - Oh, okay, sorry about that. - Good night, colleague. - Colleague? Whatever. Dora, come on, let me in. Just for a moment. I won't bother you! I've had an idea. Let's kill Amneris, and let's go abroad, the two of us. Think about it, I said it. Scipio, I asked you to pass the salt! Scipio! - Here. - Thanks. What's with you this morning? Is anything wrong? What should I say, I stayed up all night working. While I was giving the wife an injection, the husband fainted. He fell like a sack of potatoes. Ha! When did this guy come home last night? I don't know, I didn't hear him. Good job, drink more! Instead of a trumpet, he played the bottle! Dora, go get the door, please. And this morning, when I woke him up, he looked dead! You should be more responsible, with a young girl at home. Dora, I'm a finished man. I'm going to marry you, anyway. - What? - I'll marry you, anyway. Oh, no... I'll marry you, I don't care. Well, I do care, but I'm a finished man. My blood is on fire, I have a volcano inside me. - "Dora, who is it?" - It's Pantano'. - "Ah, Mr. Pantano', let him in!" - Go away, idiot. "Please, come in." Oh, thanks, such beautiful flowers. Why do you stand still? Come in. Close the door. "Scipio, see who came to visit? Mr. Pantano'." Get up, don't be rude. Please, come in, sit down. Look what beautiful flowers Mr.Pantano' brought us. Come on, you know I'm allergic. Excuse us, we were eating lunch. Would you like to join us? I'm not hungry, thanks. Sure. What brings you here? I'm a finished... I mean, I am honored to be here to... You know the seriousness of my intentions... From that first encounter on the 10th of this past month. Toward... Miss... Sorry, Mr. Pantano', I'm a woman, I had already figured this out. But in a way, we expected this, right, Scipio? Now, we have to see what her uncle, Father Colombo, will say. I'm sure he'll be happier than us. He's Dora's tutor. I'm sure he'll want to officiate the wedding, himself. It would be appropriate though, right, Scipio? I don't give a damn about Father Colombo! Well, now let's see what Dora thinks. She has the last word, after all. Dora... Dora agrees. Really, Dora? What do you say, Scipio? Me? What does it matter what I say? I don't know. Maybe... you're still a bit too young. So... You really think that? What does he know about a girl? So, Dora, you haven't answered Mr. Pantano' yet. I don't think it's a good idea for you. What if I don't change? Why on Earth would you have to change? Mr. Pantano' loves you as you are! Is it true, Michele? I accept. I offer you a respectable, comfortable, and quiet life. Did you hear? It's exactly what you were looking for! I'm so happy you listened to me. She spoke a lot about you, you know? There aren't many girls like my Dora. You're a lucky man, I can assure you that. Dora, my child, my angel, my dear girl! What did she say? Dora's poor mother, how she would be moved... Mr. Pantano'. See, they honor you and respect you. You're my fiancee, now. - See how they greet you? - If you knew how they greeted me before! Have you been with a policeman, too? Absolutely not, I could never stand policemen! What are you saying? It's not my fault I hate your lot, breaking into houses... - Arresting people... - Arresting? What are you talking about? Listen, Michele, I agreed to marry you because I want to live quietly. It's better if I leave Scipio's house now and go back to my uncle's... Well, you understand. But I don't know if I'll be a good wife. I honestly don't know. I once met a guy who married a prostitute, one from a brothel. - She became a great wife. - Oh, thanks! - Respectable, faithful... And you'll be only mine. Got it? Only mine. Just looking at your mouth, I'm going crazy. - Come. - What are you doing? Are you crazy? Just one kiss. Then, we'll go back. Don't hold me like that, it looks like you've arrested me. - That's Dora! - She's shameless! - I wouldn't even let her in. I've always lived waiting for this moment, and I've always hoped for it. And since it's not only a soul, but a dear niece of mine... coming back to the right way, I am doubly moved. We are also moved, Reverend. Thanks to your confession, my dear, I now know more than I did before. In the years you've lived here, you got to know sin. But what matters the most to the Lord is that you renounced sin... by marrying him. You'll see that even with his precarious job, Nino will make you... No, Uncle! Nino is the guy from advertising! He's the policeman! - Michele Pantano'! - Right. You'll see that Michele, with his good job... Father, I can't find the axis to the Cross. - How can you lose a cross? - No, not the cross, the axis. Whatever it is, look in the wardrobe! I'll be right there and... Go, go! I have a funeral waiting for me. Well, we're only on Earth temporarily... Earthly life is made of this: weddings, funerals, sad things, happy things... Thank you, Reverend. If Dora is truly repenting, as all demonstrates, then where would she be safer than between the law of God and the Earthly laws? What are you talking about, Father? - Isn't this the policeman? - Yes! Have faith, son, the last ones will be first! Well, let's hope so. - "Didn't she run away?" - "Look how she's dressed!" - "She got the city's attitude." - "A whore's attitude, you mean!" Train R2, arrives in Reggio at 9:03. Then Messinella, we get off at Ditraino... At noon, we'll be home. At 1:00, lunch; at 3:00, afternoon nap; at 5:00, our official engagement party. - More than 50 people are coming. - I'm already having so much fun. "Italian tango..." Dora! Dora! Giacomo! - Dora! - Hello! - You know, you look great with dark hair! - I barely recognized you! - You have a moustache, now. See, he looks good with it! Allow me. This is my fiance', and this is Mr. Doselli. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - We're getting married in a month. - Will you be here for long? No, we're leaving immediately. And you, you're not in seminary anymore, huh? No, I've decided to go into business, instead. After getting married, will you come and live in town for a bit? - No, he has his job... - Then, let me know your new address. So I can send you a box from my cured pork factory as a wedding gift! Oh, your business is pigs! How appropriate, ha ha! - Goodbye, Giacomo! - Bye, Dora. - Good day. - Good day. - Who's that? - He's the one who popped my cherry. Are you crazy, talking like that? And he wanted your address. Jerk! I'm a policeman. I'll denounce him! I'll have him arrested. He won't get away with it. Corruption of an underage girl! How old were you? - Is Mr. Meciotti here? - He's working in the darkroom. Come in. - Nino, there's a man for you! - I'm coming! - Are you his wife? - No, I'm a friend of his. Well, he can surely pick his friends well. - Are you a client of Mr. Meciotti? - No, but let's say he will be our client. Advertising, huh? Not bad. This is you, isn't it? - Does it make good money? - Yes, sure. - Good morning, I'm Meciotti, nice to meet you. - I'm Brega. Did I bother you? No, I was developing these photos, but I'm almost done. Please sit. You organized a contest "New Faces for New Films," right? Yes, a couple of years ago! Participatory fees were 10,000 lire, right? Right. For photos, registration expenses, and for showing the photos to... To a famous director of a famous production company, in front of a notary. Right? What do you think, could I be a "New Face"? Well, of course. It depends whether you're photogenic or not. - Could I...? - Sure, go ahead. - Let me see. You have an interesting profile. We should try with some photos. We'll take your photos, front and side! More than 30 "New Faces" pressed charges against you for fraud. Fraud? What fraud? Is it my fault if the director didn't choose them? Right, what does he have to do with it? It's the director's fault. You know who was the director? Him. And the famous production company? Him. And guess who was the notary. Him, again! Or am I wrong? Well, and you? Isn't it against the law to sneak in here? You could have said that you were a policeman! I shouldn't need to, people usually recognize us, right away. Well, not if you go around disguised, as you are! You know what you look like, with that face...? Don't get yourself in trouble, too. No, please, go ahead. So I can bring her in, too, for insulting a public officer. - Let's go. - You'll see, I'll be back soon. It's nothing serious. Wait here. - If I'm not back for dinner... hold on, I want to leave her something. - Okay. - Nino, where are they taking you? - I don't know. - I think... to the police station, right? - For now. Well, I'll come with you, so I can hear what they tell you. She's my associate, can she come along? Anybody can go into our station. - "You're so big, and you brought men with you?!" - "Shut up, Dora." - Who's there? A man with a goatee? - I don't know. You could have told him I wasn't here. - Dora! - Nino! - Dora, you came to see me! - Come on, come on, the rules. Yes. Dora, come here, sit down. I'm so happy to see you. - You look so good, Dora. - You, too. - Right. I look horrible. But here isn't so bad! Everybody loves me. Right, officer? Sit down. Outside, one has to run around all day. Phone calls, appointment, humiliations... Here, nobody says anything. You do whatever you want. If you want to say hello, you do. If not, you don't. We don't move much, but we don't get fat. And then, you meet people. You make friends that one day might become useful. For work. In my cell, there's a count and a lawyer. They're good people. The lawyer said that if he gets out before me, he'll help me out. Dora, I keep talking about myself. What about you, what have you been doing? - Well, first I tried to find a job... - And then? And then, I tried to manage. You said it yourself, "it's impossible to work with me." What? But I told you to sell the cameras, the lamps... Right. And then? I was back to square one. You're right. I left you in a bad situation. Can you do math? - Why? - There's a factory owner who was looking for a secretary, an accountant. I could write you a recommendation letter. Right! With a letterhead from prison! Right. I'm a real loser, huh. You know, every evening I wondered what you were doing. Well, now I know. What did you expect? That I waited for you with a bottle in my hand and lights ready for the shoot? I don't expect anything, on the contrary... I'm happy we've been together. I showed your picture to some friends here... Oh, right! Officer! If that picture doesn't come out, I'll report it and have all the cells searched. What was I saying? Right, they didn't believe that I knew you. I'll leave now, though. I'm serious, Nino, I'm sick of this. I want a quiet place, where people will leave me alone. There's a friend of my mother who's known me as a child. I'll go stay with her. In Northern Italy, people mind their own business. I wouldn't bet on that. North, South... And where does this friend live? - In Parma. - Parma?! Where culatello salami is made! At least, you'll eat well. There are tortellini, lasagna, agnolotti meat... parmesan cheese, boiled meats... Lambrusco wine... pig legs... Damn it... Officer, you and your soups! Can I be transferred to a jail in Bologna? "Parma, Parma station." "Arrest him, don't be silly." If you were to arrest everyone who wants to sleep with me, you'd have to arrest every man in town. Don't you think that guy wants to sleep with me? Dora, remember who you're with! I'm a public officer. Now that we're getting married, be careful. It's your duty! In bed you want me like this, but in public you want a lady, huh? No, my dear Michele Pantano'. You want to marry me! Look, I've tried so hard for a month, now. I really tried, but I can't do it. As soon as you open your mouth, I get irritated. I've had enough! It might be my fault, but I can't do this. Dora, what are you doing? Dora, come here. Wait! One moment! Where are you going Dora? Get off! Dora! Dora! Dora! Stop, driver, stop! - Excuse me, is Nino here? - Nino who? - Nino Meciotti. - He doesn't live here anymore. Do you know where I can find him? - Try at the shop. - Did he set up a shop? Here you go, thanks! Go pay at the cashier. Doctor, those are all gone. Get the eggplants, they're better. Look at this one, it's so big. Here! For you? Ah, the lasagna. Is the lasagna coming? - The stuffed peppers from Friday are all gone? - There are five left. Let's try to sell them to some young men. An old person might die. Here are the three suppli, grandma. I put in four. Iris, we need to order the containers. - Could you give me a suppli? - One moment, I'm serving the lady here. Dora, when did you come back? I'm so happy to see you. - I can tell. - How are things up North? And here, are things going well for you? What could I have done? When I got out of jail, I was alone. They put all my stuff on the street, I was broke. Should I have died of hunger? How many marinated lattarini fish? I remember you liked them. At least, with her I'm safe. No more problems. I don't love her, of course. It's just gratitude, as if she adopted me. - You finally found your million dollar idea. - I wish! - Are these fresh? - Priamo, help the gentleman here. I recommend the stuffed peppers. It's not fun being in here. It smells like fried food all the time. To the point that in the evening I only have coffee with milk. What should I have done? I didn't even have your address! Thank you. And now, where are you going? Are you staying in Rome, or what? I'll have some great idea, as you say. Thank you, Miss, come back soon. Miss, aren't you going to pay? I guess there was a mother in your future! Ha ha ha! - Who's that? - Who knows? I don't know her. Hello, Primavera Deli!
