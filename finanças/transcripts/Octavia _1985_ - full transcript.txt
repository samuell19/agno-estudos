OCTAVIA: Once there was a young blind girl named Octavia Hart. She was a witch. And when she was very young, her mother died. And her father went wild with grief, and turned into a horrid, hideous beast. Every morning, he would come to Octavia's bedroom door and say "Octavia, give me your heart!" But Octavia would never give her heart to her father. One night, she crept out into the garden took out her heart, and buried it in the cold, damp soil. And the heart called out, "Octavia, "if sleep too long in the cold ground, I'll freeze to death. "Please give me to someone." And Octavia said, "I'm sorry heart. "I don't know anyone who wants you." And the heart began to cry. And tears from the magic heart trickled down to the roots of the grass, and the grass lit up. And the tears reached the trees, and the trees began to shine. And terrified, Octavia called out, "Heart! Stop doing this!" And the heart stopped. But every night thereafter, late, deep into the night, after everyone else had gone to bed the garden would light up. And Octavia could hear her heart outside crying, waiting for the day when someone would come to love her. I could have had some... ...warmth in my life, some feeling. I could have had love. What do I have? You. You and your dolls. That's all I've got. This, this mausoleum. This is my whole life and it's not worth a damn. PARKER: I don't want you talking to Duke! Uncle Duke! You're not going to see him! Daddy, I never talk to anyone besides you... He's the only person I'm not afraid of. If he comes here, and you don't let me see him... You're not happy living here with me? Answer me! You're not happy with me? I didn't mean that. You don't like living here? Leave! No, Daddy...Go on, get out! Don't say that. I can't! Get out! Get out! I can't! I'm afraid to! [SOBBING] I've never been past the front gate. I've never been to school. I can't even read Braille. In the room with a radio... I'd be an idiot, Dad. Please let me stay. You want me to lock you up? You wouldn't do that. The hell I wouldn't!I hate you. That's my girl. I hate you! I hate the sound of you and I hate the way you smell. [SCREAMS] Well, why don't you die! Nice way to talk to your... [HORN HONKING] PARKER: Get up! OCTAVIA: No! Get up! No! Get up! [SOBBING] No! [OCTAVIA SCREAMING] Come on! I don't want to, no! Get in there! No! Get in there. No! No! [CRYING HYSTERICALLY] Daddy! Let me out of here! Parker! Dukey! How are you? And who's this? Isn't he the limit? I got him for Octavia in Montreal. Dukey.Hmm? Dukey, you've got to stop doing this. I'm up to my ass here in teddy bears. I can't help it! You know I had to buy a goddamn seat for him on the plane! Where's Octavia? How long can you stay? I've gotta catch another plane out at 3:00. PARKER: What do you mean, another plane out at 3:00? You mean you're not going to spend the night? DUKE: I can't. OCTAVIA: Daddy, let me out of here! Daddy! It'll kill Octavia to know she missed you. Lord, I love that little girl. I'd steal her away from you in a minute if I could. Well, you can't. You're a good father, Parker. Ah, no. Oh, yes you are. Now I know about these things. Look, I gotta go. Don't stay away so long. Now, give the bear to Octavia and put some furniture in that goddamned house. I'll do that. Bye, Uncle Duke. No, ma'am! That won't work! You don't get out that easy. [COUGHING] OCTAVIA: Uncle Duke! Uncle Duke! You want Uncle Duke? Uncle Duke! You want Uncle Duke? Go get him! Uncle Duke, where are you? Go get him. Uncle Duke? You want Duke?Yes! Uncle Duke! You want Duke? Go then, go on. Uncle Duke! Uncle Duke, oh, wait for me! You want him, go get him. Uncle Duke? [CRYING] No. You want Uncle Duke?Yes. Daddy, no! Go on, come on. Daddy, no, I don't want to go out here! Daddy, no! I don't want to be out here! Daddy, where are you? Daddy, say something! I don't know where I am! Daddy, don't do this to me! Daddy! I wouldn't do this to you! [HORN HONKS] [SCREAMS] [PARKER LAUGHING] Where's Uncle Duke?He's gone. He left you. Yes. You're not so brave anymore, are you? No, I'm not very brave now. Still want Uncle Duke? No. Who do you love?You...you. Get up to the house. [POLICE SIREN WAILING] [PANTING] [GIGGLING] [DOOR SLAMS] Daddy? Hi, Daddy. Made you dinner.Quiet. I made you a roast. Shut up. Daddy, I've got to talk to you. Make it fast. I'm starting to hear things.What? Everything smells like metal. And... ...when I, when I try to go to sleep, my bed starts moving. [LAUGHING] That's, uh... Daddy, it's not funny! I feel like I swallowed a snake, and I can't tell where my skin is anymore. I feel like I'm turning into a cloud! I don't know what to do. I try not to think about it. I just do my work and don't feel, but the more I do that the worse it gets. What's all this talk about? What do you want me to do? I want you to say you love me. Go to bed.I can't! My bed is moving all over my room. I feel like an idiot! You're my father. Just once can't you tell me you love me out loud? Where did you get this dress? From the attic. It's one of mother's. Never wear that dress again. Daddy! I'm dead. Oh Lord who watches over all things, watch me tonight. You who see everything, protect me from my dreams that I may not go crazy and live in them forever. Don't let my spine shrivel up. Keep my soul inside my body while I sleep so that it doesn't slip out of my mouth and fly away. Please, God, bless me and bless my father. Who's there? Please, I'm blind. Don't hurt me. Who are you? I've been watching you. [SCREAMS] Daddy! Goddamn it, let go of me! I'm sorry. Where's my dinner? It's not ready. Why not? I couldn't! Why not? I don't know. Jesus Christ. Daddy! Don't leave me! Daddy! No! No! [GASPS] Go away! Somebody help me! [CLOCK TOLLING] Goodbye, bear. I know you're there. Whatever you're going to do to me, do it to me now. Otherwise, I'm going to die of fright. Oh, please don't torture me. I'm so afraid of pain. [MUFFLED GASP] [GIGGLING] Hello? Hello? [BIRDS TWITTERING] Hello? Where are you? [WHISTLES] Who are you? You don't want to know. Did you sleep out here all night? I tried to. Were you cold? What do you think? I'm sorry. I, uh... ...didn't sleep much myself. You see, I've... ...never touched a man before, much less kissed one. Not even my father. He won't let me, and, oh, I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. Do you want to come inside?No. Oh. Is there something I can do for you? I'm all right. You have to excuse me, I'm not much of a hostess. I've never had company before. Your skin feels different than mine. And you smell like... Like I imagine a horse would smell. Oh, I hope that's not rude. Can I touch your face again? [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Oh, that is rude. Can I? If you're nodding or shaking your head, you may as well save your neck because I can't see. Yeah, come on. [GASPS] I'm sorry. Give me your hand. Come on. What is that? Is that your beard? Oh, dear God... [LAUGHS] What color's your hair? Brown. Brown. Oh, good. I don't know what that means. Brown, huh? Your lips are so rough. You lips feel like the bottoms of my feet! How do you eat? You do smell like a horse! I mean you smell like a saddle. I got a whiff of one of those one time. I mean, a saddle must smell like a horse, right? Oh, my... What's your name? Bo. Bo? Bo what? Bo! How about that. Bobo, what are you doing here? Are you a gypsy or a Martian or what? I'm on the lam. You're on a lam? What does that mean? I'm running away. From what? Hey, what's your name? Octavia Hart. Octavia, hide me. Just put me up for a couple of days. Oh, I'd like to... No...I don't know. You see, I'm a terrible chicken and you...you're a lion. I've got to admit, I like this. I don't know. I just need time. I can tell you right now the problem is going to be my father. You have to promise me to be very quiet and do exactly as I tell you, because if he catches you, he'll eat you like a grape. You don't worry about your father. All I ever do is worry about my father. [MOANING] OCTAVIA: Daddy? I think I'll go out for some air. It's good out tonight. Octavia... Yes, Daddy? I don't care where you go or what you do. Goodnight, Daddy. [WHISTLES SOFTLY] This is very silly. [WHISTLES] Not only do I have a man in my garden, but he comes when I whistle! Things are looking up! You've got to have a place to sleep tonight. Follow me. Come on, Bobo. My name's not Bobo. Yes, it is, come on! Here, I got you a candle. Do you like it? All this was my grandfather's. He built it. This little house was his private museum. He was an archeologist. There used to be mummies, and dinosaurs, totem poles. It smelled wonderful. Now a family of trolls lives here. But I sent out word that you were coming, so I'm sure they won't mind. Oh, one thing you may not know about me is that I'm a witch. Is this bed for us? No, my bed's inside. Fine. Okay, let's talk. I don't suppose you've ever been in prison. No. I've contemplated murder, though. That's a start. See everybody has a little murder in their hearts someplace. Is that true?Yeah. Most people don't have the balls to pull it off. Balls? Yeah, you know, guts. Oh. I don't have any balls. You do, though. Oh, you're an angry person. I can smell anger. It smells like sulfur. Fear smells like lemons. Yeah, you think you can smell that, huh? Oh, yeah. Did you kill someone? No. Is that why you were in jail? Look, drop it, huh? I just want to know. You don't know. Oh, no, don't go! I'm sorry. I'll talk about something else. Look, just don't ask me any questions, huh? Yes. Zero I promise. 'Cause I've never been anywhere and I've never done nothing. You got it? Yes, sir. God, you're beautiful. Am I? You know you are. How would I know that? Bo, how am I pretty? What do I look like? You look like a wet dream. That's interesting. Is that good? Bo! Am I pretty? Yeah, you're pretty. PARKER: Octavia! Uh, I gotta go. Eat the food and go to sleep. You'll be warm tonight. I love you. PARKER: Octavia! PARKER: Octavia! Octavia! [EXCLAIMS] I'm pretty! Is that true? Come on, glass, spit it out! Oh! I'm in love! Now I'm really blind! Hello, in there! What do I look like? [DOOR OPENS] Morning. I brought you some breakfast. [SNIFFS] I decided something last night. I'm going to take care of you. I don't need anybody to take care of me. Does he hit you a lot? Oh, did you see? I was afraid of that. Doesn't matter. You know, you need to get away from here. Afraid to. What do you want from me? More salt. Oh, I'm sorry I'll do anything you want. Then just shut up. Bobo, what's wrong? "Bobo, what's wrong? Bobo, what's wrong?" What's wrong you talk too much, that's what's wrong. I'm trying to make you happy. You want to make me happy? Yes! Then suck my dong! Okay, what's a dong? It's a dick. What's a dick? You know what a dick is. No, I don't. Well, if you don't, you don't shut your mouth you're gonna find out. Bo, what is wrong? Last night, you were so nice, and... It's me isn't it? If somebody would just tell me what's wrong with me, I'll change it. You got no backbone. I know, I'm a chicken. I'm a coward. What do I do about it? You get out of this fuckin' house! I can't, I'm afraid to! [GASPS] You must have been in jail a long time. Don't get too smart now, okay? [BO SIGHS] Come here, come here. Talk to me. Tell me, what's the deal with you? What are you talking about? Money. What does your old man do? Do? He's a diamond broker. Where's your mother? She died when I was five. Of what? Of me, to hear my father tell it. How blind are you? I can see lights and shapes. You know, because, you don't seem very blind. I know I mean, why don't you use a cane or something? I've been living here for 20 years. What do I need a cane for? You know, my grandfather once bought me a cane, but I wanted a dog. Dog bit my father. [LAUGHS] Do you ever wear shoes? Never. Because you know, you really could, uh, wash your feet maybe. Who makes your clothes? Oh! I do! Out of my mother's old clothes and my grandmother's. Do you like them? No. Why don't you just... ...leave? Huh? No balls. Could you get your hands on some money? Oh, I can get money. But I'm blind, so I can never tell how much it is. I can do that. Get me some.Why? Now you do what I tell you to do and you don't ask questions. One minute you're telling me don't have any backbone and the next minute you're telling me to shut up and not ask questions. Don't... Don't play fuckin' head games with me. Now just do what I tell you and shut up, you got it? Yes sir. Okay. What time's your old man get home? Good Lord, you're a tiger! Oh, he's coming home today for lunch! I gotta go now and get it ready. I'll come back this afternoon. [GIGGLES] OCTAVIA: Daddy, I've decided there really is life on other planets. There's life on Pluto. It's very cold on Pluto. That's okay. Pluto people can deal with the cold. They're a cross between Eskimos and trolls. They have these huge ears, see. and that's a problem, 'cause you know how your ears go numb when it gets cold. And they have little pink noses, like rabbits that twitch, and no eyes at all. What could there be to look at on Pluto? It looks like a golf ball. But they have these huge ears and being that Pluto is right on the edge of the solar system, they can hear everything that's happening out in the galaxies. They can listen to the comets. Comets are great gossips. Because... 'Cause they're like traveling salesmen. They know all the dirt on the stars. And every night, the people of Pluto listen to the black holes singing. Black holes sound like... ...like old black men, up from New Orleans with deep, foghorn voices. And every night out between the galaxies, angels ride night coaches back to heaven after a hard day's work. Train's always late. Angels don't care. They just sit, looking out the window with their feet propped up, wings folded back and they listen to the hiss left over from the big bang. It calms their nerves and reminds them how young they are. And the people of Pluto hear it all. There are advantages to being blind and living on the fringes of the solar system, no matter how cold it is. [DOOR CLOSES] Have a good day, Daddy. Bobo? [WHISTLES] Here's the money. How much is it? Come on, you know how... You don't know how much it is. No. Is there anymore of this? Yes. A lot? Well, if that's a lot there's a lot more. [LAUGHS] Don't worry about getting your girdle. We're leaving! Oh, was afraid of this! Come on, get goin'! No! Move! Wait!Now! You're making this so hard and it could be so easy. You could live here just like Rumpelstiltskin and I could take care of you. Yeah, just try it. I don't have to try, it comes naturally . I smell lemons. Come on, fuck you. Let's go. I'm just dying to be loved and you're so afraid of it. Where are you going? Nowhere! Why are you afraid of me? Will you shut up! Just shut up. Oh, I had a feeling there was a limit to how long could keep you in my back yard. [GIGGLES] [GROWLS PLAYFULLY] Shh! [GIGGLING] Stop laughing! [GROWLS PLAYFULLY] Shh! PARKER: So! You're a little whore too! Daddy! You get out! You get out of my house! BO: You fuckin' ass wipe! I've known mean little bastards like you all my life! You wanna get fuckin' tough with me? You're a tough son-of-a-bitch with a blind girl! Try it with me! Come on, ass wipe! Come on, you push her around, come on, push me! Push me, huh? You're not so fuckin' tough now, are you, asshole? [SCREAMS] Come on! No, I can't!Move! I'm afraid! Bo, wait.What! Do you really want me? Yeah! Are you sure? No! [OCTAVIA PANTING] Oh, I feel like I'm going to hell. If I go out there, something horrible is going to happen to me, I know it. But if I stay here, something worse will happen. I'll lose you. Come on. [HORSE NEIGHING] Whoa! Whoa! Go, go! Come on, come on! That's it [SCREAMS]This way. Come on, come on, that's it. Okay, this way. Come on. Go, go! Come on. Come on, come on! That a girl! [MARSHALS HORSE] Well, this is it. This is it? [LAUGHS] I love it! Where are we? Whoa!Well, let's call it home. BO: Come here! What? Give me your hand. Ahhh! Where are we going? Bo! Bo! Trust me! Trust me! Oh! Oh! [OCTAVIA EXCLAIMING] This isn't a swimming pool, is it? Can I swim here? Oh! What if a fish bites me? Oh! Don't do that! You'll drown me! Stop it! Listen, I gotta tell you about the wilderness. You can't talk too much. It drives the animals crazy. Oh, is it true? Oh, God, I'm sorry. What are you doing? Somebody will see! There's nobody for 20 miles. Is that true? Mmm-hmm. What are these? What are they?It's clothes my grandmother used to wear. Are they? Uh-huh. No, you bought these at the store. [SQUEALING] Come on. Now sit down. Here you go. What are these? Dungarees. Dungarees! [EXCLAIMS] And what are these?What? Oh, they're shoes! Okay. No! No, I don't want shoes! Shut up! You'll cut your feet. You wear shoes. What kind of shoes are these? These are basketball shoes. They're basketball shoes? Basketball shoes. [OCTAVIA LAUGHING EXCITEDLY] [OCTAVIA WHOOPS] No, I want to go. Let go, let go! Wait, this is so... This is great. [EXCLAIMS] [LAUGHING] I love it! [SCREAMING] Come on, come on. Hey, come on, be good. I don't want a cigarette. It's not a cigarette. Dope!Yeah. [COUGHING] You're very hard to predict. I know what this is. 'Cause I heard about it on the radio. [COUGHING] Bo. What? Hey, what's the matter?I can see! [GIGGLING] Well, sure... [SQUEALS]Octavia! No, no, no, this is fun. Please, Bo. Do it again! [GIGGLING] Oh, no, don't! [BO BELLOWING] Hey, hey, don't cover my eyes! Come on! Why? Cut it out! Why? I can't see! What difference does it make? Neither can I. [OCTAVIA EXCLAIMING] Do it again! That's all. What? All done. Oh, all right. Tavie, come back! No! There's a cliff! Bears! Zulus! Tavie, get down from there. [IMITATING MONKEY CRIES] I'm not lookin'. Bo, look! I can do it! I can do it! Come here, you. This isn't funny. You're not a monkey. Yes! And I'm not a monkey. You're not a monkey. [OCTAVIA SCREECHING] [GRUNTING] Now, sit down, and don't move, because you're driving me nuts. Stay! Okay, fine, go ahead. Break your neck. I don't care! Ow! [FROG CROAKING] [SCREAMS] Bo! Bo, where are you? Bo! Bo! Bo, where are you? Bo! Bo! Tavie... Be careful, huh? What is this?I spent all day putting it up. It's a tent. It's a tent? See? Yeah. You mean we're going to live here? Yeah. Be careful. What's it made of? Be careful! Be careful!All right! It feels like my tennis shoes! Are we going to live here? Yeah I love it! Easy, easy! Easy! Can I go inside? Easy, easy! Tavie! Where's the bathroom? Tavie! You know, for a rich girl you're pretty stupid. [LAUGHING] No! Bo! Tavie! What? Come here. No. Come here! No! Come back to bed! No. You come here. Why?Come here! No!

What? Give me your hand. [GASPS] What is that? It's a rabbit. It's a bunny? Is it alive? Yeah, yeah. He's alive. He was alive! There... Oh... I've never touched a live bunny before! As a matter of fact, you're the only living thing I've ever touched. You and that snake of yours. Oh! [LAUGHS] Bo, do you love me? No. Why were you in jail? You don't want to know. Yes, I do. Tell me, why'd you go to jail? Parking tickets. No, that's not true. Come on. Why'd you go to jail? I shot the Pope, okay? No. I killed Kennedy. Why'd I go to prison? I don't know! I don't know! I don't know. You see my whole life's been a crime. Mine, too. Do you think you'll ever love me? Do I take care of you? Yes. Do I make love to you? Yes. Do I hit you? No. Then what do you want? I want you to say you love me out loud. No! I don't! You know, you're a fucking pussy! I don't know what that means. It means that you're not very brave. Well, I'll tell you a secret, Bo. Until someone, sometime, somewhere says they love you, you can't be very brave. Shut up! Just shut up and eat your food. OCTAVIA: And Octavia called to the magic heart "Heart, "I've made a terrible mistake. "I've given you to someone who doesn't love me. "Heart, please come home." And the heart called back to Octavia. "Octavia, you gave me away. "You can't tell me what to do anymore." [GIGGLING] Oh! Wait a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I keep expecting it to blow up in my face. What? All of it. I keep thinking, like, like I've done something wrong. But I haven't. And I keep expecting to be punished, but I won't be. I'm happy and I'm in love. Wow. [BIKERS LAUGHING] You like that, boy?

[INDISTINCT CHATTERING OVER RADIO] MAN: [OVER RADIO] Affirmative. WOMAN: We live in this big old house, and it's all covered with big red bricks. You warm enough? And when you walk in the front door it smells like lemon polish, peppermint sticks, and tobacco. Jim smokes a pipe. I know. And to the left is the living room. And there's the grandest piano you'll ever see. It sounds so terrible. [OCTAVIA GIGGLES]But Jim loves it [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] And we have this dog named Baxter, who matches the house. He has red, long hair and he shakes it all over. [LAUGHS] He is so silly. You'll see. We're going to have so much fun. Bo? Octavia, no! Wait a minute! Well, how is he? He's going to be all right. Oh, God, thank you! OCTAVIA: What are you doing? What are you doing? No! No! Are you crazy? He's half-dead! Well, he has to go to hospital! There's a hospital in the prison. Prison!
