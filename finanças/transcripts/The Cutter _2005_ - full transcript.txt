25.000 English from SDH + # HS, sync from 23.976 ? 17.12.2021 The Sinai Desert The Cutter (2005) Hey, you guys. This cave wasn't on the map stolen from the museum in Cairo. We're here three weeks, Rachel, and now you tell us this? What difference does it make? (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) English, Kareem. How do you know there are two maps? - Professor Abrams told me. - Well, now it makes sense. Right. Hey, you guys. I think I found something. That's it. That's it! Gentle. (KAREEM SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) David, further that way. No, no, please. Let's see how big it is. That's it. Be careful. Straight. Up to the side. Ready? Good. Go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nice work, gentlemen. (MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) No, no, no, please. Don't... With these, the future can be told. You bastard. No! Let me go. Please, help me! No. Let me go! No. Let me go! Hello? Follow my instructions on the DVD. If you deviate from any of the instructions, you'll never see your daughter alive again. No. Let me go! I want $2 million in 50s and 100s. No consecutive serial bills. No! No new bills. No marked bills. Do not involve the police or your daughter will die. Stop it! Mommy, I'm scared. You'll never see your daughter alive. I'm scared. You'll never see your daughter alive. # Son of a bitch! # Get behind him! # Kill the bastard! # - Where is she? # - Shit. You speak Russian? # Where is Ruth Mueller? I'm sorry I was too late. Did you have to throw him out of the window, Shep? I needed some air. Could have made a call before you pulled a Die Hard. Your phone was busy, Moore. Maybe you should spring for an extra line. Hey, you were a cop for 25 and change. You know the routine. The family hired me to find the girl, Parks, after they lost faith in you. Oh, yeah. And you found her, all right. Look, Shep, I know you've had a rough day and I know how you take it personal when things don't go the way you planned. So why don't you go home, have a couple of cool ones, get it behind you, okay? All right, partner. Hey, you know, Shepherd, we had these guys as suspects in two other kidnap for ransom cases. Does that surprise you? No. What surprises me, Parks, is that you didn't connect these guys to the girl's kidnapping. I did. Hey, you know... Where you going? I'm not finished with you yet, pal. You aren't, but I am. I got a family to notify. Last boarding call for Flight 137, service to Las Vegas. All ticketed passengers of Flight 137 to Las Vegas... # I've arrived. Please do not leave any unattended baggage in the airport terminal. All unattended baggage should be... I'm looking for a guy by the name of Zalman. Zalman. Doesn't ring a bell? Are you sure? Came here like in the mid '40s. He's a cutter. Shalom, Rabbi. Do you have a minute? Of course. How can I help you? I'm in town from New York for a couple of days and I'm trying to locate a great uncle. He immigrated to this area around 1947, '48. - He survived Auschwitz. - What's his surname? - Zalman, with a "Z." - Zalman. No. What kind of work did he do? Jewelry business. He was a cutter. The only cutter I know of that age is Isaac Teller. Isaac Teller. ? Not too bad ? Not too good ? Just medium ? Ho, ho, ho Okay. Hello? Isaac? Hello, Isaac. It's me. I'm in here. - Where are you? - I'm here. We're gonna be late for work. Have you taken your meds? Elizabeth, you're the best. But why do you have to... Just get dressed already. We're gonna be late. Why are you such a nudge? # It's Me. # I haven't found him yet. Did you wire the money? # You've already received two and a half million. # You'll get the second half when the Breastplate has been authenticated, # and the diamonds have been cut! # I'll call you soon as I find him. I've got three estates to look at this morning. I'm gonna need you to appraise a few stones for me. Isaac, are you paying attention? Hello? Uh-huh. Yeah, of course. Three estates. Elizabeth, tonight, after we close the shop, how about you and I go out for dinner, huh? My treat. Excuse me. Are you Mr. Schachter? And you are? Vladimir Yukov. What can I do for you, Mr. Yukov? I need to have some jewelry appraised. Antique diamonds, some rare colors. Mostly large, uncut stones. I'm told there's a cutter who is in his 80s, who's supposed to be the best. - That could only be Isaac Teller. - Isaac Teller? - Yeah, he's a close friend. - Do you know how I can reach him? He has a jewelry store across town with his niece, Elizabeth. You wouldn't have his address, would you? Sure. It's 137 West Broadway. Thank you, Mr. Schachter. Mmm, not at all. Where are we going? If you want to, let's walk. Let's go, then. If you want to go to the art museum, we'll go there. We'll have a nice time. What's going on? You've hardly said a word to me tonight. I've done some reflecting these last few days. More reflecting than usual? Elizabeth, years ago, before your parents passed away, I promised them I'd always take care of you. You're the last of our family. Don't start talking about dying. I asked... All right, shush, shush, dear. Elizabeth, you've really become a very good cutter. This is my legacy to you. It's a diagram of a cut I designed when I was in Auschwitz. It's called the Tolkowsky Modification. Once you perfect it, it will make you a great cutter. Ruth Mueller's rosary is tomorrow afternoon. Do you feel like going? Ay, for a child to die before a parent, a tragedy. I'm just not up to it. Please give the family my respects. The family hired me to find the girl, Parks. Find the girl, Parks. And you found her, all right. Found her, all right. I'm sorry I was too late. I'm sorry I was too late. Too late. The family won't accept the money, Shep. I really appreciate it, Monsignor, but I didn't earn it. But you found Ruth. You gave them a chance to bury her. Then start a scholarship in her name, but I can't take it. I understand. Good to see you again, Shep. Mrs. Mueller, I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Listen. Just pick up the niece and bring her to the warehouse. Yes? Good afternoon, sir. I'm Vladimir Yukov. Moshe Schachter has given me the name of Isaac Teller. Moshe Schachter. Yes. Come in, please. Oh, thank you. Mr. Schachter tells me you're a great cutter. I only do special jobs. Most of the cutting is done by my niece, Elizabeth. The eyes, the hands, they are not what they once were. You understand. But you are available to consult? Perhaps. I have two stones consigned to me for cutting. A white and a red. A man could live 10 lifetimes without ever setting eyes on stones like these. Sometimes I feel I have lived that long. Have you ever seen two stones each more than 500 karats in the rough? Never. This I would like to see. Where do you have them? Close by and very secure. Help! It's our lucky day. Good job, bud. He's gone. Go! Go! Ugh! Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill you! Hey, lady, wait. Police! Lose the .45, pal. Relax. I'm the good guy. Move away from the stiff. Do it slow. You on the ground, don't move! Down! Don't move! Now he was the bad guy. Headquarters tells us that our man is a freelancer, speaks foreign languages fluently, and has used 13 different names that we know of. As you can see by these photographs here, he's also a master of disguises. According to Interpol, our suspect murdered a team of five archeologists at an excavation site here in the Sinai Desert. For this. The Breastplate of Aaron. The Breastplate of Aaron is one of Israel's most sacred religious artifacts and it may now be here in Spokane. If we find our man, we may just find this artifact. Now I don't have to tell you, he's armed and dangerous, so watch your backs. Mr. Teller, please. Oh. May I? Certainly. Oh, these are the most magnificent stones I've ever seen. So, Mr. Teller, are you available to consult? You have to ask? What, uh, design do you have in mind? I want them cut into matching brilliants. Five have been considered. The King variation, the briolette. The trilliant, the navette variation. What is the fifth cut? Eighty-five facets, first designed by Marcel Tolkowsky as a variation of his original brilliant. And then in Auschwitz, you changed it, perfected it. The Tolkowsky Modification. Who are you? # You just came out of retirement, Cutter! Isaac? Isaac, you here? This is my legacy to you. No! As I told your buddies behind the mirror, I don't know the girl. Let me get this straight. You see a girl get snatched, you chase the car, you take out two thugs, and that's your story, Shepherd? Well, not exactly, Parks. What do you mean? Well, I took out one thug and your buddies took out one thug. Oh, boy. You just think you're real funny, don't you? About as funny as your questions are stupid. All right, both of you, knock it off. Hi, you guys. Hey, wait. What the hell you doing in here? Hey, do you mind if I take my client to breakfast, 'cause I'm sure you haven't fed him yet. Counselor, who the hell called you? Heard on my police scanner. Nice suit, Moore. Makes you look taller. Say, where do you keep the batteries for that shirt, Eddie? You're a scream. I'm finally taking a vacation. Where you going? Paradise, baby. Where they bury pigs in a volcano. Now, Shep, think you can do me a favor? Stay out of trouble, stop killing people, just till I get back. I'll give it a shot. You know, the press is gonna be staking your place out again after this one. Yeah, you're right. No parties. - Hey, Shep. - Hey, Alena. Oh, um, Eddie told me about a no-name woman calling him about me being sweated in major crimes. Any idea who that would be? This, uh, this no-name female, what did she sound like, Counselor? Gypsy. Yup. Gypsy-Ukrainian, if I had to guess. Gypsy-Ukrainian. Hmm. Can't imagine who that would be. Excuse me. Don't be strangers, boys. If I could fight, I would smack you. You should have married her. Been there, done that, Eddie. Now am I gonna have a problem with my PI license over this? Shep, come on. I'll take care of it before I leave. You're a good buddy and a good lawyer. I know. I'm the best. Ah, I wouldn't go that far. Miss Teller? I'm Lieutenant Moore with the Spokane PD. This is Special Agent Parks with the FBI. Where were you last night? Can never find a cop when you need one. About last night, you left the scene of a double homicide and then waited 12 hours before coming in to report your uncle Isaac missing. Why the delay? I left because I had no idea who was shooting at whom or why. So why wait 12 hours? I was hoping my uncle might come home. So, what about my diamonds? Well, we don't mean to be presumptuous. Oh, go ahead, be presumptuous. Some investigators might suspect that you set this whole thing up and it went down all wrong. What about the guy in the van? Did you question him? You mean John Shepherd, the man that saved your life. And the answer is, yes, we did. Okay, then. Excuse me. Miss Teller, three years ago, you stabbed a man that tried to rob your uncle. And tried to rape me, and you saw the verdict. Justifiable homicide. Are you suggesting that I set up the robbery, too? Look, I'm not missing. My uncle is missing, so, if you'll excuse me, I have to plan another crime. She's dirty. Why aren't you working, cutter? Listen to me, whoever you are, I'm not going to do this anymore. You want to play? We'll play. Look, I survived four years in Auschwitz. You cannot threaten me. Elizabeth. What have you done with Elizabeth? Cut the stones, old man, or I'll bring Elizabeth to you one piece at a time. This is my legacy to you. It's a diagram of a cut I designed when I was in Auschwitz. It's called the Tolkowsky Modification. It will make you a great cutter. (SPEERMAN SPEAKING GERMAN) (SPEERMAN SPEAKING GERMAN) # The fool demands to see his niece before he cuts the stones. # Two of your contractors are dead and I hear the FBI has taken an interest. # Has the authentication been made? # This week. There can be no more complications. # Do what it takes, but get those diamonds cut! Come in. Door's open. - I want my diamonds, Mr. Shepherd. - What diamonds? The ones you stole in the park. - Stole? From who? - From me. - Okay, describe the diamonds. - They were rough, uncut. I didn't get around to counting them. Let me get this straight. You're looking for diamonds that you can't describe and you don't know how many of them there are, and you want me to believe they're yours. Oh, you better believe they're mine, and you better give them to me now. Okay, okay. I won't kid anymore. Here. And by the way, there's 13 of them, if you want to count them. Thanks. You're welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you, Miss, um... Liz Teller. And, yes, there is. I've been told you're the best. It's about a missing person. - Who's missing? - My uncle, Isaac Teller. - How long has he been gone? - Since last night. Wait. Last night? How do you know he's really missing? Maybe he's with his girlfriend having a wild... He's over 80 years old, and he doesn't have a girlfriend. I've checked with his friends. No one's seen him. Look, Miss Teller, when most people hire me to find someone, it's because the cops have struck out, and I'm their last resort. I just want you to find him. How much? Well, if I don't find him, nothing. But if I do find him... $20,000 cash. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Excuse me? Oh, it's an expression in the diamond business meaning luck and blessing when you make a deal on a handshake. Okay, deal. Well, who was the last to see him? - I know he had a visitor. - How do you know that? Because there were two glasses on his living room table. - Did you touch these? - No. Well, maybe you're in the wrong business. What's that all about? - What's the problem? - I'm sorry to bother you today, sir, but I think you might have a problem with your fuse box. - Okay, follow me. - Thank you. Am I the only one? No, actually, the whole building's down. I've been working on the stinking basement for the last two hours. Ma'am. There it is. All righty. Right to it. Shepherd! Come on! Come on! This table wasn't broken when I was here. Well, I'm sure your uncle didn't do that. So someone came back here for the tea glass with his print on it. And it looks like he got a little bit upset when he didn't find it. Well, I have to assume your uncle was kidnapped. Forget the assumption. He was kidnapped. Who would do such a thing to such a sweet man? - This your uncle? - Yes. - Can I borrow it? - Mmm-hmm. Why him? What's his background? He was born in Poland, but he didn't get out before the Nazis. Besides my parents, who brought him here after the war, no one else in the family survived the Holocaust. How'd you get into the jewelry business? Family. Five generations. Who trained you? After my parents passed away, Isaac sent me to Antwerp to train with the masters. And so now I do all the cutting, and he does the important appraisals. - Would you like some tea? - Yeah, sure. Why no ransom demand? You tell me. Shepherd? Shepherd! Don't say a word. He'll be all right. Shepherd. Cut the stones, old man, or I'll bring Elizabeth to you one piece at a time. One piece at a time. One piece at a time. One piece at a time. Whoa, what a place. Who lives here? My lawyer, Eddie. How'd you guys meet? Oh, we met on a serial murder investigation. Eddie had a female client that went missing, and I was the lead investigator on the case. I finally found the girl, well, what was left of her. And soon after that, I retired from the force. And then you became a PI? Yeah. Liz, don't answer the phone unless you hear my voice. Well, well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're not leaving me here. Look, I'll only be gone for a little while, okay? And don't open the door unless you know it's me. Okay, now, that is Isaac Teller's fingerprint. What about the other print? See, that's where it gets interesting. He's a chameleon, a man of many faces. Uh, that is not good. Usually means there's a red flag in the system. Are you sure about where you got this fingerprint? Have I ever lied to you, Moore? Not in the last 24 hours. I think the last person who spoke to Isaac was Moshe Schachter. Who's he? He's a jeweler, a friend of Isaac's. Sometimes they go in together on a stone, shop it around, and split the profits. Well, let's go see him. Mr. Schachter? Mr. Schachter? It's Liz Teller. Hello? Is he... Yeah. That's the guy from Isaac's basement. Shepherd! Hebrew. What? So what were you doin' here? I think Schachter was the last one to see Isaac Teller. I wanted to ask him a few questions. Did you know the guy that got his throat slashed from ear to ear? No, you? We're runnin' him. Speaking of which, you are running out of lives, Shep. Yeah, but who's counting? Man, you look like a road map. His rental car contract comes back Anthony Maylam of Brussels. His prints, however, come back as someone else. Look, people, sitting in this room, we've got about half the alphabet agencies. So let me ask this question a different way. Who the heck is this Anthony Maylam? Let's take it outside. Yeah? I know a little bit about this guy, but not much. You kept this from me? I mean, what the hell? We're partners on a joint task force. Partners? Partners my ass. This is my show, my task force. You work for me, understand? Who is he, Parks? And what's he doing in Spokane? - He's tracking the breastplate. - For? - Interpol. - Interpol doesn't work in the States. That's what DC's trying to figure out. Well, is there anybody else working under the radar? Not that I'm aware of. Something tells me this isn't just about the breastplate or somebody who likes to change his face and kill people, or am I wrong, Agent Parks? Be careful. The guy at Moshe Schachter's, he told you something before he died. Yeah, but it didn't make sense. What did he say? Well, first he said, "Hebrew" and then something like, "Ocean mesh pot." Ocean mesh pot? The words are Hoshen mishpat from the ancient Hebrew. The literal translation into English is "Breastplate of Judgment." Oh, from the Old Testament, book of Exodus. That's right. I'm very impressed. You know what? I got an idea. If you hold on a second, I have something very interesting for you to look at. Just hold on a second. Got just what I was looking for. Now, it was worn first by the High Priest Aaron, older brother of Moses. So it came to be known as Aaron's breastplate. After the death of Aaron, the breastplate was passed down through the tribe of priests, the tribe of Levi. Okay, here it is. Now, if you can see, each of the stones in the breastplate represented one of the tribes of Israel. The priest was to keep their interest in his heart when making decisions on their behalf. What do you think, Dr. Joseph? Dr. Joseph? What do you think? Yeah. Yeah, it's... First, the stones, they're typical of the time. It's that... The lapis lazuli, the topaz. The turquoise is... The Phoenician engravings, Dr. Joseph. Hmm? The Phoenician engraving. The Phoenician engraving, yeah. They're... They're consistent with, uh, the script in the region at the time. And the weave and color? Definitely pre-Mosaic Egyptian. It's exactly as described in Exodus, Chapter 28. It's my, uh, preliminary judgment and it might be careless, but, uh, Heschel, this breastplate is authentic. What are those two stones in the high priest's hands, Professor? Uh, Urim and the Thummim. Now I'm impressed. And the words translate into English as light and perfection. Now, the stones, the Urim and Thummim, were kept in the pouch behind the breastplate. Did they have a purpose? On important matters, the high priest would remove the stones and ask a question of God. He would then roll the stones like dice. One stone symbolized yes and the other no. Now from the way the stones came to rest or the way they cast their light, the priest was able to determine God's answers to his questions. So that's how God spoke to them. These were ancient peoples, superstitious. They believed they had a covenant with God. Now, if it proves to be Aaron's breastplate, it was stolen from the excavation at Sinai Desert, right? Yeah. Forgive me, but I must ask... How the breastplate came into my possession, Dr. Joseph, will come out in due time. But you will have the honor of returning it to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Oh, thank you so much. This is... This is unbelievable. We can go now. Morning, Jim. Alena, you got a minute? Yeah, sure. Your, uh, friend Shepherd is ruining our investigation. Yeah, well, he does that sometimes. Yeah, well, if he keeps doing that, he's gonna find himself in a world of hurt. I'm pretty sure Shep can take care of himself. I'm not too concerned with Shepherd. I'm more concerned with the people that he gets close to. There aren't that many. But if he's such a big problem for you, why don't you just pick up the phone and call him? How long you been on the task force? Nine months. Where is this going? You like it here? You want to keep working here? Maybe move up? Or you want to go back to sex crimes and dope at the end of your year? You know, I, uh, I don't like being threatened. Hey, I'm not threatening you. Just be smart, Alena. Have a heart-to-heart with your boy. Or? He's a shit magnet. Fill in the blanks. Yeah, there are problems with both stones. Are you stalling again, cutter? There's a fracture in a non-cleavage direction in the white, and a cloud where the star facet should be cut. So what are you saying? What I'm saying is that the faceting machine has a broken tooth gear. Look, if you want the stones cut, you're going to have to get me a new head mechanism. You better be sure about this. Okay, okay, Alena. I'll see you at 7:00 in the morning. What happened? It slipped. Did you cut yourself? It's Isaac. I'm so worried. We'll find him. I promise. Hey, how's it going? Could be worse, Shep. What's your excuse? Fresh out of 'em. Say, I want to thank you for calling Eddie for me. Hey, what are friends for? Uh, just coffee. We are friends, aren't we? Look, Alena, you know I've been through two marriages already, the last one just two years ago. Don't worry. I didn't call you down here to make you talk about our past. Then why did you call me down here? Parks is really bent out of shape about the way you've been treating him. Is that a fact? That's a fact. And if you don't back off, he's gonna make your life miserable. Oh, really? Did he say how he's gonna make my life more miserable than it already is? Don't take this lightly. Do you know that he used to be liaison for Counterintelligence at Interpol? So? As a favor to me, Shep, would you back off? As a favor to you, I will. Now I'll tell you what I really called you down here for. I overheard Parks talking to this guy, and I heard the name Colonel Speerman. Now, they think that this Isaac Teller, maybe he's more than just a kidnap victim. Hmm. Anything else? I'm pretty sure I overheard the word Holocaust. Holocaust? Yeah. Holocaust. Rabbi, is there anyone in your congregation who survived the concentration camps? Several. What are you looking for? Work details. I think I know someone who might be able to help you. I'll call her for you. Her name is Mrs. Rosen. Uh, one other thing. Has there been any strangers by here in the last few days asking you questions? Yeah. As a matter of fact, a young man came by just yesterday looking for his great uncle. Did he mention his name? He said the uncle's name was Zalman. Zalman, with a "Z." I'd never heard that name, so he thanked me and left. He said the uncle's name was Zalman. Zalman, with a "Z." Zalman, with a "Z." Come on, let's go. Where have you been? Tracking down leads. Where are we going? Another lead. Mrs. Rosen, can you tell us about the diamond cutters at Auschwitz? Yes, there were several master cutters while I was there. They... They used to cut diamonds in the camp for Adolf Hitler. Did you know any of the cutters? Well, they were segregated from the main population and very heavily guarded. Do you recognize this man? - It's my uncle, Isaac Teller. - That's Chaim Zalman. No, no, no. It's Isaac Teller. No, my dear, that's Chaim Zalman, one of the cutters. Oh. He had a beautiful wife, Rebecca, two young boys and a daughter. The SS forced the men to decide, either cut diamonds or die with their families in the gas chamber. The men cut diamonds. The wives became whores of the SS, so that their children could live. And then, one day, Rebecca and the children were taken to the center of the camp. And with Chaim watching, an SS soldier, on orders from Colonel Speerman, murdered Chaim's family, there, in cold blood. I never saw or heard of Chaim Zalman again. Please, excuse me. Why didn't he tell me about this? Your uncle probably wanted to start a new life after Auschwitz. I can't even imagine what he went through over there. The Tolkowsky Modification. What? It's a unique cut for large diamonds. What would your uncle need to cut these stones? Very sophisticated and expensive equipment. Let's start checking out the stores. Drop Heschel at the Davenport. Tell him I'll meet him there. Hello. May I help you? I need a head mechanism for a cutting machine. A head mechanism? Uh, let me check and see if we have any. Here you are. You're lucky. It's the last one we have. How much do I owe you? It's expensive. It's $3,400. How did you want to pay for that? Cash. All right, we'll take care of that. Don't you want a receipt? Where to, mister? The Davenport Hotel. Step on it. - You mean the Davenport on Broadway? - Just drive. You know, I've had people in my cab from all over the world. I'm pretty good with accents. I bet I can tell where you're from. Cat got your tongue? Just drive. This just came in from Bureau headquarters. This is Colonel Speerman. Appointed by Hitler to oversee the cutting of diamonds to help finance the war. The collection was known as the Reich Stones. And the most spectacular of all of them is this. 400-karat blue diamond known as the F?hrer's Stone, cut in a design called the Tolkowsky Modification. Where are these stones now? Well, uh, a few of them hit the diamond markets just after the war but they were cut into smaller stones. And the others are held by private collectors who may or may not know the histories. So if Isaac Teller was kidnapped to cut two large diamonds, then what? Well, he's cutting the diamonds for a man who has no intention of selling these in the legit market. It's either black market, or he's keeping them for himself. Either way, our man, whoever he is, is freelancing for that man right there. Col. Speerman. Speerman isn't walking around with that face anymore, is he? No way. # It was much easier in Auschwitz... to get him to work. # You had his wife, and three children. # I'm going to take my stones back to Austria uncut. # I can live with that. # Now, let's go see my old friend... # before you kill him. Hello. Excuse me, ma'am. Has anyone come in recently asking for these particular tools? As a matter of fact, there was a young man in here earlier who purchased a head mechanism, and paid cash for it. - Is that what he would need? - Yes. Did you see which way he went? He got into a Yellow Cab. That's all I saw. Okay, thank you. Mmm-hmm. Thanks. Here, you drive. I'm gonna call the Yellow Cab Company and find out who picked this guy up. There he is. Wait here. - Hiya, Calvin. - Hey. Do I know you? You picked up a fare in front of the Spokane Jewelry supply store, maybe two hours ago? Yeah, I remember that guy. I was just trying to be nice, and he was looking at me with some crazy eyes, like I owed him money or somethin'. Except, he didn't care about the money. Where did you take him? Now you know professional courtesy will not allow me to divulge that information. Well, I tell you what, Calvin. Why don't I take you down to police headquarters and you can divulge it there. - How about that? - You serious? Calvin, I'm as serious as a heart attack. - I took him to the Davenport Hotel. - Hmm. Davenport Hotel. Great, thanks a lot. Mmm-hmm. Do you know what the chances are of seeing this guy coming or going? We've been sitting here for hours. And he may not be even staying in the Davenport even if that's where the cabbie dropped him. Patience, Liz. - Hey, that's the guy from... - Yeah, our repairman. You're getting good at this. And who's the old man? My guess is someone from your uncle's past. Let's go. Moore, it's Shep. We're following the suspect east on Riverside in a silver Town Car. We're being followed. Stop here. Go to the warehouse. If they follow you, you know what to do. # - Where are you going? # - To have a little fun... - Go back to Eddie's and wait for me. - I'll follow the Town Car. - I said go back to Eddie's. - Okay, okay. Hi, this is John Shepherd. I'm not in. Just leave a message. Shep, I'm not at the apartment. I tailed the Town Car... Keep the change. Where's Isaac Teller? Or do I have to beat it out of you? Oh, that's what I like about you. That you're worried about Isaac when you should be worried about yourself. Should I take that as a threat? No. Your last will and testament. Drive. Shep, I'm not at the apartment. I tailed the Town Car... Shep, I'm not at the apartment... Lieutenant Moore, Spokane PD. Moore, Shep. Listen to this cell phone message and tape it. I'm on it, partner. Shep, I'm not at the apartment. I tailed the Town Car... Isolate and identify the horn. Enhance the voice. Get some air guard choppers and all available units into this area. Have them work the alleys for a silver Town Car and Shepherd's pickup truck. Okay, what about Liz's cell phone? If it's still working, we can do a GPS trace on it, right? Yes, we can. Get me the Air Guard. # It's pleasure to see you, old friend. You don't recognize me, cutter? Speerman? We both made it out. You changed your name, I changed mine. But we're still fellow refugees who survived the Holocaust. Amazing what some men will do to save themselves. Well, well, well. Finally one happy family. We now have the bargaining chip. Do you want him to cut the stones? Don't do it, Isaac. They're going to kill us anyway. What do you think, old friend? Never again. # I'll see you in Hell, Zalman! This is for my family! Die! # Help Me! # The past has caught up with you.. # ..and now it has killed you. Shep, I'm not at the apartment. I tailed the Town Car... Get away from her! Get away from her! Looks like she didn't like it. Help us. Please, help us. - Can't you just cut the wires? - No can do. It's a continuous circuit. If I try to disconnect it, well... Just don't move. - I have to get this bomb off of you. - Shep, behind you! Boyfriend's pretty tough. - What took you so long? - Careful. Forget about me. Free Elizabeth. Hurry, please, hurry. Go, Isaac. Let's go! Come on! Come on. # Shit! Did you have to blow up the building? - No hard feelings, huh? - All's well that ends well, Parks. Will you see that these get to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Shep? I sure will, Isaac. Along with the breastplate. How about a trip to Austria, partner? You've got to be kidding. Nope, I'm not kidding.
