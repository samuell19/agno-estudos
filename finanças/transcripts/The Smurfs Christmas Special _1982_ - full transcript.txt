I'm gonna play a solo in a holiday festival. Wanna hear it? Oh, I can't right now, Harmony, maybe later. 'I have to put my presents under the tree. Bye.' Hey, Grouchy, wanna hear my solo? I hate solos. Easy, smurf's it. Watch out! Be careful, Clumsy, slow down. Hefty, careful now. Sloppy! Hey, Smurfs, wanna hear my solo? Not now, Harmony, you should know better. Papa Smurf says the great pudding 'is one of the most important elements' 'of a holiday celebration.' 'And any distraction that might cause' 'even one drop to be spilled..' No Smurf appreciates good music anymore. [snoring] Wanna hear my solo, Lazy? [trumpet music] crash [snoring continues] ♪ La la la-la la la ♪ [Jokey chuckling] Smurfy-looking present you have there, Jokey. My special holiday surprises. One for every Smurf. 'Have you made yours?' I wrote a holiday solo. Wanna hear it? [trumpet music] Wait! boom That's not funny. I'll have to make another. I can hardly wait for it to be done. It's the greatest pudding I ever made. And I didn't spill a single drop. I know that Papa Smurf will be pleased with my work and I, for one, predict that.. plop You wanna hear my solo now? 'Move a little higher.' 'Easy with those cones.' 'A little lower, Smurfette.' 'That's right. Perfect.' [sighs] All my little Smurfs look so happy. This may be the best holiday celebration we've ever had. (male #1) 'And ever since then, on every Christmas Eve' Jolly Santa Claus with his white beard bright red cap and a big sack, stepped out on his journey to visit children all over the world. And bring us presents? Oh, I love that story, grandfather. Is Santa Claus real, grandfather? 'Well, when I was a little boy, William' 'Christmas Eve just wouldn't be Christmas Eve..' [dramatic music] Christmas Eve! Bah! Oh, I hate holidays. But Christmas, I despise most of all. Just think of those miserable blue Smurfs out there making their little presents, exuding all their...yuck! ...love and good cheer. I won't have it! I won't, I won't, I won't! [Azrael screeching] Ouch! Why, you miserable cat! I'm going to turn you into a rug that I can.. What's this? "Mother's Old Recipe for Making Life Miserable." This is it! This is just what I need to destroy the Smurfs' Christmas. Oh, how they'll suffer. And after they've suffered long enough 'I'll destroy them all, one by one.' [Gargamel laughing wickedly] ♪ Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride.. ♪ Unh-unh-unh. Not yet, Greedy. I was just making sure it was ready, Papa Smurf. Oh, no, you weren't, Greedy Smurf. You were sneaking a bite for yourself. And that's very selfish and unsmurfy because.. Brainy.. ...there are 99 other Smurfs besides yourself.. Brainy.. We all want equal shares of the great pudding because.. Brainy! Thank you. Now, as I was saying, Greedy.. '...the great pudding isn't complete' until we add the final ingredient. Uh, you mean the last walnut, Papa Smurf? That's right. The last walnut. You mean the big, plump, ripe delicious one that uh.. You ate! Sorry, Papa Smurf, I couldn't resist. That's alright, Greedy. I'll borrow another walnut from Squirrel. ♪ Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride.. ♪ [growling] crash (Gargamel) 'Now, Azrael, this wonderful recipe' 'isn't complete until we add the final ingredient.' Dearest mother's own sweet touch oil of rat wax. Oh, it does my heart good, Azrael. Soon the Smurfs will be no more. blast I don't understand what went wrong, Azrael. I followed mother's recipe right down to the last.. [Gargamel screaming] ...drop. [sobbing] Hit it smurf, squirrel, I have it. I got it, Papa Smurf. Guess my eyes aren't as good as they used to be. Thank you, squirrel, and happy holiday to you. (Gargamel) 'Oh, Azrael, to think Christmas is almost upon us' 'and those vile little Smurfs are out there' 'singing, dancing and laughing.' It's enough to make me throw up. If I can only get my hands on their rotten blue hides, I.. [knocking on door] 'Now what? Hello?' Who are you? Please come, sir. Our sleigh overturned and our grandfather won't open his eyes. Will you help us? [stammering] Do you have any money? - No. - Then go away! I'm busy. Oh-ho, he's mean. Yes, he is. Come, William, we'll find someone else to help us. (male #2) 'My niece and nephew should've been here hours ago.' 'Never should've allowed them' to make the trip with their grandfather. - Organize a search party. - Yes, sir. [Smurfs in unison] ♪ La la la-la la la La la-la la la ♪ (William) 'You think grandfather's gone to Heaven, Guinevere?' He'll be alright, William. Just hope someone will help us. [growling] The nerve of those little brats, Azrael. Interrupting me and my work. Now, let's see, where was I? 'Ah, yes. Two drops of bat spit.' No, no, no, this recipe will never do. The Smurfs, there must be a way to destroy them. [door opens] Who-who are you? Who I am is not important. What is important is that I can give you the power to destroy the Smurfs. And what in exchange? I want the two children who are lost in the forest. [stammering] May I ask why? Revenge, a simple revenge. The children's uncle, the good bailiff by the very nature of his goodness constantly meddles in my affairs. 'He's stopped me from doing my evil deeds' time and time again. Now I will make him suffer by kidnapping the children. 'Of course, I would've picked them up myself' but, alas, goodness comes my way only by betrayal. That's where you fit in. I see. And the Smurfs? 'This scroll will tell you how to find the Smurf village' and what to do when you get there. Yes, yes, I'll leave right away. Children first, Smurfs second. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Of course, of course, I.. [Azrael screeching] Yoo-hoo! Children! Now where can those two brats be? Yoo-hoo, children! Hello! We're looking for two lost children. My niece and nephew. Have you seen them? No, no, I haven't. There's been an accident. Their grandfather's sleigh overturned. He's alright, thank goodness, but we can't find the children. Oh, the poor dears. I shall certainly keep an eye out, sir. I'm offering a reward, ten gold coins for their safe return. [stammering] Ten gold? Well, that is generous. But the main thing is that the dear children are safe. Oh, I do pray that they are well. Well, keep an eye open, I'm sure we'll find them. 'And a Merry Christmas to you, my good man.' Merry Christmas to you all! Ten gold coins, eh? Perhaps, Azrael, there is a way to have it all. The Smurfs and the gold. Ha ha ha. Yoo-hoo! Children! I'm scared, Guinevere. Poor grandfather. He's alright, William. Everything is going to be alright. [wolf howling] ♪ Silent night ♪ [Guinevere singing] ♪ Silent night ♪ Shh, listen, Papa Smurf. - That sounds like ah-ah-ah-- - 'A child.'

Our sleigh overturned and-- - Where is your grandfather? - He's with the sleigh. Hefty, Brainy and Clumsy, find that sleigh. [speaking in unison] Yes, Papa Smurf! Smurfette, go back to the village. I need help with these children. Yes, Papa Smurf. Now there, children, don't you worry. Are you Santa Claus? [chuckles] Santa Claus? Me? There it is! Come on! Whoa! (Clumsy) 'Oh, Hefty.' See a grandfather anywhere, Brainy? Absosmurfly not, Hefty. But there certainly have been a lot of humans about. Well, we might as well head back and report to Papa Smurf. Hey! Hefty! Brainy. Look at this. What's it say, Hefty? What it says is not the point, Clumsy. What it means is the real issue here. Oh, get on with it! [clears throat] "Guinevere and William, grandfather is alright. "Stay with the sleigh, I will return. I love you. Uncle Edgar." The message is clearly not meant for us. 'Yet here we are, three small blue specks' in a white wilderness. Hey, wait for me! The trick, Azrael, is to turn the children over to the stranger, destroy the Smurf village and then lead the rescue party to the stranger and receive the reward. Oh, it's perfect, Azrael. A plan made in Heaven. Yoo-hoo! Children! Wait till grandfather finds out we saw Santa Claus. And all his helpers. All that delicious wonderful pudding and I haven't even had one little-- Greedy Smurf, don't be so selfish. It's holiday time, you're supposed to give, not receive. And since you're far away from home on this Christmas Eve I would like you to have this little gift. Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you, Santa. Uh, what's a Santa? Oh, it's so beautiful. Thank you. Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! I found the sleigh, Papa Smurf. There was a note. 'It was from your uncle' 'and he says your grandfather is alright, and--' And he wants you both to stay with the sleigh because he'll be back. That is good news. Oh, Santa, I'm so happy. I can hardly wait to see grandpa and my dear, sweet uncle. Do we get to finish opening our presents before we leave? Why, of course, William. All of it. I hate presents. Oh, have a heart, Grouchy. Have a heart. [orchestral music] This is a little song we sing every holiday. It's very old.

(William) 'Santa, help us, help us!' Quiet, you brats, or I'll feed you to my cat. Come along, Azrael. 'We'll take care of the Smurfs later.' Oh, Papa Smurf, what does that mean ol' Gargamel want with the children? I don't know, Smurfette, but I'm sure he's up to no good. What do we do, Papa Smurf? There's only one thing we can do, Brainy. Follow them! (William) 'Please, let us go.' What will you do with us? That's my little secret. Gargamel! The children are mine now as agreed. Yes, yes, of course, of course. As agreed. Here, here, take them. Take them. (Gargamel) 'My word is as good as gold.' (stranger) 'Yes, I'm sure it is.' Stranger, something about him. And now, as agreed here is the means for destroying the Smurf village. [all gasping] Alright, children, go with the nice gentleman. I'm sure he has a lovely Christmas present for both of you. Indeed, I do. 'Now, come along.' Oh, Papa Smurf, how can anyone be so mean? (Gargamel) 'Well, I must be on my way.' Oh, and a Merry Christmas to you, children. What about our village? It'll have to wait, Vanity. These two children come first. [Gargamel laughing] 'I found you at last, Smurfs.' Come out and meet your doom. Smurfs? Smurfs? Smurfs! They're gone, Azrael! Oh, but no matter, they'll be back. Oh, glorious night, I'll just start without them. [laughing wickedly] "Evil forces, all that's foul. Witches brew, demon's howl. "Come destroy the Smurfs' good cheer. Let not one survive this year." (Gargamel) 'Oh, it worked!' [laughing] 'Oh, they'll be hungry and homeless. Miserable!' And now, to collect my ten pieces of gold. 'Merry Christmas, Smurfs!' They can't be far ahead, Papa Smurf. Well, let's keep our distance until we know what he's up to. Hello! I found the children! A stranger, wearing a cape, was spiriting the poor little dears 'off through the forest.' Oh, no! I tried to rescue them. Oh, how I tried. And I nearly lost my life to that mad man's anger. Which way did the scoundrel go? That way, across the ice and through those trees. - Let's go, men! - 'Wait!' What about my reward? My ten pieces of gold. You shall have it when we find the children. Oh, this is disappointing, quite! [Azrael screeching] A contract is a contract. And you have broken ours. Me? Oh, no, no, no, no. You misunderstood. You see, I was on-- 'Silence!' Now, you'll come with me. [stammering] Well, I'd like to, but I have other business to attend to. [hissing] Oh, yes, yes. Yes, I'll go. I'll go. Anything you say, anything. Just call them off. Please! After you, Gargamel. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Look, Papa Smurf, Gargamel and Azrael have joined them. Oh, poor William! Poor Guinevere. Perhaps even poor Gargamel. [Smurfs in unison] Poor Gargamel? (William) I can't walk anymore, mister. Where are you taking us? This place will do nicely. Eh, then you won't be needing me, so I'll just-- 'On the contrary, someone as nasty as you' is always of use to me in my work. [stammering] Bu-bu-bu-but-- Therefore, you'll accompany me and the children on what I regard as the final journey. You said no more walking. We won't be walking, my dear child. Where are you taking us? Home, my home. I'm quite sure you'll like it. No, no, I won't go! No one leaves until after the ceremony. (Guinevere) Please, you're scaring me. Fire, fire burning bright take us home this very night. Oh, stop, please stop! Stop it, please! I'll be good, I promise, I'll be good! Oh, smurf is us, we're too late! Yes, too late! - Perhaps not. - Yeah, perhaps not. But, Papa Smurf, what can we possibly do against his evil power? There is one greater power. The power of love. You must sing, my little Smurfs.
