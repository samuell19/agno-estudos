I have the reservation here for you and Mr. Dickens in room 357... Ooh, Dickens! Thank you. Dickens! [telephone rings] Merry Christmas. You've reached the Hotel Fontaine, your home for the holidays. This is Georgia speaking. How may I help you? You can help me by coming outside and giving me a hand with all of this stuff. Kiki, great. You're here. I will be right out. - Ooh, Georgia! - [gasps] Florence! Did the champagne arrive yet? Oh, yes. All 20 cases. - Great. - You really got the good stuff, huh? Christmas only comes once a year. - Yep. - There you go. Thank you. [gasps] Oh, uh, that goes outside by the front door to the right, please. Thank you so much. - [screams] - Oops. - Oh, my God. Thank you, Milton. - [laughs] Who knew the Christmas rush would be so hazardous this year? [gasps] Oh! Oh, uh, the bedside table lamp in 209 needs a fresh bulb, 414 needs fresh batteries in the remote, and 327 has a leaky tub. Leaky tub. Yeah, I'm all over it. - You're the best. Thank you, Milton. - [phone chimes] Uh-hmm. Thank you. Ho, ho, ho, how about a donation? Ho, ho, yourself. How about some help? Well, if you give me a donation, I'll give you some help. Where is your Christmas spirit, Santa? Left it up north with the other reindeer. I'm so sorry it took so long. I had no idea how hard it would be to find a partridge in a pear tree. So, I had to go with the macaw. As my head concierge, you shouldn't have to be schlepping all of this, but with my extra holiday time staff comes in tomorrow, hopefully. Don't worry about it. What are best friends for, if not to schlep a little yuletide cheer? Besides, I should really be thanking you for letting me organize this whole Jingle Mingle party myself this year. Jingle Mingle, what is that? It's our annual Christmas Eve party for singles who wanna mingle. [Kiki] And also, for singles who are not ready to mingle. Basically, it's a Christmas party for anyone who doesn't have something to do on Christmas Eve. Where's my invitation? Every party needs a Santa Claus. Not one on the naughty list. Hey, I see you when you're sleeping, you know? Creepy! I'm Santa... I'm Santa Claus! It was a Santa joke! Just a whiff of white truffle, chef? Just a whiff. Et voila! [Victor] You know you go through a lot of trouble making Georgia lunch every day? It's not trouble. Besides, it's not the point. That is the point. You've been working here for over a year now. And she still doesn't know how you really feel, does she? Victor, Georgia and I are just friends. Good friends. All right, chef. Just because you and Anna are sneaking around doesn't mean that we all are. Uh, we ain't sneaking around. I mean, you won't tell anybody, right? Look, Anna just wants to keep it on the down low, all right? Your secret's safe with me. Oh, hey, Anna. How you doing? Luke, hi! Little last-minute Christmas shopping? Oh. [chuckles] Yeah, sort of. If it's for Victor, you better hide it. He's right in there. How did you... Victor doesn't want anyone to know. Know what? [sighs] Oh, my God. Okay. Wow. Let me guess. Kiki made the sign. Her marketing instincts are great. She's just a little heavy-handed on the glitter. At least it is covering the giant crack in the wall. They say cracks let the magic in. [sighs] I'm afraid I don't believe in magic. - [Luke] Well, do you believe in lunch? - [Georgia] Oh, my God. You don't have to keep doing this for me. You know that. Hey, making lunch for you is the highlight of my day. Well, you making lunch for me is the highlight of my day. So take some time and eat. [sighs] Oh, God. There's just so much I have to get done before Christmas Eve. The lights. The lights on the fifth floor aren't working. I forgot to tell Milton. Oh, my God! So they can use candles. It adds mystery. This rug is ancient. I have to change this rug! Not ancient. Vintage. Does that tree look crooked to you? [Luke] A little. I think it's the weight of all the ornaments. I wanted to get matching ones this year, I just ran out of time. No, I thought that was the whole point of our tree. People bring their own ornaments. Makes it feel like home. [chuckles] Hey, not bad. Not bad for a seven-year-old. I remember it took me a whole week to make that. I guess I always knew I was gonna grow up to work with food. What's the matter? Is it cold? No, no. It's perfect. It's just... I'm so lucky to have you. You're such a good chef. You know you could do a lot better than this old hotel of ours. I love this old hotel of ours. And the way I look at it, it's not always the place that's important. Sometimes it's the people. [crowd chattering] Oh, my God! Now what? Thank you. Ugh, glitter. [Jimothy] Hey, enough photos. Enough photos. Stop with the flash. No. No, you do not have a release. Thank you. Move, move, move. Not the cameras. Not the cameras, please. No flash. No flash. [upbeat music playing] Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine, your home for the holidays. [Jimothy] We have a reservation. Of course. And the name is... Seriously? This is Pandora. You probably heard her last release. Love, Love, Love is All Couture to Me. [Pandora chuckles softly] Never mind, Jimothy. Nobody did. That's why we're here. Guru Peterson. That's my life coach, Guru Peterson. He says I need a simple zen space to ground myself for the holidays. Okay. Of course. Here you are. We have you in a queen room. Avenue view, it's very simple, very cozy, very zen. Cozy sounds... small. How about a king? Hmm. Okay. Uh, junior suite? Hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay. How about the presidential suite? - [breathes deeply] - We'll make it work. Great. We will have your bag... s brought right up. [Pandora] Uh-hmm.

Well, thank you so much, Milton. Oh, you're welcome. [sighs] Funny thing about this sink, you know what, that's the third time that faucet has come loose in the past week. You'd almost swear somebody is doing it on purpose. Well, that's crazy. Why would anybody wanna sabotage my sink? - Yeah. Weird. - Weird. I thought I told you to stop that. Checking in. [Georgia] Of course. And your name is... Prince Raymond. Hello. Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine. It is an honor to have you here. Thank you. It's just Raymond though, no Prince. Right. I knew that. I just read about you giving up your title. Yes. And I'm trying to keep a low profile, you understand? The Hotel Fontaine is famous for its discretion with guests. Instead of two turtle doves, what if I went with a couple of rabbits? - Prince Raymond. - [Georgia] Kiki. What? This is Prince Raymond of Caspernia. Not anymore. He quit. Oh. Well, so then you're not in town looking for a princess? Please, forgive my associate. She has inhaled too much Christmas glitter. [sighs] Stop. I'm sorry about him. He's taken my abdication rather badly. He refuses to quit. I don't even think the earpiece is attached to anything anymore. [both chuckles] So your, um, not Royal Highness? Just Raymond is fine. Just Raymond. Is this your first time visiting in New York? Yes, actually. I want to get as far away from my family this year for the holidays as possible. Well, my name is Georgia. I am the hotel manager. And if there's anything at all that I can do for you, please, don't hesitate to ask. Yes, we are all yours. Thank you for your help. No. Kiki, what was that? You are not going to believe this. But I dreamt about him last night. This has to be some kind of sign. - I mean, look. - Yes. It's a sign that you should stop reading that stuff. There is some kind of Christmas magic happening here. The prince and I are obviously meant to be. Kiki, I hate to break this to you but there's no such thing as magic. So how do you explain the prince walking through the front door of our hotel? [phone chimes] Kiki, will you keep an eye on the front desk for me, please? Yes. Wow! Thank you! Kiki, just watch the front desk. All right? Don't move. Okay. But don't be surprised if you come back and I am suddenly Princess Kiki. [whispers] Okay. [exhales deeply] [strident music playing] [Milton grunts] I should have this fixed for you in no time, Georgia. Get that water working on 310, too. Great. Thank you, Milton. Um, is it possible for you to maybe come back a little later? Sure. Yeah, I mean, you're the boss. [grunts] Yeah. Everything okay? Yes. Yes. - Totally. Everything's fine. - Yeah. Yeah, I have to make a phone call. That's it. - [Milton] All right. - Yeah. Thank you. Well, yeah, if you need me, you know where to find me, yeah? - Sure do! - [both chuckle] - You okay? - I'm okay. Yeah, thank you. All right. Great. Thanks. [exhales heavily] [Fontaine] I must say, Georgia. You present a very persuasive argument and, uh, the design you sent for the proposal, they look magnific. So innovative, so modern. Thank you, Madame Fontaine. The problem is... I hate modern. That's why we keep Hotel Fontaine to preserve the past, the elegance, the way of life. Right. But you wouldn't have to give any of that up. The Auberge Moderne would be the Hotel Fontaine's cool modern counterpart right here in New York City. I understand all of that, Georgia. But, uh... Oh, merci, Jean Luc. This sounds like a great big deal of extra work and I hardly have time to spend on my yacht as it is. That's the beauty of my proposal. You wouldn't have to do anything. I would take on full responsibility as the executive director while you continue to travel as much as you like. And all I'm asking for in return is... Forty-nine percent of the ownership. I think that's fair. [laughs] Oh, your ambition reminds me so much of myself when I was your age. And I must say, you've done a wonderful job over the past two years for me with the hotel. And I often say you are the daughter I never had. Really? Does this mean you'll do it? No. Oh. Uh, okay. Well, thank you anyway. And Madame, would you please not mention this to any of the staff here at the hotel? I wouldn't want them to know I was thinking about leaving and it might rub them the wrong way. Wait, what if... I invest half? Half? You come up with the rest and we'll see if we do. Madam Fontaine, you know I don't have access to that kind of money. Oh, but I know you to be a very clever young girl. And I suspect that when you put your mind to something, there is nothing you can't do. Merry Christmas, Georgia. [cheerful music playing] [Luke] You're too early, you know... for Santa. He's not due for another four days. How do you always know where to find me? Lucky guess. Plus, Kiki told me you were going somewhere to think. And this is where you always go to think. Christmas toast? [glasses clink] You know me really well. I know when something's bothering you. What's up? Nothing. [sighs] Nothing. Just a plan that didn't work out. What kind of plan? Actually, Luke, do you mind if we don't talk about it? Yeah. Yeah. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. Thank you. I just don't wanna end up like my parents. You know what I mean? Like, they worked so hard their whole lives. They came to this country with nothing, and they didn't even get to own their own home. I just... [inhales deeply] I want to have something to call my own. We're not talking about it, though. - Sorry. - [both chuckle] No problem. Is there anything I can do to help? Not unless you got a big pile of cash somewhere you wanna loan me. You know I would if I did. [glasses clink] How do rich people get so rich anyway? Oh, that's easy. - They never spend their own money. - What do you mean? Well, if they wanna buy something, they find someone else to pay for it.

Maybe like a supervisor or... You are the supervisor. Merry Christmas to you, too. [Kiki] I had to hit five different pet shops today, and most of them had never even heard of French hens. - [chicken clucking] - Still sticking with the whole 12 Days of Christmas theme, huh? [Kiki] Yeah. You know what happens when I set my mind to something. Speaking of... I dreamt of Prince Raymond again last night. Kiki, you know you're not supposed to bother the guests. I'm not gonna bother him. I'm just gonna let him know that we are destined to be together. I hope he doesn't think I'm just after him for his money. I mean, he is a prince, right? He's probably got billions. Cream and sugar? Right. There you go. [singing] ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪♪ From your secret love...? [whimsical music playing] Ooh...

You know, I'd rather hope that being an ex-royal would mean I'd have some privacy now and then. Now it seems I can't even leave the hotel. Come with me. I cannot believe I didn't think about this sooner. Not many people know about these stairs. The hotel uses them for deliveries, but it's not that pretty. [Raymond] Oh, it's absolutely fine. Do you have any idea how bored I am withe people bowing and bloody trumpets going off every time i walk into a room? This is a very nice change of pace. It isn't quite the New York that tourists see, but it's private. And here, you can use this during your stay with us. I very much appreciate this, Georgia. Thank you. Of course. If there's anything else that I can do for you, please just let me know. Actually, I do need some help navigating your city. I don't suppose you know anyone who's up for the task.

Can you watch the front desk for me? I should be back in about an hour or so. Actually... make that two. [hopeful music playing] - Oh, there you are. - [Georgia gasps] Luke. Hi. I... I am heading out for my lunch break. Wait, wait. You are going on a lunch break? Well, it's Christmas. [chuckles] Wait. Before you go, I want you to try this new eggnog I was thinking of serving at the Jingle Mingle. I'd love to. [Luke] It's my own recipe. I have an in with the dairy farmer at the Christmas market. Oh, my God. This is incredible. Thank you. I have to go. I'm sorry. Oh. Where are you headed? Out. Perfect. I'll come with you. I wanted to grab some stuff from the market anyway. No. No. I... I don't wanna get in your way. You're not gonna get in my way. You're just saying that to be nice. I'll see you later. Bye. [Georgia] So you've been a prince your whole life? That is generally how monarchies work, yes. Yeah. I knew that. [chuckles] Oh. [chuckles] Force of habit. He's also my food taster back at the palace. - [chuckles softly] - Oh. Oh, I got it. Thanks. So, um, why did you leave? Well, that's a good question. I suppose I just got tired of it all. I just wanted a change, something new. Then of course there's my father, he was in charge of my life. [scoffs] It's like he's the king or something. I guess the real truth of it is that I just got sick and tired of sharing everything with 11 brothers and sisters. I wanted something that was just my own. Raymond, I have an idea. [elevator bell dings] [exhales deeply] [Kiki] You have hoops? Five of them? And they're golden? Thank you. I will be right there. Can I help you? You don't know who I am? Should I? Are you a guest here? I'm Pando... um... Pam? Oh, wait. Are you one of the temps that Georgia hired for the Jingle Mingle? - Uh... - The Christmas Eve party? [Pandora] Uh, yes. Yes. Uh, yes. Yes, that's it. I'm a temp. An absolute normal, everyday temp. Great. That's perfect. We got to go because we've got to pick up something from the Christmas market. Uh, don't you have people for that? Yeah, us. Come on. [sighs] Oh, what, uh, what's this for? [clicks tongue] Milton, by the power vested in me by the Innkeepers Association of America, I am officially putting you in charge until I get back. [Milton] Wow. Come on. [chuckles] [telephone ringing] [Milton] Oh. [sighs] Bonjour. Joyeux Noel. This is the Hotel Fontaine, your home for the holidays. How may I help you? [crowd murmuring] - Let's go. - Oh. Where's Santa's little helper going off to this time? -It's a Christmas secret, Santa! [bell ringing] [Pandora] I wonder what he looks like under the beard? Dickens... Dickens! Dickens! [flowing waltz playing] You don't even have to lift a finger if you don't want to. You bring the capital. I'll be the executive director, and we will split the 49% ownership stake. To be honest, I'm not exactly looking to get into the hotel business. Why not? Okay. Look down there. Did you know that during the holiday season, an average of 800,000 people pass through Rockefeller Center every day? [inhales sharply] You know, my father built an indoor rink at the palace once. First time I tried skating, I broke my ankle. [chuckles] The point is, all of those people need somewhere to stay. And modern hotels are the fastest growing segment of the hospitality industry. I very much appreciate that, but I don't know why I would put any roots down here. I don't know the city at all. And I'm planning to leave the day after Christmas. Which gives me just enough time to show you around. - But I... - Will you at least give it a chance? Look, if I don't convince you that this city is a good investment by Christmas, you can hop on your jet and fly off to anywhere else in the world. But... if you fall in love with New York... I must warn you. I was a prince, so I'm pretty difficult to impress. Clearly, you've never met New York. Deal? [chuckles softly] So you've seen my jet? [joyful marketplace chatter] [Kiki] Do you think these like geese need to actually lay the eggs or do you think they can kind of just sit on top of them? I feel like it's gonna be kind of hard to... [sighs] ...do you remember how excited you used to get about Christmas when you were a kid? Actually, I don't. Wow. Christmas buzzkill. Come on. [Pandora] Honestly, there wasn't much time between the dance rehearsals, and singing classes, and piano lessons. You know, like, like any normal kid. Well, in that case, we need to make up for lost time. We start with the head first. Oh, no, I can't. That is nothing but sugar and baked lard. Yeah, that's basically what Christmas is. Come on. I know the best hot chocolate stand in the city. [chuckles softly] [flustered hubbub] [barking] Hey, buddy. You lost? Dickens... Well, it is Christmas. Okay, Dickens, let's find out where you live. [Georgia] They say that a million kids visit this market at Christmas. In fact, over 60 million tourists visit New York City - every year, all year round. - [chuckles] And you just have this information at your fingertips? I have been working on this proposal for a really, really long time. - I have done my research. - Yes, I can see that. This new hotel isn't just a real estate investment for you, is it? No...[exhales deeply] no. It... it means the world to me. Look, Georgia, I appreciate your enthusiasm. And New York is obviously a massive tourist destination. But... [sighs] the truth is, I'm just not sure I'm looking to invest in a business right now. I see. Do you mean right now, right now or do you mean right now as in never? You know what? Why don't we discuss this over dinner? I would like that. I've never had dinner with a real prince before. Well, then we're even, I've never had dinner with a real hotel manager before. [Georgia chuckles softly] How about 8:00? And seeing as you're the authority on all things New York, I'll leave the where of it up to you. That is easy. I just happen to know the best chef in town. [Luke] A prince? He used to be. He used to be? I didn't know you could "use to be" a prince. The thing is, he doesn't want anybody to know about it. So we need to eat somewhere private. There will only be two of us. Well, three of us, technically, but I don't think his bodyguard eats anything but protein shakes and the occasional cow. How did you end up having dinner with this guy? You know, it's kind of complicated. Can we just do 8:00, please? Yes, we sure can. You're the best. Thank you so much. - How's the broth, chef? - Good, chef. Oh, also, remember he is royalty, so I need you to make us something that's really going to impress him. He's back to being a prince now? No problem, G. Bring him to the roof at 8:00. The roof? You said private? Well, yeah but... Don't worry about a thing, okay? I am making the best dinner he's ever had. What would I ever do without you, Luke? Thank you. What are you looking at? Come on. We got dinner to make, chef. [sighing] [bell ringing] We still need to get the inflatable pool for the swimming swans and, of course, the swans, so we better get an early start tomorrow. I will see you in the morning at 8:00. [scoffs] Don't be silly. 8:00 doesn't come in the morning. Does it? [Georgia] Kiki, what are you doing? - Didn't Milton tell you? - Tell me what? I put him in charge of the front desk. I gave him the badge and everything. [Georgia] Kiki, I love Milton, but he already has a job. This hotel will literally fall apart without him. He doesn't have time to be checking in guests. Okay. But he's doing a great job at the front desk. Kiki, that's not the point. The point is that this isn't how you're supposed to run a hotel. Okay, Georgia, you know the Fontaine isn't like other hotels. You're right. It isn't. [sighs] I can't wait to get out of here. Can't wait to what? Georgia. Georgia. Georgia, wait. - Are you Kiki? - Yeah. Sign here for you geese. Oh. Thank you. [squawks] [swinging Christmas rock playing] [Luke] Thanks, Milton. I could never get these things to work... [dreamy music playing] Wow. Wow. Do I look okay? You look more than okay. You look... more than okay. You look... you look more than okay. Thanks. I really wanna make a good impression. Yeah, of course. I mean, he's a prince, right? It's not like you're having dinner with some commoner. [chuckles] I'll see you upstairs. Yeah. Yeah, see you upstairs. I think it's a bit of a pity you're not dining together. Yeah. We're just friends, Milton. What makes you think we should be together? Oh, I don't think you should be together. Everybody thinks you should be together. [chuckles] [sighs] Where have you been all day? I went to a Christmas market. Excuse me? I even ate a gingerbread man that I'm almost 100% certain was not gluten-free. So why can't I come up with a new song? Maybe this will inspire you. Look. I bought you more nice, normal clothes for you to wear for Christmas. Oh. Ho, ho, ho! [sighs] This is a disaster. If I don't have a new hit song soon, my career is over. What am I gonna do? [sighs] [Holiday vibes playing] Hmm... Just, um, put that on my bill. Good evening, mademoiselle, and monsieur, and monster. Welcome to Restaurant de Luke. Follow me. Prince, sorry, Raymond, allow me to introduce you to Chef Luke. Pleasure to meet you, Chef. And you... you are welcome here. Welcome. Thank you. Please. - [clears throat] - Raymond is visiting New York City for the first time, Luke. - Oh, is he? - Yeah. And yet it seems as though he's made himself right at home. [clears throat] - Well, it's an easy city to love. - [Georgia chuckles] - Not if it doesn't love you back. - [Georgia] Chef Luke. I'm sure you have things to do in the kitchen. Don't let us keep you. Yes. Yes, of course. Enjoy your wine. Yeah. Do you know who that is? - Georgia said he was a prince. - Yeah. He's also the guy that was with her this afternoon. What does that matter? They're just having dinner. [stammers] This isn't just dinner. Look at this. Okay. Well, whatever it is, the lobster appetizers are ready to serve. You want me to fire up them fillets now? The fillet? No, no, no, no, no. There's gonna be a change of menu. To our partnership. [Prince Raymond] Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I haven't made my decision yet. Right. My father always says it's best to discuss business on a full stomach. One of the few things we actually agree on. You know, I would really appreciate it if we could keep all of this between the two of us. I'm not ready to tell the hotel staff about it yet. [chuckles] We'll keep it between us then. Your secret is safe with me. Thank you. It must have been fun growing up in a palace? Not always. There are very strict rules, curfews, elocution lessons, apparel guidelines. You know, I've never worn sweatpants in my life. - [gasps] Criminal. - [chuckles] [Georgia] No wonder you ran away. I'm aware of how that sounds. No, actually, I... I really, really get it. When I moved to New York, it was like the first independent thing I ever did. It was like I finally owned my own life. And now, you want to own your own hotel. [Luke] Dinner is served. Oh, fantastic. I'm obviously famished. [Luke] Tonight's specialty of the house is an old New York City recipe that's been passed down in my family for generations. We only use farm to table ingredients that have been handcrafted with artisanal attention to detail and served at a perfect temperature of 104 degrees. I present to you... - Pizza. - [Prince Raymond] Pizza. Yes. Well, we also have a selection of curated toppings. I would recommend... the, uh, cracked pepper, of course, simpler is always better. Don't you agree? Chef Luke, may I have a word in private? - Of course. - Excuse us. After everything we spoke about and you served him pizza? I thought you said you always liked my pizza, G? Are you trying to ruin this for me? This? I... I don't even know what this is because you won't tell me. I can't, okay? I'm sorry. Not yet. It's just... it's really important to me. Yeah, well, it must be. You spent the whole day together. What? How do you know that? Because I saw you. - Are you spying on me? - [scoffs] Spy... don't try to change the subject, all right? I saw him kiss your hand. He's a prince. That's what they do. Besides what difference does it make to you anyway? Oh, nothing... none, none. It makes no difference to me. Raymond. Hi. Sorry. There was an emergency in the kitchen, but I will be right back at the table. Well, you better hurry up. There's not gonna be any left. I was never allowed to eat pizza at the palace. They say it wasn't fit for a prince. But this, Chef Luke. Hmm. This is incredible. This is one of the most delicious meals I think I've ever tasted in my life, so bravo. Uh, thank you. Thanks. [Prince Raymond] If this is any indication of New York City cuisine, might've stick around after all. I have to get back to the table. My pizza's getting cold. G. [sighs] Sorry, brother. Come on. - Let's go. - [Luke sighs] No, it's okay. Yeah. I love you. Everything okay, Flo? Yeah. Oh, yeah, everything's fine. Just my son and my daughter-in-law aren't gonna be able to make it in for Christmas dinner after all, so... I'm sorry. Yeah. Which leaves me with a whole lot of turkey for one person. - [chuckles] - [Milton chuckles] So you done for the night? Yeah. Uh, pretty cold out there, so I sure am glad I have this beautiful new scarf. [Florence] Oh, yeah. Well, it's very becoming on you. [laughs] Oh, thank you. [sighs] Well, good night, Milton. Well, have a good night, Flo. Good night, Anna. Good night. Oh... Oh, no. My gift for Victor... [solemn guitar playing] [Prince Raymond] You know, I don't think your Chef Luke like me very much. No. I wouldn't say that. [laughs] Luke is just passionate. You know how chefs are. So you've known him for a long time then? I've been friends with Luke for a very long time. I can't even imagine the hotel without him. Just friends? Oh, my gosh. I love that window. [chuckles] [toy train whistling] [giggling] You know, I heard that there are over eight million mechanical elves in New York City on a given moment. Ha-ha. [Prince Raymond] You're not the only one with information at their fingertips. [Georgia] I am just trying to help you make a sound business decision based on facts and logic. The truth is, I haven't made many big decisions in my life. My last one, abdicating the throne, wasn't based in logic at all. I guess that's going to be true of my next decision, too. Are you serious? [chuckles] Very. I looked at your proposal. I think you'd be a great business partner. You're not kidding, right? He's not kidding, right? No. Not kidding. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - [laughs] - [Prince Raymond] Careful. You know, there are paparazzis hiding. We don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. Sorry. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. [both chuckle] [Georgia] So the Prince has agreed to invest half the cost But I heard that Prince Raymond has left the throne, didn't want to be a part of the royal family anymore. Silly boy. Well, yes, but he is looking to expand his interests. The thing is, he is leaving New York right after Christmas, so... So in that case, I suggest... Jean-Luc, I'm thirsty. Yes. What do you suggest? [Madame] I suggest you open a bottle of Champagne. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madame Fontaine. Thank you so much. Oh, don't thank me. Thank your prince. Now, go find us a shiny new hotel. Okay. [carolers] ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ Hey. Hi. I'm in the lobby. Where are you? [Dickens barking] Dickens... Hey. Thank you. Hey, I missed you so much. [Hunter] You must have been worried sick. Yeah. Do you have a dog? No, my apartment is too small. Even my plants complain. [laughs] He never used to run away. But he's been acting out ever since his other daddy and I broke up. [chuckles] I hope you don't mind. It was pretty cold out there so I, uh, got him a coat. There are matching boots too, in case you ever want the full outfit. Uh, I'll think about it. - How much do I owe you? - [Hunter] Forget about it. Think of it as an early Christmas gift from one divorcee to another. - Well, thank you. - You're welcome. Uh, I hear this Jingle Mingle party they put on every Christmas is pretty fun. If you're still in town, maybe we could check it out. Oh, um, thanks. But no, I... I can't. Oh, okay. I understand. I... I mean, I have work stuff that I got to get done, you know. [chuckles] No problem. [sighs] Well, take care of your dad, Dickens. It was nice meeting you, AJ. You too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. What? [carolers] ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... ♪♪ What do you think he meant by sticking around? Probably means he's gonna stick around. You saw the way he and Georgia were looking at each other. You dropped the ball on this one Luke and prince charming was right there to pick it up. Victor, I told you. Georgia and I are just good friends. Nobody believes that except for you and Georgia. And the only reason why she does is because you haven't told her how you really feel. Maybe I don't know how I really feel. I do. You feel like you wanna make lunch for her every single day for the rest of your lives. And if that ain't love, brother, I don't know what it is. So, what am I supposed to do about it? I'm no Prince, retired, or otherwise. You're gonna go down there, you're gonna give her this sandwich, and you're going to tell her the truth. The truth. You got this. [Kiki] Hey, I need to hire eight more temps for the party and they have to dress like milk-maids. Sure. Okay. Thanks. And I'm really sorry about not being here yesterday. Don't worry about it. Milton did a great job. - Oh, so, you're not upset. - No. Of course, I'm not. Oh, I thought you were mad, when you said "I couldn't wait to get out of here." Oh, that, that's just a figure of speech. Um, I have to run and do some Christmas errands. - I'll be back later, okay? - Okay. Oh, wait. I also need nine ballerinas. "Executive Director Georgia Clark"? - [Luke] Georgia. Georgia. - Oh, Luke. Sorry, I have to run out to go to lunch. I don't... Oh, going out to lunch again, getting to be a habit. Look, I'm sorry, okay, about last night with you and the prince. I behaved immaturely and I wanted to apologize. - It's okay, really. Don't worry... - No, it isn't. It isn't, really. The thing is, I acted like that because I... we, you know, you and me, we... uh, us. - Yeah. - Ah, there you are. - Hi. - Chef. - The car's waiting for us. - Oh, I'll be right there. Luke, can we pick this up later? I have to run. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. You, you got things to do, busy-bee... Hey. Everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. Here, you want a sandwich? - Yeah, it's just... - Oh, okay. Sure. Yeah. - And, uh, the spices for it, so. - Okay. Oh, okay. That's, uh, Ms. Kelly, room 304. - Oh, Anna. Good. - Uh-hmm. Uh, apparently, uh, some of our guests have spotted some goose droppings in the East Corridor. - Well, if you can tidy that up, please? - Sure. But, Milton, I have to talk to you about something. Oh, dear, that sounds important. It is. Uh, it's actually about your scarf. Oh, do you like it? A secret admirer left it for me in the supply closet. Confidentially, I think it was Florence. - Florence? - Uh-hmm. You know, actually, Anna, I could use your help. I wanna do something nice for her, but, well, my dating game is a little rusty. It's, uh, been 12 years since my wife passed and, uh, well, it's been some time since I've had to do anything like this. Do you have any ideas? Actually, Milton. The scarf was from me. What? I bought it for Victor. I was hiding it in the supply closet to give to him on Christmas Eve. But I found it first. - I am so sorry. - Oh, no, no, no. Anna, this is not your fault at all. Silly of me, anyway. Imagine me having a secret admirer at my age. Well, uh, back to work. You're one lucky dog, Dickens, being found by such a nice guy. [Dickens mewling] Oh... He's even got good taste in clothes. [Kiki] I just can't believe Georgia wouldn't tell me she's planning to leave the hotel. Maybe she wanted to keep it a secret. People keep secrets from each other all the time, right? Even when they're supposed to be best friends? I don't know. I never really had time for a best friend. Well, I am in the market for a new one, if you're interested. Thanks. Come on. You're gonna help me with these. Um, what am I supposed to do? Oh, we're gonna decorate the cookies and then put them on the tree for the Jingle Mingle. Oh, no, no, no. I better not. Why not? It's Christmas tradition. But what if I don't do it right? What if my cookies are a huge flop and nobody likes them and I never have another hit cookie again? Who cares if no one likes your cookies? Listen, some people don't like gingerbread. Some people don't like shortbread. Some people don't even like cookies at all. So you really can't worry what other people are gonna think. Sometimes, you just gotta make the cookies for yourself. Get to work. Oh. [Prince Raymond] You know, when I said I wanted to see New York, I didn't mean to see it all in one day. So far, we've seen a property that look like a prison. One, like a subterranean bunker, and there was that hole in the ground that I was actually beginning to consider until we were attacked by feral pigeons. I have to admit so far, Georgia, this isn't very encouraging. No, I know. Okay. Just... just wait until you see this one. Do you have a key? Better. I have an app. [Georgia] Look at this place. The realtor is starting to stage it for Christmas. - Oh, this is... - Beautiful. You took the words right out of my mouth. Look at that. That, now, that is a Christmas tree. Now, this... This is a proper restaurant for our hotel. The Viridian is the hotel's five-star award-winning dining experience. I know just the chef to do it justice. Chef Luke. Chef Luke? Erm... [chuckles] He's great at making pizza. I was thinking more along the lines of Otto Hans Becker. Has a Michelin star and he's the spoke chef to World Hunger Foundation. [Georgia] Chef Luke likes to help people too. Look, Georgia. I know that he's your friend, but... Our new hotel will need someone with reputation. Gravitas. Luke just isn't that. [discouraged music playing] So partner, what do you think? I think we found our hotel. Hey. Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you had matching boots to go with this jack... et. Hi. Hey. You work here? Actually, I own the place, and another uptown and one at the airport. Got 'em in the divorce. [chuckles] How do you own pet stores but not a dog? I do. About 30 of them, every day, right through that door. Hi, Dickens. [Dickens barks] - About yesterday. - If it's about the money, - don't worry about it. - No. I actually have something I wanna ask you. I would... I would really like to go to the Jingle Mingle at the hotel with you. And that is if you still wanted to go. Hmm, do I wanna go to the Jingle Mingle with you? Let me think about it. Yes, I do. [chuckles] What changed your mind? Nothing. It's just, um, I've only been single for about six months, you know? And I still get a little... skittish with, you know, this. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I've had about two years, and I still squirm every time someone asks for my phone number. What do you think? Should we try them on for size?

Can you just let me explain it. Wait... you're leaving the Hotel Fontaine? I wouldn't say leaving exactly. But you're going to work at another hotel? Well, sort of, but... Actually, she's gonna be working for her own hotel. Can we please just do this later? Georgia is going to be a part owner of our new Auberge Moderne. Oh, let me guess. This was your idea? No. Luke. It was mine. Look, I'm sorry to surprise everybody like this. It's just... I've always really wanted to own something, you know, and the... And the chance came up and... anyway, I hope you guys all really understand. Yes, I am leaving the hotel. But not tonight. And we'll always have the Jingle Mingle. Yeah. We can just make it into a going away party. Congratulations, Georgia. Really. It's a great opportunity. Yeah. Besides, you, you, you shouldn't stay in one place all your life. I mean, look at me. Oh, just stop it, Milton. I think it's wonderful, Georgia. Congratulations. Thank you. Luke. I'm really sorry I didn't tell you. I just didn't think it was gonna happen. No. Don't worry about it. Maybe you'll need a chef for the new place, right? Yeah. Yeah. Who knows. Got it. Right hotel, wrong chef. Well, I, uh, should head back up to the kitchen. Got a lot to prep for tonight. You're gonna be there, right? Yeah. Um, singles only. Congrats, G. Kiki. Kiki. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. - I just didn't know how I... - [Kiki] Don't worry about it. It's not like we're best friends or anything. Don't say that. I've got to go. I still have to find eleven pipers and twelve drummers and the party is less than six hours away. I have to admit, though, you finally convinced me. About what? Doesn't matter how much glitter you throw around. There really is no such thing as magic. [exhales sharply] [indistinct chatter] [clears throat] Well, the guests should be arriving in a couple of hours. Flo, anything I can help you with? Oh. Actually, there is. Have a seat, Milton. Oh, all righty... So, with it being Christmas Eve and all, and you and I being friends all these years. I thought, well... I... uh-hmm. - For me? - Yeah. Well, read the tag. Oh. - Yeah, that's me. [laughs] - [chuckles] Okay. Go ahead. Open it already. Okay. Sure. Sure. Well, this is... Oh, it's sweet of you. Oh, Flo. Well, you know, you looked really good in the red one, but I just thought that this went with your eyes better. Hmm. Ah. Great. Thank you. But I didn't get you anything. Oh, well, I've already thought about that. Remember I told you that my son and my daughter-in-law can't make it this Christmas? So, I was wondering if you would like to come to my place and help me eat all that goldarn turkey that I bought. Flo, I would like that very much. - [chuckles] - Great. I need to get back for the mingle, soon. But I really want to show you my idea for the lobby first. So I'm thinking we redo this whole reception area here. Oh, shoot. Madame Fontaine, I forgot to charge my phone so I might lose you, but what do you think? Whatever you like, Georgia. Okay. Great. Are you sure you don't wanna ask Jean-Luc? Jean-Luc is not here. He's found a more amusing way to vacation. There's got to be charger in here somewhere. Of course. [exhales sharply] Oh, the party. [groans] What? Oh, the app. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no. Hello? [mouthed] Can anybody hear me? Hello? Help! Hello? [indifferent city bustle] [Christmas party music playing] [Kiki] Has anyone seen Georgia? I've been calling her for like the last hour and it just keeps going to voicemail. What about the milkmaids? Them too? Great. That is just great. [laughs] If it isn't Little Miss Edwina Scrooge. You know what? Not tonight, Santa, okay? I've got no pipers, my drummers cancelled, and my lords 'a' leaping are stuck on the train from Brooklyn, along with the rest of the 12 Days of Christmas. I don't even have a... Hey, Santa. How'd you like to go to a party? Thought you'd never ask. [upbeat music playing] Well, Merry Christmas. Are we, uh, single or not yet ready to mingle? Um, single I guess. [chuckles] Single, it is. Enjoy. Thank you. Stop fidgeting. You look just fine. Now, this is a nice, normal party full of nice, normal people. [gasps] Thank you. This is going to be just the inspiration you need. [glasses clink] Something's wrong. I know it. This isn't like her. Perhaps, she changed her mind about coming. Georgia wouldn't do that. This party was her idea in the first place. She loves the Jingle Mingle. Well, maybe she doesn't love it anymore. [Prince Raymond] Listen, I think I know where Georgia is. - [knocking] - [Georgia] Help. Please, help me. Hello? Hi. Hi. [silence] Help, please. Help me get out, please. [silence] [groans] [sighs] [party swing playing] [man] I own a frozen yogurt store and our signature flavor is vanilla. In my free time, I collect vintage khakis, you know, from different eras in history. Some people believe that khaki originated in 1930s, but you can actually trace the origin of the pants to the 1840s. [chuckles] Excuse me. [sniffs] [sighs] If this is normal, I quit. [sighs] Look, I'm sorry. I'm just not ready to do this yet. Sorry, sir? Oh, just talking to the dog. Oh. Well, that's everything then. You're not joining everyone for the Jingle Mingle tonight? No, I'm not. Besides, what's so great about mingling, anyway? [barking] Dickens! Dickens! [excited barking] Dickens! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [panting] [elevator dings] "Good girll pose," Amazing. Perfect. Those are some real Santa selfies. You know where to find me afterwards if it gets too cold. Oh, speaking of... Thank you. Thank you. Santas are supposed to be having milk and cookies. Yeah, but this Santa wants champagne because I've been working incredibly hard for this. - I'm not dropping it. - [Kiki] Drop it! Drop it! - [thuds] - [sparks] [startled hubbub] [barking] Dickens. [barking] Just look at what you did, Santa. Santa! Dickens! Hi. Going somewhere? Um... I'll, uh, I'll go check the fuses, you keep them calm. - [clears throat] - What? What?! Hey, everyone. Wow. [laughs] What a Christmas surprise! I should ask Santa for new wiring! [dramatic music playing] [Luke] No, I thought that was the whole point of our tree? People bring their own ornaments. Makes it feel more like home. Look at that. Not bad for a seven-year-old. Hey, making lunch for you is the highlight of my day. [Kiki] It doesn't matter how much glitter you throw around. There really is no such thing as magic. [dramatic music playing] [groaning] [knocking] Oh, my God. [chuckling] Yes. Hi. Hi. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Oh, my God. Um, uh, can you get the app? [silence] You need to get an app for the building to open the door. There's that. [Kiki] All right, everyone. Lights will be back on in just a minute. Have some more champagne, right? Luke. Everybody's leaving. Can you get them to play some music or something? With what? The power is still out. My party-giving reputation is going to be over before it even started. I'm sorry. I really thought I could do this, but... Hey. Breakups are hard. You know? But you can't let it define your whole life. So how do you get past it? Maybe you don't. Maybe you just go through it. Sounds easier than it feels. Well, there's no rule that says you have to do it alone. [indistinct chatter] How long do you think it's gonna take to get the power back on? Beats me. Some things just take time, you know? Victor, I thought you didn't want anyone to know? I thought you didn't want anyone to know. Come here. Victor, people are looking. Good, because I want them to see this. Anna... I know this is only our first Christmas together, but I know I wanna spend all the rest of mine with you. Oh, he's doing it. Will you marry me? Yes.

So, I decided to get on the first flight and tell you something in person. Actually, um, I have something I have to tell you, too. - The deal is off. - The deal is off. What? I don't want another hotel. I want this hotel with you in it. I want you to be the Executive Director of the Hotel Fontaine. There will be a salary increase, of course, as well as another little incentive. Would you accept 49% ownership of the Hotel Fontaine? - What? - I just think that everybody deserves something extra at Christmas. I'll let you decide. Are you at the hotel? Let me show you to the bar. Um, did you just hear that? Uh-huh. I guess I'll be coming to you about a raise after the holidays. I have a better idea. How would you like the events and marketing position at the Hotel Fontaine? There is no events and marketing position. There is now. That is, if you'll forgive me. Oh, my gosh. Of course I forgive you. What are best friends for? But do you think you could keep an eye on the concierge desk for me for just a minute? I do have to drop these swans off before noon. Hand it over. Thank you. Oh, Georgia, I, uh, forgot to give you this back. Actually, Milton, why don't you keep it? No, no, no, I, I couldn't. I'm not the, uh... Sure you can. It goes with your new job. What? Really? [chuckles] Merry Christmas, Milton. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Wow. - So, Manager, huh? - Yeah. - [laughter] - Oh. - Here. Can I help you with that? - Oh, please. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. Well, I guess I'll need to get a new blazer to go with my green scarf. Oh. So, Milton, I have a confession to make. You do? Yeah. You know the bar sink that you always start with sabotaged. Oh, yeah, yeah. It was. It was? It was. Merry Christmas, Flo. Merry Christmas. [chuckles] - It was? - Yeah. [Hunter] So, when do you think you'll be back in New York? [AJ] Oh, probably tomorrow.
