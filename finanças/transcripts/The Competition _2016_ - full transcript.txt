Everyone meets in the amphitheater A film clip will be screened for you to analyze. But that doesn't mean... We're more interested in your response to the film than a technical or academic analysis, you see? It's really about your experience of cinema and your vision. So it's really hard to get in? Very few people get in. Yes, counting all applicants. But it depends: Lots of people apply for directing. There are fewer applicants for sound. And for the application project? There's no one approach? It's pretty unclear. It's unclear on purpose, to give you room to do what you like. The Competition If you have an appointment, please come forward. Thank you. You two can go in. Which department? Oh, yes. In you go, that way. Thank you very much. In you go, in you go. That way. You too. - Let's wait a moment. - All right, I'll stop. Hello. In you go. - We're going to wait a moment. - Okay. Next year we'll ask them for a printout... - Is it all there? - It is. - With the label inside? - It's all there. All in order. Look, it's in three parts. There's no point in stapling them together yet. Can you give me another envelope? Have we got an envelope? So they all go together? Shall I staple them together? No, I'd rather you didn't. It's three separate parts. - I was hoping they'd stay that way. - There are too many people. What label? I didn't receive a label. No, I didn't get a label. - You need to fill this out. - okay. I'm afraid you're going to have to move over to this side. So... It's time. It's about to start. I'll hold on to your ID. You left your name off the project? - Yes. - All set. - Cool. - Do you want an exam book? Is there scrap paper? Yes, and you can get more in there as needed. Okay, thanks. Hello, hello, hello. I'm Jean-Marc Vernier, Head of Admissions. A couple of things before we start: Are there any open seats? Are there any open seats? There are seats up here for those of you still looking. All set? Who still needs a seat? Over there. Okay, so we're going to show the first clip. We'll be turning out the lights, so it will be dark obviously. and then the film will start. You will be my doll. The rest of the time you will be free. You have made my dream come true. Thank you. Can I get you to sign here? That wasn't too bad, was it? It went okay? I hadn't seen the film though. I think lots of people won't have seen it. - Have you finished already? - Yes. - Did you enjoy it? - Yes, very much. We always wonder when the first ones come out. You ask yourself, "What didn’t... Why so fast?" - Hopefully it's not just about length. - No, no? It all depends. I said what I had to say. Did it go okay? Yes. Born in Rouen on September 9, 1992. It's important not to take it too seriously. Thank you. Maybe see you next year. Maybe, we'll see. It's really time to finish up. I see people writing. Time's up. Hand your papers in at the reception desk where you left your ID. You were warned, lights out. Most of you know the school. Most of you have participated in the past in Alain Bergala's effort to grade first-round entrance exam results, but it might help to go over what La Fémis is as it is today. At La Fémis there are no classes, there are no professors. You're probably saying to yourself, "That's odd." "What are they up to?" Coming back to what Alain said, the whole industry comes through this school each year and they pass on... their skills, so the entrance exam targets that approach. You decide who gets in, not us. And it's important to maintain this separation, so to speak, between those who train the students and those who select them. Jacques Kermabon. I edit "Bref" magazine. Judith Revault d'Allonnes. I'm in charge of programming at the Centre Pompidou cinema. Jacques Déniel. I run the Jean Vigo Cinema in Gennevilliers. I am also an editor for Yellow Now Editions which is publishing a book on John Ford in conjunction with the Cinémathèque. Michaël Dacheux. I'm a director. I help run workshops on directing and I write about the cinema. Xanaé Bove. I'm a screenwriter and director. I also write for "Culture au point" magazine. Claire Childéric, director of photography and documentary filmmaker. I help run workshops at the Cinémathèque and Paris 8. Joël Danet. I am a contributor. I work at Vidéo les beaux jours, a non-profit in Alsace that distributes documentaries and acts as a regional center for film studies. One good approach is to split the grades in half. The woman I worked with last year did that. She made a matrix, like, two points for presentation skills, to help you? We'll see. I'll figure something out. - See you. - See you. Bye. Bye. I had given it a better score, and after talking about it and I lowered it. But... I gave it 13 to begin with. I found the application interesting because she took risks. She'd tried to get around, to navigate as a blind person, with a guide, so there was a real commitment, I found it interesting. Apart from that... - What about visually? - There were photos. - It wasn't... - It was boring? It was not amazing. - What about you? - I thought none of it was interesting, the project or the presentation of it. Okay. Will we look at it again? No. The fifth and final candidate we wanted to look at is 2188. This is a candidate with weak but split project scores: 11 and 8. And then matching 14s on the clip analysis, very good scores. Let's start with the application project for candidate 2188. Who gave it 11 and 8? - Did you give it 8? - I was too harsh. - You were too harsh? - Yes. I was too harsh. There was something in the project which was really unfortunate and there was no structure. It's really very... But, in view of the rest, it's too harsh for the 8 to be the deciding factor? - What does it deserve? 10? - Yes. There was no real investigation so 7 was the best possible grade. Visually speaking it was just okay. Yes, very ugly. There's no depth, it's nothing but generalizations on a bunch of different things, money, theatre? no commitment and no artistic choice, period. It's more like a dissertation. Those who gave it 19, is this what you saw? Are you missing something? It was by far the best paper we read. Really the only exam without a mistake. The three scenes were there and the 15 shots. I found it hard to believe he could have done it in three hours. We were both equally enthusiastic When we met, when our 19s met, we were of course delighted to have found someone so wonderful. This is his downfall. It's a pity. Nadège, did you want to ask a question? I was wondering if I could just draw your attention to two applications in particular which were marked, at least at the project stage, by my fellow examiner. They were both excellent. I gave one in particular 19 and he gave it 17. It was of an exceptional caliber. It didn't even get a second look. It got two 6s. It is outstanding. It's a candidate whose writing is remarkable. It's very personal and at the same time political. it gets right to the heart of the matter, it's really not fair. It looks like someone who came to Paris for the written test, and messed it up, and it's really not fair to miss this one. I know there are rules but it's disgusting. It's number 1969. - At the bottom of the page. - Under "rejects". 69. I'm curious to know why. It's as if we were talking about two different people. We were both in total agreement about the film analysis. My conclusions were: "Lack of sensitivity, ill thought-out. I'm wondering if it was the same person. That's worth considering. - Perhaps it wasn't the same person. - Really? It does happen, you know, there are people who get someone else to make the project. You can't have "exceptional caliber" on the one hand and "ill thought-out" on the other. That's not what they were saying. Most of this type of exception, if I've understood correctly, not having seen the projects... - 19, 17, and then 6 twice, something's up. - Yes. Wouldn't it be worthwhile asking someone to... - There's nothing to be done. - I think we should systematically... Not only is there nothing to be done but we should trust our examiners. - Of course. - Equally. We should trust those who tell us, as Nadège has just done, that we're dealing with someone exceptional. We know under what conditions the test was carried out. And then we trust the other two graders, who are both saying, "We think it was ill thought-out and deserves a 6." When we're looking at a 19-6 split like this, we have to pay as much attention to the 6 as we do the 19. So, Agnès: you have... the application forms for each department Script supervisor. First year for script supervision. And you have round 2 for film directing. - Clément. - Production. Look at that guy's name. It means goat shepherd! What's your name, please? Sorry? And you said it was the editing department. With an A, right? Not an H? I'm sorry, but I don't see your name here. Sorry. Have a nice weekend all the same. Goodbye. Oh damn, wait? Four of my friends? - So did they?? - No, I don't see them? Yes, yes. So, script continuity. Yes, I can give you the result. With a D, as in Damien? I'm afraid not, no. - Yeah! - Someone you know? - A friend in directing, one of my best friends' younger brother, I'm happy for him. - None of my three friends got in. - None of them? Nor mine, and they were so sure. Oh, no. I'm shocked he didn't get in. He'll be so disappointed. There are 30 or so, each one gets a theme, they have 45 minutes to prepare? - Out of how many? - 40. - There were about 40 of them. - They'll pick a theme out of a hat. Right, as soon as they've finished... And an example of what they might get? It can be anything: a word, a few lines of dialogue? - Oh, okay. - A sentence, a particular subject? And after 45 minutes they come straight here. They tell you their story then you ask questions, about the story, the characters... It's as if you're co-screenwriters, in a sense. If it starts well... obviously they won't have had time to fully develop the story... but if they have the makings of a story and questions crop up, if you can explore that and have a working session... Yes, we can help direct their thinking and give them some advice. It's not a question of penalizing them for what they say. It's more a question of exploring how it flows, how it works and how they react to your input. First of all, what is the theme? The theme, yes. - We know you're Thomas. - I am indeed. That's me. Enjoy the end of a 2013/2014 season full of surprises. - Enjoy? - Enjoy One day a couple of seemingly honest tourists, two decent people hiking in the mountains of the Ardèche, ask if they can come and stay with him for a few nights. Naturally, he agrees. But what Raymond doesn't know is that this couple... are religious fanatics who are traveling all over France and Europe in an attempt to "purify" it, to use their expression. And so they are... She professes to be acting on the Lord's behalf and her husband believes her. And they use that as an excuse to commit murders and to get rid of anyone who doesn't comply with their version of Christianity. Realistically, is it credible, that these two tourists show up at Ray's place, and then murder multiple people? And they are these fanatics... I'm sorry, but she mentioned the tone. These characters seem to be caricatures. They are caricatures, but on the other hand, in my defense... - I'm not on the attack. - No. It's true, they do sound like caricatures but the story is based on real-life events. I spend my holidays in Le Cheylard and two fanatical tourists killed a child in Lyon a few years ago. They were staying in a gîte next-door to my grandmother's house. They were staying there, these two murderers, hiking from village to village with their dog. - And you saw them? - Yes, I saw them there. - So the story... - What were they like? The sort of people you see all the time in Ardèche. Lots of Belgian tourists go hiking in the mountains there. They were staying next-door and they had killed a boy of 11. The story caused quite a stir that summer. He was stabbed. And the plot thickens because it was my cousin who denounced them. They were on TV so we saw their faces. And he said, "Those are the guys I just saw on the bridge. It's them." And that's how they got arrested. He's very immature so there's a lack of depth. But there's a real sense of narrative in the way he... I even wondered whether he'd prepared it and written it down. Because it had so little to do with the subject? - You mean... - There was a lot of hype and hearsay. So whatever subject he had picked, he would have applied it to his Michal? - His what? - Cheylard. - Cheylard. - Oh, yes, Cheylard. It lacked depth and credibility. He didn't express himself very well. Hello, for the garbage? - Shall we go get her? - Yes, I'll go get her. - You can come in now. - Right. - "We have the whole night ahead of us." - "We have the whole night ahead of us." "We have the whole night ahead of us. The photos can wait.” Close quotation there. Then, "The car drives slowly along the Quai de Montebello." Start whenever you like. So it starts in a big house, which is quite modern, with a girl called Joséphine whom everybody calls Jo. How old is Jo? She's 16. It's her 16th birthday. Her father hangs up on her. He's a handsome older man sitting in the back of a big black luxury car with a beautiful woman lying beside him. And... He strokes her hair, saying they have the whole night ahead of them and they can take the photos later. The photos they've taken that day are almost enough. They only need a couple more, that's all. The woman asks who was on the phone. He replies that it was his daughter. She replies that he should go home. He says there's no point because it's her birthday and at 16 you'd rather be with your friends than your dad. She wants to tell her father to look after her but she can't find the words to say that because it's very hard to ask to be loved when you're 16. And I think she hates photography because she feels as if it's taking her father away from her because her father's art is more important to him than his daughter. So she's nothing apart from how absent her father is? And if she was a little more there, with her three friends? At the end, she's able to be there, with Quentin. I think there is something else going on here. Perhaps I expressed it badly. Her rejection of Quentin's kiss is pretty violent. There's something... If her dad had spoken to her on the phone, would she have let Quentin kiss her? I don't think so but she wouldn't have been in such a rage. She would have been gentler in her rejection of him, I think. I don't know whether she can let Quentin kiss her, in the sense that... Because, as you say, it's not such a big deal. It's her party. You said they were smoking joints. The atmosphere is conducive to a kiss, so to speak. Yes. She's touching. Well, there's a lot of good stuff there, nothing particularly surprising? There's a lot that's good. - She's very level-headed. - Yes. So Mathias' mother was Pierre's mistress? - Or not? - Pierre had a wife called Isabelle, who was Mathias' mother. And Émile's wife... Pierre... She went on to become Émile's wife. Pierre had this wife called Isabelle and one day Émile stole his wife from him. So she went off with him for no reason. - When she was... - I'm sorry but I need a recap. - Can you give us all the characters' names?? - Yes, apologies? Émile was the 60-year-old filmmaker who got killed. And he's Mathias' father? Right. His son, Mathias, happens to be investigating the murder. He finds a family of three in the house next-door and they are Pierre, the master of the house, his wife, Clara... Oh, yes, sorry. I said Isabelle. - I apologize. I got that wrong. - Don't worry about it. And their son Jonathan who doesn't know that Clara isn't his mother. So Clara was... I'm sorry. I'm getting confused. Clara is Pierre's new wife and the former... Émile had a wife who died who was called Isabelle and his wife Isabelle was Jonathan's mother. - So... - And Mathias's. And... Right. That's why they're half-brothers. So he was in love with the wife in the house next-door? - With Pierre's ex-wife. - His ex-wife, who was... No, he ran off with Pierre's first wife. And she became his wife and the mother of his son. - Yes, she became his wife. - Is she Mathias' mother? - Yes. - Isabelle was Mathias' mother. - Isabelle who died? - There was only one mother. So he rings the doorbell of the guy's house whose wife he stole, saying, "I'm making a documentary about the region and the locals?" He ran off with his wife and had a child with her. So Pierre's wife. - Yes. - And he went there to film the guy. But he didn't recognize him. They'd met in the past. but they'd forgotten. Meanwhile, in Pierre's house... There is a photo of Pierre with the woman he really loved before his current wife. - All covered in dust... - Clara. - All covered in dust. - They'd been in the house for a year. I think it's very good. So it's, "She said to me, as normal as can be, "Quote, 'I am a horse.'" - "She said to me..." - "...as normal as can be," "Quote, 'I am a horse.'" So he leaves. He leaves the party. He goes back to his training camp, to his stable. It's late. Camille comes, it's nighttime. She apologizes for what's happened. She didn't intend for things to turn out like that. He's touched, but it doesn't feel right, and he says, "I only relax when I'm with the horses." "They're not criticizing my social behavior, I mean, I'm only relaxed with them." He tells Camille she wouldn't understand. She replies, as if it was perfectly normal, "But 'I am a horse.'" She starts talking about her own passion for horses. She says to him, "I'm just like you." "I can't talk to my friends. They're all so bourgeois.” This is what I like. So, Camille, the bourgeois equestrian and he's falling in love with her. And she's drawn to him. She ends up liking Paul too. And he asks her a question, or something, and she replies, "But I'm a horse." I think you introduced that at exactly the right moment. I thought that was great. But, who is this person? Later she comes round to the idea... We see her with Octave and we're disappointed by the girl who said, "But I am a horse." That's what he needed to hear. - He needed to hear that line. - Right. It's the best thing she could possibly have said to him. And yet we're disappointed to find her in Octave's arms after school. She's becoming an adult. She's a girl who's growing up. And he never really manages to grow up. He's stuck in between as she's growing out of it. I don't mean that in a positive or negative way but she's growing into something bourgeois her friends are talking about becoming doctors or whatever, and she says to herself, I need to get serious. And in the end she goes back to her roots, to what her parents had in mind for her, and she doesn't escape her background. He met her, I think, just at the time when she was between two worlds, full of possibilities. Yes, it's interesting, the fact that he met her just at the right time. I agree with Jérôme that "I am a horse" came at just the right moment. However, you say that she carries on and says, "I love horses. They are my world too." That's not the same as saying, "I am a horse." What happens next is disappointing compared to the ambition of, "I am a horse." She falls back on, "I like horses." Or even, "I love horses." Or, "Horses are my passion." That's not the same as saying, "I am a horse." - 7, 5, 5. - Yes. - 13, 14, 14. - Yes. - 16, 17, 17. - Yes. - 14, 16, 16. - Yes. - 7, 6, 6. - Yes. - 9, 8, 8. - Yes. - 13, 12, 12. - Yes. - 14, 13, 14. - That makes a change. Yes. - 13, 14, 13. - Yes. - 13, 13, 13. - Yes. I love doing this. I wish it went on for 40 pages. It's exhilarating. I'll hand that in, then. Right? These are perspectives of India, seen from different angles, with all these barrages you have to cross to get to... But India is densely populated. There aren't many people here. That's true. This is really... If you don't mind, I'd like to go back to the storm and the bit with all those little portholes. Yes. The line was, "The ship sank in a storm and only Eloïse escaped." But Eloïse is nowhere to be seen. That's true. I was really looking at the spaces. I chose not to put characters in those spaces so I could open up my own perspective. Actually, let me turn it around. I imagined this long, narrow garden the sultan is up here, open sky above him, emphasizing this idea of a wide open space. But then it turns out? It turns out, there's this whole movement in the story, which shows the protagonists heading for the pagoda, toward the most intimate space. The farther they go, the lower and darker it gets, there's a progression that matches their situation. They go down a step, they get closer together. And at the entrance to the maze I imagine Éloïse walking in front and the sultan walking behind her. I thought about it afterwards and that evening I thought, The maze should be circular. I realized it was more interesting for the sultan to be watching Éloïse gradually disappear, to have him follow her, lose her, catch up again? you're following a character. She interpreted the film set as if it was just scenery, so not a space where action unfolds. She touches on that but it wasn't her priority. She's got a point of view and a vision. She talks about the space and them losing one another in the maze. It's true that building a circular maze would give a sense of infinity and make it easier to lose one another on their way to this confined space in which they're destined to meet. She articulates it but it isn't a priority and I think that's missing the point. And yet the cinematic vision is there. - It's a project. - It is a project for a film but that didn't come across in her presentation to us. She's one of the few to have drawn the overall picture, - showing characters' positions. - In relation to one another. Most candidates have given us a series of isolated scenes, one after the other. So that was interesting. Technical rendering. - That wasn't bad. - True. 8. There was no research into the materials to speak of. There were images of materials but no materials. No. No, but in her file there was this parallel construction. Interestingly, she was the only one to have imagined the architectural links between India and France... - The principle was clever. - That was really well done. - But it was almost too much. - Yes, once again... We can't say it was too much. - As for motivation... - She's motivated. - Yes, but not as much as... - Not as much as some of the others. - I haven't given her full credit. - Me neither. - No, definitely not as much. - Lower than average but still very good. - I did give her full credit. - You gave her full credit? I did, but you're right, she's no comparison with the other one. I'd better lower it. There wasn't much in her project. - I put 60. - We're really very close, then. - I'm off by 3. - What did you put? 63. - Okay, close enough then. - Yes. Good. We're good at this! The idea is, throughout the scene, we never see your whole face. Okay. The idea is that he doesn't know you any more. He no longer sees the woman he loved. So we won't see your face. Also you're searching for your identity so your memories come back to you gradually. Can we turn out the main light? - Right, okay. - To leave us with the light from outside. I'll turn it away so you get an idea, because without the HMI? That's not what she said. - Actually, I meant that light there. - Oh, sorry. It's because the last one asked for this. I apologize. This is even simpler. Yes, okay. I find it strange that she didn't... It's always the same if you don't listen to the whole scene. I think so, but anyway... Are we rolling? No one told you I have amnesia? We were a good match. What was I like? The overall theme is there. She said she'd show the rekindled passion and she has. The others didn't do what they said they'd do, apart from the first candidate this morning. Where shall I go? I think you could go out... There's that there, but... In the clouds? Clouds... We'll try to break up the clouds. This is pretty good actually. I'll do what you ask. I can just look at him, or even turn my head... No, look at him when he says, "Have you met many?" Look at him first, but once you've said no, turn away. - Okay. - Turn towards the back. Okay. Shall we go over it once? Let's do it. Go on. Have you met many? No, only you, and I'm not attracted to you at all. He did that well. - I was falling asleep. - Really? I thought he was quite good. - I felt he was... - He seemed to understand the scene. He explained it well. Yes, but the humor in the scene has been lost. From close up they look as if they're freaking out. And I definitely feel... I'm not saying this to defend them, but they seem febrile to me. And so this reflex, for example, of being a bit arrogant at times, I sense that that's... Yes, but we've all been through exams. We know how bad these situations are. Yes, but it is a competition after all and others are dealing with it better. Why don't you commit suicide? Well... because I've tried before and failed. - Unlucky. - On the contrary, I was lucky. - Otherwise I wouldn't be alive. - I thought you didn't want to be. - No! - You said you wanted to die. Only because I'm unhappy and suffering, but I want to go on suffering because I want to go on loving her. Oh, right. Cut. - Is the camera on? - Action. No. I mean, I'm unhappy and I'm suffering, but I want to keep on suffering because I want to keep on loving her. - That's hard. - Cut. What I really like is getting at who a particular person is, and playing with the details. For example? Let me think. Oh, yes, I really liked “Modern Life” by Depardon. It's representative of the sort of documentary I'd like to make. I like to find profiles and then go see what's happening, etc... It's almost? it's not mean-spirited, exactly, but it's like you're peeping through the keyhole to see what's going on. But that's what I like about it, taking a step back and letting it all happen, without... I don't want to be completely out of the picture. I don't want it to be an entirely objective report. I want to be involved. But I also want things to unfold naturally. And that's what I would have... If I could do it again, I'd film the scene from earlier like that. I'd let things unfold and take some wide-angled shots. Some truth about him came across. I don't know how. Do you agree? Yes, you expressed it quite well. It's as if you were saying, when you talked about documentaries, "I just want to be able to create the circumstances," And actors work with circumstances, Do you see? So, your accent, are you from the south? Yes, I'm from Narbonne. I'm studying in Avignon. I've come to take the entrance exams for La Fémis because I'm doing cinema studies. Narbonne's near Perpignan, isn't it? It's a bit closer than Perpignan. - It's two hours from Avignon by train. - Right. My first real cinema experience was as a freshman, at a workshop being held at the youth center I went to. It was actually a screenwriting workshop. And we went on to make a short film. Actually, it wasn't really a short film. It was a photomontage. We took photos and edited them. And that was the first time I'd come up against the challenges of directing and how to set up a shot, even just to take photographs. Even just doing that was complicated. Creating drama and tension and framing shots was something I really enjoyed. She's genuine and she's keen. I think she's great. And she hasn't been brainwashed to speak in elaborate sentences, - She expresses things simply. - She's not Fémis-trained. Fucking cool. But she is in prep school. - She's got the training on paper. - Were we seduced by her accent? No, not just that. - No, the things she said, the stories. - She's eloquent about what she likes. What she said about documentaries was great. She gave us her own point of view, not something she'd read in a book. She has it, she didn't learn it from the entrance-exam prep guide. - And it worked. Vincent was good. - Absolutely. And she was right to use that awful set for that script? Her set made a nice change from the red sofa. Yes, it was almost burlesque. No, she was doing her thing completely. I think it's a weakness I have. I must admit, sometimes when I'm editing I am forced to... patch things up because I've cut a bit too soon. That's what's known as shooting yourself in the foot. Do you see? By cutting every shot too soon you end up with no material, and filmmaking requires material. You need to believe in the shot so that it can come alive. When did you develop a desire to make films? When I was in Côte d'Ivoire. I was born in France in Montpellier but at the age of ten I went to live in Côte d'Ivoire and there was a war on in Côte d'Ivoire. My father is a politician. I used to go with him to help him campaign in the villages and I liked to film what was happening. Then, when I came back to France, I realized there was a lot of disinformation about events there so I wanted to communicate and share what I'd seen. I also realized that images can be used to make people believe anything. That made me want to express myself through films. Do you want to go into politics? My father would like me to go into politics. I wanted to be a lawyer. But no, because it's too corrupt. It's rotten to the core. You can't change the world by being a politician. But I think that, if you try hard enough, you can change the world and people's minds with films because it's easier to get your ideas across. I think people tend to pay more attention to images. The cinema is more effective at conveying ideas than politicians... however smooth-talking they are. - Are your parents in Côte d'Ivoire? - My parents were in Côte d'Ivoire. Four years ago my father became a political refugee in Ghana. So, he is in Ghana and my mother returned to Montpellier. - Do you have brothers and sisters? - A big sister, yes. - She's ten years older than me. - Does she work? No, she doesn't work but she gets by somehow. She lives from hand to mouth. - Where? In Montpellier? - No, she was in London recently. She's back in Paris but she's only been back two weeks and I think she'll head off somewhere else. How does she get by in London? It's one of the most expensive cities. - Let's just say... - It's true. No, but... Yes, I can tell you. She lives with people. She's not a gigolo, but she is a bit. So there you have it. But as for that... Which films have made an impression on you? Or quite simply, which films do you like? Films I like... That you've liked since you were 15. There are lots. - French or...? - Any. - Not a film... - Never mind who made it. - What genre I like? - No, what films. Films that have made an impression on you. Something that makes you say, "You should see that, it's fantastic." I was so lost in my thoughts that? Sorry. Which films? I can't even remember the last film I saw. Which films? I wanted her to say something, but nothing! She couldn't think of one film, not a single one. - No, not one. - Not even one. It could have been anything. Even "Titanic". No, but I mean, the rushes are garbage. I mean, you say I went after him, but it's messed up! It's because you don't like him. No, no, it's true, I disliked him right away. I saw the rushes and heard him masturbating over them. with Robert Bresson's notes on cinematography in his hand, I mean, reading them one after the other, and I thought, "Spare us! Don't come to La Fémis, get a life!" That's not true. Yes it is. You just can't stand him, that's all. Justify it all you want. - His work showed real skill. - It was garbage. That's not true and I know you know it's not true. He wanted to put the guy in blue makeup to make him a zombie? Yes, he wanted to use blue makeup. He didn't have makeup so he used blue light. I don't know how to grade the ones in the middle, how to decide whether one is better than another. Yes, that is very hard. I'm hoping we'll all agree that they're so average that... What would be great is if the famous "top 15" really stood out as exceptional? With, say, 7 boys, 8 girls. That would be great. - An Asian, a black. - Yes. - An Arab. - Yes. That would be good. Well, let's find a way. And from all over the country. - Not just Paris. - With an accent. And, to make Patricia and Sylvie happy, some poor kids. Did you get the feeling I did, that it was easier to choose candidates in the studio than in the interview? - No, I felt the opposite. - You felt the opposite. For me it depends. It really depends. Some of them stood out during the shoot but with others it feels like the personality, how they'll fit in here, shone through more in the interview. And you see the rushes in the interview. The interview is really useful. I think it's easier to make something up in the interview than on set. - If you're making it up. - That girl wasn't making it up. She wasn't good in the interview. Now I remember it. She really wasn't good, she didn't say all the right things. Lots of candidates were very good in the interview. Yes, she has no experience. She went to art school. - She's never been on a set before. - She didn't know. She wasn't at all comfortable in the interview. Okay. It's true, on the other hand, when I say I find it easier to see them on set Is that I forget they can get so panicked that they screw it up. They screw it up because of the sequence, because of the actors, because of the panic. Whereas in other respects they might be good. Melchior, technically speaking, was very good. - Melchior can set up a shot. - The Beaux-Arts graduate you hated. But you agree that he can set up a shot? - Do you agree? - No. - No? - No. - Otherwise I'd give him higher grades. - But the shot, when he's out in the hallway, and the camera - for once! - isn't facing the sofa, wide shot, - but it's out in the hallway... - High angle... With those horrid curtains and that shitty light. There are three shots so it's easy to pick them out. - Yes, but... - The first one, first off, was filmmaking. The first one was good. - And so was the last one. - So was the last one. - It was. - It was. There was something there. Shoot three takes that all work, in one hour? I'm not sure I'd know how to do that in an hour. The first one was real filmmaking. That's pretty rare because we had a lot... It's a really big deal! - I got three losers. - Three great shots. They were really well set up and they gave the scene meaning. But remember the second shot? You remember? It was so bad I could lay it out for you, I remember, it was garbage! Show me his shot, then. - All right. - Go on, you're better than me. I don't agree. I didn't think it was crap. Nor did I. I'm sure he drove you nuts. The one thing I worry about with this guy is, what kind of mess are we getting La Fémis into handing them a total nutcase like that. - He'd drive them nuts. - I'm sorry but that's not his shot. In his shot behind the set there was a door. He even justified it to us. - That's the second shot. - Yes, the second shot. There's the screen and the girl. I'll draw his second shot for you. There's a chair there, and the guy comes in like this. That's not his second shot. It's this. Look. This is the frame. This is backdrop, with the door. There, backdrop. There, part of that horrid screen. Here, the girl. You just see her nose poking out from behind the screen. - Yes, you did see her face. - It was really interesting! She moved during the shot, and she was the only one. We sat through 600 bad attempts at the blow to the back of the neck... - Yes, yes. - Where they all fell like puppets. He's the only one who got that knockout right. Apart from all that, if he goes through to the third round, I don't know who will be on the panel in the third round, but I certainly won't be giving him more than a 3. What annoys me is, he might be the only one where I wonder, we're about to drop a guy... We might be rejecting a Cronenberg. Imagine Cronenberg at 18. You wouldn't say to him... He must have been pretty crazy himself. I'm not saying this guy is Cronenberg. I'm saying, just because he's crazy... Dreyer wouldn't exactly have been full of the joys of life in an interview. It's quite possible that he was insufferable. At any rate, on set, everyone was engrossed. It bothers me, making him pay for his craziness. There are plenty of crazy directors. Agreed, he's not a guy I want to get into conversation with. He comes here and I run into him, I'll run away. - But at least he'll be here. - Was he unpleasant? Insane. You ask him to pass the salt, he talks your ear off for the next 20 minutes. But that doesn't mean he can't direct. Being crazy doesn't stop you being a great director. I just don't want us to stop a guy from doing what he needs to do, if that's going to La Fémis, just because he's crazy. - It's not because he's crazy... - He's talented and crazy. It's a profession that requires you to know how to communicate. You're just giving one opinion of what a director should be like. - I'm not. - You are. You're saying a director has to be able to communicate. Look at the director of "Drive". Seriously, you should see the director of “Drive”. He can't communicate. If you watch a documentary on him, he's completely insane and yet he's a genius if you look at his film. - He's a true director. - He's a genius. If you see him with his crew he's a raving lunatic. He doesn't open his mouth, he's off in a corner. His wife barely knows how to talk to him. He goes toy shopping while everyone is on set. I'm afraid of our screwing this up by deciding that we don't like him, so we cross him off the list. Those rejections worry me. At the end of the day we're saying, "They're in because I like them." Hello, La Fémis. Yes. Which department did you apply for? Set design. And what's your name? No, I don't see you. Okay, you're welcome. Goodbye. In school, some will have learned to speak with much greater ease. Often, someone who has gone to a school like Sciences Po knows what to say. You should be careful with that. Someone who is relaxed and can construct an argument isn't necessarily... It's important to pay attention to what's behind it. Students from other universities are generally less experienced in oral exams. So you need to keep things like that at the back of your mind so that you can try to understand the real intentions, what they're after? I'm Thomas Ordonneau. I run a distribution and production company called Shellac founded ten years ago, mostly to develop first films. That's it. I'm Marie Christine Desandré. I manage an independent cinema company and I have cinemas in the provinces. I'm Thomas Vigneau and for the last 12 years I've run a film promotion company that works with producers and distributors, prior to which, in the 90s, I spent five years at BAC Film. In marketing. Arnaud Surel. I work for Gaumont Pathé Cinemas. I've run various cinemas in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Paris. I recently opened Pathé Beaugrenelle Cinema in the 15th arrondissement. How did you learn to love cinema? Do you remember? I know my first encounter and first choice as a child was “The Young Girls Of Rochefort”. That will always be my number one, I know it by heart. You're wearing the colors now! Yes, that hasn't changed! Even as a child I found it beautiful and my dream was to be Françoise Dorléac and to speak just like her, with her voice. Why have you chosen distribution over production or cinema management? It just came to me one day. I knew that what I wanted to do was show films and bring in audiences. The further I went in school, the more I realized that before doing that I would need to throw myself into one film and stay with it from its production to its release to learn how to get people to see a film I believed in and had chosen to take under my wing, so to speak. I know I may end up wanting something else, but that's where I am at the moment. - So you only take three students, right? - In distribution, yes. And that doesn't change? It's set? - It's non-negotiable. - It's the law! Well, have a good day and good luck for tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Goodbye. - She was a breath of fresh air. - The polar opposite of the last one. Worlds apart. - I like the dramatic reversals. - We could make a play out of it! She's straight out of "La Fille du 14 Juillet". Seriously. Beyond that, I don't know. What did you think? - She was a little young, in the sense that? - Yes, young, but passionate about cinema. - She was full of energy. - I like that. It made me want to help her put it to work. She said she put people in a good mood, and I saw her putting us in a good mood. What really surprises me is how far she outshined the one before, who appeared much more solid but I thought she outshined him completely. She has greater potential. All his potential was already... All his potential was already there and it really didn't feel like there is much more to expect, while she really has something developing, there are real possibilities there. I liked the fact that he saw distribution as sharing something with the audience. He was the first to say that. Maybe it's just a detail, depending how? But I really liked that particular remark. Besides that, he came to promote himself. He's got more experience. He's 27, he knows what works, he obviously wants to come here. He's applied three times. I thought he made a good argument. He spoke a lot about the fact that he's a juror at Cannes. He reviews films, he's even chosen some? - That's really all he talked about. - That proves... - He didn't mention La Fémis once. - He's applied three times. Anyway. Everyone has the right to an opinion. Personally, I thought he was good. He's my number three for the time being. He's the third. Let's see the next one. I thought he was good. But of course that's just my choice. I chose programming and distribution. Two cinema managers from a cinema in Villefranche-sur-Saône came to teach us. They showed us the accounting to give us an idea and... I found it funny. I don't know, all those figures... made me want... I want to learn all that. No, it doesn't scare me. I have one question about the Méliès in Saint-Étienne. Who's the boss? Sylvain Pichon. Did you know that in fact the theater was recently put up for sale? and Sylvain didn't buy it, one of the projectionists did? One of the projectionists took out a loan and bought the theater and officially runs it now. Sylvain is in charge of programming but he's an employee. Which of those roles would you hope to play in your career someday? Would you be the one who invests, taking on the debt and running the theater, or would you prefer just a job taking care of artistic direction, without the entire financial responsibility for the theater? I see myself more as an employee, not exactly dependent on someone, but having someone else there... No, I don't see myself in charge of the whole thing, at the very top. Maybe that's not? But anyway. - Okay. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Have a good day. Thank you. That's an employee of a company. That's what I was thinking. She's looking for a job as a theater manager. She doesn't have the mindset to run a theater. She doesn't want the commitment. Well, she did just turn 22. - Yes, but she has to think about the fact that? - Yes, but... - I saw her as much more of a realist. - Absolutely. You need to be a realist to run a cinema. But that's not... I mean... She doesn't want to. She said so. Let's not cause her pain. She doesn't want to! In sixth grade we saw “The 400 Blows” by Truffaut, and that was a huge film moment for me. Next we saw a film by Takahata. We went to the movies often and I loved being in the audience. I discovered that the moment when the lights go down and everyone vanishes and you're alone in front of the screen, it was really emotional for me. I knew I loved it, but why did I love it? That's when I started taking a real interest in film, and I discovered that there were lots of different jobs there, so I did a baccalauréat in film studies which was pretty hands-on. So I thought, "I'll be a director, that's the thing!" I made a film for my exam. I enjoyed it but I thought, "That's not it." And from the courses I did as a first-year at Millau and afterwards I realized that what I missed was the audience's reaction and being the final link in the chain, the one negotiating with the distributor, the one negotiating to have one film or another... So I realized this was the job for me, at the end of a very long chain. It gives people so much pleasure because it has educational value but it's also entertainment. There's the pleasure of seeing people happy, which isn't always the case, so that's why... Can we go back to Mister Schultz? - I couldn't resist. - Of course. He said to you, "This cinema is my house, the café is my dining room," "the projection room is my office and the auditorium is my bedroom." And you say, "This incredible metaphor" "seems like my life goal," "what I dreamed of then, and still dream of now." Yes, that's It. There wasn't much space to express myself. - No, but still... - He was an amazing man. He was passionate about the cinema. He was 65 and he'd started at 18. He introduced me to this magical world. I was no longer in the auditorium. I was with him, showing films. We chose the program together. What time, what day, and so on. To explain the bedroom idea, it was still 35mm at the time and one of the theaters was rear-projection. It was big enough that you could unwind an entire reel. He had set up a deck chair back there, so he wasn't in the auditorium, he was on his deck chair watching the film from behind, and he said, "This is my bedroom." Obviously I had some great times in that theater. Theater management has a future! Yes, there was a lot of... What did you think? I thought she was great. Seriously. Yes, me too. She loves it. The passion is palpable, and she's not afraid, either. She talked about managing single-screen theaters, adding a second screen? She's not scared. Perhaps she doesn't completely understand the economic reality, but that doesn't matter because she's ready to fight, she has ideas? She's alive. We discussed that earlier. But is she too nice? I think, she even said, she might be a little too, "Everything's beautiful?" But perhaps we need people like that in these difficult times. Yes, and she didn't say it to please us. She said it because that's who she is. That's her temperament and it's a good thing. - Hello. - Hello. We'll introduce ourselves, and then you can tell us why and how you've come to be here, etc. Let's start with Christel. My name is Christel Dewynter. I am an editor. Emmanuel Chaumet. I'm a film producer. Solange Zeitoun, set designer. Olivier Ducastel, director, and Co-Director of the Directing Department. Laetitia Masson, director. Cyril Holtz. I do sound mixing. Pascale Granel, director of photography. I'd like to jump right in talking about ghosts. What do you have to offer a world of ghosts? - Is there a particular ghost... - A favorite ghost? Yes, a two-point-zero, are you reinventing the ghost? I don't know if I'm reinventing them but they resonate with me. I think it's important to talk about time, and when I was young I liked things like “Tales from the Crypt” or “Beetlejuice”. At first I really liked creating special effects, and inventing ways of getting inanimate objects to move, the microphone or whatever. After looking into it, I realized it was possible to create something that had never existed. At least to my eyes. I can't actually make things move. I'm sorry I'm so flushed. I'm a bit hot. - May I? - Of course. Go ahead. Stop-motion was a transitional phase. I don't think I'll do any more stop-motion, but it taught me how to create special effects, minor special effects. It was around that time that I got to know Jean Cocteau, his films I mean. - Speaking of ghosts. - Exactly. I was really affected by those gloves moving on their own. When I was 15 I didn't understand the poetry or the subversiveness, but the graphic work affected me right away. When I watch a film I don't necessarily want to see what I already know because I see that every day on the subway. When I watch a film which offers me something new, it's inspiring. It's living vicariously, it's a discovery. Preparing for this I watched war films, even if it's not my thing, so here I am going "Rah rah!" It's inspiring. I dreamed about this scene while doing the dishes and such, I think it's important if I want to become a director to be able to breathe life into my ghosts. That's what I enjoy. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What a character! - He's a cool guy. - Very cool. - I'm fascinated with? - With ghosts? - No, with them. - With boys in plaid shirts? No, I put myself in their shoes, I try to help them, give them a last chance, another, a way in? a way to turn into something, it's not hard for me at all. The only time he let go, and I wrote it down, was at the end when he said, "I know we'll be making documentaries in the second year." That was touching because he really seemed to believe in it. While the rest of the time he came off as such a dilettante I didn't think he was a dilettante. When he talked about film it was so self-referential. When he said it helped him... not exactly that it helped him live... but he was living vicariously through it? Watching war films to get pumped up for this? it's a really strange thing? There are people fighting wars right now so there's nothing funny in saying, "I watch war films." I felt he was completely out of touch with reality. - It's naive. - It's incredibly naive. He doesn't seem to be at all open to the world. I'm afraid it leads to movies that look like movies that look like movies, that are useless, period. I'm afraid of what's down there. It says on your CV that you studied law. You spent three years in this... detour. Why did you spend three years studying law? Well, after... As you've no doubt read, my father works in meat production, and my mother is a lawyer specializing in family law. So, for us the movies was always the red carpet at Cannes, the Césars... Something that wasn't really for us. So after high school, without thinking about it much, I applied to study law and got in. And one night, it was December of my first year, I imagined myself, ten years later, and the only place I saw myself was on set, working on a project, writing? No lawyer anywhere. So that was a revelation to me. But I wanted... since my law degree was going really well, I decided to finish it before changing course, so that I had something to show for my studies before going on to devote myself to my passion. When you say that one topic that interests you is relationships, have you written a screenplay that tells that story? Could you briefly tell us the story? The story I came up with for the synopsis, which I then rewrote, was the story of a couple, a young couple in their 30s who are very much in love and have built a life together. But then she gets raped and that upends their lives. And then she's pregnant from the rape, and ends up wanting to keep the baby. And it's about how the couple? He can't really? We get both points of view. They disagree so it's about where things go from there. That's what I like best. And where do you fit into this story? Well, this past year, with respect to babies, my sister lost a baby in her fifth month. So it was personal. I had never thought... I saw it as a miscarriage, not something dramatic, but last year, living through it with my sister so this woman wanting to keep her baby is something I can understand now when I might not have before. What I heard him saying was that his application was a kind of coming out. - Exactly. - Not gay, but coming out to his family. He told us they weren't filmgoers. So to decide that he wants to be a director, that he wants to "become an artist", must have been messy for him. So maybe another year of ESRA, a little more experience, and we'll see what we're not seeing yet. Does he have something unique to say? I don't know, I think what brought him here is what you're describing. He's found himself, he's realized he's not a lawyer, and he won't be coming to Jesus... No, really... and he's ready to follow his passion, but what will he do with it? - He's 22. - Yes. - You're saying he's old or he's young? - He's old! For a Catholic school boy? You've got to be kidding. I was on the train and I could see the Vosges, because I went to art college in Épinal and then Metz. And from the train the mountains were... kind of orange, red, it was evening, and it was odd, suddenly Planet Earth looked just like Mars. And I thought, "Amazing, I discovered Mars!" So there you have it. It was interesting because it wasn't just about changing color turning Earth into Mars. It was that things could be so foreign in spite of resembling Earth so closely. When you bring up the blank page and your anxiety over it? Every screenplay starts as a blank page. Of course. That's why it's so difficult. And in the studio you have the same "blank page" problem. I think there are many points in the making of a film, like when you first step onto an empty set. There are lots of moments when you face total blankness. Even once the set is in place, and you send actors to their places, before you start there's a moment of total blankness. Yes, and that's precisely the reason I always go to the location before filming. Once I've had the chance to observe... You can't just start making a movie, it's very complicated. You have to go back more than once, spend a lot of time there, to really see what's interesting about it. And it's about the story. It's not a bunch of nice shots. What's going to happen in these bushes? I found these fantastic bushes! But that doesn't make a film. It makes an interesting set of photos. But there's no narrative, there's no story. So perhaps the character in my film, just as I did, is going to discover these bushes, and go inside. And perhaps he's amazed at the size, He suddenly feels really small and these branches, usually so small, grow huge. - Hopeless. - I liked him. But I don't think, here anyway? - No, really? - I couldn't take another second. Me neither. Sorry, that was painful. He's in the wrong place. He's looking for something that can't be found in the real world of traditional cinema. - No but honestly, you can tell he? - He's autistic. He finds being a student reassuring. He, he needs to cut loose and do something. If not he's going to spend his life as a student and I think that's terrifying. Obviously I'm flash-forwarding here, but seeing him here for four years? Today young people's lives are full of trivialities. Our lives... Baricco, an Italian writer, talks about the experience of surfing. I don't know if that makes sense to you. We're surfing our own lives. Before, intellectuals, people, got at the heart of things. Today, we just have impressions, that we take in and give back. I think that's what's going on. Now we have to find the courage to take a stand on nothing, to start with the ephemeral, in order to say something less ephemeral. At the end of your essay you say, "God is in things." Yes. That's a beautiful sentence. Then you talk about the sacrifice of the fishermen and how they manage to survive. So I have two questions. If God is in things, maybe he's in film, I don't know? And what is that on the table? I'll start with the first one. God is in things because if we stop to look at one part of his palette, and we are able to see the detail, the beauty of these simple things, then we are able to see God. I think about the fishermen. If a fisherman can talk to me the way some of them did, it means he's seen God. He might not have made the pilgrimage to Santiago. Maybe he doesn't have a ticket to India. He has seen God in his own real life. He has fought the sea, he has given his life, so he can eat. And in that struggle he has seen God. I think that in the cinema there are films which show a character's epiphany as they get a glimpse of the divine, of God - call it what you will, we each have our own name for it. Do you think God is in films? Sometimes. It depends on the film. We only have a minute left, so the question about... This is a miniature creel. It's a lucky charm Sicilian fishermen carry, in their cars or their homes. There's a photo of it in my application. When I was talking to Mister Giuseppe... we talked for three hours, sitting on the beach next to his boat It was a wonderful experience and afterwards I asked him to talk about his life and himself. And he said, "Come with me." He took me to his house and asked his wife to bring this downstairs. It's a lucky charm. The Sicilian fishermen are in here. I wanted to show my gratitude by bringing them with me. I found him intelligent, sensitive, thoughtful. I agree, more or less. He seemed to live through his own desire. I was worried about... When he started his spiel at the end... I'm really wary of people who try to come off too well. His application was showing off a little. True, some filmmakers show off and are also talented? I don't understand your concern about a lack of authenticity. Are you worried he won't see his studies through? No, but with certain films you sense that you're being taken for a ride. Do you know what I mean? Films which seem to be all show. Maybe showing off is part of how he plays it. He is Italian? At the same time this is a guy who knows how it works... Which is not a bad thing for a director. That's what I'm saying. He fits the profile of a director. Not to worry, He'll make movies and be successful. If you don't get in will you try again next year? Yes, definitely. If I don't get in I'll finish my degree at the École du Louvre. I've still got the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries to cover, African art, a shit-ton of stuff. And then we'll see. But next year I'll be fired up. No more whining, get a grip and get on with it. Enough already! In your application you talk about the films I'd guess you want to produce, you talk about "bold and innovative" films. What makes a film "bold and innovative"? Right now I'm a student, producing a lot of... I try to produce short films. using equipment I've gotten, and I'm always pushing... I think we need to put producers, screenwriters, directors, at the heart of the process. Today it's the distributors in control, not the auteurs. In all the short films I produce, I push young directors and writers to take risks. I was a bartender before I went back to school, I think that's what's made me who I am today. I've learned a lot about myself and I keep a foot in that door, I'm loyal to that world. Those were the people who gave me a break when I came to Paris and they supported me and such. Also, being a bartender reminds me why I want to do this. I did a season in Saint Tropez. I was at the Hôtel du Nord too. Last summer I was at the Hôtel du Nord. I worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day, and all because I was supposed to be making a film with a friend. He wasn't committed enough and chose to go out rather than dig in. So I said, "Okay, never mind. "I'm going to take my future in hand "and I'm going to work six days a week for three months. "I'm going to eat nothing but pasta. I'll put money aside." I bought a Blackmagic camera, accessories, sound equipment, I spent 12 or 13 thousand euros, I get to college in September, and I say, "I've got the equipment," "who wants to make a short film?" I got a bunch of scripts. A bunch. I read them, I picked the ones I liked, I took some of everything because... Then I said, "Work on this script. Read this and this," "Look at the technical composition and maybe work on it a little more." And off they went. Some of them never came back. Seriously. I hope they didn't run off with your equipment. No, I've still got it, not to worry. I said, "Try this, try this." "I want to see how motivated you are." When I was working in bars, when I was head bartender, in charge of recruiting, I preferred those who knew nothing, but were motivated, and really wanted it to someone blasé who had the right degree. - Solange is about to burst. - I am about to burst. It was a slave's apology, work shall make you free? Whoa whoa whoa, careful there! Oh I'm saying it. I know you're going to react because I watched you making googly-eyes at him, - but still... - Googly eyes! - It's just an expression. - Thanks for the compliment! You were like this. But I felt like he was on coke or something. Are you kidding? He wasn't on coke, he was pitching his life! - He was really intimidated. - Of course he was. I didn't get that impression at all. He's very shrewd. He was shaking like a leaf. - Emmanuel, you start. - Yes, Emmanuel, what do you think? He'll, he'll, he'll? - It will be carnage. - No. - I think so. - We need carnage. Carnage is good. He's someone fascinating, very interesting, but he scares me too because I find him... I think he's already great. Most of all, he has so much energy and ambition, a vision, he's so sure of himself, that he'll come here, and the school will turn out to be wrong for him. People coming here are blasé because they're so used to it that... But that's what I'm saying! All these people, so blasé... - He'll never fit in. - He's too military! I think he's great but I think he can do it on his own. He's so driven, he's bound to make it. No sorry, the first one, he can do it on his own, the one from Sciences Po. No the first one, he's a student, he's well-behaved, - He's intelligent. - This one's a punk. He's not a punk, he's a hick. - No, he's not. - Of course he is. - He's a hick. - He's right to push but... - Where he comes from? - I agree. - That's the entire question. - We can't be populist. It's not populism, giving a chance to people who don't come from this world! I couldn't decide during the interview. - I needed to sit with it. - Me too. Because, actually? A lot of the time I thought, someone like that would be great for the school. Of course. And him together with the guys from Sciences Po could really produce something? - Of course. - But I fear for him. I don't fear for the others but I fear for him. - What is it that you fear for him? - That he feels bad and... - That he's not in the debate. - That no one will touch him. That no director... Emmanuel said the same thing. He doesn't know how to listen. He gives orders. That's how he came across to me. Are you kidding? He's a bartender. He spends his nights listening to people. - You can't say he doesn't listen. - I've worked in a bar too. - Okay, I talked to people. - Let's look at his grades later. But look at his application project! I've lived in Paris for 20 years and for 20 years I've wondered why it's always a Tamil in the kitchen. - It is incredibly relevant! - Exactly. He'll keep going. You can't say that. We can't deny him a chance because he'll keep going! You could say that for any of them! I don't mind giving him a chance but? We said that if any of us felt strongly about anyone, we'd give them a chance. No, no, no. Hang on a minute. Let me finish. Because this one is my real favorite. Not only does the guy answer a question we've asked ourselves for 20 years but he ends by saying, “This generation of invisible men fathered a generation who live openly the life they dream of." He's talking about himself. It's autobiography. He's talking about his mother and father, about the cultural wasteland he was born into. This is his way of thanking his parents. How far he's come. You mean you checked the address on Google Maps? It's not about the address, it's about an autobiographical story. This guy was born in a desert and we have no right to say to him, “You can't come to La Fémis because you might get your feelings hurt.” - Are you okay? Are you relieved? - You bet. From that moment on you seemed more at ease. That was the trigger. I felt good when she said, "I really like it." It's a good feeling. - I'm going to see what they're up to. - Yes, of course. What was striking about everyone else in direction was that often those I found interesting were the ones watching themselves. - Right. - They were self-critical. So you're behind the candidate and they're back there too, watching themselves. I have two questions. Do you write screenplays based on your life? And, with such rich subjects and such a spectacular life, do you think you could break out of that to take on a completely different set of circumstances and, I don't know, write the character of a girl or whatever? To be honest with you, At this point I'm still just writing short stories. because when I write screenplays I sense that something's missing, that I lack the knowledge. That's why I want to come here, to gain the expertise I'm missing. And... And when I write, for the moment I really prefer fiction, prose. So what happened to suddenly make you decide that screenwriting was for you? - I apologize, I'm not good at speaking. - Have a glass of water. And take your time. There's no right or wrong answer. We're not here to trick you. It's more a question of getting to know you. Recently I went to the Cinémathèque to see the Grémillon retrospective and one of the films was "Remorques" which was co-written by Jacques Prévert. There's this point where the main characters had spent the night together, and the next day they're at the beach and they find a starfish. And she says... She's very surprised to have found a starfish. And he replies, "It must have fallen from the sky last night." It's that combination of the language of cinema and literature and poetry which I like. I want to create literature on film, so to speak. - I think he's great. - So do I. - His writing is excellent. - No point in prolonging the agony. - You just need to read it. - That's what I thought. - It's all in the writing. - That was torture for him. Never mind that he couldn't reply and that he couldn't express himself. Whatever he'd say next you were already won over, because his piece was well written and you liked it. No, he was the embodiment... - We're reading between the lines. - Well, I didn't read anything. There's something about the way people present themselves, including physically. And I think that some people write because they can't talk. End of discussion. - I'm in total agreement. - He'd said what he wanted to say. I'm surprised at the frequent lack of... The same criteria can kill one candidate but not another. There are surely inconsistencies in the arguments but that's because what we're looking for, especially in screenwriting, is so unnameable. There has to be storytelling, a richness to the work. I completely agree with you. My only worry, or rather my only reservation, on reading his file and on seeing him is maybe he's a spoiled brat. He's South American, which obviously has its appeal, and Chilean too... I'm not particularly fascinated by Chileans, no. He's not telling a spoiled brat's story. He wants to make films so he comes here and he says, "I want to make films, blah blah blah..." We'll see. It's early days. He's only the second. I think we need one like him and then we need different types. But he really has something to offer. - We can only keep six. - We keep six? This is going to be hard. One, two... - Three. - Oh, no. Sorry. That's it. - That wasn't that bad after all. - I've got my six. It's heart-breaking. Four, five... six. I want to say something, Laetitia, since we both went through it, about the experience we had the year we were on the second-round panel and we were so far off that in the final round they threw out the scores from the first two. - In screenwriting in particular? - Yes, it was for screenwriting. But for screenwriting they have a seven-hour written test. We can't decide based on the interview when the writing comes first - On their future. - And their acceptance to the school. The written test score has to count, - And so does the second-round test, really hard... - Like we did for set design. They have 45 minutes to put together the outlines of a story. That tells us something about their ability to invent quickly. Those two tests can't be thrown out for an interview result. - Absolutely. - Alas. Alas. So that's why... Let's grade them and do what you're suggesting but we need to take a second look at the files and Jean-Marc's scores. Since he said yesterday there were big discrepancies in this department, there may be some who didn't do well in the interview but who scored well on the written part, and we might have to start over. There are some we all agree on. Yes. Who are they? Mauricio, Vincent and Quentin. - It's not that we all agree, because... - Everyone has voted for them though. - They didn't get my best grades. - No, of course not. Do you want to read your scores? For example, I found Axel more interesting than those three. He was one of my personal favorites. But I'm saying that to illustrate how much we'll have to compromise. Laetitia, out of the three, two of them are my favorites. - They got the best grades I gave. - Good for you. - I think a lot of us agree. - Yes, it's consensual, it's not... - No, they're among our first choices. - It's a way of seeing what others think. If five of the six are in our top choices, that's a pretty good start, and it's not about consensus. For me a consensus means someone who... What I call a consensus is when the group thinks one thing and I don't agree but I'm not going to go against the principle which is... For me a consensus would be someone getting 13, 15, 16 across the board, - so they pass... - We don't know their scores. Over someone who has a 19 and a 10. For me the people you put forward who are also my personal favorites are what I call a consensus. Right. But I respect the principle because it's a group decision. Here, let me give you mine. Those who don't want to see them don't have to look. Pascale. Thank you. - Thank you. - Madam chairwoman. Camille is on there. Oh, yes, she definitely... Louise will probably advance because she's third overall. She's third overall after the various stages. Quentin, four. Jean-Marc will really need to work on this. I think one or two of these... - Will be thrown out. - from our top six will be thrown out. - The guy with the mustache has had it. - Really? Why? His grades are really bad. He's 11th. - Where is he? - 11th in the first and second rounds. I need to understand. Are we talking about Louise? Or is this about something broader? - We need Jean-Marc's scores. - They're not going to change the grades. We'll give Jean-Marc our grades, he'll tell us what he thinks and we'll... The grades can change, it's more a matter of gut feeling. Christel, for the final deliberations Jean-Marc will bring a ranking with scores. He will have worked through the scores we've given him from the start, He'll have fed them into his computer and he'll give us a list which won't necessarily be our top six. From there, we discuss. That's how it's going to work. So you are going to have to deal with the math, which will annoy you. No no, it's not that it annoys me, but the math should bend to our wishes. Of course. That's better than our wishes bending to the math. I'd rather the math bend to my wishes. - That's what I said. - Didn't you just say the opposite? - I must have misheard you. - I just worded it differently. Well? It's not over yet. It's not over yet because it's never that simple when it comes to the final deliberations. We need to let the panel think through it. They'll reach an agreement in the end. Isn't there a time limit? Not really, no. There is a typical time, it's usually 6 p.m. But you always have to give it time because often they hesitate with good reason. And up to the last minute, you have to stay, as I said to them today, careful. Weigh your decisions. Okay, sorry to do this to you: One, two, three and up it goes. It's good news. Your name's there. They left my name off. Where are you? - What's your name? Alexis? - Yes. I'm not on the list, that's it for me. - Is it your first time applying? - Yes. - The very first time? - Yes. - I was at your interview. - Really? This morning? And they said probably yes, depending on the other candidates. Of course. Aurore's there at the top of the list. - They thought it would be a yes. - Yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. Okay? - Jean-Marc, we can't see you. - That's it. Is that okay? - You need to... Hang on, I'll... - Go straighten them out. I'm coming to straighten you out. Three, two, one... That's it. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you okay? Try to relax. - Yes, I'm fine. One last one and I'm done. - That's it. Thank you. - Thanks. We met by chance at the theater... - See you. - Thank you. - Another. - Next! - Which department are you in? - Bad start! Production. Production. And you are? - Do you want a chair, Marie? - No, I won't be staying long. Yes, we've all been through it. Even you? Hello. - You don't have to sit down. - What do I do? - Nothing. - Right. Just find a position for the portrait. - There. - Thanks. Good luck. - That's it. Thanks. - Thank you. He's already signed in. Hello. That's good. Oh, right, okay. I wasn't sure where to go, whether it was left or right. - Which department, please? - Screenwriting. Screenwriting, and your name is? One more. A couple more... That's it. So awful. It can't be helped. We'll take a few, so you can put yourself together.
