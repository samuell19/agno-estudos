(grandiose music) (gentle piano music) - Hello. What's your name? Go ahead. (gentle orchestral music) - Shoo. Get on now, shoo. Get on now. Shoo! Shoo! Old Black just about walked off. Where's that girl again? - Can I help out? - You had your chance, I told you, if you wanna go to school, you prove you can get your work done here. - It'll be done tomorrow before school, I promise. - No. - You lost your chance. Not a soul to help since your father died 16 years ago. (knocking) - Mother, may I come in? - Elnora, if it's about high school. - Oh, Mother, please, I really wanna go to school. - Seven years of schooling is plenty good enough. It's not as if I ask somebody to help out here. The farm is more important! - Yes, Mother. (door closing) (crickets chirping) Why is mama so stubborn? Was your mother this difficult Freckles? If only you could tell me what to do. I know I can do the high school lessons. I studied all summer. Ms. Sims, remember her? My teacher at Bershowitz School, she passed me on with honors and said, "Elnora, you have the mind to go right through to college and beyond if you work hard." I know you think it's in poor taste to brag, but I guess I'm doing it because I'm scared. I'm scared I won't be able to go Freckles. (sighing) But I've gotta figure this out tonight because tomorrow school starts. (rooster crowing) (door slamming) (horse whinnying) - Mmh. Chores are done. (horse grunting) Morning. - Good morning. (door closing) Milkin's done. - Better wash up and change your clothes. It's a long walk to town. - Mother? You'll let me go? Oh, thank you, Mother. Oh, you'll never regret this. - Hurry up or you'll be late. Just be home as quick as you can. (giggling) You've gone off forgetting your food. - I don't want anything to eat. - You'll take this or you'll not go one step more. Walk almost three miles and then no food from one till late in the day. Pretty figure you'd cut if you had your way. Fixed it special. It's chicken, your favorite. - Thank you, Mother, goodbye. - Not so fast. No child of mine'll walk the streets of Onabasha looking like a play actress woman. Wet your hair and pull it back decent while I find something warm in case the weather turns. And remember this, Elnora, there won't be any place to run off to when the going gets too hard. No safe secret places to sing and pretend the hours away. Although why you love that ugly dangerous swamp is beyond me. - There's great beauty in it, Mother, when you know how to look. - You won't fit in with those frilly town girls. - I'll be late. Goodbye. - Keep warm. Come directly back home. (whimsical music) - [Billy] Help! Help! Get away! Get away! (dog barking) - Bad dog! Get! Get! Get outta here! Go home! You can come down. It's all right now. (groaning) Billy, don't you go to school? - Didn't have much a chance for that. - Oh. - Probably got some food in there, huh? Maybe even more than you'd want. - I'll look and see. - Your ma pack this grub for you? - Yeah. - You sure are lucky, ma'am. You got yourself a ma. - Well, where are your folks? - Pa's comin' get me. That milk you got in that jug? - Where's your mother then? - Took sick and died. So me and my Pa, we hit the road. Livin' on trains mostly. Where do you live? - Back up the road in Limberlost. (suspenseful piano music) (bell ringing) - Excuse me. Would you please tell me where the freshmen go? - The same place as the freshmen. (giggling) - I'll wager you're the first person I meet when I find it. - Have you ever seen an uglier hat? (bell ringing) (door closing) - Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you all right? If you're looking for my music auditions, they're right- - No. (sighing) Can you tell me where the freshmen go? - Around the corner, three doors to your left and the bell has rung. Uh, miss? Do you have your schedule and book list? - Book list? - The textbooks you must purchase. - Algebra presumes the prior knowledge of basic computation. (class laughing) As I was saying, we will begin with a review. Volunteers? Yes, you. Uh, yes, and all right. And since you were late, you can be the next volunteer. Well done, Miss Cornstalk. - My name is Comstock. - Then why did you write cornstalk? - In my nerves I may have made a mistake. - I see. (people chattering) (horn blowing) (girls giggling) - [Man] Lovely day indeed. (bell ringing) - Can I help you? - Yes, sir. I'm with the freshmen class. - Over here. - Thank you, but I was wondering if it was possible maybe to exchange. - Five dollars and 50 cents. - Exchange maybe for- - Used books are half price, Miss. - I mean, for goods. Like eggs, something from the farm. - I'm sorry, I can't do that. - For work? Sweeping up. - My son helps me run the store. - Oh. (bell ringing) (trees rustling) (ax chopping) (cow mooing) - I forgot to tell you to bring home the scraps for the chickens. - There weren't any scraps. And I'm hungry again. - I'm surprised. You had a good healthy lunch. - Yes, Mother. - Well, we can eat first and do the work afterward. Where have you been? I expected you an hour ago. I see you been crying. I thought you'd get your fill in a hurry. - Did you know I'd look funny? - Funny? - Yes. - No one else wears boots like this or dresses like these anymore. No one else had a funny old hat. My hair was all wrong. I didn't know where to go, I didn't know what to do. They all laughed at me. - Don't matter. Tomorrow we'll get up early and haul the beets for winter, then we'll spend the rest of the day hoeing the turnips. - No, Mother. - What? - Maybe the hardest is over. Tomorrow, they'll know what to expect and sooner or later, they'll stop laughing. (rooster crowing) The only problem is that I can't go back without books. - Now you want money, too. - I need five dollars and 50 cents. - I told you I couldn't afford a cent for going to school, I told you not to ask me for money. - I never knew about buying books. - Well, I did. You're so bulldog stubborn, I thought you better find out for yourself. - You knew? - Of course I knew. Everybody has to pay for everything. You don't pay one way, you do another. Of course I knew you had to pay. - You mean you let me go into town, into that school, knowing- - You went, and you found out you can't afford it. Now all this high school foolishness is over. - Perhaps someday I will learn to understand you. I certainly cannot now. You can't possibly realize what you let me go through today. I'll get the money somehow. I'll raise it myself. I'm going back tomorrow and the next day and the next. You need not come out, I'll finish all my work alone. - [Kate] Elnora! (tree rustling) - I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, ma'am. - Took me nearly an hour to set this up and now look at it. - I'm sorry, I couldn't see. I mean, I didn't know that you were- - Well, I understand that. It's also difficult for me to see with tears in my eyes. - I've been upset. - So have I. Nevermind, I'm losing the light away. I have to catch the moths as soon as they come out. - Catch moths? - In pictures. I photograph the Limberlost. Well, that is what's left of the Limberlost. Darn loggers are destroying everything. Did you know that? I was working down the south end of the swamp and I came back to take pictures of my hatchings and the whole areas was gone, just crushed by the trees that they killed. - Well, why did they cut down the trees? - Business. Just business. Then what'll happen? Where will the birds make their nests? What'll be the homes for all the butterflies and all the other living things? All keep the air clean. With the trees gone, even the clouds will be in danger. (sighing) - Yes, ma'am. - And look at this today. I nearly had an imperialis and now that's gone. - I'm sorry, I didn't- - It's all right. I probably had to be going anyway. Being in the Limberlost at night frightens me. - Well, I'm here at night all the time. Maybe I can find something that you're looking for. I see a lot of things. - Then you live near here? - Yes. Just right over there. - [Gene] So you know your way around the swamp? - Well, no one really knows the Limberlost completely. People have died here. - But you come here anyway? Because it's so beautiful. I understand. - Let me help, please. Here. - All right. - I hope that you can get the pictures that you need some other time. - Oh, I will. I don't give up easily. - Hello, I'm Mrs. Porter. - You're on private property. - I'm just going to the road. My carriage is over there. I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you, but this is the only safe path out of the Limberlost. The south tracks are being used by the loggers. - They're not coming here to log. This is my land. - Yes, I understand and I respect- - I have work to do. - Well, my work takes me into the Limberlost and this is the only path. - That's not my fault. This is private property. - You've made that quite clear. Good day. - She's the most interesting person. First I thought she was a man. Are you listening? (Freckles cooing) She's a lady. A wonderful lady. She takes photographs and talking about nature. It was if I'd known her before. (Freckles cooing) (gentle piano music) (gentle orchestral music) (rooster crowing) - Since you're so set on going, you might as well eat right. - Thank you, Mother. What was it like when you went to school? - Same as for you. - Were the town girls always mean? - You can't trust those townspeople. Too much time for themselves I suppose. - Did you like school? - I didn't keep it up. More important things to do. - Such as? - I don't know Elnora. I worked with my parents on their farm. Then I met your father. It was a long time ago. Don't hope for too much my girl. Your father had all kind of dreams. Here. Take your food. At least we're fortunate to have more than enough for that. - Thank you for the lunch. - Foolish dreams. (birds chirping) - [Man] Good morning, ma'am. (bell ringing) - Well, the girl from the Limberlost. You come a long way to high school. Your parents must be very proud. - I only have a mother. She isn't always happy about school, but I come anyway. - Good for you. Can I tell you something? I once entered a town school straight from the country. I wore a brown calico dress and my shoes were very heavy. - Did they, uh? - Yes, they did. All of it, they didn't miss a thing. - Yesterday on the blackboard, they changed my name to Cornstalk. For a minute I thought I'd died. - What should it be? - Comstock. Elnora Comstock. - I'm Gene Stratton-Porter. I don't wanna tell you how many ways they found to change that. (laughing) - Did you make them stop? - Yes. I worked on my books. You'll see. You work on your books and before long, you'll hear yesterday's tormentors boasting that they were once classmates of yours. - Will be there anything else today Mrs. Porter? - No, thank you. Good day Elnora. - Thank you Mrs. Porter. (bell ringing) - Now, how many I help my second customer of the day? - I need the books on this list. - Right over here. - I really need them, but I can't pay just yet. Please let me take them and I'll pay on Friday or I'll return them as perfect as they are. Please, trust me. - I'd like to, but your family doesn't have an account here. Perhaps your parent could come in and open one. - Do you know someone who needs a good worker? - You'll have to check along the street. - [Woman] Morning. - Good morning. - Nice day. I've got quite a list for you. - Excuse me. Is it Mrs. Porter that wants butterflies and moths? - Yes. - Thank you. (horse whinnying) - So, for tomorrow, you will reread chapter two and be prepared to answer some questions. (bell ringing) Dismissed. (kids chattering) - Go, go, go, let's go. - Snake! - She touched it. - [Girl] Oh, look at her. - She's a farmer. (door closing) - That was really brave. - It wouldn't have hurt anyone. It's not that kind of snake. Somebody might have stepped on it. - No, I mean, isn't is slimy and disgusting? - No. But I guess farmers are strange. - I didn't say that. I think being brave is good. It was brave of you to come to school here. - Why? Because country girls can't read and write? Is that what you think? - You could let someone talk to you without snapping their head off. - Sally. It was nice of you to say that. - Elnora. You may join us. We're getting candy. - Don't invite her. - I said she could come. Come on, I'm treating. - Thank you, but I gotta get home right away. - Elnora. Elnora. I'll give 'em back to you for the rest of your lunch. - Come on, Billy, give 'em back. Billy. Billy, come on. (girls laughing) - So you know Billy. - [Girl] She would. - I gave him some of my lunch. Some of us share with those that are less fortunate instead of teasing them. (birds whistling) Oh, how pretty. I wonder what your name is? - Hello! How do you like baloney? - Never had any. And don't sneak up on me. - Then maybe you'd like to try some today. Anything you got at home will be fine to trade. Anything. - Billy, where do you live? - Wanna trade or not? - First you tell me where you live. Billy! That's mine. Come back here! Billy! Billy! Ouch. Billy! Billy? - Pretty good, huh? Don't get rained on. - You sleep here? - Pa and me, we slept in worse places. - You can't stay here. It's going to get cold. You gotta find a barn somewhere. - My Pa told me to wait right here. - Look at this place. - If you don't like my house, get outta here. I can take care of myself. See. I got plenty places to stay. Get! (gentle music) - Aren't you going out for lunch today? - No, I'm going to eat inside. Aren't you going out? - I'd love to but my mother makes me take violin lessons, I hate them. - Oh, I'd love to hear you play. (cow mooing) - Ma'am? - Yes. - Elnora told me to come. - [Kate] Elnora told you to come here? - She said I could sleep in her barn. - Uh-huh. Well, it's not her barn, it's mine. - You're Elnora's mama? - Yes. - You're the best cooker in the whole world. - Now how'd you know that? - I tasted some of her fried chicken. I ain't never ate fried chicken that delicious in my whole life. - In your whole life, I see. - Do you like baloney? - Sometimes, when it comes from little boys. - Here you go. - So she's thinking you could do some work around here, is that it? - Yes, ma'am. - Are you hungry? - Sure am. - Here, you churn the butter and I'll see what there is for you to eat. - Yes, ma'am. - Where are your parents? - My mother died. My Pa's coming back. We used to ride the rails. Got off here. He's gonna find me soon. My Pa used to wrap me in his coat. I can sleep anyplace. On the floor, anywhere. If you had an old coat I could- - Well, I don't know if I can use you yet. You gotta prove yourself. There's a lot of work around here. - [Billy] Yes, ma'am. - We'll see. - No. I'm really not very good. - Really, I'd like to listen. Play something now. - All right. - Beautiful. (violin music) - [Mr. Hinton] A, Miss Brownlee, that's supposed to be an A. - May I try? - Do you know how? - Show me. - Just move it back and forth. (violin music) - Better. See, that proves what practicing can do. Miss Brownlee, practice is only effective when you are the one who is doing it. - Mr. Hinton, I was just showing- - Never mind the variations, I've already heard the theme. Now go practice. - Yes, sir. - And you, young lady. I see you found the freshman class. - Yes, sir, I'm sorry. It wasn't Sally's fault, I asked. - Do you play the violin? - I'd like to. She was just teaching me. - Oh. Miss Brownlee has graduated to teaching. Well, beginner's lessons with me are 50 cents each hour, one day a week and you practice the other days, Miss, uh, what's your name? - 50 cents every time? I see. Well, thank you, sir. - [Mr. Hinton] What's your name? - I can't afford the lessons. - What is your name? - Elnora Comstock, sir. - Come back. Come back. Oh, my. My, my, you have grown into a fine young lady. Let me see your hands. - It's hard to keep them nice. We live on a farm. - I know. I know. So, you're Robert Comstock's child. You're tall just like he was. I see him in you. - Did you know my father? - Robert Comstock was the best violinist I ever taught. - You taught my father? - Well, to be precise, I don't think anyone taught Robert Comstock. I gave him lessons. You see, I used to think it wasn't fair for someone with that much talent to have that much fun, too. - He had fun? - Oh, my dear, your father played for all the town dances. Of course he got married and- - Do you know what happened? My mother says he died in the Limberlost swamp. - I know very little about that night. Your mother is the one. See, I lost touch with him after he left school. That's an A Miss Brownlee. Elnora Comstock, your lessons will be every Tuesday during lunch. - Well, sir, I- - Don't bother me about money. And I have a violin that you can use. I don't think Ms. Brownlee would mind if we borrowed the remainder of her lesson. Shall we? Come. - Mother, I'm home! - Thanks, Elnora, your mom is real nice. - What are you doing here? - I'm gonna do some work. - Somebody has to help instead of running off with strangers. - Well, Mother, I have some wonderful news. - I throw away enough to feed a little tyke like him every day. - [Elnora] Don't you wanna hear my news? - Since you sent him here, I guess you mean for him to take your place. This is my special spice cake and you are gonna love it. - Mm-mm. - Isn't that good? I told you, huh? (gentle music) - Aren't you lovely. Oh, you feel so soft. (gentle orchestral music) (doorbell ringing) - Yes? - The notice in the store said you wanted butterflies and moths? - Yes, but I didn't expect those so early. - Oh, I'll go. - No, come in. Come in. Please, let me see what you have. - Oh, no. I was so careful. - I'm sure you were. It's the moss. There are little bugs in the moss that love to eat butterfly wings. Now, next time what you'll do is you'll mount it on a wooden board like this, I'll show you how to do that. - I didn't know. I thought that- - It's a wonderful regalis. I haven't been able to find one of these for two winters. It'll make a very handsome photograph. The colors are still fresh. - You can use it? - Oh, yes. Yes, I'm updating this book. This one. - I didn't know there were books like this. - Oh, I didn't either. - [Elnora] Oh. - I bet I was a lot like you. I used to walk through the woods all the time. Still do. - The photographs are so beautiful. Or are they paintings? - Oh, no, they're photos. I color them myself. - Oh. This one. I seen this one. It's beautiful. - That's an imperialis. That's very rare. Let me show you something. Come here. This is a male imperialis. See, how I've left space for its mate. But in all these years I've never found one. - Then it would be valuable. - Oh, yes, extremely. I've also written a book on birds if you're interested. That's when they started calling me the bird woman. - Do you feel bad? - No, not at all. I prefer birds to some humans I've encountered. Just as I see you prefer these. - When I found out they die so soon, I started saving them. - I thought the same thing. But in their little lives, how much they do. - Do? - Oh, those little beings have a very big job, carrying pollen to create new plants. Well, just think without their delicate wings how barren the world would be. Everything in nature depends on one another. We're all part of a chain. When I was your age, nature inspired me with wonderment and still does. Now, about this regalis. - I'm sorry I did them wrong. - It's all right, when I was your age I did much worse. Now I'll show you how to open the wings when they get hard. What you do is you put them in a cloth like this. It's been wet for several days. Now they should be quite soft. And you hold them by the thorax like that and you press. The wings will open up and you take a little mounting pen and put it through. You put it in your board. - Yes. - Then they'll harden in about five days and you'll have a perfect specimen. - Oh. - I'm going to give you these so that next time when you come you'll know what you have and you can do better. - You mean I can come again? - I certainly hope so. - Prices? - Mm-hmm. For the moths and the cocoons, they'll be spinning soon. - You would pay me for them? - Absolutely. - I'll look very hard for the cocoons and I promise next time I'll do better. Thank you. - Here. This is for what you brought me today. - You want them? - They're very valuable to me. Very, very valuable. - Thank you. - You're welcome, Elnora. (horse whinnying) (knocking) - Dear, I told you before, we don't trade. - Is this enough for the freshman books? This is the first thing I've ever bought with my own money. (engine idling) - [Kate] What are you doin'? - [Thaddeus] Are you Mrs. Comstock? - I am. - Thaddeus Applegate, county assessor. - Assessor, what's that, tax collector? - Well, we don't actually collect, you receive a notice. - I pay my taxes. Paid 'em same every year since my husband passed. - It must be quite a burden for a woman, looking after this much property on your own. - I don't see how that's your concern. If you have a paper to give me, I'll get back to work. - It's not that simple. You've got some valuable property here. Standard beech. Plenty healthy mature oak. Early maple, elm, black walnut. - Get to the point. - The point is Mrs. Comstock, with the timber interest moving into our country, your assets on this property are very valuable. - Thank you. - That means they'll bring a much higher tax. - What? You're telling me I'm gonna have to pay more for my own trees. These trees have been here since long before I was married. - I'm sure. I'm sure if your husband was here, he'd understand that times are changing. New roads have to be built for automobiles and the town high school, now there was a very large expansion. - How much? - These figures are just for our appraisal. You'll receive a notice. - If I don't know how much, how am I gonna get it? - You have no need to worry, just sell off some of the trees. - Never. Robert loved those trees, they're part of this land. Some of them he planted himself. - Well, it's your choice ma'am. I'd say better sell off some of those valuable trees than lose the whole farm. - Lose the farm? (suspenseful music) (birds whistling) (violin music) - I was playing the violin. (Freckles cooing) (violin note playing) - That's it, yes. (violin music) Very good, once more. More clarity. (violin music) - Good, now put them together. (violin music) - Well, violins must cost a lot. - Now, don't talk. Concentrate on the feel. Get back to the original hand position. (violin music) - He did quite well playing for those local dancers. I'll never forget the day that he earned enough to buy that violin of his. Robert polished it till it glowed. (violin music) Your father used to make it sing. (violin music) - Billy! (cow mooing) - Is it lunchtime yet? - You just ate breakfast. When you finish getting all the eggs, we'll get out to the field and I'll show you how to stack corn. - Farming's hard work. - You get all the eggs now. (owl hooting) - I was out this way and, uh, thought I'd drop by. - $150? That's more than double the tax we pay. - I knew you'd be surprised. I did everything I could to help. See, that's why I came out here personally. The lumber company's paying others around here top dollar for their timber. - No! I told you before we're not cutting our trees. - I see. Do you have some other plan? - I got enough for the old tax. The seed corn's real good this year. - Tax is due at the end of the month, you know. - We'll pay on time. - Well, just in case, remember the lumber company pays upfront. - Good day, Mr. Applegate. (cow mooing) - Guess what? I got something to tell you. Today at school- - Be quiet Elnora. The county tax man came here today. There's gonna be a lot more taxes on the farm. - Oh? - So get into your work clothes. Won't be needing those town frills anymore. - What do you mean? If we don't pay, they're gonna take the farm? But it's ours. - Yes, my girl. Now maybe you understand why I've kept you close. This farm your father left us is everything we have. - Well, can we sell enough crops to pay it? - The only way I can figure is if we double up our work and clear the fields quick. We'll hurry and bring the whole crop to market. - I'll get up early in the morning and work and come home right after school. - No, my dear. The only hope is if we work straight through, dawn to dark and before the weather changes. - Then I can't go to school. - Might as well get rid of those books. (rooster crowing) (cow mooing) (rooster crowing) (birds whistling) (violin music) (horse whinnying) - I'm almost sure it's clean. - What are you doing in that getup? - Going to school. I have to return some books to Mrs. Porter. - Don't you understand that soon there won't be a home to come back to? - Mother, can't we just- - Maybe that other woman and those fancy town people is where you think you belong. - No, Mother. - Now, get rid of those books and get to work. Maybe we can sell them back. - I won't sell my books. - You've got to Elnora. - Why have you never told me about my father's music? (rooster crowing) - Who told you about that? - What happened to his violin? - It died with him. Robert and music died together. - No. I don't believe that. It just doesn't die. It just doesn't happen. - She didn't mean it. You do love her, don't you? - [Man] Timber! (trees crunching) Timber! (trees crashing) - What are you doing? Don't you understand that thousands of animals live in here? - What is that noise? - Loggers. They're felling trees at the other end of the Limberlost. - Elnora's father did this? - Yep, a lot of days, side by side, only I was holding nails and he'd be fixing. Built part of the house and all these fences himself. This here, Robert's handiwork. Every foot of it from our own lumber. - Sure do need a man around here. (laughing) - I have to admit it, it does feel good to laugh. I hadn't laughed much since, hmm. - Was Elnora's Pa funny? - Well, not exactly, but when I was younger, we had fun. It was a long time ago. - Did you dance? - Sometimes. - You used to dance? - Robert played the fiddle so we went to all the country dances. - [Billy] Show me. (scoffing) - No. - Please? (humming) (upbeat violin music) - Here. Take this to the barn Mr. Man. Help him Elnora. (somber music) (horse whinnying) - I told you stay off my land. - Please put down the weapon Mrs. Comstock. - How'd you know my name? - Your daughter Elnora told me. - So, it's you meddlin' with my girl. - Your daughter is a wonderful girl. I was happy to help. - We don't need any help, Mrs. Porter. - I meant with her schooling. I met her in the Limberlost when I was taking pictures for my book. Would you like to see? - I don't need pictures of what I seen all my life. Neither does Elnora. Girl's head's already filled with nonsense. She's needed here. - It doesn't have to be that way for Elnora. She's got great potential. - When people like us get filled up with dreams, no good comes of it. A mother knows what's best and I will not have you giving her impossible dreams. - Mrs. Comstock, I have children, too. They're grown and gone. It wasn't easy, but I knew that when birds get too big for the nest, the mother pushes them out. That's how they start to fly. - Stay away from my daughter! (horse whinnying) Get back to work! - Go fetch me some water Billy. - I'm on my way. - Elnora! What a big place. I had no trouble finding it. Everybody knew where the Comstock farm was. Sorry for coming all of a sudden. It's just, you weren't in school for two weeks, so Mr. Hinton asked if I would come and so- - How are your violin lessons going? - Fine. Terrible. You were getting really good he said. But he wanted me to tell you if you don't come back in a few days, you'll be expelled. - Expelled? - That's the rule. So you have to. - I can't, Sally. - Why not? - 'Cause if we don't bring in the crop, we're gonna lose the farm. So will you tell him that for me please? And tell Mr. Hinton that I, just tell him I said thank you. - Well, it's really pretty here. - I can show you my secret place if you want. - You've got a secret place? - It's in the swamp, it's dangerous. There's hidden rivers under the grass and if you get lost, you could drown. - Good, let's go! (birds chirping) - This is really something. - Sally, look at this. This is a cocoon of a polyphemus moth. - First of all, what's it made of? - Well, anything it finds in the trees. It weaves it together in its own silk. - What are you going to do with it? - Oh, I know a woman who buys things like this. She writes books and pays me money. And she can do anything she wants. - Really? - This is Freckles. - [Sally] I never knew anybody with a pet owl. - Well, I brought him here when I found him hurt. He can't fly anymore. - He doesn't bite or anything? - [Elnora] No, see. (Freckles cooing) (Freckles cooing) - You're the first person I've ever shown this place. On purpose. - I wish I had a secret place. Is this where you fix your butterflies? - Yes. - Elnora. I just had an idea how you can stay in school. - I managed to forget about that for a moment. - Listen to me. You have to try. Since you sold those butterflies, what if you sold lots more? - I thought of that. - So? - My mother won't let me go into town anymore. She even told Mrs. Porter not to talk to me. It's because she needs me here so much. - Just don't tell her. Do it. - You're my friend. Thank you for coming. - So I'll see you in school? - All right. Bye-bye. Thank you. What do you think Freckles? Huh? - I have something you want. - You don't have anything I want. Where'd you get that? - I found it in the bushes. - You stole that from Mrs. Porter. - I found it. - How am I gonna give it back to her? You little monster. Come back here. - [Hobo] Anybody home? - I can't hire any farmhands. - Mrs. Comstock. - [Kate] What do you want? - You got a boy named Billy here? - Yes, I have Billy. - Ma'am, I knew his daddy. He wanted the boy to have the coat if anything. I traveled with him after Onabasha, so he talked to me some. I know he left the boy in Onabasha. Some of the folks in town said they saw your girl with him. - Why did he leave the boy? - Don't know, ma'am. Looks like it was a good idea. - What happened to him? - Died on a train to Lafayette. - I'm sorry. Would you want some hot food? - I have to catch a train. (door squeaking) (clock ticking) - [Elnora] Mother you know what Billy did? - Did not. - Mother, Billy took the- - I have to talk to Billy. - My Pa is back? That's his coat. He would never leave his coat. Where is he? - Billy. A man came today and brought the coat. - That's his coat. He used to wrap me in his coat. - Yes, but your Pa isn't here. He died in another city. - That man didn't know. Not even Pa's coat. Pa's coat was tore up like this. - I'm sorry. - No! We used to ride the rails and one day I just got lost. - [Kate] Billy, he's not coming back. You have to be strong. - You did it 'cause you always want money. You took his coat. - You can stay here Billy. - You knew it a long time ago. Just didn't tell me 'cause you wanted me to keep working. - The man came today. - Why'd you have to go and tell me? You ruined everything. You're lying. Lying, you're lying, you're lying, you're lying. (sobbing) - He's gone now Billy. Let him go. (gentle music) Say goodbye to your Pa. Say goodbye. (crickets chirping) - Just gotta keep going I guess. Just like Mrs. Porter. She writes books even though people used to tell her she couldn't. - Maybe you can play the violin anyhow. - You think so? - Sure you can. My Pa is never coming back. I know it now 'cause he'd never leave his coat. - Well, you can stay with us. Mother said. - Why doesn't owl fly away? - Well, he was hurt so bad when I first found him that he'll never fly again. He's healthy now except for his wing. He's a friend. - Gonna give it to that lady? - I'm gonna try. It's not very special. - Mighty pretty, though. - You know, she said if I can find an imperialis, she'd pay me lots of money. - Really? Oh, I won't steal from her no more. - And I'll never tell about the box. - Agreed? - Agreed. - This is the last stack. - This is the best seed corn we've ever grown. About to get us some money for sure. - There sure is enough of it. - 121, 122. Just $28 to go. - But taxes are due right way. - Just time enough to bring the seed corn to market. - I could go back to school. - If you work early and late in the fields tomorrow and we get it all in. - Hurray! (thunder blasting) - Hitch up the horse, bring the cart to the field. Let's bring all we can to the barn or we'll lose all the corn! - Lightening won't get you. - Billy, come on, get your coat on. (horse whinnying) (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) (dramatic music) (thunder blasting) - Come on, it's no use. Take what we have to the barn. Come on Mother! - Come on, we gotta go in. - No! (thunder blasting) (Kate grunting) (horse whinnying) - Mother stop! Mother stop, please! Come on. You have to stop! Please, Mom, please! Please stop! Please stop! Please stop her, please. No, no. Stop! Stop her! No! (thunder blasting) - All the corn. All the corn. First they'll cut down our trees and take the farm. - Mother, it's all right. (thunder blasting) - What you gonna do? - You stay with Mother. I'm going to check on Freckles. - [Billy] Elnora, don't go! (thunder blasting) (rain pounding) (thunder blasting) - All these years I kept it up. You would've been proud. Best seed corn, you should have seen it. (sobbing) (thunder blasting) (Freckles cooing) (door squeaking) (thunder blasting) (Freckles cooing) (thunder crashing) Oh! Oh, it's all right. It's all right Freckles. Freckles, it's all right, it's all right. (crickets chirping) What a storm. Huh, Freckles? Are you all right, huh? (Freckles cooing) Yes? Good, good, good. (Freckles cooing) Imperialis. Oh, my Freckles. (gentle music) (doorbell ringing) Oh, please. - Oh, dear, what have you done? - I found an imperialis. - Oh, you did, didn't you? That's wonderful. Come in, come in. (door closing) (rooster crowing) (cow mooing) (door closing) - Mother! Mother! - You're not dead, I thought you drowned for sure. - I almost did once or twice. - [Kate] Where've you been? - Mother, look. I got it. Here. It's for you. For the taxes. - Where'd you get that money? - From selling a moth. I found the one that's very rare. She said she- - She? She? That woman from town? - She collects insects and she said that maybe I could have a vocation after high school. - Vocation? This farm is your future. Your father left us this land. - And because of her we can keep it. - Because of her? I work my fingers to the bone and all you can say is because of her. - Now you don't have to worry about the farm. I was hoping you'd be glad. - Better get changed outta those wet clothes. (rooster crowing) (violin music) - I haven't heard that since your father performed. That's an oriole song, isn't it? - You understood. - Oh, you certainly are your father's child. Those were his two loves. Music and the Limberlost. He used to take his violin out there to listen. To listen. - But I thought you said he played for the town dances? - Oh, he did, he did that, too. But he was different from all the other players. Not because of how he learned to play, but how he learned to hear. - I wish I'd known him. We could have played together in the Limberlost. - Oh, he would've like that. Well. We should begin. (people chattering) (engine idling) - Why good afternoon, Mr. Applegate, it is a pleasure to see you. - Hello, Mrs. Comstock. So sorry about that storm. Your corn crop must be ruined. - It couldn't have come at a worse time. - Well, step over to my office, I'll send my secretary with a note to Mr. White of the lumber company. - Oh, I wouldn't trouble you to do that, Mr. Applegate. I've come to pay my tax. - You've got it all. - Every cent. (door closing) (stamp pounding) Do it again. (Stamp pounding) I like the sound. (door closing) (violin music) - Mother. - Stop it. - Kate, please. - Stop it. That song. That song was. - Kate, please. - You. You took Robert from me and now- - [Mr. Hinton] Kate, it was never- - You want her, too. Well, you'll never get her. If you hadn't tempted him, I'd still have my husband. I never gave you permission for this! Never! - It isn't me taking them from you Kate! - Let me go! - No, you're gonna hear me. - Why! Why did you have to ruin it for me? - I ruined it for you? Don't you think you- - Don't you understand? I wanted you to hear me. I wanted you to be proud of me. - Now, you understand, missy. I have fed and sheltered you. You have taken everything I have. - Taken? I tried to love you. You do love me, don't you, Mother? - The truth? All right. You can take yourself to high school and stand up on that stage, you're ready. I would've had a life if it wasn't for that music. The night you were born, your father was playing his fiddle for some people in town. It was Mr. Hinton's fault. Tempted him with crazy dreams to be a fiddler. - Leave me alone. - I usually went with him. But it had rained, the way it poured last night. I was close to my time for birthing you. He didn't want me getting wet, catching cold. But he just had to get out of here with that fiddle. He must've called when he slipped in the river, but I never heard him. Because of you I wasn't with him! I wasn't with him when he called. - And it's my fault? - I didn't say, I didn't mean- - Then you really do hate me. (cow mooing) - I made it for you. Here. I made it for you 'cause you're always making stuff for us. Yuck! (doorbell ringing) - What is it dear? (sobbing) - Can I talk to you? - You're so cold. - It doesn't matter anymore. - Tell me. - I found out about my father. He drowned in the swamp the day I was born. It was my fault. That's why she hates me. - She probably said that out of pain. I feel she's waiting at home for you right now. - I can't go home Mrs. Porter. She doesn't want me. Now I understand everything. - Don't let her win Elnora. Don't let her stop you. - She only wanted him all these years. - She probably loved him very much. My guess is she's afraid. - Not her. - She's afraid of being left alone. - She said he drowned because of me. - You know better than that. You know how the Limberlost is after a storm. The river was too deep. Your mother couldn't have saved him. No one could. Except you. Play for him. And yourself. - All these things that you talk about, I once wanted my mother to be a part of them, but- - [Mrs. Porter] Yes. - I'll go on myself. - You all right, Mrs. Comstock? - Do you know where I'll find Elnora? - She said her place was a secret 'cause you'd get real angry. - I'm not angry anymore Billy. - She goes to a place in the Limberlost. - Show me. - Elnora's shown me where it's safe to walk. - I haven't put a foot in here since. - [Billy] Over here. - There's no one here. - Freckles is here. (Freckles cooing) - [Kate] This is my daughter. - Mother. What are you doing in here? - I thought I was keeping you safe, but I drove you away. This is for you. It was your father's. (gentle violin music) (sobbing) - Sweetie. Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry. (gentle orchestral music)
