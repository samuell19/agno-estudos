- How, ladies. - Safely! I am not young anymore. Here you go, ma'am. How dare you sit in the ladies' seats with your stinking hick? Get out of here! All Magyars, Czechs and Jews should be beaten... The beast stealing and begging, and what makes the Emperor? Herr Herzl, we're waiting for you! I have enabled me in honor of you. Look here, ladies and gentlemen. I can not stand it trutteri out more. - Who do you think you are? God himself? - Yes, hallowed be my name. I just came in two new bids. The first: Although some people believe to be gentlemen - there is only one God, and it's me. The second: Everyone is equal, when the black also shit brown. Then perform a miracle. Look here. Look over here one last time, ladies and gentlemen. I see something you do not see... What the hell do you really see me? I am poor, old and ugly. I'm not a blonde lipizzanerhingst from Vienna. Shlomo, no one else can tell stories like you. It was cooler by Lobkowitz conjured thunder forward. - Is he really God? - Obviously not. He is a mad kosher chef who was fired by his boss - because he mixed cheese with boiled meat. - Really? - It is contrary to the Mosaic Law. If he is not God, why do you treat him as plague you as if he was? Share your must with your next but spare him for your vinegar. How is the Jewish teachings. Maybe I feel sorry for this God. Every human being is a kind of God. Bible! Book of books. Whoever buys this book need no other books. It contains everything: world's beginning and end... The Old and New Testament's... Great miracles and prophecies... Everything is here in one volume. - what are you waiting for? - I already have a Bible. Very well, my friend... For people already have everything... ... We have "Fanny Hill". Bible externally and internally eroticism. Fanny Hill, the fallen girl exploited and abandoned by evil men. It's all here. Turn on, my gentle friend. If not, it would look like, like you were flat. Lobkowitz! Do your teeth fall out except one, and it must hurt for you die! I was just honest with you. Do you tormented by a thousand fleas and have only one hand to scratch you! I'm sorry I called you Lobkowitz. - Instead of "The Holy". - Yes, instead of it. His name be praised. But I was lost in thoughts. - I'm writing a book. - To me? No. - About Me? - No. - They must be overthrown. Blood must flow. - Himmlischst! This country will never be better, so long living a single jew here. If it were up to me I would throw the cursed, blood-sucking Jews out. - Be quiet. - We need a firm hand... army. A quick war would solve all our problems. You talk nonsense. There is only one book, and it is already written. It says everything about everything. Even the coffee like you just spilled on yourself. No, I have to write my own book to drive evil out of the heart - before it drives me. Sho not into the abyss, in the abyss looks at you. Every morning when we go from here radbrækker I vain brain... How shall I start? Are not you past the start... ...You must start before the start. Give me blood of the noble vine Give me vine Have you gone mad? In you, your drunkard! - Excuse me. - Take him into. What is it? Where is Mrs Merschmeyers home for homeless artists? It's called "My Life". - "My Life"? - Yes. Should it be titled a possible classic? Good evening. Hitler, Adolf. - What about "My memoirs"? - Ghastly. "My memoirs"... Would your mother buy a book called "My memoirs"? I am an orphan. What about "Shlomo and Julia" or "Schlomo and Isolde?" No, you... - What about"My struggle?" - Now it there. Who asked you ? - Is this room No. 4? - Anyone living in No. 4 Does your mother taught you proper manners? Yes, she has. And I followed dedicated her admonitions - Despite my deep-rooted aversion to authority - which was eventually crystallized to an unwavering decision - not to follow in my late father's footsteps. He was felled by fate axe into a premature grave. Not as official but as an artist - I seek happiness in roller city. A call that was predetermined by my considerable artistic talent. I waited a simple answer not Nibelung song. What I find so disgusting and disgusting... from an alien - is your attempt to reduce my verbal abilities to a yes-and-no-play. It'll be fun... Foreigner...? Here are the foreigner. Do not worry, let's start over. Does your mother taught you proper manners? This is not your property. The wading in and penetrate you on. I was actually in the process of a book... to God interrupted me. - Who? - God. He's dead. Want to bet? Loss in advance. Your mother has not been taught you... ... To knock before entering. Smart. I could rip your non- German argument to pieces. But it condescends I'm not. To show my generosity I give myself. - Happy? - They knocked on the door and went inside... wrong. You have to knock and wait to someone yells "come in"... ... And then go into. Try again. Entrez! See, it went just fine. - Coffee? - Nah. - Milk or sugar? - Both. We have no more. The only available bed's. Get out! - Don't you have coat? - No. You can take mine. But only as long as I sleep. There is only heat on for tomorrow. Up, up, folks! Take your things and leave the room. Sleep longer does not make you beautiful. This also applies to you, your little tyrolersæk. What is it? Come in squatting. Then move! Gentlemen, today we offer you a nice potato soup. If you find something else in the it's all about eating. Next, please. Next. Next. - Here you go. - Thank you. Herzl! The kind of eating you do not. Next, please. Thank you for your coat, jew. My father warned me not to believe on everything that is said in Vienna. I advise you not to believe everything what your father told you. I loved my father but denies not our greatest generation conflict. Shut up! Where are your characters, Adolf?! I'll kill you! "I want to be an artist, father." "No way!" he said. "Now more than ever," I said. In school I was the best to subscribe. Thanks. There he is. Letter from the Academy of Fine Arts, Mr. Hitler. You have been allowed to go to the audition. I knew it. Sign here. How did you know I had been authorized? Refusal comes in thicker envelopes. This is thin. May we see? A kind of radical realism. Here is a still life: "corn at dusk." Amazing... it just before mouth watering. - With melted butter. - Steamed up for grabs. - Do you know what watercolor is? - We've heard about it. I call the "My dog at dusk." - This is my dog. - I thought so. Note the perfect perspective and its faithful glance... - Do you like twilight? - It is an artistic challenge. Here is a reverent charcoal drawing: "My mother udbælger peas at dusk." Very poignant, I must say. The art heaven. Come on, Hitler. There. Yes! What is it, Hitler? Everything is as it should be. How am I supposed to study no mother cooked beef? The topics for the test makes me nervous. "Displaced from paradise." Figuratively painting is not my strong point. Speaking of paradise... Where are you going, Hitler? I want to hear what the picture book in the shop window costs. - Shalom. - Good day. I sell unfortunately not books. - But there is one in the shop window. - Yes... Book of Genesis. And I want to buy the book, Mr. Moses. I'm sorry, my lord. This is not a bookstore. - What is it? - It's such that... I am Isaac Mandelbaum, circumcised in the local Jewish community. Why exhibits we saw no symbolizing your craft? And what do gentleman, that I will display in the window? But I can maybe help you otherwise. - I do not know how. - You are surely not from Linz? Linz. How could you know that? Were you born between 1885 and 1889? Exactly. Do we know each other? No, but at the time it seemed my colleague Reb Moishe as mohel. He could never put a straight cut. Therefore pisses you always down pants. See, it is not dry yet. Circumcised? I?! What nerve! My blood is pure as snow. My race is tough as leather, fast as steel and hardy as a greyhound. Do not worry, young man. What was it you called? - Hitler! - You are right. You do not look Jewish. - And you do not Chinese. - Cleverly. Now I say, I'm not Chinese, then you say that you are not a jew... - Your family will be shown from... - Lemberg? A distant cousin. What a coincidence. Welcome to Vienna! A cousin from Lemberg? Fir me for it Stuss! Stuss! Look at that, a word from the Talmud! In Vienna's population register is recorded 23 Hitler. Everyone comes from Odessa, Mukatjeve... ... Or Pirmasens. Have you never heard of Uncle Ben? What Uncle Ben? He who with skeleton? No, with goiter. I've never heard of him. Nonsense. - No, Talmud. - Another cousin? A book. It is also available in German. Here is an example: A pair of twins pass through a chimney. One comes out dirty and the other clean. Who washes? - The dirty. - Wrong. He sees the pure and thinking that he is clean. We try again. One twin get contaminated, the other clean. Who washes? The clean. He sees the dirty and believe that he is dirty. Wrong again. If twins pass through a chimney - how can one stay clean and other dirty? It is Talmud. So this is all Vienna. - Nonsense! Unbelievable. - Do not be so sure. Are you seriously claiming to her there is death? In Vienna, death is a woman, which speaks to the city's advantage. Nonsense! Up, up, folks. And do not forget your pets. Also you Cinderella. Or should you to the scandal uncle? Hurry! Watch Ringer. I'll take care of. Maestro! Morning. Tea or coffee? Come here. I guess I can talk openly with you because you are my protector? Of course, madame. Do not be surprised, Dear Ones. I dødkeder me. How can I keep up to date. Himmlischst for example goes to Spitalgasse every Saturday. But not a woman, but... Mrs. Merschmeyer snouts him. Once a week should Himmlischst... One of my small pleasures in this hole. Come on! - What do you see? - What a fuser... A lot of boasting and then... nothing! Get on with it. - Or you can not handle it? - Yes! Son of a bitch. The sun is shining, love calls... Good morning, Hitler. So we stand up! Arise, my little artist. I put a cultural program together for you. Do you want to kill me? I hate rolling! I'll shit on Kaiserschmarrn! I'm staying here. I am sick. I want to be alone with my guest. - Intercourse, right? - Yes. I should look for the laundry. You're ugly. I could hug you. - The one that Hitler has chutzpah. - What chutzpah, Shlomo? Well, what's chutzpah? Chutzpah is when someone kill his father and mother- - and then invoking mitigating circumstances when he is an orphan - Do you write about Hitler in your book? - Also it. - Me? - Yes... - All...? - So They are thus painter? Work gives freedom, gentlemen. And disarray... ... Is married to the artist aesthetic soul. - Tell a story, Shlomo. - What story...? Any, but not from the Bible. I just need to clear recording sample to art school. Painters, musicians and vegetarians is often Jews. - Do I look like? - Allows you? Judging by your main form are the arias. Do not take it amiss. - We are German nationalists. - Radical. We support the army. On Saturday we shoot on Vienna parasites. Company, forward march! Stand still. Back against the shoulder. And the term here. - It was the fat Frenchman. - Total War! It was the Jew, the crafty bastard! - No, no, no... - No, comrade Hitler. Cheers, gentlemen. Herr Himmlischst... Who is the young lady who visits Shlomo Herzl? Jag does not understand me at the world longer, Mr. Hitler. Such a charming, innocent girl. Do you know her? Our dear Miss Gretchen. So young and already an orphan. Like me. - The old jew has bewitched her. - There is no other explanation. It is unnatural! "The black-haired jew lurking, with a satanic grin on his face- - on the unsuspecting girl as he defiled with his blood- - stealing hence the girl from her people." Take it with Hitler. So you can learn something. Holy shit! Schönerer knows what he's talking about. Cheers to Schönerer! Bowl. Flute high Himmlischst. If you whistle, you can not eat. You may well like raw meat. Why he stands there like a fool? - Who? - Our student. He lubricates the saliva in your hair all day long. It glistens the as a dog purse in the sun. Manager, is the sausage to Pichlers birthday finished? Is the sausage to Pichler finished?! Getting into the swing, you slut! - I dress not for you. - What do you think about me, Gretchen? - They wanted the paint me as Eva. - Yes, but not naked. Adam and Eve were naked when they were expelled from paradise. I will produce subject allegorical. I serAdam and Eve as Aryans- - who gave their blood purity and therefore had to leave paradise. So they went to the grounds of race mixing. Do you understand? Not a cock. Animals mate only with others of the same species. Chickadees with tits, finches with finches. Stork valve with stork hen. Voles with voles, house mice with house mice. Ulvehan with ulvehun. "Voles with voles and house mice in house mice?" Yes, I am with. - They will blow me away. - What? Pule, fuck, fuck... And the job's done. Forget it, you're not my type. I have also menses now... ... As you can see. Were dressed by the Shlomo Herzl. They have spied on me. Do you know who you stripped for? For those who murdered Jesus Christ! Good evening, Miss Gretchen. Come over to our table. - I'm actually meeting someone. - Just stay for a waltz. Take my chair. Do you know these men? Bible... merry verses and romantic hymns. Six days shalt thou labor, but the seventh day is the Lord's. Since you do not need perform any work. No... When you invite your girl out- - drink some good and swearing at the Emperor! This is no waltz. German boys and girls, do not forget that you are German! - Dance only German dance! - Play a march for them. Dance not with him, Miss Gretchen! We go. The new week will not wait! And not me! Himmlischst! - Is there something wrong? - Everything! Wagner was right. Everything is Jews and cyclists errors. What do you have against cyclists? See where your best shoes for the audition. I would fix them, but in the darkness I came to take brown shoe polish. - Now looks like the chicken shit! - Quiet... - Go to hell. - Breathe deeply. Cover the brown with black ink; then shoes like new. - Why I left Braunau am Inn? - Yes, why? Everywhere shit, stench and mockery. Vienna... a melting pot of scum! - Where are my pants? - Here. I advise you to take a cup of coffee and relax. And then you wash yourself. This is important. I'll afknappen- - So you do not come to the academy with open fly. Look around you. I know that you were spoiled as your mother's little darling. But think just a little over sock in the coffee pot. I clean up after yourself this one time. From tomorrow need to do this. Richard Wagner was also artist- - but he did not display socks in the coffee pot. How do I look? - Do you have a mustache? - Do you mind? You look like females. They are not well-liked here. You at the art academy is notorious patriots. You know what is at stake. I let it grow, and it grew. All great men have been shaven. Come here. Yes... It's probably best, I aback a little. I warn you, jew. You be quiet. Even Jesus Christ had a cleft lip during the mustache. Jew... I appreciate on your helpfulness. When my time comes, you will get a suitable reward. When you are really old, I find a good solution for you. Where have you been fine. I have to go to art school and take the test. I keep my fingers crossed for you. A bright future awaits us. I'll arrange for you. A German girl should not work. - They're completely barmy in the lid. - I mean it, Miss Gretchen. I will marry you. My reputation as an artist to radiation from mountain where I build our home. No stranger to set foot there. Not even Shlomo...? Especially not him. Forget it if so. I love Schlomo. No one tells stories like him. Waiting for Hitler? Your kindness toward the artist borders on masochism. Go to hell. This is the Academy... The Almighty eyes contemplating hospitality as heavy as... ... Service. The law is my light, but him... ... Yokel does not easy for me to follow it. Yes, he is lazy... ... Sleep all day and exploit me. God needs man, and it makes man too. But you lost some of your humanity - - since you started playing mother for him the artist. I'm worried about you. Gruber, Martin. Hartl, Johann. Hillenbrand, Karl. Hi... Where was I? - Hitler, Adolf. - Tack. Hitler, Adolf. - Where is he? - Here! Yes, but here he does not exist. Hillenbrand, Karl. Hiller, Eduard. Kronenberg, August... May, Karl. Nepomuk, Hans. Obonja, Walter. I'm nervous for him. He's just a child. I recognize a possible suicide when I see one. - What's wrong with you? - My life no longer has meaning. - What happened? - Nobody loves me. I do then. Do you hear? I love you. Come on. Insensitive monster! - Did it go completely awry? - Crooked?! It struck down by a bolt from clear skies and shot me into the ground. - I was not busy. - Why not? Why? That I did not ask. He fears my talent, that guy Baron von Kropf... or Tropf. No, von Topf. Do you know him? Are you his father? Yes. - Why did Hitler himself? - The boy is shy. Hitler, Adolf. Birth 20 april 1889. ... In Braunau am Inn, Upper Austria. German. Catholic. Father official in the Crown service. Well... I am retired. It says: "Few heads". Result: Draw Sample overruled. The decision taken unanimously. Show me your work samples. Hopelessly, young man. It was the second time. Husmaler? So, I would rather die! What's wrong with that? Traitor! - What? - Dagger in my back. A worldwide association severe tion between Sion's ancestors. You are in league with von Kropf... It's a plot to prevent my ascent to fame! I should have known better, but I had no idea. You and what pigs to a baron got it good, jew! You betrayed my trust. You pretended to be my father and thus deserted... ... In solid ranks. Silence, Adolf. It's late. Soon flutter Hitler tab Over every street bondage items only... Up, up, folks. Lord has created the day all of you. - Do not be so sure of it. - The Princess is also up from the pea. Look here, Gretchen. So you can learn something. Such is life. Some butcher and others are slaughtered. Or what, chief? Look, it's completely quiet. Do you know what the headmaster said, when I asked for an explanation? My drawings showed to my endowment- - was not within painting but in architecture. He would not believe that I never had studied architecture. But Hitler... I was there. You should never be allowed to paint more than a wall. Do you spoil everything?! I saw myself as a builder. In Berlin has launched an competition for a new opera house. Yes, but then you have to first have a university degree. Only dead fish swim with the stream . What do you write? It's not your business. - This is my fight! - You write about me! I break your neck if anyone academy hear about my downfall. You can be completely calm. I will not tell anyone. Shlomo... I'm hungry and I totally flat. - Can you maybe...? - No, Hitler. You have to work and earn a living like everyone else. Or even beg. Do not ride on people. I know what you're doing. You will seduce the pure innocent Gretchen. Therefore, you will of me. No way! Look... a bird. She'll keep you warm during the winter. - Do you write about Jesus in the book? - Yes, that too. - And what are you writing about him? - That I love him. - Why did you kill him then? - Me? Who has claimed that? Stop! Stand still! Hitler is still young and stupid. Take him seriously. - And the evangelists? - Gossip aunts. What do they know? Nothing. They were not there, but I was. Tell me more, even if you're lying. Course. Even as a child was I get the best liar in Budapest. I tell now my most famous lie. It saved my father's soul. This happened in 1848 in Budapest, when the Cossacks invaded the city. They killed all what moved. Small as I was, I hid in a barrel and then everything. A Cossack swung his saber and drive my mother into a corner behind the house. He was just delivering the fatal blow - - when my father came running out, peeled Cossack out of the saddle- - and threw him against the wall. Cossack was dead. My father helped my mother up, picked me up aftønden- - and we fell happy each other around his neck. None of it is true. The truth is that my father had storms Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Petersburg - to crush the evil Zars head against the marble wall. Yes... My brothers believed me and informed the gendarmerie. They interrogated me and I told the truth. Gendarmes dragged my father to station and forced him to interrogation. I sat opposite him with a cup of hot chocolate. Gendarmes said: "Now tell about assassination plans against the Czar- - like your son has told me about." My father looked calm at gendarmes and said: "Yes, the kid is telling the truth." "And when the Czar is not here, I crush your heads against the wall." He got up and threw himself of gendarmes. A whole horde gendarmes stormed into... ... And beat my dad in front of me. I saw how... I saw him lying as a small bundle in the corner... ... And tried to protect its broken spectacles against cudgel estimates. Blood ran from his bald head. So the soul left him. How it happened when his father died for his son for a change. Gretchen! I would like to poison them like monsters. - Exterminate them. - What should we live by, slughals? You are using brain the cow uses its tail. - What day is it today? - No. - Not again, boss. - Get in there. And wash you properly. Grete! Come on down, you slut! Help a poor cripple. Thanks . Help a cripple, a victim of bureaucracy. Mom, why he has only one leg? Hans! When I get hold of you, I'll kill you! Due shiksen? No, no, Lobkowitz. I cried because you played so beautifully. - You played as God Himself. - You think you are Shlomo Herzl. And I think that I am God. We can have the right both. Help a cripple, as defenders of the fatherland. - Help. - So young and too lazy to work... Good day, Mr. Hitler. Why are the staring into the hat? They know well that you are behind rent? I anxiously await. Why so strict? Herr Hitler will soon be getting a scholarship. A scholarship...? Yes, ma'am. As orphaned you are entitled to it. - I'll pay you back with interest. - I hope so! Come, we must go and confess. Get your head up, son. Even begging you have to learn. Believe me, it's not for you. Why do not you do something as you are good at? Why not paint postcards as souvenirs? I could sell them, and we share the profits. You are crying. Nonsense! Never! At my mother's funeral I tried, but no tears came. It does not help to try. Genuine tears felled at night. How touching. Can you show me how to cry? Think of something sad. Your late mother, for example? Close your eyes, Hitler, and imagine she lies dead in the coffin. What do you see? - I look her dead in the coffin. - What is she wearing? - A dirndl. - Stop giggling. - How does her face look like? - As cheese. - Can you see her now? - Yes. Say something to her. Something you've always wanted to say. You never noticed when I was lying. You never noticed that I stole money from your handbag. You never knew that I looked at you through the keyhole when you bathe. You reckon that I'm stupid. You think you are my superior, an honorable arias. With your flattery are you trying to lure my healthy soul in spoilage. You're just a bloodsucker on people's healthy body. Between your nebulous phrases shows Judaism's grinning face him. Good day, Miss Gretchen. Your new blouse dress you fine. I know what you are looking at. Are not in art school today? Today I work outdoors and picturesque St. Petersburg. Michael's church. Do you understand? Do you believe it? See here, Mr. Hitler. This should they paint. Enjoy the architecture. Soak the wonderful Baroque in you. Here is the famous plague monument and the holy Sebastian with arrows. Vienna... rolling along, art and the magnificent buildings city. While you as a young person ought understand what is about to happen. The ongoing battle is important. The unique Germanic culture struggles for survival... ... Like the Greeks and Romans did . See, what a coincidence: "corn at dusk." It's your image. You may be an accomplished painter whose Their pictures already exhibited. First, I would not sell it- - but Mr. Rosenthal prayed so hard I could not say no. I could of course have required more than 50 pounds. Great. They can paint a new one. I would never paint the same picture twice. Only peddle do it. - The Lord is enough painter. - Yes, and a good one at that. Herr Hitler studying Academy of Fine Arts. My husband was duped into buying the here for 2 crowns of Shlomo Herzl. I'm sorry if I wounded your good taste. - How many have you sold? - They go like hot cakes. - Today I sold twenty. - How many? - 15 .. - So not a single one. The young Hitler is stubborn. Only churches. I looked forward to see you draw outdoors. Now draw the churches of the postcard. I had been able to do. I do not go up in churches. It's only a livelihood. Shlomo sell them and I can pay the rent. I thought you painted the church to art school. Do the old churl told anything about me? No, why? - Tell the truth, Miss Gretchen. - They behave comical Hitler. I wish you only the best. - I do not really... - So he told all about me? No, he told only a very sad story. He and his endless stories! The vile creature has spun a web around on you and you're not getting out of it. Jew has defiled you with its stories, so they are dependent afham. I'm young, but not stupid. Are caring for the boy as whether he was the son you never had. He's not even grateful. - I'm sorry, but how does it feel? - What? - To die. - As if you did not know it. You start dying the day we are born . Each flake of flaking skin - each lost hair, every forgotten name- - is a little death every day. The big one is not so dissimilar to it. Do not fight it, but give after. - Does it hurt? - It's more like being born. Do not you resistance is easy. They just slides into another time. And when the action gets to me? There is a time where you go, and a time to dance. I do not work alphabetically. I have no Herzl today. You come with me anyway? I have a surprise for you. I beg your pardon...? They might see the great Wagner opera "Rienzi" with me? Do you believe it? Do you really take me to the opera? On one condition: You must promise me not to visit Shlomo. Only to prove that are not dependent afham. You promise that? Lobkowitz... My goodness... Who and how many was it? - 99 - Why 99? If I say 100, do you think I am exaggerating. See what those bastards did. Love your enemy as yourself. Come, Lobkowitz. I'll help you. Himmlischst! Out with you, you rats! Wake up, Hitler. It's late. And the Sabbath. Yesterday I sold a few of your images. Here's your share. Go for a walk or something. I'm expecting a visit. Was that all? How many did you sell? - Three. - You're lying. - A. - Why did you give me so 3 crowns? Because I want of you. Dress up and get out. Yes. I'll be gone, when the lady comes. If she comes. - What does that mean? - Shlomo, what does "fellatio"? Here you go... and have it go well. Shlomo, between us... - Is it with intercourse true? - What do you mean by that? Pastoradjunkten in Linz said it is. What? He told me to be careful, in Vienna they do it. Do what...? You know what I mean. Men and women... As dogs. Not like dogs, Adolf. Not in Vienna. Call me Adolf again, and I'll break your neck you. Is it nice? Yes, often. Population grows Adolf. - It is a sin. - No. Man's joy delights God. In small doses. In Braunau am Inn I saw a woman on a summer. She wiped her naked buttocks... At dusk. She lifted one leg and I saw her crotch. It was black as night. Where is Gretchen of Shlomo? - You know why she did not come? - No. You're a lousy actor. You should go into politics. - Really? - Yes. But you need to improve grammar and go on a course in rhetoric. Masses are as a woman. You need to flatter them and offer them what they want. So they are amenable to you. Bible... the greatest masterpiece through the ages! Just look at these wonderful, unique illustrations. Here the Jews escape from Egypt, chased by Pharaoh's army... Here you can see it clearly. Here divided the Red Sea waters as Jews rescued- - and their pursuers overthrown in curse- - in perpetuity. 30,000 Egyptians on the way to hell. Creation of the world... ... And doom, it all in one volume. Here you can learn how avoids the time. For only 1.50. In Vienna, the poor craftsman beg Saturday afternoon... ... To work with your hands. And from whom? At a Jewish furniture dealer! I saw him throw it in trash in the slaughter house. Now you're full of shit again. Fill bucket! Larger part of the press in Jewish hands. Big business is in Jewish hands. And the Jews engaged in terrorism which could not be worse. Come on. Why are you shaking your way? Do not look so stupid. ... To liberate the people from Jewish power. You are a donkey, Shlomo. Am I an ass because I'm your friend or your friend fordijeg is a donkey? Me fooling you. Artist steals your shikse and you Remains hose at your bosom. ... Holding this country, created afjøderne. Let us embark on them, mates... I want to marry you. Mitry as an artist to radiation from the mountain where I built our house. You're right, Lobkowitz. I am a fucking donkey. It deserves I, an ugly old man who have fallen in love with a child. Do not die now. I am proud of you, Miss Gretchen. - Kiss your hand rather than licking it. - Nonsense. They have earned this evening. They give me great joy. They are a strong, stately girl who keep their word... a true German virtue. Cola Rienzi... As a bright light rays he- - among his degenerate people, as his liberator and savior. - A beautiful and tragic story. - Wear the fish in now. What happened to him? He was overthrown and killed of his own people. Why? Because mob never understand a genius nature. Wow! Herr Hitler... In art stamp has sacred silence! Select me to protect By the law that is given all So sku back toward fathers And Appoint me to the tribune of the people Rienzi you be praised and glory be to your name You are garlanded with laurels Blessed be thy people As long as Rome is The end of the world Do your name not die You Peace great hero Rienzi, blessed be you And glory be your name = = You are garlanded with laurels Blessed be thy people As long as Rome is The end of the world Do your name not die You Peace great hero How are you, Gretchen? - Are you still mad at me, Shlomo? - I? Why does the Jews always with a question? Why should we not respond to that question? I missed you, my dove. - I am ashamed. - You do not do. - Now, write it in your book. - What? That I betrayed you. As Judas betrayed Christ. But we Jews do not believe in the New Testament. Hitler, this is kitsch. And the worst kind. But here you like. "How to get power over others... Success guaranteed." Close your eyes. Now I count to ten. A: Their main becomes easier and easier. Two: Your breathing becomes slower and slower. Three: Your arms become heavier and heavier. - Fire: The brands do not... - I do not want to be a painter anymore. It was just a tactical ploy to fools. I want something completely different. - Such as...? - Worldwide. The whole world...? Yes... England with all its gay. And Russia with its musicians. I want everything! Be sensible, Adolf. Think of how different all people. Nonsense. I would stand there with a giant whip- - and drive all these people to the end of the world. They must be tightly assembled in a neat row along the edge. Earth is round, Adolf. - It has no end. And no edge. - We need change! Everyone should hang from the earth's edge - Until I stepped on their fingers, and falls screaming down. What do you think? If you so much as reveal a word of our conversations in your book- - then you will die, jude! So I speak no more with you. Even when I let your ashes spread by the wind. Life is an incurable disease... Coffee...? Coffee kills brain cells and allow varicose veins. I must say that I admire your courage. This is what I know like about Vienna: nicotine hanging in the lounges and cafés. - They write a book, right? - Yes, I'm trying. - What's it about? - About you. - What's the book? - "My struggle". With the death? Who will win? - Love. - Is love stronger than death? I've never heard. Excuse me. Watch Ringer. I have an appointment. A man from Waldviertel. His love was shown not strong enough . Nice to talk to you, gentlemen. It's not a good idea. Hello! Watch Ringer. Well, my little fat boy. Wow. Watch Ringer. Close your eyes. Now I count to ten. A: Their main becomes easier and easier. Two: Your breathing becomes slower and slower. Three: They can no longer brand feet. Your hair, Gretchen... ... Driver of healthy feelings of the people. Be wary from now on and forever- - Against all attempts on race pollution. - Especially against the Jew Shlomo. - I'll take care of. Away! Swear that you never will visit Jew Shlomo. " I swear. And now... Dress of. Where is Schlomo? - You must have a real woman. - With big boobs. - And a juicy pussy. - Someone who knows how to do. Friends, I could stay in a pussy, if I just had my snaps. - And friends to shoot rats. - Cursed good idea. match starts, comrades. From today we shoot on something else entirely. We must organize ourselves against the Jewish conspiracy. We founds the pangermanske civil protection. - Exactly! Hail victory! - Sieg Heil! Mod parasites! - Does the old really death? - It's a female. Or is she such a Danube blunder niks like yourself? She is what she says. Just like me. This crazed city is full of people like are not what they pretend to be. But who is it? - Lobkowitz, I'm afraid. - I warned you. You disappoint me, Herzl. I invited you and you stole from me. And just to save your own miserable life. Should love be stronger than me? When it really counts, shit the pants. You thought that you were immortal if you let the cards disappear? It was not my card. - Where was it? - I can not say. Hit it. It's gone! Hitler? - Yes. - They can not love the rabble? No one, not even your friend here, can not stand him. The scripture says: Love your enemy as yourself. And Hitler is not even my enemy. He's just very young... and stupid. I do not know what will become of him. Maybe he is righteous. And maybe it's my job to make sure he gets it. And if he becomes a criminal? So is the accomplice. But why not try? "Tomorrow" is another word for hope. Good. They have extended Hitler miserable life for a few days. - Is this what you wanted? - It may be the whole point, yes. To persuade and slow death. Are you sure you will save them there? The next time there is not only salt in the locker! Fucking monster. What was that "fellatio" was? - Have you swept the floor? - No. Stopped my socks? Street my pants? Have you read "Völkischer Beobachter"? Yes. The Jews transforms every little fart to a sermon. Barber me. You wasted my humanity. I'm not a butler or nanny. Pull yourself together, or you're out. In the last week you have assigned you some of the worst habits- - both the German and Jewish. If you do not want to work, you can at least learn to wipe your ass- - something your mother clearly has taught you. Careful otherwise you will end up as dinner. If you throw the holy bible against my beloved bird again... ... I cut your pagan neck! - Certainly. At least we know where we stand. I thought we were friends. - One more step and I stifle it. - No, I beg you. - You win. - The cup is full, jew. Request sins. Away with your hands! One, two, three... Himmlischst! It will never happen again, Mitzi. I promise. I throw the monster out. The accused suspected to have... ... Acted immoral and antisocial- - against the minor victim. He accused herewith... Distinguished fellow citizens... - Poor child. - Totally helpless. Unscrupulous! And raceskænding. And the offender's name? How shall it be me? Bad. I treated young Hitler as my own son. - It could be worse. - How so? - He distorted Gretchen's head. - It could be much worse. What do you mean? Boy I saw as a son throw me in jail! He seduces the girl I love and forcing her to testify against me. - Say how it could be worse! - It could have happened to me. Eat something first. A young hvedegiffel with butter, apricot jam- - linden flower honey, orange juice - two fried eggs and café au lait au lit. Here you go, gentlemen. What do you of me? Work as chief has finished. Without a doubt a masterpiece book that you gave birth. - Where is it? - What? - Your masterpiece. - "My struggle". It is not finished. If everything goes well, what I question is the maybe readable in a few months. - Shlomo... - Yes? Where is it? You mean the one where it says that your thighs are like jewels... ... And your breasts as cups, where the sweetest milk flowing. Do your dad stick his stinking cock- - in your rotten mother's imperial pussy! Where is it?! Quiet, Gretchen. Girl is impatient. - Let me explain Shlomo... - Jews like explanations. It would be easier, if you gave us the book. We will study your masterpiece before leaving it to posterity. I followed your advice and became a politician. As the bear now has chosen me to a life in the public- - I must protect my reputation and avoid false impression. In your so-called diary is one or two hints... - Ten! ... Which I find offensive. In your inimitable prose describes some of my inadequacies. History falsification is a legitimate ploy. But in my case, at the beginning of my new career - can lead to misunderstanding among masses whose support I need. Do not misunderstand me. It is not to censor your masterpiece. However, if you would be so kind let's look at the script- - We think it might need to make a few remarks- - to, if required, correct one or two... - 20! ... Wrong impression. Where is the damn book?! Why do not you give the book to beast, then he will be satisfied? Hitler will never be satisfied. So get the whole an unhappy ending. "... And then they lived happily of their lives." - Where are you going? - To Germany with Hitler and the others. We are already over 40 Our struggle to spread like wildfire. Protector is funded of many venerable people. - People who want to order. - You're not going anywhere. Otherwise I report you to the police for your little boys. Then we will see who is children scold here. Head... From today we turn back, comrades. We need to find the book before we go to go and smoke the rats out! We turn every stone! Finally, some who cleans out in the pigsty! And if he saved it in colon prygler we it out afham. Pack your things. You can go. You can thank Mr Hitler and his fiancee. Good people. He persuaded the young Franz to withdraw the charges against you But børneskændere like you not like here. Come on. Come here. I have heard that you, after all the book, my good Herzl. Sin. "My struggle" is a good title. I ate it. If the book is gone, is the problem away. - Not at all. - Why not? You are the problem. The book is inside your head. What should I do to you, Shlomo? Had you had a nice tattoo could we have done a lampshade of you. It was a joke. I'll take you to Munich as a good-luck charm. A little stores before the journey can not hurt. The game is over, Hitler. Down there. Finita la commedia. Did you hear that? Idiots. One will be to God, the second death. And the third love me. This is laughable. We need to teach death craftsmanship. This is the start of a wonderful friendship. Himmlischst, grab them! Now it's time to say goodbye. Efterfem years of misery in this corrupt city... Five years of wear... Stop! Stop them! Now you need to get a joke. Two men hanging on the cross. The one groan. The second asks: "Does it hurt?" "Only when I laugh." But I thank you for the sufferings of Vienna has given me my people back - and because I have learned to distinguish - between the victim and the perpetrator! Heinrich, you are a loser! Where are you? Himmlischst! You are an incorrigible optimist. Set up personal hygiene. Now! People laughed at me because I was a prophet. In two rows in the yard. Of the many who laughed at the time there are many which are not laughing now. Of the many who still clay, many will soon not laugh anymore. Speed on! Last night I dreamed something. Six o'clock woke me with tea, fat and rusks. And then breakfast. Four dishes and Kaiserschmarrn. And then lunch. Eight dishes and Kaiserschmarrn. Siesta with cake. Five o'clock: Sandwich and Sachertorte. Dinner: Ten dishes and more Kaiserschmarrn. Supper 10 pm: Beluga caviar and lobster "American Style". Till midnight snack: Warm milk and Mozart balls. And... ... They do not give me permission to fucking.
