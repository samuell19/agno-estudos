So do I. -OK, we'll speak tomorrow. -Bye. What's wrong? Lost your appetite? Of course, with a father like yours. A bum who can't even support his family. -No wonder your mom's on edge. -Leave her alone. Martin turn it down, for God's sake! I'm going back to Montreal. Don't tell Grandma, OK? -It's our little secret. -OK. -You're my favourite uncle. -Yeah. Bye. 88 00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,064 -I'm going to Quebec City. -Drop me at the station?

Like it? Can I try it? How's this? Keep it. You're giving it to me? We found a new place to practise. We're getting good. -Look, here it is. -Yeah? -Hi, Hanna. -Hi, Claudio. The UN Security Council signs a ceasefire agreement forged earlier this week... between Israel and Syria, both accused of aggression. Israel was first to request the emergency Council meeting, stating it has been repeatedly attacked since July 13... Can I have the bread? Why must you aways talk during the news? That's funny? What do you know of the land or our ancestors? That's enough. How can you deny your roots? Damn gentiles... ...Christian grandmother, family of Mongols... Leave them be. Can't we eat in peace? I'm going to bed. -Close the door! -Fine! Don't listen to Dad. Your bother's not so retarded. I like him a lot. We have fun together. I went swimming every day. I pretended it was the sea, the waves carried me away. You know, Mom... I'm sick too... like you. Go to bed, dear. Sleep well. We'll cut that tomorrow. Short hair's better, hm? If you cut it regularly, it gets thicker, stronger. Don't be afraid to cut it. It'll strengthen the roots. You can cut the back. It's neater. Looks good eh? To your book! Know why I'm wearing a hat? Why? Didn't you notice? My hair's ugly! Your hair's fine, Hanna. Stop pouting. Don't ruin a lovely day. I'm so happy. Hanna? Hanna! That's not funny! Not at all! Riel, Hanna. Mother's maiden name? Riel. Mother's name, not father's. Riel's my mother's name. Why do you use her name? My parents aren't married. Your father's name? Cohn. David Cohn. Nationality? None. What do you mean? He's not from anywhere. He was Polish, before the war. Polish... Religion: Catholic... No. Jewish. Depending... My father's Jewish, my mother's Catholic. Judaism passes via the mother so I'm not Jewish. For Catholics, it's through the father, so I'm not Catholic either. Personally, I don't care. For the school, we'll put "Catholic". Father's profession? Writer. Writer. He likes the poet, Rilke. Has he been published? Want my mother's profession? Famous fashion designer. That be all, Hanna. Next... Tremblay, Ginette. Mother's maiden name? 271 00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:20,921 Hello, Mom. Why are you here? I brought fudge. No school today? Just registration. Can I stay here? No you can't, come on. Not having any? I've tasted your fudge before. You can't stay here. I won't bother you, we'll go home together. I can't. I have too much work. Not even time to eat? No. Now go on. Go on! One, please. It's true. I don't want more. So get undressed. Why not the mouth? We're always responsible for what we do. And free. I lift my hand, I'm responsible. I turn my head right, I'm responsible. I'm unhappy. I'm responsible. I smoke a cigarette, I'm responsible. I close my eyes, I'm responsible. I may forget I'm responsible, but I am. I am responsible. ...lifted like hair... ...by the wind. ...hair in the wind. ...like hair... in the wind. Period. ...hair in the wind. The silence of a man... who sleeps... A face in the ravaged forest... It'll be good, eh? It's important. Dad s an artist. You're an artist too. My dad says Jews are just self-pitying. Their propaganda's exaggerated. They have something shameful to hide. -Why should I care? -You must have an opinion. What about the concentration camps, the crematoria? But my dad... He was safe and sound in the war. You're so stupid! Takes one to know one. My dad says so. Yeah? Well you're just a damn Jewish bastard. What? Say that again. What you just said is very bad. You shoud apologize. Sorry. Paul's a delivery boy now? Tell him to park that thing somewhere else. The rent cheque bounced again. Tell your father. Can't you borrow from your relatives? I wore this when I met your dad. At the graduation dance. He was friends with my drawing teacher. He had just landed. I was 16. Dad says you followed him. You sat on the stairs in front of his house, waiting all night. Is it true? Get down. That's how Paul was born. Dad never knew Paul was born, 'til I saw him 2 years later, by accident, at a demonstration. I told him. He decided to look after us. Grandma never forgave us for taking Paul. She'd kept him for 2 years. When we went to get him... she cried a lot. Grandma cried? After Martin, Paul consoled her. She always resented your father coming back. She did everything to keep us apart. She always called him a Communist, not knowing what it meant. Did he love you? There. It was very hard afterwards. I was so young. We had no work. I'd just finished training as a decorator in a big store. Dad didn't have his papers so he couldn't work, except under the table. He wasn't very good at odd jobs, so they'd never call back. Now that he works at a paper, can we go on vacation this summer? How about Atlantic City? We'll just be less behind with the rent. We'll see about the rest. Mama... you think Dad has talent? He'll be published and we'll get rich? Turn around. I love velvet dresses. That's fine. Good. You can take it off. I'll fix it now. Mama? What? Nothing. Hello. One, please. Thanks. -Do you mind me looking at you? -Not at all. You seem bored. -What are you doing? -Reading. Buy me a drink? If you wish. Your last composition... the part on responsibility was very good. We liked the same movie? -I've seen it 4 times. -Why does it interest you? Nana determines her own life. She's free. But she dies in the end... tragically. It's good, normal, to be inspired by what you like but... you must find your own words, develop your own ideas about life, about your life. Understand? My life. He's been working here for a month. What's he do? Journalist. Isn't this a newspaper? Just a moment. I'll call Editing. -He only works part-time. -Is there a Mr. Cohn there? He was in Archives but he quit yesterday. -You're his daughter? -No. I went to your office. It didn't work out? Have a seat. Won't be long. I'll finish this. Did you tell Mom? Got any change? No money. Hanna, wake up. I didn't see the time. Mom will worry if we're late. I have to go shopping. Come on! She shouldn't know where you found me. She gets too edgy. Hurry up! "For it is not vanity to say no ones life's their own." Rilke. Hey, poet. She's a prostitute. Hey, poet! What did you say about life? What's he want? I don't know. Don't judge her. In the war a hooker risked her life to hide me. She was exceptional. I know, Dad. I know what you mean. Take a dollar from my pocket and pay. Thank you. A man walking... Can we do this tomorrow? I'm exhausted. I must sleep. A man walking in the shadows... We've revised this 100 times already! It has to be perfect! Forget it! Just look after your kids. They're out of hand. You don't even notice! -Where's your son right now? -As though you cared! You don't care about them or the bills. You can't support a family playing chess. Insect! Pig! Shit! -Schizophrenic! -Let go! Enough! Mama? Open up! I love you. We can leave. We don't have to live with a madman. Open up. Go on to bed. Leave me alone. You don't understand her. You don't love her like I do. Can't you see she's had it? Open the door! I don't want you to die. Why? You can't do that to me. I wish he were dead. He's your father. -You should go apologize. -You still defend him? I love hm. I need him. I'm going to get a drink. I forget I'm responsible, but I am. After all, everything's fine. Beauty's in the eye of the beholder. Things are simply as they are. A face is a face. Plates are plates. Men are men. And life... is life. And life... is life. It's the 20th already! 'Til early next month, as usual. I'll give you a bit more... Yeah, they're precious. -Good day. -You too, Mr. Malkovitch. My mother's always travelling. She's a concert pianist. Do you miss her? I call a lot but... it's like she's becoming a stranger. Like I'm really bothering her. Sorry this is stupid. Not at all. That's the first time you kissed a girl? For me too. You liked it? I only ever kissed my brother. Wait 'til you meet him. He's funny. He makes you laugh. Shall we go? Hanna... I'm sure you'll like her. She has a funny accent. It's her! Laura, this is my brother, Paul. -Were you at Sabastien's party? -Yes. -Are you hungry? -Yes. So does Paul kiss well? Let's spin the bottle. Whoever it points to, chooses. Paul? Or Hanna? Laura. Better than me? He screwed me. I pay for bread, not air. Take it back and ask the idiot for one wthout holes. Hurry up. -They'll think I'm nuts. -Do it. No. That baker's a creep. -You're going! -No, I'm not! How dare you speak to me like that? Open up! Get out here! He wants another one, with no hole. How can I check for that? -My bread doesn't usually have holes. -That one does. What's that, sweetie? Can I have another one? Sure. Just took some out of the oven. Pick it yourself. Come. -Are you alright? -What's wrong? What do you care? Wait for us. Tell us what's wrong! Why should I ? I said, it's nothing. You all know... in the infinitive "to use," the "s" sounds like a "z" and in the noun, "use", the "s" is pronounced normally... Love or be loved? Be loved. Love. Bring me that paper. You have a fever. What's wrong, Hanna? You seem so fragile these days. I've had enough. I'd like to help, but I'm not the right person. Look at me. Look at me when I talk to you. I like you. I love you. Don't mix everything up. Nothing to do? I'm sick. Shouldn't you play in your room? I'm going to do errands. -See you later. -Bye. "The Diary of Anne Frank". I would like you to start reading... and to love books as I do. They're our only true friends. Thanks, Dad. Our teacher already told us about this. She called to see how you were. -Thats all? -Yes. Nice, eh? You'll find this story very moving. You know... Anne Frank was about your age. That's all she said? She'd like to meet us. Move over a bit. You'd never kill yourself, would you? Why do you ask? Answer me. Certainly not. Thats not the story. Anne Frank wanted to live. The Germans killed her. But what about you? I promise. I'll never do that. You know... before I met your mother... -I was married to another woman. -I know. But you dont know what I'm about to say. It was... in France, during the war. Her name was... Erna. She was a ballerina. She was... very beautiful. We loved each other deeply. We didn't know what would happen. We were always afraid. Ever day... friends and relatives were arrested. No one was safe. One night, we made a pact, Erna and I. We swore before God that, whatever happened, we'd never commit suicide. A few days later Erna was arrested. After the war I found out she was deported to Birkenau. But I've never had proof of her death. I try to imagine she too made a new life... that she has children... Mama don't go... Why do you do this to me? Stop it. Stop, she can't hear you. Paul! This can't go on. Call the doctor. -How much for all this? -I see times are tough. Mother's in the hospital. Anything serious? They said it's a rest cure. It's just for a few weeks. Then we'll be back for it. A clock... You don't have to hide. I'm your father... -I've seen you before. -Let me be! Haven't I told you not to slam the door? Would you give us a break? I'm your father. You owe me respect. It's all your fault. You're such a loser! -Don't touch her! -You stay out of it. Get out. -Are you out of your mind? -What did you say? You're sick and you need help. You and your goddamn poems. Paul! Stop it. Dad, stop it! You want the doors open? Is that it? Is that what you want? Well, now you've got it! Come on, let's go. Stay here. Damn maniacs! I'm calling the police! Old bitch! What's going on? -I had a fight with Dad. -We left home. Wait, I'll open the door. Mama, I'm here. It's me. Your daughter. Why don't you ever see me? We're getting out of here. Enough. She's in no condition for this. Yes? Right. Hello? Who is it? Amost 14. Brown. Five foot six. Lucky, stay. Bastard. Doggie... Here, boy. Come. Come here. Here, boy. Yes...I'll keep you. Wait for me. How much? I don't know. You decide. Are you working? Working tonight? Five bucks. Here, Dixie. No dogs. I changed my mind. Wait! Hanna. What's happening to you? Your dad came to school yesterday. He's had no news for 2 days. He loves you. Badly perhaps. Very badly. But he loves you. I'm sure. You should call him right now. I'm not going back. You don't understand. Can't I stay here? Listen, Hanna... there may be a lot I don't understand... you can't destroy yourself like this. Your mother... Maybe she shouldn't know you ran away. Shouldn't know what? What do you know about her? Anyway, nobody cares. Not even her. She hears nothing. Sees nothing. Feels nothing. You're alrght? This is my dog, Dixie. I made "osso bucco". It has everything your body needs. Three carrots, an onion, grade-A meat, tomatoes, celery, bone marrow, rich in iron. It's good for your bones. Good holidays everyone. Are you staying in town? I'm joining Mom at Grandma's in the country. You still like movies? I rarely use this. You can have it 'til September. I've never used one. You'll learn fast, I'm quite sure. Thank you. I forgot to stop it.
