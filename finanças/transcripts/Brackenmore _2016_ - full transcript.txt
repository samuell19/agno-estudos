[suspenseful music] - So how are you feeling? - Good, just tired. - Yeah, tell me about it. Is she all right now? - She's asleep, thank gosh. - Uh-hm. God, she's been such a nightmare. - She doesn't want to leave. - [chuckles] I got that! Jesus, I thought she was going to stab me! - I've never seen her temper get that bad before. I thought it was pretty unusual, even by her standards. - Well, I'm just glad she's asleep now. [whispers] I couldn't handle her being any more of a little bitch. - Uh, John... - Well, you know I'm right. - That's not the point. - All right. Fine. - [screaming] - Christ! What the hell happened to her now? - She can't be awake. Caroline, come on! - All right, John. [yelling] Hey! - Okay, darling, wake up. - [screams] No, no! - Kate, will you wake up [indistinct]. [horn blows] [crash] - [suspenseful music] - [hissing] - [heavy breathing] [door opens] - I heard shouting. Is um... is everything all right? - Yeah. I'm just, um... - Do you want anything? - No. - Do you remember what it was about? - Not clearly. - Did it have to do with the house? Your uncle's house, I mean, not ours. Ever since the letter, you know, you've been agitated. So, I... um... look, if you want to go, I mean, I can come with you. It might help to clear things up a bit. - Hey, I'm still really tired. Can... can we just talk in a bit? - Sure. - Sorry for waking you. [door closes] - Hello. Hello? Hello. - Hello. - Hu-- Hi. Um, I'm looking for a room. - We don't use this door for guests. - Sorry, I-- I don't have a reservation. I just saw the sign on the main road. - Well, I suppose I better show you around. Just through here. - Thank you. - It's not huge, but it's comfortable. Well, I'll leave you to get settled. I was going to do meat stew later, if you'd like. - Thanks. - Perhaps about 8. - Okay. - I'll come and get you. The bathroom's just through there. You may have to leave the water run a bit. Not sure when it was last used, but... - [indistinct]. [answering machine beeps] - Steven, hi. It's me. Um, I guess you're out. Listen. [sighs] I'm so sorry for just leaving without saying anything. And just going so abruptly. You were right though. That was a good idea. I needed to get away from the city and... from everything. I'll, um... I'll be in touch... in a few days. I'll speak soon, okay? I'm really sorry. - Hello. Huh. [metallic clanging] Thank you. Are you saying grace? - Of sorts. - So, my wife tells me you're from London. - [clears throat] Hmmm. Sorry. Yes, I am. - And what brings you to our neck of the woods? - I have some family matters I need to see to, so... - Uh-huh. - My Uncle Liam, he passed away not too long ago. So apparently, some things have fallen to me. - Your uncle? - Apparently. My family passed away when I was younger. - That's unfortunate. - I didn't even know I had an uncle. [chuckles] - So how do you like it? The stew? - Is that a local recipe? - It is. In some form or another. - Hmmm. - Will you be staying for long? - Um, I don't know. Sorry. I'm going to try and see the estate person tomorrow. And, you know, I should... I should know after that. Is that okay? - Uh-hm. - It shouldn't be too long. No more than a few days. [phone rings] Hello. Hello. Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah, I stopped by yesterday. Tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow is good. Okay. All right. Thank you. See you then. Bye. [sighs] [door opens] - Miss Reynolds, we meet at last. - Well then. - I'm here to sort out my... - Your uncle's estate. That's right. Yes. Now I have that... oh, here we are. [clears throat] Uh, were you close? - To be honest until I got your letters, I didn't know I had an uncle. - I didn't have much interaction with the man. He was very private. Liked to keep himself to himself, if you know what I mean. Well, it makes sense at least, hmmm? - What makes sense? - You do know how he died? Oh, sorry. I assumed you knew. I'm afraid he... he took his own life. - Oh. - Sorry. Look, are you okay? - Yeah. - Look, we can arrange to do this another time perhaps. - No. If it's all the same, I would like to do it today. - Today? [stumbling] Yes, okay. That should be no problem. Uh, well, I've just got to check the calendar first. Things have been hectic this winter. Uh... uh... do we take my car? - You okay? You look a little pale. - I just didn't sleep well. - Well, this is it. Here, let me get that for you. It doesn't look like much, but it comes with 13 acres. Mostly woodland. And well, shall we go in? You can see why your uncle liked the place. It's uh... it's quaint. I'll, uh, I'll open up for you. [clears throat] [struggles with door] Ah, this is it. - I recognize this. - Really? Well, I'm not an estate agent obviously, but the house seems to be in good nick. And I don't have the details to hand, but by all accounts, there's a kitchen in there, a bedroom down there, and a fine big adjoining space down the back there that was used for storage. Look, uh, would you like if I, uh, left you alone and you could look at the house in your leisure? - Yeah, thank you. That would be nice. - So, look, I'll leave the keys here. And sure, we can go over the paperwork tomorrow. Ah, Tom! - I just seen the door was open there and thought I'd come in. - Tom, this is Miss Reynolds. Miss Reynolds, this is Tom. - How's it going? - Just showing Miss Reynolds around her uncle's estate. Well, technically now, your estate, I suppose. - Kate. - Well, like I was saying, I'll leave you at it. Are you sure you'll be able to get home on your own? - Yeah. I'll find my way. - Well, I can take you back if you want. - It's okay, honestly. - Maybe it's best if he does. Surely, we don't want you to get lost. Well, uh, I'll see you tomorrow. - That is funny. I recognize this place. I guess I must have been here as a kid. - I knew your uncle actually. - Really? - Uh-hm. He was a good man. Took me in for a while then. - I was born around here but never knew any of the details. I lost my, uh, parents in an accident around here when I was younger, and um, I... - Come on, I'll get you back to the inn. [sighs] [knock on door] - Just a minute. Hello? [insects chirping] [birds chirping] [knock on door] - Tom. Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to check up on you, see how you were doing. - How kind! Thank you. Yeah. A lot better than yesterday. I don't know what happened there. That's so sweet. Did you want to come in? - Oh, uh, I didn't want to invade on your privacy. - No, no! Don't be silly. Honestly, I'll just be a minute. - So, you're feeling better then, yeah? - Yeah. I guess I must have slept it off. But that was really weird. Hey, I'm really sorry about your shirt. - So where are you off to then? - I'm going to go down to the village and see Mr. Kelly. He, uh, mentioned yesterday about going over some paperwork. So, you know, it will be good to know what I'm finally letting myself in for. How about you? What are your plans? I looked at those as well. And they're rather strangely familiar. - Well, you see that man there? - Uh-hm. - That's your uncle. - Really? - Mmmm. A long time ago, obviously. - Where are these from? - Oh these? These are just pictures of people from around the village. Community events and things like that. It's so small everyone basically knows everyone. You might find it strange, but you'll get used to it. - It's so beautiful here. And the village itself, it's really quiet. It's almost out of time. - I like how quiet it is around here. - Mmmm. - Things aren't complicated. Oh, and they're not boring either. At least to the people that live here. - I can understand that. - So, tell me, how are you finding the place? - Until today, I haven't really had a chance to explore. From what I've seen, it's quiet and relaxing. And that's um, that's definitely what I need right now. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I guess things are just sort of complicated at the moment. It doesn't exactly look open. - [sighs] Well, that's annoying. - Listen, if you're not doing anything later... Why don't we go down to the festival that they have going on by the lake? I mean, like it's nothing major, but there'll be lots of people there. It'll give you a better feel of the village. Show you what the village is really like. Aw, come on. It's going to be fun. I'll pick you up at 8. - Eight sounds good. - I'll see you then. - All right. See you. - [on phone] Hello. Your call cannot be taken at the moment. So please leave your message after the tone. [beeps] - Hey, it's me. I've, um, I've not heard from you. I guess it's no surprise really. It's nice here. A little superstitious and kind of in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure you'd really like it anyway, but... It's been interesting. And... and I'm all right. I'm just a little bit under the weather, but I'm just checking in. Hope you're okay. [beeps] - Oh my God! Why wouldn't there be severed heads in the kitchen! - [knock on door] - [startles] - Tom, hey. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I thought we were meeting at 8 though. - Yeah, we were. It's 8:30 now. - Oh God I'm so sorry. I completely lost track of time. I was-- I was looking around and um... Never mind. [crowd chatter] [banjo music playing] [sighs] It wasn't what I was expecting at all, you know? - I'm glad we've got surprises. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I think this is definitely what I've needed, you know. Everyone just looks so happy here. - Hey, come on. I've got an idea. Follow me. Come on. [laughter] Want to try some? - A pipe? - There's more to it than that. It's a local herbal recipe, you know. - Oh! [giggles] Now I know why everyone's so happy here. - You don't have to try it if you don't want to obviously. - I didn't want to stand out more than I already do, do I? [flicks lighter] [laughter] [crowd merrymaking] [choking] [choking] Thank you for tonight. - [whispers] I'm glad you had fun. - I did. I haven't for so long, but... [sighs] Tonight was really good. I should go. - Yeah, you go ahead. - I'll see you soon. - Sleep well. [knock on door] - [door opens] - Hey, Irene, I'm sorry. [choking] [struggling] [groans] - [scream] - [grunts, punches thrown] [choking] [gasping] [heavy breathing] [scream] [heavy breathing] [sobs] [scream] [heavy breathing] [sobs] - Kate, are you ready? - Uh-hm. - You're from London, Miss Duffy? - Yes. - And how long have you been in Brackenmore? - A couple of days. Sorry. I got here on Tuesday. - And how well did you know Allyn Nivonne? - I didn't. - You didn't have any contact with him when you arrived or prior? - No, I didn't know him. - Why are you here in Brackenmore? - My uncle. I'm here to sort out his things. OFFICER: Good man, your uncle. Troubled. Are you troubled, Miss Duffy? - No! - Mmmm. Where were you tonight? - I was at the lunar festival outing. OFFICER: Yes, yes. My men saw you. - So why would you ask where I was? - So you met Allyn at the festival. - No! I don't know him. [emphatically] I didn't meet him. I've not met him. - Tell me about the festival. - We...we...we ate and drank a little. Maybe he saw me there. OFFICER: That was it? You just ate and drank? - And danced, I guess. - Okay. You see, by all accounts, you were a little out of sorts, shall we say. - We... - Smoked a little of the festival root. But you didn't meet Allyn? - No. - And you didn't party with Allyn? And you didn't invite Allyn back to yours, and then things didn't take a turn, and he didn't end up bleeding out on your bedroom floor? - All right now, that's enough now. OFFICER: See? You come over here from London. You come to our quiet little village and you come to our little festival. You drink. You smoke. And then one of our village lads ends up dead. So, you can understand why I'm not going to cradle your head. See, I knew that boy. - What are you looking at? - Old photos of my uncle. Umm. This here. My uncle and my dad when they were kids. This woman here... That's my Mom. [sighs] And this little girl... I think that's me. But-- I don't remember any of it. [sighs] Or anything that's here, and-- and I don't remember them, and it's freaking me out. I can't stay here. [knock on door] - Miss Reynolds. Uh, so, about the property. - I want to sell it. - Well, I'm afraid it's not really that simple. - Why? - Well, you see, we have to determine first if your uncle left any outstanding debts. And well, then after that, there's all the paperwork and then we'll have to make sure that that's all done correctly so it transfers over to you properly. - Isn't that something that you should have started already? - Well, you see, I was waiting to hear from the next of kin... yourself... as how to proceed. - How long is it going to take? - Well, um, I'll have to make a few inquiries first. And like I say if there's nothing outstanding a few days. And well, if there is, it-- it might take a little longer. But you'll be the first to know. - Yeah. Of course, I will. [sighs] [birds chirping] Come on. Answer it. [sighs] [door opens] [sighs] Hey. Sorry about that. - There's no need for you to be sorry. I understand that. - Can you take me back to the guest house, please. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - I just want to get my things. - Are you sure about this? - Yeah. [***] Irene! [shouting] Irene! [***] - [message from Steven] Hi. I got your messages. I'm really worried about you. Anyway, I'm here. I arrived this morning. Where are you? Look, Kate, I found the pregnancy test. I wish you'd told me. I mean, this is a good thing, you know. We can start fresh. Look, please just call me. We need to talk. - Can I help you? - I'm uh...well, I'm looking for a place to stay. This, uh, this is the guest house, right? - No. - Oh, oh. Well, it's just, um... I mean, the sign on the street back there, it points this way. - It was. It isn't anymore. The sign is old. - Right. Well, um, I mean, do you know of anywhere else in town I could stay? - No. - Right. Well, thanks. You've, uh, you've been a lot of help. KATE: This was meant to be stress-free. Meant to be a break from all the other shit. Sorry. TOM: No, that's fine. - God knows what he's doing. [sighs] Or who. And he's sorry. I know he is, but... It's not enough, you know? 'Cause he did cheat, and he messed up. He was trying really hard. The more he tries, the more I hate him. [sighs] Oh, it just makes me feel guilty because he's trying so hard. - You know it's not good to feel guilty now. - I know. But I do. I just can't forgive him. [sighs] There's no way I'm strong enough. - Oh, come on. After everything you've been through? I've never met anyone stronger. - I'm not strong. - Yes, you are. More than you know. [***] Okay. Change of plan. You're going to have a drink. I know I want one, and you sure as fucking need one! - [giggles] Okay. [sighs] Did you find anything? Tom? [buzzing] [***] [buzzing] Tom? No, no! [struggling] [screams] No, no! [screams] [sobs] - I'm sorry, Kate. I really am. - These must appear very strange to you, these death masks. - Tom, I'm scared... and I don't want to be here. Tom, I want to leave. - There's a lot of things you don't understand about our traditions. Things that outsiders would call pagan. - I want to leave. - I won't say anything. - It's all relative, I suppose. - I promise. - Some people have lost their way. - I want to put this all behind me. - They have lost sight of what's important. - I don't want to be a part... - Family. - ...of this anymore. - You're not just part of this. You're the whole of it. This is all about you. - Okay. Please, let me go. Please. IRENE: There is no one more important than you. No one. You've just forgotten. - Forgotten what? IRENE: Your role here. You've seen it in those pictures. MAN: Many people would call it superstition... But they don't know what's coming. We do. - And you do too. You've seen it. - You were chosen a long time ago. - You don't even know me. - I do. I was there the night of the crash. - [sighs] What are you talking about? - Your uncle, he understood what needed to be done. That's why there was no way out of the crash. You knew they were about to leave and you wouldn't let them. Your uncle sacrificed himself so that you may return here. But you have forgotten everything. - [shouting] This is insane! - Believe me, it's not. [scream] - We are the messengers. You have the mark. You'll pretend that you haven't it, but I know that you do. Unfortunately, you have forgotten its significance. You have forgotten your part. That is why Allyn went to your room. He was a true believer. - He did what needed to be done. MAN: He was ready to lay down his life to bring that part of you out. - If you hadn't run away, you'd have welcomed this. You'd have been willing. You'd have been revered like all those before you. But that's just not going to happen, is it? I'm sorry. This is not going to be pleasant for you. - [screams loudly] Somebody! [sobs] [choking] [screams] - Hello. - Oh, hi there. Um, um... - Come in. Come in, come in! - Okay. Sure. Thanks. - So, how might I help you? - Well, um, yeah. I was wondering if you could help me. Actually, I'm looking for my wife Kate. Kate Reynolds. I think she stopped by here. - Kate Reynolds? Sorry, that name doesn't sound familiar. - I mean, it's just... we... we got this letter from you about the passing of her uncle's estate. - Oh! [stammering] Yes. Yes, this lady called in, but I wouldn't know where she is now. - Oh, well, do you think she might be at her uncle's place? - Oh, no. She wouldn't be there. Sure, I have the keys, and she wouldn't be there. - All the same, do you think I could grab the address? It's just that I'd like to visit... - I'm sorry. I can't give out that kind of information. - But I'm her husband. - [sighs] All the same. - I mean, I... I could just look it up, you know. - Well, if you think it might help. - No, it really would help if you... if you could just give me the address. - Look, perhaps you should ring her up. Maybe that might be the right thing to do. - Yes. She's not picking up her phone. - Ah! Well, sorry sir. I can't help you. - Well, is there no one who's at least seen her arrive and... - Mr. Reynolds. - Hello. - My name is Superintendent Garrett, and I'm in charge of the local police force around here. I'm sorry to have to tell you that your wife has been involved in an incident which has resulted in the death of a young man in the village. - I'm sorry, what? - It would appear that Ms. Duffy has fled the community. - No, no. There must be some sort of mistake. My wife's name is Reynolds. - No, no. I'm afraid there is no mistake, and I have to ask you if you have any knowledge of her whereabouts. - Well, no, I don't know where Kate is. That's the thing. I'm here looking for her. She's not picking up her phone or anything... - Has there been anything going on between you that could have resulted in this outburst? - Excuse me? - Has there been anything going on between you that could have resulted in this outburst? An affair maybe? - Look, I... I don't know who you are or what you... What the...? Where did you um... how did you get... What the fuck is going on here? - Steven! Welcome to Brackenmore. - How are you doing? Kate, look at me. Do I look dead inside to you? You're my sister. I've waited to see you my whole life. I never asked for us to be separated. All I ever wanted was for us to be family again. I know none of this makes any sense to you, I know. I really am sorry for this. [door opens] - [heavy breathing] No! No, no, no, no! [shouting] Don't do this! You want me, take me, but please leave him out of this. I'll be whoever you need me to be. Just please leave him alone! [sobs] Just please leave him alone. [sobs] No! - I wish I didn't have to do this, Kate. - [sobs] Please don't! Please don't do this! You don't have to do this! You...you're the one that's in control. Tom, Tom! No! [scream] No! [scream] Tom! [stiffled screams] [sobs] I love you so much! - [stiffled] Fuck you! Fuck you! - [sobs] I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please! - [stiffled] Fuck you! [silent screams] [mouthing] I'm so sorry! MAN: We are gathered here, a desperate lot, with nowhere else to turn. We stand on the precipice of a new world. She will bring new life. She will bring new prosperity and protection in a world that is forgotten. When we were chosen for this path, chosen long before you and I were born, in the days of the old gods. And we must never forget what we have sacrificed to usher in this new world. I am not unaware of where these actions may take me after I die, but that does not matter. What matters is that we have the strength within ourselves to do what we must. To know that this is the right way, the only way. Today is a dark day, and we must never forget what we have sacrificed here today to usher in this new world. - [sobs] [gasp] [heavy breathing] - Neela. New prosperity. New life. - Forgive me. - It is done. - Christ! No! No! [shouting] Help me! For the love of God, please. Help me, please! [scream] [screams] - Stop it! Stop it! - This thing. It's a part of me, and it's protected me my entire life. [screams] [***] [music fades out]
