We're gonna be going in a different direction. Pack up your things, Joe. We're going in a different direction. So? Change much? It's smaller. Hey, Joey! Gotcha! Surprise, Joey! Surprise! Well, hey.

You gotta bat Boggs leadoff. It don't matter who bats leadoff. What you need is more pitching. Now. Who you got after Cone? I'm just about getting into it, but I think we got a pretty solid staff. Joey, the man canned Billy Martin 12 times. Bob Lemon. Lou Piniella-- He fires everybody! It's his team, I guess he can do what he wants. Joey! Do you and Ali have a place to live yet? Well, she's starting to look. You buying or renting? Buying? You'll be out of here by August! Joey, rent. I'm not interested in honorable finishes, or close seconds. This is New York!

If there's anything you need, you let me know, or you let Bob know. All you got to do is win. That's what I came here to do, George. Fine. Fine. I've been divorced twice and fired three times.

What do you think I want to talk about? The one thing I'll give George credit for, maybe he drives people crazy, but the man don't sit still for losers! He's giving Torre a shot, fine. But unless he delivers-- [Announcer] Tony from Tenafly. You're on the air. [Tony from Tenafly] Hey, I'm happy for Joe, right? He's a New York guy, he's got a new baby, great! I give him April, I give him May. By June he's gone. Baby or no baby. End of story. She's beautiful, Dad. She's beautiful. Yeah, Joe, Joe! You didn't win with the Mets, you didn't win with the Braves. You didn't win with the Cardinals. What's different now? This time it's the Yankees. [laughter] Next month, I'm gonna be 65. I think that had a lot to do with it. Sixty-four years old, and I never earned a nickel in all those years that didn't come from baseball. When I was a kid, I didn't have a paper route, anything like that. I was playing ball. Day after I graduated, I went to play A Ball. Seventeen, I was playing professional ball. [laughs] You know, I can tell you what I did... every 4th of July from 1948 to 1995. I was at a ball game! [snickers] Every Memorial Day: at a ball game. Every Labor Day: at a ball game. At a ball game! At a ball game! So what happened? Why'd you quit? Too many ball games. [laughs] Well, how do you feel about it? You sorry you quit? Well, am I sorry I quit? The last six months have been heaven! Last six months have been heaven. [laughs] Because if you're interested in some more ball games... I'd like to hire you as my bench coach. All right, wait a minute. Did George put you up to this? Don, this is my idea. Well, it's a damn good idea. Great. Good. Well, guess what, ladies? You know, when I think about it, it's really kind of amazing. My second season with Milwaukee, what happens? I make it to the World Series. Took it for granted. I said, "Well, this is the way it's supposed to be." Easiest thing in the world, right? Yeah! I was arrogant. What the hell did I know, that most Major Leaguers never get a shot like that? I waited all my life for that. That's what I'm sayin'. What? Joey... You're gonna do it. I won a batting title once. Most Valuable Player once. But when you're an athlete, you play to win. Win. In baseball, that means the World Series. I played 2,209 baseball games, and never made it to the World Series. I managed 1,901 games, and never made it to the World Series. I played 18 years as a player, 19 years as a manager, never made it to the World Series. Some guy looked it up, and it turns out that I'm the one who spent more days in a baseball uniform than anyone else in the history of the game... who never made it to the World Series. Now, how the hell would you like to have that on your epitaph? [softly] You know, this is not just some kid with a couple years, that's your boy-- this is Dwight Gooden, skipper. Dwight Gooden! Yeah, I know. Was he a great pitcher? Yeah, sure. Was he a great pitcher? This is what I got to know. Well, this is one of the premier pictures of all times. Yeah, I know what. Listen: what about the drug suspensions? He's clean now. You know this? Absolutely. Hmm. You know, he hasn't pitched in a year and a half. Joe, this is a guy that really wants to make it back. Bottom line, Joe T. The boss wants this guy. Are you going to use him or not? Don't worry about it, Doc. It's only spring training. [bat hits ball] All right. Still spring training. There's two weeks to go. You'll get him next time. It's only spring training. I've lost Mélido Pérez. He's gone for the season. Jimmy Key has had surgery. It takes a whole year to come back from that one. Kenny Rogers is banged all over the place. And Andy Pettitte is inexperienced, and that is four out of my five starting pitchers. What about Doc Gooden? Doc Gooden. He's a good pitcher, isn't he? 1986, he was a great pitcher. How they going? Great. Almost ready. Not the hamburgers, the team! Great. Almost ready. [Radio announcer] Sal from the Bronx-- you're on the air! What's on your mind? [Sal] Are you kidding? It's gonna be a long year! And I don't mean into October! It's simple! It's so simple! You know it, I know it, everybody knows it except Clueless Joe! The Yankees got no pitching. None, zip, zilch, nada. [Tony from Tenafly] Hey, I wish 'em luck, you know what I mean? [Sal from the Bronx] Yeah, right. What good's luck gonna do 'em? Wasn't exactly a great pre-season, Joe. Pre-season's for football. It's spring training, that's all it is. Not any more, Joe. So, are the Yankees ready for the season? Well, we're about to find out, aren't we? [crowd groans] [Radio announcer] You're on! [Caller] Twenty-one games, they lost ten. They can't pick up the ball, they don't know where to throw it, no pitching, no hitting-- they lucky they haven't lost all of them! [crowd booing] I left my purse out there on the field. Focus, man. They're pretty upset, Joe. Better talk to 'em. [bats clattering] How's your arm, Doc? It's fine, and you? Good. Real good. We'll get it back. Paulie? Yeah? You played some football in college, right? Yeah, some. How many games in a football season? Twelve. How many games in a baseball season? A hundred and sixty-two. Joe's right, boys. We got more games, let's get the focus back! Let's dig in! [smattering of applause] [chattering] Come on! Joe? Joe. Telephone. Yeah, would you tell him I'll call him back, Zim? Joe, it's George. [Steinbrenner] How ya doin', Joe? Uh, fine, George. Well, this is one of those I thought we could win, but sometimes they just get away from ya. No, no, no, I meant you, your family. You settled in, got a nice place? Lovely place. And there are no problems, because, uh, if there are... No, not at all, George. And no distractions, I mean, nothing is preying on your mind? Nothing. Well, that's all I want to know, Joe. [beeps] You know what's wrong. We haven't got any hitters! You're the trading genius. Why can't you get me any hitters? We've got hitters, Mr. Steinbrenner. That's not the problem. If you're looking for an area where you want to make personnel changes, you've got to consider the fact that in our last four losses, we gave up six, seven, eight, and ten runs! Unless we get some pitching help, we've got to find some hitters! If you're gonna give up that many runs, you got to score runs! A lot of them! Where's all these olives come from? Are these Greek olives, or Italian ones? [Woman] No, no, no, no. Italian. These are Italian olives. You sure? Has it got a lot of salt in there? Kalamata? All right, what's this all about? Beats the hell out of me. I didn't call this meeting. Joey, this is not a meeting. All right, so it's not a meeting. But what's it all about? Yeah, Rae. What is it all about? It's about your brother. Frank? What did he do? He didn't do anything. Why isn't he here? He's in Florida! Exactly... and why is he in Florida? Uh, because he lives there? [laughs] With his brother managing a baseball team practically across the street from where he has an apartment! He doesn't want to get in my hair! It's very thoughtful of him. A-Are we talking about the same brother here? Come on, please! Ah, this is crazy. Come on, hey, gimme a break! So pick up the phone, and ask him why he's there! Yeah! You guys, listen to your sister. [Rae] Thank you. Now, Frankie lives for baseball, right? Yeah. Every time there's a game, he calls you whether you are playing, whether you are managing, whether you are broadcasting-- whatever, right? Has he been calling you? No. How soon can you go? Soon as is humanly possible. [booing] Let's call it a night, Doc. Don't know what's the matter. The ball's straight. Stays up. It's a long road. We're gonna need you. He'll come around. [knocks] Joe? Doc! Come on in, have a seat, will you? Doc, it's only temporary until you get it worked out, but for now, I got to pull you out of the rotation. You'll work out of the bullpen for a while, low pressure situations, it'll come around. You know, I-- I have eighteen long months to think about how bad I screwed up my life, you know, I let my dad down, and when I got that suspension letter-- You know, I just kind of bottomed out, I really got down, and I was just kind of numb. Then I said to myself, "I can make it back." You are back. You're in the major leagues. You just gotta do a little more work. I threw all last year, Joe. I threw all winter, getting ready to come back, and my arm is fine, Joe. It's just um... It's just-- Just-- It's just not there. Don't give up. Don't give up on yourself. Hey, Joe. Come here. I want you to see something. This is Doc in '85, and this is him now. Now, I been looking at these over and over again, tryin' to see what's different. I can't find anything. Yeah. I don't know what the problem is, Joe. Well, maybe that's the problem. He is trying to do what he did when he was 21. Can you imagine if we tried to do the stuff that we did when we were 21? [grunts] Good night. Get some sleep, pal. Yeah. Hey, Doc? Like you to try something. I want to see if we can eliminate some of the parts of your motion. Like, simplify it. Bring your hands up slowly. No, no, no. Not that high. Down. Good, good. Now pull back a bit. All right. You okay there? Mm-hmm. All right. Try a couple. How'd that feel? Good. Good? [laughs] All right, here. There you go. Throw a couple more. Oh! Hey, Frankie. Hey, Rae! How are ya? [laughs] I got a little dizzy for a second. I'm fine. Oh! You all right? Yeah, hey. No problem. Hey! Come on, let's get a cup of coffee. How are you? I'm good. You look beautiful. You always look beautiful. Ahh! Well, you do. Come on! [cheering] [Announcer] It'll be a 2-2 to Tartabull. Struck him out swinging! Breaking ball away! Well, Coney's been great today. I think that's gonna do it for him. Ends with 12 strikeouts! He looked phenomenal today out there. Great game, Coney. I don't know where we would be without you. How long has this been this way? Not long, Joe. What does that feel like? It's okay. Doesn't hurt. Which is it? Doesn't hurt? Or okay? What do you mean? Can you feel what I'm doing? Yeah, you're moving my fingers. Honest answer, Coney. [sighs] After about the fourth inning or so, sometimes later, I guess, I can't feel my fingers at all. So this isn't the first time it's happened. Last couple of games. Goes away in about an hour. I shook his hand. It was ice. Ready, Joe. I must have done something right in a previous life. I have never seen two more beautiful women. Did you hear that? I guess he likes your dress. [chuckling] What were you thinking about? When? Just now. When I walked in. You looked so lost. Well, I was lost, and then you came in, and how could I be lost? [coos] Aw. That's such a beautiful thing to say. I read it somewhere. [chuckles] [laughing] [phone ringing] [yawns] Hello? Ali, it's Rae. Is Joe there? Can I talk to him? Um, well, he's still sleeping. He didn't get in till 2:00 a.m. I hate to wake him up. He's not been sleeping very well. It's kind of important, Ali. Okay. Joe? It's Rae. She says it's important. What? It's Rae. She's on the phone. Oh. Hello, Rae. What's the matter? Frank's sick. He won't go see a doctor, and I can't get him to do anything about it. Put him on. He does not know that I'm calling you. It's okay. Put him on. Oh. Frank? Hmm? It's Joe. He wants to talk to you. Ohh. This another one of your brainstorms? What brainstorms? This is your brother. Your brother who loves you? He wants to talk to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Joe, how you doing? Go to a doctor. Yeah. Hey, how about that game last night, huh? This Cone-- hell of a pitcher. Where the hell would you be without him? Well, we're about to find out. He's got a problem with his hand. Yeah? Is it serious? I don't know if it's serious, but I do know that he's got enough sense to go and see a doctor. What are you doing, Frank? What the hell are you doing? Hey, Joey, thanks. I really appreciate it. I'm busy right now. What the-- Bye. I love ya. [sighs] [players chattering] Fellas. Everybody, listen up. Joe's got something he needs to tell ya. All right. First things first. I want you to hear it from me before you hear it from anybody else. Coney needs surgery. Oh, come on. He's got an aneurysm in his pitching shoulder. We hear "aneurysm," we get scared, but it's not like that. It's not life-threatening. He's gonna have the surgery this week, and it's all gonna get taken care of, so we have nothing to worry about on that score. I think I only have to say this once, 'cause I know you all know it. This is a 25-man game. Will it be harder to win without Coney? Absolutely. Which means each and every one of you has to pull that much harder. So let's not waste time and energy lamenting on what we don't have. Let's concentrate on what we do have-- each other. Yeah. Right. You got it, Coach. You got it. All for one. That's right. All right, guys, let's go! All for one! Let's go play. Let's go have fun! Come on! [chattering] Come on, come on. Go back, back. Doc. What's up? Feel like starting tomorrow? Yeah. Where? Columbus? I need somebody to start tomorrow against Seattle. It's yours if you want it. Yeah. [chuckles] [sighs] [grunts] [grunts] Let's hope he can pitch like that with his clothes on. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! Shh! I don't know what to do, Joe. I mean, if this is gonna be his last hours, I think I should be there, right? Have you talked to him? I didn't know what to tell him. I just kind of wanted to make up my mind first. I mean, he always said that if... [stifled crying] He said he never wanted me to lose my turn. So... [paper rustling] [mutters] [phone buttons clicking] Dan Gooden. Dad, it's Dwight. How you doing? 'Cause you know I'll be on the next flight. Because I'd like to be there with you, that's why. Right. Right. Okay. Right. First thing in the morning. I love you. He says, uh, the operation is first thing in the morning. They're gonna give him something to sleep, and he'll be knocked out all night, and he don't want me sitting in some hospital room looking at him. Well, you knew what he would say. You know, when I messed up, the thing that hurt me most was the hurt I caused him. Uh, yeah. I knew he would say that. Then you're pitching for him. Is it time? Yeah. It's time. Oh. Uh, thanks. [crowd cheering, applauding] [TV announcer] One on, one out. Top of the first inning. Doc Gooden facing the great young star of the Mariners, Alex Rodriguez. The pitch. Swung on and driven to deep center field. Gerald Williams back. Going way back. He makes a great one-handed catch! Fires back toward the infield. They have a chance to double-brag. It's a double play! [TV announcer #2] That is about as good a play as you will ever see by an outfield. Oh, baby! The pitch to Griffey. Swung on and missed! Struck him out. Fastball. Here's the two-two to Buhner. Swung on and missed. He got him with a strikeout. The pitch. Strike three is called. Fastball inside to Bragg. I don't know what the hell you said to him, but he's really popping the ball. Oh, I haven't seen his fastball rise like that since '89. That-a-way, Doc! [cheering] Two outs, top of the 7th inning. Gooden staring into Girardi for the sign. He winds, kicks, and deals. Wilson, fly ball to center field. Going back is Gerald Williams. He's there and puts it away. And Gooden is just six outs away from history. Indeed. He's got a no-hitter through seven as he walks to the dugout, where, obviously, Mike, no one's gonna talk to him. Baseball tradition. You cannot jinx this man. And, you know, the eyes of the world are on him right now, but he might be the loneliest person on earth. [cheering continues] You ever caught a no-hitter? You ever manage one? I don't think I can stand to watch. Will you shut up? One inning to go for the no-hitter for Gooden. In the 9th with Rodriguez leading off, the three-one pitch from Doc. It's low outside. He walks him. How many pitches is that? 113. He's tired. Get Wetteland warmed up. So, Gooden alone with his thoughts. Trying to win the game. Trying to pitch a no-hitter. And the tying run at the plate, the dangerous Edgar Martínez. It'll be a 3-2 pitch. Rodriguez leads. And Gooden deals. Breaking ball, outside. [crowd groaning] He loses Martinez. And now the worry isn't only about the no-hitter, but about the game. Is Wetteland ready? Yeah. He's ready. Two on, one out in the 9th inning. Gooden trying to win the ball game, leading 2-nothing, and earn his place in baseball history. The pitch to Buhner is low. Gets away from Girardi. A wild pitch, and the runners move to second and third. And now a base hit not only breaks his heart but ties the game. Wanna talk to him? You go. [crowd cheering] [blows] [exhales forcefully] I'm just here to give you a breather. Uh-huh. Joe says the game's yours. So just try to relax as best you can, hmm? Mm. If this guy's gonna hurt you, make him hurt you on your pitch. All right? Mm. All right. [pats back] [cheering continues] It's great. One out to go. One out in the bottom of the 9th for Gooden to get. The left-hand hitting Paul Sorrento, and it'll be a one-two pitch, with tying runs at second and third. Now Gooden is set. The pitch. He pops it up! He's gonna do it! Yes! He's gonna do it! In short, left field! Jeter back on the grass. Back on the outfield grass, waiting, looking. Jeter makes the catch! Yeah! Dwight Gooden pitched a no-hitter! And the Yankees are mobbing Gooden on the mound! This team is going wild. Dwight Gooden with his first no-hitter of his long, illustrious career. Remember, this is a guy who suffered in the depths of drugs, and right now, here in the grass, he is sitting on top of the world. [crowd cheering] [no audible dialogue] [cheering fades out] Last night, Doc Gooden used baseball the way I've used baseball all my life. It shuts everything else out. There's the game, right there in front of you, and then there's everything else you don't have to think about, if you can only play the game hard enough. Hey, Zimmo? Yeah? Did you buy these cigars for me? Damn sure did. I feel bad. I've been telling everybody you're a cheap bastard. [laughter] What's on your mind, Duncan? We play today, we win today. Dassit. [caller on radio] That's what I've been telling you. They got the right guy. Slow start, and he didn't panic. Torre's a winner. [radio show host] You're next. [caller #2] I mean, Gooden's on fire. He's on fire! And what about Jeter, huh? And Martinez? Tony from Tenafly. [Tony] I don't know how the guy done it, but he got 'em half a game out! They take Cleveland in this doubleheader, they're in first place, man! First place! Look at this place. How come we don't have a place like this? They won a league championship, and we didn't. All right, guys. Hey, Mariano, you got any thoughts today? We play today, and we win today. Dassit. Twice. [players whooping] Let's go, man. Let's go, guys. Come on. You see the washrooms? They're fantastic. Really? Yeah. [Announcer] The Yankees need one out, one out-- and they'll go into first place in this first game of a doubleheader against the Indians. John Wetteland trying to get that out. And he has a one-two pitch coming to Kenny Lofton. Now Wetteland is set. He deals. Breaking ball hit on the ground towards second. Duncan backhands. He throws. In time! Ball game over. Yankees win. [cheering] The Yankees win! I told you they'd be in first place. Don't count your chickens. It's a doubleheader. Yeah! They haven't beaten Cleveland all year. There's always a first time. What would you like for dinner, honey? You wanna go out? You wanna cook something h-- Uh, honey? Rocco? That's what I wanna see you keep doing. No problem. No, it's a problem, because if you don't keep reminding yourself of that, you're gonna go back to trying to pull everything. Joe. Joe, Ali's on the phone. Listen, I think I'm gonna sit Paulie for the second game. Yeah. You need to think about Girardi too. He took some bad foul tips. Yeah. Hi, sweetie. What's up? Joe, are you sitting down? Frank? It's Rocco, Joe. He, uh-- He had a heart attack. Christ. What hospital is he in? No hospital, Joe. [phone clicks in cradle] Roc... we won the second game 9 to 3 behind Mendoza. It was a blowout. We're in first place. This is the lineup card. I wanted you to have it. And all the guys signed this. I'm gonna win it this time. Christ, I wanted you to be there. [knock on door] Come in. [door opens] You wanted me, boss? Where's Darryl Strawberry? We didn't sign him. You mean he's available? I mean, he's out of baseball. Nobody wanted him. Find him. What the hell am I gonna do with him? Who am I gonna sit down? DH, I guess. You could put him in the outfield. Hell, I don't know. I got no room for him, Zim. Well, he was a hell of a hitter. We could sure use some good offense now. Can he still hit? Do you know? I don't know. [chattering] Hey, Darryl. What's up, brother? [laughs] About time, cuz. It's good to be here, Doc. Hey, welcome to the zoo, man. Welcome to the dark side, man. You gonna do some banging for us, huh? Maybe later. Right now I gotta go see the man. See you later, man. See you later. [chattering] Hello, Darryl. Hey, chief. I just wanted to say that I'm here to do whatever you need me to do. I appreciate that. I don't know what you've heard about me, but-- I've heard it all. But I just wanted to say that-- Darryl, as far as I am concerned, history starts today. [shaking hands] Thanks, skipper. [TV announcer] The pitch. Strawberry launches one! [crowd cheering] It is high, it is far! It is gone! A long home run for Darryl Strawberry! [radio show host] You're on the air. What do you wanna talk about? [radio show caller] I'll tell you what it is. Joe Torre's got these guys playing together like a team. No stars, just a team. You're up. [caller #2] I'll tell you what the difference is. It's Joe Torre. They're playing for this guy the way he used to play. [cheering fading out] Rae, it's Joe. What's happening? I'm-- I'm worried sick, Joey. I thought he was going to the doctor. He's gone to everybody-- this doctor, that doctor-- and it's getting worse and worse. I think-- I think he just gave up, Joey. Rocco dying seemed to just take everything out of him. You just listen to me, Rae. We lost Rocco. We are not gonna lose Frankie. Do you hear me? What's she doing? Is she talking to Joey? Mm. What's she bothering him for? Rae, put him on. Tsk. [sighs] Hey, Joey. What the hell do you want from me? I'm getting old, that's all. There's nothing anybody can do about it. You are so stupid, you know that, Frankie? Hey, Joey, come on now. I'm your older brother, remember? A little respect. I show you respect. But I'm not gonna take it easy on you. Did you ever take it easy on me? When I was just out of high school and no team would take a look at me, did you take it easy on me? Joey. Let me talk! You made me take off the weight, you made me into a catcher, and it worked out good, didn't it? Yeah. What the hell does that got to do with it? It's got everything to do with it. You didn't let me quit, and I'm not gonna let you quit. No way. If the doctors down there can't help you, then you'll come up to New York. We have the best doctors in New York. But I got nothing in the tank. What the hell is the point? The point is, I have lost one brother this year, and I am not gonna lose another one. [sighs] [sirens wailing] [radio show host] Tony from Tenafly, you're up. [Tony] These guys are trying to drive me crazy. They sweep the Orioles, they got a 12-and-a-half game lead. It's all over, right? Wrong. They lost five games this week. Here come the Orioles. Unless these clowns get their act together-- Sal from the Bronx, you're on the air. What's on your mind? [Sal] Hey, come on. What's everybody panicking about? They're still in first place, ain't they? Mm. Hi. Hi. I was trying not to wake you up. I've been waiting for you. Yeah? Come. [sighs] Tired? Been a long time. I've been on the road too long. Mmm. Skip, it's just a strain. He should be able to throw again in ten days, maybe two weeks. If we had to pick one guy we couldn't afford to lose... Yeah. No kidding. Well, it's gonna screw up the bullpen for a couple of weeks, but I think we can handle it. They damn well better handle it. Okay. [chattering] [bat smacks ball] Oh, no, no, no, no, no! [exclaims] [crowd cheering] What? The Orioles just tied it up. Are we playing 'em? No. Then what do you care what they do? We were 12 games up. Now it's only seven. We are seven games up, they are seven games down, and we're the ones who are worrying? They must be about ready to kill themselves. [chuckling] Hey, how you doing? [Woman on P.A., indistinct] Oh, there's Rae. Where's Frankie? [no audible dialogue] Hey, Joey. How are ya? Good to see ya. Hey, Joey. [laughs] How are ya, kid? Hi. How you doing? How am I doing? Eh, I don't know, Joey. I don't know. It's all right. We're gonna get you fixed up, okay? Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Come here. Give him to me. Hey, lookit... We have him stabilized. I wish I could tell you more, but we don't know yet. I'll be running some tests tomorrow. I'll have some answers for you in a couple of days. Thank you. ♪♪ [rock] [chattering] Hey! All right! Hey, Doc. Looking good, man. [mutters] Hey, Coney, you here to save our asses, man? [laughter] Coney, Coney, Coney, Coney. I miss you so much. [laughter] All right! We got ourselves a Coney. He's back. He's back, and he's bad. He's badder than ever. ♪♪ [continues] What do you think of that? Don't push it, Coney. [grunts] It's coming back, Joe. I'll be back before the season's over. Five more minutes, then shut it down. What do you think? Kid's got guts. Is that a yes? I don't know, Joe. I don't know. [TV announcer] Left-hander Lloyd on the mound. Stares in for the sign. Working out of the stretch, he sets up the letters and delivers. [bat smacks ball] [crowd cheering] Driven deep to right center field. O'Neill giving chase. And he pulls up. [crowd groaning] That's a ball that O'Neill really should catch. [crowd jeering] [grunts] Am I out? You're hurting, Paulie. I'm gonna put Ruben in. Take the rest of the day off. Paulie... we got a long way to go. Your brother needs a new heart. A new heart? Actually, Joe, the surgery's the simplest part. The hard part is finding a donor. We have to wait. Well, how long does that take? There's no way to tell. If we're lucky, we could find one tomorrow, but it really could take months. What? Two, three, five? I'll be honest with you, Sister. I don't think your brother has that much time. You wanna talk about it? Nothing to talk about, really. Not talking about it won't make it go away, Joe. No. See, I was this little kid from Brooklyn. But it's like I grew up too late. My brothers and sisters were already grown up. And the house was a madhouse. My father was always hitting my mom. You know that. Scared the shit out of me. You know the story about how Frank threw him out? He had a lot of guts. He was everything I wanted to be. He was my hero. He was a major leaguer. He was in the World Series. You will be too. Yeah. But here's the thing, Ali. I get this shot out of nowhere... and just as I'm about to get there, my brothers... Rocco won't be there, and probably Frank won't be there. It's like I wake up out of one nightmare, and I'm in the middle of another one. Let's go to bed. Come on. Joe, Paulie's all upset about that piece Al Post did on his radio show last night. Said you benched him for not hustling after that ball in the 7th. Post is a son of a bitch. Yeah, but you're gonna have to talk to Paul. I'll talk to Paulie, and I'll do more than that. [laughing] Al, where'd you get the information for that piece you ran last night? Well, I, uh, covered a lot of stuff last night. Relief-pitching home runs are way down. I talked about that. Don't get cute with me. You know what I'm talking about. No. Tell me. I benched Paulie O'Neill. That's what you said. Yeah, I know. I was watching the game, Joe. You took him out, I didn't. Don't mess with me! I don't appreciate you trying to stir up something in this clubhouse. Well, he could've caught the ball on the fly. Instead, he one-hops it. Next inning, you sent Rivera out to play. Now, tell me, what part of that did I get wrong? Except for sending Rivera out, all of it. The next time you wanna talk about why I did something, you come to me and you ask me, and I'll tell you. Paulie O'Neill is playing on legs that would have you lying in bed, moaning for somebody to bring you soup. He's out there every day busting his ass! And if it weren't for him, we wouldn't be in first place. You understand? He's a team player. That's something you would know nothing about! I took him out 'cause I could see his legs were hurting, and I need him the rest of the way! Those are the facts! And if you were doing your job, you'd have got it right before you went on the air! That's it right there. Tell him, Coach. [chattering] So, what do you hear from Steinbrenner? He's gotta be on your case now that Baltimore's back in it. I hear nothing. That's worse. Why is it worse? He already decided to fire you. I know it. [chuckles] Frankie, the last time that Joe Torre was fired, he was finished. It was over, done. This thing is all a big gift to me. They give you an extra life, and you live it as long as you can. And then when it's over, it's over. What the hell are you talking about, managing the Yankees or a heart transplant? [chuckling] Joey. [radio show caller] The last thing this team needs is playing the Mariners in Seattle. Ever since the play-offs last year, those guys hate each other. They just hate each other. Come on, man. That was last year. They're out to get us every year. If they throw at another one of our hitters-- "Hitters"? Me. They throw at my head every time I go up there. Man, what you gonna do about that? [TV announcer] O'Neill gets knocked down. [crowd groaning] It happened again. Seattle has done this repeatedly to Paul O'Neill. And he gets up. He doesn't like it a bit. The umpire gets between O'Neill and the Seattle catcher. [crowd shouting] Now they go at it. O'Neill knocks him down. And the benches start to empty, Mike. We're gonna have a brawl. [Mike] We are gonna have a brawl. It's going to be nasty too. These two teams hate each other. They've hated each other for a long time. That's awful. Sometimes that's all a team needs to get fired up. Something better get them fired up. They've lost four in a row. Hey, do you have to remind me? That's not good for my heart condition. Oh. [thud] [chattering] What the hell is this, huh? They throw at us, and we do nothing to them! Relax, man. Wasn't his fault. Oh, no? Our pitchers have to protect us. Come on, man. There was nothing he could do. He got warned. Warned? They throw at Paul O'Neill twice, and you don't do nothing! [overlapping shouting] The enemy is out there! On the ball field! [door opens, closes] [chattering] Oh, she walked? [laughs] Yeah, well-- Oh, I see. Held onto the wall, but it's still walking, right? Yeah. Ali, I love you so much. These road trips are just tough. They're tough. I miss you. I miss you two. All right. Kiss her for me. I love you. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye. The pitch. Hit on the ground toward short. Jeter boots it. Fields, fires low and wide. Past Duncan to shallow right field. Two runs will score for the A's. And the Yankees are playing terrible baseball. Okay. Let's go, you bathing beauties. Joe wants to talk to you. [chattering] What's going on? All right. Run your ass, boys. It's not gonna be pretty. [scoffs] All right. We have a two-and-a-half game lead, and we are gonna win this thing. That's not a guess. That's not a promise. That is a fact. We are gonna win this thing. And I wanna tell you how proud I am of each and every damn one of you. Go and get some dinner. I don't wanna see any one of you here sooner sooner than an hour and a half before tomorrow's game. No batting practice. Damn straight we gonna win it. New York Yankees! Come on! Yeah! All the way to October! [chattering] Charlie Hayes? That's the best you can do? He's a solid third baseman. He's got a little pop in his bat. He's got ten home runs. Boggs is tired. His legs is bothering him. His back is bothering him. He's not driving the ball. We need help at third. The Orioles just signed Eddie Murray. Eddie Murray is a great ballplayer. He's got 3,000 hits, 1,500 RBI's, 500 home runs. And I'm just looking for a good, solid ballplayer who can play third base. You're the general manager. I don't need a statement, Bull, just a confirmation or a denial. If you wanna talk, let's talk about the trade. Charlie Hayes? We got that. That's yesterday's news. Klapisch is citing an anonymous source in the Bergen Record that says that George has decided to replace you. I am still here, aren't I? Isn't my statement enough? So you're denying it. You say you're not gonna be fired. I don't think about that. The club's still in first place. The lead's down to two and a half. It is still a lead, isn't it? That is still first place. What happens if you fall out of first place? If we blow a 12-game lead, then we deserve to be fired, Joe Torre and I. You don't blame the passengers when the plane crashes. We fly the plane. [overlapping questions] It's over there. [car horn honking] [Ali] Hey! Hey, guys, I'll catch up with you later, okay? Hi. Hi. How are you? What are you doing here? Well, I had to get out of the house. The phone is ringing off the hook. What phone? What are you talking about? You haven't seen the papers? No. Not only is George firing us, but we're gonna fire ourselves. [laughing continues] I'm not gonna talk about that. Do you wanna talk baseball? I'll talk baseball. Just one thing, Joe. Did you talk to Watson? Did he clear that statement with you? That's two things, and it's not baseball. I gotta check on some people. [overlapping chatter] Hey, Joe. Off the record, if you want. How's your brother? I've got an aunt in the same hospital. How's he doing? He's okay. He's in good spirits. He's got a bad heart. Clock is ticking. [chattering] [bat smacks ball] [players exclaiming] ♪♪ [rock] Talk to you a minute, Boggsy? Take it easy, man. Charlie Hayes is coming in this afternoon. He was playing out on the coast. I want you to know that you're my third baseman. Right. It's not a platoon thing. I'm gonna give him a little playing time because I know you're tired. We got a month to go, and then the play-offs. You okay with this? Oh, don't worry about me. It's not like that, Boggsy. We're just trying to give you a little rest. We're gonna need you in the stretch. [player] Wait up! Hey, Ray. Would you help me carry this bat out to the field? I'm a little too tired to take it myself. [chattering] [crowd clapping rhythmically] [chanting] Let's go, Yankees! [clapping] [mutters] Let's go, Yankees! [Man] Hey, Joe! [crowd] We're praying for Frankie! We all are, Joe. Thanks. I kept telling myself, "This time I got the horses. "This time I'm gonna do it. "All right. The lead is cut down, but that's okay. We're gonna hold on." But it really wasn't until this week when I began... [snoring] It's so up and down. Some days he seems so much better. I'm afraid there'll be fewer and fewer of those days, Joe. There's gotta be something we can do. We can't do anything until we locate a suitable heart. What are we gonna do, just watch him slip away? That can't be right. There's gotta be something we can do. We're looking for a healthy heart in a person who has just died. That doesn't happen every day. Well, how long can he wait? If we're lucky, if he's lucky, maybe a month. Any pain? None. David Cone checks in to get the sign. Now off the stretch, he deals. Struck him out! Looking great. He has great movement for a guy who's been out three months. Eighty pitches? Eighty, ninety. Somewhere in there. No more than that. He knows? He knows. Cone checking the sign. He'll deal to Terry Steinbach 2-2. The pitch. Struck him out swinging! Is this an incredible story or what? Can you believe this guy? Hasn't pitched in three months, and look at him. Yeah, I believe him. I've known him a long time. [Announcer] Two outs in the 6th. Cone deals Larado. Cut and a miss by Terry Steinbach. He struck him out again. [2nd announcer] Mike, do you believe this? How great Cone is pitching? I'll tell you what: this is bad fiction. Three months ago, you had to wonder if the guy was going to live-- he had an aneurysm, and now he's on the mound for the first time, and he's pitching a no-hitter! You really have to wonder, though, how long does Joe Torre let him go? Sixty. [Announcer] Two out, bottom of the seventh inning, Cone pitching a brilliant game, his first game back from aneurysm surgery. He stares in for the sign, sets, and deals to Berroa. Swung on and hit deep to center field. Bernie Williams on the run. Going back, on the track. At the wall, he leaps, and what a play by Bernie Williams! And he keeps the no-hitter alive! Am I done? You're at 85, Coney. You're done for today. You know it is possible I could have a quick 8th. Even if you do, you won't pitch the 9th. You know I never pitched a no-hitter before. You leave it up to me, I'm going back out there. It's your call. Get Mariano warmed up for the 8th. Coney, great game. Good one, Coney. Good job, Coney. Way to go, Coney. Coney! Good job, man. These guys are gonna win it all. I know it. [Announcer] A packed house at Yankee Stadium, and the Yankees need one more win to clinch the American League East championship, and Mike, it would be the first time in 15 years the Yankees would have won a pennant. [Mike] And these fans are starved for it. The Yankees always used to win, and now there's been a long stretch, a lot of dry land, between the last time and now. The pitch to Fernando Viña is popped up to center field! Bernie Williams is there. Bernie... makes the catch! And the New York Yankees have won the 1996 Eastern Division championship. And the team is around Jeff Nelson. [announcers fade] [cries, laughs] [wild cheering] All right. Yeah. Ali, it's like someone's playing a joke on me. I used to think, if I wanted it hard enough-- but that never worked. So I say, "Give me another chance. Just one more chance." And now that it's almost there, it's like they're saying, "How much do you want it, Joe? Take your brother away?" Oh, Joe, it's not like that. You know that! [cheers, whistles] ♪♪ [country] [chuckles] Hey, come on, guys. We're not here to talk about me. I'm just a guy with a bum ticker. If you want me to talk, you want to talk about my brother. I mean, we just won the first round of the playoffs! How 'bout that? That was great baseball. Tremendous baseball! [cheering] [radio announcer] Sal from the Bronx, you're on the air! What's on your mind? [Sal] Fielder, Jeter, Bernie, O'Neill-- No way the Orioles can beat these guys! [loud cheers] Do you know what I believe? Do you want to know what I believe in my heart? When that boy touched that ball, that was my brother Rocco reaching down to help Joey. [Rae] So, what can I tell ya? Joey made 'em into a real team. Not just a bunch of strangers playin' a game, but-but people. [cheering] [Announcer] Yankees lead 9-3, 2 out, bottom of the 9th, and Cal Ripken up. For the Yankees, it all comes down to one out. If they win, they go to the World Series for the first time in 19 years. For Joe Torre, he'll go to the World Series for the first time in his long, 36-year career as player and manager. What a moment for Joe: his brother Frank, the memory of his brother Rocco. One out to go, Wetteland deals-- Ripken hits a ground ball to short. Jeter fields, throws-- low and dug out by Martinez! In time! And the Yankees win! The Yankees win! The New York Yankees have won the American League championship, and they're on their way to the World Series. Doctor. How are you doing? Congratulations. You got to find him a heart! Yeah, Joey's been MVP, but, uh, he's never been on a world champion team, either as a player or as a manager, so he's waited a hell of a long time. Makes it all the sweeter, believe me. [chuckles] [New Yorker #1] The Yanks! The second-best thing in my life, next to marrying my wife. [New Yorker #2] It's the best! It's a dream come true! It's fantastic! The Yanks are back! They're back! Sweep! Four games! All over! Gone! [TV announcer] Here we are in game one of the World Series, and the Yankees are getting clobbered. The Bomber bats are asleep tonight, and Atlanta is on fire! [Yankee crowd booing] [ball hits pole] [Steinbrenner] We're up against Maddux tomorrow. Do these guys know what this is? Thirty million people, and we get our butts kicked, 12-0. Ten. That's not just losing. People lose. This is being humiliated. Hello, George. [sighs] They tell me that's the worst clubbing in World Series history. Yeah, it was pretty ugly. [deep sigh] Tomorrow's a must game, Joe. Tomorrow we will probably lose. But then, we'll go to Atlanta and sweep three, and clinch it here on Saturday. Judas Priest. [TV announcer] Well, the Yankees come down to Atlanta trailing the World Champion Braves two games to none, about to face the best pitching staff in baseball in their own back yard. [Stadium announcer] ...the American League Champion New York Yankees... number six, Joe Torre! [cheering] [TV announcer] Swung on by Leyritz, and driven to deep left field. Jones back to the track, he's at the wall, he leaps, and it's gone! Bernie heading home, he slides, he scores! Right center field, Grissom... drops the ball! He dropped the ball! Drilled to deep right field. It is high! It is far! It is gone! Another... [fading] Like you said, Joe. We're taking the series home. [laughing] You taste it, Joe? I can taste it. We play day after tomorrow, we win day after tomorrow. Dass it! Hey, what are you? A wizard or something? That's exactly what you said! Sorry, I didn't see you on-- No, I was just trying to reach my brother. There's no answer in his room. Maybe his phone's just turned off. Try the switchboard. I'm afraid to. [Ali] Great win, Joe. Congratulations! You did it! I just knew... [beeps] [Frank] You did it, Joey. You did it. Congratulations, kid. Joey, I'm gonna do it too. They found a heart. [sensors beeping] [motor chugging] Hey. Joey, Joey. Joey! I need... six tickets for tonight's game. Um, I would, but I didn't think you were gonna make it, so I sold 'em. [laughs, winces] [laughing] [TV announcer] There is no greater setting for a World Series than Yankee Stadium. The Yankees have won 22 World Championships and they are poised for number 23 in front of a jam-packed Yankee Stadium crowd. This is really the Home Office for baseball. [crowd going wild] It's all set up right here, the Yankees are one out away. [2nd TV announcer] One out away, but Wetteland has a tough out, with the tying and go-ahead runs on base. Facing Mark Lemke. It'll be a 2-2 pitch to Lemke, as Wetteland deals-- popped him up! Off-third foul! Does Hayes have a play? Hayes toward the dugout-- Hayes reaching in... and he can't make the catch! As Hayes falls down in the Braves' dugout. [crowd groans] The Yankees were three inches away from winning the World Series! Now Lemke gets another crack at it. Well, that's baseball etiquette. Nobody was helping Charlie Hayes in that Braves' dugout, and now they have to do it all over again. That guy can give you a heart attack. Hector, would you shut the hell up! I'm sorry. [TV announcer] What drama. They were so close, a couple of inches away, and they would have won the World Series, and now Wetteland has to throw at least one more pitch. [player] Come on, Johnny! Ten years ago, I was one out away from winning the World Series, Dunc. I can't take it, I can't take it! Give it to him! Come on! What do you think? He's gonna get him out with this next pitch. And Wetteland deals to Lemke-- swing, and he popped him up! Get it, son, get it! The ball's in foul territory. Will this one stay in play? Hayes, waiting. Charlie Hayes waiting for the ball to come down. [cheering] Yeaahhhh!
