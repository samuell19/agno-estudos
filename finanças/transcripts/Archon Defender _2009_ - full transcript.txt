Where do you draw your line in the sand? My fondest memories are of my mother and father. Those were happier times. Before the uprising, before the chaos and terror, before the tyranny. Before Lucia. I was too young to know it at the time, but my father knew, and he's the only reason I'm still alive today. I still remember what he said to me, that we all have to draw our line in the sand. What? No, they will find us. Resonance signal, right tunnel. I can't make it. You go on ahead. Go on, get out of here. Geiss, no. Come on. Halt! No! Okay, fire it up. Let's see if it holds the link. Okay, that's got it. That's the last of it. We should be ready. Huh? Beth? They came without warning. You have to tell everyone. We have to escape to Archon. Hello? Hello, Arien? It's Martin. Oh, Martin. How are you? Sorry, there's no time. Is Marcus there? Oh, yes. He's right here. Marcus, what we talked about the other day, it's all true. What's that? Geiss is dead. Beth is here. There's no time. If you want to come with us, you have to come now. What is it? Geiss. Geiss is dead. We'll be right over. Colette, wake up. We have to go. There's no time. They moved sooner than we thought. Soldiers! We have to go out the back. Attention! Attention! Attention! This sector is now under containment protocol. Civil disobedience will not be tolerated. Stay in your homes. We have to get to Martin's garage. He has an unregistered lifter there. The child. Leave them alone. This child has done nothing to you. Go! Quickly! Antoine! Oh! Morning, Colette. You're doing the right thing. Let's get going. Father! Stay there. We have to go. Soldiers are coming. Ceasefire! Get down! The shard is the eternal remnant of creation. It links all life, but lies just beyond our conscious grasp. Nobody knows when their connection will awaken. My father suspected I had the connection and knew that I was not safe under Lucia's regime. Only through the help of his friends was I able to escape to Archon. Only then it was too late to save my mother and father. Sensei, I have failed. I have underestimated Lucia. Counsel, it is not too late. If we pull the troops back, and form a ring around the dome, maybe we can hold out until reinforcements... We could have reasoned with them when we had the chance. But now, this... That's the kind of weakness that got us into this position in the first place. You! Iasius, it's been ages. I hope you don't mind me redecorating a little? After all, I haven't forgotten the "favour" you did for me. Lucia, you've gone too far. Don't betray me again. I hate to think what I would do if all you put up half as much of a fight. Please, have mercy. Pathetic. The capital is ours, Empress, but there is fierce fighting in the outlying regions. They are more prepared for us than the nation of Cypria was. It seems our reputation begins to precede us now, General. What of the nation of Archon? We are close enough to strike. I can have Sky Marshal Orbis prepare... General, I do not intend to move against Archon until we cleanse Octavia of all Shard- sensitive. I will not have another uprising on my hands. Prepare the lifter for departure. Yes, Empress. Blink, Lucia. Abby? I wasn't... Hmm, he is a fine specimen. Don't be silly. Lucia, I know you better than that. Okay, but you can't tell anyone, especially Sensei. Lucia's in love. Not so loud! Oh, please, Lucia. It's practically painted all over you. Storm's coming up, Maurice. We better call it a day. Go on ahead. I'll catch right up with you. We shouldn't meet like this. I'll hear nothing of it. Besides, I made sure I wasn't followed. Oh, I didn't know Sensei taught being sneaky. He doesn't. It just comes naturally. Come on, I'll show you. Ah, Avi. Approach. Guards, leave us. Avi, you have shown excellent promise as adept and as a candidate for ascension. Shall I assume you have undergone the Initiates? Thank you, Counsel. Yes, Counsel. Ah, then what is the primary tenet in the mastery of Shard? Action flows through intent. Reaction is an emotional cascade. Then perhaps you might know why emotional control is so crucial. Counsel, to link without control of intent would lead to the... Black Shard. The Ascension ceremony is approaching. I would hate for it to be a showcase of Echelon's weakness. No, Counsel. It has come to my attention that a candidate has come under undue influence recently. I'm not accusing you, Avi, but if you know anything, keep in mind we will have guests from many city-states with us. Now, is there anything you might want to tell me, Avi? Yes, Counsel. This Maurice problem could be just the tipping point we need. I have had him sent to the construction project. Interesting. Then I may have a solution that will escalate our plans. Good morning, Adept. Bless. Is Maurice here today? Adept, he got the transfer order late last night. I'm afraid it was immediate priority. Oh? Do you know where they sent him? I'm afraid I don't know anything more. Avi, Maurice is gone. They sent him away. I have to find him. I have to! Lucia, calm down. It is close to the Ascension. You should be concentrating on your meditations. You sound just like them! I thought I could count on you, Avi. Lucia, I'm... I'm sorry. I overheard Counsel Leo in the garden. I know where Maurice is. Well, Maurice, you picked a hell of a day to start here. Oh? Why's that? They're going to lift the head of Seffodek today. You'll never see the levitation up so close. Meh, I've seen better. Don't move! Let me get this off of you! The Silent Aum. I can't link. Lucia, get out of here. No. I won't lose you. Lucia. Maurice! No! Maurice. Father? Is that you? I came back to see you one last time. Where is this? Shh. Do not worry. I must go soon. What? Where are we going? No. Stay here. There is something you must do. You have to go back for them. But... My friends will take care of you. I must go now. I will be waiting for you. What? Be at ease. I mean you no harm. What? Who... who are you? I am Octavien. Fear not. You will come to no harm here. What... what is this place? Ah, the plants here have forgotten the seasons it would seem. Is there something you have forgotten as well? I was on a lifter. Soldiers were coming. We were about to crash and... Mother. Father. My hand was.... Yes. Open your eyes. You have many things to see. Colette, are you all right? Yes. I had the dream again, the dream of the eyes. Colette, you're safe here with us in Archon. I feel like... like I should have done more. Somehow I could have saved them. You... you saved us all. If you hadn't awakened when you did, none of us would have escaped from Echelon. Now I need your help again. Come with me to the Archon Council tomorrow. I need you to help me convince them. We need to stand against Lucia. This... this power I feel growing inside me, they used to teach us about the Shard in class before Lucia. I've known you and the other monks my whole life but I never knew what it... what it was like until I awoke this, this power. Colette, I am no sensei. It took me five years to reach your level of awareness and you have outgrown my ability to teach in a quarter of that time. Only a master can teach you now. I... I will come with you tomorrow. Good morning, Colette. Ready to go? Hm, I will be once I get this coffee into me. I've never been much of a morning person. No rush. The diose transport won't be here for a while yet. Diose transport? We're not taking the lifter? No. Archon Council has grounded all Echelon lifters, civs, transports, even refugees. Can't say I blame them though. That's why we must convince the council for the sake of the people here, for the sake of those we've lost. I won't be going with you. Keep Antoine out of trouble. You've never seen Archon Doma before, have you? No. Don't let them intimidate you. I... I will not fail them again. Council will attend to you. The refugees are just the tip of the iceberg. The real problem is Lucia. Every time Lucia mobilizes, we get a flood of refugees, Shard sensitive monks, their families. Then it stops. Nothing. No one every escapes once Echelon consolidates power. Lucia is methodically and systematically persecuting Shard Sensitives. I am not convinced. I would feel it were it true. Council, the representatives of the Echelon refugees. Thank you... Thank you... ...Council. ...Council Excuse me, Archon Rem, but I couldn't help hearing you when we entered. Archon Ioss speaks the truth. I have seen it. We have seen it first hand. Lucia has mastered the Black Shard and broken the Silent Aum. This is why her intentions are hidden to you. She took us all by surprise. Very few of us from Dojo Ashedow managed to elude her grasp. And you, young Colette, you have seen all this as well? Archon, my mother and father are gone because of Lucia. They died saving me from Echelon. I was too young to know it at the time but my father knew. The uprising was a lie. The epidemic was a lie. The medical screening was a lie, an excuse to identify the Shard Sensitive. Then the disappearances started. Antoine taught me the Silent Aum even before I awoke to the Shard. It was my father's idea and he's the only reason I'm still alive today. I still remember what he said to me, that we all have to draw our line in the sand. Archon, where do you draw your line in the sand? This spot is my favourite part of the grounds. My sensei planted that tree himself when he was about your age. Our lives are like this tree reaching upwards, always branching. The choices we make are like the branches. Some bear fruit, some thorns, some fall to the ground having borne neither. What choice will you make? The Archon Defence forces will only accept a fully trained adept. Antoine tells me you are a fast learner. Yes, sensei. Thank you, sensei. We always have room at Dojo Cephadek. Alan. Are you okay? I'll be... Just go. She must be some catch. Hey, I thought I told you to stay out of my head. I am. Relax. You've been staring at that photo the whole trip. I don't always have to link to you to know what you're thinking. Believe me, I've been there. I couldn't be happier for the two of you. Well, look what the cat dragged in. About time you doggers showed up. Nyah, flyboy here is in love. Hah! I knew it. Let's get him up on the board. You guys have, seriously, too much time on your hands. What's for lunch? Well, let's see if anyone left anything good in the fridge. You guys better not be stealing my lunch again. We interrupt this program for an important news bulletin. This is the scene unfolding from the Atavia capital of Magino as the invasion by Echelon forces continues. We have reports that Atavia Dolmen has fallen and the collapse of the regency is imminent. In response to escalating hostilities, the Archon Council stood in emergency session today. We must establish a strong and unified response and a readiness to stand against Echelon's repeated over these last several years. We ask all Shard monks and pilots of able body to enlist with the Archon Defence Wing immediately to... Alan, what's wrong? You're so quiet. Mary, I have to go. I have to enlist. Your mother was an Adept. If what they say about Echelon is true, I can't let that happen to you. I... I will be with you. Company halt. Well... well you people are the sloppiest excuse for a platoon I've ever seen. You people couldn't even organize a garage sale at a garbage dump! Why, you maggots are worthless. Why, if it wasn't for... Private Belmont, front and centre! Drop to the deck, give me 20. Private Mark, you too. Drop down and give me 20. Pilot and resonator must act as a cohesive unit. If one is weak, then both are weak. It is by unity that we will prevail! I'll be right back. Mary. What are you doing here? I enlisted, Signal Corp. I told you I'd be with you. Mary, a warzone is a dangerous place. That's so typical of you. Don't worry, you'll be safe on my watch. So who's your resonator? Alan's fiancé Mary was jealous of me from the beginning. A pilot and resonator develop an intimate connection through the Shard, acting with singular intent, a unity of mind. Link deep enough, link long enough, and a lasting bond can form. This kind of thing was frowned upon in Echelon and forbidden under Lucia. Alan kept himself distant from me at first. But eventually he let down his guard. But Archon Defender never let down its guard. As the war drew on, the men of Wing 665 passed one by one. Eventually the war would touch all of us... more than I could have ever known. Brace yourself. We're going in hard. Copy that. Sir, the First Wave is coming in range of the forward zone plate batteries. Recall all units to minimum standoff distance. Yes, sir. Unit 23, withdraw to standoff point. Negative. I can take this one out. 23, fall back immediately. Acknowledge. Acknowledged. But I softened them up a bit for you. Sir, target's in range. Fire at will. Close the blast shields. We don't want to get caught in the collection burst. First Wave losses at 85%, Empress. Shall I order the withdrawal? No, Marshall. Continue to target. All units are to maintain heading. I will not tolerate deviation. To play so strong a hand tells me they are getting desperate and that we are gaining the advantage. Prepare the Dias quadrants for a ground assault. We will infiltrate under their defences and take the city of Halaphai as a staging ground for our final push. It seems that Archon might actually be a worthy adversary, Marshall. Sorry, sir, only emergency responders are allowed past this point. What have we done? You have gotten exactly what you wanted. Lucia broke through the Silent Aum. Few have such strength after years of mastery. You know she was the only one of The Adept who could resist our efforts. She will not be a challenge to us now in her state even if The Council does proceed with the Ascension. None can match you now. The Ascension. The Ascension will proceed. Ah, the gardens of Echelon. We do not have such splendour in Atavia. Sensei. Council tells me you have quite a strong connection. Thank you, Sensei. Let me show you something that not many people know. Lucia, you haven't been out of this room in days. Leave me alone, Avi! But the Ascension is today. I don't care, Avi! I don't care anymore. I finally found everything that I wanted and they destroyed it! Lucia, I'm sorry. If I thought Council Leo would send Maurice away, I would have never told him. Told him? Avi, you had a hand in this? After all this? This? Don't betray me again, Avi. If it's an uprising they want, it's an uprising they will get. The ceremony is closed, Adept. Lucia. What is the meaning of this? Get back. Link to me. Now! Ah, Vincent, you can join me or them. I will only ask you once. Alan, are you here? Martin, was Alan here yet? Sorry, I haven't seen him yet. Hmm. Where is he? Alan, Com has called a general deployment. It was my fault. I had that bomber in my sight. I could have taken it out then Mary would still be... Alan, I'm... Leave me alone! She was always jealous of you, of all the time we spent together linked. She could never link. Even though her mother was an Adept she could never. Alan, I'm not... No! Our last words alone were about you, how she resented you and this war and Echelon for driving us apart and because you are from Echelon. I never wanted any of this. Leave me alone. Damn it, Alan. Do you think you're the only one who's been hurt? Colette, I... I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, I'm sorry. I will not link to you so deeply again. I need these memories for myself. It's all that keeps me going. I will carry my past with me alone. All I ask is that you stand with me against Lucia. No, they're dead. Oh. Good thing, or we'd be in a fix. Colette, what are you doing? Thank you, Colette for freeing me. I have not known the touch of another until now. There are more like me, many more. Your brother is one of us. You can help him. You can release us from Lucia. Octavian, I don't understand. I have no brother. Colette, you do indeed. Your mother did not die when you were separated in Echelon. She was with child, though did not know it. This did not escape the notice of Echelon, however. Lucia's plan to harness the power of the Shard by taking the newly grown Shard Sensitive and bending them to her will before they were even aware of their own existence, their own will. It is the ultimate betrayal of innocence... but it will also be your downfall There is growing awakening amongst the resident and with all Shard Sensitive. You are part of this as well. Even though Lucia can feel this awakening she is blinded by her rage and her ambition. This is your advantage. You have the knowledge to defeat her. You have the will and intent. All you need now is to take action. Colette. Colette. Colette! Colette! Colette! Alan, are you okay? I think so. Are you okay to fly? The Tracer is wrecked. Can you fly a Dias transport? An Echelon Dias? We'll get shot down before we make it halfway to base. We're not going back to base. Lucia's command wing. We can stop this. She has grown bold and left herself exposed. Well, it's a bit roughed up but it'll fly. The Resonator is gone. How will you maintain the link? I will link directly. There is a growing intent among the Shard Sensitive, a growing aum against Lucia. I'm part of it. It's part of me. My aum is a focus of my will. Now, fly. Concentrate bombers on this front. Empress, there are no targets of military value there nor is there hardly any Resonant signal. Would it not be better to smash their defences and take the dolmen? They're hiding their strongest Adept there. They are sheltering the traitors there and they are shielding themselves from us. In maintaining the Silent Aum, they have no strength to mount a defence against a concentrated attack. Send out your bombers, Marshall. Vincent, ready the Dias squadrons. I grow tired of this protracted war. This will be a decisive victory. Yes, Empress. Fly towards the central cube. No. That's one of ours. Incoming! Is this the best Archon can send against me? I'll wipe you all out of my way. You fight like my old sensei. If I didn't know any better I'd think you had studied under him. Lucia, your tyranny has gone too far. He would have said something like that. Send him my regards. There is a growing awareness amongst the Resonant, a growing resistance to her will. Lucia is blinded by her ambition and rage. Otherwise she would feel this. This is your advantage. If you awaken enough of the Resonant, you can weaken her powerbase. Your brother is in one of her Resonators. How will I know which one? He will know you through your link to the Shard. When the time comes let yourself go and trust in him. Stay on course, stay on mission. I see you have quite a strong connection to the Shard. Shall I assume you have undergone the initiation? Action flows from intent. Reaction is emotional cascade. Her failure will be your failure. She has betrayed you through her failure. She has betrayed you as I have been betrayed. What? What is this? Lucia, it is you who has betrayed me. Who are you? I'm am Octavien. I am Achondel, Desmeril, Seffodek Fetra. You know me though you have forgotten long ago. I was waiting for you. No, I waiting for the Lucia that I used to know. You I do not know. I don't even know myself. Myself. This empire of yours, Lucia, this war, I did not want this, not for my sake. I just... I... Come with me, Lucia. I can end all this. Maurice, I... I'm... Father! We will be waiting for you, my daughter. It's over. Hold your fire. I remember walking by the ocean as a child standing in the surf as the waves broke around me washing away my footsteps with each passing moment until there remained no sign of my passage but for the memory. It seemed so vivid at the time, the war with Lucia and the end, like waking from a dream, a dream that fades as moments pass. When memory is gone, will it be that we never existed or is our time here now the memory, the dream of some other time and place?
