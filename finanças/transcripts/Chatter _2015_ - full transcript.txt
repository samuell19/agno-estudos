Hey Carl. Thanks for seeing me on short notice. - Of course, Nate. - Who's she? - Meghan Collins, we actually crossed paths at Arlington. - Meghan is Level 6, TAA, so I thought it best she be here. - Okay. - So what can we do for you? - It's about Carolyn. She disappeared during an investigation. I need your help. - Yeah I heard, but I'm not really sure what we can do. - Just take a look at this. - I mean seriously Dad, aren't you a little scared? That place looks like it's something out of a Stephen King novel. - Ah, you know me sweetheart, I live for this. Besides, there's not much going on here anyway. I've been here 4 nights and I am not impressed. - Oh, I'm so sorry the big bad ghost is being uncooperative. - Yeah well. - What? - I don't know, you remind me of your mom. - Dad. - She loves you very much Kay. - Yeah well, whatever, I wouldn't know. - Hey listen, I need to fill you in on some things when I get home about your mom. Shit! - What was that? - I don't know, came from upstairs, I think. - You okay? - Wow! That was impressive. I'm going to check it out. - Okay, be careful. - Yeah. Hey, record this. - Already am. Daddy?! Shit. Dad! - Carolyn, Carolyn! Carolyn, are you there? - Wow. - I need you to help me find her. - How? - You're Homeland Security, you're watching people. - Colonel Terry. - Mister Terry, I don't work for your people anymore. - Mr. Terry, I don't know what you think you have heard, but we are not in the business of spying. - Cut the crap, Meghan. I know all about this place. I know about Endesign Solutions, okay? - Endesign Solutions is a... - A DHS front. You're watching people, Carl. Internet, video chat, blah blah blah. - In the interest of Homeland Security, that is our purpose. - 2300 people go missing here every day without a trace. If you're monitoring people, there's got to be occurrences like this. She'll show up. - You're asking us to turn this division into Ghost Hunters. - We can keep an eye out, off the record. - What record? - If anything shows up, I'll let you know. You got it? - Yes, Mr. Director. - Thank you. She's out there, please find her. - This is the one I owe you, Nate. Keep it between us. - Oh, one other thing, once they know you can see them, they'll come after you. And so they're watching us, and they're listening to our conversations. And they always have been. The only difference is, now it's perfectly legal, thanks to the Patriot Act. So now some low-life, moron loser can sit around at the CIA, or the NSA, or Homeland Security, or any government agency, in fact, any independent contractor now since we job everything out. He can sit around and pleasure himself all day long listening to our conversations. How is that for American? - And Chris said that I told him that he was an asshole, but I told him that he was acting like an asshole. - What an asshole! - Oh god. - Oh, you gotta do what I do bro. You just fuckin' take your BCAA, you gotta take definitely your multivitamins, take lots of shits, and you'll be set, man! - Yeah Todd. Here we go. I totally think I could get used to this perspective, this is great. Just, if you wouldn't bending down, just, give me a little bit lower. - David! - Just lower little. - Stop it, I'm at work! - Nobody's around! C'mon, just a little peak. - No, you're bad! No. - I'm horny., I'm horny. Stop it, I'm at work. - Please? - No! - Oh hey! Uh, this is Alex. Hi Alex. - Hi! - Alex is the realtor who reps this house. - Oh, hi! - Sorry to interrupt, were you in the middle of something? - No! - Oh no! Haha, no. This is just us, we play this game, we uh, yeah. Do I need to sign something? - No, I'm just here to bring you the keys and I'll let you two get back to conversing. - Okay. - Oh, congratulations on your new home! - Thank you! - Okay - Sorry, don't mind my pervy husband! Bye! - Woo hoo! - Woo hoo! She's pretty. - What? - She's pretty. I'm not sure how I feel about you all alone with her running around. - Oh, come on! You know I can't wait for you to get here. - Yes, I know. - But actually, if you just gave me a little bit of skin, just to tide me over. - Just a teeny bit. - No! But I'll tell you what I will do, how about we set up a little play date later tonight? - Really? - Seven your time. - Awesome! I am counting the minutes, that sounds good. - Good. - I love you and I miss you. Bye. - Bye. - You working late? - Oh yeah, I'm swamped with these reports. - Just create a template, copy and paste. - Well, that's cheating. I could report you for that you know. Oh, an idealist! What are you doing working in Homeland Security? Uh, the pay. - Can you hit the lights before you go? Goodnight. - Night. - Sexy wife, it's about to be sexy time. This is kind of cool we're doing this. - Can you show me the house first? Please? - But sweetheart, it's sexy time! - If you do, I'll make it worth your while. - Okay, and we're walking! Obviously, this is the bedroom where the, um, magic almost happened. This is the stairs. This is what we walk up and down. Nice wood floors, I thought you would like that. - I do. Um, this is the living room, where, um, all the living happens. This is the dining room, where I guess I should probably fold some clothes or pick up stuff. This is the kitchen where we will eventually cook. - I love it. - Wash hands, drink cold beverages, and eat. Speaking of eating. This, you're gonna like this, is all the food I have. This is where you're supposed to feel sorry for me because I have no food and I'm gonna go hungry, so you need to get to town very fast 'cause you know what I'm like when I'm hungry. Back to the stairs. Walk back up stairs, tour is done. Back to the important room. Oh my gosh, what's this bed doing here? So weird! Gotta get up on it. All right, are we good now, did you see everything? Can we got on with the getting off? - Yes, you can have your present now. - Okay hold on! - Are you ready? - I'm ready! - Okay - Oh, I'm ready. - Oh my. You like? - Uh huh. - Yeah, yeah. God you're beautiful. I want you to pretend that I'm with you right now. Okay. Oh my God! Right! - Oh my God! - We have to do that again. - Definitely! - I mean, like before you leave and get here, we need to do that. - Again. That was awesome! You liked it? Yeah! - I can be, I can be ready in like, give me four minutes. Four minutes? What the? - Hold on. - What was that? - That was weird. - Is that chili? - Yes. - Is it seven in the morning? - Yes. - Would you like to have a berry? - No. - You know that you're going to kill yourself if you keep eating that way? - No, no, no. This is what's keeping me alive during this two week brain session for the film score, trust me. - You know it's going to be amazing no matter what you eat. - Oh hey, you know I put the bed together last night, right? - Mm-hm, yes, I saw. You're quite handy, I didn't know that. How does it sleep? - Pretty good. Except there must be a neighbor with a sick kid here or something. Or a cat that's literally dying. - Ew. - I kept hearing all this crying and moaning all night. It went on all night. - Do you know which neighbor it is? - No, I mean, we don't have anybody next door, so it must be, I don't know, somebody. I have to look around. Oh hey, I wanna show you something else. - Okay. - This is cool. I'm gonna switch to phone mode, okay? - Mm-hm. - Okay, can you see me? Yes, okay, we're good. So, quick tour. You've seen the living room and you've seen the dining room, and you've seen all the boxes I am diligently cleaning up. And uh, kitchen. But this, is what I wanted to show you. Check this out. Okay, bare with me. Oh, look! Huh, I found this yesterday. - Whoa, creepy! - Okay, hey look. How about that for fucked up? Jesus! David, who's that? - What, what? - I thought, I thought I saw someone standing upstairs. Nice try. Okay, look. Well hello there little girl. What the! - David! David what happened?! David are you okay? Okay, what the fuck? Hang on, just hang on for a minute, hang on. - What's going on? Where's the door? - Are you okay down there? I am. That scared the shit out of me! - Hi! - So um, yeah, we got a big creepy basement. - Are you okay? - Yeah, besides the pee running down my leg, I'm fine. Seriously, that scared me. You know what I could use? - What? - A little comforting. - Yes. - A little sexy time. Will you give me a little sexy time? You are insatiable! Why don't you do a show for me? - I need it! Sweetheart, look at this. - I can see, oh you're shaking! Do a show for me! - Do a show for you? - Yes! - Are you serious? - Yes. - Okay. How's that? - Hold on, how's this? Whoo! - We're gonna start with this number. - Oh my God! - I'm trying to get my hips in. Ugh. - That's what I call a coffee break. - Yeah. - Hi David. - Hi Jenna. - Uh, Charles needs us. See ya! - Sorry babe, I got to go. Bye. Hi! Ready, open! - I couldn't sleep. That freaking kid was up all night long. - Did you ever find out who has the kids? - No, I haven't. But when I do. Hold on. Uh, hello? Hey David, it's Alex, I'm returning your call. - Hi Alex, I'm on video chat with Laura right now. - Oh hi Laura! - Hi! - Um Alex, I have a really quick question for you. Sure. - Is there, does somebody in this building have a kid? Is there a kid in this building because I keep hearing, I keep hearing laughing and just. Hm, that's weird. - It happens at night-time. What? I don't know anything about any kids in the building. - Not at all, really? Cause, I mean it's very loud and there's. Maybe it's a neighbor's TV, you think? The other apartment's vacant, so it's no one in my building. - Okay, um that's weird. Yeah, I can't help you, I'm sorry. - Okay. - Mm-hm. - Thank you Alex. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. - Well that's odd. Did she sound a little defensive to you? - No, I didn't notice anything, I mean, maybe it's just her tone. So baby, I gotta go. Um, I have that video conference with the film producers, so I gotta get ready. - Yeah, you better get dressed! - Hey, I look good right now. These pajamas are rockin'. - Hey, I like those pajamas, but I don't know that they will. I love you. - I love you and I miss you. I love you. - Have a good meeting. - Okay, bye. - Bye. That last transition at 22:10, that needs to be a little more upbeat. Like your Crab Shack piece, but not as ska, you know? - Totally, got it. - And we need that by tomorrow afternoon so that we can lock picture, okay? Do-able? - Oh, absolutely. I'll get started on these changes right away. And um, I just wanted to say, that I appreciate you guys having me back. I feel awful about what happened before, so thank you. - I gotta take this. - Yeah, David, it's no problem. You're doing great. - Thanks, I don't want to screw up, you know? Laura and I, we really need this. - Yeah, I know! That's what brother in-laws are for. - Wow, see, cause I thought they were for giving really shitty Christmas gifts. - Well, you got that covered. - Seriously, thank you. - Yeah I know. Listen, I know it was hard losing the baby. - Yeah Laura handled the miscarriage a lot better than I did, so you know. - You got a good lady there. - Yeah, thank you. - Did I miss anything? - Nah man, we're just finishing up. - Okay, so um, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. Thanks. Talk to you tomorrow. - Okay, thank you. - Hi Charles. - Hey Laura. Just checking in on the financials for the Stevenson Estate. - They're all done, I'll have them to you tonight. - Great, thank you. You know, everyone around the office is going to miss you. I'm gonna miss you. - Thank you, Charles. - I know it's been tough working side by side with me since, you know, what happened with us. I'm really glad you stuck it out. - Okay. - Laura, I think that you should leave David. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Charles, I'm not having this conversation with you. - Why? I care about you, you clearly care about me. Don't act like what happened between us was a mistake. - I made a mistake. Okay, I stayed at the firm because I had to. - David is not the one. - I have a dinner meeting Charles, I have to go. - No wait, don't hang up! Fuck. Tom, I'm still working back here. Hey man! Okay, real funny Tom. It's not the time man, hey! - Wait, what do you mean you didn't get it? I worked on it all last night. I emailed the files to you about an hour ago, so you should've gotten it. - No you didn't David and we need them right now. - Hang on a sec. What the hell? - David we need those files right away. I'm counting on you man. - Yeah, yeah. Um, I will get them right to you, and I'm sorry about that. I'll send them to you now. All right. - Sweetheart? Hello? - Huh? - You feeling all right? - Yeah, yeah, it's just, I thought that, I thought we video-chatted and then I was talking to you and then Al, um, I went to bed. - But did you sleep at all? - I heard those voices again. - Maybe I should talk to work and see if I can get over there sooner. - No, no, no, no, I'm good, it's okay. I'm, it's okay. I just, I need to focus and get this thing done. - If you say so. - Everything's all right, right? I mean, you'd tell me if there was something wrong? - Everything's fine, I'm fine. - Okay. - I'm fine. - How is the, uh, bachelor life? - Uh, you know. Pizza and porn? - Pretty much, yeah. - Yeah, nice. Uh hey, does Laura know about your realtor? - What about my realtor? - C'mon, man. - There's nothing to tell, that was a long time ago. There's literally nothing to tell. - Uh well, let me drop a little knowledge on you. Something that I learned in 14 years of marriage. There's always something to tell. - Not this time. - Okay, all right, I believe you, I guess. - Great. - Good. Listen, I'm just glad you're back in the states, dude. You know, Haley, my daughter? - Yeah? - Is twelve now? Twelve, I'm surprised you remember her. I mean, if you stuck around here, you might have two of your own, dude. - Ooh. - But no, you had to go find a beautiful British chick and move to England and live the dream. Lucky bastard. - Yeah, I did all right I guess. - Yeah, you did all right. - Hey, uh, have You guys done the old uh click click, oh, oh yeah. - Don't ever do that.

Hey baby, you still awake? - Yes, something like that. - Huh, hi Alex, sorry, I thought you were. - Laura, no. I just thought you might be lonely and I wanted to say hi. - No, I'm okay, just working. - God, I just got back from the best workout. My endorphins are racing! - Yeah, wow. - I'm literally going to have to peel these clothes off. They're so confining. I hate being confined, you know, by clothes. But you already know that, right? - Uh yeah, Alex look, I really need to finish composing, so I'm gonna go ahead and just. - Does she even know about us? - What do you mean us? - Really? - That was a long time ago, Alex. - Okay, I'm gonna show you something, I have something. - Whoa, okay please just don't. Oh man. - C'mon, don't you think this was meant to be? You're here in L.A. with me. - No, I love my wife and this means nothing. - Oh, God. This is seriously your loss. - How's your mum? - She's good! Happy I'm closer. Probably because of the phone bill. - Aw, she loves you, you know that. - Yeah, I know. Until, until we have a grand-kid, and then, uh, then it's all over for me. - Well, milk it while you can. How is everything over there? Have you been able to get any rest? - Kind of. Yeah, unless I'm getting used to all the weird noises. I keep misplacing things. I keep losing things, I can't find my toothbrush. - Your toothbrush? How do you lose a toothbrush? You tell me. David, calm down. - No, I, no, I'm not gonna calm down. Cause I don't understand how, I know where I put stuff, but shit's always missing. - Shh, honey please! - I can't ever find anything. - It's five in the morning, just calm down. - No, listen! I'm sorry I just. - David, you need some rest. - Yeah, I guess I do, because I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind right now. Everything, everything's gone! Like there's nothing ever in the same place. - I'm gonna be with you soon, okay? It's gonna be all right, okay? - Yeah, okay great. - Maybe you should call Dr. Sales and see if you can get. - Son of a bitch, Laura! You know what? It's always, it's always about, I knew you were gonna say that. It's always about that. You always think. - Holy shit! - What? - Oh my god, I swear to god I just saw someone behind you. I don't know. - Are you pulling a trick on me right now, because? - No David, I don't know, I saw something. - You saw something like I should leave, or? - No. - You saw something. - No, never mind. - Never mind? - Are you okay? - Are you fucking with me? - What? - I was thinking about this. I know I saw something. Last night when we were chatting, I saw a little girl. Are you sure you're not messing with me? Because really, it's not funny. - I'm not messing with you, I swear. I don't know what you're talking about. - Are you sure you didn't install some sort of ghost app or something on your phone? - No, seriously. - This isn't just some elaborate prank to scare me about our new place? - Okay, now you're starting to kind of freak me out a little bit. I didn't do anything, I haven't done anything and I'm not messing with you, I promise. - All right. It's just, I know I saw something. - That's what's freaking me out! Fine and then we play seven a lot together. - So I'm gonna try to break away and deposit that check today. I just haven't had a chance to do it, I'm sorry, I've been so busy. - Boring. - Oh, and I have some good news and I have some bad news. Apparently you're not crazy. I met our neighbor today. Mrs. Rosalez. Yeah, her English wasn't very good but I gather that she was asking me if I knew that our place was haunted. So there's that. I guess they've had trouble renting the place because of strange occurrences. And people don't stay very long. - Well, why would she say it's haunted? - Something about a little girl named Anna who used to live here. Um, she was sick, she never left her room, she was always alone in the house, and Ms. Rosalez said that she could see her through the window always playing on the computer. - That's sad, but what does that have to do with? - She died here. - Oh my God David, are you serious? Did you talk to the realtor about that? - I'm sorry, is this place haunted, never really came through my mind when I was taking a tour of the place. - Are you saying she died in the house? - Yeah, that's what Ms. Rozales said. - Well, I mean, doesn't the realtor have to disclose that? Isn't that the law? - I guess. Um, you know what, I'll check in with Alex and see what she has to say, how's that? I mean that's all I can do. - Well, let me know. - I will. - That's fine, just let me know what she says. - You're not gonna move in with me now? You're gonna stay in London? - No, I'm still coming. - There's ghosts in London, I'm just saying. They don't scare me. - I love you, I'll talk to you soon. - Okay, love you. - Okay, bye. - I guess ghosts don't make for sexy time. You seem tense. Yes, well, things haven't been going so well between David and me. I probably shouldn't be telling you this. - It's okay. It must be hard with David thousands of miles away. Listen, I have just the thing you need to relax. Mm. - What the fuck? No, no, no, no, fuck this. Oh, shit, oh! - EN Design Solutions? Hello? You're working late. - Director Greer? Hello? Martin? - Uh, I think we got disconnected. You like your work here? - Yes, sir. Is there something I can help you with? No, I don't need anything. - I can barely hear you. Remember what our purpose here is, Martin. - Did I do something wrong? You're meeting expectations. Hello, hello? Sweetheart, what's wrong? - What's wrong, um well, that's a very, very good question, because I don't know what's wrong. But I know something, I know something is wrong. - Sweetie, you have to let me help you if you're feeling too stressed. Did you call and get something to help you sleep? No, no, there's been no sleeping. Um, I having these weird dreams though. - Dreams, about what? - Yeah. Um, well. - About what? I can't help you if you don't tell me, love. I don't know if I want to tell you, okay? That's the thing. I'm not sure if I actually want to talk about it with you. - Just talk to me. That's what I'm here for. - Oh man, they're so weird. - Just tell me, sweetie. - Okay, okay. Uh okay, I had this dream that the video chat was just on, right, and I woke up and I saw that it was on. But the weird thing is that it was coming from the basement, you know? So I go down there and, that was one. And then, well the second one is that, um. I saw you and Charles. - Charles, my boss? - Yeah, yeah. - What about Charles? - Well, you guys were, you were, um. - We were what, David? - You were having sex, right in front of me. Looking directly at me, the whole time. - Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. Look, there just, it's just a dream. It's just a dream. They're just dreams, it's okay. Yeah I know. - We're okay. - I know it's okay. I think the thing is, is that, I don't know what's going on with me right now, and I'm a little, just concerned about it. - Well, is it the place? I mean, can't we find somewhere else to live? Sweetheart? - I'm so tired. So tired. - My love, I think you need to find another place to live. - I don't think we can because I signed the lease. - I don't care about a lease. You have to talk to Alex. Ask her what the deal is with all this Anna stuff. Have you not asked her yet? - No. - I mean there has to be some way. Maybe Ted can help. - You know what, that's actually a really, that's a very good idea, I'm gonna call him. - Good. - Okay. That's a great idea, I'm gonna call Ted! - Sweetheart, I love you. - I love you too. - Please relax, okay? - Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you in a little bit. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Fuck her man, just leave! - I can't. I'm on this film, I need to finish it. Plus I can't even afford to move. My credit's screwed. And if she decides to come after me, then I'm really screwed. - Fuck her! Look man, let me get one of my lackeys on it. Do some research on your place. If there's anything there, they'll find it. - Are you sure, is that cool? - Yeah man, of course! - Okay thank you, I appreciate that. - Yeah look, I don't believe any of this haunted bullshit but, you know, I kind of hope something does turn up. I really don't like that chick. - Yo. - Hey! I hate that! - Me too. - Anyway man, uh, I think this is all bullshit. But it's you. So despite all the drugs I know you did at the Burn in '05, I will look into this, cool? - Yes. - All right. - Again, thank you. And hey, for what it's worth, I don't know if I buy this haunted bullshit either, but you know, maybe we'll just give it some more time and see what pans out I guess. - Yeah, just chill out dude. You know, it'll be cool, we'll be cool. - Thanks dude. - Yeah man, you still haven't showered. Bye. - As far as renter history? Your neighbor was right, this apartment is like a rotating door. Renters in and out every year since '08. And they've all been subletting from the owner. All I could come up with was a name, Hausland? - Never heard of him. What do I do now? - Let me give your realtor estate agent a call. - Okay Ted, listen to me. - What? - If you piss her off, and I'm being dead serious here, she can come after me legally. And I can't deal with that. - Seriously man, relax. - No, seriously man, don't piss her off, Ted. - Let me do my job. Trust me, listen, I'm a professional, bro. - Yeah. - Look at me and look at you. - Your job is to piss people off. That's what you do professionally. I'm begging you, don't do that. - I'll treat it with kid gloves, okay? I'll tiptoe around. I'm gonna put her in her place and let her know your rights, okay? C'mon trust me, trust me. - Oh my God. Director Greer, this is Martin Takagi. I am calling to report some suspicious activity with regard to subject David Cole. Is this a National Security issue Martin? - No sir. Is it a Control Threat? - No sir, there doesn't appear to be, however. Remember what our purpose here is, Martin. - Yes, I understand, but, but. You're doing a good job. Please keep it that way. - Yes sir, I understand. - Hi sweetie, this is a nice surprise. Hello? David? David, are you messing with me? Hello? Hello? - I was chatting with him last night. We logged off and everything was fine. But this morning Becky called and said he was coming up to bed and then he fell down the stairs. - Oh my god. Is he all right? - They don't, I don't know. She said the he had a few broken ribs and that his back was screwed up pretty bad. He can't walk. - My love, are you all right? - I don't know. I want to give Becky a call and see how he's doing. - Oh, about yesterday, I didn't call Dr. Sales. I trust you, David. - Okay. David, what the fuck is this? - What the fuck, what are you talking, hold on. - This is the third time you haven't delivered. Okay, I don't know what's going on with you but we have a schedule to keep. Ray wants you off this thing and I'm doing everything to keep. - I did your mix, Bob. Okay, what are you talking about, it's done, I sent it to you. - This is not acceptable. - Okay, that's not what I sent! I've never even heard that before. - Please David, I am going to bat for you here, okay? This is my ass on the line if we don't get this right! - All right, okay. - All right, talk to you tomorrow. - Great, fuck! I mean, I did the mix and it sounded great! And if I lose this job, we're done, we're done! I just don't know what is going on here. - Sweetheart, it's weird here. - What do you mean? - You know I didn't believe you before, but I'm hearing the voices. They're keeping me up at night. - I want you to go to Jenna's house. - I'm really scared. - I'm sure you're scared. I want you to go to Jenna's house. I'm being dead serious. - I just want you here. - I want to be there, but I can't. I mean, ah fuck. Go To Jenna's please? Please? I don't want you by your self. - Good morning David. You're up early. David? Oh shit! - There's been some really interesting things happening here the last couple days. - Interesting things like what? - Like things disappearing, voices. It's like there's someone here with me all the time. - I don't know if I can do this right now. I don't know if I even want to talk about this right now. - I have to show you something. Hang on. Do you want to play? Here we go! Isn't that amazing? - What are you still doing there? Get out of there right now, Laura! - I don't feel threatened. I think she just wants to play. - What you just showed me, doesn't look like playing. - She's just a little girl. We've been trying for so long to have our own. And we almost did. And I think that she just wants us to love her, to take care of her. - You're talking about a ghost. I can't believe I'm even having this conversation now. - No, it makes sense. I mean that's why all of this is happening. I mean, I didn't understand it before she came here. But now, I see it. She wants a mother. - What, no! - It's okay, she likes me. I heard her call my name. - What are you talking about? - I know how it sounds! - No, you don't know how it sounds, okay? You have no idea how it sounds! And we don't even know if this is even her! - It is! - You want to be the mother of a ghost, really? This is what you're saying to me right now. - You just have to trust me. - Teddy had an accident. And I haven't even had the chance to tell you yet, that Bob had a car accident. My sister is a complete mess right now. So my point is, is that people are getting hurt, okay? - Is he okay? - I don't know. I don't know. Laura, people are getting hurt, okay? - But sweetie, I'm fine. - You don't know that you're fine. Having this conversation, nothing about this, is fine. It's nuts! - Really, I'm okay. I have to go. - Where are you going? No, Laura! Laura come back here, Laura come here! Can we talk for a moment? - Yes, Mr. Director. - You like working here? - Yes, yes I do. - Good, good 'cause you do a really good job, Martin. You're really reliable. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I've just recently read the report, the Anna Document? - You can watch the recordings. - I know, I know. And I will if it ever becomes necessary. I just want you to let you know that I understand. This job isn't an easy one, but it's essential. It's common place for a person in your position to get attached to certain feelings, or have certain feelings. - All right. - And if you ever need anybody to talk to. - All right, but you need watch the recordings. - I will, if it ever becomes necessary. You can take the rest of the day off if you need to. - No, I'm fine. - Excellent. Then I'll let you work. Martin? - Yes, Mr. Director? - Remember our purpose here. - David! - You can drop the fucking act, Alex. Okay, I'm done with this place. I'm packing up and I'm leaving and you can deal with all the details, okay? The one thing that I do expect is for my security deposit to be back in my account within a day. Alex, you have one day. - David, listen to me! You and Laura. - Don't even say her name. You leave her out of this. I'm being dead serious right now. You don't get to say her name. As a matter of fact, we're done. You and I, are completely finished, okay? I don't want you to call Laura, I don't want you to call me. I don't ever want to hear from you again, ever! As far as I'm concerned, you're dead! - A woman was found dead today in her residence. Little is known as to the cause. The police are asking for any information on this man, or to his whereabouts. Please contact them immediately. But no matter where you go, we will find you David. - Hey, hey! Hello, Laura? Hello? Hello! Hello! Laura! Laura? Anna? Anna are you there? Anna, please leave Laura alone. Come back here with me. Anna, come back here with me. Are you there, Laura? Are you there? Shit! This is the Police! Hello, Mrs. Cole are you there? Hello? Mrs. Cole? Hello, Mrs. Cole? Ma'am are you all right? I'm fine! Please come out here so we can talk to you. What the bloody hell is going on? We received an emergency call saying you were in danger. From who? David Cole. That's my husband. David! Have you lost your mind? - I was worried about you. I called your apartment, the computer answered and you weren't even there! - So you called the Police? - Then I thought I was talking to Anna, okay? - Oh my God! - I started talking to her, I thought she was there, I asked her a few questions and all the shit on your desk started moving around. - Have you officially gone insane? - Would you just believe me? Please, I was worried about you Laura! - So you call the Police and have them break down our door? - I didn't know they were gonna break down the door and why is the fucking Police the big deal in this conversation? - Do you have any idea what kind of trouble we could be in? - No, I don't, you know why? Because I don't live there anymore. And I don't fucking know. - That's not fucking funny, okay? - I'm not trying to be funny! - Hi sweetheart. Look, I am so sorry about. David? David! David! David? David? David! David, what the fuck? David! David! Oh my god! - He's mine. I'll never stop 'til he's mine. - David, oh my God! - Hey, hey! - David, listen. - No, no, no, listen I wanted to say first that I am so sorry, baby, I really didn't. - David, stop, stop it! Just listen to me! - What? - David, it's Anna. I think she wants you and Alex to be together. I think that this is all connected to Alex. I mean, I saw the two of you. - What, what are you talking about? I don't know, David. I saw the two of you together. I know that it wasn't real, but it really looked real, David. - Well what happened? - Well we, we video chatted. And then. - What, no! - And then no, no, and then. - Honey, we never, we didn't video chat. We haven't, I haven't with you. - I know, but listen. I think that Anna is trying to sabotage our relationship. I thought at first, you know, I thought she wanted a mother but now I see she's trying to get rid of me, David. Anna is trying to get rid of me! - This is crazy. - I mean, think about it! Think about it! There's Ted, and then Bob. She must've found out how important this job is to us, for us to get started out there. I mean, what else could be the explanation? Is there anything you're not telling me, David? - No, no, I don't think so, no. Ted? - Hey man! - Hey, how you feeling buddy? - Just like I look, like shit! Listen man, I gotta talk to you. I got an email from one of my guys. He sent it from a weird email address, so I just came across it today. You're gonna freak. Alex lived in that house. - What? - She went by her mother's maiden name, Hausland, for some reason. David, Anna was Alex's daughter. - Wait, what? What the hell are you? - I know man, it's messed up. When were you guys together? - 2000, had to have been 2000, in Vegas. - Anna died when she was seven, in 2007. David, there's no way that? - No, no, no, no, couldn't be. - I mean, you used a condom? - Yeah, yes, yes. - Man, she was a crazy chick. You don't think there's any way she got a hold of your man stuff, do you? - No. - Don't look at me like that. They tell NBA players to flush their stuff, you know? - No, no. - Either way man, there is nothing good about that house. Just get out of there, please. - Um Laura called Alex's office and they said she hasn't worked there for three years. - What? David, that's good for you, get out! You are not legally obligated to be there. Just leave. - Hang on. - Yeah. - Hello? She's in the hospital. - What happened? Heart-attack. I can't catch a plane tonight so I'm gonna leave first thing in the morning. - Is she going to be all right? I don't know. This whole thing is so fucked up. - You know, I talked to her this morning and she seemed fine! What, why are you looking at me like that? - You talked to her? You talked to her with everything that's been going on? You actually had a video chat with my mom? - She called me, she was worried about you. - Because you wouldn't answer me! Because you shut me out! - You talked to her too! - After we, we didn't even know that Anna was doing her thing then! It was before we knew that she was crossing over! - Oh my God, this thing is tearing us apart! Oh my God! - What are you doing here? Just stay. We can finally be a family. - David, get out of there, please! Get help! - I can't. - Baby, please! - Alex! - Get out of there! - Alex this is enough! - No, where are you going? - This is enough! Alex, Alex! No, no, no! What's happening? Please come back! Laura! - David! - Laura, get out of there! Get out of there, get out of there! She's not here! Anna's not here, Anna's with you! Anna's with you Laura! You have got to get out of there right now! Get out of there right now, Anna's with you! - Hub, this is Eye, I need a quick connect to the LA County Sheriff's Department.
