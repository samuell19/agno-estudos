(quiet somber music) (phone ringing) - [Fred] Yeah? - [Janet] Oh, Fred, it's me. - [Fred] Oh, hi Jan. - [Janet] I was wondering if you were home yet. Di you just get in?. - [Fred] Yeah I just got home a minute ago. - [Janet] Oh good. Look I just got back to the office. We were held up at a buyer's meeting across town. Sorry I'm late. - [Fred] Yeah, well that's the name of the game isn't it? - [Janet] That's right, unfortunately. Anyway, I'll be leaving here in about five minutes. So I should be home soon. - [Fred] Yeah okay, no rush. - [Janet] Right, bye. (phone ringing) - [Man] Hello? - Is Janet Bates there please? - [Man] I think you must have the wrong number mister. There ain't nobody here at this time of night. - Is this Thread of Design? - [Man] Yes, sir, yeah it is. - This is 532-7812? - [Man] Yes sir yeah. - Then that's Janet's office you're in. - [Man] Well could be. But there's nobody here now. We usually close up at five-thirty around here. I just heard the phone and picked it up. - There's nobody there at all, on the whole floor? - [Man] No sir, there hasn't been anybody here for hours, except me. I'm just cleaning up, you know. - Yeah. Okay thanks. - [Man] Sure, sorry. (light happy music) - Where are we? This isn't highway 27. - Oh I just thought I'd take you on a different route for a change. As a kind of surprise. - Surprise? I thought we were going to Trent? - But we are. Just taking another route that's all. This used to be the main road to Trent. Little deserted now but such a beautiful drive. I thought you'd like it. - Mm. - Take us a couple hours longer to get there but it'll be worth it, you'll see. Oh, beautiful country, completely off the beaten track. - Oh that's just fine but what about George and Pat? Aren't they expecting is around two? - Oh no I told them not to expect us before three or four this afternoon. We've got our lunch. Besides the christening doesn't start til 5:30. What's the rush? Come on Jan. I just wanted to surprise you. You're not mad, are you? - No that's fine. - You know there's this one spot about 20 miles on down the road, you'll just love. Oh I came across it a couple of weeks ago. I was looking for some farmland for that architect, remember? Boy you should see it. (laughs) Hey, well you can see it. We could have a picnic there. It's just a paradise, believe me. (gentle music) Come on Jan, can't wait for you to see this view. (birds chirping) - I don't see any view. - You just wander down that path and you will. Look you go ahead I'll bring the lunch. It's a perfect place for a picnic. - All right anything you say. (bright eerie music) (quiet dramatic music) (dramatic intense music) Where's the lunch? - Oh, (laughs) how do you like that? I forgot it. It's alright I'll go back for it in a second. It's quite a view way, eh? - Yeah it's beautiful. - Remember that deal I said I was working on I thought could be developed into something big? Remember I didn't want to say anything about it till I got some information on it? You remember, I mentioned it a couple of weeks ago? - I remember. - Well this is it. - [Janet] What? - This land. Look around. It's the perfect place to build that little resort motel we've always dreamed about. - Resort motel? Since when did I always dream of owning a resort motel? - Oh come on now you've always said how nice it would be to own some little restaurant or hotel in the country, someplace peaceful like this. - Yeah and I've always dreamed about being a millionaire too. What's that got to do with this place? - Well it's just that, it's possible, it doesn't have to be a dream. If you like the idea, I think we could actually pull it off. We could actually do it right here. I can get a deal on this land that you would not believe. (laughing) It could make the whole thing happen. We could build a few cabins up here, down the river, down there a bit for canoeing and swimming. I didn't want to mention it till I was sure. But now I am sure. I can do most of the work myself, you know, electricity, carpentry, plumbing. I could do practically everything myself. The whole thing probably couldn't come to say more than 40,000 to get it off the ground. - $40,000? Where are you going to get that kind of money? - Well I thought if you like the idea? - If I like the idea what? - Well there's your inheritance and your insurance. - You mean to tell me you brought me all the way out here just to try and con me into financing another one of your harebrained schemes? - It is not a harebrained scheme! I'm not trying to con you! Hell, I just thought as long as we're on our way to Trent, we'd take the old road and see this place. - Like hell. You've had it planned for weeks. - Look for Christ's sake, how can it fail? The land alone is an airtight investment. One full mile along the river like this. - Well if it's such a great idea, why don't you get someone else to back you in it? - I cannot expect someone to back me unless I put up some money myself and I don't have any money, you've got the money! Janet! Now wait a minute. - Fred we have been through this before. I'm not gonna lend you any more money. I'm sorry. - Why the hell not! Marriage is a partnership remember? - Fred you're hurting me please, my arm. - Why won't you lend me the money? Tell me huh? Tell me! - You know why. That money is all I have left. It's the only security I've got. - What about me? Oh I'm not security enough for you. You trying to tell me I can't take care my wife. (Janet gasps) Janet, Janet. (dramatic music) (Fred sighing) What the hell kind of person do you think I am? Do you actually think I'm trying to con you like some cheap hustler? Well do you? What, do you think I want to take your money and use it for my own personal gain? For Christ's sake Janet, we have been married eight years now. Everything I have done has been for the both of us. I just haven't had the breaks, that's all. That's all I need, Janet. Just one break and I know I could really make it. I mean is that really too much to ask? - Is that why you married me? - What? What do you mean? Is that why I married you? - Just exactly what I said. Is that why you married me, so I could give you the breaks you couldn't make yourself. - That's it, rub it in. Come on why don't you say what you really mean? - Leave me alone Fred, you're hurting me! - Come on you want to dump on these and do it right. Let's get it all out, right here and now. - Leave me alone! (dramatic music) Look out! (car horn honking) - What's the matter with you, you're crazy? You almost killed me! - I almost killed you? I almost killed myself trying not to kill you, you jackass! Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play in the road? - What are you some kind of wise guy? Wait a minute buddy. Nobody talks to me like that and gets away with it! - Fred, for Christ's sake, what do you think you're doing? Fred! - All right mister, forget it, it's not worth it. (dramatic music) (car horn honking) (birds chirping) - Hiya (laughs), I'll be right with ya. Hello there, how you doin'? - Oh, just fine, just fine thanks. A beautiful day today, isn't it? - Oh it sure is you know. We ain't had a drop of rain around here in weeks. (laughs) Soon as the tourist season's over it gets fine. (both laughing) - That's always the way, isn't it? - Every year, every year. - Listen is that sign if yours true? Is this really the last gas station for a 80 miles. - Well it sure is. Well, what do you have? - Um, fill it up make it super. - [Attendant] Super. - That must be pretty good for you though. I mean you must get all the business that comes through here. - Fat lot of business that is. Yeah, lucky for me I've only got my own mouth to feed. This time of the year after, Labor Day, you can go for days without seeing a car on this road. - But what about the people who live around here? I mean they must have to travel a long way for gas. - Hardly any of them are there. (laughs) There's a few of us stickin' it out. The people across the way there. There's a young couple got a farm about 20 miles further on. They seem to be doing all right. But let's face it. What is there to stay here for? There's nothing but trees and rocks. - Well it's a pretty country to look at anyway. - (laughing) Yeah, it is, if you like trees and rocks. (both laughing) Well, thank ya. You know, I always enjoy having a chat with a customer. Where you from? - [AI] I'm from Appleby about 400 miles from here. - Oh, that's nice. Sort of having a late summer vacation are ya? - Oh yeah, yeah, that's it exactly. A long needed vacation. - Well how do you like that I don't get a customer all day then two drive up at once. (car horn honking) - That guy practically forced me off the road a few miles back. He jumped right out in front of me. - Oh, is that a fact? Well it's not hard to do all these roads. (car horn blaring) All right, all right, all right! Goo afternoon, how you doing? - I'm fine thank you. Do you have a ladies room I can use? - Yeah sure there's a bathroom just in there, go in there and go through the dining room, you'll see it. - Thank you. - Fill 'er up sir? Sir? - (sighs) Yes fill it up. - Yes, sir. - And do the windshield. - Yes, sir - I'm sorry if we caused you any trouble back there. My husband shouldn't have jumped out in the middle of the road like that. It was unforgivably stupid. He's kind of out of sorts this morning. He was awfully rude to you. There's no excuse of course, I can only apologize, I'm sorry. - That's all right. There was no harm done. - That'll be $12, sir. - $12? (Fred sighs) Here. - Thank you sir. - Tell my wife to move her ass. We haven't got all day. - Yes, sir. - Well watch out for kids playing on the road. - Okay, yeah you too. - Don't worry, I will. - Ah, I think your husband's getting a little impatient, ma'am. He asked me to, uh-- - Thank you. I heard him. Well have a nice weekend. - [AI] Thanks same to you. - So that's the fella that gave you all the trouble on the road eh? - Hmm, oh yeah, that's him. - Well, I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised at all. - His wife seemed kind of nice though. - Yeah, more's the pity. Well we never know the whole story do we? (engine revving) Well, is there anything more I can do for ya, sir? - Um, I think I'll have a chocolate bar for the road and then I better get a move-on. - Well, you take your pick. They're all stale as hell anyway. (both laughing) (dramatic music) - Do you have to drive so fast? This isn't exactly a super highway. - Don't tell me how to drive. If you don't like it get out and walk. - I'm sorry for what I said back there about why you married me. It was a really stupid thing to say and I didn't mean it. We don't have much of a marriage left do we. (Fred laughs) Well surely you can see that? - That's why you won't lend me the money because you think there's something wrong with our marriage? - Fred, there is something wrong with our marriage and if you felt anything for me at all you would have known it by now. - What the hell are you talking about? You make it sound like it's my fault there's something wrong with our marriage. If there's anything wrong between us it's you baby all you. - You're incredible. How can you sit there and say something as totally stupid as that? - Stupid? You honestly think I don't know you've been cheating on me all these months. Did you honestly believe that? Well are you gonna deny it? - No I'm not gonna deny it. - That's why you won't lend me the money. You have a lover you're planning on leaving me aren't you? - Fred I wouldn't lend you that money if I had a lover or not. I was telling you the truth. - [Fred] You're gonna leave me aren't you? - Fred. - [Fred] You're gonna run off with him. - You're driving too fast. - Answer me damn it! Are you planning on leaving me? - Fred, you're gonna go off the road! (Janet screaming) (metal crunching) - Jan. Janet. (dramatic music) (Fred laughing) - [Janet] Fred. Fred. Help me. Help me please. I'm bleeding. Get me loose. Fred. Please. Please. Please. (crying softly) Please. Please. Help me. - [Fred] Goodbye, Janet. (dramatic music) - Fred. (dramatic music) - [AI] No, no. - Please help me. I'm bleeding. - Right don't worry I'll help you. Where's your husband? Is he all right? - He left me. He just left me here to die. (Janet groaning) (birds chirping) (Janet moaning) - Listen to me, there might not be anyone along here for days. I don't know, I know I shouldn't move you but I've got to get you to my car. It's the only way I can get you to a doctor. It's gonna hurt. But I'm gonna carry you up this ravine. - Okay please. (Janet moaning) (Janet whimpering) - Hang on, honey, I'll get you to the doctor as fast as I can. (Janet whimpering) Here we go. I'll have you in a hospital in no time. (engine whining) )engine whining) I looked in the engine but I don't know what's wrong. I don't know anything about cars or engines. I don't know what to do. - Do something, please do something. - I will don't worry I will. Look, , I'm gonna have to leave here for a while. I'm gonna go up the road this way to see if there's anybody living nearby. Now look I passed them a farm about four or five miles back that way. I know I can probably get you some help there but it's a hell of a long way. So I'm gonna go up this way first to see if I can find anybody. All right. I'll be back in just a few minutes. Take it easy all right. (dramatic music) (man breathing heavily) (hood thuds) (dramatic music) (Janet whimpering) (intense music) (dramatic music) (Janet crying) Who was it? Who did this? Was it your husband? - He tried to smother me. Please, please don't leave me. He'll come back. - I just can't let you lie here. I've gotta go for help. - He'll come back and kill me. He'll come back and smother me to death. Please don't leave me. - I won't leave you alone here. Don't worry. - Oh thank you, thank you. Someone will come, someone will help us. (intense music) (dramatic music) What is it? - It's nothing it's all right. - Where am I? - You had an accident, remember? - [Janet] Oh, how long ago? - Over two hours. - Two hours. I'm dying. - Don't say that. Everything will be all right. Someone will come along don't worry. - No, it's too late now. He did it. He's taken everything from me, everything he ever wanted even my self-respect, money, everything. He got it anyway. - If it's the last thing I do I'll see him pay for this. I'll see him pay. Please don't let her die. Please don't let her die. (dramatic music) (Janet gasping) (birds chirping) He murdered her. Murderer! I'll get you for what you've done! (dramatic music) (bright music) - [Dan] Laura! (birds chirping) (phone buzzing softly) (crows cawing) (birds chirping) - Hey! (Fred moaning) What is it? - [Fred] Help me, mister. - What is it, what's happened? - [Fred] An accident. We were forced off the road. My wife's caught in the wreck. I couldn't get her out. I tried, I couldn't get her out. I couldn't get her out. - Laura! Laura! - What is it? You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. There's been an accident on the main road. You say somebody forced you off the road? Where? - [Fred] I remember trying to miss the bridge and we flipped. And my wife. You've gotta help my wife. - [Dan] Don't worry, we'll help her. - She's bleeding to death, I couldn't get to her. - Come on, let's get you inside. - What's ever happened? - It's crazy. He says somebody forced him off the road. His wife's still caught in the wreck. - [Laura] Oh my God, no. - I can't believe it, I can't. So he threatened me, he said some terrible things to me, but I didn't think he'd actually do something like that. - He threatened you, why? - Well, I , did something stupid. I stepped out in the highway, and he swerved, he went in the ditch trying to not to hit me. He was so, he was upset. He said he'd do the same to me if he ever saw us again and he did. He's killed my wife. He's murdered her, I know it. He was like some kind of maniac. He came back. I must have been in shock I don't know. I ran. He was trying to finish me off. And now he's committed murder. He's desperate. - All right, just sit down. - Dad maybe you should take your gun. - What for? I'll be all right. Where's the first-aid kit? - Upstairs in the hall closet. - Right, I'll just get some blankets off the bed. - You're right lady. Don't let him go without a gun. If he does you may never see him again. - [Laura] Oh my God. - Take one of those rifles off the wall, load it and give it to him when he comes down. - Okay. - Don't let him leave without it. - Did you phone the police? - No, not yet. - Why not? - Dan, please take this. - Look I told you honey, I don't need it. Nobody wants to hurt me. - Mister do as she says. That man is off his head. He could do anything. - Dan please, please don't take a chance like that. - All right but I can't take that thing. I'm not hunting a wild animal. Get me the .22. - Okay. Is the clip loaded? - Yeah, it's loaded. Thanks. - Dan please be careful. - Don't worry, honey, I'll be all right. Just look after him and phone the police right away. Okay? - Yeah okay. - Okay. (Fred moaning) - [Laura] What is it? Are you all right? - My stomach. Could you could you get me a drink of water or something? - Sure. (engine revving) - Oh, that's better. Thanks. - I'll heat up some water and clean those cuts. - Please lady telephone the police or something. We've got to get help to my wife. - Oh my God, I forgot. I'll call the operator, that'll be the quickest. What's wrong with this thing? I can't get a tone. It's dead, the phone's dead. It's dead. - What? - [Laura] I can't get a tone. - But that's impossible it's got to work. It's just gotta work. Oh my God. It doesn't work. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) Keep trying. They may fix it any minute. (engine revving) - [AI] Thank God someone finally come. - The woman's dead. - I know. - Why didn't you try to help her. Why didn't you take her into town or something instead of just letting her lie there. - Jesus Christ mister I tried to help her but her husband stopped me. He wanted her to die. He tried to kill her. He did kill her and he kept me from going for help. He murdered her. - What the hell are you talking about? - He just left her here to die. She told me herself and he kept me from going for help. He fixed my car so it wouldn't work. - What do you mean he fixed your car? Did you see him do it? - No, how could I? I was down there getting her out of the wreck, trying to stop her bleeding. - Then how do you know he fixed your car? - Jesus Christ mister I saw him try to kill her! - You what? - I went for help on foot. I thought there was a farm up the road. I didn't find anything so I turned around and I came back and that's when I saw him. - Saw him what? - Running from the car down the ravine. I just caught a glimpse of him. I was in kind of a daze. I didn't figure out exactly what was going on. The car started moving down the hill. I ran after it and managed to get it stopped. She was choking, gasping in the backseat. I gave her artificial respiration. He tried to smother her while I was gone. She died clutching my hand while that bastard sat out there watching us waiting for her to die - He was at my farm trying to get help for her. - What? - It's an hours walk to my farm from here. He arrived there about a half hour ago. That gives him around an hour and a half that he wasn't here keeping you from going for help. - I don't believe it. He was here. I know he was. He tried to kill her. - The keys to the car where are they? - Inside. (engine revs) - Why don't you just sit down and keep quiet. We got a bit of a wait before the police get here. (phone clicking) - Still dead. It's been almost an hour now. - That's it. Too late now. - It's not too late. We'll still get through. - She's been out there over two hours. She'll have bled to death by now. - But Dan can stop the bleeding. He knows all about first aid. - He does? - Yeah he studied it. He knows all about it. - Maybe I better go back. Your husband's been waiting for the police, I better tell him we couldn't get through. - [Laura] But you can't. Dan has a truck you'd have to walk. - I walked here I can walk back. - [Laura] If somebody has to go, I'll go. What about your knee? You'd never make it you're too weak. - No, maybe so, but I've got to go to my wife. Besides you better stay here for the phone. - Yeah, but your leg! - I'm sorry. I've got to go to her. I can't take sitting around here any longer. (dramatic music) - Look mister, I don't know why the car works now and it wouldn't work before. You think I'd have sat around here if I'd known it would work? That bastard. Somehow he planned it this way. There wasn't anything I could do, don't you see? I thought he was out there waiting to get her. It doesn't matter whether he was or not. We were both sure he was gonna come back and kill her. - Yeah, like I said tell it to the police. - The police? To hell with the police. We could sit here all day and wait for the police. What about that maniac? What's he doing right now? - [Dan] I told ya shut up. - Don't you have a wife or a kid on that farm of yours? Aren't you the least little bit worried that he might do something like this all over again? It's the work of some kind of madman. Think about it. Damn it all, think about it! - A murderer wouldn't have begged me to phone the police and get help up here. You think about that. - Fantastic! So where's the police? Where's the help? We've been sitting here for an hour now. - Maybe that trouble getting through to them. Sometimes we have trouble with our line. But they'll be here. - What do you mean sometimes you have trouble with your line? Didn't you phone for the police? - No I didn't phone the police. - Then who phoned? - My wife did of course. - Did you see her phone? - No I didn't see her phone. I was in my truck and gone before she picked up the receiver. - You mean you left her the phone for the police? With that killer in the house with her! - Hold it right there buddy. Don't get wise with me. I don't trust you for one second. (cans clattering) (birds chirping) - Well why don't you go back to your farm and see if anything has happened. If nothing has happened you could take us both into the police. If something has happened, the sooner you get back to your wife the better. - Yeah, and leave you here on your own so you can skip off. Like hell. - Well take me with you. For God's sake you've got the gun. - Look we both know the chance I'd be taking getting into that truck with you. - Jesus, mister, what about the chance your wife is taking. Doesn't she mean anything to you? You're taking a lot bigger chance with her life than you are with your own. - All right, get in the truck. You drive. Don't try anything funny. - Don't worry, mister, don't worry. (dramatic music) (phone buzzing) - [Laura] Hello Kitty? - [Kitty] I'm sorry would you speak louder? I can't hear you. - Kitty, it's me Laura, Laura Lawson. - [Kitty] Oh hi, Laurie, how are you doing? - Kitty, Kitty, I'm in trouble, I'm in awful trouble. - [Kitty] What, what is it? - Kitty, there's a man on the farm and I think he's killed someone. There's been an accident and he did something to the phone and the knife, I don't know what happened. But I didn't put it there Kitty, I put it back on the counter and it's here and I know I didn't put it there. Kitty he's out here on the farm with me, you've got to get the police. Please call the police and get them here right away. - [Kitty] Okay, I'll put you right through. - Hurry. (dramatic music) (Laura screaming) You fixed the phone didn't you? - Just take it easy. I never touched the phone. I just came back because I couldn't get through the woods. I was too weak. - You didn't want us to get hold of the police. You knew your wife was bleeding to death in that car and you kept us from phoning. - Now wait a minute. I never stopped you from phoning for the police. What are you trying to do to me? - You wanted her to die. - What are you saying? - And you stay away from me. - Now look, just put that gun down. Somebody's gonna get hurt. (phone ringing) (Laura groaning) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) Holy Jesus. Now wait a minute, I. You've got it wrong. I didn't mean to hurt you. It was an accident. An accident, I. Please. Don't do this to me. Don't need to see. (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (gun clicking) (engine revving) - [Dan] Okay get out. - [AI] Is it always this quiet around here? - [Dan] What do you expect a brass band? Get inside. Laura, Laura. Get moving. Laura? Oh no. (dramatic music) Oh my God. Get the shotgun off the wall. The shells are in the drawer. (dramatic music) Laura? Laura! Laura! Where are you! Answer me! Laura? Oh. Laura! (gun firing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (intense music) (dramatic music) (chains clinking) (gun firing) (somber music) - No. No. Oh my God. No! No! (sobbing) (dramatic music) - I saw it. You killed her. You killed them all. My wife was in your car. You killed them all. (laughing maniacally) (men groaning) (AI screaming) (Fred screaming) (dramatic music) Kill me like you did the others. Yeah, they'll know you did it. You did it. They'll know you killed them all. You hear me! Murderer! Murderer! (blows thudding) (Fred groaning) (AI screaming) (somber music) (AI yelling) (Fred chuckling) (birds chirping) (engine revving) - [Detective] Have you seen Polansky? - Well yeah he's up at the house. Well no there is now. - Oh right, thank you. Hey Sam. I checked those two cars out. But the one of the ravine's have complete write-off. But the other one seems to be all right. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. - What about the engine? Look like anybody was tampering with it? - I didn't want to poke around with it too much but looked okay to me. - Hm. - Hm. - What a hell of a mess. - Yeah. - You got one of the boys down by those two cars haven't ya? - Yeah Brady's over there and I'm gonna take Fred down too, okay. (radio chattering) - Morrison. Now bring that guy over here. I want to talk to him again. Your car works fine, nothing wrong with it. - I know, I told you it would. - (sighs) Look I'll be honest with you mister, I don't get it. You thought the car didn't work but it does. You thought that guy was hiding in the bushes near the ravine but really he was here five miles away. You thought it was him in the barn and you shot at him but it was Laura Larson and you killed her. And you say that the farmer thought his wife phoned the police hours ago but she hadn't because for some reason she couldn't get through to us. It seems like everybody's been pretty confused around here and I'll tell you one thing mister, I'm more confused than anybody else and that's not too good for you because if I stay confused you could go to prison for the rest of your goddamn life. - I told you the truth. I know it doesn't make any sense but I swear to God everything I told you was true. - Okay, Morrison. I'm holding the other guy for careless driving and leaving the scene of an accident. Take this one in and book him on suspicion of murder. Get a written statement. - Yes sir, come on. - But wait a minute listen to me. - Come on. - This can't happen to me. I'm telling you the truth. I didn't murder anyone. I tried to save that woman's life. You gotta believe me, I'm telling you the truth. - Look, mister, if you're telling the truth then you got nothing to worry about. It's as simple as that. Get in. - 2-0-1 to control. - [Control] Control, come in 2-0-1, over. - Bringing in the suspect from the Lawson farm. I should be there in about 45 minutes. - [Control] Roger, 2-0-1, Control out. - Look mister, like I said if you're telling the truth, you've got nothing to worry about. Now Chief Inspector Polanski's a good cop and if there's anything out there to prove you're innocent he'll find it. - What if it doesn't find anything? - You just better pray that he does, that's all. - Well I'll start with the barn, you take the house. I want an inventory of that dining room. Complete, right away. Bring the print man with you. Have him dust that phone inside and out for prints. And when he's got it apart see if he can tell if anybody's been screwing around with it. - Okay, good. Hey Sam, just out of curiosity. How did you book that other guy? What's his name, Bates? - I haven't booked him yet. I'm holding him on a careless driving charge and leaving the scene of an accident. - For the time being. - You got it. - Yeah well it sure is a hell of a mess. - I know. I already said that.
