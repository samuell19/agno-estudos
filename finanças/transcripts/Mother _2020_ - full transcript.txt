Shuhei! You're not at school? I ditched work too. Come. Ready?! No jumping! Okay. Go ahead and jump. Hurry up. Hey! No jumping! Shuhei! Dad! I know you're in there! Open up! Dad! You don't like me. You. You too. All I want is a little money! Don't listen to her, Mom. She hasn't paid me back either. Over 200,000 yen. Shut up, you snob! I give Mom some money every month. You're teaming up against me. Why are you so spiteful? Because of how you treat me! You don't think I'm good enough. Since I was a kid. Akiko. You only cared about Kaede! I didn't go to college. You used all their money! You never studied. You had bad grades. So what?! Stop it! Mom… Please… Lend me some money. I'll never ask again. I'm getting a new job. It pays really well. No, Mom. She'll gamble it away. Forget it. You're not getting another penny. Cool. Wanna try? No thanks. It's easy. - No. I'll watch. - Go on. - Me? - Yeah. Really? I'm tired. Show me. Seriously? - This way. - Here? All right. Let's drink. You bet I will. I'm not finished yet. Big drinker. What was that? Italy. Never been there. A host at a host club? Really? Yeah. You don't believe me? Your name again? You're kidding. It's Ryo. Stay here tonight. I'm staying with a friend but we got into a fight. No more money. Gotta go back to Nagoya. When? Today. No more trains. Then tomorrow. No way! Don't go. We're having so much fun. I live there. Don't go! I have to! I gotta go! I'm out of cash. No, no, no… Aren't you hungry? Shuhei, boil some water. Hey! Boil some water. No hot water. No instant noodles. Are you serious? Go buy some. Use the hot water at the store. You wanna eat? I do. You know what? I should go to Nagoya with you. - Stop it. - Your kid? - Huh? - What about your kid? - Not now… - Come on… Hey. He's not back yet. Mr. Tanaka already spent his benefits? That's no good. No good at all. Okay. I'll be back soon. Yeah. Mr. Ujita, sorry for calling out of the blue. I'm using my lunch break. Ms. Misumi… I have to go west on urgent business. - West? - Yes. Will you take care of Shuhei for a little while? Huh? You were so nice about the child support allowance. You're the only one I can depend on. So please. Do this for me. All right. How about a kiss? Shuhei! Why not?! Mr. Ujita will take care of you. Mr. Ujita, take him to your place. I'll be back soon. See you, Shuhei. Shuhei! I'm coming in. Are you here? Say something, Shuhei. I'm sorry I can't let you stay at my house. No hot water. No gas. No word from your mom? No. Where did she go? I don't know. Who is she with? A man? Go to school. You should study. Yeah. You're okay by yourself, right? Yeah? I'll come see you again. Where are you, Mom? Come home. You alive? Send me some money right away. Or I can't go home. See ya. Yay! There you are, Akiko. Drink! Drink! Drink up, hottie! Hottie! Hottie! Hottie! ATM Hello, customer. 6 DAYS LATER - Hi, Shuhei. - Shuhei! No lights. Are you serious? What took you so long? I sent you money. Don't be an idiot. It wasn't enough. I sent everything I had. Where's the money your aunt gives you? I bought food. Why?! Go to Ujita's house! Keep it down! He doesn't want kids at his house. He said that? Welcome back, Akiko. Hello, Shuhei. Hello. - Coffee with cream. - Yes, sir. You were gone a long time. Wasn't she, Shuhei? Who are you? I'm her man. You violated Shuhei, didn't you? You took advantage of him while Akiko was away. Shuhei told us in tears. No… Shuhei, tell them it isn't true. It hurt, right? Mr. Ujita hurt you, didn't he? Shuhei, don't lie. A city official assaulting a little kid?! You're unforgivable! Think about his emotional trauma! Huh?! Wait a second… We're going to your office tomorrow. Right, Shuhei? You're going to be brave, aren't you? You're going to tell everybody what he did. A grown single man who's not popular with women. Nothing wrong with that. But keep your hands off a kid. Got it?! We're gonna make you pay. I didn't do anything, Ms. Misumi. This man is fooling you, Ms. Misumi. Shut up! I'll set fire to this fancy house! Bring us the money! We want compensation! Then we'll keep quiet. Mr. Ujita, the medical expenses will cost around 100,000 yen. Where are you going?! To get the money. Maybe 500,000? Could be. He has ice cream bars. Let's go to an amusement park. Shuhei, your first time, right? We'll go on all sorts of fun rides. It'll be fun. Your mom and I are getting married. We decided. I'm your dad now. What? Didn't you hear me?! I'll decide who my dad is. What's the matter with you? You're an idiot! I decide if I'm going to raise you as my son! You're a burden. Say thank you. Say, "Thanks, Dad." He won't. He's taking so long. Hey! What's going on? Come on. What are you doing?! You can't make Akiko happy! Watch out! No! Don't! Shit. That hurt. Move! 2 WEEKS LATER When are you getting paid? I only started working ten days ago. So when? Stop nagging. End of the month. I can't use my cell phone. I can't read the news. I wish he'd rot and disappear. Hey. Work faster. Here's some leftovers from work. Crab and other seafood. Let's eat. Go ahead. Nice. Yum. Hello? Akiko? What's going on? Ujita from the city office came to the house looking for you. He said he couldn't get a hold of you anywhere. What did you do? You're lying. Why would I lie? Shuhei, let's go! That guy isn't dead! Are you serious? Totally. And I doubt he'll report us. Sweet! We lucked out! We didn't have to run away. So now what? Huh? We don't have to stay here anymore. Akiko! 10 DAYS LATER Shuhei! Come and join us! Hurry up! This bathroom is great. I love it. I wanna stay here forever. We need more money. Go get it! Get in. You smell like shit. Damn, you stink. Stinky. Hey. Hey. Let's do it. Hey. Wake up. Hey. Hey. Let's do it. You don't give up, do you? Hello. We'll be back again tonight. All right. I'll keep it for you. Mr. Akagawa, I have a small favor. Will you let me know if the police stop by? My son won't go to school. He doesn't fit in. I'd rather not deal with the authorities. He has to get used to other people, but he's a difficult boy. I was teased as a kid because my family ran a love hotel. I understand. But I always felt comfortable when I was with my parents. Family business? Yes. Did you peep into the guest rooms when you were a kid? No… Of course not. You don't have to lie. You can peep into my room anytime. What? All right then. See you again tonight. Shuhei. I'm going on a school trip, but we have no money. I pay child support every month. Mom said we're broke. How much do you need? Around 30,000 yen. I send 50,000 a month. Hey… You need a haircut. You're a mess. Isn't she working? Shuhei. Come live with me. What do you say? I want to stay with Mom. You sure you're okay? It's all I have. What was that for?! What do you want? School? I'm busy right now. Mom wants to borrow some money again. She already owes me over 200,000. Tell her to pay me back first. She has to pay me back before she borrows more. She has a new job, and we need money to move. She's lying. Tell her I'm not fooled. How did it go? She said no. Why? Didn't you cry? We wasted money on train fare. Are you crazy using your own child like this?! I never want to see you again. Don't even call me. Stay away from my house! Ow… I think I'm pregnant. Pick them up. Shuhei. Want these? 5TH GRADE MATH DRILLS You're not going to school. How do you know it's mine?! You went to other host clubs in Nagoya! That hurt! Get an abortion! I don't care what you say! I'm having the baby! It's mine! Asshole! What the hell?! Stop it! Bitch! Ow… You little brat. That hurts! Stupid punk! You shouldn't be picking a fight with me! You need to discipline the little snot more properly! You're having another kid?! I'm fed up with you two. I'm out of here! Wait! Forget it. It'll never work! Hello… Are you okay? Shuhei, go buy me something. Go get a beer. Cool, huh? I hope this helps. Shuhei, go inside. How is it? Do you like it? Pretty comfortable. Like a secret hideout for kids. No way. We can't live there. Why can't we stay in one of the empty rooms? Sorry. We'll go see your grandma. That old hag. I'm scared of her. We don't have a choice! Ryo, that jerk… He really left us. Damn him… I was dumped by a scumbag. Hey… Shuhei… Ouch… Do you still have the money the Sakuraba woman gave you? Gone a long time ago. Shuhei, you go. Your grandma makes me wanna puke. Go, Shuhei. Go see your grandma. What's the matter? Mom thinks she's pregnant. What? Who's the father? She needs money. She's lying. She's lying to get money from us. It's the truth. I don't believe it! I didn't raise her to be like this! Always broke. Gets pregnant all the time. She disappoints me! You too! Go away! I'm disowning her. Don't ever come here again! I can't stand it anymore! What are you doing? Just a small amount. How could you?! I said you're pregnant, but it didn't work. The old bitch… Why? Why? Hey! Why didn't it work? Should I try again? Shuhei. 5 YEARS LATER Fuyuka! Let's go back. I still wanna play. No. Mom will get upset. Where are we going back to? I don't know. Let's go find Mom. We'll eat with Mom. Shuhei… I'm hungry. She might be playing pachinko. I'm so hungry… Don't cry. Please stop crying. Let's go look for Mom. Piggyback ride. Excuse me. May I have a word with you? Let me touch you. You have a fever. We're done. Follow me. Shuhei! Fuyuka! Let's go. Ms. Misumi! Don't touch me! - Please sit down! - Let go of me! - Calm down! - Don't touch me! Everything's okay. Go away! Keep your hands off me! Take it easy. Calm down. It's all right. Here. You used to receive welfare benefits. Why did you stop? A young daughter… Are you thinking about your children? They're my kids. I can do whatever I want! Think carefully. At this rate, we'll have to take custody of them. Hold my hand. Okay. You dropped this. Over here. Hold on. Mattress! It feels so nice. Shuhei… Would you like to go to school? A "free school" for teens. Don't talk to him without my permission. You'll get bullied, no matter where you go. Here it is. Teacher. - Good. - Thank you. Okay, class. Let's take a group photo. With Shuhei. Wear whatever you want. Come on, guys. Gather in the middle. Are you ready? Smile. Shuhei, smile. Say, "Cheese." Your turn. Go ahead. Hold on. Shuhei? You've grown! Who's that? My sister. Shuhei, I'm hungry. Go buy me some food. Let's go. What do you want? I missed you. Your phone's out of service. You were hard to find. I thought you were dead. That girl… She's mine, isn't she? She's my daughter! Go away! I have no place to go! I don't care! Get out of here! Go! Leave me alone! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! See that? I'm an expert pull hitter. What did you think? - Good. - Huh? You're good. Should we go to the arcade? Fuyuka, come on. Let's go. There you go. Never been there. Never been to a hot spring? We should go. Hakone? Never heard of Hakone? Everybody knows Hakone. The place for the New Year's marathon race. I wanna play on the slide. You played enough on it today. I want to again tomorrow. Let's make a castle in the sandbox. Here we are. Are you okay? No! I'm not ready to go home! - I want more. - I'm exhausted. - Goodbye. - Amazing man, you… Thanks a bunch. It's time to go now. Bye, Akiko. You're going home? Bye-bye. Hey, what are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Hey… Hey! Hey! What's the matter with you?! Ouch! Let go of me! Come here! Ow! You're hurting me! You bitch! Who was that old geezer?! Ow… This, huh? Right? Does it hurt? Want more?! Ow! Ow! Ow! Let's go. Leaving again? What do you think? Don't go. Is that how you write "Aya"? Yeah. Does it look difficult? That's good. What should I ask first? About your future? What's your dream? What kind of job? I don't know. Right… I see. Eat. Ms. Takahashi… Call me Aya. Aya, why did you choose this job? I spent my childhood like you guys. I was physically abused. I grew up in an orphanage. But I'm here today, thanks to people who were good to me. It's fun growing up. You learn a lot. You also have the choice of living away from your mom. Something more grown-up? Grown-up but cute. What do you want? I want a ball. Like a soccer ball? You like soccer. If we get a soccer ball, we can all play together. Let's. Going somewhere? Job placement agency. - Until what time? - I don't know. I have to pretend I'm looking for work to get the benefits. A pain in the ass. Don't go to school. Take care of Fuyuka. Again? You can quit school now. "When she cried, she wiped her tears on the cat's back. One day, the cat died on the girl's back. It was strangled by the baby sling." It's Aya. - Hello. - Hello. May I come in? I brought you some books. They're used but… I want this one. They look difficult. I'd better study. You'll do fine. Thanks for the meal. The room looks cleaner. Hello. Huh? I brought books. Shuhei likes to read. There's some for Fuyu… Fuyu? Her name is Fuyuka! Akiko… Akiko! Who do you think you are? I'm sorry. I'll leave. Shuhei! Going somewhere? Debt collectors. Let's go. Hurry up. Is it okay if I don't go? What? Can I stay here? And do what? Go to school. Don't be stupid. You guys can go. I want to go to school. No matter what that bitch said, nobody likes you. She said you're creepy. You're horny for her, aren't you? She also said you stink. You sure do. AYA, I'M SORRY. SHUHEI Akiko, I have to go. This is as far as we can go. It's time. We have to stick together… I can't. They're going after my dad and brother. They'll be fine. You're next. I can't do that to you. Don't worry about it. Where are you?! We're gonna kill you! Get off my back! Kill me if you can! You're a dead man, you hear?! And your family, we'll... I have to go. Shuhei, take care of Fuyuka. Okay? Another thing. Your mom… She's a fine woman after all. Damn… I have more… He asked me… to take care of Fuyuka. He'll be back soon. It's how our relationship works. Another one. Damn these age spots. What should I do?! Ryo will come back, won't he?! He will, right?! You're all I have now. Only you. 6 MONTHS LATER He's there again? Aren't you eating? I'm fine. I can't have you passing out on the job. Excuse me. Um… May I borrow some money? If I give you another advance, you'll get nothing on pay day. You're also paying rent. Wait for your bonus, okay? Just 30,000 yen. Please. Why do you need an advance every month? My mom's cell phone bills… No more advances. But you can eat for free. Okay? Hi. Did you get an advance? No. Why the hell not?! I couldn't! Stop gambling. You're telling me what to do? Maybe one day, Fuyuka and I might disappear. Go ask him again. It was you, huh?! I knew it! Hey! Why did you do it? Come with me. You're a negligent mother! That's why he's up to no good! You're not even looking for a job! I'm in pain… My legs… You walk to the pawn shop with the stuff Shuhei steals! Stop making excuses! I don't make him steal! I don't believe you! You're a mother! Their mother, aren't you?! A mother should work for her kids! Cook meals and provide for them until they're grown up! That's what a mother does! Thank you for inviting us. Make yourself at home. Let me help. I'll do that. Mr. Matsuura. I apologize… for everything. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Forget about it. You can start working the day after tomorrow. Are you married? My wife passed away. I'm sorry. You must be lonely. MESSAGE FROM RYO: AKIKO, HELP ME AKIKO, HELP ME 500,000 YEN BY TOMORROW OR THEY'LL KILL ME AKIKO, HELP ME There's cash in the safe. - No. - Just do it. We shouldn't! They'll kill him! That's it? It's not enough. Where are we going? I'm hungry. There's money at that old hag's place. What? Grandma's? If you kill her, we'll have money. Yeah. So… what you said earlier… Can you actually do it? Do what? Grandma. Oh… Can you or can't you? Can you? Can't you? We have no money. There's no other way. You have to, or Fuyuka will die. Do I really have to? Shuhei, let's play. Not now. Come on, Shuhei. Let's play. Sorry. I can't right now. Remember what I said yesterday. - Shuhei… - I said I will. Tell me how. I don't know… How long will it take? An hour or so? Too long. We've come this far. It's too late to back out. I know. Will Grandpa and Grandma recognize me? Go. Coming. Please… Hold on. Who's there? May I help you? Shuhei? Come on in. Shuhei, stay for dinner. What happened to the baby? Did she have it? Yeah… A little sister. So it was a girl. A little sister, huh? I want to meet her. She's cute. You should meet her. We'd love to. Wouldn't we? Yes. What is it? Shuhei! What are you doing?! You did it. In the double homicide of an elderly couple in Saitama, their 17-year-old, unemployed grandson has been arrested. He is charged with breaking into their house and stabbing them to death with a knife. 5 MONTHS LATER Me? I never told him to kill them. Listen, Akiko. Shuhei would never do that unless you told him to. He's smart and extremely motivated to study. If only he'd gone to school… You pushed him too far. He… tells lies sometimes. You have no proof, do you? That I told him to kill them. Do you or don't you? You and Shuhei are codependent. Weren't you using Shuhei in order to get money? You know what? I can raise him however I want. I'm his mother, after all. I gave birth to him. He's my flesh and blood. Don't you get it? I gave him all the love a boy could ask for. I can raise my own child however I see fit. Why is that a problem? He's my son. The police believe… that your mother collaborated in the murder-robbery. But… she wasn't there at the scene of the crime. If she denies it, it's difficult to prove her involvement. Um… Will you explain it to me in easier words? I never finished grade school. This case… rests on whether or not… your mother told you to do it. It affects… how much time you'll spend in prison. The weight of your crime. So did she? Did she tell you to do it? I did it on my own. My mom had no part in it. It was all me. Why won't you admit it? Come on… Shuhei… AKIKO: THREE YEARS OF PROBATION SHUHEI: 12 YEARS IN PRISON NEITHER OF THEM APPEALED THE RULINGS Enter. Sit. Fuyuka… How is she? We finally found a foster home for her. But I can't tell you where yet. I don't want her… to end up like me. You'll get to write to each other soon. I'm working on it. Can I ask you something? I watched the trials. Why did you take all the blame? Twelve years… It's so long. It's better here than the outside. Because here… I can eat regularly. I can read books. Is that why? May I go? Wait. There's more, isn't there? Shuhei! I… I love my mom. Even now? What should I have done? She's helpless on her own. But… you said you did it all by yourself. You shouldn't lie. Why not? Everything about my life… has been wrong anyway. But is it wrong to love my mother? I came to tell you about Fuyuka. They're my kids. Shuhei… Fuyuka… You're an incapable mother. Shuhei… He said he loves you. Even now.
