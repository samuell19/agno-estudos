Take him down there. Quickly! -Merry Christmas, Jeff. -And to you. -They're getting too clever with those cannon. -They've had enough practice. -Really brandy, sir? -Christmas cheer. -Sweetness and light. -Lal. With the Sahib's permission, may I wish you the most merry season and a splendid New Year. -Thank you. -Same to you. And may the gods repay you, Hari Lal, with many sons. Thank you, sahib. -How are your men? -Dog-weary. They haven't slept since the siege began. Claybourne, they are soldiers. They'll do what they're told. My men are tired and sick, those that left. I sent for you because I intend to use them in an assault. Peace on Earth. The end of our campaign to all events. With any sort of luck, we should be able to finish off these marauders. Sir, will my company be in on it? They will, Ronald. -Then here's to a good fight. -TO an easy one. How did this beverage get out here? A gift from Vivian. She asked me to open it on Christmas Day and think of her. Let's drink to your daughter with all our thoughts and love. -Thank you. -To Vivian. May we see her soon. -The guns are in position. -Good. -Merry Christmas. -Same to you. -Who's drinking the brandy? -lam. The job of the Colonel's aids is to aid the Colonel. -Help yourself. -Thank you, sir. -Any casualties? -Three. Rotten job bringing up those guns at night. Gentlemen, come over here, please. There is the entrance to Malakai Pass. It has taken us a month to get Siri Math and his tribe bottled up in there. They've shot us to pieces, but they've made their last raid on British India. As McLeod told you, I brought up a pair of cannon to point-blank range. Very soon now they'll shatter his defenses. When that happens, you'll lead the assault into the pass with Number 1 Company. Yes, Sir. Blaine, when Claybourne's troops are inside, you'll follow with Number 2 Company. Yes, Sir. If all goes well, I'll then commit the remainder of the troops. Yes, Sir. Will the bugler sound the advance for me? No. You'll move when the barricade is down. -Yes, Sir. -Blaine, use your own judgment when to follow in support. -vVery good. -McLeod, the bugler will sound the order for the guns to open fire. Yes, Sir. Well, not much of a Christmas present, I'm afraid. My respect to your men and good luck. Thank you, sir. -Won the price again? -Have I? Don't press your modesty, Jeff. You're pleased old Morrow picked your company to lead the attack. It's a company of fine soldiers, the compliment belongs to them. If it's a compliment to be the first to get shot at. -You'll get your taste of it. -After you. Rather a habit of mine. You don't have the idea that we're two white knights jousting for Vivian's fair hand, do you? Of course not, you're the black knight. -Captain, sahib! -Yes? It would be better to throw stones. This dog of a rifle fights on the side of the enemy. Like an old dog it's worn and crooked, but it's tooth is strong. Today it will bite. Havildar Major Puran Singh! Give me number one platoon in the center, number two on the left and number three on the right. It has already been arranged, sahib. I heard there will be an attack. Did you also hear you might have waited for my orders? The sahib thoughts are my orders. Come on. -How is it? -It's well that we fight together. We'll give the enemy a lesson in the use of bayonet. Teach it well. Those beggars have found the range. -It's time for our guns to open up. -Yes. And I can't wait to see those gates go. Ronnie! -Captain sahib! -0ver here! Colonel Morrow's compliments. Major McLeod is dead. You are to be the Colonel's new aide. Report to him. Very good. Havildar Major, you will take over and lead the attack. -Is that clear? -Don't be angry. It's good for a man's honor to be the aide to the Colonel. It's good for a man's stomach to be with his soldiers! Number1 Company! Fix bayonets! -I'm sorry about McLeod. -You'll take his place. Was it necessary that I be removed at this moment? I consider that it was! Have a look. It will only be a few seconds now. Forward!! -It's a trap. -They were waiting for us to break through! Why Blaine doesn't attack? -He was to follow my company! -He was to use his own judgment. But we can't leave them out there! We'll save what we can. Sound the retreat! But a retreat won't help them! You heard my order. Blaine! -Why didn't you attack? -It's too late, they've done for! I won't go out there for a handful of men! What can 1 do? Blaine! What's the matter with you? Bugler! sound the attack! Gentlemen, the part played by Captain Jeffrey Steven Claybourne, First Company, Ninth Bengal Rifles, in the siege and capture of Malakai Pass was described yesterday. The court-martial will resume. Judge Advocate, continue the examination of the witness. Havildar Ram Singh, the regimental bugler told us Captain Claybourne gave you the order to sound the advance. Yes, Major sahib. His heart was sick for his soldiers. Just answer my questions. You believed the order to advance came from Colonel Morrow? -Yes, sahib. -Thank you. Examination completed. Does the accused with to cross-examine? No, sir. That will be all. Thank you. Next witness. Captain Blaine, please. Captain Blaine sahib is called. Sir. -l asked you not to come here today. -I'm sorry, father. -Did you expect me to stay away? -l suppose not. I know it means a great deal to you. So does it to me. -Good morning. -Miss Morrow. I had hoped to spare you an unpleasant situation. -Will they decide today? -I expect so. Vivian... The court will give him every chance they can. Jeff did something that might have been disastrous. He must never do it again. God willing, he will go on with his career. Captain Blaine, basing your answer upon your knowledge of the accused, would you say that he was sufficiently in command of his faculties to be aware of his actions at the time? I informed Captain Claybourne that support in company strength would have been a useless waste of lives. Since he undertook to argue with me, I assume he was aware of his intentions. He was under strain, which every officer must appreciate. You said you remonstrated with the accused. What then occurred? He struck me. That will be all, Captain Blaine. Thank you. Why didn't you tell me? We'll have to cross-examine! Does the accused wish to question the witness? You can't let it go by! I am sure Captain Blaine well remembers his experiences at Malakai Pass. -I have no questions to ask him. -Thank you, Captain Blaine. -Next witness. -Call Colonel Morrow. During the years that Claybourne has served with me, he has been a gallant and efficient officer. Up to the time that he deliberately reversed your orders? -Yes. -Thank you, Colonel Morrow. Does the accused desire to question the witness? With the court's permission. Colonel Morrow, have you considered that the accused might have misinterpreted your orders? -It is possible, sir. -No, sir. That was not the case. To protect my men from annihilation I disobeyed an order. To this I plead guilty! Were I to face a similar choice tomorrow, my decision would be the same! Jeff! If Captain Claybourne has completed his remarks, this court will consider its verdict. This court, upon due consideration of the whole matter before them, is of the opinion that Captain Claybourne is guilty of disobeying the order of his commanding officer, whom he was by instruction directed to obey according to the rules of war. In consideration of his former record, it's the opinion of this court that punishment be limited to a severe reprimand to be read before the officer's assembled regiment; and further, that Captain Claybourne to be relieved of his command and of all duties until further notice. Captain Claybourne, is there anything you wish to say? I thank the court for its leniency, but since both the service and my countrymen reject my standards of conduct, I have no choice but to resign my commission! It will be our recommendation that your resignation be accepted. This court is dismissed. I've been waiting. They told me. No sympathy from you. Can't you tell the difference between sympathy and...? I'm proud of you! If you'd have backed down... Do you realize what it means? I do, Mr Claybourne. Darling, the world hasn't come to an end. It hasn't, not for us! You see things very clearly. I don't... Not now. We have so much to talk about. Let's talk tonight. Where? Would you suggest the reception at your father's house? I only have to be there for an hour. Then I'll meet you any place. A secret rendezvous? It's no good. Jeff, I'm not ashamed of you. We can't plan our lives in public. I know the place to meet: The Jewel of the Lotus. Of all places... You know that's impossible. All 1 know is what you've told me about it. And I'll never see it unless it is with you. -It just isn't done! -The more reason why it should be done! Tonight I'd just love to break some of their silly, smug rules. Company! 'Ten-shun! Number 1, forward march! Eyes, right! -Good evening. -Good evening. -Father? -Thank you. Your punch is delightful. The guest of honor seems to have been detained. The Rajah's rank entitles him to be 30 minutes late. He'll take 45. Our little arrangement is going to be more important than we thought. Jeff's resignation has put us all in a bad light. The bazaars are full of gossip. All the more reason for making our point with Rajah. The Rajah's party is coming through the gates. Thank you. Darling, it's not as late as we thought. -May 1? -I'd rather not if you don't mind. Of course. Too bad about Jeff. -He did what he believed in. -l suppose he did. I know how you feel about him. I'm afraid this takes you farther away from me. Why? -I testified against him. -His Highness, the Rajah Karam Jeet. Welcome to my house. -It was kind of you to ask me. -You know my daughter Vivian. -Certainly. We must thank the British for blessing us with such beauty. -Your Highness is most kind. -May I present Sir Hugh Boswell. His Highness, Rajah Karam Jeet. Your Highness. -Colonel Rivers. -Your Highness. -Major Jennings. -Rajah sahib. Captain Blaine. Blaine? Yes. Were you one of those who fought against Siri Chandra Nath at Malakai? I had the honor to be there. There was another officer, Captain... Claybourne. A friend of yours, Miss Morrow. I hope you will permit me to express my admiration for him. What a pity that his qualities of leadership must now go to waste. Perhaps he will console himself with the knowledge he is free to see my country as it is and not as my friends, the British, wish it to be. Your friends' wishes are for continued peace. Your Highness? -A splendid party. -Thank you. It always seemed to me ironical that here in Indial should be the guest and you the host. Indeed? We have another guest that may surprise you. Excellent! I delight in the unexpected. -Will you forgive us? -Certainly. Gentlemen? This way, Your Highness. Will you step into the study? Yes, the latest Enfield. With the new rifling in the barrel. Great accuracy and penetration up to 800 yards. An excellent weapon, Colonel. We hope we shall never need to use it. Why does the army always pretend to loathe its job? unless it is because an army that fulfills itself, also destroys itself. As in the case of the late Siri Chandra Nath? He was destroyed by his own stupidity. He sought to subdue the lion by fighting him. If you desired to subdue the lion, how would you set about it? Simply by having his claws cut off. Always providing that you had caught him first. The new cartridge is most interesting. In loading it, one must bite the paper from the end. Your Highness is well informed. It is most heavily greased. The British Lion will destroy its enemies so long as it possesses such a weapon. -Welcome, Memsahib. -Thank you. Come with me, please. Claybourne sahib is in there. Vivian. I didn't know if you'd come. I told myself it would be better if you didn't. Why? Because I had all evening to think about the future and us. I was trying to be logical. It worked beautifully until you came. I didn't know anybody could be so lovely! Thank you, darling. IS he a warrior? Do you think she's in love with him? How does he feel about her? -Everything is so perfect. -Vivian. And it will be for a lifetime. We'll share all the beauty that ever was. Everything starts from now, from this moment. After we're married, we'll remember how this is and... What is it, Jeff? -l can't marry you. -Why not, darling? Why not? For a moment I forgot what I am. I can't ask you to share my life. I've nothing to give you. Nothing but your love. Yes, my love, always. -The love of failure. -Jeff! How we'd live? It won't be easy, but my eyes are open. I love you and nothing else matters. The decision to leave the service was mine and so are the consequences. I can't ask you to share them. Not now or ever. I'm sorry. Then you don't want me? I'll never stop wanting you. I'd better take you home. No. The carriage is outside. I said everything started from tonight on. Everything new from now on. Goodbye, my darling. -You leave early, Claybourne. -It's been a long day. Two English officers have arrived. If you would rather not see them, leave this way. Through there you will find a door. Sahib, at Malakai Pass you have done a great thing for my people. It is not well that you are repaid with unhappiness. Such things are not done for payment. I'm sorry, sahib. Forgive me, Latah, if I forget the words of friendship. Tell me your thoughts. There's a blackness in your heart because you've broken with your people. You speak as a kind friend, but what's done is done. Go, then. If you have need of me, I'll serve you as you have served my people. Guard your life, sahib. For you value it lightly and your thoughts are filled with destruction. Sahib, how many times have we hunted together? Without number. A man is no good for hunting when life has no meaning. When he hunts the tiger his heart must be full or he will die in the tiger's jaws. Stay here. The Englishman has the mark of death on him. Shoot! Did the sahib wish to throw his life away? Give the tiger to the villagers. We'll camp here tonight. You should choose your men carefully, Mahindra. This is Hardey, he is from my own village. What harm have I done you? I am ashamed. Many times this jackal has shared my bread. -I will make him speak! -I will repay your bread. Free my arms and I will give you a piece of chapati. It has come a long way. You must taste it for yourself. Free him. From the east, the south, the north, the west... I bring you bread. What game is this? Does this frighten you? Bind him! You see, Englishman? They are wise to be afraid. Have you such wisdom? We have served you well. Let him go! All right, go back to sleep. Mahindra, sit with me. Each day we eat a chapati such as this. Why is it different? -In his hands it is evil. -Why? He is a messenger. -Forgive me, had I only... -What message does this carry? There are many like him... They go through all India and carry the chapati as their mark. lam not a wise man. I know that the messengers say one day a river of blood will sweep our land. English blood. Why do they plan our death? They say the English wish to steal our souls. Where did you get...? No more, or when the day comes, I, too, shall die. Thank you, Mahindra. Get some sleep. Tomorrow we go back to Diwanpur. -Greetings, Claybourne sahib. -Health and honor. His Highness, Rajah Karam Jeet, has chosen me to be his voice. He welcomes you once again to Diwanpur and asks that you may be his guest at the palace. Would you also be my voice? Tell His Highness I will share his roof when there is friendship between us. -Claybourne sahib. -Does it go well with you? I am grateful that you seek me out. Many prayers have been offered for you. -May we speak? -Come. You have been long on the road. Drink and rest. How may I serve you? -By speaking the truth. -It shall be. What does this chapati mean? Once a wise man made a prophecy. He said the English rule would last but 100 years. This year makes the 100th since your people came to India. -And this? -It marks the prophecy. Those who bring the chapati say that many will die. -When? -This is not known. -I can't believe this. -Yes, sahib. With my own eyes I have seen a strange thing happening. Each day for 3 days a beggar came to the fountain in the market place. You will see for yourself. Come, sahib. Company, left wheel! Halt! Company, left face! Break off! Havildar Jee, I am thirsty. Lend me your cup. Let an unspeakable like you defile me? Out of my sight! Fool! You are defiled already! All of you who bite the British bullet! Tell me, soldier. What is the holiest of living things? -The sacred cow. -The cow, which you are forbidden to eat. Give me a bullet. Yet the British grease your bullets with cow's fat. Like slaves you bite the bullet to load the new guns and the grease is on your teeth and in your stomach, so that you'll be born again as slugs and snails! Get out of here! Go on! You have eaten a curse. Who told you this nonsense? The sahib is angered by the truth. Claybourne sahib. It is good to see an old friend. You have always been with us in danger. You know what this means to us. Is it really so? Do they grease the bullet with cow's fat? I don't know. But I say this as your brother: the British have no plans to steal your souls. Rest on it that I will speak for you. Yes, I know about the cartridges. And your troops are learning fast. Whatever your motives, I suppose I owe you my thanks. -You're welcome. -However, you're mistaken. These cartridges are not greased with beef fat. The sepoys think so. The first cartridges that were issued for the new rifles were greased with a concoction of beef and pork fat. As the Hindus consider themselves damned if they eat beef, and the Moslems are no better off if they eat pork, with one master stroke of stupidity we very nearly succeeded in alienating the entire Indian army. That's right, sir. However, those cartridges were withdrawn. These are greased with a mixture of beeswax and oil. Why haven't you told that to them? I have no intention of discussing ordnance policy with the sepoys. This is no longer of any consequence. Thank you. I disagree with you. Your troops are frightened and upset. Jeff, I'd like to propose a toast. Let's drink to the day you once more become the man we knew. You won't drink to that? The man you knew didn't meet your standards. I refuse to take responsibility for your present state. Please don't. If you won't tell the men about the bullets, then at least protect them from their own fears. Recall those cartridges, whatever they're greased with. Issue new ones and let the men grease them themselves. It'd take at least two months to get a new supply of cartridges from the arsenal at Dum Dum. I'm not going to disarm my command with Rajah Karam Jeet waiting for the least sign of weakness. -It's your command. -Precisely. And I'm quite prepared and able to direct it without civilian advice. The day may come when you'll welcome it. Latah! I followed the beggar. He entered the gates of the Rajah's palace. I see... I think I will accept that invitation from His Highness. Thank you. Your Highness, Claybourne sahib is here. Why did you invite me here? A wish to welcome a brave men within my house. There are many brave man among our soldiers. But none such as yourself, whose heart is joined to the people of India. For them you sacrificed your career. I wish to offer you a new one, Captain. I know only one trade. And I have need of one such as you, skilled in war, with a hunger to fight. I want you to train my troops and be my general. The general of an army that threatens my own people? Captain Claybourne, Who are your people? Colonel Morrow, who dishonored you? Captain Blaine, who lied to destroy you? Are these your friends? Or are your friends my people? Join us, Captain. What shall I be paid for this? You shall have place and honor. And, each month, one thousand English pounds. Think it over. A general is as good as his weapons. The most beautiful steel from Damascus is not enough? Not for my command. Is an arsenal full of these enough? The new rifle? They arrived within a fortnight of the shipment to the British garrison. Ammunition? With this bullet, the British rule in India will be smashed. The Enfield cartridge? Yes, smeared with beeswax and oil. My soldiers know this, but the sepoys are convinced they're greased with cow's fat, a conviction I have done nothing to destroy. How much time will I have to train your troops? There are 128 British garrisons in India. In one of these, the sepoys have been ordered to rise up and kill their officers. Their success will be the signal for a general rebellion. And where will the mutiny start? You will have this information after you have accepted my offer. I see. Perhaps I could have your decision by tomorrow night? Meantime, I would be most happy to have you share my roof with me. Your Highness is most generous. If you will follow my servant, you will find your quarters prepared. Thank you. This morning the Englishman spoke of you with poison in his mouth. -He suits me well. -l would hesitate to give him any trust. Trust? I give him no trust. Not yet. He will not be permitted to leave the palace. First, we will arrange a test for tomorrow evening. His Highness is looking forward to the pleasure of your company. May I present my friend, Captain Claybourne? I believe you know our guests. -I do. -Of course. -I'm glad to see you looking do well. -Thank you, Colonel. I had dared to hope that this reunion of old friends would please you. I see we're ready to be served. Shall we? Miss Morrow. Colonel Morrow. Captain Claybourne. Captain Blaine. Gentlemen. You're quite a surprise. I had no idea that you and the Rajah were such personal friends. We find we have a great deal in common. I'm sorry about being thrust upon you like this. It doesn't matter, really. With your permission I should like to propose a toast. I drink to the end of a hundred years of English rule in India. With your permission, Rajah sahib, I give you the second hundred years, may they increase the harmony between us. There is still another reason for this celebration. I'm about to embark on what I hope will be a more effective policy in guiding our relations with our British friends. We will be delighted to hear it. I believe it has been said that to prepare for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. Accordingly, I plan to strengthen my personal army. How interesting... In what way, Your Highness? I intend to install a hew military commander. I've asked Captain Claybourne to be general of my army. The Captain first came to my attention by his devotion to the people of India. A devotion, which he maintained even though it meant giving up his own people. Should such a man join me, some might even use the word "treason". What is your answer, Captain Claybourne? The pay is right. I accept I won't share this table with a traitor. You see, Captain Claybourne? You have a great talent for the double game. Yesterday you played it beautifully, the complete patriot, full of concern for his countrymen and the troops. When you came to me about the cartridges I disagreed with your ideas. But I believed that your only motive was to prevent trouble with the sepoys. You have chosen a clever spy, Rajah Karam Jeet. We thank Your Highness for his hospitality. Come, Vivian. Gentlemen. You neglected to inform me of your visit to the Colonel. Perhaps you'd care to do so now? What is it you'd like to know? Tell me of your efforts to help the English. What a pity that the Colonel uncovered your masquerade! You almost deceived me! I truly believed you capable of joining us! But like some slave, you grovel at the boots of your British masters! Yes, indeed, you have talent for treason! Only it is India you betray! Your Highness speaks as a great patriot! But your love for India is like a thief's love for his victim. Not here! Latah... How long have I been like this? A few days. This is my village. We found you unconscious. You were carried here on a litter. -l must travel. -You are without strength. -The mutiny has to be stopped! -You can't change destiny. Outside this place there's a great evil. Men speak of hatred and sharpen their knives. My village know nothing of these things. Stay with us, sahib. I'll make you well. And perhaps your life will find a new sweetness. I am blessed with a great friend, Latah. Your thoughts are far away. I can remain only until I'm strong again. Then rest well. Perhaps you've discovered a great truth. A man belongs to those with whom he has eaten his first salt. You'll return to your own people. Attend my words! Have no fear. I bring you only the magnificence of freedom. Come close. Today marks the hundredth year of the rule of British and tonight it will end forever! Tonight is the Night of the Long Knives! Already our glorious brothers in Meerut have crushed the Englishman. Before the dawn breaks tomorrow the rivers will run red with blood. English blood! Are there any Englishmen in the village? Yes! There is one. He rests inside. -The Englishman is not here. -Search the village! Vivian! She's not here. Don't be fool. Do you think I'd be here now if I were working with the Rajah? Put it down, Ronald. We're fighting the same now as long as we're alive. -The Colonel! Vivian! -Both gone! Maybe dead. I don't know. -Where were you? -Trouble in the hills. Just got back with the patrol. Let us go from this accursed place. Let all the English die. Have I served you so badly that each man now becomes his own leader? All of you, hear me! death to the English soldiers! -How could we let this happen to us? - We must help free India... -Death to the English soldiers! -You never thought it was possible, did you? All our sepoys, all those we trained. -Murderers! -What about your men? Why should they be any different than the others? Sahib, you must flee from this place. In all India no English will survive the killing. -Your arm... -I have tasted many bullets. Do as I say, my brother. Lal! The gods are good to send you to me. -The Colonel and Miss Morrow are safe. -Where? You know Colonel Morrow's place of hunting? -Yes. -There they hide. They have sent me for help. You must go to them. And you? I shall learn what I can among the soldiers. Colonel Morrow! Colonel Morrow! Colonel Morrow! Vivian! Colonel Morrow! It's Blaine. Come ahead! Here! -Vivian all right, sir? -She's in the shooting pit. Jeff! Could you use another soldier, sir? -Thank you for coming to us! -Thanks. We hope to strike out for Calcutta, if that's possible. We'll know when Hari Lal returns. What are our chances, Jeff? The whole country will be swarming with rebels. We'll just have to see in the morning. Meanwhile, you'd better get some rest. I'll take the first watch. Colonel! Listen! All around us! I'm sorry, my darling. SO very sorry. It would take a lifetime to make up for everything that went wrong. Colonel Morrow! It's Hari Lal. Hari Lal! This way! Yes, Colonel! I bring much help! -Lal! -Yes. But now you must address me as Captain. Why... you! You will forgive me my little deceit, but my orders from the Rajah were to take you alive! So drop your arms! All of you! You too, Mr Claybourne. How fortunate I was to arrange to have you all here together! Thank you for your great loyalty, Lal. My loyalty is to India. I served her best by pretending to serve you. Which of these English monkeys shot you? It was he. Once I thought you loved my country. But now you join the other English. Then die with them. Come. The Rajah is most anxious. Fire! Fire! Find the Englishman or you will answer to the Rajah! I'll bring him back. Move on! Hari Lal has hunted well. In that case, our task here will soon be finished. And then we leave to join our troops at Lucknow. -Where is Claybourne? -There was much fog... Where is Claybourne? My men were not watchful. You will punish them for their stupidity. -You allowed him to escape. -He fled into the swamp. Puran Singh searches for him. Perhaps he is already dead. I ordered you to bring him alive. Your Highness, I've served India with my life. You portray India's new freedom most graphically. From the death of this thing my people will learn obedience. From you, Colonel; Captain Blaine, they will learn that victory is sweet but ruthless. It gives me great pleasure that you should die at the hands of your own troops. Take them away. -Father. -Miss Morrow. Are you not going to plead for your father's life? How proud you are. But pride, like life itself, can be easily wiped out. After the execution of your father, you will be taken to the palace. My guests will enjoy the novelty of being served by the daughter of the great British Colonel. Squad, halt! Left! -I swore the Englishman would not cheat us of his life. -Your arrival is most fortunate. I'm sure your death will afford an even more excellent spectacle. Take him to the wall. -Your Highness, have I not earned a favor? -Ask it. Since it was my hand that captured Claybourne, let it be my command that sends him to his death. So be it. I remember the battle at Malakai Pass, I remember the soldiers who were trapped there and the British officer who risked his life to save them. When you hear the command to fire, each of you must decide how this debt must be paid. Squad! Ready! Present! Fire! Shoot! Shoot! Prepare to receive cavalry. Cut them down! Vivian! I lied at Jeff's court-martial because I wanted you. I was too ambitious. -Vivian. -Yes? Jeff, your men hope that you'll be leading them again soon as their captain. -It's my wish also. -And mine. With any sort of luck we ought to be able to join a column which is moving north form Calcutta. Anyhow, we'll march to meet them. Sahib. Today the men fought for you, but in their hearts there is still a dream of freedom for India. when will we have that freedom? I don't know, Puran Singh. But one day you'll have it. In a time when all Indians will be brothers and so will the British. Just as you and I are brothers. I must return to my village. All our good wishes go with you. We'll never be able to repay you, Letah. You must repay the gods. It is they who command your happiness. We'll repay the gods, Jeff. That we will.
