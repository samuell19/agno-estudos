This is Art. You Art, it's Tee. Oh hey man, how's it going? You know can't complain. Listen my boss asked me if I knew anybody with some experience that could come help out in the shop today. The silkscreen shop? Yeah yeah yeah look man, this bitch Juliette didn't come in today and we could really use a hand. I know you're an artist and you got a little bit of shop experience. Cool I'm down. We talking like right now? No time like the present Bro Chacho. Cool I'll be there in 30 brother, and hey thanks man. Art dude, glad you could make it. I'm gonna stomp the shit out of him. Hey man. Great to see you, it's been a minute. Cool shop. Yeah, it's just a little crazy around here in case you haven't noticed. It's all good. So what are you gonna have me doing? Pulling shirts, catching shirts, printing shirts, you know shirts. I think I can handle that. Well let me introduce you to everybody, come on. This here is poncho, he is the best in the biz. Hey Ponch, this is Art, he's going to be helping us today. He's been screen printing for a while. Nice to meet you. You don't know. Don't worry about him, he says that all the time. This is Henly, he just started but he's an aspiring printer. How are you? I'm good man. I'd like to get your opinion on something. What do you think? That's really something. Yeah I'm working on my own T-shirt line. This is gonna change everything, bears are really in right now. Especially bears this big old dolphin dicks. Keep up the good work. I think you're really onto something there. I know. Alright this is Mark and Reggie, they own the shop. Reggie's cool but Marks a little bit of tally whacker. Got it. Yo Mark, Reg this is the dude I was telling you about. What's happening guys? Thanks for letting me help out. Well it's good to have you aboard Art. So Tee tells me you're an artist and a photographer? Yeah, that's right. You look you'd be good at cleaning screens. Why don't you have Tee here show you around, we'll get the details later. Shit's crazy right now, all of my major printers came in at once and I'm literally about to choke somebody. Oh I gotcha man, well look forward to... Mark, what about today? Lace I told you we can't do it today. Juliette didn't show up. Keep on of these on you, it's a USB drive, also a laser pointer. Y'all print these too? No just a promo item, come on. Let me give you the 10 cent tour man. This is the press I always use. Poncho is always on that one. Back there we've got the darkroom and the washout area. The shiters back in that corner, and the dog's name is Silkie. So what's the deal with all these people? They all run local T-shirt companies? Yeah they're all scrambling right now because this new line of shirts called Elegant Decay just hit. It's affecting everybody's business. You won't believe how competitive these people are. Yeah that guy's totally giving that lady the stink eye. That's Hanes, he runs Crescent City Clothings. He sells the most stuff in here and he's still worried that everybody else is such a threat. Funny thing is the lady he's stink balling now really looks up to him. The lady in the Below Sea Level shirt? Yeah that's Lace. And what's funnier than that is see her. Melting Plot? That's Bella, Lace's longtime rival. Let's just say they've had a colorful past. They used to mess around? I could see that. Wait till you see Bella's daughter Cammi, she will get your dick pregnant dude. Who's getting pregnant? You are, if I've got anything do with it. Hi I'm Heather. Art. This knucklehead's your friend? Think you would have more sense than that. Keep joking beautiful. Heather's new here but she'll do fine as long as she does what I say. See what I have to deal with? I'm just joking doll face. She drives me insane dude. Hi Polly, how's my little Olive Loaf? Oh hey T, I hate it when you call me that. Olive Loaf? Polly's nice, dumb but nice. I mean she's not cutthroat like all these other cretins in here. What's her company called? All Dat Jazz, dumb. All these people are exploiting our fine city with their gaudy bullshit, one day there's gonna be a reckoning. Put my fucking hands on him, I'm gonna hurt him. What's his story? Oh that's Tank he does all the Ninth Ward Soldier stuff. Just stay on his good side, that's all I'm saying. I had no idea this business was so ruthless. Hey Marcus you think I got time to hang out with these low rent ripoff artists? Starting to draw flies here. What we looking at today Sax? Dead girl, she had this axe buried in her chest and throat slit for good measure. Who's the girl? No idea, no ID. She had money on her when we found her, but no wallet and no identification. How long she been laying down here like this? I had to guess I'd say this happened around three, maybe 4:00 a.m. Whoever hit her with the axe is highly skilled, did so from maybe 15 feet away. She was a pretty girl. Does look like the neck wound was tampered with after the initial slice though. No tracks so far that we found. Somebody was real careful. This is not a normal killing Sax. Drive bys, gang retaliations, this is not that. This, this was personal. I just made more coffee. You still drinking coffee? I'm just getting my fix Heather, beats crack right? Are you staring at my ass? Jesus. He gorgeous. Thinking about asking Art out for some beers later, you want to join? You know welcome him to the family? I don't know, text me later maybe I'll come meet you. Sweet. Tee are you seriously checking out my boobs? Huh? Are you fucking kidding me? Hey Sean can I get a couple IPAs? You're cool Tee, but I need to see his ID. Juliette Shields, 26. Originally from Lafayette, Louisiana. She got picked up twice for shoplifting organic produce. Sounds like a hardened criminal. Right? Current address? Nope, just the one on file in Lafayette. So unless she's commuting to the city every morning we don't have an address. That's a hell of a commute peddling that cruiser she was riding last night. Any prints on that axe handle? Partials, either he tried to wipe it off afterwards or he's got scarred hands. Or he wore rubber gloves. If he wore rubber gloves there wouldn't have been a print. Disposables can leave an impression. So we have no address, we have no name. But we do have a place of employment. This is my friend, is what we call a lead. Well Polly as it is we stayed late to finish this order. I mean I'd love to have all of them done for you but it's been 12 hours today we're really exhausted. You can pick him up tonight if you like Lace. Mark and I were about to start closing up, but we'll be here for a bit and we have some of your order right now. Alright well I'll tell you what Polly just we'll stay late for you, yeah come pick them up tonight absolutely. Yeah anything for you. Alrighty then, no problem bye. Okay great, eight o'clock it is. Thank you Lace, bye. God these women are so pushy. Do this, do that, I need them tonight, blah blah blah. So fucking stupid. I know man. Lace really gets my fucking blood boiling when she talks to me like I'm a little kid. Reg one day we're gonna have to show them that we're running the show. Yeah. Show them that we don't take shit from nobody. It's just like these fucking menopause twats treat us like kindergartners, we run this fucking business man. Right, and meanwhile we have dicks and they don't. Exactly. You see what I mean? And they're so stupid too. I'm gonna print a towel that says gumbo on it. Fucking stupid. Wait, I have something to show you. Check this out man. Wow, where'd you get that? Tank hooked it up, it's brand fucking new. Dude let me check it out. Dude you look tough with that gun. I feel tough. What's that Polly? You need the gumbo towels today? Fuck no. Dude, Polly's on her way over here. You want to do something? Man it's great to be back in a real shop. Well it's kind of like slow death. But it keeps the buds in the bowl I guess. I'm just doing it to my gyno graffiti takes off. Or maybe I was meant to work with cancer causing chemicals and slave away in a sweatshop for the rest of my life. So tell me about Mark and Reggie. Are they pretty cool to work for? That's hard to say. Sometimes I don't think they're playing with a full deck. Really. Well I'm pretty sure Mark's having an affair with Silkie. The dog? And he has problems with his libido. And as for Reggie, he's got this thing for older women but he's scared of experience. How do you know so much about their personal lives? I have my ways, trust me. Reggie likes cougars but is afraid of experience, weird. Yeah you won't catch me groping no wrinkled beef curtain that's for sure. I'm saving my nectar for Heather. You really dig her? I'm anxious to see Bella's daughter. Dude you will not be disappointed. She does all the modeling for Melting Plot. And man spank bank material. Yeah I'd really like to... Fuck her. Yeah dude, fuck them all. That's what I'm talking about man. Get pumped. Alright remember what we discussed. When I give the cue you pull the gun. Polly, come on in. Hey guys. Thanks for staying late to get these done for me. So you think you're gonna have the rest of them done by tomorrow? No Polly, I don't think that's gonna work. Oh really, I know you guys are so busy. So maybe by this weekend? Really don't think we can do that. Well okay, so when can I expect them by? Well maybe we'll print them. Or maybe we'll shove up your goddamn asshole. Oh, no no no no no. Here take a seat. What are you doing Marcus? Why are y'all doing this? Because we have had it up to here with you cunts. You want your towels printed tomorrow? Too bad fuck face. What did I do? So stupid, oh I'm gonna print towels that say gumbo on them, fucking stupid. Marcus I sell thousands of those a week, they're a hit. Everybody is so fucking stupid. Oh she's tied pretty tight. This fuck face isn't going anywhere. You you feel better Polly? Let me go please, I didn't do anything. Yeah. We're gonna make you pay for such ignorance Polly. Stop is Marcus, you're hurting me. Oh you want to know pain? It tastes like doggie. Polly I think we made a mistake here, I am so sorry. Reggie and I wanted to play a little joke on you and I think we might have taken it a little too far. Joke? Yeah this has all been a misunderstanding and I apologize. Appreciate it if you could keep that between you and me. And we'll have the rest of your order done for tomorrow certainly. You're free to go. Okay? Dude what the fuck was that? What? I thought we were gonna. Oh you're jealous 'cause I get a kiss. Shit man what now? Well here give me this. Checking it out it's your turn. Isn't Lace coming over for eight o'clock? Yeah. You got to try it man, it's invigorating. Dude Polly's halfway to the fucking cops by now. No way, she wants it. It's just rude. Like I talk to Juliette every single day. So for her not to text me back is really out of character for her. Like if I pissed her off that's one thing. But I didn't, and she hasn't posted anything all day. She wouldn't just up and leave town. You think she got arrested? She smoked a lot of pot but they don't arrest you for that. Otherwise she doesn't drive so she couldn't have got pulled over for anything. Maybe she found a dude to party with. You know Juliette was working on her own line of shirts. Maybe you know she went with that full time and decided she didn't need the shop anymore. Well it's rude not to say anything. So did she get fired? Am I just a fill in for her? No even if she didn't get fired we still need you in the shop. Yeah Art you're family now, and Crescent City Clothing moves enough product to keep us busy for decades. Well I should be going. I'll walk you out. Yeah I got to go too bro, I got to hit the hay. Okay, then you can both see me out. ♪ Gonna make it right tonight ♪ ♪ Gonna party down tonight ♪ Man we are so fierce bro. Man I feel like Sly and the Family Stallone or something. Yeah me too, check this one out At least we know it's loaded now. Yeah we got this. ♪ I'm just an outlaw baby ♪ ♪ Six shooting gun crazy baby ♪ Come in Lace. I got to get these and get out of here. I can't believe you made me so late and you didn't even put him into dozens. Reggie I told you about this. Did you guys hear that loud bang? Shit it is so late. You know sometimes I think that I need to stand here and monitor everything you are doing or else you won't get anything done. You know Reggie you could really use some further training in how to run a business. Oh yeah but you could really use a stupid asshole. I bet. What did you say to me? Mr. Jerrod, is everything okay? Oh my God. We're through taking shit from you Twatzilla. You want to bust my balls? Well you ought to be licking them. You're making a big mistake Reggie. You know something like this could ruin your life. Don't you wanna have a family someday? You are obviously under some sort of extreme stress and... Shut up douche face. I'm in charge now, no more manipulative psychobabble old lady bullshit from you, enough. The next thing out of your mouth better be your tongue. Oh come on, really, really? Lace I am so sorry. Please let us just make this up to you. Sorry doesn't cut it chump. Now drop the gun. Lace, I am so sorry. You're lucky I don't cut you a little Vienna sausages off, you pathetic excuses for men. Looks like your libido lied behind the barrel. Because now you got shit. You're absolutely right Lace, were weak. Please let us make it up to you. Oh you're gonna make it up to me, I'll be in touch. Oh you're gonna make it up to me alright. That didn't go so well. Dude you have no backbone, what the hell was that? What? Didn't you see the way I handled things with Polly? You got to take charge man. Well yeah but... Yeah but she probably creamed your jeans. You dropped the gun. Oh don't blame this on me you dropped the fucking gun too. God damn it. What the hell? Is this how you normally greet people around here? Sir I am so sorry, I didn't know you were there. Are you okay? Boy you lucky I don't ring your scrawny neck. Can we help you sir? I'm Detective Theodore Watson, I'm investigating a young lady by the name of Juliette Shields. I've come to understand that she's employed at this establishment, is that correct? Yeah we know Juliette, she helps out here at the shop and does artwork for some of our larger clients. Have either of you seen her in the past 24 hours? No. No. I mean no, she didn't show up for work today in fact. Does she have any enemies that you know of? Any problems she's been dealing with lately? No, not that I'm aware of. May I please have her address? Do any of you know where she lives? I don't know if we can just hand that over. Are you pleading the fifth or some shit? I'm pretty sure it's the 15th. Yep, payroll was today. What? We do have her check though if you find her. Yeah definitely the 15th. The fifth amendment? Are you choosing to remain silent in my questioning? Can you please give me the address of Miss Shields? Thank you. So is she a suspect of some kind? I'm a homicide detective. Do I have to spell out to you what that means? So what you're saying is, she's dead. Did the killer leave a note or anything? A note? Yeah you know to take credit. No son, the killer didn't leave us a note. I'll be watching you. Dude I told you Polly would go to the cops. Oh bullshit this guy's just investigating like a missing persons report or some shit like that. Yeah now he thinks we're involved. What like we're gay, you wish. Yeah, oh that was perfect. Well, I'm gonna go whip us up some lattes. Don't you move. And don't do all that cocaine, some seriously pure stuff. The maid forgot my fucking chia seeds! Is someone there? Hey speak up or you're dead. I got enough firepower in this place to blow up the fucking Superdome. Don't you know I'm a T-shirt mega god? Hey guys. Yo Tee man, those brews had me farting like a hurricane last night, I think I blew a gasket. What are you listening to? Oh hey bro, these two have been acting weird as fuck all morning, so I'm listening in on their conversation. How. With these, I can hear them clear as day. Look I bugged them. I spy on everybody okay just seriously I'll explain later. They've been talking about kidnapping, and police, and all kind of shit this morning. They're probably talking about some movie. No man, they mentioned Juliette and Detective Watson. This shit is local ese. We should probably look busy, so they're not on to us. You really think they had something to do with Juliet's disappearance? I mean why would they kidnap Juliette? Well if you remember I was telling you about their problems. And when the gun went off a second time. And we really are a couple of horn dogs. Yeah we got to chill with that detective poking around. These guys are psychos for sure. Serious dude, it's getting too crazy. Tango and Cash. Yo. What's up fellas? Just chilling. How's it going Tank? Dreamy baby, diamonds and rust. Hey tank, we got to try to thing we got from you last night. Oh yeah? Brother it is clean. Y'all better keep it around y'all too. Why's that? Because she'd getting real out here. You know Hanes from Crescent City? He was choked out last night at his bungaloo on a bayou. What? What? Came down the grapevine this morning. Watson want to keep it a secret, but ain't no secrets around here Reggie. Yeah Watson he was here last night asking about Juliette. Man I'm telling you that pretty little white meat got sliced ear to ear like Jack the Ripper on some shit. Dude are you hearing this? Yeah, this is crazy. Well what are we gonna do aren't you scared? Fuck no scared, I'm celebrating. Don't you know with that motherfucker gone out of the way I could take over this bitch. Wham bam, thank you ma'am. What's this? That's 20 G's, now we're going platinum, make it happen. We will. Fucking right you will. Always a pleasure my milk toast brothers. Alright Tank. Make it happen. I'm taking over this bitch don't forget. Dude I never did like Hanes, fuck that dude. At first I thought you were nuts, but this is real shit. It's like Tank said, shit is getting real. But how'd you know though? I mean you totally called it. This has been brewing for a while. I can almost smell it, like a shark smelling blood in the ocean miles away. Mark, these are all no good. You're gonna have to print all new ones. I can't sell these. Well Bella what's wrong with them? Every single one of these are off a quarter of an inch to the left. This is unacceptable. With Elegant Decay out upping their game, I can't afford any misprints. Geez Bella these are tri-blends. This ain't gonna be cheap, how many we talking? There's this box, and my daughter's bring in another. Dude prepare for an erection. Mark, you're going to have to replace all of these. Wow Bella, that's over 600 bucks. You should have thought of that before you let Poncho print everything off quarter of an inch. You don't know. You should see the website. Every summer I wax my beef to the beach wear page. Come on save it. Sorry, sorry. You know you guys aren't being very discreet with your perverted staring. You don't have to be jealous Heather. You know you're my number one. She's an overdose. But it's pretty clear this guy back here was murdered. She could have killed him and then just came back here for too many celebratory snorts. What about the cryptic note though? Fuck you know what, the killer left a fucking note. Andre, can I get that note back? Thank you. This was just on top of the body. It's not like it fell out of his underwear or something. She didn't leave that note, but this is a clue. I want all information on everybody at that print shop. All of the receipts, everything you can get me. There's something fishy going on here. We're gonna sniff this shit out. So you like spy on everybody? Well, it's kind of my thing. You know don't tell nobody but I find other people's lives really interesting. So I watch them. And listen to them. Pretty clever huh? Who new bugging people could be so much fun? Really? Yeah and I pick it all up on this little scoot right here. I can hear them 1000 feet away, clear as day. So you like listen to Mark in the bathroom and shit? No man no, none of that, did you ever want to hear what people say when you're not around? Well I know. Whatever man, you think too much. Yeah, I get that a lot. Either way my spying here is gonna help us get to the bottom of this T-shirt warfare. You know I often thought that eliminating the competition is a way to make a business assure success. If you're right, this is T-shirt warfare, I admire the attackers strategy, I think there's more to come. And that motherfucker right there is our first suspect. Seriously. So Art, you do photography right? Oh yeah, quite a bit actually, why? Well Bella's talking about needing somebody ASAP to help her get a new line of shirts live tonight. Would you be interested in something like that? Sure, I can do that. She'll pay you. Sounds great Mark, thanks. Great, I'll let her know. Dude do you realize what just happened? What? He just asked you if you want to photograph Cammi half naked, and get paid for it, and you said yes. Oh choice, that's right you said she models all her mom's clothes, holy shit. ♪ I'm there ♪ ♪ I'm New Orleans ♪ ♪ I work and live on all new there ♪ ♪ But I don't know what it means ♪ ♪ I'm there ♪ ♪ I'm New Orleans ♪ ♪ The crusties and the hipsters ♪ ♪ And the not so fucking queens ♪ ♪ Get a brain you alcoholic morons ♪ So there you are. His first photo shoot for me and he winds up running late. I thought I was going to have to take the damn photos myself. Actually I'm right on time. It doesn't matter. Mark actually said you know what you're doing. Yeah, I've been taking photographs for quite a while now. Good 'cause if you do well, you could become a regular. The last photographer left here with a restraining order to accompany his pink slip. That's funny. Cammi is behind the curtain. She'll let you know what you need to do. I have to attend a meeting, then go to the market. You should be done by the time I get back. Just upload all the files to my email on the website. Yes ma'am, no problem. Oh and keep your hands to yourself. Hello? Yeah hey, it's Art from the print shop. Oh great, I'll be right out. Hey, I saw you at the shop today. Yeah, I saw you too. We didn't get to officially meet, I'm Art. I'm Cammi, nice to meet you. Thanks so much for doing this on short notice. We're really in a rush to get this line going. Yeah, no problem, it's my pleasure really. When I saw you today I was hoping I'd get to meet you. Yeah, why is that? I don't know I just thought we had a connection. Me too actually. Alright well, you ready to get started? Yeah, let's do it. ♪ Love was such an easy game ♪ ♪ Till you walked through the door ♪ ♪ You came and swept me off my feet ♪ ♪ And left me wanting more ♪ ♪ And in my dreams I must admit ♪ ♪ You're always acting like ♪ ♪ But something hard in the back of my mind ♪ ♪ Cuts me like a knife ♪ ♪ Do you still love ♪ ♪ Do you want to love me in the night ♪ ♪ Do you still love ♪ ♪ Tell my you're gonna treat me right ♪ So did you get to fish in her canal or what? No, but we made a strong connection. She wants me to call her this weekend to make out, to hang out. Wow, man that is really awesome for you. She usually isn't very flirty. So what's all this stuff? Here we have all the local independent clothing companies along with the employees of our pals print shop. That's what I'm talking about, excellent let's hear it. Dude while you were playing herb rits with Cammi I have been busy. I made a sheet for every suspect in our circle. Geez, you have been busy. First is Henly. This guy seems like a prime suspect, relocated here from Rhode Island six months ago. He was Juliet's coworker. Three months ago he got picked up for soliciting, looks like a real asshole. The guy comes into town all of a sudden and then wants to make this T-shirt line with bear dicks. You really think he killed Juliette and Hanes? I wouldn't put it past him. Next up we have Mark and Reggie. These two bozos are right in the middle of everything. Plus there's a possibility we're dealing with more than one killer. The shit these guys we're talking about today was basically a confession. They're like two unabombers waiting to explode. Next up is Tank. Seems like a killer to me. Why 'cause he's black? No I just... Samuel Bartholomew Dangerfield, aka Tank. This guy's got a rap sheet a mile long, over a dozen murder charges all dismissed. Couldn't tell you how many times I've taken this hoodlum in. The moment something links him to this case I'm throwing the fucking book at his ass. Distributing, assault and battery, arson. Next up we have Poncho. Are you kidding, Poncho? The guy never says shit, it's eerie. He hardly speaks English, Poncho is harmless. We'll see about that. He was found naked inside of a crypt covered in his own urine. Next we got Lace and Bella. They used to work together years ago and then their relationship went sour and they ended up having an ugly separation. This clipping's from The Times, 1988. For years they were sharing a residency and a printing business until their court settlement in the early 90's. Both have charges for assault. Ugly separation? Yeah the two can't stand to be in the same room together. Really, look who just sat down. Something is off here dude. Wait a minute, I'm a suspect? Well technically, yeah. Well what about you? I would know if I was the killer. This guy also works at the shop. Tee, that's my boy, he alright. You know this dude? Yep, the CI from five years ago. Slacker, but a stand up guy. Our main focus should be on the print shop and those suspicious owners. Think I'm gonna pay them a visit tonight, see what stirring. Lace, I know you said you'd never forgive me but I was hoping that we could put old problems aside for now. What do you want? I can't even believe I'm sitting here with you right now. I think that someone's out to get us. What because of Hanes? Please, that guy was a scumbag. He probably had half the city gunning for him. He was a nagan supporter you know. This is serious, first Juliette now Hanes. I think someone's out to get one of us next. What are you doing? I've got a bug on Bella. Let's see what these old coots are talking about. Alright let's just say for a minute that someone is out to get us, why? Because our business is cutthroat, and now someone's taking that term literally. Poor Juliette was the sweetest girl that I've ever known. She was killed because of her position. I remember our old positions. Scissor Lips. Whoa. Dude Lace totally just changed the subject. You can say that again. Would you come stay with me at my home tonight? Protect me. I don't want to want to open that old wound again. Geez, keep it shut lady. No I think she means. Shit, you see how nervous I am? Ah shit, there goes the bug. Look I think we should follow Lace tonight. I think something juicy is gonna happen. If it'll make you feel better. Man, Lace is gonna run us into the ground for this, I can tell. Well maybe you should have let me handle her. Instead you're too busy playing bedtime baby nurses for nanny. Funny you say that, I did feel like a little baby when I was suckling on her booby. God damn it this fucking stupid thing. Why won't it fit? Man, look at all this cash dude. We could just skip town, pick up whores, and go to Vegas. Tank would find us for sure. My associate and I would like a bottle of your finest bubbly sir, and four hair pies please. Shit! Detective Watson I am so... Sorry, you gonna be sorry alright. What the hell are you cracker jacks doing in here? You better come clean with me too, spill it. This is actually for a large order sir. We were just playing around. Well I'm not. You just lost an employee, and your best customer, and you guys are in here playing around? You better pray no one else linked to this please dies or I won't hesitate lock your pansy asses up. Absolutely sir, this is a dark time for us here. I'd like to have a look at all invoices dealing with Crescent City Clothing. Not a problem sir. We're very cooperative by nature. Please. Just get the information together, drop it off at second district station. And this won't be the end of our acquaintance gentlemen. What a dick. Serious, what does he want us to solve the crime for him? Alright come on, bedroom's back here. Let's get out of here, she's no killer. Wait I want to see what she does. Dreams of Scissor Lips I'm sure. No way man, old ladies don't masturbate. Yeah, they do. You got to be kidding me. Let's get the fuck out of here. Fuck this. Why don't you just kill me already? Well now the first note makes sense. You got to be kidding me? What the fuck going on man? You blue suit wearing bologna pussy eating mother fuckers. You think I wasted this bitch? I ain't kill that which bitch. She ain't no threat. You ain't neither mother fucker, you ain't shit. Sit your ass down. Man let me go. Sit down. Oh great. Calm down brother, this white bitch was found dead on your property, so we got to take you in. What do you mean she was found, say bro... Anyway, she ain't white no more, she was skinned from head to toe. What that got to do with me? I don't think you did it. I think someone trying to set you up. You know I ain't do it. So just calm down and tell us what we want to know. I ain't saying shit till I get some representation. Have it your way. What are you king of burgers or some shit? What can you tell me about the screen print shop? Especially the pecker woods that run it. No it's no problem, don't worry about. It happens, thanks. Here you go man. Fucking piece of shit. My order gets fucked up everywhere I go. You know what fuck it. I'm not gonna let anything ruin this day. Hi mate, can you spare a fag? What'd you call me? I think she means a cigarette. Oh right, sorry here you go. Sweet mate. Nice shirt. Goddamn bums man. Do you think Elegant Decay is who's behind these murders? Maybe, nobody seems to know who's behind company. Yeah, and they're the newest kid on the block. And the oldest just got knocked off. Coincidence? And as a potential where next because we're the supplier for all the competitors. Doubt it. So the breakfast of champions, a roast beef and coffee? I saw Andre out front, said Tanks alibi checks out. He said that today, but I'll think of something to hold him anyway. Good to know he's off the street though. How do you eat so heavily so early? Yeah I'm headed to that shop, you wanna tag along? We just got off a graveyard. Why don't you just go home and get some sleep boss? Why you so hung up on these dicks at the print shop? So you saying they ain't got nothing to do with this? I'm not saying they have nothing to do it, I'm just saying isn't there a possibility they're just assholes? I mean why don't we just take a step back and look at this? This little piggy had roast beef. Sure do. It's the notes boss. Bella's coming back from the market right? And Hanes was killed in his home, just like the notes. So if this killers following this stupid rhyme then we have like three more murders to go boss. Then tonight's gonna be a bloodbath. We got to find this son of a bitch. There's something we're not catching here with the notes. Yeah, they're being printed at the shop. They could have worked there Sax. The notes have been silkscreened into the fabric. All we have to do is find the printer. So you want to full DNA test the notes? Yep, and in the meantime I'm gonna go old school. There at the shop and I'm on my way. This little piggy had none. Holy shit dude, shit is going down in there. What's happening man? That Detective is here talking to Mark and Reggie. He thinks they have something to do with the murders. And it sounds like somebody else got diced? What, who? I don't know, I just overheard them talking about a third victim. Hey it's Cammi, hold on a second. Hey Cammi, what's going on? I'm just about to head in to work. I didn't know who else to call. Oh no hey, I'm here for you, what's going on? My mom. No it's okay you can tell me. She's been murdered. The police woke me up first thing this morning. I don't know what's going on. I need to get out of here. Okay, I'll come pick you up. Just calm down, tell me where you are. I'm at the station on Broad. Thank you so much Art. I know we just but you really are sweet and... No it's no big deal, I'll be there soon. Bella's dead. What? Dude you got to jump on Cammi man. Chicks are always horny when they're upset. Seriously dude? Well they are I think. Alright can you cover for me here, I got to split. Yeah no problem. I mean they have their hands full in there. They probably won't even notice that you're gone. And Tee, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. I'm with you 100% from now on. Fucking right brohemian, it's coming down to it. And I know you're cool because I bugged you too. What? Yeah remember those little USB pens? Well I kind of remodeled them to host Bluetooth transmitters I just needed to know that you were on the level bro. Geez you're good. Now go take care of Cammi. I'll find out what information Watson knows. Sounds good, keep in touch. I'll tell you the big deal. I got bodies popping up left and right. And somehow it all point back to your shop. You're right you're totally right, I'm sorry. Now enough of this why you ask me bullshit. Absolutely bro, I mean sir, you have my full cooperation. I asked you nicely last night, and I would have been very pleased if I had got a certain stack of invoices pertaining to Crescent City Clothing delivered to my office this morning. But that just didn't happen. We are terribly sorry about that sir, and we can get those for you. Don't you need like a warrant or something man? Oh goddamn. Tee I don't know how you work for this asshole. Make like a twirling lawnmower bro. Man, that was pretty tough what you just did. Man these cops don't know me. What if he gets a warrant though? Geez man did you fart? It's like a fucking septic tank exploded. I don't know. Don't give me that shit, I know what your farts smell like. Oh, what is that smell? Smells like somebody opened a morgue sandwich. Clear the deck. Yo Ponch, you catch that whiff? Smells like a maggot Po boy in here. You don't know. Why do you always say that man? You think I don't know stuff? I know lots of things. I know lots of things. Who can it be, it's driving me crazy. My mom was going on about this new competitor in town. She was scared to be alone. She thought someone was out to get her. This Elegant Decay person or whatever? Yes. I have no idea what's going on. I just don't think I should be alone right now. We could go to my place. Thanks Art. I don't think I could go home. My mom and I really were two peas in a pod. I don't know what I'm gonna do now. Don't worry about the mess. Just come join me, hold me. Yeah sure. I just thought you might want to get some rest. Come here. I can't thank you enough for being here for me. You make me feel really safe. Anything you need Cammi, I really care about you. Yeah, that means a lot I really like you. I guess Tee really did know what he was talking about. Yes Mrs. Wang, so I'll send over the football wifebeaters ASAP. Right, I'll talk to you later. Polly hey, I was hoping to see you today. I'm sorry for popping in on you like this Marcus but I just really wanted to see you. Oh it's okay Polly, what's on your mind? Well I can't stop thinking about your behavior the other day. Oh I'm really sorry about that. No no, no I liked. I didn't know you were so tough. You know how it is. Perhaps we could get together later tonight? Yeah sure, okay. I want you to tie me up again and breathe your doggie breath all over me, like an animal. These mothers are sick. What that? Nothing, I was just listening to a really sic song. So Heather we've known each other a few weeks now right? Right. And you know how much I like you right? I guess so, sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's goofing off. Well I'm not goofing now. What if I told you I want to be with you tonight for your own protection? It's a good line but... What if I told you your life was in danger? Me, who would want to hurt me? Look you can't rationalize the actions of an insane person I think whoever's been killing people with ties to our shop is insane. You're being serious aren't you? Dead serious. Big easy prints. Hello there meat. Oh Lace, hey how's it going? It's gonna be going a lot better very shortly. Yeah why's that? 'Cause I finally figured out how you're gonna pay me back for your little stunt the other night. Stunt? Yeah meat, you're gonna be my slave tonight. I'm gonna show you just how tender you can be, like a flank steak, so juicy. You still there meat? Yeah sure Lace, that sounds like a plan. Be at my place tonight or I'll butterfly you. Okay Lace we can work with that. Thank you very much, bye bye. So Reg man I got to make like Rosie O'Donnell's inseam and split. Polly needs a little after hours assistance if you know what I mean. Can you lock up man? Actually I have an appointment with Lace tonight. Oh nice man. Take it easy man. Tee can you lock up, got to make that move. Well I kinda have a lot... Make sure nobody fucks with Tanks money. Poncha you guys stay late and finish the orders, later. Damn, everybody's getting lucky except me. So Heather, have you thought about what I was telling you earlier? Tee, I think you're sweet and I really appreciate the concern but I get the feeling that you're just trying to get into my pants, and I just don't think of you that way okay. Really, we'll see how you feel when the killer gets you next. You're gonna wish I was there to protect you. Tee? Whatever I'm outta here. Don't act like this. Hey Poncho, can you lock up? You don't know. I've got a killer to catch. ♪ I'm still mad about you ♪ ♪ You're lying here in my bed ♪ Hey Ponch are you leaving? We don't have keys to lockup. ♪ I'm still mad about you ♪ Hello. Dude alright where are you man? We got a lot of work to do tonight. Calm down Tee, I'm just gonna to get Cammi some grub. Where are you? Dude tonight Mark is going to Polly's and Reggie is going to Lace's. Shit is fucked. What do we do, they're gonna be prime targets. Look you go to Lace's you know where it's at. And I'll go to Polly's. Alright cool I'm heading straight over. I just hope it's not too late. Animal enough for you Polly? Yeah Marcus, you're a beast. You're the best of the beasts. Oh Marcus be with me. God I feel so alive. No please, I didn't do anything wrong! Look, look I'll do anything, just let me prove it to you. Yeah there you go look, I can do things for you. I'm really good, I can make you feel so good. I know you didn't mean to be like that. We all lose our heads sometimes. Spill it. Well a neighbor called reporting that they had a dead flesh smell coming from this apartment at O 800 hours today. And this one on the floor is the neighbor from next door. Let me guess, T-shirt killer. Well this fat fuck on the couch right here was a owner of a T-shirt wholesale company. And this lump of shit on the floor was a graphic designer that do T-shirts for the New Orleans African connection. Those fucking pecker woods. Who, the clowns from the print shop? I got enough on these two to stick the book so far up they us they be reading their rights from a flagpole. Oh fuck this shit, these motherfuckers are putrified and it smells like burnt bug wood in here. Hamburgers, I wonder if Art found out anything. Tee. Dude. Tell me you found something. I'm over at Polly's right now and the place is quieter than a fucking corpse man. Dude I'm heading to the shop, can't make it to Lace's. Wait a minute, what why? Cammi called me and she said she's heading over there, she panicked, some shit. I mean she was acting really fucking weird. Yeah go there. They're still working man the shop should be open. I'll swing by Lace's. ♪ Let me see how hard to shove you ♪ ♪ Let's go on ♪ Doesn't he? Yes, yes. Yes what? Yes mistress. That's better, if you keep that up I might let you marinate me with with your stinking disease, soak me with your seasonings and I'll melt in your mouth little boy. Well go check it out hero. Go check it out. Come on you little cock sucker. Come on what you got? Got it. Detective Watson we got to move. Oh fuck, we got to move man. Warrant guaranteed on those two assholes? No I just got two Crime Stoppers tips about separate incidents. There was screaming heard own at 213 Sanan. Who lives at that address? That'd be Polyester Coates sir. Poly Coates. This place is a shit hole. What about the other one? Screams heard on the 2200 block of Acacia Avenue. The neighbors say they hear funny noises coming out of her house all the time but this was different. That's Lace Garter. Below Sea Level. He's closing in and we're standing around here with our dicks in our hands? How's that warrant looking? It's in the works boss. We got the green light on linking these murders. Lab came back and said the blood from the first note was actually the first victim's blood, Juliette Shields. The second, they linked to Hanes. Won't be long now. I'm on my way there myself. Meet me at the Garter residence. You know I really do hope that you and Tee make up. You seem like a good couple. Yeah maybe. Girls like you aren't easy to come by. I really like you Heather. Lock up for me will you? Have a good night. Thank you. Tee talk to me. Looks like got defaced bro. Her house looks like a Tasty Donut on free king cake day. What about Mark and Reggie, anything? No sign bro cocky, look just head back to the shop and look out for the girls okay. Tee, I just thought of something. Do you think it's possible a girl could be the killer? Like someone that we hadn't thought of yet? I'll meet you at the shop. The killer entered through this back door. So keep your eyes on the ground. So it's like they just lined them up to be pork chops the whole time. Almost makes it feel sorry for them. I wanted to string them up myself. But no one deserves what happened here. The boys down at the Coates residence said your buddy Mark took an axe to the skull, and Miss Coates. Yeah I know, decapitated like a tee ball. The note this time read this little piggy has none. That's a lot of bloodshed boss. Bad luck is what it is. Well look like we're back to square one. Looks like our look just changed. Oh wait. Geez you trying to give me a heart attack? I ran all the way from Lace's. Almost made your head a wiffle ball, or a tee ball. Look I think Polly's dead too. I heard something over Watson's bug right before my phone died. What's going on here, is Heather okay? I just pulled up, I'm not sure. But I didn't want to go in empty handed. Well give me something too, what do you got right? Tee man, I just want to say before we go in there last few days have been a real roller coaster ride. But I appreciate you reaching out to me, it means a lot. Really, I kind of got you wrapped up in all this though. Yeah but I'm here to help you finish this. Heather needs you. Yeah. Shit yeah man. Dude what are you doing get me out of this? Finishing the game Tee. You played the perfect pawn but pawns don't last. What the fuck are you talking about? No, no it can't be you, I had you bugged. I should be thanking you for all the information you provided me with. Who knew that your spying could prove to be more useful than just your selfish curiosities? You used me? There's no way you planned this. My plan is of a grander scheme. So when you called me about working here everything just sort of came into place. You see I knew if I knocked off Juliette I'd be her perfect replacement at the shop. But how would you know that I would call you? I knew eventually my name would come up, been laying the foundation for quite some time little piggy. So with Tank caught up in jail and the rest being morgue meat all that's left now is the key witness and his would be dream girl. Man fuck you. And what did you do with Cammi? Did you kill her too, you two faced cheat. It was beautiful, so much blood. The smell of perfume and tears. Cammis death was the most elegant moment. And she's still waiting for me back home. Man you have been huffing too much screen opener you know that? Wait elegant, you are Elegant Decay? You guessed it, and soon everyone will know. I'll do anything to succeed. Where'd you get that? Turns out Hanes was into survival, as am I, survival of the fittest. Cutthroat business calls for cutthroat plans. My plan is flawless, the cops have no idea. There are voices inside, you want me to call for backup? No these chumps are ours. Shoot when you see the whites of their skin. And you think you won't get caught. You are insane. Not that insane. I covered my tracks at Lace's but I didn't cover yours. This whole thing revolves around you. Didn't you think of your little bugs? They all have your fingerprints. Drop the gun! Oh fuck. Watch out for that crazy cracker. I'm glad you pigs showed up. It'll really help me tie up some loose ends here. Speaking of piggies. Heather, Heather. Are you okay? Look who decided to join the party. He killed them all, he's insane. Get me out of here. Insane would be if I didn't take this time to torture you two lovebirds. After all, you're the last two. Art man, she has nothing to do with this man. She doesn't ever wear T-shirts. Are you afraid to see the love of your life deformed? No, no man no, let me take this one. Let me take this one. How romantic. No no! No. You dirty fuck. Well shit man, I been running all over town. Nevertheless, I appreciate the gesture. Too bad, you two would have made a great couple, if you weren't about to die. Please. Not to worry dear. I'm so sorry. It'll be over soon. This little piggy went to market, and this little piggy... Fuck you Bro Chacho. You're gonna pay for that fuck, gallant. This little piggy's about to buy the farm, right, now! He cut of my fucking toe. You got to find my fucking toe, he cut it off. Sit tight guys, everything's gonna be okay. I'll never walk on the beach again. Thanks Henly. How did you know? Don't thank me, thank Poncho, he figured the whole thing out. So you just used me as bait? Sorry about that. So Ponch knew the whole time? Man I bet you figured this all out just listening to everybody in the shop every day. In between my good detective work and Mark and Reggie's interactions with Watson and Tank you figured out it was Art. You knew that him showing up here at the same time of the murders was no coincidence. You're a smart dude. Well maybe you do know something. Well it's over now Heather. You really stood up for me back there. I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you. They're sending an ambulance and the cops are coming. Thanks Henly man, you know you're not so bad after all. Your friend Art really did eliminate the competition. It should be a breeze for me to take over the market now, it's my time to shine. The market is clearly yours bro. I think I'm gonna relocate start fresh, I hear gyno graffiti is really big this time of year out West. You want to join me? Sounds good. This is some bullshit. So excited. Justice has been served, get to start a new life wherever we want, finally get to make love to the girl of my dreams. You are so amazing. Who's your hero baby? Who would have thought it was Art? What's wrong? Why are you crying? You ruined everything! What are you talking about? He is supposed to be here not you. Who? Art? We had everything falling into place. We had Elegant Decay doing so well, and everybody else was out of the way. That's bullshit. He was gonna deform you if I hadn't stepped in. We were just playing the parts until you were dead you fuck. Everything would have been perfect. It was perfect, I played the perfect part. I played the victim until the very end. We can start over, together. Oh Tee. You would rely consider being with me after all of this? Nice shirt.
