brought to You by falang01 China was an unknown, forbidden land. For four centuries, her shores had not been touched by the West. But in the early days of the great sailing ships... Western merchants, drawn by the wonders of tea and silk and jade... teased at her coastline... with the twin seductions of bribery... and opium. In the south of China's vastness... on the edge of the inland city of Canton... they boldly established a trading center... and defied the emperor to act. Jin Qua. From the High Commissioner... of His imperial Majesty... and the Celestial Court. He requires absolutely... to see the leader, the Tai-Pan. We're all taipans. One taipan is the Tai-Pan... Captain Brock. Don't go. He wants you dead. Or for a hostage. You cannot lay siege to British citizens. He demands a speech... with the Tai-Pan. - Do not go into Canton. - He sent for me. Oh,yes. Terrifically true. He kills Tai-Pan, and all barbarians leave China. No more opium. May-may, i'm British. He would not dare to touch me. Your most fastest ships sail to England. Do not see them for nine months-- a year. Your body be rotted and horrifically finished... even before your barbarian queen know you're dead. England has the greatest fighting ships in all the world. Oh, yes, but why we never see one? Even one in China? Because, Tai-Pan, even your barbarian queen knows better than you. No man can resist Celestial Emperor. Burn opium and do not go. May-may is your slave... but please, to grant her one favor for all her life... kowtow to him. i do not kneel to any man. Kill me then. Do not be afraid. Already he has killed many merchants. All of city is terrified. Do not think one barbarian he very hotly detests... will make him a gentle lamb. Hmm. Lin, the imperial High Commissioner... of the Court of Heaven... issues these commands. The barbarians are to deliver... every particle of opium... in their possession... or submit like pirates... to the extreme penalty of the law. - if the imperial Court will allow me-- - Do not speak! Most honorable Lin... emissary of the Celestial Court... China has many riches. if we were allowed to trade freely through all the reaches of China, we-- When the emperor of the Celestial Kingdom... wants trade with barbarian warrior, he will make laws... not foreign devils who sell opium. if opium be surrendered, there would need to be compensation. And then there's the danger the opium will fall into the wrong hands. There will be no compensation. The opium will be burned. Burned? We're talking about thousands of pounds of opium. Oh, quake and tremble at the imperial orders. Do not resist. The humble merchants of the West know the imperial Court... has many expenses to bear. Tai-Pan, the opium will be destroyed. You and all the merchants must leave Canton. That's good. Over here. Damn you to hell! Honorable Tai-Pan. Father. i thought i would stay and arrange to bring May-may to Macao. - if that is your wish. - Of course, but be careful. Trust no one. i'm sorry for this. i should have judged the man face to face before i assumed he was like all the rest. But Lin or no Lin, Noble House will live for 200 years. Gordon, you remember that... in every act you do. Now, steady strokes, lads. Come on.! Struan, I should have broken your back when you were an arrogant cabin boy. I meant to. i was a fool not to. Right, lads. Keep it steady now. Nearly there. Come on. They must have rode all night. What's going on? Mr. Brock. - Mr. Brock, what has happened? - The China trade be done. They burned the opium. Heave away, lads. Manoel, there's something i want to show ya. We're changing course. - East nor'east. - East nor'east, sir. i'm going to show you destiny's gift to taipan. The island of Hong Kong. A sailor's dream, Vargas. Deep water. Safe. And now she's going to be England's. - England's? - Yes, Manoel. I'm going back to England. And I'm going to use every penny I have to convince Parliament... that the country cannot allow her merchants to be humiliated by a medieval monarch. And we're going to demand a piece of China for England-- this piece of China. I, Captain Glessing, Royal Navy... do hereby take possession of this island... Hong Kong... on this day... the 26th ofJanuary, 1 841 . This soil... is now British soil. God save the queen.! Shoulder! Arms! Parade will march off in column of route.! Left... turn.! Forward... march! Right wheel. Eyes left! dd - Eyes front.! - We sail and fight in these waters like pirates for years... - Right wheel.! - and when we finally convince the navy to whip the Chinese... he gets the government to take this-- this clump of rock-- this trophy. it looks the safest harbor i've seen in these waters, Tyler. - it's not safe harbor we're needin'. - dd We could have demanded trading rights in six Chinese cities. Shanghai, Nanking. Instead we take this bloody rock. Well... what he can do with Parliament i can do. i mean to make the government see sense. dd - Ah. - Captain Glessing, sir. Congratulations. - Thank you, Struan. - Very nicely done. - We'll probably have a celebration. Horatio you know. - We might have a drink. - An historic occasion. Thank you. - Your lads did you proud. I have a little proclamation of my own, if you don't mind, Captain Glessing. Of course. On behalf of the Noble House... of which i be the immodest taipan... I wish to invite all the merchants... their beautiful wives and ladies... to a grand ball... to be celebrated in two months... when our building will be completed on that commanding knoll. - Tai-Pan. - Get up here, you. And to honor the beauty... that has come from Macao to gather with us today... i'll be giving a L1 000 prize... - to the best-dressed lady at that ball. - Ooh. To be judged by that incomparable artist... Aristotle Quance. You're trying to ruin me, Tai-Pan. And i'll wager any man here that a Noble House ship... Morning Cloud, will be the first ship of commerce... to anchor in that harbor... - the envy of all the world. - Hear! Hear! I have here L200... says the White Witch will be unloaded... before Morning Cloud is seen on the horizon. - Ooh. - By God, Brock... you've been dipping into the rum before the chaplain's blessed the feast. God save the queen! Ohhh.! - Steady now. - Hold it. - Very commendable effort, Tai-Pan. - Oh, that was terrible. Aye. Ah, Mary... if your father came to China to save souls... he should never have produced a daughter who could so easily drive men to sin. Ah. i'm in absolute agreement, Mr. Struan. i notice i've never tempted you to fall from grace, Tai-Pan. Mary, my dear sister. That is only because, my dear Mary... i defer to the superior claim of Captain Glessing. dd Ah, the "Heart of Loch Lomond." You must excuse me. - dd - dd Extraordinary man. Do you know about his-- his China lady? We've known all about the Tai-Pan ever since we were children. And we owe him a great deal. Since your father's death, you mean? And before. Long before. Waiting for another ceremony... to complete your sketch, Mr. Quance? No, i'm waiting for the highest bidder. i shall put him center. How about you, Mr. Tillman? Have you a taste for being in history? What i've a taste for, Mr. Quance, is decency. My niece just told me that you've induced her to let you paint her nude. As every white man in the Far East not addicted to opium or sailors... has tried to seduce or marry your niece at some time or other... i dare say you can trust her to art. And i promise you, Uncle, no man'll ever see it. Except for my future husband. it's not the art that concerns me, Mr. Quance. it's the artist. A man who lives in a house of ill-repute, hiding from his wife. Uncle, please. On the first yardarm.! How far? - Aye, aye, boatswain.! - Two leagues. - Maybe three. - Is it enough? Enough to put bile in their blood. A quarter starboard. Don't you see the wind shift? That Orlov's a wizard. When God gave him a hunchback, he put a compass in his head. My father beat Orlov. And, by God, one day i'll do it too. Get that mainsheet pulled in! Aye, aye, sir.! They'll not catch us. it's these waters we're approaching now. The South China Sea. They'll be your new home. And here be your father's Hong Kong. i think he make powerful mistake. Huh. Who knows? The Tai-Pan has fantastic joss. -Joss? - Luck. is, uh, Chinese. it really means, uh, favored by God. i'm not so sure that's true. it looks like one of the Noble House ships. Morning Cloud. Look here. This has to be seen to. i'll have a word with my commanding officer. Culum! Culum.! Culum! Culum, i did not know. My God, i'm glad to see ya! Oh, Father. For the love of God, don't. Culum, i tell you that nothing this nine months has made me happier than the sight of thee. Father, the plague has struck Glasgow again. Mama, my brother... my sisters, Grandma-- By God's will, they're all gone. You and i are all that is left. God, i knew it. This island i so longed for... what price is it going to take? Yes, Gordon? My apologies. i was asked by Mr. Brock to present you with L200. Thank you, my son. It's the White Witch. Would you, um-- Would you join me for a farewell tankard, Miss Tess? Captain, i-- it may be our last chance for such, uh... civility. This afternoon your mom will come aboard. And your brother, Mr. Gorth, will be bringing your father aboard. Oh, Tess. Tess, i love thee. i love thee. i want you in Macao tomorrow. i'll be there. i've dreamed of going ashore at Macao for months. Mr. Brock, sir. We'll take her into the Pearl to unload on the noon tide. Alert the crew. We lift anchor at dawn. Sir, welcome aboard. i was just looking to see if Miss Tess was all right. - i was but checking, sir. - Go below. i don't want to be discussing this around the crew. Mr. Brock, i didn't touch her. - i didn't harm her, by God. - You're a dead man, Nagrek. i did nothing, sir. i swear. i were only checking-- You put your stinkin' hands under her shift. No harm i done, i swear. it were only play. i just want him dead. He'll be dead. But he won't die a man. It was little Winnie who got it first. Then Jamie. it's funny. it was Winnie who got it first... but she lived the longest. Do i have to do this? i bathed before i left Glasgow. You must bath every week, Culum. You stink. Everyone stinks. That's why we wear pomades. - it's unhealthy bathing. - i dinna stink. The Chinese dinna stink. Phew. When did you last wash these? - Why, never. it would ruin the cut. - i'll get you new ones... and you'll wash them every week. And when you use the head, you'll wipe your ass with paper and wash your hands. - Why? - The Chinese think dung makes people sick. - That's crazy. in London, no-- - Forget London. The Chinese dinna smell. And they dinna get sick in this heat like Europeans. Just because they dinna make good cannon, dinna be fooled. They're a smart, wise people. And every ship of mine runs on the rules they taught me. You make these heathens out to be smarter than-- And you'll drink tea like they do too, not water. Aye. Your guests be Mr. Brock and Mr. Gorth, sir. Thank you, Captain Orlov. i'll not interrupt your China habit. First, i tell you i'm sorry for what happened to your family. Aye. You've been busy... with your agent in London. Well, i've been busy too these 1 2 months past. But with commerce. Not chasing barren islands. The boy's water is chilling, Brock. State your piece. Gladly. You're bankrupt, Struan. Bankrupt. Gorth has come back from London with L1 ,200,000 of notes... drawn against Noble House and your London bank. My agents bought up every last one of them... and they're due at month's end. And i'll be givin' no credit, acceptin' no goods. When time's up, I'll be taking over every ship in your fleet. i'd sink them first. You? Sink a clipper? Never. You have 23 days left as Tai-Pan. Enjoy them if you can. Gorth, we're gone. Your joss has turned, Struan. Orlov, Vargas. The money we needed to buy votes, did MacGregor tell you where it came from? The bank sold notes against future trade. - You authorized it. - Notes to whom? in the market. i gave them no specific instructions. i don't imagine he would know. My God. To Brock. Maybe my joss has turned. For your very great loss... my heart is full of sadness. May-may... i have much business today... and i will make certain arrangements. You must do exactly as i say. Of course. Don't i always most times? i may have to sell thee, May-may. It will be to someone kindly. And I will try to get you the place of supreme lady. i-- i thank you, lord. i burned incense for safe rebirth of the supreme lady... and her children. Everywhere today i'm told... Noble House must pay in silver. No credit. Unless Tai-Pan produces a miracle... the ships will return without silk or tea. The Tai-Pan's cargo does not contain miracles today. it is hard to believe, Tai-Pan. i must tell you that my mother spent the night in tears. Aye. Your mother. At sea you learn that what is given can be taken away, Gordon. Worry about yourself, lad. Not about me. i was a privateer before... and by week's end i'll take Morning Cloud from under Brock's nose and be one again. And then i'll be back to haunt him. Tai-Pan, if I could help. Aye, i was counting on it. - Have you heard of the pirate Wu Fang Choi? - Of course. He's on Amoy, i'm told. i'm sending you to him. i have need of safe harbor. Tai-Pan. "The Noble House is in need. "These men will lead you to a friend. Come secretly." - Do not do it. - i have need of friends, Gordon. Even dangerous ones. Stay silent till sunset. Then if you've heard nothin'... bring Orlov and the crew of Morning Cloud and find me. You look see. Mary. Hello, Tai-Pan. You need not worry. Jin Qua has gone down the other stairs. i'm not worried. - i'm disgusted. - Why? Because i like to go to bed with Chinese? You're a strange one to feel that. You're a woman... and a child. I don't want your drink. - Why have you done this? - Because you need my help. And i had to prove to you i could deliver it. i would rather have tried to make you mine. By the sweetJesus... i'm lost. This is not the Mary Sinclair i know. Yes, it is. Mary Sinclair, the innocent... who loves church... and singing and knitting, is also me. We are all that way, Tai-Pan. Look at you. Devil, smuggler... prince, murderer, husband, father, fornicator... saint. Which is you? - i'm sending you back to England. - You don't have the power now. ButJin Qua can restore it. And Jin Qua is my lover. He will have a price... but he will do it. i owe you that. - You owe me nothin'! - You've never been beaten. You stopped my father from beating me... but not my brother... from comforting me. May-may was more a virgin at 1 4 than i was, Tai-Pan. Arrange to seeJin Qua. He's returning to Canton. He will be waiting. Aristotle. Mr. Quance. Mr. Quance! Mr. Quance. - You must come quick. - Great balls of fire. What is it, Mrs. Fotheringill? it's Gorth. And he won't be stopped. The man's a menace. Out of the way. Open this door, you dung-eater! Open up! What do you want? Get your clothes on... and get out of here. Gently with her. Gently now. Oh, God. i don't want you back here. That's for her. And that's for keeping your mouth shut. God's blood! You ought to be beaten like that yourself. The Tai-Pan's time is coming to an end. And when it does, i'll look for you. i don't know why you worry. You only pick 'em off the street anyway. i'll be back. Jin Qua. Please, eat. I am told the Imperial Commissioner Lin... has been banished. Oh, yes. He's blamed for losing Hong Kong to British. Forty lac dollars. All silver. Forty lac? That would take Brock off my throat and then some. - if anyone knew it was here-- - i borrowed it. ifTai-Pan wants to borrow it from me... i think Tai-Pan will pay. How Tai-Pan pay? Noble House... buys only from Jin Qua... and Jin Qua's sons... for 1 0 years. ifJin Qua sell at market price. Plus 1 0%. Hmm. Five. Eight. Five. - Seven. - Five. Seven. All right. You sellJin Qua five lac dollars' land in Hong Kong. Hong Kong plan is wise. You sell toJin Qua in the name of your improper boy chillo... Gordon Chen. if that is your wish. Well, after midnight... I will deliver silver to your warehouse. And then... you are in my debt. You can use my lorcha for getting downriver to Hong Kong. The risk is yours. i will send my safest men. But... 40 lacs of silver... would make rich many, many Chinese families... for generations. And you are... but a barbarian. Well... I leave you to enjoy your meal. Zai jian. - Zai jian. - Zai jian. What are you toJin Qua, Gordon? What the Tai-Pan is to the British... Jin Qua is to the Chinese. i am proud to be British, but i am also proud to be Chinese. And i am proud of you. ThankJin Qua. Tell him his news filled me too much to enjoy the delicacies he offered. Another time. Eat. They make you very potent. it is fantastical true. Prawns are very important for your figure. That may be. But do you have to eat the heads? Ahh. Dinna ken? They're the best part. That'll teach ya. i think... they are beginning... to work. By God... i've given you too much already. More. Just one more. i want you to be fantastical good. That lump of dog meat Brock is breaking you by huge monies owed. - is it true? - Who told you? it is terrifical simple to solve this business. No sell May-may. Kill Brock. - it is time now. - That's one way. i've thought of it. One way, another way-- you think of a way. Will i? Yes. After tonight, you remember for sure... you do not want to lose May-may. i've paid for you, and too much. Ay-ya! You not the only man in China! When i was virgin,Jin Qua could have sold me easy to Manchu prince... even to the emperor for a thousand taels! i was Jin Qua's gift to you for China trade. i know... you're not stupid. You will beat Brock... because i please you too much. Now, come to me, Tai-Pan. No. it gives me pleasure... and it is my duty. Your custom is man have only one wife, ay-ya? Aye. Chinese custom more better. Many wives. How soon will you marry? What is the custom? - Oh, i dunna think i'll marry again. - You should-- an English or Scottish. But, first, you should marry me. So for once, i be your supreme lady. Aye, perhaps i should. Aye, perhaps you should. Come, lass. it is time. This filthy dirt destroys my perfection. - You owe me 50 cash to repair. - Come on. What for two girl chillos, hya? No can. - What your name? - Wung. Girl chillos belong me. Cast off, Wung. Tai-Pan.! Tai-Pan.! No.! And now for you, laddie.! Come here. What's this mean, Culum doin' a land auction? Exactly, my dear Tai-Pan. Captain Glessing did it to honor you... and hoping, no doubt, that given the honor... you won't embarrass him by bidding. Whatever his motives, i did not think... the man had that much stomach. My God. How long has that been goin' on? The young men choose their own friends. It's one of the hardest lessons ofbeing a parent. You'd know. Well, i may not have performed like a parent... but i have suffered as one. i'm sure. i'd be grateful, Aristotle, if you'd put it about... that i'm havin' a tea at my tents this afternoon... and i'm particularly invitin' Mr. Brock. My pleasure. Oh, by the way... as a certain lady was sitting for me... i learned that she's in flux for you. Absolutely lovesick. Now that you're eligible again, you've taken on a certain charm... even if you are bankrupt. dd - Good day, Miss Johnson. - Beautiful day. That's enough, please. Thank you. Ah! - Mother, this be Culum Struan, once heir to Noble House. - Culum. My pleasure, ma'am. i've never thought of myself as that. Still, it was true, lad. And if there be ought left when your father pays his bills... it'll be left to you. i hear you're a God-fearing lad. Though I'm no friend of your father, I'm pleased to meet you proper. - Oh, Tyler. - Well. it's best the boy knows the truth. And whatever he holds against me for defeating his father... i expect the auction today to be done fair. it will be, i assure you. And this be my sister Tess. Culum Struan. - it is my honor, miss. - Mr. Struan. The Tai-Pan asked my father... to bring along the sight drafts he holds against Noble House. Has he decided not to bid? i don't know. i know that he wants the knoll badly... but i hope he will not bid. - Mary. - Tai-Pan. is Quance paintin' your portrait? No. Well, Dirk, champagne? Well, you always did have a style about you... even in defeat. i'm honored that you've come. Mrs. Brock. Tess. You too, Gorth. Now, Tyler, i wonder if you'd do me the courtesy... to let me see the sight drafts you say you hold against Noble House. i don't say. They're here for your own eyes. Check them against the ledger, Mr. Vargas. One million, two hundred thousand, Mr. Vargas. Make sure you add them right. Prawns are right tasty, Dirk. You can tell your cook he'll have a job with the new owner. i'll pass the message along. Now if you can free your hand, i'd like you to sign this receipt for me. - What's that for? - All correct, Mr. Struan. i've decided to pay in cash. i assume that's acceptable. Don't you pull one of your damn tricks on me. Captain Orlov, please. Haul away, lads. He's done it.! It's all been weighed. But there's a scale if you wish to check the amount. God rot you to hell, Struan. Gorth! Get your bully boys ashore on the double, armed! Every heathen pirate in Asia will be on our backs. Captain Glessing... i'm asking your marines to guard this till i get it safely aboard a clipper. Aye, Mr. Brock. it'll be my pleasure, sir. Buy yourself a coffin. Mr. Brock! Mr. Brock! Let me tell you this! You do that auction fair, or no man'll save thee-- not thy father, not anyone. And i'll have that knoll. if he tries to outbid me, i'll use his own silver to drive him back to bankruptcy. You tell him that. Brock and Son will be the taipans. And the last lot-- 1 1 2-B. - The bids will open at L1 00. - Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, the last lot? What about the knoll? Aye, the knoll. The knoll has already been purchased. - Purchased by whom? - By me for the church. Captain Glessing agreed to the deed. One pound a year. A church will be built on the knoll. - It will belong to all. - You knew that land was for Noble House. The knoll belongs to the house of God. You dare to cross me on this? Oh, shut up, Brock! Tell Culum i want him on his knoll. - Mr. Struan, i'm sure he only meant to do good. - i want him alone! - Honorable Tai-Pan, the boy-- - Tomorrow morning. Thy days are numbered, lad. You know how to make enemies on all sides. The view's extraordinary, do you not agree? - if the church is not built on the knoll-- - i know all about the church. i'm not afraid of ya. - You can kill me if you like, but you'll hang for it. - You think i'd kill ya? When i came here, you were God to me. Now i think you be the devil. i know you were a murderer and worse. Come here. - Sit down. - i'm all right standin'. There's a wondrous land across that water, Culum. A strange, silent world that stretches for leagues and leagues... like an unsailed sea, and more people than we could ever dream of. - They hate us. - Aye, some do. I feel I was meant to bring them to us and us to them. About the church... i want you to understand that i was not defying you. it was the only way. i know. With all that silver, Brock would have slaughtered us. i couldn't have stopped it. - The knoll was a matter of face. - And you weren't angry? Oh, aye, i was... at first. But then i saw it saved me, and it gave you face. But you lost face. Oh, aye. But i've enough, and to spare. Now, why be i the devil? You trade in opium. You smuggle. - You've done it for years. - Aye. And what did you think i did? i thought you traded goods from England for tea from China. The emperor will not let us sell goods from England... yet he demands silver for his tea. And if we paid in silver, it would bankrupt England in a year. So we sell opium to the Chinese for their silver and give it back to them for tea. That's how the China trade works. - Opium for tea? - Aye. Why not? - i didn't invent opium, nor the trade. - Aye. You did not invent adultery either, but that doesn't make it right. Culum, you do not understand. How old is Gordon? - Nineteen or 20. - He's my age. And he's your son also. And you sold his mother to Chen Sheng when you tired of her... - and bought yourself a new mistress. - I did not sell her.! i gave her away with a dowry. She became Chen's third wife, and she is respected. And then you bought a new, younger woman. Culum, i've not been livin' in Throgmorton Street. - This is the custom here. - Mr. Brock has one wife. Brock's wife is here! Your mother spent one year in Macao... and then went home never to return. Culum, i want you to take over from me. i need to be in London to stop Brock's maneuvers. And i want to be your friend. You are my father. There is nothin' i can do about that. But i choose my friends. - Tillman. - Sorry to arrive uninvited, Struan... - but Shevaun insisted. - Shevaun? it's an old American custom to wish a new house well. - You're both very welcome. - We cannot stay. - But we brought some gifts for the house... - Aye. to bring luck. Some bread, baked by my own hands. - Your own hands? - Yes. Some salts... wine... and something i found in the market in Macao. it's most unexpected. i'm very grateful. Well, now that we've done our duty, we'll be off. You must stay for some sherry. Oh, no. Uncle's right. We've intruded enough. i'll look forward to seein' you at the ball. Well, i hear men are placin' bets... - on the winner of your prize. - So i've heard. Were it not partial of me to do so... i can assure ya where my money would be. Ah. Tea. Ay-ya! That maggoty-drawers dung-heap doxy is after you to marriage her! Marry, not marriage. And how do you know? You did not even see her. What for should i work over plans of house god-rotting hour after hour... to see and not to be seen? Kiss the hand, huh? What for you no kiss my hand, ay-ya? What for you linger with cow eyes? Ay-ya. Mens. Men, not mens. Men! "i am told mens are placin' bets... on the winner of your prize." And you stand there and eat up her bosoms! What for my bosom you not stare at, ay-ya? May-may, i do. i do, May-may. Mass'er, where you want these? Ay-ya.! All right, lass! Two's fine, but three's extravagant! May-may, it cost the earth.! It's from England.! isn't this splendid? You look very beautiful, i must say. Ah, look at them. French, German, Russian, American. They were all forbidden in China, but now they can land here, trade here. Oh, it's a glorious night, Mary Sinclair. - They all thought you mad. Even i had my doubts. - dd Well, it had to be. i knew in my China bones... it was my fate to make it be no matter what. it may have its price. I tell you, out here miles from home... more things can happen between a boy and a girl at one ball like this... than in a year of normal life. And how would you know? This is your home. Perhaps. When the fleet returns to india... Captain Glessing's staying on as commander of the harbor. - He's asked for my hand. - Really? it may only be the ball, but i'm sorely tempted. - He's a fine man. - Yes. But do you think the Mary you know would be a fine wife for him? if you marry him proper... he would be a blessed man, whatever the past. dd i love this one. it's my favorite. My God. She does not give you much of a choice when it comes to judging. Oh, Manoel, you're like the rest. You're all transfixed by her tits. True, they are impeccable... but the contest is for the best dressed... not the best undressed. dd I think we could have a marriage. - You're mad. - Mad? i've been encouraging it everywhere i could. They need not marry. Just be engaged. No, they should marry. She loves him, i know. And he her. That's enough to overcome whatever she might have done. By the way... the Tai-Pan wants to go back to England. And if he runs into money troubles... he'll have to. He's going to leave Culum in charge. Before he knows what's happened... it'll be Brock, Struan and Sons. - How are you so close to Culum? - i told him... our fathers may hate... but it would be un-Christian for us to do the same. Instead of destroying each other, we should be friends. - And Culum's a right religious lad. - And he be right. Struan has always had the most fantastic joss. But in the end, God be givin' me thee, Gorth... and him only Culum. Thee be my joss. - dd - Thank you very much. May-may, you sent for me at a very poor time. Supreme lady say you sit, please. God's blood! i mean, it's very nice. May-may! May-may.! May-may, open the door! Forgive me, master! Forgive me! May-may, you took me for surprise. May-may. May-may. May-may, stop it! Stop it! Stop. Wait. i fix. - i fix. - All right. May-may-- Put that knife down, May-may! May-may-- Did ya expect to come to the ball? No. No, it was only for you to see. Stop it, lass. it's all right. it was just a surprise. Please, you go, mass'er. All right now. Never mind. No worry. Watch her close. - i'll send Ah Sam to help. - Yes, mass'er. Yes, mass'er. dd She'd make a fine wife. in England, she'd do a man no end of, uh, good socially. Yes. Expensive, but useful. Captain Glessing seems to be enamored with Mary. if someone of your stature were to mention Shevaun... i feel sure he'd realize he was missing a great opportunity. i know all about Glessing and Mary... and i would not like to hear... that anyone i knew-- knew well-- interfered with their own decision. dd Tai-Pan, my dear fellow, it's time for thejudging. Very good, Aristotle. Well, you were the life of the party. What's the matter? it's May-may. She's lost face with me. Oh, it is the Chinese curse. You'll have to beat her. You must play the man. Mr. Quance! Great thunderballs of death! 'Tis herself, my blessed lady! Mr. Quance,you were due back in England three years ago.! 'Twas only by the grace of St. Patrick... that i found passage to this immoral lair! Now take me hand, for 'tis time for you to say good night... and we be on our way. Mrs. Quance, Aristotle has a task to perform. - Yes. - We be on our way. Say good night, me boyo. - Good night, Tai-Pan. - Beat her! - And now, we're without a judge. - Tai-Pan? As a stranger for the very first time in Hong Kong... may i have that honor? - The czar's fleet to the rescue. - Of course. Ladies and gentlemen, as you well know... there is a contest to bejudged this evening. i'm afraid our immortal Quance is otherwise engaged. But His Highness, the Archduke Zergeyev... has volunteered to make the L1 ,000 choice. i believe this belongs to you, Miss Brock. Very nice. This slave begs her master to sell her. You're not a slave, and you'll not be sold. Please to sell... to anyone, to whorehouse, to another slave. You're not for sale. This slave have no face before her lord and owner. She cannot live here. Get up. You have not offended me. You surprised me. European clothes do not suit you. i will not sell ya. But if you dinna want to stay... you're entirely free to leave. Please to sell. Until owner sell, a slave cannot go. By God. You are a miserable slave. i've a mind to sell you into the street of blue lanterns. But who'd want to buy a dirty baggage like you? i dinna ken. I paid good silver for ya... and i was cheated, by God. - Am i not good to ya? Eh? Generous? - Yes, lord. You thievin', miserable slave. i'm gonna whip ya till my arm hurts. Lie down there.! Go on! You dare to get clothes made behind my back! No whip too hard! i'm three months with child! You dare to wear them without my approval! You worthless, dirty slave! How i put up with you these years, i dinna ken! Stop your wailin'! Come, remove my shoes. is it true? You be with child? Go wash yourself. And bring me tea, you motherless wretch. Quickly! Gorth. Thank God. i want to ask your father for Tess's hand. Go home, Tess. Good night. You look all hot and bothered. i know what you need. Come on. You be with child? Well, if that be the case, i may give you another chance. Yes, please. Please, forgive. But it better be a son. Now, get into bed. i'm cold. in time, i may be forgiving you, lass. in time. i really do not think i should. Don't worry, Culum. it's no sin here. it's only trade. The girls need the business. Evening, girls. No. No! You've got to know the ropes, Culum. it's expected. And, believe me, you won't mind learning. Will he, lads? Oh, to be a virgin like Culum. - Did you do it? - Yes. - But it was a sin. - Ah, well, you be used to sin. Well, at least now he'll know what to do when he marries young Tess. Never, by God! He think he be marryin' Tess, but he'll never. Our Christian Culum is a bit hot in the groin... and he isn't used to honest drinking. She's fixed him up with the most poxed whore in all Macao. He's at it with her right now. By the time he's finished... he won't be fit for any woman, and never for Tess! No. No, listen. it's all right. You're lovely. it's just when i felt this locket-- if you could just see her, you'd understand. i can't. Plenty good, master. Me can do special. Make you want to jig-a-jig. No more charge. No, listen, i'm gonna pay all the same. Christ, if i just dinna get sick. Your boy and mine be like old shipmates. Aye. They are. 'Tis about Tess i come to see you. Your boy wants to marry her. i'm against it... but the girl and her mother, they talked me into it. Somehow, i thought they would. Her dowry will be the richest in all Asia. - They be marryin' next year. - i'll see ya in hell first. That be later, Dirk. That be later. First, they be marrying. i know what's in your mind, and Gorth's... but i'll not let you break Noble House through a girl's skirts. i hate your guts and i always will... but she loves Culum, and that's the mortal truth. She'll get over it. You don't love your Culum the way i love my Tess. i'll tell you this. You give them a fair wind and an open sea... and I'll be doin'likewise. You know, when i was a cabin boy... and you were a bully of a third mate... I despised ya. But by the Lord, I never dreamed you'd sink... to using your own daughter to get something you're not man enough to take on your own. i'll use the devil to break you. And by God... break you i will. i know what's puttin' you in bed. You eat too many prawns. You're not mad at me for coming back to the old house, are you? No, if you want the baby here in Macao, that's fine. Maybe next month, no sick. We go to Hong Kong. - Aye. - Mass'er. Mass'er. Mass'er, young Mass'er Culum outside. He look plenty sour. - Now you sad again. - I have to get him back. i've tried every way, but Gorth has some hold on him. - It is no good killing son of Brock. - Why not? You risk vengeance of insane barbarian law... what demands eye for eye, whoever has eye, which is crazy mad. - No, don't get up. - i walk with you very careful. Do not argue. You make me more sick. Now, my counsel is... have fantastical quick marriage here-- Culum to Tess. That's out of the question. i have nothin' against Tess... but with a little time he'll find another girl. Oh, i agree very heatedly, Tai-Pan. But i seems to memory that barbarian custom... which for once follows wise Chinese custom: girl comes to house of husband. Ay-ya? So sooner Brock girl marries... sooner Gorth lose control over simple Culum. i'm not so sure. Married, Gorth will feel he's even more right to interfere. By God, i am! What for is your son so sick crazy in the head? He needs to bed her fantastical bad. That's what's making him crazy sick. He's frantical hot. So he listens with tongue hanging out to every word... that crazy Gorth say. Please, Tai-Pan, let him have girl. Then will he spend hour after god-rot hour... listening to brother Gorth? By God, no! He spends every minute in bed... playing bosoms... exhausting himself making babies. Mmm. And he detest interruption... from you or from Gorth, hy-ya? We're comin' into the season of storms. Pretty soon you'll have to wear your hair in pigtails like i do. i've been talkin' to Orlov. He believes tea will grow in india. They have the same rains and the same heat. Aye, probably. The Chinese will not let you take seeds or plants. it's an imperial edict, and death that one. With enough daring and a little squeeze, we could get hundreds of plants. Gordon has already got dozens. Are you suggesting we bribe and smuggle and steal? Well, i'd rather do that than live by smugglin' opium. - Have you discussed this with Gorth? - Not yet. i'm sending you to Hong Kong this afternoon. You're to go in Morning Cloud. And i'm puttin' Orlov under your orders. For this trip, you'll be master. - is that so important? - To me, yes. Do i have time to say good-bye to Tess? Aye. You can catch the noon tide. Since you're so set on it, lad, i've changed my mind about Tess. Only it seems a pity Brock insists on you waitin'a year to marry. Aye. 'Tis, but he will not bend. To be truthful, i'm surprised you've not considered... taking your lives into your own hands. - Elope? - Aye. Why not? No, i suppose Brock would be furious, and certainly Gorth. It's a bad idea. i know it's not necessary... but i want you to explain to Captain Orlov... that i'm makin' you absolute master. And by the powers vested in me... i now pronounce you man and wife. And may God have mercy on us all... when your father hears of it. Wait outside, Tai-Pan. She's all right. Weak, but all right. i'm sorry about the baby. it was a boy, but it had no chance. She'd like to see you. Bad joss lose baby, Tai-Pan. Unworthy slave very sorry. Unworthy slave is not to worry. She is good joss. How else did she come to Tai-Pan? Oh. Dinna scare me with all my past disastrous. 'Tis not fair, laddie. i want your son terrifical bad. i know, lass. i know. You sleep now, lass. if you hurry up and get better, i'll give you a hundred taels of silver. You give me huge face, Tai-Pan. Oh, mind. May-may more gorgeous after tragedy. Going to make you fantastical happy. Struan! You planned it. You told Orlov to marry 'em! Our Tess wedded to that pox-ridden bastard! No.! Stop them.! Stop them.! - No! - Let me go, for Christ's sake! He knows! Culum be poxed! - Culum's not poxed. - He be.! Everyone knows he was in the whorehouse in Macao.! - i paid for it myself!. - Let him go, lads. This is no place to fight! Tomorrow at dawn. - You be a dead man. - Hire a junk. i want witnesses and a fair fight. i choose fightin' irons. - Look out! - Tai-Pan! Dear God. Your blasted joss! Someday. Someday. Gorth went for him with a knife. it wasn't his fault, Tyler. - We all saw it. - Gorth started it. Struan? i want you on your precious knoll that was to be. You come alone at dawn. i know now it be God's will. -Gorth started it, Tyler. - He didn't mean to-- - Be still! He killed my son. Hurry! Get inside! Move! You planned the elopement, didn't ya? i did. You planned to kill my Gorth. Gorth chose his fate. We all do, Brock. Your island is done, Tai-Pan. We're getting off this blasted rock. A royal commission's come, and that's my doin'. That's why I wanted you here. I should have killed you years ago. Now, by God, i'll do it. You're a fool. As long as i breathe, you'll not be safe. The eye. The eye of the storm. We're going into the eye of the storm. Ay-ya. Ay-ya. - Has it stopped? - Yes, it's just a trickle. Get the tongs. Bring me a coal from the fire. Get the tongs! i've got to cauterize it. You can be sick later. Culum, have you seen Captain Glessing? Tai-Pan! Tai-Pan! Have you seen Mary? Or Glessing? i must find her. i caught her maid and whipped the truth out of her. Mary's a whore! i must warn Glessing. He'll never marry a whore of the Chinese! She'll come back to me! She has no choice! Get to shelter, Horatio! it's comin' back! No! Aaah! My God, Tai-Pan! Do not leave me! Never, lass. i'll never leave thee. - Where shall we hide? - No hiding from a typhoon. You ride her out or you do not. We'll wait for the sun together. Do you not love me, laddie? You are my supreme lady. You must laugh when you say that... or you break my heart. 'Tis no laughin' matter. There. So that was the China lady. Why couldn't i talk to him? Mr. Quance, please. Please leave me alone. i'm sorry, lad. i haven't the strength to go back down. i'm sorry about your dad. it was his fate. -Joss rules us all in the end. - i hate that word. The oldest story in the world... is of sons who didn't appreciate their fathers until they were dead. i wouldn't make a cross of it. L-Look, look, i know it's a bad time to bring it up, Tai-Pan... but could you conceivably lend me 1 50 guineas? - What did you say? - Oh, it's as embarrassing for me as it is for you, Tai-Pan... but that old witch Fotheringill-- she's so upset about the damage to her houseboat... she's going to throw me out unless i pay her. - You called me Tai-Pan. - Well... you are, aren't you? Master Culum. - Aye. - Captain Brock sent a parcel of orders aboard my ship. What orders? He ordered us to put the flag at half-mast. Something that didn't need his telling. He also ordered your missus to go aboard the White Witch... and to tell you not to worry, he was arranging your dad's funeral... and would dispose of the China lady. He said you'd be joining him now, and i was to-- is that your wishes? Gordon will make the arrangements for our father's funeral. And it is my wishes... he and his lady be buried together. Then go aboard White Witch and fetch my wife. - "Fetch"? - Aye. Fetch. And take as many men as you think you'll need. And, Captain Orlov, give these to Brock. They're his gold sovereigns. Tell him... if it's a funeral he wishes to arrange... the Tai-Pan suggests he buy himself a coffin. Aye, aye... Tai-Pan.
