You're late again, Roxy. Sorry, I was dealing with some shit. You know I got to dock you, right? Come on, Stag! You know the rules! You show up late, you get fined. Whatever. We were actually just talkin' about you. What about me? You might wanna ease up on your "No Touch" policy when you take a date into the champagne room. It's not my policy, it's the club's. And why am I getting shit for being the only one who follows it? No offense, Ladies. Come on, Rox. No guy wants to sit on his hands with a hard on. If he wants to grab a tit or some ass, what's the harm? The harm comes when the jerk off tries to stick a thumb up my ass. That's what we have a bouncer for. If a gentleman pushes that stick further up your ass, call Will. Alana, you have to be on my side with this. Oh, um... Well, I don't wanna disappoint anyone. I mean, I've never had a thumb up there, but... Well I do let the guys feel me up if they want to. Hey, let's face it, Rox. If you don't let them have their fun, they're not gonna want another dance. Or worse, they'll let all the other guys know that you don't let them do anything. No guy wants to pay $30 a song just to watch you wiggle your tits and ass. As nice as they are. I mean, if I wanted 100% no touching, I'd fucking work at Hooters or some shit. It's up to you. You wanna make money, or you wanna enforce the rules? Fuck the rules, I wanna make money. Money, money, money. Ow! You greedy little slut. My champagne room isn't your personal ATM. You wanna work here, you haul your ass out on stage. Stag... I put in my time like everybody else. Really? Everyone gets so drunk they hang off the pole like a retarded sloth? I mean, a customer buys me drink, I'm not supposed to drink it? I'm not saying you can't have a few drinks, but you gotta stop short of pissing in your panties. You disrespect my stage again, and I'll put you out with the garbage. Sorry, Stag. Won't happen again. That's my girl. Now get your shit on and get out there. All of you! You need something? Listen, I'm sorry about being late. Think you could throw me a warning this time? Please? I kind of need the cash right now. That's my problem, how? You need more money? Hustle harder. You're still here? Uh, yeah. Look, if any of the girls don't want their shifts, can you let me know? I'll snag any open ones. Let me guess. Your ex-boyfriend fucked you over, now you're up to your tits in debt. Way to be a fucking cliche, Rox. Please, Stag. I'll see what I can do, but you gotta show me you deserve the extra time. Now beat it. So how are you holding up? Two hours and I haven't even worked off my fine yet. Stag's an asshole. Man, the things I'd like to do to him. Tell me about it. I'd love to crush his nuts with my stiletto. Tie his dick up so tight he can never use it again. Jam a hot steel rod up his pecker. Now you've got me all wet. I'm gonna have to go finger myself in the bathroom. Check it out. Shelby's got Belly Button Bob. Oh, you know, I actually don't actually mind when he takes me for a dance. 'Cause you know he's not gonna lay a finger on you. Well, true. Let's get back to it. We wouldn't want Stag to catch us slacking. Yeah. Later, Babe. Say it. Say it again. Belly button. Whisper it. Belly, button. Play with it while you say it. You like my belly button? I love it. Spit in it? Don't. Don't stop! Say it again. Belly, button. It's Kelly, right? Yeah, you need a drink? No, I don't drink but I don't want the customers to know so if anyone orders me anything can you just give me a club soda? Sure. It'll be our secret. Hey Roxy, got a sec? Sure. What's up? I just wanted to apologize about earlier, you know, about not having your back with Stag. Don't be silly. You're not mad at me? Of course not. Look, I got my problems with Stag but they're my problems, not yours. He still shouldn't have docked you. Look, I just wanna give you this, you know, to cover some of it. Put that away, I'm not taking your money. No it's okay, I'm having a good night. Like, really good. I'm glad, but I'm not taking it. You told me you're saving for college, right? That starts in what, two, three months? Three. Then you need it more than I do. You gotta get as far from here as possible, or next thing you know you'll end up like Crystal over there. You don't want that. No, I don't. Pretty bad ass, right? Wanna dance? Where's my foot, Bitch? But you're already.. All ready to shove it up your ass if you don't beat it. Fuckin' newbies.

Are you cock blocking me because I kissed you with cum lips? Roxy fucked up. Some dude grabbed her so she slugged him. And what do you want me to do about it? I told him I would get a girl to blow his mind. That's not what you want me to blow. Wait a minute. He's not fugly? You have standards suddenly? Yeah. Stag, it's Will. Come in. Hey listen, we had another incident with Roxy. Christ. What now? Customer grabbed her ass and she slugged him. You deal with it? I had Crystal give him a free dance. Good job, but nothing's free. That's coming out of Roxy's pay. Tell that bitch I wanna see her. Okay. What was I supposed to do? I warned him. I hate this place. I know I shouldn't have hit him back but.. Rox, Stag wants to see you, now. Why? Wait, you told him? Yeah, I had to. That guy you hit is a big spender. Jesus, Will! Stag's gonna tear me a new asshole! You should have thought of that. Why did you have to tell Stag? You girls have to get it through your heads. If you wanna work here, you're gonna get groped. End of story. Watch this. Come in. I know why I'm here and, I wanna apologize. It was just like a reflex. You just keep fuckin' up, don't you? Give me one good reason I shouldn't fire your ass right now.

Please don't fire me. Okay. I got an idea about that. This is my friend Vince and he's been working really hard lately. I wanna show him my appreciation. So why don't you get down on your knees, crawl over to him, and suck his cock? And when you're done with him, I want you to crawl over to me, and suck mine. You do that, and you can keep your job.

He'll kill both of us, you know that fucking bastard would do it. Stag has to pay for this. It's Alana's word against his. They never believe strippers. Well make them believe. You weren't there, Rox. He was crazy. Everybody knows he killed his wife and nothing happened. You think he can't get away with this? This is fucked up. Let's just get her out of here. We can talk more later. We'll take her back to my place. Scoot over, Honey. Why didn't you stop him? I didn't know what was going on. I wanted to go with her but they put me on stage. That fucking animal. Morning, Ma'am. Sheriff Buckman, you called about a sexual assault? This way. Oh, what the hell, Rox? I'm sorry, I had to. Wake up, Honey. No. It's all right. It's all right, I'm here to help. He'll kill me. Whoa whoa, who will kill you? Who did this? It was Lou Staglione. Everyone calls him "Stag". Yeah, I know who that is. What did he do? He raped her! Sorry, Miss, I'm gonna need to hear it from her. They raped me. They. Stag, and a friend of his, Vince. Stag I know. Who's Vince? Some scumbag who thinks he's the cock of the walk. He got a last name? No, we just call him Vince. This happen last night at the club? Yes. You girls dancers, yeah? What does that have to do with anything? Drinkin' last night? They made me! I don't mean for this to sound wrong, but, I gotta ask, you take money? What the fuck? I'm just tellin' you how it looks. You girls are drinkin', party and dress like, well, you know. No we don't. Why don't you tell us? You know, there is some in this town who might think she got exactly what she had coming. It's gonna be your word against his. You may want to take her to the hospital. Get rape kit done. Prove they had sex at least. Of course, he'll just say it was consensual. Does that look consensual to you? A good lawyer will convince the jury she hit herself, or asked to be hit. Thanks for nothing. Let this be a lesson. You might wanna think long and hard about your lifestyle choices. I can't believe that. I told you they wouldn't listen. If we're lucky, Stag doesn't hear about this and kill all of us. I think I'm gonna be sick. He can't get away with this, Rox. We gotta make him pay. What can we do about it? I have an idea. It's open. What the fuck were you thinkin'? I don't think I like your tone. I've cleaned up a lot of shit for you. God knows. I draw the line at rape. That girl you worked over, she called me. Her word against mine. Ever hear of DNA? She gets a rape kit done and her word, may look a darn sight better than you think. You can't make that go away? What am I paying you for? I'd have to bribe a doctor. A nurse or two, maybe someone in my own evidence locker. And since you like to keep souvenirs, I may have to bribe a judge and fuckin' jury, Stag. Is that all? Well why didn't you say so? Next time you rape a stripper, at least pick one that doesn't look like a fuckin' choir girl. I'll be keepin' these. Keep your nose clean, Stag. It's crazy. Is it? We know that place like the back of our hands. He'll kill us! Are you really okay with him getting away with this? Fuck no. That cop is not gonna do shit for us. He practically said that Alana deserved to be raped. I know, but.. We're the only ones who can make him pay. I don't mean to sound like a broken record but he'll kill us. Not if we do it right. We hit him hard and then we split. We're always talking about getting out. Our of the club, out of this town. It's just talk! It doesn't have to be. We could leave? Really? I don't think I could ever go back to that place. And no one could blame you. And Roxy, you're already fired. Don't remind me. I'm just saying we have nothing to lose. You think I wanna go back there knowing what he did? We hit him where it hurts. And what if he hits back? There's three of us and one of him. And then what? Split town? Look around, I can barely afford a bus ticket. He'll find us and kill us, like his wife. You said so yourself. Come on, you don't really believe that Bouncing Betty crap, do you? That's just a story they tell the new girls to keep them in line. She's probably a fat soccer mom somewhere cashing Stag's alimony checks. Even if you're right, we still can't afford to leave. We can if we get him to open that safe of his before we crack his head open. It keeps getting better. Why would he do that? And what makes you think there's anything in it? It's probably just for show like that workout bench he never uses. If this goes wrong, and there's no other way it can go, our lives won't be worth the few hundred bucks we get from that safe. There's more than a few hundred in there. A lot more. What? The safe is full of money. How'd you know that? After they were done with me, Stag opened it to pay me and it was full. Like, stacked to the top full. How much do you think? I don't know. Lots. He pulled three hundreds off a stack like this high. That sounds like a $10,000 stack. What? I wasn't always a stripper. I worked as a bank teller for a while. $10,000 split three ways is a little more than a bus ticket.

It's not too late to back out. Crystal and I can take it from here. Giving you your share before we leave. God knows you earned it. No. I need to do this. I'm so sick of being the victim. The first time a man hit me, do you know what I said? "Sorry." I said I was sorry like it was my fault. When my parents found out, they were furious. With me, not with him. Dad kicked me out of the house when I got pregnant. Because a deacon's daughter isn't supposed to have sex. Mom at least drove me out of town. With a stop at the clinic for a good measure, and the whole time, all I could say was sorry. Well, after tonight, you'll never have to be sorry again. After... After Stag raped me, he said that no one cared about me. But that's not true. You care about me. And Crystal cares about me. That's right. We gotta stick together. It's the only way any of us survive. First place I worked at, I wasn't much older than you. There's this manager who treated the girls like they were his harem. Did he... It wasn't rape. Not really. But we knew if we didn't go along, we wouldn't get the shifts we wanted. What did you do? I didn't do anything. But there was this one girl, Maggie, who'd had enough. Maggie was the queen bee, you know the type. Doesn't take shit from anybody. But she had a passel of kids at home so she couldn't quit her job. So what did she do? One day she found me crying in the dressing room. Fucker had put his hands so far up my knickers, I bled. Now I know why you don't let them touch you. Mm-hm. So, Maggie looks at me and promises it'll never happen again. And then, she tells me, I wanna watch her stage show that night. Did you? Wouldn't have missed it. This manager liked to sit in gynecology row, I guess, get a good look, you know? He was there when Maggie's turn came up. She had one these heavy stilettos. Heels longer than most guys' peckers. She could really spin on that pole. Like Crystal? Better. When she hit him, she was spinning so fast I didn't see it. But I heard it. It sounded like a hammer pounding a nail. A couple days later we got a new manager. He wasn't a saint but never put his hands where they didn't belong. What happened to the old manager? He moved into a special facility. It was a tragic accident. Where's Maggie now? Still dancing? Retired? I don't know. I would feel a whole lot better about tonight if Maggie was with us. She is. It's open. What the fuck do you want? Can I have a minute? Beat it. It's my day off. I just wanna apologize. Beg for your job back, you mean. Would you accept a sincere, special type of apology? Yeah. I really need this job and, I'll do anything to get it back. Anything. Well I can only think of one thing. Oh thank you, Stag. You won't regret it. I even brought you a present. I know. I'm staring at them. Better. What's better than tits? Fuckin' A. You really do want your job back. All right, let's do it the right way. Climb up here. I should warn you, coke makes me aggressive. Oh, I hope so. I knew you'd come around, Roxy. If you're really good, I'll let you keep it. You fuckin' bitch! Did it work? Like a charm. Maybe you gave him too much. How was I supposed to know? He's not a horse. He's as heavy as one. I think I pulled something dragging him over here. Wake up, you son of a bitch. Stag? What are you doing here? Isn't it your night off? Um, yeah Stag called me in and um, I came to score some extra points for class. Better you than me. Put a stop on the door. If Will finds out you're here, he'll drag your ass into the VIP. Roxy got fired and no one's seen Alana in days. So we're short tonight. Okay, yeah! Uh, great. Thanks for the heads up, I better get back. Slut. That was close. I know. Give me your panties. What? Give me your panties. You know Stag always hangs panties on the door when he doesn't wanna be disturbed. Too cheap to fix the lock. Hurry up, before Will comes. So use your panties! I'm not wearing any. What the fuck is this? This is an intervention. You raped Alana and now we're gonna make you pay. Literally. Consider this the most expensive lap dance of your life. What are you talkin' about? I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Careful! You wouldn't want us getting any ideas. What is this shit? Here's how this is gonna work. You're gonna tell us the code to your safe.. The fuck I am. Aw, we thought you might say that. Alana, would you be so kind as to hand me the knife? You're bluffing. Are you sure? You don't have the balls. What did I say about giving us ideas? You! We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. You're gonna do it the dead way when I get out of this, Cunt. I hate that word. Not the lap dance you had in mind? You'll never get away with this. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. Either way you're fucked. Help! Help! Help me, somebody! Scream all you want. No one can hear you. Remember? Oh, Stag! Oh, Stag! Fuck me, Stag! Fuck me, Stag! The code. Now. The hard way. What the fuck is this? Alana has just tied a garret around your balls. I don't imagine that feels too pleasant. The other end, is fastened to the weight. When Crystal and I let go, you'll wanna hold on or, off with your balls. Ready? On three. One. Two. Three! Oh, good. I was afraid that would go horribly wrong. Let me explain the way this is gonna work. 50 pounds might not feel like much now but, soon your muscles will start to ache. Eventually you won't be able to hold it any longer and the weight will drop. When that happens, you can kiss your nuts goodbye. Did you know I grew up on a cattle ranch? I used to watch my daddy castrate the bulls. Not that different. Once you tell us the code, we'll cut the wire. I can hold onto this all night if I have to. We'll see. You don't mind if I use your private bathroom, do you, Honey? Go fuck yourself. Hey, Sheriff. Is Stag in tonight? He's in his office but... He's got one of the girls with him. So? He doesn't like to be disturbed. Yeah, I bet. Relax. It won't be much longer. Stag, we need to talk. Help me! What in God's name? They're crazy! Don't either of you fuckin' move! I've seen some crazy shit in my day, but I have never.. Oh my god, Crystal! Oh my god, oh my god. What have you done? I did what I had to do. Now maybe the son of a bitch will know we mean business. You killed him. I did, didn't I? No one was supposed to die. I had another choice? You killed a cop! We'll be charged with murder! Which carries the same amount of time as kidnapping which we absolutely would have gone down for if I hadn't killed him! I don't mean to sound cold but we don't have time for a wake. When the sheriff doesn't call in, they're gonna send someone to come looking for him. Fuck! All right, you sack of shit. Change of plans. Turns out we don't have all night, after all. You're gonna fry, Bitch. All of you. Last chance if you ever wanna learn the piano! Fuck you! No! Oh, god. Not my finger! There's a big boy! Wouldn't want you to bleed to death. Gonna have to cauterize it. I'll tell you! I'll fuckin' tell you! Come again? I'll fuckin' tell you, just don't burn me, you crazy bitch! Oh my god. What do we have here, huh? Oh, thank god. Thank god. Shoot him, Crystal! He raped me! What are you doing here? Oh, excuse me. I just came to see my girl. I'm not your girl. No, you're not. I am. What are you doing? On the couch. Come on. Sit on the couch, Princess. Do it! What are you doing? Sorry, Rox. I didn't plan it this way but you showed up when I was coming out with Alana and I figured you were just mad enough to go along with this. You had all this planned? You knew what they were gonna do to me? Listen, I know it sounds bad but, I needed another girl to do this. You had me raped so I would help you rob Stag? Why? I could think of a million reasons. Wait. Alana here was supposed to take the fall, wasn't she? You'd kill Stag and her and then split the money two ways? Clever girl. But if you move any closer to that cleaver, you're going to be a clever dead girl. Move away from it. Move away from it! Vince! Vince, Baby. Is he... Yeah. Cut his femoral artery. What do we do now? I don't know. Asshole! What do we do now, Roxy? Get the hell out of town. You won't get 20 miles without that money. That's 20 miles further than you. We were so close, weren't we? Take a look at this. What? What is it? Am I crazy or, or are a couple numbers more worn than the others? Yeah. The three and the eight. Mostly the three? Three and eight. Could it be? Here goes nothing. Oh my god. Oh my god! You did it. You did it, you did it, you did it! Hey, have you seen Stag? He's in his office. With Crystal. Crystal? What the fuck is she doing here? What do you think? Shit. I need you to do me a favor. Well what about me? This whole thing was my idea. You gotta be kidding. You were gonna have us killed and you expect a share? Well think about it. You need me to keep my mouth shut, right? You know what? I have a better way to keep your mouth shut. We never got to use this. Quit messing around, Alana. Oh, who's messing around? Come on! You had me raped, Crystal. Do you think I can just forget that? Jesus, Alana. Not like this. Stag, Will needs the keys to the cellar. You're the only one she knows is here. Answer her. Need me now, huh? What's in it for me? I won't blow your head off. And? All right! We'll cut you in. Find Stag's keys. Stag? Shit. I'm coming in, okay? No! No no no. Wait, wait wait. I can't find his keys, Rox! Don't do anything stupid. Jesus, Crystal! Are you okay? Oh, this? It's nothing. Did Stag... Hit me? No, he tried to lift me and I guess he's not as strong as he thought. Are you sure you don't need help? Help? Help spending all the money the guilty bastard's throwing my way. Probably afraid I'm gonna sue him. Anyway, I need to get back in there. Here are the keys. I won't be much longer and then, drinks on me. All clear? Yeah, but we better hurry. Thanks to Mohammed Ali over here, Shelby thinks Stag is using me as a punching bag. She'll probably be back. Maybe with Will. We'll go back to my place. Split the money, then I'm getting the hell out of dodge. Can I come with you? Sure. Aw, isn't that sweet. But what about me? I don't have a car. I'll call you a cab. Fuck a cab. I'm going out in style. You said Crystal was here. Uh-huh. Then where the fuck is she? I, I don't... That bitch. That fucking bitch. I'll go get some bags. Don't forget my ride. Your ride's outside. Let's blow this shit hole. That's what I'm talkin' about. Alana... Later, Bitches! She'll make it look like Crystal pulled the whole thing off and then Vince's people got to her.
