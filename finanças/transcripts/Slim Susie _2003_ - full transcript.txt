Itwasn'tme. I didn't do it. Please! I can explain everything. Itwasn'tme. I've gotto start atthe beginning for you to understand. Okay. Itbegan in Stockholm yesterdaymorning. Open up! I'man Independent publlsher. I've only really publlshed one book, so far. Whlch I wrote myself. - Erik Sv?rd Publishing. - HI, it's Sandra from home. Withthe red halr, except it's black now. SIImSusle's gone. She's been gone a week. You haven't heard from her?. SIImSusle Is my little slster back home. She's very proper. Writes Chrlstmas cards In September. Very uptlght. Stupidfucking pencil! Whatwas she like when you last sawher? Well, she was... - Go on. - I hitchhiked home to find her. Nothlng had changed Inthree years. When I leftthree years ago, the klosk glrlwas knocked up. Thlngs do go slowly Inthe country. I knew my slster had moved, but itwas only 200 yards. I hadto leave her behlnd. I couldn'ttake it. The last straw came on a Sunday, atthe weekly movle. The movles came just about whenthey were released on vldeo. Butwith a lot more scratches. Yeah, the movie ran out. Theyforgot the lastreel. Which sucks. But I'IItryto sortit out. Hi, it's me. Fine, and you? You've seen Pulp Flctlon, right? So, howdoes it end? Oh, really? That seems confusing. What happens to the colored guy? Well, I'm sorryto have to tellyou this, but... John Travolta dies coming out ofthe bathroom. - He does? - Bruce Willis shoots him. - The colored guy does fine. - Good. It's notmyfault. It's Stockholm's. Butnowyou can do things athome. You can rake leaves, or something. Thanks, bye. - Where are you going? - Where they don't showhalfa movie. - Stockholm. - Do Itake care ofMom alone? - Iwantto go too. - It's too dangerous. It's full ofjunkies who jab people with syringes justfor fun. - It's too rough for you. - It's rough here, too. I'll die ifyou move! You asshole. Susie! I can't cometothe baptlsm. My VCRIs busted andthere's a game on. Is my sister home? Tore Tumor. Knownforthetumor he usedto have In hls head. Afterthe operatlon he couldn't speak. Whlch caused problems. Llke when he got hls penslon papers Inthe mall. He dldn't understandthe numbers. Just lots ofzeros everywhere. Torethoughtthatwas unfalr. That's Tore for you. Had a kld Thatmeans we're familynow, Tore. My slsterwasn'tthe mother. She dldn't even Ilve In the apartment, but next door. Shut upl Baby sleeplng I flgured mom mlght know somethlng about Susle. It seemed Ilkely, at least. Erik! Hownice! Do you want cookies? You! Don't standthere sneering. Think you're some big shot. Justbecause you have a company. My son runs a companyin Stockholm. And yours? Do you knowwhere Susie is? She dldn't know. She was busy with her booze. See my gorgeous daughter. I signed her up for the Miss Motor pageant. She's goingto win. Mlck Thlrteen. The most Inept pettythleflnthe county. Or just very unlucky, I don't know. Llkethetlme he got out ofjall- - and found outthat he'd Inherited 100 grand. Andthe wrong car stopped. A stock broker. Third generation networks are a good bet. Butfor blue chips, telecom is the thingto go for. Really? Telecom? Grits' answering service. You're in line. We'IItake your call later, or you can leave a message. - Who was it? - Some guy. Not Billy? He's so easilyriled. You're notfilming, are you? No, no, no. - Hiss it: "I'm sixteen". - I'm sixteen. Now, tryfourteen. Are there no normal people here? There's lots ofnormal people. Everywhere. There's not much totellaboutthem. Gunnar, setthe alarm 15 minutes early so I can blowdrymyhair. Good night. The onlythlng withthesetwo Is that he's jealous. So, he's sewn shrlmp Into her pants. You setitto 15 minutes earlier, right? It's important, to give me time to blowdrymyhair. There's onethlng I cantellabout her. Can you hear what I'm saying? No? Good. Ljustneedto talk. No one listens to what I have to say. It's justtoo nerve-wracking. There's so much noise. I need silence. When you're in the womb, before you're born, it's all quiet. Andwhen you die, I suppose it's quiettoo. Between the two, it's justnoisy and I can'ttake that. That's all Iwantedto say. Thank you. Itrledto flnd Sandra, the glrlwho'd called. All I knewwas that she was cute and had some last name. Not a lot oflnformatlon, really. I was sadthat my plzza "Erlk's Extra Everythlng"was gone. - Hi, Erik. - Hi. It's me, Susie's friend Sandra with the piercing and red hair. - Except Itookit out andwentblack. - Hi. It had beenforetoldthat Sandra's love would be a latlno man. She was supposedto meet hlm In an elevator. Butthe fortune-teller hadn't sald whlch elevator. There's two ofthem Intown. Elevators, that Is. Can I get something on tab? Acalzone and a schnapps? Erik, isn'titfucking oddthat no one's seen Susie for a week? No one's seen her since she paid her tab on Sunday. Tab? Susie was never in debt. - She kept a household budget. - She usedto, butnotnow. She ate the same pizza, morning, noon and nightfor three months. - Pizza? She was such a health freak. - Health freak? So, what do the police say? Well, I guess you can say... Didn'tyou use to have red hair? BIIly Davldson, the sole cop Intown. A Stockholm natlve sent here agalnst hls wlll. Well, I guess you can say... Could you getrid ofthatflythere? Itjustlooks disgusting. I guess you can say thatthese things happen. Things disappear. People disappear. - Maybe she walkedthe dog? - She doesn'thave a dog. Howwould I know? Dogs get borrowed, people dog-sit. Yeah... You shouldn't offend me. We should avoid offence in this town. Can'tyou tellwhatit's like? Paper, paper, paper. I'm choking on paperwork. Break-in, nursing home medicine cabinet. Naked man in the supermarket. Moose hunting in town. See? I'm drowning in paperwork. But I do get some tip-offs. Ever heard ofKeyser Soze andTony Montana? - No... - Nope. They're notmentioned in any police files. Howfar do these reach? 100 yards? I have no one to talkto anyway. It's 40 miles to the nearest... And look atthis. Four minutes oftalktime, then the battery goes. And ittakes two days to charge the fucker. I'm ashamed. I sithere in shame. That's howitis. That's mylot, to sithere in shame. Susie wouldn'tjust go. She's damned reliable. She's notthe Susie you think. She'd never have dated Grits. - Grits? - Yeah. Butitwas a mess. She was in love with someone else. Erik? Grits and I wentto school together. We dld a lot. Collected Star Wars flgures, put rocks onthetracks- - rented movles and opened ourflrst beertogether, But he also ran Into the drlvlng Instructors car- - when he was gettlng hls blke Ilcense. Erik! Goodto see you. We're making a movie. Come in. Hey, Grits. Are you and Susie... No one cleans up around here. Thatjust sucks. Have a beer. - Beer smells great. - Who are these guys? Good guys, working class. Notthattheyhave jobs. So, just good guys. We've had a two-day Scarface conference. That's whythey're wasted. We did allthe lines. We triedto emailthe guywho made the movie, which was hard. The connection just sucks. Shoot! Shootme. Yeah, there you go. Grits really loves movles. We've made 50 movles together. 2,5 mlnutes, no sound. "Deadly Murder"was probablythe best one. THE END Itwas notthat bad. - Morning beer smell rules. - Why am lfilming? For a documentary aboutme, to leave something behind. I'll die one day, like everyone does. - Are you working? - Don'thave the time. Sit down. Don'tyou wantthis one? Yeah, it's Grits. Right. Yeah. Hey, what are you on? Can you getme some? - Screwthat. - Who was that? - No clue. - So, are you dating Susie? Damn it, the laundry. Nope, never dated Slim Susie. Notthat I noticed. - Cutit out! Yes or no? - Naw. She'd sleep here sometimes. She'd bring a pillow. I never touched her, not someone's little sister. I swear. Haven't seen her for a while. - She's disappeared. - Well, that explains it. Whatwas she like lasttime you sawher? - Drunk and unhappy. - Why? - Too much to drink, I guess. - Cutit out! I'm worried! Whywas she unhappy? It happened atthe openlng ofthe sports hall. The Chlmp from Electrlc Banana Band was there. Afterthe openlng he split, and left her alone. Screwed up with love and memorles. For a whlle shethoughtwas pregnant by hlm, but she wasn't. Itwas probably justthe plzza. Sandral lfanythlng happens to me, look Inthe draln plpes. Why didn't she tell me? Yeah, why didn't she? What a crappy sister. Siblings stayin touch. I've got somethingto comfortus. Vino Shito, rlghtfrom hell. It's orange flavored. - I have a sieve... Ah, screwit. - Who uses this? You can add other stufffor flavor, pizza crust, pepperoni... - None for me. - You drain the bacteria culture... - Why'd you tellthat? Makes me sick. - It's important. You need allthe details to knowl'm innocent. Lfyou're lying, Iwill be sorelyvexed. When I get sorelyvexed, I getreallymean. - You're lying! - No. - It's true. - Good. Go on. Settle down! I've got something awesome to showyou. - We'IItake the Humpmobile. - I'm goingto the cops. - My awesome thingfirst. - Does no one care that she's gone? Firstthe awesome thing. Then we care. - Butyou've been drinking. - Let's go. I can bullshitthe cops, or anyone else. Yeah, I can. - Getin. Itfeels kinda American now. They call it Little Chicago. Or Very Little Chicago. I don'tremember. Here's something mega-awesome. Somethingto survive crappy days. Checkit out. Avideo store. Awesome. Gerd! Get outhere. Look who Ifound. You're back. Didn't do well in Stockholm? - I did great, but Susie's gone. - No wonder, with her lifestyle. - Whatkind of"lifestyle"? - Ignore her. She's annoyed, 'cause she got arrestedfor assault. Checkthis. Amovie aboutme, "Grits Nr. 1". I'm working on the sequel. Fewgetto star in their own movie without screwing someone. There's a powerful scene where I almost die, choking on dinner. - Real scary. Rentit. - Well, that does sound interesting. Hardfuckingwork, too. You don'tjust shoot. Everything has to be right. Light, sound... Action. Shutup. Damn... Answer it! It's that damned German again. He's stalking me. Hey! There's an awesome scene where... Closed. For emergencles, callthe pollce. You need a ride somewhere? Fuck. I knewwhere BIIly Davldson Ilved. He mlght stlll have my souped-up moped. Hey! Look what Ifound in the glove compartment! Moonshine! Grits has always been Ilke a turd. A floaterthatwon'tflush. Fuck. No one ever fills up the car. Damn it, Grits! You're supposedto steer it! Shit. The bad luck won't end. Poor Grits, havlngto dotlme for drunk drlvlng. But I felt itwas probably the bestthlngfor hlm. - Quick coffee? - Yeah. That's awful decent ofyou. I don'tknowwhatto say. I guess we could organize a search party. It seems sort ofearly, and I have a fewdays off. Overtime compensation that I'd like to use. - Is she dead? - I doubtit. I mean... She could be, but I doubtit. Why? Has she been ill? - No. - That's whythe search partyis off. Normally, I'm spontaneous and quite likelyto organize searches. Howlong has she been gone? What dayis today? Wantmilk? The wife demanded a porch, or she'd leave him. They've been on the rocks for a while. Howdo I know? She visits for a humping sometimes. Cops'wives are like everyone. Here's a coconut cookie. The wife made them, with coconut. Guess what? Mom thinks dad is bad in bed. She said so on the phone. But I can teach you to make the bed, daddy. Have a coconutthing... Cutit out! You should be looking for Susie, not offering cookies! Uffe, turn it off. I've told you notto ride around on seized property. - Parkit. It's notyours. - Buthe gotitfor his birthday. Go in andtell mommy you have to go to the bathroom. You can take it. Itwas your moped, right? You can take itlater. The matter is settled. - What are you thinking about? - Billy Davidson. No real cop would behave thatway. He knows something about Susie. He's just overworked. Cops have a damned hard job to do. Justbe happy you gotyour moped back. I'd rather have my sister back. Don'tworry. I'IItellyou a story from mylife. It's similar to this. But I have to do itin English, or I'll startbawling. I don'twantto do that. - There you go. - Who do you thinkitbelongs to? - Fix the potatoes, Gunnar. - That's notmything. For God's sake. You knowhowto lift a pan. Jeez. Those are good potatoes, King Edward. Oh, my God... Grits's answerlng servlce. - That's Davidson's wife. - Yeah. - Howdisgusting. - Yeah. - Really, Gunnar. Turn offthatfilth. - Yeah. Stop making noise, or I'll callthe police! I knowthe policeman, and he knows Gunnar and mymother too. Thatmightworkin Stockholm, butin V?rmlandwe want quiet. There mightnotbe a lawon the books, butthere's an unwritten one- - aboutnotmaking noise and respecting people. I'm glad you turned it off. It's notthatyou're a bad person. I over-reacted. Ljusthadto vent. Thank you for listening. I'm tired ofyour made-up buffoons. Just admityour guilt. No. There were many people involved. They're too weird. Most crimes are committed bynormalfolks. - They're normal ordinary people. - Normal? Imagine Saturdaynighthere, with allthese people. - Thatwas interesting. - That's abouthowitis. Trythatin court. I'm sure it'll go over well. Go on. You slept atthe pizza girl's house. Erik, Ithink Susie's dead, and a lot ofpeople knowit. Even Davidson. A whlle back, I saw somethlng welrd Inthe vldeo store. - Alot oftalking in this one? - Hardly any. I'IItake it, then. Putthat away. - Can I have a bag ofcandy? - Sure. Some for the kids, too. Lfhe can be boughtwith a B-movie and some candy- - he's cheap. Lfshe's been killed, he knows who did it. And someone gave him candy to keep his mouth shut? Damn it, I can't sleep! Two other people were sleepless. Tore Tumor and hls baby. The baby had collc every nlght, andthe mother had left- - after havlng read somethlng about equality. Sandral lfanythlng happens to me, look Inthe draln plpes. Howoften did you see Susie before she disappeared? Occasionally. She'd just gotten so weird. She justwanted... ...cash andto talk aboutThe Chimp. - What Chimp? - What're you making? - Disco powder. - Disco powder? - Nowl'm really getting spaced out. - Don'tworry, it'll pass. - I'm back. - It's starting again. - What's with thatpowder? Lfthings are so boring, why don'tyou move? I'd rather be a duckyin a pond than in the ocean. Wow, well said. Thatwas reallywell said! - Yeah, itwas. - I have to write it down. - Yeah, you do that. - I shouldwrite a book. Abook aboutmyself. Bridge to the chorus... This is just so good. - No, it sucks. - Whatever. It's a free country. Hey, Susie. Make the book about a girl drugging her brains out. - Hello, Susie. Can I ask something? - Go ahead. This dump has the lowest educational level in the country. Howdo you feel aboutthat? It's notbad, actually. Makes it easyto be smart. - Butyou don't seem smart. - Exactly. But I am. Ljustpretendto be dumb. Here in the countryside, you're supposedto be... ...justplain happy and dumb. - What? Was she doing drugs? - Yeah. Didn'tyou know? Ithoughtyou knew. - Where'd she get drugs from? - From work. The nursing home. - More. - One more time? - You needto paythe jukebox. - Here you go. - Itriedto gether to quit. - Why'd she even start? - Ljust don't getit. - I should've called you much earlier. She kind oflooked up to you. Alot, actually. - Who, me? - She missed you. Grits gother started. In the grocery store, ofall places. She was hardly eatlng at all atthat polnt. But she hadto care for your mom, too. So when mom made a foolof herselfforthe umpteenthtlme... You can'tjustfire me! There are laws even here! I've worked here longer than anyone! I onlyhad cough syrup, that's notillegal. Iwantmy job back! - Go get Ralph! - Settle down, now. The customers wantpeople like me, you goddamnedfascist! Are you sad? I knowwhatthat's like. I've probablybeen sadder than anyone in the county. See? 27 and bald. Nottoo rockin'. I looklike some gym teacher. You can'tbe too sensitive. You have to find a wayto persevere. Just act dumb. Then people will leave you alone. Checkthis out. Brown sugar. Smoking smack. - What? - It's a prescription against sadness. Or baldness. Wanna tryit? - She's not dead, you know. - Yeah, let's decide that. Good. Positive thinking. Let's talk about something normal. Something normal? I had a huge crush on you when you lived here. Really? Well, I certainly didn'tnotice. - Iwas pretty popular. - Susie said you were a virgin. - No, no... - She said so. Ithought I'dfuck myselfto death, butitworked out. Guess what? I had myfortune told a while ago. The fortune-teller said I'd meet someone from another culture. But I don'tknowanylanguages. Maybe itwas you. Does Stockholm count, you think? I don'tknow... - Hey. I actually dreamed aboutyou. - Aboutme? Lots oftimes. But I've stopped doingthat. It doesn'tleadto anything. That's whathappens when you do ittoo much. - Whatwas that? - Acrow? That nlght, I dreamed ofmy little slster. Someone, please help me. Someone, please help me. Grits! - Come in. Movie's just starting. - You'd better help me, Grits! Help you? Have a problem? Got somethingto sell? Screwit. Come on in. - There are four junkies in there! - Justthe four? It should be packed. We're having Kubrick night. - They're always full. - Ithink Susie's dead. I borrowed a tape of Clockwork Orange backwards. The entire movie. We look for hidden messages. There one scene where it sounds like he's speaking Swedish. Imagine that. Alex speaking Swedish. She died, like in my dream. You have to tell me whatyou know. - Cutit out. You could die. - Well, so could you. He dldtryto quit sometlmes. Lasttlme was three years ago, when I left. - Erik? Do you think I'm an idiot? - Naw, it's cool. Thank you. My parole officer was impressed that I'm not a mean drunk. Then he said Iwas enough ofa loser to be drunk forever. - What do you say? - Trybeing sober for a while. Sober? Ithink I'IItrythat. Seriously. Never take any drugs ever again. Ithink you can reach your goals. - As long as you have a vision. - So, whatis your goal? It doesn'treallymatter. Get on welfare, maybe. Hardthese days. As long as you have dreams. I knowthis guywho claims unemployment. Part ofthe system. He's had a house and a wife. That's goingto be me. Happy. What? It's low-alcohol beer. Okay... - Who killed my sister? - You're riled up. - We've gotto catch this on film. - Who killed my sister? - Damn camera... - Do you knowwho killed Susie? Itwasn'tme. Or anyone else. Where's the camera? Hello? Ithink we've alreadyhad this conversation. - Do you knowGerman? - No. Damned German, calling allthe time. He's stalking me. What's this? - Aregular Makarov. - Whathave you used itfor? Itookitfrom Tore. He gotitto shootyou when you were breaking in. Iwas kind enough to take it. Tore ain'ttoo bright. Hey, it's me. Yeah. He understands. Stop writing me! We will never go bananas together! Signed, Claes the Chimp. Someone, please help me. She was so happy when she won the Mlss Motor pageant. It's a pretty nlce contest. The neighbors called. I'm technically off, but... - They said a druggie was breaking in. - I've seen nothing. - How'd you getin? - The unlocked door. - Been fighting? - Iwouldn'thurtmy sister. Back off. There are even people who murder themselves. You don't get a free pass justbecause you're siblings. - There's a hole here! - Talkto the landlord. - It could be a bullethole. - It's a hole, nothing more. Tidy up in here, and go backto Stockholm. I can'treally guarantee your safety anymore. And I don'twantto catch you here in town again. Damn it. And I don'twantto catch you here in town again. Wait! Are you okay, Thirteen? Mlck Thlrteen always treated me well. I gotto sit on hls shoulders whenthere was a crowd. Itwas Papa Dee. He'd gotten dlrt In hls carburetor. - Whatbastard didthis to you? - I did itmyself. Yourself? Lfelt so guilty, ljustwantedto die. It's about Slim Susie. I should just start atthe beginning. Susle and Blow Dryer Woman work atthe nurslng home. - What's that smell? - It's crab, I'm sure. - Ignore it, andwork. - I'm exhausted. - Ithappens. - Hey. Did you do get a hair cut? No. I've justblowdried it, I getup a bit earlier to have the time. - That's clever. - Yes, it's practical. I'm sorry. I didn'tmean that about cutting your hair. And now, dear, you'll have a freshlymade bed. - Shouldwe wake her? - No, she's goingto sleep anyway. You knowwhat? Ithink she died. She's not alive now, anyway. So, anyway... BlowDryer Woman found a strongbox ofmoney. While theywere cleaning up. Something's happened. Ifound moneyin the wardrobe. And Iwas thinking. We should share it, Susie. We've helped Mary a great deal, and there's no needto tellthe others. And lfeltthat... Because I like you so much... ...Iwantedto share itwith you. - Okay. Let's see. There's about 20000, so that's 10000 each. Justbetween you and me, you know? There. Debt all repayed. - Payme interesttoo. - But I have a pizza tab. Stop it. - Willyou stop it, already? - The money. Never! - Fuck. - The money! - Who'd you getitfrom? - Gudrun, the blowdryer crab woman. - She found 20 grand, and I gothalf. - Half? Are you sure? - Trust only yourself, Susie. - No thanks. I'm quitting. I've heardthatbefore. Now, go watch the movie. Gerd Johanson, the blggest drug dealer Inthe county. Once a month she goes to Oslo and gets as much as she can. A lot. Then she adds a zero onthe end as markup. She never does any ofit herself. Except a jolnt, at partles. Watch out. Do something. You've reached Ninja status. Use a throwing star, or somersault. - Or a spear. - Or make him vanish in a puff. What's that crab smellingwoman called? Which movie? This one's all Hong Kong guys. - Gudrun. - Right. She's wearing a fur. She screwed you, Susie. Thatfur is worth more than 10000. The hag has more money, and Ithink you deserve it. There is absolutelyno risk in stealing stolen money. - Really? - Especiallyifit's from a non-biker. - I've never seen her on a motor bike. - No, just a bicycle. - Ithink she keeps the cash athome. - You do? You don'tputitin an account ifit's stolen. - You take charge, Susie. - Okay. Howmuch can an oldwoman have saved up? Halfa million? Damn! Tore Immedlately ordered an upscale baby carrlage. BABYSITTER WANTED Tore hadn't sleptforweeks, and looked forwardto a normal Ilfe. He was exhausted. I wasn'tthe only one spendlng In advance. Gerd dldn't dothe jobs. But she stllldemanded halfthe money. There's rumors about her. Some say she's a man. Orthat she's not really 43. I don't know. Rumors always fly about the wealthy Inthls country. - I heard you got some newmovies. - Newmovies? Yeah. Watch this one. Quite a simple story. Awoman is robbed ofmoney she's stolen from an estate. An estate? And after that? Some yahoos breakin and stealthe money. - What aboutthe police? - She doesn't contactthem. And ifshe were to, the cops wouldn't do a thing. Sounds good, I'IItake it. And some candy-for the kids too. - And some for mybrother. - Go ahead. So Susie organizedthe heist against BlowDryer Woman. Quite impressive. Mick. You distract Gudrun going home for lunch atten oftwelve. - You mean 11.50. - Right. Grits, you take her husband. He bikes at quarter oftwelve. - That's 11.45, Grits. - Howdo you mean "distract"? - So he doesn'tmake itto lunch. - OK, that's no problem at all. - I'Iljustthump him. - No, none ofthat. And you keep guard outside. - Doesn'the get a time? - No. Lfsomething happens, toss a bottle through the window. - Like a Bat Signal. - Stop smoking. Itfucks your mind. I've been smokingfor ten years, and haven'tnoticed anything. I'll showyou. Holdthis. That's notbad. The blg day came, and Blow Dryer Woman was chatty. Shetold Susle she'd quit and was gettlng a dlvorce. - Whathappened? - Going home yesterday... I heard a powerful song on the radio, and I'd justhad enough. - Knowwhat I mean? - Yes. I don'tknowwho was singing. The lyrics went something like this... Wantto hear? Don'tthink me silly, butit's great. It's meant a lotto me. Here goes... I mean it. Gunnar will have to gethimselfa newmaid. That's Girl Power. Go home andtell him. Yeah, Girl Power. Iwill. Whatthe hell is this? I handled my end perfectly. Who parked this brown car here? Hello? But Grits wasn'tthere to stop her husband, Gunnar. Grits had been so scared ofoversleeplng- - that he'd rented the longest DVD-box he could flnd. Hello? I can'ttalk. I'm watchingthis really deep movie. The Catalogue, by some Polack. Kieslowski. Nine hours. Susle knewthe money would be wherethe husband wouldn't look. Damn... What's for lunch? Gudrun? Are we having pork pancakes? What are you doing? I'm starving! Where are you? I need mylunch. Alright, I'll eat at the burger stand. No problem. God damn it. It didn'tmean to. Lfell asleep. I had a partyfor this little guy. - Theymusthave spiked my drink. - With alcohol, maybe? - Could be. - Shutup. -Howmuch was it? What? This is 2000. Whyis she getting some? - He. - She wasn'tpart ofit. - Neither were you. - He's a boy. - Is this all ofit? - Yes, Gerd. - It's not enough for a carriage. - You're talking. Tore was countlng onthe Insurance. So he pretendedto be braln damaged afterthe operatlon. - What a Jesus moment. - Did Jesus talk a lot? I'm out. I don'twantto see you anymore. See you in mybook. - Is it done? - Two minutes. I'm leaving. Wantto come? We could live together. Don'tknow. I kind oflike ithere. Kind of. Kind of... She's just chicken. - What? - Nothing. Lfsomething happens, ifl don't go, call mybrother in Stockholm. I'm sure he cares a bit abouthis sister. Why don'tyou call him right away? You thinkhe wants to see me like this? - In this one? - Yeah, unfortunately. Sorry. Well, goodbye. Hey! Sandral lfanythlng happens to me, look Inthe draln plpes. Andthen? Then she wenthome and gotinto the tub. - Where's the money?! - God damn it, Tore! - Alright. We'Iljustleave. - This is for real! - I'm tryingto solve it. - We can'tjustleave. She had a gun. Itwas totally selfdefense. Agun in the bath? Are you nuts? - We'll sayTore killed her to death. - That stinks. Howaboutthis? We write a suicide note. - She couldn'ttake it, and... - You goddamned moron! Tellthe police itwas an accident. Theywouldn't getit. They're just so damned suspicious. Don'ttrustpeople. Gerd went batshit when she heard about Susle. She ordered us to move the bodyto...somewhere else. Whatthe... - Who tookthe body? - I have no clue. - It's justweird. - It's all myfault. Thlrteen Is snitchlng. There's more money. Don'tworry, Erik. Puke allyou want. I'll clean itup later. Nothingto worry about. There. You sitin the front. - Come on. We're class mates. - You didn't come to the reunion. You upset everyone. I'd made a killer punch. - Butthatwas two years ago. - That's nothing. - I'm puttingthe baby seathere. - You can'tbringthe kid. You drive, Mick. - Howmuch do you know? - Aboutwhat? - Like us shooting Susie. - Are you slow, or something? - I have somethingto tell. - What's in the bag? What smells? It's crab, butnevermind.

You needto stand a little closer. Or you'll have to speak up. I can hold it. I boughtthese with stolen money. Ablowdryer and a fur coat. Itookthe moneyfrom an estate. I'm fully preparedto do mytime. Ithought I needed to change my Ilfe. That can be quite costly. I booked a trlp I haven't pald for yet. I justwantedto get out ofthls mess. Ouch. You can leave a message atthetone. - Oh, hello... - God damn you. - You were in my apartment. - No, Iwasn't. This was in mykitchen. No one else writes love letters to The Chimp. Pull, you stinking little brat. - Open up, Susie! - Damn. Open the door, Susie. I should have splitthe moneywith you. I'm sorry aboutthat. I don'tknow whathappened. Nowlwantto. - Where are they? - I'm sure you know. I needthe moneymore than you. I'm starting a newlife in Stockholm. You're notthe onlywho wants a newlife. You're all set. You're a youth. Pretty, slim and attractive. I deserve the money, too. 22 years I spent atthe nursing home.
