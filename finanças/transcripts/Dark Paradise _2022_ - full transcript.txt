When others were still riding bicycles, Martin was on a motorcycle. When others were on motorcycles, Martin had a Mercedes-Benz. The irony of destiny is that... it was Martin's strong heart that failed him and took him away from us. What are you on about? Shut up! Fucking retard. Take it easy. - Shut up! The path lit by a pilot beacon. A faint red glow now gone from the skies. Thus I lost my only guiding light. My soul desperately cries. Farewell, daddy. Whose boy is that Viktor again? Knowing Martin... maybe he's mine? Fuck, why do all the good ones die? So how big were his debts then? Five grand to me, ten to Paavo. - Ten, yeah. I don't have that kind of money. I have never seen that money. And don't drink any more today. Listen to what I tell you. - Yes. Don't be a stranger, come and visit. You and Viktor are the only ones I have left of Martin. Martin... Dad once promised me that motorcycle. What are you talking about? Hey, you're already after his stuff. What about the vest? What vest? Take the vest and get going. Viktor, it's time to go. I don't want to leave. Sven will give us a lift. I want to stay. What will you do here, among strangers? Dad isn't a stranger. This is not your home. Let him stay. He's family too. Alright. But you're taking the last minibus home. Maybe his eyes were still open. Looking out of this window. Is that your new bodyguard? What fucking bodyguard? Sven? Life goes on. - Mom, it's dad's funeral. Sven wanted to come. He's very supportive. How long has he been supporting you? You know... You should do something with your life. You're not daddy's little princess anymore. Daddy's gone. Who's gonna give you money now? You have to get a job. - Yeah? Like you? - Yes, like me. Okay, I'll try to find myself a job in a nail spa working four hours a week like you. We have to sell the Mercedes. - Forget it. Daddy gave it to me. - Oh? Daddy gave it to you? - Yes. Daddy gave it to you... Your daddy lied to us and had a bunch of debts. We have to sell the house. - Shut up, you don't know anything. Daddy gave it to me. Your father was nonstop drunk these past two years. You stopped by and thought daddy just had another nice party. But daddy had one neverending party all the time. Why didn't you say anything? What? You're exactly the same. What do you mean? How am I the same? Give me the car keys. - How am I the same? Give me the car keys. Give me the keys to the Mercedes! What are you looking at? Don't start... - Hey, come talk to the guys. Why don't you introduce yourself. Viktor. Martin was my father. Seriously? - The man got around a lot! Fuck me... Our condolences. This one can't drive. - She'll learn. KARMEN: ARE YOU COMING RIINA: TO YOUR DAD'S HOUSE? KARMEN: THE WAKE'S STILL ON TAKE A TAXI RIINA: WON'T IT BE STRANGE? KARMEN: BRING TOLIK'S SHIT Come out. Open the door! People are staring at you, through the window. I'm staring at you too, through the window. Do you think this is easy for me? Look at what you're wearing! I wanted to die of shame at the funeral. Please, let's go. Let's go to the hotel. We will clean up tomorrow. Fuck you! Get the fuck out of here! Let's go! Tomorrow. Hey, about the motorcycle. Does it still work? What will you do with it? Dear God. This will all be sold! Hello! Fuck you! What's wrong with you? All done? Show us! Wow! Beautiful. Is he still there? What's he doing? Drinking beer. I don't know. He's weird. I wish he'd leave... Did you get the G? From Tolik? Viktor! Hey, don't start... Viktor! Viktor! Viktor, hey! Come here. Did daddy ever have you baptized? No. Do you want to become a person? Come here! We're going to make Viktor a man. A baptism ritual. It all starts with G. Once! Twice! And the third time! Ladies, ladies... It's okay... Viktor! Where are your things? Over there. Everything's okay. Step in here. Very good, the other leg too. Look, there's two grand. For a thousand, get your face fixed. For the other thousand... don't tell anyone what happened, okay? Go to the doctor, have them take that shit off with a laser. You get it, don't you? The girl's father just died. They were very close. He was my father, too. Listen, there's the first aid kit. There should be some bandages. And tell your Grandma that... I don't know... you fell headlong through the greenhouse window. And can't remember anything. ♪ Sleeping sound, ♪ ♪ the horizon spreads with the sun, ♪ ♪ I can't stop thinking of you. ♪ ♪ All that is good is ♪ ♪ right here, right now. ♪ ♪ The dark night tempts us, ♪ ♪ don't hesitate, ♪ ♪ the wind will carry us. ♪ ♪ It's waiting for the two of us... ♪ Hi! - Hello. What's going on? I don't know, Karmen wanted something for the soul. Is that a good idea? Let her be. I have to breathe. That's the only way I can pass through. Without one dance shoe I heave myself up again. The door of closing doors is opening. The walls kept falling over me. Hey! What's up? I can smell pussy! I press my eye against the cave where Satan lies. A deity comes out my other eye. You see me looking, but not where. You try to deny me. But your affirmation is there. You want me to strangle you? What? Is this some kind of grief thing? Do you have to leave? I don't sleep at others' places. You sleep in hotels. - That's different. I own that space there. I've paid for it. Last time I remember we talked about how you should expand on the... Wait, let me see. You've actually done a good job of expounding on the problem... It's just that... it remains a bit unclear to me what is the purpose of all this? Do you understand where I'm going with this? I know what happened in your family. It must be hard for you. Don't worry too much about the thesis right now. I'll talk to the department chair. Okay. You know, you should talk to someone. Sitting around like that between four walls... you do have your father's genes after all. What are you trying to say? I'm just expressing my concern. That maybe you need to talk to someone. I don't know, it's all... just so... Sven and I were discussing that you should see a therapist. That would be for the best. Sven can pay for it too. Hello? Yeah, great idea. Very good. Yes and everything will be fine. And another thing ― you have to sign the waiver of inheritance. Yes. Seriously, or we'll have to deal with all of Martin's debts. Okay, bye then and take care! We're a bit busy here, so much to do. Sven and I are renovating the apartment. You are moving in with Sven? Hey, Viktor, did you have your face done? Look at that guy! What a dick. Jesus, fucking Christ! That's... quite ugly. What happened to you? I was attacked. There is nothing we can do right now. The wounds are too fresh. How long do I have to leave them on for? At least a few months. Then perhaps we can do something. At least two months for sure. Unbelievable... Is the boy with you again? Where else? He's always hanging around here. Send him home, food is getting cold. Hey, Viktor! Viktor, come here. Grandma called. Go home. Welding accident. It happened at work. Did I ask? Bye! Hey, is Andres really back now? Yes, Andres is back now. Well? Show us! STRONG ARE THOSE WHO FALL BUT KEEP ON GOING REGARDLESS They even want to take the fucking Mercedes away. Can I keep this coat? Oh, baby, you can have anything you want and desire. And can I go today... take this dress, these shoes... Please understand, my mother will kill me! Okay, you can have them. She'll kill me anyway. Growl like this, growl. You're not going back there? No. Fucking psychologists. They want to cure everyone, make them normal. There is no normality. There is only chaos in the midst of endless darkness. And that's it. Fuck, I don't understand how... how does anyone have any right to say anything about my life? They know nothing. There's a new shaman in Annelinn. They say he has the right aperitifs, he does this ceremony, and voila! All is well! The same shit you gave me last time? No, that was just some random G. He has the real medicine. I don't know. How much does it cost? I have to ask. Hello! You can get a perfect date set from the gas station. Look, drinks. First course. And the menu, here you go. Reigo, drive around a bit. A shy, older woman wishes to meet a younger man. She would like to try porn stuff. A younger man is looking for a daddy to support him financially. An experienced locksmith with the right tools is looking for a lock to pick. I would be a sailor and you would be the captain. You would make me raise the mast. - I'm a virgin and I would like to solve this problem. You should present a negative STD test and you should definitely be Estonian. I'm looking for a man who can't just fill a woman's crotch, but someone who can fill the void in her soul. If everything fits between two people, I'd like to stay together longer and build a relationship that will last. To find that true intimacy and love. We could... What's this? A gift. Oh! Ouch! Like this? Yes! I'll help you. I'm afraid of the bang. Who isn't? Well! - Oops, damn it! I'm sorry! That's okay. Thank you. - Enjoy. I wonder what's she doing here. She could easily be a model somewhere. I like women that are sexy... and respectable like that. And I like brunettes more than blondes. I like the distance between us. Me too. Hey, can you lend me money? Lend you money? - Yes. Viktor, come on. I want to start making the soup! Why are you wearing that? Are you going to a carnival? Look how nice it is! What are you waiting, hand me the plastic bag. Dad's still having a party. - Don't talk nonsense. We have to clean this mess up. Oh my God, what would people think... Take a blanket or pillow from here and find a nice place in the living room. The shaman is already waiting for you. You can fit nicely here. There's still room by the window. Make yourselves comfortable. If you feel emotions starting to come up, then the buckets are behind you. If you need to go to the toilet, it's back there on the left. I'm here to support you. Everything is allowed. Let's keep the space safe. Have a beautiful journey. Sit quietly on the river bank.

You think? I feel like I got rid of some shit. I feel bleak somehow... Let's have a top up. Hey, cunts! - Shut up, stupid. Come on, get over here! Wake up! Calm down! We already took a nap together, get up! Fuck you! Ouch! What do you want from life? I don't know. Maybe a relationship or something. Riina? I just want to move on, maybe to Tallinn or something. You haven't thought about going to work? I don't believe in working. - What do you mean? What's wrong with working? Well, what's wrong with it? - It's a complete waste of life. I feel like you're not getting me, what I really want to say. I have like this... fucking weight inside me, something is so closed up... Your fucking flue is closed. Fucking suicide camp. That's why I felt like shit. What's wrong with you, Karmen? Do you want to kill us all? I wasn't the only one partying here. Why don't you heat the fucking place for a change? Stop begging for attention with the sighing and all this heaviness talk. You don't have to go to work. Do you think you're fucking nobility or something? I need to go too. Where? To work. Now? No. Oh, I thought like now. There's no other like it. Here's a thousand. Does Andres know you're here buying a bike? No. No one is buying anything without Andres' permission. I don't know... Maybe now Andres will let me? Don't mock me with your money. Fuck! Hey, you have to go now. Andres and his men will be here soon. I need to talk to this Andres. - No, you don't. Go on. Well, go already! I really need to talk to him. - No, you really don't, go on. What is it now? Go! Sit here and be quiet! Does it hurt? Andres likes to say that God loves those who suffer. Didn't Dostoyevsky say that? No, it was Andres. I'm sure of it. Well? How long will it take? I'm almost done. Kaido, you have to go talk to the fucking county board. Why? Those bastards won't see me. It's been 20 years. How long can they go on about that old thing? It wasn't your fault. Doesn't matter. We'll wait for you outside. What wasn't his fault? Everyone around here knows the story. What story? Andres served in the army. In the nineties. Head of his regiment. There was an accident during the training. The men were caught in a storm at sea. Almost his entire regiment drowned. To this day his eyes have this strange dark look. But hey! You're still young, you have your whole life ahead of you. Hello! - Where are you? At this hour? Who are you with? I'm with some friends. You don't have friends! What are you doing? Playing ball. Come home. Your food's getting cold. Yeah okay! Bye! Oh, he's bad. He's so bad! Stop wiggling, bitch! There-there... - Ouch! Is breakfast over? Breakfast is for the poor. It looks awesome... Brunette suits you. Put it in there. Not there... My piggy looks so good. Doris told me you have a job now. Yes, at an IT start-up. I'm a verification specialist. Wowee! Got your first salary? - Yes. And she's doing her master's. That's our girl! I'd like to get my own apartment some time. Are you planning to buy something? Of course, I'd have to work for a bit and then see about the loan. If you have any problems, you can always ask me. I've bought many apartments. Try this. Piggy? Maybe we can sign this waiver paper today? I don't think I can handle this today. I wouldn't wait if I were you, the house has been pledged several times. Who knows what kind of surprises are waiting for us there. What's that empty room going to be? We're trying to have a baby. For once in my life, I want to do something right. You're going to be a very good mother. And the pink room? I want a cute little girl. But I want a cute little boy. You're so silly, what are you doing? Go away! Someone's here for you. - Renee? And you haven't paid your rent. I haven't been paid yet. Cool bag. It's not real. Are you fighting over men? Hey, put on something more comfortable. Why? We're going to a workshop. This was the first knot and now the second knot on top of it. Now around the body. Keep the rope tight. - Yes. Viktor, why is the door locked? What are you doing? Nothing. I'm washing. What are you washing, finish up already, your food's getting cold. I hate this soup. - You'll eat what we have. Why are you doing this to me? What if your mother could see you right now? But she can't. Does it matter? She hung herself. Did I want to see that? I've given everything to raise you to be a decent boy. Just like Martin. You should be happy he didn't abandon you. Most men would have disowned you. Now stop rebelling against me. Eat your soup, I can't look at you anymore. Hey, what's the deal? What do you mean? Take it easy. I told you I don't drink anymore. And I have a job now. Everything's changed. Hey, why didn't you answer your phone? He's been sitting in the living room for two hours. Look at him, he's a psychopath. What are you doing here? Well? What do you want? Alright Viktor, we are going to watch TV now and you are going home. I want Karmen to do it. Get going. Shoo! Get out! Out! Get out! Go! Get out! Get lost! Look what's going on in our damn county government. They won't even let us open a club house to pursue our interests. We must take over the county government, dammit, there's no other way. Who gave him permission? Go see what he wants. What do you want? To fight! Right now? No, I can't right now. I could do it the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow then. Get lost now! Step on it! Wait! No-no! Wait, it was lower. Ouch! No... was it? It should... - It was lower! Oh, wait, I'll do it again. Stand still. That's it! Fuck this! Let's do something else for a change? Like what? - I don't know. Watch TV? You don't want that. You don't want to watch TV with me. Wait, stay here. Please. ♪ Love is blind, ♪ ♪ it won't stop until it gets you. ♪ ♪ It throws pebbles at ♪ ♪ your window at night ♪ ♪ and you can't fall asleep. ♪ ♪ Love is blind, ♪ ♪ someday it will get everyone... ♪ This hair color is not for you. You're the one who wanted something like this. Who cares what I want? What time is it then? - About five or six. What was the resolution? No, it's up to the district court. I'm not the lawyer for that case. I wouldn't worry about that. Gerly will give us another month. All right, good day! Who's Gerly? - The chick who inherited the place. Some eyelash technician from Annelinn. Oh, yeah. - A very strange person. She came here last week when you weren't here. Okay. You don't want a sandwich? - Huh? A sandwich or something? - No. I'll go eat somewhere. Where? What difference does it make? Bye, girls. Bye! - Bye. Why do you like him? Because he's a dick. Well, tough guy? There isn't enough room here for the two of us. I guess only one can remain then. Where's your weapon? Raw! I am the weapon. Then we do this raw. Show him how it's done. Go on, fight! Raise your hands! - Where's your weapon? That was a good one! Get back! Back! Get back! Finished! Dammit, go away! Well? - Got nothing more to say? You know, Andres. It was all your fault. You stay here. Call an ambulance and say he stabbed himself in the kidney. So what are you... with Andres' men now... You know what, Jüri... Andres no longer matters. Hey, what do you think? If the county mayor doesn't give us this clubhouse, then we block the store, the post office, the ambulance? Yeah, I realize now that it's a stupid plan. Hey! I don't want any part in your 'act of terror'. I really don't want to get locked up again. Triinu, don't worry. I'll read it out again... - Nothing will happen to anyone. Motorcycle club Storm's application to use the old clinic and its garages for their club house is accepted by the county government. The county will also provide financial support to reconstruct the buildings. Complaints from the surrounding apartment buildings will be ignored in favor of letting local interest groups flourish. I will not go into details at this time. You're that Leida's boy, aren't you? What will I tell the people? No one wants this... shady business in our lives. People just want to live in a safe and quiet town. Look, Hendrik. Be reasonable and sign it. Things won't go so well for you a second time. If we have to come back, we'll cut your cock off and stuff it down Triinu's throat. And you'll be watching all of it. RENT MONEY I'm leaving for Tallinn. I'm going to my mother's. And Anja also went to someone's country house or something. I don't know, it's all so dragged out here, maybe you should also... Harder! Fuck me! Fuck me harder! Fuck me! What's wrong? Karmen. You do understand this thing is over now, don't you? What is over? - Don't act stupid. That we're done fucking? - Yes. We're done fucking. In the bigger sense, we're done fucking. Why? Is it my fault? Or something's wrong or I don't... I don't like it anymore. Jesus. Get out! Get out of here! What's wrong with you? Get out. MOM Karmen? Why do you let someone do this to you? What are these papers? Is that why you came? You can stop the fucking pretense! These things just need to be done. Otherwise you can't go on with your life. I don't want to go on with my life! And maybe I want someone to fuck me inside out, to feel any intimacy at all in this world. Sven. - You didn't go to the therapist? Fuck you! What do you care who screws me, or if they use barbed wire or not! And I'm keeping the Mercedes! Well? The electricity was turned off? I guess we haven't met. I'm Gerly. Oh... - Yeah. You haven't paid your rent. I'll pay tomorrow. Give me the keys to your Mercedes or pack your things and get out. I'll give you some more, hand me your plate. Eat up now. You're so skinny. Where's Viktor? I'm so glad you're getting along with Viktor. He needs a role model like you. Look, here he is. Well? Come and eat, don't just stand there. Viktor has turned into a punk now. Drawings on his face, comes home late at night. You should also go study somewhere like Karmen here. I'll go find you a nightgown. It's getting late. No, I'm not staying. - Yes, you are. You know, I actually came to talk to you. You didn't deserve it in any way, what I did to you. I don't know what came over me, I... I just lost it. There's nothing I can do about it, that life has... gone the way it has. I'm also suffering. What are you doing? I'm going to kill you. What are you doing? Get off! What are you doing here? Have you lost your mind? Get out! Get out of this bed! Get the hell out of here! Go to your room! Oh, dear God. Hi, Karmen! I've been thinking about you. How are you doing? Shitty... Don't worry. You'll get the thesis done. It's not the end of the world. Let me pay for that beer. Where does he live? Did you come to watch TV? Please leave. I have a lot of money. I have a beautiful home. I am loved. I'm going home. I am happy. Very happy. I'm beautiful. I have a lot of money. I'm valuable. I'm going home. I'm going... I'm going home. What now? "Life"
