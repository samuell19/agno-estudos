Damn, was that the brakes? I just want to be clear on the last thing I'm hearing 'fore I die. Imani, I didn't have time to bring the truck in. Mm-hmm. And that's a good thing. That means we got work. This job came up last minute. No, a good thing is not dying in a fiery crash. Not gonna happen, Imani, so just cool your jets. Oh, you laughing at that? Oh, is the new boy allowed to laugh at that, boss? Oh, boy. New guy can laugh at whatever he wants as long as he carries his weight and wears the company shirt. So what do we think? I think we're gonna need a bigger truck. Work order says one person's living here. Let's get to work. Think this dude's a priest? What? Those are baby angels. Stupid. Yes? Good morning. Uh, Mr. Mueller? Call me Vern. Alright, Vern, um... We're here to facilitate your move. Excellent. Come in. Come in, please. Vern: You would like to take a look around before you get started? Yeah, um, Imani, show Carlos the ropes. Uh, get the boxes, the bubble wrap, and the cart from the truck. And, Carlos, get the shirt on, alright? Got it. Please, sit. Can I get you something to drink? I'm fine standing, thank you. You -- You run a tight ship, Mr. Schillinger. I must say, I'm -- I'm very impressed with the way you the way you, uh -- the -- the way you handle your employees. Right. Yeah, I'm just doing my job, Mr. Mueller. Can I get you to sign that for me, please? Right. No, you're good. Relax, Imani. You're doing just fine. Imani, mira,man, I'm grateful for you hooking me up with this job and everything, for reals. I need you to look me in the eye right now, man. What? I'm 100% serious when I tell you that I'm notworking in no haunted house today. Stop. Why are you laughing? Look at it! Man, just because the original Crypt Keeper is living here in Grey Gardens don't make this shit haunted. I get that reference. No, I'm -- I'm good. Trying to be a good role model for my daughter. Good. No drugs in here. Schillinger ain't about that. Nothing that's gonna get you in trouble with your parole officer. Hey, speaking of, you and Schillinger have a -- an interesting relationship. Yeah, that's my boo. Man, you know the hustle. Who else gonna give ex-cons a good, solid job like this? Yeah, you're right. He's a good guy. Damn right. He went to prison, managed to turn his life around, and that ain't no easy thing to do. Bro, odds are stacked against us, man. Yeah. History repeats itself, lest we stop it from doing so. Kind of like his motto or whatever. Yeah, that's deep. Yeah. I like that. I like that. Schill's all about second chances. He a second-chance motherfucker. 'Sides, work ain't that bad. Damn sure beat be bouncing at the club -- too many fights. Not the best move when fighting's what I went in there for. Alright, get out of here. Geez. Oh, shoot! How do I get me a tool belt like that? Oh, you got to earn this shit, motherfucker, and you can start by taking some of them boxes in. Get, get, get, get to work. You've got to earn this shit, motherfucker. I'm just gonna take a belt. You got to -- Forget that. Thank you. So, your home is a bit larger than expected, but we should have everything out by midday tomorrow. Well, I'm sorry to say, but that won't do. Why is that? I told the new owner I would be out by morning. We'll do our best to accommodate you, but I can't make any promises. It's a very large home, and there's only three of us here. Let me be very clear -- It is in your very best interest to see that the first and the second floors are packed and shipped by first light tomorrow morning. The basement and the attic are not your concern. I will handle them myself. That is four times your rate. Uh, that's a bit unconventional. But we love four times our rate. Indeed. You should listen to your worker. Well, this workeris in. What about you, Carlos? I think my lady would be happy with the extra cash, but it seems like a lot of rooms and we don't -- we don't know what's upstairs. I'm not so sure, Vern. Fine. Here is another thousand dollars. It is imperative that the move happen tonight. Schill, come on. Let's do this. Okay, Mr. Mueller, you got a deal. Good. See that these boxes are on the truck by morning. They will be. Hmm, I-I got no signal. It's a very old house, constructed mainly of stone and brick. Yeah, makes sense, I guess. You'll get a chance to, uh, text her on break, Carlos. All nighter, huh? Looks like it. Let's get started in here. It's a lot of furniture. Let's get it covered, get it onto the truck. Uh, Vern, you might want to take a few steps back. Can get a little crazy in here. I will be downstairs, Mr. Schillinger, if you have any questions, and, uh, just knock. He can call me a worker all he want. We gettin' paid, ladies. We're only getting paid if we make the deadline. Let's work.Let's get it. Come on. Shit! Gosh. Hey, jefe? What's the protocol for when a doorway's being a tight little butthole? Uh, the protocol's never say that again, like ever. Okay, my bad. Hey, but for reals, what do we do? Let's move this back and out the way. Yeah, door's gonna have to come off its hinges. First, we got to close it. And then let's see. Need a flathead screwdriver. Just get that lodged right up in there, like so, and, uh, yeah, that's it. Think you can handle that? Okay. Bro, that was like two seconds, man, three tops. Glad you're impressed. Hey, I feel like you're kidding, but I'm for reals. I-I'm impressed. You just smile at me? You smile? He's got teeth. Alright, we're going two on this one, Carlos. Okay. Think you are strong, huh? Uh, alright, let's call it. Let's make it lunch. Keep it to 20 minutes. Still got a lot to do, right? Yeah. Fuck it. So what you boys spending your share on? It's going to my daughter's college fund. Well, alright, Oprah. What?I'm just sayin', Oprah always openin' up a school. I'm for reals. My daughter is gonna be the first one in my family to go to college. That's pretty decent of you, Carlos. I'm just fucking with you. You're a good dad. Just doing my best, I guess. What about you, Schill? Uh, yeah, first priority is getting the brakes fixed on the truck. Whatever's left over will go back into the business. Alright, let's take a little time to use the phones, and then we've got to get back at it, alright? Hey, man, come on!Carlos! Is that what I think it is? Yeah, I guess some of that money should go towards laser removal. So you a skinhead?I was. Not anymore. I needed protection in jail. Fuck. Fuck! Are you for reals? It was easy to rally around hate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "Rally"'s the right fucking word. But I don't practice or believe in the Brotherhood's hate anymore. But you out here calling it a "brotherhood." Look, I'll tell you what I told Imani a long time ago. If you want to leave, I get it. I'm out. No, no. 'Los, 'Los. Look, I wouldn't be here if I didn't trust this man with my life, and I wouldn't have brought you in, either. So why you still got them? Honestly, I don't feel like I deserve to be free of them. Got to earn clean skin. Yeah. I ain't got clean skin, neither. I sold it at first. Then I started using. Then they took my daughter away. So yeah. I'm saving my money for her. Sure, man. Yo, can I ask you a question -- about your tats? You got to be 100 with me, though. Sure. Why they so shitty? Some skinhead with bad breath and needle ink did it. Alright, Imani, how about you? Care to share? No, I'm good. We just had a raw moment in front of you. Now's your time. Cool. No. Yeah, no? I mean, I'm at peace with my past. Some dudes just deserve to catch these hands. I'm zen. Yo, 100%, you're not. 200% you're not. Fuck you. Uh, alright, we've got to get back at it. We still got a lot to do. For my first day, I'm doing pretty good, huh? Yeah, you working your ass of. I know. I can give you that. It's almost midnight. Yeah, we're making decent time. Place is huge, bro. Yeah, alright, I'm gonna get going on the bathroom. Carlos, you can go in the library, and, Imani, get to work on the kids' room, alright? Kids' room? Yo, the kids are 80. Alright, come on. I'm gonna do a quick sweep downstairs. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, you need help? No, it's just a quick sanity check. You guys get going. Something I can help you with, Mr. Schillinger? Uh, I suppose this is the off-limits basement. Yes, that's right. All handled. Nothing needed from you here. Something else? No, I was just noticing the lock. Ah, yes. The crest -- lock seems pretty old, safe to say. Mm, yes. You recognize it, uh, the crest? It looks familiar. Is it German? Oh, very good. Yes. Uh, you have seen it before? I'm not sure. Ah. Well, something about it must have caught your eye. Maybe I've seen it before and I just can't place it. I am impressed. Very few people would recognize it, an old German lock like that. Uh, are you a collector? No. Oh. Well, then, I wonder where you have seen it. Something else? No. I'll get back to work. Very good. Uh, do let me know if you have any more questions. Must admit, I'm suddenly just as curious as you are. This shit is creepy. Hey, Carlos! I'm gonna be done with my room in 30, 45 tops. Imani, it's not always a competition! But I will crush that time. Yeah, we'll see. Ow. You ain't in a haunted house, I promise you. It's just it's an old man, fucking just doin' his thing. Book box. Whoa, hey. Carlos, it's just me. Yo, I'm sorry, boss. It's -- It's this house. It's Vern. It's -- I'm just jumpy. Yeah, well, I think there's reason to be jumpy. Oh. It's like an actual nightmare that you just said that. Something's just setting off alarm bells, so just keep your head in the game for me and let me know if you see anything weird. Jefe,I've seen like a thousand weird things since I got here. Alright. And I'll let you know -- anything weird. Alright. I know you've been hustling. Let's see if we can pick up the pace even more, okay? I just want to finish this job and get the fuck out of here. Roger that. Okay. Alright. Okay. And what I was saying is you need to use a smaller book box, okay? Books are heavy. Trust me. You got it, boss. Fuck that. Small books in a big box, baby. And one big book. This thing. The fuck? Come on! This dude ever heard of a Kindle? Oh. Why's it in German? Oh. Come on, man! Hey, yo, boss, come here, man! Something weird, man. Anything weird, you said, right? Yo, boss, hurry up! The fuck, Carlos? You said anything weird, right? Look at that. This dude's got a ton of this. It's everywhere, man. Aah! The fuck you grabbing me for? You know you don't sneak up on a sister like that. How do you let your whisper louder than your yell? Guys, my gut's not sitting right. I-It's this place, this client. Say less. What you want to do? Maybe we just call it and leave. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh, that's fucking with my coin. Look, I get it, but we all could use the cash. Alright. I think if we tackle this together, we can do it. We double time it. Are you shitting me? Imani, Vern's the type of dude that pushes around a stroller with a fake baby in it. He can push whatever he wants in a stroller. If the money's right, the deal is real. Let's just finish this shit up and get out. Yeah, Carlos, look, my gut's going haywire, man, but we really don't got reason to call the cops, right? I don't know.Think about it. Is this man dangerous, or is he just strange? The dude's a freak. Okay, I agree, and look, it's my job to protect my crew and I don't take that lightly. So if you want to go, you just say so and we're gone. But I say we get this job done fast. Get that money.Man is like 100. It's three of us. That tuition ain't cheap. Alright. Let's wrap this shit up quick, alright? Yeah. Money makes me do crazy shit. Cool first day, by the way. Got a screwdriver? Yeah. Fuck! What you find? Don't! It's just a suitcase. Shit. But it's little.Jesus. Yo, hold up. You told me I could call it. I'm calling it. Let's go. Don't open it. It's birth certificates. Twins. Let me see. The actual human teeth. This is not happening. This is not happening on my first day! Some actual World War II shit right here. See? This dude could be like 100. Fuck! Fuck! Come on. Shh. Be quiet. It's coming from up there. Old-ass Vern told us to stay out the fucking attic, remember? Yeah, yeah, she's right. We got to get the fuck out of here, man. What do you think is up there? Monsters.Monsters. Look around. It's kids. Yeah. We got to call the cops. Sure as hell do. Imani, get outside and make that happen. Carlos, you're with me. Let's do this. We got this.Okay. Shit, it's locked. Hey, Imani, let me get your screwdriver. I got it. Yo, Imani, that was badass. Come on, baby. Shit! This is my exit cue. I'm gonna outside and find a cell signal, okay? Yeah. Alright. Well, hey, hold on, let me get that flashlight. Alright, Carlos, you're on watch. You hear anything, you hide, okay? Yeah, I got you. Vern? Oh, geez! Man, yo, Schill! Schill, Schill, Schill, Schill! Aah! Schill! Aah! Schill! Schill, help me, man! Don't leave me! Schill! Jesus! Oh, my God. Are you okay? No. What the hell is this place? I don't know. But you do. You knew something was way off right when we started this job. You know more than you're telling. I'd just be guessing. Okay, go. Holocaust experiments, the Angel of Death. What does that even mean? Josef Mengele. He was the Angel of Death. He was a Nazi doctor who was performing these -- these horrible experiments on the Jews in the concentration camps, genetic stuff. He was -- He was obsessed with... Yo, what? He was obsessed with twins. Oh, shit, twins?! So, what, this dude Vern, he's a relative or something? Or a copycat, uh, some nutjob continuing his experiments, I don't know. Oh, come on. Who's up there? Forgive my general appearance. Everything was packed for the move. Usually, I assure you, I am much more professional. Imani: No, man, come on, please. I really did intend to have you in my home only as movers, but then, you did not obey my instructions. And my -- my instructions were very, very explicit. And, well, this became inevitable. Guys, help! Please, help! No, no, no, no, the walls are reinforced. Your friends cannot hear you. What the fuck are you talking about? Carlos, Schill, help! I was always very fascinated by the ocular region, and the procedure which I will now administer will harvest one of your eyes. You sick fuck, no. No! No, no, no. I cannot -- I cannot allow you and your friends to leave this house, but instead of this whole thing being erased, I will put you to very good use. Hey, hey, it's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. It's okay. We're here to help you. Carlos. No, no, no, no. We got to help her, okay? Hey, what's your name? Shit. Carlos, do you have that marker? Okay, hey, look, here. Here, here, here, here. Anne. Okay. Hi. I-I'm Albert, and this is Carlos. Anne, Anne, Anne, is -- is there anybody else here? Where? Carlos, Schill! No, no. You will become part of my work. What work? Oh, many cultures have acknowledged the -- the power of the eye. Yes, and something that is fascinating to me is a tribe in Africa -- they -- they consume the eyeball for vitality. But I found that the enzyme of the optic nerve -- it must be injected rather than ingested in order to prolong life. No, no. Mm, decades of trial and error have taught me that the -- the specimen -- that would be you -- must be alive in order for the optic nerve to -- to release the enzyme. Where are my friends? Where are my friends?! Oh, they -- they will be here very soon, I assure you. No! No, no, no, man, please, please! Please, no! No! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, man, come on, please. Please, no. No! No, you -- No, no, no, no, man, no, please. Fuck you! No, no, no, no, no. Shh, shh. It is very quick work for me at this point. Aah! W-What do you think, Carlos? Carlos, we've got to help them. Carlos, look at me. We need to get them to the truck. Right. Okay, you take this flashlight. Anne, alright, here. I'm gonna give you my shirt, okay? Take this, Anne. Okay, alright, I got you. I got you. It's alright, it's alright. Just gonna get you to the truck. Okay. Just come with us, okay? It's okay. Shit. We need to find another exit. What about Imani?First things first, we need to find an exit route -- uh, windows, a rear door. Anne? Oh, shit! I see you have met Anne and Sarah. Mr. Schillinger, please release my girls. You piece of shit. You do this to children? I'm gonna kill you. Ah, well, if that is where you would like to set the tenor of this discourse... I will match it. Carlos, Carlos. Son of a -- I'll kill you! No, Carlos, you stay with the girls. She's not dead, Mr. Schillinger. No, there is still another eye to harvest, and I need her alive. She may experience extreme fear. It's okay. It's okay, come on. You must come to my lab for harvesting. Otherwise, this is all for nothing. They need medical attention. No, she needs myattention! No, these are children! They're not experiments! They're just like us! Nein! They are not just like us! No! Schill! Schill, come on. Schill, no, no, no, no, no. It's alright, bro. We just got to put some -- Stop the bleeding, man. It's alright. It's alright. Come on, man. Come on. No. Anne... I do not think this man is who you hoped he was. Hey, where you going?! Anne! I knew it. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Concentrate, concentrate. Breathe slowly. I can't. Can't what, man? I knew -- I knew there would be a reckoning. I can't do this without you, man, come on! Shit, come on, man! Please! Help -- Help -- Help the girls. No, please, no. Shit. Come on, Schill! Come on, man, come on! Oh, shit. Fuck you, freaks! Ah, finally... you reveal yourself, Mr. Schillinger. Huh. Hey, Sarah. Hi, hi. Aah! Go on! You can't get in, can you? You can't get in, can you?! Ha! Aah! You have made a truly terrible choice for your hiding spot. It is the room I use for my failed experiments. Zyklon B. It will only be a few moments, and it will take effect. Help! It is a shame it has to come to this. I really... would like to have used all of you in my work. Auf wiedersehen. Aaah! I died. I know I died. How? I brought you back. You're to help with her. Why?! I am a doctor and a scientist. This is my life's work. Why didn't you just let me die? I deserved to die. "Deserved"?! No. No, no, no, no. No, we do not have to hide anymore. This is our time, my friend. I know who you are. Yes, I do. You have been hiding, but now you are amongst your people here. I am nothing like you. Oh, well, your -- your tattoo seems to tell a very different story. It's prison ink! That's the story! That's it! No, no, no, no. This -- This is not the sign of a follower. It tells me you were a leader. Yes. I have people on the inside, mutual friends. What do you think you know? Oh, Heidelberg. Cass Vogel, his brother Friedrich, Simon Hesse. Need I go on? No, it is not a coincidence that you are here. I scouted the right man for this job. Who are you? Who are you really? I am Dr. Joseph Mengele. That's not possible. Absolutely not possible! How? I showed you. The same way that you yourself have cheated death. It's not possible. It is a serum I created harvesting viable subjects. In this particular case, it was your schwarzworker's eyeball. Imani? Schill? This dude's fucking crazy. Imani, you're alive. Are you okay? I have one fucking eye, Schill. Hell, no, I'm definitely not okay. This is fucked up, man. Who is this psycho? Schill? Ah, your friend knows more than he's letting on. Tell her the truth. Imani, don't listen to him. The hell is he talking about, Schill? Do you know what this, uh, this tattoo means, the eagle on his chest, the story it tells about the man who wears it? Man, yeah, I know all about that. Prison makes a person do wild shit to survive. Nothing new to me. So you believe that this, uh, this was earned in prison? Shut up! Imani, you know me. Don't listen to him. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Have you ever noticed how -- how this tattoo is clean? Professional? Not like the others, not roughshod? Man, they all look like trash to me. Ah, but this was long before he went to prison. What is he talking about, Schill? He did not find the Brotherhood in prison. No, he was already active. This tattoo means he was a deputy, not exactly a low-ranking position. Schill, I'm dead serious. Why is this man talking shit about you? Because it's true. No. No, no, no, no, no! It can't be! Imani -- No, it can't be right! We were supposed to be friends, man! You told me this was some prison shit! you wouldn't have lied to my fucking face! I wasn't lying to you. Man. Oh! I get it, Schill. I'm straight. You feel with that white guilt, here comes Imani to make you feel better. Fuck out here! I was the only guy that took a chance on you! An angry Black female ex-con who's unemployed! Remember that! Remember where you were! Oh, so you saved me now, huh?! Is that what you're telling yourself? Fuck you, Schill! I hope I helped your weak, white Nazi ass feel better about yourself. Fuck you. You should've stayed dead, motherfucker! There comes that rage. There's that rage we all knew was inside of you! Yeah, you keep talking. You just keep talking. I'll fucking kill you myself, swear to God. Strapped to that table? What are you gonna do?!Just keep talking. Keep talking, that shit, Schill, and you gon' find out. Fuck. You were right. About? I am who I am. This world will never let me be anything else. I read about you. I know about your experiments. I need to know how. Show me. Mm. An appeal to my vanity. Hitler saw the Jews as vermin, but the Jews considered themselves to be chosen. And they were right. Yeah. What? The trauma they have experienced over the centuries made them stronger as a people, and therefore, their -- their enzymes were much more potent. And Imani? Why use her for this serum? Her people, too, have suffered similar trauma, yes. And they -- they carry the enzyme, and Imani is, oh, an exemplary producer. The girls in the attic. Ooh... The girls. Yeah. Well, the more trauma they suffer, the stronger the enzymes... ...the longer I live. The house, the move... never was a buyer, was there? No. Too, uh, too many Jews have gone missing. And now I'm being hunted, so I have to relocate quickly. I was tipped off by a member of the Brotherhood. We have many well-placed brothers these days. Don't we, Mr. Schillinger? Yeah. I will now harvest the other eye, and then I will terminate her, and, uh... We must move now. I-I need to see how it's done. I'm weak. I'll need your help, but... I need to see how it's done. Hmm. Well... I suppose, uh... I suppose there is a certain honor in that. I heard you. Watch it. Imani! Imani, Imani! That's the Angel of Death, motherfucker! We worked hard for this. We've got to find Carlos and the girls. Okay. What? No, no! Imani! Violence -- I abhor violence. Nein!Oh. No! He was my baby! I created him! We got to get the hell out of here. What's that? No, no, no. No. Shit. No, no, no. Fuck! Anne! Can't do shit with broken legs, can you? Imani! Fuck you, Nazi piece of shit! We will never die. Help, help! Help us, please! Help! You idiot, you. You stupid, stupid, stubborn man. Fine. Do it, but you cannot kill all of us. No, we -- we are too strong now. You are one of us. No. No, I'm not. The proof of your belief is -- is etched into your skin! It's your blood. Aaah! You... You think you can kill our legacy, just carve it out?! No, no, no, you cannot. It is too big for you to just -- just cut away. You -- You think you can kill what has risen over the decades? You think you can kill our legacy?! Well, come the fuck on! Come on! So you, uh, stabbed me in the chest with that needle. For what? So we can live to fight another day, my friend. I told you -- Schill's a second-chance motherfucker. Straight up, Imani. Hey, come to think of it, both you motherfuckers owe me and my eyeball your lives. You're welcome. Thank you, Imani.
