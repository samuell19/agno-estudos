The last time I was here was 12 years ago. The curry wurst... you eat them with the skin? There's either "with' or "without'. - Ok, I'll have "with'. How long has it been since I've been here that I don't know that? Where's Sascha? 1 Euro 50, please. Was that 'with' or 'without' now? That was 'without'. I gotta run now. - I see. Is Sascha here? - Sascha's upstairs. I'm Tom Weise from the "Hustlaball". - You mean that Sascha? Yeah. Sascha from "Hustlaball". Oh god, what is this then? I sure wouldn't want to turn the lights on here. I just can't see it happening here yet. There are movie seats... - What can't you see happening? I just don't see the "Hustlaball" happening here. I mean when you compare this with a club in New York, then it's pretty awful here. Where is Sascha? Sascha? Yes? - There you are. There are these movie seats here. - They're all coming out They're all coming out, really? I mean, I knew a lot, but this place looks like... I mean there's a lot to do in this club. The difference is that naturally in New York Clubs... There it's completely asexual and you can just let go here, that's the difference. Did you catch a cold? No cold, I just lost my voice. Too much... Too much shouting, too much chatting. And, also a bit of a cold, yeah. The site basically functions... like it has for over 15 years in the gay magazines. Well, prostitution is, of course, illegal in the USA... and it was clear to us from the start... that we'd be dealing with legal problems. But like I said the print magazines, they also list escorts. It's a different thing on “rentboy... because everyone from all over the world can view the site. Here, for example, is New York City, that's where most of them are. You've got a phone number and can deal directly with the rent boy. We're not only in London and New York, but also in every small city... also in Berlin and Vienna, everywhere. That's how we make money. It's amazing that in a country where it's illegal, we've become such a big name... and are pretty well recognized. And that's because I've thrown in... my own personal energy and power... to make the site more personal. And also with the events and the connections to the actual escorts, those people who do it. To show that they aren't assholes or purely money-hungry, but that they're also great guys. No, the decision to go to the USA... HIV was also a reason. I simply realized that in Germany, back in 1993/94, that it was very difficult... and guys were dealing with it in a very depressing way. I even went to the Cologne Positive Congress as a delegate. As I stated my opinion about how I live and deal with HIV, they either didn't want to hear it or found it ridiculous... that I was dealing well and positively with it. It was a very depressing... I don't know... atmosphere. I mean, you can't forget, that was the early 1990's. I found it awful and had to get out. I think, there were several reasons. Well, there's a lot happening through the rest of the year. I've got a "rentboy"” tour that goes to 18 cities, I've got pool parties. I've got 10 Gay Pride Parades. Are you very stressed out? - No, actually not, I'm surprised. It's because I now have a lover who balances me out. It wasn't always that way? - Nah, I was always alone... and always took so many things personally... and was always too serious. How do you think it's going so far? There is always total stress before the show starts. Different than in Berlin? - No, not at all. Why? - Because 70 performers are human too, they simply need their caressing. How do you think it's going so far? Interesting, but something's missing. Sort of like coitus interruptus. Everybody's celebrating 'Sex', but it's not really happening. Normally I don't have anything on under my kilt, but after yesterday's incident, I understand why the majority of the American people react the way they do. They're scared shitless of the laws here. I'd say that 90% of all the porno-stars I've met... are also escorts. Or after a couple of months or years they realize... that over 90% of their money comes from the world of escorting. So, it's over. We're leaving. So, was it successful? - I hope we'll be more successful. What did you like and what not? Well, it was very erotic... but the finish was missing. And that would have been? The penetration. That's the core of the entire story: I've been doing something for the past 10 years, which is actually possible for everyone. But it was more difficult for me, because unfortunately I came here illegally with HIV. The United States along with Saudi Arabia... are the only two countries where someone with HIV, whether a potential immigrant or as a visitor will be turned away... and simply cannot become legalized. I've lived the past 10 years under these extreme conditions. And that's the story of why I'd like to return to Germany. It was great, we had wiener schnitzel. And now we're going quickly to Lars. Lars and Freddie live together. They're the famous fetish escorts from Germany. Well, Freddie just arrived... and Lars is flying to LA to earn some extra cash. Freddie's staying here and has to earn money... busy as a busy busy bee... First we're going to Lars. Oh! American flag, how scary! Yes, the Americans love that. - Oh no! They hung a flag there! They love that. Is this a one-bedroom? Or what would you call it? Or is it a big studio here? - No, it's a one-bedroom. And costs? $1,800 a month. It serves it's purpose. Yes, how much would it be in Germany? In Berlin? - For this kind of apartment? Yes, what's the comparison? Maybe...300? - 300 Euro. - Wow! Heating included. But as an escort you only earn about 2,000 Euro a month there. Nah, between 500-1,000 Euro if things are going well. As an escort? - Yes. Depends on how you sell yourself. And how much do you want to earn here, do you have a goal? Yes, I do. Two times as much, three times, 4x, 5x, 6x as much? Let's start differently. Do you want 2 or 3 clients a day? Or just one? I'm don't measure in numbers of clients. - Sometimes one does that. No, I don't do that, I say the money will come to me. Right, sometimes you get an overnighter or weekender... or even a trip someplace. - Exactly. I mean it does also help that you've got someone here from Germany... who can tell you in your language... how it works with escorting and stuff. - Certainly. That's a help, isn't it? What's the most important with this apartment? The location. It's ideal. For an escort it's a one of a kind location. After he's lived and worked for 3 months here, he'll understand... that New York's a special city. - An insane city! There is so much money here that you can earn, an incredible energy. How much can one earn here? - That's not hard to say. But I'm not saying anything. - Why not? Why should I say something? - Secret. I'm not saying anything. - You don't have to say about yourself. Secrets of the trade. - Hard to say. One doesn't talk about money. You don't tell me how much you earn. - Oh, god, no! This is my living room. It's not very big but very sunny. - The apartment has one...? One room and a living room and a bathroom, but of course, includes a balcony. I go down there to the promenade, am directly outdoors, near the Statue of Liberty and simply have quiet. There are no cars here. Simply incredible vacation time. It's really not New York. This is a valuable piece that I bought at an auction... "Live Out Loud" - for gay youth. This costly, $10,000 genuine Madonna from Steven Meisel. Have your parents ever visited you in the States? I always say I don't have any parents any longer. First reaction is always: "Are they dead?" No, these parents are still living... somewhere. I've... The last time I saw my parents was over 15 years ago in Berlin. My father stormed into my apartment with my mother... and officially disowned me. And said I was no longer his son. He disinherited me. And the always the question: 'Why? Because you're gay, or because you are HIV positive?" No, it didn't have anything to do with that. My parent somehow always had a problem with... money. That I couldn't manage money or that I was crazy. My parents always thought me as crazy. They never believed I actually achieved the things I did. For example, I studied at the Otto-Suhr-Institute... at the Free University Berlin. But my parents never believed it. I was the only one who completed the pre-university exams... and my parents wouldn't believe it. They were people, who like many parents, belong to another generation... and can't accept that their kids could have it better than they did. Tom Weise invited me to come over to the USA. I'd never been here before, even though I have US citizenship. It never really interested me in the past, I pretty much rejected the USA... and as a result my black heritage as well. My goal is to earn as much money as I can, because I have a stack of bills waiting for me in Germany. All together tens of thousands. So I've set a goal of 3 to 4 months. I had my first customer in January. I realized it isn't much different here as in Germany, except that they are all ready and willing to pay more for it here. Probably, because they have more money... but also because this country is so prude. They often don't have many other choices than to order escorts. We profit as a result, of course. So let's take a peek inside. How does Lars Svenson live? Wait a second; we have to demonstrate how this play sheet works. Yep, of course it's sexy and the dildo comes on top here. Which dildo will be used by your client tonight? Your parents don't know? No, of course not. They know that I do films and photos and the like... What kind of films? - I did one with "Cazzo". They found the video cover at my home as they were cleaning. And your father said... -'You really don't have to do that." Aha... But you wouldn't want them to know that you do escorting? No... Even though escorting and porno are pretty close to each other? But they don't know that, no. I told my parents I'm a personal assistant. It's enough. That's good. A personal assistant and that the company requires that I travel a lot. And what's it like with you Freddie? Do they know? Yes. They know. I mean, it depends on how you deal with it. Wait a minute, there are two passports here! A German and an American. I don't believe it. But there's no American here. They've got to be Freddie's. He actually has two, what an outrage! Why? You'd also like to have two passports? Yes, I'd like to have two passports. Basically, most people are envious of my citizenships. And can't believe that it's not so important to me. The last time I was in the USA, Tom told me himself he was illegally here. It surprised me somewhat, he could have hidden for so long. That it worked out. I always thought they track people like that down. But evidently not. I've done everything that a citizen of this country could do. I've often been told: I've done a lot of community work, lots of volunteering. I've been active for children with HIV, and the homeless and elderly. And I'm thankful for all that I have experienced here. But actually also thankful that I haven't paid taxes in this country. When I see, that over the last six years... the government used taxpayer's money as they pleased... for an illegal war based on lies. Then I'm thankful to say that my money... Every month... I've given away at least... $1,000 to $2,000. Over the last four years, I've donated $50,000... to charities of my choice, my own causes. Things that I wanted to support. Is that larger than usual? It's the largest parade float that the company gave me. It's a company that does all of the parades in New York. CeCe Peniston is the singer this year. Each year we have a recording artist on the float. I love it. Each year when we pass by St. Patrick's Cathedral... No one is allowed onto the church grounds. The cardinal has forbidden it. Gays are not permitted. There's always a group of 6, 7 people standing there with signs that say: 'GOD HATES FAGS! A half a year ago there was a scandal involving Reverend Ted Haggard. He was big religious rights leader here in the US. He was outed by one of our escorts. Well, I never had a relationship. The longest one was 3 months. But I also think that there were many obstacles that led to this, that no guy could put up with me. Obstacles like HIV of course, although that's one of the least reasons... My immigration story, of course... "rentboy" is also a reason for rejection. There are many reasons why I drove off the men. I was also very sick. I'm someone with HIV, who unfortunately has been very sick. Just now, I've become healthier and I think it has to do with Keith. But in the last years I was... I'd say for 10 years, I was very, very sick. And it's not easy to have someone then. And I think, the situation with "rentboy" was the worst. It didn't make it easy to meet someone on my level. I simply couldn't have an escort as a lover anymore. That was clear and policy. When I first came here I was completely bound to my grandmother. She gave me 1,200 D-Mark a month and kept my head above water. Until my end, I'll be forever grateful. After she became ill and couldn't continue the support, it was over for me. I could only move from friend to friend and was on the streets. Why I did "rentboy" was a clear issue of choice. I had no other choice. As Jeffrey said to me one evening: It was my only choice. It was my only possibility. It wasn't my wish. I don't ever want to see Jeffrey in Berlin, in my new life in Europe. I never looked for a friendship with Jeffrey, was never friends with him. That means: Goodbye forever. It has to do with an enormous dependency I had with Jeffrey... over the past 10 years. A co-dependency. I also had such a dependency with my father. This kind of dependency can only mean ruin in my life. Well, Tom got us the room. The two German sluts are in one room and can get drunk and smoke. We both drink Gin and Tonic. No, we don't drink, don't smoke don't have sex, we're in the US. It's not allowed. We're going to the gym everyday. - Yes! Well, I think we stand out here... because we blatantly call things as we see them. They're not used to it here. They're not used to it when someone says: 'Know what, buddy, this party is really boring. C'mon, let's go back to the hotel and fuck'. They flip out. Right now Tom is pretty relaxed. At the moment, we don't have any problems. Sure, we fight every now and then. Differences in opinion about the "Hustlaball". But basically I can do what I want in Berlin. Before I started "rentboy"... I worked for a short time as an escort and a stripper... and even did a porn film. But it was clear that this lifestyle as it was, didn't really interest me and I gave it up. But in the 10 years that I've done "rentboy"... I've gotten to know these people more I've thought to myself: "Man, if you do it right it's a great life." Sometimes I'd like to have had the attention they receive. I've heard so many stories from escorts... who have been flown to foreign countries or to some hotel... and were paid basically for not doing anything. Of course, they provide their services. Sure, sometimes I'd hoped to have had a little bit of that. Clean? Well... nothing is clean here. The Germans would need to come first and properly clean the whole house. Look at this shit. To get a house on the bay, just like a house directly on the ocean... is something special. There aren't that many of them... most houses are in the middle of the island. It's a beautiful view we've got. Well, we're both HIV+ and... I've got Hepatitis C as well. That has made things more difficult for me. I've become more sickly... I've lost weight. I have gotten lipodostrophy with HIV+, facial wasting. I've had to prove myself again being in a area of work... where everybody looks great, or most. The majority. And it's all about models and youth and good looks. It was extremely hard... when I heard comments from models that said: For 7 years, up until about a year ago, I took chrystal meth and... that's one of the reasons why I have Hepatitis C. That hurts unbelievably. I'm such a controlled person and for me it was simply unacceptable. First I eat breakfast and then I take these here. So that I have something in my stomach. And do you tolerate them well? These protease-inhibitors and these blue ones, yes. Now I just need to take something for the Hepatitis C. How will you do it in Germany for medication and such? I think I'll continue to take them... and will probably begin with “Interferon... That's the chemotherapy-like substance that one takes... to get the Hepatitis C out of the body. Well, it was another... death sentence, right? Apparently, Hepatitis C is harder to cure here than in Germany... or Europe. 50:50 or so. I can get a sickness, I can get pneumonia, and then... I leave Keith behind. And that scares me. That's pretty awful and sometimes when I have a bad day... I get scared that I've taken on too much... and gotten into something risky that could overpower me. Now that I'm leaving this country... I'm fully aware that I might never return again, because I was here as an illegal alien. Once I leave the country I can't return for at least 10 years, That's a simple fact. The only possibility, I think, is if I marry Keith... and take on his last name becoming Tom Richmond. My relationship with my business partner Jeffrey... ends in a couple of days. Once I leave the office I don't ever want to see Jeffrey again. The greatest fear in the last 12 years was my illegal status. That I had no legal documents... and of course couldn't leave the country. The fear that I'd be deported. That, as a result, I was endangering my health. I had to become much more careful in thelast 12 years... not to get into any situation with law enforcement. The living situation hasn't gotten any better? No, I wouldn't say that, because I didn't take a look at the bathroom... and in fact, there isn't one. There is a small shower stall, but that's a problem because it doesn't make douching too easy. It's not escort-convenient enough. What does it cost? Should I say? - Yes. $1,200 a month. That's a bargain for New York. Well, the first week I wasn't too sure if it would work out, the way I thought. By the second week it began to work out... and then slowed down noticeably. Because even in New York at some point I was sucked dry. Literally. So it all happened rather quickly, 2-3 weeks? - Yes, all rather quickly. And with the upcoming summer it'll now slow down even more. So, since... mid-May, I'd say it's rapidly slowed down and then it's a advisable to travel. Every possible city, always for just a few days, to keep the fresh-meat factor going... And that's all relatively easy to do through the site? Yes, it is possible, on “rentboy... Of course there are a few other websites. Interesting how the others are always named 'escort of the day'... but not me. Up until now it's only happened to me once, in January. How does it work? The more often your profile has been clicked onto, the more likely one will become 'escort of the day'. That's what it costs for 3 months. - How much? $589.85 But you also earn it back. Of course it's much cheaper in other cities. Here in the US one is always asked... the exact information on the phone that is already answered in the ad. It's a phenomenon. Perhaps Americans don't trust what's written based on their experiences. Could be, but it seems silly for me to repeat the information. So... I don't know, perhaps it's an American thing - hard for me to understand as a German. In the meantime, I try to be more relaxed about it... and point out that the information is already in my ad. If they want to know something else, they should just ask. Otherwise, I think it's better to hang up. Tom expects to come to Berlin... and be loved by all. He's not a superstar there. Nobody knows him. Especially in Berlin where the mentality is... that nobody gives a shit what you do, you just can't be an asshole. Nobody's interested if you are with a particular porn company... or sell for them or are sold by them, nobody's interested. Sure, in other countries it's different... but in Berlin it's pretty much unimportant what one does. The personality is more important and money actually less. I received a temporary passport, only valid for one month and I am using it to get out with. He should have arrived yesterday, but due to fog in London... they cancelled the last two flights. How did the dog arrive? - By freight. This morning? - No, yesterday. They didn't want to let him in. It was clear that the luggage wouldn't be there. What else should we expect? We've already had so many difficulties. And we both already have colds. No, I expected it to be colder. The danger is that Keith and I won't find... what we're hoping for in Berlin. I think Keith knows that he might not find a job. That we might have problems with the legality of it. We have to get through with our love, our attitude. We have to believe that it'll work out... or we wouldn't be doing this. How...? I'm not disappointed, I'm happy. I'm happy to be home. Honestly, what you've done means so much to me. This is the first "HustlaballBerlin" that I can take part in. Exactly in one week... is "Hustlaball Berlin" and I'm here. I never thought that I'd make it. No! Keith! Keith, rolls. What's this here? - Another bar. - Ah, looks good! The award ceremony will take place here. And what's that? That'll be one of the VIP areas or the entire VIP area? For all VIPs. At 17 I started organizing my first sex parties in the countryside. It got grew and grew, I always had new ideas. Then I met Jeffrey, through Jeffrey I then met Tom. I read the Hustlaball's concept... and thought it was great. Well, I hadn't personally been to any of these parties, but found the concept great. I phoned with Tom and found out that they wanted to do the event in London. And said to him: "Why not Berlin?" Consequently he said: 'Do it." I can depend on Sascha, I don't need to... - Let's go to the cellar. How, and here is where they're going to have sex, in the cellar? And where is the light? - It'll be built in. The main focus is on... - Sex and nudity, and... sex live shows and fisting. People come down here to fuck... You can't do that in the US. In the early days there was a "Hustlaball" darkroom. - When? When the "Lure" was still in the New York meat-packing district. 1998/99... The "Hustlaball" 1999 was still pretty wild, but then the administration ruined everything. After that there were no more clubs on the sleazy side. Where do we go next? Yes, well next year I'd really like to get a larger space, right? You won't find one. - How could that be, it's Berlin? Because they wouldn't like to do that kind of event. You can do everything in Berlin. The old locations, that used to be really great, have in the meantime all been furnished so that they'd rather... have a fancy stockholder's meeting. And you can do an event like in Las Vegas, but the right mood won't be there. Who is the Hustlaball's producer? Yeah, well... we'd probably argue about that one... both. He's the more the producer, but I'm more "Hustlaball Berlin". And you don't argue?- Nah, he likes to be up in front... and I prefer to be in the rear... It works out ok. The most important pieces of luggage, Miss... Gabriel, are still missing. There is medication in them... that keeps us alive, ok? I've lived now for three days without medication, but it's no big deal I guess. Keith and I aren't doing well, we're constantly coughing. It was very strange to come here for the first time. There was so much happening. Upon our arrival I didn't have time... to realize what it means for me to return after 15 years. In fact, I haven't even... had time to think about it. It's just... I'm just beat. I've completely forgotten New York. I'm so sorry that I'm late! - No big deal, Mr. Weise. He's my partner, Keith. Come on inside. Well, I've brought things from my doctor of the last 10 years. After 10 years, we are permitted to destroy our files. I'm so sorry, I don't have your medical records any more. I really don't know anymore what was happening then. Well, like I said, in October... 14 years ago I sat here. 14 years ago... - Do you remember how I sat here? With three friends? One was my ex-lover, one was my best friend... and one was a friend from Berlin. I know that right here I screamed a lot... and cried. I had 120 T-cells when I came in here 14 years ago. From our standpoint it was in the late stages. In those days, people in the early phase were dying, especially and suddenly from PCP and other non-typical infections. We never talked about how long I had, only that it was acute. And you asked: 'What do you want to do now?" I said: "I want to go home". There was no more going home at that time. I was estranged from my parents, separated. After I got my diagnosis and... went to Dr. Reuter, I lost many friends... including all three that sat here. It was a terrible time and I was really alone. And I said to myself: 'Ok, man, if you must... you have to find our own way! I'm grateful that I'm still alive, that I'm sitting here. And confronted with the second diagnosis - Hepatitis C... It has really been my last... warning for me: "You have to do something.' That I've gotten Hepatitis C is... I was also very disappointed as I heard this. I thought Mr. Weise wouldn't do such a thing. In a time where one should think that... everyone knows what they can catch... Not all of course, but many know how problematic a co-infection is. I don't want to frighten you, but it can be very problematic, or the therapy can be ineffective, that's all it takes. When we lose patients with the co-infection... we lose them through Hepatitis C, not through HIV. Oh my. - No rooms? We have three stages tonight. - I see. Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3. The shows start parallel, there will be something happening everywhere. So, do the opening of the big porn star show? -Yes. If it's so full everywhere... how does one get through? Stay by the stage. Next to the stage you have room. Shall I quickly show you? - Please. I'm disappointed in a few people. Certainly in Jeffrey... but also Brandon and Freddie. Well, that's... And all the others somehow. I come here and everyone are: 'Hey, hmm.' I mean, haven't ever been here. Somehow strange? - Yes, it's very, very strange... For me it's surreal, as if I weren't here. But you already saw Jeffrey? - No, it was the first time. And how was it? Strange. Wasn't necessary. After the weekend is over things are definitely going to change. Of course, the "Hustlaball" will continue, but it's odd now, because... we're now in Berlin and not in New York or Las Vegas any longer. And I don't know Berlin anymore, I'm a stranger here. They we've been here more here than I have. It's not always like this by me at home. That's really the last time that... something like that is happening in my apartment. I'm so happy. I love Berlin. I'll be living here for a year or so. I wanted to grab the curtain and see where Jeffrey was. I wanted to tell him that I didn't tell Shequida to say that. I think Shequida and so many others, have no idea... that I no longer have anything to do with "rentboy". I'll never work with this man together again. And I also won't wear these stupid "rentboy" wristbands. How ridiculous. Bitches! - Yes. I've always unbelievable overdone things. That doesn't have anything to do with the USA. It comes from my childhood where I always had to prove myself. As a child I was very skinny, small and helpless. No big bully. Probably already at a young age I was a typical sissy. It was just endless. All that forced me to have to prove myself. I'd like to take a break from that. And why did they leave? What happened? Tell me, Sascha! - Why? - I don't know. Since I've been here I've often asked myself: "Is it still right for you?" Keith is now on your side, who has been very supportive. 'But is it really still you?" Now some people reappear - it's a déjà vu and very strange. I've already had many moments where I've said: 'Do I still want this, is that really still necessary? Or are you only doing that... because it's the only thing you've built up in the past 10 years?' Where shall we sit? - Please take a seat, the two gentlemen. You have applied for the registration of your partnership. "According to the German laws governing name registration we choose to use the birth name of the first partner, Richmond, as our common partnership name.' Mr. Richmond, and I mean this Mr. Richmond. Now I'll have to be careful with you: First sign 'Richmond' and then "born: Weise'. Take the ring for your partner. So, may I present you with your family album. Both Gentlemen may now be congratulated. It is usually done with money... Money? Oh yes, that would be appropriate. We need to go directly to the health insurance office... to register Keith onto my health insurance. So we can immediately get his medication which run out again. The part about the names was important for me... so I can also have anew identity... and really be together with Keith. Like every other heterosexual couple. And also have anew start with this name... in the country where I was illegal for so long. So I won't have any problems there. WEISE'S DRY CLEANING My mother stood behind the counter. She often worked in this shop. And I was quite often in this courtyard, where my father had his office. Quite often we... we killed time there. It hasn't changed, it's still the same shop.
