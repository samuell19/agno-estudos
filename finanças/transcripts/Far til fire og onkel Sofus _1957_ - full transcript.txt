See! Uncle Anders is there! Uncle Anders, wait a minute! Aah, it was nice, you came. I'm so confused... Yes, it's not so strange. Think that you will see him after so many years. 27 years, yes! - And you have posters with. - Yes, maybe he doesn't know me. Don't you look alike? You are twins. Yes, unfortunately. At school I always got an itch for the trouble he made. So let's get going, shall we? - The machine must come from there. - Or from above. - Well, yes. - I can't see it yet either. - Where is he from? - Texas. What is that for? A place in the USA. He has a big farm over there. He's a millionaire! Of course, that's everyone that comes home from America. It's funny, Uncle Sofus is coming home for your 70th birthday. Or 140 you might say... How you must have missed him. I actually couldn't claim him. No, can't stand him! He has always been a terrible quarreler. But now we have to hope, it's gone from him with the years. - You certainly are, Uncle Anders. - Aah, there it is! No, it's a seagull... - There it is! - Where? - There! - No, how high up it is! Uh, how pretty it is! There is Tivoli! Naturally, Tivoli is there! There's no one who runs away with that, right? I said there is no one that runs away with it, is there? And there is the Round Tower, yes... Naturally, the Round Tower is there! There hasn't been an earthquake, has there? I get so moved when I see the old city again. You are fine, yes. Wipe your eyes and blow the nose. They look dangerous. Are you not happy to return home? What does it matter to you? I say, what's wrong with you?! Welcome home, Sofus! Uncle Sofus! Hello, Uncle Sofus! Excuse me, is that you, whose named Sofus? Yes, if you don't mind it. Then someone stands over there and waves to you. He looks like you, Uncle Anders. I think he's lost it, the old corpse. - Come on, we're going into the arrivals hall. - Yes. Mie, come here. When he comes, you give him this bouquet. - Can you remember what you are going to say? - Oh yes! - There he is! - Yes, there he is! Good day, dear brother! Welcome home! Good day, dear Anders. You're getting old, aren't you? Well, I'm not older than you. - Whose are all those kids? - They are our brother-in-laws. It's mine. Good day. Was it him who was married to our deceased sister? Yes. - Do you have your 'car' out there? - My what for nothing? 'Car?' oh! I really don't have a car. So get a taxi! I'm going to my hotel right away. Well, Uncle Sofus! We have lunch prepared at home. Never eats lunch. See you later. Come on, Anders. - Now he forgot to get the flowers! - He doesn't want to go home. I apologize, but you can see: He hasn't changed his ways! Oh, but then we have to see if we get home. Yes. We didn't have to dress up for that. That's it, I say, he's a stupid slug. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Oh, my gosh! Are you alone? Where are you the American? Was he not with? He was going to his hotel. I'm sorry about that. I was so anticipating to see him. There is nothing to look forward about. Howdy, Jensen! You should be glad you weren't there. It was a burnt out. He didn't even have presents for us. We can just eat lunch right away. Well, it was nice! I'm farmished. May I not get out of this girl clothes? Yes, go ahead. Got up and change right away. It sure looks delicious! Expensive, but lovely. - We could have spared them here. - We can rejoice over them ourselves. Now we're going to have a bit of a party. (the doorbell rings) - It wouldn't be them, would it? - I don't think so. I go out and look. Good day. Well, is that you, Peter? Well, let's get inside. - Sis has invited me to breakfast. - Yes? Has he come? Uncle Sofus? Yes, but unfortunately he didn't come with. So we are a little disappointed. Yes, special Sis. - Nah! - They know, all that with the lunch. She has really had a mess since this morning. Listen... couldn't you try to raise her mood? Well. I can try it. - She's out in the kitchen. - That's nice. - Hi with you, Peter. - Do you want to eat with? It was cozy. No, no, no, Peter! You know, I'm so tickly! I'm dropping the pot! Oof! It's glowing! - Oof! It's glowing! - Said it here. Then maybe you can learn to keep your fingers to yourself. Please take a seat, Peter. There are enough chairs. - It was a shame, they didn't come. - Yes, Sis has even bought smoked eal! Do you know what we're doing, Mie? We eat it ourselves. Go ahead, go on! Morning. Good morning! Good morning, Mrs. Sejersen. Have you seen the baker boy? Nah. Oh, They didn't get any morgenbread either. Yes, that's the usual. I send Ole to the baker, so he can take your bread with him. Ole! Hurry up, you're going to the bakery! Ole, you're going to the bakery. Do you hear what I say? You're going to the bakery! Wake up! Yes, yes, yes! Why does it always have to be me? Because you are the most beautiful and nicest and most gif-ted! Ork, stop it! Oopsy! You will get! No, no, no! Stop it! Hold up! Out with you and brush teeth! Such nonsense! - You know what, little Ole? - No. Nah! I'll come after you! Can you get out, you little worm! Cease it! Stop it! Cease it, or I'll tear the ears off you! - What kind of tabernacle is this? - It was just... Just what for nothing? Would you like to go in there and get dressed! And then that rowdyness here early in the morning... - Ole, where are you? - I'm coming now, Sis. - I need to fetch our morning bread? - Yes, it is here. I also also bring it to Mrs. Sejersen. Here you go. If your errand boy is sick and there are more at our end of the road, just let me get them. - Then you'd better get a basket. - Yes, please. - Do you have time now? - I won't be at school before nine. He gave me two crowns and said, I could earn that every day. It's nice, because we soon have to buy a birthday present for uncle Anders. - Shall him Sofus not have anything? - Yes, you can never make a difference. - Where do we get all that money from? - We two must also take a job. And so we have our piggy bank. There's probably not much in mine! Watch out, Jensen! Bummer! She was the new one from our class. - She comes driving by car every day. - What's her name? Birthe. She is really important! - Pick me up again at two, Andersen. - Yes, ma'am. Hey! You were just about to run our dog over! Well, was it yours? The little ugly mutt? - Come on, Mie. - She's always so naughty! She's just stupid in the neck! Oopsy! Do you have dog with you? You can't, you know that well. Yes. Home, Jensen. The man can't stand you. - The man? - Sorry, principal. Think, if you all had dogs with you to school! Orv, you wowsy! Definitely fun! There, there, there! Now not too funny. Better hurry home, Jensen, before there's trouble. Awra! Look there! Jensen, are you really smart? Aah, how sweet it is! Now she's coming! Keep it in the closet! Hurry up, Per! Be careful! - Good morning, children. - Good morning! Then we sit down. And then we will spell a few words from the new lesson. TREE And what does it say? (the dog barks) LEAF. And what does it say? (the dog barks) Who was that? Now that might be enough! (yeah) - Are you so ready? - Woof. Do you want to go outside immediately! (the dog barks) Now it's too crazy! One more woof, and you have to take the consequences yourself. (the dog howls) Ahh! Jensen, hurry! It's principal! Come on! Lay down. And stay lying down. Phew! Yes, then we turn to page fourteen and take out the essay papers out. May I ask for some peace, if that pleases the ladies and gentlemen? Yes, thank you, see you well. Mie, would you please go up and wipe the board clean? A thousand thanks. Yes, then we translate the piece four until I come back. If it's not too big a burden for you - - of the otherwise excellent brains of the lords and ladies. Understand? - Yes! - Good. Oof! Birthe, you knocked me over! You don't have to worry about that. - Did your rich uncle come from America? - Yes, well he did so. What did you get? He must have brought a lot of nice gifts. It's actually not worth it to list. Aah, let it be! He's not really rich, he's just cheapscate. Ouch! Hello! Are you here someone at home? - Yes, I'm standing over here in the kitchen. - Do you have an opener? - What are you going to use it for? - Til at pop a prop op with! There is one inside the buffet. - And a glass? - Yes. Nah, good day, little Sis. Good day, Uncle Anders. What's wrong? Sofus. He is worse than the worst weather! You would see how he ruled in the hotel! Do you think he could settle for a sole room? Nah, no! - A whole suite, little Sis! - He also has enough dollars. He wades in them, the beast! Everything was wrong. The shoes must not be worn across, it would be along. One bed was too hard, the other too bloody! The lamps were wrong, and the view obviously didn't suit him either! I wish him to be on the other side of the globe! - Who? Who are you talking about? - Sofus self-evident. He is completely impossible, says uncle Anders. Nah? - Good day, old friend. - Good day, Anders. - Hi,Uncle Anders! - Good day, sweet children! - Is there something wrong? - It's your uncle Sofus. Yes, he your screw-flint nuts! That's it, I'm saying: He has a peep in the cardboard box. Now you're not going to get involved in this here. Uncle Sofus may not mean it so badly. Yes! And I've decided that I don't want to bring him to our birthday! Nah, Anders, we can't be familiar with that. And when it's time to prepare a nice party for you. Listen, where is Per? - Here! - Where are you going? Out with the other vikings, there is someone, who's getting muffed! One on the gong, so they lose their shape! (roar) - What is up? - It's crazy down on the Capentry spot. Is that the boy over there from Violet-road, who has carved our cave? - Red Wolf and his gang? - Yes! Come on! Wait here. - All is calm, Red Wolf. - It's nice. Then we'll have a smoke. - May I not be free? - No, you don't! Who has toothpicks? Can you come out! It's our cave, and here must not be smoked! What's wrong with you? Throw him out! Out with him! (indian shout) You stole my cigaretes! Bring my cigarettes! Get them yourself! Two against one, that's cowardly! Ouch, don't do that! Help! Someone's coming! Can you get out! Cursed kids! Uh, good day, Mr. Peterson. - Yes, it's good with you! - And what kind of trouble is that? - There is no ruckus here. Nah, isn't there And cigarettes! Are you crazy, boy? Don't you know it's forbidden? It can be flammable. And here, where there are thousands of crowns of carpentry! If it happens again, it's the end of holding cave here! Yes, Mr. Peterson. - Well, you're good. Arrow off with you. - Thank you, Mr. Peterson. when I sit here at my piano it's like a miracle happens there are no more stupid lessons into dreamland, I see all girls' hearts dream to music tone things and tender ones in a girl's gaze we go round and long for romance even my little heart says dik-dik Dik-dik, dik-dik. - Oh no, Peter! What do you want? - Is Sis at home? - Nah, she's in town. - I should have spoken to her. Was it something special? Yes, you understand, it's the birthday party next Sunday. - I can't come. - That will make Sis very sad. Well, that's the exam. I have it hanging just above my head, only 3 weeks. - Ouch. - Yes, right? Peter? Yes? There's something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time. Sit down. - Now you won't be mad at me, will you? - No, no. Come on with it. I'm seriously afraid it will never work out with you and Sis. - What? - You care about her, don't you? - Yes, you are crazy! Crazy thing to ask. - Then you must show it some more. Lately she walks around and sighs like a little gray mouse. - What is she doing? - She needs care, Peter. - Did she complain? - No, Sis will never do that. But you know how romantic she is. In the cinema she only sees plays, - - where the hero brings flowers, kisses hands and sings serenades. Yes, I'm only studying to be a doctor. But I could send Sis some flowers. - Yes! And a poem! - I can't put two lines together! Wait a little, then you can borrow my poetry book. Here is one, that is so beautiful! "Every time you look at this cloth, think about it, it's been sitting there." Honestly, do you think it's something? No, not that, there's that on the other side, the thing with the rose. "You are like a flower, a rose so red..." (the clock strikes) Is the clock so many? I'm going out to drive with a child. - A child? - Yes, a little baby. I get a crown for half an hour. Ole runs with morning bread. - And Little Per also earns money. - For what? Uncle Anders will have a present. And uncle Sofus. They each get a cane with a silver fitting and name. It was great, huh? Well, I'm running away. Goodbye, Mie. You are a sweet girl. And thanks for the advice. Thanks yourself. Hey, Mie. What are you doing here lazying off? Haven't you earned anything today? - Nah, it's hard. - So pull yourself together, man! We're just waiting for a babysitter. I can't understand where she is, she was supposed to be here 15 mins ago. What do you do, what do you do? - Sorry, couldn't I help you? - No, I don't think so. Hey, isn't that you, whose name is Per and who lives here on the next road? - Do you know Grethe, my little daughter? - Nah. - She is having a cold, you understand. - Is she very sick? It's just a cough. Can't you sit with her until the babysitter comes? - Of course, I can. - That's nice. Come here, young man. - Karin? - Yes, has miss. Moeller come? No, but the boy here wants to stay with Grethe as long. Well Max, he's way too small! I'm not little, I'm outgrowing all my clothes! Yes, he can do that just fine. Here you go my boy, here you have a two-crown. And can you then use it for something sensible. - That's it, I'm going. - Good. Yes. Yes. Come here, little friend. Well, you'll see, Grethe, I have a little cavalier for you, - - who will be here for Ms. Moeller is coming. Come on, Karin. And so you take good care of the whole thing, don't you? I will. - Good night, little darling. - Good night. - What's your name? - Per. Come and sit here. - Do you speak Norwegian? - Yes. - So you are from Norway. - Yes. I probably thought so. I'm hungry. So am I. I'm always hungry. Okay dokey! Whoa, what's that to you? Where are you going? Just come! Just come. Awra! What a nice kitchen! And with radio! Yes, let's have some music. Can you take what you want like that? - No, but they're not home. - Well, no. - May I take this here? - Yes, be so good. Be so good, just eat. Do you like meat cakes? Meat cakes? We say meatballs. Just her, Ms. Moeller did not come. What is it? She rang the doorbell, but you didn't hear it! Did she go again? - Yes. Then I'll stay here with you. Cheers! - Well, let's play. - We say 'play.' - Play? - Yes. uh, where we are going to play really huje-hehe just run around and make fun danse rock and roll jeg dare to say 'darnit' here is no one we will ask for permission now I am a ship in a mighty storm I'm your stewardess in uniform ih, where shall we play and the whole house ours there are no limits to what we can do Now you can just swing your ponytail do whatever you want, I'll play along here you will see me go down on my final no don't do that and come and come here ih, how we will play the flags will be raised so people can see that this is your party up in the gold carriage blow in the trumpet now you are a rider pretty at horseback you are my princess, sweet and fine, the robe is of real stout ih, where shall we play, see where I can neigh I can bow as fast as a penguin I speak Norwegian, I can also speak it how do you like to ski? we speed down the steep hill of the mountain lots of snow, we can enjoy it what are we going to play now? redhead against the bleach? I'd rather play father and mother no, now we want to make a zoo I see you a lion wild and big no, we're going back to the land of Denmark sails through the smooth waters of the strait ih, how we should play, real huje-heje there are no limits to what we can do (it thunders) It's thundering, it's thundering! Just let it thunder... Th-th-there is no-no-nothing to be a-a-a-afraid of. Ahh! Come on! It's good that you're here, Per. It's thundering, then you need a man. I'll probably look after you, little Grethe. - Oh, what was that? - A short circuit. Wait a little. Now you will see! It is dark in all the houses. Ah, yes! So it's a short circuit. Yes, I know where there is a candle. Light it, Per. - It's quite nice, isn't it? - Yeah. - I think I'm going to the basement. - In the basement? We don't hear the ratchets there. Well, no, we'll see you free of that spectacle. Help! What should we do? The lightning must have struck somewhere. - There are no lights in the entire district. - They don't answer the phone. It was strange. Mrs. Moeller must be there. And Grethe, who is so afraid of thunderstorms... - That was a shame. - Then we'd better go home. I hope, They can come again, if everything is in order. - Farewell so long. - See you again. - There's still no light. - I know where there is a light. Mrs. Moeller! - No, she's not here. - Where could she be? - Oh, there came the light. - Where could they be? Grethe! The door is open to the basement. Maybe they are down there. Grethe! I thought I heard something inside from the boiler room. - There is no one here. - Yes, it was strange. (The children giggles) Yes, here we are! - Ih, how it is pretty! - Yes, it's nice, huh? - Why do you raise the flag? - When you are happy for something or other. You know what, little Ole? Then we don't lift it often enough. It's only on flag days and birthdays and stuff like that. - What is flag days? - Take and slap the geels shut! - Do you think I'm an encyclopedia? - A what for something? - Where is Mie? - Inside in the kitchen, I think. You are good, Mie. Get up and get ready, and tell the boys that too. - Just they're tender. - They look delicious. How sweet it was of your father to invite me along. I'm so glad you are helping me. - Maybe your young man will come too? - Peter? Nah, he doesn't have time. Listen little Sis, I don't think so, They look really happy. I'm just a little nervous. Uncle Sofus is so difficult. - Oh? Is he married, by the way? - Nah, he's a bachelor. That's why then! My late husband was so difficult and obstinate when he was alone. Then he got married to me, and then it was over. - He became pious like a lamb. - Yes, I would like to believe that! That's quite a portion, huh? I've lost over three pounds. Yes, shrimp and picnic go together. It was father's idea that the day should be celebrated that way. He rejoices like a little child. He is a lovely person, your father. Always so gentle and so kind and gentle. Aarh! Such a... Bah! Well, where did it go? Ole! Mie! Per! Come and help me! - What are you doing? - Is there anything wrong, little father? I've lost my collar button. Help me find it! We probably will. Where is it located? Yes, if I knew that, I could take it myself, right? Well, you don't have to talk so loudly, little father. There, there, there... Yes, I was standing here, suddenly it was gone. - We'll find it. - Can't you take another collar button? It was the only one I had. Mie, can you crawl over to the other side? So, Per, further over... Spit it out! Now spit it out, little Jensen. - There it is! - Hooray, Jensen found it! - Here you go, little father. - Thanks a lot, my boy. - It was good, it didn't swallow it. - Then we had a dangerous mess! So you'll see, there's the schabang. - The Shabang? - Yes, bang-bang-bang-bang! - Is that you, there shell in the woods? - Yes, it's right, whatever it is. Only the weather holds. - Don't you think so? - Nah. With flat hands, man! Otherwise, there might go a finger. It tickles! Do you know what? The driver says that the weather may not hold. I could probably imagine that! - So he can't be familiar with that. - Well, I know a good remedy. We should all just take umbrellas with us, so nothing will happen. - Have you remembered the gifts? - No. - Good day, Mrs. Sejersen. - Good day. - Has the birthday boys come? - No, but there are five minutes left. - Have we got it all now? - Yes, and you can believe, I am glad. There was something I wanted to remember... Now what was it? - My sunglasses. - Well father, they are upstairs! Well, yes... because I finally have to bring my sunglasses. As long as it rains, it doesn't dust. Yes, great idea! That was a brilliant idea! If you therefore need a plunge bath. It's probably just a small shower. - Won't you remove that dog? - It doesn't bite. Unfortunately. Nah, but it sheds. Aw, come to me, Jensen, you're welcome here. Well, now the rain stopped. Yes, and now the sun is coming! - Welcome to the woods! - Thanks. I have thought that the lordship could sit here. So you must think again, one can't due to mosquitoes. My pardon, they can also sit inside. I can sit exactly, where it suits me. Be preserved, be preserved! That's the way. - No, look there! - Yes, it's a swing! - I saw it first! - Wait for me! - Only it can hold now. - Ork, yes. My stomach is tingling. Better get out in the fresh air. There's no way to breath! - So don't try it! - Now stop snarling at each other. We eat here outside and go for a walk, while the table is set. Let's hurry and get the food on the table in a hurry. Mie, come and help us. Good food makes the mind happy, ha, ha! Listen here, uncle Anders... No, I don't want to! Why does he always have to tease? Well, let him... Now come here, Uncle Sofus, and make peace. We would like to have a nice afternoon. You are, after all, brothers... Even twins! Well, I was born first! Go ahead and to come closer. Mie has a little gift for the birthday children. A gift? That sounds good. Now you are both seventy, and so we have written a verse, - - and while the eyes sparkles, we salute you two dear uncles. We wish you luck and a happy return - - from father and his four children. Here you go, uncle Anders. - What could it be? - It's a cane! Yes, it certainly is! And with name on! Aah, that's it, I've always wanted to. Congratulations, Uncle Sofus. It's for you. - You are also a cane! - Well, thank you all. I never walk with a cane. That's it, I say: He's a stupid slug. Yes, we could have saved that. Can't we exchange it and get the money back? Yes, we could do that. I sit here with the shrimp! Wait a little, honey, Uncle Sofus came first. Here you go. - Uncle Anders, you take Mrs. Sejersen. - Take and take! Ho, ho! Here you go, uncle Sofus, lovely freshly peeled prawns. Otherwise, if I have shrimp, I want to peel them myself! - A beer, sir? - I'll have fresh pineapple juice. Unfortunately, we don't have that. I probably thought so. Such a country! I say, what a country! - What's that for? - It's your chickens, freshly fried. Should I finally have poultry, it will be turkeys from my own farm in Texas. I always have a 6-700 going like that. Do you know, how much does it cost me in dollars? I say, do you know, what does it cost?! No, but I know what this breakfast costs dad. We don't have a farm, and we don't have much money, but we have each other. But there is nothing, there is good enough for you. Gosh, Sis! Sorry, little father, but I've been up since half past seven this morning, - - and I think we've arranged it so nicely, and he's so undeletable! - No, I can't do it anymore! - But, child! Sis! You made Sis cry. You should be ashamed, should you. - It is true what Ole says. - Yes? What does he say? He says that you are a stupid snail. That was too much! We don't want you for uncle. - Oh, don't you want that? - Nah, you're a real badass. So there is never anyone who has dared to speak to me like that before! No, because they don't have the courage to do it! You would rather go home. - Am I really that slimy? - Yes. Yes, it could well be, you're right. Well, you've gone and become an old, egotistical weirdo. - A real gnawing potty. - A super goat. Yes, you can actually say that. You've been so busy scraping money together that you've become lonely. - Don't you have any friends? - Well, honestly... It's a pity for you, Uncle Sofus. Do you think so, Little Per? Yes. - Have you never tried to smile? - What are you saying? Yes, have you never tried to smile? So test. - Try? - Yes, test it. No, look at me... like that! Yes, that's right! Now you look like Uncle Anders. Oh, free me from that. Aah, you little rascal! Shh, now the others are coming. Now eat your food and look happy. Sorry, Uncle Sofus. I'm sorry about that. Gossip and nonsense, my sweet girl. It was just me, there was a stupid snail! I say snail! Well, let me finally get that chicken. For the rest, I'd rather have the shrimp, they look so much better. Well, little Sofus! You're not sick, are you? No, on the contrary! I'm healthy as a fish! Sit down, and don't stand there and stare! We are out in the woods to have fun! The sun is shining, and the birds are singing, yes! Yes, and you're not really smart! - Cheers, father! - Cheers, Mie! Yahoo! out on the floor, everyone has a cowboy ball on the farm stand in a ring and make a run, it's your Texas swing girls, you lead, take a man under the arm turn around and see a run that's your Texas swing one and two and three and four l shall count with in chorus five and six and seven and eight such grandmom danced safe ball with gunpowder and bangs where the pianist is shot see he makes a mighty run, that's your Texas swing a square dance in the wild west must be danced with humor so stomp away like a horse and turn around like a foal Swing with a girl so she gets quite a bit older so let go of the one you have all men should switch girls when I play pingeling it's Texas swing hop around merrily again you must sing and whistle turn around and then a jump that's your Texas swing one and two and three and four we shall count with in choir five and six and seven and eight, such grandmom danced hang on now and beat y'all loose, dance with the treasure all night just remember that little jump, that's your Texas swing it's Texas swing! We can't do that better at home in Texas. What is it? There is someone who has drunk my champagne. - Who would it be? - Such nonsense! No, look there! Jensen, you're drunk! Wait for me! Huh! Hey! Excuse me. Be careful, you can get used to it. I say, Little Per, today you don't have a dog with you. No, it wasn't doing so well this morning. - Oh? Is it sick? - No, it is hung over. Well, well... Hung over? - Yes, come in. - Thanks. Am I disturbing, Principal? - Nah no, just come closer. - Thanks. It was about the school comedy. Well, it's coming soon. What are we going to play? 'Once upon a time.' Oh! This year we are competing with the Royal Theatre! They put soul in as usual? Yes, I do. I have intended to distribute the roles today. - Well, that's good, they do that. - Thanks. I've got a piece of fish fillet. There is nothing as nice as the packed lunch the day after a party. Have you heard, we're going to play 'Once upon a Time?' Yes, I have known that for a long time. Is there not one of you who wants to change? I've got a piece of rock and roll polish. I'd like that, but not with chicken. Then I grab it with the banana. What are you scurrying down here for, you little snake? - We sat and talked about the school comedy. - It could be, you should join. Last year they used some of the little ones as extras. Is there something about Indians? - Are you sore, man. It's your 'Once upon a time.' - What for something? - There was even what for something? - Aarh, you little chatterbox! Now you're going to hear, Little Per, it's a piece of theater from the old days, - - and it's about a princess, who is young and beautiful, but very important. Oh? What is she important to? That you care to explain something to the little original! Shut up now! So, Per, the princess is young and very beautiful. - Then it should be Sis. - Sis doesn't go to school. - Think, if it was me. - If only it doesn't happen to her, Birthe. So, that's what I'm saying, if she gets the part, I'll die! (it is ringing) So for the evening! Shhh! Many thanks, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, as you surely know, this year we will play 'Once Upon a Time' - - by Holger Drachmann. I have the deepest sympathy for the deceased poet, - - but we must do our best. Ole, come here. After careful consideration, we have assigned you the role of the prince. - Here you go, Your Royal Highness. - Ooh, thanks. Do you now think you can learn the big role? Ork yes, when it's something like that, it's about! Yes, I thought so. Torben, here we have Kasper Roeghat for you. There are great traditions to live up to. - Many thanks. - You're welcome. And what have we seen.... Yes, Mie! - Me? - Yes. - Here are the fade bursters, dear. - Thanks. It's not a big role, but there is a good song. Birthe, you shall be princess of Illyria, - - who gets married to a coal miner. - Fuck it! - Can you hold on to mine? There you are, Lars. He will play the king. It's good. Thanks. Tell me more, Uncle Sofus. You got there, where you met the bear. Right! It was the biggest and most furious bear I have ever seen. I crept along the edge of the forest... Roar! There was a roar and a bang, there it was right in front of me! What then? I slowly raised my weapon and took aim. - Did you hit it? - No. The gun cracked. Darn it! What did you do so? - I ran, just as fast as I could. - What about the the bear? He set off after me in a violent run. It was about to reach me. I could feel its warm breath on my neck. - No! - Yeah. Then there was a hiss, and a feathered arrow hit the bear right in the heart. There it lay! Dead! Oh? Where did that arrow come from? - Well, it was a Cherokee. - What kind of one is it? It was such an Indian. He saved my life. - So they are good people? - Yes, you can believe that, you guys! - Then you can enjoy traveling over there. - Could you have liked it? - Yes, you are very clever, Uncle Sofus! - Maybe it was an idea. Shh .. I hear hoofbeats over the prairie. - Mie! - Yes. Come over here. What is wrong? It became someone else, who got the role of the princess in the school comedy. If only it had been Jette or Hanne or one of the others. - But her Birthe! - We'll probably have to redo that. Nah, it's too late. I even know the whole role, I was so sure of getting it. Shouldn't you play along? Well, the fade burster, a kind of cook's maid. You will probably come to play that princess, - - if I'm going to buy the whole school! What can such a school stand for in dollars? You can't do that, Uncle Sofus. It's a municipal school! Keep your money, Uncle Sofus. I think I have a much better idea. Have you? I guess you're getting wiser, little man. Don't you think little men can think? Just wait! Ho, ho, ho! - Here you go. - Thanks. Oh, how beautiful they are! Red roses! Who are they from? They are from Peter. He can't afford to do that. Why does he think of it now! Yes, it is not good to know. What is he writing? You are like a flower, a rose so red, and I love you because you are sweet. How beautiful it is. I didn't know, he was so romantic. I knew that very well. (the phone is ringing) Now I'm going! Hello? I thought so it was you, Peter. Yes, the roses have arrived. I definitely think they worked. So she was happy for them? Then it worked! Nah, hoof, hoof! You won't get away with that. Now comes the next item on the program. No, Mia! I would be a complete laughing stock. Nah, you are wrong there... Well, what was it I wanted to say? Trallalalla, trallalallaa. That's a deal, right? - Who was that? - That? Nah, that! There was only one, I spoke to. We go from there, where the princess is sorry, - - because the prince has gone. I am the prince, and now I go. - I have gone! - Yes. Yes! Woe is me! Gone! So hear me, stay! Come back! He doesn't hear me, only gnawing branches call his way. Could I take him in my arms, - - tug him, I wanted to sob and complain! Cry with him my court would. Lay my cheek to his chest - - and smile of light under all my weep! Help me God... Listen, what noice! Is that him? Is that them? Now one of the branches breaks forth, it's him! - Catherine! - Yes? Where should I hide? They are coming! - Who? Who? - The hunters! The guard! (Jensen barks) Nah, listen now... What on earth is going on here? We only try to play comedy. - Better play in bed. - Aarh, now we were off to a good start! Yes, she will be so good. Per! You know, you must not use profanity. No, but she's going to be so... She's going to be so hot. Yes, you are good. Good night, Mie. - Good night, father. - And sat up in bed with you. Such. - Good night, little one, sweet father. - Yes, you're good, you owl! Thanks for loan. - You never get that role. - You don't know anything about that. So much can happen, you've heard that so often. - Have a good night and sleep well. - Night, night. Everything is dark there. - Is it a bet? - No, it's a serenade. - Romeo and Juliet... - Where is the balcony? It's not funny at all, this! - We wake up the whole neighborhood! - Yes, so what? Thing... in the serenade to you I have saved a prayer now listen to the play of the strings the night saw the shoe and the moon will dance tonight time will stand still tonight we two wil dream among the swarm of stars don't get dizzy my dear the world will smile tonight no one wants to rest tonight everything becomes enchanted at midnight kiss me on the mouth tonight the rocking stream of tones has such a strong power close your eyes and dreams but be careful now the moon will dance tonight time will stand still tonight we two wil dream among the swarm of stars don't get dizzy my dear the world will smile tonight no one wants to rest tonight everything becomes enchanted at midnight kiss me on the mouth tonight (clap) Sis!

Take that and move it! Not before you've retrieved the doll. - What kind of doll? - The one, you threw up in the tree. Aarh, take care of yourself! Up with you! Don't worry, little Grethe, now you're getting your baby again. Thank you, Per. You are so kind. - Here! - Thanks. I didn't think you were excited about dolls, you boy! - You will get paid for that! - You must have many thanks. You must think you're funny. Hey! Your shoelace is untied.

It was, if I may say so, invigorating! I'll come in a bit, I want to see the scene between the three suitors and the princess. Is it for the rest true that all the costumes have arrived? Yes, yes, it's in your words. Please, ladies, please. Is your princess ready? Aah, where are you now my crown? I had it just before... Is there anyone who has seen a crown? No, but you can borrow fifty cents from me. Stop standing there laughing stupidly, you little fool! Here I am. How do I look? - Well done! - Beautiful. But a princess without a crown, it doesn't work! It has been lost. Then go and dig in the crown jewels, Your Royal Highness. - Yes, please. - Thanks. You should have a box with some fans. Can you find it? Birthe! - Here is your crown, Birthe. - Where did it come from? - It was under a lid. - To think, did it? - Yes. - And you didn't know anything about that? Do you think it was me who hid it? - Yes, exactly. - Why would I have done that? Because I play the princess. They are sour, said the raeven about the the ron bearers. Mie, I will whisper something to you. She will get paid for that! Just wait and see. I would say, I would hurry! Come on, Ole! - What is it, you have there? - nothing. Can I see? Sneeze powder. What are you going to use it for? - Nothing to do. - Well... Hurry up now. Will it come to anything? All up on the stage, so we can see the costumes. And get started... Come on! Take care, ladies... My gloves! And my pocketbook! It has just been here. - May I get the stickied this beard on? - Yes, yes, right away, little friend. Aah, where am I nervous! I'm all hot with nervousness. Birthe, will you come? Yes, I'm done. I would have the crown on. Take it in your hand, and take it up there, right? - Whoa, wait a minute. - What do you want? You lost your pocketbook, little Birthe. Come here with it! Birthe! Come on, and get the beard on! Be careful on the stairs. Help her a little there, right? And you sit on the throne next to your venerable father. Do the ladies have their fans? Can I see? Yes, you are good... Where is the village guard? Per? Yes, yes, many thanks. Do you want to gallop up the stairs? But without falling! - Come on, old comrade. - He forgot his lance. Well, it won't work. Here you go, my lord. Ouch! Hold it. You must be very sorry. Here you go. - Thanks, you stupid kid! - Thanks yourself. Per! On the spot! Phew, how warm it is! Then we start over. First suiter enters. Everyone be quiet! (sneezes) - How cold that child is! - Get sneezed off so we can start. Now, let's get started, and let's begin to move forward. (everyone sneezes violently) Per? Come here, Birthe. You are infecting everyone else. I felt so good this morning... Yes, yes, you don't have that now. Mrs. Ludvigsen! Won't you be happy to bring her home to bed? Yes, I will. - Get well soon, my girl. - Yes, what do we do now? Well, we'll have to give up the premiere tomorrow. Excuse me, couldn't another girl play the princess? No, Little Per, princesses don't hang on trees. Oh, no... What would they also want to be there for? Mie knows the whole role by heart. Is that right, Mie? Yes, we have the book at home. Don't you want to try me? - I know the role. - Well, let's try her. Good, noble lady, on the throne. Well, it's not the right clothes! Don't worry about it. Tomorrow you are dressed as a princess of Illyria. Princess! I am from a country where the language on the tongue easily puts a melody, - - as soon as the ship's spring power, the team runs in happy amazement - - or beats it with sad melancholy. Struck here I stand by your beauty, - - and when my drunk eye surrounds this beautiful hair, - - the red mouth that spares against its will - - a bold suitor thirst his welcome grape, - - while I paint here the bow of the oval and these fine brows, which gently bow, - - then I don't know myself, how it goes, - - but the words of the language must be combined with music. He's good, huh? - Yes, he's really going to... - Shhh! We don't play Shrove Tuesday. Are you noble or bourgeois? Civil servant or officer? Do you have a farm or estate? Hurry up! My father is of nobility, old and good. There flows in my veins the blood of a few ancestors. An office awaits me, God give me understanding, - - I court the princess as prince of the land of Denmark. Well done, well done! Take him! Are you sure no one is home? They are all together at to see that awful school comedy. - How do we get hold of the dog? - Just let me. Per goes crazy when he discovers that Jensen is away. Yes, he's totally crazy about that dog. Come on! On it! Ouch! It bites! - They should be here now. - I don't like it. There they are! - Who has the bone? - Here. - May I not give it that? - No. - Why must it not come out? - Because it bites. And then we'll have a smoke. May I not be free? I got so sick last time. Well you don't. We don't need sissies! Scrub home in bed! Home to mother and have baby bottle and diaper on! - He's coming this way! - The guard? We're running away! Turn off the light! (Jensen squeals) I have never had so much fun as when Little Per came riding in! What a cowboy he could be! It was a lovely evening. Many thanks, everyone! Well, it's not over, little Mrs. Sejersen. Sis has a couple of snacks and a glass of beer. Yes, aren't you going in, Mrs. Sejersen? Yes, thank you. Can you run in advance and open up? Sis, aren't you sorry that I don't go with you? No, I understand well, you're going home and reading. That exam means so much for us two, right? Yes. Goodbye, you. Goodbye, Sis. Jensen! Jensen? Jensen! Jensen, where are you? I don't know what to do, I can't find Jensen. You can just walk around looking for it. It's your dog. Jensen! Jensen! What is that? Well, like that... Where is Jensen? Can you answer me? - I can't do better than that. - For what? - That they have put him in a sack. - Where? Down in the cave. On the carpentry square. Jensen! Jensen! Little Jensen, what have they done to you? Are you out of your mind, boy? What are you doing here? I haven't done anything! - Well, not that? - No, I haven't! Now shut your mouth and come along! Now you keep calm. Will you give me the fire department. Lyngby, yes. Is that the fire department? It's from Moeller's Carpenty. It burns! They must come at once. It will be an expensive story for your father! You little rascal! Hello? Uncle Sofus? You mustn't tell the others, but it's horribly crazy! Well, well... Yes, Mr. Director, what can I help you with? Yes, can't you come and pay some fireworks for me? Yes, with great pleasure, Mr. director. Where are you her? I'm here, you should just go after the fire shade. Hello? Who was that? It was just a small business connection. I'll be back in a moment. Well? Ole, do you know where Little Per is? - No, he has suddenly vanished. - Come on! Can you see a firestorm? Yes, over there at carpentry square. It burns! Yes... Come! - You're crazy. - We have to get the dog! Are you crazy? Then they just discover, it's us. Us! Nah, you, Bent! I saw myself, you threw a cigarette. - Well, I didn't! - Well, you did so! Yes, you did! - Shouldn't we run away? - Why that? We are allowed to stand here and watch a fire. There we have him. I want to talk to the boy alone. Oh. Come here. - Good evening. - Good evening. Well, shall we see how it goes together? - And so we only tell the truth. - I always do. It was good. Let's hear. - There you are, my boy! - Good evening. - Your the boy's father? - Unfortunately, I'm only his uncle. Tell me, what will such a conflagration cost in dollars? - Yes, it will be an expensive story. - It's not me who did it! Who is it then? Do you know who it is? Who it then? Well! Per don't want to rat, you can probably understand. You are good, my boy, you are a real man! Now we must have clarified who is guilty. You can figure that out yourself! That's it, we have the police for! I say, that's it, we have the police! Excuse me, may I have permission to ask my brother about something? Well yes, go ahead. Bent and his gang. No! I saw him just out on the road before. May we be allowed to leave for a moment? We'll be right back. On our honor. - Go ahead. - Come on! There's Per! I have something I want to talk to you about! - I haven't done anything! - Well, you haven't? It's from Jensen, and it's from me! - I want to go home! - You stay here! - The police want to talk to you. - The police? Yes, about the fire and about you teaching the little ones to smoke cigarettes. You would have some scratch, you should! Yes, a couple on the forehead! We got him! Bent would like to tell, who is to blame for the fire. It's me. Sit down, Anders. I have something serious to talk to you about. You also look completely dignified. Sofus wants Little Per with him to America. Nah! Then he gets a long nose, because you don't agree to that. Or do you go? I don't know soon. All night I thought and thought. He won't keep him over there, will he? Well, that's exactly what he wants. He also has no one to leave it all to. All his horses and cows... and turkeys! - And all the many money. - Exactly. And are we allowed to stand in the way of his happiness? Nah, no, no, dear friend. And if he doesn't like it over there, he can just come home again. - Yes, that's it too, Sis says. - Yes. Yes. - When does he travel? - They sail in a couple of weeks. Yes... I will now come to miss the little fellow... Yes, we all want that. What does he himself say to that? You know, boys! They just seem it's so interesting, right? Yes. My uncle's farm is as big as all of Zealand, - - and there are many thousands of cattle. - Are there cowboys there too? - Ork yes, and Indians. I get to ride my own horse. Uh! - You should learn how to throw with a lasso. - I can. - Well, you can't! - Well I can say! Now I will show you. Move a little. Ahhh! Oh, you almighty! It was fun! Not either, Mrs. Sejersen? Well, yes. You are a real little rascal, are you! I got such a shock! You must not do that a second time. Uncle Sofus taught me that. Yes, it wouldn't surprise me anyway. - Huh! - Hello. I'm so worried you travel, Per. Are you sad about it? Why is that? Then we'll probably never see each other again. Yes, I'll come and pick you up when I grow up. - When will you grow up? - In twenty years, I reckon. By the way, I have a ring for you. Oh, how lovely you are, Per! Are we engaged, Per? The engagement? Yes, you can say that. - Is it a real diamond? - Yes, I really hope so. I have given over a crown for it. Well, I must go on. You look so handsome in those clothes, Per. Yes, I got them from my uncle. He gives us all so many gifts. - Goodbye, you. - Goodbye. - No! Look, they're throwing streamers! - Ah yes! - Per he can. - Lend me to your pocketbook. - Ow! Girls should always hoot. - How will he fare? He can't speak English, and so can all the other children over there. He will learn that soon. I don't like, he shall travel. He is so small... He'll be fine, you'll see. He is a real man. - I will probably write home to you! - Yes, we'll write! - It's good. - Yes, it works! Well, Little Per, now they're probably taking the gangway. - Is the ship sailing like that? - Yes. Then we must wave goodbye. Per! Father! I don't want to leave you! I don't want to leave you. - Well, Per! - Little darling. You shall not cry, my little boy, there is nothing to cry for! - Are you really smart, man? - It was good, he landed. You shouldn't be sad about it, Uncle Sofus. I'll come over to you when I grow up! So hurry up and grow! See you! See you soon! --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
