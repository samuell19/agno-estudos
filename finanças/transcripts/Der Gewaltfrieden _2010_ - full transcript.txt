Dictated Peace Part 2 The Legend of the Stab in the Back and the Treaty of Versailles For the press conference as well? - You said it, governor. It serves them both right, Liebknecht and also Luxemburg and Germany God knows, has other problems, colleague. Who actually dictates your articles? General Luettwitz, Captain Pabst or the stab in the back legend creator, Karl Helfferich himself, Grabowski? Ha, there are still a few missing. Keep up. Gentlemen, the Foreign Minister, Count Brockdorf-Rantzau. Berlin, Foreign Ministry. 17 January 1919 Gentlemen, please sit down. The German Armistice Commission starts negotiations today in Trier with representatives of the Entente on an extension of the armistice. On this occasion it was right to ask you to come here. Thank you for such large numbers. For what's published I need your help. I need you to get across, because I care about it. To say among the German people that we have no reason to despair if we find in ourselves the strength to go to the final peace negotiations as a united people. Our policy, is a policy of reconciliation with foreign countries. A policy that will bring us a genuine, breath of life suffused, association of nations. But it takes certain qualities to become a member of this League of Nations. The moral readiness and conviction of everyone involved not of just the German nation. And we are fighting, of course for an ultimate victory for democracy. And we will not be able to achieve this victory if we continue to practice the mean spirited ways of the old failed system, such as scheming politics and underhand deals. At last a straight talker. Trier, Train Station Because of the failure to comply with the agreed armistice terms. Specifically due to the delayed delivery of 500 locomotives and 1,900 wagons. Marshal Foch demands, an additional penalty delivery of 58,000 pieces agricultural machines like the latest type for steam ploughing for example, while still demanding the delivery of all U-boats with an end to further U-boat construction. Restitution for material carried off from northern France and Belgium within 24 hours. The subordination of the German merchant fleet, for the purpose of food supply to Germany and Europe. The entire merchant fleet? Think about this. This fleet is in private hands. It's about supplying your civilian population and your women and children. - Why don't you lift your blockade? Et pourquoi ne levez-vous pas votre blocus? Then, when signing the article, simply put the following sentence before your name, Herr Erzberger. "The German Government takes note of Marshal Foch's prior understanding but declares they are impractical." Reich Chancellor, Herr Ebert. Are you still there? Hung up again. Journeyman saddler. What do you expect? But not a word that, regarding the extension, I could refuse. And the Allies will march in if we don't provide the fleet. I told him as you well heard. But this government fills its trousers before it breaks on the wheel. Then signs, without even ifs, or buts. Berlin, Wedding, Woellke Residence. Where have you been, Son. At work, don't worry. All I have is worry. The murder of Rosa and Karl cries out for vengeance. Son, people like Liebknecht and Luxemburg, who start civil war have to expect to die. Ah, those murdered are to blame? Why don't you say that, Mother? Ebert and Scheidemann are the worker murderers. And now blood is flowing again. And again and again. Though it won't be flowing in vain, Mother. New Prussian Newspaper (Cross Newspaper) Moral convictions. Don't make me laugh, Rantzau and morals. Scheming politics, underhand deals. Says this head of the Foreign Office, which is full of schemers. If anything, for us to know best about this shameless tattooed morphine addict, we should believe them. If it will deceive, perhaps Wilson or Lloyd George or Clemenceau, Rantzau behaves like an old top dog, who wants to establish himself among the others, in his junior chamber. You talk of mistakes. Mistakes of this desperate government that is struggling for the good of Germany whose only mistake was that of appointing you Armistice Commissioner. You had clear orders not to sign without the addition. The entire merchant fleet! Do you have any idea? You know as well as me that the German people in two months would starve if I hadn't signed. Because instead of negotiating you caved in. If you want to be snippy you are welcome to continue the negotiations Minister. You can count on it. This lowly man is late home with his empty belly and full moon bottom. No wonder the Entente doesn't take him seriously. He doesn't say a word then tells us afterwards. What? It's true, Gentlemen. They are traitors of the working class. You get so worked up, Son. You just stick to yours. Eat, here. Potatoes and turnips yet again. I couldn't get anything else. You have to queue up for ages. And we're still expected to guard these criminals. You should shoot them. - You should look around for work. Who knows how long they'll keep you sailors... I have work, Mother. We are still government forces. We drove out the Kaiser. We were called and now we are staying until the revolution is finally triumphant. We owe it to Karl and Rosa. Thank heavens elections are Sunday. Then the whole thing must finally calm down. Calm down? Bugger the elections! Just read it, Ladies. The Ten Commandments of women's suffrage. First, you should take the unexpected and serious right, as a duty to be performed conscientiously. Second, you should mourn the good old days when women had it so much easier. Third, in politics you should not covet your neighbour's right. That's really in there? - It seems to be. Fourth you should have the courage of conviction but not the stubbornness of fanaticism. That one wasn't written by a fool. - Unfortunately that one's not there. Berlin, Reich Chancellery 20 January 1919 Friends the election result has not brought us Sozial Demokrats the expected approval. 38%, that is a catastrophe. We have to unite, and make an offer to our USPD comrades. Over my dead body, Fritz. And besides they're still not right. Notwithstanding rejecting the offer anyway. Like it or not, we must ask Herr Erzberger and his Catholic Zentrums. Yes, we need a strong government that will withstand all this pressure, from the Allies to the Poles and Bolsheviks. Then we need to get even the Demokratic Party on-board. Accepted. Phillip you will become Chancellor. Or let's call it Prime Minister of the Reich. You Gustav the Defence Minister and you Gustav-Adolf, Trade Minister. and Erzberger we'll make Minister without Portfolio. And you? - You will make me Reich President. Reich President. Good. Where will we do the thing with the National Assembly? Berlin is just too insecure. - We go to Weimar. For me this thing is decided. Then now, we should really talk about our salaries. Yes. Social democrats. All money-grubbers. Only rich here. Their greatest concern was the higher salaries. As they now have to take responsibility and stick their necks out. Do you know what Ebert, this petty-bourgeois considers a reasonable salary? 100,000 Goldmarks a month. And he gets it? My father as a skilled worker at Borsig, earns less than 250. 100,000 was too much, even for his comrades. But he gets it annually anyway. - Unbelievable! That's still almost 8,500 a month. Another Egon, please. And add to this 500,000 Goldmarks for expenses related to his office. And with such men we are now to be governed. The General assembly of Workers and Soldiers Councils yesterday adopted the proposal to convene a Germany wide congress of councils which is facing a serious threat from the National Assembly. And it is to be expected that the present hostile majority in the government will try to eliminate the workers and soldiers councils. This would give the constitution of the new Germany a bourgeois-democratic foundation with no proletarian influence. And a civil war, between the Sozial Demokrat democratic Weimar government and a government of councils, backed by part of the army, our representatives and Spatakus, could hardly be avoided. So it means act. The government must be removed before it begins to govern. Whoever won't become a communist now, has not understood the signs of the times. Even if the uprising failed, and it's failure proved it to be a mistake, Spartakists are stronger than ever. They don't just have arms depots, money from Russia they have something the White murderers don't have, ideals. And the courage of those who have nothing to lose. I think your new magazine is just about these ideals and everything that Germans held dear until now is to be destroyed, Herzfelde. Jaded ideals, Count provide open space and clear air for new ideals. Hence, enough with these poems by Heine and Rike. Now it's time to generate electricity. Current that drives life. In our new magazine what's printed will be composed so it has to be thought provoking. How much do you need? Not more than 1000. For now. Not more? And how do you plan on selling your paper? The street vendor, soldiers, students. We have our people everywhere. Since that's policy. All right? Privy Councillor von Berger asks for a call back. He says Bremen is facing civil war. Very nice. - Thank you. You'll forgive me. - Please. Yes events are falling over themselves. Spartakists for Weimar have put forward the Honour Company of Reinhard's Regiment. They are supposed to guard the National Assembly. Unarmed. And now? From Noske, again leave weapons. I've never seen in German politics, except possibly by the Kaiser, such a shocking lack of understanding as to how events are connected. But that's why I don't want to talk to them. - A glass of wine? Award winning Luisa Schorsch. - Gladly. The communist uprising is not only planned for Bremen. They have sent their shop stewards, furnished with military travel warrants, throughout the country in order to transfer men to Berlin in small squads of 2 - 6 in order to pounce on 6 February. For me the roast. - Certainly. Excellent wine. And what will you do now? - Me? Huh, nothing. This is a matter for our precious government, but I would ask you to stay at home for the next few days. This is according to my knowledge, the situation. I am strictly opposed to further cooperation with the Sozial Demokrats. Director General, we still need the Sozis until Spartakism and Bolshevism is finally eliminated. Pabst is right. The events in Bremen are the best proof. Why, General Luettwitz? - The bandit councillors in Bremen in negotiations with our forces offered to relinquish power. They promise free elections. - That's no good. Elections, for us are bollocks. And they even want to give up their weapons. But only to the Hamburg soldiers council. Our officers in Bremen are inclined to accept this. What! You must immediately forbid this, General. No need. - Our Sozial Demokrat Noske has forbidden them. He demands total surrender. But he knows the Bremen Bolsheviks can't do that. They don't want to lose the respect of their comrades and so he has, and we have, finally a reason to lash out and annihilate. So much for doing without our Sozial Demokrat friends in this, Herr Hugenberg. It goes against me nonetheless, having to cooperate with them. Not only you. The day will come when we also retire social democracy. Except for Noske, as dictator he could keep the workers in line for us. And Ebert possibly. Can you turn him around anyway? No no no, I hate them. Just like the Jews. Despite all justified anti-Semitism Professor Helfferich, on Jewish bankers we would not be able to do without the existing support of Director Generals Ottmar Strauss and Salomon Max. Money from Jews. Disgusting! Money has no smell. - Ha, that was so Jewish. Absolutely sickening! If the Director General could get more money from Aryan banks especially from your Deutsch Bank then then they certainly wouldn't have been there. Unfortunately the cash flow is not as we would like it to be. Those of us on the board have concerns doing this. On the board of Deutsch Bank or your German National Party, Professor Helfferich. Unfortunately both. - Why this reluctance everywhere? The party officially, does not want anything to do with it. And unofficially? - Fully aware, we want to take power. Nevertheless, it is necessary to exercise caution. And I would say, also wait in relation to Erzberger. Anyway, he obtained a pass especially for my fiance from Wiesbaden. So she was able to leave the French occupied zone and marry me here in Berlin. We should put the personal on the back burner in here, Captain Pabst. Erzberger is the biggest of all the November criminals. Erzberger has to go. - And as you know they will make sure. Upon which we should drink. Even though the comrades in Bremen wanted to drop off their weapons. Just shot to pieces. If Noske and Ebert want civil war, they can and should have it. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Government of the Reich I welcome you to the constitutional National Assembly of the German Nation. I particularly warmly welcome the women who for the first time are here, as equals, in this chamber. Ladies and gentlemen, it was the Imperial government of Prince Max von Baden that ushered in the armistice that made us defenceless. Unprecedented! Quiet! After the collapse of our allies, economy and military situation they could not do otherwise. - Could? They wanted to! - Boo! The revolution rejects responsibility for the failed policies of the old powers and the reckless arrogance of the military which condemned the German people to misery. They are also responsible for our great food emergency. But the war also exhausted our opponents. From exhaustion sprang our opponent's notion of safeguarding themselves from the German people. These vengeful and degrading plans demand challenging keenly. Don't put before us the fatal choice between starvation and being defenceless. Even a socialist people's government must hold on to this. Better the worst of deprivation than obliteration. Trusting President Wilson Germany has laid down its arms. Now give us Wilson's treaty. Can this Ebert give us such hope? Unlike him I have seen the destruction caused by the German military in France and Belgium. I was, and still am against governing with these philistines. Don't forget that Ebert is also Catholic. The talk of the counter-revolution that the Independents and Spartakists lead would be not too wrong if ever there had been a real revolution in Germany... Grosz and Herzfelde are here. - Five minutes I just need to quickly finish this letter. - I'll tell them. Your work is just fantastic, Grosz. But the text... Don't take this the wrong way, Herzfelde but instead of screams and tragedy humour and colour would probably communicate better. But that's how my employees want it. There was a proper revolt. They don't believe in the power of humour. According to these Spartakist morons, only weighty cudgels actually kill, Count. They are simply German through and through and completely humourless. Don't listen to him. Like it or not, I have to pay for the whole thing. And since I don't want to see you or Grosz or myself behind bars in Moabit. I want to ask you not to print the proclamation of the Bavarian council against White terror. Just support the magazine, and don't give advice, Count Kessler. One moment, Herr Erzberger I have to pass this on. The Allies demand, as conditions for a further extension of the armistice. Poznan, a large part of Central Silesia, and all of Upper Silesia are cleared of German forces. German territory to be handed over to Poland. Gentlemen, the Entente's demands in their current form are unacceptable. They are put forward with the obvious intention of humiliating us. Furthermore an acceptance would offer the French High Command the means to encroach on us for any transgressions at any time. I therefore propose the conditions are rejected. I am aware of the consequences. but the Allied action, which President Wilson endorsed, leaves us no other choice. This forces us to draw the final conclusions. Invasion. Herr Erzberger, are you still there? - The connection is so bad. Count Brockdorf-Rantzau calls for rejection. Well then he should, and he can come right here to Trier and continue the negotiations. If we don't sign now... You've said it often enough. Who is for signing? Sign. Berliner Allgemeine Zeitung Armistice extended. And so for troops it depends 100% on Luettwitz. Ends up at most with 50, from 200 volunteers, across the board. Clarification on an assassination attempt. That survived. Regrettable, we already know. I was just saying, how the general strike, thanks to the policy of Rheinhard and Luettwitz, can really look forward to, truely first-class man power, ha ha. Berlin, Suburban Train station. 26 February 1919 Excellency. - Captain Pabst. I am pleased to welcome on German soil the greatest military commander of the World War. We just want to hope that others are less happy. Scheidemann called you a gambler yesterday. I never surrendered. All lies. - May I introduce, Captain Pflugk-Hartung. - General Ludendorf. He and the men of our Staff Squadron are at your disposal as bodyguards. Thank you, the greatest stupidity of the revolutionary was letting us live. If I return to power there will be no quarter. With a clear conscience, I would watch Ebert, Scheidemann and comrades swing. I agree with you wholeheartedly Excellency. But first we have to ally with these Sozis. Until the Spartakists are finally defeated. Well you've already done some solid groundwork. Where I am staying? - Hotel Adlon. But that's also where the Allies' Commission is now. You won't be expected in the eye of the storm. We have also got you a new passport. You are now called Newman. Charles Newman. - Me and a Brit, originally. Comrades! Brothers! The general strike is declared. Spread to all workers! Even the SPD voted in favour! Come on! Support Germany! Berlin. 5 March 1919 Why don't you pursue my ideas, Count? Because it's only dreaming, Cassirer. Our task is to revolutionise the bourgeoisie. For the proletariat, that's quite sufficient. You are one of us, not them. It's getting so you can't even eat in here any more. But the Riesling is quite excellent. Given the stagnant situation it is probably best to get drunk. There's plenty of it. Er, Gustav! You don't see the situation correctly. The League of Nations President Wilson dreams of, is bound to fail. A league of states, a league of interests, a league of organisations, needs to be shut down. But not one based on real socialism. A socialism of the big stakeholder, in which big land holders, big business and big banks come together. When I tell my comrades that... Great idea of the Red Count. An owner's socialism they will carry on their shoulders. But basically you are a Bolshevik in disguise. So what's stopping us, from starting a party together. A woman could be won over to such nonsense at once. Where's the dear lady of yours? The dear lady is cheating on us in Munich with the fantastic Reds. To love. - Is that not General Ludendorf? Indeed. I thought he moved to Sweden. - And who are the others? Captain Pabst and Colonel Reinhard, Freikorps leaders. General Luetwittz, has commands in the Freikorps and Army. Hugenberg, Director General UFA. Helfferich, Director of Deutsch Bank and Cross Newspaper publisher. And von Berger, head of the Prussian Secret Police. Creme de la Creme of the reaction, dear Max. Have they an axe to grind with the world? A right-wing thought we should oppose between us, Cassirer, It is indeed you, gentlemen. I was not mistaken. Ah Ritter von Berger! Don't tell me, you want Duden arrested as a war criminal. Worthies, I'm not generally responsible for, Herr Cassirer. But you run the risk of being arrested because you as upper class consider a middle class revolution to a proletarian one. For this reason. Unbelievable. Noske, the Revolution Minister, but still popular with the people. Does not realise that militarism will also sweep him away. Nor that forces are at work here to preserve all that is bad and old. And a barbaric class is back on its feet to help. New Prussian Newspaper Head Office - Editor First Floor (Cross Newspaper) Mob of Spartakists rule Berlin. In Lichtenberg the police chief and 149 other police officers were brutally murdered. - How is it you always know everything? I've wangled the top organisations. - Admirable. Where were we? - 149 police officers. If the Vorworts publishes 60, otherwise at least twice as many for us. How many were there really? - One, so. 149 police officers brutally murdered. For how long does this democratic government just look on? Berlin, Reich Ministry of Defence. 9 March 1919 Halt! Anyone Continuing Will Be Shot! Any person opposing government forces found to be armed will be shot immediately. But, that means killing those captured. Necessity knows no law, Defence Minister. Wake up, Son. They want to pay you off. Here. The Official Settlement Office calls for the Marine Division to collect their outstanding pay. Such a thing. - 32 Franzoesische Street. The best day for a long time, Comrade. What are you doing? Government soldier like you. You rabble are mutineers not soldiers. I have government ID. Any person opposing government forces found to be armed will be shot immediately. Are you mad? Fire! "Die Freiheit", the voice of the Independents, deliberated on even harsher orders to shoot from Captain Pabst and his Garde Kavallerie Rifle Division. I quote. Whoever offers armed resistance or loots will immediately be put against the wall. Furthermore for houses from which troops were fired on all occupants regardless of whether or not, they plead innocence will be evicted, their houses searched for weapons in their absence. Suspects actually found with weapons will be shot. These orders, were actually issued, Comrade Noske? And further is it correct, as Die Freiheit further reports, that subsequently people were shot purely on suspicion? The cases have not yet been resolved. But the wrongdoers, however are on the other side. A too rigorous investigation of abuse by those who were most irritated by the rules of self defence followed by their own forces will be perceived by them as unjust. And may have bad consequences for the goodwill of the troops who frequently barely hang onto their lives bravely fighting in the streets. Nevertheless I'm having each case examined individually. That's already happening. - And how many of the other side are dead? - Twelve hundred. 1200 in one week! And for our forces? Seventy. I ask Comrade Noske that in the future orders the forces get on your authority are explained beforehand. Next item on the agenda. Noske, this petty bourgeois in his yellow shoes declared victory in a moustachioed snout speech over the proletarian enemy within. Disgusting! All decent and right thinking people must turn their backs on this government that plays so lightly and brazenly with its citizens lives. The last eight days have brought about, through there own fault, a rift with the German people, irreparable for decades. Here you are, Count. They arrested Herzfelde. - And rightly so. I strongly advised him against it but he absolutely had to publish the proclamation of the Bavarian soldiers council against the terror of the White Guards. He's an idiot. - The idiot now awaits your help. I know. But for your brother there is to be no more Spartakist magazine fun with my money. Knock on door Here, Frau Woellke. Reich Marine Military Service Book Military Service Book Woellke, Benno Woellke Family Get in there! Gun shots I've wondered about us for years now Count. You don't like me, nor do I particularly expect you to. And yet it is always a pleasure to be of assistance. Your cured pork Ritter von Berger. Staff literally make you sick. Whatever you say. What are you upset for, rascal? What am I upset for! For the many hundreds arrested! For the heavy handed way checks are carried out! Hundreds of thousands of them, by your staff! My God!! Murder!! Gustav, please! He was my only son! My only one! Survived the war unharmed for your miserable persecution! Already over now. Yes. Over. That should be enough. Argh. Berlin, Moabit. In front of prison. After days behind these walls it will be impossible for me to strike a light tone in my paper again. Your paper will no longer be published, Wieland. If I describe to you how the squadron of right wing soldiers inside, torture, murder and abuse... They are beasts. Completely dehumanised. You'll never again talk about the power of humour and will finance ten more papers for me. Gentlemen, the report submitted by the Government Commission, demonstrates that the German Reich in August 1914 contributed significantly to the outbreak of war. The Kaiser and the then Reich Chancellor positively pushed Austria to war. We must strongly condemn, these sins of the old government. Must set down the new government's position in a memorandum. Set up a state court to establish the guilt of the relevant person for the war. So I'm looking for a release. It can only help us in the negotiations. But the question of guilt must not be seen only from the narrow platform of the few weeks leading up to the war. The matter is complicated. I'm absolutely against a release. The documents give a one sided picture, unfavourable to Germany. They concern only the last part of the run up to war as my party colleague Erzberger pointed out. But England's encirclement policy and France's revenge policy must also be considered. But we could just reason that we didn't know these factors. For that reason we will not be responsible. And have completely eliminated the old regime. To confess guilt robs our people of the last of their self respect and leaves our opponents triumphant. That would be the second coshing after the population first had to digest that Germany lost the war despite our forces being far inside enemy territory. - As Prime Minister, I propose refraining from releasing the report. Who agrees? Well then, we have to. So following on, Assembly. Budget supplement sitting. Directly. The heating is not on for you either? Who did you talk to? Went unheeded. - I have complained but the porter claims he can't understand my French. That's meant to be coffee! - And that's the bread. Just no butter! We're not always much better off. You don't even believe that yourself. This palisade fences our entire hotel. They may as well have taken us to the Bastille. Bastille, Honourable Member? - That's what I said. Just march in. I have read both the draught and also the other speech Minister and I must urge you, not to stick with these speeches. They would not only provoke our opponents but also make any negotiations impossible. And that's exactly what I want to achieve. My name is not Erzberger as in your Zentrums colleague but Brokdorf-Ranzau, and I don't intend being the accused for Clemenceau and his gang. It's open. You won't believe it, Count. - What? Clemenceau wants to see us. - Ha ha ha. After we've wasted 11 days. L'heure venu du lourd reglement de compte. The hour of reckoning has come. The hour of weighty reckoning has come. Vous avez demande la paix. nous sommes a votre disposition pour vous l'accorder. You have requested peace. We are inclined to grant that. You have sued for peace. We are inclined to accept. Gentlemen, we are deeply inspired by the sublime task that has brought us together with you. To give peace to the world for all time. Plus forte, parler plus fort. Je comprends rien. President Clemenceau wants you to speak louder. We know the power of German arms is broken. And know the impact of the hatred which you propose for us. Je t'ai demand? de parler plus fort. Louder please. It is demanded that we admit being the only guilty party in this war. Such a confession from my own mouth would be a lie. Vous exigez que nous acceptons l'enti?re responsabilit? de cette guerre. Un tel aveu ce la mensonge. We are required to acknowledge our sole responsibility for this war. Such an acknowledgement on my lips would be a lie. I should have said, placing us in front of everyone was not right. But at least they could put on a display. The whole world watching us. Brutish, and here Article 87, Germany recognises the independence of Poland. Article 100, Germany renounces Silesia, West Prussia and Poznan. The Army will be reduced to 100,000 men. Conscription will be abolished. Germany renounces it's colonies. Germany liable for all loss and damage. Until implementation, the territory west of the Rhine to remain occupied. Every single article a humiliation. And you think I shouldn't have kept my speech! It's wrong, that's it! Good evening, Gentlemen. Gentlemen I'm drunk. That may be proletarian but I didn't know what else to do following the shambles in front of me this afternoon when sitting across the table from Wilson, Lloyd George with them Clemenceau. I saw how they stick blindly to the big adjustments. I'm telling you, if this shambles believe that the German workforce will slave away for decades for this capitalist gang... I'm ranting. Wild geese are rushing through the night With shrilling cry northbound - Unsteady way! Attention, be wary! The world is full of murder. No news from Versailles. And the French in Versailles are straight. Germany can still achieve a lot. The World Prize for Max Planck. In my opinion. Albert Einstein has it almost for certain. A German has given scientific socialism to the workers of all countries. We are once more on the path of the world. Socialist progress. Socialist. Can't do it without it either. To unite the whole German nation as part of of one Reich. We have to accept it otherwise it's collapse. Fritz. Congratulations on the silver wedding anniversary. Thank you Gustav-Adolf. Don't bring out any of Lapland's Freikorps incidents, under any circumstances. Freikorps? The Entente with 200 million needing food... Nobody's ready to ask anything difficult about these men. Hup, still no telegram from Brockdorf-Rantzau. In bed. - Urgh Then I'll now close the sitting. Urghgh! - Ha ha ha ha. Weimar, Bauer's Office. 8 May 1919 Minister. Minister. A message from Paris. Herr Erzberger. Herr Erzberger. Yes. A telegram from Brockdorf-Rantzau. The Entente's peace conditions exceed our worst fears. The German National Assembly meets today to adopt a position, at a crossroads for the existence of our people, to what our opponents call peace negotiations. Everything has been released except for Alsace Lorraine. Their right to be represented here has already been removed. And when I see, while toe to toe in their ranks, the representatives of all ethic Germans especially those selected from the Rheinland from the Saar, from East and West Prussia Poznan, Silesia and from Danzig and from Memel. They, when the will of our opponents is enforced, shall in the following days, be Germans under Germany for the last time. Then I say to whoever tries to separate us, who cuts with a murderous knife into the living body of the German people, 60 million behind barbed wire and bare bars, our opponents have not forgotten anything but learned everything about the meaning of annihilation and destruction. Which hand would not wither that puts itself and us in chains. This treaty is in the opinion of the Reich Government, unacceptable. I urged you not to use the word unacceptable. The words unbearable and impracticable would have sufficed. Now we're totally committed. This is a murder and thus unacceptable. Quite right! Gentlemen, there can hardly be a sadder occasion for a patriot to celebrate his 50th birthday than this. We all came to Versailles in the hope that a peace offer based on agreement would be made to us. We hoped for a just treaty. Instead we face with dismay the demands of a victorious opponent. These demands are beyond the strength of the German people. Therefore I would like to drink to the strength of our people. And to honour and a long life. Und wer im Mai geboren ist steh auf, steh auf, steh auf. Er nimm sein Glas vom Tisch auf und trink es froehlich aus darauf und trink es froehlich aus und trink es froehlich aus. Thank you, Gentlemen. We are well aware of that Minister. I want to speak to the President. Herr Ebert is listening. And the cabinet hears what I'm saying. Reich President, I submitted our proposals to the other side. Reconstruction of northern France and Belgium. Reduction of the army to 100 thousand men. Payment of 100 billion Reichmarks in gold. But that's it. It's anticipated that these proposals will be rejected. And then we have to sign. For only then, will the state of war cease and the blockade be lifted. You have simply no sense of honour. That's neither here nor there if people have food again, industry and resulting exports. Moreover Bolshevism loses its appeal. Admittedly however, a right wing coup against the government can not be ruled out. Ha, and you will be responsible for that. You negotiated this bollocks! And this International Convention given dictatorial powers over our national life. Whose authority will go far beyond that held by the Kaiser and Reichstag combined. You negotiated that! We are now awaiting the response from the Allies. I appeal to you again. If the treaty is not ratified we have war again. The Allies will advance on a broad front. North and south Germany will become separated. The blockade will be tightened. Martial law will be imposed. There will be famine, looting murder and manslaughter. Germany will be atomised. I substantially agree with Erzberger especially since the attitude of our troops is becoming increasingly precarious. Even a war torn Germany will come together again. This treaty, is for me a piece of paper that I will not sign. I have declared this publicly and I will stick to it. The acknowledgement of sole war guilt and extradition of the Kaiser and those military responsible. Germany can never sign. But a failure to sign does not avert the evil. Instead it will only bring mayhem. - Signing will also bring mayhem. It's unacceptable is the main point. but we have to agree. If you're compelled by force to sign, in order to avoid being unfaithful, you only need to say you gave way to force. The Germans were the first to use, what's now called, poison gas. You used aircraft for what's now called bombing and shelled towns without military justification. You are the ones who started the U-boat war. It is you who allowed barbaric treatment to be meted out to the prisoners of war you had taken at which peoples of the lowest cultures, would have recoiled. Germany's conduct is almost unprecedented in human history. The terrible responsibility that weighs on you is reflected in the fact that at least 7 million dead lie buried in Europe. While more than 20 million living bear witness through their wounds and suffering that Germany wanted to satisfy it's passion for tyranny, by war. The Allies therefore demand the German delegation sign the treaty in its present form without any comprise in seven days. If not signed the armistice will be deemed to have ended at midnight on 23 June 1919. Signed, Chairman of the International Peace Conference Georges Clemenceau. Dear friends and comrades, I begin with welcoming the delegation from Versailles. And warmly welcome them home. Weimar, Schloss, Meeting Room. 18 June 1919 Thank you for trying to do your best for our Fatherland and national community. If friends back home would've stayed tight we could probably have played a negative result by ear. However, the moment it became known through a leak, that the cabinet is split. The game was lost. Indeed, lost. In the French press, even the names of the ministers in favour of signing are being circulated. It's now up to the government to come to terms with this. For myself I'm ready to draw the final conclusions to this situation. And what do you mean by that, Reich President? Will you sign? Pull out? Fight? It's not clear, Fritz. It seems Erzberger has turned you around. I would ask to stop being stuck with the same, to vote. Who is in favour of accepting the conditions? Who is against? And you Count? As Reich President I declare, the Cabinet is not to make a decision. Gentlemen, you know I'm against signing. However we have assembled here to determine the military situation. We have exactly four days to go. Thank you War Minister. The discipline of the troops in the east is good. The population however fears Polish repression. General Luettwitz, I have to interrupt. On that point the Allies have backed down. Upper Silesia is not be given up unconditionally. Instead there will be a referendum, and we win it. My question is however can my government rely on the troops if it accepts the treaty. - The troops will not carry out an order to evacuate the entrusted territories. In this case there will be a fight with the French. I did warn you, before this war council. The Kaiser would never have negotiated with his generals, but you... The National Assembly will probably vote in favour of signing. The majority of Zentrums are in favour. Us Sozial Demokrats too. In Cabinet it's half half. It's likely to resign. I ask again, can I rely on you? Population and Troops are of the opinion that now they have to fight. The Entente is in the meantime ten fold superior to us. Military resistance is not possible before the Elbe. For this we must mobilise one million soldiers in the shortest possible time. That's exactly my intention. We pull ourselves back behind the Elbe leaving West and South Germany to their fate and I say this as a Swabian. Then we attack Poland. Raze it to the ground. And set up an eastern state. That is desperate politics War Minister. So far only General Groener seems to be on my side. I repeat once again. The National Assembly will under protest, vote in favour of signing and the Cabinet resign. I will then probably be appointed Prime Minister and Defence Minister at the same time. Can I count on you then, to stand behind me? That fundamentally changes the situation. All the troops would acknowledge a Noske administration with pleasure. The name Noske has for us all, a good ring to it. Would you accept? We would accept, aside from the shameful paragraphs. An acknowledgement of sole guilt for the war. And extradition of the Kaiser, and of the Field Marshal and even Ludendorf is out of the question for me. Both myself and my government agree with you on these points. A Noske dictatorship would be the best solution. Germany's salvation is now in your hands Defence Minister. Unfortunately I have to leave, Gentlemen. I'm urgently awaited in the Parliamentary Group. Weimar, Marstal, Meeting Room. 19 June 1919 If they accept the shameful paragraphs... Those with dirt on them must be disappeared. Then we will turn against the government. Gentlemen, we should discuss that in a small circle. It would certainly be spirited if 15 men put themselves at the forefront and reject the peace treaty. But they can do nothing when there are 60 million people close behind. The people are starving, ragged and without morale. Incapable of serious resistance. We must, under protest, sign. I also propose signing it with the following reservations. No acknowledgement of sole guilt. No extradition. Safeguarding from colonial failings. Revision after two years by the League of Nations. This debate is futile, pointless useless, Gentlemen. And I can't do anything now. Reich President, I hereby declare my resignation. In front of the National Assembly and the entire German nation I declared, the hand that signs this treaty must wither. I still stand by that. I have to join the Foreign Minister. I don't have any alternative. - Entirely my opinion. I'm also inclined to resign. Have you thought this through Herr Scheidemann? I hereby announce the Cabinet's dismissal. I declare agreement with the Cabinet's dismissal. The situation will thereby be clarified significantly, but I will not be resigning myself. I invite to my study those ministers ready to resign. And would like to emphasise if by 11 o'clock in the morning no new Cabinet is formed. I'm resigning too. - No Fritz! That says yes to governance by the Independents. It won't come to that. Scheidemann carried out his threat and resigned. Regrettable, and Landsberg as well, I hear. Gustav, I'm so sorry I can't appoint you Prime Minister as well. But Fritz... We have to finally crackdown. We still have disorder. Only a dictatorship can save us. I promised the troops. Then the party definitely falls apart, even more. You know how provocative your name is to the workforce. I'm not afraid of them. - You must expect riots. General strike, mayhem, Bolshevism. We can't afford that again. You're therefore getting rid of me. No. You have your post as Defence Minister and you can amuse yourself with even more difficult situations. I hope I can get the troops on side. And who then becomes Chancellor? Gentlemen of the Press, this is not the time to dwell on the past. Scheidemann's resignation I can only deeply regret. Count Brockdorf-Rantzau's reasons for abandoning the Fatherland at a difficult time remains a mystery to us all. For us, for you it's now up to the newly appointed Cabinet to lead Germany from the depths of despair to a brighter future. A Cabinet that with the refusal of the Independents and the Demokrats to assume government responsibility, I won't even mention the Kommunists in this respect, consists entirely of men from the Zentrums and the SPD. I now ask Prime Minister Gustav Bauer to name those Ministers appointed by him. Thank you Reich President. As my deputy and Minister of Finance I appoint Matthias Erzberger of Zentrum. For Foreign Affairs Hermann Mueller, SPD. For Home Affairs Eduard David also SPD. For Defence Gustav Noske, SPD. And for Post Johann Giesberts, Zentrum. And Dr Johannes Bell Transport and Colonies, Zentrum. Excuse me Prime Minister, but my office has just received a wireless message about orders given by Rear Admiral von Reuter to scuttle the German fleet at Scapa Flow. Did you know about this? - No, no idea. I feel Foreign Affairs doesn't now want to stand. Neither do I. Mopschen there's work. Germany has new heroes. In my office, make haste. Under his command, the newest and most powerful ships of the German High Seas Fleet, interned since November 1918 in Scotland's northern harbour Scapa Flow... - Can you spell, boss? Siegfried-Caesar-Adolf-Paula-Adolf. New word Fritz-Ludwig-Otto-Wilhelm, were sunk. Through this, many were killed or wounded. 1860 brave German men, officers and ratings, were dragged off to British prison camps. These men are heroes. Extra on the German fleet. Cross Newspaper extra. The end of Scapa Flow. Cross Newspaper extra. Not for me. Good lunch. Don't be cross with your friend. It's best I withdraw. But please enjoy the evening. It's like all life in my very soul, had died. I met Mueller this afternoon. He said if Erzberger was not eliminated he'd go down there himself and batter him to death with a cudgel. Mueller, the new one from the Foreign Office? No August Mueller from the Economic Council. I fear Erzberger will share Liebknecht's fate, but... Yes. I would like to be alone with Max and my thoughts right now, Grosz And I really don't want to interrupt, its just that you wanted to pay for the paper today and I'm really skint again Harry. Forgive me my friend, I forgot that. I hereby propose that the National Assembly vote for the Treaty of Versailles. Treason! That is treason! But subject to the reservations that Germany does not acknowledge itself to be the sole originator of the war. And that we will not extradite so called war criminals either. That's the majority. So the government proposition is accepted. Matthias! Matthias! A catastrophe. - What? The Allies don't accept our reservations. They demand a signing within 24 hours, or else it's war. If we now accept the shameful paragraphs, there is a coup. The troops then drive us out. Until now I persevered. My instrument that was created to maintain law and order, the Army, is broken. With that, my mission is over. I'll resign. Let the French come. Ebert here. General Groener, please. Good to hear your voice, General. Reich President - We are required to sign unconditionally. What position will the troops take on this? A fight is hopeless in our situation. If Herr Noske takes charge of our people and makes your appeal to the Army, every soldier is bound to stay at his post. Get Gustav back. What about General Luettwitz? He will have to join us, for better or worse. Gustav, our people need you. Come on. Defence Minister Noske has promised to stay in post, so what should I do General? Not as Quartermaster General but as a German I give the advice. Sign. Stay out of it, as usual Field Marshal. The proposal I have to put to you on behalf of my Cabinet means signing unconditionally. Shameless gang of November criminals. We are only four hours from the resumption of hostilities. A war we can not justify. Even if we could. We are defenceless. Defenceless but not honour less. Versailles, Palace, Hall of Mirrors, 28 June 1919 Signing of the Peace Treaty Silence s'il vous plait. - Quiet please. Faites entrer les Allemands. Il s'assoit. - Sit down. I think it's time that we take Germany's destiny in hand. Gentlemen. - I think it too. And troops are available. - If I had conducted the negotiations, then the Fatherland today would be presented differently. But now it is, what it is. And so we will fight. Dans ces circonstances j'ai pris messieurs les pl?nipotentiaires Allemands de bien vouloir signer le pr?sente accord. Stay seated. At this point President Clemenceau has the honour to ask the German plenipotentiaries to sign the present treaty. In these circumstances I request the German plenipotentiaries to affix their signatures to the present treaty. What is it now? Why are you waiting? Hermann Mueller Dr Bell. They believe they're destroying Germany. But it's Europe they will destroy. Berlin, Editor Cross Newspaper. 29 June 1919 Mr Helfferich, to what do I owe the honour? A disgrace, a disgrace this Versailles. And who do we have to thank, Grabowski? The Jews. - And who else? The Sozial Demokrats. - Also? I mean a very specific one. - Erzberger? I said that whenever I could, Excellency. Our newspaper is much too nice. That has to change. Too nice? - We do a whole series of articles. We attack these stinkers every day. Understood? Of course. - It must include crooked, criminal traitor, wrecker. - Understood. Mopschen, dictation! - And they start with Germany's humiliation, with Versailles. - Mopschen! That was ridiculous. - Yes boss. Write. Herr Erzberger, who led us in Versailles. Who indicated to the enemy his willingness to sign unconditionally the disgraceful... And slave treaty. - The disgraceful and slave treaty during the peace negotiations. - And now extradition. And thereby has the extradition of the Kaiser and other German men on his conscience. Who understanding what he'd done however knew how to dodge signing his treaty. Another thing must be that he's a Jew. But he's not a bit Jewish. He's Catholic. And? That is Herr Erzberger who has to be blamed for a dirty mixture of political activity and financial self interest. Who won't sue about these allegations despite being challenged in the strongest possible terms. Matthias you have to sue. You have to. Oh, then I'll be proved right. To what end? There's more. Accordingly there is but one way of saving the German people. Throughout the land with irresistible force, the call must go out begone Erzberger. Wir stehen uns stehen und muessen fallen und fallen wehrlos dir zur beute mond schwamm des urwalds frierst Du heute oh du spaeter dich und statt des gifts lernt ploezlich seinen Namen lallen er steht er steht wir muessen fallen. Your dramas get more dramatic, Becher. Lacking here the gut as always, Johannes. Me the head. - And me both. And me the format. Don't be cross with me. And I really need a drink now. I know how you feel, Becher. But it lacked only experience. You don't lecture the worker. I'm the shop steward of the Thuringia communists, dear Lady. For the worker, well the revolution is the only way to get cars and silk stockings. Don?t know any man works your way out there. And I'm talking to Madame Durieux, Herr Goetz. My father works at Borsig in Tegel and before the war I toiled away there too. The worker you describe in your play comes from a bourgeois morphine addict dreaming of her distant sweetheart. The upstart is taking liberties. You were asking for a fight so carry on. That's what underpins me. I can enjoy the perverse and bad. Committing theft to end up in prison. So I destroy my own life. Unfortunately I can't help you there, Frau Woellke. But my son still belonged to government forces and that's why I expect a survivor's pension. Government forces? Which government forces? Marine Division. No, no, no! But he still died for the Fatherland like his brother and his father. With your husband and the brother it's different. They died in war. And they receive those pensions. But the rich didn't. At the front or the rear. Now look here, your Benno was shot in a high treason clean up operation. That was an act of law enforcement brought in by Noske. You can't seriously think you will still get a pension for it. Next. I think they should. They have no honour, these criminals. I need you please to follow my advice and leave Berlin. They're still trying to get you Excellency before a war crimes court. Just let them come! - General I think you misjudge the situation. - But we have made arrangements. Excellency you will be well housed. Our Landkinder organisation will protect and hide all persecuted officers. That's a humiliation. - We have also established arms caches. Secret Citizens Defence volunteers are currently being organised. We will not be defenceless. - And also Freikorps? Noske has promised they can remain. - Noske also promised dictatorship and nothing happened. None of them can think strategically. Austria-Hungary is smashed. We can connect with the Bolsheviks in Russia. The Americans will soon leave. Leaving only England and France. And I can always deal with them. Minister? Herr Erzberger, still alive? Helfferich can hound me as much as he likes. And claim ten times the rich will be ruined by my new laws. War profiteers are those whose money on the... Something terrible has happened, Gentlemen! What's wrong, Johann? - You're alive! Thank heavens. - So what happened? They've blown up your office. You need protection, a bodyguard. They will try again. You got the last one. Bullets for me are already cast. And by those who really do want to. We take up the struggle. And I say it quite frankly. That it worked out this way is to a large extent also the fault of the Kaiser himself. Don't listen to Erzberger! Don't listen to Erzberger! Herr Hugenberg, please. Because of the war for four years Germany had, it can be said openly today, no government as such, but a military dictatorship. Several times there actually were opportunities for peace, but they were thwarted, with the active help of the conservatives. So in 1917 even the Pope asked it of us... Come, come! - A simple declaration on Belgium's independence would have been enough. But for four weeks there is no response. And what takes place in its stead? A fresh military effort. And the fool is well liked. Germany rushed towards death with open eyes. We've had enough of being called the authors of the end, by the right. Peace had to be made and the unity of the Reich had to be preserved. But you lost the war because you carelessly discarded a peace based on compromise when it was still possible. Only when it was too late Ludendorf told us that military resistance was completely shattered and that peace must be made immediately. You're to blame! You're to blame! Reconcile your side, damn it. Max von Baden's government made only one mistake. He shouldn't have sent me to Compiegne but Ludendorf. And should have told him you conclude the armistice. If he had, little would have happened, not the revolution. But he and you are to blame for the collapse. We've atoned for your guilt. You will never be rid of this guilt. Herr Erzberger. - Yes? Forgive me. Just for a moment. Well, I made a mistake. - Oh yes. I always thought you were a coward. I still consider your financial policy to be the wrong one but for that speech, you deserve my full respect. That is yes... That's more than an accolade to me, Count. Thank you. We must be clear on these tax reforms that we need to grow a new future. During the Monarchy possession and acquisition was about wealth for its own sake. In this future, the point must be made explicit that man is the be-all and end-all of all economic activity. In short, that private property has justification and limitations due to social interests. So the interests of the entire nation take on the interests of the individual. You've lost the Sozial Demokrats. We don't fully represent their interests. The Sozial Demokrats have plainly forgotten my task. Come tomorrow the army will be reduced to 100,000 men and the Navy to 15,000. Thus the Treaty of Versailles has been ratified by the German side, after one year and 50 days of hard struggle since the Compiegne armistice. Keep the change. Extra, the Kaiser's extradition from Holland turned down. Extra extra, extrad... Thank you. Extra extra, the Kaiser's extradition from Holland turned down. Berlin, Schelling Street, National Union. Director General Stinnes, he has significantly supported our Freikorps. How do you do. Director General Hugenberg, of the national press and UFA. That you founded two years ago, Excellency. I should have thought of it sooner. Propaganda is most important. It's a pleasure. Our Erzberger chomper, Mr Helfferich from the German National People's Party. I don't need to introduce him. Privy Councillor von Berger you already know. Excellency. - State Commissioner. Captain Canaris. Intelligence Service. Lieutenant Commander Erhardt. Erhardt Brigade leader. Gentlemen. Agricultural Director General Kapp Also supervisory board, Deutsch Bank is also well known. Good evening. - Good evening. And last but not least. General Baron von Luettwitz. Current senior General. - According to him, Excellency, According to him. - If you're alluding to me, Charles Newman, I'm just a civilian. Gentlemen, I would suggest we go next door. Basically time is nothing. Also events are nothing. Only the form and pace of the spiritual are something, and that is untouchable within humans forever. And the treaty? The war is over, Max. But for Europe a dreadful time begins. There is a sultriness before a thunderstorm comes up, which will probably end in an even more dreadful explosion, than the World War. Spartakism is defeated. Social democracy failed utterly at Versailles. It is now time to present them with the bill. That must be high, very high. Vermin don't only exist in social democracy. We will combat, these vermin. All of them. That was their last shameful treaty. The First World War lasted 1567 days, from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. A total of 25 states and their colonies were in a state of war. Three quarters of the World's population at that time was affected. 17 million people died, including 7 million civilians. 20 million were wounded. A million people starved to death. In France, entire districts and 480,000 houses were destroyed. The war never reached Germany. German soil remained untouched. The Treaty of Versailles sought reparations from the German Reich amounting to 132 billion Goldmarks, three times its gross domestic product before the war. Germany pays the last debt instalment - 56 million Euros - on 3 October 2010. Translation and subtitles KWC September 2020.
