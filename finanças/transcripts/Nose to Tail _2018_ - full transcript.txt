About time. Where the hell you been? Oh, come on, man. Give me a break. - I got here as soon as I could. - Well, not soon enough. We can't afford to fall behind today, yeah? A lot of shit to do. You know, Dan, if you're really in so much of a rush, then maybe you shouldn't wait until the very last minute to send me your list. Yeah? Well, maybe you should get to the market sooner. I was here till 3 o'clock last night. So fuckin' what? I never left. You got a problem? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, look at me. You got a problem with my process all of a sudden? No. I'm just saying it's not like I was out there jerking off or something. I've been sourcing ingredients for you all morning. That's your job. It's not like you're doing me some kind of favour. That's not what I mean. We're done talking about this. - Is that everything I asked for? - Yeah. Good. Start prepping! Yes, Chef. Next to you. What's next? That's enough. I need you guys to do these three bags. I need them done in like 15 minutes, okay? Okay. Ah, you're picking out some , eh? You wanna go grab some for these guys? Help 'em out? Teach 'em how to cut. So...? Taste it. It's not bad. Wait for it. See? That's how you know it's a little bit old. - Yeah. - Okay? - These are good. - Mm-hm. These are good. Smell that, that's good. There you go. Good job, good job. These are shit, though. They look shit. Alright. Alright. You're the chef. - Hey. - Uh-huh? - Here you are. - Mm-hm. Thought maybe you got hit by a bus or something, but I guess not. What are you talking about? You said you'd come by last night, - and then radio silence. - No, I remember that. I remember saying I'd try to come by, try. Emphasis on "try." Well, I waited up. Well, you shouldn't have. I was working. Hm, that's one way of putting it. Okay, Chloe, look. The best time for me to menu plan is after hours. It's the only time I get any peace and quiet around here. You still could call. You know, that's what people do. - Okay. - You know, right, right. I... sorry, I forgot who I was talking to. Well, you could at least make an effort to pick up the phone when I call you. Chloe, I am busy. Do you have anything urgent you want to discuss, preferably work-related? Or is this all gonna be about the airing of your trivial personal grievances? Oh, hey. Uh, Ray's upstairs pouring some of the new stuff from his book. I figured you'd want to taste with us. Yes, I would love that, Steven, thank you. See? I'm busy. I mean... it's pretty. It's pretty. But, like, it has no depth. It has... this is a table wine. Hi, this is Chloe from L'Asange, I'm calling... It's a nice a table wine. I'm not... you know. Alright. ...7:30 tonight. Okay. Okay, great, we'll see you then. Thank you. Oh... Right. I like this for the pork belly. You don't think something a bit more acidic would stand up to it better? Like, maybe... an off-dry Riesling. You know, something with a touch of sweetness. Oh, come on. No, no, no. I can't go back to white at that point in the sequence. It's gotta be the Pino. It's gotta... what, don't... you're just looking at me like... We can try it. - Come on, come on. - So sorry to interrupt. Can I talk to you for a sec? Well, one second... I'm, I'm... It will just take a minute. Alright. Uh, so I was going over the reservations for tonight, and there is a name with no contact info. I know I didn't book it. Evans, four people, at 8 pm. Yeah, that's... that's my friends. - Oh, okay. - That's me. Sorry, I didn't recognize the name. Do you have a contact number you want me to call to confirm? Nope. It's good. They're coming. - You sure about that? - Mm-hm. Okay, if you say so. I do. - We done? - Yeah. - I can go... back? - Yeah. Hello? Uh, yeah, hey, Ev, it's Dan. Yeah, I know. What's up? Uh, nothing. I just, um... I'm calling to make sure that we're still on for tonight. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Why wouldn't we be? Uh, I don't know. No reason. I'm just... I just was calling to make a... Uh... so it's gonna be four people, right? That's right. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. And 8 o'clock? We're still on, 8 o'clock? Yeah, see you later. Cool, cool. Uh, Dan, you got a visitor. What? Who? Sid. No... He's not here, is he? Yeah, he's waiting at the bar. Jesus Christ, I can't deal with his shit right now. You gotta run interference. Er, what does that mean? Like, go and be a buffer or something. Like, work your feminine charms. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that was part of my job description. That's, like, practically the essence of your job description. Ha-ha, screw you, Dan. I have a lot of responsibilities around here that don't involve batting my eyelashes at the landlord. Hey, hey, calm down! I'm joking. - I was joking. - You're not funny. I know. Look, just... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I take it back. You are indispensable to the smooth functioning of this establishment, okay? Yeah, okay. Okay, now you gotta go tell him that I'm not here. Uh, yeah, that's not gonna work either. Why not? 'Cause he knows you're here. How does he know I'm here? He knows you're here because you're always here, Dan. Alright, alright. I'm gonna... deal with it. There he is! Il padrone! How are ya? Danny. Yeah. It's good to... it's good to see you. Looking very well. Retirement's suiting you. Semi-retirement. Not out to pasture just yet. Right, I didn't... okay, so do you want a drink or something? I can fix you... - What do you want? - It's barely noon. Okay, so let's... Well, you wanna talk upstairs? Let's get outta here. Let's, um... Sure I can't get you anything, Sid? Espresso or a seltzer or something? Cut the shit. Uh... just trying to make you feel welcome. I'm just trying to be a mensch here. Well, it's my building. You don't need to make me feel welcome. And you wanna be a mensch? - Start by paying your rent. - Okay... I'm assuming that means that you didn't get the cheque I sent? - 'Cause... - Oh, no, no, no, no. - Yeah, I got it, alright. - Okay. It bounced. Just like the last one, and the one before that. I didn't know that. I said cut the shit already! I have been calling you for weeks, leaving you messages. You're dodging me and you know it. I am not dodging you, Sid! I'm just busy. Oh, I'm sorry you're busy. Uh, forget about it, then. Don't worry. Really? That's your excuse, huh? It's not... It's not an excuse. It's just... it's just the truth, Sid. Well, we're all busy these days, Danny. I'm supposed to be semi-retired. I'm up to my eyeballs in busy. I don't know what you want me to tell ya. I got a full plate I'm dealing with. So what? Does that mean that you don't have to pay your rent anymore? Or answer your phone? I should not have to come all the way down here to hound you like you're some sort of a deadbeat. I got better things to do, you know? I'll level with you. I... I got a bit of a cash flow situation right now. I'm just in a bit of a hole, but I'm digging myself out of it. I got a thing tonight that's gonna solve all my problems. Tonight. That's what they all say, Danny. You're nearly four months behind. I can't just keep letting that go on. You're talking like this is a chronic problem. This has never happened before. This is... You know it's never happened before. This is a blip. It's a... it's a... aberration. It's a temporary issue, that's it. I don't know what you want me to do for you. I just want you to cut me a break! You can do that for me, right, Sid? Sid, come on. Just like a reprieve, a little... a break. For old times' sake? I have given you plenty of breaks. If you don't want to give me a break, maybe... you'd give one for Jack? You see? There was a mensch. It's not the word I would use, but that's... I know you two had your differences, but he bankrolled this restaurant for you. He didn't bankroll, I... He left me the money. - I started the... - Okay, either way, he was always a good friend to me. Okay, so... Do we have an accommodation here? Sid... Sid... Alright, I will give you to the end of the month to get square, but after that, all bets are off. Fine, good, great. That's... thank you, thank you. Okay, no, listen, Danny. I'm willing to do you this favour today, but make no mistake, push comes to shove, I will not hesitate to sue you for defaulting on the lease. Never mind your father, I will get the bailiff to evict you, and I will sue you for everything that you owe me, plus interest. You understand? Your shirt's inside out. Everything okay? Huh? With what? With Sid. Oh, yeah, no, Sid. He's, uh... You know, he's Sid. He just likes to bust chops. Makes him feel alive. What the fuck is going on across the street? They got a line-up halfway down the block. Huh? It's just another food truck, right? Like, what am I missing? Oh, no, no, these guys are more like the hottest thing in town. DAN: - What? - Barf. It's true! They have this huge following. They post their location every day on social media, - and the fans coming running. - I know how it works. I just don't understand how it's still a trend, you know, how much longer people want to eat on the sidewalk. You might actually like their stuff. It's pretty playful and innovative. I do not need to try a new gimmicky take on fusion street food. They got pretty great reviews. Come on, Chloe, you know that critics are bullshit, right? They're all just lemmings out desperately looking for the next flavour of the month. - That's it. - Fine. But people seem to really like what these guys are doing. Plus, it doesn't hurt that they are young and hot. Well, you just proved my point now. Hm? That's... that's... now, that's really a case of style over substance, right? Flash and hyperbole over... over real achievement, real ambition. They're... they're... they're just... they're tweets, and they're faves, and they're likes, and that's it! They're just superficial fuckin' bullshit, Chloe! Okay... Hey, you asked me about the truck, and I told you. I'm on your side, remember? You tell Liam and Pedro they gotta move these tables for me? Yes. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's a beaut, huh? Best you got, right? Are you kidding me? I mean, it doesn't get better than a Mangalitsa. Just check out the belly. Look at the marbling. It's... it's, uh... Yeah, it's a little pricy, yeah? It's pricy. Will you knock it down for me a little bit? I don't know, man. You get what you pay for. That's premium-grade, top-of-the-line. Look, I got other heritage breeds if this is out of your league. I mean, the Berkshires are damn fine animals too. No, yeah, yeah. I want... I want the Mangalitsa. Alright, then. You gonna get it down for me, or...? You want a hand? I got it. - You sure? - Yeah. You mother... fucker... - Yeah? - Yeah. Hello? Hi, may I speak to Daniel Bitterman, - please? - Bieterman. I beg your pardon, Daniel Bieterman. Yeah, it's Daniel. Who is this? How'd you get this number? It's a private line. My name is Beth Childres. I work for Insatiable. I... don't know what that is. It's a website about food culture and the culinary arts. Ooh, food culture, huh? Not just plain old food, full-stop. Ooh-la-la. Call it what you will, I write a restaurant blog. Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't read blogs. Well, I'm working on a piece that I think you might be interested in. Why is that? Because it concerns your chef de cuisine, Keith Griffin. Or should I say your soon-to-be ex-chef de cuisine. What are you talking about? You really don't know, do you? Know what? When were you gonna fuckin' tell me? - Tell you what? - Don't play dumb with me. I just got off the phone with a writer from some website asking for my comment on your departure from my employ. Comment, mind you, not confirmation... she had that already. So, apparently, this is a done deal, and that's how I find out about it. From a fucking blogger! What do you want me to say? I wasn't looking to leave, okay? The Vortex people came to me and made a crazy offer. I would have been an idiot to turn that down. Then bring it to me and see if I can match it! Match it? Are you kidding me? No! No, you would have just gone ballistic, man. You don't know that's true. Oh, come on, Dan. This is... this is a big bump. I mean, real bennies, the whole package. There's no way you could afford to match that, man. What... what does that mean? You don't know what I can and can't afford! Whatever! It's not about the money anyways. Not really. They're making me executive chef. No one above me. I get to call the shots there. Wow. And... this is how you repay me? Repay you? For everything I taught you. Which, by the way, is every fucking thing you know, because you were a fucking dish-washer when you came here! And I busted my ass for you for years! I've had no life outside of this place for as long as I can remember, Dan. So I don't owe you shit! Are you fucking kidding me, man? You owe me everything! You wouldn't have gotten that offer if it wasn't for me. You wouldn't have even gotten close to it. You were nobody! You had no training, no experience. You were nothing. And I, I saw something in you. Mm-hm. I recognized your talent. I nurtured your abilities. I lowered the ladder down to you and pulled you up from the fucking muck. And I'm grateful to you, Dan, always will be. But I've climbed as high as I could here. I've hit my head on the ceiling. Can't you see that? Look, you said that you're not a real chef as long as you're grinding for somebody else, right? Right? You gotta have your own kitchen, be your own boss, cook your own food. That was your fucking mantra, Dan! I was talking about myself! Yeah. Yeah, of course you were. Mm-hm. Ah... You know, if this is how you feel, maybe you just get your shit and get out of here, you know? It doesn't have to be like this, you know? We can go our separate ways with mutual respect. No fireworks, no drama. - Mutual respect. - Yeah. Like normal colleagues. Friends, even. Who the fuck said we were friends? Fine. Have it your way. You always do. You fired Keith? Judas...? Was it Brutus? One of those dudes. That's a little much, don't you think? No, I don't think it's a little much, Chloe. He literally betrayed me. He stabbed me in the back. Or he... went behind my back, and... Whatever it was, my back was... Look, textbook betrayal! Maybe it all came out in an awkward way, but Keith is not a snake. He is not sneaky. It was just time for him to move on. Look, I get it. You like Keith. Everybody likes Keith; he's a great guy. But here's what you don't understand. This isn't just a personal affront to me, or some professional falling out where, like, the protege is splitting up with the mentor and striking out on his own, and blah-blah-blah. No. I invested in him. I invested time and energy and expertise... Resources! And now this Vortex group is gonna swoop in and reap the dividends. They get my methods, my recipes, my secrets. These are things I shared with Keith in good faith. You don't know that he's just gonna make some copy-cat menu for them. Chloe, why do you think they hired him? For his fucking vision? He had no track record outside of me! He's got... he's got no credentials! They want to steal my ideas, and then make some shitty, knock-off, assembly-line version of my cuisine. And Keith is gonna give it to 'em. He's gonna implement some soulless corporate hospitality group's ersatz "bistronomy" concept? Well, fuck him! And fuck that, and fuck him for believing in that bullshit! Okay. Okay, I see where you're coming from, Dan. But I'm sure Keith wasn't deliberately trying to harm you, let alone rip you off. He is just doing what is best for himself. You know, advancing his career. Come on, Chloe. Why are you defending him to me? I'm just... Of course it's understandable from his point of view! Yeah, nobody's a villain to themselves. Hitler had reasons. Like, he had a whole rationale for all that stuff. In his brain, it all worked out, and that he was doing the right thing, but you know what? He wasn't. He was the bad guy. Hitler? Okay, that analogy's not... the best, but like, you get what I'm saying. Sort of? Okay. This isn't about Keith at all. This is about me. It's all about me. I... I'm the one at fault here. Wow. Uh, well, that's certainly big of you to admit. Mm-hm. And a critical mistake. You should have treated Keith better and not taken him for granted? What? No. What? Opposite! If anything, I trusted him too much. That's the takeaway here. That's the lesson. It's a lesson that I gotta learn over and over and over again, for some fuckin' reason. You let people get too close, and they are gonna fuck you over. Sorry, Dan. To be honest, I was afraid this might happen. What? That you would react like this when you found out, - and.. - What are you saying? You're saying... What are you saying? You're saying you knew that Keith was gonna leave? Uh... I mean, uh... he didn't really confide in me... Look, I wasn't 100% sure, I... - Oh! - Yeah, okay, yes. I heard rumblings. You heard... Why wouldn't you tell me the rumblings?! Well, because I didn't think it was my place! And I didn't want to poison the well. I figured that Keith would talk to you directly if he was gonna make a move, and I didn't want to get in the middle of it. You are my eyes and ears out there, Chloe! I... That is definitely within your job description! Okay, it wouldn't have changed anything, would it? It absolutely would have changed things! How? I wouldn't have been blindsided, for one! I could have prepared for this eventuality, and planned an orderly transition, instead of being caught off guard short-handed tonight of all fuckin' nights! Now I gotta find a fuckin' replacement. Fucker, fucker, fucker... Fucker. Fucker. Fucker. God. Here... Not a complete asshole. Ah... Oh! Hey, did you find someone? Um... I tried, but no one's available at short notice, and I... can't be beating the bushes anymore. - So...? - So I'm gonna do it. - I'm gonna do Keith's job. - Plus your job? Yeah, plus my job. I mean, what choice do I have, Chloe? Someone's gotta pick up the slack around here. What about Angela? - The new girl? - She's not that new. She's been here almost six months. That's nothing. She is not ready yet. Is that because she's a woman? No, it is not because she's a woman. It has to do with experience. Do you know how long Keith was here before I promoted him? - Fine. - How long? Do it yourself... if you think that's the best use of your resources. Thank you! So, as you're aware, Keith is no longer employed here. Yes, Chef. I bet you knew for weeks that he was leaving. Apparently everybody here knew except for me. But, ah... never mind. Never mind. Uh, it's in the past. We are here to talk about the present, and perhaps the future. Keith is gone, and that leaves me with a bit of a problem, right? Yes, Chef. So, I understand you're classically trained. It says you went to CIA? Yes, Chef. That's a good school. Very... prestigious. But basically you have a formal education and a fancy degree, but very little in the way of practical experience. Would you say that that's true? - Yes, Chef. - Okay. Still, you've been here a while. Long enough to know the lay of the land, understand what Keith did for me day-in, day-out, the full extent of his duties. Yes, Chef. Good. And... what do you have to say? Do you think you can handle all that? - Yes, Chef. - Dah... Okay. You gotta cut that shit out. Cut what out, Chef? You know what you're doing. You can't just... automatically "Yes, Chef" me to death, like some fuckin' deferential fuckin' parrot. This is important. You have to think before you speak, and consider your answer. If you overstate your capacities or exaggerate your competence, I am gonna find out so fucking fast, and I'm gonna have to shit-can you too. So I'm gonna ask you again. Last time, okay? So, fuckin'... answer me honestly. Be straight. Is this a job you think you can do? - Yes, Chef. - Fuck! Okay... Mm... Now, ah... Yeah, alright. Fair enough. This is a mess. You need to clean this up right now. Hm... That done yet? No, um... Give me a sec, I... I got sidetracked there for a bit. So I take it things are working out okay with Angela. - So far, so good. - Told you she's good. That's not what I said. I said, "So far, so good," okay? Jury's still out. Let's see how she handles the rush. Okay. And you're welcome, by the way. I'm sorry. Are you suggesting I should be thanking you for some reason? Well, yeah, of course you should. I mean, I recommended her, didn't I? I hired her. No, I think Keith hired her, and you never would have even considered her to fill his shoes without my prompting. Oh, right, 'cause I'm a sexist boss again. - Is that it? - I didn't say that. Yeah, no, you just implied it, as per usual. Okay, well, you have to admit that sometimes you are a little slow to recognize a woman's abilities and contributions. And don't roll your eyes at me, 'cause it's totally true. Ah, what are you angling for, Chloe? Because I guarantee calling me a male chauvinist pig is not the best way to go about getting it. Now that you mention it, a little acknowledgement every once in a while would be kind of gratifying. Oh, you want credit? I can give you credit. I was in a bit of a pickle there, and you came up with an effective solution, however provisional. Bravo, well done. Way to think on your feet. Keep up the good work. Wow. You really know how to make a girl feel special, don't you? I just gave you your due, Chloe. What more do you want? Actually, I have a lot of great ideas that I think would be really beneficial around here, so you might just want to start listening to me more often. Okay, now you're pushing your luck. Can we just get through this evening without any more mishaps? Please. Are you fucking kidding me? No... No, no, no. Oh, oh, oh! What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? - I have my conference, remember? - What? We talked about it weeks ago. You agreed to look after him this afternoon. But that's today? Well, yes, that's today! Saturday. I'm presenting my paper! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! - Hey! - Hey, little man! - How you doing? - Hi, Dad. Good, how are you? Can you do me a favour? Can you just pop back inside the car for like one more minute? How come? Just, like, one more, because I just need to finish a conversation with Mommy, okay? Mais tu es incroyable, tu sais? Please, please, this is a very bad... it's not a good day. It's never a good day for you, Daniel. This is a really bad day. I am deep in the weeds today. In the weeds. That's what you always say! It's a big cliche! It's a cliche for a reason. It's a cliche 'cause it's true. Wait, that's a cliche too! Look, I'm saying this is a particularly bad day. Keith bailed on me. - Keith quit? - Yes. Mais vraiment? I mean, technically I fired him. But it was because he was gonna bail on me! I had no choice! He was gonna leave me for another restaurant! I obviously didn't want to fire him. Plus, Sid has got my balls in a vice, and he's cranking 'em. - He's cranking on my nuts! - Okay, okay! I get it, I don't need to hear more about your balls! Look, all I'm saying is these aren't garden-variety weeds. These are like big, bad, Day of the Triffids mother-fuckers. I know that's not... you don't know what that is, but like, they're... it's... I don't ask you for much. You promised me this time. I can't do it. I can't do it. Look at me. I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it. I'm so sorry. Please, please mercy, please. Mercy? Oh mon dieu. But this isn't a punishment. He's your son. You should want to spend time with him. I know. I wasn't going to get into this with you, but... What? I need to tell you something, but I don't want to do it with Jonah around. What are we doing? What, what, what? Okay, I don't want you to fly off the handle. You assume I'm gonna fly off the handle? You're marrying that Ted guy? He is a loser. Marianne, he's a loser. What? No. We broke up, actually. Oh. Sorry to hear that. Okay, tell me the shitty thing already. Look... This isn't easy for me to say, but... I am moving back home with Jonah. What, back to Paris? Yes, back to Paris! Of course! Why would you do that? You can't... Your whole life is here. His whole life is here. He's got friends in school. You know how disruptive it's gonna be for a kid like that? You're just gonna uproot him? Why would you do that? Because I need help, Daniel! I need more support. Okay. I know I haven't provided for... Come on, you can't be this hard up. I mean, there must be plenty left in that settlement. I'm not talking about the money. I need a support system. My parents are there, my whole family. Just, I need people that I can count on. Ray, what's the story, buddy? I thought you said we were gonna get these cases today. Like I told Steven, yeah, I can get them to you, but I'm gonna need COD. Oh, fuckin' COD. What happened to net 60? Come on, Daniel, your account's way overdue. I can't just invoice you anymore. How long we been in business together, man? - Nine. - Like nine years, right? And all of a sudden you don't trust me? Like, all of a sudden my word's no good? It's got nothing to do with that. It's not personal. Don't say it's business, man. Don't, don't. But it is. That's exactly what it is. That's... Aah! It's... you're lying. It's bullshit. It's personal because you're still pissed about how I wouldn't go in for that pay-for-play on the lane - with that plonk. - That's not true. You've always been free to order whatever you want from me - or not, no strings attached. - Mm, yeah. For me to order it... you're just not gonna fuckin' deliver it. I've let you coast on credit before, but I'm sorry, I talked to Chuck and we just can't do it anymore. This was a rush job. The driver's pulling OT. I've gone out of my way for you already. Yup, and I, uh... I appreciate you, buddy. I just... so here's what... here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna cut you a big, fat cheque on Monday. That's not good enough. I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna messenger it first thing in the morning. I just told you I can't do it. It's COD or no-go. Fuck, you are killing me, man. You know how badly I need this shit, and you've got me over a barrel. Is that it? What's it gonna be, Dan? Tick-tock. Did you just fuckin' tick-tock me? Ray, you mother-fucker, the deal is cancelled, and you can stick that precious Pino up your fuckin' weaselly ass! I know. I'm just not gonna be out-muscled by some fucking wine-peddling pussy! No offence. None taken. You know I don't think you're a pussy, man. No, I know, Dan. But we really needed those cases. I know, I know! Just... Look, look. It's back there, I know it is. Just dig deep. Dig deep back there. We have it. We just need it for tonight. Something, anything. Go back there, please, please. You got this? You got this? - Yes. - Great. Okay. Voila! This is the final draft? Yeah, you know I can't promise that. Yeah, fair enough. Um, so, FYI, these douchebags have been parked across the street all day. They just can't camp out like that. Um, like what? Well, they're just... they're just squatting. They're taking up multiple spots. That's not kosher. So, what do you want me to do about it? Maybe call the cops or something, I don't know. Sure, I'll call 911, 'cause this definitely qualifies as an emergency. Call the parking enforcement. There's gotta be like a snitch line for shit like this. It's not legal what they're doing! They're all the way on the other side of the street. It's really bothering you that much? Yes, it's really bothering me that much. Can you please take care of it? We've already found enough for tonight, Dan. This isn't really necessary. I'm telling you there's one back here somewhere. You know, I don't recall off-hand seeing an '05 Grand Cru just lying around before. Positive you didn't drink it already? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'd remember polishing that off. Wait, wait, wait a second... What do we have... here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it. Ah, there she is. I knew we had one. That's a rare item. How'd you get your hands on it? I got a case when I was in France on my honeymoon. A long time ago. You could probably get a small fortune for it now. Maybe. But we're gonna cop it. And you're gonna pour it with the pork belly for the VIP table. Are you sure? I mean, it seems like a shame to just give it away like that. I mean, the wine's still got great aging potential, and you could definitely keep it solid for a while longer. Maybe even till Jonah's old enough to appreciate it. No, I need it. I gotta dazzle some assholes. Okay, you're the boss. Alright, we're done! Actually, Dan, I've been meaning to talk to you. Why? What are you gonna say? I don't want to talk anymore about this Ray business, okay? There's nothing more to say about the guy. He's an ungrateful sack of shit. Yeah, but the thing is, it's not just him. I've been getting a lot of pushback from vendors lately. They're refusing to re-up until we get current. Look... I'm doing what I can. Sure, of course. But in the meantime, the list keeps shrinking. A lot of stuff is out of stock, and you know, it never looks good when people try to order something we don't even carry anymore. So revise the list! Revise the fucking list. Call it a conscious curatorial decision. "Tighter selection." "Short, but well-edited." "Menu-driven as always." Come on, man. - Daniel... - What? I hate to bring this up, but there's also a fair amount of inventory that's just... missing. You think one of your guys has sticky fingers? Honestly, no, I don't think that's it. Something you want to say to me, Steven? - No. - Good. - So we're done. - Yeah, we're done. Great! Except how do you want me to account for the discrepancies? Are you fucking kidding me, man? Breakage and spillage! What the fuck? These truck guys are still out here? Uh, yeah, I called the dispatch centre and reported them, but I mean, what more do you want me to do? Tell them myself? - The chutzpah on these guys. - Ah... Fucking generation. What happened to paying your dues, right? Kids these days. I... Are you joking? I'm not joking. This is not a joke. Okay. Sorry, you're absolutely right. Millennials really are the worst. When I was starting out, we apprenticed ourselves. Oh. Yeah, we fucking sacrificed, and we worked our way up, and we earned our stripes. We didn't just hang up a shingle and then start selling novelty snacks, and then get hailed the next big thing. Okay, I'm pretty sure those guys went to culinary school. That's not... culinary school is coddling. It's like... eeh... It's like fucking kindergarten. I'm talking about being on the front lines and feeling the heat, and being in the trenches with your back up against the wall. Okay. Okay, Dan, whatever you say. Uh, I'm gonna go get ready for service. You got this. I got it. You got this? I got this. You got this? I got it. You got this? I got it. You got this? I got it. You got this? I got it. You got this? I got it! You got this? I got it. I got this. I got it. You got it? I got it. You got this? I got it! You got this? I got it! You got this? I got it! I got it! I got it! I got this, I got this, I got this... You in there, Dan? What? Yeah, what is it? There's something I think you should take a look at. Just give me a minute. Alright, can I just come in? Yeah, just a sec. Just a sec. - Hey, what the fuck?! - What? - The door was unlocked! - I'm changing! Okay, it is nothing I haven't seen before. And besides, you're fully dressed. Look, I am in the middle of my pre-game routine. It is sacred to me. I need to be laser-focused and fully present. That means no distractions. Besides, you know how superstitious I am about my rituals! Okay, uh, well, I think you're gonna want to take a look - at this anyway. - I don't. Well, what is it? It's a story about Keith and Insatiable. If it's about Keith, what's it got to do with me? Well, maybe you should just read it for yourself. I am not fucking reading that. Summarize it for me. Well, uh, there were some relatively unflattering - statements made about you. - By Keith? No, not by Keith. Fuck, why are you telling me this shit right now, Chloe? I am telling you because the last time you thought I was holding out on you, you got so mad at me. Like, I didn't want you to feel blindsided if you stumbled across this or if somebody else brought it up. This is different. This is a fucking blog. Nobody gives a shit what this bitch has to say. Uh, actually, it was other chefs talking shit about you. Well, is that so surprising? I mean, I've stepped on a lot of toes over the years. Of course there's gonna be some hacks out there who want to bad-mouth me. I don't care what they have to say. I don't care. They can all go fuck themselves. Okay. Good. So you're saying this is not an issue? Yup. Not an issue. It's a non-issue. - Okay. - Great. Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute, um... What? Close the door for a sec? Yeah? So, I got a few minutes before I gotta address the troops, and I was thinking that we... Mm-hm? - ...could, um... What are the chances I could get, like, a blowjob? Are you fucking joking? I am... always serious about fellatio. That is a subject that is deadly serious for me. That was a joke. That was a joke! That was... look at me. I'm joking. Joking! But I am serious about the first part about the blow job part. - That... that was earnest. - Alright, Jesus, Dan. Calm... fuck, I'm... I'm tense! You know? I'm... I just need... And you brought that article in here! I don't need that shit right now. That's fucking my head up! I thought you said it was a non-issue. And now I'm rattled. Come on, I just... I... I need... I need a release, so... Un-fucking-believable. You know, you could have gotten some release last night, but you stood me up, remember? And I apologized for that. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, you didn't. In fact, you made an explicit point of not apologizing. And I'm making up for that right now. By sexually harassing me. It's not sexual harassment when you're in a relationship! Okay, first off, I don't think that's true. And... Ooh, secondly, it begs the question... Are we in a relationship, Dan? Hm? Is that what... this is? Because it doesn't really feel like a relationship to me. It feels like I'm your employee. Your employee that you order around and criticize and don't appreciate, and that you also happen to fuck from time to time, but only when it's convenient for you, of course. And so I'm thinking that if that is the case, if that is the state of affairs between us, then I should probably just quit, because I am sick and tired of being the whore on your payroll. No, Chloe, stop, stop! Look, please don't walk out on me! Why? Hm? Why not? Give me one good reason. Because I need you. Okay. So you... you need me, need me? Or you need me to work the front desk tonight? Can't it be both? I mean, is it mutually exclusive? - You are un-fucking... - Okay, wait! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - Okay! Just let me... I need to say one thing. Haven't you said enough? This is a different thing. Just... hear me out. Do I have a choice? I mean, yes, you have a choice. I'm not gonna force you to listen to me. Yet, you're literally blocking the door with your body. Hm? Dah! Yeah, okay. What? What? Say what you have to say. Okay. You know that reservation you were asking me about before? - Evans, party of four? - Yeah, the VIP table? Right, the VIP table. Well, that is not just some asshole I need to bend over backwards for. I've known that guy since forever, and he is seriously considering investing in the restaurant. What do you mean, investing? I mean, giving me money. Money I really, really need right now. Oh, for God's sake, Dan. What did you do? What did I do? What does that mean, "What did I do?" I didn't do anything! I'm just saying the restaurant is in the red, and it has been for a really long time. No, we've been consistently busy. I thought things were going well. Well, not well enough. What do you want me to say? It's a tough business even at the best of times. I'm just... I have been covering the losses for over a year, and I'm tapped out. I can't make up the shortfall anymore. I'm gonna have to close the doors unless I get an infusion of cash, and I'm talking about a significant infusion. Yeah. Now you know. Now you know why tonight is so important, and why I don't want you to leave. Why I'm begging you to stay. Please, Chlo... I need you. Now, I shouldn't have to remind you of this, but apparently you're slipping up again, so let me stress, for the umpteenth time, how important it is you do not elaborate on, or add to, any of these descriptions. They are minimal and oblique on purpose. They are meant to be suggestive and reflect an air of mystery, so please respect that and refrain from the urge to improvise or interpret, or otherwise comment on, what is written here. Is that clear? Now, if someone asks you directly for your... Here we go. Fire two soups! Yes, Chef! Fire four salads! Fire two soups, two salads! Yes, Chef. Fire four veg, fire two meat! Yes, Chef. - Fire two soups! - Yes, Chef. Fire two soups! Yes, Chef. Fire two sweet! Yes, Chef. - Hi, how you doing? - Hi. Uh, I got a reservation for four at 8 pm, Evans. Mark Evans. Ah, yeah, Mr. Evans, we have you in the private dining area. If you just follow me through here. - Oh, Mark, good to see you. - Yeah, you too, you too. - You remember my wife, Adley? - Of course. And this is one of my partners, Eugene Barnes. Great. Well, welcome. Thank you so much for coming. Glad you could all join us tonight. Normally I would let one of my staff give the opening spiel, but I wanted to come up myself, greet all of you, make sure you were comfortable and settled in before we kick this thing off. - Okay, I think we're good. - Yes? Okay. Alright, great. Well, let me get right to it. The menu tonight, it consist of seven courses, each accompanied by a wine pairing. I'm usually wary of extended storytelling metaphors, but if you are so inclined, you could imagine that each course is an episode or a chapter. The dishes have standalone integrity, of course, but there is a cohesiveness and a progression to the menu, the proverbial whole amounting to more than the sum of its parts. Okay, well... Now that we're started, we're settled in, we can get you going with an amuse, and that should whet your appetites and complement the fine growers' champagne that my sommelier Steven has kindly provided. And that's it. Bon appetit. Alright, cheers to that. I want to double-fire on table 12. You bring every dish to me personally. Yes, Chef. - Um... - What's wrong? I wouldn't say anything is necessarily wrong, per se... I know something's fucked up. What are you doing back here? There's just a little wrinkle you should - probably be aware of. - Hands. What? Beth Childres is sitting at one of the high-tops. Who is that? Beth Childres. You know, the blogger. Oh, for... How do you know it's her? Uh, it's her, alright. She's not one of these anonymous reviewers. She's more like the opposite of that. Everybody knows what she looks like, so... What does she want? Beats me, but apparently not just a drink. She ordered the full degustation. Hands! Table six. Thank you. Okay. Uh, fire two meat, fire four fish, fire two sweet! Yes, Chef! You got a lot of nerve showing up here after what you wrote about me. So you do read my blog after all? No, no, no. Not a chance. Someone gave me the gist, and you repeatedly mocked and insulted me. Well, that's not quite accurate. I merely quoted other professionals in the field expressing their individual opinions, which don't necessarily reflect my own point of view. That's barely a disclaimer. It was a hit job, you know it. You basically called... basically called me a has-been. But look around. Does this place seem moribund to you? No, it does not. We are full up, and I am operating at the height of my powers, right now. And I never said otherwise. I just pointed out that you are not part of the larger conversation anymore. People aren't talking about you. You've... you've lost your buzz. Buzz is bullshit. It's a made-up word that doesn't fucking exist. It was invented by publicists and marketing idiots and media people like you, who can all get in on the same circle jerk. Well, I'm not like that, I never have been, and I never will be. You're quite the contrarian, aren't you? A real old-school rebel playing by your own rules, proudly out-of-step with the times. You think... you think I'm posturing? You think this is just, like, I'm striking a pose to be controversial? Well, I'm not. It's just me. This is me. I'm not some cynical, opportunistic, pandering parasite, like... you. Okay. Daniel, I get it. And I certainly hope that's working out for you, because at the end of the day, we all know what happened to the dinosaurs, don't we? Wow. You have a great dinner, Miss Childres. Hands, please. Thank you. Oh, my god. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Wait a minute, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No! Black, black. Re-fire two meats! Yes, Chef. I'm doing that. I'm doing it. Out, out, out. Hands, please. Bearded guy gets this one, okay? Thank you. Thank you. It's my pleasure to tell you that the chef has a special surprise to accompany your next course. A wine pairing exclusively for your table. He's reached deep into his own personal cellar to find this rare 2005 Grand Cru from one of the finest domains in all of Burgundy. Thank you. How are we doing up there? Uh, I'd say they were... - suitably impressed. - Good. Fucking-well better be. That's a $2,000 bottle of wine. Oh, minimum. They, uh, wanted me to have the last glass. Mm-hm? How fuckin' magnanimous of them. It should really go to you. You should have it. You sure? I've had it before, so... Yeah, no, but I mean, it's not the same wine anymore, is it? It's matured into something more... more complex, more nuanced. Ah. It's all yours. - Oh, Jesus Christ, man! - Hey. You just scared the shit out of me. Ah, that's... I... I saw you come down here, so I just wanted to, like... Wanted to catch a peek, before I zip up? - You sure? - No, I just... I wanted to say, uh... Was it good? Everything was good? - Oh, it was fantastic. - Great! - Yeah. - Great. Yeah, Eugene's wife's been Instagramming every course. - Love to hear it. - Yeah. Great, so that's great. Everything's great? Yeah. I mean, we're... we're great? Like, you and I are great? Oh, yeah. Let's talk on Monday about that. Yeah, fuck Monday. 'Cause we're... I mean, we're here, right? So... You mean, you wanna do it right this minute? While my wife's waiting back at the table? - I get it. - Yeah. Obviously, I... I can't really wait till Monday, so you gotta tell me right now. Are we gonna do this? Yeah? Yes or no? Uh, it's not that simple. Mm. No? It's not fuckin' rocket science. Heh... Yeah. I mean, look, it's a great restaurant. Mm, great. Yeah. You said that. Back there, you said that once. And I mean it. I mean it. The food is top-notch, the experience, the whole speech off the top. You know, it feels very... I feel very loved, taken care of. If you love it, why does it feel like - you're backing out right now? - I'm not, I'm not. It's just, uh.... The numbers don't add up, is the problem. What? I know that's the fuckin' problem. That's why I'm talking to you! You're the numbers guy. You're gonna... I mean, right? But I cannot magically fix the math. Even if I knew the precise way that you could write this ship, you're not gonna listen to me! Come on, I would consider everything you have to say. Yeah, you'd consider it. And then you'd go back to doing things exactly the way you wanted to. That's exactly how you've always done things. That's what makes this restaurant so unique. So pure, if you will. But that also makes it virtually impossible to turn a profit. It's not about a profit. You're loaded, Ev. All your partners are loaded. That's not really... It could be a clubhouse for you. You come in, you could entertain. Clients or whatever. You could get anything you want. You got somebody you want to bring? Nobody, you know, little side piece or whatever. I don't know! Whatever you want. I'm just saying, this could be... this is the perfect fucking write-off for you. Yeah, except I'm not looking for a write-off. My partners and I are looking for a legitimate opportunity, with a reasonable expectation of a return. This place is not that. I don't understand. Did you know that you were gonna come here and say this to me? I mean, I jumped through every hoop. - I was your dancing bear. - No! I only came... you invited me! Don't I treat you well? I hadn't been here in a while... I just brought people whose opinions I respected, and they love the place. They're super-impressed! - Okay! - Yeah, but that just underscores the point that the quality is not the issue here. - It never has been. - That's what I'm saying! But the numbers that you sent me, I'm sorry, but dollars and cents wise, it makes no... Look, it's the bottom line, right? That's why they call it the bottom line. That's it. That's all that matters. - Please. - What? Please. I need you to do this thing. You said it yourself, the place is good. The place is good. It needs your help. And you can give it. I mean, this is nothing for you, and you can be a part of this thing that's good. Right? Okay, look, just stop, please, okay? You're disappointed, I get it. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter if I'm doing well or not, I'm not gonna throw my money away on a whim. Alright? I'm not gonna be your patron, if that's what you're hoping for. I'm not a Medici. Not for a guaranteed losing proposition. This place is not a sound investment. It's not financially viable anymore, if it ever was. I can't believe what you're doing. What? You're being a shitty friend. You're guilt-tripping me? Is that supposed to work? Okay, take all my money. No, I'm just telling you what you're doing. That's what... okay, okay. You fucking had a chance to save me, and you're gonna leave me... you're gonna walk away? - Yeah. - Shitty friend, Ev. - That's you. - Alright, you know what? Can you just knock it off with the calling me "Ev" shit, like we're deep fucking best friends from way back in the day? Alright, we were never that close. You realize that? When you called me and asked me for help, I was like, "Really?" Wait, wait, what are you talking about? Does that not ring a bell to you? Quite honestly, back in high school, you didn't really treat me very well. I was... I was not on your social level. That was 25 fuckin' years ago. And you haven't changed a bit. You're still so wrapped up in your own little world that you don't realize you're a pompous, egotistical prick who doesn't give a shit about anybody but himself. So, no, I will not be underwriting your petty fiefdom moving forward. If I were you, I would actually declare bankruptcy. You're not me. You should cut your losses before you get even worse in debt. And then maybe you take a good, long look in the mirror, and figure out how to stop being such a fucking asshole. You guys have espresso, right? We'll take four. What are you doing out here? We're in the middle of service. What the fuck does it matter? Hey, what is going on, Dan? What happened? What do you think happened, Chloe? He passed. Okay, I'm sorry. Oh, Jesus! Ow! God... Oh my God. Let me see, let me see. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. No, you're not fine. You're hurt. Just let me see your hand! Just let me see... Dan... I don't need your fuckin' help! What's up, Chef? Need a bite to eat? Heh... No, no. I need for you to get the hell outta here, that's what I need. - That's a good one. - Yeah. - You're joking, right? - No, no. You got your little block party. Good for you. Sure you took a nice Instagram of it or whatever, but it's time for you to pack up your shit and get out of here. Nah, nah. We still got all these peeps to serve. - Can't just leave 'em hanging. - Okay. I think the peeps have been served long enough, yeah? You've been parked out here all day. I get it, I do. I know what you're doing, but like, it's bullshit. - It's not cool. - Says who? I'm not breaking any laws. I got all the right permits and shit. I asked you nicely. That was nice, okay? And now I'm telling you, if you don't pack your shit up and get the fuck out of here... What? What are you gonna do about it? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Or maybe you just can't handle a little competition. You think you're... you're not my competition. You're not even a chef. You're a punk kid in a truck! Ah, it's gonna be like that, huh? Yeah, it's like that. Look, why don't you just go back where you came from, old man? What'd you call me? What, you going deaf now too? No, I fuckin' hear you! What are you waiting for? Get the fuck outta here! What the fuck? - You give me that! - You're not moving? - You don't get this. - What the fuck, man? - Why you trippin'?! - I don't know, bro! Why am I trippin'? Why am I trippin'?! Yeah, why am I trippin', hey? Why am I trippin'? Oh... Wow... The fuck are you looking at?! Get back to work! Dan? I just wanted you to know that the kitchen's closed. Pretty much cleaned up. Angela saw to it that all those dishes were remade to your specifications. She's good. It was a team effort. - Everybody stepped up. - Yeah. Yeah, it's a solid crew. Chloe handled the front house. It was, uh... chaotic there for a while, but she took care of it. That's just part of her job description. What? Nothing. She still here? Everyone's gone. Want a? Sure. I just wanted to make food for people. I don't know... I thought it'd be simple. Honest and, uh, primal, you know? I thought making something with your hands, from scratch, building a whole place from the ground up, you'd give everything you got to it. I just thought... You had nearly ten years here. That's a good run. Christ, it's practically an eternity in this business. Yeah. Hurray for me. It's late. You should go. You coming? Uh, no. I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna lock up. You sure you're okay by yourself? Mm, yeah. No, I close alone, man. I always close alone. No, I mean... Are you really okay, Dan? Fine. Hey, Steven. Yeah? I'm not sorry, you know? I stuck to my guns, no matter what. I mean, I accept responsibility for everything, yeah, but I'd do it all again, exactly the same.
