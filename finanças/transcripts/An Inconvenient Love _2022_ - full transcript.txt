Workers in plight! Fight for your rights! Workers in plight! Fight for your rights! Siena Corporation! Shut it down! Wilfredo Siena! Kick him out! What we ask for is additional pay, not additional pain! Hear, hear! What did you do to us? You attacked us! Threatened us! Injured us! Many of us are still in the hospital with no money to pay the bills. And then you fire us! Don't we have the right to be treated fairly? Right! We're tired of being taken advantage of, of being discriminated against, and of being abused! Right! Your people are hungry! Pay us right! We will fight for it! FRIENDS, THE TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE! TRUE! WHERE ARE YOU, AYEF? ON MY WAY. I WON'T BE LATE TODAY. Have you ever experienced going to work feeling fresh, feeling great, and then boom! Reality hits you hard. - We got here first! - No, I did! - Line up! - Don't touch me, miss! I was here first. Get in one by one. No pushing. Every waking day, you have no choice but to keep on fighting because you were not born rich. Head straight to the back. Miss, we're full. I'm small, I can fit. We're just fighting for what is rightfully ours. Really? Just post it on social media. We have a right to free speech! Let us be. You're being a nuisance. Sir, we have a permit. Check this out. I was going to offer my seat, but, he looks like he can punch harder than me. What a shame. I almost fell in love. Excuse me! Even if you fall for me, I would never date a loser like you. Tell him! Your jokes are as lame as you. - We were just kidding. - Don't you have respect for women? Yeah, treat her well. This is my everyday. It's so messy and chaotic. Stop this! What the hell? We're asking nicely! Ah! Let go of me! Catch him! If you had my life, would you survive? Actually, I survive every day because of K-Pop. And now, I also have P-Pop. I'm getting down here. I'm thankful for my biases. Jungkook used to be my only bias. But now I have Aki too. Bias means your favorite person. The one you worship. The one you love the most. But there's also a thing called a bias wrecker. Your bias wrecker will wreck you. He will rock your world and destroy you. The truth is, I don't have a bias wrecker. I haven't met him yet. Sorry, miss. My bias wrecker. What are you doing? Please just go with it. My life's at stake. - I'll scream. - Please. Stop right there! Don't panic. Stay cool. Hey, hey, hey! We got you, communists! You! We've been chasing you. Sir… That's a serious accusation. Firstly, "communists" and "activists" are not the same thing. Secondly, is it illegal to have a date with my girlfriend? Is it not allowed to go on dates now? Oh, come on! We already know that trick. You pretend that you're a couple when you're really part of the rally, right? Come with us. Enjoy your date at the police station! Hold on. How can you say that we're not a real couple? Do you want us to kiss in front of you? Yeah. Kiss? Yes! We'll kiss. Wait. No need to kiss. What's in your bag? Sir, it's bad to accuse without proof! Why do you need to check his bag? - Show us what's inside. - Huh? Sir, it's just some stuff. Work stuff. I need this for work. - Let me see. - No need to check. It's just for work. Why don't you show us then? - Let me see it! - Okay, sir. - S-Sir! - Let me just open it. Is this necessary? Isn't this a violation... Show us. Baby, hold my hand. What? Why do you need to hold hands? Sir, it's just that we need to hold hands because… …you'll have to chase us! Run! - Catch us if you can! - Ah! Whoo! Let's go! Quick! Move faster! - Let's go there! - Come on! - See them? - No, sir. - Why? - Don't look. Let's split up. They're gone. It's over. Ah! That was wild! That was a first for me. You're amazing! - I'll go now. Bye! - Wait. You're hurt! What's your name? Is that really what's on your mind, my name? Do you have a boyfriend? I'm married to Jungkook. I'm Jungkook's wife. Ouch! Any more questions? Good. I'm late for work. I'll go ahead. Oh, no! Miss, wait! You take care. I didn't mean to bother you. Sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs. Jungkook. Why are you giving me this? So I can see you again. Give it back, okay? Whoo! Yeah! Thank you, Mrs. Jungkook! Bye! Whoo! Hello! Good day, my friends! It's pouring outside. Traffic is bad! Philippines, are we late again? Kidding! I am your one and only Lady E. Lady Eme… ly! It's true what they say. Life is extra hard these days. Okay, okay. Hassle! Haggard! Oh my gosh! Do we have a choice? We chose this life! Kidding! I'll send it, Ma. Anyway, that's it for today. Time to chill. Don't take life too seriously because you can't get out of this alive. Good-bye! Oh, my. What time is it? Madam Ayef is late again. What's your excuse this time? Traffic? Flooding? Road works? Transportation crisis, madam. Whatever! Looks like we're ready for the day. Ladies and gentlemen, here at 24-Ever we are here to serve because that's what the customers… deserve! Time to work! Sis, is this finished? Not yet. Can you finish it? Just take them out. Your time is up. You're expired. Thank you, canned goods. You too. How about you? Thank you. Bye. You still have some time left. Enjoy the aircon. Take care. Sis, are you okay? Of course, I'm good. Counter two, long line! I got you, Joberto! Sis, did you see Kookie's arm? Yes, sis. Her ugly, gaslighting boyfriend hit her again. She should report him. I'll talk to her later. I hope she listens to you though. Your total bill is two hundred one pesos. - Cash or QR? - QR. Please scan. Go ahead! Ruin your lives with your so-called love. Ruin our lives? Love is part of the human experience. A cultural phenomenon that arises partly due to social pressures and expectations. Thank you! As if you don't get crazy when you fall in love. I mean, everybody gets crazy when they're madly in love. Right, ma'am? Correct! - Thank you! - Babe, let's go. Sis, please pray that I get accepted to the Singaporean company I applied to. So I can go there straight after graduation. Have I shown you my thesis? Here. Mmm… Nice! It's so nice! There's still a lot to be done but your solution is to leave? But… why are you working here if you have big dreams? Pop off, sis! It's not like that, madam. I work here because I get paid for my hard work. I get to save money. And it's near my house. Convenient! Whatever you say! Oh, ma'am! Look! It's a sign. October 4th is my graduation day. After I graduate, goodbye, 24-Ever, goodbye, Philippines, and hello, Singapore! Ninety-two pesos, ma'am. Do as you please! But know that escaping isn't a solution. Respect my opinion! I'm not escaping, madam. I just want to have control over my life. If I stay here, no matter how hard I work and whatever I do, nothing will ever happen. Respect the truth so I can respect your opinion, madam. My dear, life isn't like that. You can't control everything. Your payment, please. Done. Payment sent. Dobs, that's beautiful! What's your inspiration? The show that Manny and I love to watch. But he doesn't have time for me lately. Hey! I'm back from an adventure! Sir Manny! What's up? Bro! Hey, hey, hey! Manny, you didn't bring me with you. Dobs, it's better that you didn't come. There were a lot of enemies. Good thing I have a golden sword! Our favorite character doesn't use that anymore. He uses a night sword now. You don't know because you don't watch anymore. So… just because I used the wrong sword, you don't like me anymore? I got wounded in the fight. Really? Ouch! Dobs, son, please have dinner. You still haven't eaten? He still hasn't eaten? - Not yet. - Look at this. This is a new concept! You just thought of this now? Eat first and then you can continue that. Go on. Eat a lot! - Dobs. - Hey! I've been craving Japanese mayo lately. Hey! And greens! Do you think my baby will look like a Japanese cow? Wagyu? Ma'am, do you want me to make you a drink? Sure. Ah… Cucumber with celery and green pepper. Okay, ma'am. Viv… Mm? Who's the father? Do you plan on telling Daddy? I can't wait to give birth so I can finally move into my own apartment. Dad, it's just one dinner. I'm sure your secretary can find some time for us. If you want me to come to that dinner, you should help me. You know how busy I am. Dad, you know that my focus is growing my business, right? The plant shop? You're just wasting money. I don't think so, Dad. It has potential. I invested my savings there. Precisely. You saved that money. You should've been smart about it. I've been trying to convince you to train under me. Why don't you want to work for me? For our company? Dad, maybe you could train somebody else. Who? Dobs? You make me laugh, son. Oh, Manuel… - Dad, about Dobs… - Grow up! I was thinking if I… Enough about that kid. I will only come to that dinner if you work for me. I'll consider it as long as you go to our birthday dinner. There. That's it. That's how you do business. I'll think about it. I'll check my schedule, okay? I have to go. I still have a meeting. Bye. WILL OUR BABY LOOK LIKE ME? I HOPE SHE LOOKS LIKE ME! - HERE SHE COMES! - HERE SHE COMES! MY BABY! WOW! MY DAUGHTER! THAT'S IT? WHERE'S MINE? OH NO… SHE HAS NO HEART? THIS IS YOUR FAULT! WHY ME? This… this looks… How is it, ma'am? Does it look okay? It's still a little rough. I plan to edit the background. I just tried to... Hey, wait! Listen to me first. Relax! This looks okay! Okay? Just okay, ma'am? Dear, you know that I'm always rooting for you, right? But if our goal is to get that internship in Singapore, then I'm a little concerned. This is a draft that you've been working on for a month, right? - Oh my gosh! - Ma'am, sorry. It's just that… my workload in school is heavy, and I always work overtime at my part-time job. Okay, fine. Yes, I know. But remember what my colleague said. He can only reserve one more slot. Please, dear, don't make me lose my confidence in you. Yes, ma'am. Promise! I'll work on it! You can do it! I believe in you! SOCMED, DO YOUR THING! #FINDWOKECUTIE Another problem at work? Are you for real? So, this is on me again? How many times do I have to do this, Filemon? I just got home from work! I am so tired, Filemon! And this is what I come home to?! You got retrenched again? That job wasn't a good match for me... Who cares if the job is a good match for you? - This is for our family! - I can still look for a new job. Shouldn't you be the one providing for us? All you do is quit! I'm sorry! There are a lot of struggling families, Filemon! You annoy me! You're blooming, sis. Your suitor even sent you coffee! I know right. I hope you get sent coffee too! How about our other friend here? Since when did you bring an umbrella? I bet you also have a suitor. This isn't mine! This is from the guy I met yesterday. - A guy? - A guy? - You met? - You met? - Yesterday? - Yesterday? Is he handsome? Does he look like a celebrity? Who does he look like? Describe him to us! - Is he good-looking? - He looks like him. Who? HalaManny? Hello! Please visit our plant shop. No way! Sis, that's him! He's handsome! Why is he here? Please tell your boss Manny to visit us if he needs anything. We're just around the corner. Tell him that it only takes 24 steps to get to 24-Ever! Somebody's waiting for him there! - Thank you! - Visit us at 24-Ever! Do you have condoms? How many do you need? Just one. Give me one pack of cigarettes. - How old are you? - I'm a customer! Even neighborhood stores sell them to me! What is this, a hardware store? - We don't sell to minors! - Killjoys! - We won't let you buy them! - Goodness! Close this shop! Goodness! Look at her. - Definitely waiting for someone. - Confirmed. Do it! Gotcha! - You two! What are you doing? - See? We're making bets on what time he'll come. The handsome guy who sells plants. You know what? You're crazy! Stop acting as if you don't care! Her heart is obviously fluttering! What are you talking about? - That tarpaulin? - Yes! You've been watching too much K-Drama! So, sis, what will you do if he comes here and you see each other again? Then I'll do my job and serve him. Is that so? Is he not your type? He's okay… - He's handsome. - There we go! She admits it! I just said he's handsome! Hello, my dear listeners! Are you having a good morning? I bet you're waiting for something great. You're nervous that he'll suddenly appear, right? Here's our next song for those who are denying their true feelings… Look around. He might be around. Ayef… So "Ayef" is the real name of Mrs. Jungkook. Nice to meet you again, Ayef. Where are you going? Give that to me! No! - Go there! - Sir! Hi, sir! Hello! Welcome to 24-Ever sir, where customers are served what they deserve. Miss, how much are the… pies? 35 and 37, sir, it's written in there. What are the flavors? Ham and cheese. Tuna and cheese. You may read it there, sir. Are you required to be rude? To those who will make a scene. I'm not making a scene. But you look like you could. We can tell! Sir. Can you just tell me what you want? My lips are tired. Sorry. I'll get the ham and cheese pie. Ham and cheese. And another… tuna and cheese. Anything else, sir? That's all. Okay, that will be… Ah, miss! I'll just buy everything. Oh, my! What a happy day! We sold out so early! What a day! You have an amazing salesperson in… Ayef. See you, Ayef. Come again, sir! See you, sir! Your lips got tired, sis? And a one, and a two, and a… Ooh! Okay, Ben 1 and Ben 2. Yes! Taste this. It's so delicious. Thank you, boss. Is there free coffee too, boss? You want coffee, B2? Mm-hmm. No problem, just help me. Hmm. Let's test your stalking skills in three… two… - Boom! - That was fast! My, my, my. I know where this is going. Let's look at the IG bio. "It's not easy to be me." - So dramatic! - That's it! That's enough! Give it back! - Oops, liked his pic! - I saw that... Ah! Oh, no! We're not looking for trouble. Trouble found us! Bio… "Imperfect perfectionist. Future animator." Let me see! Oh! Oh, no! He's hiding something! Is he single? Well, well, well… Wait, maybe she's taken. Nope, no boyfriend. That's right. What if she has a girlfriend? Give me that! Boyfriend! - Boyfriend material! - Are you sure? It's giving fun! It's giving energy! It's giving... It's giving we're not meant to be. Oh! You're so judgmental! First of all, he's young! Ah! Yes! Second, he's just having fun! Yes! Lastly… - He is handsome! - Yes! - That. - Yes! Enough, we're not compatible. He has time on his hands. I don't. I don't even have a choice because I was not born rich with generational wealth! And I have plans. I know what I want, and nothing can stop me. No one. Ayef, I honestly think you like him. Don't deny it! Not the usual type. Interesting. I want to get to know her. I need to get to know her! Aggressive. Rawr! I like it! Oh, no! Oh my gosh! It's HalaManny! Stop it! You already have a kid. Whatever! Hi, sir. Hi! What time do you finish? - Huh? - What time do you get off work? Sorry, sir. We don't sell personal information here. Dinner? My treat. What time do you get off work? I'll only give you fifteen minutes. Just think of this as a free trial. You're pressuring me. I'm being paid per hour. I don't like to be deducted. I mean, I don't even love you. So, if you love the person, your time is not limited? It's expensive to love. I'm just a minimum-wager. You're good at drawing. I saw it on your IG. Are you an artist? Are you a stalker? You liked my picture first. Two burgers in here, please. I'm finishing school before I leave. I want to work as an animator abroad. Why don't you like it here? There's no future for artists here. And… pay is low. - And you don't get credited for your work. - Sir, here is your juice. The protesters are complaining about the malpractices committed by your company. How true is that? Those complaints have no basis. All they do is whine. You won't prosper if you are lazy. - I work but I don't prosper! - The problem with these protestors… - Right? - Right! No matter how hard you work, you'll get nowhere. …Is that they want to be regularized, yet their work is substandard. What a jerk! You can only speak like that because you are rich! What an arrogant man! - Right, miss? The nerve! - Mr. Siena, thank you. - Where's my juice? - Coming! Don't be so harsh on my father. Really? That's your father? You're joking. Stop messing around. Is that really your father? Sorry. I didn't know. That's okay! What am I? Sensitive? Wait… If he is your father, didn't we meet at the rally? So you're fighting against him? First of all, he doesn't know. Second, I'm just helping the people that I can help. I'm just doing and standing for what's right. If you're a rich kid, what are you doing in our store? And now you pretending to eat cheap food? Do rich people like you have a thing for us oppressed people? You're my type. As simple as that. You're judgmental. Huh? You're a player. You're so good at flirting. Bravo! You should smile more often. It suits you. Stop it! Stop with your pickup lines! Why? Do I look prettier when I smile? Yes. You look beautiful when you're happy. Time seems so fast! Okay, let me ask questions this time. Did you break up with Jungkook? No. We're married. There's no divorce in the Philippines, so we will be together forever. Does he know? I hope he knows. You know what? I'll be honest with you. You're cute. You're my type. But I'm not looking for someone. It's easy to meet somebody, but it's hard to be in a relationship. So, let's not waste each other's time because… this has no future. Wait, I was just asking if you have a boyfriend. Why does it feel like you want us to end up together? Are you expecting that? Whoa! Me? Me? Then why did you come to the store and buy all the pies? Also… you stalked my IG. Lastly, you asked me out on a date. Am I really the one with expectations? Fake news. I thought you didn't love me yet? Why are you calling this a date? And also… if you want to call this a date, I'm in. If you want to. Because I would love to. Hey, I still have two minutes. Two minutes to walk back to the store. Right? Your free trial is over. Okay? Okay. Bye! Thank you! Wait, I have something to say. Go ahead, say it while we're walking. I like you. Where are you going? I said I like you. I'm gonna leave you. I'm leaving. You'll get hurt. Didn't you hear me? I said I like you. 1-4-3. I like you. Didn't you hear me? I said you'll get hurt. Let's see. One hundred forty-three, sir. How much? 143? 143. 1-4-3 too. 1-4-3, Ayef? The total amount is on the screen. 1-4-3, sir! 1-4-3. 1-4-3, sir! Mmm! That will be 357, sir! Your change is… One… Four… Three. Thank you. Nice to hear it back from you. - HALAMANNY'S NICE! - NO CUSTOMERS THOUGH. I HOPE AYEF VISITS. Is it closed? Ayef, is that you? Ayef! Ayef. Come in. Welcome to HalaManny! Mmm… Do you like plants so much that you even turned it into a business? Actually, my brother is obsessed with plants. He has been since we were kids. That is why I was influenced as well. I just built this so that I could have a business I could call my own. What is a terrarium? Come look at it. Wait, I'll just set this up. What is that? It's the magical cube. Mmm… Okay, game. Let's start with the base. This is the soil. I'll teach you everything, okay? Why do you make terrariums? Because… I can relate to them. I believe… we are just like terrariums. We can be alone for a period of time. But at some point, we all need to be taken care of… and… to be loved. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Huh? Right. Told you. Want to make another one? Wait, what time is it? It's still early. Huh? It's already late. I might miss the jeepney. Jeep? - Yes, thank you, Manny. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Thank you too. What about your terrariums? I'll just pick them up tomorrow. I'll come again. Thank you, bye. Bye! Hi, Dad! Let's eat. I'll get you a plate. Wait. I have a gift for you. Shorts! Try them. Our neighbor, Ms. Elena, wants me to resell them. She says it can be my side job. There you go again, Dad. I can buy things for myself. You're a big girl already? Yes. As big as that smile on your face? You've had this wide smile since you came in. What are you smiling about? - Mm-mm. - Hmm? Uh… I met someone. Who is it? Who did you meet? What are you two talking about? Ayef said… …she met someone. You know what? You'll really meet a lot of people in the convenience store. Which is good for you because you are an introvert. That is why I also keep telling you to quit animation. You'll gain nothing from that. There's no future there. No money. Waste of time. Waste of energy. That's why, after you graduate, I will submit an application for you to the hotel. Okay? Mom… You know what? Earlier, it was so crazy. Work was so tiring! I just want to get rich so I can relax. One of the bellboys in the hotel is so stupid. He couldn't follow any instructions. He didn't know I would be the one to get in trouble if he messed up. Maybe he didn't understand your instructions. Filemon! What? I'm not asking for your opinion. - No! You want a fight! - I don't want to start a fight. - You're saying I'm wrong! - I don't want to start a fight. You're putting words in my mouth. You're not the one I'm talking to! I was just wondering if the bellboy... You have no right to give an opinion because you don't put food on the table! I'm just saying that your instructions might be... WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TERRARIUM. BUT YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE. Can I top up? Fifty pesos worth, please. Hmm. Oh, my! It seems like she's waiting for someone. You and your imagination! Try writing it in Notepad. Hmph! Deny it all you want. Yes? - Son! - Ma! Wow! I missed you! I missed you! I brought you a gift! Wow! What is this? Hey. Manila traffic is still terrible. Hasn't this country changed for the better? What is this? That is a Red Valentine, Ma. From my new business. Ma… You've been here for a week already? If Viviana hadn't told me I wouldn't even have known... So this is your new business? I'm so proud of you, my son. You haven't even graduated, and yet you're already business-minded! You know what? You take that after your father. Ma, I graduated two years ago. Of course. You've graduated! Now can I get you a drink? Huh? Remember, Ma? You were in Europe during my graduation to unwind. Meanwhile, Dad was at a business summit... This is so nice. You gotta try this. Here you go. Thank you, Ma. So, anyway, my Emmanuel. I got your texts on Dob's birthday party. I just want to make one thing clear, okay? Dobs is your brother, right? Mm-hmm. But he is not my son. That is why I don't want to go to that birthday party. But Mom... I have already moved on and put your dad's infidelities behind me. I don't want to have a flashback moment. So why, oh why, will I have to attend this former cook's son's birthday party? Ma, maybe you forgot. Dobs and I were born on the same day. It's also your son's birthday. It's also my birthday. Anyway, Ma. I'll go ahead. I don't want to disturb you. Thank you for having me. Take care. Anything else? How about me? Want my number? What a snob. Whatever. Sir Manny. Do you know where Ayef is? Dad… Ayef, you're here. Why are you still fixing that? That's broken. Let's just buy a new one on payday. No, I will fix that. I bought you something. Wait, let me get it. Daddy… Dear. This is my account. Mom? Yes? Why is my account logged into here? And why are my emails deleted? I don't know. I used it earlier. Maybe I clicked something. You know I'm not very techy. Wait… And why are only emails from Singapore deleted? Are you trying to stop me from leaving? You know what? I submitted an application for you to the hotel. The pay is good. Mom, I want to work abroad! I don't like it here! You know what? - Eat first, you're overreacting. - Mom this is my life! We're talking about my life! Ayef. Lower your voice. Dad, this may sabotage my application. Dad, please speak up! Filemon, look at your daughter. Look at her. She thinks she knows what she's doing. Are you sure about this? Have you decided? You should actually thank me for looking after you. You make decisions based on a whim. I should know. You can't even take care of yourself, yet you want to live away from us? Mom, it was just one time. I made a mistake. I'm trying to make things right again. You're trying? There's no more time to try. What we need now is to be sure. You wasted so much time already. You wasted so many opportunities. We allowed you to have a boyfriend. We supported you in everything you wanted. And what happened? You did not graduate! It took you two years to finish school! You even promised me… "Mommy, after I finish high school, after I graduate…" Did anything happen? Nothing! When you were doing that, did you think of us? Did we ever cross your mind? Did you think about your dad? You squandered our trust in you! Dad… Don't you trust me either? I admit, I deleted all your Singapore emails. Because I was applying for a job on a cruise ship. It's a good opportunity. The pay is good. It's not as if we can both leave at the same time. If you're all leaving… can we even call this a family? Filemon… If you are going to insist on what you want, then let's just see who gets to leave this hellhole first. That's it. Let it out, Ayef. Whoo! Whoo! Thank you. What a hassle. What happened? My mom's trying to sabotage my application for Singapore. She doesn't trust me anymore. I had my first boyfriend… …when I was graduating high school. Damn, love consumed me. I gave up everything. That's just how I love. Boundaries? What's that, right? Then he just left me. Hassle. I was running for valedictorian. But I lost my chance. Think about it. My parents sacrificed a lot for me. My mom was going to be a lawyer. My dad was going to work abroad. Their plans were ruined when they had me. Sometimes I want to believe that I am the biggest inconvenience in their lives. They weren't able to fulfill their dreams because of me. Maybe that's why I don't deserve to fulfill mine. Sorry, I'm being dramatic. Why are you apologizing to me? Don't think like that. You deserve everything that's meant for you. You're really like a superhero, huh? Always there to save the day. You must have it easy. Not true. For starters, my parents are separated. My mother? She's busy having another life of her own. My dad, on the other hand… He's busy ruining the lives of others. Just tonight, my own mother forgot my birthday. Sorry. We're so dramatic. Let's just eat. Are you sure this is good? That's delicious! What? It's okay. I'm kidding. It's good! But why is it that the people we love hurt us the most? Shouldn't love do the opposite? If it did, I would love more often. A love that's there when you need it. Yes. And which doesn't get mad if you don't reply immediately. A love that doesn't judge, but instead accepts you, flaws and all. And forgives even when you don't apologize. And waits for you to be okay when you've had a crappy day. But never leaves… …when you need it. Right! Love should be like that. Just happiness. No pain. Like us? What if we become a couple? Are you serious? Ayef, my world sucks right now. Really. But… but when I met you, I said to myself, "I'm glad she's here. Because suddenly, it's possible for me to be happy." Me too. I want to be happy. But if we're going to do this, our love should be convenient. As convenient as these cup noodles. But what if we become an inconvenience to one another? We end it. Bye-bye. Game? Game. To make it clear, there must be a written contract. Do's and don'ts. A set of rules. A relationship like a partnership. - No mess. - Mm-hmm. - No fuss. - Exactly! First, I don't like cringey stuff. Don't pick me up. No weeksary and monthsary because we'll never reach an anniversary. 1. NO CRINGINESS Wait! What's wrong with… darling… sweetheart… babe… baby… sugar plum? Are you that edgy? What's wrong is it makes me want to vomit. Number two. Our love should be practical. No gifts. No spoiling each other. I'm not wasting my salary on you. We can't celebrate monthsary and I can't buy you gifts? Damn right. This isn't a grocery. We don't need a month-end report. And lastly, we should practice the 3 Cs. What's that? Number one. Consent. - Consent? No problem. - Yes. First base? Second base? Consent is a must no matter what. This feels like a job application. I'm up for regularization. And if you don't compromise, you'll be up for termination. Okay. Last C. This should be convenient. So my proposal is that our relationship must have a deadline. Manny, we're breaking up in October. Okay? Look at this. Just like these cup noodles. They expire in October. Before it gets spoiled. This love should be quick, easy, and convenient. So? Wait. Those are your rules. Can't I add to them? Remember your second C? Compromise. On the day of our break-up, we'll meet where we first met. - Why? - It'll be sweeter that way. I want a good break-up. With consent and convenience. Fine. Go sign. Mm? Looking forward to us not hurting each other. What's wrong? We're a couple now, right? Everyone! Listen! She's my girlfriend! Ayef's my girlfriend! HELLO! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HEART. Dad, I'm leaving! Eat first. I'm good. Bye! Good morning. What are you doing here? I had a delivery. Anyway, need a ride? Baby? Baby? I don't like pet names, right? Okay, fine. Love. - I really won't go with y... - Okay, fine. I'll stop. I promise. Hmm. - Let's go. - What a snob. There. Choo. Choo? Choo because… I choose you. Thank you. I'll take it from here. - Take care! - Take care, Choo! Take care! Have a great day! Is Manny your boyfriend? Yes, ma'am. Awww. Oh, my… They're here. Hi, Manny! Isn't he your boyfriend? Guys, just order what you want. Eat up! Miss, put it on my tab! We said we'd be practical, remember? No buying each other food. Don't worry, I won't treat you. Just them. I'll be able to save money! Manny, you're so generous! Morning! Another delivery nearby? Hold this. We said no gifts. Ayef, this isn't a gift. I'm helping the environment. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Pickup for Filemon De Guzman. - Just a moment, ma'am. - Thank you. Hi, sir. Good afternoon. Welcome to EO. That looks good on you, ma'am. Or is that for your boyfriend? Does it look good on me, sir? I need to look handsome for my girlfriend. Always. Choo? Manny, you're here! Is he your boyfriend, ma'am? What a beautiful pair! Ma'am, here are your glasses. Thank you. Morning. Happy monthsary. - Let's go. - Okay. You look good together. Happy monthsary. Choo… what are you doing here? Ben 1 left this at the store. Hey! Are you okay? You look sick. Good thing I have medicine. Ben 2, get a glass of water. Here. - Water. - There. I feel better, thank you so much. They don't have paracetamol... Ayef? - What are you doing here? - You forgot your receipt. Take care. Bye! Gotta go. Thank you very much, ma'am. Please come again. - Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you, ma'am. Wow, Dobs! This is amazing! You drew all of these, Dobs? Don't worry, Choo. He's not mad at you. Dobs has ASD so he has difficulty communicating with other people. But we're practicing. Nothing's impossible, right? Ben 2, do you have paper? There. Thank you. May I borrow this? Thanks. Dobs, may I join you? - Let me see. - Looks amazing. Let me see your sketch. Great, isn't it? Ayef? Yes? May I see your work? Of course! Here. You're good at drawing too. Ayef, come to my birthday party, okay? I'm turning 22. I have the same birthday as Manny. We have roasted pig, cake, and a whole lot more because we're rich. I want that too. Let's display this there. Sure. Do you want to be my best friend? I want to have a best friend who's good at drawing. Sure, Dobs. Of course. I'd love that. Manny heart Ayef? I want that too. Did Dobs get home safe? He didn't want to go home. Looks like he really enjoyed this day. You know, he's really good. I know. That's why I want him to go to college. But my dad doesn't want it. He said Dobs will just have a hard time. But I will fight for Dobs. I'm just waiting for our birthday. I plan to announce my plans there. I'll take care of Dobs. I will enroll him. What if he gets mad? I will do everything for Dobs. Everything. That's how I love. You have a huge crush on me, don't you? Don't be too obvious. You're so full of yourself. Whatever. The rain is crazy. I should've gone home earlier. What a hassle. Sorry for the inconvenience. What are we going to do now? I'm the reason for this inconvenience. - So, are we breaking up now? - Huh? You already hassled me, but you're calling it off? What about you? Are you willing to be inconvenienced for me? It's over. Let's break up. Oh well. Hey! You want me to be inconvenienced, right? What are you doing? Come back here! Ayef, this is such a hassle! What a hassle! Ayef, I'm cold! Okay, fine! Never mind then! Okay. Now what? Nothing. Except look at you. That's enough for me. Really? I can stare at you all night. What about you? All night. All day. And every single day for the rest of my life. Rain or shine. I can stare at you forever. Let's go, Ayef! What happened? Why do we have an emergency meeting? You don't know? Your father finally raised our salary. That's good, right? It's in our favor. He raised our salary by a hundred, but he removed all our benefits! We are underpaid. How can we provide for our families? Your father is evil! Hello, ma'am? Ayef, congrats! You're scheduled for a final interview in Singapore! When? You're scheduled tomorrow. Tomorrow? Prepare now. They will email you immediately. Once you pass, you'll go to Singapore! Thank you, ma'am. This is it. I'm finally going to Singapore. Okay, I will update you. Okay, ma'am. Dear? You got an interview for Singapore? - Yes, Dad. - Singapore! Singapore! - I can fit in your suitcase. - Of course. - Singapore! - Singapore. Congrats, Ayef. I'm so excited for you. I'll prepare your things. Thank you. Dad? Manny. I didn't know you were… gonna be here. No one knows when he's gonna be here. Even Auntie doesn't know. I'll be surprised if she does. Manny. Your funny little brother was showing me this funny little clip. And he was pointing at this guy here in this stupid costume. He said this is you. Your brother is so funny. His head is up in space. Ah, Agnes… In your opinion, does Manny think that he can be better than his dad? And if that's the case, then sadly, I must say, he is wrong... That's really Manny, Dad. You might have poor eyesight. - Dobs. - I read that when you grow old, you'll have poor eyesight. Then you'll be hospitalized... Shut up! Dad. You know what? I'd better go. I have to deal with my workers. HI CHOO, ARE YOU OFF WORK? Madam is asking if we can do OT tonight. I HAVE ERRANDS TONIGHT… I'm sure we're not going to get paid for it. CAN YOU COME WITH ME? Right? Or she might pay with pizza again. SORRY CHOO, I JUST REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. It's not like we can cash those pizza slices. WHERE ARE YOU? Sissy, I'm so tired of being poor. I can't take it. Sissy… Can you cover for my OT? I have plans. I can't do OT. Wait. Where are you going? This is a first. - I made plans with Manny. - Oh, wow. Whatever, Ayef. You're pissing me off. Enjoy yourself and take care. Give my regards to Manny. Go ahead. I'll be at your station. Shall we go? I know how to make you happy. Why don't we eat first? Do you want me to cook for you? How? Come here, take a seat. Ooh, it's hot. Ouch! Here you go. Here's your beef stew. Taste it. This is so delicious. Are the kids asleep? Because if they are… We can finally… watch a movie and chill. - Here. It's going down. - Here it comes. I think you need a shower. Where's our bathroom? Let's go. Choo? Can you hand me the towel? Mm. Wanna join me? Catch me first. Come here. It's so fun in here, it's like a playground. Are you okay now? As long as you're here. Whatever. This is so beautiful. You know what? If I will have my own room in Singapore, I bet it will look like this. These curtains, these cute lights, and this soft and fluffy bed. A mini table just like that because I'll be busy. This is enough for me. Hello. Hi, Choo. What's taking you so long to answer? Are you busy there in Singapore? Have you replaced me? You're crazy. I'm busy because I'm one of the youngest animators in Singapore. Is that so? Come home. The ticket is expensive. Why? If I stay longer, will you wait for me? It depends. Why do you say so? I'm missing you so much. I'd just go there. Do you think I'm meant for Singapore? I'm scared that I won't make it. Choo? Choo. Of course... Of course you can. This is all for you. You're meant to be here. I will be your number one supporter. I'll always be rooting for you. To be honest, I'm scared. I don't know if I'll make it without you. Ayef… is it possible to try… to… to cancel our expiration? And… have a contract extension instead? Sir, do you have an Ikea family card? Yes, I do. Do you want more? I'll pour you some. I'm fine. I don't know if I'm dizzy or if my eyes are just tired. Manny… I'm dizzy. Wait, Choo. Hey! - Ayef. Not in there. - No. - What are you doing? Let's go to the sofa. - I'm okay here. Stop it. - We drank mom's alcoholic drink. - No! Ayef, sorry. Relax. Stay here. If my mom finds out I'm in a jacuzzi with a boy? You'll be in trouble. She'll pull my hair out for sure. But how will she do that? She's not even talking to me. Ayef… Mm? You're drunk. When… When I get drunk, I'm more fearless. Why are you laughing? I'm serious. I have to tell you something. Come closer. I said come closer. Come here. You know what? Once we're done, when our contract expires… I'll be sad. I'm happy when I'm with you. I wish this night would never end. Careful with your head. That's it. Just there. You know, I was having the worst day earlier. I'm glad you came. Everything feels right when you're here. I also have a secret. I have secretly fallen in love with you. I… Love… you. And I am secretly hoping… that you have fallen in love with me too. Ms. De Guzman, good day. We're the panel for the interview today. Because of your impressive body of work, and high recommendation from your professor… we scheduled this interview immediately. Tell us about this little project of yours. Okay, ma'am, so the inspiration behind this project is… Ms. De Guzman? Is everything all right? Yes, ma'am. As I was saying, the inspiration behind this project is about... Sorry, Choo, are you already in the interview? Ms. De Guzman, are you still interested in this opportunity? Yes, ma'am, of course. Ah, I promise, no more distractions. Just give me this one chance, please. So now that you're really ready, focus. And start now. Okay, ma'am, thank you. Sis, do you have a problem? Sissy… I'm done with the Singapore interview. Congrats! So proud of you. But I don't know what to do. Huh? You don't know what to do? I know this look. Manny. I don't know how to finish what we've started. You have an expiration date. You will fulfill your dreams. That's your priority. Guys, it's 2022. Everything can work. Why don't you and Manny try an LDR? You'll be in Singapore and he'll be in Manila. If they go long-distance, Ayef's effort and energy for her work and her dreams will be divided. Inconvenient! We don't live in a convenience store. Love. Love can conquer everything. - Love? - Love! - Are you sure about love? - Love! Let me just remind you, Anastacia Filemona De Guzman, that the last time you fell in love, you almost lost everything. You adjusted your life for nothing. Sis, you're not the same girl. You're now a smart girl. Lessons should be learned. Exactly. She's smart. That's why she loves Manny. Do you really believe Kookie's love advice? She can't even break up with her abusive boyfriend. - Don't be like that. - Why? Jobert, you're crossing the line. I'm just stating facts. Stop encouraging her. Because Manny is worth it. Is he really? Are you okay? Let's go. They're here. - Manny! - Happy birthday. Oy, oy, oy, Happy birthday, Dobs. Here's our gift. Thank you, Ayef. Choo, meet my family. Welcome. Please, join us. Enjoy the food. Thank you. Ayef. I'd like to get to know you more. How did the two of you meet? Come on, tell us. Actually, it was totally unexpected because we met at a rally. And then... Rally? - The one… - Ah… …against Siena Corp? - Dad, it's… - It's interesting. You've got quite a beautiful love story. Love story? Whose love story? Ma? Interesting. Who prepared all this? I did. Oh. - Ma. - Mm? I'm just having fun, come on. This is your birthday. - Happy birthday, darling. - Thank you, Mom. Oh. And you are? Ayef, ma'am. Ayef. If you arrived on time, you wouldn't even have to ask her that. Is that a good evening from my cheating ex-husband? Mom? We have guests. Come on. If Ayef is going to be part of the family, I think it's best that she knows the true colors of our family. Yes? All right, I'll tell you. So that you won't be confused the whole night. Let's just say, I am Eve. Okay? And that man is Adam. The woman, she is the snake. And the boy next to her… That is the forbidden fruit. Poison. Shut up, Meryl! What? I'm just telling the story of your love affair in the most creative way. People love mistress stories. Do you agree with me, Agnes? You come here, you mess up everybody's evening… You know what? You're really crazy. I'm crazy? I don't think so. - Do you want me to tell you who's crazy? - Ma, I want cake, Mama. See? Do you want me to tell you who's crazy? I can tell you straight away. Actually, I don't even have to say a word. That's my cue. I'll just see you at the office tomorrow, Manny. What? At the office?! What, you work for your father now? He will. - Dad? - What? This is not an option. This is my command. And you grow up, young man. Stop fighting the business that feeds you. And stop insisting on enrolling your brother. You're just wasting my money. No ifs! No buts! And you shut down that plant shop of yours immediately. Is that what you want Manny? Manny? Manny, is that what you want? And finally, stop meeting up with people who are not good for you. No, you do not tell him who to see and who he cannot see! Yes, he will! Manny, come on! Mom, Dad, please stop it! Can't you just please, for once? It's Manny's birthday. Well, Manny, happy birthday. And everybody, I'm done here. Well, go! - No one wants you here anyway. - Stop it, everyone! Wait, Manny. Manny, it hurts. Sorry. I just want to get out of here. Where do you want to go? Just tell me. Anywhere. Let's go. Manny… Choo, I'm sorry about tonight, okay? I'm sorry about Dad. Don't mind him, okay? You're good for me. Do you want to say something? Sorry. I want to breathe. I need space. Wait. I'm confused. So am I. Confused. Afraid. I thought… Ayef, I understand tonight was upsetting. It really was, okay? Even for me. I'm here. I'm here whenever you need me, okay? Sorry. Sorry, Manny. I'm scared. Ayef… There are so many questions in my head. If he can't fight for himself, how can he fight for us? What will happen when I leave? What if things get worse? I am almost willing to give up everything. Everything. Just to be with you. So I can stay here with you. I'll forget Singapore. Because in the end, everything will be worth it, right? But I'm not worth it? I can't. I don't want us to be like my parents. I don't want us to fight every day. I don't want to lose my respect for you, Manny. I don't want the time to come that we regret we chose each other. I'm scared. Because I don't know how to love without hurting each other. Just tell me I'm not worth it. And that you want a way out of this relationship. We agreed to this relationship with eyes wide open. That if this becomes an inconvenience, we'll break up. Manny, you agreed to that, right? Because I want to be with you. I want to be with you. And now what? I'm an inconvenience to you... Because I love you, Manny. I love you! You only love me when we're happy. Manny… You only want me when everything is okay. But now you know the truth about the real me, all of my problems, my weaknesses, you'll just bail. You hide behind your dreams… Your fears. Your pain. You have too many excuses, Ayef. But the truth is… you're a coward too. Because you want a love… a perfect love that doesn't exist. Do you want this contract? Here's our contract. You want to follow the contract? Okay. You want a convenient love? A love that will only bring you happiness? Ayef, there's no such thing. Sorry, I tried. But here we are. The reality is, this is me. I'm sorry I'm an inconvenience. What is this new business idea, Filemon? A thrift shop? Can that feed us? What a damn life. I said stop it! Let's end this. If that's what will make you happy. I know every sacrifice you made for this family. I carry all of them inside my heart. Sorry if I failed to give you the life I promised. Sorry if I'm not enough. But damn it, Terry. I didn't give up and I never will. I'll do everything I can because I love you so much. It won't always be easy, I can't do everything all the time. But please don't give up on me. Sorry, Ayef. It's okay, Dad. It's okay, Dad. Mom? Dad? Manny, I'll take care of it. Your sister had a cramp, that's why we rushed her to the... What's wrong? I'm so tired, Auntie. Hush now. Mm. There. You look pretty. Just like me. Ayef… I'm not pushing through with my cruise ship application. Let me tell you something. I want to apologize to you. I put all my frustrations onto you and your father. I only did that because… I want you to have a better life. I didn't realize I was teaching you the wrong way. I hope you forgive me. Ayef… Enjoy your life. Okay? Do everything you want to. If you want to go abroad, or you want to love, and be loved, or even if you do all of that at the same time, I know you can, because you're better than me. You're braver and stronger than me. If you fail, don't be afraid to try again. Hmm? Sorry. I love you, Ayef. Sorry, Mom. Hey! What are you doing with my bag? - Sorry, Dad. Sorry. - You son of a bitch! Damn you! Look at this! Look at what you did! Stop it, Dad. You don't tell me what to do! Dobs, are you okay? You know, I used to believe that I had to be good at something to deserve your love. I used to think no one loved me for who I am. But now I'm gonna do it. And I'm starting with myself. I'm going to love myself. But I hope I make you proud one day. Because even if I'm not the son you wanted, I'm the son who loved you. I hope you understand when I say this… It's not easy being your son. I'm done. I'm leaving with Dobs and Auntie. Let's go, Dobs. So I broke up with him! Congratulations! Good job, Kookie! Congrats! But at the same time… - Shit! - What does it say? I got accepted! In Singapore? Oh my God, sis! I'm so proud of you! Thank you, Lord! - I'm very proud of you. - Congrats, dear. Wait, are you sad? Of course not. I'm just so happy. I wish we were like this every day. Oh, you. - I promise, dear. - Yes, promise, Ayef. Congratulations, dear. Where are you? Ayef will be late. The plane will leave with or without her. What's in your bag? It's so heavy! Hurry up! M-Manny, where's Ayef? - Dobs... - No, it's okay. She said we'd draw together. Dobs… stop looking for Ayef. She's leaving. Ayef is leaving? Her friends told me she's going abroad. Where was it again? Singapore. Because she got accepted into her dream internship. They said she'll leave today. She'll leave today? Tomorrow, October 4. That's what Kookie said. But today is October 4! - October 4, as in the October 4? - No. It's October 3 today. - One, keys. - Yes, boss! - Two, jacket. - Yes, boss! - I'm leaving. - Yes, boss. Take care, sir. The boss left his phone. I love you, Mommy. I'll miss you. - I love you. - Please take care of my daughter. - Sure. - Don't mind my husband. You have your towels, blankets, and extra food. I need to go back. I need to talk to Manny. He needs to know what I feel for him. - Wait. - Dad, I'm getting off this car. Ayef, wait. I promise I'll be there on time. I just can't leave without talking to him. Hi, Auntie! - Good afternoon. - Hey. Is Ayef there? Ayef? Who are you? Oh! I'm Manny. I'm her boyfriend. - Boyfriend? - It's a long story. Is she there? You. - Yes. - Wait. Let's take a selfie, I'll send it to Ayef. I've finally met you. Stop the car. - I'll bring your things to the airport. - Okay. Just make sure you're there before 7:00 p.m. Thank you. Where will you go? In the alley where we first met. - Don't be late, be quick. - Okay, Dad. Wait, my boyfriend is calling. Filemon! Wait, I can't understand you. Ayef is going to where? To the alley where they first met? - Alley? - What? - Alley. She's going there. - Do you know… Bye Auntie, thank you! That can't be! The plane will leave without her. - Thank you, Auntie! - Okay. I'll go now. Not now, please. Ayef. Save the environment! Fight for our future! Hello, Dad? Sorry, please come here. I'm stuck in a rally. I can't book a ride. Ayef? - Ayef? - Save the environment! - Fight for our future! - Okay, Dad, meet me at the corner. - Save the environment! - Ayef? Fight for our future! - Save the environment! - Ayef? Fight for our future! Save the environment! Manny? - Fight for our future! - Manny! Manny! Manny, I'm here. Manny! Are you leaving? How long? Two years. If they hire me, it might be longer. When you get there, take care of yourself. Don't starve yourself. Don't just eat noodles. I heard it's hot there. Always bring an umbrella. When you get there, make sure to tie your shoelaces. You might trip. Sorry. Sorry, I got scared. But, Manny, I can't leave without telling you this. I love you. I won't stop you if you leave. I want you to reach your dreams. Manny, I'll hold on to us. Even if it becomes inconvenient. I will fight for it. Promise. When I'm as brave as you are, I'll be the first one to pick you up. Ayef… One, four, three. I love you. 24-Ever? 2… 4Ever. I love you, Ayef. Ayef, I love you!
