Welcome! Wait there... It's in the front, here. - You can put your things here. - Thank you. - You're from Strasbourg? - That's right. Fine! - What's your name? - Eric. Lovely to meet you, Eric. I'm Marie. Fine! - Like to pay me now, so we can forget about that. - Yes, sure. Otherwise, for 35 euros, go down on you... And for 60 euros, intercourse. - No, that doesn't interest me. - Alright. Can I abuse you? Yeah, but that's more expensive. Do you have a DVD? Yes. Do you want us to try something different? What do you mean? I can teach you things. All sorts of things. Then you can have a lot of fun with your wife or your girlfriend. Don't know. Very well... Listen... Let's just get started... Alright, Eric? - It won't cost you any more. - Alright. - You can take your pants off. - Yes... sure. "Eric, premature ejeculator, very uptight. "Sucked off. 45 euros." What the hell is he doing? Hello, this is Adrien. Please leave a message. Adrien! Hey, I'm waiting here for you! What are you up to? Call me back. Do you have to honk your horn like that? Oh, shut up! Fuck it, now I really am pissed off! Adrien! Adrien! Come on then! I tried calling you umpteen times! I did call to say that I'd be late. I wasn't able to answer. Same for me... I couldn't. You got fired. You don't work. And still you're late. It's hardly the same. So I don't have any right to have a life? No, you don't have any right. - Don't start yelling at me! - There's no reason for you to be late. All right! All right! You live with your parents? In a student residence. Do you work, madam? She works from home as a hairdresser. Fine. Why were you expelled from the hotel school? I put some pot in the mousse... and Mr Cochet ate it. Pardon? I put some pot in the chocolate mousse. That's awfully serious. It was a useless course anyway. The food was reheated. There's no point looking for another professional course. Your dismissal is on your record. Anyway I doubt you could start in a school in September. In the middle of the year it's impossible. How come? There are no cookery-course vacancies. Where might there be vacancies? Do you like sport? Yes, I do a bit of bodybuilding. How about a security-guard course? It's a diploma course with less writing requirements. You can get a diploma for that? Is that of any interest? Can't say. How about reading parking meters? No. Being a security guard is hardly a sport. Don't fool him. A dismissal, average school results... doesn't let him be demanding, madam. Otherwise, there's road transport. That's not possible. He gets car-sick. Throws up everywhere. Anything else? She's right... I wouldn't want that. Would you like your son to be a truck driver? Everyone has the occupation they can handle, madam. You like being a hairdresser, but others wouldn't. The same applies to your son. I find it hard to believe that in Strasbourg... ...there is no establishment with a cookery position. - There must be... - Security diploma... 2nd chance. Do you set out to depress people? Honestly! Security diploma?! Have you noticed his physique? I'm offering you some solutions. Fantastic solution! So, what is your solution? It sucks! Let's go... Honestly! Adrien, you don't have to... We're going... This woman's dangerous. It's alright... Go home to your mother. Don't you lecture us! Honestly! Goodbye, ma'am. What are you going to do next year? You'll lose the housing subsidy. I can't pay. - You worry too much. - Of course I worry! So what will you do? I'll join the army. Did Nathan put that idea in your head? I thought he was expelled. No, he was just suspended. You wanted to be a chef. Now the army. Any connection? Didn't you hear her? There are no cookery vacancies. So? We'll find something else. You get trained... I'd get to drive tanks. Tank driver? You're getting delirious. Why not? It pays 1,372 euros a month, plus bed, board and laundry. You want to go to war? I'm not going to make war. Soldiers make war. If I'm in Djibouti... There's no war in Djibouti. If they send forces there, it means it's dangerous. If I'm in my tank, I'll be protected. You really are off with the fairies. Do you believe your video games are real? What about it? Anyway, you're 17, and you'll do as I say. - Oh yeah? - The army is out of the question. They recruit... You're not needed. - You're not joining the army. - Yes I am. - I am. - You're not. - You're not. - Oh yes I am. - You're not. - We'll see about that. Hi! Bloody hell! It's still just as good. I'm happy when you're happy. - Here... - Ta. Even on holiday, I was doing work. Building an extension to our place, doing up the garage, or the garden... Now that our kids have grown, she really pisses me off. What can I do? Well, being a couple has never been my thing. Yes of course. But I respect the idea. Half of my clients are married. Really? That for me? What is it? Is that all it does for you? I like it, it's funny. Thank you. Have you tried Perrandier, for your son? It's a school for kids who want to become chefs. My nephew went there. It's great. Really? Is it in Strasbourg? Yes, it's very well known. They have a campus. You don't know it? It's the top school. They'll never take Adrien. He is super-talented but not at all academic. My nephew was hopeless at school. - Really? - Yeah. It's not your regular high school. They have other criteria. It's privately run, so it doesn't work the same. So how does it operate? Well... you have to pay. Yes, I guess you would. - Ferrandier? - Perrandier. Perrandier. Terrific. I'll look into it. Thank you. My pleasure. So, see you next Wednesday? Yeah, I'll call you. Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Hi, kids. - Hi, ma'am. - Enjoying yourselves? - Fine thanks. Found your training course? Yeah, we give a little helping hand. Yes, so I see. Look at me! All the bullshit I have to put up with! Like something to drink? Yes, a matcha tea, please. We don't have that. We have Coke or Red Bull. Don't worry. Thanks. How's the army going? It's going well. You serve the flag, weekdays and get high on the weekend? Do you know the school? No not at all. That's what I thought. Just a moment. Here we are... Take this. You have everything there, for making an application. Do you need school report cards? No not at all. Recruitment is based on application and individual interview. What's the interview? It's to assess the motivation of the candidate. And about the 9,000 euros... Is that for everyone... or do scholarship holders pay less? There are no scholarships here. On the other hand, if Adrien is admitted... ...he can take out a student loan. It's adopted by many of our students. It works very well. Is the 100 euro enrollment fee included in the 9,000? No, it's additional. Alright. Your fees are gold-plated! They're to cover the costs of the interview. Very well. Maybe you have some other questions? Adrien? - No. - No. I'll see you out. Adrien, if you'll allow me... Regarding the application file... Think about it carefully... ...for it requires a covering letter, which is important. - OK. - Read it carefully... Take your time. We'll take care of it. Excellent! - Thanks very much. - You're welcome. This is for the bourgeoisie, not for us. It's for everyone. Alright?! Isn't it a good school? - Well? - Yes. If you pass the interview, we'll see afterward. They won't take me. It's not for me. You don't know! If they're accepting to see US... They accept to see anyone. If we'd had no chance... She doesn't give a damn! - We're leaving. - Adrien! Why do you have to be so negative? You always believe we'll succeed. Just TRY, before you say it's impossible - Do you want to be a chef? - Yes. Alright, give it a try and that's it. We'll make 50 small ones. STOP HYPOCRISY NOT OUR CLIENTS Camille... Have you ever done a covering letter? Sure. "I'd like to suck you off for the maximum rate." "Greetings to your wife." You're silly... Seriously, it's for Adrien's school. Ask the lawyer. Oh yes, thanks. "Dear Sir/Madam... I'm asking you, because... "I’d like to join your school." And you carry on about the school. Then you tell his life story. "I've always loved cream, and chives..." "...and I dream about sauerkraut at night... bla bla bla." Then you have to put in something personal that he's done. They ask about experience. That's just it... he has no experience. What does he know how to do? He's terrific at making crepes. That's great. So say... "This school would give me the opportunity..." "...to evolve among the best..." "...and receive training of the highest quality." - Etc... etc... - Yeah. I don't know if I'll succeed in composing it as well as you do. Give me the paperwork... I'll do his letter. You can pay me in crepes later. You're wonderful, thank you! I have one other request. What's that? I don't want to talk to him. Don't be silly! He's a lawyer... he's studied. Someone who'll help me? He's a tranny. So what? He has an honours degree. He's done lots of interviews. He's written your covering letter. You always come up with dopey ideas. Mary, I'm going. I'll come back for the pancakes. I get insulted all day long. Not on overtime, even for you. It's not you, that he has it in for... it's me. Please stay. I'm vile. Not at all... you're great. It's just so he'll focus... It bothers him to see you as a woman. I have my breaking point, too. Come on, he's ready for you. Adrien... ...here's your examiner. Hi. You say hello too. The interview has started. Hi. So put your phone away. So... So what are your motivations? Why do you want to enroll at this school? It's not my idea... it's hers. Adrien, you can't start like that. Please! You've already been expelled. Why would it be any different? That's the end of it! - Hear what he said?! - So what? Calm down! He's here to help you. It takes time. Come on, play the game. You have to be prepared for that question. If it goes badly because of a client, and he comes back... ...I want to know why it will be different. High school was a shithole. Alright, but you can say it in a different way. "The teaching wasn't up to the level of my expectations." Okay? Why come to this school? Because I like this stuff. - Cookery? - Yeah. That's fine, but you have to give more. I know, but I just don't know how to say to YOU. Why do you like to cook? I've no idea! Take your time... You're replying without thinking. Come on, Adrien, make an effort, damn it! If you don't know, make something up! You're making up some sort of nonsense all day long! And now here you say nothing? Great! Pull your finger out! Marie... Don't start yelling... It achieves nothing. I dunno... I like to cook, that's all. Great, terrific answer. Marie! Either you go out... but if you stay, you... ...help me... but you're doing just the opposite. When was it you started wanting to cook? I'm telling you I don't know! Why are you a tranny? I always loved dressing up as a girl. Since I was little. I did it at my grandma's... She raised me. I studied law... It was very expensive, so I prostituted myself. So here I am. I've no idea. I've no idea. I've no idea. I found a cookbook. I don't know why, but... I wanted to look inside. I really loved... I really loved looking at the pictures... ...and reading the recipes. So I wanted to try. I made an apple pie. I succeeded. I felt happy. I threw it all away... I wasn't allowed to use the oven. You see? That's what you have to say. They asked him for a recipe... ...and he came out with Salmon Aumoniere. It was a knockout. They'd have take him, wouldn't they? Frankly, he is hyper-motivated. He cooks very well. I believe he'll become a truly very great chef. Really! Slow down, there are two there. They were 10 of them... And it was unanimous. Good evening, it's for the demo to Parliament on Saturday. - The what? - The demo. It's important you come. We're demanding that our clients not be penalised. To stop hiding. Here are some leaflets... You round up the girls. - See you on Saturday! - Thanks. Goodbye. This Saturday... Don't forget! It's there on paper... They know how to read. Still have to explain, talk to them. Otherwise they don't care. This school is expensive. but frankly... ...it's worth it. It's an opportunity. He'll meet new people. The teachers look demented. There are super-cute girls... ...who look, wow! Bugger! It's always really creepy here.. - Phew! - Coming? No, I'm not moving. I don't do blacks. Don't start... Why would they want to protest with us? Because they're whores, like us. No, they're slaves in the pay of their pimp. They steal our customers. They're victims. Sure! I'm a victim, because they force prices down. Stop only thinking about yourself. No way! I went to demonstrate... ...so they could do their stuff in their filthy vans. When it involves us, they never come. So... that's that. Here's one. Looks like Martin! What? Yeah, my Martin. The pharmacist. Fuck it... wait. Fuck it, it IS him! It's him! He comes every Wednesday... ...when his wife goes to see her sick mother. He's quite a hunk, your guy! Bugger! I didn't understand... He was only coming every fortnight. Now you know... He likes some variety. Thinking about the present he gave me... It was a total piece of crap! What an arsehole! Now you're getting sentimental. I can't understand anything on their shitty website. Forget it, they won't accept me. I'm sick of you saying you'll never make it! But it's true... the others are better. They're just as hopeless as you. You have to pay to get in. That's all that matters. I'll try and call them. They won't answer... Stop eating this stuff. I've told you before... it's too much sugar. Yes? We're trying to find results on the Internet... ...and it's not working. It keeps sending me back to the password... Alright. So it's a problem with the website. So... it's Adrien Kriegel. K-R-I-E-G-E-L. Alright, I'll be patient. Aren't you going to tidy up that cheese rind? Later. Yes? Alright. Thank you, madam. Thank you very much. - Fuck! - What? You got in! Seriously? - No. - I was sure of it. - I got into Perrandier? - You got into Perrandier! 5 years since the law was passed, and now we have lower prices. The client takes risks, so he sets the conditions. We have to stay out of sight, hustling in deserted places... ...where we're in danger. We're only doing our job. We're not harming anyone. That's the message we've come with. Where, when, what may be my fee...? Those choices are only mine? My body belongs to me!? - What do you want? - The repeal of the law. Prostitution is tolerated... but they want to make us invisible. You sleep with us, But you vote against us? We're here, we'll always be here. We exist! We'll take care of it! Don't set us free? Proud to be a whore Neither guilty nor victim? Look how you've grown! Come and warm up. Come on, Ripou! You still remember? Show us. - You've done it a few times. - Yeah. Yes! Bravo! Great! Adrien's difficult at the moment. I had to drag him to come here. He's young. If he makes it at that school, he'll be fine. I'm sure. He'll become a great chef. I'd really love that. But gosh, the school is so expensive. Right now, I don't have enough. So how'll you manage it? That's just it... I really don't know. You couldn't lend me some money, could you? Really, Marie... you can't ask us. We've already given money for our grandson. Remember Antoine? He came on weekends when Adrien was with us. But no... it's simply impossible. I understand. Anyway, are things okay with you? Oh yeah. But... don't you really want to change what you do? Well, no. Not at all. I'm fine as things are. - You could... - Have any sugar? Don't you like me talking about it? You could've chosen another occupation. Well, yeah... But we do what we can. She said to me... "Here's 20 euros, I can't pay for school." As if I were some street-bum. I'm not asking them to give me money, but to lend it to me. - It's the same. - It's not! That school's not for us... We're not going to beg, Mum! It most definitely IS for us! That you were able to get in, is the proof. I don't care about Mum and Dad's lessons in morality, OK? I'm going to pay for this school for you. - It's not for us. - I'll pay it. I don’t need it from anyone. Certainly not from them. It'll be OK. Hold on! The jams. - 'Bye. - 'Bye. I'll call you. Hello. Mrs Kriegel? - Yes? - Will you come with me? - Mr Solanas isn't here? - He's taken his retirement. Alright. Don't worry, I have all the files. - And you are? - Mr Wino. Alright, pleased to meet you. It's a selective school. It's hard to get into. He's been accepted. - Great. Congratulations. - Thank you. It's no great surprise... He's very, good at cooking. You see, the school is Perrandier. Sounds familiar. It's the best. But it's private, so it's expensive. All up, it costs 9,000 euros. I have to pay a deposit of 5,000 in two months That's why I've come to see you. Your income is quite irregular. I make roughly between... 1,200 and 1,500 per month. And your outgoings? I pay 350 in rent. I have the student residence at 400 but I get the APL of 200. It's for my son... not for me. I also need to examine what you charge. - Are you on CDI? - No. - CDD? - No. Are you a permanent temp? I'm independent. I'm a prostitute. Very well... How does it happen? Sorry... What I mean is... I mean... You don't have pay slips? No. No, but I have my tax return... ...that I brought you. The problem is that your income is too dependent on your charges. I'm sorry. What if I earned more? You'll have to bring me your next tax statement. But the start of the school year is in January. I have to make the payment by December 19. Sorry, the debt-ratio maximum is 33 percent. It doesn't match your income. This is a personal loan... ...which is not backed by property which could be mortgaged.. And a student loan? You need a guarantor. Is there anyone in your family who could go guarantor? No. There's only me. I understand, ma'am... Given your situation, we're obliged to have a guarantor. Of course. Think about if there's someone who could take that role. - Even someone unrelated. - Thank you. I'll see you out. No, that's alright, thank you. Adrien? Adrien! Have you seen Adrien Kriegel? - No Ma'am. - Sorry. Adrien? Oh, fuck... Hello, this is Adrien. Leave me a message. Where were you? What the fuck are you doing here? Where were you? In Kehl. For three days? Yeah. Where did you sleep? Well... at the hotel. Alright. Can you explain this to me? What the hell were you thinking? Eh? What do you plan to do? Don't yell at me! I've a headache. It's OK. I'll yell all I want! You drive me up the wall with your damn stupidity! What are you doing? What are your plans? Firstly, I'm going to bed. You pissed me off. Goodnight. Adrien! - Come on, I'm not kidding. - Let go of me! Let go of me, I tell you! What is it do you want? I can't stay without doing something. If I do nothing, he'll go on like this. I just don't know how far he'll go. I've no control over him. How long has he been smoking? No idea. I have to get him out of there... Out of that shitty environment. It's essential he goes to that school. How can you come up with 9,000 in two months? The first installment is 5,000, and... I have 1,000. If I go to Bruno's in Offenbourg, I'll have 4,000. You're not going to Bruno's. My God, Bruno's! I'm not saying I'd be thrilled, but if I have to... Hey, this place of yours is great. Wow! The man has really moved up the ladder. Just what do you want? I need you to take me on. Do you speak German? Ich bin in Strassenburg gerboren. - English? - Yes, of course, my dear. Show me your dick. Italiano. Venite con me! We don't get Italians. Germans, of course. Guys from the east who come to work here... ...and who leave their wives over there. How old are you? 35. Don't show it, eh? Listen... You are a very beautiful woman. You have a lot of experience. But I don't need girls like you. Bruno, hey... You'd be well aware that not everyone wants a young blonde. But in your category, I already have Joy and Greta. Joy, Greta... Are they Germans? Do you have a French girl? No. Come on, Bruno... This temple of love... ...and no sample of French charm? I worked 3 years in Pigalle. Look at me. 39, and the best legs in Alsace. Wait, listen... I don't give a fuck about your age which changes every minute... Did you know I won the Miss Lorraine regional competition? I'm not going to lie to you... I really need the job. You won't be disappointed. I'll take you on trial for a week, to see if it works. Thank you. If I have any complaints about you, for any reason... ...you're out the door. - OK. - And... ...I don't know you at Altromondo... - You'll answer to Tatiana. - Alright. Tati! Come here. Marie, Tatiana. Tatiana, Marie. - Hello. - Hello. She's going to work here. Will you show her the ropes? Have you ever worked in a club? - Yes, of course. - Whereabouts? Here in Germany. What town? Hamburg. Photos of girls who work at the club. You need a photo. OK. Can you pole dance? Well... a bit. You worked in a club without pole dancing? Yes, I did, but... There's the jacuzzi. OK. The only constraint that we set... ...is that it's 60 euro for a standard service. You're self-employed... you pay 120 euros a night. This includes club rental, a bedroom, jacuzzi. Ronan does security. You'll be safe, no problem. 120 euros a night is a lot. If you work well, you can do 3 to 6 clients a night. Each customer who buys a bottle, it's 20 percent to you. There is Taj Mahal. There, it's Lotus. There for gang-bangs. There can be 5. That pays off well. Yeah. Are you going to sleep here? It's 80 euros a week. No, I'll go home. All those round trips, you’ll be tired. Too bad. As you wish. Well... come on! - Put your things away. - Where? There is a wardrobe and the clothes rail. Adrien, listen to me. I'll pay Perrandier. Did you get a loan? I want you to participate. I won't go into debt for you to do nothing. I'd like you find a little job. McDonalds, pizza delivery... whatever. Out of which you can pay your phone... ...contribute to the rent and the food. You live here. This way we save on residence money. I'm going to work elsewhere. Where will you go? Offenbourg. Why? It's too difficult here with the cops. So... It's October 29. The start of the school year is January 4. I pay you for your studies, you work to participate. It's very important. Okay? It's your last chance. Don't throw it away. Yoo hoo! Are you going to look at me and answer? This is the deal... I pay for your studies, you participate. - OK? - OK. Hey everyone. - Keep your things there. - OK. Girls! This is Marie. Marie... Joy, Awa, who speaks French, Greta, Sofia, Encarna... I'll get your key. Thank you. Hi. Hi. You're the new girl, Marie? Glad to meet you. Welcome. I'm Encarna. See that guy? Yes. That's Gustav, Terrific client. You should go. You go. What? Why don't you go? I have a reservation, but you do as you like. Hello guys. Hello. OK. Hey! No, stop! Stop! You touch, you pay! If you touch, you pay, my friend. Marie. You did 5 clients, right? Great...! Good start. Thanks. You've got 2 bottles? 2 bottles is 50. OK. There's your contract. - You bring it back to me signed. - Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for Gustav and Co. Don't mention it. If you do it again, I kill you. What? I break your teeth. You understand. Good morning, it's 6.30, Here's the weather report. Hi. How much? 45 blow job, 80 intercourse. - 25? - No. - 30? - No way. Creep. Awa, how much are you making here? Over 3,000. - You live here? - Yeah. Do we have to dress up? No, only on Mondays. It's a dress-up evening. No, it's impossible... What? There is a problem? How depressing! Miss America! Miss Spain. Come in. Thanks for the kid. He lasted 22 seconds. So much the better. Come with me. Where to? I have a good idea. OK. He's asleep. Give me a condom. Yeah, please. Not too much. Stir it. - Chin. - Chin. Fucking hell...! Makes a change from the Moldavians that Encarna palmed off onto me. She's a bitch. You have to be wary of Serbs. Isn't she Spanish? She took on a Spanish name for the customers. She's a Serb. Like Greta, she's Russian, not German. - Is that true? - Sure. Alright. What about you? I'm not Moroccan. Are you Norwegian? That's it. What do you make a month? About 2,500. Really? No more? Even less, with the rent. More than 3,000? Look at our customers. More than 3,000? Look at our clients. Students, workers, riff-raff. There's no one with money. Oh, fuck... No, I really thought I was going to make more here. Can I talk to you, Mary? Come. I'm with a client, I'll come. Excuse me, can you spare Marie for a second? I'm coming. OK, you wait for me. - Yes. - I come back. Fuck you, I'm with a client! You scammed a client! Which client? Do you think you can do whatever you want? Oh, great! - He fell asleep, ask Sofia. - I'm not here to argue. I tell you what to do. Next time, you're out of here. I don't care if you're a friend of Bruno's... you're out! [Véronique Sanson: Vancouver] What are you doing? - I'm fed up, Adrien! - Let me sleep. No! This wasn't the deal... You were to be looking for a job. You're not a kid anymore, you piece of shit! I'm sick of kicking you out of bed every morning! What's it matter if I'm looking for a job at 11 o'clock? It matters a lot! You should be at the job centre door, with your CV. - You're pissing me off! - You too! Fuck it! You better do it... I'll check tonight before leaving. I'm fed up, damn it! 45 blow-job and 80 intercourse. The Perrandier School. Hello, madam... I'm calling regarding Adrien Kriegel. It's to inform you that... ...I've had a bit of a setback... ...but the payment will be made soon. Has the payment been made or not? Not yet, but I will. I had a setback at work. Okay, the deadline is December 19. - Two weeks before the start of the school year. - Yes. If the payment is late... ...another student on the waiting list will take the place. I know, but my son was selected. He passed the oral... I'll speak to management, but to be honest... ...we've had precedents and there are no exceptions. In the past, students enrolled, didn't pay or didn't turn up. They block a place that we have on the list. Yes I know. But if I made you a payment of 3,000 euros...? The first installment is 5,000 euros. I know but... I make you a payment of 3,000 euros... ...and I pay the rest after school starts. 3,000 euros to show the place wasn't taken for nothing. No, that's not possible. Can't you talk to the manager about it? I'll pass on the information, but make the payment as soon as possible. Alright. OK, thank you. Goodbye. Fuck it! That arsehole Bruno doesn't want to put me back on the website. He's really starting to piss me off. The cops were here yesterday. They took Awa. Really? Why? She was an illegal. Oh shit! What'll happen to her? They'll most likely deport her. Girls! Who can help me? It's for Awa. I need an address to send her stuff to. Can you help me, Marie? Can you help me fold the sheet? Alright, I'll do that later. What school does your son go to? - Ronan told you about my son? - No, it was Bruno. What did he say? That he was going to go to some great school. He's going to Perrandier. To become a chef. - What sort? - Cooking. Congratulations. It's nice, what you're doing for him. My son's growing up far away from me. I'll be back. Well, that seems to be it... Do you still need me? - No, that's fine. You can go. - OK. I'll look for the address tomorrow. I've have a long drive. I'm dead beat. See you tomorrow. - Are you drunk, Marie? - You OK, Marie? Don't bother, she's in love. Marie... there you are. I you sure you're not taking young ones? I told you no. Calm down... there's one of them waiting for you. I told him, but he insisted. Can you tell him? - Alright. - OK. What the hell are you doing here? Nathan saw you on the website. I came to see. You lied to me. - You talk rubbish to me. - Stop it! You say you're independent... that you do what you want. Look at you... A slave just like the others. We'll go outside. We can talk outside, alright? Coming? No. - Get off me! - Come on! As you wish. - Let me go! - Stop, Adrien! - Let go of me I said! - Take it easy. - Let me go! - It's alright, Ronan. - You sure? - Yes, it's OK. - Calm down. - Stop it, now. Stop it now... it's OK. Why are you here? For that fucking school? I'm not going there! I just want you to leave me alone! You're just a whore! You disgust me. You disgust me. - Stop. - Let go of me. Adrien, stop it! - Stop it. - Let go of me! Stop being an idiot! - Stop it now! - Let go of me! - What are you doing? - Let go of me! Get up! Don't move! Ronan, stop it! Don't hurt him! - Let go of him! Leave him alone! - I'm calling the police. Let go of him! Are you a maniac?! He's just a kid. You alright darling? You OK? What I do with my life is my own business. Understood? I'm afraid. I'm just afraid. Shit, I forgot the coffee. No, now what?! Plus the envelope, that's 3,500. Another fortnight at Offenbourg and the 800 from Adrien... ...that's it, we've made it. Pumpkin and pecorino risotto. It's lovely. Did you make it? No, I'm still washing dishes. - It'll come. - Bon appetit! Hi, bitch! How are you? - Awa! - Great to see you! - What are you doing here? - Finally free. They let me out this morning. - You're kidding! How was it possible? - Some association put pressure on. I'll get a real residence permit. - That's fantastic! - Come on, I'm shouting champagne! Come on! Encarna! The girls! Bruno, someone stole my dough. It's not in my room. - Put your money in the bank. - No banks! It was under my mattress. - I don't give a damn. - You don't give a damn? You calm down and take care of the clients. Where's my dough? It was in my room. - So it was me? - You have the key! Awa, stop it! Calm down, Awa! Dirty thief! That's enough. Both of you go upstairs! We'll discuss it later. Go on up! Gentlemen, I apologise. Can I refill your drinks? You scared me! Sorry, I wanted to thank you. You separated us... That was good of you. Don't mention it. I'm used to it. - You got a fag? - Yeah, sure. Just a sec. Here. Was there much? - 1,000 euros. - Oh, fuck... You're a bit silly leaving 1,000 euros like that.. I never thought Tatiana would do that. Dirty Russian. We don't know... If it's found, it's not her. It's her. Nobody else has the keys. It's Tatiana. I'll get my money back. How? I have to send money home for my daughter. She needs it for school... so as not to end up like me. Hello. My envelope! - What? - My envelope. I found my money. All there? Yes.. It wasn't there. Someone put it there tonight. Awa, that's awesome! Did you get your money back? That's great. Damn it, you stole my dough. Pardon? What are you talking about? I told you that I'll take revenge... ...and by magic, I have my money? Hang on, Awa... - You have your money... great! - Don't play with me. She's correct. You took the keys to her room... ...and I did not take any money. Speak in French! You stole her money. - What? - Yes, it's you! No, stop bugging me! - There's no more problem. - You're a thief! There's no problem. Shut up! I've stolen nothing! I haven't stolen anything! Calm down, damn it! You'll be punished! Awa, you're going to kill her. I don't give a fuck. Thief! You're completely nuts. I get attacked by Awa. I get bashed... It's all nonsense... it's madness. I did not take any money. I don't care. You've been here 6 weeks and it's been continual trouble. I don't want you here. Wait, you have no proof. It's my word against Tatiana's. Maybe she took the money. Why am I being accused? Tatiana, can you leave us? Stay there, Tatiana. How am I going to help Adrien? I helped you. I gave you fair warning. You still got away with things. I've just been too nice! - Bruno, don't get upset. - No, enough! Don't yell at ME! - Go away! - Let me talk to you I don't want to see you again... Get out! It's me. You alright? - You OK? - Yeah. Have you seen the kitchen? No. It's spotless. Thank you. Can I make you a coffee? No, I'm in a rush. I got work as an assistant for a caterer on the barge. They take me on trial in the kitchen. That's great! Wallet, phone... You just have to give me some time. Impossible, we already talked about it. I want to speak to the manager. He is not here and he'll say the same thing. I shall get the 2,000 euros! Trust me, please. - My son has to be here. - It's not possible. I have 20 names waiting. Don't get upset. I want to talk to the manager. You're not helping. Don't take it like that... Stop, stop! - Give me a break! - Call Stephane. Mrs Kriegel, that's quite enough! What are you doing? Call Stefan! Go and find him! Mrs Kriegel! Hi, Martin. Marie? How are you? Having fun with the blacks? Do you do it without a condom? What are you doing here? With the 30 you give them, they pay for their pimp. Did you know that? I can't see why you use these girls. You have money. Because of guys like you, I'm in deep shit. I don't care. Leave me alone. - Hold on... - Did you follow me? - Did you follow me here? - Yeah, listen... I'm asking you for 2,000 euros. You'll withdraw 2,000 euros and give them to me. Alright? I have photos of you with girls. - Shall I send them to your wife? - Are you crazy, Marie? What's all this garbage about? Don't talk... We'll go to the bank... You'll give me 2,000 euros. It's no big deal to you.. I'll give them back. Have you come here to blackmail me? How long have we known each other? 8 years! 8 years and you do this to me... You bitch! Don't say that... This is for my son! I don't give a damn about your son. You're a bitch, you hear? A bitch! 8 years, coming every week, and you do this to me?! Stop! Stop, stop! Bastard! You dirty bastard! Let me go, you piece of shit! Be quiet! Shut the fuck up! Let go of me! Let go of me! Mum? What's wrong? I failed. Failed at what? Failed at what, Mum? Perrandier. I don't have the money. Citrus creme brulee. Compliments of the chef. Thank you. Not eating? Yes. Delicious. Obviously. I added candied lemon. Yes... The army's really pissed off that I didn't join up. Not me. It's great in the kitchen here. - Really? - Yeah. The boss is happy. Got to get back. Wait. Congratulations. Come and dance... This is your song. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
