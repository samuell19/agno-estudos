Myra. - Oh my God, oh, Frenando, I've waited. I've waited so long. - So have I, so have I. (soft guitar music) And yet, I am so tired, I am so tired. - Where have you been? What have you been doing? - I can't stay. I have to go and-- - I know, you and me. It's all that counts. You're all I have that means anything. - Mexico, got to get to Mexico. - Why? - Have to. Can't stop now. - Kiss me, Frenando - I can tell. You will come to me. - I'll come anywhere you are, I love you. - Me too, I love you. - Speak in Spanish. (Frenando speaking in foreign language) (door opening) (hits booming) (men grunting) Take care. - You whore, just like your mother. Your own mother, like your mother, your mother. Like your mother. Just like you mother, like your mother. (gun firing) (suspenseful guitar music) (bell chiming) (soft guitar music) (men speaking in foreign language) - The room hasn't been occupied for quite a spell, Marshal. Ain't exactly a town to visit. Sheets are clean. Ain't no bugs or nothing. - Oh, well, that's comforting. You kind of low, Marshal? - You know a woman named Myra Polsen? - Myra Polsen? - Yeah, that's her name. - I sure do, Marshal. Fact is that everybody in town knows who Myra Polsen is. - Oh, Rosa, it's beautiful. - I finished it last night. - It's pretty enough to be a wedding dress. - Yeah, no one get married, only buried. - (speaks in foreign language) You can relax, I didn't come for a fitting. I was told I could find Myra Polsen here. - I'm Myra Polsen. - My name's Ross, US Marshal. - Myra is a good girl. She does nothing wrong. (Rosa speaking in foreign language) - Easy, ma'am. I just came to make conversation, in private. - In there. (Marshal speaking in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) I have a living to make. - Well, don't worry I won't linger that long. - And I am right outside, if I hear you do anything wrong to Myra. - Si. She worries over you like a mother. - Rosa's all the mother I have. - Your father? - He's dead. What do you want, Marshal? - A couple answers to a couple questions. - What about? - Frenando Nunez, to start with. - What about Frenando? - It's my question, Ms. Polsen, you tell me. Have you seen him? - Not for a long time. Why? Is Frenando in some kind of trouble? - Well, if you could call being wanted for questioning about a bank robbery trouble, yes, I'd say the boy is in trouble. - Well, I haven't seen him. - Well, you just said that Ms. Polsen. - Well, it's the truth. - Did he say where he was going? - Why would he tell me where he was going? He was just a worker around here. It was a ranch hand. He slept out in the barn. He was... - He was what, Myra? - Well, he was mine. Robbing a bank and running away doesn't make me love him any the less. - Look, I, I didn't come here to pry into your personal life. - You don't have to, Marshal, I'll tell you. My daddy found me in bed with Frenando. He wanted to kill him if he could, but Frenando knocked him down and took off. And then my daddy turned on me like a wild animal. He beat me and he called me a whore. You want to know what he did then, Marshal? My fine, righteous, every Sunday going to church daddy, well, he put a gun to his head, and he killed himself, because he knew that I loved Fernando. - Would you still give yourself to a man if you knew that he was a murderer as well as a thief? - What do you mean? - One of the bank guards was killed. Where was Frenando? - I told you, I don't know. And anyway it could not have been him. - Look, it's my job to bring him back, so he gets a chance to prove his innocence. I'll be over at the hotel in case you remember anything. Now the quicker I bring him back, the easier it'll be, and the quicker this whole thing will be over. You think about that. Well, nice place you have here, Senorita. - Senora, my husband, he is dead. - Well, I'm sorry, Senora. I'll, um, pass the word. - Marshal Ross? - Who are you? - My name is Brown, your door was open. I figured you wouldn't mind if I waited in here. - And why would you be waiting for me? - I'm looking for Frenando Nunez, $120,000. - Well, that's quite a coincidence, so am I. - (Laughs) No coincidence. - And you expect to find him and all that money in my room, huh? - I want all the information you've got on Nunez. - You do. Do you mind giving me one good reason why? - Well, I'm on the case, Marshal. That's the reason why. - Well, now, makes me feel very important, having a Pinkerton man break into my room and ask me questions. - Look, the way we got it figured there were three men in on the robbery, Nunez, a man we can't seem to trace, named Kruger, and a third man we shot and killed. - So I heard. - Yeah, he didn't think he was gonna die, but he was able to confess before he did. - You, uh, you shoot him, Mr. Brown? - Marshal, whatever gave you that idea? - I don't know. I thought I detected a hint of pride in your voice. - The way I see, it's one down, two more to look forward to. - You seem pretty good at arithmetic, too. You like, uh, gunning men down? - I just do my job the way I see it, Marshal. If I'm forced to defend myself, that's all. - Makes the trip back a little lighter, hmm? - You got the idea. Now how about filling me in on the information you've got? - Well, I think you know just about as much as I do. - Marshal, we're working on the same side of the law. Now just because we start from opposite ends doesn't mean we shouldn't cooperate. - Well, it's not a lack of cooperation. I have my end to do. You have yours. It's just that I do mine my way. - Did you talk to the girl? - I don't think she knows anything. Maybe where he's heading. - I'd say Mexico. - Well, that's what you say. - Well, then, let's move. We've got a lot of riding to do. - I don't think you heard me right, Mr. Brown. (door knocking) - Come in. - I want to talk to you. - You are Myra Polsen. - This is Mr. Brown, Pinkerton man, private detective. You can leave, now, Mr. Brown. This young lady and I have something to talk over. - Well, I want to hear what she's got to say. Well, where is he? Take off for Mexico? Come on, don't give me that wide-eyed stare of innocence. - The door is open, Mr. Brown. - You seem to be forgetting something, Marshal. I'm out after $120,000 of bank depositor's money. All you got to worry about is gunning down a killer. - You said you'd bring Frenando back alive, that you wouldn't shoot him. - I'll bring him back for the trial alive. That's a promise. - But he's not a killer. He's just not that kind of man. - Maybe you only know one side of him, girlie. When we're out there looking down the wrong end of that man's loaded gun, well, you can be sure it ain't for love. - Get out. - Can't say I blame you, Marshal. - Get out of here. - Call me when you're through. - You listen to me, Myra. I haven't got much time, because I got to be moving. I'm not going after that boy to kill him, but if he tries first, I got no choice. - I just pray to God he gets away. - It's your prayers against me, because he is not going to get away. I'll find him. (air whooshing) - Our boy? - Ashes smell strong. Maybe a day old. - All I can smell is that money up front, almost as good as the smell of fresh-fried bacon and hot black coffee. - More coffee, Mr. Brown, help keep you awake for the ride tonight? - No. How far ahead do you suppose he is? - Well, every mile he loses some. I'd say he's less than a day away. - Think he knows we're behind him? - Doesn't make any difference, not anymore. We'll get him. - What if that Mex is enjoying himself tonight, thinking of all that money he's going to spend if he lives that long? - You don't give up, do you? - Have you ever been attacked by a wounded animal, Marshal? - The boy isn't wounded, yet. - That's right he can move around. And he's desperate, that makes him really dangerous. Now a wounded animal is a lot easier to handle. It's easier to track, easier to bring down. I believe in playing the percentages, Marshal, that's all. 'Course if he couldn't move at all, he wouldn't even have to do that. - Do you like girls, Mr. Brown? - Well, what do you, what do you mean? - Well, the way you talk about hunting down Nunez, talk, talk about every man you hunt down that way? - What way? - Well, you know, the way some men talk about the women they've had. You strike me that way about this boy. - You are getting to be a real Mex lover, aren't ya? - I'd sure as hell hate to have a different color skin than yours, Mr. Brown. (horse neighing) (gun firing) - God damn fool. - I don't take any chances. - You pull that trigger one more time, and Pinkerton's gonna have one very dead agent. Walk with your hands up. - You must be crazy. - I had to come. I was afraid. I thought if I was with you, I might be able to tell Frenando into giving himself up. - Now I've heard everything. - It's true. - What's your plan? We take you to him? You join him against us? Wind up together in Mexico with everything, him and the money, huh? - I don't care about the money. I want him, and I'll do anything to keep him alive, anything. - Well, now, we might just have to be putting you to the test on that, huh, Marshall? - Shut up, Brown. - You're losing your politeness. Until now, you called me Mr. Brown. Come to think of it, it's a good idea her showing up. We get him boxed in and use her to coax him out. A wounded animal is a lot easier to handle, remember Marshal? - Get your horse. - What kind of a man is that? - He's that kind of a man. I hope you know how much you're complicating my job. - I can help. I promise I won't be any trouble. - You are not in a position to promise anything. What do you mean? - Well, look around you. You might as well be flat in the middle of hell. Now the only thing you've got, if something should happen to you or your horse breaks a leg, is me. Now are you gonna promise me that can't happen? No. You'd better get on back while it's still possible, because if anything should happen to you, I am not stopping. Now do you know what that means? - Yes. - I can't stop. I can't let anything hold me up. Now, is that clear? - I still want to go with you. ♪ I'm searching for something ♪ ♪ You look tonight ♪ ♪ So let the moon come up ♪ ♪ The night wind stride, and cross the world ♪ ♪ To touch the sky as you clutch the party ♪ ♪ To your side and close your eyes ♪ ♪ Live life of lonely, like I'm lonely ♪ - He's a lucky man having a girl like you.

What's wrong? - Come over here. There's a dead horse in the ravine. All right, let's get down there. Come on, we'll go this way. (Myra screaming) I didn't say you had to come along. - I want to see if it's his. It's his. - Looks like that ridge gave way up there. He probably couldn't see this ravine in the dark. Lucky he got clear of the horse before he went down. There's broken legs, a bullet through the head. - And that's how they found the bank guard, bullet through the head. Looks like the Mex has gone bone dry. Isn't that too bad? All that money to spend and no place to go. Well, we'll be generous. We'll put a dollar on his grave when we bury him. (thunder rumbling) - We'll pack in here. Get a fresh move in the morning. - Well, why wait? He's up in those mountains somewhere. - I like to see where I'm going, gives me a feeling of security. - You wait for the daylight, Marshal. I like the night, and what he can't see won't hurt him. - All right, hold it, Brown. - Marshal! - What I can see can hurt you. Now, you want to make this a contest? - Well, what contest, Mr. Ross, against a law-abiding peace officer like yourself? - Well, I'm glad to see you remember that. - Marshal, take his gun. - He's broken no law, Ms. Polsen. What he may be thinking is one thing, but you can't take away a man's gun for thinking thoughts, no matter what. - That's mighty white of you, Mr. Marshal. Innocent until proved guilty, I like that. - Just remember, it doesn't buy you any special privileges. Now settle down, both of you. (thunder rumbling) - It's only me. - I didn't hear you. - Well, that comes from years of having (murmurs). You don't trust me, do you? - Something about you frightens me. - I'm just a simple man in a complicated world, is all. - And you like to kill. - It depends. - Frenando doesn't want to kill you. - Now, you really are worried about my going to kill him, aren't ya? - I've seen, I've seen the look you get on your face. - Yeah, well now, maybe you can change that. Maybe you can help me to make up my mind about my feelings? - I don't understand. - Well, you were just saying about seeing that look on my face when you think I'm thinking about killing him. I mean, your, your man. Actually, I'm as harmless as a mouse, but I'm practical, realistic. That's the way everybody should be, don't you think, realistic? I mean, for example, what would you say his life is worth? - Anything. - That's what I thought you'd say. His life for your anything. Well, you just pretend that I'm him for as long as it takes. I'll be here waiting. - Coffee's ready. - No, thank you. - Mr. Brown having words with you? Making you promises, I take it. - How did you know? - Oh, a man like me, living the life I've lived, seeing the things I've seen, just another sense in me to know these things, especially with all the Browns I've come across in this world. - That's what he said. Only he said it differently. - Yes, I imagine he would, being who he is. So he made you a proposition, your boy's life for your boy's girl. Nice, clean, upright citizen, Mr. Brown. And what did you tell him? - That I love Fernando. - Must have touched him. - He can't be killed. - And I can't promise you that he won't be. Ms. Polsen, you smell very sweet and strong out here, but don't bargain with me. I'm not Mr. Brown. I aim to keep my promise, if it's in my power. - Will you talk to him? - I'm afraid Mr. Brown and I don't speak the same language. I can't change his sickness. (thunder rumbling) - He's never hurt you. He doesn't even know you. - He'll know me tomorrow. - Marshal will stop you. - Marshal won't stop anybody, because it'll be in self defense. And you can bet my life on that. (thunder rumbling) (Myra screaming) - Stop, please, stop. (screams) Oh, god, (murmurs). (weapon firing) - Stay down, hold your fire, Brown. Nunez, Nunez, give up! Stay down here for as long as he holds out. - Frenando! - Myra, get back here. - Frenando, Frenando, it's me, Myra. - [Frenando] Or I'll blow your damn head off. - I didn't tell them anything. I followed them, I had to come. - Who would believe that? - It's true, Nunez. - Please, I don't want you killed. - [Frenando] Looks to me from where I sit, I'll do the killing. - No, you've got to give yourself up. It's the only chance. I want to see you, talk to you. Frenando! - [Frenando] Who's that with you? - It's the Marshal and a Pinkerton man. - You brought water? - [Frenando] All right, come up. - Oh, no. - Hold it. - You're not gonna let her take him that water. - Let her go. (weapon firing) All right, go ahead. Just pull that trigger. - Are you crazy? - I'll take your gun. (screams) - Give me your gun, Brown! Now, when one or both of them get back, I'll give you your gun. Besides, when she hands him that canteen, we'll know where he is. - Frenando, which way? - [Frenando] Keep coming, to your right. - I can't see you. - [Frenando] Come to your right, about 10 feet. - Where are you? - [Frenando] Just come ahead. - But where? - Here. (weapon firing) - Oh, Frenando! Frenando. He promised he wouldn't. He promised. - Help me up. - It was going to be so beautiful. I was waiting until dark, (murmurs), pick them up, take the horses. I let you ruin it. - They told me a bank guard was shot and killed. Did you do it? - No, (murmurs). (murmurs) Is waiting for me in Mexico. - All right, where did you get it? Where? - I got what, Marshal, I thought you fired the shot. (hit booming) (weapon firing) - You hear me down there, amigos? Move one inch, and I blow your damn heads off. - Nunez? - Which one are you? - Ross, United States Marshal. - So relax, amigo. You are not going anywhere. - Don't be a damn fool. You can't last any time with that little water. - You watch me. - What about the girl? You gonna keep her prisoner? - Prisoner? She's got my other gun on you! - Oh, you are bleeding bad. Let me try to stop it. - Have to wait. I don't have the strength to get out of here tonight. (Frenando groaning) - I don't know enough what to do. Let me call up the Marshal. - You're crazy. - Please, let me call him. - Sure, so they can watch me die. What's the difference? - Here, have some water. - Save it. We'll need it tomorrow. - Then at least get some sleep. - Can't. - Two against one, you give me back my gun; we go up and take 'em. - All right. You lead the way. You can take the first shot in your guts. - We just gonna stay here and wait, huh? - Well, he's not going anywhere, and we're not going anywhere. - Even though she's helping him, he must be hurt pretty bad. - Thanks to me. - Yeah, you must feel very proud of yourself. - Frenando, Frenando, wake up. Frenando, wake up, please. Marshal! Marshal! - Yeah? - You've got to come up here. Frenando is shot up bad. He's awful sick. - Where's his guns? - He won't try anything. He's unconscious. - Look, if you want us to come up there, you gotta throw his guns over the ledge. Relax, Brown. Where's the other gun? - He hasn't got another gun. Believe me. - Myra, we're coming up. - We? - I've reached a point in my life where exposing the back of my head to a fellow like you could make me nervous. - You learn fast, Marshal. - Uh-huh. After you, Mr. Brown. Just the hat, Mr. Brown. - Frenando. - Cold, I am cold. - It's going to be all right. Marshal is on his way up, now. There's blankets down below. I'll help you. I'll do anything. Please don't die. Please don't die. Marshal? - Well, if that ain't a sight to make a grown man cry. - You, you shot him. You rotten, filthy, liar! - Well, it didn't help, did it? - Better him than one of us. - Now, Mr. Brown, you can leave that right where it is. - This is my business. - After I've finished counting it, I'll think about what's your business. Now put it back. - Why, sure, Marshal. - Why, thank you. - He's lost a lot of blood. - He's been having fever and chills. - I'm gonna have a hell of a time getting him off this mountain in the dark. We'll stay here 'til morning. (Frenando coughing) - Well, he's not dead yet. Marshal, you gonna let her keep that gun? - Why, are you nervous about something, Mr. Brown? - You give her a gun. You know damn well she'd like to kill me. - I wouldn't shoot you, Mr. Brown. I promise I wouldn't shoot ya. We can make it a promise. You understand all about promises, now, don't you, Mr. Brown? - Wait a minute, Myra. - Well, are you gonna sit there? Do something, she's gonna kill me. - I promise I won't shoot ya. I promise I won't kill you, Mr. Brown. (gun clicking) - All right, you can stop running, Mr. Brown. You're a very lucky man. How'd it feel, killer? You have anything clean we can use for bandages? That's pretty fancy bandages. Tear 'em into strips. Brown, get that hot water over here. All right, hold this shoulders down. - I'm not gonna help him. - You want to get out of here alive? - Be a lot simpler, lot quicker, if you just let him die. We'll bury him. - Hold him down. (Frenando screaming) Press down harder. - It's gonna be all right. Frenando, it will be all right. (Frenando murmuring) - Now, hold him, Brown. (hit booming) Souvenir, Mr. Brown? You might want to show it to your grandchildren one day. - You think he's gonna be all right? - Who's God? We wait and see. - For how long? How long do you think the water is gonna last? - Then you take your ration and leave, Mr. Brown. - You think I won't? - I wish you would. - All right. - You go alone, Mr. Brown. The money goes back with me. - I don't let anybody do my job, Marshal. - Then you'll just have to wait. - Now look, I've got what I came for. Now why should I wait around for him to get well, because he's gonna die anyway, one way or the other. - I am getting sick and tired of both of you. Now, you made your deal with him and it didn't work. He shot Nunez anyway, but you will not settle your revenge on my time. And you, Brown, you stay away from him and her, because if you don't, so help me, I'll dump the whole lot of you right here, and you'll just rot. You take care of him, and I'll take care of the law. Go easy on that. - It's my ration, Marshal. - Maybe, but you'll not make it out of here if you keep giving him yours. - I'll make it. - Marshal. (Marshal grunting) - The water. - I didn't know it was there. I was just, uh-- - You just wanted? Just wanted to run off with all the money? You should know better than to try that, Kreuger. - What? - We could've made it just fine, if you hadn't got greedy, Kreuger. - Kreuger? This Mex is out of his mind. - He knows. - You're delirious, ya-- - Come on, amigo. No point in trying to hide now. - He shot the banker. - Ask him. Let him tell you. - Look, I got credentials. You saw them. - Oh, have you got credentials? How were they, Marshal? Looked pretty good to you, huh? Just like the real thing. - You're not gonna believe him? - Kreuger, It's me, Frenando. I know you like my own brother, God forbid. - I'll shut your mouth for good, you little Mex-- - Why are you getting so exited if it isn't true? (Frenando murmuring) - What's the point? - You telling me he was in the robbery with you? - Up to his eyeballs, him, me, and myself. - You damn liar. - Maybe, maybe not. - Well what's that supposed to mean? - You've been boiling over to kill-- - Marshal, he knows how Kreuger does his job. - Yeah, you just better be very careful what you believe, because when we get back, I'll dig a hole so deep, you'll never get out of it. - Well, you go on and do that, Mr. Brown, 'cause the most that can happen to me is I lose my badge. And seeing as how this is my last job anyway, you find the biggest hole you can. And seeing as how you just tried to put a knife in me, I'm treating you the same as him. If it's Brown or Krueger, it makes no difference to me. - We go. We go together, amigo. - You-- (Brown grunting) - Dammit, Brown, shut up. Myra, get the rope. - Rope? - Well, look. - Shut up. - How do you like that, Kreuger? - All right, now you, Nunez. - My pleasure, senor. Well, tonight I would say no need for your gun, but tomorrow, now that might be another story. - I'll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. - Oh, you will be very sleepy (speaks in foreign language). - Well, don't you lose any sleep over it, huh? - No, Marshal, I won't. I will sleep like a baby. Marshal, you saved my life, (speaks in foreign language). - That just makes us even, so don't thank me.

And I'm not sure about this horse carrying double. I don't need no favors, Marshal. - I'm not thinking of you. - We just got to get back, Frenando. We've just got to. - We will. - All right, hold it. We rest here. - How are they holding up? - Well, if they start dropping like Brown's horse, we're in trouble. Gonna be them or us for the water. - Think we're gonna make it? - I'd like to think so. - You ought to try to get some sleep, Marshal, you're beginning to look awfully tired. - Look, I'll make a deal with you. You don't give me any sympathy; I don't give you any. - It wasn't sympathy. We need you. - Look, we are stuck with each other, if you call that a need. Now I didn't want you along when you first showed up. I wanted you even less after that night between you and Brown. - What night between him and her, Marshal? What about you and him? I ask you! - I... - So, what's going on, amigo? - Not my place to say. - You opened your mouth. Finish it. - Look, I don't mean to interrupt. I don't care what you say. I gotta have water for that horse. - Sorry. - He's not gonna hold up. - He'll have to. - I gotta have water for that horse! - You want water for your horse, give him yours! - What was said about you and him? Myra? - It's just something happened. - What? - Frenando, at this point we're just trying to stay alive long enough to, can't we talk about this when we get back? - I don't know. - Trust me. You've just got to trust me. You shouldn't have said what you did in front of Frenando. - I know sometimes a man gets weary. He gets frustrated, angry, his tongue slips and he says things he shouldn't say. - Wasn't how you think, Marshal. Sure, maybe I would've done anything to keep that man from killing Frenando, and deep down inside I knew that, well, that he was a liar and that he wanted to shoot him. But the truth is, I never had the chance to hate myself. He raped me. Now you can believe that or not, but I can't be hurt anymore. - Broken leg. (gun firing) (horse neighing) (soft blues music) - What's the matter? - I don't know. It's just so-- - Something bothering you, especially? - It's so hot and dry, and dusty. I'd just give anything if I could feel clean. Why are you looking at me like that? It's funny, you talking the way you have. I don't think I ever seen you looking more soft and pretty. It makes me think of everything we might have had. And maybe this is the last time we'll ever have together. Myra-- - I can't. - Myra, this may never be again. - Please, Frenando. - I don't understand. You never did this before. - It's different now. I'm different now. - This is me, Frenando. I am not different. Why do you say you are different? - Because. - Why? - Don't ask me that, Frenando. - Why, Myra? - Because you wouldn't understand. - You are telling me what I won't understand? - He said he wouldn't kill you. He promised me. - Who promised? - I couldn't stop him. I tried, but I couldn't help myself. I couldn't stop him. - Him? - I did nothing. - Him? - I told you, I did nothing. He forced me! - You (speaks in foreign language). - No. - Kreuger! Kreuger! - Frenando, don't. - Come here, Kreuger. - I don't answer to that name. - Just come over here. - Well? - How was she, Kreuger? - Oh, God. - How was she, what, Nunez? - How was she? - I've had better. - You heard that, Myra. He's had better. - Stop it, all of you! You're dirt, just dirt, that's all. I used to love you, but, but you don't even know what that means! Well, I'm not gonna have anybody thinking that I'm just like some dirty little alley cat. You're going to marry me, right now, right here. The Marshal can do it. - Come on, Myra. - You said you'd fend for me when you got to Mexico. You said we'd get married. - That was then. - That doesn't change anything. I'm not gonna live this way another day. I'm not gonna have anybody looking at me like I was just something not even human. - How human were you when you gave yourself to him? - Frenando! I've got your baby in me. - It will be all right, Myra. Myra, Myra? - Might as well face it, she's gone. - It's time for the wedding, Myra. - A wedding. - Your wedding to Fernando. - Not me. Not to her. - What makes you so special, hmm? Is she the only woman you ever had? And if you didn't kill that bank guard, how many men did you kill that the law doesn't even know about? - A man does marry only once in his life. He doesn't pick (speaks in foreign language). (men grunting) - You were not worth saving, Nunez. But you're gonna give her that. It's all she has left. - So, what's the difference? - Are you ready for the wedding now, Myra? - Oh, yes. - After the ceremony, I'll write it up all legal and proper. And you can show it to anybody that wants to know, that you're Mrs. Frenando Nunez. - Mrs. Frenando Nunez. Um, I'm not dressed proper. - Doesn't matter. - But I brought a dress that was made special for it. (soft blues music) - Jeez. (soft blues music) - Frenando. All right, over here. You're best man. While I've buried 'em, and I've christened 'em, first time I've ever married 'em. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here, in the sight of God, to join together this man and this woman in the state of holy matrimony. Now if there's anyone here who objects to this matrimony, let him now speak up or forever hold his peace. Now, do you, Myra Polsen, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband? - I do. - Do you, Frenando Nunez, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife. - I do. - I now pronounce you man and wife. - What horse do I ride on? - You ride with him. - I'd rather crawl, first. - Suit yourself. - Myra? Myra, this piece of paper says you're married. Time to go now, Myra. (gun firing) - The horse can't carry both of you. You'll have to walk. - Now even if you have the strength to steal that horse, he doesn't have strength enough to carry you. Brown, Brown, do you remember what happened to your horse when he ran out of water? - What? What got into you, Marshal? - I'm asking him a question. - Yeah, I remember what happened to the horse when it ran out of water. - Same thing happens to people, only it takes longer, so hot your skin begins to feel like leather. Men get so dried out, you can't even, you can't even, sweat! Well, where is it? - That's my, my water. That's my water. That's my water. - [Marshal] That's enough. (gun firing) (Brown yelling) - I wasn't gonna hit him. Honestly, I wasn't. I was just joking. I was just pretending. That's all I was doing. (cries) I was just pretending. - Empty. - But how can you do that? - Easy. - You see, he, ah. - Too bad, Kreuger. You will never pull a trigger with that hand again. - You forget I can prove my identity. - Maybe. But I will die saying you are Kreuger, and I will die happy. If you die saying you are Brown, so you will die happy. It all depends who, between us, dies first. I walk with you, Myra. - So you're not believing I'm who Nunez says I am. - It's not for me to stay. - But I'm not. - Then you got nothing to worry about. - Yeah, you're half believing it, aren't ya? Because even if I wasn't Kreuger, you really want to believe it. - Nunez, you tell him, damn it. Tell him. - Tell him what? - You tell him! - About how you shot the bank guard, Kreuger? (ominous orchestral music) (Frenando gasping) - Kreuger. - What do you want? - I want a dollar. I want a dollar. (laughs) - Nunez, there's a dollar for your grave, from Kreuger. You already got what Brown wanted for ya.
