No wait, it's my fault. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Don't push your luck, pal. - Let him go, it's okay. Let him go. He's a friend of mine, with me. I know a nice, quiet bar five minutes from here. ♫ When it all falls around us ♫ When it's taken just too much - [Bouncer] All right, out you go. ♫ When we've tried to get higher - Oh, my car's right over there.

Ah, I think it's such a romantic language. Well, it's nice to meet you. What's T stand for? - Shit. - [Leonie] What do they want? - [Joe] Don't let 'em see you. - Well, why are they following you? - Parking tickets. I'll make you a deal. If they stop, I'll stop. Till then, you're stuck with me. - Well, it could be worse. I could still be stuck with Jenny and Marie. - I'm bored with this. (tires screeching) (sirens blaring) - Parking tickets? (engine roars) (mysterious music) Wanna come upstairs? - Well, I have a few friends I have to go and meet. (giggling) - I have a few friends I'd like you to meet. (alarm ringing) (soothing music) - Bene. - Are you sure that's the right color? No, show it to me again, dear. - All right, Mrs. Karvan. See? It's the same. - I'm still not sure. Leonie knows me better what I want. I don't see why she couldn't be here. - She'll be in later. - Hello, Mrs. Karvan, how are you today? - Oh hello. - Mrs. Karvan was a little worried about the color of her hair. - Oh, not to worry. We'll get the color just perfect. You'll be beautiful. - Thank you. - Well, how was he? - Different. (ominous music) Bye, Sharon. - Could you do Mrs. Morris tomorrow? Just a rinse at nine. - Fancy her, do you? - Does she speak Italian? - No. - Then I don't. - Well aren't you Sir Galahad. Thank you, Joe T. - Not yet. - Oh it's beautiful. It must've cost you a fortune. - It's a goodbye present from me to you. Didn't seem to be much happening for me anywhere else. So I'm heading north to join my brother Jack. - Jack. So that's who the name belongs to. - What? - Well, it was on the dashboard of your car. - You don't miss much, do you? - Eh, I wouldn't say that. Well did you know that I've won several hairdressing awards? I still can't get a raise. I'm sorry. I go on a bit, don't I? Well, tell me about you. - There's not much to tell. I'm in the motor trade and I'm going to Springvale to go into business. - [Leonie] With Jack. - Good evening. This evening's specials are pumpkin soup, hot bread roles, and baked leg of lamb. I'll come back later. - Hey, Joe, do you think we could see each other, I mean? - Sure. I'm not leaving till tomorrow. - No, I mean after that. - You can come visit anytime. I'd like that. - Thanks. Champagne, that's what we need. Bring us the best you got to celebrate. - [Waiter] Certainly. - Don't look at me, she's paying. - Well, here's the registration and the keys. Thank you. - Thank you. - Take good care of it. (pleasant music) - Jack would love that car. - It's too late now. It's only a car. - I better look after this. Just till we hit Springvale. Don't wanna lose it, do we? - What kind of business did you say you were in? - Cars. Look, you want your own business, right? Let me look after the financials and I'll help you. Trust me. Okay, keep it. - No, you keep it. (giggling) (doors slamming) - If the cops come up ask me about who owns the car, you tell 'em you don't know, okay? - What car? - They're downstairs. - Oh, okay. - [Policeman] They must be in one of 'em. (knocking) No one's ever home when you need 'em. - [Policeman] Well, let's try this one. (loud knocking) Let's report the Valiant outside. - [Policeman] Yeah, okay. - You sure go to a lot of trouble for parking tickets. - Nosy bastards. Dropkicks. Why can't they go after the real crims? Always after the bad boys. How soon can you be packed? - Half an hour? - I'll be back. - Look, you're not in any kind of real trouble, are you? Because if you are-- - See you in half an hour. (horn honking) Come on. (horn honking) Is that it? - No, just two more. Little baby. (giggling) - Chop chop. - [Leonie] So what's Springvale like? Is it pretty? Are there palm trees? - [Joe] Yep. (giggling) - [Leonie] Joe, are you in trouble? You know with the police coming around and all that. - [Joe] No, it's the car, that's all. - [Leonie] Is it stolen? - Jack gave it to me before he left for Springvale. Bastard. (chuckles) It probably is. (peaceful music) You go in, I'm gonna go over to the beach for awhile. - Oh, wouldn't you like something nice and cold to drink after all that hard work? - Sure. See you in half an hour. (giggling) - Smile, you're on Randy cam. - Get my best side. - You watching us? - Well who wouldn't? There must be a line I could use here. - I think you just used it. - Just enjoying the surf? Your boyfriend's good. - That's my brother, Shane. - Looks like he can handle it. - Came first in the scholastics last year and third at Surfer Bash. - Shane who? - Boon. Hey, why are you so curious anyway? - I might be interested in sponsoring him. - Don't say it. Do you know Joey Carroll? - Yes. Do you live around here? I'm Troy. - Are you for real? - Okay, forget it. - No, let's talk about it. Shane, that is. - Sure, what about 8:00 tonight? - Talk about Shane, right? - And you. Only let's keep it between ourselves. Surprise him. - Surprise him. - Gotta go. Got some business to attend to. - Hey, don't you wanna meet him? - Sure, we'll talk until later, okay? Here. - Here, 8:00. Bye, Troy. (giggling) - What's up? - I thought maybe you'd like some company but I see you already found some. - Hey, don't get smart. - I see you like them young. - Leave it alone. - [Patron] I love the felted jacket, dickhead. - Don't open a can of worms you can't eat. (soothing music) - Hi. Sorry I'm late. But dad was giving me a hard time. - You didn't tell him anything, I hope. - You look good in clothes. I mean (laughing) it's a really neat jacket. (giggling) Can we go somewhere? (giggling) (thunder cracks) (keys rattling) (rock music) - Do you wanna talk about it? - What? - I'm sorry about today. Look, I don't wanna fight. I want us to work out. I know I don't really know you, but I know I wanna be with you. I could be good for you. I could help you. - Well, help us out of this, then, for a start. Shit. - Did you go looking for that girl? Did you find her? Was she good? Better than me? (pleasured moans) (panting) (ominous music) (phones ringing) - The detectives will see you now, Mr. Boon. - Come, Mr. Boon. Come on. Detective Sergeant Chenko. - How do you do? Take a seat, Mr. Boon. Coffee? This is a shocking case, Mr. Boon. Now, we're gonna have to ask you a few questions that may offend you, but we need to know who Bree was with and what boys she was seeing. - We need this information to locate her killer. And believe me, Mr. Boon, we will. Now let's start with where she was that night and who she was with. You do know who her friends were, Mr. Boon? - She was a good, little girl. - I have a daughter, Mr. Boon, I understand how you feel. Did Bree go straight home from school or did she stop off somewhere first? - She... She went to the beach. - Did she go there with anyone? - Her brother, Shane. Shane rides a surfboard. Bree... Bree used to watch him from the beach. - You're doing fine, Mr. Boon. (weeping) - Come on, Mr. Boon. We'll continue some other time, come on. How the hell could a guy like that know what his daughter's up to? (peaceful music) (giggling) - Thanks. That's just the way I like it with the tobacco sticking out like that. (laughing) (romantic adventure music) - Wow. So you want a sandwich, right? - Yeah, anything. I'm just gonna make a phone call, okay? (ominous music) Thanks. - This reminds me of a place my parents used to bring me on vacation when I was a little girl. Brings back some nice memories. How about you? - No, never knew my mother. My old man was always down the mines. Mostly it was just me and Jack. We made our own holidays. - [Girl] Sorry. - Just looking. (funeral music) (angelic singing) (weeping) - Are you gonna be all right? - I'm sorry, Mr. Boon. If it's of any comfort to you, we do have a suspect. I will need your help to identify him. So I'll call you later. Will your mother be all right? Look after your father, he needs you. (waves crashing) - [Leonie] Milk too, right? - [Joe] Yeah. - [Leonie] Oh I'm sorry, I forgot the milk. - [Joe] I can get it. - [Leonie] You're sure? - [Joe] No problem. - [TV Announcer] Another two points. The pressure's going up-field. Pops a pass. (window screeching) - [Neighbor] Hey you. He's trying to break in. Grab him. - [Bystander] You're not getting away that easy. (dogs barking) (baby crying) - Right. If you see or hear anything suspicious, don't interfere. And please, don't try to apprehend anyone. Is that clear? Call me at the station. Now I suggest you all go back to your vans. And goodnight. - Good evening. - God you frightened me. Where have you been? - Getting the milk. - What'd you do, milk the cow? - Good-looking cow. - That was you back there, wasn't it? - Maybe. But no one got hurt. Now they have something to talk about over breakfast. - I don't know, Joe, sometimes you frighten me. (heavy breathing) (romantic music) (pleasured moans) I just can't get enough of you. (heavy breathing) - Mr. Boon, we need to know if you recognize the suspect so that we can hold him. Have you ever seen this man before? - No. Who is he? - John Geoffrey Harding. - We believe he was seeing Bree. - She was a good girl. She wasn't seeing this person or anyone else. She was a God-fearing child. - Dad. - It's okay, thank you, Mr. Boon. She was at the beach photographing you, wasn't she? - That's right. But there was no one else with her. - Come on. (dog barking) - John. (grunting) - No, Shane, I didn't do it. - Why are you trying to get away? Answer me. I could've identified you but I didn't. - The cops won't believe me. I wouldn't kill her. I can't breathe. - Well who did, then? Did you seen anyone else? - I can't breathe, I don't know. I wouldn't kill her for Christ's sake. I didn't. I didn't see her that night. She said she was busy. - Then prove it. - Her camera. Where's her camera? - If it was you... (wistful music) - How long had she been seeing this Harding boy? - I don't know. Really. - It's In her diary. She's been writing about him. You must've known. - She had lots of friends. What's wrong with that? - She was a God-loving child. - She's not a child. She wasn't a child. - You knew she was seeing him, didn't you? That she was seeing a man like your whore of a mother. - You drove mom away. The arguments and the fights. That's not why Bree died, can't you see? She was just a normal girl not some sort of saint. - She was carrying on behind my back. - So Bree had a boyfriend. Just a normal kid. How could you remember her as a slut? - Who is this man, then? Who else was she seeing? - I don't know. (romantic slow rock music) - This looks great. - Yeah. - I think I'm gonna like this place. Aren't we gonna stop? - Gotta check in first. Look out for the Skyline Drive-In. - All right. - There we are. Won't be long. (hammering) - Hey, Rocky, look what the cat dragged in. - Hey, it's about time. How you been? - Good, man. Nice set up. Where's Jack? - He's pissed off, you know. Bad news. - What's he done this time? - When you're not around to wet nurse, he does the wrong thing. He kept a BMW we had on order. - Is that all? - Amongst other things. - Okay, I'll square it away. What's he owe? - That's not the point. The Melbourne boys were waiting for the motor. - A bit late. - Why, where is he? - Don't panic. He'll come back when he finds out you're in town. - [Rocky] Tell us what you've been up to. (speaking Italian) - What's up his ass? - Ah, he's in a bad mood. So, how long are you staying? - I just got here, man. Jack said you might have a bit of work for me. - Yeah. I tell you what, let's talk about it in the morning. 10:00 a.m. at the beach front. I've gotta go. - Rocky, where's Jack? - Don't know. Joe. - Yeah. We're settled. Lee? - Where are we going? - The Valiant in the photo, I checked with some hotels. It was last seen heading north. - Excellent. - The lady at the motel even got its number. But she couldn't tell me anymore about the people. - Hey, this is more like it. I bet the cops are impressed. - The police got their own justice. - I'll get changed. - No. I have to go alone. And Shane, I don't want you to tell anyone. - I wanna go. - You'll stay here and go on with your schooling. - Is that all you're interested in, my grades? I wanna find out who did this just like you. Bree was my sister. - Shane, you're a child. You've got college. You're staying here. - Well how about this one? It's great. It's already furnished and everything. What do you think? - It's a bit expensive, don't you think? - Once I have my business we can do it. Come on. - Okay. You do look rather nice. I'll be back later. (romantic music) These English numbers are easy. - Yeah. Hope you don't wanna claim it like Jack. - Lay off him, okay? - We've got about 10 seconds. - Let's go. Eight, seven. Six. How much longer? - We're done. Three, two. Close one, son. - So why'd Jack get me up here? It wasn't just for this, was it? You don't need me to help you shift a few cars. - No, he just wanted to do you a favor, that's all. - A favor, that's nice. Come on, Rocky, what'd he do besides keeping a hot car? - He upset the wrong people. (chuckles) - What'd he do, give 'em the clap or something? - Worse. He nicked Claw's lady. (laughing) - Is that all? He must've been desperate. - I said Claw's lady. You know the rules. - [Joe] When do I get to see him? - He said he'd be in touch. - You listen to me, I don't give a shit about Claw or his lady, I wanna talk to my brother. - I don't know where he is. - Don't lie to me. - We're gonna crash. (tires screeching) - Tell me. - Yes. - Yes what? - Yes I'll take you to him. (chuckles) It's like in the pits at Indy. I need some new plates bad. - No worries. (gears whirring) - Rocky, is this the color? - It's what they ordered. Gets a bit hot around here. Let's do a lunch. - I've got other things planned. - You better get out of here, if you know what I mean. Joe and I are off to pick up a couple of cars tomorrow. See you later. - Hey. Seen that brother of yours? - No. Where do you reckon he'd be? - Tweed, Lismore. He hasn't tried to contact you yet? - No. - He will. - Keep you posted. (shouting) (playful music) - [Girls] Woohoo. - Thanks. Didn't you like the view? - It's less windy here. - Oh yeah? - I thought maybe we could just talk for awhile. I mean, we haven't had any time to talk about our plans about us. Do you think maybe we could do something together tonight? Ray said there was a good restaurant down the road. - Ray? - The agent. - Not white shoes. (laughing) Yeah, sure. I've gotta go over to Rocky's later, but tonight's okay. - Has something been bothering you? - No. - Well, it just seems like you've been rather distant. Is it about your brother? Is everything okay? - It's just that I came up here to go into business with Jack. I don't know, the same old shit. - Listen, if it's financial don't worry about it. You can keep that money I lent you until you get back on your feet. - Thanks, but I'll be all right. - Tell me about your brother. - I haven't had a chance to see him yet. He's been busy. Maybe tomorrow. - Well, I mean is he dark, fair? - What's with all the questions? - I was just curious, that's all. And I still don't know that much about you and your family, about what you wanna do with your life. - Jack and me are gonna get a car yard. Valiants, Chevies, good stuff. None of the junk crap. - Joe, you know you and that girl at Manly? - That's what's been bothering you. - Joe-- - I knew you were gonna hassle. - Joe, she was murdered. Look, I love you. Just tell me you didn't do it and then I'll believe you. Tell me you didn't do it. Just say yes or no. - No. All right? - Yeah Springvale, mate. They went north. Most do. - Thank you, thanks again. - Hey give us another 10 bucks and I'll tell you where Paul Ivan is, Mr. Boon. - Please dear God help me. Kill the demons, Lord, kill them. (phone ringing) - [Answering Machine] Hi, this is the Boon household. No one's here right now. Leave a message after the tone and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. (tone rings) - [Anthony] Shane, well I hope everything's all right. I'm heading for Springvale. Sorry I had to leave in such a hurry. Remember, don't tell the police anything. I'll call you later. God bless. (horn honking) (pleasant piano music) (chattering) - Well, if it isn't Ms. Stevens. Are you still interested in that shop? - Leonie. And yes, if the rent is reasonable. - Nice pendant. Where's the man tonight? - Ray, you're wasting your time. I'm a married woman. Well, almost. - Hey, so am I. But when the cat's away. - Yes, I know, but not this kitty-cat. - A round please and this lady. - And for the lady? - Oh a gin squash please. - So tell me, Leonie, what did you do down south? - I'm a hairdresser. - Well that shop we've got will be just perfect for you. - I'm sorry, mate. You're shoeless. - You should come and see me tomorrow and we'll take a look over the place. - Okay. - I don't have shoes, you prick. Why don't you go and get the manager for me? - Rules are rules, sir. You can come back when you have a pair of shoes. (chuckles) (grunting) - Don't fuck with me. Have a good night, shithead. - Well, let's say we get a bottle of champers and forget what's happened, huh? A bottle and two ice glasses, please. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Goodnight, ma'am. (engine roars) (ominous music) - [Raspy Voice] Help me. (struggled breathing) (gasping) - What have you done, Joe? (screaming) - [Victim] Help me. (grunting) (gasping) - Oh god. Oh no. My pendant. Where's my pendant? My pendant's gone. (shrieking) (whimpering) - I want to be with you, darling. - Don't. - I want you, baby. I want you, baby. I want you. (ominous music) (horn honking) Let's go to work. (plotting music) - I wonder if her skull's crushed. - [Policeman] Bill, get these kids out of here. - [Bill] Come on. Get off to school. Off you go. Nothing to see. Come on. - Excuse me, has there been an accident? - And who are you? - A reporter for the wire services. - Uh-huh. We're not sure yet. Looks like she might've put up quite a struggle. They think she's fractured her skull. We're looking for a rock or something similar which might've caused it. - Any suspects? - Won't know until forensics's finished. - Thank you, thanks. Did you know the girl? - Yes, it's a small town. - What's her name? Was she pretty? - Yes. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. Well I'm heading back into town. Can I give you a ride? Come on, lock your eyes over here. - Thank you. - So where would you like to go? - Home, please. I'm sorry, up the hill. Well, you can just let me off over here. That'd be great. Listen, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thanks, bye-bye. - Excuse me. Kid's mom brought it in. Little bugger found it and was gonna keep it. - And why did the desk sergeant pass it onto us? - [Greaves] BB. - There's a guy who wants to reverse-charge a call from Springvale. - Chenko. - I found the killer of my daughter, Detective Chenko. - Mr. Boon. You must not-- - I have evidence. And he killed again, last night. - I see. Exactly what evidence do you have? - The photographs. The photographs you missed ferreting in the wrong place. - You must not approach this man. He may be-- - Hurry, Detective Chenko. The Lord is impatient. - Mr. Boon, listen to me, is your son there? If he's there, could you put him on the line please? (dial tone) Greaves, get me on the first flight to Springvale. Get the film in this developed immediately and issue an ASM on Boon to the Springvale police. - Is this the place? - Yeah. Listen, let's come back tonight. - It's my call. Let's go. (knocking) Jack. Try around the back. (tense music) - Let's come back later. - Jack? (grunting) Oh Jack. What have you done to yourself? - Joe. Joe. It's Margaret, Claw's lady. I mean, Jack's lady. Let's go. We shouldn't have come back here. This isn't the time to play tough guy. He's got connections, Joe. Let's give it a miss. I'll get my stuff. We'll talk it through somewhere. (engine roaring) - You got a problem, Martinez? Huh? - You killed Jack. - Yeah, and you're next. (grunting) (gun firing) (horn blaring) (grunting) (explosion booms) - [Chenko] Thank you. - [Taylor] Detective Sergeant Chenko? - [Chenko] That's right. - [Taylor] Sergeant Taylor. - [Chenko] Sergeant. - Haven't found your Boon fellow yet, detective sergeant, but there's been a few sightings. - Oh well thanks for your cooperation, sergeant. - You got us on the half of it. Had a girl killed her last night. That's you in the car. - When was she found? What was the MO? - Oh nothing even if you're a detective. Straight out hit and run. - How can you be so sure? - A young fellow turned himself in this morning. No matter you shape it up, it's a tragedy. If I had my way, I'd hang the bastard. There's your facts. (wistful music) (sobbing) - Yeah, but you're absolutely sure that that's the order they were faxed in? Yes, Greaves, I'm sure that you've checked. Could you confirm it with the negatives? I don't suppose there's been any response to that ASM on Boon, sergeant? - No. - What's going on? What's this? - I have to go away. I can't take it anymore. You can't keep doing this, Joe. It has to stop. - It has stopped. Everyone's dead. - Oh my god, what have you done? - They're all dead. Jack's dead. - Oh god. Make it stop. Please, just make it stop. - Jack is dead. - I'm not even talking about him. What about those girls, those poor girls? - What are you talking about? - How many more of your cute little fantasies have to be buried? I've already hidden one for you. Did you know that, Joe? I've done my part for you like a good girl. - What have you done? - Oh don't worry, no one will figure it out. You're a murderer. - Christ, what's this? - Look at it. That's what you've done. That's your handiwork. - What are you talking about? - Is that what you did to them? Those girls that you raped and murdered. I found that dead girl, Joe. I haven't told anyone yet. Aren't you gonna thank me? - What have you done? - I did what had to be done. - Look, there's no point in us going out there. There's enough people running around like headless chooks. - Here you are. That description might fit that ASM. - Let's go. Shane, where's your father? - I don't know. - Come with me. (thunder roaring) - Where are you going? - Away. - So you are gonna leave me here. - I've thought it through. Listen, Lee, I just wanna do what's best for both of us. Jack always said, "If you move fast enough, "nothing touches you." That's not true. No matter how fast I move, I always find trouble. It seems to be waiting for me. - We could start again, away from here. Don't you understand? I love you. - Hey, I'm doing you a big favor here, getting out of your life. - But I don't want you out of my life. - Lee, I've done a lot of bad things in my time, but I've never killed anybody. It's important to me that you believe that. (sobbing) (crashing) (crashing) Shit. Hang on. (metal scraping) (sinister music) (grunting) - Boon. (gun fires) Look at me, Boon. That won't bring your daughter back. - The Lord saith an eye for an eye. - [Chenko] And this is mine, saith the lord. - I am the instrument of the Lord's punishment. - Is that why you punished your daughter? - You. - You were the last to see her that night. I also have photos. - She was beyond redemption. - Going to kill again? - You contaminated my daughter. You fornicator. (fire roars) (screaming) (sirens blaring) - Let's walk away.
