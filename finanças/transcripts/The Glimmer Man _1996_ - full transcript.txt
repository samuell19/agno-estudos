- Hey, hey, what's up? - Hey, it's chicken-noodle Campbell. Hey, shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair? Coroner's report. Yo, man, why don't you just try crack? Mm. You call that humor. Oh yeah. The Captain says no more 976 calls. Mr. Love Beads, you gonna have to seek higher enlightenment somewhere else. I'm Lieutenant Cole. Been assigned to the case. They asked me to come back here and look through the file. Didn't mean to be discourteous. Nice to meet you. Yeah, I heard about you. I wasn't expecting you so soon. You worked, in New York, right? DeMarco killings? Yeah, well this ain't New York and this ain't DeMarco killings. We work as a team around here. You know, the way I work is, uh, I just kind of like to solve the case. I don't even care who gets the credit. Beautiful. That's that. We call this guy the ''Family Man.'' He's killed six families in the last eight months. All ritual killings. Have you found any connection between the victims at all? Other than the fact that they're all Catholic, ...which ties into the crucifixion ritual... no. They just found two more. Well, fresh kill. Today's your lucky day. Let's go. This ain't the same, Jim. Yeah, this is the first one in a motel. All the rest have taken place in their houses. Normally, we can ID the couple. But... other than that, it's pretty much the same MO. No, there's a lot more than that goin' on. I mean, this is different. So... so you married or what? See, this is what I hate about new partners. They always want to get personal. I don't want to talk about it, all right? Forget that I ever mentioned anything at all. So, you married, or what? No, I'm not married. See, every cop I know who's married, got a wife that won't sleep with him, ...two kids that don't listen to him, ...and a dog that'd rather lick himself than go fetch the paper. All units respond to a barricaded suspect with hostages, ...at the Saint Edmunds School. - Possible suicide. - Yeah, we're in that area. - Hey, man, what are you doin'? - Yeah, it's right over here. Nah, man. Now, see, that's suicide. We're homicide. Now, some dumb ass want to jump off a buildin', that's his problem. Somebody push his ass off the buildin', then call me. The way I look at it, death is death, you know, I mean... ...we gotta have compassion for the dead, the dying, ...the could-be-dying, and the about-to-be-dead. I'm going. I'm going. Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly. Detective Cole. Detective Campbell. What have we got? It's a boy named Johnny Deverell. He's a senior. He's got a gun and a class full of kids. Oh, that's nice. - What does he want? - I don't know. His girlfriend broke up with him. He's got her up there too. Has he been in any kind of trouble before? He was arrested for drugs. They had him seein' some kind of therapist. Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist, huh? Keep everybody quiet. Keep everybody back. Yo, man, you know this ain't our gig. Look, man, it's a lovesick kid. It's a well-armed lovesick kid. Why do you think they got SWAT? 'Cause they look good in black. All right, see if you can get me a couple of cell phones right away. Johnny, please stop it. They're gonna hurt you. Shut up now, Millie! I'm not in the mood for this! Put the gun down, Johnny. - Just put it down! - Shut up! Johnny, stop it! Please, Johnny! This is Detective Cole, LAPD. I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to help you. I gotta get into some kind of dialogue with you... ...before the guys in black get here, 'cause they don't listen to anybody. I don't want you to get hurt. I want you to step over to the window... and look at me. You'll see that I'm unarmed. Nobody move! Come on over. Step over to the window. And look at me. Sorry, Johnny. Put the gun down. I don't want to shoot you, and you don't want to be dead. Yeah, why not? Drop the gun! Come on. What are you on? Don't talk to me like you know me, man! You want me to start shooting?! You're right, I don't know you. I'm gonna put my gun down. We'll start out like this. Now, what's the problem? You don't understand, man. You don't understand. I can't go back with him. I can't, I won't. With who? You don't understand... ...I can't go back with him. With who? I can't. I won't. I love you, Johnny! I love you too. Oh... I love you too. I hate this job. - Calm down, son. - Wait! Watch your head. Calm down. Now, you see? SWAT would have killed this boy. You know it, and I know it. - You're not a freelancer, okay? - Oh, no. This ain't New York. No shit. Frank Deverell. It figures. Rich people's kids are always fucked up. Lieutenant, where will I find Detective Cole? - Right down there, sir. - Thank you. - Detective Cole? - Yes, sir. I'd just like to thank you from the bottom of my heart... ...for not letting my stepson take his own life. You look like a very sincere individual, and I... ...really, really appreciate your, uh... coming down. So nice of you. Well, I sincerely hope that if there's ever anything I can do for you... ...you won't hesitate to ask me. You'll be the first one I dial. Let's get out of here. Nice coat. Detective Cole... can I have a minute? I'm kind of busy right now. Well, I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell asked me to speak to you on... ...behalf of his stepson. - Uh-huh. About what? Well, Mr. Deverell feels your testimony would be very helpful... ...in getting Johnny acquitted on grounds of temporary insanity. Well, there's a little problem there, see, first of all, I don't think he's insane, ...and second of all, I like to testify as to what actually happened. Look, Detective... ...Johnny's been going through a very difficult time. Now, he needs treatment... ...not prison. Now, Mr. Deverell, well, as you may know, ...he's a, well, he's a very important man, and... a man of a lot of influence, ...a man who could... help or hurt a career. Just what is it that you do for this man? I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security. Oh. Could have fooled me. I kind of thought you were an attorney. Listen, I want you to deliver a message for me. You tell your asshole boss that nobody, nobody threatens me. I understand. I'll convey your feelings to Mr. Deverell. Now get your ugly white ass outta here. And don't come back. The motel victim had some... ...problems I thought you might want to know about. Besides bein' shot in the head and crucified? What are you gonna tell me, she had a bad hair day? She would have been dead in a couple of months. From what? I found advanced osteosarcoma... ...and interstitial fibrosis. If you don't say it in English, I'm gonna beat you to death with a dictionary. It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this cancer had spread throughout her body. - What would cause somethin' like that? - Now what am I? The Amazing Randy? We have tests to run, it will take time. What'd you come up with on prints? Nothin'. I don't think she's local. Neither do I. I don't even think she's American. I think she's Russian. Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy. Hair... cheekbones... ...genetic bone structure. I think she's Russian, most likely Georgian. You can tell all that just by lookin' at her? Yeah, right. She's an Aquarius and likes country music. Was... an Aquarian. You see, the spirit has left the body. What we have here... ...is a mere broken vessel. A broken vessel? Anything else interesting about the body that you'd like to comment on or...? She got nice tits. Precisely, grasshopper, but a little bit too nice. Okay, partner... run this number. Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate. That's the problem with new cops. They need to be taught who to pay attention to. I'd be happy to teach him that lesson. Put some of our Russian friends on it. Let them earn their money for a change. So... everything else in shape? Like clockwork. Everyone still in the dark? Oh, it's a very tight seal. As long as everyone keeps their mouth shut. They will. I think we've set a very good example. So, why L. A? New York didn't have enough psychopaths for you? Uh, I didn't get along with my captain. Figured it was time for a change. The ex moved out here with the kids. Yeah. Y'all just go on and nee-how-ma. Oh, no thank you, I don't know you that well. No, no, no, that's tea, that's good stuff. That's deer antler, it's good for your masculinity. Man, there ain't nothin' wrong with my manhood, thank you. Let me just have a little sip. Hey, this is my favorite movie. Do you know I'm black? I have no idea what you're saying. She says that movie always makes her cry. Oh, yeah, that's a real tearjerker. I mean, not that, you know, not that I cry at movies or anything like that. I just... you know... I mean, it takes more than a sad scene to break me, you know what I mean? Once in a while you should cry 'cause, like, it cleanses the soul. You know, you could use a little bit of that. If I need cleansing, I have a bran muffin. Thank you. You ain't gonna find one here. Oh, shit. Man, I think I'm allergic to the incense. Y'all sell roaches? Damn, I'm in the wrong business. I could make money and never leave my apartment. Oh yeah, just put this underneath your tongue. It's perfect for allergies. It'll clear you right up. Oh, shit. This is bitter, man. Bitter? I don't know why it would be bitter. What is this? Oh, it's just a little bit of... ...powdered deer penis. That's real funny, man. Real fuckin' funny. Damn you, I feel violated. So tell me, man, what's up with the beads? These here? It's called a mahla. Tibetan prayer beads. What do you use 'em for? Well, I use them to calm my mind and to purify my thoughts. Yeah, I use Jack Daniels. See, now, we're tryin' to go to the same place. We're just usin' a different technique. Except I don't wear the bottle around my neck. Yeah, because you'd lose your job if you did. Roden to 4 King 63. Just got a call from an informant... ...who claims to have info on the Family Man. Says he'll only give it to you guys. Waitin' for you on the south dock. This is 4 King 63. We're on our way. See? They're breakin' into that car over there. Look, man, we're here to meet an informant. We don't have time for that. We're police. We gotta go get the bad guys once in a while. You know, why don't we just get you some red boots and a cape... ...and you can fly around the city and stop all the crime. Police! Freeze! You know what pisses me off?! When I see a bunch of sorry-ass motherfuckers... ...like you with more hair than me. Now, turn around, put your goddamn hands up on the car... ...before I go get my clippers and go crazy up in here. Fuck you, pig. ''Fuck you?'' Did he say fuck you? I'm confused. We got the badges. We got the guns. You got a screwdriver. It's kind of like, you know, takin' a screwdriver to a gunfight. And ''pig'', that's an old phrase. Y'all must not be from around here. Y'all must be from another country or... Drop the guns. Please. Look now, this is a police matter. It got nothin' to do with you. Drop the guns. Think we're gonna have to do this the hard way. I can't fight, man. What do you mean you can't fight? It's a fine time to tell me now. Get down on your knees. Now. He likes you, that's the good news. Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie. Your friend likes to do things the hard way. Now, how about you? My friend, you know, he's a little bit country... I'm a little bit rock n' roll. What does that mean? Just an expression. What do you want? You... dead. Why? Because the pay is so good. Well, how about if I double the pay? You have balls. But I don't think you have enough money. Well, I do. I got thousands of dollars in my pocket. I'm gonna reach into my back pocket slowly to get my wallet. I have a lot of cash... ...or... you could take plastic. Plastic! Let's rock n' roll. You know... for a minute there I forgot you said you can't fight. It's not that I can't fight, I'm not supposed to. It's against my religion, you know? - Oh, great. - I'm a Buddhist. Yeah. You're a Kung Fu priest. Who sent you, man?! The Russian mafia. - Let me try. - You speak Russian? A little bit. Answer me, goddamn it, before I beat the shit out of you, you dumb ass! - You speak good Russian. - Yes. Black Russian. Read him his rights even though he's a little unconscious. He knows 'em. I'm tellin' you, Captain, this guy is weird. Yeah, show me a cop who isn't. Look, I'm not talkin' about a cop who wears pantyhose. This guy, he speaks Chinese, he-he dresses like a monk, ...and the Russians yesterday, he took them out like Bruce Lee, only better. I mean, I saw him use his credit card like a goddamn Ginsu knife. Where in the hell would you learn somethin' like that? I don't know, maybe the Army. What do you want me to do, Jim, look at his resume? Don't come to me with this kind of shit. Just work with the guy. Work with the guy... What does this say to you? ''P unishment and purification.'' He believes he's helping these people by turnin' them into martyrs. Only he can't get any satisfaction, ...so he keeps doin' it... gettin' bolder and bolder... ...until he's either caught or killed. And he ain't gettin' his orders from the Devil, either. He believes he's listenin' to Jesus himself. You learn well, grasshopper. Task force, Campbell. All right. Two more bodies. Hey, hey, slow down. It's all right, man, we'll be back later. Hey, man, get this virgin off the crime scene. We got Andrew Dunleavy... a psychiatrist... ...and this is his wife Ellen. There are two children, ...but we haven't been able to locate 'em. Hey, yo, Roden... ...squash that, man. Hey, you all right, Jack? - Jim, you got a minute? - Sure. Careful, he wants to borrow money. I know that look. - Got somethin' for you to look at. - What is it? Found a print at the Dunleavy scene. On the woman's body. Oh, beautiful. It's about time. - Let's run it right away. - Already did. It's Cole's. Your brother still work Intelligence, right? Tell him to find out everything he can on Cole. Off the record. Okay... we're gonna extend the house to house canvas by four blocks. We're lookin' for any links between the victims. Where they shop, ...where they get their cars repaired, pictures developed, ...anything, no matter how small. Philly, do me a favor and get me copies of these blood paintings on the walls... ...in this particular stack of crime scene photos. Send 'em out to every psych ward... ...and prison throughout the United States. Maybe a former patient. I don't know, I just think that, uh, ...this work is so unique that any prisoner psychiatrist or priest... ...would definitely not forget it. All right, everybody knows what to do. Let's go. No, I understand. I'll get there as fast as I can. Thanks. Hey, you're home early. What's up? Well, I have a new patient. They don't think she has a long time to live, so... Hey. What's wrong? No, there's been another killing. Same guy? Yeah. I'm sorry, Jack. He killed Ellen and her husband. He did what? I gotta go tell my kids... ...that their mother is dead. Oh, Jesus, Jack. I think he's makin' it personal, you know? Westlake Security. Yes, I'd like you to tell Mr. Smith that Mr. Jones... ...needs to contact him... right away. I think there may be a problem. Spit it out, son. Mr. Jones, he's asking to see you. Really? I wonder what took him so long? What would you like me to do? Ignore him. He's being dealt with. And we have bigger fish to fry. Whatever you say. ''T en Ways To Spend Your Weekend.'' This is all we could get on Cole. Let's see. NYPD, Homicide, Task Force Command on the DeMarco... ...serial killings. Lots of medals, good cop. He tracked down the DeMarco killer, ...shot him on a rooftop, one on one, ...and then was busted for actin' without sanction. Two coffees, Raffi. Extra sugar. - No coffee for me. - They're both for me. Anything else? Nothin' in the military records. Almost nothin' before the NYPD. Looks like this guy came out of nowhere. Oh, man, you tellin' me we don't know nothin' about this guy. Oh, yeah, there's one thing we know for sure. He used to be married to the Dunleavy woman. Son-of-a-bitch. In my Father's house, there are many rooms. If it were not so... ...would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? Thomas said to him, ''L ord, we do not know where you are going.'' Jesus said to him, ''I am the way. And the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father, but by me.'' Why didn't you tell anybody it was your ex-wife? You know they would have pulled me off the case. Yeah, well, you should have told me. We're workin' together. Well, I didn't. We IDed the couple at the motel. Eugene and Sonya Roslov. Russian, just like you said. Any connection to the others? Nah. They weren't even Catholic. There goes that theory. What's next? What...? This is empty. It's everything we know about you. Your background's nothin' but smoke and mirrors. Who are you, Jack? I can't get into it right now. Yeah, well maybe you can get into this. We found your print at your ex-wife's house. Well, she was my ex-wife, you know, I pick up my kids there all the time. The print's on the body. Planted. Yeah, right, and there's a puff of smoke comin' from the grassy knoll. What kind of bullshit you tryin' to run, man? I ain't always been a cop. That's all I can tell you right now. Look, you are one mysterious motherfucker. Nobody seems to know anything about your past, ...and the only piece of evidence I got... ...points right at you. Now, does that worry you, Jack? Do I look worried? Well, it damn sure worries me. Hello, Lento's. No, I'm sorry, we're closed. - No. It's a private lunch. - Excuse me. There is nothing I can do. I'm trying to tell you, see, we're closed today. Tomorrow we'll be open. It'll be fine. You come then. Okay? It'll be a nice lun... Excuse me a minute. Hey, asshole, what are you blind?! We're closed, okay?! You kind of talk too much, you know? Yeah, go ahead, come on over, we'll give you a table. You're unbelievable. What are you... What are you doing here? You need to turn around and leave. That's what you need to do. You don't call, you don't write. And what's worse, you don't take my calls. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir... ...Senator. Look. Why don't you and I take your little sensitive pony tail, ...and your little sissy beads, and get outta here, okay? As I was saying... ...Senator, as you can see, some urgent business has just come up. Thank you, Senator, so kind. It's been such a long time, Jack. That is the name you're using now, correct? At the moment. Can I get you a bite to eat? The food is truly wonderful, although... ...the service does leave a little bit to be desired. Listen, cut the shit, I need some names, names of consultants. Don't tell me there's a problem you can't take care of yourself? It's about the serial killings, and I know you know all about them. Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen. Wonderful woman. You know, the last two murders were definitely the work of a pro... ...not a serial killer. And I just have the feeling that you might know who this pro is. Well, let me guess. They've discovered... ...your checkered past, and now they suspect you. Not exactly. You see... they're still not... totally up on my past yet, but I know you are. Therefore I'm sure you realize what I'm capable of doing to you... ...if I have to. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, I do. What kind of consultant you lookin' for? Oh, this individual gives me the impression that he's a freelancer. Hiding his targets in the scenario... ...of a serial killer. Likes a.22, likes head shots. Seems to be inflicting costume wounds on the victims after they're dead... ...and... has excellent cleaning skills. Well, I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled, and my ears open. Right now, that's just not going to be enough. Well, Jack, now, you know there's a problem. I'm kind of busy right now... ...testifying before Congress. They're getting kind of cranky about where we get our core op funds, ...but, as it's you, and... ...I'll certainly do the best I can. For old times' sake. Good to see you, buddy. Bye, buddy. You ever pull that shit with me again, I'll kill you... and all your little... Chinese moo-shoo pork potions in the world will not save you next time. You know, you shouldn't knock Chinese potions. I have something in my pocket right now... ...that'll completely clear up that bruise on your forehead. What bruise? That bruise. Do you validate parking? Hello, Lento's. No, no, no, that won't work. We're closed for renovation. I'd say... ...two months. Yeah. Thanks. Look, Farrell, you're chasing your tail with this one. He probably bought it at a flea market. No way we're gonna find him there. We're gonna have to go back to basics. You guys gotta do your canvassing. - Your phone is ringing. - You're not listening to me. Read my lips... talk to the people! Detective, my name is Melanie Sardes. I think I know who you're looking for. I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner, Detective, but I don't open... ...my mail every day. There's so much, it kind of gets away from me. Well, I used to teach art two days a week up at the prison. Do you have a cold? No, I'm allergic to the incense. Oh. Can I get you something? No, thanks. I'm gonna go suck on some deer penis. I'll be all right. It's a Chinese deer penis. You put it under... You were saying? Well, I knew the drawings you sent were familiar. Especially the halos. Then when I saw the Titian crucifixion... ...it just clicked. He was my favorite student. See, my whole approach is organic. I start on the inside influence, ...and then I try to draw on the student's inner life. It's about having them find the moment. A moment without... Melanie, I've got to hurry back to the nineties now. Could you just give me his name? Christopher Maynard. - We're moving pretty fast on this. - Yeah, I know. Speaking of which, where's our warrants? Wait, give me a minute, I'll go get them. What's goin' on? - You didn't hear? - No, I didn't hear. We got a make on the killer. Name and address. We're just waitin' for the warrants. Well, thank you so much for tellin' me. Well, I figured Campbell told you. Yes, get me Research. Listen, would you do me a favor and check and see if there's... ...a Catholic Church within a 9-block radius of 929 Barrow Street? Bless me Father, for I have sinned. I had this feeling I was gonna die today! Christopher. This isn't gonna work, buddy. Here in a church... ...with the priest? I don't want to be hurting people. I don't like to. Could I please speak... ...with the priest? Could I have your permission to please speak with the Father a minute? I know you don't want to hurt him. Father... ...come here, please. Right away. Get outta here. Are they searching for me? Yes, sir, they are. How did you know I'd be here? Well, I just took a lucky guess. It's the closest church to your home. You're the new cop they brought in, right? Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know that? I keep track of these things. It's part of my job. So you know... ...you killed my ex-wife, don't you. I want you to know I didn't hurt her. You didn't? I only kill who I was told to kill... ...who I had to kill. The Roslovs? The Dunleavys? Did you kill them? I was spared them. Someone else was called. Who was given the call, Christopher? There's too much pain here. I gotta go now. Listen to me. You stay! Listen to me. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. The time of my last confession... ...was six months ago. - Christopher, please... Then you help me. - You help me. - I can't do that. I am in hell! I am in hell! Listen to me. Listen to me. Do it now, or I will kill you! You believe it?! - One... two... - This is God's house. - Don't make me do this. - Please. - Don't! - Three! This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me. This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man. I can't win for losin', man. I tried so hard not to let this happen. Look, we tossed his house, we found all kinds of shit, barbed wire, spikes. - He was definitely our guy. - Oh, shit. What the fuck are you doin' here? Well, I just thought that, uh... ...he wouldn't be home, ...maybe find him at the church. So, you came to blow him away? No sir, he drew on me, tried to kill me. I had no choice. No choice? The priest told me you let him go. Said he was calm. And we'll never know, will we? It's just like DeMarco in New York. You come out alone... ...the suspect is dead. Listen, Captain, we had a positive ID on... Shut the fuck up! I don't want freelance cops working for me! I want you... and you... ...Internal Affairs, tomorrow morning. Don't be late. Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly. So, what'd you tell him? Everything. The prints, the bullshit past, the whole nine. You didn't leave me any choice, Jack. Hey, that's what friends are for, right? I'm going to start by asking you a couple of test questions... ...just to establish a base line. Please answer yes to both questions. - Are you Detective Jack Cole? - Yes. - Have you ever climbed Mt. Everest? - Yes. Okay. Let's begin. You've been a police officer for seven years? Do you know how your fingerprints came to be at the crime scene? Are you withholding information pertinent to this investigation? Did you shoot Christopher Maynard? Was it in self-defense? Did you kill your ex-wife? Have you ever killed anyone? Have you ever killed anyone outside of police duty? I don't think that's pertinent to this investigation. It's a yes or no answer, Jack. Is it? There's my answer. Hey, don't do yourself any favors, Jack. I've never seen anything like this. Everything reads true. Look, can someone learn to beat this thing? It's possible, but you'd have to have total control... ...over your emotions. I don't know anybody who could pull that off. What do you want me to do, Jack? Prints thing's bad enough, but jerkin' the poly off... ...just leaves us with our dicks in the air for all your fans out there. You gotta tell me which fans you're talkin' about. I have so many. I'm talkin' about Frank Deverell. He's talkin' to people about you. Like who? Like the DA. About how you never should have been on the scene with his kid. About how you put him through a window. You know, I wonder if that's the same Frank Deverell... ...that came and thanked me on bended knee... ...for not shooting his son in the goddamn head. Yeah, things change. Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack, ...which means they're lookin' at me too. I'm gonna suspend you until we can sort this shit out. You know, I somehow think that you know I'm gettin' screwed. Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads. No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack. You're officially a suspect in the murder of your ex-wife and her husband. So, give me your ID, give me your badge, and make sure we know where you are... ...'cause IA is comin' for you. Which one of these did you just piss in? Son-of-a-bitch. Yo, Capt., you wanted to see me? Christopher Maynard was with his churchgroup in New York for two weeks. Yup, keep me posted. Accounted for every minute. There's no way he could've done the last two. Cole? You tell me? He was havin' a custody battle with his ex-wife. She didn't want him spendin' too much time with the kids. Listen to this. When he was in New York... ...the DeMarco killings started 2 months after he got assigned to homicide. He moves out here eight months ago. Exactly two months after that... the Family Man killings start. Maybe we should see what he has to say. What, are you goin' soft on me, Jim? Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself. Just let Internal Affairs handle it. They're puttin' a case together right now. Stay away from him. He's bad news. I take it something's amiss. What was he doing there? Didn't look like he was after anything specific. Just fishing. Nothing to worry about. Got halfway through the place. Nothing there to connect you to the Roslov woman. I hope not, for your sake. You should've gone through that house days ago. I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup. Where is she? Have you seen her? No, Mr. Richard, I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel. But this note came just after you left. ''I cannot go with you... ''... or ever see you again. - ''I love you, my darling.'' - That's the last call, Mr. Richard. ''God bless you.'' - Hey, what's happenin', man? - Hey, what's up, man? - What the hell you doin' here? - Gotta talk. - Those aren't tears, are they? - Ah, no, man. My eyes leak sometimes when I yawn, that's all, man. - They leak? - Yeah. - They leak. - What you want? - Let me just... - Wait... I'm fine. What do you want? - I gotta talk to you. - All right, come on. What if there's a serial killer out there... ...he's killin' families, we nickname him ''T he Family Man.'' But there's somebody else out there, ...who's got somethin' more sinister goin' on. He has to terminate some targets. So, he kills his targets and their entire families to make himself... ...Iook like ''T he Family Man.'' While we're lookin' for a serial killer. When in fact, there's two of 'em and one of 'em's a pro. - How do you know it's a pro? - 'Cause I know the work of a pro. I found this in Sonya Roslov's house. It's a round trip to Moscow, ...bought and paid for by Deverell Industries. So, you think Frank Deverell has somethin' to do with this? I do, sir. Now, Sonya Roslov, she was a translator. I mean, ...if Deverell did any business in Russia, It makes sense he would hire someone like that. - What if she was a mule? - Smuggling what? Chemical weapons of some kind. I mean, you know, now that the wall fell... ...there's a ton of that stuff floatin' around everywhere. That would explain the cancer in her body. And if you look at who controls that stuff on the black market, ...it's the Russian mafia. - As in the guys who jumped us. - You got it. So, what connects the Dunleavys to Deverell? I don't know yet, but... ...I know we could find out. You know, they will take my badge if they find out I'm workin' with you. But, my gut tells me you might be right. - And I always go with my gut. - Okay. I don't know about you, but... I'm gonna go see the rest of this movie. Is it a good movie? You never seen Casablanca? You're asking me if I've ever seen Casablanca? Well, have you? You gotta be kidding. Me? Never seen Casablanca? Have you ever seen Casablanca? No. Come on. And of course, Donald survived with everything but his pride intact. I never expected Cole to get this close. I thought you kept better track of your ex-employees. No way to anticipate he'd become this involved. Who is he? Obviously not just a cop, hm? He was a brilliant soldier. West Point, that kind of thing. I found him in Vietnam. Recruited him for a special projects unit. The Program, we called it. He handled a lot of... ...odd jobs for us. - Such as? - Now, Mr. Deverell, ...don't ask about things you don't really want to know. Suffice to say, to the people he hunted for us... ...he was known as the ''Glimmer Man.'' There'd be nothing but jungle... ...then a glimmer... ...then you'd be dead. Why isn't he still with you? He was booted out of the program in '84. Went native on us. Made up his own assignments. Disappeared... for months. Ended up... in Thailand... ...chanting in some temple or other. They say he was saved by a holy man. So many stories about this fella, I don't know which ones are true anymore. - What do we do about him? - Broom him. Time to lose everybody who knows anythin'. And I mean... everybody. Johnny's no threat. I beg to differ. He's already spilled to the shrink. The poor boy... knows too much. Simple as that. Johnny'll do what I say. Let me put this another way. I have four loose links in this operation... ...two cops, you... and the boy. Three of you have to go. You can choose which three. You'll have to do it yourself. Frank, I'll take care of Johnny. Who's gonna take care of Cole and Campbell? I'll put Donald on the others right away. That's the spirit. Now, come on in. The water's fine. Shit! Take the kids upstairs. - John Cole? - Yes. Miller and Russo from Internal Affairs. We have a warrant for your arrest. Do you want to take a minute to... gather a few things? No, that's perfectly all right. I'm ready to go. Coldest winter I can remember in L.A. Wettest too. They got you too, huh? No, I bought all this shit after the riots. It means we're close, man, we're close. Do I look like I give a shit? You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't gonna stop till they get us both. Does this say ''deer antler?'' Give me... Give me that. - It was a free sample, all right? - There's a whole case over here. Man, just stay out of my shit. Can I just take this moment to tell you how moved I am deeply? Yeah, well, that makes one of us. I found somethin' on your ex-wife's phone records. Somebody called the house the night she was killed. They called six times, only talked about 10 or 15 seconds each time. You got a number or somethin'? Hey, could I take those Cds? They look like I could still use them. Got it. Come on. Could I ask you somethin'? Did you actually live in this shitbox? Man, will you come on? Now, what if this is really our guy? - We reason with him. - Right. - What? - Police! I'm Detective Cole, this is Detective Campbell, ...with the Los Angeles Police Department. We'd like to ask you some questions about some phone calls... ...you may have made to a Dr. Dunleavy. You look like you just came from a riot. Thanks. He looks like he just came from a riot? Yeah, this number's billed to me, but it's my daughter's phone. I know you, don't I? Yeah, you know me... you put my boyfriend through a window. High school, window. I remember now. You're Johnny Deverell's girlfriend, aren't you? So? So, I was just wondering... how long have you known Dr. Dunleavy? I don't... know any Dunleavy. You called him the night he was killed. Yeah. Well, it wasn't me. I don't need a shrink. We never said he was a shrink. Okay. Okay, I knew him... ...but I didn't call him. I wonder who did? Johnny did. When he got busted with the coke, they made him see a shrink. Shrink was Dunleavy, right? Millie. Let me tell you something, sweetheart... ...the games are over. I want you to tell me right now... ...why Johnny was making phone calls from this room. He was afraid to call from home? Why? His stepfather. Johnny knew some bad things he was doing. You wouldn't happen to know where we could find this boy, would you? His stepfather put him away... ...at Our Lady Of Angels. You don't think Deverell would kill his own stepson, do you? Right. Dumb question. Let's get outta here. - You all right, Johnny? - Yeah, never been better. Yeah, we need to ask some questions about your stepdad. He's a prick. Yeah, besides that. Did your dad kill Dunleavy? Yeah, I tried to call him, I tried to warn him, I swear to God. We know, we know. It's all right. All right, everybody just relax. Police. Why'd he do it? Okay, he had Donald kill his translator, because... ...she knew that my father was smugglin' in some bad shit from Russia. And I found out about it. So, he got all freaked out, and thought, I told Dr. Dunleavy. So he had Donald kill him and his wife, ...and made it look like the serial killer did it. Who was helpin' him? Some little guy. Southern accent... - Smith. - Yeah, the government guy. Who... so who's Smith? Well, you're about to find out. Sister, take this boy and keep an eye on him. Don't let anything happen to him. Don't leave him alone. Yes, of course. I'll take care of you, Johnny. Come. See you later, Joe. How you doin'? Why Jack, what a pleasant surprise... You know, in most states in this country, ...kidnapping is still a no-no. Hell, we don't even do it anymore. Do me a favor. Spare me the drama and... ...tell me a story. What's Deverell smuggling? I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? Goddamn Jack! What are you doin', man?! Deverell's killed four people to hide something, and I want to find out what. You're a fuckin' psycho. I don't know what the hell he's talkin' about. Well, you're a cop! Aren't you gonna help?! Okay. But I'm a really bad shot. - Stay out of this. - I'm just tryin' to help. Kill me if you like, you son-of-a-bitch. I still have no idea what you're talkin' about. Jack, I know we've had some harsh words in the past... I tell you I do not know... Okay... I need that hand. Jack, I need that hand. You know I will. Right about... All right! Time! Game over! God I miss you, Jack. So many young men today just won't go that extra mile. I miss you too, Smith. Now, what is it? Deverell is smugglin'... ...chemical weapons from Russia. I made the contacts for him. The deal's been brokered by the Russian Mafia. Would one of you gentlemen mind callin' me an ambulance? So, what's he doin' with this stuff? Deal's bein' done tomorrow. Some welfare hotel downtown. He's sellin' it to a bunch of Serbian freedom fighters. You mean terrorists. Semantics. You say a tomato... No, motherfucker, I didn't say tomato, I said terrorists. You work for the government. Why would you, of all people, help Deverell? To get rich, son. To get rich, why else? You got that? Yeah, I got that. Well, aren't you the grown-up spy? What do you want? I want you and your friends to leave me alone. Forget that I exist. I already have. Don't make me come back and kill you. - I won't. - Good. Gentlemen, leave us not forget... a little matter... ...of the ambulance. - Listen, I only shot you in one foot. Hobble to a hospital. Well, safe to assume, folks, that the rainiest winter in memory is over. Sunny and dry weather for tomorrow and really, for the entire five day period. Everything we could hope for in this part of the country... Deverell is smugglin' chemical weapons in from Russia. The deal's bein' brokered by the Russian mafia. - Who is this? - So, how's that, asshole? I know you're friends with everyone from the postman to the President, ...but none of these folks are gonna touch you with a ten-foot pole... ...when this shit gets out, you understand? Detective Cole. You are persistent, I'll give you that. Looks like I got somethin' you want, you got somethin' I want. - What might that be? - Donald. Donald's your triggerman, isn't he? I'm listening. I want him, not you. I want you to deliver him to me with a nice little bow and the murder weapon. I'll take it from there. You take the tape... my name gets clean... your name stays clean. Everybody's happy, how's that? Done. Why don't you meet me tomorrow? I'm doing a little business at a place called the Ovington Arms, downtown, ...apartment D-14. Would 10 o'clock be good for you? Why does this gotta be so complicated? This is not complicated. This is nothing but a game. Reminds me of an old Persian tactician, ...trying to teach his young troops strategy. That, later on, came to be known as chess. So, we're gonna bore 'em to death now? Young warriors used to like to fight head-on. Old warriors like to wait, ...let their opponents expose the board, work themselves into a corner. Time to go. Sun Tzu, ''A rt of War.'' Sun Tzu. Just keeps gettin' stranger. Donald's your triggerman, isn't he? I'm listening. I want him, not you. I want you to deliver him to me, with a nice little bow and the murder weapon. I'll take it from there. Take the tape... my name gets clean... ...your name stays clean. Everybody's happy, how's that? Done. Guess your ass just got sold down the river, shithead. This won't take long. Just a quick pick up. I'm sure it won't. Shabby, but chic. Either we're a little early... ...or our hosts are a little late. What the hell is going on, Donald? You tell me. You think you're gonna hand me over to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake. I don't know what you're talking about. You'll never get out of here. No, this is my show from now on. Positively Shakespearian. To be... ...or not to be! Time to go. Wait. Now, we don't know how many guys are in there. What do you want me to do? Wait till they all kill each other? Yeah. You know, with the old warriors are patient and, ...well, young warriors, they kill each other and... ...I mean, that's how we get to be old. I like that plan too. You listened to me well. That's what I told you in the bar, right? I don't know why I don't listen to myself. I'm stupid. Let's just wait. Drop the guns! Police! Put your guns down! Drop that fuckin' gun! Drop the gun now! Drop the gun, boy. Freeze! Just drop it! You too! Where do you live?! - Around the corner. - Well, get your ass around the corner! And take little Whoopi Goldberg with you. Jesus Christ. Showdown on Sesame Street. Big Bird pop out of one of these doors next. Hi! Out here! Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer! Oh, God, don't look down. Don't look down. Oh, don't look up. All right, hang on. Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea, man. I wouldn't have thought of that. - All right, are you ready? - Ready for what? For this. There's a window, Jack! There's a window! Is that your gun or are you gettin' excited, man? Get off me. Get off. Police business. We're right on outta here. - Can you make it down to the lobby? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right. Elevator was broken. Has anybody ever told you you're a real pain in the ass? All the time. You're not gonna hear it anymore. I'm gonna take care of you like I took care of your ex-wife. Here we are. You know, when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror... ...I think you're probably happy... ...pleased at what you see. And that disturbs me. So, I'm gonna take it on as my responsibility... ...to make sure that you never get to look in the mirror again. I woke up happy, I'm going to bed happy...'cause you're gonna be dead. Take your best shot. No, I said, ''Best shot.'' Boring. Is that the best you got, boy? If that's the best you got, I'm just gonna have to kill you. Is that all you got?! You don't look like you're gonna be wakin' up happy now. Hey, Cap. You're looking a little rough there, Campbell. Yeah, well, they say I'm gonna make it. Guess I owe you an apology, Jack. God, wouldn't that be nice? Well, you're not gonna get it. But I do owe it to you. Do me a favor, tell my wife I'm alive and well. You got it. - Feel better, kid. - Yeah. Say, Jack... how 'bout we not talk for a couple of days? Somethin' I said? It's just that ever since you started bein' my partner... ...I've been beat up... blown up... ...shot... kicked out a window... ...all my worldly possessions burnt to a crisp... ...basically, I'm homeless. Not one good thing has happened since I met you. Yeah, but you got to try powdered deer penis. That should count for something. Don't call me, Jack. Don't leave me a message. Don't fax me. If I see a bird on my window with a message on its foot, I'm throwin' him back out. Don't send flowers. Forget you know me, Jack!
