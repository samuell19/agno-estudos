SHOW US A SMILE! Find the comfiest position [reporter] The government reminds the public to follow the measures being implemented including the mandatory home quarantine as well as the dos and don'ts during this lockdown. [ringing] [ringing continues] What took you so long? It's Monday. I'm working. Boring! Couldn't wait for you so I went ahead and did my milk tea run. I mean, you wouldn't really come with me but just in case... I'll have this delivered to you, Mr. I-Love-Deliveries! You're so sweet. Is that all? No. Tom... Hmm? Are you ready? The world is already full of suspense and uncertainties. You just have to add more to it? [Gad] Trust me. This is worth it! Look here. It just so happened that this popped out on my feed... Oh my gosh! Tom! Let me guess. You got a new crush? Let's talk about that later. The online seller's messaging me. Look here for a sec. Later okay?! My delivery's arriving. [Tom] Is that Kendrick? [Gad] Would you believe he's on Facebook again? And check this out, my friend. Someone's an aspiring influencer? You still too busy for this? Wait! Is he still in Hawaii or is he here in the Philippines? [Gad] Why don't you add him to find out? [Tom] Nah. Good luck! Oh, come on! Anyway, you are welcome, my cutie puppy! Go ahead and reply to your online market thing. Talk laters. [ringing] Sir, sorry for bothering you. I just wanted to confirm something. [woman] Sir, the... Sir? -Sir, can you hear me? -[heart beating] Ah, sir! Sir? Yes? [woman] These are the only available goods... -[dings] -[gasps] [woman] Sir, can you still hear me? Ah, sir? Sir, the sweetened pork is sold out. I'll just send you pork belly... then just marinade it on your own. And sir, you weren't able to specify... Which hotdog do you prefer? The brownish one or the pinkish one? It's jumbo! [shutter clicks] TOM! WATCH THIS. NOW! NIGHTY! Hi, Tom! Tommy Tom Tom! Is it obvious that I just wanted to bother you? It's just that... when I saw Kendrick's profile picture earlier, I suddenly remembered all our college memories... with Mr. Nice-Guy- But-Can-Make-You-Cry. And since I'm bored and have a lot of time on my hands, I prepared something special for you. A video. A slideshow. So sweet of me, right?! [chuckles] I already told you this during our senior year, ever since our freshman orientation, I already had a crush on you. That's why I just had to be your partner in our science class. Cause I really felt we could have some chemistry. You're so nice and quiet. And you smell so good, like you never ran out of cologne. Until I learned that we shared the same brand! Now, you should thank me because if not for me you wouldn't have these stolen shots. Think about it. Because of me, you have all of these for posterity. Call me sentimental but we're talking about Mr. Popular here. I mean, I get so happy every time you get a chance to be close to him. And I feel so #BLESSED because during all those times you've cried over him, you chose me to be your witness. Promise! I will always be rooting for you. So, what's the point of this video anyway? Nothing! [laughing] I just know you give in so easily, Tom! But you also know that I'll always be your enabler. So even if you're busy with your work from home stuff I'm still pretty sure you're bored. So if you're planning to add him or not. That's all up to you. It's your choice! All I'm trying to say is... whatever you decide to do, you gotta tell me everything! Every single thing-- TOM! WATCH THIS! NOW! NIGHTY! [ringing] So, did you add him? I knew you were waiting for my call. Did you add him? He added me. Friend request. Confirm? Ignore? What? Haven't decided yet. [Gad] Boring! Sleep on it. Okay? I'm going to sleep now. Update me! There! I just accepted the request! [shrieking] [ringing] Hello? Ma? Honey, did you know your dad was apprehended by town officials earlier? I told him so many times that a quarantine pass is required. I explained it to him so many times! He even shouted for the whole subdivision to hear! He screamed at the officials saying he has the right to go out and... that they didn't have the right to apprehend him! Let me talk to him, Ma. Wait, son. Delfin! Your son wants to talk to you! Tom, my son? How are you, Pa? Very bad! I was next in line at the remittance center. The town officials took me, pushed me into their patrol car, and took me back here. I kept on yelling -- "I'm a senior citizen! I m a senior citizen!" I guess seniors have no privilege here. Pa, who are you sending money to, anyway? Who else? To you. Do we have any other children? You're such a big spender with all your delivery orders! Aren't you running out of cash yet? Just making sure you have enough for your milk tea. [chuckles] You get me so worried. [voice breaking] And it's all your fault! I told you to come back here so we can look after you! Who's taking care of you now? Pa, I have a job. I should be the one sending you money. Just take it easy. What's the point of your retirement if you're not going to spend it on yourself? Don't be too stubborn, Pa. Please. You know you've got diabetes. If you catch the COVID virus, you might not get to see your future grandkids. What?! Don't promise me a grandchild! You just promise me that you're safe and happy. Love you, son. Bye. Okay, Pa. [shutter clicks] MISS YOU, MA, PA. PLEASE TAKE CARE. -[message alert tone] -HOW ARE YOU, BRO? [shutter clicks] YAAAAZ!!!! GO FOR IT!!! ASSUP? *WASSUP? [ticking] Oh shoot! [ringing] Tom? Hey! Kendrick! Tom! Hang on, bro. Sorry, sorry! Tom! Wow! Long time, no see, man! How are you, bro? I'm all right. [chuckles] Damn right, you're all right... Still a man of few words, huh? Yeah, that's all right. But wait, why did you call? You're the one who called me. I did? -Sorry. Must have butt dialed. -Yeah. Glad you did though. Why's that? Nothing. Anyway, how you've been? Been holding to the good things, bro. It's been five years, right? It's cool I found you. Right... It's been five years. Right... You still got the same answers when I ask how you're doing though. Just your usual "I'm okay." Guess youd be just okay forever, huh? Cause I'm really okay. And I'm no different from you right now. How's that? We both got nowhere to go. Wow! Speak for yourself! I'm heading out. Oh, it's late. Hold on. For real? Yup! But bro, My man... Tom... glad to see you again. I'll talk to you later. I just have to take care of something. We should do this more often since I'm... I'm good. I'm here for good, bro. All right? Sure. And if you need anything, just call me, bro. Anything. Okay. I mean anything. Okay? [Gad] Bestie, if he really meant anything -- Can he do that for us?! Please Tom? I want to see him do that, Tom. We have to see him do that! Stupid! He's not gonna do that! I'm sure he meant anything I need. Not anything I want. But you want it too, right? Hey, let's not go there. I bet he's just bored at home and he was just going through his contact list... and he was at T. Don't you like that he likes T? What? Nothing! You're just scared to fall. What's new? Bet you he'll call again? Double bet. Tom, if there's a wheel, there is a car. Kidding! [giggles] Tom! [notifications alert tone] [music playing] [ringing] Hey. Sorry. Were you sleeping already? Just chilling. I was trying to, though. Are you okay? Yeah. I can't sleep. Me too. Hold on, let me fix my phone. Wait. Sure. Stay there. It's a little... There we go! Just a sec. Wanna hang out for a while? Let's drink! Crazy! Where? Here! Do you have a drink there? Shot! Where did you get that? There's a liquor ban. The grandmas and grandpas I'm helping out gave me some. Grandpas and grandmas? Hold on. I'll send you a link. There. Check it out. [Tom] "Go out with a purpose. Be a... Go-To-Ghost"? Go-to-Host. "Go-To-Ghost"?! [Kendrick] It's my pandemic mission. Senior citizens aren't allowed to go out, right? So, they just call a host. If you want to volunteer, man. Check it out, bro. You'd probably want to... be with me. What? You might want to join the team? So, you don't get bored there. Oh! Like the bake sale back in college. Bake sale? The bake sale you helped out with. And the campus clean-up. And that Hurricane Relief Drive. You'd do everything to skip trigonometry. Right! Screw trigo. You were my idol then. Idol, huh? Yeah. If it wasn't for you, I would've took that class twice! So, thank you! My tutor. Sir Tom. What about you? You live alone? Why didn't you go home to Bohol? The lockdown. Getting sick of it though. Want me to stay with you? You crazy? You can't come here. I know! Just messing with you! So, what keeps you busy these days? Are you working? I'm pretty steady. Working from home. Accountant, right? What? You know? I saw it on Facebook. Congrats, bro! Well, freelance. So I'm used to it. Even without an office. Sure you could work without an office... But can you still work without your Starbs coffee? Iced Americano. Black. What? You still remember? You wanna know why? Hey! Hey! There's something in my screen. There! All good! So, what were you saying earlier? That one. I was with you at the Starbs coffee shop when you bought that. Oh right. Wait. Cheers, bro! Huh? How? Just act like you're holding something. What? That's stupid. Come on, Tom! Ready? Don't keep me hanging, bro. For missed connections, bro. Wait, wait! Don't put it down. Wait a sec. There. [shutter clicks] Okay. All right. I know your love will Always see me through And oh There's nothing That I wouldn't do My heart goes with you -[ringing] -Now and forever Yes? Yes? What's up with this? "Yes"? I couldn't help it. Ooh! You made the first move! Love it! Okay! Tell me all about it! Come on! Details! [Tom] Well, he still knows everything about me. Like my favorite drink... What I do... It's awesome! I know it's been years but it felt like... we never lost touch. So, how are you feeling right now? Sunshine, Through all of the seasons Love you, For a hundred thousand reasons Good. He felt good? -My heart feels so light -[laughs] And the future's Looking bright Stupid! I meant my drink! When the rain Starts to appear And you want to disappear YOU'RE UP EARLY TODAY! I'll be there To dry your tears, baby THE GRANDPAS AND GRANDMAS HAVE TONS OF REQUESTS. [Tom] This lockdown is enjoyable. This life is enjoyable. Is he enjoyable? Yes. You can feel my warm embrace -Now and forever -[doorbell buzzing] -[teasing] -Stop that. I have to go. My deliveries are here. Wait, hide that smile! The rider might think you've got a crush on him. How's this? Yeah. That's good. [chuckles] Ok. Have to go. Bye. I'M GOOD. ALREADY ORDERED ONLINE. CALL YOU LATER! [shutter clicks] There are a lot of missing stuff! And some orders are wrong. Look at this! This isn't young corn! -I plan to cook chop suey. -Oh, sir. Sir, I really chose the youngest corn for you. Maybe it'll grow by the time this lockdown is over. Are you for real?! Sir, please don't return it for a refund. Help the delivery guys. Poor boys. They're really struggling right now. Okay, sir? Sir? But you're always like this. And my savings are already running low. Can we just-- Sir? My gosh! Sir? -Hello? -Sir, my reception's bad. -Hello? Miss? -Choppy, sir! [ringing] -Hey. -You look busy. What are you doing? Just annoyed at the online seller. Look! She sent me almost rotten produce. It's the third time now. Maybe it's their first time? I'm sure they're stressed from all those orders. Being a first-timer should never be an excuse. So, if it's my first time with something, and I did it wrong, you're not gonna give me some slack? Hey. Are you crying? Nah. It's the... onions. [chopping] [tapping box drum] Something to calm you. Just breathe. Relax. I get you. You do? Yes. You're the type who wants everything perfect... and planned... like my ex. So, you're single now? Uh-huh. You too, right? Good. So, I can talk about some plans with you? What? Is it okay if I share some plans with you? Plans? Uh-huh. I'm a little embarrassed but... Here. Open it. During these times of fast and unpredictable change, we only wish for stability and security. Here at One Life Financial, we offer you the most reasonable service programs... to give you and your loved ones the thing that you need the most- peace of mind. But first we would like to share- What do you think? DAMN IT. These plans look good! Competitive rates. If I didn't have an insurance plan, I would've availed that. [scoffs] Wow. You even watched the entire thing, huh? Tom, we really need to think of things like these nowadays. Why don't you get one? Are you crazy? I am? Why me? But, Tom... he was just trying to make an offer. You can always say "No, thank you." Or you can get the plan. Can you blame the guy? It's so hard to keep a job these days. So what's next? Same pattern again? A little favor and then bye? Is that it? Look at this, Gad. Don't you remember this? Whether it's 3 a.m. or 12 midnight, or any hour of the day, I'd answer all his messages right away. All of them! Instant response. Every time! All for his freaking trigonometry. I didn't even get to spend my summer in Bohol just to help him, remember? Hey! You didn't go home to Bohol cause you wanted to get advanced credits. Remember? So I'd have a reason to stay. You know that. And when he finally passed, not even a single reply! Felt like I was a spammer. You think he's so sincere at first. Like he really wants to hang out with you. So you'd feel excited cause -- Wow! "He's the school s heartthrob!" That handsome dude. Suddenly interested to be friends with you. Like he's really concerned about you... constantly texting and calling you... as if he's just super friendly. Turns out, he's just user-friendly. Damn it! So, friend... What'll you do about it? Nothing. Nothing?! What else should I do? So that's it? Nothing? You're not going to talk to him? You're not going to ask him? Even through text --- Maybe something like Hello, Mr. User! Remember me? We're friends, right? What's up? Bro, why you hurting my feelings? When I like you so much?! Nothing like that? Nothing at all? Nothing, okay? Tom, is that your final answer? Cause there's so much you can do, you know?! Damn, Gad! What do you want me to do! Damn you too, Tom! What was that for?! What did I do to you? Nothing! That's the point! Listen, Tom. Let me take you to a trip down memory lane. Remember back in college, I liked you so much, I did everything to make you mine! I even had to corner you! But at least I found out that I'm not your type after all! And look at us now! We're BFFs! Right? Now look at you! Crying and moping, bickering and complaining, but what're you doing about it?! Nothing??? You sure?!!! Wait, why are you getting mad at me? I was the one who got hurt. Does he even know he hurt you, Tom? Does he? Tom, Kendrick never even knew that you got mad at him back then! And I was the one who got dark under-eye circles and a bloated waistline for staying up late and getting wasted with you! Then you're going to calm down again... and when he comes back to your life, we'd just go through this cycle again?! We keep going in circles and all you do is nothing! You're such an asshole! Cause you're so stupid! You could've done so many things Tom but you're not doing anything! Okay! Okay! Damn! Fine! Hey. What did you do? AHH DAMN! HE SAID CATCH UP, BUT REALLY JUST WANTED ME TO SIGN UP! #agenttricks #userfriendly #k_NDRICK! -OMG WHO'S THAT??? SPILL -I KNOW HIMMMMMMM -I'M ALSO A VICTIM. -IT'S KENDRICK! HE INVITED ME AND MY FRIEND TO DINNER. PM IS THE KEY! HE'LL JUST SELL YOU STUFF! HE'S SUCH A USERRRR!!! SHIT BRO, WHAT'S THIS? [ringing] So, this is the first time I m doing an FB Live. 'Cause these online sellers annoy me so much! They've done this to me so many times! Acting all nice in their first messages. After you pay for everything, they just don't care about you anymore. WOW, YOU A VLOGGER NOW? Last week, it was Online Menchu Market. Now it's Boy Abundance Delivery. Look at this. ANNOYED AT THEM? OR SOMEONE ELSE? Rotten. Rotten. Rotten. LIKE HIM? Withered. Withered. Withered. LIKE YOU? Look at this! This isn't fresh! What do you do with this? LIKE HIS STYLE? Stop it with those comments! Oh my god! TOM? BRO? [message alert tone] I'M SORRY. [ringing] Hello? Hello, sir? I'm here in the lobby, for your delivery. What? I didn't order anything. Someone sent you these. Sir Kendrick. I think he's your kid? My kid? FROM YOUR GO-TO-HOST I GOT YOU TOO. LET'S DRINK PART-E TONIGHT! [shrieking] HEY THANKS. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? 300 PHONE CREDITS. I'M KIDDING. LATER. IT SHOULD BE A LAUGH EMOJI. [Tom] What do I do, Gad? He still hasn't called. Should I call him? -[Gad] Tom, you know the saying, -ARE WE COOL? - "Closed mouths don t get fed"? -LATER. DRINK PART-E. [Tom] Yes. [Gad] Time for dinner. Think about it. [ringing] Hi there! What's that? Where's your drink? Here. I disposed the cans. Less risk for the virus. But I already washed every can with soap for you. Anyway, cheers, bro! Cheers, bro! Cheers! What are you thinking about? You. What? I said you. Are you okay? I'm okay. I know you're not. I saw the post on FB. Felt like you were talking about me. You think? But seriously, do I really give you that impression? It's not that, Ken. It's just that... I'm sorry. I just thought you'd appreciate it. Had you said "no"... I mean, it wouldn't be a problem. Do you... want me to take down the post? Don't worry about it. But... Since it's just the two of us here, I got... a question. What? Have I done anything wrong to you? You can tell me anything. No hard feelings. Fine. I'll tell you. I just got annoyed because this lockdown's already been so stressful, then you offer me more things to spend on. That's it? That's it. Bro, don't worry about it. It's just a side job. That's nothing. As long as we're still homies. I've missed this. Are you drunk? Actually, I was really happy that I saw you online again. Remember the time I was at my lowest? I mean, I literally had the lowest scores in trigo? You were the only one there for me. You seemed okay that time. You were even so chill about it when you invited me to your place. I thought we were just going to hang out turned out... you just wanted me to tutor you. And thank you for that. Like what I've always said-- That's something I'll never forget. What are you doing? No way! You forgot about this? Whenever I finish a workbook right? [chuckles] Of course, I know that! I invented that. But... what for? Did we accomplish anything tonight? I don't know about you. But for me, I feel like... we did. Come on. Don't leave me hanging. Come on. Are we cool? Cheers, bro! Cheers! Wait, wait! Freeze! Stay there! Wait! One, two, three... All right! Okay. Cheers, bro! Cheers! [alarm ringing] [Tom] How many beers have you had? [Kendrick] Why, bro? Who's counting? I'm still good! [Tom] What's going on? You wouldn't call if you didn't have a problem. [Kendrick] Wow! What if I say, I just wanted to hang out with you? And oh -[Tom] If you say so. -[shutter clicks] -My heart goes with you -[shutter clicks] -GETTING USED TO THIS LOCKDOWN -Now and forever In love with you Every single day I know that you will love me Just the same -[shutter clicks] -Take my whole life too How are you, man? Don't say "I'm okay." Do you have a problem? I asked you first. How are you? Seems like there's nothing else to do. Sleep, work, eat. The usual boring things... So let's get bored together. [shutter clicks] I remember you being a scaredy-cat. Right after school, you'd go straight home. Unless I force you to drink. I even taught you how to ride a jeepney. All you knew then was book a car service. I didn't know anything about Manila back then, okay? So cute. Till now, right? If you say so. -Cheers! -Cheers! Cheers, bro! Some things are well And truly meant to be Let me do it! I'll wipe it off! Stupid! I got you. I got you, Tom. Kendrick? Do I make you smile? Of course, bro! You've helped me out so much! My heart feels so light And the future's Looking bright [shutter clicks] Stupid! -I already wiped it off. -[both laughing] You're funny. [laughs] And you feel like Second place [ringing] You look well-adjusted with this lockdown. Maybe 'cause you're not too adventurous. You're either busy or back home in Bohol. Why don't we go somewhere after this lockdown? La Union? Sure. Let's see. Nice! Anyway, talk to you later. I'm here. Hey, be safe, okay? Love you, bro. What? Likewise, bro. Okay. -Take care. -Bye. I like you too, bro. [laughs] Take my whole life too Cause I'm so In love with you [Tom] Wow! These veggies you sent look great! Told you. Impressed? Thanks! -Bro. -Yes? I wanna show you something. I told you I won't avail. You're dumb. Not selling you anything. Just check this out bro. [Kendrick] Since we have a lot of time, I'm challenging you to do some plating like that. You up for it? Those only look good on pictures. But once you try mine, it's definitely better. You made those? No. My ex did. You might know her. Trish Mabini. She's a Pinay chef in Hawaii. And she's from your hometown too! Nope. I actually mentioned about you when we first met. Really? I told her you're a homo boy. What? You're a homeboy, right? Ah, yes. That's why I never met her. Okay, sorry. Just thought you knew each other. -Hey, bro! -Yes? Once this lockdown is over, will you let me try your cooking? Why not now? There's more than enough here. Sounds like a plan! ARE YOU HOME? BRO, YOU WANT TAPA? So, Gad? What do you think? Ooh, such effort! Well, he challenged me. So, challenge accepted. You're one of a kind! But hey, do I get to taste that too? Why should you? You're not Kendrick. Oh my god! Seriously?! You've changed. [laughs] I'm kidding! I'll send you a box. Didn't forget about you. Thank you! I'm loving how you're so happy these days. Stay that way, okay? Come, let me take your picture! Hurry! -[clatters] -[gasps] Oh no. Oh shoot. [exhales deeply] YOU MADE IT? [ringing] Tom. Busy? [Kendrick sighs] [groans] Not really. Just tired. Let's just talk tomorrow then. No, no. It's fine. Stay with me. [Kendrick sighs] Sorry. [groans] I just remembered someone. Trish? Yeah. You know, Tom, back in Hawaii, when me and Trish were starting out, we were so happy. Bro, not even two years in we already talked about getting married. I did the odd jobs bro. With all the money that I saved, I spent it all on her. [Kendrick sniffles] [Kendrick sniffles, sobs] [exhales, sniffles] She was my life, man. I thought we were going to last forever. I thought she was the one. A few years passed by, things started getting rough. We argued a lot. I made mistakes. And... ...she tried to leave me. Everything just fell apart... I even drifted from my parents. I slacked on my job... I think that was one of the reasons why I came back to the Philippines. [Kendrick sniffles] Have you ever had that feeling? When you've tried so hard to do everything, yet you simply can't get what you want? That? Trust me... I know that feeling too well. But I've never heard you share about your love life before. [Kendrick sighs] That doesn't mean I've never had one. You wanna tell me who it was? No. But I know that feeling. When you try to do everything-- Even things you haven't done before-- Just to make yourself matter. But even if you try everything you can, you still remain unseen. And you don't know if you should keep going, or just give up already. At least Tom, [breathes heavily] I know you're always there. [Kendrick sighs, sniffles] Tom? [Kendrick gasps] I appreciate you. [sobs] AHHH FUCK!!! HE SAID CATCH UP BUT HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE ME SIGN UP I deleted the post. I already forgot about that but thanks. How are you? I'm okay. Tired I guess. Sure. Hey. How are you? [ringing] Are you ok? I think he just waited for me to remove the post. Hold on. Is he ghosting you again? I've been getting auto replies. Been two days now. Guess he just waited for me to delete it. It's over, Gad. NUMBER OF COVID-19 POSITIVE CASES SPIKED TO 29 What happened to you? [Kendrick coughing, groans] Kendrick? Tom. [coughs] Tom, sorry. Sorry I haven't called. I've been down since the other day. Thought I was just exhausted. Then I suddenly had chills. Having a hard time breathing now. Wait! What do you need? I'll call someone. Where do you live? - Wait. - Don't worry about it, bro. I already called for help. You sure? Sorry I won't be able to send you groceries today. What the hell? That's what you're worried about?! [coughing] [doorbell ringing] Tom... Don't hang up, okay? Stay with me please? Yeah. Of course. Wait. [Kendrick coughing] [door opens] [Kendrick] Good morning ma'am. Come in. [woman] When did you last leave the house and where did you go? Three days ago. I went to the market, grocery, and drugstore. Went to a cake shop too. You go out everyday? Almost. [coughs] So, you're one of those eh?! You think you're all invincible and can't catch this virus? Looks like it got you now... Whoa! You really have to blame him?! [woman] Who was that? [Kendrick] Just my friend. [woman] Let me check your temperature. 38.5 It's a little high but not too high. I'll tag you as a Person Under Monitoring. The hospitals are full anyway. Stay here and do self quarantine. Drink lots of water. Eat fruits and take vitamin c. Fuck! That's all you could prescribe?! He can't breathe! Bring him to the fucking hospital! Are you just gonna let him die?! - Goddamnit! - [woman] Damn that noise! So... How are you feeling right now? HOW AM I FEELING?!!! Ouch!!! Don't yell at me! [thuds] Hey! Hey! What are you doing? [slams, pounds] I GOT YOU TOO. [line ringing] Hey. Where are you going? Sorry, it's a little late. I thought I still had food in my apartment. Rest up. I'll take care of your food. Hey, you sure you know what to do? [coughing] Don't worry about it. You just need to get better, okay? Don't worry about the grandpas and grandmas. Send me the list. I got you. [panting] [man] Sir? Where are you going? To Kendrick Villaverde's. Sorry sir, no guests allowed right now. I can't let you in, but you can leave those here. But I won't take long! Doesn't matter, sir. You'd have to drop those off here. How about I drop these off to him, then leave right after? I can't allow that. It's management policy. I can take those up to the tenant for you. But these aren't even cooked yet! I need to cook these for him! - Hey, don't push it. - You don't get it! Don't push it, Sir! Told you you're not allowed here! Fuck that! [clattering] I told you I wasn't gonna take long! Told you you had to leave! Look what you've done to our floor! [indistinct chatter] [pants] Sorry, Drick. The guard didn't let me in. I got 'em Tom. Thank you. [Kendrick coughing continuously] You're just having your lunch now? I'm already preparing your dinner. And your breakfast and lunch for tomorrow. Sorry, might be too salty. Bro, can't even taste a thing now. [Kendrick coughing] [coughing] Kendrick! [Kendrick gasps] Relax, Drick. Just relax. [shivering] Rub your hands together. It'll keep you warm. [shivering] I'm trying to get some help, okay? Don't worry. [coughing] -[voice recording] -[Kendrick shivering] [Kendrick coughing] Just relax, okay? Just relax. You have the mug with you? Make sure it's warm. Make sure it's warm enough for you. [shivering, sobbing] [coughing] Just relax. [coughing] [Kendrick] Bro... Thank you. The nurse from the testing center you called, visited me the other day, I just got the results back. It is COVID. [coughs] [Kendrick breathing heavily] Do your parents know? I already called them. Bro... What? If I don't make this... Shut up! You'll get better, okay? You got this! [inhales, exhales] [coughing] Stay there please. Stay with me. Yeah. Rest up. I'll just be here. Get some sleep. No, wait! Don't sleep! You might not wake up! Crazy. Just take it easy. Think of the things you want to do after this... Or the places you want to visit, all right? I'd do whatever. I'd go wherever. As long as you're there too. [slow guitar music plays] [coughs] [Kendrick sighs] [groans, coughs] [notification pings] Kendrick... I learned you already left. Why didn't you tell me you were leaving for Hawaii? But since you're no longer here, I might as well tell you this. But... ...please keep this between us, okay? I miss all those times. And I never wanted them to end. 'Cause those times I've spent with you... ...those were the happiest moments for me, you know. [Tom] Recording. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Amorado! I'm Kendrick, Tom's classmate. I just wanted to say thank you very much... ...because without Tom, I would've failed my Trigonometry. For your anniversary, Tom just asked for a fan sign but I told him a video would be cooler. So, I heard this is your theme song and I tried my best and I hope you like it. No scars for us It makes a big difference that you get what matters to me. ...never return I gotta record this. So, my new classmate from Bohol has never ridden a jeep. And all the things that you made me do, were all those things that I couldn't have done... Are you good? We could've just grabbed a ride-share. Or you could just grab on to me. Relax, dude. Just chill. Hold on to the bars. You might fall. Yes! It's Tom's first time! Solid!!! [laughs] Having fun?! Babe, we're almost done. I'll pick you up after this. [coughing] Dude? You look terrible. Take it easy. You know when I'm with you, time flies so easily. And nothing else seems to matter. Babe, I think I'll just stay here. I'll look after Tom. I'm taking this video because guess what. I got high grades in Trigonometry. You know why? Because of this guy right here. Right my idol? Shut up. Come on, dude! Aren't you happy for me? Of course I'm happy! That's how we do it! Ouch! That hurts! You just have a way of making things better. And everything seems to be worth it. But in my dreams I'd still be coming home to you Sorry. It was an accident. It's fine. I could build a ship and sail [singing] But in my dreams, I'd still be coming home to you Mr. and Mrs. Amorado, happy anniversary! Hope you liked the song. Ma, Pa, happy anniversary! You owe me! I remember you'd always tell me that if I needed something, I just had to tell you. I guess this is it. I guess I need to tell you that... I think I love you. And it's okay if you don't feel the same way. Even if you don't talk to me after this, I'd understand. I just wanted to know [sniffles] where I stand with my feelings. [sniffles, sighs] Hey, Drick. Take care. You had that video all along. Why didn't you send it? I didn't have the guts. I almost sent it, then I thought, if he sees it, I might just lose him forever. [sighs] Dear, you've been imagining all these possibilities in your mind... But you'll never know if they could be yours... ...if you don't tell him anything. I know. [exhales] Take a look at this when you're ready, Kendrick. [exhales] [clicks] [ringing] Hello? Have you seen it, Tom? Seen what? Kendrick's Facebook post! Congratulations! [teasing] [joyful music playing] [music stops] Sorry, Tom. Are you okay? I'll talk to you later. Okay. [Tom sighs] [sobbing] [reporter] Cities in Metro Manila with high cases of COVID-19 It's getting dark again. Good news soon, please? Infections are rising--- But the number of COVID-related deaths... [reporter 2] 108 recovered patients have been recorded. The total number of patients is 1,842. Nights are getting longer. Longing to come out of this. [clicks] Soon, you will. Love you sweetie. [somber music playing] [shutter clicks] [notification pings] [clicks] [ringing] [ringing continues] Tom? Hey! How've you been? I survived it. Thank you. Of course. The video you sent, Tom... What was that? That? [sighs] Whatever was there.... ...is all you need to know. I'm sorry. I couldn't keep it any longer. Hiding from COVID's a lot easier than hiding away from those feelings. Actually, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're okay. Now that you and Trish are okay. I guess you saw that post. [laughs] That was for you, Tom. What? [sighs, tuts] Well, Trish called me when she found out I was sick. She just asked how I was doing. I deleted her comment right away, [clicks] thinking it might throw you off when you see it. You did see it. I told myself when I saw your video, the least I can do is to send you a reply. [sighs] Didn't realize I posted it on my wall. Tom, even if you didn't send that video, I already knew. I've been noticing ever since. I just figured that maybe it's something you didn't want to talk about. Tom, I'm sorry for hurting you everytime I leave. When I've been getting all these feelings I wasn't too sure of. I had to keep my distance, though I didn't really want to. But if there was one thing that never left my mind, It was you, Tom. You think you're easy to forget? You might have missed it. But that post was for you. Why are you crying? Nothing. Probably because I already told myself that, things are fine the way it is. As long as you're okay, then I'm okay. If this friendship is all I could ever get, then I'd take that. Why would I ruin something that is already okay, right? [sniffles] But when I heard you say all of those... I don't know. I don't know why. All those feelings I tried to bury came back... all of them. It's funny, right, Drick? I think I was just forcing myself to forget about it. But for the longest time I've known you, [Tom sighs] and for the longest time you've been gone, truth is... ...I've waited for this my whole life. [Kendrick sobbing] Shit... You're making me cry. [sniffles, sighs] Come here! I'm tired of that, Drick. Can I get a hug instead? [laughs] And how do we do that? I don't know. Maybe... when we could already come out? Of course. As long as you're ready. I will be. You sure? I am. [Kendrick sighs] Love you, Tom. Love you, Drick. [keyboard typing] ["Tagpuan" instrumental playing] ["Still" by Miguel Odron playing] [music stops]
