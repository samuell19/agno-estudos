THE PASSENGER PEST CONTROL Your country is full of them, right? I mean, full of believers. Ecuador... Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, you know? They're all faithful. The last ones the Vatican has left from whom to keep on stealing. Although Muslims are winning by a landslide. Here, only the elderly go to Mass. Of course. When my turn comes up, I'll do exactly the same. Just in case. And in Argentina... Oh my, Argentina. You know? They're also extremely religious. Because football... Football is the other great religion in South America, right? I'm not South American, I'm Mexican. Where's Mexico? In North America... Over here, in Spain, everyone below the US is South-American. I'm not being a racist, I also have South American blood running through my veins. My dad was from Argentina. She's a believer and has a vow of silence. Just what I needed! She can't even string two fucking sentences together. And it was clear in the ad: "Carlos Blasco, a responsible driver, smoker and very talkative." EXIT RESIDENTIAL AREA It's full of our guys, and they're all hyped up. They better chill out, I won't be there for another four hours. It's not because of you, bighead. They saw a flash in the sky. Don't tell me the Virgin appeared. - That's what they say. - Yokels... It was probably a flare. Exactly. Cadalso Street, here it is. - Come on, step on it and get here. - All right, kisses. Faggot. We're picking someone up. We're here. Hey, what's up? You're Lidia, right? What's wrong? Don't like it? It never mentioned it was that old. It's not old, it's experienced. I bet that you'll grow fond of it in 30 kilometres, wait and see. Just get there on time. Marta, let's go. This is included in the price, don't worry. I can carry my own suitcase. I don't want you to get hurt, madam, come with me. Brute strength is a man's job. Let's go. Careful. - Oh my. - I'll make some room here. - Shall I help you? No, that's not needed. This goes here. That one goes there. Hi. What's this? A sword. I used to bullfight when I was young. Do you know what they called me? "Nativity child." Can you guess why? - No. My birthday is on 25 December. I had to quit after my eye incident. I'm taking it to my cousin, a junior bullfighter. Do you like bulls? I do like bulls. I don't like them being tortured. Well... Lidia means "bullfight" in Spanish. Marta! Don't make me say it again, come on, grab your things and get in. Do we have a problem? - No. This is Mariela, from Mexico, she's also going to the village. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. And who's this? Huh? What's your name? I'm Carlos, but my friends call me Blasco. How old are you? In case you want to drive. - Can you stop being a fool? - Sorry, I didn't want to... What? Be rude? Treat my daughter like an idiot? Marta. I'm Marta. - Hi, Marta. - Come on, Marta, get in. I'm not sitting there. Don't make this any harder. I get car sick in the back. What? Come on, don't lie. Get in the car, Marta. - I'm not getting in. - Get in. Now. - I'm not getting in! - What if... What if we move it? I want to get to Valgarde tonight, if that's possible. So? FOR SALE Oh, Holy... What is it? What are you looking at? Do I have something on my face or what? Wrinkles. What a funny little girl. Hey, do you have a cigarette? I have one left. Don't even think about it. Excuse me? It was clear in my ad. Don't even think about smoking unless you want me to puke all over your dashboard. What the hell? What a brat. Well then? Why do you keep looking at my face? What happened to you? To my eye? Nothing. It was my first bullfight, with real bulls. So you're a bullfighter, huh? I used to be. And a good one at it. But anyone can have a bad day. A badly-placed banderilla that bounces off the animal... Straight into the eye. Tough luck. I bet the bull ended up worse. To the butcher's. Do you know what? I think you're lying. You're no bullfighter. I doubt it's because of that. What a smart-arse. Are you an eye doctor or what? No. But I know a thing or two. Damn... What happened there? Let me guess. You were going to smoke for the first time, and your lighter exploded in your face and that's why you hate smoking, right? Hey! Enough. This isn't funny at all. Because I'm one-eyed? It's not so bad, madam. What's this all about? Marta, fasten your seat belt. It looks like he's taking us to the pound. Please calm down, ladies, don't get all worked up back there. I installed that screen when I had my pest control company to stop the stench of chemicals. Why haven't you removed it? I left it there quite on purpose. For health reasons. To avoid getting a virus infection from a troublesome passenger. A female passenger, in this case. The cheek on him. I'll file a complaint on the site. On the site? No, it's best if you give him a bad review. That'll be much worse for him. He'll lose customers. - Really? Loads. And share all the details. That he was inappropriate with your girl, a misogynist, careless, that his car is a pigsty, look at it. - It doesn't even have seat belts. - It's so old... - Hey. - Yes? You know we're in the digital age, right? Right, but fuck that. The sound of the cassette is unique. Authentic. Vigorous. Damn, La Polla Records! Know them? I'd play it, but this cassette's been stuck inside... Forever. Nessa's clung to it. She's took a liking to it. - Nessa? - Yes, Nessa. My little girl. The love of my life. My van. My Va-Nessa. Anyway, at least it's an auto-reverse player. It switches sides, otherwise it would drive us mad. You can't deny that the pasodoble is amazing. - I prefer Dua Lipa. - Yeah... So cool. She's from Cuenca, right? From a nearby village, yes. Oh, wow. That's right, run! Champ! You might even make it to see your wife cheating on you. Keep your rudeness to yourself. None of us want to hear it. But it's true. Men who drive like that do so because they know their wives are... Their wives are what? Never mind. I love women. I love them. I love my mum and grandma, may they rest in peace. So you're entitled to say whatever you want about us? He'll say he's a feminist next. I'm not getting caught up in that. No fucking way. Feminist... Vade Retro. All feminists want is revenge. Revenge? Do you really believe that? That we're primitive like you men? That's not the case! Don't worry about that. In a few years, let's see how things are in the legislative framework. Look at her. Prime example. He's so backwards, guys like him should go extinct. - We'd be all alone. - Check them gossiping back there. You're monsters! - I don't care. - Great, be all silent. You're prettier that way. Marta, pass me some sweets, please. That'll be hard unless we stop. No. Check this secret out. - I like Nessa. - No shit. We've been together for so many years... I'll work up the nerve one day and ask her to marry me. Are you taking the national road? Someone rich would pay 20 euros, take the motorway and do an extra 40 kilometres. That's not the case, madam. Your ad said no detours! One thing is no detours, another is no tolls. In fact, I'm not taking a detour from the route. Quite the opposite, it's most direct route. And the cheapest too! Son of a... Besides, we'll be able to see and enjoy the Osborne bull on this road. A trip without the bull is bad luck. What's wrong, don't you like the scenery? It's astonishing, right? Don't bother. I know this road perfectly. Really? Are you from Valgarde? Not me. My ex-husband. Oh, of course he's your ex. So you're going to see your dad, child? My mum wants me to live with him. She's tired of me, you know? I'm a bother. Marta, don't talk nonsense. We both agreed on it. And stop biting your nails! Don't worry, child. All mothers love their child. Even yours. I don't care. Neither of them cares about me. He left. And now she's abandoning me too. Fuck! Stay there! This might be toxic! Stay there! What the fuck are you doing? Is this a crashed Meteosat? Don't touch that! Fuck, that's disgusting. What's... Is that a...? Are you OK, darling? - Yes. Let me check, please. Let me check your finger! - Stop! I'm fine. Don't be a pest. - Marta! Marta, come on! You're staying there. If this belongs to the government, it's best not to touch it! Come on! Let's go! Holy shit, what did we just witness? Did you see? I bet... I bet it's what the guys saw in the village. Fuck. There have always been strange sightings in this area. Oh... God. - You're going to see the miracle-worker? - What? Your hair... Oh, God... It crashed or it was brought down. That's the target of the next World War. Telecommunications. Did you read that or is that a theory of yours? No, child. Don't be naive. They spy on us 24/7. 24/7. Why do you think I have an old phone? They'll never catch me. - It's not because you're stingy, yeah? Oh... little girl. Your fancy device, Japanese, Chinese, or from wherever, is always listening and recording everything you say. Test it. Let's talk about any subject, and in no time, you'll start receiving notifications, ads... You'll see. Test it! - Come on! - I will. - Try it! Come on. - Let's see... Is it bad? It's spread everywhere, but... I don't like telling people. Not even my family knows. I don't like pity. Don't tell anyone. No. I won't. Relax. No. Your theory doesn't hold up. - What do you mean? How come? I'm not getting pasodobles on Spotify. You're so annoying. Stop biting your nails! You're bleeding. Your mother will see you. Oh, no way... I think Nessa needs some love. - How do you fix it? - It doesn't get fixed. It's up to Nessa. It's just about the Virgin. I don't doubt her kindness. But I doubt she'll make an exception for me. I've seen many people... Because I've taken care of them. Many, many... And I've seen them pass away, people healthier than me, with no chance at all. Just like that. Are you a nurse? Well, I like calling myself carer. But people like calling me nurse. So... So, when I started feeling awful, I never expected this would get ugly, that it would get serious, and... Paths are inscrutable. I'm truly sorry. Don't worry, I'm fine. I've come to terms with it. I just want to get to Valgarde to see my dad. He made my mum suffer so much, and I can't understand that. I hope I'll see forgiveness there. Damn. Picture it... Plucking up the courage. - Does he know you're coming? - No. Not at all. No, he left when I was little. And... we never heard of him again. Lazy prick. I want to see his face because... I look just like my mum when she was my age. - You're going to see your ex, right? - Yes. Do you get along? Yes. Well, it's cordial. I don't have your courage to forgive. Especially when he's left an everlasting mark on our daughter. In the face of something so sacred as that bull, you must cross yourself. Whether people like it or not, it is, it was and it will continue to be a symbol of Spanish culture. We have to show respect. Come on, do it. Or else it's bad luck, child. It's bad luck for the poor animal that comes into this world to be tortured. Not the same old story. Oh my God. Look! Look who's come back to prove me right. She was five and he... He had too much alcohol in his system to drive. But it could have been worse. She survived, despite the burns. After the accident, they thought she'd never walk again, and look. Kids are cut from a different cloth. They're tougher than their parents. No, not all kids. Your girl. You can tell she's resilient. - And I'm too overprotective, right? - No, I never said that. But it's true. Kids are cruel and I can't stand the idea of her getting hurt. Yet here I am, separating her from her world to go to work to London. There's nothing wrong in that. It's your right. It's ten months. And it's a good opportunity for me. - Of course. For her too, because she'll see her dad. Ultimately, your daughter and I are going for the same reason. Cheer up. It's this pasodoble, it brings back memories. Damn, don't tell me you haven't heard this one. What the fuck do they teach you at school? It's one of my favourites. Damn! It's even more famous than Rafa Nadal. Imagine it on an electric guitar. When I play this, it sounds... It sounds like punk, you know? It's amazing. No way. Are you a jack-of-all-trades? Can you play the guitar? - Can I? You must be kidding, child. Jesus. In the 80s I was in a band that was massive. The One-Eyed Living Dead. I sang, played the guitar... I fucking owned the stage, you know? Had you known me back then, you would have fallen for me. All the girls back then fell for me. Oh Lord. - Yes, because now as a chauffeur no one fancies you, to be honest. Fuck... you're such a wind-up-merchant. This is temporary, yeah? Until I get bored of it. I don't get tied down for anything or anyone. I'm a natural survivor. Not this shit again. What now? Hey. What's wrong? Child! Child! Marta! Marta! Madam, something's wrong with her, she's all stiff. Marta! Marta! What's wrong? Marta! Marta, it's me, your mum! Marta! - Marta! - Child! Child! What's wrong? - Careful! Fuck me! Fuck! What was that? - You hit someone! Turn around. - No, what do you mean? - You hit someone, go back! No way! Madam, sort your daughter out! - Marta! Marta, please! Marta! It couldn't have been someone on the road. If you don't go back, it's failure of duty to rescue. Go back! Marta! That's it, darling. Stop the car! Last warning, go back or I'll report you! - Marta, look at me! - For fuck's sake! Wretch! Turn around, you scumbag! - Breathe with me. - Fuck my life! Hurry! I can't see a thing. Use your headlights. I know, I know. Less orders, sergeant. There! There! Damn! What the fuck is this? Fuck my life. Please tell she isn't dead. She's breathing. She has a pulse, but she's freezing. - Is she OK? - Get help, please! - I'm calling for help. - What was she doing walking on the middle of the road at this time? Fuck! What? What was that? Please, you call. - Want me to call? - Please call, yes! I'll call. But you've all witnessed it. It was an accident. It wasn't my fault. OK? It wasn't me. OK. Bloody hell! Fucking shitty technology! - Do you have bandages? - What? - Do you have bandages, yes or no? - Yes. - Fetch them! - Hurry! Fuck... Can you hear me? She doesn't understand. She looks foreign. - Come on! - Coming! Fuck my life. Take. There you go. - We have to take her to the hospital. - No way. No fucking way. She won't die in Nessa. - What are you on about? - What I'm on about? You can't move someone who's been hit. Everyone says that. We'll go ahead and look for help. You're heartless. Heartless? We'll fuck up if we move her. - Shut up already! - Eh? Please! I need help, come here. You too. She's a nurse. We're in good hands. - A nurse? - Listen to me! Let's move her, but keep her straight. On the count of three, lift. Keep her straight, OK? One, two, three! There's a first-aid post 30 kilometres from here! Take the next exit! - There's a hospital in Valgarde! - What? - What's your name? I don't know that road, madam! And those maps are old as fuck. I'm sure that post is no longer there. She's not well, we have to take the risk! My car, my rules! What are you doing? I'm going to the hospital, which is where she belongs. That's what I'm doing. First, you didn't want to turn around. And now you fail to get help. Can you tell me what kind of monster are you? Poor thing. If you say so, madam. You made it perfectly clear before. A scumbag with no heart. A caveman. - Yes, that's what you are. - This fucking witch must be right then. - Hey! Listen to me, you think I have no heart? - No. - Who fucking has one? Do you have one? Poor thing... This is the shitty world we live in, where some strangers have to share a ride because we're poor as fuck! Where everything is in fucking shambles! Speak for yourself. I can't take it anymore, madam! I can't take it! Just look behind you. And I still can't understand why the woman I've loved the most left me after giving birth to my stillborn son. You need to seek professional help. The sooner, the better. You can't justify your chauvinist and backward behaviour! You can't justify it all the time! You can't! I just want to get to the hospital and not be blamed for anything. That's all I want. Are you done? Or do you need tissues for your tears? I have one right here. - Mum, shut up! - Marta! - Leave him alone, you don't know him! Marta, enough! I won't let you speak to me like that. Marta! Marta! Turn the volume down! Enough! Turn the music down, Marta! Marta! I'm getting some signal. I'll call for help! How are you doing back there, Mariela? Do you want to know how I actually lost my eye? Yes. We had no clue that the pricks from the village next to ours came with slingshots. Mum! Mum! We have to help her! Come on! Come on! Mum! - What the fuck is that? - Mum! Mum! Mum! Die, you son of a bitch! Run, run! Run, run, get your daughter. Come here, run, get your daughter. Run! - Run, Marta. - Run! Will it hold? Nessa is strong, but I wouldn't stay to test that. Fuck! Let's get out of here. To hell with that fucking mariachi. Can you believe what she did to Nessa? My Nessa! That wasn't Mariela. She has cancer. - Huh? Perhaps the thing inside her won't survive the disease. We have to split up. That's best, we have to split up, OK? In case this shit can multiply, you know? OK? No, Blasco, don't leave us. - Relax, kiddo. Relax. Trust me, OK? This is best for you both. Besides, I smashed its head with my guitar and said all the crap about women; it'll go after me. Go on. You're right, we have to split up. Of course. Blasco is always right. Go on. Hey, you. Here, just in case. Not so bad, huh? - Let's go. - Hey. Let's go. - It hurts. - Is it your finger? Let me see. Come on. What's wrong, dear? Get it off me, get it off me. Get it off me. Get it off me! Get it off me! My child. Hold on, love. Hold on. Hold on, please. Marta. Marta. Mum. Mum, Mum, hurry. We have to go. Mum. We have to split up. What the hell? If we stick together, it will eventually catch up. Seek a road, find someone, I'll stay here, I'll keep it distracted. - No! I want to stay with you. What I said before wasn't true. Don't leave me alone. I love you so much. I know, dear, I love you too. That's why I need you to listen to me, dear, for us to survive. - No! Promise you'll make it out. I'll do my best to make it out. Please, hurry. - No. - Seek a road, go, please. - No! Mum! That hurt. That hurt. Do you have a plaster? I smashed my skull in. Where's your mum? - Blasco! - It's OK. Kiddo, what's wrong? Hey, relax. Let's move. - Run. - Let's go. - Run. Run. Run, let's go. Come on, go. Run. - Mum... - Let's leave! Let's get out of here. - No, no. - It's too late. We can't do anything. Your mum knew she wouldn't make it out. Understand that, please. This is fucked up, let's go! Let's leave now! No, let me go. You're clueless. Leave me alone. Leave! Please, child. I'm begging you, get in! Child! Fuck, fuck! What happened to your finger? It gets inside you. What does? That thing does. It gets inside your body to live inside you like a... I don't know. Like a parasite? Is that what you mean? A parasite. Fuck, I have absolutely no doubt then. What we saw back there was a UFO. Fucking invaders that want to take over our bodies and minds to control us. You're absolutely right, just like in films! That's what happened, that fucking creature got inside the Mexican lady's body and ate her guts... Shut up, Blasco. Don't cry, don't cry, kiddo. Everything will be OK. Trust me. Fuck, cry then. If that relieves you, that'll do good. Cry your eyes out. You know what? Your mum is the bravest person I've ever met. That's right. You would've done the same if I were your daughter. I wouldn't be so sure about that. You saw how I fled. But you came back. Right, because it was going to fuck up Nessa. And you didn't leave me behind. All right then, I kind of agree. That doesn't take away credit from what your mum did. Can you put some music on? I've lost my phone. As you wish, boss. All right, Nessa, come on. Come on, Nessa, hold on. Hold on just a bit longer. Hey, quit that. I see you with my good eye. I know what you're thinking, but this place is empty, as you can see. We're going straight to the petrol station, Nessa needs fuel. - We need to get help. - Right, but trust me. I know the manager, he's a nice guy. Besides, I always stop there when my passengers need to pee. Will he call the police? Police...? The Spanish Legion, with their goat and all. We have to get rid of that creature, fuck, at all costs. Blasco, what's that smell? It smells like piss. Like piss? It must be this crap on the screen, I guess. Look, child! There it is, come on! Fuck, what Blasco says, goes. Nessa. Blasco? Fuck, Nessa. Fuck. Blasco, what's wrong? Blasco. - What? - We're going backwards. BLASCO PEST CONTROL Fuck my life. Come on, child. Push. Nessa is so fucking heavy. Come on, nearly. Come on, child, go. Now, all the way up. You should quit smoking and join a gym. I've joined one, now all I have to do is go. Damn. Damn, Nessa, don't tell me you're on your period again. I thought you were menopausal. - What did you say? - Nothing, nothing at all, child. This isn't an issue, it's nothing serious. Relax, I can patch this up. Bloody hell. No fucking way. BACK IN 5 For fuck's sake. - What is it? He's not here. - But he's back in five minutes, yeah? - Five minutes, my ass. I know this guy. And nobody's ever on this road. Hey, look at me, relax. Relax. Hey, Marta, look at me. Look at me. Breathe. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath, slowly, that's is. Again. I'm not going anywhere. I'm here with you and I'm not leaving you, OK? OK? - OK. - You believe me, yeah? - Yeah. Come here, my princess. Blasco has a plan. Let me see, my child. The fifth passenger has caused such a mess, Nessa. No shit. As I mentioned, I'll get petrol from the village, OK? Well, my child, I'm leaving. Be quiet and lock the doors. Don't open it for anyone, not even for your singer friend, the one from Cuenca, Diazepam...? - Dua Lipa. Whatever. - What if Máximo returns? - If Maxi returns, he knows Nessa. He'll come and say hi, for sure. Tell him what's going on. To him to fill her up and find somewhere safe to hide until I get back, OK? - OK. Anyway, lock the doors, lights off and be quiet. Great. - Blasco. - Yes? Will you come back? I'd never abandon my two favourite girls. All right, take care of my girl. OK. I was talking to Nessa. You're such a pain. Hi, madam. I'm back. I'm sorry. What is it, little thing? Come here, come to daddy. What is it, my little thing? Where are you going? What? Fuck! Child. Come here, come. What's wrong? - What happened? - It was here. It was here. - What was here? - My mum. Marta, what do you mean? We have to leave. Blasco, we have to leave at once. Come on, hurry. Hurry, run! Come on, let's go! Fucking hell. What now? Nothing. And where... where did you get petrol from? The village. I took some out of a car. What's your band called? What? The heavy metal one, what was it called? What's this fucking interrogation about? Answer! Firstly, it wasn't heavy metal, it was kalimotxero rock, which is quite different. It was the One-Eyed Living Dead. There's a sticker there. ONE-EYED LIVING DEAD Is that enough? Any more questions? Are you convinced I have no fucking parasite inside me? Fuck. I'm sorry. Oh, you did... You did amazing, child. Fucking amazing. We don't even know what that is. We don't know if there are more. I'm fucking thirsty. - Let me see, come here, let me plug your wound. Are you a nurse now? - Take your hat off, please. - I'm not sure... Let me see... All done. Thank goodness you have a big head. Excuse me? A chauvinist, a caveman... - And A big head. And a big head. Fuck. As if we didn't have enough! When it rains, it pours. Go on, dry up, Nessa. No. - It's here! - It's here. No! Hold on. Fuck, hold on. Let go, it's OK. OK, let's go. I have you now, whore. Hold tight! Take that! It's over, my child. It's over. It's all over, OK? Are you OK? Have you heard this one? Of course. It's Pepito el Chocolatero, right? What's so funny? It's Paquito, Paquito el Chocolatero. Pepito is Dua Lipa's cousin, you know, the one from Cuenca. My head's killing me and I'm so thirsty. Blasco, Blasco, what's wrong? Nothing, relax. It might be a good idea to have a safe word. Just in case. In case we split up. What about... "pasodoble"? That's getting old. You're so tiresome! I'm 100 % Blasco, without a question. - Blasco, what's wrong? - I feel dizzy, do you have water? I think Mariela had some in the back. - I need water. - We have none. Blasco. Blasco. Blasco. Blasco! Wake up. What's wrong? Your mum. Your mum's back. Blasco! Blasco! Blasco! Blasco! Blasco! Blasco! Let him go! Let him go! No, no! No, Blasco, no! Blasco. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Ready! It's OK. Drink. Are you OK? Mum? Mum? It's me, it's me. Mum, I'm your daughter. It's... it's me. No, no, no! Blasco! Marta! Blasco, it won't hold! Hold on, Nessa, hold on. Fuck me! No! No! Marta! Marta! Hold on, Marta! We have to do it, Nessa. We have to save her at all costs. You've been fucking amazing, as usual. For the last time, it's been a pleasure. I'll drive you again on Hell's motorways. No! Hold on, child! Marta! Child! Child! Marta. Marta! Marta. Marta! Marta. Marta. Marta. Marta. Child? Marta! Marta. Marta? Fuck, come here. Come, come, that's it. Come here. "Pasodoble." Fuck, you scared the shit out of me. Let's get you out. Come, get out. That's it. Slowly, slowly. There we go. Up we go. How are you? Tell me, are you OK? At least I didn't get burnt this time. Come here. Look at what this hag did to Nessa. Oh, let's go. - Blasco. - What? I hope you're not expecting a five-star rating on this trip. What a jackass... Let's go. No, no! No, no! Hey, you! Stop chewing her ear and come after me, if you have the ovaries. Hey! Hey, you beast! Hey! Come on. Come on, let's go. In the end, this sword came in handy. Come on, let's go. Come on. Would you grant me this dance? I can't think of a better way to say goodbye to Nessa. With this music? Close your eyes. Just go with the flow. This music has more passion than all reggaeton combined. VISTA ALEGRE RESTAURANT - Blasco. - Yes? What if that thing came in an intergalactic ChatChat-Car and they crashed here? No, child, they came to extinguish cavemen like me. That was much needed. Wow... Entering Vista Alegre with a bullfighter's standing ovation. What ovation? Hello? Hey! Anyone here? Fuck. You know what? I came here to drink, and as I'm a Blasco, I'll drink. Well, I'll... go to the WC. This is an actual happy ending. Cheers! THE PASSENGER Translation: M. Mitha Subtitles: Bbo Subtitulado
