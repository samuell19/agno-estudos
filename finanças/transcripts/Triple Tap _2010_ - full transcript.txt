Clinching second place is no small feat... for someone who has just been in the game for a year. It looks like we'll be rivals from now on. Rivals can be friends too. Of course! See you at the finals. Mr Fong, which route are we using today? Tsing Yi South Bay Tunnel and across the bridge to the airport? Hell, we'll be circling the whole town. I have to pick my kid up from school. Mr Kwan. - What is it? - Some members disobeyed the rules... and didn't separate the guns from the bullets. The manager told me to watch out for it. That's a load of work. Just put up a warning notice. That's what I said. The bullets are here. Okay. Where's the gun going? Kowloon Gun Club. I forgot to congratulate you for clinching the first place. Where will you be celebrating? After I return the gun, I'll be working overtime. The financial crisis isn't over yet. Thanks. Doug, the car behind seems to be tailing us. - It's gone. - You're paranoid. Do you think this road belongs to you? There has been a serious accident on Highway Eight, Tsing Yi section. All units in Kowloon West, respond to the scene immediately. Repeat... There has been a serious accident on Highway Eight, Tsing Yi section. All units in Kowloon West, respond to the scene immediately. Billy, escort the ambulance to Princess Margaret Hospital. - Be quick! - Yes, sir! Move it! Open the door! Open the door! Hey, don't move! Grab him! You're the traitor! You're crazy! Let me go! Hello? Emergency Dispatch. Hello? Hello? Calm down. Speak slowly. An armoured truck is being robbed! Captain, an armoured truck is being robbed. Searching location now. You listen up! I've called the police! The cops are on the way! Mobile signal located on Highway Eight near the South Bay Tunnel. Give me the screen of South Bay Tunnel. The surveillance system of that area is under repair for the day. This is Dispatch Centre calling all Kowloon West patrol officers. There's a robbery of an armoured truck on Highway Eight. Any patrol nearby? Captain, I have all the patrols here. Is there anybody near Highway Eight? Any patrol nearby? Dispatch... patrol officer 20011 on the way to the crime scene! Put it out! Hurry! - The back door! - Stand still! Don't shoot! I'm with you! - Don't move! - I'm with you! Don't shoot! Take it easy! - Where's the stuff? - Inside the briefcase. Go get it! - Go! - Wait... - What about me? - What about you? They know I'm involved. I'm finished! Who would scream "I'm with you" at the robbers? If they rat on me, you can't get away either! Hey! Don't run! Let me do it! Don't move! Get back! - What are you doing? - Don't shoot! Don't! Just go! I'll take care of things here! - Go! - You'll take care of things here? I'll take care of you! Not this one! You can't kill him! He knows you. If the cops find him, they'll find you. If they find you, they'll find us. No. You can't keep this one. He's my friend. We have to kill him even if he's your father! Toa! Don't let them kill me... No! Listen to me! - Let go! - Freeze! Drop your gun! Hey! Freeze! - Officer, I've nothing to do with this! - All of you! Don't move! I need ammunition! Wait! - Any more? - None! - Cover me! - Go! Harry! Emergency dispatch? My surname is Kwan. I just witnessed an armoured truck being robbed. It's at the exit of South Bay Tunnel, west bound lane. The armoured truck was robbed by three men. They shot the security guards and another man... before a traffic cop came and got shot too. I just finished a shooting competition. That's why I have a gun. In order to save the cop, I shot the three robbers. Another man escaped. Call for an ambulance quickly! - I called the police. - Get down! Turn around and get down! Don't move! The traffic cop isn't dead! The traffic cop isn't dead yet! What are you doing? Stop! Billy, hang in there! Move back! Clear out! Don't block the way! - What about his family? - They've been notified. They should be here soon. Ting, I saw your boyfriend in the ER. Sir, it's him. - Can I help you? - This is a routine police enquiry. - It won't take too long. - It's you? I saw the robbery. I'm a CID inspector. I'm in charge of this case. Why did you shoot them? The robbers killed the security guards... and were about to kill the traffic officer. Any other injuries? - Remove the handcuffs. - What? I was just with him at a competition. We'll talk at the police station. The doctor is here. The traffic officer is Billy Tsui. - Billy the twin? - You know him? I know his brother, a sniper from Hit Team. His whole family are in the police force. His condition is critical. The bullet penetrated the helmet and entered his left brain. I have to operate on him now. Be careful, madam. - Mum, let her sit down first. - Madam, don't worry. Mum, don't worry. It'll be okay. Warren. Warren, he's the one who shot the robbers. Wait a minute! Are you the one who shot and killed the robbers? I'm his brother, Warren. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. I should have fired sooner. Let me summarise this case. Bergman Brothers is a non-public investment bank. Their private armoured truck... carrying bearer bonds that were to be shipped to Berlin was robbed. There are seven fatalities... including three security guards, a bank manager... and three suspects with no ID on them. Traffic officer Billy Tsui was shot and is now in a coma. Our only witness Ken Kwan is giving a statement now. He said one suspect had fled. We'll have a composite drawing. Alan, take teams A and B and check everyone's background. Yes, sir. Logan, lead teams C and D. Follow up on all the evidence. Yes, sir. I prepared a checklist for everyone. No need for details yet. Sir... No questions for now. This is just another case of robbery. Don't panic because of the body count. Be patient. Get sufficient evidence. Build a solid case. We'll have a meeting at eight tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. - Did he look like this? - Yes. Okay. This is from the traffic department. Eat it while it's hot. You were born in Hong Kong in 1975. Your father passed away early. You completed primary and secondary education in government schools. You scored distinctions in the public examination in 1992. You obtained a psychology degree at the Hong Kong University... then studied economics in the US. That makes it easier to get a job, right? You were recruited by a head hunter in 2003. You returned to Hong Kong and joined an investment company. You became a team leader in just three years. Your annual bonus alone was over HK$3 million last year. You own two properties in Hong Kong. You bought your mum and sister a house in Vancouver two years ago. Your driving skills are not bad either. You didn't get one single traffic ticket all these years. You must be a cautious man. By the way, I need your advice. There was a girl who saw a boy at her father's funeral. It was love at first sight. A month later, the girl's sister was murdered. The murderer turned out to be the girl. So why did she kill her sister? She wanted another funeral so that she could see the boy again. That's why she killed her sister. For the sake of seeing that person, was it worth it? She had an obsessive nature and an inferior complex. She acted only according to her instinct. She had no choice. I never studied psychology, but I'm quite interested in it. I read a lot on this subject. If I'm a suspect, shouldn't I have a lawyer present... before I answer any more questions? You're the only witness. I have to detain you for further questioning. Go ahead and eat. The food here is lousy. We work here so have no choice but to put up with it. Everything's poisonous nowadays. There's no choice anyway. Whether or not we have choices has nothing to do with the world. It's all about ourselves. Looks like you've read the book. Martin Goodman's "Criminals And Their Motivations." According to his research... over 80% of criminals felt they had no choice. I'd better read up more before I talk to you again. "Criminals And Their Motivations" "Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance" "Financial Prodigy Heroically Rescues Traffic Police Officer." All right, everyone! Time for a meeting! Draw the shades, please. Let's start. We found no identification documents on any of the suspects. They're probably not local. We've passed their prints and photos to the other departments and Interpol. Security guards Doug Wong, Jim Lee and Joe Shing... have all been found to have a clean background. However, Fong, the manager... just lost over HK$6 million in the stock market. We're looking into that. Serial numbers on the guns were all destroyed. The barrels were purposely scratched too. We can't retrieve any record. This gun was put together with parts that can be bought easily. So it's untraceable. Parts can be bought easily? What does that mean? Amateur gun enthusiasts are really professional nowadays. Many of the parts are actually used on real guns. You can buy these in any toy stores in town. Is that legal? Springs, screws and triggers. How are these illegal? If you can't buy them, you can make them yourself. We found a cell phone on one of the suspects. The pre-paid card was bought from the streets. I checked the call history. There was only one outgoing call. After the robbery, the number hasn't been used. The route map was sealed in this envelope. The manager was given this before the journey. He was to open it when he got inside the armoured truck. In other words, no one was supposed to know the route beforehand. The truck didn't follow the route. It must be an inside job. Remember, the deceased are just leads. The important thing now is to find him. This is a sample of the bearer bonds that are missing. They were valued at US$400 million. Wow, US$400 million. Don't get any ideas. If Suspect X has the bonds, he'll convert them to cash. Hei, contact the Commercial Crime Bureau. Find out who might be interested. Yes, sir. - What about him? - He's clean. Shall we release him, sir? Charge him with murder and possession of firearms. Charge him? Anything wrong? Sir, he saved one of our own. Tell me. Which law permits him to kill? Section 101, Citizen's Arrest. Any person may arrest without warrant... any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence. And also section 101A. A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances... in the prevention of crime. You need to get one thing straight. He has the right to make an arrest, but no right to open fire. But, sir, have you considered the public reaction? The media labelled him as a hero. If we charge him, we'll get the flak. But it'll be worse if we don't charge him. The boss has decided. We'll leave this to the court. We'll let the jury decide. Sir, what are we going to tell the traffic department? If there's any fuss, tell them to go to the prosecutor. Well, we'd better not drive tomorrow. The traffic guys will do what they can to give us a ticket. I can't believe this. I read the book again last night. Even Martin Goodman can't find a motive for your crime. I believe you're not involved... but you broke the firearms legislation and took lives. I was saving someone. It's not up to me to decide if you took a life or save one. Am I in serious trouble? Very much so. You'd better bring a good lawyer to court tomorrow. How is it going? We'll approach the judge tomorrow. We'll volunteer bail of a sizeable amount. - How much? - HK$10 million. Okay, let the solicitors know. Money's no problem. I've told them. One more thing. We need a couple of high profile guarantors. - I'll take care of it. - All right, keep in touch. - Bye. - Miss Shaw, this is a tricky case. He's not going to get off that easily. What about his accounts? - Are you eyeing to take over his accounts? - That's not what I meant. We have a fully automated system. Trading only proceeds if the prices are marked and locked in. I don't see a problem. I'm just saying, what if his client calls... If his client calls, just say I'm in charge. - Do you understand? - Yes. Why are you still here then? Ken Kwan, who was charged with murder and the illegal use of firearms... was in court today. The defendant put up a record-breaking bail of HK$10 million... and with the support of seven elite guarantors behind him... he was released. His guarantors include Kevin Leung, the vice-chairman of Bolton Bank... Anna Shaw, president of Universal Investment Group... Are you all right? Thanks. Close the curtains. Did you just thank me? You must be hungry. What would you like? I just want to sleep. You can't go back just yet. Ming, drive us around Repulse Bay before we head home. Stepping over these swords will rid you of bad luck. When did you become superstitious? I'm just getting old, I guess. When you realise you can't beat the odds, you'll become superstitious. You lost a lot? I was so worried about you... I didn't have the time to monitor the team. They bought in euros and lost a lot. Tomorrow morning... I'll have some explaining to do at the headquarters in London. I told Susan to book a ticket for you as well. I have nothing on after Wednesday. It'll be just you and I. I can't leave town. Stay with me tonight then. I missed you. Don't you have anything to ask me? Is it necessary? Go take a shower. And dump these clothes you're wearing. Mr Kwan. Don't disturb her. The doctor says he's stable. We had a patient who woke up after being in a coma for two years. So don't worry. If there are any changes, let me know. Mr Kwan, how long have you been shooting? Five years. Why are you so interested in this sport? It has similar characteristics to my work. It requires complete focus and precision. Why don't you choose golf? Golf is the same. Like soccer or swimming, it's a matter of personal preference. Do you have violent tendencies? - No, I don't. - No? Then why did you treat the suspects like targets... and fired multiple shots at each of them? Your Honour. There are 2,286 citizens with gun licences in Hong Kong. Is the prosecutor assuming that all of them have violent tendencies? I can answer that. I did it out of reflex. In combat shooting, multiple shots are often fired. The purpose is to guarantee a hit. So you shot a man, thinking you were in a competition? No. Although I'm not in the military... my training is quite similar. Multiple shots undermine the opponent's ability to return fire. Special Forces are trained that way. Could you tell me if your feelings are the same... when shooting a target and shooting at a man? Your Honour! Mr Chan, I don't see the point of your question. I'll ask another question, Your Honour. Do you realise that a gun can kill? Yes, and so can a golf club. Have you ever fantasised about killing someone? Yes. Have you ever fantasised about firing at a living, breathing human? Yes. Can you describe this fantasy of yours? I think most people have come across images of killings from a young age... from the movies and the news. I've imagined what it'd be like to open fire at a living person. But after experiencing combative shooting... after handling a gun, realising its destructive power and the danger behind it... these thoughts never surfaced again. A person's interests can reflect his character and personality. Do you agree? I know you studied psychology. I'm sure you can answer that. Yes, I agree. Do you know that... shooting at human-shaped targets over long periods of time... increases one's subconscious tendency to kill? I know. That's why in order to reduce public misconceptions... and to gain entry to the Olympics... the association no longer uses the human-shaped targets. Mr Chan, could you please be more direct with your questions? Yes, Your Honour. Are you familiar with the Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance? Absolutely. Do you know that unless at the gun club or a competition venue... you have absolutely no right to use any firearms? - I do, but at that moment... - A simple answer will do. Your Honour, the defendant has the right to elaborate. You may continue. While I was in custody, I couldn't sleep. I kept asking myself if I did the right thing. I kept wondering why I didn't turn the car around and leave. I knew I'd be in trouble if I fired, so why did I still choose to do it? Finally, I stopped blaming myself. I know that if I didn't open fire... the traffic police would have been killed. My intention was to save a life. I have absolutely no regrets. If it were to happen again, I believe I'd do the same thing. Your Honour, the prosecutor clearly tried to establish the defendant... as a crazed killer who wanted to try killing people... after practising competitive shooting for some time. He needn't go to the trouble... of using an arsenal of jargon to defame my client. There is no doubt that my client has broken the law governing firearms. However, let me remind everyone... the intent and purpose behind our legislation. Our laws are drawn up to safeguard human lives and properties. The legislation isn't just words. If we overlook the fact that the law is for the people... then the legislation would lose its fundamental significance. I want you to think about this. If we see a traffic officer about to be killed by criminals... would we want to save him? I believe the majority of us would. But do we have the courage to do so? I can honestly say that most of us don't. My client did kill someone. But no one can deny the fact that he had the extraordinary courage... to do what anyone with a sense of decency would do. What threatens to bring him down today is not his lack of morals... but the legislation governing the use of firearms. I would like to remind everyone... that such acts are legal in many other countries. There wouldn't even be grounds for prosecution. If he had used his fists or a stick to save that traffic officer that day... he wouldn't be in this predicament today. If legislation prevents us from saving a dying police officer... wouldn't that be ridiculous? Your Honour, a case like this has no precedence. The outcome of this case will set a template for future justice. I hereby urge you members of the jury... to find my client not guilty. This case has generated a lot of controversy. We have Professor Lau here to help us analyse this case. Professor Lau, the jury has been deliberating for six hours. What's your view on this? It'd be very hard for the jury not to be influenced by all the media coverage. I'm sure this is a tug of war between logic and emotion. I believe that the judge will be reminding them... that they have to abide by the law. Rise. Jury, do you have a unanimous verdict? We unanimously find... the defendant not guilty on the charges of illegal use of firearms... and three counts of murder. This court finds the defendant not guilty. He shall be released. The court thanks the jurors for their time on this case. Take care. Congratulations, Mr Kwan. See you at the game. Let's go, Mr Kwan. Before the reporters come. Can you talk to us, please? Can you tell us how you feel now? Mr Kwan, can you give a few comments? What's your opinion on the verdict, Professor Lau? This verdict is totally unacceptable. The judge failed to advise the jury on their duties. I believe that the government will confer with the prosecutor and file an appeal. If there's an appeal, how will you handle the situation? Sorry, we have no comment. What's this? You're playing hooky. I'm on holiday. Holiday? Why aren't you partying? If I wanted to party, I wouldn't have asked to be transferred here. Any fish here? Plenty. There are rabbitfish, yellow-finned bream and even squid at night. Hey. You look tired. I couldn't sleep. Is it a really tough case? There are no more leads. So now you've come to me? Come on, give me a break. I came for a visit and some fresh air. That's all. It's a new book. Psychology? I haven't read this stuff in ages. Really? I heard you broke my record. Same points, but I was 0.6 seconds faster than you. But I lost by 0.31 at the end. That means I lost by a whole second? Well, never mind. I held that record for so many years. It's about time. He was lucky. He shot a triple tap at the end. Do you think you're playing golf? A hole in one is pure luck. A triple tap has nothing to do with luck. It's about instinct. Like in the movies, man and weapon becomes one? Developing skills requires constant practice. After you achieve absolute confidence... instinct will allow you to make the move with no hesitation. Wow, that's Zen! You'll understand when you get to that level. Are you for real? Did you make that up? Do you really want to beat him? How do you know that? Don't be that desperate. It's pointless. In a real gunfight, half a second or so means nothing. Someone will get shot in the end anyway. Are you sure he's clean? Who? The guy who beat us. Why would he be? There's nothing suspicious, and he has no plausible motives. He's loaded too. Billionaires are loaded too. I don't see them retiring. I'm sure he's clean. So? What's the suspect's mindset? I was just taking in some fresh air. Sir, I just sliced it up. It's really fresh today. I'm cutting another one inside. I'll get it for you. There are two of us here. Get another pair of chopsticks. Okay. Tell me. If I assume there are no fish here... how could I be eating sashimi? Delicious! Ladies and gentlemen, each year, Asia Investors Association... presents an award to one of our colleagues... for the best judgment, creativity and overall performance. Tonight, the recipient is very special. Not only is this his second time winning this award... he's the four-time champion of the HKPSC competition. Let us give a warm welcome to our Best Foreign Funding Manager... our marksman, Mr Ken Kwan! We also invite our chairman up on stage to present this award. Actually, life doesn't give us enough time... to think and be analytical. Whether it's investing or saving a life... when the timing is right, one has to make a move without hesitation. I'd like to thank the judges, all my colleagues at the office... and my boss, Miss Anna Shaw. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations! - Congratulations, Anna. - Thank you. Congratulations. Everyone knows you're the one pulling the strings behind the scene. You should thank me for picking up the award for you. Can we leave now? Don't be childish. All the people here can help you in many ways. Miss Shaw, I haven't seen you in a while. Hi, it's been a long time. Congratulations, Mr Kwan. After the financial crisis, there's still a lot of money out there. Russian financial oligarchs don't want their money locked in Europe. They've been shifting over here. As long as it's not dirty money. Mr Ko, was there a lot of money laundering back in the day? Of course. In the old days, once the winning lottery number was announced... the police inspectors would offer big bucks to buy the winning ticket. They'd claim the winnings and voila, the money is clean. It got even more convenient with the advent of gambling ships. They'd bring the ship out to open sea and play a couple of rounds. Who would know where the money came from? What sort of clientele do you see on the gambling ships? Shady folks guilty of tax evasion and corruption. Back then, the service charge was a whopping 30%. The government tightened the laws... and service charges skyrocketed. I heard that a trip out on the gambling ships these days... leaves you with 30% of your original loot. What? The ships takes 70%? I'll do it. You don't want to joke about that. If the Monetary Authority hears you, you'll be arrested. Anna. Give me a figure. I must have this guy. I'll give you three years' salary in advance. Start work at my office tomorrow. Joyce, he's mine and you'll never have him. In this city, everyone has a price tag. Tell me how much you want. Who is this? Is she your friend? Not really. Excuse me. You can't complain. Every game comes with its risks. Of course you can say that. You've earned enough. That's true. Mr Kwan. Congratulations. Congratulations. Good job. Keep up the good work next year. By the way, CY's coming back soon. He'll call you. Want to come up? I'd like to be alone. Have you broke up with her? No. I know how hurting it can be. Handle it carefully. You know how I feel about you. As long as you love me... you'll always have me as an ally, no matter what. And I'm sure I can be of help to you. You know what I mean, right? Ken? I'm wondering when to resign. I left my phone in the car. I'll go get it. I'm not calling her. What's the matter? What's going on? Stop there! Stop running! He's dangerous! Leave him be! Freeze! Stop running! Freeze! It's okay, we're the police. I guess he's the guy that got away. You killed his buddies, so he's out for revenge. The paper mentioned your name and where you work. It's not that hard to track you down. How long has it been? I guess he started stalking you right after you got out. I meant your men. You're a tax payer. We have to offer you some service. You're using me as bait? I just want my normal life back. Can you let me off? One word from me, my men will pack up and leave. It's really simple. But the suspect won't let you off so easily. He's already under a lot of pressure. Don't put a tail on him. Look, he saved one of our men. We don't want anything to happen to him. Haven't I seen you at the trial? And the hospital too. Just take it that my men are here to keep your girlfriend safe. My men will be discreet. They won't interfere with your life. Call me anytime if you need me. Hey, where is he? Let's check over there. Is it necessary to do this in front of all these people? - What is this about? - Mr Ko, we'll talk at the police station. Don't be angry. Hello. Universal Investment. Mr Kwan. You're looking for me? I need your advice. Got a moment to spare? Of course. You know the bearer bonds that went missing? I'd like to know how it works. - I wouldn't know. - You don't? In our business, we have stocks, bonds, commodities and foreign exchange. They're all different. Oh, you mean it's like how surgeons specialise in different fields? So what do you do? It's hard for an amateur to grasp. Come on in. Outline it for me, I'll try to get it. My clients will leave their money with me. I'll invest it for them. I'm in foreign exchange. Do you take a commission from the profit? We charge a fee first. Wow, that's better than running a casino. You guys are like legal professional gamblers. You can't say that. Our company has many financial specialists... who use the most sophisticated software to analyse the market. - It's more professional. - Is profit guaranteed? It's not stipulated in the contract. But I haven't lost an investment since 2002. I'd better make some investments myself. You need a minimum of US$1 million to make an investment over the counter. How about inside? US$30 million on my side. US$100 million for VIPs upstairs. Heavens! Here's some information on the bearer bonds. Actually, you can find out as much online. Have you had too much coffee or...? It's the shooting. I saw a psychiatrist. I took prescription drugs, but I still can't sleep. I was just trying to survive. For the sake of survival, sometimes... you end up hurting someone else unintentionally. By the way... this guy worked here when you joined the company. Do you remember him? Anything wrong? Miss Shaw, I've read your interviews in the economic pages. He asked me if I knew this man. Our company has over seven hundred employees working on three floors... twenty-four hours a day, and a large turnover of staff. Some employees have never even met their peers. Are you here to investigate a case? Actually, no. I'm finished with Mr Kwan here. The next time I see him would be at the competition next year. I'm not letting him pick up a gun ever again. You're not signing up for it? You're not backing out, are you? It's the World Championships in South Africa. I hope you'll reconsider. I've already signed up. He will not be competing again. Do you understand what I'm saying? Thank you. He's after something. Be careful. What could he be after? It's just my intuition talking. What about you? What are you after? Me? Why are you so insistent on letting the world know I belong to you? What's wrong with that? Why are you so bothered by it? Mr Kwan, it's been a long time. Oh, yes. You were in quite a bit of trouble recently. Where's your boss? He's not in. Did he mention when he's coming back? He did call, but he said he wouldn't be back for a while. Between you and me, he's been acting strangely. He's been mumbling to himself all the time. Saying something like, "You want me dead?" "I'll get my revenge, or I'm not a man!" I think he has lost his marbles. Hey, if you see him, tell him to get back here soon. The landlord's going to shut us down if we don't pay the rent. Park behind there. You're lucky. I thought they'd revoke your license. I know of a former champion called Jim Mew. He was a cop. He killed his predecessor who was a mental case... and managed to get past the trauma. But after he shot and killed another scumbag... he couldn't pick up his gun again. Give it a try. If you can't, don't force yourself. You can't pull the trigger? You've shot and killed men. Why bother with paper targets? Shoot me instead. Pull the trigger! Friggin' schmuck! How dare you want me dead! Didn't you try to kill me that night? I want to, all right. Not just you, your girlfriend too. Say that again. Say that again! - Toa... - Enough! Save it! I'm here for my money. I'll leave once I get my money. You won't see me ever again! The banker who's supposed to help me got arrested. Just find another banker then! No one's willing to take these bonds. I'm trying to sort things out. You said these bonds are like cash. If that's the case, why doesn't anyone want them? If you think it's that simple, you do it! If I know how, i wouldn't need you! You told me it was worth millions, that's why I went for it. Now you get to play the hero. How about me? I have to go into hiding! Why are you so edgy? No one recognises you. If you need cash, I'll give you some. What's your rush? Give me some more time. I'll get it done. But there's one thing we can't afford to wait. That traffic police might wake up. If he does, he'll spill everything. We'll be done for then. Do it yourself. It's all thanks to you. The cops are following me round the clock. Fine. But I want half of the loot. If you get it done, you can have it all. Cops. Are you making offerings to yourself too? This is the only photo I have. It will have to do. Take it that I'm keeping him company. Hey, who are you? Hey! What are you doing? Get over here! Sir. Inspector, can we talk? I have no comment. Are you sure he's clean? - Who? - The guy who beat us. - Sir. - Where was he at eleven tonight? - At home. - How about in the day? He went to work at eight, had lunch downstairs at one... went to a gun shop in Mongkok, proceeded to the Gun Club at four and... - Yes? - We lost him. We didn't see him leave the Gun Club. We rushed back here after the club closed. He came home at ten. What's wrong? Someone tried to kill the traffic police at the hospital just now. That serious? Come on in. - Check the place. - Yes. "The patient was shot in the chest." "The bullet exited through the left underarm." "Fortunately, there's no major organ damage." "After an emergency operation, the patient's condition is stable." He is one lucky man. How is his family taking it? Don't worry about his family. Worry about yourself. Someone wants him dead. You mean the one who got away? I need your advice again. In your statement, the escaped suspect was wearing a disguise. The traffic police can't identify him. You can't either. Nobody knows who he is. So why did he take the risk and come back? I don't know much about criminal profiling. I'll tell you what. I'll help you do some research and try to uncover his frame of mind. Okay. Thank you. I'd better go. Do you want something to eat? I made some supper. Wow, you can cook too? Just a few basic dishes. You're an all-rounder. Don't say that. It only takes a little effort and patience. I'll try your cooking next time. All right, I'll be off then. Remember to be careful. I will. Upstairs, please. Mr Kong. I'm KC's friend. Did you talk to him about this on the phone? No. That idiot didn't even know his phone was tapped. What do you have? A customer of mine needs to cash some bearer bonds. From the heist? KC said you wouldn't ask the source. It's too hot. You have to keep them for years before you can sell them. It's too risky and too expensive. Holding those bonds is no different from holding a death warrant. 40%. 30% 20% My bottom line is 17.5%. I'll burn them if you don't want them. That's a deal. Let's go. Hey! What's the matter? Why are you sneaking around in a van? Get in. Let me burn some offerings for our buddies. They're your buddies, not mine. What about Fong? We were buddies all these years, you cold-blooded scoundrel! Have some humanity, will you? You've lost so much dough that you've lost your head too! Come and get your money! Come and get your money! I'm not that bad, honestly. Take your girl with you and travel. Get on the plane a few times. You'll come back squeaky clean. The traffic police didn't die. Are you sure about this? You're dumping the rich woman and settling down with the nurse? Do you really think you can live on passion alone? Moron! Do you know the traffic police is still alive? Not still alive. He's barely alive. He could be dying right now. Idiot! Take this cash and get out! I never want to see you again! Do you think I want to see you again? They are in sequence? They couldn't use this cash. So they found an idiot to make the exchange. You're such a fool. I'm so stupid. At least the bonds were easier to hide. Where the hell are we going to keep all these cash? Under the bed. - What? - Under the bed! Spend it a dollar at a time when you go grocery shopping. What if my cleaning lady finds it? What will she do if she sees the money? She'll go... "Sir, there are so much US dollars under your bed. May I borrow some?" What do we do now? We'll burn it. If you don't want it, I do! You can't! They ask for ID at the money changers. Are you going to flash yours? Or do you mean to spend this in the US? The supermarket takes credit cards even for a few dollars. If you carry so much cash on you... the cops will think you're a drug dealer! I have a few hundred grand. I'll give it to you tomorrow. A few hundred grand? What do you take me for, a charity case? We're out in the woods. How are you going to carry all this money? Have you gone crazy? Don't push me! If I turn myself in, let's see who'll get more jail time! If I go down, I'm taking your girlfriends down with me. What are you staring at? Get lost! Now! Why must you make me do this? Why must you make me do this? Mr Kwan. The client is dumping Japanese yen. Miss Shaw called for a meeting. A corpse! Let's get out of here! Sir. We found a body. He was shot in the head. There's a cell phone on the body. There's a number in the contact list... belonging to the cell phone from the crime scene. It's Suspect X. The deceased is Pang Toa. He spent eight years in prison for robbery in 1995. Someone financed his shop, which specialised in converting air guns. There was a burnt cargo van eight hundred metres way from the body. It contained what seemed like ashes of burnt currency notes in it. It's down at the lab right now. Sir. When the prosecutor asked him why he fired two shots into each victim... what was his answer? He said it was reflex. You try it. Begin. Shoot the targets I call. Legs. Hands. Within two seconds, you put two shots into different parts of the body. With his skills, he could have disarmed the victims. Every shot he fired was fatal. He meant to kill them. How could you let yourself be duped? You did suspect him. Why did you dismiss your own suspicions so readily? Why did you shoot? Those robbers killed the security guards. They were about to kill the traffic officer. I was saving a life. If it happens again, I'll do the same thing. Was it because he defeated you in the shooting competition... and you didn't want anyone to say you had a personal vendetta? Maybe you really wanted to beat him... so subconsciously, you didn't want to arrest him? I think you're more concerned about the competition than this case. Sir. I need to know his motives. Would you help me? Shooter, are you ready? Shoot! Hands! Head! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Why did you kill them? I had to kill them all. The traffic officer has to die too. Why did you do it? Did the traffic police recognise you? Did the traffic police know who you were? Why did you kill him? I have to kill the witness. - I must kill the witness. - Why did you do that? I need to kill him because he can recognise me! There's more to it than that. Don't lie to me! Why did you want to kill him? Say it! Because he saw something he shouldn't have seen! - Don't get too close! - Get back! Get back! Get back! - Don't push me! - Sir, it's me... Sir, it's me! This is the only way. Push him until he snaps. That's the only way to make him confess. Mr Kwan, the police are looking for you. We suspect you were involved in the robbery of an armoured truck. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in court. - Take him away. - Let's go. This computer is directly linked to the server from our head office. It contains confidential data of our clients. I request the presence of a lawyer. These two men were his childhood friends. They were involved in the robbery. He resorted to robbery because he had lost a lot of money. You better mind what you say. I will sue you if you tarnish my company's reputation. Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. I know things about him that I'm sure you'll be interested to hear. I'm not interested in anything you have to say. You're not interested? Or do you already know? I know love can blind your eyes to the truth. But surely, you still have your sense of smell. He reeks of blood, can't you tell? Aren't you afraid it might rub off on you? If reputation really matters to you... help us find his motive. I'll wait for your call. You really are an expert. You're calm and careful. And a very good actor to boot. Why are you picking on me? You have to get this straight. I'm a police detective. Are you doing this because I defeated you in the competition? Or because you know you'll never beat me? Why can't I beat you? Because you doubt your own instinct. You won't shoot until the red dot is actually on the target. I'm not in your line of work. I don't take chances. What chances are you taking now? Is this necessary? Let me ask you this. Is it true that you'll get nightmares after taking a life? Are you trying to put the pressure on me? You'd need to read up a lot more. Humans have a conscience. Not everyone would kill in order to survive. Do you have a conscience? If you have proof, you can charge me right away. There's no rush. You can sit here for a while. Sir. Time's up. You can go now. I'm guessing... the mastermind utilised the company's account without permission. But the funds evaporated overnight when the financial crisis hit. He was digging one hole to fill another and it was spiraling out of control. His main concern wasn't the money. He couldn't accept losing his reputation... especially in front of the boss who got him to where he was. Then this opportunity arose. Fong, a buddy who's working for another investment group, came to him... claiming he lost all his money in the stock market. Another buddy Pang Toa wasn't doing too well either. So the three of them came up with this scheme. One worked from the inside. The other did the hit. Such deep friendship. You have no proof that I'm connected to the robbery. You're right. We have no witnesses and no evidence. I have nothing. Martin Goodman's book was useless too. Since you're so interested in psychology... here's my conjecture on what really happened. Pray tell. Actually... the mastermind's only task was to sell the bonds. After the shooting competition that day, he found himself driving to the crime scene. Out of anxiety, perhaps. Or maybe curiosity. It's typical criminal behaviour. Perpetrators often feel the need to be where the action is. When he heard over the radio that there was a traffic accident nearby... he was very concerned. But the chaos delayed the cops from arriving at the location. It did him a favour. - Don't move! - Don't shoot! - I told you not to move! - Don't! Look at me! Calm down! Where's the stuff? Everything was going smoothly. But when the mastermind was about to leave.. he saw the manager who helped them with the inside job... nervously grabbing a robber and yelling. He was afraid the cops would show up, so he got out of the car... forgetting that the three other robbers had no clue who he was. - Toa! - Watch it! - No! He's the boss! - Shut up! Just get out of here! I can't leave! They know I'm in this! - Don't move! - No! Are you out of your mind? - What? I'll show you what crazy is! - No...! Get out of here! I'll handle it! - Get back! - No... - Get back inside! - Don't shoot! The mastermind didn't want anyone to die, but he couldn't subdue the robbers... so he went back to get his gun. - Don't shoot...! - What are you doing? No...! Hey. Just go. I'll take care of things here. You'll take care of this? I'll take care of you! No, you can't! You can't kill him! - He's my friend. - Even if he's your father, he must die! Don't move! Drop your guns! His intent was to stop the robbers from killing his friend. But then the traffic police showed up. The traffic police was a good man. He swerved to avoid the mastermind... only to end up stopping right in front of the robbers. Freeze! Officer, I have nothing to do with this. Get down! You're not getting away! - Fong? - Fong...! Let's go! Mr Kwan... I was at the Gun Club. You taught me how to shoot. Wait! What are you doing? No... please don't to kill me. Police hotline? My surname is Kwan. You were pretty calm. You thought of calling the police in such a short time. That gave you a solid alibi. The mastermind, not me. If there's nothing else, I'll be off. Wait... Wait a minute. A heavy downpour unearthed the body. I see this photo and I think the mills of God grind slowly but exceedingly fine. He deserved it. What about me? Did I deserve to die too? Tell me! Did I deserve to die too? See you at the competition. Why did you use my account without my permission? I'll say I lost all that money. At most, I'll get fired. I don't really care. All you had to do was to ask. Did you think I wouldn't help? Ken. It's not too late for you to turn back. No matter what you've done, I'll pretend it never happened... as long as you agree to leave her. I cannot hurt her. She has been nothing but good to me. So have I. You were nobody. I made you who you are today. How can you do this to me? You stood in the way of every opportunity I had. You objected to all the decisions I made. What I should buy, what I should sell... everything! Because most of the time, your decisions were wrong! Are you blaming me for protecting you? I did it for your own good. I just want my dignity back. The results is what matter. Why bother about dignity? Goodbye. Ting. I've settled everything. We're leaving tomorrow. We'll go to Europe, South Africa... get on a cruise at Argentina to tour the South Pole... before heading over to Phuket. No, we'll get on a flight tonight. I can't. The traffic police might be waking up. I got transferred over to help out. Why are we leaving in such a hurry? What about the house? The furniture? Our finances? Our house in Phuket isn't ready yet. Where are we going to live? You have to give me time to resign. I have to go. We'll talk later tonight. I'm sorry. I have to kill you again. He's brain dead. His family agreed to pull the ventilator last week. How could you even suggest this? He's already in a coma. You want him killed again? This is the only way we can nab his killer. - You're a monster! - No! Warren, listen to me... Your brother is dead. He risked his life to arrest those robbers. If he could, he'd agree to this. Why can't you let Ken off? Stop picking on him! He has been lying to you all this while. If you want to prove his innocence, tell him Billy's waking up. You'll know the truth then. Why did you lie to me? He promised me he wouldn't shoot. He'd say that you turned yourself in. You can choose to leave your gun in there and come out. Or bring the gun out with you. I hope you make the right decision. You didn't find the targets. You've lost. This is the end of the competition. Unload and make clear. Are you ready? No! Miss Shaw, you're here. The chairman called to say you have great insight. Japanese yen has hit the roof. He said you were the only one who dared to purchase it. I caught a fish. Hey, what are you waiting for? Reel it in. Wow! - Okay. - You scored a big one. Yeah, so what? You're right. In a duel between two marksmen... a difference of a second or so doesn't mean a thing. I'm glad I wore a bulletproof vest. I'm talking about fishing.
