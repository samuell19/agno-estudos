Victor, pull over in front of the white building, emergency personnel is on the way. What is this place? Victor, come in. Is everything OK? OK, guys, we've got an unidentified Caucasian male approaching the car. Who the hell is this guy? I have no idea that the case is exposed. They got it. This mission is of utmost importance. You're going to have my own personal SEAL team, you're going to have an off the record F-35. All the bases are covered. The. That's right. This mission is about the cure, not that other treatment to lose its potency over time. This is the miracle cure, the one that's going to take away all traces of that disease in your daughter system.

And you look in her eyes and you see those eyes full of life. Then you're going to be very thankful that I put you on this mission. All right, gentlemen, let's go on and our satellite image, a live audience by patching you through. Two days ago, our lab in Los Angeles has been attacked by militants hired by our competitors. Our lead scientist managed to escape with our asset intact. Unfortunately, he was ambushed in the case has been stolen by this individual, Maxwell Powell. Mr. Powell has wasted no time in negotiating the sale of our property to our competitors. He's planning to rendezvous buyers at their headquarters within the next thirty five minutes. Your mission is to intercept the sale and bring my case back. Bruce, you'll drop. No, it is delivery point. From there on, you'll proceed on foot. No, it will take the prearranged shortcuts and should be able to intercept the target on multiple checkpoints. River, you will push Mr. Powell to Checkpoint Alpha Delta team. Your orders are on standby. We do not want unnecessary civilian attention. You will only engage if the situation gets ugly. With all due respect, we have enough firepower to deal with the situation and eliminate the target efficiently. Are you sure you want to leave it all in the hands of just one guy Delta team? I give the orders around here and you will sit tight until further instructions. Roger that. Based on the Sapphira one coming in at five six six oh five niner, I'm ready to engage. Do you copy over Zaffar one. Your eye in the sky should provide you with any updates and tactical support if you need it. If you need to take your doses, do it now. I don't want any distractions towards this mission is under way. Why don't you take you show me. So we have two hours with the last 10 seconds before you take a live life on the edge, baby. It's got me this far. These things aren't cheap. All right. They're actually quite expensive. The. My friend is not functioning, I have less than 40 minutes on this shot. Please advise over 40 minutes is plenty of time to complete this mission. We'll have a shot ready for you when you land. Copy that. We will eradicate this disease, but before we can do that, we must succeed today, Noah. Your daughter's counting on you. This monkey gets all the action and we get to what, dick around? 800 feet. We're in position. OK, now we wait. That gun is an actual piece of shit, you should have brought the scar. OK, I got it in two minutes. Our target is closing in your position. Start the music. Target is right down below me heading west. Buckle up. No target at three o'clock, approaching fast proceed to Checkpoint Alpha. Rieber, go ahead and smoke in. Know what you're up, Target is going to be coming in from the right stand by to engage in and. Time to intercept 10 seconds, stand by. Target is still on the move. My brother and I went through the tunnel. Started scanning, give me 10 seconds, updating waypoint Stanlib. It's about two klicks a long, curved road going away. No, no, I got to take a cab on your left. No way you got to make a run for it. Go get it, get moving. No, I had to run the checkpoint Bravo. What's the situation with Bruce? Job right now, right now, let me show you this ancient piece of shit, CANDU. The motherfucking Jim is Jim. Target is approaching Checkpoint Bravo, no, Apple's coming around the corner, get them now. Reaver, you're going to be in the CROSSFIRE. Stand back, let no one take the shot. The target is eliminated. Great job, everybody. Sapphire one, you're confirmed to get back to base our. Says. No, you did really good out there today. I was going to bring him back to base. We're going to take care of your daughters. I promise you, God is. Give me a secure line to reaver. Reaver know, is closing in on your location. I told him that the cure is for public release. But you and I know very, very well that that's not going to happen. I need you to take him out. I understand. So I finally got the case on. Yeah, man, you did good. Rieper, what the hell is going on down there? He's gone, sir. Jesus Christ, you just bring me my keys back. Sir, hostile targets are closing in at cornets two, three, eight or nine. I've got 12 no 15 vehicles and fast approaching Reaper come in. Satellite imagery tells me enemy personnel are now leaving their headquarters there. The buyers for our stolen case. One ready for. Altikriti. Rieper, you got to get out of there, go. Zaffar one, we got a situation here, and I'm going to need you to turn around. I want you to provide back up forever and then I want you to find no one to take that son of a bitch out for me. He's heading for the safe house. I have twenty one minutes left on my timer. I need my next dose as soon as possible. I'll double your pay. You just turn around, take care of this problem. Be fucking serious. I just completed the mission. I'm going to have my shot ready for me if I want, you don't do what I'm telling you to do. You are not going to get shot and I will watch you rot in that cockpit when you land. You better hurry up and get it done before it's too late. Whether that guy, man, we're going to kill. Dryfoos Zafar was going to take care of this one for you. I have a visual on the target. Rieper can handle the rest on his own. You track down no one, take that son of a bitch out for. Approaching the any minute 60 seconds. Thirty seconds. I have a visual on the target. You still and you engage, I got up, I got a. I got you, I got, you know. Don't even think about coming back here before he's dead. We've arrived at the south entrance of the tunnel ready for instructions. I want you to find him in that tunnel and bring it back to me. Alive or dead is just as good. We're going to get into douche alive. Whoever takes no out gets one hundred thousand dollar bonus. OK, here we go. Delta team, give me a scenario what's going on with no matter handling it now? Go right, get the fuck out of the. They can't get away got. Be guys, you guys are heading right into a construction zone. It does give me the man. The place where he had no picture frame, but. What's he getting out of the truck? But in my mind. That's a lot of damage to my body, like a fish tank in my truck clip hanging off the deal. I'm going to get you. Dude, you're right. That's a nice car. Mind if I take a look? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What's going on here? What are you doing? You might want to get out of the car. You've got to be kidding me. Rieper, they blew it, every one of those incompetent bastards did know was out there, and he's going to be looking for you, whatever, I need you to give me that case before he finds you. I think we have to say.
