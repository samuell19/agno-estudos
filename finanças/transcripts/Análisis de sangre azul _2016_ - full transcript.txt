Blue Blood Test Mental and Hygiene Clinic "Casa Tardán" Valdellomar Valley Huesca Pyrenees, Spain A medical film made by Dr. Pedro Martínez On January 2, 1933 we found a dying man in the frozen caves of Marboné (Monte Perdido). The survivor was taken to the Mental Clinic CASA TARDÁN, where I looked after him. With my limited English knowledge I tried to communicate with him, but the man did not know where he was, which country he was from, he did not even remember his name. It was obvious that he was a foreigner. Probably the first foreigner to set foot on this valley. Male, 1.95m tall, 1.85m long. Body Perimeters Chest: 85cm Abdomen: 86cm Hips: 90cm Left forearm: 22cm Left hand: 17.5cm Left calf: 33cm Dimensions Cranium Horizontal perimeter: 58cm Sagittal perimeter: 20cm Frontal diameter: 15.6cm Face Face width: 13.7cm - 11.2cm Face length: 18.6cm Face color: pink Hair color: blonde Iris color: blue Judging his body measures, our subject is prone to dreaming and disorders. His physical traits are delicate, so I rule out a criminal behavior. While dressing, the patient seems to ignore the right side of his body. I ask him to make some drawings so I can evaluate his symptoms. One side of his body is affected, to the point that he cannot "see" the right side of things. A strange symptom associated with memory loss that usually fades out over time. The patient 000715, "The Englishman" stays admitted at the Mental Clinic Casa Tardán indefinitely or until I manage to awaken his memory and find out more about his identity. Who is The Englishman? Hoping to find out more about The Englishman, we return to the place he was found: the dreaded and hostile Monte Perdido. The shape (on the left in the picture) could be some object that belongs to The Englishman. "A backpack!" I show the backpack to the Englishman to check if he can recognize his own personal belongings. Spikes Rope Ice Axe The Englishman is able to name every object found in the backpack, he can describe their use, but is not able to recognize them as his own. Car Gable The Englishman recognizes the American actor Car Gable in one of his magazines, and almost all the faces and places that appear in the paper. He seems to know everything about the world, but who he is. April, 1933. Spring is a good season for mental health. Madness calms down with the vivid colors of the sanitarium garden. Boxwood The Englishman is sensitive to the beauty of the countryside, curious to knowledge and, despite the obvious difference in class, he is kind with the other patients. Especially with women. The Englishman looks totally indifferent to his illness. A very common psychiatric symptom called "La Belle Indifference". Shape Interpretation Test The "Shape Interpretation Test" or "Rorschach Psychodiagnostics Test" is a modern method to evaluate personalities from a psychoanalytic point of view. With the interpretation of 10 inkblots we observe the psychic functioning of a person who finds similarities with clouds, flames, or "wonderful places, with mountains, with steep peaks" *Quote by Hermann Rorschach himself "What do you see here?" "The Announcing Angel" "Tibet" "Maasai, Maasai women" "King Kong!" "A butterfly, a Tineola butterfly" (Hesitates)... "A Stradivarius" An announcing angel, two Tibetan monks, two Maasai women, the scientific name of a moth, a Hollywood movie, a skyscraper, a coral forest, fireworks... The Englishman's answer represent a world of travels and leisure not only unique for this valley, but for anyone not belonging to the social elite. Who is The Englishman? An anthropologist? An explorer? A hermit? A deserted soldier? A mere mountain climber? The Englishman asks me for the Spanish name of a plant that he calls "Ramonda Myconi" and that I don't know at all. He plays the piano with a "swing" style, as he calls it. He also uses this "swing" word when he shows me his polo technique. The more I study the patient, the more convinced I am that he belongs to the so-called "leisure class". Either he suffers from delusions of grandeur or perhaps we have living at the sanitarium... a true English aristocrat. Clinical portraits on idiocy Filming on May 24, 1933 Heart, eye and ear diseases have been transmitted genetically. Also hereditary are premature deaths, early dementia and all sorts of degenerative diseases such as idiocy, present in 1 out of 8 people. Family consanguinity, often among cousins, has brought about the genetic collapse of this people, extending the idiocy gene like bad weed all over the valley. Many idiots go through catatonia episodes where they become wax statues. The following sequence registers the arm fall after 1, 5 and 30 minutes. In other cases, idiots repeat the gestures of the people they interact with, a symptom called "echomimia". Pyknic type Leptosomic type Physical constitution and character "Physique and Character" is a brilliant study by German psychiatrist Ernst Kretschmer, basis of all the theories by the Salamanca School, of which I am a member since 1929. This study affirms that: "Every individual's physique determines their temper and possible mental diseases, allowing us to divide the population in two major groups". Leptosomic type Tall and thin subjects Narrow chest Slender members Long face Notable osseous protuberances The leptosomic type has a refined character, very neat and demanding, especially with morals. Decent, deep and hypersensitive, his higher soul feeds from the beauty of subtlety. Pyknic type Subject of low stature Short and wide neck Bulky head Adipose tissue Abundant in the belly Weak musculature The pyknic type has a quarrelsome excitable and uninhibited character. Talkative and boastful, his anxious spirit does not deal with intellect, but with his lowest instincts. To this study I add a new hypothesis: What if we modify the physique in order to stop idiocy? The Englishman's physique is an inspiration to stop inbreeding in the valley and improve the lineage, as we do with plants and animals. However, the same isolation that caused this genetic decline has created an extraordinary richness in another species. I leave here a wonderful catalog of some arthropods found in the traditional trip to the Canau Falls. The melted water from the Canau falls is considered miraculous by mountaineers who used to go there to protect themselves from demonic possession. Popular belief aside, it is scientifically proven that frozen water smarten idiots up, or autistic people, as they are called in America now. In the last months, The Englishman shows a special predilection for Catalina Ferrer, the youngest patient in the sanitarium. If this relationship germinates, a happy and spontaneous eugenics will have occurred, i.e., a scientific improvement of lineage. A new genetic string may form, and I can affirm that it will be the first Anglo-Pyrenean cross in this valley's history. Mental and Hygiene Clinic "Casa Tardán" Films 1938-1942 April, 1938. Civil War is coming to the most hidden Pyrenean valleys. The 43rd Division of the Popular Army has destroyed all bridges that could help the enemy move forward. The men of the Valdellomar Valley decided to leave to fight. Many of them cross these mountains for the first time, leaving behind their home, lands and wives. Without any man around to forbid it, the townswomen have allowed me to film them while they launder the sanitarium's clothing. Also at the clinic, sick men have gone to the front or are hiding in the mountains, leaving only women, The Englishman and myself. Five years have passed since The Englishman was admitted at Casa Tardán and he still remembers nothing from his previous life. Instead, he developed a new identity as "Lord and Master" of the valley, calling himself Sir Valdemar Torn. The Englishman (or Valdemar Torn) has adopted this valley as his true birthplace and has at the clinic what for him is his only family. When I watch The Englishman's sons I see the innate qualities of his father and his evolutionary advantage with respect to the valley. Sensible pairing has been an essential duty in this valley. Not only a medical duty, but a moral one. Ana Bescós (30 years old) Serena Latre (22 years old) A new generation of healthy children grows in the clinic gardens, free from the illness of inbreeding. In 1942 The Englishman and I did our first trip outside the Valdellomar Valley. I intended to film the last wild Pyrenean ibex living on the north face of Mount Jacalito. Like so many times before, I filmed parts of this trip, not knowing that these would be the last images of The Englishman. And just like that, in a curve leaving the Lenza forest, I lost sight of The Englishman, and I never saw him again. We searched the area for many weeks, but found no trace of The Englishman, as if he vanished or reincarnated into a wild Pyrenean ibex. To my teacher, Gregorio Marañón, and to the anatomist and great friend Juan de Dios Escolar, whose ideas inspired this film and the genetic recovery of the Valldelomar Valley.
