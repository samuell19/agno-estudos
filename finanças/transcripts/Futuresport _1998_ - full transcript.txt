Meanwhile, there are new developments in the Free Hawaii Movement. Eric Sythe, the leader of the Hawaiian Liberation Organisation, has disappeared three days after storming out of negotiations... ...with Hawaiian governor Makena. There is fear. The militant organization may resort to terrorist acts... ...to make a statement. In New Orleans, security forces are at full alert... ...as the city prepares for the Futuresport World Championship game. In response to the terrorist threat, Futuresport superstar Tre Ramzey called the HLO, "A bunch of surfer punks trying to hog the best waves for themselves." The L.A. Rush are favourites to win... ...what promises to be the game of the century. We'll be back with further developments after this word. Delivery. If you could just sign. -Everybody into the meat locker. -This way! Now! -Status report. -Target Two is in position. What about Target One? No sign. Damn athletes are never on time for anything. Cool head, baby, cool head. The Pharaoh will be here. We just have to... ...wait for him to make his royal entrance. Him and Torres in one shot. The traitor and the snoop. It's a glorious day for the revolution, huh? Wish me luck. What's the hurry? Pre-game interview. I'm gonna keep my sponsors happy. Your sponsors, they have nothing to worry about. Besides, after this game, your Popularity Index will be even higher than mine. I don't think that was possible that anybody's P.I. index... ...could be higher than yours? What is it now, 390? 401. Not that you're keeping track or anything. Who's doing the interview? It's her, isn't? Alex Torres interviewing Tre Ramzey on the championship pre-game. That's gotta be worth 15 points at least. The network hold her back to cover the game. It's been 10 years since that first piece she did on Futuresport. And they want a retrospective. Nostalgia sells, you know. As long as you aren't nostalgic about her. Alex and I were over long time ago, sweetheart. Besides, just look at you. Who could compete with you? Nobody. And don't you forget it. -Here, turn. -Okay. For the Pharaoh who has everything. Quite a circus, isn't? Yes. Not like the good old days. Well, better get started. Rolling. Obike Fixx. Take one. We're here with Obike Fixx, the man who credited with creating Futuresport. Yes, yes, yes. Guilty as charged. I understand this is your first championship Sunday? Well, I never really showed much interest in the Pro Leagues. And the League never showed much interest in you? They don't like me nagging them. You know, having a conscience can be expensive. So you still contend that the League doesn't give back to the community? Well, yes, yes. It is my contention... ...that the League makes billions of dollars off of Futuresport. But without the kids in the Downzone, they wouldn't make a dime. -So, the hooves, the League... -Alex... -We're rolling. -It's the network. ...put some... Tre is on his way down. Now tell him we'll get back as soon as we finish with Fixx. Oh, no, it's all right. I understand. Tre is ratings. I am just doo doo. Tre, Tre, Tre! Hi! -Mr Ramzey, can I have your prints? -Later, kid, later. Oh, good to see you. Right. Anarchy, my girl. Check out my board. The port stabilizer is kind of tweaked. Whatever you say, captain. Way to accessorize. Thank you. Hey, anybody want to see a game? Target One has made his entrance. When I give the word, just like we practiced. Hold on. No, no, no, you may not quote me. I haven't said anything. -Spoke I mean, I barely... -I'm sorry, folks. I'm sorry. Mr Ramzey has granted an exclusive pre-game with Alex Torres. If you want your questions answered, you can watch Channel 90 along everybody else. Thank you very much. -Thank you, coach. -You are late. "You're welcome, Tre. Anything for you, Tre, my good man." Thank you, Tre, but you're still late. And if you want to thank me, you can win the game. My contract is up for renewal. Oh, Obike Fixx. Now, I never thought, I would ever see you at a pro-game. Really, you have to blame it on Alex. She can be extremely persuasive. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, well, I'm off. I'll leave you to your business. Easy. Hey, I'm having a victory party tonight after the game. You should come. Yeah. Win the game first, then the party. Bye. Okay. I'm all yours. I'll try to contain my enthusiasm. Over here. Same old Alex. Always in charge. -Is this good? -Yeah. Rolling. Tremaine Ramzey. Take one. Ten years ago Tremaine Pharaoh Ramzey became an overnight media sensation... ...after Channel 90's report on an obscure game called Futuresport. Now he's captain of the L.A. Rush, and here in New Orleans... ...for his third consecutive world Futuresport Championship. Mr Ramzey... Mr Ramzey? You know, Alex, I know you were ticked off when I dumped you, but I mean, we have not really reach the "Mr Ramzey" point. Cut! Wait. Two things. One, I don't wanna be here more than you do, okay. If it was up to me, I'd still be in Hawaii covering the recession. And two, you didn't dumped me, I dumped you! Despite what your autobiography says. So you read my book? -Are you okay? -Yeah. This is a political action of the Hawaiian Liberation Organization. HLO. Great. Alejandra Torres. Tremaine Ramzey. You've been found guilty of crimes against the Hawaiian people. Aren't you the popular couple? Come forward and face justice. How many? -Ramzey! Show yourself! -Nueve. Ramzey! Show yourself now! Everyone on your feet! On your feet now! You have 10 seconds to comply. -Ramzey! -Anarchy, my board. Show yourself now! Now, I could take them if I had a ball. That's my girl. -Coach? -Kamikaze 38 Float. If I pull this off, my P.I. rating is going through the roof. Don't blink. This is gonna be good. Ramzey! Show yourself! We've gone Iniki! Let go! -You're all right? -Yeah, thanks. Good. Now you owe me. Let's go. Everybody all right? Damn. Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh! Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh! Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh! Ladies and gentlemen, the L.A. Rush! Ten years ago I did a special report... ...on a man doing his best to survive a tragedy. Tremaine Ramzey, a former basketball rookie of the year, had watched the league collapse around... ...and in a worst point shaving scandal in sports history. A few months later, the league dissolved, and Ramzey started playing a new game. A game called... Futuresport. Two teams. Five players each. And only one way to score. Put the ball in the goal. One point for a throw, three for a slam. Let's watch! Today Futuresport is the most popular game on Earth. And Tremaine Ramzey, it's undisputed star. But the question is, has all the money, glory and publicity made the game and the players better? Or taken away everything that matters? Three in a row. Three in a row. Watch out for Jamiston. The man's a killer. And keep your passes crisp. And remember, team first. That means you too, Tre. Team is what I'm all about, coach. Jet, I want you to cover Blake. Hold on, coach, wait. Forget it. Becker's mine. Jet's gonna handle Blake. I want you to save yourself for offense. Don't worry, Easy, I can handle him. Don't you mean fondle him? -Hey! -All right, let's beat on the Griffins, not each other. Let's get it done. Come on! Tre? I have no time for anymore interviews. -You saw the story? -Yeah, you think, I sold out. Not only you. Everybody. Futuresport used to mean something. Now it's just a show. Lost where people stay glued to their vid walls. Now you're starting to sound like Fixx. You know, the story that I did was supposed to be about him. How he invented the game to keep peace between the Downzoner gangs. -But you focused on me instead. -I went for the ratings, okay. Yeah, well, thank you, it made me a star. Seriously, would you have been happier, if I had said no to the League, Alex? To said no to this, the money, the fame, the glory, everything? I wish I knew. I really wish I knew. Ladies and gentlemen, madams and Monsieur, it's time to play Futuresport. Tonight the world's greatest teams, the L.A. Rush and Berlin Griffins... ...go head to head in Championship 2025. All right, time now for the traditional team captain's meet and greet... ...where each bids the other best wishes for a good game. Hey, Pharaoh. I heard about your little run in with HLO. I hope you saved enough for the game. More than enough to take you to school, bean pole. Who knows, stubby? Maybe it's my turn to teach you a thing or two. Stubby? Nice, did you think about one yourself, Becker? -That's right. -Let us get it on, baby. Your mama. These two teams are really evenly matched. Both teams have stellar offenses, both teams have brutal defences. But most importantly, both teams have superstars playing flyer. For L.A., the game's top score... ...and world's most popular athlete Tremaine Ramzey. His nemesis, the young superstar to the name Blake Becker. Now this could be Ramzey's last season. Now young Becker would love nothing more than to take the Pharaoh's place... ...at the top of the world's Popularity Index. So, it all comes down to this, the Pharaoh versus the young Pretender in a battle for the crown. And listen to that, the crowd loves these two superstars. Now, here comes the race to the centre. Here we go, Becker take possession. And the game rules has five seconds to pass the ball... ...before it becomes electrified. The pass he does to Griffin's veteran Carl Vunsch, who looks wide open. Where's the Rush defence on this? Wow. Oh, wow. Flyer Jet spun into his head and intercepts! Oh, baby, what a gutsy move for a new flyer. Looking for a pass and it goes to Ramzey now. He's up and he takes a shot... And it's good! Yes. This is Jet Yuen's first season with the Rush. She hails from Singapore in the Pan-Pacific commonwealth. Gonna be a long day, rookie. The first half has been fast and brutal with the Griffins out in the front now. The Rush has got to start using teamwork if they want to catch up before the half. All right, action continues. Jet hands off to Tre, what else is new there? And Griffins defence needs to stop him. Tre takes a hit but fires the ball. And there it is! Tre Ramzey score is 500 point... ...putting him 17 points away from breaking his own scoring record. Vunsch has the ball now, just pretty looking for Becker who can't get to him. Here comes the Rush blocker. Don't be evasive as the ball starts to spark. He's still away from the goal. Can he ride the lightning? No! Vunsch gets sparked for a five second hold. If he'd been able to keep a grip and ride the lightning, he might have gotten a slam there. Give me the ball! Ramzey's got possession and he won't pass the ball. -Damn it. -It seems like Tre is more interested... ...in his record than teamwork now. And he scores. What the hell do you think you're doing out there? I told you to let Jet handle Becker. We're only down by nine. Yeah, well, we should be up by 20. It has been a while since we saw the Pharaoh trying to grip out a zap. But then Tre's game has changed a lot in the past couple of years. And somewhat say not for the better. Second half, players promises the shoot-out... ...we expect from superstars like Ramzey and Becker. Ramzey's got Hatchet Jack Jamiston on his tail now. Jet yells for him to pass and draw the hit. But Ramzey isn't passing and here comes trouble! Jet Yuen takes out Jamiston putting Ramzey in the tear! Yes, Tre scores again. He's only a slam away from a new scoring record. Hey, you should have passed. I was open. Did I score? I scored. And Ramzeys goal ties the score at 65 with seconds to go. The Rush really coming on strong now. Here's the deciding play. Griffins' ball. Stolen by blocker Tom Mayhew. No wonder he is called "Mayhem." He now pass Ramzey on the whip. Jet Yuen is in perfect position to accept for a pass. Once again Ramzey goes by her. What is this? He wants the winning points by himself. Here come the Griffins defence. What a move! Ramzey needs only one to win. The five seconds are out. Tre's trying to ride the lightning. Turnover, Ramzey! The ball is scooped up by Vunsch. Here comes Vunsch. And he scores! The Griffins win! What the fuck? What a major upset here today. Hey, you were supposed to tweak my port stabilizer. Nice job! I had no speed. -What? -I had no speed. It is your damn fault! Your port stabilizer is purring! Then explain to me what the hell just happened out there? Checked a mirror lately? -Oh, nice job, Jet. You should talk. -Yeah. Great game. I don't care what anybody say, we earned this win and here's the proof! Show us the trophy. I like dedicate this victory to the people of Pan-Pacific Commonwealth... ...and everyone out in Australia! Any comment on the growing tensions... ...between the Com and North American alliance? No worries. What I see, you yanks stop sticking your big foot... ...where they don't belong and everything will be peachy. Otherwise the Com's gonna freaking do to you, what I did to Mayhem! You tell that cheating Aussie son of a bitch... ...that if he wants a piece of me, he freaking knows where to find me. They got an expression in Germany... "Alles glisten is nicht necessarily geld. " I think that pretty much sums up what happened here today. Hey, Mom. We won! No comment. -Tre. -I said, no comment! And that ends our coverage for this evening. What? No victory party? No dancing girls? Nothing? Didn't see the game? Yeah, man, I saw it. It hurt my eyes. What I can tell you, Tre, if you use to play like that in the Downzone, you might not have made it in the court alive. Yeah, well, I don't play in the Downzones anymore. True. Maybe that's what the problem is. You know, sometime, Tre, you can go up so high, you can't see the ground anymore. Maybe you shall come back to the old neighbourhood a bit. You might jog your memory as to what really matters. And what doesn't. What the hell were you thinking? Come on, babe. It's not that bad. Look, I'll get back the championship again next season, all right. And then at that victory party, I'll announce our engagement. It will be exactly like we planned, just one season later. You don't have another season. If I marry you now, my P.I. rating will go into the sewer... ...and that is one place I'm not intended to go. Lorelei has left the building. Down. Team plane's about ready to leave for home. You want to talk about it? Nothing to talk about. Open. -Hello, Edgar. -Welcome back, Mr Ramzey. There's a late supper heating in the oven, your personalized news clips are ready for viewing, and your post-game champagne is chilling in the refrigerator. We lost, Edgar. Slings and arrows, sir. Slings and arrows. You have my sympathy. I take it Ms Lorelei won't be joining us? I lost her too. We broke up. Ms Anarchy anticipated that possibility when she upgraded my program last month. Something to do with saving the gene pool. Well, your romance failed, I'm instructed to play the following recording. It's hard to believe just four little words... ...could bring me so much pleasure, but here they are... -"I told you so." -I told you so. I will remove Ms Lorelei's name from the authorized entrance. What a good idea. Might as well play my messages. You suck, Ramzey! Cut. Give me somebody I know. Mr Ramzey, all of us here at Ohmforce Sportswear... ...want you to know how much we appreciated your efforts... ...as our being our spokesman this past season. However, we also want to express... -...our deep concern... -Next. Hey, Tre, I guess you're at home licking your wounds right now. But me and Anita and Chantal here were planning to party! On second thought, Edgar just... Give me a summary of the rest of the calls, please. You have seven additional messages. Three from your agent, one from your lawyer, two from your sponsors. And one call from Ms Torres. Alex? Play that one. Tre, I need to talk to you. It's really important. Tomorrow, game time. 39-14. You there. Move along. Tre, hi, I'm glad you remembered. Thirty nine points, 14 assists. My stats the day that you came down to do your documentary. -That's right. -I could never forget. -Want to walk? -Yeah. Your message, you said it was important. Yeah. It is the HLO. Losers. What about them? I wouldn't write them off so fast. When I was called back to the main land, I was researching a report on the Hawaiian Separatist Movement. And Tre, the HLO is dangerous. Even people inside them are afraid of them. I thought they were strictly small time. Maybe few years back. But things are changing. They got money and a lot of it. -Let's take them. -Wait. Let's see how much she knows. They're building up for something, something big. And that attack on us was their first move and show people they mean business. -I know that look. -What look? -That look. That right there. -What? You're planning on going up against them. Well, I need your help. See, the network doesn't want to run my piece. They say it's too political and politics doesn't sell air time. Yeah, but I do. Well, you are the one of the most prominent Hawaiians in the country. -Alex, I'm a quarter Hawaiian. Quarter. -Yeah. You know, the one time that I have to go there, I went just for the all-star games, that's it. Yeah, but you stood up to them twice. Remember, you called them the punks on the air. -Huh? Yeah? -No. And when they tried to get you back, you made them look like idiots. But if you agree to speak out against them, I give my air time, we can force people to pay attention, okay. And maybe help prevent whatever HLO's planning... ...and save a lot of people's lives. That's enough. Let's take them. You know, I've missed this. -Missed what? -Missed the energy, the causes. The pursuit of truth and justice in the North American way. So you'll do it? Fixx? Easy, man. The ambulance is on its way. Tre? Tre. I have died and gone to heaven. And all the angels look like Alex. It must be the drugs. I'm glad you're okay. Thanks to you. I suppose that grenade was HLO's version of viewer feedback, huh? Everyone's a media critic, huh. So, when do we do our story? We don't. The HLO beat us to the punch. They just launched a whole new bomb campaign. Mostly on the islands. Military bases, government buildings, the works. I'm not exactly spreading sunshine, am I? Good news never really was your specialty. Well, I promise next time we get together I won't be so depressing. There gonna be a next time? Guess that's up to you. Alex? Thanks for stopping by. Futuresport superstar Tremaine Ramzey... ...was released from Southland hospital today ...after narrowly escaping an HLO terrorist attack. Meanwhile, in Honolulu, governor Makena... ...has asked for fellow troops to help battle the HLO terrorism. The Pan-Pacific Commonwealth... ...has responded by threatening to intervene militarily... ...to protect the Separatists. Stay tuned for Hawaiian Crisis, day three. Hey, hey, how's it going? How are you doing? I just... I got it. I'll handle it. Would you do me a favour, all right. Spread the word. I'm gonna do an autograph session. Half an hour. One print, one graph per person. Then when you find Fixx, tell him I want to talk to him, all right. Good. Let's go. If you guys play your cards right, you can get some autographs too. It's a joke. All right now. Authorized. If I catch you selling this thing on the net, I'll personally gonna hunt you down and kick your butt, right. Authorized. -Authorized. -Mr Tre. Vayase. I got biz. That means everybody. Yes, man, scatter. Let's walk, man. I wanted to thank you for helping me and Alex out the other night. I owe you. Yeah, man, I couldn't let you get killed in my neighbourhood. It would make me look bad, man. I see you do that a lot, don't I? -Yeah. -To make you look bad. Hey, Mr Fixx! I can't help but wonder. If you'd been the one in Alex' special, maybe you'd be the star instead of me. Maybe. If I would have wanted it. But see, that's not Futuresport was supposed to be about. So, what am I gonna do for you? I got a little problem with HLO. Wha...? I got a little problem with HLO. I need your help. See, I'm cool. I got league security watching my back, so I am covered. But Alex... She got nobody. Yeah, so I was hoping, maybe you could keep an eye on her for me, you know, hire some ronin if you had to. By the ones and zeros, man, whatever it takes. No, no, no. Why do you think I got that kind of pull, man? This is the Downzone. Everybody knows you're the man. True. All right. Let me see what I can do. The deal is, you have to come back around more often. -Deal. -I will hold you to that. Thanks. -How's it? -Not bad, not bad at all. Our sponsors were very generous. Ten million euros to cover our L.A. operations. And that, my love, is all untraceable. It's too bad you will not get that chance to spend it. What the...? Have you lost something? Listen, holler, I don't know who you think you are, but... I know exactly who I am and you should too. You see... ...this is my neighbourhood you're playing it. I don't like uninvited guests. Let me guess. Obike Fixx. I was hoping to get a chance to talk to you. Well, you better talk quick. Governor Makena was the latest victim of violence in Honolulu... ...when his motorcade was ambushed... ...on his way to negotiations with HLO leaders. Meanwhile, Hawaiian Separatists define a reason result... ...to popular elections have issued a declaration of independence. Mr Ramzey, you have a visitor. Let her in please, Edgar. -Hey. -Hey. Welcome. I assume, I have you to thank for the Downzoners... ...that had been shadowing me for the past two days. Is someone shadowing you? I'll just... I do not need babysitting, Tre. You know, that's the exact same thing I said to the league... ...when they sent me my bodyguards. -And do you know what they told me? -What? They said, "You're too valuable to risk." That's sweet of them. What are you making? Spicy Pharaoh Rolls. Spicy Pharaoh Rolls? What is that? It's a secret for me to know and for you to find out. I don't know. Are you afraid? Alex Torres, the fearless reporter is afraid? Bring it on. Okay. That is what I'm talking about. Not bad? I've been watching your reports, it's scary stuff. It's gonna get worse. According to my sources, the Com's crime Pan-Pacific brotherhood are sending a fleet to Hawaii. In response, the North American alliance has their entire military on alert. I mean, there could be a war. I thought the UN were negotiating. The UN can't negotiate a real estate deal. They got no teeth. And no P.I. rating. Is something going on behind those green eyes? If we go to war, people will gonna die. Hawaiians, North Americanos, Coms. And most of the casualties won't even register on the P.I. metre. Yeah, they'll be Downzoners. People too poor to dodge the draft, or bribe their way off the frontline. People like those kids playing Futuresport out in the streets. If I wanted to hold a press conference, could you get me worldwide coverage? Even if I didn't tell anybody what it was about? Well, you are the Pharaoh. Even though your P.I. ratings have slipped, you still got the President beat by 10 points. What did you have in mind? A publicity stunt. The biggest, stupidest publicity stunt in history. I suppose most of you were expecting a retirement announcement. Well, I hate to disappoint, but I'm not ready to give up the game. At least not today. I do know that I can't play forever. And where I've gone, I'd like to be able to say that I made a difference. When we played Futuresport back in the Downzones, we used it as a substitute for gang warfare. A way for us to settle scores without having us to throw down. Now I've been thinking, if than worked in the Zones and it did, why could it not work in the world? Right now, the Com and North America are squaring off... for one of the biggest turf battles in decades. No rules, no holds barred. The winner take all. If that happens, a lot of people are gonna die. Well, I say, if we're gonna act like Downzoners, why not go all the way? So on behalf of my gang, the North American Alliance, I challenge the Com to a game of Futuresport. Our team against yours. The winner gets respect, bragging rights and the Hawaiian Islands. Now, I know what you're probably saying. "The Pharaoh has lost his mind. He's gone completely loco." Maybe I have. But look at it this way. Which would you rather have? One high stakes game of Futuresport, or a war? The ball is in your court. Thank you. I can't believe those in Honolulu agreed to this. Staking everything on some game? They didn't have much choice, Keahi. Our Com advisors made it very clear, they're giving us money and weapons, that's one thing but nobody's ready to go to war. There wasn't gonna be a war. The Mainland would've backed, you said so. And I was right. They didn't backed down. They agreed to play Ramzey's idiotic game. And now we can win our independence without even firing a shot. And there isn't a damn thing... ...any of those loyalists in Honolulu can do about it. But what if things don't go our way? What if the Com loses? That would be unfortunate. So, we'll just have to make sure the Com wins. Is that not right, Mr Fixx? Like Tre said, "the winner takes all." What is this shit? Well, haven't you heard, we've been drafted. Yeah, I got the e-mail. Now, I just gotta find Ramzey so I can shove it up his ass! Feel free. Just wait until after the game. I know what you're all thinking. This is some kind of a giant scam to raise my P.I. rating. Well, you're wrong. This is real. I'm trying to stop a war. And I need your help. All of you. If I didn't know better, I think you actually believe that shit. Not me. This is vintage grade-A Pharaoh bullshit. You don't believe me, Mayhem? That's fine. I don't care. If it helps you guys, come look at it this way, we win this game, you're all heroes. Heroes. That means you can write your own ticket. Personal appearances, TV contracts, whatever. Hell, maybe they'll name a perfume after Willard here. There he is. Cash and P.I. ratings. Tremaine Ramzey I've grown to know and love. Think whatever you want, Becker. All of you. Just as long as you play. What about the rest of you? Is anybody leaving? Well, then... Let's get to work. We should've mounted this thing with a bomb. Then the NAA would have no team. Then if you want my help, you have to do this my way. No bombs. Nobody gets hurt. You getting a conscience, brother? Well, if I didn't have a conscience, sister, then I wouldn't be doing this. And here I thought you were doing it for the money. Money for his people, Keahi. Mr Fixx is a philanthropist. Yeah, five million euros can go a long way in the Downzones. And as long as they don't have to die in a war, my people don't give a ding-dong didly about what flag fly over Hawaii. A man after my own heart. So what's our next move? All right, all right. Okay, let's try it from the top. No! No! That is it! Becker, you should have passed the ball to Ramzey. Oh, yeah, that's great. You know, whenever I am in a key situation in a game, I ask myself, "What would King Tut over there do right now?" And somehow, coach, I don't think he would've passed it to me. Hey, listen, you slapdick... Hey, hold on, coach. He's right. I would not have passed it to him. Well, you are a slapdick, too. Stairs. Fifty sets. Both of you. Now. What? He's fucking serious? He's serious. Come on. What's the matter, old man? You running out of gas? No, but I do have this sudden pain in my butt. Is it haemorrhoids? Yeah. I named them Blake Becker. Ready to go again? Hey, scan that. All right, that's it. You can stop. How many was that, 30? You losing count? Are you getting senile? Hey! You two! Should we listen to him? Why start now? First one to the top. I don't know, coach. It looks like love to me. Yeah! Winner and still champion! You gotta be kidding me, man. I just smoked you. Don't make me show you again. Oh, why not? Because I can barely stand, much less walk. Man... That was the most idiotic display of macho Bushido I have ever seen. Hey, Anarchy. With oestrogen challenged like you running this planet, it's no wonder it's such a mess. Down with the Patriarchy. Power to the Goddess. I was gonna ask if you need an equipment manager, but now I'm not so sure. Please, Anarchy, wait. Stay. We can use all the help we can get. Yeah, I noticed. I'm sorry about what I said after the game. I didn't have anybody else to blame. I'm sorry. Forget it, Tre. You want forgiveness, you're gonna have to do a lot more than apologize. But it's a start. Okay. Okay! Anarchy is back in the house! And so are Becker's pants! Winner and still champion! Just got the rosters for the Com team. Here they are. Starting with Hatchet Jack Jamiston. Jet Yuen. Jet's gonna play for them? Last time I checked, Singapore was part of the Com. And so is Okinawa, which means Otomo Akira. And rounding out the starters: Sebastian Krajenski. And Kiwi Madigan. Oh, man, not "Down Under". She's a foreign psycho. Yes, good company for you. Five starters, five all stars. Fantastic. All right, so we got a game. Listen up... stars don't win games. Teams win games. I'm not worried about winning, I worry about staying alive. Oh, shut up. You look about as happy as I feel. This whole thing a buck if you ask me. My brother lives in Honolulu. Those HLO almost got him killed when they blew up the state capital. -So why are you here? -Same reason as you. Pan-Pacific Unity and all that garbage. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for volunteering. It gratifies me deeply to see your love of sport, your dedication to the Commonwealth, and your sympathy for our oppressed brothers and sisters in Hawaii. My name is Neville Hodgkins, I'm to be your team's government liaison officer. -Internal security? -What do you think? So, if there's anything you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to come to me immediately. I know you're going to make the people back home very proud. Or else... Does the back still bother you? No, I feel great. How are you doing, coach? I'm fine. I still like the doctor to take a look at that. Hey, if you get hurt, the league will have my hide. Whatever you say, coach. Tremaine... This is a... ...noble thing that you're doing. I'm proud of you. Thanks, coach. Thank you for letting me be part of it. Hey. So you're actually gonna doing this? I thought you'd be proud. Isn't Futuresport to stop a fight, wasn't that the whole idea? Remember the last game you played before you turn pro? Yeah, against Playa NWC. Yeah, fight for the right to Sawtelle Park. You know, I never actually kept track of what those games were for, I just played. You remember what they did to Carlos before the game? Yeah, I wish I didn't. Listen now, Tre, this game with the Com... This is not an exhibition game or pro-game. This is straight up territorial fight. Street rules, Tre. Before the game, during the game, after the game. What are you saying? Do you think the Com are gonna mess with us? I'm telling you, they're a lot tougher and nastier than NWC. I don't know if I can protect you, man. It's a little late for me to back out now. -Is that right? -Yeah. Now, I never supported you becoming pro. I thought you were a sell-out. You said, "No, no, no. The man have a right." In this society we live in, money is respect. -And you deserve respect. -Yeah, absolutely. Well, news flash. A dead man can't earn a thing. Welcome back, Mr Ramzey. How did you get inside? I asked politely. Please, sir, feel free to melt my circuits... ...if I did allow Ms Torres to enter. You have my sincerest apology. Shall I call security? No, no. Absolutely not. It's quite all right. Would you like a drink? I would love one. In my own house. My favourite. You remembered. How did it go? It could've been better. But at least we have a team. Now, if the NAA and the Com will just keep their side of the bargain, we could have something. I think you've changed, did you know that? You just remind me of someone. Who is that? This amazing guy. Smart. Handsome. He wore his heart on his sleeve. He's an ex basketball player, who started playing Futuresport in the streets. He went pro about 10 years ago. Sold his soul for fame and fortune. Oh, you know him? He and I were close once. But I have lost touch with him. I think it's never too late... ...to make up with an old friend. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah. Are you awake? I'm a light sleeper. How do you feel? My back is killing me, but besides that, pretty damn good. You? I feel better than I have felt in a long time. Here. I have something for you. -Me? -Yeah. I wanted to give you this before we broke up. Before you left me. But I never really had the opportunity, so now I have the chance to finally give it to you. It's beautiful. How come it won't open? The hinges are frozen shut. I'm not even sure what's inside. My mom always said that it was a family secret. This is your mom's? And her mom's before her. Oh, Tre, I can't take this. Please. I really want you to have it. Promise me to keep it on until the game is over. Just for luck. Since when are you so superstitious? I'm an athlete, goes with territory. Sir, sorry to interrupt, but you have an incoming message. Not now, Edgar. I'm about to get very busy. It's marked extremely urgent, sir. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to reprogram my house. Okay. Put it through. Pharaoh, I heard your doctor suggested back surgery. Who the hell are you? Just a friend with a little friendly advice. Go in for the surgery. Don't play in the game against the Com. Or a bad back will be the least of your worries. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that Capetown Sables that I hear calling... ...to confirm their original offer? -Did they pay? -Oh, yeah. -Anybody seen Coach? -No, he must be running late. Coach is never late. Building security said they let him in about an hour ago. Looks like he's meditating again. Coach! Hey, Buddah. -Coach. -Coach. I thought you scared us for a second there. He fell asleep while meditating. Come on. Coach. Coach, we're all here. Son of a... -Who authorized to hit on Douglas? -I did. You got a problem with that? Hell, yeah. I only agreed to help to keep people from getting hurt. -That's what you're doing. -Douglas is dead. So? That's one man. If there was a war, millions would die, and most of those would be Downzone cannon followers. If you want to stop that, you help us. When I make a promise, I keep it. That's what I like to hear. Do you want to talk about it? It wasn't supposed to happen this way. I mean, that was the whole point of the stupid game. Prevent people from getting killed. Well, Tre, it wasn't your fault. Douglas knew what he's getting into. He believed in you, what you're trying to do. But it doesn't mean he had to die for it, Alex. Well, you didn't kill him, HLO did. They should be held accountable for it. What if it doesn't work? What if we play the game... ...and then North America and the Com, they still go to war? Well... Right now, there are 10,000 NAA marines... ...in transport ships sitting off shore Honolulu. Not to mention the entire Com fleet is somewhere waiting in the Pacific. And no one is fighting yet... ...because of you. At the very least, you've kept some of those soldiers alive for a few more weeks. And maybe if we're lucky, they'll never have to fight at all. Either way, you owe it to them to not give up and give it a try. You owe it to them and you owe it to Douglas. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Where is Willard? Gone. He said it was not worth the risk. And he was right. So, any volunteers? I talk to every single coach in the League, no one is interested in taking over for Douglas. What's the matter? Afraid it might be bad for their health? That, and the fact that the salary sucks. But I did find one person stupid enough to take the job. -Me. -You? I've been playing Futuresport for 10 years. I know every single trick in the book. And this game is way too important to just give up. Oh, spare us the nobility act, Ramzey. I mean, how much do you think will this gonna boost your P.I. rating? Ten points? Twenty points? How about zip. I fired my P.R. firm this morning. So sit down, Mayhem. Sit down. Take a look at this. I've drawn up new offensive sets... ...and incorporated few new plays. Let me know what you think. These are all keyed to Becker. You want me to score? Have you experienced any sharp blows to the head recently? If I call the shots, everybody's gonna expect me to hog all the glory. And it makes perfect sense. So I'm gonna set a brand new Futuresport record in assist. Provided of course, you can put the ball in the goal. Watch me. And one more thing, I want you guys to meet our new defensive coordinator. Oh, great. Mr Amateur Hour? He invented the game. Show some respect. Better. Maybe this was a mistake. Yeah, it might have been a mistake. And Becker, you're the one who's making it, man. These are street rules that we're playing here, street rules. I'm sure they didn't teach you those in Notre Dame. Okay, fine. So who are these guys? Our new cheerleaders? These are your bodyguards. They're gonna watch your backs until game time. Hey, I don't like you. All right, let's get to work. Okay. I didn't expect to see you here. That makes two of us. It means a lot to Tre, you helping him out. Sometimes I think he actually might be doing a good thing. Maybe it's 10 years late, but I feel like I owe you an apology. I know when you invited me to the Downzone, all you wanted was a story about street gangs, settling their differences peacefully, and... instead you got this. I'm responsible as anyone for that. Why? Did you plan it? No. I went along for the ride. And... ...you got hurt. I'm sorry. No problem. Water under the bridge. Game time in five hours. And no matter what your politics one thing for sure, this is shaping up to be one of the greatest sporting events in history. Tell me again what a great idea this is. But tell me slowly. You're doing a good thing, Tre. Win or lose, at least you're giving your best shot. Yeah, yeah, "It's how you play the game," I know. So, when are you getting here and cheer me on? Well, the game doesn't start for another five hours. You shouldn't even be there yet. Yeah, when I was a player, I never showed up to the arena until the last second. -But now that I'm coaching... -Security alert! Security alert! -Alex, what's going on over there? -I don't know. What are you doing? Edgar, give me a wide angle view. Oh, Ramzey, let me make this quick. Lose the game, or your lady friend dies. You guys, Alex has been kidnapped by the HLO guys. What about the Rastaman? Wasn't he supposed to be looking out for her? He's missing too. -So what do we do? -She's not my girlfriend. Mayhem is right. It's not your problem, it's mine. -I'll take care of it. -Hey. -I found her. -Good. Or at least the tracker you put in her locket. Good, good, good. You put a trace on Alex? -Paranoia is your friend. -Damn right. Nagatek? What the hell are they doing there? -Man, we should call the police. -No way. Chief Connor and the stormtroopers come blasting... ...and they'll kill Alex in the crossfire. Forget it. -Where are you going? -To get her out of this. I'm coming with you. No, Anarchy, that's ridiculous. It's too risky. Why do you always have to be such a goddamn hot dog, huh? What? This is exactly what you did in the Championship. You try to win the whole thing by yourself. What, did you forget that you are part of a team? She's coming along and so am I. -Me too. -Yeah, me too. All right. -I don't know what to say, man. -Try "thank you." Thank you. Are you coming? Not me. Momma made sure didn't raise a fool. -Whatever. -Hey. If you're not back by game time, I'm keeping your endorsement money for myself. Nice shot. -Highest shooting percent in the division. -Just barely. Yeah. All right. Here. You two guys watch the deck. Everybody else with me. All right, now where? Your guess is as good as mine. We might as well go this way. Hey, guys, maybe we should split up. Fixx? What are you doing here? Well, don't you get it? It's like in those old flat screen movies. The cavalry coming to the rescue. Well, that's not it, is it? No. -How long? -A couple of weeks. Why, man? Do you know how much money the League donate to the Downzone... ...charities every year? Ten hundred Kay. Ten hundred Kay. The HLO dropped 10 times that in a week. That money can do a lot of good, man. Then why you're helping us all of a sudden? Because I don't like them and I'm keeping their money. I don't trust him. I do. One hour until game time now... ...and the North American locker room remain shut tight. Whatever the Pharaoh is telling his troops, he doesn't want us to be part of it. Well, he'd better be telling them to lose. At least for your sake. Mr Sythe. I just saw your man Tre. Bring her. Hey! It feels good. Come on, come on, come on. Yes. Autograph? Flyers... Hold your hand every second. Gonzales, are you all right? Sorry, coach, I'll be okay. Go get Alex. I saw her go around the corner. Look out for Sythe! I'll give your boyfriend credit. He has guts. I'm sorry that you're gonna have to suffer for it, Alex. Alex... Come out, come out wherever you are. Aloha, baby. Yeah. Now it's on. Let's go. Amplified reflexes. Not too shabby, huh? Nice move. Where's Tre? Come here! Come here, sweetheart. Aren't we just...? Pathetic. Look at you. The fallen hero. I told you should have had that back surgery, Tre. Hey. Yeah, tell me about it. I came here to save you, and you end up saving me. Come here. Yes, get it, man. That's enough. Oh, excuse me. I'm really sorry to have to break up this beautiful moment, but don't you have a game to play? Now, we've just gotten word the North American locker room is empty. Now, I don't know what's going on here, but if they don't show up soon, we're going to have a forfeit on our hands. Looks like your friends did the job. Amateurs. But useful. Wait, the North American team has finally arrived. The details are sketchy, but police say, those responsible for detaining the team are in custody. Oh, and here they come! The game will go on! Well, I'll be damned. You know, it's hard to believe this game will actually replace war, and it's also hard to believe that Ramzey and Becker... ...are playing on the same team. Of course, there's concern that with Jamiston and Yuen... ...playing for the Com, war might break out here. Let's play Futuresport! There's the battle cry from Ramzey. Don't expect these two teams to take this down lightly. Destroy them. Yeah. Here's the opening jump. Jamiston illegally wipes Ramzey! That's gotta hurt! Jet Yuen has possession. To Krajenski. An easy score! For Pacific Commonwealth. Ramzey's got Jamiston all over him. He need to get rid of that ball. And he finds Becker, but gets hit by Jamiston. Becker scores! This is war. What kind of fucking cheap shot was that? We're playing by territory now, that means street rules, you stupid fuck! Cocksucker. And the guys kicking the shit out of me! That's the general idea. You want sub out? Oh, hell no. Who'll take my place? Gonzales? She got a bullet on her shoulder, man. As long as they're kicking my ass, you're gonna be wide open. Well, the North American has taking the heat by playing super physical now. Mayhew literally sweeps a path for Becker. Look at him go. And Mayhew is down, but Becker puts it home! -Fuck him. -Heads up. What was that? You just let Blake scored. If you keep playing like that, pretty soon they're gonna be out of players. Then let them try to score. Watch yourself. Our keeper has his eye on you. Red 17! Red 17! Becker's got the ball... But Jamiston slams Mayhew! Oh, my! And Becker scores! And look at Mayhew, he's still down. Ladies and gentlemen, this game has a whole new set of rules. -Fuck! -Anarchy! I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna fucking kill him! Fucking son-of-a-bitch! Oh, fuck! It's broken. Medic! Park, you're in. Fucking cocksucker! I'm gonna kill you! Ramzey, you're next! The Pharaoh's moving well down the court shaking off interference... ...take to the pass from time to time. Hands it off to Becker. Becker scores on a Ramzey assist! That's a new one! Jet Yuen's open. She puts it home! Shit! Krajenski clocks Ramzey for no apparent reason! Now how more abuse can the Pharaoh take? It looks like you are running out of players. Fixx? I haven't done this in a long time. Wish me luck. Ladies and gentlemen, a new substitution for the North American team. Obike Fixx, the man credited with inventing Futuresport... ...now takes the field on defence. -Aren't you getting too old for this. -Yeah. Let us show them how we used to do to the old days. Deal. Ball is up now. Jamiston tries to interfere, but he's tripped up by Obike Fixx. And he's not happy about it. Street rules. I invented them. Wow, what a hit! A brutal shot on Jamiston by Obike Fixx. That has to be one of the most blatant fouls... ...I've seen in 10 years of covering this game. Shame about your boyfriend. Yeah, tragic. Not bad. Have you ever thought about going pro? Hey. Tell Madigan, from now on we play a clean game. I wouldn't have it any other way. Things are heating up between these two teams. Ramzey's moving fast. The man on a mission. Look at his eyes. Oh, he's boxed in and unable to pass. What's he going to do? Oh my... Can't miss. Only the Pharaoh moves like that! Great block by Fixx that came up out of nowhere. His five seconds are up. Now the ball's getting him abused. Can he hang on? Oh my, what a play! Tremaine Ramzey rides the light night to tie the score. Now, that was vintage Pharaoh. -How much time left to the clock? -Twenty seconds. Good. Because I can't take much more. In just seconds, we'll know Hawaii's fate. Now, Yuen's got possession and she's driving hard. Oh, it looks good. Oh, Ramzey intercepts it! He's got airborne! Ramzey's riding right into trouble. Does he have any more moves left? He scores! Blake scores! North America wins! North America wins! Forty three points for Blake Becker. One of the most incredible performances of Futuresport history! Hey, hot shot. Way to go. There you go. Ms Yuen, I must express the grave disappointment of your government. Save it. I played your game. I'm out of here. You played? You lost! No, you lost! After all, I'm a hero of the people. P.I. rating 205. You are nobody! A scapegoat. Enjoy your trip home. Fixx, you are the man! Thank you, man. I could not have done it without you. If it wasn't for me you would not have been in that situation in the first place. Judgement call. Judgement call. Listen, training camp starts really soon. The L.A. Rush needs a coach. No way, man, not my thing. No, no, besides, I think the Rush, they have someone who's a dingy of a coach. Everything I know, I learned it from you. True. Yo, Zee! President Clinton is on the line. -Tell Chelsea I'll call her right back. -Okay. -So how did I do? -Hey. Not bad for a jock. Tre... -What does she want? -I'll handle it. I will handle it. -Come to see the game? -I came to see you. And I wasn't disappointed. -No? -No. Well, Fixx and Blake, those guys were the real heroes. Hang on, you handle things right within 24 hours, nobody will think about them. All they'll care about is you. Is that how you'll play it, Tre? I'm sorry, I flew off the handle at you earlier. I'm sure we can work this out. Why do I get the feeling we wouldn't be having this conversation, if had lost? You can't blame me for liking winners. Besides, we could still be flash together. Yeah, we could be flash. But that's not my style anymore. I have moved on to real. Tremaine Ramzey has left the building! -Nice little change of pace. -Yeah, well, I'm growing up. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the blast-off classic between L.A. Rush and Sirocco. With Tre Ramzey stepping into the position as player coach, the Rush are poised on the brink of a new era. What awaits them? Disappointment or glory? We'll soon see. Because ladies and gentlemen, madam and Monsieur, it's time to play Futuresport!
