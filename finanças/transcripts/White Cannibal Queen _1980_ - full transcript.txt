It was some times ago... Heard the same strange cries. Then the next day, we found a scientific expedition that had been attacked and eaten by a tribe of cannibals. Cannibals? Perhaps they were wild beasts. Oh, no. [strange roar] [foreboding music ♪] ♪ What's the matter with you? Well... I think it was a big mistake bringing you two with me. But why?

After all, we've always been together. I don't really understand why... - Feeling cold? - No, not really, thanks. I'll go down below and bring up some hot coffee.

That's the one. It seems a wild animal attacked him in Malavi, neatly severing his left forearm. Taylor's still in shock. It must have been a dreadful business. In his delirium he kept repeating that a boat was attacked by cannibals who ate his wife. The Shelton Foundation organized the expedition. Would you like me to write a full report? No. No, that won't be necessary. [weakly] It was... horrible. [groaning] They were... Elizabeth... Monstrous... They were... eating... e-e-eating her... alive.

Just what did happen? Try to remember, Jerry. Try to remember. Tell me. You see, we were... - We were on the boat... - And? Then what happened? Then they were there. Who were they? Do try and remember. Make a effort. Tell the whole story, slowly, from the beginning. Jerry, do try. You know you can. Tell me. Please. Tell me. Come, go on. Is Professor Taylor here? Yes. Through there, ma'am. - Thank you. Please don't cry, Jerry, you'll make yourself ill. You'll only resolve this drama by being calm and taking things slowly, one by one. Are you Professor Taylor? My name's Barbara Shelton. I'm the president of the Shelton Foundation. We organized your expedition to Malavi. But I can see you're much better. As one can see.

An absolutely adorable man. I wanted to talk privately with you. You can speak quite privately here. I see. I need your help. You can always count on me, you know. On my help, that is. You understand. That's really very kind of you. I remember what happened. It was up river, about 20 miles from out destination. We spent the night aboard. The captain was uneasy about traveling at night. My wife, Elizabeth, and my daughter insisted on coming on the trip with me. I didn't want them to come... but they forced the issue, so I made the best... I made the best of the situation. But that night, without any warning, the Malavi made a sudden attack. They're one of the savage tribes in that area. My wife fell victim to their... cannibalism. [laughs] They said you were cured, but, uh... judging by what you've just said, I'd say you're far from well. But I'm telling you the truth. Believe me. Well, tell me how we can help you, but don't tell us fairy tales. It's not a fairy tale. I want to set up an expedition to go back to Malavi and find my daughter. Maybe she's still alive.

May we sit with you? It's a public place. Thank you. I'm told that you know the Malavi region very well. Better than the palm of your own hand. No. Leave the palms of my hands out of it. It's be impossible to know that area in depth. Oh, hi. - Who would know it? - Only the Gaevis know it well. That's just who we're looking for. The Gaevis. Well, in that case, you people better look for somebody else around here. But I was told that you trade with them. So, what about it? Even the Americans deal with the Russians without people making a big thing out of it. And anyway, I always use intermediaries. I must go into that region and I need a guide, supplies and a couple of hundred men to help me out. If you're really loaded... If you're loaded with a lot of cash you'll find two or three desperate men ready to go with you and run any races. Unfortunately, I don't have the money. His daughter was kidnapped by the Gaevis. When was that? Many years ago. You'd better forget about it. Anyway... you should know all about them. How dare you talk to me like that. You're just a filthy opportunist, a parasite, earning a living trading with people who devour women and children. You disgust me! Let's get out of here. Well, friend, what you say may be true, but I care about my hide. It may not be right, but it's all I know and I try to do it well. Trading with these people keeps body and soul together.

The fact is, I just made an endless trip trying to find you, that's all. But you didn't believe me when I told you my story. I realize that my sense of humor sometimes seems a little incomprehensible, but deep down I really mean well. The story you told us effected me most deeply. So Barbara and I have decided to help you. We've got all the equipment you could possibly require to carry out this expedition. Well, as they say... life is full of nice little surprises, isn't it? Oh, well, the coin always has two faces, doesn't it? And even I can make a mistake. - Are you being serious? - But of course. You come down to the harbor in Mesquite some time tomorrow. All right?

Oh, I know it'll be a tough trip, Professor. But we'll follow you wherever you go. I was very, very unjust with you. Barbara's felt very bad about it. She wants to make up.
