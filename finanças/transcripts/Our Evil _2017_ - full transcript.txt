You cook, baking... - You see. - Now we are filming. - Do you think it will work? - I do not know, but I do follow the recipe. Neat. - Chocolate, strawberries. - Lots of chocolate. - Yes! - Let's see... I think it needs a little more sugar. You probably do not know it before it's baked, but I think it can. I think I shelved it, can you get it? It's on the shelf. Do not you know where the sugar is, Michele? We move so often that I do not know where things is. - It's true. But... - I do not complain. No, I meant to say we've moved so often that we're back- - to this same house, to the same things. That's salt. - Yes, it is. - I've just used the sugar, I know. - It has red cap, Michele. - Both are white. True. Alike and different. I've been thinking about one thing. I could have done this for you more often. Stop, you've done so much for me. - Yes, but it's my first cake. - Then it will be the first of many. But I'm almost 20 years old. I'm getting old. - What time is it? - Eight. The batter is ready. The oven is hot. That's how we cheer! - Shall we see if it's ready? - Yes, let see!

Yes, lay down and rest. Do it. - And for this mess, then? - Do not worry, I'll take care of it. Relax. - Yes? Yes, Michele. Lay and rest. Talking about sleeping you were in my dream tonight. I dreamed about you. So? What happened? That was weird. Nothing special. Now you have to tell me, I'm curious. I was standing on a street. It was completely dark. And wet. Then I saw a clown under a light. He was carrying a boy in his lap. The boy cried and wept and cried. So I went forward. And he said he was an old friend of yours and you did the right thing. - So that was good? - Yes. But then he opened his arms... ...and the boy fell. And I woke up. A dream. Dreams are like that, Michele. Yes, but you know when you wake up and have the dreamy feeling for the rest of day? - Yes, I know. - But it's gone now. I'm tired. No, wait, wait, wait. - You didn't eaten anything today? - Very little. Take a sandwich from the fridge. Yes, that one. Eat, rest and take a shower, then we'll sing happy birthday for you later. Okay! So there! Can I ask for a favor? Sit the opposite of me so we can talk. Certainly. I have been thinking and come to the conclusion that I want to be a doctor. What is it? Nothing. That's really good. You are so studious, you must have talent for it. I dislike blood. But I do not know, I like people, I want to help people. Pediatrician, I thought. I support you. - I am very proud of you. - Thanks. You seem different. What is wrong? It's your birthday. I'm a little emotional, just that. But before we sing happy birthday for you, I want to tell you something. Certainly. The fate does not always match our wishes. I... I'm so sorry for the way we met each other. And for you that never met your mom. What is it? I'm so grateful to you, Dad. You are the best thing that has happened to me. You're more than a daughter. And you are the best daddy in the world. Honey, I... ...I want to tell you another thing. All... All I do is for your best. I'll try to... I'll try to always be by your side. I know. I know. It's time we sing now. - Is it already midnight? - Almost. Close your eyes. Just think of nice things. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... - Yes? - I want to order a pizza. One moment while I confirm the address. - Is it Rua Jo? Pedro 18? - Yes, it is. Well, then. Just a moment. What kind of pizza? - Mozzarella. A moment. - Do you need a change? - Yes, for 50. Okay. - It is shipped in 30-40 minutes. - Good, good. Thanks for calling, have nice night... INSTRUCTIONS PASSWORD If you see this video now... ...everything went well. I'll give you... ...the password. But first... ...I will tell a story. I... I do not remember where I've heard... ...that we... that we are like a radio. We receive energies... ...frequencies... And I... ...I receive different frequencies. Everything begun... ...when I was still a boy. The years went by and the events became stronger. And more frequent. I did not want to live anymore. I was... ...afraid. MISSING FERNANDA MALTA, 18 YEARS Arthur. Arthur. Arthur? Are you sleeping? Almost. If it were not you, I would not have stayed to wake you up. Do you want to stay here and sleep or do you want to go home? - We are going home. - Come then. - Hi, my son. - Hi, mom. There is pasta in the fridge. I'll go to bed. - Thanks. - Well, good night. - Mom! - Yes? - Do I get a hug? - Certainly. - Are you okay? - Yes, sure. Good night. MAMMA, NOBODY HAS THE BLAME! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME THAT I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS GOODBYE. MY AGONY AND SUFFER ARE UNBEARABLE. Help me! Thanks! Welcome! I have been waiting for you. Waited for me? - Yes. - Why? Because all artists need an audience. However, I did die? No. I did not let you. This is a dream. But the most important thing is- -that I'm super-hyper happy- because you are here. Can I be your friend? Yes. But tell me who you are. It's hard to explain. In the past, I was just like you. And I know how you feel. It seems to be easier to give up, right? - Yes. - But that's what they want. Your weakness. If you had cut your wrists in vain... ...everything that had bothered you... That's how they do. I can not stand it anymore. Arthur. I was born to make people laugh. And you? What were you born to do? You are a very special person. You know, right? Special people born... ...to help and sacrifice. Sacrifice everything! But not unnecessarily, as you thought. Without for a higher purpose. That's why you and I exist. But how do I do that? By saving the good souls... ...and condemning the wicked ones. How? I'll guide you. I have... Afraid? Do not be. Tell. I will help you. My family... ...is suffering so much. I'll tell you what happened. Who killed me? And where my body is. Hello? I want to report a crime. There is a girl who is missing, Fernanda Malta. Yes, Fernanda Malta. She was murdered. Her body is on Rua Siansi 71. ...the body of Fernanda Malta, of 18 years old, was found with signs of torture... Are you okay? ...at the location of Regi? dos Lagos. Two youngsters are suspected of the crime. For years, I helped as much as I could. One day... One day, I found the cleanest soul... ...and the blackest. Arthur. Good thing you have come. May I? Good evening. Stay relaxed. - Did you do what I said? - Yes. - Do you put the salt? - Yes. The salt... The salt is soothing. It prevents nothing from getting in- but it prevents it from getting out. If there is really something there with her. It is for your own good. I have a gift for your granddaughter. Can I give it to her? - Sure. - Excuse me. - May I sit down? - Yes. Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yes. Donna Clara, I mean, your Grandmother- -told me you were a very beautiful girl. And you are! But she did not say what your name is. - What's your name? - Michele. Michele. My name is Arthur. Okay? I have a gift for you. - You have to thank. - Thanks. It was a pleasure. - Do you like it? - Yes. Good. Have you thought of a name for her? Ana Maria. Michele. You know, Mom is sick, right? Well, Grandmother and I... ...will take care of her. - Okay? - Yes. Do you want me to say something to her? But I'll say something to you. When... when we're in there... ...in the room... ...and you hear some noise, anything... ...I want you to cover your ears like this. And shut your eyes tight. And only take your hands down and open your eyes when I come back. - Do we agree? - Agreed. Michele, tell me... What do you most enjoy doing with mom? What makes her laugh? When we... When we play in the garden. Then, it's that I want you to think about. When she laughs. Shall we go, Clara? She is no longer here. No? I'm so sorry. I went away. I burned down the house. But just like her mother, she was scarred. The time went by. She grew up... ...and he did not come. He did not come until now. Nobody came, Arthur. Only you came to this circus. Only you came. And to get in, you only need a ticket. The people... The people? I do not know what to say. You do not have to say anything. The truth is... ...that I'm no longer funny. Are you still my friend? Obviously. Do you remember the first time you came here? As if it were yesterday. You were afraid. You reminded me of my son. You never said you had a son. I did. But then you smiled. And I was sure that this day would come. It's as I thought. He is coming. He's almost here. Mallac... Do not say that name here. - When? - Now, when she's 20 years old. And there is nothing you can do? No, Arthur. I'm just an employee. I can do some things, but I can not change anything. I... I really hoped that this day would not come. Hope dies. But not the fate. Arthur. The body is perishable. The meat is nothing. The sacrifice is not so great. Look at me. You must not let him in. If he comes in... ...it's over. I will not allow that. But what should I do with myself? I know what you're thinking. And so? Do it, Arthur. This time you can. Because time it will not be in vain. But understand this: People who love each other do not always go to the same place. Sometimes they get lost and never meet again. I have no choice. I have never had. But do not use your own hands. It notices and destroys the person who took what he wanted. You will wake up and choose the right person. I's an evil person that deserves to suffer. Condemn him and send him to hell. Thanks to you, her soul has got peace. Yours... Yours will receive retribution. This is not about morality. It's a judgment. It will not be relevant- -but the password for the account- is zero, four... ...zero, five... ...Fifteen. Who is it? Pizza! - Who is it? - Your change. And Michele?
