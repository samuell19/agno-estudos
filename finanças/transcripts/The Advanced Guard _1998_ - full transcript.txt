HMM. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS GOOD. MMM. WANT SOME MORE? HMM. POLICE! OPEN THE DOOR! WE HAVE A WARRANT. BERNSTEIN, MOVE. DOWN THE STAIRS. GO! OH, MY GOD. THE REPORTS WERE ACCURATE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SHE TOLD US TO STAY. ARE YOU WITH ME? I DON'T KNOW HOW ONE OF THESE THINGS COULD GET COOKED UP WRONG. THIS IS YOUR FIRST HOP, ISN'T IT? YEAH. SO? SO, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET USED TO IT NOW. I WAS FIRST IN MY CLASS. WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU THINK I SHOULD GET USED TO? THEY'RE ALWAYS SENDING US OUT WITH SUBSTANDARD EQUIPMENT. NEVER TAKE THE TIME TO WORK THE KINKS OUT. I DON'T PLAN TO GO INTO THIS JOB SHORTHANDED, HARPER, SO YOU BETTER GET IT FIXED. I'LL FIX IT, BUT FIRST I HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT'S WRONG. WHOA! HEY! WHOA! YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE INSTITUTE. WELL, WELCOME TO GRADUATE STUDIES! HELP ME HOLD IT DOWN! YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THERE. THIS THING ISN'T WORKING. I'M GOING TO LET HIM VACATE UNTIL I CAN PUT HIS RIDE BACK UP. IT MAY NOT BE THAT SERIOUS. I THINK IT IS. WE'LL LET HIM BACK IN AS SOON AS I GET IT RIGHT. WE'RE ON A TIMELINE HERE. HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S MUCH EASIER NOW THAT IT STOPPED SHAKING AROUND. YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME GIVE IT A TRY? CHARLEY, STEP BACK. IN FACT, GET UP TO OPERATIONS AND RUN A SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC. WHY? EVERYTHING IS FINE. JUST FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS. YES, SIR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR FASCINATION WITH THESE THINGS. THEY'RE TOO HARD TO WORK WITH, THEY'RE TOO SMALL, AND THEY'RE UGLY. WELL, YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE THE DESIGN, THOUGH. WELL ORGANIZED. NOT MUCH WASTED MATERIAL. HMM. HOLD THIS. OH, HERE IT IS. GOT IT. FLUID INDUCER IS SEIZED. THAT'S ALL? YEP. OPERATOR ERROR. OPERATOR ERROR? I TOLD HIM TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW THIS WORKS. WELL, YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO HIM WHEN WE PUT HIM BACK IN. Alpha: CHARLEY, GET ON THE COM TO BRAVO. TELL HIM TO COME BACK DOWN. WE'VE GOT THIS THING UP AGAIN. YES, SIR, I'LL TELL HIM. BRAVO, BREAK'S OVER. THEY GOT YOUR RIDE GOING AGAIN. TIME TO QUIT YOUR LITTLE NAP. GET BACK TO WORK. BRAVO, WELCOME BACK. WHAT WAS THAT? OPERATOR ERROR. CROSS-COMMANDED SEIZURE. OH, NO, NO. I WAS WORKING IT RIGHT. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING IT RIGHT, BUT, AS USUAL, YOU WEREN'T. BRAVO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE EQUIPMENT BY NOW. I WAS SURE. GET UP. IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO RERACK. BUT DON'T THINK I'M FORGETTING THIS. YOU FIND SOME TIME TO STUDY YOUR TAPES. I STUDIED THE TAPES. ALL RIGHT, WHO'S FIRST? HARPER. THIS MISSION IS HER IDEA. I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE PLACING BLAME. I'M STATING A FACT. IF YOU BELIEVE WE'LL BE SUCCESSFUL... WHAT IF WE ARE? WHAT IF I'M RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT. BUT WHAT IF I AM? WE'LL ALL TAKE HOME BIG BONUSES AND FAST PROMOTIONS. YOUR EXPERIMENT WON'T WORK. THE SUBJECTS ARE UNSUITABLE. LEAN BACK. WELL, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG, AND I'M GOING TO PROVE IT. WELL, YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING. IT MAY BE YOUR EXPERIMENT, BUT YOU'RE UNDER MY COMMAND. UHH. YOU GETTING THAT? YES, SIR. HOW LONG ARE WE IN HERE? YOU'RE GETTING THE FULL HOUR'S CHARGE JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. THESE BODIES USE TOO MUCH POWER. THEY'RE INEFFICIENT. IT'S THE CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM. IT REQUIRES A LOT OF ENERGY. THE REAL ONES HAVE TO EAT 3 TIMES A DAY. LOWER LIFE FORMS. I DON'T KNOW. THEY REALLY SEEM TO ENJOY THEIR FOOD. Charley: HEY, HARPER, HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN THAT BODY? OVER A YEAR. YOU DIDN'T VACATE? NOT ONCE? NO. ALPHA THOUGHT I SHOULD STAY PUT. HE FELT I MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE READJUSTING IF I SPENT TIME OUT. ALPHA, YOU'RE A SADIST. EVERYONE NEEDS A HOBBY. HOW LONG TILL WE GET THERE? 20 HOURS. I LOVE NEW PLANETS. I'M SURE YOUR FEELINGS WON'T BE RECIPROCATED. OK, THIS IS IT--EARTH. PLANET MASS--3-17. HIGH ORBIT IN... 4 MINUTES. ARE THEY GOING TO DETECT US? NO. WE'LL REMAIN OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE AND BLEND IN WITH ALL THE JUNK THEY'VE GOT FLOATING AROUND UP HERE. WHAT'S THE POPULATION, HARPER? APPROXIMATELY 6 BILLION. JUST UNDER. 6 BILLION? QUITE A PRIZE, IF WE CAN MAKE IT WORK. THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION ISN'T VERY COOPERATIVE. YEAH, WELL, WE HAD BETTER MAKE IT WORK. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK FROM MY FIRST JOB WITH A ZERO RATING. PLANET FALL IS AT 600. PRIOR TO THIS, I WANT THE MEDICAL THEATER FULLY PREPPED. THIS PENETRATION WILL BE UNLIKE ANY OTHER. UNDERSTAND THAT THESE BEINGS ARE UNIQUELY RESISTANT TO US. ONLY ABOUT 10% ARE CONTROLLABLE. AS FAR AS WE KNOW. THERE MAY BE CONTROL TECHNIQUES I WASN'T ABLE TO PERFORM. THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE HERE TO FINISH WORK THAT HARPER WASN'T ABLE TO COMPLETE ON HER OWN. HOW LONG WAS THE FIRST STUDY? 6 MONTHS. I HEARD YOU WERE ALMOST CAUGHT. I WASN'T CAUGHT. I DID MY JOB. I BROUGHT BACK THE DATA. ALMOST, THOUGH. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THESE HUMANS ARE WORTH ANYTHING? BECAUSE THEY MAY LIVE LONGER. WELL, DOESN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO FIND A PLANET WITH A COMPLIANT POPULATION? HO HO. LISTEN TO THE NEW RECRUIT. SHE'S AN EXPERT NOW. MAYBE THE COUNCIL JUST WANTED TO SEND HER AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE. AH HA HA HA. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FUNNY? ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, QUIET. NOW LISTEN. IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT THE HUMAN POPULATION IS EXPENDABLE. THE FLEET'S BEEN ASSEMBLED AND IS ON ITS WAY, BUT THEY WON'T ARRIVE FOR ANOTHER 3 DAYS, AND HARPER HAS CONVINCED THE COUNCIL TO GIVE HER THAT TIME TO CONTINUE HER STUDY. MY JOB IS TO FACILITATE HARPER'S EXPERIMENT. BUT, UNDERSTAND, I HAVE BEEN GRANTED WIDE DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY IN THIS MATTER. WHAT ABOUT THE BONUS? YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THE BONUS? ONLY IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL. THE JOB IS TO COLLECT 3 HUMANS. WE NEED THESE SUBJECTS TO BE IMMUNE TO OUR CONTROL, AND WE NEED THEM ALIVE. WE'LL PUT THEM IN THE LAB AND SEE IF WE CAN OVERCOME THE MIND SHIELD. AND WHAT IF WE CAN'T MAKE THIS WORK? THEN IN 3 DAYS, WHEN THE FLEET ARRIVES, THEY'LL WIPE OUT THE HUMAN POPULATION AND STRIP THE PLANET. HEY, HARPER. HMM? HOW MANY HOPS YOU BEEN ON? THIS IS MY 22nd. 18 FIRST PENETRATIONS AND THEN FOLLOW-UPS. WHEW. THOSE ARE SOME LONG LOGS. YEAH. YEAH, I SPEND MONTHS STUDYING A CULTURE AND THEN MAKING ASSIMILATION TAPES FOR THE TROOPS. I STUDIED THE TAPES. I KNOW HOW TO ACT HUMAN. AND EVERY TIME OUT, I GET USED TO ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, AND THEN WE TAKE CONTROL, AND THEY BECOME EXTINCT BEFORE A YEAR IS PASSED. THAT'S PROGRESS. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A WASTE. JUST BE GLAD IT'S THEM GETTING WASTED, NOT US. I SUPPOSE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. I WANT MY BONUS, NEXT JOB, NEXT PAYDAY. ALL RIGHT, STEP IT UP. AND EVERYONE REMEMBER, YOU'RE TYING TO BLEND... IN. IT'S WHAT THEY WEAR. OK, I'M READY. LET'S GET GOING. ANY QUESTIONS? YEAH. IS THIS EARTH A RATHOLE? WAS THAT ON YOUR ASSIMILATION TAPE? YEAH. RATHOLE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS. WELL? "RAT"... IS... A DEROGATORY TERM FOR "JERK." CAN WE JUST GO? I'VE GOT A FIX ON THE BEACON THAT HARPER LEFT BEHIND. GOOD LUCK. HARPER, ARE YOU SURE YOU FOUND SOMEPLACE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE SEEN? I'M SURE. WHAT IS THIS PLACE? RATHOLE? IT'S A PRIVATE PLACE. GOD, IT SMELLS. IT'S A PRIVATE RATHOLE PLACE. COME ON. LEAD THE WAY. IT'S A LITTLE BETTER ONCE YOU GET OUT. YEAH. HE WANTED TO SEE A RATHOLE, WE SAW A RATHOLE. SO THIS IS IT? YUP. THIS IS THE PLACE. OUR OWN LITTLE PRIVATE HUNTING GROUND. WHAT'S IT CALLED? LOS ANGELES. IT MEANS CITY OF ANGELS. Bravo: WHAT ARE ANGELS? Harper: THEY'RE LIKE GHOSTS. OH. WHAT ARE GHOSTS? DEAD PEOPLE. AH. GOOD NAME. OH, COME ON, LET'S JUST GRAB A FEW HUMANS RIGHT HERE. NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD. IT'LL ATTRACT TOO MUCH ATTENTION. NAH, NAH, NAH. WATCH THIS, WATCH THIS, WATCH THIS. ALL RIGHT. OK. I GOT CONTROL OF THIS ONE. HOW MANY DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU GOT HIM? 7. YOU WANT TO WATCH HIM DANCE? RELEASE HIM. LET HIM GO. HE IS OF NO USE TO US. WE WANT NONCOMPLIANT HUMANS. WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR? THESE ARE NOT PLAYTHINGS FOR YOU TO TORTURE. SINCE WHEN? FOLLOW ME. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WHERE ARE WE GOING? WE'RE GOING TO A BAR. IT'S A PLACE WHERE HUMANS GO TO GET INTOXICATED. THE ONE WE'RE GOING TO IS VERY BUSY, BUT IT'S VERY NEAR PRIVACY. AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO COLLECT THESE HUMANS? THEY WILLINGLY IMPAIR THEIR OWN JUDGMENT AND THEN GO HOME WITH TOTAL STRANGERS. OH, IT CAN'T BE THAT EASY. YES, YES. THEY GO HOME WITH JUST ABOUT ANYONE. REALLY? HUH, YOU'RE GOOD. YEAH, WELL. I WORK ON IT. AHA. THERE'S ONE. WAIT A MINUTE, BRAVO. BE GENTLE. LET ME CHECK HIM OUT FIRST. THIS IS MY HOUSE. MY HOUSE! YOU'RE TRESPASSING! THIS ONE'S NO GOOD TO US. WHY NOT? BECAUSE HE'S DEAD. OH, MAN, BRAVO, BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY TO HIM, "BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME"? HE JUST KILLED A MAN. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE SO BREAKABLE. HE'S NOT BROKEN. HE'S DEAD. RELAX, HARPER. THERE'S MORE WHERE THIS ONE CAME FROM. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN MISTREAT THEM. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? HE WAS ALIVE, NOW HE'S DEAD. YEAH, IT'S FINE. WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE BACK, USE HIM AS A BIOLOGY SAMPLE. AHEM. DID YOU TRY PRESSURING HIS MIND FIRST? NO. UH-HUH. OK. BRAVO, NEXT TIME, BEFORE YOU BEAT SOMEONE UP, TRY WORKING HIS MIND. YOU SEE, WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH ONES WE CAN CONTROL AND WHICH ONES WE CAN'T. IT WAS ON THE TAPE. WHO'S NEXT? OH, WAIT. THAT WAS NOT ON THE TAPES. NO. WAIT. LET ME CARRY HIM. NOW THIS IS PERFECT. LOTS OF CHOICES. YEAH, BUT WE WANT THEM ALONE. WELL, THAT'S CHARLEY'S JOB-- INVEIGLEMENT. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? OH, YEAH. I GOT THESE PEOPLE DOWN. JUST WATCH ME. BRAVO. YEAH? TRY NOT TO KILL WHOEVER SHE BRINGS BACK. OHH. YOU CAN STAND HERE WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO, BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE YOU WON'T TRY TO PICK ME UP. OHH. NOW, DOES THAT LINE WORK WITH MOST WOMEN? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'M NEW IN TOWN. I'M JUST ROAD-TESTING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WELL, I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. ANOTHER LEMON, HUH? YEAH. THAT ONE'S PRETTY SOUR, TOO. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE A WALK? WELL, THERE YOU GO. OK. MY NAME'S DESMOND. NAME'S CHARLEY. NICE TO MEET YOU, DESMOND. NICE TO MEET YOU, CHARLEY. ACTUALLY, MY APARTMENT IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DRINK OR SOMETHING. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER JUST A LITTLE BIT? HELLO. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? IT'S ABOUT TIME. OH, YOU WANT TO PLAY? Harper: BRAVO. BRAVO, DON'T HURT HIM. HE'S TRYING TO CUT ME! LET ME TRY TO CONTROL HIS MIND FIRST. OH, YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME? THIS ISN'T WORKING. HELP ME. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO ME? HE FEELS IT. YES, BUT IT ISN'T WORKING. HE'S DEFINITELY NONCOMPLIANT. BRAVO, TAKE HIM. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? HIT HIM! Harper: BRAVO! HE BETTER STILL BE WORKING. YOU SAID TAKE HIM! IS HE STILL FUNCTIONAL? YES. PUT HIM WITH THE DEAD ONE. Charley: THAT'S 2. BOTH MEN. THAT'S ONE. THE DEAD ONE DOESN'T COUNT. AND WE NEED FEMALES. OH, I CAN GET ONE. OHH. AHEM. UH... YOU KNOW, I LIVE RIGHT OVER THERE. EXCUSE ME? I--I LIVE J-J-- RIGHT OVER THERE. SO? SO, DON'T YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME NOW? OH, WHAT A JERK. DIDN'T WORK TOO WELL. AHEM. HMM. MAYBE THE WOMEN AREN'T AS EASY AS THE MEN. I THINK WE SHOULD FIND A HUMAN WE CAN CONTROL. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. SO, MAYBE WE SHOULD EXPAND OUR OBJECTIVES A LITTLE. IT WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING TO COMPARE THE OTHERS TO. MAYBE. OK, LET'S KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR A COMPLIANT ONE. I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING, BUT WE'RE SURE TO FIND A HUMAN AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. WAIT. ARE YOU GONNA BE WARM ENOUGH? OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, BABY. I'LL BE FINE. WELL, IF WE MOVED IN TOGETHER, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT WITHOUT A SWEATER. ALL YOUR CLOTHES WOULD BE RIGHT AT HAND. LISTEN TO YOU. YOU'RE MOVING AWFUL FAST. THIS IS ONLY OUR SECOND DATE. I MOVE FAST? YOU LISTEN TO ME, MR. WANDERING HANDS, I THINK WE'VE SORT OF SKIPPED OVER THE STANDARD COURTSHIP RITUALS. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. OK. RIGHT NOW, I'VE GOT TO GO. YOU TAKE CARE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. AHH. MAN. DON'T EVEN TELL ME. DON'T THEY HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL COURTESY IN THIS CITY? IS THERE SOMETHING THE MATTER? THE MATTER? YEAH, THE MATTER IS THAT THERE'S NO RESPECT FOR A MAN'S PROFESSION, THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER. I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW YOU. I'M A PUBLIC SERVANT. I PROTECT PEOPLE'S PROPERTY FROM THEFT, VANDALISM. I USED TO BE A COP. WELL, I'M RETIRED NOW. LOOK, THEY'VE IMMOBILIZED MY CAR. HEY, HEY. BACK OFF. WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE? WHAT DO YOU WANT? CAR WON'T GO? IT GOES NOW. HOLY MOTHER OF-- HUH? A BIG ONE. PIECE OF JUNK. YOU DID THAT JUST TO SPITE ME. OK, I DON'T NEED A HUNDRED DOLLARS. 40 WILL DO. OH, NO. HERE. I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS MUGGED AT THE-- M-MY... YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT ME, ARE YOU? WE WON'T HURT YOU. HERE. THIS IS EVERYTHING. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE. YOU HAVE MY MONEY. I MEAN, ALL MY MONEY. WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY OR YOUR CAR. WE JUST WANT YOU. AAH! HEY! HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY! LET HER GO! COME HERE. CAN I KILL HIM? NO. YES! WE DON'T NEED HIM. DO IT, BRAVO! HE'S HARMLESS. DO IT! WAIT! JUST WAIT A MOMENT. YOU OK? UH... WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING? THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. LET THE LADY GO. DO NOT KILL HIM. JUST GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY. ALL RIGHT. I SAID LET THE LADY GO. BRAVO, WAIT. NOW, IS SHE YOUR WIFE OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR SOMETHING? NO. NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE IN MY LIFE. THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WALK AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN. AAH! LET'S TAKE THIS ONE ALSO. NO! WE DON'T NEED HIM. HE'S DISRUPTIVE. HE'S DIFFERENT. SO? HE RISKED HIS LIFE FOR A TOTAL STRANGER. MAYBE WE COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM HIM. WHY'D YOU HELP ME? I DON'T KNOW. IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WASN'T MUCH HELP, THOUGH, WAS I? THANKS. I'M NOT USED TO CHIVALRY. MOST GUYS I KNOW ARE... BUGS. I'M KEVIN. LAURA. HI. WHERE ARE WE? THOSE PEOPLE... HOW DID WE GET HERE? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN THEY BROUGHT US HERE. WHO ARE YOU? UHH... I'M KEVIN. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW, JACK. NAME'S DESMOND. YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH THE DOOR, DESMOND? OHH. WHAT'S YOUR STORY? UH...I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE. NEXT THING I KNOW, I WOKE UP HERE. NAME'S FRED. YOU LET THEM GET YOUR GUN, FRED. AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO USE THAT RATHER THAN LOSE IT? MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE. OH, NOW, YOU SEE, I WAS ASSUMING THAT DOOR WAS LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE. WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE VENT? OH, HEY. MAYBE WE CAN GET THIS OPEN. THEY FORGOT TO SEARCH ME. WELL, PRAISE JESUS. WE'RE LOCKED UP WITH A REGULAR BOY SCOUT. HEY, DON'T USE THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN. Laura: I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO IN THERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOES. LAURA, THIS MAY BE A WAY OUT. WE GOT TO TAKE IT, OK? WHATEVER'S OUT THERE, WE'LL DEAL WITH IT. YOU SEE ANYTHING UP THERE? YEAH, MAYBE. I SEE A HALLWAY. EMPTY. NOTHING ABOUT. Laura: QUIET. DON'T LET ANYBODY HEAR US. RELAX, LITTLE LADY. AIN'T NOTHING OUT HERE. IS THAT THE WAY OUT? ARE WE FREE? COME ON. THESE HUMANS ARE FEEBLE. THEY ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE'D LET THEM ESCAPE. THEY DO THIS VERY SAME TEST ON EARTH. THEY PUT MICE IN A WOODEN MAZE AND STUDY THEIR REACTIONS. IS YOUR STUDY GRANTING US ANY PROGRESS HERE OR NOT? YES. THE TEST IS PROVOKING A VARIETY OF RESPONSES. PUZZLEMENT, SUSPICION, HOPE. AND EACH RESPONSE PROVIDES US WITH A POSSIBLE OPENING INTO THEIR MINDS. DOES IT, REALLY? HAVE YOU MADE MEASURABLE GAINS? CAN YOU CONTROL THEIR ACTIONS, READ THEIR THOUGHTS? CAN YOU INVADE THEIR MINDS AT ALL? NO. NOT YET. THEN AS I EXPECTED, THIS EXERCISE HAS NOT BEEN PRODUCTIVE. WAIT. THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER BIG REACTION IN A MOMENT. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? IT CAN'T BE REAL. Laura: OH, MY GOD. THEY'RE GONNA KILL US ALL. WE'RE GONNA DIE. Kevin: NO, WE'RE NOT. Laura: WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE. Desmond: THIS CAN'T BE. SOMEBODY'S SCREWING WITH US. I'M NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THEM. THIS ISN'T WORKING, IS IT? NO, BUT WE'VE JUST BEGUN. I TOLD YOU IT WAS GOING TO BE AN EXTENDED PROCESS. OUR TIME IS LIMITED, AND MY PATIENCE IS SHORT. I THINK WE'D BE BETTER OFF IN THE LAB. WE SHOULD DISSECT THEM. NO. WE NEED TO MOVE DELIBERATELY, LOOK CAREFULLY FOR THEIR VULNERABILITIES. THEY'RE TOO VALUABLE TO WASTE. OK, STEP BACK. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? NO, BRAVO. LET HIM KEEP IT, IF IT GIVES HIM SOME COMFORT. THEY ARE NO THREAT TO US. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT IS THIS? EVERYTHING IS AS IT SEEMS TO BE. THE HELL IT IS. THIS IS A TRICK. NO TRICK. YOU FOUR WILL BEHAVE YOURSELVES. YOU WILL DO AS YOU'RE COMMANDED BY US UNLESS YOU WISH TO JOIN YOUR UNFORTUNATE FRIEND. IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL US, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT? GET IT OVER WITH. I AIN'T IN THE MOOD FOR PLAYING GAMES. WE'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES. WE'RE STUDYING. WE'RE INTERESTED IN HUMANS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUMANS? USE YOUR IMAGINATION. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LEARN A DAMN THING FROM ME, SO JUST GO AHEAD AND PUT ME ON A PLATE. DO IT. I HATE WASTING TIME. YOU TELL ME IF I'M GONNA HAVE TROUBLE GETTING COOPERATION. IS THIS A RAY GUN? AM I SUPPOSED TO BE SCARED NOW? YOU WILL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD... OR YOU WILL DIE. TAKE IT EASY, BRAVO. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. SO? SO BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL. I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL. THEY'RE FRAGILE. I WANT THEM TAKEN CARE OF. SORRY. HA HA. I JUST BET YOU ARE, SPACEMAN. BRAVO. WE CAN'T JUST LET THEM KEEP US CAGED UP. WELL, YOU GOT ANY MORE GOOD IDEAS? NO. BUT WE GOT TO THINK. I MEAN, WE CAN'T JUST ACCEPT WHATEVER THEY THROW AT US. ALL RIGHT, WHY WOULD THEY KEEP US PENNED UP HERE? THEY MUST NEED SOMETHING FROM US. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS. Kevin: WE GOT TO FIND THEIR WEAKNESS AND EXPLOIT IT. MAYBE THIS WILL LEAD OUT AGAIN. WELL, THEY ARE EFFICIENT BASTARDS. I'LL GIVE THEM THAT. Alpha: WHAT'S YOUR NEXT TEST? I'M GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE COMPLIANT HUMAN AND USE HIM TO-- THAT WAS MY IDEA. I SAID WE SHOULD BRING ONE WE CAN CONTROL. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD JUST STOP WASTING TIME. WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID BY THE DAY HERE. LET'S JUST TAKE ONE WE CAN CONTROL, ONE WE CAN'T, OPEN UP THEIR BRAINS, AND LOOK FOR THE DIFFERENCES. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'LL GET AN ANSWER THAT WAY. I DO KNOW IT'LL BE FASTER THAN YOUR REACTION TESTING. AND IF IT'S INCONCLUSIVE, WE'LL HAVE FEWER SUBJECTS TO TEST AND THE CLOCK RUNNING OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED FROM. WE ONLY HAVE ONE COMPLIANT. WE NEED HIM FOR THIS EXPERIMENT. FINE, HARPER, AMUSE YOURSELF WITH YOUR EXPERIMENT, BUT REMEMBER, YOU HAVE 2 DAYS BEFORE THE FLEET ARRIVES. YOU'LL GET RESULTS NOW OR DECIDE THAT YOU CANNOT. AHEM. THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT, AS I'VE SAID, IS WITH THE COMPLIANT HUMAN. YOU'RE THE REASON THEY PUT US HERE. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? YOU SCREAMED, THEY CAME, HERE WE ARE. LEAVE HER ALONE, FRED. THIS ISN'T HER FAULT. THE ESCAPE WAS THEIR TRICK. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT? HE MAY BE JUST ABOUT RIGHT. Kevin: HE'S NOT RIGHT. MAYBE IT'S YOU. YOU BACKED OFF PRETTY FAST WHEN THEY PRESSURED YOU. IS THERE SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU, SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US THERE, MR. BOY SCOUT? HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THINKING FOR YOURSELF? YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. IT'S THE GIRL. HE'S PROTECTING THE GIRL. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, I AM, AND I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE HER ALONE. AND I TOLD YOU TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT ON OUR SIDE. I WOKE UP, YOU WERE STANDING HERE. I DON'T KNOW YOU. MAYBE WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME SIDE AT ALL. ARE YOU ALWAYS AN IDIOT, OR ARE YOU JUST SLEEPY THIS MORNING? Alpha: FINALLY, A LITTLE ACTION. HAVE THEIR MINDS OPENED UP? Harper: NO, NOT YET. BUT LOOK AT THEM. MAYBE WE DON'T NEED TO CONTROL ALL OF THEM. MAYBE ALL WE NEED TO DO IS CONTROL A FEW AND MANIPULATE THE REST. WE NEED SLAVES, NOT A COMMITTEE. STOP! STOP IT! CUT IT OUT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT? WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY. WE'RE-- SHE'S RIGHT. SHE IS. YEAH. SORRY. SO MUCH FOR MANIPULATION. IMPRESSIVE, THOUGH, THE WAY THEY PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE. I'M NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. I SEE WE HAVE NOTHING. NO PROGRESS. NONE. CAN'T WE JUST FORCE THE OLD ONE TO TELL US HOW TO KEEP THIS UP? HE DOESN'T KNOW. THEY HAVE NO CONCEPT OF MENTAL CONTROL, OURS OR THEIRS. SEEMS TO BE AN ACCIDENT OF NATURE. HARPER, IF IT'S COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS, HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO BREAK THEM? OUR NEXT STEP IS TO TRY CHEMICALS ON A PAIR OF THEM. OK, HARPER, YOU GO AHEAD AND TEST YOUR HALLUCINOGENS, BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T DISSECT THE OTHER 2. ONE COMPLIANT, ONE NONCOMPLIANT. SHE DOESN'T NEED ALL 4. WE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE A COUPLE. I THINK CHARLEY HAS THE RIGHT IDEA. I DON'T THINK SO, NO. I THINK CHARLEY IS LOOKING FOR SINGULAR GLORY ON HER FIRST MISSION. NO NEED TO WORRY ON THAT ACCOUNT. CHARLEY, YOU'RE GOING TO CONDUCT HARPER'S CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT. THIS IS MY EXPERIMENT! AND I'M IN CHARGE HERE. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A COMMAND WITH THE FLEET, BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO BABY-SIT YOU, SO IF I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS POINTLESS EXERCISE, I CAN DAMN WELL DIRECT IT AS I CHOOSE. NOW YOU GET THE COMPLIANT HUMAN OUT OF THERE. LET'S PUT HIM ON A SLAB, OPEN UP HIS SKULL, AND SEE WHAT MAKES HIS BRAIN WORK. ALL RIGHT, COME ON OUT OF THERE. FRED! FRED, CAN YOU HEAR ME?! FRED! GET OUT OF THE WAY. NO. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? ARE YOU SOME SORT OF A FOOL? I DON'T THINK SO, NO. SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH? IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SCARE ME INTO SUBMISSION, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. YOU MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE, BUT WE'RE NOT TOTALLY HOPELESS. AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION. WE'RE HERE TO TAKE WHAT WE WANT, AND THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS HOPE FOR A LITTLE MERCY. NOW STAND ASIDE. NO. TAKE ME. TAKE YOU? YEAH. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE MERCILESS, YOU MIGHT AS WELL PICK ON SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE NEXT. Harper: BRAVO. WHERE AM I? WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME? NOTHING...YET. GIVE ME A MOMENT. HOW DO YOU GET ME TO DO THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO? LET'S FIND OUT, SHALL WE? THAT WILL KILL HIM. OF COURSE. THAT'S PART OF THIS EXERCISE. DO YOU HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THAT? NO, I DON'T, BUT I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WE CAN EXAMINE HIM INTRACRANIALLY WITHOUT ENDING HIS LIFE. WHY SHOULD HIS LIFE BE OF CONCERN TO US? ALPHA, THE LONGER WE KEEP THEM ALIVE, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO LEARN FROM THEM. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? THIS WILL TAKE LONGER. IT'S PAINFUL, BUT IT WON'T KILL HIM. UHH! AAH! AAH! FINE. DO THIS ONE FIRST, THEN A NONCOMPLIANT-- THE ONE THAT THINKS HE'S A HERO. WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THE BIG ONE, PUT HIM SOMEPLACE. ANYPLACE, SOMEPLACE WE CAN GET AT HIM. KEEP ME INFORMED. WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE, I'M GONNA OPEN YOU UP LIKE A CAN OF PEACHES. YOU'RE NEVER GETTING OUT OF HERE. AAH! WE'LL USE SOMETHING FAR MORE POTENT ON THE GIRL. HARPER'S CHEMICALS ARE TOO MILD. GET AWAY. UNH! UHH! IT BURNS! GOOD. NOW WE'LL LEAVE HER LIKE THIS, LET HER BODY GET USED TO IT. THIS IS GOING TO BE PAINFUL. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ANESTHETIC. I...I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I COULD SAVE YOUR LIVES. AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY THANK YOU? NO. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY WHAT YOU'RE DOING? I DON'T NEED TO JUSTIFY MYSELF TO YOU. NO, JUST TO YOURSELF. THIS IS HOW WE SURVIVE. BY TORTURE? WE NEED TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GROWING POPULATION. WE NEED PRODUCTS, RESOURCES, LABORERS. SO YOU'RE HERE TO TAKE THE PLANET? YES. YOU DON'T CARE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US? I TOLD YOU, THIS IS HOW WE SURVIVE. HMM. OUR HISTORY'S FULL OF PEOPLE WHO USE THAT EXCUSE FOR ANY NUMBER OF ATROCITIES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THESE PEOPLE MET THEIR FATE BY THE SAME MEANS THEY USED ON OTHERS. NO. NO, SOME OF THEM PROSPERED QUITE WELL. IT DIDN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. I'M SORRY. THIS IS THE BEST I CAN DO. HOLD STILL. CAN THEY HEAR US? I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU FREAK. ARE YOU DONE POISONING ME? HAVE YOU HAD YOUR FUN YET? YEAH, HE CAN HEAR US. ALL RIGHT. TRY A SIMPLE COMMAND. TRY GETTING HIM TO LIFT HIS ARM. HELLO. CAN I GO BACK TO MY CELL NOW? THIS ONE'S USELESS. LET'S TRY THE OTHER ONE. AS BEFORE, WE ARE GETTING NOWHERE. WILL THE DRUGS WEAR OFF? YEAH. THEY'LL BE BACK TO NORMAL IN A FEW HOURS. I FIND NO RELEVANT STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE 2 BRAINS. THIS IS NOT HELPFUL. WE MAY HAVE LEARNED MORE IF SHE HAD DISSECTED THEM PROPERLY. NO. THEY WOULD BE DEAD, AND WE STILL WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING NOW, AND MY PATIENCE FOR THIS IS AT AN END. IT'S TIME WE TERMINATED THE TEST. BUT I STILL HAVE A DAY. A DAY AND A HALF. AND WE MAY STILL GAIN INFORMATION THROUGH REACTION TESTING. MAYBE HARPER'S RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU AGREE WITH HER NOW? NO, NO, BUT I DO HAVE AN IDEA FOR A REACTION TEST. IT WOULD TAKE SOME CONSTRUCTION, BUT WE MAY FIND OUT THEIR REACTION TO THE THREAT OF IMMINENT DEATH. ALL RIGHT, HARPER, PASS ME THE NEXT ONE. I WISH WE COULD JUST GET THIS OVER WITH. THEY SHOULD JUST KILL US. COME ON, DON'T SAY THAT. OH, I'M SORRY... BUT THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL. I WONDER WHY THEY HAVEN'T. WELL, THEY WANT SOMETHING FROM US, OTHERWISE THEY WOULD. BUT WHAT DO THEY WANT? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER. HOW'S THAT? WELL, WHATEVER THE REASON, WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT READY TO KILL US. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. WELL, WE'RE GONNA ASSUME. SO WHAT IF WE DO? SO, WE, UH...WE LURE ONE OF THEM IN HERE. GET THEM TO THINK ONE OF US IS SICK OR, UH, DYING OR SOMETHING. GET THEM TO UNLOCK THIS DOOR. THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. IT'S A TELEVISION TRICK. I DON'T THINK THEY GET TELEVISION. THEY'LL BELIEVE IT, WE'LL MAKE IT BELIEVABLE, WHAT THEN? AH, WELL, THEN, UM... YOU KNOW, TWO OF US GET OUT AND LOCK THE DOOR. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO WHOEVER IS LEFT IN HERE WITH THE BAD GUY? WELL, HE SHOULD BE SAFE, BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, THEY DON'T SEEM READY TO KILL US YET. MAYBE. MAYBE. SO THEN THE TWO WHO ESCAPE GET A WEAPON AND COME BACK AND, UH... SAVE THE GUY WHO'S STILL IN THE CELL, AND THEN WE ESCAPE AGAIN. THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AWFUL RISK. WELL, SURE AS HELL BEATS SITTING HERE. I'LL DO IT. I'LL BE THE DIVERSION. ARE YOU SURE? YUP. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TAKE A PIECE OUT OF ONE OF THEM FOR A WHILE NOW. THIS DEVICE ISN'T GOING TO THREATEN DEATH. IT'S--IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO KILL ONE OF THEM. OF COURSE IT IS. YEAH, SO WHAT? WE HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THEM SO FAR. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE? THEY'RE GOING TO DIE ANYWAY. SIR, MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH THESE PEOPLE? NOW, IF WE CAN'T CONTROL THEM, PERHAPS WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM. MAYBE WE SHOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THEM. PERHAPS IT WOULD SERVE US BETTER TO OPEN TRADE TALKS. WE NEED SLAVES, NOT PARTNERS. BUT EVERY RACE THAT WE'VE SUBJUGATED HAS DIED OUT ON US. NOW, WHAT GOOD HAS IT DONE US? WE USE THEM FOR A YEAR, IF WE'RE LUCKY, AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND NEW. IF WE COULD-- ENOUGH! THIS IS HOW WE SURVIVE. YOU KNOW THIS. I NEED NOT EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. IF IT IS THEIR FATE TO DIE OFF AS A RACE, THEN THAT IS AS IT WILL BE. DON'T TELL ME YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO PRACTICE DIPLOMACY. AND I, FOR ONE, WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE AN END OF THEM. THEY'RE TROUBLE. YOU WANT TO HAND ME YOUR KNIFE THERE, SCOUT BOY? HERE YOU GO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'LL MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT CONVINCING. Laura: OH, MY GOD. GOD, DESMOND, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? WE NEED THEM TO THINK THIS IS LIFE-THREATENING. AW, MAN. NOW CALL OUT. TELL THEM I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF. OK. HELP! HELP US, PLEASE, HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP US! HELP US, PLEASE! HELP! SHUT UP! Laura: HELP US! HELP! WE NEED YOUR HELP HERE, PLEASE! PLEASE, OUR FRIEND IS DYING! HEY! WHAT'S ALL THE NOISE FOR? UH, OUR FRIEND TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF. YOU GOT TO HELP HIM. SO WHAT? THEN HE DIES. YOU CAN'T LET HIM DIE! WHY NOT? BECAUSE YOU NEED HIM FOR, UM... YOU CAN'T LET HIM BLEED TO DEATH! ALPHA. Alpha: WHAT IS IT, BRAVO? AW, ONE OF THE HUMANS IS DYING. WE GOT TO GET ANOTHER ONE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? WAIT. DON'T DO ANYTHING. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. OPEN IT UP. DON'T ANYONE MOVE... NOT...A FINGER. GET HIM OUT OF THERE. ARE YOU PLAYING GAMES WITH ME? VERY WELL. BRAVO, DRAG HIM OUT OF THERE. NOW, YOU TWO BEHAVE YOURSELVES. YOU READY? I DON'T KNOW. LAST TIME WE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR. LAST TIME WAS THEIR TRAP. THIS TIME IT'S OUR IDEA. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? HOW ARE WE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, THEY'RE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY SEEM. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND, SO MAYBE THAT'S THEIR WEAKNESS. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW, BUT IT BEATS SITTING IN OUR CELL. WHICH WAY? UH...YOUR PICK. THIS IS NOT A LIFE-THREATENING INJURY. MAYBE NOT, BUT IT SURE HURT LIKE HELL. HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE? NO. NO, NOT A CHANCE. THE BLOOD MAKES IT LOOK MUCH WORSE THAN IT IS-- THOUGH I'M SURPRISED HE WOULD DO THIS TO HIMSELF. HE TRICKED US. WHY? HA. JUST TO SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE. REPAIR THE WOUND. WE NEED HIM IN REASONABLE SHAPE FOR CHARLEY'S TEST. WHAT'S IN HERE? LET'S FIND OUT. Laura: WHAT IS IT? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S, UH... I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SAFE PLACE. IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED TO FIND? MAYBE. WHAT ARE THEY? I DON'T KNOW, BUT, UH, WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY'RE NOT ON OUR SIDE. ARE THEY ALIVE? YEAH, THEY ARE. THIS IS THEIR SECRET, LAURA. THIS IS THEM. THESE ARE THEIR REAL BODIES. THEY'RE NOT HUMAN. THIS IS WHAT THEY REALLY LOOK LIKE. AND IF WE CAN DESTROY THEM... OH, CRAP. OK, LOOK AROUND. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO OPEN THESE THINGS BACK UP. THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING SOON. OK, WELL, HURRY. DO AS YOU'RE COMMANDED! WHAT'S THE COMMAND? YOU SHOULD HEAR IT IN YOUR HEAD! WELL, I DON'T. EVERY RACE CAN HEAR OUR COMMANDS. SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU. BRAVO, PUT HIM DOWN. VERY CLEVER. THIS IS WHY YOU TRICKED US. HOW DID YOU GET OUT? WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU CAN'T READ MY MIND? YES, I CAN. YOU'RE THINKING IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO PROVOKE ME. TAKE THEM BACK TO THEIR CELL. OH! UNH. OH, I GUESS THAT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. WE'RE GONNA DIE HERE. I TOLD YOU. WE'RE GONNA DIE HERE. NO, WE'RE NOT. LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA BE OK. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT. NO, IT'S TRUE. IT IS. LISTEN, EVERY TIME WE INTERACT WITH THEM, WE LEARN SOMETHING. THEY CAN'T EXACTLY SAY THE SAME THING OF US. WE KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY LOOK LIKE, WE KNOW WHERE THEY HIDE. EVENTUALLY, WE'RE GONNA LEARN SOME IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE ADVANTAGE. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE? 'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA LET IT HAPPEN. YOU WANNA HEAR ABOUT THE FIRST TIME I EVER KISSED A GIRL? YEAH. YEAH? OK. AHEM. 'CAUSE I REMEMBER THINKING THAT MY LIFE WOULD BE FOREVER DIFFERENT. I WAS 11 AT THE TIME. Laura: WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS 11, LIKE I SAID, SO, UH, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT WAS... WITH GIRLS. YOU KNOW. OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T. YEAH, BUT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW. ANYWAY... HER NAME WAS TIA, AND SHE WAS 13. UH-HUH. AND SHE KISSED ME WHEN HER PARENTS WERE AT A MEETING OF THE PTA. YEAH? MMM. THEN SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A BATH WITH HER. DID SHE NOW? MM-HMM. AND SO I SAID, "OK." OF COURSE. SO I SKINNED OFF MY SHORTS, AND I JUMPED IN THE TUB, AND THEN SHE TOOK OFF ALL OF HER CLOTHES, AND, WELL, WHEN I GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HER, I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT I... I PEED... A LITTLE YELLOW ARC ACROSS THE TOP OF THE WATER. YOU DIDN'T. I DID. AND LET ME TELL YOU, MY LOOK ON LIFE HAS NEVER QUITE BEEN THE SAME. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE? I'M WORKING. YOU STUDYING YOUR PRECIOUS HUMANS? WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT MEANS YOU'RE SOFT ON THEM, AND YOU DEFEND THEM AT EVERY TURN. I DON'T DEFEND THEM. I'M TRYING TO FIND A WORKABLE SOLUTION. YEAH, AND EVERY TIME I MAKE A SUGGESTION, YOU'RE IN MY WAY. THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR SUGGESTIONS ARE MALICIOUS AND UNPRODUCTIVE. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. YES, I KNOW. NO, YOU DON'T. NO, I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE. YOU ADMIRE THEM. OR SHOULD I SAY, YOU ADMIRE ONE IN PARTICULAR. YOUR ACCUSATIONS MEAN NOTHING TO ME. ALL YOU WANT IS YOUR PRECIOUS BONUS. YOU DON'T CARE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING ANY BETTER FOR US THAN IT IS FOR THEM. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU THAT WE REPEAT THE SAME POINTLESS CYCLE AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO DESTROY EVERY RACE WE FIND EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY GET ONE YEAR OF USE FROM EACH. WHEN DID YOU BECOME SUCH A HUMANIST? I'M NOT. I JUST CAN'T STAND TO SEE US WASTE EVERY RESOURCE WE FIND. Alpha: STOP THIS. STOP THIS, OR I WILL KILL YOU. THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KILL ME, 'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU TAKE HER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA KILL HIM. JUST GRAB HER. OOH! GO! OOH. WHERE'S LAURA? I DON'T KNOW. THEY TOOK HER. WHERE TO? LET ME SHOW YOU. LAURA. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, BUT I'M TRAPPED. HELP ME GET HER OUT. NO SENSE WASTING YOUR STRENGTH. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT. LET HER GO. TEMPER. I WOULDN'T WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT HER FREEDOM RIGHT NOW AS I'D WORRY ABOUT HER LIFE. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? IT'S WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO THAT SHOULD CONCERN YOU. KEVIN. IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD TAKE HOLD OF THOSE HANDLES, BECAUSE THAT PLATE'S GOING TO PROVE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HER VERY SOON. KEVIN... AAH. GET IT OFF OF ME! THAT'S RIGHT. NOW YOU'RE IN POSITION FOR THE TEST. ISN'T THIS FUN? REALLY A TERRIFIC IDEA, DON'T YOU THINK? HEY, STOP IT! THAT PLATE IS ELECTROMAGNETIC. AND EVERY FEW SECONDS, I'M GOING TO MAKE IT 20 POUNDS HEAVIER. I WANT TO SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN HOLD ON TO IT BEFORE YOU LET IT CRUSH THE GIRL. KEVIN, PLEASE. Kevin: DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT GONNA LET IT GO. STILL NOTHING. THEY'RE AS CLOSED OFF AS EVER. 300 POUNDS NOW. VERY GOOD. PERHAPS I SHOULD INCREASE THE WEIGHT IN BIGGER INCREMENTS. STOP IT! LET HER GO. NO. YOU'RE FEELING STRONG, RIGHT? YEAH, BUT MY HANDS ARE SLIPPING. NO, THEY'RE NOT. DON'T LET THEM SLIP. I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN HELP IT. DESMOND, PLEASE. I'M TRYING. KEVIN, I DON'T GOT IT. DESMOND. AAH. AAH! OH, MY GOD! ANYTHING? NO. NOTHING. THEY'RE STILL ALL IN CONTROL OF THEMSELVES. Alpha: ANOTHER FAILURE. Charley: WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO WITH THE BROKEN ONE? I SHOULD FIX HIM. NO, I WANT NO MORE OF THIS. YOUR EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN A TOTAL FAILURE, AND WE ARE FINISHED WITH THIS SPECIES. TERMINATE THE BROKEN MALE AND THE FEMALE AND PREP THEM FOR STORAGE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO FRED? HE SHOULDN'T BE YOUR CONCERN. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT I CAN FIX THIS. WHY DID YOU DO IT? I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE. YES, YOU DID. YOU COULD HAVE LET IT DROP. NO, I COULDN'T. BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THIS. WE'RE YOU REALLY WILLING TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CRIPPLED? IT WASN'T REALLY A MATTER OF BEING WILLING. YOU WERE GONNA CRUSH HER. I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT THIS OR THAT. I... IT WASN'T A RATIONAL CHOICE, IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT I HAD TO DO. WELL... YOU'RE VERY BRAVE. MMM. LOT A GOOD IT'S DONE ME. AAH. WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME? I GUESS BECAUSE CHARLEY'S RIGHT. I HAVE COME TO ADMIRE HUMANS. YOU'RE ALWAYS SEEING NEW CHALLENGES, CONSTANTLY REINVENTING YOURSELVES. I HATE TO SEE THAT WASTED. THAT SHOULD SIT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. IT'S GOING TO BE SORE FOR A WHILE. IN THE LAB... THOSE, UH, CREATURES... THEY'RE YOU? YES. THIS BODY IS...HMMPH. THIS BODY IS ARTIFICIAL. IT RUNS ON ELECTRICITY. WE HAVE TO RECHARGE DAILY-- SOMETIMES MORE IF WE EXPEND TOO MUCH ENERGY. SO YOU DON'T EAT... EVEN IN YOUR OTHER FORM? NO. NO, OUR NATURAL BODIES GET ENERGY FROM HEAT AND LIGHT. I SAW PEOPLE ON EARTH EATING, THOUGH. AND I TRIED IT ONCE. IT WAS WONDERFUL. MMM. CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT FOOD, 'CAUSE I'M STARVING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHAT? IT'S MY FAULT. THIS EXPERIMENT AND EVERYTHING. I WAS THE FIRST TO SCOUT YOUR PLANET. I BROUGHT BACK THE FIRST REPORT. AND I BROUGHT THIS TEAM HERE. CAN YOU MAKE THEM ALL GO AWAY? NO. YOU CALLED. WHAT IS IT? WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE GIRL. YOU WHAT? SHE'S RESPONDING TO OUR MENTAL COMMANDS NOW. WATCH. Alpha: SHE'S COMPLETELY IN LINE. BUT HOW IS THIS? I TOLD YOU TRY MY EXPERIMENT. NOW YOU SEE IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE SUCCESS. NO, IT HAS NOT. WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE ACHIEVED THIS, THEREFORE NO IDEA HOW TO DUPLICATE IT. WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE WE DO, STRAP DOWN THE ENTIRE POPULATION ONE AT A TIME? IF WE CANNOT DUPLICATE THIS EFFECT EASILY, IT IS NO GOOD TO US. MAYBE WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS ONE THAT WASN'T APPARENT IN THE OTHERS. I THINK WE SHOULD DO A DISSECTION RIGHT AWAY. AGREED. WE NEED TO LOOK AT SLIDES. CHARLEY, TAKE THE FEMALE TO THE LAB AND DISSECT. HARPER, YOU STILL HAVE A BODY IN THE INFIRMARY. OPEN IT UP. MAYBE WE CAN STILL LEARN SOMETHING. BUT, SIR... POWER-UP IS IN AN HOUR. WE'LL RECHARGE BEFORE THE FLEET ARRIVES, AND THEN FINISH OUR REPORT BY STUDYING THE BRAINS PIECE BY PIECE. HOW'S THE LEG? UH, I DON'T KNOW. BETTER, I THINK. CAN YOU WALK? I--I DON'T KNOW. LET'S TRY. I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE. WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE CHANCE. COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? I CAN ONLY HELP YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE? THEY'RE RECHARGING. WE HAVE SOME TIME. COME ON. SO WILL YOU DIE IF YOU DON'T RECHARGE? NO. NO, OUR MINDS OUR DIFFERENT. THEY'RE NOT LOCKED IN THE WAY YOURS ARE. IF WE DIDN'T RECHARGE, WE COULD JUST GO BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL BODIES. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO ESCAPE, YOU NEED TO DO IT NOW. I SAID I WASN'T GONNA LEAVE WITHOUT THEM. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, YOU GO COLLECT THE ONE IN THE CELL, THE OTHERS ARE STILL UNDER OUR CONTROL. AFTER I'VE RECHARGED, I'LL SEND THEM. NO, SEND THEM NOW. I CAN'T. I NEED TO RECHARGE. I DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO-- ALL RIGHT. YOU ESCAPE FIRST... I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO WORK THE TRANSPORTATION DEVICE. WHEN I'VE RECHARGED, AND YOUR ESCAPE IS DISCOVERED, I'LL SEND THE OTHERS WHILE MY COMPANIONS ARE SEARCHING FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME. WHAT WAS THAT FOR? JUST SOMETHING I WANTED TO TRY. COME ON. HEY. WHERE THE HELL DID YOU COME FROM? IT'S A LONG STORY. WHERE'S LAURA? THEY TOOK HER. SHE'S LIKE FRED NOW. SHE'S DOING WHAT THEY SAY. LIKE FRED? THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. OK, WELL, COME ON, WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE. HOW WE GONNA DO THAT? OH, YEAH, WELL, HARPER LET ME GO. SHE TOLD ME HOW TO GET AWAY FROM... WHAT ABOUT THE GUARDS? THEY'RE HAVING BREAKFAST. IF YOU SAY SO. HEY, WHERE'D THEY TAKE LAURA? I DON'T KNOW. OK, WELL, WE GOTTA FIND HER. HARPER SAID SHE'D SEND THE OTHERS, BUT WHEN WE ESCAPE, THEY'LL KNOW SHE HELPED, SO WE GOTTA FIND EVERYBODY NOW. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL WE'RE DOING? WELL, I THINK SO. I MEAN, IT ALL KINDA LOOKS THE SAME. FRED. AW, DAMN IT. OK, FRED, NOW, YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT, BECAUSE, UH, YOU'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT, AND, UH, THEY GOT CONTROL OVER YOU. I HAVE TO TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR CELL. THEN WE GOT A PROBLEM, FREDERICK, 'CAUSE WE AIN'T GOING BACK. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, FRED. YOU GOTTA THINK, 'CAUSE IF WE GO BACK, THEY'RE GONNA KILL US. MOVE OUT. HE CAN'T GET US BOTH. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT TO ME. COME ON, FRED. COME ON, MAN. OHH... OH, G-GOD. YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO CONTROL MY THOUGHTS, AND I WAS GONNA SHOOT YOU. I REALLY WAS. I WAS GONNA SHOOT YOU. AND THEN I JUST COULDN'T. OH, MAN. OHH. I'M STILL TREMBLING. YEAH. YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU GONNA BE OK? UH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OK. LET'S GO FIND LAURA. YEAH. MAN. OHH, MAN. WHAT'S WRONG? I LOST MY LINK WITH THE HUMAN. HOW? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS THE FINAL PROOF OF YOUR MISTAKE. YOU WERE WRONG ALL ALONG. THIS PROVES THAT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THEM IS LIMITED. I WILL CALL THE FLEET, TELL THEM OF YOUR FAILURE, AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE LAST OF THE HUMANS. PRACTICE SOME OF OUR NEW DIPLOMACY. ANNIHILATE THEM. OK, WHAT'S THE PLAN? WELL, WE GOTTA FIND LAURA. THEN, UM, I'M STILL WORKING ON IT. YOU BETTER WORK FAST. I THOUGHT I'D SEE YOU FOR THE LAST TIME. DON'T SHOOT. SHE'S A FRIEND. WHY HAVEN'T YOU ESCAPED? AND YOU... HOW IS IT YOU REGAINED YOUR SELF-CONTROL? I HAVE NO CLUE. HOW DID YOU GET CONTROL OF HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE? WE DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY GONE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER HUMANS? I'M BLACK. GOTTA BE SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN THAT. IF YOU WERE BLACK, YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO. HMM. WE WERE SEARCHING FOR A SPECIFIC MENTAL STATE. WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN YOU WERE TAKEN? IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I WAS VISITING A LADY FRIEND. LOVE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T THOUGHT OF. AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN YOU REGAINED YOUR SELF-CONTROL? I WAS ANGRY. SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO MAKE ME DO SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ME, AND I WAS ANGRY. HE WAS TREMBLING, HE WAS SHAKING. HEY. HE GOT A SHOT FROM HIS ADRENAL GLAND. IT'S ADRENALINE. THAT COULD BE IT. AND IS THERE SOME SORT OF CHEMICAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONSET OF AFFECTION OR AROUSAL? PHEROMONES. PHEROMONES, SO MAYBE IT'S NOT LOVE. IT COULD BE A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL OR HORMONAL STATE. YES, AND A VIOLENT EMOTION BREAKS THE CONTROL WITH ADRENALINE. THAT'S IT! OH, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD YOU AS SLAVES. OUR CONTROL WOULD BE MUCH TOO UNSTABLE. THAT EXPLAINS FRED, BUT WHAT ABOUT LAURA? I MEAN, WHO'S SHE IN LOVE WITH? DON'T YOU KNOW? NO. Harper: NO? WHAT, ME? YES, OF COURSE. AFTER YOU SAVED HER. REALLY? YOU KNOW, THIS IS FASCINATING, BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? YOU HAVE TO ESCAPE! ALPHA KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU HAVE LITTLE TIME. HE WANTS YOU DESTROYED. THE TRANSPORT. THIS WAY. YOU GUYS GO. GO. PHEROMONES. YOU GOTTA TAKE ME TO LAURA. I THINK IT MAY BE TOO LATE. LAURA! LAURA, COME ON, GET UP! WE GOTTA GO. LAURA. OH--OH, MY GOD. SHE'S DEAD. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. YOU DID THIS. I DIDN'T. YOU ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN. I COULDN'T PREVENT IT. I WAS UNDER ORDERS. UNDER ORDERS? YOU KNOW HOW PATHETIC THAT SOUNDS? LOOK AT HER. LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ORDERS. YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE, AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM HERE! WHY? JUST WHY DID YOU DO THIS? WE WERE PREPARING HER FOR DISSECTION. YOU BITCH. SHE'S DEAD. LUCKY I WAS INTERRUPTED FOR A RECHARGE, OR YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND A LOT LESS OF HER WHEN YOU BARGED IN HERE. I'LL KILL YOU. UH-HUH. I DON'T THINK I'D COME ANY CLOSER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE, HARPER? HE WANTED TO SEE THE GIRL. WELL, NOW HE'S SEEN HER. KILL HIM. WAIT A SECOND. YOU'RE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE KILLED HIM. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DISSECTED LIKE THE OTHER ONE. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU? NOTHING. SO THAT'S IT? NO ACCOUNTABILITY. "MIGHT MAKES RIGHT" FOREVER. I'M SORRY. SHOULD HAVE RECHARGED. I'M NOT PICKY. I'M JUST AS HAPPY TO KILL YOU BY HAND. RAAH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? FIGHTING FOR A VALUELESS HUMAN? NO. WHAT THEN? MAYBE I'M JUST FIGHTING AGAINST YOU. WHATEVER. THIS IS YOUR LAST MISSION. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER? WHY DOESN'T SHE FALL DOWN? SHE'S VACATED. WHAT? SHE'S LEFT THE CONSTRUCT AND GONE BACK TO HER NATURAL BODY. IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD. SHE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. WHAT NOW? I'M SORRY. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. GET BACK. DON'T TALK, SHOOT! GIVE ME THE GUN. DON'T LET HIM GET INSIDE YOUR HEAD. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK THIS TIME, BUDDY. SORRY. WELL, HELL, LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS. YOU ARE GONNA DIE IN TERRIBLE PAIN. HA! THAT WAS FUN. SO TELL ME SOMETHING, WHERE ARE THESE FRIENDS OF YOURS NOW THAT YOU NEED THEM? RIGHT BEHIND YOU. HARPER?! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION. SO HE'S VACATED LIKE THE OTHER ONE? THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S GONE TO THE SAME PLACE? YES. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ESCAPE? WHAT ARE YOUR PEOPLE GONNA DO? Harper: THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK. Kevin: YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, FOLLOW ME. THROUGH THAT DOOR. AND YOU. HUH? STAND GUARD. WHAT, WITH THIS? THIS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. IF SOMEONE COMES, WIPE... JUST... AND... OK. DON'T POINT THAT AT ME. THESE ARE MY COMRADES. THAT'S ALPHA... CHARLEY. THIS IS BRAVO. AND THIS... IS ME. WHAT DO WE DO? DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. THIS ONE'S BRAVO? GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. IT'S ALPHA. HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE. HARPER. NO, YOU DON'T. NOW, HE'S TRYING TO LOCK ME OUT. SORRY, ALPHA, JUST NOT FAST ENOUGH. NOW WHAT? THAT'S ONE DOWN. WHO'S NEXT? THAT'S ALPHA, BUT HE'S NOT IN THERE. AND HE AIN'T COMING BACK. UNH! AAH. NOW ALPHA'S TRAPPED IN HIS OTHER BODY. RRR! AND HE KNOWS WHAT WE'VE DONE. GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT. NO, WE CAN'T DESTROY THIS ONE. WHY? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IN THE END? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, FLY THE SHIP BACK MYSELF AND TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED? NO, WAIT! THAT'S ALPHA IN THE CONTROL ROOM. HE SET THE SHIP TO EXPLODE. LET'S GO, LET'S GO. WAIT A MINUTE. WE GOTTA STOP THE FLEET. WHAT? YOU CAN'T. THERE'S NO TIME. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY'LL DESTROY THE EARTH. ALL RIGHT. GO. GET OUT OF HERE. NO, I'M NOT GOING. NO, I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE FLEET. GO TO THE TRANSPORT. WHAT ABOUT YOU? DO YOU REMEMBER THE SEQUENCE OF COLORS? YEAH, I THINK SO. RED, YELLOW, GREEN. GREEN, BLACK, GREEN. YELLOW, RED, GREEN, RED. GOT IT? RED, GREEN, RED. YEAH, RIGHT. GOT IT. BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GONNA-- Desmond: COME ON! Fred: LET'S GO! STOP IT, ALPHA. YOU CAN STOP THIS. WE DON'T HAVE TO DIE HERE. I'M ALREADY DEAD. WHAT USE IS THIS BODY TO ME? I CAN'T RETURN TO MY OWN FORM. YOUR NEW FRIENDS HAVE DESTROYED IT. WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO? DIE. ALPHA, STOP THE COUNTDOWN. WHY SHOULD I? BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A WASTE. FOR WHO? FOR ALL OF US. HMMPH. HOW COULD YOU BETRAY US? I TRIED TO GET YOU TO LISTEN. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO... LIVE AMONG THEM? IN THAT ARTIFICIAL BODY? IT WOULDN'T WORK. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR YOU HERE, EITHER. EARTH IS A TRAP. WE WERE AMBUSHED. THE HUMANS WANT TO LURE US HERE. THEY WANT TO LURE THE FLEET. WE FOUGHT THEM, AND WE LOST. YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY. NO, OUR SHIP... OUR SHIP IS FINISHED-- ONLY MOMENTS TO GO. GO AND SAVE YOURSELVES. YEAH, THIS IS IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? OH, GOD. I KILLED YOU ALREADY. YOU KILLED MY REAL BODY. I HAD TO JUMP BACK INTO THIS THING, AND I AM NOT HAPPY! IT'S 3 TO 1. THINK IT OVER. ODDS SEEM FINE TO ME. YOU WANT ANOTHER PIECE OF ME? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! DESMOND, COME ON. GET ON THE PAD. YOU OK? YEAH. WHAT'S THE MATTER? RED, YELLOW, GREEN... YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE SEQUENCE? I REMEMBER, UM... YOU CAN'T MAKE IT GO. LET ME THINK. THINK FAST, MAN. WE'RE IN TROUBLE. LAURA. GET ON THE PAD. WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? DO IT! HURRY! ARE YOU READY? HARPER? YES. ACTUALLY, IT'S BOTH OF US. HOW? I FIGURED IT WAS THE ONLY WAY OUT. THERE IT GOES. HOW DO YOU FEEL? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO? LET'S GO TO YOUR PLACE. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT? COME ON.
