English Subtitles by Keepvogel, based on German subs by KAF (Thanks!) Mielensäpahoittaja (2014) (aka The Grump) I am sad that times have changed. It used to be not as bad as it is today. At that time, the Russian neighbor wanted to expand, and we feared for our independence. After the war we feared that the fields would become collective farms. But then our President Urho Kekkonen had the idea to invite our neighbors to go skiing and drinking. "The Agreement for Cooperation and Mutual Assistance ..." Skis were made of wood and men of iron. You didn't need any tricks or doping to be successful. Women were made of rye, and the kitchen smelled of bread pastries. You could even get oven-fresh bread at the bank. Then you knew your money was in good hands. One smiled honestly and sufficient, but rarely. Hand built from long wooden boards. The air could circulate, there was no mold. But the old lady wanted electric radiators. That was supposedly modern and convenient. But most of all, it was expensive. And unnecessary. The first is always the best. The first house, car, the first wife... In the past you didn't have time to talk or discuss. We had to have children and rebuild the country. In old age you should have time for one another. I thought that that would last until the end with her. You don't have to start crying for such a thing. Something like this has never made me cry. We talked about it. Please listen to me. You shouldn't go to the field alone. - If only it had been the field! The basement floor is made of concrete. The ligaments are torn, the leg is like a wooden leg. We'll do a magnetic resonance tomography. Physiotherapy wouldn't be bad either. It is the youth who need therapy. In Tampere you would get an examination quickly. In Jyväskylä they would have space immediately. In Helsinki you would have to... You know where you end up when you go to foreign villages. In gambling dens and with young women on Mallorca. Isn't that a little too... Your leg is an acute case. We think about where you would be best kept. At home. I'm talking to the doctor. Your son is right. There are different phases in life. And the faster we... - I'm leaving. It is mealtime. - Everything will be fine. Assisted living Father? My brother fell in Karelia. I hit the floor in the basement. What's so dangerous about that? I don't go to Helsinki and let the youth massage me. Do you know what it was like for me to hear that you were lying in the basement? A few days longer and I'd be repairing the roof now. The water is already coming through the nail holes. So... She doesn't even know who you are. She is no longer here. We should look ahead. The sisters take care of them. You would be in good hands with us. Mother would be fine too. I'll stay here and take care of the house. The potato field has to be plowed. To be loosened. But you can't do that. I try it. The father has to take care of the son, not the other way around. That is how nature intended and wanted it. Why do you have to be constantly on the go? Forward? So to the daughter-in-law, to the big city. My aunt lived in Helsinki for 40 years, I guess. Why can't you stay in your own home? I'm not going to a skyscraper. You can hear the neighbors farting and are constantly monitored. Whenever I go, it's in my boots. and ax in hand. When I don't wake up at noon the newspaper will lie on my chest and the shirt will be buttoned. Why are the houses in the city illuminated from the outside? You have to empty the gutter or it will rust through. They send me to therapy. - Yes, Hessu called. The step was rotten. I have to fix it when I get home. The potatoes have to go to the cellar. We don't have a basement. - You need one. You have a great house. It's nice when the man brings the money home. I bring the money home; €108,000 last year. Oh. That's a lot of money for a woman. That does not make sense. I'm supposed to take a taxi just because my leg is blue. Where is the physiotherapy? And when? It's great that you came once. - I had to. It starts on Monday. And I'm definitely not going there earlier. I've now brought everything in. Goodbye Are the few things enough for the weekend? There was a negro at the gas station. He spoke Finnish. That's not a pretty word ... "Negro". - Oh yeah? Coffee time. Coffee time? Morning coffee, before noon coffee. Afternoon coffee, evening coffee. Coffee, coffee, coffee. We don't drink coffee. We don't even have a machine. I bought you one in 2005. At half price. Was a Christmas present. A briefcase for the son and for you ... ... a mocha master. Yes, that was a really great machine. How about tea I have mate here. Girls! They are with grandma. - Certainly not. Hey there are presents! - They are with my mother in Varkaus. Yes. I believe you. I've never been into anything like this. - In a bathtub? We have washed in the sauna since we cut our umbilical cord. What's that smell? - Lavender. It was used as a poison gas in the First World War. That... ... would be something. Because the children watch TV for so long, they are always tired in the morning. And then they hang around in the IT network all day. We bought it for Mirkku's final exam. So she can read documents ... - The radio is enough for that. We bought a radio in the sixties for the Tokyo Olympics. I still clearly remember Néwala's victory. Back then there were no children's rooms. Certainly no childhood either. Where is the radiator here? - The thermostat is by the door. I heard on TV the other day if you lower the room temperature by two degrees, you could save about five percent on heating. That's nice. But we have geothermal energy here. Is that enough, or should I get you another one? So make yourself at home. For the daughter-in-law. Oh! That wouldn't have been necessary. Oh no, the old lady no longer wears it. I bought it from Asuvaate in 1973. Washed them once a year. They never had to be patched. Nowadays they don't make anything durable anymore. The fabric breathes, it lets the sweat through. Thank you. It's really hard to find anything like that anymore. Perhaps the next generation will learn to drink coffee again. She did the crossword puzzles in pencil. I erased it. Wasn't that easy with the October 1985 issue. Oh yes? That's nice. Unbelievable. Half past eight. - It's not that late. Not late, but still half past eight. Do you know what's on the other channel? We should switch. How about if you switch? "Here is the news." Arvi Lind was a better news anchor. I like Rönkä better. - Nobody would believe him. The guy is a writer. - His crime novels are excellent. How can you write any good detective stories, when you sit in the TV studio every evening. And no good news either when you write down terrible things every day. I don't trust any made-up literature. The instruction manual for the Escort is a good book. It never gets boring. How much debt do you still have on the house? I don't know. Less than a hundred thousand. A hundred thousand euros? No sane person owes so much. The daughter-in-law jokes with me. The old woman and I never got into debt. No way. It is important to save. - That's the way it is. You've seen how it goes when you sign a loan while drunk. Monday is going to be an important at work. What about you? You deliver me an aged exchange student. Thank you so much! Our child is spoiled from watching TV. That's exactly what he says! And we sign drunk loan agreements. He said I would poison him. In the bathtub, with lavender. Why didn't you come here with him? A nursing service doesn't help me. Why didn't you take him to the hospital right away? And since when...? Aha. It suits the Lord well, of course, to be there and play video games. Do you have to plow the potato field? I am totally calm. You have to calm down. Breathe into a bag. Or in a potato sack. It makes me sad when you say things directly. Talking doesn't work in our family. I have seen this miracle twice. The first time it was Grandfather who spoke on his deathbed. He had kept it all his life and then suddenly roared it out. You have to cry. He even killed Taavi Mononen, and that was a righteous man. Taavi couldn't take it and tried to stab Grandfather although he was about to go to a better world. Taavi became a criminal. And everyone knows how that ends. The second time, it was me who talked too much. The old lady didn’t get that when it is cold, we just put on another pair of wool socks. Or go skiing. I miss the times where I kept silent about many things with the old lady. Incoming call Unknown number Hello. Here is the nursing staff ... Today? You want the leg today ...? No, no, it's fine. You don't need to come. Speak to you soon. Open up! I need to speak to Liisa. Peddling and begging are prohibited here. I do not understand. I need to speak to Liisa. Leave me alone with your religion. - I will if you ... I'm not in church and I don't want to be a hippie. Open the door. - What is it? Open up, I don't wanna scream. Don't yell around like that! What? What is it? - Open the door. You have to turn the handle. - What? It doesn't open. In which direction? As? - Turn the key. How come? - In the other direction. Good morning! I need to speak to Liisa. - Yes. The daughter in law? Wait here. Hey you crook! Lissu, come on, get up! Why don't you answer the phone The Kuskews are coming. He pushed his way in. Do you know what time it is? - Six o'clock, we have a lot to do. I work from home. The Kuskews are coming on Monday. Correct. Today is Monday. Today is some holiday. All Saints' Day ... There are no flights. Oh shit! - They'll be in Seutula in two hours. In two hours ... we'll take your car. I wish I could. I have to go to Vanajanlinna. Let yourself get pressed. Really nice of you. I'm sorry, but I have no choice. I need five hours. You can handle yourself. The nursing service will surely show up soon. Turn off the stove and do not touch any appliances. Contract, laptop ... What is this now? They need to be cleaned up. - For God's sake! Do you have a gutter brush? - We don't need them. You have to go now. I can find one. I have to check on the reservoir too. No, do not do that! Can't you even do nothing? The nursing staff will be here in a moment. No, they won't come. They do not come? - No So here you have... the car key. Sit in there and wait. You don't touch anything, and you don't move. Where do you put the key in here? In the Escort it was always here somewhere. And how ... - Stop it. Sit on the other side. It is better if I drive. Whether a woman can steer such a box in big city traffic... There will be sheet metal damage and reports in the local newspaper. Or a report about an old man who drives without a license? Would that look good in the paper? Move over! Is that the warning signal for when a woman drives? And you don't have to go to the bathroom? Have you been to the bathroom again? Please buckle up. Already happened. I didn't get my morning coffee again. People can do without food, but they have to drink. Can you wait until the airport? When the war was over, there was no coffee. There was coffee substitute for it. You drank it before you let yourself be beaten. I saw a documentary. It was said that coffee caused worse withdrawal symptoms than from drugs. But they're not available at supermarket prices. "Two packages for the price of one. "Not for resellers." - We're almost there. What do you want Latte Macchiato, Espresso? Choose one for your self. One? - A coffee. A normal coffee. - A coffee. A filter coffee. Filter Coffee. Do we have something like filter coffee? - no Unfortunately we don't. - Not? It does taste like a latte. - Take a latte. Does it taste like your mate coffee? We need service! Hey! If you can't wait, life is a terrible rush. Hello! What can I bring you? A coffee. Coffee? Coffee time is over. The next one isn't for another three hours. Do you want something else? At home I would eat fried potatoes with cranberries and drink a cup of buttermilk. - buttermilk? One fries and a large mug of milk. And another coffee just in case. He's always changing his mind. And the daughter-in-law? - I have no time. The worst deeds happen where you don't eat properly. Think about the war. - A feta salad to take away. They get really physical. I know what that is called today. "This is natural". Humanity has tried for thousands of years to get rid of the natural habits. Shitting in the great outdoors, blood feuds ... ... or that there. What about that? Sure you don't have to go to the bathroom? Well then... A pair of 200 euro pants! S-card holders welcome Hey! - Yes? The toilet door is closed. - Yes, it is locked. But I have to go to the bathroom. Now. - Do you have an S-Card? Yes, but they took my driver's license away. You don't need that. But you can get in there with an S-Card. Why with an Escort? That sure doesn't look good. They probably want more people to get an S-Card. But I only need one! And my son has it. That way it doesn't get lost. Do you want to borrow my S-Card? Borrow your Escort? - Yes. Why should I borrow your Escort? So that you can go to the bathroom. Goodbye An Escort from women. The world is getting smaller and smaller. How so? When a girl from Africa sells us French potatoes then where does it come from? From Herttoniemi. Jenni is on the same ice skating team as Mirkku. - Oh yes? No wonder she speaks Finnish so well. She is a skating neg ... I mean, a Herttoniemi girl. No problem. I welcome all new... ...Herttoniemis. They're always good sprinters. It is said that when the genes mix, the daughters become beautiful. They all become beauty queens. Is that so? - Clear. I also respect ugly women. It's not easy for them. An ugly woman's life is more like that of a man. She has to suffer and toil for her life. You can't just go to dance halls choose a useful husband. She doesn't get anything served ready or for free. It's not easy for the daughter-in-law either. Wait here. Do not go. When a policewoman comes, point your leg. I still stand on my own two feet. I am... - You don't say a word. I need five minutes. Can you wait five minutes and not move? It makes me sad when people rush. The youth always has to go somewhere very quickly. To get to the next rush in time. Can I wait five minutes? I once waited two days and two nights for a bus. But he didn't come. Because the line was closed in 1964. But when I sat and waited, it was back in 1972. I ran into the village and bought a Ford Escort. Bus lines are discontinued, Fixed telephone networks and postal delivery abolished, but the Escort never lets me down. I also waited a couple of decades for a new president. And I've been waiting since 1976 on Olympic gold in long-distance running. I'll wait for that until the end of my life. Huh? - Do you have a disability card? What? - Do you have a disability card? I don't have anything like that. - You must have one. But you have to be disabled for that. This is a disabled parking space. - But I didn't park it here. Who else? - The daughter in law. You're getting a ticket now. - But... I'll show you something. Why is it here in Soviet? So why do you build a floor slab for such a house? You need an ID. The weather was bad, so we were late. And before that, this traffic jam! I hope it doesn't go on like this here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, I had to take my father-in-law with me. I didn't have time to look for a carer for him. Sergei Kuskew. Good day. My name is Vadim Tarasenko. Ludmila Tolstaya. Pleasure to meet you. He has dementia. Did you say remenz? I have no remuneration. It is a matter of honor to take care of the elderly. We understand that. - Yes, it's a matter of honor for us too. It would be nice if you buckled up. Hopefully the three are not from the KGB. - There is no way they are. Do you know your real name? I need this deal so shut up. Maybe it could be fox. - More like deer. What are they talking about? About their own things. - Translate! Should I talk? - No. They talk about your cap. What animal the fur is from. I exchanged them with Holttinen for a couple of potatoes. On the market in 1951. That used to be a bear. The hat is made of bearskin. A nice hat. Very beautiful. It is very important to always protect your head. Otherwise you will lose your mind. You can see that in the youth. He talks about the youth. In the Kremlin, the great warlords always wore big hats. In the Kremlin they wear big hats. They looked at the nuclear weapons on Soviet Day. With crooked hats ... - Let it be! ... from their balcony. Soviet holiday was never my holiday. - Nice. Who came to Gorbachev? - We're not talking about politics now. Ah, Gorbachev, perestroika, glasnost, democracy. He likes history. Chernenko, Gorbachev. Finally shut up! I’ll say it for the last time. Shut your mouth! Don't move from the spot! There are a few things to say to the Soviets. I should indeed. No you should not! Shut your mouth! Do you still remember the big man on the tank? Listen, I'm serious! Brezhnev would not have made it... You can move this. Yes. Was it Chernenko? You forget the new names faster. - Take care. First there was Stalin... It was Stalin, Tymoshenko, Kalin... ... 42-inch LCD TV. You can order food to the house or visit the local inns. 1.6 million. Sorry? This is our offer. 1.6 million. Not negotiable. 3.2 million. We have a preliminary contract. The situation has changed. 1.6 million. Electric tools are a waste. Nobody wants to understand. Life is getting made easier and you don't know how to get a screw in anymore. When the electricity is gone, people will starve to death. The youth can no longer turn the microwave oven on. I'll buy a new device tomorrow. - Sorry. You don't have to translate this. She speaks Finnish. It is well known that the Soviets do not trust anyone. You are bringing a beautiful young woman with you. But she sees and hears everything. He knows I understand. - Where from? Those who can play cards well also know when the other is bluffing. He is a master at playing cards. - And what does that mean? How's it going? - What? How much did they offer? - 1.6. How much did you ask? - 3.2. It was always a fight with the Russians. - I have something else about the Soviet Union. First: I didn't like your Yeltsin. He didn't like Yeltsin. He was a drunk dancing around on the tanks. He danced drunk on the tank. Second: Siberia sounds interesting. It's cool there. Finns like that. He wants to go to a place where he can wear a fur hat. If someone says he's paying 3.2 million he has a reason for it. Thank you, father-in-law. I'll take over. Here holiday homes are built from quality wood. Here the houses are built from quality wood. They breathe. The framework does not rot and there is proof of everything. ... and everything is on the bill. In Leningrad the thermal insulation was ... Now you can get the plaster off the wall with a dish brush. We have to build properly to make it last. You build everything so that it lasts. There is no longer any need to secretly slip money to anyone. That's why you don't have to bribe anyone. Did you do the math? Have you ever thought about it? Sergey. Do you like woods? Everyone's right. A Finnish specialty. Finnish specials. Everyone can pick berries and mushrooms whereever they like. Everyone can pick berries and mushrooms wherever they want. Finnish youth have forgotten how to appreciate real work. Armchair academics are raised. My son just smiles when I buy him a new video game. Yes, yes, you know that. This leads to over speeding, crime, and you shoot at cops... You're right. The Pepsi generation. They drink Pepsi and they keep getting fatter. That Pepsi Generation. You drink and gain weight. My wife used to give my son Pepsi to drink. My wife totally pampered my son . Women always do that. You have to develop friendships if you want to do good business. Good luck, jump! Have a long life. Bear Weeks For good luck! - Have a drink with us! A schnapps. - I only drink two a year. And I've already drunk them. He's already drunk his two schnapps this year. Then let's drink on the next year. Then we'll drink on the next year. You never know if it will come. At least for Russian business people. Please do. - Everyone's... ... Right. - Everyone's right! Cheers! Cheers! Sergei, what are you doing? You are not allowed to smoke here. Stop it! I never thought that grandpa would make it catching a rabbit in the middle of town... Is the pig there? Nothing is better built than a pig. Except for the Ford Escort. He says there is no better pig than the Escort. You raise it yourself, get to know each other... ... and eat it for Christmas. It would be nice if you could speak a little more quietly. It wasn't our intention. One of the piglets became a good friend of mine. One of the piglets grunted so nicely. That's why the woman always stroked it. - The piglet? - Yes, like a cat. I have a picture of him here. We baptized Little Simon. It was called Simon. Sweet. I tried to hit it with an ax. On the head. - He tried to kill it. We're going to the bar. - I knew it. You have to be able to kill an animal that you want to eat. Thanks for your visit. Please don't come back. But you Finns are... ...complicated people, I would say. We stick to the rules. Therefore it is advantageous for you to do business with us. 2.4 million... ...Euro. 2.5. That is the threshold. It's a cheap price for it. May I? Believe what I am telling you now. There is no point in building them on a floor slab. A point foundation suits this terrain much better. The plates break when there is frost. ...they are not frost-proof. What good is a house when the ground bursts open beneath you? It will rot. - It's rotting. And what about the meltwater? - What about the meltwater? When there is high tide - When there is high tide... you can look for the house in the river. - ... you can look for the house in the river. One shouldn't mix alcohol with work. Everyone knows what will become of it. One shouldn't do business with the Soviets. Yrjänä has known that for a long time. They cheated him out of 400 marks while playing cards, during a crossing on the Georg Ots. That is a ship. They changed the rules. The Soviet man always does that. They always change the rules as it suits them. Crap! I already know what to do about it. Swearing does not help the daughter-in-law. I guess that's true. Hessu will pick you up now. He'll take you ... away. I will probably stay with you for a while. To help. - No no no. The best way to help us is to go to the hospital. I know hospitals too well. The people there make... ...a baby out of a person. And the food lacks salt. At home with you I would be of much greater use. I would help the girls with their schoolwork and... ... your son cleaning the gutters. - Listen! Daughter-in-law... - I have a name! I have two degrees and work for international companies. I don't make mistakes, at work or at home. I have three children, I am a good mom, not a daughter-in-law! I buy mushrooms and fish in the supermarket. I don't have to go to the forest for that. And you won't take me there again, for fuck's sake! Everything was okay until you came. Do you get what you screwed up? Without you I would toast to good business now. I would be a co-owner and have a career, instead of crawling around ass first in the woods or to travel back in time to Gorbachev! Your father is impossible, get him! - What happened? I don't care how. By combine or on foot. I know... He can be difficult. But father doesn't need anything other than a television and the news. Father! Father! I need your help right now! Have you thought about food? You always get so spirited if you haven't eaten. - We have eaten. And the hatted exchange student wants to stay with us. We talked about it. Talked about? - We have the fourth... Incredible! - But then his life would have a meaning. This is the craziest, dumbest, most nonsensical thing ever. Come here right now, or I'll throw your stuff in the trash. Okay... "Twisted Sister". Okay. I can still meet her at the hotel. You take a taxi and drive to us. If there is a problem, you call. Man seldom knows what is best for him. I've tried to find out what's best for me and the old lady. For 53 years, the old lady and I had a clear division of labor. I took care of the outside and the car the old lady took care of the inside and the children. My stomach was also part of the inside. But not the heating. When I was younger I couldn't imagine that one day the old lady is no longer next to me and the responsibility for upbringing lies with me. Things went wrong with the boys. One went to Belgium and the other one never finished at the master’s school. You always watch movies and imitate the tough guys. Do you think it makes you strong to you smoke like that? Okay, everything is done. Aha. Name? Stinde. - Tinde? Are you one of the hippie Swedes? My name is actually Timo. - Timo? Timo is a good name. Was cool with you. But now I need food. Timo. I have a suggestion. Food and wages for a little work. Yeah, something to pull in would be cool. They're from my field. Sergei and I found good porcini mushrooms. Did you grow the potatoes? - Clear. Cool. Long live self-sufficiency. Does Timo have a life partner? - I live in celibacy. Oh. And where are Timo's parents? They got divorced. I see my mother now and then. Parents should never part ways. When you find a good person there is little point to look for a better one. Because you won't find that. The news is already over. - Oh really? Yeah, it's getting late. There are messages in the IT equipment whenever you want, right? The UN climate conference in Poland started today. Rönkä. Don't trust it, Timo. Hey, hey, hey! No stop! That was close. People are allowed to get bumps. But not this Escort. The clutch is weird. Everything is strange. The Soviets are strange. That is very generalized. Did you play with her? - What? You have to play with the clutch to shift. Have you plowed the field? Well... - Didn't you make it? I didn't get to it because Lissu called me. And the ground was already frozen... - You do this as long as you can. There is no ground frost yet. I brought you potatoes. - Take them to the basement. We don't have one. - You have to have a cellar. Can I come down yet? - Yes. It's Tinte. Tinte is... What are you again, Tinte? - Marginalized. Tinte is marginalized. Does it smell like alcohol here? - Yes, we have toasted, with Sergej, Tarasenko and the most beautiful woman in the world. I told them about the piglets. You still remember Simon the piglet. Hi. The worker has earned his wages. Save half of it. Well. My father and I will continue tomorrow. All is well. Then we'll make you a bed now. Why isn't he in the hospital? We should take into account that something is uncommon here. There is a big difference in age. There is a complete post-war generation in between us. There was an interesting article... What kind of trash are you talking about? Which generation? From the 1960s... Hey, it's a wrecking generation. Look what he did today. Father's situation is difficult with his leg... You're about to find yourself in a difficult situation, my friend! You're pretty aggressive... - Shut up! Don't teach me You don't even know what is aggressive. Passive-aggressive might be... Why is a junkie lying in my bed with hepatitis? Your father is totally senile! I read this is surrogate father behavior... He smelled of alcohol. - I beg your pardon? You are now telling the Baboon King in the Hat that he is only visiting here. Can you do it? - I'll... - Can you do it? He was sleeping. He's sure to be wide awake now. Would that be so bad? Then cook him some evening porridge. So that he falls asleep again. SORRY OLD MAN OPPORTUNITY TOO GOOD, I HAD TO So... should I maybe now... ...make breakfast for you and Tintti? Timo is gone. And... maybe it's a bit boring for you here... I'll take you where there is more to do. I have enough to do. But I'll think about it. Until something better comes. And. Thinking is just as important. Where is she going now? Hm, don't know... maybe shopping. Or to work. One shouldn't drive when upset. The tree is probably a little too close to the house. That should be felled. I would not do that. Lissu is pretty pissed off. Just like Margaret Thatcher always was. I bought the thing at Christmas 2006. Every real man must have a chainsaw. Well, I didn't use the chainsaw very often. I was more likely to cut bread for the children. Give me a chisel so I can lift the chain. I'm not sure if Liisa likes the idea. The tree... Women are angry differently from men. They keep silent so angrily as if they were screaming loudly. Don't we want to wait for Liisa to come home? Then we can decide together. - Empty. Yes... I know. I have to play with it. Is there a Shell around here? - What? You save a lot of money if you look carefully. Shell! They violated human rights and destroyed the environment. Shell? - Yes. A gas station has violated human rights? Yes, yes... In the Niger Delta and... - Listen. It was Stalin who hurt people. Does the daughter-in-law use the car for shopping? Yes, I prefer to take the bike or the kickbike. - With what? The kick bike. - Kick what? It's like a scooter. My grown son goes shopping on a scooter? No diesel. Two-stroke. If you can't find it, ask. First a drop notch. So diagonally from top to bottom. On the direct route. How to do it. And what about those here? - Wrap yourself a turban with it. I saw a show about lumberjacks... What... - So with these belts... ...you control the direction of fall. - Oh yes? You went to school for 17 years and you don't know anything. Yes, I've had many years of school behind me. But we'd have to climb up and fasten the straps first. I know the life of a forest worker. So then... the big branches... You can't... Damn it! Don't yell like that, man! The leg is still there. The oak looks strange. The European flying squirrel nests there. They are fantasy figures. You have to get a permit from the city. That scared you. - You almost saw off my leg. I just touched it. Some people get frightened easily. - I'll get a professional. Aren't you man enough to cut a tree? I... I saw a documentary on National Geographic. You saw the native people of South America cut down trees. Please put on your safety glasses. With these straps you can control the direction of fall. When you're too stupid to see where it falls. Why do you always know everything better? It is the son who must obey his father. The youth put on helmets when they go to the fridge. Safety harnesses and pads, even in the cemetery. You are committing an environmental crime. I'm calling the police. Go ahead. You forgot to put a helmet on the greenhouse. Lucky that I have the safety glasses on. Who knows what else would have happened. It's just a mirror. That's just a dinosaur in our living room. What the hell is going on here? Are you stupid? What did you think you were doing? Everything was better before! But yesterday won't come back. Why don't you kick him out? xxxxI'm only gone a moment and my house is Afghanistan! I feed us! My job is at stake! Finally be a man! Do something! For today's people, yesterday is very different from what it was for me. What was yesterday for me is history for those guys here. I'M GONE. THE MAINTENANCE BOOKLET IS IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT. THINK OF THE CLUTCH. GREETINGS. ME MYSELF The world is not what I knew it to be. She's not what I thought she was. The days of the accordion are over. Now they have houses and electricity. I can't change the world or the people. I can't. A car bomb killed a dozen people in the Syrian city ​​of Hama today. The bomb exploded in the morning rush hour. It's easy to die of with your boots on. But I have gout. Do you know gout? It comes from the build up of uric acid. So from piss in the joints. The stuff is everywhere. Lots of sore bumps under the skin. I get injected with cortisone, day and night. But it doesn't help. I would like a schnapps. But I am not allowed to. That's where it started. Why don't they give us morphine? You could go away with that. There was such a cat. - Yes - Yes. She was pretty small. There is grandpa. Show him what you painted. Hello Grandpa! - Hey. Not so tight. How are you grandpa? Everything okay? - Yes everything fine. Look what I painted. - She painted all day. Is the daughter-in-law working? Mia and Melissa, sit down there. There's a chessboard there and playing cards and colored chalk. You can paint great things there. I paint the tiger there. He looks so nice. So... Lissu... she had to go back to work. She is in the hotel. She left us a few days ago. Why then? You could say that, but... You didn't stop her? It's not that easy. It is easy. Nothing in the world is as simple as that. You don't just let your old lady go. Happy times, Helminen. I hope you can cope with the gout. You can't chop kindling with your eyes closed . First you peg the wood, and then you chop it. Very well! This is men's work. There is no male or female work. - How does this weird system work? As durable as Yugoslavia? I do not drink coffee. This time you drink it. I do not eat meat. This is not meat, this is alder smoked ham. What are you aiming at? Now listen, son: if a woman tells you something don't believe her. You have to know what she wants. We men build houses and she wants to talk about it. When the old lady tells you she doesn't want Christmas presents, what do you do then? I don't buy her any. - No You buy her a gift so expensive that it will hurt you for another year. When the old lady says she wants to talk to you more what do you do then, son? - I'll talk. Nonsense! You take her to the bedroom. How so? Even you can't be that stupid. Is that how you did that to mother? The firewood won't finish if you just chat. We don't need a stove. - Does she have any doubts about geothermal energy? Geothermal energy is not the problem. Then what's the problem if it wasn't the cold? Hello, Sergei. Liisa. Yes. Yes. I was still thinking... They are clean! I know. Timo cleaned them up. You should only practice for when they are full. We hire a company for this. A company for cleaning. And what does the landlord do? He's on the couch. No wonder the old lady is gone. She hasn't gone because I haven't cleaned here! They are clean! I stop now! A good driver creates safety. You have to pay attention to safe driving. The old lady likes that. Open the door for her and wash her back. Do everything you haven't done before. Build a stove. - We don't need an oven. The brick ones are best. We'll get the stones first. We don't need stones! If you always drove safely, then what was mother's problem? What are you talking about? - You lied to us. But the stamps on the postcards gave it away. What was wrong between you? What was wrong with you guys? It got cold. Cold? How long was she gone? About half a year. Came back by itself. I didn't plead with her. The frost drives the pigs home. Half a year? - Yeah, about the hang of it. It was exactly 168 nights. Just because she was cold? - Hence all disputes originate. Whether it is 17 or 23 degrees. You know that when you have experience. Is that the reason for a dispute? It could also be that she was offended. I told her ... ... that she always spoils you. - What does "you" mean? You and your brother. She gave you lumps of sugar. Let your hair grow long. She didn't wake you up for morning milking. I preferred to do it myself. Pekka has always been fine. I am fine. And the family is fine even if you don't want to see it. But you would have let the gutter rot. And when you walk on the lawn, you put on a helmet. Pekka went to Belgium. Tell me why someone is going to Belgium. Because he has a job as a nuclear physicist! And one of the best is! These jobs don't exist here! He is even written about in the newspaper! Not in ours. Not in the Suomen Kuvalehti. That's because it's not a magazine for nuclear physics! Pekka couldn't even do an oil change! Damn idiot! There's no toilet in the hardware store. If you need to go to the bathroom, now is a good time. Your clutch is wrong. Calm down! The food is almost ready! Come down, girls! Food is ready! Look what I found papa. Hello Grandpa! - Hello. Hello Grandpa! Thank you. Wasn't it good? Soya bolognese... So... Soy? - Soy. Well, if there wasn't anything better. Why is grandpa's car on the tree? Because it's an old car. Do all old cars drive into trees? - Yes. For the old there is nothing like a tree. We're going to bake now, grandpa. Are you coming with me? Yeah... I'll be right there. Yes, you do very well. You first form a ball, and then you make a small hole... It looks like grandma's handwriting. - These are old recipes from her. She left them to me. Grandpa was busy outside and we baked inside. You can fight about it later, who will get which recipe. Hello. - Hello. I behaved terribly. I'm so sorry. Let's forget - Are you baking? Yes, the girls and I... - That's so beautiful... And... Greetings from Sergej. Yes, well, thank you... And what are you doing right now? That’s a bakery! I made the others sad. I hurt them. A raisin bun. The beginning of many beautiful things in life. You drink coffee with the girl next door and just look at each other. You don't dare to talk. Then there are sweet rolls. The sugar falls on the plate. It's kind of fun. The sugar gets into the blood. In that moment you feel very comfortable. You dare to look her in the eye. You is smiled at. And you have to smile a little yourself. Even inside. The wedding follows a year later. And after nine months the baptism. When the baby can stand, you lay the foundation for your own house. You build your own house. You only leave it with the ax in your hand with which you have felled the trees for the house. Then you watch the woman baking. How her hands move and her hips swing along too. You pretend you're so hungry that you can't leave the kitchen. But the woman knows that you are looking at her. Later, while eating the dough, you tell the woman that she's still the same girl you fell in love with. Even if her butt has got a bit wider. And even without words you say that it wouldn't hurt if it even got a little wider. I stay with you. I wish you were with me again. My life has now become like that of a boy. Who makes too much racket. Who is always in some sort of trouble. "And now for the news. "Mining, politics in the neighboring country... "Those are the topics tonight." That Rönkä is not so bad after all.
