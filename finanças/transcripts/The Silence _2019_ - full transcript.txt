Surface team, do you copy? Copy. We're at the system's furthest extreme, just blasted through the rockfall into the second chamber, about to... Listen. Cave team, what's... Oh, my God! We've got to get out of here! We got to get out! Ally. Dad always told me I was gifted, the way I was able to adapt so quickly to becoming deaf, feeling those around me. My name is Ally. Look at me everyone, I can read lips. Maybe not all those around me. So, we're going to have to re-route the main drain, which means we're going to have to put in a whole new pumping station. And that's not going to be cheap. Okay, so fix it. Oh, why don't you cut the shit, Max? What was that? You heard me. Wait. Max, you recommended the engineer who caused this problem, so... And you guaranteed me a specific cost for the work upon your initial ground inspection of the site. Okay, we'll fix it. Good. That guy's a prick. Yeah, well, I can't afford to lose any clients right now. With all the jobs we've been doing? Well, you know, college does not come cheap and you'll find that out when you settle down and have children of your own. Why do I have to? I live vicariously through you. Ally pick a school yet? Uh... no, but I'm hoping it will be NYU. Good school. Yeah, it's a great school. Real close to home. Yes. Yes. Look, I don't want her going halfway across the country. She's not ready for that .-Oh, she's not ready? No. Excuse me. Hello? Hey, you busy? I'm just leaving work. Could you please stop and pick up-mom's prescriptions on the way home? Yeah, sure. No problem. And, Hugh, a parent from Ally's school called, she saw two boys mocking her and joking around behind her back. Again? Yeah, again. But please don't say anything to her, you know how she is, just don't say anything. Okay. Bye. Bye. I need a drink, you look like you could use a drink, let's get some drinks. Why, when I can live vicariously through you? All right. Hey. Hi. I told you not to buy him all those damn electronics. He's 12, mom. All the kids have them. Yeah, I know, but he shouldn't. Jude, no games before homework. But this primes my brain. Hi, Rob. How did you know that was me? Your hands smell like Twinkies. I washed them. Okay. I did. Can I walk with you for a while? Sure. My parents are taking me to look at cars this weekend. Really? Yeah. If it was up to my parents, I'd never drive a car for the rest of my life. That's no big deal, I'll just pick you up every day. Deal. Deal. Ally's home! Hi, buddy. How's my boy? Hey, dweeb. Butt face. Hi, mom. Where have you been? Why are you so late? I walked. You walked by yourself? No, I walked with Rob. That's the second time this week. That's because she wants to bone him! Jude! Who cares? You should have texted me, Ally. How do I know where you are? We're just friends, mom. Right. Have you kissed him? Mom! I think she kissed him. She better not have. Everyone has their own story, where they were when it happened.. ...what they were doing. This is how it happened for us, this is our story. Grandma! Ooh... This is awkward. You know, these aren't mine. You know your mother, she will ground me indefinitely. I won't tell. Thank you, sweetheart. I love you. Go on, off to bed. Then again I'm not telling... I know. Three years ago, I lost my grandparents and my hearing. But somehow, I feel like it's my parents who lost the most. I know, but as her mom we cannot... Hey, do you sleep with that thing? Hey, dad. Hi. So, who is he? Oh, my God, Dad! I'm your father, I'm supposed to know these things. Come on. Mom freaked out on me. Really? Is that what happened? You guys are afraid to let me leave the house. It's stupid. We worry about you. Well, you shouldn't, because I'm perfectly fine. Okay. So is he a nice guy or... Yes. Yeah? He's really nice. He's even learning to sign. I like him already. Dad, what? What? No. So, how is everything, okay? How was school today? It was okay. Good. You know you can talk to me about anything? I know. Okay, don't stay up too late. Love ya. You need to wake up. Something's happening! What's going on? Unprecedented proportions... What's happening? Is it terrorists? Uncle Glenn! They don't know. ...limiting all media from entering the affected areas. But New York One can now confirm that the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have both been hit, the number of smaller town attacks continuing to climb. First they say it's terrorists and they say it's chemicals. Maryland and West Virginia. Built up locations, areas... Try another channel. ...seem to be... ...who insist the infestation is under control. Images on social media are telling a much different story. We'd like to warn our audience the images you are about to see are graphic. Dad? It's okay. It's fine. Another video posted just moments ago was shot inside one of the affected areas and has since gone viral. What the hell does that mean? "Don't make noise." ...urging people to stay in their homes... Stay here. REPORTER: ...and to stay silent. National Guard Units have been deployed to all affected... Shit, man. Everybody, let's do what they say. Put your phones on silent, okay? What's happening? I don't know. ...scientists exploring the cave, blasted through an ancient rockfall sealed off for millions of years. What the? Jesus Christ. And close all windows and doors. Do not make noise. Do not attempt to... All right, you hang tight, I'll be right back. Where are you going? I'm gonna get some gear. You want to stick around while a million of those things show up? No, but we're supposed to just stay here and stay silent. Right. Then the cities are the worst place to be, aren't they? Do not make noise. Do not attempt to drive. Mom, if you're not up to this, then we can stay. There are plenty of people waiting this out in their homes. No. You do me a favor, put these with your things. Hide them as best you can. I don't want the kids to see. Okay. They're all that matters now. Hey, you got room for this? Yeah. What's that? Tactical supplies. Whoa! Can I go with Uncle Glenn? Um... I'll take care of him. Okay. Stay away from those. I'll follow you. Okay, let's go. What are you doing? Give me the baby. Come on. Please, don't! Oh, my God. Someone help me, please. I'll go with her. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hi. Oh, no. Oh, my God. A state of emergency has been called for the entire eastern seaboard, with death tolls in all infested areas being described as catastrophic. The CDC is urging everyone west of interstate 77 from Cleveland, south of... Are we doing the right thing? ...to remain west of that line. Do not approach... I don't know. But where up north are you gonna go? I don't know. Some place quiet. You should leave too, you could follow us. My parents said we're staying. The news says better to stay put. So much for car shopping, huh? Don't cry. I'm sure this is all going to be over soon. Um... let's make a promise that we're going to stay in touch with each other. Yeah. Yeah. Promise? Promise. Everybody just wait here, okay? But Otis has to pee. Al right, make it quick, okay? Come on, Otis. Hey. Hey, I got this, you just watch him. All right, okay. Hey, how you doing, buddy? I don't know. Scared, I guess. It's okay. You're riding with Uncle Glenn, so... He's a tough guy in times like this. Do you know how I met him? No. We went to high school together, and after school these three guys, these lacrosse players, they... sort of all came up to me and they were going to bully me. And, um, I... I wasn't going to fight them, so I tried to talk my way out of it. Before I knew it, he shows up... grabs one of the guys and head-butts him. And the guy drops right to the ground. And the other two guys just kind of ran away. And we've been best friends ever since. I wish I was that brave. I have a feeling you might be. All right? So, don't worry. Shut up! Shut the dog up! She's deaf. She can't hear you! Okay, okay, don't shoot! What do you want? Just shut up! Okay, all right! Okay! Tell me what you want. Shut up! All right. What do you want? Keys to your car. Okay. Look, I'm not messing around! Okay, okay. Don't shoot, please. Please. Ugh! Oh, oh... Everybody in the car. Please, man. Please, man. Please! Don't leave me here, man. Please! Those things are gonna catch up to me. Please, don't leave me! Please! What's he doing? HUGH: I don't know. What's going on? He... What? Hey, hey, hey! You okay? He's good. He just wanted to be with you. Hey! It's okay, it's all right. We got to go Roads are going to get bad. All right, all right. Okay, all right. Thanks. What are they saying? They're calling them vesps because of how they swarm. Avispa means wasp in Spanish. How could we not know about them until now? Well they got trapped in that cave, whatever they were, and then they became something else. They're not supposed to be here. Dad! Watch out! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay? Yeah. What do you think? Man, it's all jammed. I know. Okay. Okay. You follow me. All right. Okay. This is the emergency broadcast system, if you are hearing this transmission, the vesps are continuing to spread outward from the cities and north along the Hudson River. Infested States now include Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. If you are residing in any of these States, do not attempt to flee. Whoa! Whoa! Hey, what's up? Listen, it's going to get a little rough up ahead. If anything looks too shoddy, I'll stop and clear a path, okay? Okay. Just lead the way. You got it, buddy. What's the matter? Afraid that minivan of yours couldn't keep... Oh, shit! Hold on! Glenn? Glenn! Hey! Hey! Glenn, hey. Hey. Hey. Can you get out? Hey, man, my... my leg's stuck in here. Okay. Call an ambulance, okay? I'm going to pass out. Okay, all right. We're going to get you out of there, all right? Just... I'm going to get you out. All right. We'll get you out. The kids okay? Yep. The kids are fine. Don't worry. Okay. Sorry, it's all right. It's jammed, sorry. I'll get you out, okay? You got to leave me. You... You got to go. You got to get out of here. Nope. No, no, no. We're going to wait with you, I'm not leaving you here. What you gonna wait for, man? Those things to show up? I'm not leaving you, okay? The only way I'm getting out of here is with cutters. My guess is the fire department is kind of busy right now. Okay, all right. Let me just find something to pry you out. Okay? Just one second. No luck? No, nothing. Oh, man. Hang in. Okay, just stay there. We'll get you out of here. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Hey, man. Hugh? Fuck! Yeah? Yeah, what? Go get my guns. What? I need my guns. Why? Get my guns. Please, hurry. Okay. Okay. All right. There you go, what do you... You want the... Here. Here. Yeah. Okay? All right. Okay. Now, listen to me.. Yeah. I'm going to try again to get you out of here, all right? What are you doing? Why do you want those? I'll shoot you if you don't go, that's what I'm gonna do. You got to go take care of your family. All right, I'm going to go, we're going to go find somebody with some cutters, okay? We're going to get you out of here and to a hospital, all right? Okay. Okay. We're going to be back very soon, okay? God damn, Hugh. It's okay. I promise. I promise. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on, let's go. No luck? Okay. Is he dead? No. No. He's not dead. He's just hurt very badly. Let's go. We're gonna get back to the highway and find somebody with cutters. Get in the car. Come on. No noise. Turn it off! What? Keep him quiet! Shut up! Glenn. Let's go! Let's do this, you son of a bitch! Shut up! Those things stink like shit. I know, honey. Don't swear. They were scratching in the same places over and over. We can't stay here. Okay. I need to try something, okay? Stay here. Quiet. It's okay. Find her inhaler! Sh, sh, sh... I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Listen. They can't see. Only hear. Dad. I know how to live in silence. We all do. Nothing above a whisper. No phones, no texts. We're going to need shelter before it gets dark. Okay? That's our only option. Okay? I need your lighter. She doesn't smoke. I'm sorry. Okay. You guys pack your bags. Why? It's okay. Oh, God. Come on., come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Everyone needs to rest. Z Yes, okay. Everyone rest. Got room for one more? I know you may hate me for a long time. I know... but... I had to. I'm sorry. You need to tell the kids. I suspect Ally knows something, but it's not right to keep it from Jude. It's not. Their dog just died and now I'm supposed to tell them their grandmother's next? I just about got us killed back there. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. There's a house! Okay. Let's go. Okay? Get the hell off my land. This is private property, god damn it! I said get the hell off my land! Let's go that way. It's about thirty feet. You guys up for this? I'll go first. Once I'm through to the other end, I'll wave you through. Okay? Okay. You come. Okay, Jude, you first. A rattlesnake! Oh, no! Get her on the couch. See if you can find any peroxide or alcohol. I'll get some scissors. Does it hurt, mom? Just a little, honey. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left... I found it. Oh, shit. Rob? Rob, what's happening? How are you? Did you get somewhere quiet? I think so. Rob, where are your parents? They're dead. Rob, get out of there. Rob, you can come here, I'll explain how to find me. Rob, get out of there. Rob! Please. Hey, kiddo. What have we found out today? Nothing good. A man was crucified in Mississippi. Okay. It's okay. Without antibiotics that infection's going to spread. Okay. So, we have to find some. Are there any here? There's none, I've looked everywhere. Nothing? Nothing. Okay, so how long? It depends on the person. Okay, but you're a nurse. How long? Without antibiotics, not long. Okay. Why can't I go? No, you have to stay here and take care of mom with grandma. I'm sorry. I wish Glenn was here. Me, too. There you go. Okay. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. Okay. Vesps? Oh, okay. Come on. We have to go around back. Stay right behind me. Oh! Ugh! We need fire. The mop. Stay alert. He's weird. No, it's okay. Let's go. You did good, mom. Yeah, not too shabby for a field dressing, huh? That's not what I meant. I know. They're back. Stay here. Jesus, Ally. CNN's on most of the time, but it drops out now and then. Yeah, I know. I can't get anything. They're broadcasting from a bunker somewhere. I don't know. Who, CNN? They said that vesps don't like intense cold. People above the Arctic Circle, they're surviving. There's footage of dead vesps in snow drifts. You've seen that? Yeah, but there's something else. What? They're calling it The Grey. It's places where the electricity's gone out and people are getting cut off when their phone and computer batteries die. Like entire regions of the country are being wiped off the map. Jesus. It's like we're back in the Dark Ages. I made this for you. I think Uncle Glenn would have wanted you to have it. Thank you, dad. Just be... be careful with it, okay? Just... He's here. What do they want? I don't know. I'm going to go talk to him. Aren't you going to take the gun? No. No, thank you. [exhales deeply We have to head north. Okay. Okay? I love you. I love you. Hugh? Get up. I don't see anybody. Dad! What is it? It's a little girl. Let me look. Jesus. All right, let her in. I think she's in shock. Are you alone? Are you okay? Why are you here? What's your name? It's okay. Hugh, look at her jaw. It's okay. Oh, God. Did they send you here? Ugh! Okay! Phones were ringing. Phones are silent now. Get in the basement. No! [screeching You stay here... my darling girl. Dad! [Thunder] We know the vesps don't like the cold, but will they evolve and adapt like they did in the past? I know I did. So, will the rest of humanity evolve? Will we adapt to this new world of silence and remember what it is that separates us from them? Maybe. I guess it's just a question of which of the two species does it first.
