Luciano Serra pilot Any reference to facts or persons is purely casual. Flights on the lake authorized by the higher authorities. Maximum safety. 50 lire. That's 8, papa! Back to back! Watch out for machinegun fire. Fire! Fire! Press the button! Not like that with your foot. But it's hit! It's falling! Look! It's on fire, papa. That's nine! Where's the boss, Marietta? -Outside on the plane, I think. Put on the parachute and jump down. - No, it's very good here. Come on, jump down! Ah, I'll put you down now. I'll give you a good bath, eh? See? Here. Luciano? Luciano! What? -There's a letter for you. Here, read it now. OK, throw it down. Pietro, go get it. -Right away, Captain. Aldo, what're you doing? You're getting dirty! He's always dirty with oil, this boy. - No, he's clean as can be! Imagine, he shot down 8 enemy planes in 5 minutes. 9! 9, papa! -Yes, 9, 9... Yeah, yeah, great, both of you! Luciano, please, read the letter and come now, I have to speak to you. - OK! Thanks. ...regarding the house and hangar. I'm obliged to tell you if, this week, you don't pay the 6-months missed rent, I'll have to evict you immediately. Papa? -Eh? We're not taking mama with us, right? -Where? "Where"? Our trip around the world, remember? -Ah, yes! Mama doesn't like flying. OK, if mama doesn't like flying, we'll leave her home and go round the world by ourselves, right? Where are we going? -We're going, going...to Paris, London, America, India... Always with this plane? No! We'll buy the most beautiful plane in the world. It'll have wings all gold, and a silver body. And we'll go, we'll go... Now I go to mama who's waiting for me. You, though, must come do your homework. I already studied, papa. -Come, you need to do it again. Ah, look! My little wife at work! So what is it? Tell me, Luciano, you think we can go on this way? Why? Is something worng? -You ask me? What are you waiting for? For them to throw us out of the house? If they throw us out... we'll sleep outside. Outside it's warm, we'll be fine. -You! You'll sleep outside. But me and the child, no. It's two years we've lived this life, you know. Without counting the constant worry your flights on your broken-down plane give me. No, no, no, don't insult the plane. It doesn't deserve it, poor thing. Besides, my life, you married an aviator, not a clerk. So, no more worrying. We survived the war, and now you want me to worry... Listen, Luciano, I speak to you heart in hand. Not through egotism, you know. You know I've always love you, right? Haven't I demonstrated loyalty against everyone? Against my relative? Against anyone who tried to put you down? Signora, can I take the blouses? -Yes, yes, take them. That's true, I recognize it. You're a fine wife and a good mother. But I as well, after all, don't think... -No, no. You think you're a good husband and a good father. But, look, Sandra, come here! Sit near me. What do you want? Me to go to your father, hat in hand... Why not? If now he's ready to open his arms to you! I didn't marry you to get embraced by your father. So I'll be the one who goes to him, okay? If I say this it's because... Because you don't love me anymore, right! Because you've gone to the other side, even you. No, no. It's not that. But maybe, in your condition, there's not time anymore for love. O Luciano! If you go on like this, I'll be forced to leave. I was born and lived among people who work. I understand, you mean I'm a goof-off. Is that what you mean? You're a dreamer. O, come on! I hate to tell you so, Luciano. But this is the reality. You're afraid of the truth. Not I. I'm not afraid! Sandra! See, Captain? Does it shine enough? If no, I'll give it more shine. No, no, it shines, it shines. It's not varnish that's lacking. I don't understand why the Sesto people haven't replied about the new hull. Especially since your friend Morelli is there. Yes, I'm going to Sesto today. But even Morelli, what do you want him to do? He's an employee, a test pilot. Aeronautic Shipyard, Dept. of revisions and tests. Beautiful, eh? Remember our old crashes? -Yet they flew. Whereas now... Eh, I really didn't need this response. It means I'm grounded. At least I could have a job like yours, here. We did the war togather, Morelli, and you know what I can do. And you think I've not thought of that too? -Yes, thank you. But a job here for me, see, would mean so much! For me and for others. -But it's a miracle we're afloat here! Things happen, dear friend! I'm afraid from one day to the next that they'll get rid of us too. When there's war, there're never enough planes or pilots. But now... We live in a world, dear Luciano! So what we've done counts for nothing! -No, nothing, nothing. Let it be said of me that I see things personally. -Ready, signor Morelli? Yes, ready, I come now. Don't go away, I'll make a short flight and be right back. Go, I'll wait for you. Pietro! I'm coming, Captain. What happened? -It happened they turned off the electricity. Turned off the electricity? And you didn't throw them out? -But they didn't hear the signora either. Then she left suddenly, with the child, and hasn't come back yet. And where is she? -At Commendator Nardini's. Already... Alright. Lead the way and get me another candle. Good evening, Captain. -Good evening, Marietta. But at least there's something to eat? -There is, there is, it's all ready. Good, bring it, 'cause I'm hungry. Hello, who's speaking? Ah, she's not coming back here. Okay, I understand. They're sleeping there. Yes, yes... Thanks. Good night. She's putting him to bed. You made a call? Yes, Commendatore. I spoke to him personally. Goodnight, treasure. Okay, you'll tell me. Eh, you don't say good night to grandfather? I have the vague impression of not being too sympathetic to the signor. Rather, what were you saying, you, before dinner? Ah, yes! Six months without paying the rent? I believe it! A flight on the lake costs 50 lire, and with one flight per month, there's little to live on. Yet I like to see them, these enthusiasts of flying. But who were they? -Men who lived at the hotel in Stresa. They'll be back tomorrow, though. And what did they want? -Well, they wanted to fly. Ah, yes? Just today when I was out? What luck! Thanks, Marietta. It's sad, Pietro, eating alone! What do you say? Well...for one evening... Just one night? -Yes. You think so? Good. Know what I do now? I go to Stresa, to the Grand Hotel. At least there there's electric light. -Bravo! Ask Marietta to get out my old smoking jacket. -Right away! Good evening, signora. Big business, Captain. All the rooms are occupied till the end of the month! And what clientelle! -Big businessmen! O we can please them! We've modernized everything Also the bar. We needed to, all new. -Bravo, my compliments. Giorgio, three Cinzanos! -Romeo, three Cinzanos for the baron. By the way, did you see this morning those two Americans who wanted to fly? No. -Signor Thompson. He's head of a big American airline. And his wife. Ah yes, they came when I was out. -He's a drunk! She's a flower! Cognac, Giorgio. -Right away! I'm the one who sent them this morning to your hangar. Thanks, Giorgio, thanks. Romeo-Papa, a cognac for the signorina. I meant to tell you, our account is suspended. From when you came here with your wife, remember? Ah yes, I wanted to... Don't worry! When you have it. Good evening. -Orange with lots of soda. Right away, signora Thompson. You, Count? O for me, for me... I'll tell you later. Ciao, Nicoletti! Oh, my dear! how are you? A bachelor tonight, eh? Look, the old guard! Always alert! You're so elegant! You got married? -Yes, yes. Well... And you? How's your aunt? -Trying to make me a serene life. Fine woman! You're in the hotel here? Yes, for a month. I can't manage to get away. You know how it is: some look for me here, some look for me there... Here's your whiskey, signor Thompson. What for you? -A coffee. -An espresso. -With lots of sugar. Some tea. -Tea ready. They're the Thompsons. They were looking for you this morning. Yes, I know. ! He's a big shot in American aviation. I'll introduce you? That's what I'm here for. -Great. May I? Captain Luciano Serra, pilot. Pleased, Captain. -My pleasure. He runs that magnificent hydroplane... -Yes, we admired it! Dorothy? Captain Serra. My wife. The Captain's the person we looked for this morning. Ah, it's you who made me wait so much! Sorry to have made you make a useless trip. I'd have liked this morning to make a tour of the lake. Must be beatiful, seen from on high. Just means postponed a day. Sorry not to have a vehicle worthy of you. But think, signora, if airplanes could be decorated! Mine has invalid's medals. I think its owner's are enough. Tell me how you got them. No, what an idea! So tell me while dancing. -No, that's worse! Dancing I'll stumble. Uh, you're so difficult! Let's dance. Great, you betray me? Watch out: he's a fighter pilot. O, never fear! Good morning, Commendatore! -Good morning. Please come in. Thanks. They took away our light but haven't taken the chairs yet. Please. -Thanks. To what do I owe the honor of your visit? It's about my daughter Enough! Enough, for my account and for Sandra's account. Too bad! Yes. Because just today I was finally able to tell her that my manias and our sacrifices have finally reached practical conclusions. Yes, I know these stories. Look, Serra, listen to me calmly. You're proposing yet again to abandon your fantasies to come down to earth... to "land"... as you say. I repeat for the hundreth time: There's a place for you in my plant which would guarantee serenity to you, my daughter, and the child. I thank you, Commendatore, but can't accept. Now less than ever. I'm convinced the world isn't limited to the ground between your mill and my hangar. There's lots of room. The sea, the ocean... America, I know. Don't make me laugh. -Laugh all you want. The contract is serious and I'm eager to accept it. Yes, I know your business, dear Serra. But Sandra will remain in my house. As long as I'm not convinced it's worth the trouble. Yes, I can't consent for my daughter to run yet another new adventure. It's enough she's put up with till today, thanks to you! Understand? Yes, I understand. But it's she who won't understand. My wife won't look at the situation. But are you sure Sandra shares your opinion? Very, because Sandra has her head on her shoulders, not in the clouds. She doesn't fly. Think of the child. I'll not believe... -Enough! Please, signor Nardini. Sandra will do what she thinks most appropriate. Too much tenderness binds me to her that I could doubt her good intentions. But I'm leaving for her, for my son! In any case, be assured I'll not come back unless... Unless covered in glory, I know. -That's not what I meant. But I take your irony as a good sign. The Americans. Those men who want to fly. -Okay, I'm coming. Anything else, signor Nardini? No, we've even talked too much, dear Serra. It's only left me to wish you bon voyage and good luck in the land of dollars. Remember though to extend me this courtesy: Don't turn to me the day you need a ticket back. Ah, don't worry! See you. -See you. Aldo! Papa! My handsome papa! My paparino! Why didn't you come sooner? -I couldn't. Have you seen mama yet? -No, not yet. Today I'm here for you, just for you. Let's find somewhere where no one sees us. There, papa. We have to watch out, papa, because if grandfather sees us on the lawn, he'll yell. Ah, terrible, grandfather! Imagine, yesterday I left him speechless, because I said: "Wow, that beard!" Why'd you say "Wow that beard"? Yes, you can't laugh, you can't talk loud, you can't eat fruit with your hands! So, at table you eat fruit with knife and fork, then go to the garden and eat it with your hands. But you must respect grandfather, because he's good and loves you. Now, Aldina, let's speak of serious things. I came here to squeeze you tight and tell you, if I have to go away... -But papa, what're you saying? No, just for a little time! -No, not even for a little. I'm coming too! Come on, you're a little man and must not cry. You have to realise that your papa has to make lots of money, for you and mama, if not how'll we manage? Some things you can't understand, but you must realise your paparino doesn't live just for you. -No, I don't want to! You stay here and wait for him. -No, no! An aviator who cries! Okay, okay, Aldino, I shan't leave. Happy? -Do you mean it? You promise? Yes, I promise you. Aldo? Go to mama. And don't tell anyone you saw me! Ciao! You think that's how to put things away? Yes, I'm cleaning up poverty. It can't believe I'm putting together these rags and going away, finally! Say... you're really determined? -Very. I've waited till today. Sandra... hasn't returned. Come on, don't get tragic now. Pietro, hurry up! -It's done, signor Luciano. But Franco, these last days I've learned many things. Now I'd leave even if I didn't have Thompson's contract. Because I can't take it anymore. Don't exaggerate! No, I'm not. Look Franco, I accepted enthusiastically the Thompson business, because it allowed me to resolve my situation and my family's without resorting to my father-in-law. You who know me can imagine if my ideal is to be an employee, even as aviator, dependent on someone commanding me. It was an arrangement I arranged myself, in my field, and it was easy. Did you see what resulted? For me this isn't a departure, now. It's a flight! More than an opportunity, it's a way, a pretext to get away. Shall I take away this case? -Yes, yes, take it away. Over there, then... Well? Over there you'll find good reasons to come back in 5 or 6 months. You think? Franco... I'm glad you're here because I wanted to talk you about my child. While I'm away, go to my wife... see him... and talk to him about me... about his papa. And then... then write me about him... about my little man. I'd like so much to tell him... I understand, be at ease. I was a teacher for many years! I'll pretend I have a little student, okay? -Thanks. Pietro, take this! All ready, signor Luciano? -Yes, yes. Let's go, Franco. Leave it here. -No, I'll take it home. You do things big, Mr. Brown! Well, Mr. Brown goes the whole hog! Only thing missing is for you to engage us to make mortal jumps. Why haven't we done some? We've done lots! -Go on, get out. Buongiorno, signor Brown! Grazie, grazie. Had a good trip? -Very! And my Simba, how'd it behave? -Very well, like a lady's puppy. But the baggage compartment is over here, and has to go there. Alto! Silence! Silence, people, please! Please, the radio! Boy, give me the microphone. Here, here. Here's the microphone! Silence. Watch the cables, boys. Silence, people, please, silence. Attention, attention! At the microphone is signor Brown! Hand me a screwdriver. -Here. I've the pleasure to announce, to my very dear listeners in the little world, ever faithful spectators of the Brown circus, that our unequaled troupe is today complete. A hurrah, for our Simba! And a hurrah for the famous pilot Luciano Serra! And now I give the word to The King of the Air! Eh, where are you? The pilot has disappeared. Stop! See he's already here! What sort of secretary are you? If you make me miss the appointment with Luciano Serra, I'll beat the crap out of you! What is it? -The radio. The radio? And what should I say? -Say what you want, one word. Gentlemen and ladies... -Remember you're talking to children. Good morning, dear friends. I love children a lot. Specially those who love lions and airplanes. You'll see if we continue at this pace, next Christmas, with signor Brown's permission, I'll bring you from up high all the beasts you'd want, even hippopotamuses, elephants, and tigers. Bye, bye! Is that okay? Yes, yes, very good, thanks! Long live signor Serra! Oh! Even this is done! Please? Signor Serra. Signor Serra? You spoke on the radio? -You didn't hear that? Well, that'll work. I too use the radio as a telephone. Fine, fine. Watch out you'll dirty your pants. No, it's okay, I'll put on others. So listen, I have to speak to you. I've very important things to tell you. But now I can't. Tonight. -Okay. No, tonight I've two boxing matches. -Ah, you box? No, I take the money. I organize it. I'll see tomorrow, there's no hurry. -O there is! Because you don't know. Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today. So tonight? -Okay, tonight. But can you tell me, a bit, what it's about? Something very delicate. A transatlantic flight. Transatlantic? -Transatlantic. But it's long. -Long? So much the better. Long and difficult. So till tonight. Plaza de Solana, Teatro del Sol. Here's my card. We'll see each other there. And then you'll see a big sign that says: "José Ribera presents..." You're sure Ribera has arranged it? -To me he said he had. I'll go ask him, because I don't think it's going well. Permit me a word? -What? So, did you pay Bulinotto? -Yes, I gave him the money! How must I tell you, singing? -It looks to me the black's serious! Come on! -Can I relax? Sure. -Thanks, signor Ribera. Excuse me, Captain. -Yes? That man asked me, "Are you sure the white man will win?" I don't understand. I paid the black to fake it. -Ah, bravo! ...and suddenly came my stroke of genius. The transatlantic flight. Understand me? -Transatlantic! Yes, yes. It's the magazine "El Mundo Spotivo" that'll promote the transatlantic flight. In a month, when the publicity's done, you, full of gasoline, Vlam! Rome! Thief! Thief! It'd be great if that buffoon's serious. I assure you it'll be worth it. Understand what I mean? I mean I'm right, and that... You haven't lost time. Finally! He who doesn't die is seen again! How's it going, Commander? How's it going, friend? We were speaking in fact of you. Me? The name José Ribera can't be forgotten! But to find you, I had to come here with... Very good! You've already planned the route? Already, the route. On a map like this? Conmander, do you need me? -No, go, go. Good day, Commander. -Adiòs, amigo! Adiòs. Now, as for us. Commander, if you permit. You know I've waited for you every evening at 6, señor? But it's because of this that I didn't come. You're an old fox, eh? You know I need you, and you, you disappear...vanish! Huh? Look, Ribera, can one speak with you seriously? Very seriously! Listen to me... This flight...could let me return to Italy with all the honors. A thing very important to me. These days I've studied the route. I've checked myself too and went to a doctor. What did he tell you? He told me that, despite everything - and a lot's happened these last years, eh? - I'm still up to it. -So, we'll ready. I play my part, and have examined my conscience. Now you have to do your part. O, come on! My conscience is at your disposal like an open book. Who's investing the capital? 15 stockholders, launching "El Mundo Sportivo," the plane is at your choice, the prize at your pleasure. I don't want any prize. I just need an enterprise that can... -Astound the world! Whatever, put it that way. -I'm the man who'll do it for you. Because José Ribera only does enterprises that can astound. Look me in the eye! José Ribera understands perfectly that this is the age of flight! The age of flight! A transatlantic flight Rio de Janeiro-Rome On the eve of the transatlantic flight Serra prepares for the great test. Has the transatlantic flight been postponed? "The flight will be an ideal bridge between the Latin nations," declares the Italian Axis. Sandra, did you read this? -No, what is it? Read, read this. The war pilot Luciano Serra has been called to pilot the Ranyan-Bellanca plane which will soon attempt the non-stop flight... Mama, mama! Did you read? Yes, it's a madman! -No, papa. One can't greet like this news of this sort. We need instead to hope that this time Luciano can finally... Can finally show he's worth much more than is believed here! Aldo! Don't talk like that. Mama, please, let me go. Aviation Field I told them to pass Indian style, and well separated from each other. That way we can better examine each single plane. Ah, Major, look. Here's the first to arrive. Wow! Who is that? - ??, Major. Won't he understand? He comes out too nose-up! Remind him. -Yessir. Major, a civilian's asked to see you, a young man. What does he want? -I don't know, you have to speak to him personally. Says he's the son of Captain Serra. Captain Serra? -Yessir. Where is he, in the parlor? -Yessir. Good morning, Major? -How...?! You read about papa? Yes, that's why I'm here. -Bravo! Come, come. So, we have to see what's to be done and proceed in order. To begin, tell me: you've completed 18 years? Yes, this year. -Good. Well, now, if you want to be an aviator, there's the Academy. Yes, the Academy. Right! But you don't enter the Academy by running away from home. And...you'd need the consent of your father. Or, in your case... A fine mess! Tell me, your mother and grandfather are still in town? -Yes, why? Nothing, that way... Ah, look, I've something to do. You'll see, we'll find a solution. Tonight stay and supper with me. At least we'll not leave you without fruit. Aldo's here with me. I await you. Franco Morelli. Come in. Hey Aldo, see who's here? Mama! -Aldo. Why did you tell me nothing? At least I'd have understood. -Thanks, mama. Excuse me, signora Sandra, I have to speak to your father, not as easy thing. So it'd be better if you two... Aldo, do the honors of the house to mama. Now you're almost one of us. See you later. -Thank you, Major. Commendatore. Dear Major. Very sorry to have made you wait, but I had to speak first with the mother and the boy. Cigarette? -It was most urgent. Thanks. So that means I'm to be scolded, eh? -Scolded? What an idea, Commendatore! Come, come see, Commendatore. Come. Indubitably a magnicent and wonderful sight. They all look crazy up there, eh? Yet they're more maticulous that your company's bookkeepers. Yes, because if your bookkeeper makes a mistake in the accounts, there's always time to redo them. But if one of them makes a mistake up there... In sum, you understand, eh? And that's why they never make a mistake. Care to sit, Commendatore? -Thanks. Today, we're no longer "The pilot." We're Aviation. To be part of our family is no longer enough to have guts, you have to have the clearest and highest sense of discipline. So, if Aldo wants to enter the Academy, he'll need to obtain his father's consent. But he's away. -So! You've prepared him well for life. I hope so! -No, it's true. I know Aldo. And his father is informed of this. During these 10 years I've taken care of it. And it'll be Aldo himself who'll write his father to obtain consent. You well know what Luciano's trying to do right now, and can well imagine what encouragement this news will bring to him. Don't you think? -Yes, yes... Indubitably. For me it's enough one recognizes that, in my way, I've also done things for the boy. And no one will forget it. So, Commendatore, do you want to trust Aldo? Flight postponed again. Tempestuous meeting of stockholders. Transatlantic flight fizzles out! Luciano Serra says he's ready to go. Everything's ready to go! Luciano Serra has set date for take-off! I'm sick of your chatter! You've done too much of it. Enough! I don't intend to risk more money in this enterprise. There! What I've given, I've given, and I repeat: Enough! Calm, please, gentlemen. A bit of calm! We shouldn't get worked up just now when we're about to reap the fruit of our labor. Oh... damn it! Certainly in these conditions, you don't go! What? Not go!? But everything's ready! We can't postpone! I'm not giving more money! It was said the newspaper had to reach a circulation of 500,000 copies! Instead it's not even at 100,000! -You're ill informed! You haven't looked at sales this last week. I assure that as soon as Luciano Serra takes off, circulation will increase tenfold! And your products will be endorsed. Has Luciano Serra arrived? Not yet, signor Ribera. -Not yet... It's you fault, Ribera, you've run out of tricks! -What!? Four times we've postponed the flight, and four times... Your publicity tricks haven't added a single client more! Yes, we see its results! Good evening, signorina. -Good evening, sig Serra. Ribera? -In there, waiting for you. Did you see? We need a bit of faith for each idea, dear friend. Praise of hard work... Here's the announcement. -No, it's not needed, thanks. ...ideal bridge between the new and the old world! Signor Serra, I've bet 10 pesos on the date of your take-off. The flight's postponed! On this we're all agreed, right? Our captain is a nice guy, and a hero too. What would you say... if a beautiful señorita... Well? -In what sense? -Wait, wait! Ah, very good! -What? In sum, "El Mundo Sportivo" should publish on the front page sensational news. What news? Luciano Serra's lost his head for two pretty eyes! No, no, don't do it! And his heart's stayed here! -Don't be in a rush! Am I interrupting? Lucianito! If the gentlemen permit, I too have something to propose. Dear Luciano, I was waiting for you... -Get out of the way! See, the flight for now's not taking place. At least if... At least if I don't lend myself again to your ridiculous game, right? I don't have the patience to wait for your newspaper to increase circulation, The matter is important, you'll see! For you. But not for me! Luciano! You continue being the mediator, you... and don't pay attention to my concerns anymore. It's time to end this merchants' game! You've speculated on my time as you've liked, without consideration, without scruples! Enough now! I was willing to risk my skin in this enterprise, that was in the agreement, right, Ribera? But this ridiculousness wasn't! Understand? Goodbye. -No! No, Luciano! No! No, Luciano! No, listen... You could have spared me this ridiculous meeting. No! No, Luciano! No, no, let me speak. Let me explain. In this flight I saw much more than you can imagine. I understood a bit late that it was just an idiotic joke. What joke, Lucianino? The plane is in top shape. No one knows that better than you. Does gas lack? But we provided for that too, so... You talk a lot but understand nothing, as usual. There's the plane, there's the gas. Now find the pilot, quit bothering me! Who's there? Me, Mario. -Come in, come in. Good evening, Commander. -Good evening. So what's new? While I was working on the plane, someone came from Shell and left me the gas. He wanted a receipt. Know who should sign it? We or Ribera? Because, you know, then the trouble begins and we end up in a sea of troubles. You know you're great? Here everything's a wreck, and you come talk to me about gas and Ribera! But what should I do? -You know what? I don't. -Have any matches? Yes. -Great, so set fire to the gas, Ribera, the newpapers, to hell with everything! We make a big bonfire. Illuminations are in fashion here. What do you mean? I mean it's the only thing left to do. As long as there's the plane, we can't live in peace. But a good fire, wow! Everyone goes their way. -Everyone? You want to get rid of me too? -No, I didn't say that. Ah! 'Cause if I didn't have you... You'd lose the fun, eh? Cause with me life is fun! I brought you the mail. -Put it here. No, because, see, when you told me you were leaving for Italy, I thought: "Finally I'll get back too!" And yet, 72 killos of gas count more that I! And I had to give up my place to 4 cans of gas. Then I consoled myself thinking: "When he arrives in Italy, they'll understand who he is! He'll have a position, and become my holy protector. He'll send for me, I'll depart, in third class, and go to him. And he'll find a place for me beside him. And I too shall have a bit of luck!" Because, you know, Commander... I too hoped this flight would be made! Maybe things would have changed for me too. Well! And instead, it's been 10 years since I left, 10 years I've been here. But if now it's for this, it's better to be a mechanic in Italy, in your own country. At least you're among people you know. But if you, now, give up the flight, who gets out of here now? Am I right? What is it, Commander? Mario, listen, come here. Did I ever tell you about my son? Your baby? -Eh, yes, baby! He's big now, he's 18! And know what he wants to be? A pilot! Him too, like me. He asks my permission to enter the Academy. This is the request, and I must sign it. From babyhood, his mother, grandfather, didn't want it, but it's in his blood. So now, see, they go to the Academy! They're organized, serious, not like back in our time. They take them at 18. And Aldo's now 18. And he was robust already when I left him. And they keep them till they're perfect pilots! And they're hundreds of boys, strong, robust, healthy. And Aldo wants to be with them. Aviators. Him too. Like me. Like us. Aviator! And we, huh? We who've mastered it, and maybe could do something for them, we're here ... wasting time. Look what he writes. "And..., and you, papa? What are you doing? I want to be worthy of you." Read it alone, I can't... Mario! At your orders. -Mario, listen... What did I tell just now? To burn everything? Yes. -No. What time is it? 10:00. -Be so good as to listen. Go to the airfield, prepare everything. Get ready to leave. We leave tonight! -What!? Mario, don't look at me like that, I'm not crazy. Go! I've decided. We leave tonight. Prepare everything, I'll join you in half an hour and explain. -Okay, Commander. -Wait for me! We're ready? -I'm checking oil pressure. -Okay, hurry up. -Yes. Who is it? Don't worry. Don't heed anyone, continue. -Yes. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Luciano! Luciano... Luciano, you're crazy. This is a great headline. Believe me, I pray you, I beg you! Believe the word of Jose Ribera! How can you leave without a compass? Don't worry! I'll manage! No. No, no, listen Luciano: you can't leave. You can't leave! You mustn't leave! Pay attention, we have to discuss many things. We have to clarify everything. Certain enterprises aren't done like this, one moment to the next, without thought. I've already thought. Lots! Go home, Ribera, you need sleep. -Sleep! So, you want to know? The gas isn't paid for. The plane's not paid for... Nothing's paid for! So there! Yes, yes. -I tell you...heart in hand! I know. I've always know. -You know!? You know, and you're leaving!? Then this is an escape! It's a theft! You called the police, eh? You thought you'd stop me! But I'm going anyway! No, no! No, Luciano! -Mario, up! It wasn't me! I swear! No, Luciano! Commander! Commander! Mario! Listen! Commander! Listen, Mario, this goes to my son. Send it right away, eh? Don't forget! Yes, Commander. Remember me. So long, Mario, and good luck! Don't worry for me. Addio! Addio Ribera! Luciano Serra has taken off at 5 minutes past midnight. News! Arrest of Jose Ribera! Unexpected departure of Luciano Serra! A violent storm shakes the Atlantic. Lack of radio make communication impossible with Luciano Serra. "The Augustus" flown over by Luciano Serra's plane. For 3 hours no news of the Italian pilot. Ships along Luciano Serra's route start searching. The ships have suspended the search. Plane wreckage found 3 miles from S. Paolo Island. It it Luciano Serra'a plane? Sandra. A letter. Aldo! Look at the date. The 11th. -His departure! Mama! Royal Aeronautic Academy, Caserta. Entrance application. Serra? Lieutenant, reporting. -What's happening? We've just received orders transferring our Group to East Africa. The privilege of this assignment will permit demonstration of the level of skill reached by the unit. I'm certain you'll share with me the pride of responding, among the first, to the voice of the homeland. Please, give me a light? Of course, monsignor! What "monsignor"! I'm a field chaplain! Want some? Thanks. We were there, the two of us, last Thursday, at the morning battle, remember? -Ah, yes? You helped me carry a wounded man. You also told me I was good for nothing. You put him on your back and carried him off. That was you? -Yes. Right, but you say what you think, I noticed. Where are you from? South America. What were you doing? A bit of everything. Even unloading ships. When you're abroad no one knows you, and you can do every job. What's your name? Alberto Conti. As you know, the line's never been secure. So, while the banditry continues, it'll be us military to guarantee the security of travelers and services. The section assigned to our Group is: Abba Gareb, Mojo, Addis Abada. We'll execute the task in 3-hour cruises. And I recommend, boys: eyes wide open. At dawn we'll reach the Abba Gareb Field, and at 10 leaves the first train. First platoon! Board the train. Squadron going off, eh? Aviation Field of Abba Gareb So, understand the route? You cruise this route for 3 consecutive hours, okay? Okay. But the rest of you have drunk it all! 6 and 3, 9, and one, 10. There! Oh, take it easy! Say, Conti. We've been together 7 months, and you still haven't told me about yourself. Now... Can I ask you a question? -Sure. Why do you always look at the sky? It's an old habit. Why, you're not so happy on earth? In fact, not very. There're too many things on earth I don't like. Quicksand, for example. Watch out you don't fall in! The more you move, the more you sink. So if there hadn't been this war... What's the war have to do with it, excuse me? It's saved many people from it, the war. It's saved me too. If we could all tell our story... But the true one, eh? Are you really sure everyone here uses their true name? Why? Your name's not Alberto Conti? No, no... My name's not Alberto Conti. In my true name I'd promised so many things... So many illusions! And I carried it with me 40 years. I broke pledges. And the last time the stake was high, eh? I'd promised him nothing less than glory! We both ended up in the bottom of the sea. He drowned, and I... I'm here! Aldo! Aldo? Up, up... Water! Water! Go warn them and let me be. Go, go, hurry! Why is it? Who fired? My daughter! My daughter! Papa! Take him away, quick! Down! Get down! Quick! Down! Get down! Well, how's it going, son? Better, but so what? We're 100 against 1000, and sooner or later... We need to have faith in God's help. Yes, I know. And to think on the river there's a plane ready to leave! Just needs a pilot. Conti. -What did you say? We need a pilot. The plane landed on the river, the pilot's wounded. Far from here? No, a kilometer maybe. There, behind the palm grove. I'm going. Tell... Tell Lieutenant Serra that I've done the impossible. Lieutenant Serra? -Yes, he's the pilot of the plane. Aldo Serra? Yes, Aldo Serra. You have bombs? -Yes. -Give me them. But I've only 2! -Give me, I tell you! Don't waste them, few remain. Conti! -Let me go, father. Thanks, Lieutenant. Aldo! Aldo! Aldo! Aldo! Answer me? Come on, speak, tell me something! Aldo... Aldo! Aldo! Aldo! Courage, Lieutenant! You'll see, we'll save them all. What's he doing, is he crazy? -If he is or isn't, it's his affair! Doctor... Is the Lieutenant in serious condition? -No. The bullet passed through without damaging the bone. It's only a strong nervous shock. And this is the legionaire who piloted the plane? -Yessir. We're trying a transfusion, but I don't have hope. But, doctor! Ah, damn! Have I lost my mind..? This is Luciano! Luciano Serra! His father. Luciano! Luciano Luciano. I'm Morelli. Franco! Yes! Franco! Remember? Morelli... The train! They're all getting massacred! They have to be saved! They can't do more! Did you hear? They're attacking the train! Go, launch the entire Group, quick! You deal with it, Captain, I'll be right there. Morelli... Where's... Your son? He's here, look. In the cot next to yours. It's not serious. Aldo... Okay, Luciano. Now stay quiet, let us cure you. Luciano? Luciano! Doctor! Luciano... Damn! Go with the rest! We're saved! Pilot Captain Luciano Serra! Gold medal for military valor. In memory. Ace of the Great War, most able civilian pilot, legionaire in the conquest of the empire, during an action in Mojo zone sighted a search plane enemy fire had forced to land behind their lines, threw himself generously to the aide of the wounded pilot and sacrificed himself to pilot the plane, to complete a war mission on which depended the battle in course. During the fearful action, despite being gravely wounded, he managed to reach the plane, to take off with courageous maneuvers midst enemy fire, and to reach the Abba Gareb aviation field. In consequence of wounds suffered, he died, offering his life in sacrifice for the glory of the wings which, in vain, destiny had tried to keep him away from. A shining example of the highest military virtue. Subtitles: Tag Gallagher, from a transcription by edam17@KG.
