Is this how you wanna live your life? Is this seriously what you want? Yes? Is this how you wanna live your life? Is this seriously what you want? Are you a doctor? Pardon? Are you a doctor? You have a pager. Yes. I'm a doctor. - Don't you have to go? - Only if there's an emergency. Surgeon? Radiologist. - Dentist. - I'm a consulting psychiatrist and a psychotherapist. Interesting... I could use a therapist's advice. My girlfriend just jumped out of her moving taxi. - Not important? - If your friend has problems she should go to a hospital. Listen. You don't know what I'm talking about. But I'll tell you if you want me to. See, my girlfriend has a very special gift. It should interest you. After all, you're an expert. Are you talking about your steady girlfriend? Would that please you? I met Luz in Chile. At a Catholic girls' school. Our Father, why art thou such a dick? You see a girl and reveal your true self. Thy kingdom stinks. Thy will be done, in the crotch of an old grandpa. Let us today go fuck the son of Mary. Ms. Carrara? My name is Bertillon. This is my colleague Olarte. Would you please come with us? - Ms. Carrara... - As kids, we had to draw pictures of what we wanted to be when we grew up. I drew myself as a nun, to get a higher grade. Did you always know that you wanted to be a policewoman? So you speak German. You're a taxi driver? Temporarily. Once, at lunchtime, Luz put her finger down her throat. She puked torrents, right across her table. Luz said she could smell rotten fish. In the afternoon, some girls got sick. After a couple of days, she wasn't the first to puke in the cafeteria. The girls could smell the fish. There was a rash spreading. Some girls caught a fever. At the end of the week, the school completely shut down. Over 200 students suffered from this mysterious disease. The kitchen was checked for germs, the gas pipes for leaks. They called Epidemic Control. You see the kind of gift I'm talking about? You went to a Catholic school? Sure. Those are my favorite. There was a girl who thought she was pregnant. Luz offered her help. I'll give you three guesses why. A medium. I think Luz had wanted to contact me for a long time. I was called to the school chapel at night. The supposedly pregnant girl lay drunk in a circle of salt. - In a circle of salt? - Yeah. It all depends on the kind of movies people have seen. All you need is a personal calling and a receptive medium. - What? Which movies? - And Luz spoke, "Our Father, why art thou such a dick?" That's when I got nervous. "You see a girl and reveal your true self." You see, she'd never talked to me before. "Thy will be done, in the crotch of an old grandpa." I wasn't even sure she knew I existed. "Thy kingdom stinks." I wanted to tell her how much I admired her. "Let us today go fuck the son of Mary." And Luz spoke... "Are you here?" I don't speak Spanish. Can you please stop interrupting? Where was I? We got caught by the janitor. They carried me naked out of the chapel. You can imagine what happened at school after that. Luz got kicked out of school. - And the pregnant girl? - Supposedly pregnant. There was a an argument with the teachers. They officially announced that she committed suicide that night. Luz went away. I got terribly bored. Today, after all these years, I had the chance to talk to her. You're from Colombia? I was just called into Luz's taxi. I admit... I was a little impatient. Our Father, why art thou such a dick? My appearance was less than optimal. The situation was tense anyway. You see a girl and reveal your true self. Thy kingdom stinks. Thy will be done... I should have kissed Luz right away. Luz said... she would take me to the hospital. She touched me. Our Father, why art thou such a dick? You see a girl and... You know what I asked her? "Is this how you wanna live your life? Is this seriously what you want?" Luz jumped out of the taxi. But next time I'm gonna do better. I need your therapeutic support. You might wanna check your pager now. Shit. Not feeling so good? I can help you. I can help you. But you gotta help me too. OK. - Give me your... - You're bleeding. Give me your hand. Bertillon, can you hear me? Dr. Rossini, can you hear me? Dr. Rossini, can you hear me? Dr. Rossini? Yes? Ready? Luz, are you right or left handed? Have you been drinking? Please answer my question. I can write with both hands. Would you give me your hand? Look at the lines on your hand. Concentrate on one spot. As your hand moves towards you, you're becoming aware of your eyes. Close them and sleep. Relax. Your neck relaxes, your shoulders relax. Everything flows. The more you relax, the better you feel. Our Father, why art thou such a dick? You see a girl and reveal your true self. Thy kingdom stinks. Thy will be done, in the crotch of an old grandpa. Let us today go fuck the son of Mary. Luz... I want you to pick a moment at the beginning of your night shift. My voice will accompany you. My voice will become the voice of people passing by, the voice of the radio, and your inner voice. I want you to find yourself in your taxi. Good. All right. Stay like that. What happens next? I can't see. Luz, imagine there's a blind man in your taxi. What would he hear? Calm down. Luz, what's on the radio? Where to? What the hell? I'll take your bags, Ma'am. Luz? Yeah? It's me. Nora. Nora Vanderkurt. Hi. How funny is this? I almost didn't recognize you. I heard you were here. Nobody knew for sure. Is that your taxi? You drive a taxi? Wow, cool. You're a taxi driver. I wanna say... Look at you. Incredible. Listen. Let's talk in the cab. I'm in a hurry. To Hotel Interocéanique, please. I want someone to look for the missing taxi on the road from the airport to Hotel Interocéanique. Call the hotel and ask if a Nora Vanderkurt... How long have you been a cab driver? Two years. Isn't it dangerous? Oh my god. Speaking of dangerous... There was a guy freaking out on my plane. Can you believe that? The police took him off the plane. We had to wait in the plane for an hour. Isn't it a crazy coincidence that we met? - Sometimes it's dangerous. - What? You asked me something. Sometimes it's dangerous. No. I told you... I almost got attacked by a crazy person. Did you have a rough flight? You look a little tired. I do? I slept on the plane. Be careful. Maybe you're coming down with something. Ms.Vanderkurt hasn't checked into the hotel. She left a message. We're investigating the foreign number. Do you have a boyfriend? Or maybe a husband? I'm meeting my husband tonight. He was here on a business trip. - He made this huge deal... - Ask about the husband. Luz, do you have a husband? I don't need a man. What kind of car is the taxi? Volvo 940. What? I didn't wanna offend you. A Volvo 940. - Please keep quiet. - Shut up! OK. I'm sorry. Luz, who's Nora? A schoolmate. She went to my school for a year. - Do you like her? - No. Why don't you like her? If you tell her it smells like fish, she smells fish. I knew it. You poisoned us back then. I didn't poison anyone. I had a fever for a week. Send an ambulance with the search unit. Ms.Vanderkurt might have been poisoned. I didn't poison anyone. Oh yeah? People say you made Margarita miserable. Luz, who is Margarita? Luz, who is Margarita? - My roommate. - What happened to Margarita? - I wanted to test her as a medium. - Medium for what? Lying bitch. Don't you feel guilty about Margarita's death? Do you feel responsible for Margarita's death? How could you do something like that? We prayed for you. You wanna hear how I pray? Our Father, why art thou such a dick? Stop it, Luz. - You see a girl and reveal your true self. - Luz, enough. She takes the Lord's name in vain. She did it before. - I don't want to repeat that. - Are you joking? Thy kingdom stinks. - Luz, enough! - Show that harpy what you can do. Thy will be done, in the crotch of an old grandpa. I cannot repeat that. - Are you crazy? - Be quiet. It's time... Luz, stop it. You called it forth, and now it won't leave you alone. Let us today go fuck the son of Mary. What is she saying? Olarte, I'm warning you. Bertillon, you need to do me a favor. Will you do me a favor? If I can. You must be really quiet now, all right? Really quiet. I need you later. But now Luz needs to rest. Since when do you speak Spanish? Since... it was invented. I can... help you. I'll take you to the hospital. Is this how you wanna live your life? Seriously? Is this what you want? Luz, do you speak German? Do you speak German, Luz? - Yes, I speak German. - OK. Then you can help me. I don't wanna go to the hospital. I wanna go somewhere else. You wanna go somewhere else? - Yes. - Is that why you strangled me? Yeah. That's OK. But let's forget that for a minute. Just for a moment. We'll get right back to that. But let's just forget about it for a second. Could you just tell me where I wanna go? - Where you want to go. - You know where I wanna go. I know where you wanna go. You know, it's funny. If I remember right, I knew that you know. But it's like I just forgot. Sometimes you go to do something, and once you're there, you forget what you came for. I can't remember if I forgot, or if I forgot to remember, you know? But luckily, you know where I wanna go. And now you can take us there. - I know where... - Now you can take us there, Luz. Our Father, why art thou such a dick? You see a girl and reveal your true self. Thy kingdom stinks. Thy will be done, in the crotch of an old grandpa. Let us today go fuck the son of Mary. Are you there? Come here and give me a kiss. Bertillon, let's go. You're too early. Let's go. Watch out. Step. Fuck! Damn it! Stay like that. Stay there. Stay where? Bertillon? Are you all right? Olarte? Stay where? Come give me a kiss. I wrote a song. Wanna hear it? It's not finished. Anyway, you gotta imagine a male choir backing me and... It's not finished yet. OK? Moonshine, moonshine, what you see is distorted. Moonshine, moonshine, the roasted bushes return. Moonshine, moonshine, it casts your spell. There is no night, no shadow for you. There is no face, no name for me. Is there a chorus? A chorus? I think you should write a chorus. I convinced you that you were pregnant. - I wanna go somewhere else... - I love you. Bertillon... Bertillon, can you hear me? Bertillon... I'm begging you... Don't let it... get away. Shoot. Shoot! Shoot! Bertillon... Shoot...
