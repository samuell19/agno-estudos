(dreamlike, cascading electric piano) (sensual breathing) (dreamlike, waltzing music with woodwinds) (music swells) (dreamlike waltz continued) (woman breathes heavily) (woman breathes heavily) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This evening, we intend to undertake the exploration of the innermost mechanisms of the female mind. This is truly a fascinating tool, which is quite... A tool, which is capable of the innermost acts of imagination and achievement. There was a time, of course, ladies and gentlemen, where these sexual fantasies were regarded as (indecipherable); as shameful, as a subject not to be discussed, as a subject to be kept in private, indoors, away from all forms of life and humanity. But my colleagues, of course, and members of the profession have realized today in the 20th century, that this kind of sexual fantasy is a necessary step in helping the female of our species reaching a sexual achievement, as it were, or a sexual pleasure, if you will. For example, one woman making love to one man may find it necessary in her imagination to believe, for sexual climax, sexual enjoyment and happiness, to believe that she, in fact, is being made love to by many men. I recall a time, not long ago in Vienna, a patient of mine, a Frau Hornblower, required multiple partners to achieve sexual happiness. The whole faculty at this time took a particular interest in this case. And I am happy to say that within one or two... one to two months, we had reached a satisfactory solution. How it happened specifically is difficult for me... But I digress. (inhales) Our esteemed Grandmaster Dr. Sigmund put it this way: (chalkboard scrapes across floor) (inhales) The sexual appetite, the id, was opposed by the barriers the ego and the superego. (inhales) When the directional flow of this energy is blocked by the ego and superego processes, it tries to break through the resistance and discharge itself in displacement activity or fantasy. And so, through fantasy, the rational process of the ego and the superego are undermined. And so, to our subjects, each of the women you will see has been a patient of mine. The voices you will also hear were recorded by me personally during the treatment. Each one came to me with a feeling of guilt about their fantasy, and each was brought to an understanding by my own patient labors, I must admit, with the help of my assistant, the very lovely Hilde. Now first, Abby, Abigail. Abby's fantasy was exceedingly common. She was not happy in marriage. She could not overcome the belief that she was not sexually attractive in any way and always regarded herself as an ugly gooseling. Of course, these fears that she had have no basis. None at all, as you will see. But her fantasy allowed her subconscious to overcome these fears. (soothing woodwind music) (Abby, V.O.) I go to the beauty shop once a week and often dream about my hairdresser asking me out for the evening. After we've had dinner and a few drinks, he suggests we drop back to the shop for a nightcap. (lamp switch clicks) (soothing woodwind music continues) (sound of cabinets and drawers opening and closing) (chair creaks) (sound of wheels rolling across floor) (switch clicks) (water sprays) (hairdryer hums) (hairdryer continues to hum) (smooth acoustic guitar and woodwind music) (hairdryer clicks into holder) (acoustic guitar, woodwinds and strings continue) (sound of chair whirling around) (sound of scissors snipping) (snipping continued) (sound of straight razor scraping) (moody electric guitar music) (deep, sensual sighing) (moans) (moans) (moans) (louder moan of pleasure) (moan) (moaning continues) (moans) (moaning intensifies) Very interesting view of common anxiety and how the subject is dealing with it. The beauty parlor, of course, for Abby, has become the panel shop of her own dented libido. Abby's mirror image becomes more and more beautiful and the ugly duckling is transformed into a beautiful swan. Sexual fantasy was her leader. (cabinet slides open) I wonder how many ladies in our audiences have imagined themselves performing outrageous acts in public. If you have, of course, ladies, you must force yourself to admit it, because, you see, this sexual dream releases tension created by childhood where sex and sexuality has been regarded as shameful and sometimes even obscene. Now, Barbara... The next case of Barbara and her husband, who invited friends once a week, or whatever, to play a game of poker. These men arrived and Barbara felt that this act, in itself, was an intrusion into her own married life. Paradoxically, it is in fact these men who provided, for Barbara, the springboard into her own sexual fantasy. (Barbara, V.O.) I guess I imagined myself to be at a small but classy dinner party. About three couples. It's after dinner and there are cigars and brandy. Someone suggests a little strip poker. I guess it's okay with me, but my husband is such a rotten poker player. Cards, gentlemen. (sultry, bluesy saxophone music) One, Bob. Dealer stands pat. (hand slides against fabric) All right, gentlemen, what do you have? Kirby? Bob? Aces against. You lose, Bob. Sorry, kid. (suckling sounds) (indistinct mumbling) That's right. (bluesy xylophone music) (music continued) (necklace clinks onto table) (bracelet clinks onto table) (wet kissing sounds) (fly unzips) (kissing sounds) (Barbara breathes sharply and moans) (moaning intensifies) (gasping and moaning continues) - How many cards? - One. (Barbara moans) (bluesy organ solo) (Barbara moans repeatedly) (moaning continues) (sharp moan) (Bob grunts) (fly zips) And now, Kirby, what do you have? (chuckles) Sorry. This time, eights and aces. My turn with your wife. (up tempo flute music) (kissing sounds) (moody instrumental music) (heavy breathing) (chair creaks) (Barbara moans and gasps ) (moaning continues) (Barbara yelps) (thud) (both laugh) (Barbara giggles) (group kissing and moaning) (group moans) (male groans) (kissing and moaning) (Barbara moans) (chuckles) Contract bridge would be quite absorbing, if played under those rules. Imagine the penalties for failing to make the grand slam! (chuckles) Now, the point of this type of fantasy is that the response of the audience is necessary for the approval and strengthening of the individual's own sexuality. One may reflect on the use of mirrors during the sex act, where the participants themselves are also the audience. And vice versa, the other way around. If you follow my meaning. Recently, women have come to be accepted as equals, but in the battleground of the boudoir, there is still a war to be won. It must be fought on the couches. It must be fought on the sheets. There must be no surrender. (chuckles) But pardon me, I wander from the garden path. Now, Gabrielle, our next subject, feels trapped in her female role and has a compulsion to wear the pants. Her visitor... (chuckles) But you shall see. (somber trumpet and warm organ music) (Gabrielle, V.O.) I'm probably what you would call an everyday housewife. The kids and husband are gone all day and I'm left at home with a lot of time on my hands. Sometimes I think it would be more exciting being a man. Getting out and being able to work, or... whatever. (somber music continued) (music shifts to Latin rhythm with trumpet and organ) (funky electronic music) (footsteps on stairs) (clothesline swaying) (intruder gasps) (footsteps shuffling up stairs) (loud thump) (funk music) (intruder gasps) (fabric rustles) (intruder groans) (clattering) (intruder groans) (whip cracks) (intruder groans) (whip cracks) (intruder groans) (whip cracks) (intruder groans) (funky electronic music) (intruder groans loudly) (intruder groans loudly) (intruder grunts) (clattering) (sultry trumpet music) Gabrielle's fantasy is about role-reversal. In her imagination, the house frau is transformed into a... a rampaging sadist, only to be confronted by the reflection of her true self. At last, she is in command of the sexual situation. She has the whip, and, and she uses it to free herself from the bondage of her home duties. And so... To rape. It's a clich? of male chauvinism that deep down, every woman desires to be raped. A cliche most women are at pains to deny. Even so, the idea of being raped is the most frequent of female sex fantasies. (clears throat) For within the seductive folds of fantasy, Diane, a pretty little secretary, is free to take her own personal excursion into "Nightmare Alley"? (Diane, V.O.) I guess I'm a fairly average female. I think I'm attractive and I'm not dull. I'm nice to people, and most times, people are nice to me. Maybe too nice. Nothing really exciting ever happens to me. (suspenseful music) (yelps) (groans) (boxer grunts) (yelps) (yelps) (boxer grunts) (yelps) (boxer grunts) (boxer grunts) (yelps) (moans) (moans) (moans) (moaning increases) (moans) (pants and moans) (pants) (moans) (helmet thuds) (shoes scraping against canvas) (rhythmic music) (boxer grunts) (yelps) (sinister rock music) (yelps) (yelps) (fabric tears) (yelps) (panting) (boxer grunts) (moans) (music intensifies) (both moan) (moaning intensifies) (moans) (boxer grunts) (moans) (moans) (moans) (moans) (typewriter clacks) The puritanical association of sex and guilt is very strong in this subject. The fantasy is devised so she can relieve herself of responsibility for the sexual pleasure. Significance, of course, of the leather mask, and the punching bag, is not to be overlooked. (typewriter thuds) The fact that the rapist is unseen behind the mask removes any commitment to him, and so the patient can experience paroxysms of pleasure with her anonymous lover. A woman having sex with another woman in fantasy is very common, but of course, does not indicate that the subject is a secret, or a repressed lesbian. (exhales sharply) Francine frequently imagined herself exchanging tender caresses with a dream girl. The antithesis of what she imagines herself to be. Voluptuous. Buxom. Sensual. (Francine, V.O.) I've always lived a rather simple life. Not much excitement. I don't go on dates very often, although I'd like to. Most people think I'm rather quiet and shy. I guess I am. (ambient sauna sounds) (bench creaks) Hi. Hello. It's nice and warm in here. Mm. Yes, it feels good. Your glasses are all steamed up. Let me clean them for you. Here. That should be better. - Okay? - Thank you. You have beautiful skin. Mm, thank you. Do you put a lot of oil on it? Ah, yes. So smooth. You have beautiful breasts. Thank you. Yours are pretty. They look so soft and beautiful. Mm, but I've always wanted to have big ones like yours. And I always wanted to have smaller ones, so I wouldn't have to wear a bra. Mm. Isn't it nice? (moans) - The steam feels so good. - It's relaxing. You have a beautiful body. You're so slim. (Francine sighs with pleasure) You like that? (Francine sighs again) (tender music) (kissing sounds) (inhales) (breathes sharply) (breathes sharply) (steam hisses) Francine is not a lesbian. Her fantasy is narcissistic. Her lover is as she would wish to be. She, in fact, is making love to a dream image. Now, our next episode concerns a fantasy which is more common in real life than in the dream world of the imagination. Imogen first came to see me six months ago. Her imaginary sex life was very limited and inhibited, but after therapy by myself and my esteemed colleagues, we were able... We were able to get to the core of the problem. (Imogen, V.O.) I enjoy sex and I love my husband. He's virile and good-looking, but extremely jealous. He's often away on business. Sometimes when I'm left alone in the house, I will really like to get into some of the things he thinks I get into. (moody, exotic music) (banana peeling) (water splashes) (slurping sounds) (moody, exotic music) (juice splashes) (fruit squelches) (loud slurping sounds) (fruit squelches) (whipped cream can hisses) (slurping) (slurping) (water splashes) (moody guitar instrumental) (underwater bubbling) (bubbling continued) (moody blues instrumental) (bubbling) (glass shatters) In this fantasy, the intensity and variety of real sexual activity has been increased. The woman's combination of fresh fruit and water lifts her into an erotic fairyland containing a whole catalog of tingling and tantalizing situations. The creation of a partner who is overly well-endowed (restrained laughter from crew) (chuckles) is far too common a subject to take up here at the moment. (sniffs loudly) Incest. Incestuous desires are probably dormant in all of us. The strong religious, moral, and ethical taboos surrounding this subject make it ideal for harmless fantasizing. (somber acoustic guitar music) (V.O.) I'm a bit ashamed to admit this, but I have this reoccurring sexual daydream where I have sex with my son. I can't ever remember having incestuous thoughts, though, about my own father and brother. (knocks) (birds chirping outside) Son! Son, you're so dirty! (floorboards creaking) (dog barking outside) (water splashes) (shoe clacks) (water splashes) (water splashes) (water splashes) (water splashes) (water sloshes) Billy went to the foxhole with 17 other guys. He was the only one to come out. His uniform was all cut to shreds. His face was all bloody. And his eyes. It's as if he saw the devil himself. 17 guys went into that goddamn foxhole. Billy was the only one to come out. (water splashes) (water sloshes) Wash me, son. (water splashes) (jaunty electronic music) (water splashes) (water splashes) (sensual sighing) (water splashes) (water splashes) Belle no doubt recalls a fantasy she had as a little girl, but no longer remembers. Most young little girls between the ages of about two and six, have these feelings towards their fathers, or their brothers, or even their favorite uncles. It is not healthy to block this out. Instead, we should use it to decorate and embellish one's own sexual experiences. Celeste, for example, overcomes in her mind the inhibitions of the society in which she moves. (doorbell rings) (Celeste, V.O.) I sometimes imagine myself as a high-class call girl, but I never give my clients what they want. Well, not exactly, anyway. (sexy soul music) Hello, there. How are you? You are a sexy-lookin' woman today. (door creaks) (door closes) It's a little sooner than I expected. Yeah, it's good. It's good timing. Let me get you a drink. (alcohol trickles) (doorbell rings) (door creaks) Hi. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. Get you a drink. (alcohol trickles) (knocks) (doorbell rings) (door creaks) - Well, hello. - Hello, there. Come on in. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. (door closes) (bed creaks) (door slides shut) (sultry blues music) (saxophone solo) (cymbals crash, blues number climaxes) (clock chimes) By imagining herself to be a lady of night, Celeste is able to indulge all the sensations of titillating, tantalizing, but never touching her clients, thereby debasing them. Naturally, as a rational man, I abhor such behavior in my own fellow men and find it an insult to the dominant species. The fact that some men will always find it necessary to pay for their pleasure in this way indicates that the world should follow the enlightened leadership of the Fatherland and legalize such contracts of the flesh. But, onto our next fantasy. The desire to be dominated and humiliated originates with childhood memories of beatings and spankings. However, here... the tables are turning in that Harriet is using a beautiful instrument, her own, ample body, to humiliate this authority figure which once humiliated her. (distant bell rings) (children chatter outside) (Harriet, V.O.) Let's say I've lived a little and I'm not afraid to try something once, or maybe even twice, who knows? But I guess I have a rather strange fantasy. It's like this: I'm back in school and I'm the one with the upper hand. Well, (chuckles) to some extent, anyway. (shoes clack) (playful music) (nails tap) (gum pops) (whip cracks) (thud) (door slams) (teacher pants) This is more than an adult body bursting out of that imaginary school uniform. It is a rampant and irresistible id exploding the barrier of the superego. (folder clacks) (sighs) We come now, perhaps, to the greatest of all taboo areas. The connection of sex with religion. The connection of religion with sex is, even in these permissive times, a fearful blasphemy in the eyes of some. But, similarities between religious rituals and orgiastic sexual practices can be observed. For example, in the laying of the hands for novitiates, once practiced by adherents to the faith. Now, Zelda is a lovely girl, make no mistake. But somehow, religion and sex had become so muddled in her young mind that... (chuckles) Well... You shall judge for yourselves. (solemn organ music) (doors clack) (doors clack) (Zelda, V.O.) I was brought up in a very small, quiet town, where my family and myself devoted most of our spare time to the church. Since I had such a strict upbringing, my sexual outlook tends to be a bit far-out. (doors clack) (organ music continued) (Satanic priest roars) (chanting) (sinister organ music) (yelps) (grunts) Get off me! (grunts) No. (yelps) (groans) (screams) (screams loudly) Ah! (groans) (grunts) (grunts) No. (pants) (moans fearfully) (groans) (Satanic priest groans loudly) (loud groan) (thump) I hear you ask, "Is this wrong?" Perhaps these fantasies are symptoms of frigidity. Surely, a woman should be able to be satisfied by her partner without the use of fantasy. The answer is "no," "no," und again, "nein." You see, the freer the imagination is left to roam, the more orgasmic potential is released. A rich, full sex life requires... no, demands... the use of fantasy. It will, of course, supply a whole new dimension to your sex life. The id must be unbridled. The ego must be crushed! The sensual spirit must triumph! Thank you. (warm keyboard arpeggios)
