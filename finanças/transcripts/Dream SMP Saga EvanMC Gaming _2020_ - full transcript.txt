december 6th 2020. a large obsidian wall surrounds the entirety of lumenburg just two days have passed since tubo had exiled tommy from the nation a day caught in the middle of peace and war but what was a day in the heart of one story would be the beginning of another as deep in the shadows a new threat to the server had just started to grow [Applause] bad stood in awe at what lied in front of him he'd never seen anything like it before a deep red encased the entirety of the strange object whatever it was it made him feel different he thought about destroying the weird-looking plant but immediately got a rush of fear at the thought of doing so confused and scared of his new discovery bad fled the room hoping to find someone else to show the mysterious object as he returned to his and skeppy's mansion he found his friend and fellow member of the badlands sam who was beginning work on a prison nearby with dream quickly bat explained the situation and led the two to the strange red egg do you see that thing in the corner what do you think it is i have no idea but i do not like it it just looks evil i mean it's like dark red no but there's something about it it's just like it's almost like pretty though it is pretty like i was getting ready to mine like a chunk and then oh my goodness again that that vibe coming off of it what do you think it is i don't know should we break it no don't break it i don't want it broken i like it doesn't have like a very very dark vibe though like does it kind of look like an egg to your dream it's kind of weird i don't want to it's kind of creeping me out you're telling me you didn't build this no i found it and it's mine now you know what actually when i originally found it this was not here these little tendril thingies it's expanding yeah that's kind of weird it's mine a little uncomfortable what what's uncomfortable about it this isn't supposed to happen in the game i mean like i've never seen this thing before yeah get out if you don't like it i want you like yeah we might as well leave yeah i guess we'll leave you to it as the three left the room and made their way down prime path sam noticed something growing on the side of the socializing club a deep red vine gripped the side of the building bad jumped with joy at the sight of the vine while sam and dream questioned how it got there in the first place at bad's request they decided to leave the vine alone and continued down the path as they reached bad's mansion another red vine sprouted from the pond outside this was not a coincidence just minutes ago the group stood in that very spot and no vines covered the wall but suddenly out of absolutely nowhere they appeared and bad would not let anyone close to them having had enough of the new discovery and bad strange behavior dream and sam decided to continue work on the prison the bad couldn't seem to shake his new friend slowly the vines crept across the path outside the mansion and onto the other walls new growth was discovered on tommy's tower and throughout the rest of the day bad brought more and more people to see the mysterious egg most felt very uneasy in its presence some even suggesting they tear it down but others were drawn to it unable to avert their gaze from its majestic red figure over the following days new vines appeared and spread across the server nowhere was safe from the reach of the egg bad and ant frost seeking to please the egg planted seeds all around the server hoping to spread its influence as quickly as possible before long bat and ant had gotten captain puffy on their side and together the three vowed to protect the egg and continue to plant new vines around the smp however nearly everyone else grew to dislike the red vines which continued to spread like weeds across everyone's land and on december 9th sapnap and samid had enough of the eggs relentless spread and decided to attack it after making their way down prime path past the overgrowth of red vines salmon sapnap entered the egg room this time the vines covered nearly a third of the room and standing at the center of it all was bad who seemed to be talking to the egg sam and sapnap made their way closer stating that the egg had done enough and it was time for it to be destroyed but bad could never let that happen before long sapnap drew his sword and began to attack driving that away from the egg just long enough for satnap to ignite tnt and sapnap had managed to crack it quickly salmon sapnap fled the scene while bad sturdin shot at his beloved egg this was too far later that day bad brought puffy to the egg to show her what had happened since the explosion the egg had healed but it remained very angry at what sapnap had done and so that and puffy knew they had to do something to protect it and together the two encased the egg in an obsidian shell with the hopes of it being safe forever before we dive even deeper into the story of the egg i'd like to

through wars conflicts and explosions their friendship stood unbroken next to the unending chaos around them but something changed the day bad found that egg skeppy found himself alone in the mansion built for two and in the few times bad did come by to see skeppy he only talked about the egg how he was angry at scappy's wishes to break the vines at their house and how great of a friend it was skeppy felt bad beginning to slip away all the adventures they had all the memories they made slipping from bad's mind in favor of his new best friend skeppy hated the egg all he wanted was for bad to be there but in its presence it seemed even that was too much to ask and so when he noticed bad destroying the very vines that drove their friendship apart he began to have hope once again bad puffy and ant realized that since they covered the egg with obsidian the vines ceased to grow and their obsession with the egg had began to fade away and as this obsession faded the three realized they didn't actually like the ugly vines and decided to destroy them skeppy suggested that they break the egg as well but something inside the three still immediately opposed the idea instead they all decided to visit the egg to try to understand what was happening skepy had never actually seen the egg so when he entered the room to a giant obsidian oval he was a bit underwhelmed curious to see what this amazing egg was skeppy broke a single piece of obsidian to get a peek immediately his friends froze where they stood silent looking at skeppy bad told him that he needed to leave as just him being there was a risk to the egg's safety skeppy was shocked just moments ago his friends were back but now it seemed all progress had been lost bad aunt and puffy had forgotten why they covered the egg and obsidian and destroyed the shell keeping it in skeppy knew what he had to do hiding in a pocket in the vines skeppy convinced his friends that he was learning to love the egg excited about his efforts the three decided it would be good for him to stay there for a while and left him alone a few minutes later bad felt something off immediately he led puffy and ant back to the egg to make sure nothing had happened to it as they entered the room the egg was once again covered in obsidian and skeppy was nowhere to be seen quickly bad realized that not only had skeppy covered the egg once again but trapped himself inside alone with the very monster that consumed the rest of their minds he knew they had to find a way to save skeppy but they also knew that destroying even a single block of obsidian would expose them all again bad reason that the egg was poisoning their minds and before they destroyed any obsidian they needed to figure out what it was as they removed vines around the server bad theorized that the people who liked the egg the most were those who spent the most time in the room with it they all worried for skeppy even more as every second he spent down there was another part of him lost to the egg the sun set and night fell skeppy sat alone trapped with the very evil he seeked to destroy the next morning bad logged on and rushed down to the egg he planned to break just enough blocks for skeppy to get out immediately placing them back before being exposed again and as he made his way to the room he noticed that a few of the obsidian blocks surrounding the egg looked to be corroding but there was no time to worry about that he had to save skeppy and so he got into position here we go scooby are you ready i'm going to get me i'm going oh please get me come out come on come on come on okay okay good oh my goodness good wait what excuse me what what happened to you hello scappy are you are you feeling okay i feel amazing skippy you're red i feel great are you sure do you need some food no i mean i'm i'm glad you feel good skippy but why are you red i spent my time with the egg you were blue yesterday skippy don't you remember i remember everything [Music] wait wait where are you going i want to go in the egg no no no you no no no you don't need to go over here here let let's follow me skeppy i'll take you somewhere else up to the surface the sky you like this guy right the sky yeah the sky you know the sky come on maybe if we get you some fresh air that'll help skeppy had changed bad's best friend the skeppy who stood by his side all that time was gone and in his place stood the shell of a person skeppy no longer cared about anyone or anything except the egg he tried everything to go back inside no matter what bad setter did skeppy didn't care he moved out of the mansion the very place that stood as a symbol of their friendship bad mourned the loss of his friend he tried everything to turn him back to how he was before but nothing seemed to work puffy suggested taking one of his lives but bad refused he could never hurt skeppy he would rather do anything and not knowing what to do he turned his efforts to the egg the source of all their problems following the egg's display of its true power everyone agreed to keep the egg quarantined to prevent any future incidents while they studied it first all discovered blood vines across the server were cleared except for one on punz's tower this way they could make sure the obsidian still prevented the growth of the vines second they needed to buy time as the layer of obsidian surrounding the egg began to dissolve to fix this problem baton ant surrounded the egg with a second layer of obsidian to make sure there would not be any breeches they also created a decontamination chamber at the entrance of the room as another precautionary measure finally because of the egg's strange effect on skeppy bat and ant decided to run an experiment by trapping different colored wool with the egg to see what would happen as the days passed the studying continued the vinyl puns's tower ceased to grow meaning the obsidian was still working the second layer of obsidian also began to dissolve and the wool experiment had some strange results as the final test baton puns decided to tear down the obsidian shell while wearing protective gear to keep themselves safe from the egg's influence once the obsidian was gone they noticed that the egg had grown much larger having absorbed the first layer of obsidian completely this was concerning but they figured the decontamination chamber would keep the egg out while also preventing the vines from growing a few days later bat and puffy returned to see that the vines had completely taken over the room vines reached down from the ceiling and flowers bloomed from the red and ground they started to like the look of the room but then realizing they were being influenced immediately left skeppy had gotten worse his red color became more intense and his love for the egg radiated with every word there was no turning him back aunt explained that the only way to save skeppy was to take one of his lives to break his connection with the egg but bad once again refused to let anything happen to him he stated he would rather sacrifice everyone on the server than kill skeppy and question if bad was infected as well due to his irrational thoughts but bad showed no physical signs of an infection days passed and not much progress was being made the egg continued to push back on being contained skeppy remained infected and they still had no idea what the egg even was and so aunt bad and puffy agreed to hold a meeting on january 14th to discuss what to do about the egg january 14th the dust settled on a ruined lamborgh it had been barely a week since tnt rained from the skies above and today the fate of the egg would be decided the four logged on and one by one they arrived at the table for the meeting i think we all know why we're here don't we as i'm sure you guys are aware of the egg is becoming a problem so i have a proposal for you two why don't you join the badlands what what does it offer us everything the badlands currently is made up of myself aunt frost skippy and awesome dude the reason why we created the badlands faction was to protect ourselves from the chaos that was plaguing the dream smp look at where that's gotten us today okay i don't think it's gonna work with just us for i think we need stronger people but i don't think we should stop there i think i have a long term play i think if we release the egg let it wipe out all of this side of the dream smp let it spread let it wreak havoc across it well we discover a counter to it right we can secure our hold on our territory then come in and once we've figured out a solution clear the egg clear the vines get rid of it and we can take over the entire dream smp we can go from being just one territory to becoming an entire empire i think you turned into a tyrant bed i don't want to take over the whole server i want all of us to take over the whole server if we do this puffy if we do this just right we can come together form a a unified government where all of us have equal say a round table as it will where we all have equal say over how we go about things none of this president's nonsense you know what i don't know if this is the egg talking or myself but i'm craving some chaos this idea you have it's speaking to me i don't know and i don't know if it's you or the egg or what's happening but i kind of want to do it i think i want to help you guys out puffy i'll help you with the egg because i feel as if there's no other way but i don't want to choose a faction as i feel like factions have got us to this point this is what i'm thinking we combine your territory with the badlands territory puffy temp alliance with your territory sure and we can create the formation of our empire what will we call our empire i think our unifying principle right now is the egg tire eggpire i like this then i hereby declare the formation of the temporary but hopefully permanent egg pyre are you guys ready to go release the egg the group made their way to the egg no longer would they contain the chaos the server would once again feel the wrath of the egg and in the wake of its destruction the eggpire would rule everything the decontamination chamber was destroyed setting free the vines that engulfed the rest of the room bad aunt and puns smiled as the plan began to move forward they imagined the chaos that would unfold and were eager for the spreading to begin throughout the rest of the day the members of the eggpire planted seeds all across the server to help encourage even more growth slowly they all began to leave the server for the night but bad remained his plan had been received much better than he initially thought and his disguise had worked even better as bad made his way back to the round table he realized there was no point in hiding it anymore propaganda coded the walls of every building vines spread like weeds as far as the eye could see the chaos was beginning and with the spreading of their message the empire seek to recruit more allies to help them remain in control first bat and ant discussed getting eret on their side because of the power and influence he held as king next they needed to convince sam to join the eggpire in their quest for chaos but this was much easier said than done since day one sam had a bitter hatred for the egg and would not take it well when he found out his equals and the badlands went behind his back and as they expected sam was furious of what they intended to do refusing to join their cause he had just locked dream away in prison to stop chaos and was not about to join some cult to spread more but bad and ant had a plan to make him like the egg a few days later bat and ant attempted to expose tommy to the egg with the hopes of getting him on their side tommy seeking to investigate the egg as a potential threat to the building of his hotel asked ant and bad to lead the way and as they approached the core tommy felt something strange tommy felt an uncontrollable urge to swear literally that's it the egg is saying that all three of us should start swearing the egg just told me to start swearing and that you need to swear next tommy didn't seem to be affected by the egg and in the eyes of the eggpire that made him the most dangerous person to their cause bat and ant quickly decided that they needed to get rid of tommy as he was unable to be controlled by the egg later that day the eggpire gathered for another meeting this time to convince sam permanently already have you guys seen what's happened okay dream is in jail the server is devolving into chaos factions forming everywhere you look this is a problem we need a uniting force we need something that everybody we can agree is is a bad thing to bring everybody together people will think the egg is bad but the egg is ultimately good we all know that anyone who spent enough time with it comes to realizing real life the egg is so bad it's not all right hear me out here's the the ultimate plan okay one by one we bring people to the egg get them to come to our side get them to see things our way let the egg spread its influence let the vines cover the smp when the vines have officially and effectively covered everything that is when we come out that is when we resolve the problem we come and boom your heroes and that's the point it's just we're all gonna do it under the guidance and wisdom of the egg you understand no i don't understand sam i'm trying to get through i i load the egg the egg is awful i don't care what you say i know this is not a good thing the eggpire is not a good thing this was a bad idea from the beginning it's still a bad idea now okay so let me let me make this clear you're in no circumstances willing to back down on this issue no no we should we should not be doing this we should be doing the opposite of this actually all right all right all right that's fine all right what okay goodbye buddy what bed kill puffy oh my god puffy ran shocked at what she had just witnessed and scared for her friend that now stood deep underground in the heart of the egg sam was trapped layers of obsidian stood between him and freedom with every breath he took the egg seed deeper and deeper into his mind it was enough to break even the strongest of wills sam stood at the mercy of the egg for the rest of the night alone with its raw and ruthless power the next morning puffy noticed tommy on her way to break sam out and informed him of what had happened quickly the two made their way to the egg and puffy broke a hole in the obsidian for sam to escape through sam was destroyed he was disoriented and traumatized from the torture the egg had caused him he was starved exhausted and just wanted to go home tommy and puffy just wanting their friend to be okay took him home so he could rest and recover from what happened that night when puffy got back she thought about everything she couldn't believe her friends would do such a thing baton ant had changed beyond recognition ant's eyes now as red as the egg itself she knew that if someone didn't stand up to the eggpire they would overrun the entire server and the friends she once knew would be gone forever quickly a plan began to form in her head a resistance to the unrelenting tyranny of the eggpire because she used to be one of them she knew their true intentions and the ins and outs of their plan making her the perfect leader of the resistance she just needed more people knowing of the eggpire's plan puffy also knew exactly who bad an ant planned to recruit next and so when she caught wind that bad was bringing technoblade to the egg she knew this was the perfect opportunity to get him on her side puffy watched from the shadows as bad and techno made their way towards the egg she waited patiently carefully following their every word until bad began to take things too far and she had to step in puffy explained bad's true intentions the eggpire their plans of unopposed control everything and techno knowing he could never side with an empire sought to tear it down alongside the resistance rambu also decided to join after almost getting trapped with the egg at the hands of bad this was a good start but puffy knew it would take more than three people to take down the eggpire but lucky for them she had a few people in mind having recovered from a stay with the egg and fearing its effect on the security of the prison sam was not exactly a fan of the eggpire and so when puffy informed him of what she was planning he was more than happy to join the cause in a land far away rolling hills of sand painted the landscape as the sun beated down on the dry ground a player stared for months his land lied untouched in oasis in the heart of the sea of sand but that day red vines spread like a disease across his creation foolish was confused he'd never seen anything like it he removed the vines but a few days later they returned he began to hear stories of an egg buried deep underneath the rest of the server stories of a mysterious power that controlled some and drove others to hatred but whatever it was he knew it needed to be stopped and so when opportunity knocked at his door he answered april 12th a large explosion is heard across the server quackity flees the egg room as fast as he can he prayed that his plan had worked he prayed that the tnt was enough he was tired of this egg its influence spreading like a weed across the server and no one there to stop it he knew that if no one else was going to do something he would he didn't have time to see the damage before his escape as he was sure batman puns were right on his trail but he managed to get away and even though the egg withstood the blast of tnt his efforts caught the eyes of the resistance slowly but surely the resistance was growing they just needed an opportunity to strike an opportunity to take down the eggpire for good march 1st word spreads across the server that tommy is dead murdered in prison at the hands of dream everyone was devastated tommy despite the chaos was a friend to all and it seemed a part of everyone died that day too everyone except the eggpire tommy's death was exactly what they needed tommy was immune to the influence of the egg meaning he could not be controlled making him the biggest threat to their plan but now that he was finally gone their plan could move into its final stages first bat and ant managed to trap a new player hannah in the obsidian cage above the egg they hoped that in her time with the egg she would learn to love it and once she did they knew exactly how she could help following the massive explosion set off by quackity the room was in shambles but the egg still stood bad and puns made sure everything was okay and blocked off the room to prevent any threats from entering while the egg was healing this also allowed for concealment while they planned their final move an event months in the making the true beginning of the reign of the egpire the red banquet in order for their true plan to work they needed a lot of people as close to the egg as possible and because their reputation among the rest of the server was not that great they knew that before they hosted an event as elaborate as the banquet they needed to convince people this wasn't just another scheme and so it was decided the red banquet would be staged as an apology an apology for the harm the egg pirate caused and a vow of their good will to the rest of the server but to truly sell the idea drastic action needed to be taken and bad had the perfect plan over the next few days the egg pie removed every single vine that had grown across the server every trace of their mission to spread the egg gone overnight invitations made their way to the farthest corners of the s p people finally started to believe they had changed and the removal of the vines made people just comfortable enough to attend the banquet and as bad made his way down the now completely cleared path and into the banquet hall he went through the plan one last time in his head but then he noticed something out of the corner of his eye his old friend driven away those months ago by the very thing he worshipped the only thing bad still cared about more than the egg skeppy but he wasn't skeppy anymore wait what what what is that scappy what are you doing skeppy why are you over here i want to be next to the egg you can excuse yourself i've given you enough time what do you want i care about you skippy and i mean look we we both know there's nothing wrong with the egg and the eggs great and all but you don't have to you don't have to be buddied up with it then leave me alone oh my goodness let's go for a walk do you want to go for a walk do you want to see the the sunlight you like sunlight here is new to me i've seen all of this a million times over nothing you say will convince me is there anything else i can do for you he's hey skeppy look it's the statue i built of you remember what's it gonna take for you to stop talking to me i'll just go and do the preparations myself okay don't come back you're really getting on my nerves why do you keep coming back excuse me i don't like your behavior lately by behavior give me absolutely no control it's not about me power and everything you say is irrelevant oh my goodness it's not about power it's not about control i'm your friend skeppy i mean you can think that what do you mean well you can think whatever you want in your silly little mind okay no it doesn't matter to me no we're we're friends right sure just leave me alone skeppy i have done so much for you for for our friendship and now you're trying to tell me that we're not friends anymore i'm not saying it i'm proving it you're proving it i literally hey i no i've had enough used your attitude and you i've my best friend my best friend hits me do you know the sacrifices that i have made to hang out with you and you'd rather you'd rather stay any sort of con you you think you've done anything you seriously think that the past doesn't matter it's only about the future and the present and right now i know what i want i want to go to the egg so i'm gonna go no you're not going to the egg i i don't want you to stand by that egg are you gonna are you gonna hit me i'm not gonna let you go to it are you gonna hit me i just wanted us to hang out like we used to like i did all this for you and i don't i just didn't want the egg to take that away you hear how selfish that is you are trying to take away what i enjoy and what i like [Music] destroyed by the tragedy he just caused he remembered what ant said about killing skepy and prayed with everything he had that maybe just maybe his friend could come back april 23rd two days before the red banquet the resistance stands atop a cloud in the sky built by foolish to discuss their plan of action sam informs the group that he managed to recruit hannah after finding her passed out in the obsidian chamber above the egg the group was happy to welcome another member to their side and moved forward with their plan the eggpire had been very selective about who they sent invites to making sure to leave out major threats such as quackity who nearly killed the egg technoblade who clearly had no intentions of siding with them and was very powerful and rambu who was caught spying on the egg with tubbo a few days earlier however everyone who did get an invite decided it would be best to go to the banquet to get information and to seek an opportunity to attack that being said everyone was very wary of the egpire's intentions as they knew there was a strong chance this banquet would end with blood and so they needed a backup plan knowing that they would not be able to sneak armor and weapons into the celebration as they were strictly prohibited sam suggested planting a supply chest in the center of the room in case things went downhill the group agreed and puffy volunteered to hide the chest as she knew the room the best sam also informed the group that he had another plan he had been preparing a plan that could destroy the egg for good finally quackity mentioned a secret contact he'd been talking to a warrior long dormant on the server who was happy to join the fight if things got out of control and with this the group went their separate ways satisfied with their plans and confident that worst comes to worst they would be ready for war the sun cast a red shadow over the smp as it climbed above the horizon deep underground in the heart of a once innocent land hung decorations fit for the greatest of kings red vines reached for the ground chandeliers brought light to the living walls and at the center of it all by the table waiting to be set for the feast the eggpires stood in the ruins of their meeting room far above the egg in silence no words needed to be said the plane had been trapped in their heads for weeks on end and everyone knew what needed to be done joining them was punk who had always liked the egg but after a bit of convincing took a greater liking to their plan but one seat lied empty as their newest member was attending to her own part of the plan the clock continued to tick until it was time and as the first guests began to log on everyone made their way to the banquet [Music] hall [Music] [Applause] [Music] i really appreciate you all coming again uh i think this is the perfect opportunity for us as as a server as a community to come together and and honestly just to let bygones be bygones to let any past issues to set them aside so that we can we can grow and advance from this point forward because while there have been bumps along the way in the spirit of you know moving things forward i would just like to say that i was very very happy that we were able to gather everybody here together for what is i'm sure going to be a banquet that none of us are ever going to forget and yeah thank you for coming everybody thank you prepared what lava fell from the ceiling blocking all escapes from the room everywhere except the egg months of planning led to this moment the final sacrifice puffy and the rest of the resistance were furious they trusted their friends one last time and they still betrayed them they hoped it wouldn't come to this but the empire had to go puffy made her way to the center of the table to the hidden chest of supplies finally the empire would answer for their crimes but then what what oh oh what we're used to looking for this per chance there's no way what what i had to tell them you told them hannah what why the egg hannah heard everything every step of their plan every precaution they plan to take everything ever since her stay with the egg she was consumed by its transcendent power and bad new that as a new player to the server she would be the perfect spy the resistance was powerless in the face of fear they had unknowingly supplied the eggpire with the very weapons that would cause their demise but sam still had one last plan that is tragic that you told him about our plans for the armor but something you should know i had another plan because i didn't trust you what do you mean another plan well i think that we all can agree this has gone on long enough now i'm tired of all this fighting so i say we just blow the egg up we're good this time but with an amount of tnt that it cannot survive but you don't have any wait no no no suit why what what what you really thought you could defeat the egg with tnt after quackity tried that we took proper preparations and we made it so that we wouldn't have to worry about tnt anymore now uh if you would all kindly please make your way over here we can uh begin the summary executions what the the what no no no no no no no no no no come on what you see the egg needs something and it's gonna get it from each of you see in order for the egg to hatch it needs energy and it gets that energy by people dying near it and that's the role that you guys are going to fill we're going to kill you one by one oh what what did you say here you're an absolute monster i'm a monster you know what i think eric you would be a perfect person to sacrifice first excellent excellent i really appreciate you guys following the directive and not bringing any weapons that's very courteous of you we trusted you well that was your first mistake what do you what you think we were really going to just stop trying to spread the eggs influence over the server just because a couple people got mad at the vines like come on that's been the objective all along is to hatch the egg the egg wants power and it's gonna get it all right stop i have had enough i am sick of this foul red stench i am tired of this endless cycle of egg nonsense i try we tried to give this dreadful egg another chance yeah i think why don't we start with foolish instead we'll save uh the monarchy for later don't think we've forgotten about you but we'll we can start with foolish youtube bad and this is your last chance with me your very very last i am done after this what are you gonna do you're weak you have nothing buffy you were a part of the empire you could have prevented and look what you all turned into i did what i needed to to make sure that everyone else was protected because all you and dad care about is the egg and yourselves you're selfish puffy you could have stopped this if you stay with the empire but this is your fault what one down and a couple more people to go who should we do next what do you think stop what you're doing right now stop stop it hey hey hey hey relax relax bad quackity i am i know what you're doing here but stop right now stop right now look at what you've done here bad this is this is impressive i'm not gonna lie this is quite impressive everything you've done here you have to stop right now bad you have to stop stop this whole egg thing is just getting out of control you just killed a man is that what you wanted to do bad is that it was that your plan all along to kill innocent people this has gone completely out of control and i'm not gonna have it anymore bad look what you've done just look what you've done you've trapped all these people all these innocent people and what you've disguised as a party i'm telling you that you're a pawn to power you're nobody bad you're working for something that quite frankly doesn't even care about you i mean look at the egg look at the egg look at what it means it doesn't mean anything how about we just stop playing games bad how about that i can't stop quackity and you know why i can't stop you're not like this yes i am so how

against as an anarchist and if i don't stop it now it'll be the end of the world so yeah i'm working with quackity we still outnumber you it's four against three puffy saw an opportunity a moment of weakness the very thing she'd waited for since the start of the resistance and having had enough of the friends she thought she had she took it and frost you're dead wait what what what are we stopping where did puppy get away you're taking my kindness weakness oh i've always told you i've told you for so long this stupid egg thing is just bringing trouble nothing but trouble bad let's go as the eggpire retreated into the labyrinth of tunnels surrounding the room the people stood frozen shocked at the events they had just witnessed the murder of their friend quackity stood atop the egg no matter what happened the eggpire was reduced to nothing and their crown jewel now lied in the hands of the resistance quackity led the people to the surface freeing them from the evil grasp of the egg over the next month the server would attempt to recover from that day sam and quackity sealed off the egg quarantining it once again that an ant felt a weight lifting from their shoulders as their color returned to normal and their love for the egg diminished the resistance went their separate ways vowing to return the day the egg was released again and the egg remained locked away a mere memory of a time a dark time the server never wished to see again and with peace finally ruling over the land the egg it seemed would have to hatch another day [Music] you
