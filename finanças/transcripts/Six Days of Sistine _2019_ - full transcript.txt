(Metal clanking) (traffic whooshing) (people chattering) - [Jean Baptiste] The colours in which we love are here. There and everywhere. (Gentle music) (traffic whooshing) (traffic whooshing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (man sniffs) (eerie whooshing) (gentle music) - [Sistine] An ember sparked will softly glow and fed by fuel will grow and grow. I once was cinder sparked by you. First timid till the flames then grew. And so our start with touch of dawn with amber hue for I was drawn to eyes so welcoming and warm. I never guessed you'd do me harm, like morning glory, love in June. The rapture of mid-afternoon. Romance of which the ancients wrote, our passion had no antidote. And with the dusk, though scarlet tinged, our love began to come unhinged. For clouds arrived which filled your eyes, extinguishing bright twilight skies. With cold of night came shadows pall, And I could not tear down your wall. By midnight's hour, the fire was dead, mere ashes smouldered in its stead. You left, and should you reappear, I vow to shun you. Now I fear the very thing for which I yearn, one touch and then again, to burn. (Woman sighs) (speaking in French) (speaking in French) (speaking in French) (speaking in Spanish) (speaking in Spanish) (speaking in Spanish) (both laugh nervously) (speaking in foreign language) (laugh nervously) - [Jean Baptiste] Find me where the summer breeze is sighing. There, time floats me in its endless sea, engulfed I am by sweet tranquillity. On a lovely esplanade gulls flying, a trailing clouds through azure, wheeling free. Sun flashes gold its grin, there you'll find me. (Soft, intense music) (happy, gentle music) (people chattering) (upbeat music) - [Jean Baptiste] When loves comes pounding on a drum it comes on hard and fast and strong until two hearts in sync beat passions song. - [Sistine] Sometimes love comes clanging down the tracks. It clashes or it clamours to be heard. So as it crosses, meaning it's obscured. - [Jean Baptiste] Other times loves lurks or it attacks. Unrequited love can pierce or burn until it's ventricle turns into black. - [Sistine] And then our times love gently climbs or eases sure-footed to one's door or sweetly seeps the saturated soul. - [Jean Baptiste] It's strong and yet it's soft. It doesn't sting or snip. It listens. And reverberates the whispers of the heart. - [Sistine] To hear the surf, of trill of spring's new birds. The cat's soft purr or strong and stirring words. Endearments whispered, songs so cute I grin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. To see the sun, full and gorgeous on the sea. An unexpected rainbow over me. A moving scene, glad faces of my kin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. To smell a rose, sweet lavender in bloom. Popcorn at the movies, favourite perfume. Aroma of Mum's cooking once again. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. To taste delicious food when out to dine. Ice cream on my tongue, a lover's mouth on mine. Cold drinks, desserts as chocolatey as sin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. I feel a gentle rain, snowflakes on my nose, ocean's breeze, the tides, the sand between my toes. (Gentle music) (gentle music) (people chattering) (people chattering) - [Sistine] The place in which my parents fell in love, how I got my name, the chapel they did meet. And forever was never the same. (People chattering) (footsteps tapping) (train clanging) (people chattering) (children chattering) [Sistine] Such contemplating that the poets do. They sing of God, our spirits to renew. With Mother Nature often there in their tune and offer up their verses to the sun and moon. They praise the sunset over the blue lake, while pondering man's purpose as they ache. They ache for all that earth can never be. Through dreams they've lost and for humanity. And when they ache their words are filled with pain. Which pour out from their soul like cleansing rain. (Traffic whooshing) (people chattering) (train clacking) (train wheels squeaking) (people chattering) (doors closing) (traffic whooshing) (dramatic music) (engine revving) (gentle music) (slow piano music) - [Jean Baptiste] An ember sparked will softly glow and fed by fuel will grow and grow.

I never guessed you'd do me harm. Like morning glory, love in June. The rapture of mid-afternoon. Romance of which the ancients wrote. Our passion had no antidote. And with the dusk, though scarlet tinged, our love began to come unhinged. For clouds arrived, which filled your eyes. Extinguishing great twilight skies. With cold of night became shadows pall. And I could not tear down your wall. By midnight's hour the fire was dead. Mere ashes smouldered in its stead. You left, And should you reappear I vow to shun you. Now I fear the very thing for which I yearn. One touch, and then again. The burn (gentle music) - [Sistine] An ember sparked will softly glow and fed by fuel will grow and grow.

(Slow piano music) An empty field left open and inviting, somewhere for us to be we find exciting. Unlocked and open, the birth of freedom. (Slow piano music) - [Jean Baptiste] How could I not follow, an angel is Sistine. How calm she is. How comforting. On the other side of my own fence, she's the grass most coveted in green. - [Sistine] In spite of everything with which I'm dealing, how strangely wonderful I am feeling. To find this man in all of London, seeming so like me, that deep connection, instant chemistry. A stranger, yet a kindred spirit in his eyes I see. I lead, he follows. He doesn't question anything I say. His fingers lightly graze my skin. Our fingers interlock. Kindred souls, we sleep inside the car, then waken to embrace a brand-new day. We drive, we walk, we have no need to talk, we simply feel. Jean Baptiste, there are no words to say. (Slow piano music) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (sigh) (up beat song) (slow piano music) (up beat song) (slow piano music) (up beat song) (slow piano music) (bright pop music) (slow piano music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (doors opening) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (doors closing) (birds chirping) At the end of the rainbow, dreams unfold. And some people say there is a pot of gold. How well I recall a rainbow one day, that shone in the sky when a storm went away. Rain pelted my car, I felt so afraid, but as I neared home it started to fade. The sky once so dark grew more and more blue, I thrilled next to see a rainbow arch through. It bent over towards the mountains so beautiful. A peace and great joy welled up inside my soul. No pot of gold at the end did I see. But still there was gold and it beckoned me. The mountains were gilded with bright gleam. This is magic that makes poets dream. When I got home I took paper to pen and wrote of that beauty, God's promise to men. Again, I recall how my soul lifted at the rainbow's end, God's love gifted.

The style to choose from are more than few. (People chattering) Some choose simple two-step, some move with flair. Some slow dance, some break dance, devil may care. Some freestyle, while others just dance on cue. Some tango with zest, some shuffle soft shoe. Others glide easily, waltzing on through. Some change their partners, some stay one pair. Life is a dance. You start with the styles in your own milieu. Then grow as you add on new moves you view. You stumble (laughs) but sometimes dance on sweet air, just keep the beat. Try new steps if you dare. The way you end up is all up to you. Life is a dance. (Eerie music) - [Sistine] Life is a dance we were all born to do. The styles to choose from are more than few.

(Birds cawing) (sober music) (gentle music) (gentle sultry music) (dramatic music) (people chattering) - [Woman] And so, I think you should do. (Eerie whispering) (dramatic music) (wind whispering) (birds chirping) - [Jean Baptiste] At last you've come for me, my love, my sweet. You've come through tranquil woodland with the breeze along that path where once we used to meet and with the sunlight streaming through the trees. With passion in your eyes and wings for feet, you've come for me and all my anguish please. You are so near. I hear your wild heartbeat. You've come for me. My own wild heart to seize. Alas, the woods have vanished with the gleam of my waking dawn. It was but a dream. (Tranquil music) (birds chirping) (laughing) To hear the surf or trill of spring's new birds, the cat's soft purr or strong and stirring words, endearments whispered, songs so cute I grin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. To see the sun fall gorgeous on the sea. An unexpected rainbow over me. A morning scene, glad faces of my kin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within.

To feel a gentle rain, snowflakes on my nose, oceans breeze, the tides, the sand between my toes. The sun's warmth. The heat of passion on my skin. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. To feel inside me such a happy glow that it radiates to everyone I know. The love that lets me know life is win-win. My heart sings out as joy wells up within. - [Sistine] Yes, love is even truer when we see past the frailties accepting all. Our dog and cat friends don't mind if we have flaws. Real love means breaking down the walls. The friends who we hold close to us are those who love us as we are. But there is too a love that happens, suddenly and grows. Dawn overtaking night as it bursts through. Love's every colour ought to offer peace, like lover's sweethearts or of a man and a wife. But even those desires we know most cease, are unexpected sunbursts in our life. - [Jean Baptiste] Sistine, I thank you for your gifts to me. I needed some assurance and in that way uniquely yours, you showed me what to do. You helped me to escape predictability. If not for you, I'd have not been set free. My simple gift, Sistine, is a red rose for you. (Wind whooshing) (birds chirping) (engine revving) - [Sistine] He shines like silver moonlight moon, cool marble statue, this tycoon. And though he makes the ladies swoon, of ice he's hewed, of ice he's hew. He's poker faced and can deceive competitors and can achieve most anything. But can't conceive of Genevieve, of Genevieve. Like Neptune, distant from the Sun, relationships he chose to shun. He thought the search for love was done. He has no one, he has no one. Now, love's allure has come his way. What will he do? What will he say? Will he grab hold, beg love to stay? Or let it stray, or let it stray? This dragoness disguised in lace, passion's flower, with angel's face. Precisely picks the time and place, each dream to chase, each dream to chase. Like ink, the colour red she stains the hearts of those whose love she drains. And then she leaves with nought remains, no lush she feigns; no lush she feigns. And now there's one who would suffice for him alone she'd sacrifice, her everything. So he of ice she must entice, she must entice. So Genevieve now strikes the flame, will man of ice his love proclaim. Beneath her fire and his cold frame, they're both the same, they're both the same. (Gentle sombre music) Another year has come, chillingly, and more chillingly for me than in decades heretofore. I watch and ranting from my window as I recall. The year already past has tugged me from those tame and toasty days when I lay face up to the sun, dreaming that my summer would never end. It brought me to this winter, when it withered up and died and half a century and more of memories had fallen from me by now. Like pretty crystal flakes they fell, drifting through my mind. Places, events and people, all those people I looked up to in my youth, fallen as the snow. How many pretty snowflakes have melted away. Only my memories of them remain. Memories now piled up like snowdrifts in my brain. Yes, the newborn year has arrived, just one month old already, it has lost it's cruel. This infant's ageing process paralleled on the larger scale, that fleeting span of time known as life. A time all the living undergo. The new year carries on as must we all. To soon complete its cycle. Let it blister, let it wail. Let it rattle at my door, for soon enough all signs of it will cease. (Birds chirping) - [Jean Baptiste] On you the angels did bestow a glow, your friends would come to know as star shine. For even stars cannot outshine your countenance. It's as divine as starlight. Oh, how you hush those stars my dear, from brightly shining when you are near. As starstruck, I too am stricken by your sight. I'd love to be with you all night to stargaze. Shine on sweet man, but do not burn to long or strongly. The stars might turn to stardust. (Eerie music) (eerie whooshing) (bells tolling) (eerie whispering) - [Woman] Tried you a few times but, I can't get through. (Eerie whispering) (bells tolling) (dramatic whooshing) (gentle music) (bells ringing) - [Jean-Baptiste] It hovers here, the moon opaque, obscuring mountain trails I take. No other living things appear. A moon opaque, it hovers here. I follow, along a ledge. Below a swirling river's edge. In front of me, the canyon's yawn. Along a ledge, I follow on. I see no hue when fog congeals. Oh, doom of one who no more feels. The moon has fled and so have you. When fog congeals I see no hue. Now all is dim, it matters not. My dear one's heart, I have not got. No use in living without him. It matters not. Now all is dim. At peace I'll be if I should fall to murky water from this wall. Oh, yawning canyon, swallow me. If I should fall, at peace I'll be. (Bright music) - [Sistine] It hovers here, the moon opaque, obscuring mountain trails I take. No other living thing appear. A moon opaque, it hovers here.

(Dramatic music) (eerie whooshing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (blow thuds) (Jean-Baptiste groans) (people chattering) - [Sistine] He wanted to step up and be a man. He didn't realise he didn't have too. His mind filled with such fantasy, when all he needed was self-respect for the things he has. A punch, a hit of realisation. He needed to reassure himself of his choice, his need to further his life and not live in fantasy. This man, this Buck, this threatening figure imposing opposition to his need for escape. (Wind whooshing) (Jean-Baptiste sighs) (eerie music) (birds chirping) (gentle sombre music) Words I've never spoken, are those I'll never write, like words I might recall, the glow I felt when night, one choice, lifetime's fragment I took for paradise. The time for which my memory alone could not suffice. One summer's whispered end, your feel, your touch, your scent, your lashes on my cheek, the pure enrapturement. Your hands and hair like silk, your pause to gaze on me, they seem more an illusion now than past reality. Words I've never spoken or those words I'll never write. Like words that might recall the glow I felt when night, no words can bring to life the fleeting ghost of you. You haunt my empty hours, there's nothing I can do. For if you think of me, I guess I'll never know. And how you made me thrill no words can ever show. Words I've never spoken are those I'll never write, like words that might recall the glow I felt one night. (Eerie music) (Jean-Baptiste sighs) (birds chirping) (water gurgling) (aeroplane engine buzzing) (gentle music) (engine revving) You didn't try to fix me, Jean Baptiste. You let me fall into your arms releasing pain. How patient you have been, how very sweet. A stronger woman I have become. Since knowing you I've learned to kiss the rain and in my dreams, Jean-Baptiste, I'll see you again. - [Jean Baptiste] Like multi-colored flowers in the wild love blossoms in a vast array of hues. What joy the mother feels when her sweet child inside her arms looks up at her and coos. How necessary is this first deep bond, to everyone. It nourishes the heart. - Okay go and say hello to mummy, go on - Going to say hello to me. - [Jean Baptiste] For as the child matures, he sees beyond familial bonds. Love's landscape is our art. - [Man] Tell Mummy how happy you are to have her home. (Sistine laughs) - [Jean-Baptiste] In soft or brilliant colours we choose to paint the different forms of it that we may find. And love may be a harlot or a saint. But when it's true, it chooses to be blind. - Hey, hey. (Man laughing) (both laughing) (baby crying) - Oh. What's that, being noisy. (Sistine laughing) - [Jean Baptiste] In solitude I watch the clear, blue sky. Leaves flutter on the grand, majestic oak beneath which I'm sitting. Swallows fly around me swooping. Now I hear a croak. A sound that I am sure I'd never hear if I were on a busy city street. I stand and walk around. The sound is near. The feeling that I get is rather sweet and finally I spot there on the pond, a tiny frog that's serenading me. (People chattering) - [Woman] I've been thinking that. - [Jean Baptiste] Crops rippling in the breeze. I see beyond my shaded spot. I soon must leave my tree. At sunset I've watched before I creep into the quiet of night and back home to sleep. Words I've never spoken, or those I'll never write. Like words that might recall the glow I felt one night. (Gentle music) One choice, lifetimes fragment I took for paradise. The time for which my memory alone cannot suffice. One summer's whispered end. Your feel, your touch, your scent. Your lashes on my cheek, the pure enrapturement. Your hands and hair are like silk. Your pause to gaze on me. You seem more an illusion now than past reality. Words I've never spoken are those I'll never write. Like words that might recall the glow I felt one night. No words can bring to life the fleeting ghost of you. You haunt my empty hours. There's nothing I can do for if you think of me, I guess I'll never know and how you made me thrill now words can ever show. - [Sistine] He saw what he wanted to see, these men his ultimate enemy. For they were not there for me. This man, singular, I hope some forgiveness he'll give me. His car returned, peace, I think he'll be. - So this is a new client for our business and they are bringing a new rebranding project to our business. They're looking at rolling out a very marketing brand of peace and serenity, nice of you to join us. John, this is Buck, Buck this is John. So they're looking at a very blended approach. They need strong commonsense mind you. So they've already come up with some initial themes, some of those themes, child, dove, peace, serenity If you come across we can talk about some of the strategies and where they come for it. Buck I would like you to take a bit of a lead on this - [Jean Baptiste] At peace I'll be if I should fall, to murky water from this wall. Oh, yawning canyon, swallow me, if I should fall. At peace I'll be. (Water gurgling eerily) (woman speaking faintly) (dramatic music) I didn't know Sistine at all when I first saw her reading on the park bench. How can I explain all that she's been in what were six days of Sistine have meant. We bared the purest part of ourselves to one another. Whatever happens in my future there will be no other whom I will look back on with such tenderness. Thank you. (Gentle music) - [Woman] Hey Hon, I'm back. I hope you had a few good days without me. I tried calling a few times but I can't get through. I hope it's okay I called your work phone. Look, I've been thinking that the Courtyard is gonna be fully booked for months on end and so I think we should take the Ivy while we can. Dad said he'd front the deposit so at least we know that the reception will be shared with all our friends. Also, you need to get fitted for your tux, so let me know and I'll arrange for you. Oh, and the cake, decide on a cake, will you, please (laughs). I've sent you many photos so please decide. Love ya. (Slow violin music) (woman sighs) - [Sistine] Oh how I love my time with Jean-Baptiste. An attractive man, well suited I first could see the epitome of someone regimented in his thinking. But in the din of city life, Jean Baptiste was sinking. Despite all that, I could see at least there was a spark in him, and in a while, this man once quiet and withdrawn, brought my soul to life and made me smile. He looked about for something that he could not find. But it was there before him all the time. With freedom and a newly born tranquillity, he found his own truth. How trusting and how sweet is he. This kindred spirit, who like me, needed comfort in our mutual search for clarity. (Gentle music) - [JeanBaptiste And Sistine] I needed you, you needed me. And when I saw your face, tranquillity enveloped me. Thank you dear for being there. Thank you for your grace. (Man vocalising) (intense piano music) - I love you. - No you don't. I was just good for you and you were good for me. We helped each other realise what was important. That sometimes moments of reinvention are a good thing. (Speaking in foreign language) Helps you realise who you really are. - No. Love is like a colour wheel, Sistine. The way we feel about our family, the way we feel about our partner, the way we feel lust. Monotony Passion. Desire. Comfortability. Friendship, trust. - To me love is not just one thing. - Different love is like colours, you and I just found the one that matched at the right time. - In that case, I love you. (Upbeat music)
