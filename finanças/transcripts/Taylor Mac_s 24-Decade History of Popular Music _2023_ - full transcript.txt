I was born four years after the Stonewall Riots. All the songs that we're gonna sing in this decade were on the jukebox in Stonewall at the time. I don't actually know if that's true. Who started the Stonewall Riots? ♪ Ooh-ooh... ♪ The most fun story is that Marsha P. Johnson was hanging out at Stonewall. And the cops come to arrest the queers, just because you're who you are. ♪ Ooh-ooh... ♪ And Marsha took a shot glass. She threw it against a mirror and it shattered, and they said, "It was the shot glass heard 'round the world." ♪ War, children ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ ♪ Ooh, the fire is spreading ♪ ♪ On our very streets today ♪ ♪ Burning like a red coal carpet ♪ ♪ Mad bull has lost its way ♪ ♪ War, children ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ ♪ War, children ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ ♪ It's just a shot away ♪ The show is about our history as Americans. That history is in our songs. It's what happens when history is filtered all through one body. I love the idea that a queer body could become a metaphor for America. ♪ Yeahhh! ♪ Yeah! Singing has just always been... My mom, she sang around the house, you know, all the time when we were kids. So it's just been a part of... my life. And when I was thinking of a form that would best represent our history, it just seemed like popular music was the thing that would tell the story the best way. So we're gonna do a transition into the next decade right now. We've been working on this show for over ten years now. We took it out on tour as four six-hour shows. I knew I wanted to do the whole show as a 24-hour performance, but I only wanted to do it once. Hello, everybody! Today, tonight and tomorrow, we are making a 24-decade history of popular music. I didn't know if I could do it. I would be singing basically nonstop for 24 hours. ♪ Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony ♪ ♪ Stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle keep it up ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle dandy! ♪ ♪ Mind the music and the steps ♪ ♪ And with the girls be handy ♪ I was dreading having to start our show with this decade because most of the music that has survived is patriotic music from the American Revolutionary War. And maybe you can tell from the way I'm dressed, I'm not exactly an unironic patriot. ♪ Father and I went down to camp ♪ ♪ Along with Captain Gooding ♪ ♪ And there we saw the men and boys ♪ ♪ As thick as hasty pudding ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle keep it up ♪ ♪ Yankee Doodle dandy! ♪ ♪ Mind the music and the steps ♪ ♪ And with the girls be handy ♪ ♪ And there we saw a great big gun ♪ ♪ As large as a log of maple ♪ ♪ And every time they shoot it off ♪ ♪ It takes a horn of powder ♪ ♪ And makes a noise like father's gun... ♪ Uh-oh, that's sad. ♪ ...only a nation louder ♪ ♪ It scared me, so I hooked it off ♪ ♪ Nor stopped as I remember ♪ ♪ Nor turned about till I got home ♪ ♪ Locked up in mother's chamber ♪ This is the song I'm supposed to feel patriotic about? A song that makes fun of effeminate men? But then I did a little research and it turns out that this song was a British song. The British wrote it to make fun of Americans 'cause they said we were effeminate, which is really saying something coming from the British. Not only were we effeminate, they said we had no fashion sense... ...which is kind of true. But then what happened was the Americans won a battle and we pointed our bayonets at them and we made them dance and sing "Yankee Doodle Dandy" over and over and over again. And that's how it became an American song. Dandy revenge! Please welcome the Dandy Minions, all through the house. They're here to perform random acts of fabulousness. Taylor was like, "Look, I'm looking for a co-director. "I'm working on a 24-hour performance art concert, which is a radical fairy realness ritual." It is a radical fairy realness ritual sacrifice! The gathering, the event, that is the ritual. The audience is the sacrifice. We didn't want to be the only ones dressed up this evening, so we brought some drag, and the dandies are going to pass that drag out to you all right now. It's a ritual that asks us to move closer to our queerness, and to practice empathy, and most importantly, I think, practice joy and exuberance and maximalism. Hey, ready? Supermodel! A lot of people would say, "Have you ever thought about making traditional work? I don't know, a-a kitchen sink drama with a couch?" And I always thought, well, the Ancient Greeks wore platform high-heel shoes when they would perform, and they had masks on, and sometimes when I'm in my drag, I just feel classical. The project started with the idea of making a show that was a, a metaphorical representation of the AIDS epidemic, specifically about how communities build themselves because they're being torn apart. ♪ Fare thee well ♪ ♪ My own true love ♪ ♪ Farewell ♪ ♪ For a while ♪ ♪ I'm going ♪ ♪ Away ♪ ♪ But I'll ♪ ♪ Be back ♪ We start with 24 musicians on stage, and then every hour we lose a musician. ♪ Can't you see ♪ ♪ Can't you see ♪ ♪ That lonesome dove ♪ ♪ That lonesome dove... ♪ And at the start of the show, we have all the sound, and slowly it diminishes, diminishes, diminishes. ♪ He's weeping for ♪ ♪ His own true love ♪ The concept came from the AIDS epidemic, that... you fall in love and then somebody's gone. ♪ Come he back ♪ ♪ My own true love ♪ ♪ Come back and stay a while ♪ ♪ If I had a friend ♪ ♪ In all the earth ♪ ♪ You've been ♪ ♪ A friend to me ♪ Machine and I are going to change! Bring down the screen. When Taylor first came to me and said we were gonna do this 24-decade show, I got totally inspired. I was like, "Oh, my God, I get to make 24, like, historical, like, period costumes, but my way." So this is Crazy Jane. She lives in a whisky barrel. She has a toothbrush. She has her dildo. She has everything that she needs. She's crazy. I'd never tell Machine what to do. - You're crazy, girl. - Crazy, Crazy Jane. I'll say, "This is what the decade's about. I'm gonna sing songs that were popular in pubs in 1796." That's all I tell him, and then he's like, "Okay, it's in pubs and they're pub songs." So then he makes me a headdress of corks... ...right? Um, corks all popping... He puts them on little things so it looks like they're popping out of my head. He's an artist. I'm not gonna tell an artist to change their art. - We're good. Thank you. - All right. Whatever he gives me, I wear. We were drinkers, we were such big drinkers. The pub was a community center. There wasn't clean water so we had to drink. We're gonna pass out some beer to the drinkers and ping-pong balls to the non-drinkers. The theater can be so uptight, and there's so many rules, and don't talk, and don't express yourself from the audience, and it's... you're just there to listen and to a-appropriately clap and, you know, appropriately laugh at the right places. And it was just saying, it's okay for you to be chaotic in this space. Now, you're gonna negotiate with your partner which one of you during the next verse is gonna spit their ping-pong ball into the other person's mouth. And, drinkers, just sit back and drink. American Revolutionary War just happened. They've been living under the system of oppression. It's a little bit like a kid in high school's living under the thumb of his parents, strict rules and stuff. Goes to college for the first time and what does he do? He turns America into a frat party. ♪ ...and I'll not ask for wine ♪ ♪ The thirst that from the soul doth rise... ♪ I think a temperance choir just walked into our pub, and they're trying to ruin all our fun. ♪ I sent thee late a rosy wreath... ♪ That decade is so much about my own life in the, in the club world and coming from the theater. When I got out of acting school, I found that I couldn't even get an audition. And I said, "Okay, well, where can I go where they'll just let anyone into the room?" And it turned out it was the clubs in New York City. ♪ Why, fair maid in every feature ♪ ♪ There's such signs of fear express? ♪ ♪ Does this wandering ♪ ♪ Wretched creature ♪ ♪ With such terror ♪ ♪ Fill thy breast? ♪ ♪ Do my brazen looks ♪ ♪ Alarm thee? ♪ ♪ Trust me, sweet ♪ ♪ Thy fears are vain ♪ ♪ Not for kingdoms ♪ ♪ Would I harm thee ♪ ♪ Well, I'm not some Crazy Jane ♪ I started showing up to the clubs, dressed up in my version of drag at the time, and... I'd say, "Can I do a number?" And they'd just, "Sure," you know. ♪ I'm Crazy Jane ♪ I'm singing a song and somebody's giving somebody a blow job right there in the audience. So, I would learn these techniques on how to steal back the... the story. ♪ While each passerby ♪ ♪ In pity ♪ ♪ Cries, "God help thee" ♪ ♪ "Crazy Jane" ♪ ♪ Cries, "God help thee" ♪ ♪ "Crazy Jane" ♪ I cut my teeth in the clubs in New York City. The Cock, the Slide and the Hole, in that order. When you cut your teeth in the clubs and then you try to work in the theater and stuff, ah, ah, it's a long road. I used to only get booked in, um, in theaters when there was a festival going on with a, a caveat in the title. I was at Yale performing one time in a, in a festival there. They called it the "No Boundaries Festival." Which made me really nervous because I have boundaries. One time at The Cock I saw a woman, she pulled a chicken leg out of her vagina. She ate it... ...and she threw it into the audience. Then... she pulled another chicken leg... ...out of her vagina. She ate it and she threw it into the audience. Then... ...she pulled the rest of the chicken... ...I kid you not... ...out of her vagina. She ate it and she threw it into the audience. And I thought two things when I saw that performance. Only two. The first thing I thought was, "She's full." And the second thing I thought was, "She has no boundaries." Whoo! I actually thought three things. The third thing was, "Taylor, you're just putting on eyeliner." Maybe you've noticed this isn't like a regular concert. I call this a performance art concert. What does that mean? At a regular concert, if you don't laugh and enjoy every single moment, cry all in the right places, then the artist has failed you. But in a performance art concert, you can... you can love it or you can hate it. You can be bored out of your mind. You can despise me. You can hate everything I'm asking you to do. You can be annoyed, and I still will have succeeded. It is the genius of performance art, there is no failure. Gold... The gold goes away... just a little bit. This is a beautiful opulence, just for the sake of opulence, for the sake of beauty, for the sake of... effeminism. - And it's a reveal too. - It's a reveal, like when... Because the audience has been blindfolded for an hour, so we want them to concentrate on their other senses for a while. There's multiple reasons, but one is because they've been staring at the stage for four hours. And I thought, let's let them focus on different senses. And I wanted this because the audience is blind, I wanted this to be the most beautiful, most opulent costume that they don't get to see during the show. Yeah. That's what I love about it. My job is to surprise the audience enough that it can push them out of their patterns and, um, out of the current mood that they're in so that they're... they continue to dig in and continue to consider. How can we get everybody to ask questions in the audience about the moment, rather than, "Ah, yes. I understand that moment"? ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Plays on the banjo all night long ♪ ♪ Then she sings her Southern song ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Her bangles and her beads ♪ ♪ They jingle all night ♪ ♪ They never stop ♪ ♪ Till the morning light ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ One more round then heave her dry ♪ ♪ Come on, Jack Tout ♪ ♪ You're not that shy ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ Oh, me Rosie ♪ ♪ Coal black Rose ♪ ♪ ♪ The... Don't applaud that song. Don't applaud it, don't applaud it. That is a sea shanty adaptation of the very first minstrel song. Um... What is happening, and may-maybe you didn't hear the lyric, uh, there's this lyric i-in the song called, ah, it goes, "One more round then heave her dry, come on, Jack Tout, you're not that shy." And what is happening is the men on the boat, they are hoisting up a sail and they're trying to build their community by hoisting up the sail together, with the idea that when they get their job done, they can go into town and gang rape a slave, a woman who is enslaved. People love things that build communities, you know? And they never want to get rid of anything that builds a community. But... sometimes you have to acknowledge that the things that have built the community, um, the foundation for them is evil. And that it's not serving you and that you have to tear it down and start from scratch. You can take off your blindfolds now. And these are the songs that are part of our DNA passed down through us all. We teach children these songs and they sing them. That's the foundation of, of our, our learning. ♪ A-B-C-D ♪ ♪ E-F-G ♪ I'd say, "What is this particular hour of the show going to be about?" and go and hunt for songs that were popular around the time. ♪ Now I know ♪ ♪ My ♪ ♪ ABCs ♪ ♪ Next time won't you sing ♪ ♪ With me? ♪ In the Indian Removal Act, we're singing children's songs. I wanted Taylor's look to have a playful element to it. So it's kind of in the likeness of a, like a nanny, a caretaker of the children, or it could be the mother. I wanted whimsy for the sake of the children, but I wanted something disturbing and sad as a representation of the extermination of the Indians. We tell the story of the Cherokee people who are on the Trail of Tears. Andrew Jackson had this agenda to get rid of all the Native Americans. He wanted genocide. Let's sing a bunch of children's songs on the Trail of Tears in order to distract you from what's going on. He forced the Cherokee to go on this trek from Georgia to Oklahoma.

I'm not really interested in the show being about history as much as I'm interested in it being about all of us in this room have a lot of history on our backs and we're trying to figure out what to do with it. In this decade, we champion Walt Whitman adorned with gay male erotica, flowers and potato chip bags. The reason for the erotica is, Walt Whitman, famous queer writer, also wrote erotica. The reason for the potato chip bags is, apparently potato chips were invented during that decade too. ♪ Weep no more, my ladies ♪ ♪ Weep no more today ♪ ♪ We will sing a song for the old Kentucky home ♪ ♪ For the old Kentucky home ♪ ♪ Far away ♪ ♪ Corn tops ripe on the little cabin floor ♪ ♪ All merry, all happy and bright ♪ ♪ The time has come when the darkies all must part ♪ ♪ The time has come ♪ ♪ When the darkies all must part ♪ ♪ Oh, my old Kentucky home ♪ ♪ Good night ♪ This is the state song of Kentucky, a minstrel song. And they didn't know that until the 1980s, so they changed the word "darkies" to "people." They couldn't get rid of the song. The song was written by Stephen Foster. He is considered the father of American song. And people say, "Oh, you can't be too hard on Stephen Foster, he was a product of his time," but other people were a product of Stephen Foster's time. You know, Sojourner Truth, uh, Frederick Douglass, and one of the great radicals of all time, so radical he's still radical to this very day, Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman said that his poems were songs. So I think Walt Whitman should be the father of American song. So what I thought we would do is to have an epic smackdown. In this corner... ...the sentimentalist minstrel songwriting Stephen Foster. In this corner, the self-proclaimed no-sentimentalist, radical fairy poet Walt Whitman. Who will win the title of father of American song? You decide. All right. You, sir, with the scarf and the popcorn right there? Yeah. Come up here. Come up here. Gorgeous.

And the historians will all tell you "orgy" meant "party" back then, you know? They do, do whatever they can to convince you that no... There was no queerness. You know, they, "Orgy meant party back then." No! It meant orgy. "No, it meant party." Yes, but what happens at a party, right? A drinky-drinky, a smokey-smokey, and pretty soon... Whoo!

And I read somewhere that hotdogs were invented during this time from German immigrants, selling their sausages inside of buns on the street. Is it blood or is it ketchup? You get to decide. Hot dogs. Hot dog! Spins! We like spins! It's drag as metaphor as opposed to drag as impersonation. I'm never trying to look like Marlene Dietrich. It's a metaphor for an idea or a specific time. It's the Civil War, and I'm gonna divide you in half. This side of the audience, you're going to be the Union soldiers. This side of the audience, you are going to be the Confederate soldiers. It's not personal. I don't know you. You're not playing you. You're playing the part I assign you. Now, everybody stand. Everybody, everybody. We're going to have our very first battle.

A-And the reason that I decided to do it is because this song traumatized me as a child, and I thought, "Well, only way to get over that trauma is to own it." This was my dad's favorite song.

I grew up in Stockton, California, which is maybe two and a half hours away from San Francisco. It's in the middle of what used to be great farmland but has been overdeveloped with tract housing, so it's a lot of, uh, kinda cheap, ugly houses one after another after another. It was pretty homophobic. Nobody said anything about gay people unless it was to call us fags. Now the white people in the suburbs, they can stop people of color from being in their community by making it really hard for people of color to get loans. But what they can't do is stop the white queer from being born amongst them. You thought you were safe in the suburbs, and then your child is me. All the young men ages 18 to 30 who are straight are going to come to the stage now because the only way the white queer can hook up with anyone is if he converts. ♪ When marimba rhythm ♪ ♪ Starts to play ♪ ♪ Dance with me ♪ ♪ Make me sway ♪ All the straight guys! ♪ Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore ♪ ♪ Sway me smooth ♪ ♪ Sway me more ♪ ♪ Other dancers may be on the floor, yeah ♪ ♪ Dear, but my eyes, they see only you ♪ ♪ Only you have the magic technique ♪ ♪ When we sway, I go weak ♪ Do exactly what I do. ♪ Other dancers may be on the floor ♪ ♪ Dear, but my eyes, they see only you ♪ ♪ Only you have the magic technique ♪ ♪ When we sway ♪ ♪ I go weak ♪ ♪ I can hear the sound of violins ♪ ♪ Long before it begins ♪ ♪ When we sway you have a way with me ♪ ♪ Stay with me ♪ Do exactly what I'm doing. ♪ Stay with me ♪ Keep doing that, keep doing that, keep doing that, keep doing that.

Steffanie Christi'an and Thornetta Davis! The March on Washington, it was organized by a queer Black man by the name of Bayard Rustin. They did not want you to know he was a queer Black man, because they were thinking, "One thing at a time." Growing up in Stockton, you're feeling like the world is attacking you, and so you have to find your people or, or you'll dissolve, um... or be beaten to a pulp. You know, you have to find, you have to find them.

We read the lyrics and they seemed bad enough. I said, "This lyric is about fag-bashing." And, and I thought, "Well, that's maybe not true." And then I-I heard an interview with Ted Nugent from the '70s where he said, "This song's about fags." He doesn't like anyone who dresses fancy on a stage, and he's gonna set them free. Maybe you could see why I would take offense to that song. When I read that lyric, I said, "We're gonna appropriate that shit." So, so Matt threw down some of his own music and we decided to turn the song into a gay junior prom song. I want you to find somebody who is the same gender as you. If you're gender queer, you can pick anybody. And find someone who's the same gender as you and you're going to slow-dance with them. Come on up, come on up. Everybody, everybody up. Stand up. Stand up, everybody. You're all doing this now. You're all finding somebody of your same gender to dance with. Here, let me... I'll demonstrate on this guy right here. I've noticed, uh, that when straight guys dance, or even gay guys that don't know each other, they can sometimes, you know, um, ch... Or when they hug, they, like, try to put their, their pelvises as far away from each other as possible. Like, I don't want any space between you. I want this kind of... - All right? Okay? - Okay. All right. So that's what I want. So go find somebody. It doesn't have to be two people, it can be three people. It's not a heteronormative narrative. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Snakeskin cowboys ♪ ♪ Who the hell you think you are? ♪ ♪ You're hangin' around ♪ ♪ With your high-heeled sneakers ♪ ♪ Don't think that should get too far ♪ ♪ You're hangin' around ♪ ♪ With your fancy pants on ♪ ♪ Prancin' all around the stage ♪ All right, I let you have a round where you got to laugh and joke and hook up with people and stuff.

I realize that sometimes the nervous laughter and the chatting and stuff is about intimacy with strangers in public spaces and, you know, I get it, but it's also maybe the possibility that there's a little bit of that nervousness is about internalized homophobia or a homophobia, right? So just, uh, just hold the person, just be romantic with them and while Matt plays this piano solo. ♪ ♪ I want to believe that an artist's job is to dream the culture forward.

Taylor's created something that is a radical format for creating community, and I, I think the number-one reason we have problems in America is lack of community. That's my opinion. Um, I think that's why all these people are so angry, because they want to belong to something. What Taylor does is opens the queer community to the world.

I've just watched the network television premiere of Clash of the Titans. That night I go to bed and I have a dream of Maggie Smith riding a Pegasus. And it is my first wet dream. There are also two men having sex in the dream, but I think it was Maggie Smith that did it. I woke up from that dream in, like, mid-orgasm, I was like... And I immediately thought, "Gay people, when they have sex, "they give each other AIDS, and I just had sex, and I'm gay. That means I must have just given myself AIDS." Then all that day at school, the teachers were teaching, teaching, teaching, talking, talking, talking. I couldn't listen to a single thing they were saying 'cause the entire time, I thought, "I'm gonna get AIDS." ♪ I'd like to help you, Doctor ♪ ♪ Yes, I really really would ♪ ♪ But the din in my head ♪ ♪ It's too much and it's no good ♪ ♪ I'm standing in a windy tunnel ♪ ♪ Shouting through the roar ♪ ♪ And I'd like to give the information ♪ ♪ As before ♪ ♪ But blood makes noise ♪ ♪ It's ringing in my ear ♪ ♪ Blood makes ♪ ♪ Noise ♪ ♪ I can't really hear you in the thickening, I fear ♪ ♪ Blood makes noise ♪ So we've reached our AIDS decade, and, uh... I thought we should lose something very special, so this is our last time with Machine, our costume designer. The audience has a bond to that queen. Every time you see one of those outfits, it is just pure delight, so when you think that all of that delight and all that artistry was gonna be taken away, for me, it's... what it was like to come of age during the AIDS epidemic. Uh, every incredible artist that you... hoped would be a mentor, you know, um, passes. It's time to say goodbye to our guitarist, Viva DeConcini. The first time we lose a musician after the first hour, you're like, "But you've only been here an hour." Uh... Hmm. Excuse me. Uh, we lost so many people in our community, um, to HIV and AIDS and the complications, and some folks had only been with us for a very short amount of time. Excuse me. So it's very hard to lose people throughout the work, um, and-and to be reminded of that, um, in our community. Uh, so, yeah, it's deeply significant... because when you're, when you're left, and you've been working with them so hard and then they're gone and you're left and so you're like, "Great, I have to, I have to keep going. I have to keep bringing my artistry and my voice." Uh, I think there's so much poetry in that... but that's also our life. Dating in the '90s was navigating whether or not you wanted to go on a date with someone who might not be here in six months. Never having the moment where your sexuality is free. Yeah. So not... not kinda having the sense of what you may be missing, but you know, always, always being afraid of sex. ♪ Denny picked me up, Denny did me ♪ ♪ He got a tattoo of his dick on his belly ♪ ♪ It was double vision ♪ ♪ Disorienting ♪ ♪ Denny's kind of a dorky fella ♪ ♪ Denny's dramatic ♪ ♪ Denny is dark ♪ ♪ He ain't nothin' like the restaurant ♪ ♪ He's got "HIV positive" tattooed in black ♪ ♪ In six-inch letters on his back ♪ ♪ He says, "I want them to see what they'd done to me" ♪ ♪ Denny ♪ ♪ Denny's reading the Decameron ♪ ♪ About a plague that came before ♪ ♪ 'Cause Denny is dying and Denny don't like it ♪ ♪ And Denny don't dance no more ♪ ♪ He's kinda New Age but Denny's not that smart ♪ ♪ He's trying to love himself but doesn't really know how ♪ ♪ He's got a heart tattoo with his own name in it ♪ ♪ Trouble is Denny doesn't really get it ♪ ♪ Self-esteem is just a dream for Denny ♪ ♪ Denny can be very funny ♪ ♪ He says he wants my asshole tattooed on his chin ♪ ♪ Denny is very demanding ♪ ♪ 'Cause Denny don't got long to live ♪ ♪ Denny did porno ♪ ♪ Photos and film ♪ ♪ Until his tattoos ruined his career ♪ ♪ He stands there watching the video ♪ ♪ Watching himself get infected ♪ ♪ Denny has pneumocystis ♪ ♪ And a new tattoo as well ♪ ♪ Denny got a skull and crossbones ♪ ♪ Smack in the middle of his forehead ♪ ♪ He said, "I want them to see what they'd done to me" ♪ ♪ Denny ♪ ♪ He said, "I want them to see what they'd done to me" ♪ ♪ Denny ♪ ♪ He said, "I want them to see what they'd done to me" ♪ ♪ Denny ♪ The very first time I ever met an "out" homosexual, it was thousands all at the same time. I found out about this thing called an AIDS Walk, and my friend Marcy and I went to the AIDS Walk, uh, in San Francisco, and the first time I ever saw one "out" homosexual, it was thousands of them, and the reason they were all together is 'cause, of course, they were dying, and their loved ones were dying, and they were screaming and laughing and dancing and joyous, while at the same time horrified and full of sorrow, and they, uh, were pushing loved ones in wheelchairs and... uh... what I experienced was a community of people that were being, um, built as a result of being torn apart, and it was a pretty profound experience for a kid. Years later, I thought, many years later, I thought, I wanna make a show that is some kind of metaphorical representation of that. So we started making a 24-decade history of popular music. This decade is all songs that were popular with radical lesbians during the AIDS epidemic. Many gay men, their parents, family members wouldn't take care of them and their lovers were dying at the same time that they were struggling, and so, um... many lesbians really stepped up in a way that was above and beyond. I learned my politics from radical lesbians and I learned how to have confidence from radical lesbians. Lesbians spend so much time having to stretch towards the rest of us. I thought it would be sweet if we invite all of the lesbians in the audience to come up on stage. So, they got to see all of us stretch towards them. ♪ My momma was a waitress ♪ ♪ My daddy a truck driver ♪ ♪ The thing that kept their power from them ♪ ♪ Slowed me down awhile ♪ ♪ I remember the morning ♪ ♪ It was the closing of my youth ♪ ♪ When I said goodbye to no one ♪ ♪ And in that way faced my truth ♪ ♪ And a walk along the river ♪ ♪ And a rain a-coming down ♪ ♪ And a girl ♪ ♪ On a road ♪ ♪ But if music is a boulder ♪ ♪ Let me carry it a long while ♪ ♪ Let it turn into a feather ♪ ♪ Let it brush against my smile ♪ ♪ Let the life be somewhat settled ♪ ♪ With the life that song has made ♪ ♪ Let there be nothing I am longing for ♪ ♪ In some plan I may have made ♪ ♪ In some story quickly written ♪ ♪ In a long forgotten time ♪ ♪ By a girl ♪ ♪ On a road ♪ ♪ Rain upon the water ♪ ♪ Makes footprints sunk in sand ♪ ♪ Anger upon angry hurt ♪ ♪ Take me by the hand ♪ ♪ Take me by the heartstrings ♪ ♪ And pull me deep inside ♪ ♪ And say I'm one with your forgiveness ♪ ♪ And separate from my pride ♪ I had put so much of my life at that point into helping create the show.
