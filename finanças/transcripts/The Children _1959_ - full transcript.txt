The Young Fellows Keep moving, boy, don't daydream. Give the paper, I'm in a hurry. See you tomorrow. - My leg has been killing me lately. - Sorry to hear that. Let's have a drink, don Germán If I was in the Cyclists' Federation... you would see how they would run! Stop talking about cycling. - As if he was going to win The Tour. - That one will never win. Chispas, give me a football pool ticket. Do you want it blank or should I fill it out for you? Blank, please... I'm sure I'd win the pools with you Be quiet, the lady is watching us. - Hide under the awning. -Why are ugly boys like you so shameless? Look at him: he is both handsome and quiet. You're the Sophia Loren of this neighborhood. -That's just what I need! -You don't need anything... -She won't last long around here. -Is she leaving? With her looks, she won't work as a maid for too long. That's nonsense. - Thank you. - Bye. Look, look! -Stand up, Ernesto. -Are you leaving yet? - Dad told you to study all afternoon. - Mind your own business. What have you done? ....If dad finds out...where did you get that from? You are always causing trouble. - Hello...? - Good morning. -The lift always gets stuck on this floor. -How funny... ... someone left the door open again. - Thanks God I always find you here. - It's probably my brothers' fault... - It's fixed. - Thank you. - Hello - What's up? - Do you have any money? - No, I won't have a cent until tomorrow. Tomorrow you have to pay me. I must settle with the old man. - Well... what shall we do tonight? - It's Boxing Night at "Fiesta Alegre" I like boxing, so we'll go and watch it. I'd rather not. I have to get up early tomorrow. Don't be silly. I, too, have to get up at 7. - I want to go to the movies - You always want to go to the movies! - Tonight is boxing night, let's go. - How? It's expensive and we've no money. - But if you pay, we'll go. - Do I look like a fool or what? Besides, he can't go out after dinner Remember last Saturday. I can go out whenever I want, you idiot! Give me the listings. Here is that guy again... We can watch a Sophia Loren movie in "El Callao" What a bore! You always talking about Sophia Loren. What are you doing over there, pigheaded!? I've told you that you can't sell in front of the kiosk. -Boy, he always does the same thing. -Well, at what time shall we meet? -I'll be done by 22.30, if I'm lucky with the old man. - Ok, we'll meet here at 22.30. - But be on time, we won't wait for you! - You are the one who's always late. - A Pecos Bill. Not a good way to start this Saturday. Give that to me! Here. Give me one. - Here they are. - Leave those girls alone! And you, don't screw-up as usual! I don't know. - Don't be silly. - Hello. - Hi, what do you want? - Give me the newspaper. What's the matter with you? I didn't want to come, but the others sent me. Are you coming tomorrow? - But don't stand us up, like last Sunday. - Nice guys like us don't do such things. - Then, shall we all meet? - Yes. - At six, in the same place? - Yes, in the same place. - But don't make us wait. - No, we swear. - Because this time we'll leave. Bye. - Bye. Bye! We've got them in the bag! - Go faster, guys. - Why? I don't want to miss the newsreel. They are passing San Isidro's bullfights. - We'll likely arrive late. - We won't arrive late, don't be a jackass. It's your fault. That happens because we waited for Carlos. Always the same problem. They don't let him go out at night... C'mon, that's enough. What's the matter? Are you in a hurry? Yes, sir. Me too, and I am not pushing others. C'mon guys, give me the dough. 15 pesetas each. Here.... My 15 pesetas. Hey, the movie is only for adults. You don't worry, just follow me. You...how old are you? He is 18. Show me your ID. Are you a cop to ask for ID? I'm doing my job, He is not 18 and the movie is not rated for minors. Then, why did they sell us the tickets? Can't you read? There is a sign at the ticket booth. We read and we work. Why can't we go to the movies? He should be reading comics. Go and ask for your money back. C'mon, let's go. You guys go. I'll tell you the movie later. I'm going in. You will come in if you are 18. Show me your ID. Let's go. Leave this guy. I bet the movie is boring anyway. Go away, boys! Give us our money back. - What a pain. - Hey' don't blame me. They are not letting us in. What do you think of that? - And now, what? - No idea. We can't take you anywhere. You don't even know how to speak. You should have said immediately that you are 18. Mother, I must invite my friends. They have invited me many times. I cannot delay it any longer. The can come on Sunday afternoon if you wish. Not tomorrow. We must arrange things first. I was talking about next Sunday. Please, Carlos, lower the radio's volume. Tune 'La Voz de Madrid', so we can listen to 'The Cavalcade'. This is a setback. We have neither dishes nor cups. I thought we could borrow all that from Aunt Margarita. We would also have to paint the dining room. You should see Amparito's house. Her dad is a dentist, and he makes a lot of money. And Susana....she is picked-up at school every day and goes home in her father's car. - Did you hear that, Enrique? - What? Elena's schoolmates are going to come here on Sunday for an afternoon snack. Why don't leave it for early in the month? I can't, dad! Elena is right. She has been invited many times. Look, we could call Señor Ramón so that he can paint the dining room, then we'll tell him we will pay him early next month. Oh, God! This baby is unbearable. Lady, can I clean the table? - First take this baby away. - Yes, Lady. Come with me, don't cry anymore. - Go and kiss your dad. - You crying baby! Wait... Come here... Take him away. - Did you close the bedroom window? - Yes, Lady. We must educate Juana before Sunday, because she is quite clumsy. Poor girl... We have to buy her a black uniform and a white cap. Why did you stopped 'The Cavalcade'? - You are not listening... - That's what you say! You just want to be a nuisance. You were just talking about your twee friends. You should be studying for your exams! I want to go with my friends, I have studied enough for today. Go and do some studying! - Good night. - Good night. This boy is becoming very uncivilized. He just thinks of his buddies. How come you are still awake? I couldn't sleep, so I'd rather be here. Don't make any noises, your father came home very tired. Turn off the light, son. It's very late. I've been downtown with El Chispa (Sparks) and El Negro (Blackie). We were going to the movies, but in the end we didn't go. I don't like you to arrive so late. - You are going to get cold. - No, I'm fine. It was too hot in the bedroom. Have a glass of milk it's in the meatsafe. I don't feel like it. Do you want me to bring you one? No, thank you. - Did you know that your dad came home very happy? - Why is that? He found another job. - Where? - He will be the bill collector for a medical association. He said it is a good job. We have been making plans. We don't want you to keep working as a bellboy in the hotel. You are too old for that. We must think in a better future for you. I can't stand this any longer. I'm tired of walking and doing nothing. C'mon. We'll miss the bus, and the old man will be calling me tomorrow at 6 AM . Look, it's not 3 AM and I told you she leaves at 3 AM. Come here. What a Saturday night... Give me a cigarette. I don't have any left. He doesn't have any... - Could you give me 5 cigarettes? - Yes, sir. - Could you also give me the empty pack? - Yes, sir. Here it is. - How much is it? - Six pesetas. Do you think I am an American or what? You should see how bad the business is going. - Chispa, lend me 1 peseta. - I don't have one. He doesn't have one peseta... - Nobody is going out at night anymore. - Here, old woman. Let's go, it's getting late. Just wait! - Is that the one? - Yes, you'll see. Hi, Pili. What are you doing here so late? Just walking with a friend. Well, what's going on in the old neighbourhood? - I haven't been there in a long time. - Yeah, you don't want anything to do with us. That's the same old bore. Gentlemen, buy a flower from me. Let me introduce you to El Chispa. My pleasure, I am María del Pilar. A flower for the young lady. - How much? - Anything you want to give me. - Thank you, sir. - It smells really nice. You're a fool. Why did you spend 10 pesetas? She is going to think that we have money. -What else could I do? I couldn't say no. - Bah... In this job you have to wake up early. You came home at dawn, you won't go too far this way. Here is the list with the ones who have to pay you today. See what happens with the ones at number 14. If they don't pay, tell them you won't deliver the newspaper any longer. You heard me? They show off a lot, but they don't pay in time. It's getting worse. My leg is so numb in the morning, one would say is made out of wood. Why don't you have surgery? Surgery... that's what the doctors would like, to cut my leg off. - Where are you from? - From Badajoz. Then go back to your village to water. I told you many times I don't want a wet kiosk. What a pain...from Badajoz...won't he have anything to do over there? - Hello Chispa. Could you give me the ABC? - Hi. Here. I already ordered the magazine you wanted. If I can I'll give you at cost. Don't worry. Since it was taking so long I bought it yesterday in Gran Vía. Thank you anyway. If you want something, let me know an I'll get it for you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Elena, what magazine are you talking about? Here Put those inside. Tell me...what's that story with the magazines about? I am the one who places the orders I haven't died yet. You cannot spend the whole night partying, that's it. Do I always have to be home? What time is it? 12:30 PM. At what time did you arrive last night? I came back late from the cafeteria, and you still weren't home. You know I don't like you to be out at night Let alone coming back so late. Your father has written to us he is sending you some money, and also asks why are you not writing him. Many times I think you are having problems, and that you don't trust me to tell me what's going on. You are all what I have. You are my son, and I don't want any secrets between us. I need you, too. - And how is your health going? - Just great, lady! Since they removed my stomach, I'm doing great. They just left a small piece like this. We must always thank God. Look, that stain over there never went away. That one? It just needs a coat of rabbit-skin glue and it will be gone. What a relief. Lady, the whole area is in terrible condition and needs to be painted. Well, it was painted not long ago. Yes, but today's paint quality is just garbage. Then we have a problem. Lady, could you come with me? I can't comb the children's hair. Good God, aren't they ready yet? Excuse me for a minute. You two, get ready immediately! Where did you put my clothes? - What's the matter? - Hush....Señor Ramón is here. Did you tell him that we won't be paying the rent until the 1st day of the month? - Don't worry, I'll tell him in a moment? - What about Carlos? Is he up? How would I know? The old man told me again this morning. He thinks the regular customers owe us money, but it's you guys. When are you going to pay me? You are going to put me in trouble. Do you think I am the Bank of Spain? Don't be so dramatic, man. I'm worried, because one day the old man will go to collect the money in person. And then, what will I do? Here are my 20 pesetas. OK, I'll delete you from the list. - Your turn, boy. - Hey, you, Carlos! Give me the money. 25 pesetas. Hey, don't keep everything. What will I do this afternoon? Why don't you ask your sister? She must have money, she is the spoiled kid in your family. Leave other people's families alone and give me the money. How much do I owe you? 5 pesetas for the carnation? Of course. She was your friend, not mine, so we must split the cost. I didn't tell you to buy her anything. That's your problem. - So, now it is my fault? - Of course. - Let's go, Chispa! - Just a minute. How can you put up with the old man? He is always in a bad mood. His leg is bothering him, but I prefer it this way. When he is not in pain, he starts talking about the war, and he drives me crazy. Same with my dad. He's got a war medal in the living room and we are not even allowed to look at it. It's best not to pay any attention to them. You are not in my shoes. Chispa, I've been waiting for you the whole morning. And you are here at the busiest time of the day. - Let's go, guys. - What a day... Last Sunday's was a botched football game. So what is he so proud about? - Not even Babá. - Well, I like Babá. There is no one like Di Stefano. What do you want? That's enough, Chispa. I've been waiting for 1 hour. That cannot be, I've been away for just 5 minutes. Your duty is to be here! -Goodbye! - Goodbye. Hey, Negro, that's my seat! Don't be a pain. This shouldn't matter to you. So, what shall we do? What's the plan for this afternoon? We are to meet at 6 at the open-air dance. I must go training. You will have finished by then. Why don't we go alone? It's easy to get a date at the open-air dance. Sure, like last nigh...absolutely nothing! We'd rather stay at home. Then we won't spend any money. Where is this guy coming from? - Hello, Carlos. - What's up? - Do you have Marca? - No, we are out. Why don't you ever save one for me? I am always asking. I can't put one aside! - Bye, Carlos. - Bye, jerk. What an idiot. - Why didn't you save one for him? - Because I don't feel like it! - We are not friends. - That guy is unbearable. - He only greets me because he knows my sister. - Is your sister paying any attention to him? I don't know. Do you want the magpie, you beauty? - What a woman! - She's gorgeous. - Nice body... - Hey, would you mind grabbing Peninsulares (cheaper smokes)? I'm going to run out of Bisonte (a more expensive brand). - Could you please give me the "Ya"? - Yes, madam. Sure. How rude. What a way to keep the newspapers. Don't get mad, madam. It makes you very ugly! She resembles the cannon-woman. So, what will we do until six? We came here to see you bullfighting. So what are you, a bullfighter or a bull? Leave me alone. I came here to practice. It's getting late, and we may not meet any girls this Sunday, either. Then go. I'll come by myself another Sunday. That would be better. To have a good time, it's better if one goes alone to the open-air dance. Are you stupid? To end like yesterday? - Why are you the only ones bullfighting? - Do you own the horns? They belong to everybody. Let me have them! Let him have them, pal! Let's go. Andrés, let me introduce you to Cotufa. He is the one who jumped into Las Ventas bullring last Sunday. - Nice to meet you. - I read about it in the newspapers. It wasn't a good bull, and the peones only let me give one pass to the bull. Did you get arrested? Yes, but the bullfighters paid the fine. He was lucky, they were nice to him. - Did you have any mishaps? -None at all. Let's go, Andrés! It was a very difficult bull. - See you on Wednesday. - Bye, kid. This kid has talent. If a bull doesn't hit him, he could become a good bullfighter. Hey guys, slow down! The girls shouldn't see us running. Otherwise, they will have high hopes. That's their problem. They think we are stupid. Men should have to wait for us. Look at what time they arrive. Look at them, they are not in a hurry. Do you think that's nice? What a cheek! Look at the time, it's 6:45 PM. We should have never put up with that. - Hi... ---Hi. - What's going on with you? Nothing! We are fine! We've been waiting for you the whole afternoon and you arrive when you please. That's not right. Let me go! You are stickier than the flies! - Don't get mad... - I'm going home! We can't spend the whole afternoon this way. We came here to have a good time. Let's go. But I'm warning all of you this is the last time you come late. You knew we would come, so suck it up. Leave it, Negro. Things are already bad enough. I am tired...and I...and I...me too. See that? It looks like my grandma's portrait. Smile, lady, smile. Like if you were riding a horse. -Why don't you take a picture dressed as a bullfighter? - No, that's nonsense. Ride, lady, ride. As if she was Marilyn Monroe. End of act 3. - So, what do we do now? - I don't know... whatever you want. Well, we've come here to have fun If you don't want to do anything we'll go back to the quarter. Why don't we have a few glasses of beer? - Already? - I am also thirsty. No beer, or it will be dark before we know it. Let's go for a walk. Another walk? I've been walking since I was a toddler. If we keep going this way... These guys always to as they please without even asking us. My foot hurts. I won't walk any longer. I'm tired. No wonder with those high heels. Are we going to keep walking the whole afternoon? I'm thirsty. Yes, what a bore. This table is free. Aha! ... It's nice here. Since you are so pigheaded, we'll have some beer. You guys are a real pain... We finally sat. I couldn't resist any longer. My shoes are hurting my feet. Don't get mad. Today it was my fault. - Really? - Yes, I was training. Always the same problem. If it was the first occurrence. This Sunday it's you, last one it was Chispas, and so on. Hey kids, what do you want to drink? 8 glasses of beer. You wait until we have ordered! - I want a Coca Cola!...Me too - Me too. No Coca Colas. Beer for everybody, that's the healthiest choice. Why do I have to drink beer if I don't like it? Hey, what are you looking at? Do you expect me gouge my eyes out? She is with us. Don't flirt, or I'll stand up and punch him in his mouth! Don't scream at me. Can't I even arrange my hair? Leave it, man. Don't be a pain. - I'm thirsty. - Be patient, it will be a while with so many people. I won't miss this chotis. Let's go dance. I don't feel like dancing. C'mon, cheer up and let's go dancing. What a group. Are you mute? You haven't said a word to me in the whole afternoon. If you are getting bored with me, just tell me so. What do you want me to talk about? Well, don't say anything if you don't want to. Careful! I'm not angry. We had to go with Andrés and we ran a bit late. Never mind. Take that moustache off. Everybody is looking. Can't I have some fun? Careful, you keep stepping on my toes. You don't know how to dance? Sure I know how to dance, but my shoes are too big. Yeah, sure. Well, please take that moustache off, or I won't dance with you! -I won't remove them. - Take them off. Damn, one always have to do as women please. Now you look better. What are you doing here? Cheer-up, man. But I'm having a good time. - He is going to kill me with so much dancing. - Have a seat. Boy, I'm doing great. Let's go and dance, princess. - Again with you? - Yes. Oh well. I prefer that you keep telling me about you. Well...bulls are like people; some are good and some are bad. One just needs to know them. Are you not afraid? No. But if I was afraid, it wouldn't matter. I just want to earn some money and give to my family. Do your parents know that? No, they don't. Why don't we take a seat? You are ruining my shoes. - You are the one who is stepping on me. - Why do you always have to argue? Bah...Hey, Carlos, have you seen El Negro? - No... - In the end we'll lose them, you'll see. - Don't you worry. - Sigh... I...am going back with my girlfriends. Who did you come with? Was it with me, or with them? Eh... Behave yourself. You're ugly. Shall we keep going? Come here. - Do you like this? - Yes. Give it back to me, you'll break it! So I fix it and she still complains. She's never happy... Let's go. Wait for us, just two shots left. OK. I saw this coming, we were going to lose them. It's not our fault. We'll find them. What a bore. I am also getting bored with both of you, but I am putting up with it. If someone else I know was here, you wouldn't be so bored. Next time you can invite Carlos' sister. We are not good enough for you. - Hey, careful with what you say! - Of course, since he is sooooo handsome...! No, in the end it will be my fault. - So, when are they going to come? - Carlos! - I'm leaving. - Hey, you, hurry up! Also, these new shoes are killing me... Of course, you should have brought flat shoes. If you want, we can go somewhere else to have a drink. Yes...Manuel, I want to go back home soon. Tomorrow I work at 8. This has been going on the whole week, We can't have a quiet moment together. From tomorrow on I'll leave at 7, and things will be different. Yes, but you have been acting strange during a few days. I've got my reasons. I'm worried about my son. I know, but what can we do? Nothing... Carlos! Carlos! Fernando, why don't you sand this? Don't you see that the samples are there? - How are things going? - We are about done, madam. - Would you like to see the samples? - Yes, of course. Come with me, madam. Look, here are all the colours I brought, so that you can pick the one you prefer. What's wrong with you? Why are you so red? I told you not to close your bedroom's door. You have been daydreaming for a while. We'll see how the exams go. You'll tell me on Monday how it went, I know you well. You and I have to talk later. Carlos, which colour do you prefer? It's better if all of us agree. I don't know, it doesn't matter to me. You never know anything. Where are you going now? I can't study here. I'm going to Rafael's place. To Rafael's place.... My good God! This child...what have you done? Hello, Carlos. Hello. Give me the 'Ya'. Good morning. What are the news? - Let's see.... - No...probably not much. - Bah, nothing...nothing interesting. - She's right...maybe next time. Well, if everybody was like him, we would have a problem. How come you are outside in the heat? I'm going to study to a friend’s place. Mine in unbearable. I'm looking forward to finish the exams. - What are you eating? - Callos (beef tripe). I eat beef tripe almost every day. I like it a lot. My father and I also like them, but they seldom cook them at my place. - Hey, have you seen El Negro? - No... I haven't seen him since he got lost on Sunday. I'm convinced he did it on purpose. I would bet on that. Of course. I noticed immediately that he wanted to leave with her. It's scorching hot. Are you going to play football? If you would know how hot is in there. You may look at the magazines, but don't throw here the sunflower seeds shells. I am the one who has to sweep them. Look, he is playing deaf. What a cheek, he is ignoring you. What a character. Are you going away on holidays this summer? No. My mother and my younger brothers will go a few days to the mountains. Your sister Elena will stay here, huh? Yes, she's happy with her twee friends. They are arranging an afternoon snack this coming Sunday. Your sister is not twee. You don't know her well. She has been picking on me for awhile. Do you want some? No, I don't feel like it. Drink some, it's mostly soda. OK then. Good afternoon. Hi kid, how are you doing? So-so, Maestro. - Are you bullfighting a lot? - Not much. Since I left Manolo... - That was the wrong thing to do. - I know, but now it's too late. - Do you have a cigarette? - Yes, Maestro. Don't you have it with filter? Bring a pack of Virginian cigarettes with filter, quickly. Yes, sir. - The American women, Maestro... - Hide me... - They are leaving... - I don't want them to see me. - What are they doing now? - They are still there. - Here, Maestro... - You, cover him. - Did they see me? - No. - Now is your chance, Maestro. - Now. They follow us everywhere. They don't leave us alone. Those foreign women are just too much. In Seville, in Cádiz, in Málaga, in Barcelona, in Córdoba, in... Is El Negro in there? Yes, go in. So, are we going to the variety show? Can't you go by yourself? It would be better if both of us go. You'll wait outside, I will go into her dressing room and ask her for a pass. I don't feel like going. C'mon, let's go to have some fun. They won't let us in. Yes, they will. She is a friend of mine, we always meet at the lift. Are there more girls? Forget about girls! We are just going to see the variety show, aren't we? Before leaving, you must clean the tool you left behind. I'm already clean, and now this guy must come and spoil it. See what one has to put up with... Hey, don't try to be cocky with me! C'mon, do what I told you to do. Wait for me, I'll be ready in a moment. She's not here. She's probably in her dressing room. No, I'm sure she must come here. Let's drink some beer. Two glasses of beer, please. Have you noticed the two old farts we have behind us? They probably sold a mule and came here to have some fun. Excuse me. Did you notice what she did? - That one? - She wants to flirt. I'm going to see if she is in her dressing room. Bye. What do you want? - Nothing, just waiting.... - Very well, then stay here. I need to go to the hairdresser. My hair is a disaster. We can leave when you are ready. I'm not going. - Do you want a glass of brandy? - No. Then, I'll have one. Give me another drink, please. - C'mon, let's go. - You go if you want to, and leave me alone! Carlos told me he would come... Don't talk while that guy takes away our customers. Go and kick him out of here. Luis, show some humanity. Madrid is a big city. He can go to another street. And if he doesn't go, what shall I do? Hit him? I cannot hit a mentally retarded person. Hey, are you going to leave or what?! Go and kick him out of here. Why is he so obsessed with selling right here? You pigheaded, I've told you to leave! I'm selling here because I want to. - How's your leg doing? - Bad, quite bad. Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor. Whenever my leg hurts I hear the airplanes...Tatatatata! Remember, don Fernando? Those were the times. At least, we were young. Don Fernando saved my life. It was that year, on Christmas Eve. We went through a terrible bombing. Look at them... I knew that would happen. I am doing the dirty work while you are telling your usual old stories. Just be quiet. Paquito, would it be possible that this mentally retarded guy ...? But there is nothing I can do. As far as I know there is no law prohibiting the sale of newspapers. And I end with a dry mouth from talking to both sides. - Leave it, man. - I've had it! Well, don't get mad. Let's go and have a drink. You too, come with us. In this neighbourhood, everyone wants me to solve their problems! All what the old man does is drinking wine with don Fernando. As if he was his son. Let’s hope he'll go soon to the hospital. - Let go of me. - Don't be a nuisance, Negro. Let's go. - Let go of me! - Let's go home, man! - Look who's there. - What’s happening to El Negro? I have no idea. Stop looking and give me a hand! I think he is drunk. No way! They are surely trying to pull our legs. But what's he doing?... Carlos! Look at the way he walks... I'm telling you he's drunk! Yeah, you laugh! I've been dragging him from downtown. He wants to fight with everybody. Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Give that to me! - He is just drunk. - Take him home. - Me, drunk? It takes a lot to make me drunk... - C'mon, let's go! C'mon, take him away! Go away! Calling me drunk.... I should slap him. - Look at what he did! - He's gone crazy! - Hey Negro, what have you done? - Let's pick everything up. - He doesn't know what he is doing. - Don't be an idiot, Negro! - Me, an idiot? - Yes, you! If you can't handle drinking, then why do you drink? - You do what you want... - Bullfighter...you? Calm down! - That's enough, kids! - C'mon, go away! - Aren't we friends? - Friends? Sure... You'll see in what condition he arrives home. Always the same....you say nothing. Why don't you speak? If you have something to say, you better tell me. If things keep going this way, I'll become crazy. I have nothing to say. You are my son but you are behaving like a stranger. Don't you understand I need you? And now you arrive drunk! Why did you do it? Answer me, why did you do it? You already know why I did it. Every day you are delivering the newspaper later and later, Chispa. What do you want me to do? I am by myself in the kiosk. I don't care, I just know that the newspaper arrives late, and I pay for it. Same here. I pay and I want meat, not fat. Please remove that chunk. If you don't want it, then leave it. I serve everybody equally. - Do you have my order ready? - Here are the chops. Watch for bones. The only bone around her is you. Put it on the account. What a cheek, those maids don't show any respect. I've never seen anything like this before. For the last while, maids don't last at my place more than 8 days. Each of them has a different problem. I'm very happy with mine. She came recommended by the Little Sisters of the Poor. She is a girl who works a lot and eats little. How lucky you are. - Bye. - Bye. Who is attending here? In a moment, madam. In a moment. I'm getting bored. Can I go home? No, you'll stay here! That will teach you not to come home late. I thought I had enough money, but I am 2 pesetas short. - Don't worry, you can pay me tomorrow. - Thanks a lot. I'm leaving. There is nothing I can do here. Who is giving the orders here? How much do I owe you? Fifty pesetas, madam. Don't worry, it's not so serious. I'm devastated. My father said that if I don't pass this year he will make work as a bricklayer. Well, I already see you with a trowel in your hand. My father doesn't joke. - That's unfair, I think he's against me. - Well, I'm sure he will fail me. For sure. Omnia Gallia est divisa in partes tres. Good morning, Don Aurelio. What did he say? You will fail for sure. Whatever. I won't study anymore. There is no use. Hello Antoñita. How are you? I'm not sure, but I think I messed the second exercise. Your father is waiting for you. - Oh, hi, dad. - How did the exams go? -Fine... - I'm glad, let's go. Carlos... - Hi. - Hi...but what are you two doing here? How come you haven't called me since Sunday? Calling you...don't you see I must study? Carlos, have you seen Andrés? Sure, I saw him yesterday. But why are you asking me? You want me to join? No, the are girls from my neighbourhood. Let's run to the bus. Hi, Coalza. How are you? Good. I'm trying to get a novillada (fighting younger bulls) arranged by Sunday. We'll see what we can do. But kid, keep in mind that they are 5-year old bulls. Hey, careful, watch where you go! - Good afternoon. - Oh, hi. - How are you? - Fine, and you? Maestro, he is Andrés, the bellboy. Good afternoon. - Did they give you the tickets? - Yes, thank you very much. You are welcome, it was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy the bullfight. Very well. Good luck, Maestro. Hi. Has the show been cancelled? No, the company is leaving. It's a miracle they managed to stay in business until 2 days ago. Nobody was coming, and the owner won't listen and he is not installing air conditioning. Nobody listens to us old men. Nobody pays attention to what we say. These kids know nothing about football. I already told you that Helenio is the best. Helenio is nothing but a big mouth. You will see what happens next year with the Barcelona. It burns all his players in one season. Next year the Barcelona will be League Champion, Cup Champion, will win the European Cup, and will also win all the Fair Cups. Stone the crows! - Greasing, please. - Sure. Bye. - Beautiful girl. - OK. She's beautiful, isn't she? You should be happy today, you'll make good money from tips. This guy is nuts. On Sunday I will jump into the bullring. Don't be foolish. Why will you jump into the bullring? I'm serious. I'll jump. Do you want to go to jail? Eventually one gets out of jail. I cannot remain this way forever. Do you buy old newspapers? - We don't buy, we sell. - Thank you. - Look at this guy... - Many have started by jumping into the bullring. We'll talk about that. Do you know who buys old newspapers? - In the fish market over there. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Well, with regards to you jumping into the bullring, we will all make that decision. - It has already been decided. - We'll see. - We'll see. - That's what you think! - Hi Chispa. - Hi. - Will you give me Caretas? - It has just arrived. I'm going to get a French magazine that nobody has in Madrid. If I don't see you, I'll give it to your brother. Is it very expensive? Don't worry about the money. You will pay me when you can. Thanks a lot, Chispa. You are welcome. - See you. - Bye. You are in love! Don't be a fool....me in love? There is El Negro. He doesn't want to come closer. Why don' you make peace both of you? I'm not angry at him. I don't understand. El Negro is a friend. - Give me two Bisontes (cigarettes). - Yes, sir. Here. The last few days.... Are you serious about jumping into the bullring? Of course I'm serious. I think that's a foolish act. Watch out, Chispa. Don't say anything in front of the old man. Don't worry, tomorrow he's going to the hospital. Another couple going in. Same as every day. That hall is as busy as a subway station. What a great business having a boarding house like that one. I agree. Well, what about Sunday's bullfight? - There is no bullfight. - What do you mean by no bullfight? I've been waiting for an hour. I should be back home by now. Otherwise I will be in trouble. You came because you wanted to. I came because we had a date. Don't you remember? If we had a date, then wait until I feel like coming. Otherwise, just leave. What's wrong with you? Let's go home, it's too late. There is nothing wrong with me, understand? We'll go home when I feel like it. Why do I always have to do as you please? We are not engaged yet. Bah. You have been acting strange lately. Are you angry at me? Leave me alone. Let's go. Don't play hard to get, you are all the same. Forgive me. My personal problems are not your fault. Chispa.....Chispa. The time has arrived. Here are all the kiosk's legal documents. I'm telling you just in case something happens before I return. It's all here. There is also a letter I wrote a few days ago. If something happens to me, the kiosk will be yours. It's all in order. What could possibly happen to you? That's nonsense, it is a simple surgery. I know, I'm just talking. But it's always wise to keep things in order. One won't become rich with the kiosk but... if you work it you'll make enough to earn your living. Who are these? Don't you recognize us? It's don Fernando and I. We took this picture in Montes Universales, near Teruel. Next day we attacked a position called El Cuervo (The Crow). Don Fernando saved my life. Hadn't been for him, I would have frozen to death in the snow. Let's go, Chispa. Don Fernando is waiting for us. I think I should go with you to the hospital. What for? Go to the kiosk, see how you handle the business until my return. Could I have a porra, please? Thank you. Hi, good morning. Good morning, don Fernando. Eat a porrita, they are hot. No, I can't eat anything because the told me in the hospital that I have to fast. That's nonsense. A porra cannot hurt you. I cannot eat anything prior to the blood test. Eat one, Chispa. I'm buying. Thank you, I'm not hungry. Eat it, don't refuse don Fernando's invitation. Well, let's see how well you manage. At night make sure you have locked the door well. You know that the key fails many times. Don't worry, you can leave things to me. I'll visit you tomorrow. No, I don't want you to come until I tell you. Don Fernando will let you know when. - Did you make the arrangements? - Yes, here are the pajamas. I think it will fit you well, I ordered my size. - So the old man finally made a decision. - Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Hey, this one didn't pay me for the porras. Let's go, Chispa. Let's go, man. - Goodbye, Chispa. Let's take a cab. - Let's go. I'll go with you to the taxi station. You stay here, the newspapers will arrive at any time. As you wish. Poor Chispa. Aunt Margarita's set of dishes is very nice. I agree. We must be very careful not to break any cups. I'm not sure the walls will be dry by tomorrow. We just have to follow señor Ramón's advice. Keep the windows open all day. Help me. Start cleaning that. Yes, mom. I will help you. Juana....how elegant! Amazing! Juana... Come here. How did you put your white cap on? Turn around. This is the right way. Walk a bit so that we can see you. Let's see... Turn around, raise your arm. No, the other one! Turn around again. Now from the side....come here. Fantastic... black uniforms are great. Tomorrow I'll buy you a pair of white gloves for when you serve the food at the table. I don't want any gloves, Miss. But why not? Because I don't know how to do anything with gloves. Great... Well, now take your uniform off and put it aside until tomorrow. - Yes, Lady. - You'll see it's not as difficult as you think. I won't be able to do it with gloves! Relax and don't be a nuisance. Look, I was thinking to make for tomorrow a few lemon buns. With 2 kg of sugar and 1 liter of milk we can make so many that they could eat as many as they want. What's going on with Carlos? He passed by my side without saying a word it seemed like he was daydreaming. Enrique, I think we should call the doctor. You probably have noticed he has lost a lot of weight. I know what's going on with him. We'll see on Monday. Mom, we'll also have to bring ham-stuffed rolls. That doesn't matter. But be careful with the cups, don't break any. Remember that Aunt Margarita is very fond of them. Could you give me 'Pueblo", please? - Bye. - Bye. Here, Chispa. Don't let anyone see it. Nobody but you knows what I am up to. Why don't you want? What you are trying to do is stupid. Don't say anything. I said I'll jump, and I will do so. Andrés, why don't you leave it for another Sunday? Yes, leave it. No, I don't want to wait any longer. One of this Sunday's bullfighters knows me he always stays in the hotel, and he will bail me from jail. We need to buy the tickets. We won't let you go alone. I can lend you some money now that he old man is not here. I've got exams on Monday, so I'll have to stay home on Sunday. You studied during the whole week and you also want to stay home on Sunday. Don't worry, you'll find out what went on. - No way, we all must go together! - That's it, we all must go. - Hi guys. - Hi. Andrés, I think that what you are going to do is insane. You promised me not to tell anyone. Look at him. El Negro is one of ours, isn't he? Of course. That's enough, be friends again. C'mon, have a seat. Where will we get tickets for all of us? Do you want one, Negro? Hey, did you think I wouldn't go? You've become more stupid since last time I saw you. Don't start again, we've been doing fine during the last few days without you. Morning, gentlemen. Are there some smokes for the artists? - You, give them some cigarettes. - May God bless you. Hey, give me a comic. - Here.... - Thanks a lot. Hey, get out of here! You think we are giving free candy? Always with the same story... Go away! Don't you see you are obstructing the way to the kiosk? Those guys are a real annoyance. - They are like flies. - Here are the girls. Same as last Saturday. And they won't leave. They want to be with us on Sunday. - I'm leaving before they come here. - They won't get me. If you are going home, then give this magazine to your sister. And tell her not to worry about the money. She can pay me when she has a chance. - See you. - Bye. Andrés, I think this is too small. I don't think so. The real ones are bigger, but not much bigger. We can hide this one better in the bullring. What do you want, kid? Do you have mint candies? We don't sell candies, kid; just newspapers. - Go away. - Hey, leave the kids alone. Andrés, I would like to tell you something but don't you laugh, eh? I've had this medal for a long time, and it always brings me luck. If you want it, you can use it tomorrow. Thank you, Chispa. Relax, everything will be fine. How are we going to relax, when we know what you are up to for tomorrow? - What do you want? - I want to see the Señorita. What for? Is someone sending you? I live in the flat below. I know her and wanted to ask her for something? - Who shall I announce? - I am Carlos. Wait here, I'll see if she is available. Come in. Come in...wait here. Ah, it's you. They told me 'Carlos', but I didn't know 'Carlos' was you. Yeah, my name is Carlos. Yes, of course. Look, as a matter of fact I don't know any of the neighbours Your case is different, for I always meet you at the lift. Come with me to the balcony. Sorry for bothering you, but I would like to ask your for a favor on behalf of a friend. He's been bugging me for 15 days. I didn't want to bother you. You are never bothering me. Come. Marcos, I would like to introduce you to a young neighbour. He is the one who always rescues me from the lift. Have a seat. Carlos, let me introduce you to my fiancé. Great, man. Put yourself comfortable. So, what do you do? Are you studying or working? I study. Do you want to drink something? No, I don't want to drink anything. I have to study in a moment. Hey, what did your friend want? It's not a friend, it's my sister. She wants a signed picture of yours. You should have told me earlier. I'll be pleased to give you one. So, kid, what about girls, eh? Do you have a girlfriend? No, just a friend. Here, pick the one you like the most. This one. Well, I don't think this one is the most appropriate for your sister. But if it was for you... I'll bring one I think she will like. This one. What do you want me to write on it? I don't know. - What's her name? - Elena. "To my little friend Elena... with fondness" So, kid, what do you have to say? Nothing... "Elena...you don't know who I am... but I see you walking in the street every day.... You are the most beautiful girl in the neighbourhood... I am in love with you...." Let go of me, please, don't hold me! Let go of me! What happened to you, son? Were you dreaming? You were screaming! You did scare us! I had to slap you, as you wouldn't wake up. Mother of God, I'll tell Juana to make you a cup of tea. I don't want any tea, I'm OK. Stay in bed for awhile and rest. - What time is it? - It's 9:30 AM. Go and sleep a bit more. - Yes, son, sleep a bit more. - What a child. - My God, did he ever scare us! - It will go away, son. What's going on with this kid? In the first floor is 'Ya', in the second is 'ABC', in the third.. - Could you give me 'Ya'? - Yes..., give it to him. And tell him to pay you what he owes, that I am sending you. C'mon, go. Very well, boss. The weather has been great during the whole week, and now it has to rain... I'm glad it rains. That's good for you. I don't know why. If they cancel today's bullfight, then I'll jump next Sunday. - Will they refund us the money? - Hey, what time is it? - It's 12:30 PM. - Well, I'm leaving. - Where are you going so fast? - I've got things to do. Bye. Bye. - What shall we do this afternoon? - It's still early, it may stop raining. Today it will be raining during the whole day. - Who knows? - You'll see. Give me the ' Dígame'. I'll stay here. - And what will you do? - We're leaving. - Aahh, you will let us know, eh? You were keeping it to yourself... - OK, let's go. - Yes, let's go. Bye. Poor guy, he is soaked. You are soaked, have you been waiting for a long time? - No, just a moment. - Joaquín...! Joaquín! Goodbye, Carlos. Hello, Carlos. What's going on? - Why? - Just look at your face. How unfortunate. I'm sure they will cancel this afternoon's bullfight. What a Sunday is awaiting us! This looks like a funeral. What are you looking at? - Speak! - I think that El Negro's mother is crying. Why would she cry? So, have you made any arrangements with him? We can't count anymore with el Negro on Sundays. He is in love. Look at that guy. If he comes any closer, I will punch him in the face. Why? Because he wrote a letter to my sister. He says he is in love with her. Hey, you, go and collect the money from number 22. He says he is in love with her, that he sees her walking on the street every day... -...and some more nonsense. - Maybe it wasn't him, eh? Of course it was him! Such a stupid letter could only come from an idiot! Besides, even if there is no signature on it, my sister has been suspecting it for awhile. - If I get my hand on him... - If it just would stop raining. What a misfortune. C'mon, stop thinking about the bullfight! What shall we do this afternoon? You, what shall we do this afternoon? Subtitles by O Cangaceiro
