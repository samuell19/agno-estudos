This movie is inspired by the life story of Esra Inal. The characters shown in the movie are fictional. The Earth needs a full orbit around the sun for one year. For this journey, it takes 365 days. We already know that. Someone I loved once told me that in order for the sun to complete one year it needs to orbit around the Milky Way. This orbit takes 250 million years. Incredible, isn't it? If we were to measure our lives in galactic years, a human life would only last eight seconds. Born for eight seconds. From the sun's point of view, we would be millions of shining lights, that flicker on and off for eight seconds. As brief as a breath. Perhaps that's why life is such a wonder. Becoming a part of it, is not that easy. It really isn't possible, Mikail. Raising a child at that age? We have grown-up daughters. - Stop it. - They can help us with it. Maybe you're right. What's going on? What are you three doing here? - We want a sibling. - What? - We'll take care of it. - Yes! You won't say "I'm busy" or anything then. - Homework... - No! Promise. You won't leave me alone with this. - Promise me? - We promise! Come here! This is how my story begins. I'm coming. Oh, my little lamb. Come here, my little Esra. Oh. Oh. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. What do we have here, such a sweet little girl? So there is someone in the world who can calm down my angel. - Move away! - Esra! - You're talking to God, aren't you, Daddy? - Leave your father alone, please. Can you ask the God if He loves me? Esra, leave your Dad alone. I want to speak with the God too! You'll speak with Him later. Come have your breakfeast first. Well then. My pretty girl wants to speak with God? - Then speak. - How, if I can't see Him? We have such tiny little eyes, God wouldn't even fit inside them. Sometimes we feel like we like someone without saying anything. And just like that, we can also feel God. So you can talk to God. Anytime and as much as you want. But what if God doesn't speak my language? Let me tell you something. Not only can God understand our language. He can also read your heart. Helen, can you start, please? The fox called the owl: "Owl, come. Let's play ball." Very nice, thank you, Helen. Your turn, Esra. Esra? - The fox said, "Fox, fox, fox." - Esra? The red ball is rolling, rolling, rolling. Esra! Please sit down. - The fox said, "Run, run!" - Esra! Sit down and calm down right now. This is not a nice behavior, Esra. I'm sorry, but I have to give you a "sad face" for today. I think your behavior is not very nice either. I also have to give you a sad face. It's raining! Helen, come! Stay here, Esra! You're soaking wet. No! It's our fault. We forgot to tell you. Esra is very afraid of umbrellas. She's afraid of umbrellas? Because of our climate shouldn't we gradually get her used to umbrellas? - Yes, of course. - Esra is a very difficult girl. May I ask why her parents didn't come? They're both working. Then let's inform them when we they back they're going to receive a letter from the school. Maybe an integration school would be a better solution for Esra. Esra? Esra. Esra, honey, easy. Come on over, my little angel. Tell me, what happened? I don't want to go to another school. When I read, I just love to sing along. I really didn't mean to do anything wrong. Of course not, my little darling. I know that. Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very special man. This man prayed like no one had ever prayed before. To feel closer to God, he would spin around for hours on end, and I mean really for hours on end, in circles. As he spun, he would hold one arm up and one down, so as to spread all the love he received from heaven on Earth. To distribute on earth. Once he even spun for 36 hours straight without a break. Everyone who saw him said he was crazy. But when he opened his eyes, he was no longer the same. The spinning had transformed him into something special. People saw the deep peace in his enlightened face. And because they had thought him crazy, they were now ashamed. What I'm trying to say is: It's not bad to be different. Your father told me that you are a very special child. - What is special about you? - I don't know. - Can you fly, for example? - No, I can't. Neither can I. But I can imagine it. Can you do that too? Then close your eyes. You start to lift off the ground. You ascend. You see the roofs of houses from above. You rise higher and come to the moon. To the one who gives you answers. You ascend to the sun, to the Milky Way. And somewhere there, when our world is no longer visible, we are nothing more than an illusion. An illusion. Just a conjecture. Now open your eyes. Did you understand what I was trying to tell you? No. Eventually, you will understand. - And if you imagine that you understand it? - I can do that. That's good, my child. You are the dream image of a beautiful girl. In the Creator's beauty sleep. Don't be afraid. I won't allow anyone to scare you. And please, never stop dreaming. And now go. You can turn as much as you want. Esra. Time to go to bed. Wow, they were spinning so much. You should have seen it. Yes, my darling, I believe you that it was beautiful. But now it's bedtime. And we don't do that in school, okay? It can't always be the way you want it, my dear. From now on, we'll adapt a little more. Good night. And where are you going? I'll be right there. Sleep already. Why are you looking like that? Last night, I had to sleep alone. Where were you, Hayat? I was in the living room, then we slept together. Stop lying. I saw you in your white dress. Then you ran to a man and kissed him on the mouth. And the man just took you away. That bodes well. But that was just a dream. And dreams aren't real. No, that was real. Come on, Esra. Eat something. You have to go to school. That was my first lesson about dreams. They weren't real. Soon after, my oldest sister Hayat's dream came true. Then Aylin's dream, and then Sevgi's dream. But for me, it wasn't real either. Suddenly, it starts to rain. Mom? Why don't my sisters live here anymore? You know why. They got married and have their own apartments. People are born, grow up, and get married. You will too. - No, I won't get married. - Mom? - What's up? - One more, I'll get the rest later. - Okay. - Why is he taking all our stuff away? This apartment is too big for us, understand? And dad is now looking for a smaller one. Do you still remember that big wall? It doesn't exist anymore. That's why it's difficult to find an apartment. And until we find a new one and move in, you'll stay with your sister Hayat. OK? If you want to, you can sit in the front. - No, I'm not coming. - I caught a little bird! Egg! Now we're flying away. - I don't want to go! - Bye. Oh, Esra! Esra, my darling. Don't look so sad now. You have such a beautiful room here, with your pictures. The two of us, Uncle Sami and I, love you very much. Don't make us sad. Good night. Dear God. I know you can hear me. I'd like to ask you for something. Can you please protect Mom and Dad? They should never have to be alone. And then everything will be a million times more beautiful than I ever dreamed it would be. I love you. Please love me too. Amen. Sister, sister! What's wrong, Esra? I had a bad dream. I'm so scared. - Can I please sleep here with you? - No. Go to your room. Okay. You go first and I'll follow, alright? You're not going anywhere. It's the same drama every night. She needs to learn to sleep alone. Go to bed! Years went by. Not only did I grow, but so did my dreams. Whether my dreams were visions or reflected my fears, I didn't know. I needed more time to answer this question. But I had other problems. - Where are you going so early? - To mom's. And why so early? If I'm late, you get upset. If I'm too early, same thing. - What now? - Come straight here after school. What kind of skirt is that? - What about it? - It couldn't be any shorter? You're right, I overdid it a bit. Next time, I won't wear anything at all. I'm warning you! Mom? Mom? Mom? No! Mom! Mom, wake up! Help! Help! What's wrong with you? Help! Help! I dreamt it exactly like this! - Are they on their way? - I don't know! - How is my dad? - How is dad? - Listen to me. - Please be quiet. - Sevgi, you wait there. - Can I tell you something? - I saw my mother in a dream. - Esra! Sit down! How is your mother? - Hmm? - Your mother! - She will get better. - That's good. Then why are you crying? - Because no one wants to listen to me. - I'll listen to you. What did you want to tell me in the taxi? I didn't understand. I dreamed about my mother. She was unconscious in the living room. And this morning I found her exactly like that. The dream saved her. But no one in my family will listen to me. Were you waiting for us? No, I'm on my lunch break. Do you want half a muffin? - What's your name? - Esra. - And you? - Tayfun. Why don't you ever talk about your dreams? - I don't dream. - Nonsense. You just don't remember. Even if I did, what good do dreams do for me? Then I don't need to tell you what I dreamed about us. - What was it about us? - We were a couple. I'm going out again. - Where to? - I'm meeting Helen. Wait a moment, I'll drive you. You don't have to. I like walking. Okay? See you later. Esra, come here. Come. Oh my God. My brother-in-law! Come with me. Quickly! Let's go! That was close. Why do you look around when you're kissing? Because of my brother-in-law. My brother-in-law! Esra? Come here. Bye. Esra? Yeah, what's up? Where do you come from? - At one in the morning? - I wish you a good night too. What are you doing? What are you doing? - I want to know where you were. - I told you, I went to Helen's. - And were you there? - Of course. And why doesn't Helen know about it? I'm asking you for the last time: Where were you? I was at my boyfriend's. How shameless! You even say it. - You wanted to know it so badly! - How disrespectful. And what you're doing right now is respectful? To hit someone? Who do you think you are? - Who? - I'm responsible for you. You are entrusted to me. - Get up! - Leave me alone! Have you gone crazy? - Go to your room now, Esra. - I'm not going anywhere! Leave me alone! - What the hell are you doing? - You're making me angry! I'm not afraid of you! - Are you crazy? - I will never forgive you for this! - From now on, you will follow the rules! - I will not! - I will not! - Esra! I don't need anyone to educate me and tell me what to do! Especially not you! This is my life! - This is my life! My life! - Let go! Go away! Go away! Take her with you! This is my life! Stop talking nonsense! Now listen to me very carefully, okay? This is my life. And you're not going to interfere with it! - You better not interfere! - Esra. - Don't you interfere! - Go to your room. - No one interferes in my life! - Okay. Okay! None of you! My life! Can a person live where they're not allowed to be themselves? Can you tell a cat to be a bird, or forbid a bird to fly? A cat will always be a cat, and a bird will always fly. Just like humans always strive for freedom, no matter the cost, because it's in their nature. Didn't you say people eventually get married? You're still so young. When did you get married? That was different back then, and it's different now. Get your degree, find a job, then you can do what you want. I'm getting my degree soon anyway. You've made your decision. Mrs. Havva, we'll discuss the actual topic shortly. Please. So, our children have met and fallen in love. They say they can manage both studying and marriage at the same time. If your son also has the talent for ironing, cooking, and so on, - then it will work out. - No. - Melek, does that have to be said? - Just a moment, honey. It's just that my daughter just noticed that this apartment has a kitchen when she made the coffee. But if two people love each other like they do, it's certainly not a problem. Right? In any case, I can promise you, you won't be bored with her. Every night there are new dreams with lots of travel and adventures. But you'll get used to it, Mrs. Havva. We did too. - Is my makeup okay? - Yes, you look beautiful. Gorgeous. You forgot the pins. Mom, we're not taking any money. We've already discussed this. - Isn't that right, Tayfun? - We're discussing something right now. But it's tradition. Some have money, some don't. We don't want to embarrass anyone. What's that? Stop that. - I'll tie the red ribbon on you. - No. Who are you? God, your memory is fantastic. I'm Tayfun's aunt, is that so hard? - Come on. - No, auntie, I decline. I'll stay like this. The ribbon symbolizes honor for the woman. People would consider you as unvirgin. - What do you think I am? Spoiled goods? - Tayfun? - That's impertinent. - Oh, and lying to people with the fabric isn't impertinent right? Tayfun? - Esra! - Ah, the voice is back. Congratulations, your son can speak after all. - Let's go. It's time. - Wait a minute. Let them go. - What's going on? - Everything's fine. Let's go. Esra? Are you having fun, my dear? Esra. The distance from here to the door is 20 meters. So you have enough time to make a decision. And if you want, we can walk the path together. It was a great celebration, wasn't it? Everything turned out just the way we wanted. We got married. We have a home. We will have children. You don't have to worry anymore. From now on, I am responsible for you. Esra! Esra! Esra! I'm here! Esra! Esra! I'm here! Esra! - Esra? - What happened? I dreamed that a man separated us. - What? - He separated us with his hand. We dreamed the same thing. What? We were under the ground, and he separated us. - We dreamed exactly the same thing! - This is not just a dream. Something like this can drive someone crazy. - Come on, let's go. - What? Wait! - Esteemed guests. - Esra. What? These demons are sent by the devil with a preference for newlyweds. To disturb their domestic peace right from the start. And since the female gender is naturally weaker than the male, the women are the first to be possessed. See, that's exactly what I mean. But, thank God, it's possible to cure them of this affliction. - Is he coming to me now? - Just be quiet. - Shh! And why? Do you think this is normal? - Demons, leave this child alone! - Can you say something, please? I say, leave this child alone. You're unbelievable. Answer me. How many are you? - Actually, you should be sitting here. - How many? Well, four! One, two, three, four. Got it? Where are you going, Tayfun? To work. I'm working nights now. - What? Since when? - Since today. And what about me? What should be with you? You just sleep. No, I'm coming along. - No, you're not coming along. - Yes, I am. Hello. Oh, shit, there's another customer. Man, Esra. As long as you're here, I won't get any rides. Understand that. - And that's my fault? - Listen, my love. I understand that you don't want to be alone. Then I'll drive you to my mother's. Stay with her. - What do you think of that? - You don't have to. Stop it. I'll find a solution. Not necessary, I'm not coming with you anymore. Don't worry. I'll find a night job too. No, you're not working. Make sure the logo on the beer is always facing the customer, that's important. Okay. You'll always be smiling. Also, the customer is always right. Always. Even if they're wrong, don't argue with them. I don't want any trouble, okay? Esra? The customer is always right. Damn it! Are you new here? Let me give you a tip. Don't get on my nerves, and stay away from my tables! Esra, please focus. I told Michael you were experienced. - Yes! Yes! I got weekend shift! - Yeah, you're so fast! So it seems that when you serve the boss directly, things get done quickly, right? Move out of the way, let me pass. - What are you saying? - Get lost. I'm back! Tayfun? Hey, honey? Look. I did a little shopping. Here. Nice, isn't it? I got something for you too. This is for you and this is for me. Mmh! What's wrong? I have a gift too. Where is it? In my jacket pocket. - What is it? - These are electricity bills. You have so much money now. Why don't you pay them? Cheers. Cheers. Did you see her face? Did you see the girl's face? Unbelievable. It was amazing. Darling, come and sit with us. No, I don't want to disturb you. Come and sit with us. (Singing together in Turkish.) I'll be right back. Can you please drive slower? Tayfun! Do you want to kill us? Please drive slower! - Is it so bad to have fun? - No, go ahead and enjoy yourself. - You're jealous. - You want to become a singer? Then fuck off, and become a singer! - Let them say that Tayfun's wife is a whore. - Look at the road! You don't care. I'm the idiot! I have to take care of everything. Don't blame others! Who would say "Esra is a whore"? And as if I care about that. - What's wrong with you? - Don't yell! You don't know anything about me, huh? - Exactly, I don't know anything anymore. - What? I don't give a damn about you! Watch it. Talk to me properly. Are you serious? Are you crazy? You are the crazy one here. Don't make hand gestures. Nobody hits me! Nobody hits me! And you? You're not going to hit me! You can't do that! Are you happy now? That's what you wanted, right? - Are you finally satisfied, huh? - Leave me alone! - Get back in the car! Esra! - Damn it! Move your car. Move your car! Are you crazy or what? Quick, move your car. Move your car. Look what happened because of you! Come on! Get out of here! 20 Missed Calls - Tayfun What did you do here? What did you do to my things? Hm, what's this? You cut them up? You're a monster. I went too far. I'm sorry. I'll make it right. Let's make an agreement. From now on, I'll give you all the freedom. If you want to work, then work. If you want to sing, then sing. Wear what you want. All I want is one thing: When I say stop, you stop. What? Who do you think you are? - Am I your slave or your dog? - Stop yelling. You're giving me my freedom? How nice! - Let me go! - I want to tell you something. Stop screaming. My mother is here. - That's outrageous. - Let go! I went against my parents because of you. What are you talking about? Your mother is here? Don't kiss me! - I'm leaving. - You're not leaving. You're not going anywhere. Stay out of this. - Wait! - You need to calm down. - Sit down! - No. - You're not going anywhere. - I'll go where I want. - Esra. Sit down. - I'll go where I want. In front of all these people. That's outrageous! Isn't that outrageous too? Did you see that? And did you see the apartment? Isn't that outrageous? That's not a reason to destroy your family! Do you think we were a family? Am I to blame again, or what? - I'm to blame, right? - Come on, get out of here! I'll go! - But then I'll kill you! - You can't kill me! Come on then, come here! Here's your damn ring! - Let me go! - Don't do that! Then I'll kill you! Let go of me! Esra! I think there are two situations in which people become aware of their existence: When they fall in love, and when they face death. All right. Then the divorce is now legally valid. Do you think it was a mistake? Jumping out of the window? Do you know how many women there are who can't do what you did? Even though they're unhappy. Simply because they're afraid of being alone or of what others might say. You're the bravest woman I know. I'm just not that brave, sis. I'm actually terrified. Courage doesn't mean not being afraid. It means doing something despite the fear. And that's what I'm learning from you. Your apartment is really cute, Esra. Congratulations. - Thank you, darling. - Yes, it's quite big. - Esra, do you have... - Don't carry such a heavy load. Luckily, the apartment is on the ground floor. So you can't confuse the window with the door. Let's leave the past behind. You have it so nice here. What's still in your way? Thank you. Well, I'm in the way. Come here, my little sweet girl. I won't let you go. Your life belongs only to you. No one is allowed to interfere. But there's one thing you have to promise me. No matter what happens to you, and a lot can happen, never, ever lose the ground under your feet. Promise? You can count on me, Mom. I promise. I'm fine. Oh God, please save me from here. And that went on for months. A life on the threshold between dream and reality. I had no idea what was happening to me. I didn't want to be alone anymore. Great makeup, darling. - Is everything okay? You're so nervous. - I haven't slept in weeks. - Then please go to the doctor, okay? - Right. Why didn't I think of that? "Mrs. Inal, how are you feeling?" "I'm chasing a stranger in my dreams." "Objects pulsate as if they're alive." Should I do it like this or what? - I didn't mean it that way. - None of you mean it that way, Helen. You've taken over my tables again. Are you stupid? What's your problem? My problem is you. I have to look after your tables because you can't keep up. We'll talk later. Let's talk now, come on! Let's sort it out now! Go away now. Excuse me. Here are the menus. I'll come back to take your orders in a minute. Come on, move your ass! I'm hungry. - Are you really hungry? - Yes, I'm hungry. What did you say? I asked for four glasses and a bottle of water, thank you. What's her problem? Stupid woman. - This is very nice. - Here you go. - What's this? - An old relaxation technique. Just throw rocks at my head when I pass by, let it all out! You won't get cancer. Whiskey on the rocks. Thank you. Esra, what was that all about? This can't go on like this. Didn't you hear how she spoke to me? Would I allow that? - Please calm down. - Whose side are you on? We're not your enemies. We all love you. But this behavior is unacceptable. This is my restaurant. Did you hear what that woman said to me? No, I didn't, but no matter what she said, you can't treat customers like that. - I don't care. - No, I don't care at all. - It doesn't concern you. - No! You're doing the same thing! You're laughing in my face and talking behind my back! You don't have the guts to come and ask me what the problem is! And then you act like I'm the problem! - Enough, Esra. - What? This is my restaurant, you're not forced to work here. If you can't behave properly, you can leave. Either control your feelings or go. - Control my feelings? - Yes. Me! My feelings are to blame again. "Esra needs to learn to control her feelings." Great! "Esra, control your feelings!" "Adapt to the customs and rules, Esra!" "Esra, sit down!", "Esra, stand up!" You know what? I'm telling all of you! I don't give a shit about this job! Is this what you call love? I don't need it! This kind of love can go to hell! Sorry, please continue with your meal. May love like that go to hell! Your next drinks are on the house, thank you. Let's get back to work, guys. Hey! I'm sorry if we caused any trouble. Anneliese can be a bit crazy sometimes. Hey there. My new hero has arrived. Where were you just now? Go to your silly girlfriend. She's definitely silly, but she's not my girlfriend. - What's your name? - Screw off. My name is "Screw off". "Wow! Don't keep your anger inside! You'll get cancer." Here, throw this at me too, let's even things out. Oh, you're so funny! - Okay. - What are you doing? - Are you crazy? - Esra! Esra... I like your name. Run! Don't ever come back here! You're the one breaking the sign, and the guy is shouting "Esra" after you. I can't believe this. I lost my job because of you, and now you're following me around. Is it my fault now? You had already stirred things up. - Yes, it's your fault. Just leave! - Fine. Don't shout, I'm going. Are you deaf? I'm going home. This is the way to my house. You enjoyed throwing that stone, I know. Why did you throw it? Why, why? It's an old relaxation technique. And are you making fun of me? Are you making fun of me? Okay, I'm sorry. No problem. Ms. Inal, I'm trying to sleep here. I'm trying to sleep every night too, Ms. Lobatski. Goodnight! Damn it! Look. Wait a second. So now you want me? - What's your name? - I have some pride too. Oh, never mind. Mo. My name is Mo, okay? Mo. Mo? Who names someone "Mo"? It's Mo. Short for "Muhittin". Even for me, it's hard to pronounce. How will Germans do it? You're a Turk. Your Turkish is funny. Do you have a lighter? - What does that mean? - A lighter. Okay, good. Can you come with me? Come with me. I'm not gonna hurt you or anything. Go ahead. This way? Okay. Walk towards the kitchen! Go, go. Be quick about it. Hold on, hold on. Which way? Turn right. Okay, no problem. - I'm sorry. - Straight, straight. Turn right from here. Right, right. - From here? - Yes. Okay. Keep going. - There was supposed to be a candle around here. - Okay. - Did you find it? - Yes. Okay. I can't leave the lighter behind, it's important to me. Then you can't go anywhere, sit there. Okay. I'll make coffee. There's no electricity, but I'll squeeze some oranges. Thank you. These are beautiful. Where did you get them? I made them myself. For those who can't afford the electricity bill. Are you still mad about that crappy sign? Don't worry, I'll pay for it. I'll also tell them that it was me who broke it, you had nothing to do with it. Do you think you did me a favor? I couldn't pay the electricity bill. I spent all my money on furniture. I don't have any more money, and I lost my job. I'm screwed. Can I ask you something? How did you hear what Anneliese said to you? - It was incredibly noisy in there. - I didn't hear it, I felt it. - You felt it? - Yes. - What do you mean, "I felt it"? - Like I said, I felt it. - You felt like a superhero? - Yeah, exactly. Okay, okay. Okay, can you feel what I'm thinking right now? - Do you want to hear it? - Yeah. You're sleeping here. She really is a superhero. - Did you say something? - No, no. Goodnight then. I paid for this. Yay! Got some breakfast too. If you're looking for someone to share the rent with, I know someone. - Who's that? - I thought you can read minds? Me, of course. I'm clean, compatible, quiet, and smell nice. - What do you do for work? - I'm in import-export. I can also help you with the lamps. I know a lot of people. - Do you work nights? - Nights? Never! Nights are for fun. I have things to do, you have things to do. I won't disturb you. - Okay. - Okay to what? You can stay here. - I can? - You can. That was too easy! I had prepared so much to say. Housemate? My housemate! Okay, I'll go get my things. That was fast! - Where were you living before? - Just around the corner. - Can I put my stuff in? - Of course. - Thank you. - Sure. There are some rules in this house, let me tell you. Okay. What are they? - I don't know yet, but there will be some. - Okay. - Okay. - What's in this box? We're going to earn money from it. You're talented from birth. - Wow. - Come on, let's play now. - Play? What game? - Come on. Okay. 150, please. I'll take two, thank you. - Good evening, Mo. - Good evening, you look great. Thank you. Here we are. Come on, pick a machine! Okay. - Let's try this one. - Okay. Sit down. Throw the money here, then press the button. Okay. - Damn it. - I don't like this one. - You don't like it? - No. Let's continue. I found one. - Excuse me. - Okay. - Yes. - Okay. Throw the money. Then pull the lever. Quickly. Okay. - Wow! - What's happening? You won! What does that mean? We made so much money! Wow! - Okay. - Thank you. - Is there room service? - Of course. Great. Okay. Bring me a little bit of everything. And some champagne. Yes, sir. You're not one of those women who loves shopping, are you? I am one of them. This is called "speed shopping." You have one hour. You'll buy whatever you feel like without thinking. - Got it? - Got it. Get ready... Go! Are you okay? - What's wrong? Are you okay? - I can't breathe! Calm down. - Call a doctor. - I can't breathe. The doctor said you need to rest. Let me prepare the bathtub for you. Then you can sleep well and we'll be distributing the casinos again tomorrow! - Really? - Of course. We've seen the gems in you. Sit down first, sit. - Mo... - Are you okay? Okay, okay. Everything's fine. Where are my shoes? Did you get everything? Okay, you've really recovered. You've recovered. Let's take off your shoes. You'll see. Everything will work out. Bathroom. Mo! I had a dream, Mo. It was so realistic. Mo! - Essi! - Stay away from me! I said stay away! Go away! Just go! It's okay now. I had a dream. - Okay, it's over. - A nightmare... I'm here with you. If only I could understand what's happening in your dreams. Why are you scared... What's happening to you? Okay. My dreams are like a second life to me. I feel like I'm conscious, like I'm awake. Then something happens and I realize I'm in a dream. And that scares me a lot. I try everything to wake up. I'm afraid of not being able to come back. At some point, I wake up but I feel like something inside me has changed. I feel like I'm not the same as before. Imagine you're entering a bedroom right now and you see your sleeping body inside. How would you feel? - I'd probably lose my mind. - Exactly that feeling. And since I was a child, I've been seeing a man in my dreams. He doesn't talk to me but I still trust him. I can even say that I love him. - Do you love him? - No, not like I love you. So you love him. Mo, I'm really scared of losing my mind. I'm afraid of sleeping now. Come here, come. I don't know where you will wake up in your dreams or who you will meet. But from now on, I promise to be by your side every time you open your eyes. Okay? There are thousands of books about dreams. Really? Look, the whole shelf is full. Let's buy them. - Enough! - It's me! It's me! Okay. It's fine. "Our dreams are the memories of things we have forgotten or ignored. They are the mirror of our expanding souls." My love, what do you think I am forgetting? What am I ignoring? Maybe you are just forgetting to enjoy. We will read them all until we find the answer, okay? - There are eight different dream levels. - Really? So far, I have read about physical, astral, and etheric levels. - I've re... - I've read. But there are five more. The pot has found its lid. Sis! As far as I understand, Esra is operating at the third level. And... But sometimes she jumps. I do! My child, what kind of work are you involved in? I started a business and gained some experience. A lit-little bit finance. But now I'm in import-export business. By the way, where do you work? At the restaurant? No, sis, I'm at home, working on my lamps. Shouldn't you get into a proper job? We already have an accountant and a banker. So it'd be good if I filled the gap, right? You guys can take care of me. I wish you took your real life as seriously as your dreams. Sister, let's assume this is my job. To worry about a dream and to worry without a dream. This is also a difficult job, isn't it, Mom? I wish someone would give me money for this. Well, I wouldn't. I would. Take it, sweetheart. Thank you, Dad. - Long time no eat mother's cooking. - Oh really? Thank you Emine aunty, your hands are blessed. Enjoy your meal, son. Don't worry, I will call you when I meet the guys. - Still, be careful. - You take care of your girlfriend. - Hi. - Hi, honey. Hello! Look, it's Esra. - See you later. - Bye. Bye. Who were they? Tom and Laura. They were also at the cafe the day we met. So, who were the guys you had to watch out for? Did you do cocaine there? It was just a little line. A very, very small line. Don't look like that. I'm going to take you to an amazing place now! A really great place. Come on, don't look so sour. Look, how beautiful our life is. Yes. Come. Do you see the Milky Way? Our galaxy. Do you know how long it takes for the solar system to orbit the galaxy? No. 255 million years. Wow, that's long. We live our lives as if they're eternal. But from the perspective of the sun a human life lasts only eight seconds. Can you imagine? Just eight seconds. - How do you feel? - Mortal. Yes. That's why I'm here. To remind us that we need to live as if everything could end at any moment. It's really like every moment is our last moment. Damn it! Anyway, forget it. - Too much. - What? - Don't reveal everything. - If you're afraid, you'll lose, okay? Are you crazy? All our money is in that. - Come on, sit down, come. - Come, play too. What? - Are you serious? - Yes. No, it's just a game. Relax a bit. Number 13... Draw a card, my love. Go on, draw. Card. Miss? Draw one. - Card. - Card. Damn it! - Why did you do that? - You told me to. Yes, but it was your turn, you should play, you should decide. - This is your game, isn't it? - Don't do this now. I want to go home, Mo. I'll get our money back, then I'll go, okay? - I'm not feeling well. - Just a minute, please. What? What are you doing? - I can't breathe. - We have to win this. - Are you okay? - Yes, there's no problem. - Are you sure? - Yes, really. Thank you. - Do you want a card? - Just a second, please. Should I take a card or not? Please tell me. Please. - Sir? - Just a second, please. Get yourself together, please. These are ours... Please, come on. - Take the stupid card out. - Should I take it out? - Take it out! - The card? - The card? - Yes, the card. - Yes! Good for you! - Good job. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I told you to wait in the car. Mo, who are these guys? What are you getting involved in? I'm in the middle of a deal right now, don't interfere. I don't like the look of these guys. Come on, stop talking nonsense and go to the car. Be careful how you talk to me, okay? Listen to me, go to the car. If you don't come in five minutes, I'll come back. Just letting you know. You almost ruined the job for me. - I was trying to protect you. - Like I need protection! - Do I look like that kind of person? - Yes! I think you shouldn't take risks like this anymore. This is who I am! This is my life! I am like this, I take risks. Let me tell you what happens to you. You turn into a crazy pig. The moment you step into that casino, a monster comes out of you. That's exactly what happens. - Obsessive and... - Am I supposed to learn about my sanity from you? Yes! Yes! "I can't breathe!" "I'm dying!" - "Oh, it was just a dream!" - You're disgusting! Disgusting! - "Mo! Hold me, Mo!" - Shut up! Shut up! Let me go! I'll show you your place. Ms. Inal? Do you have pets at home? Because the rule is... We were rehearsing for a play. It's almost over. Everything's fine. Is everything really okay? You're shaking. I've really gotten into my role! "That man... I don't know... Do I love him? Does he love me?" Mo, you are an animal. A wild animal. He shouldn't break character either. Okay, but just 10 minutes! Artists, you know! Where were we? Where were we? You need to quit gambling. Promise me. Okay, I promise. I promise. - Promise? - I promise. Okay. Essi, where is the bag I left here? - I need to pay the electricity bill. - I already paid it, honey. - The rent needs to be paid too. - There are still ten days left for that. Don't mess with me. I won't gamble. - I just want to pay the rent. - Six days! You lasted six days! I don't want to gamble! Just give me... - Where is the money? - I can't hear you, Mo. - I can't hear you, Mo. I can't hear you. - Then turn off the TV! - I got this for you, remember? - Are you crazy? You got it for yourself. Okay, take your bag! I love your TV, Mo. I'd really love to see your play. When is the premiere? Soon, ma'am, very soon. Okay. What are you doing there? - Do you see this? - What is that? Give me that. What is this? - Please. Please. - What is this? Is this your import-export? Is this your import-export? Someone has to make money. Is this how you're going to make money? By selling drugs? Give it to me! Shame on you! - Give it to me, Esra! - Take your filthy thing! Don't ever bring this to my house again! Do you hear me, Mo? - Your house? - Mine. That means it's your house. - Then I can leave. - What does that mean now? What's going on, I'm asking you! - Let's see how you'll sleep alone. - What? - You leave when it's not convenient. - Yes. Then get out of here! Get out! Cut it out! Muhittin! You're staying here. Mo! I told you to stop! Are you listening to me, Muhittin? That was really close. Do you think you're Superman now? All of this is getting too much for me. - You have to help me. - Buckle up. - What? - Buckle up. - Mo! - What's up? Essi? Can you see if there's a woman with a stroller passing by? Yeah, a woman with a baby carriage just went by. What's going on? The wall has dissolved, Mo. - Essi, it is fine. - The wall has dissolved! The wall has dissolved, Mo. What if my body dissolves too? The wall has dissolved! Let me go! This is just a dream, believe me! Call an ambulance! I'm not well! This place isn't real! It is not! Mom? Sweetheart? Thank God, you're awake! I had a terrible day. You've been sleeping for four days. Mrs. Inal, do you know why you are here? I don't feel very well. Can you tell me why? Nothing that I thought was real. Things I heard, things I saw, voices in my head... Nothing feels real anymore. Do you hear voices? As much as you do. How did you know I hear voices? Isn't there a voice in your head that evaluates and comments on everything? We call that voice "the mind." Does it matter what we call it? Have you ever tried silence it? Mrs. Inal, why do you think others are happy with it, but you are not? Are you happy? You are on the verge of divorce with two children. You can't sleep at night. I don't think you love yourself. And you're not here just because you want to be here. You are here because you have to be. Don't you think that's unfair to yourself? Where are you getting all this from? Just pay a little attention. Ms. Klein, what you see in me, you have it in yourself too. Ms. Inal, we will need quite some time to discuss all of this. Oh, my darling. Sweetheart. - My angel. - Dad. We'll come to visit you in a few days, okay? Okay, Mom. We need to go. I'm sorry. We need to go, okay? I'm sorry. At that moment, I wanted to ask my father if God could hear me from here too. Mom! Dad! No! No! Dad! Dad, get me out of here! Can you tell me why my butt is exposed? It's because of your gown. But don't worry, your clothes are with us. Your mother will also bring you comfortable clothes. Then give me another apron, don't you have another model? Let me see if we have any Louis Vuitton aprons left from last season. Unfortunately, we don't have any. Ms. Ludwig, we don't touch each other like this here. We don't sit like this either. I want to move a little, I want to go outside. We have rules, Ms. Inal. But everyone goes outside for two hours a day. When we are sure that no one will be harmed, you can also go out alone. - Who could I harm? - Yourself, Ms. Inal. Ms. Inal! Ms. Inal! Ms. Inal! Ms. Inal, please come inside. If you don't come inside now, we will have to force you. Excuse me, how long does Esra need to stay here? It's hard to say until a diagnosis is made, but you can give me some answers that could help. Is there anyone in your family who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia? - Schizophrenia? - Yes. Symptoms include hearing voices, seeing and feeling things that others don't see or feel. Some people are convinced that they spoken to God or have seen him. Good Lord. Since when has hearing God become an illness? - What did he say? - It's not important. These will help you sleep, and make you feel better. The nurse was right. These pills solved my problem with being human. Because I didn't have any more dreams. And because there were no dreams, there was no waking up either. What are you doing, Ms. Inal? I put on a smiling face today. How does it look? I'm glad you're finally smiling, but you'll regret doing that. I would be surprised if I didn't regret something for even one day. You have a visitor, Ms. Inal. A visitor? Mo! Everything is so bad when you're not here. It wasn't great when I was here either. I think it was. I wish I was someone else so we wouldn't have to go through this. Do you really want to stay here? They could keep you here for years. I don't believe you're really sick. You don't need this. I'm here, I'll take care of you. They need to diagnose me first. Okay. We both know that if you really want to, you can easily get out of here. Okay? Okay. What's this? Take your medicine. Like this, hold on. Like this. Ms. Inal, how do you feel? I'm doing very well. Your treatments have been very helpful to me. Have you been able to silence the voices in your head? I'm still working on it. How about you? According to the tests we've conducted there's no evidence that would require us to keep you here any longer. If you want to go home, you can go. Yes. Of course. It is very important that you continue to take your medication. Of course, I will. The taste isn't bad either. So can I go home? I had convinced everyone that I was doing better, except for myself. Welcome home, my dear. I'm thinking of buying some fabric tomorrow and starting to make lamps. First, why don't you sell these? They're taking up space everywhere. I'll take them to the shop in Prenzlauerberg. And then I'll go to the fabric store. I have new ideas. - I can take you there tomorrow. - Really? - Yes. - Great. I'm sorry, I need to go out for a bit. Tonight? Actually, it's not important. I can do it tomorrow. Okay? - What are you doing? - I need to stop by Tom's. - Is it the right time for it? - I'll be right back. Don't worry. Wait, I'll come with you. We have visitors. Mo, what's going on here? I'm Detective Maurer. Can I ask what you're doing here? - Where's Laura? - Can I see your identification? Where's my friend? I want to see my friend! - Can I see your ID? - I want to see my friend. Where is she? Please calm down, this is an investigation. The girl is pregnant, about to give birth. Your friend is in the hospital. She gave birth, both are doing well. Now give me your IDs. Check the bedroom. Wait here. I want you to check the information of two people. Don't panic. Trust me. What are you doing? Akın? Can you go to my colleague? Please behave. Please lean your hands against the wall. - Ms. İnal? - Yes? We may need to talk to you and Mr. Akın again. For now, you can go and see your friend. They're at Neuköln hospital. One last thing... Are we really going there? We can stay here if you want, but you can tell the guys behind us that we don't care about our friends. There's a cop behind you. Don't let him see. - Where's Tom? - I don't know. - Is he okay? - Ask the guy behind you. Go away! This is what you deserve. This is what you deserve. I hate you. I have lost faith. I lost faith in myself, love, and life. I have lost faith in everything I held to be true. These never-ending pains. Every attempt to stand up leads to another defeat. I simply can't find peace anymore. Neither in the day nor at night. For years, I've been trapped between two worlds. Between truth and lies. My beloved mother. Nobody has ever accepted and loved me as you did. Like a programmed piece of flesh, I'm forced to be who they want me to be. They want me to keep my mouth shut and not question anything. I can't do that. Because the quieter I become, the louder my dreams become. Hayat, Sevgi, Aylin. To fall into your loving hands was the most beautiful thing that could happen. You were the greatest protection of my fragile heart. My beloved father. You once said that our bodies were just clothing, and that we would return them when the time came. I can no longer wear this clothing, Dad. I'm so sorry for doing this to you. Every single tear you will shed, I'm sorry. I sincerely wish that God forgives me. Because I never stopped loving Him. Just as I never stopped loving you. My beautiful family. It was an honor for me to live with you and receive your love. I have engraved your faces into my soul and will take them with your love into eternity. I will never forget you. Esra. Esra? Esra! What did you do, Esra? Ms. İnal, can you hear me? Can you please open your eyes? I'll take care of this, you rest. Okay? Essi? Can you please open the door? Essi? Essi, can you open the door? I don't want to be with you anymore, Mo. Let's not hurt each other anymore. I do love you, my love, but... Just go. Essi. Essi. Please open the door. Essi. Please open the door. I made one mistake, Esra. A stupid mistake. Open the door, please! Open the door, please! Looks like rehearsals are over. I'm responsible for you. You are entrusted to me. Everything turned out just the way we wanted. From now on, I am responsible for you. I'm here, I'll take care of you. To be afraid of nights was a habit of years. Sometimes, time is needed for things to change. I was ready for this change. Or more precisely, I had no choice, but to change. From now on, you are entrusted to me. I will look after you until my last breath. Give me a little time because I'm still a beginner. We'll make it through. So you're real! You're real! You're literally real! In Mexico? In two weeks? - Thank you. - No. Thank you. Hello, I'd like a ticket for the Mexico City flight at four o'clock, please. The four o'clock flight is full. When is the next flight? It's really important, please check again. - You should have bought your ticket earlier. - Yeah. There's a seat available on the nine o'clock flight. Oh, great. Okay. You can take this. Mo, I told you not to call me. Essi, please don't hang up. We need to talk, it's important. I can't talk right now, I'm hanging up. I want to go home. I can't do this without you. I'm in trouble, Esra. I can't come, Mo. I'm at the airport. I'm going to Mexico. - Mexico? - Yes. Goodbye. Hello. Ms. Esra Inal is here. Thank you. - Please wait here. - Why? My colleagues are coming, just wait a second. - Hello. Is this Mrs. İnal? - Yes? - Could you please come with us? - What happened? - You'll find out in a bit. - But my flight is leaving. Mrs. İnal, we've met before, do you remember? Yes. First of all, may I ask why you go to Mexico City? Why wouldn't someone want to go to Mexico? I was going to see the pyramids. Assuming you didn't make me miss my flight, of course. Is this legal what you're doing? I don't think you have the right to do this. Mrs. İnal, I understand your anger very well. But I have to do my job as well. When was the last time you saw Muhittin Akın? - About two weeks ago. Why? - He called you today. Yes, he wanted to meet, but I refused. Is that a crime? We know he's involved in a large-scale operation with a Ukrainian drug gang. Do you know anything about it? We need information about his connections. I have no idea. I don't know anything, and I don't want to know. I don't care who he met with, where or when. Okay? If you see him, tell him to stay out of my sight. If you excuse me now, I'm heading to my plane. Ms. Inal, unfortunately, that's not possible. We found his body in a hotel room today. Shot. If it wasn't this important, we wouldn't keep you here. I'm sorry. For me, Mo had not died, but only awakened from being human. He was now in a different dream. On a different orbit around the sun. But that thought couldn't console me either. Bu yüzden buradayım Esra. That's why I'm here, Esra. To remind you every day that we have to live as if it's our last. Truly, as if every moment could be our last. The Four Agreements. The man from the dreams still accompanies me with his love. In the years with him, I learned to be sincere and not to take anything personally, not to jump to conclusions and to always do my best. The most important thing is: I have learned to trust my dreams. Now I share everything I have learned with others. And if I manage to make someone aware that they can change their destiny, it would make my heart smile. - Hi, how are you? - Come in. You have done so much for me. I thank you for that. Will you forgive me? I have made mistakes too. You don't have to forget them. You forgive me too. Dad. Should I tell you a secret? God loves me very much. Dear God, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Welcome home. Come. I have tried to sow seeds of love. Some I forgot to water, and they withered. Some I gave too much to, and they withered away. But I never gave up and kept sowing new ones. And in the end, it started to bloom. I realized that this was only possible through forgiveness. Now I want one thing from you. Leave this cinema forgiving at least one person in your life. Translator: theedoraa Remember, you only have eight seconds for this. - Mrs. Lobatzki. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm very good. I have a surprise for you. - For the premiere! - Wow, finally. Thank you. - You'll come, won't you? - Of course, good luck.
