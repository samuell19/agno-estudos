But I really want to grant her last wish Aha... Why are you staring at me? You think I can find a Louis Koo for you? Yes, you can A friend of mine owns a nightclub in Bumfuk China He has a stable of celebrity look-alikes One is a dead ringer for Louis Koo! Are you sure? It's true! My Snowy is gravely ill.

Why don't you take Tuen Mun Road? It's faster... Sham Sui Po, Mongkok, Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Tung My territory spread across the harbor to Wanchai, Causeway Bay and eventually Lan Kwai Fong! In those days everyone knew Brother Gordon People still know you, Boss If no one wants Kam. . I, Gordon Bro, will take her! I wouldn't cry if I could laugh... wouldn't be lonely if I found my soul mate Pity that I've never met her How could a wanderer like me get close to anyone? Bravo... Your turn?

Brother! You make a lot of sense What do you think of our restaurant? Kam... You're paying 150 grand a month for rent... on top of renovations, overhead and staff But you're selling cheap fast food? You'll only clear 300 grand tops But you also have to support this... brother It's doesn't make economic sense Brother! That's where you're wrong! Where did you find this guy? Big Brother, give me some face... Take him inside first Kam? You too? Get up! Get in there! Get in there! How did you come up with such an idea?

Who bestowed this honor? Hello Hi The Chief Executive has spoken! Even you call me that, no wonder I feel so stressed lately Help me relax? Help the Chief Executive? Yes! You must run for the Chief Executive office! No! You must do it! I even thought of slogans: "if Andy Lau runs HK, he'll give us endless treat" "No need to flee HK with Andy as our Chief" You be the judge Can this man be our Chief Executive?
