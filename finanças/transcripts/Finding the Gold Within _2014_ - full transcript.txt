Go into this journey with me. I need your ears. See with your ears. They will become your new eyes. They will become your new nose. They will become your new senses. The origin of alchemy with chem, c-h-e-m in the middle, is from the ancient Egyptian, and it means “Black”. It means the knowledge of darkness. Once you get down into dark knowledge, which is also another word for “wisdom”, inside that darkness is where the gold is found. The reason most people don't find gold is because they're not willing to go far enough into the darkness. So Alchemy is about entering the darkness to find the hidden gold. The alchemist would take that primal material, which is that base substance, that people would just throw away. But it's that substance, that if you take it through that chemical process, you can extract gold out of it. 99.9% Black. 85% percent or so low-income. 70% single-parent families. 80% first-generation college student, assuming they're going to college. You know how it starts. Once upon a time, surely not this time, in a place surely not this place, there was this old king who became sick, and he requested that Faithful John be summoned. That was his faithful servant. So he asked Faithful John, that I would request that you become a foster father to my son and show him the ways of how to live. And one day, the king's son said, “Why do you keep passing up that room?" "I need to see what is in that room.” And he rushed to the room and he couldn't push the door open. And he said, “I will stay here until that door is opened.” Write down what is about to quote unquote die in your life. Are you bringing closure to it? What is coming to an end right now in your life? Anybody want to speak on that? Brandyn. Maybe it's like dependency, like growing up the whole time, you're kinda dependent on your parents, whether or not you got both parents or just the mom. One of the most beautiful things that Kwame has taught us to do is, he kinda taught us how to think and how to go outside of the box. And that's one of the things that nobody can ever take away from you, is just the gift of your mind. Write down what in your future are you willing to die for. Man, I would die to see my grandfather back on this earth, just to see his face again. Thanks, man. The beautiful woman for me was myth. See, that's what I was willing to die for. That's what I was willing to make all sorts of sacrifices for, okay? What is it that really makes your blood boil? What is it that you love? For Nate, it's track. Marlon, football. Sam, wrestling. Brandyn, it's music. Darius, poetry. He walked in ahead of the king's son, and the king's son got up on his tiptoes and he looked over Faithful John's shoulder. When he saw the princess, he immediately became faint and fell to the ground. I think the only reason why Faithful John didn't faint when he saw the picture is because he has experienced passion and love, but the kings son has yet to experience it. He has yet to notice it. Antoine. This is my middle name, but the last thing I expect anyone outside of my family to call me. It's the last connection I have with my father. I actually had an argument with him the other day. I wrote another poem, and I said something negative about him in it, and he didn't understand the purpose of me putting something negative in the poem. And that really hurt, because that wasn't the first time. He shut down that part, and in Alchemy, that part is welcome, because there's other people like that that have had a father hurt them. So it's like I have a constant shutdown from him and a constant opening in Alchemy to share that. It's brought a perspective, and it's brought a sense of security at times when I really didn't feel secure. Going through the African rites of passage, I got introduced to the work of Carl Jung, and I was just amazed at his, his concept of the collective unconscious and the shadow and the anima. So that's when I started reading mythology. Joseph Campbell and Power of Myth. You'll find myths in Africa, Asia, Europe, Japan, America. They're all basically saying the same thing. And then from that, Michael Meade's Men and the Water of Life. When I read that, that was pretty much it. I was working at University of Akron at the time, and I was counseling students, primarily Black males, and it was like pulling teeth getting them to talk. And what I found is that through a myth, it removes you from the situation and it allows you to look at life objectively. I'm basically a child of Michael's. Alchemy is my child, so that makes Michael your grandfather. In the ancient world, people thought this world, that they call the real world, had to first be dreamed up in the other world in order to exist. So this is a story about dreams. Once upon a time, there was a village, and the people in the village were simple, down-to-earth folk, and everybody did their jobs, and everybody went their ways, and not much changed from day to day inside that village. But at night, dreams would pound on the roofs of the houses. And one night, a dream was pounding on the roofs, and it came to a certain man. And in the dream, a voice spoke, and the voice said to him, “Isaac,” for that was his name, “Isaac, it's time for you to leave.” And it took such a long time to travel back that his clothes came back into style. Isaac entered the village all styled up again, a little dusty but looking good. And when he entered his own village, he went straight to his hut, and there, shining from the back of the hearth, was a treasure of gold. And Isaac took all the gold out of the hearth. Isaac built a great hall and then he invited all of the people of the village into the hall, and when the people came in, he gave them something to drink and he gave them some food, and then Isaac would simply ask them one question, “Have you had a dream?” And soon the people began to share their dreams, and were going in all directions, following their dreams, walking on the feet of the dreams, and I hope that something of Isaac's intelligence and courage will enter each one of you as you walk out onto the road of life, and I hope that you find some gold. And if you don't find it out there, remember this: You can always find it deep at the back of your own heart Isaiah. What resonated with me was how his friends tried to bring him down, bring down his dream. On his journey to his dream, he didn't look left nor right, not paying attention to distractions. Somewhere along the road, everybody gets in trouble on the road. You can't help that. But it's important to have, we call them friends of the deep self. You could call them Alchemy friends. Friends who know that you're a beautiful person and know that you have gold inside you and that support you. We hope the dream finds them again. You know what I'm saying? That the dream keeps trying to come back, because our life is really a body wrapped around a dream. I'll be graduating June 5th. I'll be attending Akron, maybe political science. I'm thinking maybe auditioning for another music school after my first year. I'm going to study psychology and political science. I'm going to Eastern Michigan University. I report for football to Tiff in on August 10th, so I'm going to take that and I'm going to roll with that as another open door that came into my life. Football scholarship. I'm attending Kent State University in the fall. I will be majoring in theater studies. Work it! You got it! I just love the way that the myth reflects our lives. It's overwhelming, to be completely honest, at times. You just have to step back and say, “Wow.” Alchemy, man. It's the way to do it! I was really excited going into this semester. I was ready to move out of my parents' house. I started to slowly see that it's not really as easy as you think it is. It's hard having the house and maintaining everything on your own. But then into October, I got a phone call one day, and I came home and my house had been broken into. Pretty much everything that l had, I lost. That just showed me how cruel the world can really be at times. I found out that my brother hadn't paid the electric or heating bill, so my gas and my hot water was cutoff, and I'm working about twenty hours a week, sixteen credit hours at the same time. I roughed it. I enjoyed my classes. I declared my major to be a political science major, and this year I had a US. Government and Politics class. Every day I was excited to come to class. In college, you're a completely new person coming out of your comfort zone and finding who you are in the world. Hey, Mom. Hey, son, what's up? My mom is truly my best friend. My mom is my everything. My mom is my heart Oh, you cooked here? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm... what did you make? I made French toast, sausage and hash browns. And you washed the dishes? At like twelve o'clock at night. I told everybody today at work, my son got a 3.4, first semester in college, freshman. I'm very proud of you. I am so proud of you. My parents, they divorced before I was born. My dad was incarcerated. He went to jail. It wasn't until I was about four that I met my dad. When we would meet, we always watched cartoons, and he gave me comic books. Superman, Batman's my favorite, the Green Lantern. Just their adventures and I was kinda identifying with them. Those were who I looked up to and I idolized, really, instead of a dad. Music is the beautiful woman in the myth for me. There are many days that I wake up just with melodies and harmonies singing in my heart, and music's the one thing that no matter where I go or no matter what I do, it won't leave me. That's something, just as well as thinking in my mind, that no one can take away from me at all. I can see that you've been hurt, but on top of that, what you deserve, I'm just asking that you hear me out, 'cause the bullshit I come without. Without a doubt, I'm not a mistake, but you'll never make a shot if you don't take. Oh, he's got sunshine and she's got rain, And he's got the time and the place to stay the night. I wouldn't like to think of myself as a musician. I would like to think of just a kid who has a knack for melodies and storytelling. for it, he'd give almost anything at all. She can have it all. Oh, he's got sunshine and she's got rain, and he's got the time and the place to stay the night. I'm finding the raw material within myself and then I'm refining it. Hopefully, turning it into something beautiful that I can share with everybody else. And shes got a smile that's seldom seen and for it, he'd give almost anything at all. I'll give my all. Yeah, sweet. To me, that's finding the gold within. That's my own personal process of alchemy. The White Snake myth resonated with me so much because I've never been able to just be a normal kid growing up. I did viola for four years, and then I got into piano, and just sort of stayed with the arts, and hearing that myth, it just felt like that was me, and all I needed was that taste or that bite of the white snake, and then everything was going to be just visible to me and audible, and I could hear and see everything. I grew up with a pretty stable, financially and morally, family. With Chrysler, the car dealership and the buyout, my dad lost his job, and then moved out. My mom lost her job from the hospital, and all this kinda hit all at the same time. That happened in sixth grade. I didn't see my dad a lot after that. The fact that he wasn't staying still, I had a lot of resentment for my parents, and for a lot of people around me, because I grew up in such a nice home and then that hit. Everything just kinda died. And I don't think I really understood what was going on. I was still maturing. My mom, she turned to alcohol, so things got really tough. I became sort of self-reliant, and started creating plans for myself. I got myself into these programs. My grandma really helped me out through all these things, too. She was always there like a rock. I can't blame anybody. I can thank my parents, though, because they got me my foundation, and then they couldn't. All that stuff happening really made me who I am now. It was scary at first, just thinking about being away from home and not having familiar people that I knew. I chose Eastern Michigan University because I didn't want to go to any school in Ohio. I didn't have a broad choice because I didn't have the money to go around and see colleges, so just picked this one. I'm on loans and grants totaling around 21,000 right now. I try not to think about it right now, because that's really depressing. I had a vision: psychology. I was going to follow it all the way, but turns out there's not a lot of things to do in psychology as far as money. I'm going to switch over to political science and see where that goes. I love learning. Learning the truth interests me. I'll narrow it down to the state of the African-American male, and did you want to hear the story that relates to that? Okay, so I got connected to this guy through my roommate. We started working out. He invited me to this little ultimate Frisbee game at midnight, and we're standing outside and he made one racist joke. Laughed it off. I'm like, okay, that's whatever. I'll just ignore it. We keep walking, and the white guy, I heard him say nigger before, and then he said it two other times, and I just faded to the back of the crowd and I started thinking, “Calm down, it's not that serious.” Because that gets to me. Because I don't even let Black people call me nigger. I don't answer to that name. And then one of his friends from the front, he looks back, he's like, “Yo, sorry, Darius, I just made a racist joke.” I'm like, “Okay.” And then he put his arm around me, he was like, “Yeah, I said it's ironic the Black guy's in the back,” and that was my breaking point. I was done at that point. That was mind-blowing to me. You have a lot of dynamics there. You have the fact that it was made okay for him to think that its okay to say that word, for one, and how the racism comes out in jokes, and it's able to be laughed off, and people think it's okay. This comes to the African-American male, what I'm interested in. The African-American male is forced to internalize that. He goes out and attempts to be accepted in a society that constantly tells him he's not good enough to be a part of, and it's just internal, and it really pissed me off. And I felt like I've been taught enough to come at him in an intellectual and respectful way, telling him why that's not okay, why I don't go for that. But I called my mom. She told me some people aren't worth it. He's an ignorant person and you can't teach him. It's not your place to save him. So it took a while for me not to say anything to him, but that hurt. I didn't realize how mad I was. I put it in my poetry. That's it. Just to have something to bang my hands against repeatedly, it really gets it out, and to have the sound that goes with it, you have this rhythm and it just plays out. You begin to make a rhythm to how you're feeling and it feels great. I really love it with a passion. I want learn how to drum better. Good job. Let's just put the drums behind us. In silence, sending the vessel around, and dreams come true. Really think about what you want. We want them to follow more so their soul as opposed to conventional reality. Twenty-six out of twenty-eight going to college, and I think that's when those myths are really hit in. Good to see you brothers, man. It's been six months. Feel as if I got the best job in the world, from having majority of you guys from sixth grade all the way now to your first year in college. Write down today's date. 12/20/11. The name of the myth today is The Kings Ears. Once upon a time, there was a well-known, mighty, mighty king who had everything that a man desired. However, his secret was that he had ears like a goat under a beautiful crown. Like all men, he had to get a haircut. And he would summon barbers to come, and after they cut his hair, every one of them would say, “King, you look handsome, but however, you still have those goat ears.” And he would draw his sword and kill them right on the spot. We're going to pause right there for a moment. As always, just write down what resonated with you. No right or wrong answers. Sergio. What resonated with me was how it got to him to where it made him want to kill people. And it shows the insecurities about himself. If you're born with it, you just have to accept it because that's what makes you different and unique. This myth here deals with our deformities and insecurities. He who conceals his disease cannot expect to be cured. Now his crown is what distinguishes him from everybody. What happens when you remove your crown? Let's get Stacee. Coming to Kent, over the past few months, it's been hit, because I haven't really been able to study or focus on anything, really. Sometimes I get stuck on campus, and I don't really got nowhere to stay, I have to stay in a lounge somewhere and chill until the morning. Stuff is hard. So that's where I am right now, and that crown has been off. Thanks, Stacee. They say it's adversity that introduces a man to himself. Tyler. I think why stuff happened the way it did, and what were the intentions of things happening like that, you know, my sister passing away and everything. Sometimes I sit in my room and I cry, and I kinda just ask, “Why did you take her when she was so young?” And like Chevin was saying, I feel like life is not fair, but then again, what do you live for when the stuff that you try to do right goes wrong? Thanks, man. Richard Pryor said, you know, some shit was happening and Richard Pryor said, “Why me, brother?” “Why not you, brother?” Okay, and that's how life is, man. Thanks, Tyler. We're a small Division ll school, about two hours away from here. Tiff in University. I attended Akron Early College High School. It definitely maximized my fullest potential, because it put me way ahead of the game, so only got two years left until I graduate with my bachelor's degree. My major is sports management. I was thinking about becoming a sports lawyer. I do plan to pursue coaching, though, one day. Starting young, the quarterback is supposed to be the leader of the team, I just always try to put it in my mind that I've got to lead people, and I've got to show people the way. We've definitely got to work that GPA out, that's the one thing. We've got to get that up. Not that's it bad now, but getting on that dean's list and the presidents list is... where you're striving to be, that academic All-American. Right? - Yeah. How's stuff been here? Oh, it's been cool. My dad is a big leader throughout the community and a lot of people look up to my dad. He's a City of Akron police officer. He works second shift, three to eleven, but we try to spend as much time as we can together when I'm home. She was outgoing. She was a fun person. You never caught her without a smile on her face. No matter how hard Ebony partied Saturday, she was always up for church on Sunday. Nobody knows the story of what happened. She hit the wall and her car flipped over a few times and that's probably the hardest thing I ever had to endure throughout my eighteen years of living. She'll never lose her spot in my heart I actually had a dream one day, and my aunt, uncles, mom, dad and my sisters. I was playing and I stopped the game, and l walked over to her and I said, “I haven't seen you in forever. I miss you. Give me a hug.” When I hugged her, she hugged me back. Tears rolled down my eyes and that was a joy moment for me, because I felt like that was her sign of telling me, “I'm right here, little brother. I'm not going nowhere. I'm always going to be with you.” Oh boy. Good times, wasn't it? Yeah. That's somebody she worked with, isn't it? That's a nice pic. Is this Vegas? Vegas. I know what this one is. Kennede, her five-year-old daughter, I look at Kennede and I see Ebony so much. When she was calling me Uncle, it definitely makes me smile. I chose Case Western Reserve, and I really like the campus. It was a nice school, the best school I got into. And I was into the whole prestigious university thing. Right now I'm majoring in psychology, and at Case, we are required to take a first seminar's Sages class. The thing that made it great was that I had a terrific teacher. The students worked together incredibly. Everyone just seemed to have this good camaraderie from the beginning of the year. I'm taking out a lot of loans right now, and that's another reason my grades need to be so good. My mom's been on me, like, “Hey, keep those grades up, so they can help us pay for college.” I definitely do feel the pressure. This money can't go to waste. It's just too much. I come from a blessed background. I know a lot of the other kids in Alchemy don't, but I've never had to worry about a meal or not see my parents together or anything. I was raised in a two-parent household, and my parents have always provided well for me. They've always cared about me, loved me. My dream, honestly, and it's nothing huge, but I would really love to go into some field in psychology. And one thing I thought would be interesting was like going around, traveling the world and figuring out different ways people think in different countries. Right now it's between psychology and law. I'm still trying to find myself. C.J. I have my uncle. I mean, that's kinda my biggest male influence, and, I mean, everything he does is wrong, you know? He sells drugs. I kinda got the aspect as, well, fuck it, I can't do shit, I'm gonna be a statistic. So I got in some trouble and stuff, went to jail, got out. I mean, I'm out on bail right now. I don't know if I'm gonna go outside making the play, and not come home, you know? I don't even speak to my mom no more. I'm not in school right now. I'm on the streets. I ain't even gonna lie. I sell drugs. I mean, that's my everyday thing. I wake up in the morning, break down, and I go make a play, you know? That's how I get money. That college struggle that y'all talking about, I don't know what that feels like. It's everybody for themselves. That's what I grew up knowing, you know? I'm facing a felony two right now for robbery and assault. When I got out of jail, I was cool for a week, and then I was right back to the same thing that got me in jail. I don't know, man. I just... I don't know. lt's just hard, you know? Hey, thanks for sharing that. Dre, just look out for him. We got you. Thanks, C.J. Okay, Terence. The people you keep around you, that's who you're going to become. Man, just keep positive people around you, seriously, for real. Write this quote down. Two quotes. You judge a man by the company he keeps. You make your friends your teachers, and you mingle the friendly art of conversation with the advantages of instruction. Imani. I remember I went to one of the Copley football games. I saw you, it was right after you got arrested the first time. I went and asked you what's up and you're like, “Oh, I'm straight, blah-blah-blah.” I was like, “You know you can call me or my dad,” because I knew what you were going through, but you putting on that front, it's like what Milous said, just step off your horse, and you should never be too prideful for that. So don't just act like everything's all right when it's not. Right on, man. Yeah. Brandyn. When that break-in did happen, the first person that was there was my landlord and Kwame Williams. I can't even tell you how much that meant to me. You're out here in this big, you-better-make-it world. If you don't make it, it's gonna eat you alive. I am more confident than ever that you all have been trained already to go out there and face whatever issue's going to confront you. Feel the pain, but take that pain and let it become a motivator. You know, flip the script. The whole key is you have been prepared to face this monster that you're running into now. I hope you don't think you weren't supposed to face it. You need it for you to become who you need to become. This is the fire that needs to fortify you, burn you into that man. Allow that fire to burn in you, man, but stick to it. Stick to it, that's the whole key. You can make it happen. Great job, fellas. We'll get a group photo, then eat, okay? This is Hiram College. We're a private school. It was basically a scholarship, and I had to pay $2,000 a semester or something like that, so everything worked out and hopefully I can prove myself, so next year I won't have to pay anything at all. Shawntrail informed me a while back. They were charging him with theft, and it could've been a second-degree felony. And they had to prove that something was taken by force. Shawntrail, he would never call any fouls, and then when the attorney, Bill, called me, I gave him that example. And they're talking about him trying to plead to a felony. Yeah, never having been involved in anything. That's closing the door on a young person's career and life. That was just unacceptable. Where the hell is Shawntrail at? Yes. We were wondering where you were at, man. Yeah, I was coming. All right, good seeing you, man. Just sitting here talking about you, man. How are you doing, man? Seriously, how are you doing with being here? It was a lot to deal with, facing the case and all that stuff. That transitions from the summer and then to the school year, which I've got to try to focus on my work, and then focus on basketball. Trying to help out my mom, too, with financials, and then trying to work on schoolwork, projects and ten-page papers, and then leaving every two or three weeks, so I'm missing classes to go talk to my lawyer, go to court The jury was actually crying during the case. I didn't want to plead to it, but in a sense I did, because I just wanted it all to get over with. Once you get that label on you, its not over because you pleaded. That was the only reason why I knew in my mind and heart that I was really innocent and I didn't do anything. - Follow that. He asked me from day one to tell him the truth and nothing but the truth. And I said, “I didn't do it,” and we went back to court, I said, “You know what? I changed my mind. I don't want plead to it because I'm innocent. One day can change the rest of your life, so just be careful, man. I learned a lot. Oh, yeah. No shit. Yeah, so... I'm happy for you, brother. Thanks, man. The ability to find the hero within. Think about it. When my girlfriend was there at the court days with me, like the last one when I was proven innocent, they just dropped the case, and she jokes about it a little bit to this day, like when it was all over, and then when I went to go hug her, I started crying. She said, “Oh, you just look like a big baby.” It was funny. I smile every day, I pray, just thankful for everything. I wake up and just look outside and I'm so happy to be free, and I just know I learned a lot. Life is great. How do you think society sees you? Darius. I've got this drive to be heard. I feel like society really doesn't see me at all, so it's like if you're not going to see me, you're going to damn sure hear me. People walk past me like, “Oh yeah, that's just that dude.” Little do they know I'm going to change the motherfucking world. Shawn. For the people who know me, that type of society, they know me as a hard worker, somebody that's not a stranger to hard work, and a good athlete who knows education comes first, but for somebody who hasn't heard of me and doesn't know me, they just view me as their definition of a typical Black urban male. What's a typical Black urban male? Brandyn. The perception of the typical Black urban man is kinda like the world's worst fear. The world knows that we got it inside of us, but we choose to do the wrong thing, and the world really doesn't really understand why we're doing the wrong thing because they don't know the spots that we've been in, and at the same time, we're the biggest fear because when we get our shit together, we make it rain down. We're feared, period. People are just scared of us. If we succeed and then we just build on that, it's a wrap, basically. Thanks, Chevin. Lets get back to the myth. Lets get back. I take telling stories that seriously. To me, it's like the old African griot. It is the transfer of information, of learning, and you will get out of it what you need to get out of it. And I do believe that stories heal. We hold true to the fact, wounded people will continue to wound others until they are healed. Working at the International Office, I've become a lot more in tune with the way America affects other countries and the way their countries affect us. My interest in this subject has really grown over the past two semesters. I was leaning towards moving my major to global communication, and to just graduate with a minor in theater and in the fine arts. I would like to become more culturally sound, going and actually learning a different language, experiencing a new way of life, instead of being at Akron, or Kent, or just Ohio, for that matter. I've seen people come in who have been completely/just scared of Black people, in general, just because of the media and the way they portray them. I think it was a Saudi Arabian student, he came into the office. He requested not to have a Black male as his conversation partner, and my coworker, she asked him why. He said because he couldn't understand the way they talk, he doesn't like the way they dress. He said they were violent, that he was scared that they would hurt him. It just really caught me off guard that its really that strong, that one stereotype of the Black male. Racism and prejudice is still alive now. On my hat, this button says We Are EPIC. It's for a group I'm in called EPIC Seven. It's sort of like creating a community of Kent campus. We know that the campus is predominantly white. There's a lot of segregation, not purposeful, but it's there, just simply because white and Black students don't mesh that well. We actually had a march on Monday for Trayvon Martin, walking to the rock. What I felt that day, it was great to not only see our people as a race together, it was good to see people of all races together, fighting for human rights. Not just, “Oh, you're Black, so we gotta stick together.” “You're white, so we gotta stick together.” It's all about humankind. We all came from one human, so it's all about humankind. I've talked to you about this before, when people come up to me, they're like, “That white man, it's the white man.” It's not the white man. And you're letting it happen, and you have enough power to get away from that stereotype. Be honest, for real. It starts with yourself. They talk about the Black male code, and that's still real. I'm even careful about it. I keep my hands out of my pockets. When I walk in the store, if my hat's down, I turn it backwards so they see my face. If I have my hood up, I take my hood down. I'm very aware of what's seen as a threat, what's seen as gentle and fine. I'm really careful about that, especially up here. Thinking about changing my major from psychology to law, maybe with a double major. I focus more on the African-American male, so I'll say he. He was forced to watch his family be sold and taken every which way, powerless again. And now you have today, the stereotype of a Black male not being present in the home, being an absent father, and I tie that back into learned helplessness, from being taught that you just can't. You can't do it. The structure's set up to stop a Black man from doing certain things. I can try and try, but I'll still be in this box. I feel like a lot of African-American men just stop. Other peoples low expectations gives me something to push against, so it makes me try harder. I'm using the box as a stepping stone. Put down whatever one you enjoy more, not which one you dislike. How long is your poem? Just a page. Did you do racism or people trade? Slave trade. It wasn't people trade. Slave trade. Political correctness. I'm going to put the n-word on here. Is that cool? You're joking, right'? You don't have to write the word. I'm not telling you off, I'm just saying these words... You say these racist jokes, and deep down it bothers you, but you're conflicted, because the person who tells them are laughing like it's okay, like I'm just kidding, so you feel bad for being upset or being hurt by it, so you feel like you're the problem, so you internalize those feelings. What do we notice that is different about establishing credibility in a research paper compared to whatever it is you brought to class today? Darius? I did a poem so... my credibility is more based on how passionately I talked about what I was talking about. Okay, good. What did you write down about what you liked about Darius's work, or what surprised you? I was really surprised at the way he wrote so passionately. Okay, good. Just knowing Darius being goofy and all. Other folks? Anybody in the group want to share some thoughts on that? I kinda liked how he used the slang he used in the poem, so that he could emphasize that you shouldn't use it, basically. I feel like at the beginning of the semester, that would've pissed me off. I don't let it bother me, though. I know who I am, where I come from. I had given up on trying to be a lawyer, something fancy like that, and I was going to settle for, like, social work or something, but I went home and my grandma told me, “Shoot for the stars, because even if you miss, you'll be so high up that nobody can tell that you didn't reach the stars.” Currently, you have the musician, the athlete, and the lawbreaker, whether it be drug dealer or a criminal. You have those three things perpetuated and projected to you, and that's quite sad. I joined the poetry slam team. You became the bedroom across the hall. I called you last night, and we're looking each other in the eye, and through the cigarette smoke and slight haze of alcohol, I feel like I can finally call you brother. Let your name ring from mountaintops too high for men to climb, for having clouds too thick for eyes to see through, And make my words resonate with the gods. Cool. Lets just make a smooth transition. In the olden times in Greece, Aesclepius was like a healer or physician. People would come to him to be healed. So what we attempt to do is recreate the temple of Aesclepius. Instead of chanting, we drum. What we did right there was just cleansing. And then instead of healing through the dreams, we heal through the myths. What they're about to do now is just blow their dreams into the vessel. Reflect back for a moment where you were where you are right now, and then also just think down the road, and just remember that dreams come true. Like I said, it's just so great seeing you guys, and now we only see you guys twice a year, during the winter break and during the summer. Write down today's date. 6/20/12. The name of the myth is The Sultan's Handkerchief. Let's take that journey, that journey to another place, another time. Long, long ago, there was a sultan, and this sultan lived in a golden palace. And that day when he did meet her, her beauty made him instantly fall in love. But she said there was one stipulation, “The only way that I would marry him is that he acquire a trade. That sultan, he said, “You know what? I see that your daughter is not only beautiful, but she is equally as wise. I will agree to that command.” And we're going to pause right there for a moment. Just write down what resonated with you. To the audience, the young men sit in the circle by age, from youngest to oldest. That's just to provide a sense of order, because life is so chaotic. But it's also up to the oldest to look out for the youngest. You can't turn down a royal request. That is what resonated with me. Everyone is born with a purpose. That gift that you come with, that's your royal request. We really want you guys to start thinking about what is the gift that you came to this world with, and then putting yourself in an environment to have that gift nurtured. Let's go back to the myth. He wanted to learn. And do you know what? He chose weaving. They did get married, and they celebrated their marriage with great fanfare. And one day he asked her, “I really would like to know how the people of my village feel and think.” She said, “The best way for you to know that is that you need to walk in their shoes, and be disguised like an ordinary person.” And all of a sudden, the bottom fell out and they fell into a hole. They were deep in a pit, and the only thing they could do was gasp. Write down your darkest moment from last year at college. If you don't share it with the group, at least write it down, so you can look at it and kinda figure it out. You know that he who conceals his disease cannot expect to be cured so when one of us is going through something tough, if we share it with others, then our sacrifices won't be in vain. Marlon. First semester I was at Central State, making the dean's list. I had all the success I could have as a first-semester college student. Then I made a bigger jump going to Kent State. I mean, I knew I was going to be ineligible for spring ball, but then finding out I was ineligible for fall was kinda devastating. Doing something that I been doing for like the past twelve years that I love, to sit out for a year, that shit hurt so bad. I grind hard. I grind hard, man. I want to get back on that field. That's why it's tough. So there's a quote, “When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, do you want to be successful?” I always tell myself bad as you want to breathe. All right. Thanks, Marlon. For people who don't know Marlon, Marlon and Chevin have been football stars since they were young, and were you All-State, Marlon? I remember in sixth grade and I really wanted Marlon to get in Alchemy. I knew he was a leader, so really appreciate that, Marlon. And you know the souls would have no rainbow had the eyes no tears. I love those tears, man. Imani. Going back to Case and having to readjust a lot to how the white kids act up there, I handled the extremities of not saying shit to them and then... getting in their face about it really poorly. There were a couple of times I threatened a kid. I took it real far a couple of times, and other times I wouldn't say anything and sit there and let them just act how they acted. I appreciate you sharing that. Write this quote down. If there is no enemy within, no enemy from without can harm you. That's that knowledge of self-peace, and that's where we tell you guys the importance of reading. The year went on. I started to realize that I'm going to have to do this myself. No one's here to light a fire underneath my butt anymore. Second semester's been a lot better in some aspects. My grades are looking better. Case is starting to grow on me. I'm on the pre-law track, still majoring in psych. I've met some good new friends, too. I distinctly remember my junior year of high school, my AP biology teacher, she just randomly blew up one day and she said I don't even act Black. WOW! And when I extrapolate it, it always comes down to Black people are never viewed as intelligent people, and if you speak articulately... You're acting white. The worst thing you can do is follow the stereotype. I got angry the one time, and I hate to even say this, but I threatened the kid. The room got quiet, and then I went too far, I told you, I threatened him with a knife. When it came out, I was like, all right, I was wrong. I was kinda joking, but I was kinda serious. I could've beat the kid up without the knife. It wasn't just one racist joke. It was built-up stuff, and I was pissed at this point. So I just blew up on him, like, “Dude, keep talking, I'm going beat the crap out of you.” And then for some reason, I was like, “Dude, I'll pull a knife on you if you keep talking.” I took it too far, and it was weird. I tried to immediately change the topic, but like you said, that's filling out the stereotype, and you want to try to never get that far when you're trying to teach somebody. I have white people asking me all the time, “Why can't I use the n-word?” I'm like, “I shouldn't need an explanation for this. You just can't.” The history behind the word. If I feel I shouldn't need to use it, you definitely should not need to use it. Another quote. “You find out what any man will quietly submit to, and you have found out the exact measure of injustice that will be opposed upon him. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by those of whom they oppress.” You always want to look long-term. You always want to ask yourself, what is my objective? Keep in mind what you're in school for. You guys are in school to get a degree. Always just think about long-term, man, the big picture. All right, go ahead, Chevin. After losing Ebony and my granddad, that was the third worst time lever had in my life. You sign a letter of intent. They tell you what you want to hear as a Division I player. “You're going to come in, you going to play. We got this for you, we got that for you.” Shoot. I'm going to keep it all real with you, but it ain't what you think it is, because half of the motherfuckers don't go to class. Half of the motherfuckers don't care. Half of them got two, three kids. I was around fathers. It wasn't football anymore. It was more about, man, let me get this money, period. Coaches are the same way. Just everybody gets so caught up in Division I. Shit, I'm more than an athlete. I mean, football's just something I'm good at. If you meet any college athlete, ask him just out the blue, “If football stopped, what would you do?” Ask half my teammates, they'd be like, “Man, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.” But they're already thinking we're niggers anyway, because there's a lot of racism there. People don't know about that. That college fresh shit? Yeah. A couple of us got jumped up there. I was ready to walk out, but I can't do that, because that's too common in Akron. You don't get a college experience. Only thing you see is your teammates. I'm not saying I can't go to the League, but let's look at the statistics. I mean, it's a small amount that go. The way they look at you is just sickening. Man, this ain't right. This ain't- no, I won't, man. I got some stuff to say, dog. This ain't right, man. Go ahead. You have no respect on that campus, man. They look at you at you as a dumb-ass jock. Just because that shit's paid for, man, doesn't mean everything's all good. We took some stuff in our lives just to try to get in a position of stability and so on. If you go through a bunch a shit just to acquire that certification or that degree, you will be a bitter-ass professional. It just goes with the territory. I suppressed a lot of the Chevin shit, the Marlon shit that I went through, so, in turn, if we can help you get there, we will all be the better for it, man. It's important for us to identify our wounds, because if we don't identify it, we're going to continue to wound others. And I don't know if you all noticed it, but I'm normally the one that's cussing, But everybody else is cussing. I haven't said a cuss word yet. I think that's maturity. The day is young! Milous is always in contact with you guys, so if you don't feel comfortable coming to me, you got Kwame, you got Andre, you got Milous. Just like in the myth, he's down in that pit. You've got to let us know, man. I can remember it very, very well. We were both sitting downstairs that night before he passed away, and we were just talking for hours. Then he went to sleep, and he said, “I love you.” And I heard this thumping sound. I didn't know what it was because it was raining that night, so I'm thinking it was the thunder. Thought I'll just go check on my father because usually he have seizures. When I walked into the room, he was on the ground. I couldn't pick him up at all. By the time I got him on the bed, I was very, very tired, and I rolled him over and I looked and I saw that he passed away. And that's the last thing I remember about my father. My father and I did everything together. On Saturday mornings, we'd go to Burger King breakfast, and then we'd always go wash the car. I thank God that he gave me that time with him before he passed away. I've basically been the male role in my house, so it's just been me and my mother. This will be a good year, though. Yeah. I was proud of you last year. I'm proud of you all the time. Now that your dad has passed, it's just me and you. I've got to thank Kwame and them, because they've been a champion for you. Yeah, he was always there. Basketball is a good tool for me, too, just to really keep me out of trouble. I still want to be a physical therapist, though. This semester I've realized that the way we carry ourselves is different. Being a Black male, we're seen differently by the world. It puts this weight on your shoulders that makes you strive for excellence. The thing I fear the most is the opportunities that I'm missing out on, and the places that I could be. How are your grades? They're fine. They're not as well as they are last semester. I think I'll probably finish with like a 3.0 this semester. Just kinda going through a few little things. I lost my focus. But I'm working on it, trying to finish strong. And whatever you do, don't get sidetracked. Make sure you really study. I mean, study. Yeah. Just being in college, kicking it, partying, all that stuff, it's just hard to find balance. The Greek word metron, or the median, moderation. The myth of the Bacchae. Dionysus ends up tricking the king into dressing as a woman and partaking in ecstasy. The other women think the king is a lion, and they rip him apart. I really like that myth. It shows the lesson of moderation. It's what life is about, the threshold in between two opposites and kinda finding that metron. School would be so much easier if I didn't have to work. My mom's been working at Akron Children's Hospital since about 2004, which was helpful when a cashier position opened in the cafeteria. About twenty-four to thirty-two hours a week. It's really exhausting with sixteen credit hours. C.J. My darkest moment was going to jail. I mean, it just made me realize what I took for granted. It almost makes you go crazy, for real. Ain't no more seeing your homies. Ain't no nothing. It kinda makes you study yourself. How long were you in jail, man? Only for two weeks. And then what are your plans after that? College. I mean, I've been applying to colleges for a while now. They've been sounding good over the phone, so I'm just going to try to follow into it. Okay. All right, thanks. Darius. I had a couple of experiences where I just, I got this hate and this anger for white men, because I came home and one of the first things, I was rolling in the car with Reese, and this car full of white boys yelled, “Nigger!” to me out the car like it was a fucking game show. And I told him, either he had a death wish or he was running an experiment on how fast a Black man would turn his car around when angry. I'm faced with that a lot. You say something racist and it sounds okay, so I'm confused. Is this okay or am I tripping? It's hard not to generalize and just say fuck them all, and be safe. Thanks. I had no idea, here again, that you guys were dealing with the anger that you have in certain situations. Write this quote down. You can have people of your kind who are not your color, and those of your color who are not your kind. You just always want to keep an open mind, man. Thanks, Darius. Be careful, brother, okay? Be careful, man. You've lived in your little environment, and its been cool and things have worked out. When you see the bigger world issues, I know it may be shocking at times, and you may personally feel wounded, but there are some tough, strong issues, and many of them can be vicious and violent towards you, but you've got to know that that's out there, so when you go out, it don't take you for a loop. Really work on yourself. Good job, brothers. Myths are not just for putting children to sleep, but for waking adults up, so while we're doing the myths, it's not just for the youth. It's for waking us up, too. The first semester, I had struggled to step outside my dorm. Second semester, I barely was in my dorm. It's been about growth and coming into myself, being comfortable, being who I am around other people, even though they're not like me. The most difficult thing was the racism I've encountered. I work Pizza Hut Fridays and Saturdays, and Acme throughout the week in produce. So it's my first day and they had me doing bananas, and my manager comes over, he's like, “Oh, they have the Black guy doing' bananas. isn't that funny?” I didn't even get it at first. I'm like, that - oh. And looking back, I should've said, “No, I don't get it.” Now instead of just saying I don't know or nodding my head, I'll just be like, “I don't know. Could you explain that to me?” I'll make you say it out loud, so you can see how racist you're being. It's made me upset. It's like I'm facing all this energy from white males. I don't understand why. So I just have to prepare myself and keep it in my mind what to do in those situations. Alchemy, one, it gave me the outlet of drumming, and I wouldn't have found another outlet for anger, for love, for anything. And it influenced my poetry, because it opened my imagination. Alchemy showed me, you can take a lemon and a skyscraper and make them relate somehow, and make it connected, because you have all these crazy myths and how they relate to real life. I can say what happened to me in thousands of different ways. We are taught from birth that we will automatically inherit the very things we hate most about our parents. My father has a face like a gorge carved into the side of a mountain desert canyon, sliced into his facial expressions for every storm he's weathered. My father is the most determined person I have ever crossed paths with. He put his future on hold, so his hands would be free to hold his three children, I still catch myself trying to find a red and blue jumpsuit under his clothes. I still catch myself trying to walk into the house the way he did after a long day at work, Wings worn out but still flapping, chest outstretched like I'm bouncing a crown on my pecs And a face hard enough to crack the sound barrier. My father is the reason I think I can still fly sometimes. There once was a boy right around your age. He was a being of many abilities. Having been fed the white snake as a child, he could speak the languages of the animals as well as humans. There was a temple at the top of the mountain his village was the base of. The sage told him to go up the path given, that there will always be help for him. My dad's working now. My mother, as well, is working, my sisters are doing really well in school, and so it's taken off that mental stress of worrying. You're about to be a seventh grader. I know. - You're getting old. I'm extremely close with my mother and my sisters. Leaving them, I didn't know if they were going to be all right. This semester, I went home maybe twice, and seeing how well they're doing has really helped me out a lot. My girlfriend used to have a python. Big one? Mm-hmm, it was bigger than this. My uncle had a boa constrictor. Can I see it? My goals haven't changed much. I still want to try and develop some type of programs for after schools. Can you see his eye, like the cracks and stuff on it? That's his skin about to shed. That white stuff on top of his eye's the skin. I see how much it did for me when I was a kid, so I want to try and place a program for kids to actually have that outlet for their creative side. I know this is your first time really drumming together. So let's keep it coming, one beat, one sound. Base, clap, tone. Base, clap, tone. Base, clap, tone. The name of the myth today is The Hunter and the Boa Constrictor. You ready to go on that journey? Once upon a time, there was this old man, very old man, and he was a hunter. And you know what? He was very poor. He would check his traps daily, but he never caught anything. And when he went to that last trap, he looked inside that trap, there was a big boa constrictor. Getting ready to kill that boa constrictor, and the boa constrictor pleaded, “Dear hunter, if you do not kill me, I will make you the richest man on earth.” I want you to write down what would you do. Would you kill the boa constrictor now and eat now? Or would you trust that boa constrictor and just wait to see what would happen in the future? Okay, now keep in mind, you're hungry. You've got a decision to make, so I want to know what you're going to do and I want to know why. Okay, Darren, what are you going to do? I would not kill the boa, because I will sacrifice to take the money, and I will trust the snake. Ajante, what are you going to do and why? I would just wait to be rich beyond his wildest dreams, because I might get lucky and catch a bunny or something. Marcellus, what are you going to do? I would trust the boa constrictor because he would make more money to buy some food than eating it now, and getting less money selling the skin. Zethron. I said I would kill him and sell his skin and eat him, because, well, I'm hungry, so I've got to eat or I'm going to freak out. For the majority of urban youth, we're always going for what we can get right now. You want to start making sacrifices for longer down the road, so you want to start doing your homework in the classroom, making your sacrifices right now. You ready, man? You sure you're ready? Positive? All right, we're going to see! I'm going to be interning for the City of Akron's Mayor Office, and I'm going to be learning how every department works. You joked the other day, you said, “Well, when you learn how the city works, you be sure to let me know. I mean, every day's a new deal, every day's a new problem. You've got to balance what's good for everybody or for the majority. It's tough. If you continue what you're doing, from what I've seen in a short period of time, if you continue doing that, one day, you'll be in one of these seats if you decide to run for a political office, because you won't have any trouble addressing people on the floor or in the community. Thank you. Reflecting excellence is important to me because where we come from, people like us aren't excellent. I feel like I have to overcompensate for what society expects out of me. I feel that my dress, my attire, my speech, my conversation, my etiquette, my awareness of the world, everything has to be up to par. Just really trying to figure out whether or not I should try to serve myself, or to try to continue on this academic journey in which I can serve others. It's the contradiction that I'm struggling with right now. Just so many people in the world that need to be helped. As I need help, and as I needed help. How can we really show people that we are the heroes? I don't know what my role is. I don't know exactly what it is that I need to be doing, what I should be doing, but I know what I must do. I must do something, which helps people. My dad is one of the main people in my life that supports me and helps me. My biggest worry with you and Tab was that if you guys could get into your junior year, once you reach that point, it becomes a little bit easier. I think your sophomore year is really your hardest year, academically, at least from my experience. We'll see what happens. Thinking about dropping out, becoming a stripper. Stripper works. It'll be delicious. Do a reality show, male stripper. This is your own idea of being creative, so you'll be a trailblazer. Go into random grocery stores. I'll see you in the headlines. “Promising Young Eastern Michigan University Student Arrested.” Oh, no, it would not be like that! “Naked Black Guy Taken in Grocery Store.” They would not say all that prestige. I felt good when I saw my dad. It wasn't like I made a little joke, he made a little joke. It was like when I challenged him, he challenged back a little bit and it was good, and I felt good. People make excuses for things they can't accomplish, they can't finish school, they can't get a job, whatever hurdles they allow to keep them immobilized. Ok, here's what there's enough of. There's enough people saying take responsibility. It's a lot tougher to identify and say this is what happened back then, this is what's happening now, this is going to happen in the future if we don't change something, this is how we change it, this is what we do to move forward. You can choose to do something. You can choose to accept it. Or you can choose to do nothing. What stopped me from finishing my engineering degree? What stopped me from staying married? What stopped me from doing the things that I wanted to do with my kids, and having them all be on scholarship or having myself in a position where I could pay for them to go to school? He doesn't really have the capacity to help. He wishes he could, and I appreciated that, hearing that that desire was in him so deeply. I was talking to my grandma yesterday, and she told me my dad always talks about how proud he is of me to her, and I was surprised, because he doesn't say that to me. I'm the president of the poetry society, so that was a good thing that happened this year. I am poetry. I'll never stop writing. It's my life. My girlfriend told me that I was just like my father, I didn't think about the way that I crack my neck thirteen times whenever I drive because he did so flawlessly. I thought about how the sound of rumbling upstairs still gives me chills because that was always the start to fights. I thought about how I watched my mother dragged naked from her bedroom like she didn't belong, and I thought about how I felt like I didn't belong in my own home because I could do nothing to help her. I thought about how my brother and father haven't spoken in five years. I once witnessed him pull over to the side of the highway like he was responsible for the car crash we had just passed. He did everything in his power to pull the women from the car, When she told me I was just like my father, I just smiled and said, “Baby, you have no idea.” And that's my poem. Wow. That is so deep. That is so profound. I love that. And I think that's what I love about your poetry, there's so much truth in it, it's so real. And you feel it, and you spit it like you feel it. And it's come full circle for you. When I look at you, I am so proud of you. You learned how to fly, and hopefully those experiences will help teach other kids that are going through stuff. You saw the bad, but you also saw the good. You're going to be a heck of a man one day. And I just hope I live to see it. Feeling like a fish out of water. We want our college youth to start working with sixth graders. One of the things we need them to do is Carry on the tradition! Carry on the tradition, so we want them to learn how to play the drum and tell the myth, so we're going to be their captive audience. They just did this an hour ago, so they've only been working on it an hour. Once upon a time, there was a boy, a prince, rather. One day... He felt the need to mentor the young males of his village, and he went far, and brought back something mystical. And so a circle was formed, like the one we're sitting in now. Let's keep the circle going. You all really did good, so you're all like the next Kwames and Shelton, but younger and more different. How about what resonated with the college boys? Okay, that's cool. You guys already understand that your life is a myth and a journey and you understand that you can become heroes and that really was powerful to me. Life is really not a myth. Life is like not fiction, it's like real life. It's all real. A common theme in myth is a common theme in life. You know what I'm saying? There's always a hero, and the hero always has to leave his home to go learn more about himself, to his home to apply what he learned to his life. Even now, you guys are living a myth during the school year. You have to leave home, go to school, learn new things, come back home and apply it to your own life. When I was your age, I didn't really see it, but over the course of maybe a year, I saw my life from a whole new perspective, you know? I looked at everything as a new challenge, as a story. I saw myself trying to better myself in my own story, because no one else is going to live your story but you. If you look at who you're mimicking, the behavior that you do, where did it come from? Was that a story told to you, or something that you saw? And if you saw it, where did they get it from? So often, we try to tell you the story that will successfully get you through it. The stuff that you may be mimicking, will that really get you through? You probably don't know. But we know the end of these stories, so we say that when you become the writer of your story, know what the end will be. You get it, fellas? So watch the joke and the trickster out there. In every myth, is there someone trying to trap someone? Is there a trap everywhere? Yes. You think that's in real life'? - Yeah. All right. Think about it. To hear you guys say the things that you said, it just shows that you were listening. The college youth, once they learned the myths, they were ready to go. People said this couldn't be duplicated and it's just showing how simple it is to be duplicated. Took them an hour, so that's what resonated with me. You know what's funny? That you all passed it on to them and they passed it on to us. Generation to generation. My dream is to change the world, for my words to be heard around the world, to change the world, period. Come on! Come on!
