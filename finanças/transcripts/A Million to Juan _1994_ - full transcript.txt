(slow trumpet music) (upbeat Latin dance music) [Alejandro] That's my dad, Juan Lopez. And he's always saying funny things like "I never met an odd job that didn't like me." Or "If variety is the spice of life, I'm over seasoned." He says he's going for the Guinness Book of Records for the most jobs done by one man in a lifetime. My Uncle Jorge bet me a pizza that he'd never make it, but the way dad's going I'll be stretching cheese in no time. That's me, Alejandro Lopez, and I'm almost 10 years old, and an artist. And that's Patricia, my friend. And that's her mom, Mrs. Gonzales, who's a really great expert on angels and saints. Every day between 2:30 and sunset I come here with Patricia after school until my dad picks me up. Well, I can feel the sun starting to go, so he should be getting on a bus just about... now. This is my favorite time of the day with him. You see, my dad's not a morning person. He says that if man was meant to get up early, then God wouldn't have had to create coffee. I think it's just that morning is the time when he misses Mom the most. You see, she had to go to heaven about three years ago. Just then, Grandma Tita had this incredible dream of my dad and me living in some smokey place surrounded by angels. So of course, we moved here to Los Angeles, but so far the only angels we've discovered are in Anaheim. And I'm a Dodger fan. I thought it was Jenkins. He's supposed to bring me a plumber to fix my sink. Yeah, well you'd have better luck waiting for Elvis to show up. Hey Papi. Hi Mijo. Have you seen his latest? Look at that, it looks exactly like Patricia. God has blessed your son with the hands of a great artist. Beautiful, Mijo. You're home from work. [Alejandro] She didn't go to work today. She's sick again. (Patricia coughs) You are making her sit right here by the window? Patricia, you should be in bed. No, I'm feeling much better now. It's freezing in here. [Mrs. Gonzales] Jenkins hasn't fixed the heater, yet. And I've been after him for over a month but he doesn't listen to me. Here, put this on. Mrs. Gonzales, I feel so bad about the money I owe you, because I know if you had it you could fix the heater yourself. Don't worry about that. But I'm gonna talk to Jenkins. I'm gonna make sure he fixes everything. And I'll pay just as soon as I can, eh? I already told you, it's not good to worry about money. That's why we have the saints, and they don't like it when we don't trust 'em. (speaks in foreign language) Let me see here, which is the one that's good for money troubles? Hold this. (mutters in foreign language) Here, drink this. What is it? Don't ask. (speaks in foreign language) Okay, and a little bit of Santa Barbara spray. (Juan coughs) Yeah, that'll do it. (speaks in foreign language) Yeah, it's outta my hands. [Alejandro] That's Anita, my dad's new girlfriend. Hi. [Alejandro] I hope she's not gonna be my new mom. 'Cause I'm okay with just having two uncles instead. Uncle Jorge, who likes to carve, and Uncle Alvaro, who likes to garden. And they both love novellas, you know, the Spanish soaps. (foreign language plays over television) (Jorge and Alvaro cry) Anyways, that's just about everybody who's anybody. Except for a few surprises, and this story about how oranges changed our lives forever. (Juan laughs) Come out here Aladdin! You better rub your lamp, you're running out of Budweiser, and you know that's my favorite brew. Thank you, dear fellow. Boy look out, we says you got your brew. And I really appreciate the artwork on my wall outside. Lopez, Alejandro, what do you need today? Well, just the usual. Dad, don't forget my liquorish. I don't know if I have enough, but alright then. Let's see. Rice, $1.25. Tortillas, 55 cents. Cumin, 49 cents. In India we use curry. And the reason we call it curry is because when you eat too much you have to curry, curry to the bathroom. And liquorish, 60 cents. For a grand total of $2.89. I got $1.60. Huh... Let me owe you a $1.29, I'll pay you tomorrow. (speaks in foreign language) No credit in any language. Don't even ask. Please? I'm a good customer, I'm here all the time. I'll pay you tomorrow. Don't you understand Spanish? This is not a charity, put something back. Have you no pride, as well? Don't you want to be a good example for Alejandro? Look at Alejandro. Come here, you're getting to be such a big and tall boy. Give me that. That leaves you short 69 cents. (Juan sighs) Well, how 'bout without the cumin? You're still short 20 cents. Here Dad, here's a quarter. (cash register rings) It's your lucky day. You get a nickel back. Thank you. It's alright Dad. I didn't need that anyway. It's bad for my teeth. I'll tell you what you cannot learn. Papi, these beans are a lot better than Mrs Mackensen's. Juan, you should get a job as a cook somewhere. I tried. Jobs like that are hard to come by. Can't even get work at the street corner anymore. Every day is like the United Nations; one more country more desperate than we are. And if you ask for a little more, nobody hires you. Well it's better than carrying cement bags for three dollars a day in Mexico. Sure, we make more money here, but it costs more to live. [Alvaro] So what's the difference? At least Mexico is beautiful. Life was simple. When we were in Mexico all you did was complain. I should never have listened to you. "Come to America, heaven on Earth." Hah, become Hell to me. As soon as I get some feria I'm going back. Well you send us a postcard. (Jorge burps) (Alejandro laughs) Come on, Jorge. How's my son ever gonna learn manners with you around? You know, in some countries it's good manners to burp after you eat. It shows the cook that you like the meal. In this country it's bad manners, matano. Anyone want some more coffee? I'll have some. But change that sock. You've had that sock in there for three weeks now. That coffee's starting to taste like my shoes. You think so? (door squeaks) It's that time of the month again, muchachos! El rent-o es due-o. Hmhm. Time to pay-o el piper-o. What's this? Poor food. I love poor food. Want some coffee? No. Patron, we keep paying the rent but you don't fix our toilet. It's been backed up for four months. Jorge, Jorge. Go get the money from the can. Mr. Jenkins, um, our toilet has been broken for four months. When do you suppose you can fix it? What are you? Some kind of a one man complaint department? No. Come on, you're living in a palace compared to the way you people usually live. Here. [Jenkins] That kid gets one inch taller, he starts paying rent. Anybody taller than me, they pay rent. Sobaco. He takes advantage of us because he knows we can't complain to nobody. Well, that was the last of my money. If I don't get a job I don't know what I'm gonna do. Mr. Jenkins is gonna throw us out. You can always selling oranges for Hector Delgado again. I wouldn't work selling oranges for Hector Delgado if it was the last job on earth. [Mrs. Delgado] You have to increase their productivity. You're not managing them correctly. Why? Why do I keep seeing oranges instead of money at the end of the day? (speaks in foreign language) Why? He hasn't sold a single bag today. And who's fault is that? That's your fault. No. (speaks in foreign language) They don't know how to speak English. They don't know, they have never been in this country. It's all your fault. How do you think we're gonna pay the rent? Do, do, do something. No. If you want to remain a representative of Delgado Oranges, you better start selling. Everything's dying out here. Well, it's still early. Maybe business will pick up. Well it better be, for your sake. Because, you know, Anita's been complaining that you haven't been taking her out anymore. When did you see Anita? Last night. At the bar with her cousin Hermona. Man, she told me she was home sick. Sick and tired, probably. You know a beautiful woman like Anita... She might start looking for a man who can give her what she really needs. (Hector laughs) Hector! (horn blows) I haven't got all day! Hurry up! We got eight more people to see! [Hector] (speaks in foreign language) [Mrs. Delgado] (speaks in foreign language) Oranges! (choir music) (car radio plays rock music) You people recycle these, don't you? (can being crushed) Hey Juan! You sellin' them oranges, huh? Hey! Shell Shock! You're a little late today, huh? Ey, you don't learn, huh? Oranges. Watch and learn and I'll show you how to do this thing, brother. (Shell Shock chuckles) Oranges good. Good. You ain't gonna make a million dollars with oranges. Watch and learn raza brother, you about to get skill. Hey ah, ain't you kinda young to... Desert Storm, Vietnam, it's all the same, brother. Mercy on the wounded. [Woman in Car] Oh, poor thing. Here. Here, here you go. Think you got it? [Shell Shock] Thank you, thank you. Bless you. [Woman in Car] Oh, God bless you. Take care. [Shell Shock] Thank you very much for a thank you. What a fox. (Shell Shock makes kissing noise) - Somalia! - Oranges! Somalia! Victim of friendly fire! Victim of friendly fire. Oh thank you, thank you. Bless you, bless you. Hello ladies. I'm an old victim, yes. Aw. Thank you, thank you. (women giggling) God bless you. [Women] Bye! (women giggling) Keep America free! America number one, number one! [Women] Bye. You'll never learn. Hey, huh, don't you feel guilty fooling people like that? There's two kinds of people, fool: the ones doin' the right thing, and the ones who win doin' their own thing. Yup! I guess it's time for sushi! (Shell Shock laughs) Hey, big party tonight. Yeah, them liquor girls are wild. (Shell Shock laughs) Well, you have a good day, man. See you later, Juan. Oranges, good! (Shell Shock laughs) You know, when I started out I used to sell 200 bags a day, minimum. He hasn't sold a single bag today. Have you, Juan? Hey Anita, what are you doing in that truck with him? Hector's taking me for a ride. If you had a car I would've asked you. But you don't. And at the rate you're selling oranges, in about 20 years you might be able to buy a bicycle. (Hector laughs) (Anita chuckles) Comin' over tonight? I thought maybe Alejandro, and you and I could run out and get a bite to eat. I am supposed to be going out with you, Juan, not Alejandro. See what I mean? All he cares about is Alejandro, Alejandro. Hector Delgado always puts the woman first. I put her on a pedestal like a goddess. And when she comes down from that pedestal, she's down, on the ground, with me. Get outta that truck. Do you see a diamond ring on my finger? A wedding band? No. I don't think so. You know, Juan, you can't boss me around. No, I can do what I please. Maybe I'll come see you after we get back from our ride. Ready to go, Hector? I'm getting bored. (car starts) (Hector laughs) [Hector] Goodbye. (Anita laughs) (choir music) Oranges? Oranges?! (upbeat Latin music) Double your money. Juan! Stop by this, stop by this. Come on, now. Find the king, find the king, dog. Come on, find the king. Give me a bid. I bid some feria. Not today! Aw! Mister white man! Find the king, find the king, find the running king. Give me a bidding! (hammering) Aye! What happened to you? Long story. But, I made some money. Count that for me. Well that's good, because Alvaro and I didn't work again, today. Hey, did Anita call? No, but uh, Se?orita Smith did. What'd she say? She wants you to go to the immigration office Monday at 10:00 am. It's about your amnesty. 62 dollars. Maybe things are looking up. Maybe it's approved. What are you carving? I don't know. I'll tell you when I'm finished. [Juan] We gotta eat out more often. [Jorge] Boy that steak was good. I'm glad somebody's making money. One thing's for sure, Jorge, you didn't. Excuse me, but did you bring in any money today? Well, at least I helped Mrs. Gonzales run some errands. Big deal. Hey, will you two stop it? You're like sisters. At least you had a normal day. Today I lost my girlfriend on the day I sold the most oranges ever. Hey, you see? One door closes, another one opens. But a real strange thing did happen. This guy in a limousine drives up, right? I walk up to him like I'm gonna sell oranges, and I don't sell no oranges. He opens the window, it rolls down, and he gives me this envelope. Eh. Maybe it's a warrant or an eviction notice. Huh. It's a check. With my name on it. Hmm, look at all the zeros. We're used to zeros. How many? How many zeros in a million? Four? Six. It's a million. How many L's in a million? Four? Two. Give me that. Gotta be a fake. Yeah. It looks like the ones you get in the junk mail. I got one of these from that Looking for Stars guy, and then I tried to cash it, and they try to sell me an encyclopedia. Yeah you're right. Some dude just playing a joke. Hey, look. There's a note in here. Mijo. Read this for Daddy, my eyes' burnt. Okay. Dear Juan Lopez, Enclosed you will find a sum of money. It is loaned to you for 30 days without interest to use anyway you want. In 30 days exactly, report to the same corner where we met and return the check. This is an experiment. If it is successful, and you've proved yourself worthy, you shall be given a gift. An experiment? Yeah. They want to see how stupid you are. Sounds spooky. It sure looks real. I'd buy myself the most incredible bike in the entire world. I'd get a farm, and grow vegetables and flowers. I'd start my own business. I'd get some nice threads, a new car, and a pair of (speaks in foreign language). (laughter) (mariachi music) [Olivia] Juan, I don't think you have any choice. You want me to take my son to a country he's never even been to? No, I don't even want you to leave. That's why I tried this amnesty angle, because I thought, with all your complications... Se?or Lopez. What complications? I've explained to you, I was born here. I was born in a strawberry field... Outside of Bakersfield. Yes. And when my mother died... I know, when you were six years old... I went to Mexico. To live with your grandmother... And when she died... I know, you came back here. I know. You know! I know, I know. I know you know! They don't know. They need documentation. There are three other options that you have, though. If you find a job your uniquely qualified for, or if you start a significant business yourself, or if you marry an American citizen. All the American citizens I know are illegal. I'm not uniquely qualified for anything. Start a significant business with what? With this? What's this? Where did you get this? I was selling oranges off the corner and some big limousine came by, rolled down the window, and handed me that. It's a million dollar check. I know. If it's real I'll buy you lunch. There's a note here. Did you read the note? I don't understand this. It says you can use this for a month, then you have to give it back. What does it mean? I don't know. How can you use a check you can't cash? Well, anyway, it's probably not real, you know? But, take it to the bank. Well I called the bank, but they said they couldn't verify over the phone. That I had to go in there in person. Have you ever been in trouble with the law? The law?! Shhh. (crowd panicking) No. I had a parking ticket once. Right. So, go into the bank and see if it's real. Think you'd better keep your options open. Okay. Well, thank you. But, if it is real you owe me lunch. If it's real I'll cook you lunch. Thanks. It went bad, huh? It went good. No it didn't go good, I can tell. Everything's gonna be alright. No it's not. What are you guys doing here? We wanted to see how you made out. Well they denied my green card. See, I told you. I was right. Look, just do me a favor and don't tell Alejandro, huh? This is terrible. Gotta be rich to get a green card. You know, Jorge, you're right. That's why we should go straight to the bank. With what, Alvaro? With this? Well it looks real to me. Come on, it's a phony. [Alvaro] One door closes and another one opens. Let's go to the bank. It's a million dollars. (upbeat Latin music) (Richard makes car noises) Hi. Huh, I'm Juan Lopez. I called about the check. (Richard makes car noises) [Margo] Huh, Mr. Dickerson, I have a Mr Juan... Margo, I told you to never bother me when I'm in conference. Yeah, I know sir, but sir, please, um, it's check number 131138. Oh well, then. (Richard clears throat) Please, send him in. This way, Gentlemen. Mr. Dickerson will see you now. Gentlemen. Please, have a seat. Make yourselves at home. - Gracias. - Gracias. Gracias. Mi casa is su casa. [Brothers] Gracias. You care for anything? Coffee, cocktails, do lunch? Whatchu got? Well what do you want? Coffee? Coffee. Coffee. Sex on the beach with a burrito. Hey! What? It's a drink. I saw it on TV. Margo, um, two caf? au lait's, sex on the beach, and a burrito. (Richard chuckles) Yes Mr. Dickerson. Now which one of you has the funds? I have fun. We all have fun. Yeah, we have a lot of fun. Well I'm very happy for you, but, huh, who has the mula? The cashola? El coin-o. The check. - Juan. - Juan. Oh. Well. We can invest in, uh, six month high-yield CD's, FDIC guarantees, long term loans, spread-risk portfolios. Is that English? So, Mr. Lopez, how would you like me to invest your million dollars, hm? I'm not sure. Tell him you'll think about it. I'll think about it. No, of course. Think about it, but I promise you that no other banker will take care of you the way I will. Now think of me as your compadre, okay? Now here is my office number, voicemail number, huh... 1700 fax and pager number, and just in case, my mother's number, okay? Now call me at any time. We never sleep. Well, thank you. Let's go. Listen, I'm having a couple of friends over for a cocktail party at my home next weekend, and I'd love you to come. Now trust me on this one, Mr. Lopez, high rollers, great networking. Nancy, would you put him on the guest list please? I thank you, Mr. Dickerson. Ah, Dick. I'm Dick to my friends. Hm? And I've always had this affinity for Spain, you know, Cardona, the bulls, Goya, The Naked Maja. (dramatic strings) (upbeat mariachi music) Look at this. Oh this is pretty. Come here, Alvaro. Look at that. Lifestyles of the rich and Chicano. Hey, hey. Ricardo Montalb?n. The plane, the plane. (Jorge laughs) This. Marouflage. Just like Jimmy's car. That looks good. Please stop handling the merchandise. Aren't we allowed to touch the things we're gonna buy? Customers are, but it's obvious you're not gonna buy anything, so please leave. What's your problem? If he did decide to buy something you couldn't make change. [Klaus] Oh is that right? Will this be enough, sir? (Klaus laughs) [Fabio] Klaus! Yes. What seems to be the problem? Well, sir, we have these three day laborers that are trying to pass this bogus check... Have we verified this check? No sir. Would be a simple matter to verify this check. You boys don't mind if I verify this, do you? [Juan] Call Mr. huh... Uh, Dickerson. Yeah, Mr. Dickerson. Yes, thank you. I know his... Hello. Yeah, Rick Dickerson, please. Dick. He's a friend. Yeah, Rick, yeah. Sorry to get you out of a meeting, yeah. Listen, do you have any checks missing? Yeah, we've got three Latinos here with a check drawn on your bank for one million dol... Yes, Juan Lopez. Yeah, well... Yes, that's your signature. Yes, I'm sorry. We'll speak about it later. Yes, thank you. Klaus. Are you out of your mind? Is this the way you treat customers like Mr. Lopez? Mr. Lopez, please, forgive me. My name is Fabio Fabiani. This is my shop. Please excuse my assistant. Bald Caucasians with pony tails. Please! Huh, Klaus, get these gentlemen some cappuccinos. Some wine. Some white wine, please. We've got some beautiful fabric... Uh, Klaus. Not too white.

Hey Chewy, Chewy. Mike, Tony, Enrique. Take care of the car for him, eh? Don't let nothin' happen to it. Hey, what are you doin' in there? You gonna sleep there, or what? (dogs barking) Boy, I shoulda never got that car. You know that money isn't mine to keep. Relax, Primo. Whoever gave you that check promised you a gift, right? Ask him for the car. I want a bike. Minute I get a job, I'm gonna get you a bike. In the meantime, hurry up and go to bed. The toilet is broken again. Aw! Maybe we should open up a charge account at the hardware store and get a new one. Yeah! Are you guys listening to me? No more credit! No more charges! I gotta use that money properly. I'll tell you what, though. I'll call Jenkins and tell him to keep his promise to fix our toilet. - Right. - Right. Hey, didn't I tell you to go to bed? Andale! (slow orchestral music) (dogs barking) (Juan coughs) (Juan storing) (cheerful quartet music) [Family] Buenos dias! Your favorite breakfast: huevos con chorizo. And your favorite newspaper, The National Inquirer. That's very nice, but, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go to work? What work? We're rich now. I already told you, we're not rich. That money isn't mine. Does this mean I have to go to school today? Yes, young man, you have to go to school today. Well, can you at least give us a ride? Yeah. (Juan yawns) I could do that. [Jorge] Don't go out of your way. "Woman gives birth to herself"? Gotta see that. [Alvaro] What do we gotta go to work for? [Jorge] Yeah, we got the check. We need money. We don't even have gas. Gas, I'll give you some gas. [Alvaro] We know, we know. [Jorge] What are you wearing a suite for? [Juan] 'Cause I'm gonna go see Ms. Smith, and I don't want to be looking like a bum, alright? [Jorge] So we're bums? [Juan] No, you know what I mean. Buenos dias. [Friends] Beunos dias. [Juan] Gracias, gracias. [Jorge] (speaks in foreign language) Go home. (cars passing) (mariachi music) [Jorge] Now we're gonna be done at five, so come back and pick us up. Don't be late. Five o'clock! (speaks in foreign language) Roller!

Oh, nice belt! Bam! Oh my god, silk socks! Bam! This is dope, dog, you livin' fat, you livin'... Flaco, I'm on the phone right now. Hello? No speak English. Hey, what're you doin'? Shh.

Nah, no way. Whoa, hold up. That's not even the best part of it. You don't have to put up any money, dog. You don't have to put up any money! All you gotta do is give me the name of the winner, dog. Right there. Give me today's horse, dog. I don't know anything about that. No way, no way. What do you mean no way, man? Just give me the name of the horse. Hey Flaco, I said no way. I'm busy. What you mean no way, dog? I'm your friend, give it up! Give up the horse. No way. Why you gotta dis me like that, dog? I'm your boy, man. You gonna dis your boy like that? No way. Yeah. Sorry, I got disconnected. Uh, this is Juan Lopez for Ms. Smith please. No way. Oh she's busy? Okay, I'll wait. No Way on the fourth? No Way on the forth! 40 to 1, dog! I love you, man! We're gonna win, dog! This is the beginning. I'll give you the money later. Yeah, it's Mr. Flaco... I mean, it's Juan Lopez for Ms. Flaco... I mean, is Ms. Smith there? I know. I know, I know, I know. I know. I know, I know, I know. I know. Okay, I know. So anyway, so I'm in negotiations with Gary, right? The guy screwed me before, he's gonna try to screw me again. But I'm prepared for it. I'm confident. I look him right in the eye and I say "Forget it, okay? Forget it. I'm leaving. "Forget it." What I said to him. You actually said that? I didn't, I said, I just said, I said, okay, yeah, I said "If that's the way you're gonna treat me, "you know, I'm leaving." I said, "I'm not gonna take it." You said "forget it"? I didn't actually say... I didn't have to say anything, okay? He could see it in my eyes. Se?or Lopez! Because in Hector Delgado's vocabulary, there's only one word that doesn't exist. Giving up. When I see the mountain, it's not high enough. The valley's not low enough, and the river's not wide enough for me. Isn't that a song? This crap really gets on your nerves, doesn't it? No! I love mariachi music. Why? It's so romantic. Oh, it's monotonous. (Jeff hums) What's the matter with you? You've changed. You used to be so adventurous. I have a spirit of adventure. I just don't want to adventure in Mexico. Thank you, but how do you say no in Spanish? Couldn't just be no, could it? It's no, yeah. I am so thrilled that you came here, and you chose to come here. Please sit down. And I want to let you know, that mi casa, es su casa. The genius of my idea is in it's simplicity. Hector Delgado's oranges to go. Because this is a tourist trap. They come and they try to foist all this crap on you, okay? I just want to eat. Ew, gah. Refried beans. Yeah, how many times? We get the check, please? I got to get back to the office. The office? Isn't Wall Street closed on Saturdays? I got a ton of work to do for Monday. Paperwork. Come on, please. Can't we just stay a little longer to see the band? Oh, Christ. Here they come. See? Thank you. They've descended like locusts. Anita. Orange. I need an orange? I need an orange. I need an orange. Anita orange. Oh Hector, that's good. When I see you, and your big, juicy oranges. Billboards. Benches. Oh Hector, you're making me so thirsty. (slurping) I... Please, I... Please ask them to leave. I can't... (speaking in foreign language) I thought they were really good. They're terrible. Let's go. And mole? What is this? They name their food after some sort of blind rodent. Oh, I'm gonna eat that. Yeah, I'm anxious to eat that. Ow, I got beans on my phone! Se?or Lopez? Se?orita Smith. Hi. Oh, hi, this is my, um... This is Juan... Jeff. This is Juan. Se?or Lopez... This is my son, Alejandro. Oh, you're the great artist your father's been telling me all about. Mrs. Gonzales says I could be famous, just like my dad. Just like your father, huh? He's a celebrity. Well, ever since he got into the big bucks. What? Mrs. Smith, uh, would you and your friend like to join us? There's so much I gotta tell you. We'd love to, but we're in a hurry. No no, no no. I have to stay and hear this. This is important. Olivia, my work. This is my work. Don't worry, I'll take a cab. You can go, I'll meet you at home. Fine. - Fine. Okay. - Good, good. - Okay. Take a taxi. - Sure. You don't want to ride in the Mercedes, you want to take a taxi. Perfect. That's right. Typical. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Thanks, thanks, bye. So it was real? I think so. Oh my. Oh, but wait a minute. You can't spend it, right? I mean, you have to give it back in 30 days. Oh, I haven't spent it. I just show it to people. Show it to people? What do you mean? I show it to people and they give me things. What? Come here. Sit down. - So. - Alejandro, hi! Hi Monica! Is that your girlfriend? One of them. So people are giving you things? What kind of things? See what I mean? What else? Clothes, a car, things for the boy. Juan, you're gonna have to pay those back sometime. I mean, aren't you worried about that? Things have been happening so fast I haven't had time to worry. You just show them the check and they just give you things? That's so amazing. You know what? I bet you could... I bet you could use that check as collateral to start a business or something. I know some people that could help you. I'm so booked up next week. Are you free evenings? You can come to dinner. My dad makes some great chuletillas. Hey Alejandro! Okay, okay, thank you Alejandro. Yeah, I'll come to dinner and we'll work this out. Great. Here's to your business. Here's to you. And my business. (glasses clink) Get down, get down! (shouting in foreign language) Hector, what are you doing? She was asking for directions to the mall or something. Ay! I was just tryin' to help her out. I don't know, I thought it might be a drive by. Messed up my hair! Of course I understand. You can't help yourself. I can't help mys... (gasp) Se?or Lopez! Seeing is believing. You shine with such a light. Your aura is almost blinding. Look, what do you want? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Or all of the above? Well, I wasn't planning on shopping, but I could use a few things. Oh look, look here, we have some sardines. Oh, very good sardines. Oh, you coo coo for cocoa, yeah? Yes, that's very good. Oh, look. A little Lowrider. Oh mamacita, nice legs, huh? Yes! Would you like anything else? Well I don't have any money, but I got this check. I haven't seen so many zeros since my wife's family came for a visit. No, no, no, no. I will open up a credit account in your name, and you can shop here anytime you want. Money or no money. (speaks in foreign language) But, how 'bout the no credit rules that you have? (Mr. Ortiz laughs) Se?or Lopez, rules, for you, are made to be broken. I will personally deliver, to your house. Free of charge, of course. Oh no, no, no. You don't gotta carry the groceries for me. I'll carry them. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gracias. Let is shine, forever. Gracias. He really is rich, now. Ah, that car's probably stolen. Cops are gonna be here any minute. He's valet parking or something, please. Come on. Come on, baby, where you going? Hi. You look great. Juan, I love this change. I missed you, you know. [Juan] Why don't you say it louder so your boyfriend can hear you. (Anita laughs) Juan, he's not my boyfriend. [Hector] Come on, baby. Where you going? Hold your horses. You know, he's just a friend. This is a real beautiful car. Juan, did you buy this just so you can take me out for a ride? You broke up with me, remember? All I said was "how can I go out with man "who didn't have a car or a job." That's all. Can't punish a girl for being smart, now, can you? Now that you're rich, you have a car, you don't have to work, we can spend more time together, yeah? Maybe we can. Or maybe we can't. Don't keep my waiting. (truck honking) Don't keep him waiting. I'll be sitting by the phone. You do that. Sit right by the phone. I will. (car starts) Hey! We're gonna be so big! Gonna be so big! We're gonna be hangin' out! We're gonna have our own island, bro! We're gonna have our own island. Me and you, and like five, six... Who was that daddy? That's Flaco hollering some nonsense. I didn't get what he said. Mrs. Gonzales says that when a person dies and they're good they become an angel. [Mrs. Gonzales] Mhmm. And they come down to earth and they take care of somebody in their family. Mrs. Gonzales says that Mommy's my guardian angel. She's right, Mijo. Juan, maybe the man in the limo was your guardian angel. Did you recognize him? Nah. It was just some guy in a limo. God works in mysterious ways. You know, I really believe in that supernatural stuff. My father new the very day he was gonna die. Yeah, the judge told him. (laughter) [Jorge] But I don't think it's that way in this case. No, no. I think it's some crazy old guy who wants to play with your head, Juan. Juan. Juan! You need to get elevated, dog! We won! We won! We won! No Way, No Way, No Way. We won, dog. The odds on No Way were 40 to 1. Since you're my partner in crime, there it is, dog. $2,000. $2,000 all right there. But you can't have it yet, dog. I'm gonna reinvest in a very big, promising business venture, dog. You and I, we're gonna be big! Big, dog! Big! Big! Patricia? Patricia? Patricia? Are you okay, Mija? It's nothing, I'm okay. [Mrs. Gonzales] She's been working too hard. I told her not to go to work today. I'm fine. I'm okay. [Alejandro] Are you ever afraid, Dad? [Juan] Every second of every day. [Alejandro] What was the most scariest thing you're afraid of? [Juan] That something might happen to you. That I might lose you. Me too. Wouldn't you ever like to have a mother? I like it better when it's just the two of us. Anyways, I already have a mother. Yes you do. Tell me what she was like, again, Papi. She was the most beautiful woman. She had a great sense of humor. When she'd laugh her whole body would shake. Her eyes would disappear. She'd laugh so hard she'd cry. It was painful to watch her. She was so kind. And well mannered. Yes she was. She had great manners. Except for when I made her favorite dish; chilaquiles. She would sit there and lick her fingers and make a popping noise. It'd get on my nerves. Like this, eh Papi? (popping) Huh? Yeah, just like that. It's getting on my nerves now. (laugher) I love you, Daddy. (kissing) Juan, I think you'd better sit down. Juan, what do you want more than anything else in the world? [Juan] A green card. (items falling to ground) Come and get it, Juan. (Juan moans) Get it, come and get it. Juan, come and get it. (Juan moans) (coffee being poured) Alvaro, didn't I tell you to change that sock? I did change it. I'm wearing the other one. I need to get some kind of business going. With my skills, and his feria, there's no limit. What is it that every Chicano family needs, and very few have? Birth control. Chicano celebrity totem poles. Are you outta your tree? No, no, no. Picture this. Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa, Robby Benson, Lou Diamond, and Phillips. As tall as they want 'em. I head somewhere that the average person only uses one tenth of their brain. And I'm convinced, you're way below that average. Chicano celebrity totem poles. Pah. Don't worry, I got an idea. [Avero] Bye, ni?o. Have a good time. Bye bye. Adios Avero. Se?or Lopez! Mister Lopez, I have my daughter, I want you to meet her. She's the worlds best cook! She sews, she can clean. (speaking in foreign language) She'll make you a wonderful wife, if you... (door slams) - What! - Flaco, not now. Now check it out, dog! We're heading down to Vegas. I gotta lady luck with me, man. She's got a twin, brother, three of them! I've gotta go. I'm with my son, okay! Yo just touch me, man. Touch me. - Alright, here. - I've been baptized! Hey! As I see it, half of that check is mine. What? What half? What are you talking about half? Half. Oh okay, fine, fine. Have your people call my people. My people? Yeah, yeah, your people. You're a business man, eh? Yeah. - Okay, okay. - My people, yeah! My people. My people are going to call your people. And they're going to call you collect. And no game. You tell your people to wait by the phone. [Flaco] Juan, you're missin' out, son! [Alejandro] Hey Hector, go suck an orange! [Juan] And share it with your people! [Hector] Nobody messes with Hector Delgado. [Flaco] Juan! Man, we're gonna miss out, dog. (shouting) (joyful trumpet music) I should have never invited her here. She's gonna think this place is a dump. (knock at door) (fast mariachi music) How do I look? [Alejandro] Great, Daddy. (door creaks) Bonus nachos, Se?or Millionaire. Where's my rent? This is really beautiful. I mean, you'd never guess that a Mexican family lives here. I think I'm gonna have to raise your rent. You know, this phony millionaire bit may get you a few free beers at the bodega, but I ain't buyin' it. I want a check or I want cash, and I want it right now. Otherwise, you and the little one are outta here. Just give him the money. Come on, Primo, not again. Not this time. Please Jorge, just do as I say. Hi, are you the landlord of this building? Well why, yes I am pretty lady. I wonder if I might ask you a question. Well, of course. Well, I couldn't help but notice as I was coming up the stairs that most of them are broken and the hallways aren't lighted, there's exposed wiring and rat droppings everywhere, and the fire escapes don't work, and there's a big load of garbage on the side. So what's your question? My question is, why haven't any of your tenants called the building inspector or the health department? Because if they do I will call the immigration and they will deport their butts. Who are you? I'm Olivia Smith. Immigration. Well... Well then do your job! Send 'em back where they came from. You know they got no green cards, these people. The fact is I don't care who you are. They're gonna pay 50 dollars more rent every week, and it starts next week. Give me that. [Olivia] Have a nice day. (door closes) Anybody hungry? (clatter of utensils) [Alejandro] I helped Tio Jorge clean the bowls. [Juan] Like a Mexican casserole. Oh, Juan, this. This one. What is this? Oh, chilaquiles. Here. Let me serve you some more. Where did you learn how to cook like this? It's so delicious. Well, I've studied with some of the great chefs of LA. Yeah, washing their pots and pans. (laughter) But really, this is... I can't think of a time I've had a better meal. Neither can I. (popping) Juan, why don't you open a restaurant? That's what we said. Yeah, you guys could help him with it. And I could grow things for it. Or I could carve tables, chairs, whatever. Hey, and I can paint murals on the walls. You really think I could do it? Oh, of course you could. You're so gifted. And you're smart, and you're good with people, and you're funny, and... I mean all you really need to do is find a bank that will give you that loan so you can use that check as collateral. You know, it's funny. I got invited to a party by the vice president of the bank, Mr, uh... Dickerson. You mean Richard Dickerson? Who's giving that part on Radeo? Yeah, you know him? I'm going to that party. Maybe the two of you could go together? Aw, I can't. I'm going with my boyfriend. I mean, he was invited, I wasn't. I would just stay for the party. Ah, that's okay. I'm not gonna go anyways. I wouldn't fit in with all those Beverly Hills people. No, no. Aw, I'd be so happy if you would go. Then I'd have someone I could talk to. I don't fit in either. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, and I mean you should go because, um, 'cause he's obviously courting you for your business. He thinks you've got a million dollars. If you get him in the right mood maybe he'll give you a loan. I don't know. It doesn't sound possible. A million dollars? Of course it does. [Olivia] I think it does. You do? Well. With you there, I'd feel more confianza. If you were there I'd feel confianza, too. You would? I would. Yeah. Um. Let's clear the dishes. Alvaro. Huh? Let's clear the dishes. Oh here, let me... No, no, no. You're the guest. Alejandro, stay and keep her company. Well, are you gonna be my new mom? Excuse me? Are you gonna marry my dad? No, no honey. No honey, we're just friends your dad and I. We're just... We sort of, you know, work together. He thinks you're beautiful. He does, huh? He told you that? On the rooftop. On the rooftop? Yeah. That's where we talk and make wishes. (Olivia laughs) Well, I couldn't wish for a better dinner tonight. You licked your fingers. I know I did. It was impolite, was it? Yeah, a little. (Olivia laughs) But it was worth it. Where's your bathroom here? Um, it's the other door we have. [Jorge] I think I ate too much. [Alvaro] Well you better make it last, because that was our food budget for a week. (toilet flushes) (screams) (relaxed piano music) These people are very important for my business. The least you can do is dress like you live in the 90's. I thought it was pretty. Well at least your hair is up so I don't look like I'm walking in with Joni Mitchell. God. Hi. Are you, are you okay? You scared to go in? Yeah, me too. Olivia, please. Can we go in? Um, just, you go on ahead. Just, just a minute. Fine, fine. That's perfect. Story of my life. I go in alone while you stand and talk to people named Juan, and Jos?, and Kung-fu. Come on, Juan. Let's go in. They're just people. Are you sure? Not really. (laughter) You're scared, too. Yeah. I'm really scared. But why? You'll fit right in. Yeah? You think so? Well you will, too. I mean, look, everybody who meets you likes you, Juan. I like your dress. You look pretty. You look pretty, too. Come on. Let's go. It's just a house. It's just a... It's just a, it's a big house. It's a house. (choir music) You okay? Yeah, I'm still a little nervous. But I'm okay. Mr. Lopez! Oh, I'm so glad that you could make it, compadre. Oh, Mr. Dickereson, hi. Ah, I'm Dick to my friends. Please call me Dick. This is Angelica. Hi Angelica. Mr. Dick, this is Olivia Smith, my friend. Ah, Olivia. You look ravishing. Yes, yes. And you just, oh... Yes. A man that knows what he wants and how to get it. In short, a man of success. Now Juan, remember what I told you about contacts? Now we'll just leave you now to do what you do best. You must try some of my famous garlic pate. So Juan, what part of Spain are you from? The East side. (Angelica laughs) My favorite part! Angelica! Is that old Dick passed out, yet? Black Mercedes. (choir music) (relaxed jazz music) (women laughing) (Juan laughs) Well look, you can take your Deutsche Marks and just burn them. Look, I'm really planning on banking on an inversion of Hong Kong back to mainland China. It'll throw a screw in the whole works, and boy am I gonna make out. Look, it's up or down. What is your market? Bull or bear? Chicago's got a great team, huh? (woman laughs) Excuse us. [Angelica] Juan! Darling, come back! Where are you? Harold, please. Juan! Juan! Yoo-hoo! Juan! Harold! Harold! Juan, yoo-hoo! (choir music) Good evening. Good evening. It's a wonderful night. It sure is. Boy that Dickerson knows how to throw a bash, huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is a real clear evening. You know I haven't seen the stars since I was on vacation in Acapulco. Hard to see 'em here in LA. Too much smog. Wow, you see that? A shooting star. My grandma used to say that every time you see one of those you had to make a wish, right from the heart. Maybe you should, then. Nah. You don't think it's silly? No. What the hey? I got nothing else to lose. Are you a friend of Mr. Dickerson? Oh, sure. Been a friend of his for years. No actually. I'm lying. I hardly know him. He's just a business... What do you call him? Acquaintance. Yeah. What business are you in? Well I... To be honest I'm not in business. I know what kind of business I'd like to be in. I'd like to own a restaurant. Nothing fancy. Just good food at a good price. You see, in my restaurant, the bus boy will as important as the chef. A waiter would be more than just an arm that hands you water. See, I've done those kinds of jobs and I hate it when they don't look at you in the eyes. I'm a fraud is what I am. The only reason I'm here is because he thinks I've got money. If he only knew that the guys parking cars for him has more money than I do. Well, well, well. I see you've met my amigo. Yes. We were just talking. Dick. I would like to get a loan from you for a restaurant I plan to open. Clever businessman. Never use your own money unless you have to. What do you think? Should I or shouldn't I? I think Mr. Lopez is a man of integrity. Vision. I think his restaurant would do really well. Well then. It's settled. Now, come see me Monday. You can use your check as collateral. You'll be in business in no time. [Juan] Really Dick? [Richard] Yeah, really. No problem. Juan is quite a guy. Yeah, he is. You're a lucky woman. You know, look. All we have to do is you have to come over and give me some sort of estimate on how much you want to borrow, and we'll work out the... Oh, listen, would you excuse me for a moment please? He's gonna give me the money. You got the loan? That's so great! Let's go in and celebrate. Yeah, come on. I'll buy you a drink. I know! I speak Spanish, remember? (speaks in foreign language) Come here. Come here. May I just ask what is going on? Well I was just... You haven't met anybody. No, I know what you were doing. You were talking to the help. You spent the whole night talking to the help. Yeah. You're embarrassing me in front of my associates, quite frankly. Well now, quite frankly, you're embarrassing me in front of mine. He's an illegal alien. It's not the same. This is ridiculous. I just... I think your attitude is ridiculous. Okay, I think it's time to go home now. Why don't you go home. I want to stay. Fine. Okay, have one of your associates take you home. Fine. Okay. If there's room in the car. Let's talk about this when you get home. We need to talk about it. Fine. You want to take her home? You have a car? Take her home. Does it have a muffler? Aha. I'm really sorry about... When you go to celebrate something, where do you usually go? There's only one place. Take me there. This is me and Alejandro's favorite spot in the whole city. It's our little secret. Manuel. Maria's looking for you. [Manuel] Maria? Ay, chihuahua. I'm really in trouble. Poor guy. Guess the secret's out. (Oliva laughs) Alejandro said that you come up here to make wishes. He told you that? Yeah. I made a wish tonight. I saw a shooting star. When? At the party. When I got the money for the restaurant. So you got you wish. No. I'm sorry. Oh no, that's... Yes, yes. Usually I'm wrapped up in a serape up here. I don't notice. So, um, what do you and Alejandro talk about when you come up here. Father and son things. His homework. The Dodgers. He loves the Dodgers. But it's mostly about his mother. He must miss her a lot. Oh yeah. You must miss her a lot. Sure. Yeah. What was she like? (slow music plays over radio) I drank too much champaign tonight. I should take you home. No. It's beautiful up here. You're so beautiful. I love that song. Where is that coming from? Old Man Hernandez. He leaves his window open, blasts his radio. Everyone in the building complains. So do I. But not tonight, he's right on the money. (speaks in foreign language) What? Dance with me. No, I can't. I have to go. (radio plays song in foreign language) Close your eyes. (speaks in foreign language) I know that you're too good for me, and I shouldn't even have the right to be holding you, but I love you. I really, really love you. And I can't help myself, and if you say no it's fine. But I'm dancing with you, at least. Those aren't the words. Oh yes they are. Those are the very words. (upbeat Latin music) Marry me, Olivia. I can't live without you. I love you, Olivia. Oh that's poetic and romantic. Olivia, I know that I have no right to dream about someone like you, but that's why they call them dreams. You like that one, huh? What does it mean? Oliva, I know you deserve better than this simple ring... (Jorge laughs) That's honest. I like the last one best. But why? Because, I'm getting too personally involved with you. I can't do my job effectively if I'm personally involved with my clients. But what about all our plans. We don't have any plans, Juan. I'm your case worker, you're my client; that's it. - Did I do something wrong? - No. - Are you mad at me? - No! Look. Here's a list of possible restaurant locations. Just, just call them. Just find one. Talk to Mr. Dickerson, get a loan. Talk to Ms. Fargus when you want to make an appointment here, and... have a nice life. Olivia? What? Can I ask you something? What? You like chocolates? Oh no, Juan. She dumped me. I knew it. Wait a minute. What happened? She didn't want me or my chocolates. I am so sorry Juan. But remember; one door closes, another one opens. What is it with you and doors? What are you, a sales man? Forget her. What about Dickerson? I didn't go. I couldn't take being let down twice in one day. But Mr. Dickerson already said he'd give us the money. Yeah. And Olivia said she would help me. Well who needs that kinda help? If I've said it once, I've said it twice. There's only one way to handle it. [Brothers] As much as possible. Juan, Juan come quick! Patricia's fainted. Patricia. Patricia. Juan, look out. Here. Patricia! Call an ambulance. (somber string music) (Mrs. Gonzales cries) [Mrs. Gonzales] Ay, Dios m?o, no! [Alvaro] I know. C?lmate. - [Mrs. Gonzales] No! - [Alvero] Se?ora. [Mrs. Gonzales] No! [Alvero] (speaks in foreign language) (coffee being poured) I miss her already. Not as much as Alejandro will. Well at least she's in heaven now. Yeah. And we're left in Hell. (Jorge sighs) And there's nothing we can do abut that son of a... C?lmate, Jorge. C?lmate? That girl shouldn't be in heaven. She should right here, across the hall with her mother. That girl died of pneumonia because her window was broken. Because her heater was broken. Because Jenkins' promises were broken. And because every time I try to do something about it Juan, my primo, kept saying "c?lmate, c?lmate". Do as I say. Well what you sayin' now, Primo? "C?lmate"? Juan. Juan! (knocking on door) Mrs. Gonzales. It's me, Alejandro. (knocking on door) (dramatic orchestral music) La Mueren. Where is it? The saints and the angels. Where are they? I don't need 'em anymore. Here. This is for you. (paper rustling) It's Patricia. (Mr.s Gonzales cries) She's your angel now. (crying) (spacey drum beat) Hey, Rapa. Yes. I'll have my usual. What usual? You never drink anything. I'll have some tequila. Tequila? Tequila. Now I've been working here for what, 23 years? Never ever met anyone who found a solution in a bottle. Here's your tequila. Juan! What up, Rapa? Juan, you remember those guys? Our associates? The ones we did out big business venture with? Man they're slammin' me, man. They are slammin' me, you know what I'm sayin'? Remember? We won the horse No Way? The money? The loot? Why don't you just get lost? Aw man, what're you dissin' me for? What'd I do to you? Oh, that's the check, dog. Oh my god! This is it. This is it, man! This is... You know you should keep this thing. And you should take your scam somewhere else. Hey, what're you comin' down on me too, Rapa? What's up, man? What's this? Pick on Flaco day? (Rapa hisses) Go do your three card monte somewhere else. Aw it's gonna be like that? Fine! I'm going to the Juan, John. No offense. You see? You see that? You see that guy? This is the way the world is. One half of the world is guys like this; running around thinking that luck has an address or a zip code or something. And then you have the other kind of people. The people that have a heart and have dignity. Because they never, ever stop trying to do the right thing. And you, Juan, you should stop being a leaf in the wind. Make up you mind. Good, they're gone, dog. Yo, man. Lady Luck is a bitch, and she's moved. Hey man, what's up with your pad, dog? There's all kinds of furniture and stuff all over the place, man. Looks like a church's, but anyway, I gotta go. Thanks, Rapa. (crowd booing) Put the couch down. Put it down! What the hell do you think you're doin'? Put the couch down! Just what I need, a little drama in my life. What the hell do you think you're doing, Pancho? The woman just lost her daughter, probably because you wouldn't fix the heater, and now you're throwing her out on the street? Tell it to Geraldo. I mean if I want to hear a sob story, I'll watch a soap opera. One of your novellas, huh? Nothing matters with you, does it? Not her, not me, not none of us. It's all about money with you, isn't it? Look, it's the cops! The cops are here! (crowd shouts in panic) He's got a knife! (crowd booing) He pulled a knife on me! They took my daddy, they took my daddy. Who, me? I'm here for murder. Two guys. Two really big guys. (prisoner snorts) (Juan coughs) Contagious Hepatitis. (Juan coughs) Tuberculosis. (Juan coughs) Hong Kong Flu. (Juan coughs) Mexican Pneumonia. Hell, I'm a walking smorgasbord of diseases. (Juan coughs) [Correctional Officer] Lopez. Excuse me. (crowd cheering) Juan, I need to talk to you in private. Ah, it's a long story. But anyway, Jenkins is being prosecuted. He has to repair everything in the building. What happened to everything we got on credit? It was repossessed. Everything? Everything. I took the suits to back to the dry cleaners and then took them to the stores. You want to come in? Oh, hi Alejandro. Um, would you mind going inside for a minute? I have to talk to your daddy in private. Mijo, step inside and watch some TV. But if you need any advice, I'm inside. So, when are they sending me back? Next week. The INS will notify you. I'm so sorry, Juan. I really feel responsible. You were just doing your job. My ex-job. Your ex-job? I quit my job. Olivia, you can't quite. You help so many people. Didn't help you. I hurt you. Anyway... Anyway, I was always trying to help everybody buy myself, and now I'm doing something for myself. Oh yeah, what's that? Um... Well Jeff got a job offer in Seattle, and we're gonna go there together. So this is goodbye? Yeah. Juan, I just wish you the best life, - ...and I just know that you're gonna... - Do you love him? Be so happy wherever you go. Do you love him? Answer me. I have to go home and pack now. Because I know I love you more than he will ever be able to. Please don't. Don't go! Oh my god. Alejandro. Oh honey, I'm gonna miss you, too, sweetheart. I'm gonna miss you, too. You don't want to be my mom. No, that's not what I mean. Alejandro, that's not what I mean. Please. Please tell him that's not what I mean. Please tell him. (tragic orchestal music) (solemn trumpet music) Oranges! Good for what ails yah! No, I don't do business that way. Get me this albondigas. The albondigas. But get it like on a hamburger bun with mayo and ketchup. Nope. I'm too old and I'm too rich. Well at least I'm too rich. It's Gary. I'm sorry. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna look him right in the eye, and I'm gonna say "forget it". You, of course I'll say it. I'm gonna say "forget it"... What? I am a magnet for mariachi bands. This is ridi... (mariachi music) No, I can't hear you either. It upsets her, I don't know why. She makes no money. You know, I say if you have a social problem, never work for others. Oranges! (choir music) [Angel] Juan. Yeah? It's been 30 days. Here's the check. Hey look, mister. I don't know who you are, and I don't care. But have you any idea what your little game has cost me? Everything. My whole life's ruined. My dreams shot to hell thank to you. So I hope you're happy, because your little experiment: that's a success. [Angel] Go to this address. It's up to you whatever is next. (paper crumpling) I got better things to do! I don't know what that is, but I got better things to do. (slow jazz music) Naranjas, por favor. Dollar. # Senorita, don't go away. # # Senorita, won't you stay with me. # I love you, Juan. You do? Now that's what I call a kiss. Dad! Dad, look! "Juan, go to 11300 Vanit"? Dad didn't want to go, but Olivia and I talked him into it. The place looked like someone had put it through a garbage disposal. Olivia noticed some real estate papers on the inside of the door. It said, "Juan Lopez, proprietor". I said, "Dad, how can you be so happy? This place is a dump." And he said... [Juan] Yeah, Mijo, but it's our dump. (upbeat Latin music) [Alejandro] Everybody pitched in. Flaco and Anita handled promotions, as well as each other. Dickerson with an oven, neighbors with dishes, pots, pans, and furniture. And Uncle Jorge carved a huge sign that said "The Angel Cafe". (upbeat Latin music) - Yo! - Hey, Juan! Heres' to my good friend, Juan! Buenos suerte, Juan! [Alejandro] There's only one word to describe The Angel Cafe. And it's the same word everybody uses when they talk about my dad and Olivia's wedding: heavenly. I never understood when Grandma Tita would say to dad, that if revenge wasn't so sweet, it would be a lot easier to forget. (water spraying) (Jenkins shouting) I know just what Grandma Tita was talking about. (upbeat Latin music) Now we all live in a beautiful house, surround by avocado trees. That's right, all of us. Mrs. Gonzales, Uncle Alvaro, Uncle Jorge, my dad, Olivia, me, and my baby sister to be born, Esperanza, which means hope. My dad says we named her that, because that's what our angel gave us. The hope to dream, and the courage to go after it. (choir music) (mariachi music)
