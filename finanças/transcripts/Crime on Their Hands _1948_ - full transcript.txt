[♪] The Punjab Diamond, kiddies. Fourth largest diamond in the world. And it's all ours. What a hunk of ice. Yeah, hot ice, baby. Hotter than the lid of a pot-bellied stove. Hey, Dapper, when do I get the--? I said the rock was hot, didn't I? We're not pedaling this till things cool off a little. Oh, no you don't. You said I'd get my dough tonight. Hey, why you-- Smack me, will you? Double-cross me, will you? You ain't heard the end of this, big shot. I'll get mine. And believe me, you'll get yours. CAMERON: Well, men, this will be a tough assignment. Do you think you can cover it? MOE: Yes, sir. Beat up pretty bad, Mr. Cameron, but we'll cover it. When we put it back on your chair, you'll think you got a new seat. Good, and make it snappy, will you? Oh, I'll be back in half an hour. This story's liable to break wide open any minute. MOE: "Punjab Diamond stolen." "Daring bandits raid muh-seum in daylight." "Museum." Museum. Ain't that something? Inside job? It could be. Anyway, I'm putting every available man on the job. Oh, boss, how about trying us out as reporters? Yeah, news hawks. That's our dish. Tear out the front page. Stand by for a scoop. Stop the presses. Copy boy, copy boy, stop the presses. [CRUNCHING] [GROANS] Moe, Moe, stop the presses. Now, behave. What do you say, boss? Will you give us a break? Well, um, you boys see me after a while, will you? I'm going out and grab a bite of supper. Okay. Get busy. Go ahead. Go ahead. Uh-huh. Clean this mess up. Oh. Go on, you... Ooh. Ow. Ooh. Ow. Oh, Moe, I'm sorry. Ooh, oh, oh. Now, I'm sorrier. How do you feel? You look like a bird in a gilded cage. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yeah, this is the Gazette. Huh? If you want some dope on the Punjab Diamond, go to Squid McGuffey's Café. There's a guy named Dapper. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. You know what that was? A hot tip on the Punjab Diamond. Boy, will Cameron be tickled to get this. "Go to Squid McGuffey's Café. Ask for Dapper." Hey, that's a scoop, fellas. Now's our big chance. You know, porcupine, for a guy without brains, you're a genius. If we get this story, the boss has gotta give us a break. Oh, boy, I'm a reporter. Tear out the front page. Stand by for a scoop. Stop the presses. Stop the presses. Okay, kid. Okay, you're a reporter, but remember: I'm the boss. In the movies, the reporter always talks back to the boss. [AS REPORTER] Now, listen, you glass-eyed baboon, I'm the best reporter you've got, and you know it. You been shoving me around long enough, doing dirty work for this paper, but I ain't gonna take it anymore. I quit. See? I quit. And what are you gonna do about it? Get out of here. Oh. Oh. Say, you didn't by any chance see that picture too? No, chief. I'll take orders, chief. Okay. That's for absolutely nothing. Hey, press badges. That makes it official. Now we're real reporters. Okay, let's get on the job, chief. Say, you got your press badge? Okay, on the scoop. ALL: Scoop. MOE: Right. [RINGING] Hello. Yes? Yes? Yes? No. No. Who was it? Wrong number. Get out of here. [CRASHING] I ought to slap on a 10 cent cover charge to keep out the riffraff. What goes on? [SNORTING] Here you are, Harold old boy. Supper. Mind your manners, there, Harold. You're not in the jungles now, you know. [HAROLD GROWLS] Hawkins, what's that monkey doing in here? I brung him from Africa, Mr. Squid. A circus will pay a pretty penny for the likes of him, they would. Well, you better close your deal tonight. That killer ain't staying in my place. He ain't no killer. He's just as gentle as a little kitten. Ah... Boy, what a dive. I wonder which one of these guys is Dapper. Nobody looks dapper in here. We'll snoop around the joint till we find him. Anybody wants to turn back, now is the time. Oh, deserters, eh? Come on, boys, put on a bold front. Act tough. Hey, are you Dapper? Are you? Ow! [CRASHING] Uh-uh. Glasses. Yeah, you can't hit a man with glasses. Come on. Oh. Here. Pardon me, mister, we're looking for a guy called Dapper. Never heard of him. Who are you? Now, he's in here somewhere, do you mind if we look around? No, help yourself. Thanks. Boss, them cops are heading for the back room. Don't lose your head. Give Bea the high sign. [ALARM BUZZING] There's nobody home here. Nobody home here, either. Boy, was I mistaken. Just a minute. How dare you? Take it easy, sister. We're looking for a guy named Dapper. Dapper? I never heard of him. I'm all alone. Good. I mean, we'll check on that. Look everywhere, men. Keep your mind on your business. You too. Use a fine-toothed comb. I haven't got a comb. Will a wire brush do? Why, fine. Oh. Oh. [GROANING] Hey, fellas. Hey, fellas, look. "D," that stands for Dapper. That's my cigarette case. Just a minute. Oh, yeah? Oh, boy, evidence. Let's weigh it. Let's smoke it. Quiet. Sister, you ain't fooling nobody. We're camping right here till Dapper shows up. Woo. He-- He thinks I'm lying. Any half-wit can see I'm telling the truth. Yeah, I can see you're telling the truth. BEA: Oh, I feel so awful. I've never been in trouble before. But why should you suspect me of harboring a common criminal? With oranges, it's much harder. [BELCHES] [CRIES OUT] She's fainted. Fellas, help. Do something. Look out. Get some water, quick. What happened, kid? She must have got a good look at you. Come on, sister. Here's the water. Oh, thanks. How do you like that? You all right, kid? Oh, yes. It's just that you policemen frighten me so. Policemen? But we ain't cops, lady. We're reporters. Reporters? Yeah, this is our first assignment. And your last. STOOGES: Ooh. Muscles. Dapper. Well, what gives? Boys, meet the press. These guys ain't detectives, they're reporters. Reporters? How fascinating. Yeah, and this nitwit swallowed the diamond. Me? That last mint was it. Well, scoop, are you gonna give it back, or do we get it the hard way? Oh, boss, let me finish him. I love to rub out reporters. Give me room, will you? Give me room. I'll give it to ya. [COUGHING] Holding out on us, huh? Cough it up. Cough it up. Hold it. Hold it. Maybe you boys have some influence with your friend. I'll give you five minutes to get that rock. Five minutes or we'll cut it out of him. Wait a minute. We'll handle this. Give it to them, you fool. I would if I could, but I can't. You want 'em to slice you up like a watermelon? Let me try it again, will you? Go ahead. [COUGHING] [SQUEALS] Come on, you. Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Wait a minute. We ain't getting no place. He's just being stubborn. I got a better idea. [GROANS] Now you're getting smart. Open your mouth. [CRIES OUT] Oh. [GAGGING] [GEARS CRANKING] [CRANKING] SHEMP: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh. Oh. Oh. [CRANKING] Must be caught on something. LARRY: Maybe it's his appendix. We'll soon find out. You got a longer one of these things? [GASPS] Wait a minute. Not even a tonsil. And now I'll try. Gentlemen, I, uh-- I think this calls for an operation. No, no, not that. Sorry, boys. This way, right in there. Thanks, darling. You better wait outside. This is no place for a weak stomach. I got a weak stomach. All right, Muscles, let's get to work. The desk. No, no, please, cut it out. "Cut it out." That's just we're gonna. Oh. [MUFFLED SHOUTING] Hey, they're killing him. We gotta get out of here. We're trapped like rats. Speak for yourself. Oh. MOE: Oh, boy. Where'd you get the tools? On the head. Good. A saw. A turner-arounder. We'll go out that way and call the cops. Get busy. Right. [MUFFLED SPEECH] DAPPER: Now, now, just relax, sonny boy. It'll all be over in a minute. Okay, out of the way. Ooh. Pardon me. Get out of my way, will ya? [GRUNTS] We'll be safe in a minute. Struck a snag. Hey, Moe, Moe. How is it, pretty tough? Yeah. Take over. Come on, kid. I think we can make it. You go ahead. I'll take a weapon. Right. [GROWLS] [CRIES OUT] You dummy, you. I know. Go on. Do as you're told. Ya-ah-ah. Ya-ah-ah-ah! [CRIES OUT] Moe, there's a-- Quiet. There's a big thing. Listen. Listen, you. Yeah? You afraid to go by yourself? Yeah. All right, I'll take you by the hand-- Yeah, yeah. --little boy. LARRY: Look, Moe, you gotta listen to me. Come on. How do you like this guy? Too scared-- [BOTH CRY OUT] [DINGS] The rock should be around here someplace. It better be. [DINGS] [CLINKS] There it is. Good. Hey. Ain't you even gonna put him to sleep? You're gonna get technical, eh? In the closet. [MUFFLED SPEECH] [CLINKS] Yeah, that's it. [SNORTS] Give me the whetstone. [MUFFLED SPEECH] Now, now, relax. This isn't going to hurt you at all. Ha. Well, okay. Anesthetic. [MUFFLED SPEECH] Come on. Come on. Give it to me. Hey, what-- [GROANS] Muscles. Muscles. Get away from me. I'll-- I'll let you have it. Hey, Muscles, get this beast off of me.
