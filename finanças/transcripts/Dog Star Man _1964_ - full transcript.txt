Dog Star Man (a dialogue) by Jan-Pieter ‘t Hart for Cosmos Carl V: So what are we watching? A: It’s this film that I once watched on my laptop. A: It’s called Dog Star Man. A: I didn’t watch it here in my living room, I was on the train. I took a train ride on a late night, the last one ... of the night, actually. I just got back from this ... birthday party of a distant friend of mine. I was feeling kinda icky and out of it the whole night, I couldn’t really connect, there were a lot of people ... ... there that I kind of knew but not really, and every conversation just took so much energy. Anyway, it doesn’t really matter, what matters is I took a train ride back home, I had a laptop with me and decided ... to watch something. To get my head elsewhere. So I opened my laptop, checked my local files because the ... WIFI on the train is shit. I only had a few films on there, one of them was ... this one. I remembered a good friend of mine ... recommended it to me and transferred it a few months ... earlier. He told me how amazing it is, how he ... watched it once in a cinema, in this small, run down ... arthouse cinema in the east side of town, you might ... know it, I think we've been there together once or twice. And I remember him telling me how much it impacted him... So it's basically this completely silent film, as you can see. It's more or less an abstract experience but it has some ... narrative to it, according to the critics. It runs for over an hour, and it's quite a ... challenging ride. My friend told me how extaordinary it was ... seeing this on the big screen, in this dark cinema, ... with only the flickering lights, and mostly, how aware he was of the people around him, trapped in the same experience. How he heard all the coughs, the whispers, the gulps of beer, the squeaking of the door ... in the back, people going to the toilet, or going to ... get another beer, or giving up on the film altogether. But he also told me that, at some point, he wasn't really paying attention to all of that ... anymore, he was really there with the images, sucked into the flickering light, into the abstraction. He was describing it as some kind of catharsis, a transcendence of the physical into the ... extraterrestial, of simultaneous unconsciousness ... and hyperconsciousness. Or something like that. And I remember telling him how jealous I was of him, how I'm always hyper aware of everything and everyone ... around me, and how I can never fully immerse ... myself into a film when I'm watching it in a cinema. It's like the feeling when you get the AUX cable ... at a house party and all of a sudden ... you are listening to the music you love so much ... through the ears of everyone in the room... It's awful. Anyway, sorry. Long story short: I was watching this on the train back home coming from this ... birthday party and I had a complete opposite experience ... from my friend [laughs]. But in a good way, kind of. I was sitting in a near empty compartiment, in a two-seat ... with my laptop in front of me, ... no headphones needed, and I remember how much ... I loved the images, and how much I could imagine ... my friend having this cathartic experience ... in the movie theater. But for me, right there, the images weren't ... overwhelming at all. They were like a companion, for my thoughts, and my physical presence. Everything around me grew so loud, my mind and my surroundings, the flashing lights from the train windows, my recollections from the party, the attempted conversations, the beers I had a few hours ago, it was all so very present. And I never finished it. I had like 15 minutes left when it was my stop. This is almost a year ago, and I still haven't finished it, so when you proposed to watch something together, I thought of this. V: So why now? A: Mainly because I wanted to rewatch it. I don't revisit things often enough. I'm a sloppy consumer, always in a rush. I really hate this, because hardly anything ever ... really sticks, you know? I have this internalized neo-libral inside of me ... that just wants to keep adding things to the pile. Growth and accumulation. I think it's a weird sort of... cannibalism, being someone who makes things as well. V: Cannibalism? In what sense? In the way Oswald de Andrade uses the term? A: Who's that? V: Oh I don't know much about him, but he is this Brazilian modernist, a poet who wrote a minfesto in the 1920s. Translated to English it's called the Cannibal Manifesto. It's very referential, and to be honest ... I didn't get much out of it. From what I know it's a celebration of how Brazilian ... culture cannibalizes on other cultures and thrives ... off of it. In it there's this famous line: "Tupi or not Tupi: that is the question." So it references the Tupi, a tribe of indigenous ... Brazilian peoples who, in some shape or form, practiced cannibalism. And at the same time this sentence cannibalizes itself: it eats Shakespeare and Shakespearian legacy.. A: That's cool... I guess that's more or less what I mean. My longing to consume as many Beautiful things as possible ... is sometimes so big that it consumes itself. These are the worst days, when I'm oversatured, and overstimulated, scrolling through my ... watchlist or my Spotify library and not longing for ... anything in particular. It's depressing. V: Why is that so depressing? You can just accept that you're fed, right? That you are full, and digesting. A: Of course, that is exactly what I should do more often. That's why I wanted to rewatch this, to expand on one experience instead of hurrying ... to the next one. But now all we do is blabbing over it. V: That's okay for me. I don't mind that we talk ... over it. We are just soundtracking it [smiles]. [silence] V: Oh shit, this was only the prelude... okay. A: Yes, it’s quite a watch. But beautiful, right? After this it's getting more... lyrical, I believe. [silence] A: I forgot to mention, but this film is a collection of four or five shorts, made over the course of as many years. I looked up a bit about the process before, and he intended this prelude that we just watched to be... Do you wanna hear this? Or should I just let you watch it? V: No no, continue. Cool. He imagined the film or at least the prologue ... to be like a dream. Not a depiction of a dream, but the dream itself, as experienced from the embodiedness of the dreamer. Watching it, I think it kinda makes sense. You feel lost but you're also a part of this very specific ... cosmos of color and flashes and scratches and rhythm. And then there are these occasional sparks of life, as a memory, or a déjà vu. [silence] V: You know, I like how we are watching this ... and analysing it, wording it, at the same time. It's probably a bit barbaric, but I like this as well. It is a kind of guerilla viewing I just imagined Stan... what's his name, ... Stan Brackade? how he was probably this pompous white man with big ideas about Cinema and Life, you know, 20th century stuff. And here we are, when was this made? 50 plus years later ... on the fourth floor of a studio building in Amsterdam, overlooking a car wash and a car rental ... and some anonymously grey warehouses. Sitting at your desk, watching his masterpiece, his opus, every frame crafted with care ... and juxtaposed in this painstaking montage, and we watch it in this bright lit room ... on a 17" MacBook, and you couldn't even be bothered ... to move the cursor so the video player hides the progress bar. No 16mm projector, no cinema room, no event, just us. I'm not being ironic or mocking the film or the filmmaker's ... efforts when I say that I really find this beautiful. It's another way of relating to something. Stan probably didn't anticipate home viewing, at least not when he was making this in the 60s. But we are engaging with it, and keeping it alive, even though his work mutated into pixels on a laptop screen. [silence] A: I think I agree. I noticed in the comments something you will like. Here, I will scroll down a bit. Here is this thread of comments where people share which album . they put on while watching the film. CAN, Stereolab, William Basinski Coil, Earl Sweatshirt [laughs]. And I get it, I did the same thing with another film ... by Stan, it was called Anticipation of the Night. He made it a few years earlier . and it has the same vibe, more or less. I paired it with a compilation of ambient tracks ... I'd been listening to a lot back then. Stan probably would've hated this, he wanted to strip cinema to it's core and show film itself, the materiality of the surface. But I'm not sure if I agree with that. I'm not sure I agree with this purification, it somehow makes me suspicious. V: I trust John Cage more, I guess he was his contempory by the way, I trust him more when he says that ... he never shuts the windows when he composes. He welcomed the noise. It kinda relates to some texts I've been reading. I think I have one in my bag. Want me to read a bit? A: Sure. V: It's by Bourriaud, this French curator ... who was involved in the art scene of the 90s. Douglas Gordon, Félix González- Torres, you know the lot. He coined the term 'relational art' ... and he makes some pretty great points, actually. This is from his book 'Relational Aesthetics': Hold on. Here: "Otherwise put, the role of artworks is no longer to form .. imaginary and utopian realties, but to actually be ... ways of living and models of action within the existing real, whatever the scale chosen by the artist. Althusser said that one always catches ... the world's train on the move: Deleuze, that "grass grows from the middle" ... and not from the bottom or the top. The artist dwells in the circumstances ... the present offers him, so as to turn the setting ... of his life (his links with the physical and conceptual ... world) into a lasting world. He catches the world on the move, he is a tenant of culture, to borrow Michel de Certeau's expression." And here he talks about animism: "If one of these atoms swerves off course, it "causes an encounter with the next atom ... and from encounter to encounter a pile-up, and the birth of the world." ... this is how forms come into being, from the "deviation" and random encounter between ... two hitherto parallel elements. In order to create a world, this encounter must be a lasting one: the elements forming it must be together in a form. Form can be defined as a lasting encounter." A: So what he’s saying is that we are completing ... this film by relating to it? That there’s no film without viewers? V: So the whole book is one plea ... for “formations rather than forms”, as he calls it. One last citation, I promise. Maybe Stan would’ve liked this passage as well: “In a way, an object is every bit as immaterial ... as a phone call. And a work that consists of a dinner around a soup ... is every bit as material as a statue.” [silence] A: So what do you think of it? We’ve been talking around it, but not really about it. V: [laughs] Yes, I guess that’s the difference between us. I spiral around things ... and you want to get straight to the point. V: I don’t know what I think about it… But it makes me think, it’s engaging. It’s not something I would decide to watch, and that’s why I like that you decided for me. You know, sometimes I think I’m too conditioned by academia, I always think in terms of... I don't know, value. Which is important, of course, but I get stuck I'm when trying to value a work like this. My cynical side wonders why I should watch ... this sisyphean character with a dog climbing a snowy mountain, what the point is of watching this in 2021. I mean 2022, shit... It all seems a bit dated, it’s not about living but about Life, you know? It’s so sacred and spiritual, in a masculine kind of way. Like a feature length black metal video [laughs]. But I like how hopelessly romantic it is, it is kind of endearing. A: Hmm... [silence] V: What are you doing there on your phone? A: [laughs] Sorry, it’s a bad habit. I’m reading Letterboxd reviews of this film. It’s pretty amusing, actually. V: Wanna read me some? A: The top one kind of echoes what you were saying, but this guy is head over heels about it. Listen to this: “A tremendous juxtaposition of t a man that has towards ... superior forces, towards transce dence and towards our ... inherent piritual perpetuity, contemplating the vastness ... of existence and the beginning of humankind ... and its continuation through procreation.” V: Hmm. Too Christian for me. A: You’ll like this one better, its motto is a song by Miley: “Ain't about how fast I get there ... Ain't about what's waiting on the other side ... It's the climb (yeah)” V: What do they say? A: This one is also pretty lyrical. But it’s more… relational. This is the closing paragraph: “I want to watch this many more times in my life. I want to watch it with all different kinds of music. I want to watch it with my friends. I want to watch it with strangers. I want to watch it on the biggest and smallest screens. I want to watch it outside. I want to watch it high. I want to watch it as a I drift gently off to sleep.” [laughs] Hear this one: “Lost track of whatever was happening 3-4 minutes in, still managed to not die out of boredom.” [silence] A: I’ve been thinking about what you said, about what the point is of watching a film like this ... in 2022. And I get it… there is something obsolete about it, it is definitely out of touch with this time, with any time I would argue. This was made in the 60s, there was plenty of shit going on back then ... and it doesn’t deal with that either. But I think that is part of the appeal too, for my friend who recommended it to me, and for me, watching it on the train back home ... after a shitty night. It is a kind of nostalgia. Not a nostalgia for a tempo- rality or a specific memory, but for a kind of non-time. A: I remember a review of a triennial in the States, it was in an art magazine, and the writer was considering why he could hardly find ... any works in the exhibition that looked new, that looked like they were a reflection of its time. I’d like to read you a bit of the closing paragraph. I think I can make it just before the film finishes. Let me just look it up. V: You wanna have the last word, huh? [grins] A: OK, reading back it is all a bit of a truism, but I will read it anyway: "These have been five crazy years, at times so intense, so full of paranoia and mania, it’s surprising that we’ve ... ended up with an art that’s so traditional and nostalgic. During these years, people have been afraid of so many things: The Trump presidency. Racism. The rise of fascism. That Facebook has been manipulating our minds. That the Russians are hacking our consciousnesses. That free will no longer exists. North Korean nuclear tests. Islamic terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Shaman-involved insurrection. Pepe the sad cartoon frog. Irony. Ambiguity. EVIL artists and writers. Greta sailed across the ocean to Manhattan to warn us about ... climate change. We’ve been scared of the global pandemic. Of cities, of going outside. Of spending time with one another, of social proximity. We’re frightened of each other. And so much else besides. What these surveys of the present seem most afraid of ... though, is the present, and the future, which is considered completely doomed; and that’s a shame."
