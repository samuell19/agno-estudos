I DREAM IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE We'll be right back to “If you turn it on, you'll surely learn.” Before we continue, we want to say hello... ...to our friends from San Isidro who are listening somewhere in the US. Today, in our English lessons... ...we will learn practical questions for the traveller. I need a job. Don't you want some? They're here! Now you'll have to wait. I want to work. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Santiago... - ...welcome. - Thank you very much! - Welcome, Martín. - Thank you. This is Flaviana. Doña Jacinta's daughter. Delighted... ...thank you for letting me stay in your home. What do you think? Do you like it? - Yes, it's very nice. - It is nice. isn't it? I need a place to live. Mother... ...he's here... Mother... ...what are you doing out of bed? The doctor said... At my age I can do whatever I want. Chupi, Doña Jacinta... ...chupi. It's an honor to meet you. You're a child. I'll make you some coffee. So... ...you want to learn how to speak Zikril? Well... ...I will do my best. Zikril is a very powerful language. We don't want it do die... ...but we don't want it to fall into the wrong hands. No, don't worry. I study languages. Please, could you say something in Zikril? I'd love to hear it in your own voice. That's pretty. What does it mean? Mother, wait for me. Chupi, Jacinta. Mother don't run. Chupi, Don Isauro, nice to meet you. He says he is very happy that you are here. You look like a good person... ...and he will teach you everything about Zikril. Thank you very much... ...thank you. But the only thing he asks of you... ...don't make him work with Evaristo. Evaristo? Who is Evaristo? Evaristo. How are you? Who the hell is this? This is Martín... ...a young linguist. He wants to talk to you. - Chupi, Don Evaristo. - About what? We thought there were only two speakers of Zikril. Your name isn't in the census. Good afternoon. - Hello. - You... - ...go inside. - Excuse me. All I want is to record some conversations between you, Doña Jacinta... - ...and, if possible, Don Isauro. - Get out. - I'd like you to think about it. - No. Get out! Oh, Evaristo! Bitter as always. Excuse us. Grandfather, are you OK? Why did Don Isauro and Don Evaristo fight? They fell in love with the same woman. Evaristo almost killed Isauro over María. He kicked him out of town. Since then, Don Isauro... ...walked away from everything and everyone. They haven't talked to each other in 50 years. Thank you very much. This will be one of the many conversations we'll record... ...surely later... What do you know about us, the Zikril? Very little is known about the Zikril culture. It developed around the year 500, they we're polytheistic... Oh child, you know nothing! We want to show you something. In the beginning... ...Woman Bird fell in love with the first man to walk the Earth. He also fell in love with her. But since they didn't speak the same language... ...they couldn't consummate their love. Woman Bird... ...decided to teach him how to speak Zikril... ...the language of all beings that live in the jungle. From this union we were born and from that moment on... ...men and animals, we all speak the same language. I told you that you didn't know anything about us. Good morning. She was very sick. Attend to Doña Rosina. My mother... ...she passed away. What happened? Well, her heart was failing. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... - No, don't mention it... ...she saw it coming. Well... ...actually... ...she's not really dead, dead... What do you mean? Can you hear them? It's the river from last night. It wasn't a river... ...it was them. When a Zikril dies... ...they all come out to get him and bring him here. Are all the Zikril inside? Yes. In an eternal celebration. They call it “The enchantment”. - Are they alive? - No, no, no... ...only the Zikril can enter. Wait. Mother! Come out! Just a second! Martín wants to talk to you. Surely she's drunk. Good afternoon. What do you want? - Can I talk to you? - No. Doña Jacinta passed away last night. Did you hear? Now, Don Isauro and you are the last two speakers of Zikril left. - I know you've had differences... - More salt. I know you've had differences in the past but, I beg you to reconsider. - I'll talk to him. - Get him out of here. Please go. - The study of this language... - Only you care about Zikril. They are the last speakers of Xatlán. Am I right? Right. Thanks to these conversations we can know how their language works... ...at least on a basic level. It would take years to understand it fully. It's the same thing with Don Evaristo and “the crazy Indian”. Yes, my project is to analyze as many languages as possible in Mexico. But Don Isauro is not crazy. Simply, and thanks to Zikril he can communicate with his animals. There is still no proof of that. That's why it's so important to find another native speaker. Lluvia, tell your grandfather to knock it off and help this gentleman. It's common for the last speakers of any language to be at odds... but I've seen how they've made up thanks to the very same language. Yes, but let's not forget the linguist's golden rule: never force its speakers to do anything they don't want to do. Let's hope you find another native speaker... ...if you listen The Voice of San Isidro, your very own community radio... ...and you know somebody, call us. And now, We go to Lluvia and her English lessons. But first, and to relax a little, let's listen to some music. Hello, Lluvia. - I'd like to ask you... - Shall we go? How can I approach your grandfather? - Is there something he wants? - Martín. - He's handsome. - You're crazy. - Oh, come on. - No. We're back to “If you turn it on, you'll surely learn”. Today we'll see the days of the week. - Ready, Marthita? - Ready. Now, we start with the months of the year. - Good morning. - Good morning. Excuse me, do you know someone who speaks Zikril? No. How are you? We haven't talked in a long time. The same. I miss my grandmother very much... ...don't you? It's going to be five years now. She wanted you to be happy. Have you ever been happy? Don't be ridiculous. Thirty-two patients from the General Hospital... ...and medical and administrative personnel... ...were evacuated to other hospitals in the area. Easy, Don Isauro... ...easy. Hi. I know how you can convince him to talk to Don Isauro. But promise you will never tell him I told you. Promise. He wants a new television. Ours is very old and we can't afford a new one. What made you change your mind? Deep down I know he still wants to be friends with Don Isauro. That's what my grandmother used to say. How are you going to convince Don Isauro? I don't know... ...but first your grandfather. Where can I find him so we can talk alone? At church... ...he likes to go on Sundays around six, when it's empty. OK. The church is very pretty. Do you want it short or just a little off the sides? You know how. The other day I wanted to watch TV and it stung my eyes. We have to buy another one, don't you think? But they are really expensive. We could reach an economic agreement, Don Evaristo. I could speak with the people at the university... ...or I could work around your house. I could paint it in a color you'd like. Maybe you need a new appliance? A refrigerator, a stove... But they are really expensive. I have some money saved, but it won't be enough. - You're sleeping with that linguist. - Of course not! Tell me the truth or I'll rip your tongue out. He just wants to bring you and Don Isauro back together, for his work. It's about the Zikril, nothing else. He said he could get us a new television. He only needs to record some conversations and it won't take much of your time. Don't you want to know how your friend is doing? You could work things out, clarify things... ...and forgive. Why didn't your grandfather ever teach you Zikril? I think he didn't want me to speak to Don Isauro, ever. Why not? I don't know... My English is terrible. Soon I will bring your friend so that you have someone to talk to, Don Isauro. Look how nice it is, Don Evaristo. C'mon, accept it. Do it for Zikril. We both know you want it. Fine. Thanks. But listen to me carefully... if you lay a finger on her, I'll kill you. You have nothing to worry about. Why do you want to go to the United States? Why don't you stay here and learn how to speak Zikril? No... ...there's nothing here. Besides, I want a better life, not to talk to the beetles. But imagine your radio program could be in Zikril. Hopefully your grandfather and Don Isauro can be friends again. Hopefully. My grandmother told me they used to do everything together when they were young. How many things have been left unsaid over all these years? Forgive me... They're here to pick you up. Good morning, Don Evaristo. Good-bye, Grandfather. It's best if you wait here. OK? Don Isauro! Good morning! Martín! Don Evaristo came to work with us. Come on, let's work. He's over there. Let go of me! Don Isauro, are you all right? Get up, Don Isauro. Please, get up. What happened? - Tell me they didn't fight. - No, everything is fine. We just have to be more careful. There's something I don't understand. What? Why exactly did they fight? - They fell in love with your grandmother. - Yes. But she married your grandfather. - Right? - Yes. - Was she ever in love with Don Isauro? - No. - Did they ever cheat on him? - No. Did Don Isauro try to stop the wedding? - Did he try to hurt them? - Never. No, no, and no. Why does your grandfather still hate Don Isauro? Because they were both in love with her. That is what I don't understand. If Don Isauro never harmed them and she never had any feelings for him... ...why does your grandfather still feel... I don't know, so threatened? I don't know... Do you want them to make amends or not? - I do. - Then tell me the truth. I swear I won't tell anyone. Isauro! - My name is: - My name is... - ...Jacinta. - Jacinta, very good. My name is: - My name is Isauro. - Very good. - My name is: - My name is... - ...Severino. - Severino, very good. I can't understand you. He says he's going to make you a necklace. Oh, Isauro, how can you speak words of love... ...if you can't speak Spanish? He's like a little animal. Yes, sometimes. I like your laugh. Let's go swimming! Let's go! There is no worst sinner... ...than he who wants to get away with it... ...he who hides... ...to not be discovered. But that sinner is a fool, for God sees it all. There are no secrets... ...His justice reaches the deepest corners. There, where you try to commit your depravities. Because he... Hello, María. Can I talk to you? Come in. I just... I want to ask you something. María... I love you. Do you want to be my girlfriend? Where is Isauro? I don't know. Why? I went looking for you the other day. I looked for you and... Where were you? In the other village, I went to the market. With Isauro? I went alone. Why are you asking so much about him? I can't be your girlfriend. Why not? Because I saw you. I didn't want to, María. It was him... ...he forced me. Is that true? Yes. I hate him. Do you repent? Yes, María, help me... ...help... Swear that you won't tell a soul about his. Swear it, María. Swear it. I swear. I love you. I love you too. But smile... ...I miss your laugh. Isauro is coming. Shortly afterwards, they married. They never spoke about what happened. But why did she tell you everything? She wanted me to talk to him... ...to set him free to go with Don Isauro. If my grandfather finds out I know everything... ...he'll be very embarrassed. I can't. He wants to be buried here. But I would like him to go to “The Enchantment”... ...with Don Isauro. Me too. Tell us Martín, how are you feeling? Very excited. Where does your passion for languages come from? My grandfather was a linguist. And since I was a little boy we had a very close relationship. That's how I began to get close to this kind of knowledge. What are you expecting from this reunion? It's been decades since Don Evaristo and Don Isauro have spoken to each other... so a conversation between them should be very interesting. You're going to be late. C'mon. I'll wait for you here. - Are you nervous? - Yes, I am a little nervous. Do you think they'll come? I'm sure they will. Hopefully they will, and congratulations, Martín. Thanks. Welcome Don Evaristo! It's good that you're here. Hello, Lluvia. Thank you. Please, make yourself comfortable. As soon as Don Isauro gets here, we'll start. Here comes the crazy Indian! The crazy Indian! Kids, don't call him that. - Don't call him that. - The crazy Indian! Careful, Don Isauro. Welcome, Don Isauro. Good afternoon. Thank you everyone for being here. Welcome. This is the first session between Don Evaristo and Don Isauro. Don Evaristo... ...would you please translate for Don Isauro? OK. I'd like to tell you that there are no words... ...to thank you for the tremendous effort you are doing for Zikril. Thank you. Please tell us what the town was like when you were kids. Lluvia... my child. Lluvia. - Open up, motherfucker! - It's my grandfather... Don Evaristo! I told you not to touch her you piece of shit! But I love her, Don Evaristo... ...and if you don't kill me, I will make her very happy! Lluvia! Do you believe this motherfucker? Yes, I do. You can come out now. I love you too. If all goes well, I could come live here for a few years... ...to work with them. Would you like that? Yes. A lot... ...and I also want to learn Zikril. Good afternoon, Don Evaristo... - Welcome. - Afternoon. I'll help you with the chair. Well... - Have a drink. - Thank you. A snack... Friend, upive. Upive means friend in Zikril? Martín upive. Hey, hey. This meal is to celebrate Don Isauro and Don Evaristo... the last two speakers of Zikril. - Cheers! - Cheers! When I was a child... ...my mother used to sing me a song in Zikril... ...and I would like to sing it to you. Maestro... Don Isauro... Don Isauro! Evaristo! Leave me alone! No! But, why did he have to take it out on her? Jealousy... ...and because he can't fight your grandfather. But she's dead and she suffered a lot, Martín. Yes, but imagine how angry he must be. Stop making excuses for him. Why are you on his side? Because he's my friend. And it was Evaristo who attacked him first. - You forced them to work together. - You did too, Lluvia. Yes... ...but you knew that you shouldn't have forced them. And all, because of the Zikril. We were fine until you showed up to save your fucking Zikril. Don Evaristo! Don Evaristo! He's going to set him on fire! He's going to set him on fire! Isauro! Isauro! Isauro! Isauro! Here I am! Grandfather, please! You'll go to jail! Please, listen to me! It's good you brought him here. We're going to take care of him. - I can pay you rent. - That's not necessary. It would be like when my mother lived. Can I give you something, Don Isauro? Are you hungry? How will we talk to him? - How is he? - Good morning... ...I don't think he slept at all. Don Isauro... Don Isauro... Zikril, Martín, Zikril... What's wrong with him? Well, old age. But is he going to get better? We'll have to see how he evolves. But his lungs are pretty damaged, anyway. Martín... - ...he has to eat something. - Yes, thank you, I'll give it to him. Eat something, Don Isauro. I don't think he'll make it. - Let's take him to the hospital. - It's useless. He won't survive the drive to the hospital. Don Isauro is very sick. He has little time left and he wants to see you. Please come. A few days ago you were very happy, as friends. Please, come. - You know nothing. - Yes, I do. I know that you've had difficult lives, and very lonely... - ...and everything was unfair. - You're crazy! This is the last chance you'll have to say good-bye to Don Isauro. What else do you know? That Don Isauro never hurt your wife, and you have no reason to hate him. And you? Nothing. Please go say good-bye. You don't hate Don Isauro, the opposite in fact. Go say good-bye please! Please, come, Don Evaristo! Please open! Listen to me, open the door! He says he's coming. I'll let Fausto know. Martín... ...let him go. I don't understand... Don Isauro, what did you say? Go, Grandfather. Go to him. Go to him. I came to say good-bye. I think it would be good if you kept working with your grandfather. There's available budget... I want nothing to do with Zikril. As soon as I can, I'm leaving to the United States. I'm sorry. How is your grandfather? He won't talk to me. Where is he? I'd like to talk to him one last time. I am really sorry, Don Evaristo. Forgive me. I shouldn't have forced you. When Don Isauro was leaving, he said something like... ...jaide upive... ...upiveje... Do you know what it means? Just leave it. Thank you, Don Evaristo... Yes, that's it. What does it mean? Good-bye, my friend... ...my best friend. All that was unsaid... ...will remain unsaid... ...but in “The Enchantment” I will think about those things... ...and I will also think of you. My friend... ...my best friend. Good-bye.
