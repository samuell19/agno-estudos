- Oh no, I can't find my lunch! - Y-y-y-you can ha-ha-have my lunch. - Really, thank you! Do you wanna share? - Okay, thanks. - Don't you know how to talk? - No, she has marbles in her mouth! - Go away, she's my friend. That's a pretty locket you have on. - Ma-m-ma and d-daddy gave it to me. - My name's Hillary. What's yours? - I-I-Iris. M-m-my- n-name's Iris. - Oh. Like the flower. Best friends forever! - Come on! Don't do this to me, come on work! Not this morning! Oh my gosh. Work! Work! Stupid machine! Oh! No, no, oh! Oh, my new suit! Oh! Okay. Okay, hmm. What? No! Oh my gosh! Gross! Oh come on! What else? No, I want it fixed right now, Mister Irkson. Well, even the elevator is broken! Natalie McClay, who do you think? No, I know the appliances are new, that's exactly my point! Well, obviously, it's just another example of your shoddy construction. What? You're the one who hires people who can't even install a toaster! Idiot! This is Natalie. Yes sir. Yes, I have the Musser file right here. Yep, mmm-hmm, and the McGinnis remodel. Yes sir, I will make those changes right away. Bye. - So I worked on these for three days, and I stayed up all night last night getting them all in order by date. - I changed my mind, Kathleen. I want them sorted in alphabetical order and color code them. - Of course. Yes Ma'am. - Sixteen? - You wanna have dinner tonight, Sharon? - At the corner cafe? - You don't have time to eat. You have to be at the printers by six o'clock. Do not be late. And this, I got something on it at lunch. I need it to go to the dry cleaners. - The cleaners? - Yeah. - I was going to go to my grandmother's birthday party tonight. Or I can go to the cleaners and the printers and redo all the files. - What if the new roommate is an ax murderer? - Yeah, and she wears a hockey mask. - Nice! - Don't say that! - Oh relax, my friend recommended her. - Yeah, that's what worries me. - What did he say when you ran out of gas? - He said, "You were right. "We should have checked the tank before we went driving." Like I was right? Can I get that on record please? - Thanks for your help, guys. I got it. - Sorry. How did half of your stuff end up in my bags? - I'll run it down the hallway in a minute. Why do you need a new roommate anyhow? - Just how much do you think it costs for me to keep up my lifestyle? Hey, what if I made the new roommate a schedule? The meaning to life, a schedule. - Okay, come on guys it's not funny. Seriously this is my eighth roommate since Preston and I split up! - Oh, oh remember the one oh... She would snore so bad, she made like the room shake like an earthquake? - Yes. Caitlin! - Caitlin. - Then the hard-rocker Michelle. - I liked Michelle. Then next was, uh, Beth. She was an undercover spy. And then Gracie; you know, she got married. - To Kyle, isn't that always the way. - Don't forget about Marta Swan, always sneaking animals in. Four ducks, three dogs, two parrots with Russian accents! ♪ And a partridge in a ♪ - Okay. Listen, let's just hope the new roommate is dull. She could be here any minute. What if she's classier than I am? - Oh. What if she's an alien from outer space? Come on take, take control, shoulders back, chin up, tummy in. Show her you got moxie! - Put your foot down. Let her know what you expect first thing. - Right, first thing! I'll stand up to her. - Uh-oh. - Okay guys, let me handle this, all right? Moxie! Hi. I'm Natalie, Natalie McClay. Excuse me? I'm sorry I-- - Hi, I'm Iris Kreedle. You know I could barely fit my things through the door, since it's only two feet, 11 3/4 inches wide. Excuse me? - Oh what a place is this! Just so you know right up front, I like to watch certain paperback books and I always need at least 42 % of the universe on the coffee table. I'm sorry, universe? Oh, space. That's what it is, space. - It's space all right. I get universe and space mixed up sometimes. It's space I need. This will nicely do. - So, uh, Iris, is it? Well, this is Melanie and Laura. They live next door. - Oh I hope you don't mind if I put my paintings up. I love to paint. My great-grandfather had a song about painting, and it went like this. ♪ Oh paint your way to a bright new day ♪ ♪ If you're down, please don't frown ♪ - What planet is she from? ♪ Paint a star in the sky ♪ - I don't know. ♪ And your troubles will fly ♪ - A singing planet? - I'm really very flexible. I like hiking, and I like to eat seed flower suns to reduce tension. I'm usually up until about two o'clock in the morning. You don't mind do you? - Uh, seed-flower suns? - Good. Oh! You poor baby! You know, I have just the thing for you. ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na na - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm vocalizing to the plant. It's really biologically very scientific. You see singing will help it to grow again. Oh, and it will also enjoy my reggae music and my ragtime music, oh and of course my Irish music. It will get better; you just see and wait. What's the plant's name? - I... Name? - Don't tell me, you don't have a name for it? - Well, I mean... I just... I never... Well, I-- - Castrovinci! Let's name him Castrovinci! You know, I once knew a plant named Castrovinci, and he did very well, as I recall. A plant named Castrovinci? This is good, never in my wildest dreams. - Iris, would you like some coffee? - Coffee is not what she needs. - Here you go. - Oh, Iris doesn't drink coffee, only raspberry leaf tea. - I see. - Oh splendid. Is that a blue bedspread I see in there? I just love blue. it's my favorite color! - Oh no, Iris, no, it's my... It's my... My hope you'll be happy in my room. I just love my new room. - Welcome Iris. Nice to know you. - Thanks. It's so good to be home! - Oh, there she is! See I knew we'd find her. I told you she works at a bookstore! - What a surprise. Since we've already hit five bookstores, this was bound to be the one. - The bookstore looks a little mysterious to me. Do you think maybe she's like a detective or something? - A detective! In a bookstore? - Mmm-mm. - You never know. She is smart. She knows the mileage to anywhere. She says Paducah is 312.32 miles away. - Yeah, but she can't pronounce anything correctly. Oh guys, oh no! - Are you trying to kill us? - I couldn't let her see us! You know if she's so smart, how come she spends so much time at that little park anyway? - That's where she meets her informer. Oh, no! Oh wait, you think? - No. - Oh. - This is silly. Let's go in. - No! - Yeah, cover me. I'm going in. - No, Mel. No! - So Iris, you hike. Have you hit the A.T. yet? - Oh, I hiked the whole Appalachian Trail. 2,175 miles! Come on, I'll show you. We got hiking books, and gene-o-joli-gy books, and... Now where is that hiking book? You bathe once a week in town. On the trail, you can't shave, but you can almost braid your leg hair. - How lovely. - You see life in a whole new way. It's the naturalistic, beautified wonderment of God's country. That's hiking! Oh here it is. - The only thing Natalie knows how to hike around is the mall. - Hey, excuse me? - They have hiking at the mall? - Hey Iris, I really don't want my patio to become a greenhouse. - Oh sorry. - Hey, where did you go so early this morning? - Oh, I went to see my wise old owl. - Your wise old owl? - Uh huh. You talk to owls? - Huh? - Of course you do, goes right along with singing to plants! - Hey, would you like to come to my church with me sometime? It's amazing! - No thanks. Twice a year is boring enough. I mean, unless they have owls and plants there? - Uh, hey. We're $84 short. They're cutting off our electricity! - Sorry. - I'll give you the money you need. - No! Iris it's too much. Uh, we'll figure out something. - No problem. You need it, I have it. You take it, I give it. - Thanks, Iris. See you, Nat. - Why'd you do that? - She needed it. - $84! - 884, what makes the difference? - Oh. Oh. I think I'm allergic to your plants. - Oh. - Hey you like art, right? - Yes! - Let's go. - Dude, a ride like that makes you just wanna do some art? Yeah, sure. - Hey man, seriously. - Hey guys. - Nat, what's up? - So, uh, ready to meet the encyclopedia from the Happy Dale Sanitarium? This the 'cyclopedia? Oh, wow. - Iris, you know Mel. This is Jake, his sister Zelda, Charlie, Zeke, and that's Scrap. - Very pleasing acquainting with you. Oh motorized bikes. They go too fast for scenery. - Honey, if you think I'm gonna pedal my way to some scenery, you got another thing coming. - Yeah, buddy. Hey, you... You paint? - Uh huh! - Nice. Well, you've come to the right place. The kids art room is over there. This is Conner. Presenting my masterpiece. Yes! - Isn't it's awesome? - I sense such loneliness and depth of emotional loss! It's so sad! - She feels it. She really feels it! - Yes! - Wow! You're like totally intertwining with the art vibes in my head to find the hidden meaning of my painting. - This is deep! - Yeah, deeply hilarious! - Jake, did you paint this when you were incredibly sad? - How did you know? It was right after my father died. I felt so abandoned. - I know someone that can fill that emptiness and help you paint colorful pictures. - Really? You're like the first person I could really join art brain waves with. Wow! - Would you like to be looking at one of my paintings? - Whoa, you got a cool language there. No, seriously, I'd love to see it. - Yes! - Whoa, it's prodigious. Far beyond the realms of happiness! I sense joy in your red and yellow brush strokes, Iris. - You've got to be kidding me! - You don't understand art. It reminds me of my sister. It gets to me. - How does that remind you of your sister? - I've never seen anything like it. She'd love it. - Mel's little sister ran away a year or so ago, and it really drags her out. - She was 14 then. Dad drank too much, ran her off. - I'm feeling so sorry. I'll pray for your little sis. - Thanks. - Hey guys? I don't see anything but a picture. - That's 'cause your brain doesn't excel to the same level as us artists. - Well, that's a relief! - We artists stick together. We know emotions in art, don't we ISky? - I what? - ISky. Jakeo's the nickname master. - ISky it is then. - Nat. Nat! Iris is doing those birdman exercises in the produce section again. What? Someone might see her! - Oh relax. I might even join her! - Stop it Mel! Come on, you wouldn't dare! - Oh, you wanna bet? - I can't stay, I've got to get out of here! - Whoa! ♪ I sing because I'm happy ♪ ♪ I sing because I'm free ♪ - So she just freaked out and ran out of the store? Yeah. And then the whole way home in the car, she was like mumbling something about the music that was playing in the store, or I don't know. - Why? - Well, she wouldn't say. - Poor thing, she's got to have a reason. - I don't know, but it was bizarre. - I'm gonna save them this time! - Hey Iris, what's wrong? - Oh Hillary, I miss you. I'm dreaming about it again. - The fire dream? - Uh huh. I'm so sorry. Are you okay now? - Yeah. - Remember, best friends forever, so you're never alone. - I know. - I'm always here for you. - It helps just hearing your voice. - How's your new room mate? Hey Granddad. I really need to talk to my wise old owl today. - Well how's my little moon? - Well, sometimes my new friends get really mad and they make fun of my talking problem. - Well you hold your head up, love them, and pray, and they'll see Him in you. Iris, you are a true friend, and you have that treasure in you, and you want to share it. - Wow, you really are wise.

Huh, three main ingredients to a happy life. - Yeah but, I want someone to follow, someone to mold myself after. Someone who understands me and my need to be a size seven. - I want someone to follow down the path of life, to a pizza parlor. - Oh no, no, no! - I don't know. I'm waiting for someone you'd never expect to have the answers to life. - Oh, would you look at that? - Oh my gosh, you have got to be kidding me! Oh my gosh, you guys my brother just got a new car! I think it's really nice. Oh, and he's gone totally goofy over some girl! - You better stay out of it. All he needs is you messing it up for him! - Hi Iris. Hi. - More sunflower seeds? - Yep, and did you know that there's 2,562 seedflower suns in a one-pound bag? - Terrific, and I found another 152 of them in the couch! - Oops! - That's wonderful, Nat. You can be irritated and learning all at the same time. - I was talking to my Wise Old Owl. - Bet that was a one-sided conversation. Maybe you should try a parrot next time. They talk back you know. - M-m-my Owl does talk to me. Well, don't mind me, I'm going on a date tonight. Whoa, whoa whoa! Date? As in you're going out with someone? - Yes, date. - Oh wait, wait, you mean like with a man? - No, she means with a fruit. - Isn't it alright if I have dinner w-w-with-with a-a-a man? - Of course it is. - Well clearly you need help, and yeah obviously I'm the only one qualified to help you get ready for your date. Let's go. - But I thought I was ready. - Oh, this ought to be good. - Okay Iris. Here we go. Okay. Oh those have got to go. - I can't see very well! - Stop whining! Okay. Eyes first. Have to make the eyes pop. Hold still. Don't squeeze, just close, gently, gently. There you go. See the first thing a guy notices is your eyes. Uh, okay. Let's see. Hmm. Alright next. Hold still! It's not an instrument of torture. There we go. Alright. Now a little color on the lips. Okay. You know this is actually made of whale blubber. - Eeww! - Alright so... Oh, that's no good. And that too. There we go much better, see? Where have I been all your life? Alright, just need a little bit of this. And there we go. Oh. Alright, it's going to be harder than I thought. - What are you doing? - Ooh! Ssh! Iris is going on a date! Natalie's in there making her up, and they've been in there for several hours. - I thought she was married to God or something. - I don't know. Please! But, you know, she does memorize words and numbers from this book. - Must be a pretty interesting book. - To Iris, the Bible is a really big deal. - For Iris, yeah, everything's a big deal. I mean the sun shines, and she's thrilled. A bird chirps, and she's thrilled. She's elated by the fact that she's breathing air. - Yeah, that's how us artists roll. Right on. - Okay guys. Go, go. There you go, okay. Everyone, presenting the new Iris. Iris? - Hi. - Iris they are over here. - Oh. - We had to lose the glasses. - I mean, wow, Iris, you... You look awesome. - Thanks. - Pretty rad, Iris! Whoo, legendary. - It's my creation. Not bad if I do say so myself. - I thought God created Iris. - Well, I just helped Him out a little. Okay Iris, have fun tonight. - Okay, bye-bye. - Don't you tell him you talk to owls. - Wow! - She looks good, looks good. - You lemon or anti-lemon? - I'm pro lemon, please. - My pleasure. My name's Corbin if you need anything else. - Thanks. He's funny. Wow this is fantastical, it's captivating. - Nat-lie, you got any food? - Sorry no poison junk food here, Malomar. - That's Melamotor! - Wonder if Iris's guy has thick rimmed glasses with a shaved head? - Hey, some of my best buds have shaved heads! - You guys hang on, I forgot something! - Your brain? - What would her brain be doing in the drawer? - It has been missing for some time. - Okay, this letter for Iris came from North Carolina a couple days ago. - Then what are you doing with it? - I just thought it might tell us something. - You opened Iris's mail? I didn't open it, so to speak. I steamed it, and it just opened itself! - Unbelievable! - What? What are you all flipping out about? - Because you're infringing on the property of an innocent person! - She's infringing? Sounds serious. - Oh, you don't even know what that means. - It's okay, Jake. She's the idiot. Opening somebody else's mail is a federal offense. - I'm with Mel on this one. - Oh, get over yourself. - Remember that little boy I was working on? - Yes, I remember him. - I thought he would never walk again. I asked God to help him, and in three weeks he was walking! Soon he won't even have to use his leg braces! Blew me away. - Wow. God gave you a miracle. It's so refreshable to know a doc who's not afraid to ask God to heal. - I'm never afraid to ask that. - Thank you for being my friend. - A... This is for you. - Aww, thanks. I love it! I want to give you something too, something to remind you of me. My Granddad Al carved it for me. - The moon, huh? - Mmm hmm. - I like how you don't let society dictate to you. You're original, different. - You're a different original too, Dr. Jordan Blake. - My heart is so, so fully intact with you. - I'm, enriched in your presence. Wow. I even talk better when I'm around you. - The letter is from Iris's aunt. Totally explains her weirdness, you know. Apparently she suffered a childhood trauma. - I don't want to hear this. This is private information! - Oh, I'll hear private information. - Uh, You will not! - Settle down. Now, listen. When Iris was little, she was rescued from her burning house. - Let me go! Let me get Mommy and Daddy! - Somebody's getting them, honey. - She lost her entire family. After that her aunt raised her. - No! No. - Her aunt was somewhat deaf, and she didn't speak very well. - So, that explains why she talks a little funny, huh? - She kept Iris pretty isolated. - Poor thing. She was doing the best she can, and we were making fun of her! - Yeah, I feel so terrible. - Why do you feel terrible? - Because you were making fun of her! - And, uh, how did you know all this stuff? - Why, I read it in her journal and these newspaper clips. You read her journal, too? - Aww man, wow! - Hush, just to learn about her. She got stuck back at the time of the trauma, stunting her emotional and mental maturity. It's fascinating. - What is wrong with you? - Oh relax, she'll never know. - I bet God knows. And he may tell her too. - Well... I mean, I mean you guys aren't going to tell her, right? - Yeah, I'm telling her. Well, unless, you promise to go hiking with her like she wanted. Oh no way! I am not going to go traipsing around after some lunatic through the barbaric, forsaken wilderness! - Iris, uh, did you know that Natalie-- - Is, is, is, uh, going to go, hiking with you! - For real? - Mm hmm! - That's stellar-a-cious! - Hey, uh, like where's the dude? Zeke? - Oh, wait. Wait no. It's not him, right? No tell me, it's not him? - Not who? - No, not none of yous. Come here you guys. - Ugh, must they? - Iris went on a date. - Hey, did you know that Zeke's a Bible name? - What are you talking 'bout? - Yes, it says in Ezekiel 36:26 that God gives you a soft heart, not one of stone. ♪ Ezekiel saw a wheel ♪ ♪ Way up in the middle of the air ♪ - Wheels? Riding in the air? Sounds pretty awesome! ♪ Riding in the air, the air, the air, the air ♪ - Okay. So, Iris, how was your date? Oh, don't tell me, it went badly. - It, it was really-- - I mean, he didn't even drive you home! - But, but it, it was great. - Too bad, must have been a clunker. - No, I don't think clunker was the brand. It started with a P. Po ... Uh, you know like that, that, that part that's on the front of a house? It's a porch, that's the brand, Porch! - You mean, Porsche? - Wait, hold on a second. A man with a Porsche took you out? - He has! I love it! - Are there other men with Porsche's in your religion? - It ain't got nutting to do with that! - It's not religion. There's a big difference between religion and relationship. It's about love. - Yeah That's it! Relationship, not religion. How heavy, man. - Iris! What have you done to this place? - It's great, huh? And I'm not even done yet. I'm gonna put lots of flowers and plants everywhere. It's gonna be beautiful. It's gonna be a great roof garden. I'm even gonna put an archway! - No, you-- - And then lots of little lights. And an art studio, so I can do more paintings for the kids at the shelter. - What shelter? I'm sorry, I'm totally not following you. - Oh, that's right. I better get going, or I'll be late for my new job there. Bye-bye. - Just how many jobs do you have? So, apparently, he makes this fantastic duck, and he's opening a new restaurant here in town. - Wow! Would you look at that! The moon is majestical. It reflects the sun you know. Well, of course, I know that. - I want to be the moon reflecting the Son, a different sun, God's son. - Yeah, when you reflect the son, the full spectrum of artistic colors shine through you. That's some savvy profoundness right there, Moon. - I thought she was ISky? Well, you cook profoundly, Isky Moon! - Well, it's no Beef Bourguignon or Creme Brulee like my gourmet cooking teacher, John would make, but... - Don't think I want any beef barbarian or cram burley, okay? You know, Mel hates your cooking. - Well, that's just because street people don't have the civilized taste buds acquired by the cultured side of the world. - You and your stuck up taste buds! That's it! You know, bye bye Prissy Gourmet! So long It's All About Me magazine! - Mel, you wouldn't dare! - Oh, wouldn't I! Watch me! - No! - Strawberries anyone? - Hey guys! Who wants purple? Brighton? - Sure, thanks. - Iris, do you remember my first time here? - Oh yes. You yelled, and cussed and stomped! - I'm sorry, but I'm glad you put up with me. - Aww, I knew you were special. David, too. It's just you've been through a lot, that's all. - You've given me a hope to believe in. You're my best friend. - Mine too, Iris. - Aww guys, you're so special. You're all special. We're God's children, but you're my treasured children too! You're my flowery bunches. I love you very much, and Dylan and Shauna, and every last one of you! - Some of Justin's photos are in here. I think he's on a special photo shoot in Africa. - I don't think he's in Africa. I saw him downtown near his old studio. - You saw him and didn't tell me? You're still in with love him, aren't you? There's hope then. - So what, you're a counselor now too? - Uh, yes. I counseled people. That was right after my job as a florist. - You can't have been every occupation! - Well, she can make plants come back to life. - Yeah. So, are you experienced in sanitation engineering? - Uh... I don't think I know what that means. - Oh, well, it means clean up the dishes, I'm expecting someone! - Oh, okay. - That's a good girl. - Quit ordering her around! I'll help, Iris. Way to go, Nat. - Yeah, perfect name, Gnat, with a G! - Whatever, I don't have time for this. Hunter's going to be here any minute, and I'm not even ready yet. - Who'd date you? - You're not Hunter? - Name's Mack, Mack Waters, plumber at your service. - What? Now? Oh, perfect timing! Mr. Irkson said he'd fix that sink weeks ago! - Ma'am are there two sinks in the bathroom? - No, just the one. - Landlord said there were two. Are there two sinks in the apartment? - Well yes, there's the kitchen and then... Well, what does that have to do with the bathroom sink? - Nothing unless the kitchen sink's in the bathroom. - Of course not. - Is the kitchen sink clogged up too? - There are two women right there washing dishes in it! - How are they washing dishes in it if it's clogged up? - The kitchen sink isn't clogged up, you idiot, it's the bathroom sink! - Okay calm down, lady, I'll take a look. This way. I got it. I don't know... Uh Nat? - Idiot! How? - What's this? - My name is Jorge Francisco. I'm here to fix the light. Mr.Irkscum sent me. - I think you mean Irkson. - I think you mean Jerkson. Whoa, hey whoa. Hey, where are you going there buddy? - I'm going to the bedroom. - Uh, no way Buster, you are not going in my room! It's busted I know. I'm gonna fix it in the bedroom. - No, no, no, Buster! - My name is Jorge Francisco, not Buster. - I don't care if your name is James Bond! There's no reason for you to go in my bedroom! - There's where the light is broken, lady! - No, the light is in the kitchen! - I'm Stan. Stan the telephone man. Uh huh. - Uh huh? - Are you going to let me in? Your landlord Mr. Irkstone sent me to fix, fix your phone. - Oh, our landlord's Irksome. - I'm sorry. Well, come on in. Ahh, what now? - I'm Stan, the telephone man, uh-huh. - Okay. Okay, there has to be a mistake because there definitely is nothing wrong with our... You're kidding me! - Huh, well there is now. I'll fix it for you. - Whatever. - It was making crackling noises earlier. - Oh that wasn't the phone, that was Nat'lie's souffle. Thank you, Mr. Telephone man, Stan. - You're welcome. - Why is Mr. Irkson sending all these people over here when Hunter's coming? - Who's Hunter? - Hunter Stanford III, her date. Another unconscious consumer. - Okay, you shut up, and you Mr. Telephone Man Stan, fix that phone and do it quickly! - Yes, ma'am. - Oh I'll get it, it's probably Hunter. - Whoever he is, I hope he's worth all your ranting and raving! ♪ Oh only mine, ♪ ♪ It's Pizza Romando's ♪ ♪ Finest ingredients', ♪ ♪ $9.59 ♪ - We didn't order pizza!

Okay so, so no one ordered pizza? - I could use a pizza, but it can't have any anchovies on it, or Thelma won't kiss me when I get home. Does it have any anchovies on it? - No, it's a pepperoni pizza. - Because if it does-- - Shut up! Nobody asked you, Stan! And you, no one ordered pizza! Idiot! - You stomping on my pizza!

Jordan was my date! - Zero! - Blastoff! - Blastoff! - Wait, you went out with my brother? - Yes. - Why? - Because I asked her. - I'm sorry. You asked her? Iris? - Yes, I happen to like her very much, thank you. - Oh gosh! Oh, oh this can't be happening. - She's freaking out. - Okay. Oh my gosh, it's not possible. - Oh, she doesn't look so good. - Oh no. - I don't feel so good. Oh! Someone get some water, quick! - Natalie. Natalie? - Hunter? Oh, those for me? Hi Iris. - I'm waiting here, 'cause Jordan's coming with a surprise for me! - Sweetie listen, I talked to Jordan. - Uh huh? - And it's just... He's just very angry at how you embarrassed me yesterday. - What? - He wanted me to tell you, he doesn't want to see you anymore. - But, but that can't be, I mean how could he? - He's not coming. Surprise. - Wow, that was close. - Yeah, that was close. - Have you seen Iris? - She's not gonna show. - Why? - She wants you to stay away from her. - No. She said that? - Mmm-hmm. She hopes you'll respect that and not bother her. - No, it can't be! - I'm sorry. I'll see you later. Hillary, thank you for coming to see me. - I'm really worried about you. I've never seen you like this. - I'm fine. - Iris, I know you better than that. - How are the kids? - The kids are fine. But I came here to make sure that you're fine. Iris, tell me what to do? - Just be here close, like sisters. - I'm right here, Sissy. I'm right here. - I love you, Hillary. - I love you too, Iris. - Charlotte, good news! You're going home tomorrow! - What? You've got to be kidding me! I'm on my last leg here. And I could collapse and die at any minute! - Charlotte, you could have hurt Joanie! - Oh. - Help me! I gotta get outta here! - Hello, Teila. - Hi, Iris, how's my favorite volunteer? - I'm terrifical. It's great to see you. - Guess who's back? - The hypochondriac. - Again? - Again. - Well, I'll see what I can do. Dr. DeVoe needed in O.R., Dr. DeVoe. - That Iris, I just love her. - Yeah. Honey, ain't nobody like Miss Iris. She'd give you the moon, if she had it. - I'm so glad you started working here. She's in rare form today. - Okay. Hi Charlotte. You know you really should go on that cruise. It would make you feel better. - Only cruise I'm going on is in a casket. - Oh, now look what I brought you. Your favorite, chocolate chip cookies! - I like peanut butter! - Peanut butter. They're really good though, you should try them. Now let me see... Where did we leave off? Wasn't it Book of John? Yes. He's anointed me to bring good news to the hurting. I like photos that make happy memories, Mr Taylor. - Well Iris, happy memories are my business. And you can just call me Justin. - Iris, are you ready to... What are you doing here? - You know, I think I might ask you the same question. - I thought I was having dinner. - And I thought I was photographing someone! I wasn't expecting dinner. - I wasn't expecting you! - Laura. Justin. - No need to go out for music when you've got old Baxter. - Yeah. Iris said one of her prayers with Jaysee the other day. She made her laugh! - Jaysee laughed? That's awesome! - Yeah. - You know, it's, it's like ISky knows something we don't, like some kinda secret. - You know this kind of reminds me of the Italian cafe I took you to when we first met. - Yeah, you kept clearing your throat. - Well, I was nervous, you know. I sounded like a frog. - The moon was bigger than the sky that night. We danced outside, and you told me my eyes looked as big as flying saucers. - Well you know me, I've always had a way with words. Hmm. - You know, I guess, Laura, there's really no hiding it. I still have feelings for you. You know, life was just getting in the way and it was ripping us apart. Tell me that when you saw me tonight you didn't feel anything? Laura, look at me. Tell me you don't still love me. This is all happening so fast. - Oh, Jordan. - Troy! - Hi, Iris. Look how fast I can go. - Wow! - Guess what, Iris? - What? - Dr. Blake said I don't even need leg braces anymore! - Oh let me see. That's fantastical, Troy! - Leave me alone to die, you, you wardrobe challenged, anomaly! - You know, no one has to know how much you actually do like me. - He has! - Look what I brought. - Do they have bingo on that cruise? - Yep, and a 24-hour buffet. - I don't think so. - Yes, it's true! You know you're really looking good today, Charlotte. - Let me ask you something. Why have you been so nice to me when I've been so mean to you? - Aww, because you needed to know that He loves you and can give you life. - Thanks for not giving up on me. - Never gave up, so you can't either. - Do you think they might have snorkeling on that cruise? - I bet they do! - Iris, I cannot believe you got Laura and Justin back together again. And here I thought I'd be the one moving out first, and I wouldn't be needing a new roommate! - There's a reason for it, God knows. - What? What'd I do now? - Tick tock, baby, tick tock! - Are we late for Iris's concert deal? - You're late alright, but not to any concert. Men are clueless. You're talking about marriage, huh? - Yeah, you're catching on, Iris. - I told you, I'll get around to it okay? You got the sodas? - Yeah, I got the sodas. You got the basket? - Let's go, Iris. ♪ We will stand ♪ ♪ In a sinking sand ♪ ♪ On Christ the solid rock we will stand ♪ ♪ We'll climb on your back ♪ ♪ Take us to higher ground ♪ ♪ Woo, yeah ♪ ♪ Woo, yeah ♪ ♪ Woo, yeah ♪ ♪ Woo, yeah ♪ All other ground is sinking sand! - Iris has a regular amped up gig! - Wow, let's hear it for Iris Kreedle and the Lifeline Band! - Thank you! - The Shelter Benefit, aww, this is, this is so outstanding that we can do this. They're big, but you have a small surprise too, correct? - Yes, I have a small surprise, thank you Jerry. I have a very special friend here with me, my friend, Brighton Kaleti! Let's hear it for her!

How many of you know Hillary Bachtel? Iris's friend? Hillary's here. Hillary come on out, let's hear it for Hillary! - When we were kids in school, I didn't have a lunch, and Iris gave me hers. So, in honor of Iris, my company has agreed to provide healthy meals for the shelter kids every day. - Iris, your life means so much to so many. I love you. - Oh, thank you, I don't know what to say. Oh wow! I love you too, Hillary. Well, thank you guys for coming. Thank you so much, and you all have a cheery day. Godspeed! - Morgan? Morgan! - Mel? - Morgan! - I can't believe it! - Morgan! Oh, I thought I'd lost you! You're alive, you're okay! Do you know how worried I've been? Oh, and all these images in my head about what's happened to you the past year. - I'm so sorry. I would have told you I was okay, but I couldn't risk Dad finding me. - Morgan! Wow, it's Morgan! Aww, missed you! - Morgan is your sister? - Iris, you know Morgan? Oh! I've missed you so much. - At the shelter, Iris even helped me stop stuttering. She took care of me. - You've been in good hands. Thank you, Iris. You've given me a gift I will never forget. - Oh. It's spectaculus! - Where else have you been, Morgan? - Well, I was afraid Dad would find me, so I moved around. Then I was doing a favor for someone, and I got into some trouble. - You better stop little girl! - Leave me alone! - I will catch you, and it won't be pretty! I told you I'd find you! Be a good kid and gimme my stuff. It's all here. I didn't know it was drugs Mel, I promise. They told me it was invoices I was delivering. What do you think? - Whoa, whoa. - So get this, Iris promised the cop she would take care of me for the night. - What's the scoop Iris? - You see, I was going down the back alley passing out meals, when all of a sudden, these two rushed by, and I followed them, and I overheard everything. The drugs are his, Officer Logan. - Okay. Take her. - She took me to the shelter and even fed me dinner. Turns out this amazing person saved my life. Iris knows everybody! Wow. That's a really awesome painting! - Iris painted it. It reminds me of you. - It can be your welcome home present. - Really? Thank you! - I don't need to look for a new roommate, because you've given me the best roommate I could have! - Iris! Iris! Stop singing that infernal song! You drive me crazy! Why do you always have to sing Jesus songs? - Because I love Him. He gave His life for us. He makes me happy and free. - You ruined my chances with Hunter. Seeing me drenched like that, I was mortified! - But he said he'd come back later. - Oh, yeah. Probably much later. Gosh, I'm just, I'm sick of your, your cooking that everyone loves, and your singing, and your paintings, and you're sleeping in my room! - What? You didn't tell me. - Well, how could anyone tell you? You're always talking, Ms. Happy-go-lucky. - Don't you like to be happy, Nat'lie? - No! Well, I mean of course. I just don't have to go around dripping smiles all over everyone. And while we're at it, look at this, your blasted seedflower suns! Sunflower seeds! See, you're turning me into a lunatic too! On the floor, in the couch, everywhere! You think you're on this mission from God Iris, but you're just a mess! - Sorry, I'll be cleaning them, Nat'lie. - It's not Nat'lie, it's Nat-a-lie! And do you know what happened to me yesterday? I found a sunflower seed in my hair! - I, I didn't be meaning to-- - I'm not finished! You want 42 % of the coffee table, so stop taking up 75 % of it! Don't you know that these, these are the most important things in my life! You've turned my exquisite loft and the roof into this cozy, cluttered dive! And I can't stand your weird clothes. You're a freak, Iris! - I didn't know you felt this way. What's really wrong, Nat-a-lie? - Jordan loves you. Everyone loves you! God only knows why? - Jordan? - Well, I mean, you know, he used to. - How can I help you? Help me? Who talks to owls and sings to plants? - The only owl I talk to is my granddad, Albert Maximillian Fred Patton. Oh, well, amazing. He's actually a real person. You and your always helping, do you think it does any good? - But it saves lives and saves hearts. - Oh, so now you're a mender of broken hearts. - No I'm not, but Jesus is. - Look, for every person you help, there are millions more who need it. It makes no difference whatsoever. - But it makes a difference for that one. - Gosh, I just, I really hate you! Just go away! No. No. No, I don't hate you. I hate myself. - How can you say that about yourself, Nat-a-lie? - You'd hate me too, if you knew. - But God will forgive you, if you ask Him to. He's not up there holding a big stick. He wants you to know Him. It's not good people that go to heaven, it's forgiven people that do. - Well, I don't deserve His forgiveness. - Oh no one does, but He does it anyway. - Maybe. The thing is... You haven't heard what I've done. That day at the park, Jordan did come to meet you. I lied. I told him you didn't want to see him anymore. - Why, you knew I loved him. - Yes, and he loved you. I didn't want you to be together. And I read the letter from your aunt. - You did? Why would you do that? - I just... I steamed it open and read it. Pretty tricky, huh? And there's more. I, um ... I read your newspaper clips and your journal. - So, you know all about me now. - Say something. Iris? - You hurt your own brother? No. No. I, I didn't want anybody to know about the fire. I... No. I can't be remembering. It's, it's... People ask questions and questions, and I have to explain m-m-my talking problem. I was making a new life. I was making a new life. I was, I was making a new life. It's all gone now! Not the fire! Get away from the fire! No! No, no not the fire! Help! Help! No, get out of the fire! Not the fire! I've got, I gotta save them! I've got to save them! I've got to help them! - Okay, look at me, listen. There's no fire. Iris it's gone, there's no fire. There's no fire, okay, it's gone. It's gone. Iris, you were just a little girl. It's not your fault. ♪ Keep talking and you're never coming home ♪ - God, help me! - Iris! Open the door! I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Hey Nat, wake up sleepyhead. - Hmmm? Oh, hey. Where's Iris? - Isn't she in her room? What's up with your hair? - She's gone. None of her stuff is here; her clothes are gone. - Oh, what'd you do to her? - Oh stop it. - Her paintings are gone! - What did you do to her? - What are you going to do, comb me to death? - What did you do to mess with my art buddy, ISky, huh? - Nat, talk to us? - Nat, spill it! - I told her I read her letter and journal. - You what? - I know, and, and then she just flipped out, and she started stuttering and had this sort of mental meltdown. It was pretty scary. - She better be okay, you moron! After all she's done for us? - I know. I'’m gonna go look for her. - Oh no you're not! You have done enough! Give her some space. - Really? - Guys. Laura! What am I going to do? - Jordan! - Oh, hey. - Hey, have you seen Iris? She moved out a couple days ago. - I'm the last person she'd want to see. - What do you mean? - Well, she told Natalie that she did not want to have anything to do with me. - What? - That's what Natalie said. - That's what... That's what Natalie said? - That's what she said. - I gotta go. - Okay, see you. - She's hasn't eaten in two days, or gone to cooking class! - Ooh, now that could be serious. - I've never seen her place look this bad before. She hasn't even changed clothes. - Yeah. Look. She's even starting to collect some dust. - Nat. Nat? - Hey. - You know how I always teased her about talking to owls and singing to plants? I found out the owl is her Granddad. - I told you she had reasons for things. - The laughter was because of Iris. I even miss her seed flower suns! - You idiot! Either I'm going to kill you or you're going to wish I had! Call Jordan right now and tell him the truth, you heinous liar! - Whoa, Melamotor. Chill babe, come on! - What? - You know what! Jordan didn't dump Iris, you broke them up, you vile snake! - Guys, guys, guys! - Chillax, come on, chillax! - Iris could be in real trouble! Look what I found in the park! That's Iris's phone! - Oh no! - Alright, listen up, Jordan you go to the shelter. Laura, Justin, Nat's apartment, church, pizza, grocery store, meet in the art studio. Everybody good? Let's go. - Hey Noel. - Hey. - Have you seen Iris? - No. - Have you seen her anywhere? Hasn't been here. - Dear God, where is she? What's happening to me, Granddad? - Come have a seat. - I thought she was my friend. - Well Iris, this is the situation. God has brought you to this point for such a time as this. You are the only one that has the answers to help these people. You have a call that only you can do. - You're right. I love you bigger than the sky. Never forget, I love you bigger than the sky world, Granddad. - You know, I thought I just might find you up here. - You, you were looking for me? - You don't know what it did to me when I couldn't find you! - Sorry, I didn't mean to. - You're turning me inside out. I'm in love with you. - Oh my. - Mel, what's up? Hey Melamotor. - Hey Babe. - You gonna talk with us or what? - I was listening to Grateful Dead. - Nice. Nice! Too bad Jerry Garcia had to die. - Yeah. - A moment of silence, please. - Didn't he die a long time ago? - August 9th, 1995. - At 4:23 a.m. - At 4:23 a.m. - It seems just like yesterday. Show some respect! - Hey look who I found? - Iris! We've been holding our breath! - ISky-Moon! Aww man, now I can breathe. - You're a funny man, Jakester. - Jakester? Listen to this? Now she's got a nickname for the Nickname Master! Jakester. Not bad! - What means this? - I hope you don't mind. I've been trying to take care of your plants for you, you know until you came for them. - No, I don't mind at all. Thanks. - It's no problem. Uh... I can arrange to have someone pick them up and take them to your Granddad's for you if you want. - No, I think I like them better here. You didn't even kill them. - I figured out the secret. It turns out if you sing to them, it actually makes them grow. - Really? - Yeah. - I miss this place so much. Can I still come back? - What? Of course! So you forgive me? - Yeah. I forgive you all day long and at night time too. - Thank you, Iris. You're welcome. - God, you know, people everywhere love you, Iris. I want what you have. - Well it's, it's just a relationship with Him, that's what it is. - He really listens and cares, huh? - Yep, He sticks closer than a brother. - Thanks for helping me, even though I was being a jerk. I see why you like it up here. It's so peaceful. It's beautiful. - Yep, you can see everything clearer up here on the roof. - Let's go get your things. now you're moving back in. - Okay. What would you think if I used my bathroom to raise different breeds of caterpillars? We'd have live butterflies all over the house! - Want to check out the new Thai place? - Ooh, that sounds really good. - Oh what about pizza, let's go get some pizza. - Yes! - It's always pizza with you. - It's always pizza with me! We gotta go, now! - Wow, are you that hungry? Let's go. - Come on! - There's more kids in there. I'm going back in! - No Iris, you can't! It's too dangerous! - Noel, I've got to do this. Dear Lord, please help me save them this time. - No, Iris stop! Help! Help! - Help me! - Help! - Where are you guys? - Iris! - Come on, come on, go, go! Go, hurry! - Hi, sorry. Is there anybody still inside, is everybody okay? - There's some more children inside. Iris went in to get them. I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't listen. - What? No! Iris? Iris! Iris, where are you? - Over here. - Where? - Here. - What? - No, get out! - I can't, Iris, I can't, I can't feel my legs! You have to go. Go get-- - Natalie, look at me. I am not leaving without you. It's going to be okay. I've got you. oh, thank God you're okay, that was a close call! - You were... You were amazing! - I've got her, I've got her. Where's Morgan? - Isn't she with Mel? David, where's Morgan? - I don't know! - Morgan! - Iris wait, Iris! - No, Iris! - Morgan! Morgan, are you in here? I didn't know where else to go. It's okay honey, don't worry I've got you. Now! - Morgan! - Morgan! - Morgan! - Jake! Morgan! - There she is! - Morgan! Oh Morgan! Morgan, we didn't know you were in there! - Dear God! - Thank God you're okay, baby! - Iris found me and-- - Where's Brighton? - Iris? - Brighton? - ISky!-No, no! - There's Iris. - Iris, Iris, oh no, don't go back inside. No! - ISky! After fire engines had arrived on the scene. Onlookers apparently saw smoke and flames engulfing what used to be the homeless shelter in Cascade Park. - What? - No information is available at this time. Come on, come on! What! - Where is she? - No, no! - Look I'm a doctor. - I can't let you in, it's too dangerous! - Let me in! - Jordan! - Iris, where are you? Iris! Oh no! Iris, hey Iris! Help! Somebody help! Help! Somebody help me! - How's is she? - Lungs damaged. Too much smoke. - I need to see her. - Okay. This way. Come on guys. Oh my gosh. Oh, this isn't happening. Hey Iris. It's Nat'lie. Please wake up. Open your eyes! - Baby, please. Nothing's right without you. - Iris we need you. I need you. You are the best friend I ever had. I love you. - I love you, Iris. - Laura, she's okay, right? She's okay, right? No! No! Iris! Nothing will ever be the same again. - It's only been a week. As crazy as it sounds, I know she was right about what she believed. - You know I understand now what Iris was talking about when she was always saying how Jesus laid down His life for us. I mean that's what she did for Morgan and for me. I just wish I could've... I mean if we just had... Guys, I mean, do you realize how afraid of fire she was? - She cared more about us than her fears. Don't you get it? She made sure she saved her family this time. You know? I feel so empty. I mean I feel so helpless! - We know where her help came from. It's right here. I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from where my help comes. My help comes from the Lord. You know I woke up late one night, and I found Iris. She was sitting right here, and she was looking out the window, and just laughing at the moon. It was that child-like innocence of hers just trusting in God, her father. At that moment, I realized who she really was, and who I could become. - The moon. - She was the moon, a reflection of the Son. - She gave her life for us every day. Not just in the end. - Why does there have to be an end? I mean, gosh, it's just... I just, I want to hit a wall until my hand hurts so that I don't have to feel this pain in my chest anymore. No. I've got a better idea. I know what I have to do. I'm going to stop worrying about if my house is perfect. I'm so tired of the emptiness of living only for myself. God, I wish she knew I've changed! - She knows. She knows. Where are you going? - I'm going to the shelter. I wanna see if we can rebuild it and restart Iris's kids program. I want, to plant this Iris and Jasmine there in her honor. I want to carry on with what she started. - What can we do? - Come with me. Natalie took up where Iris left off! All because Iris showed us God's love, gave us hope, treated us with dignity. That love just spread around like gravy, it did. Iris not only understood the deeper meaning of my art, but helped me to understand the meaning of life, to know God. Relationship, not religion. How heavy man. I'm even painting happy pictures again, wow! Iris asked God to give me my Morgan back. She taught me to let love soften my heart. A great love. His love. Iris taught me about the mark between the dates. Your very own time line, the gift God gives you. What you do with it is the gift you give back to Him. She made a difference with her mark, and I will too, now that I have a father, a Heavenly Father. He's always with me, and so is she. Iris taught me nothing's impossible with God. The Lord touched people everywhere through Iris. Charlotte did go on that cruise with her husband. We've all changed, especially Nat. She even promoted her assistant, Kathleen, who came to help. - If God hadn't brought Iris, I wouldn't have known how to care about people. My life was saved on so many levels. All because she introduces me to a VIP, the creator of the universe! Oh, thank you all so much for coming out today to help us dedicate this place, The Iris Place. May it be a place where people come to find the love of their Savior, just like we did, and just like Iris taught us. - Words could never express the love that she brought, or how much I miss her. But one day very soon, we'll be together forever. - A moment of silence please, for ISky. Iris was the love of my life, the most unique, different original I ever met. I miss her every day. She's taught me the true meaning of God's sacrificial love. - Amen. ♪ Paint your way ♪ ♪ To a brand new day ♪ ♪ When you're down ♪ ♪ Please don't frown ♪ ♪ Paint a star in the sky ♪ ♪ And your troubles will fly ♪ ♪ Paint your way ♪ ♪ To a brand new day ♪ ♪ If you're down ♪ ♪ Please don't frown ♪ ♪ Paint a star in the sky ♪ ♪ And your troubles will fly ♪ - I'll see you when I get there, Iris.
