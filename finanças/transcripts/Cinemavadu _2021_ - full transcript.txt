-[♪♪] -Siddu, stop! Listen to me, Siddu... Siddu... Sorry, Siddu! Please forgive me! Please don't leave me. Hear me out, please. Please forgive me, Siddu. I did a grave mistake. It's ok, Kavya. Even I did a mistake. What did you do, Siddu? Trusting you! Cut it... Super, Siddu! You both did a great job. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Thank you so much. You conceived a great scene, bro. You'll be a star director in the future. [♪♪] [scooty horn] -You are late! -Sorry! Cute! -Hey... -Huh? Why are you so tensed? Be cool. Most importantly, perform with confidence. Ok? Done. Ok, congratulations. What for? You got a call from the producer, right? He'll love your story for sure. You'll come to me right away with the happy news. I have to congratulate you anyway, right? So I did it in advance. I don't know why, I feel tensed, Riya. Now you look perfect. You look so handsome. I might jinx it! I trust you. Everything will go as you thought it would. Ok? -Bye. -Bye. Ok, go. -Have one. -No, sir. I don't smoke. One day you will. Show me your hand. -What for, sir? -Come on. You are a lucky man, Karthik. -Why did you say so, sir? -Your story... Both producer and the hero loved it. Really, sir? Why would I lie to you? They read your entire story. You penned down exactly what they are looking for. I took care of everything. They'll pay you 5 lakhs for the story. Is that ok? Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. -But... -Sir? You won't get credits for the story. Director will. You have nothing to do with this story. I didn't get you, sir. Did you ever hear the word 'Ghostwriting'? Sir... You are the one who will be writing. But someone else will get the credits. You might find it strange and new. But this is very common and old in the industry. Sir... I worked for many months on this script, sir. Karthik... As I know you well, I am at least being able to get you paid. If this is someone else... They'll complete the movie even without the knowledge of the writer. In that case, you won't even get the money or the credits. You are at least getting paid. It's just one story, Karthik. If you concentrate again, you can write many more. Industry won't open its gates so easily. Once it does... ...you have to barge in somehow. Sir, it's ok even if you don't pay me. But I want the credits, sir. This story is like my baby, sir. How can I leave without credits, sir? One thing is clear, Karthik. They are ready to give you money. Not the credits. Listen to me and sell them the story. I'll make them pay one more lakh. Sir, if I agree with what you said... It's like agreeing that I'm not the father of my son, sir. I can't do it, sir. Every topmost director in the industry has ghostwriters. If all of them think that they need credits as you do... Half of the movies will never make it out of the books. If I have to speak it in your tongue... Life will give you hundreds of reasons for a downfall. But only one opportunity to raise high. People like you will fall for hundreds of times. But will never raise at least once. I was trying to help you and you don't even care. [♪♪] I trust you. Everything will go as you thought it would. THE FILM MAKER -Karthik... -Yeah, Riya, tell me. I have to leave early for the office. Can you prepare lunch and pack some for me? Yeah, I will. Hey... We have dinner plans tonight, ok? Celebrating my promotion. So I planned a small party with my colleagues. Come home early. We can go together. I don't think I'm needed at the party, Riya. You go. I have narrations with some producers. Whatever plans you have... Complete them before six. See you in the evening. Bye. I left some money on the fridge. Take it. -Hey, hi. -Sir. So... Karthik... Karthik Teja, right? -Yes, sir. -Tell me, what we got here! -It's a science fiction story, sir. -Good. It also has a feel-good love story as the sub-plot, sir. Ok. -Shall I start, sir? -Yeah yeah, sure. So, the thing is Karthik... If I don't find that vibe in your story, right... We are not doing this film. -Yeah? Is that clear? Go ahead. -Ok. The opening shot in on an empty road, sir. -A man is walking down the road. -Ok. The camera is in the dutch angle, sir. As it moves-- Karthik, let me tell you this... All this Telugu thing no... It just doesn't get into my mind. So, could you do this whole thing in English? So that I can understand it clearly. Yeah - Yeah? -You know what I'm saying, right? -Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Good! Yeah, please. So - guy - is walking - Walking on an empty road. [♪♪] [inaudible] ...opposite side of the camera, and that is how... ...guy and girl will meet in the end. -Yes, sir. -Good. Let me tell you one thing. I just don't find that vibe in your story, man! You know all these emotional things... It's all missing. I'm so sorry, Karthik. We just can't do this film. That's it. Bro, one tea. Bro, one tea. -Bro... -Huh? You are Karthik, right? I love your short films, bro. Thanks! I too love movies a lot, bro. Please tell me if you can get me a chance. Listen... The feeling you need to have towards movies is neither madness nor love. It's vengeance. Madness will get cured. Love will get shifted onto something else. But vengeance... It will be with you till the day you die. Try with vengeance. You'll get what you want. -All the best. -Thanks, bro. [phone rings] Karthik, where are you? Hi. I told you, right? Came out for story narration. Superb! Did he listen to your story? What did he say? He did, but... I doubt if he understood it. What? He doesn't know Telugu. So he asked me to narrate in English. I explained to him in the butler English I know. After the narration... He told me in English that the emotions are missing and sent me away. Your entire story runs on emotions, right? Our emotion will come out right only in our language. True. So what's Riya doing? She's bearing me. She trusts you more than you trust yourself. I fear the same. I fear if I might lose her trust. Chill! Why don't we got see a matinee movie? No, dude. I have a few more meetings today. Ok. Call me after you get free. Ok. Bye. We need a total of 15 episodes. A lead for season two would be even better. What episodes, sir? 'What episodes'? I'm talking about web-series. Web-series? It's a movie story, sir. Listen, every movie gets onto Amazon Prime after ten days of its release. Why would the public come to the halls after all? The future is Netflix and Amazon Prime. See, tell me if you have a story for a web-series. We can do it right away. I don't care about the story. My son has to be the hero. I can't spend more on publicity. So let's come up with a controversial title. Controversy gives us free publicity. Tell me how this title sounds - 'Lord Rama is not a nice man'. I need a song for every half hour. Where hero should squeeze the heroine like chapati dough. The theaters will be filled with youth. That's it! With one swing of a sword, the head should land in the laps of the audience. I want to make a movie like that. Even if it's not necessary, use Power Star's poster or a cut-out. His fans will get impressed and will make our movie a hit. Got it? -Sir, our story is-- -Just stop. This is a French movie. I just saw it yesterday. It's really nice. Let's remake it in Telugu. What do we need our own stories for? [indistinct chatter] Dude, did you see this? This is also a ripoff of some Korean movie. Of course, our directors will never be that self-sufficient. Correct! -Oh, my God! -What happened, dude? That fellow Venu Madhav (Telugu actor)... He died. Oh, about that? It was already shared on FB yesterday. Not yesterday... He just died in the hospital. -Is it? -Yeah. As if someone called, these films actors are dying one after the other, dude! Yeah. Dharmavarapu Subramanyam, Ahuti Prasad... That fellow M.S.Narayana, and now this Venu Madhav. Poor souls. Such nice actors! 'Poor souls'? Don't even say that. They died of too much drinking. It's common with these cinema people. They drink, they live high, and one day suddenly die. There are lot of actors next in the line. -[loud]: Hey! -[louder]: Hey! You have been listening to them talk nonsense... But... But none of you reacted. How old was Venu Madhav? 39-years-old man. Your uncle's age. Dharmavarapu Subramanyam sir... 53-years-old. Your father's age. M.S.Narayana sir is like your grandpa. And you talk so easy and respectless about them. At least you are not respecting the dead. How can you be so loose-tongued! What? How can you think so less of the film fraternity? A lot of people die every single day. Even actors are normal people like them. Even they fall sick... And even the die. If your friends or your family members pass away... Will you react the same way, huh? Cinema is with you in your happiness. Cinema is a comfort when you are in pain. Cinema is your friend in loneliness. No matter who stays or not, cinema will stay with you till your last breath. It's ok even if you don't support cinema. But never talk cheap about it. Please! [phone rings] -Hello!-Where are you? Please manage for half an hour. We'll be there. Hey, Karthik is here. We'll start. Get ready, quick. Where to? What! I told you about the party, right? Did you forget? As usual! Ok, go get ready, quick. Do you need me at the party, Riya? New clothes-- What's all this, Riya? Go, get ready. [phone beeps] Looks nice. Feel like kissing you. -I jinx it all the time. -Stop! Shall we? -Sir, order, sir. -Hmm! Being a waiter is not enough. You have to learn how to wait. -We are talking. Can't you see? -Sorry, sir. Hey, hello... Wait. How can you leave, while I'm still talking? Who hired you in the first place? There's no use blaming people like you. The one how hired illiterates like you... Your manager. -He is the one to be blamed. -Hey, why don't you take a break? God! She won't let me finish anything. What's the costliest item on your menu? This one, sir. Looks like some variety. Swi-ki... Get this one. That's a frog dish, sir. Such a loose tongue you are. Can't you stay normal without blaming someone? You have to. Or else, no one cares about you. -Tastes good? -Hmm. Eat. Now even she's making fun of me. Damn! Do I need the outfit and all this, Riya? If your colleagues-- -They'll think nothing bad. -Hey, the team lead is here. -Congrats! -Congrats, Riya. You can be late for the office. But you shouldn't be late for your own party. -Stop it! -Hey, your dress looks nice. Stop ragging me. Hey, bro... Why don't you join me for a drink? So, what else? -Your guy looks so smart! -Don't jinx it. -Hey, bro. Hi. -Hi. -Raghava. -Karthik. -Let me get you one. -No no. -Are you sure? -I'm good. That's ok... But when are you guys getting married? Did you come here directly from the office? What company are you working for? Company? I mean, you are in software industry, right? I'm asking what company you are working for. This November you'll complete three years! Did he even plan on marrying you? -How can you say that? -Why not? Tell me, what's stopping you guys? His settlement? When will he settle? Will he settle at all? What, boss? I just asked the company you are working for! I'm not in the software industry. What? How can that be? Riya told us you guys completed your engineering together. Yeah, but I'm not interested in the software field. Did he have any interest in marrying you? He loves me, Sushma. Love? You are in love with him since your engineering first year. After engineering, I have seen your love towards him many times. But I never saw his love towards you. When your parents didn't accept him... You came out, telling them that you'll marry Karthik once he gets settled. You rented a house here in Hyderabad. You are paying his expenses. And you are the one who's taking care of him. You are doing all this out of love. But what did he do? I'm trying my chance as a movie director, bro. Cinema field! Of course... ...will end up in the cinema field. I know a guy back home. Even he tried his chance in movies for a long time. Now he's shooting weddings. I mean, video. I gave him my wedding contract. He's coming to Hyderabab next week, bro. I'll introduce him to you. He might help you. Hmm? What do you say? He's always been talking about his cinema, ambition, and passion, but... ...he never even thought of what you wanted. Nor did he try to settle in life, at least for your happiness' sake. This is life. Not a two hours film. We can't just move on to our work after the show. Think wisely and make a decision. The time you spend on cinema is just a mere waste. Life means settlement. For example, look at me. I draw 80k per month. Next month I'm getting married too. Marriage at 26... Kids at 28... This is how perfect I have planned everything. Keeping trust in cinema industry won't promise you all these. Do this... Apply for a software job. I'll talk to the people at my office. Cinema is a waste, bro. Don't waste your time on it. [classic movie ringtone] The videographer I just told you about. Tell me, dude. One lakh for just the wedding photos! -[♪♪] -[indistinct dialogues] The food tasted great. Karthik, where's Riya? I think she's in the restroom. Restroom? Ok. Sir, bill. Sir. Pay it fast, Karthik. We can leave. We have credit card and Google Pay options too, sir. What happened, Karthik? Don't you have any money on you? Oh, you are jobless, right? How can you have any money? It's ok. Let's wait for Riya. Where did you go, Riya? See how helpless Karthik have been, unable to pay the bill. -Raghava. -Hmm? It's already late. If Sushmitha leaves, no one will even drop you home. You might even walk, being miserly to take a cab. Thanks for coming to the party. Will you please... -Thank you, madam. -Ok, let's go. Learnt your lesson? Your friend looks out for security in every aspect. But she's in love with someone who's not even fit to be a security guard. Hey, they might hear you. Move. Do you think she heard me? -Let's go. -Yeah, ok. I'm... sorry, Riya. You got into trouble with your colleagues because of me. Trouble? How can you say that? Nothing of that sort. I've been observing everything, Riya. You don't have an answer to any of their questions. In fact, I too don't have an answer. But... I don't want to see you being humiliated in front of them. -That's why I said-- -How many more years will you wait, Karthik? Huh? How can you stay this way, scared that someone might say something someday! Riya? I hated to see you stand in humiliation in front of them, Karthik. Not just them... My Karthik has to stand his ground in pride, in front of the whole world. And he needs to be happy. Enough of this, Karthik. You have been trying for three years for this movie. Stop now. I have been supporting you in front of my dad. I told him that you'll settle down in three years. And I challenged him that he will get us married after you did. I thought that three years is a lot of time. I supported you, so that you can achieve your dreams. Forget about three years. Now I understand that you can't settle even in the next ten years. I don't have that kind of patience, Karthik. I don't have the patience to keep seeing you in this position. [thunder claps] You feel bad because of me getting humiliated. But with you feeling bad... That's the most humiliated I can ever be, Riya. Riya. Tell me what to do. Leave cinema. Leave cinema, Karthik. I'll get you a decent job in our company. You have a very good percentage in engineering. And I'll get you an experience certificate for three years. Complete the mandatory course. I'll make sure you'll crack the job. Ok, Riya. I'll do as you say. Really? Tell me where the institute is. I'll go join tomorrow. [♪♪] Karthik? Come fast, or else I'll get late for office. Let's go? Yeah. [♪♪] What's today's special? Mutton biryani, ma'am. Nice! Get it. Wait... You don't like mutton biryani, right? How can you marry him? He can't even support the family! Then I'll support him. I'll be with Karthik until my last breath. [♪♪] You'll become a star director soon. And I doubt if you'll care about me then! Of course, I won't. You! [phone rings] -Hello!-Hello, bro. It's me, Suresh. -Do you remember me, bro? -Suresh? We met at the tea stall that day, remember? Suresh... Tell me. Brother, I tried hard just like you said. I got a cinema offer now. [♪♪] Hello, brother... Hello? Su-- Suresh, congrats! I'm at my native place now. I'll meet you once I come back to Hyderabad. -All this is just because of you, bro. -All the best! [♪♪] Hey, Karthik. I got a job. -Nice! -We have no problems now. I'll create an account for you and keep it full. Riya, you know I don't really like that. I do. Keep your entire focus on cinema. I'll take care of the rest. I just came to know that you didn't pay the college fees. If you don't have a problem with it, I'll pay. Hey, no need. The scholarship got delayed, that's it. Thanks! I'll manage. Won't your parents say no to this cinema passion? I-- I don't have anyone. I stay alone. Are you that crazy about cinema? I loved cinema way back from my 6th class. Karthik... Don't be tensed. Everything will be fine. -Ok? -Ok. Suprise! [celebrating] Congratulations, dude! Thank, God! You finally got settled. So... The next plan is to get married, right? What, boss? Even I took six attempts to crack this job. But you cleared it in a single attempt. Awesome, man! What's the number? 30k! You gave three years of your life to cinema. Did it pay you even a rupee? See? The starting package itself is four lakhs. It's ok. Even if you wasted time on cinema... Finally you got a perfect settlement. That's what life is all about, bro. Settlement. These passion and stuff... They are just trash. Only useless people talk about such stuff. So as you finally got settled... Next... get married. Our film maker is still free. I'll talk to him. He'll cover your wedding photography. He did my wedding too. -He did some nice work. -You'll arrange a photographer! He did my wedding, right? Even he'll have some work to do. Bro, you took six attempts to crack this interview, right? When you failed during the second or the fourth attempt... Why didn't you leave the software field once and for all? Because software job is your passion. [♪♪] You tried your best instead of failures and finally got what you wanted. Just like you attend interviews, I attend meetings with producers. You have a resume in your hand and I have a script. They'll interview you based on your resume, and me based on my script. If everything is ok, you'll get a job. Me... I'll get a movie. Software is your passion. Cinema is mine. Someone else has something else... When someone talks to you about his passion... Support him if you can. If you can't do that... -Shut up and mind your business. -What the fu-- Who the hell are you to decide if someone else's passion is right or not? What did you say that day? I chose cinema just because I couldn't bag a job, right? Look... Offer letter. I worked for just six months and cleared the job in a single attempt. I chose cinema not because I can't do anything else. I chose it because it's my passion. I'm planning to change it into my profession. You need cinema for your phone's ringtone. But not as a profession. You opt for cinema for weekend hangouts. But you consider film makers cheap. I... I don't understand why you don't consider cinema as a profession! Sushma, you keep saying that I need to settle down, right? What's settlement according to you? No one in this entire world can ever settle down. A man who draws 50k aims for 1lakh. 1 turns into 2 and he keeps chasing money until his last breath. Settlement doesn't mean earning a load of money and sleeping tight, Sushma. Those sleepless nights your excitement for the next day's work gives you... That's called settlement. No one can ever settle down, Sushma. One can only get satisfied. You'll be satisfied if you do what you love. It has nothing to do with your income. Tell me this... Are you satisfied with your life? Hey! He's earning just 30k and look at him talk like he owns the company. Is this why your friend called us for the party? Disgusting! What, Riya? Why are you silent? You can't keep quiet all the time, right? You are right, Sushma. She never talks. I was there, tensed about the win. Riya came to me... And told me not to get tensed. She said I'll definitely win. She said she trusts me. We won that match. During our third year... I said I wanted to direct a short film and my entire batch laughed on my face. But Riya took my hand into her hands... She said I can do it. She said she trusts me. And I did that too. I rejected the five lakhs a producer offered me for my story. And when I faced her that night... She said another producer will come along. She said, 'I trust you, Karthik. Just keep trying'. And I kept on trying. You know what's the strongest power in the world? When the entire world is killing the last bit of self-confidence remaining... A person stands right by you, and assures you that you can do it. Finding someone like that is really rare. Riya is that person in my life. She loves me unconditionally! The only person who believes in my future success. Riya. But-- But when she suddenly asked me to leave cinema behind... She never feared my failure. But how long can she take your hurting words and stay sane? Sorry, Riya. I would have told you all this, six months ago. But if I did, I feared that... You might look down on me and my passion... ...and take me to be a loser like they all did. I know, you can never think that way, but... There's-- There's a small fear somewhere in my heart. You have been thinking just about me all these days. I know how much you believe in me and how much you love me, Riya. The only thing I have achieved great in my life is... It's you. I have no idea when I'll reach my goal, Riya. But I'll never lose your trust. I feel like kissing you. [♪♪]
