- Now, this area is pretty much the same way it was when the Indians wandered around in it. That's because of this country's National Parks System Centers. It's into the National Park System to protect the wildlife, the forest from thousands of campers coming here every year. Now, I know that my opinion don't mean too much but, I think if we get any further encroachment on these park areas we're going to destroy the natural beauty of what you are looking at. If the government could somehow manage to protect these areas, we just might be able to keep this difficult, completely American landscape like this forever. Never thought you'd make it! - I wouldn't miss a Kelly briefing for the world! All right this is the largest post-season crowd we've ever had. There's just no way with this crummy crew that we're going to handle it. - What Kelly's concerned about is we got more backpackers pitching tents than raccoons in the woods. Okay, now everybody goes out on patrol. There's no way we can keep an eye on all those backpackers! - Well we're just gonna do the best we can. Okay, everyone knows where they're supposed to go. So, so let's get with it. Kelly... MY apologies. Accepted. ' Hey I'm going up to R4. You know, maybe the two of us should go! It's really loaded up there, Kell. Hey, come on I can use the help. Well now, see, Hayes called in sick. So I'm going to need Gail down here to kinda hold down the fort. Hmm-mm. We tried! Look, I'll talk to you later for dinner. . Okay- Okay girls, keep it moving. I know that the season's closed, but that's no reason to let up, huh? So if you get any complaints about cold food I wanna hear about them right away. - Dad! - What are those? Unpaid bills, I believe. - Aw, I must have put them in the wrong drawer, I'll take care of them right away. - And I've been looking over the wine list. You know, you haven't been charging nearly enough. Look what you've been paying! I know what I've been paying! ' And? - Well, good wine at reasonable prices brings the customers back and they've been coming back. - I know you've had a really good season, but- Allison. For the last two weeks you've been trying to help me run my business. That's not true. Dad, every man needs a helping hand - Yeah well you told me that you were coming up here to shoot pictures of the changing seasons! Well, I did. I am! That's what I've been doing. - Yeah, well keeping check on how your old man is doing is not going to help you meet your deadline. I only got maybe a third to go. I mean, maybe 30 or 40 more photographs. I got my publisher's note he'll wait. Allison? Why don't you write a how-to book? How to Avoid Responsibilities. Oh hell, I was supposed to meet you. Kelly, I'm sorry. Well, let's go. See you, Walt. - It was really sweet of you to come and get me. I really appreciate it. Thought I should be angry. I mean, I said I'd take you around but, you know I just might have been needed, I'm an important person around here! Guilty as charged! You know what the problem is? The problem is you're spoiled. And your father did it. How long have you known me? Oh, a few weeks. - Then, why don't you just reserve judgment. I mean, spoiled is a pretty heavy word. First of all, I don't feel spoiled. I feel needed. I mean, Dad's taking a lot more than he can handle so. I feel just a bit torn between career and father. - You know, I think your father can handle his end. It's yours you should be worried about. - Somehow I always manage to get it together. - At last, finally. - I believe we're here. We must have walked 10 miles today. We got to do something with this. - I want to sit down and get out of these boots. I feel a lot better. What's that? There's something out there. Hey. You scared us! Sorry, I didn't mean to. What can we do for you? Stay out of trouble. What kind of trouble? - Well, just don't take any unnecessary risks. This is a pretty tricky area. How long you girls going to be up here? - Oh we're leaving shortly, right after we eat Don't forget to check-in at the Ranger Station before you leave. - Don't worry, we'll be down before it gets dark. . Okay- Come on, boy. Well better get moving. It's gonna get dark pretty soon. You're right. - Why don't you start on the tent and I'll get the fire. Okay, but I have to go first. - Whenever it comes to cleaning up you always have to go. Ha, ha, I'll be right back. Hm-mm... June? June? Baby! Oh no... No! You never stop shooting, do you? Oh most of what I shoot I don't use. Wrong angle, wrong light. Wrong faces. No, the faces are never wrong. Remember, every face tells a story. Oh yeah? What story does this face tell you? You're a dissembler. You hide everything behind that tight jaw. One day it's gonna break. See, it's cracking already. How you doing, Tom? - Hey. - Where you going? Up to R4 got a couple of missing girls. On? Come on! They said they'd be down before dusk. They haven't made it yet Ah, they're not gonna make it. The sun will be down in a little bit. Hey, you want to go up with him? Uhuh! We'll follow you, go ahead! . Okay- They were back there, past the shack. Maybe 100, 150 yards. Let's walk on in. Hey, hold it Tom. I wanna out this shack. What the hell? Find anything? ' No. How about you? No, nothing. - Tom. - Yeah? How far down are you? - Ah, about quarter of a mile from the shack. There's just nothing here. I can't tell whether a bear came through or not. Well, keep looking. Roger, out. We better keep looking You all have done a hell of a job. You find anything? No sir, not a thing. All right. Keep at it. Remember, we're probably not looking for a full body. Kelly, what in the hell's going on? A bear, he attacked and killed a girl. - Jesus, that's all we need, a killer bear on the loose. Well, there were two of them. We haven't found the other one yet. Reckon she made it out? - No, too much blood around here for that. Well, what you want us to do? Look, I got a bunch of guys... Allison, where are you going? - Back here to get another angle on the cam. Okay, but don't go too far. Hey. Kell? Yeah? Parker and I came up empty-handed. Well, look. Get 'em back out there. Nobody sleeps until we get that son-of-a-bitch! Hey, come on Kelly, you can't- - Tom we got a killer on our hands, now no excuses, please. Dr. Newfell, Dr. Newfell. It was a big one all right. It seems to me, the girls came across the cub, got too close, and the mother attacked. They didn't find any sign of a cub. And we didn't find a sign of the bear anywhere. - Or she ate and buried the rest of her meal for later. Why would she come down? She came down for food. Oh shit. We holed them up to the high country last season. There is more than enough food and fish for them up there. Maybe she had enough fish. Hang on to your sick humor, Doc. - It's not sick, she was hungry enough to eat two women. Bears don't eat people. This one did. Hallitt, do me a favor. Just put it in writing for me. Who's ah, going to contact the family? Me, I guess. Why the hell wasn't I notified? Well, obviously you got the message. I had to hear it on the goddamn radio. - Hey, I'm glad to hear that uh, you turn it on these days Kittridge. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen. - Aw, that's okay, Hallitt, I was just leaving. I want to see that report now. Kelly! Okay, let's hear it. What the hell happened out there? One of our bears got lonesome. Came out for a little action. That's not funny. Not supposed to be. Well what are you doing about it? - Well, I've got men out on the field hunting him. And I've put R3 and R4 off-limits to campers now I think we can contain it in that area. _ okay This time, you keep me informed all the way. And when this thing is over with I want a full investigation. - Investigation? - Yeah. What kind of investigation? We have a responsibility to the public. I mean it's my head. Those bears are supposed to be in the high country. That's where we put 'em. Two possibilities. One of 'em came back, or you didn't do your job. No way. We tagged every one of those bears. Arthur Scott knows every bear that's in this forest. No way he could have missed one. - Okay, then Scott's the man I want to talk to. Now, you get him on the wire and get his ass out here. ' Kelly! I hope I'm not talking to myself. I read you, loud and clear. - We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin. Two young women were savagely killed last night by what the local authorities believe to be a large bear. Michael Kelly, ranger in charge of operations orders all backpackers in the high country to evacuate the area immediately. Campers in all other areas of the park should not venture in the upper regions until the rangers are certain the bear has been apprehended and the areas declared safe. If anyone should see this animal please contact your local authorities or the Park Ranger Service immediately. Stay tuned to 1060-NEWS for further up-to-the-minute news bulletins. - If Scottie is not in the office, where is he? All right if he's in the field, connect me. You mean you, won't connect me or you can't connect me? Well, you listen to me you little... I've got two girls, ages 19 to 20, both eaten to the bone. So don't give me any of your bullshit about regulations. Now, you get Scottie on that field phone or you're gonna be in the unemployment line tomorrow morning you get that? Yeah, I'm still here. Sit down. No, no... - What the hell's the matter with you down there. I gave strict orders. Who is this? It's Kelly, Scottie. Kelly! Kelly, do you know what you just did? I had a whole family of deer up here I've been following them, living with them and you scared them off. What happened? It's a bear, killed two girls, but, the funny thing happened is that he buried one of them. But bears do that anyway. They cover their kill with a shallow grave. Then they go away. They come back later and finish eating. - Look, Kittridge is holding you and me responsible, so, just pack it up and get your carcass here as fast as you can. All right. Who's Scott? - He's a naturalist attached to this department. You know, I think he knows every bear in this forest personally. - You guys really love what you're doing, don't you? Yeah. I really do. It sure has changed my values around. Changed your values? From what Kelly? Well, I... I had a perfect plan to fame and fortune. So what happened? I tried a shortcut. I married this beautiful lady. Who just by chance happened to be filthy rich. Trouble was, we were both mercenaries. And after a while, I just wanted out. I couldn't take it anymore. You left? - Well, it was a little more subtle than that. I made believe I was having an affair. That turned around. So I sold all my holdings, gave it to the Salvation Army, and became a Ranger. That turned her off! You're lying, aren't you? What do you think? I really don't care. Well, we're down in area three already. I don't think he's gonna come down this far. These woods are so damn thick you can't see anything anyway. Yeah, he could be hiding anywhere. - Well, one thing's for sure, he's not around here. - Look, why don't you go over and take a break, I'll go up to Powder Ridge and check it out and be back in about 15 minutes. - Good, I'm going to set my feet in the stream. . Okay- What the hell is going on? No! Have another drink? When will I stop remembering? It should take about 25 years. Jesus, poor Tom. He liked her, didn't he? Boy there's something I'm not doing! Sure, you're not killing the bear. I don't think I'm cut out for this. You know what I enjoy? Giving lectures around the campfire. Showing slides. Taking long rides in the woods and just, watching the animals. - For a man who thought of himself as a mercenary you're doing pretty fine. Oh yeah. There is a killer bear out there and I'm sitting right here crushing ice cubes in my mouth. Where the hell is that damn Scott? He'll be here. I mean there's nothing else you can do but wait. Oh yes there is. Except I'm too paralyzed to know what it is. You better have another drink. Nah. How about another ice cube? Yeah. You know Don, I wanna thank you for helping us out. Sure going to make finding that bear a lot easier. - Maybe's got some kind of favorite cave. - No, the reason we can't find him is, he's keeps moving. And he has a few million acres to cover his tracks. - Well if it goes near a clearing we mightjust pick him up. - Can you get this bird any closer? No, negative. Too much downdraft today. It might push it into the trees. - Feel like I've been, wearing these things permanently. - Have you locked into any of its patterns yet? You know, bears got patterns. Patterns, yeah patterns. He likes women, he keeps moving. - Sort of like me? - Always trawling. Yeah, yeah. What about that filly you been riding? Oh, I didn't know it was that way now. No offense, my man. - Hey, take her down, take her down I think I see something. Oh boy that might be our baby. Hold it, Kelly! Are you crazy? What the hell are doing up here? Trying to find your bear! - Well you're supposed to be down at camp. Kittridge is been all over me! - You better tell him that man that bear is not one of ours. - Are you sure? - Positive! - Well you, still should have come on down. Why? I can do better on my own. You almost got your tail shot off! Yeah, almost. Boy, if you ain't a big bag of grits. What the hell you'd done if you had caught that big brown? It isn't a big brown. It's a grizzly!. Grizzly? Hmm-mm. There ain't no grizzlies up here. I used to hunt these woods for years. It can't be a grizzly. - Come on Scottie, they were killed off years ago. Big bounty hunt, remember? This one survived. I'm telling you. It can't be! - I'm telling you we got a grizzly, and then some. Guys, I'm a little bushed can I hitch a ride back with you? Yeah, come on. You know that the average grizzly, he's about seven feet tall. - Some of 'em are shorter. - Hmm-mm. This one here is at least 15 feet. Oh no. Maybe in Alaska, just maybe, but not down here. Right here. I just checked the claw marks on the tree. - Now, that means he's established his territory. The whole damn forest? What you talking about is unreal. Wait, I got a little more. According to the depth of his paw prints he weighs over 2,000 pounds. You boys want a bite? Look Scottie. You may be some kind of authority on all this but what you talking about is science fiction, a fairy tale! Science? Yeah. Fiction? No. See the only known grizzlies that large were called Arctodus Ursus Horribilis. On? And they were the mightiest carnivores in the Pleistocene era. Yeah well, when was that? About a million years ago. Ah, he's a mere baby then! Well, he was a hardy ancestor that managed to hang in there. - What the hell is a million year old grizzly doing here? He's looking for food. They were, strictly carnivore, those things. They sure do love meat. - Well, in that case let's get the hell out of here. Sure enough. # I've been working on the railroad # # All the live long day # # I've been working on the railroad # # Just to pass my time away # # Can't you hear the whistle blowing J" # Rise up so early in the morn # # Can't you hear the whistle blowing J" # Dinah, blow your horn # ' No! No, no! - Don't come near her! - Do something! Somebody do something! - All right you people, move on back a step. Let's go now, go on back to your campsites. We got it here. Go on back. Come on now get those kids out of here. It's over, come on, clear on out. Everybody back to your campsites let's go. Keep it moving. That's it. Mr. Walker? You can uh, well you can ride in the ambulance. Sally loved me, mister. Is he really dead?. Come on. What the hell happened? I thought you said he as in the high country. Did I say that? Well, I guess he came down. - Kelly, this is your baby, your responsibility. I'll wash my hands in it. You'll wash your hands huh, well it's your park, Mr. Park Supervisor! - And this is your district, nobody else's, and that bear is yours. Correction on that. You didn't do the job Scott. Hey you got your head in the sand, we got a killer grizzly on our hands. Scott you're a maniac, always we're running around in costumes. There are no grizzlies! - Oh you donkey. - Come on let's go Scott. Kelly, I want that damn bear! Then give me some men from Washington. - Yeah and blow this thing out of proportion? Listen, campers come in here, they leave food around, the bears get the smell of it and that's it! Well this is different! This bum is eating his victims! - I have to agree four people have been killed. So let's quit arguing responsibility. You've got enough men at your disposal. Now either you do the job or I will. Yeah sure you will. If there's a bear out there I'm going to get him. Not if I get him first. You be careful,. - You got the ammo, Charlie? - Yep, I got plenty. We'll flush that old-boy out. - Easy fella, easy, don't get rambunctious! Damn dogs. Hunters. What the hell are they doing out here? They're probably looking for your bear. - Who opened up this forest for the hunters, huh? You know that those clowns they're going to shoot everything in sight. - Well, let them. They might get that old bear for us. - Yeah, including some of my Rangers. I'm gonna head back. Jesus! God! Oh jeez! Oh God, oh God! Ah. Oh God! Ah Jesus! There are seats in this room. - I don't wanna sit I wanna know what those hunters are doing out there. I didn't have a choice. - You, you made it open season for every animal in those woods. - My instructions were clear, they're hunting for bear. - It's not bear, it's grizzly, it's a difference. A bear is a bear. A bear is not a bear, believe it or not. Besides you've got a bunch of drunken bums out there, not professional hunters! I can't help that. You always get a few crazies. I want them out of my forest. It's not your forest, Kelly. - Do you know those woods are full of campers? Not in R3 and R4. Do you think they're walking around with a map or something? They are no danger! Bull! I'm through. No. I'd like to ask you something. Why are you on my ass? I'm glad you asked that. Kelly, you're a maverick. We don't have room for mavericks. - Well let me tell you something Kittridge... While you've been sitting around here on your fat ass I made this forest part of me. - You listen here you- - No, you listen! Those hunters are in my jurisdiction, and I'm gonna deal with them the way I see fit. Now you just try and stop me! Scottie, wake up. Tom? - Yeah. - You okay? - Fine. Bastard got a hold of a hunter. He managed to get away. Where is he? Over at the clinic. He's really beat up. He was also one lucky hunter. Yeah. Okay, let's go. Hey Scottie will you take Don over to pick up his stuff? Hey load in some extra rifles. We'll need em'. I was feeling unloved. Well, so was I. But I'm glad you stopped by. We're just getting ready to take off. I'm coming with you. Look, it's a butcher's shop out there and you just couldn't handle it. I couldn't? - All right, maybe I couldn't handle it then. Look, I'll stay out of your way. Honey, it's not safe out there, now I don't want to see you get hurt I mean, for both our sakes. - Is that a line that's supposed to make me feel grateful? - And I don't feel like playing little boy-girl games. You just said the wrong thing! Now you just pack it up. You're not going with me. Damn it, Kelly! I'm glad you see it my way. Really! I just lost 2O years. This just might be that old grizzly's cub. No way. It's possible. Hey. Hey listen! That thing might come in here after that cub. Let's get him outta here. He's right put it back in the woods. Hey, I got an idea. We'll use this cub as bait. We'll take it back in there find us a clearing. We'll go in the blinds. When Mama comes by... POW! It's a lot different from deer hunting. Yeah, that damn thing fights back. - Hey, we gonna have to hold the noise down. The damn thing might not even come around. - Whose stupid idea was it to use that cub as live bait? It was mine. - Now, that's the kind of bait we need to use, Kelly. - It really doesn't make any difference anymore, does it? Anybody see it happen? - Nah she just grabbed up the cub and that was it. We know one thing for sure. What's that? Our grizzly is a he instead of she. Now, how the hell you know that? You been peeking? - Don't have to, only the males are cannibalistic. They'll eat a cub if they are hungry. Yeah but, does that help us, Danny? - Sure does, he's going to retrace his route. I mean he's going to come back the scene of his crime. - So then, he ah, could still be around here? He could be listening to us right now. - Well, if that's the case maybe we can flush him out. Can we help? Yeah, but we go by the book. Everyone follows orders. You call the shots, mister. - What's your name? - Pat. Okay Pat you and the rest of the guys go up the north ridge. That's ah, Pinto Pass. I know where it is. All right. We're going to spread and hold the line at Culvert Basin. Now, if he comes down, that's were he's coming down. - Hey listen, you ole boys come down that ridge and make like a war party, make a lot of noise, will you? Maybe that crazy will head towards us? All right. We'll expect you to be in place and ready to go at, ah? Daybreak. Well, let's get with it. . Okay- - Tom, you're not going to be coming with us. What? - You're not leaving me out of this, man, no way! I'm not leaving you out of anything. I'm assigning you to Arrow Tower. Don't do me any favors. Look, I can handle myself down here. Now you cool off and listen. Now, you know how thick it is down her. Now, from up there you might be able to spot him. And you might get a crack at him. - Yeah and I might just get left out of all this damn thing. Tom! You're not going to be left out of anything. Okay? - Wish to hell it would hurry up and get daylight. - It won't be much longer. - Not? - It's still a little bit chilly this morning, though. Ain't it? - Yes sort of cool for this time of year, anyway. - You come on. - All right. Let's go. Let's keep it quiet, okay? Kelly, I'd like to have the first shot. Well, I can't promise you that. See, we got a grizzly out there that's at least 15 feet tall. Weighs maybe two, 3,000 pounds, right? I want to capture it. You what? You want to capture it? - That's right. He's not kidding. I've been developing these brand new tranquilizing shells and... Oh Christ! That shell won't penetrate a hair of its chinny-chin-chin. Not trying to kill him with it, mister. Just want to put him to sleep. Oh yeah well, that's fine. But first you got to knock him down. That baby won't do it. We'll see about that. - Well, I sure hope you ain't out there alone. You're liable to become its breakfast. I figure, that old grizzly's hungry by now. Not for a while. I told you he just ate the cub. I doubt if he's hungry now. Oh yeah? Well, that was merely an appetizer, my man. I figure that old grizzly has had himself some human flesh and he's ain't gonna settle for nothing else. That's pretty ridiculous. It is, huh? Well, let me tell you a little story, boy. A long time ago there was a tribe of Indians up here in these woods. They's was all laid down with the pox, uh, something I can't remember... Anyway, this herd of grizzlies smelled them out. They come in, and they ate 'em. They tore them all up. Little children, the sick ones, everybody. There's a few braves just healthy enough to go out on the hunt. They came back, and the grizzlies turned on them! So, there you had a little situation. A whole herd of man-eating grizzlies. Was just parading around tearing up the Indians. That's pretty hard to believe. - Unless you happened to be one of them Indians. Yeah... Kelly! I can still root him out my own way. Hell, I can look like him. I can smell like him. Now, give me a chance. Let me go in! You got a dime? I'm going to call his mama! I mean, does your mama know that you're running around out here in the woods trying to act like a bear? You smelling like one. You scratching around on the ground like one? I mean, does she know that you're making a damn fool of yourself, you're chasing something about the size of a D8 Cat with teeth? You know, I think your mama would be a little disappointed in you. Maybe... But not nearly as disappointed as she would be if she had you for a son. Sonny! Scottie! Scottie! You spotted him first. You get a crack at him. But I don't want you going out in those woods alone. Post, here. - Do you see anything moving out there at all? Only your hunters tearing up the forest. - Well, keep looking, he has to be out there someplace. Jesus. It's the grizzly! Hold on Tom, just hold on. We're on our way! Come on Don, come on! Come on he's right there, we're almost there! - How do you think this bear thing is being handled? - Okay, I guess, I mean, they kept the bear away from here. And that's what counts! I surely feel sorry for that poor Forest Ranger, though. Yeah, I think we all feel the same way. - I'm sorry. - So am I. Is there anything I can do? No, he had a family. Send some flowers. I've got a plan. But I need time and men. - Kelly, I'm not- - Listen! Just listen. He got Tom here. Now, his first, his first killing took place up here. He circled and killed, circled and killed. He circled and found and killed Gail here. Then he circled again, got behind us, and killed Tom. Now, I think he's gonna continue heading down looking for human food. That thing seems to know what we're thinking. And I'd like to get the jump on him this time! A grizzly is an animal, Kelly. Don't give him human qualities. He's not even listening to you, Kelly. See, he doesn't understand that we're dealing with a, highly intelligent beast. Scottie... Scottie! Will you take that sandwich outside and eat it? Please? Charley! Close the park and give me another crack at it. There is no need, to close the park. Do you know that there are more, more reporters out there and TV cameramen than there are animals at the goddamn circus? I invited them. You invited them? I want them to see the kind of clean, thorough job that we are capable of doing. You're kidding! We have five dead people, one raving, almost dead man! And you call that, clean? We are doing everything I- Bullshit! ' Kelly! You know, I just figured you out! You don't give a good goddamn if we get that grizzly or not! As long as you get your press. So you can go to Washington and get one of those nice dark brown plastic offices! Get out! Well, you just lost your office! Because when I'm finished with you. There's not gonna be anybody there waiting to shake your greasy, bloody hand! You are finished, dismissed, removed! Up. Yours. Oh whatever his words, don't take it all on your shoulders. They're not broad enough! Yeah, I mean uh... What the hell do hunters know about... Rangers know hunting. You know something, Scottie? Do you know the kind of real estate deal I could make on this property. I mean if it was a private property of course. First I'd parcel off the lots, then- Do whatever you like. Well if you wanna hang up yourjack, that's your business. Scottie, do me a favor. Go home! Nah-ah. L'ma get that grizzly. - What? - You heard me. Stay out of the forest. Why? It's not just a job to me. I'm in the forest anyway! It's like home to me, I like it there and I can find him! - You're crazy, you know that, you're crazy! Could be. But meanwhile, you could just sit here and nurse your battered pride, and your Scotch. And I'll get us our Ursus Horribilis. Robert, you stay close now, you hear? Do you hear me? Yes, Ma'am. Help! ' No! Mommy! ' No! Carnival over? Yes. Everybody goes? Yes. That includes the press, mister. The park's closed. The people have a right to know. Oh, you got your story. The story is about greed. I don't want him to go to Washington. I'm feeling sorry for myself. - Hey, that's a good lead line for the story. - Well, your hands aren't clean either, pal. You and your cameras, you've made it so exciting. So attractive. We told it like it was. - There's only one person who can tell it how it was. And that's little Bobby. He's alive? Part of him is. If we can get him to the city hospital in time. We will... This feels like 'Nam all over again That special excitement. Ah, we'll get him this time. You think so, huh? Well, I don't got a choice. Hey listen, I wanted to thank you, ah, I'd be in over my head without your help. You're getting it. All right. If this ain't all ironic! Now, in 'Nam I was after about 100, maybe 200 gooks. People. We called them gooks so it wouldn't get personal. But it did get personal, anyway. So I stopped counting and tried to stop caring. You know, now I don't kill nothing no more. Not even flies. Made myself that promise. _ rm sorry. No, sorry ain't necessary. This is my choice. I could've said no. Where's Scott? Ah, he went out there on his own. He's crazy. You know, that boy is weird. What makes you think this old bear really booted back up country? Well, what we know about grizzlies. They don't like to stray. This one made it into town. I call that straying. No, I think he is just lost. He wants to go home where it's safe. We gonna help him go home? Here! - I got one. - No, that army rifle you got ain't gonna get what we need. This here is 30.06 with a K4 scope on it for fast shooting. You gonna need it. Hold this, will you. Oh Mommy, I wish my mom had taught me how to tie a knot. Just take it over there somewhere. Right. If we get kinda downwind that old bear might smell us now and won't come on after it. You could help. Ah, that mother's heavy. Okay. Hold it right there. I am holding it right there. Don, would you lift? What do you think I'm doing? Come here, sweetheart, get up! Okay. Here. L'ma go on back and get the rest of the gear. All right. I'll start on the blind. Don! Right here, he's on the run! We lost him! We were right behind him! I don't know about that. He's gone. Christ! We must have run a mile! - Only thing to do is to go back to, the copter. Aw, son of a bitch. He figured us out. He took us out and then circled back. That's what he did. - We're just like, ah, a couple of his toys. We are. You know, he could circle back 'round here again. Well, don't even say that. Because we gotta try and get some sleep. It's too late for tracking now. Let's go on back to the chopper. All right. ' Ho! - Are you sure you wanna take the first watch? Oh, ah, by the way, just in case you should fall asleep, and feel a wet snout on the face, whatever you do don't move and don't kiss it back because it ain't me. Hah, that ain't funny. You know, you're right! Kelly, come in. This is Kelly, Scottie. Where the hell are you! Never mind that. Just listen to me. I found a partially eaten buck. That must be one that we gutted. - What are you talking about? - Never mind. Where are you? I think it was our that was our grizzly that was doing the eating. Where the hell are you, Scottie! What do you want, compass coordinates? No, a street and zip will do. All right. I'm above R4 in Zone 821. Okay. Stay there. No listen, on second thought get the hell out of there. He might be coming back for the rest of his meal. That's just what I'm hoping for. Look. I got a rope. I'm gonna put it around his neck and haul him through the woods to where you fellas are with any luck our friend is gonna follow. Negative. - I'm leaving right now, I'll meet you halfway. Scottie. Scottie! Come on! How are we gonna get him back? I will bury him here. We'll radio in the coordinates and someone can come and get him. It's funny how that fella kinda goes up and down like some kind of yo-yo. I'm getting ready to kill again and can't hardly wait. I kinda liked that old boy. You know, when I was kidding around with him I never meant him no insult. I know. You know, Don, you two were a lot alike. - Let's have another look at that grid map. There. Right there, that's were he's going. Back to his first kill. I mean it's incredible! He's programmed. Like some kind of damned computer. How? Why man? Hell, I don't know. Why do salmon swim back upstream where it all began? Hey you're getting kind of close. Have faith, brother! Oh wait man, he's really moving. - Let's give the son-of-a-bitch a run for his money. I think we lost him. I see him. I see him! He's a mother-lovin' runner! Just takes one rocket. We'll get that damn launcher and blast it! Set her down. You sure? Yeah, let's go in after him. He's tired, he's scared, he needs to come back out. All right. Oh shit... Ah Kelly!
