Don't make them like they used to. No. Well, they make them better. I just can't afford one. Do you want a lift? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Come on. Are you sure this is what you want? No, miss. I'm just wasting your time. An abortion isn't something that you rush into, you know. Can't come soon enough for me. What about Robin? Have you told him yet? What's the point? He doesn't love me anymore, does he? No, but it's still his child... and I know that you've still got feelings for him. I hate his sodding guts, if that's what you mean. You're not doing this to spite him, are you? Look, I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying, have you thought it through? I've thought about nothing else, have I? Last thing I need round my neck right now is a kid- bringing it up on my own, no money, no father. Anyway, you get a better deal in here, don't you? Reeva Dobson got made into a red band when she got rid of hers. That is no reason for having an abortion. Anyway, it doesn't work like that anymore. I run a different regime now. It's not different inside the screws' heads. You can't change that so easy. Sorry, miss. I just don't see why you're trying to change my mind. It's all booked, isn't it? I just want to make sure you're doing the right thing. I think you probably are. Then what are we hanging around for? Can't we just get on with it? Oh, I hope I'm not starting with a stoop. - You what? - It's these keys if I am. Over the years, they pull you down. I don't know why we can't have key cards like they do in hotels. Oh, and they ruin your nails. - Haven't you finished yet? - What? I told you to mop that floor, not wear it down to the joists. Don't mind Mrs. Hollamby, Rachel. She's just in one of her moods. Whose side are you on? Where's she skiving off to? Day by the seaside, miss. I'd believe it and all. It's like Butlins in here. They'll have us wearing red coats and doing party turns next. We're on our way to the clinic. There's always something wrong with them, isn't there? Have you noticed? She's having her termination, remember? Oh, right. Well, why didn't you say? I find it hard to talk about my real feelings, miss. - All set? - Yeah. Take care, Zandra. It's precautions she wants to take in future. - What? - Well, look at her. Wondering how I did it inside? Why do you think they call 'em "screws"? - Zandra. - And if you're into bondage... Zandra, do yourself a favor, yeah? If you'd like to come with me. Hi, Rach. You seemed a bit down this morning. What's wrong? You've been ignoring me. Listen, love, I've got a very important job to do in here. Oh, like shagging Dockley, you mean? All I've been doing with her is patching up the mess that you started. That I started? Well, who else told her we were having an affair? - Well, it wasn't me. - Well, no one else knows. Look, I'm sorry if you think I'm ignoring you... but I'm risking my job by being with you. Now she suspects. I have to keep her sweet. Otherwise, she could grass me up. Sweet? OK, she has got a soft spot for me... so I have to keep her from being jealous. But Shell Dockley-please. Get undressed, then put this on, please. Sir, can you help me get my knickers off? I've only got one hand. It's gonna be cozy, this, isn't it, miss? You and me lying on the bed together while I have my operation. Is there just the one door? There's a fire exit, but it's alarmed. - What happens next? - We run a few tests- blood pressure, things like that. She does need to get undressed. One false move. Yeah, I'm really gonna shin down the fire escape... with this bleeding Kleenex. Lorna, I'm gonna wait in the corridor. Maybe I'll get her transferred to another wing. Well, that'd be brilliant. Take time, though. 'Cause she's been getting worse. She's going to do something to me. I know it. - Well, I won't let her. - You're not always around. I'm never very far away. Am I really the only one? Of course you are, love. I'd never let any harm come to you. - It won't hurt, will it, miss? - No, you won't feel a thing, my love. What will they do with the baby when it's, like, gone? Well, it's not a proper baby yet, Zandra. Well, it's alive. Well, yeah, but it's not- You've nothing to worry about. Robin should be here with me. He said he loves me, then he goes off with somebody else. They promise you the world, then they dump on you. I want to know what they do with the dead babies, miss. Will I see it before they throw it away? I want to see it. I'll go get the sister. She'll put your mind at rest. No, don't leave me! I'll just be a minute! Just lie yourself down. - I'll be right back. - No. Just have to get the sister. She's cutting up rough in there. It's gonna be fun hanging round here all day, isn't it? Should have brought your Stephen King, shouldn't you? I haven't got nothing, Shell. Have I spoken? You're gonna do something for me. - Or your mother is. - What? She's gonna collect some sweeties for me this lunchtime. My mother? That's the address. She's coming from Stockport. Steve Kennedy is the guy's name. He's expecting her at 1:00. It's in Clapham- ten minutes from here. Take her no time at all. But she's bringing Maddy in today. - Who? - My little girl. She's only ten months old. Brilliant. She can stick 'em in her nappy. I can't ask my mother, Shell. Anything but that. Stop whining, will you? Look, you can't do this to me. I'll tell somebody what you're doing. You'll get into trouble. - Is that your little girl? - Yeah. Sweet, isn't she? Shame if anything happened to her. Do as what I say... and I might just be all right with you. Disobey... and I'll cut your tits off. 00, OK? Mum? - Rachel? Is something wrong? - No. Why? Well, I'm seeing you this afternoon. Why are you wasting your phone card? I want you to do me a favor. I need you to go somewhere for me before you come and visit. - It's not far. Clapham. - Clapham? Yeah. Bourne Grove, number 2. There's this guy, Steve Kennedy- He's got something for me. - I said you'd pick it up at 1:00. - Got what for you? It's just a package. Well, it's not for me. It's for another girl-Michelle. Well, why can't she get one of her friends to bring it in? It's just some jewelry- a brooch and that. Rachel, I'm not stupid. This is why you're in there in the first place. - What? - Well, drugs, of course. Do you think I was born yesterday? I'm not allowed to bring things in for you. - Never mind anybody else. - Mum, please. Oh, shit, my card's running out. We've got enough to worry about this afternoon without that. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you when I see you. Mum, listen. You've got to get this package for me. Mum? Mum! Shit, shit, shit. It's quite common. They don't think it through... then when they get here and it hits them, they lose it. Where's Zandra? Isn't she in there? What's happened? She's done a legger, Dominic, right under your nose! I've been here all the time. She didn't go out the fire escape. She's not in the toilets. - Did anyone see her? - No. - Get your security onto it, will you? - Yes, of course. We better call the prison. No, Dominic. We find her. 'Cause if we don't, you and me start looking for another job. - She's been threatening me again. - Not now, Rachel. She wants my mum to bring some stuff in for her. - Tell her she's out of order. - Oh, yeah? Just like that? She says she'll cut my baby if I don't do what she wants. Look, she's just mouthing off, OK? - You said you'd protect me. - I am. You've got to get her transferred. She's gonna kill me. I know it. Rachel, will you shut it? What did I tell you earlier about being careful? Now, just go and pull yourself together... and leave this to me, OK? - I need to see him. - Get out. - Robin! - What are you doing here, anyway? Robin! It's me-Zandra! Get out, or I'm calling the police. No, mother, don't. Rob! God, why didn't you answer any of my letters? I've missed you. We're gonna be all right, aren't we? But what about our baby? What's up with you? Had it already this morning, have you? Oh, don't start that crap again. I'm getting her moved, you'll be glad to hear. What, to another wing, so you can shag her where I can't see? To another prison. You haven't got the clout. I'm in with those that have. What are you doing that for? I want a quiet life. I'm sick and tired of you two at each others' throats. She's been bleating to you, hasn't she? Well, just thank your lucky stars I'm the only one. If she talks to anyone else, we're in deep shit. - So just lay off her, OK? - Yeah, OK. I mean it, Shell. She could grass us up if you push her too far. Yeah, I get the picture. Anyway, we wouldn't want this to come to an end, would we? Only thing that keeps me going. Listen, I'd better be off. How about a good-bye kiss, eh? I told you in my letters, if you'd bothered to read them. Why are you dressed like that? 'Cause I've just legged it from the hospital, didn't I? Mental hospital, I don't doubt. I was going to have an abortion, and I ran away before they could do it. Then I suggest you go back and pick up where you left off. You don't tell me what to do. It's our baby-mine and Robin's. - How do we know that? - Cause I never slept with no one else. Tell her, Robin. Why don't you speak to me? We can still get married. We can have a family like you wanted. I could be out in ten months with good behavior. I'm calling the police. That wouldn't be very smart, Mother, would it? Just leave us alone, will you? I'll sort this out. Listen, Zan, I'm not sure it would work anymore. We're too different. You said we were meant for each other. Yeah, but things have- I don't know. They've shifted. I'm in that doll's house, while you're in here living it up... and you don't even care about our baby. Yes, I do. But I didn't know there was one till five minutes ago, did I? So what are you gonna do about it? You can't ignore it. I've got rights. Fathers have to pay. Is that what you want? Is that what you want?! Hello. What can I get you? Just vegetables. Got some nice veggie flan, if you don't want the mince. Try a bit. Spare place in the mailroom and all, if you're interested. Twelve quid a week, you get. Mince or flan, Denny? Oh, dear. One of those days? They've just told me Spencer can't come today. Oh, that's a pisser. - He's got a chest infection. - Nothing serious, I hope. Oh, it's just- it's the first time he's been ill without me to look after him. I mean, he's bewildered enough there when he's well. What he'll be like when he's poorly... I'm sure he'll be fine, Monica. You watch. Yeah. What about you? Is Trish coming today? - All being well. - You don't sound so sure. Just a bit nervous. I'll be OK. - You all right, Rachel? - Yes, miss. Nothing wrong, is there? No, miss. You know, you'd settle in a lot quicker... if you let people help you. What? Well, just now at the servery. You should make more of an effort. Stop being so standoffish. People mean well. Give them a chance, eh? - Look, we've searched everywhere. - Yeah, I know. The longer we don't let them know... All right. All right? - Did you get it? - What? The package. Oh, Rachel, I told you this morning. Oh, Mum! There is no way that I am bringing that kind of thing in here. Do you want me locked up as well? - It's not what you think. - Then why are you so upset? Because some girl's not getting a brooch, or whatever you said it was? It's what else I haven't brought that you should be worrying about. You've not even noticed. Maddy. Where is she? Where's Maddy? That's what we need to talk about. Miss Stewart's going to love you when she hears about this. What's she gonna do, send me to prison? You get two months off your remission at least. - Two months?! - You absconded, Zandra. What do you think is gonna happen-a royal pardon? Unless we don't say anything. You what? Well, she's been through enough trouble for one day, hasn't she... to put her through any more aggro? It's not going by the book, but I think we should keep shtum. - I don't believe this. - Think about it, sir. You ain't gonna come up smelling of roses, either, are you? Letting a con slip the reins like that- - Ow! - Don't push it, sweetheart! - That hurt! - Good. 'Cause from now on, every time a con asks me... to take the cuffs off while she has a baby or whatever... I'm going to think, "Why the hell should I trust her?" And I'm going to put a lot of women through a lot of pain- not because I want to, but because of what you just did. So think about that next time you piss one of us about Zandra, yeah? You just put her into care without telling me? I tried to talk to you last time. - You never said you'd do it. - We couldn't cope with her. You mean your bloody boyfriend couldn't. Oh, that's not fair. David's never had any children. Some guy you've known for half an hour says, "Get rid," so you do. I have to have a life, you know. It's been very difficult for me... and I'm not getting any younger. If I'm going to find someone- You don't want to be saddled with Maddy? Think about it. What kind of life was she getting? I haven't the energy or the time. I have to work. Then there's the expense. She's my daughter- your granddaughter! Yes, I know. And if you'd have been coming out sooner... maybe I could have hung on. But it's gonna be a year, at least. That's a year out me life. Oh, we couldn't have that, could we? It's only temporary. You should be able to get her back once you get out. You never wanted me to have her in the first place, did you? Rachel, don't start. Well, you've got what you want now, then, haven't you? Well, he put the power shower in. Does it work? Yeah, except he put it on the side instead of over the taps... so every time you stand up, you crack your ribs on it. Oh, no. He's gonna have to pull a load of tiles off just to move it. You should've got a woman to do it. Tell me about it. You didn't want to make me jealous, did you? I know. I decided after your last visit... I'm going to keep my nose clean from now on, whatever it takes. I could be out in ten years if I play it right. If you can wait that long. Drives me crazy when I ring and you're not there. Still, I expect you're busy with the bathroom and that. I know you still love me. It's all that keeps me going. You do still love me, don't you? Trish? I'll always love you, Nik. You know I will. That's all right, then. What's her name? Please don't be angry with me, Nik. I knew it. It's been two years, Nikki. - It's been the same for me. - I know. I know, but I can't handle it. And I can? It's a million times worse in here. Look, we always said if we found it too hard- But you're all I've got! I know. But what's the point if we can't be together? Do we just stop living for ten years? I stop living either way if you do this. Is it anyone I know? So that's it? Just like that? I'm sorry, Nik. She'll be better looked after where she is. Why? 'Cause I'm a lousy mother? Well, thanks for coming, Mum. You've really made my day. - Rachel. - Piss off! Hey, sit down there. Frees us both up, I suppose. That's one way of looking at it. Why? Have you met someone? There's a few nice girls in here. You never said. No. Well, as long as we were an item... I hadn't done much about it. I said you'd meet someone. You were right. We're still friends? Of course we are. Hicksy's mother bring that stash? No, she didn't. So, what are you gonna do? Nikki? Good news. I've just spoken to my solicitor. We've got a date for the appeal. Are you OK? No. What is it? Trisha's got someone else. - Oh, no. - Yeah. Oh, Nikki, I am so sorry. Yeah, well... there's my vegetable patch out the back... and books to read. I'll be fine. Well, anyway, I said to my Bobby... that there was no way that we could afford- Oh, give it a rest for a minute, can't you?! We've had nothing but "Kum flamin' Ba Yah"... for the last half-hour. So? This is my hobby. I'm entitled to sing. Please. I can hardly hear myself think. You shouldn't be gossiping, anyway. You're at work. You'll be on a report before you know it. I'm warning you. Answering me back! You're getting too cheeky for your own good. Denny, you stupid cow! Look what you made me do! - What's going on? - Are you all right, Hicks? - Denny bumped into me, miss. - I'm sorry, miss. I didn't see her. Brainless twat! All right, Dockley, that's enough! Are you all right? - Here, let me dry you off. - Get off me! She's only trying to help you. Come on, let's go find the nurse. Spot of Germolene- be as good as new. - Sorry, Rach. - Especially if it singed your minge. And Jim can't get his sausage in. How was she? Nervous as hell. I even told her I'd met someone else, make it easier for her. Crazy, isn't it? They kick you in the face and- It's called love, I believe. The reason I'm in here-love. I took out the copper who tried to rape her. What happened? I turned up at the club one night to take her home. There was just her and this shit who used to come in- D.S. Gossard. You had to butter up the local filth to keep 'em off your backs. Most of them were OK, but... Gossard. He had her pressed against the bar... and he was saying... "Come on, rug-muncher... "have some of the real thing for a change." I just saw red. I picked up a bottle and I smashed it over his head. He just laughed. So I stuck what was left of it in his neck. Soon took the smirk off his face. I could be out of here in ten years. I'll be 44. - While she moves on and- - You can move on, too, Nikki. In here? Don't make me laugh. Look, you're feeling low. Why not talk it over with your personal officer? Give it a rest, Monica. Look, I know you mean well and all that, but... Lorna Rose? How could anyone thick enough to work here help me? You've had an upsetting experience. Yes. And I'll deal with it like I have to deal with everything from now on- on my own. I hear you had an accident. What happened? That head case you were going to have a word with... chucked red hot tea all over me. Well, Mrs. Hollamby said it was an accident. She saw it. Look, I did have a word with her. She was all right at lunchtime, wasn't she? Yeah, like she was all right in front of Hollamby when she burnt me. All saying sorry and dabbing it off. Are you all stupid? There's a woman trying to kill me and you don't even care! She's not trying to kill you. Have you forgotten what she's in for? Torturing the woman that took her boyfriend, setting light to her. She didn't set light to her. You don't believe that bollocks, do you? She'd lie her way out of anything. Rachel, you're getting hysterical. This is what I warned you about. It's going to go on forever, I just know. - And my mum came in today. - Yeah? She's put Maddy into care. She said I'll get her back, but I won't. Well, that's why you're upset. It's not just that- it's everything. You said you'd deal with Shell, but you're shagging her... like you'd shag anything in a skirt. You're just using me. I'm getting a bit tired of this. Oh, and I'm enjoying it? Well, I'll tell you something- she lays one more finger on me... and I'm going to Stewart and I'm telling her everything. About you and her, and about you and me. That wouldn't be very clever. - It'd get you into trouble. - It would if they believed you. Cons say things like that all the time. Nobody listens. All that happens is... they lose their friends in high places. Do that and you're on your own. I'm on my own anyway, by the looks of things. Well, that's up to you. Rock-a-bye, baby On the tree top When the wind blows The cradle will rock When the bough breaks The cradle will fall And down will come Rachel Baby and all Jesus! Just in time for my tea break. Yes, all right! You silly, stupid girl. - Still tongue, wise head, OK? - I wish I was as deep as you, miss. - OK? - Yeah, OK. And what if she blows it? She won't. One night when she's smacked up off her head... you don't know what she'll do. And what's the alternative, eh? Telling Stewart she legged it from under your nose? That'll look good on your file, won't it? You're showing a lot of concern for others. You know, first Zandra, now me. So? I'm looking after number one as well, Dominic. So should you be. Get real. I can't believe this. I put you in an enhanced cell. That's a privilege, Rachel. You know that. Mr. Fenner and Mr. McAllister have given you good reports. Everything's going well, and then you just throw it away. Why? Don't know, miss. Well, something must be bothering you. I'm going to have to punish you, Rachel. You know that? Yes, miss. You don't seem too concerned. Yes? Excuse me, Miss Stewart. What is it, Mr. Fenner? I just heard about Rachel. I don't know if she's mentioned it, but she had some bad news today. - From her mother. - Oh? She's put Rachel's ten-month-old daughter into care. I see. I heard she was upset and I thought, well, maybe that's it. Thank you, Mr. Fenner. Sit down, Rachel. Why didn't you tell me? Is that what this is about? If you don't talk to me, how can I help you? - I'm still going to have to punish you. - Yes, miss. You can pay for the damage to your cell out your wages... and I'm withdrawing enhanced status immediately. I'm gonna put you back on the four-bed dorm on the Ones. What? You can think yourself lucky you're not going into Segregation. But that's where I should be sent, isn't it? Normally, yes. But in view of what's just happened... I'm going be lenient. You can thank Mr. Fenner for that. Rachel, are you sure there's nothing you're not telling me? Yes, miss. Well, I can't keep asking you. That'll be all, Rachel. Brought you some company. I wouldn't try your attention-seeking in here. I don't think Denny would appreciate it. No, miss. Rachel, this is a pleasant surprise. Make yourself at home. Where you been, Dom? Hiding? Sorry that I had a go at you back there. Forget about it. The guv wants us for a briefing. Look, I don't like this any more than you do. Then why lie to them? It's not really lying. Oh, right. It's just bending the truth, yeah? They'll want details. They'll want to know why she didn't go through with it. - What you gonna say then? - I'll think of something. See, the thing is, you've got to remember what we're dealing with here. Someone older than Miss Stewart, more secure in their job... we might get away with a warning. But she's new. She's going to cover her back. You know we could get sacked. Helen's not like that. Yeah, but Christ's sake, Dom. Why take the risk? Come on, if you don't care about yourself, then do it for me. I love my job. This is my life. Please, Dom. Nice cauliflower cheese tonight, Rachel. I only want tea. Nah, come on. You need building up after your little girl and that. Oh, yes, I heard about that, Rachel. I'm terribly sorry. Try a bit. You can always leave it if you don't like it. Oh, love. Do you want to have a chat about it? After supper, perhaps? No it's all right, ta. I'll be OK. Poor Rachel. Yeah. Poor Rachel. I was thinking- you might like something to help you sleep tonight. Perhaps you should see the nurse. Yeah, good idea. Has she got a loaded shooter? Only joking. Monica, any news about your appeal? Yes. We've got a date. My solicitor's quite optimistic. Oh, good. Well, keep me posted, huh? I don't know if I should say this. - It's Nikki Wade. - Oh. What's she done now? No, no, it's nothing bad. It's just she found out today her partner's met someone else. I see. She was talking about ending it all. I mean, she was joking, and she's tough as old boots, I know. But she did seem rather down. Well, thanks for mentioning it. We'll keep an eye on her. - You won't say I spoke to you? - Don't worry. You wanted a briefing on Zandra's abortion? Oh, yeah, yeah. Come in. Listen, before we start, Dominic... you're Rachel Hicks' personal officer, aren't you? Yeah, that's right. Have you noticed anything odd about her recently? Well, no, not really. But I've not seen much of her. I've been in Reception the last week. She smashed up her cell this afternoon. Rachel? You're joking. She'd just found out that her mother put her little girl into care. Oh, that's terrible. Come in. Look, there's nothing else going on, is there? Not that I'm aware of. Well, maybe you can talk to her before you go. - Yeah, sure. - I've had to put her back in Basic. Oh, listen, while you're here- Nikki Wade- she's very depressed, apparently. Girlfriend's just split up with her. Can you tell everyone to keep an eye on her? Yeah, sure. So, how did the abortion go? It didn't. What? She decided not to go through with it. - What, after all that? - Said she wanted to keep it. So the two of you have spent the whole day on a wild goose chase? Yeah. Something like that. I think I'm going to have to have words with Miss Plackett. - She was very upset, Miss Stewart. - Well, not as upset as I am! Anyway, she's entitled to change her mind, I suppose. But it all went OK apart from that? Yeah, no problems. Well, good. That's all. Oh, and, Dominic, you won't forget about Rachel, will you? No, I'll do it straightaway. Hi. I'm really sorry about your baby. Yeah, so is everyone. You don't do yourself any favors, you know. That cell was a privilege. Is there something I can do? Fix you up with the doctor, maybe? I don't need a doctor. I need to get off this landing. You were off this landing. You're back down here 'cause of what happened this afternoon. - So I smashed up a cell! - Listen, Rachel- You care more about poxy cells than you do about human beings in this place! Oh, I've got no time for this. I've been messed about enough today. We try to help, and we just get shat on. No, sir, wait. Nothing. Hop it, will you? Realized who your friends are now, then? Jim, I'm really sorry. That's not the way it sounded this afternoon. Why would I want to shag you? Christ... just look at yourself. Stop making that noise, will you, Denny? It's driving me mad. Yeah, shut it, Denny. I still don't understand why you trashed your cell like that, Rachel. I thought I'd get sent to punishment block. - I just want to be on my own. - You were on your own. Smashing up your cell like that won't help you, darling. The only one who'll lead you out of captivity is the Lord. Lord Longford, maybe. Him up there don't give a shit. That's blasphemy, Zandra. You'll go to hell for that. I bet she's crapping herself. Jeez. Are you going to be doing that all night? She's just had her baby taken into care, Denny. Have some patience. Well, she can always have another one. Get Jim to give you one. Look, I'll tell you one last time- stop crying! It's getting on my nerves! Bloody hell. Denny, leave her alone! Wimps. Come on, Den. Me arm's breaking. Come here, you twat. You dizzy cow, get it. Come on. Ow! Me arm's going. You got it? I've got it, Shell! Oh, sorry, Rachel. Have I woken you? - Has she seen it, Den? - I'm just giving her it. Who's going to do it, Den? You or me? You have a stab, Shell. I've got shaky hands. Why are you doing this to me? Nobody crosses Shell Dockley and lives. But I haven't done nothing to you. Who messes with Shell messes with me. Sweet dreams, darling. I want a detailed report on how this happened. - OK. - As soon as possible, please. The governor's called a meeting for tomorrow. He's got the press to deal with apart from anything else. They're gonna want to blame someone, I suppose. Well, excuse me, ma'am... but I don't think you can blame the PO's. It was Nikki Wade we were told to watch last night, not Rachel. Yeah, all right, Sylvia, thank you. That's a great help. We know that she was upset. That's why I put her in a dorm with three others- to prevent deliberate self-harm. I had no idea she was this desperate. I take it none of you did, either? - No. - No. Well, we need to get to the bottom of this as soon as we can. All right, come on. Let's go. Yes, ma'am. So much for the new regime. Things have changed, all right. We've got dead bodies on the wing. You can't blame Miss Stewart for that. Look at them. Bastards. You happy now? That the answer, eh? Bang us all up till we can't stand it anymore? Nikki. Give us all a body bag each when we come in... along with a blanket. Save you the effort, wouldn't it? Just muck out the cells now and again before the flies get stuck in! It was you lot killed Rachel. That's enough, Wade. Don't, Nikki. It won't do any good. It's all bullshit. Did that come from Trisha? Everybody bullshits. They can't get you no more, Rachel! That's it, Rach. You're best out of it! You're at peace now, girl! Not if she runs into my Uncle Norm, she's not! He was a right letch! Send him down here. I'll rub his itch. Have they no respect for the dead? Stay away from him, Rachel! They give you angel dust in heaven, don't they? What's the crack like up there, Rachel? Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once was lost But now I'm found Was blind But now I see Through many dangers Toils and snares I have already come 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far And grace will lead me home Yes, when this heart And flesh shall fail And mortal life shall cease I shall possess Within the veil A life of joy and peace
