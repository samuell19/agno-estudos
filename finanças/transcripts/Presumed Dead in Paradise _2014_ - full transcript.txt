All right, Madison. You ready for this? Come on. You said you can do this. If I don't pass this test, I'm gonna flunk Bio. We need the key to her office. The test is in there. I said I can do this, not that I would. Think of it as your initiation. New school, new rules. It's just about show time. Okay, stay 10 feet ahead of me. Stop and turn, then press down firmly. [ sighs ] Oh! - Oh, my gosh! - Oh! I'm so sorry. Oh, watch out! Here, clumsy. Maybe you can catch better than you can walk. Thank you, ladies. Thank you very much. Sorry again, Miss Lindel. Thank you. Okay, hold still. Got it. This better work. I don't wear Mary Janes. Then after Aspen, we're gonna spend New Year with my sister in the south of France. That's cool. Oh, it's gonna be hell. One week with my God-awful family? Family is the worst. Yeah, the worst. Well, at least I won't be spending my holiday with a tutor, thanks to you. You should have seen Miss Lindels' face when she handed me my test back. 98%. Glad I could help. How'd you learn how to do that stuff, anyway? I had to irritate my stepmom somehow. [ chuckles ] So what are you doing for the break? Oh, I'm actually going to India. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. It's this whole thing. We do it every year. I gotta go, Maddy. My mom's waiting for me downstairs. See ya'. Have a nice break! Yeah? Patricia. Hi. What are you doing here? I came to pick you up for break. I thought I was spending break here at school. You told me you made plans, remember? Well, my plans were always to be with you. But I wanted it to be a surprise, so surprise. Really? Yeah, really. I didn't want you to spend the holidays alone again this year. I know that we haven't spent much time together since your dad's accident. Yeah, and whose fault is that? [ sighs ] You know what? I didn't come here to argue. I think that we've both had enough of that. I'd really like to have a truce. Deal? Deal. So I've been thinking. Your 18th birthday is coming up soon and I thought that we should do something special for a change, just you and me. What did you have in mind? You remember that little island that we used to go to with your dad? Saint Isabel? A week in a tropical paradise, I just think it would do us both a world of good. Seriously? I'm serious, Maddy. Private beaches, spa days, yoga. I haven't been to Saint Isabel in a long time. Neither have I. Dad: Madison. Madison. Patricia: Madison? Madison? Madison? Madison. Hey, you were talking in your sleep. Oh, sorry. Were you dreaming? Yeah. Dad. I've had this one a million times before. You look just like him, you know. The same cheekbones. So is there anything in particular that you're looking forward to? - The fish. - The fish. Yeah. They have really good fish. And there's also this pastry shop that Dad loved right by the water. I forget the name exactly. It was Fresbyteria... something. Anyway, Dad would always talk politics with the owner and I'd go play soccer with his kid. I know I've been tough to deal with lately. Is that why you sent me away? Because I was a troublemaker? Is that what you really think? Madison, I was so broken when your father died. I didn't know how to be a mother to you. So you just sent me away? Well, at the time, I thought it was the best decision. I'd never been a mother before. I could barely stay afloat, let alone be a suitable parent. The least I could do was provide you with the best education. Are you okay? Yeah, fine. Just gonna run to the restroom real fast. Oh, sorry. No problem. Ladies and gentlemen, we have initiated our descent into the island of Saint Isabel. Please ensure your seatbelt is securely fastened and your seat back and tray tables are in their full upright and locked position. All right. This should only take a sec. Can I come with you? I'm only gonna be a minute, I promise. I'll be right back. Story of my life. [ knocking on car window ] I got 'em! We're at the beach villa up the road. We're here. This is beautiful. Go on in. Are you glad to be back? Yes. God, it's been years. Saint Isabel reminds me so much of your dad. Wow, this is nothing like the shack Dad used to own. Yeah, well, I wanted it to be different for our time together. This is so cool. You know what? I love room service. I think we should order some and binge. Really? Anything you want, as much as you want. Okay. [ chuckles ] Thanks again for bringing me here, Patricia. It's my pleasure, Madison. Well, I really mean it. Look, we've already been here a whole day. And we haven't even had a fight yet. [ chuckles ] That's true. I'd say we're making progress. Well, here's to our time together. Patricia? I'm starving. Let's get some breakfast. Back in a few hours. Check out these cool earrings. Hmm. Well, so much for our time together. [ child laughs ] Over here, Andres. I'm open. [ laughs ] Goal! Madison! Madison! Hi. Do you speak any English? No. Do you have this in any other colors? No, no... [ speaking Spanish ] I think I can help you. Which color do you want? Red. Red? [ speaking Spanish ] Mm-hmm. [ speaking Spanish ] Perfect. Oh, no, no, no. Please, let me. Oh, thanks. You don't have to do that. Well, I don't usually. But it's my pleasure. - Gracias. - Gracias. Thanks again. You're welcome. - Bye. - Senor? Oh, thank you. De nada. Hi. You want to join us? - Ola! - Ola! Come have a drink with us! Tempting, but no thank you. - Come on. - This is a nice bike. What are you doing? Maybe she's too good for you. Maybe both of us will be too good for her. Get your hands off of me! Hey! Leave her alone! Let him go, please! Oh, my God! [ grunts ] Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You're bleeding. A young woman like you shouldn't be out here alone. I can handle myself. I'm Madison, by the way. Blake. Welcome to Saint Isabel. Still look pretty shaken up. Hey, let me take you back to your hotel. We can throw your bike right on the back of my jeep. What are you, like James Bond or something? [ chuckles ] Hanging out rescuing tourist girls and solving crimes? [ laughs ] Uh, let's just say I'm protecting a potential investment. I'm a guide, actually. I run a little business in town. I take tourists on jungle excursions, rock climbing, surfing. I used to come here years ago with my dad. It's been years since I've been here. Thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Lots of excitement for one day, huh? Lots of excitement. You know, I have to be back around here in the early morning. I have a surfing lesson with some tourists from Chicago. I could be back around noon if you want. Show you some more of the island. To protect your investment, right? Right. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. - See you at noon. - Okay, great. I'll see you then. Cool. Madison, are you okay? Where have you been? I was just gonna call the hotel security. Who was that? Some guy who helped me. There was a little incident. What do you mean? Some guys tried to jump me. But it's fine. Nothing happened. Look, I really need you to not go out on your own again, okay? Okay. So trying to be a mommy now? So how much do you actually know about this guy? He's local and he's nice. And he's just gonna take me around to see the island tomorrow. He's way too old for you. Have you seen my bag? Yeah. It's right here. Have you been looking through my stuff? Yes. I was looking through your stuff. You've been gone all day. You've been off your medication. And I was worried about you. I'm not a kid anymore. I can see that. Please, everyone has a fake ID. Madison, I know what it's like when you're young and you meet a good-looking guy. You know, Patricia, it's a little late for you to be pulling the parent card. I'm just saying you never know who you can trust, that's all. [sighs] So have you ever been paddle-boarding before? Never, but I think I can handle it. Cool. Well, looks like we've got the place all to ourselves other than the dog. Yeah. Where is everyone? That's why you come here. No distractions. All right. I have a treat for you. Ta-da! I made it myself. It is papaya and guava juice mixed with a little bit of coconut water. It'll help prevent seasickness. Okay. I hope that's legal. They're mild. I just... I take them for my anxiety. Why? Does the water make you nervous? People make me nervous sometimes. Okay. Here. I'll need... Let me take that back. - Here you go. - Thank you. Okay. I'm gonna go check out the water. All right. I'm gonna start unpacking the gear. What happens if we get caught in the rip tide? Don't worry. We'll stay clear of the rip. Here. Put this on. I can swim. Yeah, I noticed. But it can get pretty choppy out there. - Okay. - Come on, come on. Oh, this thing is heavy. Oh, that's because you're used to the flimsy life vests they have for swimming pools and lakes. This is an open water life vest. And it's safe up to a Cat 3 hurricane. So you're fine. Got it. [ laughs ] Madison! Follow me out to the break! I'll wait for you out there! Got it! This is amazing! You're a natural, Madison! Hey, follow me! ere's a good spot for watching dolphins! Okay! Blake? Over here, Madison! Slow down! Madison? Blake? Blake? Slow down! I don't feel very... oh! [ pants ] Uh! Oh, no, the pirate stole your birthday present. Don't be silly, Daddy, you did this. Well, it's a good thing that they left a map. I know where the treasure is. That's right. Your mother gave that to me. She said it was the key to her heart. Now I'm giving it to you. I'm so sorry, Madison. Madison! Madison! [ gasping ] Hello? Is anybody there? Ola! My pills. Okay. Nothing to be scared of. [ panting ] Oh. [ engine approaching ] Hey! Stop, please. Hi. Can I get a ride to my hotel? - Yeah. - Thank you. [ panting ] Patricia? I'm back. Hello? Hello? Is anyone home? Patricia? Hello? Is anyone here? Hello. Front desk. May I help you? Hi. This is Madison from Bungalow Seven. Do you know if Patricia Ashland is out looking for me? Let me check the messages. Uh, no, ma'am. No messages for Bungalow Seven. Has anyone called the police or filed a missing persons report or something? Uh, no. No record of that. I am sorry. Okay. Well, if you see her, can you tell her I called? Of course. Did you want me to call someone for you? I can call the police and put. Wait. Never mind.. She's here. I see her. Okay. [ laughter ] Tell me everything. Tell me what happened. Was it just like we discussed? Even better than planned. Really? Mm-hmm. No signs of bodily harm, like an accident. [ laughs ] How do you know? Did you see her body go under? Oh, yeah. She went straight to the bottom. You know the weight vest, the pills you switched out? I mean, maybe the drugs didn't take hold in time. - No, no, no, no. - Did you check to make sure? Yeah. I waited for a while. And she never came back up. What about the vest? 'Cause you were supposed to collect the vest. The vest? I mean, that's gonna draw suspicion. It's fine. I handled it. I know what I'm doing. What do you mean? If, like, Madison's body just washes up on some shore? On some beach for all these tourists to see? 'Cause that would be great for low profile, Blake. Would you relax? I mean, if you're so concerned about it, then why would you even bring her down here? I mean, we could have pulled this whole thing off without a body count. I can't relax and I can't file a missing persons report until Monday. So until then, I need to keep everything nice and clean, okay? What about her real mother? Her aunt? Uncle? I mean, that's the only thing we need to worry about. Her mom died when she was a baby. She doesn't have any relatives. Does she have a boyfriend? She has no one. I'm gonna go to her room and get some things, okay? Blake? Yeah? They didn't leave us any fresh towels. Honey, you're supposed to leave the towels you want replaced on the floor. It's environmental. Well, I'm gonna call the front desk. Front Desk? May I help you? Hi. Can we have some fresh towels, please, in Bungalow Seven? Of course. We'll send some right over. Oh, but you have a message. A Madison Ashland called looking for you? What? Just a few moments ago. What's wrong? Madison? Madison, are you okay? I've been so worried about you. Where have you been? We gotta get you out of those wet clothes. And get you into a nice warm, hot bath, all right? Okay? Don't let her get away! I need some help! Habla Englais? I don't speak Spanish. What's the matter? Someone tried to kill me. [ sighs ] I lost her. What are we gonna do? We've gotta move up the plan. I know, but it's all true. Look, Miss Ashland, you don't have any money, no identification. No one to corroborate your story. Is there anything else you can tell me? I need more to go on. I told you everything I know. I don't know why she's doing this to me. Excuse me. [ speaking Spanish ] Is this the detective? [ speaking Spanish ] There she is. That's the girl. - That's my stepmother! - You need to calm down. Are you the detective here? Esos correcto. Well, I'm sorry, detective. But this girl has been stalking me. She broke into my hotel room. She's insistent that we're related. And I'm afraid that she might be involved with some gangs or something. What? She tried to kill me. She isn't your stepdaughter? No. I can't believe you. I thought you actually wanted a relationship with me. Can anyone else validate your story? Yes. Madison, can you come in here, please? This... This is my stepdaughter. And she can clarify anything you need to know. Hi. I'm Madison Ashland. No, you're not! I'm Madison! She's lying! Oh, sorry. Wait, wait! She's in on it too! I remember seeing her on the airplane! Anyway, she left this after we had to chase her out. - Is this your bag? - Yeah. Susan Greenburg? Is this you? No. I mean, yeah, that's my fake ID. Well, looks like a criminal to me. I can't believe you're doing this. You lying, evil bitch! - Grab her! - Hey, hey, enough. Enough. Is this how you treat your tourists here? I'm sorry, ma'am. But I'm gonna have to see your daughter's passport to clear this up. Madison. Here. Seems official. No, that's a fake! I'm Madison Ashland! Look, whoever you are, I'm sorry. But you've got some serious issues. [ speaking Spanish ] Si, Senor. No. What are you doing? I'm sorry, ma'am. You and your daughter are free to go. - What about her? - We'll take care of her. Look, I want you to know that we're not gonna feel safe until she's been put in jail. On Monday, I'm gonna be calling the U.S. Consulate in the mainland and they're skilled in dealing with situations like this. I hope so. Thank you. Shh, shh, shh. But the U.S. Consulate. You think this passport will hold up? I mean, what if they have her fingerprints or something? Just keep it together, Taylor, okay? But the cops think I'm her. Listen, we talked about this, remember? There was bound to be some heat. Look, I would not have gotten you into this if I did not think that you could handle it. But you asked for this, Taylor, a chance to start again. I didn't mean anything by it, Patricia. I can keep my cool. Don't worry about the Consulate. We'll be long gone by the time they get here. Okay, get in the car. I'm sorry, ma'am. But we're gonna have to detain you at least for the night. It's for your own safety. You're a danger to Miss Ashland and possibly yourself. I can bring a doctor to examine you in the morning. You're locking me up? Don't I get a lawyer or something first? I want to believe you. Sign her in as Jane Doe for now. Yes, sir. Let's go. Ow! Come on. Come on, get up. It's not that bad. Can I at least use the restroom first? [ sighs ] Okay. It's right over there. Go. Don't take too long. [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Okay. What? Invalid? [ sighs ] What? Ugh. Hmm. Let's see. Yes! All right, she's gone. They can't find her anywhere. I can't believe they let her escape. Maybe she's smarter than you think. Do you have her fingerprints? I think so. We need an actual fingerprint for this form. - I know. - Not just the photo. Watch and learn. Perfect. [ chuckles ] I'm sorry, Miss. We're closed for the night. I know, but can I please just speak to the owners? I knew them when I was... when I was younger. I'm sorry. Can I sit down? Yeah, yeah, of course. Sit. I'm sorry, but you don't look well. I mean, who is she gonna talk to? Well, she's running wild around the island, Blake. That's fine, that's fine. Everybody thinks she's crazy. And, I mean, we have until Monday, which is, what, 36 hours? - Yeah. - Right. You think Madison might try to kill me? No. I know Madison. She'd rather run than face her own fears. Guys, we need to find her. Taylor. Faces and Friends, fraud alert. I think I may have something. She tried to log into her account. I thought you already hacked into it. I did, but now when anyone tries to access it, we'll be able to find their location. Can you get an address? Working on it. Got it. It's an internet café at 2001 Marco Esquandalas Avenue. Okay, okay. I'm on it. Hello, Madison. How do you know my name? It's on your pendant. Here. This is good. What is it? Chocolatina. My father used to make it for us as kids. After long days playing on the beach with old friends. Wait. Only my initials are on this thing. How do you know my name? Madison! Andres? Oh, my God! [ speaks Spanish ] Thanks, Andres. You really didn't have to make me dinner. When was the last time you ate? A while. I could hear your stomach growling from across the room. [ growls ] [ laughs ] It's been a couple of days. I know how crazy this all must sound. It's okay. Everyone has problems. I don't judge people. It's just... Patricia was all the family that I had left in the world. After my dad died, she moved me from school to school so I couldn't make any friends. Then all of a sudden, she wanted to take me on this vacation? I thought things were finally changing. Yeah. Sounds like she kept moving you around on purpose, right? I should have known better. So do you believe me? It's a complicated story. I've been talking about myself this entire time. I'm sorry. You lost your parents too, didn't you? It was Hurricane Edward a few years ago. That must have been hard for you. It was hard for everyone. A lot of people lost everything. Well, you must think I'm a spoiled American. [ chuckles ] Si, un poquito. Yeah. You just don't understand the way things work around here. Well, this was delicious. Gracias. [ chuckles ] You know, someday this will be a real restaurant. I believe you. Look, you can stay here. But I don't think I'd be a very good witness for you. Why not? My story is complicated, too. Right. Yeah, I know it's a lot to ask. Do you remember now? Stall number four. You can't just live the rest of your life as a fugitive. So what are you gonna do? Patricia brought me here to kill me. But why here? There's something I'm not seeing. Maybe your father left you something, some money that you don't know about. Well, my birthday's tomorrow. I can't imagine the timing of all of this being accidental. If I could just figure that out, I could blow Patricia's story to shreds. Maybe there's something back at the villa that could help. Now she's gonna be watching out for you. I know. I just... I need you to distract Patricia long enough so I can search the bungalow. Is that all? Come on, please? I'll help you, but you have to promise me if somebody bad happens, you won't give up. Swear on your little keychain. I swear. [ chuckles ] How are we gonna get them out of there? Leave that up to me. Look, take this phone, wait for my signal. [ speaking Spanish ] I'm gonna take them out of there and I'm gonna let you know when they're coming back, okay? - Okay. - How long are you gonna need? I'm not even sure what I'm looking for, you know. Just whatever you're going to do, do it fast, okay? Thank you. You're welcome. Hello? - Hi. - Blake: Hey. Where have you been? Out. Anyway, I went to this internet café. And she was here for sure. Besides the Faces and Friends log-in, the only other search is for a pastry shop in old Saint Isabel. Does that ring a bell? A pastry shop. Hold on a sec. Yeah. Madison still talks about that place. Jordan used to take her there when she was a kid. I can't find the contacts. Why is that important? Don't you see, Blake? She needs an ally right now. She's probably looking for a friend or something, like that little boy that she used to play with when she was a kid. Yeah, well, I'm here now, Patricia. And there is no more shop. So whoever owned this place is long gone. She can't be far. Just keep looking. Just keep asking the locals or something. Blake, look, you're the professional here, okay? I'm just gonna let you do your job. Patricia! Patricia! What? Detective Cortez is in the lobby. He wants to speak with us. Like, now! I gotta call you back. Wait. I... You don't have very much time. You need to hurry. Okay, so what do I say to Cortez? Uh, don't say anything unless he asks you. Yeah? They're in the lobby. I don't know for how long. Did you find anything yet? No. I need more time. Hurry up. They're coming to you. Distract them! Where's my car? Where's my... Where's my blue car, please? Hey, I know you from someplace, right? Madison, Madison Ashland. It's me, Andres. Andres Castillo. Madison. Oh my God. You do remember me, don't you? Uh, no. Sorry. We used to play together as kids. My father had a pastry shop. She's here. Wait. What? Who's here? Madison. She's here. She's here right now. Can I get my car, please? [ panting ] Andres! I think I found it! I think this is it! [ Patricia sighs ] Uh, Patricia? Is she gonna kill us? Ow! I'm too young to die! What do we do? No! Damn it! She's got the envelope. What? Go find her! - Me? - Go! Blake: Hi, Patricia. Blake? Madison got the envelope. Right here. What is it? It's a release form for a safety deposit box. And they have my fingerprint. For which bank? Bank of Saint Isabel. There are four of those here on the island. So it'd help if we knew which one. It doesn't say. What's in the box? I'm not sure, but these other papers are my dad's stock and mutual fund transactions from about 10 years ago. It looks like he cashed out a bunch of stocks before he died. But here's the catch. Whatever's in that box, I'm supposed to collect at the bank on my 18th birthday. Patricia must have thought that he cashed out all of his shares and left them to me. God, how long has she been planning this? Come on, we have to go. Come on, come on. You didn't find them? They must be somewhere in the jungle. Well, now what? What are you thinking? Your dad wouldn't just put a bunch of cash in a safety deposit box, would he? I don't think so. Run! [ speaks Spanish ] You've run out of places to hide, Madison. I know you're here. [ grunts ] Run, Madison! [ grunting ] Oh! [ shouts ] [ grunts ] No! Let me go! Andres! - Andres! - Shut up! Blake: Shut up, shut up! Come out! I got your gun! I got your girl! Let her go! Blake, let her go! If you touch her... So you finally got her. Did she put up a fight? You tell me. You don't mind if I borrow this, do you? If you're gonna kill me, that's the gun I want you to have. You were looking for this? Oh, my. You deserve a bonus for this. Let's just finish this. You've always been so clever, Madison. Do you even know what this is? It's mine. That belongs to me. It's something that you don't deserve. My father gave it to me! Why so entitled, Madison? You act like you're the only one that he ever loved. He loved me too. Why are you doing this to me? Because you left me no choice. What are you talking about? We could have been a family, Madison, a real family. You know that that's all I ever wanted. Oh, my God, you're delusional. I extended myself to you so many times. But you just shut me out. No, you didn't! You sent me away! I spent all of those holidays alone! But you knew what you were doing this whole time. You meant to hurt me. It was never about what you thought was best for me. It was about your pride, wasn't it? Because you knew no matter how hard you tried, he would never love you as much as he loved me. You were an embarrassment to him. I can't believe you share the same DNA. Yes, Taylor? [ sobs ] Come Monday morning when the bank opens, we're gonna be home free. Patricia, I'm really worried. I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this. Taylor, I'm on my way home, okay? Oh, just hurry back, please? I can't take this much longer. I think I'm having a panic attack. We good? Taylor's hysterical. Don't worry. I can handle it. What do you want me to do about Madison? End it. Just remember, before you bury her body, send me the proof. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Hello, Madison. You don't have to kill just because she told you to. I'm not afraid of using a gun. Patricia convinced you that it's necessary. But it's not. Is that what you think? Hmm? I don't do what she tells me to do. Then why didn't she just come kill me herself? She's using you to do all of her dirty work. Don't you see that? She's setting you up. Stop talking. Think about it. What if my body accidently gets found? She's got no connection to you. But you've probably got a record, right? She can go and tell the police that, I don't know, that I was working with you by blackmailing her and claiming to be her daughter. All right, shut up. And then it's your word against hers and who do you think they would believe? Hey! Shut up! She's been planning on killing me for years. Do you honestly think that she met you and thought that you were her soul mate? You're just a part of her plan, too. You're just trying to save your life. Hell, yeah, I'm trying to save my life! I'm just trying to live one more day! I don't care about the money! You can have all of it! Just keep me alive one more day or one more week for when Patricia finally decides to turn on you. 'Cause you know that she's going to, don't you? You do! Blake, I'm your ace in the hole! Shut up! Damn it! [ crying ] No, no. It's done. Okay. I need to see the proof. Jesus, I said it's done. I'm not texting you pictures over an unsecured phone. It's okay, baby. I trust you. We're in this together. Just show me in the morning. I need you to be on the lookout at the bank, though, all right? Blake? Blake? [ grunts ] [ shrieks ] [ grunts ] Bank of Saint Isabel, 9 a.m. [ speaking Spanish ] Damn it, Blake, where are you? What? Something's wrong, isn't it? We have to be smart about this, Taylor. Whatever happens, I can handle it. Well, what if he got caught and told the cops? They'll be waiting for us at the bank. Now why would he do that? Taylor, you need to calm down. Or she killed him. She killed him and now she's out there waiting to kill us too! No, no, no. You're overestimating her, Taylor. And Blake is probably out celebrating, getting drunk or something. Come on, let's go. Doesn't Blake have a truck? Where is it? I'm gonna wait here. Blake? [ groans ] Where is she? Where is she? [ groans ] [ gagging ] What happened? They're gone. Both of them. What do we do now? First we gotta get to the bank. Then we gotta get to the airport. And then after that, we'll be home free. It'll take 60 minutes tops. First I gotta make a call. Uh-huh, yeah, that's right. The crazy girl everyone's been talking about? No, I'm from the states. I'm here with my sorority. - She was covered in blood. - Yes. There's a problem. We saw her in Saint Isabel somewhere. Her clothes were covered in blood. It was disgusting. Yes, yes, okay. Thank you. And just keep a lookout. 'Cause I think she's dangerous. Okay, bye. I think she's close. That could be anything. Do you think she knows which bank? Blake could have told her. Let's just get to the bank. Door's locked. Patricia? What? Patricia? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hi. - Good morning. We need to access our safety deposit box, please. - Of course. - Thank you. Please follow me. It's been a long time. Almost 10 years. I know. Madison's just turned 18. And it's amazing how time flies. My husband and I were always very fond of this place. I was very sad when I heard about Senor Ashland. He was a very good man. Yeah. It was devastating to all of us. And it was actually really difficult for us to come down here with all the memories and everything. I understand. Well, hopefully, we can relieve some of your hardship today, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Everything seems to be in order. But for the thumbprint, we'll need to do that here. Of course. Right here, please? There. I did it. You know, it's been years. I just was wondering if the thumbprint stays similar. You'd be surprised. Very well then. I'll be right back in a moment with your box. Great. Here you are. We have a private room where you can open it. Oh, actually, can we open it here? 'Cause we're in a bit of a rush. - Of course. - Thank you. [ gasps ] Yeah, it is. Could you get my purse, please? I have the key to that box! Miss! Well, then you obviously stole it. No! My father left that for me! Look, sir, this woman is a fugitive and a criminal. And I really think that we need to call the police. You have my thumbprint, right? Yeah? Here. Check this. If I'm wrong, you can arrest me. These match, too. I don't understand. Here. Feel free to check. They seem normal. Now check her hands. Madison, it's okay. Just stay away from her. Whoever you are, you're not gonna get away with this.

"Princess, so you've reached the end of this journey. And so begins the start of another. As you transition into adulthood, be sure to cherish all the blessings you receive and honor them by giving back. Because this life is your journey.
