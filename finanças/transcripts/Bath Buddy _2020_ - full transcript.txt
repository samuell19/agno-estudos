All across China, all throughout Chinese history, bathing culture has always existed, and has even developed its own system. For instance, the rubdown stimulates blood circulation by soothing your veins with primitive energies of the universe. There's a whole philosophy to it. Craftsmanship is what really matters here, not the profit. Su Dongpo, the great Chinese poet once wrote "Dear masseur, you have been scrubbing all day, "Easy, easy, for I was not at all filthy." Look, after all the stuff I moved out, can we call it a day? Not yet. Get me those koi carps as well. That's right, both of them. I'll put them in the box then. Here you are. Zhou, you've been busy all day. You must be exhausted. Nah, it's okay! You owe me two months' salary. What I'm taking from you is not that much, is it? Nope. Not at all. You can take anything in this house that you like. No, thank you. There is nothing left except for the drains. There's no space left in my truck. I do enjoy a room as empty as possible. You know what, Zhou? You could've been nicer the first time. Well, I didn't expect you to bring so many friends today. I've been working for you for a year. Scrubbing is not really my thing, but I learned a lot from you especially on making friends. You're too kind. I think it's fair to say that you taught yourself. - So, I guess this is goodbye. - Goodbye. Cool. See you. Guys. No need to use force today. Let's go. That's right. Off you go! Zhou. About that message on the wall, I'm afraid you have to clean it yourself. No worries, I'll take care of it. Goodbye. My throat feels a bit sore. A hate note? Fine. But in red paint, are you serious? "Hole in debt"? JERK IN DEBT I see, it's "jerk in debt." The best scrub masseur in town, Zhou Donghai, is this his place? - He's dead. - Dead? I have a job for him. Poor guy died so young. Watch your mouth. Stop right there. What job are you talking about? I'm here for a survey and location search. Unlike you, sitting around doing nothing. The advertising video... Are you knuckleheads still racing cars? Let daddy show you what a real man plays. Wingsuit flying. I've checked out the ad. Now, it's your call. All this bathing culture and spiritual rubbish... sounds too much like a hoax. It's just lame. And this part about rebirth? How would taking a bath help with that? No problem. I'll have them remake it. And also... Mr. Jin wants to talk to us about the Hot Spring Town project. - The president of Golden Pool? - Exactly. He's such a jerk. But a very successful one. Successful? He made it by poaching my employees and telling everyone that I, Xiao Xiang am nothing but a mascot. He also said that he knows nothing about this business. And it's such a waste to have sent him abroad. Don't interrupt me while I'm talking. Cousin. We can totally do this project ourselves. - But the capital chain... - Hey, where is the scrub guy? He's here. What are you doing? What is wrong with you? How could you eat directly after a foot massage? Am I smiling at you? Go get ready. Let's go. I see. You hired a local scrub masseur for the research. A much better approach than mine. No. It's just for relaxing before wingsuit flying. What were you thinking? I'm here for fun. Look at this. So shiny. Are you done sterilizing? Sterilizing what? Your hands. Sterilize them first. Who knows what germs you have on you? There's the sterilizer. And? Wait, just hang on a sec. After I'm done scrubbing, you can give this herbal bath bag a try. It will refresh your body and soul and fill you with energy. Oops, you got a scar here. That's none of your business. There are at least nine stitches. I have to avoid this area. Cut the crap and get to work. Sure thing. Where are you from, bro? I'm not your bro. - Behave yourself. - You must be a very successful young man, and very experienced at the same time. But I bet you have no idea about my skills. Oh, really? While scrubbing your body, I'm also giving you a thorough massage. - Have you heard of Bathingham Palace? - Sure! The biggest communal-bath franchise in the country. Except now, it is going down the drain. - What do you mean? - Ever since the old boss died. - I... - I heard his son is a playboy - and is nothing but a mascot. - I... The experienced masseurs have all left. Mark my word, Bathingham Palace will go down with mascot boy in charge. Who are you calling a mascot? BATHINGHAM PALACE I'm so sorry. So, you are the... You are the play... Playful hardworking chairman, Mr. Xiao! Didn't you say this herb cures everything? Here, cleanse your potty mouth with it. Mr. Xiao, what a great sense of humor. This is for external use only. Do you think I'm joking? It's your bath water. I'd rather die than drink it. You've got some balls. I only offered you a cup, but you preferred the whole tub. Enjoy the taste? Fine. I drank the water and effectively amused you. Now pay up. Do you want money? Where do you even find the nerve? I worked and I deserve to be paid. You are just a fraud. Listen, kid. I scrubbed more men than you've ever met. Now cut the crap and pay me. Come on. Get lost. What is the matter with you? So you're robbing me, now that your little skit failed? Come here, Uncle Wang. Nobody even bothers to answer to you. Who the heck do you think you are? Without your daddy, you're no better than a piece of trash. Get lost! You have to pay me first. Otherwise, you're going nowhere. Where are you going? Stop. What are you doing? Pay up. Get lost! Jerk! You little jerk! Watch your mouth! Jerk! Mascot boy. Drive. Jerk! If I ever see your face again, I... I will definitely... Jerk! Who are you? It's me, Donghai. Your grandson. Grandson? This is my homemade herbal medicine, which is good for your feet and brain. - Medicine? - Medicine. No, Grandma. You can't eat it. You soak your feet in it. - But I have to take medicine. - Sure you do. Grandson, come rescue me. This man won't let me take my medicine. He won't let me. All right, you can take your medication after this. I have to take medicine. Donghai, what do you think of my drawing? It looks exactly like me. No way. This is my idol. I thought I was your idol. There is no need to draw anyone else. Does he have anything to do with you? Does he even know you? Whatever. You'd better make him your provider! Spoiled brat. DONGHAI BATHHOUSE Even a scrub masseur from nowhere dares to call me a mascot. Just wait until this whole town becomes a hot spring resort. They'll be lining up to work for you. To nail down such a big project, we do need some external support, financially and... My brother, if you got my back, then all is well. Together, there is nothing we can't conquer. Someday, maybe we'll even buy out that Jin guy. POTENTIAL COOPERATOR, GOLDEN POOL My brother, are you okay? I'm just afraid of heights. Here, take this. XIAO XIANG I wear it every time I fly. It helps me overcome the fear. I don't think I should. We can share everything. You just take a good look at our future empire. I got you. See you in a bit. Mr. Zhong. It is bad weather for parachuting. It's okay. He's a mascot boy. He won't die. BATHHOUSE PHYSICAL THERAPY TO REDUCE STRESS Who would do something like this? Hey, look. Isn't that you? This is deepfake. I can be anyone I want. Slimmer and with longer legs. You don't look so good with long legs. Like an ostrich. What's wrong with your eyes? Now, quit it. I'll fix this in a minute. Then we'll take grandma to the hospital. Doctor, my grandma keeps mistaking other people for me. She doesn't even recognize me. Also, the prescription you gave was not good because she's actually getting worse. Didn't I tell you? You should take her to a bigger hospital. She's got Alzheimer's, the so-called senile dementia. I can't help her. Next, please. Please wait a minute. Take a look at my hand. I fell from a bus yesterday and twisted it. It hurts a lot. Can I still scrub people? You must rest for at least three months. - Where the heck am I? - Which ward? - He never seems to stop. - Who is that? The one they salvaged from the river? - Yes, he might have brain damage. - Help. - So annoying. - Here, let me take your temperature. Stop there! I need you to cooperate. The heck, I'm not sick. Really? Why don't you tell me your name then? My name is... - Where are you from? - I'm from... Here, eat something first. And take your pills afterwards. Your brother is on his way here. Is this for pigs? Besides, have you sterilized the sheets? Germs everywhere. SILENT The second room on the left. Bed 232. Dissociative amnesia can be a real pain in the bum. Every day, I eat and sleep and eat again. Did I say you could touch me? So he doesn't remember anything? Nope, nothing at all. Not even his name or home address. Just now, he kicked over his lunchbox. But his body functions are good. You can take him home. Don't you guys wipe your drool on me. It was a mistake. I don't know this man. You don't? I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Who was that? His family? Unlikely. Didn't the police say they would send his brother here today? Serves you right. The other day, you said you'll be selling the bathhouse. To who? Mr. Liu is buying bathhouses. I asked him to come around. Who will take in a bathhouse out of business? I'll bring in business! And good business means good price. You can't even crack open an egg, let alone bring the bathhouse back to life. I'll bring in a man. Only an idiot would come work at our bathhouse. Keep walking. Idiot... You take grandma home. - Where are you going? - To get us the man. - Hello. - Mr. Zhong. Maybe we should put up posters for a missing person. - I've searched around the mountain. - Keep a low profile. We don't want to cause a fuss inside the company. Then I guess I'll just keep searching. How are the purchases going? Last month, I got this local guy named Liu to make the arrangements. Keep your mouth shut about the project, in case those shabby bathhouses raise their price. Understood. Come here. Your brother's here to take you home. This is his brother? That's right. Who are you? I'm your brother. You're not my brother. I don't even know you. He seems to be fine. You can go home with your brother now. Doctor, I told you. I don't know him. I'd better be out of here then. You must be patient. He's lost all his memory. Stop. Wait. If you are my brother, tell me my name. Our last name is Zhou, and you're Zhou Mascot. What kind of stupid name is that? Think about it. Does "mascot boy" ring a bell? Sounds familiar. Where are my parents? They both died in a car accident a few years ago. Now there is just grandma, our little sister, you, and me. The four of us live together. Wait. Why would our family have so many kids? Go to hell and ask them directly. I don't know. - What the heck was that? - What the heck did you say, you jerk? - What did I say? - That's enough, both of you. The both of you should behave yourselves. Here in the hospital, there are other patients around. Sir. Do you know anything that no one else knows? Just tell him one of those and he'll believe you. Take your time, but don't take too long. You have a scar on your butt. That's impossible. Go check it yourself. He was so naughty that I kicked his bum. Count the stitches. Eight or nine, but not more than ten. It's been so long that I forgot. He was too upset after getting rejected by a girl. Heartbroken. No wonder. This one's a little troublemaker, I'm telling you. You're back. It's real. You're my brother. Of course I am. Hey, if you prefer to stay here, so be it. You can get better soon if you go back to a familiar environment and spend time with your family. Should I check his profile for family info? Haven't you had enough of this craziness? Just send them away. See, don't we look alike? - Like twins. - Absolutely. What is this place? You were born and raised here. WELCOME TO DONGHAI BATHHOUSE Come, take a look. This is our home. It's quite spacious, right? Do you guys live in a pool? What is wrong with you? This is the backyard. See, the cowpeas, baskets, fish. - Familiar, right? - Who is this? It's grandma. Greet her, quickly. - Whose grandma? - Ours. No, it's your grandma. - Watch your mouth. - I... Let Grandma look at you. I'll make you a fancy meal. Just for you. So, how did I lose my memory? You were a gambler. You owed someone money and they came after you. So, you jumped into a river. I owed someone money? Look here. That's your creditors' great work. "Hole in debt"? He means, jerk. No, this can't be right. What can't be right? Four ones to four fives, you drink. I don't know how to gamble. I only roll dice. Exactly. Gambling with dice. Some online casino with hot chick dealers. That's your thing. If it weren't for your creditors, my hand wouldn't be like this. Did they beat you up? Actually, my hand got swollen after slapping their faces too hard. Be quiet! I cannot focus on my drawing. Quit it then. Come here. This was the guy who ripped me off. He owes me 300 yuan for the scrubbing session. And he broke my hand, which costs 6,000 yuan for my lost labor. So, he'll work here for three months. What? But you... Be quiet. Come with me. - You can't do that. - Of course I can. He lost his memory? Seriously? Sit down. What's worse is, his family has abandoned him. So I took him in. Are you out of your mind? What if he gets his memory back? Then I'll just send him back. No big deal. No, you can't do that. I'll report it to the police. I'm calling them now. Where are my clothes? Where are my clothes? Such a cute guy. Who are you? I'm Xixi. Xixi. Are you tired, baby? I'll get you some water. Baby? I call him Big brother, and you, Baby brother. You have been away for such a long time. No one's taking me to school anymore. You haven't forgotten me, have you? Baby brother? Come here, you. - Do you want clothes? - Yes. There's plenty in that room. Go pick one. Go, go, go. Feeling much better now with your clothes? Are these my clothes? Sure it is. Only an idiot would wear this! Watch your attitude. This is high fashion. Where do I sleep? You used to sleep in my room. But then you got yourself in debt and I had to sell the bunk bed. For now, you can sleep in the pool or the scrub room. HARMONY BRINGS WEALTH - What is this? - For sweeping. - What, you want to fly on it? - I do the sweeping? My brother, you heard the doctor. You should get back to your normal life as soon as possible. It helps you recover quicker. Right? Wear it like this. MEN'S Xixi. Come out. What are you doing? Don't yell at me. I was doing my homework. In the men's bathroom? He is even cuter when he's sweeping the floor. Give me that. What did you draw? I wish your teacher knew how hard you work. Well, you're making him work so hard. Traitor. Cleaning is such an easy gig. Stupid. SAVE WATER BE CAREFUL OF THE SLIPPERY FLOOR Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? I'm cleaning. More like exploding. Well, those were your words. The harder I work, the sooner I'll recover. Check this out. It's clogged. Clogged? I'm clogged! How am I supposed to open for business tomorrow? Zhou. Zhou. I'm here for a tour. Mr. Liu. You're here! How much is my bathhouse worth? - I'm leaving. - No, please. Mr. Liu. Hold on. Please take a look around. - I'm not interested in garbage. - Forgive me, please. Usually, there would be more people. What people? You don't even have a scrub masseur. Are you kidding me? No, but I do have one. That guy right there. Isn't he a cleaner? Same thing. With some training, he can scrub in no time. You are wasting my time. I'll come back next month. Such a dump. Do come back next month. I'll have this place all cleaned up. Zhou Donghai. This is clogged too. - Where? - Here. That's because of a towel. HOT, COLD ♪ Pat yourself on the chest ♪ ♪ And get back on your feet ♪ ♪ No need to feel upset ♪ ♪ Pat yourself on the chest ♪ ♪ And get back on your feet ♪ You know what? This couldn't be my home. I'm worth at least hundreds of millions. Hundreds of millions? Millions or illusions? Time to get back to work. What work? Why are you taking so long? You can't find a perfect spot? Was I a scrub masseur? What else? Do you prefer cleaning the toilet? Your back is enormous. Where am I supposed to scrub first? First the shoulders, then you do the back. The arms and ribs come next. You used to be good at this. Are you tickling me? Harder. Harder. I said harder. I did that with kung fu! Are you trying to flay me alive? Use some water. Come on. Goodness, you're filthy. Disgusting. It's just dirt, which has many names in different places. In Sichuan and Guizhou, they call it "jiajia." In the northeast, it's called "cun." In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it's "ken." And in Hunan, it's "man." In Guangdong, it's called "laonai," or "nei-nei," which also means teeny-weeny. Hold them tight in your hand. Do I have to? Look how dirty it is! Of course. You have to show them to the customers. Let me tell you, a great scrub job is measured by the amount of dirt. The more you scrub off the skin, the better you are at this job. What are you doing? Finally, I scrubbed your nei-nei off. That was a freaking mole! REFRESH BODY AND REVIVE ENERGY I'm so sorry. Taking a nap? What do you want? Are you frustrated? I've worked for days and I still don't remember a thing. Then you have to work harder. You need to lighten up. Get lost! Is anyone here? Can I take a bath? Nope. What the heck? Wait. Go get changed first. Take a shower, then take a bath. After that, you'll get a good scrub. Great, thanks. Can you imagine how many germs that guy has on him? He should be sterilized first. Now you listen. We don't do that here. I got blisters on my hands, so I can't scrub. You have blisters because you didn't wrap the towel tightly. Your fingers are the tip of the knife and your palm is the blade. I think I've seen this before. See? You're starting to remember. Scrub the dirt bit by bit, so that you can find your memory little by little. Go get ready, go. Come on. BE CAREFUL OF THE SLIPPERY FLOOR MEN'S My brother, you can keep the clothes. I was delivering parcels when I fell into a mud puddle. The customer even gave me a poor rating. You guys are the only ones nice to me. Don't say that. This bathhouse is open to all. Whoever they might be. Everyone's equal when naked. Thank you for your service. Bye. Refresh a man's body as well as his soul. That's what our work is all about. No. It's not dirt I should be scratching. It should be discs. Yes. You did scratch quite a few dishes when you washed them. That was your job. - What the heck? - Zhou. I'm getting your hair tested for DNA. If we are not really related, you're screwed. Do you have any idea how precious hair is to a middle-aged man? Cruel jerk. BATHHOUSE PHYSICAL THERAPY TO REDUCE STRESS Xixi. What? I have school tomorrow. That thing you did last time. The video in which you swapped your face. Could you do that for me? At midnight? Are you nuts? Xixi. Stop bugging me. Fine, just so you know. If you don't help me, your baby brother will be gone in no time. Where is your video? Hurry up. Just send it to me. Come on! What are you waiting for? Something is wrong, Donghai. I am not in any pictures in this house. What are you looking at? Nothing. Let me see. It's nothing really. Give me that! Is that... That is me. No. It was the old you. Why wasn't I looking at the customer? You never liked eye contact. Happy birthday to Xixi. Did I hate our sister or something? Why would I rub cake all over her face? You were always terrible to her. So, hopefully, in the future, you'll keep it that way. No. Something's off. Look, I was in all these videos, but you were not. Are you stupid? I was the one holding the camera. Grandma, step to the right, or you're not in the shot. Grandma, to the right. Hey, grandma walked off again. Grandma. Grandma. Given grandma's situation, why don't you get her a nametag? It's useless. Grandma loses stuff. That's why from now on, you must keep an eye on her. Did I really... No more questions. When you can no longer hold onto something, the only thing you can do is to tell yourself not to forget. Xixi drew those a few years ago. I was... I was going to burn them all. But I still can't remember anything. It doesn't matter. You may not remember me. But... you'll always be my baby brother. Show me the videos again. Don't do that to yourself. Memory is the very source of misery. Let's start all over, shall we? Grandma. I seem to know who I am now. You're my grandson. And I'm your grandma. You better memorize our address. So that one day if you get lost again, people can bring you back. I'll bear it in my mind. When you're finished, I'll take you to a place to have some fun. To where? MUSIC BAR DISCO BALL ♪ Pat yourself on the chest ♪ ♪ And get back on your feet ♪ How many bottles have you had? Slow down, will you? I didn't drink that much. Angela and Baby drank so much more!

Chinese skin care. And I'm the chief skin care officer. Cool, like a CEO. CUO. CUO? The Chinese word for scrub. Get up, my brother. Go get the lady some noodles. With ham sausage, come on. Hurry, go ahead. That kid's never been in a nightclub before. No, no. Come on. It's been forever since we last partied. Here, drink some more. Everyone must drink. Man up, okay? Can't even hold onto a bowl of noodles. Never mind, go get another one. Come on, let's keep drinking. He'll get another one. You listen to me, punk. I've had enough. Maybe I can make peace with the scrubbing and massaging. But using me as a slave to impress women? I'm only doing this to help you remember. Okay? Forget about the noodles. Sit here with us. You take a break, okay? Time to rest. Well, that was embarrassing. I'll do a trick to lighten the mood. - Awesome. - Let's go. What show? That's cool. Quiet down. It gets better. There's more? Don't blink. Seriously? Awesome. Cool. Just my daily routine. Hey, watch where you throw your crap. Get off me. I just had my brows done. Sit. Sir. It's just a bottle cap. No need to get mad. Are those all mine? How should we finish this? I know the rules. I'll drink. How's that, boss? That cost me 4,000. And you drank it in one go? Too late. Go get me another bottle. Please... You must be kidding. That was worth 4,000 yuan? It's a Rémy Martin XO! Do you even know the brand? No, please, this is... Wait. Zhou Donghai. I remember now! What exactly do you remember now? Assaulting people is a crime! This wine is fake. Why do you say so? Listen. There's an anti-forgery pin on every authentic bottle. But yours have none. Also, the bottleneck is supposed to be golden. This is clearly stamped on. Finally, the real thing should say 70 cl. And this one here says 700 ml. Which means, it's worth no more than 40 yuan. - Do you even know what's real? You hick. - Yes! Language, though. Show some respect. Right, hick. Here's another tip. Complain to the Commercial Bureau and you'll get a triple refund. The club will have to pay 12,000 as compensation. - Wait, what? How much? - 12,000 yuan. 12,000 yuan! So, I can actually make some money by drinking here? WE DO NOT SELL FAKE WINE Sir, money has been transferred to your account. We're terribly sorry. It was our fault completely. Wait. I guess we're kind of friends now. I'll boost your business with my friends one day. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you, sir. To who do I owe this honor, if I may ask? Just call us the Rocket Boys. You're totally an idol band. Show them our hearts, come on. There you go. That was not bad. I guess you are not completely useless. I was the one who drank a whole bottle of fake wine. I should at least get 4,000 out of the 12,000. - I took all the risks. - Will you stop being such a loser? - 4,000 is barely worth mentioning. - See? Here we go again. Was I such an ass before? You've been worse. Boss. They are the ones. Well, well, well. Justice League, huh? Show me what you've got. What now? Which one of you started the whole thing? Split and run? Got it. Get them! Stop! Hey, you. Stop. Beat him up. Come back and help me. Go. Now! Go... Now... How can I walk away now? I should run away. You ruthless animal! Run! I dare you to. Hit him! Hit him! Bring it on! It wasn't me. Why are you after me? Can we talk about this? Talk? No talk I guess. Beat the crap out of him. Go, go, go. Now I see it. You're better at running than working. Zhou, you finally acted like a big brother. Please. I've always been a tough guy. I mean, I do remember lots of stuff. The wine, the night club. It felt just like my old life. Your old life? You were a towel boy. You barely had a life. I thought you were lying to me. But you're actually helping me remember. Zhou. I apologize. Listen to me. No need to apologize. We're family. From now on, I'll try not to be a jerk and be a good brother. Great. Just follow my lead. Get business going at the bath. Then we can do whatever we want and buy whatever we want. Hi, I'll have two pancakes. That'll be ten yuan. - How about a discount? - Nope. I'll just have one then. Sure, coming up. With an extra sausage. I'm a sausage guy. - Got it. - Here's six yuan. Zhou. Tell me more about my old life. Well... Let me see. When you were little, you used to hate it when I gave you a bath. You'd be really pissed. But you did like drinking the bath water. Really? You prefer drinking directly from the tub. I did? Sounds familiar, though. See, I told you. You'd get your memory back by staying with me. BATHHOUSE PHYSICAL THERAPY TO REDUCE STRESS No signal. Where did you wind up, you little brat? Done. Next, please. I'm the next person. Where is Zhou? He went to the grocery store. Who are you? I see that business is better than before. When Zhou gets back, give this to him. Here. Look at this crappy little bathhouse. I'm doing you a big favor. Hadn't your brother been begging me all the time, - I wouldn't even bother. - Get lost! - Get out. - Hey, don't push me. Don't show up here again. You will regret this. Xiang, here. Have more meat. More vegetables. Okay, Grandma. Zhou. I found this while cleaning your drawers. Champion. Who said you can go through my stuff? Give me that now. I didn't know you were the champion of a bath skills contest. You must have been a hotshot back in the day. Not really. Remember me? You used to copy my homework. Fatty? You're like a rock star of the communal bath industry. You should be our poster boy. Doesn't matter. It's all pointless. None of this matters. With my skills and your management, we'll take Las Vegas by storm. Running a business is difficult. No one would vouch for me. I would. You can't do that. I'm a public figure now. You see. It's easy for me to get loans. That's not right. Give me the inkpad. There you go, deal sealed. Your skills are the real goldmine. Why would you even stay in this small town? We should go to a big city. I'm just low-key like that. When will you pay for the construction? What do you mean, help you out? You're just a darn masseur, not a master. Pay off your debt. Pay us, pay us! Once a star scrub masseur, now a sentenced debtor. If you have to vouch for others, beware of scams. Why are you so talkative today? Because today, I went to the old street and ordered some decoration materials. We need to redo this place. Where did you get the money? I gave it to him. You gave him your money? But what about the hospital fee? We'll talk about this later. No! Today, a moron named Liu came over. What a jerk. He wanted to buy us out at a low price. Don't worry. I kicked him out immediately. You won't have to see his face again. - How about that? - Well done. Why in the world did you do that? I beg your pardon? You want to sell the bathhouse? And then what? It's my decision. It's up to me. Shame on you! You stupid jerk! Idiot! What? What did you... What did you say? I have no idea. But you should be sorry! Cut it out. - Xiang was only trying to take care of us. - Shut your mouth. Who is in charge here? Do you want to take my place? Eat with us! Bro! Let him be. We can eat by ourselves. Cancer, the 16th typhoon this year, is sweeping across the city. A gale force eight was reported nearby in its wake. Citizens should take measures. Close all doors and windows. Keep away from the danger. I can't hold on any longer. You should get in. If I let go, the roof's gone. Inspector Li, checking this place must be a lot of trouble. Not at all. A seal will do all the job. - It's just a minor water leak. - Right. I can ignore the water leak. But can you explain the air leak? Look at the fancy daylight. With that, we can turn this place into a sunbath pavilion. That's right. We know this is a bold move. - It really is. - Ultraviolet ray can sterilize everything. Customers would like that. Quiet down. Fine. Finish your reconstruction. Next time, I'll shut you down without hesitation. Thank you, Inspector Li. Thank you. That was a close one. I told you to let go last night. You pulled your back. Lie down, I'll give you a massage. Can you massage with one hand? One hand can also give a great massage. So? This move is called Two dragons back to basin. Zhou. You're highly praised by the customers. Not really. I got some nice comments, too. So? Others think highly of you while you make them happy. Isn't this a joyful thing? Then why did you try to sell this place? What choice do I have? How am I supposed to pay for Xixi's art school? Or for grandma's medical expenses? If I don't sell it now, it'll be worth even less. Means you won't have to sell it, if the business is good, right? Donghai. Is it possible to fix this place? Even if we can, what's the point? No one will come here. I'll start cleaning up now. I've got an idea. Don't worry. I'll fix it. Maybe you should start with the headset. After researching for three days, I finally found out what appeals to youngsters. The answer is music! Look, this is my latest blueprint. See? Here will be your favorite Grooving Club, where you can dance. And here will be a place for young people to have pool parties. And our sister can do the graffiti around here. Make full use of her talent. BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE WOOF WOOF, ZHOU DONGHAI BROTHERS TOGETHER CAN CONQUER ANYTHING In its golden age, three guests came to our bathhouse a day. And now, zero. But I need to ask. What is this half human, half catfish thing? It's a mermaid. It's grandma and Xixi. Catfish mermaid. What about this turtle with a dog head? That's you. Catfish and turtle make no family. They are seafood. Even you and me make a family. And you made a bathhouse into a seafood restaurant. You tell me, why did you hang so many paper cups up there? It's called waste recycling. It's a waste for sure. Now, who designed this? Who? I did. Quite creative, I must say. But it's useless. Flashy and useless. What do you know? We just need more advertising. I'll go hand out fliers. What fliers? You'll never get it done. Is the owner here? BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE And you are? It's me. The unlucky delivery guy, who fell into a super dirty muddy pit. Don't you remember me? I'm here to return your clothes. I also brought some friends along to boom your business. I love what you've done with the place. Apparently, no one else thinks so. You just need more advertising. Handing out fliers? We can do that. Most of us are delivery men with parcels and takeouts. Drivers, too. We are out there all the time. Guys, should we do this? - Absolutely. - Of course!

Grandma. You only got two yuan out of a full flush. You should've left while winning. No, always aim for big! Big game. Fine, Grandma. Can you repeat your info to me? My name is Wang Sufen. I'm 75 years old. My home address is is... Grandma, if you can't memorize it, I won't take you out again. Mr. Ma, sir. The buyout is going really well. It's just that, after this bathhouse got popular, the others are having second thoughts now. It must be done before the launch event. You have my word. No problem. Hey, where's my blanket? You can't sleep there anymore. Where am I going to sleep then? I've got a present for you. Time to unveil the mystery. What is this? Come here. So? It's a bunk bed. You'll sleep here from now on. Well, it doesn't look much comfier than the massage table. Definitely not comfier. Just give it a try. Not very comfortable. It sure is different without the steam. Well, you can move back there anytime if you want. Not so comfortable. I might move back in a minute. Really uncomfortable. I don't think I'll sleep here tonight. Donghai. So you bought the bed for Mascot? Yes. The bath pool is damp. It is affecting him. Does this mean we can keep him? That he's not leaving? I'll go make his bed. Donghai. Something's bothering you. What's on your mind? What he owed me... I did the math. It has been paid off now. It's time to let him go. No, no way. I disagree. His appearance makes us become a real family. Why would you send him away? - Donghai! - I'm telling him the truth. Please, think about it. Here, Zhou. Bottoms up. Come on. You see, there's something I need to tell you. The thing is... Dear, this came for you. Thanks, Grandma. It's the DNA test report. - You were saying? - The results came out, huh? What a bastard. Unbelievable. Isn't it pointless to regret it now? - Totally. - Isn't it too late to say sorry? - Sure, you're right. - You're right. But I still owe you guys an apology. Apology accepted. You all have treated me so nicely, and I chose to have a DNA test. I'll be damned! I'll drink this as my punishment. So... you haven't read it yet. I can't do it. Mascot, this is ridiculous. - I'll burn it for you. - Wait! You guys take a look. DNA NOT A MATCH CONFIRMED The truth is unique and absolute. You're absolutely right. I mean, if we were not family, you couldn't have treated me like this. I think you should read it yourself. - Is that really necessary? - Mascot, totally unnecessary. Donghai, should I read it or not? Your call. Should you read it or not? Well, I think... I'm not sure if you should. - You want to find out the truth. Go ahead. - It is pointless. It won't bite. Okay, Grandma. Zhou Donghai. - Now, listen to me... - See, I told you. I did such an unnecessary thing. You see? - There's another piece... - Let me see. It's totally unnecessary. There's no need to read it. That's right. It's burning... - Here. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers, cheers. Yeah, let's drink and forget it. Cheers. No more? I thought you were a big drinker. Drink up. Look at him, Grandma. Just look. Mascot, are you drunk? Donghai, you're lame. Now he's really drunk. It's not hot anymore. No, it's for your feet! Put it down. Put it down now. Come on, drink up. Recently, a viral bathhouse was reported to have conducted severe consumer fraud. The so-called traditional massage is actually done by an untrained cleaner. Its deceiving appearance is hidden within. Have a look at this. Internet sensation, my bum. People from this neighborhood wouldn't even go there. Do you want customers? You don't even have a scrub masseur. Are you kidding me? No, but I do have one. - That guy right there. - Isn't he a cleaner? The revival of tradition is the trend in the market nowadays. However, are they really promoting our cultural legacy or are they just using it as a disguise? It is still to be observed and supervised. I'M SPEECHLESS. IT GAVE ME BAD ENERGY. It's been days without a customer. Looks like our brand is taking a steep dive. What's wrong with you guys? Inspector Li, what brings you here? What did I tell you last time? Inspector Li, there's no need to use a seal. What? Are you telling me how to do my job? I don't have the guts. But you should know that we've been framed. - The other day you were here... - Put away your puppy eyes. Take this. And pull yourself together for lost money and dignity. When my dad was around, he liked it here. You'd better not let him down. Donghai, what's going on? The 26th World Bath Expo? The same expo that crowned you champion? I've got an idea. Why don't we sign up for the contest and win the trophy? Our place will be popular again. And I will compete with my wounded hand? Use my hand. Easy, it hurts! I did win once. What's the point? People still look down on me. Donghai, that's not true. I used to look down on you. That was before. Now I get it. It doesn't matter what we do. What matters is we're together as a family. Together, there is nothing we can't conquer. All I need is your support. Donghai, win the big game! Donghai? All right. If you don't win, you're a wuss. If you don't show up, you're a wuss too! Deal. Training starts tomorrow. This is... where we train? Real heroes are among the common. Hard with the back and easy with the front. Palm for major body parts and fingers for joints. The northern style is all about big moves and evened strength. Palm Print swift cross-over to draw a flower, with finger tips curving and palm folded. The southern style focuses on delicacy. Use your strength meticulously. Checkmate. Come on. Drinking game is on! Stretch your hand to and fro, covering the back densely like laying tiles. Keep wrists tense and palms loose. Scrub, press, and pat to soothe. Hand-made noodles. Wiping the dirt down is trickier than scrubbing it off. Apply weight, just to the point. Such is the art of labor, and the mystery of scrubbing. Boss. This is Ha Jeong-hwan, the international master we hired. He'll win the competition representing the Hot Spring Town. Is he any good? Mr. Jin recommended him. I feel like all this time, you were using me as slave labor instead of training me. I had you scrub the potatoes to train the strength of your fingers. And the corns were for training your palms. What about my paycheck? Paycheck? Listen to me, I was testing your observation skills. - To see if you would notice it. - Well, I did. Right, but this isn't how it works. Put it down. I can't take it anymore. Then don't. Go open the door. Here. Keep it. One for me, one for you. You better not lose it. BROTHERS BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE Xiao... Xiao Xiang. - What? - I've been so worried! Who is Xiao Xiang? Dude, we're not open today. You are Xiao Xiang. No, I'm Zhou Mascot. - It must be a mistake. - Come with me. - Let go. Stop, or I will call for help! - Let's go home. - Who will help you? - Zhou, come here! - What's wrong? - Come here! This guy is trying to mess with us. Looks like we're doomed. Donghai. What's going on? He's not here to mess with us. He's your assistant. I have an assistant? Me? Come here and clean up. We're opening tomorrow. What's happening? Mascot. I mean, Mr. Xiao. You had an accident and lost your memory. The bathhouse happened to be shorthanded, so I tricked you into coming here. No, wait. What are you talking about? Come on Xixi. Tell me. Are you guys trying to prank me? Mascot, I... I... Wait, where did you find this old man to fool me? This must be a prank. - Why are you lying? - Mr. Xiao, it's the truth. Don't interrupt me while I'm talking! BATHINGHAM PALACE See you in a bit. Uncle Wang. You remember, finally. I am Xiao Xiang. Not a scrub masseur. Nor are you my brother. You did trick me. Zhou Mascot. Mascot boy. Uncle Wang, let's go. Mascot is leaving. Donghai, he's going. Mascot! Mascot! Mascot! Mascot! Where are you going? You promised me that you'll take me out if I memorized everything? - I memorized everything now. - Drive. My name is Wang Sufen. I'm 75 years old. My home address is Zhang's Lane... Number eight, Zhang's Lane. I have a grandson named Donghai and another one named Mascot. You promised. You'll take me out if I memorized it. Why are you leaving without your grandma? You promised you'd take me to play. I have a grandson named Mascot and a granddaughter named Xixi. Didn't I... Didn't I memorize all of it? Haven't I done well? It's just the three of us. MR. LIU Uncle Wang, are you having a midnight snack? Got myself some rolled-up pancakes. I never knew pancakes could taste so good. I haven't seen your smile in a while. Like back then... Your father said it so well, "If you want to succeed in something, you need to like it first." I hate being treated like a fool. But I think this guy is honest. BROTHERS - What's the date today? - October 3rd. Tomorrow, you'll attend the expo with Mr. Zhong. I'll pack your stuff. The 26th World Bath Expo officially begins today. All teams were selected by their national tourist authorities. Let's check them out. Check out the Korean-style sauna room and pool. And here is the water-stirring ritual of Japanese hot spring resorts, a procedure to fully mix the herbs in the spring water. If you ever visit Brazil, the host will... Naughty girl! Does it feel good? The Russians like to soak themselves in water with silver birch and a spoon of dry mustard. Hello. Finnish people like patting their bodies using branches soaked in cold water. Thai massages can relax your body thoroughly. What's this? This is a head massage from India. This kind of bubble bath is a specialty of Turkey. It cleanses every pore of your skin. The National Bath Skills Competition aims to motivate workers in the industry to improve their techniques as well as service. The competition will start soon. Mr. Xu, as a health expert, which team would be your choice? Personally, I'm hyped to see the representative of Hot Spring Town, Ha Jeong-hwan. When do we leave? No rush. Let's chill out for a bit. Brothers' Bathhouse is also trending. But their representative has yet to sign up. Do you really want to go? There's a huge crowd. What if grandma gets lost again? She's the one who wants to go. I'm going to see my grandson. I'm right in front of you. Not you, the one who's a scrub masseur. Donghai, are you really selling the bathhouse? Yes. Once we sell it, we'll be well off. Are you leaving or not? Drive on, please. Once we sell the bathhouse, we can move on. Our family will have a new life. We see that the Brothers' Bathhouse has still not shown up. Mr. Xu, do you think it's just a bluff? There has been a scandal after all. I'm leaving now. Why? Just wait to claim the award. - I'm going to compete. - What? We're only here to launch the Hot Spring Town resort. You go ahead, count me out. Are you kidding me? Are you going to compete for that broke loser? Have you no shame? Think straight! You're sabotaging our business. I know, so what? Did you hurt your brain, or did that cheap clinic drive you mad? The clinic. So you knew I was there. You're my brother. I'm your cousin. Take a good look at yourself. If I was your brother, do you think your dad would trust you with the company? Grow up and come to your senses. Give it to him when it's over. Okay. Open the door. Open the door! Open the door and let me out! Why is there no sound? Zhou. Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma. Hi, hello. Look around, take your time. What? Still mad about the fake news? I only did it for your sake. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Sure. Everything is the best arrangement. I'm glad you said that. I have 20,000 more. I made that possible for you. Once you start to sell seafood, don't forget my crab coupons. Open the door, open it! The phone's not working either. I always pack your flying suit with me. That's right, I can fly. It's too dangerous from this height. Please don't do anything stupid. Relax, Uncle Wang. Hurry. Where's Mr. Xiao? Mr. Xiao? Look at what you did. You pushed him too hard, so he jumped out the window. Should anything happen to him, I will push you two out the window with my own hands. Call Mr. Zhong now. Okay. What are you looking at? I cracked my head open. Grandma, is the toolbox heavy? Let me help you. I'm good. I'm good. Ma'am. Ma'am. You can sit here. Okay. Come on. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Mascot! There are 12 teams from all over the world, preparing for our final competition. Every team has its own techniques. We have two groups of judges. One group scores after a physical experience. The other group scores by observing. The 12 teams will perform in turn, and the one with the highest score wins the championship. Crap! Zhou. This thing's broken. How did it break? I'll fix it now. Here. Representing Brothers' Bathhouse is Xiao Xiang, who's registered under the name Mascot Zhou. It might be his stage name. Did you jump out of the hotel building? Seriously? I'm the mascot boy. I won't die. Now, come and sit in this chair and we can still be brothers. We can share everything. Where's the lucky charm I gave you? You can cut the crap, since we're no longer a family. You never really treated me as your brother. Where's your real brother then? Here's the contract. Take a look. Actually, there is no need. Just sign it and get this over with. Mr. Ma. He's signing it. What are you doing? The contract! I'm looking, I am. DONGHAI, BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE Final game. Zhou Mascot, representing the Brothers' Bathhouse versus the legendary Ha Jeong-hwan, representing the Hot Spring Town. Round one! Body cleanse! This part seems easy, but it's the foundation for the entire procedure. The way Ha Jeong-hwan wraps his hand in the towel is very different from that of other Chinese masseurs. Unusual approach. It's actually very sophisticated. Do you think Xiao Xiang will surprise us? More like terrify us. His moves seem very professional. Kids love to show off. But I've got to say, he has been well trained. Ha Jeong-hwan's moves are sharp, but we can't see any dirt. Scrub men on two sides and women on four. Dirtless scrubbing. A real master. Xiao hasn't surprised us yet. That doesn't mean he won't surprise us later. Maybe you just can't see it. So, Mr. Xu, what do you think of Xiao's scrubbing? It's not special at all. Unbelievable. Our experiencer judge must haven't had a shower for a while. Look at the dirt coming off his body! After he signs the contract, tear down this place immediately. Look at this lamp. It's made of paper cups. What garbage. - And this crappy bucket. - So lame. And what is this human-fish thing? Check this out. Catfish and turtles are a family. Even you and me make a family. Let's take a quick look at Xiao. That's incredible. His moves actually put the highly-concentrated judge to sleep! CLEANING SCORE Xiao's score is out. To everyone's surprise, he's got the same score as Ha Jeong-hwan in the first round. Not bad at all. I take back my words. Round two, health improvement. Starts now. It is an extension of a bath, which tests their judgment of the customers' health condition. Mr. Xu, what kind of knife is that? That's the fascia knife, commonly used in foreign massages. Small ones scratch the joints to soothe the veins. Big ones scratch the back to boost circulation. It smells so good. Who ordered takeouts? His essential oil is composed of ginseng, red peony root, and jewelweed. Once heated with hot oil, its scent comforts the customers. You've got this! If you don't win, you're a wuss. If you don't show up, you're a wuss too. Mr. Liu. Stop watching it. What, are you a TV addict or something? Give me the key. I could've signed ten contracts by now. What are you doing? Don't waste my time. You sign the contract while we tear those things down. Come on, guys. Get to work. Do it, now. Wait, not now! You... That's awesome. Not this, please. It ruins the overall visual effect. The paintings are popular. No need to smash everything. You can keep them. - Move. - Tear it down. I won't sell it. I changed my mind. Xiao seems to be distracted. And he's running out of essential oil. Still too young, haste makes waste. Mr. Xu, what is Ha Jeong-hwan doing now? It's a heat therapy like moxibustion. Using a heat source to stimulate the pores. Please do not try this at home. - Mascot! - Mascot... Looks like the crowd is set on fire as well! Xiao seems to have had an incident over there. Mr. Ma, there's no need to get violent. Please! We're still neighbors after all. He could get wounded! You can go home now. I'll take it from here. Yes, sir. Goodness. BATH Well, for the Brothers' Bathhouse, things totally went south. Moreover, Xiao should quit now and go to the hospital. Finally the last round, physical therapy. Back-tapping. For thousands of years, it has been the most ancient legacy in our bath culture, and also the most challenging part. Sign it. Get lost. That was mind-blowing. He seemed to be playing a tune on the back! His rhythm is like war drums, like thousands of horses marching their path. Amazing! What's the color number for his rosy skin? All the capillary vessels are stretching out in full shape. That's the so-called "Thin measles appears to be pink snow, just as the work by the universe." Based on their scores of the first two rounds the Brothers' Bathhouse might be a hot favorite. But now half the time has been wasted, Xiao is not doing well. Looks like the championship goes directly to Ha Jeong-hwan. One hand can also give a great massage. One hand can also give a great massage. He is performing back-tapping with a single hand! That's impossible. Win the big game! "Two dragons back to basin", your classic move. How come I never get it? Listen. There is no classic move for us. Use your hands to interact with customers. Forget about the skills. That is some deep stuff. It's okay if you don't get it now. You will someday. Pivot point. Neck point. Back point. Shoulder point. Side point. Waist point. Are those rashes? Those are acupoints. Brought out by accurate tapping on them during the procedure, so that blood circulation is smoothened through reconciliation of inner energy. One hand can also give a great massage! Mascot. Now it all depends on the judges. Mr. Xu, should Xiao get full marks, he'd defeat Ha Jeong-hwan by one point and win the competition this year! TOTAL SCORE PHYSICAL THERAPY HA JEONG-HWAN VS. ZHOU MASCOT. A judges gave him zero point! We were just informed that Xiao failed for not using the standard gestures. So, I guess, congratulations to Ha Jeong-hwan, our champion this year! Stay down. Don't you move. BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE Brother! BROTHERS' BATHHOUSE Brothers' Bathhouse. Brothers. What are they doing?

Customers from all over the world line up for our ancient oriental bathing style. Grandma still has problems memorizing the address but she has no problem memorizing mahjong tiles. She is now the queen of mahjong in town. Everyone enjoys playing with her. Our sister is extremely talented in arts and knows the art of face-changing. She's now a makeup vlogger. She teaches girls how to deepfake via live stream and has sold millions of products. As for my cousin, I kicked him out since he's not family. From that day on, no one calls me mascot boy anymore. Now they all call me... WASH BATH STEAM SCRUB TAP You sure drew that fast. Does your teacher know? For sweeping. What, you want to fly on it? Me sweep? You're tickling me. I scrubbed your underwear off. See? That is... Grandson, let me do your hair. How about a ponytail? - Let go. - Stop it. A ponytail. What the heck was that? There you go. Who are you? Xixi. Xixi? Then I'll be GiGi. Why didn't you get up? You touched my hand. Then grandma goes like this. - It hasn't started yet. - Happy birthday. Let's start all over, shall we?
