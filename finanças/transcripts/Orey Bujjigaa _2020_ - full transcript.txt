[music] The fastest human on this planet is Usain Bolt. And we have heard recently that some guy ran faster than him in a buffalo race. But there is something which can run faster than both of them. A rumour. Because of a rumour from my village... my life... Well... watch it. [indistinct railway anouncement] [chanting Mantras] Sir, pray to your mother. The time at which your mother has passed away was little inauspicious. Hence, arrange any auspicious ceremony in this house within six months. I'll take leave. What's all this, mom? The air conditioner got damaged due to voltage surge recently. And granny died due to old age. And how can you ruin my life for that, citing ill-omen? What did father say? We are going to financer Swami Naidu's house for matchmaking tomorrow morning. Inform him. I've finished my education in Chennai and came back just recently. So what? Did he meet any Tamil girl there? [scoffs] Our son isn't that kind of guy. I am indeed such a kind of guy, mom! What are you saying? Who is that girl? I'll tell you everything later. First, go and get me all the money from father's wallet. Srujana should accept my proposal before I could tell about her to my parents. I have no option now except slipping away. Are you eloping? Of course. -I thought you were just slipping away. -So stick to that. Son, inform your father as well. I'll update my Whatsapp status saying "I'm eloping." If father asks anything about me, put an innocent face and tell him that you don't know anything. How? Exactly in this manner. [birds chirping] Stop using that phone for a while. They are getting you ready, right? -The groom asked me to call him, granny. -What! -Oh, the groom! -Oh! This generation has sinked so low. But in our days, we used to have our first conversation only during the first night. Son-in-law... How are you doing, Mr Kurapati? -Hey, Raja... -Brother-in-law. -Take him inside. -Come with me, uncle. -Come, have lunch. This way... -Hey... Yeah, tell me. I didn't expect that old man from Kurapati's clan would turn up. It's good that they have come. Where is your sister? -Greetings. Please sit. -Greetings! Keep the bride's tender coconut separately. Otherwise, they might use it to add it to their drinks. Okay, madam. Mother-in-law... -What is it? -Look, the groom is over there. Oh God! If he is sitting here licking his fingers, then, who is it that she is talking over the phone? Hey Krishna... Raja... Krishnaveni is missing. Madam, bring the bride to the wedding platform. -Where are you going, boy? -Oh man! Why did he bump into me? I'm asking you. To Chennai. It's in Tamil Nadu. -Okay! How is everyone at home? -Everyone is doing great! Hey girl! You are Chamundeshwari's daughter, aren't you? Why are both of them going together? Did you hear this, sister-in-law? Koteswar Rao's son is missing. -Is it? -Koteswar Rao's son is missing? We heard that the bride is missing since evening. We heard that both of them have eloped, sister. Is it? [train horn blaring] Yummy! The paste is yummy! Want some? -No, thanks! -Okay. Uncle, is there salt in your paste? There is no salt but there is Dal. Go cook Sambhar with it. -I don't like salt. -Ah! If you stay here, you too will end up as a pervert. -Let's go. -Oh! Aah! Ouch! [grunts] Hey! What are you doing dude? I'm trying to help that lady. Tell me frankly. You have a stupid hope that it'll some workout, right? Yes... Yes... [train horn blaring] -Excuse me? -Huh? -Are you okay? -Yeah, everything's fine. Seems like you are tensed. At these times, you should take a... deep breath. -And exhale slowly. -Oh! Please try it. You can do it. You can do it. I know it. Come on. Please go mind your work. [laughs sarcastically] Men have become disaparage in this society! We searched everywhere including the bus stand and the railway station. -But couldn't find them anywhere. -Blame love... Love! -It can make people do anything. -What the hell are you blabbering? Listen to me, sir. Here, her daughter is missing. And over there, Mr Koteswar Rao's son is missing. Our Chapala Satti saw them boarding a train together. True, sir. I saw them boarding the Chennai train. Raja... Get the vehicle. [clatters] Koteswar Rao! Come out. Where is my daughter? Why are you asking me about your daughter? Where is your son? What do you need to know about my son? Where did he take my daughter? Why will my son take your daughter? My son is at home. Hey Bujjiga... Hey Bujjiga... Bujjiga... Bu... Uhuh! He said he's slipping away for the sake of the girl he loves. But I didn't know, she's your daughter. Come on, guys! Smash everything. -What is all this? -Smash! [chaos] [police siren wailing] He is a rogue, brother-in-law. He has no friends here. -His education was in Chennai. -Wait. Look sir, both of them are majors. It is you who will lose your honour if you keep fighting. Well, do something. Give me their contact numbers. I'll track them and inform you. He might have already discarded his SIM card. He has fled the town like a cunning fox. I would've chopped his arms and limbs in the broad daylight if I had caught him. -As if I'll stay mum while you chop! -What the hell will you do? -We won't let you do that! -Why are you talking in the middle? [overlap of voices] [train horn blaring] [breathing heavily] Not like that... Exhale slowly. Do it once. You're getting some relief now? Why didn't you do it when I told you before? You thought I'm flirting with you? Do you think I'm a flirt? I already have a girlfriend. That's why I am going to Hyderabad to meet her. You won't believe me? Wait. Here... She is beautiful, right? I think you're still not believing me. I will make you talk to her... Wait! I believe you. You don't need to do that. I swear. I swear. Don't do that. Where are you from? -Vizag. -What's your name? SWATI -Swathi. -I'm Srinivas. I am Giri... Sapthagiri. Even I'm with you. Jackass! Since you have reminded me about her, I'll narrate my story. Mine is a beautiful, fantastic, marvellous love story. At the time when I was studying my engineering in Chennai, she was my junior. Her name is Srujana. "Sari Gama Gama Gaama... Let's kick-off a hubbub" "Pada Nisa Nisa Nisa... This moment is all yours..." "Your shadow is like a wonder..." "Your glare must hit like a thunder..." "I can see a thousand watts" "of luminosity of moonlight in your eyes" "I drew your face..." "inside my heart and have been pushing it much deeper" "You are my heartbeat" "You are the inundation of my thoughts" "I keep dreaming about you every moment" "and shared my heart with you" "I thought you're all mine and..." "...walked with you all these days." "I see my entire world" "in you, in this moment" "My life will not stop..." "It has become all yours..." "Your love is my destination..." "Let me come with you like a shadow..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are the inundation of my thoughts" "Sari Gama Gama Gaama... Let's kick-off a hubbub" "Pada Nisa Nisa Nisa... This moment is all yours..." And my love story has started in that way and we've been chatting on Facebook and spend our time at coffee shops... Bro, did it work out or not? -I'll kill you -Oh! It didn't happen? -You... Rascal! -Oh! It means it didn't work out. -Okay... Okay... Okay... -You... Better luck next time. Okay... Okay... Okay... I will sleep. KACHIGUDA [indistinct railway announcement] Bye, Swati. By the way, your love story is simply superb! Turn this side. What's super? It is dumb! -Nothing happened there. -You... What should happen? -Please go. -Nothing. -I'll slap you... -I'll tell her. Hi Krishna... -Hi Sweety... -Krishna... Krishna... What exactly happened? My mom has fixed my wedding with my cousin. Did you pack everything properly? Oh Krishnaveni! Come... Come... -Get those chairs. -Okay, sir. -Coffee? -No. -You want coconut water? -No Go and get one. Cousin, I don't want to get into this wedding. We've grown up together. I never had such feelings on you. -Did you love someone? -Nothing like that. If so, I would've told you. Don't tell your mother that you have talked to me. -I'll take care of everything. -How? I'll tell them that I don't want to get into this wedding. Well... We had discussions and fixed this marriage. But actually, Krishna is very much fond of me. I got to know about it yesterday. She came to the factory to see me. She said she likes me. I'm so happy, Aunt. If he expressed his feelings towards me on that day, I might have got convinced. But that rogue made me wait till the last minute and left me with no option. Fine! Should I tell you the twist that you don't know in this story? There is someone called Bujjigadu in your town. Everyone is thinking that you have eloped with him. What? He slipped away at the same time as you did. Both your phones are switched off at the same time. Scoundrel! Didn't he find any other time to slip away! I can't go back now and tell them that I don't know him. Every moronic guy in this world is disturbing my privacy. It was my cousin over there and here, it is this guy! -What's his name? -Bujji. Hey Bujji... OREY BUJJIGA... (HEY BUJJI...) Hey Bujji... It's been so long that I have seen you! When did you come and what did you get for me from your town? I got four pairs of clothing. Go and wash them. Did you bring four pairs of clothing? I escaped from home for a girl and you are asking me silly questions. Your love story is very interesting. Tell me more about it, Mr Bujji. Hey... Love story? Who is the girl? Mr Bujji... Yes. We are done with the song. Narrate the rest of the story. No, you must listen to the song. Finish the rest of the story and then we shall again listen it from the beginning. Attaboy! I like your excitement. Let's come to the climax. -She's in trying to go to the USA. -Oh! Before she gets her visa, I shall got to her college and propose her. -Super brother! -All the best, sir. All the best. You are Swati, who I met in S3 coach of Visakha Express train, right? Hi, how come you are here? I'm asking you the same question. -I have an appointment with the chairman. -Why? Work-related. -What is that work? -I have an app idea. -I need an investor -Tell me the concept. Hello... Why don't you respond the first time? It'll be a practice for you too. Tell me. Okay. So about 60 to 80 percent of the population... are not able to look at their phones because of their eyesight. But if they download our app, they can set it as per their eye-vision such as nearsighted and farsighted... and see their phones without their glasses on. What if I take your phone? So there are these four steps. We can use them and change the settings. But they should do these four steps with their glasses on, right? -Yeah! -Or they should take help. What if we use a technology that changes the settings automatically as per my eye-vision upon taking your phone? How is that possible? Iris recognition technology... like an iPhone-X lock. If we apply that on our app, Our app will become mandatory for every phone. That will become the USP for our app. Madam, the MD wants to see you. Keep your idea to yourself. Don't confuse me in the last minute. Bye! All the best. Good morning, sir. -Come in. -Yeah. I saw your project idea. I don't think it'll work out. -Sir, but... -Okay! I am farsighted. I'll adjust that in my phone settings and read it. Suppose you are nearsighted. How will you read the content on my phone? Sir, we use those four steps. Four steps... Four steps... I don't think the UI is friendly. But you have a lot of potential. Come back to me with another idea. Okay? [phone rings] Hello. Hello, sir. Yes. Excuse me, sir! Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sounds good. Sir, there is a second prototype for this app as well. Mr Srinu... -I've used your idea. -Did they throw you out? No. It was a super success! They asked me to come again with the detailed project after two weeks. -All the credit goes to you. -Where is the treat? You just heard it once and gave me a superb idea. Will you associate with me? This app will have a nice future. Think about it once, please. It's okay. No problem Shall we start? Mr Srinu, you're a workaholic. Hello... I was telling that I would start my love story. Okay! Please start. Dialer tone: The number you have called is currently busy. [music mutes voice] Hmph! Fantastic! It is very good. Time is running so fast listening to your story. Four missed calls from Srujana baby? -I must leave. It's getting late. Bye. -Okay, bye. The guy who eloped with our madam's daughter is his son. She's is not coming to office because of that pain. I don't think she'd come today. Hey, she is here. Good morning, madam. Mr Koteshwar Rao, madam is calling you. Greetings, madam. What Koti... eshwar Rao? What's the matter? I've handled the construction work of a bridge on the East side canal, madam. I was told they have released the amount in a cheque. So, I came here to collect it. -Sit down. -Thank you, madam. Rangaswamy... Did we receive his cheque? Yes, madam. We received it ten days ago. What is the amount? One crore rupees, madam. Why didn't you hand it over to him till now? You did not sign the cheque, madam. -You were busy with the wedding works. -Oh... Wedding works... Madam Did we check the project? Yes, madam. Why am I not able to recollect it? Maybe I forgot because of wedding works. Let's do something. Let's do the quality check again. Mr Koteshwar Rao... We shall make it go through all kinds of quality check again, make a report and send the file again. What do you think? I'll think that you've been stalling my cheque on the behalf of personal reasons. Yes. Yes, of course. I will not leave this. I will complain this to the higher officials. Complain to whoever the hell you want! I'll even cite that the ink in my pen has been finished. You will get this cheque only when my daughter comes home. Until then... Hmph! I will go to court. I will sit in front of the media. I will make this a big issue. I will drag you on to the roads. [scoffs] Pollution department, forest department, eletricity department etc. I want a NOC from all of them. Rangaswamy, all the departments should meet me and submit NOC to me. Until then, throw this file aside [phone ringing] Hello... How are you, mom? How is father doing? Have you got any sense? Why have you done it in this manner? -Well, mom... my situation... -What situation? Do you know how many problems we are facing? We incurred a loss of one crore rupees. Really? We incurred a loss of one crore rupees when I didn't turn up for the matchmaking that he fixed? Who is giving me so much dowry? Shut up, idiot! Whatever happened has happened. Take good care of the girl. Well, be careful with the gold ornaments. What gold ornaments? Krishnaveni brought so many gold ornaments with her. Who is Krishnaveni? Daughter of Veeramachineni Chamundeshwari. Who is this Veeramachineni? Who is this Chamundeshwari? Why are you joking? You've eloped with Krishnaveni, daughter of Chamundeshwari, haven't you? -Who told you this? -It was you who has told me that. Me? You said that you were going to the girl who you loved. Yeah. Krishnaveni's too slipped away from her home at the same. So... So... So, I thought that she came with you and told the same to everyone. Are you insane? How can you say that, mom? You've written the review of a movie by watching the trailer. Oh no! It is my fault! I blame myself for everything that has happened. Wait, I'll go and inform everything to your father. Stop it! Retraction of a gossip won't change people's mind after it becomes viral. First, tell me about the situation there. Since Chamundeshwari believes that you've eloped with her daughter, she has put your father's cheque of one crore rupees on hold. She added our company's name in the black list. I don't understand what should we do now. First, stop crying! I don't know who is Veeramachineni or Chamundeshwari or Krishnaveni. But if I get her to our town and hand her to her family, father's problem would be solved. All I know is this. I'll be on that. Please do that, son. If you want any money, take it from aunt Beba. I'll call and inform her. I know what to do. Hang up! Name of the girl? Krishnaveni -Last name? -Veeramachineni Whoa! What a rhyming! Oh... Lots of profiles, bro. There is only one school in our town. Everyone has to study until seventh grade in that school. You are right! Chances are bright! -Hold it, dude. -Oh, sorry! What's the name of the school? Vignana Jyothi Memorial High School. Hey... What is that she has put up a flower as her profile picture? That's the nature of the girls. They keep flowers and birds as their profile pictures. See if there are any other pictures. No access. I think she is astute! Mr Bujji, what should we do now? What if we... create a fake female profile and send her friend request? Good idea! Let's do it. What name shall we use? ANDHRA JYOTHI Jyothi. Request sent. -Let's go! -Wait, Mr Bujji. Let's wait for her reply. Girls are very astute! Upon sending a friend request, they would immediately see it. But they'd take two days to accept the request. Let's check it tomorrow. Close it. Sorry, baby. Ignoring your call is like... I just can't... You look so cute when you request me innocently. You don't get even a bit angry at me, do you? -Let's talk something interesting -Yeah Actually, why I came to Hyderabad is that... Huh! One second. The food which you've ordered last night through Swiggy was very delicious! That's not a big deal. I'll send you one more tomorrow. It'll be amazing! Hi, Mr Srinu... She is Swathi. -And she is... -Srujana. How do you know my name? Mr Srinu keeps talking about you all the time. -What did he say? -Please don't tell her anything. No, this is the right time. Tell her. This is not the right time. I'll express my love to her later. -Hello. -You mustn't delay such things. Tell her. Hello... May I know what's happening here? Nothing, baby. -What will you have? -Ice cream. -Vanilla ice cream? -Yeah. With almonds, tutti frutti, chocolate syrup? You know me, right baby? -What about you? -Dark chocolate. Hello bearer, take the order. [sighs] I'll go and get it. I think he's in love with you. -Really? -Hmm. And your pair looks beautiful. Oh no! There's nothing like that. I've applied for a visa to go to the US. Once I get it, I'll be there, and he'll be here. And that doesn't work out. What if you don't get a visa? It is not an issue if I don't get it Rajesh has a Green Card. He has already proposed, so I'll accept his proposal. So, you won't accept his love regardless of getting a visa or not. Yeah Why don't you tell him that? How can you talk so being a girl? Who is a boyfriend? He is our Flipkart, Swiggy, Ola, BookMyShow and a credit card. He's a confused character who'll create a beautiful environment between parents and husband. How can we let go of such a person? Will you just use him and discard? What's wrong in it? Yeah! What's wrong in it? Mr Srinu, what do you know? I need not know anything. My baby is always right. -What, baby? -Yeah. Umm... I'm getting late for my class. I'm going. Okay? Bye. Actually, the reason why I came to Hyderabad is that... Do you have to tell it out to me? Do you think that I don't understand what's in your heart? Next time, we shall meet privately without her. Personally... Okay? Bye. Mr Srinu. Your baby is a bit commercial. It might not work out for you. What do you know? My baby is as sacred as fire. Fire! Not paying the bill doesn't make her commercial. Look, she left her ice-cream for me realising my hunger. That is mine. Your baby swept everything. She might be very hungry. When will you understand, fool? They're playing around [message notification tone] Hey Srinu! Your Krishnaveni Veeramachineni has sent a reply. Come here. See... Hi, this is Jyothi. [message notification tone] Jyothi, who? [message notification tone] -You've flattered her. -Wow! Jyothi from Kukatpally. I was going through your profile. Looks pretty interesting. That's why I've sent you a request. [message notification tone] Send me your pic. [message notification tone] What are you thinking, Mr Bujji? Send her the photo of the gril you met on the train. What happened? Oh, a flower as her profile picture in here as well? Hey... Do something. Send her a photo of an 18-year-old hot-sizzling girl. -Hot-sizzling girl... -Hmm... Hey... What is this? You have asked for hot-sizzling girl, right? Put some clothes to the hot-sizzling girl and send the photo to her. If we want her to fall in our trap, our plan must be proper. A hot-sizzling girl with clothing... Who is there? Well... Send a photo of your girlfriend. No, I won't the photo of my girlfriend. -Hey, send it. -Ah! How, dude? I don't know, dude. It just happened. Oh my God! [message notification tone] Take today's newspaper, hold it and click a photo such that the date is visible. And send that photo. [message notification tone] She is not just astute. Outrageously insightful! Do something. Call your girlfriend. Ask her to click a photo holding today's newspaper and send it to you. Well... There is a small technical problem in this. So that's not possible. -Technical problem? -Yeah. What is it? I had a quarrel with my girlfriend four days ago. We are not in talking terms now. So she will not send her photo. Call her number, I will speak with her. Not possible, dude. I've deleted her phone number after that fight. So, I am sorry. Don't mind. Tell the truth. Well, the photo that I've sent is not my girlfriend's. As I don't want to involve my girlfriend in your family brawl, I've sent a random photo from Google. You've ruined everything! I doubted you when I saw the photo. Rascal! She's asking for a photo. What shall we do now? How about we edit the photo using 'Photoshop'? You... No... No... No... Since I have brought this problem, I will handle this case. -Please, give me one chance. -Do whatever you want. Damn! I did not buy today's newspaper. I will buy it tomorrow and send my picture with it. [message notification tone] Who the freaking fake account guy are you? Idiot! Without any doubt... Yes! I'm Bujji... I won't leave you. I won't... Hey, what is this? She is scolding us. Now, she knows that the profile belongs to me. You've ruined everything! Bloody moron! Hey Bujji, you will never get a girlfriend. Even if you get one, she'll use you and dump. This is my curse. Will any guy talk to her gently? Forget about manners. Move... -So, you got the visa? -Yes. Congratulations! Thank you! I will keep in touch with you after going to the USA. America is not so far. It is just a psychological distance. Even if I get engaged to someone else, I'll keep talking to you. You gave me that facility as well? -Yeah -What else? There is a 'Swagruha Foods' store in your colony. They make delicious pickles. Keep sending them regularly. You can send me anything you want. I will take it without any hesitation. -Is it? -Hmm. One minute. We are talking about some personal things. We'd be having some cute and sweet conversations, right? I have already heard everything. -You heard everything? -Almost everything. It's alright if you have heard us. But there are still some things we didn't discuss yet. So, maintain some distance, please. Tell me, bloody chimpanzee faced girl! What? What, my foot! You didn't even properly show anything, yet you've totally exploited me. What have I shown and exploited you, baby? My foot, baby! My freaking life, baby! Are you stupid, what are you talking? Stupid, my foot! I'll smash your face with my footwear. -Vixen. -Go to hell! That is far better than being with you. What did your baby say? [DJ music in the background] I'll go back to my hometown tomorrow. How will you go? You've eloped with Krishnaveni Veeramachineni, along with her jewellery. How can you go back without her? Mr Bujji, your Krishnaveni is very powerful. She just cursed you and Srujana dumped you. -Give me soda. -Damn her! Damn! It feels like I'm buying duty free misfortune just by chatting with her. It's okay. It's okay. -Pass the chips. -Buddy... I've had some feelings for Srujana, right? Hmm. That is the reason I slipped away from my home and came here for her, right? Then, why am I not feeling any pain when broke up with me? I've been only mad about getting dumped in front of Swati and stood like a fool before her. But I don't feel any pain of the love failure. Does it mean that my feelings are dead? -Have I turned into a stone? -Hey... Hey... You want the feeling of pain of love failure, right? Prepare a double strong peg. Enough... Drink it. Close your eyes, gulp it and think about Srujana from the bottom of your heart. And then you'll ooze the feeling of love failure from your heart, eyes, nerves and blood Come on, do it. Whoa! I closed my eyes, gulped the drink and thought about Srujana from the bottom of my heart. But... Puff! -Why am I seeing Swati instead of Srujana? -Hey... -Mr Bujji... -What are you talking? I don't understand anything. Hey... Try it one more time. Please, pour some. Congratulations dude! You've proved you're an engineering student. -Congratulations! [phone ringing] -Dude.. Swathi is calling. Hello -Hello... -Mr Srinu. Hi. Hi, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. -I just wanted to ask you If someone close to us is in pain, we can't take it. Are you sure, you're okay? Yeah, I'm totally okay. Thank you! Bye.

Mr Swamy Naidu, don't ruin our honour and humiliate us. Koteshwar Rao, don't talk too much. Your son has already ruined your honour long ago. What else is left for me to ruin it further? Hello, aunt. Please don't mind but I cannot give you money this time. Why do you say that? His mother has been promptly repaying your amount every month, right? She hasn't been repaying. I heard that they were in financial crisis. My husband told that they have become bankrupt and have kept all their properties for sale. Don't take it in the wrong way. Please leave. We should do something! Her mother... Her mother... We should do something about her mother. Babu bro... -What? -Shall I upload it on Youtube? Show it to me. To grow beautiful hair... Umm... Damn! What's that title? It is very repulsive. That title won't attract viewers. Do something. Put the title as 'Do anyone has it so long?' It'll earn one lakh clicks in a day. Brother, the subject is about the hair, right? And what I've been talking is also about the hair. The viewers wouldn't know that until they watch. [phone ringing] Hey Bobby, I want you to do something for me. -Finish it quickly. -Greetings, madam. -Greetings. -I need to talk to you personally. -Tell me -It's a bit personal, madam. Oh! -Rangaswamy, please wait outside. -Okay, madam. Only for five minutes. -Tell me the matter clearly. -Nothing, madam. I got a contract of CC road. You might be knowing it. -So? -It's a huge contract It costs a huge amount for cement, stone, sand and iron. On top of the, there's been inflated prices outside. You should help me with this. Ensure small deviations in technical specifications. That's it, madam. I'll give you your share. How much can you pay? [stammers] I can give you upto 25 lakh rupees. You said it is a big contract -but twenty five lakhs is way too less. -Madam. I cannot afford more than that. There are many others who I should pay. Fix on 25 lakh rupees. Okay. -Did you get any amount now? -Yes, madam. Here is the amount of two lakh lakhs rupees as advance. Bro, what happened? Did she take the amount? [talking gibberish] Did she take the amount? What are you thinking about me? -Did you come here knowing about me? -I thought I know everything, madam. -Will you dare to come around here? -No! -What will you do now? -Jump! -Wait! -Take this amount. Thanks, madam. Wait. Don't put it in your pocket. Put it in that box. Madam, what nonsense? Are you serious? -Two lakh rupees for foundation? -Shut up! Put the amount! You are a heartless, madam! Leave. I didn't expect honest officers in the government office, bro. -This will not work out, bro. -Ok, leave it. Hey, what about my two lakh rupees? I'll send them through Paytm. Hang up. It didn't work out from that side as well. Things are not moving despite spending 24 hours on Facebook. And Babu's idea too didn't work out.

Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, SR Nagar, Madhapur, Ameerpet... -She must be in this 10 kilometres radius. -Yeah, exactly! -Ouch! -Hey, what happened? I'm fine. Seems like you've been into heavy shopping. We would've gone to Madhapur together in the same cab if you had told me before. -There is a 50% sale too. -Hey... How do you know that I went to Madhapur? I didn't inform you, right? You tagged your location on Facebook, right? Then, would my family know that I'm in Hyderabad? And Bujji as well? -How's my dress? -Move. I should first delete that location tag. My new dress... I got this in offer. I will not get another one like this. See how it got wrinkled. Hey, she has deleted the location tag. Why are you behaving like a Big Boss contestant? Do you think Bujji saw that tag? Why don't you unfriend and block him when you're so scared? Since this is the only way for Bujji to contact us, he's been not finding an alternative. We don't know how he is going to contact us other than this method. I'm getting tensed because of him. If I take stress, I'll get pimples. Did I get any? Look. Hmm... I should be very careful from now. Damn! We've been unable to catch Krishnaveni despite knowing that she's is here in Hyderabad. This is very terrible. How can we search for her without even knowing how she looks? Cheers! [phone rings] Hello! [laughs hysterically] When are you inviting us for your wedding feast? -Satya? -Yes. Who gave you my phone number? I swear, I won't share Bujji's phone number with anyone. Ouch! Raju is also here. He wants to talk to you. -Here. -Give me. Congratulations, buddy! We heard that it is Chamundeshwari's daughter Krishnaveni. Super figure, dude! Lower the volume of your voices. It is as if you are speaking to me directly. Give the phone to Satya. -Tell me -Don't share my number with anyone. Where did you go all these days? -That is... -Alright. -Krishnaveni... -She is Chamundeshwari's daughter. Yeah! Send her photo to me. Why do you ask for her photo when she is right beside you? Click a selfie. It is the latest fashion. Don't irritate me and do what I say. Passport size photo will also do. You need Krishnaveni's passport, right? -Yeah -I will take care. Hang up. -Careful, dude. -Just hang up. What will she do with so much money? Just pay her fifty rupees. Here. You have understood what we told you, right? Stay here, sir. I will get it within the time of a snap. [snaps] Where is it? Go and get it. Bloody TV influence! Does she know what a passport is? I doubt she might get a ration card or some other card. [scoffs] I told her very clearly. I'm confident that she'd bring it. -Clearly? -Look, she's coming. Wow! She is such a trustworthy maid! There must be one like her in every home. Very trustworthy maid! You should have given her fifty rupees more. -Get to your work. -One minute. -Good luck! -Hey... Tsk! How long will you stare at us? Quickly bash us. Take the rest of the money and bash them. [groans in pain] They hit me on the wrong place. -Stop it. Get up. -Please... Tell me now, why do you need her passport? Which girl, sir? Bujji asked us to do so, sir. It means you have Bujji's number. -No, sir. -Yes, sir. [groans in pain] I'm breaking the promise. Then, call Bujji. [music mutes voice] -Sir, he'll explain that to you. -Okay. Actually, it's very simple sir. [phone ringing] -Anything important? -Excuse me! ISD call. Very important. I'll be right back. -Did you find it? -What is that? -We got them. -Who is it? I'm Krishnaveni's uncle. -Uncle... Actually what happened was... -Hey! -Don't connect any relations. -What relation? -I asked him to get her photo. -Not photo, you wanted her passport. Passport? What will I do with that? That is the reason you have called them, right? -Give the phone to that idiots. -Not me. He is the idiot. The phone is on speaker mode. You can talk to any idiot. What did I ask you? Bujji, you're doing this because we got caught, right? You asked for her passport, right? Didn't you plan a foreign tour with Krishnaveni? Hey... What are you talking? I think he's busy Why don't we do this another day? Sir... No! -He'll be right back in five minutes. -No, it's ok We'll just set it up... Maybe tomorrow? In my office. -Sir, I'm so sorry about this -Not a problem at all. -See you tomorrow. -Thank you, sir. Please listen to me once. -Hey! -One second. Is there a problem? Life and death problem. ISD call. Okay. The investor has left. He'll let us know about the next meeting after two days. Okay. -I have some work. I'll leave. -Okay! Thank you Hello. I'm also trying here to find Krishnaveni. -Aren't you trying? -What do you mean? We are searching for her in every lane in Chennai. Why are you searching in Chennai when I and your daughter are in Hyderabad? -You are in Hyderabad? -Yeah I and your daughter are in Hyderabad. If you want to do anything, do it here. -You gave me very good information. -Information? What is it? You said that Krishnaveni is with you. I didn't mean that. Hello... Hello... Who the hell is this crazy fellow linking everything without any sense? [phone ringing] What is this? I'm getting a real ISD call. Srinu... -Srujana. -Sorry, baby. Sorry? Whom did you trap? Oh you understood! It's Sundar Pillai. You have finally settled for a Kerala guy. -But I should thank you -That means, you too... -Yes -Who is she? I have introduced her to you. Swathi... Oh, she is really a good girl! That's why she got found a good guy and that's me. Boo! -Why did you call? -Sundar Pillai thanked you. -Why? -He came to my room for lunch. Okay. He ate those Swagruha pickles which you have sent. He asked me to tell you that they were very tasty. It's okay. -You called me to tell this? -No! They are finished. My friend is coming here from Hyderabad tomorrow. Will you send them? Of course, I should buy them and send them. Boyfriend is like a Lux soap when you are in a relationship. You'd use him to rub all over your body. After a breakup, you use him like a Dettol soap, only to wash your hands. -So cute baby! -What is cute in this? -Everything is backstabbing, right? -You'll send them, right? As if I would deny you. Send me your friend's phone number. Oh so cute baby! -Sweety! Cutie! Naughty, Bujji! -Go, tell all these nonsense to Pillai. Hang up. Hmph! -Coffee. -Thank you. Listen to me. Everyone at home would be worrying about you. Your mom might be very pained. -When will you go home? -I'll go soon. Just a few more days. [doorbell dings] Alright! As if you have ever listened to me! Who do you want? I am looking for Srujana's friend to give the US parcel. Come on in, son. Swetha told me that you'd come. -Swetha... -Yes, mom. Srujana's friend is here to meet you. Come here. Swetha, he is Srujana's friend. Attend him. Hey! Hi, I'm Swetha. Who are you? Srinu He is Mr Srinu. Do you already know each other? Pretty much. He is a good natured guy with a big heart. He has an immense helping nature. -I'll leave. -Come on. Have some tea and go. -It's okay. -Come Mr Srinu. Have some tea Come, sit down. Mom! Have 3-Roses tea which has good colour, taste and density and then, leave. Sit down, Mr Srinu. -Actually... -Sit comfortably. -What happened... -Have tea. I'm getting late. I'll leave. I'll leave as well. -Aunt, I'm leaving. -Take the Kalakand sweet box over there. -Okay. -Can I come along? No, I'll go. [motorcycle revvs] Is this your ISD call? No! That was a totally different phone call than this. -Actually, I got two calls. -Do you have any sense? An investor has come to us. You, me and all our friends can get settled with this project. But you've ignored this and were supplying pickles to the girl who dumped you. What should I think about it? Is it just pickles or pumpkin snacks from Begum Bazaar and bangles from Old City as well? Look, you are angry. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Wait. Where are you going? Since you have mentioned pumpkin snacks, I just remembered that she is very fond of those. Kalakand sweet and it is homemade. It is yummy! [message notification tone] [message notification tone] [phone rings] Hello. I am sorry. You told me this on Whatsapp. I got two ISD calls instantly. What can I do about that? -Please try to understand -Yeah, I believe you. But I was the only one who got angered. It is Srujana's bad luck that she missed you. But, why are you sending pickles to a girl who dumped you? Damn! She said she's not able to eat anything in America and might die out of hunger. So I said I'll send her these pickles as a charity so that she'd survive. It feels so soothing listening to your smile. I'm getting another phone call. Please be on the line. Okay. Go downstairs immediately. Sai will come and pick you. What? Why? All that is a surprise. Please come fast. Video call? Didn't I tell tell that this is a surprise? Close your eyes. Do not open them till I tell you. Okay. -Can I open my eyes now? -No. Come forward for about ten feet from there. Okay. Now turn 30 degrees to your left. Okay Just 30 degrees. -Okay. -Walk straight. Stop! Turn the camera to your right. Walk a bit forward. Stop. Now, open your eyes Surprise! What's the surprise here? You've saved the turtle eggs on the other day, right? They would hatch after 56 days. Yeah. These are the babies which you saved. The people from the Blue Cross organisation called me suddenly. I had no time to pick you up. -So... -Oh my god! They are going in the opposite direction Srinu... Do something, Srinu. Quick. Oh no! Thank you, Srinu! "Will there be a shower of romantic rain in our hearts?" "Will our eyes ever come together?" "Will those stars in the sky come to us" "at the time when the body is floating like a cloud?" "My heart wants you with it..." "I started liking you with each passing day" "My heart wants you with it..." "I started liking you with each passing day" "Will there be a shower of romantic rain in our hearts?" "Will our eyes ever come together?" "It is a boon that made me go back to my childhood days" "My heart wanted to know what I found in you" "It wanted me to be with you" "My world has started revolving around you" "Our heartbeats have become one now" "My heart wants you with it..." "I started liking you with each passing day" "Will there be a shower of romantic rain in our hearts?" "Will our eyes ever come together?" [phone rings] Bujji, I'm Krishnaveni's uncle. Listen to me once. I did not elope with your girl. If that is true, go and meet my men who came to the city. Where are they? I didn't really elope with your girl, bro What I'm saying is that... Boss, Bujji has just arrived. I'll call you later. Well... Um? -Did you eat anything? -No. -Do you want to have anything? -No. Come on, bro. After all, we hail from the same town. Waiter... [no audio] Boss, Bujji really seems like a good natured guy. Hello... Phew! Let's get to our actual topic now. What I'm saying is... [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello Srinu, where are you? -Begum Bazaar -Begum Bazaar? For pumpkin snacks? No... No... You got it wrong! Due to heavy traffic in Koti, I took a right and then drove to my left. And I landed up in Begum Bazaar. That's it. Okay. We have a meeting at 10 am. You didn't forget it, right? I'm on my way. Where are you? -Sundarayya Bhavan -I'll be at Sundarayya Bhavan in 2 minutes -Hey Bujji... -Hey Bujji... [phone rings] Boss, Bujji is a worst fellow! He ordered food and ran away. Please transfer 10,000 rupees through Paytm, bro. 10,000 rupees? What is the quantity that you ate? The food was so delicious... Glutton idiots! Well, where is he? He went to Sundarayya Bhavan to meet some girl. A girl near Sundarayya Bhavan? Yes, boss. He told her that he would reach there in two minutes. Appalnaidu stays nearby, doesn't he? [camera clicks] Beautiful, right? I'll use this as my Whatsapp display picture. I'll send it to you. The photo is really beautiful. Okay, send it to me. -Let's go! -Hey, who are you? -Just come... -Who are you? Let go of me! -Move! -Let go of me. Who are you? Leave me. [groans in pain] [groans in pain] [groans in pain] [camera clicks] Who is he? He clicked my photo as if I am a celebrity. What's the issue? -That's... -Actually, that problem is mine. -What's the problem? -It is personal. What personal? That is the issue of my hometown. -What issue? -I will not tell you. It's not your problem. It's about her. You don't want to tell us. Don't tell us. But what if something happened to her? Alright. We have a meeting to attend. Shall we go? I have a headache. You attend it. Okay. -Why did you lie to him? -What should I say then? We don't know whether those men were sent by Bujji or your family. When you tell this problem to Srinu, you should narrate everything including Bujji's incident as well. It doesn't matter who I tell this but I should tell this to Srinu. I already feel very guilty for travelling with him with the wrong name. Alright, tell him. We caught your girl. But he came, fought with us and rescued her. Bujji seems to be a trickster. He told us that he didn't elope with her but he has rescued her. Hey, call him. [phone ringing] Carry on No, sir... No phones at all. [music mutes voice] Excellent! I'm impressed. Really... really impressed! Look, it's a deal. -Let's work on this together. -Thank you, sir Give me a couple of days and we'll meet again. -Sure, sir -Alright? See you. How can there be 36 missed calls, bro? Isn't this too much? Bujji... We are waiting here. Can't we meet anywhere except Begum Bazar? -Why? -Vastu isn't good at that place. Meetings in that place are not yielding good results. Then, you suggest us where shall we meet. I don't know anything, bro. Trust me. Why will I come back if I have really eloped with your master's daughter? The matter is... -Did you eat anything? -No... We don't want to eat. Come on, bro. We hail from the same town. But still, it is a no. They won't let us sit here if we don't order anything. Hello, get a water bottle. -One bottle for all of you? -Yes Only one water bottle. Srinu... Thank you for saving me. I can't imagine what would've happened if you were not there in the morning. I was never so afraid in all my life. I should tell you the truth. My name is Krishnaveni, not Swathi. As we came out on the same day, there were many rumours in the hometown and you have misunderstood it. Why will I come and meet you here if I have really eloped with her? [message notification tone] One minute... Srinu... Thank you for saving me. I can't imagine what would've happened if you didn't come in the morning. I was never so afraid in all my life. I should... Why the hell are you listening to songs in the middle of serious discussion? Okay! What do you want now? -We need our master's daughter. -Show me her photo. You didn't see her till now? Why is he fooling around? Okay. Hey, show him the photo. [mobile phone clatters] [sighs] You could have simply passed the phone. To hell with your throw! The display is wrecked. Show the photo on another phone. -No, there is no other photo. -Give me your phone. -What about your mail? -Give it to me. What's a mail? Isn't it foolish to go searching for her by having just two photos in the phone? -What about your act, isn't it foolish? -What did I do? I too have the necessity to nab your master's daughter. My family is suffering because of her. I've been putting maximum efforts. Do you want to see the chat exchange between me and your master's daughter? Look. [exchange of cursing texts] If I type 'vixen' and send it to her, she'll immediately reply. I'll show you. Rogue! See for yourself. [message notification tone] [exchange of cursing texts] -Text her 'I love you.' -What? Just text her. He's not getting my point. Are you out of your mind? You buffalo! Shameless idiot! [message notification tone] [exchange of cursing texts] These texts indicate that you are telling the truth. But why did you rescue her by fighting with my men in the morning? -Me? Where? -Sundarayya Bhavan Actually, that problem is mine. -Sweety? -Not Sweety, Krishnaveni. Sweety... Krishnaveni [phone ringing] Did you listen to it? Yes, I listened to it completely and got to know a lot of new things. Well, what is Sweety doing? She's busy surfing on Facebook. It is my birthday tomorrow. Why is that all of a sudden? Birthdays don't come suddenly. It comes once a year. And my birthday happens to be tomorrow. So, get your friends and I'll get my friends. I don't have any friends. I just have Sweety. Enough! She is enough. You don't need anyone else. Come along with her to Deccan Park at 11 am. Okay. That's it. Firstly, I need to talk to your madam Chamundeshwari. I'll agree with all your points if you do as per your words. -Mom... -Is everything alright? You aren't facing any trouble, are you? Nothing at all. Pass the phone to father. They have withdrawn the case. They said that they will give us the cheque if we handover their daughter. You'll get the cheque at sharp 11 am. -Call me as soon as you receive it. -Okay, son. Okay, father. Let's go. Bro, I have a doubt Didn't you say that your girlfriend is a friend of my master's daughter? Wouldn't your girlfriend feel bad if you handover her friend? You are right! How did I miss this simple logic? To hell with your stupid doubts! -Why the hell are you meddling? -Let's go Sir... He was right. Love you, dude. Mwah! There is a small change in our 'operation 11 o'clock.' Take away Krishnaveni with you at 11 am as planned. I will enter the scene at 11.30 as if I don't know anything. Okay. She is at Deccan park. A voice message of 10 minutes? Srinu, thank you for saving me I can't imagine what would've happened if you didn't come in the morning. I was never so afraid in all my life. I should tell you the truth My name is Krishnaveni, not Swathi. I am sorry. My hometown is Nidadavolu. I ran away from my home because I didn't want that marriage to happen. At the same time, Bujji, who stays in my hometown, left his home as well. The entire town has been thinking that both of us have eloped. I am in a situation where I can't go home and tell them the truth. [phone ringing] -Hello. -Sister. Bujji helped us in finding our girl as he said. Handover the cheque to his father. Okay. Shall we go? [phone ringing] Son, they gave us the cheque. We heard that you have handed over their girl to them. I'll call you back, father. Okay dear, as you wish. You... Chamundeshwari... Get her married and all this nonsense will end. [weeping] [train horn blaring] My son has arrived! Start the percussions! [procession percussions] Look, how he is celebrating. Wait... Wait! Son, twirl your moustache as a sign of pride. Father, this is not the situation to twirl moustache. Forget it. You have a moustache, twirl it. Tiger! May the evil-eye from the city, village and neighbourhood be warded off. Start the percussions! My darling son! Come on in. [firecrackers bursting] Bullabbai, what is all that noise? Since Bujji has got you caught. Their family is celebrating! [firecrackers bursting] -What, dear? -Do you have alcohol? Are you ill? I am feeling very low. I don't have good brands of alcohol, dear. Pain doesn't see brands. Oh! Don't gulp it. It would affect your liver. My life has no meaning. So, who cares about the liver? More... Don't drink it undiluted, dear. I'll add a little water. Are you feeling bad that I am boozing? Nothing like that, dear. -This is just your second peg. Have it. -Okay. Daddy What is your opinion on Bujji? He is a golden boy, dear. -Ah! What? -He is a rascal! He is the epitome of worthlessness. Yeah. Daddy, did I scold you in this flow? No, dear. Okay. I just remembered something. Hitmen and thugs who'd break someone's arms and legs upon getting paid... Yeah Do we have their numbers in our phone book, daddy? Yeah, dear. But why? It is alright if we spent 10 lakh rupees... Just call them, daddy. We should get Bujji killed. Call them. Why now, dear? Let's do it tomorrow. Daddy, who'd inherit all this property? Of course you, dear. Then, what are you thinking? Nothing like that, dear. Bujji has ruined my life, daddy! He just uprooted my life, which is like a plant and fed it to the goat. Just like they sacrifice a goat at the tribal temple... this guy should be sacrificed ruthlessly. What's with your language, dear? My language and body language become crooked when I talk about him. Daddy, don't call anybody. It is you who should kill him. -Let's go. We'll kill him. -Dear... Dear... -Dear, do you think it's that easy? -Let's go. We'll kill him. -What happened son-in-law? -He must die today Oh no! Son-in-law... She got to know it! -Son-in-law... -Mother-in-law... -You are boozing along with your daughter. -[sarcastically imitating] Oh God! How can you booze along with my granddaughter? It is your granddaughter who is boozing along with your son-in-law. Sit down. Sit. Do you want to have a peg? What? Your word is my word? What is this? Why're you fixing my wedding without my consent as if you don't have any other work? If you would have told us your opinion, we wouldn't have fixed it. What should I say? Well... I have informed this rogue! Rogue? I have informed you as well. And that woman... my mother... doesn't she know my feelings? Attending office with big glasses is not what she should do! Oh God! Daddy, I have a small idea. -Tell me. -Grandma, bless me. The wedding will not happen if we kill this old hag, right? Excellent idea, dear! Your wedding certainly won't happen until a year. Really dad? Sure? Yeah. Certainly. On top of that, we can bury her inside the house. -It is safe -Then, just kill her. Son-in-law... Son-in-law... -Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law... -Daddy... -you cannot do this. I will kill her. -Oh no! Wait, you old hag. Stop, you old hag. -Careful -Daddy, out of the way. -Is she going to kill me or what? -Stop, you old hag. I will kill you. What is all this, son-in-law? -Why did you come in between? -As I didn't have any sense. Don't tell all this to my daughter. You too don't tell her about the things here. I will not tell her. My ill-fate! She has created a big mess! She proved that she is her daughter. I need to have a smoke immediately I'm getting crushed between this mother and daughter. Why are you still doubtful when you are seeing two shadows? Oh! [sighs] You? I came here to apologise to Krishnaveni. Why did you jump over the gate? It is unlocked. I didn't see it, uncle. -What about doorbell? -I didn't get that idea, uncle. You came here to apologise to her at this time? Well, I've been worried that she might feel bad for getting her caught. I hope she isn't feeling bad, right uncle? No... Nothing like that. She just wants to kill you. That's it. Don't hang around this surroundings for some days. She wants to hire thugs to get your body parts chopped. That's not the case, uncle. Well... It is not safe for you to stay here for a longer period. I am advising you as you a fellow man, come with me. I'll drop you. -I'll go by myself, uncle. -Come with me, I'll drop you. To hell with these contractors! Wait, I'm coming. Hold on. How come you are dropping him? I saw your son jumping over my gate. -Oh no! -So, I came here to drop him. Will you not let us live in peace? How many more disputes are you going to get us involved in? Sir, he didn't misbehave there, right? No, dad. I went there like a gentleman. You jump walls like a Superman ...and say that you're a gentleman, fool. Go inside! Sorry, sir! Don't scold him. He's your boy. My daughter's wedding is in two days. Wedding? Why? When? Who is the groom? Why do you need all this? Go inside. Just to know the information. What information do you need? Go! Who is the groom? Same match. It is with her cousin. I will invite you to the wedding. You have to attend without fail. -Sure, sir -See you, sir. See you, sir. He's coming. Come... What's happening in the village? I heard that they have fixed the wedding of Krishnaveni and Subba Rao again. He is a very nice guy. He is a very innocent guy. I feel pity for him. -Why dude? -Krishnaveni eloped with Bujji, right? They were together for four months and came back silently after their breakup. Really? Of course. Anyway, second hand is second hand! From tomorrow, everyone in the village will call him 'Second Hand Subba Rao'. -[laughs] -Take out the umbrella It is obvious, isn't it? Hey, make it fast. Why are you so late? Of course, it will take time, sir. -This is a bicycle, not a motorcycle -Alright. Get to your work. I'll want to buy a motorcycle. Please give me an advance salary of 5000 rupees, sir. What? You are getting a motorcycle for 5000 rupees? Of course. We'll get a second hand motorcycle for that amount. There are so many advantages with a second hand motorcycle. Since someone might have already used it, it would come at a low price and ownership transfer would be very quick. What do you say, sir? Oh god! Why are you slapping me for telling the truth, sir? Get to the work. Don't you want coconut water? Get lost! Krishnaveni has got nothing to lose. But everyone is irritating me by calling 'second hand'. Hey Bujji, wait I'll ask you a question. Will you tell the truth? What truth? Nothing happened between you and Krishnaveni in Hyderabad, right? Never ask me that again. No comments. No comments? Please tell me. I don't want to dig the past. No comments! Poor guy, Bujji! Tell him what happened. No comments, for you as well. Bujji... Hey... Tell me... What happened? -Aunt, let's postpone the wedding -Why? -Making arrangements in a short notice... -Come to the point! What do you exactly want to say? We don't know if Krishnaveni came back home with the same purity... -Hey... -Shut up! If you talk one more word... -Listen to me, Aunt. -No! Let's cancel the wedding. I trust my upbringing. My daughter did not elope with anybody. She ran away because she don't want to marry you... all alone. -Stop all the wedding works -We should stop the wedding works. What will everyone in the town think about us? Why should I care about what people in our town think about us? All I care is my daughter, and her happiness. I have trust in my daughter Nothing else matters to me other than her happiness. Mom... This trust is all I need, mom. I will not cross the line ever again. I have slapped you on the other day not because you have slipped away. It's because you didn't tell me that you don't want to marry him. I am sorry! [singing karaoke] Singing: "Beat it..." You are singing as if a buffalo is moaning during its labour! -Singing: "Beat it... Beat it..." -Oh! Annoying! Stop it -Singing: "Beat it..." -Hell with your jumping around! My ears are vibrating! The ritual bell fell into the well while I was cleaning Pooja items. Please fetch it out from the well, dear. I need to start the Pooja. Why were you cleaning them near a well? Stop questioning! I need that ritual bell right now. Oh, you are asking me to fetch the ritual-bell from the well? Why are you whining about it? You used to jump and play in the well most of the time when you're a kid, didn't you? People are disparaging engineering students! You continue, dude. Aunt, I've failed in my degree exams. I'll fetch it for you. -Get it, son -Continue singing. That is apt for your face! Singing: "Just beat it..." Singing: "Beat it..." Ah! Why did she come here? Aunty... Aunty... You are Chamundeshwari's daughter Krishnaveni, right? Yes, Aunty. What brings you here, dear? Oh! Did you come here for Bujji? Yeah Bujji... Bujji... He is in the backyard, dear. Go and talk to him. I'll get you a cup of coffee. Okay, aunty. Bujji, I got you! -Bujji... -No... Bujji. Greetings -Bujji... -Who is it? -It is me... Krishnaveni. -Yes, tell me. Thank you for helping me. Okay... Okay... -I apologise for the trouble I gave you. -Apologies accepted. If you just come up, I'll apologize heartfully. Also, I got a gift for you. I will give it to you and leave. I don't need your apologies. Handover the gift to my mother and leave. No, I want to give it to you directly. Don't you understand? I have so much work in here. It'll take 2, 3, 4 to 5 hours to come out. It's alright! I'll wait for you. Oh man! What is this? She's getting latched to me as if TDP got latched by RGV! It might rain. You go home. I won't leave until you come out. -Then I won't come even if I die -You'll not come out? I'll see that. You... Hey... What are you doing? Will you kill my son with that stone? I'll complain to your mother and get you punished. You... Oh god! -Son, come up. -No, I will not come. The girl has left. Come out. Come... Come out quickly. Let's go to her home and complain about this to her mother. Mom... I am sorry, Krishnaveni. My father got into financial pressure because of me. And I was blamed for the mistake which I didn't do. Hence, I got no choice but to handover you to your family members. I didn't know at the time that you were Krishnaveni under the alias name of Swati. But after knowing the truth, I've felt very dejected. The feeling of dejection was so much that... -[Satya weeping] -I'll talk to you about when I meet you. You could have told this matter as well, when you meet her. Alright... Tell me the email ID. Take a printout. I've learnt this stuff in the town by paying them a fee of 10,000 rupees. There won't be any mistakes in this. Go and give this to her. Final? Certainly. Why don't take a picture of this letter and send it on her Whatsapp? -I'll hit you with footwear! -Think about this. Uhuh! This is the state of the friends since ages. [phone ringing] Phew! -Hello Swati. -Krishnaveni... I mean... Krishnaveni! -Sorry... -Sorry, dear! What for? Belated Happy Birthday! Thanks! Actually, I was waiting for you. But that rogue Bujji got me caught. -One second. -Okay. Phew! She still doesn't know that I'm Bujji. Yeah, tell me. So listen... The investor has agreed to fund our project. He also gave us a new office. And my mother has agreed to send me to Hyderabad. -One more second. -Okay! Phew! -Tell me -Why are you taking a gap in between? I did not take it. It just came. -What? -Birthday comes once a year. I was waiting for you for one full day. You should've at least texted me. I'm really sorry. My situation was bad. You didn't even have a concern that I was waiting for you. This is too much! I swear, I'm really sorry. Well... Where are you? Where will I be? I am here. -Hyderabad? -Of course, in Hyderabad. Did you think that I'd be in your hometown? Okay! I'll start now. We shall meet at new office tomorrow. I'll message you. -Bye! -Bye. [exhales deeply] Thank God! It's such a relief! Satthi! [scoffs] Please don't serve any tea or coffee to me now. -When did you come back from Hyderabad? -Why did you come here? -Bujji... -What Bujji? Bujji asked me to give you this letter [phone ringing] Excuse me. It is Bujji... Yeah, tell me dude. Hey, did you give the letter to her? Not yet, it's in my hands. Don't give it to her by any chance. I will be doomed. Oh no! Fifty percent of the paper is in her hands and the other fifty percent is in mine. Hey! I don't know what will you do, but don't give her the letter. -I'll kill you if you give it to her. -Okay. Unhold it. You are here to give it to me, right? He asked me not to give it to you. -Then, why did you come here? -He asked me to give it to you. -Then, give it -But now, he asked me not to give. -What is this letter? -Leave letter. -Why will he send a leave letter to me? -You are right. -It is a love letter. -Love letter? And for me? -No, it's for your mother -For my mother? What's in it? He might have written about your history with him in Hyderabad. -We had none. -He might have written the same. Is he trying to somehow prove me bad? There's nothing new to prove you as bad. People are already badmouthing about you. -Mommy... -Hey, stop! You are going to die in my hands today. -Wait -Hey... -Hey... -You are not Krishna-Veni. -You are a demonic-Veni -Hey buffalo, stop there! Ow! [people greeting] -Hi, I'm Sweety -Hi, I'm Rajesh. Hi. Srinu, our start-up company is all set to rock. Our lives would be settled. Hi... Krishna... -What is this? -Sweets. -Oh! -Distribute to everyone. -Give me one -Me as well. -What is this? -For me? -This is for Srinu -Woah! Special one for Srinu? Hey Srinu, she brought special sweets for you. -Give them to everyone -Hi. Hi... These are my village sweets. Thank you... [all]: Thank you... -Shall we start? -Hmm... Ah! What is this Bujjigadu? Exactly! What is Bujjigadu? How is Bujji related to our project? What did we come for? This is my project. I came here for this. We are dead! You've been into that in the hometown. And you want to continue it here as well? How do you know that? Since you've started doing this as soon as you came here. I thought so. What do you say? Yeah. I too thought the same. Anyhow, good things happened to you because of Bujji. You went back to your parents. Your marriage got cancelled. What else do you need? I think Bujji is a very good guy. When I asked you on the other day that if you had fallen in love with any guy, you said that you'd have informed me if you had any. I thought you were first hand. But I got to know that you are a second hand girl. What are you talking, cousin? Have you gone mad? Stop it! Bujji told me that both of you have done all the things which a couple would do. Don't act like an innocent! I'm not a fool! He is very astute. He has deactivated the Facebook account. Fools! -Let's keep that aside -What do you mean? What? Is it right to plan about Bujji who has been in your hometown? He is not in my hometown. He is in Hyderabad. I got the perfect information. So? An investor has trusted us with his money. And what are we doing? Why did we come here? What is our goal? What is our target? What's this mess? Yes, you are right. Thank you. -You be on that work. -Yes. Bhadram, Sweety, Hari let's work on Operation Bujjigadu. -Let's go to our cabin. -Hey... Hey... -Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni, stop... -Sweety. Hey, Bhadram... Hey... Bujji and Srinu are the same persons. Krishnaveni loves Srinu and hates Bujji at the same time. How will Bujji a.k.a Srinu come out of this problem? Siri: Go ahead. He is ruining my life. Who are you talking to, dude? I am talking to Siri, dude. I'm trying to find a solution. Siri: I'm not sure I understand. Siri, please try to understand. Siri: Did you try again? Oh man! It is asking me to say it from the beginning. -Siri: My apologies. -Siri has no solution as well. Mr Bujji, there is only one solution for this. What if we send Bujji to the USA? What if we kill Bujji? Hey... All those things won't work out. Do something. Meet her and tell everything directly to her. It is better to be transparent with the girl you love. Of course, I want to be like that. But if she gets to know this, she will not be in my life. I want her for a lifetime. What are you doing, Mr Bujji? I'm activating Bujji's Facebook account. Hey, Krishnaveni has deactivated her Facebook account. Is it? -[phone rings] -Krishnaveni is calling. Why did you deactivate your Facebook account? Yeah! How do you know? Did you do it? If not, I wanted you to do it. Why? Well, he can't be found if you try it from a new account. -We might find him with a new one. -Exactly! I got the same idea, so I have deactivated the account. Anyway, I have deleted him from my brain. -Really? -Okay! Forget all this. -Are you free now? -Totally. -Will you come with me? -Where? Oh! Kalakand Aunt's home? Shut up and come. Aunt... Hey, Krishna! -How are you? -I'm fine. You are Srinu, right? I forgot to tell you. Swetha sent a parcel from America. Go and check it. I'll get some coffee in the meantime. The parcel is over there. Krishna, how is everyone in your hometown? They are superb, aunt. It's been five years since I have visited my hometown. There was a big tree near the temple of tribal Goddess. Is it still there? No, they have chopped it during road widening. They will chop it if it is in the middle of the road. Anyway, they aren't sparing trees in these days. That's why we don't have enough oxygen now. Do you know how difficult is to breathe while walking on the roads? Hmm... Correct. One minute.. Phew! Don't you know how much careful you should be while playing two characters? Umm? -Sorry uncle. I didn't see you -What is this? Won't you let me work peacefully? -Please work peacefully, uncle. -Please. I will switch on the fan for you. No... No... No... No! There are only one and two, but no third one. No, sister. Everything is there. I've enquired in the store and bought them. Check it again. Hello, madam -All the three are in the same book. -Is it? Thank God! Hi, sir. How are you? I am superb. How are you? Yeah. Have you been meeting, Srujana? Hey, baby! How are you? Hey Srujju! How are you? Is everything okay? I am okay. I feel weak when I'm on my period. -What is it? -During my period... Can you go over there and talk with her privately? One minute... [scoffs] I'll talk about me later. Is Sunday Pillai around? -Srujana: Yeah. -Are you using him? No, dude. He is the one who has been using me in reverse. Oh no! What did you think? Did you expect every guy to be a fool like me? Hmph! What, baby? You took the shirt that I gave you to America as well? Yeah! I feel the pain of missing you whenever I wear it. I miss you so much. I miss you too, baby. -Srinu, shall we go? -Give me five minutes. Tell me when will you come to Hyderabad. Aunt, I'm leaving. What? I have prepared food for you. I don't want to eat. What's wrong, Krishna? Nothing. [scoffs] When a girl says there's nothing, it actually means that there's so much. I've been observing you. Since the time he started to talk on the phone, your mood has changed. Jealousy, right? -Or is he talking anything wrong? -No. Then, what is it? I don't know, Aunt. It is very painful. -You like Srinu, right? -Yeah! I like him so much. Did you tell him? It is that everything got settled at home very recently. I should first talk to my mother about it. Then, talk to her. Not me. You should talk to her. You should somehow convince her. Crazy girl! Oh, you have been hiding so much love for him in your heart? Alright! I'll talk to her. Thank you! Krishnaveni... -Shall we leave? -Yes. Let's go. Okay, I'm ready. -Shall we leave? -Where will you go? -You should have dinner here. Sit. -Okay, let's eat. [phone ringing] Tell me, father. You got a good wedding match from Hyderabad. A highly respected man have arranged this. Everything is perfect. If you go and meet the girl, we can talk about the rest of the things later. I can't go and meet her. I'm very busy now, father. It is not possible. Well... We'll do something. I will come to your place along with your mother. Then, all of us shall go and meet the girl. -Why? -Ow! You guys don't need to come here. Why? Well, it is not advisable to travel so long and come here in this hot temperature I will spare some time and meet her. Okay. Is it about matchmaking? -This is the planning of my father. -Why is this family planning for me then? -Stupid -I'll meet her and reject. It shall work. Don't force it so much, darling. Blue shirt girl... Ow! -Careful! -Thank you, sir. Why did she come here? Will she feel bad about me if she sees me with this girl? I'd better tell this to her. [phone rings] Srinu... Oh God! The way she is whispering suggests that she is upto something. What? I've arranged a wedding match for Bujji with a tramp. Oh... What? Shh! It's for Bujji. Hey, come with me. -Coming. -Quick. Do you even know the meaning of tramp? I know everything. I have arranged this intentionally. -Very interesting. Where's the venue? -Hotel California. I'm just beside it. Can I come and join? Okay. Come. Is she a tramp! To hell with my life! -Hi. -Hi, come sit. Did the gentleman you are looking for, arrive? Well... You did say that you removed Bujji from your brain, didn't you? That was yesterday but I have re-inserted him back today. Is this some kind of BP tablet to do so? Why are you feeling so bad? -Hello, come here. -Oh! She is calling me. -I'm talking to you, come here once -Us? Come... Come. Come! I have come here by shutting today's business. I came here expecting that you'd get my life settled by fixing my wedding with an innocent guy. -But what is this? -You don't worry. Your wedding will be fixed with Bujji for sure. Your life will be settled. -Did you call him after coming here? -I did. He said he's on the way. It's been already an hour. One hour? Idea! [phone rings] One minute Hello... No, sir. Nothing less than 30,000 rupees. -One month salary. -And, you will not find me later. I am going to get married within a week. So, think about it and call me back. And it is 30,000 rupees plus GST. Sorry, it was the customer. Call Bujji once. One second. -What? -I mean... Traffic... One hour... Time... -Well... Call him. -Okay. I think he has switched-off his phone. It is saying 'not reachable'. Idea! What if we take Bujji's number from her? -Then, we will have his number. -Excellent! -Super idea. -Fantastic idea. Amazing! I'll take it from her. Note it down. -Yes. Got it. -Noted? Yeah. [message notification tone] I think it is Bujji. I am okay with 30,000 rupees with GST. Please come. Sorry, it was a customer. Oh ma'am! There are lot of people waiting for you by holding their works. -Please go. -Okay. Call me if you need my service. -Idea -Hey... The ideas shouldn't be spontaneous If you take some time to think, you'll get bigger and strong ideas. Listen to me. We'll check this number in Truecaller app. And we can find his photo, email ID and all his details. You smart girl! I wonder when you have developed this clever skills! I never thought you would be so intelligent. Tell me his number. I will search myself know. I will do it myself. Ah! This guy? Srinu, do you remember him? No, I don't remember. He travelled with along us in the train when we met for the first time. Oh! Right! What a coincidence! Yes! Now, I got the clear picture. I am hundred percent sure that he is Bujji. -This is his number, right? -Yes. -I'll save it. -Oh my God! I'll take you to task, Bujji. Bujji, my show starts now "Hey, you troublesome and exasperating girl..." "I've been pursuing you and my plan got ruined. What did I achieve?" "I'm an innocent guy" "Do not ravage me, Krishnaveni" "I am the guy who is head over heels for you" "Don't try to kill me, Krishnaveni" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "I fell in love with you on the day when I met you on the passenger train" "We had good time chatting on Messenger and Whatsapp" "I felt exalted when you've smiled like the mist of the November month" "And I have preserved you in my heart like the flower of the December month" "But you've torn the calender and got bursted like a cyclinder... Boom!" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "I'm the most remarkable guy in my town" "But I became a scapegoat in your mother's plot" "And my father has been misled" "As I couldn't understand any of this, I've been binging on booze" "We have been dreaming together all these days" "But today, you've become my nightmare" "I'm someone who who can't live without you even for a moment" "But you've been hissing like a snake on the bed" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" -[phone ringing] Hey, just wait... "But I am head over heels for you..." -Stop it guys... -[phone ringing] Master... -Cut sound... Hello. I found Bujji. Let's meet at office tomorrow. What happened? -She said she found Bujji, master. -You are Bujji, right? That's what I'm not understanding, master. I need to go urgently. -Please. -Alright. Go. Thank you, master. Hey Bujji! All the best! Look! The one who is sitting in the boss's room is Bujji. How come he is here? He is the brother-in-law of our boss. Brother-in-law of our boss? So you'll forget about your revenge on him? We will get back to our routine, right? We shouldn't spare our enemy if he is in a higher position than us. We have to knock him down in a deceit manner. Srinu, sir is calling you. [singing] Hi bro, come on. You never imagined that you'd work with someone you met on the train, right? That is called destiny. Move... Move... It is wrong, isn't it bro? What is wrong in that? She's been directly looking into my eyes. She is in love with me, bro. -Are you sure? -Sure? Can't you see it? Love, care, feelings and affection is clearly visible on her eyes. All those emotions are for me. I'll set this in a week, bro. Only one week. -One minute... -Okay. One minute... He is the apt guy to seek your revenge. All the best! Thank you! "The matter is so simple but the things that are at stake are very big" "The life of Bujji has become confined to the roads" "She is the girl of his interest but she is giving him jitters" -"Everything is going upside down for him" -[groaning in pain] "He thought he'd marry her" "But she is waiting on the roads sharpening a knife to end his life" "I don't know how much serious this is..." "But my life is making me carry my own dead body" -"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." -Oh my rear is on fire! Fire... "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" -"But I am head over heels for you..." -Hey... Ow! [phone ringing] Hello. Srinu, my father is here. Will you meet him? Yeah! Who? My father is here. No, I can't. Why? I am suffering from fever. Fever? Did you go to the hospital? Yes. Good. Then, come and meet us. No, I meant... I must go. You'll go now? The battery is dying. Hello... Hello... Hello... Hel... Hel... He... He... [disconnects phone] I'll leave, dear. -Why don't you stay back? -Ah! I meant... stay here for some time since the train is in the evening. -What will you do by going now? -Well, dear... Koteshwar Rao asked me to handover a gift to his son. I've been calling to his mobile but it has been busy and now it is switched off. I wonder where that idiot is hanging around. Why is Bujji's picture here? Bujji is working here. Is it? You have lessened my work. Call him. We should go to hospital to meet Bujji. What happened? He met with an accident yesterday and got hospitalised. Oh no! Come, let's go and see him. Why, dad? We hail from the same village, dear. And we don't know if his parents know about this. Let's go, dear. -Come, let's go -Dad... -A guy from my town has been admitted here -Both of you can't go at a time. -Visit him, one by one. -Okay. -Dad, I'll go and tell him. -Yes, you go. Idiot, why did you pull it off? It felt nice when you were pulling it. Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni... You came here to see me? I can't believe... I can't believe... My father is here to meet you. You father came here to meet me? You mean father-in-law? [stammers] -He told me about some parcel. -Okay, call him. I'll manage something. Call him. -She's here. -You go, dad. I'll go. Hello, sir. Hello. Here! -You are Krishnaveni's father, right? -Yeah Come... Come... Have a seat... Have a seat. Come... Sit here, sir. -You got a gift for me? -It is not for you. Hey! Oh no! There are no fruits or snacks to offer you. -Well, sir. Take this Oxygen -Yuck! It has your Carbondioxide in it. -Take it, sir. It is good for health. -Don't know where he has kept that. Inhale this oxygen for your health benefits. Krishnaveni came here for me... Krishnaveni... Hey... Hey... -Why are you here? -Srinu is suffering from fever. -Are there no other rooms? -Are there no other rooms? Cost cutting if it is in the same room. He's doing favour for the employer. Do you have any problem? Why will I have a problem? It'll trim the bill for my brother-in-law and I will have a company as well. -The company is yours, right? -I was talking about his company with me. Oh! What do you mean Bujji is not inside, dad? There is an crazy guy inside. Of course, Bujji is a crazy guy! What are you talking, dear? Dad, let's check. Sir, come on take a puff. Damn! Why is this crazy guy behind me? Srinu, why are you here? Fever. This crazy guy's name is Srinu? Dad, this is Srinu. He works in our office. Oh! Hi! -All three: Hi! -Bujji, how are you feeling now? Not bad, uncle. Since it is a fever, the doctor advised to talk less. Yeah! He told me the same too Dad! Talk to Srinu as well. Srinu, how are you feeling? I feel better now. But the doctor has to diagnose me again. Bro, why is he calling me Srinu? No, he's talking to Srinu only. No! Sir, did you look at Srinu and called his name? Yeah! I told you, right? Don't go overboard. -He was telling that to you. -No, he was telling you. -It was for you. -It was for you. -It was for you. -It was for you. -Bro, whom were you telling that? -To me... I was telling to myself! Srinu, why are you creating a big scene here? I'm observing him since I have arrived, he's been making a scene. Stop it, dad. Srinu would feel bad. -When will they leave? I'm tensed. -How would I know dude? Sister... When will visiting hours close? If there's no one else coming, I'll close it. -There's no one else. -There's no one else. Hey, how can you say that? Don't you think I will not inform this to anyone? Bujji, I have called your parents. -They might come here anytime -Did you tell them? How could you tell them, sir? How could you? Why? Shouldn't I inform them? -What, dear? -You should of course inform them, dad. Why should we hide this matter? -Why not? -[stammers] You shouldn't inform them and that's final. You shouldn't inform them. Did my parents recommend for my job at my brother-in-law's office? They didn't do that. What am I talking and what is he talking? Well... Why is he talking? Who is Srinu? Who is Bujji? Sir, pain doesn't differentiate Bujji or Srinu. Pain might be endured either by Bujji or Srinu. But it doesn't mean that Bujji's pain would be soft and Srinu's pain would make a scene, sir. -Listen to me... -Shut up! What is all this? My husband got a heart operation done yesterday. Who will take responsibility if something bad happens to him again? -[panting] [using asthma inhaler] -Please go, ma'am. You are already out of breath. There's a crazy guy here. Please go. -Come dear, let's go -Let's go, dad. Uncle, you got some gift for Bujji but going back without giving it to him... Ow! Nice. -You have good manners. Give this to Bujji -Thank you, uncle. -To Bujji... -I should give this to Bujji, right? Yeah. Bujji, where do you want me to place this? -Keep it in the centre -In the center? Why did you place it there? It was you who told me to place it in the centre, right? Not here... The other center. Oh! The other centre? -Yeah -Why did you place it there? I placed it in the centre since I was told so. Center means... You said something sensible for the first time. -Yeah. -Good! Thank you, uncle [phone rings] Hello! Yes, Mr Koteshwar Rao. -Ah! -Oh is it? It is Bujji's parents'. They came after visiting hours and they were stopped. Excuse me, sir. Please give me the phone -Get that. -Please give me Uncle... Hello! Give the phone to the person beside you. Talk to him. -Sir. -My parents are here. They were stopped citing closure of visiting hours. Send them inside. -Okay, sir. You can go, sir. -Okay. What is this dude? -Madhu... -Don't know if he is killing or helping. -Madhu... Hey Madhu... -Yes. Come here. Sir, they are not your parents. Why did you say like that? They will send them only if we talk like that. -How was it? -Too much! Einstein. Earlier, he was talking nonsense and now, he claims them to be his parents? Maybe he's not mad at them now. They are parents at the end of the day. -No, dear... -Krishnaveni, since the parents are coming they might object if there are so many people here. If both of you go outside, they will come inside. -Okay -Let's go, dear. Stop! Who will object you? I am here. I will take care. Stop there. Sir, please calm down. Sir, please leave. Come, dear. Sir, I'll be hurt if you leave. I'll break my head with this. Don't go. Everyone will have their own problems. Let them go. Calm down, bro. This is my prestige issue. Don't go, sir. I think his madness has aggravated. I told you, right? But the positive aspect in his madness is that, he says that he would hurt himself but not us. You're right, dad. Please kill him. I'll even sell my kidneys in organ-bank downstairs and pay you. I will kill this bugger! [heavy breathing] -Do something, dude. -Well, I'll get your parents. All of you, wait here. Go, get them fast. -Madhu... -Madhu... Madhu... -What happened? -Madhu... -Wait... Where are you going? -Bujji... Uncle, I'm so much stressed and tensed about the patient's condition. You don't worry, uncle. -You sit... Please sit. -Madhu... -Please sit here. -Madhu, tell me what happened You don't worry. Sit here. -The patient's condition is very critical -Madhu. Doctor, I'm seeing beautiful girls when I got to sleep at night. But they are vanishing upon waking up. What should I do to meet them directly, doctor? -Hey, who are you? What are you talking? -Okay doctor. I'll do that for sure. Are you mad? Sister, the doctor just advised me to maintain a diet. What do you recommend, sprouts or brown rice? What do you include in your diet? -Uncle, I'll take care of it -Madhu... Do you think if I should eat or fast? What is your favourite restaurent, Minerva or Chutneys? We did all what we can do. But there is no use. -Yes, sir. -There is no use of hiding this anymore. -You explain to everyone clearly. -Sure, sir. -What happened? -Please... Please... Doctor... Oh God! -Madhu... -Madhu... -Madhu... -What happened to our son? What happened to Bujji, Madhu? Tell me, Madhu. Sir, your son is not in that room. He is in the corner room to your right side. Is it? He says that our son is not in this room. Uncle, I was not worrying for our Bujji all this while. I will kill you! Come... -Sinister! -[stammers] Bujji, what happened? Mr Koteshwar Rao, they are conducting some tests on him. Wait for sometime. Sir, there is another guy in the room. Who is he? He is your son's colleague. -He is suffering from fever -Oh sad! She is Krishnaveni. You know her, right? Of course, we know her. The patient is very weak. Don't disturb him. Okay. Bujji, how are you feeling? I'm talking to you. Why are you not talking? Look, sir. We came here from so far by taking so much trouble and he's not talking to us. Of course, parents will be complaining. But do you need to show your resentment even at this time, Bujji? Yes! Yes! Of course, he will vent anger. Should he hide it or what? Zip it, crazy man! We have been talking something and you've been telling us something else. What is wrong in what he said, sir? He was right indeed. Why are you talking in the middle? He is my son and he'll do whatever he wants to do. What's with your restriction in that? Please don't talk harshly to her. It pains me here. Super, brother! I was about to say the same and you have said it out. Do you understand at least now? You've been pampering him by showering love. Come on, Koteshwar Rao. Why are you fighting over the blabbering of a crazy guy? How dare you call me a crazy guy! -It is you who is crazy. -Hey bloody crazy guy! -Krishnaveni. -I'll kill you! Die... Die... Die... Die... Die... Die... Krishnaveni. -Die... Die... Die... -Ow! Ouch! Hey Madhu... -Die... Die... -He's killing me What happened? Stop this. I have stopped! Srinu: I asked you stop this mess, not the power supply. Oh no! -Krishnaveni... -There are CC cameras here -Escape from here. -What about you, dad? It's okay even if I go to jail for three years but he shouldn't be alive. Leave, dear. Leave... Hoe dare you to hit me? What do you think of me? If I lose my mind, I will take everyone to task! [electricity buzzes] Oh God! Run... Run... Run... -What about, Srinu? I'll take care. -Sai, see you. -Okay, sir. Son, you're getting late to the work. Go to your office. We'll leave. Okay. -Bye, son. -Come. -Call me once you reach. -Okay. [phone rings] Hello. I'm on my way to office. Do you want me to pick you up? I have to meet the general secretary in the secretariat. My dad gave me some work. You go ahead. I'll come directly. Drive. Well... Mr Bujji... There is already booking for the cab. You are too much hoggish. Hello, excuse me. I did not book a share-ride. Sir, he's my friend. He'll get down on the way. You sit back comfortably It's okay. Sorry, sir. He's my friend. He'll get down on the way. He'll get down before the completion of my ride, right? No, sir. You will be the one to get down first and later, him. What is this? Am I the one who booked the cab or him? -That is.. -[coughs] Thanks, bro. -Hi, bro. This is Gautham. -Hi. Hi, I am Sai... Pammi Sai. Mr Sai, please concentrate on the road. I'm meeting a girl in a coffee shop for the first time as a part of matchmaking. Oh! All the best, bro. It is alright that it is your first time. What about the girl, sir? -Mr Sai, shut up! -Bye, bro. -Bye. -Thank you Thank you sir [honks] Oh no! He forgot his purse. I'll go and give this to him, Mr Bujji. [honks] Maybe he didn't finish his morning chores at his home. He is in a rush. Damn! That idiot is relentless! -Give the wallet. I'll go and give it. -Okay, Mr Bujji. My dad does things like this all the time. -No, I didn't have any plans. -Bro... -I have few ideas... -You forgot this in the cab. Thank you so much, bro. And by the way, she's the bride. I know her very well. -She works in our office. -Srinu, the thing is that... I know that the world is small. But never thought it is this small. Your dress is very nice, madam. Looks like you wore this specially for matchmaking. Bro, please sit. -Coffee? -No, bro. I have a meeting with the general secretary in the secretariat. My daddy asked me to attend it. -I'll go. -Bye. Nice dress, madam. [doorbell dings] Krishnaveni... Why did you come here at this time? Srinu's phone is still switched off. Where is he? I don't know where he is. Anything urgent? There was a small misunderstanding. Ask him to call me whenever he comes home regardless of the time. Sure, I'll tell him. It is about to rain. Do you want me to drop you? No, the cab is waiting for me. -Okay -Bye. Bye. Go safe. [music mutes voice] So that is the basic... You'll think however you want? I'm in a important meeting -Later... -This is more important Listen to me and understand You are not trying to understand me. What's happening here? -Actually... -I am head over heels for you. Oh, she's proposing her love? Guys, let's take a break. How can think that everything you see is true? Doesn't your heart know about me? Back at my home, I promised my mom that I would abide by her decision regarding my wedding. It was the wedding match that was sent by her. I didn't tell you about the match because I would anyway reject it. You have looked at me as if I am a cheater. I've been so much dejected since yesterday's morning. Can't you get it clarified by making a phone call? Why will you do that? You'll have trust on someone only if you feel they are yours. Hmph! You are mine. You are mine. I'm saying this heartfully. Congratulations! -All the best. -Thank you. Srinu, I can't take this tension anymore. I'll call my parents and you call yours. -Let's have a meeting and convince them. -Okay. Dude, Krishnaveni has started. She might come here anytime I came her long ago. Oh! Late news? What are you doing? We planned to arrange a meeting for our parents. Really? Then, whose parents are you going to call? Your parents or Bujji's? Oh! There is a hitch here, right? I'll go to her right away and tell that I'm Bujji. For the first time, you took a right decision at the right time. All the best. [phone rings] I was about to call you, father. Are you missing me, son? Yeah, father. I am missing you as well. Son, there is a good news for you. What is it, father? We have been breeding a country chicken at our home, right? Yes. -We got it butchered. -Is it? And we have prepared delicious Biryani with that. Superb, father! But what's the occassion? We booked a case against Chamundeshwari. Why, father? How could she six contracts to the same person consecutively? They have set up an enquiry committee to probe. If this gets proved, she'll get suspended. There is also a chance that she might go to jail. Celebrations starts! No one knows that you are the part of the team who filed that case, right? I'm not in the team, son. I am the head of the team. Everyone in the town knows about this. And I've been calling and informing those who doesn't know about this. See you, son. There are several people who I should pass this news. What happened? What a timing, dude! When your luck bags a bronze medal, your ill-fate is getting gold. I wonder if she knows about this news. There's no sound yet. So I don't think she knows it. Krishnaveni: Srinu... -All the best. -Srinu... Srinu, Bujji's father has filed a complaint against my mother. She has been temporarily suspended and an inquiry commission has been set up. [tyres screech] How come you have arrived without any information? Hey, I'm talking to you. Shall I get you a cup of coffee? [phone rings] Tell me. Everyone is on the line. I'm connecting the video call. Okay. Bujji, can you hear me? This is Satya with a selfie camera. We are now at attendar Ramaswamy's house. He is upset because of the allegations made against his madam. I'll kick you. Say it properly He is a genuine person. He is nowhere related to those allegations. He is so innocent that he drinks alcohol without diluting water in it citing contamination. Over to Gangaraju Chamundeshwari and the president of the society bank are not on good terms. But the news is that he is no way connected to this. We don't we have any source. What should we do? Why is no one talking? Your father is behind you... Your father is behind you! -Your father -What are you doing? I'm making TikTok videos with friends. Are you doing TikTok videos or something else? You would do something and get everyone of us in trouble, all the time. That is what you do, right? [phone ringing] -Is it him again? -Yes. Why do you get into all the unnecessary issues? [phone ringing continuously] -What happened? -Swamy Naidu is calling. He has been intimidating your father on the phone since yesterday... ...to withdraw the case. Switch on the speaker. What's with you Koteshwar Rao? Are you goofing around? -I've been observing you since yesterday -That's not the case, sir. Don't give excuses. I don't have time to listen to all your nonsense. Withdraw the case immediately. Else, my men will come to you and worsen your situation. Got it? Think about it. Where does Swamy Naidu stay? -Hello -Mr Koteshwar Rao. Where are you going along with your son? Swamy Naidu has threatened unaware of the fact that my son is a tiger. Will he spare him? He will finish him today. -Sir, forget about my father. -Oh God! She's a sincere officer, sir. It will ruin her career. Tell me how did you know get to know the details of the tender. Please, sir. How did submit the tender with a mere difference of 1000 to 2000 rupees? Please tell me, sir. What should I tell you? Bugger off! Puny youngster! What are you staring at? Get to the work. Okay, master. [clatters] Swamy Naidu... How did you get to know the details? Hey guys! Why the hell are you minding your work when he is going overboard here? Come and handle him. Son, let's go back. They are like elephants. And you look like a filament [groans] Sir. Please tell me how did you get to know the details. Please, sir... [glass shatters] Please wait, uncle. I'm talking here, right? Sir. Please tell me how did you get to know the details. [groans] Hey! Hey! [groans] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey... I'll break your head. How dare you to show your rowdyism in front of me? Listen to me... I bribed Chamundeshwari and she leaked it. Go and ask her. I'll shoot you if you try to do anything smart here. -Mind it! -Sir... Sir... He is an idiot, sir. He doesn't know anything. You are a gentleman, sir. He is a dog, sir. Why do you mess with him, sir? -Please, come, sir... -Mind it, idiot! What are you thinking when he told you directly? Chamundeshwari got bribed and leaked the quotation. She's not such a lady. As if she's so pure! -Not to commit any mistake... -Babu has the video with proof. -Hey! -Bujji! Hey... Why are you not picking up my calls? If so, would you come directly to home? However, I called you so many times. Did you take them? Don't show me your ego now! We've installed a camera in Chamundeshwari's cabin, didn't we? Do you have its footage? -How much do you want? -How much do you have? How much ever you want! It's running from the time you asked me to install it. Look here. Take it if you want. He is overacting! See! Hmm. Did anyone see this video? Swamy Naidu's brother-in-law watched it and took the footage. How can you give him like that? Do you want to say something? If you stay silent, considering that you've committed the crime, we will have to take you into custody. Excuse me, would you take her into custody? On what grounds would you take her into custody? Many roads and schools have been constructed in all the villages surrounding this town. Who is the reason behind it? It's because of her. We won't tolerate if Koteshwar Rao is trying to frame us by keeping personal disputes in his mind. Inspector sir, please, clear everything. We must take her into custody. Excuse me. I need to talk for a minute. Yes, proceed. One year ago, Koteswar Rao's son, Bujji ran away from this village because of a reason. And on the same day, Chamundeshwari's daughter Krishnaveni too ran away from her house. They got the tenders not because Chamundeshwari leaked it, but it's because of the video camera footage which was installed by Bujji. It has all the proofs related to it. Madam, here are the files. Okay, you may go. Okay, madam. You are correct. As you said, Chamundeshwari is there. Her daughter is there. Koteshwar Rao is also there. The one who placed the camera is also there. But where is the culprit, Bujji who's behind all of this? Hey! Why did you come here and what are you talking? You please, wait. Sir, I am that Bujji. We are cancelling all the tenders that they got in this wrong process. We are giving a clean chit to the sincere officer Chamundeshwari. Inspector, take him into custody. It's not like I was betrayed but it feels like I lost my life. That's not the case, Krishnaveni. [weeping] Hmm! Gautam called me. What do you want me to say? Huh? Daddy... Alright. Tell me what you feel. Okay. Good girl. Bujji, Krishnaveni agreed to marry someone else. "The eyes that have seen dreams..." "...are now filled with tears" "And the heart that shared loved is wounded" "Our steps that walked together..." "...have now become lonely" "The light that gave a shadow is left with darkness" "The life, unable to" "bear the pain of the preserved love in it," "severed its bond" "And the silence has grown so much distance between us" "The eyes that have seen dreams..." "...are now filled with tears" "And the heart that shared loved is wounded" "Our steps that walked together..." "...have now become lonely" "The light that gave a shadow is left with darkness" Let's take care of the rest after the wedding. -Okay, sir. -Father. Yes, dear. One minute. You work on this. -Okay, sir. -I'll speak to him later on the call. Come on, sit down, dear. [sighs] Srinu is going to Japan. Let him go. How does it matter to us? What happened, dear? Sir, I am the team leader for this project. And I know who's the best person to got to Japan. Konda Srinivasa Rao alias Bujji, is the right person to go. Excuse me, sir. Yeah. -I object Krishnaveni. -Why? I am also equally eligible to go to Japan, sir. Hey, let me go! At least people might stay peaceful after I leave. Mr. Srinivas, I'm not supporting you keeping personal reasons in mind. -Company needs this so I am supporting. -[sighs] Aren't you doing this considering personal reasons? Didn't you cheat me? I thought lying would be better than telling you the truth and hurting you. I just hid the truth, but I didn't cheat you. Oh, if you're so genuine, then why didn't you tell me the truth once you got to know that I am Krishnaveni? You would've told your parents than escaping from... ...your wedding that you don't like your brother-in-law, right? They were not ready to listen to me. Exactly! You are still not in a position to understand! [sighs] Sir, are you understanding now? She is trying to send Srinivas from here by keeping personal grudges in mind. What is this Krishnaveni? Sir, Srinu is very talented. Which is why I supported him. You rejected this idea for the first time when I explained it to you. The second prototype is his idea. And he never tried to take the credit. In fact he supported me being in the team. The Japan deal, he is the one who cracked it. Not all this, even when he knew I would reject his love after knowing he is Bujji... he saved my mom. Guys, I'm convinced. No more discussions. Srinu is the right guy for the job. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Go to Hyderabad immediately for visa processing. I'll let them know. Okay, sir. Okay? See you guys in the office Good job, Krishnaveni! When you have developed feelings for a person, it means that you have liked that person's pros as well as his cons. Happy married life. Our intention was not to stop Srinu from going to Japan, Krishnaveni It was only to stop him going away from your life. Hmm! Who do you know, Srinu or Bujji? It's Srinu. -What type of person is Srinu? -He is a very nice guy, daddy. Then, what about Bujji? [sighs] Will you leave a person you loved for someone whom you have never met? [phone rings] Tell me, Ms Krishnaveni, the team leader. I'm the team leader Krishnaveni's father speaking. Uncle. Call my daughter immediately. To which number should I call her, uncle? Call to this number. Not just her but her father is also crazy. We shouldn't compromise, dear. He'll only call. What should I do if he calls me? Let's forgive. How will I be a good girl if I have such a father? [phone ringing] That's him. Hello, brother-in-law. Hey, Raja Ravindra! Yeah. The wedding didn't happen yet. Don't call me with relations. We'll get confused. Okay. Daddy. [clears throat] Srinu. Hmm! I'm sorry, dear. I want you. Do you want Bujji or Srinu? I want both. How much more time is left for the wedding? It's hardly two hours. You should have confessed it after the wedding. It would have been good riddance! Srinu...! There is no deart of this affection! Okay, it's the same station and the same train. Let's elope. Okay. I'll keep all the gold inside and come. Hey, get everything carefully. We don't even know when we will return. I'd need a lot of money to maintain you. -Hey! I'll take you to the task later. -Bullabbai, Take the garlands and keep them there. Why are you on call now, dear? I'm talking to the groom, grandma. [gasps] [gasps] Oh God! She might repeat the same thing. Groom is not on call... She is not here. She is missing again. Did you see Koteshwar Rao's son? -He is also missing. -[gasps] Don't worry. Let's not misunderstand. Don't repeat the same mistake. -Koteshwar Rao... -Sir... Please tell your son and ask him to find my daughter. Sir, Tiger... My son is a Tiger. Give me a minute. [dialling] Hello. Son, you are going to Hyderabad without informing it seems. How do you know, father? I've placed a satellite camera. Okay, but... ...Chamundeshwari's daughter has eloped again it seems. What's wrong with her? She elopes whenever they arrange a wedding! How will we know their issues, dear? Okay, but father... There is no problem with any cheque, right? No, son. I behaved intelligently this time. Okay but you should somehow catch her. I'm already holding her, father. What are you talking? You are an elderly person. Please try to understand. Oh no! Oh God! Sir, my son said that he'll catch your daughter. Sir, my son is a Tiger. -My son is a tiger... -Excuse me, Tiger's father... Oh no! Congratulations! Did they inform you while they were leaving? -Yeah -Oh no! [music] "Hey, you troublesome and exasperating girl..." "I've been pursuing you and my plan got ruined. What did I achieve?" "I'm an innocent guy" "Do not ravage me, Krishnaveni" "I am the guy who is head over heels for you" "Don't try to kill me, Krishnaveni" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "I fell in love with you on the day when I met you on the passenger train" "We had good time chatting on Messenger and Whatsapp" "I felt exalted when you've smiled like the mist of the November month" "And I have preserved you in my heart like the flower of the December month" "But you've torn the calender and got bursted like a cyclinder... Boom!" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "I'm the most remarkable guy in my town" "But I became a scapegoat in your mother's plot" "And my father has been misled" "As I couldn't understand any of this, I've been binging on booze" "We have been dreaming together all these days" "But today, you've become my nightmare" "I'm someone who who can't live without you even for a moment" "But you've been hissing like a snake on the bed" "Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "The matter is so simple but the things that are at stake are very big" "The life of Bujji has become confined to the roads" "She is the girl of his interest but she is giving him jitters" -"Everything is going upside down for him" -[groaning in pain] "He thought he'd marry her" "But she is waiting on roads sharpening a knife to end his life" "I don't know how much serious this is..." "But my life is making me carry my own dead body" -"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..." "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni" "But I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni" "I am head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"
