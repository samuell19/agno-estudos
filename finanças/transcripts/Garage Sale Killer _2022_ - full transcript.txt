Okay, that'll be $10, please. -Here you go. -Thank you. Thank you. -Have a nice day. -Thanks. Hi. See anything you like? I love these old lampshades. They were my mother's. They're beautiful. I was curious. Is there anything else inside the house that you might be selling? Yeah. Yeah, come on. Linda, watch the box. Look at all of this. There's a lamp you might like down the hall. This door? Keep goin'. Wow. What do you think of that? Oh my lord, look at this. 1912. Vintage. Mother loved collecting old things. I miss her. Every day. Go ahead. Touch it. Feel how... smooth it is. Stop! Stop him! I gotta go. Let's go, go, go. Help! Stop them! Woo-Hoo-Hoo! How much? $2,400 and change. Woo-Hoo! And... I got you this. Oh my gosh, I love her. Not bad for 10 minutes of work. Candice! Candice, can you help me? Please, honey, it'll just take a minute. I have a big shoot next week and I'm trying to get my mood board done. I told you, I'm on a deadline. It's due Monday. I'm on a deadline, too, honey. The garage sale's tomorrow. People are gonna be here at dawn. What was our agreement? -What? -I said, and specifically, that I would help you put items in the front yard on the day of the garage sale, not before, on the day. And by checking the time, I can see, oh, gee, would you look at that, it's 11:00 P.M., it is not the day yet. I just need you to help me advertise it. -Advertise it? -Yeah, you know, the thing you do with your cellphone in your media class? Livestream? You want me to livestream your garage sale? Oh, god, please no. I just want you to invite all of your friends. You have, like, a thousand followers, right? Just tell them and their parents to drop by tomorrow. I'm a serious journalist, mom. I don't do commercials for garage sales. Fine, then show me how to do it. Okay, here. You go to the website like that, you click that button, hit "livestream media," then hit the red button, and then you're live. Now I've got work to do. Please do it for me? I'll never figure this out. Please? Fine. Hey, you guys, Candice here. My mom is having another garage sale tomorrow, this is the fourth one this year, and she's got a lot of cool stuff to sell. So, tell your peeps come on by, she's got lemonade, cookies. It'll be fun. Say hi, mom! Hi, everybody, I hope you can make it. Just take the 5 to the 14th north... I...I'll post the address. All right, I'll see you all here tomorrow. Peace out. Bye! -Thanks, that'll really help. -I doubt it. I keep telling you, nobody wants to buy your stuff, mom. One woman's trash is another woman's treasure. And I'm sick of living in a junkyard. It's 4:00 in the morning. Where are you going? Where the hell's it look like? Work. -No, you hate that job. -What else is new? Gotta pay the rent. Have you seen the car keys? -You're not going. -Come on, I'm gonna be late. Well, you don't need that gig anymore. We made a lot of money yesterday. Yeah, and it was fun, but it was a one-time thing. Can you just give me the... No! What if it was not a one-time thing? You wanna do it again? I'm thinkin' about it. You know how many estate sales are advertised online every weekend? I mean... no cameras. No security guards. Just a bunch of dumb rich people selling their stuff. Easy. You sound just like dad. I sound like dad? How is that? He's a con artist and a thief. -Mm. -Taught you right. He taught us both right, little sister. Besides, you've been paying my bills the last couple of months, this is the least I can do. Let's talk about this when I get back from work. Made 2400 bucks in 10 minutes. Think about it. ♪ do what you've gotta do and take it to the top ♪ ♪ a one-way ticket now, we can't lose tonight ♪♪ Oh, yeah, that will be the $2.50. Great. Out of five? There we go. And why don't you go have some lemonade? I have some cookies right over there as well. Thank you. Okay, that's it from the den. Can I go now? Actually, honey, I need you to help me set up those books. Do you see that box underneath the table right there? This garage sale is not allowed by the homeowners' association. Hi, Evelyn. How're you doing? This is the fifth garage sale you've had in the last 18 months. And we've sent you how many warnings? At least a hundred. Listen, Evelyn, I'm not bothering anybody, and I'm keeping everything on my side of the property. -You get the bylaws, right? -I get the bylaws. -Do you read them? -Of course I read them. Is there a reason why you don't respect them? I'm not trying to disrespect the bylaws. Do you want me to quote the bylaw? It specifically says all yard sales, estate sales, garage sales are not allowed in this subdivision. There's like 30 bucks in the box. Let's come back later. I'm gonna see what they got in the house. -Don't. -Shh. I got this. Is anybody complaining? Do you guys mind if I do this? No, we love it. Can I get you some lemonade? Don't patronize me, Marcia. Look, Evelyn, I am begging you. Please let me have this sale. I need the money. Yeah, well, we all need money. My husband's dead. My kids are gone. I live by myself. And you know what? Somehow, I manage to pay the bills. Maybe you should think about getting a job. Hey, why don't you leave my mother alone before I kick your ass up and down the street? I'm reporting you to the board. This... is going to cost you. You don't deserve that. Who is that woman? Eh, she's the head of HOA. I'd say she's a royal pain the butt. She's right, I am breaking the rules. -I like your style. -Hm. You have a really nice sale. Appreciate that. I'll be right back. How old is this? Do you know the age? Ah... this is my aunt Dorothy's. So I don't know... -I think, um... -I'd say like 1920s? Older, turn of the century, at least. Really? -Wow, that's amazing. -I know. Where do you get all of this stuff? Friends, families, other people's garage sales. I get that. It doesn't matter where I'm driving to, if I see a garage sale, I pull over. -Do you do that? -Well... She does that. Excuse me. Hey! What are you doing? -Hey! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -Let me go! -No, you can't have that. Let go of me, lady! Oh my god. Mom? Someone call the police! Candice, call 911! Quickly. Okay. Hello? Yes, there's been an emergency, um... Hi, hi, yes, hi, um, my name is Marcia Clattenburg, I caught a burglar in my house. He fell down the stairs. He's not breathing and I can't find a pulse. No, he's not moving at all. Yeah, okay, yeah, I'm listening. How do you spell your last name? Clattenburg. C-l-a-t-t-e-n-b-u-r-g. Ms. Clattenburg, did you advertise the garage sale online? Yeah, we did. Well, my daughter did. Okay. And how long was he in the house, do you think? I don't know, maybe five minutes. And he just knew exactly where your jewelry was, where you keep your cash? What are you implying? I'm not implying anything, I just think it's a little odd. I mean, total stranger comes to your garage sale, goes into your house, and in under five minutes finds all your valuables. My guess would be that he's been in your house before or that you knew him. I did not know him. You didn't see him around the neighborhood? Maybe you threw a party, right? Someone else brought him. No, my mom doesn't throw parties. This place is too much of a mess to throw parties. I have no idea who he was. A lot of people come to these garage sales. You know how it goes. He had zero identification on him, so we ran prints through our national database, found nothing. Can't tell you his name or anything. Typical John Doe. -You got lucky, Ms. Clattenburg. -How's that? Well, it could have been you who fell down those stairs. Next time you catch a burglar in your house stealing jewelry, just let him go. It's just... stuff. We should move. We should get the hell out of here. I'm sick of living in this mess. Don't say that. If you wouldn't have all these stupid garage sales, we wouldn't have all these creepy people crawling around our house. You bring junk into your life, mom. Junky antiques and junky people. Candice... Good morning. This is the last one. I'm trying to get the house clean so you're not upset with me all the time. Hi, let me know if I can help you find anything. Actually, I'm looking for the homeowner. Oh, well, that's me. What can I do for you? Mom! Hi, let me know if I can help you find anything. Yeah, I'm looking for like, um, a lamp for a table in my living room. Do you have anything from the 1950s? Maybe something red? You look familiar. Have we met before? No, I don't think so. Yeah, you were at another garage sale we had. When was it, four months ago, last June? Oh, yes, that's right. How are you? -What's your name? -Marcia. -And you are? -Trudee. -Hi. -Hi. Candice, trudee came to our garage sale before. Oh, gee, which one? Wait a minute. I remember now. The... That man, he went into your house? Uh, yeah. One of the worst days of my life. You okay? How are you holding up? I'm all right. He could have killed you. I know. You could have lost everything. I appreciate that, trudee. You know, you're the first person to ask me what I went through that day. Hey, do you ever go to the saugus swap meet? Are you kidding? -I'd never miss it. -We should go. I would love the opportunity to learn from you. I mean, that is if you don't mind an amateur like me tagging along. Sure. ♪ we've got dreams ♪ ♪ we've got hope ♪ ♪ never sit around and mope ♪ ♪ got each other ♪ ♪ all we need ♪♪ I cannot believe how cheap everything was. Every time I go there, I have such a good time. Me too, I mean, look at all this stuff. That's...aw...i mean, look at this. How cute is this? Oh my gosh, yes, and this. -Right? -So vintage, 1970. The matching pair. -Aw, I can't. -So cute. Honey, look at all this stuff we got from the swap meet. Wow, more stuff. Yay. Honey, you see this? I bought it for five bucks. I can easily turn that around for 20. Are you kidding me? 40 at least. Hey, do you have any plans tonight? You wanna stay for dinner? Actually, I don't have plans, but I couldn't ask that of you. How much money did you spend on me today? I am cooking for you. I need to go to the ladies room. Will you pour trudee some of that iced tea, please? Ooh, iced tea sounds good. It was so hot out there. So, Candice, uh, your mom tells me you're quite the student journalist. What kind of stories are you working on? Look, I don't know who you are or why you're so interested in shopping with my mom all of a sudden, but I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't encourage her. Is Candice's father in the picture? I adopted Candice from a foster home when she was three years old. And you raised her all by yourself? Yep. Just me. And a lot of daycare. You never married? Uh, I came close once, but, um, no. How do you pay for all of this? I was a paralegal. I worked at a Beverly Hills law firm for about 20 years. They called it the evil empire. And then about six months ago, I just... I had enough, so... I quit. Never been happier. What about you? Is there anyone in your life? There was. Until this woman took him away from me. What happened? One day, he went to her house and... Suddenly I was all alone. I hate her. Well, don't forget, no one forced him into it. I mean, he has to take some of the blame as well, -doesn't he? -No. I blame her. Entirely. I'm sorry that happened to you. You don't deserve it. No, Marcia... I don't. Hey, honey, how was school? Awesome, we did a live three-camera broadcast today. Killed it. Good for you. What's going on? You sound bummed. I just got through balancing my checkbook for the last three months. And? I am officially out of money. No, you're not. You have my college fund. We're not touching that. Mom, don't be silly. That money's to send you to school, and I refuse to use it for anything else. Period. Are you gonna go back to work at the law firm? I called. They're downsizing. Everybody's downsizing. So, what are you gonna do? I was thinking about something completely different. What? Not another garage sale. Not a garage sale, a series of them. -Oh, no. -Like six in a row. -No! -Just on the weekends. -No! -Do you realize that every time we have a sale, we average $700 a day? I mean, that's enough to keep us afloat until I find a real job. Please? I really need your help. On one condition. Name it. That you don't buy anymore stuff to resell. This time, we clean out the house for good. No more garage sales after this. Well, can't I just have just... No. Those are my terms, mom. Take it... or leave it. You drive a hard bargain, kid. Deal. Hey, garage sale queen. Hi, trudee. How you been? Ah, it's been a rough couple of weeks. I've been callin' around tryin' to get a job, but... nobody's hiring, so I decided to do a couple more garage sales just to help pay the mortgage. Well, do you need some help? No, that's okay. Candice and I can handle it. No, please, I have time on the weekends, I'd love to help. That is, if you don't mind. Well, actually, I guess we could use the help. -Thanks, trudee. -Yeah. Hi, I have a question. Oh. Yeah, what's up? Hey, Candice! Hey, trudee. Another garage sale. Yep. Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something. Sure, what's up? Privately. It'll only take a minute. Come on. We're almost there. Go on. Get in. I want to change your mother's life. Permanently. Okay. I wanna give her a big surprise. You do? What? You know that back bedroom in your house that is just full of stuff? Well, I want to clean it up and turn it into an office for you guys. I brought cleaning supplies and everything. Oh, okay, that sounds great. I thought you might like that. And I know we got off on the wrong foot. So, I thought this might be a way for you and me to... You all right? Yeah, I was just worried for a second. About what? I thought you were gonna do something awful. Something awful? I thought you were gonna kidnap me? Really? Yeah, I thought you were gonna knock me out with those chemicals back there... Tie me up, take me to a cabin, -and... -Kill you? -Yes! -Why would I do that? I don't know. What an incredible imagination you have. -Really? -Yeah, I love your ideas. Score. One, two, three, open. Oh my goodness. Where did all the stuff go? Thank you so much, sweetie. It was Trudee's idea. Thank you, trudee. Hi, good morning. Oh, that will be eight dollars. -Eight dollars? -Yes. -Here's ten. -Out of ten. Here you go. Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Have a good one. Trudee, can you come... Do you mind? Hi. Anything special you're looking for? Uh, yeah, actually. Christmas items. Oh, I've got a bunch of Christmas stuff right over there. Yeah, let me show you. They're one of my favorite stations, actually. -Colors, wow. -I know, right? Wow, look at these, -these are great. -Thanks! -They were my mom's. -Oh. So, how much for all of it? Uh, well, the Christmas stuff. Okay, yeah, I know who you are, fella. -You do? -Yeah. You own one of those Christmas stores, don't you? You go around to all the garage sales and buy their ornaments, their reindeers, their snowmen, and then you sell them at your shop for ten times as much as you pay for them. I'm right, aren't I? No, that's not it at all. Uh-huh. No, the truth is I have a sister in Houston whose house recently flooded, and all the family Christmas decorations got ruined in the garage, so, my plan was to... Pack my car full of a bunch of Christmas stuff, drive out there, and surprise her and her kids with a real, old-fashioned... Classic Christmas. I know it's corny, but she's been through a lot. So, no, I do not own a Christmas store. Well, uh... My mistake. Uh, what do you do? Uh, nothing really. I'm retired. You're too young to be retired. Well, I used to work in silicon valley, and, uh, and I sold all my shares at just the right time... So now the few rental properties, you know, they keep me out of trouble. Oh. I'm Rick, by the way. Sorry, Rick Breedlove. Marcia, Marcia clattenburg. Nice to meet you. Hi. So, how much for the, uh... Christmas stuff, uh-huh. Um, uh, I don't know, maybe five, ten... How 'bout $300 for all of it? Uh... -Yes. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Great. -Oh, okay. -Yeah. Cash, that's great. Here you go. Oh, wow, thank you very much. No, thank you. Okay, well, I guess I'll put this stuff in my car. Let...let me help you. I actually... I have these guys. Here you go. I'll take that half, you take this half. Christmas reminds of when I was a kid. -Yeah? -You know? Do you have a lot of nieces and nephews out there with your sister? -Just two. -Who's the guy? I don't know. New friend of your mom's, I guess. Hm. He's kinda cute. My car's right over there. Yeah, I might have some more stuff in the attic probably. -Yeah? -In case you... In case you need anything else... -Oh, wow. -Okay. Your...your car is really clean. I'll just slide it right there. Great, there's so much room. And maybe put this down here. Um, uh, all right, well, guess that's everything. Well, thank you, Marcia. My sister will be quite happy. When do you leave? Uh, for Christmas in Houston? I was thinkin' maybe, uh, December. Great. That, uh... that makes sense. Mm-hm. Well, uh... Thanks for coming by. It's a pleasure meeting you. Yeah, me too. -Well, I... -Right. -Mm-hm. -Listen, can I ask you -a question? -Sure. Would you like to have dinner sometime? Yes, um, I'd love that. Okay, well, let me, uh... Oh, right, phones, right, phones. -Yeah. -We can text each other or what do we do? Did you pack a toothbrush? Yes, mother, and I found my sleeping bag under that pile of junk you keep in the den. It was miraculous. Please tell me Brittany's not gonna have any alcohol at this party. Of course not, her parents are going to be there. Now, would you hold still? I'm trying! I just haven't been on a date in so long. You'll do fine. Do you want my advice? Not really. Don't let him pick the movie. Girls choose. We're not going to the movies. We're going to a nice dinner. Ugh, boring. Oh, that's him. He's early. Panic, mayhem. Okay, um, just go downstairs and tell him that I'll be right down. -Okay. -Okay. Oh, god, uh... Hi, I'm Rick. You must be Candice. No, actually I'm Marcia, this is all Botox. Come on in. My mom will be down in a minute. You want something to drink? Water, iced tea? Water would be great, please. Your mom tells me you're quite the writer. She has incredible taste in literature. Yeah? Where do you think you'll go to college? Stanford or Berkeley. Wow, Stanford's pricey. I used to live up there. So you got a scholarship? Uh, my mom has saved up. Plus, I'll probably get some financial aid, I hope. So what do you think you'll major in, creative writing? Uh, broadcast journalism. I wanna have my own podcast, and someday, hopefully, my own network. Well, something tells me you'll be a huge success, Candice. Cheers. Hi, thanks for waiting. Hi, uh... You look great. Thanks. Okay, that's my cue. I'm gonna get out of here. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, honey. -Have fun. -Bye. Thank you. Rick, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Well, she's, uh, something else, huh? Yeah. She's going to a sleepover at her friend's house. A bunch of girls from her school will be there. Yeah, you told me. Right. I did, didn't I? You ready? Can only imagine how difficult it's been raising a daughter all by yourself. Toughest part's the mortgage, and the HOA, but I'm almost paid off, which is nice. Southern California real estate's usually a good bet, so you invested wisely. Coming from someone like you, that...that means a lot. Well, I hope you like seafood. I made reservations at the sandpiper. Oh, that place by the beach? Yeah, thought we could, you know, sit outside and listen to the ocean. I didn't bring my jacket. Well, they probably have outdoor heaters. Last time I went there, I almost froze. We need to go back to the house. I need to get my coat. Oh, I might have a sweatshirt in the backseat here. I'd prefer to wear something a bit more ladylike. If that's all right with you? We have time, don't we? Uh, sure. Are you okay? I thought I heard something. Yeah, I'm fine. Did you just come check on me? Yeah. An empty house at night. Burglars. You never know. That is... that's so sweet. Well, shall we? Thank you. Okay, um... It's, uh... It's been a long time. Same here. Come here. I guess we're not goin' to dinner. Nope. What was that? What? You didn't hear that? Who's there? Hey, hey, wait. I'll go, you stay here. Did you get it? What was it? I have bad news. -You have mice. -What? Yeah, I saw one climbin' on a big pile of stuff -that fell over. -Oh, no! Little guy ran off when he saw me. That's probably what the noise was. Candice is gonna kill me. Well, let me call an exterminator I know. He'll take care of it. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Not right now. -Not right now? -Again? -Mm-hm. -We should do this again. -Yeah, I'd like that. -Had a good time. -Me too. -Oh. -Honey! I thought you wouldn't be back till this afternoon. Yeah, the, uh, slumber party ended early, so... -Hi, Candice. -Hi, Rick. -I'll see you later? -Okay. Okay, all right. -See you. -Bye. You slept with him? Relax. You just met the guy! -So? -It was your first date! What, he takes you to a nice restaurant so you just jump in bed with him, just like that? We never made it to the restaurant. Oh my god! If I were to do that, you'd ground me for a year. It's different when you're my age. Oh, really? How? Talk to me in 20 years, I'll explain it to you. You barely know him! You don't know anything about him! I know he's a great guy, and... I really like him. Look, this might be hard for you to understand, but... imagine not having sex for... Eight years? I think I'm entitled. Whatever. Yeah, we're all done for the day. Gotta pack it all up. Thanks for coming, guys. How'd we do? Not great. $115 and change. Tomorrow will be better. We've got a bunch of furniture in the den we can unload. Mom... Use the college money. Please. This is crazy. I might have to, baby. Trudee, thanks again for all you're doing for us. My pleasure. -Take this inside. -Yeah. What the hell? What's the matter? Uh, nothing. Hi, yes, um, I have a question about a transaction that was done on march 7th. The transfer, right, I didn't do that. I don't care that it came from my ip address, whatever that is. I did not do that transfer. Can you tell me who it was transferred to? The name on the account? I'll need to talk to your supervisor. I'll call you back. Mom, what's going on? That's 39,500 for you... 39,500 for me, split right down the middle. To Peter. To Pete. There should've been more. Well, you said that's all she had in her account, so that's it, right, we're done. I'm not done. I want her house. Yeah, how you gonna get her house? You know how. The quitclaim thing. You said you used to do it all the time. That was a while ago, all right? Besides, you know how it works. You hit 'em once, you get out clean. You never hit 'em twice. -I'm hitting her twice. -Trudee, let it go. Let it go? Dad, she kills your son, and you're telling me to let it go. I'm not gonna let it go. I'm going to burn that woman. I'm going to take her house. I'm going to take over her life. I'm going to let her know what it feels like to lose everything. -It's not worth it. -It is to me! After you left home... After mom started tweaking... Pete took care of me. He protected me from her. I'm doing this. You with me or not? How much equity does Marcia have in her house? What we know is this: On the night of march 7th, apparently somebody got on your computer and made a wire transfer to a bank account belonging to a Richard Breedlove. He must've gotten up in the middle of the night when I was sleeping. Starting the following morning, for the next five days, whoever it was started making cash withdrawals until the account was liquidated. Now, we have a photograph of the person making the withdrawals, but as you can see, he managed to conceal his face pretty well. That's Rick! That's Rick Breedlove. No, it's somebody, but it's not Rick Breedlove. Rick Breedlove is a fictitious name. The account was entirely fraudulent. Are you saying there's no way to recover my money? I'm saying that the man in this photograph is a ghost. Okay, he's a con artist. We have no idea who he is or how to find him. So, yes, Ms. Clattenburg, I'm afraid that your money is gone for good. And in the future, I would suggest keeping your passwords in a secure lockbox and changing them frequently. Well, aren't you a lot of help? What do you expect us to do? I don't know, you're the cop. Do your job, I guess. I'm a homicide detective, ma'am. I don't usually handle cases of bank fraud. The only reason I'm here is to see if there's a connection to the man who fell down your stairs. Well, is there? At this point, we can't tell. Great. Thanks for your time. Look, if I find any more information, I'll reach out to you. It's my fault. What? No, it's not. I told Rick, or whatever his name is, that you had saved up money for my college. A lot of parents have college savings for their children, honey. That's not unusual. Yeah, but if I would've kept my mouth shut, he wouldn't have known about the account. You heard what the cop said. He was a con artist. He probably did his homework and knew the name of my first pet when I was a child. This is not your fault, all right? This is entirely on me. You were right. I should have never slept with him. I'll get a job. I can work for a couple years and I can save up, and I can put myself through school. Yeah, but... You shouldn't have to. I worked hard and saved for 18 years so that you could have the chance to go to the college of your dreams, and then I ruined it all by bringing that son of a bitch into our house. Mom, it's okay. I can't believe I did this to my baby. You don't deserve this. You work hard at school. You helped me with the garage sales, the other night you made me dinner. Find me one daughter that would do the same thing for her mother. And what do I do? I let this guy into our house, steal your whole future... -What about this? -No. -No? It's just two dollars. -I'm not interested. Okay, well, you said you love things from the '70s. I have a lot of things from the '70s right... You're leaving? Oh, well, thanks for coming. Marcia, may I have a word with you please? Evelyn, I know what you're gonna say... This is the fifth weekend in a row you've held this yard sale. I'm shutting it down. Folks, this sale is over. You can go home now. Please, please don't do this. You're running a commercial business in a residential zone. You worked at a law firm. You know exactly what you're doing. This is a cease and desist order from the HOA board. And this is a small fine in case you think we weren't serious. What? I can't afford this. You have 48 hours to clean all this up and make payment. If you fail to comply, we will fine you another three months, every month, until you do. Please, Evelyn, this is my only source of income. My bank account got hacked. I'm completely broke. I have nothing except for these garage sales. You had a good job, and you quit. Why? Because you didn't like it? Well, a lot of us have to do things we don't like to do. You have 48 hours. Thanks. That was worth $300. You're paying for that! Whoops. You bitch! You leave my mother alone, you hear me, or I swear to god, I'll kill you! Enough! Could you please not record this? Inside now. Good morning, detective. Did you find the guy? -The guy? -Who stole my money. Oh, no, this is about something else entirely. May we come in? Sure. Mind if my associates have a look around? Be my guest. Pretty much everything here is for sale, if you guys want anything. Marcia, where were you between the hours of 1 and 4 A.M.? I was here, at home, why? What about you, Candice? -Were you here too? -I was here. And were you both awake during that time? -No, we were sleeping. -If you were sleeping, Ms. Clattenburg, how can you be certain that your daughter was in the house with you? She could've left the house in the middle of the night and you wouldn't have known, right? Okay, you're starting to scare me. Why are you asking all these questions? Evelyn Rogers was found murdered in her home this morning. -What?! -Less than eight hours earlier, this video was recorded by one of your neighbors. That was...That was worth $300. You're paying for that! You bitch! Leave my mother alone, you hear me, or I'll kill you, I swear to god, I'll kill you! Stop it, enough. Could you please not record this? Am I a suspect? Candice, don't say anything. Ms. Rogers was stabbed multiple times with this pair of scissors. Now, we've managed to decipher a set of fingerprints on the murder weapon, and with your permission, I'd like to run both of your biometrics. -Mom, what the hell is going on? -Shh. We're not doing anything without a lawyer present. Look, this video alone is probable cause, which means that I can legally arrest you both, take you down to the station, and run your biometrics there, or we can do it here, right now, rule out a match. It's up to you. Okay, let's do it now. Place your index finger on the scanner. Middle finger. Ring. Pinkie. And thumb. All clear. Not a match. Candice. It's okay. What's taking so long? Slow Internet. We have a match. -What? -Candice clattenburg, you're under arrest for the murder of Evelyn Rogers. No, no, baby, baby, don't! No, no, let me go, let me go! -Hey, hey, hey! -Mom! You don't have to be so rough with her, all right? Don't say anything, okay? Just do exactly what they tell you, okay? -We'll figure this out. -If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Mom, please don't let them do this to me. I'll get you out, okay? -I will get you out, all right? -Do you understand the rights that I have just explained to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to us now? No, no, no. No. I know we're all friends, Marcia, and everyone at the firm is on your side, but we can't do this whole thing pro Bono. I know that. Mounting this defense is gonna cost you some money. -What kind of money? -Like... You-should-think-about-selling- your-house kind of money. Cream, sugar? -My daughter didn't kill her. -All right, then. Who did? We have to make a case that somebody else might've done this. Well... what about that Rick guy, or whatever his name is? What about him? He's a con artist. He's after fast money. Why would he kill the woman at your HOA? Look, Marcia, the Da is gonna throw everything at Candice. They've got motive, they've got her fingerprints on the murder weapon, and they found Evelyn's blood on your side gate and at the back door of your house. They're gonna say Candice grabbed the scissors from her bedroom, snuck out of the house, went over to Evelyn's, and stabbed her. And when she snuck back into the house, she left a blood trail. She's a straight-a student. She's the editor of her school news website. She's never been in trouble before, for anything! She threatened to murder the woman, on camera. So she had one outburst with the HOA lady. Does that mean she's a murderer? Neighbors say this isn't the first time she screamed at Evelyn Rogers. Candice has a temper. It's a part of who she is. Part of who she is? I didn't wanna be the one to tell you this, but as your lawyer, it's my job to be straight with you. They're gonna bring up the fact that Candice was a foster child and her birth parents were both trouble-makers. Her father died in prison serving time for manslaughter, and her mother was arrested for assaulting her heroin dealer. -I know all that. -They're gonna say that this type of violent behavior is in Candice's DNA. Do you believe it's in her DNA? Doesn't matter what I believe. It's about what we can prove. And right now, the proof is on their side. So basically you're saying we can't win this case. Before we even start it. It would be her first offense. She'll be eligible for parole in 25 years, maybe 20 if we're lucky. Lucky? -Hi. -Hi. I know what you're thinking, but I'm okay. The food in here is better than I expected. Um, so, what did the lawyer say? Well, they said that they were putting it all together, -and, um... -Don't candy-coat it. What did they say? I'm gonna fight this. What did they say? Said it doesn't look so good. Somebody framed me, mom. Who would do that? Why would anybody do that? I don't know, but I swear to you, I didn't kill her. Why are you looking at me that way? There's just so much evidence, Candice... You believe I did it? No, I didn't say that. -But you do. -No, I don't! I don't know how to explain this. I don't know what to say to defend you. You think I'm just like my parents, don't you? Please don't accuse me of that. I love you. Like I've never loved anybody. I'm gonna get you outta there. You should, uh, talk to Evelyn's neighbors and ask them if they saw anything the night she was murdered. What? That's exactly what my baby girl would do. You're the news reporter of the family. And you're so brave. I gotta figure out a way to pay for these lawyers. I'm gonna... I'm gonna clean up the house and we're gonna sell it. While you're at it, can you sell all the junk that's inside the house? I miss you. You can't sell the house in this condition. I know. -I need to... -You need to get rid of all this stuff. Sell it, throw it away, whatever. It's gonna take some time. I need to go through everything. Okay, then how much time do you need? Like... Two months? The only problem is I don't have any money to pay for the mortgage for the next two months. What if I paid your mortgage for the next two months? Oh, trudee, I can't ask you to do that. You're not asking. I'm offering. Are you serious? Why would you want to do that? I'm in the process of moving out of my place anyway. I could stay here for a couple of months, till you get back on your feet. Is that okay? Sure. Here's for this month. That should cover the mortgage and the utilities. I'm gonna pay you back. Let's just get this place cleaned up and ready to sell. What are you doing?! Trudee, what... What are you doing? I thought I'd get rid of a few things. You can't just throw those away! This is worth $30! And this was my uncle's when he was in Vietnam. -I... -Marcia, Marcia, you don't need these things. Yes, I do. Do you need them or do you want them? Throw them away. -I can't. -You can do it. Good! More. Good. Now all of it. No, no, not Isabella. I can't! She was my mother's. She was mine when I was a child, and now she belongs to Candice. I can't throw her away! You need to clean up this house and sell it so you can pay those lawyers. Candice doesn't need a baby doll anymore. She needs her mother to mount a good defense. Missed a spot. Where? There. Here? That's, uh... It's a stain from the, uh... From the what? -It's from the... -From the day you killed that guy who came into your house? I didn't kill him. He fell. Oh, right. I thought you pushed him. My mistake. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I remember now. That man, he went into your house. Is there anyone in your life? There was... Until this woman took him away from me. One day, he went to her house and... suddenly I was all alone. I hate her. I blame her entirely. I didn't kill him. He fell. Oh, right. I thought you pushed him. I thought you pushed him. I thought you pushed him. These are a little runny. I usually like them a little more well-done. -Sorry. -That's okay, now you know. Oh, hey, I, uh, found this new floor cleaner online. It says it removes blood stains from hardwood. Hmm, that's good. What you said yesterday got me thinking. What did I say? That you thought I pushed him. I never told anybody this, but... You know how they say that... time slows down when you're in a life-and-death situation? Yeah. There was a... split second when his feet started slipping on the necklace that I thought, "this guy's gonna fall. Should I catch him?" And the truth is, I didn't really... try to catch him. I could've, but instead I just... Let him go. -You know? -Mm-hmm. Frankly, I'm glad he fell. I am glad he snapped his neck. I mean, the guy comes into my house, goes right into my bedroom, robs me. I mean, he could've raped me, or Candice. He could've killed us both. You never know with these scumbags. He deserved to die, don't you think? I mean, don't you think so, trudee? That he had it coming? Excuse me. I wanna do this now, I wanna do this tonight. She's pissing me off, I'm sick of her! When can you meet? What do you mean you want to talk first? All right, fine. You wanna talk in person, we can do that. Meet me at my place. I'm on my way there now. Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on. -So what's wrong with our deal? -It's not fair. -How is it not fair? -I'm the one taking the risk. You're taking the risk? What about me? Well, I'm the one who made the fake ids and got the money out of the banks. I could've been busted every time I walked in. Yeah, but you weren't, because I cased 'em out ahead of time. I planned it all out! I told you where the cameras were. What about the HOA lady, was that part of the plan, huh? You didn't have to chop her up. The daughter's in jail, isn't she? -It was perfect. -No, it was sloppy. You know, if you really wanted to have a say in how I run my operation, then you should've been around a little more often. And what's that supposed to mean? It means you took off, dad, for years, and when you do that, you forfeit your right to tell me how to run my life. I'm not telling you how to run your life. -Sure sounds like it. -All I'm saying is that you got a little cocky and you pushed things too far. You want to be a success in this business? You don't go leaving dead bodies all over the place! Who says? What, is there some rulebook in some library somewhere with all kinds of helpful hints on how to do this kind of thing? It's common sense, trudee. Don't be a frickin' moron! Are you trying to blow this, huh? -Do you want to end up in jail? -No. What is it, amateur hour? I taught you better than that. And it wasn't part of our deal. Yo! Our deal? Sorry, but this was my gig from the get-go. I just brought you in on this, dad, and you know it. I want 70 percent. -You're crazy. -Well, you can't get her house without my help and you know it, so why don't you call me when you get a clue, huh? You don't have to get all sensitive on me. -No! -No, no, no. Damn it, she heard. She not only heard it, she probably recorded it. Bitch. We have to do this now. 50/50. Fine. -You bring the papers? -In my bag. Hey, stop it! Stop it. You're gonna sign your house over to me, your favorite roommate. You're not gonna get away with this. You need a notary. He's a notary. He'll make sure it's all legal. My day job. -Now sign it. -Go to hell. Sign it, we let you go. All right, I did it, now let me go. -Tie her up. -Let me go! -Tie her up! -No. No, no, no. No, no, no. Help! Help! What are you doing? What are you doing? We're gonna cut her up into little pieces and flush it down the toilet. It's gonna look like she had a nervous breakdown and disappeared. With her daughter in jail, she couldn't handle the pressure, so she signed her house over to her good friend trudee and took off. No, we're done with her, all right? We're not gonna kill her. Yes, we are. She'll talk. No, she won't talk because we're gonna keep her locked up until the house gets liquidated and we get the cash. Then we split town. By that time, it won't matter what she says to anybody. Okay, we already planned this. Listen to me. We do not have to kill her. We kill her if I say so. How did you... Live stream. Candice taught me. Everyone was watching, trudee. It's over. Hey, guys, big shout-out to those of you who watched my mom's livestream broadcast and called the cops. Thank you. And get this: Because of what my mom captured on video, they let me out of jail! The cops arrested trudee and her dad, and it looks like they'll be both going away for a very, very long time. -We did it. -You did it. Real good news is that my mom got the house cleaned up all by herself. Can you believe it? I mean, look at this place! I think she's finally beat the clutter-bug disease. And from this moment forward, mom and I are going full-on feng shui and we're gonna bring a ton of positive energy into our lives. So, that's all the good news for now. This is Candice clattenburg reporting live from... Home. Got something for you. What? Oh my god, you rescued Isabella? There's no way I was letting her go. Oh my god, thank you, mom. We should celebrate. What do you wanna do? Wanna go to the swap meet? No!
