(Brittany moaning) (upbeat rock music) (Rachel clears throat) - Thanks a lot. - Good job, Rachel. That's the second time this week. How am I supposed to keep a boyfriend? - Don't worry. It'll never happen again. I'm out of here. - Oh, no you don't. You're not going anywhere. Remember, we split the rent. Without your third, Megan and I may have to go live in a dorm. Just the thought of that makes me sick. - Too bad. Not my problem anymore. You two shouldn't even be in school. You never go to class; all you do is party and bring men here. Oh, I can't study. I never have a moment's peace. If Megan's father knew about this, he'd have a fit. I could tell, you know. - Just because you're mad at me, don't get Megan into trouble. Just wait here. We'll talk about it. She'll be back from the library. - I'm not staying here another minute. (solemn music) - Oh, come on, guys. I was just minding my own business. - Victor wants his money. - I know that. I was just on my way to work on that. But he said I had five days. Look, guys, they're just my books. That's all. That's all. Please, just give it back. Please? - You better not forget. He wants his money. - Okay. Okay. (Hardy laughing) (smooth rock music) - Come on, put the books away. - I'm supposed to be at a library. I've been missing too many classes, I have a ton of makeup work. - What are you worried about? It's not going anywhere. - Try to understand. My father is very strict. He's paying for my school and he expects good grades. - Forget your father. Forget the books. (smooth rock music continues) (Megan moaning) - What's your hurry? - I got plans. You said you had to study, so I didn't think you'd be here this long. - Well, you're the reason I'm not studying. What is this? Wham, bam, get out? - Look, sorry, Megan. You know I see other people. Brenda will be here any minute. - What do you mean you see other people? Who's Brenda? - Come on, this is college, everyone sees other people. - Oh, well, you won't be seeing me anymore. We're finished. (door slams) (upbeat music) - Tom. - Clancy, You know I'm always glad to see you, man, but here? This is kind of embarrassing. What if somebody sees me with you, man? Look at you, Clancy. You look so uptight. When's the last time you got some sun, man? - I'm not even going to pay attention to those insults you just handed me. I embarrass you? Look, it's important. I'm in trouble, and I need your help. - What are you, late with a term paper or something? I can't really help you with that, Clancy. - No, no. You don't understand. It's big trouble. - You don't know what trouble is. - Tom. - Okay, what is it? - I owe Victor Belbina being a five grand. - You what? - You heard me. Please don't make me say it again. - Dude. - I feel sick. - All right, look, we'll figure something out. Let's just go get a beer and you can tell me all about it. You're buying, right? - What did I miss? - We need another roommate ASAP. - Oh, great. What else could go wrong today? I told you to be nice to her. She's a friend of my family. What did you do? - It's not me, it's her. I didn't do anything. She's a prude. She said she couldn't study here. Imagine that? - Well, I hope she doesn't tell my father. That's the last thing that I need. (smooth rock music) - I've just decided to go back to school, and I really don't want to live in a sorority, so I've decided this is the sort of thing that I'd like to move into. - I love parties. This would be, like, the great party house. Folly, Candace and Bernita and Hans will just have a blast. - I love this place. I like the hardwood floors. I love peach walls. I like it. I'd take it. How much? What do you think? - As long as I can park my bike in my room, I'll take it. - Ooh, I wouldn't want to meet her in a dark alley. - So, we still have a big problem; no roommate and I'm sure no one else is going to show up today, it's after 5:00. (light knocking) Here we go again. Come on in. It's open. - Great. You guys are normal looking. I mean, I'm sorry, it's just you would not believe what I've seen. - Oh, yes, we would believe. When can you move in? - [Receptionist] Hollingsworth Industries. - Yes. Mr. Hollingsworth please. - [Receptionist] Who may I say is calling? - Rachel. Rachel Katz. It's a personal matter. - [Receptionist] Hold one moment, please. (phone ringing) - Winston Hollingsworth. How may I help you? - Mr. Hollingsworth, it's Rachel Katz. I would never disturb you at work, but I feel it's my duty to tell you that I'm no longer living with Megan, and the terrible things that are happening. (rock music) - Look, let me do the talking, okay? - You sure she lives here? - Yeah. Her mom said she moved in yesterday with a couple of girls. College girls. Bet they're geeks. Sorry, Clancy. - Right. Let's go. I've only got five more days. Thank you. (light knocking) - What's that? (loud knocking) - I'll get it. - I'm looking for Heather. - Oh, yeah. Heather's here. Come on in. - Out. Get out. Whatever kind of trouble you're in, I don't want to know about it. - Look, Heather, you don't understand- - Hey look, it doesn't matter. This time I'm not helping you. I mean, you quit school, you don't go to work, you're just a beach bum. Now, if it was Clancy, it'd be a different thing. He's responsible. He doesn't get into trouble. - Heather, it is me. - Come on, when are you going to stop covering for him? - I wish I was. It was kind of like a scientific experiment. I mean, I thought I had a surefire formula for a seven card stud. - Seven card stud? You? - Come on. Go on. - Well, I set up a game with Victor Belbina; needless to say, my theory didn't work out, and I lost. So when they wanted their money, I tried to explain to them it was just an experiment, but they didn't buy it. And they said that if I didn't come up with the money, they were really going to hurt me bad. - Okay. I have a little saved. How about you guy? - Yeah, sure, Clancy. You can just pay us back. - You don't understand; I'm talking about a lot of money. - Clancy, I'm sure you're good for it. How much is a lot? - I owe $5,000. - You owe what? $5,000? God, I'm sorry, Clancy, but I don't know where we'd come up with money like that. - Tom has an idea. (upbeat music) - It's simple; we'll fix the place up and throw a one night bash. - Well, it's not much, but it's my only hope. When I inherited it I didn't know what to do with it. It hasn't been opened in 10 years. I was just holding onto it to sell it at the right time. - Okay, then, sell it now and you're problem's solved. - Brittany, don't you get it? He doesn't have time to sell. It takes more than five days to sell property. - Okay, so what do we do? What do we do? - Something that'll really attract a crowd. We'll charge $20 a head. We'll, really raking the bucks. Problem solved. - I don't know if it's that easy. I mean, who'd come here? This place looks like a dump. - We need some sort of hook. - What kind of hook? - I don't know. I don't know. Maybe a giveaway. Or maybe a contest. - Yeah, yeah, like a dance contest. - Yeah, that's it! A dance contest. - No, no, no. Not a dance contest, something more. I don't know, something more- - Hey, I've got it. How about a boob contest? - [Heather] A what? - A wet T-shirt contest. - That's an idea. - I don't know. Maybe if we gave away prizes or something. - I got a prize. Date with super stud. - God, even if you weren't my cousin, I would still tell you the same thing; you start thinking with your big head. - Well, you know, this just might work. If we can get enough pretty girls to sign up. - [Brittany] I'll be the first one to sign up. - Okay, great. Paint and tools are in the back, so let's get started. We got a deadline, right? (Megan groans) (light music) - Just one more minute. There's one more spot. - No problem. Take your time. - So. Tell me about Tom. - I've should've known it. - What? What did I say? - Tom has all the girls. They swarm around him all the time. He has all the luck. - Well, he is attractive. But frankly, I'm not sure he's my type. - What do you mean he's not your type? If he asked you out, would you say no? - Well, I didn't say that. (indistinct) - This place is so cool. This stage is perfect. - Hey, look at this. It's ancient. (upbeat music) No way. It works! (upbeat music continues) What are you doing? Come on, quit fooling around, we have work to do. - Work, work, work. I just want to have fun. You know, I think I was a stripper in a previous life. - Encore! Encore! (Tom clapping) - Show's over. Get lost. - Hey, Tom. I do give private performances, you know. - You're not the only one. I think Megan has the hots for him too. - Megan? Forget it, she's too nice for him. Look at him. He needs a wild woman, and you're looking at her. (upbeat music) - Any guys we see, we stop. We get them to go. Any girls, we sign up to be in the contest. Got it? (rock music) - It's going to be great. You guys going to be there? - Are you going to be in the contest? - I will be for sure. - Sold me. We'll be there. - Good. - Don't forget to tell your friends. (hammer clanging) (upbeat music) - Hey guys, stop it! Get away from the ladder! What are you trying to do? Kill me? - Hey, Harry, this nervous stick I got in my arm. - Must run the family. I got the same thing. (both laughing) - It wouldn't hurt much to fall from there. I mean, unless you broke your neck or something. - Let's try. See what happens. (ladder clattering) - I thought you wanted to collect your money. - What's it to you, hero? - You mess him up now, you stand no chance of collecting. Tell you what, how about I make it easy for you? I'll go call Victor and tell him would've collected his money, but his two thugs decided to have a face smashing party instead. - Listen, wise-ass, we were only giving him a friendly reminder. We're leaving now. We'll be back, wise-ass. - Clancy, you can come down now. - Will you hold the ladder? (soft music) (camera clicking) - Where is everybody? - They were exhausted. We've been at the beach all day. - How'd it go? - Great. I think we're going to be able to pull this off. - Listen, I wanted to thank you and Megan for helping us out. I mean, Heather, she's family. - You want to return favor? - What'd you have in mind? (romantic music) - I like your cousins. - Clancy's great. Tom means well, but he has a huge ego. - Well, maybe he's just misunderstood. - Don't be fooled by his good looks, Megan. Tom changes women faster than changes his underwear. - Why is it so hard to find a good man? - You? I thought you and Brittany were having a contest to see how many notches you guys could put in your lipstick. - Brittney, yes, but me, it's really more of a front to bother my father. He's so overprotective he drives me nuts. - Right, so all you're looking for is a really nice guy to settle down with? Ha-ha. - I'm serious. Where is Britney anyway? - I don't know, but I think she might be with Tom. - Was that Brittany I just saw leaving? - Yeah. - Oh, man, you get all the girls. It's not fair. - Your time will come. Don't worry about it. - You think so? - Yeah. - Hey! Turn that off! - What's with you? Drowning your sorrows? You don't even drink, or have you forgotten? - Where were you. - With Tom. Don't ask for details. What a stud. Early bird gets the worm. No pun intended. All's fair in love and war, right? - One of these days, when a good one comes along, I'm going to get them first. - Not a chance. (door slams) - I can't go with you guys. I'm missing too many classes. - Oh, come on, you guys, this is really important. We just got a couple more days. - She'll do it. Megan's always worried. But she only goes to class 50% of the time and passes anyway. She's got down to a science. Come on. (mischievous music) - Okay, they're gone. Let's do this fast. - Look, you are just along for the ride. I do not want to add breaking and entering to my problems. You just stay out of the way. You have the key? - Of course, I've got the key. I'm not an idiot, you know. - Right. - Clancy, where are you? Clancy? - Hey guys. What do you think? - Wow. This is going to work. Looks really great. - Well, save your applause for opening night. We still got to make sure people come. Oh man, my aching neck and my back. - Oh, let me help you with that. Poor baby. - Come on, let's get the flyers and go. Time's a-wasting. - [Megan] Clancy, where's Tom? - He's sleeping out back. You should go get him. - Hurry up! Aren't you finished yet? - Shut up. I'll be right there. (sly synth music) - Come on. What took you so long? - Enough. Let's go. - Come on, sleepy head. Wake up. - Hi. - Everyone's waiting for you. - I'll be right out. - Okay. (soft tropical music) - [Clancy] Tom! Tom! Come on, we got to go, man. Tom! - Yeah. Be right there. (Tom chuckles) - You are going to love this one, Winston. - Hey, we should split up today and cover more ground. Brittany. Let's go. - All right. - All right. - Thanks, Tom. (upbeat music) - Hi. - Hi. - There's a $200 prize for the winner. - Wow. Who's going to be the judge? - Well, it's audience response, of course, but, well, I oversee everything though. Here you go. I got to go. Be there. - There he is! Get out the way! (Clancy yelling) (synth music) ♪ Every woman has a fantasy ♪ ♪ And I know it's true ♪ ♪ I got some sweet dreams on my mind ♪ ♪ About me and you ♪ ♪ It's a fantasy ♪ (Clancy yelling) Boy, you guys are going to get it! - Wait a minute, I've got to go. I'll see you there. - Shut up before you really get hurt. - Put him down! - Who are you, sweetheart? (Hardy groans) - Hey! Hey, take it easy. What is he, your boyfriend or something? - As a matter of fact, he is. Come here, honey. - Now I've seen everything. Make sure lover boy here coughs up Victor's dough. - Go on, get out of here, you'll get your money. (both laughing) - Clancy. Clancy. - Boy, somebody's got you working pretty hard. - What? I didn't hear you. - I saw you out here the other day. You're working pretty hard, aren't you? - Yeah. It's a long story. So you going to go? - Sure. But I need a date. - You need a date? Right. - Well, kind of new here and I haven't met many people yet. Will you go with me? - But I don't know you. - True, so have dinner with me tonight, and that way you can officially say you know me and accept the date. Deal? Come on. Just dinner. - Okay. Dinner. - Great. My name's Calvin. - I'm Heather. - Nice to meet you. (soft music) - Thanks. I'm so thirsty. - How's it going? - Good. I was just about to head back. - Let's finish our sodas first and I'll walk back with you. So what are you studying in school? - Generals right now. I wouldn't even be in school if it went for my dad. I wanted to take a year off and decide what I wanted to do. - You two don't get along? - Oh, I love him. It's just that he's always on me about being too irresponsible. I guess I usually prove him right though. What about you? - Same story. Did school a while ago. Beginning to wonder if it might have been a mistake. - What do you mean, a mistake? According to Clancy, you have it made. Hanging out at the beach all day. - Yeah, well, someday the beach won't be enough, you know? - We better head back. - You think maybe you and I could get together sometime? - What about Britney? - Brittney. Brittney. That's nothing. Well, it used to be something, but it's nothing anymore. - I realized I had a knack for investigating and been a private investigator ever since. So, now you know my life story, just a regular guy. - Well, I've never met a private investigator before. I think it sounds very exciting. - It can be. It does get boring sometimes. - So, do you consider yourself to be a (indistinct)? - What do you mean? - Like us. We sort of just met by chance and we seem to have so much in common. - Well, I must admit, I am surprised at how well we get along. - Why? - Cause you're younger and still in school. Did I say pleasantly surprised? (jazzy music) - Well, someone's having fun. I can't go in. - Why not? - The bow. It's our signal. Do not disturb. - You're kidding me. People really do that? - Well, I can't complain. It was my idea. - Would you mind if I waited here with you? - I'd love the company. But you don't have to. - No, no. I don't mind. I got nowhere else to go. (jazzy music continues) - Do you have a girlfriend, Clancy? - Not really. It seems to be a subject that I haven't mastered. - I could give you some pointers. - Yeah? Like what? - Well, first of all, let's take off your glasses. (jazzy music) - I can't see anything. - See, Clancy, you're a good looking guy. You just need to change your style a little bit. Take a look. - Don't tease me. - I wouldn't tease you. You look great. - Wow. My hair really does look better this way. - Don't go away, I'll be right back. - I'll be right here. (jazzy music) - Hi. - Hey. - Do you always go through other people's things? - Why don't you just get out of here, you son of a bitch. This is what I was worth to you, huh? Huh? $1,000 check from Megan's father so you can get some information. God, you're a whore. You are nothing but a whore. - Heather, it's not what it seems, all right? Yes, I took the job from Winston, but that was before I met you. I was going to tell you. That was before I got involved with you. I didn't know I was going to get involved. I didn't want to complicate things. - Okay, so when were you going to tell me, huh? When the job was finished? Just get out of here! I never want to see your face again. You got it? - You want to tell us what happened? - Please, don't blame me. It's not my fault. - Blame you? What are you talking about? - Calvin. I met him at the beach today. He seemed really nice. I found out tonight that he is a detective working for Megan's father. - Oh, well, there must be some kind of mistake. My father would never hire a private detective. He sinks low, but never that low. - God, I'm sorry, Megan, but there's no mistake. I saw the check myself. - Why'd you let him get away? We could have taken care of that jerk real good. - Oh, forget him, he's only hired help. It's my father that's the real jerk. - What are you going to do? - What can she do? Nothing. Just forget it. - Tom's right. What can I do if I confront my father? It will only make things worse. Besides, tomorrow night's the big night. I'll deal with my father later. We can't have anything go wrong. - God, I can't believe I was taken in by him. I mean, he seemed so nice. - Happens to the best of us. - Sir, excuse me, sir, what's happening? What's with the red tape? - You the owner? - Yes, sir. I got the papers inside if you need to see them. Is there a problem? - I don't need to see them, that's not the problem. According to this flyer, there's a club opening tonight. - I know. It's very important. - Afraid it's not going to happen. No business license or city permit is in place for this building. - A license? A permit? Okay, it's not a problem., we'll get one. Where do I go? $1,200? Where am I going to get $1,200? - Sorry, kid. And no funny stuff. If you don't have the permit, this seal stays in place. You got it? We'll be watching. - What are we going to do when all those people show up tonight? - God, what if it turns into a riot or something? - I just suggest we just forget the whole thing, guys. - Wait, look, don't panic. We got bigger problems than the club. What about Victor? He's not going to forget his money. - There has to be something that we can do. - Oh, no. What now? - You want me to take care of him? - Wait a minute. Let me see what he wants. - Hi. Can I speak to you a minute? Alone? - Listen, whatever you have to say to her, say it here. She doesn't want to see you alone. - Okay. - What's this? - It's all the photographs and information for Winston Hollingsworth. I quit. - So what? Is that supposed to make everything okay? - It's my apology. And I'd like it if you could accept it. If you can't, I'll live with it. I just wanted to warn you. - Warn us? About what? - Well, your father's not very happy that I quit, and I don't exactly know what he plans to do. - Well, we have bigger problems than that. - What happened? Aren't you guys still having your bash tonight? - No. They shut us down. We don't have a permit and it costs $1,200 for one. - Don't tell him our problem's, Clancy. He doesn't care. - Look, don't give up. You guys will have a good turnout. Something will work out. - You were a little hard on him, don't you think? - I had to be. I could really fall for this guy, and I don't want to get hurt again. - You've got to take some chances. - Easy for you to say. - Look, guys, we're getting nowhere fast. I'm going to go down to the permanent office and see if we can't work something out. - Forget it, it's just a waste of time. - With an attitude like that, I should have left you at Victor's doorstep. - I'm sorry, Tom. Go ahead and see what you can do. Would you want me to go with you? - Just stay here with the girls. Guys, just work on the decorations. Stick with the plan. (jazzy music) - God, I hope that's not the cops. On second thought, cops sound pretty good about now. You guys stay here. I'll take care of this. I've got until tomorrow. What are you guys doing here? - Victor heard you have problems. If you can't open, you can't pay. - Yeah. Might as well bust your face right now. Why wait? - Tom's getting the permit, there's no problem. I'll deliver tomorrow. Fair's fair, right, guys? - Fine. But I'll be back tonight. - Why tonight? - Just protecting Victor's interest. You got a problem with that? - No. No. I just was- - Let's get out of here, Hardy. Just looking at this wimp, making me nauseous. (jazzy music) - I have a friend that lives on a hippie commune near Boston. I could give her a call. Maybe you could stay there for a while. - Hippies? Might work. Sorry, guys, they wouldn't budge. - Won't be needing these anymore. - Not so fast. I got the permit. - Where'd you get the money? - Megan's father. I'd like to help tonight. What do you say? Heather? Will you forgive me? - Heather, come on. Take the paper. - Thanks for helping us. (all cheering) - Okay guys, let's get the streamers up and let's check out this poster. All right. - I'm not going to die after all. (upbeat music) - We're here for the contest. - What did we do? - Hold on and I'll help you guys real quick. - Clancy, I'll handle this. Come on, girls, I'll show you where you can change. (upbeat music) - Hey, Brittany. - Hi. This is Lynette and Monica. - Hi. - How are you? (upbeat music continues) - Well? What do you think? - I've got work to do. - No, silly. My outfit. Do you think I'll win? - It's fine, I guess. Shirt's going to be wet, right? - Well, that's the idea. Here, get a better look. - Brittany, put the shirt back on. - What? You don't like what you see? - Yes, of course. You're gorgeous. But I'm not interested. - You were interested the other day. It's Megan, isn't it? Megan, we were just- - Megan, it's not what you think it is. - It's okay. I was just looking for a screwdriver. - Thanks, Brittany. Thanks a lot. (upbeat music) - Oh, joy. I missed you so much. - Just shut up. Keep collecting. Hey. Check it out. Nice. I bet you a C note she wins. - Are you crazy? My life is in your hands and you want me to bet more? You're a very sick man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (upbeat music continues) - It's looking good, huh? - Yeah, the crowd's getting kind of antsy though, you better go check on the girls. - Yeah. Okay. See you later. (women chattering) It's a mad house in here. Are you sure we should let these girls loose? - Oh, they're just having a good time. You know about that. - Megan, I was just telling Brittany that I didn't want to see her anymore. - What? I can't hear you. - I was telling her I didn't want to see her anymore. - What? - I think I love you. (all applauding) Okay, are you ready for the hottest, wildest, the wettest wet T-shirt contest ever? (crowd cheering) All right, let's bring out contestant number one! (party music) (crowd cheering) Contestant number two! (party music) (crowd cheering) Contestant number three! (party music) (crowd cheering) Contestant number four! (party music) (crowd cheering) - We're almost there. I told you I'd take the money. - You got lucky. Too bad, me and my brother was kind of looking forward to teaching you a lesson. - What are you waiting for? His money's green just like everyone else. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Ready? Good luck. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) Good luck. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - This is what you do? I send you to school, and this is the way you pay me back? - It's not what you think. I'm not going to discuss it right now. Give me a chance to explain, but later, after the contest. - No, let's talk about it now. - I know about the private detective. You owe me. So please, sit down and wait for me. - Hear that? They're dying out. I'm going to win this no matter what. - Impossible. I'm going to win. Sorry. - Yeah? Watch this. (smooth rock music) (crowd cheering) - You're insane. I'm not going to give you this money. It goes to Victor, and it's going to be personally delivered by me. (smooth rock music) (crowd cheering) - Look, you little shit, Victor sent me to collect it. What do you think I've been doing? What do you think, I'm your doorman or something? Give me the money or I break your face. - Not until the contest is over. - The final moment you guys have been waiting for. We're going to bring the girls out, we're going to line them up. And remember, your applause picks the winner. All right. Contestant number one is Debbie! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Contestant number two is Tina! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Contestant number three is Ginger! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) Oh, this is going to be difficult. Number four is Monica! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) Contestant number five is Lynette! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) And now for our final contestant, the beautiful Brittany! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Uh-oh. Hope we don't have a problem. - I see what you mean. I didn't even even think about crowd control. (all gasp) - Come on. I know you're having a good time. Let's just go off the stage and nobody gets hurt. Come on. (loud punch) (upbeat music) - What a nerd. Jesus. I've got you now. Give me that money. (loud thud) (Hardy grunts) Get off me! Help! - You're not going anywhere, pal. - Clancy? - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Sit down, guys. It's okay, everything's taken care of. Dude! - You all right? Good job. - Come on, Hardy, you're out of here too. Let's go. Come on. Get up! Get out of here. Okay, guys, okay. Let's pick the winner, and may the best pair win. Ladies. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) And our winner is the beautiful Brittany! (crowd applauding) - I meant what I said. What's wrong? You look upset. - My father's here. I have to go talk to him. - You want me to go with you? - No. Just give me a minute. I have to handle this myself. - Okay. - Thanks a lot, guys. Drive safely. See ya. - Come on. Let's go. - Go? Wait a second, what about helping them clean up? - Tomorrow. - Yeah? - I've got some other plans for us tonight. - Uh-oh. - Can I explain? Please, let me explain everything first. Well, it all started when Rachel moved out. Remember when I called you and I told you that we lost our roommate? - So how'd we do? - We did great. I can't believe this. We have enough money here to pay Victor and then some. - Cool. - What's this? - It's the prize Money. You want it, right? No, no, no. Keep it. I'm going to split the rest of the profits with everyone. What? Tell me, I have something on my face. My fly's undone. - You were so brave, Clancy. - Oh, that? That was nothing. - You showed me a whole different side of you. - Really? You think so? - So, what are you going to do after this? - Well, I'll probably take the money back to Victor and I guess come back here and clean up. - Well, I could go pay Victor with you, and then, well, we'll see. - You'd want to go out with me? - Clancy, just say yes and let's go. - Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. - Is everything okay? - Believe it or not, I think he's actually proud of me. - He should be. - Well, after I told him about Clancy and he realized we were helping someone, he said it was probably the most responsible thing I've ever done. - Let me take you home. (romantic music) - Coffee's ready. - You're looking at my college catalog. - Yeah. I'm thinking about joining you. Look at the success we had last night. A couple of business courses, there's no stopping us.
