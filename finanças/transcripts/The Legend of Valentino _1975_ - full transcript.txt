to test count rudolfo de valentino if it turned out okay jake was going to build our boy up as the greatest lover since casanova if it didn't rudy had nothing to worry about jake would help him get deported hey count ready to roll drag it out here just do it the way you did it rehearsal and you'll be fine i wish i was dead good then you'll be too frightened to ham it up now be nice to your dancing partner she is very friendly with the casting director well here he is you've got to give me more see the camera doesn't hear you it only sees you when you get angry at laura you've got to be three times as angry as real life i don't think so you don't think so what people are not so stupid it shouldn't be more than real that's a mistake in oh well all films a lot of sense now you'll do it my way or you're out on your royal rear end capisce but i was only lost i need this job i still think you're down to okay now laura rodolfo let me see you really get angry this time roll it action let's have to move say something romantic i'd like to throw up you're trembling you're actually traveling you wouldn't understand it means sometimes i sleep with the casting director okay now let's see you get angry no you're lying don't call me a liar you stupid jackass build it up give me more hit me knock her down you're supposed to knock her down you want the job knock me down that's my own shirt damn you all teared on you you're right well what do you think laurel lorraine for the girl i like fine good but not for the dancer for the nice the italian looks italian house i don't care if he's supposed to be a count or a marquee the american women won't go for sam i remember you turned down douglas fairbanks i was right wait you'll see what do you think photographs like a foreigner and foreigners have to play heavies american women won't trust them they trust american men they marry them don't they who's talking about marriage i'm talking about sex sam this is 1920. and we've just been through a world war women are wearing one-piece bathing suits they're drinking bathtub gin they're dancing the black bottom not with me and the only thing that hasn't changed is the screen i mean we are still pretending that sex was invented by rebecca of sunnybrook farm now why can't we be closer to reality i mean every housewife has slept with a man even if it's only her husband because movies aren't real people go to the movies because they want a dream what are you dreaming about sam indians i dream about if this picture doesn't get started soon i'm going to go broke and then you wrote the scene all wrong the hero shouldn't hit a woman they'll hate him sam you ever hit your wife how could i it's how money well maybe you should i mean women are bored they're restless they're tired of being protected and american men are dull i mean if we're gonna buy a dream we're gonna buy the one about the handsome foreigner who drags us into his bed against our will you'd like that oh i'd love that sam and so would your wife no she wouldn't she tell him she's got a headache i'm beginning to buy it hmm half villain half hero it's fresher than the old american boy well that's why i wanted to do this script i mean that's one of the things the four horsemen is about for your information i'll tell you what the four horsemen is about it's about war conquest pestilence and death every one of them box office it is also about sex sam and the effect that the war has had on women's attitudes toward now sex can be the biggest box office of all is the boy any good he photographs well also he moves well i must say surprise me and he comes off a lot better on the screen than he did on the set i'm with jun now he's worth the gamble okay i made a decision good i'll ask my wife sam while we waited for the producer's wife to make up her mind jake got his royal client invited to all the important hollywood parties loaned him his best suit to wear and rented the most expensive foreign car in town for him to drive i think it was the first time rudy had driven anything that didn't nay one thing to be said in favor of bootleg gin it really got a party going this happy couple didn't find out till it was too late that they were already married to each other oh jake you want a drink listen if the cops come pull the plug how many is rudy at who's counting look at him he drank

you're each getting 10 bucks so oh we were witnessing the unreasoning unfathomable force that finds a gallagher for every generation rudolph valentino had become suddenly bewilderingly the first symbol of sex for american women and it didn't take hollywood long to pick up the queue we've been driving for two hours where are you taking me be patient it's a beautiful surprise look look over there i want you to know you are the first one to see it you must tell me what you think but you have to say yes rudy you are a child you cannot afford any of this let us sign a new contract for

tired of that you know how to make everybody love me well that is easy you see you're the guy who jumps on a horse in one bound or rides into battle on the back of a camel you're the hero with a sword who fights a dozen villains to save the heroine from a fate worse than death whatever that may be i mean you're the fellow we all wanted to be when we were small but me more than anybody because i was only a girl i always have to be like that always never get caught in a two-pant suit and always write with a feather rudy i uh i found this book it's called the chic it's got a lot of camels in it it's perfect for you you could wear a sheet through the whole film and then if we can get it there's blood and sand and miserable care and camille why don't you give me a chance to surprise you you finished the scenario yes i finished it and i spoke to natsimova and i told her that she would be crazy if she didn't insist upon you to play armand opposite her well tell me quickly no not quickly now you're gonna have to think about this not zimmer's last two pictures died at the box office and you you're on your way up everybody's trying to latch on to you be careful of charms i'm not so naive as i look oh you couldn't be now natsimovo wants to see you tomorrow when you finish on the set in her dressing room i arranged it but please be careful june why didn't you tell me before because i was afraid to run out and buy beverly hills you're the most wonderful woman who ever lived i know i know max demand rudy do me a favor huh don't buy this place can't stand the damn orange blossoms four horsemen i thought it was absolutely charming only a russian would find a world war charming a sense of humor a rarity in handsome men did you hear that natasha she was with the russian ballet she has no emotions since she was three years old she's been standing on her toes destroys the nerve endings but she's the greatest designer in films her sex and her costumes are absolutely fantastic so i put up with her now i know all about her ah no one knows all about her well nathanica what do you think have we found our mind for our camille if she agrees the role is yours i rely on her judgment completely please i'm playing an eskimo if you now save me no no natasha rambova is a very serious person no one has seen a smile well serena leave the drawing for a moment this is more important what do you think of mr rudolph valentino when were you born first you must tell me how old you are not the year the months a day may 6th and may 7. i am not joking neither am i my mother says i was turned around at midnight i started to back into the world 20 minutes later the rest of me finally arrived it was the next day taurus he'll do well that's settled that's it like that yes you have the role the most important moment in my life decided like that what did you expect trumpets no but something have you seen me in the four horsemen no have you ever seen me when i wasn't wearing an animal it isn't necessary the stars decide everything not for me for everyone i don't want it i don't want to park because maria ren was born before midnight but i'll take it i want to buy an orange your cup but it is too late oh come here you must not speak of death but life live live for me let me open the window to life oh god you were all my word with you i had all things without you nothing hello i am so sleepy do not wake me imagine a leading man who is not afraid to weep you're going to have to do it again too much bosom showing but i'm dead what difference does it make makes the 9th gown 9 design look terrible ah what a tyrant you had me crying too when did you become an actor i wasn't acting i received a letter from italy this morning will somebody stop those stupid violins they're driving us out of our minds shall we quit for the day no no moves are the only things i have success at if only my mother could have known why don't you tell her natasha she's dead maybe i can help you reach her tonight at my house come on natasha not a seance i'm sure rudy doesn't believe in that garbage perhaps his mind is more open than yours the levels of consciousness we aren't even aware of will you let me try i've done things more foolish not lately without beginning without end this is the bond between us and the dead within this circle we call upon the spirits to join us here if you hear me answer once someone in this room has lost someone near and dear to them very near and dear to them who is it that's not my mother's voice you've upset them rooney please sit down darling i know how you must feel but we're only trying to help you didn't know my mother she was a strong woman if anybody could come back she could you owe her the benefit of the doubt rudy please okay start the act again you upset them once more i don't know if ah i think you should apologize madam to you and her friends are my guests this is my house it was my mother with mine she would have expected better manners of you what do you know about my mother she would spit on that old fraud i wonder what holder lies about me what lies you heard what they were saying rudy i don't speak italian laura must have spread them all over town it means homosexuals shut up is that what's worrying you so darling this is hollywood they say that about everybody how would you feel if they said that about you what makes you think they don't i was a dancer they say that about all ballet dances they say that about me and nazimo because we're always together is it true why don't we find out about both of us so so so i hope you enjoyed my music it's lovely so here's europe just slip into something comfortable i thought it was expected but you never know what to expect natasha winifred shaughnessy of salt lake city i can't even make borscht how did you get to be natasha rambova same way you became rudolph valentino i made it up when i joined the russian ballet with a name like that i didn't even have to dance perhaps with a name like valentino i don't even have to be romantic highly overrated if a man and a woman really love each other sex is the least important part of it in a big sigh i didn't really bring you here to seduce you tonight though we'll probably get around to it someday it's in your horoscope i cast it today do you really believe in that of course i do what do you believe in calvin coolidge what i believe is that you planned entire evening rudy you're going to be a very big storm and nazimova's pictures are losing money do you drink vodka i don't know i never drank any good we'll try your virginity did you know that i uh chose all the scenarios for her films i designed her sets chose her leading men i gave her a career good boy good god i can do even better for your career than i do for herbs could find good literature instead of pulp novels for your scenarios i could design splendid sets for you and i could help you to get out of that terrible contract you signed with the studio it'll only make them rich not you i'm being honest is that so terrible yes why because i'm afraid i might fall in love with you and come home on another kettle track are you mad at that everyone says i'm a barracuda that's a fish very wise very fierce that's what i need right now if it's on my side i'm very much on your side until a bigger fish comes along wow um marian it's not ready sam i just finished the screenplay rudy loves the idea i think it's the sword and the bernice that got him you know he's like a kid about costumes as long as he doesn't have to pay for them you know what bernoullis has cost today oh sam you'll make it back 10 times did i tell you the big scene the sheep drags the english girl off his horse carries her into his tent throws her down on the bed and then we fade out no then he rapes her shame on you i know your mother well we'll cut to the clouds the moon the desert you can cut to the pope they'll close us up anyway sam i'm telling you it's a new day nobody believes in the stork anymore except you and amy central mcpherson well let me think about it maybe if we can find a way to keep from going to jail we'll make it damn that's the spirit that made the industry great what's that pirate doing here did you want to buy jessie lasky of course not you must have heard the applause and crawled through the window that monza thinks he's going to steal valentino for his studio you tell him that i own rudy's contract sam sam you're not leaving you want to know how much i hate him i'm going home to my wife nuts to the graphic how about the new york times it's unbelievable the papers i didn't pay off are giving rudy bigger raise than the ones i did destroys your faith in human nature awesome jake you think rudy would walk out on a contract might get pushed well i'll have to talk him out of that can i talk about natasha too what does that mean whatever happened to us he was such a lovely couple oh don't be silly jake rudy doesn't even know i'm a woman as bad as that huh philadelphia hello jesse hello jim you know i don't approve of kidnappings in my house you uh haven't heard the ransom offer june dear we're only trying to do what's best for rudy's future and you know all about the future don't you dare you must have heard darling i have a crystal ball no darling i heard you had two i don't want you to use her on any of his films i want to borrow from the set which is trouble who isn't now listen i know what you think but if she had never get to the top she can help me oh all of a sudden you want to be at the top what's wrong with being rich i tried being poor and just like all the rest of them now what happened to the orange grove i was a child i like children they don't jump contracts lasky says his lawyers can get me out just for a handful of silver he left us just for a ribbon to stick in his coat i don't suppose they read much robert browning and puglia do they i'm not leaving you you are coming with us why don't you listen lasky wants to make the sheet you told him my idea yes of course natasha says the book is trash and your scenario would have to be written but i know did you like my opinion of natasha no why not because as soon as we can arrange it we're gonna get married and all those stories you've been talking about natasha likes them well excuse me all to hell but i got another assignment jewel they're all your ideas they'll all belong to you come on why don't you go dance with natasha maybe she'll let you lead all right all right i'm sorry i should have realized that i won't sign a deal with lasky not if it is hurting you i am not a charity case and you take the screenplay you take the stories you take the ideas i make you a present all right i win good whoever told you you could dance you know you've been stepping all over my feet so so tell me a new word was added to the english language uh the newsreels breathlessly covered the whole story every man wanted to look like rudolph valentino except jake who decided to look like a barber to help out was his greatest promotion all the more frightening because it became a snowball careening downhill the faster the money came in the faster natasha helped spend it it was no contest no matter how much rudy earned natasha kept gaining on it he started to build her a castle in the hollywood hills she designed every detail posing for publicity shots all the way falcon lair rudy called it and planted orange trees in the garden while natasha ordered a ballroom with marble floors they were to move in as soon as they were married rudy made two pictures in a row in a vain attempt to pay for it cassettes and costumes were by natasha he never wore a two-pant suit and always wrote with a feather the day after he shot this scene for blood and sand in a bullring in mexico jake drove all the way back to hollywood to see me well not exactly to see me here uh rudy doesn't trust western union thanks but no thanks did you hand me that dictionary we got to get a shorter language he sent me all the way up from mexicali to deliver this invitation i'm sorry i'll leave it here maybe you'll change your mind no chance when they finish shooting tomorrow he's not even going to change costume he's going to marry natasha in his bullfighter outfit how appropriate death in the afternoon so what do i tell him tell him i'm too busy packing you want me to tell him why why do you think because natasha has bad-mouthed you all over town you're leaving hollywood because you can't get another job you tell him that and i will cut your heart out if i can find it now will you get out you know you don't fool me you don't fool me either did he send you or was it all your idea you might be able to keep him from making another mistake he is a big boy now okay natasha said you didn't have enough manners to show up that beast you tell her i got more damn manners in my little finger than she's got in her whole body now get out you know will you shut up or i'll trade you in for a goldfish oh my god you're starting to look italian hey run for the border you can still make it she's got a furlong and a half to go isn't she beautiful can you run in that outfit it was your idea that the costume yeah sure it's great publicity for the picture unless someone figures out which one's the ball uh the hotel is closed today well i have an invitation to the hanging i was a very good waiter you do everything very well the happy bride yeah see darling come talk to me over there constance carr the hollywood bombshell wants one with you alone oh i'm flattered i love her flips she's going to be a very big star hold on to your hat i think she's looking to make it a double honey why have we never met i'm one

tires for that you don't think that was a big thing it was a very big thing come and meet the bright i i really don't think i'm up today besides i have to get back selling my house moving to god's country blackfish avenue then it's true how much money do you need from you you couldn't buy a chicklet without a cosigner i'm managing sure two rolls-royces you haven't paid for either a big house
