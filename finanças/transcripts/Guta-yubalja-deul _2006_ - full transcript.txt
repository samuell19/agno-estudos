A bloody aria. Screenplay and directed by Won Sinyeon. Planned and produced by Lee Seoyeol. Supported by Kim Taehoon. Tired? I feel great. Shall we take a break? I think we rested enough at the restaurant. Professor, can we change the music? Why? You don't like the aria? Yes, but we've been listening to it all day. Well, Eels and arias don't really go together, do they? - Hello? - Darling, it's me, Sujin. I'm at the hotel lounge. Where are you? Stop playing around, darling. Professor, is that you? I am sorry. You just ran a red light. Only fools abide by the rules. But you should always obey traffic signals. What? What did I do? You ran a red light. Show me your license. Me? When? May I see your license? You must be mistaken. I always abide by rules. Please let me off with a warning? Give me that. Now, sign here. Man, you're too stiff. Sign here, now. Let's compromise. How about something minor, like no seatbelt. You should learn to relax a little. Thank you. Look who's also not wearing his seatbelt. Now, sign here. Korean cops are so uptight! Sign here, now. Is that all you know how to say, 'sign here'? - Sign here, now! - I am signing it! Thank you You're lucky. Why? You had drinks during lunch, also. Professor, what are you doing? It's a red light! You... son of a bitch! Hope you rot in hell! You motherfucker, come here! That son of a bitch, you're dead. Welcome to our village! Does this road lead to Seoul? - Why, you worried? - No, not really. You have other plans today? No, but I need to be home by evening. Why? What? That cop following us? Something was moving... Inside the sack. Must be some kind of animal. Country people are always hunting. It's a dead-end. Let's take a break until I sober up. Come on. This place is great. It's so quiet, a man could die here and nobody would know. Don't worry, I won't kill you. What's that? Kind of brain respiration exercise? What are you doing? Wait up! Now, try some! You know what? What? I had a huge crush on you. When I was in school. Really? Yes... I did too. Do they often ask you to judge in a lot of auditions? Eh... not so much. Large-scale musicals are much more in these days. Ummm. Professor, Will I be okay? How was it? It was my first audition. I tried my best but... I'm worried. You weren't too bad. The director said so too. But you have a lot to learn. Not everyone gets to be a star. Are you gonna help coach me? Sure... Depends on how you behave, though. I'll be good. Oh you're very good now. The question is, will you continue to be? How was my singing? It was fine. But you could have done better at that part You know, that part that goes into high note. You know, the first part. Stand up, and put that potato down. Professor! But here? Haven't you seen singers practicing in the mountains? You become one with nature. Do I have to explain everything? That shows you're a novice. Now let's take it from top. ♪Pa, pa-pa. ♪pa, pa, pa, pa. ♪pa, pa, pa. - ♪pa-pa... pa-pa-pa. - ♪pa-pa... pa-pa-pa. - ♪pa-pa-pa... pa. - ♪pa-pa-pa... pa. - ♪Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-gena. - ♪Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-gena. ♪Bist du mir nun ganz gegeben? ♪I am your lady!

He cut his wrist in front of the Dickhead with this huge knife. 'You motherfucker, you tell the teachers one more time. And I'm going to cut my throat.' Wow, man. That's so fucking awesome.

Why would they want to die, you idiot. See, it's weird. Shit, he's not moving at all. Is he really dead? Hey man, are you dead? - Hey, get away from there. - What do you think you're doing?

Real estate business? - Did you happen to come here alone, sir? - Yes. Why so polite, all of a sudden? Stupid, he's a music professor. A music professor? Wow! Hey, did you? Last Tuesday, at the international match. You sang the national anthem, didn't you? Why are you saying that, it's embarrassing! Give it to me, you bastard. Yep, he's the guy. I recognize him with the bow tie. You were singing along the national anthem too. - Really? - You know, I think I've seen him as well. I can't believe I'm meeting a TV personality! Hello! Nice to meet you. Meat is coming. Bongyeon! Bongyeon! Meat is here! Step off for just a second, please. I'll take you there in a jiffy How much did you get? Was my dad looking for me? Today's butcher day. He was worried. You left your hearing aid at home. Who's the lady? Oh, she's going to Seoul. She hitched a ride. I'm taking her to the bus terminal. You haven't washed again, sticky bastard? Hey, why is this fancy car stuck here? Wasn't us. - Is he the owner? - Yeah. He's from Seoul, he's a professor, a music professor. A professor? He sang the national anthem on TV, at the football match the other day. Did Ogeun get his hands on him again? Hit a home run? You know him. We couldn't stop him. Hey. I'll take you there in a jiffy. Take a seat. We'll take off soon. Professor, How's your head? I guess I'm fine. Can you get up? Oh no, the car... We can't even get it started. It's temporary nuber... What are you doing? Oh, I'll get it out for you. Not everyone can drive this car. Those scratches and dents are damn serious. I said, I'll get it out for you. Hey, let's try it this way. Let me see. It's shiny because it's new. Leave it alone. You're not supposed to press that. You know how much it is? Get off. Where's the hood switch? Is this it? Is that it? You're not supposed to press this. This is... damn it. One, two, three. Excuse me. Give us a hand. Something called cooperation? Now, when I give the sign Press this. This one, okay? And... When the car gets unstuck Press this, the brake, okay? Come on. Come on! On three. One, two, three Now, push! Again, push! Push! Ahh shit, it's not working. No, it doesn't. Damn, it's fucking heavy, man. Probably because it's a Mercedes. Hey, the meat is burning. Hello? Hey, Poongnyeon. It's me, Bongyeon. Yeah. No, he's from Seoul. The car got stuck. Yeah. Under the bridge, yeah that's the place. Yeah All right, how long then? What? A big accident? Who? Those motherfucking sons of bitches. Are they fucking blind or something? They never do anything right. I'm going to fucking cut them up and mince them into a meatball, Sons of bitches. Fuck. The police on patrol ran into a cultivator. Might take some time, getting the patrol car and the cultivator out. I see. Join us in our barbecue while you wait. Professor. Come here please. Umm, it's delicious You'll let it burn. Eat up. It's burning! It's burning! He's quiet today. Yeah, we scared him a little. Now he's pretending to be dead. He'll wake up when he's ready Yeah sure. What's his Guinness Record so far? A day and half. Something's in there? Yeah, don't worry and have some barbecue. Try some. Umm, it's great. Wow it's so good. Don't professors eat this kind of food? Huh? - Yes, you. - Yes. Meaty meaty ribs You should definitely try some. This meat is famous around here. It's called triple layered pork, it's the butcher that makes it unique. Oh, you recognized him right away! Try some. It's so chewy Professor, this one here is a butcher with an uncanny instinct. I've seen it many times First, he goes to the pigsty and looks at them. Do you know how the pigs react? When their master shows up The pigs think he's feeding them and gather up, Oink oink... Oink oink. Then this one here looks at them, and swings his bat in the air once. Do you know how the pigs react? You'd think they'd run for their lives, right? Noooo, pigs are not afraid of humans, especially their master. You know why? Because he feeds them every day. Anyway, The pigs think he's giving them food So they press their heads against the cage, and... this moment is the highlight He points at one of them and says 'You're my baby' Just like that, ' You're my baby! '. It's instinctive. Pure instinct. To me, they all look the same, but he somehow knows He says the pig was sneering at him or something And then, he starts beating up until it becomes sausages. Making a mess, turning it into sausages. 'I know you were laughing at me you pigly motherfucker! ' Beats the thing into a pulp Why were you laughing at me? ' Oh, my stomach, my stomach. That's a funny story... Did you say you came alone? Yes For a breather. You say you're a professor? He sings Listen to his voice, 'For a breather' Not everyone can not do that. ♪My mommy bought me ♪the Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt. Don't pay any attention. He used to be really smart. But the army changed him. His senior officer beat him up with a baseball bat Saying he was laughing at him or something. Beat him into a pulp. You bastard, stop it, I beat him up too. Oh, that's why they discharged you for serious medical condition like ruptured eardrum, and insanity? They discharged that bastard as well for the same reason! This one here smacked him with a shovel on the day of discharge. Lucky you didn't go to prison. How could you hit someone with a shovel? Hey! - Are you laughing at me? - Yeah, I'm laughing at you. You're... You're laughing at me? Yeah I am. Is it time for your medication, you motherfucker? Want a piece of me? Feeling that instinct of yours about me? Do I look like the pig? Just wondering. Whether you were really laughing at me or not. Idiot. Do you even know what an instinct is? You should be quiet now, rather than sorry in a minute. Hello? Yeah, is that you Poong-nyeon? No, not yet. Come straight in. Yeah. We pushed back and forth, but couldn't get it out. The car's stuck completely. She's not wearing any panties. Yes. Shut the fuck up, how do you know? She's not, I'm telling you. Fuck you, she's gotta be wearing thongs or something. Fuck me, fuck you... have you ever seen furry panties? You live in Seoul? Where about? I lived in Seoul once. Wangship-ri, near Hanyang University, somewhere in Seoul? So? May I take her to the terminal? I can take her to Seoul. It'll only take an hour and a half. Never mind you, now go get some firewood. Your ride's for just one person. You wouldn't want uncomfortable. That's why you still have a lot to learn. Why do you think I'm here? You want to borrow my Thunderbolt? Why? Can't I? Sure you can. Motherfucker... I did it. No thank you. When the wrecker comes, would you like a ride? We're going in the same direction. Hello? I'm giving her a ride to the terminal, right after. Well, since she's going to Seoul... I said I'm taking her there soon. Tell us yourself, Which would you prefer? It's okay, be honest. I said you can be honest. Well, I'd prefer the car. I don't want to trouble you any more, and he's on his way to Seoul anyway so... Whatever, take the fucking Mercedes then. Thank you. Why are you thanking me? What are you thanking me for? What? Professor Yes? So what are you fucking thanking me for? Get him out of there. Come here. Come here. I said come here. He said come here. Come here now. Come here now. I won't hit you so come here. He won't hit you so come here. Come and join us. Hey, let it go, and bring him here to join us. Kneel, you bastard. Now, eat. Ogeun, it's ARMY TIME! Parade rest! Dodge the bomb. Dodge the bomb.

Didn't you hear me? Take them off. Why are you doing this? He's still a kid. Let him go. Showing you something fun. He's a really funny guy. Is it because of me? Because I said I'd prefer the car? Is that why you're upset? Every word you say will only make things worse. What's keeping you, sucker? What this? Hey, it's a lead pouch for exercising. Wait a minute. Are you working out these days?

Why? You need help? Would you like to help him? Please stop. Didn't you hear me telling you to go help him? Let me go. What are you doing? She said she prefer the Mercedes. Get her! Let go of me. You need the Mercedes. You can't just leave. Yes, promises must be kept. You are monsters. And so are you, professor. You talk as if you two knew each other. What? I don't know her. Hey, miss, Are you crazy? Son of a bitch! Ogeun, let me borrow your bat. Can you sing us the national anthem? I've never heard it sung live by a professional singer. Here's your microphone. And you, Hongbae. - Huh? - Make love to the girl Huh? She's not even wearing panties. I thought you didn't know her. But this is... Mind your own business, sing the anthem. You don't know her so what's the big deal? Don't you think you're going too far? Sing the entire anthem. Then you get to go free. What's keeping you, sucker? - Let me go, you bastards - Dammit, keep still. Professor, help me! - Hyeonjae, - Let go of me, you bastards! Pull up your pants and come here. You guys, stop I found this in the car. I got in the car, first. 'I don't know this girl' 'I don't know this girl' Miss Injeong, the photo doesn't do you justice. Why are two of you here? And why did Miss Injeong run away? Let's do it like this then. Anyway it happened. The professor and Hyeonjae, one on one. If the professor wins before they fuck Miss Injeong, the two of you can leave immediately If Hyeonjae wins, we'll never touch you again. Seriously. Let's stop this. I said, I'll let you both go quietly if you win. Let's talk about this. One on one! This is not right. Why? You don't know how to fight? Let's act rationally. I'm not a violent person. Isn't this rational enough for the professor? Huh? - Now, get ready - Hey. Set, go! - Bongyeon, do we have to? - Do it, you suckers! Let go of me, help! Please don't hurt me. What are you doing? Let him have it. - Don't do this. What do you want? - I said 'Go' you suckers. ♪Until the East Sea's waves are dry and Mt. ♪Baekdusan worn away. ♪God watch o'er our land forever!
