This is the infamous Ghostly Village, it's well-hidden. The Village Head, Old Hawk sends his men to lead criminals from all over the place to hide here. So, they've grown stronger and stronger. Lately, the villagers are getting restless, they're planning a revolt. So the 8th Prince has a meeting with Chu Liuxiang, they're planning strategies in the Snowy Palace. The time is crucial. General Chu, you must act tonight! Eighth Prince, you've an immaculate plan. The people of Ghostly Village are unpredictable, if they already have spies around me, I believe this is the only way to sneak in. I don't think even the crafty Old Hawk could think up a plan like ours! Are you saying that I'm more cunning than Old Hawk? It's almost daybreak, you should get yourself ready. The plan's about to start. You should take some rest. You need to put on a good show tomorrow. What is it? Assassin! The next day. Residence of Eighth Prince in the capital. Teacher Long, Chu Liuxiang's back. Teacher Long, Eighth Prince was killed last night. Says who? I saw with my own eyes. Eighth Prince. Chu Liuxiang, you're back finally. You aren't the Eighth Prince. Why not? Because... You thought you killed me last night? In fact I placed a dog in my bed. You just killed a dog. Chu Liuxiang, tell me who sent you, I could spare your life. You're smart! But I'm not stupid enough to give you a name. Alright, Teacher Long. I'll let you handle him. Yes. Chu Liuxiang, this is my deputy, Lan Meng, the Magical Dragon with Golden Spear. And my other deputy Fang Hao, Silver Sword. Go! Chu Liuxiang, see where you can escape to! -Lan Meng. -Here. Summon my three students. Golden Finger, Broken Heart Sword and Soul Snatching Bell. Tell them to catch Chu Liuxiang right now. "Du Qi" 15th of March, 9-11pm. At least you're on time. You won't be able to find me after today. You want to run? Hand back the 78 lives of our Black Wind Clan's brothers first. It's not dawn yet. Time to go and catch Chu Liuxiang. Wait. Who're you? Liu... Changjie. You're looking for me? No, I'm looking for your teacher, Long Wu. 17th of March, dusk. Long Wu's second student. Zhou Bailong, is on his way to track down. Chu Liuxiang after he has received the order. Boatman, I want to cross the river. Why won't you answer me? He won't. He's dead. 3 days later, Long Wu's 3rd pupil "Soul Snatching Bell" is also on his way. Who're you? I'm the person who has just killed "Golden Finger" and "Heartbroken Sword". "Tomb of the Emperor Gaozu of Tang" Lan Meng. Here. Is this the 1st of the month? Yes, Teacher Long. It's past 9pm. Why don't we see the trio? There's a man in black outside, he'd like you to take a look inside this golden box. Where's the man in black? I'm already here. Stop. Did you kill the three men? Yes. Do you know that the trio were famous martial arts experts? I wanted them to take care of something important. I could kill them three, that means I could get the job done. Me alone. If I'm right, Chu Liuxiang must be on his way to Ghostly Village, he should have reached the Black Forest. You can await him in the pub at the end of the forest. You're finally here. Who're you? Who're you? Who do you think I am? I thought you're here to kill me. A person carrying a golden sword, drinking from a golden wine container that's pricelessly valuable, and is being hunted after. Then I could assume this person must have got into a lot of trouble. Very smart. Why don't you ask who I am? I should ask who's trying to kill you. If I'm right, I think they're here. What? I'm surprised that someone would try to help you, you old thug. Please, could we work this out? What are you doing? Misters. How much did the old fool pay you? Why're you risking your life for him? Nothing. Why are you young people picking on an old man? He killed his brother's family, and robbed everything. How did you know? His brother is my father. What? Your father wasn't a decent man, he's a robber. He robbed all his fortunes. And what did my wife do to you? Why did you rape and kill her? You're a rapist! You take any chance to sleep with others' wives. What's the big deal that I slept with her? But she's your sister's daughter! Then you're related! That's right! He's my uncle. And he's my wife's uncle. You... Me? I'm known as "The one who disdains his kinsfolk", Dugu Mei (The Handsome Loner) If I've disowned all my family, how would I have any relatives? Silly. Don't be so smug. I've sent out thirty six invitations in the underworld, you think you can run? You want to know where I'll flee? Fine, I'll tell you. I'm off to the Ghostly Village. Then we must kill you here. You're going to Ghostly Village? Yes, I've bought a death contract. Can I come along? Alright, if you get rid of my good relatives here. Deal! I think we're done for the day. Heroes, please. Do me a favour, I'm Chu Liuxiang. General Chu. Why don't you two kill me? Come here! Come on! Where should we go now? Look. Heading towards moonlight, a pub will be seen at dawn. Go in, and someone's there to meet you. This way please. Please have a seat. What would you like to order? We're not drinking today, but we're trying to find... a place for the sunset. Sure...it's closer than you think. Please follow me. Wait. Chu Liuxiang fled so far for the sunset? Who're you? I'm here to kill you. But I know I need to kill others first. That was quick. Chu Liuxiang, if you don't want to kill me, please go back with me. What about option three? Then I'll choose on your behalf. Strange. How come I've never heard of such quick swordplay before? Never thought I'd forever need to be after Chu Liuxiang. Stop it! Stop! What are you doing? Chu Liuxiang... You experts are... We're here to lead you to Ghostly Village, we're their representatives. You paid us a lot for the contract, we must do our part to protect you. Come on! Drink up! Ghostly Village is just up ahead. Please. I bid you farewell. Please. Strange, this is the cliff, there's no passageway; where's Ghostly Village? You're already in the area. As long as you step into the clouds, you can reach Ghostly Village. What? Step into the clouds? That's suicide! We're heading to Ghostly Village, not hell. How come you can float on clouds? Who are you? I'm a Soul Snatcher. I'm here to lead you to the Ghostly Village. Do you know the village entrance is called Sunset Gate? Only during sunset, the passage-way could be seen. Sunset is almost over, and you will soon find the way. What did I tell you? Step into the clouds, and you'll reach the village. Come on. "Hell’s Bridge" After crossing the bridge, you're indeed two ghosts, and please forget about turning back. This is Hell's Cellar, do you need to buy any wine? Sure, no matter as a human or ghost, I want a drink. Please come with me. This is your house. Nice. Hurry, put it on the table. This is our butler's service. If you need anything, he's the person to ask for. I need to take the other guest up the hill. Please. This is a blanket. Lots of people here keep a low profile, if you don't want others to know how you look like, you can cover your face with it. I heard we've a famous guest here today. So it's you! Shut up! Told you to watch your mouth. We've an important rule here, you must know. That's not to tell the backgrounds of others. His name is "Roaming Soul", he likes to find out others' secrets. The night view is really something here. Are you alright? I'm fine. Do you know who's that in white hair and red cape? How would I know? Everyone seems so mysterious here. Then again, you've lots of enemies here. Such as those on Bat Island, and members of the Magic Water Palace, they all want to kill you. How do you know who I am? What did I tell you earlier? People are strange here. They won't ask you directly, but they'll soon find out who you are. Xuanyuan Fourth Light and the General are betting again, come take a look! Hurry. That would be quite a show! It's a huge bet. Damn it! I'll take my chances. What will you take off if you lose? Pants. He'll take off his pants if he loses. Maybe you should drop your pants first. You'll lose! Let me give you a hand. Go to hell! You go first. Fine. One, two, three. One, two, three. Your turn to strip! What General? Her nickname is General, but she's a woman. They are the worst gambling addicts here. I'm sure she lost all her money today, that's why they're starting to take clothes off. Xuanyuan Fourth Light? Yes. He's the son of Xuanyuan Third Light, who's also a gambler. Whoever loses hereon must take his. Taking pants off isn't interesting anymore. Well, since you've lost all your money already I'll give you one more chance to gamble, your left arm is the stake. I'm not lucky today. Let's stick to the pants. I'm bored with it. Deal or no deal? Very well...as long as the game continues I might win. Alright, you go first. All my life I've never met another person who's so addicted to gambling. Six, six, five. Your turn. Leopard. Six, six, four. You lose. Wait. I want this arm too. Who're you? I thought there's a rule that you never ask about someone's identity? Very well, how much are you paying for his arm. Doesn't matter, whatever the limit is. You want in? Not the traditional way. Let's bet on who's quicker. Who's quicker? This man is a thief, he has a fast hand. I bet that he can take the knife, and you won't use these three fingers. What? You mean he takes the knife, and I couldn't? Yes, as long as you stand where you are. Put your hand away. When he gets the knife, you won't need these three fingers. Are you kidding me? She's so close, and I'm standing so far. No matter how fast I'm, she'll win. If I really lose, then please chop off your left arm. With your right hand, hand her the money I lose. Pal. Shut up. The bet's on! Get the money ready! Listen up. If he picks up the knife and you won't use these three fingers to touch the handle. Then you lose. Shut up! Let's begin. Sure! One, two, three. I win. Please use the knife to chop your arm off. Damn you! Wait. What now? We've won! But I picked up the knife first. But you didn't use my three fingers. What? I was very clear. As long as he picks up the knife, and you haven't used these three fingers, then you lose. My three fingers, not yours. Hey pal. Thanks for saving me back there. Don't mention it. You're from the capital? Where do you live? I live here. I'm sure you're someone important outside, otherwise they wouldn't give you such a nice house. And you? Me? I live on the mountain. Right. Who are you? Why are you here? Oh I almost forgot. We aren't supposed to ask anyone's identity here. You know what. I'm sure someone will tell you who I am by tomorrow. Thanks for everything. Next time when there's a bet, I'll ask you to come along. Thanks for saving my left arm. Lady. Is this part of Ghostly Village? Why not? I heard that the villagers here aren't human. Why would there be such a lovely place here, with such a pretty girl. If I've guessed right, you must be Master Chu, who's just arrived. How did you know? Who else would be poking into others' business? That's a good guess! My name is Zhong Ling. I'm indeed the most special person here. Because everyone else was forced to come here. Except me! I've been living here since the start. What was that? I meant I was born here. So your parents...sorry. You don't need to apologise. I don't have parents. Even if they're around, I don't know who they are. I grew up here. The villagers leave me alone and I wouldn't bother them. That simple? You don't believe me? To me, what seems simple is actually very complicated. There are so many troublesome people here. But I think you're the one who's the most complicated. What's that? That's Old Hawk striking the bell at midnight. Whenever we have an VIP guest, he'd gather everyone at the Sunset Hall, there, he'll introduce the VIP to us. Who are the four elders sitting next to "Roaming Soul"? They're the infamous four Wudang traitors, they killed their Head at Wudang earlier. And the two monks sitting beside us, they stole the famous "Rejuvenating Exercise" from Shaolin Temple. So there's not a single good person here. Not one! And that includes you! Old Hawk is here. What's going on? You'll find out later. Sorry. Sorry. Old Hawk, they're "Roaming Ghosts". Old Hawk, they're "Wudang's Four Swords". You can go now. Yes. Whenever we have people returning, Old Hawk would do that because he worries that someone might try to sneak in here. That's why he must test their kung fu style. And then, he would know. I see. Old Hawk has it all planned out. Well, who are the people sitting here? Everyone. Though it's our rule that we can't speak of anyone's identity here. But there's one man here, I'm sure you all recognise. I'm gathering you here, for I've good news. With him here, I'm sure the day we hope for will soon arrive. By that time, all of the "ghosts" here will be able to go back to the outside world. What does he mean? You'll know. And now, there's one more martial arts expert who's joining us here today. Let me introduce him. This way please. Strange! How come he's living next to me? I find it strange also. Why are they putting me in a house next to you. Who are you? Liu Changjie. (Street lined with willow trees) Why did you try to kill me in the pub yesterday? I'm here to tell you that, it was a misunderstanding. I bought a contract yesterday, and was planning to come here also. I saw you, and I thought you're after me. That's why I fought. Who would have thought? The famous Chu Liuxiang would hide here also! And how would I know that you're telling the truth? Simple enough. If I'll try to kill you in the future, then you'd know I lie today. Otherwise, I'm telling the truth. Quite right. Ghost! Ghost! Go take a look! What ghost? You'll see. Come on! Hurry! Over there! Come on! Over there! "Loft Open Half Day" Let's go inside! Ghost! What are you doing? This isn't the place to joke around, I'd be really scared. Is this place really haunted? Although the villagers here are all ghosts, but that ghost is real. Old Hawk. The phantom is here again? Yes, Old Hawk. We saw him at the Moonlit Lake earlier. And now? We chased up to here and lost the sign of it. Just wouldn't rest in peace, you should head back. You won't find that phantom! Go home. Yes. Oh it's flowers. What else could it be? I'm trying to be nice, bringing you some flowers. And you almost broke my arm! Who are you? Could you tell me? What's your name? They all call me "Cousin" here, all my "cousins" are males. What on earth are you doing here so early? I worry that you got scared by the phantom last night, that's why I am here to check on you. And I've found out a big secret, that I want to tell you. Alright...what secret? They said the phantom is the real Old Hawk. And Zhong Ling is his daughter. What? Zhong Ling is the phantom's daughter? You don't believe me? It's simple. If you want to look for the phantom, start asking Zhong Ling. Who're you looking for? Me? No, when we tried to catch the phantom the other night, I passed through here and thought it's a nice place. That's why I'm here to take a look. Right! This is the prettiest place in the village, but also the most horrible place. Is this place haunted? I've never seen one. The main reason I'm here, is to ask you a question. "Hu Xin Pavilion" What is it? Have you seen a jade pendant like this? I can answer you that. Have you seen this before? On whom? I said I could answer you, but I didn't say I've seen this jade pendant before. In that case, thanks. In that case, thanks. "Hell’s Inn" Place your bets. Come on...place your bets. Place your bets. Two thousand taels. Alright, two thousand. Place your bets. Seven thousand, eight thousand, nine..., and one grand. Ten thousand in total. Xuanyuan Fourth Light, this is ten thousand in total. Ten thousand taels. What's the bet now? I'm betting them on the phantom. They said it's haunted, and the phantom lives up on "Loft to Heaven". Xuanyuan Fourth Light said no. That's why we bet him to stay there for one night. One night is nothing, I could stay there for ten nights. But tonight, I pass. Chicken. It's not that. I don't have ten thousand taels of silver with me. How about I sponsor you? And we'll both go there tonight. The two of us? It's your fault; my excuse is that I don't have enough. I don't want to be here! And yet you made me! The night is still young, I don't know how to make it through. You put those there earlier. Damn! I was scared for nothing. What are you doing? Once I'm drunk, I won't know anything, and I wouldn't be scared anymore. If you're drunk, you wouldn't know if I leave, and you'll be here all alone. When the phantom arrives, you... Good point, I can't get drunk. Xuanyuan Fourth Light, if I'm correct, you don't seem to be someone so scared of ghosts. I'm not scared of anything, not even if I need to bet my own head, but I'm scared of ghosts. It will appear here in a minute... Ghost! What are you talking about? There's a ghost! See for yourself. I honestly saw one! I'm telling you, it's right at... What are you doing now? It's right outside. Outside? Nothing. Are you sure? I am sure, it's outside. But I don't see anything. There was one! How come the ghost has feet? Where are you going? Who are you? I'm the "phantom" you've been looking for. Come on! Phantom is a real ghost, but you have legs. Roaming Soul, why are you trying to kill me? You should remember about two years ago, you rampaged our Bat Island? I'm the son of White Hair and Red Cape. I wanted to kill you the day you arrived. What now? Where's that damn Chu Liuxiang? He could be killed by the ghost. What if the ghost returns? Can't be. Chu Liuxiang is invincible. There's only one ghost, if it's gone. And there's no ghost here. What am I afraid of? Damn! Roast chicken...who would have thought? Ten thousand taels of silver is such easy money. Cheers. Cheers. Smells good. Ghost! Ghost! Damn! What's wrong with my eyes? Strange, how come the chicken's missing? No matter where you fly to, I'll catch you! You're back finally! One leg missing? Here. Ghost! Ghost! Weren't you fighting a ghost earlier? You're a shady character. Why aren't you at "Loft to Heaven"? There's a real ghost there. What? Another one? I know you're close by, come out! Come out! For you. Are you Chu Liuxiang? What do you need him for? I asked you whether you're Chu Liuxiang. What if I'm not? Impressive! That was the "Shadow". You're Chu Liuxiang. How did you know? Other than Chu Liuxiang, who else could handle my 18 strokes of "Shadow"? There's only one man who knows "Shadow"... Could you be... That's right, I'm. What? I've a secret to tell you. I didn't lose, stop playing dumb. I'm not, but you are. I didn't lose, why should I pay? Master Chu, I'd like to invite you over for dinner. Come in, Master Chu. Here you are. Please have a seat. I had no idea that you're Chu Liuxiang the first time we met. I'm sorry if I've offended you. I've prepared some dishes and wine, to make it up to you. Is there any other reason? The other thing is, I heard you're gifted. You can make women very happy. You want to try? Certainly. Now? I've here, a special aphrodisiac. If you drink this wine, it will make you feel very good. Excellent. Wait. Wait. General! You! You only find me when you're gambling. Why don't you invite me for the food? Luckily I read the note in Master Chu's room, or else I wouldn't be lucky enough for this special meal. How old are you? Thirty five. Do you know that sometimes when a man is with a woman, they want some privacy. Can't be. When I was in the brothel, they're often two men and a woman, or many women and one man, but it's never one man and a woman. Well we're not in a brothel. Beat it! Gambling addict. Do I have to chop off your arm first? Fine! I'm leaving. But could we have a bet once more before I leave? What do you want to bet? Whether this wine is poisonous. What did you say? Have you got it wrong? I've no grudge with her. Why would she poison the wine? You don't believe me? Look! Look! There's nothing. You've wasted the good wine. Don't you believe me? It's the truth. Do you know who she is? Of course he does. Or he wouldn't have swapped the wine already, he's hiding it in his sleeve. Brother Liu, good observation. What? You... The wine he threw was yours. And this is what you gave me. You men! What show are you trying to act? Show? It's not just us. Come out! The friends who're hiding. Didn't expect so many of you from Magic Water Palace. What? So you knew that she's from Magic Water Palace. She's the half sister of Yin Ji's. She got kicked out of the palace for her promiscuity. Later she killed a dozen of martial arts experts, and was forced to flee here. Shut up! Over there. It's none of my business. You're slutty like your elder sister, but you're so far behind in your martial arts skills. Trying to get yourself killed. Old Hawk's place. Old Hawk. You lot... We're not Old Hawk. But we wear his clothes. The signal, let's go! I sent the signal, to lure them away! Come with me. Why are we running? I'm afraid someone's coming after us. Thanks for saving me. Old Hawk's residence is off limits. How would I know? I was chasing that General. Really? I don't believe that. Why not? Let me be frank with you. I'm here to look for someone like you. I knew that Chu Liuxiang wouldn't come here with no reason. I guessed right, you're here to investigate on Old Hawk. What? Let me show you something. Open it and read it. The first royal guard Ling Changfeng has been ordered by me to pretend to be Dugu Mei, to investigate Operation Thunder. The Eighth Prince. What's this? You still don't get it? I'm a spy sent by the Eighth Prince. I'm here to investigate Ghostly Village's plan of revolution. This is my proof. And what's this got to do with me? What's the matter with you? The Eighth Prince has already told me, it's all an act. His plan is for you to team up with me here. First, I'm not sent by Eighth Prince. Second, to prove my innocence, I'm taking you to Old Hawk. What? You're really not sent by Eighth Prince? Not only that, I'm determined to get rid of those who're sent by him. I must kill you first. Old Hawk? That's right, it's me. Good timing. So he's a spy sent by Eighth Prince. I know, I sent him. What? For Operation Thunder that we start in a few days, we need your help. Before we tell you the big secret, we must test you. Operation Thunder. That's right. The plan we've talked for years. It will finally start tomorrow after dusk. You said Operation Thunder is a plan for us to have a second chance. What exactly do we have to do? Do you really want to know? Of course we do. But I'm not ready to tell you. Why not? Because I fear that there're spies among us. Spies? That's why I would only tell you that it will happen tomorrow. The signal is, all of us will wear a red scarf on them. As for what you need to do, where to go, and whom to kill. This person will inform you then. What? Me? That's right. You're the chief organiser. You must all leave except him. Operation Thunder, what's that? Just like thunder, lightning, it will rock this world. And I'll turn this world upside down. Think about it. We're all criminals here, there's nothing for us except an execution outside. Because of the laws outside, our villagers are on death row. But, if I'm in charge outside, then all the villagers here would become first class civilians. So Operation Thunder is... That's right. My plan is here. It's Prince Eighth's Birthday Dinner tomorrow, go into his residence and assassinate him. What are you doing? What do you think? At this hour. Don't you get it? The lamps are pretty, did you do this? Red, white, red. So, you... It's me. No one's around. Follow me. There he is. What? It's him? You... Take it out. I had no idea. That you're the one sent by Eighth Prince. Life is full of surprises. What's Operation Thunder? Take this to Eighth Prince right away. Operation Thunder. 8th Prince's murder on his birthday. In the end, we found out what Operation Thunder is. So they plan to assassinate me. Should we inform Teacher Long right away and uproot Ghostly Village? Wait. Firstly, we still don't know who Old Hawk is. Second, Chu Liuxiang has told you that we're still surrounded by spies from the Village, that's why we must keep this a secret. We'll set up a trap on my birthday. As for the security at the birthday hall, I'll let the martial arts experts you've been training with in secret take care of it. Yes, Eighth Prince. Master of Huanzhu Hall's arrived. Welcome... You're here too? Four Seniors of Wudang Clan's here. So there are lots of martial arts experts that work for Ghostly Village. Master of Huanzhu Hall, you've dropped something. Someone's waiting for you in the study. Old Hawk in sky is looking for dead is the code. Go! What are you doing here? I'm here looking for the dead. For whom? For the Old Hawk in the sky. What? Lan Meng? The next of kin of National Teacher Long? That's right. I'm the organiser of Operation Thunder in the capital. When do we strike? Go and tell everyone that, all the lamps will be blown out around 9pm, the main hall will be pitch black. You can take action then! 9pm. At the time, the lights will be blown out. The target? Assassinate Eighth Prince. What? And the weapons? All ready, it's inside the gift box. Go and inform the others. Sure. Have some wine. Now that all the guests have arrived. Let's toast to the Eighth Prince, before the meal. We wish the Eighth Prince longevity. This wine isn't for you to drink. Old Hawk's got it all planned out. Look. Cheers. Cheers. Would everyone please be seated? What's going on? What's happening? I'm not sure. Listen you all! Operation Thunder has begun! The villagers of Ghostly Village are here to assassinate the Eighth Prince, and the wine's spiked. You're here to die. Lan Meng, what on earth is this? Teacher Long, you better leave. I was your staff, and I don't want to kill you myself. Listen up! Men of Ghostly Village. Hu Fei, the Hermit of Tianshan and the special guards are here to protect the Eighth Prince! Go! Teacher Long, take care. I'll kill the two traitors myself. Why isn't Old Hawk here? Let's go! What are you doing? Old Hawk hasn't shown his face yet, something's wrong. That's right. I'll go and save them, you bring some back up. Alright! Cover me. Retreat! Ghostly Villagers! Go! "Sunset Hall." Strange, who betrayed us? Could it be the General? She was angry with Chu Liuxiang. That can't be. The General has gone missing after she tried to kill Chu the other day. She wasn't there at the Prince's residence. Old Hawk. Chu Liuxiang! You've got some guts to be here. Why not? Didn't I tell you last night that we're the only two who knew? That's why you're very likely to be the spy. Actually I knew all along, the spy is one of us. If I don't come back, how could I catch you, Old Hawk? Chu Liuxiang is a brave man. Don't you realise how many of us are here? Do you think you can catch me? I forgot to tell you, to me, nothing is impossible. Tell me then! Who's the real one and who're the fake? Stop wasting my time. Alright, take off your hats. Now you can see? Aren't you worried that you'll get killed? Don't worry. You're the only one who'd kill me today, and vice versa. I guess not. And someone who sent by Long Wu. You? Surprise! Stop talking to them! You're not the one I want to catch. Here I come! I'll take care of Old Hawk. Or the others would say we didn't play a fair game. Alright, don't let him run! Where's he? What's the matter? Old Hawk's signal. Four again? They are fakes. He's right. He knows that I'm real, because there's a cut on my arm. Now you can't tell, who's real and who's fake. Not Old Hawk. Damn it! I'd lose everything if this is a bet. None of the four is, then he must be. Correct. Lan Meng? How come it's Lan Meng? Come on everyone...let's drink to the disintegration of Ghostly Village. Especially Master Chu's great help. During this plan, I've made a huge mistake. That's why I must apologise to National Teacher Long. Because both me and Master Chu thought that Teacher Long has lots to do with Ghostly Village's Old Hawk. We even thought you were the Old Hawk. I'm sorry about it, here's to you. You're too kind, Eighth Prince. In fact, I've been trying to uproot Ghostly Village. Apart from the excuse of going after Master Chu, I also sent Liu Changjie there for back up. Who'd have thought Master Chu did it without my help. I should really drink to Master Chu at this time. Teacher Long, you're too modest. If I've done anything to have offended Teacher Long and Master Liu before, please forgive me. Let me drink to you first. Cheers. Cheers. Eighth Prince. So as to celebrate the annihilation of Ghostly Village, I'd like to invite you all to dinner in my residence. Eighth Prince. Master Chu, please. Please. Who're you? Master Chu, do you remember me? Teacher Long, what's going on here? This is simple enough. You always thought I was Old Hawk. That's why you tried to kill me in Ghostly Village. You didn't expect that I came up with the best plan, I went along with your plan and destroyed Ghostly Village. And you thought you succeeded. You walked into a trap tonight. But on that day, I killed Old Hawk. That day in Sunset Hall, you fought with me. Then, I realised it was an emergency, and left the hall. I went to my room, and swapped clothes with Lan Meng. Then I left the Village. And we came back to set this up, to trap you all. Hereafter, I'm in charge of the martial arts world. You... Me? I'm different from you. The reason I went to the Village not because of any grudges. It's only because before my mum died, she told me that my dad's Old Hawk. What? Your dad's Old Hawk? That's right. I sent him there to keep an eye on you. No wonder everything went on so smoothly. Except for today. Help! If I'm correct, there's another Ghostly Village underneath. Please. He's finally here. Who's he? You're still alive? What? Of course my dad's alive. And he wants you killed today. Who's he? He's your dad. He's the real Old Hawk. One evening about five years ago, he suddenly sent Dugu Mei to tell me to meet him at "Loft to Heaven". I didn't expect to get ambushed, and was pushed me down the cliff. Luckily I only broke my legs, I survived. What proof do you have? Did your mum tell you, there's something I've got? Yes, a jade pendant the same as mine. Dad. Dugu Mei. Now, you must have run out of stories to tell. No wonder you tried to flee to the Sunset Hall. The show doesn't end here. Don't stay too close to the stone pillars. This is such large space. Watch out! He could be hiding there. Don't worry, there're so many traps here. He must have gone back up through another path. Look. We're still at the same place. No wonder he comes and goes like a phantom. In the end, you'll both die inside my Golden Cage with dynamites. I can rule the martial arts world again in three years. I guess not. How come? Your trap is impressive, but there's too much smoke. It's just my clothes inside the cage.
