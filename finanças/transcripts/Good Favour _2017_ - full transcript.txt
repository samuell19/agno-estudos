Who are you? - Hey! What were you doing in there? Who are you?! Eh? What were you doing in there? Come on, get up! Hey! - What are you doing, son? - He was in your house. Come on. Come on, get up! - Hans. Hey... You don't need to be scared. Don't be afraid. Okay? - Try to breathe through it. Breathe slowly. That's it. That's it. Time to go home, boys. He was in the house. She shouldn't be left alone. - Mom wasn't disturbed. You must handle yourself better. - I've been replaced on the Council. Yes. Joseph will take over for a while. Of course. - It's getting late, Shosanna. Put the girls to bed. - How is he? - He's sleeping. His fever has gone down, it should break overnight. - And the wound? - It's not serious, he'll be fine. - Good. - You're leaving him here? - Yes. - But we know nothing about him. - He's in need. Do you mind him staying here, Maria? - No. - Bring him to the Council in the morning. Good night. - Good night, Mikkel. - Take care, Hans. Come on, Anne. Second door on the right. - Come in. Have a seat. You can sit down. Do you speak English? Do you understand? - Yes. - Good. Good. So, let me start by saying all those in need are welcome here. Once you contribute to and can adapt to community life, you may stay as long as you want. Here, every day, we seek the face of God. We tell Him that we're willing to do as He wants us to do. We pray that He will show us His way. Can you tell me your name? - Tom. - Tom. Where are you from, Tom? Where were you before you came here, Tom? - I've been... I've been in the woods. - What about your family? - Where are your parents? - They're dead. - What about other family? - There's no one else. Are you all right? - Can I have some water? - Yes, of course. Joseph. Sometimes our experiences leave us unable to speak about them. It's okay. - The smoke calms them. See, that's where the queen has laid eggs. There. And there. Look how big they are. That's where they've sealed them up already. - Ah! It hurts. - The more you get stung, the less it hurts. It doesn't wanna come out. Now, suck out the venom. Quick, before it sets in and gets really sore. Mikkel says we shouldn't be afraid to suffer. When we fell over as children, he'd sit us on his knee and scrub out the dirt from the cut with a toothbrush. He asked us to tell the story of Jesus carrying the cross while he was doing it, so we'd remember our suffering was nothing. I hardly feel them anymore. - The gospel shows us that God always has a plan for His people. It reminds us that even in times of hardship He never forgets us. We have been tried recently. Tried a lot. But our strength is to be found in each other. We must remember that. God's work is present in every child's smile, in every calf born, in every small and great moment of every day. Tom? Tom found us yesterday. I let him know that all those in need are welcome here. God in His wisdom is allowing Tom to start afresh. As Paul said to the Corinthians, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, "he is a new creature. "The old self in drowned in baptism." A new beginning is a precious thing. I hope you will make him feel welcome. Welcome, Tom. - Welcome, Tom. Let us pray. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Why are we with the kids? - We're not baptized until we're 18. You'll get used to it. It help us to live better. - Your Opa is here. Will you go and sit with Oma? - Oh! No, no, no, no, I'll manage! No, give it! Between your fingers. Here, you too. If you touched your eyes, you have to wash your hands straight after, okay? That is important. Yes. - Good girls. Okay, come on. Okay. - I don't like it. - I know. - No! No! - You will be fine. You'll be fine. Marta. Try to stay still. Marta, please. Marta, come on. - I can hold her? If you'd like. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Try to stay still. Are you brave enough? Okay. - Thanks for letting me stay. Come on. Come on, come on. - Go on, pick it up. Put the lid back properly. - Now you have to be very quiet. Don't make a sound. Don't move a muscle. Shh, he's coming. Tom! - We're not allowed to go that far! - There's people in there with the Devil in them. How did you get your wound? - How did you find us? - Mark. - How long were you in the woods? - He doesn't remember. - You're not in charge. - Every day is the same in there. It all looks the same. Sometimes I walk for days and sleep for a long time. I never knew how long had passed. - Did you see anyone else in there? - You don't have to answer them. - Isaac got lost in there. - Marta. - Who's Isaac? - Hans's son. - Stop. Stop it. - It was God's punishment, for what Anne did. - And Hans. - I'll have to bring her home. - He must be dead. Don't say that! Now stop crying! I can't carry you. - Okay, children... We need to come in line. Hey, hey. Need to come in line. In line, everybody. You too, Ollie, come, in line. Come, also in line. Elizabeth, Marta. Good. Now listen, and be ready to sing it back to me. Shosanna, will you sing the scale? - Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do. - Good. And... Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do. - Very good. Let's take Let The Heavens Be Glad.

One here. Are you settling in okay? - Yes. - There now. Well, if you need anything, you know, you can ask me. - Thank you. - Sophia took me under her wing when I first joined. The front fields used to be my family's farm. My parents died when I was 17. The community took me in. Pull the sheet up to her chin, and fold back, that's right. Everyone is taken care of here, like a family. I don't know how I would have managed if they hadn't come for me. Lift her arm out from under the sheet. What happened? - I must have fallen. Mikkel says, "We shouldn't be afraid to suffer." - Yes. That's right. - Are you hungry, Oma? - Don't do that. - The kids made some pictures for you, Mom. They were worried you couldn't see outside. They all wanted to come and show them to you. But we thought we'd give Marta and Elizabeth the job, didn't we, girls? - Yep. - Yes, Oma. - Yes. There's more color in her cheeks. - Yes. - Joseph is going to town on Thursday. Let me know the supplies you need before then. - I'll make the list tomorrow. - I want to take her to the hospital. - Maria is taking care of her. - It's too much for Maria. She needs to see a doctor. - Come on, get down. Come on. - You know what she would want. - If we had asked for help, we might have found Isaac. - We won't put her into the care of strangers. We must pray, we must put our trust in God. God, - God... We're willing to act as You want us to act, to speak as You want us to speak. - Hey, hey. Come over here, gonna show you a trick. Come on. Come on. Go here, here. Come over here, come on. - Watch carefully. Where do you feel my pulse? Can you feel it? - Yes. And now? - No. - So what are you doing back here? - Tom's magic. - Is he? Where's Jacob? Jacob, come with me, come. - Tick-tack-boom, come, in the middle. - Tick, tack, tick, tack, - Hurry, hurry, hurry! - Tick, tack, boom! - That's okay, go again. - Tick, tack, tick, tack boom! Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick-tack-boom! Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick-tack-boom! Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, boom! Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick-tack-boom! Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, boom! - Come on, Jacob. - Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack. - Uncle Mark is gonna sit with you. Try and get a good price for it, Catherine. Aren't you coming? - I can manage. - Race you to the middle! Don't be stupid! - What were you doing at the lake? - We were swimming. - Just you and Shosanna? - Yes. Are you upset? - No, I trust Shosanna. This won't heal, if you keep getting it wet. Shosanna is different than other girls you might have met before. We live differently here. - I know that. - Good. Shosanna will change the dressings every couple of days. Keep it dry. - Catherine must have got a good price for the honey. - What? - The whole family are gone. Joseph waited for hours, but they never turned up. - They took the pick-up truck. Joseph and Mark had to ask for a lift back. - Lot's wife professed the true religion. Her husband was a righteous man. She left Sodom with him the day it was destroyed, but she looked back towards the city against God's clear command. She turned her back on God. She was struck dead at once, and turned into a pillar of salt. And our Lord Jesus Christ makes an example of her by saying, "Remember Lot's wife." Remember Lot's wife. It's a solemn warning, if we think of the person Jesus names. He points to one whose soul was lost for ever. And it's a solemn warning if we consider the subject Jesus is addressing. He's speaking of his own second coming to judge the world. He speaks of the terrible state of unpreparedness in which many will be found. Judgment is on his mind when he says, "Remember Lot's wife." Our Lord Jesus is full of love, of mercy and compassion. He could pray for those who crucified him. He could weep over unbelieving Jerusalem, yet even he thinks it right to give this solemn warning, and remind us of lost souls. Even he says, "Remember Lot's wife." Jesus reminds us that those who do not trust completely in God, not only cannot expect his protection, but should expect his judgment. - Who fired? Are you okay? It was Joseph. - Sorry, it was me. I don't know what happened. A stupid accident. I'm sorry. - No harm done. Let's keep moving. - I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Okay, who's next? - Me. You do it. - I don't know the words. - Come on, Mark will tell you what to say. - Do you reject Satan? - I do. - And all his works? - I do. - And all his empty promises? - I do. - Do you believe in God? - Do you believe in God? - The Father Almighty - The Father Almighty - Creator of Heaven and Earth. - Creator of Heaven and Earth? - I do. - Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, who was born from the Virgin Mary? - Who was crucified... - Who was crucified... - Died, - Died, - was buried, - was buried, - rose from the dead, - rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of his Father? - I do. - I baptize you - I baptize you - in the name of the Father - in the name of the Father - and of the Son, - and of the Son, - and of the Holy Ghost. - And of the Holy Ghost. - Amen! - Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen, amen, amen, amen! - Shosanna? Come on. Come on. - Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh. A messenger of Satan to torment me. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me. But he said to me, he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you. "For power is made perfect in weakness. "Therefore, I am content. - Therefore, I am content. - With weaknesses - with weaknesses - insults, hardships, - insults, hardships, - persecutions, - persecutions, and calamities, for the sake of Christ. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong. - "My sheep, hear my voice," says the Lord. - What were the children doing in chapel this evening? - The heat makes them restless. - They were looking at Tom. - Why are you suspicious of him? - I just wonder how long he's gonna be staying with us. For as long as necessary. If you don't like it, you should take it up with Mikkel. - Mikkel knows best. Please tell her to stop. - She's suffering. - I am your wife, Hans. - Hello there. - They're not here. - Really? Where are they, then? - Went in the pick-up. - When? - Opa waved to me. - Mom? - Marta? What is it? Ma? Amen, amen, amen! - Don't worry, Dolly. Tom will find Oma and Opa. - He's magic. What are you two talking about? - He can do special things. - What special things? What do you mean? What do you mean, Marta? What happened? - Tom woke her up. - He woke who up? - Shosanna. - What are you talking about? - She drowned. - He, he, he prayed on her. - Why didn't you tell me this before? Did Tom tell you not to? No. - Don't push her head. Don't swim. - He ran out in front of me, I couldn't stop. - Ma? Should have come to me. - You're right. I'm sorry. - Come on, help me. - Please, son, we can still bring her to the hospital. Please! - Get in the car, Dad. - Mom? Mom... Mom, can you hear me? Mom? - What are you doing out here? What happened back there? Are you okay? Sophia's doing well. Sometimes I come out here into the fields just to remind myself that God is all around. The children say you brought Shosanna back. Can I see? How did you get these? - I don't know. And they keep on bleeding. - Yes. - No-no-no. That's okay. God is always trying to show us his path. I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. - I thank God for you, Tom. - I thank God for you, Tom. - I thank God for you, Tom. - I thank God for you, Tom. I thank God for you, Tom. - I thank God for you, Tom. Thank God for you, Tom. ♪ Let the heavens be glad ♪ And the Earth rejoice ♪ Let the sea resound ♪ And all that is therein ♪ Let the fields be jubilant ♪ And everything within ♪ Let the trees of the forest sing for joy ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ For the Lord, he will come ♪ He will come to judge the Earth ♪ ♪ And all the peoples too ♪ In his faithfulness ♪ Let the fields be jubilant ♪ And everything therein ♪ Let the trees of the forest sing for joy ♪ - Let's go to the lake. - I can't.
