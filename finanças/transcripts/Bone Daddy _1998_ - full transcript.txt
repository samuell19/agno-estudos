(suspenseful music playing) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) And if there's anything you need to-- How do I get long distance if I use my card? Seven, one, area code and number. Do you want any lights? (phone keys clicking) You can do your express check-out with the TV, -and if you want anything from the mini-bar-- -Jerry. Rocky Carleson. Yeah, I made it on one piece, but it was like flying on rocks. Look, I've never seen this kind of heat in all the years I've been Bill Palmer's agent. I'm telling you, this is a marked change. So listen... I'm two meetings away from seeing Bill, I want to find out if we are doing any paperback business, -so I can tell him... -(suspenseful music plays) (sirens blaring in distance) (laughs) Yeah. It could be meaningful. What do I mean meaningful? What do you think I mean? I'm getting picture offers already. And we're only taking a million five from your end to start the conversation. And then you own a property that ties into a fucking tailor-made Michael Douglas vehicle. It's just that a fact's a fact, Jerry. Other people know they want the package, I'm just thinking of our prior relationship. Exactly. You work your number. I'll call you in, uh... three hours. Good, good. And trust me on this one. I'm not bluffing. (thud) [anchorwoman] New today, Bone Daddy, latest page-turner from Chicago's master of the macabre, William Palmer. A man who, as residents of the windy city will remember, knows exactly what he's talking about when it comes to matters of the no longer beating heart. This is because his last day job was as Chief Medical Examiner of Chicago. Chicagoans will recall the real Bone Daddy serial murder case of seven years ago, in which the perpetrator was never caught. In Palmer's new book, he's written a fictionalized account in which the killer is caught. While in Chicago, Palmer won headlines galore and notoriety among criminologists for cracking any number of famous and complex murder cases. So like his others, this latest book will, no doubt, crackle with nail-biting intensity. For Chicago Today, I'm Marilyn Chalmers. (seagulls squawking) (traffic buzzing) (indistinct chatter) (soft music playing) -I even spelled it right. -Thank you. It's to Patti. Excuse me, excuse me, folks, excuse me. Excuse me, thank you. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time Dr. Palmer has for today. Sorry to disappoint, but if I don't get him to his next appointment on time, I'll lose my job. You have 40 minutes. I can't be late for Peter's party. Where's Rocky? Quit worrying. Hi. Hi. I need to talk to him. Sorry. -Everything is under control. -You sure? I'm sure. That's how P.R. people keep their job. We make sure before you even think of it. I thought it was by doing P.R. That is P.R. [man] I'll try Rocky again. [Bill] Can I tell you a secret? [man] You don't have to. I already know. Hi, Rocky Carleson, please, room 878. You're nervous having your kid one jump away from your old job. You know what, you could really piss a person off. [man] It's busy again. We'll pick him up on the way. (horns honking) [Bill] Rocky? (clears throat) Are you in there? Nobody in here but me. Wasn't nobody here when I came either. I'm sorry, Donna, is it? Can we look inside? -Thanks a lot. -(phone beeping) [Bill] No wonder it was busy. (phone clicks) Phone is off the damn hook. Rocky? [man] Nice room. Yeah, there's his bag. I'm really not supposed to let you in here if it's not your room. It's so unlike him. -(bin clatters) -[Donna] Don't know how that happened. Never happened before. But, you know, room service chicken's awful popular. Thank you, Donna. (suspenseful music playing) Middle finger. Left hand. (siren wailing) [man 1] What if the Bone Daddy could be back? To tell you the truth, I started to worry when I heard the goddamn title. What's that supposed to mean? You took a huge risk and you know it. Could it be a P.R. stunt? That's completely insulting. [man 2] How about a fan paying homage? My agent may be in danger, you've got to let me in on this. -You've been out of it too long. -Nonsense. You're also still pretty fucking arrogant. Which is one of his better traits. [Bill] We were both on this case before. I know this man. And so do you. All right. I'll let you work with Hewlett. -Chief. -She's the cop. You're the consultant. Consultant. Do you understand? Now, don't you have a party to get to? They probably told you what a grouch I was? Didn't really do you justice. Spoken like a badge. How does a badge sound? Depends. Some of your colleagues used to have problems with me. They called you Dr. Frankenstein. That is correct. Well, at least he was smart. [Bill] They tell you to flatter me? [Sharon] Yeah, but I didn't pay attention. I know this is all a bit sudden, and it's probably not the job you've been dreaming of. But since you're so brilliant, I'm supposed to take you seriously, right? That would be good. I have an ex-husband with that attitude. [Bill] Marriage is hard. Especially for cops. Yeah, it was hard all around. Any children? -No. -You didn't want them? Excuse me. Just trying to find out who I am working with. Look, it may come as a surprise to you, but I've done this before. I don't like your defensive attitude. It doesn't mean that you're offended, it means you are insecure. You can't afford that on this case. You hesitate, you lose. -(door opens) -(gravel crunching) (orchestral music playing) (indistinct chatter) (music stops) Ladies, gentlemen, I'd like to... uh, propose a toast to the man that we are here to congratulate tonight, -Peter Palmer. -[guests] Hear, hear! (all applaud) Now, Peter is the kind of man who will elevate the medical examiner's office in this city to better things. And just like his father, my very good friend, Bill Palmer, just like Bill, Peter will make a great contribution and I wouldn't be surprised one day to hand my job over to him. -(guests laugh) -Watch it. 'Cause I could do that with complete trust and confidence. Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Palmer. [all] To Peter! -(guests applauding) -Thank you very much. (dog barking in distance) [butler] Mr. Palmer Sr. just arrived. Bill! You had us watching the clock there, buddy. There was a bit of a delay. I'm sure you've heard. (softly) Yeah, I know, I got the call. Are you all right? I'm fine. Oh, excuse me, this is... Detective Sharon Hewlett. Marshall Stone. Here I thought she was just another naive, misguided girl. Listen, I've got guests, uh... Peter's in there. (indistinct chatter) -[Bill] Peter. -Hi. Congratulations. I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay, he has been quite busy with all of this. When you get the job, you get the job. That's probably why they decided to have the party at the boss's house, right? You know, you've made your appearance. You don't have to hang around if you're not in the mood. Photographer needs you by the cake, champ. Sorry. When you get the job, you get the cake. The kids said to say hi. Thank you. (sighs) You're obviously very proud of him. Yes. I always knew he'd do well. Did you have anything to do with it? Get a close-up of the cake. Get a really nice one of the cake. -Dr. Palmer. -Trent! How have you been? You're looking like a million bucks. Looks deceive. Still making Y cuts for chump-change. How's my kid doing? He inherited the talent. Keep an eye on him? Count on it. [woman] Bill. I came to share in the glory too. That must be because you're his mother. Must be. Who's the brunette? Come on. -How are you? -Excellent. Don't tell me. I won't. It's a shame you missed the toast. -We waited as long as we could. -Is this from you, Trent? You know what a ham Marshall Stone is. [Peter] Oh, they're great. (sighs) Look at him. I have just realized, he's not a kid anymore. I had always hoped his life wouldn't be quite so involved with death. He's not involved with death. He serves life, because he studies the end of it. Ah... -You're as good as ever. -Don't. Never better. Never covers a lot of ground. Ex-wife? Yes. Twelve years. Look, um, I didn't mean to insult you before, when I made that comment about helping Peter get his job. All right. He didn't want my help. I tried. [Peter] Jesus Christ! [woman] Oh, my God... (gasps) Oh! Oh! [Stone] No one touch it. (dramatic music playing) I think this is for you. Damn it! (eerie music playing) [Trent] Dr. Palmer? You were right. They are all from the same victim. Sorry. Run hair and fiber inside and outside the boxes, wrapping paper, bows, the whole thing. You'll find fingerprints from the people who handled the boxes, nothing else. Still has to be done, Dad. If you have a coherent profile, Doctor, -please don't sit on it. -I don't. Then why don't you just let her do her job? Don't apologize for me. I think you should apologize for yourself. Do you think I've lost my people skills? You never had people skills. You had rank. All right. I think, you might wanna see this, Bill. I'll take that. [Sharon] What is it? None of the bones came from the cadaver. Which means? It means... this is being done... to him, alive. (creaking) (footsteps approaching) (Rocky breathing erratically) (panting) (door clicks) (cracks) (wincing) (thuds) (screaming) No! (grunting) (metal clanks in distance) (suspenseful music playing) (train horn blares) Bill! Bill. This morning's paper, have you seen it? -It's everywhere, we can't ignore it. -[Bill] Oh, boy. You better go to work. I don't know how to handle this. Don't worry, I'll make it sell books. Holy moley, this way. (reporters yelling indistinctly) Do you think it showed good judgment to put a story and an idea like that out there? [reporter] What do you think? Don't say anything. I've got an idea. You know what you ought to do? Read your own newspaper. Then ask your editor the same question. Okay, sorry, we gotta run. (reporters yelling indistinctly) I've got a statement, folks, I've got a statement. Come on back this way, come on back this way. Hey, Frank, how are you, it's good to see you. Come on back this way, folks, I've got a statement. All right? You ready? Rolling? All right. First of all, there is no conclusive evidence to indicate that this is the original Bone Daddy. Or even anyone responding to the book. -(cameras clicking) -All it does is verify Bill Palmer's unmatched mastery of profiling, and his unerring sense of human behavioral patterns. -Okay? Thanks very much. -(reporters groan) (indistinct chatter continues) (suspenseful music playing) (suspenseful music continues) He's raising the stakes. What he did before was pretty intense. The earlier victims had nothing in common. This is different, it's a response. And he isn't finished. I'm gonna have to bring in these suspects again. Of course, after seven years, half of them will have moved out of town. I wanted to ask you about this guys, Dr. Morton Franz. [Bill] Assistant Chief Medical Examiner at the time. You had your own people under suspicion? [Bill] The killer was a sophisticated man. We suspected everybody and his brother. The evidence just wasn't there. But the killer in the book was an M.E. Yes... Like Morton Franz. Like fiction. Like you. No. Nothing like me. Franz was Bill's main rival for the chief M.E. job. Was there any other reason he was a suspect? Well, being a rival, that wasn't a reason, but certainly, it didn't help. Now... this is the pelvis of a young girl, probably... Lisa Hollingsworth. Never found. To tell the truth, Franz was a lousy M.E., and his only hope was administration. So when he lost out, he... He hated Bill's guts. This is a rib of a man in his 70s. Probably... Stanley Chase. And then of course, there was... the affair. Affair? What affair? Franz's wife. Palmer? Tibias. We were lousy with tibias. We figured he liked them. [Sharon] Were any whole victims ever found? Never. Every bone we got, he sent to us. All in the same condition as these recent ones. With the exception of the messages cut out of Bill's novel. So, was Franz still working here at the time he was the suspect? One week after Bill took the Chief M.E. job, he had to fire Franz. Why? Professional differences. And Bone Daddy? The first bone was two weeks later. (intense music playing) (phone ringing) -Hello? -[Cobb] Hewlett? How come you're opening the Franz file? Something new? Not really, but he is a viable suspect. Okay, we all read the book. Palmer based the character on Morton Franz, and if I were him, I'd sue his ass, but the book is not the case. It's not just the book, it's the affair. It could be payback. It's a hell of a motive. There wasn't anything then, there isn't now. [Sharon] That's not what Stone thinks. When Palmer or Stone become Chief of Police, I'll shut up and defer to their opinion. But till then, count less on life imitating art and more on hard evidence. (dial tone) -(sighs) -(phone clicks) (car engine starts) (eerie music playing) (car revs) [Cindy] Shotgun, shotgun. [Mark] You got shotgun last time. Mommy, look. (softly) Oh, no... Leave it alone, Mark. Come inside the house, now, kids. [Mark] What is it, Mommy? Just come inside the house, now, kids. -[Mark] Maybe a dog left it. -Get away from it. Get away. Come on, in the house. (eerie music playing) (indistinct chatter on police radio) (indistinct chatter) What's he telling us? That we'll never catch him. He used to be a classic impersonal killer. Meaning? He doesn't wanna know his victims, so he doesn't feel bad when he kills them. This victim's still alive. (softly) Let's hope so. Could be a copycat. No. It's the same man trying to convince me he's a genius. (indistinct police chatter) (chatter over radio) (water flowing) This isn't a cross-examination, Mr. Baxter, so can you give us a hint? Are these samples any good? Are they all jack? Pressure does not improve evidence. Excuse me, you think this is pressure? Look... Do you even understand soil sample search? Sure, when I can get my breasts out of the way, I read quite a bit. You got your little case, with your limited facts, I've got the world to cross reference. It could be evidence from where the person was dragged, where the attack occurred, any number of places. I'm not even talkin' hair yet. -What about fiber? -Fiber... is interesting. They had some on the outside of the wrapping papers. Different wrappings. And different manufacturers. The shin was Charleston Gift Press metallic finish, ankle and foot, standard Barton-Dunne ultra-weave decorative. Same on both. [Baxter] Exactly. Any ideas? Look, I, I don't deal in ideas. I'm an empiricist. The data's determined, I reach a conclusion based on it. Which could be absolutely meaningless. True. Thank you. Asshole. (scoffs) With internal examination complete, we will now close. Whatever differences we have, I'd like you to make some arrangements. You quit buying my lunch a long time ago, dad. Just protect your family. I'm well aware of that. Why do you do it like that? It's how I do it! It's not the right stitch. (Peter scoffs) It's the one I've used on hundreds of cadavers inside and out and I've never had a problem. What's she gonna do? Shake it off? Huh? What are you mad about? All right. I'm mad because in my entire life you've never shown a shit's worth of interest in a damn thing I've done. But now that you finally acknowledge that I am a forensic pathologist, that I actually make a living at it like you did, of course, you don't think I do it right. You pick apart my fucking stitches. I'm concerned. It's just I never had it before, I don't think I suddenly want your quality time now. Peter, I understand. And protecting my family! Where the hell did you get off telling me about protecting my family? Huh? You dragged my mother through shit! You couldn't protect your own family! But now what? You wanna give me advice? You're still my son. You keep your fucking hands off. (intense music playing) All right. (door shuts) (traffic buzzing) (indistinct chatter) Good men don't play against themselves. -You have time? -For you? Two minutes. (timer clicking) Tell me, Marshall. When did I become stupid enough to write the damned book? Come on, you had to write it. Don't be so hard on yourself. I was selfish. Facin' the truth... is always risky. It wasn't as noble as that. Why? Because you saw you were making money out of it? What's the big deal? Because I was willing to let it make money. Oh, what the hell? Give the money to charity. I sold out. I put people in danger. Really you're being too hard on yourself. Don't act crazy. And you're ruining your game. I'm ruining my life. Hmm. Unfortunately, Rocky's paying a very personal price for what you had to do. And you have to live with it. But then again, you always have to live with something. Time's up. (dramatic music playing) Hewlett? Anything new? Maybe. I'm, uh, thinking about some more non-Franz candidates just to cover our butts. Thinking? That's a good way of using the taxpayers' money. There are a few people who have all the technical qualifications. Butcher. Plastic surgeon. Assistant medical examiner. He very possibly has a motive. Well, that's a great idea. Neglected by an overpowering father... watched his mother in pain while she was cheating on-- I know the story better than you. I know the part about how he wet his bed until he was 13. How he had a fascination for fires. Two of the traits the experts seem to think that most serial killers have. Not to mention, millions of kids who wouldn't hurt a fly. Looks like you know Peter very well. (sighs) Okay, look... Maybe he hated his dad. God knows I hated mine. But I didn't go carving bones out of anybody. Jesus! I'd love to be there when you tell Palmer you're investigating Peter. Wear a helmet. (sighs) (intense music playing) (dramatic music playing) (phone ringing) (door opens) (phone ringing) (breathes heavily) Bill Palmer. Hello? Hello! (answering machine rewinds) (phone beeps) [Peter] Dad. This is Peter. [Peter sighs] We have to talk. But not on your machine. I think I really need to explain some things... and I know you do. I just... I don't think we can keep butting heads like this and I'm not about to just suck it up again. I will not suck it up again. So, uh... All right, call me back, or I'll call you. Bye. (phone beeps) (phone rings) -Peter! -[man] (distorted voice) Still awake? (dramatic music playing) Uh, should I know what this is about? Do you want me to hang up? Um, no. (intense music playing) I thought you might want to talk. Of course. Sure, of course, I do. You killed Rocky, didn't you? Why? He doesn't mean anything to you. Ah, you don't understand, do you? (chuckles softly) No. So why don't you tell me? What's the point? It's your point. You started this. So how do I end it? Surely somebody as literary as you must know about sleeping dogs. Look, if this is about you and me, why don't we meet somewhere face to face? It sounds like you're offering to suck my cock, Bill. Are you offering to suck my cock, Bill? -I know you, don't I? - You are going to see how naive you are. Because it's gonna get much harder to deal with when it's the girl. -What girl? -You'd hate to have her think that you're a fool. You'd eat a yard of shit to see where it came from. -What are you talkin about? -What's she gonna think of you? What's she gonna think when I'm working and she's screaming and she's wondering where the hell you are? What's the cop gonna think? (intense music playing) (clock ticking) (oven beeping) (cat yowling) (thunder rumbling) (cat yowling) Never let me down when the food's hot, do you, Oliver? (bells chiming) (cat yowling) (intense music playing) Oliver! Come on, kitty. (cat yowling) (line ringing) (phone ringing) Come on! Come on! Jesus. (thunder rumbling) Come on, kitty. Come on. (cat whimpering) -(cat meowing) -(thunder rumbling) (screams) -(intense music playing) -(tires screeching) (gasps) Sharon? (Sharon gasps) (Sharon screams) (intense music playing) -Sharon! -(panting) Get up. Come on. It's all right. Come on. (intense music playing) (muffled voices) (intense music continues) (muffled voices) (muffled voices) (siren blaring in distance) [Bill] Peter? Call me, please. I'm telling you, I'm fine. I don't need this. Detective, we've been down this road on your judgment before. You know damn well that's unfair. I'm not sure I do. I gave you some rope once even though I shouldn't have. -And you hung yourself! -Look! If you're telling me you want me off the case, then just say so! But don't insult me by telling me you want me to take a breather for a couple of days. You have been mentioned. Probably by the killer, as a possible victim. I'm a cop! Does that mean I'm supposed to go away? No, you're a cop, you're supposed to do what I tell you to do. You're supposed to be off this case. I don't want you involved. (indistinct yelling) I wouldn't. Problems? -[Cobb] And you're in danger. -Not your fight. His voice is on here. (sighs) -All right? -What? What was that about? Cobb wants me off the case. Why? (sighs) For old times' sake. I guess he doesn't believe I've learned anything all the years I've done this job. I was married when I joined the force, and I, uh, I got pregnant sooner than we had planned. You know, it wasn't like I-I lied to him or anything, I told Cobb right away, and I begged him to let me stay on the field. (sighs) My husband, you know, was givin' me shit every night saying, "Whoa, what if something happens?" You know, "What if we have to see a doctor?" And just... You don't wanna hear that, you know? (chuckles softly) And then, I, um... I'm in this situation. Turns into a chase, and, uh, I won't wait for backup. You know, Miss Tough Guy. And I go runnin' and I come around this corner and, uh... the guy kicks me. (mellow music playing) And I, uh... lost my baby. (Sharon sniffles) Lost my son because I was an asshole. 'Cause I had to be a hero. (Sharon sobs) -(phone ringing) -(indistinct chatter) You are gonna love this. Okay. Wrapping paper. This is the close-up of the back of the paper that the ankle and foot bones were wrapped in. -Why the back? -Well, look at the numbers. Dye lot and production run numbers at the end of a roll, on the back. Hmm. Barton-Dunne shipping records showing where a roll with these numbers would've been shipped. I'll be damned. It was sent exactly 150 miles from where I'm standing to lovely Bennington, Illinois, where... There are 15 Franz's in the phone book. I'm on my way. [Sharon] "In the darkest bottom of the fearful, outraged, damaged thing, "that was his heart, Bone Daddy lived for the feeling of the Big Moment. "The feeling of the cut, the give "the hot splash. "He gave this feeling a name. "He called it Kill Sport. "He could only unloose the terrible, coiled thing inside him "when he drove deep through muscle, when he hit bone. "Broke bone, cut cartilage. "He stood before his mirror knowing he must go again and again and again. "And he saw no squalid reptile brow. "He recognized no blown-circuit eyes. "He beheld instead, the mightiest purity." What in the world would a writer want to accomplish with something like this? It's fiction. Based on certain true events. But one of those events is now a sicko, out there on the loose, responding to what you wrote. I... When I write, it comes from all kinds of places, all kinds of people, different experiences. This is seven years ago. But don't you feel in any way responsible for what happens because of your fiction? Obviously you think I am. As a writer, the truth is what I want it to be. There is no real truth. There's only interpretation. But you give this guy no choice. (stammers) He has to strike back. I mean, you're walkin' on his turf. You've edged him out. If I were him, if I were the killer, and I read what you wrote, I'd go ape-shit. (chuckles) I'm sorry, if you were the killer... -I'd be very nervous. -(chuckles) And I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you. -So tell me about Franz. -Franz? He was into mathematics. He was a computer whiz, he was a good man, but he had way too many things on his plate. He was also a hell of a drinker. What about his wife? I've been waiting for that question. She was... wonderful, mad, sexy, bright. Were you close? We used to have this group, this elite group, we'd come here during our night shift with our cell phones and our beepers. We'd have discussions, play fast games of chess, and then, Carol and Franz would pop in... and he would get very drunk, very fast. And she would play chess with us. And win. Hey, she beat all of us at one time or another. And then what happened? You know what, you ask too many questions. You get the job, you ask the questions. Well... Hey, there he is. Oh, wait, now. You don't look as relaxed as I told you to be. He look relaxed to you? Phil, you need to help me. I need to get my book pulled. (sighs) Bill... The book is in every book store and the half the supermarkets across America. You can't pull a ship back into port when it's going the opposite way. It's the best opening title this year. They're getting incredible feedback. Tell him I'll sue. Well, have I ever been able to stop you from doing what you wanna do? Hmm? I'm sure they'll tell you to go ahead. And I'm not an agent or anything, but you do have a contract. You wrote the thing, and they spent all kinds of money to print it, advertise it and supply the retailers. So you can kick and scream all you want, but you don't have a fucking leg to stand on in the real world, and you know it! And I can't help you. Phil... Can I talk to you for a second? What? You heard me. Phil... you're fired. Put a spin on that. I hate writers. (traffic buzzing) (wheels rolling) (keyboard keys clacking) Okay, let's try it. [man] (distorted voice) You are going to see how naive you are. Because it's gonna get much harder to deal with when it's the girl. You'd hate to have her think that you're a fool. You'd eat a yard of shit... It doesn't sound any different to me. It sounds completely different. Help us here, son. We're not trained, so we're not just quite hearing what you're hearing. Right now, I've taken about half the high-end multi-dupe simul-masking out. (sighs) That means... A part of his voice is pretty much right out there for us to hear. Only it's still masked by all the other garbage I've gotta take from the rest of his voice. -(sighs) -[Bill] Peter Palmer, please. Can you tell him to call me as soon as he shows up? It's his father. On the money, Moose. You found Franz. Just outside lovely Bennington, Illinois. He lives with his son. (exhales sharply) Be careful, Hewlett. (sighs) (dramatic music playing) (panting) (breathing heavily) What the fuck do you want? We're trying to locate your father. You think my father needs to see you? I'm afraid he has to. I hear your boy, Dr. Petey's climbing the ladder. You keep it in the family, huh? Miss Detective Hewlett, has the good doctor here explained the slash and burn approach to life? -We can get a writ. -(chuckles) You see, Petey and I were accepted to the same med school, except I had to quit. Had a foot-the-bill problem all of a sudden. Unemployment in the family. We can still get a writ. You wanna talk to my father? Come on. (dog barking in distance) (door closes) [Mort Jr.] Dad, somebody wants to talk to you. -Mort? -(gasps) One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. You could've spared us this. What the fuck have you ever spared him, huh? Besides, he's far enough along, he doesn't care. (murmuring) One, two three... He's not confused about what he thinks he remembers anymore. -Kinda makes him a bad suspect, huh? -One, two, three, four, five... So get the fuck out of here, Dr. Palmer, before I hit you with the lawsuit from hell. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. -[Franz] One, two, three... -How is your mother? What the fuck are you? -Hey! Hey! Hey! -...three, four, five! -Hey! Hey! -You want to take another shot at her? She's not here! She couldn't take it anymore. You're a fucking cancer! (speaking gibberish) -You're a fucking cancer. -One, four, three, four... (panting) (Mort Jr. sobbing) You fucking cancer. Why'd you have to say that? [Mort Jr.] You fucking cancer. It's exactly what he wanted. He wanted you to come there, so you'd see that. (lighter clanks) We're wrong ruling out a copycat. You said he was escalating. He's not escalating when he keeps his victim alive, when he leaves the body, when he leaves his voice on tape, and purposefully sends you on a wild goose chase. That's a different MO. And I think it's an insider. I was in love with her. Isn't that amazing? Not so amazing. We were out of control. Tried to make it work. And then one day she just packed her bags and left. I never saw her again. Kim and I separated and we, eventually, we got a divorce. Then I quit and started writing. And in the process of it all... I lost my son, too. There's a difference. You can get yours back. (scoffs) -Joey! -Joey! -Joey! Joey! -Joey! Joey! Joey! -[Leslie] Okay, guys. -[kids] Joey! -(Joey barking) -(knocking on door) -[Leslie] Joey, hello! What's up? -[Kim] Hi, Joey. -[Mark] Hey, Joey. -[Leslie] Everybody, take your covers off, guys. Joey, what is this? You wanna go out? (barking) Joey, what... (Joey growling) Oh, my God. (gasps) Kids, don't run. Leslie? Mommy, could I have some juice? Not now, honey. We've been robbed. We better call the police. (indistinct chatter on police radio) -[Bill] How about this color? -[Sharon] Dusted there... -[man] Thanks. -[Sharon] Upstairs. I can't find Peter. I called his office, the gym, all the usual places. Yeah, I know, I called them, too. Daddy was gonna read me this book tonight. Can you, grandpa? Sweetie, why don't I read it for you upstairs? -Maybe another time. -You want me to take your book? Is there anything missing? Um, no. Nothing. [Sharon] Maybe this isn't a robbery. Maybe Peter just lost it. Okay, you can start cleaning up. We're about done here. (dramatic music playing) You know he fits the category. What are you talking about? Peter. He's an insider. We said it had to be an insider. -You got to be kidding. -Think about it. You're talking about my son. [Sharon] I'm talking about a motive. (music continues) It's his copy. I've gotta take this to Cobb. It can't be. I'm sorry. -[Sharon] Bag, please. -You're jumping to conclusions. There's not enough evidence. There's more than enough evidence. I'm getting a warrant. What are you talking about? For Peter? You're getting a warrant for Peter? Are you crazy, you son of a bitch? -You son of a bitch. -Come on. Stop it right there. He's not here and you people are making him out to be some kind of a criminal? I won't let you hurt him, Bill. You hear me? You cannot let anything happen to him. Kim. Kim. -Look, nothing's gonna happen to our son-- -(sobbing) Bill? You can't believe that. No. But he fits the profile. He does resent me. Knows all about me. That's a motive. He doesn't resent you. He wants to be like you. You don't know what it's like to have a father you can't please. He just wants your approval. (scoffs) Yeah. There's something I'm not getting. What? I have to check something. I'll be back as soon as I can. Perfect match. I don't know. He was here this morning, but he seemed upset. Trent. You have a moment? What's happening with Peter? I need your help. Well, the police, they're all over his office. I need to get into the morgue. (intense music playing) Where is he? -Where the hell is he? -Bill? Bill. Bill. -Time out. Time out. -(panting) -All right. -You're with me? Now, what are we looking for? Um... -Rocky. -Rocky? -Yeah. -He's right here. Let's take a look. Who did the autopsy? Well, nobody yet. Where did these sutures come from? That's how he came in. Rocky? Talk to me, Rocky. Tell me what I'm not seeing. The woman. The black woman that Peter was working on, where is she? Right here. Do you remember the fight we had over this? How he always does his stitches the same way? Yeah, sure. Look at them. And these... are completely different. You're right. (distorted voice plays on recorder) How are we doing? We are doing... He's good. He's very good. He went to a lot of trouble here. But nobody ever goes... to enough. [man] (distorted voice) ...sleeping dogs. What now, Bill? (intense music playing) What the hell are you doing? [Trent] Are you crazy? -Now. -What? Trent, look. The stitches on this man are the same as the stitches on Rocky. So who did the work here? Uh... Oh, my God. Peter. [Peter] I will not suck it up again. (device buzzing) So, uh... All right, call me back, or I'll call you. Bye. That was Peter's message. And this... is our filtered friend. [man] (distorted voice) You are going to see how naive you are. Because it's gonna get much harder to deal with when it's the girl. [Peter] I think I really need to explain something. Sounds like they could be similar. (voices overlap) (recorder rewinds) [man] (distorted voice) What she's gonna think of you? What she's gonna think while I'm working and she's screaming... (voices overlap) [Peter] Not on your machine, I think I really need to... Wait a minute. It's not the same. Give me that again. (voices overlap) (recorder rewinds) (voices overlap) [man] You are going to see how naive you are. (voices overlap) Right there. Right there. Right now. [man] You'd hate to have her think that you're a fool. You'd hate to have her think that you're a fool. I know him. [man] What she's gonna think while I'm working and she's screaming, and she's wondering where the hell you are. What's the cop gonna think? Holy shit. (dramatic music playing) "How naive and wrong he was." That's what I told him for making me out to be some sort of a slow child, and fucking Mort and Franz? I showed him Mort and Franz. And now I'm gonna show him what it feels like to lose something that he was proud of, something he thought that he had. (Peter groans) (panting) Can you guess what that is, Peter? Can you guess? Marshall. (grunts) I'm not cutting you up and pulling out your parts. I'm leaving you in one dead piece. I want a herd of uniforms and I want Palmer. Get them to Marshall Stone's home. -We don't have a warrant yet. -Get it. I'm on my way. [Sharon] The whole damn thing's a setup. He grabbed Peter, ransacked the house, so we'd find the book that he planted in Peter's office. He wanted us to think it was Peter. He wanted us to look stupid just like Palmer said. We've been led around by the bloody nose. I need that warrant ten minutes ago. Don't be a hero, detective. You'll get it. Okay. (siren wailing) To go from a mediocre forensic pathologist to a bad author is one thing, but when he had the gall to write about me, fuck with my masterpiece, who does he think that he is? He deals with fantasy, I deal with reality. And I'm better at it than he is. (intense music playing) Listen to this crap. Listen to this crap. "Bone Daddy lived for the feeling of the big moment. "The feeling of the cut, the give, the hot splash." What does he know about my feelings? And here. Here. "He could only unloose the terrible coiled thing "inside of his dime store bullshit." Dime store bullshit! "He beheld instead the mightiest purity..." What right does he have? What right does he have? And here. Here. He saw it all. Right through you. (groaning) (sobbing) No... (tires screech) Peter! Peter? Peter? (sobbing) No! [Stone] His perfect son, the golden boy. For the rest of his life, he'll have to live with the nightmare that you became Bone Daddy. (phone ringing) Stone! (siren wailing) Come on. (glass shatters) (intense music playing) Stone? Stone? (groaning) (tires screech) [Bill] Peter! Peter? Peter? (gasps) Oh, my God! What did he do to you? Huh? What did he do? -(Peter grunting) -Oh, God. [Bill] Peter. Do you understand? Do you understand? Peter? Come on, son. No, you're losing him, Billy. You've forgotten how phenosiodonal works? [Bill] You poisoned him, you son of a bitch. [Stone] It would take about 50 CCs of real help. I'm taking him to the hospital. What about me? Hah! You don't exist. Are you sure? Who are you gonna blame for the rest of your life? Who are you gonna blame when you can't stop thinking about your son? (grunting) Come on, son. Sit up. Up. Watch out. Behind you! No! (groans) Listen to me. Punctured lung. (groans) (groans) (groaning) (grunts) (clattering) (grunting) (water hissing) (dramatic music playing) (laughing) (grunts) (groaning) (grunts) Don't move. Son, come on. Come on, there you go. (grunts) (intense music playing) (grunts) (gunshots) (gun clicking) (hissing) (eerie music playing) Dad. (helicopter whirring) (mellow music playing) (mellow music continues) (suspenseful music playing) (music continues)
