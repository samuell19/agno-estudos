Okay, I don't think you're allowed to say that word. My kid wanted the blonde one. You know, that one. Yeah. So that one is the Buddi 2, which hasn't come out yet. -(SIGHS) -And it looks like you purchased the Buddi 1, which is this guy. Listen, I waited three goddamn weeks for this ginger piece of shit to come in the mail. Okay. Well, I'm so sorry that you didn't read the box. And even... There's a window, that you can see that his hair is red and not blonde. Thanks. Thanks for shopping at Zed Mart. (DOOR OPENS) (MUFFLED CHATTER) Heh. (EXHALES) (TAKES DEEP BREATH) (DOOR UNLOCKS) -KAREN: Hi. -(CAT MEOWING) Hey, uh, I was just... Whoa. You look like shit. What happened to you? Thanks. And watch your language. Sorry. Andy, I told you to unpack those boxes. Okay, I know, and I was. I wanted to make a mental map of where I should put everything first. You know, for maximum feng shui. I think you were maximum feng-shuing so hard, you forgot to put your phone down for five seconds and feed Rooney. You mean this busted-ass phone that we're replacing for my birthday? Dude, I've already been working doubles to try to get you a new hearing aid. I'm fine with this one, but this is my primary source of education. Oh, my God. I never thought about it like that. Wait. Let me see what your education has been getting you up to. (GASPS) -(MUSIC PLAYING) -(KAREN SIGHS) Oh, my God, I cannot escape this doll. -Okay, wait, wait, wait. -No. Gross. This is staying with me for the rest of the night. -What? You... -No. You can't do that. That's the only thing to do here. There's literally an entire world of things to do. Look, two kids standing in the rain. That looks fun. They could be anybody. They could be serial killers. Noodle. We talked about this. You said you were gonna try -to make new friends. -(SIGHS) This move is supposed to be a new start for us. Tell you what, you don't have to unpack or do anything tonight, if you just go out there and try. Give you your phone back. Okay. I'll be outside. Really, that was it? (BOYS LAUGHING) (BOY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) (BOYS EXCLAIMING AND LAUGHING) (OBJECT CLATTERING) WOMAN: We picked this up three weeks ago. But we took it home, and we turned it on, and its eyes were red. And something's wrong with it. It was just weird. And I just thought, with the new one coming out in two weeks, it would just be better for me to take this back, you know, get it off my hands. (ECHOES) So, I'm just wondering, can I get my money back? Yeah. (KAREN HUMMING) Hey, Wes! -Hi. -Hey, I was just curious. Um, what happens to returns like this? -Oh, uh... -Like, really damaged returns. Yeah, we send it back to Kaslan. And what do they do with it? Probably toss it, trash compactor. I don't know. New model's coming out. No one's gonna give a rat's ass about this thing in two weeks. So, they won't care if it doesn't make it on the truck, right? (CHUCKLES) I care. Come on, my kid's birthday is coming up. Can I have it? -You've got a kid? -Yes, I've got a kid. I had a very productive sweet 16, okay? If you really wanna know. Come on. It'll be our little secret. -No one has to know. -Uh... Just like that time you banged Susan in the warehouse. How's your wife, by the way? -(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) -KAREN: Ha-ha. Can I have it? Give it to me. -(GRUNTING) -(KAREN WHINES) And I'm taking it. There you go, Wes. Say hi to your wife. Yep. Mm-hmm. (SIGHS) -Oh, my God. -Oh, shit. KAREN: Hey! Noodle. You're home early. -Remember Shane? -Hey, bud. It's been a while. I'm... I'm just gonna make dinner. You hungry? No. Uh, I'm gonna go hang out with some kids down the hall, actually. Really, who? Gotta go. Bye! (KEYS JANGLING) (VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS PLAYING) So, what are you? Some kind of fourth floor hallway hobo, or something like that? What? Andy, right? You just moved into 401? Yeah. I see you out here, like, a lot. Oh, uh, no, it's not me. I have, like, five twin brothers, so we just take shifts. -(CHUCKLES) -(DOOR OPENS) Are you comin' in or what? I'll be right there, Ma. Just give me a minute. -Love you. -(SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) So that's the mom. She drags me over for dinner every week. So, listen, man, if you wanna have some dinner, you're welcome to join us, 'cause I could really use the backup, 'cause she... (CLICKS TONGUE) KAREN: Andy? What's going on? Is he in trouble? Yeah. Lots of trouble. We've been gettin' lots of complaints about some kid out here throwing parties, selling drugs and beer. Peddling booze... Um... Oh. That was a joke? It was an attempt. I was gonna say, "I'm the fun police." (CHUCKLES) It's not landing. Wait, who are you? I'm Mike... Detective. Detective Mike. (CHUCKLES) So, um, I'm just gonna go. Yeah. I'm gonna go. All moms are scary, by the way. DOREEN: Hurry up, son! MIKE: It was nice to meet you, Andy's mom. Nice meeting you, Detective Mike. -Bye, Mike. -MIKE: See you later, Andy. DOREEN: Dinner ain't gonna cook itself! MIKE: You're screaming, Ma. Really? Must you embarrass me like that? Ma, you can't be shouting like that. I thought you were out with your friends. Why didn't you just come back inside? Is Shane still there? No. He's gone. Come on, I've got something for you. It's a surprise. -Close your eyes. -(SIGHS) Okay. Hey! I know it's not your birthday for a couple weeks, but this move has been really tough. And I know you're kinda mad at me, so I think you deserve this. (GASPS) Surprise! Early present. (ANDY SIGHS) Is that a sigh? That's the Buddi thing you're obsessed with. Yeah, um, it's just... This thing is for, like, little kids now. It came out, like, a year ago. Okay, I know it's stupid, but I thought it'd be funny. Come on! -Let's try it. -Okay. KAREN: Just remember, it's refurbished, so it might not work perfectly, okay? (DEVICE SWITCHES ON, PINGS) (PINGING) (MUSIC CHIMES ON SPEAKERS) AUTOMATED VOICE: Your Buddi is now connected. Whoa. Cool. (STATIC CRACKLES) Hi. (GLITCHING) Are you my best buddy? (CHUCKLES) I guess?

I guess turn on the TV. CHUCKY: I will do that. What's a TV? Are you joking? That thing. I cannot process that command. -(SIGHS) -KAREN: Oh, wait a minute. It says here you gotta "sync his knowledge base to the cloud "before he can connect to any other Kaslan products." Okay, Chucky, connect to the cloud. -(DEVICE TRILLS) -Download. (CHUCKY'S SPEECH GLITCHES) Learn stuff. (WORDS JUMBLING) (DISTORTING) I am unable to do that. It's kinda creepy. Doesn't work. God. Okay, this thing is stupid. I didn't know it was that messed up. -No, Mom. -I'll take it back. It's fine. Mom. Mom, honestly, I like it. KAREN: No, you don't. ANDY: Seriously. It's great. He's hilarious. -I love you. -KAREN: I love you, too. ANDY: It's actually pretty cool. -Go to bed, Andysup. -(ANDY CHUCKLES) ANDY: Come on. (EXHALES) This is my room. (PURRING) And that's Mickey Rooney. He's a total dick, so just don't touch him. CHUCKY: Total dick. Whoa. You're allowed to say that? Cool. Uh... This is my desk. This is my sketchbook. I do fake buddy cop team-ups sometimes. Like, Dracula and Robin Hood. Or... This one's Zorro and Medusa. Kind of a deep cut. I don't know, it's stupid. I do not think it's stupid. Thanks. Pity compliments from a talking doll. That's my life. Uh... That's enough for tonight. -(ANDY SIGHS) -(ROONEY MEOWS) Do you want to sing the Buddi song before bed? No. Uh, I'm good.

ANDY: I don't get what she sees in Shane. I mean, (GRUNTS) he's not nice. (GRUNTS) He's just an asshole. (CONTINUES GRUNTING) It doesn't matter anyway. He's just gonna end up leaving us, like everybody else. I will never leave you. CHUCKY: Are we having fun now? ANDY: Yeah. I guess. Attack? You shouldn't lead with your chieftain. I still have to teach you so much about this. Okay... Um... (INAUDIBLE) Okay. And I get to roll again. So... -(DICE CLATTERS) -Boom! Double sixes! Okay, get that orc outta here. -(ROONEY SNARLS) -Total dick. Nailed that one. -(YOWLS) -Ow! (GROANS) (PAINED BREATHING) -CHUCKY: What is that? -The cat scratched me. Hurts like hell. Kitty hurt Andy?

(YOWLING) You can't do that, okay? Why would you do that? He was hurting you. He was making you unhappy. (SIGHS) Chucky, okay, listen, look at me. This is important. You can't hurt people, or cats. It's not cool. I know you're different, but that's gotta be our secret. Okay? And don't say any weird shit or creep people out. -(ROONEY YOWLS) -Hey! Cat's freakin' out. Clean up this room. Except maybe that guy. I've got an idea. Okay. If this is gonna work, I need you to look as creepy and scary and angry and mean as possible. All right? So, open your eyes as wide as you can, like... No, you still look cute. Open your mouth as wide as you can and snarl with your lips. (SNARLS SOFTLY) But kinda smile. Perfect! Okay, yes, just like that. -(SNARLS) -Okay. Try this one.

He, uh... It doesn't really follow the rules. It doesn't follow the rules? Like it has a choice? Kinda, yeah. Sorry, can I pop in here? So he just does whatever? You can make him do whatever? Pretty much. Okay, can I just point out that this is how every robot apocalypse scenario begins? -Say "dick cheese." -Dick cheese. (EXCLAIMS) FALYN: That is the coolest. PUGG: I have so many questions. Uh, who are you? His name is Andysup. -I'm Andy. -Falyn. Pugg. Why are you in the hall?
