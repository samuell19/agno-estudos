NETFLIX PRESENTS [woman] What a woman desires most in life is to feel loved. LOVE TACTICS She always seeks that attention and passion from day one. A man desires comfort. Once the excitement of meeting someone new is over, instead of rekindling that feeling, they start looking for the next conquest. Women pay attention to the tiny details of an event and go through all possible outcomes. For instance, they know and remember all the details about the first date. Women actually never forget anything. Men, on the other hand, view an event as a whole and care about how it felt. They don't have the slightest idea about what happened on the first date, but they never forget how they felt when they first saw you. Welcome. [woman] The theme of our winter collection is infusion. As you see, the designs are made of softer, more flowing materials. In our previous collection, we used a retro effect that has become more prominent than last time. Less complex, effortless designs will be in the spotlight. This year, we embrace a trend that is less influenced by the past. We mainly opted for lace and tulle in our new collection. Less stitches and clean silhouettes. You never cease to amaze me, do you? Impressive, Aslı. Let's start production immediately. [man] As you can see from the drawings, our campaign this time around focuses solely on women. Our aim is to make an association with paint. Mr. Kerem, I don't understand why that's the aim. What do you mean, "why," Mr. Altan? Well, I don't understand what makeup have to do with paint. Mr. Altan, I'll explain. When woman go shopping, they don't leave anything to chance. Especially when men are involved. More, when it concerns their home. The home is a woman's temple. When it comes to the household, they want to make all the decisions. With this campaign, we convey the idea that when it comes to their makeup, they should be in charge of things in the same way they would the walls of their own house. -[laughs] -I mean, If you agree, of course. He really is as good as they say. Well, the campaign is in good hands with you, Mr. Kerem. Let's do it. Ahmet. [chuckles] [laughing] You're right. Hey. -If it isn't our big-time sales director. -[sighs] Come on. I know you got ghosted. But pull yourself together. Can someone tell me where I went wrong? -Sure you want me to explain this to you? -Mm-hm.. You just met a guy. That same night, you went to dinner. That same night, you slept with him. -But I've never done that-- -Hold on, Hande. It doesn't matter, because he doesn't know about that. You can't blame him if he thinks that's something you do on the regular. Let me guess. Not a word since it happened. It's not just that he didn't call. What do you do when he doesn't pick up after ten calls and no call back? Wait a minute. That is not what you told me. That made the situation much worse! Honestly! How so? Cellphones are the most effective relationship weapon you can use for torture. You can use it by not calling at all, or calling again and again. If he doesn't call on the first day, assume it’s a tactic, so you shouldn't worry yourself. A second day goes by, and you start to wonder. If there's no call on the third day, you fall in love. Or you sleep with someone for a night, and they call you just nonstop. It is so frustrating and suffocating, even if you did want to see them again, you think otherwise. Sounds like you're on his side, Aslı? Of course not. I'm just explaining why they do this. They're all a bunch of typical, classic, mediocre, -insensitive, dense, dishonest… -Hold on, I missed-- -…awful, disgusting, child-- -…so, "dense…" -"Disgusting." -[sighs] In short, that's guys. Someone should find this guy for what he did to you and make him pay. Hell, yes. [Aslı] Men rule the world. Women rule men. And hormones rule women. Maybe that's why the world is as complicated as women. Come on, girls. Stop waiting for a prince and learn to control your unstable hormones first. [message alert] [woman] You keep providing us with tactics, but have you ever made a man fall in love with you using these tactics? [Aslı] You know what? You're right. It may be more fun to demonstrate these tactics in practice. In my next article, I will find a man, and make him fall in love with me, using the right tactics, and share every step of it with you. Is it true what I've been hearing? You gave the campaign I've spent all this time developing to someone else? So you can devote all your energy to this paint campaign. You know, the campaign that we nearly lost because of your cocky attitude and ego. You got that campaign because of me. And that's thanks to being cocky and confident, all right? -Are you listening to me? -Listen, Kerem. -Landing the campaign was pure luck. -[laughs] If your attitude doesn't change soon, your luck will run out. But that's not going to happen. Put me on the campaign, and I'll prove it. Just drop it, Kerem, because now, it's Tuna's campaign. Tuna's campaign? Tuna. What's wrong with him? [man] I don't know, man. Apparently, the only thing keeping them together were these cuffs. So when she left him, he handcuffed himself, or something. I'm a married man, dude. What do I know about handcuffs or whips? Just look at my butt. Like I told him, you won't find a single handprint. -Hm? -Know why? There isn't. That's why. I don't get what his problem is. He just keeps on saying the same thing. Man! You got dumped again? What a surprise. You get dumped every other day. You're not used to it by now? Get up. There's something we need to talk about. This isn't something you can understand. You're about the last person I can talk to about this. -Why's that? -Because for you to understand, you'd have to go out with the same woman at least twice. You don't even sleep with the same woman twice. It doesn't happen often, but I agree with Tuna. -This is over your head. -Shut up, you're married. As for you, you're wrong. Gentlemen, I'm a man who has completely figured out women. As someone who has completely figured out men… [retching] …getting a man to fall in love with me is going to be a piece of cake. That's so nice. I want to fall in love too. What do you mean, Cansu? You always fall head over heels with every man you say hi to. -Really. -No, no, no. Like this. It's like when you get light-headed. My stomach all in knots. -And your body gets all hot. -You start trembling. -Yeah! The shivers. Ah. That's not love. It's a cold. Picking up a girl in a bar and having a girl fall in love with you -aren't the same thing. -Hmm. You mean I can't get a girl to fall for me? I know it for a fact. First of all, I don't care about love. All that lovey-dovey BS isn't my thing. Look, man, he can't admit he can't do it. -[chuckles] -You think that too? I don't know, dude. I'm a married man. From what I hear, you regret it with all your soul. Yeah, I still don't get it. How did I think it was good to get married? -What was going through my mind? -[Kerem] See? That's how love ends. It's easy to make a girl fall for you. Women are already programmed to fall in love. The hard part is to try and live your life without being pestered, get it? Then do it. Because I don't think you have the guts to try. Huh? Yeah, come on! -Do it. -Do it. And I'll write everything that I experience on my forum. Wait, there's a problem. What if he reads it? It's all good. Who else other than us -knows Aslı writes the Love Tactics blog? -[sighs] All right, then. On one condition. That campaign you took away from me is mine after I win. Hold on-- [grunts] I can't do that. It's a once-in-a-lifetime campaign. What else instead? What's wrong? You're so sure I can't make a girl fall in love with me. Why are you worried? -I mean it. You'll be toast. -How about it? It's a deal. -Deal. -[grunts] We doing this? One married guy and two bachelors? First, we need to find a target. First, we need to find a target. Men are simple. They're incapable of any type of growth or maturing. Toilet training is the extent of their development. [whistle blows] Women are complex, gentlemen. They see things in a complicated way. So, when men have trouble understanding women, they make accusations. Women tell men that we're being rude. The old saying "It's what's inside that counts"? Of course, it's referring to your lingerie. It really counts what's inside. Yes! [laughs] Their only goal is to find a rich, possibly handsome idiot who can put up with their mood swings and hot temper. The goal when getting dressed is to tease a little and make him wonder about the hidden parts. You know, contrary to popular belief, revealing outfits won't attract men. Impressing a woman is the same as selling her a product. It's easy. Oh, by the way, you're the product. And just like a product, you have to be something they wanna buy, right? Men don't like too much makeup. Less is more. [Kerem] Women are detail-oriented. The accessories we wear give clues about our character. Listen up. An expensive watch lets them know we're not stingy. A ring says you're married. Guys, we're going hunting tonight. Tonight's the night. Girls, we're gonna lay a trap for this guy. ♪ Tellin' me to give up Tellin' me to give up ♪ ♪ Tellin' me to give up ♪ ♪ Tellin' me to give up Tellin' me to give up ♪ [woman] Hi, how are you? All right, gentlemen. Pick one. Wow, that's self-confidence. You could've chosen the girl yourself. Hey, wait, man. We pick the girl. Hmm… Not this one. Nope. Not that one. You cretin! It feels like you're picking a lamb for slaughter. Maybe he is. That's her. Whoa! Hey, yo! What about that handsome guy? He can't keep his eyes off you. Ladies, let the games begin. Come. Dude, that's a bit too much. And so what's next? We must allow the target to examine the trap. Hey, you'd better move now. Go over there. Never. We wait. He's not coming over. So we'll make him come to us. -Hot cocoa, headed this way. -Look away. [woman] Goodness me! [laughs] And our hunting adventure ends before it begins. It's just begun. -Hi. Evening. -Hello. -One mojito, if you will. -Right away. I'm Metin. Hi. Ah… Man, I swear I've met you somewhere, huh? -Oh, right! -Hmm? Just remembered why I stopped going there. [laughs] Your sense of humor's so great! -Music's so loud in here. -Mmm. We should go somewhere that's quiet. My place? Wanna go? I bet you can party. Right? Excuse me. What are you saying? Everything okay, darling? [Aslı] Uh… Um… Yeah, honey. This gentleman here asked me a question. -I think he got his answer. -That's what I thought. I'm Kerem, by the way. Aslı. Aslı? Really? You're not going to bring up Kerem and Aslı. -No, wasn't planning on it. -That's good. I should get back to my friends now. But have a good night. Thanks for that. You might wanna stay a bit longer. That guy keeps looking over here. Until the coast is clear. By the way, Tuna and Emir. Aslı. -Ah! Aslı and Kerem! -Yeah, exactly. You got it. Aslı. So where are you from? Are you planning to become a member of the Neighborhood Watch now? She could be from my town. Like to invite your friends over? No worries, I think it's all good now. I should probably go join them. Nice to meet you. Have a good night. Enjoy. -Um, why did you come back here? -Did you change your mind? Come on, chill. -He'll be coming here any second. -Don't be ridiculous. You didn't even give him eye contact. What's wrong, Casanova? She's a tough nut to crack, or what? There he goes He's coming over. He's coming over! I swear it's so fun. Here he is! Here's your mojito. Enjoy your night. And now he's gone? He's super cute, and so polite! Wait. Who's that charming guy that he came in with? [laughing] -Hey, there. -Ooh! I'm Tuna. Oh, like the bird, right? No, I'm Tuna. Like the fish. Oh, right. Of course. I'm Cansu. -It's nice to meet you. -It's nice to meet you too. Oh, Tuna's so cute, am I right? Hey, you plan for one thing and get another. You'll have to find someone else, since this one's going. No one's going anywhere, girl. Everything's going exactly as I planned. Um, maybe I missed something. No. You didn't miss a thing. Yeah, Kerem, can you drop the dark and mysterious act for a minute? Please, just fill us in. Me neither. You didn't look him in the eye, he doesn't have your number. So how do you plan to see him again and make him fall in love? Just as I planned. Through you, girl. [mouths] What do you mean, me? Aslı Yıldırım. ASLI YILDIRIM - 28 LEAD FASHION DESIGNER - BORN IN İZMİR 28 years old. Glamour brand's chief designer. Kerem Aksoy. 30 years old. Wonder boy of the advertising world. Star sign Leo. You can tell from how cocky he is. She earned her degree in design in Milan. Originally from İzmir. He's a modern-day Don Juan. He'll chases anything that has a pulse. Anything. [Kerem] She's not a big fan of social media. Barely on it. It is safe to say she doesn't get out much. His social media is just a tool he's using to score with girls. It's his hunting ground. We start the game with a chance encounter. Yes, ladies, we're ready. A chance encounter will start it all off. [both laugh] You're supposed to come to the exhibition tonight. Mr. Hakan asked you to show face. Ugh, no. I can't make it. I have plans that I can't break tonight. Mr. Hakan insists that you cancel your plans. What? He doesn't even know about it. He prepared a response on the off-chance this happened. I'm prepared for all kinds of scenarios. This isn't about selling the brand. What would I even do there? You're the most valuable part of this brand. During our sales pitch, your name gets mentioned. So that's why he said he wanted you to meet our new partner. He planned that response ahead of time? He's a man who has foresight. Kudos to him. I'm stuck. That's that, I'm going. No way. [chuckles] Come on, I need to run into this guy so I can pick him up. [sighs] Kerem, listen. -Huh? -Don't you slack off. They're looking at us, and two brands are on the line. If we don't go, and someone else closes the deal, it's not on my head. -Don't worry. -You'll go? -I'll go. -I've got my eyes on you. Well, get a good look. I said I'll go! When will I have time to find her now? Kerem, this account's a game changer. -We have to get them to work with us. -All right, I got it. SERVET KORAL ART GALLERY PAINTING &amp; SCULPTURE EXHIBITION Here you go. Gentlemen, it's right this way. Dear friends, On behalf of myself and everyone at Koral Holding, thank you for making it out on such a lovely evening. Welcome to our exhibition in Fişekhane. I really hope you enjoy it. We are excited to share it with you. Have a wonderful night, everyone. [applause] -Uh, have you met Ms. Lale? -No, not yet. There she is. I'll introduce you. You have to meet my niece. She just arrived from London. Between you and me, she went there to get over a heartbreak. She's a sweetie. Here she comes. Isn't she gorgeous? Ah, Ms. Lale, I really need to take this call. I sincerely apologise. -I'm sorry-- -[yelps] -[yells] -[Aslı coughs] [Lale] Oh, dear. [Aslı] It wasn't me. [Lale] How rude. You could've just apologized. -Look at me. I mean-- -[thunder rumbles] [heavy rainfall] [Aslı sighs] -No way. -Oh, come on. Could you get out? I really have a lot on my plate right now. Normally, I'd just catch the next cab, but I'm kind of in a bind here, and as you can see, it's the only one. That leaves two options. Either you get out and wait for another one, or we travel together for a while. -Well, this is a coincidence. -[sighs] -I'm starving. And you? -Actually-- I really am hungry, so I can't say no. To Beylerbeyi, pretty please. [driver] Yes, sir. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ I can feel your fingertips ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ I can feel your fingertips ♪ Ugh, I don't know why you had to bring me all the way out here. I thought you'd enjoy it. Cliché. What's that mean? -Welcome, Mr. Kerem. -Thank you. This way. You're pretty popular in this place. A stylish, expensive restaurant by the ocean. You bring girls here on most of your dates to impress them. Cliché. [band playing traditional music] Is he coming? Please don't! Oh, this is way too much! -[laughing] -What? -[violinist playing] -No, wait. Really, I promise-- This wasn't me. I've never seen this before. -Oh! Oh! It's ridiculous. -He must always do this. [laughing] Come on. Okay. Thank you. Come on, please don't. -[Aslı] Oh! -[Kerem] That's enough. -That was great. Thank you. -You're welcome, Mr. Kerem. Bon appétit. You said it was the first time you'd seen the guy, but he's clearly seen you before. -Appears so. -[laughs] Um… Do girls still swoon over these gimmicks, or not? [Aslı laughing] Oh! Oh, it is so over the top! [laughs] [hums along to music] It was a great night. Thank you. Meh. Good night. "Meh," my ass. You won't know what hit you when this is over, you cranky bi-- [chuckles] When I'm done with you, you'll wish you were dead. You conceited, smug douchebag. Good one. I'm going home. Come on, man, tell us. Where did you run off to? I was with Aslı, my bro. And it was actually a coincidence. [Aslı] Hello, my lovely followers. The first date finally took place, unexpectedly and completely by coincidence. When I ran away to avoid seeing that clinger, the target appeared next to me in the car. As for how the night went, he… I'll use the name "Mr. K" from now on. …is a total cliché. He's a smug bastard who uses old, played-out moves to pick up girls, and see every girl as a pushover. She's crabby, difficult, arrogant, and so hard to please. Even though I don't like him at all, I will keep my promise and make him fall in love with me. She's trying not to show it, but she's into me. Believe me. I don't know how I'm going to put up with her, though. [Cansu] That's such a great move. You got it the first time through. That's progress! -Right? That is progress. -[laughing] [sighs] Anyway, he'll be here soon. The animal. [knocking at door] -Oh, I think he's here. -[Aslı coughs] Yes? [door closes] -[whispers] What is he wearing? -[gasps] [man] Aslı Yıldırım? [clears throat] That's me. What's this? You have a package. Mr. Kerem told me to deliver it to you myself. Oh, to see the look on her face right now when he delivered it. [Tuna scoffs] Dude, are you sick in the head? What's your plan? You get a great excuse to see the girl, and you send a courier to her. Yeah. This way, she'll see I'm not the kind of man who jumps on every girl and she'll feel butterflies in her stomach. [laughs] -Again, what's your plan? -We wait for her to call. She'll call. I just-- I don't get it. Why have we been staring at this phone for the last 15 minutes? If you don't understand, then why are you looking, Cansu? He'll wait for you to call. If you don't call him, he'll call you. I just know. He'll call eventually. [whispers] What is the plan? [whispers] I know just as much as you. -You should call her, bro. -[Tuna] I agree, dude. Call her instead of sitting around. [tuts] If you call first, it means the woman has taken the reins, and you can't take them back. That's it. Be patient. She'll call. [phone ringing] [screams] [phone ringing] [groans] Hey, what's up? Cappadocia? Why would I go to Cappadocia? [Ahmet] You're taking the noon flight to Cappadocia. [colleague] Our new partners want to meet you. What does Cappadocia have to do with it? They want to welcome you to their farm in Cappadocia. [sighs] I'm in. I'm in. [Ahmet] Mr. Servet wants to talk about the campaign. Don't screw this up, Kerem. You get me? Gah! [sighs] Kerem? Aslı? [both chuckle] A bit difficult to think this is a coincidence. My thoughts exactly. I'm working in Cappadocia. Mm-hm. I bet you are. Hm? -I'm going to Cappadocia for work as well. -Sure. It's the truth. [laughs] [laughs] [sighs] [Aslı] Hey, girls. Guess who's with me? Mr. K, of course. He didn't call, but he did one better and ran after me. This is it, girls. The target is caught in the trap. There's no going back. [laughing] [Kerem] Do you really think a coincidence like this is normal? No, I wouldn't believe it even if I saw it in some movie. And I'm not so sure that it is a coincidence. Mm-hm. So you're finally coming clean that it's not. Only you would know. Wait. You think I booked this flight to be with you? [laughing] Oh, God! -Maybe you took this trip to be with me. -Wait a minute. The man who I would get on a plane to chase after wasn't born yet. Do you watch sappy love movies? Do you get your cliché ideas from them or something? -How lucky to be him. -Him? The man who wasn't born yet. The poor bastard doesn't even know what's in store for him. Oh, what a comedian. -If you'll excuse me-- -Be my guest. CAPPADOCIA AIRPORT Well, it seems we've gotten ourselves into quite a mess. What is all this about, huh? Ms. Aslı, Mr. Kerem, welcome. I'll take your bags. Your car is this way. Follow me, please. Uh-- [sighs] Welcome! -[chuckles] -Thank you. [man sighs] Aah. [kisses] -Aslı, right? -Mr. Servet? Oh, could we drop the formalities? Please, call me Servet. That sounds good. Course I will. -This is? -I'm Kerem. Ah. Sure… Advertising boy wonder. [laughs] You can go to your room, if you like. Get some rest. Allow me to show you. Follow me. Rest after the plane ride. Then we'll talk over dinner. [Aslı] Of course, as you wish. [Kerem and Aslı chuckle] [gasps] Then this really was just a coincidence. It really is a coincidence. But how? It was a coincidence, even though I'm having a hard time believing it. That's okay, because now we have a weapon that works on all men. Jealousy. Since men's actions are based on animal instinct, they see the attention of another man in the vicinity as a threat. The desire to be the alpha becomes so overwhelming that even a woman they didn't care about becomes valuable. -Oh! Aslı, dear! -[laughs] Oh, my. You look ravishing. Let me look at you. Ah! [laughs] Come, now. Let me show you my wine collection. You're going to love it. [chuckles] Hmm. Here it is. Look. Aah! Many of the bottles you see, they're older than you! [laughs] -That's wonderful. -But first, before we do the tasting, I want to introduce to you someone. My only daughter. Meltem, my dear! Surprise. [Servet chuckles] Mmm. Please meet the chief designer of our brand we have taken over, Ms. Aslı. Aslı, Meltem is the new manager of our brand. Pleasure. Uh, that there, he's from the agency you wanted to work with, uh… Don't tell me. Ah, Kerem. Kerem. Let me show you around. -Such beautiful eyes. -[Aslı laughs] Mr. Servet! Anything you want to try, just tell me. Oh no. -Ha-ho! -[Aslı] Oh! [Servet laughing] Ah, quite the pop. [chuckles] [sighs] Thank you so much. -Bon appétit. My beautiful daughter. [sighs] Hmm. There you go. Serve yourself. Aah. -To new and beautiful beginnings. -[Aslı] Hmm! [Servet] Mmm! Mmm! Hmm. Mmph! -To a swift success. -Quiet! Oh, you youngsters! You're way too naive and ambitions to even know how to really make a toast. Classless. It's all about work and career for you. If there's something that needs a toast in this life, it is beauty and love. I raise my glass to you, my Aslı. -Mr. Servet, you're too kind. -[Servet] Oh! Thank you. Thank you so much. In a minute, there's gonna be a knock, and Aslı will be at the door, and you will invite her in. [knocking at door] Oh, big frickin' surprise. You're surprised to see me? Mmm! [laughs] Everyone thinks I got over you. But I didn't give up. Not even for one millisecond. I fooled them all. I'm back now. Just to be with you. I have the perfect plan, too. [coughs] Uh-- I know you wanna get back together. It's just that you won't admit it. [gasps] Let me handle this. [gulps] And I'll tell my father everything. -I can't. -Why not? Don't act like we haven't before. [Kerem groans] No, I can't. Wait-- I can't, uh… even if I wanted to. Uh… Meltem. [gasps] [grunts] [giggles] Ha, ha. This is really-- But I have something important I really have to tell you. Hmm. About my… About-- you-- Um… [gasps] Uh… But why? Horse. -Horse? -A horse. It kicked me. [neighing] It kicked you in the junk? Mm-hm. [sighs] But how? I feel terrible just thinking about it. -Don't make me tell you. It's too-- -Sweetie, don't get worked up. So… It'll get better, right? Afraid not. It's God's will. [whimpers] We'll get through this together. Baby, here. I'll never leave you. Mmm. [chuckles] [Servet] Ah, we're over here, Aslı. Let's hit the bar. shall we? Sure. -Gin and tonic. What are you having? -Gin and tonic. He's trying to make me jealous. At the end of the night, we'll see who's crazy with jealousy. [loudly] This place is so great. I love it! [Servet] Ah, Aslı, my dear! Everything is so plain and so empty next to your beauty. [both laugh] -I feel young whenever I'm next to you. -[laughs] [Servet laughing] You keep trying, Aslı. I'm just saying, if we can fix this, you should let me try. Well, I'm happy with mu daughter, Meltem. She insisted that I buy your company. Without that, our paths may not have crossed. [both laugh] Yeah, it's great! Are you a little drunk? You had quite a few drinks during dinner. Yeah, I'm drunk from being in the presence of your beauty. [both laugh] -[Servet] Mmm! -[Aslı] Oh! [Aslı chuckles] [Servet giggles] We'd better go join your dad. It's rude, you know? Come on. So, are you buzzed? What's shakin'? Are we havin' fun, huh? Everything's good, right? -Yeah, all right. -[both laughing] [Servet] Where's my wine? -[Aslı] Ah! -Here's to you! -Yeah. -[Servet laughing] -Um… It's late. -Hm? -Shouldn't we head back? -Hmph. Oh, come on! You're no fun! Not yet. Ah, let me see here. Mr. Servet, you're nursin' that. -I hope that's not all you can drink? -[Servet] Of course not. What do you take me for? Let's order. -[Kerem] Order! -I don't just drink wine. Let's get going. -[Kerem] Can we get one? Yeah, yeah. -This over here… -Bring it over here. -You have to try these. -I'll take that. -I probably already tried it. -Here we are! All right, buckle up! -Give it here. You're gonna love this. Please. -You have some too. -Happy now? -I can't drink anything but wine! -Enjoy! -Cheers! -Here we go! -[Aslı] Mmm! Mm-hm! -[Servet] Mmm! -Too strong. -[Aslı] Yeah! -Just one more. -Too strong, just like me! Like me! Let's do it. One more. Come on. -To our future. -All right, let's go! -Ohhhh! Mmm! -Ohh… -What if he gets sick? He could die. -[Meltem] Oh! -He'll be fine. -[laughing] -[laughing] -Get up! Come dance with me. [Meltem laughs] -[Servet] Whoo! -[Aslı] Ohh… -[laughing] -[Servet] Aslı! -I'm okay. I'm okay. -Whoo! -Okay, that's a lot. -[Servet chuckling] Get it, get it, get it, get it! Yep! -Mmm! -[chuckles] [groans] [grunting] Yeah! [laughs] -[Kerem] People, how are we doing? -Stop! Should we sit? -I'll show you something. -[Meltem] Whoo! No! I don't want to. I'm okay. [Meltem groans] Okay, okay. Easy. Oh! -Mmm! -Oh, forget it. -Let's go. -And go where? It's either A or B. Spend your evening carring Mr. Servet and Meltem around, or come with me. B. I bet you're not used to places like this. You know, where you don't know the waiter and all. It's probably overwhelming. [laughing] What? Look who's here! Wait! Wait! Don't move! Oopsie. I guess I spoke too soon. My gosh, you have a secret place in every city to impress the ladies. Super! [man] There he is! -My man! -[Kerem] Hey! [man laughing] Come here! Welcome. -[Kerem] Thanks. How are you? -Good, good, thanks. -And you? -Really good. [man] You're always busy when I call. -{Kerem] Aah… -[man] So you finally got away? [laughs] Don't hold it against me, -but I am here working. -[laughs] -[Kerem] No joke! -[man] It's okay. As long as you're here. -Welcome! [laughs] -Oh! Uh, I'd like you to meet Aslı. Semih. Semih, Aslı. -Ah, hello. Welcome. -Uh… You'll have to forgive me. Kerem always comes here alone. I mean, that's why I didn't think you were with him. -Welcome. [chuckles] -The pleasure's all mine. Me too. Hold on, I'll tell Sevinç. -Oh, yeah, please! -Sevinç! -Come see who's here. -Kerem-- Keep this between us. What's that? I was a little judgmental towards you, okay? Maybe we make a deal. The friction, bickering, prejudice… whatever's going on with us, let's drop it for tonight. -Welcome, stranger! -Sevinç! Come here. -I missed you. -I missed you too. [Sevinç] Handsome! Who is this? -I'm Sevinç. -I'm Aslı. Nice to meet you. -[Kerem] How's work? -[Semih] Fine! Better now that you're here. Enough standing around. Come on, let's go into the garden. All right? This place really is amazing. Kerem was born here, you know. -What? You're from here? -Mm-hm. I grew up here, until I left for college. -Here? -Be my guest. [Aslı and Semih chuckle] So, what's been goin' on? Sevinç goes nonstop. [chuckles] [Sevinç] Let's see if you recognize this handsome guy. -Hurry, before he stops me. -[Kerem chuckles] -Kerem, is this you? -Mm-hm. [Aslı laughs] Look at you. Uh, who's that with you? My dad. Two years before he died. Right? -I'm sorry. -It's okay. And your mom, is she still alive? I'm going to get something to drink. -I said something wrong? -[Sevinç] Not wrong. But let's just say it's a sensitive subject. [sighs] I'll check on Kerem. She's no longer with us, his mother? She's alive, but she left Kerem and his father when he was ten. -Just a baby. -Yeah. I always tell Semih that it's the reason he never gets close to anyone. He has to find his mother and forgive her. I always said that's his biggest obstacle to love. Until you came along! So I guess I was wrong. You are a miracle. [laughs] -Ah! -Yeah! -Oh. Uh-uh. -[laughing] So you thought that… Uh, hold on, wait. Karem and me aren't together. Honestly. I'll play along. If you say so. -[laughing] -I swear! You don't believe me? [gasps softly] You know what this is? A tear vase. In the past, when they were away from their loved ones, women used to collect their tears and pour them into this vase. They believed that the more tears they collected, the greater their husband's love would be when they returned. I made this. It's yours. You know how to make pottery, then? Here, you can't get a girl if you don't make pottery. Ah, so this is just another trick you learned to get the ladies. [laughs] My father taught me, and his father taught him. Wanna make something? Of course I want to! You have to press it first. A little harder. Let's add a little more water. [Aslı] Is this right? You must be patient. [Aslı laughs] Press here with both thumbs. That's right. You're clearing away extra clay. [gasps] I can tell that you're really good. I'm afraid I'm gonna ruin it. You can finish it. [sighs] It's almost morning. Well, Aslı… there's only one thing to do at this hour. Yeah? What? [laughs] Karem, what are you doing? -Stop messing around. -Hold on. Trust me. You won't regret it. Kerem, that's enough. Aren't we almost there? We're here. I'm just gonna pick you up real quick. Don't be afraid, okay? -Kerem, would you-- -No, no. Be patient. I promise it's worth it. Yeah, I'm ready. -[both laugh] -Wait right here. -One second, please, and I'll join you. -No problem. [screams] What is going on? -[laughs] -Aah! I don't want this any more! -It's goin' on. Don't worry. -Aah! -Kerem! No, no, no! This joke isn't funny! -Stop! -It's not a joke, I swear. -Please stop! It's gonna be great. It's awesome. Trust me. Kerem, something is going on! -I am really scared! -[Kerem] All right. -Nothing to be scared of. -[Aslı] Please! I'm so worried. -No, no. All right. -Please! -I need you to relax. -Wait-- Keep your eyes closed. Are we in a balloon right now? [screams] -Oh my God! It is a balloon! -Whoa! -I-- I gotta get out! -Calm down, calm down. -Stop. Wait! -[Aslı] Put this down! -[Kerem] What are you-- Stop! -[Aslı] Put this down! I'm dizzy! -Calm down! -I have to get off! -I have to get off! -Calm down. Wait. -What are you doing? -[screams] -Will you calm down? -No, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna-- I'm gonna pass-- -Oh, you're passing out. Calm down! -I feel horrible! -[Aslı] I have a fear of heights! -[Kerem] You're afraid of heights? -I am not okay! -Aslı-- -I am not okay! -Hold on! Look at me. -I am not okay! -Relax! You got on a plane! You never showed it there. Because I always take a pill before! Relaxant. I need to get down. Right now! -[screams] -[Kerem] Aslı, calm down. Calm down. -I'm going to pass out. -Whoa, whoa. -Why would you do this to me? -Wait-- No, no. Stop. Stop! [screams] [Kerem] Okay. Aslı. Look at me. Look at me. -[gasps] -Aslı, will you help me help you? -Close your eyes. -[wails] -I just need you to try. -I'm up here because you said close them! Just pretend we're not up here. -Breathe! Aslı… -[screams] Close your eyes. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. -[panting] -Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close them. Just breathe now. -[flame roars] -[gasps] Sh, sh. Forget you're even here. That's it. -You're okay. -[gasps] Calm down. Everything's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. Yeah. Nothing's gonna happen. You got this. Come on. [gasps] Now, slowly open your eyes. -That's it. Shh. -[gasps] Not so bad, huh? It's beautiful. [birdsong] [rooster crows] -Um, I… -I… [chuckles] -You go first. -No, please. You go first. Thank you, Kerem. It was a beautiful night. Though my fear of heights was on display… [both laugh] It was lovely. Really. Good evening-- Uh, yes, it's good morning by now. Maybe we should get some rest. Sleep tight. You as well. [exhales] [sighs] What's up with me? The moment you knock on that door, you're done. No. Get it together, Aslı. What are you doing? [Servet] Ah! Oh… Mmm, mmm… Mwah! Aslı, my dear, again, thank you so much for coming. We'll sign the documents in a few days. The company is entrusted to my daughter. And to you. Young man, you got the job because of her. Tell your boss I want to work with you. Aah! [boats' horns blowing] Bro, a father and daughter freak show. You serious? It was so hard to ditch 'em. -Anyway, we got the job. -[Tuna laughs] What's up with him? What's so funny? I was laughing at this douchebag called Mr. K. Mr. what? Huh? Mr. K. There's a girl writing this Love Tactics blog. -You know? -Mmm? She makes Mr. K fall in love with her using these strategies. She writes every day. Poor bastard doesn't even know what's going on. -Dumbass. -[Tuna] Big time. He's trying the cheesiest moves just to get her. He's so pretentious. He acts like he's a player or something. He thinks he's in charge, but she's playing him and he's clueless. Read up and do the opposite of him, man. Hey, Emir, I don't know if you may have noticed, but… Kerem hasn't touched a girl since he started hanging out with Aslı. Exactly. That means that he can live without sex like every normal human being. What are you talking about? I'm busy now. You always made time for that in the past. Once, you had sex during lunch break. If I didn't know you better, I'd think you were in love with her. [Aslı] Mr. K surprised me quite a bit. It was the first time I saw him as someone other than his womanizer self. He's not so bad when he drops the act. [message alert] [woman 1] What, did you fall in love? I thought he's supposed to fall for you. [message alert] [Kerem] If you're free, how about dinner tomorrow night? [woman 1] What, did you fall in love? I thought he's supposed to fall for you. [Aslı] I just got a message from Mr. K. He wants to meet tomorrow night. But unlike most of you, I didn't reply right away. He even saw that I read his message. These types of guys make it a matter of pride to steal your heart once they see you're different. So I will wait at least an hour to reply. [sighs] [message alert] [woman 2] I could never resist like that. I admire you! [Aslı] We are going to resist, girls. [sighs] No. I can't resist. ALL RIGHT [Kerem] Come by my place at seven o'clock. I'm cooking. His place? [Aslı] Okay. [doorbell rings] Welcome. Thank you. Come in. I need to check on dinner. Please, make yourself at home. I'm good. He's beautiful, his house is beautiful, and on top of that, he cooks. [exhales] How many ladies were here before me? I wonder who went home… and who stayed the night. Tonight's the night, girls. The night we have our first kiss. And then he'll be one step closer to opening up to me. Everything is really delicious. Mm. Thanks again. Mmm. My pleasure. Mmm… Enjoy. That is very kind. It's all right. It's all right. The game is on. [message alert] This is getting ridiculous. They keep asking me for updates. Gah! The first kiss is very important. It's best not to make the first move. They're men, right? They latch onto your lips at the first opportunity. Why won't he make a move? Another glass? Sure. -Mm-- -Phew! -Whew! -[chuckles] [snorts] Come with me. -Make yourself comfortable. -I'll just sit over here. [pouring] -[bleep] -[music plays] Something tells me you like this movie. Am I wrong? It's my favorite film. Watch it with me this time. Ah-- I got it. [heavy rainfall on film soundtrack] [horn honks] [music swells] [gasps] -I just couldn't leave anything to chance. -This is so amazing!

[chuckling] That's enough. All right? Okay. Come on. [laughs] Hey, uh, Kerem? -Kerem? Kerem? -Mmm? Uh… Do you do this to all the girls? Hm? You sleep with them in here? What? What girls? Sleep with who in here? Aslı, what's goin' on? Tell me a secret no other girl knows. Something just between us. [sighs] The piano downstairs was my mother's. She taught me to play. No one has touched that piano since she left. Not me, not anyone. I swear, it's the truth. Really? Nobody? Nobody. I can't throw it out, or play it. If I throw it out, it feels like I'm letting go of my mom or something. And it kind of feels like… I forgive her if I play it. [Kerem sighs] [both chuckle] [soundtrack plays over dialogue] [piano playing "Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven] [playing slowly] [friend 1] So, tell us! What happened? Why don't I have any sane friends? You think we're the only ones waiting? Mr. K was the trending topic last night. Half of the women in Turkey are wondering whether you kissed or not. And whether you made him fall in love. [friend 1] So what happened? Nothing happened. She came over for dinner. That's about it. Wait a minute. So a woman came over, and somehow, she went home later that night without anything even happening, is that right? Yo. Of course! Unbelievable! Spill it! Did he end up kissing you? [all gasp and laugh] Why don't you write about it? Your followers have been waiting since last night. 'Cause, girls… Uh… I don't wanna do this anymore. What do you mean, you don't want to? What are you talking about? You've come this far. Why are you talking like this all of a sudden? I don't get it. But I do. You're in love with him!! [yells] You fell in love with her! [whispers] You fell in love with her. He fell in love with her. I won the bet. The account is mine! The account is mine! [friend 1] It's true! She did! Oh my God. You did? Don't hold out on us. Is there a pic? Of the guy who stole your heart? Of course there is. Here, let me show you. Hmm… There. Hande, what's wrong? It's just… This is the bastard that I was telling you about. That-- that's the same guy? Hande, what are you saying? Aslı, that's him. Sorry. But how could I let him play me like that? I was beating myself up for not telling the truth to him. I am such an idiot. My God! I am such an idiot! You didn't know about it. Don't be so hard on yourself. Hande. I'm so sorry. And to think that I was giving you advice. As if I could teach you about how to handle men. I mean, this is poetic justice. I was handing out advice like I was an expert on it. What am I gonna say now? There's nothing to say. Maybe we were destined to be conned by the same man. I'll show him. No one should be allowed to play with us or our feelings like that. I mean, he will pay for what he did this time. [water splashing gently] [boat horn blares] You're so beautiful. I'm so glad you called. If you hadn't, I would've. -Honestly. -Hello. Welcome. [Kerem] Thank you. You all right? Yeah. Everything's wonderful. Why? LOVE TACTICS - STREAMING You seem a little different. -Is it about last night? -Oh, no, it isn't. No. Because if it is, and you're wondering if I'm thinking about you and me as a fling, or if what I feel about you is something real… It's something real. Look. I've never been in love. I didn't believe in it because I never felt it. I believed love was a made-up thing. I admit… -[horn blares] -…I was wrong. I'm feeling things right now that I've never felt before. -Yeah. -Yeah. [Kerem] And I don't want it to end. [vibrating] I fell in love with you, Aslı. I'm yours, if you'll have me. Say something. I… [laughs] Of course I will. So, I want to say I'm really happy that you confessed your love to me. But that was my goal. To get you to fall in love with me. What do you mean? Uh… what? This was a game. I'm playing you. I wanted to show you and douchebags like you what it would feel like to have your heart broken. From the beginning? It was… Everything was a lie? I've seen guys like you before. You and your stupid scorecard of all the girls you conquer. With each score, you are making someone's heart break. While you were showing off to your friends, all the women that you hurt were crying with each other. So I made you an example. I shared it on my blog, so that all the heartless people like you might learn a lesson. Even now, thousands of followers are watching you declare your love. My lovely followers, here is the infamous Mr. K. Just like I promised you, he has fallen for me. My work here is done. That's it. I can't sit here for another second. But… Aslı… -Oh my God! Look at him! -Oh my God! Check this out! I can't believe it. -Oh my gosh! -[laughing] Wait, what? I'm sorry, Aslı. -But then why would you fire me? -Let's say it was necessary. So it's that simple, huh? How about the years I have given to the brand? It is my life. Are you just gonna throw me out without explaining this? Aslı, it's not good for either of us to keep discussing this. [scoffs] [sniffles] [doorbell rings] Can I come in? A horse? [scoffs] Meltem, I really don't-- It'll just take five minutes of your time. Honestly, it caught me by surprise. That you could fall in love. Anyway, now that you've given your love away, you can fall in love with me. [sighs] I'll make a deal with you, Kerem. You don't wanna be here anymore. Let's go to London. It'll be good for you to get away from here. And when we come back, we'll start fresh and build from there. Hmm? If you've said your piece, Meltem, I'd like to be alone now. See, I would do anything to help you leave her behind. It hurts me to see you like this. Besides, I promise she's gonna regret what she did to you. Now she doesn't have a job. That's a good start. She was fired? Of course. I gave the order myself. Someone had to make her pay for what she did to you. [sighs] [breathing shakily] [Aslı] Dear followers, you know that I shut down my blog page, but I wanted to share one last post. Hold on. Did I hear that right? You want me to come back to work for you? [Hakan] Yes, exactly. I'd rather not come back. Uh-- What are you all doing here? -We need to talk to you. -Is something wrong? -Mm-hm. -Did you get your job back? Well, yeah, they offered me my old job, but I won't do it. Wait. How would you know? Because of Kerem. When he heard that Meltem had you fired, he agreed to go to London with her, on the condition that you got your job back. Aren't you going to do something? Don't you see? He really does love you. Come on! More importantly, you love him too. I don't care about him. I never did. -Yeah, but-- -I'm happy, I promise. I want you to be happy too. Ladies, sorry for interrupting, but his plane leaves in two hours. Go on. [bleep] -[Tuna] The call won't go through. -We're sorry. The person you are calling… -His phone's off. -…is not available… [Cansu] Ezgi, Ezgi, hold on! Me first. [all panting] It's so romantic, right? It's just like a dream. -If it gets more romantic, I'll cry. -[engine starts] -Comfortable? [giggles] -Never been better. [Cansu and Ezgi laugh] INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURES All right, let's go. Excuse me. Could you please let us through? We're kind of in a hurry. If we let everyone in a hurry through, we'd never get the truck unloaded. -Go on, one by one. -Great. We'll never make it. Listen, guys. It's a matter of life and death. We're going to reunite lovers. [laughs] If they're really in love, then one day, they'll reunite. -Huh? Hold tight! [laughs] -Sir, maybe you should pull over and let us go, instead of spouting your words of wisdom? Lady, we're not moving. Be patient. You'll live. Excuse me? You're the lady, pal! You soulless, heartless bastard! I swear, I'll shove damn things you unloaded up your ass! I'll rail you with those boards, you mother-- [bleep]! [bleep] [long bleep] [bleep fading] You have a lovely day. Go on. We appreciate it! Thanks so much! Sweetie, tell Emir we need to get going. Emir. Emir! -Come on. -[starts engine] [woman on PA] …Airlines. Passengers on flight 1541 to Düsseldorf are kindly requested to proceed to passport control. [horn blares] This traffic's horrible. -So, should we have taken the TEM? -It's blocked too. Were you able to get him? -I still can't reach him. -So what are we gonna do now? It's taking too long! [gasps] -Thank you so much. -I hope you get there before it leaves. -Pray! -Of course. Excuse me! Have a good day! -[chuckles] -[man] Thank you. [man] Please get in line with your laptops and tablets open. I'm at the airport. How much time do I have? [Ezgi] They're probably boarding now. You won't get to the gate in time. -Are you kidding me? -Hold on. Listen. Cansu got you a ticket. You're checked in. And she just emailed you the info. -Get to the gate. -You're the best! Unbelievable! Thank you so much. I will call you right back. Sorry! Sorry, excuse me, my plane is boarding. Uh, could I move forward? Excuse me. Thank you so much. Ah! They say that common decency is still alive and well. I almost didn't believe it, but now, I agree. Thank you. Safe travels, everyone. Thanks a lot. -Wow! -[murmuring] Ooh! Yeah. It's him. -[whispering] Are those… -Welcome. Have nice trip, Mr. K. Have a nice trip. Welcome. Here you go. Have a nice trip. [gasping] Pardon. Uh, I'm so sorry. [announcement in Turkish] [Meltem] Ugh, look. [woman on PA] Passengers, welcome on board. [woman] By the way, Love Tactics shared a new post. -Apparently, it's really good. -I have to read it before we take off. [announcement in Turkish] Dear passengers, the seat belt sign will be switched on shortly. [snorts] …keep your seat belt fastened at all times… LOVE TACTICS [Aslı] Dear followers, you know that I shut down my blog, but I wanted to share one last post. I have a confession to make. I love Mr. K. I mean, Kerem. Despite the journey I've shared, I love him and regret what I did. Maybe you think he deserved it, maybe he broke a lot of women's hearts, but who doesn't make mistakes? Did that make what I did right? What was so wrong about our story? That he fell in love with me? I broke his heart. But more importantly, I turned down the only opportunity for happiness in my life out of spite and a false sense of pride. I ended a story that could have been beautiful before it even started. Now, if I had the guts to do so, I would go up to him and apologize. He would never forgive me, but if I was brave, or had a sliver of hope, I would have dropped everything and run to him. I'm writing this because I don't want you to make the same mistake as me. If you have the slightest chance of finding love, don't be afraid, and don't let the person you love go. Remember, true love only comes once. If you're worried about knowing when it arrives, don't. You'll know. Your heart will tell you. Mine did. I'm here. I'm here. No, no, no, no! Stop, stop, stop, please! I made it. Kerem? Where are you going? I need to get on. You have to let me board. Please. -Ma'am, it's not possible. -Okay… -All the passengers have boarded. -Yes, but here's my boarding pass. Keep the door open, would you, please? Kerem, come here now. You're making a mistake. Uh, this one is for the next flight. What? It's the wrong boarding pass? Oh, Cansu! Please. I need your help. I have to get on this plane now. I will do anything. I'm begging you, I need to get off, now. Sorry, sir. We're headed to the runway for takeoff. Please take your seat. You can't force me to stay on the plane, correct? Look, if you keep doing this, I'll have to report you to airport security. Please, report me to whoever you want. Please stop, sir. Uh, call security now. Can't you please let me go? I am begging you. Let me go! -I have to. Please excuse me. Okay! -Ma'am, please stop! Okay, bye! [gasps] Aslı? Kerem? -My-- -My-- [both chuckle] I don't want you to go. Why's that? You just can't leave now. Because my tears won't fit in this vase. I love you, Kerem. Come here. [man] Mr. Kerem. Mr. Kerem! POLICE Uh… -We'll pick this up after I'm released. -Oh! Before we get separated, I wanna tell you that I'm sorry. Me too. I never told you that when I met you, -the guys and I-- -You made a bet with the boys. I know. But we're perfect for each other. [laughs] Remember the man you would chase onto a plane? I thought you said he wasn't born. You can't believe everything women say. -Cliché. -[laughs] I want all the clichés with you. Me too.
