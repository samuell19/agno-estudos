Set that way. I'll slit the old bastard's throat myself. Traitors. Death? Let me live. I cannot grant you life. But I may yet save your crown. Come, make compact with me and we will reverse ill-fortune. Death is no deal maker. Who are you? Why name is Legion, for we are many. Now King, make your choice. No, Blake. We have to find another way. Does there look like there's another way? We move on. Drink some water. We're not gonna last much longer out here if we don't find something soon. What? What is it? Keep moving! Aw, get back! Get back! Shit! Jacob! Jacob! Crazy, he interviewed and photographed over 30 churches and none of 'em had websites, so super old school. Very good, I know I couldn't do it. Have you and Andrew talked today? Not yet, but he should be home any minute. Wow, that's way too long. Two months is entirely too long. Oh, and he's bringing home guests, so yay, I get to entertain. He's been gone for months and he's bringing company home, who? Some people from one of the churches that he met in Arkansas. Huh. I don't know, he didn't say much about 'em. Oh, and he just pulled up. Oh, good luck. I'll talk to you tomorrow, sis. - Hey. - Hi. And how's baby Evan doing? Daddy missed you. Oh, babe I'd like you to meet a couple of friends I met along this journey. This is Jacoby. Hi. Pleasure. And this is Benjamin. How do you do, ma'am? It's a pleasure to meet you both. Hope you're hungry. Are you guys thirsty? We have beer, Scotch, wine. Water will do. Where are you guys from? This journey is not about our hunger. The company we provide for one another. The safety of you and your future child is what we crave. Let's eat. Excuse me. Don't be scared, Mary. It's still your hubby in here. Andrew was the catalyst I needed to be reborn. And baby Evan will be my portal to walk this earth in infant form. Adramelech will finally be free. This gonna be great. Stop it! Please, let me go! Please don't, no! Yeah, 5:00 a.m. and don't be late. And coast the van down the drive. And no headlights. There James rose unto you. I come to thee, I require thee, and I charge thee. By thy christened and thy takest leave of the Lord Raphael and now I raise and then asked of you this night to come and tell me truly of the treasure that lieth here in this place. Taking up gardening? The original will, if we can find it... Give it up, Becks. We've turned the place upside dow. If there was another will, the bastard's taken it to the grave. It wasn't in the coffin then. No, but I have a plan. You've gone too far with this satanic bullshit. You're not a teenage goth anymore, Becks. So what do you want me to do? Steal the family valuables and hope that nobody notices? Oh that will end well, won't it? Mm-hmm. Will that be all, sir? Miss? Thank you, Charles. Very well. I shall bid you good night. Busy day tomorrow. This is your brilliant plan? Yes. Lindenbacks, earth from the head of the dead man. Wheresoever thou liest or sleepest, that night he will come and speak truly. Really? He will come. I hated him when he was alive, I don't want him back. I'd love to see the sadistic bastard burning in hell. Leaving my inheritance to my that. And you, you have lost the plot. So what do you want me to do? Put on a ball of cloth and join Peter, the gentleman thief, and have a way with the family jewels in a transit van? I'll take whatever I can. It's my birthright. And I'm not letting the bloody help take that too. What are you doing? Richard. I burn in hell. You come see. Bewarest lest thee dead man was not of goodly christened, for he at last with the lord of Hades. Then thouest call will be heard by the demon heart and not one of those shall he have dispatched to drag the caller to the fiery depths. Another gruesome scene was identified by Jokers in the early hours of this morning. Police are not confirming if these killings were done by the same person or persons. Police warn residents to stay inside, be aware, and be safe. There. In the early hours of the morning, a body of a homeless man was discovered in a pattern victim of the killer, that some are calling the demon of the woods. Rebecca. It is Rebecca? Huh, you're surprised to see me. It would be in your favor to communicate with me. Do you recognize me? I can't say that I do. I know what you've been up to. I've seen you on this journey before. I think you're mistaken, sir... Please Rebecca, let's not play the same tired misconception. You know we all be on fantasy here. All right, you know who I am, what is it you want? Back and forth, back and forth. I've watched you, I've watched all of you. Little spies, we warned you. Whatever it is that you want. Back and forth, to and fro. You're not going to get them! This is my train, get out! Silly girl, we're not interested in your petty objectives. The insignificant scropling of your so-called nature. This may be your train, Rebecca, but we're hitching a ride. And our goal is its destination. How many of you are there? The consequence of dabbling in realms you don't understand, infantile fools. We warned you! If you abuse our realm, we will return the favor. This journey, this whimsical illusion of yours may only last a mere blink of an eye in your world, but when it's done, we will control what's behind that eye. No, I won't let you. You will be our gateway, Rebecca. And then you humans will know a true hell on earth. I believe this is our stop. Something's wrong. No. Is she back? Does she have the information? This isn't right. Doctor, did she complete the mission? Activating alarm system. Oh shit. Answer me! Remote viewing is a dangerous process, General. If you want more control, then use real spies, not psychic ones. General, wait! No, get it out! Get it out, get it out! Rebecca, calm down. Did you get the information requested? The information is insignificant. That's not your call, young lady. We were told, we should have listened. You should have listened! Now they're here. Who's here? This is it. We can't go in here. This is Eli's house. Seriously, that's just some story the older kids told the younger ones to scare the crap out of 'em. No, it's true. He's real, I saw him when I was eight. He was looking at me right through that window. According to the story if you saw him, you'd be dead, right? I can't go in there. You are if you wanna get paid. Haven't you heard what happens when you go inside? Yeah, you get paid. You wanna make some money tonight? Obviously, that's why I came. Then lose the attitude. Let's go. Okay, maybe I didn't see his face, but I definitely saw someone or something looking through that window. Jenny, no one's lived here in over 50 years. The city maintains this place for historical purposes. They say the couple that own this house, hardly ever left it. They were super religious and had a daughter. An only child who they kept locked up in here with them. So one night, out of sheer loneliness, the little girl prayed for a friend to play with. She named him Eli. The demon ended up killing both of her parents and eventually the little girl too. Shh, you hear something? I don't hear anything. 'Cause no one lives here. Stop trying to creep me out and let's find the good stuff. It's empty. You know, a lot of these old houses have floor safes, like that one over in Denison. The one with the coin collection? Yeah, you missed a good haul that night. I think we should get outta here, Bill. Bill? Bill? So, this drawing, courtesy of Woking Library shows the tree where Catherine Davis, aka the Demon Maid was hung. A local legend, or is it? Lo and behold, we have found it. Just take the photo. What? Take the photo. This is my rather unglamorous assistant Tom. He is helping me make this documentary. Documentary? Tom is a history nerd, which means he normally gets turned on by stuff like this. Trees, sexy. Tom. What? What's that? Ow. You fucktard. Come on let's go, you've seen it. Not exactly. The tree's there. Yeah, but we haven't seen her. You walk around the tree three times and either she appears or the demon that possesses her. Or both. I don't want to see either. (laughs} Oh come on. Look, when I said I wanted to go for a nice walk in the forest, I did not mean round a demon tree. And this is why Tom's a pussy. You all right? Tom? Whoa, jumpy. You ready to prove me wrong? Remember, three times around and don't forget to introduce yourself to her. Good man, let's go. Ha. Moment of truth now. Tom, oh for God's sake. Tom, you're ruining her big moment. Oh really funny. So, we have gone from making a documentary to playing hide and seek with Tom. Let's go find the fucker. Tom, Tom are you trying to be center of attention or something? Tom, whoa. What the hell? Well, I'm gonna see you back at the car. Tom, get down! Cut me down, Ant. KPBI News, top of the hour. The search for missing cryptozoologist, Arthur Showgras, continues into its third month with no end in sight. Mr. Shawcross went missing in the woods of Bloodfang to find a rumored hidden area known as the Slaughtering Ground. October 21st, we're heading out to the Slaughtering Grounds. Hopefully Arthur's there. Taught me everything I knew. We'll find him babe, it's okay. Andrea and I are heading over to the Slaughtering Grounds. We heard from the chief back in Bloodfang that it's about five miles north from the river from here. Even though the bartender said it was 10 miles south of the river, Sam, south. Look, the chief said he's been to the Slaughtering Grounds before. I don't give a fuck, he's a drunk. Yeah, ooh. We'll find him, we'll find him okay. I know he was the biggest kook ever. I swear to God I loved him though. Wait, Andrea. Sam, what? - What's that? - Stop. - No, come on. - What. Over here, quick. Hang on, hang on. Fuck. Is that? It says. Hang on, is that? That's not Arthur's is it? This is Arthur's journal, it is. You know with, wait Sam, Sam, Sam, you don't think that he's like... Hang on, hang on. Well, we know where we're going. Sam, what is this we shit? No! You know what, you're right. You remember your way back to the car right? If the wendigo does not kill you, I swear to God I will. Come on. Thank you, love you. Welcome to "Cryptozoology Today." I'm Arthur Shawcross and today we're going out to the Slaughtering Grounds and find ourselves a wendigo. For those of you that don't know, the local legend says that the wendigo is an evil sprit that possesses man and turns him into cannibals. And if I can go out there and prove that these murders were committed by a wendigo, and bring back real evidence, I'll be famous. Arthur Shawcross. After much persuasion, we decided to take up camp. Now Andrea's gone, taking the world's longest piss. I'm stumbling around here out in the dark. Don't worry, I got my little friend right here. Don't tell Andrea that. Andrea! Andrea! Oh Jesus, fuck. Andrea! Where is she? Oh Jesus fucking Christ! Andrea! What the fuck, what the fuck! Let go of her, you motherfucker! Hey! Oh Jesus, oh God, it's okay, it's okay. Oh my god, what happened? Oh Jesus, fuck. It's okay, it's okay, you're okay, you're okay? Holy shit, okay! Back the fuck up, back the fuck! Arthur, Arthur, is that you? Please, please stop, whatever shit I've told you. You can beat this. Andrea's hurt, help me. Help me, goddammit. Clive? Clive, Clive mate, what's wrong? Clive, Clive, hey Clive. All right, all right. Should I call someone? Don't, no, no, no thanks. I'm okay. So, when are you coming to see me? Soon. Liar, how's your new housemate? Yeah, he's good. He's neat, he's tidy. He's there, isn't he? Hang on. He did something weird last night. That money was to get you down to see me. I'm coming down this weekend, I promise. You fucking liar! We haven't really spoke much, have we? Are you all right? I heard you shouting. It's just a dream. So how you feeling now? Same. What's that? I have a remedy, I swear by it. Clive. Clive. I still hate this place. Help me, thing in the middle. You mean it wasn't a joke? You actually want to go through with this. One more time, properly. You stuck to the rules, on the way. Look, this place is bad, Richard. Everyone in town's seen something. Hell, I've seen something. And I didn't! I want to see him with my own eyes. And I want to hear him speak. You're a girl. Look, I'm not taking care of you if you're gonna go crazy. Shall we? Now remember... Yeah, yeah, don't look away. And don't turn your back. Turn this church upside down, raise him up, pillars down. Turn this church upside down. Raise him up, pillars down. Ooh, I need a drink. Don't move. Keep your eyes on it. No! Richard! Come on, please. Come on. Speak or burn. I just want to free my, I just want to free my... All right, take it off then. Mom, Dad what are you? Maggie. Joe, we're sorry. I know we should have called, but we'd no way of contacting you. Oh Jesus mOm, I'm uncontactable because I don't want to be contacted. There's a reason I don't want to be contacted, okay. Who the fuck are they? Hello Joe, I'm Father Emmet. Your parents and Maggie asked me to speak with you. A priest, a fucking priest. Go worry about your cares and leave me alone. You can just forget I exist, go on. Why am I tied to this chair, where I need my own house. Please just go, come on. Fucking just bought this shit. Get me out of... Yo, that was so good. They are loving this shit, we are getting love hearts and everything Father. Was that really necessary? Make sure he's restrained properly. You know how strong they are. They, it's just Joe. They, the demons. For they are Legion. Yo, that was so fucking badass. Can we please just concentrate on Joe. Show time. Are we live? Three, two, one, and go. Hello, my faithful followers. I am Father Emmet. Here we have the possessed and now we'll begin this ritual. Maggie, what is this? What, oh, oh. Note, holy water, no effect. Joe Carver, you have been possessed by a demon and by the life and mercy of God, you will be released tonight from your torment. What the fuck you on about? You're not yourself, Joe. Your parents have called on me, the world renown Father Emmet, to release you from this affliction. Possessed. Maggie, come on lady. I'm just a bad fucking guy all right. I'm a junkie. . it's not like that son. We spoke to the other lads, they told us what happened. Told you what, huh? Told you that we got drunk and we went down to the cave and I got knocked out, is that it? They examined the ruins in the cave, Joe. Ancient Gaelic, an invocation to summon the Morrigan. You we're never the same afterwards, Joe. You fucking fools. I broke my back, I got addicted to heroin to heal the pain, all right. I left your fucking lives 'cause I didn't want to see any of you ever again. Can you not get that through your thick fucking skulls. Maggie, I never loved you all right, never loved you! Now get the fuck outta this room. Get the. Oh fuck. The prism worked. It's a pagan spirit. Father. What is it, I'm trying to perform an exorcism? Dad, no! You don't need her, you have me now. You don't need anyone. Then again. Run, Maggie. Maggie, go! Joe, I love you! Go! Joe. Are you fucking serious? I don't even know Christine, I met her at some stupid party for like two seconds, then she added me on Facebook. I have no idea who she is. That's not what she said in those messages. She's lying. I just don't know if I can trust you anymore, Allen. I'm sorry, but I think we should take a break. Yeah, let's make it a long one, you snake ass bitch, fuck you. Hey, are you okay? You poor kid. I think you need this more than I do. Take it, it'll bring you good luck. What the hell is it? It's a old heirloom, passed down from my family in Romania. Brought me great fortune. It'll help you too. Might even help you get that girlfriend back. You don't even know who I am. If this thing is so wonderful, why would you just give it away to a stranger? 'Cause I don't need it anymore. So I thought I would pass it on. You have to give to get. Just consider it my good deed for the day. Okay, well thanks. Have a good day. I will. Allen, it's me. Hey. Can we talk? Yeah, come in. I just want to apologize for earlier today. I know you'd never cheat on me. I just got insecure because of all those stupid messages. I was wrong, I want to make it up to you. Come here. Allen, what are you doing? Allen! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? That's what my son probably used to say before you drove him to suicide? I never did that to anyone. You're crazy! You and your friends in high school used to bully him unmercifully. His name was Ivan. You called him a retarded piece of shit, an albino faggot. A fucking loser and all he wanted was a friend. Just one friend who would be nice to him. And when he couldn't find it, he decided he just couldn't do it anymore. The emotional wounds you inflicted on him never healed and a year ago he killed himself. In his suicide note, he mentioned your name amongst the boys who were mean to him. So, I made a pact with the devil. If I gave him your soul, he would bring Ivan back from the dead. You shouldn't fuck around with a mother who knows black magic. Ivan, you can come out now. Mother, is this Allen? He is, we must do to him what we've done to so many others. We must make him pay. That was a long time ago, I was just a kid! You must die! Come on Ivan, we've got to go now. We don't want to keep him waiting. No more killing, no more killing. Yeah, you're gonna be alive again. You're gonna lead a normal life. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. Get away. Get that wound. You! I don't answer from you. Ask us, ask us. Just leave me be! Get away from him, leave him alone! Why are you showing me this? Ask us, ask us. I quit. Kara, Kara, Kara! We see what lies ahead. Ask us, ask us. What is to come? Your lover, your wife, she will die. You're lying! Why would you say this? You will kill her. I would never hut her, never! Who is he? I'll kill him! You must see, you must see. Gives herself to give. She betrays her sacred vow. She would never do this to me, never! I love her, I love her. Calum, look at me, please look at me. You, this is all your doing. Try to turn me against my wife. I'll fucking kill ya! Why? Calum. Yeah, it's the best, man. Yep. Thank you man, you got the best stuff. That shit. Yeah. Oscar'll scare anything. Come on, Oscar. What's got him so spooked? Oscar! Oh my God! Oscar. No! No, Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! No! We found him! I'm the king now! Oh, what's that noise? What noise? Where is it coming from? I don't hear anything? I'm done! What's that? Why can't you hear it? It's burning!
