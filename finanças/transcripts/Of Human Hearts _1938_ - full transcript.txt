What you pulling the bell for, Elder Massey? Howdy, Mr. Inchpin. What is it? Fire? Steamboat's a-coming. Wow. Only 4 days late this month. - New preacher's on that boat. - New preacher? Yep. I'll race you down to the landing. Hey, pop! The steamboat's a-coming. Steamboat's a-coming! Hey, steamboat's a-coming! Steamboat's a-coming! Steamboat's a-coming! Steamboat's a-coming! Mrs. Andsley! Mrs. Andsley! The boat's a-coming. The boat's a-coming! Thanks, Grace. Mrs. Allum! Oh, Mrs. Allum! What is it? The boat's a-coming! Reverend Wilkins? I'm Elder Massey. How do you do, sir? This is Mrs. Wilkins. Mrs. Wilkins. My son Jason. Howdy, son. The folks are all waitin' for you. I'm Rufus Inchpin, reverend. - Welcome to pine hill. - Thank you, sir. I reckon this looks a lot Wilder to you than Maryland. It is my duty to carry the gospel into the wilderness. This is my call. I answered. Oh, this is George Ames, reverend. - How do you do, Mr. Ames? - Reverend. What's the population here? There they are. Is that all? Got a nice little house all ready for you, reverend. Now, suppose you folks just hop on the wagon with your furniture. I'll have you home in a jiffy. Thank you, Mr. Ames. Come on, my dear. Giddyap! Mom, is this Ohio? Yes, dear. What's that across the river? That's Virginia. Don't you remember your map? Yes, but on the map, Ohio was brown, and Virginia was red. They both look green to me. Well, folks, there's your new home. Giddyap! Whoa! Now here we are, folks. I'll have you bedded down quicker than a cat can lick its chops. Mr. Ames, I didn't see the schoolhouse. We ain't got none, ma'am. The last one we had burned down, so we didn't figure there's much sense in building it up again. We kind of figured too much book-learnin' was bad for children. -Lem? -Yeah? You and Pete help me with this stuff, will you? Alright. Girl: Hello. Hello. Is that your house? Yeah. Is that yours? Uh-huh. What's this? Guess. Oh, I know. Say, this is alright. What's your name? Jason. What's yourn? Annie. Mrs. Wilkins: Jason. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, it doesn't look very inviting, does it, dear? Wait till we get it fixed up. You won't know it. Mother's sideboard will make a big difference, and the paintings, grandmother's teapot, and the Saint Bartholomew candlestick. Well, son. This'll never be as nice as our last place. Now, now. Don't bump against that door. Be careful! There you are. Take it in easy. Excuse me, folks. We're coming in. There. Doesn't it begin to look like home? Windows are awfully dirty. We'll wash those tomorrow, son. They won't clean themselves, son. Mary, there isn't another woman in the whole world that can turn a bare house into a palace as quickly as you can. - It's the furniture. - It's you, dear. And just think, they didn't break a thing. You'd have been pretty cross if they did, I bet you. Not cross, son, but I'd have felt badly. I grew up with this furniture, and I'm attached to it. Sorry to bother you, reverend. Oh, come in, Mr. Inchpin. Come in. Thank you. We was wondering how you were off for money. I was told my finances would be handled by the community. That's right, they will. We kind of figured it might be a good idea to hold a meeting tonight to get you straightened around. I should be happy to attend. We're going to have a donation party. I guess you know what that is. Folks chip in with this and that so as to get you squared away. That's very kind of you. We figured to gather at the meetinghouse about an hour after sundown. Is that alright? Perfectly, and thank you very much, gentlemen. Howdy, son. - Mom. - Yes, dear? What kind of stuff do they give, mom? In a place like this, Jason, everyone is poor. Money is scarce, and the people have to pay the minister the best way they can. If they can't pay him with money, then they give him furniture, food, and clothes. Oh. You mean, we have to wear other people's clothes? Things they don't want anymore? Yes, dear. Pop, too? No, dear. Just you and I. We're not going to like it here, mom. God called your father to this place, Jason. Beulah land, page 64! One verse and one chorus!

You need some air. Folks, this meeting tonight is to acquaint you with our new preacher-- Reverend Ethan Wilkins! Reverend Wilkins has come all the way from Maryland to give us the spiritual guidance we're so much in need of. Reverend Wilkins. Good people, Providence has seen fit to put me down amongst you. From this moment forward, your lives will be my life, your troubles mine, your happiness my own. This meeting has another purpose. This I leave entirely in your hands. Parson Wilkins is referring to money, folks. Now, we sent east for a preacher, and we said we could pay him $400 a year in his keep. But a lot of things have happened lately. We've had a lot of rain, crops is bad, and business is bad. Well, Parson, we might as well come out flat and tell you that if we give you $400 a year, we're not only taking the food out of our own mouths but out of the mouths of our children. He's right. The last loaf of sugar I bought at Mr. Ames' store cost almost more than I could afford. Sister Cantwell, I got to get my profit. I ain't saying you ain't, but just look at the price of short sweetening. Why don't you use long sweetening? Molasses is cheap. I ain't going to be taxed like all get-out to help take care of the preacher. I think he ought to make a new dicker with us-- a fair dicker. Now hold on. A bargain's a bargain. Human beings don't eat grass, and they don't grow their clothes on their backs like horses and cows. I'm ready with my share. Here's a dress I was a-fixin' over for Annie, but I says to myself, "no." I says, "it's my duty to give it to the Parson's wife," and that's just what I'm gonna do. This here's a good dress, too. I ain't had it more than a year. My ma has her dresses made by a dressmaker. Brothers and sisters, I think we ought to do the very best we can towards Parson Wilkins and his family. The very best. I got a lot of confidence in him-- Stop, George. No, I'll be darned if I do. Fair play is the finest Jewel in the, uh... Diadem. Now, folks, hear me out. Then do what you like. I'm for making the Parson a liberal allowance. I say give the Parson $250 a year in cash, notes, produce, and merchandise, the produce and merchandise being due and payable at my store. Now, maybe we've given other preachers more than that, but they've had bigger families. Now, what do you say? - Fine. Fine. How's that, Parson? Fair enough? Well, since we're going to do so wellby the Parson, I guess he won't need them victuals and other things we was fixin' to give him. Oh, yes, he will. I brung a lot of stuff, and I'm donatin' it. Let's have some singin', Elder Massey! Bringing in the sheaves! Page 82! And while we're singin', the congregation can come up the aisle and put their donations in the baskets. Bringing in the sheaves. ♪ Ahhh ♪ ♪ Sowing in the morning ♪ ♪ Sowing seeds of kindness ♪ ♪ Sowing in the noontide ♪ ♪ And the dewy leaves ♪ ♪ Waiting for the harvest ♪ Ahh, I didn't want them, anyway.

Let us pray. Father, we thank thee for the goodness and mercy thou hast put into the hearts of each one of us. Ha ha ha ha ha! Quiet, please. Ha ha ha! Quiet. Why are you laughing? Don't look at me, Parson. It's him. You must remain quiet if you wish to stay here. Both of you. Ha ha ha! Look here, Parson-- Forgive me. Most high, thou hast led our feeble steps to this fair, young city. Thou has put into the hearts and the minds of the people here to feed and clothe me and mine, and we thank thee that thou, in thy infinite wisdom, has given me but one child to feed and one wife to clothe. Amen. Mom! Mom, look what I got. Magazines! Well, isn't that fine? They're the only ones in pine hill. I've been all over, and they're the only ones. Well, you are lucky. Where did you get them? Dr. Shingle. You'll have to take them right back, Jason. Why, mom? Are you mad at Dr. Shingle? What's this I hear about Dr. Shingle? Oh, nothing. He gave Jason some magazines. Yes? What kind? Bon-ton gazettes. I want them returned at once. Aw, pop. I can't take them back. He gave them to me. Very well. I'll take them. Why'd I learn to read if I can't have any books? This is trash. I'll find other books for you. There aren't any others. Dr. Shingle's the only man in this town that reads. Very well. I'll find a book for you. I've read it. Almost know it by heart. Jason. No, Ethan. I will not tolerate insolence. He didn't mean anything. Please. Oh, dear. The stew's boiling over. Go on in and sit down, dear. I'll see that he returns the magazines. I'll see to it myself. Jason, you shouldn't anger your father. Oh, I didn't mean to. Well, go on out in the yard and play. Mom, what's the matter with Dr. Shingle? Oh, never mind. You mean because he's a drunkard? Shh. He plays cards, too. He does? Now, Jim, don't you say a word. Let me do all the talking. I won't say a word, George. You handle the whole thing. I'll get twice as much as he's worth. Alright. Maybe 3 times. Good. - Good evening, Parson. - Good evening, Mr. Ames. Hope I didn't interrupt your supper. No, not at all. What is it? I don't like to disturb a man when he's eating, but knowing you was in the market for a horse... He's not much to look at, Mr. Ames. Neither is an oyster, but it tastes good. All he needs is a little clipping, reverend. He belongs to my friend Mr. Meaker here. You know Jim Meaker. Mr. Meaker. Howdy, reverend. How old is he, Mr. Meaker? 5 years old. He'll be 5 this fall. 5 years old? Well, maybe 6. I could be wrong about a year. You've been imposed upon, Mr. Meaker. This horse is 11 years old. 11? Great balls of fire! Suffers from colic. Spavin, too. And here's a split hoof. Well, well, well, well. - You mean he ain't no good, reverend? - I'm afraid not much, gentlemen. Well, what do you think of that, Jim? You've been stuck again. Yep. It looks like there ain't nobody honest nowadays. Do you gentlemen mind stepping in the house? I'd like to have a little talk with you. I've been thinking about my discourse for next Sunday. Perhaps you gentlemen would like to suggest a subject. Well, I can't think of anything right now, reverend. Now, in Matthew, in the 25th chapter... The 35th verse, we have, "I was a stranger, and you took me in." Now, you remember the quotation, of course. "I was a stranger, and you took me in." Now, you gentlemen misinterpret that phrase. You seem to think it means to take advantage of, to get the best of. Well, I haven't given it much thought, reverend. "I was a stranger, and you took me in." They sheltered him, gave him aid and sustenance in his misery. They shared what they had with him, little as it was. But in helping him, they helped themselves. I'll get you another horse. Now, uh... In Isaiah, the 24th chapter, the 16th verse, we have, "the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously." Yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. I'll get you a Colt this time. Of course, the greatest sermon of all... is do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It carries a beautiful sentiment and nobleness of thought, and besides, the best way to do business. Yes, gentlemen. That will be my sermon for next Sunday-- Do unto others. That's the ticket, Parson. Do unto others. Yes, sirree. Yes, sir. Do unto others... Before they get a chance to do unto you. You're tucked in here mighty nice, Parson. Yes, sir. Mighty nice. Oh ho! Bon-ton gazettes, huh? - You mind if I borrow them, Parson? - You may keep them, Mr. Ames. Oh, no, no, no. Not for good. Well, if you insist. My boy Chauncey will be mighty glad to get these. No. They're mine! Dr. Shingle gave them to me. Jason. But, pop, he's going to give them to his little boy. - Why can't I have them? - That will do. But that's not fair. They're mine! Jason, I shall determine from now on what you will read. Pretty sassy, that boy. Did I tell you children are getting harder and harder to raise every year? He's as good as most boys, I think. - Oh, good evening, sister Wilkins. - Good evening. That's mighty high-class stuff you got there. Look at that, Jim. Solid silver. No. You folks must have been pretty well-off back east. Worldly things, Mr. Meaker. I was thinking of getting some new silverware. Does this stuff come high? It's quite old. We've had it a long time. Well, it sure is fine stuff. Now, Mr. Meaker, if you can find a good horse... I'll get you a bargain this time if I go broke doing it. Now, Jim, don't get yourself all worked up. Good evening, Parson. Goodnight, gentlemen. Do unto others. He's a good man, Jim. A mighty good man. Yeah. He had me kind of ashamed of myself. Well, Jim, you've got a lot to be ashamed of. Me? How about you? From now on, I'm going to give honest value. You mean that? I mean it, Jim. George, I'm proud of you. Ha! George, how much do you want for that Colt of yours? Well, now, let me see. I, uh... Too much. Come on. There, there, son. Don't cry. Why couldn't I have the magazines? Dr. Shingle gave them to me. Well, perhaps they were wrong for little boys. They're alright for Chauncey Ames. Shh. Your father knows best, Jason. You always say that. I know. I'll get you some Harper's monthly. I don't want Harper's.I... Harper's monthlys? Will you, mom? I'll get you a year's subscription. But that'll cost a lot of money. Never mind. I thought we were poor. You said... I'll find the money somewhere. Oh, Harper's monthlys! Say. Gee whillikins! Say, I bet nobody in this town ever saw one of them. Jason. - Good day, sister Wilkins. - Good day, Mr. Ames. A pound of salt, please. A pound of salt? That was a mighty fine sermon last Sunday, sister Wilkins. Yes, sir. Folks was very much took by it. That part about do unto others. Yes, sir. Do unto others. Hmm. Great stuff. If folks would only abide by it. Yeah. Anything else? No, that's all. There you are. Thank you. Oh, Mr. Ames. Yes? Last week, you were interested in my silverware. Well, I've seen finer, of course. Oh, uh... You weren't aiming to sell these, were you? Well, how much did you figure on getting for them? Well, I thought... $4.00. $4.00? Why, Mrs. Wilkins! But they're solid silver. Yeah, I know, but they're just spoons. Old-fashioned ones, at that. Well, how much, then? Well, I tell you what I'll do. I'll give you $2.00 for them. That's twice as much as they're worth, but after all, you are the Parson's wife. Alright, Mr. Ames. There you are. $2.00. May I use the pen? There it is. Hello, Jason. Oh, I was just straightening up your sign. Were you? I wish you could do the same for me. Sir? Let it pass, lad. Let it pass. Come in. Well, I haven't seen you in a long time. I'm not allowed to come here. No, I suppose not. I'm quite a villain. You don't look like a villain. Oh, I'm an awful scoundrel. Why do you wear that thing in your eye? What? Oh, this. It helps me to remember. Like tying a string around your finger? Yes, something like that. When it falls on the floor, you remember. No. When it falls on the floor, it breaks. Oh. Ha ha! Dr. Shingle, are you really a drunkard? Well, I suppose I am, Jason. Yes. Why are you? Why is your father a preacher? Well, because he likes it, I guess. Well, that's why I'm a drunkard. And you play cards. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. And smoke. Mm-hmm. You mustn't do those things, Dr. Shingle. -Why not? -Because it's wrong. Pop says it is, and he knows. Well, we can't all of us do what's right. If we did, there wouldn't be any work for your father. Now, you wouldn't want your father to be out of work, would you? No. Well, then. Did you enjoy the magazines? I didn't get to read them. Pop gave them away before I had a chance. Mmm. That's too bad. Have you got any more? No, I haven't. I'm sorry. That's alright. Mom's sending to New York for some new ones. Harper's monthlys this time. Say... can I borrow this till they get here? Well, I don't think you'd enjoy that. What's it about? Oh, it's about medicine and doctoring and sewing people up and all that. I found a bird once with a broken leg, and I fixed it. Did you? How did you fix it? With two little pieces of wood and a piece of thread. Oh, splints, eh? Then I kept it in the attic for two weeks. When I took the little pieces of wood off, it could walk almost as good as ever. There you are. You're a doctor, and you don't know it. I like things like that. Well, then you'd like that book. I wouldn't mind being a doctor... Someday. Is it hard? Oh, very simple. All you have to do is to learn everything in that book and everything that's in a thousand other books, and then you're a doctor. Like you? Well... Like me, if you choose. But I think I'd aim slightly higher. There goes your mother, lad. Oh, uh, can I take this till my Harper's monthlyscome? It'll make you have bad dreams. Oh, I never dream. Don't you? Never dream, eh? Lucky boy. Mom! Where have you been? Talking with Dr. Shingle. He's an awfully nice man, mom. Look. He lent me this book. Your father will be angry. I know, but we don't have to tell him, and I can hide the book. That isn't honest, Jason. Well, we can't all do what's right. If we did, there'd be no work for pop. We wouldn't want him out of work, would we? Come on, boys! All together! All together! Whoa, boy. Whoa, ho! Whoa! Whoa, boy! Ethan: Whoa, boy! Whoa, ho! Whoa. Man: Thanks, Parson. That horse is the devil. He's just frightened, that's all. Frightened, eh? Well, you can buy him pretty cheap if you think so. Ethan, he's our horse. He's come to our very door. He's pretty wild, Mary. He's just excited, that's all. Ethan, don't you see? You need a horse. It's almost as though he were sent to us. I'll take some of that out of him! Hold on there! What will you take for that horse? $20, and I'll be glad to get rid of him. It's a deal. You mean it? He's yours. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, boy. Whoa. Whoa! There. Oh... Alright, take the harness off. Get rid of the collar there. Alright, gentlemen, the excitement is over. Well, Jim, looks like we're in the wrong business. Pull up the bar, son. What will you do if he acts up again, pop? I don't think he'll act up. He's just whip-shy, that's all. I'd never use a whip. Maybe he's balky. No, I don't think so. What are you going to call him? Bill or champ or something. Hmm. Only 4 years old. Look, dear, his eyes are so brown and kind. Let's call him "Pilgrim." Pilgrim? Why Pilgrim, Mary? Well, he's come to our very door. Don't you remember the old hymn-- "I'm a Pilgrim, I'm a stranger"? You've got a lot of poetry in you, Mary, and some of the things you say are mighty pretty. Yes, I guess Pilgrim would be a good name. Oh, Pilgrim. Our Pilgrim. Hello, son! Hello, pop! You're back quick! Oh, put him up, son. Mary: Ethan, dear, I didn't expect you until tomorrow. Oh, no water now, son. He's come a long way. Alright, I won't. Come on, Pilgrim. Hello, Jason. Hello, Annie. - Can I help you? - No. I can manage it. Ha ha ha! He's sure a pretty horse, alright. Wish we had him. He's a thoroughbred. He is? Sure. Pop wouldn't have anything else. Can I ride him sometime? Maybe. I don't know if he likes girls. Do you? What? Like girls? Oh, they're alright, I guess. Hey, Pilgrim. Come on. Say, you're alright. Do you think so, Jason? Ha ha! Never would have thought of that! What are you going to do when you grow up? Oh, I don't know. Be a doctor, maybe. I mean... - Are--are you going to be married? - Well, I should say not. I like preachers better than doctors. Takes brains to be a doctor-- a good one like Dr. Shingle. Mom thinks preachers are wonderful. I don't know what I'll be. Maybe I'll be an acrobat. They're nice, too. Woman: Annie! Annie! I might be a tightrope Walker. Jason! Your Harper's monthlys have come. Look. Back numbers, too. Why, Jason, aren't you glad? They're alright, but I like this better. Look, mom. Look at that. Good heavens, what is it? Wound in a man's leg-- A bad one, too. Terrible. Now turn over the page. There. That's what it looks like after it's been sewed up. You know, mom, it's wonderful the way they can fix up cuts and things like that. Why, that man would have died if they hadn't sewed him up, and now he's alive and healthy. Then you don't want the magazines, Jason? I want to look at them after a while. They seem kind of silly beside this book, mom. Get ready for supper, son. We thank thee, father, for this and all thy bounties. Teach us to avoid the pitfalls of prejudice, pride, and vanity. Make us thoughtful of the weak, the sick, the needy, and the unfortunate, and make our humble lives a reflection of thy goodness. We ask these things in thy name. Amen. Are you tired, dear? It's a long trip to Brownville. Did the israelites think of being tired or distance when they set out to find the promised land? But they had to go. Soldiers were chasing them. Ah, you've been reading your Bible again. No, sir. Just remembered that. - Hi, Jay. - Hi, Chauncey. -Howdy, Parson. -Hello, son. Got any more magazines, Jay? I heard you did. Pop said it. See you after a while, Chauncey. Oh, oh, alright. I'll be in front of the store. In case you did get some, I'll swap you for this. Sharp as a razor. Regular frogsticker. Bye. Bye. Ethan: More magazines, son? Yes, sir. I thought I made myself clear on that point. But, Ethan, these are Harper's monthlys. The name doesn't matter. In spite of what I've said, you've brought magazines into this house again without my permission. Ethan, I got them for him. It's my fault. Mary, please. Now, what have you to say for yourself? Nothing, sir. Don't you think you should apologize? No, sir. My wishes mean nothing to you? You don't have to read the magazines. There can be only one answer to that. You know what it is. Yes, sir. Why was I given such a rebellious son? Mary: Perhaps to give you more understanding of children, dear. Come with me. Jason, why do you defy your father? It's alright, mom. It won't hurt very much. Jason, you are impertinent, impudent. You didn't say anything about Harper's. You should have asked my permission, but that doesn't matter now. You were rude. Don't you see that you were? No, I don't. Yes, I think you do, and it distresses me. Jason, we want you to be a good boy-- polite, respectful to your mother and myself. We want your confidence. We want you to feel that we are your friends, not just your parents. I didn't do anything wrong, and you know it. Very well. Inside. Now, then... When you have conquered your rebellious spirit, you may come in and have your supper. Jason. Jason. Jason. Come inside, dear. I've kept your supper warm. I don't want any supper. Well, it's time for bed. Come. I didn't do anything wrong. He whipped me for nothing. No, son. You were rude-- disrespectful. You'd better tie Pilgrim. He seems nervous. Uh-huh. Mom, come here quick. Look. He's all cut and bleeding. Oh, how in the world did that happen? He must have snagged it on something. Oh, his poor shoulder. Mom, I can fix it. Oh, Jason. Mom, I can. Honest I can. All I need is a needle and thread. I know just how to do it. I can sew him up. Dr. Shingle's book tells all about it. Come on. Get me a needle and some hot water quick! Watch him. Don't let him bite me. Bite you? My dear, he's just trying to thank you. There, that will do it. He'll be alright in a couple of weeks. But there will be a scar. Yes, but he'll get well, and that's the main thing. ♪ From India's coral strand ♪ ♪ Where Afric's sunny fountains ♪ ♪ Roll down their golden sand ♪ ♪ From many an ancient river ♪ ♪ From many a palmy plain ♪ ♪ They call us to deliver ♪ ♪ Their land from error's chain ♪ Massey: ♪ Chain ♪ And now before we close the service, I want to say goodbye to you all for the next two weeks.

I'm taking my boy Jason with me so that he may see and understand the difficulties with which these people struggle. And now if miss Hawks will play the concluding hymn-- one moment, reverend Wilkins. What is it, doctor? I'd like to say a few words with your permission. I want to remind all of you that it was just 10 years ago today that the reverend Wilkins first set foot in pine hill. For 10 years, he served this community and served it well, but how has it served him? Pretty badly, I think. He still works for the same salary that we tricked him into accepting 10 years ago. Now, you keep out of this, doc. A bargain's a bargain. And a very fine bargain for us, too. He feeds our souls, and we starve his body. Now, hold on! Hold on! Cold weather's a-comin'. Comes every year, George Ames! Sister Cantwell, you pay your bills before you talk about raising folks' wages. Now, friends, please, please. This is no-- sorry, reverend, but the fat's in the fire. Doc shingle started it. Let's finish it... Right here in open meeting! Now see what you done, doc! Have a seat, Mr. Ames. We've always wanted to do the right thing, but George Ames has been agin it. What say? Shall we raise the Parson's salary? All: Yeah! Shame, shame-- Talking about money in front of the Parson. How do you suppose Mrs. Wilkins feels? She'll feel a lot worse if we don't! She's always done her share and a good deal more than her share. It's about time she's getting paid back for it. Parson Wilkins has done us all a lot of good. He ain't done me no good. Can't expect miracles. Be fair, George. Be fair. But we ain't got the money. You all know that. You can't get blood out of a turnip. Then quit being a turnip! Blood out of a turnip. That's very good, Mr. Ames. Doc, please go home. I'm going to bleed you tomorrow. Have you forgotten? That's right. You are. Now, let's not excite ourselves. A word to the wise. Well, folks, uh, I've been a-thinkin'. I think maybe doc shingle's right. We should raise the Parson's salary-- say, uh, $50 a year. Let's do a good job. Let's make it 100. Alright, uh, 100 it is, then. How's that, Parson? Huh? My friends, I thank you for your generosity. He who hears our lightest word, he who marks the sparrow's fall will glory in the nobleness of the spirit that prompts it. Now let us raise our voice in song. Miss Hawks. In the sweet by and by!

Oh, dear, no. He might get well. You must learn to take advantage of your opportunities, Jason, if you're going to be a doctor. Yes, sir. Goodnight, Annie. I'm very sorry, sir. Oh, that's alright.

I'll be thinking about you, too, Jason. Ooh! Ooh... - What, did you hurt yourself? - My knee. Oh. Well, is it bad? Well, it hurts. Well, here. Let me see. Why, Jason Wilkins! Oh, that's alright. I'm a doctor! I'm going to be a doctor, and this might be a fracture. Take care of yourself, Ethan. - Keep your chest bundled up. - Alright, dear. And don't ride after sundown. It gets so cold. All ready, pop? Bye, dear. Goodbye, Ethan. Bye, mom. Goodbye, son. Come on. Come on here! Pilgrim! Come on, Pilgrim! Come on, Pilgrim. Your saddlebag. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye. Somebody coming? Well, land of the living! It's the circuit rider. Well, sister Clark! Parson Wilkins! Well, for land's sakes, who'd have thought of seeing you way up here? Well, the Shepherd must go into the wilderness to find his sheep, sister Clark. Ain't it the truth? Why, I ain't seen you for nigh on to a year. Well, tie up your animals and--and come in and sit. Come on, Luke. Here, Luke. Oh, I'm mighty glad to see you, Parson. Well, how's your spiritual condition, sister Clark? Oh, bad, Parson. I'm getting so I'll talk to myself. Been cussing right smart, too. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I got a powerful misery in my back, and my teeth ain't no good, and... My rheumatiz catches me every once in a while. It--it gets quite bad at times. Yes, I--I have an awful time with it sometimes. Well, uh... Well... You rid all the way up here just to see me? Just to see you and to lead you one step nearer to the light, sister Clark, and tonight we hoped we might abide in your hospitality, and tomorrow we'll have a little meeting for you and your neighbors. This is my boy Jason. Oh! He a Parson, too? No. Perhaps he'll be a doctor. Land of the living! To think of a Parson and a doctor coming to my house at one time. I reckon that never happened before to nobody. Well... You folks hungry? I'll fetch you-- dang it. There ain't a hunk of pork in the house. Well, if you wouldn't mind waiting, maybe I could catch a chicken. Oh, no, no. Don't bother, sister Clark. Well, all I got in the house is some cornmeal and molasses. That's plenty--plenty, sister Clark. You sure, now? When the soul is at peace, the body is easily satisfied. Ain't it the truth? Come, I'll look. But, pop, couldn't we have waited for the chicken? Now, we'll have cornmeal and molasses, and no matter how it tastes, we'll eat it, you understand? If we don't, sister Clark will feel humiliated. Father, we thank thee for this and all thy bounties. Amen. Amen. Well, well, that's mighty fine mush, sister Clark. It's got short sweetening in it. Had much rain down your way, Parson? Yes, bountiful rain, sister Clark. A mite too bountiful, I think. Yes, bountiful rain, sister Clark. Ain't going to do the corn no good. There's a reason for everything, sister Clark. Ain't it the truth? Ha ha! Excuse me. That sure is good mush, if I do say it myself. Indeed it is, sister Clark. Indeed it is. Jason. Yes, sir? This is an important event in sister Clark's life-- our stopping here tonight. She never had a minister visit her before. Well, I don't wonder at that. That frog, pop-- Why, it made me sick. Suppose I'd called her attention to it-- told her it was there. She never would have recovered from the mortification-- the only time the minister stopped with her. It wasn't easy, but I swallowed it. That, sir, is my idea of courtesy, and I wish you not to forget it. I understand, father. Excuse me, Parson. Yes, sister Clark. Well, uh, I've been thinking. After the meeting tomorrow, where are you going to go? We're going up into the hills toward Tompkinsville. That's what I thought. Gets kind of cold up there nights this time of year. That boy of yourn ought to have a coat. Oh, he's alright. He's strong as a bull. Well, my man was as strong as a bull, too, but he got the misery and died in no time-- no time at all. Well, I want to give your boy this coat. That's very nice of you, sister Clark-- very nice, indeed. Jason, come here. Sister Clark wants you to have this coat. Thank you, sister Clark. Oh, that's alright. I ain't got much, but if you're going to be a doctor, you can have it. My man thought a lot of it. He never wore it no place, only to church. Ahh! Makes him look like a preacher, don't it? Ha ha! He could read the burial service over me right now. Well, that's a very handsome present, sister Clark. Very handsome, indeed. Ain't it? Well, if you're going to hold a meeting tomorrow, I better go and roust out the neighbors. Oh, now, don't bother. I'll attend to that in the morning. Oh, it ain't nothing to do, Parson. I'll just walk up on the hill and holler. Ha ha! Looking at him makes a body want to get married again. Ha ha! I don't want it! I won't wear it! Jason, I'd be ashamed. You like me to wear other people's castoff clothes! She gave you that coat out of the fullness of her heart. It belonged to the man she loved. She's cherished it for 20 years in remembrance of him. Well, then let her keep it! Suppose it were new. How would you feel then? It's not new! It's old and ragged and dirty! Ah, then it's not the fact that it's a gift. If it were new and pretty, you'd like it. Pride--pride and selfishness. They're out of place in our family, Jason. Unless you conquer them, they're going to make you unhappy and those who love you unhappy, too. All you seem to think about is that doctor book. Well, suppose I do? I'd rather save bodies than souls any day! I'm sorry you said that, son-- sorry to mistake that cold frankness of yours for courage. Come outside, please. Now, wait a minute, pop. You're not going to whip me anymore. I'm too old. You'll never be too old while I'm alive. You lay a hand on me, and I'll-- You'll what? I'll protect myself, pop! I'm warning you, I'll-- Сome outside. Jason, I feel inclined to give you another chance. I don't want another chance! You said you can whip me. I'm going to show you you can't! Oh, pop, I'm sorry. I--I didn't mean... Jason. Why aren't you with your father? What happened, Jason? Did anything happen to-- no. He's alright. Well, where is he? In the hills someplace, living in pigsties, eating slop for food. Jason, you mustn't talk like that about your father. Wash your face, dear. It's nearly time to eat. What's on my face you can't wash off. Jason... You've been fighting. - With whom? - Father. Oh, Jason. You fought with your father? Oh, Jason, I begged you to mind him. I couldn't help it, mom. Honest, I couldn't. I tried to do what he told me. I... mom, please don't cry. Mom, listen to me. I'm not going to stay here. I'm going away and make something of myself. I'm going someplace where they pay you in money and not in trash and empty promises. - Jason-- - I mean it, mom. I'm through with their hams and their wormy potatoes and their patched pants and old clothes that nobody wants anymore. Son, dear, you're just angry with your father. But it's not only that. What about the future? What will happen when pop gets too old to ride the circuit? They'll get another preacher, that's all, and then what'll we do? Stay here and rot?! I'm not going to do it, mom. I'm going to get out of here before I get to be like Ames and Meaker and all the rest of them. But, Jason, where can you go? How could you live? I'll get along. Other fellows have. I don't want you to go. Mom, why can't I go someplace and study to be a doctor? Jason, it takes too long, and we haven't any money. Money? We won't get any richer if I stay here. Pop's a failure, and you know it! Jason, don't you dare. There's a boat going up the river tomorrow, and I'm going to take it. No. I'm going to. I mean it. Don't tell me I can't, because I'm going. Mom, say it's alright. Mom, please say it's alright. I put some cookies in your bag, dear. Did you, mom? Son, dear... Feel this. It's all stiff. I sewed a few dollars in the lining... In case you need it. Aw, mom! Jason, don't feel unkindly toward your father. Everything he did-- everything he's ever done-- it was for me and for you. Oh, please, mom. Don't cry. Don't cry. Someday I'm coming home with my pockets loaded with money. Honest, I will, mom. You'll see. Man: All aboard! Don't forget to write! Dr. Crumm, a young man to see you. Who are you? What do you want? My name's Jason Wilkins, sir. If you please, sir, I'd like to study to be a doctor. - Oh, you would? - Yes, sir. Dr. Shingle told me to come and see you. Shingle? Shingle. - Big man with a vacant stare? - That's right, sir. -Thing in his eye? -Yes, sir. Always a little, uh... Always, sir. That's right. Hmm. What--you know him, sir? No, I do not. But you just described him, sir. Nobody knows him. No one can afford to know him. He's a disgrace. He drank himself out of the best practice in Baltimore. He founded this school, and then he carried on so, we had to take his name off of the building. Oh. He speaks very highly of you, sir. He says you're the greatest drawer of blood in the whole nation. I don't care anything about that. I... Oh, did he? Yes, sir. He says you cut off more arms and legs than all the other doctors in the whole world. Well, bless my soul. Where is he now? He's in our town now, in pine hill, Ohio. Ohio--way out west with the Indians. Are you an Indian? No, sir. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Hmm. Where'd you learn Latin and Greek? Latin and Greek? You mean to say, you have no languages? Then how in blazes are you going to be a doctor? I suppose you're poor, too. Yes, sir, but I'm willing to work. Work? Work at what? I could keep this office tidied up. The spittoons need cleaning, and I could-- the sandbox there-- We've got a janitor for that. Couldn't I help him, sir? Couldn't I be his assistant? I've come such a very long way, sir, and I do so want to be a doctor, and if you'll just let me stay, I'll work very hard, and I-- Please, please. Quid, come here. Yes, Dr. Crumm? How would you like an assistant, quid? Well, the work is rather difficult for one person. Alright. Take this boy along with you and feed him. From the looks of him, he's half-starved. And help him with his Latin and Greek. Quid. Yes, doctor? You don't think he's an Indian, do you? No feathers. - Have you been alright, dear? - Alright, dear. A letter from Jason, Ethan. Yes. It's about time. 5 letters in a year. Well, he's been very busy. Mmm. Well, Mary? I'm his father, you know. He's well... Working hard... And... May I see it, dear? "Dear mother, "I have been so busy and working so hard "that I haven't had time to write. "Is there any way we could raise just a little money very soon? "I was thinking you might sell your old mahogany hatbox. "Mrs. Canton always wanted it, I remember. "Just why, I could never understand. "Sell it to her, and after I get through school, "I'll buy you a dozen hatboxes. Your loving son, Jason." He means the hatbox I gave you when we were married. He doesn't understand about those things, dear. Definitely not. Ethan, don't you think I'd better send for Dr. Shingle? No, no. I'll be alright, dear. Mary? I was thinking, there's that old watch that belonged to father. It's gold, you know. Oh, no, Ethan. Well, the boy needs the money, and I think father would be pleased. Ethan, you're so good. I must get on with this. What is it? Vini, vidi, viti-- is that it? Veni, vidi, vici. Veni, vidi, vici. Huh? Splendid, splendid. The stew. Oh. Yeah, I'll bet. It's very good, considering the total absence of meat. It's very difficult, Jason, to make an appetizing stew without meat. We'll have meat as soon as I get a letter from home. Ah, you wrote the old fo-o-o-olks! A couple weeks ago. Should have an answer soon. Well, that's nice. Now, then... Supper is served. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Dines with... Where were you at 5:00? I had an amputation at 5:00, and you knew it. What do you mean by absenting yourself without my permission? I'm sorry, sir, but I had all the beds to make. Come, come, my lad. You can't study medicine and miss amputations. It can't be done. Yes, sir. How about the antrum of highmore? The antrum of highmore? Oh! Oh, yes. The antrum of highmore is a small pyramidal cavity within the body of the superior maxillary bone. Its walls correspond to the nasal, the orbital, the anterior, and the infratemporal surfaces of the bone. Its base is formed by the lateral walls of--of the, uh... The, uh... The nasal passage, and its apex extends into the zygomatic process. Well, bless my soul. Uh, the nasal wall presents, in the disarticulated bone, a small, irregular aperture which communicates with the nasal passage. In the articulated skull, the aperture is much reduced in size by the following bones: The unciform process of the ethmoid above, the ethmoidal process of the inferior nasal conch below, and the perpendicular part of the palate behind, and-- Ha ha ha! What's the matter? Weren't we doing alright? Too right, I'm afraid. Crumm: Here you are, Wilkins. A letter for you. Ha ha ha! Oh, here's a letter from home. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Well! Look. $20. Why so much, I wonder. Perhaps if you read the letter, you'll find out. Oh, yes. Good news? Oh, no. No. It's bad news. What's the trouble? My father's very sick. Oh, that's bad. He's not expected to live, and mom wants me to come home. Then, Jason, that's the thing to do. But, quid, how can I leave? The examination's coming next month. I'll lose a whole year. You won't miss the year, Jason, but you will miss your father... If he dies. But pop can't die. He's big and strong, and he--mom's just frightened, that's all. Isn't that reason enough to go? Your mother's frightened, or she wouldn't have asked you. I can see your home right now. I can see it this very evening. It isn't a happy home, not just because your father's sick, but because there's something missing. That something is you. They need you, Jason, both of them. You're right. Of course you're right, quid. Where's Mary? Try to rest. - Where's Mary? - I'm here. How long, doctor? You'll be up and around in a month. You're a good man, doctor. Who? Me? Nonsense. I'm a rascal. Oh, if only the world were full of rascals like you. I'll be back at midnight. I'm afraid we're going to lose him, Mrs. Wilkins. No. He's bled too long. If I don't untie him, I... Hello, Jason. Hello, Dr. Shingle. Jason! Mother, is--is he... He's still with us. I think he waited just for you. I had no idea. Lung fever. He's been sick for months. Ethan. Ethan. Our boy is here. He wants to speak to you. He wants to say something. Oh, my poor dear. He's gone, mom. Ask yourself, Jason-- was your father's life a failure? Oh, no, mom. I know different now. If I could've just told him, made him understand. He understands, dear. Good day, Mrs. Wilkins. Good day, Dr. Shingle-- or should I say merry Christmas? You're a week early, but I suppose it's alright. But a week, more or less, or a month or a year-- Have you heard from the boy? Don't you know? I thought I'd told everyone. He's coming home tomorrow. Is he? That's fine. My, my, my. Won't you two have a lot to say to each other after 3 years? He's a doctor now, you know. He graduated last week. A full-fledged doctor. Mmm, yes, a doctor, but the full-fledged part of it-- that doesn't come quite so quickly, Mrs. Wilkins. It'll be a long time before-- but he'll make good. Jason's a smart boy. Someday he'll be able to repay you for-- how have you been feeling lately? Well, I-- are you going in here? Yes. I have to get a few things. So am I. I'll just go in with you. Howdy, widow Wilkins. Good day, Mr. Inchpin. Oh, Mr. Ames, a few groceries I need. Oh, mittens. How much are these? 65 cents. They're nice. Quite a mess of stuff you're getting here, widdy. Yes. My boy's coming home for Christmas. Jason is-- Oh, yes? This will come to over a dollar. Have you got the money, widdy? I think I always have the money, Mr. Ames. Must be getting quite a bit of sewing to do lately. Pop, why don't you give Mrs. Wilkins her letter? Oh, yes. Letter? Chauncey, you go back and get it like a good boy, will you? My back's just killing me. Yeah? Your back's killing me, too. Now let me have the basket, and I'll get those things for you. Widdy Wilkins, the basket. Oh, yes. Oh, Mr. Ames, those groceries-- I won't want them now. I'm sorry. Make up your mind, widdy. My lumbago's about to kill me. Well, Jason isn't coming home. He'll be delayed. Consarn it, widdy. First you will, and then you won't, and me about to die with rheumatism. Oh, Mr. Ames. Go ahead, Jim. You got a jump. I don't want to. Look what will happen if I do. According to the rules, you got to jump. It ain't fair. I take one, and you take 3. Looks like you're in bad shape, Jim. - What say, Elder Massey? - Huh? Nothing. I was only thinking out loud. Ames, you owe me a little bill. Doc, how can you talk about money? Can't you see I'm a sick man? That's just it. I'm afraid you'll die without paying me. Doc, I wouldn't do a dirty trick like that. Wh-what do you mean? You don't look so good to me, Ames. Your heart's weak, and you've got lumbago. And I don't like the look of your liver either. No? I don't think you'll be with us very long, Mr. Ames. You... you don't? Let me feel your pulse. My, my. You're in bad shape, Ames. I am? What's the matter with me? You're a wreck-- mentally, physically, and morally. How'd you ever get into such a terrible condition? What'll I do, doc? What'll I do? I'm going to have to bleed you again. No, doc. Not again. Chauncey, quick. Get your father a chair. Somebody help him. Take it easy now, George. George, you look pale! Dr. Shingle: Mrs. Wilkins! Why do you walk so fast? Don't you know it's bad for you at your age? Let me feel your pulse. I bet your heart's beating like a triphammer. Now, don't you ever take that off again. Uh, you're liable to catch cold. Pilgrim... I'm sorry. You love him, too, don't you? Nice-looking horse, lady. How much do you want for him? I didn't know, but I-- $80 is our limit, lady. He's no Colt, you know. - If that's as high as you can go, I-- - It is, positively. Sam. $80. Goodbye, Pilgrim. Next! Come on. Man: This way, lady. Pilgrim. Here's your money, lady. Lady! 20, 40... 60, 80. $72.50 out of 80. I'll get your change. There you are. $7.50. And thank you. Fits you beautifully, sir. Aww. Uh, how much are those gloves? Gloves? Oh, those gauntlets. Would you like to see some? They're very distinct. All the officers are wearing them. How much are they? $7.00 a pair, sir. Want a pound of crackers, Mr. Meaker? That's plenty, Chauncey, my boy. Crackers is 8 cents a pound. More than they're worth. How do you expect me to stay in business if you eat up all of my profits? They're not profits. They're crackers. You wasn't so free when my pa was alive. Don't go running down your pa to me. He was generous to a fault. Damn shame for pine hill when he let that mule kick him in the head. I didn't say nothing against pa. You better not. I bet every time he thinks about you running this store, he turns over in his grave. Yep. He's probably spinning like a top! Chauncey... There's no letter for me today? No, no letter. Are you sure? Did you look good? Maybe next week. Next week. She's been saying that for two years. I'd larrup that boy if he was mine. I got a feeling there ain't no boy to larrup, Jim. What do you mean, Lou? More than likely her boy has been killed in the war. Hmm. Ain't that a shame? Aah! Aah! You-- I'm trapped! Aah! You better get some rest. I'm alright. You'll exhaust yourself, sir, if you don't-- nonsense. Dr. Wilkins, new lot just came in. Some are pretty bad. Where are they? Out in the yard, sir. Alright. I'll look at them. Dr. Wilkins. Yes, Dr. Crumm? You're wanted in Washington. Washington? The president wants to see you at once. The president? What on earth does he want to see me for? Maybe it's for a decoration, but at any rate, you'll have to go. Well, Dr. Crumm, how can I leave now? They're bringing the wounded in by the hundreds. Jason, this is an executive order. That's the president's signature. Quid? Yes, Dr. Crumm? You go along with him, and don't you two dawdle in Washington. We're short-handed now. Yes, sir. Come on, quid. - Lieutenant Jason Wilkins? - Yes, sir? Oh, uh, the president will see you now. This way, please. You are Jason Wilkins? Yes, Mr. President. I want to congratulate you, Wilkins. You've been doing great things in the field. Thank you, sir. Only my share. More than your share if what I hear is true. You've saved many lives. Sir, we're nearer to the lines than most field hospitals so that when a man is wounded, we're able to take care of him before complications set in. Hmm. I have received many letters praising your work. I have here a request from general Grant that you be transferred to his medical corps. I'd like that, sir. Well, we'll see. We'll see. You interest me in one particular, Wilkins. I understand you don't amputate except as a last resort. No need crippling men, Mr. President, unless it's absolutely necessary. Quite right. Quite right. What school did you go to? What medical college? The Baltimore college of surgery, sir. Must be a very good school. Sit down. Tell me about it. Thank you, sir. It's not much to look at from the outside, sir, but they have good doctors. They're very thorough and all that. - Did you have a scholarship there? - No, sir. I worked my way. But your board and room-- you had to pay that. Yes, sir. Must have had a hard time of it. Sir, I did odd jobs around the place, and... And I got money from home, sir. Home. Where is home, Wilkins? A little town in Ohio, sir. Pine hill. - Have you any relatives? - Only my mother. Only your mother. No brothers or sisters? No, sir. An only son, eh? And your mother-- is she well-off? Uh, no, sir. She's very poor, especially after my father died. But she managed to help you. Yes, sir. She... Raised the money by selling things. Things? What sort of things? Well, old things she didn't need, sir. What were they? I like to know about such things. Well, as I remember, sir, my grandfather's watch and an old silver teapot and... Some silver spoons, a hatbox, and an old sideboard. They were old things, sir, not good for anything. How is your mother, Wilkins? In good health? Yes, sir. Is she? I don't know, sir. You don't know? Why not? Well, to tell you the truth, sir, I--I've neglected to write. Well, surely she writes to you. Well, sir, I don't think she knows where I am. What's the matter with your mother, Wilkins? No good, like most mothers? She is good, sir. She must be a pretty poor sort. Else why have you dropped her like a hot stone? She must have done something terrible to you, Wilkins. What was it? I'll tell you what she did-- she carried you around in her arms more steps than you could ever count. She nursed you, covered you at night, played for you, cooked, sewed, scrubbed for you, tried to teach you right from wrong. That's what she did, Wilkins, and you repay her for that with what? Silence. Silence for two long years. But I've been fighting the war, sir. Hasn't she? Hear me, Wilkins. For two long years, your mother's heart has been torn with the thought that you were lying wounded and dying on some battlefield. Now she's given up. She thinks you're dead. A letter from you would have saved her that. You--you've talked to her, sir? She wrote to me... Asked me to find your grave. She wants to see it, put flowers on it, sit beside it, and dream of the little boy she used to hold in her arms. Oh, I'm so terribly sorry, sir. Sorry! She sold her household treasures, one by one, for you! Old things, you say, not good for anything. Oh, you ungrateful fool! Listen to me, boy. There's no finer quality in the world than gratitude, and there's nothing a man can have in his heart so mean, so low as ingratitude. Wilkins, sit in that chair. Now, write a letter to your mother. Tell her what an ungrateful wretch you've been and how sorry you are for it. Tell her you'll write often and keep that promise, Wilkins. From this time forward, you'll write her a letter every week. Do you understand me? Every week! If you fail, I'll have you court-martialed. Blow, blow, blow, winter white. Thou art not so unkind as man's ingratitude. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgotten. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, that does not bite so nigh as benefits forgotten. Oh, quid, after all she's done for me. Those years at school, this very uniform, everything. And what have I done? I'm an ungrateful fool. You were looking for success, Jason, and you found it, but in going ahead, you forgot to glance backward. Another skirmish? Yes, sir. A bad one, too, doctor. Many wounded? Yes, sir. Quite a lot. I guess I got here just in time. Yes, sir. What's the matter with him? It's them horses inside. Oh. Pilgrim! Pilgrim, you old saddle horn, how-- Whose--whose horse is this? Captain Griggs, sir. Well, where is he? He's inside there, sir. I want you to take care of this horse, and I want you to keep your eye on him and don't let anybody touch him. -Do you understand? -Yes, sir. Captain Griggs-- where is he? Captain Griggs? Captain, that white horse outside-- he belongs to you? Yes. May I have him, sir? Will you sell him to me? Sell him? Certainly not. Oh, please, sir, don't say no. I'll give you anything you ask. Money can't buy him, son. The finest horse I ever owned. Now, captain, listen to me, please. That horse belonged to my mother, and she sold him-- she sold everything she had in this world for me. For me. Can't I make you understand, sir? I've been ungrateful for everything. Please, sir, let me take him back to her. Dr. Wilkins, this man is badly wounded. I'm sorry, doctor, but just let me have one more word. Wait a minute. Are you Dr. Wilkins? Yes, sir. I've heard of you. These other doctors are going to take my arm off. You can save it. - Oh, I don't know, sir. - Oh, you can do it. I know you can. Here. I'll make a bargain with you. Save my arm... And you can have the horse. Oh, try, doctor. I want that arm. It's up to you, doctor. I'll save your arm. Alright. Get him into the operating room. Hurry. Quid! Quid, Griggs is going to be alright. Hey there, boy. Jason, I thought you ought to have this. What's this? Leave of absence, commonly called a furlough. You think of everything, don't you, quid? Between us, we hit a pretty good average. Come on, Pilgrim. We're going home. Hey, come on! Come on over! Come on, Pilgrim. We're almost home. Come on, boy. Come on! Come on, boy! Come on, Pilgrim! Mom. Mom. Oh, Jason! My boy. Oh, mom. Ohh! Oh, mom, forgive me. Please forgive me. Oh, Ethan, he's come home. Oh, my. I guess it's too much happiness for me. I thought I heard Pilgrim. You did, mom. Pilgrim! Darling Pilgrim. You haven't forgotten, have you, dear? We thank thee, father, for this and all thy bounty. Teach us to avoid the pitfalls of prejudice, pride, and vanity. Give us strength to aid the helpless. Rid our hearts of selfishness. Teach us mercy, humility, and charity. Make us thoughtful of the weak, the sick, the unfortunate and needy. Make our humble lives a reflection of thy goodness. These things we ask in thy name. Amen. We must hurry if we're going to meet him. You'll like the new minister, dear. He's very good. He reminds me of--
