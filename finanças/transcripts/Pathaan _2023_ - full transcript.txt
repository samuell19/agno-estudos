What are you looking at? It's cancer Not some pretty girl's Instagram page How long have I got? Three years. Maybe The Indian government has made the shocking decision today to revoke Kashmir's special status The Indian Parliament has unilaterally announced Articl 370 is abrogated Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Office has condemned this unilateral action and said that Pakistan will weigh up all options and give a befitting response Article 370 canceled How can India do that? This is wrong, sir This is not wrong It's a declaration of war You said three years, right? It’s long enough Time for diplomacy has passed, sir. If we wait for the UN resolution. then India will take control of our Azad Kashmir next. A man of God cannot cha enge them A man God cannot challenge them It's time to befwend the Devil General Qadir for you General Qadir, all in order? Don't want order, I want chaos What do you want? You sure? Once that bullet is fired, It won't go back into the gun You need to be sure. Can you do it? It'll take time, but it can be done A radar can’t detect it, no signal can stop it It fears nothing, nor can it be reasoned with. Once it's launched, it's like a djinn from Hell Countdown to Judgement Day starts Good. Jim will let you know where to deliver it Why? Doesn't he trust you? Jim?

Excuse me, sir, you can't be serious - These people are my officers . -They're not officers. You've made JOCR with some broken jokers They're just broken eggshells How dare you! Good invention, guys - Rishi, well done! -Thankyou, sir - Did you think I actually. - No, ma'am. Oh, come on, Pathaan I was just playing along Would I talk to a superior like that? No. never Don't be a child. I admit Rishi's invention is very real But Pathaan. you can't mess with me - Is this a bad time? - No, sir.

No, sir It wasn't Aleph Or Boko Haram or Daesh At least, they weren't directly involved. They outsourced these attacks to a private terrorist group They wo k ®n contract, not for ideological reasons Really? errorists are corporations now? Let's say a group like this exists, so what? They’re Interpol's problem, not India’s. Actually sir, now it is. ually sir, now it is Because their next episode s an India special And this is a big one. Sir, through the darknet we found out that Outfit X is planning something big in Dubai. At the Asian Scientific Confere two Indian scientists will repre nt India and our...

They won't get near the President -Thankyou, sir. -Thank you. Another request, sir these... eggsh e with e Trust me, Luthra. You look after the President's security. I changed the President's travel itinerary at the last minute No sign of explosives There are no spots for a siper to hide Absolutely nothing suspicious Intel was real, sir But now there's radio silence They've become more careful or. Sir, you said you changed the President's travel route What was it before? He was to travel with the two scientists and the press Showing support for science. Now he's taking another route With full security What about our scientists'? Will they travel with the President"? No. Multiple vehicles make security tricky I want our NSG commandos to focus on the President So the two scientists who had NSG cover, no longer have it Damn it’ They tricked us into changing the travel itinerary. eir target is not the President, sir. I was hoping to take a selfie with the President with the President and impress the missus’ You still want to impress her, after thirty years'? Science s ea y Farooqui. Love is hard Sir, we've been attacked. You were right, Pathaan. They've attack d the scientists' convoy Lock me to the scientists' phone - On it sir - Now' Wait. Don't shoot! Wait Don’t shoot!

Pathaan Sir, I've sent you the Hummer’s location There's the Hummer sir Pathaan, I've been waiting for a long time to meet you I heard a lot about you when I was in RAW. They call me "Jim" Jim? You probably heard I was dead. So? Well, I am actually dead for India Here's the proof. Bravery award. I died a bloody hero How come, Jim? -I heard you... - ...were the best? You heard right I still am She broke my heart She'll break yours too. The difference is I considered myself her lover, and you think you're her s Mother India! You're lucky. You'll die believing your patriotism meant something. I'm sure they'll t for bravery on medal for bravery you grave They'll call you a martyr. But cost to the country? Zero. If life was different, perhaps we'd be friends. What a pity! We have to play the cards we're dealt. And in this round, I hold all the aces. Raza! Rishi! Rishi - My seat belt. -I was stuck. Pathaan, my seat belt. Rishi' - My legs are stuck. - Come on My leg is stuck, sir. Rishi. - My leg is stuck. - Rishi. Pathaan! Sir, my leg is stuck.

These choppers won't fly through the tunnel. they'll crash int he building. key'll r to the buildin Well, Pathaan? What next? Their lives hang by this rope. Only you can untie the knot So, what's it gonn be. budd mpnon sense? Say hello to Mother India Tell her I'm coming soon I've a score to settle. Jim. Can't trust dead men to stay dead. Was m working for RAW? Jim and Kabir. Our best agents. They were quite similar Calculative, precise, methodical He first listens to his heart, then to his superiors. - So, what went wrong? -A job. So, what went wrong? Remember the ONCC drilling team the Somalian priates kidnapped? Jim went solo He managed to save six hostages, totally unharmed. The pirates swore to take revenge. They finally tracked Jim down. They asked for a ransom of 100 million in exchange for Jim and his wife But we don't negotiate with terrorists You love your country too much. But your country, no love you. No! No! No! No! No. Please leave her No! No! No! We never found Jim's body. So we assumed he was dead. Jim was given a medal, the bravery award One of his uncles received it. Couldn't you have paid the ransom for an agent like him and his family? Your department does not lack funds, Our funds can't be wasted ersonal matters Such honesty, sir! What if it was a minister's family'? Only the weak go down on their knees, Pathaan. Not soldiers. Your decision has convinced him that his actions are justified. And now Shweta, check for leads on the darknet. - Raktbee - What's that? - Raktbeej. Sounds like a codeword. - For a man? Or an object? Have the dead in Dubai been identified? Yes sir. All ex-soldiers or secret agents. They recently received money transfers. From one account? Yes. From a Pakistani doctor Rubina Mohsin She lives in London. Her account was inactive for months. Then these transfers were made Who knows if she was even awar The bank would've alerted her about the transfers. We've hacked her emails. She hasn't logged in for a month. Her phone is off too She's taking a flight Where to? t was sh be o 5hje‘ be off If it was another agent, she'd be lea or Syria. As it’s you - it's Spain. I'm desperate for a vacation.

You thought you were the only ones monitoring Outfit X. I've been with them for a year, undercover. Why all this? With you. we'll get what I want faster When did we beco e a we"? When did we become a 'we”? When I saved your life. You endangered it You know that, right? - Run. - Where are you? Run - where are you? W e are going? -Wait' - Duck You aim well. So do they. Father! Morning. You were out for 18 hours. Take it easy. Fever's down. No Infection. And luckily the bullet dn't touch any vital organ. You were calling for your father and crying You kept asking them to let your father go Father He was a journalist in the Middle East He asked too many questions Printed too many answers So he was brutally tortured and we were made to watch from the front row Then you went to Pakistan with your mother and joined medical college Dr. Rubina Mohsin. Affer that, to serve humanity. you joined the ISI. Oh. Of course Cheers Couldn't you find a cheaper is we have big budgets But seriously, why did you save my life? Aren't your good looks and personality enough? Normally they are. I'm so sexy. You said we’d get what you wanted faster with me. So I want to know, what do "we" want? Raktbeej. Heard the name? He was a demon. Wherever a drop of his blood fell, another Raktbeej was born Basically, it was impossible to destroy Raktbeej. Whatever this Raktbeej is. it's in Russia In 7 days ..what? Jim will take deliver bf Raktbeej in 7 day Then all hell break loose basicatl ehave... Bottoms up! Think you skipped school the day they spoke about ISI and India. You see we don't get on so well. Besides, the first day we met, you put Jim's gun against my head. Remember? So don't take it personally ave few trust issues. Some things are more important than trust issues Like these 7 day So ar ou in? Or are you out? Russia's a big place Do you know the address'? Any landmark? You know Something Vault 412, Moscow Woskwich Tower You moust know the address You were Posted in Russia for three years What else do you know about me? Do you want me to tell you everything now? Scary An ISI agent tells us there's something in Moscow that Jim’s after. Yes, ma'am. I've heard about R'aktbeej on the darknet. Do you know what it is? So, let's hope Whever it is. it stays unknown. I know you're fcfrniliar with every corner of Russia But Russia is still a friendly country and a crucial ally. A scandal will not be tolerated in Moscow or in Delhi. Ma'am you know Jim Wants Raktbeej. If he can't buy it. he'll steal it. And if you get caught? Don't try negotiating for me. I'm not Jim. Damn it! Whatever Raktbeej is, neither Jim nor ISI should get their hands on it. Go, get it! Welcome. Sir. me show you around Same to you. -	For an English dictionary -	Thank you, sir. Thank you. You need anything, contact Andrei. You have a great honeymoon You didn't tell me we were on our honeymoon. If you had denied it, it would've broken Andrei’s heart. Look. What a stunning-view! Wow! I never thought I'd see such a big building on my wedding night! If you stay with me, there's more fun to come. Many corporates have their offices in that building. W08KWI0H TOWER The 92nd loor osts The 92nd floor is hdme to the orld's most secure vault No y or explosive can open it No laser can cut through. No acid'burn through Can't cut it, can't break it. Can’t blow it up, can't burn it. But. but. but. there's only one problem The vault has a lock and key but two different people have them So when you need to open it. an uncle brings the lock from his home and an aunty brings the key The lock and key meet like the union of the Ganges and Jamuna So. must we steal both lock and key? Yes, exactly But there's a complication The lock is 12 kms away in Uncle Grigr's Office And the key is 16kms away with Aunty Karen And of course, their offices are in opposite direction And the best part?' We must get to the vault in 10 minutes once we've stolen them I love this sugar-free yoghurt. As soon as the lock and key are removed. a timer starts ticking. Within 10 minutes, at FSB h someone must enter an "all- a s, c e . This confirms all's well and it's not Rubai and Pathaan -	Or else... -	Or else? I lockdown T Lock, key or prayer . nothing makes a nee. Unless the system is re et in three places Game over How can we reach the vau in 10 minutes in Moscow tna Step 1 To get to the main lock, we must first open another lock To open tna.t we need Uncle Grigor's fingerprints -Any cops in sight? -Why? Because you’re looking like a bomb! Have a blast. -Oh, I will. jlLIOOQ Step 2 Our key-holding Aunty Karen - You'll seduce her? - / wish I'm not her type She'll be knocked out by some sleeping pills You are my Karen! Good night, K-K-K-Karen. Step 3 we need tow planes. And tow pilots Absolute professionals You picked this place? Pilots? Right. They're lats. Very professional. Actually, flying is just their hobby Professi , They're singers. -	Singers? -	Singers. What about the bill? Rubai, listen. You'll have some cheese? Never mind It's fun. Are you and the missus looking for anything in particular? Very particular How would you like to earn 20,000 boobies'? Rubles' What did I say? I meant rdbles. We have a meeting with Raktbeej. Our final step. Tomorrow we have an appointment with Raktbeej, so.. Get some rest This may be our last night outside a Russian jail. Then we shouldn't waste it Yeah! Waste is not good. Maybe I.. Could you help with my bandages? Bandages? Of course Nothing better I'd like to do than change your bandages. Pathaan. I mean, you're actually a Pathaan? Are you a Muslim’’ Rubai, I don't know what I am. Who I am. Or who my parents were Or why I was abandoned in front of a cinema. Landed up in an orphanage, then a juvenile centre, then a remand home So, it was really my country that raised me I wanted to be a good son and serve my parents Pay them back So I joined the Indian army - I'm sorry. - It’s OK By the way. what film was playing at the cinema where tiey left you? You don't take emotions seriously'? Do you? Never So how did you turn from Lawaaris to Khuda Gawah? It was in 2002 I was in Afghanistan on a joint mission with the US army My first mission The US target that day was a Salauddin Hussemi a Taliban leader A missile was locked on to the location of his phone This Mr. Husseini was a teacher in a madrasa People started to run The problem was there were 30 kids still in the madrasa and the missile was to strike in one minute The missile was heading for the madrasa The kids were still inside I was in a coma for a month A day did not go by without someone in that village praying for me Subhanallah -	Adaab. -	Salaam. Everyone has been praying for your good health I swear, no Pathaan mother has ever given birth to someone as brave as you. From today, we are yours and you are ours. Our Pathaan You know what?

We're 90 seconds late In a minute the alarm will go off. Let's go! We're 90 seconds late In a minute the alarm will go off Let’s go! - Vault number? -412 How do these steps open? No time for that Here Throw it to me Pathaan, I'm sorry. It's impossible to open that vault It is possible. For Pathaan Pathaan? Why would he help you? - Mat --check You mean "checkmate ? When the king tl inks the queen will sacrifice herself for him all his concentration is on saving the queen When the king realises the queen has switched sides, it'll be Checkmate The king is dead The king is dead. Pathaan was put into a high security prison That's where I last saw him He's not with us. Oh please. Miss Grewal, we know he's Marcos’s agent He was. He went rogue. Do.you think we would sanction this stupidity? Whatever he's done, we have no stake in it. So you don't care how we deal with this situation? Be my guest And if this "situation" survives, pump him with two bullets from me. I'll reimburse you going t crush your bones t owder You're a dead man walking. What was he saying? I'm going to kill you. Guys. Timeout, guys! Please. Stopped at a coffee sh p? And a pharmac And a pharmacy Here. Painkillers Men don't feel pain Take them, brother They're coming You've taken it easy too long Let's get to work. Tiger, he's got a grenade - So what! -I have the pin. When will you stop pulling pins? I'm sorry I’m having a blast. Are you9 Oh man! Behind you! Mission accomplished! Did they come for you? For you You made big trouble, didn't you? I'm a Pathaan - Shall we run? - Me first You got scared, right? I know. For you. Look back! Run Pathaan. run. Listen I'm going on a big mission. Tiger may need Pathaan. So stay alive. I will. I’ll be there. Oh, man I promise. - Don't need promises. - Then what? I need those painkillers. Oh, painkillers. It's here. This is yours, this is mine. Bitter isn't it It's a painkiller. Not chewing gum So, Tiger helped Pathaan in Russia? How come Pathaan was missing for so long? That was the first time anyone had defeated Pathaan He swore without Rubai, Jim and Raktbeej To maintain diplomatic relations with ussia Pathaan's absence suited us. And now? The time of Pathaan's exile is over. "Pump him with two bullets from me." What could I have said? Pathaan's like a son to me. don't torture him too much." Why did Luthra let you go to Russia? Don't ask. He wanted to go himself He would've shot you point-blank if he knew the reason I went there wa to give you a message. He's not with us Did Raafe tell you anything? Jim bought two Saber missiles He doesn't know why. ot where Jim is where she is. Paris? When? A e urs ago Activity? Walks, cafes. Walks. s she's waiting someone. Perhaps st es waiting for so n I have to go. nt keep a girl waiting. Pathaan, I do you stole from the Russians, but I've never seen them so tense Find it Find Jim Ma'am Salaam Alaikum Wa' alaikumu s- salaam. May Peace be upon on you too Thank you. Raza In romantic Paris - two's company, three's a crowd I must talk to her about the pleasures of love. Alone Thank you. I fgured when I'd see you again, d shoot you first, then ask questions. But you called me here your own accord, so Of course, Rubai. we conveniently got your photo at the Paris metro. You knew I'd see that CCTV footage. And I would come to you. So well, I'm here. Tell me quickly what you have to say. Raktbeej You want to know what it is? What is it? • ••I •••• ••••ft* • ••• Smallpox? It was eradicated in 1980. Yes, but some research facilities still have samples of the virus, in case we need to fight smallpox again. The virus samples were in Russia. We stole them. But why? Every country in this world has a vaccine against smallpox In case of an emergency outbreak. The vaccine works against the old smallpox virus. Jim has mutated it. The mutated virus is far more dangerous. We have no vaccine against it. r No cure either. That’s why he planned the big operation in Dubai to kidnap Dr. Sahani. Who for? Who's paying him? Do you know General Qadir? It:s*time to befnienti the Devil - Your government? The General joined forces with ISI extremists when India abrogated Article 370. Pathaan I swear, I had no idea at all that my own people would do such a mad thing. If this virus spreads, how can Pakistan save itself? He has changed the virus's DNA. It does not follow the one-week pattern like Covid-19. This kills within a few hours. Anyone infected by this virus cannot go very far. It decimates a whole city in a matter of days, once it spreads. But it can also be contained within a city's borders It attacks one city at a time. Not the whole world. But how, Rubai? So why do you think I can trust you again? I'm a soldier, Pathaan. Like you, I will do anything for my country. But this? Killing thousands of innocents? This is not my idea of war. Trust me, Pathaan. Just once more. I'll always have my eye on you. One wrong move... I've made all the wrong moves I had to. Now I want them erased. Where's Jim? He's meeting Dr. Sahani in his lab in two days. Tell me about this lab. Everything. Rubai' ooking good. Aiwa s. But you haven't noticed me before. Who says love is only at first sight? Want to drown in them? I know the difference between the sea and lava. Did you design the virus as instructed? Are you really going to do this? you really going to do this? For money? You think this is about money? I could’ve easily robbed a bank blindfolded Doctor I was asked a question once "What's your price? "The price of your family? "Your child?" Today you h my answer. It's I who will decide the price of you life Do you have ower to buy me? So buy me This is crazy These are your own people Your own country Oh, Doc! Country, borders, etceter They exist to remind the weak to stay in their place While the real machines keep turning: power and control. I don't care for any coun My country is wherever I ha to be. That’s my world. Let me check. If anything |?ia pens to these orbs, then c t our own throat. Dr. Saham Dr Sahani. Give me the orbs The orbs are safe. Let's go Jim, I was trying to Raktbeej safe... Normally when you lie, it's so smoothly done I’m touched you're scared of me. - Jim, trust me, I... - Explain to your people how you betrayed them. General Qadir is not "my people". When my people hear what he's done, they'll bloody hang hi I have a daughter. I wanted you to stay alive for her sake. Bag? He must be close Give it to me, Pathaan. Giv o me, Pathaan. No, sir. We have to destroy it. Absolutely not. Jim has mutated the smallpox virus. so v/e' need to make a vaccine. -1 don't think so, sir - Give it to me. Pathaan! What the hell, sir? What's going on? She's ISI, PatRaan We have the virus orb, thanks to her. And thanks to her, the virus landed in Jim's hands. She knows Jim's plans. - We have to question her, Pathaan. - Ma'am... Besides, where can she go now? Jim and the ISI are looking for her. If we let her go, she won't survive for two days. - Take her. - Wait Pathaan... You'll be OK. Pathaan's promise. Ma'am, you'll have to wear this suit Yes, Doctor? I got your message Come. Nandini must w y mething There are three	layers to get to the orb's core - Did you cut through-? - We got to the central core - Di cut through? - We got to the central core. - Where the virus is. - It was empty. We analysed the liquid carefully It's water. Only water What happened to the lights? Ma'am, our system has been hacked. There's an incoming video call It's Jim. Connect him Hello, hello How's everyone? Was it fun? Finding only pure distilled mineral water in the orb? Just following my plan in case anyone tried to force the orbs open The orb has three layers The first layer was empty Only a vacuum. The seuL.d 'a er a It contained an invisible corrosive gas It's an acid that melts plastic on contact. Your plastic suits for example The third layer contained my superstar Raktbeej The virus is now all over the lab In the orb's center. you'll find clean safe mineral water You won't feel thirsty when you're dying You think I'm bluffing? Look at your pretty white suits Are they turning black? Your suits are of no use now The virus you were looking for in the water is invading your whole body. If pain is measured on a scale of 10. you'll experience it at 13 or 14. Exciting right? A demo ofRaktbeej So please, share your dying moments on Instagram and Twitter Things that ares n - they sell. Cheers Lock down the lab. Lock the lab! Lock the lab! All the others, get out’ All the others, get u . others, get out We're sealing the lab. Get out! Get out all of you We can decontaminate the atmosphere. UV radiation, gamma rays. But how can you decontaminate us. Luthra? But how can you decontaminate us.

Oh ho' That never occurred to me What can I do? Everything is ready My Saber missile. Armed and TSady It's in a location that only I know It's in a Io at An Indian city that only I know Such a pity! You blew up your lab before you could see what Raktbeej was capable of But when it spreads in Delhi Mumbai. Hyderabad or Amritsar what will you do? Blow up those cities? What do you want? I want you to negotiate with a terrorist. Colonel Luthra. You didn't do it for me Now you'll negotiate with me What do you want? What do you thlhk? Kashmir Obviously. Kashmir You have 24 hours After 24 hours. if a single soldier a single tank, a single gun or the Indian flag is seen in Kashmir, then That's impossible. How can I make that happen in 24 hours? We need time to think. Perhaps I used the wrong word that's why you're confus This is not a negotiation Colonel Luthra. it's an ultimatum Your time starts The situation you're in, the fear that's overcoming, you I've been there No one took responsibility for the death of my wife and unborn child. A now no one is responsible for your death How does it feel, guys? It's not appropriate to say "Jai Hind" So. take care Time is running out. Pathaan, you have to stop this madman. Look! Your innocent family. You know what we'll do to them? Whichever city the missile strikes, that's where your family will be. Where is that missile? was only to make payment I said Jim would tell them where to deliver it. If you don't know the city, you must know the country. Where? Afghanistan. Father!

I don't want calm, I want havoc. India will not give Kashmir, General. do we teach them a lesson? The missile is ready. You just have to press the button and I have to get paid. Then boom! General. Everyone in my village was struck by a strange disease They're all dead now A metal ball fell here and no one survived after that What are they saying? The video is from an Afghan village, some 200 kms away. The local TV is saying a strange virus is spreading through the village It has the same symptoms as smallpox. That's... that's impossible Raktbeej. How can it be Raktbeej? One orb is on the missile, e other was destroyed in India. Either you're a fool, or you think I am. If you want all your money, find out how this other Raktbeej landed there. You're mistaken If you think I’m your friend, or that I have sympathy towards Pakistan. Or that I need money. You haven't understood me, General. I am the demon Raktbeej. Leave me! If you want to see a free show, why pick on Delhi? Change the co-ordinates. Let's party in Islamabad. No, sorry. I'm sorry. Don't do that You handle it yourself, right? Exactly as you told me. I don't know where it came from. Find out what's going on. Who's behind this? I want the answer, and his head. want both. Welcome' To my home! This is my Afghan family. My people. Our Pathaan. What did you find there? The man who stands before you. Pathaan. You have this nasty habit. You smell a party and arrive invited. Never ever invited to a bash, Pathaan just loves to gatecrash If you have a party - in Pathaan's home With some fireworks Some joke, General! Another of your agents has fallen in love with the enemy. First there was Zoya and Tiger. And now... Has ISI turned into some dating website for Indian agents? Pathaan! - Raza. - Pathaan. - Raza. - Pathaan.

Pathaan and Colonel Luthra listen to me Raktbeej is on a plane Flight LT-72. It's circling Delhi right now. If the orb can be deactivated, me to air traffic control Now! Pathaan find Jim Flight LT-72, do you hear me? Ground Air Control, this is Captain Mehra from Flight LT-72. Landing permission denied. I repeat, landin permission denied. What? Raktbeej is sitting happily in a plane over Delhi now. The orb has six minutes left And so does Delhi In six ni will spread through the plane's AC ducts you can grab this detonator switch What a pity! It's unlikely Captain Mehra, this is Colonel Luthra from RAW There's a biological weapon on board The devie is in your AC ducts What? What am I supposed to do, Colonel? We're running low on fuel. Captain, you're carrying a very dangerous weapon. Fly as far as you can from Delhi, please. I found it, Colonel. Only four minutes to go. Get me the minister. Yes, sir. There is no other option. Jai Hind. - Connect me to missile command - Yes, sir Captain, we will have to destroy the plane. There must be another way, Colonel. I have 300 passengers and many children on board. Right now, your plane is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. I’m sorry. We...can't save you Missile control, intiate strike protocol Come on, Pathaan There's only one option. Remember how you sacrificed your scientists? Play "Vande Mataram" on the plane and blow up the passengers. Fire. My family's lives were sacrificed, Now it's your turn to make a sacrifice. Farewell, Pathaan. The timer has stopped, sir Please stop the missile Abort, abort, abort! Ladies and gentlemen this is your Captain here Please buckle up because we're about to land in Delhi You couldn't understand something very simple. A soldier does not ask what his country can do for him. He asks what he can do for his cou You don't deserve this Jim Give your Mother India my last goodbye. Jai Hind If anyone merits this medal, it's you I've never met a braver soldier than you Ma' am Pathaan. Colonel, good news. I'm leaving. So you won't suffer from acidity and blood pressure anymore Our paths are separate now. -Thankyou, sir - The war is not over, Pathaan. -We need you. - Me But we are... what did you call us? Broken eggshells'? I admit mistakes were made, Pathaan. But this country cannot be saved by Colonel Luthra alone. Or by Tiger or Kabir. Or even by Pathaan. Everyone is needed There are many soldiers like them, Pathaan. Some with wounded bodies, others with damaged souls. But they are ready to sacrifice their lives for this country. These broken folk can only be put together with the gold that has lived through fire. And that person is you. Make the sharpest sword, Pathaan, so the souls' of the enemy tremble. But who will wield that sword? Who will it strike? How will it strike? Who will it strike? - How will it strike? Who decides that? The sword is yours. Thank you. Thank you very much. sir. - Let's start. - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I have an urgent appointment. With whom? With my hairdresser. You cutting your hair? No, sir. Only a shampoo. If you want to all m love I ask only my heart for permission The ways of love only the fortunate know Risking my own life I saved the enemy Many people love to talk -I know what's real, my friends - My friends Many people love to talk but I know what's real I can even stop the wind The Lord showers you with orayers When pathaan get into the groove my love He steals all hearts The promises he make my love He'll stand by forever When Pathaan get into the groove my love He steals all hearts The promises he make my love Jn ro s he my I ve He'll stand by forever I'll tell you how to win hearts my friends I will tell you how I'll tell you how to love the enemy I will tell you how I will tell you how Just give me a sign I'll give my heart to you twice over Feeling of friendship have cast their spell Even enemies turn to me for an embrace When Pathaan gets into the groove my love He steals all heart The promises he makes my love He'll stand by forever When Pathaan gets into the groove. He steals all hearts The promises he makes, my love He'll stand by forever Can't do it anymore. Yeah. I've been thinking, it's been 30 years, we should stop. But who’ll replace us? There's that guy. That guy. What about that other guy? He has something. No, not him. He's got no style. Nah! Never mind. And him? Our country is at stake. We can't leave it to kids. Let's go. Lower back.
