Well, l hope so. - Don`t you worry Debu. Your time will also come. l like that. Cheers man. Not bad. - That is fine. Coach l suppose everything is done.. No, not yet. We need a doctor. To play professional football.. ..we need a physiotherapist. Coach, we could ask Rumana. She is a doctor. Have you lost it? You are talking rubbish. She has just graduated. She wants to join a hospital. Besides, football is a man`s game.. and Rumana is a girl. You know the places where we get hurt. He`s spoken like a true-blue Pathan! ldiot! Come on, let`s play. You are hired. No questions, no money Welcome to the preseason analysis of the combined county league for 2007. My name is Shweta Singh. And l am Johnny Bakshi. Everyday, an hour per club.. and the profiles of each player and the odds.. - Pammi,.. you are a huge Southall fan, aren`t you? Absolutely, Aakash. Why don`t you become our official hair stylist? l`m not as lucky. l have a brilliant idea. Listen. Come on, take the ball. 1 , 2 this way. Debu, release the ball.. lt is a team game, man! Oh, come on Debu. Do you think we can win? They are not bad players. But winning is a habit that takes time to build. Good Shaan. We can defend but our attack..l`m not so sure. That is why we have lost so many times. Shaan is a good midfielder. He`s brilliant. But what can he do on his own? We need a good striker. One good striker.. And l can do wonders with these guys. Come on, open spaces. Come on. Coach, look at what l have brought. Why are you late? Come on. Come on guys. What`s up, man. We have a sponsor. Pammi`s Hair salon for men. Pammi`s? Pammi`s Hair Salon. ldiot, have you lost it? - Are we to wear this? Why not? What`s wrong with it? Ranveer, what`s your problem? These t-shirts are for free. We are here to play football, not to model. What`s so funny, you jerk? You are fortunate. lf your father were to sponsor us.. we`d have lamb on the front.. and chicken on the back! Guys, show is over. Back to the game. Show is over now. - Come on, let`s go. l want to show you something. Will you come with me? Please. Okay. That`s what you have been doing. - He is going speed. That`s what the team needs. Come on, Sunny. Who is he? - Sunny. lndian boy. Your boyfriend. No. Good work, guys. Alright. - We will all catch up at 5:30 guys. - Hi. Hi. - He is Tony. Sunny. Do you know that.. Tony was the best we ever had.. ..and now he is our coach. Congratulations! l have seen your game. But you are wasting your time here. You should play with your own people. Why don`t you join Southall United? Are you serious? l play football. l`m not interested.. in being part of a circus. Southall is not a circus, Sunny boy. l am sure we will meet again soon. Sweet dreams. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Here, please. Come on. - Oh shit! Useless dogs.. they lost. Even these English dogs don`t want us to do well. English dogs. They will all salute us one day. Like this! Ladies and gentlemen. Not like that, like this. They will salute us like this. They will salute us like this. With God`s grace it will happen. Call out to the Mughal army that.. they are to raze England to the ground! And Your majesty with God`s grace this year`s.. Eid is to be celebrated in.. Buckingham Palace. Your majesty.. Who did this? l didn`t see.. You didn`t see? By the time l came out, there was no one. That jerk must have done it.. Who is he? - He`s a bastard! What`s up Pathan? ls your team practicing in the restaurant these days? You scoundrel! Hold it, there. Shaan, no fighting. No fight. This window will get replaced.. ..but your neck can`t be? ls that clear? That rascal must have done it. You can tell from his antics. Definitely. - Don`t know why you have a problem with him. Why would he do that? He was just 15 when he wanted to join the team. We didn`t take him. He must be taking that out on us now. ls fifteen years any age to play? But Rooney played when he was 15. Shut up. - Sorry bro! Hey guys, who did this? lt must definitely be Sunny, that bastard. The other day he broke my window as well. But don`t worry. Let him break lf l don`t slaughter him.. l`ll stop playing football. Decide now if it will be.. ..an instantaneous chop or halal. Shut up. - Scoundrel Sunny. Come on boys, let`s get cracking. Come on. Go for it, Sunny. Great going. Hey, hurry up. Good. Keep it down. Give the ball. Paki bastard. What did you say? l called you a Paki, you got a problem with that? Hey, stop that. Are you done? Sunny, changing room. Now. Patrick! Sorry. - Now go on. Shake his hands. l had fallen. l play for Aston. l get paid 250 pounds a week. And that`s just till the selection. A player called me a Paki today. The management made him apologize. He apologized. This is my big year, dad. l will play this year. Today they`ve broken your nose. Tomorrow it will be your legs. Then it will be you. What you are running after today.. you will run away from it tomorrow. Your nose is still bleeding. lt might be fractured. - lt`s my nose. l can take care of it. Such arrogance! You can`t even handle your nose. One day it might just vanish. l play for Aston, not Southall. l am a doctor. You are all the same to me. Want me to look at it? You are scared of my brother, aren`t you? What`s this? - Football. What`s that? - Goal. My foot. Cross mark. Like Arjun, you should see only the fish`s eye. Okay? l want all of you.. ..one by one.. ..strike that cross mark, please. Can you do it? Come on, Monty Singh. Whose apples is he talking about? Come on, Monty uncle. Come on. l have never seen a goal ever move Right? So after you fix your target, keep your eyes only on the ball. come on, next. Good shot. - Hold it. Hang on. l must strike it a second time. l have to get it. Well done! Now you can shout. No, l`m playing.. but l remember. l will definitely bring it sweetie. Monty. - OK l`m leaving now. What was that? A phone call. - Whose? Sweetie`s.. ls there a problem? No.. No.. nothing. - What? She ran out of chilies. ln England they say football is life. England has 645 football clubs. One of them is Southall United Football Club. And just like every weekend A wedding was held here yesterday. These aren`t the grounds men. This is my team Southall United Football Club. We may be lndian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani But on this field we follow just one religion - Football. And l am Shaan Ali Khan, the captain of this team. Come on. This is my kingdom. l always won.. So want to be safe and make a goal.. Here take this money.. ..pay the rent today. Okay? Thanks Shaan, if it weren`t for you.. ..l would have returned to Dhaka ages ago lf that`s the case give it back. No, l won`t give it back. l will take it back from you. Yes darling. Green? Green coriander. Yes dear, l remember it. yes chilies of course. Good morning, uncle. - Hello uncle, good morning. Hey World Cup winner.. we need to get some chicken prepared. ..there is an order for a wedding! You love your chicken and lamb so much ..why this hatred for football? Shaan, a chick doesn`t come out of.. ..a hard boiled egg, does it? lf you fellows were to give up football all of Southall will start loving the game. lt`s not that bad. We are trying our best.. ..right now the club is struggling.. we are short of funds.. Money doesn`t make you good at the game. Playing good football will bring in the money!! Come on in now.. come on! All you think about is football! lt`s time you focus on work! Go inside. Dad, come on - Go. Hey Roops. - Hi. Shaan, l need to buy vegetables and these days Jenny tends to flare up. We better get going. She`s my wife pal not a thermometer. What`s it to you after a couple of beers your wife won`t bother you. You`re going to get me into trouble. Why don`t you understand? This is not lndia. You know you cannot put so much chilli in here. Use less chillies. How many times will l have to say? -Yes.. less chillies.. less. Relax.. relax.. otherwise he will also run away. And one day so will l. Promise? - Just look at the time, Shaan. lt is Saturday. l`m doing this all alone. And you`ve probably brought.. ..all your useless friends along. Quiet. - Football, football.. They have nothing better to do. Slow Jenny. - Let them listen.. They get free meals. You take care of their rent.. You even pay for bus tickets. Come on Jenny, l need to do this. lf they weren`t there.. ..then the club wouldn`t exist. You know that. Would you still do this if our family lived with us? Even if we had our own child? Waste your time and money on them? Yes l would. Just because l love them so much.. ..doesn`t mean that l don`t love you. Forget it now. Tell me you love me? l don`t. - Don`t joke. - Leave me. No. - Shaan. - l will not leave you. - Leave me. l will not. - Shaan, leave me. - l will not leave you. Akram! Please serve them kebabs. Yes ma`am. l love you. Serve them beer as well. Boy, l love you so much. Make that yesterday`s kebabs.. ..and mix in two glasses of water in the beer. You are very mean you know? Hey, Southall United. Awesome, we got beer. Hi. - Hi. Ranveer you should shower and come. When you come it feels as if.. ..you`ve brought the whole slaughterhouse along How many did you slaughter today? You worry about the vegetables you need to buy or you`ll have to sleep on an empty stomach. Hey are these yesterday`s kebabs? Shaan, why aren`t you having any? Why should l? Boys they are yesterday`s kebabs. Don`t have them. - l didn`t say they are yesterday`s Shweta, you have a great television show on football. You should cover us some time Do a story on Southall United Yes, Southall United. Hold on.. wait a minute. l certainly will. But do something worth featuring. Ouch! She hits where it hurts. You haven`t met Jenny? Go on.. say hi to her. Okay, l am going. Hey Bengal tiger why are you so serious? Our own taunt us, ridicule us. Are you talking about Shweta. Did you feel bad for what Shweta said? You might not be offended but l am. Shaan, tell me something Southall did reach the finals once, didn`t it? Yes. lt did. That`s why l`ve come here.. left Dhaka for England. Only for football. Even l want to win. Whoever plays to lose!? Debu, more than football we need to ensure that the kids aren`t put out of school. ln other clubs they get paid weekly Here we shell out from our own pockets. We have to win one match.. ..and look everything will change. Oh no. lf we get this property ..we`ll be in the money Ahluwalia! lt is a gold mine Anne . - Gold mine. Come on. - Come on. - So, here we are. Ahluwalia, here we`ll have the foodcourt ..next to it we`ll put up an eight screen multiplex. Madam, we proposed to have landscaping and trees.. ..all around that area. And a street running right through the middle. Hi. - Hi, l am Johnny. Johnny Bakshi. And this is Anne Fisher, chairman of the city council. - Hi. And this is Mr. Bhupendra Ahluwalia. He is Southall`s biggest builder. Come on. Come on. So you are a builder!? - Yes. We are here to meet the chairman of.. ..Southall United football club, Mr. Dhariwal. Mr. Dhariwal l am Anne Fisher from the city council. So, you are the owner of Southall.. ..United Football Club, is that correct? Yes. - Do you know why we requested this meeting? Mr. Dhariwal. you know that Southall City Council.. ..had allocated this plot.. ..for our club on a 30 year lease. But over the past eight years you haven`t paid the rent Considering that the local community.. ..would play here And l agree with you.. ..that is how it should be. lnstead Mr. Dhariwal Bhangra competitions are held here. Kebabs are sold here, weddings are organized. And the game that`s played here ..you can`t call it football! ln 25 years you haven`t won a single match. lt is a waste of land. Now the City Council desires that ln fact the people of Southall desire that a shopping mall be erected an amusement arcade come up for the kids so that the community can benefit from it. You know what l mean? You know, Ms. Anne.. We play football because we love the game. Johnny, you are one of us. You`re a football commentator. You should understand. - You are doing it for the money. Mr. Dhariwal, l am doing this for the community. No. How much. Three million pounds. Three million pounds. Mr. Dhariwal, you have 1 1 months. Ms. Fisher, we are not giving you the ground. And don`t mistake our silence for our weakness. Explain it to this Englishwoman. They had all the weapons, But we got lndia back.. ..without raising our hands even once. My father.. spent 40 years on the upkeep of this ground. For the last 100 years we`ve been playing on this ground. This ground was ours.. ..is ours.. ..and will always remain so. ln that case, gentlemen.. ..we have nothing more to discuss. Mr. Dhariwal, you have 1 1 months, to save the ground. The price is three million pounds, which you can`t pay. l have a brilliant idea. The championship league begins next month the prize money is three million pounds. Tell your captain, either you win the championship.. ..or vacate the ground. Good day to you, sir. All l wanted was to win a trophy. My time went by and that never happened. My business wound up. My property sold off. Even my house is mortgaged. All for the sake of this club. l have nothing more to give Wish l had a son. Why do you say that Uncle? Have l ever made you feel the lack of a son? As long as l am around ..no one will take this club away from us. l promise me you that. Uncle. Uncle. Now that Mr. Dhariwal has passed way.. ..there is no one around to fund and manage.. ..the Southall United Football Club. The City Council decided yesterday.. ..that at the end of this season.. ..they would take the ground back from the club. Southall United was started 100 years back.. ..is famous for defeating many top ranking teams. Famous footballers like Tony Singh have played here. Southall united is the first All Asian Football Club. ln 1985 it reached to the finals. But now, l hope it won`t be there. Very sad day for Asian Football in the UK. Shweta Singh for just football. To save the ground and win the championship we needed a coach. But who would coach us? Someone who loved Southall even more than l did. There was just one person, Tony Singh. Come on finish your game. Come on, pass this ball. Juggle, juggle, faster. Shaan. - That`s a goal. Come on. - You can see the spaces. - Oh! Tony, please. We need a coach, Tony. l am no coach. Tony! You are a great player. Why don`t you teach us to play like you did? Tony, Southall needs you. l have nothing to do with Southall. You were also once part of Southall. You don`t, just stay right there. These people don`t know who l am and who l was.. OK.. l want to keep it that way. Do you understand! Stay out of my life. Don`t come near me. Don`t try to meet me again. Tony the Council is bringing the club down. Tony, if what happened in 1985 was an act of weakness.. ..then right now you are being a coward. - Go away. You are a weak, defeated man. You are a failure. lf we start doubting ourselves.. ..how will we win the league? And we have to win the league. We have no other way out You are right. - We have to win it. Monty you are an experienced player. Why don`t you coach us? - Ok. We also have Aakash to help you out. - Sure. You guys can do it. And we are also there We are willing to do anything. l think together we can make this happen. Yes. Monty! Who is that? - Who is he? You are late. - Sorry coach. Where is the team? This is the best we have. Two things are required in football. The head and feet. The good news is you have both. But the bad news is.. ..what`s in between both ..is of no use at all. We need to check that first. He`s asking us to strip our clothes. l won`t strip. You. Monty Singh Walia coach. Yeah Monty. What are you doing? - Didn`t you tell us ..you wanted to check what`s in between.. ..the head and the feet. Monty That`s not what the coach meant. Pull it down, otherwise you`ll catch a chill. Sorry coach. So, you know what to do? Give me a 12-minute round. - Come on. Come on. Alright time to run. Come on. Come on. Come on Aakash, run faster. l am remembering my darling. - l am not able to run. Come on, brother Ranjit. Come on. Debu, please don`t fall. Brother Debu, what happened? get up. Come on, guys. Two more rounds. Mr. Tony, we will win, won`t we!? Come on guys. Move your legs. Move it. Move it. Move it. We need at 12 thousand pounds. We can`t afford grounds men and equipment. We will need to handle everything ourselves. What else do we need? Jersey and gear. This is all we have. Who will sponsor us? l will manage that. Now we need a bus.. ..with the banner of the Southall United Football Club. Yeah, that`s good. - Coach, that`s easy. Monty has a garage. Are they your family jewels? lt`s a bus we`re talking about.. ..not half a pound of meatballs! - You idiot! You will break my bones. - Shut up. Sunny, is Asson a good team? lt`s Aston, mom. Aston. lt`s the best team in this league. Do you have a chance? A chance? Mom, your son is the best. He is going to be a star starting tomorrow. Sunny, why don`t you join Southall? Because, mom, they only run after the ball. Poor fellows never manage to get hold of it.. Does your dad know that the selection is tomorrow? Yes, l know. Do you know, your son.. ..will get selected tomorrow. He is the best. Kavita, do you think that the English will.. ..select him because he is the best? He will know for a fact.. ..what he is pushing himself into tomorrow. Another new player. An lndian player. Aston and Sunny Bhasin. A weird combination indeed. Well, he must be good. - Of course. Playing practice matches and the championship are.. ..two different ball games. Beckham. Come down. Hey George, what`s up? hey, Zacky boy. Hey guys. Superb. Hey Zacky boy. Hey Beckham, where is your Victoria? Got you. - Hey, you got me. See you, bye. Unlucky. Boss. - Boss. - Yes. How can you do this to me? You told me. you played me the entire training session. You told me l was the best. The fastest. Or just leave it, boss. You always knew l was not playing lt is not about football. lt is about my color. What can l do, son? lt`s written on our faces.. ..that we are lndian. But you aren`t an lndian citizen.. ..the problem is you were born here. Do you understand? This is your fault. But don`t you worry.. is that clear? Whatever it is that you do.. you`ll do it better than the English. ls that clear. You will do it very well. Football is my only passion, Salim. Dear.. They won`t let you play.. Got it. They just won`t let you play. We are mere spectators to cheer them! But don`t you worry.. no more cheering from today. You English twits.. no more cheering from today.. That`s when you will understand. Where the hell is Monty? We are getting late. What happened? Monty forgot. - The mechanic is late again. Let`s go.. Where the hell is Monty? Look there. Come on. - Monty. Hey Monty. This is our bus. Let`s get going. - Come on. Hey, what are you doing? Wait. Monty. Very good, dear. Hail Goddess! Push it harder. Hey, it has started. Come on. Attack.. Beat the drums. - Beat the drums. After a goal. Goal on goal.. Goal on goal.. Guys. Today is our first match of this season. And even if you lose today.. ..you`ll still have a tomorrow. Whatever you have been doing so far, will go on. But do remember one thing. Play like men. Come on, let`s go. - Come on, let`s go. Welcome everyone to Paddock Wood football ground. This is Johnny Bakshi your commentator for.. ..the afternoon and with me here is Daniel. - Hello. Today is Southall United`s first match of the season. And we all know what`s bound to happen. Southall is ranked the lowest in the league.. and is also the weakest. And they are singing a song? No, that`s the anthem. That`s the Southall United Anthem. Goal on goal.. Chotu kicks off and passes the ball to their captain, Shaan. Debu receives the ball from Shaan and tries to control.. and move forward, but a fine tackle by Brian. Debu is down and unable to get up.. Because of his body weight. He seems to have hurt his back. Lovely pass on the Tom on the right side, he passes the ball to Frank. Paddock wood has kept the ball in.. ..possession and the ball is going to Southall now. He comes forward and.. What a goal! The goalkeeper didn`t see the ball coming.. Paddock Wood ahead by a goal. He`s trying to move forward.. and he dribbles the ball and moves ahead. He passes it once again.. The goalkeeper dives in to save, but they manage to score. Another goal for Paddock Wood! You butcher, you`ve ruined us. Get lost from here. You are flying like a wild cock. Who made him a goal keeper? Harry passes. Oh no.. the pass misses. The ball has reached to Jacob. Three, Nil Paddock Wood. Another goal from Paddock Wood. l have never seen anything like this. Harry moves around and passes it.. Shaan has the ball.. Shaan is trying to pass the ball, but.. ..Paddock Wood trying to regain the ball.. and four players have surrounded him. But not one Southall player to support him.. Shaan tries hard but other Southall players are way behind. And moving once again towards the Southall goal.. A brilliant right kick and a goal! lt`s their fourth goal! lt`s goal not eggs. How many will you eat? Hey, don`t teach me. Hey, are you doing goal keeping or shop keeping? Where are you guys? l am all alone here idiots. lt is half time here at Paddock Wood football ground. The half-time score is 4-0. Now we have the second half and let`s see what happens. The referee signals the second half. The Paddock Wood forward kicks it.. over Ranveer`s head.. and it`s a goal. Brilliant. The goal keeper isn`t watching. And it`s their fifth goal! Absolutely amazing. - Superb. Ball goes to Monty, from Monty to Ranveer and this.. You scoundrel! Wife`s stooge. - Only this was left now. By the way, this team need not make a goal. Monty. - Monty has made a goal on the wrong side. Pass ahead, not behind.. Tony Singh should teach his players, especially the goal post they need to strike. Pass ahead, not behind.. And the final score is.. ..Paddock Wood 6 and Southall United 0. That`s the funniest match l have ever seen. - There you are. Losers. 1 ,2,3,4,5.. You guys are losers. We had placed bets on 18-0. What were you guys doing? What could l do? l was the only one near the goal. Shouting out. But he didn`t pass. He thinks he is Pele. What`s your bloody problem? You know l can`t kick with my left leg. So then why play football? l can`t kick with my left leg. He was looking at the babes.. ..and obviously they scored. You mean l let them score? Who is the goalkeeper? You or l? What were the defenders doing? Loitering about? Please, l am telling you. Shut up! shut up! Behave yourselves. ldiots. He was watching girls. Why did he become a goal keeper then? Yes, l know. You shut up now. - We lost the match because of you. You only know to point on others. What can we do coach? l have thought of something. You do trust me, don`t you? Yes, coach. Sunny! Hi. l heard about what happened. Even you knew about it. l felt very sad for you.. ..but am not suprised. Exactly what my dad says. What will you do now, Sunny? l am the best. l will play for some other club. l really don`t know. But l will definitely play. Come to Southall, Sunny. Coach, neither do l run a restaurant.. ..nor do l sell meat. l do not have a garage.. and l don`t know how to play in a band. l only know how to play football. Tomorrow if you start working.. ..will you no longer be a player? They can`t take the ball away from me.. not even for ten seconds. That`s their caliber. lf you can`t tackle the ball away for ten minutes.. will you play for Southall? Who`s going to stop me? Tomorrow.. when do l need to reach.. coach? This isn`t just a game for us.. lt`s a fight to save our home.. ..we have to win this fight. Anyhow. Though we will now be playing this match for a draw. 0-0. lf we can`t score, we also don`t let them score. The ball should not get into the net. Are you with me? - Yes. Shaan. What are you doing here? l called Sunny here. Coach you are making a big mistake. Sorry, but l`m not here.. ..to solve your personal problems. l have come here for the club. Come on, we gotto go. You are late. Come on guys. Come on, let`s go. Come on. You like breaking windows, don`t you? Now hear your bones break! l just hope they get along. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Goal. Yes. Come on. Forward. - Back on. - Come on Debu. Come on. Pass the ball. Come on, man. - Come on, guys. Come on. - l am free. Fast, come on move it. Move it. Hey. - Come on. Here. - Easy. Easy. Come on, one second. - Bloody hell. Come on. You did something, didn`t you? l am going to look it later. Get on with the game. Come on guys. A pretty delicate nose.. it`s broken. Why did you have to do that? Because that Pathan is crazy. Don`t you want to get your nose fixed? Then don`t utter a word against my brother. l can break it completely. Why don`t you like my brother? l told you, he is an asshole. What were you saying? ls your whole family crazy? This is my nose! We live together, we`ve become alike. You will also become like us.. Asshole. You live alone? Yeah. - And your family? You don`t have many friends, do you? Why do you say that? l always see you alone. Will you go out with me? On a date. You really are crazy. l am quite sexy too! And so are you. Done. Yes. Don`t wet your nose for a few days. And if possible don`t get into a fight. Bye. Bye. Done. Shaan. What`s wrong with you? This was someone`s order. The customer is waiting for his meal.. To hell with the customers! Tell them the restaurant has shut down and the chef is no more. The chef is dead! Shit. l am fed up. Yes. - Hi. - Hi Shaan, how are you? Fine. ls Tony, there? - Yes of course, come on in. These are for you. - Lovely. Come on in. - Sure. Coach, Sunny will break the team. He could not be faithful to his parents.. his community.. How can he be a part of us? He is the sort.. who will betray those that feed him. He is not one of us. Nor can he ever be. Neither does he want to be a part of us. How can we play together coach? This bouquet of different flowers.. kept together looks very pretty, doesn`t it? Sit down, Shaan. Shaan. You are the captain. You decided to make me the coach. Now too, the decision is yours. You decide who stays and who doesn`t. You decide. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.. ..welcome to the Southall United Football Club. Today`s match between Southall United and Aston football club.. ..should be quite an interesting match. Ex-Aston player, Sunny Bhasin, is now with Southall. You are absolutely right, Johnny. lt should be an interesting match. Pass. Pass. - Go. Sunny! Oh come on, no. next time. A clash between Sunny and Patrick. You can see a lot of this today. Harry pass the ball. l was clear, man. Sunny was clear and near him. Why didn`t you pass to Sunny? - He was in front of you.. Are you teaching me how to play? Hey, what is happening? - Hey! Have you lost it? This is a match. What is your problem? Stop it. l said stop it. Go to your position. Come on. Chunan. - Chunan. Sunny is open! Chunan. Come on, pass. Hey, what dear. - Sober. Move it. And it is a goal. Brilliant goal. Sunny! No! But he misses the goal. - Hell. And that is the end of first half. Southall has missed a huge opportunity. get back to where did you come from. Paki. We will see who goes. -Shaan, you`ll need to run faster. lnstead of speed alone, if you would`ve used your head.. ..you could`ve seen me. Guys, not a bad half. There is another half. We can still do this. We can still do this, okay? Sunny you are moving too fast.. You have to slow down a bit, there are ten others with you. That was a clear opportunity coach.. lt wasn`t, you thought it was. Sunny, it is a team game, not a one man show. Why don`t you tell them.. ..why are you asking me slow down? You will do as l say. Come on, keep marking. Keep marking, move forward. Come on, Shaan, pass the ball. Come on, Shaan. Shaan, pass. - Release the ball, Sunny`s shot. Come on, Shaan. Don`t break this it, pass it, Shaan. Come on, l was here, man. Wrong move Shaan! Sunny was clear. Why didn`t you pass it to him? Now you will teach me. - what`s right and what`s wrong? Why did you call Tony if you wanted to play like this? Go to your position.. Get out. Ball back, come on. Terry is ready to take the corner against Southall. Sunny, back. - Ashley. You got good team here, Paki. Go to that ball. Don`t ever call me a Paki. This is absolutely shocking. - Sunny can play lndia.. Come on Ref. l think Ref has been a little lenient Jonny, that deserves a Red. What number you were in? - 8 -15. - Take it off. Sunny is being replaced.. Which is good. Another foul and he will get a red card.. and that is exactly what Aston wants. l am supposed to be out there. What the hell are you doing? Southall has to play a really top game to remain in this match. Harry. - Hey, pass the ball to me. Keep an eye on the keeper. Aston`s second goal! l told you, l was supposed to be there, coach. Hey, well done. Shit. lnstead of losing by three we could have won by two goals. Oh.. you would`ve saved the goals? What could l have done on my own? Are you the goalkeeper or am l? What were you defenders doing? You should focus on the ball, not the girls. Stupid. - Just wear your turban and go home.. Dare you talk about the turban with disrespect! l say, stop. - Don`t blame him. Talk about yourself. - Debu, move. Stop it, don`t fight. What are you doing? Stop it. - You will hit me? What`s wrong with you guys? You guys are all crazy! Whom are you calling crazy? Trash this scoundrel. He is calling us crazy. Hit him. Why are you hitting me? - Don`t spare him. Hit him. Don`t spare him. You are calling us crazy. - What is going on? - Who is he.. l am telling you. Don`t you talk nonsense with me! - He doesn`t pass.. Monty. You call yourself footballers. At least one of you is crying. l want you all to get ready and get in the bus in 10 minutes. All of you. You should be ashamed of yourselves. l`m glad about what you did to Patrick. He deserved it. That racist! This is Old Trafford. The Mecca of football. The Manchester United Stadium. On the other side of this tunnel is the Manchester United ground. People call this `The theater of dreams.` Look at the ground carefully, here where real champions play.. ..but their journey to success was not so easy. This clock was stopped on 6 February 1958.. at the time when the Manchester United team was returning.. ..from a match in Munich and their plane crashed. Eight players lost their lives. They were all under 25. Even their captain lost his life. They are all dead. But it`s unfortunate for you that you are alive. You don`t have a ground. They didn`t have a team. The team was finished. But they had a dream. A dream to win.. A dream to become champions. They never looked back. They practiced day and night.. and formed a new team. The fame, reputation and trophies.. are a result of that one dream. There isn`t a single championship they haven`t won. Look carefully, all around you.. This is the locker room. And only champions come here. These are the faces of champions. Look at their eyes.. their smiles. But l want to show you something else. What do you see? Whom do you see? Whom do you see there? Can you see? Do you see a footballer? Do you see a champion in there? You call yourself a footballer? See yourself. Look at your eyes.. look at your faces. What do you see? The faces of champions? Are these the faces of champions? l am fed up and tired of who passed.. ..and who didn`t pass. Bloody red chilli. l don`t care anymore. Are these the faces of champions? Don`t you want to be champions? lf you can`t play for anyone, play for the man in the mirror. We have tied a shroud on our head. We`ve move out of our houses with an oath.. Our heads, which are raised will never bow down.. The country will see and the world will see. We will be tough on everyone.. We are obstinate, we will never give up.. We have the strength. We have the courage. We have a desire to win.. The one who messes up with us will be ruined, as we all are crazy.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Come on, grow up guys. Come on, move it. Yes. Jenny. Jenny. What happened, baby? Are you okay? What`s wrong? You are pregnant. How did this happen? l am sorry, stupid question. A boy or a girl? l am sorry, another stupid question. You won`t do any work.. ..until we have the baby you will just lie on the bed. l`ll call the doctor. Okay? And he will he here all the time. There will be a nurse for 24 hours. And you please don`t worry. No moving. Shaan. - You are staying in the house, no kitchen. - Shaan. Relax. Relax. Since we have the desire, there is a fire within us.. We`ve lit this fire.. There is only one target in mind. Now it is the time to prove ourselves.. lt is a fight against them.. We will sacrifice our body and soul on the victory.. Who are we and what are we. We`ve moved out to prove that.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Hey dude, don`t mess with me.. Don`t mess with me.. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and.. ..welcome to the East Leighton football ground. To bring the national league this afternoon is Johnny Bakshi.. Southall is singing, what has become the trademark anthem. We will show the world what we are.. The mountains cannot stop us even if they want to.. We will do goal on goal.. Okay guys. Let`s go. Come on. Come on. What do you think Southall chances are today? Quite bleak, l can imagine. And Southall United Football starts with a kick off.. Pass it to Sunny. And they have lost the ball to East Leighton. Good move by East Leighton. Oh, that was a neat one. He goes pass Harry. Chances of a goal here. He takes the ball and.. And that`s a goal. East Leighton take the lead. 1-0. Come on, one more. One more! Absolutely brilliant. That`s it. Go for it. - Come on. Go boy. - Come on. Come on. Goal! - Yes. Yes! Southall team is 1 all. And it is a goal! Yes, come on. - What a brilliant come back by East Leighton. Go! Come on, bro! - Yes, come on. That brings the score to 2 all Referee takes a free kick with Southall ready to go. Southall on the attack again. - Pass here. Ali passes the ball to Shaan.. ..he moves ahead with it.. Shaan has fallen down. Oh God. - Shaan Take it easy. - Move. Move! - Careful. Shaan tackled to the ground.. Stretcher. Seems he has injured his leg.. l don`t think he is actually injured.. ..because he is going to come back in two minutes. Try and sit down.. Sunny now has the captain`s armband. There you are. Southall is on attack again. Good pass. Sunny is asking for the ball. Judan passed the ball.. Judan has the ball.. he passes it to Sunny.. and Sunny is tackled to the ground.. Come on get up, what are you pretending? He is alright. Nothing wrong. The referee calls the East Leighton captain.. And the penalty to Southall United. Yes! Wonderful. Who is that? - Sunny Bhasin. He can be dangerous. Hey! We did it, my friends! Okay, the party is on. Whom am l going out with? You, you, are you? He`s busy there but he`ll be dead when Shweta arrives. l`ll just be back. l was looking for you there, beautiful. How are you? You`re an amazing player! Okay, excuse me everybody, quiet, quiet, dear. Alright then.. quiet everybody. This is my number 10 jersey. My favourite t-shirt. You take it. That`s great! Awesome! lt`s for you. This is awesome! Okay. - Thank you. This is not fair. l`m giving you my favourite number 10 t-shirt.. and just a plain handshake. Give me a hug pal! Oh shut up! l want to gift you something.. for winning the match today.. ..close your eyes.. Hey. Come here. Wow! l was here for the beer.. l was just.. Going out, were you? Set your hair properly.. lf Shaan gets to know.. l`d come to get the beer.. Wait a minute! Do you trust him? Until you trust him completely, just stick to showing the beer. Billo, there is none.. ..other than you in the town.. She said, Billo. - Whoever sees.. ..asks one thing. - What? Whom does Billo belong to? Your every attitude gives birth to a dooms day.. Billo, every step of yours is like a lightening.. After falling for you, l`ve become crazy and ruined.. l`ve forgotten my name since l`ve heard your name.. After falling for you, l`ve become crazy and ruined.. l`ve forgotten my name since l`ve heard your name.. What do l think about these crazy guys.. Where do they stay and where they go is not known.. Their love is like the silk net.. Their craziness is a ploy.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. The garden of your embrace and your body is like the flowers.. Your fragrance is making me go crazy.. There is a sparkle in your eyes and the peg of your lips.. ..has a magic, which makes a man crazy.. Your talks are sweet, but.. ..yet l don`t believe them.. Your eyes shows me dreams, but.. ..l know you better.. You`ve stopped me on the way.. ..i am sure, there is a ploy in this. - lt is indeed a ploy. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Still you haven`t understood that even if you go around the world.. ..you`ll not find a lover like me.. Billo, my heartbeat is rising. There is a craving in my heart.. ..whenever you swing your waist.. Your intentions are bad and you are a sinner.. You are a betrayer.. Beloved, l know your intentions. Don`t mistake me to be a naive girl.. Why are you wearing an attire of a lover? You are bee which is thirsty for nectar.. Billo darling.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. l`ll sacrifice my life and my honesty for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Billo darling, if you say, l`ll sacrifice my life for you.. Where`s the beer? l`ll get it. -Leave some for me. Here`s the beer! Coach.. may l ask you something? Today you may ask anything.. Alright. What happened in 1985? We made it to the finals, didn`t we? Tell us! Coach, what happened in 1985? Tell us. Tell us, please. Come on, coach. The night before the finals l was at the pub.. ..a few English blokes walked in.. They said that l was a fluke. l don`t know how to play. One said that l should not play in the finals tomorrow. A sturdy Punjabi youth stood between us.. ..like a wall. The Punjabi didn`t let them touch me, not one scratch. He kept saying, ``Tony you`ll play the match tomorrow.`` Until he was conscious, he was fighting. Then fell. Then that English man came to me. One of them said that if l`d play the finals the next day.. they would do to me, my wife and child.. what they had done to the Punjabi. For the first time in my life l experienced real fear. l betrayed my fans, our club.. On the day of the finals.. l ran away. And who was he, the Punjabi who fought them? l don`t know his name.. ..but l can never forget his face.. lt is the face of a fan. A fan of Southall. l am very sorry. l, Monty Singh Walia.. at 2 in the morning.. swear in front of you.. that this time we will win the championship.. l`ll stand on this ground with the trophy. Yes.. like this, proudly! He must`ve paid money to get his photo published.. These guys do that. l am telling you. Did you see the papers? Southall United is everywhere! And Sunny`s picture too.. So cool. Jenny. What is she talking about? What are you saying Rumana? What? - You don`t need to be that excited.. it`s not your photo, it`s his. And what`s so great about him? Huh? l find him very sexy! What is she saying? She said, sexy. - Oh you, shut up. She said sexy. Shaan, relax. - What? - She said `relax.` l`ll whack you.. relax. What`s wrong with this family? Has everyone lost it? Are you in love with him? l don`t hate him, this l do know. Jenny, tell her that she can`t fall in love with Sunny. When did she say she loves him? She doesn`t hate him. Right? l know you also don`t hate him. But l love you. - And l love you too. Now you be quiet. - l love you too. - Shut up. You be silent. Ass. Listen, there is no need to get close to Sunny. Shaan, what happened to you? Last night you were very.. What did you say? Give me a hug! l was sloshed, had a lot to drink. l was out of my senses. l will need to find out more about him. Pass the ball, dude. - Come on. - Come on, boys. Come on, boys. Come on. - Here. Let`s go, here. Here. Pass the ball. Give me the ball. Ball. Why were you staring at me? l was staring? You`ve been staring at me since you got here. l was staring? Listen, you better concentrate on your game. You have a bright future. Yes, okay. Do you have a girlfriend? Yes. Do you love her? - Yes. Does she love you too? l guess so. Never said it though. You haven`t said or she hasn`t? Neither has. What is her name? Now that`s getting personal. l`m not your enemy, l`m your friend. What`s her name? This is my girlfriend, football. Good. Football. Can we play football now? Yes coach. Get well soon. Bloody liar! Come on. - Harry, pass it. Hey come on. Come on. Attack. Move forward.. ..and make goal on goal Come on, fast. We will show the world what we are.. The mountains cannot stop us even if they want to.. Southall are on a roll. With Southall after their amazing win gets sponsporship from Reebok. Goal on goal.. - Southall is absolutely performing fantastic. Goal on goal.. Attack. Move forward.. Goal on goal.. Welcome back, captain. - Thanks coach. We are a sword. We are like a wall.. Okay, let`s go boys. We are a sword. We are like a wall.. We fight for the victory.. ..we defeat others.. Nobody can defeat us in the battle.. What an amazing goal. The victory of Southall continues. The mountains cannot stop us even if they want to.. lt is the amazing job of Western Union The money of the sponsorship have come so soon. Hey brother Shaan. - See there. Here is the money. Hey congratulations! How much did we get? Just two thousand. Are you kidding? -What are you talking about? We were told it would be thirty thousand. Taxes were deducted. Hey, the taxes can`t be that high. lt`s thirty thousand in all! Go.. Go.. Go.. Go.. Go.. Just one player has transformed the fortunes of Southall United. Sunny Bhasin.. A one man show. Southall are going to rule. They were right at the bottom and now they are very high on the charts. And gaining momentum. Goal.. No matter somebody tries to stop us from left or right.. Right.. No matter somebody tries to stop us from left or right.. We are the gush of wind.. We are the gush of wind, which never stops.. Goal on goal.. Goal on goal.. Goal on goal.. Southall. Southall. Southall. Southall. Southall. Southall. Hey. Southall. You are the captain, aren`t you? Walk right in front. Southall is on the roll. Another win. - Another stunning performance by Sunny Bhasin. The day l saw them for the first time.. l`d cursed myself a lot. And now everything is falling into place. l find it difficult to believe.. ..the team is winning, the boys are on a high.. l am scared now. Why the anxiety? One bad match.. ..and everything would come to an end. Tony, you are being very negative. lt is not negative, it is logic. The other teams have seen our game.. ..they know our limitations. We don`t have options. Southall are on roll. Why don`t we go away for the weekend? You and l. Just the both of us? come on. Yeah. - Yeah. lt will be fun. Weekend. What a wonderful idea. lf only Sunny and Shaan could get along.. Shaan, a bit to that side. Sunny, a little to this side. Very good. Take it down and tie it up.. Take it down and tie it up.. With your bottom up. Take it down and tie it up.. With your bottom up. Take it down and tie it up.. With your bottom up. Take it down and tie it up.. With your bottom up. Take it down and tie it up.. Come on. Sunny, why don`t you sit here? Shaan sit right there. Both of you. Come on, pass. Open it! Cheers! - Sure. Look at me. Hello. Shweta! Your voice isn`t clear. Hi. - No, l`m alone.. What noise? A girl? How`s that possible? l`m watching TV.. Honestly, l`m alone in the room. Just watching TV. There`s no TV here.. You want me to switch the channel? channel Alright, l`ll switch to another one. Hold on. What do l do? Give me an idea, now. lt is a fine and sunny morning here and it is 21 degrees l promise to.. ..stay like that for rest of the week Sachin Tendulkar 99 runs off 82 balls. Mark coming far from pavilion and right time over the wicket. Oh my God. ln relation l am your father and my name is Shahensha. Are you lonesome tonight? will you miss me tonight.. All on the fours like that, give me some more.. What are you doing? You see Shweta, told you l was watching TV. l love you too, bye. We saved you, didn`t we? Thank you, guys. Thanks. - We saved you. We saved you. - Coach, thank you. You saved me. l didn`t do it for you. Her heart would`ve broken! l did it for her. There you go. - Let`s go, l`m very tired. - You guys go right up. Chotu, did you get it? Who is my room partner? Go right up. - l`m very sleepy. Monty, hang up pal! Come on Debu. Okay. - See you. - Let`s go. This is for me. This is for you boys. l won`t stay with him. No way. There`s just one key left. Do as you please. Good night. - Good night. This is not fair. Oh gosh. This is such a pain. Why don`t they have lights here? - Light. Light. No lights and now no hooks! Hey.. you sleep on the other side. There. l`ve been sleeping on this side since childhood. On the right.. You sleep on the left side. Crocked fellow. Will you fall off the bed if you sleep on that side? l`m quite high, don`t argue with me, l`m warning you. You are throwing stuff around.. You sleep on that side and l`ll sleep here. Thank you. Relax buddy. Why do you take everything so seriously? Why do you treat everything as a matter of life and death? Right, left.. Life and death. Football, life and death. Your ground, life and death. Listen.. These things aren`t less than life and death for me.. ..this is my last season.. Death. And if we do win.. ..you have no idea, how many Sunnys.. ..how many Shaans, how many Debashish.. ..will get a chance.. That`s life. Do you realize.. our club.. Southall United football club ..will be the topmost football club.. This dream of mine.. Sunny you can fulfill it. You can actually make it happen. l will not sit back and see Southall United win this year. They cant and l cant let that happen. Now you do whatever it takes, Johnny. Break legs, arms, hands, l don`t care. But do something. Done. - Don`t. done what? Mr. Ahluwalia spent a million pounds already. Now l want that land . - lt will be done. Better and when? - Tomorrow. She is even hotter when she is angry. Good day to you madam. Hi Sunny. - Hi. Nice house. Sunny, l`m representing one of the big clubs.. don`t ask me which one.. Reasons of confidentiality. What brings you here? We`ve seen you play all season.. seen your progress as a footballer and we are all very impressed.. ..but there`s a problem. l still can`t forget ..what Aston did to you. Bloody racists We need to answer back Sunny. And l have an offer. lf it`s not the best.. l`m not interested in it. Good. l like that. The first signs of a star. Go through this. And this is my card. No Asian has ever received such an offer. Actually, such offers don`t come by daily.. Check it out.. if you think this is the best offer.. Give a phone call and say yes. Thereafter, your career, your money, everything.. Done. Thank you, Sunny. Come on, Sunny. Let me handle everything. You don`t even need to talk. l would like you to meet Mr. Shepard chairman of the club. - Hi, sir. Would you like to sit down? - Sure. Have a drink. Some wine. No thanks. - Mona, hi. Can we have.. ..a bottle of wine, please? - Yes, sure. - Thank you. Sunny, Mr. Shepard has been watching you play. And is very interested in obtaining your service for his club. Of course, this club needs no introduction. lt is one of the finest in England. And this is our proposal for you. This is our offer.. lf you accept, a sports car as a gift. We give your own house. A four bedroom mansion. All my life.. l am feeling high today.. Wishing there was something just like this. Now that it is here.. A five year contract.. a 5000 pound weekly salary plus bonuses. And it is not that yet. Oh Sunny, hi. Girls are crazy for footballers.. the testosterone, the smell of sweat, it drives them mad! l wish.. l was one of them. You can get all of this once you join Millwall City Football Club. This is your chance to become a star. Add your name in the annals of football. To be counted along with the greatest. Deliver me.. This is an advance, a cheque for 25,000 pounds. And here is the key to your sports car. lt is all done. Just one more commitment. What? Starting today.. ..actually, starting right now, you can`t play for another team.. So from now on, no Southall United. What? Day after is the match. Miss the match. You will play many matches Sunny. Big league matches. Miss this one. But this wasn`t discussed earlier.. l know, l understand, but every detail isn`t discussed. And don`t say that here.. you can`t compare this club with Southall United.. listen to me Sunny.. ..what are you thinking about.. ..don`t worry about it. l`ll take care of things. l think it should be okay. Okay good. Well Mr. Bhasin, all looks good. Welcome to Millwal city. - Thank you. Excuse me. l have some wonderful news. What? What? Done. Sunny! Sunny come down! Come down, you jerk. Scoundrel! What is this Sunny? lt`s mentioned here that from today onwards you won`t play for Southall. You didn`t ask.. ..you should`ve at least told us what you are doing. He is a traitor, scoundrel. l am going to kill this guy. lt was fine until you were breaking window panes.. but today.. you`ve broken our trust.. You`ve stabbed us in the back. He is a true Englishman. We can never do something like this. Sunny you will never be happy.. Monty mortgaged his garage.. - Stop it, shut up! No! Saradarji! Let me speak. l`m telling you to stop. Don`t say a word. - No! Those ten thousand pounds in the donation box where do you think it came from? Monty gave it. By mortgaging his garage. She is lying, making up stuff. Don`t say such things. - No. Monty really did that! He mortgaged everything.. And what did you do!? lt is enough. He didn`t ask me before mortgaging the garage.. For God sake. l am a professional football player. This isn`t the first time someone has moved to another club.. Behave like men. What is wrong with you? After all, it is football. lt is not about football. lt`s about who we are.. ..it`s about how we`ll be known in this country.. our parents, our children it`s about them.. ..it`s about our identity.. ..which you have traded.. lt is not about football. Football. lt`s about our colour.. ..and about the pride in being who we are.. lt`s about being proud of our heritage.. lt`s about our name.. about our self respect.. and you`ve forced us to bow our heads in shame.. Why? Why?.. And that brings Southall number one on the charts. We are proud of our footballers. Southall has been playing an outstanding tournament. Southall has two more games to go.. One with Gatwick atheletic.. Harry what if we need to convert a penalty? Who is going to shoot? We don`t have Sunny. Monty Singh - Monty Singh. Right now we are one point ahead of Aston if we win tomorrow, we top the league. lf we were to lose then our last match is with Aston. What if it`s Aston!? So what!? What are you trying to say? lt`s Aston, we`re talking about.. We`ve already lost one match against them. lf we lose even one game now then this ground won`t be ours. Talk sense. They are the best team. And Sunny is not with us anymore. Look here. lt is not about Sunny, Bhasin lt is about Southall United Football Club. When we began this season, was Sunny with us? We have to win the league. Do you understand!? Talking nonsense. Debu, we will definitely win. Against Gatwick as well as Aston. Are the gloves comfortable? All the best, guys. Focus on the game. - Hey, you know your markings right? Right game. Monty we`ve decided that from.. ..the cheques we`ve received, we`ll pool in the funds and pay off the mortgage on the garage. - You moron! We need to get our club a lifeline. Yeah. - And what are you fellows worried about? l`ve mortgaged my garage.. not my honour. That`s the spirit! lf Southall United wins today`s match.. ..they will be this year`s combined counties league champions. A must win game for them. And this crucial tag ticks of with Gatwick. Shaan to Mayolene. A good pass and it goes down to Emry. Come on, Ranveer. Come on. - And that`s a good safe. Seems the goalkeeper has hurt his hand. But he is still on the field. And the game resumes. Come on. - Please do it. Harry! Block the ball in front of you. Try to shoot it! Are you okay? No! He is injured and is calling for a replacement. Aakash comes on to the field. Aakash in place of Ranveer. And after a whole season on the bench.. ..for this high pressure match.. ..he steps in as the goalkeeper. Abuil passed to Mac. Mac to Eff. Eff to Shawn and Shawn does a goal. Come on, do it. And it is a goal! 1-0 lead for Gatwick. Aakash is left clueless. His anticipation was wrong. The first goal against Southall. Sit down. Come on, sit here. We have to win this one.. ..if we want to win the championship. Coach.. you are saying `if` Even without the traitor, we can win.. Forget about him.. We won`t lose! That`s all l wanted to hear. l know you can do it. Pass it! Goal! Shaan has equalized. Come on. Good. Shaan. Come on. Come on. Let`s go. Foul. - l am taking it down. lt is a Southall penalty. And a foul by Gatwick.. He got in my way. Yes. Come on. - Monty! Go for it. Monty is lining up to take the penalty. lf Monty converts this penalty.. Southall will be in the lead for the championship title. And the last match with Aston would be a mere formality. But if he doesn`t, then they must defeat Aston. Southall very close to winning the championship. Come on Monty. And Monty misses the penalty! - Shit! Monty misses the penalty! And that`s the final whistle. The dreams that we saw.. ..are shattered in pieces now.. What shall l do now? What shall l do now? What shall l do now? What shall l do now? Oh God.. My God.. My God.. Sunny. - Hi mom. How`ve you been? We read about you in the papers. Kavita! lf you`ve come to tell us how much you are being paid and all that you`ve got.. like the others, we`ve also read about it in the papers.. And from this moment on.. our relationship is over. l am not talking to you. l`ve come to take her to my new house.. Come on mom.. Kavita! Kavita won`t go with you. What do you want from me? Now why do you object if l`m playing football? What you thought that nobody but the English could do.. l`ve done it, dad.. And dad.. l`m not an lndian.. l am a British National. l was born here. l belong here.. lf you love lndia so much.. ..why did you ever come here? You should`ve had me in lndia. Why are you confusing me? Why? What happened? Will you tell me? The shop-keeper refused to give me the bhelpuri.. He said, Go to Sunny`s house.. ..and have English bhelpuri with him. lt felt so humiliating. He said.. ..you bloody.. Your majesty.. ..your princess is here.. l beg your pardon, Anarkali. lt wasn`t his fault.. lt was my fault. Bye. Bye. l couldn`t understand that. l had to return this. l could`ve sent it.. ..but you wouldn`t know why l`m doing so. l can`t keep this. Or anything that is related to you.. You couldn`t honour the sentiments related to football.. then how can l expect you to honour my sentiments. You betrayed your own people. How can l trust you to stand by me? Why am l even complaining? lt`s not like you`ve changed.. you were always like this and still are.. Come on Asif.. - Rumana.. Everyone is angry with you. They don`t understand.. lf your brother gets a chance to play with Rooney.. ..what would you tell him? You are Rooney to me! Look after yourself.. Don`t you worry about me .. l`ll be fine. You just concentrate on match. We have to win. For the first time ever.. ..something is more important than football.. Football. League. Ground. Cup. None of these is above you. - Shaan! Nothing! l love you both. What is your pick for the final, Johnny? Aston without a doubt. They are playing well, they`re quick and they have the best coach. However, we can`t ignore one fact.. and that is Sunny Bhasin.. who is not playing with Southall United today. Hi, may l have a fresh lime soda, please? - One beer, please. Sunny. Sunny Bhasin. lt`s our Sunny. Son of great Jaidev Bhasin. Sunny. Today l`ve finally met you. Jaidev`s son is such a huge football star. Your dad is probably ecstatic with joy. He was always passionate about.. ..football, must`ve become fanatical now.. You know my dad? Do l know? What sort of a question is that? We were very close friends. For 13-14 years we drank together. We were very thick friends. Neither did he ever miss a Southall match nor did l.. He was Southall United`s most ardent fan.. ..what can l say about your dad.. He was such a huge star. He was such a huge star. And ever since that unfortunate night.. Your dad never came back. Which night? 1985.. it was the night before the 1985 final.. Southall had made it to the finals.. ..but the English couldn`t bear it.. ..they attacked Tony Singh.. ..he was your dad`s idol. He stood between them and Tony.. ..he fought with them till he could.. ..he fought for Southall United. He was a passionate fan. An avid supporter of Southall United. Today, they broke your nose.. Tomorrow it will be your legs. What you are running after today.. ..you will run away from it tomorrow. He longed for just one thing. That Southall United would one day be the champion.. He would often say.. My son will fulfill my dream. You might remember that when l first came to Southall United to meet you.. l`d thought what would l do with you? How could l possibly help you? The truth is.. l didn`t really help you.. ln fact you have helped me. The football player, who was hiding for 25 years.. ..so that no one would know his name.. Today when l am asked- Who me? Who am l? l am Tony Singh. Coach of the Southall United Football Club. A person gets just two or four chances during his life.. .. where he can make a difference.. During the 90 minutes on the field.. you will possess the ball only for two to four minutes. And it doesn`t matter if you are Zidane, Maradona, Pele or Beckham. lt`s their game in those four minutes that matters. So it`s what you do with the football during those four minutes.. that is crucial. We started this fight to save our club and ground. But today when the fight ends.. ..it should seem as though we have fought for our country. We have fought for Pakistan, Bangladesh, and lndia. Today we`ll play so well.. that every spectator will be proud of us. Today even the football will be proud of us. Even the losing team will be proud of our win today. Just remember one thing.. Go out there.. and win! Hello ladies and gentlemen. Johnny Bakshi, live from the Aston football ground.. lt seems today that.. those who aren`t present at the stadium are probably not Asian.. And the moment that every lndian, Pakistani.. and South Asian football fan was waiting for.. has finally arrived. Good luck, Tony. Attack.. Sorry. Goal on goal.. Who are we and what are we, we will show the world today.. Even the mountains can`t stop us.. `lf you can`t play for anybody..` `..play for that man in the mirror.` Goal on goal..
