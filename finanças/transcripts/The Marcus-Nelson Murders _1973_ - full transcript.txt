Kathy, how did it go? Melissa? Kathy, is that... Oh no! What... What are you doing here? How did you get in? No, please! Please don't hurt me! The hero of today's events is clearly Martin Luther King, who emerges as one of the most remarkable personalities of our country today. That is clear in the faces, the attitudes of the crowds here. - Melissa? In what kind today's events will effect the vast American public, has yet to be seen. Who could predict what the future holds for America. Whether all the years of hatred and racial violence, are a thing of the past. Hello! Whether we have now turned the corner. Jo-Ann, are you... Oh, I'm sorry! What's going on here? Kathy, don't do anything and he won't hurt you! Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Give me my glasses! I want to see you! I want to see what you look like! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Jo-Ann? Anybody home? Jerry, could you come over here, please? Come into the kitchen, Melissa! - Jerry! Come into the kitchen! What's going on here? Where's the phone? - Jerry, what? The phone! - Jerry! Yes. The police, please! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! - Jerry! No! It's in the bedroom. My name is Theo Kojak. It's interesting how matter-of-fact death can become. I can remember the first day in service. An automobile accident. There was a lot of blood. All over the car. I had to puke. Then there were 2 girls: mutilated beyond anything I'd ever seen. I could only look at it and wonder who did it. And why. But before we were through with the Marcus Nelson murders the Supreme Court will rock, laws of the country change, separating the country in two. And as for me: it would change the way I looked at my neighbor, my city, my country and myself. Nobody should die like that. That's the way chicken are executed. Why does it have to be Kojak to take charge of this investigation? We can't help who answers the first call on a homocide. Ah, there he is! - Hello inspector! Come on in? - Just for a minute! Still with the Italian suits I see. - I'm very happy you noticed. When I was a kid, I promised myself two things: number one, that I'd be rich... and number two, that I'd stop wearing my big brother's clothes. Well, I ain't rich, but at least I dress well. We have to put more men on the case. - How many? Homocide experts from all over the town. - How many? About a hundred. - Why don't you make a five hundred? What do you mean? - Why don't you make it a thousand? Kojak, after everything we've just gone through with you... Murder on girls is just the way of life in Manhattan. The parents are not only solid citizens, they're also celebrities. You're gonna have to cooperate with us. All of the detectives are falling over at the thought of promotion. It's not your business to determine policy. - No, that's yours. They're going to meet up with the others in the morning at the scene of the crime. Welcome to the national policemen's convention. It's so good to know that the community's being protected by such strong representatives from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens... Hey, Staten Island! Oh yes, Staten Island! A matter of your interest to you I'm sure: his point of access. There's a doorman downstairs, I'm sure you've noticed. He says, no one was admitted into the apartment at the time of the murders. There's also a service entrance downstairs. The door locks automatically. Surely someone could've climbed the wall... But the nearest ledge is eight feet away. So that means... the murderer would've to be a cat burglar or a circus performer, which isn't very likely. Ok, follow me! The murder weapons were in the bedroom sink. Follow the trail. The bodies were lying here, bound together by strips of sheet. The blinds were drawn, window open, clock stopped at 10:37. That might indicate something and it might not. Any questions? You like making phone calls. I got some records here of some of your calls. They're kinda spicy. Now take a look at this! Would you say that was one of your better calls? I understand you have a tendency to knock girls down after a few drinks. You worked with Jo-Ann Marcus? Well, thanks for co-operating. That will be all. That was the largest manhunt in New York's history: Investigation of everyone who knew the murdered girls. Chief source of reference: Jo-Ann Marcus's address book. The number of names it contained: 565. Oh yeah, quite a spectacle. All those red-blooded American boys out there, trying to get ahead, just like me. In Bronx and Brooklyn, far from the middle-class protected community in which Jo-Ann Marcus and Kathy Nelson died, Ethel Larson came out of a bar at three o'clock in the morning, six months later. You'll find Harry! - Would be nice, Baby. - Later! Go away from me! Aha! A few days after the death of Ethel Larson, a few blocks away, another unrelated incident happened. I think I got something going down. Get away from me! Hey, what are you doing? Help! - Police! Stop, or I'll shoot! All right, ladies! This guy, how old was he? How old? 25, 26. 5'10''? - Yeah, 5'10'. How much he weigh? 160? 165? - Yes I got something for you. I got a button from his coat. The next morning, policeman Stabile went looking for suspects. Hey! What you're doing in there? Trying to keep warm. Come out here! Got the guy from last night? - What guy? The guy you were shooting at. - What do you know about that? I... I was walking down, left my aunt's house, and... and this guy came running around the corner. He said: Hide me! I said: Man, I can't hide you! He took off somewhere. - Where did he go? I think he went down that way. Think you'd recognize this guy if you saw him again? I don't know, man. It was kinda dark. Tell you what, you and I'll take a little walk. Come on. Come on! What did he do? - He tried to rape a woman. Wait a moment! Stabile, post 16. I got a witness here of that attempted rape. Hey kid, what's your name? Lewis Humes. - How do you spell that? H-U-M-E-S. Lewis Humes. H-U-M-E-S. Yeah, okay. This is my brother. What's your name? - Abe. Sir, can we please go now? We're trying to find a job. Where are you going now? - To the Durban Salt Company. What is the address? - At Pitkin. Okay! What did you get yourself into now? - I've seen this guy they're chasing now. What are you supposed to be? Some kind of a reporter or something? Didn't I tell you, you can't say nothing. It means trouble. I didn't do anything. - You don't have to do nothing to get in trouble. Are you some kind of a dope, or something? Always have to say: I've seen nothing, I know nothing! Did you remember to bring your social security card? I lost it! - What?! Are you totally nuts? Who is he? - Suspect 985. He used to date Marcus. Someone saw them arguing. His name is Ryan McNelly, age 24, freelance writer. He was in Washington D.C. at the time of the homocides. I should've checked the files more carefully. That's what happens when half of the police forces are on one case. They have a tendency to fall all over each other. - Want some coffee? Hey, you want some coffee? - I'll catch you later! Ruthie! Ruthie! You don't remember me, do you? - I remember you! Everything is so expensive! I got out of the market, I can't believe my bill. This is as good and cheaper. I didn't know you lived around here. Where is Jack, isn't that the guy you then married? It's over. - Oho, welcome to the club! What did you run away for? I got fat. You're not fat. No that, try that. No big brand name at it, but it's just as good. - You know your stuff! I'm a great cook! - You? How about we're cooking up some chili? I make a great chili! Why go back into the past? Let's leave it like this. There aren't so many things back to remember. You're someone I remember. Hey Dan, how are things in Manhattan? Not better than usual. - Got any leads? No. - About time. Youve been working long enough on it. No visitors allowed. Hey Al! - Yeah? The attempted rape sounds like the Nelson murder. Same area, Pitkin Avenue, same technique. Didn't you notice that? - No. What about the witness? How's he? That was just a silly boy. Just a silly boy? What's his address? He says he works at the Durban Salt Company. Go over him with Bishop. Immediately! Ok. There he is! Hey, young man! Would you answer me some questions? Here, police! Are you the one who saw a man running away from the police? Yeah, that's me. - May I see your identification? Seems like I've left it at home. Have you got anything else with your name on? I got a couple of letters. - All right, let's see. Lewis Humes? Why'd you say you worked at the Durban Salt Company? I was going to, but I lost my social security card. Well, maybe you can help us. Are you coming with us to the station? Okay, Lewis. Have a seat over here. All right? Right down here. Sergeant? Hey, if anybody goes out for coffee I'll take a regular. Humes? Come with me please. Why? - Don't worry, it won't take long. Relax. Yeah, thank you. I'll catch you later. Mrs. Alvarez? There's someone I want you to see. - Who? Just step right in here, okay? - Who? Don't worry about it. Right there. I want you to do me a favor, ok? Would you stand right here? - Here? - Exactly. Well, is that him? I'd like to hear him say something. Please repeat after me: Lady, I'm gonna rape you. Lady, I'm gonna kill you. What's wrong? - Just say the words, ok? What for? - Just say it. What's wrong? - Just say the words. Why I'm saying all this? Just do me a favor. Lewis, please. Lady, I'm gonna rape you. Lady, I'm gonna kill you. - A little louder. Lady, I'm gonna rape you. Lady, I'm gonna kill you. Mrs. Alvarez, that's fine. Sit down, okay? Sit down over here, ok? Come on. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. Mrs. Alvarez, please. This lady says you were trying to rape her. - What? I don't even know her! Lady, you've make a mistake! You can't just say something like that! Take care of Mrs. Alvarez, will you? - Mrs. Alvarez, you come with me, ok? Lewis Humes, you're under arrest. - For what? Come on! - But how can can you say it was me? That's the way it goes... - But why? I wasn't... You're not stuck for money! Come on, Lewis! Let's go! It wasn't like it was before. Was it? Better! You always were of a strickenly- fashonable gallantry, weren't you? What you've been doing with yourself, Ruthie? I'm a nurse. - A nurse? I had to do something. You know, after the divorce. Good for you! - And you're still a cop? - Oh, yeah! You can't kick it, ha? Why not? - I don't know! I thought at first I was doing it to support the wife put the braces on the kids' teeth. And now the braces are gone, and so is my wife. Habit maybe. Or there's more to it. I don't know. That's the one thing about you I could never get with. I don't like most cops I know either. But who else would put their lives on a line at these prices? I think you're wasting yourself. I don't know if I ever had more to offer in the first place. Cigarette? - No, I gave up smoking. Kiss? Cabot should come over here and get his confession. - I'm on the line now! What's up? - They got the attempted rape and the Nelson murder. Where are you going? I gotta make a list with that. - Yeah, yeah. I'll be back soon. I wanna talk to him - Who? Your suspect. - Suspect? Now we got it all. The Nelson thing, too. - I wanna talk to him. There's nothing to talk about. Lewis, this is detective Corrigan. He wants to ask you a few questions. You've been telling us the truth so far, so keep telling us the truth. You haven't got enough? Whose picture is this? Mine. The girls, where are they from? - From Jersey. Jersey? Where in Jersey? - In Bayside. They live on a ranch and raise horses. What are their names? One of them is called Louise. I can't hear you. I said, one of them is named Louise. What's the other one's name? Can't remember. Tell him the truth. One of them was in my class in school. - Why would she give you a picture? I found it in the dump outside my house. And I kept it. You want us to believe that? Why did you keep it? Tell him the truth, Lewis! Because I liked her. - Because you what? I liked her. I always liked her. I just wanted to pretend that I knew her. I used to show the picture to people, to make them think I know that girl. Tell me, Lewis, you recognize these knives? No. No. How did you come into the room? - Through the open door. What did you do? I went into the kitchen. At 2:30 the following morning, assisstant District Attorney, Mr. Michael Cabot arrived, accompanied by the detectives Tanner and Green. They took down this confession from Lewis Humes. She came in. What was she wearing? She had no more but a towel. What did she have from the waist up? Nothing. Did you or she say anything then? That's when she started screaming and yelling. What'd you do then? I grabbed her and told her to shut up. How did you grab her? I grabbed her from the back, I grabbed her about her neck. What happened right then, after you dropped her into the bedroom? I hit her with a bottle. - What did you do when it broke? I tied her up. - How did you tie her up? With the sheets which she had covered her body with. What happened then? That's when her mother came in. Why you're saying it was her mother? That's what I understood, it was her mother. What did you do then? I got up and I told her to be quiet. She started screaming and yelling, and then I ran over. You ran over to her? And I grabbed her. - What did you do then? I started to have intercourse with her. You started to have what? - I said, I started to, before she came to. What happened when she came to? She started to scream and yell again. What did you do then? - Ran into the kitchen. Why did you run into the kitchen? - I was trying to find a knife. What did you do? I started stabbing her. Why did you do that? - Satisfaction. Satisfaction? For what? I don't know. I was angry. Then I ran into the bathroom. Why did you run into the bathroom? - To wash the blood off. Off my hands. - Did you go back into the bedroom? Before I left the bedroom, I pulled the shades down. Why did you pull down the shades? Because if they'd get to, they would get off. The two girls you cut? And then the people in the next apartment might see them tied up. Inspector Hofstetter of Brooklyn police law enforcement arrived that evening. How the hell am I supposed to know? - Good evening, inspector. Oh, inspector! What have you got? - A picture in his wallet of Jo-Ann Marcus. What else? - A confession. How much of a confession? - 61 pages! What else? - We have a diagram of the Marcus Nelson apartment. I'm sorry, I couldn't get it any sooner. How's the woman? - She died. Does it bother you? - No, you could see it coming for a while. Hey, the blinds I was making, I brought them. Am I trying to domesticate you too much? That question is a little too weighty for this hour in the morning. Yeah? Where? Brownsville! Right away! What is it? - The Marcus Nelson thing! Do you have to go now? - Well, either I gotta give up the police, or you gotta give up nursing. Maybe it's too late for either of us to give up anything for the other. You want me to wait for you here? I'll call you at your place later. That's daft! We beat our brains up, track down every clue for months, and those Brooklyn hicks, they stumble on it. Hello, inspector! - Where is he? - Right this way, Sir! Just like New Year's Eve! -They've got something to celebrate. Tell us once more how you took the knives from the drawer. Hello Frank. I looked into the drawer. The kitchen-table drawer? - Yes. Were there knives in there? How many knives did you grab? I got about three. Which one did you use? The butcher's knife. Well? Details up to the the number of knives he picked up. Talks about it like he was talking about drinking water. Are you surprised by anything now, Frank? - Not much. What's your name? - Corrigan, Sir. - Good work. - Thank you, Sir. Copy of his confession. Give it to the lieutenant. I'll talk to him myself. Lewis Humes took the subway over to Manhattan. He wandered up hazardly into the Marcus Nelson apartment. Once he got inside the apartment... There are some things I want to go over with you. A few things are a little vague. - It doesn't say how he got into the building. Maybe he got into the service door. - It locks automatically. Maybe it don't work that well all the time. - Maybe. How about the blood? He washed his hands. I mean the clothes. He had it all over him. Did he tell you he changed some place? No. - Are you sure this is Jo-Ann Marcus? Come on. What do you think? She's blonde. Hey kid, you want to say anything to me? No, I don't want to say anything to you. Miss Karr, I'm sorry to bust in at this hour. - Come on in. Thank you. - What is it? They picked up somebody in Brooklyn. Maybe he's the guy we're looking for. Could this be a picture of Jo-Ann Marcus? That's so old and faded. - Take your time. No, that's not her. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Melissa Karr will not identify the photograph. That doesn't mean that he didn't find it in her apartment. Want a cigarette? - No, thanks. What you think they'll do with me? -The charges against you are pretty serious. What are the charges? You swear, that you arrested Lewis Humes on a charge of homocide in that the defendant herein mention did stab and cut with the knife about the throat, neck and body of Jo-Ann Marcus and Kathy Nelson, that resulted in death? - I swear! Lewis Humes, you have a lawyer? I can't hear you. I don't think he can afford a lawyer, Your Honor. - Let him speak for himself. Is there a lawyer in the court now? - Yes, judge. Mr. Maurice Fisher. - Will you make your presence known to the court? Right here, Sir. - Mr. Fisher, do you want to assist this court? Yes, sir! You take the defendant over there so he can consult with council. Thank you. Lewis, Lewis...did you hear the charges that they have against you? They ain't true. Not true? You confessed to them. - They made me. What do you mean, they made you? - They made me. How? They beat me up and they scared me. Lewis, they have 60 pages, right here and in your own words. I ain't do nothing! So what do you want me to tell them? Are you sure? Okay. Your Honor. Your Honor, it seems that I'm the first person the defendant had the opportunity to discuss this with. Not including the police officials. The defendant states that the confessions, were made under duress threats. I think the officers should be commanded in this matter. I mean I know that this man has been wanted for quite some time for this murders. I think a lot of people can rest a lot easier now that he's been apprehended. Your Honor, the court pleads... - Excuse me, council. Without saying or complying any innocence or guilt in this matter, the people of this town are pleased with the arrest for murder in this case. which they've been very much concerned. I think the police department does a fine, effective job. They do it efficiently and properly. This court commends the police department city of New York. The people of this town are gonna have much more respect and confidence in law enforcement now than 2 or 3 days ago, in relationship to these two major crimes. Officer, bring the defendant to the bar. Lewis Humes, I order you to be held without bail until it is determined by Grand Jury whether you should be indicted. And if so, on what charges. Over here, Dan! - Hey, Dan! - Hey Marge, did you see this? Yes. - It's in all the newspapers. - What do you say about it? Corrigan promoted to Lieutenant and given special vacation leave. You can see how much he loves the force. He deserves one. Congratulations again, Dan! - For what? Having such a beautiful wife? - Oh, Dan! - You get more beautiful every day! Hey, look who's here! How are you guys taking it in Manhattan? - We'll survive. Dan, can I talk to you for a minute? - I'm on vacation here. You know, about the confession, there are a few things in it that... You wanna know what inspector said? There are more details in that confession than in any case he can rememeber. Why did he call that Nelson girl the mother? - Talk to the inspector. Let's go, Marge. Sit down. I ain't talking to nobody. - I said, sit down! Did a lot of talking to them, now you're gonna do a lot of talking to me. What are you here for? - I'm a cop. And you said that cops are trying to lynch you. Well, I'm not a lyncher and neither are they. Maybe they was just trying to make points. That's a lie! And you know it. Well? Why should I want to talk to you? I already did enough talking. - Makes me believe you. Makes me believe you're not telling a lie. How? - Tell me what they said. Exactly what they said. Then I'll know if you're telling a lie or if you're telling the truth. First they take you in there, and then... - Names. What? - I gotta have names. A young cop and... - Stabile? ... and Black, the tough one. He'll scare anyone. Now what did he say? I gotta have the words! All right Lewis. Are you ready to tell us the truth? I have been telling the truth. - We know you tried to rape that woman. Stand up. Face to chair. Okay. Did you try to rape that woman? No, I didn't do nothing. Take it easy. Look at me. Look at me. I'm gonna tell you exactly what happened. You were looking for some white stuff, you were cruising around... - No! ...you saw that pretty girl. - No, I never seen her before. You grabbed her and you tried to rape her. This is your last chance! Tell me the truth. I've never seen her before. - Tell me the truth, Lewis! I didn't do nothing. That's what you say. Now I tell you what they say. Cigarette? - Thanks. I know I need help. Can you help me? Lewis, you'll have to ask a lawyer or a judge. They can help. You been as nice as my own father. You've been nicer than my own father. You'll find the truth anyway, right? - You don't have to tell us anything. But if you do talk to us, we want the truth. Nothing else. Okay? It's a lie. - They say they didn't even raise their voices to you. They're gonna testify to that. It's a lie. - Words! Names! Tell me everything you remember. The older one. - Jacarrino? - Jacarrino. He says: don't you even touch this boy. I won't stand for it. He pretends like he's your friend. He pretends to be better than your own father. I know, it must seem like the end of the world to you. But that's not necessary. Lewis, what were you doing out in the town at night? I didn't have a place to sleep. - You didn't have a place to sleep? See, my mother come from Seaview and my father now split up. We all came with her. Because I got a job. But I lost it. Where did you sleep? - I slept in hallways. Why didn't you call your parents? My dad and I don't get along too good. You don't look like a guy who's hard to get along with me. Is it bad for me? - I don't know yet, Lewis. Let's put our heads together. The questions are gonna come fast. And they have the button to your coat. The button from the coat isn't mine. I lost mine a long time ago. How did you lose it? - I don't know. The woman claimed she saw you. If you were them, what would you believe? You? Or her? He said, nobody would believe me. They'll find out everything about you. Even your dreams. Then they'll use it against me. You wanna trust somebody. What are you gonna do, when you get out of this, Lewis? You think I will? I'm gonna do everything I can to help. What do you want to do for a life? I wanna go to the Navy. - Why the Navy? 'Cause you can learn there better than anywhere else. - And later? Don't laugh. - I'm not laughing. Who's laughing? I want to be an artist. 61 pages of confession! After a while you just break down and say yes. You think, you never gonna get out of it unless you do it. You confessed to the murders of 3 women. - I dind't know I was confessing. First time I knew was murder was when I was in the court. He fooled me! He fooled you? Just a few more questions, Lewis. Lewis, just a little more. Come on, get your head up. Just a little more work. What happened... - I wanna know what happened to those girls. What? - The girls we're talking about in the apartment. Are they alright again, or what? What's the matter Lewis? What is it? Are you worried about the girls? Look, I'm gonna give them a call. Okay? Were them girls cut bad? Have a cigarette, Lewie. How many of those things you smoked, Lewis? I don't know. Well you oughta cut down. The stuff is poison. Here, have a sandwich. I don't want nothin' else to eat. I already had too much. Well I talked to 'em. They're not mad at you. And none of the others said anything about that phone call? No. You drew a diagram of the mordered girls' apartment. This is the diagram. Which part did they help you with? Something wrong with your eyes? - I can't see too good. Where are your glasses?. - I ain't got none. I never had the money. Excuse me Lt., they've got his mother out there. - Alright, send her in. Right. Ma? Ma? Oh my God. Ma! Son, what happened to you? - They picked me up, ma. They made me confess to them crimes. Are you gonna stay here or are you gonna go back to Seaview? 'Course I'm gonna stay here with you. I was alone, ma. I was the only colored person there. I went over the confession all morning. It seems to be alright. Do you have any doubts about it? Hey look, Dan, I asked you once, let me ask you again. Why did the kid call Kathy 'the mother'? Ask him, not me. Sit down, sit. - Thank you, sir. Why did he say he pulled down the shades in the apartment so that if they came to, no one would see them? He cut them to ribbons, he must have known that they weren't coming to. Mr. Goodman, I don't know why you said that. The diagram of the apartment, did he draw it all? - His initials are all over it. Two different pens did it. What are you suggesting? I drew the diagram myself? This photograph... No one will identify it as Jo-Ann Marcus. I told him, it doesn't mean he couldn't find it in the apartment. Could be a picture of someone else but he still may have found it in the apartment. How do you know he was lying when he said he found it in Seaview? I know when they lie, their stomachs move in and out. Whose stomachs? Come on! "Whose stomachs?" Look, I know 'em. I worked in Brownsville a long time. Is there anything else? - No, no. That's all for now. Well if there is, would you please contact the D.A.'s office in Brooklyn? I'm working on a new case to them. They don't want me off the job. See ya. Can there really be something wrong with this? What do you think? It's not only him. It's the Brooklyn and Manhattan P.Ds, the D.A.'s office, your's and mine. What are you gonna do about it? - What can we do about it? Take the photograph. Corrigan says that Hume got it from the apartment. And Humes says he got it in Seaview. Can I take this? - Yeah. That's how we'll find out who's really telling the truth. What's that? - What? Up there! - The right hand corner? Right here. - I don't know. Is that sandy stretch abroad pathway? Could even be a river. This doesn't look like the place at all. - You said the photo is 10 years old. These trees have grown a lot since then. What's these stretches under the air? Used to be a lake here. The vegetation's covered it over. Thank you officer. Come on let's get to a police station. Yeah, you know that looks like Travis' daughter. Travis? - Yeah he used to be mayor. He owns a service station down there. Thank you. - Sure thing. He'll be back after lunch, About a half hour? - Yeah, let me see that again. That doesn't look like Ilene. You know who this looks like? This looks like Lynn Peyser. Where does she live? - Right around the corner. We got about a half hour. - Thanks. Where did you get this picture? - Is this your picture? Yes, we took it right after graduation. Pigtails. Some of us went up to Mount Jersey woods. Excuse all this mess... - That's alright. Now Miss Peyser, this is very important. What happened to that picture? I don't know. It was boucing around the house. My mother threw it away. When was that? Spring cleaning. May, June. Alright. Well? They won't drop the indictment. Say they don't have enough. You don't think I like it, do you? The whole thing started with the picture. Well it isn't the girls picture, what are they gonna do? Well, we'll proceed slowly. We'll investigate everything. We don't want to make any statements this time to embarrass Brooklyn. Embarrass Brooklyn? Well if Brooklyn could be embarrassed, it would've dropped dead years ago. Anybody talk to Brooklyn? - Yeah. And? - They said they weren't interested in hearing any fairytales. Fairytales, huh? Too many promotions and citations are involved. That's the ballgame. Brooklyn's law enforcement is on trial, isn't it? That's what they mean! Theo, we can't delay the legalities on this case. Besides, you don't even have enough for... The press is here, sir. - Send them in. When there're more developments you'll let us know. Why the earth-shaking urgency about this case? What's the damn hurry about this case? - Nothin' at all. Just that I happen to care about law and order. That's all. Hi Theo, what're you doing here? Something wrong in the Humes case? Wrong? Why should anything be wrong? - I don't know. C'mon, why hasn't Manhatten moved on the indictment against Humes? We aren't responsible for Manhattan. We know what we're doing here. What? - I'll tell you what. We'll try Humes within the next two weeks. Well, that's news. You can quote me on that. Shouldn't the Marcus-Nelson murders be dealt with first, Mario? I told you, we're not responsible for what they do in Manhattan. We're responsible for Brooklyn. - This reminds me of Sacco-Vanzetti. You've got the nerve to compare this to the Sacco-Venzetti Case? - Yeah. My parents fought for Sacco-Vanzetti. - How is it comparible? - Tell me. They first tried them on a minor charge too. It helped both cases. Not comparison. - Wait a minute...what do you mean? In a case, where you try a man first on a lesser charge, the jury has already figured him guilty in their minds. The kid is guilty. - Mario, you know the score. Once he's had a conviction, the jury at the next trial hangs him too, because they figure he's guilty of something. Mrs. Humes, I'm seeing you because of my friendship with Mr Seligman who used to work with me. I've been following your son's case. He has a lawyer, doesn't he? The court gave him one, yes, but he don't have trial experience. The woman he was supposed to have tried to rape, identified him, they've got a confession, they even found the murdered girls photo in his wallet. He's innocent. Even if he is,, the truth doesn't count for much in a courtroom. - Jake! I'm sorry Saul, but I believe in telling the truth in these matters. I believe in that. They've got enough to convict your son ten times. They said you saved men. - I can't save your son. The publicity, confession, the whole atmosphere makes it impossible. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Goodbye. A nice woman, Saul. Managed to say goodbye even though I told her I couldn't save her son. Now you get out of here. If you ever bring anyone in here again making false promises, I'll kill you. Lewis, how you feelin'? Sit down. Listen, I'm going to recommend something. I made a deal with the judge. He'll give you life. Life?! Face it, two homicides in Manhattan, attempted rape, and a homicide here. That's a good deal, Lewis. How's it a good deal when I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in jail? For something I didn't even do? What chance do you have? It's your. word against two police departmants. No! No more deals! He said, "Let me touch you." Then he put his hand under my coat. And said he wanted to have intercourse with me. What was his exact language? I want to have sexual relations. I'm gonna rape you. Then I got hold of his hands and then his coat. Then I started screaming. You recognize this coat? That looks like the coat the man was wearing that night. The man who was following me and then attacked. And this button? You tore this from the coat of the man? Yes. - Thank you. Mrs Alvarez, do you see the man in this court who followed you and attacked you? Yes. - Think you could walk over and tap him on the shoulder? Let the record show that Mrs. Alvarez tapped the defendant on the shoulder. No further questions. Detective Black, how long have you been with the force? - Eleven. Ever received any citations for bravery? I have. How many? - 19. Have you ever subjected a defendant at any time to duress or threats? No. Have you ever subjected any suspect to duress or threats? Never. Then how did you get the confession out of the defendant? On a pad like this, and in his own words. He cooperated completely? - Absolutely. Completely. Thank you, no further questions. Detective Jacarrino, when you came into the precinct, did you see evidence of beating or coersion of the defendant? - No. No. Did you see any bruises on his face or his body? Could you speak up please? - No! - Thank you. Detective, did you personally speak with Lewis Humes, the day he arrived at the precinct? Yes. - What did you two talk about? We had a casual conversation. - What was it about? We talked about his background. I asked if he.... been working, he said yes but he hadn't worked steadily. Did he tell you why? - He said he had problems. What kind of problems? - People, he had problems with people. Problems with people. Did he tell you anything else about his job? He said he'd sometimes gotten into arguments and quit the job or be dismissed by his employer. Did he discuss at any time the attempted rape? Yes. We'll he must have said more than that. Can you elaborate for the court? He said he put his hand under her dress and said, "Shut up or I'll kill you." That's sufficient for me, your Honor. They stood me in front of the chair... and they called me a liar. I told them that, if I said I did it... Your Honor, could you please ask him to speak up. I can't hear a word. I told them that, if I said I did it, that I'd be lying. Every time I said I didn't do it I got knocked back down in the chair. Then they stood me up against the wall and kept beatin' me, and beatin' me. I just couldn't take it no more, so... I shook my head. Detective Black beat him. Patrolman Stabile beat him. Detective Jacarrino lied to him. If you wanna believe all of that, that as a result of that Detectives of the finest police force in the world, they just go out and they beat up anybody just to get confessions out. Well then this society is in a very sad state indeed. But that's what you've gotta believe, to believe Lewis Humes' story. Either Lewis Humes... Either Lewis Humes has lied or.... or these police officers have lied. Very nice likeness, Lewis. Detective Black, 19 citations for bravery. Detective Jacarrino, Detective Corrigan, they have all conspired to pick out Lewis Humes of all people in the whole world. So either Lewis Humis is lying, or they are all conspirators. Ladies and gentlemen, isn't it true that we have nailed Lewis Humes on the button? How say you to the first count of the indictment, accusing the defendant of attempted rape in the first degree? Guilty. How say is to the second count of the indictment, changing the defendant of assault in the second degree? Guilty or not guilty? Guilty. - Will the defendant stand? The defendant, having been found guilty by the jury, is now directed by this court to be committed to King's County Hospital for mental examination, to determine whether he is a perpetual sex menace. Sentence will be determined upon completion of examination I'm not gonna give up ma! They made up their minds to kill me. We'll get help for you. We'll get help. Like some coffee? Alright. What are you doing in court this morning? - Just looking. You looking to take on Lewis Humes as a client? I can think of pleasanter ways to commit professional suicide. Always looking for glory, eh Jake? Aren't we all? I'll make you another Clarence Darrell . I am, another Clarence Darrell. - Oh yeah, sure. Read this. FBI report. A laboratory test failed to prove any connection between the button and Lewis Humes' coat. Does Portello know about this? Port has been on his desk always. We would've made that charge to the jury. Interesting, but not surprising. The Charges against Humes are phony. Which ones? - All of them. - What about the confessions? They were kicked out of him. They found with him a picture of murdered girl? The picture of the girl was not Jo-Ann Marcus. It was not Jo-Ann Marcus? - No. Well, if he confessed to three murders and attempted rape, what is he guilty of? - Nothing. Two coffees. Are you sure? - I know where he was at the time of the murders. Where? -150 miles away. How do you know? - I've got eyewitnesses, reputable people. - Who? People in a small hotel in Seaview who with Humes watching M.L. King's speech on TV. Practically every black knows where they were on that day. Thank you. Why are you doing this? I don't have to tell you what happens to a cop that leaks information. I know. Well? - I don't wanna do that. I was expecting someone else to do it. But no one is. On February 18th, another seemingly unrelated incident happened, this time in Spanish Harlem. I know he's coming. I'm not gonna run away from him. Roberto! You stupid hound! You ripped me off, man. What the hell you doing here? - The stuff you sold me was no good. Get outta here, you rat! Yeah I killed Timoteo, but it was in self-defense. He came at me first. We got ya this time, haven't we, Bobbby? You're not a three time loser. You're four time loser. It's the electric chair this time. - Not necessarily. What do you mean? - You know that Nelson-Marcus case? - Yeah. Well I know who wasted them chicks. What do you want from us? I wanna walk away from the Timoteo murder. C'mon! We already have someone on those murders. Don't you read the newspapers? You have someone. But you wouldn't be seeing me unless you have your doubts. Right? Alright let's hear it. It was the day of the thing came to my apartment. What was the man's name? - I want my deal, man. I'll have to talk to my superior first. Take him away. I guess the life of a Puerto Rican drug pusher doesn't count as much as two middleclass career girls. Because Bobby Martin, he got his deal. Sit down. - Thanks, don't mind if I do. Okay, full immunity on the homicide of Roberto Timoteo. No accessory after the fact to the Nelson-Marcus murders? You really know the law, don't you? - I could teach you guys a couple of thing. Okay Who is it? Okay. No accessory after the fact in the Marcus-Nelson. Now who is it? Guy by the name of Teddy Hopper. - Who? Teddy Hopper. Teddy Hopper? You know him? - Yeah, I know this guy's lying. He took you in too, huh? - Get outta here, go. We'll talk to you later. - Hey man, easy on the laundry. What makes you so sure he's lying? I know Teddy. He's not capable of thing like this. - What's he like? Cat burglar. - Cat burglar. That means he could have made the jump. I know him. In fact I was the first one who busted him. No, no. Butchering women is not his bag. Hey Theo! How are you, Teddy? - Alright, you? - Pretty good. I'm getting too old for this stuff. Hey I heard about you catching those guys who were heisting the Cabbies. How'd you hear about that? - Newspaper. Read about you all the time. No, he's over here in the kitchen. Hey you remember Joey don't you? Come here, Joey. Say hello to the nice gentleman. Hi. - Hi Joey. Teddy, I've gotta speak to you alone. You don't mind, do you Joey? -No. Thanks. - Come on let's go back in the other room. What? See? - Very good. What have your been doing with yourself Teddy? I've been working as a late operator. Really keeps me busy, too. Know what they call me down there? Busy cockroach. I've got something to ask you, Teddy. Where were you last August? Last August? Why? - Where were you? Beginning or the end? - August 28th. August 28th last year. Oh yeah, that was my vacation week, man. Monday I went to Orchard Beach to get some sun, but the weather was really lousy. Tuesday I went to visit the old lady. She asked me to help her clean up an apartment building where she works as a super. Did other people see you there? - Sure. Hey man, what is it? What do you want? - I can't tell you now, Teddy. Get your coat to downtown. - Joey, would you please do what I tell you, just once? Oh Josie. - Teddy, what is it? You remember Lieutenant Kojak? Hello. What's the matter? Nothing, nothing. Everything's gonna be fine. I'll be right back. Alright? Get your coat Teddy. Hey, Bobby, what's happening? I told them, Teddy. You told them? Told them what, man? - About the girls. About the girls? What girls? Marcus-Nelson. Marcus-Nelson? - It's no use, man. I told them the whole thing. Marcus-Nelson? - How you came to my apartment, the blood on your clothes, everything you said. Man, are you kidding me? You putting us all on? Marcus-Nelson? Don't be taken in by that baby face and that curly blonde hair. He axed 'em. He carved them up. Hey man, you must be in bad trouble. Alright, wait outside. Can't believe you, man. Sit down. You talked to the DAs. Now you gotta talk to me. See, you're a murderer, a pimp, a pusher. You put your old lady out of habit. A red light over her head. You showed Teddy how to use the needle. And then you turned him in to save your own sweet hide. You know all the details of the murders. Which means that if it wasn't Teddy, it was you. So now you can tell me again. He came to your place, right? You saw blood on his t-shirt? - Yes. Blood on his trousers? - Yes. Above the knees, below the knees? - Above the knees. He had a brown shopping bag? - Yes, sir. What? - Yes sir. You're so polite. You make me sick. What was in the shopping bag? - Two white handkerchiefs. Why handkerchiefs? - He took them to wipe the blood off his clothes. What else was in the shopping bag? Pink rubber gloves. Pink rubber gloves. - Yes sir. Yeah, he always uses them so there wouldn't be no fingerprints. How'd he get into the building? - Through the basement. How'd he get out? - The same way. How did he get into the apartment? Through the window. - Stand up! The service window? - Yes. That's one hell of a jump! Teddy makes those kinds of jumps. Anything else he tell you you remember? Yeah, he said the smell of blood almost made him throw up. Josie. I'm gonna be alright. Oh Teddy. You took too many this time. Too many. Hey Theo, how you doin'? - Hi Teddy. They thought you weren't gonna make it for a while That's only life, man. You've been in prison so often, I thought you'd wanna do a little more with it. Grandma Kojak, what are you doing here? You come to hassle me too, Theo? No. You were supposed to take a lie detector test tomorrow. Your overdose had nothing to do with that, did it? Hey man, I'm not gonna take any lie detector test. I mean, do you remember what happened to Lewis Humes? The same exact thing could happen to me. Except it could be worse. I've been in and out of jail since I was 17. You outta know, you were the first one that busted me. I don't trust them. The only cop in the world I trust is you. You did it, didn't you, Teddy? Are you kidding? No I didn't, man. Hey, where's Josie? She was exhausted. She was here for three days to make sure you're alright. Then I persuaded her go home. Will you tell her to come back? Quite a girl, isn't she? Yeah You don't know how she's taken care of me. Without her I would have been corpse a long time ago. Alright, I'll call her. This isn't gonna get in the papers, is it? My mother's sick and I wouldn't want her to know. - Nobody knows but me. Hey Theo? I didn't do it. I swear to you on my mother's life, I didn't. Hey Teddy! Hey man, I had to make a deal. I had to save myself, you understand? Hey man, I wouldn't have gone through with it, man! I would have made them look like fools if we'd gone to court. Hey Teddy, you don't really believe that I'd turn in a brother, do you? I had to make a deal, you understand? Hey man, what's going on in there? - Something about a bomb in there. Teddy, they just said they took a bomb out of the building. Yeah, that's why they took all the tenants out. - What are you doing? I think the bomb's right here in this apartment or at least a nice, fat bug. Nice, fat juicy bug? What are you talking about... - Shhh! Old friend Theo really wants to find out about me, doesn't he? Oh wow, Teddy. In one of the most unprecedented procedures in courtroom history, Jake Weinhaus asked for a mistrial in the Alvarez case, due to the prejudice and misconduct of the jurors in the case against Lewis Humes. In effect, he brought the jurors to trial. Mister Sacks, you were a juror in the case in the attempted rape case against Lewis Humes, were you not? - Yes sir. Did you hear a remark, made by another juror during the trial? - Yes. This is the remark: "These kinds are all the same. They've got to have it. These fellas like their sex. Did you hear other comments from another juror? - Yes sir. One of them said: "It doesn't make any difference, because if we don't get him here they'll get him in Manhattan". Thank you Mr Sacks, that'll be all. I now call Mario Portello to the stand please. Mario Portello, please. Mr Portello, you have been a prosecutor for the Brooklyn district attorney's office for how long? 12 years. And during those twelve years you have prosecuted how many cases? How do I know how many? Hundreds, maybe. You believe in fairplay, don't you? - Of course I do. and I believe in justice too... You were the prosecutor in the case People v Humes, were you not? I didn't hear the question, your Honor. - Would you repeat it, please? You were the prosecutor in the case People v Humes? I was. - Did you receive an FBI lab report which was an analysis of the coat and button in the case? - Yes. And did the report state that the button you submitted and the button on the coat, did not match in size, design, or construction? Correct. - Then how could claim that you'd "nailed Lewis Humes on the button?". There was other evidence. - What other evidence? Testimony of Mrs. Alvarez, the findings of our own laboratory. But you received contraty opinion from the Federal Bureau of Investigations. That finding was not conclusive. - The FBI said the button didn't match the coat! Correct. - And you don't think you did anything wrong holding this evidence from the jury and in saying you had, "nailed Lewis Humes on the button?" It is not my position to show every piece of evidence to the jury. The administration of justice must not be above reproach. But it must also be beyond the shadow of reproach. That the D.A.s silence was not the result of guile or prejudice matters litte. Its impact was the same, preventing as it did a trial that could in any real sense be termed fair. The court concludes the conviction cannot stand. The hearing revealed that prejudice and racial bias entered that jury room. I hereby vacate and set aside the verdict in the Alvarez case. And I grant a new trial. Jake, since when have you had this flare for publicity? - It's not about that. I certainly don't believe the finest men in our office framed Lewis Humes. No pictures please. Jake, in all my years... I said no pictures, didn't I? In all my years as attorney, I've never seen such a detailed confession. I mean, Lewis Humes must be some kind of genius, to remember so many details. How can he be not guilty? - Maybe he was coached? - By whom? Me? Detective Matt Black, with 19 citations for bravery? Detective Jacarrino, detictive Corrigan? Two of the finest cops on the force? Mario, no campaign speech. - What you mean campaign speech? I'm about law and order that's what this case is about! Law and order for a man who is poor and black. Hi Teddy. Hello mom. They're coming to talk to me. They're coming here to talk to you? - It's alright. I wanna talk to them. I wanna clear you. - Mom. Don't let this beat you. That's why you take drugs, isn't it? I know, I know. Because life is too much for you, because you can't face it. I'm sorry, Ted. How are you feeling? - I'm alright. We'll come back when you're feeling better. - It's alright. I want you to question me. Mrs. Hopper, you work as a superintendant at 334 East 83rd Street? I wash the stairs and clean the halls. Do you know where your son was the day of the Marcus-Nelson murders? Yes. - Where was he? He was at home. How do you remember so clearly? - He helped me clean the halls. When did he start? I woke him at about 8:30 a.m. I had to wake him. He's a lazy bones, he likes to sleep late. How long did he stay? - Until late in the afternoon. You're sure? - Yes. Mrs Hopper, Teddy is your son. Would you lie to save him? No. I wouldn't. Hey man I heard about your mother. Sorry man. Hey it's tight man, I need a fix. I can't get it nowhere. You wanna come to me? - Yeah. Come on. Hey man, How come you can get it when nobody else can? Microphone! They want me to trap you. So they got me wired for sound. They're giving me immunity to trap you. Man, we don't even get arrested walkin' down the street smokin' a joint. The cops is gonna support our habits. It's junkie heaven, man. You gonna have all the bombitos and the coke you ever dreamed. The new trial on the Alvarez attempted rape began. The courtroom was packed. It always was for a trial where Jake Weinhaus was brought in. Does he look like a blackskinned negro to you? Will the court direct the witness to answer the question? Mrs Alvarez, would you please answer? No. - Does he look like 165 pounds? No. - Does he look like 25 years old to you? Haven't I gone through enough?! Hasn't Lewis Humes gone through enough? He did it! He knows it, I know it, and God knows it! No more outbursts, please. You yourself said he was a stocky, 165 pound, blackskinned negro of 25. These are the descriptions that you gave to patrolman Stabile of the man. Sit down, please. By the way, do you have any interest other than as a witness in this case? Your Honor, I object to this line... There's no relevancy in this question. Your Honor, I will make the relevance plain in just a moment. - Proceed. You have nothing to gain whether the defendant is convicted? Or do you? Of course not! - Now do you know an attorney by the name of Nick Delias? Yes. - And do you know another lawyer by the name of Tom Floherty? Yes. - Did you speak to them? Yes, but... - In this discussion did not the name of Lewis Humes come up? Yeah. - And was there any mention of a $10,000 reward offered for the conviction of anyone in the Marcus-Nelson murders? But I... - No more questions. Judy, come on out of that bathroom, you've been in there all morning. Brother Mack wants to get in there. - I just got in here! Don't give me no lip. You've been making a home in that bathroom. You've kept up the suspense long enough. What is it? It's an article about Teddy, here. Let me see that. Come on Jenny, come on! Dig that: "There's a new prime suspect in the Marcus-Nelson case. Let's call him "Eddy" for the purpose of the story. A long-faced young dope addict. That lives with a woman twice his age. Pale in the face? Let me see your face, Ted. Don't look so pale from this side. Could be a little paler from this side though. They've got a picture of Lewis Humes. They're making him look better. Edna, he's a college kid. A nice, innocent kid. Can you believe it baby? -Before they tried to make him look ferocious. Now they're trying to make him look sweeter. - Nice and angelic. Say, can we go to the store? You have to go outside to go to the store. - First get a warm jacket. Mayl go to the store, is correct. - May I go to the store? "Please" usually accompanies a question like that. Please, may I go to the store? Yes, you may. Trudy,get some rubbers - Oh mom. You just go and put on those boots. You know the cops are coming to talk to you again tomorrow? Right! - Someone's gonna have to watch the kids. Well I know who that someone is gonna be. Only I ain't gonna pay him nothin'. Listen, Teddy. Teddy. I gotta get you to rap a little bit. Come on, like the window. You remember the time we talked about the open window? Remember how you said you got into the window? Hey, tell him he got in through the service entrance door. Teddy, I didn't tell anybody you took her glasses off. You had to get 'em off her, cause she wasn't wearing 'em when they found her. Listen. Teddy, I've got some really good stuff. Come snort this. We're going. - Didn't your mama tell you to put on those boots? Oh mama. - Oh no. Oh mama. - You heard what your mama said. -Alright. Hey come here, little man, let me button your coat. Hold still for a minute... Ow! Why did you pinch my nose? Don't you know I don't let my nose be pinched by no nose pincher? I'm gonna pinch your nose. Give me five. - Come on. And no more nose pinching, you. The cops are after us to take that lie detector test, Teddy. You hear me, Ted? I don't think I should take no lie detector test. Do you Teddy? We don't have to take no test if we don't want to, do we? Hey, hey, dig it man. You two take the test? And beat it. - How we gonna do that, Teddy? You can, man. Here's how you can do it, too: When they ask you, "Did Teddy kill those girls?", you just think to yourself that a very nervous, upset person did it, Which really isn't me. Just get it in your mind that it's was very nervous, upset person did it. - I dig. I mean, but it isn't me, man. It was a crazy man that killed those girls. So why didn't you take that test, Teddy? I could plant it in my mind that you made this up, that that didn't happen. I would take the test. If I could just put that day out of my mind, man. Lewis, do you see anyone in this courtroom who may have struck you? - Yes. You do? Who might that be? Detective Black. Detective Black, huh? Detective Black, would you stand please? This the man that hit you, Lewis? - Yes. You can sit down. By the way, did you have breakfast in the precinct that day? - Yes. How long did the beating take place? - I don't know. Where were you struck? - All over. Exactly where were you struck? My stomach, my back, and my shoulders. What were you beaten with, you remember? - Fists. Fists? Is that right? - Yeah. Closed fists, like that? - Yes. How many punches would you say you recieved? 10, 100, 50? 50. - 50. Were they hard punches, Lewis? - Yes. Very hard punches, Lewis? - Yes. 50 hard punches with closed fists. When did you say you had breakfast? Before or after? Before or after? - Before or after the beating? After. - After. So they beat you with the fist 50 times with closed fist, very hard punches, and then you sat down and had breakfast. No further questions, your Honor. You may step down Lewis Humes. May I have detective Corrigan on the stand please? Detective Corrigan, please. Do you swear to tell nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. Detective, you have elicited many confessions, haven't you? Yes. And when you question a suspect, you don't tell him that he did something, you ask him, did he do it. Is that correct? Yes, sir. And you speak to him in a tone like you use here? Is that correct? Yes sir. - Polite, calm, quiet. Correct? That's right. Where did Lewis Humes tell you that he found... ...this picture? - Objection, your Honor. The picture has to do with the Marus-Nelson case, not this one. Prosecution suggests the outcome of that case doesn't affect this case? We are not trying that case right here. We're trying to decide the credibility of the detective Corrigan and other detectives who questioned Lewis Humes. Objection, your Honor. - Denied. So, where did Lewis Humes tell you that he found this picture? He said he found it in a dump in Seaview. But you didn't believe him when he told you this. Is that correct? That's right, sir. - Were you looking at his stomach when he said that? Did you notice his stomach when he said he found it in New Jersey? I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. Did you notice his stomach was jumping in and out and up and down? I don't know. - But you didn't believe him. Is that correct? - Yes sir. Lewis Humes is a young, black boy, correct? That's right. And didn't you tell Mr. Goodman and Mr. Kojak that you could always tell when a black man was lying, by looking at his stomach because it "jumped up and down" when he lied? I don't remember. - You don't remember saying that? That's right. - You don't remember saying it or you didn't say it, which? I don't remember saying. - But you may have said? I might have. Didn't you tell Lewis Humes you talked to the two girls on the telephone? And that they weren't mad at him? I might have. - Did you? I don't remember. - Did you?! I said, I might have. You might have? - Yes. And if you didn't, that was a lie, wasn't it? - Well, that depends on h... You tricked and misled Lewis Humes, didn't you? - Objection, your Honor. Will you stop this harrasment of the witness? - That'll be enough.- I'm sorry. Law and order is being used in this country to mean: "stop the nigger." Officer here doesn't think he did anything wrong. People wonder why there is violence. Where there is no justice there, is violence. - Objection, your Honor. No more questions! Well you scored a few points. - I scored nothing. You think the jury's gonna take the word of a vagrant kid, black against cops with citations for bravery, particularly when they think he sliced up two white girls in Manhattan? Well it's time they know everything about the Marcus-Nelson case. I think we've got one too many murderers on this baby. Teddy? This is it. Over there. Today you're gonna tell us the truth. Look. And this. Oh wow. Show him. Alright, sit down. And this. Tell him! I brought you here to tell you I've been working with them. All along. My Lawyer's name is Jerry Block. His number is 614 74 02. - It's all over baby. Forget the lawyer. Tomorrow, the jury comes in with a verdict on Humes. Today, you tell us the truth. - He needs some stuff, man. We got it all, Teddy. Remember when you talked to your friends about beating the lie detector test? Remember how you said for them to think it wasn't you that did the killing? We got that too. We even got your dreams. We heard what you said when you dream. You don't know but we do. You asked God to take you. That's what you said. Give me a spoon. - First things first. Not until we get a full confession! Theo, we're on tape, you can't promise him anything if he confesses. They'll throw it right out of court. Get in the next room, both of you. Do you realize how many people you're destroying? A five year old boy, Josie, your mother. - Come on give me a fix man. I was in the hospital when they questioned your mother. Come on hit me. - Wasn't in condition to talk but she wanted to give you an alibi. Now she's trying to explain away your actions. You gotta give us something. We realize, what pressure you've been under, waiting all these months for the axe to fall. - I need a fix, huh? I'm a catholic, just like you. Last night, I went to church and said a prayer for you. I prayed that you make your peace with God. - I don't wanna make peace with God. You don't know that. - Damn right I do. Don't give me that! I'm a dead man. - Hey, what do you mean? If you're dead give us something. Give us something to help you with. It's me you wanna help, huh? Couldn't be you want glory? Give me a fix! By tonight your face will be known all around town. Your son will see it. Josie will see it. Your mother in the hospital will see it. You know what they'll say? That you're some creep who oughta be locked away! For the safety of some girl in an apartment. I'm sick, man! - You want me to have compassion for you? What you have compassion for? What about Lewis Humes? He's gonna die and you don't give a damn! - I'm sick! You carved up those girls. And now you're gonna tell me or I'll kill you. You're doing exactly what you said the guys in Brooklyn did. I have a note here from the jury. We are hopelessely deadlocked. What does this mean? - It means we have to go to trial again. I'm sorry, Mrs Humes. - Again? Hey, hey, stay awake. How's he? - We gave him a sedative. Did he say anything? - We grilled him all night but he'll never crack in a million years. Leave me alone with him. Hey Teddy, how are ya? As well as can be expected, I guess. - You want coffee or something to eat? All right, some coffee. - What do you got? Ham and cheese and cornbeef. - Give me a cornbeef. We've known each other for a long time, huh? I like you. I've seen a lot of guys trying to make it. I never wanted anybody to make it more than you. You screwed up, kid. Hey, who won the game last night? - The Yankees. Pepperton get any hits? - Three or four. I wanted to pull a lousy burglary and wound up killing two girls. What happened, Teddy? I saw the open window and I came in. You went into the apartment? She was lying there? She pulled the sheet up around her. What happened then? I decided to have her. Yeah? I took out a knife. Then what happened? - She said "Don't hurt me". What'd you do then? The dark haired girl, what's her name... Kathy came and stood in the door and said "What's going on in here?" I see what's going on in here." She turned and started to run towards the door. I was gonna leave the apartment but something told me I had to kill them. I got two soda bottles and struck both girls over the head. And then what did you do? I just kept stabbing them. I just kept stabbing them. I hit a rib in Kathy's back. Did you know Jo-Ann before you went in that day? No. - You had gloves on the whole time? Yeah. Where'd you buy the gloves? Five and Ten on 89th. How much did you pay for them? - I don't know, man. 29, 30 cents...whatever. - Where were the bodies when you left the apartment? Hey I don't even want to think about it, I just want to erase it out of my mind. He wants to erase it out of his mind. I told you, if you played it straight with me, I'd help you. Now let's see your mother and Josie. What do you want me to tell them? Just, just tell 'em to forgive me, man. Teddy Hopper was indicted and held for trial in the Marcus-Nelson murders. Lewis Humes was freed. The charges in the Marcus-Nelson and the Ethel Lawson murders, dropped. The first time he'd been out of jail in two years. It's gonne be good to see the sky again. No he's not here. - There he is now. - Hold on... Lewis Humes wants to invite you to a party. Hold on. It's your friend, Lewis. Hello kid. - How ya doin'? We're having a party here and I was wondering if you could come over? I'm a little busy. I wanted you to come over, cause without you, I wouldn't even be walkin' around. I've been invited to the party. Is Lewis here? - Who is that? Lt. Kojak, come on in and make yourself at home! This is Lt. Kojak. I already told y'all about him. Mr Kojak, this is my girl, Loraine. - Hi. - How are you? Come and meet mama. Charles, turn off that TV. - I wanna see Lewis on the news. This is mama. This is my oldest son, Abe. - Nice to meet you. And over here's grandpop. - Hello. And this here is Sunny. I think it's time for the cake. Lt., Lewis did those drawings there. And he did these here, too. I hope it's not insulting. - No, no. At least you gave me a lot of hair. I made this cake, so y'all better enjoy it. Mom, it ain't my birthday. - It ain't your hat, neither. You looking foolish man. Don't tell me I look foolish again. A piece for everybody. And an extra big piece for you, Lt. - There he is, there's Lewis. Are you going to say anything to us? - It'll be good to see the sky again. Maybe I should go to jail. - Don't say that even as a joke. In Brooklyn however, District Attorney Mario Portello had this to say: We in Brooklyn have no intention of letting Lewis Humes go free. You still believe that Lewis Humes is guilty of the Marcus-Nelson murders? We still say that he knew details only the murderer could know. You and I are interested in having a clean, decent place to live, right?. It is dreadful to think in this country, here in Brooklyn, a woman can be taken, grabbed right off the street, assaulted, and an attempt made to rape her. We are going to proceed with the rape charges against Lewis Humes. Why don't you let the kid go, Mario? Hasn't he been trough enough? Make sure I get the superintendent's corrections in opening before he goes to lunch. I'm sorry I can't let him go, Theo. We got an eyewitness identification, and we can't let a rapist on the streets. He's no rapist. And you know it. Theo, I really feel sorry for you. I know you went out on a limb. Hey! - Nail Lewis Humes by the button. And all the time the FBI report in your desk. An hysterical woman looking at him through a peephole? The description, missing on all important points. Even if he was guilty, his crime is saying some dirty words to a woman? You think the boy is innocent, I think he's guilty. You can't admit to yourself that he's innocent, why? Because to admit you'd have to admit how corrupt you really are. You and I no longer have anything to say to each other. The right man on the right job. You know I've never been naïve about human beings, but it's a surprise that people let this kid go down the drain. And you want to know what overwhelms me? They don't see anything wrong in it. So what's gonna happen now? They're gonna try to prove you're guilty of something. Makes 'em look too bad if you aren't. Hi. - Hello, just in time. The judge has just gone in. - I still can't get used to wearing my glasses in rain. Hi, Lewis, how are you? - Hello. How the hell can you say hello to him? I guess he's just trying to get ahead. What do you say, Jake? They brought out the same old witnesses again. He tried to rape me. He knows it, I know it, and God knows it. Black talked about his 19 citations. Jacarrino reluctantly and distastefully put in a knife again, but nobody cared anymore. There was no packed courtroom. And I felt that nobody really believed that Lewis Humes was guilty. He had to be found guilty, to protect reputation. It was like we were all sleepwalkers, watching a terrible pageant that nobody cared about anymore. Lewis Humes was found guilty of attempted rape. Sentence: five to ten years. But... I didn't do nothing. I understood for the first time what Jake Winehaus meant: When there is no justice, there is violence. I remember the first time I walked the beat , I felt we were doing the most wonderful job in the world. I thought of us as "Watchers of the city", protecting what was best in it. Some people say the community gets the police force it deserves. I say the police force is the community. That was the end of the Humes case. Except for the fact that it changed my life, and yours. Lewis Humes case was cited in the Miranda decision of the Supreme Court, which demands that his constitutional rights be read to a man under arrest. Matt Black, still working as a police detective. Mario Portello was elected an assemblyman. Lewis Humes, still in jail today, for an offense that normally a man with no record would be given a suspended sentence. As for me, there's a dream I keep having. I walk into MacNeil's office. I throw my badge on his desk, and then I tell him where he can stick it. The truth is, I still go on. 23rd Precinct. Right away. I still go out arresting people like Teddy, who committed a crime because he was terrified of going back to prison. And Lewis Humes, who never had a chance from the beginning.
