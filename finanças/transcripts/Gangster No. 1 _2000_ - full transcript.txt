Here you are, grandad. Go get yourself a nice bird. What do you take me for? A cunt? (MAN) This is 1968. I'm playing Jack The Lad at snooker When all of a sudden Fat Charlie's come in. Not that he was fat. He was skinny. He was called fat 'cause his mum Was fat. It's how he Was distinguished from the other Charlie, Skinny Charlie. He was fat, but it was too late to swap it around. Anyway, he says to me... Go and see Freddie Mays. Fucking hell. My heart was going mad. Freddie Mays. Freddie Mays, "the Butcher of Mayfair". The man was a legend. He'd done a copper in Bethnal Green and got away with it, for fuck's sake. That's how you get to the top - kill a bent cop. After that, Freddie Was king. What a place! A fucking palace. In he came. There he Was, in those handmade, Italian leather shoes, silk socks. The suit? Do me a favour. The man was class. A class act. Style. Im-fucking-peccable. What a man! I mean, a real man. - All right, how are you doing? - Yeah, good. Do you want a drink? Yeah. 'Cause you look a bit scared, son. Are you scared? No. Scared? I didn't need a drink. I was drunk enough on the smell of Italian leather. Arseholed on the smell of success. I hear you've been hanging around with Mad John. - Yeah. - And this incident last week. Apparently you handled yourself quite well. - Yeah. - (SNIGGERING) - Trevor heard that as well, didn't you? - Yeah. - He thinks you're a bit of a laugh. - (MAN #1) Does he?

No going out on your own. And no independent fucking thinking. Argh, fuck! Ah, Freddie... Ah. - Because it irks me. - I can't fucking see. (TREVOR) I... I can't... Yeah. That's a word - "irks". Argh. Fuck. Anyway... it appears we have a vacancy. You're in, son. Straight off he gives me 500. 500 in me hands. I mean, this is 1968. And do me a favour. Take out the rubbish, eh? (GROANS) Oh, and get yourself kitted out. There we Were, suited up. Wasted on these fucking toerags. Come here, you cunts! Come here! No! No! No! No! - Give me till next Thursday, please! - Thursday never fucking comes! "Give me till next Thursday"? Slags. It's pathetic. Fucking excuses. All sorts. From A to Z. The Whole alphabet. Jokers.

Nothing I can't fix with a few tools, eh? - Don't do anything stupid, Freddie. - Why would I speak to you, arsehole? Remember the last time we went through this?

'Cause somebody must dead. - It's a war! He don't deal with them. - Pull over. We've got a puncture. Pull over, Roland. Puncture. So where's this puncture? It's not your side? Felt like it was your side. Well, me no see nothing. Hey, what you do? I was stroking your frizzy hair. Oh, fucking things! Charlie, let me do that. You take the tea in. Come on. Wrong knife.

He's just a bit old-fashioned. Don't think I wanna be here, anyway. You wanna watch your mouth. Right, what were we saying? - It's gotta be him. - Let's take a look. All we know is a black body's been found. One of ours is missing. It's Roland. He's been missing for five days, Freddie. Don't mean it's him. What we're getting to is this. If it is him, it's them. - It's two and two. It adds up. - Fucking right! What the fuck are we waiting for, eh? Let's go now. Hit them now! We gotta get uglier, Freddie. Take the initiative. I'll show those bastards torsos. I'll cut their fucking arms off! He never deserved it. Poor bastard. Come on, Freddie. Say fucking something. Let's just go. Let's hit 'em now! Hold on! Hold on, John! Think about it. Why Roland? Eh? I mean, why not you? Or Tommy? Me? All of us in one go. Bang. Beautiful. Perfect. Fucking happy. Now that would be a takeover. That'd be nice. That I can see. But this... don't make sense. Something does not make sense. Maybe it was meant for me. Or for you! Shut it! What if it ain't him? What if it's someone else? - Who the fuck else could it be?! - Someone else! - I think we should... - Sit down! All right. Right. This is what we do. We wait. All right? You all got that? We wait. We give it a couple of days. And if he don't turn up, all right. So be it. All hell breaks loose. (KNOCK AT DOOR) All right? All right, Freddie? What's going on, then? Fr... He gone deaf or something? He doesn't wanna be disturbed. - By anybody. - I don't think that means me, does it? That's what he said. Cup of tea? Bomb, was it? No, we're redecorating. Oh, are we? Well, that's nice, isn't it? You let a bird into your life, next thing the walls are all poof-pink. There's potpourri all over the bog and knickers in your cornflakes. Who's he in there with, or is that a secret? No. He's in with Tommy. And Roland's sister. Listen, Karen. I think we might have got off on the wrong foot. - If it's my fault, I'm sorry. - Well, we can always start again. You know, you're not bad-looking. "Not bad-looking"? "Not bad-looking"? I'm a prince, darling. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. Why don't you find yourself a nice girl? I could help. Do me a favour! I've got so many birds, they're coming out of me ears. I can't even hear myself think. So what's behind this, then? Freddie's not allowed to see it yet. What do you think, then? It's not a bad likeness of Freddie. - Nose a bit on the large side, eh? - Very funny. Freddie's mad about horses. I thought it might make a nice engagement present. You what? An engagement present. As in me and Freddie getting married. Didn't he tell you? He fucking didn't. Are you up the duff? Can we hear the patter of tiny feet? - No, not yet. - (MIMICS) "No, not yet." Bet you're over the moon, ain't you? Hap-hap-happy. That's a nasty way of putting it. I've never been happier. I'd have thought any mate of Freddie's would be happy for him too. What's your problem? Ain't me that's got a problem, darling, is it? I'm not surprised he didn't tell you. Not exactly over the moon, are you? There's something really ugly eating away inside of you. I see it in your eyes. I could see it a mile off. Well, I love Freddie. I'd kill for him. I don't give a fuck whether you approve or not. - Keep your knickers on. - I'll look after him, whatever it takes. - Do you understand me? - Keep your fucking knickers on. (WHISPERS) Do you understand? Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. I wish the best for you. - Really hope you're happy together. - Yeah? Yeah, really. Congratulations. Tell Freddie I'll catch up with him later. Tell him, you know, I'm happy for him. For the both of you. And er... Karen... Take good care of him, eh? Well, what was he gonna do? Crack open the bubbly, smiling from ear to ear? "I'm getting engaged!" "Cor blimey, you ain't! Fuck me! "Nice one! Congrats! "You kept that under your hat. You romantic old so-and-so." And I'm thinking, love makes you fat.

Freddie and Karen were jumped outside the Candelabra. You what? They cut Karen's throat. Fuck me. And what about Freddie? Right, it's like this. He's not dead, but he's in a bad way. He's been cut to ribbons. 300 and something stitches. Shot three times. He's on the lot. Morphine, you name it. They're gonna try and operate again in the morning. It's... touch and go. But he's strong. No. (SIRENS WAILING) Look, you fucker, I wanna see Freddie. I wanna see my mate. Not possible. They won't let you see him. There's a... - a situation. - What fucking situation? - A serious fucking situation, Tommy. - Fuck off! Listen. Listen to me closely, Tommy. Lennie Taylor has been killed. - What? - Tonight. Hacked to death at home. Do you understand what that means? Christmas has come early for my colleagues up there. They're charging Freddie with murder. It's perfect. They've been after him for a long time. It's a win double. - (TOMMY) Freddie didn't kill Lennie. - But what it comes down to... is Freddie's finished. - Now piss off. - Oh, yeah? I wanna see Freddie. - Tommy, for fuck... - You are some cunt. - It's just money to you! - All right, Tommy. There an admission price for this fucking freak show? - Leave it. Tommy, calm down. - Is that it? - Is that fucking it?! - Fuck off. Fuck off. Tommy? You all right, mate? Oh, Jesus. All right, son? Put that in your hand, eh? All right, mate? Poor fella. Jesus. Come on. - Silence in court! - (MAN) You show 'em, Freddie! Old Judge Mumbling said, in all his however many fucking years, the murder of Leonard BertramTaylor... We laughed. "Silence in court!" ...was the most barbaric case he'd ever had the misfortune to try. Judge told Freddie he was an animal and gave him 30 years, to serve a minimum of 25. Howzat! Take him down. (MAN #1) No! (MAN #2) Fucking arsehole! - (MAN #3) You cannot do that! - British justice, eh? Poor old Freddie. The king is dead. (JOHN) I told you. I fucking told you. Someone should listen to me for a fucking change. - None of this would have happened. - John, you was right. So what? - It's no good to us now. - Fucking right I was right! Come on, Tommy. Maxie? What's his fucking fate? That's what we're here for. - Rather than all this old fanny. - Don't be stupid. - Don't you call me stupid. - All right. Right. We can't go near 'em. Anything happens to Maxie, we're fucked. There's no way. There's no way on this fucking earth is that cunt, that fucking cunt, gonna do what he done to Freddie and get away with it. - There's no way he's gonna avoid me. - John... - No fucking way. - It's a difficult time. I'm trying to deal with it as best I know. This ain't helping. - He's dead. He's fucking dead. - All right, all right. Just... just calm down. Everyone, just fucking calm down. Act like men.

Nothing can touch us. We're moving. Raking it in. Way out of Freddie's league. Sort of thing he'd never have dreamed of. I'm gonna fucking knock you out! 1st of January 1973. Grand opening. The Casino. Black tie. Freddie always said gambling was for mugs. It is. Took two million the first year. Never understood that thing Freddie had for the horses till I bought one. Brown Bomber. Earned me a packet. Then disaster - it won! '76, Tommy's wife dies. So he retires. Lost his bottle since Freddie got banged up. Tommy, stop. '77, '78, '79, '80, '81. I've got 300 people working for me. Top that, Mr Mays. '82 to '86, cocaine. Fucking fortunes. You fucking wanker. Don't you fucking knock? Look at this gear, eh? '87, '88, Billy offends me. The one good thing I learnt from Freddie, keep your own house in order. '93, Maggie's children suffer the consequences of the '80s. Don't We all? Do We, fuck! Business is as good as ever. Poor little merchant bankers. Still got enough for a little toot, though. (THRASHING) '94, not such a good year. Mad John murders his wife in a domestic. Nothing I could do about it. As it happens, in the supermarket. Fucking sad Way to go down. Taken out of the fucking place like a poxy junkie shoplifter. Last of Freddie's boys. End of an era. '95, '96, '97, '98, '99... '99. Freddie Mays is back. Lock up your daughters. Chinatown. Well, Freddie, all those years. How's it been, son? Tough? Was it tough? Tough on you? Hard to bear? Still, for my part, I'd just like to say, Freddie... congratulations. You're out, fit and Well, and I'm happy. Oh, fuck off. Look at me now, Freddie. You want a job? Me and you, Freddie. Just like the old days. I can't live like that. Can't do it. Hello, Eddie. Hello. It's been a while, eh, Eddie? We really should catch up. Be nice catching up. Let's catch up. Old mum well? Good. Great. Magic. What the fuck is going on with Freddie Mays? When'd he get out? Wednesday. - Do you mind if I get back to work? - No, no. Let's go somewhere more private. I don't like it. Nobody told me he was getting out. - You don't know about the wedding? - Wedding? What fucking wedding? Freddie's wedding. Everyone'll be there. He's well, too, from what I hear. He's got a BA. Bachelor of Arts. Who's he marrying, anyway? - Somebody he met in the nick? - Karen. You remember? Singer. Lovely face. Throat cut. Nearly died. Eddie. You ever kill somebody, Eddie? - How do you mean? - Well, you know, like kill 'em. What, like, dead? Yeah. Dead. - I'd have to say no. - Why not? Well, I don't want to. I think you could. If it was somebody you really hated. If he'd done something, like, to me and my family? Yeah. Now, look, I wanna ask you a question. No ifs or buts. I want a straight answer. Who, if you had to choose, would you sooner kill? Me or Freddie Mays? - Truth? - Yeah. Truth. You. Sorry. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah, yeah. Fire away. Why haven't you killed me? Who says I'm not going to? (MAN #1) Come on. (MAN #2) Come on. (MAN #3) Take it... Oh! (MAN #4) Come on.

Karen! Imagine bumping into you after all this time. - It must be what? 25, 30 years? - You know exactly how long it's been. Well, I thought maybe you were dead. Oh! Healed up nice. I know why you're here. Stay away. Freddie don't want to see you. He don't wanna hear from you. He don't wanna smell your cheap aftershave. Me and Freddie have waited too long for some evil ponce to fuck things up. That's not very ladylike, is it? You're a fucking freak. You stay away. I told you I'd kill for Freddie. Oh, yeah. You told me a lot of things. "You're not a bad-looking bloke. "Why don't you find yourself a nice girl?" What makes you think that you're so special? You know, I wouldn't mind a wife. Someone to love. I deserve some love. I want a Valentine's card. I don't care if she is a slag. I'll look after her all right. Spoil her. Buy her stuff. Maybe I'd like to settle down. Nobody ever thinks about that. I mean, nobody ever thinks about me! Well, fuck you! You tell Freddie I wanna see him or there'll be consequences. Serious fucking consequences! Get out of my fucking way, you cunt. So, Freddie. Heard you was getting hitched. Getting yourself a ball and chain. No, no, I didn't get no invitation. No, not to worry. I couldn't have gone anyway. Business. Still, hope it all goes well. And for my part, Freddie, I'd just like to say congratulations. You're out. Fit and well. And well, er... Here's to you. I like what you've done with the place. Sit down, Freddie. Been a long time. Yeah. Like a cup of tea? Yeah, that'd be nice. (CLATTERING) Fuck. So, Freddie... How are you doing? All right. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Look, what do you want? I hear you're getting married. At some point, yeah. A little something. Go on, take it. Go on, take it. It's for you. Take it. Freddie, I want you to take it. Take the money. I took your money. You take my money. It's for you. Don't take it. What do you want? Oh, the flat? Is that it? You wanna move in? You and Karen, yeah? Cosy Karen? Well, take it. I'm out of here! Redecorate. Why not, huh? New carpet. Lick of paint. Lovely. Patter of tiny feet. Yeah, well, you're probably past it. Can't get it up. And she's no spring chicken. Probably come out all twisted and mental. Baby Freddie. Spastic. Or she's barren. Probably all dried up. But you could always adopt. What do you want? The shoes, is it? The handmade fucking shoes? Here. They're yours. Have 'em. Here, take 'em! They're yours. The tie-pin? Oh, you like the tie-pin? Oh, fuck me. It's even got your initials on it. Take it! Have it! Here, it's yours! You're mad. No, it's you. You drive me fucking nuts, you do. I don't want your flat, your shoes or your fucking tie-pin. That Freddie's dead. What... what is it with you? I mean... Where are you coming from? Explain it to me, because I'd like to know. Really, I wanna know. What have you got that I haven't got? I done better than you. I'm the better man. Wasn't me who spent fuck knows how long inside. Fucking professor. What? You think I wouldn't kill you? Do you think that, do you? Just 'cause it's you. Is that what you think, is it? Well, I can kill somebody. It's easy. It's easy to kill somebody. It's nothing. I avenged you. (SCREAMS) I didn't wanna kill Lennie Taylor. I did not wanna kill Lennie Taylor. I didn't enjoy it. Had to be done. Somebody had to do it. Yeah. Karen spent the past 30 years telling me the whole thing stank of you. That bitch. Take it. Take it. Pick it up. There it is. Pick it up. Shoot me. Shoot me! Shoot me, you cunt! Who do you think you are? Pathetic. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I was. I was vain. I was a prat. "Handsome Freddie Mays. Butcher of Mayfair." What a load of old cobblers. Who'd wanna be Freddie Mays? - Fuck off. - You're a nutter. I ain't going away so you may as well kill me. Come on! Kill me! Come on! For old times' sake. Down memory lane. (GUNSHOT) I was there. (MOCKS) "Get your hands off her. "Karen! "Maxie, please, no. Not the girl! Not the girl! No!" Sound familiar? Huh? You crawling around in your own blood. Pathetic. Hilarious. Maxie's got his knife out. No! Come on, Freddie. Come on. Maxie with his blade digging at her flesh. Ripping that lovely throat. - Karen! - No! And you going, "Shoot me, shoot me", like a sick cow. - (GUNSHOT) - Come on, Freddie. Come on. Come on, Freddie, two more yards. What... What's that she's saying? - I... love you. Love you. - (CRYING) What's that? (MOCKING) "I love you, Freddie. "I love you. I love you." What? Does she still love you? With your pruney bollocks and your old bird's hair? Handsome Freddie Mays.

I'll give you a fucking war, one arm tied behind me back. I'll shoot you. Blow you to kingdom come. They'll need a dustpan and brush to scrape you off the walls. Make mincemeat out of you. Pie and mash. Puddles of blood. I'll leave you lying there, the rotten lot of you. Calling me a cunt. Calling me a cunt. Calling me a cunt. You cunt! I'll fucking kick you. I'll kick fuck out of you.
