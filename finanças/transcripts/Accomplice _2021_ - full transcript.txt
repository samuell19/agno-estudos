First memory… it's a tough one. There's a lot of 'em. Whoo, good going, Curtis. Cameron, how old are you? Four. How old are you gonna be in 10 days? Five. Hurry. - Yes. - Okay, go. - Go left. Oh, my God… - Yes, yes. What is it? Whoa, yes, yes. What do you think? Good job, buddy. Go, Ethan. Here comes Tyler. Ah, I messed up. Keep going, Curtis. Oh, good dismount. Yes, Curtis, keep pedaling. Good Hannah, atta girl. Yeah. Oh, man, my first memory was… The first thing that comes to mind is that first one… I was probably five, six-years-old… My dad picked it up at the flea market. James got it at that little supermarket. It was like tippy toes, just trying to get my feet on the pedals. I remember the handle bars were above my head. I was seven-years-old and that changed my life. It opened almost every door there is for me. Hello. I really suck at these. You don't have to send out a disclaimer, just bust. He wasn't lying. -What? -Nothing. There you go. Nice. Oh, that's Cedric Gracia. You're getting a lot of tricks on this thing. Here you go, I'll hand the camera down to you. Yeah. Here you go. - Is it filming right now? -Yeah. Hi. Oh, hold up I'm gonna change angles. I'm filming. Oh, no. - What! Dude, you hit it perfect. Wow, nice work, guinea pig, that looked terrifying. Look at that, dude, right there, holy cow. I'm gonna start lining this up. It's like guinea pig ping pong. Yeah that's the right speed, I think. I think I felt that one. When you're ready, I'll just count you down. Right he's dropping, three, two, one. Yeah. Trainsies on this sucker. Yeah, we're ready for that. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors two out of three or… -Yeah, loser goes first. -Winner leads, huh? Or winner follows. What does the loser have to do? -Lead or follow? -I guess it's lead. Lead. Loser should lead, that's what I thought. That's right, yeah. -Okay, cool. -One, two, shoot. - No! -Let's go. Tyler's the loser. -Four, three, two, one, let's fly. -You got it? Yeah! Come on, dude, wow, look at that. Well, that was really fun. Crazy, oh, man, that was rad. -Target acquired! This sound cold to you? Okay, ready? Drop it in, three, two, one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, baby! Nice. Yeah, that's so cool. That was super cool. Whip, oh, butter. That was sick. Oh, that was a good pause. Yeah! Wait, hold on, stay there, don't move. -With a broken foot. -Yeah. Look at him walk. Peg Leg. Peg Leg. Okay, see ya. Oh, yeah. I think the exploration is such a huge part of mountain biking. That's kind of like the roots of mountain biking, riding on terrain that you wouldn't normally interact with. So, we've just turned up in Ladakh, India, which is on the border of Tibet, China, Pakistan, super mountainous. Dope! I see trips like this as a massive opportunity to sort of like build on myself. To see the locals so at ease in seemingly harsh environment was inspiring. The whole environment's pretty just overwhelming, it's the best word to describe it. That's a massive, cool. Everything looks sick. Riding somewhere brand new to both of us, then also somewhere that no one's really ever ridden lines before. That should be sweet to ride over. It was super great to have her there. So, we could chat, bounce ideas. What do you reckon to that? I like it because it looks like you'd have more space. More room to curve around and stuff. - Yeah. -Yeah, for sure. It's more like a team sport, really. You just put the bottom bracket on your shoulders. Let's try. I still feel very tired. Pick it up and like, put the tires in. -Should we send it? - Yeah. We were at like 10,000 feet which is 3,300 meters roughly. Jesus. Ah, I regret this decision. Obviously, like, I'm used to being around mountains or hills basically in the UK, but nothing on this scale. It makes you feel really small. All right, 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Drop it in. Whoo! Whoo! Get it! -Yo, that was sick. -Nice. Okay. Sick, oh, it's so cool. It's very much a collaborative process. Hang on. I think we both ended up riding things, that we might not have otherwise. Well, I feel like on this trip anyway, I've come away like, knowing what I want to work on within myself. And part of that is based off of the locals I've seen, like how they interact with each other. Yeah, there you go. Definitely an experience of a lifetime, something I will take with me for a long time. No. It's been an amazing learning curve, and it's been sick to share with people who are super hyped as well. I love it when everyone pushes each other and then pushes themselves around others. Come on, boy, come on. Bentley, good girl. Come on, Bentley. Good girl. Yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about this trip. We're here with a group of friends. We got Buehler, Aggy, Sorge, Nico, and myself. We've all been friends for so long. It's a reunion for us. This is like, you know, the proper BC experience, coming out here and being in this mountain range. Ten days riding every day coming back to rad camp. It's like, just what you dream of. There's a certain silence to it, that you can't really describe until you experience it. Yeah, camp life, it's… it's cold. Yeah, I find it pretty cold. I'm used to some warmer weather. Welcome to the camp. This is where we live, me and Nico. We're sharing this tent that we borrow from mister Agassiz. It's a little bit messy in here now. We got Aggy, who's probably got the secret set up here. So he's pretty warm at night, now good on him because it's actually freezing here. Really important tools here. The generals they save a lot of hiking time and a lot of energy. And show you guys, the most luxurious part of the camp, I would say. We've got Sorge sleeping down there. I think he went for the most dangerous spot around, that's where the bear is gonna come from, I think. Here we got Aggy, he's a natural barman. Hello, sir. Looks like these guys are getting their sauna ready. Come in. Yeah, boy. Sorge, dude, beach day or what? All the guys on this trip, they're all like buddies to me. Camping here with them, like, it's pretty epic. Slap the bass, buddy. Come on, girl. Can't wait to not shower for ten days. I don't know, biking, it's always better, when you're sharing it with someone else. And this was a zone that needed to be shared. Yeah. Yeah, that's sick, hey. Oh, dude, this looks insane. Kinda gnarly though. Pretty sporty. This is a long one, man. You're a super badass or you're an idiot, you know. I think you badass. Yeah, Kurt. Yeah boys, atta boy. Roll. Sorta nice, dropping in. That was it. Go. Go. Yeah, Sorge, that's nice, dude. Yeah, Sorge, nice! Yeah, boys. That's very nice, yeah, Garett. Oh, yeah, dude! That's a sick line. Yo, he's good. Yeah, Garett. Wow, that was so intense. I was so scared. Yeah, boys, see you guys at the bottom. Yeah! Yeah, Nico. Yeah! Woo! Yeah, Buehler. The lazy purist. Oh, yeah, dude. Yeah, Sorge. Yeah, Kurt, here comes Aggy. Oh! No way, dude. Kinda nervous. Use your brain and your brakes, all right, buddy. Yeah, Andreu to Aggy, it's good to go, dude. It's so fun! Hell yeah, brother. See you in a second. Yeah, Aggy, my man. Whoo! Yeah, buddy. Come on, Aggy. Yeah, here you are. Oh, buddy. Yeah, Aggy. Go! Dude, Aggy's deep, yeah, buddy! You were ripping, dude! Oh, I couldn't go any slower! Oh, yeah! See you at the bottom, guys. Yeah, Nico. Where's Nico going? -Damn, that looks nice. - Yeah, Nico. Yeah, boys! You were so fast. That was sick. Yeah, my dudes. Hell yeah, boys. Here's comes the party line. Crazy to think that 10, 15 years ago, I was just a little grom and this was just all a dream. Yeah, Buehler. And now it's become a reality and I'm riding with my heroes, and get to call them my best friends. Yeah, boys. Good day in the mountains. You guys got bear spray? I've watched Cam Zink videos growing up, watching Ride Rampage before I was even in and just thinking he was the man and he still is. Just seeing mental battles and stuff he overcomes helps me. He's definitely an inspiration in my riding. Yeah, it's so cool to be able to walk around out here and seeing him like, "Oh, yeah, wish you could ride that," you're like, "No way." I think you're gonna want to pop it a hair so I'd go a little bit slower at the top. He's a legend. He's had a lot of experience and it helps us a lot. He's just a gnarly dude. And he'll never stop. Going. -Get it, Zink. -Yeah, Cam! Riding with Jaxson, Tom and Ethan, it's just incredible to watch. There is a future for sure. Here to lead the way. Whoa! Hell yeah! Yeah, Jaxson, get it. Give her hell, bud. Oh, my God. Wow. -Roll it. -Get it, Zink. That was so sick. - You're up. - Yeah, chief. Yo! -Whoo! -That was so sick. Yeah, I don't know if I would have done that, if Zink wasn't here pushing his limits as hard as he is. It's definitely super inspiring. Oh, yeah! Yeah, the bike has brought me the best opportunities in life. It has given me the best memories of my life, right, like winning those events, traveling around the world. Come on, who wouldn't want that lifestyle? It was amazing. Next racer, Paul Basagoitia, trying to get that height. Paul Basagoitia. It's crazy. I barely even got in those events. No one knew who I was. And now I win one of the biggest mountain bike comps. I think no matter what sport Paul would have done, he would have had the grit to be a champion. Ladies and gentlemen, Paul. And then I'm in a weird situation 'cause the bike also caused one of the worst situations in my life. At one point I hated the bike. Next rider at the top of the course, this is Paul Basagoitia. A guy who has won so many events in his storied career, going long on the step down, can he hold on? Oh, no. It wasn't the biggest crash ever taken in my career. I thought it was totally fine. When I hit the ground I was so pissed and I was like "Damn, I gotta go up and do it again." I was ready to do my second run. Like, I didn't hurt. I was totally fine. Until I tried to move and then that's when I knew I was in big trouble. I couldn't move my legs. Looking back at it, I remember when I was getting like, this is crazy, when I was getting cut open in ICU during surgery, at a ten and a half hour surgery, I remember having a flashback of 15 years of the bike. I remember like the first couple crank works, I remember traveling to Europe. I remember all those first tricks that I was doing. So, stoked, I mean last year, I came out here, no sponsors, nothing and then I won. And then this year, I can't believe I repeated it. I remember waking up from ICU… ten hours later, wake up the next day still no movement. Six months, still no movement, you know, wheelchair for a year. Holy shit. What just happened in my life? How you feeling today? A little better man, every day is getting a little bit better. I was in a dark space, I hated the bike. I sold all my bikes. I never wanted to even look at the bike again. For me, it was like, what's the word, um, insecurity of me, and my situation. Wobbling around with a cane, like, people looking at me different, like, "Must suck to be Paul now." You know? When you're at the top of the game, everybody's there. Everybody wants a piece of you right? But when you're at the very bottom, that's when people should be there for you the most and that's where Cam was. Even in the early stages, he would come and visit me in the hospital. Weeks after my injury he would still come to hospital, see how I'm doing. I go home. He's like, "Hey do you need anything?" He'd always be there asking like, "Hey if you ever want to go and try to ride that bike again, "I'll be the first one to help you out." When everything is taken away from you, you appreciate those little pedal strokes. I don't feel normal. When I wake up in the morning, I look for my cane, I look for my bracing. But when I start riding the bike, it's the only time in life that I feel normal. I don't get why a lot of people are hating on the E-bikes. If it wasn't for the E- bike, I would be locked inside my house. Not being able to ride with my friends, not given me the freedom to do so. What helped with me, I can only speak for myself, is time, and then realizing that no matter how bad your situation is, there's always someone out there that has it worse than you, that is dying to be in your position. Now live by that. It's very humbling what the bike has given me. The freedom, the escape from everything and everyone. It's given me a community. Some of my best friends are actually, I met them through bike riding. Sorge, nice. It's an outlet for being creative and expressing myself. It's like this weird time machine where we're older and there's a lot more stuff going on in our lives. It's fun. But it's still same feeling as it was back then. It's a pretty cool relationship with the machine. Let's do this, ready? Oh, my gosh, I think you're on it. I think you're on it, go, go, go, go! Yeah! No way! Yeah, Shy! And I think it was off camera when I remember telling Towana. Towana went like, "Dude, after this documentary, man, you're never gonna see me." And here we are shooting the mountain bike segment. We made these stickers #IrideforPaul after his accident. And then we put a little amendment with the X over it that said, "I ride with Paul." Yeah, enjoy those moments with your friends. This lifestyle, this competitive side of things does not last forever. So, if you walk in and help those other people, and maybe another day winning is not everything. It's about enjoying those moments with your best friends. What do you think, bud? All right, in the fish tank, in the creek. -Looks really sick though. 2005 taking over the world! Can we go together? Heck yeah! Come on, Kelly, follow the trail with me. See you later.
