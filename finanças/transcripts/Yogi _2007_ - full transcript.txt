I don't need these injections. - Give me pills. - Okay. Brother, a call from Narsing Pahilwan. What, Narsing? Are you alright? Tell me. Is Goddesu very proud of himself? He lived like a dog next to me. Even now, he fears me. I will talk to him. It's okay, send me some money for my treatment. Bye. - Hey! - Brother? Call Goddesu. Brother, come on. Greetings, brother. This is what the game of fate is. You used to live like a king on the cot. But now you are living in this stinking house. Forget it, brother. Come to my house. I will give you scotch instead of this saline. And you were like a calf, but you grew up to be a bison. Brother, didn't he grow muscular? Why haven't you grown? What happened, brother? Looks like you are angry. I heard that you are interfering in Narsing's area. I made it very clear that neither of you will interfere in the other's business. Don't you respect me? Shut up. Is this city your father's land to decide about the areas? Even a donkey can become a goon, with God's blessings. Even a donkey can become a goon if God favors him. Rowdyism is like a sword. It will be held by someone powerful and pierce through a weak man's heart. Now, the entire city is in my control. If I lose my temper, I will kill you as well. I could say all this. But I won't. You are my teacher who taught me this business. I still respect you. Warn Narsing, not to step into my area. I think you have forgotten your past. If I had forgotten, you would've been dead by now. What are you staring at? Do you think I came here because I fear you? I came here because I respected you. One should safeguard his respect and his life. If you lose either, you will never get it back. Let's go, Krishna. Old man, I will send you money every month. Peacefully eat and devote your time to God. Hey! I will slit your throat. Hey! Hey! When? Were you a goon in the past? How dare you threaten to slit my brother's throat? Oh, God! He is physically handicapped but mentally very powerful. He will sacrifice his life for me. If someone shouts at me, he will kill them. What are you seeing? His game is over. Take him to the burial ground. Krishna, come and wash your hands. Operation successful, the patient is dead. Look for another patient. KANCHERLA Sister Shantamma! Sister Shantamma! At last, you got a letter with the address of your son, Sister Shantamma. Sister Shantamma? Shantamma went to the city for her son. For her son? How will she search for her son in Hyderabad without any address? Oh, my God! Why did I land in this city? God! Where is my son living in this big city? - Brother. - Yes? - Did you see my son anywhere? - Who is your son? You are asking who? He is six feet tall, very fair, and looks very handsome, brother. - Do you have his address? - No, brother. He wrote many letters but never gave his address even in one letter. In this city, even finding someone with an address is difficult, how will it be possible if you don't have one? He is my only child. I had him after a long time of being married. He is God's gift brother. He came to this city without informing me. I must take him back to my village. Please help me find him, brother. It's impossible. Dear Goddess, please show me where my son is. Bloody idiot! Brother! Damn! Idiot. Who are you? He rarely gets in the mood, but you stopped him. Wait, sister. Brother Narsing Pahilwan is dead. What? Is he Dead? He promised to give me a flat in Punjagutta. Damn! You hold on. How did he die? He was killed by just one man. He died on the spot with one stab. Parking Paramesh. Tell me. - What are you saying? - Yes, brother. I must meet him once. After all, he killed Narsing. Where is he? He is in police custody. They will take him to jail tomorrow. Srisailam, Dilshuknagar Das, Warangal Yadav, Uppal Srinu. Move. Hey! Why are you pushing me? Do you think this is the line to get groceries? This is a jail. Do you know who I am? Siva. Akula Siva. I am not an ordinary goon. Many people die when I yell. If you... Killi Seenu. Come on, move. Brother, Akula Shiva. I heard you got transferred from Vizag. When did you come? Forget about me. We can't find you even with an arrest warrant against you. But why are you coming to jail on your own? - To see Yogi. - What? Yes, brother. If he has killed Narsing, we need to see him. There is no one in the city. Every one of them is here. Brother, when will he arrive? Sir, all city goons are in jail now, We have to open B-Barracks, shall I do that? What? Why did they come to see him? He killed Narsing with one stab. We wanted to see Yogi. When will he arrive, sir? He will come, Parking. Even I am eager to see him. Brother, forget about him. As soon as he enters the jail, we'll kill him. He will die today. That's it. Forget it, brother. Why do you worry? We'll handle it, right? I am taking a huge risk. If you miss him, I'll become worse. Hey! Go away, man. I will not miss my chance. Leave! Idiot fellow! Just because I took a bribe from you, I became so cheap to you. Let's go. If Superintendent comes to know about this, there will be a big problem. Media will play its part. People are used to the media's antics. If we do our duty sincerely, these stars might change but our fate will not change. Don't stress me out. Get me some tea. Panjagutta crossing. Over Okay, alright. Over! Yogi will be here soon, sir. Lock all the prisoners in barracks. No one should stay outside. Fast. Staff attention! Security personnel, lock all the prisoners inside the barracks. You are too good. You look like a lion, brother. Brother, I am Siva, Akula Siva. I will always be with you. We will rule Twin Cities after you come out. Brother, I am Killi Seenu. I am like your brother. Remember me, brother. Brother, the entire city is in my control. Keep me with you. Open the door, sir. Fire trucks should leave after the fire is extinguished, and cops should leave once the violence is over. Now, go. It's not like that, sir. The power is out. We need to guard the prison. What do you mean by guarding? All the prisoners are locked up. So, move. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, don't hit me, guys. Sir, I did this because they promised me some land to construct a house. - Sir, please excuse me. - Using cell phones and taking bribes. Only people like you can do this in a prison. Sir, I am also an officer. The court will take action against you. Really? Give him the prisoners clothes and make him a prison inmate as well. - Yes, sir. - Let's see what happens. Bring Yogi. What, man? All the goons in the city have come to see you. None of your relatives have come. Don't you have anyone? Come on, guys. Sorry. - Sorry, ma'am. - It's okay. - I didn't see you. - It's okay. Here, both people and vehicles are very much alike. Oh, my God! Hey, girl! Journalism must be very innovative. If my wife beats me, it is very usual. If I beat my wife, that's news. Sir! I've shot a sensational incident. Take a look, sir. Narsing Pahilwan's brother is burning down all the shops. Watch it. Burn down everything, guys. Hyderabad City must burn for my brother's death. Very interesting. Burn down everything. Hey! Brother, she went inside Vivekananda College. Shops might have burned but, you got a good subject for your practicals. - Thank you, sir. - Hello? Saidulu. - I'm Saidulu speaking. - I've heard your name before. I am very popular. People call me a goon. A girl has come to you with a camera. If that news gets printed, your college and house will burn. Don't worry. I will handle everything. Okay? Sir, will I get good grades in the practicals? Sir, will I become a reporter? Look, dear. News must be sensational. But not on the phone. - What do you mean? - I mean the TV. We see this every day on TV. Is there anything new in this? Try another one. You coward! Your wife will burn your French beard with gasoline. - Who you are abusing? The principal? - No. - Why would I abuse the principal? - Don't lie. You abused him. Abuse him, abuse him more. Do you know how to or should I write and give it to you? - Idiot! Stupid! Scoundrel! - What about you? Did you drink before coming to college? I never come to college drunk. I drink after coming to college. Hey, girl! Stop! I called after you this morning but you left in a hurry. The watchman won't let me in. My son's photo is with you. What? I have your son's photo. Yes, dear. Check, it must be with your books. Oh, sorry. When I bumped into you this morning, I must've picked it up with my books. Oh no! Were you waiting for me in this rain? - Is this the one? - Yes, it's my dear. Cover me. He is my son. Where do you have to go? What will this rain tell you if you ask its destiny? My situation is the same, dear. I don't know why but this city is very confusing. I've come here in search of my son, dear. - Don't you know where your son stays? - I don't know, dear. I am still searching. Without a proper address, it is very difficult to search, ma'am. I will drop you at the bus stop. First, go to your village. Enough. - I will never go back until I see my son. - Ma'am, stop. Where will you search for him without any address? People use to say I can never have children. Wasn't he born? Now similarly everyone is saying that I won't find him. But I will. Okay, you can start searching for him once the rain stops. Till then, come with me. Auto! Where did he come from? Rayalaseema. Our village is Bethamcherla near Kurnool. What's your son's name? Prasad. Eeshwar Prasad. Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! Oh, Lord!

Lord Shiva, protect and shower your blessings on our village. Prasad! Hey, Prasad! You are coming after my dance is over? Come. I will teach you a lesson. - Eeshwar Prasad, stop. - I won't stop. When everyone came to see my dance, you came after it was over. Keep calling my name. - Get lost! - My dear, stop it. Hey! I can run after you but I can't climb trees. Get down, dear. Get down. Neither do you have to climb up, nor do I have to come down. - Go away, Mom. Go. - It's not like that, dear. I went to buy your father's medicines. He must be waiting for me. - Come, let's go. - Oh no! Really? Then, you go home. Don't I know how to make you climb down? What? Are you going to dance? Do you think I will come down if you dance? Hey! I know you from the day I carried you in my womb. You can't cheat me. Even I know you since birth. Your husband must be waiting for you. Go. Prasad. Come, my boy. Won't you come down? Come on dance, Mom. - I can't, son. - Okay. Watch I will dance. Mother, let's go home. Father must be waiting for us. Has your anger eased? Why would I get angry with you, Mom? I am crazy about you. You are my God. You are my Lord Shiva. Excuse me, where is Kolattam Ram Moorti's house? Go straight then turn left, the third house is Ram's house. - What, man? How are you? - It's been a very long time. You can leave today. Come tomorrow. Okay, sir. Welcome. How is your health? No improvement. When your health isn't fine, why do all this? - I need to run the family. - Your son is an adult, right? We still have to feed him. - He is still a child to his mother. - Child? He was dancing so well at Lord Shiva's temple. Was he dancing? Yes, I saw it while coming here. He is better than you at dancing. Why take up this? Everyone in this village knows who Kolattam Ram Moorti is. But it's useless. What's left are these photos and cups. So we don't need a dancer, I advised him to join a company and do a normal job. I told him so many times but he just won't listen. Let him come. I will talk to him. Hey, son, don't run. Stop, dear. What, Mom? We must somehow try to convince your father. - Let me think. - Okay, think. Hey, you were a great actor those days, right? Why do remember that? There are much better actors in this house. Come, I will show you. Look there. Didn't you get a good idea? If he gets to know that you danced in the temple festival instead of finding a job, your dad will kill you. Hey, tell him that you bought these medicines. I understood. Go on. I will come after you. You are my dearest son, right? You will understand you are so brilliant. What is that? They both came here together and now is she coming alone? This is nothing. The real drama will unfold now. Prasad. Hey, Prasad! Keep watching. Hello, brother. When did you come? - How are you? - Yes. Did you see our son? Why? Wasn't he with you? With me? I saw him last night. I haven't seen him since this morning. Why are you still standing? Sit down. I must tell you the truth. He obeys and respects everything his father says. Did you finish talking? - Now your pampered son must come. - Father! - He is here. - Yes, he's here. - Father. - Stop. Stop there. Where were you since morning? Tell me the truth. Or else I will break your legs. Idiot. I went to the hospital. Did you go to the hospital? For what, dear? I went there early this morning to buy medicines for my father. But the doctor was not available. I waited for some time. And he came just a while ago. Here are the medicines, Mom. My good son! You have done a great job. You give it to your father. Okay, Mother. Oh, my God! Take it, Father. Shantamma! You went to buy medicines in the hospital but forgot to take your prescription. The doctor told me to give it to you. Okay, go. What is this? Your father's health is not good, right? Why don't you find a job and help him? What brought you here, brother? Like this, you're making him useless. As if everyone's son in this village is useful. Shut up. Oh no! - Father. - What happened? - Slowly. Help him lie down. - Dad, come. Hold him. Slowly. Careful. You will shout at us unnecessarily and then cough like this. - I will kill you. - Mother, go inside. - Yes, you will. - Go inside, Mom. - Brother... - Give those medicines. - You should leave as well. - He'll shout if I stay here. Father, drink this. Mother. - My son. - Yes, father. Hey. I'm not asking you to find a job to live on your earnings. Your mother is very innocent. A mother will only bear her child for nine months. But your mother has been bearing you for 22 long years. If something happens to me, you must look after her not like a son but like a father. Don't say that, Dad. You will be fine. I will take good care of you both. A mill is opening in our village next month. I will work there. Okay? Damn! After I left this Betamcherla Village, it is stinking a lot. Nasty fellows, can't be clean. - Oh, God! - Hey, run! Hey, Basha. Hey! Which idiot hit me? - Hey, Prasad! - Yes? What's happening since I entered the village? - It's okay, can you count this? - Eight. Eight? - By the way, what do you do in the city? - Four. - Business. - What business? Cutting business. What will God do when the pocket is full? All gone. Eat well, or it will fall. Her chain costs around 10,000 rupees but she is very careless. Let me put it in a safe. - Where do you do your business? - Wherever it is crowded. For my business, I need crowds. Only then it is easy for us. Oh no! My daughter's chain is missing. Oh no! I lost my purse. Oh no! My bag! I have them safe with me. You'll find your photos only in your home. But not our photo. You'll find it everywhere. With slate. BASHA - Basha, you are great. - Yes? When you stole your mother's gold chain, she felt bad. Later, she felt happy. Why did she feel bad and why did she feel happy? She felt bad for losing her gold chain. But she was happy for getting rid of you. Mother! If I knew this before, I wouldn't have bought this necklace at all. Do you earn so much money in Hyderabad? You can also come there if you want. Who will look after my parents if I come there? Hey, first earn money and it will look after everyone. You are my childhood friend. I'm telling you this because your mother is also my mother, you leave this village and come to Hyderabad. In Hyderabad, come near Lord Shiva Temple, and inquire about Basha's house. What will you say? - "Where is Basha's..." - They will guide you to my house. You will get a job and money. I will seek my mother's permission. If she allows me, I will come. An inauspicious sign on inviting you to Hyderabad! Only four people are carrying it. Who is the dead man? Ranga Reddy. He killed people when he was alive. Now that he is dead, no one is going to his funeral. - Prasad. Hey, Prasad! - What? The saint who lived near the temple died. You should go. - He is not a good man. I won't go. - Don't say that. We can skip marriages but we should go to funerals. People suffer a lot of loss and hard times when they are alive. But after they die, they are equal to God. When you see a dead man, pay your tributes. If possible, participate in his last procession with songs and music. I'll leave, brother. Brother, I will also join you. Brother, you have so much money, right? Put a garland or hire a band, so that we can sing and dance. Oh, God! Careful. Lie down. Careful. Hey, Prasad. Hold on for a while. Hold on for... Mother. Ranga Reddy is dead. No one came to his funeral. But I went. I saw a priest on my way home. He gave me water from the Ganges and told me to give it to my father. Father! Open your mouth. Father? Mother. Father. Father. Father. Why are you sitting here? People are forcing your mother to do the widow's rituals. Mother? Poor woman! She used to be like an elderly woman at every family function. Mother. Are you humans? - Do you treat someone like this? - This is a custom. What custom? Which God told you that? No. We don't need these customs. No, you shouldn't say that. I can't see you in tears, Mother. Can I see you bleed like this? Mother... Brother, take this money and give me those bangles. What? Those bangles with this money? They are made of gold. Whatever, I need them for my mother. - Hey, Prasad. - I will give you the rest later. Mother, show me your hands. - What are these? - Bangles. They won't break. Where did you get them? From me. - We will give him money later. - Shantamma, I made them for Rangiah's daughter-in-law. - But he took them away. - Hey! - I told you that I will pay you. - Shut up. - It's not like that, Mother. - Go inside. - Listen to me, Mom. - I said, go. Don't misunderstand him, Bhadra. He took them because of his love for me. He didn't mean to steal them. Take them. - Where are you taking the load? - To Hyderabad. Give me a bidi packet. Prasad! Uncle, did you see Prasad? No, I didn't see him, Shantamma. - Hey, Prasad! - Dad? Why are you sitting here? Find a job. Don't sit idle. Prasad! If you stay in this village, you have to sit idle. Come to the city. You can buy gold bangles for your mother. Prasad! Hey, Prasad! Hey, Prasad! Prasad! I wonder what problems my son is facing now. Bye, dear. Where will you go? It's not so easy to find a man in Hyderabad. It'll take at least a year. Even if you complain to the cops, they don't care much. I'll do something, I'll get you some coffee, please sit down. Do you stay alone in such a big house? I and my uncle live here. Where is he dear? He's the unluckiest person I know. He must be roaming around somewhere. Damn! Shit! What the hell! Why is it listing out all my misfortunes? What can it do? It says the truth. Nobody with such a bad horoscope can live on this earth. Bloody machine... why does it say about danger from water? You may face some danger from water. Is it Vizag that I should worry about water? Is there a sea here? Will a tsunami hit us? This is Hyderabad. Bloody danger from the water! Sir, money! Why would I try my luck if I had money? Ask your machine if I'll pay you or not. Come on, pick it up! A sexless machine with a few bulbs and cassettes. Come on, ask it! Sir, you can't pay it seems. It's not that I can't pay, I won't pay. Yes, sir. Because your purse has been stolen by someone. Really? Hole! I had 1000 rupees in my purse. Forget it, sir. You're the unluckiest person. Go. Do you really feel I'll have a problem with water? - I'm sure, sir. - Okay. He said 1000 rupees but he is short of 200 rupees, bloody liar. What problem would I face from water? Hyderabad Tsunami. Oh, God! Danger from water means taking baths and drinking water are also dangerous. Let me test it. It's good! No problem. Danger from you? No way, you'll have a problem with me. Why are you dancing in the puddle? It's a road and there's water, why are you calling it a dance? Is it your home? This is a road. - Road? - What? - Look down! - Water. - Look down, man! - I saw... I was wondering how can water be dangerous. I never expected it to be so tall and huge. That's not the issue, my time isn't good and I don't have any marriage proposals, I've been roaming for three years for marriage. Finally, when things started looking good, you spoiled it, bloody idiot. Yogi is coming out of prison. Goddesu is bailing him out. Let him come out. I'll stab him in the same place where he stabbed my brother. Stab him! Brother, stay away from him. He hits like a madman. Think about the condition of our men that fought with him in prison. - Hey! - Brother. My life will be meaningful only if I kill him. I'll kill him. Yogi! - Who is it? - Isn't Auntie home? She's inside. Who are you? We'll tell you but first get us something to eat. What's with your rowdyism? Take it. - Auntie! - Yes? - Who is she, Auntie? - Thanks. - I'm your auntie and she's my auntie. - Thanks, Auntie. She'll stay here, take care of her. Now you may... Okay, tell her to give our cut whether you're at home or not. Okay. Give me your son's photo, I must give it for printing. Yeah! I'll get it. Look, dear. Your uncle is sitting in soiled clothes without taking a bath. Look at him, dear. What's this, Uncle? Attacked by water. It was seven feet tall and weighed three tons. A gigantic wave hit me. Tsunami. Did anyone beat you? No, he thrashed me. He beat me up by pushing me into a small hole. Okay, go and clean up. No! No, no water. Your fate! Nandu? Give me some cologne, I can't bear this stink. - Damn! - Same feeling. I want to take some rest. Oh, God! Here you go, dear. My son's picture. He's handsome. - Yes. - Will you make me your daughter-in-law? - He won't suit you, dear. - Why? He's not educated. Education isn't important for marriage, Auntie. No idea where your son is now. Why did you bring us here? A hero is getting released from jail today. To see him. Move. Sir, I'm Nandini, I want your interview. - Is he an actor or a politician? - Sir. - Please go away. - Just once... - Please go away. - Sir, it's a small interview. - Don't talk to her, come on. - Sir. Come on. Move. Step back. I'll definitely interview you. Whose photo is this? That's Shantamma's son. Anyway, I must find him. That's the only clue I have to find him. How can you find him with such a small clue? Even the biggest locks are opened with the smallest keys. Okay, where should we go now? To Goddesu. Goddesu? Who is he? - Hey, Krishna! - Yes, brother. Have you arranged for the feast? - Everything is ready, boss. - Really? Then what about the dancing girl? She's here boss. - Brother. - What? Yogi is here. Welcome, Brother. Welcome. I've arranged a grand feast in your honor for getting out of prison. Hey! My spine hurts. Start the music. Hey, Yogi! Hey, Yogi Oh Yogi, bite me Oh Yogi, chew me Oh Yogi, shake me up Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Take my heart, take my life Take my heart, take my life Take my heart, take my life Oh Yogi, bite me Oh Yogi, chew me Oh Yogi, shake me up Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Oh lady, may I ask you Oh lady, may I caress you Oh lady, may I squeeze you Oh lady, may I drown myself in you Oh Yogi, bite me Oh Yogi, chew me Oh Yogi, shake me up Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Take my heart, shake your body Take my life Take my heart, shake your body Take my life Though I have a suitor And he's coming from Calcutta He's no match for your manliness There are many men in my place There are many macho men among them But no one can match your prowess You're praising me to the hilt I'll make your dreams come true Come closer to me, fulfill my desires Crush my body with your passion I'm your unmarried wife Sweeter than a wife Open the latch and put the patch Oh Yogi, bite me Oh Yogi, chew me Oh Yogi, shake me up Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Shake your body The day after tomorrow is inauspicious Tomorrow is a bad day Only today is fresh Now the time is good This moment is auspicious Why are you holding back? Give the almanacs a little rest Strengthen the cot Come closer to me, fulfill my desires Crush my body with your passion I'm your unmarried wife Sweeter than a wife Open the latch and put the patch -Oh Yogi, bite me -Shake your body -Oh Yogi, chew me -Shake your body -Oh Yogi, shake me up -Shake your body Oh Yogi, make me a part of you Brother, take it. No. Why did you bring me here? Brother, from the time I was awake till I close my eyes, I'm sick and tired of watching these cattle around me. So... I want to keep a lion with me. I've ten families legally and illegally. A house full of wives and a compound full of cattle, and a lot of henchmen. Maintaining them has become a big problem. Moreover, I'm physically handicapped. At this juncture, I found you. My tiger. Boy, be with me. - What should I do for you? - Real estate. If the land is occupied, we'll get it cleared, if the land is vacant, we'll occupy it. Simple. Brother, the girl wants to go. - What should I tell her? - One minute. - The dancer wants to leave. - Okay. - Would he like to have her? - Damn! He's young, he hasn't yet taken to bad habits. Enough, everyone is innocent when they start to work here. Once you start, you'll know everything. I don't want him to start on my account, do one thing... forget it, my back isn't cooperative. - Ask her to go. - Okay. What have you decided, son? I'll not work for anyone, I've only one job, I must take good care of my mother, I must go back home. Look, we've got you out on bail, you mustn't leave Hyderabad till the case is closed. Either I'll be with my mother or with my brother. I'll not stay here. Let's go, brother. Where are you going away? When the boss calls, you have to come. You can only leave when he wants. Or else stay here. Do you think you are a great warrior? - Step aside. - Why should I? Hey! Come, brother. Brother, he's dead! Dead from just a punch? - Greetings, brother. - Greetings, brother. Greetings, brother. What happened to you? What happened to them? They are calling me brother. Why won't they? You were a servant here till recently, but now you're a great hero to the entire city. What? "Craze." In politics, you earn fame as years pass, in films, you get famous after hit movies, but goons get fame as their terror spreads. Once branded as a goon, you're a hero. People may have never seen you, but use your name to make a living. - Brother, I'm Ganesh speaking. - Come on, make it quick. I sold off Shamshabad farm long back. What's there in Gachibowli? If you want, I have some in Shadnagar. - What's going on here? - Construction, brother. You sold this land to me, right? I sold the land to you, but I sold the flats to other customers. - Take this brochure. - Excuse me, I need to talk to you. Wait a minute, I'm talking to the landowner. Did you see that? He said I own the land. You own the land but the flats belong to other customers. - Excuse me. No, sir. - Why are you interfering here? I'm the real owner of this land. What's this? Would there be just one owner for a piece of land in Hyderabad? There will be at least a few people. Whoever is lucky will get it. - Is it a big deal? - Are you trying to cheat us? I'll hang you from Charminar. Okay, wait. I'll settle things in a second. Hello, it's me. Ganesh speaking. Give the phone to Brother Yogi. - Who is Yogi? - I'll tell you. Hello, Brother Yogi, it's me. Ganesh. It seems people here don't know. Just a minute. He's Yogi, who killed Narsing Pahilwan recently. Brother, on the land where we sold the flats, two owners are here. Others haven't come. They may not be aware of it. Brother, a man here is threatening to hang you from Charminar. Just a minute, brother. Brother wants to talk to you, talk to him. Wait near the Jubilee Hills bus stand, I'll be there in half an hour. Let's catch a bus to Karimnagar. We don't have any connections with this site. What a fate! Goons are helping the real estate business to flourish. Ganesh here. Mr. Anjibabu. It is a great site, east facing and with ample space in the northeast. Come immediately to book. Why do a film now? - Then suggest an alternative. - Hey, Soni! Your brother has hired goons to beat up your lover. How dare you love my brother's sister? Beat him, brother. How can he love her? Come on, let's stop him. Oh no! If my brother sees me in this dress, he'll kill me. Give me the bindi. Okay? - Beat him. - Hey! Why are you beating him? What are you asking? He loves his sister. That's why. She loves me as well. He's lying, bro. My sister hates to love. When I asked her to use a fairness cream to become fair, she refused to do so because she hates to love. - Is he telling the truth? - True. Didn't I tell you, bro? Not what my brother said, but what he said. What's this? Your sister is saying nonsense. Enough of it, get out of here. Hey! Do you know who I am? - I'm Killi Seenu. - Really? Do you know who I am? I'm Yogi's lover. Why did you come out in the sun? Won't your skin get tanned? Tell brother that I inquired about him in college. He's not your brother but your brother-in-law. For goons, it's always brother, not brother-in-law. For us, this sister is more important than his sister. Nandini, you saved Soni by lying to them at the right time. Why? What if it's true? What are you saying? He looks handsome. - Who? - Nandini. - I am Nandu's uncle. Where's Nandu? - She's on the second floor. Okay. A balcony isn't the right place, the toilet is the right place. Yeah. Bloody Principal doesn't allow me to drink openly. Hey, Suryam! Damn! It's gone to waste. What are you doing in the bathroom? What would anyone do in the bathroom other than pissing and shitting? Not just that, people use it to cry if their wife abuses or bashes them. - Mad fellow. - My wife never beats me. How can she if you're drunk always? Come and take the car out. I smell alcohol here. Have they used alcohol as a disinfectant? No! Oh, no. Oh, no. Why are you screaming in the hospital? Shouldn't I? Is it any library? It's all burnt. - What is? - Where's the doctor? He'll come, why are you in a hurry? Is he a fire truck to come late? Where is he? - Hi! - Hello, sir. - Hello. - He has it at the reception. - Hi, Julie. - He spanked my butt again, bloody idiot. Why do you always spank them? I go mad after seeing some butts. - Oh, God! - Come on. - Oh, God! - Buttocks! Oh, no. Why did you shriek now, boy? Why did you spank me so hard, dude? - Dude? - Doctor. What's your problem? Fire accident. - Did you burn it yourself or someone else? - Myself. - Little or fully burnt? - Fully burnt. Why did you burn your butt? - It was fate. - Why fate? Why are you asking silly questions? Start the treatment. Okay. Why are you handling me roughly? - Did you use kerosene or petrol? - I don't know. How can I treat without knowing the material? You're hurting me more than it. The case is critical, treatment is simple. Apply Burnol and bandage it. Can I go home after that? - No, you have to stay here for a month. - Why? - You've got to pay the bill! - For Burnol? Such a huge hospital we built! Don't spank it again, I'm ready to stay here for two months. Good boy! How is it? Unbearable pain. Fire is always effective. Now I got you. It's just the usual viral fever. Don't worry. You charge so much to say this! Wait, brother. Use these medicines, you'll get better. Why does your uncle always get into trouble? He just can't stay put, Auntie. Prasad! Please don't mind, son. - I mistook you for my son. - No problem. Auntie, please don't mistake any young man for your son. It'll be embarrassing. What can I do? A mother's love is mad. - Excuse me! - Yes? Where's the reception? Hundred rupees more, please. I think you're swindling us for medication! Wait, brother. Money is nothing compared to health. Prasad? No... maybe he's someone else. What, Auntie? Did you mistake someone else for your son? Yes, dear. Any young man looks like my son to me. Don't worry, you'll surely find him. I'm also on it. Okay? - Thank you. - Welcome. Let's go. Uncle. How are you now? How can I tell you? How could you sit on fire? I didn't sit on fire, but it caught fire after I sat on it. It was a big blow. SHIVAJI NAGAR Where are you, man? Take it. Take the pamphlet. Oh, Yogi! Hi! Remember me? Nandini, I met you outside the jail. Journalism student. Don't you remember me? No. What are you writing so seriously? To whom? "Mather, hou are you? I am pine hear. Eat properly." Don't you know how to read Telugu? Are you writing in Telugu? No? - Really? - Yes. Okay, take this pamphlet. My hands are not free. I'll keep it in your pocket. - Hey! - Hey? - What's this? - Pamphlet. Read it when your hands are free. Bye. SON, I'M IN HYDERABAD STAYING WITH A GIRL NANDINI, COME AND MEET ME, YOUR MOTHER - Letter is addressed to? - Bethamcherla. This is local, put it into that box. I'll not leave you without your interview. Let's go. Oh no! - I didn't notice. - Who are you? - Where do you come from? - Please don't mind. Are you blind? Bloody idiots. - I'll clean it. - You... Hey! Don't touch me! Get lost! Please, get lost! Please don't mind it. Where do such people come from? Hey! Who were you scolding? That guy. An idiot. Do you know who he is? Why would I care? - He's Yogi. - Yogi? Why is he going alone? Aren't we following him? - Go and apologize to him. - He already left. - Where are you coming from? - A small hamlet near Srikakulam. Not from Hyderabad. - I don't know anything. I'm not him. - Come here. Hello! Yogi! You again? Why are you alone? What if anyone attacks you? Aren't you doing that right now? Then you must counterattack me. Why are you after me? - Go away. - Oh! Why are you so angry? Am I asking you to marry me? Am I asking you to sleep with me? Am I asking you to give me children? - I'm asking for just an interview. - Hey! Are you really a girl? - Hey! - Are you really a boy? - Go away. - I said I won't! - Oh no! - Oh no! Look, you're beautiful and chubby. Why are you after me? You say I'm beautiful, why don't you date me? You... you're shameless. How far can you go after leaving me? You're young, smart, and handsome You've taken over my heart You're young, chic, and beautiful You've spoiled my sleep With your sweet kisses You're my goon You're my king You're my mischief You're my headache I'm crazy for you and I'm giving myself to you Don't pinch me with your rejection Don't let me go mad I'll pinch you I'll cure your madness You're six feet tall I can easily remember you Can any girl resist falling for you? I see you in everyone You smile beautifully Can any young man remain sane? It's your mistake and my mistake Let's commit sin together It starts with the girls, so tell me What sin shall we commit? Don't pinch me with your rejection Don't let me go mad I'll pinch you I'll cure your madness Oh, boy! Do you want my heart? Alright, girl! I'll take your heart Right now Oh, boy! Do you want my heart? Alright, girl! I'll take your heart Right now My eyes wink at you without my knowledge My hands caress your hips Without my knowledge My shadow follows you without my knowledge My sari end flies on you Without my knowledge My finger scratches the dimple On your cheek without my knowledge I gave myself to you in a dream Without my knowledge Don't pinch me with your rejection Don't let me go mad I'll pinch you I'll cure your madness You're my goon You're my king You're my mischief You're my headache I'm crazy for you and I'm giving Myself to you -Don't pinch me -You are the one. Baby! -Don't pinch me -You are the one. Baby! -Don't pinch me -You are the one. Baby! -Don't pinch me -You are the one. Baby! Who are they? - Why are they following me? - I hired them. Saidulu wants to kill you. People need you. I live for my mother, not for the people. Till now, people feared goons. But now, goons fear you. Turn their fear into a weapon and protect the poor. I don't need this violence and weapons. I'm going back to my village. My mother must be waiting for me. Yogi, your mother is not in the village. - What do you mean? - Yes. After seeing your love for your mother, I sent my men to bring your mother here. But your mother wasn't there. She came here looking for you. The letters you wrote to your mother have returned undelivered. Mom. What's happening? Why did you keep your whereabouts a secret from your mother? I thought she might take me back. Now I wrote my address, but the letters were returned. Poor lady! She has never left the village. I wonder how she came here and the troubles she is facing now. I will find my mother at any cost. Don't go alone. Your life will be in danger if Saidulu knows. Who the hell is Saidulu? What's the problem between him and me? You shouldn't have picked the sword. Once you take it, you can't leave it. Are you saying that to live, I should kill someone? I don't ask you to kill but to live. Help others live. A middle-class man struggles for 30 years to buy a piece of land. But they encroach on his land. Footpath dwellers struggle to earn 100 rupees a day. But they take 50 rupees from them. They suffer the most. You should not only live for your mother. But also for poor people like us. If something happens to you, - it's your mother who'll become an orphan. - Brother! Don't say that. I will be safe. Even my mother will be fine. I will find my mother. Hey! Hey! Prasad! Come, let's go. Oh! Prasad! Mother. Brother! Are you going out to find your mother? Go. If they get up, they will not let you go alone. Stay quiet. Looks like someone is here. Now the time is 1:00 a.m. Mallesh will kill Yogi in another 30 minutes. Mallesh, what happened? What's wrong? What happened? Venkat. Hey. Hey. You only know how to hold a knife. But I know how to use it. Hey! Come here. As soon as I open the door, chop him into pieces. You stand here. I will open the door and you kill... Run! Hey! Au... Auto, auto! Hey! It's us, man! Yogi... don't part with this knife. It will help the poor. - Prasad. - Mother. Mother! Where should I keep looking for you? Do you know how hard I am looking for you? Why did you leave me? Don't say that. Oh! Come on smile! Dance! I think he's thinking about his mother. I've booked everything. Even the Videocon fridge. Oh no! Videocon is the company's name. Like the "Mysore Bajji" doesn't really have Mysore in it. You won't find "video" in Videocon. We need to buy a new video player if we want one. - What's happening? - I've loaded everything. - Sony! - Do you want it, sir? No. - Anything else? - Nothing. - Take it. - What is it? The bill sir. - I told you that I need nothing. - You must settle this bill amount. Settlement? I must do it. Give me a moment. Hello, brother Yogi. Someone wants to settle the bill here. He said that he is coming here to settle the bill. I forgot to pack the home theater for you. Do you want one? No, thanks. He will come and take what he wants. - Think of them as legs. - Why? I have legs! - I was mistaken! - That's okay, man! Hey! Come here. - Me? - Yes. He must be calling you. I called you. Why me? Do you know Yogi? He will kill you all. - Hey! Get down. - Gently. On, God! - How much did you make? - Just two lakhs. - Tell me the truth. - Six lakhs. - Take them out. - Take this money, bro. I have invested the rest in Margadarsi chit funds. I'll give it next month. - Remove your clothes. - Okay I will. Hello. From which area? Very posh. Jubilee Hills. And you? - Punjagutta. - Your profession? - Real estate. - Oh! - And you? - Me too. You bloody liar! How many of you are in real estate? One says Hi-tech City. Another one says FAB City. One says Kokapet. And another says Gandipet. One says a car company would come. Another one says roads will be laid. Since every Tom, Dick, and Harry has entered into real estate, we are struggling for our livelihood. - You! - Hey! - Bro! - What is the problem here? It's all my anxiety. Even pickpockets like him are into real estate. My legs are aching sitting here. Please let us meet Yogi. There he is. Look. Brother, I beg you. Please leave us. Whatever you have swindled from the poor using my name, should be returned back to them in two days. If you fail to do so... We will return the money. We are mere puppets. But Saidulu and Goddesu are the real swindlers. Keep them under control. Do you need this place worth millions for you to live? These laborers were once farmers in their villages. They came here to seek a livelihood. Won't you let them live even here? Why is he after us? Hereafter, no one should give money to anyone. If anyone lays their hand on your hard-earned money, chase and hit him like a dog. Let it be anyone. Anyone. Fear no one. I'm scared when someone brings up his name. Go for the surgery and save my child by all means, sir. Doesn't she know that she will give birth to a child while fooling with her husband? She should have saved money for the surgery and then gotten pregnant. A doctor is greater than God because he saves lives. Not all jobs are done to earn money. Forgive me for hitting you. Name this girl Shantamma. You are a very good guy. May your house turn into gold Oh, my angel! I'll imprison myself on your lap May you become my pleasures Oh, my handsome!

Welcome to our studio. Sir, relax for five minutes. I will call you when everything is ready. - Sandhya, show him the room. - Okay. - Shankar. - Yes, ma'am. Mr. Yogi is here. Arrange for the live telecast. Fast. Quick! Bro, what sin did I commit that my life became like this? I used to live happily and have fun in my village. Why should my mother stay away from me? Shall I tell you something? Good and bad deeds of our previous birth are the happiness and sorrows that we experience in this birth. I witnessed my son getting hit by a lorry and killed. Did he fall under the lorry intentionally? Or, did the lorry driver intentionally kill him? It's the game of fate. Don't worry. Nowadays, there is no place without a TV set. Your mother will definitely watch this program somewhere. A special guest has come to our program today. He is none other than Mr. Yogi. Wow! Yogi! Greetings. Everyone knows about me. - I feel very happy to talk to you. - Auntie! What is it? I've told you about Yogi, right? - He is on a TV show. - Really? -Come here, Auntie. Quick -I am coming. Damn! Why are you so upset? The power goes off every time at moments like this. What is this nonsense when there is a crazy show on TV? Hey, can it be fixed or not? There is no problem here. The fault might be in the transformer. In this world, I have nobody other than my mother. I live for my mother. Slowly. Step on the brakes. It's all yours. Go. -Hi -Stupid. Call me whatever. Go away. I'm unable to walk properly. Why are you walking like that? Practicing Yoga. It hasn't healed yet! Go away. I must send the old man to the toilet. Oh, God! Who invented the steps? - Hey, catch the ball. - Oh, God! If I get hit by that ball, I can't sleep in either direction. I will go that way and rest until these children finish their game. What's with this cricket? It gives us nothing. Oh no! Not even air is flowing. Can't you go to the other side? You stopped a ball that was about to touch the boundary. Idiot! The water is to be mixed in the milk but not the other way around. Goddesu's milk has a good market value. Don't spoil that reputation. Mix properly. - Wash the buffalo properly. - Boss, Saidulu is coming here. Hey, get the knives. He shouldn't cross the gate. Boss, let's chop him. Let's kill him. Give us permission, boss. Krishna, calm down. I knew he would come. But I didn't expect that you'd bring him. He feels bad for what happened. He's been requesting me for a month to compromise with you. Poor guy! Forgive him. - He was once your disciple, right? - Yes. But he and Narsing tried to kill me. They missed. Narsing died and he lost power. Now he wants my support. So, he came here with the cop. Forget it. - It would be good if both of you unite. - Good for whom? For you? No. I have no selfish motives in this. Trust me. Zip it. To trust you is like climbing up a live electric pole. He is the same old man. Come and fall at his feet. Boss, it was my fault. Please forgive me. He has changed. Keep him with you. He will listen to you. I assure you. - Really? - Yes, boss. I will do anything you say. Kill him. - Kill him. - Hey! What is this? An understanding between God and his devotee. You brought him to me. And he tried to kill you. Don't you understand how wicked he is? Hey, you scoundrel! Kill and bury him. - I'll ensure that no case is filed. - Hey! Don't make noise. The buffaloes would be disturbed. I've even milked a bull. This idiot is nothing. Go to work. I will take care of this idiot. You scoundrel! You're still the same. Yogi, let me tell you some universal truth as I'm an elder. Past is past. Forget the past. From today, Saidulu will not cross your path. Forget him. He will do his business. - What do you say? - Does business mean cheating the poor, and killing innocents? - I won't accept. - That's common in our business. Common for you, not for me. - Actually... - No. I said no and that's final. No. Stop. How dare you threaten him? Are you a big goon? My single punch will kill you. Shut up, you idiot! Make no noise. You are a new buffalo in this compound. What do you know about him? Out of his way. You can go, my son. Step away. Why did you stop me? I would have punched him to death. That's why I stopped you. Krishna, seems like we have some luck today. - He has returned from the verge of death. - Yes, boss. Why are you keeping quiet? What does he think of himself? It was you who got him released from prison. And you made him a big shot. - Yes. - He is disrespecting even you. What shall we do now? He's very arrogant. Let's kill him. You rascal! - What's wrong with you, Krishna? - I don't like it. I don't want Yogi to be killed. Traitors! Cheats! We live on people's blood. He is helping people to live by stopping us. For us to live, he must die. No more second thoughts. Hello. What? - I want to meet Yogi. - He doesn't speak to girls. Why? What's wrong with girls? Didn't Yogi tell you not to come after him? Why did you come again? - To get his interview. - That's impossible. You can leave. Hey, girl. He asked you to come in. You can go. Thank you. See you. Did he really ask her to come? - No. It was my decision. - Why? No girl comes to see us even if we call them. When she has come for him, why should we send her away? How many times should I tell you not to visit me? What do you want to know about me? I don't, I want people to know about you. A lot of people in the city like you for your good deeds. So, what do you want to say? If I write a news article about you, I will clear the practical exams and become a journalist. Please. Tell me about yourself to get my degree at least. Please. There is nothing much to tell you. Thousands of people come to this city every day to find work. Similarly, I came to the city. Where should I search the temple Basha told me about? Lord Shiva, please see that I get a job in no time. So that I can buy gold bangles for my mother, go back to my village and meet her. Got it? Brother. Where is Basha's... - Where is Basha's house? - Where is Basha's house? Which Basha? Don't you know Basha? Bethamcherla Basha. Thank God! I've found someone to sponsor my food. He told me that everyone around this temple knows him. - Brother. - I told you, I don't know him. - Did you come for Basha? - Bro, do you know Basha? Know him? It was me who got him the job. Bro, you are superb! Take me to Basha. - Let's go. - See you. - Give my regards to the SI. - Okay. Brother, get three plates of chapati, idli, and dosa. He caught an innocent scapegoat. It's just the two of us. Why did you order three portions? I ordered just for me, brother. Bro, that's a lot of food. No, that's very less. I'm very a busy person, I'll have no time to eat. Hence, I eat all three meals at once. - Chotu, how are you doing? - Fine. Bro, you have a machine in your stomach. Otherwise, how can you digest so much food every time? Hey, he is a very busy man. He won't eat three times a day. - He eats all three meals at once. - Yes. He is very busy. That's why he eats all three meals at once. Hey! Idiot! Useless fellow. Get lost. Useless fellow! - Bro, didn't both of say the same thing? - Of course, brother. He is just a kid, so he confused us. He does it every day. Don't talk for some time. - The food is getting cold. - Bro, you eat. Look, you have to make chapatis softer. Seems like it would take a lot of time to digest. Hey, don't you have any work other than eating and digesting it? No work? He is a very busy person. That's why he eats all three meals at once. Right, bro? Brother, you shouldn't say that here and especially not to him. - How much is it? - It is 85 rupees. Do you have change for 500 rupees? I've got change even for 1,000 rupees. Give me the money. How will you manage if you give me all the change? Brother, do you have any change? - Yes, I do. - Give it. Poor guy! - What is your friend's name? - Basha. What does he do? You said you know everything about him. Oh, brother! I remember everything before having food. I forget everything after having food. Do one thing. Sit here. I will go and bring him I'll also find a job for you. - Don't go anywhere. Sit here. - Okay. How much is the bet? It is 1000 rupees. - Is it 1000 rupees? - Yes. If people are earning happily, they'll even place a bet of 10,000 rupees. - Distribute the cards. - What's the matter? Give the phone to Saidulu. Yes, tell me. Boss, Goddesu is coming alone in an Esteem car. Which road is he traveling from? Durgamma Lake Road. He is with Krishna. What is the car number? Who are you waiting for? Brother. He won't come. Take this blanket and sleep. Wake up in the morning and go back to your village. Unlike your village, everyone here lives by cheating others. Brother, curse me but not this city. This is such a good place. Upon arriving here, he came to me and promised to get me a job. - Where will you find a city like this? - Your wish! I am telling you again. Catch the first bus tomorrow morning and go back to your village. I'm telling you again, I won't leave this city until I get a job. Let's sleep. He will wake me up. Bro, the song is superb. The song is alright but the beer is not cold. - Really? - Open that. Boss! Hey! - Boss. - What is happening? - Boss! - Hey! Boss! Boss! Boss! - Hey! - Stop! Let's go. Bro? Bro. Is there a hospital nearby? Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! It's alright, bro. You will be fine. Just hold your breath. Doctor. - Doctor. - What? What happened? They lost a lot of blood. Save them by all means. Come on. Fast. Sister, who admitted Goddesu? Sir, I brought them here. - You? - Yes, it is me. POLICE STATION Since how long have you been working for the Goddesu gang? I neither know who Goddesu is nor the guys who tried to kill him. Then, why did you admit them to the hospital? Why do you ask? Is it wrong to help someone? Tell me. Saidulu has escaped. Those who were caught are being questioned. The one who got them admitted to the hospital is ignorant. He knows nothing. Bro, what's with this city? They're beating me up for doing good. Tell them to let me go. - Greetings, sir. - What is it? It is about that guy. He is in no way connected to the last night's incident. Yes. I swear on my God. I am innocent. Keep quiet. You are eating my head since last night. - Mr. Venkateshwar Rao. - Sir. - Is he on the crime list? - No, sir. He came to the city yesterday. He is innocent. I will take responsibility for him and sign the papers. - Please let him go. - What is his name? His name is Yogi. Look, I used my dead son's name to get you out. Go back to your village. Just now you said I'm your son. Why are you asking me to leave then? Give me a job. ATTACKS GANG WARS THIS IS THE SITUATION IN THE CITY LAND MAFIA BROTHERS No fragrance can match the smell of money. Yes, boss. It's mesmerizing. Boss, Goddesu has survived. He has filed a case against us. The Inspector is itching to take action on us. - Talk to the DSP. - Call him. - Boss, sister is on the line. - Which sister? - Kukatpalli Dhanalakshmi. - Damn! Greetings, Mr. DSP. - I came there a day before yesterday. - Mr. Narsing wants to talk to you. I'll come next week. Boss, DSP is on the line. Hold the line. Hello, DSP. We will be good as long as you are there for us. It seems our Saidulu has been charged with Goddesu's murder case as A1. He's just a kid, sir. Just a kid. You've caught three people, right? Make them A1, A2, A3, and make Saidulu A4. Inform the inspector of that station to write the same over the phone. I'll take care of the bail later. - Idiot, do you want to be kicked? - Hey, DSP is on the line. - Shut your mouth. - Gag his mouth and beat him. Shut your mouth, rascal! A small settlement here. I'll send your payment by the end of the month. - Bloody. - Boss, sister. Oh! Hello. Whiskey is not available in the market, I'll send brandy, drink it. Have you got anyone on to guard at her home? Mallesh and Venkat are on duty. Don't use men, send women. - She's not human if she gets intoxicated. - Gag his mouth. What's his problem? It seems he wants the highway toll gate tender. - Goddesu supports him. - Hey, stop it. You don't care for human life. To kill a man, you need a good reason to do it. Ask him for the reason. Will you give up your tender? - Give up the tender. - No, I won't. Look, we have a reason now. We can kill him now. SIX MONTHS LATER How is my outfit? You look like a hero. Brother. They are shining. It will get shinier when my mother wears them. You're perseverant. You achieved your aim. How much amount do you need to travel? Our boss has come to the site. - Send tea immediately. - Okay, brother. Immediately, prepare special tea for the boss. Yogi, deliver the tea to the site. Brother, my outfit might get spoiled. Just now you called me a hero and now, you want me to deliver tea. Chotu isn't here. Please deliver it. No, brother. I'm getting late for the bus. I have to quickly reach my home town and meet my mother. - Please deliver this one last time. - Okay. I'll not come back. I'll directly go to my village after delivering the tea. Mad boy. Brother, tea. Boss, he's the one who saved Goddesu. Take it, brother. Rip out his skin and send it to him. Shivers will run down his spine. Take it, brother. Why do you bother if anyone dies on the road? What do you mean? Why did you take the dying man to the hospital? Oh! Those people? How can I leave a dying man? You must leave him, bastard! Abusing my mother? What did she do to you? What did my mother do to you, you bastard? - Hey! - Hey! Hold on. Move. Come here. Come. - Are you fine? - I don't want all this trouble. I'm going away to my home town, please leave me alone. - What's that? - Bangles. It's for my mother. Let me see it. Is it for your mother or some hooker? Please don't say bad things, it's wrong. Return it, I'll go away. You can go. You're very proud. That's why you dared to grab my brother's shirt. I consider those bangles as my mother. Don't play with them. Return them. Oh! Is it your mother? Boss! Boss! Oh no! I shouldn't stay here. Oh, God! Boss, where are you going? He's beating up everyone out there. Come, let's go away. Saidulu. Mother Goddess! Please take me to my son. Bloody bastard! Mother! How dare you stamp on my mother's bangles! Do you know what a mother is? Bastard! Mother, I didn't kill him intentionally. Damn! Chanti? Let's take him to the hospital. Go. Start the car. Search for the bastard. Who are you searching for? You know who I'm searching for. You also know the reason. If anything happens to my people, I'll not spare anyone. Whoever it might be. Boss, we searched the entire place. He's not here. Warn Saidulu, that my blood is aggressive and my sword is sharp. I'll be calm if he stays good. But if he messes up with me, I'll behead him. Warn him. Hey, Krishna! Did you hear his indirect threat? He warned us using Saidulu's name. - Did you get it? - I got it. Sorry, brother. Bloody sorry! I made a perfect plan. But you failed miserably. I missed the bullet by inches. His sword won't miss like your bullet. Be alert. - Boss. - What? Saidulu tried to kill us. Yogi saved your life. We've committed a lot of sins. Don't add one more by killing Yogi. Can we let a holy basil plant grow on the hemp plantation? We weed it out. We do exactly that in our business. Hail Lord Shiva! Lord, if I steal near my mosque, they'll mince me like meat. So, I'm here at your temple. Please forgive me for my sins. Please give us alms. There are more beggars than devotees. Nonsense! Oh, sweet boy! You are very cute. Sir, your son looks exactly like you. Hey, he's my son. Really? Then you look exactly like your son. Silly! You finish it quickly. When you grow up, you have to earn a lot and buy gold. Don't buy anything else. There will be many uncles like me, right? - Mommy. - Oh, man! - Why is he calling his mother? - That uncle. Who, dear? - That uncle in a black shirt. - So what? - Chocolate. - You keep asking me for chocolate. Let's buy it on the way back. Thank, God! The danger passed away. - Oh no! I'll return it, sir. - It's me. Prasad. - Which area's SI are you? - Turn back. Hey, Prasad! When did you come here? - Why didn't you meet me? - Where should I search for you? You gave this temple's address and asked me to come here. You were not here, where else do I have to look for you? The thing is, a new open-air temple was built in Chanchalguda, I was forced to live there for six months. They have built a jail in Chanchalguda. But when did they construct a temple? They did. They have constructed a temple inside it. All the priests sport khaki uniforms and offer prayers reciting Sanskrit mantras. Do you mind it? Well, how is your mother back in the village? - Mother is not in the village. - Then? She's here. My son has me and I have my son. Except that, we have no one else for us. Lord, please unite us. It's my responsibility to unite you both. I have a good network here. You gave the address, right? I'll bring your mother there. Okay? Hey! - Prasad, I'll meet you later. - Hey. Stop! He is the one, Mommy. Hail Lord Shiva! Oh, Lord Shiva Oh, Lord Shiva What sort of a game is this? Please unite the mother and son Show mercy, oh lord Why did you call me urgently? - How did you get hurt? - A guy thrashed me up. Who the hell is he? He's the guy who is going to marry the girl I loved. - He bashed me up for trying to stop him. - Who is he? He's a man with a split personality. Split personality? What does it mean? He's like Vikram in the movie Aparichithudu. If he's like Vikram, - I'm Rajinikanth from Chandramukhi. - Hey. How long will you hang on to those movies? Please adjust for one last time. Okay, go ahead. Where is he now? - What's your name? - Kumari. Though the name doesn't have any quality, your face does. - What are those? - Bananas. Why aren't they in bunches? - What's this? - Silk sari. Where's the silk in this? - What are those? - Sweets. Why didn't you cover it? Nobody is concerned about cleanliness or is responsible to follow the rules. Nobody knows anything about quality. It's irresponsibility everywhere. Cleanliness. Brother, someone is bashing up our people. Oh no! Hey! Okay. Hey! Hey. - Are you the groom? - Yes, sir. Come on inside. Hey. Either marry the girl you love or the girl who loves you. Why are you marrying someone else's lover, idiot? Sir, my wedding got canceled 37 times to date. Please don't spoil it this time. Hey. Why are you pleading, man? It seems you have a split personality. Who is seeing the bride now? You or the other man? Ask him to come out. Come on. Come on, I say. - What's the date today? - January 10th. He won't get up until February 10th. In the meantime, I'll get you married to the man you love. - Come on. - Bloody fool! - Why did you change your voice? - It wasn't me. - Why did you hit him? - Who? Oh, God! Why did you fall down, sir? Why did you fall when you hit me, sir? You don't know about me. You don't know about me. What were you saying about love just now? - When did I talk about love? - Why are you trembling, sir? Stay with this personality, I'll go. - Sir. - Oh! To date, 37 people had ruined my wedding. I killed all 37 people. If you do the same, I'll kill you as well. Will you kill me for a small mistake? If you spoil one marriage, - it's a small mistake. - Yes, sir. What if ten people spoil ten marriages ten times? That's also a mistake. What if 37 people spoil 37 marriages 37 times? That's a mistake of some sort. If all these little mistakes combine and become one big mistake, thereby ruining a guy's life, how will he get married? But it is said that marriages are made in heaven. Go to hell! - Why are you doing this, sir? - You're killing me. Hey! I saw Brahmanandam, Sunil, MS Narayana, Venu Madhav in my life. But you're an actor beyond excellence. I love you. Not you but the other guy. I'm hitting you like a hero, but why the hell are you comparing me with comedians? Do you know my punishment for people like you? - I don't know, sir. - Louder. - I don't know! - Hey! I don't know, sir. If you spoil an engagement, you will be crushed to death. If you spoil a wedding, you'll be boiled alive till death. If you spoil a honeymoon, you'll be thrown to insects to be eaten alive. If you spoil a matchmaking ceremony, you'll be pierced with a spear. Spear piercing? What's that? Is it like ear piercing? I can never understand this man. Hey! Why did you bring the lampstand here, sir? It was you... it was you who brought it here, sir. Me? Why? Did you forget about the punishment? - Spear punishment. - Oh! It was a mistake to remind you. - I plead with you. Please let go. - Sit on it. Why are you sitting on the lamp stand when there are chairs, sir? Strange people and strange tastes! Nicely pierced! As if he is Rajinikanth! I have also watched movies and learned tricks. I don't have a split personality disorder. Hey. I'll marry only you. Thanks. What are you saying, sir? This is Shantamma's story and that's Yogi's story. Her son is a simple innocent villager. Yogi is a notorious goon. How can they both be the same man? Is there any rule barring innocents from becoming goons? - No, sir. - Your research isn't up to the mark. You're missing some details. There's a son in her story. There's a mother in his story. - Why shouldn't they be the same? - Why should they? If it is true, your article will become a sensational hit. Why do you always find fault with my articles, sir? All you want is details about Yogi's parents, right? - Yes. - I'll get it right now. - Chotu, come here. - What's it, Uncle? Why is she after Yogi despite my repeated warnings? Girls are like that, they follow when you refuse. - You're an old man in a young body. - Because I'm a child laborer, Uncle. Shut up! I'll be in trouble if the government finds out. - Just send her away. - Okay. - Hi, Chotu. - What is it, sister? - Isn't Yogi here? - No. Wherever I go, I hear the same answer that he just left. - He himself doesn't know where he'll be. - Give me a clue. He might be scared of you and run away to some desert. - Go, boy. - I'll go. Yogi, are you in the desert? What are you doing in the desert? Though you're serving a penance in the desert, I'll not leave you. I'll ring the bells with you I'll rake up the raging fire in you I'll caress you with my kisses I'll encourage you with my lips I'll launch a love war I'll blow the war bugle right now I'll show you the garden of love I'll counter-attack you immediately I'll ring I'll rake I'll show my prowess I'll remove all your doubts I'll make you forget sainthood And drown you in carnal love I'll give up the life Of an ascetic for you I'll perform the sacrifice of love And spread it all over you I'll give you what I've never given To any man and the celebrate love I'll give rest to desires And give you delight every moment Come, let's unite fast Beauty is inviting you with arms open I'll ring the bells with you Touch my feet and slowly spread over me Kiss my knees, I like it I'll caress your waist And conquer you slowly I'll stroke your body with mine lustily Beauty is mine but experiences are ours Exploring is my duty World of bliss is ours Hare Rama!

I'll ring the bells with you I'll encourage you with my lips I'll launch a love war I'll blow the war bugle right now I'll show you the garden of love I'll counter-attack you immediately I'll ring I'll rake I'll ring Yogi. Hi. What? Why did you come here again? Yogi, why are you angry with me? I searched for you all over the place. Okay, come to the point. You didn't give your full name and details about your parents. It's not that I didn't give, you didn't ask. My native place is Bethamcherla. What? Bethamcherla. My native place is Bethamcherla near Kurnool. Your mother's name? Shantamma. You... Your full name? Eeshwar Prasad. Yogi. What happened? Why are you so excited? Do you have a phone here? It's inside. - Hello. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Your doubt turned true. Yogi is none other than Shantamma's son. Oh, great! Sir, I can never forget that I united a mother and son. Boss! Uncle... What happened to my brother? Tell this to his mother immediately. See how happy she will feel. Yogi, stop. Stop. Your mother is at my house. Yogi. - Brother. - Yes. Why here? They are middle-class people, we'll not get much. Hey, Shahrukh Khan! We are like the chit fund company. My target is the middle class. Though we rob so many people any number of times, not a soul will squeak. As many middle-class people, rob them as many times. May it be banks or finance companies, Kokapet land or flats, all the middle class gets in tears. - Advance... - What does it mean? I too don't know. Our target is the middle class. So you go to the Gowliguda bus stand. - Okay. - Go away, don't show your face to me. - Hey, boy! What's your dad's name? - Janardhan? - Janardhan? What does he do? - SI. Are you SI Janardhan's son? If you wear a chain outside, thieves may steal it. It was bought by your father with the money he stole from us. Take it into your hands and then put it safely into my pocket. Hey! Why did you take the chain? That is... I was playing hide and seek. I'll hide behind the pillar with this chain, I'll return the chain with chocolate - if you come and catch me. - Okay. - Start counting to 100. Count. - One, two... There are many farms in my village, - mangoes, guavas... - Sister Shantamma. Basha. Auntie! Auntie, I found your son. Did you meet Prasad? Not only met him but he gave me his address as well. Where are you, Auntie? Bunty, come here. Tell sister that I found my son and I'm going to him. - My lovely boy! - Okay. Come, let's go fast. Where did she go? Did you see Auntie? She said she found her son and went to him. Oh, God! Brother. What happened? Saidulu warned us to leave this city, or else he threatened to kill Chotu. Where is Chotu? Boss, Yogi is here. I'll kill you if you smile. Do I look like a fool? Hey! Get chilly powder. Not a single person must go out. Hey, Saidulu! Hey! Hey! Mother! Come, sister. Greetings, brother. Mr. Prasad used to live here. - Who? - Eeshwar Prasad from Bethamcherla. There is no one by that name. This is the hotel of Mr. Babai. It was burnt due to rivalry. Going by the books, there is no Prasad living here. - This was the address given to me. - Get lost! Hell with your bullshit! Sister, don't worry. Today is Monday, right? He told me that he will go to Lord Shiva's temple every Monday. Let's go there. Hey! Hey! Hey, come. You scoundrels! Sister, what will you do if you see Prasad now? I will take him back to our village. - Hey! - Oh, God! Sister. Sister, are you okay? Oh no! What's all this? This is quite common in this city. Oh, my God! My son shouldn't stay in such a city. I must take him back to our village immediately. Come, let's go. Yogi, no. I beg you. Please, let me go. I will never cross your path. Please, let me go. I beg you. Why? I was leaving for my village but you dragged me into this. You are responsible for me being violent. You are responsible for my separation from my mother. You are responsible that I am like this. What did I do to you? What wrong did I do? Bloody idiot! Yogi, I'll leave Hyderabad. I beg you. Please let me go. I will never cross your path. Please let me go. I beg you. - Brother, kill him. Kill him! - Shut up! Kill. Isn't there anything else? My life has become like this after killing just one man. Hey! Go anywhere. - Do not cross my path. - Okay. - Else you'll be the last man I'd kill. - Okay. Yogi. You will never reform. I taught him to go to Lord Shiva's temple every Monday. He would be very happy to see me here. I don't know if he'll be happy, but you might jump with joy. - Hey! - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Have you also started to enter temples? SI wants to meet you. Let's go. My childhood friend promised to come here. I am waiting for him. - I will meet him later. - Stop giving excuses. Let's go. Just a minute. Why are the cops here? The inspector is my close friend. He wants to talk to me. - I will come back in just five minutes. - Basha, Prasad will come, right? He'll come. I'll also be back in a few minutes. You stay here. Why did you bring me here? - I wanted to go to the temple. - Not today. - Why? - Not today. I can't stop going to the temple. Let's go. Please listen to me. We killed Saidulu just now. At home or the temple, your life is in danger. No one is aware of this place. Stay here for tonight. What danger? Everything happens according to our fate. - We don't have to fear anyone. - Shut up. You can go to the temple tomorrow morning. Please listen to me this time. What great deeds did she do? To get blessed by Lord Shiva Redamma, what happened? I don't know whether the child is alive or not but he is not crying. What are you saying? He is not able to breathe properly. It may be difficult for him to survive. How could you say that? He is Eeshwar Prasad. I got him after years of marriage. Give me my child. My child should be fine. I will sacrifice my life to save him. This mother has blessed him By giving a new life to this child With her breath - Basha, I will also jump. - You don't have to give money. Jump. Oh, God! After separating From the child you gave me This mother is alone now Oh, God! On seeing tears In the mother's eyes Hasn't your heart melted? If you had Such a mother You would know her pain Can't your eye see her grief? Can't you wipe her tears away? Oh, God! Calling my mother With all my heart Is enough Come, brother. Unite the mother with her son Who raised him like a friend If you know the sweetness of mother's milk My Lord You might've decoded the language Of a mother's love for her child Please tell him, Goddess Parvati Mother means worship What great deeds did she do To get blessed by Lord Shiva This mother has blessed By giving a new life to this child With her breath Mother. Mother. Instead of getting drenched all night, you could've sat under the shade. Looks like the temple was built for the poor and not for the Gods. Oh no! Shantamma, didn't Prasad come yet? My friend didn't leave me last night. Come. Take bath and eat something. Come on. Shantamma! Shantamma. What's all this? Hey, Prasad! Get the car ready. We should go to the temple now. Oh, my God! A dead body in front of the temple on a Tuesday! Take away the body. Sir, she had only one son. But she died without seeing him. Let him at least see her dead body. I beg you. Give me some time. He didn't come yesterday, will he come today? Remove the dead body. We must clean the temple. Shantamma... I failed to show you your son. I also failed to show you to your son. Please forgive me, Shantamma. What happened? I don't know, brother. Something must be damaged. You sit inside the car. I will get a mechanic. I'll walk to the temple. The temple is very nearby. Brother, don't go alone. You said that everything happens according to our fate. Why fear? Hey! Stop the car. Hey, Basha! Stop. Won't you meet us if you change the area? I heard that you stole a chain from an apartment. You didn't settle the accounts. Sir, she is from my village. I am taking her to perform the last rites. I will come to the station once everything is over. - Does the dead body belong to him? - We don't know. He gave us money to lift it. You are acting too smart. You have taken away all her jewels. Won't you spare even a dead body? Please, don't say that. She is like my mother. Even a dead body will become your relative if it has a gold chain. She is a Hindu and you are a Muslim. How could she be your mother? Sir, communal differences are rampant in the cities. In our village, all the communities live in harmony. Are you trying to teach us? Come. - Please listen to me. - Come and get inside the vehicle. Take the body to the cemetery. I will come soon. - Alright. - Get in. Hey, let's go! Hey, stop! Why only four of you are carrying the body? Do you expect 400 to carry it? It is an anonymous dead body. Oh, really? Brother, we struggle very hard to live in this world. At least death should be a smooth sail. We should happily take it to the cemetery. My mother told me this. I will come with you to the cemetery. Can we get drums here? Lord, it's your game to make A son attend his mother's funeral Without knowing it When tears roll down Why are you making us smile? She is the old lady who lived in our aunt's house. The poor lady is dead. How long should we wait? It's Yogi without any guards. CREMATORIUM - Thanks for coming. - Flies are hovering. We all will be blessed. Hey, boy! There are power cuts in this area. The power might go off in ten minutes. I can't tell you when it will come again. - Bring the dead body fast. - I will get a garland. The market is very near. Wait for two more minutes. Why waste your time and our time? If the power goes off, we have to stay here till the power is back. We did everything. Let's do this as well. Just two minutes. Come fast. If you are late, we will complete the last rites. Hey, bald-headed! Are you sure? Sure. He is alone. If you order us to kill him, we will. Kill him. But make sure you take care of it later. Kill him until he is really dead. Best of luck. Okay, boss. Hey, Krishna! We got that Yogi. Narsing died, Saidulu died, and now Yogi will die. Now the city will be in my control. No. Don't kill Yogi. He saved us from the clutches of death. He is a good guy. It's wrong to kill him. Give me a garland. For who? An unclaimed dead body. Let me finish the last rites. Brother, I asked you not to kill him. Call them. You are a slave. Behave like a slave. Don't try to teach me. I'll kill you. Hey! Hey! I may not have legs but I am faithful. If you are ready to kill someone who saved your life, you must not live. Hey! Kill him. One man left the body in the middle. Another man came here to get a garland. Will he come? He says that the power may go off. Shall we go ahead? He went to get a garland. He did all this. Let him at least have a last look at the dead body. I said no. Can't you understand? Are you crazy? Hey! Look, he won't come back. Bring the body. This is very common to unclaimed dead bodies. Bring it. Hey! Brother, it's good for people, if we die and you live. You go. Go on, boss. At least in your next birth, don't be born as an orphan. Basha, why are you here? Why are you here? An unclaimed dead body. I brought the dead body to the cemetery. I did all the last rites. My mother would be happy if she knows about this. Didn't you see her? No. She is your mother. My mother? Why would my mother die? If you can't find her, leave it. I will find her. Why do you say that my mother is dead? What is this idiot saying? He doesn't know what to say and what not to say. He says that she was my mother. Why would my mother die? Not even my enemy should face this situation. Why aren't you saying anything? Say that he is lying. Tell me that he is lying. Yogi, he is telling you the truth. Yes, Uncle. Grandma used to live in her house. I saw you taking Grandma away. So I brought her here. Here are your mother's clothes and letters. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Stop, Yogi. - Listen to me. - Mother! Keep quiet. She is my mother. They say our past life's bad deeds affect us in this life, no, you pay for your sins in this life, instant justice. Be it for good or bad, it's wrong to turn to violence. It's a sin. Like this... my mother. Mother. Mother. Mom. I came here to take good care of you. But I couldn't even see your face. When will I see you again? Prasad, come here. Mother. Why are you crying? I didn't go anywhere. I am with you. Shall we dance? Dance. Mother? Mother! Mother. Yogi.
