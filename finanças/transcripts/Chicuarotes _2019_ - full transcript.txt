One, please. What a coincidence! Are you going to work too, little clown? No, I'm actually going down-clown. Why don't you tell me... What's your favorite food? My favorite food is Bs. Are you saying you eat bees? No, I like the Bs in the alphabet soup! Oh, well, do you know what I like best? That kefir. What? No, I meant to say you like coffee best... Stop being so cheeky and vulgar! Tell me, do you know who the last saint is? The last saint? Do you know who the last saint is? No, who is it? It's Saint S'Over. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen... We're not the best actors or comedians, but we rather do this kind of things, than be punks, criminals who rob you from your belongings, your money. We prefer making you smile to making you afraid. We only ask you for some spare change. It could be one peso... -Do you? Do you? -Some spare change? -Do you have some spare change? -Do you have some spare change? -Over here? No? -Some spare change... Nobody? Nobody? Gotta be kidding me. People are fucking tight, man! Not a fucking peso! Can you believe it? Fuckers. Well, we should have rehearsed a bit. Well, that's what I think. Just saying. Fuck it! Fuck rehearsing! Listen, motherfuckers! We tried being nice, but now you're fucked, assholes! You, fucker, take it out. Put everything over here! Everything you have on you! Hurry, man, help me out! You keep driving, keep driving, nothing is happening! Over here, dammit! Get it all, damn! Over here, this motherfucker! Quick! You keep driving, and start pulling over, man. -Sorry. -Little by little... damn right! We're getting off, damn right. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed the show! Don't forget to eat some bread for the scare. What are you going to do? What do you think? Piss is 2 pesos. Shit is 5 pesos. Two shits. -Dude... -What? -This one is dope for you. Keep it. -Oh, yeah... Dope! We only got cheap junk, not even an iPhone! These are only worth the minutes they have left. Check this out! Whoa, wait. This isn't a piñata. I'm just showing it to you! "Circus Show... Like in Las Vegas." It's one of those casinos, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. Check this out, Moloteco! Check it out! It's like I told you. In five hours, we barely made seventy pesos. And now, a single easy hit and we're loaded. Yeah, but... What? Are you scared? With a piece, nobody gets in your face. -Is it Baturro's? -Yeah. I'm not saying we should do it all the time. Once in a while, it's fine. If we only do the routine... we're screwed. That's how Cantinflas started... Aren't you fed up going all the way downtown? It's worse to return, man. Fucking two-bit town! Do you really make good money? Can you believe this dude? Look. Damn! Some days I don't even make 200 pesos. Tell fucking Miguel to pay you more! He doesn't pay me. He gives me a quarter of the fares. And you don't even make 200 pesos? You're so fucked, Paestrudo. Nah, this is just for now. As soon as I save some money, my uncle will get me a job at the Electricity Commission. -That's for fucking electricians? -Yes. My uncle works for the union. And for 20 grand, he'll set me up with a job. What do you know about electricity, dude? Nothing! There's no need. Those dudes don't do nothing! Once you have a job there, you have a steady paycheck for the rest of your life! They can't fire you! Plus, you get housing credit, health insurance, and you retire with shit loads of money! Do you really won't work your ass off? Nah! They'll have you at a desk, playing dumb all day. Get the 20 grand, I'll call my uncle, and the job is yours! I can't stand the fucking rhoids! There are times I cry when I'm on the crapper. So now you're going to say the bus is to blame. We all know Piedra loves to fuck you in the ass. Just blow him instead. Cut it or you're off. -I'm fucking shaking! -I warned you! Quit your whining and share some. -Hey, give it back! -Fuck you, let's go, Moloteco! Fuck, man! Give it back! -Hey! -Wait... -What's up? -Come here. -What is it? -I just wanted to chat with you. -Right now? -Yeah. Wanna go to the church garden? Girl, stay away from that good-for-nothing. Ugh, so ugly! Look, Sugheili, I'll see you later, OK? Take these. I'll find you. Give me a kiss. On the cheek! Check your Whats! I have no data! Wait, wait. There are two of us. Remember this is for those who are most in need. Those who lost their homes, their jobs. -Yeah, yeah. -Please! Hi, yes. -Did she leave lipstick on me? -Yeah. I don't care what you have to do! -But... what do I do? -Come, come! What do I know, stupid bitch! -I don't have it, I swear! -The gun. -Bullshit! -Take it! Hide it! I don't have it! I've never taken it from you! I swear it, Baturro! What the fuck are you doing here? Fuck off! What happened, Mom? Nothing, my son. Baturro says I hid his photo of that woman, Olga Breeskin. And you didn't? Why would I do it for? Fucking Baturro, he just likes imagining things. Come on in, my son. I'll wait for your sister, she went to get some quesadillas. -Come on in. -OK, Mom. Damn, man! I nearly shit myself when I saw Baturro. I thought he had noticed. Give it back! You're reading that damned book again? I bet you know it by heart. You should do something useful instead. Or at least watch your stash of movies. At least I can read. "At least I can read." Speak like a man! That's why they call you a fag! I don't give a damn about what your stupid friends say. You don't give a shit? So you don't care if I call you Tamal Lady? Because you give a shit. Stand up for yourself, fucking Tamal Lady! Bring me a champurrado. Hey, Tamal Lady, can I have two tamales? Give me my fucking tamal! Where the fuck is it? What happened? Some junkie grabbed Güily in the alley! Did you see his face? Did you see his face? Answer! I think it was Zaid. The guy from Santa Cruz. -Why didn't you defend yourself? -Motherfucker. I was carrying the quesadillas. -Come on, dude. -Let's go! -For real, man. -I thought you didn't know that word! Zaid, get up, asshole! What the fuck, Cagalera? Are you here to pay me back? I said, get up, asshole! Come on, you're crazy! What's wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you, dude? Do you think you can just come here and finger our women? Easy, dude! I didn't do anything! If you want to finger some woman up, then stick it up your mother's ass! Wait, Cagalera, what did I do? You wanted to fuck my sister, fucker! What the fuck? I don't want to see your face again in San Gregorio! Stay up there on your hill... Fucking backwoods brush ape! Wait. Easy, man. Apologize, fucker! Apologize or you're done for! The butcher is coming. Cagalera with a gun! Exactly what we needed! I have a... bone to pick with Zaid, but I wasn't gonna hurt him. We were just fooling around. -Is this fun to you? -No. -Is this fun to you? -No, sir! Is this fun to you? I feel so sorry for you. So young and so lost. Precisely now when our town needs to get up again. To rebuild itself! To be reborn form the ashes like a phoenix! What we have come to! Yeah, but the gun is Baturro's. I gotta give it back. Well, so then tell him to go to my shop and pay me back! -No, no, I really. -Damn! You want the gun? Have it then! What happened? Shit, Cagalera. Fuckers, aren't you gonna help me out of here? -Help me, dude. -Go fuck yourself! I don't know how the fuck you'll do it, but you're getting Baturro's gun back. You're out of your mind. Help me out. No, do not help him. That prick fingered my sister. That's the whole problem? This dude was with us the whole afternoon. Don't cover up for him, dude. It's true, dude. Your sister must be confused. -Asshole. -Something bit me. You'll pay Dr. Reyes bill! Bring him a fucking dog and stop whining! -A dog? -Yeah, a stray dog, it's true. -This is your fucking fault! -Get lost, fucker! -We'll go with you. -A stray dog? Let's go, it's OK. The gun, man! What's up, Cagalera? Are you still here, man? -Have you heard? -What? -You haven't. -What? Can you believe Cuácuaro got killed? Shut up! Yesterday, man. Beat the shit out of him. They found him by the market in Tulye... Was it over the gringo chicks? Nope. It was Chillamil, who just got out of jail. Cuácuaro didn't want to do time for him. -Yeah... -Fuck. They're having the wake for Cuácuaro at Conchita, dude. The burial is tomorrow. Plain, Moloteco? Really? I wanted butter. What? Cagalera, you really want to get in trouble again? That's the butcher's son! -Really? -Yeah. The fucker claims he swore off booze, so he won't let people see him with a beer. So he sends his kid to buy booze for him. Such a hypocrite! Oh, boy, you finally arrive. I was worried. Look at you! I'm OK. Look at you, boy! If you want... No, Mom! Let's do it tomorrow. Why is it locked? Did you find the fiend who assaulted Güily? I kicked the shit out of him. And you're still doing the same. I'm talking to you, dammit! I'm fucking sick of your damn cassettes. They're called "tapes," you idiot. This is good music! Not like the bullshit you listen to in the village. Oh, shut up. But, dude, you can't dance to that shit. But with some Cumbias. You just need a speaker... some chicks... you rub yourself against them... I'm telling you. What do you know! You have never ever danced with a chick, right? You're so fucking bitter. Mom, Cagalera is on my bed again! Move! -Move, I said! -Dammit. Now it's all wet, you fucking pig! Yeah, blame me! You're the one who pees on it. Yeah, right. What a temper, you fat ass. Next time, pay attention to who's fingering you. Zaid didn't do it. The hell he wasn't. I saw him clearly. Look... What? Look, dude, these are from Las Vegas. They are dope! Oh, God! -Where did you get it? -I hunted it. I'll beat the shit out of it. Come here, little turkey. Get going, bitch! Cook it. And make some tortillas, because I hate those machine-made ones. Baturro, it's late. And you're wasted. This is exactly what I needed from you. Wait, Baturro, stop. No, no, no... No, Baturro! Please. Stop! Stop, Baturro! Fucking lazy cunt! Please, stop! Fucking cunt! Stop! Leave her alone, Baturro! She's tired. -Oh, yeah? -Please! She's here to serve me. Just look, I'm the grandson of Belisario Domínguez. Nobody messes with Baturro. Nobody! Because I have my money, my pals and my piece. Not only do I have it, but I know how to use it, look... -I lost his gun. -Where's my piece? Where is my piece! Go, go! I'll hold him off. Go! You have it, right, cunt? Where the fuck is it? What did you do with it? Give it to me! Stop! Fuck off, fuck off! What happened to you? Nothing. Hey, can I come in? Just for a little bit. It's just that my dad already locked up. But why are you like this? It's nothing. What's wrong? Let's get out of here. Let's leave, Sugheili. Let's leave this shitty town. Where to? Wherever, dammit! Let's go to Tecomitl, Ozumba... It doesn't matter. Let's just leave! How? Listen. I'll get some money so Paestrudo's uncle gets me a job at the Electricity Commission. I'll make some serious money! We'll be well off! Just the two of us. Just let me in, OK? -Jump in. -Yeah? OK. Be careful. Which one's Tona and which one's Xitla? This one's Tonatiuh and that one's Xitlali. -This one? -Yes. You should take them... to the canal, so they can swim in it for a bit. No way! They would die. Why? The canal is too polluted. They can only live here now. Hey, Manganas. Ask Néstor if the revoltijo is there yet. As soon as we bury him, we'll go there. Yes, ma'am. Did you know the deceased? Alright. Did you know the deceased? Of course! We were friends with Cuácuaro. We were in the same class in school 106, group E. -Right? -Yeah. Here... -Here you are! -Hey. -Have you met Planchado? -Yes. You dated Pitirijas' sister, no? This dude has dated everybody! He has dated Kalusha, Titinga, Wendy! With your mom! -Shut up. -Cut this bullshit. Cut the shit and tell him about the job. -To him? -Yeah, we can trust this dude. He's the shit. For real. -He'll tell you. -Come here. Moloteco, bring some more. This fucker spilled it all over. Listen, man, the thing is Cuácuaro and I had planned a scam for tonight. But as you can see... he won't make it. I need someone to help me out. And Churrizo is a fucking coward. -Check your Whats. -I have no data. Hey, come over here. -Sorry, man. It's nothing. -Yeah, it's OK. What's the deal? I'm screwing this chick from San Juan, and she has this amazing shop. The other day, I stole the keys from her. Her shop is doing great! It has great profit! She's so talented! She makes shitloads of money! I want to go tonight and see what we can take. But I need someone to help me. What do you think? He wants us to do some job, tonight in San Juan. How much are we getting from this? Well... Twenty grand each, no problem. -So? -Alright. -We're in. -Damn right! But we have one condition, right? Yes, one condition. What is it? We want you to tell us -how you get so much pussy. -Yeah. -Yeah. -You want that? Yeah! -Alright. -Done. Why? Don't take him yet! Why my son? Fucking Cuácuaro, he's so fucked. Yeah. Ignore them. And don't buy them shit. You'll see, they'll follow you around like idiots. -That's it? -Fuck yeah! It's even easier if you want a Chicuarota! Toss a stale bread at her, and she'll be yours. Wait, wait. If they pull us over, I'm teaching you to drive. Cool! What's up? Do you get mad if someone calls you a Chicuarote? Folks from Tulye are Tulyecas. Those from San Juan: Barjoletas. Folks from Milpa Alta: Milpanecos. You are a fucking zoo! What are you, asshole? I'm from Aguascalientes. Hot water springs. I'm a Thermopile. We're fucking great! -Keep a watch! -OK. FUCKING SCUMBAGS, IT'S OVER FOR YOU! CHILLAMIL IS THE BOSS NOW FUCK OFF -Turn it off, fucker! -Damn! Damn! Look at all of these panties! She makes tons off them. Fuck! Damn! Maybe she hid it somewhere else. -Somewhere else? Fuck off! -Yeah... I can't find anything! Wait, dude. You heard that? No, man! You're crazy! Nah. This bitch hides the money from her man, to keep it all for herself. She didn't leave anything today. Whatever. We're fucked. Let's go. No way, dude! We're here already, let's take something! What the fuck do you want to take? -Fuck it, man! -You're fucking kidding. Be quiet! Hurry up, man! -Go! -Dammit! Damn, man! You're such a lowlife! Just go! Let's see... Go! Pull over next to the junior high to sell the panties. We'll wait until morning. Keep them, what the fuck do I want them for? As you wish, more for us! -Yes. -You just don't see it, right? If you keep doing this shit, you'll always be the same lowlife! You must think big! -Holy shit! -We're fucked! Keep it cool, dude. Take it easy. -We're screwed. -No, man. If they ask you if you had something to drink, deny it. Don't be stupid. -Let me do the talking, OK? -Yes. You don't say a fucking word! Not a single word! Don't say anything, man! What have you got? Nothing, I... I'm teaching them to drive. Look, these fuckers are either faggots or morons who robbed a panty shop. I think they robbed Popotina's shop. You're so fucked. That's three years in jail. You'll get fucked really nicely. You moron, get out. -Get out, moron! -Coming! No way! Are you Planchado? Do you remember him? We were in the same high school! True! Fucking Planchado! Do you remember us? We're the Cameroonians! Of course, the Cameroonians! Yeah... You have no fucking idea, do you? I know how you will remember, asshole. On Saint Valentine's Day, we sent you a letter... where we asked you out. You showed our letter to the whole school. You said we were some ugly, dark-skinned bitches, and that we look like we came from Cameroon. You said you rather fuck a cow than fuck us. Do you remember now? Well, that was a long time ago. -I was a stupid kid. -Right. I didn't know what I was doing. Shut up! And now you do? Oh, Planchado, I can't believe we ran into you here. You robbed Popotina's shop, right? Fucking answer. Yeah. They're nice. Why don't you take some? I bet you'd look good in them. Pass me some, dude. Just check them out... These fit you perfectly! Beautiful! It compliments your figure! Doesn't it? I mean! It does! Doesn't it, guys? It does! It does! Yes! Hey, wait a sec! Pass another one, bro. Well done. Just check this out! Damn! Passion red! Come closer. Perfect. Look at you! This is more you. You know what I mean? Fucking Planchado! Hey, listen. Take whatever you want... and let us go, yes? Come on, don't be mean. Alright, fucking Planchado. We'll let you go. You two, out of the car! Bring the keys! Why the keys? Because you're coming with us! It's just that I can't right now. It's that or you all go to prison. Your call. Take one for the team, Planchado. -Let's go! -Come on, dude. That's enough. Get in the car! Don't be bummed out, you'll like it, boy. You two, get the fuck out of here! Come on! Not a single word to anyone, motherfuckers. Or we'll be back to fuck you. -Now fuck off! -Yes, yes. -Shake that ass! -Now! Wait for me! Get in, babe. -Get in! -Come on... We'll fuck your brains out. Zaid! Let her go, motherfucker! Why the fuck are you fingering my sister? She wants it! Fuck you! I'll kick your fucking ass! Come closer to my sister again, and I'll cut your balls off! Run, bitch! Run! What about you, bitch? I thought he had grabbed you! What the fuck were you doing with him? It wasn't him. "It wasn't him." If I see you whoring around again, I'll tell Mom... Can I go now? No, wait. Take these. Tomorrow... you'll take these panties to school and sell them all. You hear me? Dude, these are hooker panties. Nobody will buy them. I don't care. If you don't sell them, I'll tell Mom... you're whoring around with Zaid. -Yeah. -Now go. No, wait. -Is Baturro home? -No, he is not. OK, now go. Fuck! Fuck, these are all old coins. Hey, get some Chococoyos. -With sprinkles? -Yes. -You know which ones? -Sprinkles. Go. It's not enough! Fuck! Just give us two Chococoyos and keep all of these coins. What do I want these old coins for? These Chococoyos costs 4 pesos only. Are they stale? Yes... with sprinkles. Two. Look, they even erased the best-before date. Yeah! They taste funny. We can't even afford some decent Chococoyo. We must eat the stale ones. Yeah. The world... I got it! I got it, dude! Come with me! Hide over there! Good! Move, moron! Don't let him see your face! Come, don't cry! Come back, asshole! Let me go! Keep walking! Keep walking, I said! Where are you? Keep walking! Easy, kid. I won't hurt you. Open! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Please! Do you really want to keep working in buses? Or eating stale Chococoyos? -Let me go! -Or sleeping in this shitty room? Open! Shut up! Open up! -Shut up! -Please! No! Let me go! Stop! -What about my Dad's beer? -Shut up! -Shut up! -He'll kill me! Dude, stay with him all night. Tomorrow, I'll get the money for him, and that's it. We'll never come back to this shit hole town. Shut up! Do not let him see you! Please! This is the thing: it's either him or us. We have no choice. Do you understand? What do you say? -Let me go! Let me go! -Shut up! Enough! Enough! -Help me! -Shut up! Stupid dog! Get out! Get out! YOUR SON WAS KIDNAPED WE WANT A 50 GRANDS RANSOM OR HE DIE LEAVE THE MONEY AT... You come up with some fucked up ideas. You son of a bitch! Will you tell anyone, asshole? Will you rat me out? Tell me now or you're dead! Will you rat me out? We won't hurt him. They give us the money, we let him go. You'll never see me again. Who is he? The... The butcher's kid. Fuck off! Do you know what you'll get if they catch you? At least 60 years! If they catch me... I really thought you couldn't get any more stupid! I'll be stupid, but I'm the one leaving this town. I do have the guts! OK, dude... What should I write? He can leave the money in the traffic light. No, if I help you, I become an accomplice. I'll end up in jail too. No. Help me out, asshole, or I swear that before I leave, I'll tell Mom about your dirty little secret! -What? -Just look at them! "Hot Gay," "Moncho." Just look at these! That one is dope. I saw it. Güily also knows about it. You pretend to be reading Ruvalcaba's book, el Hilito de Sangre. My ass! We all know you're jerking off to some big-ass cocks. If we haven't told anyone, it's because we feel sorry for you. So... Are you gonna help me? Come on, dude! Help me out! Let me see. Here. It's ransom with S, not Z. Exactly, write it. What's up, Cagalera! Yes, please, I need you to tell me. Alright, bye. Yes? Yes, I don't know... Poor thing. I called them already and they haven't seen him. Yes... And then? What else can I do? Tell me what to do. I could call Chillamil. Chillamil, Coyota's son! No, he was released from jail last week. And what should I do? I know he's a murderer, but what else can I do? No, I'll handle it! Bye! Yes, honey? What do you know? Why do you ask me? I know nothing! If I had that prick in front of me... I swear, I'd beat him up! Fuck off, Demóstenes! Open up already! -What's up? -Hi. -Are you hungry? -Yes. Come on, eat this! You don't want to? Well in that case, go hungry then! It's done, man. We'll leave tomorrow. They'll give us the money around 6:00 p.m. Nobody peeps here, right? Sugheili and I are leaving this fucking place. We've decided it. You and Sugheili? -Yes. -Sugheili and you? Yes! I mean... And you too, man, if you want to, I mean... Don't you gobble up the other one! Save it for the kid. He might get hungry later. Don't let him see you. I already made an appointment with the doctor. Oh, Dulce! -You really don't get it. -Why not? We've talked about this, I told you not to go with that doctor. But I really want to! No! Sugheili is working right now. -Leave her alone. -Hey, watch it, brat! I'm sorry, ma'am! Sugheili, be careful, dear. Let her go. I'll just tell her one thing. She'll be back. -She's finished. -Alright then. When you come back, you finish cleaning back there. Don't take long. Bring back some peanuts for me. Thank you, Dulce. I won't take long. Dulce? Karina? Bye, Melesio and bye... How was it? -Arcadio? -My name is Karina! My name is Karina! Say hi to your brother for me! He's on to you! What about you? Shut up! I want to go home already! When we let you go... will you tell anyone about me? If you tell anyone about me, we won't be able to let you go. Will you tell on me? Really? Swear on your mom? Say this: -"Let my mom die if I rat." -Let my mom die if I rat. I'm taking this off you so you're more comfortable. OK? But you already swore on it, huh! What is it? A gift. We're leaving tomorrow. Have everything ready for around 6:00 p.m. I'll pick you up. Listen, I'll get some money tomorrow. We'll get a little room with that money. And then I'll get the job I told you about. I don't know. How come you don't know? What other asshole has offered to take you with him? Who? It's just too soon, isn't it? My dad got sick again. He needs help reconstructing the store. And I have to find someone to take care of the axolotls. Cagalera! Don't show off before the starved men! You'll eat her up. Don't tell me you get shy if I look? Just watching you is turning me on! Hey. Scoot over. Have you seen a foreigner around here? Any stranger? Outsiders? Nah, why? His son was kidnapped. He just got a ransom note. No. -No what? -I don't know. And you, honey? -What do you got there? -Nothing. Let me see. And the tit sack? You couldn't afford the whole set! You're so screwed. Damn, Cagalera! Don't be stupid. If you find out anything, let us know. -We'll be around. -OK. Let's see if the hobo knows anything. Hey! Wake up! Damn! Let's go, this dude is fucked. Tomorrow after six. Don't tell anybody. After six. I know! Do you like clowns? And what do you like to eat? Chococoyos with chocolate chips! You're going to wait for me. I'll go for a clown and food. I won't take long. You'll be quiet, alright? As a tomb? Swear it? Cross your heart. I won't take long. Be quiet! You already swore it. Be right back. God dammit. Damn, Baturro! A hot brick won't bring your liver's swelling down. Just stop drinking that much, man! I'm as fit as a fifteen year-old, assholes! I've used them since I was a kid to prevent hangovers. That's right, you fuckers! Read'em and weep. Let's see. Don't try to fool us! Check it, dude! Fucking Turrunero. I'll bet you 500. A celery drink. I've never done it and I'd never do it again! Cheers! -One more? -Sure. -Got any money? -Lend me some! Damn, man. I already bought pulque for you! But pay me, OK? Don't fuck around! -Come on, Baturro, your share. -Yes, don't play the fool. Pay! When have I owed you anything? UNITED NEIGHBORS AGAINST DELINQUENCY I can't find the electricity bill. Hasn't it arrived? I haven't seen it. I think it hasn't even arrived, Dulce. Only people who don't know you will believe that, man. -If you want to play, pitch in. -Yeah, pitch something. Fifty pesos... You idiots! I roll in money. Fucking hobos! So you're the man, no? You feel like the man, right? Kind of... Fucking parasite! You steal my gun. And you have the balls to come drink in front of your father, you cynical bastard. What flavor would you like? I'm going to buy you some pulque so you stop nagging me. Son of a bitch! That's the money I hid in the cabinet, isn't it? No. No way! To lie and steal from your father... Have you no shame? This is my money. I earned it. What the fuck could you earn? Come on, give it back. No. -Come on, fucker. -No, Baturro, enough. Loan me 500 pesos. Just 500, I'll pay you later. I'll give you 200. No! Give it to me! Leave him alone, Baturro! Yeah, right, you earned it, asshole! Who do you think you are? Life's an opportunity. Take it! Life is beauty. Admire it. Life is joy. Savor it. Life is a dream. Make it come true. My God! Son, what happened? What happened? Get up! Go get a bottle of alcohol and some gauze pads! Mom, there's no alcohol left. Then bring me the spirits we brought from Puebla. Let me see, my son. Where is it? In the back drawer. -What happened, my son? -Baturro. It was Baturro. This has gone too far. Too far. Hello there! I am Cuacheque the Clown. What's your name? Arsenio. Hi, Arsenio. Look, I brought you a present. I'm crying too! I'll eat a Chococoyo to stop crying. Here, have one yourself. That one wasn't for you to eat. It was for you to rub it on you. Here, this is for eating. -What are you doing? -I'll be right back. Get out! God help us. That fucking bastard... -I'll be right back! -OK. Hey! I was watching it! We were just playing. It's a game! Nothing happened. Right, Moloteco? Tell him, Moloteco! No. It was a game. And now it's over. But it was a secret game and you can't tell anybody. But you already won! You won! Alright! Go home! Hurry! Go home! But don't tell anyone! It's a secret! You must leave town. Tell Cagalera I'm not leaving with him. He shouldn't even look for me! -What the fuck are you doing here? -He's gone. Fuck off! Dammit, Moloteco! Fuck! -Fuck this shit! -We must leave, Cagalera. Hold on! How the fuck did he leave? Sugheili let him go. She told me you shouldn't look for her. And how did she find out? What the fuck, dude? Tell me! We were about to get the money! Goddammit! We have to go. Did he see you? Did the kid see you? -No. -Goddammit! They must be looking for us already. -Who? What's going on? -Shut up! Baturro said he left some money here in the cabinet. Fuck! We're definitively screwed now! Dammit! Wow! That is good money! Did you kidnap the butcher's son? Moloteco, tidy that. I'll pack things. -Are you fucking retarded? -Shut up and help Moloteco! What did you do to the kid? Where is he? I'm talking to you, you idiot! What the hell? You fucking son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing here? You're looking for my money, right? -You are robbing me! -No. Fucking plague! Let's see if you die from it! Get out of here! Fuck off! I hope they didn't take my money. -Where's my money, motherfucker? -I don't know. Leave me alone! You two are a fucking plague! Die motherfuckers! -Mom! -Die! You useless piece of shit! You're useless! A plague! Die! Die! To think you were just a little sperm! I should have jerked you off! Let him go! Come on, you animal! Get up, boy. Here, lock on the outside. Take your brothers and don't come back until tomorrow. -Yes. -I'll be alright. I feel like shit, dude. Moloteco! Where are you, man? Don't leave me here! No, I'm here. I won't leave you. Cagalera, don't you want us to take you with Dr. Reyes? No, we have to leave right away. But you can't even see! What if you're poisoned? Never mind. I'll go get some milk. It'll make you feel better. Be right back. Come here. Why did you let her cut him loose? Everything was going to be fucking cool. Everything was going to be fucking cool, dude! Cagalera. -What happened, dude? -Don't go home right now. -Why? -Don't go. Mom asked to be locked up with Baturro. She will get him drunk all night. She wants you to open the door in the morning. This is Mr. Jesús Laurencio, Xolalpa Carbajal... asking the people of San Gregorio to come to the central square. My boy turned up. God be praised! That's the butcher. This is Mr. Jesús Laurencio, Xolalpa Carbajal... asking the people of San Gregorio to come to the central square. What are kids? Fucking parasites. Leeches! Sucking one dry to the last penny, I'd be better off on my own. Fucking kids, parasites. Fucking bloodsuckers. Sucking one dry to the last penny. No. I'd be better off on my own! If at least I had a broad like this one! But all I have is you, you fucking ugly mule. When I first met her... ...and I used to pick up artists all the time. I met... Comanche! That bastard, Comanche! He even knew me by name. Baturro, what have you become now? Olga had shows at the Blanquita all the time. While she was playing her violin. This fucking milk tastes like shit! Here. It must be expired. Damn Cuata! She sold me bad milk again. You idiot! Can't you see how bad I am? Fuck you! I don't know why I even try to help you! Asshole! I'll spend the night at Yadira's. Prick! -Güily! -What is it? -Don't tell anybody about us. -See you. As soon as we see the street is clear, we run to the sports center. Yes. You don't have anywhere to stay, do you? You've lived here all your life and you don't have a single friend. I know, man! Go with Karina and Dulce. Those dudes have the hots for you. I'm talking to you, you fucking fag! Yeah, man. I'm a fag, so what? I rather be a fag than a fucking idiot like you. You're an idiot and you'll always be. Stop it. You could go to China and still be a fucking ignorant, savage! -You'll never lose that! -Shut up. Hell no! I'm not shutting up! -Shut up, man! -Here's Cagalera! This asshole kidnapped... Look, here's the princess! What have you done to your bro? What was he saying? -Nothing. -Let's go to the square. No, Chillamil, I feel terrible. That's nothing, princess. Come on! We have to gather a lot of people. The butcher's kid is a bit out of it, but as soon as he tells us who kidnapped him, we're going to find the motherfucker and he'll be hanged! Nah, I'm really fucked! I won't even be able to help. But this will be the best of all, man! A lot of people is gathering already. And nobody will help the fucker. Who's gonna want to defend the motherfucker who kidnapped a kid? Not even the police! Come on! No, the thing is Cagalera isn't feeling well. I'm taking him to the clinic in Xochi to... You fuckers do come up with all sorts of excuses! Come on! To the square! Hurry! Fuck! What's that smell on you? Come on, walk, you clown! Help me, honey! Help me! I'm dying! Take me to Dr. Reyes. I puked blood! -Calm down, Baturro! -I puked blood! Calm down. -I love you! -Easy! Easy, Baturro. Easy, Baturro. Everything will be alright. Calm down. That's right. Alright... Over there. Careful! -Come on, idiot! -What's up? Get up now! What's up, dude, Cagalera? -It was you, fucker! -Wait, Manganas. -You, you! -Easy, Manganas. Walk! Keep walking. come on. Let them pass, assholes! -Come on! -Let them pass. Give us some space, queens! Get out of the way! Come on. Silence! Silence! It's not powering up. Damn! It doesn't get power from over there either? No. -So, let's leave it like that. -What's the point in having it off? Connect it to the street lamps. Move it! I did another round and only found these bastards. These and that one. Pay attention to what we're going to do to my son's kidnapper. If you continue down the wrong path, someday it will be you tied up on the flagpole... Gutted alive! I'm doing this for you, the misguided youth in this town, so you'll learn to stay on the straight and narrow. Did you hear me? Understood? It's working! -Bring on the cowards. -Alright! Son! My son! Eat some bread, son, to chase the scare away. Come on. But you must tell me who kidnapped you, OK? I bet it was one of those chiquihuiteros from up on the hill, right? Tell us who was it. Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to you. I bet it was those crazy chicks from El Cacalote! We didn't do it! We spend all day working our asses off already! When would we make time to kidnap kids? It wasn't us! He's a dick and he likes kids! He's a pervert! Everyone, shut up! Now I really need you to tell me who was it. Who did it? I'll get angry and I'll punish you. Tell me... Tell me. Tell me who was it, boy. Who was it, boy? Who was it? We'll find out who was it. -It was someone from up the hill! -I told you, didn't I? I told you it was someone from up the hill! -I'm telling you! -Let's grab all the chiquihuiteros we can! And bring them here for my son to spot them. And if he doesn't, we'll make them confess! Everything is known up hill anyway! Let's go get them up hill! Let's go grab those motherfuckers! Let's go grab those chiquihuiteros! Let's go to the hill! Let's go! -To the hill! -To the hill! -To the hill! -To the hill! You have no idea how tasty the revoltijo is coming up. You'll see, Baturro... Your wake will be even bigger than that for Aleluyo. There will be more food, more drink... And the rosaries will be lovely. Die already, Evaristo. Die already. Don't suffer anymore. Just die, my dear. You didn't even kiss me... But I hold no grudge. I'll miss you a lot! Navajito! Go that way! Go there! Those fucking chiquihuiteros! -Villeras! -Yes, boss? Go up La Soldada in case someone tries to make a break towards Tehutli. Sure! Princess, you come with me, and bring the sissy with you. Because the chicks up the hill are wild, and I do feel bad about breaking a chick's nose. Come with me. Maybe the people from that show Lawless City will come to film, like they did when we caught the bastard who tried to steal the Virgin from the church. I think your old man was on TV, right, Cagalera? Yes, Baturro was on TV. Yes, but he was naked. That dude! I hope we'll all be on the show again, just to piss those fucking chiquihuiteros off. Come here! This way! They thought themselves so important, because that cunt from Channel 11 came to film them once. You know, the stuck-up bitch who interviews lowlife fuckers only. Come here! Just listen. Just listen to all that fucking chaos! All because of your stupidity! Come... Come here, princess. Come here. Come. Get undressed, princess. Come on! Hurry up! Dawn will break soon. Dammit! Hold her down, assholes! Hold her down! Not you! You'll get cravings, fag. Stand up there and whistle if anyone comes. Hold up, Chillamil, what are you talking about? What's up! Do you want me to tell everyone? Should I tell everyone it was you? What did we do? Come on, fucker! Don't play the fool! Either you hold her down or I call the butcher for him to fillet your balls. Your call, princess! Come on! It'll be a quickie! No! Hold her still, I don't want to beat the shit out of her. OK. Hold her. Hold her tight! I don't wanna have to beat her. But she had nothing to do with this! -Shut up, asshole! -It was them! Shut up, dammit! You shouldn't have let him go. All of this is your fault. -No! -Get this done and we'll leave. And we'll never come back, I swear. No! No! She'll be begging later for me to fuck her again. But I won't. Hurry before I go limp. Close your eyes. What are you looking at? Don't look at me, you perverts! I don't want to see your faces. Fuck this damn crooked bitch. Hold her still, don't let her squirm. What's up? -Here's Chillamil! -Shut up, dude! Shut up, you fucker! Come here, asshole! No, here! Shut up, asshole! Come here! Son of a...! Son of a...! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck the two of you, fucking sissies! You'll try to battle it out, won't you? You idiots! Goddammit! We're going to get you! Go fuck yourself! Fuck you! You assholes! No! No! Please stop it! No! No! No! Let go, man. Let me go, dude. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, man! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -I gotta go. -Let's go! -I gotta go, man. -Let's go, Cagalera! Come on, Cagalera! Let's go! They are over there! Let's go get them! The good Lord took him. Cry. Cry, my child. Don't hold back your tears. But smile, dammit! So... where would you like to go? Wherever you want. Mazatlán, Acapulco, Tijuana... We can do whatever we want. Nobody will fuck with us now. I got it! Let's go to Vegas. Or fuck off, fucking Sugheili. Let's fuck off. -Thanks for watching- TEAM GAKKGAKK
