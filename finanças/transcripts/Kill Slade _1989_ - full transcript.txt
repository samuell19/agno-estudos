Major? Do you know this man, Major? No. He's Lester Goldblum, an American press photographer. Where was he? Should never have trusted your men with security, Captain. From now on, my men are in charge of security. Put this in the back of the truck. You clean up that mess. Slade, Slade, Slade! Seven, eight, nine, go! OK, all right. All right. Set 'em up, Joe. Slade. Slade, Slade, Slade, Slade, Slade. Good local wines, but there is a white. 20, 40, go! JJ. Sorry. I was thinking about my article. - Yes, your article. How is your investigation coming along? It's going well. I haven't got anything on paper and my editor is threatening to pull me out if I don't submit something soon. You know, it's possible that this graft is not as big as you would suspect. And that the food program is legitimate. The program's legit. But the graft is even more involved than I originally thought. Do you have, evidence of this? - As we speak. My photographer is getting it now. Really? You know, I'm very concerned about you. If this is as big as you think it is, you must be careful. You could be in danger. Would you excuse me? Of course. - Thank you. 60, 70, 80, 90, go! Hey, can't win 'em all. How 'bout it, honey? How could you possibly turn down a chance like this? Very easily. Well, I'm not a pushy kind of guy. I'll settle for a few where-you-froms, what-do-you-dos. Name's Slade. What's yours? Is he bothering you? - No, he's boring me. I should've known you were with your daddy. Hey, I like your doily there, pops. - What the hell are you guys doing? Don't you know who you think I am? Hey, wait a minute, I always and you guys. Hey, you can't do this! My ex is a personal acquaintance. Whatever. I'm sorry, JJ. I've just got to get something soon. You know what this is doing to my schedule. Tomorrow, I promise you. - Tomorrow. Always tomorrow. I can't wait any longer. I know, Bob. I'm asking you to have faith in me. I haven't got anything unless I have the photographs. I was supposed to get them today. - I'm not being unreasonable, JJ. You know that. It's just that... I'm sorry, Bob, there's somebody at the door. Hopefully, it's Lester with the shots. I'll call you back. JJ? Who is it? - Police. Open up, please. You're Ms. Jamison? - Yes, what is it? We're police. Can we come in? I've been in touch with the embassy there. They're making arrangements to have the body flown home. Yes, I've spoken with the embassy. - Maybe you should just go down there. See if there's anything they need. Well, I have an appointment with a Mr. Donaldson... Donovan... I don't know... At 11 o'clock. Good. And, hey, listen, I know it's tough, but just hang in there. I'll be all right. Thanks. I just can't believe it. We've been through so much together. Thanks. I just don't buy he got mugged. He was onto something. You've told the police this? - No. I'm not sure who's involved. I don't know who I can trust. No, one doesn't know who one's friends are these days. Now, I have some business to attend to. So why don't you put your feet up and relax? Here's a cushion for you. - OK, just... just for a little bit. Here, make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. I'll be back in a very short while. - OK. Flannigan, come. - Now this is goddamn serious. Something's got to be done about her. - Keep your voice down. She's here. She was all the way to the embassy, so I had to give her something... The embassy? Exactly. All right. Look at this. Well, Mr. Flannigan, what do you suggest? Kill her? She's too damn close. And it doesn't help that... That has nothing to do with it. Well, I should bloody well think it has. Don't think, Mr. Flannigan. It will get you nowhere. Well? Do we kill her? Yes, in a manner of speaking. A manner of speaking. Well, we can't get rid of her as easily as we did the photographer. She's far too prominent. But I might have a way. I'm sure you do, Mr. Flannigan. What about that military contact of yours... what's his name? Major Bayela. No, I can't involved Bayela at this stage. But I know someone else. Bit of a sorry character, but he'll do. Name of Slade. Aw, shit. How far have you gone with your investigation of the food aid flood? Progress is very slow, Mr. President. I want this cleared, Victor. These things take time, sir. We do not have the time. That the United Nations has chosen Congella as one of distribution points is quite an honor and we need the foreign capital. I'm aware of that, sir. You see, a scandal like this could jeopardize all that. We must put a stop to this, Victor... Quickly and quietly. That may not be possible, sir. How so? There's a woman... an American reporter. She has stumbled onto the story. Journalists tend to make a lot of noise. It's their business. You mean she can expose the fraud before we take action? We must give this matter serious thought, Victor. Good day, dear Slade. Well, look what crawled out from under a rock. Let me guess, you were just in the neighborhood, Flannigan? Brought you a present. Stolen no doubt. Woo, 12 years old. You really went all out. What's the occasion? I, got a little proposition for you. I'm not that kind of guy, Flannigan. I got you a cup, but I'm a little low on ice. How are you on cash? I'm listening. Yes. Yes, yes, I understand. No. No, no, my friend. That is not the way I do business. No, absolutely not. No. JJ, did you sleep well? - Yeah. How long was I sleeping? It's just before 11:00. 11:00? Shit, I'm supposed to be at the embassy. The embassy, of course. Now, do you have all the papers you're going to require? No, the papers are at the hotel. I've got to go to the hotel first and then I've got to go to the embassy. Look, can I drive you there? At least let me walk you to your car. That's all right, Mannie. I can manage. Thank you. Here's the ransom note. And no one gets hurt? We keep her out of circulation for a few days till you got the nod from me. What about this broadcast? I mean, how am I gonna do that? First broadcast... side A... Second broadcast... side B. Brilliant, you see how fast I catch on? $100,000... 100 grand. What is this guy, nuts? He's a very generous man. And after the death of the photographer, he's concerned for her well-being. Sounds to me like he's more concerned about his well-being. Well, unlike you, Slade, he's a gentleman. Here's $20,000. Consider it a down payment on your services. Probably counterfeit. I haven't said yes. I get the feeling that something's coming on and it feels so strong that it must be love. When I look at you, I see someone new but you never show that it must be love. You can love someone to share your dreams. Why don't you call me? Call me. Just you, honey. Looking for someone... someone... To share your dreams. Why don't you call me? Call me. I'll set you free. Do-do-do-do. Do-do-do-do. Do-do. No one was supposed to get hurt. I'm going to get a goddamn hernia. Easy does it. Nothing to it but to do it. You know the place. We know the place. I still think it's crazy. Let me give you a vehicle and a driver. No, it's not our way. We'll be dead before sunset. As you wish. Good day, sir. Good day. Do you know if Ms. Jamison's in? Let me see, sir. Yes, there's her Jeep over there. So it is. Ha, looks like she's got a parking ticket. Good Lord, no, sir. This is a hotel. Hang on a sec. I say, sir, look at this. I think we should call the police. Yes, Commissioner. Hold the line, please. Mavis, get me Major Bayela here immediately. Thank you. Excuse me, Commissioner, please continue. And you think the CRM is involved in this? I see. Look, I'll get Major Bayela on to this. And, listen, I don't want a word of this to leak out. Good. Thank you. Let's go outside. They have kidnapped the American woman, Victor. JJ Jamison? Damn it! There is a note claiming resistant movement involvement. Possibly. Or it could be a smokescreen. Could be. I want you to take charge, Victor. Her people back home must know what we're doing and they probably know much more than we do. My god, the ramifications. Look, I want you to do what you have to. Yes, sir. OK, I want you to know you're in no danger. I'm not gonna harm ya. Just gonna keep you out of trouble for a while. And I consider this your own personal tour of the bush, all right? I'm gonna set you down. What are you... - Relax now. Come on, Come on, relax... - Who are you? I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not going to harm you. I want you to stand up. Come on. - What are you... Stand up, stand up. Lady, you're making this harder than it has to be. Now, I want you to sit down, all right? Now, relax. Relax. All right. I can't see anything. You can't see because you have a blindfold on. That's why they call it a blindfold, all right? Now, is that better? I still can't see. Look, I'm not a kidnapper. I want you to understand... I still can't see anything. What are you talking about? What have you done to me? I can't see. Wait a second. Let me get a torch. A torch? What are you talking about? A flashlight, lady. What have you done? Where are you? This is not what I had in mind. What did you have in mind? Look, I know what the problem is and it's only temporary. We're going to be able to fix this. You... you gotta trust me. Come in. Well, how did it go? Fine. I made as much noise as I could at the hotel, but the police seem to have clamped a lid on it... Tight. Nothing in here. Relax. After Slade's radio announcement, tomorrow's edition will be full of it. Now, I'm meeting the hunting dogs at the camp. We'll wait for the broadcasts, then go in and say goodbye to Mr. Slade and Ms. Jamison. The hunting dogs. Do you think... They're good men. Yes, but are they good enough? I think I'd better be going if I'm going to make it in time. For a moment, I thought you hadn't made it. I've been here many hours. It's just over that bridge... About two miles. Yes, we have seen it. It's going to be a while yet. Get some rest. Do this often, Slade? Girl turns you down at a bar so you kidnap her? You never turned me down. I left. Yeah, well, I wish you'd have left me alone. Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, a beer maybe? Yeah, how about my eyesight back? I guess that means no? You know, you're an arrogant son of a bitch. How dare you make light of this? This is serious. Look, I said was sorry, all right? I never intended... - Sorry doesn't get it, pal. And all your good intentions don't mean shit now. If you think you're going to get away with this scot-free, you're wrong. People know who I am and they'll track you down. You can be sure of that. All right, you made your point. Like hell I have. I haven't even begun yet. You can't do this to me. I can't even see the hand in front of my face. Look, I told you we're going to take care of that. Didn't I? You know how much I can sue you for? I can sue you for everything you own. When I'm done with you, you're not going to have a pot left pee in. And let me tell you something else, Mr. Slade... I'm all ears. Enlighten me. You disgusting pig. You're an animal. I cannot believe... You can't, you know. Can't what? You can't sue me. And why not? Because this is Africa. Things are different here. Really? Well, you listen to me, Mr. Slade. I've taken about all the shit... Look, I've got to run a little errand here. And if you behave yourself, I will take these back off, lady. Attention, attention. This is Radio Free Congella, broadcasting on 557 megahertz. Here follows an important announcement. The renowned American journalist, Ms. JJ Jamison, has been apprehended by the enlightened forces of the Congella Resistance Movement. She will be brought to trial in a free people's court facing charges of American imperialism and capitalistic exploitation. More details will be released on a later communique. This is Radio Free Congella signing off. Now, if I take this off, do you promise you're going to be a good girl? Why are you... Let me try it one more time, honey. If I take this off, do you promise to behave? I seriously doubt if I was going to run away. What was that? Early Stones. Catchy tune? Good beat, easy to dance to... I'd give it about a 95. You're out of your mind. Only when I'm awake, honey. Come on, it's time for bed. Bed? No, you don't. You lay one hand on me and I'm gonna claw your eyes out. Don't flatter yourself, baby. Bed, as in sleep... shut eye. Comprende? Come on. Sleep! That's all I've been doing. Right this way. Come on, woman. Don't call me woman. Down. Would you turn around? Jesus. JJ: Shut up. Zebra tango. Zebra tango. Come in, please. Zebra tango receiving you. Over. Did you copy the communique from the CRM? Over. - Affirmative. Over. What is your state as is present? Over. We will wait until the next communique before we move out. Over. Correction, zebra tango, you'll wait until I arrive before you move. Over. You're breaking up. I can no longer copy. Zebra tango out. Zebra tango. Zebra tango, come in. Zeb... Aye! Step on it. Hey, hey. Tell you what I want to know. How long do you think you're going to keep me here? Lady, would you give your mouth a break? Please. I mean, you're not with the Congella Resistance Movement. Spoken like a true reporter. Now, you know that and I know that, but they don't know that. Can we get some sleep now? I mean, what's in it for you, Slade? The money? Money for my ransom? You know, if you weren't blind, I think I would let you go just so I could get some peace of mind. What's the payoff? It's for your own good, lady. Believe me. And I suppose it hurts you more than it hurts me. Shit. Well, if you're not going to let me sleep, I might as well make use of this time. Where are we going? We're going to let a doctor take a look at your eyes. A doctor? In the middle of nowhere? Come on, don't worry. He's a good doctor. He saved my life more than once. We go. The time is good for us. No, we wait. How long? Until he broadcasts again. Don't worry, we'll go before dawn. Move it. Move it. Step on it, Sir Jones. OK, duck down again. OK, straight ahead here. I'm gonna turn you around into a chair, OK? Sit down. Attaboy boy, girl. Attention, attention. This is Radio Free Congella, broadcasting on 557 megahertz. Mr. President, the broadcast. Here is a further communique regarding the abduction of Ms. JJ Jamison by the CRM. The American imperialist will be given a fair and honest trial. If she is found guilty, the CRM will have no hesitation in executing the prisoner. However, sources have indicated that there may be an opportunity for a bilateral trade of prisoners between the CRM and the oppressive dictatorship of the despot... President Dere. Details will be released as they become available. This is Radio Free Congella signing off. You're going to execute me? Don't be ridiculous, woman. OK. Right this way, please. Zebra tango, zebra tango. Come in. Over. Zebra tango, you are to take no action. I repeat, no... Right. Move out. We go. He going to mess everything up. Hope you're not too late. Smoke. Yes, Major. Step on it. Come on. Come on, faster. Faster! You know, every time I come here, I forget how beautiful it is. Look at that. Yeah, it's really lovely. Sorry, I forgot. I'm getting used to it. Well, we'll fix you up. Slade. What is this place? This is no hospital. No, it's not exactly a hospital. Where are you taking me, Slade? What is this? No, I'm not letting some tribal woman witch doctor touch me. Slade! - Come on, come on. Don't! It's gonna be all right. Come on. No! You're gonna have to trust me here. You all right? Turn around. Slade. Here, duck down here. Duck down. What the hell is this? Would you show a little respect? There's no one here. I could have told you that. There's no bloody Land Rover. Shit. Look, I can't understand a word you're saying. This man happens to be a manyonga. A what? What is commonly referred to as... A witch doctor. Forget it, Slade. Would you settle down? Look, I'd just as soon put my life in his hands as any Western doctor that I know. In fact, I've done so many times. Well, I'm not. Well, I don't think you have much of a choice here now, do you, honey? Unless you want to decide between him and me. You? All right, it's settled. He wants you to scoot closer so he can examine you. Son of a bitch figured it out. They've left in a hurry. Nothing is disturbed. Perhaps they heard us. They didn't hear us. Maybe he heard you. Can you track them from here? We can track them. We go. No, wait. Burn it. Burn everything. Destroy the camp. What did he say? Take two aspirin and call him in the morning. Here, he said drink this. What is it? Medicine. Says you'll have your eyesight back by tomorrow. Look, lady, if he says you'll see, I believe him. OK, you ready? Stand up, stay down. Give me your hand. Yes, sir. Flannigan! Flannigan! Flannigan. Flannigan! Flannigan! Flannigan! Major. What the bloody hell is going on here? I have orders. I couldn't wait around all day for you, Major. In any case, we were too late. Too late? They've gone. He got wind of it somehow and scampered. What the hell's going on? Flannigan. Slade, what's going on? Hold on. No, you hold on, Major. That convoy of yours is too slow. I'm not going to be weighed down by your extra baggage. I'm warning you. I heard you, Major. But it's my neck that's on the line right now. Let's go, Let's go. No problem. Let's go. Soldiers, go! Let's go, soldier. Yes, sir. So this food aid stuff, it's, some kind of racket? I don't think my photographer got killed for nothing. Well, Flannigan said you're in too much danger to be poking around. At least that much of his story makes sense. Flannigan... is he the guy that hired you? Yeah. He's also the one who's trying to kill us... him and his hunting dogs. He's got a pack of dogs? They're worse than a pack of dogs, honey... Five or six albinos. They're relentless. They never stop. How do you know they're trying to kill us? Are you kidding? They'd just as soon kill us as look at us. Well, me anyway. You they'll probably rape first. What? Very funny, Slade. No, Flannigan's not your boy. He doesn't have the kind of money to front this operation. Somebody's gotta be pulling the strings. Are we safe yet? Not till we get back to Lambaza. You're not gonna be safe till we're in your embassy. We're far enough to double back, though. You mean to tell me we've been going the wrong way all this time? Safest distance between two points is a zig-zag, lady. Shit. What's that? Radiator... it overheats. I knew I should have fixed that thing. Terrific. I'm gonna open the bonnet. The what? The hood. Hey, your eyes. It's great. You can see? How do you feel? I feel OK. The little man did his job. Yeah, what did I tell ya? I told you you could trust me, didn't I? You wanna hand that to me? I don't think so. You wanna tell me what's really going on here? I told you. Now, about that gun... You haven't told me anything, Slade. All I know is I was fine until you came along. Next thing I know, you kidnap me and you blind me. And now you tell me we're being chased by some albino German shepherds! Hunting dogs. Who are trying to kill us. For all I know, they're the good guys and you're the one I should be worried about. You know, that gun's got live ammunition. It can kill people. I don't know what your game is, Slade. But I fully intend to find out right now. What are you gonna do, shoot me? God! Terrific. You just happened to tell the albino German shepherds exactly where we are. You know, I'm the one who ought to be pissed at you. I'm hired to do a silly ass job to protect you, next thing I know, they burned down my camp. Now I'm running for my own life with dead weight tied around my neck... you. Don't give me this martyr routine, Slade. I mean, you're a paid kidnapper. Give me that. And an incompetent one at that. I don't know which is a bigger piece of shit... You or your Land Rover. Piece of shit. Well, you got your eyesight back, right? I mean, you don't need my help anymore, do you? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you little farewell gift here. I'm going to give you this piece of shit Land Rover and then you can just drive right out of my life. How's that sound? - That'll be just fine with me. Well, the keys are in it. And the steering wheel is on this side. This is Africa. Things are different here. Why don't you get your door fixed? It's your door now. Hey, hold it. No, don't try to apologize to me. Don't worry. Piece of shit. Now... now that it's finally found you, where will you go to run to? They're all around. They're gonna need some answers. Drape up those fancy dancers caught in their game. Run, baby, run. Baby, run. Even though the hounds are on your trail. Run, baby, run. Baby, run. You're free today and you can't fail to deliver. Wanna clean yourself up? Thanks. Get away. Into the smoke, in the world. Run, baby, run. Baby, run. Even though the hounds are on your trail. Run, baby, run. Baby run. You all right? Gotta get this steering fixed. I think you could use some sleep. I didn't sleep too much last night, did I? Run baby, run. Baby, run. Run, baby, run. Whoa, whoa. Stop... stop, you idiot. Go back, go back, go back. He went that way. Go back, go back! We've got to take a break. We go. I have to rest. You can rest. We go. You stay. You go nowhere unless I say so. Even Slade must rest. Whoa. Stop, stop! Down there. Forward. You fool! I said forward. Flannigan. Major. You should have waited. For what? So what have you gained? You will get nowhere chasing him in blind pursuit. I have a plan of action and you will cooperate. This stuff's pretty good. What is it? Can't tell you. Why, is it something disgusting? No, not at all. Is it rattlesnake? Nope. Don't have rattlesnakes in Africa. What do you have, besides misguided cowboys on missions of mercy? We got red-eyed crocodiles that love to prey on idealistic journalists. Not to, change the subject, but do you have a strategy here or are you just winging it? 100% winging it. Great. Come here, I'll show ya. OK, this is Lambaza, right? Over here is where my camp is. Or... well, at least it was. Anyway, when we saw Flannigan, we took this... Took this road here. And then we went across the bush and I suspect that we are about here. We are exactly here. The way he's going, Slade's headed straight for the gorge. Well, he can't cross there. No. He can either cross here or go up north. That's crazy. He wouldn't go north. But he is crazy. That's why he might just do it. Perhaps. Now, tomorrow we're going to try to get over to the river and... if I remember right... there is a ford there. Great, so we have a new car. A ford as in a bridge. And then we can get over to the flats. And we can catch a highway and we've got a clean shot all the way to Lambaza. Well, won't there be road blocks? Doesn't matter. Right, we can just go right through in our new Ford. You see this area here? Now, it doesn't show it on the map, but there just happens to be a dirt road. It'll take us from point A to point where we want to go... With a little bit of luck. With a lot of luck. Let's hope for a lot of luck. A lot of luck. Knowing Slade, he'll figure we'll figure he'll go south. So he'll wait till the last minute to go north. Unless he figures that you'll figure that we'll figure that he'll fake it. Come on, Bayela. Very funny, Flannigan. Well, I guess it's time for bed. Bed? Hey, you lay one hand on me, honey, and I will claw your eyes out. Can you spare some water? I'd like to wash up. Yeah, sure. Thought you're supposed to conserve water in the bush. Are you kidding? I could find about 20 gallons of water in 100 different plants and roots. Besides, we parked by a waterhole. It's down that way. Thanks a lot. Goddamn it, Slade! Now what? Are you all right? Turn around. You just called me. What am I turning around for? Give me back my clothes, you pervert. What are you talking about? Don't play innocent. My clothes were right there, Slade. What are you saying? That I took your clothes? Who else took them? They didn't just get up and walk away. Well, contrary to popular belief, I do not have an answer for everything. But I will look for your clothing, all right? Turn around. I'm turning. Probably some animals for all I know. I'll keep my eyes open for a warthog wearing your bra and panties. Aw. I'm turning. I'm turning. One out of two's not bad. One out of two what? Well, I couldn't find your skirt. Great. Look, I'll... I'll look in the Rover and see if I can find anything for you. Here's what we'll do. I'll go north. The hunting dogs will follow him. And you'll go to the ford. Either way, we'll have them boxed in. I don't know. I think... Don't think, Flannigan, do as you're told. Or else suffer the consequences. That's not bad. It's not too good. Come here. It won't hurt a bit. OK, turn around. Turn around. Is that better? It is for me. Here, help me up. Always knew you wanted to get into my pants. Don't flatter yourself. What is it? It's time, we go. Keep on his trail. Keep pushing him. You'll act as herders pushing them into either mine of Mr. Flannigan's net. You go. And remember... whatever happens... Make sure. We better go. JJ? JJ, wake up. it's time to go. It feels like I went to sleep about five minutes ago. More like five hours, but it'll have to do. How do you manage to wake up so early? This is Africa. Things are different here. How so? Well, the bush. It kind of sings to you like an early morning song. It tells you when to rise and shine. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't squish it, it'll lose its flavor. Flavor? You mean people eat these? I didn't hear you complaining last night. Come on. Hey, come on, these babies are full of protein. More nutrition here than crayfish and prawn and such. The secret is in how you cook them. On, let's break it up. We've got to go. I can't believe this. These guys are good. They're ugly, but they're good. Slade! Aw, shit! Don't tell me... The emergency brake. - Yeah. I knew I should have gotten that thing fixed. Shit. Well, let's see how much of this baby we can salvage. Be careful now. Are you kidding? It might explode. Only on TV, honey. And God knows how much that resembles real life. In every single episode, they got some bungling detective somehow solving every goddamn mystery, right? Commercial by commercial till you get down to the grand finale. And then you get this car chase. It always ends up in a collision. And every single collision ends up in an explosion. You know what I mean? It's ridiculous. Fact is... statistically speaking... Only about 4.6% of all car crashes involve a fire. You know? Let alone an explosion. You know what I'm talking about? So I'm... Jesus Christ! I'm sorry. You were saying statistically speaking? We better get the hell out of here. We just sign posted a direct route to our front door. Come. Smoke. You go. Think you could slow down just a little bit? Just a little bit? Just a little bit. Here. Does that help? Yeah, thanks. Don't mention it. - I won't. Slade, I quit. You quit? JJ: Yes. Hell, you're fired. Now just keep walking. Know what I think, Slade? I don't want to hear what you think. How's that? Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway. How's that? I think we're walking in circles. Yeah? Maybe we are, just to throw them off course. You ever think of that? Come on, Slade, I gotta rest. We stop now, you're gonna rest in peace. This isn't a trial run for when it counts, honey. Those guys mean business. OK, OK, I... You made your point, Mr. Bushman. Shit. Don't get too relaxed. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Faster, faster. Over there. Come on, move it. Do you have any idea where we're even going, Slade? Yeah. Where? This point in in time, we happen to be going down the hill. Now, move it. Well, what now? We're a little further north than I thought. That's great, Slade. Ford's back that way. So what are we going to do? I don't know. Hunting dogs will be on us any second, though. That's a comforting thought. No problem. Well? We go down. No. You are not Butch Cassidying me. What's the matter? Can't you swim? Slade, you can't be serious. Come on! Come on, woman, let's... Don't call me woman. You can call me whatever you want. You see over here? You see? Look. Look! Where? Here, give me that rope. You see anything, I want you to blast it. What are you doing? I'm doing my job. Would you do yours? OK. Slade. SLADE: What? I think I see something. Well, shoot it for Christ's sake. Good girl. Good girl. My ass. It's a bunch of birds. Would you get down and stay down? OK, now cover me. If you see anything, I want you to shoot it. If you hear anything, I want you to shoot it. If the wind blows, blow it away. No. What's wrong? Nothing, it's fine. Would you just keep a look out? Look, I want you to cover me, all right? Hurry up, Slade. I'll be right there. Slade! Hey, give me the gun. Give me your hand. No, Slade... Give me your hand. Now, when you get halfway down, drop. I'm not ready! Go! I'm stuck! Whoa! Holy shit! Slade? Slade! Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. Give me a hand. Put it on me. You just gotta know how to fall. OK. You just gotta relax, that's all. Woo. All right? Easy does it. If you tense up, you can snap just like a dry branch. Easy does it. That's the ticket. Where did you learn all this, Special Forces or something? No, bar fights. Should of let go earlier, you know. I couldn't. Why not? Would've landed in the water. Right. Right. What about the crocs? Crocs. Crocs? I could've gotten killed out there, Slade. Hey, come on, JJ, I knew you'd get out in time. They would've been riled up. They would have been waiting for me. I could've lost a limb or something. How could you tell me to fall? Aw, you think you could've survived that? Well, maybe I could have. Anyway you're all right, right? So cut me a little slack. I'll cut you some... Slade! Hands up, Flanny. Hands up! Bet you want your $20,000 back, JJ... get his gun. Just as well, that one's empty. Can we talk about this? Shit, I guess not. Shit. Got a little proposition for ya. Guess that means no. Goddamn it. Shit, down. Grab the gun. You OK, slugger? Did you see that move? Yeah, I suppose you learned that in bar fights. Special Forces. Come on. Yes? Mr. Mannie Kostas? Speaking. This is Major Bayela. Major Bayela. Flannigan is dead. What? Slade and the girl know about the transfer. Right. Thank you very much. Damn. Step on it, Sergeant. Let's go, guys. Yes, sir. You know what you're doing? Let me guess, 100% winging it. See how it feels? Trade you for my shirt. OK. Terrific. Gun? Scalpel? Want me to drive? Are you serious? Steering wheel's on the right. Thanks. Look at this. Slade, this is exactly where my photographer went the night he was killed. - Well, that's great. We'll tell them that at the American embassy. Next stop... Lambaza. No, next stop right here. I'm not going there. Shit. Can you believe this? I wish I had a camera. I wish you'd shut up. You want to get us killed? Well, well, well, if it isn't if your boyfriend. Don't start with me, Slade. I wouldn't think of it, honey. Hey, look, you wanted to come here. We're here. You seen enough? Come on, let's go. Damn it. Hello, Mannie. JJ. Surprised to see me? Yes. You're a very foolish girl. Should have learned to leave well alone. And now? You leave me no alternative. Hey, that's no way to treat a lady, Kostas. Mr. Slade, I presume. So you're the son of a bitch who had my camp burnt down, And had us chased all through hell and back. Mr. Slade, why don't you talk money? Yeah, why don't we? Way I got it figured, you still owe me 80 grand, but I think I'm gonna let that slide. Slade, what the hell are you doing? I didn't do anything. Isn't that the truth then? Flannigan. Where did you come from? You're not the only tough nut around, Slade. I don't get it. It's quite simple, Ms. Jamison. Kostas was a greedy bastard. Wanted me to do all his dirty work for him for a mere pittance. I've thrown my lot in with Bayela. Bayela? I thought you told me that he was... Shut up. You see, with military protection, no one can stop this venture. So Bayela's in with you, Flannigan? What side is this guy on? The winning side, Mr. Slade. Bayela. At last. Why do you have to kill him? Why? Because we're finished with him, that's why. You think he'd let us stroll in and take over his operation, dear? Wait a second, Major. Kostas fell for the phone call. Yeah, I'd say so. I have waited months to get the goods on Kostas. In one squeeze of your trigger, you undo it all. Get the goods on... Why, you double-crossing bastard. You go. You call them off, Bayela. Or you're a dead man. I don't mind being beaten fairly. But I won't be cheated. A man of principle. - Right, guys. Round them up. I'm getting lost here somewhere, Bayela. I mean, I... I don't get it. I mean, if you knew that Kostas was involved, why couldn't you just do something? I had nothing on Mr. Kostas that would stand up in a court of law. Of course, Flannigan put pressure on when he has this kind of scheme. Yeah, well, that's an understatement. Look, Bayela, you've got to understand that I was set up on the get-go. I mean, they said nobody's going to get hurt, right? I mean, do I look like a vision of health or what? Don't you think you put this away, Mr. Slade? This? Don't worry about this. It's empty. I was just bluffing. Hey, what are guys doing? JJ! Who called the press? I had to call them. I didn't anything. Hey, JJ! JJ! Hold it! Hold it. Hold it. You got the wrong man. Mr. Slade is guilty of nothing except uncovering this whole scam. Hey, wait, wait, hold it. Wait. Thank you. Should I tell them the truth? Why start now? Why start now? All right, you want the story? Here's the way it went down. Hey, Jack. JACK: Hi. Hey, do you mind if I borrow this? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Thanks. I had the game figured out but I wasn't sure who all the... Slade. Players were, right? Now what? JJ. JJ, is that you, babe? Yeah, it's a bad connection. Listen, you've got a reservation on the red eye tonight. Well, I wish you'd had told me earlier. I would have but we've had a hell of a time reaching you. Listen, you can't believe how hot this story is. And... there'll be a surprise for you when you come home. Well, I've got one for you too, Bob. What is it? I can't make it. What? Something's come up. What? You mean I can't have you? I don't understand. No, I don't think you understand, Bob. This is Africa. Things are different here. JJ? JJ! Whoa! Woo! Heading for a fall. Winner takes it all. Someone's gonna find out. That is what I wanna see. You guessed right. You guessed it, baby, you guessed it right. You're not alone, you guessed right. You guessed it, baby. You guessed it right. You'll never know you've been had. You guessed right.
