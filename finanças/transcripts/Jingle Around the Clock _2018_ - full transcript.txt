- Elle. - Elle. I had an idea for Misfit Christmas. Now, are we sure that this isn't the year where we stop calling it that? I mean, it's a Christmas party. We are grownups. Is "Misfit" really the best we can do? We could go back to calling it "The Christmas Party at the Island of Misfit Toys..." But it's a mouthful, so we shortened it. Listen to Elle, she has the best memory. Plus, "Misfit" is better than when we were calling it... "Lonely in the Dorms Christmas". Also listen to Alexis, she reminds us that we've always been terrible at naming things. Yeah. No. He hasn't been in yet. Who? Nothing. Jay, how'd your date go? My date did not go as planned. Let's just, let's just leave it at that. Did you do that thing where you mask nervousness by over-explaining things? Yes. You have to relax. You are a totally normal person in real life. Thank you, thank you, I think. Elle, let's get back to what you were talking about. Your big idea for Misfit Christmas? Do we need a bigger space? I mean, with all of the party games and the food and the carols... No, look. I appreciate it, Elle, but we're doing it here. I mean, I'll just close down for the night. - You'll lose business. - It's totally worth it. 15 of our nearest and dearest and their spouses and their kids and all of them packed in here. I sort of can't wait. - Okay, as long as you're sure. - I'm totally sure. It's coffee guy. - That's coffee guy? - It is. - Don't look. - We're already looking. - Coffee guy has seen us looking. - Well, stop looking. How long has this been going on? A few days. I think he's new to the city, but I can't tell. Do you want us to flag him down, because I can definitely... No, no, Jay. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks again. See ya. - Well, that went poorly. - It really did. What? Nothing, nothing. Should we go? Yeah. What, you guys just got here. It's Sunday. And, it is two weeks before Christmas. I spent all of November making sure my boss thinks I'm great, and getting ahead at work. Which means, in turn, I am now behind on shopping and errands and getting the party setup done, and I've got six days to... Look, every year, you throw us this Misfit Christmas Party. And every year, it's amazing. How is this year gonna be any different? Because I like to outdo myself, Ryan. Let's go, Jay. Bye. What about this? I don't think that Alexis wears perfume, does she? She's hard to shop for. Not if you listen. Always complaining her feet are cold. Right. Yeah. Yup. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Can I help you find something? I like the perfume. It's... Fiona. Your boss, Fiona? Yeah. Excuse me. Our boss, actually. We work in the same place. Hey, Fiona. Is everything okay? Not in the least, but nothing for you to worry about. It's the Century Cookware account. In my haste this morning, I accidentally added you to an email thread about it, and I just wanted to warn you to ignore it. Also, do you know how to turn the lights on, on the weekend? The switch is by the break room. What's going on? What's going on is I'm here on a Sunday, my assistant isn't answering, and... Do you need my help? My account is pretty much on autopilot for the holidays, I could drop by. No. Why should everyone's weekend be ruined? You know me, I am always willing to... Light. Got it. You enjoy your break. Ignore the emails. It's like I literally lose my mind. Do women like nervous guys? Should I just rebrand to "dashing but anxious?" Elle, are you listening? Sorry, I'm sorry. I think you're charming, Jay. Someone else out there will, too. And, it has always been my theory that when you meet her, you will be completely normal in front of her. Well, I appreciate that, thank you. But I am not taking your word for anything until you get back out there yourself. I am out there. Yeah. You saw me, I absolutely flirted with that coffee guy. Okay, another RSVP. That means everyone who still lives in Chicago is a yes for Misfit Christmas, the four of us plus Anne, Richard, Linda, Marsha, Dawn and Dan. And the others? There's a thread that everyone's on. I'm heading uptown, are you coming? I'm gonna go to work and check on Fiona, actually. You want her to put you in for that creative director position. Okay, all right. I have spent all year trying to get Fiona to notice me. All right. And listen, if you need any help with Misfit Christmas, let me know, okay? I will. Promise. - No, you won't. - I probably won't. All right, see you tomorrow. Okay, Bye. I'm so sorry. No, I was working while walking. It's a terrible habit, I just... Me too. Coffee shop. The Brewing Pot. Yes. Right. I love that place. My friend Alexis owns it. Everyone's so friendly in there. Yeah. The coffee's great. It is great, yeah. I should... Yeah, me too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'll see you at the... Yes. Yeah. Okay. What's his name? Her name? What happened? Century Cookware account. This is supposed to launch in two days. And this is the commercial launched by their top competitor, today. That is not good. Except, it is a good ad. Now ours looks like we copied it. And yet, neither of the ads have people in them. We'll figure it out. They called Maxwell Turner in. That guy who works in the New York office? Yes. He's fixed a lot of campaigns. Corporate wants him to come and help out. Fiona, I could've jumped in on this. True, I've never worked with cookware, but I could get up to speed fast. I'm local, I have... Elle, while I know you would add a lot to this, you have worked hard, and you deserve a break. But Maxwell Turner? First of all, he's terrible in email, worse on the phone. I know. Wonder what he's like in person. So, what can I do to help? It's Sunday. You go home. This is a mess, we're gonna be on it probably right up to Christmas. But I can review something. I can take a look at a mock-up, or something? This is about the creative director position. Elle, you've already proven yourself a great employee. But that job... Is a bit of a reach, I know. But, I'm ready for it. Okay. So, what would your take be? First of all, those ads just show the cookware, but it should be about how the cookware is used by actual people. And that's something you can do online, really easily. And you're offering to dive in on a job that's long hours and technically difficult, because? Because I know I can do it. And help you in the process. - And that's a bargaining skill that... - You taught me, yes. Fiona, I want to grow here. There's a brainstorming meeting tomorrow morning. Come prepared. Thank you. And, if I... I'm not promising anything yet. Bring some ideas, the interviews are this Friday. It won't be easy. But, if the partners like your ideas... Don't worry, I'm gonna nail it. Nobody should worry. Who's worried? I'm not worried. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do. But, this would mean getting to use all of my skills, not just the digital ones. Business, creative, budgeting. Yeah, plus managing people. It'd be great. Just means you won't get much time off between putting this campaign together and planning this party. I am not worried. I always get it done. I'm excited to come decorate the coffee shop with you. Yeah, me too. Hey, don't stay up too late, okay? I won't. Kay, see you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. Well. I have got a few of those, Maxwell Turner. And while I know we don't have a lot of time to come up with a new ad, the fact is, we're up against Christmas. People want to know what to give as a gift. I would say more than that, people want to make sure they're giving a quality product. Sorry, who is that speaking? Hi Maxwell, I'm Elle Bennett. Chicago office. I enjoy your emails, they are very direct and to the point. I have an idea that expands the campaign using social media and traditional... No, the social media route lets our market respond, opens us up to more criticism. The last thing we want... I think that you would be surprised at how adaptable and fast social media can be. The heart of Christmas is bringing people together and sharing moments, which is something that digital campaigns do best. So, what exactly do you propose? Because we have two days to launch. Glad you asked. So, you have a commercial that look like someone else's commercial. We don't need to shoot a new one. Just expand the idea online. I put together a mock-up of some still images. But the main idea is a series of short videos. We show a host using the cookware so it feels different and bigger than the competitor's. "Not all pots are created equal". "Century Cookware, made for real people". I like this, Elle. Max, your thoughts? Yeah, it's kind of interesting, it's a little thin, I feel like it needs something,... Guys, I'm kind of in the middle of... I, I'm gonna have to... Max? Max? Okay, so we have lost Max. Let's take an hour for lunch and come back refreshed, yes? Great job. I want you to work with Max on it. Is that going to be a problem? I'm a professional. He is also a professional. Thank you. Hi. Hello, welcome back. Ooh, so, I know that you were here just the other day, but... I'm Elle. Elle, right. And you're Nancy, right? Yes. I like the new look for your booth. Thank you. Yeah, my son said I had to get better at catching customers. Well, a little marketing never hurt. That's what he says. And, I think he's right. I've had so many more customers since that sign went up. Better than my old marketing plan. Which was? Christmas magic. Let me get your ornament. This one's for my friend Kate. She just had her first child this year. And this one? That's for my tree. I get myself one each year. Well no one's ever asked me to make a laptop ornament before, but I had a lot of fun making it. It's the only thing that I could think of that summed up my year. So you work with computers? Fingers crossed I'll be moving into a leadership role soon, but, yeah, websites, social media. My son tells me I should have a website, but I'm not convinced. They're really easy to make. Really? I mean, it would be nice to sell some more ornaments. Well, you know, you could take photos of the ornaments, make a few posts. That's what I keep telling her. You see, mom? It's you. It is me, yeah. And it's you. You two know each other. Yeah. We've seen each other around at the coffee shop and... This is the coffee shop girl. Mom. She can... you're not whispering quietly at all. I'm glad to know that you're related to Nancy. I mean, that's a... It's a coincidence. Yeah, a huge coincidence, yeah. My son is also in advertising. Yeah, he made the new sign. Where do you work? I'm based in New York. They think I'm here in our Chicago office, and the Chicago office thinks I haven't arrived yet, just so I could help Mom with the booth... It's a good strategy. Hey, we haven't... Right. I'm Elle. Elle Bennett. From... Szabo & Bezanis? Newly working on... Cookware. Yes. Wait. You're... Max Turner, aren't you? Christmas magic. So, the Chicago office thinks you're in New York, and the New York office thinks you're... Now, wait. I told you that in confidence. I don't think you did. All right, fine. But please don't blow my cover. Wait a second. I was in the office pitching you an idea that I worked hard on, and you were... I was working, and I was supposed to be off celebrating Christmas with my family. So to help mom at the booth, I... No, no, you leave me out of this. And can you two have this conversation in front of another booth, please? You're gonna be all right here by yourself? I've been working this booth for 20 years, three years by myself, so yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. You go on. Why don't you give me those bags? Are you sure? Yes, I am sure. Now, off you go. Thanks, mom. The fact is, video online can be made much faster than it can for on the air. We find a host, someone relatable. We can shoot them quickly, and... why aren't you interrupting me? I'm listening, why would I interrupt you? Well, because... that's been your thing. That's not my thing. Everyone says it's your thing. Everyone? Yes. Grouchy fixer of ad campaigns. You're very brusque in emails. I'm efficient. You interrupt people on the phone. To be fair, the phone is not a great way to do anything anymore. No, no, no I know, the phone is the worst. This is weird, right? First the coffee shop thing and now... A little. But at least we figured it out before... Yeah, right, now we can just focus on the work. Right. And look, Fiona likes your video idea. But I think it needs to be more aspirational. People want to know what kind of gifts the pros are giving. That's why I think it needs a celebrity host. I disagree. I think that a celebrity host can alienate people, make them feel like they're not a good enough cook. I'm not sure about that. You wanna bet? No. Wait, what? Sir, excuse me. Sir. If we each made a wreath, would you tell us which one is better? Yes, absolutely. I say nice things about all the wreaths people make here. But secretly, I judge. Not yours of course. You in? This isn't how decisions like this are made. We have to look at market research and focus groups. Well, if we had time, sure, but when you have too much to do and equally good plans, sometimes you just gotta wreath it up. All right. You're on. We'll go with the idea of whoever makes the best wreath according to him. Deal. Do you want me to time you? How seriously are you taking this? Very seriously. Best wreath within 20 minutes? You're one of those Christmas people, huh? Tree goes up day after Thanksgiving, you got a Christmas village you put on the mantle every year, you stay up late on Christmas Eve drinking hot cocoa and waiting for Santa and his, what do you call em, Christmas Llamas? You mean reindeer? Right, reindeer. I'm kidding, that was a... I obviously know what reindeer are. Let me guess. You are one of those "meh, just another day" types. Show up at the Christmas party dressed as a dapper Scrooge. Refuses to wear an ironic sweater. Actually, I didn't hear anything after "dapper". And those Christmas parties are great networking opportunities. Christmas parties are when you get to see a different side of people. You treat them less like a co-worker or friend, they become, I dunno, family. Yeah. That part's pretty great. That is... okay. All right. It's not that bad. Hey. Nobody said bad. You tried. That's the important thing. Okay. Fair is fair. You win. We will do a series of celebrity chef hosted videos, but we keep them relatable. Well, there we're in luck. Because Julia Wise and Rachel Richards are both in town doing press for their cookbooks. Wait, Julia Wise? I love Julia Wise. I watch her Christmas special every year. Rachel Richards is amazing. Great, I'm gonna make some calls. I'm gonna head back to work and figure out a shoot. And will you not blow my cover at work? That I'm here pretending to be there? Just because I'm helping my mom with her booth... No, I get it. "Just landed in Chicago. Meeting with Elle soon". Send. Okay. So, I'll see you soon. Yep. Kate, Hi. I can't wait to see you. This year's Misfit Christmas Party is totally coming together. Elle, that's what I'm calling you about. So it turns out Jason's family scheduled their Christmas party for Saturday, I hate to be the one that messes things up, but is there any way that we can do Friday night instead? Sure. Yeah, I'll just check in with everyone else. Elle, you don't have to do that. I'll call some people and find out. Really Kate. It's no big deal. I can't wait for you to meet the baby. But for now, I have to change her. See you soon. Kay, bye! Okay. You got this, girl. Hey. Hey! Let me help you with that. That sweater is both great and terrible. Right? My staff does this Christmas sweater day. It's nuts, but I kind of love it. I figured it was best to leave some of these here now, and then I'll bring the rest when we decorate. Decorate. But... Just like, a tad more? Okay, sure. And then... Because we've moved the party from Saturday to Friday... Elle. You don't have to do this by yourself. I know. Hey. Good morning. Hey. Is he here yet? Who? Who else? Christmas romance coffee guy turned surprise grouchy Christmas co-worker. We heard. Okay. I gotta go. Have. A good. Day. You. Too. Every year she gets herself worked up over this, and every year it's the best party ever. Yeah. Well, we all fly off to see family, or you know, have them come to us. But for Elle, we're her family. It's very... ...Elegant. It's tasteful. It's the kind of place people want to live in. Plus, it showcases the cookware. But these are holiday videos. People want colour. Life. Reality. I mean, this is like Christmas in one of those ice hotels. It's very... Sparse? Yes, I told him that too. I do a lot of entertaining here, so I keep it a little blank and I add things as I go. Hi, I'm Oakley. I'm this guy's sister. I'm Elle. Thank you so much for letting us use your space. It is beautiful. I just... Yeah, no, no, no. I get it. I know exactly what you're going for. Oak is a party planner. She's setting up the firm's Christmas party. It's gonna be so great. It's that giant space next to the ice rink downtown. I am obsessed with that place. It's got that gorgeous atrium upstairs. I admire anyone who does party planning for a living, cause, man, is it tough. Well, the key is the food. And good wine. Now, this place is gonna need decorations and colour if you're gonna shoot a Christmas video here. I like Oakley. Oakley gets it. Lead the way, Christmas expert. First thing's first. Okay, I am gonna look at the Frasier Firs, you guys take the Blue Spruce aisle, and we'll find two that match. All right, yell if you see something. Okay. It smells amazing here. Yeah, it's like getting lost in a forest. It looks like we had our first stumble. Julia Wise is out. What? I was looking forward to that. Rachel Richards is still on board, though? As of now, yeah. Okay. Here, Merry Christmas. That was nice of you. I'm not a total scrooge. I think my words were "dapper scrooge". Yeah. They were. So are your folks here in Chicago too? I was raised by my grandmother. She passed when I was in college, so since then, it's just been me. I have a tight group of friends, and every year we throw ourselves a party, exchange gifts, eat a ton. And then after that, we all scatter off for Christmas, some travel and some have folks in town, but yeah, we started it in college. You kept it going every year? The last few years have been smaller parties, cause people have moved away and started their own families, so it's harder to make work, but this year's shaping up to be big. It's cool, keeping a tradition. Yeah. What about you? You spend it with your mom and sister? And aunts and uncles and everybody, yeah. Last few years I've been helping Mom with her booth since Dad passed. Which by the way, my mom hasn't stopped talking about building her on website. We've been telling her to do it for years, but apparently meeting an expert has really changed her mind. Well, I'm happy I can put my expertise to use. Your mom's ornaments are one of my favourite Christmas traditions, so more people should know about them. Yeah. Found them. They're perfect. And we know exactly where to get the ornaments. But let's delegate that to someone else, cause we've got to get these trees back in and revise the scripts. Or we could make sure it's done right by doing it ourselves. But we don't have time. We do, if we use the time wisely. Except we're lugging these trees around. I'll help Elle, we'll grab a cab to the Christmas fair and you can take the trees back and put the lights on them. I like her more and more. All right. All right. See you with the ornaments. Yeah. See ya. Still, 20 years. That's a long time. Yup. I was practically raised in this Christmas fair. This is where I do most of my Christmas shopping every year. Yeah, for my gifts, for the party with my friends. Hey, if you ever need help with that, party planning's my thing, I could easily... I appreciate it, but I think I've got it. Or, if I don't, then my friends seem to be picking up my slack. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, just feeling a little guilty about having to juggle so many things. It all somehow gets done, it just, it would be nice to have a little more space, you know? Well, don't underestimate the power of delegating to the right people. If there's one thing I've learned, it's to know when you're doing too much. Hi, Mom. Well, look at this. A little bird told me to get you some ornaments. Tasteful ones, he said. Colourful. Something that will pop on screen. Something like this? Oh my goodness, they are perfect, Nancy. Thank you. How much do we owe you? Oh, no. No, no, no. This is on me. Nancy. I mean, at least let us pay you for... No, listen. We're decorating our tree on Wednesday, and you can pay me back by coming to Glenco to help us out. I wouldn't want to intrude. No. That word does not exist in our house. You have to come. Thank you. In that case, I insist. Let me make you a website. Okay. Oh, here. Hey, Fiona. What's up? Wanted to let you know that the partners heard about your campaign ideas for Century Cookware. They said they like the way you think, and gave you a spot on the interview list for Friday afternoon. Really? That's great. Yes, also, heads up, the interview process requires a presentation. They want you to come in prepared with something that highlights what you do best. I can do it. Good news? Just, putting more things on my list. Shall we start decorating? We shall. - See you Wednesday. - Okay. Okay. I have to admit, this is festive. It's Rachel. Hey, Rachel. Did you get the scripts we sent over? We're excited to... No, I understand, can we send something over to...? I understand. No, thank you. Rachel Richards has the flu. Oh no. So we're... ...back to square one. Well, we basically decorated your sister's place. Yeah. And no celebrity chef, so you got your way. All right, so we regroup. Maybe shoot some still photos of the cookware. I didn't know you cooked. Yeah, my mom taught me. She's always been amazing in the kitchen. She makes this green bean casserole at Christmas that's just... I mean, you'd... It's incredible. How finely can you dice? There we are. So your mom taught you how to make gourmet grilled cheese? Nah, this one's all me. Also, I have to say, this cookware is not half bad. I have their pie dish. I've always been more of a baker than a chef. Oh yeah? What's your specialty? Pecan pie. My grandma's recipe. Nice. I gotta admit, it would have been so great to see a pro in action today. So you could steal some moves for your own Elle Bennett cooking show? Yeah, something like that. Well, I guess we'll just have to figure something else out. Yeah. Okay, team. You both keep solving your own problem. I'd watch an Elle Bennett cooking show. Just do that. What? Same idea, except we have. ...no host at all. It's not a series of hosted videos, it's just real people talking, making recipes and uploading them. Like an online recipe circle. Yeah, yeah! I can make a fast web-page and then people can start posting videos and share them. And we could use a crew to film the first post, with a real person. So we get this real person... from where? Are we sure it should be me? Why not Oakley, or why not... what's your name? Because, if you'll recall, it was your idea to use someone relatable. Yes, I agree. But what if I'm terrible? We'll just tell you. I'm kidding. You're gonna be great. There's not even that many people here. Just show us all an example of someone who loves Christmas. Hi, come on up. And I am gonna call Fiona and tell her about the change. Hi. Hello. I'm here for Elle Bennett? Yeah, she, she's in the makeup chair. Right, great. Hi. I work with words, at the same place, editing scripts and... I'm Jay. Oakley, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Jay, hi. I'm so sorry, I didn't tell you that the plans have changed. Oh, no, no big deal at all. I don't know how they talked me into this. You do the videos? That's so smart, you... No, that's so smart. You're smart, you're funny, you're charming. You're gonna do great. Well, here goes nothing. Okay. You ready? Nope. Not unless you want to take my place. Nope. Hi, I'm Elle, and I am gonna teach you how to bake a pie. ...No.. That's a good first try. I'm Elle Bennett. You may have seen our ad, which looks suspiciously like... No, we're not gonna... Hey, gang? Who likes a good flaky crust? It's an option. Hi. I'm Elle. Look, you're seen a few ads for cookware this Christmas season, with rich, delicious pie filling bubbling over a flaky crust, cooling on the counter. Well, you're in for a treat, because I happen to know the recipe for just that pie. So, we're gonna start with three cups of all-purpose flour, and a quarter cup of sugar. You know, my friend Beth would make this even in the dorms which is harder than it sounds. Now, some people say that homemade is just too much work, but I say not only do you appreciate it more, but it's like everyone else can taste the effort. So, here's your personal invitation to get in on our recipe circle. Share yours here. Thank you for coming and helping with the edit. Well, there was free pie. Plus, your place is closer than the office. Reminds me of when I worked at a start-up, and there were a lot of late nights at friends' apartments. Start-ups, huh? So, how did you end up working at S&B? I guess I was looking for something a little more steady? And it's fun? But... This turned out great. The, the video or the pie? Both. Ready to upload to the server so Fiona can review it? Yes. I have to say, decorations-wise, this is just the right amount. Except for that. That's maybe one decoration too many. You know, it is scientifically proven that Christmas decorations make you happier. Oh yeah? Where was that study published? Lots of places. North Pole Journal. Elf Weekly. CNN. It really is everything but the Christmas village on the mantle. It's not technically a mantle for the Christmas village. Well, I ran out of space so I had to improvise. These, these belonged to my Grandmother. We used to always set it up together. My dad used to decorate an old sleigh in our driveway. My mom keeps up the tradition every year. I wish she could see me. My grandma. She always worried, so it would have been great if she could see me as a grown-up with a good group of friends around me, a good job. I actually just applied for the creative director position. You did? Why? Is that a reach? No, I, no... I just didn't realize they were... The video's uploaded. Okay, well, I guess we'll see what Fiona thinks. Yeah, yeah, I should let you get back to planning your party. Yeah, it's getting late. But I will see you tomorrow, because, your mom invited me to come decorate the tree and put up her social pages, so... What? No. Nothing... Good job today. You too. Fiona, hi. The video looks great. You guys did a great job. Let's get this page up as soon as we can and get people uploading theirs. You got it. I will get on that right now. And, Elle. I want to say I noticed. I know collaborating with Max was a challenge, and it looks like you figured it out. I hope the fact that you're bot in competition for the same job won't change the work you've been doing. What do you mean, what competition? Didn't you get my email? Max applied for the creative director position, too. Look at you, up and at 'em. Yeah, early bird gets the weird corporate stab in the back, I guess. There you go. What do you mean? Just work stuff. Elle, I love you. We are family. Should we just not do the party this year? What? Are you... I know that it's important, but you are really busy, and this job is big for you. We're here to support you, I just think that... No, it is nothing I can't handle. Okay, I admit, I am busier than I thought I would be. But it turns out that Max also applied for the same creative director position I'm up for. Yeah, of course he did. That's a great job. The position is here in Chicago, though. He doesn't even live here. But look, I get it. People want to grow at their jobs, it's just... Hun, it's not up to you what people do. Is this a pep talk? No, you come to me for the real talk. So here is your personal invitation to get in on our recipe circle. Hey. Here. The numbers aren't great, so far. You know, well, it takes time. They have to... I also wanted to talk to you about something. Okay, so what's the next step? Well, we are in this phase right here, where users are starting to make their own videos. And how long does that take? According to the research, it usually takes about a day to populate. This is the window where we wait. It's in process. I swear. Okay, I trust you, but the client is anxious. Foot on the gas, people. Max, can you help me with some numbers? Sure thing. I wanted to tell you that I also applied for the... I know. Max? Yep. Lunch today? What? Nothing. I'll just see you tonight at my mom's. We can talk then. About that. I don't think it's such a good idea. I see. Well, my mom was really looking forward to having you over. Thanks. Hey. Hey. I'm glad you came. Well, people are finally uploading their videos, so we have just enough of a break. Well, come on up. I'm almost done. Sure. Only if I can clear the air. We're both up for the same job, and we'd both be great at it. Yeah, I should have said something as soon as you'd mentioned you'd applied, but the timing felt wrong. Thanks. I appreciate it. And, I get it. I mean, I just don't want it to be... Did you put all of the lights on the roof up by yourself? Well, my dad left the hooks up all year. Makes it a lot easier. That's a good trick. You know, I can drop out of the running if you want. What? Why? Max, no, that's ridiculous. No, if I get it... ...You would be my boss. Yeah. And if you get it, you'll be my boss. But what I was gonna say is, you have a shot at it, and I know I have a shot at it, and I think we're both mature enough to handle being candidates at the same time. So, we just... The best person for the job gets the job. That's just how it is. Okay. All right. It does feel good to get that out in the open. Yeah. So. Cheers. My mom hangs mistletoe right there every year. So I didn't realize we were... Oh, oh boy. Look at you two. Come in, come in and get warm. It's freezing out here. Hey. Hey. Jay, what are you... Hey, you made it! Well, the tree's not gonna decorate itself. Great. I'm so glad you're all here. It's so much more fun when there's more people. So, first question. Is the tree crooked? Mom, you always say that. No, it's really not. Well, it looks like it's twisting to the right. Doesn't it? Elle? I think it's perfect. All right, then. Well, the lights are up, here are the decorations, I'm gonna go finish my batch of cider. And then, you and I have an appointment with my computer. There. These are adorable. Yeah, yeah. Mom's an expert. What about this guy? That's third grade. Don't judge. No, no. I'm not judging. I have seen firsthand your decoration making skills. That wreath was impressive. Well, it's not as good as yours. You hung my wreath. Yeah, you hung mine. I thought it was nice. Oakley, how's the office party planning coming along? Spectacular. The food, the wine, the ice skating. That part I'm really proud of. It's actually gonna be a really fun Friday night. I can't wait for you to see it. I... don't know if I'll be able to make it, actually. Because we have our Misfit Christmas party that night. I know I should try to make both, but... it's just, this is something I look forward to all year. It's the only time I get to see the people that I'm closest to, and it kind of doesn't feel like Christmas without it. Plus, it's the same day as our interviews. I don't know about you, but I'm going to be exhausted. What interview? Look, I didn't want to get everyone's hopes up, especially not Mom's, but I applied for a creative director job here. Wait, the same job that Elle's up for? Yep. Yep. But we've already decided whoever is the best candidate for the job... Wait, you applied for a job here? Yeah. Max, that's awesome. Here's my famous iced cider. Oh, good. Spiced, or spiked? A little of both. All right. Well, cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, I post a picture here... Right? Yep. And share here? And then share here? I can't believe you made this website so fast. You got it. It's that easy. Yeah, and the more you practice, the easier it gets. That was so simple. But do not tell Max and Oakley I said so. They've been trying to get me to do this for a while. It's our secret. Mmkay. Why did you resist? Well, they had their father convinced that we would expand. I made the ornaments, and he took care of everything to do with the business. Well, it's obvious that you two love doing this together. Yeah. When he passed, I was so overwhelmed. Everything about the business reminded me of him. But, the memory keeps me hopeful. I used to look around at my friends at Christmastime, and it made me... It made me miss my Grandma. She loved Christmas traditions, she loved the planning, she loved the lists. And I was her little helper. Then I was her big helper. Until she... passed away when I was in college. I'm sorry. Then I decided that I could keep being sad, or I could make my own Christmas. And then over time I realized that traditions are really just honouring the love and the effort that someone put in before you, and even if that person who put in the effort isn't here anymore, we repeat traditions to keep them a part of us. That's so true. Wait. Is this... That is your first online order. A sale? We're heading out to the sleigh. Family tradition. Grab your coat. Okay, just a little... light here. Somehow this thing looks better and better every year. I can't believe you guys own your own sleigh. All right. I'm gonna get more of the decorations. Oakley, you want to help me? Yeah. Jay? Why don't you lend a hand? Thanks for helping Mom with her website. Oh, it's no sweat. They're pretty easy to build. Yeah, but taking the time to explain it to her, that's the important part. She's always been resistant to asking for help. Yeah, I know somebody like that. Oh, it's Fiona. Ooh. She called me too. I must have had the ringer off. Fiona. Hi. Yeah, yeah, I can talk. Okay. Here we go. Good. There we go, perfect. The ladies from my recipe circle, they come by and get their photo in the sleigh every year. You have an actual recipe circle? They don't just exchange recipes, they teach. It's actually pretty amazing. Well, the rule is, that you have to teach a traditional family recipe. There are so many incredible recipes. It, looks like we're back on duty. The client didn't like the videos. Fiona's asking if we can step it up. I think I know how. Okay, I've got you guys framed up. Okay. You ready? Yes. Where do I look? Where do I look? Where do I look? Just right into the camera, mom. Hey, everybody. My mom makes the best green bean casserole you will ever have in your life. And now she's gonna show us how she does it. Well, it's just green beans, and my homemade soup mix... And a little fried onions. And fried onions. Well, why don't you get me my apron? Yes. And we're going to need a cutting board. Okay. So you can get the cutting board. All right. Yep. There you are. That's perfect. Want me to tie it? Nope, that's okay. Looks good. Together? Yeah, so get your family together and make something that reminds you of Christmas at your home. Changing the videos to be about traditional family recipes. I think we're onto a solid thing here. Yeah. Me too. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. You want a ride? Depends how long it takes your car to warm up. Takes a minute. Yeah, so? Okay, come on girl. Tell me I did okay? That wasn't weird? With Oakley? No, you were great. I'm very impressed. And, I think the mom likes you. The mom loves you. Okay, you better blast that heat. Okay. There we go, there we go. Hey, you made it in! Look, Lucy. It's Auntie Elle. She's beautiful. Here. Hi. Hi, Lucy. It is so nice to meet you. The decorations look great, Alexis. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry I couldn't help. It was so fun. Kate and Jason got in last night, and we had eggnog, I saved you your stocking. You wanna go back to momma? Okay. There you go. She's so cute! Nice. See, you didn't miss anything. They've been telling us how busy your work is keeping you. Still gonna make a pie with Ryan though, I am coming home right after work. Elle, we were planning on going carolling tonight. I'm so sorry that all of this stuff got in the way of all this planning. Don't apologize, we get it. Okay. Well, you all have a great day, Jay and I are gonna go to work, and I'll see you soon. I'll see you soon. Hey, check it out. Max, are these numbers real? Not only did people start posting five times as many videos, but they're converting to sales. We've increased the videos by... Congratulations. You too. Well, I guess we just have our interview presentations to work on now, then. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good job. Hey. I'm gonna go meet the gang for lunch. And then ice skating. You sure you can't get away? I wish. I'm trying to back up all my ideas with numbers, and... I know you want this job, I know it's important to you, but eat! I just have to get this done, so I can go carolling and make a pie, and then finish this presentation. I've already missed so many other things. At least grab a sandwich. I'll bring one back for you. Look, I promise I will step out for a few minutes and grab one. All right. See you. Did you skate growing up? Not really. A few years ago, Jay and I took a lesson. It was fun. I've been meaning to ask. Your friend Jay... Is totally into your sister, yes. That's not what I was going to ask. Wait. So you and Jay are not... No! Did... does it seem like we are? Actually... No, we're not. Jay and I know both very clearly that we're not. So last night in Jay's car when you were... You left your scarf, and when I came back out with it from where I was standing, it looked... How would you feel about being wrong on that? I would feel relieved. Do you want to skate? Just for like 10 minutes? Okay. But only for 10 minutes, and only if I can think about work the whole time. Deal. My presentation's the same one I always do in interviews. So you interview a lot? I like to see what's out there, yeah. I want this job because it's close to my mom, but every once in a while something comes along that feels a little bit more like me. I can get the opportunity to build something. Plus, you have to be a real shark to work at a company like that. So you like the idea of working at a smaller company, huh? Yeah. What about you? What's your presentation? How does Elle Bennett sell herself? Well, my grandma raised me on a tight budget, and I like that we help people make informed decisions about what they buy. The internet is great, but we could do that in person. You know? We could do demos for cookware in stores and at the mall. And then it goes beyond that. If we're selling cars, we could do pop-up test drive events. We should focus on helping people try these products out before they buy. Well, those are great ideas. Are you going to pitch those in your interview? No. One thing at a time. If I get the job, then I will make it happen, but for now, I'll just focus on showing them what I'm best at. I'm sorry that I made an assumption about you and Jay. Especially since I was so clearly into coffee guy at the time. I probably shouldn't have said that. Since we work together. No. Coffee guy is happy that you did. Elle! Hey Elle! Hey guys. I was just... This isn't... How was lunch? Deep dish pizza's not the same anywhere else. And we got those amazing mint hot chocolates. My folks took Lucy for a nap. I was working and then I got hungry, and... This is Max. Nice to meet you. Hi. Can you join us for a quick skate around the rink? Actually, I should head back to work on my presentation. Well, we're going carolling tonight, if you can take a break. Max, you should come too. I don't want to intrude on your... No, no not at all. We'd let your family come meet ours. If you don't want to... Come on, let the man come and learn how truly bad we are at harmonizing. Gosh, I don't even know if I can come. But maybe I can, I will figure it out. Yes, yes. I'm in! Yeah, we'll go carolling tonight. Perfect. All right. Okay. See you tonight. Last one around the track changes diapers. That's you. That's on you. Not here... Listen, Elle. Carolling sounds fun, but if you need to... No, please come. I'll... I'll make it work. Okay. All right people, let's go spread some Christmas cheer. Christmas cheer! - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for coming. Oh, yeah. Your friends are fun. They told me a lot of great stories already. You should come to our party tomorrow night. The party games are epic. Thank you, but I'm gonna go to the office party. My sister organized it, the partners themselves are gonna be there, they're flying in from New York. They're the ones doing the interviews. Right. I know that part. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I should. Guess we'll have to make the pie later, huh? I meant to tell you, I already made the pie. You did? Yeah. This afternoon. You okay? Of course. Yeah. Looks like everything for the party's coming together. Okay. Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Okay. Is that Elle? Okay. Oh, wait. Hi. Hey. What time's your interview? Four o'clock. Yours? Two o'clock. You nervous? Not really. ...A little. You? Nope. Yes. No. Well, then. Good luck today. You too. Whatever happens. Best person for the job. Missed your coffee this morning. I was running late. You sure that's it? I know that you've missed out on a few of the things you love about this party. I'm just excited that it's happening. Once I get there, I'll... Once you get there, you'll...? I'll be fine. I'm excited, that's all. It's gonna be tough to get there by 6:00. Elle? Just a head's up, we're running pretty far behind. It'll be closer to 5:00 before we get you in. Great, no problem. Hey. Good luck in there. All you have to do is show them all the best things about my best friend. I question whether calling something a social media event even means anything. The internet only feels real. The idea is to create real life events. People talk about organic food, organic materials. This is organic marketing. Cooking demos for cookware. Test drive events, not at the dealership, but places people actually go. Get people to use the products before they buy them. Elle? Elle? Hey. There you are. I couldn't find you. Because I... I heard what you told Fiona and the board. Yes. Look, I'm sorry if I overstepped boundaries, but it just seemed like the right decision. The right decision. To steal my ideas? Wait, what are you talking about? The cooking demos and the pop-up test drives, and everything that we talked about yesterday. You stole those? Stole? Is that really who you think I am? I didn't, until I heard it. I guess I should have known. You have to be a real shark. Your words, I mean, you said that. And now you're throwing that back in my face to accuse me of... That's... I guess adorable meetings in coffee shops are exactly how they feel. Yeah. Too good to be true. I can't believe it. I was just starting to like the guy, too. He's funny and charming, and... He said it himself, though. Should have seen it coming. People tell you who they are. Sorry we're running late. Please come in. Party starts in ten minutes. Go. You'll be late as it is. No, I don't want to go without you, Elle. I'll just, I'll wait here with you and then... No. Look, you all did such a great job pulling it together. I... I'm gonna miss most of it, but at least I know it happened and everyone had fun. You shouldn't miss it too. Go. Make my apologies. Merry Christmas, Elle. Merry Christmas, Jay. All right. Again, I'm so sorry we're so behind. Last two. You are next. So sorry that this is running late. The good news is, we can all walk over to the company Christmas party together. At least I'll make one party today. Your ideas have already made an impression in there. My ideas? Max Turner walked in there, started his presentation, and then spent most of the time telling us you were great. He did? He said you had ideas he was afraid you wouldn't get a chance to share. And he wanted to make sure we knew. But, why would he? Because he stepped out of the running. He actually resigned the company, said he's going to another opportunity. See you in a bit. And at the end of the day, if a consumer can interact with a product and make an informed choice, our clients will see that translate into sales, and that's across all of our brands. Very impressive, Miss Bennett. You not only have very good ideas, but you back them up with figures and secondary plans. That's good marketing. Best of all, you're thinking outside of just cookware. These ideas work across all of our divisions. One last question, Miss Bennett. Why do you think you should be one of our creative directors? Well, my record has some impressive numbers. One of the ways that I think I... Honestly, because while I take this very seriously, I'd rather we were all at a Christmas Party right now. I beg your pardon? Every year, we all gather around friends and family for Christmas, right? How do you plan them, in your life? Your home? Who does that work? Well, actually, I have a sister who cooks a lot, and my son is always a big help. And which part to you is better? The party or setting it up with your sister and son? Actually, both now that I think of it. Exactly. You see, every year, I have this little group of wonderful humans, and we... Well, I set up the decorations with Alexis. My friend Jay and I go shopping for gifts because... well, because he's hopeless at it. My friend Ryan and I, we make a pie. The recipe for which we have been perfecting since college, but he doesn't know that we've been perfecting the recipe, he just... likes being there. And yes, I love the process of setting it up, just as much as I love the party. But this year, I didn't get to do a lot of it. And I realized that I didn't so much miss doing the things as much as I missed... The people. Exactly. And it's the same for getting through the workday. Planning a party. Making something you love. Falling in love. Or, any kind of campaign. Yes. We take all of the pieces and we make the effort to put it together. But none of it means anything if you're not doing it for people. That's why me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere that I have to try to get to, if you wouldn't mind. Your honesty is refreshing. Good luck to you, Miss Bennett. Thank you. Jay, I don't know why you're not answering, but I'm on my way, I just... I just have to stop and straighten things out with... Max. How'd you do in there? Pretty well I think. I don't know, it's always hard to tell with those things. Yeah. Look, Max. I overreacted. I was angry and confused because it didn't seem like you. I jumped to a conclusion. Just like I did when I thought that you and Jay were... Except you gave me the space to tell you the truth. I didn't return that kindness. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't explain or ask your permission to go in there and pitch your ideas. I just wanted them to know that you were perfect for the... No, just perfect. End of sentence. Look, we're both... Pretty tired? Yeah. Yeah. Let's get you to your Christmas party with your friends. Oh wait. It's this way. Yeah. Come on. Great! You made it, both of you. About time. This way, please. I don't understand. Well, I had to get you here to the party somehow. Turns out when I signed for the place, I got the atrium space even though we didn't need it. Excuse me. When Max told me about the interviews running long... You did this? Merry Christmas, Elle. Merry Christmas. Wait, what is happening? Well, we started the party in the coffee shop, but then Jay said you weren't going to make it in time. And so, we asked ourselves what you'd do, and Jay talked to Oakley... And I called... Me. Your friends are great. Yeah. They are. Yeah, we're pretty good. Oh, Nancy. I wouldn't have missed it, and I'm so glad things worked out. Thank you. Guys! If it was any one of us, you would have made sure the party came to us. I don't know what to say. Thank you. Thanks all of you. This is the best Misfit Christmas surprise ever. Wait, I don't think we can call it Misfit Christmas anymore. Almost Family Christmas? Or Found Family Christmas? How about just Family Christmas? Well, come on. There's tons of food, let's eat. There's a whole pie here! Oh yeah! I have to hand it to you. You pulled off a good... Networking event? A good Christmas party. Just wait until you see the party I throw when you launch your new company. Well, it's not my company, it's Mom's company. I'm just gonna turn it into the biggest family-run decoration company yet. Here's hoping. It's what Dad would have wanted. Do you mind if I get your thoughts on a few things? Sure. You're really leaving the company? Let's just say I found a better opportunity to do what I love. If we don't work together, then we could go back to being those people in the coffee shop. We definitely should. So, now that work's done... ...and the party is happening... ...I can just... relax into Christmas? With me. Yeah. With you.
