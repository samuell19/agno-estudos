(Woman) Oh! Paula! How can you do this? Mother, please don't be hyper-dramatic. I've prepared for months. I've made so many wedding plans for you and Collins. It was never definite. He didn't even ask me. He asked you, Mother. Shut up young lady! Just sit down and zip your lip. You are engaged to Collins Hedgeworth. Did you know she's engaged to Collins Hedgeworth? I never said I would marry Collins. Sir I realize that there is some conflict here. Oh! He realizes there's a conflict. (chuckles) You're the conflict Charlie. Mr. Powers we're in love. We wanna get married and I felt that you ought to be invited to the wedding. Get out of my mansion. Why don't you wait for me in the car? Get off my estate! I think we should try and keep things in perspective and be open-minded. Get this fortune hunter out. Get him out! Wait a minute. I am not a fortune hunter! I don't care about your money Sir. Your money doesn’t mean anything to me! Fortune hunter out! Wait on the corner. I have to talk to them. How dare you call Sam Freeman a fortune-hunter! He is an environmental research major. Come here. I'm gonna show you something. I want you to look at something. I've seen your poster Dad. I've been planning on this for seven years. And I expect a little cooperation from you. I'll do everything I can do to help you but-- Forget Sam what's-his-face! Dad! Collins is the finest, the richest, the most suitable young man in the country. He's a flake! Oh I think you're exaggerating. I'm not marrying Collins! I'm marrying Sam just as soon as we can get to Las Vegas. You do that and I'll disinherit you. I'll cut off your credit! I'll take away your goddamn sports car! No. No. I bought that myself with my own money. (chuckles) I'm going to my room. Well go to your room! Well I guess I shut down her hot little motor. From now on she's not even gonna cross the street without my permission. (tires screeching) Paula! Grand Theft Where's your car? I traded with Dad. My God she's been brainwashed. I Want my Rolls-Royce! I want my daughter and I want you to find some way to put this Sam Freeman in the slammer for a while. I understand. I don't want the police and I don't want the news media. It will be done with our usual quiet. confidential finesse. All right let's move on this. We'll need your plane to get to Barstow ahead of them. All rightI'll meet you at the airport. Here. I can't believe it. I can't believe we're actually doing this. Incredible. Yeah. I'm sorry your parents don't like me better though. Don't worry. I like you enough for both of them. OK that's it. You wanna pull over and fool around a little? Sam! Sam! OK. OK you're right. I lost my head. Ah. All right. We'll be there in about five hours if we don't have any problems. Sure you don't want to pull off the road? (telephone ringing) Paula? No Collins Hedgeworth calling. Collins. I'm playing an important polo match today and Paula had indicated that she would like to come by and observe my prowess sometime. Oh Collins. I am so glad you called. Paula has eloped. She's going to Las Vegas to marry one of her little school friends. She took the Rolls-Royce. She's engaged to me. Oh Collins I can't tell you how much I counted on your relationship with her. Your patience your understanding and your maturity. Ah! Collins? Priscilla will you hurry up? Christ Almighty. the cab's been waiting for two minutes. Collins if you're still there goodbye. Oh, oh yes. Mrs. Wilson. we're very excited. Thanks. We'll see you then. Everything's confirmed. The chapel is reserved. Wow. (DJ) Hello. everybody. This is "The Squirrely Curly Q Brown Rockin' Jock Show" coming at you from the strongest station in Southern California radio Ten-Q. (honking) Hey man. You left your lights on. (laughs) Peasant! Sir! My fiancee's been abducted. I was in pursuit of her captor. who is en route to Las Vegas. I had a minor accident. I'm in dire need of transportation. Well, we've got... Ah! That'll do fine! Well you've got a fine eye there boy. She's a runner too. Bill my father. I don't know if we can let you have the car on that kind of a deal. I'm Collins Hedgeworth! My father is Montgomery Hedgeworth! My grandfather is Elwood Hedgeworth. Collectively my family is worth $97 million. I don't know. I'll have to check with the manager on this. (grunts) Hey! Hey boy, that's aggravated grand theft! He borrowed it Lieutenant. And if a Hedgeworth borrows a car I'm sure there must be a very good reason. And I will not tolerate police harassment. Mrs. Hedgeworth if you... I'm going after him myself. And if you must chat speak to my shrink. Yes? Mm. Yes. Uh-huh. (buzzer buzzes) (seat-belt signal dings) This stupid thing. (buzzer buzzes) Rex. I'm borrowing your car! Hey man! Goddamn Lupe. Some mother stole my goddamn wheels. I ain't gonna take that shit. I'm calling the police. (mouths) "I Wanna help you" Oh God. What's the matter? lt's Collins Hedgeworth. He looks a little frazzled. You want me to talk to him? I will. Collins I don't need your help! I'm here to save you! I'm sorry if you misunderstood. but we are not engaged. We never were engaged. Has he got a gun on you? No! So please leave us alone. Is there a bomb in the car? Look, it's obvious she doesn’t wanna talk to you so why don’t you just drop it? I hesitate to do this with Paula in the car. But I am a superior driver and I will batter you into submission if need be! I will bump you off this highway! Wait! Pull over. He's all right! Paula! Wait! My mother said I can have you! I've got a Ten-Q exclusive here for all you Squirrely Curly Q fans. So turn up your crystal sets. Go ahead. sir. My name is Collins Hedgeworth. My longtime fiancee. Paula Powers. has been abducted in her father's vintage 1959 Rolls-Royce and is being forced to drive to Las Vegas for some highly immoral purpose. As a result. I am offering a $25,000 reward to anyone who can safely free and protect her until I can arrive. Here we are. Are the police working on this? Absolutely not. Paula has been brainwashed. She's probably been sexually assaulted. I refuse to have her subjected to the ordeal and embarrassment of rape interrogation by the police! That's why I'm appealing to you and your loyal listeners. I am taking it to the streets Mr. Brown. Can you give us a description of your fiancée? She's a vision. A lovely vision with light brown hair. An absolute angel. And the guy who shanghaied her? Wild red hair, burning eyes, thrusting jaw. There's a primitive. barroom look about him. Threatening and definitely dangerous. Well that's a heart-wrenching tale man. And we'll do what we can. There you have it- a young man with a problem. And apparently lots of big bucks to help solve it. Whatever it is. it's a Ten-Q exclusive. 25,000 crisp ones! Shoot man. I could build us a machine so bad... How bad? That we'd be racing at Indy in two years. $100 an hour! You set the price! We gotta take this baby for a little test spin anyway right? Part of our job. All right, contact. Hammer down! Sir, I'd like to buy your truck. lt's an emergency. Well, if you don't want to sell it I'll rent it. I'm desperate! So am I feller! I hope nobody sees me in this wreck. Yes. $25,000 for the return of my son. So impulsive. For the safe return... Please put that message on the air for me. OK Mrs. Hedgeworth. Are you sure you don't wanna do it yourself? No. no. I haven't time. (horn blaring) (mouths) "Wow" All kinds of nuts are gonna go after a reward like that. Now maybe if we just switch... We went to Reno or Tahoe or something... Sam we can't let Collins or my father or anybody else intimidate us. Now we said we were going to Vegas. That's where we should go. What do you think? I think you're pretty stubborn. No, I'm tenacious. Oh. Look out Vegas! We're coming in. (siren) Car 47 in pursuit of Volkswagen, orange, License number YCU799. Driver committed a moving violation and is fleeing south on Florence. Car 47. you are pursuing a 503. Ah.. uh. a 503? A stolen vehicle. Oh right right. A 503 right right. Jesus, a 503. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! (crowd) Hallelujah! That's right! And the whole Earth reeled and it rocked and rolled a little. Amen! Because He was angry. Angry because I hadn't called on Him sooner. Praise the Lord. That's right. And black smoke boiled out of His nostrils... I prayed till... What...? Oh my God. (siren stops) (engine turns over) Sister, have you made a commitment to the Lord? My husband gave at the office. All right, everybody stand back. Officer coming through. All right lady out of the car. I'm rushing to save my son. He is racing to Las Vegas in some maroon hot Charger with a white roof. And you know how reckless these young people can be. If he's anything like you lady he ought to be put away. Don't be facetious. ID, lady. I am Vivian Hedgeworth. And I have just offered a $25,000 reward over channel Ten-Q for the safe return of my son. (turning engine) Quit cranking the car. You're under arrest! Collins must be saved from himself! Amen. All right lady, I'm gonna recite your rights... Lady! I gotta recite your rights! What in the Lord's name are you doing? $25,000 Now that's a lot of bibles baby. Jesus, my vehicle! I'm commandeering this vehicle. Follow those cars! Piss off pig! Come on Hiram, help the boy out. Piss off, piss off! Hiram! All right, all right. Don't get your bells in an uproar. Look out. The upshot of Mrs. Hedgeworth's call is this: There is now a $25,000 reward for Collins Hedgeworth's fiancée as well as a $25.000 reward for Collins Hedgeworth. Now that is $50,000 big ones. And for you folks out there looking for that little pot of gold. the highway patrol reports that Collins Hedgeworth is alleged to have stolen a black and yellow Chevy pickup and eyewitnesses have stated they have seen him on the road to Victorville. Stay in contact. Cars are ready. Mr. Slinker. Excellent. All right men. Cast the Velvet Net. (elderly Woman) Curly Q. I listen to your program all the time. and this Paula Powers kidnapping has got me so mad that I just had to call in and speak my mind. Well. you go right ahead on ma'am. That pervert that kidnapped Paula ought to be shot down like a dog on the street. Well that sounds a little harsh ma'am. Well then they ought to cut off his marbles! You're sick. But I love ya. I've just received word that we have Miss Paula Powers on the line. Miss Powers? This is Paula Powers. Am I on the air? Yes you are. Can you talk? Hell yes I can talk! And I want everyone to know that I have not been kidnapped. And you couldn't call what Sam and I have done rape. I know what I'd call it! Yeah! Gettin' down! His name's Sam? Sam Freeman. And I love him and that's why we're going to Las Vegas to get married. Well, what about this engagement to Collins Hedgeworth? There is no engagement. My father tried to make me marry him but I just never felt... Well, I don't find him... Well Mr. Brown, he's a turkey. She's under hypnosis! I had to call and clear this up. Well, you certainly have shed a new beam of light on this situation. And I personally think it's absolutely barbaric for a girl to be forced into a marriage with a turkey! I mean, can you imagine what the kids would look like? Best of luck to both of you from Squirrely Curly and we're gonna be rooting for ya. Thanks Curly. Goodbye. Hey, that was great. Hey, we just passed the Rolls! Drop back! Hey, that's the chick. man! That's the chick! Get her to pullover! Hey, one of your wheels is loose! Yeah, your rear end's starting to shimmy! Hey, you better stop and tighten your lug nuts! Go on! Will you pull over? What do you think? Floor it. I got it. I got the Rolls-Royce under surveillance. Roger Eagle 1. Eagle 1, hereafter code name for Rolls-Royce will be "Quarry." OK, all right there's a turnoff about a mile up here. It's a good one and then we can start taking side roads. I think we ought to stay on 15 and get there just as fast as we can. No we gotta get off the main drag. There'll be reward hunters all over. We'll get lost if we go out in the desert. No we won't. I got it right here. There's the turnoff. Let's lose these jokers. OK. Move it! I got 'em! I got 'em! All right! Hang 'em. Stay with 'em! This is some test spin! Quarry just now flew the track. Yeah. They're rolling due east on an unmarked road approximately five miles south of Victorville. Roger. Keep me informed. What happened to Barstow. Slinker? Huh? Here's where they are now. This is Base 1. Wrap Velvet Net. Proceed east on Route 66 to Daggett. Further instructions will follow. (over megaphone) Throw the devil out of the driver's seat. Pull his foot off the gas. Slow down for God's sake. and prepare to meet Jesus! Sweet Jesus! (siren Wailing) (ye/ling) You goddamn chicken fucker! Pull up so I can do it to 'em! Hey baby! Hey baby! Hey you want a drink? Ha-ha! Hee-hee! You'd better pull over honey bun! Yeah 'cause we're crazy. (laughs) What'll I do? All right, hang a left. Uh, Quarry took a hard left on to a rough dirt road. heading due north. They've turned. and they're heading up to Route 66. Where the Velvet Net will be waiting and bag 'em right here. See? She's taken my car up that lousy road? What in the hell's wrong with that girl? Get back on the road man! Get off my case! I'm driving! Aw, man. Stay on the road! I am. I am! Give me a break! Oh, no! Oh, man! Lost the brakes! It don't matter. Just keep on going. The steering's gone! Oh. shit! It stopped. Maybe we can fix it. Probably not. No sign of 'em. Must have had car trouble. Good. I am not in the service of the law but in the service of the Lord. If you doubt my word just look up my son. Get your answer from the heavens. Eagle 1. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Shut off your engine for Jesus my son. Know the joy of coasting for Christ. We'll just stay on these side roads now and we got it made. Velvet Net is spread. (honking) You'd better move your tail Charlie or you're gonna get it bent! All right now, don't panic. This is gonna work. NOW! Number two's swinging to the left but keep him off the road. Car three get behind him! Where the hell are they? I thought you were watching them. Think I'm gonna throw up. I think I see 'em. I'm zeroing in. Ha-ha! We got him now! (crash) (coughing) Boy. Slinker's gonna be pissed. Yeah yeah, the drivers are OK. But the cars are totaled! I wish you could see this Ned. Ned, the cars are all sandwiched together. Shut up and stay with the Quarry. How's the car? Couldn't be better. That's a hell of a set of wheels. Well, we're going mobile. I'll stay in touch. Base 1 out. Pack the van. (phone beeps) Hello? How's everything? You and the Rolls? We're both fine. Paula. I'd feel an awful lot better about everything if you'd just turn around and come back home. Dad... I want you well married. Your mother and I have always had that dream. Well, my dream is marrying Sam Freeman. Well, that's... that's a damned lousy dream! It's a great dream and that's what I'm gonna do. Keep it steady. I'm gonna talk her over. Pull it over lady. Look, you pull it over and I'll have the DA take it easy on you. (honks) (Woman) Get the door. Here comes our ride. Hey! Hey! Here! Hey hey hey! Wait! No! The black and yellow pickup on the radio! The Hedge-face dude! Yeah, but there's a pig mobile after him. For 25 thou. we can spring him! I've got it. Because of hundreds of sympathetic calls. Because you the public demanded to know more about those fabulous Vegas-bound lovers. I am taking a command flight to the scene of that momentous chase. Somewhere out there on the desert. Two young lovers are puffing their lives on the line and are defying the World in their bid for togetherness. So stay tuned to Ten-Q. This is Squirrely Curly going aloft. Ten-Q listens to you Yeah. Ten-Q listens to you Leave it right here I Ten-Q... Hold her steady! I'm going in! Get your foot out of my crotch! I'm boarding this Bug lady. Oh!! All right, out of the car! You're under arrest! And you are an obscene person! Ah now. That's assaulting an officer! All right! All right! All right! All right! You have a right to an attorney. You have the right to remain silent. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you. Do you understand? Whoo! You think you can hotwire this mother? No necito man. El key-o in el ignition-ario. You crack me up when you talk Mexican. Ee-hee! (engine starts) Hey! Dirty rotten underhanded cruds! (Woman) You couldn't wait could you Mr. Everhard? (yelling) (Curly Q) The Honeymoon Camper brings the total to ten in the last two hours. That's grand theft auto on a rather grand scale. It all seems to be somehow connected to the Paula Powers-Sam Freeman love flight to Vegas. I'm gonna bust this crime spree if I have to go all the way to Las Vegas to do it! Sin City, here we come! Whoo! (all cheering) All right, all right. Listen to this. There once was a girl from LA who was determined to go all the way. Sam! To Vegas. All the way to Vegas. Right. Uh her mother screamed “no" her father yelled “whoa". But they married the first day of May. Oh. that's nice. Thank you. And then they rolled in the hay. Oh yes! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen you have just heard it a sexy rhyme from Miss Paula Powers. Miss Powers. Miss Powers. Please tell me, what brought on this sudden case of the hots? Well. I guess I... I just love you. I love you too. (radio) What you gonna do when she says goodbye ? Whoa! Whoa. I'd better keep control of myself. Yeah. Only when you're driving though. How many killed? Nobody's hurt but we need a ride. (laughs) Think you got film in your camera? Yeah. sure. Well I want a picture of this. That's the damnedest wreck I ever saw. People ain't gonna believe this. I'll take one of you, you take one of me. You can take all the pictures you want. Thank you. Let's try one right here. Yeah. OK. Look this way. OK. Cock your head a little. That's it. Hey. where you going? (laughs) Drive carefully! Velvet Net leader to Base 1. What do you want? We've acquired a four-wheel-drive vehicle and are mobile again. They're mobile again. Oh, they're mobile. Big deal. You're a good bunch of men. We're a good bunch of men. I suggest you try gaining time by taking that four-Wheel drive job cross country. Roger, Base 1. We'll give it the old college try. Yahoo! Any of you out there seen a Rolls or a black and yellow pickup come on back. (Woman) Mm howdy Flying Cottage this is Hotpants. I saw a rig like that running north toward Kelso. That's probably him! I'm headed down to Essex for a little skinny-dip party. Like to have some fun? Jesus bet your buns Hotpants! No. Would you just get off the radio man and start looking for that road to Kelso? Next time Hotpants next time. You know, I believe I've seen that girl on television. Uh... What's her name? Paula Powers. Paula Powers? No. I don't believe I ever heard of her before. Well, I guess I got my head up my rectum again. Hmm. There they go. Follow that car. I always love saying that. I want you to stop a black and yellow Rolls- Royce at the bridge. Do you hear me? All right, Max! Now get outta here! Whoa-eel 25 Gs. Oh. get me out of this godforsaken desert. This is getting a little out of hand. All right. All right now. Come on. Straighten that wire out there. Come on boy! Move! We ain't got all day. I've had it with this guy. Pull over and I'm gonna punch him out. No, I'm not gonna pull over so you can punch him out. Hold it. Hold it. NOW! Come on! Now! Jesus. Did you see that? Sweet Lord Jesus Max, if he ain't dead he's gonna kill us! Their tails are worth $25,000! Some crazy rich kids. Go after it! Let's go! Come on you egg-brained offsprings! I'm gonna kill you both! We're a good bunch of men. (laughs) Yes! Yes! It must be them. Ladies and gentlemen we have overtaken the Rolls-Royce. This could be one of the most electrifying moments in radio history. Paula Powers and Sam Freeman are directly beneath me at this moment. streaking across the desert Wasteland. (Collins) I'm ahead of them. How did I get ahead of them? Bless you son! My prayers have been answered. Oh my God! Lord help you boy! I will catch up with you. Lord help you boy. (Curly Q) The black and white car 47 seems to be pursuing Collins Hedgeworth in the black and yellow pickup. They are gunning directly at the Rolls-Royce. The road is blocked. A collision seems inevitable! You're bananas. Pull off! Yaah! Hallelujah! Whoo! Let me go! I gotta stop my fiancée! It is God's will that I caught you and God's will that I collect. All right. Help me stop my fiancée. and you'll get it all. $50,000. Swear on the bible. I swear! Amen! Let's go. Come on brother. Let's go. We'll build us a whole tabernacle. It's impossible to know what transpired between the two. But the preacher is driving car 47. Not back to Los Angeles. but north toward the highway 68. Is it possible they're going in pursuit of Paula Powers? I would guess yes! We're almost at 68. Let me have the wheel so we can move this cracker box! Piss off! Eagle 1, give me an estimation of their ground speed. Over the CB. Well. that's a toughie, Ned. Speed can vary so much. This is Bigby Powers. Will you answer the question? No more than 60 on an average. That's all we wanted to know. I got something hot. I'm gonna go with this. Put me on the air now. Break into the record. Ladies and gentlemen. In a shocking discovery I have just learned that Paula Powers is the daughter of multimillionaire gubernatorial candidate Bigby Powers. That's true. And that he himself is involved in a plot to stop his daughter from marrying Sam Freeman. He has a chopper in the air. numerous agents in the field that can close in on the Rolls-Royce at any moment and wrest young Paula from her lover thus ending this bizarre odyssey. Now, for you folks at home who would like to follow the action on your maps. Find highway 68. Now Paula and Sam are ten miles north of Cima headed toward that road. Now back to the station for more music, facts and facts as I stand by on the Ten-Q sky-watch. (telephone rings) Thank you for calling The Curly Q Brown Show. I wanna talk to Mr. Brown. Well. Mr. Brown's in the air. I know he's in the air. This is Sam Freeman. Sam Freeman? I'll patch you right in. Sam Freeman, the man of the moment. How you doing. Sam? You're full of crap. You know that Curly? You wish us good luck and then you tell everybody where we are. Sam... I want you to cut it out. Sam, you created this situation. I didn't. But you went through a lot of trouble to make it a great human interest story. Now you're broadcasting to the whole world. “Right down here ladies and gentlemen. Stop the Vegas-bound lovers and hit the $25,000 jackpot.“ You're hovering up there like a vulture hoping for a wreck. Well, if you have it. I'm gonna report it. Because every time you turn around and fart it's news. You say anything you want but just don't pinpoint us on the map. I've been in radio a long time kiddo and you just don't let something like this go by. It's just too big. (announcer) We interrupt this broadcast for a special bulletin from Curly Q Brown. Hello again! I've just been in contact with Paul Powers and Sam Freeman and God bless 'em they're doing fine. And incidentally they're streaking towards highway 68 and the Nevada border at this very moment. What an ass. They're a little distraught... That's great, Curly. Just great. (Curly Q) Wait just a minute. Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Freeman is leaning out of the Rolls-Royce. He's making a friendly gesture at me! I'm waving back. What a sportsman young Sam is. Oh, yeah. I got you spotted Base 1. You're approximately, uh... three miles from the junction. It looks close. I think you got a shot at beating 'em. We are on 68. They're approaching from the side road. Get them bottled right here. All we have to do is cork it. Quarry is gaining. Kick this tin can in the ass. Kick it! I have cracked the code on another secret transmission. There is a dramatic confrontation brewing out here in this barren, desolate area as that wealthy tyrant and would-be governor Bigby Powers is racing to personally intercept his daughter as she and Sam Freeman emerge from the back roads of the desert off the Highway 68. It is a race to the junction as the stakes are high. Both vehicles are flat-out. This is a contest. not just between father and daughter but between the forces of power and oppression on one side and romance and free will on the other. They may be outrunning you. They have got to be stopped. Swoop in and slow them down. Swoop in, Ned? That's right. The whirlybird has pulled out of its dive and is playing a veritable game of chicken with those two courageous kids in the Rolls-Royce. Make another pass at them. (Curly Q) They're going closer. Don't worry! They'll pull off! Don't worry. They'll pull off. Neither will give an inch. Oh my God, they're gonna crash! And the Whirlybird is a chickie bird! Those two nervy young lovers unflinchingly held their own. I did it. I did it! I kicked his butt! Yes, they've Won this lap but who knows what the next "power" play will bring us? What will that thin ribbon of highway to Vegas lead to? Perhaps everlasting happiness or perhaps tragedy. I want results. Do you hear that, Slinker? I want results! All right... l'm playing the ace. It may be a little messy but you'll get your results. Your call, sir. Yes? Sir, this is Ned Slinker. Ned Slinker from Los Angeles. I need help, sir. Ned, you're a nice person. But it bothers me that you only call me when you're in trouble. We've got the momentum now, Sam, and we're gonna do it. We're going all the way! I'm gonna beat him to Vegas and I'm gonna get married. Then let him look at the scoreboard. Aren't you excited? Beating your old man doesn't make my day, you know. It would if you knew him like I do. lt's a circus, Paula. We got a cockamamie circus on our hands. My client may be the next governor of California. Ned, I'll give you the men. Hurry up! I want that $25,000. Ram that Rolls-Royce off the road faster you feather-headed... Faster. faster. faster! Keep it steady. Now we gonna have a bang-up time. Dynamite! Those nuts! They're throwing dynamite! You friggin' fruit stand! (Paula) There's a cop. Good! He's gonna get 'em. Unless they get us first. (siren) Jeez! Just keep swerving! I am! I am! You cockamamie Kojak! God, what a mess. Well, we made it didn't we? (Curly Q) I repeat they are in Nevada. The $25,000 reward is still up for grabs as no one seems able to stop Sam Freeman and his hard-driving lovely Paula Powers. (overlapping chatter) Pass the glue, man. (speaks Spanish) Let's go get that Rolls. That's them. Peel out. (Woman) Come on. That's them! Let's go. Let's go! I couldn't care less what my father thinks about you. This thing between you and him makes me feel like I'm the man in the middle. I am. I'm the man in the middle. Keep going! Don't stop! Don't stop! You're a good bunch of men. We're a good bunch of men. (laughs) Sam, why are you dragging your feet? Dragging my feet? I'm headed for the church at 100 miles an hour. You can't call that dragging my feet. I don't like your attitude. What do you expect? Dog tricks? Bigby Powers has brought in more manpower under the code name of "Vegas Muscle" to prevent Paula and Sam from reaching Vegas and ever realizing their dream. Vegas Muscle in position one mile beyond the city limits. I'm just telling you that it was handled all wrong from the very beginning. It couldn't have been handled any other way. Bullshit! That is total bullshit! Do you wanna go through with this or not? Well? Well, I don't think it should be what I want or what you want. I just think it should be what we want. What's right for us. That's what I've been trying to do. Yeah? You took your father's car. You didn't work it out with your ex-fiancé... He was never my fiancé. Whatever he was he turned the whole thing into a carnival! On top of that, you refuse to change our destination. Even though we got all these nuts out trying to stop us. Now, let me tell you something - that was not us making those decisions. You're really making me mad, Sam. They have made a radical left-hand turn in the town of Henderson and have vanished. Are they planning to marry here instead of Vegas? Reverse your direction, damn it! You watch your trash mouth, boy! Did you ever think that as soon as you get over the excitement of defying your dad... Sam... Let me just say this because this has been bothering me. Did you ever think that you might miss being rich? Because let me tell you - I couldn't care less about big cars or mansions or making a million dollars. I couldn't either! I don't care about those things. Yes, you do. You grew up with those things. You're gonna miss those things. lt's gonna bug you to be poor. Why are you so worried about money and my father? I thought we decided to get married. Now you seem to have changed your mind. Well, hell. We went this far. Let's just go through with it. No! You go on without me. Will you get in the car? Forget it! He really spoiled it for us. Paula, get in this car. No! Not until we make a decision. Now, if you don't have faith in our love. If you don't think it strong enough to overcome the obstacles. Then we shouldn't bother. The whole thing wasn't worth it.

Now dig on Curly Q because I'm laying rubber. I've done it all today to Ten-Q. folks. But the job is not complete. I've traded my wings for wheels and am following Paula and Sam directly to their hotel and right into their honeymoon suite for another Ten-Q exclusive. By the Way. I'll be making very special... Could you try and lose this ding-dong? appearance at the grand opening of Taco Village. America's most loveable couple has turned off the Strip but I'm right behind them. Hopefully we can learn that Paula and Sam perform as well in the bridal caper as they do behind the Wheel of a Rolls-Royce. I'm racing to be there for the climax of their climax. Congratulations! Mr. and Mrs. Sam Freeman. How about a few words? Yeah, come on! Say something for the fans! I made you stars! You would stiff old Squirrely Curly would you? Come on! Come on! Jesus Christ! Aah!
