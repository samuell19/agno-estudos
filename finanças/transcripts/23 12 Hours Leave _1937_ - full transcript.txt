Remove the evidence til after breakfast. Right. Peggy! Good morning Daddy. What are you doing up so early? Breakfast with the General. Breakfast? Don't want any. Daddy! No, I'm late now.

Well, I will if I want to! Home from school only two days and I'm in hot for $3000! Tommy! Call up that agency, tell them to the take it away. I believe it's rather early to call the agency, Sir. Well, then, later. But call them! Yes. Now then. What's for breakfast? Wheat cakes, Sir. Wheat cakes. Every day for a week. In this great big country there must be one egg. Sgt.

Well if this occurs again you will be denied leave for an entire month, you understand? Yes, Sir. Well that's all. Yes, Sir. Oh. Two prunes. Old prunes with wrinkles. We declared war against the wrong guy. Prunes, why don't they give us a breakfast like I used to get at home? Everything from soup and... thank you. Hey [inaudible]. Did you page me, Sir? You's got any more of these gaskets? Yeah, we're just fresh out. Heh. You [inaudible] Robert give me a pain in the neck. That's nice work if you can get away with it. Listen, buddy, Gray's won enough bets from us guys to pay for a million flap jacks. The guy's draped with horseshoes and festooned with four leaf clovers. Yeah, but he never fails to loan a pal dough. Yeah, and he never fails to collect either. Hey, you've got a nerve, taking Gray's cakes. Hey, taint fair to cheat a buddy out of patty cakes. I'll mind this one for him. Where is that sleepy sergeant? Ah, he's in Conference with the officer of the day. Probably working on a plan for having his breakfast served in bed, the lucky stiff. - Hello, General! - [inaudible] - [inaudible] - [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible], old boy? As you were, men. We were so upset Robert, when you was late for breakfast, your orange juice got warm and you patty cakes got cold. Oh, it's OK. I don't miss the gaskets anyhow. Oh, no? No. As a matter of fact, I was thinking very sorrowfully of you boys this morning as the officer-of-the-day and I dallied over breakfast. What, only the OD? Tsk, tsk, tsk. I thought you'd invited the general staff. Gray, do you want to bet me you had breakfast with the OD? - Wait, I'm in on that. - And me. Me too. Oh, all set for a killing, eh? Well I'll go you one better than that. I'll lay ya even money, Yeah. That I'll have breakfast with the General. Oh, sure, maybe after the war. No, within a month. And will that breakfast include patty cakes for the sergeant? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He will have roast pheasant on toast, You mean roast mule on bran. Listen, you mugs. Even money I have breakfast with the General, including patty cakes. How about that? Ho, Ho, what, no takers? Tsk, tsk, tsk, I'm disappointed. How would a two to one bet interest you pikers? Come on! Five will get you ten. Oh, no, not me. You're taking me to the cleaners too often. Yeah, maybe I haven't been hooked for plenty. Hey, for a guy that just had breakfast with the OD, you seem mighty hungry to me. Prunes arouse the sergeant in me. Yeah, that's more than Reveille does. You know, Mugs? I wouldn't be surprised if we sailed in a week. Anybody want to bet? I'm through being a sucker. Yeah, it's the way he springs them bets that gets me. Like that. And before you know it. You bite. And you're hooked. Boy, you're stupideous. Ha, ha, ha. Payday! We happen to be in the Army. What would the Army be if we didn't happen to be in the Army, there'd be no Army. Imagine if we had joined the Navy. What would the Army be if we ever happened to be in the Navy, there'd be no Army. But when there's work to be done, it's one for all, and all for one.

Turner, Sgt. Johnson, Sgt. Scriff. Well shoot, shoot don't wait until morning. Just planning my line of attack General. All right, go ahead and attack. OK, Hello, Captain. Hello. - Hey what are you doing? - Hello, Tommy.- Out in the rain? Business, for the taxi. Ah. Cost me over $3000, a taxi. Uh-huh. Too much English there, Captain. Tommy, did you bring the orders? Yes, Sir. This first one's marked special and urgent, sir. Hm. War department. The intelligence department again reports that enemy agents active in the vicinity of your command continue to obtain information regarding troop embarkations and other secret matters. Apparently traceable to leaks, or carelessness, within your own division. You're instructed, and so forth, to take immediate steps, and so forth... By George, this is serious. Leaks or carelessness within your own division. Secret agents, they're spies aren't they? Spies? Of course they're spies. That's the second notice, isn't it Sir. No, third, but we won't discuss it now. Tommy, issue an order that the staff meets tomorrow. Yes, Sir. I thought you said your taxi service was for enlisted men only. How does Tommy rate a ride? He's an officer you know. Yes, How about that Peg? It's after hours. And besides, Tommy doesn't count. That's right. You should stick to officers. Why? You're the general's daughter. I never forget that. That's the stuff Peg. Just the same. It's bad for the men, it weakens their moral. Giving them a ride weakens their moral? Of course. You, the General's daughter? Discipline's bad enough as it is. By the way I heard that one of the non-coms made a bet that he'd have breakfast with you. With me? A non-com? Tommy, You heard anything about this? Yes, Sir. The bet was that he'd not only eat breakfast with you within 30 days, but that you'd also serve him with, well, with patty cakes. Patty cakes? Yes, Sir. Patty cakes. Well for crying out loud. I'll be a spotted monkey. Patty cakes! General's staff meets sharp at 5. Yes, Sir. Right, Sergeant, headquarters. Captain. Well, uh, Thanks for the lift, miss. Yeah, that, that goes for me too. And me too. It was sure nice of ya. Only too happy to be of service. Oh, that service [inaudible] looks. Nevermind that crack she's a lady. I said [inaudible] looks. Thanks was enough, never mind her looks. Well, let's go fellas. Goodbye. Thanks again, and goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Yes, goodbye. Hey, what a dope I am, I forgot to get her name. Somebody kick me. She's what I call class. Yeah, up to now it's been a great war. Looks as though that guy's going to spoil it though. Yeah, Come on. Why should I tell the boys who I am? So they'll have the proper respect for you. As soon as they find out they'll be scared to death of me. And that just what you want. You're jealous. Absolutely. Ah, forget it Tommy. They're all nice boys. Well, I'm still jealous. Very funny, very funny. You're holding up the taxi service. Listen, I have some rights haven't I? No! Can I take you the rest of the trip? Oh, no thanks, I'm not going anywhere. Hey! Well, I made it. I see you did. I thought if that invitation was still open I... I'm all out of breath. I can see that, too. I'm not the runner I used to be. Since I passed 50 I seem to have slowed up. Besides, when I just looked I didn't see how pretty you were. Where do you want to go? What? I'm offering you a lift, if you'll tell me where you want to go. Oh, of course. I want to my tailors. I thought, Uncle Sam was your tailor. Officers have to outfit themselves. Are you an officer? Can't you tell by the stripes? M, hm. Honest? Uh, huh. Oh, ho, well then I'll have to explain what we Army men call insignia. You, perhaps, have seen other fellows with stripes on the shoulder? Oh, yes. Well, they're just Lieutenants and Captains, I'm a sergeant. That's very interesting. Yes, it is isn't it? Do you know the General? Know him? Ha! We're like that. You are? Sure. I like the old [inaudible]. And I suppose he likes you? Well, it's not for me to say. But, otherwise, why should he invite me over to his house all the time for meals. Oh, you eat with him? Sure, I had breakfast over there this morning. Hey, hey! Take it easy sister. Oh, I'm sorry. By the way, I hear the General has a daughter. He has. What is she like? Oh, she's a nice girl but, she looks like the General, poor thing. What's her name? Well, I call her cuddles, ha ha. Isn't this your tailor shop? Oh! Yes, it is. I, I, I don't want to im... if you're driving back I... Yes? Would you mind giving me another lift? If you'll introduce me to the General. It's a bet. Hey, Moe, where are ya? He asks me where I am. My uniform ready yet? He ask me if it's ready. How much? He ask me how much. Still $70. Shall we flip a coin? Double or nothing. Don't ask. Here we are. Signed, sealed, and delivered. Aren't enlisted men punished for wearing tailor made uniforms? Oh, no. They're only punished for getting caught wearing tailor made uniforms. Well then why take a chance. Well I'm a very lucky guy. Besides I'm having my picture taken tomorrow, for my mother. First stop in my ride for tailor made uniforms. Let me take the wheel, I haven't driven a real car since enlisted. Horses for you. I, I know the shortest cutback to camp. Aw, kind lady, let me drive. Oh, all right, get in. Well, camp again. You certainly deserve a medal for those short cuts. I'll bet we didn't go over 30 miles out of our way. Ha ha. May I? You know what I'd do if I were the General. I know what I'd do if I were the general. What? I'd order me to take a ride with you every day. I believe this is where you get out. Yes, it is. Thanks for the lift. Oh, don't mention it. I do the same for any of the boys. Oh, of course, only I. You what? Oh, nothing. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Sweet dreams. Same to you. Goodnight. Goodnight. You forgot something. Right. Your uniform. Right You know, I'm having my picture taken tomorrow.

Oh, No soul, no heart, no imagination. Goodnight my sad and lonely friend. I got the strangest feeling, when I see stars above. Just the mention of Spring and bells start to ring. It must be love.

Darling, Siberian winters had nothing on you. You know, you were the coldest proposition I think I ever knew. And I figured my chances, Oh, say, a million to one. But I to my chances.

No officers, You can take off your slicker now. Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh. Well I've looked everywhere. And there isn't an officer in the... Just my luck. Come on, let's dance anyway. We're hot. This is the car. And that's the bus all right. How about taking a look in there. OK, and I'll search this building. Deploy and cover the neighborhood. And you also sing. Oh, ho, Paul tells everything he knows. Well you's that guy is the invisible man. Yeah, well he was in there 15 minutes ago. How about camping right here in this bus. Hey! Wait here, we've got one chance. Sergeant. Hello, Eddie. How about a song? Oh no, I... Please, Bob. Well, all right. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen. I give you one of our most popular patrons, Sgt. Gray. Uh, goodnight my lucky days? Yeah. Sometimes the hour of parting calls for a tear or sigh. Sometimes it's not so easy to say goodbye. My heart is much too happy for us to part that way. I'm certain you'd rather have me just smile and say, Goodnight my lucky day. Many thanks for all the happiness you've brought me. All the millions in the world could not have bought me such joy my lucky day. Goodnight another day. Wait beyond the blue horizon for tomorrow. Who can tell it may be burdened down with sorrow. That's life, my lucky day. The way you looked when I awoke I knew my ship was in. Then from above along came love And said, How have you been? Goodnight my lucky day. Thanks again, for every moment's been a pleasure. In my heart, your memory I shall always treasure. Goodnight my lucky day. Pardon us for the intrusion, Sergeant. But the General has ordered the immediate confiscation of all slickers. We're very sorry to trouble you at a time like this. But we must have that slicker at once. Aw, listen Beans, have a heart. You can come out with us, or we'll take that slicker here. All right, I'll go outside. But I've got to give my girlfriend an alibi. OK I, uh, I have to attend to an important matter for my, uh, pals. But I'll be back. Will you excuse me? Certainly. But don't be too long. All right, Romeo. Take it off. Now, look fellas. Come on, get it! Get that slicker. Get that slicker. [inaudible] I got him. You got it? I got it. OK Attention! Sgt. Gray's compliments, Miss. The sergeant regrets his unavoidable absence for the moment, and wants you to have his coatroom check for his slicker. Hey, you! - What do you think? - What do I think? I think it's time we get out of here. Fella looks like a plant, maybe intelligence department. Better start packing right away. Hey, there! Where's your pants? Going down. I knew you were here, I saw your car out in front. Hello, Tommy. Anybody sitting here? Yes, um, no. That is, there was someone but, um... His name? I've forgotten. Good, should we dance? Never mind those plates, we won't need them. Bring the chemical box. Right away. Yes, and you better pack the camera the first thing. So, it's you again. Let me get at him. So, you let the General take your uniform, huh? Oh, I... Hey, let me go. Hey, Hey! Ugh. Woody, help! Hey! Hey! Put me down! Aw, shut up. Are you're guns ready? This guy's dangerous. Right in there. That's him! Hey, wait a minute, I'm Sgt. Gray, Headquarter's Company. Sure you are, and I'm Secondary Award. Put the braces on him. What about these two? We'll take them. I'll call Headquarters. Attention to roll call Sgt. Bennick, Sgt. Banning, Sgt. Tubbs, Sgt. Turner, Sgt. Sullivan, Sgt. Gray, Sgt. Gray, Sgt. Gray! Sgt. Schultz, Sgt. Swift, - Good morning, Sir. - Morning, Tommy. - Good morning, Peggy. - Morning. Any reports? Yes, Sir. Rather unusual. All the men of Headquarter's Company were without their uniforms yesterday. Without their uniforms? Yes, Sir. I'll answer that. Daddy, what happens to a soldier who was AWOL? Court martialed. But suppose he has a good reason? No soldier ever has a good reason. Chief of the city police on the phone, Sir. What's he want? He requests that you come to his office at once, Sir. Says they arrested three important enemy agents. Good. Says that one of them claims to be a soldier of this division. One of our men, an enemy agent? Ridiculous. The Chief seems to think it's true, Sir. Well, let me account for these leaks. Come on. Captain Burnes, meet General Markley. General. Captain is with our intelligence department, he can give you all the details. Captain the Chief tells me you have captured three very important enemy agents. Only two General, the third man is a Sergeant in Company and was the direct means of capturing the enemy agents. I was just about to release him. We can always depend on our men, in any emergency. What's his name? Sergeant Robert Gray. Sergeant Gray? Fine soldier. Splendid chap. Had my eye on him for a long time. Maloney. Bologna? I was calling my assistant, Maloney, to have Gray brought in. Never mind, I'll release Gray myself. He's entitled to it. Unlock this cell, would you please? Yes, Sir. Oh, Bob I'm so sorry. But it's all right now. Well, my daughter seems to know you, Sergeant. Why, yes, Daddy, we're old friends. Taxi Service, you know. Hm. I want to congratulate you, sergeant. You've done a fine piece of work. Um, Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. We need men like you. I'll keep you in mind for a possible promotion. Thank you, Sir. Captain, in your report to the intelligence department, don't forget to give proper credit to Sergeant Gray. Yes, Sir. Daddy, You haven't had breakfast yet, don't you think you and Tommy... Have you had breakfast, Sergeant? Not yet, Sir. Well, come on then. What's this? Check for your slicker. You're liable to need it. Come on. Seeing anything you like there, Sergeant? Sausages, and wheat cakes would do for me, Sir. I should have known it would be you, Gray. Bring me an order of those, uh, patty cakes. What do you want, Tommy? Raspberries, Sir. Attention! Hey, take a look at that! Attention! It was very kind of you, Sir, to ask me to breakfast. Don't mention it, I hope you enjoyed the patty cakes. Beg pardon, Sir? I say I hope you enjoyed the patty cakes. Oh, very much, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Sergeant, take my daughter home. Uh, as soon as she's ready. Yes, Sir. See you later Peggy. Goodbye, Dad. And we have to pay him off. The war ain't going to last that long. But you haven't left, yet. Maybe we'll still have time for roast duck at the Rivoli. Huh. I have a hunch we're leaving tonight. I'm afraid you're right. Do you mind if I sing? Do you mind if he sings? I wouldn't bet a quarter that my mental state is what it ought to be for me. The weather makes me dizzy And my head keeps buzzing like a busy bee. Oh, gee. Apparently, I'm healthy. I'm much too young to die. I've got a premonition Mr. Cupid's going to proposition me. I get the strangest feeling, when I see stars above. Just a mention of Spring. And they'll start to ring. It must be love. What is this new adventure that I keep dreaming of? When you hear symphonies and it's just the breeze, it must be love. My heart goes pitter-pat, it never did that before. Blue skies dazzle my eyes and there's a million bluebirds round my door. I'm at the gates of heaven. Just waiting on a song. When somebody can be as happy as me, it must be love. That guy is out of uniform. Will you write me, Peggy? Every day, Bob. I, I hate to say goodbye. Me, too. All right, then. What is this new adventure that I keep dreaming of? When you hear symphonies, and it' just a breeze. It must be love. What are you doing in those clothes? Having an acute attack of heart trouble. Out of uniform and AWOL, you're under arrest. Come on, come on. Blue skies dazzle my eyes and there's a million blue birds at my door. I'm at the gates of heaven, just waiting for a song. When somebody can be as happy as me, it must be love. I'll lay you five to one the General comes to my wedding. Goodnight my lucky day. Thanks again for every moments been a pleasure. In my heart your memory I shall always treasure. Goodnight, my lucky day.
