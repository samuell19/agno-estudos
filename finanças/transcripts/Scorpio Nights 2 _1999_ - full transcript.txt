Good morning, Manila! For all the June brides and grooms, this is Eric De Meric... Son of a bitch! Who fucking stole my slippers? Fuck! Susa! Oh no, I'm already late. I'll be late again! 'Cause you'll never know what may hit you... ...so listen up! Here's a cut from the comeback of a 60's balladeer... Hey, Bru-bru! Don't you have classes today? I'm already late. Your colors are gray and white. They're nice! They give you a good aura. Three months deposit, one month advance. Visiting hours are 6 PM to 8 PM, Monday to Friday from 9 AM to 9 PM on weekends. What do you think? Visitors are only allowed in the living room, not in the bedroom. Hey, hey, hey! What are you going to do with that? By the way... have you enrolled yet? I'm short in cash right now. Don't enroll in evening courses. Curfew here is at 10. If you're not in by then, you should not knock and disturb my sleep. That won't be a problem. She's already used to Manila. Look at how short her skirt is? She's used to these things. She came from another dormitory here in Manila. What? Why are you moving here? You must have an attitude problem! Goodness! I don't want a boarder who causes trouble! Of course, not! Valerie's a good girl. Don't worry. She didn't like the food there, that's all. I'm teaching you how! Listen carefully! Come here. This is debit and that is credit. Hey! It's our exam later! What's wrong with you?! Don't misbehave. Oh, I need a one day notice if you're not having meals here, otherwise, that goes to your bill even if you didn't eat here. Please watch over my baby sister. Don't let any guy visit her, especially the one named Harold. If that bastard Harold comes, give me a call immediately, okay? I'll just be staying in my office. I'll need your deposit before you start moving in. I'll be in my canteen downstairs. Thank you! The vendors in San Sebastian... Elma? Elma. Come on. Please open the door. It's already late! This place is scary. Please come visit me often. Don't be scared now. It's just really like this here. I was just like you back then. You know, in this place... no matter how annoying they are, just follow them! Remember when I left, you told me to be careful? Now, they're the ones who must be careful because of me. What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing? Ouch! Excuse me? - Hold on. Hello. - May I have everybody's attention please? Excuse me?! Silence! People, we allowed you to use this area for your registration because the school lacks space to accommodate everybody. We agreed on this request, but please... please, let's observe proper decorum here. This is still a place where people do research quietly. So please observe silence. Let us do things the civilized way. We are not savages! He's still in love with you, right? It's true anyway. You said so. No, I did not! Yes, you did! All year round, I will emerse you in the world of physics. We will study on how things react to each other. What goes on beneath the surface of these things. What makes the ball roll. What accident to make it roll. You will hear a lot of new words. We will have new meanings for the words force, gravity, tension, friction. We will know about the phenomena of nuclear fusion. How atoms are split to create powerful energy. I will introduce you to great men... and great minds. This is the basic regulation. No class card means no entry. They don't sit in your class. Miss Stregan, excuse me +for interrupting. I am attending this meeting at department level because of the problem of sexual harrassment. Yes, Butch? I can't afford to be late. I'm being very strict with the varsity team this semester. And you know how bad those jocks can be. Sit down! I'm not done, and I'm not kidding. We were all there during the seminar on teacher-student relations. At no time are we supposed to entertain a student of the opposite sex behind closed doors. Like you, Andrew. You're young, good-looking and charming. Many girls will be attracted to you. You should handle those situation with care. If I avoid them, I'm accused of being detached from my students. It would seem that I am not responsive to their problems. Once you start giving special attention to a female student, then you could be accused of taking advantage of their vulnerable nature. But we're here to teach. To reach their hearts and minds. And I won't allow any teacher to take undue advantage of his position. They gave us their full trust. And we won't take advantage of that trust. Do I make myself clear? Boys, behave! We have a guest. You'll have to excuse them. Boys are just being boys! Turn that off after using it, alright? Please don't mess around. This one's really crazy! This will be Cicero's room. It's airy and spacious isn't it? This is our cleanest room. These guys will be his boardmates. This one here is Scooter. Andrew? Andrew! This is Cicero, our new boarder. And this is his Grandpa, Dr. Katigbak. - Hi. Good evening. - How are you? Please have a seat. You should know that Andrew is a Physics professor! Is that so? - Yes, he is. - So you're a Physics professor? That's great! You can take care of my grandson then. That's why I put them in adjoining bunks, so he can take good care of Cicero. Modesty aside Professor, this grandson of mine is a certified genius! He's got an IQ of 182! that's why he's been accelerated to college and he's also a member of MENSA. College? To be honest with you, Professor, His parents were against his studying here in Manila. But it would be waste if we let him rot in the province. I'm not so sure this is the right thing to do either. But that's life. We make a decision and hope it's the right thing to do, then leave the rest to God. And hope that our good intentions bear fruit. But life's like that, I guess. You'll be here for only one semester? No. But if I like it here, I'm staying. You'll love it here. There are so many happenings. Borinaga's nice, once you get along with her. Are you in the habit of taking a bath at night? I'll wait. There's a long line for the bathroom anyway. Hey, I'm giving you a fair warning. I toss a lot in bed. I hope you get used to it so that I won't keep you awake. Have pity on me. Please? I told you, I don't have money! Stop it! You're so irritating! I won't take long. I have no money to give you! Hey! - Bye. - Eugene, put that back! Daddy? Please move me to a room of my own. It's okay if I'll pay extra! It's hard bunking with these students. I need a little privacy. Imagine, I teach them in school, then they see me here like this. And have you seen the room? It's a mess. Can't you give me the spare room since Ballesteros isn't here yet? Andrew, that room has been paid for by Ballesteros 'til the semester ends. And besides, while he's away, we're not allowed to touch anything in that room. You know how Ballesteros is, he's kind of meticulous... My goodness! - You spilled it. - I'm sorry. What are you trying to do, anyway? - I didn't mean it. - See what I mean? Look at that body, man! She's so sexy! You're really something, Valerie. You don't have to pretend. Acting as if you don't know those animals are watching you... that's so last season. Don't act so innocent. As if you don't know what I'm saying. We will be staying together in this place for a long time. It's up to you if you'll continue being a hypocrite or we'll become friends. All I know is that it pays to have friends in a jungle like this. Hey! What are you guys doing there? Don't bug us! Just finish your workout! - Get out of here! - Perverts! Get out! What's his name? My last ex? Harold. You two got caught, didn't you? That guy taught me so many things. You know when the two of you are into the same things. Like going for such extreme pleasure until something happens that will scare you. Like being in a car that's going so fast in the highway. So scary, yet so... thrilling! Instead of slowing down, you want to go faster. Because I want to discover the thrill of going over the limit. I love doing that! See, I was right from the first time I saw you. I knew you love your power over men. Are you sure? For all you know, I'm baring my body not for them, but for you. Do you know that in the future, everybody will have a credit card implanted at birth? In fact they've been trying to find an energy spot in the body to power the card. You know where they found it? In the forehead and in the palms. Doesn't it say in the Bible, "The mark of the beast will be on our forehead and our hands." That's what the Book of Revelation says. Nervous for your first day, aren't you? Do you recall how scared you were on your first day in school? Do you remember how nervous you were? I was like that too. I wanted to cry. And when highschool came, I felt like that again. It was like, "Nightmare on Elm Street". Real Horror. - But when I got to Second Year... - I didn't go through Second Year. Even First Year. I hardly went through high school. They kept giving me special examinations. Anything you have to do for the first time is scary because it is unknown to you. There, look at them. See all those sleeping faces? They all look the same. Because they're all alike. They're all scared of the same things. We're all the same. We're just older. Val? Val, wake up! Val, I'm sorry but I'm in a hurry because I have a breakfast meeting. Anyway, I brought your bathroom supplies, like the tissue paper... Val, wake up! Here's your chocolate drink. I've got cologne for you, crackers, your facial wash... I also brought your blower, walkman... There's also juice, medicine and all your toiletries. I don't owe you anything anymore! But Val, don't use it all up, these have got to last 'til term's end, okay? Oh, what else... Here, I brought milk for you. What? What happened last night? Pardon? Nothing. What was that all about? Nothing. I was dreaming. Well, anyway. Remember Mark? The Swedish F & B Manager? He's talking me to Phuket. We'll be in Thailand for two weeks, for an "observation tour". That means, vacation with pay. I don't know, maybe that guy will finally propose. What an ugly face! Look at this. Shit, he looks like a true killer! I mean, he looks like he's really up to no good. [CHATTERING] So who will go in first? Don't tell me you'll go in before me? I really have to take a pee, I think he fell asleep in the bathroom. Son of a bitch! Who's inside? Dude! Look at this shitface! Fuck this garbage! It's never-ending! My God! You're all high as hell! Hey! This is a dormitory! Not a piggery! What's wrong with you? Clean up some time! No wonder we have so many rats! Quit bitching, will you? Hey! You're also bitching around! Here, sweep the floor. How about I punch you in the face? This shameless bitch! Who's the mistress here, anyway? You or me? Dude it stinks, did you shit in your pants? My apologies. I can't take it anymore. Andrew, what's wrong with you? People are rotting outside! I'll lose my business with what you're doing! Why were my eggs not undercooked today? Well then, tomorrow, you will scramble your own egg! Are you insulting me? You bitch! What time did you go home last night? Fuck you too! Impotent! Andrew! Open up, I said! I think I'm going deaf. Dude, wait! Has everybody paid for their sausages? Hey Hermie! Let's go! Hey, Dana. You're already late. Yeah, I'll go ahead. I still have a class later. You smell good. I still smell like fish, Andrew. Andrew! I'll just brush my teeth. Dana, we shouldn't be doing that here. Okay, sir. I'll look for it then I'll give it to you personally in your office. That's how strong your appeal is to me. I'll even giftwrap it for you. Thank you. Ouch! I'll treat you at the canteen. Wait, I'll just tie these girls upside down! Ouch! You should all watch out, you girls. I'm watching you. - I'm warning you. - Why me? It's her! If I get banned from this place because of what you're doing... This isn't right! We should stop this. Left, right, left, right... Hi! Get out of the way! Sir! Your move, Sir. Your move. It's my turn? You might think I'm good at this. You don't concentrate, that's all. Checkmate. Hey, boys! Don't forget your monthly rental! That's not due until next week! I'm just reminding those who acquire amnesia when payment time comes. Hey! I mean you! Obviously, Eugene needs cash again. What's Lotta's relation to Eugene anyway? I thought you are a genius? Hi. I'm sorry, I forgot to send the book to your office. So embarrassing. I already finished the snack you sent me. You'll find the book in 2E. Really? Alright then. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good morning. You're early. The early bird catches the worm. Well, Mr. Andrew... Dana, not here. Someone might come in. You don't want to kiss? Okay. If you say so. Well, the early worm catches the bird. Dana... not here, please. So, does my breath still smell like fish? Dana... It really doesn't smell like fish anymore. Let's get on with it, Andrew. Right now. - Here? - Yes. Hurry up. Hush. Keep quiet. Enough, Jacobo. That's really funny. Sir Butch, please? Well, just because you submitted incomplete requirements last semester, now you're calling me, "Sir Butch"? Remember what you used to call me last semester? "Sir Sissy"? I'm sorry, sir. That was just a joke. You were absent for the whole term. You call that a joke? This girl forced me to marry her. She touched me... down there. Is that so? I'm sensitive down there, sir. I'm very sensitive there. So what? If you don't believe me, sir, why don't you try it yourself? I go crazy when I get touched down there. Is that true? Maybe you're just fooling me. And when will this happen? What sir? How will I find out if it's true or not? It's up to you, sir. How about later? - Wait for me at the parking lot. - Okay, sir. Oh, Andrew! Got on the wrong side of the bed, didn't we? Ms. Ordonez! You're early today. Well, like they say, "The early bird catches the worm." Dom. Dude. Are you still awake? Hey! Dom! What?! Do you remember Ms. Cinco in Accounting? Mel? Mel Cinco? Shit, yes! She's pretty. She always show her panties too! I've got a date with her. What? You have a date with her? We're seeing a movie. You're crazy! Are you suicidal? Her boyfriend is a martial arts expert! That's what's so nice about it. Don't you just love the thrill when it's forbidden? When you can get caught anytime? If you get caught, you're dead meat. Exactly! That's what excites me about forbidden thrills. That's the first time I felt such excitement. Whatever happens thrills me. I don't care what happens to me. That's the real thrill, dude. You act as if you have hotel service here! Free food, free drinks, free bed, free laundry! You think you'd just push a button, and- Voila! Free food comes out! Voila! Out comes a comfortable bed! Voila! Freshly ironed laundry! You son of a bitch! I provide all of it! It's all from me! And I'm only human! A human being! I'm not some push-button machine! I'm not some piece of furniture that you push around when it gets in your way! Do you have a brain at all?! Do you even think?! Do you have anything in that thick skull of yours aside from pleasure?! Son of a bitch, Eugenio! Don't you dare turn your back on me, you bastard! Fuck you! Drink it up! If you want to find out what's in that glass! There! Atta boy! You're great! What is it Coach Duds? No! What I'm talking about is the first time... it's as if you've been speared in you cunt! But girl, after you recover from that pain... You won't figure out where your libido is coming from! If it's coming from the lips of your vagina- But is it true that some women never get an orgasm? Orgasm? What's that? Excuse me, Ma'am. Ma'am, what's in Chapter 8? Just do your homework then we'll talk tomorrow. There! Go! What's wrong with you? How many times have I told you guys not to let your sweat dry on your clothes? Come on! Is it also my duty to dry you up? You silly girls! You better move fast! Maybe next time you'll ask me to scrub and bathe you as well. Run and chase the ball! It's up to you, guys. Oh, come on! You have to take care of your health, boys! You're a teacher, aren't you? If you get caught here, you're dead. For me, it's okay. I'm already finished with school. [GIRLS CHATTERING] Is this what you want? [GIRLS CHATTERING] No! No! Listen up! Listen up! What did I tell you guys? If you have to switch, then go ahead, switch! Is that so difficult to understand? Come on! Son of a bitch! Are your cunts so jammed with too many condoms that you can't tell anymore the difference between empty and full? It's not my fault, Coach. Don't take it on me! Now, it's vacant! Vacant means loser, a ball, zero! Now, the lane is free. Switch! That ball will go back immediately! It will go back no matter what! Hey! Fuck it! I hate it when she does that! Can someone give that woman a condom? She ruined my day! I'll just take a bath then. Are you going to St. Rose later? - What's the occasion? - It's Lita's birthday. They all think we're after only one thing! Yeah! They think all we want is sex! Yeah! Just look at Coach. She thinks we understand nothing but sex. Cicero. What's wrong with you? Didn't I tell you not to touch anything until the investigation is over? Why? What happened here? My god! The cops raided this place. They found marijuana in the medicine cabinet. Two kilos! All of you! Nobody leaves until the investigation is over! You bring me nothing but trouble, all of you! So what now? Who among you guys smoked marijuana? Whoever owns the dope better own up. Otherwise, we're all suspects. Right. Own up so we can beat you up! It's because some guys still bring guests in here even though it's not allowed. Let's not be so quick to point to outsiders. Are we all innocent here? What's a professor like you doing in a dump like this? It's kind of suspicious, isn't it? If you want to shower, you'll have to fall in line before you can use it. It's as if you're about to watch a blockbuster movie with the long line. And then? Cigarettes, sir. Sometimes gin. Every now and then, they drink around here. And most people here have asthma. I'm asking you. Not the others. I tried it once... but that was a long time ago. And I didn't liked it. It made me nauseous and I never tried it again. Are you sure? What? Speak up! I wasn't here. I was in school. And what time was that? You know, it's really hard to manage a dormitory. Me and Lota can't watch over all of them. I am always checking the bathroom but never found anything suspicious. Andrew. When this semester starts, I made it a point to be at the meeting of your department. I wanted an impression to all of you this thing about- Are you listening? Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Andrew. This is a hard thing to do for me. This is such a difficult subject to discuss. Police. What's happening to us? There are cops in our school now. This is the situation I've been trying to avoid while I'm still the Dean! I feel like I've betrayed the students' trust! I was so stupid in Butch Beltran's case. I dismissed it as gossip. But oh my God, it turned out to be true! In exchange for passing grades, he was soliciting sex from students! Can you imagine that? Sex with students?! - See you tomorrow! - Yes. - See you tomorrow! - Thank you for this. When an object is in motion, and it continues moving at a constant velocity, it's because of the power of inertia. Unless... and this is very important. A foreign object gets in the motion's path. If that's the case, both trajectory and speed of the moving object will change. Because the foreign object and the object it hit, will have applied its own force. You've changed so much. You are so different now. It seems that no one knows the Andrew you were before. Ms. Stregan doesn't know you anymore. As for me? I don't know if I still know you. What's wrong, Andrew? Can I help you in this? You know I believe in you. There's something about you that says you can achieve great things. You have a different style in doing difficult things. You have the talent of being in control. At any situation, you are always in control. There's no one but you. What do we do now? What's there to do? We'll just smell each other's scent. According to Keppler, the closer the planet is to the sun, the faster its orbit. The farther a planet is, the slower its orbit and rotation. Like this one. If fire is the force of the sun, and the water are the planets of the sun. The heat acts fastest upon the closest objects. I'm so mad! Shit! I was really, really angry! I was really, really furious! The nerve to try to manipulate me! He claims he took pity on Jacobo, that's why he did what he did. What does he think of me? Stupid? No. Butch really crossed the line. What do you know about it? I was there when he made his assignation with Jacobo. I heard it. They didn't know I was there. And you didn't report it? Anyway, I can't blame you. Those are just difficult to deal with. Even to me. When I think of all the good things Butch have done for this school... I really don't know anymore, Andrew. Well... it's been a pleasure working with all of you. A bunch of fine outstanding, competent professionals. I'm sure, I'll cross paths with some of you one day. After all, Some of us are walking through the same path. Andrew! Andrew, are you- Ms. Duds saw you with a student in a Chinese restaurant. Is this true? I will not acknowledge that question. I've already been insulted and yet you still ask me that question. Because of a sick question of a sick mind from a fucking sick school! And I'm not sick to answer that question. Damn you, Andrew! She's only 17. That's statutory rape. You might think it's nothing and just a fling. But as far as I'm concerned, for the school and the law, it's a crime! If you're proven guilty, It's punishable by death! Let's put an end to this. Innocent people are getting involved. Even my job's getting affected. Isn't this driving you mad? So that's it then? You'll just break up with me? We're through? Just like that? As if nothing happened? I can't allow that to happen. Please listen. You're not listening. I'm stopping this right now, not only for myself, but for your sake, too. There's nothing we can do. This has gone too far. Now it seems I can't take any form of responsibility. I won't hide from you. If I intended on abandoning you, would I be talking to you now? Exactly! You pretend to talk to me and yet you've already made a decision. If you want to leave, fine! Get out! We're through! Lota, it's up to you. It's about time you start taking care of yourself. You should stop killing yourself for Eugene. That's all we can advice to you, as your friend. You know what, Lota? Maybe you're just after the sex. Like you said, we're all just horny. But the real issue here is whether it's normal for us to indulge our desire or not. To us, what you're doing is not normal. You've been torturing yourself too much. We're not talking about love here. To some people, fucking is just fucking. Love is love. But it's up to you if you'll suffer for that fucking Eugene! Courtesy of the Scandinavian FMB. These fucking men. Why are we such suckers for them? We believe everything they say, especially if they're white. That's you, Mona. I'm not like that. Easy. You should take it easy. You don't look so good. You know your aura now really doesn't look that good. You know, Mercury is in retrograde right now. The house of Scorpio is steaming with reversals. Now people are undergoing emotional upheavals. I want to go home, Grandpa. I already hate college. I'm the only kid there. In school, it's like being a sideshow in some circus. "Come see Cicero! Watch the boy genius!" "do his tricks with Spiderwoman, the three-legged woman!" "And Gamuka, watch him eat a live chicken!" Don't break my heart, grandson. A little sacrifice is all I ask from you. The Lord won't forsake you. You can do it. You can do it, grandson. Remember, noise is okay. Just no... No barfing, no fighting, no fucking! Piece of cake, man! Fuck you, Doms! You cheated! You kicked me! - Tough luck. You're so frail! - Go take a rest. I'll handle this. Turn off the lights! This is going to be a different fight. So what now? Hit me! Shit, dude! Son of a- Andrew! Wake up. You have a visitor. Andrew! Shit, this place is a stinking mess! All of you always make a mess out of everything! I didn't see you in school earlier. I got worried. That's why I came here. Why? What time is it? What's happening to us? Dana, excuse me. But I'm running late already. You're driving me out? Dana. This has nothing to do with you, or with us. It is just with me. How... what do you mean just with you? Sometimes... I wonder if it has something to do with you. Since you're the one that started this. I had an ordinary life back then, go to school, teach, study, sleep. It was so ordinary. So boring, thinking of it now. But that day, in the faculty room. It was only then that I felt that kind of excitement. It's like it changed me forever. My God. I'm scared where this would lead me. But I really want to see where this would take me. That's why I'm so happy now. If you're so happy, then why do you look like that? You look miserable. Take a look at yourself. You're so dirty. Only thing left for you to do is to pick up bottles and garbage. That's why I have made the decision. That I should have made long ago. That's why I'm happy now. Suit yourself. But just in case you change your mind, I'm just here. Hello? Hello... Valerie? Val! Valerie's not here! If you're busy, I'll take care of it! How do I tell the girl that I want to... you know? The girl knows that, stupid! [CHATTERING] Cicero, dude? Hey! If you don't want to, just tell them. They can't force you anyway. I don't need your help! You have no idea about this! You're an expert on physics, but when it comes to real people, you're as dumb as I am! We all have our own burdens in life, Cicero. We each have our own crosses to bear. Cicero! Why do you say things to me like that? You're the one who's got a problem. You should be helping me! Am I right? You don't understand. That's why you don't know. I know! You think nobody knows? Everybody knows you've gone nuts over that girl! You should be ashamed of yourself. That girl is only a little older than I am! You're the type of person that should be feared. You're the lion who eats the monkeys entrusted in your care. Make sure you give it back, okay? - Have you got any acetone? - Yes I have. Is this not empty yet? Can I borrow this? - Sure. - Just give it back. What color do you want? Excuse me, miss? Where's Valerie? Valerie Martin? Hey, hey! We recognize you! Have you no self respect at all? You're a teacher! Valerie personally asked me not to welcome you here! Let me explain. Explain all you want! If you don't leave, I'll call the cops! Leave! You're a pig! An abuser! Let's see if you can fool Captain Ortega! I will send you to jail! Pervert! I can't understand why all of you are having a hard time! All you have to do is understand every word! Think! What goes up must come down! Down, down, down! Fuck you, Andrew! She's only 17! That's statutory rape! If you're proven guilty, it's punishable by death! I'm stopping this right now- not only for myself, but for your sake, too. If you want to leave, fine! Get out! We're through! You're the type of person that should be feared. You're the lion who eats the monkeys entrusted in your care. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday! What are you doing here? Do you know that you're prohibited here? If Borinaga catches you, you're dead meat. That's enough, Valerie. I know you've been waiting to see me. Let's stop this madness once and for all. I knew it! You're really horny, Valerie. You guys are weird! That's enough! You son of a bitch! What the hell are you doing here? Get the fuck out! Don't! You animal! Let go of me! Don't let him get away! Get him! That's enough! Get him! That's enough! Cicero? Cicero? Cicero? Cicero? Hey... Shit, what did Andrew do to Cicero? That son of a bitch! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But I did nothing to Cicero. Valerie? Where's Valerie? Valerie? Valerie? Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Tomorrow, let's celebrate the nearing Halloween. We have a special treat for everyone. One bloody party for all you creatures of the night. As followers of darkness sharpen their fangs and focus their bloodshot eyes on their weak victims this coming November 1 in Firestorm of Blood. Here's a bloody cut from Tendrils and Stems.
