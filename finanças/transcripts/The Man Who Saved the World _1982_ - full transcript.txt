The Space Age began when man took his first steps toward the stars. It was a time of rapid progress for the people of Earth. This period lasted for thousands of years. Eventually the Space Age gave way to a new Galactic Age. Thousands more years went by, and the Solar System became part of a larger Galactic System. Histories and civilizations faded into memory, and man adopted a simpler life as it had in ancient times. Then humanity began a relentless search for the secret of immortality. Borders between nations, races, and religions dissolved, for the people of the Galactic Age shared a common way of life. And yet, due to nuclear armament, Earth teetered on the brink of destruction. The Earth had faced such peril before, and it had always prevailed. But finally, inevitably, the planet splintered. Fragments broke off from Earth, becoming asteroids. On some of these new planets, life survived. But still nuclear war escalated. After Earth's devastation, its leaders amassed ever greater power. Yet before long a terrible new enemy, invisible, confronted mankind. An alien force ceaselessly bombarded the Earth... with the most powerful laser weapons in the universe. Who was this new foe? From what galaxy did it come? Mankind banded together to develop a defense against the attacks. It constructed an organic shield using the power of the human brain. This barrier, composed of compressed brain cells, insulated the planet. The ravaged Earth choked in dense clouds of dust, but it survived. Only another weapon made of human brain power could penetrate the shield. And Earth's enemy, despite its destructive weapons, did not possess such a brain. The resources of Earth and its people proved superior. Man began to search the cosmos for its mysterious enemy. Unfortunately, no pilot sent out ever returned. Earth's civilizations were desperate for a solution. Their only option was to discover the enemy's base and destroy it. Many, including two of the greatest Turkish soldiers... joined the war against the unknown enemy. Some did not join the fight, but anyone with sense and imagination... was determined to enlist. The Earth is at its weakest point. It should be easy to conquer. But still they resist. I do not understand. It must be the power of the human brain. If I can acquire a single Earthling brain, I can conquer their planet. The time for our assault has come. Battleships, await my command! Typhoon-1 to base. Ascending. Typhoon-2 ascending as well, Murat. Careful Ali, here they come. Dropping altitude. There's one on your tail. Thanks, buddy. Here we go, watch yourself. Nice shooting. We must penetrate the layer protecting the Earth. Destroy the Earth! It's as if the Earthlings are using magic. There's no end to these guys. They're advancing in swarms. So let's take the fight to them. That's more our style. We need to build up some speed. Prepare for more incoming. What a bunch of sourpusses. I'd prefer chicks in mini-skirts. They have learned to convert their brainpower into energy. If I can capture a single brain, I can conquer their Whole world. We're being drawn away by some invisible force. We're too far from Earth. The displays are malfunctioning. I can't get a reading. This is getting dicey. Be careful. Earth, I have not yet conquered you, but that doesn't mean I've lost. We're getting further away from Earth. We can't escape this pull. Typhoon-2, come in! Typhoon-2! Typhoon-2, respond! Typhoon-2, respond! You have thwarted me again, Earth. But nothing will save you next time. Then I will be the most powerful being in the cosmos. Where are we? I don't know. We'd better figure out Where we are. Otherwise we'll die of hunger and thirst. I'm dead tired. Let's rest a minute. That's just What they want. Once we stop, we're done for. What would you say if I said I was afraid? - Be afraid, but don't show it. - Why not? Maybe we crashed on a planet inhabited only by women. They might be testing us to see which one of us is braver. Then I'll take the lead. Don't forget to puff out your chest. Here they discovered records of many nations, eras, and civilizations. Millions of years ago they too faced an invincible enemy. But how did it end? It was a hell of a battle. I remember an explosion and then nothing. How did we crash here? We have no ship, no weapons... nothing. We didn't crash. They forced us down. I told you we were being drawn in by some mysterious force. Well, here we are. Let's see What fate has in store. Here were depictions of evil and death. They resembled modern nuclear weapons. They must have lived in an advanced atomic age. Perhaps they were eradicated during a nuclear war. Would Earth be further destroyed by pointless nuclear conflict? - Do you think it's true, What you said? - What? A planet inhabited only by women? Why not? Wouldn't it be great if we had champagne and music too? So start your famous Whistle that no woman can resist. - You must have whistled the wrong tune. - Why? We got skeletons instead of women. What are they? They look so strange. Probably not your lovers from Earth. It seems we've been caught. Very observant. How'd you get so smart? Combatants, if you Win, you live. This is death sport. Lose, and your deaths will please our master. Your blood supplies our master with youth and happiness. Prepare to fight. Looks like some kind of circus. This has to be a bad dream. Somebody wake me up. I think we're about to be put to sleep permanently, Without even a lullaby. The weak ones will die. The Galactic Age will be the age of my immortality. Give me back my son! Take me instead! Leave my child! - What are we waiting for? - What do you want to do? Fight oppression! Seize them. Seize the humans. Earthling blood! Earthlings! The ones I have been waiting for. Earthlings! Earthlings! Earthlings! Seize them. Don't let them escape. This way, sir! This way! Hurry! They'll come back. They're looking for me. - They're afraid of something. - But they're treating us well. Your good looks make them nervous. Can't you ever be serious? Do you know Why the nuclear war that almost destroyed our world began? Why? People were too serious. Too much can be dangerous. If they had known a little about laughter, they'd have chosen peace instead of war. Then I'll laugh and turn this hell into heaven. Nothing changed. It will. They're being cautious. When they're ready, they'll approach us. They're inside, sir. If they're not tricks of the Wizard, they may be our salvation. Come. Who are you? Just an old man. A pious old philosopher. You must learn from the past to move toward the future. This is the key to universal Wisdom. You carry weapons. I carry knowledge. We are alike. We are human. Did you find What you were looking for? You know What we're looking for? Yes. You were once a mechanical people with advanced technology. Here you discovered your history, the glorious civilization of your ancestors. Yes, we saw those ruins. But their civilization looked far more advanced than ours. And they used their technology not to destroy each other, but for the benefit of all mankind. They had faith. Optimism. And they were all brothers. Because they were all from the same tribe. The 13th tribe! The 13th tribe? That's the tribe of our ancestors. Then which part of Earth is this? This is a land of eternity, full of darkness and secrets. Thousands of years ago, Earth was splintered by the first atomic war. Everything became rock... and scattered into the void. This place is a fragment of Earth. And its ruler, the Wizard, is poised to conquer your home world. Now that you have arrived, he will never leave us in peace. These people's lives are in danger. Our enemy is here? Then we'll stay. Our final battle with evil has begun. I have not forgotten you, Earth. Now fortune favors me. I have waited one thousand space years to destroy you. You cannot find me, but I can always find you. Very soon you will be mine. You stand before me... and you will be destroyed. You will be destroyed! You will be destroyed! I hate waiting around. Something needs to happen. Let's find out What's going to happen. How do we do that? We'll look. Come on. Come, quickly! This way! Get in! Hurry! Get in! Quick, quick! Close the door! Stand back! I saw your strength out there. Only you can save us. In order to take on the Wizard, you must toughen your body and mind. My daughter will show you the way out. Take them to the green valley. You have failed. You have failed! You could not bring me the Earthlings. You will be destroyed! I created you, and I will destroy you. Destroy! Destroy! Your immortality will not save you. You will learn not to disobey. Only Dragon can defeat the Earthlings. On Earth, mankind came from dust, and to dust it shall return. Dragon, too, came from the dust, but he is stronger than any man. My creature. No one in the universe dares oppose me. Do my bidding. Find those Earthlings and bring them to me! Remember, you are human. Humans should only use their power to destroy evil. - I'm so hungry. - Sister made dinner. - What are we having? - Fried bugs and boiled snake. I can't eat that! If you don't eat you might lose your good looks. You aided the Earthlings. For that you shall be punished. You shall become the living dead. We'll meet again. You mean a great deal to me. I'll be back. - She's fallen in love with you. - No, it's something deeper. She's discovered her humanity. Leave me alone! Let me go! I said leave me alone! Do not approach. You cannot reach me. I am one. But if I Wish, I can become legion. I am here. I am everywhere. Or nowhere. I am immortal. I embody mankind's anger, hatred, and vengeance. My power is limitless. I possess all the power that has accumulated since life began. You Earthlings survived, though your ships were destroyed in flight. Vaporized. You are only alive because of me. I brought you here. I have a plan for you. With your help, I will conquer the Earth. In thousands of years, nothing has ever escaped my almighty grasp. I always get What I want. The Earth too shall be mine. Just like these two. You humans. You cannot deny your emotions, your conscience. Your hearts bleed for this beautiful girl and poor child, and this is my weapon against you. I will exploit your mercy, love, compassion, and humanity! For now they are my guests. You, too, are invited to my palace. We began as enemies, but I hope that we will soon become friends. It would be rude to refuse such a polite invitation. Let's go. This place is great. They're so friendly. They even gave us these Carnival getups. Let's see how this plays out. We came here by choice, but now we need to focus on our objective. With the secret of those Earthlings' brains, I can crush the resistance. We must break their will. That is your task, 0 Queen. Our master Wishes to see the Earthling. Our master Wishes to see the Earthling. Our master Wishes to see the Earthling. - Earthling, our master Wishes to see you. - Hm? Me? Yes, you. Just my luck. I always get the tin men. Looks like you'll get the girls. Stop talking. Walk. Watch it, shorty. You're hurting me. Stop talking. Walk. Stop talking. Walk. I am queen of this planet. I Wished to meet with you in private. Good idea. I finally get to look at a beautiful woman. Surely women on Earth are more beautiful. You and the Wizard have Earth on the brain. What do you want with Earth? We must discover the secret of the human brain's Willpower. You and I could be the most powerful couple on Earth. Where does the power and resistance of the human brain come from? So you're going to seduce me into talking? I just want to get to know you better. Only the women on Earth get to know me better. Forget about the Earth for now. Welcome to the land of darkness, secrets, and eternity. You have seen my limitless power. Join me, and let us rule the Earth and all the stars together. No. I won't join you. We will defeat you. I am undefeatable. My power is beyond comprehension. You will be defeated. Because you're afraid. This planet is imbued with the faith of our ancestors. When that power combines with ours, you'll be all alone with your darkness and secrets... in an eternal void. You're evil. A scourge. And good always prevails over evil. How do you think you'll defeat me? I know there's a limit to your power. We'll find it. You have seen mere physical trifles. Your ancestors' Wisdom and power? Here it is! My real strength is intangible. Once I extract your brain as well, the Earth and the cosmos shall be mine. That is my secret weapon. Time will tell. Time has no meaning here. We exist beyond time. We are immortal. I am one thousand years old. And mine is a physical immortality, not merely a spiritual one. These ones too shall become immortal. Bring them! Now take them away! I said take them away! Let go of us! Let them go! Let them go! You are powerless. You made too much noise. Her husband showed up. I wondered What tore you away. Shoot them! Shoot them! Shoot him! I have them. Now it is my turn. What, they resisted? The earth gives rest to the dead. But the greatest torture for the living is to be buried alive. No man can Withstand this ordeal. Free your spirit from your body, and you can breathe underground. They cannot Withstand this torture. No matter how strong they are, they will perish in the earth. They cannot Withstand this torture. They survived! Take them to the arena and teach them humility. Once we break their spirit, their brains will be more malleable. No one in the cosmos can stand against me! This is a battle of intellects. I couldn't break the Earthling's will. You failed, 0 Queen. They are powerful beyond immortality. More powerful than you. Only their brains. You could not bring me the Earthling's brain, 0 Queen. Forgive me. You will be destroyed. You will be destroyed! You will be destroyed! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I will harvest his brain and increase my power. Ali's capture has bought me some time. This is my last chance to defeat the Wizard. My son, this is the mausoleum of Haji Bektash Veli. It is a shrine that broke off from Earth a thousand space years ago. As the most deeply-rooted community on Earth... Islam, your religion, is the epitome of civilization. Islam, founded by Muhammad, the last prophet, has been a beacon for righteousness and humanity for centuries. Every Muslim is a messenger of Islam and a defender of the faith. When sinners strayed from their faith and from God, wars broke out and Earth became a target for all evil in the cosmos. Your holy book the Qur'an, embraced by Muslims and read for centuries, explains the world, the universe, the stages of human civilization, and all creatures that ever existed, from the beginning until doomsday. The book teaches that man should believe in his death... as he believes in his birth. Death and immortality. After the Earth splintered... the 13th tribe came upon a bronze mountain. This high peak protected them from the effects of radiation. They melted down the mountain and forged a sword containing its power. Then they traveled to the plains, Where Wise men gathered. They concentrated the goodness, Wisdom, and brainpower of all mankind... into a single brain. The sword and brain remained on this planet, which was once part of Earth. We are all that remains of the 13th tribe, along with the Wizard and his immortals. My daughter has not spoken since the day I hid the brain and the sword. She will take you to them, my son. You must overcome many obstacles to reach them. When heretics began slaughtering the faithful, they fled far away. They built cities seven levels underground and fought the heretics. Jesus was their guide. The cities they established thousands of meters underground... were the products of an advanced technology. They lived and multiplied. Many travelers passed through their country. There the pilgrims learned that there is only one God. Although Christianity recognizes only one God, the quest for immortality, inherited from the polytheistic Mayans and Aztecs, continued unabated. The most powerful sovereign at that time was the Wizard. He eventually discovered the secret to immortality. For him, immortality was the ultimate power. He tortured and oppressed his subjects. And using his advanced knowledge, he drained their blood to increase his immortality. The Wizard and his followers were immortal. They grew older and uglier, but they would not die. This is the truth. The Wizard desires revenge upon the Earth. It is his sole ambition. You did it! That's the first time you've spoken. I was sworn to silence until the brain and sword were held by mortal hands. I had to keep them secret. Ali! My dear friend. I'm so relieved. One of the Wizard's tricks. He will try to harvest your friend's brain. It's me he really wants. And I'd hate to keep him waiting. Earthling, with your brainpower, I will become omnipotent. We cannot complete the brain transfer. His mind is not free. His thoughts, will, and psyche link him to the other Earthling. He is bound to his friend with his entire being. We cannot acquire his brainpower. Impossible! We cannot acquire his brainpower. His mind is not free. His thoughts, will, and psyche link him to the other Earthling. That Earthling tricked me! Deceived me! He intentionally allowed his friend to be caught. Attention. Attention. The Earthlings have escaped. Capture them. The Earthlings have escaped. Give me that sword. I'll chop them all into pieces. They're only puppets. We have to find that devil, the Wizard. That's What you think. I'll use my strength. I'm afraid your strength will get you into as much trouble as your charm. Don't get smart. If you had brains, you'd stick to champagne and women. Well, I'm no angel. You're always wasting time. Earth's survival is in our hands. If we make a mistake it will be destroyed. Who do you think you are? The man who saves the world? No more than you fancy yourself a ladies' man. If Earth is destroyed, there'll be no more women. What would you do Without them? The women here are enough for me. Only a fool would want women with monsters for husbands. I know What I'm doing! Give me that! You did well, coming to me. Teach me the secret to unite these two powers. I'll take care of the Wizard. And you will succeed, my son. The secret is... The Wizard has touched the brain and the sword. He has What he wanted. Now he has the power to destroy the Earth. Save... the world. Save the world. Save the world! Oh, mortal humans! I have touched the sword and the brain. I also took the power of that dead sage. Now you cannot stop me. I will imprison you here for eternity. Time is nothing to me. But you shall not last long. You will weaken... and be extinguished. I know you blame me. I gave the power to the Wizard. And the old man died because of me. I will avenge him! Stop! Ali! Ali! I suppose I'm a fool. If you were, you wouldn't have so many women chasing after you. You're too kind. I love you very much. I only Wish my girlfriend back home loved me as much. Women don't speak about their love. Tell them... that I love them all. You can tell them yourself when we get back. I don't think I'm going to make it. Don't pull that dying act. You know I won't fall for it. I know, you can't be fooled easily. Just for you, I won't die. These tears represent the glory of mortal man. His love, his hope, his loyalty, his faith. The Wicked don't understand the power of tears, nor can they know the reckoning that awaits them when the tears have dried. Take them away. Take them away. This is the moment I have been waiting for. Our computers await your orders, sir. I am the strongest. Initiating countdown. - 10, 9, 8... - The Earth will be destroyed. 7, 6, 5... Destroy the Earth! Attention all humans. Attention all humans. The enemy is approaching. Annihilate! Destroy! Destroy the Earth! Kill every human! Stop! Let us go! I am invincible. In order to save his world, the Earthling must destroy me. The Earth will be destroyed. The Earth will be mine. Attack the Earth! Make them suffer as I suffered for a thousand years. The Earthling cannot defeat me. I will destroy that Earthling, no matter how strong he is. Hooray! Hooray! Farewell, Earth man! Farewell! I love you both very much. Are you leaving? Yes, I'm returning to my world, Where evil can no longer dwell. Farewell, Earth man! There can be no world without people, nor people without a world. Humanity is the most precious resource in the universe. Protect your future... for the future depends on peace. And have no doubt, mankind will ensure that peace. THE END
