You can come in now. What do you think? It's fine. The maps are good. There are more pictures. But they don't mention a hotel I liked. Which one? The one with the waterfalls. Sure, but that doesn't mean it isn't there anymore. I know. Right. I haven't filled the bathtub right up, but you can use the showerhead to rinse off. OK? I will leave the razor here. Would you like that? Right... We are going to get the fire going. Come down when you are ready. And put your pajamas in the basket, we will wash them later. See you in a minute. You two came early. Nathan was too excited. And as I hadn't' heard from Laurent, I thought I would take the other car. Maybe I should have phoned. -Is he very busy these days? -Too busy. Sometimes he will call at 7 p.m. to say he won't be home. We can never be sure. Laurent has always been committed. It is one of his best qualities. Providing he doesn't overdo it. -It is hard for Nathan, too. -I understand. Hard to blame someone so devoted, though. I will go. It is probably Caroline. I wanted to give you a bunch of little hints. Well, you better tell us before dessert! -Is Gaëtan with you? -He is coming. He is in the car. -How are you doing? -Good. You got me all in a fluster by not giving me a heads-up. I'm sorry, Mom. But... -How is Cédric? -Obsessed by this trip of his. Great. So he is going then? I have a little something for him. But it can wait if you like. -Cyrielle, you are here! -How are you? Great. Is Laurent here? -Not yet. He is coming later. -Oh no! When? Don't start, Caroline. Laurent works very hard. Yeah, but it is almost impossible to get us all under one roof. Your brother has a life you know, particularly if you only call at the last minute. Is the little one here? Hello, boys. Come here, little man. -Did you miss me? -Yes. -How much? -So much! Wow, you are big! Stop growing. Did you miss me, too? Sorry. Here we are! We are going to be drunk as skunks! That is one bottle per person! -How are you? -Good. We don't have to drink all of it, Mom! -How are you? -Good, you? Good. Isn't Laurent with you? -No. I have already complained. -Yes, and that is quite enough. -Shall we eat outside? -Won't we be cold? We should make the most of it while the weather is still nice. I will bring the bottles out. What can I do to help? How are you, Alain? Here, look what I brought. -Ah, a Saint Estèphe. -Yeah. Mom. Cédric, what are you doing? Come, and say hello! Were you planning on staying out there all day? No, I just came down. How are you? Fine. Well, I'm fine, too. -How about you, Cyrielle? -Yeah, fine. Great. Everyone is fine. Let me have a look. That is good, you look nice and smart. Did you shave? I got something for you, in my bag on the bench. AUSTRIA Thank you. Don't you like it? Do you want to give us a hand? Dad said to join him when I was ready. Good. Then put the book down and bring him some plates, please. Is that the one you wanted? Do you like it? Hi, Cédric. Thank you, you can put them down. Did you say hello to Gaëtan? Hi. I was starting to think you were ignoring me! -How are you? -Fine. Is work good? Yeah. Right, who wants to try some? Alain? Cédric, go and get Nathan. He has been in the woods too long. I'm worried he will get lost. Don't you want to go? Hurry back. He won't go on that trip. Your father planned it all out without consulting me. Cédric just isn't capable. Things are hard enough as it is. Come on, Mom. It is only Austria! What is the worst that can happen? And Dad will be with him. Unbelievable. No matter what I say, I am always the bad guy. Even though I am the one who has been helping him pack and repack his case. At least it is keeping him occupied! Yes, it has given us a bit of a break. Can you wash this, too, please, my dear? As long as he doesn't freak out, I'm fine. Nathan? Nathan? You have to tie it tight. Like this. Careful. Don't run, or you will trip and hurt your hands. So, no running, OK? Wait. I made another pile over here. We have enough here. Don't run off. Mommy will be cross. It is just over here. The wine is great. Help yourselves. Just give me five minutes to go and freshen up. You look fine, Mom. Come on, let's go into the garden. I want to wear something nice. I will be quick, promise. Anything we can do in the meantime? Keep an eye on the rice. I will be right back. It is not easy with your father. How come? I don't know. I try to talk to him, but he isn't giving me much. He is just concentrating on the fire. Nathan, wait for me. What are you doing? I don't know. Trying to be nice, make small-talk. Don't be so hard on yourself. No one expects you to be best friends. Just be natural. I am, but that is not the point. He is very tense. You are just being paranoid. Cyrielle? Nathan? Nathan? Nathan! Mommy! It is OK, come on. Where is your shoelace? Never mind. Come on. Let us go and clean this up. Calm down. Nathan, what is wrong? Nothing. He just fell over. We will clean it off in the kitchen. Come on, buddy, be a brave boy. What on earth were you thinking, going off into the woods with Nathan? Hm? You are the adult, remember? Come here. What did you want to tell me earlier? Is the orange juice on the table? I don't know. Then, check. Open the fridge, and if it isn't there, then it is on the table. I heard that it was up to the age of five that kids... -kids develop a good musical ear. -Really? Yeah, because it is the time when you are the most open to learning. Do you want some, Cyrielle? It is much easier. Here you go, buddy. It is never too late to learn. Well, yeah, but it is easier. Does it still hurt? It is my fault, not yours. I told you: don't run. -Right. Everyone got some wine? -Yes, I think so. There is one missing. No, it is mine. I am having juice. Why? You love wine. You have some every time. It is a good bottle, a Phélan Ségur Saint-Estèphe. Yeah, I know. Gaëtan bought it. Mind your own business. Here. -Dad, are you ready? -Coming. Right, have we got everything? Who is going to light the candles? I will. Alain, are you coming? We are waiting for you. I'm here. -Shall we? -Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. That is a beautiful dress, Mom. See? I told you it was worth me changing. -It is much better. -Well, you look very pretty. Your father bought it for me. See? Not all men have bad taste. -Take notes. -That is not fair! I will be taking a makeover class tomorrow, Alain! I don't need a makeover, but it is nice to get a new dress now and again. Don't worry. We men are naturally beautiful. -Exactly. -Listen to those two! If I knew we were dressing up, I would have worn a shirt! What are you waiting for? Eat, eat! -Should I start cooking the meat? -Let's wait a bit. Hands on the table. -It is delicious. -Yes, very good. Thank these two. I couldn't have done it without my two little helpers. What is wrong? You are being weird. I'm not being weird, I'm fine. -Are you warm enough? -Yeah. He is a tough cookie. Yes. He was very helpful with the wood, weren't you? OK, I can't wait anymore. I'm not waiting for people who are tardy. Do you want to know why I'm being weird? Here you go, Mom. For me? Not exactly. Open it! -If this is some sort of joke... -Just open it. Oh, darling! I'm so happy for you! I'm so, so happy! Don't tell me you hadn't guessed. Of course, I knew. I told you. Too many hints! Hints or not hints, I know my baby too well. -Congratulations, my love. -Thanks, Dad. -You're pregnant? -Yeah, dummy! Why didn't you say straight away? Because it was a surprise, Cédric! He thought it was odd she wasn't drinking. I was hoping Laurent would have turned up, but... You got me with the envelope though! I thought it was a gift card. See? He thought it was too obvious. It is what everyone does. Don't worry, it was a very good plan! Congratulations. Thank you, Alain. -See those two little crosses? -Congratulations. Where? The little white crosses there and there? -See? -Yeah. You see that shadowy bit in between those white crosses? That is the baby in my tummy. You used to be like that in Mommy's tummy too. Cédric, do you want to go upstairs a bit? How is it? At the moment? Good. Good, I think. Can I see? Of course. Come here. It is good news, remember? Are you happy for me? What about you, Nathan? You're going to have a little cousin. -A boy or a girl. -I want it to be a surprise. You didn't want me, did you, Mom? Cédric! Why on earth would you say that? -You didn't. You told me. -Nonsense, I never said that! And it is not true, anyway. I still have a lot of Nathan's toys and clothes if you like. If you have a boy, that is. Oh yeah, that would be great! I have kept a lot of things too! I gave some of them to Laurent for Nathan, but I still have loads of boxes in the attic. But that stuff is really outdated now. I don't want my child to be dressed like the Waltons! Don't be silly. There is nothing wrong with them. And think of all the money you would save! Oh, trust me, she isn't too worried about that! Hey! That is not fair. What is that weird thing? That is the umbilical cord, or something like that. Ah, right. We are thinking of moving. Really? Any idea where you would go? I would like a house with a garden. Some friends of ours are moving, their apartment is on the ground floor, and it has a lovely garden. Oh no, not the ground floor. That is really dangerous in a city. Yes, but you won't find a garden on the third floor, Caroline. That is why we are thinking of getting a house. There will still be a ground floor, though. Aren't you worried about having a kid? A little, yes. So, I'm counting on you to help me, OK? Really? I was wondering... Do you feel ready? You are never truly ready. -You could get an abortion. -Are you serious? Cédric, Caroline. Did you hear what he said? I'm asking for them, Mom. So they are not unhappy. I wasn't trying to be mean. Then, just be happy for me, and shut up, OK? And you are drinking. I saw you have a drink. Caroline, he is just being silly. -Calm down. -Why are you taking his side? I'm not. That is enough, you two. You are acting like children! And what about your trip? We are waiting to see what the doctor says. It is stressing me out at the moment. Plus, financially speaking... Come on, Caroline, my parents offered to help. And we can help, too. Right, Alain? We did with Laurent. That is kind. We will see. You are lucky. I'm going on a trip soon too. It is gonna be awesome. I am ready. We will see. Nothing has been decided yet. -Still nothing from Laurent? -No. Caroline, let's go and take a quick look at those boxes. The Hudson mountain range... Ellmau... Innsbruck... The frozen lakes... Lunersee... I thought you said he was better? He is being such a pain! He will calm down. He is just thrown by the news. Surely you can understand that. I don't know how you and Dad manage. We just do, Caroline. We just do. Wouldn't you and Dad like a break now and again, just the two of you? You have no life anymore. Look at Dad, he is completely shut off. We didn't ask for your advice, thank you. You will understand in a few years. And your father is fine. Whatever. Do what you like. I just want us all to have a nice night. A little help, please, Caroline! I'm having another glass. Alain? Yeah? Shall I top you up? -Yes, put it in my glass. -OK. Are you OK? Here. / Are you sure you have had enough to eat? You need to eat up if you want to be strong. / Have you found anything? More or less. Aren't Cédric's things here? Your brother never gets rid of anything. It's all still in his room. I'm going back down with the others. Come and join us later. Aren't you going to look with me? Too much excitement tonight. We can go through them calmly later, alright? What's wrong? Stop wriggling about and tell me. What do you want? -What's wrong, Nathan? -I don't know, he won't say. Are you tired? Hungry? I'm thirsty. -Where is your glass? -What have you done with it? Have you dropped it on the ground or something? Alain, can we borrow your torch, please? Have you lost something? No, Nathan has dropped his glass on the ground. Is this a new game of yours? Cyrielle... Come on, let's go and get you another glass. Are you leaving? I'm taking Nathan home to bed, he is exhausted. I will come back with Laurent. Can't you get him to sleep here? Wait for Laurent with us. Call him, so we know when he is coming. He isn't picking up. Try again. Please. Are you feeling tired, buddy? No, I'm OK. Look what I found for you. -Do you like it? -Yeah. -Are you bothering Mommy? -I lost my glass. Do you think that is why everyone is in a bad mood? I think it is starting to rain. Perhaps we should go in. It might just be a few drops. / What are you doing here, all on your own? Cédric, come in, now. Are you OK? Are you having a nice evening? Here. Thanks. How are you feeling? Do you still want to go on your trip? OK, listen... Play along. Be polite. Don't upset anyone. If things get tough, just get up and leave. We won't mind. I dream of wide open spaces, too. Going on walks with you. Just us guys, with our bags on our backs. Beautiful landscapes. I want to go on a trip with you. Just the two of us. I want you to have fond memories of me. Can I promise you something? Just believe. I'm sorry. For what? Your barbecue. Thank you. Do you want to be all wet too? I just spoke to Laurent. He is on his way. You see! You just need to push him a little. -When will he be here? -A good hour, he said. Good job I didn't wait for him! I will go and get some glasses. Did you tell my mom Laurent is on his way? Never mind, I will do it. -Laurent will be here in an hour. -Ah, finally! -Are you OK? -Yeah, you? Isn't Nathan with you? He is exploring the house. For God's sake, Alain! Are you mad? With Nathan too? And without consulting me? -If anything had happened... -I was right nearby. What if he had run off? I saw you speaking to him earlier. Filling his head with ideas! What are you trying to prove? That he can do whatever he wants? -Of course not. -What did you say to him? Nothing. Sneaking behind my back. I thought we were a team. If you carry on like this, you will ruin this night for everyone. Don't come crying to me afterward! Did you do all this? That must have been a lot of work. It is beautiful. It is really hot in there. I will leave you to it. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Jesus, I suck at this! Yeah, so I think I'm going to buy the camera instead. It is more expensive than a video camera, but the quality is great. Plus, it is a camera, so we will still have good quality photos. It will be fun when the baby is born. Wow, not bad. It will be cool for our kid to see themselves in 20 years. For Caroline and me, too, when we are older, I mean. Looking back on the memories, what we used to look like. There aren't any videos of me from when I was little. I would have liked that. To see what I was like, how I walked and talked. Your turn. Nathan? Mommy! Nathan? Mommy! -Mommy! -Nathan? Mommy! Nathan! Mommy! -Mommy! -What were you doing in there? Mommy! What is it, Nathan? Tell me. What is wrong, buddy? Tell me. Mommy... It is alright. You are OK now. Calm down. I'm here. You are OK. I hope you are not too hungry, it is not quite done yet. I am kind of hungry. Couldn't we eat something while we wait? Aren't you hungry? A bit, yes. I will think of something. Take that in. We could do with a hand, you know. Dinnertime! -Bring a jug of water, please. -Sure. Thanks. What is wrong? Are you OK? Nathan, don't stare at people like that. It is fine. Who wants some wine? Caroline sure doesn't! No, definitely not. Cyrielle? You all seem to be having a good time. Dinner is a bit chaotic tonight. I have just put the meat in to cook, so help yourself to salad, but save room for later. What is this? Did you do this, Nathan? Were you worried I would starve? Gaëtan, pass the bread, please. How is work going? Good. Last year was a bit quiet, but this year we are off to a good start. Well, not exactly. When I asked you the same question earlier, you laughed. Well, yeah, I was surprised. -About what? -I don't know. -That you asked me. -Why? I don't know. Don't worry, it was nice of you to ask. Will you give me some? -Can I ask you something? -We were having a conversation. -Are you glad I am here? -Of course, we are. Honestly! That is why we came here. Here, give me your glass. Do you feel better now? Where is it, Nathan? Don't start, this is not the time. But do you prefer Laurent, Caroline, or me? What is all this? We love you all the same. You are our children. I am starting to lose my patience. Did he have a glass, Caroline? -Yeah, we all love each other, but... -But what? Where is it then? Go and get him a glass, please. You are soaking wet, Cédric. Why don't you go and change? You will catch a cold. I went running on the treadmill to get in shape for my trip. Ah, right, OK. Enjoy, everyone! She is right, Cédric, it doesn't smell very nice. Here you go. Mommy has three children and two apples. Cédric, don't you dare. How is she able to give all of them -Cédric.. -the same amount -That is enough! -without leaving one out? Jesus, not again. I made it up. It is a riddle. Great. We don't care. Why? Can we change the subject, please? It is fine. It is only a riddle. About apples. Mom and Dad already know the answer. It is really easy. Gaëtan? Do you know the answer? Gaëtan? Caroline? Cyrielle? Nathan? Puree. She makes apple puree. Why are you laughing? Huh? -Why are you laughing? -Hey, let go of him! Mom! Cédric, stop that. What is wrong with you! I just want him to tell me why he laughed. Because he thought it was funny. He was being nice! I'm asking him. I laughed because I was surprised. And I thought it was funny the way you said "puree". It wasn't funny. You always laugh at unfunny things. Just to be nice, like Gaëtan. Right, that is enough. You will not ruin this evening. Come with me, right now. / You were asking for it. What? All I did was laugh at his goddamn joke. -It was a nervous laugh. -What the hell does that mean? Don't you realize you are provoking him? You are paying him too much attention. Don't. He is your brother. I am just trying to be nice. But you can't be friends with everyone! Tell us why you don't want to. Are you acting out? Plus, Dad is really sick. What are you talking about, Cédric? What is it then? Do you think we treat you differently? Don't speak to me like that. What do you expect, after what you just did to Gaëtan? I just wanted people to listen. Sorry, Gaëtan. Then I would be very careful what you say next. I don't want to listen to him. This is my night, dammit! I don't want him ruining it by saying whatever comes into his head. You do that too! You talk all the time! -It is not the same thing. -Why not? Forgive us for being a bit defensive, Cédric. Do you want to stay here with us? Austria. What comes to mind when I say that? Pristine, preserved nature, lakes of pure water, large mountains, and famous ski resorts. But Austria is also about its thriving customs and traditions, still thriving in the middle of a mutating Europe. The country that has birthed Mozart, Gustave Klimt, Sigmund Freud, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Hitler also has a modern touch. In the streets, on the terraces of famous cafes, we see young people busy building a new world. Austria: a country that doesn't reject its past but also turns its face to the future. Is that it, Cédric? Is that what you wanted to say? Look, we can talk about this tomorrow calmly. OK? Why? I'm ready. Cédric... But I know everything. That is Bregenz, the capital of Vorarlberg, one of the nine provinces. That is where our journey begins. On the lake of Constance, there is a glorious music festival. The tunnel of Arlberg, 14 km long. We have to buy a tax disk if we want to drive through it. 10.8 euros for ten days, 26 euros for two months, 86.5 euros for a year. But they have free passes in the hotels to visit museums or to go hiking with a guide. And they have very large breakfasts. We could make sandwiches from the leftovers. We understand. We understand perfectly, Cédric. You have learned it all by heart. We said we would let him talk. The beautiful region of Bregenzerwald, between the wooded hills of the Alpine foothills and the mountains. It has 20 or so little villages with houses covered in flowers. This one is interesting. Dornbirn: a very trendy town, apparently. Lünersee: you can get there by cable car between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. There is one every 30 minutes. Montafon, the southernmost valley of Vorarlberg. It stretches all the way to the Silvretta road which zigzags 2,032 meters up the Bielerhöhe, a truly mountainous amphitheater. Full of abundant, wild nature. Kleinwalsertal, we can only get there on foot from Austria. Tirol, a very charming region. That is where we will find my open space. A tip: in winter, everything is three times more expensive. So, we shall probably go in summer. I don't like skiing anyway. -You have never been skiing. -I know. We will take the road from the A14 which is easily accessible and which would only be a 20 minute detour. We can also take the Kaunertaler Gletscherstrasse which snakes through magnificent landscapes with majestic glaciers and moraines at the drop. On sunny days, in the late afternoon, the rock turns a beautiful pink and golden brown. Everywhere you look: flowers adorn the balconies, pure, clear water, glorious oratories and calvaries. Pansies, gentians, rhododendrons, azaleas that border the rim of the lake. The orchids too. The landscape is magnificent. And that is where we will enter into the country of Salzburg: on the Grossglockner road. A road that is so magical and admired-- That is enough! You realize if I do decide to let you go, we are talking about a week's vacation, two weeks tops. You can't honestly think you would be there a month? What about my open space? What open space? How do you expect to find that? You only have a picture. We don't even know where it is. Yes, I do. It is in that region. I recognize all of it: the nature, the surroundings. Or we could ask someone. Or call the tourist office at Innsbruck. 0043-5128282. The guides over there must know. I could call them now. Cédric, stay here. Each lake is a different color. The emerald Fuschlsee, the pale-green Mondsee, the clear blue Wolfgangsee. Superb chalets with quaint little bedrooms. Covered facades and pear trees. A country of medieval charm and joie de vivre which bursts into life in the rays of the sun during national holidays. Is that it? Are you done? You realize that there is something wrong here. Cédric? Being ready for this type of trip, in your case, it doesn't mean knowing all the restaurants or the country's GDP by heart. You need something else. Innsbruck, Salzburg, Hallstatt, the gem of Salzkammergut, Vienne, and Graz. I'm ready. Why won't Mom let me? She is worried about you. Aren't you worried? -For fuck's sake. -Caroline... What? Calm down. Calm down, everyone. OK. -Could you try and talk to her? -I'm sitting right here, Cédric. I can hear you. If Laurent was here, there is no way you would behave like this. You could come, too, if you like. You know I'm ready. You understand me. Apple puree. I don't know. Not really. Cédric, we are not trying to punish you. We just want to make the right decision. -We want to protect you. -Protect me from what? From a lot of things, and from yourself. Your illusions. The truth isn't always how you imagine it to be. You will be bitterly disappointed. We will see. All this is requiring a lot of effort from everyone here at the moment, you know. Sorry. -What do you mean? -I am going. I am going on my trip. Dad, are you coming? I don't owe you lot anything! I can go if I want to. So, who is coming with me? Dad? Cyrielle? You can come, Caroline. I don't mind. I would like that. Look at you. No one wants to go on a trip with you. That is enough now. That is fine. I will go on my own. Then, go. The door is open. -I'm going to Austria. -If you like, we don't care. But in that case, you leave right now. Do you know why you like Austria so much, Cédric? Why you desperately want to go there? I'm the one who told you your poster is from Austria. It might be Switzerland, France, Canada, who knows. I just said it was Austria. So you would leave me in peace. So you would stop hassling me. It is Austria! Maybe. Who knows. You can find out. Go on, get out. And take your map, it is covering the food. Cédric? Say you are sorry. No. If you are going, go now. Stop dawdling. Let me handle this. Hello. Are you OK? Do you need any help? Good evening. Good evening. Cédric, come inside. Come on, take all this off. Hurry up. Why does it have to come to this? Is this what you wanted? No. You were asking for it. After the scene you made. Where are your pajamas? Dad told me to put them in the basket. In here? These pajamas are fine. Come on, put them on. No. They are dirty. I told you they are fine. Look. But they were in with the dirty laundry. Don't you want to wear it? I am about to lose my temper, I am warning you. Right... We should have gone to a restaurant. It upsets him to see us. No. He cares about you. Maybe, but now... I feel like no one cares I'm going to be a mom. Wow. Great. I have never seen him like that. There. He has gone to bed. Now we can relax a bit. Could I have some more, please? Why did you tell him it was Austria? Oh, don't you start! You shouldn't have said anything if you didn't know. You are always judging people without knowing the full story. I'm putting myself in his shoes. Why can't he go on this trip? It is his dream. It is all he has. Look, talk to your father about it and then go on a nice family holiday. I don't want to hear any more about it! Actually, hearing him speak about it, sort of got me interested too. Hey! Why don't we go on vacation with your brother for our trip instead? And we know we can make sandwiches in the hotel. You idiot! Oh, lighten up! Are you tired, little man? You could put him to bed in the small bedroom... It is late. Let's put you to bed now. Where are you off to, buddy? I have only just arrived. Oh, I missed you! Did you and Mommy have a good day? Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm so late. I thought the meeting would never end! How are you, Dad? That is a lovely dress, Mom. How did you do it? -Do what? -Come back down. I came in through the door, like everyone else does. So, you are the one who organized all this. I hope it is worth it. Mom said you had a surprise for us. Have you got something to do with this? How are you? Has Mommy been nice to you? You can tell me later. Stop. What are you doing? Do you hear how Cyrielle speaks to your son? Mom, do something. Yes, do something. I don't know what to do anymore. How was the kid? Did he behave himself? Everyone pleased with him? Yes. Good. Come here. Come on. Cédric... -Come on. -Stop. -Stop it. -Come here. -What is wrong with you! -I'm sorry. Cyrielle... It is OK. I was just pretending. I was pretending to be your daddy. Did you like it at first, when I gave you a hug? It was great. It could have been. But no one wanted me to. You all love me so much that you want to keep me here. Laurent would never do that sort of thing. I know, I'm not Laurent. I don't want to be Laurent. It is not our fault if you are like this. Caroline... What do you mean "like this"? Calm down. I am calm. Your sister is sensitive. Don't take it out on her. Go ahead. That you are different. You are a pain. -Different from what? -From everyone. But you are different too. Gaëtan, too, and Mom, Dad, Cyrielle. Everyone is different to everyone. That isn't the point. And you are annoying too. But you aren't normal! Since when? What do you mean, since when? You have always been inept. -What does that mean? -Don't act all innocent. You had your tantrums, you were frightened of everything. Let's not bring it up again. That is just how life is. -That is just life. -Absolutely. I like you, Gaëtan. Do you know why I don't have a job or any friends? Or a phone? Or godparents? Huh? Of course, we know. Who would want to be your friend? Who would want to give you a job? And seriously, what would you do with a phone? You shut up! You are gonna be a mom! Well, you are here having dinner with us. Watching you silently talk about all your surprises. Is that good? -Unfortunately, it is the best we-- -The best? The best? The best would be me having things to talk about too. For people to ask me questions and include me. That people are glad to see me or wait for me when I am late. Or that I had someone sitting next to me whose hand I could hold under the table sometimes. How the fuck would that happen? I'm clean, and I can walk and talk normally. -Don't get angry, this is silly. -Stop. Stop telling me I have to calm down. I can't stand it! -Cyrielle, go and put Nathan to bed. -No, Nathan, don't go. Stay here. I won't get angry anymore. Mom, tell him he can go on his trip, please. Tell him. No. I don't want to. Not tonight. I'm sorry. You can go. No, I'm not giving in like that. -Mom! -I can't. I can't. It would be a lie. What isn't normal is me being here with all of you. What you put me through. How no one in this family understands me. If we had met somewhere else, we might have got along real good. Because I like you. I don't know. We will never know. Maybe. So, there is a problem here. You agree with me. Are you scared of me? Who are you scared of? Me? Or the bears? The bears can't help you. I know the bears. They want an answer too. Even if I'm not here, you are not comfortable here. -No, we don't want to know. -You don't want to know anything. Because you're scared too. -That is not true. -Yes, it is. Take my hand. Touch my arm. You never sit next to me. Cyrielle... When the bears come to your house, without me, are you scared? I feel uncomfortable sometimes. -But that is normal. -Yeah. That is normal. We have always tried our very best to make you feel welcome. Laurent would be very disappointed to hear that. He knows. We talk about it. I'm sorry. I don't always feel like I belong. Perhaps it is just me. Cyrielle, you are getting things all mixed up. Cédric is lucky to have the devoted family he has. Things could have been much worse. -What are you doing? -Cédric, give him his drink back. It is difficult for you. You look funny. Even though I haven't stopped you from having a drink that long. Three times, but you didn't get it. And now you know it was my fault. So, you feel better, but you are angry too. -Angry at me? -Yes. -Why did you do that? -Wait. If I committed myself to doing that to you every mealtime for years, would you go crazy? Stop that! Alain! Yes, you would go crazy. -In the end. -No, I'm not crazy. Not yet, but you would be. I'm not crazy! Yes, you are. You don't have a choice. I'm not crazy! See? You are starting to go a bit crazy already. I'm not crazy! Stop it! That is horrible! I'm not crazy! -Mom! -I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! Nathan, stop. You are not crazy. -See? -I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy, I'm not... Cyrielle, take him upstairs. I'm coming with you. Prost, Nathan. He is going to have a nice sleep now. Finally, we can be alone. As a family. All that rage... I'm not surprised. I stopped him having a drink all evening. What did we ever do to you, Cédric? Do you remember that sometimes you didn't set a place here for me? You were being punished. And all those days out without me for a bit of peace and quiet? You didn't want to go out. You were too frightened. A child who didn't want to go out? It is true. And all those nights I lay screaming in my bed? Do you remember? -Where were you? -I was here. You left me to scream. You let me scream. You left me because I was crying out. Because I needed help. You were scaring me. You were screaming like a madman. Because it hurt. It hurt everywhere. I was too little. We were both too little. But you are gonna be a mom now, so think about it like a mom would. It is not my fault! I never did anything! No, you didn't. You didn't do anything! If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't be here putting up with you and trying to understand you. You are not trying to understand! Trying to understand that something terrible is brewing here. In the house of the bears. You would rather go back to your home with your fetus and your garden. But listen closely. Something terrible is brewing here in the house of the bears. But you will go home, and that is normal. It was what you were taught to do. You are faithful. And you have often been rewarded for being a good girl. But here, we will go even further. I bought you the guide because I want you to go on your trip! That is kind of you, but we already have that guide. Same book, same number of pages. Identical. I don't know what is going on here, and I don't want to know. Ask Dad. Cédric... We have exhausted him. But you haven't done anything wrong yet. It is easier for you. You can still be forgiven. I don't know what the hell you are talking about! I am always crying out for help, Caroline. I can't put my life on hold for that! Yes, I might have had it easier than you. But I'm not going to beat myself up. Did you want me to tell everyone at the restaurant, without you? We should have because I am such a horrible person, and you hate us. Why do you keep misunderstanding like that? Cédric... Couldn't you at least let me have this? You got all the attention you wanted. You are too blind to see it. I can't even tell my own family I'm pregnant without your drama! Stop talking like that all the time. If you carry on mentioning it, you will lose it, I know you will. You are bleeding. Butt out, Dad, he is doing it on purpose! I'm talking here, and you are not even listening to me! I can't do this anymore! Auf Wiedersehen, my little consolation. I have trouble, too, sometimes. Especially with Alain. He totally blanked me when we were playing pool earlier. I swear, sometimes I feel like a kid around him. So lonely... -Jesus, I'm starving. -Me too. Are you happy now? What do you want? I want an apology! I will leave you to handle this. Where are you going? Mom! Come back! Mom! You can't do this anymore! You can't walk away anymore! I want an apology! Now! This is too hard. I can't do it anymore. Yes, you can, Mom. You are so brave. He is pushing me over the edge. After all the sacrifices, it is so hard when he never shows me an ounce of gratitude. -We have tried everything. -I know, but you have Laurent and me, too, and we are so lucky to have parents like you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry we have to go through this. I love you, Mom. Never forget that. And I'm proud to be your daughter. Laurent! You scared me. I'm not finished! You ran away, but I'm warning you: I won't kill myself! I will stay here for a long time, and make you cry even more. I'm gonna explode if you don't come back. Mom! Mom! I'm the one who should be crying all the time, but I don't! I will keep doing this until you understand. I will force you to understand, and you will understand, and then, you will want to cry! I will show you things. Things that will hurt you. With even more anger if I have to. I am holding myself back for you! You think you are different, but you are just like me! We are all the same! Cédric... I'm sorry. Ah, there you are. About time. Everyone has been waiting for you. You need to calm down. Where were you anyway? Why weren't you answering? Poor Cyrielle... My Edelweiss. Don't start. Come on. Cédric. Don't make a fuss. Where did you come from? I'm not done. I'm gonna jump you! Tell me you love me, and I will go upstairs on my own. Calm down now. Calm down! Will you take him to his room? Laurent? What is going on? Nothing. I'm just putting him to bed. There you are. -Everything OK with Nathan? -Yes, he fell asleep straight away. -Are you OK? -I'm fine. -Do you need any help? -No, it is fine. Laurent will help. Go and help Caroline, we are setting the table. The straps. My beautiful Laurent... There. Are you coming down? In a while. I will stay with him a bit. Will you be OK? Are you going to tell me how you managed to get out earlier? It is a mystery... You won't get the apology you are after. Deep down, I know that I did everything I had to. Everything I could do. I will not be held accountable. Except for bringing you into this world. And I feel no guilt about that. The choices we made were forced upon us. That is all. And I will never feel guilty about any of it. But do you know what I feel on nights like this? Disgust. I am disgusted. Sad, isn't it? It is sad that it has come to this. Nathan, what are you doing here? Go back to bed. I'm not tired. Well, you certainly look it. Come on. Bedtime. Are you comfortable? That is it. Now, go to sleep. Goodnight. Goodnight, little angel. Sleep tight. I don't know what has happened to the affection I had for you. I don't think I have any left. It has run out. Just like the joy of being a mother that you stole from me, Cédric. It sounds like I'm blaming you, but I want to be honest with you from now on. So, I am going to finish raising you. Alone. To the end. That is my burden. I will, since I cannot leave you, and you cannot survive without me. So, we will both have to be very patient. I hope that with time, I won't have to worry anymore. Maybe then, you will realize how much, and much more than the others, you have been the center of our very devoted attention. And our boundless love. And that day, who knows, perhaps you will learn to smile again. Tomorrow, we will ask your father to remove these if you like. Right. I'm going back downstairs. Try and go to sleep quickly. I never sleep. Marguerite... -Everything OK? -Yes, he has calmed down at last. Can I give my mother a hug now? Yes, please. -Are you OK? -Better. You look nice, it suits you. So, this little thing is in your stomach right now? Come here, sis. Congratulations. You are going to have a beautiful baby. Thanks. -Congratulations. -Thanks. You realize this is just the beginning, man? Oh, yeah... She is gonna be a real nightmare. She is bad enough in general, but now she is gonna be even worse! Any advice? Oh, I know a couple of tricks. I will show you. How rude! Get your mind out of the gutter, Mom! -God, I want a drink! -See? I told you! -You will have to behave yourself. -She can have one drink with us. -Yeah! -OK, but that is the last one. -Agreed? -Agreed. You are on a slippery slope, my friend. Asshole! Those two are starting to catch up to us. We might have to have a couple more. Little by little. Yeah. Champagne! I am keeping my eye on you! Oh! Are you in charge now, then? Caroline... Exactly. So, get used to it! I will believe that when I see it! Gaëtan, will you do the honors? Thank you. -Looks like he is struggling a bit! -Haha, very funny! -Use this. -Come on! -Come on! -We might need a sword! Come on! Come on! There! Would you like some? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy... Mommy! Calm down. Cédric. Cédric... Do you know what they used to do with kids they couldn't teach? When they broke out in uncontrollable fits of rage? Their teacher took them to a field of weeds. Hundreds of acres of weeds. And they made them pull them all out. They were only allowed to stop when they had calmed down. Stop it. Of course, it just made them angry at first. They felt humiliated. But over time, something strange happened. The weeds they had been taking all their anger out on slowly became something they cared for. Cédric... Let me finish. This is important. The weeds became something they cherished. Something they cared about more than anything else. So much so, that in the end, it was just as hard to tear them away from this task as it was to make them do it in the first place. Do you understand? Do you understand what that means? Subtitling: Hiventy
