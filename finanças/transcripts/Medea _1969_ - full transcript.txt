Today you're 5 and I want to tell you the truth. You're not my son and I didn't find you in the sea. It was all lies. You're not a liar, but I am. I enjoy telling lies. Are you sorry to find out you're not my son, that I'm neither your father or mother? It all started because of a ram's hide. There was a talking ram, it was divine. Hermes gave the ram to Nefele so she could save her sons. Ino wanted to kill them. Ino was the wife of Cadmo and second wife of Atamante. Atamante was the son of Eolo, the wind god. Ino had also been Eolo's wife. Anyway, it was all a matter of jealousy. The ram had a golden fleece and managed to carry one of Nefele's sons across the sea. His name was Frisso. Frisso arrived in the city of Ea: ruled by Eta, the sun's daughter. Eta welcomed Frisso and to give thanks to Zeus, sacrificed the golden ram. Eolo's descendants wanted to get the fleece back, because it brought the king luck. It guaranteed an everlasting reign... and everything would remain the same. They tried everything to get it back, but they didn't succeed. They didn't succeed. Little boy, you are a descendant of Eolo because you are a grandson of Atamanta, who was king of Olco, a city nearby. It was rich with sheep and grain, all the property of the king. Your Uncle Pelia imprisoned your father and usurped the throne. The kingdom awaits you and I'll keep you safe here. Have you understood? It's a rather complicated story because it made up of facts, not thoughts. Everything's sacred, everything's sacred. Remember, my boy: there's nothing natural in nature. When it seems natural to you, it'll be the end. Something else will start. Good-bye sky, good-bye sea. What a beautiful sky! Close... Happy... Don't you think that just a little piece is natural and not possessed by a god? Just like the sea. On this day, when you're 13 and fish with your feet in the water. Look behind you, what do you see? Anything natural? What you see is an apparition. With clouds reflected in the still, heavy water at three in the afternoon. Look at that black streak on the sea, shining light, pink like oil. The shadows of the trees and the reeds. A god is hidden everywhere you look. If he isn't, he's left traces of his scared presence: the silence, the smell of grass, the chill of fresh water. Yes, everything's sacred. But sanctity is also a curse. Whilst the gods love, they also hate. Maybe you think that besides being a liar, I'm also too poetic. But for ancient man, myths and rituals are concrete experiences, which are even included in his daily existence. For him, reality is a totally perfect unit, and the emotion he feels at the sight of a summer sky, for example, equals the more internal, personal experiences of modern man. You'll go to your Uncle, who stole your throne, and reclaim your rights. To eliminate you, he'll have to come up with an excuse. He'll send you on a quest, maybe to retrieve the golden fleece. That way, you'll travel to a distant land across the sea. You'll experience things in a world we can only imagine. Life there is very realistic. Because only he who is mythical is realistic and vice versa. This is what our divine reason foresees. That which it can't foresee... sadly, are the errors it will lead you to. Who knows how many there'll be? That which man has witnessed in the cultivation of grains, that which he has learned from this relation, that which he has understood from the example of the reborn seeds, all this represents a definite lesson: the resurrection, my love. But now that lesson is no longer useful. That which he has gleaned from the rebirth of the seeds, holds no more meaning for you. Like a distant memory that no longer affects you. In fact, there are no gods. Give life to the seed and be reborn with the seed. Wait for me here. Dear uncle, I have come to reclaim my kingdom. I'll give it back, but you too will give something, for communal good. - What do you mean? - There's a symbol of the perennity of power and order. This symbol is the golden fleece of the sacred ram. It is to be found in a distant land, across the sea which no one has visited. If you bring the golden fleece back to our city, I'll give back the kingdom. - What fine horses! - Let's take them! Here, pray for us! Get me ready, I want to go to the temple. Come on, wake up! - Come with me. - Where? Come with me! Help me steal the fleece. What's happening? - What is it? - A woman's coming in a cart! With a golden ram's fleece! Don't be stupid! Get the horses ready. This place will cave in, it has no support! Don't pray to god because he blesses your tents! Don't repeat god's first act! You don't search for the centre! Don't mark the centre! No! Find a tree! A staff! A stone! Earth, talk to me! Let me hear your voice! I no longer recall your voice. Talk to me, Sun! Where is the place in which I can hear your voice? Talk to me, Earth! Talk to me, Sun! Perhaps you're disappearing! I no longer hear what you say! You, grass, talk to me! You, rock, talk to me! Earth, where are you? Where can I find you again? Where is the bond that joined you to the sun? My feet touch the ground and I don't recognize it. My eyes look at the sun and I don't recognize it. I think today you will experience something unexpected. You'll find out that kings are not always obliged to keep promises. Fine, I understand. Here it is. Keep the fleece, symbol of the perennity of power and order. My quest has shown me the world is bigger than your kingdom. And if you want, I'll tell you what I think the truth is: away from his land, this fleece has no meaning. Good. Time has come to separate. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye! Jason. Jason! Why are you here? - Why are you here? - You mean "why are we here?" - It's a vision! - If so, you are causing it. - We are inside you. - I only knew one centaur. You knew two. A sacred one, when you were a boy and a desecrated one when you became an adult. But the sacred part is kept alongside the desecrated form. Here we are, one beside the other. What's the purpose of the old centaur I knew as a child? The one that you, new centaur, replaced without banishing. Of course he doesn't speak... because his logic differs too much from ours for us to understand. But I will speak for him. It's under his sign that you, despite your calculations and interpretations, in reality love Medea. - I love Medea. - Yes. You pity her too and understand her spiritual catastrophe, her disorientation as an ancient woman, in a world that ignores all she ever believed in. The poor thing's had a conversion in reverse. - She hasn't recovered. - How does knowing this help me? It doesn't. It's reality. And you, why are you telling me all this? Because nothing can stop the old centaur from inspiring feelings and me, the new centaur, from expressing them. Wet nurse, come with me. - Hurry, wet nurse. Come with me. - Where? - To Corinth. - But you can't! Come with me. Madam, why have you decided to resign yourself like this? What should I do? - They say... - What they say? That in your homeland, if you wanted, you could work miracles. Dominate air, fire. At least that's what the Corinthians say. - They're frightened of you. - Frightened? Yes, like a magician. Sorry, but they say that in the hope of helping you, pushing you to... To work magic? I've been away from my homeland for more than 10 years. - But you're still what you were. - No. I'm another creature now, I've forgotten everything. - What was reality is so no longer. - Perhaps, if you wanted, you could recall your god. No... Perhaps you're right, I've remained as I was. A vessel full of knowledge that is not mine. Don't you recognize me? Yes. You're my father's father. And what are you waiting for? - Courage. Oh god! Oh justice dear to god! Oh sunlight! The victory I foresee over my enemies will be marvellous! Now I will go straight to the sign! I'll avenge myself as I must! Oh god! Oh justice dear to god! Oh sunlight! Listen to my plans. One of my women will tell Jason to come to me. I'll will be very sweet and tell him: "You must marry the king's daughter". I'll tell him: "This marriage will be very useful to our sons." Oh god! Oh justice dear to god! Oh sunlight! As you have revealed your plans, we want to be useful and advise you to remember the purest human laws. It's not anymore possible for me to act differently. You can't approve, because you've not suffered like me. Who'll give you the courage to do what you have in mind? Who'll give that courage to you? I'll find the courage in thinking about his destruction. But it won't help you, poor desperate woman. That's enough, wet nurse! Enough! It's time to act! This chatter is completely useless. Go and get Jason and bring him here. But please, don't tell him of our plans. You love me! And you're a woman! In your old robes, Medea, in your old robes. Children, come here! You wanted me to come. Here I am. What is the news? Take these robes... and give them to Glauce for her wedding. Tell her that I do not want to hurt her and wish her happiness. Now take your father's hand, he'll take you to her. Forget all past bitterness towards him, as I have done. We have made peace. Come on, children. Take him by the hand. I have a dark presentiment of pain. My dear children, you will live long lives and grip your father's hand. Poor me. I do nothing but cry and suffer dreadful anguish. Just as I have decided to finish my undignified disagreement with your father. Here I am, crying. Don't repent for what you've done, it's natural for you to be mad at me. But now it seems that wisdom prevails inside you. And you children, you can be certain that your father has been thinking of your future. Together with your brothers, you will occupy the first place in this city. Why are you still crying? Don't worry. Woman is a weak creature and cries easily. But promise me... promise me you'll beg the bride to convince the king, her father, not to banish our children. Don't worry, I'll do it. Go, quickly. Go now. If you're lucky, as I hope, you'll return with the happy news that we're expecting. Let's go. Mama sends you this gift for your wedding. She says she doesn't want to hurt you and wishes you happiness. You cannot accept this gift, listen to us. Thank your mother a lot, children, and tell her I am very pleased with the gift she gave me. Dress me. What a beautiful wedding dress. Come with me. Medea. I was looking for you. Don't look at me like that, full of anger towards your husband. I must order you to leave this city, together with your two sons. Immediately! I am personally interested in your exile and I won't go home until you are outside the borders of my kingdom. But why my sons too? Because you frighten me. I'm afraid, and I tell you openly, for my daughter. Everyone in this city knows coming from a strange land, you are an expert in evil. You are different from us, so we don't want you here. My knowledge of these things is very poor. And then, why should I be offended by your words? Only he is fully responsible, my husband. I am not hurt by your behaviour. In fact, I think it's just. I am not even hurt by your happiness. Go ahead with the wedding. Yes, be happy. I just ask a single favour. Don't banish me, leave me here. I will bow my head for him, who is stronger than me. Your words are surely sweet, human. But it is impossible to look into the depths of a soul. It is true. This is true. Give me at least a day to think about the exile, and to ask help for my children now that their father has completely abandoned them. Unfortunately, my will is not ruthless like that of a tyrant. My indolence has often been my downfall. I feel I'm making a mistake, but I want to grant your request. I want to tell you the truth. It is not for hatred, nor for suspicion of your diversity arrived in our city with signs of an other race, that I am afraid. It's for fear of what you could do to my daughter. She feels guilty about you. And knowing you are suffering, she suffers too and cannot rest. This marriage to Jason means everything to her... except happiness. Because you, without blame, can oppress her with your presence, I, brutally, want you to leave my land! Ma'am. Ma'am. Wet nurse, please go and call Jason. My right hand, gripped many times by your hands. My knees, embraced uselessly so many times, by this miserable man who owes me everything and over whom I have lost all hope. What are you crying? It's time you understood that I owe the results of my efforts to myself. You'll never admit it, but if you did something for me, you only did for the love of my body. You say that I'm ungrateful, but I, maybe without effort or even realization, gave you much more than I received in return. Don't boast about this. You summoned me. Here I am, I'll listen to you willingly, even though you hate me. So, what news is there? There is no news. I only wanted you to pardon me. I know very well that I am destined for a friendless exile and that all else is now useless. I was unjust and you were right to behave as you did. Pardon you? Yes, I pardon you. That's all that I ask of you before I leave. Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye! Children, come here! Take these robes and give to Glauce for her wedding. Tell her that mama doesn't want to hurt her and wishes her happiness. Take your father by the hand, he will take you to her. Forget all past bitterness towards him, as I have done. We have made peace. Come on, take him by the hand. I have a dark presentiment of pain. My children, you will live long lives and grip your father's hand. Poor me, I do nothing but cry and suffer dreadful anguish. Just as I have decided to finish my undignified disagreement with your father. Here I am, crying. It's natural for you to be mad at me. And you, children, can be certain that your father has been thinking of your future. Together with your new brothers, you will occupy the first place in this city. Why are you still crying? Don't worry. Woman is a weak creature and cries easily. But promise me... promise me you'll beg the bride to convince her father not to banish our children. Don't worry, I'll do it. Good-bye. Go, quickly. If you are fortunate, as I wish, you'll return with the happy news that we're expecting. Mama sends you this gift for your wedding. She says she doesn't want to hurt you and wishes you happiness. Thank your mother a lot, children, and tell her I am very pleased with the gift she gave me. Madam! Madam! Come, it's time to sleep. - Just a while longer! - Behave yourself, come on! Get down! Be good. Down. There, all done. What a good boy you are. Now let's go to sleep. Let's go. Climb into mama's arms. Come on, let's go. Get down. Come on. Darling. Sleep, be good. Sleep. Sleep. Darling. Why do you try to pass through the fire? You can't do it! It's useless to try! You can talk to me if you want, but I don't want you near me. What have you done? What have you done! Aren't you suffering like me now too? My god, I want to suffer! That same god will condemn you! Enough! - What do you want from me? - Let me bury my children. - Go and bury your bride. - I'll go! I'll go, but without my two children! The tears you shed now are nothing! You'll realize when you're old! Oh, dear god! Let me caress those poor, innocent bodies! No! Don't keep insisting! It's useless! Nothing is possible any more! Corrections and resynch: SmallBrother
