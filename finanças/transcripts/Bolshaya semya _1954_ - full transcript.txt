Big Family What's going on, people? What's the matter? Another Zhurbin went down the slipway, officer! - How did they name him? - Matvey. Matvey? In honor of his granddad? Great-granddad! Ah, right. Hi-ya, Kuzmich. International salute, 21 times. And the last one! What? What salute? Another working man was born, gravedigger for capitalism. He's a grandfather now! Kostya and Dunyasha brought me a grandson! Congratulations, Comrade Zhurbin, congratulations. The whole shipyard will be reconstructed, the whole process will go in a new way. Is it trustworthy? Of course, Anton sent a letter. Here. They've passed his project. We'll switch to line production. And where is your Anton now? He is a Ph.D. in a scientific research institute. He'll come here soon to take matters into his hands. What are you so happy about? What's good about changes? That it's the idea of his son? Think about us, old men. What will we do? He is right. What are you afraid of? It will work. Maybe some wimps will quit, and that's all. We'll be first to drop out. Sanya, whatever changes on the shipyard, they won't make it without us, old workers. But the ageů You proud man! We are old and we work as of old. But you said they would change everything. Old, old, you're a croaker. The age is not the point. Alesha, your youngest son, is a riveter, but there won't be rivets any more. A boy? A boy! Your father, Matvey Dorofeevich, drudged away 50 years on the shipyard. What will he do now? Become a watchman? Basmanov, don't worry about me. Think about yourself. Right you are, father. We are a working class. You know, working class is a base, base of the human life. In the whole world. What a theorist you are, dad. What's wrong? Not &quot;base&quot;, but &quot;basis&quot;! You're too young to teach your father! Let it be &quot;basis&quot;, let's speak like educated men. No way. It's better to live as an unmarried loner, than to marry some first comer. Ah, that's not it. You've smartened yourself up, and don't even know that there's no more work for riveters. What? I've heard it with my own ears. You believe in any rubbish that is said. Here. What's that for? What for? You've passed to the 10th grade! 60 roubles! Alesha! Thank you, Alesha! Alesha is getting married, right? Yes, seems so. Then you'll have to ask for a room in the new block. With gas oven and garbage disposer. But he doesn't want it. It's not good to pull up the roots. They'll pack us into their tiny flats and break our family. And you think about disposers. Alesha should write an application to the shipyard committee, he's a stakhanovite, they'll give him a room! Pour you some vodka? Just pass me some bread. Then, let him write it. And granddad will support him, he's a shipyard committee member, after all. You're not a waste of space either. You know, auntie Lida, when I was a kid people told me I'll be pretty when I grow up. But they were wrong. You, auntie Lida, are very pretty. I wish you happiness. Beauty doesn't bring happiness. You are young. And what do I have? Nothing. Imagine it, I'm almost 30 and still sitting here, waiting for something, I don't even know what for. Hear that? Ships, Ships, they're talking about ships all the time. Love is long forgotten. Maybe it doesn't exist at all? Real loveů How is it possible, auntie Lida? What about Kostya and Dunyasha? What about mom and dad? You and Viktor? Viktor? Do I even see him? He can wake up in the middle of the night, turn on the lights and start to draw. When I look in the morning at his work, it's just some wheels with teeth. He's just a woodworker, why would he need all these wheels? I never see him. Tonya, you're not a child. Please, tell me what to do. There is a man who runs after me. It can end up horribly. Granddad! Wear it, my granddaughter. Here. Be happy. Thank you! Is it grandmum's? Did you love her much? Did you love her for real? For real? I took her away from the estate manager whom she didn't love. She ran towards me in her wedding dress, I got her into the open sledge and we dashed almost 15 miles though the frost was severe. What happened next, granddad? Since that very cold night, since our wedding and till her death we haven't had any quarrels or even disputes. And you're questioning if I loved her for real. You know, Alesha, once there was a man whose name was Herostratus. He burnt down the Temple of Artemis in Efes to become famous. There were also kings who were horrible butchers, like Richard III, and people remembered them. But they were real monsters. Yeah, you know history well. I have decided to become a historian a long time ago. Do you like history, Alesha? Ah, no, I've already forgotten what I've been taught. I left school after 7th grade. Really? It was wartime. Dad said he needed help at the shipyard, so I became a worker, gravedigger for capitalism, like he often says. And I'm just a draftswoman. Ah, what have I done! Katya, Katya, listenů Sorry, Alesha, it's too late, I have to go. I'll walk you home. No, I don't want my mom to see you. What, what's going on? Anton! Alesha! Damn, you scared me. When did you arrive? On the night Moscow train. Get onto the bed, I'll go sleep on the floor. No way, I'll sleep on the floor, look, mother made the bed. Listen, Anton, you're an uncle now! For real? Dunyasha gave birth to a son. I know already. You're an uncle and I'm an uncle and all of us... Let's go to sleep, uncle. Anton! You'll do serious changes here, right? So? There will be a lot of work for draftsmen. They'll have to stay overtime, in the eveningsů Yeah, there will be a lot of work for everyone. But why do you care about draftsmen so much? No, I justů Ah, you justůYou'd better think about yourself. You'll have to change your job. What do you mean? I don't know how to explain. How we constructed ships before? Move a bit. Like a house. Brick by brick, sheet by sheet. And now we'll make sections in shop floors. Huge pieces of ships. Here is one section, and here is another. We'll join them together, weld them on the slipway and the ship is ready. So, one ship is being joined together and parts of the next one are already being constructed and are waiting for getting together. Got it? I did, but what does all this have to do with my job? This sequence-flow method doesn't need your rivets at all! Everything is done by welding. Go, granddad is signaling. Look at this boaster, &quot;comrades, we're comrades&quot;. Are all these weld beads even durable? What if they just fall apart? It depends on how well we weld them! You say &quot;we&quot;? Of course, who else? No one else but us. No, not &quot;we&quot;, Ilyusha, you do it alone, on your own. I don't approve of risks. When I can't do anything I just say it straightforwardly: &quot;I cannot&quot;. And youůEither you became arrogant because it's your Anton's idea, or you lack honesty. Comrade Basmanov! Comrade Zhurbin! What is your dispute about? Have you decided upon the schedule? We have no time for schedules, we're busy with scientific discussions, what's better: the old way or the new way. So, uncle Sanya, you're also against me? You don't trust new technologies? You got it wrong, Anton Ilyich. I don't trust myself. I'm too old, Comrade Ph.D., to rebuild myself anew. But you're communist, uncle Sanya. Communists grow older, too. And old men are routineers, stiff people. Are you a routineer? Yes, I am. That's not true, uncle Sanya! Uncle Sanyaů Alexander Alexandrovich, we have a problem at the stern room. All right, I'm coming. I have to go as long as someone needs me. Hm, I haven't taken this into account. What are you doing? What are you doing? Take off the contact device. Take it. Thank you. Let me help you. No, thank you, I'll do it myself. Thank you. Excuse me, but I haven't seen you at the shipyard before. I've just arrived, administration sent me here. I see. I graduated from the university and I'm going to work here on the slipway. On the slipway? - Yes Nice to meet you. I'm Skobelev, engineer and head clerk of the engineering data bureau. I'm Zinaida Pavlovna Ivanova. Can you tell me how to get to the first slipway section? Here it is! I'll walk you there with great pleasure. Thoughůit's not a long way, you can get there by yourself. Thank you. You're welcome. Heh, on the slipway! I have already been everywhere andů So what are you going to create here at our shipyard? I think I'll work on the slipway here. Sorry? I'm a scaffolder technologist. Administration sent me here. Bah, a scaffolder technologist! So, let's go! I'll show you around. You're welcome. Please, you're welcome. Sorry. Aleshka! Our best riveter, Alexey Zhurbin, my son! Here we are. Now everything is clear for you. It's quite clear in detail, but I cannot get the whole idea yet. I mean, the building of a ship in a whole. In a whole? Who is it? I'll tell you later. Zinaida Pavlovna, when I was appointed as a foreman... When was that? In 1936, I think. Not so long ago, about 16 years passed. I didn't get the whole idea at first. It comes with passing years. Experience. Was that an encouragement? 16 years is a long period! Did you, Zinaida Pavlovna, think that if you graduated from university you can already become a skilled worker? You'll have to learn a lot from old workers. Practice a lot. A person must get ready, Zinaida Pavlovna. What are you, the foremen, doing? Drillers are doing their work crouched between the bottom parts. Meet Anton, my son, he is also an engineer. Ivanova. - Zhurbin. Zhurbin, right. They're drilling by sight, it's inappropriate. Stop shouting, Antosha. It's Sanya's and my invention. We press new sheets to the old ones and drill using same holes. You can't get more accuracy. Even Noah's Ark was built more accurately! Look, he's trying to teach me what to do. Thank you, Ilya Matveevich, I'd better go not to bother you. Good bye. Good bye, all the best. Good bye. You had to make all the calculations 100 times quickerů Don't tell me what to do! Wait a moment, Zinaida Pavlovna! Just a moment, and I'll give you a lift. So, have you taken a look at slipways? Noise, rumbling, so romantic! Fresh sea breeze and you, building ships over there. Such a beautiful image, you know. I had same thoughts after graduating from university. Do you know how it can turn out in reality? How? You'll sit in some bureau, just like me, and do some boring paperwork, that's how. But I graduated from universityů I know it well, you graduated with excellent marks, you have romantic dreams etc. You know, I can't stand your philosophy of doom and helplessness. Believe me, you'll get the place at Technical Information Bureau. A harbor that is too serene for such a hot head like you. Stop the car. You know what, keep your teachings to yourself. Comrade Zhurbin is going to get married. But there is no free space in their house anymore. Thus, Alexei Zhurbin is applying for a room in a new block. What do the members of the shipyard committee think? I have some questions. You're welcome. Firstly, I want him to tell what he will do when rivets will be replaced with welding. Depending on his answer we'll decide whether to give him a room or not. Uncle Vanya, I don't work for rooms. Bah, listen to him! Wait, wait, then what do you work for? If you don't need the room, maybe you don't need any payment, too? Bah, look at this free-wheeling man. Your father, grandfather and I made the revolution so that you could get the room! What? That's true! We slept on the ground with guns in our hands and you say you don't need anything. Like a nobleman. I'm not a nobleman, I'm a worker. I don't work just for myself. And I'm not going to boast about it some 30 years later. That's how you talk to us? A noblemanů Deny his application. Deny. Do whatever you want, I don't care. Deny. Typical Zhurbin, grandson and granddad have just the same temper. What? Let me say, Gorbunov. You're welcome. Comrades, can't we understand the man? He is going to get married. I've almost failed with my graduation project due to same thing. Deny! Wait, old man. He works well, he is the best riveter, so I suggest we should give him a room. To give him a room? Shut up, Nyurka! I need a book about the Golden Horde by professor Grekov. Butů We don't have this book at the moment. All the copies are on hands. Made in Hungary? No. But I've been waiting for the whole month. I need the book for my work. But I've already told you: we don't have this book. What's the problem? Why cannot you attend to the woman? But she needs a book by professor Grekovů About the Golden Hordeů And I've already told her all the copies are on hands. That's all. We'll settle it right now. Let's go to my office, I'll give you my own copy. Comrade governorů Don't you see I'm busy? Please, take a sit. The book you're asking for is given to me by the author. You know professor Grekov in person? Are you a historian? No, I belong to the dying out class. I'm romanticist. You've just asked me if I knew Boris Dmitrievich Grekov, right? May I? As you please! I knew a lot of interesting outstanding people. LeoůI mean, Alexey Tolstoy was a friend of mine. I used to visit Konstantin Stanislavsky quite often. As he used to say: &quot; Listen, my dear, I don't believe it&quot;. He was a funny old man. I used to shoot pool with Vladimir Vladimirovich for hoursů With whom? With Mayakovskiy, Vladimir Vladimirovich. And now I'm a club governor here, as you see. Oh, such a pity! Someone has taken that book! That's bad. But we can fix it. Why don't you, Ekaterinaů Ivanovna. Call me just Katya. Why don't you visit my place? You could take a look at my private collection of books. I live not far from here. No, I don't want to disturb you. Ah, stop it. You know, friendship usually develops gradually, step by step, but evolution is not the only way of development. Dialectics admit saltatory evolution. If I happen to meet your gaze, Your eyes so azure, so blue The soul in my breast, in a daze, Asks to come out to you. Whose poem is that? Lermontov's, butů Right you are, it's Mikhail Lermontov. So, let's go? Oh, how can IůYou'd better visit our place someday. Hello. Mother will be glad to meet you. Thank you, with great pleasure. What? Are you crazy? How could you think about me like that! How dirty! Get down. Enough, get down. Alesha, I need some more timeů Get down, I told you. Alesha, I'll stay here a bit longer. It's nothing to do here, go home. We must fix the wiresů We can do it later. But Alesha, I want to. I don't care of what you want. Go help mom. I'll stay anyway. Let's go, Tonya. You're such a thickhead. Haven't you noticed he is glancing at his watch every time? So you're waiting for that Katya? Tonya! Groom! Groom! Go. As though I were sailing with the great blue sky above me and big white birds flying over it. Why is it? Why? My darling white birdů Here's your home. Dear Katya, we won't study history by reading books, but by old greyish stones. Have you ever been to Middle Asia? Oh, we will go to the archeological excavations of ancient Chorasmia. You will hold Scythian arrows and quivers in your own hands. Yes, Scythian. So, see you tomorrow at the set time. Yeah. Alesha! What are you doing here? Why didn't you come? Come where? What do you mean? To have a look at the apartment. Oh, I've totally forgotten about it. It just slipped from my mind. And I've been waiting for you since 7 o'clock, as we arranged. Maybe you could come tomorrow? Sure! No, I cannot come tomorrow. Why? You know, Alesha, my school friend is sick. I need to visit her. Let's go together. No, we cannot, you can get infected. I'd better come when I have some time. All right, I will wait till you are free. Alesha+Katya = love What are you doing, dear? We are waiting for these sheets and you're chilling out here. What are people thinking about? Don't get mad, uncle Sanya. There was a mistake here and now I'm trying to fix it. A mistake? Mistakes don't appear by themselves, someone makes them. If you made a mistake, it's a throw-away, do you know such a word? But I didn't do it on purpose. It's just a mistake, I told you! A mistake? Don't you think I can tell Ilya about your mistakes? Maybe his son's wife gives birth to outstanding children, but at work she is just a waste-producer. Stop shouting. It's my mistake and she's trying to fix it now. See, you thickhead? How can it be your mistake? What are you talking about, Matvey Dorofeevich! You're the best layout specialist of the shipyard. I used to be the best, but not any more. My eyes are getting worse. I cannot keep up with the others. Hey, stop talking down on yourself. A mistake can be corrected. You can correct a mistake, but you cannot make me younger. Rakhmaninov, &quot;Serenade&quot; Why aren't you watching the concert, madame? I have concerts every single day, at home. Can you look after my car, so that boys don't scribble something on it? Comrade Zhurbin! Zhurbin! Hello. What about a day off of an oustanding stakhanovite? Why me? I got a call from editorial office; they urgently need such a feature. We have many stakhanovites at the shipyard. But the shipyard committee gave me your name, Alexey Mikhailovichů Ilyich. I'm sorry, Ilyich. 12 pictures of you will be published in the All-Soviet Union magazine. All-Soviet Union! Let's begin with the picture of breakfast. You'll lay the tableůdo you have a dinner set? We'll find it somewhere. All right. Come on Sunday morning, so that she gets to knowů She? And he will receive a punch in his face. I'm sorry, what did you just say? That was not for you. Let me introduce myself, Viktor Zhurbin. Zhurbin? How many of you are there at the shipyard? I work here not for a long time, but got to know three of you already. And you'll get to know many more. Sit down, please. People say they can build a ship by themselves, just their family. There are workers, welders, riveters among them. One of them is even an educated engineer. I am a modelist-woodworker. He writes songs, they also have a family choir. It's so interesting! What songs? It's rubbish. I came to you on business. Yes, I'm listening to you. What I want to discuss isů Auntie Liza! Auntie Liza! If someone from the club comes, tell them I fixed everything. No one asked for me, right? My brother, Anton, arrived. He has big plans. I know, an all-welded ship. Lots of new models will be needed. Here's a nice how-do-you-do! Generally speaking, I want to create a working machine so that all the woodworks could be processed with its help. We're still doing everything manually. That's a very interesting idea! The idea is not a problem, what's important is to come up with the design that would work. I need an overlook on the achievements in this sphere. Do you have anything like that? Well, I'll choose the literature you may need as soon as possible. Is it ok? Yes. Told you, Zinaida Pavlovna. I was right, I am a prophet. You're stuck in the bureau, too. Hi-ya, Alesha! Hi-ya, dad. Hello, Alesha. Soů Look how the son welcomes his dad. Take a sit, let's have a breakfast. Yeah, nice idea. It's closer to dinner time, though. Alesha! Put it down. We need to have a talk. Won't we disturb you? What are you talking about, dad. Hey, Sanya, give me a can opener. You were right, Sanya, I admit. Young people have time for everything. They told me at the shipyard committee yesterday, he decided to please me. He decided to take photos of a standard day of an outstanding stakhanovite. All-Soviet Union fame. Alexey Zhurbing having breakfast. Look, he even brought plates from mother. They preserved from pre-revolution times. Alexey Zhurbin doing exercises on the chinning bar at the shipyard stadium. Naked, just in his underpants. All-Soviet Union. Such things won't even cross your mind, I suppose. Dad. What? Take it away. 12 pictures of Alexey Zhurbin, see, Sanya? And how did Alesha Zhurbin become famous? Who gave him the idea of changing the hammer construction? Who was it? Korneev, an engineer. But Alesha forgot about it. But I keep it in mind. And who helped him to rearrange the work in a brigade? Foreman Basmanov, here he is. But Alesha forgot about it. And I keep it in mind! Hey, hey, Sanya, eat, please. Eat everything. A showpiece breakfast. He is right, Alesha. Fame doesn't appear from nothing. It is developed together, not individually. You've come to tell off? Right, Alesha, to tell off. Right. No one will tell you then except for us. Neither labour union, nor administration. They rise you up to the highest levels. But we are old men, we've seen various careers. We can easily tell who made all the way up by himself and who was helped by the friendly wind. Never rely on friendly winds. Or you'll be forgotten in a couple of years. Only pictures will be left. Sanya, what's the time? One minute to 11. It's high time. Alesha, where is the radio? What? Turn on the radio. No need, dad. No need? Here is the broadcasting of the interview with an outstanding stakhanovite of the shipyard Alexey Zhurbin under the title &quot;My method&quot; His method. Air hammer renovated by me and the new method of work organization in a brigade gave me a chanceů Gave him a chance. To achieve prominent results. In a short period of time I managed to prove that this methodů He managed. What? Are you disgusted? You have plugged it out, but others keep listening to your boasting. They're listening and thinking: How miserable have Alesha Zhurbin become! Working class is special. There is a great responsibility upon it. Do you know what is it responsible for? Here, look. I've kept this poster for 30 years. That's what we are living and fighting for, to brush off this covering from the Earth. Here is our picture. Take it, you best worker. Remember, Alesha, the aim is to break those chains with the hammer. Come over here. Actually, Alesha, we came to congratulate you. According to the results announced at the shipyard committee, Alexey Zhurbin completed the monthly plan on 320%! Good job, Alesha! Well done. Thank you for the breakfast, will you invite us for your wedding ceremony? Miserable. Hello, Ivan Stepanovich. Did you want to see me? Ah, hello, Matvey Dorofeevich! Take a sit. Is there a point to sit down? Tell me what you wanted to day and I'll go. I'm not used to sitting in offices. Sit down and get used. You know what, Matvey Dorofeevich. The time runs fast. I remember you being a foreman of the first brigade. I was a secretary of Young Communist League at that time. Look at me now! You're starting from afar. Tell me what you want and I'll go. Matvey Dorofeevich, you are 75, if I'm not mistaken? You are mistaken, I'm 77 already. I know what you want to say. I became old and cannot keep up with the workers. Started making mistakesůAm I right? Not exactly. Right or wrongůTell me the truth, straightforwardly. I'm not afraid of the truth. Anyone complained about my work? No, no, it's not like that. Matvey Dorofeevich, who will ever dare to complain about you. You are like a grandpa for the whole shipyard. What is it said there about a monkey whose eyes got weak with the years? There's nothing to do with it. You know it well, Matvey Dorofeevich, working process will become faster according to your grandson Anton's plan. That's not about my grandson, it would be done anyway, by him or by somebody else. It's time for changes. Tell me what's your decision. Going to make me a watchman? A doorkeeper? A watchmanůWhat are you talking about? Here, Matvey Dorofeevich, you live in a good well-to-do family, the government will also take care of you. I don't want to be retired. I cannot live without the shipyard, without work. But I wasn't speaking about retirementů Then what were you talking about? I want to discuss it with you. What do you think? I cannot give you a good advice. You are appointed as our director, it's your work to decide. Our task is to follow, to obey. Good bye, Ivan Stepanovich. You see, I don't want, don't want to hear what they said to your father: move aside, old man, you got in our way. My last ship has gone to the sea, it's time for me to go, too. You won't fink out! I won't let you! I'm not trying to fink out, I'll go to the maintenance dock, I'll still be of some use. What are thinking about, what are you thinking about, you're a communist! Ilyusha, I'm thinking like a communist. The old must give a way to the young. That's what they taught us. A thing becomes old when it has already outlasted its life. Have you become old? It's better to leave in time, not waiting for the brush-off. What is that brush-off you're talking about? You've made it up. Making it up? There was a meeting of the foremen at chief engineer's. They didn't invite you. Even your Anton arranged a meeting, and you were not there, too. Chief process engineer held a meeting, too. They didn't want to distract me from work. Didn't want to distract youů if they did you wouldn't be of any use there, you'd just sit and snore. What can you, Ilya Matveevich, say about cosine and sine resistance? And Ilya Matveevich just sits and cannot say anything. You're croaking like a crow. It's disgusting even to listen. Ilyusha. We have a lot of experience, but no knowledge that is required today. Why don't we? We don't. Even me, Zhurbin? You don't. Comrade Basmanov! Comrade Zhurbin! You'll change your mind! And if you won't, you'll tear your hair in despair. Sailed away to the sea. You're out of work, too? Making latrines now. Let me help you, dad. No need. Why are you so angry? I've become stupid. Everyone around became cleverer, and it's only me who became stupid. At the shipyard, at home - everything flows past me. As if there is no Ilya Zhurbin. Where is he gone? Speak frankly, dad. Who are you to give you reports? You are meeting and discussing something, hear that? The whole plant is working, and my slipway is empty. Everything goes according to the schedule. According to it work on the new ship will begin soon. According to the schedule? And will I build it alone? Who can replace Sanya Basmanov? This randy girl? What happened to uncle Sanya? He doesn't work on the slipway any more. He quitted. Why? He said he had no knowledge, no technical education. He had enough knowledge for so many years, but nowů Yeah, it's a common thing, dad. He felt he cannot keep up, you know, that's what happened to him, it seems. And not only to him. Told you, your father became stupid. Go on, teach him, set him at the school desk. Make people laugh at him. Make our neighbors, Koshkins laugh at me. So what, I've spent 26 000 hours at the desk. And I've built 16 ships. My name is Zhurbin, don't you get it, Zhurbin! You're not proud of your family. I am! And it's broader than yours. I'm proud of every Zhurbin, Stepanov and Ivanov. Don't flinch, you are not responsible for every working man. What's the noise about? No, Viktor Ilyich, we have to come up with something different here. It would be good to discuss it with a machine operator. And what about your headman, Skobelev? Alexei Konstantinovich? I'm not sure I'll manage to bring him out of his shell. What's wrong with him? He's so indifferent. But let's try. Still, something is wrong here. We're working for more than a month, and you, Zinaida Pavlovna, are still not sure. We'll make a wooden model first. And I'll make it fromů What wood do you prefer? I don't know, Viktor Ilyich. Cedar, maybe. It's so tall and slender. Why do people think about wood by the appearance of a tree? You must treat it for its soul. Let's take a pear as an example. It's so crooked, but look what's hidden inside. The color is warm, gentle, almost bodily. It can look like a mirror when polished. Oh, god. A soul of wood. But what about human souls? Lida, dear, what's wrong? Did you get it now? You're here, too? An outstanding stakhanovite. How the hell can I be a stakhanovite? My job is over. You deserve it, idiot. What are you so angry about? Wait, I'll talk to you later in a different manner. Why aren't you married yet? Answer when I ask you. I decided against it. What? You've cheated on the government, got an apartment and then decided against it? What have you done to the girl? We didn't get along well. What? Maybe you'll tell she's not good enough for you? Stop this monkey business. Don't throw a shadow on the working class. You're the first scoundrel among Zhurbins. Shut up! You are trying to teach me, too? Why did he treat him like that? Seems that it's all because of Katya. He was dating her and then dumped her. What's his guilt here? You're like blessed, see nothing what happens around. Of course, Zhurbins. You don't even care what's going on deep inside. Alesha doesn't live with us, we cannot look after him. And I live with youů But that doesn't matter. It was Katya who dumped Alesha. For real? Do you know the club governor? I do. She's with him. Lida, are you kidding? He is not even quite youngů And we thought it was Alesha's fault. Tell me in detail. Why did he shout at you? Ah, nothing. He even hit me. Look, is it red? No-no, not at all, Alesha. Still it hurts. Auntie Lida, Viktor, Zinaida Pavlovna, come here, let's sing! Take a sit. It's Viktor who wrote this song. If we taught him music from childhoodů but who taught that to children at that time. We are workers, Zina, we were poor. And now you see, they get thousands as a salary. If we wanted to boast we'd buy a piano, and crystal chandeliers to each room. But we don't like to show off. TonyaůLidaůDunyasha, have you forgotten about the baby? It's time to feed him. Stop it! Let me go, you're acting like a child. Hi-ya, Zhurbin. Hey. Lida! Lida! Lida, where have you been? been looking for you for the whole night, we've been everywhere. Where have you gone? I left. For good. Howů When I was getting married I thought I'd have my own home, my happiness, a loving husband. Where is that home? Where is that happiness? Where is my loving husband? It feels like I'm renting a room at your place. What are you talking about, I thought thatů You thought? All of you are thinking only about ships. It's the only thing you all care about. What if I have different hobbies? Not to care a damn about me? A damn about whom? What is on that poster? Pass exchange? Heh, another exchance. Everything's changing. Yes, changing. Who doesn't care about you, who? Everyone. You, all of you. Me? It was a ten's anniversary of our wedding yesterday. Did you remember about it? Why are you standing here, let's go. I'm going. Why didn't you remind me? Why? Why do I have to remind you even this? I slept at my friend Shura's place. And she remembered. And we celebrated with her. But not our anniversary, of course. How can we be a wife and a husband? What do you mean? Lida, stop it. No, it cannot be restored. Everything is gone, forever. There is no love. And friendshipůIt's gone, too. They had no kids. She was all by herself and he was all by himself. Yeah, she was sitting at home with a long face, and now she's gone. Cabbage-headed woman. Don't put all the blame at her, it's Viktor's fault, too. Studying, inventing something all the time, and the wife is long forgotten. What if she had her own interests? What could she be interested in? Mother is right - they had no children. Shut up. No roots. And she didn't like the shipyard. Then she didn't understand she was a part of the shipbuilding process. And we didn't put her wise. No way, how could we teach her. She told me: &quot;Dunyasha, I have no personal life&quot;. What personal life could she have if she didn't have any interests? Give me scissors. So what, did she have to invent a machine for woodworks? She was a wife, she could distract him from inventing, from acting that way. I would take my Kostya like thisů Anton, don't blame Viktor. It's hard for him. There's nothing to talk about. The whole family is to blame. The whole. Don't talk down on the whole family. Go away if we're of no good. Too many critics. Ilyusha! I am the head of the family and that's what I'll say! You know, dadů Ilya, keep your mouth shut when people tell the truth. You're guilty, too. The head of the family! Dad, that's not about me. Keep silent when your father is speaking. You don't pay attention to the problems of the family members. Who will teach your sons' wives? Me? I'll manage. I see how well you manage. I'd pin your ears back, but it's such a shame. You're a granddad yourself now. It's a serious task, Matvey Dorofeevich. I cannot entrust it to a random person. So, I'm listening. Immediate manual exchange, and here are the phones. This is our interphone, it's the landline. This one is for connection with Moscow. Sometimes even our minister, Nikolay Vasilyevich, calls. So, make yourself at home, Matvey Dorofeevich, you'll stay as a director. You're going to appoint me as a watchman but speak as if you're making me a minister. Matvey Dorofeevich, what are you talking about? If you don't like the work we'll think about something else for you. Work, work, that's not about work. It's you whom I don't like, Ivan Stepanovich, you. What? You're going to criticize me, too? As if it wasn't enough for me at the party conference. All rightů So what, it's important to criticize those who stand above, not criticizing is an indulgence. You've bought two cars, one is for you, a nd the other is for your wife to do shopping, to go to the market. It's not good, not good. Ah, stop it, Matvey Dorofeevich, we have lots of gas, it's not a problem. Not a problemůBut have you heard how Vladimir Lenin once went to the hairdresser's? Everyone started to ask him to sit down and get shaved skipping the line. But he answered &quot;No, I won't skip the line.&quot; Lenin himself! And you are shaved right in the office. That's not good. You're working hard, then still get a punch in the face. Either at the meeting or in your own office. You're not being punched, you're being taught. They criticize you at the meeting and then after the voting what was in the box? They've chosen you to the party committee by common consent. Don't take it as an offense, Vanya, I'm doing it in a friendly way. They've criticized me a lot already, and you even added to that. How many things are still unspokenů Don't worry, everything will be told with the time. I've set you back, go and have a rest. Your working life is over, old man. Katya! Katya! You left meůfor good? Stop it, Alesha, stop it. I must tell you a very important thing. Here's an interesting historical anecdote The lover of Louis XIV, Madame Pompadour, was very short and wore high heels. And court nobility thought it's a new fashion. You don't listen to me. What happened? I want to tell you that we'll have a baby. What did you say? Here comes the worst. You have to do something about it immediately. To do what? You're not a child, you must understand. We don't need the baby right now, we don't need it, not in time. I told you I'm going to stop my activities at the club. On my own free will, of course. On your own will? Only bad workers are let go on their own will. I'm ashamed. And I am not. I am realist. Cold-eyed realist. They don't value me, don't understand me in this nowhereswille, it's unreasonable to make a family nest here. And stop being a whimp. It's so nasty. Nasty! Z. P. Ivanova. Is she our new head? Seems so. And where is that idler? Which one? You must know him, he always span his keys on his finger. Ah, they say he was fired. Sorry. Ah, you're still walking around? You'd better find some job for yourself. You're just like a fancy visitor. I'm sorry, but my working day is over. It's over? Then go home and lie on your coach. You're a coach yourself! To some extent. Let's postpone practice rill tomorrow, that's when I'll show you everything. Why not today? Today the line is switched off. Who did that? You must know it better, Comrade Skobelev. Wait here. Wait a moment. I'll call director, it's nuisance! A coach. A coach, for real. Connect me to the director, immediately. That's it, I told you. Hello. No, it's not Ivan Stepanovich. Ivan Stepanovich is at the committee since dinner break. Zhurbin speaking. What do you mean saying what Zhurbin? Matvey Dorofeevich Zhurbin. Stop shouting. The line? That's what you had to say from the beginning. Connect me, please, to the main power plant switchboard. Why are you, dear comrades, pull off the work of the welders? Nuisance! I said, nuisance! Stop arguing with me. It's Matvey Zhurbin speaking. What? Under my responsibility? All right, turn it on under my responsibility. Ilyusha! Where are you going? To the washhouse. What's wrong with you, Ilyusha, you went there yesterday. Oh, I forgot. Hey, my bucket is here! Going fishing? Are you crazy, old man? The ice is going to melt soon. So what? Maybe it's best to go fishing right now! Dad! Wait! I'm going with you! You can catch a cold! No, I won't! What is he planning? There is no fool to the old fool, ah, right. Oh, I tracked up here. Don't worry, come in, Ilya Matveevich, I'll make you some tea. No-no, no tea, thanks. I've just came by for a minute to see how the younger generation lives. Come in please, Ilya Matveevich. Sit down. Perfume? Maybe you have a powder, too? No, I don't use powder, Ilya Matveeich. You have lots of technical books. Right, that's because I'm an engineer. Yes, I understand. Take a seat, please. And you still remember everything you've learnt? Of course I do. And do you remember easier things, algebra, for example, or geometry? Sure. Why are you asking me about it? Just out of curiosity. By the way, could you, for example, teach others? Sanya Basmanov, for example? I don't know, I haven't tried that. I don't think so, I'm very impatient, it'll start shouting. And if the students are quiet and patient? You are asking weird questions, Ilya Matveevich. What's weird about it? I didn't have a chance to go to school. I learnt everything right on the slipway. I got a good knowledge there, but it's not broad enough to get the idea in a whole. You want me to help you? Is that impossible? Oh, I'm not even sure I can teach you. You're such a big person. By the way, there will be courses at the shipyard for old workers. No, it's not for me. This will be in several months. Could you teach me? With pleasure. In the evening, about twice a week, this won't disturb you much. But please, don't tell it to anyone. I'm too old, it's a shame. Is it a shame for you to study? You're wrong, Ilya Matveevich. Doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong, just promise it. Someone's coming here. Can I go away through the kitchen? What are you talking about, Ilya Matveevich? Hello, Alesha. Alesha! I left a book of theoretical mechanics at your place. Wait a moment, I'll bring it to you. Dad? Yeah, it's me. Why are you standing there, come in. I'll make you some tea, comrades! I told you I don't like tea! What are you doing here, dad? Just came around to see how the young people are living. You're acting like a shadowbox, dad. What are you thinking about, idiot? I told you I came here on business. Then why do you need books? You think I don't understand? Then keep quiet if you understand. It's not only your idea to start studying. Dad, I want to enter the university as a part-time student. It's too late for me to do it. All these universities. Hope you don't play around here? What are you talking about. Well, study. Viktor recommended her as a nifty girl. Hey, come over here! What? Sell me those perches. Take them. 3 roubles first! 2 roubles will be enough. What? Then go fishing by yourself. Wait. All right, give them to me. You'd better sit at your desk and study math. Some people start to study things in their 50s, not like you. So what? So what? Here, take it. I bet you've spent all day with the fishing rod. Shipyard. Who's speaking? Duty. I'll connect you to Nikolay Vasilyevich. Hey, hey, wait. He didn't even tell me who is that Nikolay Vasilyevich. Hello, comrade. Where is the director? The director? He is having rest, dear comrade Nikolay Vasilyevich. You know, he is as busy as a bee. Ask me what you want to know, I'll tell you. We haven't received a report from you today. How are the things going? A report? Hold on. What is the need for those reports? Everything goes according to the plan. No underrun. No underrun. Do you know the plan yourself? The plan? Of course I do. But how are the works going? According to the plan. Wait a moment. We want to know when the laying at the 4th slipway will start? We didn't get anyů Wait. Just a moment. Hello. Soů In 43 days first sections are going to the slipway. Right, that's the plan, but what's in reality? If it's the plan, then it will be fulfilled. When we reconstructed the shipyard after the civil war we dug the ground with our bare hands at -40C. Right, but the time has changed. You can't build a bulk carrier with bare hands. Yes, you're right, times have changed, but people are same. Sons of same people. Thus, tell your minister what I said. Please, tell me, what's your job at the shipyard? Me? The folks joke that I'm a night director. But actually I' an old worker Matvey Dorofeevich Zhurbin. Thank you, Matvey Dorofeevich, for the information. Please tell the director I'll call him again in the morning. Well, and what's your surname? Just tell him it was Nikolay Vasilyevich. He will guess, right? Of course he will. Good bye, comrade Zhurbin, thank you, all the best. All the best. Who was it? Thus, you left on your own free will, so that your work record book is clear? To ruin my reputation in such a hole? That's really too much! Where are you heading now? Somewhere people wait for me. Then, you'll settle in and then Katya will move to you, too? Katya? She left me several days ago. But she is expecting a baby, if I'm not mistaken? It's inappropriate at my age: all these diapers and everything will swallow me so that I will never get out of this swamp. Where are you going? Does Katya know you are leaving? Does she know about it? Listen, you ask too many questions. But it's a betrayal! And what else can I do? You must stay! Stop lecturing me. It's me who can teach you the life. Come back! Come back or I'll call the police! Then do it. I haven't stolen a thing. Go on, call the police, you tame man. That's not about my qualities! I don't need your teachings. You do! That's what you deserve. Let me get out, please. Did you just hit a passenger? Yes, I did. Shall I follow you to the station? With pleasure. All right, I'll explain you everything right away. Congratulations, comrade Zhurbin! Why only me? What about them? Ah, right. Congratulations. Congratulations! We also worked, did everything we could. Comrade Zhukov, I really liked working with inventors. Help me to move to another department. But who will stay here in bureau? Zinaida Pavlovna, she organized the work perfectly. No. But why? Since she came here all the accusations towards the bureau stopped. Zinaida Pavlovna will manage well. Yes, but your father wants her to work at the slipway. For real? For real. It's also a good decision. Thus we have to decide who will stay here. You or you. ThenůI don't even know. Think it over, from various points of view. You said it was Ilya Matvevich himself who wanted that? He claimed even. In that case... The I don't even know. It's up to you, make a decision. I think, Zinaida Pavlovna, I should stay here. Alexey Konstantinovich! Who ordered to accelerate the welding on the upper deck? Me. But it's me who is responsible for the ship. But I'm also responsible for it. Comrade Ivanova! Comrade Zhurbin! But the penetration can be incomplete. It will be my guilt. But the welder does his work well, there won't be any faults. Who is it? Alesha! Dad! Why did you skip the lesson yesterday? I have done all the problems, butů Dad, dad, I was enrolled at the university! Zina, they accepted me! Well done, Tonya, congratulations! To Antonina Zhurbina. First Anton, then Antonina. Education at university level becomes common in our family. Alesha says he'll get ahead of me. Experience is on his side! And experience, Zinaida Pavlovna, is an important thing. Will you go to her? But she left home, I don't know where to find her. She lives in a farm household. Go, sister, and give it to her. Well. Here. No cheating. I envy you, Tonya. I wanted to go to university, too. I wanted it so much. Then let's go together, Katya. How can I? My studies are over, Tonya. I take care about my child now. Alesha loves you very much, for real. He isů Oh, sorry, sorry, Katya, I shouldn't have said anything. Katya. Speak Tonya, speak. Nothing can be changed already. I thought he was such a good man, intelligent, different from others. I thought he loved me so much. I trusted him, sympathized him. Lonely, misunderstood, Skythian quivers, Tolstoy, Stanislavskyů Oh lord, I was such a fool. Stop it, Katya, stop it. Tonya, he was a figment of my own imagination. What do you want, Alesha? Suffering from insomnia, grandpa? Yeah, insomnia. Don't touch it. What do you want, Alesha? I have a difficult question. A difficult one? Such questions must be decided straight away. In one go. When you are looking for the answer to such a question, you must think about future, about what will happen tomorrow, not today. If you are confident about the future, then act. So, what is your question? Let's discuss it. Thank you, grandpa, you have already answered my question. Aleshaů Taxi! Taxi! Stop! Hello, comrade, could youů Oh, I'm sorry, comrade Skobelev. Get in, get in. I don't care where to go. Where is Travnikova? Masha, I'm going, just sitů Hello. Dress up, you're leaving. Where? I cannot go anywhere. I have to work tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll arrange everything. Come to senses, Alesha. What are you doing? Don't touch it! No, no, don't! You're crazy! I'm not going anywhere. Go take the baby. Go. No, I'll bring it to the car. Go to the hostess. It's so generous of you. Let's go. Alesha, I'm not going anywhere. Why? You've come here out of pity. I don't need your pity. I don't need anyone. It's my own problem, go away. I won't leave without you. Go away. Go away. You will never forgive me, anyway. Can this even be forgiven? I cannot live without you. Wait! Take this. Thank you. Vitya! Vitya! Vitya! Lida? Hello. You came back? No, I didn't. I've just came here on the way. My things are on the station. On your way? Dunyasha! Lida is back! Really? Really! Where are you going? But Iů Take the baby. You are smoking. Yes, kind ofůgot used to. And I quit. You know, it helps from insects. I'm working as a collector with geologists. I have seen a lot of things. Really? Good. We shouldn't go to our place. Why? Let's go. Is it the first day of such a good weather here? No, it's always sunny here. Except for, if I'm not mistaken, Tuesday, when it was a bit rainy. You know, it's always raining where I live. I miss sunny days. It's always sunny here. Vitya, isn't it 2 o'clock already? Not yet, it's only a quarter to 1. Anyway, I'd better go. I need to get the ticket and take my things from the check-room. I'll accompany you. No, no need. The pin could fall out. Thank you. Soůgood bye, Viktor. Thank you for coming. It's my 12th ship, Katya. I still remember each of their names and the years when they were floated out. I remember it as well as my children's birthdays. But you, Agafya Karpovnaů How did you just call me? Sorry, mother. You're a ship builder too, just like all of them. They work, and you take care of them, don't get enough of sleep. Our input is not clearly seen, our work is household. Attention! Command station speaking! The old man knows nothing. The letters were welded at night. It will be a surprise. I've come to ask you. Maybe you will let me return? No, no, I don' work with deserters, Sanya. Don't you? All right. I got an appointment to the third slipway. You are a fool. Old fool. Comrade Zhurbin! Comrade Basmanov! Here you are, the old workers, the good friends. Stand here, please. Put your hand onto the shoulder. Wellů a heart talk scene. Well. Cheer up. More. Ok, thank you. Sanya, have I offended you by calling you an old fool? You think I can't say the same about myself? I'm also a fool. An old fool. After arms off. How is it? Congratulations. Thank you. Hello, uncle Sanya. You did a good thesis work. It's not my own work, it's a general certificate for the whole shipyard! Right, Anton, for the whole shipyard. That's what I say: working class is a basis of the whole life. Steadily builds, steadily provides with food and clothes. For the whole world. You know what's the main idea? Not to give in but live with zeal. Look, it's starting to move. Sanya. Attention! Command station speaking! Cast off ripping levers. Matvey Zhurbin Look, Dorofeevich, whose name is over there. Why do you think it's in my honor? Maybe it's his name? He is also Matvey Zhurbin. He has a long happy life ahead.
