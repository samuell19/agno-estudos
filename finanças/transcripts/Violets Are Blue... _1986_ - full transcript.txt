(PEOPLE CHATTERING) Augusta, don't take more than $2.00! Where are you off to? I'm going camping. Did you tell your mother? MAN ON RADIO: My kind of weather, sunshine and a high of 96 for the next couple of days as we approach the end of the summer of '69, here in Ocean City, it's great to be in love... (SHIP'S HORN BLOWING) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) HENRY: What did you tell your mom this time? That I was going camping on Assateague. With me? Not with you. With Sara Mae. Oh. Did she believe you? Why not? Sara Mae and me go camping all the time. Sara Mae and I. Sara Mae and I. Smile! (GIGGLING) Oh! Are you scared? Of what? Of leaving. No. Just scared I'll never get out of here. Everybody keep coming around to say good bye. My mother cries every time she looks at me. Thousands Throng Ocean City Beaches on Holiday Weekend, by Henry R. Squires. You got a by-line! Big deal. The exact same piece my father has written for the last 20 years. His going away present for me. All he let me do was change the number in the crowd count. He wouldn't print the piece I did about the blacks in Fenwick. That was too controversial. Oh, God, Henry, you're not gonna be working for him the rest of your life. You'll only be here four more days. You'll have plenty of time to write about important stuff. Uh-huh. Yeah. Like, waitress discovered in secret love nest on Assateague island with sex-crazed journalist. Yeah, like that. Why won't you come with me. What would I do in Boston? You could go to school too, you know. I just got out of school. I don't want to spend another four years sitting in chairs. (HORSE NEIGHING) You gonna spend it in an airplane galley. Yeah, I get to see the world. GUSSIE: Do you realize the discounts airline employees get? We could go to Venice and eat spaghetti and peaches. (COUGHING) And make love in the back of abandoned churches. That sounds good. I thought you'd like that. (CRUNCHING) HENRY: Not the apples. (GUSSIE GIGGLING) Oh, God. Oh, God, Henry. Oh, we'll go to Venice, Henry. We'll eat in little restaurants and ride in gondolas and see the pretty sights. When you finish school, we can live anywhere in the world we want to. We'll be together all the time. We will. Won't we? We will. I love you, Gussie. I love you, too. (GUNFIRE) MAN: Don't take your eyes off him! What did you find? A diamond. They're pretty. What's your doll's name? Kathleen. Kathleen. That's a pretty name. WOMAN: I told you not to talk to strangers. Don't need anyone taking your picture. No one knows your face less likely harm will come to you. (SIREN WAILING) (GIRL CRYING) Come on. Sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Hey, ma. (EXCLAIMING) Oh! Oh! Ralph! Ralph! I don't... I just don't believe it. I just... Look! Look! Look who's here! Oh, honey. It's good to see you. Let me get my bags. Oh. Ralph, you get them. You get her bags. Oh. Oh, I just don't... Let's go in. You know they... Everybody's here. Sally's here? Yes, everybody's in here. Come on. Yoo-hoo! Oh, I can't believe it! Gussie Sawyer, what are you doing here? Came to see my niece. Oh, God, you boys have grown! Clean all your hands, boys. Don't get grease on her. Hi, Gussie. Hi. You've been gone so long, I don't recognize you. Oh. Look at here. Oh, hi, Mary Augusta. Hi. I'm your aunt. Oh. Oh. Oh, there are presents in the bag. I--I still just can't believe that you just, just came and walked in that door and you didn't even let us know. ETHEL: And here I am in my house dress. You know, I almost didn't know you. You've gotten so skinny. Mom, I'm not skinny. I was same as I did when I left. Well, you look skinny. Maybe it's you that's changed, Ethel. Oh, Ralf. Well, I know, I've gained a little weight. Oh, thank you, honey. Well... Oh. Let's see now. Let's see what we got here. Oh, there's two matching things here. (BABY CRYING) Oh, this girl just wants her grandma. That's it. Come on now. We'll just go for a little walk. That's it. There we go. Well, let me give you a real hug. Hey, guys! Come on. Come on. Sit down. Everything's getting cold. Come on, come on. Boys, come on. Let's have something to eat. Oh, crabs! I don't believe it. Oh! Oh, God. Well, there's a sailboat race this Saturday. Summer finals. Maybe you could get into it. You think I could? Well, maybe you can get your dad to race. SARA: What will they do for a boat. Oh, Phillip got an extra boat. The big red one with a crab on it? Not me. Oh, come on! GEORGE: Oh, he's just being ornery. As usual. He's dying to get into that race. Then get us that boat. All right, let's get this thing wet. Come on. Listen, put on some sunscreen! You're all going to get burned out there. Bye! Oh, come on, Sawyer. Don't have to tell me. Yeah, we're going to kick your ass. (ALL CLAMORING) ANNOUNCER: Ok, let's get this thing started. One, two, two and a half... (GUN FIRES) (ALL SHOUTING) Loosen the jib sheet, Gussie. Pull it back! Go on, pull it back! I got that. RALPH: Let's run it past those guys. Yo! Come on! Let's go! We got the wind on our side. All right! Get going. Good line. Cut off the lines. GUSSIE: Come on, Pa! Let it go! Who's the skipper of this boat? Hey, Sawyer, why don't you just jack it up and live with it, huh? TONY: Fly away. Screw yourself. Where'd the wind go? A little more. I got it. How's that? Yeah, that's good. MAN: Ready to approach buoy. MAN 2: Coming about! Ready to come about. RALPH: Okay, mate, get ready to tack. Coming about. This is some kind of sailing, I'll tell you, babe. (WHOOPS) We're in the clear, Dad. Yeah, we got it now. Come on, Gussie. Let's fly! We need to keep that jib inside if we're gonna catch those guys. RALPH: Hey, Henry. Get out of our way. We're coming through! HENRY: Whoa. Watch your head. Dad! We got them now, babe! You okay, son? What happened? RALPH: We beat them! ANNOUNCER: Let's hear it for the Sawyers... (CROWD CHEERING) We'll kick your ass next time, Sawyer, you lucky bastard! Next time there's no more Mr. Nice guy! (PEOPLE CHEERING) RUTH: Addy. Syrup's in the cupboard. When are you gonna quit sulking? An accident. You know, your dad, as big as he is, slipped off that boat just as easily as you did. Come on, Mom. I mean it. Your mother's right. Get over it. Cheer up. Brooding over it isn't going to help anything either. It happened. It's over and done with. You know, you can't always be the winner, sweetheart. Better get used to it right now. RUTH: So, what's on the agenda today? I'm gotta go to the office. On a Sunday? This is getting to be a regular thing, huh? HENRY: I've only done half my lead article for Tuesday. What about you, sweetie, what are you doing? Uh, I'm taking tickets for Mr. Carter. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know, he's really mad about what you said in your article about Assateague and the condos. See, now, he told you that, huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm not too popular with any of the merchants association now. Oh. Why, though? Well, I guess because they think developing Assateague Islands' gonna bring more people to the area. But I think it's gonna ruin the coastline. And I'm right. Absolutely are. No people are gonna come here if they don't have any beaches. How the hell are those people supposed to get out there anyway? They want to build a causeway. Didn't you read my editorial last week? It's all right, no one else did either. RUTH: I'm gonna read it. I've been meaning to. It's upstairs. That would destroy the ecology of the entire marine basin. Nah. They wouldn't be allowed to do that, would they? I'll tell you. The guy who left the island to the state in his will, 50 years ago, stipulated that it was for the ponies to run wild in. They couldn't build. Now, with the ponies being as sick as they've been, they're contesting the will. That was excellent French toast. You're not having any? Right, all I need is a bunch of syrup and flour. I'm getting so fat. You look fine to me. Hey. Dishwasher. Well, good morning. Good morning. Oh. Mr. Grason called from The Dispatch. And he wants to take a picture of you and dad on the boat for next week's paper. I don't want my picture taken. Huh? I'm on vacation. Well, most people are dying to get their pictures in the newspaper. Exactly. What? Nothing. Well, you'd have something to show your grandchildren. I don't have any grandchildren. You will, honey. Now, do you want some eggs? You want some eggs? No, thanks. Well, then, some toast? Here's some right hot. It's right here. I'll eat after a while. Yes, but it's all hot. It won't... Well, she's been that way since she was born. You don't expect to change here now. ADDY: Me and Mr. Carter is just gonna have to have a talk. Mr. Carter and I. Mr. Carter and I. You're gonna talk to him, huh? Yeah. Well, you be careful how you handle him. All right. People don't like to be backed into corners they can't get out of. Gotta leave them a little room to save face. Okay? Okay, but just a little. Okay. Bye. Don't slam the... What? You're a nice man. A lot of good it does me. Oh, well, you know, people might just surprise you, vote that thing down. Yeah, that'd be a nice surprise. Talk to you later. All right. Don't... (BELL RINGING) Hi. We're open. Well... Yes, if... If it's relevant, I'll reprint it. Yeah. What? Yeah, well, send it over. Yeah, let me look at it. Yeah. Look, I got to go. I'll call you back as soon as I look at it. Right. Okay. Yes, all right. Bye. That was our mayor, Wilfred Powell. Willie's the mayor? Yeah, and I'm pretending to run the newspaper. Well, how the hell are you? I'm fine. You look fine. So do you. I hear you have a kid. No, actually, I saw him at the race. Yeah, I heard you were there. He's gorgeous. Is he all right? Oh. Yeah, he's fine. The good thing about kids is there's always a next time. So how are you? Okay. I've been running. So I probably look awful. No, you don't look awful. It must be 100 degrees out there. Well, how are you? Why do you keep asking me that? I don't know. What are you doing here? I'm on vacation. Look, I didn't mean to barge in on you like this. Oh, no, no, that's okay. It's no problem. Don't be silly. Come on. Oh, my God. Come here. Gussie, this is Ben Mahanes Jr. This is Augusta Sawyer. Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you. I know your work and I respect it. The last time I saw you, you were about this big. Oh, well, it's good to meet you. Tell your dad hello for me. I will. Well, I'd better go so you can get some work done. We can talk another time. Wait, uh... Why don't you come to dinner? I'd love to. Great. When? Tonight. No, tomorrow night. Okay. What time? 8 o'clock. Great! Where? Oh, it's my parents' old house. You know, up Alden road. Yeah. Well, I'll see you then. I want you to meet Ruth and Addy. I'd like that. Bye. RALPH: What are you doing, babe? What does it look like I'm doing? Driving around in circles? Don't you have anything better to do? No! Get out of that thing! I got to open up. Get out of here! (SHIP HORN BLOWING) RUTH: Didn't you sleep? Thinking about the article. Oh, did you finish it? No. Gussie Sawyer came by the office. Your old girlfriend? What did she want? To say hello. She's in town visiting her folks. I invited her to dinner tonight. You didn't. I did. Here? Where else? Oh, what time? 8:00. Henry, you might have asked me. Oh. Do you want me to ask her not to come? No. I just want her to be short, fat, and ugly. (CHUCKLING) Hi. You must be... Augusta sawyer. Augusta sawyer. Ruth. Hi. Well, come on in. Henry just had to run out to the store. (BLENDER WHIRRING) I love your kitchen. Oh, thank you. I didn't plan it, you know. It just sort of came together from odds and ends. It's my nesting instinct coming on I think I actually do it the way birds do it, from bits and pieces of things, you know, other people throw away. I go to rummage sales a lot. I'm starting to like the smell of paint stripper. It's really just, uh... It's a big jumble. It's wonderful. What are we talking about me for? You're the celebrity. I'm hardly a celebrity. Oh, in this town you are a celebrity. You know, Henry checks just about every photo to see if you took it. Sometimes I, I catch him. He's got the magazine upside-down to see if it's one of yours. Where is Henry? Why don't I get Addy. He's upstairs. He's just messing with his fish tanks. Why don't you go on the porch. It's a little cooler there. Okay. The oven's been on all day. No, just... Well, make yourself at home. I'll be right back. Thank you. (CARNIVAL MUSIC) (DOG BARKING) RUTH: Oh, dear, is it too chilly out here now? I'm fine. This is Addy. Hi. HI. Miss sawyer. Gussie. I'd forgotten how beautiful it is from over here. I think I just saw some heat lightning. Oh, yes? I wonder what causes that? Then we're sure to get a thunderstorm. It's a good thing I didn't plan a barbeque. You know, it's electrical discharges in the atmosphere. It's like two clouds banging together. I never knew that. Our house scientist, huh. He's responsible for all the fish aquariums and jars of half-dead crabs that are all over my house. Oh, mom. Give him half a minute he'll talk your ear off about spawning patterns and weak fish and... Wanna see my tanks? Sure. After dinner, honey. Good evening. Sorry. If I would ever to get the right wine. He didn't have French wine. I thought that's what you drank. So you've all met? Mmm-hmm. Yes. Well, let's get drunk. Don't be foolish, Henry. Nobody wants to get drunk. I do. HENRY: Here's to Gussie and Ruth and to Addy, who finally washed his hands for the first time in three weeks. What is this stuff? It's gazpacho. It's cold. It's supposed to be. Cold soup? HENRY: Addy, just eat it. I heard you've been in a lot of places. Yeah, I guess I have. You been in wars? A few. ADDY: My mom said that wars are no place for women. Addy, I didn't say that. Well, I didn't. I said, um... What I said, was I didn't... I didn't feel like I would ever do what you do. How much money do you make? Addy! It's not a question you ask someone. Well, never enough. Why not? RUTH: You just don't. HENRY: That's right. How much money do you make? Not enough. So, um, it's been a while since you've been back home? I've been back on and off over the years but this is the first real vacation I've had in about 13 years. I'm 13. RUTH: And you live in Paris? Um-hmm. Before that, I was based out of New York. Oh, New York! I don't know how people live in New York. Weren't you frightened? I mean, I could never live in New York. I mean, all those people packed together. ADDY: But Dad said you used to be a stewardess. I was, until I had a few pictures published at Invite magazine and I realized I could make a living as a photographer. So that was the end of my stewardessing days. Gussie, more wine? Yes, please. Thank you. Thank you. The soup's wonderful. Oh, thank you. It's very easy, really. It's basically just salad thrown in a blender. We used the fresh tomatoes from our garden. I miss that, tomatoes, sweet corn, clams. I have some fresh clams in the kitchen I can get you some. No, this is plenty. Thank you. Are you sure? Mmm-hmm. I guess we're ready for dinner. Addy? Got it? Yeah. I'll get the other bottle. She's pretty. So are you. I think Addy's in love with her. Ruthie, you jealous? No, of course not. Where are you going? To Wally's to spend the night. Does your mother know? Sure. Yeah, we-- we discussed it. Come here. Give me a kiss. Have a good time. Nice meeting you, and I hope I see you again. Hope so. Bye. See you. Good night. ADDY: Good night. God, I just can't believe how big he's gotten sometimes. He's a great kid. Thanks. Only yesterday he was that big. He hasn't even let me see him naked in almost two years. That was a pretty strange thing to say, wasn't it? Well, you know what I mean, if you spend so many years bathing and changing, just feeling a little child's body, and suddenly you can't see it anymore, it's... I'm kind of sad about it. You'll understand when you have yours. Well, I should go. Oh, no, it's early yet. Oh, I--I have a long walk. I really enjoyed dinner. You walked? You can't walk home. No, Gussie let me drive you. Oh, really, I'm fine. I'll drive you. I really enjoyed it. Well, it was really a pleasure. I hope to see you again before you leave. I hope so. Good night. You sure you won't let me drive you? Thanks anyway. Good night. Good night. Oh, take her home. Go with her. (THUNDER RUMBLING) HENRY: Gussie! Let me give you a ride home. I'm all right. You're gonna get soaked down here. I don't care. I like the rain. I can get home by myself. Please, go back. What's the matter? Nothing. It's not much further. Henry, I'll be fine from here. Please, just go back. What's wrong? Nothing! Something's the matter. Nothing's the matter. I just want to be alone. Gussie. Why did you do that to me? Do what? Invite me there. To see you have a perfect life? What are you talking about? Why didn't you just leave me alone? I wanted to see you again. Well, you've seen me. Let me explain! You should have explained a long time ago! I tried! I asked you to come back when my father died. I was gonna come back. Were you? Well, we'll never know, will we? Gussie, do you think I would have got married if I thought you were coming back? Ruth got pregnant. By herself? Gussie! Look, I didn't plan for this to happen the way it did. Didn't plan it. You've got a home and a family, and you goddamn love them. And you have nothing? Look at your life. I don't even have a cat. I don't feel sorry for you. This is enough. Let go of me! Gussie! (DOOR CLOSES) Hi, Kate. Hi, Henry. Tony! Yo-ho-ho! Isn't he cute? Where are the kids? They're home. We're celebrating. Are you pregnant again? Pregnant, no, bite your tongue! Hey, you see, Gussie, you and the old man kicked ass in that race. Hey. He's got a new job working on the condos at Assateague. They were approved? All but the formalities. Hello. That's silly. GEORGE: Are they hiring? You looking? You're reading my mail. Who do I talk to? TONY: Come on, I'll introduce you to Vernon. Do you remember Barbara Turner? She's afraid to come talk to you because she thinks you don't remember her. I don't remember her. She was in your gourmet class. She used to date Gordon Trimper. Who's Gordon Trimper? Oh, this reminds me of high school. Everybody's dancing, and we're sitting around and gabbing. (WOMEN CHATTERING) How you doing, Henry? Oh, hi. Hi. How are you, Squires. I'm fine. MAN: Hey, Henry, what happened to you Saturday? I lost a fin on you. Hey, Squires! Well, we finally kicked your ass. Yes you did. Don't count on doing it again. Well, you better talk to my sister-in-law about that. All right. Henry, can I get you your usual? No, no. I'll come talk to you later. Make way for the champion. Sit down. Hi, Gussie. Hi. Henry. Hey. GEORGE: How about if I get you a cool one? Oh, thanks. Gussie, give him a few sailing lessons, huh? Hey, Squires. GEORGE: Hey, Bill, give me a cool drink. I been meaning to talk to you. Why don't you just ease up on them condos, huh? (STUTTERING) Every time I pick up a paper, you're telling us to turn them down. You should. Oh, yeah? Why? Well, it's gonna destroy the ecology of the whole area. It's to them high words? "Ecology." Well, there ain't no ecology, man. Nor jobs. GEORGE: I mean, what about them people who've lost their work when Del Monte closed down? They need this work. Yeah. You think they care about some flea-ridden ponies when their kids got nothing to eat? Huh? Tony... TONY: Huh. ...you gotta think ahead. It's not just ponies. The whole fishing industry will be destroyed. Our government's limiting the fishing now. Exactly. Limiting it is the only way the fish are gonna come back. TONY: Oh. And in the meantime, in the meantime, how we supposed to make a living? Huh? George, tell them. When them mink coat liberals up in Washington, D.C. let you go out fishing one day a week, mind you, one a day week, how much fish you catch? Not very... How many damn fish you catch? Not very much. Yes, thank you. Not very much! TONY: I can't even make a living. My damn wife's got to work. My damn wife's got to work! Damn it! TONY: Who the hell does he think he is, huh? Henry, that layout's got to be to the printer by 10:00. Right. Thanks for the beer. Good to have you back. (CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING) Mr. Sawyer? Henry. How are you? Good. How are you? Fine. My boy left his, uh, jacket at the bumper cars. Did you see it? Don't know nothin' about it. GUSSIE: Pop? George needs to talk to you. Hi. Hi, Gussie. I'm looking for Addy's jacket. Maybe he left it in the bumper cars. You know where? Well, if somebody found it, they'd probably, uh, put it in the office. I'll go with you. Okay. Let me get my sweater. There's no jacket. I know. Just wanted to see you again. I'm glad. So, where do you want to go? I don't know. Where do you want to go? Where can we go? (PEOPLE WHOOPING) (LAUGHING) Oh, I'd forgotten how tidy this beach is. It's so closed off. I guess that's why we all felt so certain here. You never felt certain. I did, too. Let's not fight. Okay. At least you got out of here. Henry, you have a wonderful life, you've got a wife and a beautiful son. You run the paper. Yeah. But you did it... What we always dreamed of. You went out there, and you did it. Yeah. But when I get home, all my plants will be dead. How come you never married, Gus? I had a few close calls. (SIGHING) When your father died and you asked me to come back, I... I couldn't. I wasn't ready. I know. It was just too soon. I know. It all happened so fast. I didn't understand much about anything then. I see it all a little better now. Good. Maybe, you can explain it to me. Gussie, are we going to pretend the other night didn't happen. No. I missed you. Don't. Please, Henry. What happened, happened. And, maybe it's, you know, it's even forgivable, or understandable, or whatever you say about stuff like that. But there's no place for us to go from here. I've only got a few more days here. Stay. Just a little longer. It's too late. It's too late. Isn't it? How's it goin'? Alright. Want some iced tea? My dad said you came by to see me. Yeah, see, I'm applying as a special student at Woods Hole Marine Institute. And, they need a recommendation. And, I was wondering if you would write one up for me. I'll be glad to. What, uh, what should it say? Oh, just stuff about how highly motivated I am. (CHUCKLES) Okay. You got it. Were you in school with my dad? Yeah. How come you look so young? You really think I look young? Yes. My mom looks much older than you. Are things okay at home? Yeah, it's okay. Hi. Tired? Hmm. You want a backrub? No. Come to bed. I got some work to do. I'll be up in a while. MAN ON TV: ...Into second base with a double... Hey, pop. Hi. Who's winning? They are. I'll get a beer. I forgot to tell you, you got a phone call from a guy in Paris. He wants to know when you're coming back to work. The number's on the pad in the kitchen. I know. I already talked to him. I'm not ready to go back to work yet. I like it here, Pop. Well, you shouldn't have moved out in the first place. I tried to tell you that once, but nobody could ever tell you anything. (SIGHING) Sometimes I wish I'd stayed here like Sally did. You were born with ants in your pants. Every time I took you girls sailing, from the time you could talk, you'd be the one wanting to head for the horizon. Sally'd be crying to go home. I asked for more time off. What for? I'm not ready to go back to work yet. That kid was around to see you. Addy? Squires' boy. What did he say? That he'd come back. He's married, Gussie. Remember that. Well, season's over next Saturday. I'll have more time to spend with you. What if we took the boat out together, huh? That would be nice, Pa. Good. MAN ON RADIO: Maryland transit district bus drivers have reached a tentative agreement, bringing to an end fears of a possible strike. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Henry. No, I haven't had lunch. I'd love to. 15 minutes. Bye. God, I love this boat. Hold this, would you? Can you cook and crew at the same time? You're the only good person over ten who likes peanut butter and jelly. How do you want yours? Rare. (GUSSIE GIGGLING) Whoa! I got it. Does this feel like old times or what? Yes. Do you believe what they want to do here? Yeah. I can believe anything. You're talking to a very jaded lady. About as jaded as Tinker Bell. I've seen people blow each other up over a piece of land, Henry. You know what I thought about the whole time, while I was in Venice? What? Don't you remember? How it was always going to be you and me, sailing the Mocking-Bird down the Great Canyon. You and I. Oh, Henry. It's funny being here, isn't it? As if nothing has changed. Yeah. We're still hiding. Do you realize in all the years I've known you, we've never had breakfast at a table, or made love in a bed. Or made love on a table, had breakfast in bed. Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I think about what it would be like, to live in a house with you. Have coffee with you in the morning. Supper with you at night. Take showers with you. Yell at you, for forgetting to take out the garbage. I would never forget to take out the garbage. I would never yell. Hmm. I'm going back to work, Henry. When? I don't know. Next week probably. They've got that deal for me to do a series on kids. We just have to set a writer. You're really going? I don't belong here, Henry. I came running back, thinking I was coming home, but it's not home to me anymore. I forgot about the time I lived here I was just trying to think of ways to get out. It's weird. I look at sally, and she looks so happy. She's married. And so are you. I love you, Gussie. I love you, too. (HORSES NEIGHING) (GUN FIRING) Shit. What the fuck is that? (PEOPLE YELLING) Came from over there. Where? Over that bluff. Wait, Gussie. Don't let them see you. What are they doing? I don't know. HENRY: That Jeep is from Martin & Company. The guys who want to build the condos. I gotta get closer. What are they injecting into 'em? I don't know, but it's not medicine. God, I can't see shit from here. Gussie, hey. Take a shot of Martin & Company with the needles. MAN: Hold still! Hold still! (HORSES NEIGHING) Hey! What are you doing here? HENRY: Gussie, let's go. Henry, the film. All right, let's go. I don't like having my picture taken. I don't wanna have to persuade you to give me that camera and move on. Get it. No. Lady, you're just making yourself a lot of trouble. Give it to him, Gussie. Thank you. Yes. GUSSIE: Do you think that's the right picture? Absolutely. Is the headline big enough? Mmm-hmm. Picture tells the whole story. We did it! I gotta call the printer. Jim, we're done. I can have it to you in 25 minutes. Is that okay? Great. And can you print up 10,000 more copies? No, it's just for this week. Well, ask him. Yeah. (SIGHING) Re-write that whole piece from the kids point of view. What kids? The piece you're doin' in the Middle East. The kids you're gonna go photograph. Yes, Jim. That's great. Alright. Yes, I'll be right there. Bye. Henry, would you work with me? Would you write the story? Would they hire me? I don't know why not. You've been syndicated. You've written for The Washington Post. You're as good as any other writers that I've ever worked with. Oh, God! Henry, it would be a week in the Middle East, and a week in Central America. Oh, God! If we could make it work. It would be so wonderful. So wonderful. Call 'em. (DOOR CLOSING) Where's he going? I sent him to the office on an errand. I wish you wouldn't have done that. Breakfast is ready. I'm sorry. (SIGHING) What's the matter, Ruth? You must think I'm a fool. Ruth, don't. Who took those pictures? Gussie Sawyer. What were you doing with Gussie Sawyer on Assateague. We were working. I asked her to do a job for me. Don't lie to me. You've never lied to me. (SNIFFLING) (DOOR CLOSING) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Good morning. Can I help you? Hi. You look tired. Yeah. I didn't get a lot of sleep. Peggy, this is the one. The Sun picked up our story. Great. The governor's office called and asked for an injunction to stop the building and they're setting up a special commission to look further into the matter. We did it! Yeah, I guess we did. I talked to New York. And? Congratulations. You've got the job. You're kidding! Just like that? Just like that. Wednesday, we go to Paris to talk to the bureau chief. He's going to set our itinerary. He's talking about Lebanon and Israel, end of the week we'll find out what we'll do, they'll send us down to Central America. I can't get outta here by Wednesday. I mean, I've gotta get someone to run the paper. I've gotta talk to Ruth and Addy. Well, how much time do you need? I don't know. You just told me about this. A week? No. I... I thought you wanted to do this, Henry I do. I just... Look, they want us in Beirut on Friday, there's war. It's not gonna wait on us. This is the real world, Henry. Look, I'm not askin' you to give up your whole life. We're talking about two weeks. I think two weeks is the widest reference you ever had to consider. Have you ever stayed anywhere longer than two weeks? Gussie, I'm sorry. Please, please listen to me. I'll get somebody else. Ruth knows. I stayed here last night. If I go, I can't come back. You don't have to go. I wanna go. I want this job, and I want to be with you. What time is the flight? 10 o'clock. I'll be there, okay? Okay. Together? HENRY: Yes. She got me the job. She would do the pictures, and I would write the piece. We work well together. No doubt. Ruth, it's a national magazine. It could lead to other jobs. We could use the money, and I can write about something a little more important than sewer assessments! You can screw your girlfriend in exotic cities all over the world! Ruth, listen to me. We're talking about a job. Oh! Is that what we're doing? Don't condescend to me, Henry. I am not an idiot. If you're going, go, but don't lie to me, or yourself. I can't compete with her. You were meant for bigger things than I was, Henry. You've always known that. If it hadn't been for your father dying and me getting pregnant, you wouldn't be stuck here in this shitty little town. And, I don't wanna be the one to keep you here. And, I sure as hell won't apologize for liking it here. If it's too small for you, get the hell out. But for God's sake, be a man. Tell the truth. (SIGHING) Pop? I brought your lunch. Thanks. Set it down there. Need any help? No, I... I've been putting these things up and getting them down for 30 years. I guess I can manage. You know I'm leaving tomorrow, don't you? Yeah. Well, uh, if you don't need any help... Augusta, what the hell do you think you're doing? Doing about what? You know what I'm talking about. Going off with Henry Squires. Pop, I'm not going off with Henry. We have an assignment to work on a story together. We're partners. Writer, photographer. Photographer, writer. It's no big deal. But this time it's different, Gussie. This time you think your partner's gonna solve whatever you think is wrong with your life. And what do you think's wrong with my life? I don't know. You tell me. Well, as a matter of fact I think I've got a pretty terrific life. And, I've worked long and hard to get it just the way it is. I think you have a fine life, Gussie, I just don't want to see you get hurt. Do you know how long it took me to get assigned with the Paris bureau, Pop, hmm? Eight years. Eight years of working seven days a week, for months at a time. You know, I missed every Christmas except one, for the past 13 years. You know why? Do you know why, Pop? No, Gussie. Why? Because, I want to be the best. To be the best, you got to be there. So, I'm there. That's why. The price you have to pay for it, it's worth it to you? Most times it is. Then why do you need Henry? I don't need Henry! I'm giving him a chance, Pop. This is a big break for him. It's something he's always wanted. It's what you want, Gussie. Not what Henry wants. You chose it. Henry chose something else a long time ago. He didn't choose it. It just happened. That's the way we choose, Gussie. We let it happen. It's two weeks. It's just, it's just two weeks. I think you deserve something better. I love him, Pop. I love him, pop. Good oatmeal. It's the same oatmeal I've been making for 14 years. Come on, let me give you a ride. No. No. I'll be back in two weeks. Hold the fort till then. I found your gray sweater. It was in Addy's room... I put it on the bed. (BABY CRYING) You're okay, babe. Hello, Henry, how are you? I read your article about Assateague. Thanks. You have a nice trip now. Thanks. Did you check your things all the way through? Are you okay? Yeah. You're so quiet. I'm always quiet before I go to Paris, for the first time. My mother washed and ironed all my clothes, and packed my suitcase for me. She made me a couple of peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches. WOMAN ON PA: Proceed to the aircraft for immediate boarding. Flight 1512. I know. I can't. I belong here, you know? Last boarding call for Flight 1512. Always be you and me. You and I.
