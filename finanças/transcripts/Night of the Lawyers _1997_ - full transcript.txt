This is the call list, were these people, I just, oh look! - I don't have time for this - No, really, look! - Security! Still here? Security! - Oh, no! No, no, that's fine, I'm outta here. I'm gone, I just go home. - [Nurse] Security! - Oh my God, he went that way! - What is going on? (footsteps) - Well, here we are. - The fabled Monday strategy meeting, senior partners only. Is this is? Is Moriarty gonna make me a senior partner? - Uh, no, not today. He's just testing you, see whether you measure up. - What do I say? - Always say, the right thing. Moriarty doesn't sufferer fools, gladly. Oh! (exhales) - Mm, oh. - Here we go, - Okay, well thank you. (jazz music) - He's expecting you. - [Moriarty] The next with gathering is Saturday, I've personally invited some of you along. I want absolutely nothing to go wrong, is that clear? You have that list of legislative action for family and divorce law? - [Man] Who's gonna divorce, designed for a maximum indication. - Longstry, what about the criminal law legislation? Excellent. - [Man] Our people have penetrated all-- - Little gathering? - It's big, really big. Some of the biggest lawyers in the country are gonna be there. Nobody's ever tried anything like this before, there's no stopping Moriarty once we put this plan into action. - [Man] We'll be able to make any decision without first consulting a lawyer. Preferably a Moriarty lawyer. - I notice that your Qantro verse Lee malpractice is coming up? Congratulations on getting that trial so soon, most inventive. - We'll crush him like a insect. - I want him more than crushed. - Okay, we'll pull off his wings and legs and let him die slowly. (All chuckles) - I want vegetables on that jury. - Vegetarians? (rumbles) (dishes clattering) - Vegetables not vegetarians, no one with a IQ over 65. - It's done. - Excellent. (All chuckles) (ambient chatter) - Crutches, crutches! (exclaims in pain) - Practice! - Huh? Practice! - Oh, Jury! (exclaims in pain) - Are you okay? - Uh, yeah. I haven't been sleeping well. - Just be alert and look sharp, eh? Hey! We're going to show the jury what a bullshit scam for money this is, kick some butt and walk out winners. Don't worry! - [bailiff] All rise, circa court for Spotsylvania County is now in session, the honorable Roger Tanny presiding, please be seated. (electronic beeping) - [Sir] Your report? - [Alien] uh, well sir, I'm actually blending in very nicely, it's a incredibly smooth transition. Tell you the truth, sir, I'm beginning to feel like I'm one of them. But I do have a slightly larger problem, sir, I no longer posses the device. - [Sir] What happened? - Well, I've seemed to have lost it. - [Sir] Abandon the original mission, your new objective is retrieve the AAD. You may be in great danger without it. - [Alien] Well, sir, I was just wondering, what, just hypothetically of course, what happens if I, uh, can't find it? - [Sir] You wont be able to return without the device. - [Alien] Aha, I see, ha. - [Sir] If you do not retrieve the AAD we will have to destroy the entire city with you in it, we have no choice. - [Alien] Uh, yes, sir, then it is very fortunate that I have all these leads, sir. (electronic beep) - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, your honor and we'd like to know if it's possible to award more money than was originally asked for by our plaintiff. (cheering) (laughs) - Whoo! - Oh, baby! You know where we're going now? - To the talk shows? - All the talk shows! - Order, order! This court is adjourned. Well, Doctor Lee, I don't know about you but had a tough day. Better luck next time. (exclaims in pain) You Moriarty guys put on quite a show. - Hey, gotta earn my 60%. - 60% of the damages? - You are in line for a little legal education, eh? come with me, we got some talking. Listen, you made some good moves in there, Ed, you should be proud of yourself. - Well, I had to be my best, I was up against Moriarty, wasn't I? - Well listen, there's lawyers and then there's more lawyers and then there's Moriarty lawyers. Let's go get us a drink, eh? - Okay. (rock music) (inaudible chatter) - Remember me? - Sorry, no. - I bet you're the only guy in here who's not a judge or a lawyer. My son, the emergency room. - Um, baseball, busted lip, six stitches? We had to keep him over night, right? - Right. - Hows he doing? - He's fine, thanks. So, what are you having? - Uh, anything, beer. - You know, I never had the opportunity to thank you, properly. - What do you think about working for the Moriarty law firm? - Sounds good but uh, I'm not sure I have that killer instinct that you Moriarty guys have. - Wise up, you're too bright a guy to be working on a salary. Listen, Moriarty is planning something big. I can't tell you what it is just now but, believe me this is a major big time move. Eh, I like you, I want you in on it. - I'm game. - So hows everything at your place? - You know how it is, you guys sue 'em and we defend 'em. (laughs) Here's to a little pre-enterprise and the good doctor. - So what's going on here, Ed? You're joining Moriarty? Did you make a deal with this scumbag before my trial? Did you? Answer me! - Relax, Bob, sit down for one minute. It's not what you think on the job offer. - Hey, doc help me out, it hurts when I do this! (laughs) - When I'm handling your case, I'm your lawyer I fight for you. It's just that, lawyers are trained to see both sides of the picture. - Don't give me that lawyer double talk, you lost an open and shut case for me, Ed and now you're working for the other side! - You heard things out of context, when I work for you I'm on your side! It's a, I fight for you, I'm your lawyer! - I heard you, Ed, it's the truth! - It's not true if you can't prove it. - Whenever you're ready doctor. - I'll take care of this, I don't think you can afford to pick up any more tabs. (laughs) Hey listen, I'll knock five million off the jury award, we'll settle the whole thing right here right now, no more hassles! - What so every time I cover the ER for the next 50 years, I'll be working for that slug who sued me and you? I'd rather be dead. - That's your choice! (laughs) - Look, Bob, I was working for you. Now I just might work for the other side, there's nothing illegal about that. (sighs) (electricity surging) - I'm sorry, but I want all you lawyers out of my life! (grunts) (breathing heavily) What happened? - You okay? - Where did they go? - I don't know. You better get out of here! - Oh! Sorry. - Excuse me. (sirens wailing distantly) - I'm gonna need a drink for this. - Get the names, the address and phone numbers and make sure that they sign the statement before they leave, got it? Rookie. - Nah, I drink with the guy, he's alright. - No blood. - No bodies. (camera flashes) - Just this credit card. - A cigar. (inhales) - Cuban. - Doesn't make any sense. - They just disappeared. Will you cut it out? That goes for you too! Alright, come on, we gotta frisk you. - Oh! (upbeat funky music) - Police have no clue explain the disappearance of two lawyers but it is an episode reported earlier, - Hey! That was Bob's lawyer and the Moriarty lawyer. What's going on? (dramatic music) (phone beeps) (phone ringing) - Hello? It's for you. - Hello? It's for you. - Hello? - Someone's gotten to Longstreet. I wanna know who. - Yes, sir, right away. - I have top level attorneys coming in from all over the country and I want some answer now. (phone beeps) (scoffs) - How did he know where I was? How did he know this number? (footsteps) - Hey Bob, what's up? - Working on some stuff. - Quantum physics., ah well, that stuff. - I have energy applied to substance, something the vibration level-- - Are you okay, Bob? - It's called, breaking the electrical magnetic charge, was the inotropic effect of de-materialization. - Bob, - Yeah? - are you okay? Look, I mean, losing the case, the whole, way things happened. The ridiculous word, I mean, you gotta, you gotta give yourself a break! - Okay, no, not yet, you don't understand, uh, something happened, I don't know what it is and I'm not even sure if it did happen. (exclaims in surprise) (electric surging) Dammit, Kate! Can you please keep that thing in your bag? - Colleges, the law is the basis of our American society. It is the best legal system in the world. Now, we must evolve to the next level, we must become a nation not only governed by laws, but by lawyers. (chair squeaks) - Mr. M, how stands the senate? - The majority are lawyers, the senate will be with us on the crucial issues. - Mr. N? - You've had an unexplained disappearance in your firm recently, I believe he was uh, recruiting state legislators. - That wont effect our plans at all. - We must be very careful - Are you in? - Labors covered, all systems go. - Mr. E, as representative of our nations largest consumer advocate group and some of our most profitable litigation, how do you stand? - Everything's in place. - Excellent. Mr. Y? - The business lawyers are in. (inaudible talking) - Ms. R, the White House? - There is a limit to how much I can expose to you. - Well, ma'am, I think we could use a little bit of assurance. - Sir, I wouldn't be here without the knowledge of my, um, boss. - I think that's about all the reasonable assurance that we can expect. Now, Mr. X? Your decision, please. - As the representative of the FBI, I am a little leery of you having the drug cartel legal representative here, this part bothers me. - The legal system drains off huge profits from this enterprise. Would you rather that money stay in the hands of the drug lords? - Some people think there are too many law suites. (scoffs) - Now, don't be inane Mr X, lawyers don't sue people, people sue people. (all laughs) - I hear that! - I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline participation. - Mr. X, did you enter this meeting armed? (dramatic music) - Guilty as charged. - And I noticed that your right hand suite pocket sagged a bit, pocket tap recorder perhaps? - You're very observant. I have decided this meeting should be in the public form. I'm out of here. (electricity surges) - Damn! (electricity surges) (exclaims in pain) Somebody help her up. - [Ms. R] What the? - If there are no further questions, (chuckles) Sorry, just my little joke. This meeting is over. - I didn't know there was gonna be a drug guy here! Did you know he had a tap recorder? Do you know what this could do to my political career? - Well, thought the meeting went very well. - Well? Jesus a man died and we almost lost the attorney general! - If you're gonna play, play to win. - I want to concentrate all our efforts on the disappearance of Longstreet. Go get me that file. - Oh, yeah, I'll go get it. - May I have a word, sir? - Yes. - That murder trial last year, I got the man accursed of being a serial rapist off free. - Oh yes, excellent publicity for the firm. - Well he's just been charged with raping two more women and I'm due to defend him again. - Congratulations, this is a golden opportunity. A gift, careers are made on cases like this. The American people don't understand how hard we work, the price that we pay for our success. How they make their lousy little lawyer jokes, they belittle us while we keep them free. Good trial attorney doesn't just sell his brains, energy and expertise. He sells his clients soul and now, we're about to move this magnificent system closer to perfection and some day, they will thank us. - Yes, sir, I'm sure they will. - Don't touch the bowl, go away. - Hey, doc! How you been? Want a beer? - Uh, no thanks, Gus. - Here, have a beer! Sit down and relax, watch the game. So what kind of doctor are you? - I work in ER. - You knew that, dad. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ER doc, huh? So what's that, it means you do everything? Ah, hit 'em! - Actually it's become a specialty of it's own. - Did he see that? So, you do surgery? - Um, minor surgery and if anything big and I have to call in a surgeon. - Oh so, you just decide what specialist to call, eh? - Well, there's a little bit more to it than that. - Ah, I don't believe this! I remember when I was a kid, something went wrong, you went to the family doctor and was taken care of. Eh, you see this? - Chips? - You made the papers. Emergency room physician, Robert Lee, was found to be negligent in the care-- - Dad, dad,dad, we don't need to hear that right now. - The sum awarded is one of the highest in the areas history. Doctor Lee was said to settled the cases out of court, he says to avoid the aggravation of a trial. He's now at risk of losing his license, furthermore, what, what, what, what? Hey, doc we know you're a good doctor. You know, let's us go bowling together one of these nights. (bongo music) (doorbell rings) - Yes? - Mr. Lee? I need to speak with you. - Do I know you? - I was serving you at the bar the other night, remember? May I come in? (scoffs) Doctor Lee, I really need you to help me. - What do you want? - I saw what happened the other night. - I'm not sure what happened myself. - Well, I didn't see it all but, one minute you guys were talking and the next minute there was this flash of light and you made a really strange noise. - That's pretty much all I remember. - Oh! Wait a minute, there I am. - And you say you don't recall anyone else with the two lawyers? - Right. - Uh, thank you. The police are refusing to make any statements- - My memory can get better. - Refusing to say if these events are related to the similar biker disappearance reported earlier. - Look, I don't know what you're trying to do here but I'm not a rich man, in fact I'm completely broke and I don't feel like living my life in a blackmail. - Wait! You don't understand. I'm divorced, my ex-husband owes me child support. - Well I'm not an enforcer of delinquent husbands either. - Will you shut up and listen? He's not the problem, his lawyer. He wont give me a cent unless his lawyer tells him to and his lawyer wont do that unless I, entertain him. I'm sick of it, I can't do it anyway, please! Doctor Lee, you have to help me. - Why don't you go to the police or how about the bar association? - Other lawyers? Ha! Don't make me laugh. - I'm not your man. - Sorry, but you are. I saw your eyes after those guys disappeared, you may not be much on ex-husbands, but you're real rough on lawyers. - What are you saying? - Look, I don't care how you do it, but I want that lawyer out of my pants. - Here. - Get out with that thing! - It's a safe gun-- - I'm sure it is. - A drug dealer lost it in the bar. His name is Pendalton, he's with the Moriarty firm. - Another MF lawyer. - Here's his address, catch him at home, spook him and my memory stays bad about who was with those guys when they disappeared. Understand? - Um, look, I don't threaten people. - I'm not gonna change my story, but I really need your help. - You say this guy works for Moriarty? Okay, I'll talk to your guy. Not to threaten, just try to reason with him. - You're so good to me. (muffled talking) - Kate! - Bob! - Kate! - Bob. - Kate, you're home early, how was class? - You wanna tell me what's going on? - Um, oh, I would like you to met Miss, um? - Anna. - Anna, Miss Anna! - Carol. - Carol Anna. - Anna Carol. - That's what I meant. (chuckles) - Oh, look at this, I better help you get out of here. Now, remember what I said, stay off your feet there and take care of that gallbladder. Be very care, Kate? Kate! (door closes) - I better go. - I don't get this, she came into the ER a year ago and she just shows up now. Why? - I don't, she just wanted to thank me. - Thank you? Thank you for what, Bob? (scoffs) - Dammit Kate, I'm a doctor not a mind reader. Look, it's just something she felt she had to do, but she did give me something. - Oh and I don't give you what you need? - No, kate, it's nothing like that. She gave me Moriarty. - Moriarty? She gave you Moriarty? - No, a connection to Moriarty. It's gotta be him, I mean, everything goes back to him. Look, the Moriarty lawyer prosecuted me, and MF lawyer hung me out to dry in my divorce. My own lawyer was going to join Moriarty and she's even in trouble with one. It's gotta be more than just coincidence and every last one of them is totally scum. I just gotta find out. - Are you gonna see her again? - Who? - Bob, the woman who just left our house. The one with the fake eyelashes and the press on nails and the push-up bra and the dress three sizes too small. - Fake eyelashes? - Oh, no. No, no, no. (relaxing ambient music) (doorbell rings) - Yes? - Ms. Pendalton? - Yes? - I'm very sorry to disturb you at this hour but I need to speak with your husband. - Oh, no, we normally don't entertain guests or clients this late, I'm sor-- - I understand, but I, it is very important. - Well alright then, you seem like a nice young man. Come in. - Thank you, ma'am. (water flowing) - Willy? - What is it? - This young man-- - You know I never see clients out here. - Yes, I know dear, but he said-- - Alright, alright. Since you're already here might as well give you the benefit of some free advice. Most people wanna be protected in a divorce, usually have one thing to value. At least above all the rest, the house, a car, boat, something they're afraid of losing so this is my advice. If you wanna get a divorce, buy two or higher me. Have a good evening. - Mutual acquaintance asked me to see you, a Miss Anna Carol. You represent her ex-husband? I think you know the story, she wants you to stop. - I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. If you don't disappear immediately I will have you arrested and proceed to tear you from limb from limb in both civil and criminal court, am I perfectly clear? - She just wants you to leave her alone. Look, she even gave me a gun. - Put that gun down. - I'm not going to use it, I just want to show you how desperate she is. - I said put that gun down now or we do not talk. - Now, I wanna know, who is Moriarty, and why does he wanna try and ruin my life? - You are no longer just a irritation, you are a problem. - Just a minute young man. - Ah, Martha, just in time. I'll call the police. - No, no, no. Don't touch the phone. You know, Willy, it's been a long, long marriage. I heard what the young man had to say, I don't think a day has gone by that I haven't thought how nice it would be if you had a clean, quick fatal heart attack or even a stroke. When you passed your treadmill test with flying colors, (laughs) my heart sank. I've known about your affairs for years, you don't just like to cheat on me, you like to hurt women, don't you? Mentally, I've hurt fully. - Oh, no, Martha Snookums, it's all a pack of lies. - I was it were, I suppose divorce was always an option, but then who knows how to make a divorce more painful and more vicious than you? (both chuckles) No one, young man? I want you to shoot him. - What? - Take the gun and shoot him. - Martha, stop this silliness right now. - Shoot him, now. - Martha. (cocks gun) (dramatic music) - No, I'm not shooting anybody. Not even him. - Well, give it to me. - You stupid old bat! You don't know-- (gun fires) (gagging) (gun fires) - He's dead. - Whose gun is this? - Belongs to a drug dealer I'm told. - Ah, perfect, young man, come here. I want you to put your hands on the handle and the trigger. I want your pints on it. (scoffs) - No, ma'am. I didn't kill your husband, I'm not gonna put my prints on there. You can wipe them off if you want, but I didn't shoot anybody. - Now, go on. (humming) (sirens wailing distantly) - Gee, this would have killed him any who. - Probably. - Pendalton, is he that fancy divorce lawyer? - Nah, nah he was a slimy lowlife who lied and cheated and steals from hardworking husbands, whose wives spend it on their lousy, stinking long hair, tattooed boyfriends! - Hey, Glase, you're a pro, huh? - Okay! - Settle down. - Alright, - You alright? - I'm okay. - Alright, I'm lettin' you go. - Alright, okay. (exhales heavily) - That was Alice's lawyer right? (laughs) - Told you to never mention her name to me again, you son of a bitch! - Jesus, come on, he's already dead! (thumping) - Bob, we gotta talk. - Go ahead. - I can't talk to you when you're bouncing up and down like that. - I can hear you. - Just look at this. - My God, where did you get this? - I thought you'd be interested. - Kate, there's nothing in his file. - Who is this guy? - He doesn't exist. - I gotta go. - Bob, you can't leave like this. - Kate, I can't get into this right now. - Bob, you can't go to the hospital like that! - Please, I'm not dealing with my anger very well these days. - Robert! You're pants. - More on the case of the disappearing lawyers, this is the second Moriarty lawyer in the news this week. First, James Longstreet disappeared and now, well known divorce attorney, William Pendalton of the Moriarty firm was found shot to death. You can take it from this reporter, we have not seen the last of this case. - I don't believe this, what's going on? - Channel five action news will be there to give you all the details. - I want you to talk to all the clients involved with Longstreet and Pendalton. - Yes, sir, right away. - Someone is after us, I wanna know who and I wanna know now. - We've changed that number three times, no one knows that number. I don't know that number, you don't know that number, no one knows that number! How does he know that number? - [TV announcer] The 450 million dollar Moriarty building, is the symbol of this mysterious billionaires wealth and power. It is the largest privately owned building in the world. Police are still trying to connect the disappearance of the two lawyers to the bikers disappearance earlier. Now this, (doorbell rings) (yells) - I'm looking for Doctor Lee. - Who are you? - Police, just some routine questions. - Let me see your credentials. What's this all about, detective Wong? - Just some routine questions. - Ah, well Doctor Lee isn't in, so if you wanna leave your number I'll have him call you. - Could you do that for me? Call me any time, day or night. (door slams) (banging) (sirens wailing) - Is your child having difficulty in school? Involved in drugs? Call the Moriarty firm for a free consultation. Nine times out of 10 we find that your child's problems are not your fault, but rather due to medical negligence at the time of delivery. (door slams) - Bob! What did you do with Moriarty? - Uh, left it at the hospital, why? - Some creep came by last night and he said he was from the police department, but he had brief case and it had the initials MF on it. He gave me this business card. - [Man on TV] If you call now, the Moriarty repressed memory experts, will help you determine your problem-- (static surges) if you call now, the Moriarty law firm repressed memory experts, will help you determine your problems Is your child having difficulty in school? Involved in drugs? In drugs? Call the Moriarty firm. Hundred, five, five, five, seven, three, child having difficulty in school? Involved in drugs? (explosion) (screams) - Call your father, get him over here. Don't leave the house! - Bob! Bob! (jazz music) - Someone is threatening our plans, we must find out who it is. Perhaps it's a member of the committee? What if we eliminate one member at random, frighten the rest? - Oh, sir. - Yes? - Oh, nothing. - No, go on. - Well, if you make one of the members disappear, wont the others see you as disloyal? - To what are we loyal? - We're loyal to our clients. - To what are we loyal? - We're loyal to each other. - To what are we loyal? We are loyal to the money and our clients must learn to trust that loyalty. We'll work out of the command center from now on. - Command center? - It's in the basement, lead shielded in a electrified vault. The CIA couldn't wire tap a monitor in this place. - What's the point? - Security and surveillance. - Surveillance? - Incredible surveillance. - Oh, God. (inaudible talking) (phone rings) - ER. - Mary, do you know where Bob could have gone? - Who is this? - It's Kate! - Honey, I don't know where he is, this is his day off. - Oh, God. - They don't really seem as bad as you say. - Trust me, you just don't know them yet, they are horrible-- - The meeting has already started, why was I told the wrong time? - It's on the brochure. - I was told the wrong time, that is why I'm late. - [Man on intercom] Today's Moriarty seminar's, now in room 101. The frivolous lawsuit, room 201. Acting for lawyers, (snickering) - Well that one was kind of snotty. - At least you know where you stand with that one, it's his polite ones that scare me the most. - There is no jeopardy to our plans, as long as we discover the source. - What's all this for? - I designed all this myself, I like to watch what goes on at the office. These computers contain complete files on our attorney's, their clients. Opposing attorney's and their clients. Their families, their children, their personalities. Income, credit rating, marital status, marital infidelities. (chuckles) You and Rose-- - Uh, sir, look, I try to keep it out of the office, but he's like the nicest-- - Use the computers to look for any obvious connection between Longstreet, Sumner and Pendalton. I'll review the video taps. - [Man on intercom] Today's Moriarty law seminars, now in room 101 the frivolous lawsuit Room 201, acting for lawyers. - Where's Moriarty? - Um, maybe he's down the hall? (dramatic music) - That one was really scary. - [Man on Intercom] You learn the law in law school, now the Moriarty firm teach you how to become a real lawyer, a Moriarty lawyer. Moriarty law seminars now in session. Be prompt, Moriarty law-- (explosion) - Which seems to go bad in about 12 years, cause that is as good as anyone can do, but we sue the company anyway. They are going to quit making their particular plastic palamer. So no more heart valves, what do we do? The heart valves are mated, the more people will die. - No, don't give us your civilian ethics. Young man, this is a Moriarty law firm course. - Well, maybe we need to back off on the lawsuits for a while, I mean, nobody can sue them if they're out of business. - Right! That is how you define greed, when you milk the cow so hard it could kill it. (electricity surging) - As a professional psychologist, I urge you to recognize that spouses are frustrated and insecure. Divorce is as traumatic as death of a loved one for most people. Now, for the Doe's. Give good advice and create a team of two lawyers working together to help two people suffering through the paint of divorce. Don't use the children as weapons, (electricity surging) A developing child, when pitted against a, - Your client has just killed his parents with a pitchfork, are you going to use the standard use defense? The jury must not only feel your clients pain, they must also feel you feeling your clients pain! Gestures must be large, not too effusive, be in the moment! (electricity surging) (explosion) - Moriarty! I'm going to get you! (wind blowing) (alarm wailing) - What the hell was that? - Power surge? - That was the Devil. - Excuse me? - Oh, present company excluded, sir. - No, something very powerful nearly got to us and killed us - A laser? - No, something else. - A big laser? - No, something very powerful and intermittent, probably working on a subatomic level. Something so far beyond your, our science as we know it. If it weren't for the 100 thousand volts that encases this vault, we'd all be dead. - Don't let me get in your way. Get me the police. - Reports continue to come in from all over Chicago. We now take you live downtown to the Moriarty firm, where Tonya O'Neal is standing by. - George, all of the lawyers here have disappeared. The police are not saying anything, there are no official statements. It's of note, that absolutely no none lawyers have disappeared. Receptionist, secretaries and even paralegals all unharmed. These random disappearances of lawyers seemed to be connected, but how is not exactly clear. - Keep checking these tapes. The answer is in there somewhere. - [TV Woman] But at this time we are unable to get through. (laughing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Who is this? - It's for you. - Well, I am at my grandmothers. That was my aunt. - Well give granny and auntie a big kiss from me and get your ass over here, now. - Gotta go. - [Both] No, no! - No, no, no, I really gotta go. (laughing) - My, my, my. - How could something like this happen? - I don't know how he could've gotten in here, I run this place like a fortress. - This is Tonya O'Neal-- - I got video cameras everywhere! - reporting live from the Moriarty building. (exhales) - How many disappeared? - 104, mostly Moriarty lawyer trainees, some junior partners, five lawyer speakers and one acting coach. - What about the woman still here? - I've had people fall asleep during lectures before, but never disappear. - I got the lowdown from one of the secretaries, you know the ones who disappeared? She refers to them as dishonest bastards. - What are you telling me, some kind of scum-ball detector comes through and he evaporates everyone? - We pulled in everyone we can. - FBI? - Two forensics teams coming in today on a charter, while the evidence is fresh and a bigger investigation team coming in in the morning. - What evidence? Look I need all the help I can get. - I've got him on the phone now lieutenant. - Who? - Moriarty. - Oh, Moriarty, okay. Uh, Mr. Moriarty, I got some bad news for you, all the participants in your seminar have disappeared. - The good news is the secretaries are still alive. - Will you cut it out with the secretaries already? Oh, no, no, not you, sir, no. - Oh my God, this is hard to believe. Yes, I understand, of course, of course and yes lieutenant, just as soon as I can. Thank you very much, but no you have, you have the really hard job. Thank you, yes, thank you, thank you, goodbye. (phone beeps) Entire lawyer trainee class disappeared. - That's impossible. - How? - Not known, but I'll bet you anything it has something to do with that force that we felt down here. - Kate? - Mary! Thank God you're here - Oh, listen, thought I'd better drop by you sounded desperate. What's going on? - Mary, I don't know where to start. - Doctor, Moriarty, (electricity surging) Kate! (laughs) I did it, I did it! (laughs) Oh, baby I got 'em! I got 'em all! (electricity surging) Oh God! Mary, what are you doing here? - What in the, I was afraid of something like this! What have those lawyers done to him? - Oh Mary, I don't think it was just the lawyers. - Any obvious correlations? - Not here. - Me neither, everything looks like a long shot. - Go to high speed scan. - Oh, um, I'm um, I didn't take typing, sir so I'm, Oh. (funky music) Dammit, John! You said I was the only one. - But, you are the only, oh. Uh, I lied. - Will you two knock it off please we, oh, Lisa. - Isn't that my dress? - [Both] Not anymore. - Excuse me, ladies, would you happen to know where a Doctor Robert Lee lives in the neighborhood, do you? - [Both] oh, you can head towards that way. Oh, no you're right, it's there. - No! you know what, - It's the third house, - Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, you're very, very kind, yeah thanks. - Stop it right there, that's him, when was this taken? - Just before our seminar lawyers disappeared. - Wasn't he the defendant in the Longstreet case? Uh, what's his name? - Lee, - Lee! - Robert Lee, he was the defendant in the Longstreet case, sir those were the first two to disappear. - That's our man, what ever power he possesses is incredibly advanced. Seems that we're going to have to get Doctor Lee, before he gets us. - Uh, Sir, shouldn't we call the police and the FBI? - Oh, please. I'm the only person on this planet who knows what that device can really do. You realize how they view us don't you? - Who, sir? - The police, the FBI. - They don't like us. (laughs) - No, they hate us. We're going to have to do this one on our own. Scarface will get us guns. - Guns? You mean you want us to take them on ourselves? - Why are we the wealthiest law firm in history? - Uh, oh we are the best and the brightest. (exhales) Freemont, what was your law school graduating rank? - Uh, third from the bottom, I'm afraid. - We've got street smarts? - Why are we number one? - We bust out ass, we come early, we stay late, we over charge? - Any fool can do that. We are number one because we scare the hell out of people and that's exactly what our clients want us to do. They know that we'll use any trick, any scheme to win and if they jerk us around they know they'll get it back 10 times over. That's why we're number one and now some jerk, some guy out there, with this weird power is trying to take all that away from us! Well we are not going to let that happen, are we? - No, we are not, sir. - Are we? - [Both] No, no! - Are we? Are we? Are we? - [Both] No, no, no! - [All} No, no, no, no, no! - Let's get him! - [Both] Yeah! - Reports of the disappearance of lawyers all over the United States continue to pour in. Reports are coming from New York, Washington, Miami, Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis and hundreds of small towns. A case that was all ready-- - Kate, Kate! Get in here quick! - What, what? - The highest ranking official left in the administration is the secretary of health, she will be speaking soon as, oh, one second. This just in, this is from our affiliate in Los Angeles. They are reporting the disappearance of all lawyers. (laughing) In all my five years of reporting, I have never experienced anything like this. - Bobby look, I don't know what's going on here, but, (whistles) I'm a little scared. (screaming back and forth) (grunts) - Thank you. See? All better. - What the? You again! - Oh, look! (stealthy music) (muttering) - Ah, yeah. Ha, ha! - So this anger device is the cause? - Well the anger amplification device takes, well all the negative emotions that we all feel from, anger, hostility, anything negative and amplifies it and then channels it through a single individual. Makes him tremendously powerful. - Thousands of lawyers have disappeared, Bob, some of our best friends are lawyers. - [Both] Were lawyers. (stealthy music) (grunts) - Oh, there is a glimmer of hope for your friend, Bob, Bob is it? - Yeah, what? - Uh, it's just that we designed the AAD to generate total and complete forgetfulness in our enemies. - Yeah, but does that work for our species? - Boy, I don't know. I mean, I, well there are some brains similarities, but I, I really am not sure. Oh, did I mention that your house is surrounded by angry lawyers and they're fully armed. - Can you kill 'em? Paralyze 'em! - Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't do anything like that, not at all. - What? Well what can you do? You're the one that got us into this mess! - Well, I can apologize for having created any inconvenience for you and then I can just say Adios! (yells) Sorry, just a little alien humor. (laughing) (stealthy music) - Oh! - There was something things I could have asked him. All the questions of the universe. - Yeah, I didn't get a name - I didn't get a picture. - I didn't get that hair, you know? - Yeah, that was kinda weird. - Yeah, yeah the hair. Oh well, I finally feel better. - How can you feel better? We're surrounded by a gang of angry lawyers with guns! - Because now, I finally know what's going on! (gun fires) - I think I heard something. - Ah! The phone is dead. - Oh, I see one going to the back! - No, get away from the window! - Should we make run for it? - I don't think we'd make it, look, kill the lights, lock the doors, I'll try to find something to use as a weapon. - [Both] Okay! - Oh and Kate, Mary, be careful. They're armed and they're dangerous. - Well, hell, they'll try anything! They're lawyers, aren't they? - Oh, Bob! Bob, it's gone! - Come on! - Just when I really needed it. - Did anyone escape from the house? - They're still in there, I saw somebody before the lights went out. - I may have hit someone. - Excellent. Let's go. (upbeat funky music) (cocks gun) - Oh, thank you. What? I don't know what that means, just tell me! - You have to be, - Just tell me, just tell me! - Quiet! Entirely too much noise, now, I'm going out and walk the perimeter. You check around here, listen carefully. Make sure no one attempts to escape by jumping from the second floor. - Affirmative. - Alright. (clanking) (gun fires) - Ow! Stop shooting, you idiot it's me! - Freemont, is that you? - Yes! You shot me in the leg! - Oh, let me help. - Yeah, you better help me, look at this thing, Ow! Stop that! - What's going on here? - I'm shot! This asshole shot me in the leg! - Is that it? - Ow! - It's barely bleeding. - I'm shot! - Get up on your feet! - It hurts like hell! - Get up on your feet, we need you! Come on! - I'm down, I tell you! - You wimp! - You're with me now, aren't you? - Well shouldn't - Aren't you? - I clean the blood up - Aren't you? - I don't want to - Aren't you? - leave a mess - Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? - Well, alright, - Yes, yes, yes - Yes, yes, yes - [Both] Yes! - Good, you go first. (cocks gun) I'll cover you. (grunts) (thumping) - Good weapon! - Get behind me! - Wait, wait, wait! - Wait a second, wait a second, what is your average? - 110? - Exactly. (rumbling) - Yes! - Hide! - Well, since you're using bowling balls to defend yourselves. I assume that you have no guns and that the AAD is inactive. You have 10 seconds to hand it over, Doctor. Otherwise, I'm going to kill you. - it's not here, I don't have it. - You're wasting our time, Doctor, I want it now. - It's gone, It's probably light-years away from here. - Where are the others, Doctor? (scoffs) Perhaps they're in the closet? (cocks gun) Oh, it was already loaded. - Moriarty, it's over. - You fool, you think that you can destroy me? You've only set my plans back, you are a minor obstacle, that I'm about to remove permanently. - Wait! Before you do, I just have to say on thing, I love you. - Do you expect me to fall for that? Ow! - Got the gun! Alright, help me tie him up, Kate! Alright, now Mary, - Yeah? - Go use the car phone and call for help. - Okay. - Hey! - Ow! - Who are you? - I'm shot! - So where's your gun? - Right here. - Let me take a look at that, what are you supposed to be anyway? - Ah, that's nothing, honey! - Ow! - You know what a 12 gauge would do to you? Don't move. (phone beeping) - Put it down. Now we are going to walk very slowly into the house and see what's going on. - Neighborhood watch, you asshole. - Doctor, doctor will I live? - I'm not a doctor. - What a cannon, reminds me of Desert Storm. - Yeah, the good old days. - Oh, hey guys, I need a stretcher here. - What are you talking about, moron? It's just a scratch, your partner has a concussion. - Excuse me, former partner. Now I wanna make a deal and I wanna go out of here on a stretcher. Any of the networks here yet? - Who is that guy? - I don't know, some jumoke with a French hat. - Uh, excuse me, flat foot, it's call a beret. - Are we rolling guys? Excuse me, excuse me, so you're saying you were shot by one of the perpetrators? - Uh, yes, I was shot by one of my former partners as I attempted to stop this break in. I also have extensive documentation of a major conspiracy that will shock the nation. - No, lieutenant, lieutenant, please, just a moment, lieutenant, of your time. Just a moment, sir, please? What I want to explain is, that I am Americas last best hope. I was about to move this great American system of ours closer to perfection. The American people are children and they need me. - [Radio] Unit 72, what is your 20? - Wait right here. - Yes. - You wont move? - No. - [Radio] Unit seven, two, what is your 20? - I believe in the law, lieutenant. - [Woman over radio] Mike, where'd you go? - Unit 72. - [Radio] Mike, we just had a couple of weird calls from Washington. FBI, CIA, they say they've got forensic teams scheduled to fly in to investigate but no one knows what it's all about. - Ah! (electricity surges) (funky music) - [Radio] Thought you might know something about this. - That's strange, I vaguely recall something about it, training seminar, better cancel till we get more information, 10-4. - Hey, where's the guy? - What guy? - The guy who was with you. - What, who? - Got a light? - Who are the Cubs playing this weekend? - I hate the Cubs. - Uh, you don't happen to have your handcuff keys on you, do you? - Oh Mary, you should have seen, I nailed him - I saw that. - I meant what I said. - Oh, yeah, well then, say it again. - Come on, McGus, let me give you a ride. I think they want to be alone. - What? Somebody's gotta be holding a gun to your head? - Hey! That's my little daughter. (laughs) - I know, Gus.
