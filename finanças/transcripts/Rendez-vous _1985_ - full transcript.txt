Train 52, arriving from Toulouse, Montauban, Cahors, Brives, Limoges, and Chateauroux, is now entering the station. This is Paris-Austerlitz. All passengers please detrain. ...enterprising spirit. Go with the flow. This will help you succeed on the material plane. You long to increase the scope and intensity of your actions. Do it! Study, and use your imagination! Aquarius, your instincts are good. You're inclined to all kinds of study and creative work. A waste of another two hours! People are insane! Take Baby for me. They describe the place like it's a palace. You go all the way across Paris, and when you get there, it's a dump. Did you get pictures? Yes. They call it "Old Style." Don't make me laugh! A place like that is more than old. It's a ruin. Here. Sure, it's big. But who in their right mind would ever live there? I didn't beat around the bush. I told them, "If you don't fix it up, you'll get peanuts for it." Max? Yes, ma'am? - Did you type that contract for Mr. Reinhard? - Yes. How do you spell that? Like it's pronounced. How do you pronounce it, then? Renard. That's what I thought. Right, Paulot? You did say Renard? It's not Renard. It's Reinhard. Type it all over again! No, don't. Let me sit down. I'll do it myself. That way I'll know it's done right for once. Make yourself useful. Get us some coffee. I swear! Hello. Paulot, a customer. I'm looking for an apartment. Step this way. I'll see what I can do. Sit down. - Just what are you looking for? - A place that's all mine. I'm sick of crashing at friends' places, and hotels are depressing. - You have to be more precise. - In what way? - What part of town? - I don't know Paris. Soissons Real Estate. I don't care, as long as it's near the center. - Furnished or not? - Unfurnished. How big? I don't know. Depends on what you've got. And how much are you looking to pay? Not too much. As cheap as possible. - Still, I'd like something nice. - You have some financial guarantees? I'm an actress. I can earn 200 francs a night. I see. That's wonderful! I don't get top billing yet, but that'll come. I only have one scene, but I give the name of the play: Tea or Chocolate. Have you seen it? Tea or Chocolate? No. I've got a ticket with me. Here. Gertrude Soissons Real Estate. 11:30! I have an audition. Anything more you need to know? No, that's all for now. Well, good-bye. Yes, call me back. Really, Hector! Girls don't just blow away in the wind. Did you search the whole house? She can't be far away. The car's still in the garage. Rosalie. Did Madame ring? Tell me, Rosalie. Have you seen Mademoiselle this morning? Mademoiselle? Yes, Mademoiselle! My daughter Veronique! No, I haven't seen anybody. Madame and monsieur are the first people I've seen today. Did you sleep well? Not really. Tea or chocolate? Coffee, Rosalie. Today we'll have coffee. May I have a cup of tea? It's a mystery! There are too many mysteries around this house. Everyone acts so mysterious! Veronique ran away from home. Nothing mysterious about that. For God's sake! - You dare say such a thing? - Yes, I dare! Veronique lacks for nothing here. She's blossoming. She's radiant and full of joy. Wait. I still have my makeup on. Nice of you to come. I wanted to say thanks for the ticket. Come in. I saw your scene. It was really- You have a lot of presence. You think so? Fred. My name is Paulot. My name's Anne Larrieu. But everyone calls me Nina. This radio's a piece of junk. Now I got it. I saw you in the play too, didn't I? Not in the play. I was an usher. What are you doing tonight, Paulot? Me? Tonight? - Nothing. - Why not come with us? Will you get the wine, Fred? All I could find for the moment is this. Let me see. It's in terrible condition, but it's dirt-cheap at least. Can't ask for everything. We're out of wine. We'll have to drink water. I found another poster today. Look. - What are those pictures? - Nothing. He may have found me an apartment. What for? - You unhappy here? - No, it's just not mine. - Isn't it good enough for you? - I didn't say that. - I just want a place of my own. - What for? To fuck anybody you want? You already do that here. That won't change anything. This looks delicious. What's the matter? Ashamed in front of him? Up yours, Fred. Shall I tell him how you picked me up? And all the others? Don't worry. She'll get over it. That's it. Go ahead. Pack up your things. Don't forget anything! Because if you split on me now, you'll never set foot in here again. Look at her. Three months in Paris. Three months. Screws anyone, anywhere. But she gets upset if you say it. Will you help me? If you're next, I wish you luck. Fuck her good, then throw her out. Some friendly advice. Beat it! I'm glad! Good riddance. I hope you drop dead! You hear? I hope you drop dead! What I liked about Fred was his one-track mind. His poster collection, his obstinate ways. You know? Obsessed with who knows what. There's always something to like about a man. Where are we going? If you've got nowhere else, come to my place. - Okay. - Only it's pretty far. The subway's stopped running, but we can grab a taxi. No, I prefer walking. I'm not at all sleepy. - You don't mind? - No, of course not. - It's not too heavy, is it? - No, it's fine. Do you often go around hurting guys that way? I don't get it. At first they're glad to jump into bed with me, but afterward they start insulting me. I'm used to it. I don't care anymore. So you've had lots of lovers then. I'll say! The nights I've slept alone since I came to Paris I could count on the fingers of one hand. So you like Paris? I love it. Especially at night. Do you often walk all night long this way? Sometimes I get lost, and I won'task people for help. It's big. Too big for one man. This is Quentin. The man who never sleeps. Sit down. - Coffee? - No, thanks. I'm dead tired. I'm gonna sleep right here. The light and the noise won't bother me. Just pretend I'm not here. I poured you a cup anyway. You can drink it later. She's gonna stay a few days till she finds a place. Poor girl doesn't know anybody else. Let her sleep under the bridge. Why are you being like this? I forbid you to put anyone up here. I never stopped you from bringing anyone home. Don't preach to me now. Nobody stays more than 24 hours. We agreed. A quickie, okay. But no live-ins. - It's not a quickie. - Then what is it? Honestly, you two. Can't you keep it down a bit? Can't you see someone's sleeping? Really, Quentin. You disappoint me. I hardly recognize you. I met him in London four years ago. He taught me my French. Stop it, Olympia. He's changed so much. Isn't it strange? Very strange. But stranger things happen. Wait. You can't just leave. Wait five minutes. Wait! It's right across the street. I think the Italian girl stays here too. Good morning. Do you have a room? - Are you alone? - Why? It's a different price for two. You've been very nice to me. Thanks. Now you can go back to your friend. Quentin's not really a friend. We only met a month ago. We wanted the same apartment. It was too expensive for either of us, so we decided to share the rent. Besides, I don't have any real friends. I'm sorry, Paulot. I wasn't listening. I'm dead tired. You've been in Paris three months? Where were you before that? The southwest of France. Near Toulouse. I couldn't wait to turn 18. I was counting the days. When the day finally came, I packed my bags and took the first train. The day I arrived at the Austerlitz station was the most wonderful day of my life. But why'd you come here? To be an actress, right? Not just that. To live my life. Well, I might as well sleep here. I want to be alone. It's suffocating in here. No, go away, Paulot. I'm tired. All that walking, and besides, I'm sick of cheap hotels, and sleeping with men - It's too much. Calm down. You're just on edge. It'll pass. You'll be fine. And I left my cigarettes in the lobby. Wait here. Who is it? Is that you, Paulot? Go away or I'll scream! What are you so afraid of? I'm not going to kill you. Wouldn't be hard, though. Nobody saw me come in, and if I work it right, nobody would see me leave either. You can yell all you like, but no one would hear over the storm. Besides, all the other rooms are empty during the day. What do you want? Really, Hector. Girls don't just blow away in the wind! Did you search the whole house? She can't be far away. The car is still in the garage. Rosalie. Did Madame ring? Rosalie, we were wondering. Have you seen Mademoiselle this morning? Mademoiselle? Yes, Mademoiselle! My daughter Veronique. I haven't seen anybody. Madame and Monsieur are the first people I've seen today. Did you sleep well? Not really. Tea or chocolate? Today we'll have coffee, Rosalie. May I have a cup of tea? Yes, call me back. You can't just walk out on me. We have to talk. Let's have dinner. I'm sick of being dragged through the mud and called a whore. I told the truth. I didn't sleep with anybody when we were living together. Yeah, but you've always got guys prowling around you. Because all I ever meet are pricks like you. Who are you calling a prick? Who do you think you are, huh? You small-town hick! I taught you what little you know about acting. You'll have a great time with that nerd you were with last night! Quiet, please! There's a play going on out there! Wash your dirty laundry at home! - So long, Fred. - Out of the way! Hector, our daughter's been kidnapped. I saw your big scene. Magnificent. "Did Madame ring?" "Tea or chocolate?" Bravo. Great theater. Did I ask your opinion? Now get out of here! Did you hear me? How's it feel to take that off every night and find there's nothing underneath? Nothing. That's what attracts me about you. You get me? If I'm hot for a woman, I don't need artifice. Kills the hard-on, in fact. Get out or I'll have you thrown out. Calm down. You have to look at things the way they are. I want you. Make up your mind - yes or no. If it's yes, you come with me. Say no, and you're rid of me. It's up to you. Yes or no? You think I'm joking, huh? Then say it. See if I'm faking. Say no! Say it! Look, cut out the act. Yes or no? Quick! You nearly said no. But you couldn't, right? You'd have done me a favor. You're crazy! What kind of a game is this? It's no game, believe me. - Where are you taking me? - Don't ask questions. I'm late. - Late for what? - Here we are. It's about time. Hurry up, Quentin. You'll be fine here. The scene takes place in Juliet's room. She's bored in her palace. Summer nights are long in Verona, and youth is so short. But what is Juliet doing? Juliet, my child! What are you doing in there? Let me be, Mother. I'm dreaming. But what is Juliet's dream? I'll dream on the balcony. Shall I leave her to her solitary dreams, or shall I shatter them for good? Am I the answer to her yearning? Or an unwelcome suitor? She is Juliet, so am I not Romeo? They say the most innocent virgins make the most lascivious bitches. I intend to find out! What are you doing here? I've come to wish you a pleasant night. - Sorry, Paulot. I'm very late. - Never mind. That's okay. - I had an audition. - Do you have many? Yeah, but I never get the part. Where is it? Right here, but it's a dump. You won't want it. Yes, I will. I even have my bags. I tell you, it's really disgusting. I still want it. There's no concierge or anyone around. And the other floors are empty. They're going to tear the building down soon. - I'll have something else by then. - Let me carry a bag. - What floor is it on? - The second. It's right here. Wait. Let me get the right key. I could never live here. - I find it old-fashioned and musty. - Not me. I think it's wonderful. Stop! It's so old. No, it's perfect for me. Sure you won't change your mind in a week? - You won't be scared living here? - Scared of what? I don't know. Well, if you're positive you want it, I'll help you fix it up. It really is a wreck. I can give you an old bed. I'll help you, okay? First time someone helped me without asking for anything. That means a lot. Well, you mean a lot to me too, Nina. I've never had my own place before. - Let's open the shutters. - Wait till we've seen the whole place. Look. It's much lighter in here. Ah, that's what I like. There are no trees out there. I hate nature. Go ahead. Keep going. What's wrong? Don't you want it? Of course you do, just like all the others. Well, make it fast. Since you're looking for payment, go on! Have a ball. Ah, you like it the other way. Okay, go on. Hurry up. Get it over with. Do it, damn it! Well, if it isn't Miss Larrieu. Always a pleasure to have you with us. You're very early today. I'd have preferred it if you'd stayed later last night. Oh, well. Come with me. After the play, Hector summons you for a curtain call. You answer, "Coming, sir," and you go out and take a bow. You act like a slab of wood. At least try to smile and say thank you. I don't really give a shit about your play. It's hurting my career more than helping. Ah, your career! Poor little twit. I'M WAITING OUTSIDE. COME QUICKLY! QUENTIN. Hector, girls don't just blow away in the wind! Did you search the whole house? She can't be far away. The car's still in the garage. Rosalie! Where the hell is she? Where can Rosalie be? You know she's always late. Ad-lib. Two disappearances in one day! Unbelievable! Rosalie. - Quentin, I'm afraid. - You're always afraid. - I wasn't afraid before. - Before what? Before you. What'll I do? I have no money, no job, no anything. Why did I do that? Now you're all mine. I hear music. Come on. Turn up the radio! Turkey, Yugoslavia, Morocco, Spain. What do you say? No one to look for us, no one to find us. We'd disappear for good. Want to run away with me? No, I don't. Why won't you run away with me? I'm through running. I want to go home. All right. Let's go. I have the feeling you've been following me since we met. I have been. I even know where you live. How will I pay my rent? Come work at the sex club like me. It's really easy, and the pay's good. I can't. I just can't. Of course, you wouldn't have your cute little maid's costume to hide behind. What you do in life, you might as well do on stage. What's the difference if I fuck you in public? Shut up. You'd finally be taking some risks. You'd put your own body on the line. That way you'd understand what it's all about. You'll see. It's a great business. I'll teach you. I'm sorry. What are you drinking? Let me buy you one. A beer, please. - No, I'll buy you one. - Okay. Not exactly talkative, are you? It's fine by me. I can't stand gabby girls. More talk means less action. Isn't that right? Thanks for walking me home. - Ask me up for a drink? - I've got nothing in the house. Don't lead me on. And I've had enough to drink. You know this guy? What are you after? Just shaking the hand of the first sucker who came along. Who do you think you are, you bastard? Get out of here! Why don't you fight back? Fight back! - Beat it! - You stay out of this! Take that. - You asshole! - Nobody talks that way to me! Can't you see what you've done, you bastard? See what you've done? Lean on me, Quentin. - Let me help you. - I said no! I don't want anyone's help. You understand? Say it. Promise you won't help me. I won't help you. Why are you so scared of me helping you? There's already someone trying to change my life, and one is plenty. Who? A maniac. Somebody I used to know. Calls me up every single day. To save me, so he says. The fool. He must have a reason to say it. Sure he has a reason. What is it? Tell me. Never. I'll never tell you. What are you doing here? What about you? I was just bringing some- Don't you think we better settle this with Nina? Settle what? You gonna weasel out of it? No, I'm not. Then come on. Go on. Sit down. What's going on? Are you crazy? I asked Paulot in. This way you don't have to lie to him. The three of us should work this out together. What do you say? Ever want to fuck Paulot? Stop. You're hurting me. Let go! How about you, Paulot? Don't you want her? Fuck off! No use getting all uptight. It'd be more friendly if everyone made it with everyone. Why won't you sleep with Paulot? Don't you like him? He could make you happy. He's a real one-woman man. Isn't that right, Paulot? You're the ideal pair, you two. You want me to fix up your other cheek the same way? No, Nina wouldn't like that. - That's enough, Quentin. - Am I bothering you? Okay, I'll leave. What are you doing with that guy? You fool! He's the worst thing that could happen to you. The thought of him fucking you is enough to make me puke! How long's this been going on? What do I care? You have to stop now! If you came to criticize me, go away. I'm not criticizing, Nina. I just want to warn you. He'll hurt you as much as he can. He loves to hurt people. It's the only thing he talks about. If you think you'll beat Quentin, you're kidding yourself. I'd like to speak to Paul Trabichet. Follow me. Paul, someone to see you. My name is Scrutzler. I'm a friend of Quentin's. I just got to Paris. I stopped by his place. They sent me here. We lived together, but- Could you give me his new address? I don't understand. I wrote him I was coming. We'd set up a very important meeting. Quentin... had an accident. Yesterday morning. He's dead. You must be a relative. A relative, no. I mean... yes. Yes and no. I'm really very sorry, but we had no idea who to call. There's no one to call. I'll take care of everything. Who is that man? I've heard his name before. Whenever he'd call, Quentin would run like the devil. I went by the agency, but you weren't there. I waited for you till nearly 8:00. You're all set. I got the lease. It's all filled out. I'll take care of the rent. You happy? Look. Hey, look. Tell me everything you know about Quentin. Quentin's gone. He doesn't exist. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm sure you know something. If Quentin wanted you to know, he'd have told you. There's nothing to be afraid of now. You're rid of him. You piss me off talking like that. What do you want to know? I think he was living with some girl. He caused an accident, and she was killed. What kind of accident? I don't know, and I don't want to know! I've had it! - May I ask who you are? - Leave me alone. Were you Quentin's friend? I don't know. He didn't want any friends. So he was running away from you too. What do you mean by that? It was an accident. He threw himself under a car. Does the word suicide frighten you? It was an accident. I saw it. You got some color back. To our meeting. Cheers. When I'm in Paris, I always stay at this hotel. The last time I saw Quentin, it was here, almost a year ago. - No word from him after that? - Oh, yes. Strange letters. I was sure it would end this way. We had this project together, but in spite of that, he- You can never save anybody. I'm going. Are you going to leave just like that? Did you know him a long time? We met in London four years ago. I was putting on Romeo and Juliet. I needed an actor for Romeo. The minute he auditioned, I knew. He was extraordinary in the role. "I dreamed my lady came and found me dead, and breathed such life with kisses on my lips that I revived -" Mr. Scrutzler. Forgive me, but I believe we had an appointment. So we did. I'll be right back. Flowers for young lovers. Flowers for young lovers. We had a very vague agreement. No contract was signed. The play's been announced, dates are set, and rehearsals are about to begin! Rehearsals with whom? Who's going to play Romeo? You insisted on a certain actor, and we accepted him sight unseen. That actor's out of the picture. There's no reason now to do the play. It makes no sense without him. Flowers for young lovers. - Thank God you're home. - What's the matter? - I'm scared. - Scared of what? - Myself. I don't know. - Go on in. - You don't mind? - No. I didn't notice the first time I came by, but it's really nice here. Think so? I did it all. Except for Quentin's nudes. It was an obsession with him. I'll be sad to leave here, but the rent's too much for me. - How about something to eat? - No, I'm not hungry. It'll do you good. All right. What will you do with Quentin's things? Burn them? No. Why? I'll keep a few things. This sweater was his. How does it look? Would you mind if I look in his room? No, go ahead. It's in there. Coming? Cut it out. Don't start again. I don't want to sleep with you. I'd really like it if we could live together. And watch you screwing other men? What do you take me for, Nina? I won't screw anybody. I give you my word. I love you, Paulot. You're the only person I love. I want to live with you, but not here. It's too expensive. Move into my place. We'll share the rent. We'll share everything. With you near me, I'd feel better. You've got to believe me. You've got to trust me. - Where are you going? - I'll sleep over there. "If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, my dreams presage some joyful news at hand. My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne, and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamed my lady came and found me dead- strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think! - and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadows are so rich in joy." "O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name, or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man." Take her. You won't find anybody better. Very nice, Miss Monteil. Thank you. She's perfect. No more of your excuses. We've got you now. She'd be perfect if she were the right age. Juliet is 14. It's right here in the text. - This is too much. - What do we do now? Go on auditioning? - Anne Larrieu? - That's me. Good morning. Shall I begin? Go ahead. "Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face. Else would a maiden blush be paint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form. Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "aye," and I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearest-" That'll be all. Thank you very much. I'll do the play if she's Juliet. Otherwise I'm not interested. We've wasted enough time on this. You're not being fair. She's over 14 too! She is over 14, and I am unfair. Sometimes you have to be. Besides, do you know any 14-year-old actresses? You're a real hypocrite! It took you a whole week to make up your mind. Not at all. I was convinced right away. But I had to persuade the others, and that was no small feat. - You weren't sure at all. - I was very sure. This is the first time I've had sea urchins. - How do you eat them? - With a spoon or your fingers. - And some lemon juice? - No, no lemon juice. What do you think of Juliet? Oh, she's perfect. And so is Romeo. But I don't believe in perfection. Doesn't interest me. I have no idea what to do with that damn play. It's not the best thing Shakespeare ever wrote. Come with me. I've got something to show you. I'm keeping nothing from my old production except this dress. It's Juliet's. - Why did you pick me? - I didn't. It was fate that brought us together. I came looking for Quentin, and I found you instead. Why not use the other Juliet? The other Juliet- She was killed in a car accident. Four years ago. Quentin was driving, wasn't he? Yes. They were 16 when they met. They discovered everything together. The theater, love, success. Too much success, too much love. You know... it's not easy when everything's handed to you all at once. You understand? Nothing more to want, nothing more to wait for. Nothing more to ask for. They realized it couldn't last. The only place they could go was down. So they decided to die together, but Quentin survived. I'm the guilty party in all this. I practically forced them to fall in love. I took advantage of their youth. Maybe it's best not to stir all this up and drop the play. Juliet could be my big chance. I won't give it up. I'd like to start work right away. - I've got great news. - I'm in a hurry. I got the part of my life. You were out all night. You've got no business living with me if that's how it is. You're out of your mind. It was for work. For work? I thought you never got anywhere in auditions. If you got a part, you must've done something for it. - You don't really believe I - - I don't believe anything. You do whatever you want anyway. "My only love sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me that I must love a loathed enemy." Prodigious... "Prodigious birth of love..." No use screaming. I won't let you go. So you're gonna play Juliet. The tea-or-chocolate wench wants to be a princess, eh? Alas, it's a story about love, an emotion you're incapable of feeling. You're too shallow to imagine it, too common to understand it. I know what love is about because I gave my all for it. I paid the price with my life. And so did she. The real Juliet. The only Juliet. With you, the play'll turn into a cheap bourgeois farce. Maybe that's what Scrutzler's after. You never know with him. You'll be booed, your name dragged through the mud, and it'll serve you right. You'll step over anybody to get your shabby little name up in lights. You exploit my death, and what's more, you use her. She sacrificed everything for an ideal you can't touch, and you wipe your filthy feet on it! I forbid you to take her place, you understand? I forbid you to sully a story that doesn't belong to you! "My only love sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me, that I must love a loathed enemy." This isn't working. This isn't working. I can't get it. I don't get this play at all. Why do they love each other? Why does she love him? You mustn't ask all these questions. They're beside the point. Why do they love each other? Why do people love each other? Because they're enemies. You're too sentimental. You've got to act love as if it were hate. I'll pick it up after the kiss, when she says, "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." You can't spend all Sunday on it. It's after 6:00. But I've got to work on it! I'm fed up. You gave me this part. I need time. It's your responsibility. It was just the birds knocking against their cage. You're spending your life in here. That's not good. You ought to go out, have fun, make love. With whom? I don't know. You said you lived with someone. Make love with Paulot? He's sweet, but that's not enough. Have you ever loved anyone? Quentin. You love him because you've lost him. Have you ever loved anyone? My daughter. And I lost her. It was my own fault. Your fault? She was Juliet. I've lost her, and there's nothing I can do. Shall we go? We have to forget all that. Let's go enjoy ourselves. Oh, it's you. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. You always go home the same way. That raincoat was Quentin's. Not only that. This was his too. You're being ridiculous. I don't give a damn. You want to sleep with Nina, don't you? That's none of your business. She's young and pretty, and you're old and ugly. It's disgusting! You think she prefers ignorant little creeps like you? I love her, and I'm ready to fight for her! And you'd easily win. But would that prove she loves you? You mustn't ever touch her! Is that clear? You needn't be afraid. That'll never happen. I'm not the one who's afraid. You are! You're a pathetic old man! Your position gives you power over her. Don't take advantage of it! I never did. I never slept with Nina. I love her like only a father can. Like what? A father? Did you say like a father? You're right to laugh. Paulot, come look. Is this how you see Juliet? - It's not the way I see you. - Why not? Why not? Ever since you got this part, Nina's disappeared. And I don't give a damn about Juliet! Yes, but it's tough going. I'm afraid I might not make it. Oh, I'm not too worried. You have plenty of aces up your sleeve. Will you listen to a scene? I want your opinion. My opinion? I couldn't care less whether you play Juliet or not! Look at me for once! Don't you see I'm packing my bags? What's the matter, Paulot? Don't, Paulot. Please. This little comedy has run its course. I'm leaving! What have I done? Nothing. Not a damn thing. I didn't sleep with anybody! I'm leaving you everything except the alarm clock. What's going on? Are you out of your mind? So now I'm the one out of my mind? You know I love you, Paulot. Nina, you want everyone to love you, but you're incapable of love yourself. Love's not something in some shitty play. It's life. But you can't see that. You can't see anything! You see? You're not frightened of me anymore. I once told you that when you became nothing- a speck of dust- we'd be together again. Well, the moment has come. You're all alone now. There's just you and me. Tell me you won't play Juliet. I won't play Juliet. You see? I can be tender. Why are you crying? I'm here. What are you doing here? I'm being interviewed on TV today. I read the article where Scrutzler mentioned you. I'm waiting for him now. - Fred. - Cool it, everybody. Move along. Break it up. I saw a play by Scrutzler four years ago. Same play, in fact. Can't accuse the guy of novelty. But he sure knows actors. The guy playing Romeo was wonderful. I showed you the poster at the house. You remember? - So you're getting married? - Yeah. Seems incredible. I never thought it would happen. But Daisy's the real thing. Naturally nothing's ready, as usual! That's France for you. - You got an apple, sweetheart? - Sure. Here. Daisy, this is Nina. I met her a couple years ago. Anne Larrieu? Is that you? Mr. Scrutzler just called. He's not coming. We're calling off the interview. I'm sorry. What? You make this actress come all this way and then you cancel? - Who cares about your Mr. - - Scrutzler. Right. It's her face they're coming to see. - He canceled, not me. - Wait a minute. Don't worry. Daisy'll fix it up. You still living with what's-his-name? The guy who rents apartments. He took off. I haven't seen him in a week. He was a real dim bulb. No, 8:00's impossible. Hold on. 10:00 is out too. Is noon all right for you? Good. We'll meet at the apartment at noon tomorrow. Very good. Good night. Nice work, Paulot. You're back on top of things. Since you moved to the hotel, you're your old self again. - It was crazy to live with that girl. - Don't mention her. I never told you before, but you had me worried for my business. She wasn't the girl for me anyway. It's a big world. I'll find someone else. You're wrong, Paulot. It's a very small world. Good night. - Good evening. - Well, well. Hello, Nina. Forgive me for running off, but my hairdresser won't wait. Paulot, remember to set the burglar alarm this time. You all right? Yeah. And you? You know, working hard. - What are you doing tonight? - Tonight? Nothing. Going back to the hotel. Isn't that place depressing? Less than your place was. Anyway, I found something interesting. A studio. 3,000 francs a month. Look. I've got pictures. Tell me what you think. Not bad, huh? You can't see a thing. How would you know? Don't burn up my apartment, okay? So you smoke now. You look tired. Fuck me, fuck me. Fuck me! How's Juliet coming? I thought you didn't want to talk about it. It doesn't matter anymore. Well, I'll see you. We can't just say good-bye like this. I mean, we could go have a drink. All right. If you'd like. You hardly ate a thing. I've been a bit of a wreck since you left. It's because you work too hard. No, it's not that. The play opens tomorrow night, but it's not that. It's after 3:00, and they're closing. Don't you think it's time you went home to bed? I'm not tired. Want to come for a walk with me, like that first night? The first night? That was a long time ago. You're awfully quiet. You haven't said a word. You wanted to walk, so that's what we did - all night long. I've just got time to take a shower before work. So... anyway... I've got my fingers crossed for you. I'd like you to be there tonight. I brought you two tickets. For tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. - Where is he? - In the bar. Watch me from out front. You won't see a thing back here. I see better with my eyes shut. - How will I know if it's going all right? - It will or it won't. - I can't breathe! - Take a deep breath. You're fine. It's stage fright. Calm down. Come on. Take a deep breath. Breathe in slowly. It's Quentin who's doing this. - He doesn't want me to play Juliet. - Quentin is gone! You're on your own! - I can feel him here. - Quentin is dead. He's here. He's stopping me from - I'm going to die. You won't die. You'll give this part all you've got I'm going to die. You'll give it all you've got. Or perhaps you'll lose your nerve. Either way, it has nothing to do with Quentin. There've been thousands of Juliets before you, and there'll be thousands more. Call it off if you want. It's your decision. It's up to you. I'm done here. Where are you going? Places for Act 1, Scene 1. I'm going back to London. What are you doing? I have a taxi waiting. I fulfilled my contract. You can't do this! Everything will be fine, madam. Now it can start. Would you mind turning up the heat? It's already on high. Shall I turn on the radio? No, no music. "Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains only a single seed. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." John 12:24, 25
