How much longer Throw out everyone inside Where shall i take this infant if you send me out when my husband's not home? Wait till he comes How long should I wait? Your husband wants to hog all my money I have no ill will against you. Please wait. I'll repay Boothayya: Not Possible Sir, will the mother and baby survive in this winter if they're thrown out like this? Let them die. It's good for the village if the poor die of hunger. Village won't be good if the poor die. It would get better if people who crave for money like bed bugs die. Have you brought court's order to take possession of my home? Boothayya: Shut your mouth. Did you bring the court's order when you came to me asking for loan? Didn't you beg like a dog? Now you talk about law? Hey Kenga, lock the house. I'll see who is going to stop me now. Who can stop you in this village Sir? I should slap myself with my sandals for taking loan from you. Let's go now. Let him carry this house and pots on his head. Boothayya: Hey leave that too. Go now. Devayya: Who has lived happily after taking loan from that Boothayya? His loan grows like the shadow after noon. Let it go. You live in the hut in my backyard. Let things happen as Manjunatha(god) wants it. Washer man: Devappa, what a man you are. You are like god in this village. Devayya: No one's god in this village. There are only two kinds. One is humans and the other, demons. Come now. Devayya: Auntie, please cook something for them too. Auntie: What's this Devappa? What will happen to us if you keep feeding all who come to you? Devayya: It's Manjunatha(god) who gives all this. Everything will happen as he wishes. Go now. One should smoke the weed. And forget everything in its ecstasy. ~ One should smoke the weed~ The body is a pipe filled with unquenchable desires. ~One should smoke the weed~ Light it with colours and drag on while you like it. ~ One should smoke the weed~ Hey a song should impress at least a monkey even if it's written by a poet. Listen to me; I'll sing it. Light the pipe on to burn the weed like Boothayya to ashes. Should break his back uniting everyone in the village. (Laughing) Did you understand what I said? How should you fools understand?You are all who sign with your thumbs. You think Obbattu(sweet) when I say Oggattu(Unity). Hey, you bunk in that Boothayya's house day and night like a limping bull in a gutter. Don't you feel ashamed? Hey, though Kaurava killed all his brothers, Shakuni was on his side. Why? To destroy Kaurava's family. Just like that, this Singalayya aka Bundekyata is dwelling in that house to weed his family out. Yes you will, only the weeds grown in his backyard. Hey Bundekyata, he has made enormous lands widening the split of the river Kaveri When she(the river) couldn't do anything what can you do? Just drag on this pipe. When time comes, you will know what this Singalayya aka Bundekyata is. Boothayya:How long will it take to make one stitch? It's over sir. Until now, I have made some 1000 stitches from toe to heel. I'm marking the places to make stitches for future repairs. Take them. Sir, Money? Boothayya: Money? Warm(Kaasu) your hands in fire. Whom are you asking the money from? You should pay me taxes for letting you use this place. Beware. (Spits) Leech. Worse than a vulture. Those creatures at least feed on the dead. This man sucks the life out of the living. Even though struck by paralysis twice, he survived without paying a penny to the doctor. If he gets one this time, he's into the grave for sure. You're are the only one left from my mother's side. You wouldn't come to see how sister and her children are living their lives? What to do? We have married you off to such a house. Mother It's Grandpa. Boothayya has opened this charity house for the villagers to come and have food. One should have shame. Sit down Brother Yes sit down. Your sister is asking, sit and enjoy the meal. Girija , give him a handful of butter and potful of milk. It's been three years since we have seen each other. That's why he came to see me. Yes. Relatives find all kinds of excuses to come and have a free meal. You should keep them miles away. Keep this in mind. What's this? The sambar is smelling pleasant? You are not getting it even after hundred times. The sambar will last for three days if you don't boil the grams. But will spoil the next day if you boil it. Did you understand? Sir Ayya. Who is it? Why are you yelling swami, swami? Sir, I'm not feeling well from a few days now. Would you kindly give me some pickle to have with my food? I'll slap you on the face now. Do you think this is a charity house to donate pickle to everyone who drops by? Go now. There's one who asks for pickle and another who sits and eats at my home. Where is my son Ayya gone when people are sweeping my house clean? Hey Achary, look at this Ayya swim fearlessly in this deep river. He doesn't care even if the river is full. No one in the surrounding villages can swim like him. He's daring. That is also right. I got three rupees. You won't even get half of what we need. At least we got this much before she caught us. Come let's go. Now you've learnt stealing too. Would you call it stealing if I take what you hid from me? Not bad man. You can boldly talk with your wife. I'm proud to say that you are my disciple. Puttamma, there's nothing wrong in this. Everything goes as offering to god. So you are the one who taught my husband to steal? These skills come by birth. I won't teach all these to my disciples. Shut up. You were the one who taught smoking weed when he was just smoking cigarette. Look, if you want any milk, come and drink anytime. but don't take my husband for smoking weed. Fine. We'll bring it here. Why don't you make a Ramarasa (intoxicating drink) out of it? We'll enjoy here in your name. Do as he says Putti. Beware. Don't you dare call my husband again when I'm home. Hmm. Did you understand Bundekyata? Don't call me when my wife's at home. Call me when she's not there. I'll come. Let's go now. What's this? We couldn't keep what we got with so much effort? Your bad luck. My wife caught us. Shall we go to Achary's place? Dear Lord Manjunatha of Dharmasthala By training the bulls for two months... My son has gone to the race confident of winning this time Bless him with victory. Year after year, Boothayya's son Ayya used to win the race. This year, my son Gulla has won it. As per village tradition, the winner gets this garland, silk scarf This silk scarf Though Gulla's bullocks won this race... aren't Bhaira's bullocks strong and good looking? Did you lay your eyes on them too? It's finished then. Everything's Manjunatha's blessing. Go to Dharmasthala (Pilgrimage) and return. Yes Father. Sister Girija Mahadevi, Are you fine? It's been a long time since we met last time. Arey, why are you looking so strangely? Have you forgotten me? She's Mahadevi, my father's friend Shankarayya's niece. Oh, isn't this the girl who accompanied you in our wedding? Yes Sir. We have been friends since we were very young. Are these children yours? They are adorable. Why do I not see Thaali(Mangalasutra) in your neck? Haven't found a good match for her. Shankarayya, we have one in our village belonging to your caste. Who is it? Devayya's son, Gulla. Yes yes. It will be a perfect match. When you are recommending, I will definitely enquire. Mahadevi It's getting late for bus. Let's go. Mahadevi, come to my village soon. I'll leave then sister, sir. ok Girijakka, You too should visit my place once. It's Kelagur estate near Kalasapura. You must visit. You are like Chanakya. You got a bund constructed to the river widening the riverbank and won all of it in auction. You made good amount of land for yourself. Count the money I spent to construct that bund and make that land cultivable. Whatever may be the cost, you earned it all in an year. Why do you envy that? (Sighs) If only my wife hadn't died, I would've lived in this farmhouse... and let the village house for rent. Even that would've earned some money. Oye, why are you so late? Megalatti Dodda Shetty has died. I had gone to see him last time. That's why I got late sir. Stop it. Put the body down. Why Sir? Pay my loan back and then take the body. Loan? When did my father take loan from you? When did he borrow money? If I hadn't lent the money, you wouldn't have married and had wife like now. Look at this stamp paper. Your father got this written and made his thumb impression. For 4000 rupees. 4000? 4000? Yes. Sir What you gave... what he took... We can talk all that later. First let them complete the funeral. If I leave them now then my loan will go into the grave too. I won't let them take the body until my loan is cleared. Is this the right time to recover your loan? I didn't care it's midnight when lending. I want my money including the interest here and now. Sir, I don't have any money left in the home. I have even borrowed money from Devayya for this funeral. Then borrow money from him and pay my money back. If I had 4000 rupees, I would've given it to you and let them finish the funeral. No problem if you don't have cash. Write it on paper for me. I trust you. Why should he write on the paper? I'll write it. You don't have the money to give your father a proper funeral. What do i do with your paper? Lick it with pickle? Not needed sir. I'll write it for you. Let them perform the rituals. Though Doddashetty borrowed money from me, he lived truthfully all through his life. Poor fellow, shouldn't have died this young. Come now, finish the funeral. Where are you going? Write me the paper first. Devayya was the only one who had escaped. Even he's consumed by that devil today. Don't sit idle thinking I'm out of village. Milk the cows twice daily, supply them to the customers and keep the money safely in the box. What? Keep all the money safely in the box. Don't just smoke it all away. Understood? You'll get late for the bus. Go now. You are giving so much work now. Don't just stay back where you are going. Come back soon I know everything. I'll leave then? OK Take care of the house. What work shall i do? Ha, I'll milk the cows and go to Achary's house. What's this Chikka? You're milking the cow wearing a saree? This cow doesn't like men. It'll give milk only if it sees women. That's why I'm wearing my wife's saree and milking the cow. oh ok. Don't kick. I'm very tired and thirsty. It can be quenched if you drink water. Who'll give? Who's there in the house? I am. If you wash your hands and feet and come inside, I'll give some sweet too with water. Will you keep giving water like this forever? If god wills that, I'll have to, wouldn't I? We met, I visited your estate and am drinking this water. All by his grace, isn't it? My brother left all the responsibilities of Mahadevi with me when he died. By marrying her off to your son, I'm leaving her in your care. Don't worry. Your girl... Though comes as a Daughter in law to our family, We'll look after her like my daughter. That's what i wish for. I'll ask the priest for an auspicious time for marriage. By all means. What is it Bhaira? What?Why are you wandering like a monkey bitten by a scorpion? I've lost my bullocks. Oh that? It's been a long time since my uncle Boothayya laid eyes on it, sold it in the market and by now its bones have been buried. Go. Boothayya Keep it there. Who has this kind of virtue in this village except Boothayya? Let it go. Now don't keep quiet. Take revenge for the fire set in your belly. Tell about the injustice to your people. Assemble them. Teach a befitting lesson to that Boothayya. Don't tell anyone that I told you to do all these. Boothayya!! Sir? Sir? Who's that? Shouting my name like that. It's me. Siddi Bhaira. Why are you yelling? Did your father die or your mother? Why did you steal and sell my bullocks? What? Have you come drunk first in the morning or are you certain that your life's over that you're ranting like this? It's not my life that's over. It's yours. Stop there. You dare rise your hand against me? I'll kill you. Che, What's this uncle? Why did you come here to die over a dead issue? Go, go. Let it go and save your life for your woman and children. Go. Go.(winking) I say go. This dog dared to touched me? I shouldn't let it without stamping Singalayya. What is this uncle? You quarreling with these petty people. Why use Brahmastra (mighty mythological weapon) on a sparrow? You don't know. If I teach this one, the whole village will learn of the consequences. If not taken care of, then tomorrow everyone will rise against me. My hand!! I know who set fire to my house. If I don't set fire to their house, then my name is not Siddi Bhaira. Poor man's anger only makes his jaw ache You shouldn't speak of such things. Come now, we'll go to our house. Come. Why do you look at that? It's over. Come now. Uncle... Uncle? Uncle, what happened? I slipped and fell down. Can't get up. Right hand... Right leg... I have no control over them. That means... Paralysis... You are struck again you say... Ayyu... Ayyu... Your father had a stroke, come help me lift him and get him inside. Father? father? Singalayya: First lift him up. Gulla, You were alone till now. Now you are a married man. Just don't be imprudent thinking you've responsibilities on your shoulders now. To acquire wealth... Don't leave Dharma... If you can... If god blesses you... Help people... Live harmoniously trusting your fellow villagers. Don't trust Don't trust anybody in the village. Everyone's a thief If you pity the farmers, You'll suffer Without heat, butter won't melt. Just like that, if he doesn't feel the heat... a farmer won't pay up. If you keep chiding him, putting his hand in the pocket, he'll take his money out If you slip and start fraternising, the money he has taken out, will slip back into his pocket. Remember that That Devayya. His house has been a thorn in my side. Always keep an eye on that. I have the papers... Use it when time comes. Take this Even if they swindle one rupee, kill one for that. Father? father (cries) I tried all night in all neighbouring villages Nobody's willing to help us lift uncle's body even when I offered to pay money. Why acquire so much wealth when one couldn't get people to help perform his last rites? Doesn't matter I know how to finish the funeral. Sir? Why did you come? Who invited you here? Village's elderly man has passed away I came to pay him my last respects and help you with the last rites If this is what you people intended, everybody should have come. You've come alone. Have the rest of them died? Devayya, I don't need anybody's help. Go back When he's says he doesn't need help, what are you standing here for? Go. At last you came forward to give me water. Will you wash your feet and come inside or just keep staring at me? If I eat I'll only satiate my hunger It won't satisfy my eyes By looking at you the hunger only grows Alright, I'll keep looking at you You keep looking at me forgetting to sow or toil in the fields Pray not say something like that. You are my god given Mahadevi. I'll do as you say. Tell me what do you want me to do? Wash your hands and feet, have your meals and then go to toil in the fields. Alright Ey Sannashetty, stop your oil mill. Come settle your debts. Where will I bring 4000 from? Even If I work day and night, I am barely able to meet my expenses. Then why did your father borrow money to get a beggar like you married? Sir Your father knew that my father didn't borrow money for my marriage. What did you say? Boothayya has produced fake papers in my father's name. And now you're after me using that. If you say that it's fake papers again I'll go to court and have your property auctioned. Auction if you want or even burn us for that, we don't have a penny to give. Do whatever you want Yes I will. I know what to do. On your father's funeral, that Devayya who signed the surety bond if I kick him, he'll cough up the money along with you. Ey, what is it that you said? You are talking loosely taking my father's name? the situation demanded it. Pretending to help the villagers, your father is swindling all our money Have you been smoking any weed or what? Whose money has my father swindled? Our money Your father gave surety on this fellow's behalf Did he ensure he paid back? That day he spoke like a big man. Why has kept quiet until now? Pigs... Pigs waiting to hog up all our money Hey mind your tongue There is no bigger pig than your father. Destitutes Widows Innocents sparing no one your father hogged up all their money like a porcupine Gulla Ayyu Let me go uncle I'll break his head Will police let you go for this? Ayyu Your father killed so many so secretly You should handle it like that instead of quarreling out in the open. Come I'll explain Hey You dare raise your hand against me? If I don't put you in jail and make you toil then my name's not Ayyu, son of Boothayya Hey If I don't finish you off by then then I'm not Devayya's son Gulla Remember that Why do you quarrel like this Gulla? Let it go. isn't it because you people didn't raise your voice, that that Boothayya reined and his son seeks to do the same today If only you had taught him a lesson then. A cub born of tiger should act like one. If you cower like a mouse, the whole village will consume you. Let's go Uncle, I don't care if I have to spend a lakh(100000) We will teach him a lesson Why this persistence? Calm yourself down and think about it. I decided that only after thinking thoroughly The villagers hate us already And now if you go to court over this, then god save us. What words you speak Your husband seeks to fight the one who stood up against him and hold the whole village in his control You ask him to stay behind like a coward? Not you, I pay no heed even to my dead father who's in heaven I won't let that Gulla without cuffing him and sending to jail. Let's go Uncle. Please stop sir. You shouldn't commit a mistake because the other did. I apologise to you for my sons mistakes Please forgive This is nice It's like beating one in the square and beg forgiveness inside a room. Devayya I won't let this go until I see your son goes to grave Don't sir, please My son and you are both young. You were born in the same village You drink the same river water You grew up playing on the same ground If you cross swords like this Can anyone live peacefully in future? Possible If you cut the hands of one who fights you, you can live peacefully. Sannayya, please listen to me Hot blood Makes you talk like that Money will make you speak like that Filling the head with revenge This anger spoils a man I fall at your feet Please forgive, please forgive Ayyu Gulla.. Gulla.. Leave him leave Father how can I let go someone who kicked you? When I don't take offense why do you get angry? Father I'm your son. I must protect your honour How dare you disobey your father? Go home. I am telling you, go home. You were saved today My father intervened and saved you. Hey who lives will be decided in court Time will come Medical certificate to certify that you were assaulted. OK This is the security bond his father signed First, according to IPC section 324, filing a criminal case, while this shakes him, if we file a civil case against his father They're finished you say? finish them Fees... I don't care about the cost I want him sent to jail We shall I'll have the plaint, police complaint typed You come back later to sign it. Now pay some 1000 as advance When shall we come? Come back after two hours Alright I forgot to tell him something. You wait here. I'll come back. Swami The sugarcane is juicy squeeze it however you like. But along with that... sprinkle a drop or two on me swami come what may.. whatever the cost he should be cuffed and taken in a procession around the village. That's all. I came to tell you that. I'll leave. Alright At last Ayyu went to court. He has filed a criminal case saying you assaulted and attempted to murder him Let him file. I'll also hire a lawyer. I'll argue that he has filed the case because of his envy I'll make his own case turn into a noose for him. Do. When you destroy each others house You end losing everything and go begging You mean I should go to jail? I should jump into the ring, break his back and teach him I'll see. Who'll be willing to become his witness? How he wins the case Case, court and lawyer. These are the very things. That ruin a farmer's life. Go. Go. [Hayavadanarao - Advocate] [Chanting Stutis] Sir? Who's that? It's me. Wait I'll come. Namaskara sir. Yes, namaskara What were you doing with the door shut? What to do I've no time. I have to attend a court in the morning, another in the noon, and another in the evening I've no time to take off my coat You go to all those courts with only one coat? Do police where different uniform for different stations? By the way, what's your case? civil or criminal? Gulla take it out. Please see what it is. This is a very big case. He too has hired a big lawyer. To fight a case with lawyers like these, there is only one in town. That's me. Yes sir. That's why we've come to you. What to do? I've no time. If I leave you, you'll surely lose the case. Sir. Please consider this case. To fight a case with such a lawyer, My fees? How much will it cost? Not that much. You'll have to pay 200 every time I attend the court. OK sir. We'll make an arrangement. Whenever you come to court I'll keep a count. We'll settle at the end of the month. Are you a milkman? Yes sir. That's my family business. I don't add water. That's why you say you'll keep a count? Court matters don't work like that. You have to pay as you go. Alright sir. Pay 100rs as advance now. I'll prepare the papers. You can come in the evening and sign. By the way, what village are you from? Jalahalli Ok Jalahalli. I've heard of it. I've heard that butter is very good in your village. Bring some next time. Sir, you win this case. I'll bring you 50 seru(a unit of measure). Why did you yield to the poison of hate? To lose all the happiness. Oh fool. Though Gulla won the case in district court, you won the case for us in high court. Same way that civil case... Anyway including court fee.. we have got it decreed that he has to pay 3678 rupees. You got it decreed... But... you shouldn't have agreed for installments. That is court's decision, there's nothing I can do. Anyway he's a defaulter now... if we proceed with action... You mean, it's like killing the fallen with rock... Teaching Ayyu a lesson... saying you'll get him cuffed... was like hitting a boulder with hand. What to do? Luck is not on our side. Say Gulla... Why not go to Sugreeva's court? It's not Sugreeva's court you idiot... It's Supreme amma's court (Supreme court). Let's go there Gulla. Let's think about it later. Take this. I only have this much. Get yourselves something to eat and come to Bus stand. I'll have bought the tickets. What will you have? I'm not hungry Poor fellow. When he had the money, he gave them away in bunches. he probably has only this much left now. But how to get meals for 4 with 2 rupees? We have to somehow manage. Come, let's see if we can manage. Do something. You have meals? Don't you see the board? How much for full meals? 2 rupees. 2 rupees? give me. It's 8 rupees for 4. I'll have the meals. They have all had their meals. They've just come with me. Should we buy tickets for that too? No need. Go and sit down. Manjunatha one full meals I've paid 2 rupees, bring a big (banana) leaf Take this Hey Sannashetty Build a dam out of rice and swim in the sambar. Achary, just keep looking how I'll swim. Rice. Rice. Rice. Bring some sambar. Hey bring some rice. There's no rice. No rice? Hey Mister(calling hotel owner), come here. You keep quiet. What is this? He's saying there's no rice left? Is this your full meals? Look here, three vessels full of rice is over. He's not even started curd rice. Serving only three spoonful, you say three vessels? What now? will you serve rice now... or deduct money for what I've eaten and give me the rest? Swami, come I'll give. Manjunatha, there's full meals from now on. only plate meals. change the board. - OK sir. Get us some beetle leaf with that. Didn't it end where it had to? wise men knew... One who wins the case loses... and the one who loses dies... No.. never suffer this... taking quarrels to court... and be left without even a sandal. You didn't listen to me even after I warned you many times. Is it over now? Did the court decision settle it? Along with the court's decision... everything else was also decided then, you say. It's settled then you say. Sit down. I was worried you might not come. It's like goddess Gouri herself came here. Born in the same village... we grew up playing together. By god's grace got married to in the same town. But... We are unable to talk to each other face to face. When your husband and mine are fighting... how can we talk. Let it go. You've become so weak. Is your husband taking care of you? He loves me more than his life. My father-in-law cares for me like his own daughter. I don't lack anything. Then tell your husband... at least now that he forgets everything and become friends with my husband. If they unite... how our life would be. I know sister. Even father-in-law told the same thing a thousand times. but he won't listen. Just like your husband, mine is adamant. What can we do? It's late. I'll leave. Wait a moment. Take this. No. I don't want this. Today's Gouri (goddess) festival. A married woman like you must not be sent empty handed. Take. I'll leave. Mahadevi What's all this? Where did you bring this from? Girijakka gave this. 'Your husband has become a pauper after the case...' 'come I'll give you some alms' is what she said. Isn't it? It's Gouri festival. She only called me for Kumkum (a ritual) I went She gave me all this. Then you should've taken only the kumkum. Leaving that. Rice, grams and sugar... with that another 100 rupees. Why did you agree to take all this? I didn't see her putting 100 rupees in the basket. She gave without you asking? You lie to me? Gulla, Gulla, leave her. Why do you beat this pregnant? She has insulted me. Bringing all this from Ayya's wife, she's lying now. No uncle,no. I vow in Manjunatha's name, I didn't ask them anything. Take this. Throw this at their face and come back. And tell them. this Gulla will never bow down and beg them even if he dies. Go. Why? I don't deserve to keep this. If I take this basket back... it's not good for you or me. The day my husband and your husband fought... and went to court... our bad times started then. Mahadevi How long have you been doing this? The very enemy who crosses sword with me... is supplied with money, food and grains from my home? Now I know... even though Gulla had become a destitute... how he managed court matters. Tell me. What all have you given them while you threw dust in my eyes? I've given them nothing. I have never thrown dust in your eyes. I had called her for Gouri festival. She came. I gave her dakshina and gave her this basket. Dakshina(money)? of 100 rupees? Did you bring it from your father's home? Girija. If she steps into my house once again... I'll kill you both with the revolver. Beware. Hey, let me join with you. My father will scold me if I play with you. Go. Let me join you in the games. We won't play with you. Go Come. Let's go. Mother, mother. No one's letting us join the games. Everybody runs away when they see us. Our life has fallen to this. where will it take us in future? What is it? See their faces. You'll know. No one's letting them join the games. No need. No need for my children to mingle with those poor and dirty kids. You mean... should the growing kids sit at home without playing in the sun. Yes. Then these two will also become like their father and grandfather. Even if they live in the village... they will live their lives like lonely owls. Only if we live like that we can control these people. Swami. Swami Who's that? What is it? spare me some pickles.. Hey, you didn't get rid of that pickle disease? Only when I eat it does it satisfy me, doesn't it? Please give me some. Do you think this is charity home for pickles? If you come asking for pickles again... I'll break your legs. Go. Pickles. Mr.Sambayya? Oh, please come. Court has given permission to auction Devayya's house. Auction. Auction. Devayya's house is auctioned. For the debt owed to Boothayya's son, Sambayya... As per court's order... Tuesday at 10:30 AM Devayya's house is auctioned. Those who wish... can participate and buy the property in auction. Auction. Devayya's house is auctioned. Auction My house is auctioned. Did you hear that, Mahadevi? My life... has fallen to the streets. How can go out with respect? After losing the honour... what's the difference if one lives or dies? My grandfather... father... I... This house where you husband grew up... is slipping out of hands before your child is even born. Over. It's over. Our bond with this house is over. Father. Mahadevi. Mahadevi Father in law had so much money. We couldn't even find four people. Devayya didn't even have proper food. The whole village is seeing him off. This is the fortune one must earn. Why are you sharpening it? Why are you honing the machete like this? To have a sharp edge. The head should fall down as soon as it hits. Whose head? That Ayya, who brought death to my father. His head. Murder. Will you murder Ayya? Yes. Him. I can rest only when I have killed him. My father can rest in peace. After that? After that police will take you. Let them hang me. By killing a crook like Ayya... my name will be praised all over the village. You lost everything by adamant like this. You lost a god like father. By losing your life, you'll make me beg me in the streets. No. No. Not you. Even if the god himself told me, I wouldn't stop. I'll kill him wherever I see him. His head will fall to this machete. Then kill me before that. It's better that I die when you're alive. Mahadevi, don't stop me now. Don't come in front of me until I've killed him, Or talk to me. Go. Please listen to me. Go. He's honing his machete? to kill me? Even after I taught him a lesson... he still don't get it, does he? His father's death has made him like that. He says he'll kill you wherever he sees you. Let him come. Before he lifts his weapon... I'll fire the bullets and spill the blood out of his heart. I know sir. You have a pistol. And money to escape from law. What do we have? Losing everything... Kumkum on my forehead... and thaali is all I am left with. Please don't take this too sir. No. I'll save your thaali... and remove my wife's huh? Mahadevi. This is Boothayya's son Ayyu. To all those scoundrels who pounce on me... I won't leave them without firing my bullets. Don't sir. You are wise... educated... and one who must show mercy to the destitute. Till his anger dies down... Please hide somewhere for three days... and save us Why are you telling me this? Go and tell him. He can listen to you... or instead tell him to dig his own grave. He'll drop dead even before he steps into the house. You can come back later for his dead body. Go. Sir, Sir. Girijakka, Girijakka. Both are not listening. Doesn't matter who kills whom. We'll stand on the streets like beggars. I don't care if I don't have food or clothes I only want my husband to live and now... even that is in danger. How do we endure these murders? Mahadevi... Mahadevi... Stop. Why? Don't go out. If I won't, he'll come here. Let him come. We'll reason with him. For one who's coming to chop the head, it's not the advice that he deserves... should kill him. What do you gain from that? Seeing how he'll end up... the whole village will fear me and prostrate in front of me. Father kept telling the same and behaved merciless like a butcher. That's why in front of my father... the whole village used to shake. That's what has come as death to you. the injustice you do now... will come as death to our children. Girija I've tolerated enough. If I keep quiet now... the whole family will be perished. That's why I stand before you. Tell me. Why is that Gulla after you? His life is over that's why. No. The injustice you did.. has angered him. riled him up. You got his house auctioned. When he could not tolerate the shame, Devayya committed suicide. I only got it auctioned for the debt he owed me... I didn't hand him the rope. You didn't give the rope. But you tom-tommed in the whole village. Poor fellow. Only if you had shown some mercy, Devayya would have lived. You hastened. He died because of you. You are the murderer. You Devayya was a poor man. When he died, the whole village went to his funeral. My uncle was rich. When he died, because we couldn't find four people to help, we had to take him in a cart. If you keep on building these evil thoughts, when we die in the future, we won't even get a cart to carry our bodies. Remember that. Stop. If you want to follow in father's footsteps, and don't care if the village turns against us, and be adamant about it, then kill me and my children first, and do whatever you want to. Hey Linga. Gulla's wife has fallen into the water. Go save her. I can't Only Ayya can dive into this mighty river. Ayya? Even the wet grass thrown between them will catch fire. Will he save Gulla's wife? Go. Go quickly fetch a blanket. Girijakka. Having lost house, father and everything. he stands like a pauper. you thought, 'why to stay with him' and decided to go to heaven, is it? If you had gone, I would've stayed back? Tell me. Why did you do this? Why did you jump into the river? To kill Ayya... You had picked up the machete. To kill you, Ayya picked his gun. I thought of killing myself when I still had the fortune of you being alive. If someone else had saved you, I would've bowed to them touching their feet. But... But the one who saved your life is my enemy Ayya. He taunts me 'you hapless who couldn't save your wife's life... see that I've saved her life.' He has dishonoured me. Under the pretence of helping me, he insulted me. Greetings Vakil (Lawyer) saab. Come Harakmal, sit down. Fan, sofa, office, house, you have changed so much. What do you bring? Civil case or criminal? Half of this and half of that. I want to decree on Jalahalli Gulla. What does he have now? Whatever he had, he has given it to me. He's given my money to you? Then you clear his debts. You're intelligent. Fine. But what will you get if you get a decree on him now? If I don't get anything, I'll have warrant issued and have him sent to jail. Don't don't it for free. Charge for your service. Even if you give me money, I shouldn't file a case against my old clients. That's professional ethics. You wouldn't understand. Go see another lawyer. Oh forget it. I'll see some other lawyer. Ameen saab, this is Devayya's son, Gulla, catch him. Gulla, for the money you owe this gentleman, he has got the warrant issued in your name. As per court's order, you're arrested now. Why did you do this sir? If you had waited for another two days... You would have fled. How will you clear my debt? Property, money what do you have? Even if I've lost everything. I've not lost my strength. If you put him in jail, will you get your money? No, sir. You leave him now. We'll somehow return your money. What'll you do? how'll you clear? Tell. I'll labour. Even clean somebody's bathroom if need be. We husband and wife will both work, and clear your debts. Now let us go. I've listened to these promises many a times. Ameen saab, take him. Stop Ameen saab. Stop. Why did you come here? To laugh at me? See. I'm going to jail. Go tom-tom it to everyone. Let's go Ameen saab. Stop. You want your money or you want him sent to jail? If I send him to jail, I'll have to pay for it. I want only the money. I'll give you your money. No. I don't need your charity. What'll you do in jail? I'll do manual labour. I'll do whatever I'm told. What do you care? Can you clear your debt with that? Will your pregnant wife be happy with that? Or will you be have honour in this village? His debt... I'll clear it. I said I don't need your charity. Didn't you hear? It's not charity, a debt. A debt to take me out of another? If you don't repay that debt, you'll have to go to jail. Even if you don't repay this one, you don't have to go to jail. How'll I clear your debt? You mentioned that you'll do manual labour. Do the same work in my home. Take your wages and repay the debt. Alright. Let's go sir. I'll give your money. Even if I've lost everything I've not forgotten our enmity. Until I've buried you and avenged my father's death, I can't rest. By saving me from jail, don't think my anger has died down. Tell me whatever job you want me to do. I'll work. Let's go. It's a boy. He's cutting wood relentlessly since morning. Haven't drunk any water or taken any rest. Poor fellow. Enough. Tell him to go home. Let him see his Mahadevi and his son. Gulla. Why are you working without rest? It's the servant's job. Your working with all integrity. A job that's supposed to take a week for four men... you're doing it in one day. Then take four people's wages. You'll clear your debts sooner. I don't want your pity. Give me one man's wage, that's enough. Singalayya: Carry them quickly. Ayya shouldn't know that I'm with you. Hey Gulla. We thought we could steal some thinking it's you on watch. But you'll hand us over? Now I'm his servant. A loyal dog. The one who ruined your life, made your father to die, don't you have that fire in you to avenge? I serve him like his son only till I've repaid his debt. After that, I'm my father's son. Once the debt is repaid, I'll have my revenge. If any of you come here again, I'll cut them and bury under the trees. Go. Why did you come to work today? Your debt was cleared yesterday. From today, you're debt free. Independent. I too know that. I came here to say that I'm leaving. Why do you want to go? Everybody likes you so much. No work gets done without you. Be here as you like, independent, happily like my brother. I had to repay you, I stayed. Now I've to take revenge, I'm going. Stop. Stop this animal sacrifice. Why should we stop? We can't. A fair that's been stopped for three years, we are celebrating this year. Celebrate the festival But In the name of celebration, don't kill this buffalo. Why should we stop? Shouldn't we please our Goddess Maramma by offering this sacrifice? Yes ask him that. A great power who's mother to all universe, you want to please her with buffalo? Is our mother so hungry that she'll eat an innocent animal? Then? What our ancestors did was wrong? What are you talking? Our ancestors who were taken over by superstitious beliefs, had some bad customs too. Only thing that must be sacrificed, is our ignorance. not this animal that breathes with life. Can we fore go all our customs just because this man says so? Can we fore go? [Crowd says not possible] You all want to sacrifice. I'm the only one who opposes it. As you wish. Let that mother save you. Do you know why Ayya opposes the sacrifice? If we don't kill, then village will suffer. stopping this festival is enough... to bring all plagues to the village. He's scheming, if the whole village is cleared... then he can stay alone and own this land. It seems like that. It seems to you? Well you're that dumb. Fools who don't know how to write or read. He knows that if he lifts his sword, you'll bow your heads down like sheep. Your forefathers worked hard only to fill Boothayya's coffers. We worked and filled Ayya's... Understand this clearly. In future, your children will work for Ayya's children. Is this village only there to serve one Ayya's house? [Crowd shouts no] Is there anyone in this village who doesn't owe a debt to Boothayya? In future, if Ayya files a case, then everybody should work for him. You know that? Do you know papers with thumb impressions lie in his house like bales of hay? First we should grab those papers back. [Crowd shouts yes] With that... we should steal all that money he has stashed by ruining us. [Crowd shouts yes] If you all join hands, we can do it today. Now. Yes. Today. Now. First do this. Then we'll finish the festival. [Crowd shouts yes] Break the back of anyone who opposes you when entering. cut their hands. If they won't budge even to that, chop their heads off. Who? Who's that? Don't open the door. No one's answering. Why have they come at this hour? Festival is going on... they must have come to ask for something. I'm scared. Don't fear. You sleep. I'll look into it. Singalayya: Hey Chikka, Sannashetty , Achary... Come here. Go inside. Those who touch women and children... and snatch their gold, I'll cut their hands. Beware. Come. We'll go to house near the bunds. Greetings. Even if you didn't lodge the complaint, we came to know. We've come here to take action as per law. Please cooperate. What do you need? I've gathered all the villagers. Among these, who broke into your house and who set fire to it? I've enquired each of them. No one's telling the truth. Can you please tell what happened? No one among these broke into my house. What are you saying? I'm saying what I need to. Nobody broke into my house. Do you fear that all the villagers are united? I'll get you all the support. Please tell. I've said. Then how did this house catch fire? In the room where the cattle are tied, electric lamp wasn't working. The worker who took the lantern and went in there, he forgot there. At some point, the lantern must have been kicked by the cattle, which lit the hay and the house. Then. All the villagers helped together... and saved my wife and children. If you say so... who shall we file the case against. Don't file any case on anyone. No one has done any wrong. Somebody must have given you wrong information and troubled you. Please forgive me. Sir, telegram. My aunt in Mysore seems to be seriously ill. I have to leave urgently. I'll leave Inspector. Forgive me. Just two days. I'll be back after I've seen her. I'm alone here. There's nothing to fear. I'll come as soon as possible. I'll leave? Chandru, Gouri. Mother, mother. What is it child? Will we drown like our house? No. I'm with you, am in not? Why is it sounding like never before? By the sound of the river, it seems Boothayya's bunds must have given up. Girijakka and her children? They're in the house near that bund. Their fate? Ayya is also not in house. Madam. Gulla. Come . Come fast. Don't fear. Don't fear. I'm coming. I'm coming. Gulla, come. Gulla, come. Madam, hold the children tightly. Hold the children tightly. Madam, please throw some water out. Gulla. Get the children down. Gulla. Ayya who knows swimming, jumped into the river and saved your wife that day. Not knowing how to swim, you jumped into the river and saved his wife and children. That way both have cleared all kinds of debt to each other. Good. Good. Come. Let's go. Gulla. Without caring for your life, you jumped into the river... and saved my wife and children. Now, I'm in your debt. How shall I repay you? Leave it sir. What did I do? You saved my wife. When I was to go to jail, you saved my honour. Since my anger didn't die down then, and because my eyes were red, whatever you did seemed red to me. It's you who have helped. By not handing over those who broke into your house, You saved this village's honour. Mine's nothing compared to what you have done. Ayyu. To secretly take revenge on your father, I joined their group and did a lot of injustice to you. Leave it, Uncle. There's no man who hasn't done any wrong. I didn't realise that you were so broad minded. Only after Girija made me understand, I too became a human. A man cannot live separated from society. It's paradise when we live together. Yes, sir. Take this. All the things that we looted from your house. They've brought everything. Sir. Everybody's bringing back everything they took. But I can't bring back what I've taken. What is it? Pickles. I drank pickles from Ayya's house like juice. How can I bring it back? Sir? Nobody shall give anything back. This belongs to you. This is yours. From now on. I'm not Boothayya's son Ayya. Son of the village, Sambayya. Please let me live amongst you. The eclipse that had fallen on our village is cleared today. Come. Let's go. We shall continue the festival and seek the blessings of the goddess. Let's go. It's paradise if we live together.
