--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website -Where are you? -Just a bit more. -We're getting close. -Really? Are we there yet? Happy anniversary, love! Happy anniversary, love. I can't believe we've been together for a year. Yes, I've been crazy about you for a year. Right. And you've done nothing but flatter me for a year. -Beautiful, isn't it? -I love it here. You're ten thousand times more beautiful than all these. Really? -You're still in love with me? -Yep. -Until now? -Yep! Yep! Yep! You're still as beautiful as that time I saw you again. Dude. That's right, Lia. If you were my high school teacher, I'd have perfect attendance and probably would be valedictorian. Hey! Stop bugging Lia. Being a teacher is an honorable job. And you know what? You should actually be thanking them for their service to Cebu. Did you get that from New York? Or are you training for the elections? Come on! Aren't you used to Philip always rescuing Lia? He's been doing it since high school. Philip, you'll not deny it. You've got a crush on Lia. That's true. Okay, guys. I won't deny it. To be honest, I still do. It's a good thing I came along with Dad. Can I invite you for dinner tonight? Seriously? What if I say no? Then I'll come back tomorrow. Then the next day. Then the day after that, until you say yes. I'm sorry, Mom. It's been a while since I last visited. You know what, Mother? There's a lot happening in Lia's life lately. It's crazy! Won't you tell your mom about the prince charming who's been trying to win you over? Well, she probably hasn't moved on from you-know-who. I've already moved on. Then why did you snub him yesterday? You know why. He's a Cordero. Well, you're one to talk. You don't like being judged yourself, right? Why don't you try to get to know him first? Hey, you! Hi. I'm sorry if I offended you last time. And since we're not in school, maybe I can... -Hi, Philip! -Hi! Oh, can I invite you for a date? Sorry, not interested. I don't date. Heartbreak? I know the feeling. Eventually, you're gonna realize that he's not worth it. And that thinking about him is a waste of time. But you know, that's okay, because look at this. Life is so beautiful! Why should it be stopping you from loving again? Look at the view. It's so-- You're crazy! So, is it a date? Come here. Philip Cordero? They should've made it Mr. and Mrs. Cordero instead. Nice ring to it, right? -I'm sorry. -I have an idea. Let's put this right there. That way, I won't here you blabbering. Isn't it because you're tempted to kiss me? Philip! -Thank you. -We're done. Where is she? Is Lia still coming? Yeah, Mom. Actually, she's on her way. She just took her grandma for a checkup. Are you really sure about this girl? What do you mean, Mom? Lia's all right. She's smart. She's beautiful. That's it? You've brought nicer women here before. -Like Eunice, for example. -I knew it. You know, Mom's right. You can do better. And do you know the father? Damn! He's crazy! Philip... What do you even see in her? Well, unlike most people here... she believes in me. Lia, just hear me out for three minutes. Please. Philip, please... It's okay. Let's not push it. It's too complicated. I know it is. And I don't know what else we'll face after this. But one thing's for sure, okay? One thing's for sure. I'm madly in love with you. And if you'll have me, I will do everything I can to protect you. I will fix this. I'll make this work. I just need you to be there with me. I love you, Lia. I love you, too. Love... All my life... I've been unsure. I've been running away from almost everything in my life. But now, I'm certain. I'm certain I want to see a future with you. Will you hold my hand and say yes to a life with me? Love... Will you marry me? Yes. Ten thousand times, yes. Yes. This could be the perfect place for your prenup shoot. Why here? Well, because of the story behind it. This shrine was built as a testament of a man's love for his wife. And they were actually married for 53 years. They also said the architectural design was made to withstand the test of time. Just like their love. How romantic, right? For him to build her a temple? He must have a lot to apologize for, you know. Come on, love. Everyone's got a secret. We don't know what they went through. Wait a second. Do you have many secrets? Tell me. What is your secret? I'm not telling you. You might stop loving me if I do. We never know. Good morning, Cebu! Today will be a very special day because we have a beautiful couple here with us that the Cebuanos love to keep up with. Not just because they're beautiful but because their fairytale wedding is about to happen in just a few months. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the most sought-after bachelor of Cebu and the lovely bride-to-be that caught his heart, Mr. Philip Cordero and Miss Lia Marquez. Lia, you look stunning. How go the wedding preparations? Everything happened so fast, right? You guys only met one year ago? We've known each other since high school. But we reconnected during our high school reunion last year. So, why rush, right? Is it because, Philip, you're campaigning? No, no, no. Of course, it's not about the campaign. You know, I'm truly in love with Lia and... When you meet someone... and you fall in love with them, you know when they're the one. So... What's the point of waiting? You know, especially now, there are rumors... that maybe the Corderos' time is up? I'm sure you know about those stories. They say that maybe the new administration should be someone new and fresh. Well... That's their opinion. And yes, they're right. It's time for a younger Cordero. Love, I looked stupid earlier. No, of course not. Give that to me. You still have a year to make up for it. The election is still a year away, okay? So stop being so negative. Okay. I was the one who looked stupid. I was so nervous. My armpits were sweating. You put tissue on your armpits? -They don't stink. Smell it. -Why is it wet? They're so wet! Get that away from me! I was nervous, okay? It was my first time on TV! These tissues saved the day. You really make everything better for me. Really? -Despite my wet underarms? -That's why I love you. -Even if my-- Yours are wet too! -Just a bit. -Your armpits are wet! -Love! You're naughty! We could've avoided this if they only had that bridge fixed. It's causing so much trouble! -Dude, what happened? -A truck broke down. -Have you reported this? -Not yet. I'll do it. Move back! It's perfect. I agree. You look stunning, Miss Lia. I told you. You know what? That wedding gown is probably my best creation ever, especially made for the wedding of the century. The materials I used even came from Europe. What do you think, ma'am? Anton... Is that...? Is that the one we chose? Something is off. I don't know. It must be the train. But it's lovely. -Is that the one on the sketch? -Sketch? No. This is what's on the sketch. This is what I wanted. Actually, this is even better than what I imagined. -Thank you. -Oh, thank you, darling. Well, anyway, Joanna, we still have time, right? In case we wanna tweak something. If it won't look good, let's not force it. I was thinking of lending you my custom-made Oscar de la Renta wedding gown from Paris. But then I thought also, it might not fit. Of course, I was slimmer then. Don't worry, ma'am. Anton and I will review the original sketches. Yes. Please do. I'll go ahead. -Thank you. -Okay, Lia. Bye. Lia! I told my stylist to bring you new clothes before the wedding. Thank you. I'll go ahead. Wait. Are you excited? About the wedding? Of course. Good. I wanted to ask you this. What is it about Philip that you liked? I know I never got a chance to ask you, so indulge me. Was it him being a Cordero a factor? Well... He is the most genuine person I know. And honestly, if he weren't a Cordero, I probably would've liked him more. You're funny. I'll see you, Lia. Well, how long can he keep that up? I cannot say, but I wouldn't be here if I wasn't worried. So, what should we do, Michelle? Michelle, what happened? For the first time, Gonzales is leading the polls because of the school he's building. We need to know our next move or else, it's a landslide win. Why can't we just go viral on the campaigns? To be more visible. -Just like the interview. -Their interview was a disaster. Look at the optics. They were stiff. She looked like his aunt. They weren't looking at each other. They didn't even look like they were in love! Cut us some slack, Michelle. You know we're not used to it. Well, that's exactly the point, Philip. We are not selling the reality. We are selling the dream! You together can provide an aspiration. You are the fairytale, the RomCom of politics. The prince who fell in love with a simple girl of Cebu. Well, that's the truth. Then make me believe it. We all know that that will not be enough. The only sure way to win is to destroy the competition. But, Dad! I agree with your father, Philip. Gonzales will take all of this away from us. Just like that. I can't let that happen. We just can't let that happen. Well, I'm sorry, but I promised that I would fight fair. I won't destroy anyone just to win. I'm the one running. I will do things the way I want to. Until now, you're still stubborn. If only Andrew did not die in that accident. Well, he's gone! My brother's dead! That's why I got stuck in this situation! What if we have the bridge fixed? Wow! That's a groundbreaking idea, dear. Have you ever had a bridge fixed, Lia? Do you know how much that bridge would cost? Two seventy million. One million per meter. That's why... we shelved the construction in the first place. I'm sorry. I just thought, it has greatly inconvenienced the people of Cebu. If we have it fixed, it will make their lives better. They'll vote for Philip. That's if we could get funds for it. We could have sponsors. High privileged ones. In return, we can have their names written on the bridge, and their contributions will be immortalized forever. That's not a bad idea. And I'm sure a lot of people would want their names on that bridge. They will compete against each other to see how much money they can put on that bridge. The only problem now is... where do we find an engineering firm who's going to able to do this in a few months time? Mom! Thanks, Mom. Paging the supervisor of the meat section. Please proceed to the customer service area. Lia, my daughter. How are you doing? I'm good. I saw on TV that you're getting married. Can I attend your wedding? I'll just be at the back. I just want to see you. -Mom! -I need to... I already got what you asked for. Is he your boyfriend? No. -This is Nico, Jomar's son. -Hello. -Get some cabbage. -Okay, Mom. He lives with us. He's like my own child. Your own child? Your own child. I'll go ahead. -Grandma... -Lia... So Lia, you're resigning? Yes, Philip's going through a lot. He needs me. Is that why he asked you to stop teaching? -Why is he deciding for you? -It's my decision. That's the reason I refuse to go to your wedding. A Cordero will just ruin your life. Oh, my God. Ruin my life? He's a good man. He's not like the other Corderos. They're all the same. Corrupt, cheaters, arrogant people. Is that what you think of me, grandma? That every man I love will just end up hurting me? -Is this about that guy-- -It's about my father. The man who also betrayed your daughter. And Philip is not that kind of guy. That's why I'm marrying him. Great news! I just got off the phone with a Dubai-based engineering firm that launched their satellite office in Lahug. And they just said yes to their first client. This is it! See? Michelle, thank you. Thank you. This way, sir. Excuse me, Sir Philip. -Sir Philip! -Hi! Arvin Enriquez. Engineering consultant for BME. Philip Cordero, and this is my fiancée, Lia Marquez. -Hi! Pleased to meet you. -Nice to meet you. By the way, thank you so much for accepting the project. -Oh-- -Sorry. Excuse me. Honestly, even I was surprised. Our senior engineer pushed this to happen. He's also from Cebu. Really? He's Cebuano? That's good, so we can thank him personally. You might know him. His name is Wado. Eduard Dela Costa. He told me he was already here. Wait, I'll call him. Speaking of, the devil. He's here. -Hey, dude! -Dude! -This is Mr. Cordero. -Mayor. Not yet. Not yet but soon-to-be, right? I'm Engineer Dela Costa. You can just call me Philip. Okay, Philip. Lia. Hi. It's nice to see you. Thank you for meeting with us. So, engineer, I've seen your credentials and... You're well-established in your profession. Thank you. I'm just curious. Why come back to Cebu? Well, Philip... It's simple. I... wanna get back what I lost. You see... I've been away for many years and... this is my home, I want to give back. That's why we set up shop right here in Cebu. But how can we be sure you can deliver? Can you commit? Given the deadline? Can we commit? Yes, we can, Lia. I'll be honest with you. We've projects all over the world. But like I said earlier, I want to give back. So, you can say that this project is... special to me. Just like it is for you... Mayor. No, the bridge is happening. It's not. Listen to me, Philip. You're unwinnable as it is. Let's get real. Who's going to vote for the son of a corrupt mayor who just replaced his dead brother? This bridge is your only chance for the people to love you. And we're going to stop it just because... -the engineer is Lia's ex? -Michelle. Tell me, Lia. Do you plan on getting back with him? -Michelle! -Are you still in love with him? Aren't you going to get married? Unless... For crying out loud, Philip. You are the legacy. You are the prince. You are the future of Cebu! Now you're insecure because of some engineer? Frankly, I don't care about your issues in life. I don't even care about that stupid bridge. But... I have an election to win. Now, let's all get our shit together and make you mayor. Brother, this should have been you. Love, we can still fix this, okay? No, we can't. I know how this would end. Dad will find out, then he'll get mad. And I'll disappoint him again. I'm the son who keeps failing his father. Story of my life. Well, what if we push through with... No. And make you work with your ex? -So? -No. Love... are you jealous? -Me? -You're jealous? Of course, not! I'm way better-looking than him. Of course, you are! And not just that. You're the one I love, not him. Love... you have nothing to worry about, okay? Okay? Now... do you really want to win? -Ms. Lia. -Hi. -I'm sorry I'm late. -Hi. -Is there a problem? -No. -Tintin, are we good? -Yes, sir. The table's ready. -Thank you. -This way, sir. Dude, there's an office emergency. -Okay. -Excuse me. Red suits you. I only came here for one reason. We want you to take on the project. We want the project to succeed but we can only do that if we remain professional. I'm glad this bridge is important to you. -I'm doing this for the people. -For the people? You wanna know why I'm doing this? Because that bridge is where I proposed to the woman I wanted to marry. The woman you cheated on? The one you betrayed when you had sex with another woman in Dubai? -That's why I'm fixing it. -It's already broken. But you still want it fixed, right? Yes, the bridge. That's the only thing you can ever fix. Thank you very much! Okay. Okay, Philip. It's your big day, and you have to focus. I need to focus. Love? Love. Come, let me fix that. I'm ready. Just a bit nervous. Nervous? Don't be. You got this! Don't be nervous, okay? -There. Still nervous? -A little bit. I'm ready! -I'm confident. Let's go! -Come on! Let's all welcome Mayor Ernesto Cordero and family! How are you doing, my beloved Cebuanos? We want to give you what you need. And one of my family's project... is the construction of the broken bridge. We know how difficult it has been after the earthquake. But, with the help of our friends and supporters, I am very proud to say that the bridge is now under construction. Long live, Philip! Thank you very much for your unwavering support. Long live the mayor! Cordero! Cordero! Cordero! Hi. Love, you okay? See, I told you. Looks like your feedback on social media is positive. That's good. Hi, bitch! How are you? I'm good. I'll follow. You look so tired. And you're about to get married. Don't worry, I'll message you my moisturizer. It will do wonders to your face, I promise. I'm sorry, Lia. I just heard from Michelle that exes are invited. I hope you don't mind. I invited Philip's. I'll see you inside. Come. Let's go, Eunice. Love, are you okay? -I am. I'll be back, okay? -Okay. I'll wait for you. Just a second. Congratulations. Thanks, man! I told you, you have my support. You know what? I was wrong about you. What do you mean? At first I thought you came back just to take Lia away. I'm kidding, man. Well, you're not married yet. So it's not too late. Relax, I'm kidding. Hey, Dylan! It's Daddy. You miss me? I miss you. How are you? -Fine. -That's good. Wado, we have to go. We're visiting Randy's dad. Can you call again tomorrow? Hey! What's up, man? Hey, Randy. Heard you guys are gonna visit your dad? Yup. All right, you guys enjoy. I'll see you guys soon. -Looks like you miss Dubai. -Yeah. So, you want to go back? Not yet. It's because of Lia, right? Come on. She's getting married. Tell me, what are you going to do... if the one you love is about to get married and you know she still loves you? Philip is just a rebound, bro. Lia and I were together for four years. Yes, I fucked up. But I know... she still loves me. Lia, have you reviewed the paperwork? Everything is set. We're good to go. Thanks, dude. So... We're all good. Will you be joining us to the site, Miss Marquez? You don't really have to come. I know. But I promised Philip I'll be hands-on with this project. Hands-on? So we'll see each other every day? No. That's why I wanted you to meet Donna. I'll be busy with the wedding preparations. She'll be there in my absence. Yeah, the wedding. Hi, Donna. This is my assistant, Arvin. -Hi. -Exchange contact details. -The service is ready so-- -Let's go. Okay, let's go. -Let me help you. -I'm okay. -You might trip. -I'm okay. I'll be fine. -See? Let me help you. -I said I'll be fine. You're such a show-off. I'm sorry. I just wanted to help. Watch your step. Hey. I want to apologize for what I said earlier. Forget it. -I thought you were mad. -Of course not. You know I can't get mad at you. Actually, I have a lot to thank you for. I've been wanting to say this to you for the longest time, but... You're the reason I became an engineer. Seriously. Remember when I used to think I was really stupid? But you kept telling me... "Babe, you can do it! Babe, Bill Gates didn't get a college degree but he became the richest man on earth." I listened to you, but... I didn't become a Bill Gates. You didn't become Bill Gates but... At least now you can afford a polo. Well, that's because you... You pushed me to chase my dreams. You know, after all this success, I still feel stupid. I'm stupid to have broken your trust. That's okay. That was a long time ago. I know, but you can't stop me from regretting what I did. You know, Lia, the truth is... I miss this. I miss you. Your smile. That look. And your... Your wet underarms. You still haven't changed. Wow! You still have those sweaty armpits until now. -I miss that too. -You're mean! I'm mean? -Why, Isn't it true? Look! -At least I don't smell! Excuse me, I don't smell. I can afford a deodorant now. I missed that. -Are you okay? -Sorry, sorry. -We're running late. -Lia! Lia, just a minute. I'm Philip Cordero. You're Paul, right? My future son-in-law is very handsome. What are you doing here? Do you have a gown for your wedding? Lia, these are my designs. They're nice. -Choose one. -I already have one. You can use it at the reception then. -Choose. -I already have one. -Really. -Want to join us for lunch? Then we can talk about your designs there. You know what? Lia was so imaginative as a kid. Her mom was so amused with her. And her grandma would always tolerate her. I was actually the strict one. But still, every night, she would knock on my door to sleep beside me. Lia... She could only fall asleep in my arms. Remember, Lia? Excuse me. I've to go to the restroom. You know what? He seems okay. Are you sure you don't want him in the wedding? I don't want to talk about it. Please. Love, he's still your father. In New York, people like him are accepted. Exactly. In New York. This is Cebu. I know, but times are changing. People are more accepting. He's just being true to himself. -What he did wasn't easy. -Stop it, please. To be honest, I think he's brave. Would you rather he kept it a secret and stayed miserable the rest of his life? I said enough! You don't know what you're talking about. You don't understand and you never will because it's so fucking complicated. You think he's miserable? Why? Because he's gay? Because people judge him? Is that it? You call that miserable? Bullshit. What about that child he left? The child who worked so hard to fend for herself because he wasn't around? The child who lost her mom. What do you call that? He didn't even come to the funeral. I waited for him but he didn't show up. I cried myself to death... because I felt like I was cursed. I lost both my mother and my father, too. That... That's what's miserable, not him. And now that I'm okay, he wants back in my life? Now that I have a chance at my own family, he comes back like nothing happened? For what? To destroy my life again because I don't have the right to be happy? Is that it? Don't you ever speak to me about pain again, because you don't know pain the way I do. You know nothing. You have no idea how painful it is. -You know nothing. -I'm sorry. Philip! Philip! Philip! Philip! Philip! Lia! Everyone, gather around! Gather around! Congratulations to us! Philip is now leading the latest polls! Yes! Great! Great groundwork from everyone. And that is mainly because of... The bridge! We are claiming it! To the future Mayor Cordero! Wait. Thank you very much to each and every one of you. Because of all of you, I was able to lead the polls, so thank you. Thank you so much, especially to my fiancée, Lia. -Happy birthday. -You guys. Happy birthday to you. I'm so glad we made it. Let's eat! -Happy birthday. -Thank you. -Dude! -Happy birthday. Thank you. -Hey! -Hi. Where's Philip? Well, he's... -He's got... -Let me guess. He's in a meeting? Yes. Meeting. But he'll try to follow. -Let's eat? -Sure. -Have a seat. -Thank you. What? That's your son? He's a big boy now. How old is he? Three next month. -Three? -It's Dylan. Here. Look. He's so cute! -And really handsome, huh? -I know. It's a good thing he didn't take after you. You fell in love with this face before, remember? Did you ever imagine you'd own a company like this? Then there's your cute son. And me, I'm getting married. A lot has changed. A lot has changed, but... I feel there's something missing in my life. Lia, you know, it's not too late. Wado... Lia, please. Lia. -Please, just hear me out. -Wado, not here. Just hear me out. I just wanna apologize, please. Okay. Look, I've always wanted to do this, okay? Just... -Just hear me out. -Okay. Look, Lia. I know I hurt you. God knows how sorry I am for what I did to you. Look. I'm happy I was able to share with you the picture of my son. But, you know, he's a constant reminder of what I did to you and... It's a constant reminder that I've lost you. Look, Lia... Marrying Philip is a big mistake. That's not the life you want. He can't make you happy the way I can. Lia... I love you so much. Okay? I really do love you. Who are you to tell me what to do with my life that you ruined? -I love Philip. -No. And I'll never leave him for someone like you! -Eunice! Hi! -Auntie! -Nice surprise. -Thank you. You look lovely. I always loved your hair. -How's your mom? -She's doing good. Philip went jogging but he'll be back soon. Okay, auntie. -Give your mom my love, okay? -I will. Nice of you to come. Oh, there he is. Perfect timing. Let me leave you two alone. Do you want me to make you some tea? -Yes, please, auntie. Thank you. -Okay. -Make sure he takes a shower. -I will, Mom. What are you doing here? Why is it every time we see each other, you feel like I'm on to something bad? Because you always do. Can't the reason be your mom just missed me? By the way, why didn't I get an invitation to the wedding? 'Cause you're not invited out of respect for Lia, my future wife. In case you forgot. Well... I can just drop by, right? I can do anything I want. Listen to me, Eunice. I've been trying to be nice to you. But if you try to sabotage my wedding, God only knows what I can do to you. Be careful, Philip. I know everything about you. In case you forgot, too. Next time, you're gonna have to pay for staring. I don't want this to sound like a pick up line but I think I've seen you before. Right. At the mayor's press conference. You were there, too. So I'm assuming you know Philip. Honey... I know the soil, the ground, the dirt... the filth. Filth? I thought Philip was a good boy. Seriously, what kind of filth? You now have my attention. Come on, share it. What's your password? -I don't kiss and tell. -Neither do I. I don't kiss and tell that easily. Out of curiosity, what's on your phone? This? Let me see. Come on. Please? -You want this? -Come on. Show me. No. No. So... -What are you doing? -Do you wanna see your prize? Are you just teasing or do you really gonna show me? Maybe. Maybe? Come on. I worked hard for this. Show me. -Please? -Five seconds. Let me see that. Hey, what are you doing? Come on. -Time's up! -Show me, please. Come on! I wanna see it. Please? Don't! No. Philip, we received a tip. I don't know what's going to happen, but Gonzales is planning an attack on you. I don't know what they have on us. But we need to be ready to counter. What do you mean, he knows? I'm so sorry, Philip. I was too drunk. Don't worry. He didn't get a copy of the video. I don't care! He already knows! Son of a bitch, Eunice! Didn't you even think that I'm campaigning? And that I'm getting married? -What if Lia learns about this? -Then good! If Lia can't love you for who you are, then she doesn't deserve you. Me? I can love you more than she can. -Marry me, Philip. -Stop it! Love, I'm home. What time will you finish? -Okay. -Ma'am, I'll take care of it. Okay. I love you. Roger, Philip's almost done with his meeting at the headquarters. You may now pick him up. At the headquarters? He messaged me to pick him up at Ma'am Eunice's condo. -Where? -At Ma'am Eunice's condo. The one near Mandaue. Hi, love. Love. Have you heard about this? There's a rumor that Gonzales has a mistress. He said in an interview that it came from his opponents. Love, do you know anything about this? No. It's the first I've ever heard of it. How was the meeting last night? It was okay. Roger told me... you were with Eunice? Yes, because Eunice... She's... Her family's gonna donate for the campaign. Love! Are you okay? Yeah. You? Are you okay? Let's go. -Hi, Michelle. -Lia. -Do you have a minute? -Yeah. I'm sure you've heard about the rumor on Gonzales. They've been telling the press it came from us. I'm scared that it might affect Philip's standing on the polls. Lia, it's okay. I got this. They don't have evidence that it came from us. Don't worry. I know how to play this. Evidence... Wait! Are you telling me that it really came from us? Yes. Michelle... We want to fight fair and clean. Maybe it doesn't need to get to this. What are you talking about? This was Philip's idea in the first place. Lia... welcome to politics. It's a dog eat dog world. It's either you bite and devour them, or you get chewed and eaten alive. You took advantage of Eunice. Philip, she had a good time herself. You really think that's why I'm here? What do you want? It took me a while to figure you out. I always knew there was something off with you. Now, it's clear. What is this? -Blackmail? -Blackmail? Are you stupid? -You think that's why I'm here? -Then what the hell do you want? The truth, Philip! I want the truth! I want Lia to know the fucking truth. Don't you think she deserves it, after everything she's been through? And what? Do you think that when she finds out the truth, she'll get back with you? -That she'll marry you? -I don't fucking know. I hope so. But do you think she'll be happy to know that her fiancé likes kissing guys just like her father? What? No. I will not tell Lia. Grow some balls. If you're not telling her, I guess we're done here. But one thing's for sure, Philip. Well... I won't let Lia marry a fairy like you. Love... There's something I want to tell you. Is it Eunice? What? Are you back together? -Of course not! -Did she brainwash you? What do you mean? To spread rumors about Gonzales. -No, no! -So what? It's... Yes. Yes? That really was your idea? -Because I want to win! -By playing dirty? Whatever it takes, then yes! I'm sorry. Sorry to disappoint you. Love, I'm sorry if... I wasn't the perfect man you thought I was. I'm not perfect at all. Please... Be patient with me. I'm just going through a lot. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here for you. Lia, have you checked Anton's new designs already? Not yet. I'm still busy with the bridge. What can be more important than what you're going to wear on your wedding day? Why don't you just let Philip and the team handle that? Mom, just in case you forgot, Lia is spearheading the bridge construction. Lia... Do you think it's possible to finish the bridge... in four months? Dad, four months? You gave us six months. I know. But the clock is ticking, Philip. Michelle told me Gonzales is getting ahead in polls. We have to rush the bridge. Dad, four months is impossible! Nothing's impossible, Philip! Lia, Philip, I hope you realize what you're asking from me is impossible. We agreed on a timeline. What happened? Wado, I know it's a lot to ask... but honestly, we don't have a choice. Philip's victory rests on this. And more so, our people need this. Talk about a guilt trip. I'll go back to Manila, talk to some subcontractors. But it's gonna cost you, a lot of money. And it's gonna be hard to convince these people. We'll go with you to Manila to help you convince them. -You're coming to Manila? -Love, it's... We have meetings and the campaign-- Love, we need this. -We're going with you to Manila. -You're the boss. -Lia! -Hi! Hi, Lia! -Excuse me. -Go ahead. -How are you? -Hi, Philip! This is gonna be fun, Mayor. Will you tell her the truth in Manila? Get your hand off me. -Answer me first. -I said get your hand off me. Why? You like this, don't you? Remove my hand then. You like this, right? Relax, mayor. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Michelle. -Hi. -Lia Marquez? Yeah, we're checking in. Okay. We'll just settle in and I'll fix all that. Did you see that, mayor? They're out in the open. Don't you want that kind of freedom? When are you telling Lia? You know what? I wonder if you really want Lia to know. Why not tell her yourself? Fine. Wait! I'll do it. Just give me time. Thank you. So as you can see, Mr. Ramos, the project's almost done. But given the new timeline by Mr. Cordero, I don't think we can finish on time unless... Unless we obtain your help. The project seems feasible, Mr. Dela Costa. But I'd like to hear from Mr. Cordero. What are your plans after this? I mean, after the elections. Are you all right, Mr. Cordero? I'm sorry, Mr. Ramos. Did you say after the elections? Yes. What happens next? After I win the elections and... after the bridge is finished, we definitely have more plans to build more infrastructure for our fellow Cebuanos in the future. And with this partnership, then hopefully, we could do more projects together in the future. Thank you. The reason I asked is because we have to consider the business climate that you hope to create for Cebu. And I think I like what I'm hearing. I think we can work this out. You can trust Philip. He's a man of his word, right? -Thank you. -Thank you, ma'am. I hope you're happy. They took on the project. That's a fancy ring. It's much nicer than the one I gave you. Do you know it's still with me? Lia, if I didn't hurt you before... do you think we'd be married now? -With a family? -I don't know. And I don't think about that because I'm getting married. That's just it. Do you really know who this guy is? Wado, leave us alone. Whether you like it or not, we're getting married. But what if-- Let's go. -Has Mr. Ramos called yet? -Not yet. I'll just drop the invite off at my aunt's house. -Don’t you need me with you? -Love, there's no need. I ordered food for you. -Bye! -I'm taking a shower. -You know, the shower. -No, love. -Bye! -I'll wait for you, okay? Thank you. Sorry, ma'am. Here's your new keycard. -Thanks! -Hi. -Hi. -Ma'am, I'm here. -Going somewhere? -Are you the driver? Take this. I'm bringing the invitation to my aunt's place. -I'll go ahead. -Just you? Yes. I think I left my wallet. Can we go back? Love... -Excuse me, miss. -Yes, ma'am? Did I leave my wallet here? Sorry, ma'am, but I didn't notice. I lost my keycard. Can I just get another one? -Okay. -Room 204. -Get out! -What? What are you gonna do? What? Don't dare fight back! When will you tell her? -Tell her that you're gay. -Give me time! Why do you think I'm doing this? Do you see that? Do you want her to see this? You want evidence? You faggot. Don't force me to put this out. If you don't tell Lia the truth, I'll put this out. Give me that. Love? Have you seen my wallet? Love? Love! -What happened to you? -I slipped. What happened? I'm okay. Come, stand up. -Good morning, sir. -Hi, good morning. I'd like to check out. Room 404. It's been settled, sir. Mr. Cordero has checked out as well. -When? -Around 4 a.m., sir. Thank you. Why don't we just leave this place? Let's live somewhere else. Love... What's happening to you? You've been like that since yesterday. I'm tired. So tired. I don't want this anymore. This isn't the life I wanted. All I wanted... was to marry you. To have a family with you. To live in peace. Love, you're all that matters to me. Don't leave me. Whatever happens, please don't leave me. Love, listen. Let's just finish this party then let's just go home early tonight. And then let's talk about this later. Okay? Okay? Okay. Congratulations, guys. And thanks to the future Mr. and Mrs. Cordero for closing the deal. Because of that, our bridge will soon be passable, so guys, cheers! -Cheers! -Clink your glasses. Cheers! Cheers! Philip, Lia, long time no see. Philip Cordero, honest and truthful. We're here to celebrate the construction of our bridge. Did you know Mr. Cordero even accompanied me to Manila? Just so we could close the deal with the people involved in the bridge's construction. He hasn't won yet and he's already doing the job. Honest and truthful. I hope you could be that honest and truthful to everyone, Philip. Most especially to the person beside you. Cheers! -Philip! Cheers! -That's enough. -Dude. -Philip! Just one shot. You fag. Are you gay? You must be gay. Come on, are you gay? -Hey, just relax, okay? -Son of a bitch, come on! -Come on. -Wait. Clarisse, where's Michelle? -Honest and truthful, Mayor. -What's that? -Congratulations again. -Arvin? Arvin, where's Philip? Where is he? You asshole! You son of a bitch! Come on! I'll kill you, motherfucker! Philip! Stop! That's enough! -Are you crazy? -Stop it! Stop! Go on, get out of here. -Stop this now! -You asshole! -Hey! Hey! -Guard! Guard! Enough! -That's enough, get out of here! -You fucking faggot! -I'm gonna kill you! -Get out of here! Get out! Hey, you faggot! Admit it! Tell her or I'll kill you! -Who cares? Come on! -Get out! -I'll kill you! Faggot! -Go ahead! I will kill you! Tell the truth! He's gay, Lia! Lia... Lia! Lia. Who are you? This is still me. Which one? The guy who almost killed a man or the one who kissed my ex? Lia, let me explain. Explain yourself because I don't understand anything. Who are you? What's the truth? Yes, I've been with men and women in my past. I couldn't tell you, but that's the truth. Since when? What the hell? Since when? Why didn't you--? -Why didn't you tell me? -Calm down. -Lia, calm down, okay? -What? Calm down? You want me to calm down? How do you expect me to do that? My father's transgender, my fiancé's bisexual! I might as well complete the letters to LGBT! How the hell will I calm down? How--? The video, what was that? Was that real? Lia, no! He was blackmailing me. Blackmail? It makes no sense! You were in the shower together! Lia, he set me up because he wants to get you back. If you're fighting over me, you should've invited me so we could all shower together, and everyone's happy! Why were you kissing? He kissed me so he could set me up. And you enjoyed it? Did it turn you on? -No! -Do I turn you on? Yes! Yes! I make love to you because I love you. You're a liar! You don't love me! You played me for a fool! You're a fraud! You're a liar! You deceived me! You don't love me! You made a fool out of me. You know what I've been through. Fucking hell! I gave you everything. I gave up my life for you! I loved you with all I could give. I loved you with all I could give. Lia, I'm sorry but I can't change who I am. It doesn't change the fact that I love you, okay? I'm sorry. Don't insult me by making this about your sexuality because this is not about that. Not even for my father. This is about you lying to me. You betrayed me. All of you. You're all the same. You all betrayed me. You're all the same. You're all the same. How could you betray me like this? Lia... Fuck, fuck, fuck. You're withdrawing from the elections? Then you're calling off the wedding? What the hell are you thinking? Ernesto, please, calm down. Do you see... the shame your son is giving us? I'm sorry. Sorry for what? For being a failure? Or sorry for being a fucking faggot? Ernesto! I'm sorry for having you as my father! -Philip! -What did you say? -You son of a bitch! -Ernesto, please... Yes! I am a son of a bitch! You want to hurt me? Do it! -No, no, no! -Do it! Beat me all you want but you don't own me! You're such a disappointment! I'd rather be a disappointment than live a life trying to please you. All my life, I've looked up to you. I idolized and respected you. I loved you. But me? Did you ever see me as your son? I guess not. I guess not. Philip... Philip, wait... We already lost a son, Ernesto. And now you're willing to lose another? Is this what you want? For you to lose all of us? To lose your family? Aren't we the real disappointment in this family? Lia, I just wanna talk to you. I just need to talk to you. Where's Lia? I want to talk to her. Sir... -Lia! -Sir, please don't make a scene. Lia! Grandma... Grandma, call Lia out. I just wanna talk to her. Come back when you're sober. Please. I just really need to... Please. Lia... Lia, please, can we talk? Wait, just hear me out, okay? I promise, I won't bother you again. Just let me talk to you. Please? Lia, I thought I could prove... my love to you by doing the things I did. I was wrong. I ended up hurting you. I realized that the only way I can prove to you that I truly love you is by setting you free. But it's so hard to do. But I know I have to do it. For you to be happy. I know it's the right thing to do. I never intended to hurt you, okay? I just loved you. Maybe a little too much. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. This year would've been... my 50th wedding anniversary with your grandfather. Here's to you, my Juancho! Cheers! So... Are you going to talk to him? For what? I'm not asking you to get back with him. All I'm saying is... face him. Grandma, let's not talk about it. Cheers! Lia... Let me tell you this. If you don't face it now, it's just going to happen to you again. That I'm sure of. It will haunt you to remind you of the things you can't confront. That's how it is. You'll get hurt. You'll get devastated. But don't run away from it, Lia. Face it. Face it. Come, I brought you some snacks. Try them. We have rice cake. I'm good. Come on. Have a bite. You came a long way. It's good you didn't lose your way. I asked grandma how to get here. Dear... I'm sorry for what happened to you and Philip. So the wedding's no longer happening? No. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you also feel sorry when you left me and Mom? Dear... They say that... I should not apologize for who I am. But whenever I realize that the price... of embracing my identity, is losing the person I love the most, I get angry. I question God... why I had to be like this. Why I couldn't stay the father you knew? The father you came home to from school. The father you'd cry to whenever you came home scraped and bruised. The father-- The father you won't be ashamed of. Dear... every day, I would tell myself, "You have to fight... for Lia." How unfair! It was unfair that I had to choose... between who I am and who I Iove. But you still didn't choose me. I realized... that for me to truly love you, I had to be true to myself first. Believe me, not a day has passed... that I didn't think of coming back to you. I went to your house every day, begging your mom to talk to you, be with you, hug you, but... I had to accept that... it was the price I had to pay... for choosing to be true to myself. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lia. I'm sorry. Dad. Dad. Stop crying. Dad... I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know anymore. You know what to do, Lia. You know. Philip and I are different. But what's important is... we all have the freedom to choose... who to love. Are you really sure you won't run anymore? I'm not. I'm sorry again. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Yes, I got scared. I was afraid you'd leave me. But I love you so much and trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you again. Love... Love, no, no. No, you can keep the ring. Please, wear the ring. Love, please, please. I know I don't deserve a second chance, I know I'm not worthy after everything I've done. But please... Just please, I beg you. Just take the ring and wear it. Love, please. Love, please... Please take this ring. Philip, get up, please. Please. I've dreamed of you since we were kids. And after everything that happened in my life, after all the people that came and went, when I saw you again... Love, nothing changed. I still love you. That's why I'm certain... Love, I'm certain, I am sure that I could commit myself to you. I need time. All my life I did nothing but care for other people. So that they would love me. I did it with Wado, I did it with you. Maybe because... I wanted you to fill the gap my father left. But every time I give... I end up with nothing left for myself. I end up giving everything. This time, I want to focus on myself. I owe myself that. I need to come to the point where... despite the so many questions I have, despite of all my fears... I can believe you. I can accept you. I can choose you without any other reason but my love for you. But I can't do it right now. Not yet. No matter how long it takes... I will wait for you to choose me. I will wait for you to choose me, love. No matter how long it takes, I will wait for you. -Lia? -Hi. Nice to see you here. Is Michelle your friend? I like how everything looks. They have a beautiful setup. Long time no see. I didn't know I'd see you here. May I please ask you to please assemble outside for the procession now? Okay, see you. You love me even when it's difficult to love me. You stayed... even if there was no reason to stay anymore. I know that there are so many uncertainties in our future, but the certainty of our love... it makes me brave to face tomorrow. That's why I wanna take this moment to say that I love you. I love you so much. I really do. And I promise you... You'll get the love that you also deserve. We've gone through a lot. We've gone through many trials. But I'm so glad those trials happened because they proved that I love you even more. And now, I know... marriage is not just this one day big event, but it is a choice that you make every single day. I choose to marry you. I choose... being married to you. Through the darkest times without conditions... without knowing what the future holds. -Kiss! -Kiss! Here comes the magical kiss. More! I was praying that you'd come today. But I'm so happy you did. Can you join me at the reception? I missed you. I missed you more.
