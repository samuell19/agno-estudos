Shit. It's closed! Well, it's so green… Why didn't you check beforehand? From where? Aren't museums supposed to be open year round? Look at the sign. It won't open anytime soon. What should we do now? Let's try the walking trail around the back. Yeah, we already came all the way here. - Too bad it's closed! - Nice weather though. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Where did the railway go? Myanmar. It's on the sign. Did they finish building it? Maybe someone comes out to build it. Oh, shit. Sorry. I should have worn sneakers instead. Here are the railway sleepers. That's all there's left. Hey, where are you going? To look at the view. Come check this out. It's so beautiful here. Yes, beautiful. Jay, right there. Ready? Hurry up. There is this piece… A piece of the screen that we didn't use. - It's still under here. - Don't forget to pack it up. - Put everything on one side. - Yeah, do that. Could you try this way? Let this go first. A rivet. Find some bag to put this in. Screen package? - What? - What's the screen package? The screen came in a plastic bag. That bag. - The one with all the screws here? - No, it's a red bag. It's a different one. Just find a new bag for it. - We need to unscrew it. - No, just pull it out. You're ex-military? Let me see. Did you have a lot of experiences? - Lived in the jungle. - No, hardly! Ever been in combat? We need to flip this one over. Take off the bases. Pull it. Are they really going to close the zoo? Yes, they're moving all the animals out now. Seems they're closing it down. There's no place for the animals. Guess he didn't get vaccinated. That was good. Why didn't you audition for the role of Kimchi? Yeah, you might get it. - I really wanted to play that dog. - Why? You know, I still feel so bad for Nim. How could Jay just leave her like that? But that's normal, isn't it? Hey, aren't you going to say something? Well, see, if you were dating someone and… Wait. What was I saying? If you were with someone who you didn't love anymore, then what would you do? I'd leave her, of course. You see? But I'd tell her that before leaving. Take this. I'd tell her first. What would you say? Perhaps that I'm going to the zoo! And then just leave! Probably with the rhino! And just disappear. I almost choked. If it was me, I would say… My dear Sorn… What, "my dear Sorn"? I have something to tell you. Spicy. So spicy. Good? Enough. Your throat is all sore. Gosh, that was tiring. You'd really do that? Yes, it's better than not saying anything. Friends. Love is like an illness. What are you doing now? It's out. Love makes you blind. Unable to hear or see the obstacles in front of us. I gotta take a leak. Love is like a tough bull. Fuck. A tough bull struggling to get free from the cage. Why would a tough bull let anyone cage it? The bull charging ahead. It wouldn't stay… It wouldn't… stay in the cage. Sweet dreams. The air here is much better than in Bangkok. I'm sorry about your turtle. What's that? A song. - That's a song? - Yes, it is. Did you just make it up? No, it's a real song. It's from the 80's or something. My dad always loved to play it on road trips. You came to Kanchanaburi a lot? No, my dad just played it wherever we went. Everywhere, it always goes, "O Kanchanaburi". No shit? But they sing it better, right? Yes, they sang it better indeed. Otherwise the song wouldn't be released. How long will you continue doing theater? I will probably keep on doing it as long as it still makes sense to me. Why? Nothing. I just can't imagine myself still doing this at 40. I want something more stable. I thought about going back to school. - What are you going to study? - Marketing. Marketing? This side is more exciting. This one too. The air here is much better than in Bangkok. Yeah. I'm sorry about your turtle. Yeah. I'd rather die If I don't get to be with you What's that? It's a song from the 80's. My dad always played it on road trips. - That's a real song? - Yes, it is. How long will you continue doing theater? Until I couldn't do it anymore. What about you? I don't know. But I can't imagine myself still doing plays at 40. I want something more stable. I want to go back to school. What will you study? Marketing. Marketing? - Hippo. I don't know. - Where's the hippo? Car. Car's coming. I want to take a photo. Wait. Just wait. Let them take the photo first. Just a second.
