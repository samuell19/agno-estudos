WHY NOT! Louis, lunch is ready. No, I must finish this wood. Later? To be like a princess a woman must be rich. How could Pauline sell to me those nights that are the price of life? We seldom die for such girls I never could destroy... It's after 6, I'm leaving Madam. Yes, I will see you on Monday. You will go on where you left off? That' s right. - Your envelope is on the table. - Thank you Madam. Pick those up. Yes. Cut any wood? A little. Where is Louis? He's asleep. You alright? I always read the same thing. She sleeps... but she pays. Is your room getting on? Yeah. Oh, shit! This lousy bike, it's not true! Goddam! This stupid machine! Your feet are frozen, warm them. That's nice. The room will be ready in 2 days. Can't I see it now? No, I'll show you when it's finished. Did you make them beds? Yeah... one each. Will she agree? Shit, I've run out of gasoline. I pedaled 3 miles to get back. Poor guy. Didn't I have a reserve can somewhere? Quick... - I'll be late. - Yes, behind the coal. Thanks, I'm off. Your cap. Were you very late? The boss shouted a bit. Your hands are cold... warm them... Is any one home? Any one home? Come in, it's open. Afternoon, Sir. It's about the enquiry. Inspector Brical. Really. - You didn't know? - No. It's to confirm your testimony. I don't know about... You are Fernand Bulat? Yes. You did witness the accident? I don't think so, no. But it is written on this form. Well, I'll see the chief about it. Thanks, goodbye Sir. I swear it's in good condition, needs one part and it will be like new. - How much? - $200, a bargain. Where's the money from the club? Fernand paid the rent. I can't give it to you. Nothing aside? Shit, I'll lose this amp. Ask Fernand. This is just impossible. I... I... I can't take it. I don't mind emptying the garbage. But when you undo all I've done. Louis, you've run the bath over 3 times and the fuses... So if you can't cope with electricity. Just tell me and I'll do your repairs. It's just impossible! Alex, you spill your coffee, wipe it up! This house is just a garbage dump. I have had enough. I made you each a shelf in the bedroom, at least use them. Not even fold them, just put thins back. What does this room look like? It's a real mess! You ruin all I do. I've had it. No, it belongs to Alex. It doesn't go there, let me do it. Say, I've found an amp. It's really great. $200. Really first class stuff. Needs one spare part and it's good as new. But I put in the spare part. Take the money in my jacket. Fernand! What is that? A surprise for you. - What is it? - Open, you'll see... Gentleman, Madam. Inspector Brical. Mr. Fernand Bulat? He's out. Oh, I see. When will he be back? In an hour or so. It's about the... enquiry, you know about it? What enquiry? - He didn't tell you? - No. - You do live here? - Yes. - You don't know? - No. Listen, I don't get it. I'll call again. - What does he want? - A pain in the neck. Punch him up. He's not mean. There he is. Just be quick, tell me what you want. - They there? - Yes. Can't you go out alone? What is it? Come back and I'll forgive you. A scandal, workin all day to feed those guys. Come back, you won't have to work. You made mother fall sick, it's shameful. We said you were away, no one knows. Come back, it will be as it was. What really goes on? You get turned on watching them screw? It is desertion, if we divorce you're in the wrong. F... yourself. Let's go. Come on, I'll take you to eat at the club. Thanks, I'd rather stay with Fernand. I look awful. Don't worry about your husband. No... You know I love you. Yeah. You don't give a damn about that guy , so ... I don't give a damn. Well, you do and you don't. Go on, you'll be late. I am always late. I don't care. I adore you! - Fernand, may I come in. - Yeah. - Finished? - Almost, look. I've still some thins to do, I want to make white satin pillows. - Isn't it going to be cute? - Yes... Why did you put black drapes? It's the only material I had, I like it. Yes. What's that? I stole them in a cemetery, aren't they funny. - You don't like it. - I do. But, it's not very sunny for a kid's room. Well, I like it. - Don't get mad. - You're a pain in the neck. - It's mine, I do as I like. - Right. But you said it's not good for kids. No, I just said that you've worked for months, told us that at last you'd have your kids. Yes, I can have them here now. - Cool it. - You cool it! They'll come, and love this room. Open your eyes, this is not a kids' room. It is a two-berth coffin. - Look at it. - At what? They will never come here. Now get out. Just get out! It's a rave, it's shit, fine! Get out! From now on, I forbid you to even put a foot inside, and Louis too. You're so dumb. OK, beat me up like Roger, two in a day. You dumb fool! Asshole, imbecile! Keep your damn room! You will pay me to look at it. This room is ugly, ugly, ugly! I don't want to see your kids, I don't care. They must be as dumb as you. Fernand... I know they will never come. Give me that ball... Hurry up for God's sake. What do I wear, you didn't wash my sweater. Yes I did, look for it. - Louis, get moving. - Just a minute. Here it is. Help yourself to cake, Mr. Louis. Please help yourself, Miss... No thank you. - What? - No thank you, that's fine. Are you all well? Very well. - What? - Speak louder. Very well. Isn't it hot? It is only June. We are in for a hot summer. The house? As charming as ever. Here is the rent. Very good, here is the receipt. I don't quite understand if you and Miss Alex are married. Really? Or is she married to Mr. Louis? Well, as long as it works... ...the voice of death, lost in troubled meditation where one thought reigned. He crossed the Tuileries to reach the Pent Royal, stopping at the top of the bridge, he looked down to the depths of the Seine. We've finished the book. What shall we read now? Start at the beginning again, as usual. At the end of last October, shortly after the gambling saloons open the law protecting this taxable passion, the law that first takes your hat... I've had my fill of this book. Is it a biblical parable... I could read the directory. Is it not rather a way of signing a devilish contract... But why must I always read the same book? ...but what pledge if only to force you to behave... Keep going kid, payday is getting near. Mr. Fernand Bulat? Let's start over again. Start what? You deny it? Deny what? Were you there on the 24th? Yes. Where? At the crash. There was a crash? Listen, this is... complicated enough, don't make it worse. Alright.. You are Fernand Bulat? Yes. - 3 children? - No. Two? Yes. - Robert and Charles Bulat. - No. Forgive me, a boy and a girl, Sylvie and Ludovic. No! Back to first base. Alright. Listen, I've had it. They give me forms that are never right. I tell my chief, the forms are wrong. He says o and check with so-and-so. If I knew what I was investigating. I can't go on like this. I'm telling you... It's never the right one. Would you like a coffee? Yes, thank you. How is she? It won't be long, I can't leave her in hospital. I wanted to tell you... - I wanted to tell you that... - Yes. It's not my fault, she was like that before we met. I mean, it's not your fault either. You should get married, give concerts. Louis, don't become like her. You are the same. I was alone. Alone. What do you mean? Tell me. The same. Exactly the same. One out of two. Look. There's Louis. Come here. Come, Fernand. Unless he's married to Miss Alex... I invented a new method of mental arithmetic. Take, say, 2328 multiplied by 28... Instead of sayin 6 times 7... - No, 8 times 7, what was it? - 28. - The other... - Can't remember. Say it was 8. Instead of 8 times 8, I count together the tens and units, - which means that I say 8 times... - 8 times 30. That's it, 8 times 30 plus 8 which gives us, 8 x 8 = 56, no, 64, plus... 8 times 3... 18, no, 24. That means 180 plus 56, which is 246. - No, 236, get it? - Yeah. Then I put aside that figure. - What was it? - Yes... Yes, that's it, 236. Then I take the hundreds and thousands. So it is always 8 multiplied by... Then I take the figure we put aside. Really. What did I say? 2328 multiplied by... 40. - The other one. - 15. No, the one ending in 8. - 58. - No. 38. - 18. - No! - 28. - That's it. We had 265, right? So, 2328 multiplied by 265... No, 28. No, 15. Wait a minute. Any way, it's a new method I invented. It's great. - But boring. - Not at all. What are you doing? Mind your own business. You can't do that, his engine will be ruined. I said mind your own business. - Call the cops if you like. - Why the cops... Get out of here, leave me alone. You could be polite. Polite? You want my fist in your face? - She's crazy. - Lousy creep. What? A creep? Now... Just get off my back. Shit, did I ask for your help? I know what I'm doing. You don't care about what that guy did to me. - I do care. - No, you don't. Yes... If you knew, you'd fill it up with truckloads of sand. - Maybe. - No sir, not maybe. But for that you need guts. - Guts? - That's it, you're gutless. - She's nuts... - You are all gutless. - Shall I prove that I'm not? - You are. - You want me to prove it? - Gutless. You asked for it. Gutless yourself. I'll show you, I've got at least 4lbs here. Who's that? No one, I don't know him. What is that in your sweater? Nothing, a little sand. What for? Nothing. I like making sand castles. - Can we meet? - No, I'm busy. Where you going? No scenes, you bore me. - To see her? - Yes, I'm going to see her. Paul... OK, bye. What's this. My tank is open. Police! You bastards! What a mess, for God's sake. That car must be worth at least $21,000. Stay with me, he'll kill me. Bastards, a brand new car. You in love with him? Well, I don't know... The bastards! I'll have the cops up your ass... - Your barman? Left him? - Yeah. - He was great. - He really turned me on. Well? In great shape dancin, but at home nothin. I said, don't worry, if it doesn't come, we'll go see a movie. He had to prove he could. I told him to just let it happen. I was OK even if we did nothin. He kept tryin, he was in a state. I had enough, so I left. - Where's Fernand? - Don't know. We've got to get out of here. - Really? Why? - I'll explain, hurry up! - Where were you last night? - Behind some garbage cans. You drive, I've had enough. He looked for words to express the desire, but from his throat came strangled sounds, each breathe seemed to come from his guts. Unable to utter a sound, he bit Pauline, her eyes were dry. It's ten past six, I'm going. Madam, I'm leavin. The old woman died. She just up and died while I was reading. DO NOT ENTER THIS ROOM IN MY ABSENCE - FERNAND What happened? Where's Fernand? What's wrong with this goddam vacuum cleaner! Will it work, or won't it, dammit! I'll have to find another job. These things are junk. They always break down. Excuse me, I'm really not in the mood. Neither am I. Is Bulat in? Has this been going on for long? I wonder what happened. - You were too rough. - Too rough! - Maybe you were too hard. - So you were tough? No, it's broken down before. I don't understand. Did you check the ventilator? Yes... look... Over there, on the steps. Take a look yourself, it is in order. Nothin out of place there, I don't get it. We checked everything. Can you put all that back together? Don't worry, that is not the most difficult. Takes 15 minutes. First we must find what is wrong. Goodbye. When he gets back we'll ask him to call. They are all in the back. Take them to the police station. There's a lady asking for The Bridge on the River Kwai. The what? Bridge on the River Kwai. - Show her to me. - The one with glasses, near the bar. Tell her to fuck herself. He knows the son well, but it reminds him of his wife who died in Indochina. Forgive him, but he just can't play that tune. Poor man! No use waitin like that, he won't come quicker. Then why have you been watchin from up there for 2 hours? Because you snitched the best place. I heard a car. Did you? Let's go and see. - Is it him? - Who else at this time? - Those are my jeans. - Never mind. When will you put this junk back together? Bye baby, forget about me... - I've been searching for hours. - Oh, really. I thought you could ride. Well you see... I can't. He won't come back after ten days. Yes, he will. Maybe he's in trouble. No, he's in Cabourg with that girl, Sylvie, or with his kids. If he comes back, I'll tell him... Leave him alone, he's free to go off. I'll show you what I'll do to his room. Don't even dream about going near it. - Really... - He is a decorator, he fixed a house near Paris. - Right, Fernand? - Oh, a small house. He is so modest. That's so charming, I love artists. Before he was a worker, he's an ex-worker. Manual labor is a form of art. You were a craftsman? No, on the line in a canning plant. Really. His friend is a great jazz pianist. Can I get his records? He's a beginner, when he makes a record I'll tell you. That's very kind. He invented a new method of mental arithmetic. How interesting! Mental arithmetic! I, too, sometimes read scientific magazines. All those fascinating thins one doesn't know. Yes, it is... Tell mother how you got lost riding, so you walked and I finally found you. Well, I got lost riding, so I walked and Sylvie found me. Poor man, it must have been awful. You go. I can't... I'm going home. Don't wait up for me, I won't be home. Where are you going? I am of no use to you. She left this for him, I don't know what it is. MY LOUIS HIS HAIR AT THE AGE OF 3 He isn't back. No... I didn't come for that, it was a mistake. It wasn't him. I came to chat. Oh, I see. Nice day. Yes. You see, my wife left me this morning. Mine too. I thought she was your friend's wife. So did he. What? It doesn't matter. She packed her has and left, this mornin. I was still in bed, I couldn't stop her. She said: "Egg face", and that's all. In 20 years not a word out of place. Do you know why she left you? It's true, you do have an egg face. You think so? But it doesn't matter. I just don't get it. Shall I teach you to play ping-pong? What is it? Are you comin back? - Can you lend me $100? - What happened? Can I sleep here tonight, I need you. It's inconvenient, I've an important collegaue. A problem? No, Alex has just come home. You can finally meet her at last. Just say hello, then I'll ive you the money. Mr. and Mrs. Fabbri, Alex, my wife. How do you do? - Honey, a drink? - No thank you. - Are you changing? - Not just yet. Your wife is... Well, sometimes I... She's an artist, we're expecting a child. That's wonderful. - How is your son? - Well... Fine, he's going to big school. Very advanced, he reads, counts. Nicole makes him work, nowadays you can't afford to fail school. I myself studied a lot, and it helped me. - Still got the Alfa? - Yes. It's handy for going to the office now that we live in the country. Nicole has the 204 for shopping. I bought a really nice sailing boat, so we sail on weekends. When will you be director? Within two or three months. Enough of me! Darling? I'll be back... Excuse me a moment. - How much? - Forget it. - You can't go! - I'll come later. No, stay until they go. I can't. Please, what will I say if you go? I'll ive you $200, stay this once. I love you, do you realize how important that man is? Let me go. Why does this have to happen to me? I must go, I can't take this. Don't fix anything fancy for us, something light will do. Is that her? Yes. You comin back? Alex has left. - When? - 6 days as. - Where is she? - I don't know. - They couldn't come. - What? They couldn't come, but they send their regards. I must talk to Mr. Fernand about the real estate man. Really. They want to buy the house, I'll know next month. I will tell Fernand, he'll come to see you. What? - No one in? - I don't know. Come and help with the bags. - Is Alex back? - No. - What is that? - The vacuum cleaner. What happened to it? Nothing serious, small repair job. - It's in pieces. - I had to take it apart. I don't believe it, my vacuum cleaner. Are you mad? You should have put it back together, it's ruined. I've had it with the lot of you. I go away for 5 minutes and you ruin the place. So you are back for good? We didn't touch your room. On a visit or back for good? - Is it your business? - No need to shout like that. Idiot! If you came home to yell, leave. - As you like. - Right, Get the hell out of here. I brought Sylvie, can she stay? Of course. But does Louis agree? He doesn't care, if we are both here. His mother died. I know. Found a job? No... not yet... Did you look? Not really. Then how do you expect to eat? I paid the rent, you must see Mrs. Picaud... What for? Will you tell Sylvie about us? Yes, of course... I'm going to tell her. You could have told us where you were. Did you see my vacuum cleaner? Could you list the parts you brought, so that I can write them down. You really don't want to buy a new one? Excuse me, please. - What is it? - It's about Sylvie. I am her mother, hello. She's out, I don't know when she'll be back. Can I wait for her here? Please do. - What time is it? - Noon. Shall we have lunch? I brought some cakes. No thanks, I'll be late, I have an appointment. Goodbye. Good mornin. Are they home? I don't think so. When will they be back? I am waiting for them too. May I wait for them with you? I brought some cold meats for lunch. - ...that's why I came. - A worry, kids. - Yours... - I have none. She is young. If he intends to marry her, it doesn't matter. I see. We are ready to help them at first. An artist... Marriage is very important. Are you married? I'm being indiscreet. Not at all. Yes, I am married. That is to say my wife has gone. - Has she? - Yes. Because of her work? No, she has one for good. What I mean is, she said "egg face". She doesn't intend to return. - She left you? - Yes. - Poor man. Recently? - 3 days as. My God! She's bound to return. I don't think so, there must be someone else. - That is terribly sad. - Yes. It must be awful to live alone. It is! Such things shouldn't be allowed. I think a woman who decides to marry should be faithful for ever. I am very faithful. It's the greatest proof of love, especially for a man. What joy a united family. Self-control is important. That's what I say. When I think of Sylvie, I'm worried. What does this boy intend to do? Suppose he just leaves her. Imagine waking up alone. I can. l am going to talk to him. She left some clothes. When I get home at night, I hope she'll be in the kitchen, but... if he's not serious, he'll hear about it, her father will come. Her smell liners in the closets. It's all very fine, but one must face responsibility. Do you think I have an egg face? Don't cry, she will certainly come back. Please don't cry, everything will be alright. No, you haven't an egg face. I think you're very nice. - Really? - Yes, but don't cry. - It upsets me to see you cry. - You're kind. Perhaps a little overcooked? Chocolate! A big slice. Your cake is so good. He's great for desserts. Because Alex is so greedy. He learnt the recipes for me. Will you make me a floating island? - His cream pies! - No, stop it! I must go. Me too, I must catch the train. Well, I must be going too. Goodbye. It was nice to meet you. Yes, it was, I mean it. I'll show you our room before you go. It is pretty. Everything is fine, don't worry. He is very serious. We'll live like this, and then get married. Very well... We are in love, it is for ever. The others? We get on, they sleep downstairs, it's OK. It is all perfect, darling. I must be going. One day they will have to leave, if I have children or something... Yes, children. There is no hurry. Have fun first. Move over, you take all the room. I'll spit on you. Go on, spit. Fatter. You're lovely. You got thinner. I am through... Excuse me, I didn't see you. There is no lock. - What is that? - Haddock... It must soak for at least an hour. A waste of time, it tastes the same. I think it's better. Sweetheart, go outside and let me do it. - Is that all? - It is plenty. But we are four. They eat with us? Of course. Are you sad? Not at all. Say, Fernand. Do they eat fruit cocktail... Shall I peel it all? Yes, I will do it. Louis could help us. Listen, I take care of the kitchen. This afternoon, you o job-hunting with Alex. As you say, love. I don't know what Alex is up to. Two weeks and nothin works out. We must find somethin by tomorrow. Alright. - Well? - No good, I'm not serious enough. - I'll go, what sort of guy? - Likes tidiness. Button that, I'll fix it. You have beautiful hair. I love it to be combed... Play it smart and elegant. - Am I alright? - Beautiful. Well? Bluffed my way, spoke English, but no references. Dammit. We must find somethin by tomorrow. Don't worry, we will find somethin. I know a good cake shop near here. Nothing. Never mind, we'll find something. Pick those up before eating. Yes. Why make their beds, they can care for themselves. If they like this mess... A letter for you. "We must inform you that a fire in our warehouse "destroyed the vacuum cleaner in our care. "Our insurance company is estimating the value of your loss..." Mother, look at this toy. Drop it, it's filthy, you'll mess yourself. No, I want it. Drop it, it's dirty, throw it in the utter. Go away or I'll bust your balls. You stinking fag! I bought you some flowers. Really. Thanks. What? Do what? Oh, read to her. Well, I'll think about it. - Well? - No good. Reading to an old dame, I had 2 years of it. I can do that. You really want to? What I really want is to stay at home with Fernand. If that's what you want, do it. And you? I earn the money, I don't like housework. - What is it? - Nothin. - Sylvie? - Upstairs, washing. Really? And our stuff? Here, Fernand forgot our things. - What things? - Alex' and mine. Louis expects me to wash their things. Don't worry, I'll do it. - But why? - Listen to me. It's the way we arranged it. I don't get it. No matter, I'll explain. I love you. Isn't that good? Guys can't do that. They always hurt. Maybe Louis could do it. He is gentle, isn't he. Fernand wouldn't know. Let's organize a competition. But I think Fernand knows. Have you lived together for long? I mean in this house? Ask Fernand. Softer and now louder... Now child, louder. Careful with the fifth... the trill. I will cut it, that finger! Mummy will be cross. The trill, the trill, down on that note! Hit it, for God's sake... Enough, Louis. It's not over, we must go on, if not you'll see. - Stop it! - Why stop him, it's so funny. Shut up, I know what to do. He's sick. You're out of your mind. You shut up too. - But what... - Don't you talk to her that way. Just look after your ass. Don't argue... - Want a fight? - I'd love it. Bastard, help me instead of yelling. The concert was your idea. This happens every time. - He did it for Sylvie. - Why not say no? Why didn't you? I thought he was happy. I told you to shut up. Talk once more to her like that and I go... now. Either you get rid of her, or she stays and you don't treat her like a do, dammit. What did she do? If you've things to explain... Explain what? Why don't you explain? I won't take lessons from you. Why not? 3 weeks without a job, so shut up! We'll find something. You try job-hunting. I do what I have to do. What is that? What you stop me from doing. I'm fed up with you always doing my job. What have I done? Talk to her, instead of runnin away. How are we going to pay the rent? Goin to whore with your husband? Listen, it's not worth paying the rent because Mrs. Picaud is selling. What? Deaf? We are thrown out, poor schmuck. When did you hear? Sometime ago. You didn't tell me. - You had to be here for that. - I was. You were busy elsewhere. Mrs. Picaud, you can't do this... But I am bored, here all alone. I'll be able to buy a house where I have some family. Where will we go, Mrs. Picaud? All the work I've done. But what can I do? More money? No, I'm bored, you are my only visitors. I get it. You are bored? Is that it? - You need company? - Yes. Someone who would come every day? Someone you know a little, who could read to you? - You like that? - I love reading. That would be worth the rent? What? He crossed the Tuileries to reach the Pont Royal, stopping at the top of the bridge, he looked down to the depths of the Seine. There, it's finished. It's so beautiful. Yes... - Is it the end? - Yes. What a pity. What shall we read tomorrow? Would you mind reading that again? You forgot this. Thank you. It's stupid you're leaving. Can't you see how sad Fernand is? We would like you to stay... It's not as I thought it would be. I love you the same, so do they. I have a rehearsal, I must go. Alright, go then. Well, goodbye. Mrs. Picaud is waitin, I must go. Fernand, let's go. I borrowed a van to get my friend's ping-pong, but it has to be back at the police station by 5. Hello Sylvie, you crying? What is wrong? Nothing... Don't cry, your mother comes on Saturday, she'll take care of you. I don't know... We really must go, or I'll be in trouble. I'm comin, just wait a second. I must go. Goodbye, I love you. Me too. Well, then stay... Subtitled by Frances Head Subtitling by Eclair Video
