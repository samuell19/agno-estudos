You little weak cunt! Your brother's such a dickhead. No, he's alright. He's just off his face, that's all. I've got one more song, but first, I've got a friend on the rise, jumping up for a track.

Look at you all grown up now. - You're beautiful. - Thanks. I've grown up, too. Yeah, you still don't have any pubes though. - Fuck off. - Are you guys still in school? Yeah, but Summer's doing music as well. Yeah, she does sick covers of your stuff. Should we grab drinks? Oh. We'll grab 'em. You guys chill here. Drink? Nah, I'm good, thanks. How are we gonna get drinks? Shut up. Let's go. How's your mum doin'? Same. And yours? Same. Hey, what happened to you? You just kind of disappeared all of a sudden. I moved to my auntie's place in Brissy. That bad, huh? Yeah. So, what are you doing after this? Is there, like, a sick VIP party for artists, or? Oh, I've got a 6:00am flight tomorrow, so probably just go have a quiet drink on my own at the motel. Aren't you playing Big Pineapple next month? Yeah, that'll be my first proper festival slot. So, you guys still best friends after all these years, huh? Yeah. Man, I miss home. Anyway, let's stay in touch on Insta, hey? Yes. Should we go scab some drinks before the countdown? - Oh, let's go! - Fuck yeah! Who is on for the countdown? Peking Duk. Seriously gonna do it? No-one's gonna buy 'em for us. Grow a brain, Maxie. We're here with no wristbands and you're going to... Now, now, now! Why did you have to gee him up for it? I didn't think he'd actually do it. Maxie, hurry up. Hurry up. Oh, shit! Maxie! Stay down! Stay down! Summer. Your mum's in no state to drive, but she's given you the okay to go home with James's parents. So, let's call your parents. Do you have to call them? What do you reckon? A call from you guys is not really what they need right now. Please. Look, my mum isn't coping so well with this whole cancer thing and, well, she'll have a heart attack if she gets a call from the cops. Please? I'm sorry. But I've still got to call your parents. Good evening. It's Constable Davey. Am I speaking with... Your mum's got cancer? I do. No, you don't. Yes, I do. No, you don't. Do you really? He's just saying that so the cops don't call his parents. Very clever, James. Bit harsh, but well played. Tell her it was just a prank to get us off. I wish it was a prank. How bad is it? Sweet. I get the test results back in a few weeks. It'll be fine. What kind of... What... Where? Brain tumour. Why didn't you tell us? I was going to tell you guys tomorrow. I just didn't want to ruin New Year's. Everybody out here tonight, grab the person next to you, whether it's a best friend or you just met them. Come on. Ten, nine... Are you going to die? Maxie. No. It's just a tumour. They can cut it straight out. Happy new year! ♪ Dream no more And leave it all behind ♪ How sick was today? - Best day ever. - So good. Hey, so, I've got this idea but I need you guys to help me. What if we make a list of all of our favourite bands and go to as many festivals as possible? There's hardly any left near us. Travel wherever to get to them. - But you're sick. - I'm not dead. Would your parents even let you? They have to. I'm going to be doing stupid fucking treatment and everyone's going to feel sorry for me. So, I may as well do what I want to do. Your mum won't know you're gone. Your brother won't give a shit. You can be the talent, you can be the tour manager, and I'll be the promoter. And by the time we finish school, we can put on our own festivals. You think I'm joking? We know you're not. Marley is playing Big Pineapple next month. That's us! So, are you in or what? Let's do it. How the hell will we get to the Sunshine Coast? James, your mum's on her way to pick up you and Summer. And me? No, we'll need to call your parents. Dad's in gaol. Mum's dead. Sorry to hear that. So, who's your legal guardian? My brother.

Look, look, there it is. James used to love going up there as a kid. Didn't you, James? Remember? No way. I feel so special. So, who's a queen for hooking this up? Boys? You are, Queen Summer. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? You go and have a really good time. Keep your phone on and we'll meet about 6:00pm for dinner, yeah? Just touch base. - Cool. - And no alcohol. I am responsible for you while we are away. You're responsible for them most of the time anyway. - Sweet. - Let's go.

How are you, Danny? Hey, BC. Hey, legend. Maxie. You liking the festival so far? - Yeah. Frothin'. - Good set. Yeah, I bet you guys pump heaps of chicks, hey? Look at us. no way! What do you mean, you little bugger? Dude, I am thinking of putting on something of my own at the end of the year. Oh, wow. Something with a few big main acts and some local acts, you know? Just let me know. Yeah, man. We'll hit you up. "Cheese" on three. Three. Cheese! Look after these boys, hey. You want to come with? Sure. You guys want to chill? Yeah, for sure. You serious? What's this? Business cards. Yeah, I know what it is. But what's it for? Networking, Maxie. Networking. You're a dead-set legend. You okay? I'm just a little nervous. Sit down, sis. James's mum is pretty cool for driving you fellas up. Yeah, she's been very supportive of the whole festival thing. Wish my mum did that for me. Same. Do you remember that night we came home from playing in the park and our mums were passed out? And the firies kicked the door in. And the whole place was up in smoke. Wasn't that a cake in the oven? An ice cream cake in the fucking microwave. Wrapped in foil! Like, what the fuck? How old were we? It was my tenth birthday, so you would have been about five. Fuck. I never understood why people have kids if they're not going to look after 'em, hey? I don't think they choose to be fuck-ups, though. If I were a mum, I'd make sure I was the best mum ever. Me too. Easier said than done, apparently. Hey, how do you feel about coming to a writers workshop with me? What's a writers' workshop? Yours and Owls Festival is putting on an artist camp next month and it's a few days of song-writing, recording, performing, industry insights, you know? Sounds awesome. I think you'll learn a lot. So, you keen? - Knock, knock. - Hey! - Hey. - This is my sister girl Summer I was telling you about. She said yes to coming to the artist house with me. Hey, good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - This is Billy, my manager. Hey, the session tonight, midnight till 10:00am. We've got to get those tracks done and deliver them for the label, yeah? - Of course. - Alright. Catch you soon. So, you've got a manager now? Kinda. He said he'll sign me if something comes of it. This is your business card? - Yeah. - You're promoting? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, cool. - Yeah, I just started out. - Nice. Home printed. I like it. Yeah, yeah. I like it. You got to start somewhere, man. One, two, three. Titties! - What's up? - Maxie. They're little frothers. Maxie. G. Look out, this guy's a promoter. - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah. Take it easy. See you, guys.

Yeah, I did the drums, guitars, vocals, synths. Did it all in my bedroom. That's where you made Jeromo as well, hey? Yeah, yeah, my drum. Yeah. - Awesome. - You know your stuff. Yeah. - It was lovely to meet you. - Yeah, no worries. And have the best time ever. - Awesome. See you, dudes. - Yeah. - See ya! - Laters. The hell! Bliss N Eso, Dune Rats and G Flip.

Now, he's surfing. Maxie's out there trying to hurry him up. Should be there in two hours. Okay, make sure you're not late. I can't do it without you guys. Welcome to the Yours and Owls artist house. As an extension of Yours and Owls, we've curated some incredible artists, not just to perform on the stage, but also to take part in our artists' mentor camp.

Hanging with him, hospital visits, just watching him waste away. I couldn't, hey. I guess you weren't around when mum got sick. - He's not wasting away. - Just trying to give you props for being a decent friend, you little shit. Yeah, well, you told his parents you'd be responsible. Yeah, for getting youse to the festival. Yeah, the one we should have been at hours ago. And you also said you'd buy us tickets to CityFest.

Hope he gets hit by a fucking car on the way back. Ruthless. Let it go, man. I'm so sick of him controlling my life. Always making me do shit I don't want to fucking do. Like what? Maxie, you don't have to put up with his bullshit. Easy for you to say. You don't live with him. I have to cop his shit every day of my fucking life. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear. Why don't you come live with me? I'm serious, man. My parents love you. I'm sure they'll be sweet. But what happens if... You know... I die? Sorry. I shouldn't have said it. It's all good.

Thanks for having me at this amazing artist guesthouse at Yours and Owls Festival. My first festival was a Big Day Out many moons ago. I was the first in the gate and I was so excited, obviously. It's indelibly burned into my memory. Hearing songs for the first time live by bands I'd never heard before and I was overcome by what festivals mean to me and what they can create for people. And so that's where the magic is, I think, in some ways. For us, what we can create, how we can communicate to people. My advice is to the great artists who are about to perform right now, is to, you know, trust your gut, get weird, get weirder, and make it happen. ♪ Untouched by what Potential be there ♪ ♪ I guess I don't mind ♪ ♪ Now I'm standing With the turtles ♪ ♪ Looking like an asshole ♪ ♪ Like, what you want From me, bro ♪ ♪ I was just trying To get some coin ♪ ♪ Uh, it's a game over for me ♪ ♪ I know that we was always In since she heard my CD ♪ ♪ Like ♪ ♪ We were both To what we thought ♪ ♪ Nothing's lost, This is how we trust ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Fair skin, long hair, Blue eyes ♪ ♪ Please tell me Who's this guy ♪ ♪ Caucasian Jesus can't believe ♪ ♪ You tried to make him white ♪ ♪ Brown skin, curled hair, Big nose ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's probably how it goes ♪ ♪ So who's this guy I see ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know Jesus Looks like me, let's go ♪ ♪ Look like me ♪ ♪ What's he look like ♪ ♪ I think he looks like me ♪ Hey, everyone.

Rise and shine. What a massive day we have coming up. This has got to be the biggest event on the Australian music calendar and what a line-up we have. Whoo! How good's this? Festival six. I bet you guys never thought I'd make it. Okay, shit joke. Sorry. But who's going to stop me now? If you're watching this, well, it means I'm long gone. Which means you probably need a pick-me-up, so Maxie's going to hate hearing this first one but I love you guys so much. Sorry if that makes you awkward, Maxie. Get over it. Secondly, even though I didn't make it to festival six, but died trying, I had the best time giving it a good crack with the two best friends anyone could ask for. And if Mum followed through with this one, well, then she's an absolute champion. May your lives remain a music-playing, festival-slaying, dream-chasing adventure. Cheers, cunts. - Cunty. - Cunty. Man, I'm going to miss this shit. I've got something to show you guys. Enjoy. Oi, dickheads! Utopia Valley. This place is an experience beyond the music. The line-up this year is absolutely mental, headlined by Peking Duk, bringing in the new year. Three, two, one. Happy New Year! Not. Maxie. FTP. Big Pineapple, the best and worst day of my life. We met the sickest artists and I became the fourth member of my favourite band, Dune Rats. The referee has stopped this bout at a time of 1 minute, 28 seconds in the first round, declaring the winner by TKO, a new heavyweight champion of the world, The Loose Cannon, Bong Rat, Maximus! What are you making, Maxie? Tattoo gun, man. Our own little tour lives on forever. So, promise me one thing. Don't stop the tally till your arm is a sleeve and I'll keep dancing up here in VIP. Sue to Maxie. Go ahead, Sue. Ten minute warning. I repeat, ten minutes till doors. Copy. Oh, and I've ironed your shirt for you. - It's up in your room. You're such a legend, Sue. ♪ Uh-oh ♪ ♪ Didn't you know My skin was sore ♪ ♪ Didn't you know I felt no more ♪ Ruby Fields needs to be on a flight by 9pm, so she needs to leave by 7:00 pm at the latest. Make sure there's cold tinnies for the Dune Rats. They hate warm beer. So stoked you guys made it out here. We wouldn't miss it. Make sure the music is over by 10:00pm so the neighbours don't call the cops. This is our first festival, so we don't want any heat on us. No way! Marley's here. What? Hey, Marley. - Hey. - Hey. So sorry about James. No, he would have been stoked you came. Wouldn't miss it for the world, bruz. Thanks for coming, Marley. Alright, I'll be back in a sec. Aren't you supposed to be on that US tour? Pulled out of the tour. So sorry. Maybe I wasn't ready to be a mum yet. Hey, you will one day. You'll be an amazing mum. Well, I definitely won't heat up an ice cream cake wrapped in foil in the microwave. Hey, look, I'm sorry if I carried on a little bit. I just wanted you to know that I believe in you.
