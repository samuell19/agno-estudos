(blues music) * I have the lean old blues * Ever since my woman been gone * I had the lean old blues * Ever since my baby been gone * I been standing in my front door * Hoping she'll come back home * I have the lean old blues * Ever since the woman been gone * I had the lean old blues * Ever since my baby been gone * She must got another man * Another man she calls her own - God. I look like a big beach whale. - I believe it's beached whale. That condo is never going to depreciate. I don't give a shit what's going on in the rest of the country, Malibu is not America. - He's back again. Third day in a row. All the guy does is look. He never comes in. This one can't make up his mind. Can I help you? - I think I'm beyond help. I'm looking for an engagement ring. - Congratulations. What do you have in mind? - Well, I want something that looks impressive but doesn't really cost that much. I mean I want it to be nice but, you know. - I think we can find something in that price range. - This is kind of a nice one. How come someone like you doesn't have one of those around your finger by now? - Maybe I haven't found the right guy yet. - Maybe you have but you just don't know it. Here, this is a really beautiful one. May I? Yeah, that's gonna look very good on you. - Well, imagine how good it will look on your fiancee. - Get a haircut. I hope all this laughter is work related. (laughs) No. Which one? - What do you mean which one? Linda. - Linda who? - My Linda. - What you do, draw straws? - Tara, come on, I'm a reformed man here. - Okay, reformed, mm hmm, this is your little black book, A through L. Reformed? (laughing) (clears throat) - Abby, hi, it's Brian. Good, good, how you been? Good. Listen, I'm calling because well you see I just got engaged and you know what happens usually then, you just, you know you move in together and you end up getting married so I don't really think we should see each other. Yeah well I mean at least not for a little while. (dance music) - So how am I supposed to meet women with you all tied up in this marriage deal? - Max, I'm just getting married, I'm not dying. Besides, you don't need me. - Come on, Brian. I'm like one of those little fish that hang around sharks and eat their leftovers. - Remora, they're called remora. Sucker fish. And I'd say that's a very accurate assessment, Max. - You've got your own style, Max, you don't need him. - Think so? - Max, in my experience, women like sensitive, vulnerable men. See table five? What is she thinking, Max? Go on. Since I discovered my feminine side I haven't looked back. - Toni, if what I was gonna do was a major mistake, would you tell me? - If you were to marry any of the others, apart from that really tall one, it would be a mistake, but Linda's a gem. I feel really good about it. - So? - She's not into me. - What'd she say? - Brian Hartley. - What? - She wanted to know who you were. - Double vodka on the rocks. - [Toni] Coming up. - Him? Married? I was married once. To a drummer for two weeks. Then the drugs ran out. - She wants to meet you. - Me? - Mm hmm. You're an oceanographer. (knocking) - Hi. - How the hell did you get here? - The oceanographer. He's got a nice car. He's a sweet kid, really. Thinks the world of your ass. So do I. - Listen, you're gonna have to leave. You can't stay here. I mean it. Um. I'm sorry but I can't do this. And it has nothing to do with you, I mean, I find you to be a very attractive, desirable woman, that's not it. It's just right now I just feel that I. Hello? (light music) - For example, it turns out that the dependent appeasing qualities we identify as female will be exhibited by almost anyone, female or male, in a perilous position. - I can never get all the hair off my knees. Is that a look of patronizing disgust? That's good. - Hi guys. Bye guys. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Slow down. Tell us about your trip, how's your mom? - Losing her mind. She wants to marry some retired sheriff from Arizona. I'll tell you all about everything later. - Wonder where you're going in such a mad rush. - Don't start. Things are different, okay? Brian's been great for the last couple of months. He's changed, he's really changed. - So what's this about? - Oh, that's from that sheriff. I thought Brian would think it was funny. Adios, amigas. - Adios. - Brian. - Oh hi honey. I thought you weren't getting in til tonight. - Couldn't wait, got an earlier flight. I wanted to surprise you. - Excuse me. Do you have any aspirin? - Oh shit. - [Linda] Who's that? - Um, Bliss, this is Linda, Linda, this is Bliss. - How do you do? - Bliss. Perfect. What is it, is it me? You just can't stop, can you? - Linda, I can explain. - No, there is no way you could possibly explain your way out of this one. - Could you argue outside? Oops. - Not only did he have her in our bed, she was wearing our sheets. I can't believe he did it, I can't believe he did it again. - I hate to say it honey but I told you so. - You say this every time this happens. Heartbroken. - That's because it keeps on happening, it's called a pattern. - I don't think she needs to hear that right now, Kim. - You're right. Okay, let's think of the best thing to do. I say we just cut his nuts off. - Vindictive. - Does he just forget how great it is when we're together? (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Brian] Hi, is Linda there? - Oh hi. Yeah, we were just talking about you actually. - Give me that. She doesn't want to talk to you, now or ever again. I'm turning this off. (bluesy music) * You know the devil made me do it (knocking) - Linda. Linda. Linda, are you there? - Go away, she's not here. - And she doesn't want to see you. - Listen, I know you're mad but it's not what you think. Please let me explain, just give me 30 seconds face to face. I need to talk to you. - You've seen too much of her already, just vacate. - Look, I know it's hard to believe but I didn't do anything with that girl. I don't even know her name. - What else is new? - Listen Linda. Hon, just open the door. Just look into my eyes and if you think I'm lying, tell me to go and I'll go. Please? I love you. I do. (romantic music) (horn honking) - Come on Brian, let's go! - She needs a lift to work. I know it doesn't really look good but I just... * I'm going way out west * I'm gonna stop off in old New Mexico * I'm going way out west * I'm gonna stop up in old New Mexico - You look like crap. What are you out celebrating that engagement? - Hardly. - Listen, the whole office staff we wanna apologize for laughing at you yesterday. I mean we are really happy that you're getting engaged. You got the blues. - I know. - How could you possibly know, I just decided to give it to you. - You mean the blues article? The cover? Are you serious? Oh my god, Tara, thank you so much. I can't thank you... - Look, we'll just consider this an engagement present. - Try to. - Kim, doesn't Linda look fabulous? - Breathtaking. - I look like shit. I feel like shit. I'm not going. - No no no, come on, come on, there'll be tons of cute guys there. - Who cares? - Oh, you do, it's the best way to forget about what's his name, come on. - God. Maybe I should just let him explain. - I don't believe you. How many times is this gonna happen before you wake up? What do you wanna do, stay at home while he's out doing god knows what with god knows who? - No, here's your purse, come on. Come on. - Brian. What are you doing here? Thought you'd be with Linda. - She got an earlier flight. - How early? - Early enough to join Bliss and me for coffee. - I hope she didn't. - She did. - I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I thought I was doing you a favor. - It's okay Max, it's okay. It's not your fault, these things happen, I guess. - What was the name of that book? When bad things happen to slime? - JJ. - Hey, it's not totally over with you guys, is it? - Forget it man, I don't wanna talk about that. Got some good news though. I got my first cover story today. Subject, the blues. Classic blues. This story is gonna make me. I should be celebrating. - It really is over. - Toni, turn it up, LA's bringing in that rookie quarterback and the guy is awesome. - Have you talked to her? Have you really talked to her? - She won't speak to me. And you know I didn't even sleep with this woman. Which is ironic because every time I was guilty Linda always forgave me, now that I'm innocent she won't. - What you've got to do is this. You're to bring her some roses, pink roses. Champagne, teddy bear. What does her lease say about pets 'cause puppies always work. - No pets. - Get her a bigger bear. (mellow tropical music) (knocking) - You look like a walking cliche. Where's the puppy? - I locked him in the trunk of my car. - That wouldn't surprise me. - Could I talk to Linda please? - She's not here. - Like she wasn't here this morning? - She happens to be at an exclusive party with wonderful, nurturing men and she's never looked better. - That's terrific, could I just talk to her please? - Get lost. Loser. (gasps) I am tempted. You think you can come into our house whenever you want? - Cut the crap, Kim. I know she's here, where is she? - [Kim] You're breaking the law. - Put the knife down. Linda. Come on out, honey. - You've got five seconds to get your ass out of here or I'm calling the cops. - Give me a chance to explain. - [Kim] One. - Please? - Two. - Where the hell is she? - Three. Four. - Go ahead Kim, call. I'll find her and you can't stop me. Nothing can stop me. Not the cops, not that knife, and certainly not you and your petty, pathetic, puritanical little self! (bangs) - Five. Hiya tiger. Comfy? You can't walk through windows. You're not going anywhere. Kim knows knots. Scouts honor. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Black belt too, in case you had any ideas. By the way, Linda brought this for you from Arizona. She thought you'd think it was funny. - Listen Kim, you'd better untie me, I am serious. - Hasn't she done a great job with this room? The Sunday Times did a layout on it. Her career is really taking off. It's just her personal life that needs an adjustment. - Kim, I am warning you. I am gonna ask you one final time as nicely and politely as I possibly can. Untie these fucking ropes now you stupid cow! - Now I'm confused. I thought that you wanted to see Linda when she got home. If she came home. But then again she might get lucky tonight and then I'd have you all to myself. We wouldn't want anybody knowing you're here now, would we? - God! (mysterious music) - Nice car. Surprising power. Do they float? - That's not funny, Kim. None of this is funny. - I'm laughing. (laughing) - What's so funny? - [Kim] Nothing, bad joke. How was the opening? - Okay I guess. - Oh get outta here, she had half the guys there wrapped around her little finger. - I guess I did meet a few nice guys. - See? And there's more where they came from. - Linda! - What is that? - The bad joke. - [Brian] Linda! - That's Brian. - Oh thank god you're here. - What's going on? Who did this? - He did it to himself. - Bullshit. That bitch did it. - Why is it that men always stoop to the infantile level of name calling? - This is so cool. - It's cruel. - It's necessary. - Whenever the three of you decide exactly what it is, I would like to be untied. Thank you. - Oh. This time he's not getting off so easy. - Get your hands off me. - The anger is good. It's just directed at the wrong person. It's time we talk. - Are you turned on? - Sharon, you're still an actress, aren't you? - Yeah. I've done a bunch of plays and some commercials and a cable show. - That's great. Listen, I know some of the biggest names in show business. If you untie me now, I'll make sure you get to see them. - Really? So you've known me for over a year and you could have helped me with a phone call? You dick! - Sharon, wait! - I don't care if he deserves it, it's illegal and immoral and I'm not doing it, I'm untying him. - Fine, untie him. Then forgive him. And be sure not to express your real feelings. Just keep giving him the message that it's okay to treat you like dirt. (thoughtful music) - Here's what you do. Untie one hand so I can reach the phone, call the agent, you can be in his office first thing tomorrow morning. - Not really a morning person. - Afternoon then, anytime you want. - Well. Maybe just one. - Sharon, what do you think you're doing? - Making a career move. - [Kim] Don't. - I got a great idea. Why don't we end this ridiculous game? You can untie me and I can take the four of us out to a fabulous dinner, my treat, okay? Forgive and forget. - That sounds familiar. I forgive, you forget. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - It means that every time you get a fucking itch it's okay for your to scratch it, and Linda's supposed to act like a good sport and pretend it doesn't hurt. - Who I scratch is none of your goddamn business. - Oh, but it most certainly is. Think back. Four years ago. West Beach Cafe. The new (mumbles) had just arrived. - Oh my god. - Three bottles later, the lifeguard station, station 27 to be exact. And you never called. It was a long time before I met you. - Well. I feel so left out. - I'm sorry Linda, I shouldn't have brought it up. We were both blitzed, I barely even remember it. - Lifeguard station 27 to be exact? - To tell you the truth, he couldn't even get it up. - Well look what he had to work with. - Touche. (laughing) - On a more serious note. - Yes. - What are we gonna do with all those vegetables? (sneaky music) - Sharon, what's? - Did you ever see that movie 9 1/2 Weeks? - Please untie me, I beg you. I think Kim's gonna kill me. - I know she'll kill me if I untie you. - Please? - Okay, but you have to do something for me first. If you can guess 10 vegetables in a row, I'll untie you. Open wide. - God help me. Squash? - What kind? - What kind? Acorn? - No. Summer squash. - Oh god. - Isn't this fun? - [Brian] Fun? - This reminds me of my secret fantasy. In my fantasy I just feed a man who eats and doesn't talk. He listens to me and he doesn't judge me. He takes me seriously and he wears those hip high rubber wading boots, you know, the kind that trout fishermen wear? - I think I finally found a sucker for that duplex out in Trancas. - We're not gonna just leave him here today, are we? - Who? Oh, him. Sure. Give him a little time to think things out. - I guess. - Well, are we or aren't we? Gonna let him go? - Not just yet. - Good. This is kinda like breaking the law, isn't it? The lease says no pets, right? (laughing) - You must be hungry. - No, I just want out of here. Please untie me. - I can't. - Why not? Commandant Kim won't authorize it? What happened to the independent, freethinking woman that I know and love? - She's wising up. - I got you an engagement ring. - Really? Where is it? - It's on my nightstand. Listen, take my keys and drive over to my house if you don't believe me. You know, this isn't exactly the way I'd intended on asking you to marry me. But it doesn't have to be this way. Untie me now. And I'll get down on one knee and everything. I'll do it right. Right after I get back from the office. The most important meeting of my life is happening in half an hour. Did I tell you I got my first cover story? On the thing that I love the most, I mean besides you. On the blues. Classic blues. Slim Jim Bone is actually gonna be there. Linda. Wait, I can do it before work! I can be a little late! Wait, you just can't leave me here like this! What am I gonna do all day? Channel 26. There's a Cub game on in a little while. - Yeah, I hear it's supposed to be a really great game. Have a nice day. (clapping) - Nice, very nice. Might I suggest one last touch. (volume increasing) - [Announcer] Oh, you're gonna have a perfect set then. - [Caller] Yeah. - [Announcer] Yeah you'll have that perfect match well this is great. - [Caller] Looks beautiful. - [Announcer] It is beautiful Millie and those are white topaz and they look like diamonds, don't they? - [Caller] They certainly do. - [Announcer] Let me send you to, thank you, bye bye! Now everybody, everybody, I want you to make sure to call in on this bargain, now we're gonna keep it on the screen just a few more minutes. - Brian, would you say that you're in terrible pain or that it's more like, you know, torture? - I don't know. I mean I'm miserable but my ears aren't like bleeding or anything yet. I would say torture. No, more like mental anguish. - Mental anguish. Cool. Thanks Brian. - [Announcer] That's an incredible bargain, but we're gonna have to go to the music box soon so you call in while you still have that chance. Oh, thank you Millie for calling in, we really appreciate... (funky music) - Bye bye. - Adios. - [Caller] I've got two sets of these for my sisters when they first came out on the air. - [Announcer] Oh you did? - [Caller] Yes, and I gave them for I think it was a Valentine's present. And they wear them all, and that's about a year and a half ago. - [Announcer] Oh my goodness... - In exactly one hour Mr. Bone is on that plane back to New York. This is incredibly inconsiderate to my client and to our label. - I'm terribly sorry Mr. Bone, this is not like Brian at all. - We were under the impression that this organization understood just how valuable Mr. Bone's time is. - Sorry. - [Caller] And they're so beautiful, the luster on them are gorgeous and when I gave them to 'em it was like I gave them a million dollars when they opened up the box. - [Announcer] Is that right? - [Caller] Yes, they are gorgeous, they really are, and if the prices compared to (mumbles) you cannot... - [Assistant] Yes ma'am. - Try that little shit again. - [Announcer] Slept on one last deal for $175, a diamond ring with a boheme emerald. This is the buy of the week. - 175 bucks? I paid two grand for the same fucking ring. - [Voicemail] Hi, this is Brian Hartley. Leave me a message, I'll get back to you as soon as possible. (beeps) - Where the hell are you? Do you want this article or not? Too damn nice. - [Announcer] Tell you we will not have these back again, a beautiful zirconium necklace and earrings. This is the last call, we only have a few left. - Oh, you like this too? - I have to seriously pee. - Oh, they're selling the alpha gym. I wish I could afford one of those. - We can. You don't mind, do you hon? - Buy two, just let me go to the bathroom. - Really? - Oh! - Conga line! Come on! - Could you close the door? I can't pee if there's anybody watching. - It's true. (urinating) - That was really sweet of Brian to buy us those alpha gyms. - You actually bought two of them? - Well he told me to. - Well he would have said anything to get to go to the bathroom. - Oops. Boy, he really had to go. - Brian, are you okay in there? Brian? He had to go alright. He's gone. - What? Where is he? Stop right where you are! Where do you think you're going? - Can't you just ever stay home? We trusted you. - Trust isn't in his vocabulary. Let's get him back to the house. - God, maybe we should just leave him here. Let the vultures eat his flesh. - Exactly. - Here's a thought. How 'bout you untie me and I walk. - Here's a thought. Not. - I'll be right back. (groovy music) - I still have to pee. - You can have your pants back, as soon as they're dry. - You know there's nothing better when you're hungry than a nice barbecue. Little red meat, little chicken, little corn on the cob. - Pity there's not enough for you too, but gotta stay a perfect size six. - Hi. - Hi Max. Seen Brian? How'd he make out? - Just about to ask you the same thing. - I'm sure he's in Linda's bed having the time of his life. - Linda! - God, hell of a game, huh? - You guys, I was thinking. - You shouldn't. - What Sharon? - Maybe we should let him go. - Negative. - Well then maybe we should do something about his diet. I mean, nothing but squash? - Sharon's right. Tomorrow turnips. (laughing) Oh come on, that's funny. Honey? I decided to let you watch the game. - Well it's over by now. - I taped it for you. - Really? - Where the hell are you, man? You alive? Are you dead? You still talking to me? (speaking foreign language) Still nothing. I'm really starting to get worried. - He should marry you instead. - He's disappeared before, he's moody. - But it's been two days. - Check the milk cartons. - Toni, would you mind if I kill her? - Brian'll be fine, he can look after himself. JJ. Check missing persons. Just do it. (football announcers) - I've never seen anything like it. - It's amazing, isn't it? - It reminds me of those dog commercials where they've starved the dogs for a week. - It's just incredible. He's been tied up, humiliated, starved, and made to wear a skirt and I've never seen him look happier. - Incredible game, huh? - Mm hmm. - What's the score? - Yeah. - We've decided to castrate you. - Good. - You really love football, don't you? - What? - Then you're gonna love the way this one ends. - Hey, I can't see with you standing in front of the screen. - You would think Los Angeles up by three with 10 seconds to go had it won. - Don't. - It was just incredible. All they had to do was run the clock out, the way Kansas City did in the season opener. - Please. - But the idiots fumbled the ball and New York ran it back 76 yards for a touchdown. It was the darndest thing I ever saw. Would you care to watch the rest of the game or should I just shut it off? You're right. You've had enough excitement for one night. (sneaky music) - Brian. Are you asleep? - No, I was just relaxing. - I need you. - You what? (heavy breathing) - Those must be, those must be 10 inches apiece. - [Brian] They do have their uses, I'll admit. - I never knew having an alien could be so fantastic. - God, you're incredible. How do you say this stuff and make it sound believable? - Practice. I'm hoping this will be a break for me. - What's the title of the movie? - Bride of the Giant Licking Thing. It's a sequel. - Well hey, it's work. - Thanks Brian. - Giant Licking Thing. - Okay. Before we go to work I'd like to know what we're going to do with him from here on out. I mean, exactly what is the plan? - I don't have a plan. - You don't? - No. This is just all improv. - We have a hostage tied up against his will who we've subjected to numerous tortures and who if freed could probably put us in jail until menopause and we don't know what we're gonna do with him? We don't have a fucking plan? No. (laughing) (upbeat funky music) - Hatha yoga? - It's my beard, it's itching like crazy. - Sharon. - Linda. Will you stay here with me today? - I would love to hon, but I have the most important meeting of my life today. You understand. - Honey. Linda? You're not just gonna leave me here alone all day? - You won't be. - Brian, I hope whatever it is that you're doing it's worth it. What do you know about the blues? - Our father who art in heaven, if you could find it in your heart to get me the fuck outta here right now, I will be so good. Hell father, you won't even recognize me, I swear. Thanks a lot. (mysterious music) - I know you think I'm kind of a bitch. And sometimes I probably can be. But I have my good side too. You still need that itch scratched? - Does my answer even matter? - No. This should help. It's only been three years, it's probably still good. - Wait, that thing's rusty! - Picky picky. This is for Mike Steverman who told everybody he got to third base with me when he barely even touched my knee. - Ow! - And this is for Peter Tufo, who stood me up at the junior prom. And this is for lifeguard station 27. (knocking) - Help, somebody please! - Don't even think about it. - Detective Steinham. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. - Steinham. You're not related to Gloria Steinham, are you? - No, but I subscribe to her magazine. - Really? - Well to be honest with you it's a little known fact. Wouldn't sit well with the boys down at the station. But maybe that's just my own insecurities. I'm investigating the disappearance of a Brian Hartley. - Brian disappeared? - Looks like you've been shaving Sasquatch. - No, no, it's my dog. He's going into the hospital for an operation and I'm the only one he lets shave him. - Where is the little cuss? - He's on the beach. He went out for a run. You know, one last run. - Of course. Would you mind if I look around a bit? - No, no, could I get you a cup of coffee? - No thanks, but how 'bout a nice herb tea? Seems Mr. Hartley disappeared almost three days ago. - You don't say. Well, I know Brian. He goes out with one of my roommates. Used to. You never knew with those two. - [Steinham] So they fight a lot? - Don't all couples? - I don't know. It's been five years since my wife left me. - I'm sorry. - Heck, I don't blame her. I never gave her the respect she deserved. Ma'am. - Kim. Call me Kim. - It's just procedure, Kim, but do you mind if I take a look around the house? - Go right ahead. Well I guess you've seen everything. - Just about, just about. We haven't looked in this room here. - No! You can't. - Why not? - It's tea time. And besides detective, that's where the body is. (laughing) - You almost had me there for a second. And call me Frank. - Okay, Frank. (muffled screaming) - I really hope your dog's okay. You never did say his name. - It's a she, her name's Tosca. - That's pretty. I got a couple at home. Labs. I don't know what I'd do without them. Dogs are great, aren't they? - Yeah. - For Tosca, when she gets out of the doggie hospital. Get in touch with me if you hear anything about Brian. - Thanks. I will. (siren wailing) (gunshots) - Hi Kim. When did you start watching this crap? - Nothing wrong with these shows. - Officer Steinham? Who's that? - A guy I met. - Where'd you meet him? - Here. - When? - Today. - A cop was here today? - What'd he look like? - He's dreamy. Warm, sensitive, nurturing. I'm thinking of getting a dog. - Did he find Brian? - No. - Was he wearing those big high black boots? - You know that shaved armpit really got to me. Maybe we've gone too far. I have a feeling if we let him go now I can get him to promise not to press charges. - His promises aren't worth shit. - Kim. He's had enough. I think he's learned his lesson. - You're still ready to let him off the hook. Pretty soon you'll be his little love slave again. - Bullshit! I just want him out of my life and as long as he's here he's still in it! - Fine, let him go. In a couple of days, maybe a week, he'll come crawling back like he always does. Dinner at the Ivy, then maybe a weekend trip to the wine country to get to know each other again. Pretty soon you've forgiven him for every shitty, unforgivable violation and then, presto, the happy couple. Until, well you know the rest. (gentle music) - Hi. - Hi. - See what that butcher friend of yours did to me? - Doesn't look that bad. - Yeah. Well if nothing else it'll probably take a couple of seconds off my time in the 100 meter butterfly. We have fun together sometimes, don't we? - We really do. It's a pity. - It doesn't have to be. I wasn't kidding before about the ring. - Don't talk like that unless you mean it. - I do. Untie me right now, and our new life together begins, starting tonight with a romantic dinner somewhere. And when was the last time we went to the Ivy? Wouldn't that be great? And then we can just pile into the car, and drive up north somewhere for the weekend, just you and me? - Where exactly? - I dunno. I was thinking like Carmel or Big Sur. Napa maybe, do a little wine tasting. I mean I just figure after everything that we've been through, we really kinda owe it to ourselves to get to know each other again. - Get to know each other again. - Yeah. Sounds good, doesn't it? - I'll tell you what it sounds like. Sounds like the same old recycled crap I've been buying for years. How many times have you told me you love me and then were unfaithful? You know, your friends think you're some kind of slick Casanova, but all you really are is just a cheap whore with no moral center, nothing inside, you're just pathetic! You have hurt me so many times and I will not allow it to happen again! What you have done to me is not okay, do you hear me? I am so fucking angry at you I could kill you! - Linda honey, listen. I just, honey, what are you doing? Hey, look. - God, I wish I didn't have to do this. - Linda no! - Yes! (clapping) - [Sharon] Way to go Linda! - Alright Linda, set him free, congratulations! (blues music) - Yeehaw! Food. - [Server] What'll it be, buddy? - Anything, plenty of it. What you guys looking at? - [Voicemail] Hi, this is Brian Hartley, I'm not available to, wait a second, yes I am. I am available. The rumors of my engagement have been greatly exaggerated, I am a free man. Free at last, disentangled, untied, untethered, unencumbered, unfettered, unbridled, and outta here. (beeps) - He's alive. - [Brian] Barely. - Where you been? - Don't ask. - You look like shit. - You got flat feet. - You're unemployed. - Do you mean that? - I gave the blues article to Joey. - What? - Look you get an article on my desk by Friday, we'll see. - Okay. That's fair. - Cute. Too cute. - Well what do you know? See, I told you you didn't have to worry about the boy. - Where the hell you been? - Don't ask. - Well we're asking. - Okay, if you insist. I was tied up in bed and held hostage by three women. - [Max] Seriously? - God's honest truth. - Three women, just you, and you didn't call me? - Maxy, trust me, my hands were, nevermind. Toni. - Shaved you, huh? - Yeah, how'd you know? - Think I never kidnapped a man before? - So I guess one of the three kidnappers didn't happen to be Linda, did it? - Uh huh. - Guess that means the engagement's off? - Didn't even get a chance to propose. - Cheer up. Look at all the women here. - Hey Maxy. See the redhead over there nursing the bloody mary? - She looks awfully lonely, doesn't she? - [Max] Real lonely. - I bet you she and I are out of here in 30 minutes flat. - Got a bet. - Deal. - You know, if losing money makes you that happy, think how good you'd feel if you started tipping. - He's back. - Kim. If you like that policeman so much, why don't you just call him? His card's right there. - I've never known you to be so shy. (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh, hi. No, Linda doesn't want to talk to you. - I don't want your money. - But you won. - No Max, I lost. - [Max] You got her out of here under 30 minutes. - Listen to you. Look at us, this is sick. - Of course it is. I want details, what happened? - Nothing happened. - What the hell's going on here? He won't take my money and he's telling me nothing happened. - Could be the leopard's changing his spots. - Could be. Nothing at all? - It was the most amazing thing. We went back to her place. She invited me in. Put on some soft music, cracked open a bottle of Moet. - And? - And I left. Never happened to me before. - You alright? - Do I seem like someone who has no moral center? - Still crazy about her, aren't you? - I can't stop thinking about her. - But she busted your chops. - Yeah. Yeah, you bet she did. - You lost me. (speaking Spanish) - Have you tried talking to her? - Nonstop. I mean I can't even get next to the girl, her roommates are like guard dogs. - But you're a writer. Be creative. - Easier said than done. - Whatever it takes, do it. (keyboard clicking) (soft music) (moves to upbeat music) - Yes, Detective Steinham, please. Yes, it is an emergency. Thank you. Maxy, hi, oh, sorry to wake you. Listen, I'm sorry to bother you but I really need you to do something for me. Okay. You know the bait and tackle shop on PCH? - You don't say much, do you? That's okay. I like a man who's a good listener. My grandpa Walt never said much. And I used to dress up and put on shows for him. And he would watch and clap and then he would take me fishing and he had boots just like yours. I love those boots! They remind me of him and summers in Montana, that's where I'm from, Montana. Did you ever see that movie 9 1/2 Weeks? (knocking) - Detective Steinham. - Sorry to bother you, ma'am. - Kim, remember? - Kim. See I got a phone call, probably some wacko, something about somebody tied up here in that room I never searched. - How odd. Well, come right in and search to your heart's content. You know where the room is. (romantic music) I'll go get you a cup of tea. (knocking) - Come in. - Ma'am. Nobody tied up in here. - Not today. - This must be Tosca's. (laughs) - I'm so embarrassed. Let me get you something to clean that up. - Looks like she's just fine after the operation. Wait. No wait, wait wait wait. I thought Tosca was a dark haired dog. - Traumatic operation. Must have aged her. - You're gonna have to explain that one to me. Over breakfast. (knocking) - Who is it? - Delivery. Alpha gym. 10 minutes, that's all I ask, just 10 minutes. - Out. - Linda, you have to listen to me. - I don't have to do anything. - Look, I'm trying to talk to you. Linda. Come on. Hey, come here. - Get your hands off me. Just leave. - Five minutes. - Not one minute, there is nothing in this world that could make me listen to a thing you have to say. (blues music) - People fuck up. Guess it's just human nature. And I guess I'm more human than most. You know, people can change. Oh look, there's the crab house where we had our second date. You're right, third date. - Brian, get me out of this bag! Don't touch me! Oh god. This is really pissing me off. Just put me down! I told you not to touch me! How dare you? What the hell gives you the right to break into my home and stuff me into a duffle bag like a load of dirty laundry and then brutally force me back to your swinging bachelor pad? - Love. - Oh, please! You don't even know the meaning of the word. Now if you think that you have gotten this caveman behavior out of your system, I would like to be taken home immediately. I said take me home! Caveman is way too good for you. Barney Rubble was 100 times more evolved. Brian, this is kidnapping, it's a felony. - Well, you should know. - Okay, you've got me, I'm your captive. Now what? - I don't know exactly. - Well when you figure it out, you know where I'll be. - Got it. Do you know what this is? This is my address book. It means nothing to me, it means less than nothing. Do you know what this is? This is a blazing inferno. I am destroying my notebook. See? Linda. Still not talking, huh? Maybe if you were a little more comfortable. Here you go. Better? Remember these? You and me on the big island. Do we look like tourists or what? Oh now here's one that I know you're not gonna remember 'cause you happened to be asleep at the time. Wow, look at these tan lines. Come to think of it looks more like burn lines. Don't you think? - Brian! - She speaks! - Who else saw that picture? - No one, no one else, I promise, I swear. Now these two are my favorite. Companion pieces. (clears throat) Remember that day when we hiked for hours up to that little grotto with the waterfall? I shot you, you shot me. - Let me see. - I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. (Hawaiian music) - What are you doing? - Where were we? Oh, that's right, shh, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now we're in Hawaii. There are palm trees, and you breathe in deep and what do you smell? - Coconut. Oh no. - Oh yes. - Oh no. Oh no. (moaning) It's so hard to trust you. - I told you nothing happened with me and that Bliss girl. - There were others, weren't there? That I didn't know about? - Yeah, there were others. That was before I realized that I was sick in love with you. - So you honestly think you're ready to make a commitment to something more permanent? - Wait a second. (phone rings) - [Voicemail] Hi, this is Brian Hartley. And I'm not available to, wait a second, yes I am. I am available. The rumors of my engagement have been greatly exaggerated. I am a free man. Free at last. Disentangled, untied... - I left that message the day I got home. I was out of my mind. - Untie me, I wanna go home. - Linda, I swear. - Let me go. - Do you want a ride home? This is Brian Hartley, and to whom it may concern, I am madly and passionately, desperately, and exclusively in love with Linda. (blues music) - Great job on the article, man. - What are you doing? - Cleaning out my desk. After blowing the assignment and missing an entire week of work I figured I was fired. - Honey, trust me, when I fire you, you will know it. Nah, we just gonna consider that last week squandered vacation time. I got you a new assignment. I want you to find LA's best bed and breakfast. (funky music) - You look dreadful. - Yeah, well you look pretty spiffy yourself. - Taking it out on me, Brian? - Sorry. Where's Maxy? - He's over there. Trying out his new style. - Thanks. Max. - Hey. - Dude, happening head gear. - It belonged to Walt, Sharon's grandfather. - No kidding. Sharon, I've been meaning to tell you, I don't know anyone in show business. I'm sorry. - I know Brian. - You do? - Yeah. It's okay. He's got those boots. - Oh, good for you. - Hey JJ. Take a look at Max. Never seen him look so happy. - We should go. You wanna join us? - Um. Fifth wheel, I think I'm just gonna get a drink and probably go home. But go, enjoy yourselves. - Bye. - So you here for the other pit? - A few days ago the idea of doing anything to improve the quality of your life would have been at the very bottom of my list of things to do. - I'm stunned. - Can the sarcasm. I am trying to help you, and that is not easy for me to do. Get your ass down to the beach house. I can't take another second of that hideous Hawaiian music. Catch my drift? By the way, he's taking me home to meet the dogs. (blues music) (knocking) - Linda, open up. I know you're there, I saw your car. Linda, are you okay? (dog barking) Get off! Down boy. Ow, ow, come on, be a good dog. - What are you doing? Can't you just knock like a normal person? - I did but nobody answered. Think you could just kind of make it go away? New dog, huh? - It's Kim's. - Very friendly animal. - She doesn't know you. - Changed the message. - I know. - You do? - I called. I hung up. About 20 times. (soft music) - Well I meant it. But I'll change it if you want me to. - Don't. - Linda, I know I have to change. - Yeah. Yeah. I need time to forgive you and I don't even know if I can. - Well. I got this for you. And I want you to keep it anyway. And just know that my feelings for you aren't gonna change. I'll wait for you. - I'll think about it. - Okay. - I've changed, Brian. Are you ready for that? - Yes. - I might need to tie you up once in a while. (laughing) How do you like the new knots? - God I've missed you. - Shh. I just want you to lie there and shut up. If you close your eyes it's almost like Hawaii. - Maybe put on some of that Hawaiian music. - I don't have any Hawaiian music. - You don't? But Kim...
