Nina. Hmm. Um... [SIGHS] You want me to start moving the rest of this camera stuff? No, that's all right, I'll get it. Thanks. - [NINA EXHALES] - Um... [CLEARS THROAT] When you gonna give Marvin back his ring? Just curious. Girl, please. I would if I knew where the hell he was. Or maybe I'll just keep it as a reminder... [SIGHS] ...never to make the same mistake twice. Getting engaged? - No, falling in love. - Oh, shit. Because that shit is played out like an eight-track. Hello, hello. Don't leave me hangin', please. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. A cynic is born. Hallelujah. - [POET] Resurrected from the tomb. - [BONGO DRUMS PLAYING] Can we talk, Nappy Head? I mean, really, really talk, Nappy Head. I ain't talkin', talkin' in them tediously taut tones of tortuously tangled and toughed-up tongues. But can you speak to me in your language of divinity? With your miracle of ritual and spiritual drum, can you-- [VOCALIZING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING, EXCLAIMING] - Am I talking to you? - No, but I'm in your conversation. - No, am I taking to you? - Why is she always like this? Sheila, what you need is a man to get in a conversation with. Excuse me, Ed, but I have a man, thank you. - [ED] And where is he? - He's not here. Well, Sheila, I know what you need girl. You need some romance in your life. And I'm sure you're an expert on that, hmm? Oh, yes, indeedy, I am. Wood, you are the least romantic man I know. I think that I am Mr. Romance. You know, I believe in that shit like flowers, candy, all that. Just not every day. - That's not me. - [SHEILA LAUGHING] - It could be cold. Know what I mean? - That's what I'm talking about. Oh! Can we... love? [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING] "'Romance is dead' is what they said while sitting around, cheating at pool. At the very last frame of this nine-ball game, the cat who had the date on the top of the Empire State is the one who got hustled like a fool." - Ooh. - [HISSES] - [ED] You watch too many movies, Sheila. - Step off, Ed. All right? What's up? [CHUCKLES] Romance is about the possibility of the thing. You see, it's about the time between when you first meet some fine-ass woman and when you first make love to her. Or when you first ask a woman to marry you and when she says, "I do." When people who have been together for a long time say that the romance is gone... Mm-mmm. ...what they really saying is - they've exhausted the possibility. - Mm-mm-mmm. - Savon. - Now you're talking about my thing. - [HISSES] - They won't hear me, bruh. - [LAUGHS] Go on. - [ED] It's like poetry is the possibility of language. - Please. - [DARIUS] Ooh. Give me a break. - Where you want it at? - Hey, Von, let me get my lighter, man. - [SAVON] Here you go. - Thank you. - I said Savon. - [SHEILA] I know what you said. - I don't know what's wrong with that girl. - No, he doesn't need to be smoking. - Thank you, Mom. - You're welcome. I thought we left our mothers at home. - [NINA] Do you want another drink? - Actually, I am okay for now. [NINA] I'm going to get one. I'm bringing you one anyway. Thank you, 'cause I'ma hit this off real quick. Hey, Will, let me get another one, man. Cool. White wine, please. [WOOD] Who's that girl with Darius? Damn. She does have a little somethin'-somethin'. - Uh, excuse me, Mr. Married Man. - I am married, I am not blind. Brother, can you see through these, please? Can you see — - Everything is checking out. - That's what I'm talking about. - Niggas just ain't right. - Niggas? - Why we gotta be ni — - Because that's what y'all are. Deep in thought, huh? Yeah. What are you thinking about? A woman I saw once. She must have been fine. Savon, you can't tell me that these babes can't see that cool pose shit coming a mile off. You know, brother, jealousy is a sickness. - Let it go, man. - [SAVON] Sickness. [ED] Let it go. - And just walk away. - [LAUGHTER] [WOOD] Fuck you, Ed. Darius Lovehall. Nina Mosley. - [BARTENDER] That'll be $4.00. - [NINA GASPS] Fumble, just like I told you. - [DARIUS CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me. - Mm-hmm. - Will, put this on your tab. - [WILL] Yeah, right. - Put that energy out there. - [SHEILA] Say "thank you." You put it out there. That's a fumble, bro. - You put the energy out — - [SHEILA LAUGHS] - Anybody in here can see that. - Oh, please. - Sorry about that. - [WILL] Here you go. Try not to knock this one over. Maybe you should quit smoking. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] All right, all right. Get settled. We're back. This next brother up on the mike writes for New City and is regularly here on Monday nights. So please, give it to Mr. Darius Lovehall. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, WHOOPING] - Thank you, brother Ed. - All right. All right, this is a little something I've been working on. It's new. I call it, uh... "A Blues for Nina." [PERSON IN AUDIENCE] Yes, baby! - [PERSON 2] All right! Uh-huh. - [PERSON 3] Yeah. Take your time. [BAND PLAYING JAZZ BLUES] [PERSON 4] My man! [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] Say, baby. Can I be your slave? [AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING] I've got to admit, girl, you're the shit, girl, and I'm digging you like a grave. Now, do they call you daughter to the spinning pulsar? Or maybe Queen of 10,000 Moons? Sister to the distant, yet rising star. Is your name Yemaya? - [MUSIC STOPS] - [AUDIENCE CHATTERING] Oh, hell no. It's got to be Oshun. - [MUSIC CONTINUES] - [DARIUS] Ooh. - [CHUCKLES] - [AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING] Is that a smile me put on your face, child, wide as a field of jasmine and clover? Talk that talk, honey, walk that walk, money, high on legs that'll spite Jehovah. - [CHUCKLES] Shit. - [AUDIENCE WHOOPING] Who am I? It's not important. - But they call me brother to the night. - [PERSON] Well, all right! And right now, I'm the blues in your left thigh... tryin' to become the funk in your right. Who am I? I'll be whoever you say. But right now I'm the sight-raped hunter blindly pursuing you as my prey. And I just wanna give you injections of sublime erections and get you to dance to my rhythm, make you dream archetypes of Black angels in flight upon wings of distorted, contorted, metaphoric jism. Aw, come on, slim. Fuck your man. I ain't worried about him. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, EXCLAIMING] It's you who I want to step to my scene. 'Cause rather than deal with the fallacy of this dry-ass reality, I'd rather dance and romance your sweet ass in a wet dream. Mmm. Who am I? [CHUCKLES] Well, they all call me brother to the night, and right now I'm the blues in your left thigh... tryin' to become the funk in your right. ♪ Is that all right? ♪ [PERSON IN AUDIENCE] Oh, that's all right, baby! [AUDIENCE CLAPPING, CHEERING] Bravo! Darius Lovehall. [CHUCKLES] Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. No, no, no, come on now, Wood. You gotta give him his props for that one. You gotta give it up, Wood. Give it up. Come on, give it up. Yeah, whatever. But I'll tell you one thing — I don't need poetry to get women. - No, you need a personality to get women. - Mmm. Mmm. - Try a breath mint and a Visa. - [ALL LAUGH] Played out like an eight-track. You did say that, didn't you? [LAUGHS] Here come your boy. Here come your boy. - [SAVON] What's up, D? - [SHEILA] Hey. - D, great poem. - Y'all liked that, huh? - It was fascinating. - [SAVON] Be nice. - Thanks. - [SHEILA] Look at that. - [SAVON] Who's Nina? - [WOOD] I loved it, Darius. [SHEILA] Green glob just coming all out your mouth. [WOOD] You don't know me like that. [SAVON] We need to embrace this brother. You're a bad influence. - Every last — Especially you. - Why? - You're the worst influence of all. - Oh, don't even try. Don't even — [CLEARS THROAT] Thanks for my poem. It was, um... interesting. No problem. Everybody, this is, uh, Nina. - Hi. - [DARIUS] Sheila. Ed. - Savon. And that's Hollywood. - How you doing, Nina? - This is my girl, Josie. - Hello, hello, hello, hello. So, maybe next week you could write something for me. Maybe. But it won't be about sex. - [DARIUS] What's wrong with sex? - [SHEILA CHUCKLING] Mmm. Mm-mm-mmm. There's nothing wrong with sex. There's just other topics. Like what? [SHEILA] Oh, God. [LAUGHS] [ED] Where did you go? [ALL CHUCKLING] But you probably wouldn't know anything about that. Ooh. - [NINA CLEARS THROAT] - [CLEARS THROAT] Good night, Black people. - Good night. - Good night, sister. Oh, man! [ED] Well, damn. Yo, man, if that was me, I'd be in her car right now. - Okay? - You know. - Whoo! - Get back. [SAVON] You got your hand pulled there, like, so smooth. Maybe if your hand was a little bigger she could write your number down. Close your mouth. Y'all just mad 'cause somebody approached me. - No. What is the secret? - [SHEILA] Oh, oh, oh, come on. - [ALL CHATTERING] - Oh, Pookie, come on, man! - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] - [PHOTOGRAPHER] Yes. Come on, more. Yes. More. Bigger. Yes! That one's a cover. - Okay. Now... - [SHUTTER CLICKING] Um... this isn't curried chicken, and they were out of baguettes. Sorry. [SIGHS] Roger, come on, give me a break. This is only lunch. It isn't about the bloody lunch, Nina. I don't think this, uh, assistant thing is working out. I suspect you don't have the temperament for it. Perhaps you'd be better off on your own. [SCOFFS] Yeah, man, I'ma head on back over to the office, get the rest of my things. [CHUCKLES] Man, I can't believe I'm finally up out of there. Hey, but y'all don't worry about me. I saved up enough cash to hold me for a while, all right? Cool. Just hook us up in the dedication for the book, man. Man, look, just because you been there for me in the times I needed you, don't mean I got to put you in my book, all right? - Hey — - No shout-outs, baby, no shout-outs. [SPEAKERS: FUNK PLAYING] - Hey! - Hey. - Nina. - Sheila? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] - How you doing? - Girl, I need an Isley Brothers CD badly. Mm-hmm, I hear you. The CDs are in the back. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. - Yo, She. What's going on, girl? - Hey. What's up? - Chillin', man. What's happening? - Not much. - Y'all slow as hell up in here today. - But it'll speed up. What you talkin' about? Oh, shit. Hey, um, would you hold this for a second? - Why you gonna give me your junk? - Just be cool, cool. Ah, Al Green. You know you can't go wrong with my man Al Green. Darius, right? [SPEAKERS: SONG FADES OUT] Say, uh, y-you mind if I play you a little something real quick? I don't know. The last time you went on an impulse, you embarrassed the shit out of me. Look, this will be easy. I promise. Watch. [EXHALES] Yeah. [SPEAKERS: SLOW JAZZ PLAYING] [SPEAKERS: SAXOPHONE PLAYING] Charlie Parker. - I've never heard this particular — - Shh. [SPEAKERS: JAZZ CONTINUES PLAYING] It's kinda sad. Melancholy, maybe, but, uh, not sad. There's a difference, I think. Maybe you're right. My new information's on there. Okay, great. Here you go. Dr. Wax will have that Isley Brothers CD. - Thanks. See you later. - Yeah, all right. Bye-bye. Say, uh, you know, you and I should, uh, get together sometime and, you know, have some drinks. Um, I don't think that'd be a very good idea. Well, why not? It's just bad timing. Nothing personal. [CHUCKLES] I understand. - [STAMMERS] - Thanks for the record. Damn. - Messed that shit up. - [SHEILA LAUGHS] - [SIGHS] - When are you gonna learn? You move too fast. See, women like it slow and easy. Didn't I school you? [SIGHS] Yo, why don't you let me get her little address real quick? How would I do that? 'Cause it's on the check, man. - Why would I do that? - Because you're my girl. You supposed to be looking out — Come on, stop playing. Hook me up, man. - I'm not playing. No. - Why? Look, what if her man comes to the door? Her m — [WHISPERS] Her man. Damn, I ain't think about that. Her man. Yeah, you right. I'm buggin'. - [CLEARS THROAT] - [SPEAKERS: UPBEAT R & B PLAYING, FAINT] [CLEARS THROAT] [SCOFFS] Hey. Wh — W-What are you doing here? How did you know where I live? Look, I know it's a little strange for me just to show up to your place like this. Yeah, what did you do? Follow me home? No! No, no, I — Nothing like that. Well, um — Well, actually, I, uh — I got your address from the check that you wrote down at the record store. - [SIGHS] - Look, I know that wasn't very cool, and I apologize. But I got that CD you were looking for. Isley Brothers, right? Yeah. This — This is the one. Thanks. No problem. Wh-What? You trying to come in? Yeah — I mean, no, no. Yeah — Uh, sure. I mean, if— if you're not busy or doing anything. Um, well, y-you can come in. - You sure? - Yeah. - Hope I'm not intruding. - [NINA CHUCKLES] [SPEAKERS: R & B CONTINUES PLAYING] Nice little pad you got here. [NINA] I'm just house-sitting. Oh, a photographer. [NINA] Yeah. Dig that. It's nice. Um... why are you here? Said it was bad timing. And I figured if I asked again maybe you'd say yes. And if not that time, then maybe the next time. Till the next time became the right time. Ah. Persistence. You'd be surprised how far it can get you. [DARIUS] Reminds me of stuff Gordon Parks was shootin' for Life magazine. [NINA] Do you know a lot about photography? [DARIUS] A little somethin'-somethin'. I know that you have a great eye. So you're just like, uh, a Renaissance Black man? Poetry, music, photography. Think it was somebody that said something about Mozart. "The goal of an artist is to create the definitive work that cannot be surpassed." Guess you can say I kinda live like that. Well, that was actually George Bernard Shaw. - Now you trying too hard. - [CHUCKLES] Mmm. Okay. I'm beginning to like this. - Um, well, uh, don't like it too much. - [CHUCKLES] Check it out. Couple friends of mine are having this get-together tomorrow night and, well, I want you to come hang with me. Maybe we can start to like this together. Hmm. So, what, are you asking me out on a date? - Again? [LAUGHS] - [CHUCKLES] I guess that's about the size of it, yeah. - So... - I don't — I don't know. Aw, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look. Don't make me start bringing more CDs up here, okay? 'Cause I'll start bringing you Prince CDs. And you know how that brother likes to pump out four, five albums a week. - Oh, please. - I mean, I'll be here up every day - just all in your face. - Okay, okay, all right. - I'll save you the trouble. - [DARIUS CHUCKLES] Yes. I'll just come by about 8:00, 8:15 tomorrow and get you. - Okay. - Cool. Hope you enjoy your CD. Thanks. Hey, um, the next time you decide to just, um, stop by, you should call first. 'Cause I know you wrote the phone number down. Yeah, you right. I got your number. Listen, the last time we was over here, no disrespect, the food was crazy. Those constant and annoying references to my wife's cooking — [ALL CHATTERING] Here she comes. Be quiet. Here she comes. Here she comes. [SPOUSE] Don't be talking about me with your microwave-cooking ass. [ALL LAUGHING] [HOLLYWOOD] Troy, and then she gon' come out here with carrots. - [SAVON] That's right. - Do I have two big front teeth? - Is there somebody — - Get you some better carrots. - [ALL EXCLAIMING] - You can't see as it is. Fuck y'all. I'm about to bang out some wickedness out of you, boy. - [DRUMMING] - [ED] Bring the levity back. - We gotta get something going up in here. - [SAVON] Oh, don't start it up. Come on, now, Savon. - [ALL CHATTERING] - [ED] Bring it back. Exercise that. - [CHATTERING CONTINUES] - Come on, man. - No, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila. - [CHATTERING CONTINUES] [ED] Oh, man. [ALL EXCLAIMING, LAUGHING] [SHOUTING, CHATTERING] - Don't come over here with that. - Whoo! [HOLLYWOOD] That's enough. Go over there! Quit! Get out of here. Quit it. Quit fucking around with them spirits. You gonna get everybody in here pregnant. You fuck around and get us pregnant with that shit. - Take that shit to Flynn, Sheila. - Baby, Flynn get it on! - Don't worry about Flynn. - He can — He can keep it on. [ALL LAUGHING] You scared? - Scared of what? - God. - I know Jesus. - [LAUGHING] - God is a woman, honey. - [ED] Ooh. [TROY] Okay. [HOLLYWOOD GROANS] All righty, then. No, no, no, no, hold up, hold up. God is a woman. Look, D. - We don't get it. Know what I mean? - [LAUGHING] - We with you and everything, but, damn. - No, no, hold on. If you ever chased a woman, you know that women have a certain power, a certain sexual thing that renders men totally incapable of functioning. - Am I right, Von? - That's right. [DARIUS] I mean, that shit drives us to distraction. That's right. - Destruction. Look at that kitchen. - [DARIUS] Okay. - Go look in that kitchen. - [ALL LAUGHING] A male God would never allow a creature made in his own image - to get jammed up like that. - Uh, wait, excuse me. But why are you trying to impress your date? - [LAUGHING] - I ain't trying to impress no one. [SHEILA] 'Cause you know you wouldn't even believe that. He's just telling the truth. Savon, break it down for those who don't understand what I'm talking about. Oh, hold on. Hold up. Let me break it down so it can forever and consistently be broke. - [DARIUS] Okay. - [TROY] Oh. - All right? - [SHEILA] Speak on it. Go ahead. Now, when a man gets a hard-on, you know where the blood comes from, right? Know where the blood comes from, right? - His brain... - Mm-hmm. - ...and his feet. - And his feet. - True. - So, A... he's stupid, and B, he can't run. [ALL LAUGHING] Only a woman God thinks about shit like that. - [SCREAMS] - Whoa! That's how she got you, right? - That's it. That's what happened. - That's it. [CHATTERING, LAUGHING] - [ED] Damn! - But no, see, that's some bullshit. 'Cause I got it now. I got-- I figured it out, I figured it out. - [SAVON] This has become a regular forum. - What, what? I'm for real. [TROY] We getting ready to have some Hollywood philosophizing — - Yes! - I can't wait. Think about this. Anatomy. Now, if God was really a woman... y'all know how God think. She'd have put the dick right under the chin. [ALL LAUGHING] - Take care of her business — - [TROY] You are sick! - What? Aw, man! - [CHATTERING CONTINUES] Hey, it ain't — Hey! Yo, yo, can you get some chips, man? I'm sick of y'all. Y'all trippin'. Y'all sure know how to treat a person. I was 15 and my dad gave me this old Topcon when he was in the navy. - And ever since then I've been hooked. - [CHUCKLES] You shoot, but what you know about writing? "I gather up each sound you left behind and stretch them on our bed. Each night I breathe you and become high." Ho-ho! - [LAUGHS] - Check you out, girl. That's yours? - No, it's Sanchez. I'm a lifelong fan. - Mmm. She makes me wanna burn my notebook. Aw, no. See, it's about reaching your level, not hers. I thought it was about the definitive work. Yeah, well, Mozart was the exception. Like Bird. - You have all the answers, don't you? - Mm-mmm. Just all the questions. - You're cocky. - [LAUGHS] - It's cute. - Aw, cute.

All right, so I wanna know all the details. How big, how long, everything. Girl, look at you! Well, unfortunately, I have to live vicariously through your sex life, Miss Nina.

[SAVON] Troy. Troy. Savon, I am so tired of your bullshit. - Troy. Would you just wait a minute? - Stop. [TROY] You always said you never wanted to be labeled as trifling or tired — - Trifling? - Guess what. You fit the bill. Does this house bespeak a person who is trifling? - Darius. Go get your tired-ass friend. - [SAVON] No, you keep Darius out of it. How you doin', Troy? Don't wait by the phone, Negro. If you would stop being selfish and save some money, we wouldn't be going through this shit! Savon, get it together! - What? - [VEHICLE DOOR SLAMS] We were supposed to go play some pool, remember? I know that. Ooh. Let me ask you something, bruh. Think you with the woman you supposed to be with? [LAUGHS] That question implies a belief in destiny, like some cosmic love connection. I'm not convinced anymore. Come on, just answer the question. - You asking me if I married my soul mate? - Yeah. [SCOFFS] Depends on which day you ask. I dig that. It doesn't really matter anymore, man. You're with... who you're with. You just gotta try to make it work. [SIGHS] Yeah. Real deep, Von. Real deep, man. Well, you know, people with profound insights on life know not to get married. And those who do... ought to know that marriage is what you make it. Fly. Fly. Wait a minute. This is about that girl, Nina, isn't it? - What you doin', man? Can I get my shot? - No. This is about that girl, Nina, right? [CLEARS THROAT] She jacked you up, didn't she? Yeah, she jacked me up. Ooh, man! Dude. I mean... it defies description. She put the Vodun, the Santería, the Yoruba, all of it. - She put it on me, man. - [LAUGHS] Next morning, I got up and made breakfast. You made breakfast? Yeah. I was in there cooking. Wait a minute. You cooked what? - Cheese omelets. - A cheese — - A cheese omelet? - Yeah. You better put your name on that. That's better than Michael Jordan's comeback. Best thing since Michael Jordan's return. I'm serious, man. So what are we talking about? Think she's your soul mate? No. Mm-mmm. I just said the sex was good, that's all. [GRUNTS] You know, this ain't no love thing. - Just kickin' it. - Okay. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, well, uh, one truism in life, my friend... when that jones come down... it be a motherfucker. [CHATTERING, SHOUTING OUTSIDE] - I hope you cleaned up. - Why? I'm not tryin' to find any bobby pins and stockings and some old makeup. Girl, please. Rarely do I divulge the location to the secret bat cave.

We used to, um, be in a... We used to be in a relationship and I just haven't seen him in a while. Hey, uh, that's cool. We were close once. You know? Um...

Damn, Sheila. Look, why does it have to be about sex all the time? I really like this girl. Okay, we went out, we kicked it. Dinner. Everything is smooth. It's so convenient for women to think that all we wanna do is bone. But sometimes a man just wanna be held, you know. Cuddled a little bit. "Hold my back, I'll rub yours." You know?

Like for instance, you know, on a Sunday, I always go through all the lights. - Don't nobody stop me. - [BOTH LAUGH] There's some benefits to this car. I'm telling you. For instance, when I wanna go to church, I always get up front. Every time. Yeah, because they probably think you going to a damn funeral. That's what I'm saying, but I ain't. I'm just rolling. Who's your friend, man? - [SAVON] Tracey? - [DARIUS] Yeah. Oh, she teaches the class next to mine. English. Yeah. - English. - Mm-hmm. What? What? I work with her. [SCOFFS] "I work with her." Okay. Darius, she isn't my girlfriend or anything. I work with her. Mmm. All right. What? Come on, man. You know what. I mean, you married. What are you, the fucking Moral Majority now? - No, I'm just saying — - What's this about? I mean, Troy's a good woman. If my memory serves me correctly, you were the one who told me not to get married. All of y'all told me not get married. - Who? I said that? - Yeah, you. Don't be saying who. You. Damn, I did say that. But I also said the Commodores would get back together. - I mean, who knew, man? - Look, man. Let me tell you something. [SIGHS] People grow apart, right? People change. But, see, you wouldn't know anything about that. - What you talking about? Yes, I would. - No, you wouldn't, Darius. Because the last relationship you been in that lasted longer six months, my brother, was — was, um... was never. - Are you ki — Felicia. - Ne — - Felicia, yes, Felicia. - Ne — All right, Felicia. So, I maintain, when you get your wife, you advise me on mine. That's just it — all y'all running around, jumping, hopping, skipping, diving, falling in love and shit. Falling in love ain't shit. Somebody talk to me, please, about how to stay there. Do I love my wife? Hell yes. Is she here? Hell no. All right, man. All right? As far as I'm concerned, all of y'all can step. Hey, man. - I think you need a hug, Savon. - [SAVON LAUGHS] So, where are you taking me? A little set. You know. Whose set? Some friends.

Love is what you make and with whom you make it. - That's it. - [CHUCKLES] Yeah, well... I think I messed up twice. You'd think by now I'd have a little more insight, man, but... I don't know, man. I don't know what to think. That, my friend, is your problem right there. Physics, this shit ain't. It ain't supposed to make sense. Love, passion, it is what it is.

[JOSIE] Darius, it's Josie. Oh, hey. What's happening? Look, um, Nina told me not to tell anyone this, but... fuck it. - What is it? - I thought you should know. She did a shoot for Vibe magazine and it worked out really well. Well, good for her. - And since you-- - Look, why you calling me anyway? Look, she 's on the noon train tomorrow. I thought maybe you should see her off. - Well, maybe not. - Well, you do what you wanna do. I just thought I should tell you. Yeah, well, thanks for your concern. - [SCOFFS] - [RECEIVER HANGS UP] [LAUGHING, CHATTERING] - Stop. - [TROY] You can't play. Hey, Darius, who was that? [SIGHS] Oh. [SIGHS] [TIRES SCREECH] [PA ANNOUNCEMENTS, INDISTINCT] Shit. [PA ANNOUNCEMENTS CONTINUE, INDISTINCT] All aboard! What's goin' on? [GROANS] [GASPS] Are you all right? Nina! - [CAMERA WHIRRING, CLICKING] - [NINA] Very nice. Give me that smile. There it is. Nina, here's your, uh, tickets and itinerary for the Chicago shoot. - Great. Thank you. - Don't worry about it. - There you go. [GROANS] - All right, cool. - Thanks. - You're very welcome, sir. So, let's see this — this masterpiece. - Stand back. - Mm-hmm. - You might hurt yourself, bruh. - Oh. That's it right there. And you know the book-signing party is gonna be real nice. [CHUCKLES] Oh, sookie sookie sookie, now. - [DARIUS CHUCKLES] - Man, this... That's a jacked-up picture, though. Why you gotta talk about the picture, man? Jacked-up picture. [LAUGHS] Why you gotta say something about my picture? Congratulations. Mmm? - Thanks. - I know it's a dream come true. Mm-hmm. And an old one, man. An old one. That's a nice dedication. Yeah. So how come, uh — how come you never called her? Well... I wrote a bunch of letters, but... I thought it made me look like a fool. Never mailed any of them off. Yeah, well, I — I would have paid some mad money to see your ass running through Union Station. Yeah. [SIGHS] Damn, man. Had you not been sucking on them cancer sticks, you'd have caught her. I'm cool, man. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [SPEAKERS: FUNK INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING] Excuse me. Can I see that? Sure. Thanks. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Hey. Next up, our next poet is... Our next poet is a virgin to the mic, but I'm sure you'll feel her just the same. Sanctuary, welcome Ms. Nina Mosley. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [SIGHS, CLEARS THROAT] This is, um... something that I've been working on for a while and I was hoping that a certain someone would be here tonight. But I don't see him, so... I guess I'm gonna get it out anyway. It's funny what you can do in front of a room full of people that you can't even seem to do in front of one person. "It is the color of light, the shape of sound high in the evergreens. It lies suspended in hills... a blue line in a red sky. I am looking at sound. I am hearing the brightness of high bluffs and almond trees. I am tasting the wilderness of lakes, rivers and streams caught in an angle of song. I am remembering water that glows in the dawn, the motion tumbled in earth, life hidden in mounds. I am dancing... a bright beam of light. I am remembering love." [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [CLEARS THROAT] Look, Reg, I'ma gonna talk to you, man. All right, cool. Thanks. [SNIFFLES] - Nina Mosley. - Give it up! [CHEERING] Nina! [CHUCKLES] Long time no see. Yeah. I, uh, enjoyed your poem up there. Look, I know that there's been a lot of mistakes, and we both made 'em. I apologize for my part in that. And all that — that nonsense in the past, I don't give a shit about that anymore. [SIGHS] I never stopped thinking about you. I want us to be together again. For — For as long as we can be. As usual, your timing couldn't be worse. You always want what you want when you want it. Why is everything so urgent with you? Let me tell you something. This here, right now, at this very moment is all that matters to me. I love you. That's urgent like a motherfucker. Yeah. - How do we do this? - I don't know. - I live in New York. - I don't care. All right, so... what's the first step? We can start by getting out of this rain. - Ooh, yes. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] I love you.
