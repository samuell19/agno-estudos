Every year, tens of thousands of people come to the middle of the desert to create a temporary city of epic proportions. They build magnificent structures, art installations, and vehicles that test the boundaries of form and function. And when the week is over, they burn it all down... and leave without a trace. But why? Why do humans do any of the things we do? We create lines, symbols, city-states, relationships, experiences. What is the meaning of life? How do we come to exist? And is there a reason? This controversial event so closely resembles the chaotic yet poetic structure of life itself. What is the meaning of life? What do you live for? Hmm. We came to get a partial answer to that. The burning man festival is reborn anew each year. It starts as an empty playa and soon fills with life. From, basically, it's just plain nothing on the desert to something what we're seeing now. My first impression was that somebody came out here, you know, months and years ahead just to be at this thing, man. You know, they burned this down last year. As in life, the birthing process is not always easy. People wait in line for hours to enter this new world. Welcome home, everybody. Some people are just so fried from getting here, you kind of have to be gentle with them. This feels like home. You can be yourself here. You can be exactly who you are. Everybody will love you anyway, just like home. [ Bell rings ] I traveled nine hours a day here, and I know I'm finally home. Burning man is family. Burning man is home. Burning man's a way of life. It's a lifestyle. This is the playa. This is our home. Out there... that's the default world. That's where you got to deal with all the crap, you know? 90% of life is crap. This is our little getaway. It's kind of the thing you look forward to all year. People busy themselves setting up camps, art installations, their home for the next week. Participants make this temporary community a true city indeed. There's a hospital, post office, police, department of public works, public transportation, an airport, a radio station, a newspaper, a census, and plenty of nightlife. Honestly, it's just a huge fucking party in the desert. A lot of people get the notion that it's just everybody coming out here, getting drunk and high. My concept is you come out here and you see all this different art and everything else. You see everybody's inner self being displayed, and that's what it is to me. In the center of black rock city stands the man. The temple of transitions completes the city. It's the largest temporary structure ever built in the world. The temple of transition is the complex of temples. The one all the way to the left is birth. The next one is growth. The one behind the central one is union. The one to the left of that is decay, and the one all the way to the right, up front, is death, and the central tower is for gratitude. It symbolizes the spirituality of the playa. Many people come to burning man in search of answers. It's the best place ever... A place you can truly find yourself. The collective conscious capsule asks the questions so many ask of themselves... Who are you? What is the meaning of life? I don't think I have a goddamn answer for that. Once upon a time... I was sent away to china, and I trained in the shaolin monastery. And I thought, "hey, what's the meaning of life there?" Not a single monk there could answer me. I came back to california. Hung out with all the hippies I could and did all the drugs I could. Even those hippies and their drugs can't tell me what it's about. That's a funny thing. Many people have more questions than answers. The human experience is the question mark. Can you design a computer that will understand why it exists? If we knew the meaning of life, this booth would not exist. We always act like we know everything, but actually, we're just poor little humans. We actually don't know anything. I'm just here to get more answers to my questions, but I know I'll leave with more questions, which need more answers. I think asking questions is enough. I was asked yesterday who I was. She said, "who are you?" I could not answer that question. This place, it really lets you tap into a primal part of yourself and take down some walls, which... basically, it takes down all the walls. I'm no longer a virgin! [ Bell rings ] Ultimately speaking, I think everyone is in search for their own identity. I'm gonna go out into that playa, and I'm gonna find what I need tonight. Maybe people struggle with why they are here because they don't know how they came to be. The playa existed before anyone came to inhabit it. How did all of this come to exist? That's a rather big question. I find it hard to articulate my thoughts. All right, okay, how we got here, I don't think anyone will ever know. I think it's a total mystery. Let's talk about it in a smaller sense. How did we get out here on the playa? In a car. I was pulled here because, you know, this is something that... that god wanted to show me. Burning man, for me, is the most spiritual thing. Like you and me, the air, the earth, the fire, the forests, everything is god. God is everything. I'm ready now to open my third eye. You are god. I am god. We are all god. The universe is a fractal, and we're all wandering through the fractal, and we're kind of lost. I would never want to define myself by a "specific" religion because that is just really... It takes away from too many opportunities. It is not just hindu or buddhist or christian. We still connect with the same cells of buddha and Jesus and muhammad, you know. The cells just keep reproducing. We all have somewhat of that in our souls. Actually, around the time I could think about what is god, that's the same time I stopped believing that there was a god. I did a little bit of research, and I found that other people that didn't believe in god, and those people were called atheists. I'm an atheist by faith. I have faith that there's no god. And then I started to question that, and I said, "well, I don't know there's no god." Both: Brad is the man behind the curtain! People at church are going for the experience. But Jesus kind of had it right. I found that my connection to divinity was through the goddess. I believe in god, and I think everyone's worshipping the same god. Every one of us will look at the original deity as a different aspect, but he loves us all equally. Many people have studied this. Many people have thought about this. Learned religious figures throughout history. Wars have been fought over this. So it's a very important issue. The most... worst violence in history has been over that question. But then I stumbled across another theory that we shouldn't be looking at what may or may not be. We should be looking at what we don't know and exploring the possibilities of what... of what we could know, so I became a possibilianist. When I realized that god really was a too abstract and probably archaic notion that science has helped us to rid ourselves of. A superstition. Mm-hmm, a superstition. I mean, science states that we're all made of atoms. Atoms are all made of three subatomic particles. Those subatomic particles are made of even more particles. But they've proven that those particles are made of pure energy. That means each and every one of us is a being of pure energy. What if we here, today, instead of asking, you know, "what is a supreme being?" agree to say, "being is supreme." How did we come to exist? Oh, well, monkeys. [ laughing ] yeah, monkeys, yeah, tadpoles. Yes. And it started off tadpoles. And then we evolved, and then we evolved some more, and now we have a large brain and small testicles. People think we came from monkeys. I beg to differ. I don't know. Where do you think we came from? I came from my mama's vagina. Existence of it... it's like a force that pushes all the time to manifest itself in whatever way it can, however it can burst through into existence. It seems to be this driving force with no real design or purpose other than just to exist. I think that creation is evolution and vice versa. I think that we're just not done with creation necessarily. And that's why we're evolving. So I think that's what's been happening since the beginning. Somewhere along the path, it was time for this experience. I think we are as significant as all other beings in the universe. I don't think there's some... Humans, in my opinion, are not the penultimate evolutionary species. The skull has a limited capacity for squeezing more stuff in there, so, in that regard, we may be one of the last, or certainly one of the later, evolutionary beings in terms of the cerebral cortex, but I think there's lots of evolution that we don't understand. We're significant to one another, but in the universe, no. We're like micro, micro, little bits of dust. It's all good... all, all, all good. It's all for us. It's all... the whole universe is for us... for me, for you, for... for us. Amazing. I feel like the world... Earth, the universe... it's like our playground. It's what god gave to us... to do whatever we want with it, you know? The possibilities are truly endless. I mean, we're just very tiny things in this universe. Like, "tiny" doesn't even describe it. We're like a germ on a germ's ass in this universe. And I feel like the more people realize how small they are, the more they could really experience their life and get the most out of life. The all, the infinite, the source, god, whatever you want to call it. The source... it's to create more of itself, or it's to try out things. It's to try out a festival of art with 50,000 people. It's to try out having sex with a loved one. It's to try out giving birth. It's to try out being a child. It's trying out everything and create a better existence. Each one of us is a little point of little, tiny hair on the wholeness that is source. Whatever you believe in is right. Listen to what your soul tells you. I consider burning man to be like boot camp for the soul. Burning man is a place where I sacrifice my body to give my soul blessed. This is a wonderful, wonderful place. Everybody is so unique but all the same in relation to the desert. Everyone's just trying to get by. Doing much better here than I was last year. It took me three and a half days to get into it. Once you get it, you get it. We have one life to live... Or so it seems. And though we can't remember, we live in our dreams. We live in our minds... or so we think. And yet our bodies are not our home. Our bodies are a tool... a tool that we use to see, to feel, to preen, and to abuse. The strength of our body comes from our mind. Mind over matter... the secret defined. The secret we know, yet have unlearned, because of society our heads have turned away from that which is master of all... The one and only, the human soul. Like, we really... yeah, we have souls, for sure. Our body's just a shell. I believe that we are spirit beings, that we are consciousness in a vast form, and that we take on this particular kind of human form as a way of learning very specific lessons. The arc of the soul is a long, long, long arc. Sometimes we incarnate into different spaces, places, planets, different kinds of bodies. There's definitely something that is present throughout our whole body, and I believe that's our spirit. I believe we have a soul. Does it go on forever? I don't know. It could just like burn up in the big central star out somewhere in the universe. We could dissipate and just, you know, our vibration will be picked up through... echo out through the universe. We are here to experience that which our souls were curious about. We're on a bit of a mission here on this beautiful earth. You know, we're spirit. You know, we're in these bodies, having an experience, and it's not all... it's not what it appears to be. I mean, there's so much more going on that we... we don't let ourselves see. There's spirits everywhere. There's life everywhere. We're not alone. We never were alone. There's always the question about whether or not we're the only intelligent beings like ourselves here. That may not be true and probably is not true because the universe is so big, there's so many possibilities, that there's likely to be other manifestations of consciousness and intelligence and spirit like we have, so we're certainly significant in that we're the well in our part of the universe. I'm... I am an alien in every sense of the word and whatever sense you think that is. We are not alone in this universe. There is life on all different kinds of levels all around us, stuff that we can see and stuff that we can't see. There are multiple dimensions. We live in one dimension. Our senses can only experience this much in this dimension. So that's all we get to experience. Do you know how far that goes, you know? And you know, there's so many overtones to this reality. There's so many dimensions. It's ridiculous. Like, who knows how... like, there's infinitesimal amount of dimensions. How could there not be? Show me the smoking gun. We're all aliens. [ laughs ] We're transplants. We're fucking zombies just running around trying to kill each other in different ways and put each other down, and it shouldn't be like that. Look at how people behave, you know, to see what they really, deeply believe. We may never know how we came to exist, but we can explore the ways we choose to live our lives and why. Your perception and the way that you deal with things that make your reality. Reality, I guess, would be an agreed-upon perception by the majority. [ Indistinct chanting ] Reality is the movie. It's basically what is projected on the marble. That is your reality. It can be altered. It can be faked. But I believe it's not fake. It's not "the matrix." It's not a fake thing. Reality is about perception. And every time you put yourself out there and go through some different barrier, you realize, when you look back on where you were, completely different perspective. We have a lot more choice than we give ourselves credit for for what things will become. That's where the meaning comes in. Everything looks inevitable in retrospect, and, like, it must've been part of some divine plan, but in the moment, there's always a choice for things to go one way or another way. Burning man? Burning man is to escape having to figure out all these other people's realities and just try and create one unified front of a reality and know that everybody here, no matter who they are, they support this place and they care about you. As in life, the inhabitants of burning man create a collective consciousness that rules the land. [ Indistinct chanting ] The mission of the burning man project is wrapped around the 10 principles, and just clarify intention. And I think, sort of all of these combined, we really do. The culture is a pattern. And it's a way of life, and... so, in that, we've come a long way. We were just a little group with our own incipient ethos, and we've just become increasingly aware of who we are, and, as we've done so, we've gained a perspective on the greater world. Anyone may be a part of this community. They welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in the burning man community. The principle of radical inclusion certainly came out of the experience of looking around and realizing that we had corporate leaders here, we had café workers, we have truck drivers, we have beekeepers. People from all over the world to experience burning man. There are times I don't feel I belong here. The artistic creativity is beyond my scope. The intellectual creativity here is beyond my scope. I still feel involved. I still feel part of the community, and I'm thankful for it. They're just such accepting people. It's open-minded. The message is creativity. It pushes your boundaries, and if you're working towards something, you know, if you're a shy person, it'll help you build on that. By the end of the week, you might not be the most outgoing person ever, but it definitely will help you become more comfortable being in front of a crowd or talking to strangers or doing whatever it is that you really need to work on because these people, they heal you. The radical acceptance and inclusion is amazing. There's always that moment where it clicks and you get it. The burning man community encourages the individual to discover, exercise, and rely on his or her inner resources. This is survival camping, and it's very cool. People get depleted. They get tired. They get hurt. They... they just get beat down in this environment. I got the name "boy scout" because I was prepared the first year as a newbie. I was prepared for anything. And it turned out that I was prepared for nothing at all. [ Sighs ] The meaning of life... is to survive, isn't it? What sucks about life is being in a world where you feel you need to be a certain way in which to survive, and seeing so many people not surviving hurts. Burning man, for me, is about the simplicity of the playa and how there's very little here, and you have to be reliant on yourself... radical self-reliance. Bring what you need. If I were to sum it up, I would use the term "survival" as being the meaning of life, but that's a pretty vague term. I don't think that really captures the essence. Walking different paths, seeing different possibilities, and creating those possibilities through our existence and our walking of those paths. We're biological organisms, and we... our purpose is to procreate and survive. So we do whatever we can to survive. Life's very simple. You eat, drink, sex. Sex is a big part of the meaning of life. Well, it's one of those things that makes life a little better. Mm-hmm. It's how people mix together. Mm-hmm. And become other people. Yes. And then they mix together and become other people and then other people and then other people. And then the ones that, like, mix together the longest are the ones that last. The longest. Reproduction... not just human beings. All life... all life is here on this planet to reproduce, to keep it going forward, to keep life evolving and continuously becoming whatever it is meant to be. We are a cosmic accident most likely, but we... the dinosaurs were here, and they kept reproducing until they got wiped out. Is sex meaningful? Fuck yeah! [ laughs ] Are you kidding me? Sex is the reason why every human being on this planet is here. Our drive to populate has made human beings the dominant life-form on this planet, and although... and as small as this planet is, it's still... we're still dominant. Sometimes it's just sex. Sometimes it's just athleticism. Hmm, interesting. A workout. The meaning of life, when you're a guy, is to be with as many women as possible and not let your current girlfriend find out about it. If she goes down on you. [ laughter ] If he goes down on you. [ laughs ] It's a physical way to express love, and it's not always about that. I'm not saying you have to be in love with somebody to have sex with them, but I think that it's really important. I think that, because people are so repressed, generally speaking, it's important. That's one of the coolest things about burning man. It's like one of those places where it's just okay to do those things. Temptation is everywhere. Love... that's when it's... That's where it at, man, right? That's true for me, anyway. I don't think random sex is meaningful. I think random sex is fun. Meaningful sex is meaningful. Sex is meaningful with the right person, and it particularly was this morning. If sex wasn't meaningful, they wouldn't have put such a great desire and such pleasure in it. Sex is very meaningful. It's at the point of release for the individual as one of the few times that your mind is actually cleared. And I think that's one of the things that drives people for that pursuit of sex. They may not realize that it's that moment of having a cleared mind. You can be enlightened when you orgasm. I think one of the most important aspects of relationships is the sexual chemistry that the partnership has and the freedom to explore within one another. And trust. And the trust. Most of all through that. Yeah. The sacred connection that you get. It's a sacred... something sacred. It's a sacred connection, exactly. And it doesn't, you know, obviously, in, you know, many cases, there's no sacred connection, but when it is meaningful is when you're having that... sacred space connection. ...with your partner that you, you know, are sharing the love and that feel with. And it just... floats. Integrating their spirit and their minds and their bodies and their senses. Senses represent the passions that we have in our life and how can we exult those feelings in creative union with all that is, and maybe finding that union within a dance of lovemaking that is life itself. So you can always feel satisfied with yourself, whether it's orgasmic sensuality or whether it's personal. It is pleasure, but it's... I think it necessitates a discipline to be able to distance oneself from just the flashing lights and some tits and ass and whatever, and be able to focus on something longer term. The meaning of my life... has changed dramatically since last year. Last year I was deeply in love here with a man I cared for very much. And I had another man waiting for me at home. It's a natural drug. I mean, well, I mean, the question is like... using it to try to fill a void. Some people do use it to try to fill a void. Yeah, which I've done that for a while, no. That fucked me up pretty good. I don't have either of those lovely men anymore in my life. However, I do know that loving both of them and loving everyone around me... is giving me what I need in my life because, by giving my love, I get it back 10 times. To be honest, I live so I can have a connection here to someone else. I am my own person. But I have a deep feeling and need to have someone close here. I think the meaning of life is having a soul mate. Ah! Ah, mommy! You live for love. I live for love. Yeah, that's true. Like, that's what everybody searches for. And connection, you know what I mean? How does... And experience and adventure. I think we all really want connection, and that's part of the meaning of life, too, whether it's to another person or to, like, a universal spirit, and truths we all know. And I think that's what keeps me going. It's just a feeling like I will eventually connect to a universal source and a hard connection with other people. What do you think is the meaning of life? 'Cause I'm sure you have ideas. I do, and it's part of why I asked you to marry me tonight. I got married last night, and I met my wife here in 2009 during evolution, when we've evolved, and now we've surmounted a rite of passage. We're unified. I love you so much. Burning man's changed my life. It saved my life. You saved my life. Emily, I'm so glad you're my wife. I love you. I used to live excluslivey... exclusley... Exclusively for my girlfriend. But that ended a few months ago. And right now I'm just seeking myself. Trying to find some meaning to replace her. What sucks about life is... love that was destined to be but is not fated to be. Unrequited love... that's what that means. I just want to kind of vent, I guess. It is thursday, technically, but... wednesday night, and I don't know. It's weird to feel lonely at burning man. I didn't actually think it could happen or feel that way 'cause you are so connected with so many people. But I'm feeling it. I'm feeling the loneliness, and it's kind of tripping me out. And I've asked the universe, like, is this good for me? Do I need to feel this? And I should not... live totally for anyone else. But, I mean, at burning man, I find... I want to find connection. Like, I want to find people who want to love as much as I do... or someone to love as much as I do, I guess. I still got some part of me that feels unfulfilled. The meaning of life is to find true happiness, and that is also the most difficult thing for us humans, somehow, to do because we are a self-sabotaging race, for some reason. Why do I suffer unnecessarily? Why do I have to go through all these things that I don't like? The meaning of life is to experience polarities, to experience great joy and love and its polarity, its being, but only if you know pain do you know love, and as cliché as that sounds, it's all love. Experience... the duality... the woman and the man... the sun and the moon, the faraway galaxies and our inner self. Of course I've known a lot of pain in my life. But I've gained a lot of love. And... the pain never leaves. But... it has its place. You know, I don't think that it's an accident that there's so much beauty in the world and that there's so much chaos and ugliness and destruction, too. I believe in polarities and... that, you know, to have light, you need darkness. To have darkness, you need light. To have colors, you need both. Everything about love makes us bigger... less fearful. It allows us to be vulnerable. Um... and sometimes when we're scared, we're not... We're not able to give, um... We're not able to give people love when we're scared because we don't want to be vulnerable. So we protect ourselves. We get smaller. We get more narrow. But when we stop being scared, we can give more love. That survival instinct does tell us to do the house and do the kids and protect that... Protect that nest, and maybe that's one of the things that's changing with the evolution of our consciousness is that, not that we won't still have those things but that maybe we'll understand that those things are achievable and now we can... go on to something bigger? Yeah, we can layer on more complexity. We can care about our family, but also care about our community. This community values creativity cooperation and collaboration. They strive to produce, promote, and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that enable such interaction. Even if we're... right, some people don't, but some people have more food than they need. Once people bust out and start sharing, you know, like, "look", "we all have it," then there's plenty for everybody. The reason why there's so many humans on the earth is because we've learned how to be cooperative and how to... to develop, I guess, a team mentality. The tribalism and all of that was very successful. There are a few moments when things weren't working perfectly, but we all kind of stuck together and made it happen. That's what community and life is about. The only reason that this exists is because we are all able to put our resources together and do what we do best and make it happen. That's how it works. Like, when you get a group of people, and it's like, "oh, I'm" a great builder, " or " I'm good at "... I don't know... " cooking food," and "I'm good at this," and like, you get them all in one place. It's tapping into everyone, what they do best, because we're all amazing and we're all awesome and we all do great things, but once you figure out what you do really good and you make that... You bring that to the plate, and if we all do that and then we all work together... we've all learned a lot about working with people and how to integrate everybody's ideas and everybody's creativity in a way that is beneficial to the whole as well as the individual, and it's been rocky at times. I'm not gonna lie. But we all came together, and we made this happen as a community. The things that are most meaningful in life are community and finding the space within yourself to be able to provide and to rely on that community. It takes a lot of people to do a big project, so we had to learn how do you make a flamethrower. You know, how can you... we had to keep asking people 'cause we didn't know. We'd never done it before. So it ends up being a big project. You're not a spectator. This community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. [ Up-tempo music plays ] They believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. They achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart. We just pull all the people together. You know, "hey, we've got a crazy idea." We can say, "well, what if we did this?" and "can we do that?" And then suddenly it's like, "oh, this is gonna work," you know? So, we build the infrastructure, and there's core staff, paid people, contractors, volunteers, volunteers, volunteers, volunteers who just work to set the framework, and then everyone else shows up, and they've been working their butts off just as hard as we have for whatever their thing is. So, you know, it's this collective thing. We all do it to each other because, you know, because we love it, but we all build this city together. Burning man has created this community for me. I get to be a doer and radically participate, and I learn more here in like two weeks running a project than I do at my job in the real world... "the real world." They are the folks that build the playa for us. You know, they build our temple, they build our man, they build the fucking city for us. The simple fact that this species can talk has given us the ability to say what we do or don't like. Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. I think what it means to a lot of people is inclusion, self-expression, and... doing what you enjoy. I think that should be probably 52 or 53 weeks a year. [ laughs ] Not just one week. You know, the whole reason any of us is even here is just because of the... you know, the joy of creation. Some sort of consciousness and potentiality could manifest, and therefore has, and into this abundant diversity of everything, and then we, as people and creatures, have then created things on top of that and on top of that and on top of that, sheerly for the... you know, just for the sheer joy of creativity. It's like an excuse to expand your horizons a bit. This is the biggest expression of freedom that I think has ever existed on the planet earth. Occasionally you see where god touches the ground and you get beautiful art, and you could see the hand of god in that beauty. What amazes me most about the imagination of people to create such incredible art projects... every year, things that appear just totally blow my mind. We all dig each other's stuff so much that you're really introducing them to a little glimmer of their own divinity, not to be all hippie-hoo-hah about it, but you know, to know that you can do things in the world... manifest, create the universe around you, be with other people in a way of your choosing... I think that's one of the most powerful things. For art to be any good, it has to confront the unknown. When I make my art, it's a very sacred thing for me, and I feel more connected to the divine at that moment than any other moment. The muses are a manifestation of her... her... her being on this plane. So, to be in this and to see this crazy energy that's here is pretty luscious and lovely and inspiring. Lives become where we try out things. You get to create things and, you know, we write a book or we create a piece of art or we have a thought about something, and that gets created in the universe. You can create and we create and we create and create and create, and there are no limits. Truly there are no limits. Why do we get create art? I think that's just for physical enjoyment. We're attracted to lights and to shiny things, pretty things. Some people like ugly things. When I come here, I don't make any art at all. I only drink from the well, and I am grateful for this oasis. Art is a business, right? I mean, people pay money to go to a museum where I work. I get paid to work at a place where people pay to go on their day off... right. So people come here... if you come here to experience the art, what do you get? What do you get for your money? The burning man community is devoted to acts of giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value. People are doing things that don't make sense financially, but they're investing in it, and it's beautiful. Doesn't matter how much money you have. The love and the sharing and how people help each other and how things are magical here. The idea of burning man is to bring an idea of no cash, sharing, family, and gifting. You start off in little centers and you work out from there, and people will come here and kind of absorb what's going on here and take a little piece of that into their little corner of the world. I don't think that we're ready to step away from monetary transactions. But being able to gift... something, and it's not necessarily an item. It can be your time. Your insights. Gifting those things, I think, helps bring people around to a slightly... helps them shift their perspective a little bit. Unfortunately, now, we've gone so far off the track by modern culture and covering the planet in concrete that we've missed a very important turning point. This is an intersection. Right now, I think, as a species, we face probably the biggest challenge that we're ever gonna face... not whether we're gonna survive or not, but whether we're gonna actually evolve. You want to work 9:00 to 5:00 and make money for a fucking corporation that doesn't give a fuck about you and slave away and save away and become society's little bitch and not think for yourself, not have one solid thought that actually comes from you and live your life being told how you're supposed to be. I kill myself with the way I live... drinking, smoking. You know? But 51 weeks of the year, it's so hard. Is money meaningful? It's meaningful if you need a sandwich. [ laughs ] To eat and survive. Yeah, if you need to survive in the world, it's goddamn meaningful. If you're talking about whether a dollar means anything, probably not, but, you know, society says it is, and we live in society, so it does. The hard, driven pursuit for money, that becomes a problem. Society generally ends up being a tiered system, and I don't think society should be a tiered system. I think everybody should have equal opportunity. The community out here has really had an impression on me. There's really a sense of community, and the gifting economy is really cool because I think everyone here is just on such a same page here at burning man that you can think something that you need, and it will completely manifest itself in your life. Being part of this community and help people out, and I do stuff, of course, in return. Then that's what you get. You get whatever you want. I mean, I think, honestly, burning man is what you make of it, honestly. It's like what you really... as meaningful as you want it to be, that's how meaningful it'll bring back to you. One of the big meanings of life is giving yourself to others, and I think that's something that burning man has kind of made more apparent to me just because we kind of know that. You know that you feel good when you're giving and you're sharing and there's community, but it's amazing how you realize how connected everyone is, even though you don't think that you are. ♪ It must be free ♪ it's a right ♪ the water, air, and land ♪ do you understand where we're headed? ♪ People are willing to take you in and feed you and party with you, and that's a really neat thing, and you don't always find that in the default world. It's a change how it is as an adult, you know, up here, to see those other ways of gifting... all the, you know, the gifting kind of philosophy. It's amazing. It's so different. In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, this community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. They stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. They resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience. Works just because a bunch of power-hungry, selfish individuals who know nothing about sharing in life with others. 21st century is gonna be about resource wars. There's infinite resources for every person that's alive. People like war. Mm-hmm. Otherwise it wouldn't exist. If everyone said, "no, I don't" "want a war," how can it exist? Somebody creates war because they're enjoying the fuck out of it. People are a bunch of assholes. Sometimes, as a species, we do things that are just incredibly stupid. If we're gonna moderate our consumption, we have to find our satisfactions apart from... Apart from consumption. It's just fear that the other man has something that I want, and the illusion that what I want is actually something of value. There's a belief in ownership. There's avarice. There's greed. But I think that war is actually more exciting than peace. Yeah? Why? Dude, it's full of adrenaline. And that can be a great feeling. It's very self-righteous. It's power... it's powerful if you can shoot your opponent. War, I think, starts with defense and aggression, and that, you know, goes back to animal behavior, you know? Territorial, um... [ clears throat ] ...and protecting your own. There's always gonna be darkness in the world, I think. War is part of that. But we're diminishing it, I think. It's getting better. And I have faith that it will continue to. Life is too short to fight. Life is definitely too short. And we need to make this the best experience ever and realize that everything you learn here, we need to take back to our reality and make the world a better place because, in reality, it sucks. People hate each other, and there's too many wars. What sucks about life is the people that make it suck. We have the capacity to make things better for other people and other creatures and other things that exist here among us. It's like learning how to really appreciate the cake we're eating. Right now we're just snarfing it, and we're complaining. Fill your mind and not your pockets. [ Crowd cheering ] They value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state, and federal laws. "But if we truly combine the divine with the mind, we still find that this world, after all, can be kind, even though we are inclined to believe that mankind, with design, to be "confined to perpetual grind." We need to get rid of major corporations that are out there to profit. They're poisoning us through food. They're ruining our dna. [ Singing indistinctly ] Our economy is so bad, and so many people who used to have jobs don't have jobs anymore. It makes it a lot different when you don't have money to buy all the things that the corporations are forcing down our throat. There's changes afoot. I think the default world's gonna have to shift. It's gonna shift. Oh, shit! The shift's gonna hit the fan. [ laughter ] I really feel like right now we are on top of some sort of tsunami wave that we're just kind of riding on, and we'll see, you know, soon where it lands. And we're gonna co-create where it lands. We're definitely gonna co-create it. I mean, I think that that's what's the most important thing is that people are... the media and corporations and society... Like, that part of society... Does such a good way of, like, disattaching yourself from one another because they know the power of when we come together and of when we're aligned with each other, and so they do everything in their power to make us different from one another. We are all interconnected, so we all change what we all do, so it's like we all... we are all one in a sense, so we all affect everything. So, if we are not good to nature and good to, like, life, and good to one another and good to the earth, like, we are definitely not good to ourselves. [ Indistinct chanting ] We've gotten so lazy that we think the government should do things for us. It doesn't take a governing body over all to say you're doing wrong or you're doing right. I think everyone knows when they're fucking up. When we wake up to the realization that we're very high spiritual beings, we have a fragment of god within us, we can do anything. There's no limitations placed on us except the ones we place on ourselves, and that's what's so important about this is that we're showing the world that we can come together as a big, huge, gigantic group and function in total harmony. We love burning man because it's a slice of how society could be. I don't know if it could last more than two weeks in this idyllic, wonderful playa. But love your neighbor, be kind, don't be a jerk. Actually, I do know the meaning of life. Actually, you know the meaning of life. You don't have to look for it in some guru or some yoga pose or some chanting mantra and giving thanks to the east and all that stuff. That's all cool. That's all fine and dandy. But the universe doesn't think about things. The universe doesn't judge. It doesn't have ceremony. It just does. It is. So, I mean, it's cliché, but you are the change. So just be silly. [ Chuckles ] And love each other, you know, and fucking... I don't know. Just go fly with the eagle. Your meaning of life is what you contribute to the universe. Yes. It's "how can I better the universe?" That's fantastic. "How can I use the innate gifts that were given to me"... I totally agree. ..."to the fullest capacity?" And I've actually had this thought recently where people are always so focused on, like, their contribution having to be, like, on such a big scale. Mm-hmm. And I recently think, like, you just have to pick one thing... one thing you're good at, and you don't even need to realize how that's impacting. You just need to do it, and if everybody in the world just sticks to that one thing and everybody does that one thing they're good at it, when you add it all up, I mean, that's a shitload of things. [ laughs ] Yeah, that's a shitload of synergy right there, yeah. Yeah. Learn to love yourself because you're good! You're right! You're a human being! And you're here. And you're here for a reason. [ Inhales deeply ] You're a human being, and you're here for a reason. You're here to do something. Individuals have been known to change society. Yes. Usually at their own... They probably have to die first. We can make the world better. People had better wise up and start reversing the population explosion, or mother earth is gonna develop something that'll wipe us all out before we wipe ourselves out. Here today and gone tomorrow. Correct. Leave no trace behind. This community respects the environment and are committed to leaving no physical trace of their activities. They clean up after themselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than they found them. We're actually in, like, national parklands right now, so, you know, it's just "leave" no trace " really means " leave no trace." It's the largest no-trace event in the world. Two weeks after we leave here, the only thing left is a few tire tracks. They've even scraped the grounds with electromagnetic... I kind of feel like I'm fortunate... I get to do about four parts of burning man. I get to go to a very early part when I'm literally one of the first 50 people, 30 people to move out here, and now all of you people are camping in my yard... no. And then there's another week where we're doing a lot more building, a lot more building, and departments are starting to show up, and then there's the week of, and then there's the week after, and I do admit on like, monday, even sunday, when people start to just pull up their stakes and go away, I'm kind of like, "darn!" 'Cause, you know, you never get to do it all. But I've gotten used to that cycle, and that's natural, and in a way, each of those four sections has a lot to offer. You're like "the burning man." They're all... "burn the man!" And they're all going like this, all these things, to get the man burned. The creator went into the man tonight, and he was co-creating all along. He exploded in the heart and went back to the source, his beloved, passionate creator. It's very primitive. I think it's deep in a lot of people's hearts and souls. [ Fireworks exploding ] As the festival inevitably draws to an end, one is reminded that an unescapable part of life is death. The man burns, and we disappear without a trace. But we were here. But then ultimately, we are all just dust. What sucks about life... the death. The ending. Where they go when you die... I don't know. I think probably our energy stays put. Don't know if I believe in reincarnation or just... the fact that when you pass on, your energy stays around and becomes something else. "Now that you are gone, you "are everywhere" made me feel good about the passing of my parents and things like that. Um... but I sort of... when I go, maybe I'd just like to be dumped in the ocean and fed on by life or something. I mean, I want the worms to get me. I actually don't believe there's a heaven and hell. I actually think when we go underground, we just rot, you know? You know, it's great to be fucking alive, and, you know, when that shit's wrecked, you know, when it's snuffed out, it snuffs out. I definitely believe in reincarnation. I definitely believe we have old souls within us that we're re-living different areas of different lives. There's a continuity to being, without a doubt. We have too much to learn in one lifetime. I mean, you know, there's too much to figure out. So it takes time to kind of work out all the kinks. At the end, we all figure it out. And the whole point is to perpetuate ourselves and to keep living. And yet we're the only animal that will [grunts] when we get depressed. And I guess that's the next stage of it. And what this whole place means to me is that even though we are the only animal that will end its own life, we are also, to my estimation, the only creature on this planet that will do all of burning man just for the sake of it. And it's that wide spectrum between those two qualities that humans... all humans... share is somewhere in that gulf is maybe the meaning. To me, I feel like I'm at a point where, like, I wake up in the morning, and I'm just like, "why don't I just go hop in front of traffic?" I look at life as a pathway to death. I guess that's kind of pessimistic. I don't know what the meaning of life is. I don't know exactly what to do. The thought of suicide came into my head, and I thought, "why? Why live?" And then something told me to verbalize that. And so I turned to my friend meredith, and I said, "why are" we living? Why continue on with life if I'm so alone and things are so difficult? "Why not end it?" And she told me that the meaning of life is to have relationships with people and that even though it's disappointing and even though we hurt each other, that the point of life is to experience things from our own perspective and with other people and to share those experiences and those perspectives with one another because that's how we learn. And burning man fits in to that very strongly, I think, because we all come here, and people are open to one another. [ Sobbing ] sorry. I just came from the temple. I lost a dear one to me last year. We shared a burning man experience that was... it was horrible. It was nothing like any other year I've been here. This is a beautiful place, and I love everyone here. And he went home, and he hung himself. I was very grateful this year that there was a place like a temple where I can go, that I can leave him here, because this is where he belongs. I just came from the temple and lost someone very special to me this year, and it's... Burning man has been to me a spiritual-growth opportunity. I had a moment with a couple guys in the temple. And a gentleman had a death in the family. His father died. And I just sat there and comforted him for a while, and it really made me feel good that I was able to give my heart out and make somebody feel better about themselves. Mortality... you got to hesitate. You got to be careful. You don't want to lose that life. Life is beautiful. Enjoy it. Accept it. That's what this is all about. On saturday night, when the man burns, it's a big party. You'll find out on sunday night. 50,000 people... silence, serenity. It's so beautiful. If you would be so genuine as to reach out to those around you, to reach out to those next to you, and we can all be connected as the temple burns. [ Fire crackling ] It's all about the release. You know, whether it's joyful, whether it's sorrow... whatever it is, it's all about the release. And burning it is the way to release it. I think that's what we're all here... we're trying to do today. It's become... being like the phoenix, really... transform ourselves, evolve. Let that old part of ourselves die. Let go of things. I wrote something inside of a letter I put with my love's ashes. He passed away about four years ago. I put some of his ashes into the temple to be burned. I cast my grief here, and also my intentions for what I want to do next. It is like a rebirth. I feel like that's what I'm here to do. I know I'll never be the same. I think for me, it was a slow burn inside. It was as if all of the energy of the spirits are spiraling upward. Changing the winds of the world. Because of the way that we take the city down and put it back up again, we get to go through a full birth-death cycle every year here. I think one of the meanings has to do with cycles... cycles of life. As the temple and all of the... you know, the man and all of these very temporary, beautiful things remind us, life really is short, and there is no second chance. This really is it. So live it to the fullest, really, and love as much as possible. What happens at the end? You die, and all of a sudden, you realize that your whole life has been wasted. We all need to wake up to this. Immediate experience is the most important touchstone of value within this culture. No idea can substitute for this experience. Life is so short. Like... you should be passionate about what you're doing, and, like, you should be nice to people and, yeah, like, do what you need to do. Life is shockingly short. It's one reason I think I come to burning man... 'cause life is so tragically short. And you can miss the whole thing. Life's for living. Do it now. And it's really short, so, you know, might as well have fun. One thing I'm gonna tell you is that now is all you have. Appreciate the divinity of this moment. Now is all you have. Time is a construct that we apply to make sense of change, but all change occurs in the present. The past and the future are only concepts that make sense of this change. So enjoy, embrace. Now is all you have. Stop thinking about the future and the past and stay in the moment of now. And then it's so much easier 'cause the human brain always wants to go, "oh, man, look what happened to me." I think that if you spend all of your time searching for the meaning, then you kind of miss the point. If we're chasing something that we think exists, but we're not sure, we're not really living. Only when we let go of these possibilities and let go of the future or desires, that's when we start to live. Enjoy absolutely every single second to its fullest. Word! [ laughter ] This moment now in singularly time... it's such a wonderful, wonderful thing that we all have this moment to share. "Tomorrow will be too late to enjoy what you can today." All you have to do is try and help your neighbors, and everybody work together. To me, that's happiness. It reconnects you to the present. It makes the present meaningful. And right now we're all living in a world that is more meaningful than anything any of us ever experienced ever. What is the meaning of life? What is reality? Can we answer a question with a question? [ laughs ] What is it worth to you? What does it mean to you? Find yourself, then you go find meaning. Meditate, prayer, take care of yourself, take care of the people around you. We are here to create and live and have lots of experiences in life and share and love and eat well and make love and give love and share love with everybody in the whole world. "With this crazy life I live, I truly live." "I love myself right now totally as I am." Simply, the meaning of life is love. I think it's... life's about getting out there and making a difference in other people's lives. The meaning of life is to do the right thing and to help others. Life is about caring as much as you possibly can for everyone around you and feeling that inner connection between everything and then letting that flow as much as you can. I love everybody. I love you. I don't know who you are, but I love you. If everyone treated each other like the hotel concierge, the world would be such a great place. There might be just a little too much ego. Well, maybe one day we'll cut that out. Just connect. The meaning of life is to connect with and enjoy the people that we love and to learn our soul's purpose for being here and to be in service and to grow, explore, and have fun. To manifest yourself as the most compassionate person you could be, to stay present, to be kind and generous, to love, to dare to live your life, to go out there and have some kids, have a family, see things. Spread the message. Yeah, spread the message of life. Of love. Of love. Of love. I think the purpose of life is trying to reach your full spiritual self, to respect all things... people, the earth, and the animals, trying to reach your highest level and be happy with yourself and to learn to love yourself. I feel like, just, the overall meaning of life is just to live it. Make it good. Make it big. Make it, you know, as good as you can. Step it up. Reach into the imaginal... Source something in the imaginal realm, and then physically manifest it in 3-d reality, and then participate inside of our own creations. And that is the definition of a creator... a being that can create worlds that didn't exist before... something from some place of knowing that is unseen, and that is what we call our imagination. Burning man, for me, is a sea of creative possibility... the play of the imagination and, at the end, the attempt to kind of compensate for a lot of the things that are limiting us in a larger culture. And then hopefully, we can take these connections, this inspiration, these experiences, back into that world and, you know, potentially reform it. We should exalt creativity. We should exalt community. We should exalt a sense of, like, being the best of who we can be. I think that people here really shine. They're friendly, they're engaged with each other. They feel alive. So remember you're alive. Remember life is short, and don't waste your time doing meaningless things. And try and find something that you love and people that you love to do it with, and live as actively and passionately as you possibly can. The meaning of life for me is love. Life is about loving yourself, loving other people, loving the universe and the world... the earth that we live on. I think that the meaning of life is love. I love you. While I know you're strong, may your journey be long. And now I wish you the best of luck.
