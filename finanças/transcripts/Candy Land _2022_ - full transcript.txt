What? Son of a bitch. Well... You kinky freak. What... did you leave me? Hm. Show me, show me, show me. Hm. So Maxine, you didn't see nothing weird, nothing suspicious, huh? No, just a normal Tuesday, Rex. I already told you. All right. One more time. What the fuck is wrong with you, Rex? Don't you fuck with me, Riley. Nora, what the fuck is wrong with him? I was peeing. I got my period. I bought a tampon, and he was just fucking dead like that when I found him. You don't say. Can you just leave, please? She didn't do it. What, did you have a fucking hunch? There's my hunch. Oh. Look, I'd love for it to be that cunt more than anybody else, and you know that. But she ain't good for nothing but giving mango cakes. She ain't no killer. What do we do now? Nothing. They took the body, bring it to the morgue, bury it in a few days. Life goes on, Nora. Who was he? Who fucking cares? How's Riley? She's fine. I think she just needs to be left alone. Who's this? She's from that weirdo cult, the 13 somethings. My cousin went to a few of their meetings. They think they're gonna leave for Heaven before the rest of us. So what are you doing here? They made her leave, I think. I don't know. I just didn't think it was safe to let her stay at the stop alone, especially after what happened. Hm. Okay, who's got something for me? On the TV. Yeah, mine's there too. Okay. Night. Hey. Hey, pumpkin. You snored. Yeah, you too. Levi. Hey. Let's go eat. All right, give me a second. Yo, Riley! Let's go eat. Go away. Mm-mm. All right, so we got root beer for Sadie, -Sprite for Livy. -Thank you, baby. And Coke for Remy. -Thank you. -No problem. You're gonna let me order for you, right? -Yeah. -Okay, good. You ever had a Coney? No. What is it? She's never had a coney! It's like, uh, it's like a hot dog, pretty much. Okay. You've had a hot dog, yeah? No fucking way! Okay, uh, it's like a sausage. You're gonna like 'em. But my grandfather once, in under an hour, ate 21 of them bad boys. -Oh, here we go. -No, no, no. He did, he did. Yeah, he did, and they put his plaque on the wall over there -Oh, really? -Yes! He did. For years. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. What happened to him? I mean, he died, like everybody. I'm sorry. It's okay. So how long have you worn this getup? Since I was a girl. How long have you worked at the truck stop? For a little while. What? Nothing. Come on, say it. What is it? Just, how can you... how could you do that? I hate that question. I'm sorry, I don't-- No, it's okay. I don't think too much about it. It's just a way to make some money for now. You? I mean, you don't think I've worked a job for six bucks an hour? I've done that. Turn one trick, make a whole day's pay, you know? It's kind of hard to go back after that. I just like to party. -Slut. -You know, you make a little dough. It's not a bad gig. But you're gay. No. You know, I can blow the horn, but, well, I like ladies too. We're together. But it's, you know, it's whatever. What about you, Remy? What do you wanna do? I don't know. Are you gonna go home? I can't go home. Why not? I just can't. Okay? I can't go back. So I got someone coming over. You're gonna have to wait outside the room for a little bit, okay? Okay. You know, I can talk to Nora and probably get her to let you stay another couple days while you figure out what you wanna do. Thank you. All right. I'll make it quick. Hey. Hey, baby. Still here, huh? Why don't you come wait inside. It's okay. I like it out here. Thank you, though. Oh, come on. They don't like you hanging out out here anyway. Come on. I'll make some tea. You're so pretty. People must say that to you all the time. They don't? Well, then you are hanging out with the wrong people. Sadie's a nice girl, huh? Yeah. She's really nice. They're all really good kids. And they take care of each other, you know? 'Cause it's rough out there. And it's nice to have someone who has your back. But we have a rule. You stay, you work. But if you work, we take care of you. Hey, don't be so nervous. I'm not gonna hurt you. So what do you think? You think you wanna stay with us for a while? Good. Stand up for me. Look at you. Where do they even get these dresses? Where is that store? I mean, is it like a pioneer thing? It's so pervy. Don't be ashamed. You really are an angel. I have to ask, have you ever even kissed someone before? No. Not so bad, huh? So, this whole lot is exit 17. There's three stops like ours on route 66, but if you're heading west, this is the last stop for any quality action. If you wanna unbuckle the bible belt, this is the place to do it. Good, clean, old-fashioned, drug-free pussy. And dick. We have a bit of a reputation here, and we're so proud of it. Hey, you know, Riley's mom, she worked exit 17. Gave it the nickname, too. Candy Land. So there's four parts. The pit. Think of it as a neighborhood. Yeah, you'd never just walk up to any old house and knock on the door at 3:00 AM and be like, "Hey, how's it going? You want your cock sucked?" There's rules. If someone wants company, they'll let you know. The first is simple, back-in parking. Next is more of the same, if they flash their lights. Remember, they're watching for you too. Next is the bathroom cruisers. Levi? So your bathrooms are for your thrill seekers, you know, not just about getting off, but about not getting caught. Stalls around here are most active in the afternoon and the evening. I usually post up in the stall at the end, against the wall. When someone comes in, you can tell a lot by their body language. Do they go straight to take a piss? Do they bust through the door and take a shit? Or do they come in casually? And if they do, I start to tap my foot. If they tap back, then it's game on. You know, and a lot of these cats are not truckers. They're married men, and proud of it too. They're just looking for a little excitement. Who's that? That's Rex. Don't worry about him. Not unless you're Levi. Mm-hm. Babe, the radio. Right. Go. So we use these. We're listening for our code words, commercial company, angels on the airwaves, lot lizards, or anyone who says they're headed for Candy Land. I-9, this is Hot-Karl heading for Candy Land. Any lizards running today? 33. So once they put out the signal, we have 'em flip over to a private channel, and there, we make plans. Hot-Karl, what did you have in mind? And no matter what, you always use one of these. They'll beg you not to, but don't be stupid like Levi. Or for an extra 40 bucks, you can always -ride bare back. -Stop. -Do not listen to him. -It's... So what do you think? You ready? Wait, now? No, I'm kidding. Relax, we're not gonna start you here. So, this is your room. Liv was nice enough to move in with Sadie so that you could have it for yourself. Do whatever you want with it. Make it your own. And I got you something. Why don't you try it on. We'll let you get settled. Wow. You look like a real woman. How do you feel? I feel okay. Great. I'm so glad to hear it. We have a guy coming to see you. He's a really nice man. He's super gentle. We don't let guys in here who aren't, you know, people we trust. It is okay to be a little nervous and shy. That's fine. It's normal. But I know that deep down inside, there's a woman who is dying to come out. So don't be afraid to enjoy yourself. You're gonna be great. And you know I'll be right next door, so just knock if you need me. Okay. You a Goodbuddy? Sure am. I'm looking for a little...fun. All right. Well, what you looking for? What's on the menu? Well, we've got 40, 60, and 80. Fine as you are, I'd hate myself not saying 80. Well, you wanna slide in the back and let me join you? It's a little, uh, tight in here. Why don't we, uh, go back over there, someplace quiet. All right, here work? Yeah. Then what are you waiting for? You gonna whip that thing out? Why don't you come help me with it. Okay. You fucking make a sound, I'm gonna slit your fucking throat. Do you understand me? Yes. You understand me? Yes, yes, yes! Hi, there. May I come in? My name's Father Phillip. What's your name? Remy. Remy? I hear you're a Christian. How cool is that? So am I. Do you say your prayers every night, Remy? Yes. That's good. You can never get too old to say your prayers. May I take a seat next to you? My gosh. You are so beautiful. They told me, but I had no idea. I rushed over here to meet you. Oh, you don't have to be scared. I couldn't hurt a fly. Is there something I can do for you? Oh, you're so sweet. What if I did something for you? How would you like that? Okay. Great. Well, why don't you lay back. There you go. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, Lord. Yeah. I ask for your forgiveness. Yeah. Cleanse me. I receive your grace. I accept your forgiveness and your sacrifice to pay my debt. Cleanse me. Cleanse me. Amen. Hold on. You okay? Yeah. Come here. It's all right. It's over, okay? ♪ Happy V-Day to you ♪ ♪ Happy V-Day to you ♪ ♪ Happy V-Day, dear Remy ♪ ♪ Happy V-Day to you ♪ What is this? It's a cherry cupcake, for the girl who just lost her cherry. Oh, yeah.

I'm just glad you're okay. So what do you think? You think it was the same guy from the bathroom? Stands to reason. He did say he'd carve my throat up. Seemed like his thing too. Hey. How's your back end? Why, just swell, Rex. Thanks. So what now? Are you gonna call it in? You sure he's cooked? You don't wanna call this kind of thing in, it just creates more problems, more eyes on the lot. You got the same son of a bitch that carved up our bathroom John, and I'll bet dollars to donuts it is, then you did a great thing, Levi. You did a real great thing. Now we just gotta clean it up. Fuck. Face looks like scrambled eggs. You weren't fucking around. Yeah, what was I supposed to do? Well, what could you do? You got nothing to worry about, Levi. No one's gonna come looking for this psycho. Why don't you grab his feet. I'm glad you're okay, Levi. I'm glad you're not hurt. Thanks, Rex. I care about you, Levi. I've got feelings for you. Okay. Claudia's a good woman. Cooks, cleans, knows when to keep her fucking mouth shut. But she just doesn't have that wow factor. You wow me every time, son. Every time. What the fuck are you doing?! Kiss me. Rex, stop! No, not tonight! Not tonight, no! I just thought... What do you mean what am I doing? -What are-- -What... Can we, can we please just... Fuck you! Please, can we please just go move the body, please? -Please? -Fuck you. All right, just, just, let's go. Can we go? You've got some fucking nerve. ♪ So tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Go away. What the fuck? God damn it. Sadie! Hi. Turn around, Jonah. I remember you. Did you come to show me that cock? Take me to God's kingdom? We're here to see Remy. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. It's okay, I'll meet you over there. Would you like to put on some clothes? Psst. Hey, cutie. What are you doing here, Theo? I could ask you the same thing, but I won't. I didn't ask to withdraw. I want you to try and hear me, okay? Your mind has been poisoned, and I know it is not your fault. I recognize that, I do. Your mother and her beliefs, they were not that of the apostles, but of her own. She instilled them into you, and I need you to see that. That is why you were asked to withdraw. Theo, my mother taught you how to see, and you turned on her. I did not turn on her, Remy. -Yes, you did. -I did not. She became ill, Remy. Ill. And when that happened, she changed. Her mind changed. She became barbaric, with no mercy for the dissenters. Now I've made peace with her since she left us, and I am grateful for the life that she showed me, and that is why I feel I owe the same debt to you. We are not here to cleanse the dissenters of the world. We are here to cleanse ourselves of this world, and when we are cleansed, then we will leave it. Theo. Your mind has always been so small. Ye shall tear down their altars, Theo, rip down their sacred constructs, and burn them, cut down the images of their gods, and erase their memories of this place. You know this. You are so lost. We must be the ones to drive the stakes into their hands and their feet, for they cannot do it themselves. We must cleanse the world before we can cleanse -ourselves of it. -Stop it. Stop it, please. I just came here to tell you that we are leaving. The other elders and myself, we have decided that it is time. When? Tomorrow morning. And I know that we asked for your withdrawal, and I know that our beliefs are not the same, but deep inside you, Remy, there is a light so bright. And I know that. And so does the Lord. And we just thought that we owed you the opportunity to come with us. You know where to find us. Say goodbye to your sister. Hey. How are you? Good. Good. Theo says we're leaving soon. Are you coming with us? I'll think about it. Come, Jonah. It's time. It's time. Let's go. Father. Father...I am ready for you. Use me. Guide my hands to do your bidding. I am ready. How come...your legs are-- I shaved today. Alright, well, yeah, but like when it's, like, cold, like, my hair just grows back so fucking fast. Like, yours are all smooth. Look at mine. These are nice. No, I have strawberry legs. What?! What's a strawberry leg? I have, like, black dots on my legs, so when I shave, and it, it's just, like, it always looks hairy. It's really unbecoming. It's really-- Hey. Only you would notice that. Hey. Is everything okay? Everything's okay. You want a smoke? No, I'm okay. Thank you. Okay. We'll break you down though, soon enough. Oh, Sadie-bug, let me get your cigarette. Hey, you feel okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Heads up. Oh, man. I just sat down. I'm gonna go get something to eat. No, no. I need to eat. I need-- Don't do that! And my fucking feet, too. Well, who's gonna go? I'm not going. Hey, why don't you go down? Riley, fuck me. Come on, she's not ready for the pit, okay? -Sadie. -I'll go. Stop. Hold on. Yeah, I can do it. Yeah? -Yeah. -Are you sure? Mm-hm. What'd I tell you? -You got a rubber? -Mm-hm. Yeah. You've got this, girl. Go. You've got it. There she goes. All right, let's do half and half. Money's in the cup holder. You ain't touching it 'til you're done. What, you just gonna sit there? Come on. Mash your motor, honey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? -I was-- -No, no, no, no. I'm not wearing no raincoat. There's an extra 40 in there. All right? So quit your fucking lolly-gagging and give me that bean cap, right now. Woo, woo! Hey! Get over here, you little whore. Oh. Hey, babe. So how did, uh, how'd it go? Good. It went good. What is that? Remy, what is that? Shh... Just witness. I'll meet you outside. Meet me at the car. Hello? Are you okay? Hey, catch. Thank you. No problem. How are you? I'm good. I heard that some guy came by the motel for you. Yeah. Is that, like, your dad, or your brother, or something? You got, like, a boyfriend or something? -No. -No? That's cool. He likes to think that he's, like, my dad, or my older brother, but he's not. Yeah, I was just asking. Looks like you're up. Hold that. You can have it. I'll save it for you. Okay. Uh, hi. Hi. Uh, to tell you the truth, I haven't done this before, and I really don't know what to say. Why are you here? Uh, well, let's see. Well, I suppose I'm lonely, just looking to feel the touch of a woman. But now you must be cleansed. Um, is that part of the game? Salvation is not a game, silly. Clothe yourself in him. Make no provisions of the flesh to fulfill its desires. Um, you know, I think maybe this was a mistake. I think I'm gonna be leaving now. I'm so sorry, sweetie. No, no. Let me do this for you.
