One day, if you're unlucky enough, you'll be confronted by the truth. You'll see your life in front of you and you'll realize just how much you hate it. When that happened to me, I decided to do something about it. No, please, no. I decided to become the person I could be. - I don't give a fuck. - Please, stop, hold on. Of course, once you reach for the brass ring, well, you better hold on because the rest is out of your hands. You know that line from Isaiah they always quote? Yo, where is it? "He who dwells in the land of the shadow of death upon him the light hath shine?" Well that's a fucking understatement. That's only the half of it. As you'll notice good old Isaiah never really gets into how hot that light can get. Or for that matter how deep and dark that shadow really is. Well let me tell you, it's one hell of a trip. Please be seated. Yes? Rabbi Fernstein? Yes, can I help you? I hope so. Yes, what is it? I'd like to join the chevra kadisha. The Chevra Kadisha? I'm new in town, I just moved here. I thought that maybe you could speak to them on my behalf. It's completely out of the question. Oh, I see. If you don't mind my asking, being with the bodies, doing the taharas it can be quite, disturbing. I'm sure it's nothing I haven't seen before. Really? And what line of work are you in? Finance. Surely there must be some way? To tell you the truth, in all the years I've been here they've never taken on anyone. I'm sorry I can't help you. What if I spoke to them myself? I wouldn't advise it. - Why are you so upset? - Well, here it is. 20 times now. It's a nonsense. The point I'm trying to make Marvin, is that if we don't all die, we'll miss everything. Oh, what is he talking about again? Money, money, money. Par, pardon me. Yes? How did you get in here? Through the front door I... The, the front door was open. Well it shouldn't have been. Please lock it on your way out. Yeah it was the groundsman, you know, he's always leaving the doors open. - I'm, I'm sorry. I was speaking with Rabbi Fernstein. Rabbi Fernstein, why? You're the fella in banking? Yes, how did you know? Fernstein said someone in banking was asking about us. But didn't he send you away? He said he sent you away. Yes, he did. If he sent you away what are you doing here? I wanna join the chevra kadisha. Why? Are you dying? I don't think so. Is that a requirement? Look Mr... Sheldon, Sheldon Kasner. Sheldon Kasner, I don't want to be rude, but chevra Kadisha material you are not. The meek may inherit the earth, but I don't think this is the place for you. You're wrong. I don't think so. You don't have the stomach for it. Well, what have you got to lose? I mean, it's not like you got an army of Jews breaking down your door to get in. Okay, Sheldon take a pew here. Here. - Ah, I give up. Sheldon, tell me, you read Hebrew? Your ghusl? I do. And your family, the hours they won't be a problem? I'm not married. I lived with my mother, but she passed away recently. You took care of her? Yes. My brother's got his family so he ah-- That's good, that's good. And your job, you have time? - I don't work. - Wait a minute, you said you were in banking. You made that up? No, no, that, that's true, I, I left. What to be in a chevra kadisha? Of course not, I want to make a change in my life. Change in your life? Marvin, you've gotta admit, that's what we were talking about. Alright, you'll do a tahara with us. And then maybe he'll leave us alone. Sheldon, close the door please. Sheldon, tonight, please. Like that, here. Slowly move down the body. That's right and slowly down. That's it, push. A little harder. Why are you here? Why am I here? I was tired of my life. It was time to make a change. You were tired? Yes. Look, maybe we were born in the dark, but it wasn't last night. I don't understand. What don't you understand? You want us to believe that because you don't like you life, you stopped being a (speaking in foreign language in the big city to come to a small town to clean up other peoples shit? I was a loans officer at the Hebrew Loans Bank. Then perhaps what I would suggest instead of the chevra kadisha is a new line of work. I'm looking for more. What a coincidence, so are we. Well, well, wait, there's more. Please, there, there's something else. Yeah Happy Hannukkah. My bosses tried to kill me. What? Okay, we're listening. Now this is two million dollars. I know how much it is. Alright, just calm down would you. Good morning. - Don't tell me to sit down. - What the fuck are we doing? - Don't tell me to sit down. - We didn't take the winners cards, just listen, stay with me. We didn't put it in his lap, right? Yes, right. Why is Sam even gonna worry about us? Right, right, right. Well, what are you gonna tell Sam? I don't, what are you gonna tell Sam? I don't, you figure out what the fuck to tell him. He's gonna kill us. He'll probably rip my fucking heart out, is what he's gonna do. - Alright, alright. You're gonna make me... Don't, leave it, don't worry about the phone. Hey, what do you know about Morrisberg Steel? Nothing, what is it? Nothing, don't worry about it. Hey listen, we're in a bit of a jam. Think you can give us a hand with something? I should have known right there that something was wrong. In my 10 years with them, they barely spoke to me. Not since they took over their father, Moshe Lightman Which meant they were either seriously desperate or trying to play with my head. I could never be sure with them. What is this screen? I've never seen it before. - Nevermind that, just watch. This was the network banks used to wire money around the world. But it didn't make any sense. We were such a small operation. I couldn't imagine why we would be on the system. We're looking for a transaction. I can't tell you how it felt. Like somebody else's life. All these strange numbers for accounts I never heard of before on menus I didn't recognize. Gentlemen. Sheldon, grab your coat. What's happening? It's nothing, just let us do the talking. Nothing, it's not nothing. Where are we? We're just gonna see on of our-- - Financiers. - But, what financiers? You know, the ones that give the money for all those loans that your write. That money comes from the Israel Fund. I don't understand. Not exactly. See, these people give us money and we-- And we give it back. You launder money? No, no. We launder money. You're criminals? Who else if not for criminals? Jesus Christ. Hello, gentlemen. So it turns out that while I was writing loans for the local Jewish community, my bosses were getting rich taking in money from criminals and giving it back as legitimate, interest free loans. How long has this been going on? 20 years. 20 years? You, you mean your father? He, he was a... Taught us everything we know. So this place, what was it? Where were you? I'm still not sure. Why did they bring you there? I was about the meet the prince of darkness. The overseer of overseers. The enforcer for the Jewish underworld. Who was he? Sam Goldberg. I never heard of him. Nobody has. - Hey, Sam. - Hey, Sam. Who are you? He's nobody, he just works for us. So, what's going on, Sam? Is somethin' wrong? Morrisberg Steel. What about them? How much does that make? It was like a church. - Maybe... - Only for money. It's where bag money came to be redeemed. Because if you were a criminal, your biggest worry wasn't staying out of jail, it was figuring out how to spend your millions without being spotted by the tax man. And the Hebrew Loans Bank where I worked, it was one of those places where cold, hard cash traveled from the dark into the light. And some of that money had mysteriously disappeared. Two million? - Two million dollars? - That's impossible. The transfer should have gone through days ago. Well, why the hell didn't we hear about this earlier? Apparently, they were unable to reach you. Our phones, they've been out since yesterday. Yesterday, Sam, please. Give us a little time, we'll figure it out. It's probably just some, some inputting error. Well that's comforting. Sam, you don't think that we would do-- I don't know what to think, Jake. One thing I know is I don't have it. So these people tell me. And believe me, they've looked for it. Sam, we'd have to be nuts. Maybe. But who knows? You're father Moshe, it would be unthinkable. But him I've known all my life. You, you're a different generation. No values. You don't go to shul. You live the high life. You're hungry. People do things. What is it the goyim say? White is the gate, and broad is the path that leads to destruction. Because I've known you so long, I've promised them it was a mistake. You have 48 hours. Don't make a fool of me. He said he'd be up here. Why did I have to come? Until this over we're joined at the hip. Sam's probably watching us right now. Don't look around. Even one of us tries to run, we're all dead. Run? You think I'm gonna run? I would if I were you. Well, why don't we call the police? The police, brilliant. Why didn't we think of that? Well, what about to protect us? If we don't find the money, nobody's gonna protect us. Come on, he's over here. Tell us what you did with the fucking money? - C'mon. - You tell us. You must have seen the codes. You must have figured it out. Even dad knew you'd catch on eventually. Why did you think he hired you? He figured you'd be too big of a coward to ever rip us off. I've never stolen anything in my life. Alright, fuck this. No. Come on. - We're gonna drop ya. - I haven't... - We're gonna drop ya. - No! - How's it feel, huh? To have a 2 million purse? - No! No! No, I don't know where it is. - Where is the money? - I don't have any money. - Tell us where it is. - Please. - Shut it. Tell us or you'll drop. - I can't... - You can't get... So what happened? You told 'em where the money was? I didn't take the money. Well, how did you get down? I was saved. Saved? By who. - Give it to us right now. - I'm gonna fucking drop you, right now. - Believe me. - Where is the money? - Talk. - I don't know where-- - Where is it? - Where is it? - You little fuck. What the fuck is that? - What? - What the fuck is that? It's a phone. It's your fucking phone. - I got it, I got it. - Guys? - Get it out. Shut up, don't say anything. Yeah, hello? Hey, shut up, I'm on the phone. Hey, Sam. - Hey, Sam. - How are ya? - It was Sam. - Oh, we're just hanging out. - Shut up. - They found the money. - Where? - You, you found it? - Come on, boys, please? It had been there all the time. It was just an innocent little inputting error. Please? - You mean - Alright? - from a computer? Yep, from a computer. Please. - Hold on. - But hanging there, I saw something. Let me up. I saw everything. I mean, everything, my entire life. If you could call it a life. I don't understand. What was wrong with your life? What was wrong with my life? I was a 40 year old man who was afraid of his own shadow. 40 years like I didn't exist. Like I was invisible. But hanging there, I, I realized something. I'm tired of being scared. I wanna live. I know it doesn't make sense, but I figured this was the place to start. So tell me, these hoodlums, you're done with them? I am. I say, yes. Now you'll find out what you're really made of. Sheldon, come. Easy, easy, nice. Very good. Sheldon, give me your right hand. This knot is nearly 2,000 years old. Since the Kabbalah your forefathers have used the same knot. And two, three, four. Slow, and put this on here. And alright, good, very good. What's he doing? Ah, the pottery is to protect the eyes from the bright light when he wakes up in the promised land. Incredible. What about the twigs? They grows as staffs. To abandon all worldly possessions. It's the essence of rebirth. They're reborn with nothing but the sackcloth on your back and the twigs in your hands, which will grow into powerful staffs. That's what I call traveling light. That's what it is that they are. The preparation for the passage. Removal of all earthly possessions. Where they're going, they won't need them. - Well, hello. - Hi. Come right in. Sit down. And here you are. And you know what to do. I sit and read until Harry shows up to relieve me. And you don't ever, ever leave the body until he is buried. And Jew must be in the company of other Jews. Goodnight. Did somebody die? That's the question. That start to his last mission. He very well disappeared without trace into the netherworld of Beirut's southern suburbs. The only publicly confirmed information... How are you feeling? Come on, Shel. Mm, real matzah balls. Who made this? Who do you think? Amazing. What's amazing? What else can we do? Can't let her starve. It's not right. And you're medicines. Do you have enough for the week? Thank you. This is Sheldon, our newest member. I know your face. Organized crime... You're sure you don't come before? Have continued their search... - I'm sure. - For the second body... We are sure. I'm afraid we are going to go. So soon? Well, I'm afraid so. We have many, many deliveries. We'll see you next week. The money is there on the table. Take all of the 80 cents. 80 cents? Sheldon? Here, take the money. That's alright, you can keep it. 80 cents, God forbid I should lose it. Leave it, Hy. She is old, she doesn't know better. Sure, that will support tahara and Mrs. Graunbaum. Sheldon, tell 'em. Earth to Sheldon? Huh, I'm sorry, what? Tell 'em we should take money for the tahara. - Money? - I said, leave it. I don't understand, what are you talking about? Who do you think pays for the chavurah, hmm? And the electricity? A synagogue, I would think. You would think. It's a small Jewish community. The synagogue does not have that much money. I'm telling you, we should take money for the taharas like a business before we go broke, and we won't be able to help anybody. God protects us this long, he won't stop now. God looks after those that look after themselves. That's very original. In what's now shaping up to be a double homicide. Our sources inside the department have also hinted at the possibility of some sort of organized crime connection here. And so, as divers continue their search for the second body, I'll it back to you, Dan. Execution style murder as Stuart Lightman, the local businessman who disappeared late last week. Also missing is his brother, Jake Lightman as well as Darrel Zimmer, former employee who worked for the brothers. But all we've been told so far... Sheldon? Are you there? Sheldon? Oh, hi. We are sorry to disturb you. There is a tahara to be performed. How did you find me? It's a small town. We tried a phone but there was no answer. Here Sheldon. Sheldon? Are you alright? Sheldon, are you alright? Hey? - Sheldon? - Sheldon, are you alright? I hope you're awake. Finally. Chicken soup? It smells good. That's good because the soup is not for you. I don't know what happened. What happened? You passed out. Gin, gentlemen. I guess I haven't been feeling well. I just-- - Don't worry, Sheldon. It's a good sign. Don't worry. A good sign? You are beginning to feel it. Feel what? The power, it's getting into your blood. You wanted to know how it felt. Now you're beginning to see. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Harry. Sheldon, let's have a talk. First time I met you, I think, no, no, it's a mistake. Now I see something inside you. I see the truth. The truth? For 2,000 years, the chevrah kadisha exists. Through wars, famines, genocide. But what Stalin and Hitler couldn't kill is almost dead now because people forget. That's why he sent you. I don't understand. He sent you to save us. Me? Who else if not you? Why the face? You're, you're expecting a lot. So my coming here, you think it's an act of God? I know. Now you have to work harder. So you can teach others. - Well it's about time. - Jesus Christ, Morry. What are you doing here? Oh, my God. What happened to your face? What happened to my, I suppose that's your idea of irony? Your boss, Jake, happened to my face. That's what happened to my face. Jake, he's still alive? That's an understatement. He says that you killed his brother. He says he wants to know where you are. Oh, my God, you didn't tell him, did you? Believe me, if I had known, I would of. Lucky for you I didn't get your message till this morning. Are you sure you didn't tell anyone? Yes, for fuck sake, yes, I'm sure. So did you Darrel? Did you kill Stuart? Kill him? God, no. You know I would never-- I didn't think so. So nobody followed you? No, Darrel, nobody followed me. I'm not a complete imbecile, you know. I just have one for a brother. So, so what is this place? What, what are you doing-- Look, it's okay, just, just relax. Have a seat. Where, on that? I'd rather stand. This place is a petri dish. And you're the one who's terrified of germs. No wonder you look like shit. It's okay. I'm fine. Everything is fine. Fine, everything's fine? The police are looking for you. Everybody thinks you're dead. Your crazed boss just beat me up. You know, I haven't gotten beaten up since I was 12, and I think he cracked my goddamn bridge, Darrel. Now what's so fucking fine about that, huh, Darrel? I know, I know. Darrel, what is happening? Say something. You know when I was having all those problems at work? - I swear to God. - No! Stop it. - Where is it? - Where is the money? - No, alright. They dangled you off the, I mean, how did you get off, how did you-- For once, just shut up and listen to me. - You little prick. - C'mon, kid. - Where's the money? - Where is it? - C'mon, where is it? - No, please. - You little bitch. - No, you big baby. - No, No. - That's it. Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you where the money is. You better not be bull shitting us. No, I'll tell you. Please don't drop me, I'll tell you. What did you tell them? Well, what do you think? I, I told them what they wanted to know. But you didn't have the money. Darrel? You? You? Of course I didn't tell them where it really was. I, I guess I told them where the money really wasn't. And then, well, voila. Fuck me. How much? - Two million. - Two, two million dollars? You're enjoying this, aren't you? Not as much as I thought. Well where is it, the money? Is it here? No, not yet, it's in an escrow account. - But how did-- - That's the craziest party, Morry, it was so easy. How did you do it? I just walked across the office. Okay, Erin, you got the keys? Okay, let's go, et's get outta here. Darrel, make sure you throw out the garbage before you lock up, uh? Sure. And he just left the password sitting there? Why not? Who would possibly take it? Well, how long have you known? Since the beginning. You knew all those years about the laundering, about Sam, about everything? Everything. At first I just wanted to see how far I could get. Well, I guess you got pretty far. Well, no kidding. Before I knew it I was inside of the system. And then all I had to do was just change one of the routings and bam - Bam? - Bam. The money was gone, off in the network with the hundreds of millions of other transactions. Except on the first of the month, instead of some criminals in Latin America or Jersey City getting their laundered money, it goes to me. Darrel, give them back the money. It's not too late. Maybe-- - Morry, they'll kill me. Stuart's already dead. Jake, who knows? If Sam's men get half a chance, they'll... Why do think I did it this way? I can't back out. There's nowhere to go. Look, I know Mom dying hit you hard but... Okay, just what do you think you're gonna do with all the money, anyway? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Maybe go to some tropical island. Buy a sailboat. What's the difference? Well for one thing, you get seasick in the bathtub. Look, don't you understand? It's not about the money, Morry. I'll have done it. For once in my life, I'll have done something. Yeah, and your life, it'll be over. You won't do well in jail. You know that, right? These aren't the kind of people who call the police. No, they just track you down and kill you themselves, right? Not if they think I'm already dead. What? Well, to do that, I mean, you need to find-- A body? Shel? Shel, come on. You okay? This isn't you. This isn't you. You, you can't seriously think that this is gonna work. It is working. That's what everybody's waiting for, isn't it? For me to turn up dead. Sam will think that Jake did it, and Jake will think that Sam tracked me down. It's, it's perfect. Yeah, perfect. And what about those old men? What if they find out? I know, I know, I'm sick about that, but I... They can't find out. Right? I mean, nobody can. Alright, Morry, swear? Morry? I swear, I swear, okay? Ya putz. And what if they catch on? The coffin is sealed. I'll have four hours alone with the body. They'll never know. And if something goes wrong? It won't. In the morning, I'll collect the two million. Then at night I'll take care of the body. I'll make it look like Sam caught up with me. One blast to the face will destroy any dental records. Then I'll simply disappear. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here you go. Have a good day. Hold it. What is that? Those lousy janitors. You can't trust any of them. Yeah. Goodbye. Ooh, they'll be a change in the weather And a change in the sea But from now on they'll be a change in me My walk will be different My talk and my name Nothin' about me's gonna be the same Change my way of livin' And if that ain't enough I'm gonna change the way I strut my stuff 'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray There'll be some changes made today There'll be some changes made Hello. Oh, hi, I'm the super. What, what? I didn't mean to startle you. What can I do for you? I heard some strange noises going on in here. Figure maybe somebody was inside messing your place up. You know, it happens sometimes. Nope. Thanks. Everything is fine here as you can see. If you say so. Darrel? Darrel? Harry, what are you doing here? You're him? I'm sorry? You're him? I mean, don't deny it. I, I thought at first it was a mistake. Somebody who looked like you. No, it's not a mistake. Oh, you gonna kill me then? I didn't kill those people. I knew that was impossible. And the money? That was a mistake also. No, I, I took the money. Look, I wish I could explain. No, please, I don't wanna hear. I know too much already. You have your reasons, I'm sure, and you can share them with God. What about the others? Are you going to turn me in? Ah, may God forgive, I know I should but I can't. Besides, Marvin's quite found of you. It's best if he didn't know why you disappeared, and this way he'll be upset, but... That is what you planned, isn't it, to disappear? I'm sorry. Don't be. Just go. What happened? Do you believe in God, Sheldon? I'm beginning to. That's it, over there. I'm not a monster. No, you are not a monster. I honestly didn't mean for you to be hurt. Or anybody. - God brought you here. He gave you a chance to fill a hole. Instead, you tried to run. You cannot escape God. You cannot escape who you are. What is going to happen? You will be judged. You shouldn't fight it. If you fight, you'll see only monsters coming to tear at your flesh. If you let them, you'll see that they are angels coming to carry you away. And traffic on the innercity parkway is just brutal this morning, Jay. Moving on to the national scene, the manhunt for fugitive accountant, Darrel Zimmer, ended yesterday as the criminal's body was found. The latest victim in a series of organized crime related executions, Zimmer was believed to have been implicated in a nation wide laundering operation. In other news, federal investigators have now... We accept you now boarding on Flight 451 to San Cabos. At this time, would all passengers report and be prepared to board. Please have your passport and boarding passes ready for the attendant. Yeah. Hi. Sir. Here's my ticket. Just gotta get my passport. Jesus. Can I help you? Sir, sir? Sheldon? What are you doing here? Where are you going? Shul, come with me. Please, tell me that you took it. Took what? Last night, when you came to see me. You don't make any sense. I don't understand. You've been drinking? Well, no, I'm considering it. You really weren't there? You're so upset. Tell me, what's happening? Is somebody sick? I've just lost everything. If you need some money to borrow, - No, no, that's not it. - please... So what is it? You were there. I saw you. Tell me that you took the money. You think I stole some money? This is why you are here? No, no, no, Marvin, that's-- You think I took something of yours? That's not it. I don't know anything about your money. I heard some strange noises coming from up here. I figured there must be somebody in here messing the place up. Yeah? I'm looking for the super. Yeah, what is it? Sorry, but a psychic I'm not. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, I'm looking for... He was in my room. He said that I wrecked the place. You wrecked the place? No, no, no, I didn't. Black guy, maybe 50. Oh, sounds like the guy in 14. 14? Which way, where is 14? It's upstairs, across from you. But don't bother. He cleared out yesterday. Left all kinds of garbage out. I've been cleaning up his mess all morning. Hello? Hello, Darrel, are you there? Say something. They were just here. Who was just there? What's wrong? They were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. Darrel, look I'm sorry. You have to get out. - What? What do you mean? He was here, Darrel. He cut two of my fingers off. They made me tell them where to find you. I, I, I don't understand. That's impossible. They already have the money. They, they already-- - What are you talking about? What, what are you saying? They got the money, Morry. It's gone. What? These guys didn't have the money. They didn't have anything. What do you think they were looking for? These guys, they hacked off part of my hand to make me talk. Darrel? Say, say something. Say fucking something. Darrel? Darrel, they know where you are. You have to get out. You have to get out. Forget the money, forget the money. Just forget the money. He left all kinds of garbage. I've been cleaning up all morning. Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey, wait up. How you doing? Give it back. Stand back. Come on, man. You're not gonna shoot me. Let's face it, it's just not you. I wouldn't know what's me and what isn't. Maybe not, but I do. I've been following you for weeks. I know you-- Jesus Christ. Bullets ricochet, you know? I really don't read the literature. Now stand up. Put your hands on, on... On my head? Perfect. Thanks. Where's the money? What money? Why can't anything ever be easy for me? Look, I don't have it. I just got hired to follow you and to get it back. You're lying. Come on. If I was gonna keep it, you think I'd still be here? Photographing husbands screwing their babysitters? This is what I do. Follow people and recover their stuff. Who hired you? Who? Lightman, Jake Lightman. There's no way. That, that can't be. He, he, he doesn't know I'm here. He said he followed your brother here. My brother? Yeah, he said he paid him a little visit to shake him up. No, no, no, that doesn't make... Why would he hire you? Why bother? Why not just come an get me himself? He didn't know if you'd have his money with you. He didn't want you spottin' him, getting all spooked. Oh, my God. They were, they were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. You have to get out. Sheldon? What happened? What is it? Are you alright? None of us are. I'm calling the police. You can't. You don't think so? No, please. They'll kill you. All of you. But what are you talking about? The, the money. It traces back to you. To us? The bank drafts are in Hy's name. That's the name I used. Hy's name? How? There was something about you I liked when you came in for a loan. About 12 years ago. Do you remember? Besides, you're the only Hy I know. The Hebrew Loan bank. I remember. As a Jew, surely you must understand how important this is for the Havurah. After all these years you remembered? I'm sorry. That's why I sent you the money. The gift. That was from you? We thought it was a donation, a gift. It was. Hy, make the call. No, you don't understand, please. The police won't be able to protect you. You'll all be killed. So you tell them. You tell them the truth. The truth is that the money's gone. I don't have it. Except for that. Please, you have to listen. We don't have to listen. The police will listen. The police aren't the ones who are missing the two million dollars. So that's it? We're finished either way. There is a way. Am I right? Yes? I think it's your only chance. He has to disappear. If I'm gone, they'll think that I have it. Now I know what a devil looks like. No horns, no tail. Only greed and fear. You're are telling the truth now because you are scared. That's not true. I could have left without coming back here, but I wanted you to know. I wanted to protect you. I want to believe you. You realize this is all that's left? Marvin, maybe we-- Go ahead. I was once a millionaire. I know how you feel. Now we'll help you. Our way. You're joking? Well, you said you had to get out of the country. But... What did you expect, business class? You are a wanted man. I thought some money. A disguise. What you mean in beard and glasses like in the movies? Get serious. This way, no passport, nothing. You're just another Jew who's final wish is to be buried in his homeland. I don't know if I like the sound of that. Take or leave it. Are these holes big enough? How much air do you need? Give him the pills, please. What pills? Sleeping pills. To relax. So you can sleep. No way. You wanna be awake? He wants to be awake. I'm sorry. I am sorry, too. Oh. Oh, God. There, done. Too bad we had to destroy the newspapers. Otherwise he would have had something to read on the trip. Newspaper. How could they? How did you find me? - It's a small town. - Police have identified the victim... - I know your face. You're sure you don't come before. And missing since late last week. Also missing is his brother Jake Lightman as well as Darrel Zimmer. They, they were just here. Sam's guys. They fucking tortured me. He was here, Darrel. These guys hacked my fingers off. What do you think they were looking for? What, what do you, you have to get out, you have to get out. You're dead if you stay, Darrel. Lousy janitors. You can't trust any of them. This is what I do. I follow people, recover their stuff. You can't trust any of them. Who hired you? Who? Who? Hey? Marvin? - Morry. - Hey, Morry, how ya doin'? How is your hand? My hand? Never felt better. So, you like the new building? Hello? Hello? Marvin? Marvin? Hey? Let me out of here. A tourist. Look at him? I went down in the valley one day I heard an angel singing I heard a voice, I saw no one I heard that angel sing One day, if you're lucky enough, you'll be confronted by the truth. You'll see your life in front of you, and you'll realize just how much you hate it. When that happened to me, I decided to do something about it. I decided to become the person I could be. Of course, once you reach for the brass ring, well, you better hold on because the rest is out of your hands. I went down in the valley one day I heard that angel singing I seen an old devil walking down my way I heard that angel sing In that great and getting up morning I heard the angels singing to me In that great and getting up morning Woo, you know I heard my angels Didn't I hear my angels Hallelujah
