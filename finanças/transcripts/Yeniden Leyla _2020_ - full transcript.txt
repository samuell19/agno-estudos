We naively thought they are just going to cafes to know each other. It's not a big deal, they are young, they can meet up to know each other. You don't hear what I say? It's not only “meeting up”. - But it's more than that. - You don't say! Silly of us to think these teens are decent. I can't believe Zehra did it. - She did! I heard it with my own ears. - God forbid! So what happened? Her big brother learned about the affair and beat the hell out of her. Oh, that's a pity! Last thing I've heard, they locked her in. God knows what happened. But she's going to high school, right? They don't let her anymore. - But I think she's deserved it. - Of course, she has! I told her father Suat how many times that he's gotta take care of her! Okay... Then what? Right. Really? When? What? Are you serious? Oh God! Umut, there's food in the kitchen. Did you have your breakfast? Son, don't fool me, eat your food. You'll go to work, right? You know Ms. Müjde from Kadıköy. Can you come to her place later today? You remember her address, right? She'll give away some of her things. Can you help me to carry them? Okay. Hello? I'm fine, Rüstem, how are you? Okay. How shall we do it? No! There are loads of acquaintances who live nearby, they might see us. There's this place along the road, you know it? Yes! We can meet at that park. Right. That's the place. See you tomorrow then. - Roma got him for 100,000 euros. - 100,000? - Really? -Maybe 500,000 euros. - Very cheap, for sure. Probably my club was deceived by agents. It's always the agents, they are the real trouble. But managing a club is not easy. Imagine there's this skinny lad from Egypt and a real African black guy. - Which one would you sign? - The African. I'd sign him too. That's how we ended up signing Emenike. We expected a goal machine, but we got a washing machine. - Ali Koç will sign a loser again. - No, we'll shine under him! - Fuck off, you match fixers! - What do you mean? - Don't you people fix matches? - Prove it! My phone is ringing, I'll tell you later. Fuck off! At least we don't run away from the field like you. I shouldn't have talked to you about football in the first place. Agent. Black footballer 500,000. Thanks. HOTEL A hotel keeper must always be trustworthy and smiling. Yes? Hey, where are you going? Where are you going? Where do you think you're going? Get the fuck out of here! Are you fucking mental? Throw him out! Fuck off! What keeps you? Walk away! Don't stare at me! If I see you again around here… Fuck off! Who may be calling at that late hour? I forgot to bring the yoghurt. The phone rang during the dinner, I couldn't answer. I didn't have time. We can tell him when you come here. How will we go there? Okay, you've got one for me, but what about Umut? No, that's not possible. How will Umut manage by himself? A hotel keeper must always be trustworthy and smiling. Entering the construction site is dangerous and prohibited. Umut! Umut! I'm calling out to you, why don't you answer? Stand up! Stand the fuck up! What's with that car? How did you manage to do it? What happened to the headlights and the bumper? Umut, why the hell are you like this? You open the shop late, you come to work late, you don't come at all… I don't say a single word. That's how you show your gratitude? Look me in the eye! Fuck off, you shithead! Pack up and just get the fuck out of here! - What's the problem? - We've got a fucking problem! He took the client's car and crashed it! Did you really crash the car? God! Umut? Here you are, son! How are you? Huh? Is everything okay, son? Umut, where are you sleeping, son? Where did you sleep last night? I worry a lot about you, not knowing whether you are hungry or not. Why do you behave like this, son? Huh? Please don't do this anymore, sweetie. You wrote something? Where did you find this? Huh? Where did you find this? I was going to tell you, Umut… I was going to tell it… I was planning to tell it when you grow up. I've waited for you to grow up. I was going to tell it… Son… When I gave birth to you in the village, I was almost a child myself. I had to lie to you and I did. Do you think it's easy to reveal such a thing? Your father's shady business… He told me to keep quiet. He said: “Shut up! Don't say a word!” I don't know how to explain… How can I? Where shall I start? Where shall I start? HOTEL If you go there after midnight... dealers and buyers find each other easily. So we can go there, say hello. Meet them, and try our chance to get some joints. It depends on my folks. If they give me some money, I'm in. We can use my car. We call the girls, and we hit the road. - Look at that, bro. What do you think? - Pretty. I will get her. - You know what, Barış's flat is free. - Who is Barış? My cousin. We went to his place with you. A nice loft in Moda. - When did we go? - You, me and Barış. Don't you remember? You got high and got obsessed with the shop across, shouting its title. Right! The shop was called Hema Home or Homa Home, something like that? - Yep. - So? That flat is unoccupied now? Yes, they won't be home for a while. They went on vacation. I should have asked for the keys, he would definitely give them to me. We could invite the girls. So many pipe dreams! Why didn't I think of this before? "To buy pot." What are these? Hello? Barış, are you downstairs? Can you come here right away? - Is there a problem, honey? - Two jackets and a bag here. Are these yours? - We didn't leave the house like this. - These aren't mine. - Did you give the spare keys to anyone? - Of course I didn't. Somebody smoked cigarettes here. A burglar's broken into the flat. Let's get out and call the police. Out, out! Breaking and entering? What were you thinking? What if he stabbed you, Umut? Oh God! Didn't you feel pity for them? Where is my mind? Let me see. Hold it. Bravo! You beat the hell out of both of them. Don't you feel pity for them? What will we do if they sue us? Huh? Food is really delicious. Enjoy it. I missed Turkish food a lot. What did you put in this one? Nothing special actually. Same old things. Tastes great. They don't use onions or garlic in their food. No way! - Ah! - God! The power is out. - Do we have candles? - Yes, we do. Your mom is your closest one. But, she's also the one you blame the most. You want to pour your heart out, okay? Say your lines strongly. Each line is a punch in the face. Come on give it a try. What do you think I'm at? Aren't I supposed to have any patience to reach the end of, Mother? I know, I know. It seems unimportant to you... what I'm doing, what I want to do. Having a little difference between them! You don't think that... Listen! You think I'm crazy about the warehouse? You think I'm in love with the Continental Shoemakers? Great! Much better. There is one more thing. Don't act "crying". Remember we don't really want to cry in situations like these. Focus on the goal of the scene. What do you want to make your mom do? You just need to focus on this. Keep going. Keep going. God is Almighty. Is this your “surprise”? This place? The street where we shot the film. While we were shooting, you were dealing with other things, huh? I'm a Method actor. While I was studying my character, I explored the neighbourhood. Oh, dear! Take the first right. Turn right. Slowly, bro. Keep going. A bit further. Just pull over on the right, bro. Okay, we can go, bro. - You got it? - Yep. - So fast! - It's our neighbourhood, bro. Don't let them see it. - Ms. Leyla, can you hear me? - Yes. Alright, I'll play the scene now. You'd better watch it before dubbing. Okay. That night, your father came home. I was going to tell him I was pregnant. But he was in a furious state. I could tell something had happened. He said: “That's it.” He said: “They're after me.” We need to dub this part. I'm ready. That night, your father came home. I was going to tell him I was pregnant. But he was in a furious state. - Can we record it in parts? - Sure... Right away! He said: “I have to flee, they are searching for me.” I said: “Where, Rüstem? Where are you going, leaving me alone here?” He said: “There's no other way, I have to flee abroad.” To Germany. Said he will go to Germany... without me. He promised to take us there after a while. Said it's impossible for him to return to Turkey. I said okay. I said: “I'll wait for you, Rüstem.” I had no other option. I waited… One year, two years, three years, four years, five years... Over time, I lost my hope. And I told you that your father is dead. But now your father's case is dismissed. He came back 20 years later. Nothing to cry about this, son. It's such a long scene, the dubbing will ruin it! - Hi there. - Hello, Mr Umut. - How's it going, Hacer? - I'm okay, thanks to God. How are you? I'm fine. After two years, TV star Leyla Sönmez leaving her hit show... Shall we have a toast? Thank you all for coming here. What shall we toast to? Let's toast to the film! Umut... You see, you made me spill my wine! But I believe he already made an album of children's songs. He made an album for children, and made one for himself. - Hey, what's up? - Fine. We were having a chat about… I have no dimples when I smile. Smile a bit… Look, you have dimples. - Do I have them? - Wow! This side of your mouth, you almost have a crater. This side is flatter. It looks hot… Really hot. Right, looks like there's no problem with your eyes. The cause of your discomfort may be many things, probably nothing serious. I'll prescribe you an eye drop. Use it for a week, then let's see if it gets better. Three drops for each eye. Dad? Umut? How are you? Fine. You? I'm fine too. - Who is it? - It's me, Umut. Umut, wait a second, I'm coming. - Hi. - Hi, how are you, Umut? Fine. What happened? The power is out. Come in. I called you, but couldn't reach. I can't find my Zippo lighter. I thought I might've dropped it here in the party. I had an errand close by, so I thought I could drop by and ask you. - I didn't see a Zippo lighter. - Really? - But you can have a look around. - Actually that'd be good. Come in. - How's it going with you? - Fine. - Would you like to drink something? - No, thank you. - Why not? Have something to drink. - Okay, just a glass of water please. Alright. It will be difficult to find it in the dark. Hope I can find it, it's got sentimental value for me. Found it! - Where was it? - It's fallen at the back of the table. Glad you found it. I've been searching for it all day. - Want a cigarette? - Thank you. - Ah, the power's back on. - Yes, finally! Isn't this the dress that you wore in the film? Yes. Why? On the last day of shooting, I came home with this dress on me. When I saw it today in my wardrobe, I just felt like putting on. - So you miss it. - I'm unable to say farewell. Push it really hard... Good! Behind you! Approaching! Resist it! Push it really hard. Push! Alright. Very good. Ceiling is getting lower. Look up! Yes. It's squeezing you. Collapsing. You're getting trapped. Push it! Behind you. It's behind you and pushing you down. Resist it. Use all your power. Don't let it win. It's pressing hard on you. Resist it! Yes. Good. Give your max. Ceiling's coming onto you again. You're almost getting smashed between the walls. Resist it! Be tough! All of them are pressuring you. Push! Push! Push! - Here you are, Feyzo. - Here I am. Hello. Hi. Wait… Here it is. Alright bro, you can go. Thank you. See you. Hello. Hello, Umut. How are you, dad? - I'm fine. Thank you. How about you? - I'm fine too. - I just wanted to drop by. - Right. Good for you. Can I have a glass of water? Water? Sure. Let me bring it. I can get it myself. I have to go to the toilet too. I know the house anyway. Of course, come in. Leyla... Leyla... Go to bed. Let me take you to bed. LEYLA ONCE AGAIN
