ONE OF THE UGLIER THINGS WAS ORDERED BY A BATTALION COMMANDER AFTER A FIREFIGHT WITH THE VIETCONG TROOPS NEAR THIS VILLAGE, A VILLAGE THIS LIEUTENANT COLONEL FOUND GUILTY OF AIDING THE V.C. WITHOUT A SHRED OF GODDAMN PROOF. (Jimmy Joe) HELO COMIN' IN AT 6 O'CLOCK. (Ray) KEEP YOUR DAMN EYES FORWARD. (Jimmy Joe) WHAT THE FUCK THEY GOT IN THERE? BUNCH OF DEAD FUCKING' GOOKS.

I CAME TO VIETNAM FOR REDEMPTION. BUT I'M NOT WORTHY OF IT. HEY, RAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE. RAY! COME ON. (Jimmy Joe) HOLY SHIT, WHOEVER THOUGHT WE'D BE COMING BACK HERE TO GO FISHING? THIS BEACH IS HALLOWED GROUND, FREDDY, HALLOWED GROUND. HALLOWED GROUND. FREDDY, DID YOU HEAR? (Tex) OUR ASSES WERE IN A SLING HERE, BOY. THIS IS IT. (Jimmy Joe) IT'S BEEN A LONG MOTHERFUCKIN' TIME. WHOO! YEAH, BABY. AT LAST, I CAN GODDAMN BREATHE, SHIT. WHAT A HORROR SHOW. MOVE, MOVE! GET YOUR ASS GOIN'! [explosions] [yelling] [screams] I'M HIT! I'M HIT! [machine gun fire] I GOT YOU, BUDDY. HANG ON. IT'S ALL RIGHT! HANG ON, BUDDY! I DON'T WANT TO DIE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE! WHAT DO I FUCKIN' DO, DOC? [screaming] KEEP HIM STILL. IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. HANG ON. [helicopter blades whirring] TELL ME ABOUT THE DIARY, CAPTAIN. BOXED IT UP IN MY WAR GEAR. WHOSE WAS IT? AN N.V.A. CAPTAIN, A POLITICAL OFFICER IN CHARGE OF MORALE, BUT THIS IS FILLED WITH POETRY, NOT PROPAGANDA. SOME TO HIS WIFE, SOME TO HIS TROOPS. OH, BEAUTIFUL. LOOK AT THOSE FISH PONDS. THOSE FISH PONDS ARE CRATERS FROM 500-POUND BOMBS DROPPED FROM B-52s. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS? GOD. THE B-52 WAS THE MOST FEARED WEAPON. THE N.V.A. NEVER SAW OR HEARD THEM UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. [mimicking bird whistle] ARC LIGHT MISSIONS, WE CALLED THEM. BOMBS WERE SO HUGE, SO TIGHTLY CLUSTERED, THEY'D CREATE AN ELECTRICAL STORM. TURNED DAY INTO NIGHT AND NIGHT INTO DAY. THE CONCUSSION CRUSHED ORGANS, STOPPED HEARTS, LEFT NO OXYGEN IN THE AIR TO BREATHE-- NONE. THEY SMOTHERED. WHEN I FOUND OUT HIS WIFE WAS STILL ALIVE, I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT GIVE HER SOME COMFORT TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS IN HER HUSBAND'S THOUGHTS, EVEN THOUGH, ACCORDING TO THIS, THEY'D BEEN SEPARATED FOR FIVE YEARS. MAYBE IT'LL GIVE ME PEACE TOO. [crying] [speaking Vietnamese] SHE THANKS YOU FOR THIS GREAT GIFT, CAPTAIN. SHE HAD ALWAYS HOPED THAT HER HUSBAND KEPT HER MEMORY CLOSE TO HIS HEART. NOW SHE KNOWS SHE WAS NOT FORGOTTEN. THIS SEEMS SO IRONIC TO HER. HIS LAST LETTER SPOKE OF HOW HE WAS WOUNDED AND HAD TO SPEND FIVE WEEKS IN AN UNDERGROUND HOSPITAL TO RECOVER. ABOVE THE GROUND, IT WAS TOO HEAVILY PATROLLED BY AMERICAN SOLDIERS. SHE SAYS HE LONGED TO SEE THE SUN AGAIN. AND NOW WE TELL HER HE DIED IN A FLASH OF LIGHT. SHE SAYS HIS NEXT LIFE WILL BE VERY FINE INDEED. SHE SEES THAT YOU DOUBT THIS, BUT THEY ARE BUDDHISTS. THAT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVE. THAT'S HOW THEY PREVAILED. THEY COULD ENDURE ANYTHING. IF THE AMERICANS BLEW UP A BRIDGE, THEY TORE DOWN THEIR HOMES AND USED THE TIMBER TO REBUILD THAT BRIDGE. NO SACRIFICE WAS TOO GREAT, NOT EVEN HERS. [Eric speaking Vietnamese] I TOLD HER HOW I WAS STRUCK BY THE BEAUTY OF HER HUSBAND'S POETRY. HE INSPIRED HIS MEN TO FIGHT FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY, LOVE OF FAMILY, ALWAYS FOR LOVE. WHEREAS FOR US, HATE, HATE FOR THE ENEMY WAS WHAT MADE US FIGHT. IT STARTED IN BOOT CAMP. D.I.s TAUGHT US TO HATE JODY. JODY WAS ANY GUY WHO DIDN'T ENLIST, SOME PUSSY WHO STAYED HOME AND STOLE THE GIRLS OF THE REAL MEN, THE MARINES. ONCE WE GOT TO 'NAM, JODY BECAME CHARLIE. HATE CARRIED RIGHT ON OVER TO THE NEW ENEMY: HER. THE GOOK. [speaking Vietnamese] SHE SAYS SHE GREW OLD WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND. THEY HAD NO CHILDREN. NOW SHE'S TOO OLD TO REMARRY. BESIDES, WHO COULD LOVE A FACE AS SCARRED AS HERS? [Eric speaking Vietnamese] IT'S OUR WHITE PHOSPHORUS. JESUS. [speaking Vietnamese] COME ON, SHE SAYS. SHE HAS SOMETHING TO SHOW US. [speaking Vietnamese] I HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE YOU, BUT I WILL SING YOU A SONG TO BLESS YOU AND YOUR SWEETHEART. [laughs] TO A SOLDIER WHO'S LOST HIS WAY. [woman singing in Vietnamese] WELL, THIS IS IT, CAPTAIN, YOUR VILLAGE. NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THAT DAY, HAS IT? CAPTAIN, JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, SINCE TOMORROW'S HUE CITY. AT THE COURT-MARTIAL, ERIC'S TESTIMONY WAS THAT YOUR MENTAL STATE AT THE VILLAGE WAS SOMETHING LESS THAN STABLE. ANY COMMENT? IN HIS STATEMENT, ERIC MADE REFERENCES TO WHAT HAPPENED AT HUE AS SOMEHOW BREAKING THE BONDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MEN. CAN YOU FILL IN THE BLANKS SO THAT I'M PREPPED FOR HUE CITY? CAPTAIN, IT'S MY JOB TO ASK QUESTIONS, MY DUTY. I'M SORRY. I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. [helicopter blades whirring] [explosions and gunfire] YEAH. DUTY'S THE NAME OF THE GAME. (Jimmy Joe) HOW COME YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO BACK THERE TO HUE? SHIT, I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT. (Red) HUE CITY. FUCK ME, MAN. I'VE BEEN LIVING IN HELL EVER SINCE. HEY, FREDDY, FREDDY. SIT DOWN, MAN. TURN THAT OFF. COME ON, MAN, SIT DOWN. JOIN US FOR A BEER. SIT DOWN. DRINK BEER. KATHLEEN'S GONE. TOMORROW'S A BIG DAY. YOU OKAY? I'M OKAY. GOOD NIGHT. (Kathleen) GOOD NIGHT. (Ramsey) GOOD NIGHT. THANKS. ALONE AT LAST. MAN OF GOD. WHAT A FRAUD. I MEAN, WHO AM I TO PREACH TO ANYBODY ABOUT ANYTHING? I KILLED, I MAIMED GOD KNOWS HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE. I WISH TO HELL I'D NEVER SEEN THIS GODDAMN FUCKING COUNTRY. (Jimmy Joe) AMEN, TEX. FUCKIN' AMEN. FUCK IT. (Red) WHAT? GO AHEAD. FREDDY, YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? YOU GUYS ARE HEROES, MAN.

I MEAN, BESIDES HIS 30 YEARS SELF-EDUCATION IN PARIS, LONDON, MOSCOW, CANTON, SIAM, AND, HEY, HARLEM. WHAT'D HE DO, PLAY WITH THE GLOBETROTTERS? (Eric) HUE WAS THE CITY WHERE EAST MET WEST.

LIKE CHRISTMAS, FOURTH OF JULY, AND NEW YEAR'S THIS WHOLE COUNTRY JUST WENT INTO PARTY MODE, AND EVERYONE HERE JUST WENT APE-SHIT. [all cheering] RUSSIA WAS LEANING HEAVILY ON THE NORTH FOR A NEGOTIATED END TO THE WAR. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS IN PRE-NEGOTIATION PEACE TALKS WITH US. THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL. THE NORTH HAD TO DO SOMETHING. HENCE RESOLUTION 13, THE GENERAL OFFENSIVE: ATTACK EVERY MAJOR CITY AND EVERY POLITICAL CENTER AT ONCE, SCORE A DECISIVE, NATIONWIDE MILITARY VICTORY. HUE WAS THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN OF THAT TET OFFENSIVE. LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT FOR A--SHIT. (Kathleen) SHUT IT OFF, FRED.
