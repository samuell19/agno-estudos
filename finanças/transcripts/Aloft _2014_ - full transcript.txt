Not so fast, Mommy. Ivan, come on. There's a car coming. Hi. Do you own this van? #Yes. Mark Hanniway sent me. - He said you could give us a ride. - Mark said that? - Yeah, to the meeting point at mile 92. - All right. It's okay, it's okay. It's just me. Here we are. Look for a white Hino with Wisconsin plates and a plow hookup. - He's a buddy of mine. - Okay. #Sorry, sorry, I can't take you back myself. That's fine. Thanks for the ride. - No charge. - Gully, we're here. Come on, wake up. You okay, buddy? Mom, can I go fly Inti? #Just wait, okay? First, I got to figure out what all this is. Let's go, Ivan. Gully, Gully, look. Look over there. That's Architect Newman. What's he giving them? #Turns. It's just luck of the draw. Thank you. - Thank you. - It's your turn, honey. - Put your hand out. - Can I have two? One for me and one for my brother? #And where's your brother? Your brother doesn't need it, honey. Only you get one. First pebble up is the white one. Don't forget, now. Thank you. Thank you so much. You can unwrap your pebbles now. Mommy, we got green. It's no biggie. #Here. We've got the white one. - What's your name? - Timothy. #Can I go in with him? Only the one who needs healing. #The structure's too fragile. I'll be in there with him, though. #We'll be buddies, right, Timothy? Come on, now. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Mommy! - Gully, Gully, wait here. - Will you watch my son? - What are you doing? - It's my boy's falcon. - You can't go in there. - Gully, don't move. Stay there. - It's forbidden! - Hey! - Don't go in there! It's my boy's falcon. I can get him out. #I'll get him to fly out the way he came in. He's flying to the light. Don't be scared. Look. We're done here. Mommy? Where's Inti? - Are you hurt? - No. No? What happened in there? #Hey, lady! Lady! Are there no more healings, then? #What, do you have to leave now? Longley, Kjellberg, Lyrenmann and Walker. You can't leave us stranded here. Come on. #I'm sorry, ma'am, but I was told you and your kids, fine, but the hawk, no way. The man couldn't have been any clearer. Well, the man could have the guts to say it to my face. I could, but I don't care to. You don't care to empathize? Everyone's gone. What am I supposed to do? They're little kids. #Save the theatrics, lady. You know, you're not the only one who knows what it's like at the end of the tether. We all do, or else we wouldn't be here. My whole life, listening to begging and crying, and not able to do a goddamn thing about it. #So don't expect any coddling. Piece-of-shit bird should've gone down with the structure, all due respect. Just let the boy walk home with it. At least that option's open to him. Jeff, come on, let's move, it's getting dark. Sorry, lady. The hawk or your kids. Who would bring that bird here? #How about you shut your mouth. Fine! I'll walk. I don't care. I'm not leaving Inti. Ivan... We can't. We'll freeze, baby. Why did you have to make me come with? It's all Gully's fault. It's no one's fault, honey. #Look. Inti's a big boy, right? #Let him fly, he'll follow us home. Do as I say. Now. Good-bye. No! #What is the matter with you? - Are you insane? - What in the world? #Are you insane? Now we're even. #Ivan? Ivan, come back! Well, I should get there soon. #Luckily I had the GPS. How is it? #Crazy. There's snow everywhere. It's like driving on the clouds. I am glad. You sound well. Please help me find the coordinates for the next act. If not... Her son is my last chance to find her. #I know, I am trying. I wish you had changed your mind... I can't help it. Anyway, everything's fine. Don't worry, I feel good. I know, baby. #Give me that. - Hi. - Yes. Can I help you? #Yeah. I'm Jania Ressemore. I'm a journalist with La Nationale TV. #And I spoke with Ivan Ephron. We scheduled an interview for today. #I don't know anything about anything. Shit! #I'm sorry. Yes, I forgot. Hang on. Baby, what the... Stay over there, okay? Thank you. That's fine. Ivan's out back in the red cabin. - Thank you. - Sorry. #So, I'm going? - Just, yeah, just around the corner. - Okay. - If you don't mind. - Thank you. Thanks. Baby, what's this? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. #Hey, it's okay. It's just me. I'm sorry. #Who the fuck are you? I'm Jania Ressemore. We... #We spoke over the phone a few weeks back. We scheduled an interview for today, and... A documentary on hybrid falcons. How did you get in here? #It's your wife. She told me to come back here. I can come back tomorrow, if that's better for you. #No, I just forgot. It's fine. Okay. So, you've got the market on hybrids cornered. People say your birds are the most beautiful out there. They are. Are you completely self-taught? No, I learned from my grandfather. I understand Nana Kunning is your mother. #Do you two maintain a relationship? You don't share a last name, that's why I ask. It's just a question. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. I made a fresh pot. Excuse me. - Baby, what was that? - I don't want to talk her. - Well, what do you want me to say? - I don't know. - I don't care what you say. - That's very horrible. I do not want to talk to her. I'm sorry. So, I guess we're all done? Yeah, I think so. I'm sorry about that. I'll walk you out. Baby. Can you take him? #Come here, buddy. Come here, buddy. Hello. Hello. Good boy. Good boy. So, are you gonna tell me what happened? What? What? #What? She left that for you. - What? - That. What? Why did you take this? Well, you would have said exactly the same thing if I hadn't. You absolutely refuse to mind your own business. Yeah, I'm such a nosy, nosy woman. It's cold. You should put it in the microwave. Can you take him? I've had him all day. #What have we got here? Well... Alice. Alice. Alice. - It doesn't close. - Yeah, it does. #You have to hold it. Just put your finger there. It's an old computer. I can't believe... There's nobody on earth who doesn't know how to use a computer. I swear to God. #Thank you, honey. Thank you. Don't go playing gentleman on me now. Come on. I've seen her. I've followed her work for a long time. #She's amazing. That's her. That's Nana Kunning. It hurts, right? I know. I know. #I know. Hans! Hans! #Hans! I need help. Nana? Nana? #There's someone here to see you. Hey, Nana? You're only here three hours a day. Try not to have any visitors, okay? How did you get here? #I walked. How'd you find me? You're looking for me, right? #I hope you remember me. Yeah, you're the Architect. And you're Alana Ephron. #They said I'd find you here. I'm Nana. No one calls me Alana. The boy, Timothy, you remember? He's better. The swelling in his eye went down. #Half his vision is back. Pretty unexpected. Is this about my son's falcon? Your son's bird didn't deserve to die, and I'm sorry. Congratulations. On the boy, I mean. Congratulate yourself. #Myself? Why's that? It was you who touched the boy's eyes, not me. #And I had to tell you so. Okay. I got to go back to work inside. I appreciate your concern over my son. I'm glad about the boy. Really. I am. If he's really cured, I mean. Listen, I'll be in town a few more days if you have any questions. I'm staying with the boy's family near the church. Have a nice day. Can you do this one? #Do it as fast as you can. Let's see. Okay, that's very good. #Jump. All right. So, now I want you to walk like a duck. Can you walk like a duck? Like this? Without falling over? Yeah. #Wow. Very good, Gully. You seem to be in pretty good shape. Well, for now, we're fine. The growth seems to have just stabilized. It hasn't... It's only a minor variation. I feel that he's different. That... Like he's regressed. #How do you mean? He wets himself. #He can't control it. And it doesn't embarrass him, either. He doesn't even bother to tell me. Is that related to the tumor? Possibly. If he doesn't notice it, try not to make a big deal of it. Have you heard back? Nana, as I told you before, it's a very high-risk operation for what little can possibly be achieved. I'm afraid there just haven't been any surgeons who are willing to take that chance. I'm sorry. I know you've been through this once before. There must have been advances since then. Please? Okay, look, I will make some more calls. - Please. - Okay. All right? - Okay. - All right. Hey. #What do you say we go do something? How about we go get cider donuts? Don't you think you've punished me enough? You know life's gonna throw you heavier punches, right? It's fine. #You want to just keep trying to dodge them? I can't stop that, but I'm gonna tell you something. #You listening to me? You will never learn how to hit back. I need you boys to wait here for a minute. - Okay? - Mommy, I want to go with you. Mom, I hate staying in the car. I'm sick of it. Ivan, stay in the car. Ivan, you can't leave your brother. Okay, fine. I would've let you know we were coming, but I didn't plan this. It's the playoffs. #Go and watch, if you're interested. Okay. Gully, why don't you go with your brother? My little boy's getting worse. I'm sorry. That's what the doctors say, but none of them will operate on him. I wouldn't be here if I weren't out of options. No one would. You think I don't know that? For what it's worth, I don't ask for money. #Well, you're staying in their house. Never refuse an invitation. Maybe you get off on other people's weaknesses. If your agenda is to insult me, at least send the boys out, and we can thrash this out in the bedroom. Just a joke. #Fuck. This is absurd. #It is. Maybe it all is, but especially this. Just look at you. Here you are, at your wit's end, still putting up with a man that you think is a fraud. Searching me out. Of course it's absurd. But I think you're beginning to see what I already know. We can't avoid pain. But resisting it, that's what causes all the problems. Here's to that. #Right now, everything is incomprehensible to me. My little boy hasn't even lived yet. What was he born for? To die? Can you help me or not? Everyone's eager to receive, Alana. Giving's different. #It's the harder road. It's the one for you. You haven't answered my question. Timothy? No, it's room 12. It's the... #One second. It's the toilet and the sink, okay? Yeah, I need it done. Thanks. #How can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Jania Ressemore. I think she's staying at this hotel. - Do you have a room number? - No. You know what, forget it. Forget it. #39? OK. No, no, this is awesome! Why did she change her mind? Thank you. No, no, I can leave. #I'm done here. I don't know. #Just confirm, as soon as possible. 66 degrees, 33, 39. Love, bye. What is that? It was shot in secret by some of her followers. Thank you for stating the obvious. Most of them were taken in '97, '98, when you were about 18. Consider it a gift. #I don't usually share my documentary footage with anyone. And now someone has hooked you up for the coordinates for the next act. I want to go with you. I don't need you anymore. No offense. Excuse me. - Hi. - Can I get you a coffee? Yeah, coffee, please. #Okay, listen. You came to me because you think that I know something about her. What do you say? It's above the Arctic Circle. Hundreds of miles, some of it over frozen ocean. You don't want to bother, trust me. #That's fine. That's totally fine. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye, bye-bye. What? I'll be back. #I'll call. I'll call you. And Mommy, okay? #I love you. - Bye. - Bye. - See you. - See you. Your passports? #There's only one gate, so... And boarding's at 6:30. - You'll have a bit of a wait. - Okay. And arrival in Nunavut is at approximately 12:30. Here we go. I would like to use the time before takeoff to do the interview, if that's okay. Yeah, you can record my voice, but just not me. But we had an agreement. #Yeah, I agreed. I agreed to answer your questions. Okay, I'll tell you a story. Do you know I had a little brother? We were kids, and... He wanted a glass of water. And he couldn't reach the glass. So he asked me to get the glass. I was watching... I was watching some crap on TV, and I didn't want to help him. And he went and he... He got the glass, and he fell, and he cut his face, and he cut his hands, and... He hit his head. So they take him to the hospital, and they do all these tests, and they find out that he's sick. #The kid is sick. And... I just felt relief. I just felt relief that it wasn't my fault for not having helped him. And I felt relief that it wasn't me that was sick. And all I know is that my little brother was sick, and she couldn't heal him. So what about you, Ressemore? #You got any kids? You got a husband? No. #You got any special people? Gully! #Gully, this way! What are you doing? Gully, the team is going that way. You need to stay with the team. I'm going to count to three. #If not, it's five on the bench, young man. One! #Two! Hey. #What's the problem? Excuse me, I'm talking to you. He's swimming. What difference does it make if he swims there, he swims over there? Just let him swim, please. #Ms. Ephron, the point of this class - is team swim. - Okay, fine. #He's swimming. He's doing the best he can. All right, feel free to sign your son up for guppy classes, then. Gully, out of the pool. Come on. Ivan, you, too. #Mom, no! Let's go. Now. Hurry up, Ivan. Let's get out of here. It's no fair. I don't want to go because of Gully. Come here. You guys love each other, right? That's the most important thing. I would've done anything to have a brother or sister. #You know that? So you have to be there for each other. Always. Okay? Okay. #Now say you love each other. Go on. I love you lots, big brother. Lots. You shouldn't have taken him out of that class. He needs looking after. #I took care of it, Ike. He's in another class. #Yeah. But his feelings, Alana. - He never comes first. - Yeah. #Well... He doesn't need to. Do him good to learn that. Ivan's strong. He can handle it. You think you know everything. He's just a boy. So? What? So what? So, were you able to get in touch with that doctor? You know, that's... #That's Clara's cousin. Yeah. So, you know, it's obvious he's not gonna want to help you. Why? Why is it obvious? Is it honestly that surprising? Yeah. Yeah, it is. #He's a little boy, Hans. Just try putting yourself in her shoes for a minute. #I'd fucking love to. 'Cause my biggest problem would be that my husband screws around, not that my son is dying. #Come on, get a grip. I know this is tough on you, but you don't have to take it out on me. Do you know what? I'm not her problem. #You're her fucking problem, not me. Sure as hell not Gully. Come on, Nana. #You need to start looking at things a little bit differently here, just for your son's sake. Differently? #Yeah. How? #For Gully's sake. Try accepting it. Come on. Calm down. - Let's talk about this later. - I said I'm done. - Excuse me. - You want to finish dressing - before you go out there? - Excuse me. - People are gonna find out. - Everyone fucking knows, asshole. Excuse me. I don't mean to be a bother. #You should leave me alone. I'm just asking a minute of your time. I wanted to apologize for what I did to your boy's bird. Okay. Why? Why? #I shouldn't be here, I know. I got no other choice. We're not from around here. Look, I lost my job. I left everything to follow the Architect. If there was more time, you know, we'd wait for his next act, but we're out of it. He's willing to try it just for Lincey, but... But what? Let him try. The boy's eye. He told us it was you made it happen. You might not want to help me exactly, and I respect that, but I couldn't not try. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a dirty, old, pathetic drunk. You shouldn't follow him anywhere. Look, I don't understand. Why'd you go in the first place if you don't believe? Good luck with your little boy. I hope you find the help you need. Why'd you tell that man I could help him? #Consider it an opportunity for revenge. I don't want revenge. Then tell him you won't do it. #That's not the point. So, why not help him, then? #Fuck you! Fuck you! If it's because it frightens you to think it might be useless, that frightens him, too. No... What am I supposed to do? The same thing you do with your little boy. Hey. Hey, buddy! Can you open this? Come on. Sorry, sir, there has been a truck... No, if there was another way, I wouldn't be escorting vehicles over 100 miles of frozen lake. Sir, I don't have two days, I have to go through today. Well, unless you're planning on walking clear across the lake, you're gonna have to just go home like everybody else. Ivan? Ivan? #The ice is gonna break. What? #I'm telling you, the ice is gonna break. I can fucking hear it. I can see the crack. #It's not going to break! Don't come near me. #Ivan, you have to trust me now, okay? No, stay there. #Please, please stop! Ivan, it's not going to break. #Don't come near me, please! Look at my face. #Look at me, look at me. Just look at me. Okay? Sorry. #It's fine. We're almost there. Pretty small town. I can probably find you a rental in the morning. You know what, why don't you guys stay at my place tonight? We'll get you some food, warm you up, and get you on the road in the morning. - Sound good? - Thank you. - It's great. - Thanks. Sorry I haven't called before now. Reception's being a little shitty. Miss you guys. Adi?s, amigos. If you want to make a phone call, too, you can go right ahead. #No, thank you. - The cell towers are spotty out there. - Yeah. - Okay. - So, what happened? So, he gets stuck out on the ice road. Almost dies. Walks for miles, hours. Finally, he gets to the town, and a family takes him in. Can you believe that? Dying stranger. Anyway... He's coming. He's coming. Get that little guy... Oh, no! #And that is the extent of my French. Cheers. He's awake! Oh, no! He's after me! He's after me! He's after me. He's after me. #Oh, no. - Quick, hide! - He's cute. #Thank you. He's not always cute. #But tonight he's cute. He's coming to get me. #Listen, I'm using my work truck all week, and we have a Jeep that you guys are free to use. - Thank you. - Yeah? - I don't know how to say thanks. - No. - Don't worry about it. - Thank you. - Bye. - What about me? Towels on the bed. Clean sheets. I'm not asking any questions. #I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Thank you. Sweet kid. I've never seen such beautiful destruction. You told the woman back at the house where I could find you. She sent that for you. But you haven't come here just to feed me, have you? We need some more of these, just like that. But she's gone and married a lighterman So it's time for me to go But I would have loved you so, my dear I would have loved you so Oh, a shake o' the foresheet Pays for all For an alehouse shot And a friend forgot And a sweetheart False or kind And I would Have loved you so My dear You have good hands. I used to sew all the hoods for my husband's falcons. They say you're not a falconer unless you know how to sew, but he used to have me do it for him on the sly. People used to come from all over to buy them. But he never told the truth. No one ever knew it was me that made them. Can't say I blame him. I could get used to having you build for me. On the sly. Would I have to marry you for the privilege? Okay. All right, ease up on the brake. Real easy, now. Real easy. That's good. Doing good. Okay, keep turning the wheel. Little more gas. Ivan. I love you, Ivan. What do you think, huh? What do you think? #Hey. You ready? Hey, you ready? You ready? Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. #Put your hand out like this. Hold it up. Okay. Put this here. #All right, you hold it up. Hold it up. Okay. #He's gonna come right there. Okay? Okay. That's it. That's it. Okay. #Yeah. - Can I touch him? - Yeah. He's not afraid. #That's his happy face. He's happy with you. That's his happy face. This is so beautiful. Move! #I'm gonna be as quick as I can, all right? Hey. #If you need me, just honk. Yay, we can... again Look out. Incoming. Stop it! #I'll tell Mom even more. I better go find her. #We're not allowed to get out. I'm in charge. You're not. ...through her body. Thank you so much. Lean back. Are you ready? Move over. What about Mommy? Where is she? She told me to take you home. She's gonna be a while. You don't know how to drive. #Of course I do. Papa Ike taught me. Put your seat belt on. I can't see anything. There's a button for this. What's happening? Where are we? It's a lake! Get out! Hurry! #Open the door! Just get out! It's stuck! Ivan! Wait! #We're going in! Open the window! Quickly! Go! Hurry! Go! #Ivan! - Ivan! - Hurry! Now! Go! - Ivan, I'm scared! - Now! Go! Gully? #Gully! Gully? Where are you, Gully? #Gully! Gully! Come on, Gully! Hey! Gully! Where are they? Ivan! Ivan! May I offer you some coffee, some tea? - No. - No? We thought you would be coming alone, but we understand in your situation... I'm honestly surprised you made it. #It's... A lot of people got stuck out there. #So... - Everything should be here. - Great. Some are in French. I can translate if you need. It won't be necessary. Single. Diagnosed in 2011. You stopped treatment 5 months ago. No kids. Wait, what is this? Ivan. Ivan. Ivan, stop. I'm just asking your companion some final questions about her illness. I am sorry. I don't know what to say. I don't know why he reacted like that. I hope... I don't know. I don't know what to say. I don't know why... #I am so sorry. I hope this doesn't change anything. #Please. You want Nana? Don't worry my little girl. Don't worry. Be strong. I have some documents for you. - Sign the papers. - Thank you. Confidentiality agreement. Thank you. Give me the keys. #Give me the keys. I need the keys. - What was that? What was that? - What? She was this close to not giving me the coordinates. She doesn't heal people. You know that, right? No! I don't, and neither do you. #Give me the keys. Jesus Christ, give me the fucking keys. #What's bothering you? What's bothering you, that I'm sick? Or that I think your mother could cure me? No. That you lie. That you lie. That you're a fucking phony, just like her. Are you even a journalist? Fuck. I don't owe you, Ivan. #Ivan, I don't. You don't get to know everything. What are you doing? You are just as delusional as the rest of her fucking groupies. So, go. Go. - Don't say that to me. - Just go. Don't say that to me. You don't say that to me. I left everything behind. Everything. And at least I have the guts to do what I need to do. I'm not like you, hiding in my cage. Fuck you! Why? Why? Look at me! #Look at me. Why? #So what! He was just gonna die anyway! He wasn't. #He wasn't. Why don't you eat something? He hasn't said a word in weeks. I know you never listen much to what I got to say, but... This time, I'm begging you. For Gully. #Don't, Ike. Think it through. What about Ivan? We'll both have to find a way to give meaning to all of it. Well, explain that to him. Just gonna be for a little while. And you'll be staying with your grandpa. You like staying with him. #Don't you? Now he's gonna be mad at me, too. Why is he gonna be mad? My hawk caught it right before I could stop him. Well, he's a hawk. #He's born to hunt. But Papa Ike says... #Doesn't matter what Papa Ike says. What do you say? That's all that matters, okay? Come on. #Let's have a real good-bye. Give your mom a kiss, okay? Ivan, you're a strong boy. You've always fended for yourself. Well... If you don't want to say good-bye, you don't have to say good-bye, but I'm still going. You know this isn't easy for me, either. Mom? You're gonna have to leave that camera equipment with me. We'll be sure to return it when you guys are ready to leave. - She's just working outside right now. - Okay. - I'll let her know you guys are here. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. You okay? You can just leave that there, thank you. Hi. #Hello. Thank you so much. #Such an honor meeting you. So we thought maybe you could sit over here. #Okay. So, first, you were rather strict about your image, going so far as to forbid any public record of your acts. Why the change? Well, that hasn't changed. We don't record the acts, 'cause it would defeat the purpose. But that has nothing to do with my image. If you'd like to know why I've resisted being filmed, I'd say because I'm beside the point, and I have no interest in creating a product. #But, if I'm honest... I had a real issue with my own image. It made me anxious. But now, I'm approaching my own death, so... I need to learn to relinquish control. Newman Loslein, who was your mentor and guide, instilled in you the idea of art and nature as a means of healing. And I'm assuming part of his teachings touch on love. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I'm not interested in elaborating. You're asking me to perform, like, pluck love out of the sky and examine it for you. It's not what I do. If you have a question, I'll try to answer it with you. My apologies. You don't need to apologize. #You're making assumptions. Why the structures? #Why bother traveling to the infinite? For the sake of art? #Can you come here? I need your finger. You know, the problem is the moment I begin to explain an act, I start claiming it with language. We want to take this possessive stance with everything, right? But it only weakens us, whereas our well-being demands an acceptance of uncertainty. - Thank you. - Thanks. I have a question. How could a mother abandon her son for something she can't even explain? Could you turn that off? You want to say something to me? It's a little late for that, don't you think? So you came here for the interview? Yeah. Yeah, I just came here for the interview. We should continue. What's your favorite color? #What... Yeah, what book had the greatest influence on your work? How's life been? #Ivan. Ivan. #Do not say my name. Do not say my name! I came here because I wanted to see what would happen. #Simple as that. Because I knew you wouldn't come to me. And I thought maybe you'd crumble like one of your goddamn sculptures, but you're not that easy to break, are you? You'll just pick up the pieces and start all over again. Isn't that how life works? Is that how life works? No! What am I? #What am I? I'm just the collateral damage for all your life's good work. Me! #Me, right here! I didn't want him to die. I didn't want him to die. I didn't want him to die. Ivan. Ivan, it was too much to bear. It was too much to bear, Ivan. Will you give her this? If you'd like to open them.
