Cause and effect. "In" is the start of things, and "ga" is their end. It takes both to form a story. A female hunter and a white male dog. The meeting of these two forms the beginning of this story. In other words, the "in". That young hunter knew mostly everything about the mountains. The firmness of the earth, when the wind would cease, the paths the beast took. She learned all these from her Grandfather. They say that a hunter and her prey are connected by an invisible string. The moment that string is tightened, a strange bond is born in their hearts, making them long to be connected. Connected. The girl's name was Ooyama Hamaji. She knew everything about these mountains. But the mountains were all she knew. Your favorite today, Grandpa. Dog stew. Happy? I seasoned it to my own taste with not much miso, though, so you might find it little lacking. Time to eat! Hamaji's Grandfather was eaten by a bear this past autumn. I can't eat all this... What's the matter, Hamaji, dear? Temple Master... Ohh, come now, stop crying. A letter arrived from Edo for you. "To Hamaji. I will take care of you, so come to Edo. Finding new happiness for yourself is the best way to lay the old man to rest. Waiting for ya. Your bro, Dousetsu. Postscript. "Temple Master, read a few 2-bu coins for my darling sister... to cover her travel expenses." What's that about? Here. What you do now is between you and your heart. I'll go! I'll go to my bro in Edo! Edo Castle looks as sturdy as an oak... It's practically a mountain... Well, looks like the Tokugawa Era will be safe for now... Umm, excuse me... I've only just come to Edo today, and... Fish!! Anyone for fish?! Halibut, yellowtail, gurnard! All fresh and caught this morning! Umm.. I don't suppose you know an Ooyama Dousetsu, he's my brother and I? Biidoro! I've got Biidoro! Hang them in the Sun, and conjure an instant Rainbow World! Biidoro! How do I get to the place on this lett? Make way!! Make way!! D'ja want some simmered asari? Open up or keep 'em out? That's what'll decide the future of Edo. Princess Fuse is in the Fukagawa Troupe, right?! Did you see him?! My heart was wrenching! What the heck are you doin', girl? Owwww... Whose prey is that?! W-Why is there only a head there?! For show. Pissed yourself in a fight or something? No! I'm a hunter! I'm used to this! But I mean... this one was still a cub! Y'hear that? This bumpkin's got feelings for a damn dog! I do not! Don't laugh at me! I'll give ya the gory detail. These things are half-human, half-dog. Start of this fall, eight of 'em showed up in Edo. They go around killing people night after night. They're evil and morally bankrupt. The rich, the poor, police, and samurai, even kids ain't beyond 'em. They're fast runners and jump so high there's no hope of catching 'em. They're beast in mind and body, so they're called "fuse." Everyone's terrified of 'em. They look just like humans, so even the authorities are having a hell of a hard time. So. Tormented by anxiety, the Shogun, Tokugawa Iesada, issued a fuse hunting decree. It's got a hefty reward attached, too. Even the jobless Samurai polished their rusty swords, and started roaming all over town. And so! One by one the fuse were hunted down, And it was just today that a fuse was found trying to sneak into Yoshowara, and I, Makuwari, claimed its head! Now there's only two left! Come on, take a good look, kid... Look at that head. It's so freshly cut, the warmth is streaming off it... Knew she'd piss herself! I gotta start looking for my bro's house before the sun sets... You look like you're doing pretty well for yourself. Off to play dice with your reward? Who the hell are you?! Hold it right there!! What's he think he's playing at, that hurt! He went that way! Go round, go round! Whoa there! Not very friendly, are ya? Come on, let's play a little longer. You got some nerve, doin' that to my buddy's eye here. Break that mask and the rest of his face as well!! Sorry, buddy... My throat is so damn parched today...! An out-of-season winter cherry. I have no use for it. Wait, you're?! Let's just leave it here, bud. I am not feeling nice today. Damn you...! I found one! Guys, split into two teams, trap him on Ryougoku Bridge! Got it! Your face. I got a nice long look at it. He's here! Get him! Sorry, just gonna borrow this a sec. Outta the way, boy! Boy? Time you stopped running! I wanna see your face too. Persistent man. You know the ladies hate that...?! Hey! Give it back! Hold up! That's mine! End of the road. I'll cut you to ribbons! ...Changed my mind. Fat chance! Give it up already. If you don't, you'll lose your other eye as well. What the hell are you? Why don't we discuss it over some cheap tea?! I did warn you that I'm not feeling nice today... What people like you need... is pitch blackness without even a moon to spend the rest of your lives in... Help me... Just kidding. Geronimo! Here. That for launching fireworks? No. It's a gun. A gun? That weird shape threw me off... Well, whatever. Thanks, boy. No. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. Ah, that's why... that's why your cheeks are red. No! That's frostbite! There! that's them, there! Stay where you are! Turn yourselves in! "That's them?" You and me, I expect! For now, I guess we've just gotta run! Let me go! Damn it! Is the guy in the river still alive?! Yeah, but he's out cold! So you just came to Edo today, in search of your brother. Yep, but I didn't think Edo was so big and busy. Pass it here. No! You'll just mess with it again. Not the gun... The letter, the letter. Huh... it's got his address right here! I can't read... It says it's at the riverside houses by Kozakura Bridge. Good news, Hunter Girl. It's right nearby. Your white hair is all shiny. So now I've found your brother you're sucking up to me? Sets my teeth on edge. No... I just thought... how sleek it is, it's... Don't you feel uncomfortable around me...? It's pretty. You're a strange one, aren't you? Go on... that way. I want... I want those... Oysters... Son of a... Bro? Dousetsu nii-chan!! Nii-chan! Hamaji?! Yep! I came! From the mountains! You did... Hamaji... You came...! Nii-chan! You okay?! ...Cold... One, two... Hamaji, is it really you?! I'm so sorry! Thank you, thank you for coming... Thank you for the letter! I was really happy! Why didn't you send one back, I'd have come to get you! Did you arrive in Edo just today? You must've been a bit lost... I was fine! That guy told me where to go! Huh? Where'd he go? Well, make yourself at home. I-I guess Edo isn't just all big buildings. It's a bit dirty, but the loft up top's yours to use as you want. It's a lot tinier than your mountain lodge, but just put up with it for now. I'll have a big mansion built for ya before too long. Hey, Bro! I like this place! Ah, haha, that's great. Calm down a bit, though. Gun. Check. I also have the bullets, the gunpowder, and the repair tools. Good. Also... Zomi beans, bear gall bladders, your favorite, dried mochi... and a boarskin belly band. Th-Thanks. R-Right, so, I hear that being born a girl hasn't stopped you developing into a fine hunter. Nope. Grandpa praised me for it. Said I have the knack. Why'd you bring that with you. He's been worried about you all this time. Look, we were having a conversation. Just put your hands together for him. Sorry, old man, but I am set on becoming a samurai. I finally found a way to get there. A way? Sure! In fact, the reason I called you to Edo in the first place- What? Dousetsu has a girl over? That ain't good. Funamushi is not pretty when she's mad. Yeah, it was probably a girl. But still only about yay high. Gotta be a kid, right? She was bigger than me. Oy! If you're gonna snoop, put some effort into it and snoop properly! Good day, good day, nice to meet you. My name's Yoshirou. Hope we can get along. I'm Touta! I was just out by the clothespole. He's my son, incidentally. H-Hi. M-My name's Hamaji. Thank you for al? My little sister. Don't look alike, do you Not at all! Cut it out. M-My name's Bansaku. We all live in these beat-up row houses here. The one at the back is where the old boatman Zanzou lives. He should be gettin' back soon. This place is pretty remote, but the main river and Ryougoku Bridge are nearby. Fireworks! Yep, and we have firework shows in the summer! I think you'll find we're a fun little playgroup to live with, too. Playgroup? Grow up, man. Oh, here we go. Ahh, my shoulders. Guys! Grub's up! Geez, couldn't Zanzou row any faster? I'm hungry! Food Food Food Food Her name's Funamushi. By day she goes around selling food from her boat, and she drops by here as a last stop. You must be hungry? I'll have miso dengaku and a sweet omelette. Also, deep fried daikon, really soaked in the sauce. What's this? Nice eye, Touta! That's my new creation, "Fluffy Egg Clam Parcels." I'll have those! I'll bring it over to you, so go wait over there, okay? Okay! The abalone and gently simmered tofu for me. You'll take sake with that, right? The lady knows her food. Dengaku and the deep fried daikon and some sake. Here's a new face. She's my little sister. Hamaji. S-Sister?! You had a little sister? Didn't I say? Where you from? T-The mountains. Mutsu Province. Add in a sweet omelette as well. When d'you get here? I a-arrived this morning. Save this for later! Just throw her something for now. Money? ...Tab? Nope. Then... I'll pay in installments. I left those mountains about five years back, see... Hadn't seen my sister in a long time. Five years back... that's when Ma died and shorty here was born. We've both changed a lot. I think Bro lost a little weight. But I knew it was him right away! More proof that Dousetsu never gets anywhere. Your stupidity doesn't look like it's going anywhere either. What are you planning to do starting tomorrow? You know, work? "Those who don't work, don't eat?" When you live in Edo, everything costs you money. Money, huh... I'm a street vendor, I go around selling stuff like bamboocopters and paper balloons. You wanna work with me, lil' Hamaji? ...tie for workhh... Leave her alone! Starting tomorrow, she's gonna be earning living by hunting in Edo with me. What? ain't up to the job? As if! I have confidence in my hunting! Hunting in Edo? Is he serious? You just watch! I'll bag the biggest game you've ever seen! Funamushi! One more bottle, let's get some fire in us lads! Bro, get under the covers properly! Whaddaya my mom? Did the Temple Master give you anything? Few 2-bu coins or something? Nope. Damn that bald Monk. Hey. What's our prey? What on earth are we going to hunt? Bro? Take care now! Say hi to Funamushi for me! Good luck with work! Thanks! Good morning! Nice weather today, isn't it? Oh! You are up nice and early! Morning! Bro... shouldn't you wake up now? Are you hungover? We're going hunting, aren't we? Hamaji! You got your gun?! Put this on. Wear this. Ahh?oww! From today, this will be our Job. Let's be perfect partners, in perfect harmony. "Om" I... can't read. Oh... ...mm... Fuse... are canine beasts that devour human life-orbs. Life-orbs? The soul, in other words. Actually, yesterday, before I met up with you, I saw the heads of those "fuse" out on display... Then I can jump right to the point. If you get rid of the fuse, you can receive a massive reward from his Lordship, who lives over there. If I get lucky, I might even be made an officer. Hey, Bro? What is an Officer? Well, basically a well-paid Samurai. Today I'll show you around, and you can get some sightseeing in as well. Hm, let's see... go through the Kaminarimon, go around Shinobazu, Browse around Yoshiwara and that's enough for the day, I guess? Y-Yoshiwara? Sure. Women aren't allowed in there. That's why I've got you dressed up like that. Wow, uh... Thanks for all this. Hold thy tongue! For it was but the nature of a brothers love! Bro? Fuse look just like people, right? Sure. How do we tell them apart? First, they have canine fangs. Second, you should able to pick up a beast smell. And lastly, somewhere on their bodies, there's a bruise that looks like a peony. A peony? Yep. A peony flower, with eight segments. S-so, what's their weakness? This. Until you lop their heads off, they'll keep coming at you even if they're crawling. Canine fangs. Beast smell. Peony bruise. Canine fangs. Beast smell. Peony bruise. Canine fangs! Beast smell! Peony bruise! Right, Hamaji, sightseeing is over. Let's head to our real hunting ground. Be careful! It's pretty muddy underfoot! Keep up! We'll lose each other! This gate... its like a huge mouth! Your mouth's open pretty wide as well. Come on. This is Yoshiwara. I can't get over this place! Everywhere's bright and sparkly! Those are the colors of the women of Edo. Don't forget we're here for fuse-hunting. Keep your eyes well peeled. There's about four thousand women living here. If you include the trainee maids and the customers, it can't be less than seven thousand people here a day. Wouldn't be surprising if there's a fuse among'em. Hey, Bro? What do people come here to do, anyway? It's... a place for men to seek the warmth of young women to warm their hearts...? Hmm, I kinda don't think I'm describing it well... But it's basically a paradise for men. Paradise... Its is... kind of a little... scary... What? What? Hey!! Good news, young lad, You're in luck today. Whatta you want, lady? I'm not here for fun today! We've got an amazingly young and curvy one who was only broken in today. Just two silver coins. Young and curvy? Yep, a sparkly new one! Oy, lady! If she looks like some trash the wind swept in, I will not be happy! Trust me! Huh? Bro? Oh no, if I get lost... Young Master, you don't have to be so nervy. Wh-Who are you?! It's okay, it's okay! This is your first time in the pleasure quarter, right? I'll take care of ya. No need to be scared. L-Let go already! Wh-What happened? Wait, a fight? Keep out of it, nosy ass! Welcome. Will you be staying tonight? Or simply here to unwind? That hag! Sword, sword! You forgot this! Th-Thanks. Don't forget you're here to hunt!! Hi there, cute little Master, here to have some fun with me? Not r-really, I... My body feels like it's burning up! Come on, won't you have a feel for me? I'm actually looking for someone... Don't you want a little taste of fantasy? No no no, come with me! Cut it out, girls. Hey, Hunter Girl. I've been looking all over for you. Girl? Why're you dressed like that then?! Making life hard for us. Yep. She's a girl. Too bad for you, Otaki. Sh-She's with you Shino? Pretty much. Wow, what a buzzkill. Shoo, shoo! Come by and drop some cash on us every once in a while! Um, thanks. That's what happens when you dress like that. They belong to my Bro. Thought that was about the size of it. This way! Where are you going?! I won't do anything bad! Come on! You'll be left behind, young master! The things they sell here are what the prostitutes use when not on the job. They're in-your-face publicly, but secretly they have class. Women really do have two sides. I'll buy you something. It's thanks for before. Pick anything you like. I-I can't... just choose...? Just like that? Oh, nice to see you, Shino, my dear. What can I do for you today? Show her a tsumugi kimono or something that suits springtime. Oh my... what a darling girl. Well then, Shino, go loosen the second on the left. You just order your customers around, huh? No, no, the next but one. Stupid. Good, good. I just got a wonderful one in. Good, good and stop. I'll be down with you in just a moment. Sorry... don't want it. Huh? This wouldn't suit me! Maybe someone else... not me. You should save that for after you've tried it on! So true. And if it doesn't suit, you can always change yourself. That was deep. Wasn't it, though? Why do you do this to me? My dear, are you his girlfriend? No, it's not like that. He's not easy to approach and he doesn't minch words, but Shino is a gentleman in every sense. He is a wonderful person who treats everyone equally. It suits you more than well. Your heart will catch up before long. Dear me, is my face that large? One kimono beauty, made to order. Wow...You really were a woman. What's that supposed to mean? Oy, tailor. Add in a matching hairpin and sandals. As you wish, sir. Please show up, Hamaji. I'll take all the blame. You seem to know a lot of people around here. I guess. Is it the girls? Well, a girl, yeah. Actually, I had something I needed to tell her today, but I can't do it. I'm about to turn tail and run. Stinks, doesn't it? This is Ohaguro-dobu, one of Yoshiwara's claims to fame. Ohaguro is that black stuff that married women cover their teeth with. Prostitutes who left the game, babies with no one to take them. They just end up chucked into this ditch. The other face of Yoshiwara. I guess this too is a hidden side of women. Hey, do you have someone special to you? Why do you ask that? I just thought, i wish I had what he does. This is the only gate, so if you wait here, you'll be able to meet up. See ya, Hamaji the Hunter Girl. How do you know my name? I read the letter from your brother, remember? That's not fair! You still haven't told me yours! Will you remember it? It's Shino. Shino. Thank you..., for the kimono. I don't need thanks. i was just paying you back. Right... we're even, then. Even, huh. You're a strange one. Hamaji! I've been looking for you, my cute little partner. Hey... Did you find any fuse? Haha, nope. None to be found. The shops are all shutting. Let's take a look at the night-time cherry blossoms and head home. It's the twilight bell. Now is when Yoshiwara really gets going. When the night stalls begin in earnest. Yoshiwara Saiken! I'll take one! The courtesan parade is starting! I heard it's Itezuru today! Itezuru? She hardly ever shows! Let's go worship! The apex of the pleasure quarter. They say she's so beautiful you forget to breathe. So like... you want to see her? Yeah. Oh, here we go, here we go! The maiden's descended from heaven. Look at that, she's so white it's like she has no blood. I haven't got the breath to sigh. Wow, that just melts your heart. Courtesans really are somethin' else. Hey, Hamaji! Get over here already, this is magnificent! I'm trying! I can't see anything! Here! Grab on! Bro! Sorry... my hand slipped. She's a fuse. Oh, come on. There are eight segments on her calf. Peony. Bruise. Beast. Smell. It can't be... Courtesan Itezuru is a... She's a fuse! Scary as hell. She can suck my life-orb out any day! This ain't a joke! Run, you idiots! Such disrespect! Begone, you plebeians! This is a hunt! Amateurs shouldn't get involved! What a strange guest we have here! She's a fuse!! There's a fuse on the loose!! She takes your breath away? Let's go Hamaji! Great job finding her out, my talented sister! She's swift! Officer and reward money! That's either a dead end or its cuts through! Let's pincer her at the big cherry blossom tree! Got it! Don't panic! You too! Tell me... why? Why don't you come to see me? It's been ten days since the date we arranged. Tell me. Shinbee! Tell the truth, I wanted our meeting to be in bed... Don't hate me for this, Courtesan!! Don't make this drag! Just leave me alone. I'm in enough pain as it is, recently. Ditching your customer, eh? That sucks! Bro!! What, Itezuru? No way, that's gotta be jealous rumours from the prostitutes. Yeah, I mean she made it to the top inside this year. So fast! I hope my Bro didn't get hurt! I-I'm so sorry. No, uh... Thank you very much. Sorry, but I'm in a hurry. Please tell me this pathway widens at the end! Uhh... I can wait for you to finish eating, But could I possibly ask you to pull me out? Calm down. This is no different from when i was in the mountains! Connected! Did I get her?! Maybe I should go to see Shinbee now. No, that'd just cause trouble for him. Why let him be hunted too? I extend you my warmest welcome. You're a fuse, aren't you? You can't run anymore. Run? There was never anywhere for us fuse to run in the first place. So Ohaguro-dobu is where I meet my end. That's so pitiful I'm almost laughing. And this... marks my retirement. I'm not afraid to die. Now, hurry up and do it. Little girl. Oh, you're feminine alright. It's obvious that you're just disguised as a man. You're scared of being a woman, aren't you? Shut up! As a fellow woman, i hope you will listen to my last request. Don't make sudden movements!! Take this to Shinbee on Mount Atago in Shiba. Why do I? I'll give you my head. Won't you do this... to call it even? Did you know? The character for "fuse" is written as "person" next to "dog". I can't read... Hamaji! Out of the way!! Bro! Fare thee well... Word is the seventh fuse has been hunted! Hurry, hurry! Who did it?! Hey Kisuke! go call an officer! We have too report this to the authorities! Bro. We did it, Hamaji. Fire! One, Three, Four! Keep the barrel level with your left hand, and fire from the dead center of your body! Load the next bullet! Readyyy! Sir! Only one left. Glistening when drawn, O great blade of justice, Murasamemaru shield our pure blood from impostors who press us to open our doors. Please lend me the last of your power. And bring justice to those who are evil! The maggots have started on it. Daikaku. Take this with you when you leave. Yes. Commissioner Aboji. Yes, my Lord. How are the preparations for the Carnival? My Lord, i must advise that in your present state of health, holding a Festival at this juncture would be? That is exactly why we must hold it. Everyone is uneasy. Why don't we open up the Castle, and offer grand recreation for them? That sounds perfect. Daikaku! Will you please learn to? The people of the Castle are constantly concerned about their safety. I am sure the citizenry will be overjoyed as his Lordship's consideration. I thought so! I have to see these events through to the end. For riding Yoshiwara of the fuse, you are truly worthy of commendation. Thank you. Thank you. His Lordship is most pleased that matters were settled without undue disturbance. Such being the case, i present you the reward money as promised. For now, the first 100 ryo. It is somewhat cumbersome, therefore the remaining 400 will be delivered tomorrow by envoys. Thank you!! In installments! Installments? D-Do you understand what you're saying?! Sir, could we arrange for this money to be delivered a small amount at a time? Idiots don't go in for that kind of reserved crap! Let's hear your reasoning. I just think becoming an overnight millionaire is kind of unfair to everyone else. Discipline of frugality, is it... very well. I hear that it was a joint effort between you brothers, so you are afforded a say. B-Brothers? I, I really think? Installments!! Add the onion and mitsuba to it as you like, okay? Grandpa told me that hunting was about making connections. We splashed out on this. Go on, eat. At that moment in Yoshiwara I... connected with that fuse. Yet... we still aren't even. Please come again! Hey, Hamaji maybe we should we split up and look for the last one. Yeah, good idea. It might be faster that way. Describe where the house is? Riverside houses by Kozakura Bridge. Right, well done. {\fad(500,500)}Please don't go {\fad(500,500)}Don't leave me behind {\fad(500,500)}It feels like this sorrow could tear my heart apart {\fad(500,500)}The stars in the night sky {\fad(500,500)}The fog in the early morn {\fad(500,500)}I'll give you, I'll give you {\fad(500,500)}I'll give you them all {\fad(500,500)}So please don't leave me behind A Carnival? What's that about? Lord Iesada will be extending us commoners an invitation into the Castle! That Shogun must be feeling a bit forlorn. A chance for everyone to party as a unit, before the Country opens its doors. You help too, Dousetsu! A festival, huh. Pretty extravagant. What happened to you becoming an officer? Don't hold out on us, O learned one! Honestly, I stopped giving a crap around about when I got the cash. Just gonna live and drink for a while. Hey, hold on! Dousetsu! What? We have to talk. Can you make some time tonight? This isn't so you can press me about my tab, right? I'll be here waiting. ...Right. Excuse me... hello? I knew it! You are Ooyama Dousetsu, the man who took care of the fuse, are you not? S-Sure, that's me. I have been entrusted with a message for you, you see... Please take this. What's this? Some kind of ticket for a play? Yes! Is this the Fukagawa Troupe?! That's right! Thank you very much! I came here today to present you with an invitation to our wakashu-kabuki show. Naturally, your gun-wielding little sister, and all of you are also invited! Yeah! No problems in Edo again today. What is that? Is this... me? Kawaraban. Three mon each. You're the one who's been selling these, aren't you?! You're that? I might not be able to read but i sure understand pictures! You've got me as a man here, haven't you?! That's pretty rude, you know! You're... a girl? Yes I am! Do it over! Can't. Already did the woodcut. Woodcut? To be able to make something like this you're really something! Oh, oh no... it's really not that hard. Is that your latest? I'll take one. You there, boy! I'll take one too! Why boy... How much are they? Oh, umm... Three mon each!! Kawaraban! Get your kawaraban! Three mon each! Latest issue on fuse-hunting! Kawaraban! Mount Atago in Shiba? Yeah. Do you know where it is? Is it close? It might be a little far if you walked. If you went by boat down the main river, I think you'd arrive by sunset, though. Thanks. You're amazing, Meido. Only my age and making kawaraban. Getting rid of fuse is way more impressive. But, well, my Grandpa works with novels, so that might have been part of it. I totally get that! I became a Hunter because of Grandpa. Did you like your Grandpa? I'm always at loggerheads with mine. Ever since his eyes went bad, he makes my mother do everything for him. So I'm refusing to talk to him, to get my own back. Sounds hard on everyone. Yeah. I almost hate myself for acting this way. It's Hamaji! Hm? Quick at spotting the women, aren't you, my slick little chappy? Heeeeeey! Hamaji!! We're just going to call old man Zanzou! You wanna come see the kabuki too? Kabuki? The Fukagawa Troupe! Everyone else is there already! It's a small theater act that's been popular recently. They're performing on Mount Atago in Shiba. You wanna come too, Miss? It's called wakashu-kabuki. It's a type of play featuring only men. So even the female roles are played by men? Yep. Oomori Kokubyaku there is a really popular actor. Big names from Saruwaka tried to recruit him, apparently. The line's moving. Kokubyaku, it is almost time. The guests you invited have arrived. Right. Satomi Hakkenden... Wow. So the original work was a sad story about dogs and humans? Precisely. It's a story of bittersweet love. Aw, man... I thought we were gonna be seeing some sword fights. Well, you aren't. A love story, huh? I thought there a lot of women here. Funamushi really should've come. Well, y'know. She said she didn't feel like it, what more can you do? Hey, this kabuki is one of those "counterfeit" works, right? Counterfeit? Yes, seems like it. One of those impostors works where they mess around with books. Gansaku! (Counterfeit) No, no! My name is Bansaku! You seem pretty knowledgeable about all this, little miss. Yes. My Grandpa was the one who wrote Hakkenden. Takizawa Bakin. My Grandpa. The Sengoku period, in Awa Province. This is the story of a one great man, chosen by his family's treasured sword, Murasamemaru. His name, Satomi Yoshizane. Within his castle of Tsurishiro, one night, a jewel of a baby girl was born. She is as beautiful as the full moon that shines this night. I shall conceal you in the Castle, conceal you from the people of the village, and you shall discard the self, and live a life of peace and kindness. And so the girl was named "Fuse," meaning "conceal." Time flows on seventeen years. I see. So this is how they're spinning it. My god, here he comes, Princess Fuse! Look at me, Koku!! As a child, the princess ran across fields and climbed mountains. She never concerned herself with reading, and was almost like a boy. He's the romantic Kokubyaku we were talking about. However, after taking in a dog with fur like white velvet, called "Yatsufusa", or Eight Spots, Princess Fuse started becoming considerably more feminine. As if he were her double, Yatsufusa darted around fields and climbed mountains, while Princess Fuse gazed at him lovingly. Shino! My god, he's beautiful! If he's a man and pretty as that, that puts this ugly lot to shame. Sadly, these happy days were not to last long for Princess Fuse. Anzai Kagetsura from the neighboring province made a sudden invasion! A crisis for Yoshizane. Cornered, he vowed: whosoever brings him the head of the enemy general, shall be rewarded with Princess Fuse's hand in marriage! A shock! The one who brought him Kagetsura's head was Princess Fuse's beloved dog, Yatsufusa! And so, as promised, the dog and the woman became husband and wife. Hamaji. When the play ends, I'll be waiting in the back shrine. But there is more to this story. The story goes that Princess Fuse and Yatsufusa had a child together! I cannot permit this! For my daughter, a daughter of the Satomi family, to bear the child of a hound! Farewell, all those I loved. I shall take Yatsufusa and this child, and live away from the Castle. The woman and the dog vanished into the Forest of Fuse, far from civilization, Bye bye! Come again!! and some say, the life the Princess carried that day, was the beginning of what would, in later era, become knows as the "fuse". But that is a story for another play. Thank you for coming! Thank you for coming! We hope for your continued patronage! We await your next visit! Bro? Hm? What's up? I forgot to buy an actor portrait. You wanted one of those? I'll buy ya one. Don't worry, I have money. Could you... go on ahead? I'm sure I'll catch right up. Hamaji... don't be too long. Okay. I didn't call out to her, but Hamaji turned around anyway. In that moment, we had connected. Shino?! What's it they call this, a duck carrying green onions? Except in this case, its carrying a huge gun. Let go! Who are you people?! Oh, that makes me sad. We know all about you. That you have connections with a fuse. She's a girl?! It's gonna be a fun night tonight! Where is that fuse now? If you don't answer, I'll break your jaw. All the fates were against you guys. My throat was parched again today. I always suspected... you were the last... Shi? You know, I've been wanting to eat your life-orb so damn bad! Now kill me, please... with that gun of yours... kill me!! I just came over to deliver a letter to Shinbee? He's long dead! Shinbee was Itezuru's child. The child of a fuse and a human. I don't know who the father was. A child is a death knell for a courtesan, so normally I was taking care of him. She was only a mother to him once a month. I'd pretend to be a customer. Sneak him in to see her. Hurry the hell back home! Hunter girl! Funamushi! I was waiting till I became an officer, but... Would you... be my wife? I want to work, and I don't want to give in. All this... scares me a lot too! Give me... a little time Hamaji! Any luck? Nothing! Looks like she's got herself lost. Damn it! Hey! Take an umbrella! Excuse me... Hello? Are you alright? Um, is Meido here? Huh? Meido... give me a moment. Hamaji?! What happened to you? So warm... Otai, could you carry her in? Certainly, Madam! I'll go ahead and boil some water. Yes, Madam! Did you write this as well? Don't, don't! It's still written really badly. A new kawaraban? No. A yomihon. A story. But it's no good at all. It's so tricky. Doesn't feel like you have a fever. You were just cold. So you're going to be a learned author of yomihon. Oh, don't! It's just a dream of mine. I'm nothing next to the the fuse-hunting girl. I can't do that anymore. I can't fire another bullet. I was hoping you could read this for me. Love letter? No. Just a letter with no place to go. That will do for tonight. I will drive out all the impostors. Please choose me. Murasamemaru, Murasamemaru, Murasamemaru, Murasamemaru... I understand your desire to humor Lord Iesada. But we warriors serve the long history of Tokugawa behind his Lordship. There is no other option but to have him stay put tomorrow. How is your progress? Around five p.m., the curtain will open on the special stage. And you said he was called... kokubyaku? On my remaining eye, sir, i swear my information is accurate. There's a big lake past where all the stallholders are lined up. That's where we have the overwater stage. Wow, that's nuts! A stage just for us! It is more than we deserve. Thank you very much. The wives of the noblemen will be observing from across Gejou Bridge. Do not point your rear ends toward them. Of course not! My ass will be firmly under control! Ummm, where are the lavatories? Lavatories? Hmm, right. This one here's closet. But don't go beyond that. is this a road? A bridge? You don't know how to read maps? Here's the bridge! Main tower! Stage! Ah, excuse me. Hamari... I can call you that, can't i? Would you care to join us for some breakfast? We have plenty more. Right! Thank you very much! I'm really sorry for worrying you! I'm completely fine now! This is Meido's Grandfather. His name is Bakin. I-It's a pleasure to meet you! I've heard a lot of tales about you from your granddaughter! He's writing a yomihon, you know. I know. It's really popular among the people of Edo, isn't it? I can't read, so i didn't know about it at all! You can't read? Nope! So i'm getting Meido to read it to me! Satoimo Hakkenden! Idiot! Satomi Hakkenden! Ahah...! Uh, I'm sorry, Mister Bakin... No, no. There's no need to apologize. Since my eyesight deteriorated, I too have been relying on Omichi here to write for me. Please don't apologize. I guess we're not so different, if neither of us can read or write! What? Hey! What's so funny?! Someone explain! You two should go together to the Carnival Lord Iesada is holding today. I hear there will be lots of stalls. What do you want to do, Hamaji? The festival at Edo Castle. Festival? Ah, oh yeah, the Fukagawa Troupe we saw yesterday will be there performing as well! So that's why he? The food was delicious, thank you very much! H-Hey, wait a sec! Hamaji, where are you going?! I finally figured out where i have to take this letter! Thank you! huh? I think you got your stubbornness from your Grandpa! Hey!! Hamaji!! Bro? Sorry. I'm... sorry too for worrying you. Hamaji, I'm gonna be a parent. Funamushi is with child. I might not look like much of a parent now, but I think I just have to change myself until I do. It'll happen! I'm sure you'll catch up in no time! I got a lead on the last one. I'm going fuse-hunting! Hey, Hamaji! Don't kill it! Just make things even! I love you, Bro! An overwater stage with the main tower beautifully reflected. Oh, no... I'm getting jittery already! Don't pee yourself! You wait till we're on stage! I'll mess everything up for you! Don't take him seriously. He's just teasing. Look. Up there. Look at that amazing Tower. What a marvel. Let's make this a good one. What is it? Kokubyaku? It was on your back. A cabbage white butterfly! Now that does bode well! Do you have any water? You look unwell. Drank too much last night. You are the members of the Fukagawa Troupe? Ah, yes, sir! We cannot thank you enough for calling on us to perform for you today! The actor calling himself kokubyaku would be that man there, correct? It is I who should thank you! Guards, take him away! That man is the last fuse! I know you remember me. Oh dear, do I have a fan? Kokubyaku, what on earth is going on? Good question! I'm terribly sorry, my familiar friend, but the play hasn't started yet! Wrong. Playtime is already over! Oy, fuse!! I'm not feeling nice today! You took the words right out of my mouth! Don't come any closer! Kokubyaku... you're tellin' me you were a fuse? Why did you stop?! Tell me you're still acting! Play the part through to the end! Then I could have kept believing in you! Sorry. The act is already over. After him, after him! Do not let him into building! Shinbee. Each time you ask when you can see me again, torrential rain pours down inside my heart. That rain water builds, and builds, and when it has filled me to the point of overflowing, I will be able to see you again. That is my belief. I'm sure that at that time, the rain will become a river of joyous tears. Shinbee, do you remember the wet plate photograph we took in Yokohama? I am always gazing at that photograph, and recalling your round forehead, your cheeks as soft as mochi, and your delicate little hands. Whenever I make to let go of your hand, you always know it is time, and ask me, "Hey, when can I see you again?" Hamaji? You're in a hurry, aren't you? I'll take you. You've got a whole hour before the play starts. Don't worry. You'll make it. Thanks. Umm, I hope you'll let me hold the baby too! Face forward. You know, I just stopped caring about what it means to be womanly or manly. Dousetsu got mad at me. Told me to be honest to my feelings. And then I won't be scared anymore. Well, yes... take away the honesty from my bro, and there's really nothing left! I'm going to try my hand at being a mother. All done! Kapow, you're a girl! Right! Funamushi! I'm going ahead! Go for it! We'll be waiting back home! Thanks! Aahh, I just had that looking nice. If you want your life-orbs eaten, make sure you form a nice neat line! He's going inside the keep! Damn it, if only he didn't have that hostage. Send the firearms unit to cut him off. But, Commissioner Aboji? I don't care! There's no national shortage of third-rate Samurai! Form a line!! Ready ammunition!! Wow, you've been betrayed by your masters along with me. Too bad for you. A dog might whine about it, but sorry to disappoint, I'm a human. I'm used to being betrayed. The stairs at the back of the Inui Turret. Iesada is on the top floor. Now go. There! There! There!! Fire!! Anyone seen my katana?! The fire basket! Someone call for help! I'll be waiting for ya in the next world with a hot cup of cheap tea! I'm here to hunt the fuse!! Hey, hold it! Damn that fuse... He plans to go right inside! Hurry up and shoot him dead! Commissioner Aboji! It's dangerous to shoot around here! We have to evacuate the people who came for the festival before? Silence! I'll authorize it! The fuse is Hamaji's prey, right? Yep. Let's use the human bamboocopter. Up for it, eh? You're the son of a street vendor all right. Readyyy!! Commissioner, let's have some fun!! Commissioner Aboji... Hey, you!! Trade it in for a bow, ya novice! Wh-What the hell is she doing?! Keep your hands off that fuse! He's my prey! Girl or not, show no mercy! Fire! Fire!! Owww... Hold it, hold it! It's Yatsufusa! You're Kokubyaku's girlfriend, right? I'm just headed to the lavatories inside the Castle, would you please come with me? ...Oh! I've been waiting for you! Someone bring the water from the rain water tanks! Fire brigade! Someone call the fire brigade! First priority is the tower! Don't let the flames build any higher! Fire! Get out of here now! I heard the fuse started it! I will drive out the imposters. I have removed the bolt. I advise you leave that place before the flames reach you! I will be waiting here. For the end of this story. I must make clear which one of us is the fake! Or my life will not even begin. You damn hound! Stay where you are, i will put you down! I'd like to at least choose how I die. I didn't think being alone felt so cold... Ow, ow! We don't have the time to be fussing about with fire!! Put it out quick! Sprint to the well! Commissioner, sir! If you're really a samurai, untie the women and children at least! They're just gonna burn to death! Tokugawa does not discriminate among those who oppose it. If you don't want to burn... I can lop off these branches and your head at the same time. Dad! Now, I can't let that one go! Cherry blossoms may stand and wait for their petals to scatter, but if that is the way of a samurai, it's the most pathetic thing I ever heard. He is the jobless ronin who dispatched the fuse in Naka. Amusing. Draw, you impudent fool! D-Dousetsu... No more installments. From now on, I will give and take everything owed in one lump sum! Attack! They aren't dead. Don't panic. Oy, local hero! Dousetsu! Open all the gates, and we'll all carry the moat water in together. You think I will take orders from plebeians?! You blockhead! You blockhead! This is not a time or situation to be discriminating over status! Carry it!! Wind... It's going to fan the flames. We'll need all your help. Sure! Shino!! Shino!! Murasamemaru has chosen me. Welcome to the Forest of Fuse. You must be the last one? What do I have to do, bark? I have been waiting for you a long time. Your white fur is very pretty. If I eat your life-orb, it will become even shinier. Now, let us bring the end to what has been started. Of course. Glistening when drawn, O great blade of justice! It shall reap your head!! Perish, fuse!! This has all been wrong since my daughter conceived the child of a dog! And that's your excuse for killing my kind?! Accept it! Then you will not fear the future! Silence, imposter! What is that? Your kind were a mistake, born wrongly into this world! Born wrongly into this world... such a thing has never been!! This blade alone chose me! You're not the only one who's been fighting desperately for his people! You think that killing me, a counterfeit, will make you a proper Shogun?! Precisely!! Offer your life to those who are authentic!! Even an imposter is real if he lives in earnest! Even I... concealed myself in the castle... concealed myself from my people... discarded the self. I don't want it. If I eat your life-orb, i see myself becoming as much of a wreck as you. Otai, I already piled up Bakin's manuscripts. Go give a shout to Meido. The flames will be here soon. This blasted yomihon. It should burn with the rest of the place. In writing the Hakkenden yomihon, I wanted to establish fuse as right and proper. I wanted to give them a place. And yet, no matter how much I wrote, in the end, stories were nothing more than shams! I'm so sorry, Omichi. Sorry to you all. Move it! Move it! The fire's spread that way! Don't let it spook you! And the fuse? Farewell, all those I loved. I shall live away from the Castle. Don't go!! Hunter girl... Itezuru and Shinbee weren't eating life-orbs... They were cheering each other up with letters and trying to resist it! You have to have this! Hurry!! I can't... My foot... won't hold! You were holding it in for me, trying not to eat life-orbs, weren't you? That's what you called me out after the play to tell me, isn't it? Just stop. Only I am doomed to die. Don't feel guilty about surviving. Shino... I love you. If it gets too much to bear, you can eat my life-orb. Will you... stay connected to me forever? Yeah. I won't kill anymore. Can we call it even? Tear down that police box while there's still time! We'll check it from spreading! Thank goodness. It's a sudden shower. The sky's crying. They call these tears of joy. Yeaahh! Hamaji... He's gone. He left me here, in the same place we met. He'll come back, though, right? Hey, Meido? Would you teach me how to write? Sure. But why? I was thinking about writing him a letter. Look at that, Hamaji! Oh, wow! Meido! Come on, are you nearly ready? We need to get going! Go ahead of me! I'll be right after you! "Inga". Cause and effect. "In" is the start of things, and "ga" is their end. It takes both to form a story. I can't think of a conclusion!! Funamushi opened a cafe. Her fluffy egg clam parcels gained popularity quickly, and she even receives regulars from mansions and temples. Every day is busy. Come on, guys, bunch up more! Where am I, where am I... Boooo! Count to ten. Okay. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Stop moving... Stay still, would ya! Ow! He couldn't become an officer, but Dousetsu is now a dual-wielding samurai, commanding both a pellet and a bamboocopter. What do you say, my Lord? A drink before the fireworks? You are a shinobi. I hardly think it is befitting to become rowdy. I think I will. Even I would like to unwind sometimes. Come now, fill it up. The fires and quarrels for which Edo is so well known died down, and the Era of Tokugawa returned to stability. The eight fuse was firmly apprehended, and its head placed on display. Worry not. To my eyes, it is a grotesque head, severed brutally at neck. I pray that people will always have dogs by their side. So, I'll write the next part of the story, then! Coming and going between fiction and reality requires resolve, you know. I'm ready for it. There she is... I knew it. She climbed all the way up there again! So what is it? Brought me a scoop? Something funny? Don't tease, just tell me already, Hamaji! You won't put it in the kawaraban? I won't, I won't! I've never done anything like that! I got a reply! From Shino! It's started! A letter arrived from the fuse. Perfect. That will be the "effect" of this book, yes, its conclusion.
