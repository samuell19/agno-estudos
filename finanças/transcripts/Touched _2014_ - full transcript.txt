- HI. HI, SORRY I'M LATE. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE FINDING THE ROAD. - HEY, LISTEN, IT'S VERY EASY TO MISS. I'M HENRY. THIS IS MY WIFE, MARIA. - HELLO, I'M-- - AMBER FELLS. - MM-HMM. - YOU'RE 30 MINUTES LATE. - THE NORA BOSWELL? MY FRIENDS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT. I'VE READ ALL OF HER BOOKS. TWICE. IN COLLEGE, I-- - GOOD LUCK. - OH. - GREETINGS. - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. - I'M DR. BECK, MS. BOSWELL'S PERSONAL PHYSICIAN. I SEE BY YOUR RESUME YOU'RE VERY EXPERIENCED. - YES, I--I'VE WORKED IN A PRIVATE HOSPITAL, ST. GEORGE, AND AS A TRAVEL NURSE FOR THREE YEARS. - WHY DON'T YOU GO MEET MS. BOSWELL? - IT IS SUCH AN HONOR. YOUR BOOKS ARE AMAZING. - WELL, I DON'T DO THAT MUCH ANYMORE. - IS IT REALLY TRUE? I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED EPIC JUST LYING AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE? - GET OUT. - MS. BOSWELL, I-- - GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, NOW! - TWO AND A HALF MINUTES. - I TOLD YOU SHE WOULDN'T LAST FIVE. MM-HMM. FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. - LEAVE, NOW! - THANK YOU. - PLEASE LEAVE, NOW. - I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T CARE FOR HER MYSELF LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE AND ADMINISTER WHATEVER MEDICATION NEEDS ADMINISTERING. - WELL, THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. - DIFFERENT HOW? - WE NEED A PROFESSIONAL. - EMMA KEATING. - YES, WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. COME ON IN. - GOOD AFTERNOON. - LONG DRIVE? - 2 HOURS, 25 MINUTES. - CAN I GET YOU SOME COFFEE? - I'D LIKE TO MEET THE PATIENT NOW. - RIGHT THIS WAY THEN. - GOOD AFTERNOON. - DR. BECK? - EMMA KEATING, IT'S A PLEASURE. - I SEE YOU'VE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF NURSES. - LET'S GO MEET MS. BOSWELL. MS. BOSWELL, MEET EMMA KEATING. - GOOD AFTERNOON. - PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. - OKAY, SO, MS. BOSWELL, WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS WITH HOME NURSING CARE? - IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I WOULDN'T WANT A PRIVATE NURSE. - WHAT AM I DOING HERE? - I DON'T KNOW. - DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR DUTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO GENERAL CARE. NOW, IF YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THE TRIAL PERIOD AND BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO PROCEED TO A LONGER-TERM CONTRACT, MS. BOSWELL'S CURRENT MEDICAL CONDITION AND DETAILED HISTORY WILL BE PROVIDED. - UNDERSTOOD. MEANWHILE, I THINK WE SHOULD GET SOME FRESH AIR HAPPENING IN HERE. - NO. - NO MATTER YOUR CURRENT MEDICAL CONDITION OR YOUR DETAILED PERSONAL HISTORY, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME? - WELL, THEN, I THINK WE CAN PROCEED TO THE TRIAL PHASE, ASSUMING, OF COURSE, YOU AGREE TO THE PRELIMINARY CONDITIONS. - WELL, FOR THE RATE YOU'RE OFFERING, I'D BE CRAZY NOT TO GIVE IT A SHOT. - [chuckles] - I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOW ME TO MY ROOM. - OF COURSE. AFTER YOU. I TRUST THE SPACE WILL BE SUFFICIENT. - WELL, IT'S NICER THAN MY APARTMENT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE? - I'VE BEEN THE COOK AND HEAD MATRON SINCE MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY. SHE HAD THE JOB BEFORE ME. - WELL, JUST LIKE ME. - EXCUSE ME? - WELL, WE BOTH, YOU KNOW, CARE FOR OTHERS. - I IMAGINE THIS MUST BE QUITE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU. - HOW'S THAT? - TO CARE FOR SOMEONE LIKE MS. BOSWELL. - I DON'T CARE FOR SOMEONE DIFFERENTLY JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH. - YOU'LL FIND EVERYTHING YOU NEED AS FAR AS FOOD AND LAUNDRY SERVICES DOWNSTAIRS. I WON'T BE TENDING TO ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL NECESSITIES. - I'M PRETTY SELF-SUFFICIENT. - I'M SURE. - I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS. - BUT YOU WON'T BE HERE LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER THAT WELL. [knock at door] - WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? - CHECKING TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. - I WAS SLEEPING. - IT'S 10:00. - SO? - SO IT'S TIME TO GET UP. - NOBODY TELLS ME WHEN TO GET UP. - WHY SO LATE? - I'M TIRED. - WHY SO TIRED? - I'M OLD. - YOU'RE NOT THAT OLD. I BROUGHT YOU SOME O.J. - I DON'T DRINK O.J. - FINE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST? - MARIA BRINGS ME MY BREAKFAST WHEN I ASK HER TO. - LOOK, DRINK THIS AND I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A WHOLE HOUR. - I'M NOT A BABY. - I KNOW. BUT I'M BEING PAID TO CARE FOR YOU TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND, PRESUMABLY, IMPROVE YOUR CONDITION. - I DRINK COFFEE IN THE MORNING. COFFEE. - IT'S THIS OR GREEN TEA. - OH, GIVE ME THAT GLASS. I BELIEVE I FIND YOU QUITE INTOLERABLE. - OH, WELL, IT'S JUST THE FIRST DAY. - OH. - HEY. WHAT ARE YOU PLANTING? - AH, TODAY IS A GOOD DAY. I GET TO PLANT MY SUNFLOWERS. - [chuckles] - DO YOU GARDEN? - I CAN'T SAY THAT I DO, NO. - SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THESE ARE OVERUSED, TOO COMMON, VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN POPULARITY, BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN MS. BOSWELL'S FAVORITE TOO. - HOW LONG DO THEY LAST? - OH, JUST THE SUMMER SEASON. - AREN'T THERE ONES THAT GROW BY THEMSELVES YEAR AFTER YEAR? - SURE, PERENNIALS. BUT I ENJOY THE CYCLE, YOU KNOW, WATCHING THEM GROW TALL, THRIVE, AND THEN FADE AWAY. PLUS, IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO. - CAN'T IMAGINE YOU'D BE BORED LOOKING AFTER THIS PLACE, THOUGH. - YEAH, I LOVE IT HERE. - SO I TAKE IT MS. BOSWELL DOESN'T WRITE ANYMORE. - OH, SHE HASN'T HAD A BOOK OUT IN OVER 10 YEARS. - WHY IS THAT? - WELL, A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED IN NORMA'S LIFE AROUND THAT TIME. I MEAN THE ACCIDENT, OF COURSE. - WHAT ACCIDENT? - CAR ACCIDENT. HER AND HER HUSBAND, SAMUEL. OH, IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. A TRUCK BLINDSIDED THEM. KILLED SAM INSTANTLY. YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT? IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS. - UM, I GUESS I MUST HAVE MISSED IT. - [sighs] [keys clacking] - "NORMA BOSWELL IS AN AMERICAN AUTHOR "OF EPIC TALES OF LOVE AND TRAGEDY. "TRAGEDY BECAME A REALITY FOR BOSWELL "IN HER HORRIFIC ACCIDENT. "AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL, "SHE BECAME AN ALMOST TOTAL RECLUSE, VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARING." ME AGAIN. - [groans] - GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. - OH. - HEY. WOULD YOU LIKE A SANDWICH? - LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DONE. - DR. BECK. - MS. BOSWELL AND I WILL NEED TO BE ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. - OH, YOU'RE SURE I CAN'T GIVE YOU A HAND WITH SOMETHING? - NO, THANK YOU. NOT UNTIL YOUR TRIAL IS COMPLETE. STILL A FEW MORE DAYS. - [sighs] [metal clatters] - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. - WHO ARE YOU? - WHO ARE YOU? - I ASKED YOU FIRST. - ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? - I'M JUSTIN. BOSWELL? - OH. - JUST GOT BACK IN TOWN AND ALREADY CAUSING A RUCKUS. - SORRY, I WAS GONNA GET SOMETHING TO EAT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE ANYBODY UP. - SO MUCH FOR THAT. - LOOKS LIKE IT. - I'LL FIX YOU YOUR FAVORITE. - I MISSED YOU. SO WHAT'S YOUR DEAL? - LATEST ATTEMPT AT A PRIVATE NURSE. - I'M GONNA GO BACK TO BED. - GOOD NIGHT... KILLER. HEY. - OH, I AM SO SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. I FEEL TERRIBLE. - NO, I WAS IMPRESSED. HARD-CORE. MY MOTHER SHOULD PAY YOU AS A SECURITY GUARD TOO. - RIGHT. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT? - LAUNDRY ROOM. - MARIA DOESN'T DO IT FOR YOU? - I THINK I CAN DO MY OWN LAUNDRY. - HMM. - SO I SEE YOU LIKE TO SLEEP LATE LIKE YOUR MOTHER. - I'M A LITTLE JET-LAGGED. - OH. WHERE ARE YOU COMING FROM? - SPAIN, GERMANY, FRANCE, PORTUGAL ON THE WAY BACK THROUGH. - WOW. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE? - A LITTLE OF THIS, A LITTLE OF THAT. BUSINESS AND PLEASURE. - LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE A WRITER TOO? - I AM A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK. - DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW YOU'RE HOME? - NOT JUST YET, THOUGH I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED TO FIND OUT. LET'S NOT VEX HER WITH ALL THAT EXCITEMENT. OUR PATHS WILL CROSS SOON ENOUGH. UNTIL THEN, REST. - OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA LIFT OUR ARMS UP, REACH FOR THE SKY. OKAY, YOU'RE NOT REACHING. REACH. - FOR GOODNESS' SAKE. - YOU KNOW, WE COULD MOVE THIS OUTSIDE, EVEN ON TO THE PORCH. IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. - I DON'T GET THE POINT OF ALL THIS. - WELL, IT INCREASES YOUR BLOOD FLOW, OXYGEN TO THE HEART, ELONGATES YOUR SPINE. - OH, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LET ME BE? - I TOLD YOU. MY PLAN HERE IS TO INCREASE YOUR HEALTH TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. - IT'S ALL A CHARADE. - WELL, AS YOU KNOW MY TRIAL PERIOD IS COMING TO AN END, SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO LET ME GO, NOW IS YOUR BIG CHANCE. - I DON'T NEED A BIG CHANCE. - FINE. LET'S GO DO SOME MORE EXERCISES. GONNA DO SOME ARM CIRCLES NOW. SO JUST OUT TO THE SIDE. - THIS IS INTOLERABLE. - IF I'M SO INTOLERABLE, WHY HAVE YOU KEPT ME AROUND? - I'M REALLY CURIOUS. - OKAY, REVERSE DIRECTION NOW. - YOU DON'T POSSESS ANY KIND OF PERSONAL AGENDA WHATSOEVER. YOU TREAT ME AS A... - AS ANY OF MY PATIENTS? - AS IF I DON'T HOLD YOUR FAITH IN THE PALM OF MY HAND. - OKAY, LET'S JUST DO SOME MORE EXERCISES, OKAY? - I'D BE WILLING TO BET THAT YOU HAVE NO HUSBAND, NO FAMILY OF YOUR OWN. - YOU BET RIGHT. - AND NO BOYFRIEND. - NO. - SO YOU COME HERE VALIANTLY AND DEVOTE YOURSELF BLINDLY AND STOICALLY TO YOUR DUTY WITH NO HEED WHATSOEVER TO ANYTHING OUTSIDE THAT NARROW COMPASS. - WHAT, YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME LIKE SOME KIND OF SAINT OR SOMETHING? - I THINK IT MAKES YOU A DUNCE. - [huffs] WELL, SINCE I'M SO SIMPLE, MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME. YOUR SON JUST ARRIVED HOME FROM ABROAD, AND YET NEITHER OF YOU HAVE SAID HELLO TO EACH OTHER. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY SIMPLE BRAIN TO UNDERSTAND. - OUT OF MY HOUSE. - IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE. - HEY. EMMA? [tires screech] - HEY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - YOU CAN SEND ME MY CHECK FOR THE WEEK. - SHE FIRED YOU? - IN SO MANY WORDS. - JUST NOW? WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. - [sighs] - LET ME TALK TO HER. PLEASE. MS. BOSWELL APOLOGIZES. SHE WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY ON. HER OUTBURSTS ARE-- - HER OUTBURSTS ARE NOT WHAT'S BOTHERING ME. WHAT'S BOTHERING ME IS, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. - I UNDERSTAND, AT TIMES, MS. BOSWELL CAN BE DIFFICULT AND RATHER ECCENTRIC. BUT SHE'S VERY DEAR TO ME, AND SHE'S VERY ILL. MS. BOSWELL WAS DIAGNOSED WITH M.S. WHEN SHE WAS IN HER MID 30s. - I FOUND ONE OF HER COPAXONE CAPSULES SO... - YES. WELL, EARLY LAST MONTH, SHE HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED DUE TO ABNORMAL SYMPTOMS. AN M.R.I. OF HER BRAIN REVEALED PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALITIS. - SO WHAT TREATMENT IS SHE RECEIVING? - FOR THE P.M.L., NOTHING. - NOTHING? - SHE REFUSED FOR FEAR OF ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. AFTER THE SCENE AT THE HOSPITAL, I WAS BARELY ABLE TO CONVINCE HER TO CONTINUE WITH THE MODIFIED TREATMENT FOR M.S. SHE DOESN'T TRUST THE MEDICINE OR THE DOCTOR. - BUT THERE ARE VALID TREATMENT OPTIONS OUT THERE. - MS. BOSWELL'S MIND IS SET. SHE WANTS TO LET THINGS RUN THEIR COURSE. FORTUNATELY, THE SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY MILD UP TO THIS POINT, BUT THE STORM IS COMING. - SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR PALLIATIVE CARE. - IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR YOU? - NO, BUT WHAT ABOUT HER FAMILY? - WELL, THERE'S ONLY JUSTIN. SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO KNOW. SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW. AS OF NOW, IT'S JUST THE HOSPITAL STAFF, MYSELF, AND HER ATTORNEY. I MUST INSIST NOW THAT YOU SIGN OUR CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL BONUS ON TOP OF YOUR BASE RATE IF YOU REACH THE... CESSATION OF LIFE. ALSO NOTE THE CLAUSE THAT STATES WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU BREAK OUR AGREEMENT. - "DISCLOSURE OF ANY OF MS. BOSWELL'S "PRIVATE INFORMATION BY THE PARTY, "INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO "MS. BOSWELL'S PERSONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION "WILL IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE EMPLOYMENT, "VOIDING ANY MONETARY INCENTIVES "AND RENDERING THE PARTY VULNERABLE TO PUNITIVE LEGAL ACTION." - IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH? - HOW LONG? - EXCUSE ME? - HOW LONG DOES SHE HAVE? - WITHOUT TREATMENT FOR THE VIRUS, A MONTH. - WELL, I REALLY DIDN'T APOLOGIZE. - NORMA. - THE GOOD DOCTOR FEARS THAT WE'VE LOST OUR CANDIDATE, SO MAYBE HE'S JUST TIRED OF LOOKING AFTER ME HIMSELF. - EMMA HAS AGREED TO ALL OF OUR CONDITIONS. SHE SIGNED OUR AGREEMENTS. NORMA? - OKAY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO MY HOME. WE'RE SO PLEASED AND FORTUNATE TO HAVE YOU. LA-DEE-DAH. - [clears throat] YES, I DID SIGN YOUR PAPERS, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IN THEM. - WHAT? PRAY, TELL ME. I'LL ELUCIDATE FOR YOU. - WELL, WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL YOUR FAMILY? I GET WHY YOU DON'T WANT IT OUT THERE FOR THE PRESS TURNING IT INTO SOME BIG NEWS STORY, BUT YOUR OWN SON. EVEN HENRY AND MARIA. - YOU DON'T HAVE A SHRED OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY. - FAIR ENOUGH. BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONDITIONS OF MY OWN. - THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD. - I THINK WE SHOULD FULLY VET ALL THE TREATMENT OPTIONS. - AS I SAID, WE'VE, OF COURSE, DISCUSSED THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE, AND MS. BOSWELL HAS ELECTED TO... - I'D LIKE TO LIVE IN A RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE STATE UNTIL I EXPIRE. - WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S NOT ONE OF YOUR OPTIONS. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICINE, THE SYMPTOMS OF YOUR DISEASE ARE GONNA GET FAR WORSE AS IT PROGRESSES. QUITE FRANKLY, I THINK YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE FAIRED SO WELL UP UNTIL THIS POINT. - I'M NOT SURE THE WORD "LUCKY" IS APPROPRIATE HERE. - ALL I'M SAYING IS, THERE'S SOME INNOVATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS OUT THERE. - YOU'RE JUST A NURSE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - I CAN DO SOME MORE RESEARCH, WEIGH OUR OPTIONS AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU SAY, NORMA? - AT LEAST KEEP AN OPEN MIND. [kettle whistling] - [clears throat] IT'S JUST ME. IT'S GOOD IN HERE. IT'S SAFE. SO YOU SURVIVED. - APPARENTLY SO. - HEY, I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE FOR A BIT, HEAD INTO TOWN, SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME TROUBLE TO GET INTO. CARE TO JOIN? - I DON'T THINK SO. - COME ON, YOU'VE BEEN COOPED UP HERE THE WHOLE TIME. YOU MUST WANT TO ESCAPE THIS DUNGEON FOR A WHILE. - DUNGEON? - DON'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE ANY FUN? - MY JOB HERE IS 24/7. - YOU'RE NEVER GONNA PLEASE HER, YOU KNOW. - I'M NOT TRYING TO PLEASE HER. - NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, HOW HARD YOU TRY, YOU WON'T BE GOOD ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT, LAST SHOT. TAKE A RIDE WITH ME. - YOU'RE USED TO GETTING WHAT YOU WANT, AREN'T YOU? - OUCH. YOU PRETTY MUCH JUST SAY WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND. DON'T YOU? - MM-HMM. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TWO, ANYWAY? - EXCUSE ME? - YOU AND YOUR MOTHER. - YOU'VE SEEN THE WAY SHE IS. - RELATIONSHIPS ARE A TWO-WAY STREET LAST TIME I CHECKED. - IF ANYBODY'S USED TO GETTING THEIR WAY, IT'S MY MOTHER, AND LET'S JUST SAY SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY GET WHAT SHE WANTED WITH ME. - [sniffs] GOOD MORNING. - OH, GOOD MORNING. - TIME FOR YOUR DAILY COPAXONE. - OH, WHAT JOY. [chuckles] OH, WHERE'S DR. BECK? - HE WON'T BE COMING IN TODAY. I'LL BE ADMINISTERING YOUR SHOTS FOR YOUR M.S. FROM NOW ON. YOU'RE READING ALL YOUR OWN BOOKS? - NO, I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT MOST OF THESE IN YEARS. I'M JUST SKIMMING THROUGH TO SEE WHAT'S LEFT OF ME AFTER I--I'M GONE. - THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE WITH ALL THAT. - I AM. WHAT KIND OF MORBID PERSON FASHIONS THEIR EXISTENCE ISOLATING THEMSELVES WITH SICKNESS AND DEATH? - WELL, WE CAN'T ALL BE GREAT ARTISTS. - WELL, THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER PALATABLE WAY THAT AN ATTRACTIVE, INTELLIGENT YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOURSELF CAN MAKE ENDS MEET. - I THOUGHT I WAS SIMPLE AND A DUNCE. - WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? - UM... - I MEAN REALLY WANT. - WELL, ONE DAY, I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP MY OWN INPATIENT FACILITY FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL. - OH, THAT SOUNDS DREADFUL. WHAT DOES ALL THIS STEM FROM? I MEAN, ARE YOU DEALING WITH SOME GUILT FROM YOUR PAST? BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS-- - WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MY MOTHER RIGHT NOW. - WHAT IS YOUR DREAM? - READY? - YUP. [needle clicks] - HAVE YOU EVER EVEN CONSIDERED IT, OR IS IT TRUE THAT YOU ARE A WOEFUL, SELFLESS SLAVE TO WORK? - [sighs] TRAVEL I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - WELL, IN SEVENTH GRADE, WE WENT ON A SCHOOL TRIP TO SEE MOUNT RUSHMORE. - I'M SORRY I ASKED. WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO? - EUROPE. ITALY, MOSTLY. I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE. - YES, I'VE BEEN TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD AND SOME UNCIVILIZED. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO READ ONE OF MY BOOKS. - WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT I THINK? - I DON'T. I JUST SAID I'D LIKE YOU TO READ IT. - IS THIS PART OF MY JOB? - IF IT PLEASES YOU TO THINK SO. - UH... OKAY. [plate shatters] - OH. - OH, HERE. LET ME HELP YOU. - THANK YOU. - HEY. - HELLO. WOW, BEAUTIFUL CAR. - YEAH, SHE'S BEEN IN STORAGE FOREVER. I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOT AT GETTING HER UP AND RUNNING AGAIN. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARS? - NOT REALLY. - MY DAD SURE KNEW ABOUT CARS. HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO TEACH ME, BUT I WAS JUST NEVER TOO INTERESTED AT THE TIME. - I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOUR DAD. - HE WAS COOL. A REAL EVEN-KEELED GUY, AND I GUESS HE WAS THE GLUE OF OUR FAMILY BECAUSE SINCE HE'S BEEN GONE, EVERYTHING JUST FELL APART. HOW ABOUT YOU? YOUR FAMILY AS MESSED UP AS MINE? - MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. - SORRY. - SHE WAS SICK FOR MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF RESOURCES. CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW, I--SHE WOULD HAVE LIVED FOR A LITTLE LONGER. - HOW ABOUT YOUR DAD? - HE TOOK OFF. COULDN'T HANDLE THE TOUGH STUFF. LEFT US TO DEAL WITH IT ON OUR OWN. - I GUESS SOME PEOPLE DEAL WITH THINGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. - AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T DEAL WITH THEM AT ALL. YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING DOWN THERE? - YES, I GOT IT. I AM A MANLY MAN. - HERE WE GO. READY? ONE, TWO, THREE. [groans] - OH, WOW, OKAY. - IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. OPEN UP. LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S FINE. I CAN FIX THAT. WE'LL JUST CLEAN IT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE CUT. JUSTIN? JUSTIN? JUSTIN, HEY. HEY. RELAX. YOU HAD A BIT OF A FALL. - DID I PASS OUT? - DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL SURVIVE. I CLEANED IT AND PUT A BUTTERFLY ON IT. I DON'T THINK A STITCH THERE IS GONNA DO IT ANY GOOD. - [groans] - YOU SHOULD HAVE LET HENRY HELP YOU. - OH, I'D BE GLAD TO LOOK AT IT TOMORROW IF YOU'D LIKE. - I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A SHOT. - DO YOU ALWAYS PASS OUT WHEN YOU SEE BLOOD? - ONLY WHEN IT'S MINE. - YOU'RE A BIG BABY. - AND YOU ARE MY HERO. - [chuckles] - OH, WHAT HAPPENED? - OH, IT'S FINE. HE JUST-- - I WAS WORKING ON DAD'S MUSTANG. - YOU NEVER FINISH ANYTHING. - DON'T START, MOM. PLEASE. - YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S NO POINT IN TRYING TO MOTIVATE YOU. IT'S LIKE SQUEEZING BLOOD OUT OF A STONE. - MOTIVATE ME? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT? HOW ABOUT BEATING ME DOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL. - OH, GROW UP, JUSTIN. - YOU'RE LOCKED UP HERE IN THIS CASTLE. - I'M IN PAIN. - SO AM I. - OH. OH. - MOM. - NORMA. - MOM, MOM. - GET AWAY FROM ME. - OKAY. HENRY, LET'S GET HER UPSTAIRS. - WE GOT YOU. - [groans] - THE SYMPTOMS WILL ONLY GET WORSE FROM HERE EXPONENTIALLY. WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING, NORMA. - TELL HER ABOUT THE CYTORBENOL AC. - WHAT'S THAT? - IT'S A CHEMO DRUG USED TO TREAT CERTAIN CANCERS. IT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED EXPERIMENTALLY, BUT WITH SOME SUCCESS. - I REFUSE. - WE CAN DO THE TREATMENTS HERE INTRAVENOUSLY. - THE VIRUS WILL KILL ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. - BUT THESE TREATMENTS COULD HELP YOU PERSEVERE THROUGH THE SUMMER INTO THE FALL. - IT IS A SYSTEMIC TREATMENT. AND, YES, YOU COULD VERY WELL EXPERIENCE ADVERSE SYMPTOMS, BUT THE TREATMENTS WOULD, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, INCREASE YOUR LIFE. - A LONGER PERIOD IN WHICH TO SUFFER. - MS. BOSWELL, AT LEAST GIVE YOURSELF A FIGHTING CHANCE. - [chuckles] - THIS IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, NORMA. - [sighs] GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? - READY TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN. WHAT'S WITH THE FLOWERS? - EMMA STARTED BRINGING THEM IN. THOUGHT THEY WERE A NICE TOUCH. - OATMEAL AND O.J. AGAIN. HOW DELICIOUS. WHERE IS MY CROISSANTS? - YOU NEED MORE FIBER. - WHY DOES EVERYBODY LOVE TO TELL ME WHAT I NEED? SOMETHING ELSE, MARIA? - I-- I'LL BE BACK WITH YOUR SUPPER LATER. - SO I FINISHED GONE AND FOREVER. - AND DID IT MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS? - WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. - WELL, DID YOU LIKE THE BOOK? PLEASE, DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO GUSH. - I'M NOT A LITERARY CRITIC. - SPIT IT OUT. - I THOUGHT IT WAS DEPRESSING. - NO EMOTIONAL OR INTELLECTUAL CATHARSIS, JUST PURE DRIVEL? - THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. - OF COURSE IT MUST BE DRIVEL. IT ONLY WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD, TRANSLATED INTO 24 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, AND SOLD 15 MILLION COPIES. - LOOK, YOU ASKED ME TO READ IT. I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT I THOUGHT. - WELL, LUCKY FOR ME I LEARNED LONG AGO TO DISCOUNT OUTSIDE CRITICISM AND PRAISE. - [sighs] SO HAVE YOU DECIDED? BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TREATMENT A.S.A.P. WE'VE WAITED FAR TOO LONG ALREADY. SO TO PREPARE, WE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT-- - I'M NOT DOING IT. - FINE. YOU WANT TO SIT UP HERE WASTING AWAY YOUR FINAL DAYS IN SOLITUDE AND SELF-PITY, FIND YOURSELF ANOTHER NURSE. AND I KNOW YOU THINK YOU'RE STRONG AND YOU DON'T NEED ANYONE ELSE, BUT I DON'T BUY IT. - I'M IN CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION. - YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL OF ANYTHING, AND THAT'S WHAT SCARES YOU. - HOW DARE YOU! - YOU'RE SELFISH, AND YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A COWARD. AND YOU'RE ASKING ME TO STAND HERE WITH MY HANDS TIED AND WATCH YOU DIE? I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. - [screams] - YEAH. WELL, I'M STAYING AT A MOTEL TONIGHT, BUT I'VE SUBLET MY PLACE IN THE INTERIM, SO... YEAH, OKAY. SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT LIST TO ME TOMORROW, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. [phone beeps] - OH, HANG ON. I GOT ANOTHER CALL. THANK YOU. BYE. [phone beeps] HELLO? - EMMA, DR. BECK. NOT TOO MANY NURSES WOULD WALK AWAY FROM $4,000 A WEEK. - IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY FOR ME. IT NEVER WAS. - I'VE BEEN NORMA'S DOCTOR FOR A LONG TIME. SHE'S BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO ME, BUT I ALSO KNOW HOW SHE CAN BE. SHE'S PROBABLY THE MOST STUBBORN WOMAN I'VE EVER MET. BUT BENEATH ALL THAT SARCASM AND BRISTLE, THERE'S A LOVING, COMPASSIONATE, BRILLIANT PERSON. SHE'S JUST BEEN THROUGH A LOT. - A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. - NORMA'S AT THE MOST UNHAPPY STATE OF HER ENTIRE LIFE. EVEN AFTER SAMUEL DIED, IT WAS SHOCK AND DEPRESSION, BUT NOW, IT'S AS IF SHE FEELS THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR HER. AND IF SHE DOESN'T LET GO SOON, IT'LL BE TOO LATE. - I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME. - I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN REACH HER. I MEAN, SHE LIKES BEING WITH YOU. SHE RUNS RIGHT OVER ME. SHE RUNS OVER EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU. HELP ME BUY NORMA SOME MORE TIME. - MS. BOSWELL HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT ME-- - SHE CHANGED HER MIND. - SHE CHANGED HER MIND? - SHE'S WILLING TO GIVE THE TREATMENT A TRY IF YOU COME BACK. - THERE IS NO ESCAPE. - APPARENTLY NOT. - WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO COME BACK? - CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF OUR AGREEMENT. - WOW, PLAYING HARD BALL WITH NORMA BOSWELL. COLOR ME IMPRESSED ONCE AGAIN. - IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT. - MAY I? - SURE. THANKS. - EITHER WAY, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE. - LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL DECISION FOR YOU, AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE ANY PERSONAL JUDGMENTS. SO FOR THAT, I AM SORRY. - WE'RE LIKE A COUPLE OF STUBBORN BIRDS, AREN'T WE? - YOU REALLY WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE THIS TREATMENT A SHOT? - YOUR CHOICE OF IDIOM MAKES ME CRINGE, BUT I SUPPOSE CLINGING TO A FEW MORE MISERABLE WEEKS MIGHT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. IF YOU SAY SO. BUT NO ONE CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS. - FOUR-WEEK CYCLES, THREE WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITH A WEEK OFF IN BETWEEN. - WELL, MAKE SURE THE DOOR REMAINS LOCKED AND THIS TORTURE DEVICE WELL HIDDEN. - ARE YOU READY, NORMA? - YES. - OKAY. YOU'RE GONNA FEEL A LITTLE STICK. - THIS IS COMPAZINE. YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS FOR NAUSEA AFTER THE TREATMENTS. - HERE WE GO. - UH-UH. - YOU KNOW, I THINK I'D LIKE TO READ ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR BOOKS. - [chuckles] YOU'RE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT. - WELL, I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THEM. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. - IT'S NOT THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF THE WORK THAT MATTERS. IT'S THE CREATION, THE AGONIZING FRUSTRATIONS, AND THE BLISSFUL DISCOVERIES. - THE PROCESS. BUT THERE'S STILL A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY TO DO THINGS, RIGHT? - HMM. I MEAN, THERE ARE PRINCIPLES OF STYLE AND FORM, OF COURSE, BUT WE'RE ALL ARTISTS. CHILDREN, REALLY. - WE TRY AND TRY, BUT WE CAN NEVER REACH THE END OF THE RAINBOW. THAT'S TRAGIC AND BEAUTIFUL. - SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A JOURNEY. - NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. MAKING ART IS THE PUREST FORM OF SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND REALIZATION. WHAT ABOUT YOU? - WHAT ABOUT ME? - WHY IS IT YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO CULTIVATE YOURSELF? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - WELL, YOU TALK ABOUT WANTING TO TRAVEL. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO BUSY WITH WORK. - WITH PATIENTS? - YES. - MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU'LL CARE FOR ENOUGH DYING PATIENTS SO YOU CAN OPEN YOUR OWN FACILITY IN ORDER TO HOUSE EVEN MORE PATHETIC SOULS. I BELIEVE YOU'D MAKE A GOOD CHARACTER IN ONE OF MY NOVELS. [chuckles] - OKAY, WE ARE OFFICIALLY INTO YOUR SECOND CYCLE. - A JUBILANT OCCASION. - WELL, I'VE NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE. YOUR MOTOR FUNCTIONALITY HAS IMPROVED. YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY. - A WHIRLING DERVISH. - YOU HAVEN'T COMPLAINED ABOUT YOUR HEADACHES FOR DAYS. - OH, IT'S BEING REPLACED BY A LOT OF NAUSEA. - OH, THAT REMINDS ME. IT'S TIME FOR YOUR COMPAZINE. - WHAT IS IT? - MOM? - COME BACK LATER. I'M BUSY. - I'M GOING INTO TOWN LATER. I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING, IF I COULD. - FINE. LET HIM IN. - THANK YOU, EMMA. - WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT? - I GOT A BIT OF GOOD NEWS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. - I DON'T HAVE GLASSES. JUST TELL ME, FOR PETE'S SAKE. - IT'S MY NOVELLA. IT'S GONNA BE PUBLISHED. - YOUR NOVELLA? - THE ONE I WAS WORKING ON OVERSEAS. IT'S BEEN ACCEPTED BY A BRITISH QUARTERLY FOR NEW FICTION. - IS THERE A CHANCE I'VE HEARD OF THIS BASTION OF ESTEEMED LITERATURE? YOUR USE OF MY NAME HAS GAINED YOU ENTRANCE TO THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOLS OF THE MOST ELITE ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL CIRCLES. BRAVO, SON. BRAVO. - [sighs] [melancholy music] ♪ THESE ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. - YEAH, YOU JUST TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA SOIL AND REALLY PACK IT IN AROUND THEM. - YEAH. - AND THEN THEY'LL GROW A LITTLE STRAIGHTER AND TALLER, OKAY? - I'LL GET THAT. - NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. - NOT A PROBLEM. I HAVE TO DO A COUPLE LOADS ANYWAY. - OH, WELL, THANK YOU. - I FIGURE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE OF SOME USE TO EACH OTHER. - UM, OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? - ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING TO GET AN UPDATE ON NORMA'S CONDITION. - NO, MARIA, I--I CAN'T. - I DON'T WANT TO BURDEN HER, AND I KNOW I'M NOT GETTING THE WHOLE STORY. - I REALLY CAN'T DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU. - SO THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING US. I ADMINISTERED HER MEDICATION FOR YEARS. - MARIA, PLEASE. - WHAT'S CHANGED? - I LEGALLY CANNOT DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU. - FINE. DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET A SECOND CHANCE WITH ME. - WHERE TO? - LOOKS LIKE BURKINA FASO. - YOU HAVEN'T REALLY DONE IT. - JUST PICKED AROUND A PLACE AND GONE THERE? MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT. YOU WANT TO COME? - UH, NO. - WHY NOT? - I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES. - HERE YOU GO. YOUR TURN. READY? OH, ITALY. - EVER BEEN? - MILAN, TRIESTE, ROME, FLORENCE, NAPLES, VENICE, VERONA. - VERONA? - IS THAT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO? - IT'D BE MY TOP CHOICE. - WELL, THEN I GUESS IT'S SETTLED. - SO WHAT MADE YOU START TRAVELING SO MUCH? - AFTER MY DAD DIED, I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO GET AWAY. - WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM? - WE WERE NEVER REALLY THAT CLOSE TO BEGIN WITH. MY DAD ALWAYS SAID IT WAS 'CAUSE WE'RE SO MUCH ALIKE, AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. - YEAH. - ANYWAY, SHE WAS IN A COMA. I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONE. I FELT LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE A HOME ANYMORE. AND WHEN SHE WOKE UP... - YOU WERE GONE. - I WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THERE WERE TROPICAL STORMS. IT TWO WEEKS TO GET BACK, AND WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL, I DON'T KNOW. SHE WOULDN'T LOOK AT ME THE SAME. SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW. - ABOUT WHAT? - I AM A CRUMMY WRITER. [both chuckle] - YOU SAID YOUR FATHER LEFT WHEN YOUR MOM GOT SICK. - YEAH. - DID HE EVER COME BACK? - AT THE FUNERAL. - WHAT'D HE SAY? - THERE'S NOTHING HE COULD HAVE SAID. SO... - THAT THE LAST TIME YOU EVER SAW HIM? - I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, BUT EMMA WON'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS. - SO YOU ASKED HER. - YES. SHE SAID SHE CAN'T DISCUSS IT.
