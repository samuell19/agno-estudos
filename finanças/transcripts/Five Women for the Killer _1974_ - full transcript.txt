‘Five Women For The Killer “There is an urgent communication for Mr. Giorgio Pisani..." “Will he please come to the information desk.” I'm Giorgio Pisani, I heard there's a communication for me. - Yes, there's a message. - Thank you. Hello? Hi, Erica, how are you? Is everything okay? The pains have stopped? Yes, of course I'm happy. You're alone? Isn't aunt Martha with you? You can't be left alone in your condition. I'm on my way. When did they start again? Then I'll call Lydia. No, it's okay I'll take care of it... Okay, just calm down. No, doctor Franzi isn't in the clinic. No, I wouldn't know. Okay, I'll tell her you called. - Please hurry. - Calm down... Fine father you'll be. You worry too much... - It won't be the first premature birth. - They said it would be difficult. As for this doctor Franzi, who I haven't had the honour of meeting... Look, sometimes these specialists... Isn't anyone with her? No one. We have an aunt staying with us... But she went out today. - That's Lydia's car! - Who's she? - Doctor Franzi. -You see? You see, there was no need to overreact. You're probably a father already, and you won't have to pay me my fee! Sounds like you're a father. Erica? Don't men wear black any more? Giorgio. That was quite a moving sermon, and you certainly didn't waste your words. I'm the brother of the deceased. My wife. Do you always have to behave like an idiot? You weren't a Christian couple, as I understand it... But even if you don't believe in God, you believed in love... And your son was bom out of an act of love... This child God has given you belongs to you and Erica. 1 didn't say these things in church... - 1 wanted to tell you in private. - Thank you. I'll drive, I have no intention of joining my sister. A desperate case is an ideal case in my point of view. Certainly the satisfaction will be greater when we save them. No, my dear, quite the opposite... It's ideal because he'll leave and our job will be done. Doctor... Perhaps you still don't know the terrible dilemma that tortures my soul. One of these days I'll invite you to dinner... And I'll open those beautiful eyes to the reality that faces mankind... There are too many of us, my dear! If we continue to multiply as we are doing now... There will be a day when there are two people for every square metre... You know what that means? We'll be like this, tight! You know what the solution is? Your sacristy... It's simple: Herod: The massacre of the innocents! -Yes? - He's the father. You're the father. My compliments. 1 was joking, of course. 1 was being absurd... We'll do everything we can for him, and we'll also do the impossible! Goodbye. Don't pay any attention to what he says... He's a character, like most head physicians... But he's an excellent paediatrician. In fact, he's one of the best in Europe. You see, Lydia, if that boy were to die... - It would be like Erica dying a second time. - Don't worry, he'll live. - Do you want to wait in my office? - Yes, of course. Bring him here. Let's see what's wrong with this one... Take him next door and give him some drops, they won't do him any harm. ‘Diagnosis: Hereditary sterile impotence... ‘Doctor Lydia Franzi' What is this nonsense that 1 can't have children? - Who made this ridiculous diagnosis? - How did you get that? - It doesn't matter now. -1 have to know! Okay, it was on the table and I opened it... - But I have the right to an explanation? - It's the truth, Giorgio... What you just read... You may be the most virile man in the world but you're incapable of procreating. But how? When Erica and I did the tests you said everything was normal. I had already been married to Fabrizio for two years when you two got married... And I was well aware of their bigot of a father and his sense of morality... Having children was one of his conditions... And you know the results of the test. 1 was very close to you and Erica... 1 knew the old man would have objected if he knew the truth... So I took the initiative and showed you a false report. Then the boy isn't mine. I repeat, I took Mr. Pisani's file because the professor wanted to see it... - Then I put it back. - Where? On my desk... - On display for everyone to see. - No, in the filing cabinet, I'm sure of it... And that's what I'll tell the professor if you plan on bringing it up. The professor! Of course! Okay, you can go. Good moming, Martha. Any news about the boy? - I've changed. - Why? - I feel so different, happy! - That's partly down to me as well. Of course! It's also because of you... And I'm grateful. Just think Giorgio, we're going to have a baby... A child of our own. Just think Giorgio, we're going to have a baby... A child of our own. Good evening. No, don't move! I'll get someone from the clinic. - There's no need. - Are you sure? Of course. But if you really want to do something for me, please take me home. You know I try to read a lot to better understand you language. ‘With gratitude and sympathy, Giorgio Pisani' 1 don't understand? We only just met. Why with gratitude and sympathy? Because it's the readers who buy my books that allow me to eam a living. Just think, I bought this book because I thought it was an erotic novel! I've met businessmen in Italy, footballers, directors... Priests, actors... You're the first writer I've met. All the people I know say; I'm a famous designer, I'm a famous director... I've got this, I've got that, 1 can do all this for you... The truth is they just want to sleep with me. Foreigners do very well here because you think they're all whores... But I'm not. You see? It's quite nice here, isn't it? My friend pays for it, so if I don't like someone, I don't have to sleep with them. Great, isn't it? - And your friend thinks you're faithful? - Of course! You men are so easy to fool. Don't you want to? Don't you like me? - Problems? -Yes... - They're also quite serious. - And what do I tell poor Tiffany? 1 found out that I'm pregnant tonight. Just one cut, from bottom to top... From the clitoris to the sternum. And she was also pregnant, it's written here as well. And that's the signature. Or a symbol the Killer wanted to leave as his calling card. Well? Have you figured it out? No. But it all makes me think the murderer came here without intending to kill. Palumbo... Come on, get back to work. Otherwise they would've brought something more appropriate than a paper cutter... 1 just don't get it. But why mutilate her womb like that? You think the fact that she was pregnant might have something to do with it? I'm willing to bet on it! - Did he come today? - Good moming. Yes, he's on the track. You can wait for him in the pit. The rear suspension is too hard. - You almost ran me over. - Then don't get in my way. It's been a while. I thought you'd come to Erica's funeral. They fired me the next day. My sister should have left an envelope with you... I believe she told Lydia, or at least... She said she was going to. Poor thing, must have been expecting it! That's none of your business. - 1 thought I was doing you a favour... - 1 don't want anything from you. And get out of here. It's ready. What an asshole. It's you! How did you get in here? Through the back door, 1 wanted to see my son. His nails have a lighter colour, that's a good sign. - Didn't you speak to the professor? -No. 1 didn't tell you this, but you're not allowed here at this hour... If the professor found out he'd be upset with me. Sure, I understand. I need to speak to Oriana. Oriana, it's the chief. Yes? Okay, I'll be right there. Yes, I suppose it would be like a scandal column. But there's one thing I don't get, why come to me? - Because I know you. - 1 wouldn't say that. And I'm not dumb enough to let someone use the paper to blackmail people. Me? Blackmail? Thanks to my father's foresight, and his early death... I have enough to live comfortably. No. You see... - 1 used to be a brilliant diplomat. - Before you were kicked out. Precisely! I'm looking to relaunch my social life. You think you can do that slinging mud at your neighbours? Journalism is a ruthless job. 1 don't need to tell you that. You're quite right, you don't need to tell me anything... - I'm quite sure of that. - Very well... I'll find one of your less scrupulous colleagues... And another newspaper will increase its readership. And I'll bite my hands. - Fabrizio, what are you doing here? -1 came to offer my services... But it was a waste of time... There's no room for mine if they're publishing your articles. Of course. We're not on the same path. You continue on yours, and don't abandon your morality. What's up with you today? You look miraculously different! - ln some way I am. - Yes? What's it about? 1 can't now, the boss called me and he seemed a little nervous. Don't worry, he's upset because of me. -1 have some great news for you. -Yes? You've been wanting an assignment in Cambodia for some time... Well now you've got it! So pack your suitcases and go. Even tomorrow if you like? No, I'm sorry, It's true I really wanted to go... -But I can't leave now. - Why? Because... It isn't so hard to explain... 1 found out I was pregnant yesterday aftemoon. It's something I've always dreamed of... And now, I don't know, but I feel different, I feel like a different woman. Another woman? You're not going to give birth tomorrow! You understand me, Giorgio... For the first time, I see my life just as you do... My mind has always been on my work... But now I realise there are other more important things in life. You understand, don't you? Yes. Listen, this is all very good to hear... But someone has to go to Cambodia and write the article. - You go, Giorgi “es Hor Why not? Twenty days, fabulous weather, and it will take your mind off things... - I'm sure it will do you a lot of good. - No, I'm sorry but that won't be possible... -1 can't leave my son. - You can't do anything for him now... The doctors are taking care of him. Please don't insist. 1 don't want to leave him, not now. Well, I'm going. - So, what is this miracle? - I'm pregnant. Magnificent! And who's the father? The man I'm going to marry in fifteen days. I hope the little child brings lots of joy to mum and dad. As long as he doesn't look like you! You're wrong, I also brought my parents a lot of joy... - Nine months before I was born. -1 can believe that! Hi, it's Oriana. Listen, it's been a few days since that foreign woman was murdered... You think so? Listen, do me a favour, can you get someone else to write it? I tried but I don't feel up to it. Perhaps that's why? I never thought about it. Thanks! I'll see you tomorrow. - Good evening. - Colonel. - 1 heard you coming back so I... - It's okay, go on. You must excuse me, 1 don't mean to insist... But I'm going out of my mind. Did you manage to do something? Yes, don't worry, I spoke to a friend... - And she'll bring some next week. - Great, thank you very much... If only you knew, my stamps are all I have to keep me company. Okay, Goodnight. Goodnight... Again. Identical to the other one... Right down to the last detail. Although this might help us with the investigation. Let's hope so. The only thing we've discovered is that sign is the symbol of fertility... It belongs to an Oriental religion. I've questioned a few sex maniacs but it hasn't got us anywhere. Tell me, don't you think it might all be a set up... By someone trying to pass themselves off as insane? And they're actually sane! - What is it? - There are some phone numbers here? Let's see... - Palumbo. - Sir? - Make some calls. - Okay. - Where's the telephone? - This is the telephone, it's modem. - 1 thought it was an electric shaver. - Palumbo, a woman lived here. Hello? Pisani household. Yes, Giorgio Pisani, the writer. He isn't here. 1 don't know, he didn't come back last night. She's mistaken, I got home after midnight, she was asleep when I arrived. And was she still asleep when you left the house this moming? - What time was it? - It must have been around seven. When we called you, around eleven, the housekeeper seemed embarrassed... - What was wrong with her? - How should I know? She told me your bed hadn't been slept in. -1 made it before I went out. - Did you write this dedication? Yes, I wrote it, but... - But, what? - It's a fairly routine dedication. Earlier you told me you didn't know Tiffany... Yet this book was in her home, where you claim you've never been... Do you still insist you've never met her? Books often end up on market stalls and purchased again. This looks like it came from a library, it's hardly been read. Very well, Pisani, you can go. By the way... According to the report, the crime was committed at around eight... Did you happen to meet anyone on your way to work, between seven and nine? - Do you think that's possible driving? - You must have refuelled. No. Good day. Palumbo... Come here. Give it to forensics. -1 want the handkerchief back. - Yes, sir. Actually, Sofia... - You're leaving? - 1 think so. Why don't you stay tonight? - You know why. - Right, your wife! - She might find out you have a lover. - No, that's not true... My wife? She doesn't care about that... My wife is quite understanding. It's all about appearances. She's so bourgeois, she'll never change. What's more... Don't do this to me, Sofia. - What's more, she's a proud catholic. - And I'm just an idiot, am I? She might not mind, but I don't like being made a fool of. You think you can do whatever you like, acting the duke in the clinic. What are you talking about? At this hour? Just so you know, I'm a left wing democrat. Why? Are you scared you'll be late? But you weren't scared the other night... And you weren't with me, or at home! And yesterday moming, at nine, when I spoke to your wife, you still hadn't retuned... And you didn't receive any urgent calls last night! As for your bourgeois wife, as you call her... Do you know what she said? My dear, you've stolen my husband, but another whore will steal him from you. Very pleasant. You see? That's what she's like. What do you have to say for yourself? It's always the same... My shirt, Sofia. You're becoming just like my wife... So instead of one I can't deal with, 1 end up with two. I bet you'd like to have a baby as well. Be honest, your maternal instincts will arrive sooner or later... Mother nature created you to be one thing only... Mothers! - Aldo... -Yes? I'm not sure how much this will interest you, perhaps you don't care... But I'm already pregnant. Good evening. 1 hope 1 didn't keep you waiting? - No, I've just arrived. - 1 had engine trouble. - Then take it to a mechanic. - Okay, sure. You look tired, 1 hope he isn't too demanding. You're kidding! He's terrible in bed. Admit it, you like him! It's only natural, he's handsome, elegant... - Well, there are moments. -You see? I'm not jealous, you know, in fact I'd be upset if it was a sacrifice for you. He doesn't mean anything to me. I love you. You think I don't love you? Why else would I make all these sacrifices... So we can open a beauty clinic and all retire young. By the way, instead of getting him to spend money on furniture and presents... Try to get some cash, otherwise we'll never open it. Don't worry, I have some news for you about the professor... - Something that will fix everything. - Such as? We'll discuss it later. The same fingerprints we found on the book, as well as the victim... And also on one of the glasses. One more on the paper cutter, and we'd have him! - But he cleaned it. - Great, now yours are on it. No, let's not hurry this, I'm not accusing anyone unless I'm sure. But he was there, in that damned attic... And he knew Tiffany. Why would he lie? He had already asked me if I knew her, before showing me the book... And I said no. The police could make my life very difficult... To find myself in trouble over such nonsense. Well they haven't called you back. They probably have more interesting leads to follow up... You'll see. Perhaps, but aunt Martha really landed me in it, saying I hadn't returned that night. Come on! You have no reason to worry, it takes more than that to accuse someone of murder... You also need a motive, and what reason would you have to kill Oriana? - None. - Well, then. What did Fabrizio want at the newspaper? He was trying to sell one of his stupid ideas to the editor. Nothing... Another one of those many scandal columns. Seeing as how he confides in you... What for? 1 didn't start it. It's all very amusing to you, but I'm the one in trouble here. Hello? Professor, it's Sofia. You speak to her. It's pointless, she won't stop calling until she speaks to you Okay, thank you very much! Yes, it's me. Do I have to come now? Okay, I'll pass by the clinic then I'll come to you. I can't believe it. These things happen to the best families... Yet 1 had to end up with someone who's excited at the idea of being a mother... And she wants to shout it from the rooftops. She could make life very difficult. It goes there, you almost had it... If I were in your shoes I'd do three things... First, I'd find out if she really is pregnant. I've already thought of that... I've asked doctor Franzi, our gynaecologist, Sofia works with her. Get my light brown jacket. You said three things, what's the second? Get some new clothes. You look ridiculous! Ridiculous? 1 don't see why? - My grandfather wore it. - Precisely. Was that a hint? - And the third? - Be careful, Aldo... I've given up everything, even having children... - But I'm not prepared to lose my dignity. - Explain yourself. darling? If she causes a scandal and it's in all the papers, I won't be on your side. Bitch. - Good moming, commissioner. - Commissioner? He said you were friends. Perhaps not quite friends but we're not enemies, either... So much so that I'll accept your tea. - If there's some wine? -Yes. - To what do I owe the pleasure? - To this splendid day. If you want the confession of a police commissioner, my dear Pisani... Well you're our alibi today. Yes, with the excuse that we had to see you, we took a little vacation... Lucky you, living out here. Quite a place you've got here. And such beautiful company, if you don't mind? Of course I don't, it's hardly an offence. - Ms. Albagali, a guest. - Never lie to the police, Giorgio! She looks after my son. I'm young and broke, I'm not ashamed to admit it. - I must work if I want to graduate. - Which faculty? - You're a smart policeman, guess? - Medicine. Architecture. It doesn't have much to do with children, but I raised four brothers... So I've leant the ropes. Besides, they treat me like a queen here... Just think, my room here is ten times bigger than the one I used to have at home. - Where is your aunt's room? - Cigarette? Aunt Martha's room is on the other side of the house. - Above the garage? - No... The garage is down there. Well, goodbye... Palumbo. Excuse me! Hello? It doesn't work sometimes. Come here, you can use this one. - If you tell me the number. -32,32... - Twice? - Yes, twice... 32,32,41 It's ringing. Has the professor retumed? You know exactly who it is! Pass me the lady of the house. Hello? Who is it? Why won't you stop, dear? He didn't come? 1 don't know, try the clinic. Do what you like! Jump off a cliff! Hello, Aldo? Aldo! This is no set up... This lunatic is going around Killing anyone who's pregnant. Pregnant? This one wasn't. - She wasn't pregnant? -No. The same technique, like the others... It's a variation on the theme. Good luck, commissioner. ‘Young Nurse Murdered' - Yes, of course... I recognised her straight away... Yes, and my colleagues. Yes, we're certain. She was here yesterday. Pardon? I have to come to the station? And my colleagues? Okay, I'll come now. All the great luminaries have sat on that sofa... That's Pellegrini... That's Introzzi, a great clinician... And that one with the beard is Forlanini... - From the airport. - Indeed... But he wasn't a pilot, he was a clinician. - Let's get back to the woman. - Yes, she worked here... A fine woman. 1 don't think I saw her yesterday... - Yes, perhaps in the moming. - But she called you in the aftemoon... - The bar cashier told us. - Cashier? How does she know? She remembered your number, it's quite easy: 32, 32, 41. Perhaps she called to explain why she had taken the day off... At least, that's what doctor Franzi told me. - Is it normal to call you at home? -1 wasn't in the clinic so she tried there... - It makes sense. - And you weren't here, or at home. - Obviously. - Where were you? 1 went on a visit outside the city, between six and six thirty. And after? I'm sorry, commissioner, are you accusing me? -Do I need to provide an alibi? - No, I'm just curious. Curiosity is part of your professional bias... Just like reservation and secrecy are part of ours. - Any other questions? - No, professor, thank you. Doctor Franzi... Thank you. Pellegrini. 1 didn't recognise you. You know how it is, here in a clinic... - 1 wouldn't have thought you... - 1 know the feeling... 1 arrest you in Rome for being a pimp, and now you're working here as a porter... You've got a lot of explaining to do. That was before, in Rome. Always fighting with the competition, or the police... - So I decided to make a fresh start. - And now you're a pimp, here in Pavia. What are you talking about? I've a got job now. - You? -Yes, me! 1 try to save what I can. - What does the director say? - The professor? He's a great guy, believe me. Like a father. Is he aware of your previous convictions' - Actually... - And you? - Do you know him well? - Sure I do, I'm his driver. - Let's have a little chat. - What is it? 1 don't know anything. The fact that he was having an affair with Sofia doesn't matter... Just answer my question. The professor asked me to visit her yesterday moming... And I was planning on doing it in the afternoon. Why not straight away? The professor didn't want her to know he was behind it... So I really didn't know what to do. Sofia wasn't stupid, quite the opposite. 1 understand. So, you didn't visit her... And the professor had no idea her pregnancy was just a lie. But he had his suspicions. We're sorry to disturb you. Everyone knew Sofia was my lover. But only you and I knew she was pregnant, doctor. And your wife, professor. Yes, it's true... My wife. She also knew. 1 know, a wife talking about her husband as though she married him yesterday. - No, actually... - It's enviable... If you knew how much it upsets my friends. If you listen to my wife... You'll end up convinced it's an injustice I haven't been awarded the Nobel Prize... I'm not sure if it's for my work or as her husband but that's just a small detail. - I'm glad to see you. - I'd like to speak to you. - Of course, do you mind? - No, go ahead. Have a seat. - Tell me, commissioner. - 1 see Sofia's death hasn't troubled you. Why? What should I do? Not in front of my wife, if you don't mind. However, let me clarify something... Sofia and I weren't madly in love... It was just a bit of fun.. A distraction. - But you had the key to her apartment? - What apartment? You know perfectly well, professor... The apartment where you used to meet Sofia. No, I never had the key. Okay, thanks. Excuse us. Leaving already? She's quite an actress. - The button. - Which button? This button! You're in trouble, aren't you? He didn't have the key, poor thing! Elena, what do you know about that key? What is there to know? 1 don't have it any more. 1 can't find it. 1 did have the key... But I got rid of it as soon as I heard what happened. It's one of those things you do instinctively. - Is this key so important? - Yes, it's very important... You see, Sofia was completely naked when she was murdered... She was going to have a bath. If she was going to open the door she would've put something on. 1 almost forgot, there was no sign of a break-in. It's the second time I'm asking you: Am I a suspect? -Do I have to provide an alibi? - Yes, this time 1 wouldn't mind... If you could provide one. Sofia called me that aftemoon, she insisted we meet... So I agreed to meet her at seven in that bar... Michelangelo, my compliments. But first I had to see a friend's son... Who lives outside the city. 1 was there until seven. - And then? - Then I got in my car to retum... But the car broke down on the way... You see, I so drive a lot but 1 don't know anything about cars. So I called a porter at the clinic, a kid who sometimes acts as my driver... The time it took to fix the car, etcetera, etcetera... It took more than an hour. 1 was too late for the appointment... And he drove me back to the city around eight thirty... He can confirm everything, he's a good Kid, his name is... - Franco Pellegrini. - Exactly, do you know him? He's an ex-con with ties to prostitution rackets and more... You weren't expecting that, were you? Think what might have happened to you if you hadn't told us the truth... But you have no reason to worry, right, professor? No, actually I'm very worried! Now you've told me this, that the police... The press are hungry, the city is terrorised... An ex-con make use of this situation... Accusing someone who's innocent to save someone else. - It does happen. - Very true... My superiors are breathing down my neck from noon till dusk... And someone like Pellegrini is capable of anything... But the man I arrest will be the real culprit, not the first one who happens to come along... You can count on that. Very well, I'm counting on it. Good day. Did you know the professor's wife was locked up in an asylum? Attempted murder: She was fifteen years old... She tried to kill her entire family, can you believe that? Luckily she used rat poison... So no one died. They kept her locked up for quite a while... Quite a few years. She's my type of woman. You don't think so? You're right. You have more right to console yourself... My wife is still alive, even if she is a cold as ice! Can I see him? Who does he look like? Not you... Or Erica. He doesn't look like anyone. 1 can start again, but it's the fifth time... Then it gets monotonous, like a stuck record. 1 was at work, when the professor called me... It must have been seven, seven ten... He said; "Pellegrini, my car has broken down.” Okay, I get it. Go on. If you don't mind? Okay, as you know... Me and Sofia were close... Do you think I'd provide an alibi for someone who murdered my woman? - He was also paying you. - Paying me? He helped me out, some small loans... Truth is, I loved her. She was Kind, beautiful. And she did everything you asked her to do... Like telling the professor she was pregnant, to squeeze him some more. No, that was her idea. 1 wouldn't have thought of that... Besides, Sofia couldn't have children. - Are you sure of that? - Of course... I never used any protection when we made love... She had... She told me when we met... She had something hereditary, something inside her... 1 don't remember the exact word, they told me at the clinic. - Why didn't you tell the police? - Tell the police? No, it's just a theory, nothing more... - 1 might send them down the wrong path. - Okay, let's discuss it... -1 can be with you in an hour. - Here, at the clinic? - No, I feel like I'm being watched here. - Okay... Okay, then I'll go to your place. It's also closer. No, it's no trouble at all. - Won't you finish eating? - No... Lydia isn't one to get frightened over nothing. Frightened of what? Lydia! - Giorgio. - Lydia. The light switch is by the door. What happened? 1 just got home, and I was getting changed... You're injured! I'm so scared, I want to scream! Then scream! Just calm down and relax. He jumped out of there. He jumped out of there. At first it was just a theory, but now I'm certain... Sofia worked with me, we saw the same things... I'm certain she was killed because she had noticed something... Something I could have noticed as well. - At the clinic, you mean? -Yes. I'm no expert with a bandage, but aunt Martha will fix you up. - Martha? - Yes, you're coming with me. You can't stay here, he might come back. 1 can't, you live too far away from the clinic. You're not going back there. To hell with it all and start thinking of yourself. Don't worry, we'll call Fabrizio tomorrow. Where? You know how many days it's been since I last saw him? I've lost count. I'm starting to forget we're married. - Do you want to see the boy? -Yes. Who is she? The new nanny? - He's a lot better today. - Yes, much better. - He's eating. - 1 told you it was nothing. - Will you take me to Santangelo? - Of course. 1 was thinking of going in the aftemoon, there's a patient I need to see. As you wish. I'll go to the clinic, what danger can there be at Santangelo? Besides, I'll be there as well. You're forgetting aunt Martha is going away for a few days... - You have to look after the boy. - Another time, then... She'll have to do without a bodyguard. Don't forget you're only relaxed now because you feel safe here. How could I? when you've stared death in the face... You never forget it. - About that night... -Yes? 1 don't know... There's something strange, something I'm missing. What? If I knew... - Has Lydia already gone? - Yes, a while ago. Listen, I know it's going to be boring for you tonight. It won't be much fun for me, either. Dinner with a publisher. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - I'll tell you another time. Now go, you'll be late. I'm pregnant. Come on, don't be like that... If you don't mind, it's worse for me than it is for you. What do I have to do with it? What do you mean? Am I mistaken, or have we been sleeping together for a while now? - Yes, but... - But it might not be yours, right? Is that what you wanted to say? - Actually, I... -1getit. Even though I haven't left this house since I arrived... You're so selfish, and so scared to compromise... That you'd rather label me a whore. - 1 didn't say that... - Look, this isn't what you think... I'm twenty years old, I have no intention of settling down... 1 want to live my life. 1 only told you so you can find a doctor to get me out of this mess. Let me get this straight... You're saying I'm the father? You've finally realised. Listen, I'm not going to the dinner, I'll tell them I can't come. No, you're going. It's important. Besides, I'd like to be alone for a while... - Is Giorgio here? -No. Pisani, you're not upset I spoke badly of your hook? Pardon? No, I'm calling home. -No answer? -No. It's very strange. Look, I'm not dangerous. Giorgio and I are good friends... I'm Erica's brother. A bastard brother, but Erica and I always got along. Speaking of which, do you know anything about an envelope Erica had for me? Yes, Giorgio mentioned an envelope, but it was quite a while ago. Fabrizio told me about it a long time ago... I didn't believe him, I thought he wanted to make me argue with Giorgio... He likes to stir up trouble. Do you know him? - A little. - Completely different to Erica... Creepy... He doesn't know what he wants. He isn't much of a man if you ask me. - Yes, but the envelope? - Giorgio told me to come and get it. It's probably money. Erica knew I always needed it. - Can see the boy? - He's sleeping now. Another time then. 1 don't want to cause any trouble. It's late. I have to go. They've probably already replaced me... 1 wouldn't be surprised. I'm sorry about the boy, but if he wakes up... Not at all. I'll come again soon. Call tomorrow, I'll ask Giorgio about the envelope. That would be great. He jumped out of there. - I'm pregnant. - He doesn't look like anyone. The massacre of the innocents. I'm sorry but I have to leave, it's something important. What's wrong with him? It's strange, he's never done that before. -Who is it? - It's me, I forgot something. It's for the baby... - You shouldn't have. - A gift from his uncle. Thank you. Sofia wasn't stupid, quite the opposite. Thank you very much. Giorgio, is that you? Who's there? Be careful, he's got an axe! Lydia... You! - You killed Erica. -Yes. Why did you do it? Because I love you Giorgio. I've always loved you. 1 killed the others, too. And no one caught me because 1 thought of everything, with this! With my brain! And that baby, it's mine! - Yes, Lydia. - No, it isn't mine! Because I'm sterile, not you, Giorgio. 1 can't have children... So I have to kill everyone who can. And now I have to kill Alba as well, because she's pregnant. 1 did the test myself. Lydia. Thank god you got here before me, 1 was afraid I wouldn't make it in time. Call an ambulance. Then call this number... Tell him we caught the murderer; Lydia Franzi, and that we need him. Those vases had remained miraculously intact on her window ledge... And I realised Lydia had staged the attack... So I got scared, and came racing home. My journey took a little longer, but it helped me uncover another murder... 1 know... My wife. 1 found out Lydia Franzi couldn't have children... And I heard a little whisper that she was in love with you... What's more, your wife died giving birth, while Franzi was with her... And no one else. I had my suspicions so I secretly requested an autopsy on your wife. 1 was hoping that her killer had also left the symbol of fertility on her in some way... And I was right: Hastily inscribed on her pubis... You wanted to see me? - Yes, professor. -1 saw the ambulance... Frankly, I wouldn't know what to do for doctor Franzi... It isn't my field. Good evening. That isn't why I disturbed you. Please, have a seat. 1 don't think there's anything anyone can do for Franzi. I'd like you to help me bring this series of horrendous crimes to a close... I'm talking about the murder of someone you knew very well... - Sofia. - Sofia? 1 don't understand... She was killed in the same horrendous manner as the others. Indeed. But not by Lydia Franzi. Lydia knew Sofia couldn't have children, Pellegrini had told her... Sofia's partner. Something doesn't add up... Lydia Franzi had no reason to kill Sofia... So there's another killer. Someone who, believing Sofia was pregnant... Murdered her knowing it would blamed on the other maniac. Do you have any idea who that might be? Sofia had two men in her life: you and Pellegrini... Pellegrini knew the pregnancy was a lie... And he had no interest in killing the very woman who was keeping him. So I would rule him out, even if he doesn't have an alibi. - Pellegrini doesn't have an alibi? - Yes, that's right... You both shared the same alibi... The story about your car breaking down and Pellegrini coming to get you... - That story doesn't hold up. -lgetit... You got Pellegrini to say what you suited you... - You don't think this... - No, Pellegrini held out... It's just that we found out your car was with a mechanic that aftemoon... - So someone wasn't telling the truth. - What are you getting at? Nothing, I'd just like to show you something... Do these gloves belong to you? - No. - That's strange because your wife disagrees... Bring her in. He was so sure of himself, that he left them there, in the garage... Without hiding them, like nothing had happened. You filthy whore. ‘Professor Betti Murdered Young Nurse' Do NOT trade or sell my subs. Fuck the hoarding cunts. Italian Audio Composite Created by LqGb.
