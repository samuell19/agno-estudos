(alarm rings) (camera takes pictures) * Ooh * Shh * * Hey, kid, rock and roll * Rock on * Ooh, my soul FELIX: In Hollywood in 1972, up on sunset, man... the strip was packed every night. * Jump up and down * In your blue suede shoes FELIX: And not with tours, but us... the people in the back rooms trying to make it. * Where do we go from here? * * Which is a way that's clear? * * Still lookin' for * That blue jean baby queen * * prettiest girl... FELIX: We were all out there looking for something, because we knew that L.A. was a gold mine, and your life could change in 24 hours. And that's why we came here. Oh, that's right. Just walk on by. Oh, shit. Michael, you know I hate eating alone. I'm sorry. Come join us. You want some more coffee? No. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Okay, but do you want more coffee? * Rock on here it is. * Rock on MICHAEL: I'm sorry about today. Things just got a little out of hand. Yeah? So, who was she? (laughs) You really want to know who she was? Or you want to know what she was doing to him? So, the shoot's still at 2:00? Yeah. I'll pick you up. Uh-huh. Did you ever think about washing some of this? No. Well, you should. Hey, I like the new song. Remember what you said if it goes to number one... Yes, but only if you learn to play the guitar. * Human nature * What? * Always seems to * Have a way of givin' in I'll be right back. Miss, miss. Could you change the radio station, please? I like this song. -I wrote this song. -You wrote this song? Yeah, and I really don't want to hear it right now, you know what I'm saying? Mary, I got the guy over here who did this song. Ohh. Hi. Hi. Is this you singing? (sighs) Look, if it was me singing, do you think that I would be here eating toast and eggs? I'd be at the Hyatt, right? With a 16-year-old girl with perky little breasts who thinks I understand her, you know? But it's not me singing, no. You know why? Because I'm not that guy. So would you mind too much changing the goddamn fucking radio station, please? Ohh. Oh. Oh, man. Oh, fuck. (sighs) Bobby. Out. Come on. Oh, baby. Get out. Ohh. Bobby, come on. Hey, baby. Oh, come on, come on, don't be that way. Give your daddy some sugar. Come on. Bobby. I need to get some sleep. Ohh. You know, it wasn't that long ago you were begging me every time I come off stage. Yeah, and how many stages you been on lately, Bobby? (sighs) You should eat more. You're too skinny. You should eat eggs. I don't eat eggs, Mr. Niederhaus. We talked about this. Everybody eats eggs. I don't eat meat or their baby embryos. Do you eat fish? Yeah. I eat--I eat fish. Yeah. You should come tonight to the show. Maybe you could come on stage and play the tambourine. Hey, come here. Hey. Nice dog. Thanks. Come on. Well, what do you call yourself? Naked Snake. Naked Snake? Now, that's a name. I just wanted it to be "Naked" first, but then one of our guys killed his snake in his garage during rehearsal, so it was some kind of sign. Listen, I need to rest, okay? You need this? Let me have some of that. This could be it, Mr. Niederhaus. Tonight, I may actually be able to get some of that money that I owe you. You know? I mean, it goes well, because there's going to be some major labels there. You know? If they like us... you buy some fish before you pay me, okay? Okay. Don't forget that. No, no. How many girls have you been with lately? Come on, Doc. I know where I got it. I just need the shot. Yeah. Okay. You know what they call a guitarist without a lady friend? No. You got me. -Homeless. -Aah! Ha ha ha! It wouldn't have hurt if you laughed. You done? Done, done, done. (sniffs) oh, nice. You're going to have to let her know-- and anybody else you've been with. Don't worry. She'll know. Okay, who's next? FELIX: Roses are red, violets are blue. Jennifer the cocktail waitress has the clap, and she gave it to you. That's touching. I like that. Is that a new lyric? Yeah. (sighs) (sighs) you know, Mikey, I'd take a couple of shots in the ass for Jennifer. You want me to pass that on for you? Nah. That's not necessary. You want me to go in there with you for a little support, you know? It's kind of hard to tell somebody that they're diseased. And I also want to assure you... and her... that I'm not going to say anything. Thanks, man. You got it. All right, so what do you got on today? I got a lot of exclusive interview type stuff and, uh, you know. -Don't work too hard. -Yeah. Hey, Mike. What are you doing here? Jen's letting me crash. (music playing) You want a beer? * Aw, yeah * * Uhh * Aw, yeah What time is it, man? It's a little after 10:00. Oh, you wait there. Don't you fucking move, all right? You're going to love this idea for the shoot, man. So where is she? Check this shit out, man. It's just like I was telling you, right fucking here. Glenn, this is Kennedy just before he had his head blown off. Exactly, man. That's what's so great about it. Just imagine the irony, Mike. Okay? Add me sitting up on a back seat playing my guitar, and... I'm in color. Right. When's she going to be back? No, no, no. You listen to me, Mike. Check this out. The rest of the band... we make them secret service agents. That's great, man. Bring it with you to the shoot. Yeah? All right. Hey, did you want to talk to Jen? No. Just tell her she's got the clap. (door closes) Okay, take an inch off Darryl's inseam and an eighth off the seat. No, Tammy, man, take off, like, 5 inches, man. I want these pants painted on, man. I want little chickens in the back row to know who docks to the left and who to the right. You know what I mean? Meat and potatoes, man. Relax, Marty. I know what you want, okay? (telephone rings) Ahem. Boys, this here's the lady that's going to make you forget all about your days... at Chester's Chicken Shack. Damn near everybody Tammy lays her hands on becomes a star. Ain't that right, baby? Tammy, Duncan Reed is on the phone. Is it him or his manager? It's his manager. Um... well, take a message. Yeah. Take a message, man. That guy's a prick. Malcolm, what do you think? Looks good. Real bad ass, man. What do you think, baby? It ain't working, Marty. What are you talking about, man? It's exactly what I wanted. You've done a beautiful, beautiful thing today. Why don't you let the lady speak, please? How long you been in the business, my man? Like, 10 minutes? Okay? I've been in the business 10 years. I think I know a thing or two about pants. Man, we are not The Temptations. You got it all wrong, man. Let me tell you a little something about The Temptations, man. Even The Temptations ain't dressing like The Temptations no more. You know why? Do you know why? Because Marty told them it was time for a change. That's right. R&B-- R&B is all about knowing your "r"s from your "b"s. No one knows that shit better than me, man. Because I keep my ears close to the street, man. I'm in touch with the ghetto. That's right. Always have been, man. Fuck. Shit, nigger, I am the streets. Get off it. You grew up in the valley. (laughter) Okay, that's the north valley, man. Shit, man. They got to like what they're wearing. No. I got to like what they're wearing. Brother, you got to trust the lady. All right, you tell me how it is. Yeah, man, let me tell you something. Marty, you got to trust her, man. What's this? * You've got to trust somebody * * Yeah * You've got to trust somebody * Okay, don't get me started, man. You know Marty can't control himself. (sighs) * Yeah, yeah, yeah * * You've got to trust somebody * * Oh oh oh oh oh * * Who's your baby? * Who's your friend? * * When it's cold outside * I'll let you in * Liars lie * Yes, they do * Like a new pair of shoes * I'll walk with you * It's kinda hard to believe * * In anybody but you * But you can't do it all by yourself * * You've got to trust somebody * * Oh * * You've got to trust somebody * * You've got to * You've got to trust somebody * (telephone rings) (rings) EILEEN: Excuse me, Tammy? Marty Shapiro doing his job, man. New threads, a new tune-- that's why I do the managing. Tammy, it's Duncan Reed. Huh? Duncan Reed is on the phone. MAN: That's us? Um, okay. I'll take it upstairs. MARTY: Trust me, too, man. Right on. -Watch out, man. -No shit. All right, man, let's celebrate. What do you want to do? This is Tammy. DUNCAN (Scottish accent): I hate to pull you away from whatever you're doing. Hey, Duncan. I want to see you. Oh, yeah? How about the Hyatt? Why don't you come along and bring some of your stuff? Um... well, we're--we're kind of crazy here. Um... (sighs) I'll tell you what. Give me an hour, okay? See you. Yeah. Bye. (electric guitar playing) (guitar riff plays) (duplicates guitar riff) (guitar riff plays) (duplicates guitar riff) (improvises) (plays first guitar riff) Who are you? * I wanna make you mine * So I'm gonna make you mine * * I believe in you (British accent) Yes. Can I help you? Um, I'm Tammy... Franklin? Duncan's expecting me. One moment, please. Right this way, Miss Franklin. Thank you. I'm Nigel Richardson, the band's manager. Would you like some tea? Um, yeah, sure. It's there on the trolley. Duncan will be with you shortly. He says you're very talented. Thank you. Barry, this spot for you-- I'm not talking about it anymore. The party is before the show, and that's it. It's done. Barry, it's absurd. A party at, what, 7:00? The sun will still be up. You want the people from the press to be at this show early and on time and in a good mood, correct? Okay. We're going to feed them. We're going to booze them. Excuse me. Excuse me. I would love a cup of tea, please, with just a little bit of sugar. And then reviews will be great. They'll be-- it's just... trust me. This is how we do it out here. Not to mention Jann Wenner already loves Duncan anyway. So it's, like-- it's not a big stretch, and the band doesn't care. And then you can have a big party afterwards for all of us with the tit and the 'ludes and whatever, okay? Thanks. And not your 'ludes-- his 'ludes. (laughter) (door opens) Hi, Tammy. You're not leaving, are you? Hello, Duncan. Good to see you. Bedroom? Uh-huh. Oh, you've been busy. Yeah. Things have been, you know, good. Yeah. Thank you. Now, I only did these the other day. I'd love to see you in this one, but if that scares you... we could always do something like this. What do you think? Do you want a drink? Sure. Why not? The chap from Rolling Stone is here. I'm having a conversation here. (door closes) So, how long you in L.A.? Do you know what? You look absolutely beautiful. Do you know that? Thank you. I think... keep these ready for tonight, and I'll swing by and pick you up... and we'll go to the show together. Um... Yeah. Uh-huh. (music playing) Excuse me. I want to trade these in. Cash or credit? Cash. 6 bucks. 6? Man. Or 9, in-store credit. Did you even see what's here? That's the best I can do. Man, this is war-- World is a Ghetto. This is only one of the greatest albums of this century. We've got it. Man, do you even know what this is? Tell me. School's Out. Now, this one, it's hard to let this one go, man. This one has... the panties, man. This--these are a collector's item. They're pristine-- mint. Years from now, man, these are going to be worth bucks, and I'm throwing them in. All this... for another... 2.50? I'll give you 8. What can I say? Yes. Okay. Man, I'm parked in the red. You think I could just-- I'll be right with you, sir. Just a couple of packs of smokes. I'll be right with you. Okay. Shit. You don't mind, do you, man? I don't... I don't think they serve your kind here. What? I want you to know I don't have a problem with your people. Mm-hmm. (laughs) Hey, man, is that supposed to be some kind of racial slur? Because that ain't cool. No. I'm diggin' it, bro. I'm with you. Hey, you know, that-- listen, that-- god damn it, man. You know, that attitude of yours... what, you perceive me as something different from you? Why don't you listen to what my man king had to say? You remember Martin Luther king, man? You know what he's talking about? What? Okay. You can mock me all you fucking want, but he's talking about peace. You got to open your ears, man, and listen for the sounds of brotherhood, you know what I mean? Are you a brother? Can I help you? Let me get a couple of packs of menthols and some nasal spray. Shit, man, give me your hand. Just--truce. Just give me your hand. Please, man. Just--please. (laughs) (breathes deeply) (whistles) You feel that, man? You going to tell me you don't feel that? Hey. That's my aura. You're getting a parking ticket. Aw. Fucker. Get the fuck off my ride, man. When I was 17, I was in this really bad car crash. It took them almost 2 hours just to get me out. See, I don't tell this story to many people, you know, but you seem cool, you know, so... Sure, kid. Yeah. While all this is going on, I'm having this kind of-- this near-death experience. You know, I'm floating over my body. There's this tunnel and this white light, you know? And it's the whole bit. And I'm thinking it's Buddha or Jesus coming to get me, but you know who it is? It's--it's Jimi Hendrix. Wow. Unstraps his strat-- this blinding-white beautiful Stratocaster-- he hands it to me. I take it, and he starts to fade off into this white light, this purple sky. MAN: Can you take this down for me? Hey, yeah. Be right there. All right, well... first thing I do... when I leave the hospital, is I go straight to the nearest music store. And there it is... like it's been waiting for me... this beautiful white Strat. I plug it in and I just start playing. You know, like I've always know how. It wasn't great, but I could feel his energy moving through me, you see? And that's--that's when I knew I could not screw around with my life anymore. That I had to do what Jimi said and I had to come out to L.A. That was almost a year ago. So...do you still want the strings? Yeah, just the strings. I'm sorry. (camera clicks) Hey, you. Hi. Have we got any messages? What was he like? Come on. We gotta move fast. What was who like? Stop that! Come on, Michael, we're late. Okay. Eileen, let's go. -I'm ready. -Lift. All right, lift. Got it. Got it. Who are you fitting? Duncan Reed. Eileen! You have to start this for me. What? Now, cut the pattern, use this velvet, and start the fitting. Tammy, I don't think-- you can do it, okay? It's just like he'd expect me to drop everything. But you did, didn't you? What? Drop everything for him. -I did not. -Sure. I didn't. So, did you look at my colors? Yeah, they're great. Hmm? Did you? What did you think? You like them? Yeah, they're great. You didn't even look, did you? (laughs) I was up all night doing those, Michael. I looked, okay? I think they're great. They'll work. Thank you. Ahem. Do you think they're big enough? How am I supposed to answer a question like that? Do you know what I'm talking about? My breasts. Do you think they're big enough? I'm not your brother. It's-- No, you're not? No. No, seriously. Okay, okay, okay. Are they big enough for what? For me! Just, you know, for men liking breasts. Sure. Yeah? They're great. (laughs) We got that out of the way now? Thank you, yeah. Good. Ever think of getting married? No, I don't think so. No, me, neither. (gun cocks) (gunfire) (clicking) God damn it, man! Come on, Mike! Not a gun works around here, man! Now, who's on these guns? I'm sorry. I got it. Ahh. Whoo. Look, Mike, I'm glad we let go of that whole Kennedy thing, man. Michael! I hate the shirt! I just want to make sure--hey! I just want to make sure we ain't missing out on any opportunity here. Just to really-- unh!--you know? I need 2 minutes, okay? Right. Where's the dirt? Here, try this one. Tammy, we need the dirt. I got the dirt. It's gotta be special, Mike! I want an album cover people are gonna remember, man. They will, man. Trust me. Hey, how about this, man? How about we shoot it with me up on the horse? Huh? Huh? Sure. Charlie, get him a horse. -A horse. -A horse? You like horsies, huh? Let's go with this one. -Uh-huh. -You like that? I bet you do. You look good. Okay. Damn! What's her name, man? Who, Tammy? Yeah. She always so friendly? Only if you play guitar. Hey, uh, Tammy! (sniffs) I think I need a little more dirt! You look great, man. Let's just get the shot. Whoa, whoa, whoa! (guns firing) Come on, boy! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit, Mike, I don't know about this horse, man! Don't you got something to do? Now, quiet, everybody! Shut up! I got it. I got it, man. You know what it needs? You know what this whole thing needs, man? No. No. A woman, man. Right up here on the back. All scared and all, up here with me. Let's try it once more just like this. (sighs) Hey, Tammy. What? You want to be a saloon girl? (laughs) Help me out here, please? Just help me out here. It'll be fun. This guy's out of control. Might be fun. Come on. Come on. Yeah, okay. I'll be your saloon girl. I got the perfect dress, too. GLENN: All right! Hey, Mike? You just worry about keeping it all in focus, okay, Mike? Come on, my man, let's go. Come on! Action, Glenn! Oh, my god, help me! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down! Everybody hold up! Hold up! I got an idea, my man. Could you just shoot the fucking gun, please? What if-- No, no, let's just do this. No, you listen to me, man, all right? I'm telling you what I want, okay? What do you want to do, Glenn? Now, you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. -You ready? -Yeah, I'm ready. Just imagine this, man. This whole place is on fire, man. I mean, burning down to the ground, okay? Tammy and I, we're up here on the horse, coming through all that. Huh? Can't do it. This is Hollywood. We can do whatever we want. (sighs) What do you think, Tammy? (giggles) Can we do it, Mike? Tammy loves it! (cheering) Screw it. Oh, man, come on, Mike. What's the matter, man? Pack the lights up when you're done. Mike. Michael! Hey, baby, just let him go. No! Somebody get me a camera! Do this the right way. Some film and lights, too, man. Shoot it my damn self. Michael. Michael, you can't walk away from this. (starts engine) Oh, well, fucking go. How many carrots do you eat a day? I try to eat 20, but sometimes I don't. I drink carrot juice every day. It was nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you. I'm--I'm here a lot. Hey. Hey. The Doberman. This morning. I was walking with the old man. Did my dog do something to hurt him? No. Nothing like that. So, listen, my band-- I'm in a band. They're playing at the Whiskey tonight. If you want to come down, I could put your name on the list. We don't get out much. "We" as in you and the dog? Who's we? It's--it's a boyfriend, right? Boyfriend. Well, I could put you down for 2. (engine sputtering) If you want to come down, you can. What's your name? (engine sputters) Doesn't sound so good. You should have your boyfriend take a look at that. You know, I could-- I could look at it. If you want. You want me to help you with these bags? I--I only have a couple of dollars. No, I'm-- (gunshot) what was that? Nothing. He's just shooting birds. (gunshots) Just be cool, okay? Hey, babe. Where have you been? I went to get groceries. This is Zack. The car died again and he gave me a ride. Hey, man. Wow. Zack's band is playing the Whiskey tonight. ZACK: Yeah, we are. If you want to come down, I can put your name on the list. You have been gone 2 hours. You bangin' her? No, man. You know what? I am so sick of this. I want to talk to you. Now. Hey, I can go if--if you want to talk to him. No, it's okay. I'll be right back. Okay. BOBBY: Where the hell do you think you're going?! Christine, you get your butt back here right now, god damn it! You'd better go. Yeah, okay. What time did you meet her at the store, kid? Baby, why are you doing this? 'Cause she gave me a time and I want to see if your time and her time are the same time. Man, can I just say one thing? What? Man, Monday, Monday, California dreamin'... I just want to thank you, man. Zack, he's not John Phillips. Fuck you! Get the fuck out of my house! Fucker! (engine roars) Christine! Enter. This is my house. Hey, Eileen? Meet Glenn.

Sherman, The Bee Gees. These are the talents the world's gonna know, man. Not some cynical bastard who knew the score and still stupid enough to pull shit like this. Man, who do you think you are? (groans) (laughs) Oh, missed you, baby. Come on. Here, come on, out. No. Out. I've got a customer. You have to go. No, no. Please, baby, please. Put your shirt on. Listen, listen.

Otherwise, it's not a martini. We talked about this. Huh? (sighs) Am I gonna have to teach you again? No. I just want you to know I'm thankful for this. 'Cause I've had a great day, and you just raised it to another level. I knew I could count on you. I really appreciate it. Thank you. You're welcome. (click) Gimme one of your faces, man. Mikey, that's-- that's cold. (click) (click) That's very handsome. Uh-huh. (click) (click) I need a drink. Well... (sighs) I think you're all out. You okay, baby? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I've just got a difficult client. I thought you'd, uh, left. Glenn, do you know Duncan? Duncan, this is Glenn. Duncan's band's playing at the Whiskey tonight. I've heard your stuff. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. It's not, uh... it's not honky-tonk. It's... it's on its own. I guess if you say so, my man. No, really. I love it. It's... it's real American music. You've got good taste, my man. Now, let me tell you something about yourself. You fellas, you're stealin' the blues right out from under us, man. I mean, come on. Thank you, brother. Listen, I want you to come to the gig tonight, sit in with the guys. Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't do that, man. Of course you can. Okay. Ha ha! Good man. -All right. -Yeah. Hey, uh, you like bikes? I love bikes. Check this out, man. You're not gonna believe this right here. Mm-hmm. I'll see you tonight. (door bell rings) (dog barking in distance) (plays riff) (guitar repeats riff in distance) (repeats riff) (botches riff) (guitar playing) (guitar playing) Turn that thing down. You've got a visitor. Hi. Hi. Want me to make you tea for your guest? I'll make you tea. Someone's got a view. Yeah. You know that he played clarinet in the studio orchestra for Gone With the Wind? MGM. He was there for 20 years. Look, I just wanted to apologize. How did you find me up here? Well, I wouldn't call your car an eyesore, but it wasn't exactly difficult to spot. Oh, so you-- you looked for it? Yeah. Yeah. Well... I hope it goes well for you tonight, Zack. I'll put your name on the list. (knock on door) Michael, it's Tammy. Can I come in? Yeah, come in. Hi. What are you doing? Working. Are these new? You haven't seen those? No. You can't just do that, Michael. What? The shoot. It was important to me, and you just pissed it away. You know, you're not the only one who cares about their work. Your work? Yeah, my work. Come on, Michael, we both know the way this works. No, we both know the way you work. Yeah, whatever it takes, that's what I do. Look, this is not really a good time. You should probably leave. Why don't you ever use color? 'Cause I like black and white. But some shoots you should work in color. Like today's and some shoots like today-- Black and white works for me, so, uh... I use it. And to be honest, I have a little trouble with colors. What do you mean? I'm colorblind. That's why I was never drafted. Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny. I think that's very funny. Michael the photographer is colorblind. It's just blues, reds, and greens. I get them mixed up, that's all. Yeah, well, it explains a lot. What? What you're wearing. That shirt and these pants. It drives me crazy. What, it doesn't work? No. But it's okay. I'll dress you. I'll dress myself, thanks very much. Okay. (giggles) A colorblind photographer. Just don't tell anyone. Hey. That's good. That's... that's really good. Thank you. I, uh, I got to go. I've left Eileen alone at the shop. See ya. Ahem. Bye. (drums playing) Make sure we got enough ice back there, too, huh? And remove the weed. Thanks. Aw, man, hey. Aw, hey, man. Ronny, it's cool. Take it easy, man. Ask him if we can do another one. Yeah. Hey, Vito. Yeah, kid? Yeah, can we just run it one more time? Off. Hey, man, you know, Hendrix played here, man. You know what I'm saying? I don't know if we should continue, you know. Hey, mellow the fuck out. He's right, Ronny. You just gotta-- you gotta take it easy. It's cool. Come on. Mikey. * Spent some time * Feelin' inferior * Standin' in front of my mirror * * Combed my hair in a thousand ways * -Hello. -Hey, Mike. What's the point in traveling? I know what you mean, man. The days of Monterey pop are over. * Daddy said, son, you better see the world * You're great company. Huh?

We should talk. You got to lose those redneck retards you've been slumming with, and you got to come with me, and you gotta-- you're a visionary, right? I like the way you think.

You look great. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. I got in. Can you believe it? Here you finally are. Duncan's been asking about you. The real party's in the other room. Okay. Here, let me take that. Have fun. She said I look great. Tammy. Tammy, Tammy, Tammy. Hey. How's it goin'? Good. I'm sorry about this. This was supposed to be just me and you, but the usual. Party, party. Would you like to sit down? Uh-huh. You know what I mean? Nigel, um, could you get him out of here? You are just so, so great. And how many girls have you said that to tonight? 6. Exactly. You're the one I'm taking back to London tomorrow. Oh, yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Once you see London, you'll know why we laugh at L.A. What, like, for the weekend? No. I want you to pack up all your shit and come and be with me for a while. But I...I can't just drop everything. Why? Well, I got friends. Fuck 'em. We'll buy new ones. And what about my shop, huh? That's my job. You can have anything you want. We can be on a plane and be gone before this party's even over. WOMAN: Great show, Duncan. Thank you very much. So... come on. Leave in 2 hours. I call that Barred and Grilled. Inspired by the imaginings of Miss Gina from the seventh veil. That's probably her next door. Probably. These women, you know... designed to elude and confound. Unless... you tell them exactly what they want to hear. And what is that? You understand them and that you... see them as they really are and that you're a shell of a man without them. The thing is that they already know that, you know? They just want to hear it from me. Exactly. That's right, that's right. I'm gonna go get something to eat. Hey, will you, uh... leave the door cracked? I want to listen to the traffic. You want some more coffee? Please. What kinds of jell-os do you have up there? Well, I have red, and I have green. I'll take the green. How much is it for some whipped cream? Uh, it's 25 cents extra. Aw, okay. No, thanks. I'll be sitting over there. Okay. * Ain't it a shame? * Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul * * I wanna get lost in your rock and roll * * And drift away * Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul * * I wanna get lost in your rock and roll * * And drift away I didn't charge you for the whipped cream. Thanks. You're welcome. What can I get you? I'll have a cheeseburger. That's it? -Yeah. -Okay. * The world outside looks so unkind * * I'm countin' on you * To carry me through * Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul * Excuse me. Do you know what time it is? * And drift away It's a little after 4:00. Thanks. * Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul * * I wanna get lost in your rock and roll * * And drift away * now, now, now * Won't you, won't you take me? * I don't want the cheeseburger anymore. I'm sorry. Okay. Hi. I thought I'd catch you here. The party's over? Mm-hmm. I got your pictures. What pictures? Your pictures of me. Thank you. Here. Now, I hope it fits. I had to wing it. Let's see... it's perfect. Now, let me explain it to you, okay? See, this is red, and this is green, and this is red, and this is green. Tammy. What? I want you to be with me. (dishes rattle) (electric guitar playing familiar riff) (plays riff) FELIX: Everybody's lookin' for somethin'. Sometimes when I'm writing a song, I stop and consider the possibility of giving it a happy ending. It makes me feel good. Captioned by Visual Data Media Services
