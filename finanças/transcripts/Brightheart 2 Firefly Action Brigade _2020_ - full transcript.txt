If you're in trouble, just light up your signal lamps, we'll show up. We're... The Firefly Action Brigade. It's a dangerous world. But the Firefly Action Brigade is here to help. Get your signal light ready at the first sign of trouble. We got your back. Oh I can't resist the button. Resist, it's careless bugs like you that give bugs a bad name. Well, it's not food. I'm a bug. Everything's food. You go. Let it follow me. Mama, mama. The signal light. Use it now! Look, I found it. Look out! Bugsy, look out. Bugsy. We've got a beamer. Time for action. Firefly Action Brigade. We're mission go! Everyone, to your bottle caps. I hope this is the right direction because I can't stop! Mission objective reached. Dropping out of hyperspace. Target confirmed. Planet Earth. Hunters, prepare for invasion. Prepare for landing. Hone in on the explorer's beacon. I see the light. Time for action. Looks like we're going deep and dark this time. Just the way I like it. Yahoo! Brightheart, we talked about this. I should go first. No one's stopping you. Get your robot butt down here. Hey, Fiona. I can watch your back. I'm a bullfrog in jet pack. It doesn't get any better than this! Hey, Aurora. Any chance this thing can go a little bit faster? Correct, Frog. It follows your thoughts. - You think fast, you go fast. - Oh, I gotta think about it? There's a first time for everything. I'm still not going fast enough. You're still not thinking hard enough. Buzz off, Beetle. Keep your eyes on the road. I'm blaming you for this. Oh I'm like a cork in a bottle. Brightheart, get me out of here. Again? Lightning bug booty kick. Now it's your turn. No need. I can be the lookout, right? Can you even see? What has 20 teeth and likes to eat frogs? Better go. I guess it's my own fault for being so tasty. I'll rescue you with just my fingers. Here I come. I can feel my butt getting eaten. Brightheart, no more rescues, please. Aurora, do a scan. See where the light signal came from. Life sign detected in this direction. Rescue time! Brightheart, you're here. Please help me. Help me, help me. Don't be afraid. We've got this. Firefly Action Brigade, bring it to me. Aurora, please lift up that vine. Bubbles, use your suit to pull him out. The rest of you, build a stretcher. We need wood to build a stretcher, help me, Albert. Oh my face. My gorgeous face. My baby. You've got to help him. You're in good hands, ma'am. Bugsy. Bugsy, are you okay? Bugsy? He's waking up. He's waking up. Bugsy. Oh, oh you're okay. Great job, everyone. Let's just take him to the hospital for a check up. Oh. It's them! The Firefly Action Brigade. Oh, such a beautiful light. Oh. And poof. The little moth was gone. Lost in the light. You want that to happen to you? Tell me the rules. What are your rules? What do you know? Don't fly too far from home. Never fly into light. Don't talk with your mouth full. We moths can't resist the evil light. Some never learn this lesson. But you, what have you learned? Don't go into the light. Don't forget. Bad news, chief. We have trouble. Trouble in the village. Chief, Larvaboy. He, brought something shiny to the village! He what? Get rid of that thing now! But, Chief. This is a special emergency signal light. Light the light and the Firefly Action Brigade will come. They gave signal lights to all the villages and if we light the light, we'll be safe. Sparkling lights are a trap. Light won't save us. It will probably kill us. The whole tribe. Uh. Well, light doesn't really kill us. Birds kill us and maybe with the signal lights, maybe Brightheart can help us. Throw that thing away. Right now! Oh, look, Chief. It works. The signal light is so bright. Everyone can see it. Chief, the light. Oh, it's so beautiful. Don't look at it. The light is bad luck. But the moon is also a light. I'm trying to protect you from the lights. As long as the moon stays in the sky, I got no beef, but all other light is pure evil. I'm trying to protect you from the lights. See, bad luck. Everyone inside. Into the cave. Run, run! Close it, close it now! Someones in trouble. Wait, Aurora. What happened to the signal? Data from the signal indicates a moth larva has been caught by an owl. Oh, that's not good. Owls are all beaks and class and appetites. And we're it's favorite food. What if-- Never fear, Solomon's here. Nothing can keep me from your side, babe. Predator alert just ahead. Don't eat me! Don't eat me! I have homework to do! I've got this. You go. Maybe I don't have this. Heads up, bird brain. You're on our turf now. Eat a little too much lunch? You're the Firefly Action Brigade. Thank you for helping me. I'm Larvaboy from the moth village and you really can rescue anybody. I saw your bright light. How do you do that? Light on back. Whoa, so cool. What's wrong? Need something more spectacular? Aurora, let's milk this one. Lead me in. Not exactly what I had in mind. You said you wanted to milk it. It's not just that. The chief, the chief he believes that all lights are evil. Light can't be evil. That's crazy. Yeah, that's exactly what I told him, too. Maybe I should try? Where is your village? Huh? Huh? Come on, Please don't cry. Can't you see? I'm trying to protect you. I'm not the bad guy. The lights, the lights are the real enemy. We will black out all the lights. Listen up. The god of moonlight is angry. Black out the lights! The only good light is a bad light. When you dropped the signal light, I wanted to use it to bring you to our village. As you can see, we have a bird problem. We have to do something to keep it from using our village as it's own personal restaurant. The Firefly Action Brigade is officially on the job. How you gonna do it? How you gonna beat the bird? Our methods are on a need to know basis. Which means that we don't even know ourselves Until we do it. Wow, top secret stuff. Yeah, something like that. Alert, incoming bugs. It's the Chief! Hey Chief, I didn't get eaten. What? Is that, Larvaboy? Huh, I thought he'd be bird poop by now. Chief, those are the guys that made the shiny lights. What? It looks like Larvaboy has betrayed us. Battle stations. What? They're welcoming committee has such style. We have to step up our game. We have to show 'em, show 'em that the Firefly Action Brigade has style, too. Firefly Action Brigade, assemble. Chief, they're going to attack. Charge! Is that how moths say hello? No! But they saved me. They're here to help us. You're brainwashed. They brought the shiny lights. They must be our real enemies. What did I ever do to you? Stop poking at me. Secret weapons. Take no prisoners. Seriously? This is your idea of a welcome? You're gonna have to do better than that! Albert, teach them a lesson. Over here. Take out the one with the shining butt. Huh, Aurora, help! Don't let them escape. Let's all go together. Ready? Together, together, together. A trick. It's a trick. We need insect repellent. Look out! Oh. You betrayed your tribe. You need a good spanking. Don't do this. This was only to get you close. Low battery again? No, it is a spaceship from my home planet. I have been signaled to join them immediately. You mean there are others out there like you? I do not have exact information. Hey, we're not finished here, come back. They're here to help us. He's right. Why won't you at least listen? Chiefs only talk, they never listen. Come on, let's help Aurora find her friends. Brightheart wait, wait. You, you're with me. The rest make sure there are no shiny lights left in the village. Brightheart, why the long face? Fine. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. All you can do is be there when they need you. Right! And I'll always be there for you. Those moths nearly killed me. Aurora, they couldn't hurt you. You can never die. It is different for us, yes. As long as my head is okay, the rest of me can be rebuilt from spare parts. Oh, not me. My head is my weakest part and my stomach does all the talking. The chief didn't understand us at all. If I can just explain things to him. We all need the light in our lives. Brightheart, what is this place? Aurora, why did your people come to our planet now? Your planet is an alien world to us. It is not yet in our database. Are they hiding out somewhere from us? Huh? They are establishing a base. I must find the signal. We'll help you find your friends. We can cover more ground if we split up. Thank you for your help, Firefly Action Brigade. If you find them first, just use the signal light and I will come to you. This is a big place to search and it might be dangerous. So let's work in a team. Aurora, Edward, look on the north of the village. Bubbles, Albert, you're with me. Solomon, Fiona, search on the south side. So, we make a great team, don't you think? I wonder if Aurora's friends back home looks like she does? Who cares? Whatever they look like, they can never match my bug eyed charm. Huh? Whoa. Fiona, my gossamer beauty. Sweets for the sweet. Oh, Fiona, Fiona. Where are thou? Better not. Maybe, maybe she's playing hard to get! Oh. Sugar lips! Come out, come out wherever you are. - Help! - Huh? Help me! Help! Aurora, I don't want to scare you or anything but I'm really scared. Force disturbance. Over here. Oh, sweetie pie! It's me, your beetle boy. Huh? Help me. Flashing red? That's never ever a good thing. Losing control. I am being hacked. Ah, Aurora. No offence, but I think that's not a good color on you. Aurora! Look, we found it. This must be their spaceship. Can't eat it, can't play ball with it. Huh? Looks like someone's tail. Disgusting! Ew, ew, ew, ew. Oh, who would do something like that? This is a lot bigger than Aurora's spaceship. Hey? Huh? We better call up Aurora. She'll know exactly what to do. Wait! You light that in here and no one will see it. Huh? Greetings, my name is Brightheart, we come in peace. Wait, you're supposed to say that. Huh, huh? Any friend of Aurora's is a friend of ours. Let's shake on it. You can see, Aurora is helping us. We're the Firefly Action Brigade, at your service. Ta-da. What are you doing? Let Bubbles go! You lied to me, moth brain. You'd said you'd let her go if I gave up. Let her go! You're trying to trick my tribe. So I tricked you, Solomon. You're gonna be the one who helps me get the others. No way, you dork! Silence them. Stay back, stay back! Leave her alone! Aurora! - Hey, Aurora, over here. - Hey, Aurora. - Over here. - Aurora to the rescue. Hey, what's with the new color? You got a new girlfriend? Or maybe it was just some grub you ate? I command you to stand down. These are my prisoners. Huh? No, no. Give her back! Fiona! I think the red has gone to your brain. You call that rescuing? Eh, rescue me too! Crazy bug, it's not a rescue. It's a heist. Chief, looks like you're right. It's not a rescue. Nonsense. Hey, red bot give her back or face the wrath of the bug! Incoming! Not the antenna, not the antenna! Solomon, what are you doing? Aurora, they took Bubbles and Albert. You've got to save them. Give me back my Fiona. Give me back my people! Aurora, what is happening to you? We are here to capture new species. These are the hunters here to gather specimens to take back to our home world for research. Study? What for? We feed them and watch them grow. - Huh? - Oh, free food? Take me away, too. Then we dissect them. I get it, you're the real enemy. Aurora, did you come just to hurt us? My mission was to find new worlds, new species and report back to my home world. Aurora, but you were my friend. When my ship crashed, I forgot my mission. Now I remember. How can you be so stupid? Robots don't have friends or feelings. Aurora, you can't forget our friendship. You're part of the Firefly Action Brigade. No cage can hold me! Solomon! Aurora, what have you done!? This is all your fault. Thinking you can make friends with a killer robot. I thought you were the protector, the rescuer. Clever Brightheart. Well find a clever way to get us out of here. Brightheart, I still really believe in you. Listen, this isn't really Aurora's fault. The hunter's hacked her systems. Hacked? They must of gotten into her head. Then that means we could turn her back! But, none of us are hackers. How do we turn her back? We will collect the remaining specimens from this planet. Aurora, you must perform the medical tests to make sure they are compatible with our home world. I will obey. Edward, Edward! Aurora, keep it simple. Start with the frogs. Not all prickly, like the mantis. What? Is this about the money I owe you? 'Cause I'm good for it. Oh. Hey, iron butt. Come and get me. Oh you tin faced dork. Come on! Albert, Albert! Go on, get out of here. Hurry before they come back. Go on and save yourselves. Hold on. We'll be back. I promise you. Down there, a cave. It's our only hope. I can't believe we left Albert behind. And my Fiona, too. I had no choice. But if we're free, we can help them. The light. Must get to the light. Hey, knock it off! Snap out of it. Like I've been saying, shining lights are dangerous and must be snuffed out. Funny, you were just saved by the light. Oh liar liar, pants on fire. I'm the one giving you protection here. Oh, is that what you're doing? Well, of course. Would you rather I let you go on your own? Well that might just be a good idea. Oh no! Right or left? Red wire or blue wire. Don't make me choose. I'll choose. Follow me. Huh? Chief, come on. You snooze you lose. I prefer the darkness. At least you're consistent. This place creeps me out. I smell a rat. I've never seen a rock formation like that before. Look at those two holes. Yup, there seems to be some wind coming from these two holes. We must be near the way out. Okay, whoever loses rock, paper, scissors will reach into these holes. Rock, paper, scissors. Yeah! I fall for that every time. You lost. You pay the cost. Gadzooks. There's no way that's a firefly sneeze. - It's coming! - Run, run, run! It's gaining on us! - Don't look back! - Don't just stand there, run! Move it! You crazy firefly. What have you done this time? Come on. Once we're out of the tunnel, it can't catch us. Can feel the wind now. We're almost out. This way. No more tricks! There, that's the way out. I'm not staying for lunch. Cheater! I don't have to be faster than him. Just faster than you! Uh oh. The mole, he was afraid of the light. Yeah, just like you. I fear nothing. Nothing except a firefly butt. We can't stay here. We'll have to try another tunnel. Hopefully no one lives in this tunnel. We escaped. Now we got to go rescue our friends. After all of that, and you're just gonna go back into danger? Look out! I really hate aliens. Wait a minute. How did Aurora know we were gonna be here? Well, I've been carrying this thing around ever since Aurora gave it to me. You idiot! Aurora, snap out of it. Fight it, don't get hacked. We have the leaders. Get the others. I'm not a fighter but I know how to pose. And I know kung-fu, judo, TaeKwonDo, karate, and a lot of other ancient arts! You really know all that? Come on, let's do this. Go! Solomon, Solomon no! Edward! You want to pick on somebody, pick on me. Brightheart, after I defeat them, save the others. Edward! This ends now. They're my friends! Brightheart. I will always be your friend. How can she change her programming? It's just not possible. The wavelength of that light. I've never seen anything like that. This creature. We must have this energy for our home world. We must have this at all costs. This is their world, we are the aliens. We are intruders. Release them now. This creature can benefit our home world. We must have this energy at all costs. Resistance is futile. They cannot stop us and neither can you. You are just a malfunctioning robot. You must understand them before you can understand the power they have. This power changed my programming and it can change yours, too. If you let it. You will never know it by force only by understanding and cooperation. This great power has a name, they call it friendship. Preach it. This concept is illogical. Brightheart, my friend, I have no weapon systems. I cannot save you. Wait, idea detected. By reversing polarity on my power system I can created a lethal cascade effect. What do you mean? Self destruction. Aurora! Disable him now! They will ever know friendship but I will always have you in my heart. My friend, go and save the others. Reversing polarity in three. - No! - Two, one. Brightheart, give me some light. I can't see my dinner. Oh come on, everyone else is already here. What they're trying to say is, we need you, Brightheart. Brightheart, you're the best. Get up. Where are you? Bubbles. I'm right here. Huh? Oh Aurora, Aurora. So sorry. You called me friend but I couldn't save you. I couldn't save anybody. I'm so sorry. Aurora! Aurora? My friend, go and save the others. Aurora! I can't bring you back. But I won't let you down again. Chief, what happened to Brightheart and her friends? Right now, I have bigger fish to fry. Chief, oh chief. You're not gonna believe this. What now? The bright butt. What? The bright butt, it's, it's right out there. What? Huh? Brightheart! What do you want? We have to go rescue them. They're our people. You're a funny bug. Insects against alien robots from outer space. This spear is only good for poking other bugs. We'll fight together with our heads and our hearts. It's not our fight. It's a fight for our whole planet. If they take me today, they'll take you tomorrow. and then you and you. If we don't face our enemy together we will all face them separately. Chief, is that what you really want? Chief, we will follow you to victory. You know nothing. Didn't you hear what I said before? These are space aliens. How can I fight against that? So you're just going to give up? Like that? We cannot beat them. So we're going to avoid them. - Chief! - Huh? Chief, Chief, Chief! Don't tell me. You're not gonna believe this. It's a robot alien. Hide, find the deepest hole you can. I have an idea. He said there's only one of them. I say divide and conquer. They did the dividing, we'll do the conquering. Who's we, little bug? Okay, you beat this one, I'll help with the rest. Listen. Brightheart, she defeated the bird. The bird? You bet. No bug has ever beaten the bird but they did it and if they can do that then they can surely stop whatever you're afraid of. Brightheart has proven that together, we can do anything. Chief, please keep your word. Hey, gear head, looking for me? No, she doesn't have her team. She's nuts. Bring it! It's working. Brightheart! Oh, I hate crash landings. Yeah, all right. Yes! Right, so here's the number one plan. You ready? Destroy their ships so they can't kidnap anyone, then take out the bots one by one. You're still one crazy firefly but we owe you! Look, who's that? Edward! Brightheart. Aurora. This is all my fault. You were always my true friend. She's gone. Tell me, what happened last night? After the explosion, I woke up and went looking for you. Brightheart, are you there? Oh no. Aurora! Huh? The robots, they were still alive. What are we gonna do, Brightheart? Wait a minute. Maybe we can save her. Do you remember what she said? She can be rebuilt as long as her head survives. We can rebuild Aurora. But where will we ever find the parts? Huh? I know. The suit Aurora made for Bubbles. I'm sure it's still here. It's got to be. Shouldn't it be doing something, anything? This might help. Woah. Aurora. Aurora. Aurora, you're back. Greetings friends. Shake hands. Brightheart, Edward, thank you for restoring me. Your body. It is acceptable. Once I get back to my ship, I can make it as good as new. Amazing. Okay. Meanwhile, we got an alien infection to stop. I don't get it. It's on. Is there no security? Don't touch that. Everybody get back. Battle stations. Gotta get out of here. Like I told you. We can't fight this. No, look it can be stopped. Create a diversion. I can hack into its system and shut it down. How can we help? Uh huh. No! Look out! Hooray. Yay! Aurora! What happened? My head is intact but my body does not work. I am helpless and there is not enough power for me to self destruct again. Never again. We stand and we fight. All bugs stand down or be destroyed. Not today, gear head. You will now face the wrath of Edward. Freedom! Count me in. Stay tight and follow my lead. This planet belongs to the bugs. Together we're invincible! Chief, look. So what? We're in this fight and we're in it to win. You do not have the power to defeat the droids. Our powers in our friends. Huh? Oh. Thanks. Hi. Mothman, the Firefly Action Brigade, the band is back together. You heard right. It's me. We must squash them like, well, bugs. Follow me to victory! Chief, I got your back. I don't know how to fight them. We've never faced an enemy like this before. I've battled fires, shiny lights, and even humans. But these guys are just kicking our butts. Help, get out of my way. Fire, fight. Humans, humans? Humans! I know what to do now. I don't. Get back! My name is Brightheart. I am a superhero. I bring the light. Let's fly, robot. Oh wait, where's my jet pack? Go, brigade to the rescue. Right behind you. Not yet. I can upgrade you to superheroes. Huh? Poor beast. Where's Brightheart? She can't fight off these alien fiends herself. Brightheart, I'm coming. You are defeated. You will come with us. The darkness will never defeat the light because the light never gives up. I know what you're thinking. Is he alone, or does he have his army with him? The real question is, are you feeling lucky? Chief, seriously? Hey, bug breath, bring it on. Brightheart! Chief! What are you gonna do? Hi. Hey, you, Mothman. Save some bug kicking for the rest of us. Brightheart, now I'm not just a cutie. I'm also the best dressed! And me, I've gone from loser to legend. All thanks to you, Aurora. Not much left of your ship, I'm afraid. And a little upgrade for you, while you're at it. I hope I don't mess this up. Custom made just for the chief. I know just what to do with this. Let's rumble! Take that. Firefly Action Brigade assemble. We won't lose this time. Any last robot requests? Red bots transform. Start the rage mode. So now they do tricks? You have no idea. Take cover! He turned into a red bowling ball? O.M.G. Take that! Gotcha. Yay. Oh. Yeah. Chief! Let him go, let him go. Brightheart! It's coming. Get back, get away from the tracks. He's got her, stop him. Ready? Let's go fishing. One chance! You've gotta push this up on the track. Do it now! There's no time. I don't think that's very safe. It's the only way any of us have a chance. I see what she is trying to do but she has a one percent chance of success. There's got to be another way. I'm open to suggestion. Firefly Action Brigade, I believe in you. On my count, put your shields around Brightheart. Three. Two. One! Watch out. Don't let it call the mothership. Chief, care to join the Firefly Action Brigade? Well then I'd be the cute one. At the first sign of trouble. Just turn on and shine your signal light. We've got your back. We're the Firefly Action Brigade! Get ready for the secret scene. ♪ The moonlight ♪ ♪ It shines bright ♪ ♪ And gives light below ♪ ♪ The world is a brighter place ♪ ♪ With you by my side ♪ ♪ Friendships are like the light ♪ ♪ That shines forth our joy ♪ ♪ So take my hand ♪ ♪ And walk with me now ♪ ♪ Let your light shine ♪ ♪ Send out your love ♪ ♪ Together we can ♪ ♪ Make a change in the world ♪ ♪ Let your light shine ♪ ♪ Send out your love ♪ ♪ Your love ♪ ♪ Your love ♪ ♪ Together ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ The world is a brighter place ♪ ♪ Wherever you go ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ Your light shows we're never alone ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ The world is a brighter place ♪ ♪ Wherever you go ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ Your light shows we're never alone ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ The world is a brighter place ♪ ♪ Wherever you go ♪ ♪ Firefly shine ♪ ♪ Firefly glow ♪ ♪ Your light shows we're never alone ♪ I have analyzed the eyes of moths and these will protect you from the danger of shiny objects and lights.

Stay out there, Solomon. I'm not saving your butt ever again. You don't really think I'd do anything stupid, do you? Solomon, whatever you do, Don't push any Right, got you. You said push the button to open the door. Good plan. What an idiot. It's going to blow. Whoa, Aurora, Can he turn the ship around? Come back? I've analyzed his IQ and no. Where will it take him? Depends how many buttons he pushed. Brightheart, are you thinking what I think you're thinking? You all know me so well, right? Almost forgot, I got a thing. We can go and save Solomon. Use my spaceship we can track him. Uh oh. Firefly Action Brigade, let's roll!
