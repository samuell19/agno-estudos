GHASTLY BROTHERS GHOST HUNTERS Are you sure we're not supposed to be over there? No, this is the place. Your thinking too much in clichés. Let's go. Hello? It's the Ghastly Brothers! May we enter? Hans, go get your stuff. Can I use my Sixth Sensor? Can it be trusted? Guaranteed not to blow up anymore! I think. Jesus, shhht! You're going to scare them away! - But isn't that the point? THE GHASTLY BROTHERS Hello? Time for step one. Come on, hand it over. Maybe develop your own Sixth Sensor for once? Probably doesn't work anyway. Wait. Yes! Aha, image is coming through! Yeah, I upgraded the imaginocity chip, so that it has an anti-ratio function and the perception is now in full colour. But it does feel very loose on the head. That's because it's my Sixth Sensor! you don't have a big enough imagination. Stop nagging, Hans. WOUT'S PATENTED GHOST ENCYCLOPEDIA Do you see something? Hmm. Well, Hans? FInding anything? Hmm. Walt? Yes? I've got a sighting. Look at that! A Grouch! What? Yeah! But that's a ridiculous name! No it isn't. A gruesome couch! But that doesn't sound professional at all! It makes so much sense! - Always with the horrible word puns! I don't see the problem. Every single time! What are you saying? Boo hoo! I'm Hans and I ... - This is totally unprofessional! Ouch. That Grouch is hungry. Very hungry. I think those pencils are giving him an upset stomach. What else does a Grouch like to eat? It's time for step two. Loose change. Chip crumbs. Crisps. Yes! Keys! Weren't that the keys to the van? Crap. It's obviously not working. Walt, what is the biggest object you can lose in a couch? Remote controls! Yes! It's working! I told you. Hello, sir. Hans, he's trying to escape! Come here! Barricade the perimeter! Just a second, sir. Look, Hans. I found the perfect spot. Sir. How often do your customers use the toilet? Who? Does sir have a name? Mark, with a K. What is he saying? It's Mark, with a K! Kark? Well Kark, Im afraid your costumers, will have to hold it in a little longer! Sorry, sir. Hans, come! Time for step three. Ja. Just one second. TOILETS Voila. Out of sight. Out of mind. What happened? One Grouch. I think it would be best if Kark would take a shower. And don't forget to scrub underneath your fingernails, sir. Where do you come from? From Stonechurch Road. A customer was experiencing an ornithological paranormal phenomenon. Look, Hans. A Poultrygeist! Ah. Poultrygeist is still a stupid name. But who are you guys? Haven't I introduced us yet? We're the Ghastly Bro- Gluttony. Is it a crime? According to my book it is. I found you out, buddy. You've got nowhere to go. The curtain ... ... drops. I followed your tracks. All the way to the ripped bag of dog food. And you can't blame it on Bluetooth. Because his feline bite marks, are twice as short as your greedy mouth. But ... ... That wasn't enough. You went looking for your next victim. And the night ... ... lured you to the living room. Where you stabbed Rex in the back, with a giant butcher's knife! It seems our first eyewitness has arrived. Lily, I'm home. It is I. Mister ... Neighbour. And I am the ... ... eyewitness. That's right. I'm your most important eyewitness. Yes, madam inspector. I saw it all with my own eyes. It was him! That one there with the evil look and cute twinkly eyes. Did you hear that, Wifi? Mister Neighbour saw everything. Everything. How ... ... handy. Maybe a bit too handy. Show me your hands! There's nothing to see. Except ... ... for the blood. Of that stupid prehistoric carnivore! Halt! Or I'll shoot! Lily! Dammit. Turn on the lights, quick. It's okay. Good. Can we continue? Sure, but did you pack your bags? I'm not seeing it anywhere. Unless there's a body hidden inside? I didn't pack by bags. What? Lily, come on. It's past midnight. I'm not going to that boarding school. Upstairs. Now! Bored-ing school! Lilith Lilith Sorry that I exist. Look, it's only temporary. And I know it's pretty far but ... Far? It's literally on the other side of the world. Yes. New-Zealand is only a day away. Technically speaking. Sweetheart, those birds need me. And I need you too. And I need you here. Come on, get out of that closet. Sweetheart. I'm one of three people on this entire planet, that has the chance to study the Kakapo bird from up close. Stupid bird. Lilith. This job is important to me. Well, let me help you then. I'm a good team player and won't get in your way. Look. That's my old Polaroid. That was broken. Didn't I throw it away? You did, and I took it back and fixed it. Look, the shutter didn't work anymore. I added a drop of olive oil, so it could work a bit smoother. I tied a rubber band around this part because it was worn out. The solution is often simpler than the problem. Thats what Silvia Shadowlight always says. You sure like tinkering. You should do something with that. By the way. At the boarding school they have this huge workshop, where you can tinker and hammer and fix... Very smooth, mom. Really. Lilith. Its just the way it has to be. My work happens to involve studying rare birds. And these birds happen to live all the way in New Zealand. But what about me? And Wifi? And Bluetooth? I love you very much. And Wifi. And Bluetooth. And I also love my job. Shitty birds. Lilith. Just leave me. That's a good bird. Theres just one thing you forgot, miss Shadowlight. And that is that evil always prevails! Lilith? Goodmorning, sweetheart. Lilith, could you please take that? It might be New Zealand. What, the entire country? Hi, this is the Reinaert family, Merel is currently flipping the bird. Shell call you right back. Very mature. Mom, ive given this a lot of thought. And ive decided im not going to that boardingschool. First of all. -Lily, seriously. Theres a time and a place for everything and this isnt it. We should have left five minutes ago. By the way, I made pancakes. With fresh blueberries. Mom, I hate blueberries. You know that. Shit. You're right. Without blueberries. Never mind. I'm not hungry anyway. And please put on your clothes. Or we're gonna be... Late. So, did you finish your new book? Can I read it when you're done? Look out where you're driving! I guess you want to be a rude one too! Man, really. Are you stupid? Not too shabby, huh? Lily, come on, enough is enough, get out, now! No running down the hall. John, look where you're going. Arthur, go outside with that ball. Girls, ceasefire. Now! Amelie, your shoe's untied. What do I see there? Chewing gum? Put that in the bin where it belongs. Come on, Marie. Now! Kids, you know the rules. No running down the hallw- Kristof! What? Come on, boy. No need to be so dramatic. You know you're allowed to go outside. You have to be Lilith. Right? Kristof! Out of the way! Watch out! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Sure looks cosy here. Out of the way! Good idea. You go check out your room. Ill go to the reception to sign some papers. Weren't you wearing different pants? Nope, that's not true. Jimmy has the top bunk! Hi! I'm Margot. You're Lilith! Where did you get that name? I'm sleeping with you. That's Kasper. Kasper is hilarious. Oh! Can I take a picture? Argh. My head hurts. Could you guys keep it down? I'm trying to study. Study? You goof. You study the day before the test. Or the day itself. How else will you have time to collect snails? Snails...or chewing gum. Would you like to see my collection? My favorite flavour is blue. Thanks, do you also happen to have a tissue collection? It really was super fun to say hello. Now its snailtime. Bye! Uh oh ... Watch out! Out of the way! Watch out! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Lilith? Lilith, can you please be here? With me? Lilith, I really have to go. Please? Argh. My head hurts. Hans! Its not going to explode, right? No. Everything is under control. I think. Hans? -I took the batteries out. Don't panic. Ah, looks like I didnt take the batteries out. Silly me. Hans, you know I'm not a fan of things blowing up in my face for no apparent reason. Understandably so. Imagine... Walt Ghastly, fan of things blowing up in his face for no apparent reason. Nice title for your biography though. I've got a title for your biography. Go on. Hans... ... Wurst. The story of a silly sausage. Hanswurst. Right. Time for some self promotion! Scrap metal. Give us your scrap, iron and lead. Ghosts, poltergeists, paranormal pests. Call the Ghastly Brothers, and well do the rest! Why are you talking funny? Mysterious screaming or a ghostly knock. Call the Ghastly Brothers and well solve it like a paranormal Sherlock! Do you really think that's going to work? How can we be of assistance, sir? Well. It's actually very simple. Step one, we spot the paranormal pest. Aha! Spotted. Step two! They have been caught and are a bit angry. Time to stun them. An Exercist! Fascinating. Hello, madam. - Doing great, Hans. Brilliant. A fantastic example of Phantom power. Ice. Fright. Freezer. Oh, pizza! A Frightdge! Still a stupid name. Don't complain Hans. You're doing a good job. Really? Magnificent. A Gnasty Gnome. Nibbles away at your vegetables and before you know it, its all gone! Luckily not as bad as a Zombee. And what's step three? - Step three? Lock'em up. Good riddance. Voila. Out of sight, out of mind. MUSAC? Musically Universal Sound Absorbing Containment. Or MUSAC for short. Ideally for ignoring the monster in your closet..or garden shed! It's got three songs! I... -Shht. This is my favourite. But now I've got that thing locked up in my shed. I presume there's a step four, right? We can't just keep this door shut like this? That thing cannot possibly be h- There we go. A rampant Exercist. And Hans cycled about 24 miles to get him tired. So thats one hundred twenty three euros please thank you. Huh, yeah right! Delayed payment? No problem at all. We expect your money within fourteen calendar days. Another job well done. Well done? Miss? May I- No! Not now, Jimmy. It's about your future. THE FUTURE We still have a few days left until the job fair starts. A day that will give you a glimpse into the future. And what you might mean for our society. Did everyone write down their choice of job? Yes, Miss Appleblaum. Doctor. Veterinary. Good. Very good. Butcher. Tourist? Tourist is not a job, Kristof. Okay. Here we go again. Cowboy. Another cowboy. Astronaut. Paranormal detective? Who was that? Silence! Stand up, who was that? Me. Ah, the new girl. Well. You all need to be more realistic with your choices. We can't all be ballerina or astronaut. Lilith. What is a realistic job choice for you? Detective. Paranormal Detective. Archeologist. Archeologist? Sure, Detective of old things. Lilith, I asked you to name realistic jobs. Well yeah. Archeologist, Detective, Par- Parking manager, Human Resource Manager. Receptionist. Please sit down. Very good, Lilith. Thank you very much. Im not here to crush your dreams. But the chances of any of you becoming an astronaut are almost non existent. But...I really do want to be a detective. Like Sylvia Shadowlight. You mean Sylvia Shadowlame. Shut your face Kristof! Kristof! Margot! Jimmy! Sylvia Shadowlight doesnt exist. She was made up by someone with too much free time on their hands. Theres no such thing as ghosts and goblins. There are ghost hunters. Yes. Look, Ill tell you what. Ill check out these Gnarly Brothers. But I don't promise anything. But if I dont find anything, this will be the last I hear about it. Deal? Okay. That's a deal then. Watch out. Watch out! Out of the way! Wait! I'm carrying all by books. Now that is a very nice birdhouse, Lilith. But... Didn't we forget something? The entrance. No birds allowed at the Lilith residence. Okay. Pretty. TO MY ADVENTUROUS SHADOW LIGHT LOVE, DAD Wait. I have another good joke that Robin told me. Why do birds fly south during the winter? Because walking would take too long. Lily. I am your mother. Look, Lilith. This bird always reminds me of you. It also likes to give an angry look. Come on, give us a smile. NEW ZEALAND (ECHNICALLY SPEAKING 1 DAY LATER) It's time. It. Is. Time! See that tiny beak. We did it! I have to call Lilith. Tell her the good news. She doesn't pick up, again. Come. We take some pictures and movies. And then when she turns on her mobile phone, she's going to see it. Sent. She's gonna like that. As if she was here with us. I hope so. Merel, take it from me. Kids tend to forgive things like that. I will never forgive you! -Never? Never ever ever! Please, Socky, I love you. Okay. Your breath smells. No, your breath smells. No, yours does. Hey, I've got gum. Oh, my favourite flavour is blue. Mine too. Look. Hey. -Shht! I am studying for maths and geography at the same time. That way I save precious time. Do you know the total length of all rivers in Belgium? What are you saying? You can't study them both at the same time. You're right. Maybe French and PE. Un, deux, trois, quatre. Bonjour, monsieur. Pour moi un pain complet, s'il vous plaît. Avec deux croissants. Don't get so worked up. Your head will explode. Je m'excuse, Lilith. Je suis busy working on mon vocabulary. Oh no. If my calculations are correct ... Then Ms Appelblaum gives an unexpected test about the integrals. Oh, integrals! Is that like principles? But then without the princes. And are their princessaples? That live in a castle? Kasper. It's just some grades. Grades are super important. How else are mom and dad going to love me? Feeding time. SNAIL CIRCUS Lilith, come and see. Oscargot can almost jump through a hoop. Okay, I need to see this. I'll be right back. Ouch. Ah! Kasper, you need to see this. It's incredible. Hey. What was that? I already told you. Cosine, Sine, Tangent. The integrals. No, I didn't mean that. I thought.. -I thought! I thought! I also thought I was thinking. But I'm dumb. No thinking here. Principles! Enough! Time for something else. Do you have any hobbies? Is maths a hobby? No. Something physical? Physics? Come, let's go play ping pong. Ping pong? Dentist. Paranormal Detective. Lilith. Let's see. Getaleria Guisseppe. Ghetto Records Inc. The Ghastly Brothers. Ghost hunters. Well okay. Wait. What are we doing? It's kind of my birthday. What? And you didn't tell us? Here a small gift. Chocolate. It's actually for my snails. But they prefer salty crackers. they always fizzle with joy and then they instantly fall asleep. Thanks. You sure are the kindest snail mom I know. I know, right? But maybe you should try to give them some lettuce from time to time? You know, to change things up? Snails don't eat salad. My turn. And also a happy birthday from me. What are you reading? Sylvia Shadowlight And The Wearisome Werewolves of Wichita. I dont think I can learn something from that. Sure you can. In this story she makes this genius contraption. Which traps the werewolves and so she is heralded as the hero of the village. What are you reading? Elementary... ...Differential... ...Equations And... ...Boundary... ...Value Problems. Sounds exciting. Here, maybe you should read this. Oh, thanks! its your birthday and youre giving me a present? This doesn't make sense. The gift is that we can talk about the book after you finished it. Do you think theyll have doctors on the job fair? Or baker? Maybe an ice cream tester? That should be a real job. I'm gonna be an ice cream tester! I dont think thats a realistic career path. And detective? Lilith, youve got a phone call. -Yes. It's your mother. By the way, those ghosthunters of yours have replied. And they're coming to the job fair. Really, ghosthunters? -Really. Just promise me youll also check out the other booths, okay? I will. -Okay. Why dont you answer my calls? This is the automatic answering machine of Lilith Reinaerts. She currently cant come to the phone. Because she is busy being declared independent from her mother. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep. Lilith, please. Don't be like this. Hey, it's your birthday! Congratulations, My little girl is growing up. Hows it going with your new friends? And how are the teachers? Lilith, I know this is hard for you. I still have to stay here the entire night, alone. A new nest of Kakapo's just hatched this morning. It's super rare! Did you get my pictures? Maybe. Did you get presents from your new friends? Nope. I gave a book away and got nothing in return. By the way, I dont like it that I'm spending my birthday alone. Lily, sweetheart. I miss you too, you know? I'm also alone. Yeah, I can hear that. And now Im having to share my birthday with a bunch of kakabirds! Kakapo ... Wasn't the chocolate enough? What? I didn't know telephone wires were tasty. Something weird is going on here. Weird? Like my mom thinks Im weird? or more like "this drawing of an elephant has five legs" weird? You didn't see anything strange? I see everything. Everything. Everything I get why your mom thinks you're weird. Everything. Everything. We're too late. Walt, wake up! We have overslept. Hans, you've overslept. We're late for the job fair. Job fair? Job fair! What time is it? We should really do something about that clock. But Hans. That's the Zeitgeist. A ghost that can haunt for exactly one second each day. Would it consider the roman calendar ? And what does it do with daylight saving time? Does it consider the haunting hour at midnight? Or the less traditional three a clock? We're late. Lilith. Wake up. Or we're going to eat you. And then you'll be late. It's the job fair! Good morning, Margot. - Which shirt do you guys think? The left. No, the right. No, the left. No, the right. I'm lefthanded, so I would know best. I'm righthanded, so I would know best. I don't want to be a lawyer! - Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! OPEN JOB DAY Om nom nom. Free salami. THE FULL COW Salami. And if you would like to know how it ends up on your plate? Then let me tell you about the wonderful world of the slaughterhouse! Gobstoppers. Gummy bears. Sour drops. Dots. Marshmellows. Or a simple lollipop. Eat them now, and I'll fix it later. Attention, jobseekers. The workshop "how to overcome procrastination" Has been postponed indefinitely. But the course on how to read the clock starts in exactly ... Uh ... Wait. Uh ... Just a sec... Just one. Hey, you. Are you looking for excitement? Adventure? Surprises around every corner? Yeah? From the far west to mysterious east? Yeah! Look no further. With Travel Ageny Adventourista you can help people book exciting holidays. Across the whole world. Be an investigator looking for the daily deals and exciting sales. So, we're not going on an adventure ourselves? Hahaha! No, girl. Leave that to the tourists. But who knows your colleagues at work... are even more adventurous! Aha! Starting without us, are we? Sorry, we're late. Ghastly ghosthunters. Nice to meet you. Nice booth. Did it get more quiet now that we arrived? We do stick out I guess. Well, we're just as ... ... hardworking as everyone else here. Oh, sorry. PALMISTRY So cool. Hey Lilith, do you know what you want to be when you grow up? Jimmy wants to be a filmmaker. The Third Face? 'Cub' meets 'De Kampioenen'. With Nero as a zombie? Actually, what have you been doing since Cub? Weren't you wearing other pants? No, it just looks that way. Oh, is it them? Are you the ghosthunters? Precise! Just as precise as a priest praying for an exorcism. You can find us in the Yellow Pages between Getaleria Guisseppe and Ghetto Records Inc. What are the Yellow Pages? Are you guys the Ghostbusters? Do we look like guys who chase ghosts with a vacuum-cleaner on our backs? Ghosts aren't real! You're not real! Look, kids. It's very simple. When you have a house ... ... and inside that house is a ghost. Then we try to catch that ghost. But... We cant take it away from the house or the house might start acting weird. Or even decay. Because every pot needs a lid. As every house has its ghost. This book ... ... contains all the ghosts we discovered. With the required remedies and resolutions. BROTHERS Wait. What about the ghosts that dont have a house anymore? Because it got burned down or... Or destroyed? Well lookie here, check out our table with cool gadgets and stuff! Check out my Sixth Sensor. Made it myself. And why's it called the "Sixth" Sensor? This one works. Can I try? Okay, but be careful. Ooh, what's this? That's a Spectrometer. Hands off! Ooh, and this? Those are the oracle cards of Hercule Tarot. Ooh, and this? That's paper. To write stuff on. Ooh! Okay, this just got boring. Im gonna go. Bye! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Margot? But if there are so many ghosts, why cant we see them? Funny enough, there are new types discovered every day. They say its a bit like the sea. Its so deep, we would never be able to discover all the different species. Hey! Landlubber! Stay away from our metaphors! To each his own! Freeloader. Hey look! Jimmy pissed his pants again! Jimmy Bedpee. Jimmy. Jimmy Bedpee! Jimmy Bedpee! Jimmy, it doesn't matter. It happens to everyone. It happens a little more often with you than with the other children, but ... Not true! Not true! Jimmy did not pee his pants! Jimmy did not pee his pants! Did you just see that? Stay calm. No need to run. The professionals are here. We've got everything under control. That wasn't meant to happen. Aren't you guys gonna do something? A classic. The White Spirit! Stupid name. Fabric softener. We didn't pack any. Darn. And the launderette booth is already washed out. Hey! Swiffer! Sorry. So sorry. Yup. Sorry. Free pony ride at Tony's horse riding school. Time to do the dirty laundry. Ooh! Ah! Lilith! Over here! Come on! - Push! I capitulate. I surrender to my fate and welcome my new master, the phantom. Please, spare me! Hello, madam. Don't panic. The ghost is is safely locked away. Expertly handled by the Ghastly Brothers. But this doesn't solve anything! Can't it escape? No, don't worry. We've used special silver nails. Twice as strong against paranormal scum. And do you just leave it here? It's a nice little box. People pay a lot for a good vintage. Maybe as a coffee table? So shall we send the bill to this address? So. That was it? Just lock it up? Look girl, we have already covered many White Spirits in our time. Surely this is just a matter of common sense? White Spirit? For such a snake-like creature that is a very bad name. Wait, snake-like? Don't you mean more like flapping or draping? No, I saw something snake-like crawl out of Jimmy's pants. First of all, girl. Yuck. And secondly, leave it to the adults. You go and study or play or talk about babysitters or something. Go on. But I want to help. And Im sure youre a wonderful little helper. But we are the Ghastly Brothers, not the Ghastly Daycare. Look. You keep your eyes open and your senses sharp. If you see anything strange, let us know! But I saw something. I saw another creature. Inside Margot. Inside Margot? -Yes. I saw it with your special goggles. The Sixth Sensor! Did you maybe see it somewhere? Hans, did you lose it again? - No, no! That's already the umpteenth time you lose it! No, no. Now we're at the Sixth Sensor. It was laying there somewhere and then ... And now we're going to need a Seventh Sensor! I think the baker took it and ran and ... And then it's going to be the Eighth Sensor. And there's lots of kids running around and... And then it's the Twentieth Sensor! This time, I swear I saw the baker steal it from us. The baker? Ah so the baker is the culprit now. Yes, I saw him run away with it, I think, and... It's not my fault! - The Hundreth Sensor. Where did she go? Weird kid. - Oh, I like her. Nilou? - Eh, Lilith. Lola? -Li... Leander? I don't know. I don't trust it. There's something wrong. Maybe it's just a phase. I know Lilith. I know her different moods. This is something else. I have a bad feeling about this. I have to see her. You're not going to pack your bags every time she doesn't answer her phone. What about our work? They just started hatching. I have to see her. Now. If I leave now, I could arrive the next morning. I just need to know what's going on. It doesn't feel right. But how are we going to do it with the ... Don't worry. I will be back before they realise that their second Kakapo mum has gone. Can you please hold the fort here for a few days? Honestly? Actually, not at- SYLVIA SHADOW LIGHT Kasper? Margot? TO MOM Mama? I MISS YOU, XXX MOM No! Not good enough. No. Don't put me in the beginner's groep. Nee! Jimmy did not pee his pants. That's not true. This isn't normal. THE GHASTLY BROTHERS Between Getaleria Guisseppe and... YELLOW PAGES They're playing The Handthing on TV. Still waters run deep. STILL WATERS RUN DEEP. BUT NOT FOR LONG But not for long. The Handthing! - A city in turmoil. A CITY IN TURMOIL A gigantic hand? A GIRL LIKE NO OTHER You're pulling my leg. Here, Brabo. Have a sandwich. This is getting out of hand! TERRIFYING HORROR This time, I won't turn a blind eye. Hans! Take a seat. Grab your notebook and let's jot down all the mistakes. Not now, Walt. I'm making a new Sensor. Hans. Handthing. No. Hans. - No. Hans. - No. Hans. - No. Handthing. - No. Hans. - No. Handthing. - No. Hans! -No! We just lost our Sixth Sensor! I'm gonna start watching. Can you at least turn it down? As if you need popped corn. Did you check the fridge? THE HANDTHING A mini human. Lola! -Hey. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at school? I've seen more of them. We believe in something called working hours. Please come back tomorrow. But, wait! Where's your brother? - Hey! Hans! Hans! Hans! Hans! Hans! Hey. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be home? I don't have a home. Doesn't matter. I've seen more of those monsters. With a lot of the kids at school. - Who would like some hot coco? I think they're demons. - Demons? Yes. - Or some crisps? Could you please listen? Saint Raimi is filled with demons. Look, I've seen them. I saw them with this. - Do you leave that lying around? But it was broken. - Yeah but...even then! It works now. It was broken. And I fixed it. - It's true. It has been patched up somewhat amateurishly. Lenses are still clairvoyant. It does work. - So can you finally just listen to me? How bizar. How very bizar. We dealt with a lot of house spirits, possessed items. And demons? Wait, so you never actually caught a demon? Every ghost is different and therefore needs a different approach. Exactly! just a few days ago we were face to face with a Poldergeist from Gravelton. Wait for me! Here it is. Everything we know about demons. But all the pages are empty. No need to rub it in. To answer your question. No. We never caught an actual demon. But ... You saw demons at your school. So, tell us. I saw these weird creatures at school with many of the kids. I saw them with your goggles. Interesting. What is their reason for existence. Noticed anything special with your friends? Kasper has many stressy headaches. Something with emotions. And Jimmy, he's something else. Jimmy is the one with the ... Yup. Wait, what do you guys actually know about demons? Not much. Only that they're not housebound but personbound. Do they look like this? Sure. Allthough they all look a bit different. Are there any ghosts here? Lots! Everywhere. But don't worry. They're pretty harmless. Allthough they sometimes like to tease. And they just float around freely? Look. We would love to be an official ghost orphanage for lost souls.. But we dont have the space. Or else everyone will want to get rid of their ghosts and dump them here. So we tell every customer: Every pot needs a lid. And every house needs a ghost. - A little white lie. But don't tell anyone. - No. Shh. - Shh. Try not to lose your head next time. Mom. Who's that? Nobody. Who would like some more hot coco? Or some crisps? She has a demon. - No, join me! Walt will join me! - She has a demon. Grab some crisps! - But she has a demon. Don't touch anything! - But make yourself at home. Yup. Finally, a demon! And even inside our living room. Why would she keep this a secret? A Snatcher! No, wait. A Klingon! something that grabs on to its victim with sharp claws. A Grabghost. - Not now, Walt. We need to help her. - I know... They appear when the kids feel bad, right? She said something about feelings. - They are... FeelingGhouls. - Not now, Walt. You're right. It's missing something. - Let me guess, the right nomenclature? Exactly. There are many demons at her school. Many demons in the same place. No time to dawdle, Hans. We grab Laila, head back to that school. She shows us the demons. And I fill my book. It's Lilith. Li-Lith. No time to be a know-it-all, Hans. We need to go! No time for coco, Leslie. We need to get to your school. Because we're gonna catch us some demons! Where's my book? Maybe grab a cookie for on the way? Sensimonsters! Are you serious, Walt? Now? You're right. It still lacks something. But we're close. Emons! - What? I got it! Emons! That's perfect. Emotional demons. Emons! It's not bad. - That name has everything. And without a name, you only have chaos. Well done Lassie. I wouldnt have come up with a better name. No, absolutely not. Never. Let's go catch some Emons! Don't be a Ghost Rider, eh Walt? That's a good one. Where's my book? Don't you start too, Lilith. Do you have another Sixth Sensor? Crazy? I'm glad I've got one that works. - How are we gonna find all the Emons? There's lots of them, and they can hide very well. Liezelot has a point. Wait, Walt? - Yeah? Pandemonium? - Pandemonium ... Hans, are you out of your mind? Do you remember last time? We should never ever do this again! Maybe we should try it again? - What's a Pandemonium? O boy. Can't wait to fire this one up. If we play the right notes, and only IF, we would ... Theres a rift between our world and the demonic world. If we play a dissonant resonance, we give the demons a temporary invitation to our world. For like an hour or so. 66 minutes and 6 seconds to be exact. A second more and the gates would be open forever. We just give them a small nudge towards our existence. How hard is that nudge? Meh. Okay. No mistakes this time, Hans! - Nope. Yes! Wait. If we can see the Emons. Without the Sixth Sensor, then... Everyone can see them. Uh oh. Ah, feels just like home. Smells like teenage angst. Out of the way! - Jimmy? Look, another Emon. You said Emon. That means it's working. Come, Hans. Time to catch some Emons! Well, it has a ring to it. Ouch. Ah. Ah. Aah! I've brought food, little snails. Look! Oscargot? I feel a bit weird. I am a bit weird. Thanks. WELCOME Hans? Walt? Kasper? Margot? Ouch. Sorry, miss. - Excuse me. Can you help me? I'm looking for my daughter Lilith. Laura? - No, Lilith. Lilith? I stick my nose into everyones business Lilith? "I fix something and brag about it" Lilith? Yes, that's my Lilith. Where is she? She's been ignoring me. Im trying to reach her on the phone but of course she never picks up. Typical Lily, always angry when it doesnt go her way. Her stubborn attitude can really bring her into trouble sometimes and Im getting ... Mom? Lilith! Why didn't you say anything? I was worried sick! Leave me alone. - Lily, Lilith? Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Just go away! Lilith? Im sorry Maam, we didnt know Lilith had a mother. Excuse me? - She said she didn't have a home. I dont have a home and I definitely dont have a mother! My mom knows I hate blueberries. My mom doesnt forget my birthday. But I called you. My mom doesn't send me away. Lily, I had no choice! I ... At least my mom loves me. What the hell are you writing down? - Start small ... ... but grow bigger. Lily? Sweetheart? I'm here for you. Sweetheart, I love you. But I also love my job and I need to do something for myself. Something I'm good at. But why did you leave me here? Away from our home. Not that it matters, because the house is empy. I don't even have a home. Why are you saying that? I had no choice. Dont you understand? Do you think I like the fact that that damn bird lives on the other side of the world. At the furthest point imaginable? Don't you think that I have felt felt alone? Miles away from you. From the person that I love the most on this planet? Why didnt you say so? I tried, multiple times! In many ways. But you, stubborn as always. You never listened. You kept pushing me away! Okay, I get it Walt, you love naming things. But we need to save Lilith from her Emon. Even in fairytales, names are important. "Nobody knows, nobody knows. my name is Rumpelstiltskin." But..we cant just shout random names at the Emon. We dont know its name. Emon, Devil. Begone! Abalam, Abraxas! Beëlzebub! Balthazar! Voldemort? Gozer! Try Hastur. Hastur, I damn you! No, nothing. Kaluga, Mephisto! What in Gods name are you doing? If you know the name of a demon you take away its powers! Lily. Im sorry I make mistakes. You dont deserve that. The birthday thing, I screwed up there. I shouldve handled that better. Sweetheart. You mean everything to me. I dont care about anything else. It hurts me to see you fighting against me. I dont want to lose you, Lilith. Please. I never left you and I never will. I'm scared, mom. Shh. Don't be afraid. I'm here. How sure are you? How sure are you that you will always be there for me. If it depends on me. Always. Every time you leave, I'm afraid you would never come back. That I suddenly wouldnt mean anything to you. That you would suddenly vanish, without a trace. I would be devastated. Listen, Lily. I want to tell you so much that I would never leave you. That I would always be there for you. But I would be lying if I said that it was also possible, because we simply can't know. Sometimes. Sometimes life pushes us into a direction we don't want. Just like with Dad. You know that. We went through all that together, remember? But everything I do. Every decision I make is because I want only the best for you. But you have to help me , Lily. You're going to have to trust me. Can you do that? Can you trust me? I trust you. Come here, my little Shadowlight. I knew it. Name the monster, name the emon. Talk about the problem! We havent properly introduced ourselves. We are the Ghastly Brothers. Ghost hunters extraordinaire. - And Emon fighters. Exactly! One Emon down. Now the rest. Let's go, Hans! Way to go, Lilith! You're coming with us, right? -Me? We could use your expertise. If it's okay with Madam? It's okay. Go on. Hey Kasper. I've got two people here who want to see you. Kasper. - Kasper? Oh my god! - Kasper, are you okay? Margot. Are you there? Here I am! Here I am! Oh, wanna play a game? Lets play all of them at the same time! The Monopoly Settlers in Pursuit of a Clue! Mom, sorry about my A grades in math! But, an A grade. That's really good! Maybe you should create your own boardgame? Neato! And then we start our own snail circus. But I really can do better! Sorry. - No, Kasper. We're very proud of you. Think about every you need to make the game. Focus. Hocus..Focus! Bang! It needs to be fun. The more dice, the better. Theme? Snail circus! And you can play up to eight players! She's doing quite well. - Every snail has its own skill. The green snail is the easiest one. Just a bit of paranormal therapy. - Nothing more than normal. You are the most important. Not those books. Absolutely. We're proud of you. Whereby she says:" Well if they can't eat bread. Let them eat cake!" But the people were ... Jimmy, let the beast go! Out of my way. Come, now. Don't be late. So how long are we supposed to do this? As long as it takes. THE GHASTLY BROTHERS GHOST HUNTERS So, how are the Kakapo's doing? Are they allowed outside yet? Well, theres one who wants to leave the nest a bit too early. So weve got an extra eye on that one. Robin wants to present them to the sponsors next week. But before thats possible we still need a lot of work. Leaving the nest? Dont know much about that. No. Anyway, have to get back to work. Bye! Lily, I love your little PTA meeting. But as long as were doing the babysitting, you gotta get your hands dirty. My boxing gloves arent doing anything against the Poundergeist. So youre just trying to beat up this ghost? Sure. Beats me. Do you guys always do it like this? Step two is step two. Never change a winning formula. And how would you handle it? Little Miss Professor PHD Emon Expert 2.0? Ghosts and Emons arent the same thing. Is it? Hello Poundergeist. What's your actual name? Hello, Roarrrr, we need to talk.
