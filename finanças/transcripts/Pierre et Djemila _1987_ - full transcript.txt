Tell me the night Tell me the wind Tell me the story of two children Their mere 15 years, and their armors In a time of hate In a time of abuse. They dreamt of the sea beyond the walls Tell me the night Tell me the wind Tell me the story of two children Their mouths sang their adolescence And their sea-blue eyes burned the silence With absolute love and tender carelessness No fear in the heart, innocence in the face, A soul shared in the hands, and insolence in the lips Their souls fuse together when darkness falls Tell me the night Tell me the wind Tell me the story of two children No more time to cry for them They've lost their hearts in love. Pick up your things. Put your papers on my table. - Hi, dad. - What's up? - Look at the plan of our new apartment. - I'll be back in a minute. Pierre, are you coming? And why move? Your mother can't stand this neighborhood. She wants to live somewhere more pleasant. - We're fine here. - We'll have a bigger apartment. In the heart of downtown. It'll be better than here. Well, I'll say no more. Dad, you still agree to give me half the money for the motorbike? Of course, I've told you. Good afternoon, dad. - Ask your sister if she'd like to move. - Oh, but yes! Don't start arguing! Clear the table, we're having dinner. That's good. That's it. That's good. In the case of this triangle I drew, M is the midpoint of AB. So, N is the midpoint of AC. In an ABC triangle, the line parallel to BC which goes by the midpoint M of AB crosses the side AC in its midpoint N. I'll say it again. Write it down. "In an ABC triangle, the line parallel to BC which crosses the side AC..." You're doing groceries? - Yes. - Me too. - Am I bothering you? - No. I've been meaning to talk to you for a while. What's your name? - Djemila. - I'm Pierre. I must hurry back home. - I want a yogurt! - Later. I want it now! Come, dad is opening uncle Lakhdar's gift box! There will be figs and dates! And a big packet of nuts for dad! Don't touch it, Kader. It's nuts. Wait... - A desert rose. - Will you give it to me? It's for your mother. May God protect your brother! Uncle Lakhdar is kind. For Djemila. It's a beautiful gift. It's beautiful. I'll put it on. It suits you well. - Isn't it a bit long? - It's how it is at home. - Do you wear heels with it? - Sometimes, for parties. Did you have one, when you were young in Algeria? Yes, when I married. Then, I gave it to my sister, when she also married. Those dresses are expensive, you know? When does uncle Lakhdar come? This summer. It's been a while since he last visited us. You must have been 11 or 12. He sent a beautiful dress for Djemila. Djemila is a woman now. Is he wealthy? Yes... When you'll be doing your military service in Algeria, you'll be able to meet the entire family. It's good, Djaffar, that you wish to return to your country! I don't like living in France. I want to be a real Algerian. I know, my son. - How are you? - Good. - May I walk with you? - Yes, but we cannot be seen together. - We'll make a detour. - If you wish. - I've known you for a while. - Me too. - You have a sister, don't you? - Yes, she's in your school. Come, I'll show you the motorbike I want to buy. - Have you ever rode a motorbike? - Once. - Did you like it? - Oh, yes! It's the white one. I like the red and black one better. Would you come with me? We'll go for a stroll. Would you? If I'm allowed. - Your parents don't let you go out? - Not so much. - They're strict? - Mostly my brother. - Why your brother? - He's the eldest child. - I'd like to see you again. How? - I don't know. - Next saturday, maybe? - I don't know. I'll wait for you at 2pm at the bike store. And if I can't come? - I'll look for you after school. - Alright. I must go back now. Goodbye. Djemila! Are you buying groceries tomorrow or after tomorrow? Yes, maybe. The prayer. What a world, where we see this! One of these days they'll build a minaret there. There are more of them than last time. If someone had told me I'd live to see this... Did we ask anyone before building churches in Algeria? Listen, brothers... You've chosen me as imam. It's a great honor. The youngsters should take care of cleaning the mosque... and of surveillance. We need a muezzin... This would create problems. We already have problems. I'll be muezzin! - And I'll take care of surveillance. - Me too. Me too! Don't get into any trouble! No... but we'll watch. Attention, Djaffar... It's not up to us to police. What's important is the behavior of our children. We must bring in as many believers as possible. - Where do you go for vacations? - I stay here. I have to go to Corsica. But if you stay here, I won't go. Let's go down there? When school's over, it'll be easier to see each other. Except if my brother is watching me. - He works. - Not in August. - You want ice cream? - Yes. - What do you want? - A cone. Two cones, please. - How much is it? - 12 francs. Thank you. Thank you. Clear your things, we're eating. Keltoum, go get glasses in the kitchen. - You're still wearing jeans? - Yes, why? - You are like all the other girls. - It's more practical. Next week, when uncle Akhdar's here, there'll be no more jeans. You'll pick him up with the car? You'd rather my brother take a bus?! Dinner's ready. Djemila, pass me your father's plate. We must warn the director that Djemila is quitting school. You think she'll like it in Algeria? Exactly, she must return with Lakhdar to acclimatize before her marriage. She's such a good student... May she rather be a good wife! At least, she stays in the family. Of course! I wouldn't like my daughters following the example of the French girls. Turn your head. C'mon, smile! I'll use the timer. I want a picture of us both. - Wanna go to the sea someday? - It's far. By motorbike, about an hour. I'd love to go to the sea with you. I'd also love to go to the sea with you. Djemila... Pierre... It would be nice if we could spend a whole day together. Yes, it would be nice. Is it true what Munir says? You're doing military service in Algeria? - Yes, it's true. So what? - You're crazy! - They'll drag you to the Sahara. - Great. Enough, Djaffar. I went to Algeria last year. It's hell. You don't speak Arabic, you'll get fucked. I do speak Arabic. You'll see. Even if you're like them, you'll get fucked. And there's nothing to eat. I don't give a damn. I'd rather have a hard time at home than stay here. It's a matter of dignity. - You're like us, born in France. - That's not the problem. I'm Arab. I'm proud of being an Algerian. I'll serve in the Sahara. I'll sweat less than in this fucking country. Take it easy, Djaffar. When you're there, you'll understand. It's hell, I tell you. I'll do my service here, easy. - With the French. - Of course. - And you? - Me too. Bravo. You'll be good little Frenchies. "Liberty, equality, fraternity". Shit, man! I'll tell you something, French or not: That won't stop you from being called wogs all your life. You're stupid enough for that. Come, we leave now. Djaffar, that's enough! Are you crazy? I can't stand your Algeria. Go to Sahara! Who do you think you are? For what I am. An Algerian. For now, you're but an Algerian immigrant. - You too are a wog! - Take back what you said! Let it go, Djaffar. - Don't forget to reset at zero. - Yes. Here he is! - Had a good trip? - Excellent! Here's Kader. Hamdi, go fetch your parents. Djemila, sit here by my side. Lakhdar, you think France has changed? I'd forgotten it was so green. It's normal. It rains everyday. You need to go back home. You too look pale, like the French! You, my brother, have a nice tan. And you, Djemila? Do you wish to live by the sun? - I don't know. - "I don't know"! - Don't you wish to go to Algeria? - Yes, on vacation. What do you mean, "on vacation"? - You speak like the French, now? - I don't know. We must put Nordine to bed. Are you coming? Just a moment. Dinner will be ready in 5 minutes! - Bye, dad! - Pierre, wait a second. I want to know something. The girl with you, in the picture you hung in your room... - She's an Arab? - Yes, why? - Are you dating? - Yes. - Her parents know about it? - No. You know, Pierre... The Arabs don't like their daughters dating frenchmen. I know, but Djemila is different. She's born here, doesn't speak Arabic. She's as French as you and me. This is what you say. Ask her parents if she's French or Algerian. - You'll see what they'll say. - And so what? So, it may cause problems. The Arabs aren't like us. What do you mean? Well, it's just that they're Arabs and we're French. It doesn't mean the French are better than the Arabs, no! There are as many assholes among them as among us. - That's not the problem. - What's the problem? They don't see things as we do. And that's normal. They have their ways, we have ours. You've seen it. They built their mosque. I got to know them well during the Algerian War. I always thought it was stupid, turning them into Frenchmen. Dad, the Algerian War ended 25 years ago... You do as you wish, Pierre. But listen carefully: We don't do with the Algerians what we do with the French girls. For them, some things are sacred. But this doesn't stop me from finding her very cute. See you tonight. - Aicha isn't with you? - She leaves in one hour. I'm gonna buy something for us to eat. Come. - Wanna dance? - I can't dance. Doesn't matter, me neither. Two fries, please. - How much? - 12 francs, Mr. Thank you. - Do you still wanna dance? - Oh, no. - Let's go? - If you wish. I love you, Djemila. I love you too. Come here! Where are you coming from? Where were you? - Answer me! - With a friend. Who were you with? - With a friend. - Who? What's his name? Answer me! - Pierre Landry. - A Frenchman! Yes. You little whore. If uncle Lakhdar knew of this... What were you doing with him? We were dancing. Djaffar Khodja's sister spending the night with a Frenchman... Do you realize? He's from this neighborhood? Yes. Now go to bed, we'll settle that tomorrow. Aicha. Aicha. - What's going on? - It's Djaffar. - Did he hit you? - Yes. It's nothing. Can you send a message to Pierre tomorrow, at the school? - How? - I'll explain. Alright. Did he hurt you? I don't care. - Take it, it's from Djemila. - Thanks. We cannot see each other for a while. - For a long time? - Enough for my brother to calm down. Your brother is really crazy. Now, he watches me too much. I can't do anything. - Do your parents know? - No, he didn't say anything. When it gets better, I'll message you through Aisha. I must go, now. - It's you dating my sister? - Who's your sister? - Djemila Khodja. - Yes, it's me. - I'm asking you to leave her alone. - I'm not taking orders. - I don't like you dating my sister. - Did you ask her? She's Algerian, you're French. I owe you no explanations. What are you doing here then? Bog off! - Don't talk like that. - You don't. Listen. If you keep seeing my sister, it'll end badly. You've been warned. Go away! Djaffar, they vandalized the mosque. - Who? - The French. The French did this! DEATH TO THE ARABS They're after you this badly? If you lived among them, you'd understand, my brother. - You warned the police? - Not yet. - They won't come for this. - We'll be the police ourselves! Calm down, son. Let's not make this worse. We're sorry for this, Sir. Some of us are not assholes. We know that, Sir. Thank you so much. They should be ashamed of themselves. Meanwhile, they'd better keep quiet! Because if they go on, it'll end badly. Calm down, Djaffar. Let's go home. - I have 4 flat tires. - Me too, all 4. It will cost me at least 2,000. - What happened? - All the tires are burst. Oh, the bastards! Well deserved! If you weren't at the mosque, this wouldn't have happened. Screw the mosque! I'm on no one's side. If someone touches my car, I'll set them on fire! May God protect you, Ali. You'll be better off with us. Listen. We can't do anything illegal, or it'll backfire on us. So what must we do? We can't go on like this. This has been going on for years. The more it goes on, the more it's like we live in a kasbah! Today, it's the mosque... Tomorrow, they'll cut sheeps' throats in the yard. And we'll let them screw up our cars?! We're in France, for fuck's sake! You're right, Mr. Guérin. This is getting impossible. I don't even let my kids go out after dinner. Just last week I had problems with my daughters. Their daughters don't go out. Let's be fair, Mrs. Tremois... Our children are no saints. But at least they're among themselves. - So, what do we decide? - We'll set up a tenants association and meet mayor, to show them we won't be kicked out. Meanwhile, let's organize a night watch. What do you think, Mr. Landry? I agree. Provided it also serves to prevent shit from happening. After things like this mosque raid, we're sure to get some fight. Anyway, it's not your problem. You're moving, aren't you? Yes, in 3 months. Unfortunately, not everyone can do the same. I know, Mrs. Tremois. I was asked to come here, and here I am. I've said what I think. It's your daughter, your decision. Lakhdar, your son is virtuous. I'll give him Djemila. I'm happy, Ahmed. Your daughter pleases me very much. When will you take her? After her classes are over. For the marriage, we'll wait until she's 16, while she gets used to the country. Do as it suits you. - Djemila. - Mom. Why didn't you say anything? You let them marry me. I couldn't do anything, my child. Understand me. Tell them you don't want me to marry. Everything's settled, Djemila. I don't want to marry. Not now. You'll only marry 2 years from now. 2 or 10 years from now, I don't want to marry in Algeria. With a man I've never seen. In a country I don't even know. I didn't know your father when we got married. I've always been very happy with him. And also, Algeria is our country. Not mine. I'm very well in France. You and dad only meet Arabs. I have many French friends at school. You, you only talk about Algeria. And to marry me! I go to the door. It's Houria. - She's still crying? - Yes, it breaks my heart. What did you expect? We also had our tears... Yes, but we weren't born here. Come and give her a kiss. Houria came to give you a kiss. Don't cry, Djemila. You're lucky to find at home a wealthy family. You'll come to visit us here with your husband. I don't want a husband. She worries me very much. We must be patient. It's better a few days of tears... than her being doomed here. See? I can't even understand what you're saying. Pierre, something terrible has happened to me. My parents have decided to send me to Algeria once school is over. That's why my uncle Lakhdar came. They want me to marry his son. I can't stop crying. I'm lost, Pierre. I don't understand what's happening to me. I'm 14. I don't want to marry. I don't want to leave. I don't understand anything about this story. They're my parents. I love them. But I'm not like them. I want to stay here. With you. I want to go on studying. Pierre... I suffer so much... It's so awful... What's happening to me? I don't understand anymore. I cry nonstop. I must see you. Can you come Tuesday, 6pm? Where we usually meet. I don't want to leave you, Pierre. I love you so much. I could never live without you. Pierre... Help me. I love you. Djaffar, go fetch your sister. - Djemila, we're waiting for you. - I'm not hungry. Come, or uncle will wonder what's going on. Well, I go. You know, during my military service, I'll come see you during my leaves. I'll take you to Algiers. As you wish. So, Djemila, aren't you hungry? Yes, but I was finishing my homework. That's good, my daughter. Pass me your plate, Djemila. School's over this week, aren't you happy? Yes, my uncle. Pierre, I can't leave you. I can't leave you either. What will happen to me, Pierre? Come. - I don't want to go to Algeria. - When will he take you? Next week. They've decided everything. I will go and see them. It won't do any good. They wouldn't even listen. You won't go. I won't let it happen. - You can't. - I'll talk to them. I don't want it. There's nothing to be done. Pierre, I want to see you again before I go. Djemila... You won't go. I'll go to bed. - You don't want coffee? - No. Go heat the coffee, Carol. Pierre worries me. I said this couldn't end well. I've never seen him like this. Marrying a 14 year girl, that's unbelievable. Imagine Carol, 2 years from now? Christiane, you can't think like that. For the Arabs, marrying a 14 year old girl is normal. For them, she's a woman. - Have you put your books on the table? - Yes. Check if there isn't any missing. If you've forgotten any, you can bring it tomorrow or the day after. You can leave, now. - Have a good vacation, everyone! - Good vacation, Ms.! Goodbye, Ms. Goodbye, Djemila. Goodbye, Ms. Wanna go for a swim? I don't know how to swim, and it's freezing. What do we do? Wanna go to the lighthouse? - Can we? - Yes, I think. - Or we may go for a boat ride. - Yes. Djemila, you can't go back to your house. Let's run away, the two of us. It's impossible. My brother will find us. He won't. We'll go far away. I'll work. I'll manage. No one will ever find us. Djemila, you won't let them take you to Algeria? They've arranged everything. We can't do anything. I'm Algerian, Pierre. Pierre, I want to stay with you. It's over, we won't see each other anymore. I don't want to marry. I love only you, Pierre. Pierre! Pierre... Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. He stabbed him! Come. - It's your son. - Where's he? - In the mosque. - Have you called the police? Lakhdar, you wait for them. I'll find him. What have you done, my son? Forgive me, father. You must surrender to the police. Yes... Is he dead? He is dead. I don't know what took over me... May God protect you, my son. - Where is this mosque? - I'll show you, chief. Subtitles by maximer and gfcarvalho
