(Eerie Music) don't you understand? i want to end this just as much as you do i have a report here! it confirms your association with michael rowland he visited your home on april 7th. what does that prove? it proves you lied all along that's what it proves mr weston i didn't even know there was an organization until until michael roland got you involved now we're making some progress for once (Eerie Music) (Coughing) (Dramatic Music) I remember... i remember you as if it were yesterday i remember the promenade and the cool warmth of that summer's night you flaunted yourself i can still hear you laugh i laughed too now i decay all these things are bound up inside me i have to let them out before i go insane insane? i wonder if i am not i see them shadows they aren't merely nightmares what do they want from me? why me? at first i thought they were interested in classified information but not anything it doesn't really matter time here has stopped still i don't know what year it is all i know is that it has been an eternity since i last saw it breathe the air around i tell them i know nothing i tell them i don't care about politics and all the wretchedness that goes with it that they won't listen to believe make him believe still there's been a mistake a mistake (Large Door Closes) lloyd lloyd armstrong tom tom weston from general research that's the division right i remember now been a few years i guess it's useless to ask what happened to you i am as much in the dark as you are how long have you been here six hours when these clowns bust in i was in the middle of a poker game well anyway they bust in armed with the teeth said it was a raid what have we done tom we haven't done anything nothing they wouldn't have done in our positions that's what they want isn't it to be in our position what do you make of him i'm afraid there's not much to make that's what i mean there's only a couple of them 20 of us maybe he likes what we're saying maybe he'd like to take part in the riot we're planning sure you help us out we'll go real easy on you come the revolution i've been no certain this god for taking hold where the hell are we anyway explanations will be in order shortly a few days ago i wouldn't believed i'd be standing in front of such a distinguished group please i know that most of you think this is merely a game and that someone will eventually come up to you and say abracadabra this has been a practical joke well i'm afraid that isn't so reality is a trifle more cruel than that gentleman this is a modern world whether you like it or not now there's no need to worry we don't treat our adversaries the way you did all i want to know is what i have to do to get out of here you'll find it's not a matter of doing but being but hasn't that always been the case punishment in the name of rehabilitation you champs have always been able to avoid this sort of thing up until now but unfortunately for you things have changed haven't they no judges to bribe no team of lawyers to hire gentlemen welcome to tomorrow your trials were all played out yesterday your guilt is one of the foundations of our new order you find it boring with your crimes against humanity i don't know about anybody else but i find my crimes a source of personal satisfaction the way you tell it it's no fun at all gentlemen what i'm trying to do i don't care what you're trying to do what i want to know is what we're guilty of what about our families is there guilt automatic oh by the way before you're shown to your quarters each one of you will be issued a personnel number we want you to use it at all times there's a new world out there and we want you to act accordingly answer my question in due time 1170 prisoner 984 sir sit down 984 my name is weston i said sit down nine eight for four sake jeffrey release him but sir i'm only going to play this jailer nonsense so far release him my apologies mr weston the official protocol the numbers the handcuffs the uniforms and all it gets a bit silly doesn't it oh come off it i beg your pardon standard interrogation technique treat him with kindness and an attentive ear and you'll hand over the information without much bother you have information mr weston no but you're acting as if i do oh please don't worry mr weston will not have to break you at least not just yet dr fontaine himself asked me to look out for you fontaine yes he remembers you from his term at the university look warden why am i here surely you realize there's been a misunderstanding oh there's been no misunderstanding just answer the questions did you not find dr fontan's lectures interesting once you start programming people pretty soon you can't tell them apart from the machines i see you don't quite understand the movement why don't you believe me warden this is all a mistake i've done nothing but you are thomas r weston of uh 14 evermore drive yes but i had your best friend was michael roland michael romero oh come now you're not going to tell me that you don't know michael roland no yes i mean yes i of course i know him i just don't see how this is i can tell from your tone that roland hasn't done anything yet you remember michael roland himself asked me to look out for you there's been no misunderstanding just answer the questions answer the questions tom i'm gonna stop working soon when i finish uh about how long uh about an hour i wonder who that could be at this time of the night don't move i'll get it you keep working i need help screaming is tom come quickly it's michael he's been hurt come on got stuck in the rain don't be silly take it easy listen are you up to talking about this yeah i'm dave who did this to you a young zealot in whittaker's uh so-called communications group this is how they communicate well it's uh it's more the subject than the style thanks man i was uh i was at one of their meetings the usual thursday night get togethers what happened no matter what the problem was whitaker kept pointing the finger our way the sky's at the top so to speak so when whitaker suggested they all joined this movement led by dr fontaine i addressed him directly and called him a fraud suddenly i found myself being pummeled by this young hothead thanks margaret michaela i can't help but get the feeling that you think these people are a major threat to us all maybe they are tom if you'd come tonight you know what i mean there's so much resentment frustration i tell you tom i'm not going to stand for it much longer what are you going to do i'll let you know when i find out there are others who feel the same way as i do they feel the movement's going too far i better get home before sally starts to worry we'll take you home thanks margaret we need a man who needs me beyond politics who will get action on the issues that count we need braxton fontaine we need the movement we need a better tomorrow vote fontaine boat movement we are building a better world that's me that's ernie i don't know anything i swear plenty of time to get to the bottom of this how much do you think he knows it's quite likely he may know nothing it may be true nevertheless i want you to give him a full treatment a current situation is potentially explosive any additional information any will be vitally useful is it that serious doctor we're not playing games anymore anything can happen you do want to win don't you i'm not sure if it means well i do keeper 6 increase monitor function on prisoner 9 8 four are you okay all right look you seemed in rough shape yesterday what's the warden up to anyway he wants blood he doesn't seem to be convinced of my conversion he doesn't see how everything has come full circle he doesn't care if i don't know anything he only wants some confessions something like that 1170 is acting up again you must have really been out of it not to have heard him last night there's not much left of him he just screams about video screens and x-rays what do you think he sees they're taking 1170 away so lloyd good to see you again how they've been treating you numbers 1170 don't you follow the rules huh keeps the mind sharp you know what i mean ah damn i wonder how long we're gonna have to keep this up conditioning is good for you that's just it i think we're being conditioned in more ways than one all right you're not falling for the wardens rigmarole are you you do want to be free don't you yes and you have to believe in the new world come on lloyd you're putting me on i feel sorry for you 984 it seems you'll have a long tenure those who don't believe will eventually perish from their own horrific visions wait what's the matter with you you have been seeing visions haven't you i feel sorry for you 984 i sincerely hope you see the light louie what have they done to you prisoners assemble in the center of the yard all except you you're lucky you've been chosen they'll help you readjust 984 i got it all figured out do you hear me i hear you you got what all figured out the reason 1170 said all those crazy things last night and the reason they are putting him away why he mentioned something about the room a big room where they help you readjust what else what else i think he's seen the outside ah ah readjustment readjustment i want to change i want to i'm ready now take me take me to the warden take me then you'll regret you ever met me this is congratulations that little outburst over armstrong makes me think that you're coming along just fine where are you sympathy for the fool where is he he's a free man you can't bear the thought i've changed warden you know i have fine performance fine just fine you've been in jail all this time and you still play your games i was i want to tell you that i've stopped playing games well i think that would be a most unusual development don't you jeffries you think i can't remember the room sit down please please now go on what about the room i remember being left alone the exercise yard one day god knows how long ago i remember being led down a hallway by a guard and we entered in an elevator it went down down down i remember thinking to myself how huge this place must be what else do you remember you're bluffing western there was no room i think armstrong faked it now what do you remember nothing i tire of you no i swear there's nothing to remember i was only bluffing perhaps this will freshen your memory come on what else do you remember i remember thinking how big this place is this wasn't built just to hold prisoners was it please weston your memories you will find out how big it was later we entered a room there was a technician he strapped me into a chair you're on the right track now let's not wander my hands were gloved they must have been wired because i could feel a current what did you see nothing at first then there were pictures then what happened i looked at them and i received a shock to my hands what happened another picture was projected and came into the shop the next picture was with me there was no shock next picture was of a girl what was the girl's name i didn't say that charges conspiracy against dr fontaine again i don't know are you sure was the shaking what's shaking there was a tremor just silence and darkness and i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know and you don't remember anything else no good very good mr weston has a very very very vivid imagination wouldn't you say so jefferies well now that you've calmed down maybe we can continue do we really have to well i wouldn't want to inconvenience mr weston by dragging him off to his cell and then dragging him back again for our daily interrogation my god how many times do i have to tell you i'm innocent how many times until you feel it from within don't you miss the outside world don't you wish you could see your friends they're waiting for you out there don't you ever think about your wife or better still don't you ever think about your mistress my dear mr weston i'm sorry but there's no mistake no well i don't invent these figures i just analyzed them well i can't tell you what to do but i can suggest a few options based on the probabilities in the end you have to make the decisions okay bye-bye tom you haven't forgotten about the meeting have you no i haven't good good it'll be worth your while trust me i'll see you moment is then ladies and gentlemen and remember when you vote for action fontaine you not only vote for me what's the matter boys haven't had lunch well honey mr weston wouldn't by any chance like to join up sure show me the clubhouse i don't think i could stand the initiation you know i can't stand the taste of blood you'd take this very lightly but when the social balance tips in favor of the world steps in favor of the average man he will unite become the strongest individual the world has ever known i know spare me the quotations i read content but that's one of the weaker parts by the way surely together hello what are you doing i'm sitting in your car where can i let you off i said where can i let you up i heard you i'm going wherever you're going maybe i'm slow or something now correct me if i'm wrong but uh are you propositioning me of course not obscurity is politically incorrect it takes energy away from far more important things did you get that from the little manual you have there you should know you've read it you haven't changed much have you never afraid to say things people don't want to hear you on the other hand always say the expected it's always in the book stop it mr weston i expected that look if you're trying to shock me you're wasting your time what is she like other than possessive who are you talking about you would i'll say it again if you're trying to shock me look i've decided not to talk about it what are you trying to find out anyway don't you have all the answers in that little book there's still some questions i'm on the other side that's all you need to know but look see no uh electro's embedded in the skull no faint hum of hidden machinery nothing metallic to the skin i know what your hands feel like well well what well this is where you get out you seem preoccupied perhaps i hit a nerve face it ward it's not much different out there than it ever was what do you take me for some kind of an eccentric who's housed all of you here for over 10 years in order to generate a few maniacal thrills who do you think i am a mirage a stinking mirage on the country you're going to find i'm very real very real why don't you just kill me now once and for all no no no no no i simply want you to sign this confession what's this one say you admit to everything and i've done nothing now look weston someone has to take the blame for all this you've committed a crime a crime against all mankind renounce your past make it worthwhile please please believe me there's a better world outside a far better world sign you can be a part of it all you want there's a signature there you have it if you want something more this isn't the way to do it you're up to your old tricks again it's very funny you leave me no alternative but to introduce you to a new level of pain got to get to the bottom of this somehow you're taking this very calmly tom fontaine for this top secret mission you won't be disappointed i swear these people are really concerned they really are and they're willing to do something about it roland michael 8873-588 your friend thomas well i've got some important people coming this afternoon please be seated mr baxter you're in this surprise cloak and dagger never struck me as your style it isn't but circumstances dictate differently michael next item is for you roland things at our end are proceeding as planned those parts should be moving through your company sometimes how many uh 25 identification uh x-ray machine guys good no chance of uh an accident oh no they're not unfunctional and they'll stay that way until we get mr yamato's remote triggers uh i hate to break this up but what the hell are you people talking about oh haven't you i really had time mr weston uh tom as you are well aware i'm sure we face a crisis point with our illustrious mr fontaine having gained such incredible ground we see a move to disrupt uh the way things would be the way things ought to be this is strictly your opinion mr weston we speak for all civilized interests we must take action immediately uh before it's too late what kind of action well as you can see for yourself on the screen uh what we're talking about just now uh the minotaur uh familiar with the portable nuclear device still experimentalists at least as far as i thought you don't intend oh we don't intend to do anything unless it's absolutely necessary our governments seem reluctant to be involved which makes me question whom they really serve you know conflict of interest they don't want to be caught in embarrassing situation it's all it's all left up to us you people are kidding aren't you terrorism condoned by the government mr baxter you are joking but you weren't playing with toys you could inadvertently start something far worse than what you intend to stop reliable sources inside sources reports that dr fontaine and his starry-eyed followers are entertaining the same idea tom we're reasonable men we're prepared to negotiate but these people in the movement are not willing to step aside we don't want to let this thing get out of hand and that's where you come in we need a man we can trust now we have the equipment and the personnel but we need advice on the fine points oh yes like where to put the damn things or where they can be strategically placed to make the best impact where it can make the best impression you see western we want to end this damn thing before it begins why are you so sure i can be trusted your record speaks for itself and we have witnesses mr weston we are a determined group of individuals think about what this means huh but i suppose it was all in the line of duty don't misunderstand me i'm not completely naive i just can't figure out how you can move in a bunch of idiots like that i don't care about them i care about you okay a little more i just want to straighten things out between us let me straighten you up i happen to love my wife now return to reality and stop bouncing my mother sleep on it tom no need to make a hasty decision we can talk about it tomorrow i just want to say that nothing has changed tom is that what you want to tell me that you love me yes tom what has gotten into you i don't know i guess i thought this was the appropriate time to tell you what a fool i can be something you're a person you're allowed to make mistakes look i'm not perfect either but hey look that's not why we're together is it i mean because we thought we were perfect it's a crazy world tell them i'm busy no need to get up mr weston i don't believe i've had the pleasure mr uh back i'm the new head of the personnel division i've been instructed to inform you of the new regulations you see the company is undergoing some changes new regulations you're joking please leave now before i throw you out i sure will i came here to offer you the opportunity to make this work but you're taking it ever too lightly tomorrow you may regret this move who are you mary who is this man answer me dr fontaine's personnel manager call mr baxter for me he'll get to the bottom of this okay wake up wake up wake up i'm not finished with you not just yet wake up mr weston what's going to happen to me the same thing that happens to lloyd go to hell don't you understand i want to end this just as much as you do i have a report here it confirms your association with michael rowland he visited your home on april 7. what does that prove it proves you lied all along that's what it proves mr weston i didn't even know there was an organization until until michael roland got you involved now we're making some progress for once just to be fair perhaps we should invite your old friend mr roland to join our enlightening conversation and tell his side of the story mr roland well it can't be is it really you michael i'm so happy to see you have you seen margaret i can't believe it's you how is how is it on the outside are you happy is everyone happy michael tell him tell him i have nothing to do with the organization please mr roland i want you to tell the truth who committed the crime who instigated who destroyed who is the enemy i oh this is insane please tell them the truth i don't understand warden why is this happening to me what ugh me did you find anything a thumb lock is jammed in section two we'll have to find spare parts but where look warden shouldn't we tell weston about all this maybe we can find others and start all over again there are more important things to do than sitting around here beating him to death shut up we will not shirk our responsibilities if we do all this becomes meaningless is that all you brought me here copies of his latest entries good but it ends here look you can tell by the scratch marks on the papers run out of ink make a note to get him a new pen what are you looking for i'm waiting for the day that he admits admits to himself so you're certain that he committed crimes against the movement don't be a fool he didn't commit anything look at him he's frightened and confused lost the game and why continue to play because without the game what is there but a set of empty memories and dreams but sir we have won have we yes of course we have so why spoil the fun it's a real education watching a man like him rise to the challenge do you understand the challenge i'm not sure i do no of course you don't westin does he understands confessions denials torture i'm weary of the warden's limited repertoire he distorts the truth until reality becomes so twisted that one doubts every thought every memory i keep telling myself that i'm innocent but with each night come the nightmares and with each morning comes doubt how many more times are we going to rake through my past and then have him say i'm lying or hallucinating lies hallucinations truths they don't exist anymore i haven't the strength to play anymore all i want is to be with you alive in the world beyond these walls goodbye the bastard knew all along he knew we were one step ahead of him that's what kept him going it's over weston for all of us what do you mean you figure it out i'm not very good at explanations what's going on you'll do one of your tricks no no more tricks i promise the camera is broken you can't see us anymore if you want to make a break for it you better do it now watch out for the keepers he controls them he controls everything (Eerie Music) (Loudspeaker Announcements) (Dramatic Music) (Dramatic Music) (Room Hum) a free man. you can't bear the thought. you're lucky. you've been chosen. find out how big it was later (Dramatic Music) No he's taken this for too long 984, i've got it all figured out i think he's seen the outside (Crying) I've got it figured out coming home i'm coming home i'm coming home i'm coming home (Commotion) jeffries i have a great idea why don't we phone a couple of ladies and... don't be a fool you'll never survive please listen to me jeffrey i i didn't mean to i there was no other way he would have gone mad it was the humane thing to do jeffreys why don't we make some new tapes we'll have a parade tomorrow the men will like that. everyone loves a parade. (Marching Band Music) don't you miss the outside world my dear mr weston (Wind) (Dramatic Music)
