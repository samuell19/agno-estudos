ESCAPE FROM HELL Shit, it's raining! Take us back to our cells! The water feels good. You'll stink less afterwards. Blind was my mouse. Blind like my child. Crazy girl, stop! Or I'll burn your rag doll. Don't stop! Work! You're not fooling around! Damn torturers! This language will cost you an extra hour of work! Get up! Anne, what are you going to do? What you understood: run away. Alone you can't succeed! This is crazy! If they take you back, you know what to expect. Better to risk your life than to die slowly here. Stop! The jungle, it's a sure death! I don't have your stamina, Kate. If I were like the others, I would stay... but I can't take it anymore. Goodbye! Anne! Anne! Anne! Where are you from? Tell me where you come from? - I must not have digested the lobster. - Don't joke! Where did Anne go? I asked you a question! I don't know! - Anne is your friend. - They all are! If you are involved in her escape, you will wish you had never been born! I will make you regret it, be sure of it! And now, work. Work hard! Martinez, Anne is missing. She must have run away. Guards! Come with me quickly. - I'll take care of it. - I'll take care of it. You go that way, go! Us, that way. You're at the end of the road, Anne. Stop! Hold it, come on! Let me go, you bastards! This is the price for those who try to escape! - Stop moving! - Let go of me! Dirty pigs! You're a beast! Let go of me! Thief, yes. But not a whore! - I told you to stop that! - You fat slut! Bitch, you'll see! Scum! I'm going to slaughter you! Let me go so I can kill her! Get out of my way! Get off me! I want to kill her! I'll make you regret your words! I'm going to kill you! - You fat bitch! - That's enough now! Enough of this! Separate them! Calm down, for God's sake! Let's go! Get moving! Bitch! Will you shut up? All he does is drink and sleep. Doctor! Doctor, wake up. What? This morning, a prisoner escaped. A jaguar killed her before she could be recaptured. A jaguar? In this pouring rain? I am not the camp commander. You don't have to tell me that. Until the new commander arrives, you're the highest ranking. No one is high up in such a shitty place. Leave me alone. Move, move... You have to live. Don't worry. I just want to help you. Congratulations, warden. For a jailer... you have a tender heart. When it is necessary and only with those who need it. As long as it is animals and not human beings! Of course. Because animals have specific functions dictated by nature. And human beings are different? - Society has its laws. - Yes. And what laws! To treat us in a degrading way, worse than animals! Shitty laws! Enough is enough! Quiet! We have to get back on track, the prison is still a day away. Come on, let's get moving! The luggage. Come on, move it. Forward, march! - Come on, move it. - Quick, move it! Come on, move it. Let's go! Blind was my mouse. Blind as my child. Sleep... Sleep, my little one. - Quiet, all of you. We're sleeping! - Go to hell! You shut up too. It's late. Go to sleep! Fine... Sing your lullaby to me instead. Leave her alone. She's just a poor fool. Let's get out of here. Wolf! Wolf! My beautiful Wolf! My beautiful, are you here to keep me company? What do you want? Do you want me? Poor Anne. I shouldn't have let her go. It's not your fault. At least she won't suffer anymore. They say that the jaguar kills instantly. One bite, one sharp blow and goodbye to life. I don't believe this jaguar story. I know that dirty torturer. Whether or not the doctor believed that jaguar story or not, it doesn't matter. He's a drunk! It's more important that the the new director believes us, right? Don't you agree? - We have to welcome him. - How can we do that? With a musical parade? Come on, let's go! Come on. Let me feel your skin. Work hasn't ruined it for you. On the contrary... Stop it. - The new director? - Yes. Welcome, Commander. I'm the head custodian. This is Marika, an ex-convict converted to a and an excellent janitor. Take care of the new arrivals. - You! - Where are my quarters? - This way. - Gather your things and follow me. Come on, let's go! Let's go. This one is crazy. What is this music? Is this a prison or a concert? The doctor spends his days listening to classical music and drinking. I'm not interested in your opinion. I want to see it, I brought some medicine. Too much mess! Well... Good. Very good! Good. This place is fine. There's even a piano. Dust. You, bring me some water. - Who was that? - The handyman. Mute. - We have to put everything in order. - It will be done. Get out of here and don't show your face so dirty again! - And who is he? - The camp doctor. What's that? Is that Dr. Farrell? I was told that you like classical music. And I think you also like playing the piano. Interesting, don't you think? This is a hard labor camp. No time for distractions! The only distraction today, is your arrival. You have lost the dignity of your profession by showing up like this. How did you want me? In a bowler hat and a bow tie? No. But less soaked in alcohol. Don't ever disrespect me ever again! All right, everything will be clean as you wish. But you'll have to be on the inside too! The new director wants you to be clean. He's a hygiene freak, remember that! How wonderful! It's so hot! Wash yourself well, eh? Let's hurry up. Let's not waste too much water. That's enough now. Get out of there. Next! Give me the dice. Kate, this is the new one, who replaces Anne. I hope you like her and that she will console you. Keep each other company. - Did you arrive with the director? - Yes, I did. He's a very hard man. What's your name? - Vivienne. - Sit down. Let's play. It's my turn. Seven. This is your bed. - How long did you get? - 20 years. - Of course you're innocent. - No, I'm not! Long live honesty! Make a cross on your past life, it will help you to live in this hell. Let's get to the introductions. Mary, 20 years for murder. Zaira, another 18 years for theft. We have to keep each other company for a very long time. We like each other. We share everything. Kate is the leader of the cell. You are very cute. If you are nice to us, you'll feel good. That's enough! - I won't allow you to! - What's wrong with you? I'm the cell leader. I am the one who decides what belongs to everyone. Vivienne... is not shared. At least not right away. She will do what I tell her. Leave me alone! Listen, my beautiful, it's not you who will refuse me what I want. Don't touch me! I didn't want to go there. You made me do it. Where did you come from? - Paris. - Paris? The Champs Élysées, Montmartre... - I had a friend there once. - Stop it with your friends. Perpetuity is not enough to tell us about them all. It's my fault if I was asked? I hope you are satisfied. I shaved and put on a shirt. Is it all right? That was the minimum. Decency is part of the rules and I intend to enforce it. Do the rules also say to treat the inmates like slaves? I have to cut down three miles of jungle to get the northern road through. and I can't do that by being docile. Luis, what do you think? The work continues, the inmates don't seem to suffer. These women are exhausted, and for months they have been fed only roots and boiled snake. We have a doctor to get them back on their feet, Eating like we do would hurt them. They would become lazy and it would make them aggressive. Rather than a model camp, it would become hellish. I'm curious... Why are you eating with gloves on? I've been living in this kind of environment. The real danger, it's not the snakes that you can even find in your bed... nor even the big scorpions, but the microbes. In this kind of climate, everything is infected. Getting sick here means dying. You think you can avoid infection by wearing gloves? What about the rest? I understand what you mean. But I don't drink. I don't have any vices. Fingers in the plate? Get that out of my face! Put this horrible woman in a cell! Go away. Get out of here. Get out of here! You play the piano well. I used to. Please excuse me. I'm tired, I need to rest. Good night. Good night, Mr. Director. Good night, Mr. Director. Work is exhausting here. But with time, you get used to it. Thank you. Water carrier, I'm thirsty. - You want some too? - I can't resist. - That's what we all said. - Hey! Give me a drink. Thank you. Where are you going? What are you doing? I was looking for roots. It's not forbidden during the breaks. - An excuse. What is it for? - To fill my stomach. It's not necessary. If you are nice to us, you won't be hungry anymore. With everyone, except you! Are we rebelling, bitch? I don't want to! I don't want to! And I say that you're going to make us happy... The more you resist, the more we like you. You disgust me! Convincing argument, isn't it? Give in to our wishes or this beast will bite you. Come on! I don't feel like waiting. I don't want to wait! It's going to cost you. We'll make an example out of you. Your comrade will be whipped because she refused to return to work work after the break. Therefore, starting today, there will be no more breaks. If any of you fail, you will all have to pay. She will stay tied up until sunset. You must not use my music for your sadistic demonstrations. No sadism here: she is being punished for disobeying the guards. Take them back to their cells. Into your cells! All in your cells, quickly! Get moving! Into your cells! Come on, let's hurry! Come on, hurry up! Are you going to move your butt? All inside! Come on, let's go! Hurry up! I said I don't share it! Let go! You'll see! I... I'm going to kill you! I'm going to make you feel like it! They don't keep quiet even at night. Hurry up! Stop it! Both of you stop! - Get out of there! - Get off of me! - Move it! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Are you going to move? Hold still! These two prisoners have been punished for fighting. They made a mess of their cell and disturbed my sleep. My methods will nevertheless be more severe and much more drastic for those who will cause more problems. Whether it's on the job or on the camp. Am I clear? I hate to use the hard way, on principle, I would like to live in peace and without problems, but I have responsibilities. I demand order and obedience from all. As long as I am responsible for this work camp, it will be best for all not to do anything stupid, and complainno complaining. I forgot... When I arrived, I brought mail for some of you, that meager link that unites you to the civilized world. But given what happened this night, and just so you know that things are going to change, you will have to wait for for the mail to arrive again, assuming that there is any more. And now, let's get to work! - Move on. - Come on, move it! Shake it off! - Back to work, the party is over! - Hurry up! - Move it! Come on, let's go! - Faster! Come on, let's go! - Move it, move it! - Slowly! Congratulations. Your executioner's methods are perfect. A snake in the water! Come here! Be nice! She is also very beautiful up close, don't you think? Come on. Let's get to know each other better. Easy... Stay still! Leave me alone! Cowards! No! Let go of me! I don't want to! Cowards! Like this! Stop fussing! Come here... Come here! So much violence on this skin... so delicate. Juliette, my love... Finally! At last you've come back. Why did you leave me? You shouldn't have left me. You weren't supposed to. What about the children? Where are the children? You took them from me too. I have never stopped thinking of you and only you. I love you. We are finally together again. Together, you and me! I need you! I can't live without you and the children. The children... You, me and the children! The kids... You mustn't leave me anymore. Never again! Never again! You are my wife. You are my wife! Again... Why did you call me Juliette? My name is Vivienne. It was a hallucination. Best drink and forget. How is Vivienne? She's pretty shaken up, she has to stay in the infirmary. What's the point of these ointments? That's right. What's the point? An ointment is useless. What's the point of me treating you? If not for the others to slaughter you again. But you are a doctor! I thought doctors were different from torturers. But you are like them. You are not martyrs. You have also used violence. We can't take it anymore, we are treated worse than animals. And they use our bodies for their sadistic pleasures. And you don't do anything to prevent this. The world is a pigsty. And it's not me who would have the strength to clean it all up. In this pigsty, you run the risk that you'll get caught up in it too, Dr. Farrell, like all of us. I am a useless being who only knows how to snore and get drunk. Then you can throw away also your ointments too! Let's get moving. Hurry up and move. You two, quickly! Let's get moving! - Aren't you at work? - It's my turn in the kitchen. Come on. - What, Mary? - Can I get away for a moment? Go, go... You work too hard, Doctor. You should have some fun. Are you looking for an assistant among the prisoners? I don't need advice on how to spend my time. It was just a suggestion. I have a little bit of a fever. As a precaution, I came to get some quinine. Take three a day. Don't worry, you won't die. At least not because of this. I also need cotton and alcohol to disinfect my hands. Too bad you can only disinfect the outside. I don't like you, Farrell. I don't like you! Did you bring what you promised me? Alcohol and tobacco? I always keep my word. Now, it's your turn. Don't worry, I'm ready. I'd rather have you as a whore, rather than as a raped woman. Come closer. What's this? Where did you steal that? I didn't steal anything, it's mine! What's going on? She stole some alcohol and cigars. - It's not true! I swear it! - Quiet! - What's the matter? - She stole this. Did she? Well... 20 lashes. - Guards! - No! Hold it! Harder! Like this. And again! Enough of this! Enough of this! That's enough! Shove her in a hole outside the camp. Let's get moving. Come on, move it! Let's go! Come on, let's go! - Take it easy! - We're exhausted! The bastards! On the double! Get inside too. Faster! Faster, faster! - Is this really necessary? - Take care of your work. You cannot punish and kill at your whim! It was an act of rebellion and I do not allow it. My God! Don't try to release her, Doctor. You know very well that there are plenty ferocious beasts roaming around here. - It's a punishment. - It's not a punishment. It's a death sentence. In this camp, I am the law. Whether you like it or not. Blind was my mouse. Blind was my mouse. Like... Mary is dead. This is her replacement. Hurry up, come on! Get to work! Hurry up. Let's go! And you! Lift the earth on the other side. Shake it off, lazy girls! Faster! Come on, let's go! - What have you done to yourself? - I cut myself! Let me see. - Does it hurt? - A lot. Hurry up and go to work! I can't stand her anymore. To think that she was one of us. What are you up to? When I call, answer immediately or I'll assume you're plotting. - We didn't hear. - Vivienne got hurt. Show me. It's nothing! Don't make a fuss! - The cut is deep! - You can work. We need to get him to the infirmary. Be careful, I can have you whipped until you bleed. Are you sure? You won't do anything! Let go of my hand and I will pretend as if nothing had happened. You're just lying. We can read what you are on your monkey face! Let go of me! What are you going to do? - Get down! - No! Get down! Bitch! Get down! Get down! Drowned. In half a meter of water and a mouthful of mud? I really want to know who killed Marika! The culprit must be revealed, otherwise, you will all die! Every night, after work, you will be whipped. You will see that the name of the culprit will eventually come out. Luis, Martinez, start. All of you, go ahead! Get up! I'll teach you! Hurry up! Pigs! Damn cowards! I'll get out at the first opportunity. Nobody will be able to stop me. - Don't bullshit... - Let her talk. I'm the one who decides what we do here. I agree with Vivienne. I'll run away the first chance I get. Didn't you see what they did to the ones that tried? Mary and the other one died staying here. - Are you with me? - You can be sure. - What about you? - You're crazy. It's impossible to face the jungle without weapons, without food... This is pure stupidity! - There's the doctor! - The doctor? It's just a body full of alcohol. Even though it looks like the others, I guarantee you it's different. Why talk about the doctor? I don't like this at all. Do you want to continue getting whipped every night? No! But what can we do? I have an idea. Come with us too. Let's hear your idea. Help me! Guards! Quickly! Help! Help me! Guards, quickly! Help her! - What's wrong with her? - Stomach pains. She tried to resist, but she can't take it anymore. Very good. You two... Take her to the infirmary. Doctor! Wake up, someone is sick. - What happened to her? - I don't know. She's not feeling well. At this time? Go away, go away. What's up? What's wrong with you? Come here. What do you feel? Where do you... Are you in pain? - I don't have any pain. - Then what did you come here for? We decided to run away. Run away? To go where? That's suicide. And how would you do it? We won't stay here. Doctor, please, help us. - You'll never make it. - Exasperation can do anything. - Not in this case. - You have to help us escape. How can I help you with your absurd idea? I don't know, but you're the only one we can hold rely on. I can't do anything. I don't want to be an accomplice to the escape of criminals such as you. It was foolish to put all your hope on me. Drink too and forget. No! I want to live! We are not only criminals and women! We are human beings! And we want to live! Enough now! Calm down, be reasonable. She has to go back to work. What's wrong with her? I don't know yet. She threw up a funny liquid. Vomited? Yes, she vomited a reddish liquid. Maybe blood? What else? I still have to analyze it. Give me time. If you want to see, there's some left in the bowl. No, you're the doctor. I don't want to contaminate myself. Well, keep me posted. Do whatever it takes to avoid contamination. If it's possible. You know these tropical diseases, they spread easily and... - How did it go? - Good. Watch the grid. We have to take ten drops each. We'll feel really bad, we're gonna puke our guts out, but by the time we get past that, we'll be long gone. Our skin will be covered with red marks that we must not scratch. I don't care. The important thing is to get away. It's going to work. It's going to be okay. Drink up. Be brave. You'll see, everything will be fine. - Come on, drink. - Can we trust him? Of course we can. She knows the doctor well, doesn't she, Vivienne? Yes. Give it to him. Here you go. Drink up! Vivienne! Vivienne! What's wrong, crazy girl? I heard everything. Pass me those drops too. So you weren't crazy? Not at all. I faked it so I could survive this hell. The story with the dog was useful for me too. That way the guards didn't touch me, because I disgusted them. I want to come with you. Pass me the bottle. Here. Pass it to the other cell too. - We all agree. - All right. She feels bad too. Come on, turn around. What the hell, what the hell is wrong with you? - What's the matter? - The plague. The plague? Are you sure about that? And of a kind that attacks also attacks the lungs. Some are already contaminated and spit out drool and blood. Can the epidemic be stopped? Yes. Only a few cells are affected, but then... Take them somewhere else and have them disinfected! We have to get them away from here right away. - But we have to take care of them! - Here? And how? With what medicine? You want to cure the plague here? - We have to kill them! - Kill them? You are a criminal! Then take them away from here! There is a cabin beyond the jungle, you can stay there. Take all the medicine you can find with you. I can't risk an epidemic. They are in critical condition. I can't go through the jungle like this. We need equipment. Weapons, food... And I have no intention to risk my life too. You will have all that you ask for. I'm counting on it. Out, quickly. Come on, let's get moving. You too, out! Hurry up! Come on, shake it up! Cheer up, girls. I'll take care of you. There is everything you have ordered. You can take them now. - We're ready to go. - Good. - I could use that gun. - Yes... Take it. It's yours, here. Rifle and ammunition! These women are doing great! The only one who will die, is you! I kill you for their sake! Let's go. So far, so good. Cheer up. Yes. Let's not get lost! Let's stop here. Let's take a break. Let me see those buttons. Doctor, we trust you. You'll get us out of this. Let's hope we can do it. For you. - Think of your freedom and resist. - I will be strong. - Good. Who knows how to use a gun? - I do. I had an act in a circus with a partner where I had to shoot as close to him as possible. One day I hit him right in the face. But it wasn't an accident. I see. Use it for a better purpose this time. Fucking hell! Did you kill the director? Who did it? The doctor? In what way? You couldn't tell us right away, you idiot? The poison was probably something made up by the doctor. Bastard! You're going to pay. You're a coward! Be careful! Hurry up! Come on! Courage, it will soon be dark. You can rest. We'll leave at dawn. Doctor, my legs are shattered. I can't walk anymore. Spread this ointment on your wounds. I told you to do it. Why didn't you listen to me? It will ease the pain. Try to sleep now. You need to rest. Because tomorrow, at first light, we have to start walking again. It will be even harder than today. - Are you tired? - My head is spinning. I'm not nauseous anymore, but I'm still not well. But when I say to myself that this is my first night of freedom, it consoles me for all my past and future sufferings. Think of resting. Sleep on my shoulder. What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it! This is no time to argue! Stop it! Will you stop? Enough of this! You must be united and leave behind all personal grudges if you want to get out of this hell alive. I made a choice. I took the responsibility to keep you safe. You must do what I tell you to do! Or I will no longer be responsible for your lives. Tomorrow we'll be on the road again. - It's ruined. - There's nothing to do? Nothing. This poison is unforgiving. Stop it! - He finally found a lead. - Let's hope it's a good one. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go... Check it out! The remains of a fire. They slept here. They will not escape us. Let's go! They have found us! Put the stuff down quickly! We're heading for the swamp! Hurry up! Come on, let's go! Doctor, quickly! Let me through! Move aside. His heart has given out. Be careful! Leeches! Don't shout! Stay here. That's it... It's done. Cheer up. It's done. Good God! It's covered with it! What are you doing? Here you go, doctor! Here, hang on to this branch! Catch it! Squeeze hard. As hard as you can! Squeeze! They found us. Take cover! Kate! Get down! Flee, the river is near! I will take care of them. Go away! Go away! Doctor! Doctor... No, Doctor... - He's done for. - No, he's not! He's just hurt. We have to save him. We can't leave him like this. We can't waste time. The river is only a few steps away. Let's go. I don't agree. Even if I wear it alone. - I don't want to leave it. - Stop it... All right, as you wish. Cheer up.
