Not a finger. [Dragon] We've been treating her like JLo at the Ritz. -Ain't that right, baby? -Eat me. [Dragon chuckles] You thought that charm school hadn't paid off. Let's do this, Dragon.

I've tapped into this public access channel and I'm broadcasting to you from my home. All other stations appear to be off the air. Shit. That means I'm gonna miss the Ice Capades. I am an astrophysicist. That's good. Last night a solar flare occurred for over fifteen hours. It has apparently altered our atmosphere worldwide with some type of radiation. We lost consciousness. The majority who did not have become the inhuman monsters we have seen outside. These monsters feed on blood. Most appear to be insane animals acting on their most basic impulses. But we had a few who were actually calling out to us sounding rational, almost normal. The mutation therefore is varied. Varied? What the hell's that supposed to mean? If there are any of you out there, try to make it to my home in Santa Monica. We need to form a defense and there is safety in numbers. Come to Wilshire and Broadway. And bring guns. Lots of guns. This is my daughter Lisa. Homie's got a pretty white-looking daughter. - I shall continue repeating-- -He must have fucked an albino. -[man] Yeah, I fucked one-- -Yo, man, shut the fuck up and listen. - And God bless. - And don't forget the guns. [TV static] Shit don't make no sense. Why aren't we affected? I think I might know. Oh, yeah? Well, pig, I'm all ears to hear your expertise. That warehouse we were in was lead shielded. Lead? It's a storehouse for radiological pharmaceuticals. The feds enforce pretty strict regulations when it comes to housing that material. Well, it makes sense. So, we didn't get zapped by the solar flare, right? That would be my guess. [old man] Pretty good guess, son. Me, I went down deep in my basement, made of three-inch brick. Probably did the trick to protect my old ass. Damn, as if Compton wasn't bad enough, now we got to deal with this shit. Gets worse. What do you mean? Whatever that radiation was, it affects cars. [David] How's that? It just don't start. That's all. Could be an electrical thing. No, man, if that was the case, the TV wouldn't work. Man, now we ain't got no wheels? [man] I don't get something. These vampires or whatever the fuck they are, how come they're out in the day? Oh, shit, he's right. Nosferatu don't operate like that. [G-Dog] Man, will you stop with the Nosferatu bullshit? [David] And these things don't care about sunlight. [G-Dog] Yeah, Larson, they ain't movie vampires like Tom fucking Cruise. I don't know if they are vampires or if they're zombies or what, but the good news is-- The good news is we can take them out.

Yeah, something like that. [Monte] Lisa is my stepdaughter. Her mother died when she was little... Cancer. It's been just me and Lisa since then. Pretty well hold up here, Doc. For the time being. -It won't last. -How's that? The mutant population is growing. They seem to instinctively know where there are uncontaminated people, people like us. Mutants? I thought they were zombies. Oh, man, who cares what they are called. They are some bad motherfuckers. [Monte] Well put, young man. Well, he's going to be fine. [beeping] What is that? A radiation detector... Not unlike Geiger counter. [beeping] All clear. Well, you've all been exposed to some low-level radiation, but nothing lethal and nothing that's gonna turn you to one of those things out there. Lisa's made some rather startling discoveries about our zombie friends. Essentially the radiation caused their genes to mutate. Right. It's almost an immune response as their bodies try to adapt to a level of radiation that should have killed them. Ah... They're turning into something other than human. But I think on some instinctive level, they realize this and so they crave unmutated human blood because it slows the rate of their metamorphosis. Well, what about the whole sexual thing? Right. Well, the radiation affected the limbic section of the brain, which controls our base instincts, hunger, thirst and sex. The radiation has exacerbated these needs to psychotic proportions. No shit. So, what if they don't get our blood they'll die? No. I think our blood slows the process, but the contamination is causing massive radiation sickness, tumors and deteriorating mental faculties. Yeah, we ran into a couple of bloodsuckers that hadn't deteriorated mentally. But still wanted to fuck though. Yes. Well, they probably didn't drink enough human blood or didn't get to it soon enough. But there's nothing I found under dissection-- Damn, woman, you cut up one of them things? Of course. So, they'll eventually just die of cancer? Probably. The ones that drink unmutated blood but that could take weeks. I think I'm gonna be sick again. That's not the part that makes me sick. Damn. What does make you sick, that these things don't floss? No. There must be millions of people out there who didn't get to drink human blood. So, their mutations will be progressing. I'm just glad we'll be leaving soon. Leaving? We just got here. Uhm. The mutations will get worse. The monsters outside will get bigger and badder. And the zombie fuckfest will turn into one nasty-ass flesh-eating orgy. Right. I don't want to be here when that happens. Do any of you? No, thanks. [zombies groaning] [Monte] There are twelve million people in the Los Angeles area. We believe most of them have stayed indoors trying to understand their transformation from human into... Bloodsucker motherfuckers. Succinctly put, yes. Tomorrow morning, we drive to Santa Monica Airport. From there we fly up to the Big Bear Lake area where we have our ranch. I built the ranch with a day such as this in mind. It's a compound, really. Infirmary, laboratories and stockpiles of food, weapons and supplies for at least a year. I'm sorry, you built a zombie-proof compound for when this day might happen? [Monte laughing] Actually, yeah. I always expected the earth would be destroyed by a giant asteroid. It's one of the problems of being a scientist. You understand just how fragile is the basket the human race has all its eggs in. Mm-Hm. And what are we supposed to do when we get there? We live, David. I'll try to find some kind of cure but essentially we live. There must be pockets of humanity all over the world, some of the scientists doing the same thing. Now phone lines appear to be down now. Sooner or later communications of a sort will be restored. Anyway, that's our plan. But what makes you think that the folks up there at Big Bear won't be as hungry as the folks here? Because they're all dead. Our ranch is fully monitored for security purposes. [Monte] As you can see, there are many dead bodies, but no moving, blood-sucking motherfuckers. Wait a second. I realize I'm a little slow but I don't get it. Big Bear is at seven-thousand feet, the atmosphere is thinner up high. They got more radiation and died before they could mutate. Now that the solar flare has past, we should all be safe out there. What if we're the only survivors? Earth has over six billion people. So, even if 99.9 percent of the population were affected, that still leaves a lot of us unexposed. But you are forgetting one thing. What's that, Dog? If cars don't work, means probably planes don't fly. Exactly. Gasoline doesn't combust. I'm sure aviation fuel's the same. You're right, but I've been trying to save the world in a much smaller way for some time. I drive an electric vehicle. And my aircraft is similarly propelled. I tested the van earlier and all is well. Excellent. So, now we have to get to the airport without getting attacked. That is our biggest obstacle, which is why we waited for others to join us. We realized that alone, making the trip, we had little hope for survival. Well, I've never been to Big Bear. It's beautiful up there. You'll love it.

It's been a very stressful day. Bitch, I know it's been a very stressful day. Don't bitch it, okay? Damn. Sorry, baby. It's just that this whole zombie thing got me all wired, you know. Me too, baby. [zombies groaning] What were you in the real world? I was a cop. Hm. You married? Used to be. You? I never had the time. Well, it's all you're gonna have now, at least when you're not trying to find a cure to save the world. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, if I can't, we better start having babies. I mean, we, in terms of the survivors. Man, Dragon, you know what, you are not? -What? -A hopeless romantic. [snorts] I'm romantic, all right? Problem is they don't know what they want. You think they want it nice and soft. But what they really want is for you to smack that ass and slap them upside-- [old man] I don't wanna hear that cochino . Look, why does it really matter, old man? The best women in the world are taken. I know how to unwire both of us. Oh, yeah? What's up? Nothing, baby. He put his hands on you, didn't he? That sick bastard raped you, did he? No. G, no. Dragon didn't touch me, okay? It's just some kind of weird day, you know. You think? [zombies groaning] This could be my last night on earth. I leave in the morning. Is that so, soldier? [zombies groaning] [bed creaking] Damn, get a room. They got a room. We want a soundproof room. [Lisa moaning] Faster. [moaning] Faster. [moaning] [bed creaking] [moaning] -[bed creaking] -[moaning] [bed creaking and thumps] Quiet! Oh, Jesus. Yeah, we should go. What the hell was that? You looking over my-- Are you fucked up? Game over, man. Fucking zombies wasn't enough, now they got electrician zombies. Hey. Hey, you know those bigger badder monsters? They're here. We live through this, you and me are just gonna have a reckoning. Now what? Well, we can sit here and watch these two idiots out macho each other and then become hamburger helper for our friends outside. I don't think so. Where's my dad? Said he was going down the lab. We have to get him. He's gonna get trapped. Wait, wait. I'll go down and get your father. You take everybody downstairs. And if I'm not in a garage in two minutes, you leave without me. -No, no, we go together. -[man] Yeah, it's worked so far. Fine. You and Castor watch our six, okay? G, you're with me. [zombies groaning] Oh. Jesus. They don't look like they're gonna die anytime soon. That's new phase of mutation. That could be the next step of human evolution. Not if I can help it. [shot] [shots] [old man] Fucking zombies. Alright, come on, let's go back. There is another way. [David] Oh, shit. Coming. [man] Man, come this way. Great. Zombies on steroids. Hope they don't want to fuck. Out here off the roof there are some stairs that lead to the basement. Oh, shit. I'm coming. Dragon, no. I'm sorry. [shots] Get up! [Dragon] Get up. Get up. Come on. Shit. Fuck. [shots] I'll see you on the other side. To all my friends. [screaming] [Dragon groans] [screams] [zombies groaning] [Lisa] Dad! Dad! Dad! Lisa. -Dad. -Lisa, I'm glad you're here. I've just been reviewing satellite images. There appear to be no zombies around the airport. We should leave now while there's still time. Dad, didn't you hear the noise? They've broken through the gate, they're in the house. Good Lord. Where are the others? They didn't make it. You got power in here? Of course. Is the power out? Yeah, they're zombies ate it. Oh, no. We have redundant power for this room. But if the house power goes out, the van will be discharging back into the charger. We have to leave before the batteries are drained. -I have to get something first. -Wait, wait a second. Lisa. She's always been impetuous. I remember one Christmas there was-- Doc, we got to go. Quick. I think this might come in handy. I've only got one clip but-- Damn, girl. Where was you when the Second Street Crips came through? I have several contracts with the military. Lisa insisted that I use my connections. She was quite prescient. Got a lot more of them at the ranch. -You know that's illegal. -You gonna arrest me, officer? [Lisa] Turn left at the end and then up the stairs, it leads to the garage. [Latiffa] G! [shot] [David] Go, go, go, I got him. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. [zombies groaning] [zombies groaning] Lisa! Duck! Damn. Come on. Get in. [G-Dog groans] It's broken. -Need no doctor to tell me that. -Oh, it's alright. You got a door opener or something? [thumps on the door] The power's out. I think we need to help these young people out. What do you say? Never cared much for the mountains anyhow. Dad, no! Dad, no. -Lisa, listen to me. -No. -No. -Lisa, listen to me. You have to find a cure. -We'll find a cure together. -If you can't, you have to start the human race all over again. No. No. I wouldn't have traded being your father for anything in the world. My time is done. You have to go on. Now get in the van! I love you. I love you. Thank you. I never did get your name sir. I guess it doesn't matter now. Jorge, Jorge Gonzales. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gonzales. [zombies groaning] Looks like a smart dude. David! Get going. -David, no! -Just do it. [David] Ah! [David] Smile you son of a-- [shot] That wasn't so bad. [groans] [zombie groans] [groans] [Lisa] Get in the van already. ♪♪♪ Shit. What is it? I never thought I'd actually make it out there alive. Welcome to the new world, G-Dog. My name is Gerald. ♪♪♪
