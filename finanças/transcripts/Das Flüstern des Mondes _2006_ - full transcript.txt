Start ! With what! I said start ! I don't know where to start ! What gave you the idea of trying to kill half the government ? That had nothing to do with us. What does it stand for... "Project Laurin" ? That was only a joke! We found your material. You will need to bring order into the chaos now - I want to know every little detail ! Maybe it was because I had just fallen in love, but I had the feeling that there was a weird karma in the air when it all started. The Internet has just collapsed because of a killer virus and the town council were panicking about wrong telephone connections and traffic light failures. A devastating epidemic raged through South America and the pension funds would probably have liked to import it to our country, too. NASA was accused of never having landed on the moon and couldn't refute the allegations. Still, the weirdest of all occurrences took place far, far away. An astronomer discovered an unusual star constellation at the center of the Milky Way. A human shape. Even the smallest detail was anatomically correct. From a statistical point of view, it's symmetry was impossible. But when they noticed that one of it's arms was pointing at the Earth... ...the shit really hit the fan. It was around that time that Patrick and I decided to start our project. We had been preparing for it for weeks and now we were finally ready. Ready to go ? It all seems to be working ! Anything but... If I had known then all the things that would not be working I probably would have run away. But, there I was, sitting in a small caravan next to the man of my dreams thinking with my cock, rather than my brain. OK. Daily record - Project Laurin. August 12 Time: Zero four hundred hours. Patrick and I have just finished distributing the cameras. Transmission works and the batteries for the transmitters will last exactly 10 days. Now we only have to work out which one of us should be going into the lion's den. Beside the miniature cameras we had hidden all over the grounds there was also on concealed in a pair of old glacier goggles. One of us was supposed to wear them to catch some of the live action. We got all of out equipment from Patrick's mother. She was a journalist at a small private TV station, and supported her son's ambition to go freelance. Patrick had a new business idea. Documentaries for the Internet. I had no experience whatsoever, but Patrick wanted me to become his business partner. And I would have done almost anything to win him over. Now we only have to decide who has to go into the lion's den. Ok. Lets play rock, paper, scissors ! You are going ! So you chatted up a cripple to realize your perverted dreams ? Patrick was neither a cripple, nor did I chat him up. He was the one who picked me up after a concert. We had already been together for 3 months, although we had no sex. But he was mentally handicapped ! You can't say that ! He experienced a trauma in his youth and has been mute ever since. Buy apart from that... ...and the nightmares that constantly haunted him, he was completely normal. You need to economize a bit with the batteries, honey. In this cold they get used up in no time. When Patrick was five, he witnessed a terrible tragedy. His mother had identified an archeological site from some aerial photographs. The remains of an old ship or something like that. No idea if she ever found it. Anyway, his father never returned from that trip. That was the end of Patrick's speech. However, what hurt him most was that his mother tore up all the family photos after the incident and he could not remember what his father looked like. What makes you think you know what he dreamed about ? He told me so often that I can see every single detail of it. Continue ! Why did he sneak into that circus ? As I said, we played rock, paper, scissors. Patrick's part was to play undercover agent. He has weird eyes and smells funny All well and good that you are fed up with the world out there. But we always get guys like you who run away from home. If we had to feed them all, there would be nothing left for the camels to eat ! Higher, higher, don't cut his head off... and pan to the right so we've got them both. Level out, back to the director. He will provide his own food and is asking us for a trial period He seems to know how hard life at the circus really is. Then he might just as well take over your duties. Lets see what he's worth ! Patrick wanted to hit it big with his first film. It was about a grotesque case. Two corrupt council members had died and there were rumours that come mad person had put deadly poison dart frogs in their houses. These small things from the rainforest, that you shouldn't touch if you find them in your bed. Somehow Patrick had heard rumours that the circus people were secretly breeding these frogs here. And we wanted to get that on camera. But first on the agenda was some toilet cleaning. Don't you dare laugh ! The local observatory reports unusually strong solar activity this month. Maybe there is another reason for the massive demonstrations against the municipal authorities, which according to their opponents, only came to power due to electoral fraud. However, the mayoress currently also has other things to worry about. Three of her councillors have died this month under mysterious circumstances. The authorities haven't made any comments regarding the exact cause of death. Only yesterday the town finances councillor died in this villa. And what about this creature here ? I am really sorry, but I have no idea what this is. All I can say is that it is not a native frog. The authorities consistently refuse to give as any information, which means that we have to depend on tip-offs from the public. I have here an anonymous report that is very similar to Cz√∂ppan's maid's statement. Both victims died during the night and the next morning a small yellow frog was spotted next to the bodies, such as the one here. A Phylobates terribilis. I do know this frog very well. It lives in the Amazon region. And what if someone had imported such a creature ? I really can't imagine that. You need to remember that this species is so poisonous, that just one drop of it's poison would be enough to kill 10 adults ! Who would go to all that trouble ? Maybe someone who plans to use it as as deadly weapon ? Stay tuned, News-a-la-carte will be back in a moment. They had given Patrick a trial period at the circus. Our specifically made overall probably helped make him look harmless. Yet, you had to be wary of strangers then. One politician after the other fled, either going on business trips or on holiday. The media seemed amused by the stir the deadly frogs from the rainforest had caused. Patrick's mother was of course also working on the case. But she had no idea that we were in competition with her. Ladies and gentlemen ! Damn, my knee ! That was just waiting to happen ! I am not acting ! I told you that three numbers are too many. But you are too stingy to employ an additional person ! One day I will get myself killed here ! What are you staring at ? Go back to work ! That guy got on our nerves from the very beginning. I admit, every story needs an asshole in a supporting role ! Someone who is always trouble. So if he hadn't already been there, we would have had to make him up. But you have to be careful that these characters don't get the upper hand. Hey Patrick. How do you like the show ? Do you have any advice as how to improve it ? You just need a bit of practice. A few night shifts and you'll get there. I'm gonna go for a beer now. Grit your teeth ! Don't play the clown here, but stick to the facts. Patrick would have liked it. Tell me, how did you communicate with that cripple ? Do you know how to use sign language ? Not really. But when you love someone as much as I loved Patrick... Somehow it always worked. I imagined hearing his voice as if he could speak loud and clear. Which film is that from: "Food that has been exposed to radiation, tastest nice" ? Are our videos okay ? They could be better ! The camera is still shaking too much. Especially when you talk to someone, your hands are always in the picture. We need to do something about that ! You know that you stand no chance as a film-maker if you are mute. You will be able to overcome your trauma with my expert help. Once you finally sleep with me, you'll be groaning like a rutting bison. Stop it ! I am not ready yet ! If you don't want to sleep with me I'll have to jerk off until I drop. Why don't you get it ? I love you, Patrick ! Sex is important to me, but you are much more important. Is that also from a film ? Who is that guy here ? I recently found that on the flea markey. It's the last remaining photo of Tashunco Uitco in the world. Crazy Horse - the greatest warrior of all times ! He beat General Custer at the Little Big Horn and he was gay ! A holy relic if you look at it from a spiritual point of view ! If this red indian guy means so much to you that you carry his photo in your wallet instead of mine... then you better fuck him. Spiritually or whatever ! Patrick was anything but an easy person to be with but he has stolen me heart. My knees not only turned to jelly but became liquid. However, he would stand no chance as a film-maker if his speech didn't come back. But somehow that didn't seem to bother him. You need to economize a bit with the batteries, honey. In this cold they get used up in no time. We have to cross these crevasses here. I'm not going to risk my child's life, just because you are desperate for an exclusive. We wanted to spend a nice holiday together and not chase after some story. If we turn around now, the wind will cover the site with snow and it will be lost forever ! As you don't seem to want to leave this mountain without a sensational story... I'll give you some good headline material ! And then one night there was this huge storm. I was asleep and missed the start of it. But it should be under this timecode, really. Ok, I'm here. What's the matter ? Wheezing in the caravan...? ...a child is groaing in the caravan ? ...it's flowing, it's squeezing, it's strangling... Not so fast ! - once more... There is smoke coming from inside the caravan ? You mean there is a fire ? Shall I call the fire brigade ? What do you mean, that would take too long ? You want to go inside ? Are you crazy ? Patrick, stop - don't do that ! Patrick, what's wrong ? Switch that light off ! I use this trick to lure sexy men into my den and tie them to my bed. But something must have gone wrong with the smoke mixture today. You want to know why you had to turn off the light ? Usually I only tell friends such intimate details ! I think my name is Kolja... But everyone calls me "Mo" here. Xeroderma pigmentosis... I can't be exposed to ultraviolet light. No sun, neon tubes, light bulbs, screens... Only specially filtered light. It's congenital ! A genetic defect that only occurs in one in 250,000 people. As little as half an hour of sunlight can cause severe burns and skin cancer. Most of us die when we are children. I am still here. I guess I must be chosen... A little bit of light from torch will not kill me of course. But I have to be careful. The effects of the rays add up. That's why I live at night. When the day seeps away and darkness creeps up like a ghost. When the smell of fire is in the air, with a hint of cinnamon. That is when my adventures start. Never read "Captain Bluebear" ? More than 30 years ago I stared at the television, fascinated by the blurred images that supposedly were transmitted to Earth from another planet. Now NASA admitted that they had never landed on the moon. Millions of people who grew up surronded by lies and fake evidence now ask themselves what they can and cannot believe. Does the whole history of mankind need to be rewritten ? I guess. There are a lot of indications that our history books are incorrect. For example, human footprints have been found next to those of dinosaurs within the same strata. There are indications that AIDS is an artificial epidemic and that no one has ever won the lottery. Buy who cares - it seems obvious that we all want to be deceived. And who could have interest in getting us to believe all these stories ? No idea. There are countless numbers of conspiracy theories. Most of them assume that we are being misinformed so that we keep calm and pay our taxes. Fake plane crashes and epidemics seem to be a good way of keeping us from being too critical. Could I have a moment ? Come with me to the edit suite. I am Jannis' sister. He has disappeared without a trace. He told me something about a secret project. Take a seat ! I don't usually rummage around in my brother's stuff, but I found this in his room today. Do you think that they are involved in this ? Who are "they" ? Don't you know that my brother and your son are a couple ? I wasn't even sure if Patrick was gay. I wouldn't worry about that. There has been a fourth victim today. The case is therefore of public interest. But I will look into this, just in case. This is nothing but speculation. You are telling us about events you haven't even witnessed. Either I tell the story the way I believe it has happened... ...or you can finish my case right now. You'll probably do that anyway. Okay, continue. But don't push your luck. I'll be damned if I do that, I am just doing this for Patrick after all. Had I not been so obsessed with getting him into bed, who knows... Maybe I would have noticed the disaster that was approaching us in time. Careful with that hammer, camel fart ! I am working on my own number. Originally I wanted to flood the circus ring, but that was too complicated. A woman... in a deck chair. The rest is under construction. But the Bellys have already installed special lights for me. You were fucking the circus employees ? That was nothing. I just had to make sure that he wouldn't tell on us. And anyway, I was really pissed off with Patrick that day. He told me that he made up the story about the frogs. Why made up ? I thought a house maid saw such a frog ? Yes, after Patrick paid her to say that. I guess he never forgave his mother for the incident with his father. And now he wanted to get his own back on her. And why go through all that trouble at the circus ? That was Patrick's sense of drama. He assumed that the circus would have those frogs. And that his mother would be so clever as to find them sooner or later. That was supposed to be Patrick's big showdown. "Star journalist falls for fictitious story". Great backdrop, great pictures. But then things got out of control. I admit Patricks's plan was nasty. But also a cool story about how easily the press can be manipulated. However, there was a catch. There was no sign whatsoever of our bait, the poison dart frogs. And while I spent hours staring at our monitors trying to find out where the creatures might be hidden, I suddenly got the feeling that we were not the only ones who were there under false pretences. You weren't thinking of going to sleep yet ? I wanted to invite you for some food, to thank you for saving me. Mo really was weird. She was slightly over the top and had a tendency towards exaggeration. However, Patrick always was attracted to odd characters. There was definitely no harm in being careful. Whistle if someone's coming ! That is something special for our western civilization cripples. But indigenous people always believed that the objects in the sky were alive. When the Inuit saw a shooting star for example, they said that the stars were taking a shit. How I learned how to break open locks ? After my parent's death, I travelled around the world to look for a curve. I learned quite a lot then. Of course this also caused me a lot of problems. The last interrogation the cops dragged me to... lights switched on of course - almost killed me. I begged and pleaded. I would even have let them touch me as long as they turned off the light. But they only laughed at me and switched on even more lights. I woke up in hospital... with a fever and third degree burns. Then I swore to myself that I would get my revenge one day. When the circus came into town I ran away from the clinic. The Bellys hid me without asking any stupid questions and now they are my family and I feel safe here. What do you mean, if I know everything about them ? What is in the caravan they always disappear into ? Maybe you shouldn't put too great a strain on our hospitality ! And then I finally had Patrick where I wanted him. Now I only had to be careful not to lose control. Because one of the worst things in life is your own face during orgasm. A wretched, ridiculously distorted grimace. Since I discovered that I have been rehearsing in front of a mirror so that I can be relaxed and have complete control during that moment. What's wrong ? I am a burden to you. What are you talking about ? Maybe I will never learn how to speak again. I don't want you to stay with me out of pity. I am not with you because I pity you, but because of your horny arse. And a randy cock ? Of course. And now I'd like you to do me a favour and say it. Say "cock" for me. Just once. You promised me that we would practice together. Cock is almost a magical word. Just listen how it almost melts on the tongue: cock ! Cock ! Wow - my lover can say cock ! His first new word was not mummy or daddy. No it was... I think that we have to stop our project. The tip-off seems to have been wrong. There are no poisonous frogs here. They don't just run around on the street, you know. You should start working on Mo. There is something mysterious about her, like dark poetry. She must know something. You need more of the hunting instinct. Tashunco Uitco was gay and still married three times. Sometimes you have to make a pact with the enemy, even if it means making sacrifices. Maybe your Tashunci had a screw loose ? It's difficult to analyse this, but if that is Mo then she's been lying to you about her illness. Interesting, no ? But it wasn't only Patrick's mother who had something to think about. I was not prepared for the next headline. Was my lover making all this up ? How could they have seized such a frog ? You told me you made it all up ?! Don't pretend that this doesn't concern you ! This business is starting to go all pear shaped, my friend. This is the work of a copycat. Someone who has as even nastier plan than us. Newspapers are only good for wrapping fish in, or frogs. We will put an end to the speculation now. This is a terrible situation. The whole shit is getting to bury my circus... Calm down. I have everything under control. Don't fuck me. The press makes a great fuss about this. Sooner or later they'll find us... If you are not up to the task then, I'll find someone else. I expect you to resolve the matter within the week. Thank you in advance, goodbye. Rene, get the veterinary guy on the phone. No, I will call again later. Thanks. May I offer you something exotic ? I don't smoke. I only have a little time. What can I do for you ? It has been exactly a year since you came to power. To date you have not managed to refute the accusations that your votes were not correctly counted. Was there a grain of truth in the rumours ? This is beneath you, Foussek. We have known each other for too long. We both know that you are not interested in this rubbish. What do you really want ? Three of your colleagues are dead. The others are probably frightened out of their minds. I'm just wondering if it really is a coincidence that your biggest critics within the party have suddenly all been silenced. If you make the slightest mention of this in your program I will have you by the balls. You know very well that I have nothing to do with the poisonous frog attacks. For the record: I don't know who's behind these attacks and what they want to achieve with them. But if we catch the perpetrator, I personally will make sure that he will be made comfortable in our new penitentiary hotel. Our policies will not change because of my colleagues' tragic deaths. I won't be blackmailed by anyone ! You don't believe in the poisonous frog attacks ! We have to get rid of the animals ! People are totally hysterical ! No way. You know pretty well that I still need them. If they find them here - cirque kaput ! What should they find ? We just won't let anyone in. I'll kill anyone who touches my frogs. So now we finally found what we had been loking for. But at the same time the game turned deadly serious. If there were really poisonous frogs here, then the murders were probably real, too. How did you come across this circus anyway ? Didn't you tell me about it ? Then it must have been someone else. Of course - but who ? Have a good think ! Was the story really your idea or has someone put it in your head ? Maybe someone lured us here to use us as scapegoats for the real murders. You don't seriously believe that someone here would kill politicians ? Why else would they breed deadly creatures and keep it secret ? This whole thing has become really serious, Patrick ! Our carefully arranged plan is starting to turn against us. We'll stop the filming immediately and leave this place. We can't. Bolko will be suspicious if I suddenly disappear. And if they are really invloved with those killings, they will find us anywhere. Mo is our last remaining chance. We have to grill her. I think you are starting to like her. Why all this political conspiracy crap ? I am not sure anymore. Maybe he knew more than he told me. Still, no matter if Patrick made the frog story up or if is was really the result of rumours, one thing was for certain: we had stepped into a pile of bat's shit. Everything inside me wanted to flee. Run away, hide away, trick my brain away But, as I said, Patrick wanted his revenge and I wasn't able to deny him any wish. Why did Ribanna follow Winnetou ? She was supposed to stay with the woman. Ribanna did not follow Winnetou, but her heart. Does Ribanna not fear the threatening danger ? Ribanna has no fear as long as she is able to see Winnetou. Because the sun within her hair is stronger than any dark cloud. Does Ribanna want to become Winnetou's wife ? Yes - she does ! So Winnetou will speak to his people... I have to ask you something... That's really cool but I can't marry you. Our children would probably grow up without a mother. A tough fight lies ahead of us. We will attack the Apaches' pueblo and raze it to the ground. To a free Texaz ! How do you pay the circus for food and accomodation ? It is none of your business, really, but I do jobs that can only be done at night. You feed their frogs. Are they being used for those murders ? Why do you care so much for those politician arseholes ? There are people in constant danger who should mean a lot more to you than them. I for example could die at any moment. I'll get a headache, throw up and three hours later I'll be dead ! But I'll tell you a secret - your life will be over soon, too. You should start appreciating it while you still can. You know the way home ! Stuntman badly injured at Western Show. Sixth politician dead - poison frog affair brings nobel price winner on to the scene. Liane Foussek speaking. Have you heard from your brother Jannis yet ? Please call me back as soon as you get this message. Thank you for meeting me. I need your advice. Still the frog killers ? Forget it, there have been no murders. The alleged victims probably caught some tropical disease on a lecture tour in South America. According to the doctors, the epidemic has similar symptoms to the frog poison. So what do you want from me ? I have to find my son. This nonsense about the frogs clearly has his trademark. But I suspect he was using it as red herring. This was on his computer ! There are rumours that have been going around for a while now. They say that our mayoress was replaced by a look-alike because she wasn't loyal to her party. Those who don't go along with it are murdered. But I hope you don't believe this nonsense. Not really. Though she has been acting weird recently. My son got out of his depth. I have to find him before something terrible happens ! We'll keep in contact. Ladies and gentlemen, the world famous clown Bolko - and his dancing shoes ! Music ! There you have it. I'll probably be out of action for at least two weeks. The premiere of our new show is the day after tomorrow. Forget that. No one can replace me. They're all overworked as it is. "You will do - with a costume looks won't matter !" "Everyone helps at the circus. You do it or you go !" This is a disaster. Now the authorities are looking for us too. If someone has seen this, then we are in the shit ! Calm down - they were all at the rehearsal in the circus ring. Yes, but they probably faked the accident to deceive you. Never mind becoming famous. Either the circus people or the police will catch us. We don't have to stick it out forever. It shouldn't take long now that it has finally clicked in my mother's brain. I guess that she already is on her way to the frogs. Before then, we have to win MO over to our side. That is important. And what if Mo is the killer ? Just think about it. The murders all happened at night, which is when the frogs are active. And who is sneaking around here at night with housebreaking tools ? Who has a reason for getting their own back on society ? I followed her after the Western show. Unfortunately I lost her. But the next day another politician was dead. If they are using our idea with the poison frogs and the authorities are behind the murders then they definitely wouldn't give the job to people from the circus. That's what they have secret services for. No, they can't even trust their own people with a mission like that. They need outsiders for this kind of dirty work ! Sounds like a badly written script. Maybe that's why there could be something in it. I just can't imagine that Mo could kill someone. True, she's not quite right up there, but she's nice in her own way. Is there a reason for me to be jealous ? I am sorry, but the music just doesn't go with the picture. That night our fate was sealed without any further warning. 25th August zero three hundred hours and fourteen. Two hours until dawn. Mo leaves her protective shelter more and more often. Once again I was hiding behind one of those pissed on bushes and could clearly sense that something was going to happen, and that it involved Mo. I think she is using Patrick. The question is why and for how long I should keep watching. Jealous or not. I didn't fancy another sleepless night. A decision I was soon to regret bitterly. Can you put some soap on my back ? Didn't you say you were gay ? Or was that just an act to woo me ? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you are hetero. Can you have a look at that spot, it's sore. The cancer starts to spread when the skin is raw. Go on, you can tell me. Our clothes are gone ! It will be light soon ! There must be a key somewhere ! If Mo really suffered from this illness then she was in real danger and Patrick would have had a chance to make her talk. Instead he was sucking up to her with a pained expression on his face. The door - why don't you throw yourself against it or something ! Hurry up ! Even if they didn't reach the princess bedchamber at the very last moment... it was a close shave. Of course I hadn't touched their clothes, but Patrick was in shock and couldn't think straight. Cut to the caravan. Why did you lock us in ? - What did I do ? Admit that you wanted to test her. - Are you crazy ? After I received only a crash signal from your goggles, I went to have a look but the hall was locked. I thought you had left already. It must have been somebody ! And you think it was me ? This women has blinded you ! Okay, I don't trust her. But that doesn't mean that I would risk her life. You are the one who wouldn't stop at anything for your film ! What are you talking about ? You know what I mean... The way you want to hurt your mother. That doesn't have to bother you ! I think that you are not trying to overcome your trauma. It seems that you fancy yourself in the part of the sad mute hero. You will play this role until it destroys you. This has been going on too long. The project is cancelled ! If you sabotage me now, then we are history ! What do your little queer problems have got to do with the murders ? They set off the big showdown. Finish the story. I am starting to get impatient. So did the mayoress. In view of the persistent rumours your lot is spreading I am herewith stating that I am not a look-alike replacing the real mayoress. Or whatever other ridiculous story is going around. Rest assured that I am still the same person you voted for. But I admit, I did keep a secret from you. I am a fossil and I am so old fashioned to believe that my private life doesn't need to be made public. Of course, that doesn't suit the stereotype of a tough politician who takes drastic action, sorts out the mess and who hasn't got any personal weaknesses. But whatever. I recently had cosmetic surgery. A facelift to correct the bags under my eyes and the wrinkles on my neck. Here you have your photo ! Satisfy your sensationalism and print it. And then we'll forget about the circus and start doing some serious work again. Ladies and Gentlemen. Dear audience, dear children ! I appreciate to introduce the biggest sensation of all sensations. Please welcome Patrizio... and Bolko, his marionette ! We were in a ridiculous situation. Patrick's mother and the police thought that we were the frog killers and we had no evidence to prove our innocence. Mo was unapproachable since the incident with the clothes. And now Patrick even had to appear in front of an audience. It was only a question of time until someone would recognize him beneath the simple makeup. Even if I had every reason to be scared of going to prison soon... what made me suffer the most was Patrick's distrust. Who knows, had we not argued maybe I could have convinced him to run. But now he was about to make the biggest mistake of his life. I want to tell you something but I need to know first if you have anything to do with the frog murders ? Do you have a cigarette ? Patrick come out of there... Come and talk to me. I am sorry about what I said... Are you crazy making such a racket ? Patrick, stop that rubbish. You don't need to test me. If the project is really that important to you, then I will help you of course. Which project ? Did he steal our clothes ? I warned you from the very beginning not to trust this camel fart. He is really bad stuff... Who is paying you for this... a private detective ? Go on, admit it, you were supposed to find Mo and grass on her to the cops ! We are not after Mo. We only wanted to do a film for our website. I didn't lock you in. That was probably the caretaker. I guess he was pissed off that you sneaked into his building. You said yourself that that happens to you all the time. That's possible. But I still don't know what's going on here. Patrick wanted to know about our frogs. I think we all agree... it would be risky for us to let them live. But that means we'll risk having the police snoop around here soon. We don't know with whom they are in contact. Translate ! They want destiny to decide. One of you has to spend the night with the frogs in the box. They think the creatures have a sixth sense. If you have told us the truth, they will spare you. But that's madness. You can't do that ! I have to agree with the family's decision. You have ten minutes to decide who will make a sacrifice for the other. I don't think this is a good opportunity to play rock, paper, scissors. What ? I'll go ! You want to go in the box ? No way ! If anyone has the right to show his valor it's me. Damn it Patrick, I am scared. That sounds awful. That's it ? The boy is dying in the box ? That's supposed to be the end ? I thought Patrick wanted to play a trick on his mother. Big showdown and all. That was the plan. We had bought nonpoisonous frogs especially. The circus people didn't breed their frogs to kill anyone but instead Bolko used their diluted serum for his knee pains. Patrick carefully directed the whole scene. And once his mother found the video tapes, he wanted to jump out of the box and make up with her. At least that's what I think And the circus people played along with this ? First they made a big fuss after they found out about us. Of course they wanted to chuck us out. But Patrick always knew how to win people over. He promised them free advertising on his website. But he is dead now nevertheless. Someone must have exchanged the frogs again. Don't say it was the mayoress... As revenge for Patrick finding out about her secret surgery. It only was a facelift,... wasn't it ? Okay, whatever. Your time is up. Please follow me. We are fully booked. Bare with me a moment ! Here are the seminar documents... ...and that's your material. If you could sign here please... at the bottom. And as you were the first one to book our hardocre version you will get 15% off the course fee ! But I still don't have a solution for my film I regret, but I don't think we can help you there. The whole plot about the frogs and the conspiracy theory... is unbelievable. Maybe you should try a different story. Have a look at the teaching material and come back with a new topic in six months. We look forward to working with you again ! If there is something I regret... then it is that I never got the chance to tell him the truth about his father. Patrick never asked why they never found his body. Even though the crevasse wasn't very deep and the rescue team went down to the very bottom. The truth is... ...that Patrick's dad never committed suicide. Yes, he did jump. We both saw it. But he must have been hiding somewhere on a ledge. I saw him again years later in Italy. I never told Patrick about it. I knew that... ...his father's supposed suicide was troubling for him but I thought that the discovery that his father just left him would destroy him. Well, that was it. We will probably never find out if the business with the frogs was an accident or if someone swapped them on purpose.
