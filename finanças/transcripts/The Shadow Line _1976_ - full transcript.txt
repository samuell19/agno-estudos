A film by Andrzej Wajda THE SHADOW LINE Starring: Music: Scenography: Costumes: Editing: Director of photography: Directed by: From The Vidar? This is not a marriage story. My action had more the character of divorce almost of desertion He's leaving us, going back home. - Home? - To England. For no apparent reason I abandoned the ship. It was in an eastern port, Singapore. Sign off and on again? No, signing off for good. Something wrong? No. He leaves us to go home. I was the first officer on the "Vidar" an excellent boat. I had great respect for Captain Kent He must have wondered what came over me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, was once young, and perhaps he understood what was for me so hard to express. These eighteen months... Please do not think that I am ungrateful... they were so good filled with diverse experiences. But I feel... How shall I put it? I feel that there was no truth to be got out of them What truth? Well, this is as if you think that you should go, I can not keep you by force. I hope you find something that you seem to look for . You realize that within next three or four days there is no mailboat sailing to England Thank you. And so, I left Captain Kent's ship like a bird flies away from a comfortable branch One day I was perfectly right, and the next everything was gone glamour, flavour, interest, contentment - everything It was one of these moments when one perceives the shadow line A warning one that youth is gone The green sickness of late youth descended on me and carried me off I was a man without a ship. With three days delay waiting for boat home. A passenger. I made my way to the Officers' Sailors' Home. Oh Dear! Oh Dear! What is it now? I see you're not too busy? Can you give me the same room, as the last time? It is only for a couple of days. Perhaps you would like to pay in advance? Certainly not! Never heard of such a thing! This is the most infernal cheek Oh, dear! Don't fly out like this. I am asking everybody. I don't believe it, - Well I am! And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamilton pay up, too. He's always turning up ashore dead broke, and even when he has some money he doesn't want to pay I don't know what to do with him He swears at me and tells me I can't chuck a white man out into the street here Any one I know staying here? Captain Giles had just returned from a trip to Sulu Sea. Two other guests and, of course, Hamilton. Oh yes, Hamilton! Morning, Captain Giles. - I presume you came ashore for a couple of days leave? - No, I had left the ship for good. A free man for a bit? I suppose I may call myself that since eleven o'clock This infernal heat is cutting anyone's appetite. No doubt he's gone off to look after your old job He will be the death of me. He does not pay, and I constantly have trouble with the Harbour Office. I wish he'd get this job. Temporary relief for me. You needn't worry! He won't get that place. My successor is already on board. Who's that? It was an officer of some Rajah's yacht. Must have been "seeing life" last night I remember him first coming ashore here some years ago Seems only the other day. He was a nice boy. Oh! these nice boys! No! No! I didn't mean that some of them go soft mighty quick out here. It's this beatly heat. Oh no, things out East were made easy for white men. That was all right. The difficulty was to go on keeping white and some of these nice boys do not know how. Why did you come off the ship? Why? Do you disapprove? I? In a general way... And I'm starting to getting soft, time for taking my little siesta. I never refused my siesta, when I'm on shore. Very bad habit Very bad habit, indeed Having broken from family home, deprived by great distances of his comfort atmosphere I could say without exaggeration that sea became all my world. The sole thread that connected me with my homeland, were mails sent by my uncle. The letters reminded me the world that I have left thirteen years ago. Sometimes he sent a copy of the magazine "Wedrowiec", to encourage me to share my travel impressions, and by such means to support the memory of my native tongue And the customs I got handed down in my childhood. "Because... because, thank God, you do not forget your Polish, for it let... for this Let God bless you, and I bless you. It would be an exercise in your native tongue, and the tie with your homeland, with fellow countrymen, and, finally, tribute to your father, who wanted to serve with writing and served his fatherland." But the photographs of my my uncle, his wife and the remaining family members, It looked like it was a completely different world, than the one in which I live. My childhood in the Ukraine, School years in Krakow were only distant memories. And my future lay on the path that I choose. I wanted to prove that from the land, that has no outlet to the sea, There also could come good sailors. I spoke with your captain. He's very sorry you left. He had never had a mate that suited him so well I certainly hadn't been so comfortable in any ship or with any commander in all my sea-going days Well then... Haven't you heard, that I intend to go home Yes, I have heard that sort of thing so often before What of that? You shall see it done this time. Aye, to be sure. You are right there What was he trying to say? I don't know. Mustn't be down too much on a fellow. He's feeling pretty wretched, and to-morrow he'll feel worse yet Well, he will have you to look after him. They will be glad enough to get a gentleman I imagine There is no hurry What? That young ass who fancies himself for having been chief mate with Kent so long? Preposterous! He's talking of you Rubbish, my good man! One doesn't compete with a rank outsider like that. There's plenty of time What a very insulting sort of man Very insulting You haven't offended him in some way, have you? Never spoke to him in my life Can't imagine what he means by competing. He has been trying for my job after I left and didn't get it No, not likely either, with Kent Kent is no end sorry you left him He gives you the name of a good seaman, too Nothing to be annoyed about I had made up my mind to go home. I told you! Yes. You told me you meant to go home. Anything in view there? Nothing that I know of. - Paid your passage money yet? - No, I have not. There would be plenty of time to-morrow. Well, then I think you ought to know that there's something going on here. Had Steward spoken to you today? No. And I didn't want the fellow to speak to me at all. A peon was seen walking that morning on the verandah with a letter in his hand It was in an official envelope he had shown it to the first white man he came across That man was our friend in the arm-chair. He was not in a state to interest himself in any sublunary matters He could only wave the peon away. The peon then wandered until he came upon me I just happened to be by chance on the verandah. The letter was addressed to the Chief Steward. Now what could Captain Ellis, the Master Attendant, want to write to the Steward for? I do not know. It's none of my business. What would they be talking about? I do not care. They can both expire in hell! What do you think about this? Hamilton was not worth a thought. What such an offensive loafer I can't start a row with him I should only make myself ridiculous. You missed my point. Have I? I am very glad to hear it Considering what we happened to hear just now I think you ought to do it. Ought to do it? Do what? Ask the Steward what was there in that letter from the Harbour Office. Ask him straight out. And Hamilton? Exactly. Don't you let him. You do what I tell you. You tackle that Steward. You'll make him jump, I bet He is a very unsatisfactory steward and a miserable wretch but I would just as soon think of tweaking his nose Tweaking his nose Much good it would be to you. It's all too complicated for me , Captain. Oh, it is too complicated for me. I can't understand anything. Well-he's a-no account cuss You just-ask him. That's all. I say! Wait a minute. Why can't you answer when you are spoken to? "I understand there was an official communication to the Home from the Harbour Office this morning. Is that so? I could not find you anywhere. I could not run all over the town after you Who wants you to? I want to know what was in the letter. Nothing. You said that you're going home, so. why should I? I ask you to give me a letter! Give me! You would never believe it! It was a notification that a master is wanted for some ship and this fellow puts the thing in his pocket. You will be the death of me! Just three o'clock. You will be in time In time for what? Good Lord! For the Harbour Office. This must be looked into. It is nothing to me Nothing! Kent warned me you were a peculiar young fellow. You will tell me next that a command is nothing to you After all the trouble I've taken, too! The trouble! What trouble? You want to see Him? What do you think? Is it any use? My goodness! He has asked for you twice today. Oh! He has asked for me twice. Then perhaps I had better go in. You must! You must! Where have you been all this time? I had heard there was a master needed for some vessel, and being a sailing-ship man I thought I would apply Why! Hang it! You are the right man for that job They are all afraid to catch hold. That's what's the matter. Are they, sir. I wonder why? Afraid of the sails. Afraid of a white crew. Too much trouble. Too much work. Too long out here Easy life and deck-chairs more their mark. I began to think you were funking it, too I haven't been long getting to the office You have a good name out here, though I am very glad to hear it from you, sir Yes. But you are not on the spot when you are wanted. That steward of yours wouldn't dare to neglect a message from this office. Where the devil did you hide yourself for the best part of the day? Oh, take a seat. Now, are these terms acceptable? Yes, certainly. This is your appointment to the command. An official appointment binding the owners to conditions which you have accepted. Now, when will you be ready to go? Today, even now. You have heard that sailboat captain has died at sea. The ship was brought to Bangkok by the first officer Burns. Why to Bangkok, and not here? Do you know Bangkok? No white officers or telegraph. Mr. Burns is an experienced sailor, But we think he has not up to the command, although he disagrees. Now, the steamer Melita is leaving for Bangkok that evening about seven I'll request her captain officially to give you a passage And wait for you till ten o'clock. Mr. Rowley, let the harbor boat wait under steam, to pick up Captain to "Melita" at half past nine. Well, here you are now you are commanding independently registered officially under my responsibility. Good-bye and good luck! Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. I say! I say! His own launch. What have you done to him? Was it for me? I hadn't the slightest notion Yes. And the last person who had it before you was a Duke. So, there! A Duke! I have to have that ship of mine out in the Indian Ocean. From Bangkok to the Indian Ocean is a pretty long step I am familiar enough with the Archipelago, except the Gulf of Siam. The gulf... Ay! A funny piece of water-that - Goodbye. - Bye now. Goodbye, Captain Giles! Steam-launch, ahoy! Is that our passenger? It is Stand by and lower the sideladder Ay Ay, sir! Come along, sir! We have been delayed three hours for you. Our time is seven o'clock, you know! No! I do not know. I am hanged if I would have waited another five minutes Harbour-Master or no Harbour-Master. That's your own business. I didn't ask you to wait for me. I hope you don't expect any supper This isn't a boarding-house afloat. You are the first passenger I ever had in my life and I hope to goodness you will be the last. Captain! There! That's your ship, Captain We'll drift abreast her in a moment I hope you are satisfied with her I am your new Captain. Where's the first mate? In the hold, I think, sir. I saw him go down the after-hatch ten minutes ago. I'll tell him you're here, sir. I felt like the latest representative of the dynasty. Continuous not in blood indeed, but in its experience, in its training, in its conception of duty and in the blessed simplicity of its traditional point of view on life. A part of composite soul of my predecessors. Burns, the first mate. Let us go up! Please lead going. Yes. Mr Miles, the second officer. Frenchy. Smart and very willing. Frenchman? Gembril, trustworthy. Kubrick. Not too experienced, but diligent. Ransome, the cook. Cook? He doesn't look good. There is something wrong with him Has there been any sick on the ship aboard? - People look bad. - They had hard flight. Has the doctor been yet on board? - No. Ask the British Legation to send a doctor. Sure. And, Mr. Burns, order to pull sun awning over the deck. I see you have kept her in very good order She is a good ship. I suppose she can travel-what? What's the matter? Can't you tell after being nearly two years in the ship? Ship like a man, needs the chance to show the best she could do this ship had never had a chance since he had been on board of her. Not that he could remember. The last captain. Has he been so very unlucky? No, he was not an unlucky man he had not seemed to want to make use of his luck. Where did he die? In this saloon. Just where you are sitting now - I mean, where he was buried? - At the entrance to the gulf. I knew him well and saw that he was dying at seven bells in the forenoon watch I mustered all hands and told them to say goodbye to the captain . Was he conscious? He didn't speak, but he moved his eyes to look at them What was he like? Where is the violin? He threw his violin overboard! Once he mixed himself up with this woman. He vanished for a week. He came on board in the middle of the night and took the ship out to sea with the first break of dawn He steered for Hong Kong against the monsoons. Without ship's sufficient ballast. It was an insane project He never meant her to see home again. He wouldn't write to his owners He never wrote to his old wife. He made up his mind to break with everything. He shut up in his cabin, wedged in a corner of his settee and played the violin, or, at any rate, made continuous noise on it. He didn't care for business, or freights, or for making a passage He meant to have gone wandering about the world till he lost her with all hands. Yes! The captain died as near noon as possible I read the service over him at sunset then I stuck the ship's head north and brought her in here I-brought-her-in She would hardly have come in by herself But why didn't you make for Singapore instead? The nearest port Look here, Mr. Burns You may as well understand that I did not run after this command It was pushed in my way. I've accepted it. I am here to take the ship home first of all And I shall see to it that every one of you on board here does his duty to that end This is all I have to say If I hadn't a wife and a child at home I would have asked you to let me go the very minute you came on board. And I, Mr. Burns, would not have let you go You have signed the ship's articles as chief officer, and till they are terminated at the final port of discharge I shall expect you to attend to your duty and give me the benefit of your experience to the best of your ability. I'm glad to see you, Captain! How are you? You look tired. I have difficulty with your cargo. Sit down, please. Sit down, sit down. No, thank you. I need bags for cargo. I ask you, other than tobacco! Please, these are decent smokes. This is included in the bill. I need 1,100 bags. They tell me that I can not buy. You can leave them up your sleeve. Dear Captian We are not obliged to warn you about the possibility of any shortages before signing the freight contract. It is for you to prevent the delay. It is not I who signed it up. Mr. Burns. What else can I do? - Have you talked to Jacobson? - No. He is the biggest trader here. He could help. Mr. Burns hastened to sign a charter-party, which gave us a lot of trouble. It was only one episode. But how to get out the ship? Which was my ship, with its all cargo and crew, with her body and soul, weakening in the fumes of the river, how to get her into the sea? Please, report - Captain Joseph Conrad-Korzeniowski. - Captain Joseph Conrad... - Korzeniowski, to see Mr. Jacobus. Captain Joseph Konn... Get out! Get Out! Isn't it a mistake? Is this Mr. Jacobus' office? - Please come. - Come in, come in! Since you there. - Sit down. - I was instructed to come to you. I have shortage of bags. I didn't understand it nor I paid the attention. He should not bother me at this time. Sit down, Captain! Human nature is, I fear, not very nice right through. There are ugly spots in it. And there is more difficult to be the master of the ship than to know how to set sail. People have a great opinion of the advantages of experience. But in this connection experience means always something disagreeable as opposed to the charm and innocence of illusions. I must say I was losing mine rapidly. Mr. Burns is ill. He has got a fever. The steward is ill as well. I'll replace him for time being. You are a cook. Keep your duties. I can do it all right, sir as long as I go about it quietly What's the matter with you, Mr. Burns? Can a man not ever take a break, when his head breaks out with the pain? Ransome! Yes, sir? Ransom, please keep my door open. Certainly, sir. Yes. I am afraid, sir, I won't be able to give the mate all the attention he's likely to need. I will have to be forward in the galley a great part of my time. Do not worry, Ransome. We will put Mr. Burns ashore. And the doctor is on board, Sir. Your arrangements appear to me to be very judicious, my dear Captain. You seem to have a most respectable lot of seamen. I suppose the only thing now is to take care of them as you are doing till I can get the ship to sea? The sea... undoubtedly. This will require some days. Mr. Burns signed the freight contract But we have a problem with the load. How serious is it, doctor? Symptoms indicate cholera. He may not survive tomorrow. A nice boy. Too bad. Have you arranged for the replacement? Our cook is filling in for him. Are you talking Ransome? Yes, Ransome. Why? Is there anything wrong with him? Nothing. But he had a bad heart. He's getting tired very easily. And Mr. Burns? What is his condition? Not good. Without proper medical care it can be very bad. I'm taking him to the shore. Now-you've got-what you wanted got me out of-the ship. Ou were never more mistaken in your life, Mr. Burns - Where's Mr. Burns? - This Way. You do not want me to be on the ship. You want to remove me off the road. I suppose, sir, you want to make out I've acted like a fool? No! But I can not wait otherwise fever fells all my man. I have to get out the ship into the sea. If you leave me in this godforsaken place, I shall die. I feel it. I'm certain of it. You will leave me ashore. I have a wife and child in Sydney. I'm dying. I'm dying here! Orderly! Come here. Well, is everything in order? Thank you. In three days we should be at sea. And all our problems will be finished at last. Without first mate? Send the telegraph to Singapore even if you had to delay your sailing for a week Not a day longer! Look here! Unless you tell me officially that the man must not be moved I'll make arrangements to have him brought on board tomorrow and shall take the ship out of the river next morning even if I have to anchor outside the bar for a couple of days to get her ready for sea. It is your ship and your decision, Sir. It is not to me to change it. But my duty is to warn you that I consider it very unwise. Only I hope that Mr. Burns will not pay for it with his life. Won't she answer the helm at all? Yes, sir. She's coming-to slowly. Let her head come up to south Aye, aye, sir Dead Calm. The Old Man's tricks Laying down there under the sea with some evil intention. Is there no chance at all to get under way, sir? All we can do is only drift. Land on the port bow, sir. Sighted Cape Liant at daylight. About fifteen miles. This is crawling. No luck. Better luck than standing still, anyhow What is it again? I am afraid we haven't left all sickness behind us, sir. We haven't! What's the matter? At night Wright developed a fever, and Kubrick got chills. But I'm sure it is the one and the same disease. One burning, the other shivering. Do they look very ill? Middling bad, sir. And Mr. Miles is also not himself. Was there any wind at all this morning? Can hardly say that, sir. We've moved all the time though. The land ahead seems a little nearer. Only a little nearer. Tronger breeze would have blown away the contamination which clung to the ship. Well, we still have quinine. He is here, Ransome! What's the matter, Mr. Miles? What are you doing here? It is cool here. No it's dark and musty! Please, sir, leave me alone. Ransome, quinine. From the doctor. "My dear Captain. I didn't want to add to your worries by discouraging your hopes I am afraid that the end of your troubles is not yet. I'm sure you'll have to fight with recurrent fever. Fortunately, you have enough quinine. And put all hope in it... I feel I am getting much stronger. I am not smothered by that heat. In a very few days I'll be able to go on deck and help you. The only thing that really can help us, it's the wind. A fair wind You think, it would be so easy? He won't leave is in peace, until we pass the latitude 8 degrees 20 minutes, where the Old Man is buried. Are you still thinking of your late captain, Mr. Burns? I imagine the dead feel no animosity against the living. They care nothing for them You don't know that one! No. I didn't know him, and he didn't know me. And so he can't have any grievance against me, anyway. Yes. But there's all the rest of us on board. You mustn't talk so much. You will tire yourself. And there is the ship herself Now, not a word more! Impossible. It's like being bewitched, upon my word Yes, I know what you think. But you cannot expect me to believe that a dead man has the power to put out of joint the meteorology of this part of the world. Though indeed it seems to have gone utterly wrong. The land and sea breezes have got broken up into small pieces. We cannot depend upon them for five minutes together. In a very few days I will come up on deck and then we shall see. You will be most welcome there If you go on improving at this rate you'll be presently one of the healthiest men in the ship Aren't the man improving? Nobody dead? No. Why is the ship so silent? The only voice I do hear sometimes is yours, sir, and that isn't enough to cheer me up. The great thing is to get the ship past 8 d 20' of latitude Once she's past that we're all right. That's where you buried your late captain Don't you think, Mr. Burns, it's about time you dropped all that nonsense? Not surprised... find... play us some beastly trick yet You're not for long in this world. "So I am going out of the world, am I?" Yes, Sir. you haven't many days left in it One can see it by your face. "My face eh?" "Well, put up the helm and be damned to you." If I had my wish, neither the ship nor any of you would ever reach a port. And I hope you won't" His head was not gone then, He meant every word of it. But I laughed at him, and the old man cringed and turned his head away. No one has ever heard his voice. Did he talk any nonsense to you of late? Mr. Burns? No, sir. He told me this morning, sir, that he was sorry he had to bury our late captain right in the ship's way Isn't this nonsense enough for you? I do not know, sir, I haven't thought about it Again during the night we lost what we made yesterday. We have no more quinine. The jars were filled with sand. I have put Mr. Burns back to bed, sir. You have Well, sir, he got out, all of a sudden, but when he let go the edge of his bunk he fell down He isn't light-headed, though, it seems to me I need some time for cleaning. Breakfast will not be delayed. Not more than 10 minutes. Let the breakfast wait, Pick up this stuff and throw overboard. Gather the men, They have to be told about it Well, sir? It isn't well at all. That confounded fellow has taken away the scissors from me Does he think I am mad, or what? I feel as if I were going mad myself. I always thought HE would play us some deadly trick No! Well, how do you account for this? How do you think it could have happened? Why, yes, how in the name of the infernal powers did this thing happen? I suppose they have given him about fifteen pounds in Haiphong for that little lot. - Mr. Burns! - Why not? The stuff is pretty expensive in this part of the world, and they were very short of it in Tonkin And what did he care? You have not known him. I have, and I have defied him He feared neither God, nor devil, nor man, nor wind, nor sea, nor his own conscience And I believe he hated everybody and everything But I think he was afraid to die. I believe I am the only man who ever stood up to him. I faced him in that cabin where you live now, when he was sick, and I cowed him then. He thought I was going to twist his neck for him But I just laughed at him. If he had had his way we would have been beating up against the Nord-East monsoon as long as he lived and afterward, too, for ages and ages Acting the Flying Dutchman in the China Sea! But why should he replace the bottles like this? Why shouldn't he? They fit the drawer. The wrappers were there Did it from habit, I suppose and as to refilling, there is always a lot of stuff they send in paper A dirty trick. I always said he would I feel it's all my fault. Mine and nobody else's That's how I feel. I shall never forgive myself. That's very foolish, sir The man are waiting on the deck. I have to face them. To tell them the truth. I'm not going to let the gossip simply get about. It is my duty as captain, I must describe to you our predicament in which we have found ourselves. We have no more drugs for the disease, which have affected most of you. I can do no more for the sick in the way of drugs I suppose man that, you have understood what I said, and you know what that means. We can only rely on our own volition. I intend to go to Singapore, where we'll get medical assitance. The only chance for for the ship and the men is in the efforts of all of us sick and well, must make to get her along out of this That's all. Surely there is a way out of this blamed hole. There is something going on in the sky like a decomposition like a corruption of the air, which remains as still as ever. After all, mere clouds which may or may not hold wind or rain Strange that it should trouble me so Won't she answer the helm at all? Not at all Sir You are not needed. Go and lie down. Very good, sir. Thank you, sir. I feel as if all my sins had found me out But I suppose the trouble is that the ship is still lying motionless not under command and I have nothing to do to keep my imagination from running wild Why is the ship so quiet? What's the matter with the men? Isn't there one left that can sing out at the ropes? Not one, Mr. Burns There is no breath to spare on board this ship for that there are times when I can't muster more than three hands to do anything Nobody dead yet, sir? No - It wouldn't do Mustn't let him. If he gets hold of one he will get them all. Will you go down and try to eat something, sir Ransome! How long have I been on deck? I am losing the notion of time Twelve days and it's just a fortnight since we left the anchorage. All my life seemed to me infinitely distant. We may have all our sails blown away And that would be like a death sentence on the men We haven't strength enough on board to bend another suit It's like being bound hand and foot preparatory to having one's throat cut. It seems that for the first time we will have a bit of rain. I oppose to go on deck and face it. Now I understand, why in the past I felt strange sense of insecurity in my past I've always worried, that I might be no good And here is proof positive I am no good. - Somebody's dead? - No, sir, nobody's dead. How does it look outside? Very black, indeed, sir. There is something in it for certain. In what quarter? All round, sir. You think I ought to be on deck? Yes sir, I do. Shut the door of my room, will you, steward Certainly, sir. Are you there, men? All here, sir. All that are any good for anything, sir There might be a lot of wind. Try to remove the top of the sail. We must try to haul this mainsail close up Then we fix the rails. Gembril, stand by the helm! Keep the helm right amidships. Right amidships, sir. You have been helping with the mainsail! What were you thinking of? You mustn't do that sort of thing. I suppose I mustn't. I am all right now Are you there men? Lay down all halyards on deck clear for running. I'll see to that, sir. Go about it quietly, Ransome. Clear the sheets and turn down the mizzen! Do you feel strong enough to prevent the rudder taking charge if she gets sternway on her? It wouldn't do to get something smashed about the steering-gear now. We've enough difficulties to cope with as it is. I will not let the steering wheel out of your hands what next I do not know. All ready, sir. There remains the jib. Let it claps. We've done all what's possible for the ship Let's see what she is capable, when there is a lot more wind. Hang on to the wheel! - Never mind. You don't want the light. - But I should like to have a light. All you've got to do is to keep the wind at the back of your head! Do you understand? - Ay Ay, sir. - All right! Sir! First Mate! First Mate! Get out, Frenchy! Confounded dump ship! With a craven, tiptoeing crowd. Why couldn't they stamp and go with a brace? Wasn't there one Godforsaken lubber in the lot fit to raise a yell on a rope? You must go for him boldly-as I did Show him that you don't care for any of his damned tricks. Kick up a jolly old row. Good God, Mr. Burns What on earth are you up to? What do you mean by coming up on deck in this state? Just that! Boldness. The only way to scare the old bullying rascal. - Captain! Sir! - Hold on to it! I think wind picks up. I can't see the upper sails, sir Don't move the helm. You'll be all right You are all right now, my man. All you've got to do is to keep the wind at the back of your head. A child could steer this ship in smooth water Aye! A healthy child. We have never had so much wind as this since we left the roads. There's some heart in it, too It was about time I should come on deck I've been nursing my strength for this Do you understand it, sir? Go below and rest! Go below? Not if I know it, sir. You don't know how to go about it, sir. How could you? You never heard him talk Enough to make your hair stand on end No! He wasn't mad He was no more mad than I am. He was just downright wicked. And do you think he's any different now because he's dead? Not he! His carcass lies a hundred fathom under but he's just the same... in latitude 8 d 20' north. I ought to have thrown the beggar out of the ship over the rail like a dog. It was only on account of the men... Fancy having to read the Burial Service over a brute like that! 'Our departed brother' I could have laughed. That was what he couldn't bear. I suppose I am the only man that ever stood up to laugh at him. Hallo! Calm again! This is the sort of thing we've been having for fourteen days, Mr. Burns A puff, then a calm, and in a moment, you'll see she'll be swinging on her heel with her head away from her course to the devil somewhere. Devil? The old dodging Devil, Who's that gone crazy, now? It's the mate. Lay hold of him a couple of you You've found your tongues-have ye? I thought you were dumb Well, then-laugh! Laugh-I tell you. Now then-all together. One, two, three! Laugh! I think he has fainted, sir Get hold of his legs, some one. Come aft somebody! I can't stand this Here she'll be off again directly and I can't How am I to steer her, sir? Dead before it for the present. I'll get you a light in a moment. You won't let me go when we come to the ladder? You manage to steer very well in these conditions. What does this mean? A hint to my predecessor? I do believe, sir, that his brain began to go a year or more before he died. What would you have me to do, Mr. Burns? We can neither furl it nor set it. I only wish the old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done with it. That beastly racket confuses me. How will you get the ship into harbour, sir, without men to handle her? This breeze seems to have done for our crowd It just laid them low-all hands Yes, I suppose you and I are the only two fit men in the ship. Take it. Frenchy says there's still a jump left in him I don't know. It can't be much Good little man that. But suppose, sir, that this wind flies round when we are close to the land what are we going to do with her? We close in with the land and we will either run ashore or get dismasted or both We won't be able to do anything with her. She's running away with us now. All we can do is to steer her. She's a ship without a crew. Yes. All laid low I do give them a look-in forward every now and then, but it's precious little I can do for them. Ransome! I, and the ship, and every one on board of her are very much indebted to you, Ransome I'm sure. Mr. Burns, Your laughter had done it! Forces of nature - take our side! Land! There's nobody dead in there, if that's what you want to know The whole crew! - And very bad? - And very bad. Heavens! What's that? That is Mr. Burns, my chief officer. Is he going to the hospital, too? Oh, no, Mr. Burns can't go on shore till the mainmast goes. I am very proud of him. He's my only convalescent. - You know, you look... - I am not ill. No... You look queer. Well, you see, I have been seventeen days on deck. Seventeen!... But you must have slept. I suppose I must have. I don't know. But I'm certain that I didn't sleep for the last forty hours. You will be going ashore presently I suppose?" As soon as ever I can. There's no end of business waiting for me there. I strongly advise you to get this prescription made up for yourself ashore. Unless I am much mistaken you will need it this evening - What is it, then? - Sleeping draught Yes, thank you very much. Do not let them drop me, sir! Don't let them drop me, sir. I beg your pardon sir but I would also like to sent ashore too Could I be pleased paid off as well? You don't mean to leave the ship? I do really, sir. I want to go and be quiet somewhere Anywhere. The hospital will do. I hate the idea of parting with you I must go I have the right! Of course I shall pay you off if you wish it Only I must ask you to remain on board till this afternoon I can't leave Mr. Burns absolutely by himself in the ship for hours. Yes, sir, I understand. Of course. What is it I hear? 21 days from Bangkok? Is this all you've heard? I want you to know exactly what you have let me in for, Captain Giles. You must feel jolly well tired by this time I'm not tired. No, not tired. But I'll tell you, Captain Giles, how I feel. I feel old. And I must be. All of you on shore look to me just a lot of skittish youngsters that have never known a care in the world That will pass. But you do look older - it's a fact. No! No! The truth is that one must not make too much of anything in life, good or bad Live at half-speed Not everybody can do that. You'll be glad enough presently if you can keep going even at that rate And there's another thing: a man should stand up to his bad luck to his mistakes, to his conscience and all that sort of thing. Why-what else would you have to fight against. Why-you aren't faint-hearted? God only knows, Captain Giles That's all right. You will learn soon how not to be faint-hearted A man has got to learn everything that's what so many of them youngsters don't understand Well, I am no longer a youngster No Are you leaving soon? I am going on board directly You will. that's the way. You'll do. What did you think? That I would want to take a week ashore for a rest? There's no rest for me till she's out in the Indian Ocean and not much of it even then Yes. That's what it amounts to. Precious little rest in life for anybody. Better not to think about it. It may be of some good to you when you leave the hospital How are you feeling now? I don't feel bad now, sir But I am afraid of it coming on I am in a blue funk about my heart, sir. Won't you shake hands, Ransome?
