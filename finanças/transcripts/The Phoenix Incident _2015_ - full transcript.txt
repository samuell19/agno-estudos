Scanning. PCB detected. Go, go, go, go! Go, go! They've been here before. Belgium, Osaka, Roswell, those were recon missions. They were testing our weakness... ...testing our capabilities... ...but Phoenix was different. How was it different? It was only the beginning. Run! Stop, stop! - Jesus Christ! - We gotta go, we gotta go! Go, go, come on! Come on, Jake. Come on, Jake. Sorry, if I'd known, I would have waited. Right, well... We got plenty of time. You know, we'll go down, we'll get to the other side. It'll be perfect. Come on, come on, come on! Pick it up! Jesus Christ! - Ryan, let's go! God! - Comin'? Do the John Williams. - Wow. - Right? Wow. You know how we're goin' down, right? We're gonna ride on Jake's ba... We're gonna push Jake down the side. You've done this before, right? Just slidin'? - ...ride you like an alpaca. - Like a Jake-paca. I'm serious. You can do it. Here, you go first. Come on, go first. You go. Camera, camera, camera, camera, camera! Four Phoenix area residents are missing tonight after a local camping trip in the Estrella Mountains. Despite the efforts of the Arizona County rescue, and the AHP, officials continue to scour the are by ground and in the air, but have found no sign of the missing hikers. The men were all experiences riders, and were in good health. Susan Lauder hasn't heard from her son, Glenn, since Thursday morning around 11 a.m. March 14th, 1997, authorities recover an abandoned A.T.V. belonging to 28-year-old Glenn Lauder. His food and water supplies are found less than 50 feet away, but Glenn is nowhere in the area. ...that provided the first real clues as to what may have happened to the four missing riders on March 14th. The individual committing these abductions was extremely methodical. The location of the disappearances led us to believe this was the work of a lone perpetrator operating in a specific part of the desert. New evidence has come to light linking the unexplained disappearances of four missing Arizona hikers... Sheriff's officials arrest Walton S. Gayson, a retired veteran and religious fanatic, with a long history of confrontations with police. The Phoenix District Attorney's office says Gayson was involved in a fourth aggravated assault where he attacked a Maricopa County sheriff's station. ...testimony from Walton S. Gayson, now the prime suspect, in what investigators believe may be a... ...four-person homicide. During interrogation, Gayson confesses he witnessed the men's abduction, but insisted the men were taken by non-terrestrial beings. But before Gayson can stand trial, Gayson is taken into federal custody and all information in the case is confiscated. ...the FBI will be reviewing the evidence. We'll be making a statement in the coming weeks. Thank you. Gayson absolutely committed these murders. There's no question in my mind. It was like we were being sabotaged by our own country. You think this was a conspiracy? Absolutely. Something happened out there in the desert. What do you think happened? We got too close to something much bigger and the military didn't want us to know. You're aware that by giving this interview they can come after you and your family? Yeah, I know. I know. Okay, you ready to do this? Yeah, let's go. In 1997, you took part in one of the largest military cover-ups in United States history. That's correct. And this involved the direct engagement with extra-terrestrial craft. That's correct. But the official Defense Department reports have never been disclosed. Congress doesn't even know that this happened. This began March 13th, 1997... ...during the single-most controversial U.F.O. sighting in North America... ...known as the Phoenix Lights. Hey, Sue! Take a look at this! The Phoenix Lights. Tonight, lights in the sky... ...are talking about one of the nation's largest U.F.O. sighting. There was a case... ...oh, a couple of years ago in Arizona of some lights that were seen over Arizona. Um, and that has never been fully explained. ...like a fleet of planes or helicopters flying in formation. The first reports of the strange flying object came in about 8:20 p.m. from a former police officer in Paulden, Arizona... Hundreds of eyewitnesses reported sightings... They've been here before. Belgium, Osaka, Roswell, those were recon missions... * ...but Phoenix was different. How was it different? This was the first time... ...we knew what they were capable of. The first time we'd been provoked into an attack, or maybe the first time they were. And as a result of this operation four civilian men became collateral damage. Yeah. I don't think a night's gone by in 17 years I haven't thought about what happened to those boys that night. All right, here's what I got. See here, I had to cannibalize a bunch of other cameras. They are wrecked, unfortunately. But... Yep, that's right. Hands-free, baby. And why hands-free, you ask. Let me show you. For this. Hyah! Right? Shit like this. Pow! Captain Fucking Magic, right? Uh, Glenn had mounted... ...this camera to the front of his bike. It actually went to his helmet, too. The best we could do at the time, you know. But it, like... He recorded everything. He managed to get every stunt way before GoPros, or, you know, any of the shit we have now. Glenn was, um... like, never scared of shit. He was just fearless. And you do realize how ridiculous you look in all this, right? You look ridiculous... Fuck you! He saved up his own money to buy his cameras. He'd film stunts, tricks... Anything you could film. He was pointing that thing as something. Fuck yeah! Woo! When they disappeared, it was... It was like life just stopped. They were so fun and... ...and full of life. You find me attractive. I think... That's my foot. And then they were just gone. Son of a bitch. Okay! You son of a bitch. Okay, hey. You are... the best... alarm clock of all. I know. All right, let's do this! It's D-Day, motherfuckers! Shut up. Shut up. Yeah, I got... I got everything we need. I don't wanna eat bologna and beer every day. No, I know. I know. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Where are we even fucking going? Look. Here, just... We're right here. Why do we even have to go that far? Why can't we just, like, hit a bar, or... I'm not taking you to the Nam, or anything. I just don't wanna get bit by a fucking rattlesnake. Look, I'm doing this as much for you as I am for him. Yeah, I hear you! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey! Jake, you're looking good, buddy. Where's Ryan? What? He's still asleep. Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, I know. No, I fucked it up on that last jump. - Why? - It's not gonna zoom anymore. Oh, shit. It'll be fine, though. I just can't zoom. It'll be great. Oh, man, if we don't get out of here this day it's because of you. You. What's the problem? The zipper's stuck. No, it's not. Hold on. Smells like victory. Leather! It's so good. So good. Out, out, out! No, no, no, no! One, two, three! After you. I'm locking up. Oh, thank you, darling. I mean, for years... ...they told us it was over. They couldn't explain the reports, the bone fragments, the lack of evidence... No one would help us. I mean, if- if our boys are dead, where are the bodies? You guys look great. No parent should have to outlive their kid. We just wanna know... what happened to our boys. * What? By coming forward with this information now you risk exposing a military operation that lead to the disappearance of these four men. How did you become involved with this event? In 1997 I was stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona, as part of a Special Operations aerial unit. In the weeks leading up to the incident had you experienced any warning signs about an impending attack? There were... ...reports of livestock mutilations and things of that nature. On our side of the spectrum, we had experienced, uh, atmospheric anomalies about 50 clicks west of the ranch. This is in the area where the four men were abducted? That's right. But there was no other indication of an attack or an invasion? No. No, not at that time. And, leading up to the incident, were you or your superiors aware of the four civilian men prior to that night? No, we were not. Walton Gayson? No. Were you aware that the men had been recording themselves? Did you-did you know that the footage existed? Not at that time. I have subsequently become aware of that. W.W.F. brother! Motherfucker! - Balls! - What is that? Sweaty balls! What... No, no! What's that?! - What? - No, no, under your shirt! Ryan! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan! No, no, no, no! Come here, come here, come here! Come on, get off! Get off! - Get off! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God, dude! - What the hell is that? - All right, all right. Jesus. You fuckin' happy? Shit. What happened? Krissy wanted it. - So?! - What? Did you guys get matching tattoos?! When did you get that? Couple of months ago. - After you got divorced? - After?! She was-she was scared. I didn't want her to go alone. So you fucking went with her?! Are you nuts?! You're so [indistinct], Jake! I didn't want her to be scared. Just fuckin' leave it. - Leave it. - Aw, you're so sweet! He gets a hug. He gets a hug! Oh, my God. It's so good. It's the best thing I've ever seen! Sit in my lap, Captain Sweaty Balls. At that time, Hale-Bopp was making its approach to the northwest. 0430, NorComm, El Paso reported... ...a triangular shape... ...that was trailing behind the comet's tail. Did you know what the object was? They referred to it as a chevron, but no, nobody knew what the hell it was. At 0700, there was traffic about a separation. The object had been following the comet until... ...1.32 aeronautical units, at which time, it began... ...a break-off and a rapid descent into our atmosphere. And was there any indication where it was heading? Yeah, somewhere over Arizona. This is how it begins! We'll have to stop for gas first. Whoa! Hello... We should take those. Yeah? - Yeah. - Beautiful, right? Here, take-take-take it. I gotta show you something. Come on, man, I thought you were ready to go. Ready? Ready? It's just like the best thing I've ever seen. No, it's not! Mitch was a good kid. He didn't deserve any of this. Well, the family took the disappearance really hard, especially since... ...Mitch's brother Mark, he, uh... ...died in a helicopter crash, '92... ...a few years after the Gulf War. You know, that's why I think Mitch and Glenn had that special bond. I think, you know, growing up around military, they... ...they were like family, you know, they... ...they were close. They were really tight-knit, and once Mark passed on, definitely more so, I think, like, Glenn became like a brother to Mitch. * Don't big brother him right now. Be nice. Just gotta be nice. Look, I'm being-I'm being nice, 'cause I'm telling him that he's brilliant. So, why aren't you painting? You never paint. I do paint. How come you don't make music? If you're- If you're all a musician? This is not about me, this is about him. Why don't you make music? - I do make music. - You know what? He doesn't have to make music, 'cause he dresses like he makes music, and that's the important part. You know, the difference is... ...is I'm gonna be a librarian that faints... ...your gonna fucking go to L.A. and you're gonna... ...you know, we're gonna listen to you on the radio. You know, you're my best friend, but you need to get the fuck away from me and get the hell out of here. You know? You said I was your best friend. Only on Sunday nights. All right, run. Keep running... all the way to the coast. Commercial break is... If you don't- if you don't come back, we know you've gone to Los Angeles to be a rock and roll star. Dude. Turn the fucking camera off, man. You just fuckin' ran out of there. Turn the fucking camera off, please. What's your fuckin' problem? Fuck that guy, dude. I love him, I know... He's doing it because he loves you, man. No, he's not. The only reason why he... Because we want you to... I get it. I get it. But I don't need to hear from Jake, who can't get over his wife, who won't take his fucking wedding ring off, that I need to change my life, and that I need to do something with him. Why doesn't he get off his ass and do anything? That's his problem. It is his problem, but I don't need to be... I know what I'm doing with my life, and at least... at least out of the four of us... I've got-I've got a plan to do something. I'm not just sitting on my ass, and-and... I don't know, dude. You can't just... I'm willing to do... I'll pack everything that I have in the back of my car and fucking drive, and I'll get there. And I'll pump gas, I'll paint houses. I don't give a shit what I have to do. Well, just... There is a side of me that just doesn't wanna leave. I mean, I dunno. I mean, I'm certainly not one to talk. I know. I'm good. You don't believe Gayson acted alone? When you're doing a criminal investigation, you look at every possibility, and then you consider the impossible. The impossible was that four healthy young men could've been overpowered, abducted and murdered by a single individual. We have a very limited time that we get to talk to each other, so, uh... ...I would kinda like to get to some questions that I have. I've been wanting to ask you for quite a while... So, if you don't mind, are you ready to, uh... Ready to begin? You don't wanna shake hands first? I don't think we're allowed to actually touch each other, Mr. Gayson, but I appreciate the offer. Courtesy. Why did your department release Gayson after the incident? We're following protocol. We investigate the case, we investigate the leads... ...we hit a dead end. Yeah, but you had a suspect in custody. We had a suspect who... ...said that he witnessed the men in the area, but there wasn't enough evidence to hold him. So you're saying your department released the last person to see the men alive. No one took him seriously. He was a bit of a... a bit of a... ...a bit unstable. History paints a picture of me... you... Say I was the monster that took them... The simple truth is I wasn't the real monster. I didn't fuckin' feel it at first. - Really? - Because of the shock. Yeah, and then I looked down, the branch is literally sticking through my thigh. You always laugh when you get hurt. Whoa. ...your Frankenstein helmet rig thing? Yeah, yeah, get it- get it the back. Get it the back. Record button's on the side. Mash it and start recording. You'll be the first man on Earth to film his own death. Well done. - Pretty cool little thing. - Yeah. - You like that? - What's up? Hey, how's it going? Hey guys, something's going on over there. Whoa, what's up? - Check it out. - What's going on? What is it? What's up? By 0900, multiple atmospheric distortions began appearing across the state. In the same position as the previous sightings. That's right. Uh, the Nevada border, Paulden and Flagstaff. Those were the same warning indicators that happened in Russia and Syria. We had two birds in the air, but there were no other... ...confirmed contacts, except for the formation. - Whoa. - Oh, shit. - What is that? - That's not normal. - Damn it! - Fuck! What the fuck?! - God damn it. - Get out and check it, Jake. - What did you hit? - I didn't do anything! God damn it! - You gonna look at this? - Yeah, I'm on it. You ever put oil in this thing? - Fuck you. - Yeah. How far is it to your folks' place, man? We could walk it. No, no, it's like, at least 15 miles or more. I mean, I don't even know where we are out here. I don't think Triple A is gonna come out this far. Yeah, well, I don't think anybody's coming out this far. I'm sorry, guys. This is my fault. No, listen, don't worry about it, look. We'll try and find a phone and see if... ...if anybody's there we can call for help. Yeah? I'll stay here and see if I cant at least get it running, or something. I'll just... You know, I'll get it patched up if I can. Meet us back here. All right? Jake, you're... Yeah? Yeah, we're good. Dude, she's a big girl. She'll be fine. Well, I don't like it. Wooh! Yeah! ...his nut sweat stain was, like, a third the size of yours, which makes no sense at all. - It was cold! - You remember that? He's like, "No, my nuts just aren't as sweaty! That's why!" "It just looks smaller!" Shut up. He starts screamin', "I was in the pool! I was in the pool!" Were the four men aware of the impending operation? Do you think they had any idea of what was about to happen? You've asked me some form of that question two or three times now... ...and I've already given you the answer. They didn't know. We didn't know. That's it. That's not gonna change. Tire... ...and tired. Okay... Hey, don't touch the fence. I think it's electric. You think? You think this thing's on? I hope it's not on. I just picture a fat serial killer on the other end. Shut up. So what was the official cause of death? They said that Ryan... ...had been attacked... by some kind of an animal. The coroner... ...said that they thought they found what... ...were his remains. Police say the remains of the four men have yet to be identified, however, officials are classifying this as... ...an animal attack, believing the men may have become victims... ...the March 14th, 1997 attacks, where four hikers disappeared in the Estrella Sierra... ...following the coroner's announcement, the Country Attorney's office has suspended further investigation into the men's disappearance. How many bodies did you recover? There were no bodies... ...no tissue residue... ...not even D.N.A. could be recovered from the site. So, in your opinion... ...could this have been a bear? No. Absolutely not. Everyone knew Gayson would never testify, so the medical examiner was instructed to classify the event as a bear attack. The families never had any resolution to what happened to their kids. Despite public criticism of the medical examiner's announcement, the County Attorney's office as suspended further investigation into the men's disappearance. Giving up over here, or what? I guarantee you he has never put oil in this car. He can barely wipe his own ass, how can he make it in L.A.? What's with you? You guys used to be best friends. I'll take that. I've had enough of this. I'm gonna go try to find some help, - like that road over there. - Are you sure? Yeah, it's not that far. - All right. - I'll be back. - Be careful, all right? - I will. I don't want Mitch to put me in the ground. Great. Great. By 1100 hours, NorComm had lost visual with the object. Within 30 minutes, we had lost two KA-12 satellites over the southwestern hemisphere. They were entering our atmosphere. There were conflicting reports... It was a fucking mess. Nobody knew what they were looking for or where to look. Well, Glenn, congratulations, 'cause we are pretty fucked out here. Uh, Ryan's car is out of commission, so... ...we're stuck... ...and... ...there isn't shit for miles. And judging by the look of that shack you guys just headed off for, I'm gonna guess you're about to be chopped up into hamburger meat, so... ...let me just go on the record and say, "I told you so." You know, this whole trip just... ...great fuckin' idea. You need to leave! You need to leave now! Were you with the men the night they disappeared? I warned 'em... ...but they came back. You need to leave! You shouldn't be here! Fuck. Authorities claim you were responsible for the disappearance of those men. That you had never spoken about any military operation that night. Get away from my car! If you say so. Why not come forward... ...and expose the truth? I've made peace with my Lord... ...and He shall grant me forgiveness. I can't say the same for you. Oh, Jesus! Open the fucking door! - Take it easy. - Where did he go? - Jake... - Where'd he go?! - Fucking guy right here. - What the fuck are you doing?! I'm serious. There was some fucking psychopath banging on the fucking car! - Hey, relax, Ryan... - I think I just peed a little. - I didn't see anybody. Did you? - What happened? Why don't you just own up to the fact that you were beatin' off in there? Look, can we get back on the A.T.V.s? Sorry to disturb you. All right? I mean, if we can expose a conspiracy, then none of this needs to happen again. It is happening. I think people believe what they want to believe, but in my heart I know Gayson killed those men. They come, they take, they feed. They have no pity... ...no remorse. Their vision is pure. See ya later. Pick you up later tonight! Those boys found something out here, something no one was supposed to see. They police, they just... They didn't wanna say what. What do you think they found? The truth. And then you received a call to stop the investigation? Can you shut that off? Our department... was told to back down by the Air Force Investigative Commission. We have recovered circumstantial evidence of possible connection to an incident... We received a call... ...and they told us to suspend all search and rescue operations in the Estrella region, so that's what we did. You were told, essentially, to back off. Yes. Well, would you say that that was unusual for the military to intervene in a missing persons investigation? Yeah. I'd say that's very unusual. I was told, "Don't ask any more questions." And that's kind of where it ended. This... was not about a bear... ...or even about investigating Gayson... You believe they were covering something up. It was a distraction... ...to keep people from knowing the truth. Look, no one talks about what happened that night. At this point you were at DEFCON 2? At 1730, the 104th reported multiple bogies descending into Nevada airspace. 911. What is your emergency? They're in the sky! They're all over! Excuse me, sir? What is your emergency? Look out the window. It's a whole fucking fleet! Sir, I need you to calm down and tell me what's happening. It's a fucking invasion! - Look at 'em all! - I got that one on video. When they made an abrupt turn to the south... ...law enforcement and civilians had already seen it. There was no way to isolate or contain it. We couldn't respond in time. ...major sighting here. Well, our newsroom has been flooded with calls tonight... ...reports from all across the state of mysterious flying objects in the sky... ...in what many are already calling the largest U.F.O. sighting in North America. There were so many phone calls coming in from the City and the County, and people were concerned that this object could've been a threat. It passed over our airport, it passed over the towers, the buildings, and nobody was doing anything about it. I don't care what nobody's talkin' about, man! Those were aliens like E.T. Aliens, man! ...panicked 911 calls, reports to local authorities, airport officials were prompted to temporarily suspend flights as the strange lights crossed over Sky Harbor airspace. Air traffic controllers had been notified by Luke Air Force Base authorities, and numerous reports from nearby residents confirm the base had scrambled F-15s shortly after the sightings. We were tracking them for about 90 minutes, coming in from Nevada. As soon as they entered our airspace we scrambled two 15s... ...but... ...the 104th was already engaged over that area. Engaged? Yeah, they had encountered them over the Barry Goldwater Range, and evaded them to the south... ...until we could intercept. That's when Operation Snowbird went into effect. Don't worry, baby. I'll snuggle up and keep you warm. Quit jerkin' off with your toys. Geek. I see 'em, dude. What the fuck, man? I mean, look at 'em. They're all in a... They look like they're in a line. - What are you guys looking at? - You're fucking retarded. You know that, right? Look, look, look, look. They're coming this way. Jesus. That... That's a U.F.O. Not a U.F... Those are flares, dude. Flares from what? Shh, shh, shh. Listen. Huh, you hear 'em? You hear the A-10s? Yeah, yeah, he can hear 'em. - What are they doing out here? - Must be part of that operation we saw this morning. Yeah, they've been doing maneuvers over the desert all day. Oh, dude. Check it, check it, check it. Look, look, look. You see 'em? The two A-10s? That's not it... Those are 15s! - Oh, shit, those are 15s! - Look how fast they're goin'! Wow! Why are they dropping' flares? Are they chasin' something? Maybe it's an exercise or a training-training something. At nine o'clock at night? Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen 15s do maneuvers over a city in what... like, forever. Why here? Why aren't they down by the base? I dunno. You know what this means, right? - We're fucking going up there. - No, no. - We are going up there. - Absolutely not! Let's go! We are doing this, baby! - Absolutely not, dude. - What?! Come on! We don't know what that is. We don't even know where the hell we are right now! I mean, we should just stay here or go home. Melissa's fucking waiting on us anyway. No, he's got a point, listen. Whatever shit is going on over there, we do not need to be fucking with it. Are you kidding me? You wanna go home, Jake? Would you quit hiding from stuff? Please stop being such a fucking pussy. I'm not being a fucking pussy. I just font think we should be fucking around out here. I just have a bad feeling about this. I think we should go home right now. - No! - It's just some planes! Yeah, in like two minutes they're gonna be gone. You're telling me that those are flares dropped from fighter jets and you wanna go closer? I mean, what if it's the fuckin' Russians or something? It's not the Russians! What are you talking about?! Look, look, look. I swear... ...I will get you the best blow job ever, just please come with me. All right? We'll go up there, we'll come back down. It'll take ten minutes. You're going. You are going. Yes? - Fuckin A, man. - Yes, he's going! He's going, and you're going too, baby! Let's do it! This is gonna be fucking great! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Lieutenant Colonel James Edwards, now the Assistant Director of Operations for the 175th Operations Group in Maryland, says his squadron of A-10 Warthogs was on a training exercise over the Barry Goldwater Range. So you're saying the lights that people witnessed were flares? Most likely they were our illumination parachute flares. Is that unusual to drop flares over a populated area? We were miles from any civilian areas. It was standard procedure to drop... ...unused ordinance after a run. I still don't know what it was. As a pilot and a former Air Force officer, I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object that I had ever seen, and it was certainly not high-altitude flares as put out by the, uh, the Air Force at Luke air Force Base 'cause I've never seen flares fly in formation. There are about five or six craft. Uh... We were tracking their progress for about ten more minutes. And when they passed over the city they broke south for Tucson. What changed? Well, after what happened in, uh... ...Belgium and Osaka, we-we... ...sure as hell weren't gonna take any chances. What kind of chances? Move! Let's go! Move it! Let's go! Are you guys hearing this? - Oh, man! - Did you see that shit?! We should just turn around. - Freaking me out. - Have you ever seen anything like this? What's going on? What's that one behind that one over there? I don't know. It's not a 15. You're fucking A right. It's moving too fast. Look, they're dropping their flares. We should fucking get out of here. Two of our F-15s approached them from the North. One of our birds attempted to make contact with the lead craft... ...and the other objects instantly aggressed from the hail. We have an E-3 in the air covering with FLIR. We could see 'em on visual. They were completely invisible to radar. I was passed some information that said this was Operation Snowbird. The information this man gave me was code names, and Snowbird was diversion. Can you tell us specifically what Operation Snowbird is? In the event of a mass-sighting or an engagement over a civilian-populated area, Operation Snowbird would deploy deterrent measures and diversionary tactics to... draw eyes away from the combat zone. A distraction operation? Yeah. So when the public saw the lights over the city, they weren't seeing the actual crafts? No. No, they were seeing our flares. Is it unusual to drop flares over a populated area? I've already stated that we... Look, as Lieutenant Colonel Jones stated in his report, the events of March 13 were a documented training exercise with the 104th Fighter Squadron. Is it unusual that A-10s from another base would violate your airspace without first contacting your flight controller? Lieutenant Colonel Jones and his men were well within their area of operation. And does this include Operation Snowbird as a diversion exercise over the Estrella Mountains? All right, we're going to end this interview now. At 2200 hours... ...they cleared the mountain line... ...and that lead craft... ...changed trajectory... ...and engaged our fighters head-on. So what was going through your mind? I had never seen anything move so fast in my life. Warning. Warning. I don't think so. I mean, they're not supposed to be able to move like that. Look, look, look, look, look, look! Whoa! - What the fuck was that?! - What the hell was that?! What was that? Oh my God, man. That's a pilot. Well, why did we shoot it down? Come on, we gotta go. - What are you doing?! - Enough. Listen, dude. Everybody on. Everybody on! Where the fuck is it?! It was this way! Somewhere over here! Come on! They're looking in the wrong place! Come on! - Can you see it?! - It's on that mountain! It's right over there! Look! Mitch... Wait, hang on, hang on. Get down, get down. - We need to turn around right fucking now. - Just hang on a second. It's a fucking pilot. We can't leave him. Listen to him, man. He's right. Okay, you've had your fun. Let's get the fuck out... Look, if that is one of ours... ...I'm not gonna leave him here. You understand? One of ours? What are you even talking about, dude? If that's one of ours, if that's military, then someone's comin' after him. There's nobody else up here! All right? This is our chance to save him. We don't know what the hell that is. Just gonna see if he's okay. All right? If he's fine, we'll go back down, we'll get some help, all right? It'll be fine! Who's fine?! Who are you talking about?! The pilot, man! God, he needs us! Okay, listen, no... Nobody needs us, and this is not the time for you to play hero, okay? - What are you worried about?! - What am I worried about?! I'm worried about him going up there and getting us all fucking killed where we shouldn't be in the first fucking place! Listen, Mark is not up there, okay? What the fuck did you say to me?! I'm gonna save his fucking life! You wanna be a fucking baby?! Fine! Sack of shit! Fuck you, Ryan! Fuck! We've gotta go. Get the fuck off me! Come on, he's right. Let's go. This is bullshit, okay? You're gonna leave him up there alone?! Come on! Man, this doesn't make any sense. Doesn't make any fucking sense. - Come on! - Mitch! Mitch! Ryan, man, Ryan! They were scared. We're talking about... ...best trained pilots in the world, best equipment in the world... Doesn't matter. We were not prepared for anything like this. Nobody is. Can we fucking go now? Come on, Jake, a little further, buddy. - Hey, you good? - Yeah. - Shh. - Shut the fuck up. That's gotta be one of our jets, man. Did you guys see an ejection, or anything? - No. - No, nothing. Shut the fuck up. Come on. Mitch, no, no, no, no! - Mitch! - You stay here. Mitch! What the fuck is that thing!? There was no heat signature. Our E-3 controllers were unable to find the crash site for 28 minutes. By the time we did find the location... ...it was too late. Mitch! Shit, shit, shit! Mitch! Come on, if they knew they were trapped, wouldn't they have... wouldn't they have done something about it? This is the U.S. Military, for Christ's sakes. They can do anything they want. Go, Jake! Mitch! Mitch! Jake! - Jake! - Jake! Jake! Oh, my God, dude. His leg is fucked, man! Take it easy, take it easy. Jake, listen, buddy, you're gonna be all right. You're gonna be okay. Let's just get him up on one of the bikes, okay? I don't think that's a good idea. What about those things?! I don't know! Come on, Jake. We gotta go, we gotta go. Buddy, come on! Come on. Come on, Jake. Come on, buddy. What the fuck is going on, Mitch?! Move! We gotta go faster. Come on! Guys, come on! Follow me! Down here. Down here, come on. Come on, let's get... Shh, shh, shh. Okay. All right. Hold on. Let's stay here for a second. We never shouldn't fucking come here. I know. I'm sorry, buddy. We gotta get out of here. Listen to me. Just hang in there, all right? We're gonna get through this. I'm sorry, buddy. We gotta keep moving, though. Okay? Can you walk? I don't know, man. I don't know. Jesus. Uh, all right, listen. It's either stay, all right, and wait for the sun, or we try for it. It's up to you. What are we doin' here, Mitch? Just... just let me think for a second. I think they gave up! I think we can make a run for it! Did you see how many there were? Are you fucking crazy? They are fucking hunting us! * We've got four civilians heading in 203. Multiple contacts north of their position. We gotta go! We gotta go! Over here! Over here! Where's that light comin' from?! I dunno, maybe... Maybe it's a house! Shit. It's the same house from this morning! Shit. It's the same fucking house from this morning! I know it is! What else are we gonna do?! I wish I could share the pain I live with every day. The shame... ...I feel when I look at myself in the mirror. I've prayed... God, I've prayed... I'm not ready... ...for the kingdom of Heaven. There's only... one savior... ...waiting for me. Hey! Hey! Mitch, they're close! Come on! Come on, come on! Come on! Jesus, come on! They're coming! Oh, Jesus! - Open the gate! - Open the gate! - Open the gate! - Open the fucking gate! They're right behind us! I don't wanna die out here! It's open! It's open! Get inside! Get inside! Help me bar the fucking door! Oh, my God, guys. We have got to get Jake to a hospital. Where's the fucking phone? Where's the fucking phone?! Well, we can't stay here. We gotta find some help. Listen, listen, whatever took thatching down, if it's Military, someone's gonna come looking for it, right? You wanna stay here and wait for them to get here? What are we gonna do about Jake? We just leave him. What? What the fuck are you talking about?! - We can't just leave him here! - Well, what do you want me to do?! I'm not staying here until those things come in here and tear us apart! You understand me?! Oh, shit! Fuck! The fuck is that? Who the fuck is this guy? Shit. I know we're trespassing here, but... ...we got these things out there chasin' us. Listen, man, we have to find a phone. Our friend is hurt real bad. Please help him. Please. Please. Please. Hey, look, I think there's some kind of a misunderstanding. If you could just let us wait here for a while and we can stay here until somebody can come and help us. Please. What the fuck, man?! What the fuck did you just do?! ...did you open those gates?! You son of a bitch! We gotta move! Come on, let's move! We can't stay here! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Guys... he's losing a lot of blood, man. We gotta stop this bleeding. God damn it! The fuck?! Oh, shit. Yeah, that'll work. I got two. I got two. Here. Here, catch. Mitch... I'm sorry for what I said about Mark, man. I didn't mean it. Okay? I know, man. I'm sorry about Melissa. I'm sorry I porked your mom. My God, I wish it was the Russians. Okay, it's gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Then why did the men return to the house? Geographically, it was the only place within miles of them. It was the only safe port in the storm. And other than those men... ...the public had no idea what was happening. They were the only ones up there and we couldn't risk anyone compromising the operation. You got it? - You got it, man? - Yes, I fucking got it! Come on. - We gotta get out. - No, no! You have no idea. Turn the fucking light off. It's in the house. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh! Turn... the power... back on. I don't. Jesus! Fuck you! Fuck you! What are those things?! What are they doing with Jacob?! Tell me, what do they want?! Engaging. Engaging. Once we were able to mark their position, our S.A.R. teams were still about 15 minutes out. You could see the men were getting ripped apart, and... ...and we had no choice. We had to do it. We had to attack. Someone's trying to kill us, man! Who?! They're bombing us! Shut up! If you don't fucking help me I will end you! Where's more ammo?! - Watch him. - No, Mitch! - Mitch, get back here! - Mitch, wait! There's a light up there. Oh, shit. Go through this. He's got cameras everywhere. He's been watching us the whole fucking time. Shit. There's gotta be something we can use. Mitch! - Yeah, keep it. - Okay. Shit. They led us here. He's helping them! Guys! That's Jake. Hey, hey, Mitch. Ryan! Ryan, this is you. You got my back. I'm going after Jake. Come on. Come here. - Come on, let's move! - Mitch, wait! Mitch! Ryan! Let him go! Please! Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You okay? Come on, get up! Get up. Come on. Come on, Ryan. Let's go. Where did he go?! Where the fuck did he go?! Come on, let's go! Over here! Ryan, come on, let's go! Go, go! I'm gonna go out the front, get Jake. You two go out the back, get to the A.T.V.s. I'll meet you there. Okay? Come here, listen. I can do this. All right? I got it. I'm way faster without you two bitches, anyway. All right, first one there gets the A.T.V. fucking haul ass and get some help. - Okay? - Okay, okay. We can do this. Let's go. Mitch! We could see 'em on scope. There was nothing else we could do for 'em. It was the worst thing I have ever seen. Roger that. We have one... - We got a friendly down. One friendly down. Confirmed. - We have one friendly down. - Okay. Ryan! Come on. Let's go, come on! - Get to the fucking house! - Ryan! Go! Go! Ryan! Ryan! Go! Don't fucking stop! Go, go! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! They found us! We got two civilian friendlies exiting the structure. And roger that. We got 'em. Hold that position. Hey! Hey! Down here! Down here! We're gettin' out of here, Glenn! We're here! Hey! Ryan? What are you doing? Run. Run! Ryan! About two weeks after the... ...incident, a captain from Davis-Monthan made overtures toward the press. Apparently he was gonna bring this story to their attention. About 72 hours later, they found he and his A-10 aircraft crashed into the side of a Colorado mountainside. Pentagon said it was... ...an equipment malfunction and gross pilot error. Nobody came forward after that. * Do you believe the men were taken by aliens? I'm not tellin' you what I think. I'm telling you what I know. * He was 28 when they disappeared. Glenn would've been... ...43 years old next month. And the official medical examiner report still lists the incident as an animal attack? That monster took my son. He knew what he did, and they're just as guilty as he is for not telling us. And then it was over... They just closed the case. It was like no one would help us... ...or even acknowledge they existed. Their case was never brought to my attention, and when I asked about the incident I was told, "No more questions." And now I'll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party. The bottom line is they lied to us. Trying to hide the facts to fit their version of what happened. Look... Our goals are the same as the families'. To find answers. Now, as a parent, I sympathize with them, but... ...in this case there's simply not enough evidence that this was anything but an animal attack or some kids who got caught up in a cult. ...amateur photographer was camping in the Estrella Mountain Range south of the I-10 Highway. Along with him, his three friends. Mitch Adams... ...anyone with information about their possible whereabouts is encouraged to contact the Arizona Missing Database or call 1-855-2FIND-THEM, and remember, the call is anonymous. * It is 8:15, the night of March 13th, 1997, and suddenly, over the skies of Paulden, Arizona... ...what is described as a giant, brightly-lit boomerang soars through the air, slowly and silently. Just 15 minutes later, that same U.F.O. is spotted by thousands of people over the Phoenix area. People report seeing it, pilots report seeing it in the air, yet military radar screens pick up nothing. If those boys are dead... ...where the fuck are their bodies? Where the fuck... ...are their bodies? * Okay... Hello. My name is Walt Gayson... ...and my joyous day has finally come. My brothers and sisters have all... ...risen above this world and left their vehicles behind. But today... it's my turn. ...to follow the chosen ones... ...to the kingdom of Heaven. It is time.
