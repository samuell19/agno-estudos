SOME KIND OF A PROBLEM? THESE STUDENTS WERE JUST LEAVING. YOU, GET OUT. SAY, WATCH THAT. I SAID, GET OUT. SHIT. AND YOU, LET'S GO. I THINK WE'LL GET ALONG JUST FINE. WE'RE HERE AT BROOKLYN'S 77th ANNUAL HOT DOG EATING CONTEST. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE CONTESTANTS COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ARE CLEARLY INTO THE COMPETITION. THE WINNER RECEIVES A WHOLE YEAR'S SUPPLY OF HOT DOGS, BUT, BEST OF ALL, GETS TO CARRY HOME THAT KING WIENER TROPHY. I'M JUDY BURKE, REPORTING FROM CONEY ISLAND. THAT'S A WRAP. GOOD SHOW. DEFINITELY AN EMMY. YEAH. HI. THIS IS JUDY AT CONEY. TELL MURRAY IT'LL BE THERE FOR EDITING BY 6:00. THANKS. WHAT ARE YOU SO MAD ABOUT? I'M TIRED OF THIS. I DIDN'T SPEND 4 YEARS AT SYRACUSE SO I COULD COVER HOT DOG EATING CONTESTS AND DOG GROOMING SHOWS. I FEEL LIKE I'M WORKING FOR GODDAMN ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. BUT, JUDY, BE HAPPY. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE READING THE WEATHER. IF I WANTED TO BE HAPPY, RONNIE, I'D MARRY SOME RICH LAWYER, AND I'D WORK OUT ALL DAY. THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON HERE, RONNIE, THAT WE JUST DON'T REPORT. LOOK AT THIS. I REMEMBER COMING HERE EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER SCHOOL WITH MY FRIENDS, AND NOW NO DECENT PARENT WILL LET THEIR KID COME WITHIN A MILE OF THIS PLACE. AND ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR-- HOT DOGS AND WIENERS. COME HERE. SIR, MAY I SPEAK TO YOU ON-CAMERA FOR A FEW MOMENTS? SURE. WHY NOT? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING IN CONEY ISLAND? I WAS HERE WHEN THEY BUILT THE PLACE. IN THOSE DAYS, WE HAD THE NICKEL HOT DOG, STEEPLECHASE, LUNA PARK, JUST LIKE DISNEYLAND TODAY. THE WHOLE CITY WOULD BE HERE ON THE WEEKEND. PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WOULD STOP BY. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HERE OVER THE YEARS? THE BLACKS AND PUERTO RICANS STARTED MOVIN' IN. IT DESTROYED THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHITE FOLKS STARTED PANICKING AND SLOWLY MOVING AWAY, AND WITH THEM WENT THE TOURIST TRADE. YEAH. IT'S TOUGH MAKING A DOLLAR TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. HEY, BABY, YOU COMIN' MY WAY? NO. OH, COME ON. DON'T BE LIKE THAT. I GOT SOME STUFF TO DO, ALL RIGHT? YO! SEE YOU TONIGHT, RIGHT? OH, NO, NO, NO. HOW ABOUT ME? NO.

THE PRETTY ONES DON'T NEED LAW SCHOOL. THEY GO INTO BROADCASTING. OH, REALLY? YOU CAN COME VISIT ME AT THE STATION. BIG PROFESSIONAL LADY. OOH, JEALOUS, JEALOUS, JEALOUS. YOU DISH IT, YOU TAKE IT. YOU CAN GO AND LIVE ON THE STREET, FOR ALL I CARE! BUT I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'! YO! WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE? YOU STAY OUTTA THIS, ALL RIGHT? YOUR SISTER GOT HERSELF SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL FOR A WEEK! FOR WHAT? SCHWANNA, WHAT'D YOU DO THIS TIME? THEY CAUGHT HER SMOKIN' THIS. Michael: HEY, LOOK, WHAT YOU NEED THAT STUFF FOR? FOR THIS, I WORK ALL NIGHT AND ALL DAY, TENDIN' SICK PEOPLE AND EMPTYIN' BEDPANS, AND MY OWN DAUGHTER'S GOOFING OFF IN THE SCHOOL BATHROOM! I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SCHOOL, AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO! IT'S MY LIFE! THEN GO AND LIVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE! MAYBE I WILL! WHAT DO I GET HERE ANYWAY?! YOU'RE NEVER HOME WHEN I COME HOME. YOU DON'T COOK SUPPER ANYMORE. IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS SOME TYPE OF BEVERLY HILLS MANSION OR SOMETHING! WE GOT COCKROACHES AND BUGS CRAWLIN' ALL OVER THE FLOOR! WE GOT THINGS CRAWLIN' AROUND THAT GOD AIN'T EVEN NEVER HEARD OF. GET OUT! THAT'S RIGHT! GET OUT! MY PLEASURE! DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE WEDDING NEXT WEEK. Judy: MOM, I'M NOT GOING. WHY NOT? IT'S YOUR SECOND COUSIN'S WEDDING. HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO BE WITH THE FAMILY? THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO THAT WEDDING. THOSE PEOPLE ARE SO DIFFERENT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES. I WOULD FEEL VERY OUT OF PLACE. WHY? THEY COME TO ALL OUR AFFAIRS. YEAH. IT'S EMBARRASSING. SORRY TO SAY, MA, BUT YOUR SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS ALL WHACKED OUT. WISH THEY WERE MORE LIKE DAD'S FAMILY. YOU'RE ONE TO TALK ABOUT FAMILY. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START ONE OF YOUR OWN? MA, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. YEAH. I MEAN, CAN I FINISH LAW SCHOOL FIRST? Judy: I'M NOT READY TO START HAVING A FAMILY RIGHT NOW. WE'RE BOTH VERY BUSY NOW. OH, BUSY, BUSY, BUSY. THAT'S ALL I HEAR FROM YOU. WHAT ABOUT ME? I TOLD YOU TO MOVE OUT OF THIS PLACE A LONG TIME AGO. DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU'RE LONELY. I'M NOT LONELY, AND WHERE I LIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. OH, DAMN, IT'S BEEN IN OVER 3 HOURS, AND IT STILL DIDN'T COOK THROUGH. I ASKED JULIO 10 TIMES TO FIX THAT OVEN, AND THE JEWISH LANDLORDS DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT US. ANY PROBLEMS IN THE BUILDING? NO. NOTHING I'VE HEARD ABOUT. NOBODY OVERDOSE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS? OH, STEVEN, GOD! COME ON, MOM! LOOK WHAT THE BLACKS DID TO THIS PLACE. USED TO BE GORGEOUS, THE NICEST BUILDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WELL, NOW LOOK AT IT. IT'S A JUNGLE. IT'S ALL RUNDOWN AND FALLING APART. I MEAN, I REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE WOULD DIE JUST TO MOVE IN HERE. NOW THEY'RE JUST PLAIN DYING. I KNOW EVERYONE THAT LIVES HERE. THEY'RE DECENT, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AND SURVIVE. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY'RE NOT SO INTELLIGENT. THESE JEWS COME IN HERE, AND THEY BUY UP ALL THE BUILDINGS, AND THEN THEY LEAVE US TO ROT! ALL THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS COLLECTING THEIR RENT ON TIME. BUT, MA, THEY WERE HERE BEFORE WE EVEN MOVED IN. YEAH, BUT ONCE WE MOVE IN, THEY PANIC AND MOVE OUT. OF COURSE EVERYONE MOVED OUT! I MEAN, THEY BRING IN THE DRUGS, BOOZE, PROSTITUTES. LOOK HOW THEY WRECK THE APARTMENTS. WHY SHOULD ANYONE STAY? WHITE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HIRE US! AND WHEN THEY DO, IT'S TO SWEEP THEIR FLOORS OR PARK THEIR CARS. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A JEW WORKING IN A CAR WASH? WHAT ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION? DON'T BELIEVE THAT HOAX! IT'S THE JEWISH MEDIA WHO'S FEEDING YOU THAT HOGWASH. THEN THEY'VE GOT THIS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BULLSHIT. I'VE GOT 6 FRIENDS WHO COULDN'T GET INTO YALE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED ROOM FOR UNDERQUALIFIED BLACKS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? WHERE'S THE JUSTICE IN THAT? IT'S REVERSE DISCRIMINATION. LOOK AT LOS ANGELES. RODNEY KING! THEY TREAT WHITE CRIMINALS WITH KID GLOVES. A BLACK KID WILL SIT IN JAIL LONGER FOR STEALING A CONTAINER OF MILK THAN ONE OF THOSE WHITE NECKTIES WILL FOR TAX EVASION! WHERE'S THE JUSTICE? A PACK OF ANIMALS KILLED AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER, YANKEL--WHAT'S HIS NAME? YANKEL ROSENBAUM. RIGHT. THEY KILLED YANKEL ROSENBAUM IN COLD BLOOD, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE ARREST. IN BENSONHURST AND HOWARD BEACH, THEY ARREST A DOZEN WHITE BOYS FOR THE SAME CRIME. IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD. I'M TELLING YOU, THE ITALIANS HAVE GOT IT RIGHT. THE ONLY WAY TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE IS WITH CLUBS AND GUNS BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND. LET THE JEWS TAKE THEIR MONEY AND GO LIVE IN ISRAEL. LET THEM ALL GO BACK TO AFRICA. THEY'RE COMIN' TO GET ME! THEY'RE COMIN' TO GET ME! OH, MY GOODNESS. THEY'RE COMIN' TO GET ME! WHAT'S WRONG, MRS. WASHINGTON? THE MARTIANS ARE COMING. I KNOW IT. I FEEL IT! I FEEL THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ZAPPING ME! WHAT CAN I DO? TRY ZAPPING THEM BACK. YO, BERKOWITZ! WHEN YOU GONNA FIX MY LEAKING TOILET?! I'M TAKING CARE OF IT. YOU SAID THAT LAST WEEK! HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA BE PISSING AT MY NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?! YOU WANT SERVICE? YEAH, FUCK, I WANT SERVICE! TRY PAYING YOUR RENT ON TIME. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT AN EXTRA 3 WEEKS LIKE I DID LAST MONTH. CHEAP ASS MOTHERFUCKER! [RAP MUSIC PLAYS] HOW ABOUT HELPING OUT? LEAVE ME ALONE, MICHAEL. WHAT, JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT BASKETBALL TRYOUTS TOMORROW YOU CAN'T DO NOTHIN'? EXACTLY. Mother: LEAVE KEVIN ALONE! WHY? I'M TIRED OF HIM GETTIN' A FREE RIDE. YOU THINK THAT BASKETBALL'S THE ANSWER TO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS? WHAT IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT? WHAT YOU GONNA DO THEN, PUMP GAS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? I DON'T SEE YOUR PUNK ASS PULLING DOWN NO 6 FIGURES. I GO TO SCHOOL. I GOT A CHANCE, WHICH IS MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER HAVE. Mother: YOU BOYS GOTTA STOP THIS. I'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT YOU TWO FIGHTING. AT LEAST I BRING IN SOME EXTRA CASH DELIVERING. ALL YOU DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME IS AN ELDUARDO DA VINCI BULLSHIT, SO WHAT YOU SAYING? FUCK YOU! FUCK ME? OH, YOU WANT SOME OF THIS? STOP IT! DON'T YOU DARE TALK LIKE THAT IN MY HOME! NOW, LOOK... KEVIN HAS A POINT. OH, MA, COME ON. LISTEN, YOUR--YOUR DRAWINGS ARE GOOD AND FINE, BUT THEY DON'T PUT NO BREAD ON THE TABLE. IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE LIVING HERE, YOU GOTTA EARN YOUR KEEP. GET A JOB IN YOUR SPARE TIME. AND THEN WHEN ALL THE BILLS ARE PAID, THEN GO BACK TO YOUR DRAWING. BUT, MA, I'M JUST TRYING-- NO, NO, NO BUTS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YEAH. OK. JULIO, WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU, SCREWING YOUR 14-YEAR-OLDS? HEY, MAN, I MUST'VE DOZED OFF. THAT WHAT I PAY YOU FOR? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING CARE OF THIS DUMP. I DO, MAN. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN THIS PLACE UP. I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE, MAN. YOU GOT THE SHIT? YEAH, I DO, I DO, MAN. WAIT. IT'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S THE BEST. BEST. YEAH, YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE BOYS AT YALE WILL LIKE THIS. YEAH, YEAH. YOU GOT THE CASH, MAN? HEY, HAVE I EVER STIFFED YOU BEFORE? HERE. HERE'S YOUR CASH. HEY! THERE'S 2 GRAND MISSING HERE! I KNOW. IT'S JUST SO YOU WON'T RUN OUT ON ME. HEY, MAN, THE BOYS WON'T LIKE THIS. TELL THE BOYS THE MONEY WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK. I JUST HOPE-- ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BUILDING? YEAH, MRS. JEFFERSON'S RADIATOR NEEDS FIXING, AND MRS. JOHNSON'S TOILET IS LEAKING. YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS. MRS. JEFFERSON'S THE ONE WITH THE TOILET PROBLEM. HAVE YOU CALLED THE PLUMBER YET? NO, NOT YET. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR? NO WONDER THIS PLACE IS FALLING APART. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT? HE'S WITH ME, MAN. WHAT YOU WANT HERE, MAN? JULIO, YOU GOT A COUPLE OF BUCKS I COULD BORROW FOR A FEW DAYS? AW, COME ON, MAN! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS COME TO ME FOR BREAD? WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE TO YOU, SOME KIND OF SAVINGS AND LOAN? HEY, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. YO, ALL THAT CAN'T BE YOURS. HEY, SWEET DREAM, BOY. THAT BREAD AIN'T KOSHER. MOTHERFUCKER STIFFED ME FOR 2 GRAND! NOW I GOT TO ANSWER TO THE HOMEBOYS. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT. SMART BOY, MAN. YOU STAY OUTTA THIS SHIT. MAYBE I COULD DO SOME HANDY WORK ON THE WEEKENDS. YOU CRAZY? FRED WILL KILL YOU IF YOU TAKE HIS WORK. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I NEED THE MONEY. LOOK, I KNOW 2 WAYS YOU CAN MAKE BREAD AROUND HERE. YOU EITHER GET A JOB, OR YOU CROSS THE LINE AND DO WHAT US SUCKERS DO, MAN. YOU GO DEAL DRUGS OR STEAL. HEY, IT'S NOT GLAMOROUS, BUT IT'S A LIVING. I AIN'T THAT DESPERATE. NOT YET, YOU AIN'T. MURRAY, WOULD YOU LISTEN? NO. I SEND YOU TO DO WIENERS, YOU DO WIENERS, NOT SOCIOLOGY. WIENERS, HOT DOGS, MUSTARD, RELISH, PICKLES, SAUERKRAUT, BUNS. IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE, 300 FAT SLOBS STUFFING THEIR FACES WITH THEIR BEER BELLIES HANGING OUT? MURRAY, I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING IMPORTANT FOR A CHANGE, SOMETHING SERIOUS. LOOK, IF I WANTED SERIOUS, I'D HAVE HIRED WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY. WHAT I WANT FROM YOU IS FLUFF. FLUFF. FLUFF. FLUFF! STUFF THAT SELLS RATINGS. WE CALL IT HUMAN INTEREST. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE RACIAL MUMBO JUMBO FROM YOU. HEY, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD DO MORE THAN JUST GIVE THE BASKETBALL SCORES. I'LL TALK TO HIM FOR YOU. AND YOU, GOLDILOCKS, IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU TOOK A HAIRCUT. YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. MISSOURI. I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE A GODDAMN KINDERGARTEN TEACHER. CAN I GET SOME PROFESSIONALISM AROUND HERE? DAMN HYMIE NAZI. LISTEN, CAN YOU HELP ME FIGURE OUT THESE SCHEDULES? LET ME SEE. EVERYBODY AROUND HERE IS EITHER JEWISH, BLACK, SPANISH, OR CHINESE. AREN'T THERE ANY REGULAR PEOPLE IN NEW YORK? LISTEN, I'M SORRY. WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT? I'M VERY BUSY. OK, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT? FORGET IT. HERE. SHIT. GOOD MORNING, MR. HECKLAND. NO CIGARETTES. [BELL RINGING] GOOD MORNING, INEZ, JOANNE. LATE AGAIN. GOOD MORNING, MICHAEL. HEY, MR. LAIDLAW. GEORGE, CARLOS, GO TO CLASS. JOSE, MELISSA, LET'S MOVE ON. SO HOW IS YOUR MOTHER? SHE'S DOING ALL RIGHT. WORKING HARD AS USUAL, I'LL IMAGINE. SHE KNOW ANY OTHER WAY? YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN YOUR FATHER FIRST MET YOUR MOTHER. IT'S A SHAME THAT HE DIED THE WAY HE DID. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND, SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME. IT'S ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER. MR. SAXTON? ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HIM? I SAW HIM DEALING DRUGS WITH ACTION AND GREASER AFTER SCHOOL YESTERDAY. YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE HARD ACCUSATIONS, MICHAEL. VERY HARD. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? YEAH. I'LL LOOK INTO THIS. IN THE MEANTIME, STAY AWAY FROM GREASER AND ACTION. I'LL HANDLE THIS. JUDY, I SAW THE TAPE OF THE CONEY ISLAND VENDOR. SO DID MURRAY. OBVIOUSLY YOU, TOO, HAVE AN OPINION. IT'S VERY ONE-SIDED. GREAT. ANOTHER LECTURE. COME ON. IT'S SO EASY TO BLAME BLACK PEOPLE. LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN IT AS AN INDICTMENT OF ALL BLACK PEOPLE. BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO? I MEAN, LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO BE AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, DO EXACTLY THAT, INVESTIGATE. GET BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. WHAT GOOD IS THAT GOING TO DO? NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO A WOMAN ANYWAY. COME ON, JUDY. LOOK, I'M AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. BECOMING AN ANCHORMAN ON A NEW YORK NEWSCAST WAS BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS. YOU KNOW, I NEVER EXPECTED THIS TO HAPPEN, BUT IT DID HAPPEN. IT IS POSSIBLE. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE JEWISH, THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL. YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE JEWISH. ABRAHAM LINCOLN... JOHN F. KENNEDY, MARTIN LUTHER KING... ANWAR SADAT... MALCOLM X... WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN COMMON? ANYONE? MICHAEL? UM, AHEM, THEY-- THEY WERE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVISTS WHO WANTED SOCIAL CHANGE, BUT, UM... BEFORE THEY... COULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING, THEY WERE ASSASSINATED. Saxton: THAT'S TRUE. BUT WHAT ELSE DO THESE FAMOUS PEOPLE HAVE IN COMMON? WHAT ELSE DO THEY SHARE? MICHAEL? NO ANSWER. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. THEY ALL TRIED TO CHANGE THE WORLD. THEY WERE OBSESSIVE VISIONARIES WHO TRIED TO RESHAPE THE EARTH INTO WHAT THEIR VISION OF THE WORLD SHOULD BE. AH, BUT WHAT WAS THEIR FATE? WHAT REWARD DID THEY RECEIVE FOR ALL THEIR EFFORTS? IN THE END, ALL THEY GOT WAS GRIEF, PAIN, MISERY, AND A PREMATURE DEATH. NOW, SOME SAY THEY TRIED TOO HARD. SOME SAY THEY WERE TOO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN AFFAIRS THAT DID NOT CONCERN THEM. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS SHIT NO MORE. COME ON, MAN. I SAW SAXTON ALL OVER YOU THIS AFTERNOON. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? LOOK, IT'S NOTHING. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. COME ON. WE'RE NOT STUPID. THERE'S SOMETHING GOIN' ON BETWEEN YOU TWO. LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE A LOT SAFER IF Y'ALL DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. THAT'S YOUR MAN. LOOK, I SAW SAXTON DEALING WITH ACTION AND GREASER AFTER SCHOOL YESTERDAY. WHAT? NO SHIT! DID YOU TELL THE PRINCIPAL? YEAH, HE SAID HE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT. YOU MEAN SAXTON'S A DRUG DEALER? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT-- DON'T GO TELLING NOBODY YOU HEARD THAT! I AIN'T SAYIN' SHIT, MAN. GOOD. SO WHERE WE GOIN' FOR LUNCH? I GOTTA STUDY FOR A GEOMETRY TEST. COME ON. WHY? I MEAN. COME ON, BABY. YOU ALREADY GOT THE CURVES AND THE CIRCLES AND THE RECTANGLES. NO, YOU GOT THAT BOX, HERE, RIGHT? COME ON, STOP. I GOTTA GO. GO THEN. SEE YA LATER. YO, LOVER BOY, LET'S PULL A JOB NOW. WE GOT THE TIME. MAN, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? YOU ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ROBBING AND STEALING? DON'T YOU HAVE A CONSCIENCE? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. NOBODY CARED WHEN MY BROTHER GOT KILLED BY SOME WHITE PIECE OF SHIT. WHY SHOULD I CARE? NOBODY CARES. NOBODY MATTERS. IT MATTERS TO THE COMMUNITY. IT MATTERS TO THE BLACK IMAGE. FUCK THE BLACK IMAGE! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BLACK IMAGE. WHEN WHITE BOYS STEAL, THEY MAKE HEROES OUT OF THEM-- JESSE JAMES, BUTCH CASSIDY, ALL THEM MACHO MOVIES. WHEN BLACK BOYS STEAL, WE'RE CONSIDERED ANIMALS, SCUMS OF THE EARTH. YO, WHY DON'T YOU CONSIDER ME AS A MOTHERFUCKIN' ROBIN HOOD, THE ROBIN HOOD OF EAST FLATBUSH? DON'T GIVE ME YOUR SELF-RIGHTEOUS BULLSHIT. SO, YOU'RE GONNA START RUNNING AROUND TOWN WEARING A MASK AND A CAPE CALLING YOURSELF BATMAN? LOOK, MAN, I DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO TO SURVIVE, AND YOU BETTER DO THE SAME THING IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE PLAYING WITH YOUR FINGERPAINTING. I KNOW WHERE YOU GO AFTER SCHOOL. EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYTHING. YOU CAN'T HIDE THINGS AROUND HERE. IF YOU WANT TO HELP YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOUR FAMILY, YOU BETTER START LIVING REALITY. YOU KNOW YOU NEED THE MONEY. YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING NICE FOR SIMONE? WHERE YOU GONNA GET THE BREAD? BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, MAN, SHE'S GONNA RUN OFF WITH SOME RICH MOTHERFUCKIN' DRUG DEALER FUCK YOU! AND LEAVE YOUR ASS! SO ARE YOU WITH ME OR WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG, JUDY? I'M SUFFOCATING AT THE STATION. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT I COULD BE DOING. YOU ALWAYS DO THAT. YOU'RE NEVER SATISFIED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE. YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE, AND THEN YOU WIND UP LOSING EVERYTHING YOU ALREADY HAVE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH WANTING MORE? SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE ONE TO STUNT AMBITION? IT'S JUST WHEN WILL IT BE ENOUGH? HOW MANY GIRLS GET TO BE ON TELEVISION EVERY DAY? ONLY THE PRETTY ONES. THAT'S THE POINT. IF I CONTINUE DOING WHAT I'M DOING, I'M GOING TO BE REPLACED AS SOON AS SOMEONE YOUNGER AND PRETTIER WALKS THROUGH THE PRODUCER'S DOOR. THE ONLY WAY I CAN LAST IN THIS BUSINESS IS IF I MAKE MY MARK AS A JOURNALIST AND NOT AS A VIDEO DOLL. IS THERE SOMEBODY YOU CAN TALK TO? WELL, YES, THERE ARE A LOT OF BRIGHT AND INTERESTING PEOPLE WORKING THERE. JUST REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE. MA, I KNOW WHO I AM, AND I WORK WITH VERY GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT JEWISH. SO WHAT? JEWS AREN'T THE ONLY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW? WHO'S TALKING ABOUT GOOD? I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE "JUDY BERKOWITZ TO WED JASON VAN HORN" IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SOCIAL COLUMN. 50% OF ALL THE JEWS IN THIS COUNTRY MARRY GENTILES. WE'RE DOING TO OURSELVES WHAT THE GOYIM HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO TO US FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. MA, PLEASE. WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF IDENTITY? I KNOW WHO I AM! DO YOU? AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHO YOU ARE? WELL, ARE YOU JUDY BERKOWITZ OR JUDY BURKE? WHICH ONE IS IT? OH, PLEASE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH BERKOWITZ? YOU DISGRACE YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY WHEN YOU CHANGE HIS NAME. IT'S NOT A JEWISH WORLD OUT THERE! I NEEDED EVERY BREAK I COULD GET, AND IT JUST SEEMED SAFER. SAFER? IF WE WANTED SAFETY, WE'D ALL CONVERT TO CHRISTIANITY! YOU'RE ASHAMED OF YOUR RELIGION. NO, I'M NOT! YES, YOU ARE. ADMIT IT. I'M SURE THAT NOBODY AT THAT STATION KNOWS THAT YOU'RE JEWISH! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, MA. TIMES HAVE CHANGED. WE'VE JOINED THE REST OF SOCIETY. IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS. IN THE OLD DAYS, WE SACRIFICED FOR OUR RELIGION. AND WHERE DID THAT GET YOU? BUBBE AND ZAIDIE DIDN'T LET YOU DO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU WANTED TO DO. YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS, A DANCER. BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU DO THOSE THINGS, AND LOOK AT YOU NOW. YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF EVERYTHING I'M ACCOMPLISHING RIGHT NOW. JEALOUS? HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT, JUDY? I LOVE YOU. I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF YOU. I JUST DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL, ESPECIALLY HERE IN NEW YORK. YOU'RE INTELLIGENT, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, YOU'RE WITTY. YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL AT EVERYTHING YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO. I SEE YOU INVOLVED IN EVERY OTHER SOCIAL ISSUE. WHY NOT BE PROUD OF YOUR RELIGION? YOU THINK YOU CAN SHED YOUR JUDAISM SO EASILY BY CHANGING YOUR NAME AND DRESSING LIKE A SHIKSA? WELL, YOU'RE WRONG. YOU CAN RUN ALL YOU WANT, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A JEW, AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE A JEW. COME ON, MAN. LET'S GO. SHE LOOKS LIKE A RICH BITCH. MAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TALKED ME INTO THIS. TAKE THAT SHIT OFF, MAN! JUST REMEMBER ROBIN HOOD. ROB-- MAN, I FEEL LIKE THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM, THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO DO NOTHING. JUST BUMP INTO HER. I'LL GRAB THE BAG. NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! COME ON! COME ON, MAN! COME ON! COME BACK! COME BACK! HEY. STEAL FROM THE RICH... GIVE TO THE POOR. [RAP MUSIC PLAYS] [VOICES SHOUTING] NOW, THAT WASN'T SO BAD NOW, WAS IT? [BELL RINGS] Judy: MURRAY. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? PUT IT ON THE NEWS. NO WAY. WHY NOT? DID THEY FONDLE YOU? DID THEY SEXUALLY MOLEST YOU? NO. THEN IT AIN'T NEWS. I THINK I CAN GET MY BAG BACK. HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT? ONE OF THE KIDS HAD THIS STRANGE LOOK IN HIS EYE, LIKE HE WAS DESPERATE. I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU. I REALLY DO, BUT I CANNOT LET THE NEWS BECOME A VEHICLE FOR PERSONAL AGENDAS. DAMN NIGGERS LOOSE IN THIS JUNGLE. YO, MAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

NOW A LOT OF DRUGS ARE BEING SOLD IN THIS HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH. NOW WHERE DO THESE KIDS GET THESE DRUGS? CAN YOU TELL ME? FROM THEIR HOUSE. FROM THEIR HOUSE? NEIGHBORHOOD. FATHER. DO THEIR FATHER-- THEIR FATHER? NOW HOW OLD ARE MOST OF THESE KIDS THAT KIND OF-- THEY START YOUNG. 11 AND UP. 11 OR UP? 11. HAVE YOU EVER HAD, LIKE, A BROTHER OR, YOU KNOW, OR A SISTER STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF THING? I-- NO. YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHO GETS INVOLVED IN IT. THEY--THEY KEEP IT A SECRET. NOW DO THEY BRING THEM INTO THE SCHOOL. DO THEY SELL THEM IN THE SCHOOL? YEAH. IN THE HALLWAYS? YEAH. WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU LET THIS TV REPORTER SNOOP AROUND HERE. WHAT IS THIS, A FUCKING CIRCUS? LOOK, ALEX, I FIGURE IT'LL BE GOOD FOR THE SCHOOL, GOOD FOR THE STUDENTS. MAYBE RAISE THEIR HEIGHTS A LITTLE BIT. RAISE THEIR HEIGHTS. I CAN'T AFFORD TO RAISE THEIR HEIGHTS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO RAISE THEIR HEIGHTS. LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE SCHOOL, YOU GOT TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, MAINTAIN STATUS QUO, AND JUST DO BUSINESS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NO MORE FUCKING PUBLICITY STUNTS. OK, WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL? I DON'T WANT HIM HURT. YOU DON'T WANT HIM HURT? THEN YOU MAKE SURE HE KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT, BECAUSE I DO, IT'S GOING TO BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION. I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE TAKING HEAT ON THIS. IF THAT BOY FINGERS ME, I'M TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME. YOU AND THIS WHOLE FUCKING SCHOOL. [SIGHS] AND YOU GUYS SEE THIS--THIS GOING ON? EVERY DAY. LIKE, IN BIOLOGY CLASS YOU SEE SOMEBODY SELLING DRUGS? YOU SEE THEM PASSING IT, 'CAUSE THEY KNOW WHO TO GO TO AND EVERYTHING. YOU GUYS--YOU GUYS EVER GO TO THE, UH, THE PRINCIPAL AND ASK HIM, TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON? NO, 'CAUSE WE GET TOO SCARED. OR THE TEACHERS OR SOMETHING? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? THAT BITCH JUDY BURK FROM THE TV, MAN. WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING OUT HERE? TURN THAT SHIT OFF. LEAVE ME ALONE, OK? I DIDN'T COME HERE TO-- NO, YOU BETTER GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND START THAT SHIT. NOT AROUND HERE THOUGH. I WILL LEAVE, ALL RIGHT? TURN THAT SHIT OFF. YOU BETTER NOT BE ASKING NOTHING OVER HERE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LEAVE HER ALONE, LEAVE HER ALONE. THIS IS NOT SOME FUCKING JUNGLE. GET BACK IN SCHOOL. GO ON. GO ON. WE GOT TO GO BACK. DO WHAT I TELL YOU. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH. THANKS A LOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THESE STUDENTS ARE ANIMALS. THEY SHOULD BE LOCKED UP IN A CAGE, MAYBE EVEN CASTRATED. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE BY YOURSELF? I CAME TO THIS HIGH-- WE USED TO GO TO THIS HIGH SCHOOL A LONG TIME AGO. I'M A REPORTER, AND I'M DOING A STORY ON THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED HERE OVER THE YEARS, SO I THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN AND INTERVIEW A FEW NICE STUDENTS MM-HMM. ON WHAT HAPPENED. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. [SIGHS] YEAH. WELL, YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED. MM-HMM. THESE STUDENTS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF PHRASING COMPLETE SENTENCES. I THINK YOU'D BE BETTER OFF TALKING TO A TEACHER. MY NAME'S ALEX SAXTON. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. SAXTON. THANK YOU. I'M JUDY BURKE, BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY. I BELIEVE I DO. RUMOR HAS IT THAT TEACHERS ARE ACTUALLY SELLING DRUGS HERE TO STUDENTS. IS THIS TRUE? I DOUBT IT'S TRUE, BUT, UH, IF IT WERE, I ALMOST CAN'T BLAME THEM. WHAT WITH THE LOUSY 25 GRAND SOME OF US MAKE A YEAR TO START. LOOK, THESE KIDS ARE KILLING THEMSELVES IN THE STREETS. LOOK AROUND YOU, MISS BURK. THIS IS A WAR ZONE. IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER DOWN HERE WHO SUPPLIES THE DRUGS. THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT ANY WAY THEY CAN. BUT, GOD, HA, THESE ARE YOUR STUDENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW, DO YOU HATE THESE PEOPLE? LOOK, I DON'T HATE THEM. IT'S JUST THAT NEW YORK IS TURNING INTO SOME GOD-AWFUL THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, AND EVERYWHERE I GO, PEOPLE WITH STRANGE FACES, WEIRD CLOTHING, AND CRAZY CUSTOMS ARE SPEAKING TO ME IN LANGUAGES THAT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. SEEING YOU GETTING ATTACKED LIKE THAT? IT JUST GETS TO ME. MICHAEL-- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE? WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED TO MY FACE? I DON'T KNOW. I GOT JUMPED BY ACTION AND GREASER AFTER SCHOOL YESTERDAY. YES. I GOT JUMPED. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SAXTON. YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT ACTION AND GREASER, TOO. WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S GOING ON? THERE'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION. HA. OH, INVESTIGATION? THAT AIN'T GOING TO DO NOBODY HERE AT THE SCHOOL ANY GOOD. WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? JUDY, I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD GO TO THE POLICE. NO, I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE KID, MICHAEL STALLWORTH, AND HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY FOR HIMSELF. I MEAN, IT'S INCREDIBLE. I WENT TO THAT SCHOOL, AND I HARDLY RECOGNIZED THE PLACE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S SIMPLE. THE SCHOOL BOARD SPENDS, WHAT, $7,000 A YEAR ON EACH STUDENT IN NEW YORK CITY? THE AVERAGE KID IN LONG ISLAND GETS 10 TIMES AS MUCH. I MEAN, MONEY ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. 79th AND AMSTERDAM, PLEASE. BUT YOU KNOW, FAMILY ISN'T THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC EDUCATION IS. MEANS IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN FISCAL EQUALITY FOR ALL ITS KIDS, BLACK OR WHITE. YOU MEAN RICH OR POOR. NO, I MEAN BLACK OR WHITE, JUDY. RACISM IS A PART OF ALL THIS. YOU PEOPLE ALWAYS BLAME EVERYTHING ON RACISM. OH, WELL, YOU JEWS DO THE SAME WHEN YOU CRY ANTI-SEMITISM. BUT WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WITH NOTHING AND BUILT OURSELVES UP FROM THE GHETTO. WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE THE SAME? ON, COME ON. YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE RELIGION, BUT NOT COLOR, JUDY. I MEAN, HEY, DON'T FORGET, WE CAME HERE AS SLAVES. GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO. WE'VE HAD OUR SHARE OF MISERY, TOO. HOLOCAUST WAS NO PICNIC, YOU KNOW. OH, LOOK, THIS IS LIKE ARGUING DISEASES. YOU HAVE CANCER, I HAVE AIDS. WHICH IS WORSE? WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO BOTH OUR PROBLEMS. THEN WHY BLAME US FOR ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS? WHY THE HATRED? I GUESS JEWS ARE AN EASY TARGET, YOU KNOW. IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING MIDDLE AMERICANS WILL AGREE WITH US ON. [LAUGHS] WHAT? IT'S INTERESTING THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS KIND OF EMOTION BEFORE. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS KIND OF PASSION. JUDY... YOU THINK OF ME AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BLACK PEOPLE, MAYBE BECAUSE I DRESS WELL, SPEAK ELOQUENTLY, MAYBE BECAUSE I'M A LIGHTER VERSION, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? INSIDE I HAVE THIS-- THIS RAGE. THE SAME RAGE THAT BURNS IN EVERY BLACK MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA. IT'S A RAGE YOU JEWS HAVE LOST. WE'RE TRYING TO FIT IN. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING AN ENTIRE AFRICAN NATION. OH, COME ON. DON'T YOU KNOW YOU CAN NEVER FIT IN? ALL RIGHT, MAYBE YOU CAN FOOL SOME PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT INSIDE YOU'RE AS JEWISH AS THE CHASIDIM IN WILLIAMSBURG. JUDY, I AM PROUD TO BE BLACK. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PROUD TO BE JEWISH. OF COURSE I'M PROUD TO BE JEWISH. JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WEAR IT ON MY SLEEVE DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T SUPPORT JEWISH CAUSES AND ORGANIZATIONS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS OR B'NAI BRITH, SOME FACELESS ORGANIZATIONS ON CAPITOL HILL. YOU NEED CHARISMATIC LEADERS TO COME TO THE FOREFRONT, ESPECIALLY FROM AMONG THE MEDIA. HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WON'T DEFEND YOUR OWN PEOPLE, WHO WILL? WHO WILL? MOTHERFUCKER, WAKE UP! EVERYBODY, WAKE UP! WAKE THE FUCK UP! SCHWANNA, SHUT YOUR LITTLE ASS UP. YOU'RE WAKING UP THE DEAD.

SCHWANNA. WHY? YES. STOP, MICHAEL! WHERE YOU GOING? WHERE YOU GOING? STOP, MICHAEL! GET OFF ME! MICHAEL, BE REASONABLE. YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED ACTION AND GREASER WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

SAXTON OUT OF THERE, OR I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE. CALL THE POLICE. YOU LIKE WHAT I GOTTA SAY. PLEASE, I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS, MICHAEL. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE? WHAT ABOUT SCHWANNA? YEAH, WHAT ABOUT SCHWANNA? YOU'RE GUILTY FOR HER DEATH! IT WASN'T MY FAULT! THAT'S BULLSHIT! [MUSIC PLAYS] [KIDS TAUNTING] YOU PIECE OF SHIT, IT'S YOUR FAULT SCHWANNA DIED! IT'S YOUR FAULT, MAN! YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE! FUCK YOU, MAN! FUCK YOU! YOU'RE JUST A FUCKING RACIST! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT US. MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE KIDS GO HOME. I DON'T WANT NO KIDS AROUND THE SCHOOL. I DON'T WANT NO POLICEMEN. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS OURSELVES. AND I DON'T WANT NO PRESS. YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. I'M ALL RIGHT. I NEEDED TO GET AWAY FOR A FEW HOURS. JUDY, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. [KIDS SHOUTING] [MUSIC PLAYS] WHAT ARE THEY DOING UP THERE? I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE... LETTING OFF A LITTLE STEAM, MAYBE? I'M YOUR FUCKIN' TEACHER! Guard: SHALL I CALL THE POLICE? Leilo: NO POLICE. I DON'T WANT ANYONE GETTING ARRESTED TODAY. EVERYONE, TAKE A LOOK. [MUSIC STOPS] Anchorman: GOOD EVENING.

YOU CAN KICK AND SCREAM ALL YOU WANT, BUT NO ONE'S GONNA LISTEN TO YOU, EVEN IF IT IS THE TRUTH. YOU GOT NO CREDIBILITY. AND YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR BLACK SKIN.

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK THAT YOUR LIFE IS SO FUCKED UP THAT YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF UNLESS YOU'RE SHITTIN' ON SOMEBODY ELSE. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. SEE, IT'S THAT SIMPLE... I THINK THAT THE ONLY PERSON YOU REALLY HATE... IS YOUR OWN DAMN SELF. [POUNDING] Officer: OPEN UP IN THERE. THIS IS THE POLICE. OPEN UP, OR WE'RE COMING IN. FIRST HEAR WHAT WE GOT TO SAY.

Y-YEAH. WHO'S THIS? YO, TELL 'EM TO STOP. THIS IS JUDY FROM CHANNEL 6 NEWS. YOU'RE GONNA BE ON THE AIR LIVE IN 5 SECONDS. THIS IS JUDY BURKE REPORTING LIVE FROM EAST FLATBUSH HIGH SCHOOL. ON THE LINE IS MICHAEL STALLWORTH, ONE OF THE BOYS ALLEGEDLY HOLDING ALEX SAXTON HOSTAGE IN A CLASSROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR. WHAT WAS NOT REPORTED EARLIER IS THAT MICHAEL'S SISTER SCHWANNA STALLWORTH WAS KILLED IN A SHOOT-OUT EARLIER BETWEEN 2 DRUG DEALERS. MICHAEL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY KILLED MY SISTER! Judy: WHO KILLED YOUR SISTER? ALL OF 'EM! TH-TH-TH-THE TEACHERS, THE PRINCIPALS-- THEY'RE ALL INVOLVED WITH THE DRUG DEALERS, AND NOBODY GIVES A DAMN TO STOP 'EM. MICHAEL, WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO THE AUTHORITIES? THE POLICE DON'T CARE, THE POLITICIANS DON'T GIVE A DAMN, AND THE SCHOOL BOARD'S WORTHLESS. LOOK, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE SAME EDUCATION AS EVERYBODY ELSE. STOP THE DRUGS, STOP THE CRIME, AND STOP SELLIN' US OUT. SO THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE? YOU'RE NOT HOLDING MR. SAXTON HOSTAGE BECAUSE HE'S WHITE? I TOLD YOU. WE'RE HOLDING THE BASTARD BECAUSE HE'S SON OF A BITCH DRUG DEALER. BLACK AND WHITE NEVER HAD NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT. THAT'S JUST THE TV AND NEWSPAPERS TURNING THE WHOLE STORY AROUND. LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE BLACK, WHITE, PURPLE, WHATEVER. YOU TAKE AWAY MY OPPORTUNITY, AND YOU'RE MY ENEMY. LOOK, I'M PROUD TO BE BLACK. OUR LIVES COUNT JUST AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE'S. ALL WE WANT IS JUSTICE. ALL WE WANT IS A CHANCE. DO YOU THINK YOUR ACTIONS HERE TONIGHT WILL ERASE YEARS OF RACISM? DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE ONLY CAUSING MORE HATE? I--I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD DO. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PAST. I ONLY CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE. OUR FUTURE. I TRIED EVERYTHING. I TURNED EVERYWHERE, I'VE BEEN BETRAYED BY EVERYONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO? SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? Officer: MICHAEL, PLEASE COME OUT. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. MICHAEL, PLEASE COME OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. IT APPEARS THAT THIS FRIGHTFUL NIGHT IS FINALLY OVER. MR. LAIDLAW, THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL, CONFESSED TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE HIS SHAMEFUL DISPLAY OF APATHY. HIS TESTIMONY WILL LIKELY HELP CONVICT THE TEACHER ALEX SAXTON. PERHAPS THIS ORDEAL WILL HELP WAKE UP CITY OFFICIALS AND FELLOW CITIZENS TO THE PLIGHT OF OUR INNER CITIES AND PREVENT OCCURRENCES LIKE THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, AS HISTORY HAS PROVEN, WE HAVE DREADFULLY SHORT MEMORIES. I'M JUDY BERKOWITZ, REPORTING FOR CHANNEL 6 NEWS. [SIREN WAILS] SO WHAT NOW? WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? I DON'T KNOW, MICHAEL. I WISH I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS. I GUESS WE GOTTA MAKE OUR OWN.
