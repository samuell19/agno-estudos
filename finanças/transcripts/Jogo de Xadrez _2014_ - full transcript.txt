"42 MILLIONS ARE GONE FROM THE VAULTS OF SOCIAL WELFARE" MAY 25, 2010. "SENATOR FRANCO IS INNOCENT FROM CRIMES AGAINST SOCIAL WELFARE. "GUILHERMINA DOS SANTOS, FRANCO'S ASSISTANT, IS CONDEMNED FOR 16 YEARS." Eugênio, tell Geraldo, I want to see my sister. Yes, ma'am. Is it all here? Yeah. Dammit, you're fucking with me! I'm not getting in. Shut up, and get in, dammit. Shit, I'm not a sardine. I'm not making two trips. Son of the bitch! Shit! That's my foot, you dick! Dammit! My foot, dammit! Asshole! Excuse me, sir. Jullienne brought the goods. Anything else? She asked to see Miss Guilhermina. Shampoo, comb, lices killer. Nail-file, sandals. Thirty bucks. Here it is. Good morning your excellency. How are you? Okay. Okay. I'll take care of it. Forty. We're not sardines, you dick! I'll open it. Be careful. Move it. Move. Dammit, don't push me. Can't you see I'm walking. Damn it. You shit. I want white. C'mon, Mina. Just a bag. You owe me. I'm paying you. Give me a break, sell it to me. You think you own this place? You damn right. Mina, everyone knows that without your kiss ass Godzilla, you're not that tough. Shut it up! Wait, Martona! Take her to the infirmary. Go! Eugênio. Eugênio, bring Guilhermina here. Copy that. Mina, the man wants to see you, now. Take over, Martona. Got it. Okay now, listen you bitches. Damn you. Enter, Guilhermina. You like the new meat? Mind your own business. Sit. Your parole was denied. You didn't even send my papers to the judge. Stop the show. Give me my cut. There are alot of people who want to keep you here. Your parole is out of my control. The day they release me, your little friend Franco will have to pay what he owes me. The Senator has nothing to do with it. Don't lie to me, Geraldo, I know you've been talking. Mina, Mina... justice caught up with you just to prove that... in Brazil white collar crime leads to jail. You had a big scam going with the welfare, didn't you? So the Senator still owes you your big cut. You still have thirteen years in here. It's along time to wait for what is yours. I could help you. I can wait. Besides you said, you have no power over my parole. How much did he offer you? You couldn't cover his offer. Or could you? It seems that you're without options. Your money is with him, isn't it? But I have a way for you to get it. How? If you cooperate. Give me the evidence that incriminates the Senator. Are you done, Geraldo? For now. One more thing. Your sister is here. Eugênio, send the next one in. My name is Geraldo. I'm the warden of the presidio. Enchanted. Elizabeth Cristina Pereira, thirty seven years old, sentenced to six years in a federal penitentiary for car theft. That's my business. It says here that you've been in twice and escaped in both ocasions. Is that all? You don't stand a chance to do that here! Time will tell. Stand. I like your way of welcoming. You'll like it more. Ok, I lost it. I'm cool. Let me go. Take that bitch to the hole! Impotent! Honey, I'm here. CHESS GAME - Jogo de Xadrez - How are you, Ju? What's with the smile?! Tell. I got it. Franco's son?! Alberto. Yes. At first I didn't like the idea. He is the son of the man who put you away. But I made a sacrifice to help you. I don't know how to thank you. The hard part was going to bed with him. Ju, if it makes you feel bad, stop. No! No way! I'll help you out, whatever it takes. Your suffering in here is bigger than mine out there. What?! What is it? Franco's cell phone number. I took it from Alberto's mobile. Tonight, I'll dine with my "father in law". He wants to meet me. I confess that I don't know how my reaction will be. Control yourself, this guy is dangerous, Ju. Hold your temper! It'll be hard, but I'll try. I got tell you, Franco's wife is a pain in the ass. She died last year. Lucky me. From now on things will get tougher, Ju. You taught me how to be strong. Don't worry, it'll be all right. We'll have lots of fun when you get out of here. That's all I want in my life. What is it, Jullienne?! What are you doing, Ju? Ju, stop it! Damn, are you sure Alberto is taking care of business? No! Good heavens, this is nasty. You'll need it. Look I'm in drought, but it's not that bad. Eugênio helped me. No! He helped me pass it through the frisk, damn! Okay. Did you come when it vibrated? Naughty girl. It works. I gotta go. Be careful, ok? Relax, I can take care of myself. I see. Bye. Sit. I know that you owe money to Mina. I'll help you. I'll help you to pay this debt. You know, Preta, it is hard to run a prison. People plotting to get your job, it's a fucking political nightmare. The guards are unhappy with their shitty salaries, and way down in the bottom, rising up from shit are people like you, Mina. Sometimes, I need to step in the shit to change things. Valtinho likes you. He likes you. I don't know why, but he does. I have an order and if you don't obey... Valtinho will make your life worst than it is now. And you know how bad can get, don't you? Yes. So, are you with me? What I have to do? Mina. But she's hard to get close to. Here, this will motivate you. It's more than you owe to her. And to prove that I'm a nice guy... if you do what I'm asking, I will make sure you take over her business. But who will protect me? Godzilla is always around her. Valtinho will take care of Martona. You can go. Enough. And shut up. Here. What's up with the smile? What's that? Get out, I don't like women. Check it out. What's the matter with you? Senator Franco? Who is this? It's Guilhermina. Who? You forget me, you dog? It's Mina. How did you get this number? I know people. What do you want? I don't know, just to chat. I've missed you. Why haven't you visited me? Ok, that's good idea. How's your stock of panties? I miss our times. You know Franco. We were a great team. Don't you agree? Listen, I'm presiding the social welfare commission, you see? I'm very busy, I can't talk. Mina, I still don't get it. What's going on? What's wrong? What happened? Did someone mess with her? Déia, what happened? He continues charging me for tampons, I can't pay. Suck his dick or just bleed. I'll never do that! Do you understand?! Never! Ass hole, I told you not to charge for the fucking tampons! What, bitch?! Son of the bitch! Take her to the hole! Worm! Take her too! You come with me. Now, dammit! Why don't you try that with me, motherfucker? Valtinho is beating Déia, Mina! You motherfucker! I'll get you, I'll get you! I know that you're there, you bastard! I'll get you! Do you hear me? I'll get you! Mina, it's been three days. How much longer will you take it? I don't like to do that to you, Mina. We're friends. When are you going to cooperate and give me the information that I need? Fuck you! You don't understand. I'm going to have fun with you. Do what you want. Valtinho, the doll needs a beauty treatment. No! No! Stop! Try that with me, you motherfucker! Go, give it to the gorilla. When you are ready to talk, you know where to find me. Fuck you! What's going on, Mina?! Talk to me! No! I brought your food. Good, c'mon. Eat it. Eat. You've got to be strong, kid. Mina, you gotta eat. Take this, it will lower your fever. C'mon, take it. Please. Now, you gotta stay strong, understand? Great. Come in. So? Not yet. Let her starve. Do you wish to say something? Fuck... ...you. So? It's not working. Release them tomorrow. Go, woman, don't give him pleasure. Do you need a medic? I'm all right. I just need a shower and some sleep. Never thought that I'd miss the bed in my cell. Mina. Beth. You should eat, Beth. I'm not hungry. Meet Martona. Pleasure. I gotta get out of here. So, you have a plan? Not yet, but soon I will. Time will tell. Time. Why is she here? She is innocent. I like people like her. Smart. When she arrived, she stared at me for three days without one word. That pissed me off. Then, out of nowhere she cracks a smile and and says, "Stick with me, blackie, that you will be fine." I thought she was crazy and started laughing. She was scared, but never showed. She needed someone to protect her ass. And I needed a friend. Hey, it's going to rain. So, what about it? The rain is good. It washes away the dirt. Shit, the hole fucked up your brains. The party is over. Back to your cell. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Whiff... Whiff... Lock! Lights! Damn, she's stinking. What a skank! What tool, man! You got it. I like her. Me, too. Mina, what do you miss the most, huh? Damn, Martona, I don't know, what a stupid question at this time. You tell me, you don't miss freedom? I miss it, but mostly sex. Sex doesn't count. What else? A fine dinner in a fancy restaurant with a gorgeous, polite and ellegant man, good wine and a little hump for dessert with the check. You ain't weak, huh partner? And you? For real. Watch my Vascão at Maracan? Drinking cold beer, curse at the motherfucking refferee. Damn, samba school, Mina. And beach, I miss the beach. Oh, drop this. I know inside is a happy person. You're tripping, Martona. Pass the ball, glue hand. Dammit, Martona, you have to drool all over it. My bad. Shut up, dammit. I have to work tomorrow! All right, public clerk! Stewardess! Pass the lighter. I wish I had a family, you know? With kids and all. I wish. How about you? No, damn. I'm too ugly for that. Yeah, I won't have time. Out the bull shit, Mina. Damn, I'm thirty five, Martona. When I leave here I'll be in menopause. Don't laugh, I'm serious, dammit. Mina, you wanna hear a good one? I had a dick friend before coming here. It was a great friend! I'm serious, a shipyard mechanic. What a bastard? He never visited me here. Men don't visit women in jail. And they talk of rehabilitation. They end your life in here, your shine. It's only humilliation. I don't get how somebody leaves a shithole like this any better. This sac of shit, this bucket of shit, it's all shit! Come with me, Martona. Dammit, what is this shit? What is it? Hey, I came to pay you. So, are we cool? Bastard! Give me the stick, or I'll break your arm. Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Bleed! Bleed, you motherfucker! Bleed, cow! So, doll? You smell good. Let's see what you can do without Martona! You wanna see? So see! Mina, Preta is dead. How come, Preta is dead? I just stuck her leg. I don't know, the doctor said her femoral burst and she bled out. Motherfucker! Geraldo will use this against you! He's framing you. Yeah, Mina, it's getting hard to protect you. I know. Look, you gotta get out of here, now! I'll solve this mess. Go ahead. Go. Go. Let's get out. Go, go. You, bitches got to wake up! Go, go, go. You're going the hole. Go! Go! Go! And no dinner! You wanna talk with me? You know that Preta is dead; and you are the principal suspect. It's war that you want?! What are you talking about? You know damn well! Tell Senator Franco that his time is coming and yours, too, my friend. What makes you think that I can't end it now? Two little girls who live at 3750 Lúcio Costa avenue. You wouldn't have the guts. Try me. What do you want? Help me flee. No, this is out of question! Two little girls who live at 3750 Lúcio Costa avenue. Let me see what I can do. You might. Who is it? Hello, it's Geraldo. The situation is out of control. I agree, I want her head. It's not that easy. It has to look like an accident, otherwise there will be headlines. I don't want to know what you have to do! There's no way out. If you don't I'll fuck with you, you hear me? I want more money. You, fuck! Do you really think you can black mail me? I have a plan, but there has to be something more for me. How much? A million. Wow! You earned forty two millions with the welfare scheme, a million is nothing to you. Leave it to me, I have a plan, that won't fail. Geraldo, you're a mean kid. You know that right? All right, if you do what I want, I'll give your million. You have one last chance. Barney, did you score a foreigner? Are you going to score a foreigner? Oh yeah. What language do you want do speak? English? Portuguese. You already speak Portuguese. No, I wanna score a Portuguese. Oh, with a big mustache? You wanna be bashed by the Portuguese! She wants to get tickled by the mustache. It's because they have bakery! Oh, fatty, son of the bitch! So, the Portuguese burglar, grabbed the phone and called the bank: "Good morning, is there a guy in front of you with a mustache?" The clerk said "Yes". So, the Portuguese on the phone yelled: "This is a robbery, give the money to the guy, or I'll kill you." He got the money? He didn't get the money; it's a joke, dammit. Oh, a joke! So, blood, are you cool? Are you kidding? Twice in a row in the hole, nobody can take that. What were you laughing at? Beth was telling a joke. I'm not in a mood for jokes. Beat it. Beat it. Ok, we need to talk. What's up? Damn, jail just isn't a hotel, and this is fucking suffering. We have to get out of here, I can't take it anymore. Nothing personal, just doing my job. So, how was it? Exciting. Do what I told you, and it'll be all right. Thanks, employee. There's something stinky here. May be your cunt. Shit, shut up, girls! Why are stopped we here? So long, suckers! We're out! Let's go, girls. Go, man! Motherfucker! Geraldo screwed us. He cut the fucking gas. Can you fix it? Yeah, but I gotta get out, and open the hood. We can't stay here. What do we do, now? Run! Let's borrow that. Do you know how to drive it? You know a better time to learn? Get out of the way! Break this shit, dammit! Go, go! C'mon. Dammit, we rather fucking run. Relax, enjoy the ride. Let's go. Ju, where are you? I'll be there soon. Where are we going? Get rid of this truck. Damn, look at this chopper. Oh, Beth, not a good idea, don't do it, man. Why? Get off of my bike, girl! Say what? I told you. Get off of my fucking bike! It's okay, it's okay. My little sister! My bad for the bike. I'm Beth. It's ok. Let's go. Damn, Ju, this is a pig sty. You should take a shower, change clothes. C'mon, I'll take care of you. Hey, is there any beer in this joint? In the fridge. Cool. Brings us some. I'll think about it. I kept some old clothes. It's good to have you back. Thanks. It's over. It's all right, You won't get sad, will you?! Enjoy your freedom! Ju, this will pursue me forever. Oh no, cut the ridiculous philosophy. Have a cold one with me. Hey, this chicken is good, huh? It's a chic. Oh, lot's of difference; chicken, chic. Hey, Martona, your business is to eat the chic, huh? Chic for me is cock, partner. No, no. I'm your cock, dammit! A toast, a toast. To the cock, to the cock, to the cock. A toast to the cock. Don't look at me. I swear that I don't know anything about their escape. Please, I'm telling the truth. They never tell me anything. Sit down. I'm commissioner Bandeira. I know who you are. I have a witness that says that you helped Mina escape. Look here, I don't give a damn about losing this shitty job. And you can't use what you learned from Barney against me. She was tortured. So, if you don't have anything... this canary won't sing! Get out. Oh, darn. Why don't you cut this crap? Because it relaxes me, dammit. Stop this shit! Oh, c'mon, dammit? You're not my mother! In spite of these clothes. Yeah, she looks like Madre Teresa of Bogot? Calcutá, Martona. The same, it's all in Bolivia, isn't it? This shit affects your brains, give it to me. Give me this shit. What is it? What are you laughing at? It was funny. I don't think it's funny at all! Look hottie, you stay cool because I didn't like you since the start. Hey, who will pay for my cue? What fucking cue? I don't like her, Mina. She's all right, Ju, she's just high. Let's drink. Give me another one, Basalto. Wait, wait, darling. Oh, motherfucking music. Who is it?! It's me, Beth. Oh Beth, why didn't you call before? I didn't have a chance. What was with that escape, Franco? Geraldo tried to screw me! It had to look real, Beth. If Mina got wasted, wouldn't be that bad? What do you say? Look here, if you put me in the line of fire again, our deal is over, ok?! No, it won't happen again, take it easy. What Mina is up to? I don't know yet, but she's up to something. I'll find out what. If you don't get the proofs that she has against me, you won't get your fucking dough! Don't fuck with me, Franco. You know my situation. I need this money. I took her out of jail. Hey, you owe me anyway for Geraldo's death. What's she doing back there? I gotta go. Who were you talking to? It's none of your business. - What's up? - What's up? Here it is. It's ok. I want to get laid tonight. Come again, Martona? I like the man. What's his story, huh, Ju? Chumaço works for me. Doing what? All kinds of jobs. Oh, even sex? Including sex. Wait, cutie. What's that, Jullienne? I'm not for sale, especially for her! Do you have a problem with me, man?! No, no I don't. But it so happens that I'm not a gigolo, ma'am. Ju, I want to buy the man. Now! The man is expensive. How expensive? The man costs about... A hundred. C'mon, you're breaking me. I don't have a hundred bucks to buy the man. Oh, Martona, so you won't have the man. I'm sorry. Let's do this, Ju, I'll pay you later. Chumaço is a gift for my partner. Great, friend. You're real blood. So, come with me, man, you'll take away seven years of drought. Negron?! What you want?! It's me, Ju. I know, but I'm busy! Get out, I wanna talk to you. I'm leaving, ok? I'm leaving. So? What you want?! How's the business? Well, it's slow, slow, slow, slow. If I catch you robbing me again, man, I'll kick your ass. Hey, hey, where are you going, Xavier? Where's my money? I just have a hundred. You did what I asked? No, no, not yet, but I'll do it now. What are you doing here? I, I came to take a piss. Ok, ok, I'll do it now. Now, go, go, go. You like the bathroom? Well, it's kind of cute. Go! Get out of here! On the house. Oh, cool! Now, you come with me. I'll take you to a nice place. Oh, I like it. Wake up! Wake up, Cinderella! So, Franco? I already bought your panties. I have a surprise for you. Wake up. Daddy wants to talk to you Dad? Dad, get me out of here, dad. We got your son. Now hear me, bastard?! I was your bitch through those years, and you didn't recognize what I did for you. I kept my mouth shut, Franco. I was loyal to you. And how do you thank me?! By trying to end my life?! You're a hippocrite! Bastard! It's over. I'm in charge. I want my money tomorrow night, no police, only you. Are you listening?! All right. Mina listen, I'll pay you what you want. But don't hurt my son. If you don't do what I'm telling you, I'll kill your son! No, Mina. I'll cooperate. Mina, I won't call the police, I won't take the police. Please, Mina, don't hurt him. It depends on you, Franco. If the proofs that I have against you don't make you respect me, maybe now, you'll give me your total attention. Tomorrow, I'll call to let you know. If I know him well, he won't do anything that I say. And he will not pay me. But this time I'm ahead of him. I'll have a beer. I'll have one, too. We need to talk, Mina. I'll go out for a smoke. Mina, my intuition says that Beth is not who she claims she is. This woman saved my skin, Ju. It doens't make any sense. Why did she help you? Because, we got along since the start. She wanted to escape, and I was the one who was in charge inside prison. It was good for her to be close to me. I don't see anything wrong with that. No, I don't know. I have had this sort of intuitions since I was a kid. You know damn well. I'm always right. Maybe this time your intuition could be wrong, Ju. She took a risk for me, she was in the line of fire during our escape, and then you tell that she isn't right, dammit? I'm grateful for her. Maybe she's not the most perfect person in the world, but she's in our side. Hello. You know that I'm not fooling around, don't you? Listen: If anything happens to my son, you will suffer. I'll kill you, do you understand? I'll kill you. No, you won't. If you don't show up tonight with my money... besides you losing your son, the truth of our scheme will appear in every newspaper. Tell me what to do. I'll let you know later where to meet me, alone. Franco! Don't forget my panties. Don't worry, your excellency, we'll get them. Franco arrived. Is he alone? It looks like. Here in the back it's all good. Ok, tell me if anything happens. Got it. Welcome, Senator. I was waiting for you. Follow me, please. Hey, hold it for me, please. It's crowded. No, no, he didn't come alone. An undercover cop just entered. Cool, isn't it? Liking the ride, congressman? They entered in the emergency room, commissioner. We're on our way. Copy that. How can I help you? How can I help you, sir? Come with me, I need your help. What's happening? I said come with me. Did anything happen? Something very weird just happened, a nurse that I never saw here. entered the elevator, closed the door without waiting for me. Was she alone? No, she was with a man. Where did they go? Forth floor. Forth floor, Commissioner, they're on the forth floor. Follow them. We're on our way. The cavalry arrived. Now it's with me. Good luck. Take care, ok? I'll wait for you at home. Shit! It came from the elevator. Mina. Mina. Be careful. My money? My son? You didn't think that I'd bring him here? He's is in safe place. I'll give you the money, when I know that my son is all right. Do you have a gun? I have. The suitcase, Franco, now! What is this shit?! Where's my money?! Where's my son?! You're asking! The cops are coming, Mina. Let's split, now. You're our passport out of here. Go, let's go. No, no, no, this is not a good idea. - Fuck, Chumaço. - Come, come, come with me. Fuck! Okay, got it, I know where it is. Come with me. Let's go, rebel. Freeze! Be cool, be cool. Easy. Easy. You loose! On the ground arms spread! Arms on the ground! Do it! Let's go, bitch. To the hatch. Let's go, bitch. And my son? Don't worry, Senator. Beth told us, and my team is getting him now. And the scum? They were dead after confrontation with the police. Where we lost one of us. You take care of me and I'll take care of them. We settle it later. Let's go. Recovered by (c) dCd / March 2019
