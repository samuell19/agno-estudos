You've worked so hard for so long, I just can't believe... Mom. Air? Honey, you look beautiful. Thanks! So, what got you to finally dress up for dinner? Audrey told me that Jenny Fallon invited me to her party. That sounds like fun. Why didn't Jenny invite you herself? I don't really know her, but she saw my Dunforth acceptance post on Instagram. I've gotten more likes than I've ever got before. Do you have time to still celebrate with us tonight? Well, I was going to meet Audrey before the party. But of course I do!

At least you didn't add hashtag "grateful" to your Instagram. I would have had to kill you. I am grateful. Grateful to be getting out of this place. Sometimes it can just be so... high school. Listen to you. All grown up. Oh Audrey, I forgot to ask... Did you hear from Dunforth? Yeah, I got wait-listed. But there's still a chance, right? Of course. They'd be crazy not to accept you. I'm sure the letter is in the mail right now. I don't know, that whole gap year idea is sounding pretty good. No! We're going to college together, just like we planned. Okay. To us. Killing it. To us. Peyton, Audrey. Congrats on Dunforth. Thanks. Did you hear back from Stanford yet? Still waiting. Tick-tock. I only check my cell every three seconds. Everybody's hearing back late. It's so nerve racking. I'm going to go find Jenny. Okay. You look really pretty tonight. I mean, you always look pretty but, you know what I mean. Thank you. You want to dance? Nobody's dancing.

Let's go. Wow, totally unexpected. Let's go! Wonder why she isn't awake? She's usually awake by now. I think we need to cut her a little slack this morning. She rolled in 45 minutes past curfew, which I let slide this one time, I think she might need a little extra TLC this morning. A get out of jail free card? I'm okay with that.

I'll see you at lunch. Yeah! Peyton! Hey! How was the rest of your weekend? Not bad. I can't complain. The best part is, this guy I know sent me some nice messages. Yeah? I heard he's a pretty good kisser. Well, you can't tell from just one kiss. I should go. Oh! Did you do that Spanish homework? Si, bonita senorita. Si. Adios. Bye. Peyton? What's going on? I just got this email. I don't know... I don't understand. Who sent that email? The sender ID was blocked. Oh, my god... this can't be happening. Where are you going? I have to get home... now. Why are there naked pics of you? Where did they come from? They were on my phone, but I deleted them so this wouldn't happen. Were they for that plastic surgery site? Yes, but I didn't even post them on the site, I just had them in my computer. They were private, they were just for me! I don't understand. Who got these photos? How did they get sent out to everyone? This is so messed up. Oh my god. I think I'm going to be sick. The photos, they were also posted on my Facebook. And I just got an email with four more. I think everybody's getting them. No... no! Are you okay? I've got to get home. Hi! Hey hon, how's everything coming along? It's great, how about you? How's our college girl? She's great, she'll be home in a couple of hours. I was thinking about making something different, but I'm just going to make her favorite. Lemon shrimp scampi with linguine? Nice. Exactly. You home soon? Yeah I'm just wrapping up. I will be home in an hour with a big old smooch. Don't make promises you can't keep. You just wait and see. Set your watch. Bye. Okay, buh-bye. Dammit! Hey David, I just got an email about Peyton. We all did. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry you got what, sir? Photographs of your daughter. I'm sorry, I need to go home. Yeah, you should do that. Elaine? Yes, I saw it. The whole goddamn company saw it! Did you talk to Peyton? What the hell is going on? This is a nightmare, David. Who saw these pictures? I don't know, I'm on my way. Be there as fast as I can. She just got home, I gotta go. Tell me what is going on. What are these photos? I don't know what's going on. Did you take naked pictures of yourself? Did somebody take pictures of you? Nobody took photos of me. I took them... but they were just supposed to be for me. Why would you do that? Before college I was going to talk to you... about maybe getting my boobs done... What? Why honey? You're perfect. I took the photos for the doctor's consultation, I was having fun and I got a little carried away. But I deleted them and I never uploaded them to the site. I swear, I deleted them so nobody could even accidentally see them. This isn't making any sense. How could somebody break into your computer and steal your photos? I don't know. Why would they show them to your father and I? They sent them to everybody. All of my friends got emails and text messages. Everybody. School? Yeah. Oh my god, this isn't happening. What is that? What is this website... what is this? I don't know. Who else got this email? Oh my god... Walnut Grove High School, Dr. Peterson, Aunt Betty and Uncle Ed, even Pastor Bridges got this... And dad's boss... What the hell happened? She wanted to get her breasts done? Did you know about this? No, David, I did not. Just calm down. We need to do something about this. She's never been in any trouble before. She's already an adult. Let's focus on fixing the problem. Elaine, there's no fixing it. These photos got sent to the whole world, even Mr. Tate. Then he should understand. He has a daughter. It could happen to anyone. Yeah, anyone who takes pictures of themselves, naked. Now you're judging her!

My daughter's computer was hacked and personal photos were stolen and sent out to everybody that we know. Now there are compromising photos of her on No, she's 18. Well, yes, I realize that makes her an adult... Really? I see... Okay... okay... right. Thank you so much for your time. Apparently it's beyond their jurisdiction and they can't help us. There's no point in filing a report unless there's fraud or money stolen. But they did suggest we call the Cyber Crimes Division and they gave me a website. They said there's an office down at the Federal Building. You've got to be kidding me. Honey, how're you feeling? I don't know... I couldn't sleep. My phone has been overrun by texts. Just turn it off tonight. I did. I'm never turning it on again. You're getting a new cell number anyhow because of all this. The Cyber Crimes Division office opens at 8 AM tomorrow. We'll go down there after we talk to your principal and we'll file a report. First off, why on earth would you want to change yourself? You're so beautiful just the way you are. Dad, please. Not now. These photos... I understand they get sent to kids at school because they're on your contact list, but how did they end up at my firm? Because I did that internship there last summer, and I added everybody on Facebook. Their emails are attached to Facebook and the other social media sites. How many times have we told you nothing online is private anymore? Apparently there's an epidemic, okay? This is happening every moment on the internet. I was just reading an article about a website that was hacked where over 200,000 photos were stolen. Damn it, you're smarter than this Peyton, come on! Dad, this isn't my fault. I know! Look, you're my daughter... all I want to do is protect you and find out who is behind this... and I just want to make them pay. My computer must have been hacked. That is the only explanation I can come up with. That makes sense, we believe you. You know that we're by your side and we'll get through this together... no matter what happens. I love you. I love you, too. It's okay. I'm sorry... this is stupid. I'm sorry we're meeting under such serious circumstances. This is a very distressing time for all of us. Peyton's situation has disrupted the entire school. Hold on, wait a second. This is not Peyton's fault. She's the victim here. I do apologize, Mr. Harris. I don't mean to point the finger solely at Peyton... but do you understand how many incidents like this have occurred at Walnut Grove? These kids aren't making it easier for any of us... I didn't mean... by sharing every detail of their lives. They don't realize that this stuff doesn't just go away. Yeah, but my computer was hacked and those photos were stolen. They were just my private photos. But did you take the photos? Well, yeah. Did you send them to a boyfriend and forget? Or to Shutter Mug as a joke? Peyton doesn't have a boyfriend. This is ridiculous! David! Mr. Harris, I'm simply trying to find out how this happened and what we can do to help Peyton move forward. I don't know who did this. Peyton, you've been an exemplary student... and I believe your side of the story. I think it's in Peyton's best interests to stay out of school until this blows over. I have taught high school... I tend to agree with Mr. Harris, I don't believe running or hiding from your problems is ever the answer. But how am I supposed to get through my classes? Everybody's going to be laughing at me, making fun of me. Peyton, I'm truly sorry this is happening to you. If you ever need any help, my office door is always open. Your teachers and your counselor are here for you too. Thank you. Okay then, how do we take this sleaze ball down? Have you even seen this website? Yes, Mrs. Harris, I'm very familiar with it and Carl Cooke. We've been after him for quite some time. They're calling it revenge porn, it can't even be legal. They have clearly violated my daughter's privacy. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get Cooke on anything he's posted to his website. It's basically social networking, twisted yes, but hard to prove illegal. My daughter's privacy has been violated! There is no online privacy anymore. Look I hate to sound harsh, but do you have any idea how many anonymous photo sending apps exist? People need to realize if they're gonna send those photos, they now become public property. It's very hard for us to prove that a crime has been committed. My daughter's photos were stolen. I can't believe you're honestly telling me there's nothing you can do for me. If this would've happened a year ago when your daughter was a minor, you would've had every resource, every cop, every cyber forensics team come out of the woodwork to nail the pedophile. I know it sounds crazy, but that's the law. So you're telling us we have to let him keep doing what he's doing and get on with it? That's not what I'm saying. Yeah, that is what you're saying. You have to understand that Cyber Crimes cases alone hit 20,000 last year. We're overwhelmed and the bad guys know it. Thank you for your help, Agent Keller. We're just extremely frustrated. I know and I understand that. I appreciate you filing the report, at least we now have a case number that we can follow up on. We're gonna check your computers for malware. In the meantime, please don't use the Internet. Trust me Peyton, I want to take down this scumbag Cooke as bad as you do. Somewhere along the line, he will mess up and we will nail him. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Who else was on the mass email? Kelly Manners? She's on the yearbook staff with me. Next. Next one: Steven Jones. I went to camp with him when I was like, twelve. Oh god. If it's him, I've lost all faith in humanity. Someone needs to shut this site down, immediately. I started Ex-my-ex when me and a couple of buddies were hanging out getting trashed because I just been dumped. This bitch burned me bad and I wanted revenge. We had this domain we were working on, but it wasn't going anywhere. We just thought it would be funny to throw a couple of nude pics of my ex-bitch on this site. Then I had this massively clever idea of attaching it to her Facebook and Twitter pages which opens up phone, email, everything. Click one button, those pics are sent off and she was screwed. My coding was so genius. From there, it just blew up and the rest is history. What a disgusting example of a human being. Hey. Hey. Any breakthroughs? This Carl Cooke is such a douche bag. He's pure evil. Oh my god, I can't look at that. Turn it off. We have to take this bastard down. Obviously no one's gonna help us. Peyton needs to put this behind her before college. Why don't we just appeal to the website server? This kind of thing can't be good for business, right? That's a brilliant idea. I'll call them in the morning. Okay. I knew I married you for some reason. Brains and brawn, baby! Morning! Morning. It is a good morning. It worked. You were right, I called them, they took Peyton's pictures down 15 minutes after I called them. They also sent a cease and desist letter to Carl Cooke. That's the best news I've heard in a long time. Hey Peyton, great news. Now what? You might want to sit down for this. C'mon seriously? Just tell me. I called the server that hosts the Ex-my-ex website. I told them the situation and they took down all the pictures. All of your pictures are off of the site. Oh my god, are you serious? Mom, you did it! Your father's a genius. I'm taking you guys out for dinner tonight. Bye! You don't have to go to school until after third period, okay? Why don't you take a quick speed walk with me? It will get your day started right. Could I maybe please go back to sleep for another hour? C'mon, don't make me do this walk by myself. Okay, fine. I'm so happy! I love you. Back at ya, baby. Morning. Peyton? Peyton! What? Just go back to the house. Go! Why? What's happening? They're up... the pictures are back up. C'mon honey. How is this possible? Oh god. Why would someone do this? Why are you ruining my life? Audrey, you got them too? I'm so screwed, why would he put the photos back up? I'm so sorry. Yeah, it looks like everybody got them again. Are you coming in to school today? I don't know, I can't miss my classes. How am I supposed to make it through the day? I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. Bye. You promised me that my daughter's pictures would be taken down and would stay down. Now they're back up and there's more of them. This is absolutely insane... what do you mean he put them back up? I thought that you were in charge of your server. Okay, thank you. Those photos... they're everywhere. He put them everywhere. You lied! You said that he took them down! David, you have to come home right now. Okay, come on. I'll drive you to school, you can still make third period. How am I supposed to face my friends? I can't do it, dad. We cannot let this pervert win. This is no time to give up. You've got the truth on your side, hon. I don't think I'll make it through the day. Yes, you will, you're a Harris. You're Peyton Elizabeth Harris. These kids have known you since kindergarten. They know exactly who you are. Your mom's right, you need to face this head on. I know it's hard, but you can't hide from this forever. Why not? Come on, let's go. Fine. All right, have a good day. Hey! You got this. Hey. Hi. What is this? Looks like one of your classroom displays. All those years of being a high school history teacher are finally paying off. Welcome to my Cyber Command Central. Wow, you've been busy. Looks like you've got it all figured out, Mom. This piece of crap is going to go down. You have no idea what he does to people. He runs no less than ten websites, shares pictures amongst them, he's just screwing with these women to make a profit. Okay babe. Peyton's had a rough day. Why don't we give her a break from all this for awhile? I can grab a pizza, maybe a movie, does that sound good? Yeah, sounds great. What kind? I dunno, maybe pepperoni. No olives this time. No olives? Okay. Yeah, pizza sounds great. I'll be right back. I'm so tired. Delivery! Yes! Pizza, yes. Come now. Here you go, ladies. Thank you! Here dad, have some. I'm just gonna get some drinks. I'll get it. No it's okay, I'm already up. Yeah? Yes, Elaine. Jane? Hi. You must be Elaine. Yes, thank you for coming. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. So Cooke's infected your lives, too? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your daughter. He's like this virus that's impossible to get rid of. This has all been so upsetting. I lost my job, I was humiliated. And I did nothing wrong, I swear. I mean, I understand... So, where are you at now in your case? Family court of appeals. I haven't seen my kids in three months, it's killing me. I can imagine. I was working at Santa Christa County Hospital. I was in the pediatric unit. All I ever wanted to do. I love those kids. I love my job... I loved my job. I got carried away one night at this guy's house. We were drinking, got a little wild and had sex on his dining room table. He took pictures with my phone. I've always been very shy. My friend suggested taking some sexy pictures... you know, just for myself... to kind of open me up a little. Gain some confidence. And so I did. What went wrong? I mean, the pictures were pretty bad. But it got worse when my ex got hold of my phone a few days later. He posted the pictures on Ex-my-ex just so he could make me look bad in the custody case. And guess what? It worked. A month later, I start getting emails and texts saying naked photos of me had been sent. I was brought in front of the board of the hospital. They didn't want me around the kids anymore. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I just can't. I'm sorry. Absolutely. If it'll help me get my kids back, I'll do anything. I think the way to get this guy is through these hacking cases. I researched and I found ten cases where people's pictures ended up on his sites and their computers were hacked. If we can find the common thread tying them to Cooke... we can use that thread to string him up by his balls? I knew I liked you. George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River... Okay, settle down people. December 25-26, 1776. Okay that is enough. That's enough! Put your phone away. All of you put your phones away. Peyton, is everything okay? I don't know. Why don't you hit the library and get some space from this? Thank you. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Open your books up to page 29. Thank god you're here. I forgot you had a free fourth. You know me, livin' the dream. But, wait. You don't have a free fourth. Why are you here? Redwitz basically gave me a hall pass. It sucks. I can't even get through a class. Whatever. You should go tell Principal Duncan. What? No way. I don't want to add more attention to myself. It's too late for that. I don't know how you're keeping it together. I'm not. I'm trying to be strong, but this whole, "the truth is on your side" thing is B.S. Nobody cares about the truth. It's easier for everyone believe this is all my fault and somehow I brought this on myself for attention. I know it's really rough, but come on, you don't think you're partly responsible for what's happening just the tiniest bit? What? No. 100% no. How can you even say that? I mean... you admitted that you took those pictures for your boob job. So? People do crazy things when they're drunk. I don't even know what to say. The last person in the world I thought still had my back. I do. But you're more popular than ever here at school and well, you're kind of playing the victim here. I am the victim! There's just so much gossip going on right now, it's hard for everybody to keep it straight. Everybody? Everybody is who you believe over your best friend? Thanks, Audrey. Thanks a lot. Hey you. Colin, hey. How's it going? You holding up? I'm okay. Every day seems to be a new nightmare. Audrey and I just got into a bit of a fight. It just came out of left field. Girls suck. You stab each other in the back all the time. This much, I know for sure. That's a little bit harsh. Yep. It's a little true though, right? Girls do suck... except for you. I'm pretty sure you're cool. You're funny. Thanks for that. You're welcome for that. Don't worry, I got your back. That's really sweet. You don't know how much I needed to hear that today. Good. I'm glad I could make you feel better. I want you to know how much I love the pictures of you. Really hot, I just can't stop looking at them. What? You wanted the attention and now you got it. I can't wait to see the goods up close and personal. Stay away from me, you ass! Bitch! Mom? Dad? I totally get it, of course you're scared. But your story sounds so much like my daughter's. I hope you'll reconsider helping us. It's one of those "safety in numbers" situations... Really? Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much. She's in. We have another recruit for our cause. Great, we need all the help we can get. Safety in numbers. Especially dealing with a creep like Carl. Take a look at this... most of these hacks happened after June of last year. Wonder why that is? There has to be a common thread that links these girls. Elaine, check this out. In May, the traffic on Cooke's website slowed down. That's weird. Before that, his website had a ton of activity driven by crappy boyfriends. It's like he ran out of deviants to fill his site... Unlikely. The world's full of deviant boyfriends... Then this spike shows when the hacks started. It doesn't make sense, the numbers jumping like that. Could be a coincidence, but let's keep digging. Let's focus on the why and when we find that connection, I bet it'll lead to Cooke. It just took off. Sure, there's a lot of angry people out there, but what can I say? These "victims" aren't victims. None of this would have happened if they hadn't taken the pics and sent the photos. They made their bed. Listen. Girls. All you need to do is put down your phone and close your legs. If you did that, I'd be out of business. Hey, these girls need to check their behavior. They deserved to find themselves ruined. What do I care? I just profit from it. Cha-ching. How are things at school? Has the attention died down a bit? That's never gonna happen, but I'm learning a whole lot about my friends. I'm sorry honey, you just haven't mentioned it for the past few days. It's okay, dad, none of this is your fault. It sucks feeling like I have to go through this on my own. You've got Audrey to lean on, right? Nope! She's totally freaked by the whole situation. It's like somehow she's jealous that I'm getting all this attention at school even though it's horrible. You guys have been close since elementary school. That's strange. Did you talk to her about it? I'm done talking, Dad. It's easier for everyone to believe the TMZ version. It's a lot more interesting than the truth. Peyton... Oh my god. Dad, look. We should go. So, custody hearing is in a couple of days. My lawyer is pretty optimistic I'll get my kids back. Good work tonight, ladies. We're really getting somewhere. Same time tomorrow? You bet. Bright and early. Yeah. Bye you guys! Bye! How did it go? Really good, we made some big breakthroughs, progress, definitely. I'm sorry about dinner, again. Whatever, Mom. Hey Peytie, we really could use your help. You know more about social media than all of us put together. We have a lot of information to sift through. I don't think I have the energy for it. I just want all of this to go away. We all do, but that's why we need your help. Peyton's got a full plate right now. Can I see your phone? Don't you want to have a little part in taking this S.O.B. down? Oh my god. Has he contacted you before? I got a text last week. You didn't think it was important enough to tell me? I didn't feel like you needed to worry about it. This guy is obviously not backing down. He's out of control, we need to protect the family. I don't need a lecture David, I need some support. He's shown he's not afraid of anyone, even the police... This is a very dangerous person that's stalking us. He hides behind a computer screen, this scumbag, and I am taking him down... All right, can we just stop all of this! Please! Look, I'll help you, okay? If it'll make this go away, what choice do I really have? It's gonna work out together, you'll see. Okay. If you need me to go to the hearing, I'm available. Of course, I know you'd do the same for me. Hi, can I get a large soy latte with a double shot? Yeah, I'm just getting my fuel for the day. Okay, well let me know. What? That's so strange. Jane, can I call you back? Okay I'll talk to you later. Bye. There must be something wrong with the system. Hi Mr. Stevens, it's Elaine Harris... I wanted to see if you could check into my accounts, something seems to be wrong with my credit cards. I don't understand why they're frozen. Mr. Stevens, someone has hacked into our accounts. You need to take over, you need to stop them. Do you understand? Cooke just escalated this to a whole new level. Hacking into your financial accounts is a federal crime and that's where we jump into action. You wouldn't believe the hours I spent at our bank trying to untangle this mess. Oh, I'm sure, Mr. Harris. We've been in touch with the district manager and he's going to provide evidence for us to build our case. Agent Keller, I am worried about the safety of my family. We have no idea what Cooke's going to do next. That's why I asked Elaine to back off her investigation. This was obviously some sort of retaliation. I can't back down now. I keep finding new things with the girls every day. I'll admit, Mrs. Harris, I'm very impressed with the information you provided about Cooke. It's helped us paint a better picture of this monster. But clearly, the more we push, the harder he strikes back. Isn't Elaine interfering with your investigation? You're a private citizen, Mrs. Harris. Feel free to search any internet site, as long as you don't break the law. So what do we do now, Agent Keller? Every night I come home, I expect to find this guy on my front porch. On the record, Mr. Harris, I can't tell you what to do. But off the record? Protect your family by any means necessary. Oh, well that's great. I'll be outside. I'm worried about Peyton. I want her straight home after school until this is all over. And I want her to take a different route. Why? Do you think he's following her? No, it's just a precaution. We should be extra careful through all this. Who is it? We have to get home now. Who is it? Carl. He's not giving up that easy. Another text from him. I don't know what this means. "You're it?" What the hell is that? It's a drone! Smash it! I will, hold on. It's gotta be Cooke. Hang on! Laugh it up while you can, baby. Because reality really sucks. ♪ Frightening music What? No... no... no! You bastard! Right, I understand. Thank you for your time, officer. Any options? Sadly, no. It's impossible for them to trace it after the fact. We're just lucky it didn't cause an accident. That's it? Cooke wins again? The police are right. If we can't prove who's flying it, it's our word against his. I don't understand that. Look! Read that. He's just destroyed my entire life! We'll call the admissions counselor in the morning and they will change it back. Did you read the email? They gave away my slot and the scholarship. That's it, it's done. He won. Peyton... we'll fix it! No you won't. Well, what a surprise. You haven't answered my texts. I'm sorry... everything's been overwhelming lately. Jenny's having a party, I told Audrey to tell you about it. Really? Well, she never did. Come over, it's two blocks from your house. Okay, I will. Nothing's happening huh? This looks like something. Yeah, I got invited a few minutes ago and drove over. You guys don't want to get involved. Go inside, I'll be there in a minute. What's going on with you, Audrey? We've been through everything together and now when I need you the most, you completely bail? I've been there for you every single time that you need me. Remember the cheating incident? I still haven't told a soul about that. You know this bastard hacked into the college computer system and gave away my scholarship. They gave my spot to somebody else. Oh, my god, Peyton. I didn't know. Come on. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. Peyton, you're right. I've been horrible to you. I know that you didn't sent those photos, because I did... Why? Do you have any idea how hard it's been living in your shadow? Of course you don't. Ever since kindergarten you were the star. I was always second, third, or fourth to your first place. Spelling bees, math tests, swim meets... You always finished on top. You're supposed to be my best friend. I wanted you to get a taste of what it's like for me... maybe knock you off that perfect pedestal for just a minute. How could you do this to me? I had a horrible impulse in the moment. I wasn't thinking... You walked out of the room... I was on your laptop, I was gonna save some party pics for you from Facebook, but I found "THE NEW ME" folder and those photos... And I did it, I sent them to that Shutter Mug site. I don't know what came over me, but I regretted it the second I hit send. Peyton, you have to believe me. I removed them right away, so I don't even know how they got on this guy's website. Somebody must've screenshotted them. Will you shut up! You've ruined my life. You know that right? Now me and my family are in danger because of what you did. And you made me believe that somehow this was my fault? What is wrong with you? There's nothing I can say to make this right. But just please believe that I'm sorry... I really am sorry. I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth. Peyton, I will do anything. I can make it up to you, let me help... There's nothing you can do. The damage is done. Why don't you take some pictures of yourself and post them online? Then you'll know how I feel. I'm so sorry about Audrey. It's unlike her to do something so horrible. She was like my sister. I know... Morning, Jane. I'm a mess. What's wrong? That son of a bitch judge denied my request for joint custody. He said no. Oh god, Jane, I'm so sorry. That's horrible. He thinks I'm an unfit mother. Hank is taking the kids and moving them to Arizona. I don't know what else to do. Oh, Jane. I'm never going to see my kids again. Can I come over? Please. I really need to talk. Listen I'm sorry about what's happened to you. Things have not been safe around here lately. Peyton is having a rough time and she needs me, so... I'm sorry. I understand... Let's talk later. We'll figure out a way to get your kids back. Everything okay? Yeah. They can't get me on unlawful images because I didn't steal any of the pictures. I just gave A a place to screw over B. I'm untouchable and untraceable, bitches. My reach is far and wide. Think about that the next time you leave the nest. Tune in next week, maybe it's your ex we toast. You've gotta be kidding me. You got a tail light out. License and registration please, sir. You got it. Here you go, officer. Thank you... thank you so much. Hands where I can see them! Step out of the vehicle. What did I do? You got a warrant for domestic violence against your wife. No, you're making a mistake, officer. You like to beat women senseless? Put your hands behind your back. You've got the wrong guy. David Harris? You made bail. Come with me. Thank god they take credit cards to post bail. I called Agent Keller. He is working with them to figure out how Cooke hacked their system. If the police aren't safe from this guy, what chance do we have? This filth has taken over our family with a click of a mouse. He doesn't have to come down here and fight us in person, he can do it all from the comfort of his own house. Look at our house? Look what he has done to us? We are obsessed with him. David, enough. We've given all of the power to Cooke... That's what he wants, clearly. It's like we're fighting a ghost. How long do we have to keep doing this? Until he's behind bars. Dad, I know that you're frustrated, but we're not gonna give up now. You want me to be one of those girls who falls apart and surrenders? No way. We are going to nail this guy, remember? Peyton, it is not a fair fight. We are losing. We only lose if we give up. I want to do whatever it takes to catch him. Honey, I'm your father. I'm supposed to be protecting you, I can't even do that right now. You were the one who told me to face this head on. We have the truth on our side, remember? You said that. Let's get this guy. Okay? Please dad. Okay. Who is this? The Grim Reaper. Leave Carl Cooke alone or you will feel my wrath. You're all gonna burn in hell and I'm going to light the match. David! Both of you okay? We're okay. This was on my windshield, one of my tires was slashed. Somebody called here with a death threat. My email, Twitter, they're full of death threats. Did you call Agent Keller? He said to shut down our social media, including our emails until further notice. Okay, until Cooke is behind bars, we are off the grid. Bye you guys, cya later. Elaine... or do you still insist I call you Miss Forster? I'm going to call the police. You've seen what good that does. You must get tired of hiding behind your drones and computers. What do you want? How quickly we forget. History class? You were the sweet young teacher and I was the horny freshman in the front row. And damn was I ever hot for you. Eddie? You're Eddie Cooke? That's right. I was never feeling the Eddie vibe, so I started going by my middle name. I think Carl suits me better. Don't you agree? Why did you choose my daughter to destroy? At first, your sweet little Peyton was just another slut on Ex-my-ex. But then you started messing with my site and I was like, "Who's this bitch?" So I looked through her Facebook page and there you were. Older, but still hot. I couldn't believe it. So this is some kind of sick revenge fantasy? You got me kicked out of school and sent to a juvie hell. I got beat up every day and one guard even had his way with me. You basically ruined my life. Then why go after my family? If this is between you and me, leave Peyton and David alone. You can't keep doing this to us. Don't you see? It's perfect. The universe brought us back together for a reason... So I can ruin your life. Payback's a bitch, Teach. Leave us alone, or I swear to god... God can't help you now! You've seen only a prick of what I can do. I live and breathe code. I can twist the manipulation any way I want. You've seen the power I have over your family. Your entire lives are online. With a few keystrokes, I can flatline you. Get it, sweetheart? I'm the gift that keeps on giving. Okay, so what are we going to do? What did you tell dad? I didn't tell him yet. So, Cooke was your student? It was my first year teaching and, ummm... He had a big crush on me and would write love poems and leave them on the car. He'd draw these explicit and disturbing images. So what did you do? I told him to stop, but it got worse and I had to tell the principal. He expelled Carl and transferred him to another school. So, he waits ten years to get his revenge? I don't think it was planned. I think he saw an opportunity and he took it. I think that's what happened. I thought we changed our accounts? We did... What? Damn you, Cooke. Did Jane contact you about coming this morning? No, I haven't heard from her in a few days. Elaine. Hi, we could use your help this morning. I'm sorry, I can't make it today. C'mon, I need my tiger. Elaine, I can't. I need to get my kids back. That's my only focus right now. But we're so close to nailing this guy. I just can't let Cooke pull my focus from the custody case. I need to put him and all that ugliness behind me. It's about my kids. Did you contact that lawyer David suggested? Yes, and please thank him for me. He thinks we have a really good shot, but there's a lot of work to be done. That's my priority now. Listen, I'm really sorry but need to go. Good luck. I understand, good luck to you too. Elaine? One more thing. Kick his ass. I promise I will. Hey, be careful with my stuff. I'll need it back in about an hour. Don't you guys mess up my good carpet either. Make sure you wear those little white booties. Listen, all we need is a sign off and then we can move forward on it. I get it, but you've had it for two weeks now. I've gotta go, I'll call you back. What's up? I found the missing link. Cooke was working with a hacker. There's a group of women who received an email or a friend request from John Smith. You think this is Carl Cooke? It's very likely. He sent a false hyperlink to them. If you clicked on it, he would get access to anything, everything that he wanted. Have you sent this to Agent Keller? I had the hacking victims document their stories, I sent everything to him. All the dots came together today and they found the connection. Can you prove this? I guess the vengeance business hit a wall. This John Smith was hacking into computers looking for explicit pictures to put on the site for more hits. More pics, more hits, get it? Yeah. We also think he was trolling sites like Shutter Mug and that's how he stole Peyton's pictures. Right. David, the CCD has arrested Carl. So the evil genius is going away? I'm on my way to the Cyber Crimes Division right now. and they've told me I can come watch. Would you care to join me? I would. You ready to do take it down? One hundred percent. Yes, buh-bye. Okay, pull the plug. Voila, website gone. Really? It's just that easy? It is if you know what you're doing. Not very ceremonious, I'll agree, but thanks in large part to you, that website will never see the light of day again. Where is Cooke right now? Down the hall with his lawyer and, unfortunately, he will make bail this afternoon. Absolutely not, you can tell his lawyer "no." Cooke wanted to see you face-to-face. That's not happening. It's against protocol. I would like to see him. Are you serious? Mom, he's dangerous. I want him to see he didn't tear our family apart and that we're stronger now than ever. You were a big part in making this arrest, so I will give you five minutes. It's okay... That's plenty of mine. Elaine! It's fine... really. Follow me. It's okay. What a nice surprise, Miss Forester. Thanks for coming. Sorry, I can't get up. What, no yoga pants today? Too bad, you were looking mighty fine the other day. Total hot MILF. Big words coming from someone in handcuffs. Momentary setback. How's that pretty little Peyton? She is one fine piece of... You bastard, you nearly ruined her life. And you had no problem ruining mine? You've victimized so many women and girls. Destroyed so many families. Do you not have a conscience? Hey, I didn't take the pictures. These bitches did, and did something to piss off their boyfriend or husband bad enough, they posted them on my site. Karma, baby. Yeah? Well look where you're sitting, Mr. Cooke. Don't you worry about me. I'll be outta here in a half hour, just you wait and see. Mrs. Harris, it's time to go. Bitches be going down. Karma. That's the real bitch... And you're the one who's going down. See you online, Teach. Agent Keller said if he gets a plea deal, he'll serve two to seven years. That's not enough by a long shot. The case depends on women testifying at his sentencing hearing. We need to convince the victims that testifying is the only way to put him away. They'll testify, I know it. Hey. How are you? Better. Mom, don't worry. They'll show up, I promise. Two to seven years is what he gets with victim's testimony. If we want him to get the longest sentence possible, we need everyone to show up... and soon. Believe me, they will. Elaine, have some faith. There he is... I'd like to make a statement. These false charges against me will not stick. No one stops Carl Cooke. It's just a bump in my road to success. At this time, I'd like to announce my new website, You're gonna love it... Unless you're the one caught in the act. What an ass. Agreed. I still don't see anybody else. Mom, look... Hi! Nice to meet you. I knew we'd take him down, but now I think we're gonna bury him! Let's do this. Jane! You made it. You didn't think I would let you kick his ass by yourself, did you? No, I did not. You've done this to yourselves. You want justice? Stop taking nude photos. I've broken no laws. I'm the real victim here. This is America and I have rights too. Believe me when I say I'll see you all online real soon. Let's get him! Let's get him! Honey, come down and share a toast with us. It's not the same without you! I'm on my way. I'd say we've earned this? And then some. Hey guys! There she is! I'm officially beat. No cooking for me tonight. Wanna order in? Pizza? Maybe we could get Thai food. I've been craving Pad Thai. Pot stickers... Here's to that cockroach going to prison for the next seven years. Hopefully more time once the police tie him to that drone attack. Here's a thought. Why don't we go downtown tomorrow and watch Carl officially taken into custody? Sounds great. Sorry, I don't think you're going make it tomorrow. Good evening, Elaine. David. Peyton. We finally meet in the flesh, but I've already seen some of your best bits. I'd hate for you to die in front of your family, David. Not just yet. As you know, I'm going to jail tomorrow, but first, I had to pay my last respects. You need help. No, you need help. I've already hacked into your system and disengaged your CO detector. In a moment, I'll turn the valve on this tank and release its goodness. As you lose consciousness, mine will be the last face that you see. I might even post photos... You sick bastard. Carl, please. Please don't do this. Peyton, please. It doesn't do any good to beg. Well, maybe a little begging... It might even turn me on. Now shut up and breathe in deep. Dad! Peyton! Call 911. Hey, Carl! Don't mess with my family. Cooke plead guilty to the three counts of attempted murder and awaits sentencing. These charges are on top of the previous hacking crimes where he was sentenced to seven years. It looks like prison will be his final home. And a lifetime ban on touching any computer devices. No more hacking. He is officially shut down. Watch out for Team Harris. Damn straight. I knew there was a reason why I married you. Beauty and brains? Brawn and brains. Oh my gosh, I'm wounded! And on that note, I'm out, Team Harris. Would you like a ride to school? No, I think I'll walk. Bye! Good morning. Hello. You're not driving to school this morning? You really do notice the little details. I just need some air. Ah, cool. How are you doing? You know, after all that crazy stuff happened? I'm good. It's been an intense couple of months, but I'm glad we're finally in the home stretch. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you more. I guess I didn't know how... No... you were amazing, really. I'm glad I can make you feel better. C'mon seriously? Hold up. Let me get this out. I wanted to ask you something and please know that I've been thinking about this for a long time... it's probably the last thing on your mind... I don't know why I just said all that, but I was thinking, well, more like wondering, if you're free, maybe you'd like to go to prom with me? What? Please don't make me say that again. Why? Why don't I want to say that again or why am I asking you to prom? The second one. Because you're cool. And to continue with my verbal dump this morning... I've always had a crush on you. Really? Before the pictures? Of course. I remember you in our ninth grade class. You'd always chew on your pencil when you were nervous for a test. I thought it was the cutest thing ever. So, what do you say about prom? I'd love to go to prom with you. Cool... that's really cool. May I walk you to school? Sure... but what are they going to say? At school? Yeah. Who cares what they say? You're right... who cares. ♪ Rock music ♪ Rock music ♪ Rock music
