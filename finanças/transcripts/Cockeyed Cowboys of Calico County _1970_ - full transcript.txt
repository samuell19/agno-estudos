"Attention, frontier gentlemen. Ladies... wish to corr... es... pond with... men of good character. Object... matrimony." Huh. "Write to Mrs. Domestic Bliss." Huh. He's comin'! Mr. Bicker's comin'! He got all cleaned up, and he's coming to town! He got shaved! He even took a bath! He's comin'! He's comin'! Mr. Bicker's comin'! He's comin'! He's comin'! Mr. Bicker's comin'! Mr. Bicker's comin'! He's all cleaned up and he's comin' to town! Morning, Charley. Good morning, Mr. Bester, Mrs. Bester. Good morning, Crazy Foot. Hey, you're up pretty early. Appears everybody else is too. I never seen a turnout like this at this hour. Busy little town, all right. Station isn't open yet. What I care? The weekly train gets in at 7:15, you know. So let it. Quite so. Quite so. You won't let anything... interfere with gettin' my wagons ready for Monday, will ya? I need those wagons bad. They'll be ready. Good. We want to wish you well. Splendid thing, marriage. Sherman! Shut up, my dear. Noble state of affairs, marriage. You'll never regret it. Never. We've been... You're not supposed to mention that, Sherman! Henceforth, my precious, I'll thank you to keep your mouth shut... when I'm telling people how happy we are. Crazy Foot, you got anything to say about me gettin' married? Foot crazy, not mouth. Mornin', Charley. Been expecting you. You got it? Come in on the stage yesterday. Genuine six-karat, three-dollar solid gold ring all the way from Abilene. Yeah? Well... Hey, Mr. Fowler, you didn't, by chance, mention to anybody that I was gettin' married, did you? I've had two, three folks ask me about it, and I been havin' to lie my fool head off. Charley. Charley! You don't think I'd be blabbin' about it over at the boarding house... and having it getting all over town, do ya? No, I reckon not. Well, she gets in this morning, eh? Yeah. Yeah, on the train. Hey, she sent me this here picture. It's one of them new fancy things called a tintype. Oh! It's kinda dark, but you can make it out. She's beautiful, Charley. Just beautiful. Such a big hat. Yeah... Oh. Looks even better that way. Yeah. Very nice. You're not gonna get married to a beautiful girl like that... wearing them dirty duds you got on, are ya? Oh, I... I don't know, Mr. Fowler. That money goes out surprisingly fast. Oh, yeah. I still gotta get a haircut and pay the preacher. It took a whole year of savings to buy her train fare out here. You reckon she'd mind? Well, I don't know, Charley. She's probably used to them Boston-type fellas. Say! Just happen to have a real, genuine Boston-type suit I been saving out of stock. Mr. Fowler, I... And don't worry about money. Who said anything about money? Pay me, don't pay me. Next week'll be soon enough. It looks a little different out here, don't it? Very snappy. Ain't it wonderful? Very snappy, Charley. They'll see you comin'. I guarantee ya! Oh, here he comes now. Sit back. Howdy, Mr. Staunch. Boys. Oh. Whatever it is, it talks. Oh, Mr. Staunch, it's me, Charley Bicker. You know that. Well, by gum, so it is! What do you think of that? It's Charley Bicker, the blacksmith, all duded up. Yeah, but, uh, for what? Well, I don't know. I'll ask him. What are you duded up for, Charley? Don't you pay them any mind, Charley. They just ain't never seen a gentleman before. How are you, Mr. Hanson? Sure is a nice day for it, Charley. Nice day for what? For a haircut. That's what you're gettin' today, ain't it? It looks like you got several fellers waitin'. I'll come back later. No, sir, Charley. You're next. Yes, sir. Just a minute now. Eddie, you get outta here. You look as good as you ever will, if that. Let Mr. Bicker sit down. Excuse me, Mr. Bicker. You sit right there, Mr. Bicker. I been itchin' to get my hands on you for a long time. I ain't in no hurry. Uh, train gets in at, uh, 7:15, Charley. So what? Don't you care? Well, I don't care. Ain't you even goin' down to meet it? Well, I... might do that, just for want of somethin' better to do. Y-You make him real pretty, just in case there might be someone on that train who might be interested in him. I don't know what everybody keeps talkin' about that train for. There ain't nothin' special about that train. ♪ La-la, la-la ♪ La-la-la-la, la-Di-da, la-la ♪ ♪ La Hey, hey, he's gettin' mad. Don't get him mad in my place. Charley, take it easy now. No call to get excited. Not in his place. Come on. Come on. Let's go. See ya later. We'll get outta here. Doggone it. Everybody's been pickin' on me all morning. I'm gettin' about half fed up with it. Sure, sure, Charley. But you gotta remember, you are a very well-liked man, and we ain't had a wedding in town for over a year now. Mr. Hanson, I don't wanna hear nothin' else about no weddings neither. H-How you been, Charley? Fine. You? Fine. That's fine. I'm glad to hear it. There you are, Charley. Hey. I think I got some change. On the house, Charley. This is a nice day for all your friends, and we wish you well. Well, I'm beholden to you, Mr. Hanson. My pleasure. Hey. Oh, give it here. It'll be just... just fine. You try that. Huh? All right, huh? You clean up good, Charley. Aw, I don't care nothin' about that. Everybody likes to look nice. Now out you go. And listen, Charley, everybody in this town is a friend of yours, and they're anxious for you to know it. So you just go along with 'em, you hear me? I don't understand. What you talkin' about? Well, you just walk out that door and you'll see. Go on. Oh, golly! Everybody's been waiting for this day the same as you! You didn't think we'd let you get hitched and not take no notice! Everybody for miles is here to help welcome your bride. We made all the arrangements... the wedding first, and then a dance after. And a shivaree after that! Hey, Mr. Bicker. Yes, sir? Can I smell your new haircut? Why, sure, you can. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Here she comes! Now let's go! Well, sir, this is quite a welcome! More than I had hoped for. Yeah, well, it isn't for you. I stand firm on principles... Well, that's fine. Just move 'em to one side. I-I'm not... I know. Just... Fine. Fine. Governor, an honor. Yes. Oh! I want one of those! Go ahead. Go ahead. Kiss her. Kiss her. How dare you molest my wife, sir! Your wife? Did I hurt you? I thought you were Miss Ellen Carroll from Boston. You ain't? This is my wife, Mrs. Martha Kid. For two pins, I'd show you some manners! I'm terribly sorry, sir. And you, ma'am, I mistook you for another lady. I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you. I'm sorry if I hurt you. I can't see, Mama. Is... Is Mr. Bickers's girl pretty? Oh, hush now. She ain't there yet. One of your passengers gettin' off here, she ain't showed up. All the passengers are off that are gettin' off. Well, is there another young lady on board? That's all there are, except two Mexicans on their way to Cavallero. Forward! This here's a picture of her. Sorta dark, but you can make it out. I-I been expecting her on this train. Ain't seen her. Her name's Ellen Carroll, from Boston. Nope. I been expecting her. On this train! Nope. I thank you. Forward! Well, I... I really pulled a good one on ya, didn't I? Huh, Tom? Yeah. Yeah, I almost busted out laughin' there a couple times, but I knowed if I did that you'd all catch on and... I didn't laugh once. Not once. Did I? No, n-no, no, Charley. You didn't. You... Really a good joke I pulled on you. I had all you believin' some gal was gonna come all the way from Boston just to marry me. You believed as much, didn't you? You told us different all the time, Charley. Yeah. How come you ain't laughin'? I figured when you found out it was all just... just a joke, you'd all laugh. You oughta laugh. No sense hanging around here. I mean, Charley put over his joke all right, so... Look, uh, why don't you... Why don't you go home or... somethin'. Ain't there gonna be a wedding? You said there'd be a wedding, Ma! You get along now. Um, let's go up the street. I'll, um... I'll buy you a drink. Aw... Mr. Staunch, you know I don't drink... except on... on occasions. Well, this is kind of an occasion. A dry occasion. It, uh... No, thanks. Reckon I'll just... hang around the depot here. There's a lot of excitement around a depot. Big doings. Well, maybe she didn't get on the train. Maybe she missed it. Uh, maybe she got off at the wrong station, uh... Mr. Staunch. You don't understand, Mr. Staunch. I mean, I told you it was a joke, and that's what it was... a joke. I mean... what kind of a dumb jaybird would send off a year's savings... to a gal in Boston that he didn't even know to... come all the way out here and marry him? Why, there ain't nobody that dumb. I reckon that... that sorta proves it was a joke, don't it? Yeah, yeah, it... proves it's a joke. If you don't mind, I, uh... I, uh... I don't feel much like... Like laughing. Hold it right there. One false move, and you're a goner. That's better. Let this be lesson to ya. Hey, Charley. Charley. Wait. Wait. We was just inside there talking about you. Come on in. I'll buy you a drink. Better yet, you buy me a drink and I'll tell you all the trouble I've had with women. Oh, Charley. That's gonna hurt. Leave me alone. You hear? I ain't gonna have people laughin' at me. I ain't laughin' at you, Charley. Just leave me alone. I don't hardly never make no mistakes, but when I done 'em, I can see 'em. I hurt his feelings, didn't I? Excuse me, ma'am. Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for the hotel. Right here? I thought as much. Thank you, ma'am. It's you again, you pesky varmint. You better quit followin' me, if you know what's good for you. I eat Injuns for breakfast. One of these days... One of these days... I'm gonna cut me a wooden stick as big as Charley Bickers' arm... and I'm gonna whop you over the head with it! If I never have a stupid horse like you again, it'll be too soon. The least you could do is quit draggin' your feet! Hi, Charley. Howdy, Rusty. Long time no see, Charley. Yep. You hammer-headed... sack-bellied old fleabag. One of these days... Hey, Charley, this wood-eatin' ol' stump-chewer's done throwed a shoe. Well, I reckon you'd better give her new ones all around, 'cause if you don't, she's gonna act like she's walkin' uphill all the time. I hate to ask you on Saturday, Charley, but everybody knows you don't care whether it's Saturday or not. But me, I gotta catch up on my... drinkin'. I'd like to oblige you, Rusty, but... I'm packing to leave. Packin' to leave? You leavin' town? Yep. What for? Y-Y-You kill somebody or somethin'? You in trouble? 'Cause, Charley, if you in trouble, I got a place you can hole up. Ain't nobody gonna find you for a dog's age. It ain't that. I'm just leavin'. That's all. But there ain't another blacksmith around for a hundred miles. Nigh on to 200 for a real good 'un. I can't help that. But, Charley, the whole town's gonna be walkin' inside of a month. It ain't that easy to get a new blacksmith. You know somethin'? I'm surprised the whole town ain't fussin' about it. Don't reckon they know anything about it. They don't know about it? Do you mind if I mention it around? Won't make no difference nohow. Come on, Lightnin'. We got some news. Come on, Lightnin'. We got some news to tell around town. Yes, sir. Charley Bickers is gonna leave town. We got to get over there. Let's go, horse. Go, Lightnin'. Come on. Come on, Lightnin'! We gotta go break the news! Come on! Let's go! Oh, dadgum, horse! Let's go! Dadgum it. You come on, horse. Come on, Lightnin'! Come on! We gotta go break the news! Come on, Lightnin'! Come on! Let's go! Hey, Pa! Ma says for you to get home, or she's gonna come down here and get ya! Hey! Sonny, you'd better keep away from them swingin' doors. You'll get a black eye from somebody going out. Don't you worry. I'll see that your pa gets home all right. Here. Go on. Get home. Rusty Mapin's on his way over here, draggin' that horse you sold him. Don't hurry, Sherm. The way it's goin', he won't arrive for another 10 minutes. Didn't you tell ol' Rusty that horse was made for carryin', not ridin'? No more for you. Get on home. I don't like people's kids havin' to come after 'em. Hiya, Sadie! Hey, Sadie! Come on over here, breathe down my neck... and tell me what a nice fella I am. You tell yourself, and I'll just nod a lot. Take your hands off of her. Supposin' I don't? Now, you know that Sadie is my girl. Oh? When you're in town, maybe. I'm in town. Haven't you noticed? How about asking me whose girl I am? I'd tell you both a thing or two. Just 'cause I sing and dance for you clodhoppers doesn't mean you own me. Hey, Roger, one of these days you and me is gonna have to take a run at each other. Anytime. Now, maybe? No, I'd, uh, rather surprise you. The only way you'd ever surprise me is if you came at me head on. That would surprise me considerable. Wait a minute. Oh, you'd better let him hold you. He's doing you a favor. Eddie! Good. Go tell 'em. Go tell 'em what's gon' happen. Dry! Dry! Dry! I hear you been doing a lot of walking lately, Rusty. Don't shoot him, Sherm. I wanna talk to you. But first, I've got some news for you smart Alecks. Guess who's leavin' town. Who? You don't know, do ya? No. Charley Bicker. Charley who? Charley Bicker, that's who! All packed up and ready to move. He's the best blacksmith we got. Not only the best. He's the only blacksmith we got. That makes him the best, don't it? Yeah, I guess it does. When did you see him? Just now. Well, not exactly just now. I been draggin' that horse for 30 minutes. Never mind the fool horse! I'll buy him back! What about Charley Bicker? He's got three wagons I need done by Monday. If he leaves town, I'm out of the haulin' business right then. If you don't have your wagons by Monday, how am I gonna get my liquor in here? You ain't! And Fowler's store. And the eatery. I can't supply anybody without them wagons being fixed. Wh-What about us riders? Who's gonna make our horseshoes? We'll all be walkin' inside of a week. Especially me. Where you goin', Mr. Bicker? Yeah, Mr. Bicker. Where are you goin'? I'm clearin' out, boys. Here he is. Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Say, I heard you had some notion about leaving town. Yes, sir. I'm leaving. Don't go, Mr. Bicker. Aside from all your friends hatin' to see you go, you leave this town in a terrible way without a blacksmith. I'm sorry about that, Mr. Staunch, but I can't help it. My mind's set on it. I'm the laughingstock of this town, and you know it. No, no, that's not true. I know better, and you do too. Can't say that I blame you much. I reckon I'd laugh at myself if it wasn't me. But... it is me, and I'm leavin'. As long as you got no hard feelings, why don't you just put it off for a couple days? No, sir. My mind's set on it. All right, then step down... and have some good-bye drinks with your friends here. Yeah. Aw. Boys, you know I ain't much on drinkin'. You fixin' to refuse a man who wants to say "good-bye" with style? Well, I... I reckon I couldn't do that. We'll tie up your horse for ya, Charley. Yeah, take it... Here we go. Now get him up here. You kids get away from here! Go on! Beat it! Go home to your ma! She wants you! Go ahead, Eddie. Get it back in there. Hey, Eddie. Come here. Hey, he's taking this anvil, the only anvil we got in town. You reckon we oughta steal it? Yeah. Wait a minute. I'll help you. On the count of three. One, two, three, lift. Wait a minute. You know, it ain't right to steal a man's anvil. Na... Let's steal his trunk. What you hittin'... Well, here's to you, Charley. Good-bye and good luck. Thank you. Wait a minute. I-I'll drink to that too. Sherman, you want to farewell toast? Charley, you and me been friends a long time. I'm gonna miss you. Same to you, Mr. Bester. Let's drink to that. I-I'll drink to that. Charley, don't forget to write. I'll drink to that. Charley, here's, uh... O-One for the road, Charley. I-I'll drink to that. Charley, you're a very lovable man. Oh, thank you, Mr. Hanson. I'll... I'll drink to that. Yeah! Here's another one for the road, Charley. There we go, Charley! Charley... Yes. I'll drink... I'll drink to that. Here's... to the road... that's at the end of the road... I'll drink to that. Uh, don't go, Doc. We, uh, might need first aid. I already need it, and I'm the only doctor I got. The place is thinning out. Not many left to keep it going. I don't know what's holding him up. He's got a hollow leg, I swear. Give him a farewell drink, on the house. But I've already given him 50. Again! Again! But I'm nearly out of whiskey. Where you going, Eddie? We need your help. Oh, Jonathan, I've already said good-bye to him 14 times. Just one more drink. I'm beginning to wish he would leave. This time, make it beer. One for the road, huh, Charley? Well, all the good times we've had together, huh? Good-bye, Charley. Good-bye, Charley. Indian whiskey. It's all I got left. Yeah, well, uh... Good stuff, huh, Charley? Good-bye, Charley. So long, Charley. Good-bye, Charley. Good-bye, Charley. Charley has left us. Come on. Good-bye, Charley. Give me a hand. Crazy Foot, give us a hand. Eddie, get a door or something to carry him on. He may never walk again. Come on... Good-bye, Charley. Hanson! Come here! Fellas! Here! Give us a hand! Wait a minute. Here we go. Here we go. All right. One... two... three. Hurry up with that door! There you are. There you go. All right. Easy does it. Easy does it. Oh! There you go. Don't hurt his head. No, no. Let it down. There we go. Now, don't you be long in there. We'll be late for church. Glad you're here, Doc. He's showing signs of life. That surprises me. We've gotta keep him here, you know, one way or another. Well, hereafter leave me out of your farewell parties. We can't keep Charley liquored up forever. Ruin his health in the long run. I only got this much left. And besides, I can't afford it. Also, he ain't gettin' any work done. Sherman? Are you in there again? No, my dear. I merely give that impression. You come out of there right now, Sherman. It's time for church. Yes, my dear. Coming. If you had any consideration for me, you'd at least stay out of there on Sundays. Consideration? My dear, when I think what you've meant to me all these years, it's all I can do to keep from telling you. If that's not consideration, I don't know what is. Let's go to church! He'll live, all right. Not so sure about myself. I'd better be getting to church. I need it more than most. Hope Mrs. Yancy's baby doesn't arrive today. Say, mister, can you tell me where I can find the sheriff? I'm talkin' to you, partner. The sheriff's office is just down the street. Y-You can't miss it. He's a nice man. You'll like him.Thanks... buddy. If you'll wait just a second, I'll go down there with you. I'm on my way there myself. N-N-N-No, thanks, mister. Here's to, uh... To Charley. Don't he look natural? Just like he was asleep. He is. The only way to keep him in town is find him a woman. There ain't many of those, unless you count Indian women. Me count 'em. I can't even find a woman for myself, let alone somebody else. After all, how many women in town is there that ain't already married? My sister ain't married. Oh, Tom, your... Your sister's so bucktoothed she can eat squash through a picket fence. Yeah? What do you know? She don't even like squash. Never did. I could do better work... if he'd stop twitching like that. Well, drink up, boys. It's the last of the whiskey. One way or another, this is gettin' to be the nicest town in the whole state. Squeeze the bottle a little. Tom, you want a chaser? Huh? No, no, no. I had some water yesterday. The last drink in town. Never thought I'd see the day. Well, you're gonna see worse if Bester don't get his wagons movin'. I hope nobody gets bit by a snake. Wh-What about Sadie? Not at a time like this. For the girl, I mean. Nothing wrong with Sadie. There ain't anybody within 50 miles around here... would say anything bad about Sadie. Me neither. Course, I never saw her in the daylight. Hey, I got an idea. Of course, he... He might recognize her. Oh, I don't think so. He never went near her as far as I know. Wait. I got an idea. Don't anybody want to hear about my idea? Well, anyhow, fix her hair on top of her head like in that picture he's carryin', ain't nobody gonna recognize her. Least of all Charley. He ain't never looked straight at a gal his whole life. I foresee certain difficulties with the ladies of the town. You wanna keep your store open, don't you? Wait. Never mind about all that. Listen. Don't you want to hear my idea? Look. Let's get Sadie to be Charley's girl. That's what we'll do, Tom. That's what we'll do. Hold it. Hold it. Now, let me do all the talking. Let him do all the talking. Shh. Come in! What do you mean, waking a girl up in the middle of the day? And a Sunday too! Well, uh, we kinda want to talk to you. What about? Well, it's sort of a delicate matter, you might say. Have you ever thought of getting married, Sadie? Now, don't get mad... just because some loose-mouthed plow jockey can't keep his mouth shut. No, it's like this. Do you know Charley Bicker? Never heard of him. The blacksmith, Sadie. Great big, tall galoot. Course, maybe you wouldn't recognize him at first, the way he always keeps his head down when he's talking to womenfolk. Don't know him. Well, uh, he don't know you either, close-up, and we're kinda counting on that. What's it got to do with me? Well, you see, Charley is kind of old-fashioned about this and that, and he's of an age where's he's just achin' and burnin' to get married, and, well, this girl was supposed to come in on the train yesterday. That was the parade I saw... all that foofaraw down the street. Yeah, well, he's been writing to her and she's been writing back, and he's all fired up to meet her and get hitched, but she didn't show up. So we sort of set ourselves up as a committee to find someone to... take her place. Sadie, listen. It was my idea. We figured a girl that like you wouldn't mind gettin' hitched, so we picked you. We'll fix it for you to meet Charley, you'll turn yourself loose on him, and before you know it he'll be a goner. What do you mean, a girl like me? Ow! Whew! I guess she don't wanna get married. I'd shoot you down dead if you weren't such a curiosity. Well, he ain't such a curiosity we have to save him! Just tell me what I said that was so wrong! Take him away while I'm still feeling sorry for him! I'll... I'll talk to her. Got some in my eye. Stuff's hard to get off. Looks good on you. Whoo! Man, she hit me right in the chest with that perfume bottle. You smell like a shot-up barbershop. Gave me a loose tooth, feels like. Ah. Stranger in town? I just got in. I'm, uh... looking for a place to... settle down. Welcome. What'll it be, stranger? Whiskey. A big one. No whiskey. How 'bout a sarsaparilla? No, thanks. Nothin', thanks. N-Nothing at all. I gotta be, uh, movin' along now. You haven't been here very long. Long enough. What's the name of this town? I wouldn't want to forget it. Calico. That makes a lot of sense. Then it's settled. You'll never regret it, Sadie. I... I promise you, you'll never regret it. I regret it already. The whole thing sounds crazy. Well, you don't have to do nothin'. All you gotta do is act like... You sure this jayhawk won't catch on? Just get him feeling better. That's all. Then in a couple days you can say that you changed your mind about getting married... or that you don't like it here. Then we'll get you out of town, bring you back, and he'll never know the difference. I hope you know what you're doing. So do I. Oh, so do I. I need clothes. Well, we wouldn't expect you to come into town with... Different clothes. Different from this stuff. A "good girl" outfit. Would Fowler's store have what you want? He should. I'll have him open up for you. Now, about people talking... Some of the men... Nobody'll talk. You take my word for it. It's all set. It's gonna be easy. Just keep telling me that. Loud and often. Well, I'd better start the ball rolling. Mind if I ask you something? I didn't think you'd do it. Neither did I at first. Well, why are ya? You ain't gettin' nothin' out of it. No? When I first came here, I thought things'd be different in this town. I thought I'd really have a chance. First time I went walking down the street, all the women I met pulled their dresses aside... so they wouldn't touch me, just 'cause I sing and dance for a living. I won't mind putting one over on them. Hang on, Charley! Hey! Leave him there! Hey! Let go of him! Let go of him! What's going on here? I'm leaving. Charley! Th-They found your girl! They found your girl! They found her? That's right! She got off at Central City by mistake. She's coming by stage! I got the telegraph right here! Whoo-hoo! She's coming! She's coming! My gal's coming! Whoo! All right, you. Open the store. She's gonna need some clothes. Who? Sadie! Sadie! Who else? And you, get the buckboard... My buckboard. Go get her at the Crossforks and bring her here, bag and baggage. I'm on my way! And you, calm him down. Clean him up and have him back here in time to get the stage. We gotta get you cleaned up, Charley. Bring him into my place! Charley! Wait! I can't breathe! Yeah! Wait. Charley. Charley, wait! There. That's better than you've ever looked before. Oh, Mr. Staunch. How do I look? I feel terrible. Well, you look fine. Fine. I feel terrible. Don't let him faint in here. I got termites. Get him on the bench here. That's it. It's just the excitement, I reckon. And plain ol' worry. I mean, what do you say to her? Well, you just start with "hello" and keep talking. Fan him a lot. I've got arrangements to make. Mr. Hanson, how do you go about getting engaged, or proposing? I ain't never been engaged before. Do like I do. How's that? You back 'em against something solid... and then start kissin' 'em enough to cover a barn. If they don't knock you down by that time, then you'll know you're engaged. Will that work? I don't know. I always got knocked down. Listen. Charley, listen to me. Now, you have to sneak up on them. You get ahold of their hand, one way or another. You talk about roses and such. Roses and such. Roses and suchlike, and then, before you know it, the damage is done. You be her a second, and you sneak up on him, kinda. Go ahead, practice. Roses and such. Way to do. Practice. Whatcha doin', mister? I'm teaching my finger to read. That's, uh... That's some hand you got on you there. Yes, sir, that's about the best hand I ever did see, that hand. Don't grab it. Sneak up on it. I'll bet you say that to everybody you sneak up on. No, I don't. Just you. You're the only one. Like I was sayin', anyhow, that, uh... That hand's like a rose. Yeah. Just... like a rose. Nice and soft... No grabbing. You sneak up on it, huh? Why is it you wanna grab, grab, grab all the time? How am I gonna sneak up on it if you keep hidin' your... Leave it hangin' out where I can grab it. If I leave it hanging out, then you're gonna grab it. You start grabbing, grabbing at everything if I leave it hanging out. You'd get me scared to death with the grabbing. I didn't mean to scare you, now. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Like I was sayin', you was getting to me... and makin' me real soft with that rose talk. I like the rose talk. Yeah, I could tell that. All right, well, anyhow, like I said, you, uh... you got a hand just like a rose. It's nice and soft, just like a rose... and I got it. Oh! I'm lookin' for the sheriff. Oh, uh, he ain't here. That's good. Hey! Hey, she's comin'! She's on her way! She's comin'! Hey, she's coming! Hey! She's coming! Yes, sir! Gimme back my hat! Gimme back my hat. Hey! Is it... Is it true? She's here? Charley's girl? Someone in church said they found her... Charley's girl. Well, she's be in on the stage in a minute. Now look, it ain't exactly what you think. Mr. Staunch, what do you reckon I ought to do? Marry her right off or wait a spell or what? You better wait for a couple of days. Oh, why wait? Do it right now and get it over with, Charley. Sherm, could I talk to you for just a minute? Later. I don't want to miss this. This is a big, big day, Charley's girl coming to town. Let's get him over to the hotel. It's bigger than you think. Be a day you'll long remember. The stagecoach is coming! Charley, she's coming. Hah! Giddap. Hah! Uh, come on, Charley. There. Oh! Well, uh, welcome to Calico City, ma'am. Why, thank you, everybody. Thank you, Mr... Uh, Staunch. Jonathan Staunch. I'm sort of the mayor and sheriff, you might say. You're gonna meet all these nice people here, but right now you're gonna get acquainted up with Charley Bicker here, who you probably know by name already. Dear Charles... Dear... Dear. Charles. Well, go on, say something. Speak to her. Don't you know me? Am I different than you expected? Oh, no, ma'am. You're it, all right. You look just like your picture. Oh, I... I hope I look better than that. Oh, uh... In fact, I know I do. Are you glad to see me? Oh... I think that means you like me. Yes, I think so too. Now... All right, stand back. Stand back, everybody. Give them room to get acquainted. That's it. Stand back. Stand back. Come on. Everybody back. See her? If you didn't know who it is, you wouldn't know who it was. Just what on earth do you mean by that mysterious remark? First we have to find you a place to stay. Hey, you can stay at my place. I got a nice little place. You'd just love it. We can go there right now. Just a second. There are a few formalities. You mean like courtin' and proposing and all that. I sort of figured we could do all that at one time. I got the impression, from your letters, of course, that you were a little shy. No, the best idea is for you to visit each other. You know, talk and get to know one another. Oh. Well, my way, we'd... We'd get to know one another, all right. Maybe you ought to stay in the hotel. Nonsense, Jonathan. You know the kind of flotsam and jetsam... that hangs around the hotel, whoopin' and hollering it up and down the halls. You're one of them yourself. No, she'll stay with us, and pleased to have her. This is Mrs. Bester. Oh, I'm very grateful for your kindness. Not at all. Sherman, this nice young woman will stay with us. Great Scott. I mean, day. Great day. Isn't that something? Jonathan. Uh, yes. Yes. What is it, Sherman? What is it? Tell me. Uh, Jonathan... Uh, Jonathan, I think Miss, uh, uh, Ellen... might find us dull and set in our ways. I think she might prefer livelier company. Oh, I have a way of livening things up wherever I go, Mr. Bester. You won't be bored with me around, I promise. Well, now that that's settled... And I'm much obliged... That is, if I can come around visiting... and courting full steam like I plan to do. I'll get your stuff and we can be on our way. Charley. If it pleases you, we'll have a sociable in your honor... so you can meet the ladies of the town. Oh. I'm looking forward to that... Meeting all the nice ladies. I'm going to enjoy every minute of it. Every minute of it. We have a surrey over here. I think you'll... You will work on my wagons the first chance you get, won't you, Charley? I sort of cling to that idea, in the middle of everything else. Don't you worry, Mr. Bester. He's got plenty to worry about. Well, since my gal got here, I promise you, your wagon'll be fixed by tomorrow afternoon. If not before. Mighty warm day. Mighty warm. Not for us bachelors. And your wife is giving her a sociable. Every nice lady in town will be there. She'll enjoy every minute of it. Ah, Staunch! Look kind of puny, Sherm. I ain't gonna live through this, and I'm not sure I want to. You know what Mrs. Bester told her at lunch? She said she reminded her of somebody. Everybody reminds people of somebody. Yes, but everybody isn't the somebody this somebody is. What are you sniggering at, Jonathan Staunch? You've been laughing the whole afternoon. Well, I'm feeling kind of good, Emma, delighted the way you ladies are fussing over Charley's girl. Oh, it's a pleasure having her here. Isn't it, Sherman? Oh, it's an experience, I tell you. You children having a good time? Charles wants to show me the barn. It's a real nice barn. I think she'd enjoy seeing it. Folks are all leaving now anyhow. People in love ought to be alone. You run along. It's kind of sweet to watch them, isn't it? Yeah. Sure is. Something about that girl, though, reminds me of somebody. Water. Have some of your punch. It's mostly water. Little early in the year now, but later on, barns like this... will just be filled with swallows. They flit and fly around through them rafters like you can't believe it, in a way that'd almost make you dizzy. I don't know how they do it. I mean, flying among all them rafters like that without ever hittin' nothin'. You got a hand just like a rose. No, it isn't. It's just a hand. See? Yeah. It's about the... softest thing I ever did touch... Except maybe a rabbit. Me, my old hands are more like meat hooks, I reckon. Guess that's from the anvil. You're a blacksmith? Yeah. I wrote you about it. Of course. Um... I meant, have you always been a blacksmith? Yeah, and a pretty good 'un, I think. But, well, I know it ain't the best thing in the world a man can be. You don't have to say that. Well, yeah, since we're getting married and all, I think we ought to face facts, and the fact of the matter is that... Well, the fact of the matter is, ma'am, I ain't much. But I'm about all I could scrape together. That's more than enough for anybody, Charles. "Charles." Hey... Ain't nobody ever called me nothin' but Charley around here... till you came along. I sure do like the way you say Charles. Sounds so dignified and elegant and refined. Just like I just took a bath. You know? You're very lonely, aren't you? Not anymore, I ain't. Listen... I think we better be getting back to the house. I sure have a hankerin' to kiss you, ma'am. I can't keep it from welling up inside me, but... it'll just have to wait a spell. You go first. It ain't considered polite for a man to go first. Why not? Well, I... Well... I'll explain it to you after we're married. I might fall. You go first. All right. Now, tomorrow... That is, if you want to... Tomorrow I thought I'd take you out... and show you our house that I fixed up for you. Our house. Oh, that sounds nice. That sounds very... nice. You'll see. Tomorrow. Come on. As usual, my dear, your social functions... leave much to be desired. Everybody was bored stiff. I was bored stiffer. Emma? Oh, excuse me. I thought I heard cryin'. Oh, really? I must have been... I wonder who... It was me. I was crying. Hmm! You should have seen me before I married Mr. B. And I had reason. You want to talk about it? Or is it none of my business? You've been very nice to me. Everybody has. Oh, it'd be easier for me if you weren't. I'm more used to that. I could have kept on with it. But as it is, I have to tell you the truth. No, you don't. Although I was wondering when you would. And I knew you would. I had told the ladies you would too. You know about me? All of you? You know who I really am? Right from the first. But you didn't say a word. Why should we? You a single woman is one thing, but you nice and married off is something else again, and hooray for that. Then you don't mind? "'Tis better to marry than to burn." And you not being around anymore... for our husbands to go starin' at on Saturday nights, pleasures us considerable. You always made us feel a little dowdy on Sundays. This way, you can fret right along with the rest of us. That is, if you like Charley, and I think you do. That's why I was crying. I figured as much. I didn't count on that... Liking him so much. It surprises me. Charley Bicker is a surprising man. You going to tell him? I don't know how, but I am. You don't have to tell Charley, you know. Yes, I do. Like him that much, do you? That case, I hope you change your mind about telling him. Rusty. Stable my horse, will you? Yeah. Looks like he needs a rubdown too. How much you charge for that? Same as usual. Nothin'. Just don't like to see a dusty horse. Nor a rider using them Spanish spurs. You ride your way and I'll ride mine. Are you staring at me? Well, I reckon I am. We heard you was gonna be out of town for a while. I'm back. Well, I can see that. You think I'm blind or something? Hey! Hey, where you goin'? That wagon's nearly ready for Mr. Bester. You're gonna deliver it, ain't you? I'll tell him. Okay, it's your play. But what is it? Let me put it this way. We think this town would be better off without you. You runnin' me out? Looks that way, don't it? This measly town ain't nothin' to me. Then you won't mind leaving. Depends. I came her to see Sadie. I'll see her and then check out. Oh, no, you won't. She ain't even here. Anybody tell him about Sadie yet? Tell me what? It's time to leave, that's what. Somebody better tell me what's going on. I guess we'd better. You mean to say that he don't know? Not a thing. Well, somebody gonna tell him. Maybe me when I go get my horse. If I were you, I'd think twice about that. Three times, Roger. Why should I care what he knows or doesn't know? That was a wise decision. Here he comes! Here he comes. Hi, fellas. Hi, Charley. Ah. Mr. Bester. They told me I might find you in here. Your wagon's finished. It's over there in front of your place. Thanks, Charley. Run along now. Let's go, Charley. Wait a minute. I hear you're getting married, Charley. Yeah. Saturday. That is, if I can talk her into it. Why don't we have a drink on that, huh? Charley don't drink. You ought to know that. Why don't you let Charley say what he'll do. Well, I... I reckon I will. A soft drink sounds pretty good, as a matter of fact. A sarsaparilla's all I got anyhow. You're kind of a clumsy ox, ain't you, Charley? Yeah, I... I reckon that was my fault. I'm sorry. Well, you're about as clumsy as they make 'em. You're a real clodhopper. You mad at me about something? It's sure hard to insult you, ain't it, Charley? You're getting there. You talk big, Charley. I notice you ain't, uh, carrying a gun. I ain't never seen no need for one. You have now. You need a gun real bad, Charley. Believe me. I wouldn't even know how to handle it. I wouldn't know what to do with it. Just pick it up, that's all. I'll give you that. Just pick it up, point it at me... and then we'll go from there. Now what do I do? Pull the trigger! Pull the trigger! No, wait, Charley. Wait. Don't do it. What do you want me to do now? Just give me my gun back. You over being mad at me now? I tell you, Charley, I just gotta take a piece of you, one way or t'other. How about you and me having a nice, friendly fight? How would that be? I don't know much about fist fighting either. I was always afraid of hurting somebody. I'll tell you. Mr. Hand, it ain't gonna be much fun, 'cause I'm powerful strong. Oh, it's all right, Charley. I'm pretty fast with my mitts. I'm good at it. Well, if you're fast enough to stay out of my way, I can't see nothin' wrong with it. That is, if you're sure I won't hurt you too much. I don't think so, Charley. As a matter of fact, I can kind of guarantee it. I reckon in that case, it's all right. Not in here. No fights in here. Yeah, you go on outside, and he'll meet you out there. Go on, Charley. Go on. Charley, come on out. I'll help you. Look. No gun. Leave your belt on the table. I've seen Roger here fight. He's liable to cut Charley to pieces. You bet I will. Charley's mighty strong. Yeah, but he doesn't know a thing about it, and Roger's one of the best thumpers I ever seen. That I am. Don't worry, boys. I'm only gonna mark him up a little bit for the wedding. Sorry about that, Roger. Hey, Lefty. Fight! Lefty, it's a fight. Hey! It's a fight, Lefty! Hold that. Kids, get out of here. Go on. Get outta here. Oh, I'm sorry. Stand back. You know, he... He can't be too healthy. Roger Hand, it is my painful duty as mayor of this town... to arrest you for disturbin' the peace, blockin' the traffic and lying around in the street, doing nothing. All right, boys, take him away. Take him away. Ladies. Charley Bicker, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I am, Mrs. Bester, but it wasn't none of my doing, I'll guarantee you. That Roger Hand just wouldn't hear of nothin' else. What was the fight about? He didn't say. I'm sure sorry you got here in time to see it though. I was just on my way over to take you for a buggy ride. I... sort of had a question I wanted to ask you. Finally got up steam, have you? Oh. You're fixin' to say yes, aren't you? I haven't been asked yet. Act surprised when it happens. Sherman. Come and see something else in Fowler's I got my heart set on. Here you are. Wait a minute. He's coming to, Mayor. Oh, he really... Oh, gee. That must've hurt. Why, you hit his head. I bet that smarts. Those things happen. They happen all the time. I got... I got him in Abilene. You can cross him off. Kittrick's my name. I been waitin' for you. Blaze Kittrick, the bounty hunter? Heard of me, have you? Should make it easier. I'm, uh... I'm lookin' for this fella here. We don't like bounty hunters around here, Kittrick. I don't care what you like or what you don't like. When I'm on the trail of a man, I'm like a bulldog. I never let go. Never forget a face neither. They don't happen to call you Panama, do they? I'm Jonathan Staunch. I'm the sheriff of this here town. Yeah. All right. And I'm also the mayor. Let that be a lesson to ya. I told you I never forget a face, and I don't. Now, if you ever see the fella on this here poster, you let me know. Sheriff! Sheriff Staunch! You're a goner. You, Rusty and Eddie! When I get out of here, I'm not gonna forget this. I'm gonna get you! Well, there it is... Our house. That is, if everything works out all right. I been workin' on it in my spare time. I know it ain't much. Sure ain't like nothin' back in Boston, I know. Don't say anything against it. Please don't. Oh. You know, I been staying down at the stable myself, just so it'd stay nice for you. Oh. It's the nicest house I ever saw. You know, I been thinkin' ever since you got into town... how I was gonna ask you, what I was gonna say. I got a funny feeling, sort of a notion, that... makes a lump come up right there, if I was to ask you right now to set a date for us to get married, you'd just flat turn me down. Just turn me down flat. Supposing I did. Well, I... I wouldn't give two cents for myself. Now try not to move. I'm afraid of breaking you. You... You ain't gonna say no, are you? Please? It isn't easy to answer you. The answer I wanted would have been easy. Oh. Oh, don't do that. I can't marry you, Charles. I can't. Well, expecting you to say that. I been thinking about it all day. I said to myself... I said, "Aw, what's the matter with you anyhow, Charley? She's a wonderful girl. She came all the way from Boston just to marry you. Why would she go turning you down at the end?" But I reckon I knew all along that you would. I said to myself... I said, "Charley, sometimes you can't never have the thing you want most... 'cause you just couldn't stand to be that happy." That's what I said. I ain't never talked to myself before. I don't like it none neither. So you... You see, it... It didn't come as no big surprise. Oh, ma'am, I... Please don't cry. You make me feel just terrible about even asking you. Hey. Maybe... Maybe it ain't me at all. Maybe it's the house or something, huh? Charles, it's a beautiful house. And you too. You're a fine, beautiful man. Aw. And I... I wouldn't change anything. You or the house. Except maybe I'd, uh... I just put this over here. And, uh... I'd-I'd move this rocker... over here by the window. That's, uh, where the sun comes shining in. Th-That's so I could see better when I'm sewing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's... that's all right with me. But it can't be like that. I'm trying to tell you, Charles. All I ever wanted was a good time. I never meant any harm, not to anybody. Men always liked me, and I always like them. More than I should sometimes. I'm trying to tell you... I haven't been good. Oh, that ain't no reason. Why, one time I spent a whole year's earnings... in one place in one week in Abilene. It was a terrible, sinful place, full of sin and remorse, and I had a wonderful time. I never expected you not to have loved nobody, even if you did come from Boston. Oh, why are you so gentle? It'd be easier for me if you weren't. Why don't you get mad? No. I got mad one time, and I purt near killed a fella just for laughing at me, and that wasn't my intention. Reckon a feller that's as big as I am, with a face that ain't no pretty Sunday afternoon, ought to expect to get laughed at every once in a while. I didn't like it none the better anyhow. Only time I ever get mad is when people laugh at me. I don't think anybody should ever laugh at you, Charles. And I can't marry you. I can't. Yeah. Yeah, that's... That's just the way it is, ain't it? I mean, I... I can't fault you none for not feeling the same way I do. That's... That's just the way it is. Yeah. Just the way it is. Well, you, uh... You take the buggy on back into town. I... I think I'll walk. I feel a need for walking. Where's Kittrick? Kittrick, he's over at the Razzle-Dazzle, staring at everybody that comes in. You, uh, told the folks what to say? Just like you said. Here are the keys. Staunch, you can't keep me here forever, and you know what I'm gonna do to you when I get out. I know, I know. You're gonna get me. You're gonna get me. Here. Hold this lamp for me. You ever heard tell of a Blaze Kittrick? Yeah. He's a gunfighter. One that got the Earp boys, ain't he? He's a bounty hunter now. Never forgets a face. He's in town now. Here. Thank you. He's after this fella. Wants him dead or alive. If you ask me, he wants him dead, Panama. Panama? Who you callin' Panama? That's right, Panama. Pana... Hey, Staunch, you know who I am. What are you up to? I'm gonna get you! All right, men, keep your eyes out for this man. Mr. Kittrick here is looking for him. Right, Mr. Kittrick? Yeah, that's him, all right. Panama Jack. I never forget a face. Who are you? Uh, Staunch. Jona... I'm the sheriff, remember? We met this afternoon. Ah. Just testin', that's all. See if you knew.Yeah. Mm-hmm. Buy you a drink, Mr. Kittrick? I don't mind if I do. Worst beer I ever had though. Tastes like sarsaparilla. Hey, Tom, old buddy. How are things goin'? How are you? Oh, just fine. Fine, old buddy. Old buddy. Get... Get back in there. Hup, hup. Sorry... Sorry, Tom. All right. Say, Tom, is Staunch gone yet? Oh, same as usual. Went over to the saloon to wet his whistle. I got stuck, same as usual, sweepin' up with the broom here. Aw. But you're good at that, Tom. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Careful of the boots here, Tom. Well, I try to keep a neat cell. Yeah, you sure do, Tom.Yeah. Well, you know, this is a dry job, so I will go over to the saloon and... Wet my whistle. Hoo! Wet the old whistle, huh? Hmm? Huh? Oh. Oh. Oh. Uh-huh.Uh-huh. Bottoms up. And I'll get you too, you... Here, baby. Here we go. Yeah. Who's that, just went out? Nobody. Well, Mr. Kittrick, here's lookin' at you. Here's mud in your eye. What do you mean by that? Well, your boys found out I could see or not, even if I was after somebody else. No, just a little harmless toast, that's all. Watch it next time. Well, down the hatch. Ooh. Worst beer I ever tasted. Staunch! Where are my guns? Hi, Panama. How about a drink? Long time no see, Panama Jack. Yeah, Panama. What'll it be, Panama? Well, well, well. If it isn't Panama Jack. Who are you callin' Panama Jack? So we meet at last, eh, Panama? Draw, you low-down, lily-livered skunk. I'll give you first move. Go ahead and draw. What's the matter with you? I ain't got nothin' to draw. Are you blind? You shouldn't have said that, Panama. Mercy went clean out of my heart. Draw. Go on, draw! Oh, look, I ain't got nothin'. Look here. Can't you see? Hyah! Giddyap now. Self-defense. You all saw him draw first. You got the wrong man. Panama's getting away! And on your horse too! Well, I need a horse. Somebody give me a horse. You can have mine. You can have mine. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, let's go. Let's hurry. His name is Lightnin', Blaze, and he's something. I don't rightly know what, but he's something. There you go. Steady there, Lightnin' boy. Steady. Follow that horse! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Up, up and away! Hah! Hyah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hiya, Charley. Oh, hi, Charley. Charley! Hi, Charley. On his way over to my house, looks like. Yeah, in a hurry to see his girl. Wouldn't you be? The drinks are on the house, boys. Sarsaparilla? I'm beginning to like sarsaparilla. Hello, suckers. Aw, Sadie. It's over. I'm back where I belong. I'm sorry it didn't work out, Sadie. Not me.

She left here, cryin', over an hour ago. What happened, Charley? Uh, she, uh... She turned me down flat. I reckon that's the whole of it. Did she say why, when she's so stuck on you? Stuck on me?

Thanks entirely to me. Uh, I don't know. What's the matter with you? I been thinkin'.You been what? Yeah, we kept our blacksmith, all right, but we lost the only unmarried woman female we got... within a hundred miles around here. Hey, yeah. What about that? Yeah, well... Fellas, I'll figure something. Have I ever let you down?
