MISS STONE Staring Directed by Zika Mitrovic At the beginning of the 20th century, Macedonia was still under Turkish rule. Many church missions were trying to spread their influence among the subjugated people. In 1901 the seat of the American Protestant Church for Macedonia was in Thessalonika, headed by Dr. House. We've been preparing the journey to the inside regions of Macedonia for a long time. I know you are impatient. I have good news. The Turkish authorities permitted us to organize a religion course in the village Bansko. You can leave right now. - It's wonderful! Katerina, I know that you're looking forward to this. It's not going to be easy for you there and I know I promised to come and help you. But, unfortunately, I'll have to stay here. But, how could we... - I know it won't be easy for you to manage the mission alone. So we decided to send along somebody who will be as useful as I am -Miss Hellen Stone! Katerina, let's introduce her to our guide! -I almost forgot... The next day, Miss Stone started across the Pirin Mountain, on her way to the inside regions of Macedonia. She was supposed to teach and preach her religion. Although she's never been in this country before and knew nothing about it, she believed in herself and in her task. After crossing the mountain, we'll have one day rest in Razlog. Ivan, wait! Hold it! Are you sure we'll cross the mountain before dark? Don't worry! I know these parts. Good day to you, commander. - Who are these people? An American church mission. They have a traveling permit. Let me see it! All right! You may proceed. But I don't recommend traveling by night. There are bandits in these mountains. Let's go! Let me see what this Doctor House looks like! I expected an older man. - They have no military escort. It means that we can do our job in silence. Doctor House! You are coming with us! Who? Me? 'Yes, you! I am not Doctor House. He remained in Thessalonika. That's right. I didn't have time to inform you. Then, who is the leader of this group? -Miss Stone. The one in the middle. She's going instead of Dr. House. There goes our plan! Women are out of the question! -Why? If she is House's replacement she can be as valuable. Miss Stone, you are coming with us! Take her mule! You mustn't! I will not let you! Take it easy! Get up! This is kidnapping! If you take her, you'll answer for it! What do you need Miss Stone for? -Your friend won't be hurt. Then, take me, too! - What are you talking about? We only need her. - I'm not leaving her! Katerina, calm down! Don't you see they only want her? She is my wife. She is Macedonian... You will come, too! All the three of you! -What? We'll need someone to take the letter to Thessalonika. Let the commander decide! You go ahead to the camp. Mandana! Dismount! Thank you! Get inside! Where is the commander? - Up there. What? It's not an open show! Beat it! Now! -But, why... We had no choice, Jane. - I see... But, hauling women all over the mountains seems uncouth. Hallo! -Have you heard what we did? Instead of Doctor House you kidnapped Miss Stone! And another woman with her! - She was Krste's idea. He seemed to like her. - It's a crude joke! I was against kidnapping women from the start! It seems to me that we didn't make a mistake, though. Only, we have to be quick. - What did I tell you? We have to complete our plan. Explain to the American lady that her stay in the mountains depends on herself. If she agrees she'll be free in two weeks. And, release the couple! They will take the letter to the mission in Thessalonika. We have to leave as soon as tonight. The Turks will find out what happened and they'll send a posse. -I left two patrols down the road. They'll warn us if they see anything. Take this to Doctor House in Thessalonika. Tell him we want 25.000 Liras for Miss Stone. In a week's time one of our men will contact you, and you'll tell him Doctor House's answer. How will this man find us? - He will, don't worry! You're going with your husband. - I am staying with Miss Stone! Don't be silly, Katerina! Please, let me stay! -Your sacrifice is senseless. Get ready to leave! Good morning! Good morning... Good morning... Here! What do you say? Hold the rifle firmly... That's it! And now, can you aim? -Yes... She asks where are we. - In an eagle's nest. She asks if you are Christian. - Who, me? -Yes, you! I am on bad terms both with God and with Mohammad. What is your name? -I have no name. -You're nameless? My nickname is indecent... Not for the ears of such ladies. Mandana. This lady is American and she would like to talk to you. From America, eh? My brother works there on the railway. The other one is here, working hard as a farmer. What? She sounds as if she's blaming me for something. She says, your brothers are working while you're roaming the mountains with a gun in your hand. Do you think I left my wife and my five children because I enjoy strolling the mountains? You know nothing about us! My brother writes that in America they've heard only of the Turks. They know nothing about the other people, the Christians, people like us, who live in hell. She wants to know where are we and how long shall we stay here. If you want to wash, you'll find the fountain in the courtyard. We asked something else! - And I answered something else! Good morning! Did he meet my husband? -No. He is also in Constantinople. I'll ask the commander to release you. -I won't leave her! Are you afraid something might happen to her? No, but she's in a foreign country. It'll be difficult for her. I'll take you to a village. It will be easier for you among women. Is Jane there? -Yes. Still reconciling the peasants. We should settle this matter in front of the commander... We couldn't expect anything from the Turkish judges. That's why we came to you. Tell us who is right or I'll sue him until the day he dies! What is the price of that parcel of land? -5 Liras. And, how much have you spent on legal taxes? -30 Liras. Do you hear that? They're laughing at you. But, what else could we do? It's about the land... -That's right! Only, you are wrong if you think it's yours. It is neither yours nor his! It's Turkish, as long as the Turk is its master! - He is right... And you picked the wrong time for quarrels and prosecutions. While we are preparing a fight for freedom and autonomy you're quarreling over a piece of land! You spent 30 Liras on Turkish courts. You could've bought 6 rifles for that money! It is not difficult to judge this matter, but under these circumstances, it's embarrassing to waste time on your trifles! It is all your fault! You could've slacked up... We had enough quarreling. We were fools, both of us! Now, shake your hands! - Enough of that! Reconcile now! Let's put an end to this! - That's it! They reconciled! I have other news for you. -As if the ones from Thessalonika do not suffice! - Katerina is pregnant. What? How come you know it? - She had pains a while ago. You've brought a pregnant woman! -How could we know? It is all your fault, Dr. House! You are safe at home in Thessalonika while women roam the mountains! She wants to stay with the American. I'll take her to a village. Take her to Ratovo to our friends. We'll be around. What does the Committee say about the kidnapping? I still haven't received the Committee's opinion. What if they don't approve? - If we succeed, they'll approve. What? Are you wavering? - No! I just don't want to compromise our Organization with this kidnapping. Don't worry! The Committee takes care of our conscience. If we compromise it, we'll lose our heads! The Revolutionary Organization had hideouts in many villages all over Macedonia. In the village of Ratovo it was in the house of the chief of the village. Go and find the village chief! Tell him to wait for us! We will go down to the village only after the nightfall. Here, have some more! Come on, Mandana! Don't be shy! A good meal it was. Here, have some! - No, thank you. You are tired... - I don't feel well... Is this your first child? - Yes. Don't worry. I'll always be around. -Cheers! Leave it! You are the guest here! When is your son's wedding? - This fall. Everything is ready. If only the Turks would leave us alone... -God help us! Come on, it's bedtime. Good night! Don't reproach her for what she said. She comes from a country where people live and think differently. She doesn't understand you. - And, how about you? I was born here. I've been hearing this since I a was child. Excuse me for asking, but I find it a little unusual... How did you became a Protestant missionary? When I was ten I lost my house and my parents in a fire. The Protestant mission took me and educated me. And your husband? Where is he from? -He is native here, too. Similar fate brought us together. We studied in the United States. Good night! Aha, taking a stroll... Go on... Only, don't go out there! Mind the dogs! They might bite you. She's asking if you'd like to secure your children. That's why I am in this outfit. Doesn't she know that my kids are the only reason I'm in these mountains. She wants you to take us down. Her friends will reward you. Me? -Yes, you! - Really! How much? You'll get as much as you ask. So, I'll get as much as I ask? Well... I want 25.000 Liras. What? You don't agree? Aren't you something? The Turks are coming! Take the women upstairs! Don't be afraid! They won't find us. Come on! Hurry! This way! Upstairs! Find Cernopeev! Tell him what's happening! Be ready to do anything! Don't be afraid! They are not here because of you. This is commander Suleiman. - What's he doing here? Collecting the taxes. He'll skin us like goats! You better go down. Sit down! Last time you received me, you told me you'll take all the necessary measures to free the American citizen Miss Stone and Mrs. Cilka from the bandits. It's been a month, and nothing has changed. His Majesty, the Sultan, is beseeching you to explain to the U. S. Government how difficult it is to catch the bandits, that are hiding in the Macedonian mountains. His Majesty ordered to do all that is necessary to free the women. Has your Excellency considered the possibility of paying the ransom to the bandits from the mountains? My Government expects you to pay the sum immediately. I am afraid this is not possible because we are not dealing with common outlaws. Miss Stone and Mrs. Cilka were taken by members of an illegal Macedonian organization. This kidnapping was carried out for special political reasons. Tell the commander to send a special battalion to Pirin. Sandanski must be destroyed and the women saved... Cost what it may! - Yes, your Excellency. Where did they go? This was found in your attic! They were in your house. Speak up, you Christian dog! Speak up! Burn the village! - Yes, Sir! We have already burnt four villages. Sandanski was here with the American. That'd be enough. Thank you, my dear! What is it? Your tooth? Wait... Here! Try some brandy. It's the best medicine. She won't. She is against drinking. -Let her just try! Have some! It'll do you good. Here! What did Hell you, eh? Mandana, they're bringing the village chief. What happened? -The Turks beat him and burnt the village. They found out that you and the women had stayed in our house. They killed twenty men... and burnt four other villages. Did you see them in the village? - Yes. -How many were there? Several battalions of infantry, cavalry and artillery. They are dragging cannons! - They can kiss my... Here! Roll one for the old man! - Mitre! Good evening, Miss Stone! Do you speak French? -A little... I can't sleep, either... I would like to talk to you. Have you heard what is going on in our villages? I sympathize with the innocent people. -If you sympathize, why don't you stop this affair? Your diplomats are pressing the vizier in Constantinople to send more troops on us. What can I do? - Ask your mission to pay! I have devoted my life to charity, and you want to buy arms. I can't support killing. A Christian doesn't return violence for violence. -For 400 years these Christians-We been standing the Turkish violence. And, it has lasted long enough. I am referring to you as a person born in a free country. You see that these people live like slaves in their own country. Or, maybe you think they should not seek for their freedom? -No! I'm only against the killing. - Is that our only point of disagreement? -I think so. - Then, what shall we do? We're devoted to our cause. Our slogan is "Freedom or Death". I have a slogan myself. And I won't give in, either. Turks are coming! - Where are they? At Crni Steni. -They can surround us. We must leave the village. - Krste, take the women across the lake. Meet me at Suvi Vrv! You, bring the women! Take cover! Turks are coming! Go up there! We must leave right away! What's the matter? - Turks are coming! You go down there! Hurry "P! The women are in the boat! Come on! Get going! The "Golden Boat" café was one of the many secret basis of the Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in Thessalonika. They are here! Good evening! This is Doctor House! -Excuse me for having to meet you here, but the police was pretty active these days. -I understand. What news do you have? -Still no news from our ambassador. Believe me, I'm doing my best. I sent a letter to the U. S. A. To collect donations, but it's going rather slowly. However, the Turkish authorities claim that Miss Stone isn't alive. And we haven't received any word from her, either. A single letter from Miss Stone could change this situation. It will do no good. It's getting hard for us to protect the women. We are surrounded by Turkish forces. -My poor Katerina! Are you aware that you are responsible for their lives? We're responsible for thousands of lives devoted to the cause! I will call on Mr. Dickenson again. That's all I can do. Katerina is due very soon. Would you like to give her some things for the baby? Diapers and things like that... I'll take it. The police are here! Have you told anyone about this meeting? -I haven't. I swear! The spindle suits him fine! - Women have tamed him well! He'll be eating out of their hands soon. -Poor Mandana! He used to be a fighter. And, look at him now! I have to go on watch now. Watch, you know... What now? The tooth again? Here! Have some... God is punishing you for torturing me this afternoon. We brought you a Christmas present. Here you are! We've also heard that on Christmas the Americans eat... I am dying to see the American plucking the turkey. I want to thank you for your kindness! -You're welcome! I'm done now! Jane! The Turks are here! - Where? -Down by the brook. We must leave at once! Mandana, take the women! We must cross the mountain and be quick. We'll only be safe on the other side. -We need at least three days to get there. We'll go straight upwards. -With the women? It's all covered with snow up there. We could hardly cross it ourselves. We must! You yourself said that the Turks could reach us here. The women are exhausted. - I know... We hardly escaped the Turks. I can't stop now. She fell again. She can't go on like this. You'll carry her! -But.. -What? We'll carry her, all right! On the other side of the mountain we'll find a shelter. There are no Turks there. - Thank you! Come on! Get up! Let's go on! Two more months have passed. Spring was approaching. The Turks have been blocking all the passages across Pirin, yet in vain. Sandanski's outfit always managed to slip away. I promised to end this campaign in two weeks. I gave my word, the word of a soldier and a bay! The operation is to be finished in a fortnight. To work now! Close the circle around Pirin. Don't let anyone out! -Yes, Sir! Poor Katerina! Giving birth in the mountains... How is she? What is it? - Can't find him, commander. Who saw Krste last? -He said he was going to the village. But, I didn't let him! Have you seen the Turkish patrols? They're everywhere! I'd rather fight then hide. - You'll fight, don't worry. Here comes Krste! Why did you go down? The Turkish patrols are everywhere. She can't make it alone. And Miss Stone is all mixed up. But, you are wounded. You could've got killed. And, what if you've dragged the Turks at us? The baby will be born tonight. We must release the women. Do you agree? There's no other solution. You'll try to make it to the valley. Alert the village militia to attack the Turks from behind. If you see the Kukus outfit, tell them to come immediately. Although... I think they are moving towards Strumica. Get ready for tomorrow! We'll have to fight Osman Bey. A baby! A baby! A baby is born in our outfit, men! Congratulations! Congratulations! - Congratulations! May it live long and may the next one be a boy! Well, I'll be leaving now... - Good bye! -Good night! It's a custom that someone wishes luck to the newborn. Who is going to bless it? - Isn't it obvious? Mandana! He's looking forward to start talking. The men want you to say a blessing to the child. May the Lord give you long and happy life. May you be the apple of your mother's eye. May you be straight as the Pirin pine. May you have the golden voice of a nightingale... For, you are our nightingale now. And, one day when you look at the big blue above and when you hear a nightingale singing, remember us. Remember the outfit in which you were born. 'Cause this outfit, my angel, fights for your freedom. You can't show her the sky now. Whistle the nightingale? song! Like a real nightingale! - I love to listen to him! I have a wish, commander! I want to christen the child. Don't rush! You'll be with your husband in a couple of days. How come? -We are releasing you. Both of you. We'll take the first possible chance to take you to a village. And, what about the ransom? - It's lost, same as the arms we wanted to buy with it. We'll find other ways to get it. Yes! Like, next year guns will grow like cucumbers! Miss Stone wants to thank you. And, I want to name my child. Who'll propose the name? - The outfit will do it. Is it a boy or a girl? - A girl. Let's name her... Autonomy! Oh, come on! Why? It's a nice name! -it's not a name for a child, Cernopeev! I have a suggestion. Elena! Do you agree with that name? - Thank you, commander! Well, it's Elena, then! Congratulations! This is Vaseline. May be useful for the baby. -What... I used it to oil the gun, but now... I'm becoming a beast! I can almost feel them coming through the darkness. - I told the men to get ready. The Turks will attack, that's for sure! When we repulse their first strike, you'll lead forward to the valley. There's no other way but to break through the Turkish lines. That night the Turks closed the circle around Pirin. Osman Bay was preparing for the final battle with Jane's outfit. A word went around the villages that the outfit was surrounded. Village militia gathered men to help. "Freedom or Death" was the oath under which hundreds of new fighters were sworn in. My fingers are stiff frozen. - Can Katerina walk? She has no choice. - Let the women be ready! The Turks don't shoot that often any more. -They are cold, too. They are waiting... For a reinforcement, maybe... Prepare the cannons! Ready! Fire! Now you know what were they waiting for. Let's move! Come on! Fire! Infantry, charge! Charge! Fire! Now! Attack! Get the cavalry! - Yes, Sir! You stay here, Mandana! Attack! The women...! Hurry! Let's go! - Wait... Lie down! Take the women away! Get behind the rock! Quickly! Come on! - No! Mandana! Mandana! Stop! Don't run! Stay where you are. Get the reinforcement! - Yes, Sir! How shall we hold this? We're just on time. Men, villagers! Freedom or Death! Halt! Stop them! Mandana... We breached the Turkish line. You have to leave right away. I'll give you an escort. But, you must hurry because the Turks are getting reinforcement. Commander, I'll write that letter. Then you'll have to stay with us. I know. I'll stay here until you get the money. How was it in Thessalonika? - See for yourself! Hallo, Jane! Good guns! - They're fine! Dickenson finally got the money from the vizier. Farewell, Katerina! - Farewell, Krste! Think of us! I know you had a rough time with us, but still... think of us sometimes! - I'll always think of you. Always! Good bye, Miss Stone! We must part here. Don't remember us by the bad stuff! -Good bye, commander! I promise that when I return to my country, I'll tell that I haven't been with some bandits. - Thank you! Good bye! Come on! Let's go!
