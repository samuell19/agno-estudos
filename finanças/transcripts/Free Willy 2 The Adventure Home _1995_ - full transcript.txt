GOOD GIRL. OH, YEAH. THERE WE GO. GOOD GIRL. HO. HO! [SINGING IN HAIDA] [CHATTERING] [CHATTERING SLOWLY] OH... WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER, JESSE. ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS LET HER SLEEP ON IT.

NOW THERE'S THREE, RIGHT IN MY HANDS. $1 MILLION EACH FOR THE TWO YOUNG ONES. 2 MIL FOR THE OLDER BROTHER. YOUNG MALES ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF THEIR BREEDING CAPABILITIES. THE OLDER BROTHER'S ALREADY TRAINED. HE'S A GOLD MINE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. DON'T WORRY. YOU'RE COVERED. LONG-TERM REHABILITATION IS WHAT I RECOMMEND. SO LONG AS IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE THE WHALES' BEST INTEREST AT HEART. YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. SURE...AND YOUR 10%. BESIDES, WE DO HAVE THEIR BEST INTEREST AT HEART. THEY'LL BE WELL CARED FOR, I ASSURE YOU. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY'RE GETTING NICE AND HEALTHY. NO REASON WHY PEOPLE SHOULDN'T PAY TO SEE THEM. RIGHT? [FERRY HORN BLOWS] AW... OH, MAN! THE SITUATION AT LAWSON REEF IS WORSENING BY THE HOUR. CLEANUP CREWS ARE FIGHTING THE SPREADING CRUDE OIL AROUND THE CLOCK. BUT THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR THE HEAVY WINDS AND STRONG CURRENTS. BENBROOK OIL NOW REPORTS THAT OIL AND GAS FUMES AND GROWING MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS, AND RESCUE WORKERS ARE PROCEEDING WITH EXTREME CAUTION. SENSITIVE COVES AND BEACHES ARE ALSO BEING BOOMED OFF TO PROTECT ENDANGERED WILDLIFE. AT CAMP MOWESTER, THREE ORCA KILLER WHALES REMAIN STRANDED. PROTECTIVE BOOMING IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. [CRYING] JESSE. JESSE! WHAT'S GOING ON? THE BOOM WILL SEAL OFF THE COVE, KEEP OUT THE OIL, AND PROTECT THE WHALES. PROTECT THEM? YOU MEAN TRAP THEM. NO, NADINE. IF THEY SWIM OUT OF THE COVE, THEY'LL SWIM RIGHT INTO THE OIL. THEY'D DIE. IF THEY'RE TRAPPED, THEY CAN'T RETURN TO THEIR FAMILY. IT'S FOR THEIR OWN GOOD. NO, IT'S NOT! NONE OF THIS IS FOR THEIR OWN GOOD! NOT HURTING THEM, NOT RUINING THEIR HOME WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THEIR OWN GOOD. IT'S ALL A BUNCH OF BULL! JESSE! I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS, KATE. WE AT BENBROOK OIL ARE PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE WE'VE ARRANGED FOR THE WHALES TO BE LIFTED OUT OF THE COVE AND TAKEN TO A MARINE RESCUE CENTER WHERE THEY CAN BE PROPERLY CARED FOR. PATRICK!
