Our ancestors, the Gauls, feared nothing - with one exception: the prospect of the sky falling down onto their heads. Up! Today, our long, three-month cruise to African shores has come to an end. My squadron's 11 "Etendard" attack aircraft will be flying until six o'clock. In the evening we'll be on the ground. I'll finally see Francoise. Hi! My poor fellows have to wait for a day before they can disembark. Tomorrow morning, "Clemenceau" will arrive in Brest. The atmosphere of this floating airfield reminds me of the college on the eve of the award ceremony. Nevertheless, an important event: Friday, June 27. The beginning of a long vacation. Now we are here. Yes. If we keep going 22 knots, we will be in Bres tomorrow at 8 in the morning, as planned. Good, excellent. Maintain 22 knots. I admit that after 3 months at sea I wouldn't mind popping up at home. I understand you. In 20 minutes aboard the plane. Is that enough? Yes, Commodore. Well, is Gaillac home? Yes, Commodore. I came to say goodbye; on behalf of my children, too. Well, I wish you and your children a happy landing. It was nice to work with you. We are also pleased to have worked with you. I am glad. And also thank you for the useful advice you gave me. Thank you, Commodore. I would like to continue working with you. I know, Gaillac. But I will not be here on the next voyage. Goodbye! Take care, Gaillac. Goodbye, sir. Take care, Gaillac. I will see you in 6 months' time, after the repairs. Thank you for the useful advice you gave me. Montford, the 13th Squadron's second-in-command has finally smiled. He is a natural-born soldier. But in peacetime, this fearsome cannot spend 3 months without eating something very tasty. Jelly... and fresh beer. Hey, Montford. I thought that pilots don't drink. You know what the pilots say? No, I don't want to know. They say that in an hour they'll be with their beloved ones. What are you carrying this for? It's too good. You have enough room, take it. Yes, it's just enormous! You have to be told everything! Come on, take it! I'll show you my recipe! No, no. Your suitcase! Wait a second! No, I'm not a cargo plane! Any volunteers? Me! Me! Choose one. Okay, let's toss a join! No, your coin is fake. No, it's not fake. What do you choose? Tails Heads! Heads! "Etendard"! Attention! Launch! "Alize" - ready for take-off. Nobody knows why Majo has joined the Navy. He has a civilian mentality, which irritates Montford and some others, who do not appreciate his voluntary service. But I like him. He's always the first to make fun of the poor "Alize" pilots. Pastel here, requesting permission for Pedro's take-off. Granted. Over and out. Attention: Pedro taking off. Laurent, my best friend on board, the pilot of a rescue helicopter. He watches over us carefully, like a herding dog guarding its sheep. 4 "Edendrads", prepare for take-off. Number 2 taking off. "Etendard" 48 not available. Roger that. Who is that? It is Montford, Commodore. He will not be happy. That's for sure. Don't lose the suitcase! Don't lose the suitcase! "HEAVEN ABOVE ONE'S HEAD" directed by: screenplay: technical advisor: music: production managers: cinematography aerial photography: edited by: chief sound engineer: produced by: executive producer: Come on, hurry! Run! Run! Here comes Majo! Majo! Majo! Thank you. Brest, 180 miles. Commodore. Yes? A secret coded message has just been received. Decoding it. Ah! Brest, midnight It would be wonderful, Bruno. Chalet, do you know what I rented in the Swiss countryside? A lonely house in the mountains. I got lucky, didn't I? Come on, fix it. Hello. Wait a moment. For you. Gaillac. Yes. Yes. Urgently? Yes. The rest? I will try to. Oh, my God! Can you refuse to do it? No, I can't. I'll be going. Hello. Yes, it's me. Well, I... No, I have a problem... Yes, yes. Seriously... Well, I don't know... Fine, I soon will. The base called. And they'll have you shot if you refuse? Well, they may... You poor thing. Turn back immediately. Bruno, vector 270, speed: 30 knots. 15 to the right, 104 on both machines. 15 to the right. They say it's exercises. We'll be back after a few hours. If we're lucky, we'll be back in the afternoon. They called all pilots. Strange. Huh? What does the message say? If you're interested ask Pasha. He's decoded it. Well, what do your clients say? Nothing, they're waiting. And what about Christmas? What did he think of it? Mr. Commodore, we cannot say that he was too pleased. It looks like they are becoming less disciplined. It affects the ship. I need to talk to him. Yes, sir. Sailor Perec on the 6th platform. You know, I was to Switzerland for a month and had everything arranged. A week later Techa came and took the children... And, well... Paris, Saturday morning The carriers, too. Should I alert the fleet? No, no. Not yet. The Minister does not want us to talk about it... For fear of arrests. "Cobra Leader" here, Gaillac with 10 "Etendards" from Brest I see you. Over. "Cobra Leader", I read you. Switching to frequency 12. Aviano, "Etendard" on your frequency. Aviano here, I read you. Prepare for the landing of 10 "Etendards" and 12 "Alizes". Over and out. Mission accomplished! 1,2,3 they're gone! All are gone, the deck is free! Come on, Gaillac. It's crucial not to plow the surface with your nose. That's for sure! Bravo! The landing gear's come out! Release sector 41. Prepare the elevator! But one's not enough! One's not enough. It's Majo. Hello! You flew here? Very strange. Say, do you know what this is about? No, you know that I don't ask too many questions. Where's Majo? He's gone. He wasn't on the deck when the alarm was sounded. I've always said that he can't be counted on. Pilot-lover You're wrong. So where is he? You never broke the rules? Never. I knew it. You're exceptional. But I'm not as great, I did brake them Prepare for the landing of an "Etendard." Come on, Majo. Align. Align, don't touch down. Slow down. Turn off the engine, moron! Damn it! Wait for me here. Something's wrong. Did you see Majo freak out? Montford's not at his quarters. So? I remember an old rule of our grandfathers: When a carrier is under attack, consider a landing to be a success. This is the case? It's easier than for the civilians. Land an airliner like this - you'll frighten the passengers. You won't get away with that - they'll kick you out. He's a civilian. So he knows what discipline means. We're staying. But you seem to care. You're right. I'm both a warrior and a bachelor. It rhymes. That goes hand in hand; they tell me to fly so I do.. Got it? Yes. If only you would rent a house for a month. True, I didn't rent a house for a month. Oh, so no more of that Your friend, Majo. What do you think of him? Majo? What Majo? Bruno, judge it yourself. The Navy spends a lot of money on this guy, and there's very little use of him. It's expensive. Has he justified his delay? I'll answer your 2 questions. 1st: it's none of your business; the Navy doesn't belong to you. 2nd Majo is a fine guy. Period. Are you serious? You know I'm never serious with you. Guys, we're 150 miles off shore; in 5 minutes there'll be no television. I have just talked to the Prime Minister. The decision has been made. Commence the "Boomerang" plan immediately. Notify the headquarters. Increase the combat readiness of all ships. Will do. Attention! Security level 1. Security level 1. All rise! At ease! Good day! As you know, we have been put on alert: Finger on the trigger. We are on the brink of war. I do not know the cause of the alarm, it was raised this morning. We are heading into open waters to be capable of maneuvering and attacking the enemy. The orders are as follows: "Alize" provide cover for anti-submarine ships. As usual. 6 "Etendards" remain on the deck on full combat alert. 2 of them, equipped with nuclear warheads - likewise. Intercept any incoming aircraft. The remaining 4 will have nuclear armament, too. Thank you, gentlemen. Over France you will be within range of the systems of controlled bombardment. There will be a single frequency. The points of no return, i.e. the points where you have to either chase an object or turn around, will be determined before take-off. All of them are located over West Germany, Austria and Northern Italy. Of course, the bomb will be armed. It can only be deactivated when ordered to. The security level is: level 1 on the plane, level 1 in the command room and again level 1 on the plane. Holidays at 6 o'clock. Planes on alert! Planes on alert! Excellent. Communications checked? Yes, sir. Good. Let's begin! Adjust it! What is it, Tessier? Incomprehensible nonsense. Shutting off the frequency. What's going on? The antennas have gone crazy. I don't know. Do we know anything? No It's very strange I've compared the constants they do not match with anything known to me. I looks like some kind of language. 2 "Alizes" taking-off! Protect the anti-submarine ships! Look, Majo is with Meunier. It's the first time I see them together. What are they talking about? A signal has bounced off the sea. It's gone now. Possibly a submarine. Roger that. The coordinates? 185, 42 miles from the carrier. Over. Roger, over and out. It's been 30 years since I saw such a thing! A border violation, and we don't know why. It's unacceptable. And when the British violate, look who's talking, then! We're not robots. Alarm for the planes! Alarm for the planes! Level 2. Everybody on board. Majo must be getting very nervous. I have no right to drag him into this. And the other pilots? What are they thinking about? What are you thinking about? Laennec, where is the submarine? Let's come to the map, sir. The submarine is here: 46 20 'N, 11 10' W. Our "Alize" is at hand. Excellent. You know that transistor radios aren't allowed on the deck! What do they say? Nothing special, commander. How long will it take? Thank you 4, 5, 6, 3rd. Well, no, no, my dear. You just didn't think about it. Yes, it is possible. Alarm for the planes! Roger that. I heard that "Alize" is tracking a submarine? Yes, I know. Probably Russian? Why Russian? Why not Portuguese? From your report I gathered that it had come from the east. You're too quick. Nothing is certain yet. For security reasons, smoking is not allowed. Did you see his face when the alarm was sounded? I did. I think he's not cut out for stuff like this. It's not for him. Do you prefer Carlie? It's not a good comparison. He signed up for it himself. Who will you take tomorrow? I'll take Majo. Captain, what Majo? I would like to What would you like? Nothing, sir. I think it's the best for you. At least until you're back on the shore. Saturday night Good morning, Mr. Lemenu. Good morning. I have noticed that you have shown great interest in "Etendard" recently. Does this bother you? No. I am fully aware that my pilots admire you. But I think that you are wrong. You ignore the lives of my thousand crew members! Because as soon as we fly away, they do not get to live long. That is true, but not entirely. There is a huge difference between the prey and the hunter. That is the case with you. Mr. Lemenu, I have a question for you. Good night, Mr. Lemenu. Good night. Hi, Marsilio. Hello. Well, what do you think of all this? I'm waiting. But it's hardly a war It seems there's enough reasons to start one, huh? Just on time, Majo Captain I need to talk to you. Come to my cabin, I also need to talk to you. Sit down, Majo. What is the matter? Is it about my unsuccessful landing? No, Captain. Everything went wrong. But I wanted to talk about something else. About a personal matter. I am listening. On Saturday evening, I was celebrating the return of my comrades and came home very late with a friend. Then I received a call from the base It is my fault I said that I was having problems. So I was unable to carry out the order at once And... At dawn, to make up for the lost time I ran to the car I was in a hurry And I ran over a cyclist. What happened next? Then I had not expected a cyclist to pop up. But he was fine. Majo, this is not Gaillac you are talking to but a superior officer! Can you swear that what you have just said this incident, hopefully genuine - was the sole cause of your delay and behavior? Yes, Captain. Well. You will be put under arrest in your cabin at once! Your delay is a sufficient justification! So I cannot be involved in the current issue? No, you cannot! Only those who can be trusted can become involved! I do not trust you, Majo. Dismissed! Oh, it's you. We have been interrupted, Mr. Lemenu. You had wanted to tell me the difference between the hunter and the prey. If I understood correctly, you meant that hunters, my pilots could ask about the missions awaiting them. Maybe so. But remember that I am the only person they can ask questions! And believe me, in such a case the military regulations are clear, concise and known to everyone! I have never doubted that. Therefore, once their mission has been accomplished, I tell them that if they have any questions, then they know who their superior is. Good night, Mr. Lemenu. Allen? I've been looking for you. Tired? No. Any problems? No. I had to deal with Lemenu. Ever since the alarm he's been around my pilots. Maybe the pilots have questions? He told you that? No, it's just a speculation. You know, you begin to realize your responsibility once you already have to take it. Yes, I'm familiar with that. I'd still rather face problems in my plane. 24 hours a day. Wouldn't you have to sleep? I'm sorry. There are duties, which I would still like to have... Only for myself. By the way, Francoise how do you get along with her? Why are you asking me about her? Just asking. Cao, I'm going to marry her. Come on You'd said that you barely knew her. I've made up my mind during my alarm fight. Well! What a news! You know, previously I'd only consider seeing her. No commitments. Unexpected situations and the risk of losing everything... But one day I realized how mad it was. Don't be so pessimistic, Bruno. You'll be back in a few days and in a year a father. It's great, you'll see. "Etendard" 38, take off immediately! What's the matter? Unidentified object at 30,000 feet. We must find out what it is. OK, right away. Prepare the airstrip for "Etendard" 38's immediate take-off. Mansart, this is Orpheus. Turn right, vector 315, 3, unit 5, over. Mansart, set on 30,000 feet. Over. Roger, setting on 30,000 feet. Mansart, 1003 miles. 1003 miles, roger. This is Pasrel, I have identified an "Air France" "Boeing", over. Roger, put me through to Mansart. Roger that. Mansart, this is Orpheus. Head back. Vector 160. Unit 6-0. Over. Do you read me? Head back. Unit 6-... Mansart, this is Orpheus. I repeat Head back. Vector 160. Unit 6-0. Over. Mansart, this is Orpheus. I repeat: Head back. Vector 160. Unit 6-0. Over. I read you! Over! A strange light! Closing in! To the right! It's coming straight at me! Straight at me! At me! At me! This is Mans Over. Over Mans, this is Orpheus, I read you. The light is gone A flash the sea All our equipment went out of order. Over! Mansart, this is Gaillac. All your equipment went out of order? Yes, but it is fine now. Roger that. Mansart, this is Orpheus. Turn left, vector 185. Unit 8-5. It's a 6-minute walk to the ship. Descend to 20,000 feet, over. Roger that. Listen! Mansart saw something incredible! He got attacked by a UFO, huh? Mansart! He's coming back! Back on the surface! Captain Wait! Prepare the plane! Montford, check it out. Mansart, calm down. I am listening. I was about to turn around to intercept the "Boeing" when a light ahead of me attracted my attention. At first I thought it was a star, but then it started making sharp turns, it was incredible! That light, what was it? I will tell him my story later on. What happened to the plane? But the light The plane! I was blinded for a moment. I could see the light fade away. The gauges went crazy, a deafening noise came from the speakers. It was as if The plane is ready, Captain! Mansart! Are you sure that this light was not a lantern? I am sure about that! I told you that Mansart had been hallucinating. The plane is completely undamaged. During the control possibly so. But it could've been damaged when Mansart was airborne. You mean I don't mean to say anything! I'm off to bed. Good night. They won't believe me I know! You have a vivid imagination. It'll destroy you. Sunday morning Alarm for the planes! Hey, Mansart! They're laughing at you? Come, have a seat. So, last night, there was a No, really, what was that light? Berdac, it was ahead of me, shining incredibly and it can't have been a star. Maybe a meteorite, then? Maybe. Well, no. It was motionless in relation to the stars. And then it rushed at me at an amazing speed. What did you say? Nothing. No, nothing. Waiter! Coffee, please. 17 minutes This time it'll take 17 minutes. What will take 17 minutes? It'll take the Russian missiles 17 minutes to reach us. It'll be either plunging fire or grazing fire. If it's the former, 17 minutes will suffice. If the latter only 12, but the accuracy will suffer. Like this. We should be seeing it now. What would you say, Mr. Minister? Well, I had better say something. What do we tell our subordinates? The truth. If it is a ship I believe it. The matter is too serious and complicated for a newspaper article. It would be better if the "Clemenceau" command explained it to you personally. Captain Ravesne would not mind meeting you under such circumstances. He is a friend of yours? Yes, Amiram. O Lord, our God, we pray that in Your loving kindness those whom You ceased not to restore with the divine sacraments Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who with You lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, world without end. Amen. Is Mansart's plane still here? It's radioactive. We'll all get contaminated I'm telling you! Come in. Captain. Go ahead. Well, sir... Is everything fine? It turns out that the planes are radioactive. People want to know We were not told why the war broke out. First of all, there is no war! And who told you that the planes were radioactive? Men from the deck, quarters number 4. And from the cafeteria, too. It is not the planes, but one plane. And it is nothing special. It has happened. But I wish we spoke less about it. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Get up. You have to remain under observation. Visit me as soon as any symptoms appear: nausea, headaches, pain, vomiting, a mild rash. And, of course no flying until next year. "Alize" coming back from Paris! Prepare for the landing! Greetings. Let me lead the way. Hello! Hi, Gaillac! Hello! Is everything okay? How do you do, how are things on the mainland? The season starts off promisingly: The Parisians come and We asked about the alarm. It's a drill, everybody knows that. Good morning! Good morning! You have a lot to tell me about. Does it show? Come on. Leave us. I am glad to see you aboard the "Clemenceau" Thank you. I wish it was under different circumstances. Well, what happened? Since last night, 2000 people have been asking the same question. No doubt. Here, look. Attention! In 5 minutes everyone is to report to the Captain! We'll finally learn what's going on! Be careful, do not say too much, I know them well and you seem to have forgotten some things. Well, begin You can begin, Commodore. Hurry up, Marcel. Fine. Yesterday morning, when the shore was in sight, I ordered you to head for the open waters. A few hours later I had the combat readiness increased. You were told nothing. Like you, I had been following orders. Captain Boyco came from Paris and explained the situation to me. The alarm is genuine, this is not a drill. On Friday morning, a huge satellite was detected above the Earth. Its properties are so unusual that it probably is of a military nature. Who launched it? That we do not know. The Western powers not only refuse to study the object together but they also accuse each other of launching it. Their defence forces have been put on high alert. According to our intelligence the USSR has adopted similar measures. Who reacted adequately? Who is playing a charade? One thing is certain, and we want you to understand it: Never before has humanity been on the brink of such a horrific war. This is what I wanted to tell you. Now Captain Boyco will tell you what we know about this satellite. On Friday, at 5:12 GMT French space stations detected an object with an orbital radius of 7350 km. The British informed us that they had detected it a few minutes earlier - at 5:03 GMT. As for the Americans, they did confirm the detection, but refused to elaborate. Soon, our observers became amazed by the satellite's highly unusual behavior. Its speed and altitude were constantly changing. It was emitting electromagnetic waves. And radiation, too. Everything seemed to have stabilized, when, suddenly, something even more unusual occured. The satellite slowed down for a few minutes, hovered over the East Coast of the USA and entered a completely different orbit. Until Friday such capabilities could only been dreamed of. Its current altitude is no more than 370 km. Due to its size, it is now visible to the naked eye. Even today, as of now. Stop! True! You can see the satellite! What happened? Have them dispersed at once! Clear the deck! Get off the deck! Clear the deck, spread up! All hands, spread up! Come on! Come on! Attention, everyone! This is the Captain of "Clemenceau". Return to your seats immediately. You have misunderstood Captain Boyco's words! As we do not know the location of the satellite, it is not visible from the ship. I order everybody to return to their seats. I told you there is no use talking. I do not understand. Today's technology. Even today, people and machines are not the same thing! The threat is serious. Should the satellite be carrying a bomb, then at any moment it can be dropped anywhere in the world. We need to determine how long it will take us to react once it attacks. How long will it take to deploy the aircraft? The "Mirage" 5 minutes, Mr. Minister. The "Etendard" 8 minutes. What do the Russians say? Nothing. They have been silent since they refused to cooperate. Surprising, since the Russians, as far as I know, are still unable to create and deploy vehicles of such dimensions and capabilities. Such advanced satellites require solutions to many problems. Is is astonishing. And it is above us. It will be an intense day. Really. All this incredibly fascinating technology. Yes I will distribute the instructions, everyone is to be on high alert. I got used to it. Well, I must go. Drink a cup of coffee. I will have to postpone the flight. No, I'm sorry, they are waiting for me in Paris. I have to hurry. Yes? I thought that you would serve me a bit more. I'm not making much sense. You have shown me your great ship. And these orbital tricks. Prepare for take-off! Team 5, the route is clear. You can ride down the elevator. This is the Earth. This is the orbit, on which the satellite is rotating. A complete turn takes about 66 minutes. The Earth's rotation allows it to reach most parts of the world and attack it with a remote-controlled thermonuclear bomb. It might have been there for several years. It is a constant and a serious threat. The only means of striking it is to deploy nuclear-armed anti-ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, scoring a hit will be difficult. The Russians have a huge army. Russians! All the time Russians! Why Russians? If it was the Americans, we wouldn't be here now! So there are only the Russians and the Americans?! The satellite can't be theirs! Oh, you don't think that it's Chinese?! I didn't say "Chinese", I said "not theirs"! Then whose? From another planet, for example. Listen, Loro! It's no time for goofing around! I'm not. I just refuse to dismiss a theory just because it's not in the manual! What should we read? Science fiction?! And why not? For me, there's no doubt! For me there is! So, how about you play with your helicopter above the ship instead? You're put on combat alert no more nonsense! Believe me! Mansart, come back! I understand that many of you are exhausted. Keep in mind, there are people like you with the same responsibility elsewhere. They, obviously, ask the same questions. We've been put on alert. On alert it's not a war yet. Jules Verne had also written science fiction His "Nautilus" has always made me smile. Alarm for the planes! What an amazing machine, Montford. But this machine... When I'm not in the air, a danger awaits me here. Montford, what an awful guy. Doesn't think, rushes, smashes and destroys everything in sight. Like a bulldozer. A tank. It's changing orbit! We've detected a 2nd signal! The satellite split in two! What? We have 2 reflected signals. Roger, over and out. Yes, I am listening. Good morning, Mr. Minister. Good morning, Boyco. Good morning! You're back already? Yes, 4 hours of flight, 2 on board. What is Raven doing? Waiting. All of them are. Well, thank you. A relatively small object departed from the satellite. It is constantly decreasing. If this continues, it will hit the ground in 21 minutes. Where? In the east of the USA. Listen. Understood. The British confirm our calculations: The satellite is over Africa now. Sound the alarm immediately. The countdown has begun. The submarines are ready to attack. The strategic bombers have taken off. They are on course for the USSR. They will reach the point of no return in 18 minutes. Shall we begin the operation? Wait, Mr. Minister, there is no hurry. We run the risk of making a horrible mistake. There is nothing to suggest that these vehicles are hostile, including the one seemingly headed for the USA. There is nothing to suggest that they are Soviet. The Russians deny having launched them. Listen to me. When, we, humans, want to fly to another planet, we send a space vehicle on its orbit that dispatches astronauts in small capsules. Doesn't it sound strikingly similar to what we've been witnessing for the past 2 days? Can you attest that this satellite does not come from another planet? The parts that detached their purpose may be research, not warfare. Mr. Minister, the vehicle will reach the USA in 14 minutes. Its incredible technology proves its extraterrestrial origins. It is far beyond our reach. Go ahead; For you, Mr. Minister. Hello! Yes, Mr. Prime Minister, immediately. The USSR has just launched missiles from its Ural bases. They are heading west, for Europe and the USA. Announce it through the loudspeakers. Announce it through the loudspeakers. Yes, Gaillac. Combat alarm. According to the latest data, the Soviet missiles are aimed at the vehicle, not the USA. The Soviet base is indeed the nearest. The Soviet missiles are more than 60 km away from the vehicle. 50 km. 40 km. 30 km. 20, 10, 0. Mixed signal. Signal lost. The Russians have hit it. We continue monitoring the main part of the satellite. All planes, take off. All planes, take off. The object has just hovered over the area, where the missile had destroyed its detached part. Ove the Atlantic. It is descending towards the sea. This is Montford! My equipment is malfunctioning! I can no longer track the object! All "Etendards" respond! All "Etendards" over! This is Orpheus. Order them to return immediately! Prepare for the "Etendards" ' landing! Prepare for the "Etendards" ' landing! 2 "Etendards" 41 and 59, are not responding! Quickly! Get the flares! Look! Look! Radar failure! Alarm radiation! Alarm radiation! Alarm radiation! This is Pedro! Over! No entry! Ammunition transfer. You can't go there! Radiation level increasing! Radiation level increasing! There must be something wrong here! What about the other gauges? I don't get it... They've gone crazy! Montford! This is Gaillac, over! Carlie! Carlie! This is Gaillac, over! I'm falling! I'm falling! 7, 8, 9, 10 This is Captain. Level of security - 0! Evacuate the personnel. Security level 0! Security level 0! Security level 0! Security level 0 confirmed. Lock the vents! External ventilation locked! Take the precautions against radiation! Turn on the anti-radiation shower. This is Pasrel, turn on the anti-radiation shower. Roger, Pasrel. Aaaaargh! Help! Montford and Carlie, any news? One's bailed out. The other one's not responding. Immediate dive! Stabilize at 15 meters. We'll pick the pilot up... after that plane has left. Radiation level on the surface? Keeps increasing. And below? No radiation. Thank you. The radiation has stabilized. "Etendard" to the right! Prepare for the landing! Turn off the anti-radiation shower. Montford or Carlie? Left, 10 . [Left, 10 .] [Left, 10 complete] Excellent. Radiation! Evacuate immediately! Evacuate immediately! This is Lieutenant Gaillac. Yes, sir. Montford and Carlie. Well, did you find out? 60, 0 95. - Well, you have to fly. - Wait. Commodore, Laurent is requesting permission to take off. Handing it over to him. But, Commodore, once we know his location I will have to fly. But, Commodore! I insist! I... He's right. By the time you find him, if you do, and bring him back, it'll have been too late. The governments of the USSR and the USA have agreed to mutually attempt to destroy the satellite using all means available. Its current altitude allows us to deploy anti-ballistic missiles. We are putting you through to the launch center. The countdown has begun. 500, above the norm. I saw the satellite. Up there, motionless. It's huge. Shines like a star. Emanates like the Sun. What about Carlie? He bailed out. A Russian submarine surfaced near him. I fired at the space between them. What? I wanted to stop them from taking Carlie. It dived. I haven't seen it again. You shot at the Russians, satisfied? That submarine was Carlie's only hope. The only way out! No, not a way out! A cruise to where? Stop it! Commodore! The satellite is climbing. The Soviet and American missiles are beyond control. The satellite is travelling vertically at an incredible speed! Altitude: 150 km, 175, 210, 265, 500! But... 20,000 km! 28,000! 35,000! The satellite is gone. Call back level 0, turn off the shower. [Yes, Commodore.] This is Pasrel, turn off the anti-radiation shower. Roger that, proceeding. We have received orders from our government. We apologize for this unfortunate misunderstanding. You are free. Commodore. Yes? The radio is working again. Good. This is Carlie. This Saturday morning, June 29, man still has to find an answer. He still needs to learn, he still needs to experience. But he will continue looking up in the sky. Maybe this time, with different eyes.
