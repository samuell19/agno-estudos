(suspenseful music) - Don't know if this is a classic Kalashnikov or not. I'll speak to my Russian buyers about it. - Yeah, I like this here. Yes, yes. Well, Lord have mercy. Christmas done came early this year. Boy, look here. We gonna make a lot of money off these. - My contacts in Syria will be quite pleased. - I'm pretty sure they will. - Leaving me out to dry, I see. - Sorry I'm late, man. I had something pop up. - Man, Thomas sitting in the back. You better go check in. - You're late. - Yeah, well I'm here now. Ain't I? Come on, man. Quit sweating me. - Yes. Well, your inability to tell time has thrown us completely off schedule. - Hey, man. Whatever. - Me and this man have some business to take care of. You guys, grab the stuff, take it into the back. - It appears you've grown quite fond of your new mate. His confidence amongst a den of thieves is disconcerting. - Man I told you I'd take care of my side. You had one job to do, besides worrying, make sure that we got a buyer. - Have I ever let you down? - No, but you pissing me off. All my guys are legit. I never get compromised. If I do, I shoot my way out. (gun cocks) - Don't let your emotions get in the way of business. (suspenseful music) (gun cocks) - Sweet. Yeah. Oh, yeah. - Oh, man. Boy, we got a lot here. - Yeah. - Sweet. - Yeah, it's a bad boy. - Oh, yeah. Hit that last (speaker mumbles). Whole army, take out. - Yeah. - Freeze, FBI! - Get on the ground. Get (speaker mumbles). (gunshots ring) - Back away. Back away. No! (more gunshots ring) - Give it up, Magnus. You're surrounded. It doesn't have to end like this. - I bloody knew it. - Give it up. - So, what's your real name, Nate? (gunshots ring) (helicopter engine rumbles) - Hello and welcome to "The World Tonight." I'm Mary Jacobs with breaking news of an apparent raid in the downtown area. Let's go live to Jennifer Mickle on location now. Jennifer, can you fill us in on what's happening? - Thank you, Mary. I am standing here in the aftermath of what appears to be a raid on a large cache of weapons, confiscated from the notorious arms dealer, Magnus Valteri, who's just been taken down. With me is Special Agent Jason Cole, who's tirelessly been working on this case. Special Agent Cole, can you please tell the viewers a little bit about what has happened here tonight? - After an ongoing investigation, we were finally able to locate the operations of Mr. Valteri. Several of my men were able to then confiscate a stash of weapons, as well as apprehend all dealers involved. Now, Mr. Valteri, as well as several of his gang members, refused to comply and or surrender, and lost their lives in doing so. It was not the outcome we had all hoped for, but many civilians lives, as well as many of the lives of my colleagues were at stake and a difficult decision had to be made. I always strive to do the right thing. What must be done will be done. We can all rest assured now knowing that the streets are much safer that those weapons out of the hands of those criminals. - Thank you, Agent Cole. - Thank you. - You heard it here first. The notoriously dangerous arms dealer, Magnus Valteri, has been shot and killed in a massive raid downtown. I will give you more facts as they emerge. Back to you. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - All right. Thank you. Thank you. I'll take two coffees, please. Thank you. - Sorry, I'm late. - Hey, baby. - You're not gonna arrest me, are you? - Glad I left my handcuffs at home. Look at my baby. Look at you. Working hard. - Trying not to. - See. Come here. I got something for you. - Okay. What is that? Jason. - Happy anniversary, baby. All for you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - You'll get your gift later tonight. - We can leave right now. Just say the word. - Stop. Did you put in our coffees? - Yeah, she went to go get them. - Okay. We have cheers to you. - Okay. - And to us. Oh, here she is. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Happy anniversary, baby. - Happy anniversary. - Excuse me. I mean, Senior Agent Cole. - Listen, I'm just glad you were able to take some time from work just to meet me for breakfast. You know? I know this isn't your five star, candlelit, romantic-- - Don't forget the handcuffs. - You wanna make me forget the keys. Come here, you. Come here. (waitress clears throat) - Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Cole. - Good Morning. - Morning. - Are you ready to order? - Yes, I think so. - Yes, please. Can I have the mushroom and cheese omelet and an English muffin, please? - [Waitress] And for you, sir? - And I'd like the Crab Benedict. - Excellent choices. I'll be back to freshen up your coffee. - Thank you. - I'll be sure to knock next time. - Thank you. - Thank God it's a light day at work today. I know it's been difficult with my new schedule being six to six, but at least now we get to see each other. - Yeah, yeah. I mean with you working nights and me working days... Baby, I've missed you. - I missed you more. And now that the fellowship is over, I just have to figure out which hospital offer I'm gonna accept. - I thought you chose John Hopkins. - I did, but then Mass General countered. So, now I'm still... I don't know. I'm not so sure again. - Well, I mean, it's no need to rush. I'm sure you'll make the right decision for your career. And for us. I know you have a full schedule and I want to take you outta town this weekend. - Yes, please. Please. - I figured you'd say that. I just need us to spend some time together. - Where are we going? - That, I'm not gonna tell you. You just gonna have to trust me. - I trust you. - Okay. - So, there's a third option that I'm considering now. Mercy actually was hoping that I would start my practice here. And with your promotion and both of our salaries now can support us and a baby. What? - Listen, baby. Look. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, okay. You know, as good as anybody, there's nothing and more that I want in this life than to start a family with you. You know-- Hey, you know that. - Jason. - Baby, are we ready? - Yes. - I mean, are you ready? We haven't even eaten breakfast and you've already started charting out the next 10 years of our life. I mean... - You know I want a family, Jason. We've talked about this, right? And now you switching from major to white collar crimes. I can now rest easier knowing that I won't be widowed or a single parent. We'll be doing it together. - Right. But you also wanna start your practice. Right? And you want to have a successful career. I'm just trying to figure out how to square away some time with you. That's it. - I want more, Jason. Actually, I want it all. I want it all and I want it with you. - Baby, it's our anniversary. Can we just.. Can we keep it about us, please? - Jason, how can it be about us when one of us continues avoiding the topic that means more to me than it just being us? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Baby. Hey. Food's getting cold. Come on. Let's eat. - [Savannah] Yeah. It's good. Have to try the beer garden. - Beer garden? - Couple in the far corner, (speaker mumbles). - Oh, I gotta get back. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you too, baby. See you tonight? - Have a good day. Yes. - Thank you. Wait. What's this? - Courtesy of the gentleman in the table to the left. Guess he's modest. Happy anniversary. - Okay. Thank you. All right. - [Tyrell] Did you see the Braves game last night? Swanson's really panning out, man. I was in the stands his first at bat, man. They sucked that season, but... Yeah, I'm gonna miss this city. - [Jason] Right. Let's do it. All right. - I don't know what you did to get a ride this sweet, but I tell you what, if I get something half this nice when I make it to New York, I'll be a happy man. - Hey, listen. This is just some of the perks of being a senior agent, man. Take down you a couple bad guys. Bust a couple operations, you'll get one too. - Yeah, yeah. So, happy anniversary. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - How'd it go? - It went well. It went well. - Let me guess. You took her to the spot, right? - I did. I did. Hey, if it ain't broke. - Don't fix it. - Don't you fix it. All right. - So, what'd you get her? - I got her a pendant. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Nice. - She enjoyed that. - She happy? - Yeah. - What, she's still like trying to get you to actually settle down and actually be a grownup? What are you waiting for, man? What? You waiting to make more money? Or do better in your career? I think you-- - Tell you what. I'll tell you what. We'll get to that later. Are you ready for this meeting? - Am I ready for this meeting? - Yes. - I was born ready for this meeting. - Well, let's go. - I am the master of fine arts. - Maybe you can get to one of them. - Yeah. (speakers laugh) All right. After you, sir. - All right. Thank you, sir. - Can anyone identify this painting that's before us? - It's a Jean Paul Paviour, "The Essence of Her." - Impressive, Agent Smith, but wrong. - While a good guess for my fellow colleague here, it's actually a forgery of a Jean Paul Paviour, "The Essence Of Her." As you can all see here, this painting is a combination of gouache and watercolors, late 19th century mixed with a yellow dextrin as a binding agent. This helps the painting dry with a heavier composition, therefore making it more reflective under LED lighting, like the ones in this conference room. - Good eye, Agent Cole. - Kiss ass. - This morning, I received a tip from our CI that more paintings from this specific collection are preparing to hit the auction. We have every reason to believe that they're all forgeries. The authentic paintings are going to the black market very soon. Agent Smith, Agent Cole. I want you two as points on this. - Well, let's do it, Picasso. - Let's do it. You ready for the big move? - Yeah. Yeah, man. I am. I'm not so sure about Morgan. Might be some changes happening soon. - Speaking of changes. Savannah laid it on me pretty thick this morning. - Yeah. - You know? She wants to start her practice and have a baby. And all of this within the next year. - Yeah. I know. It's a lot to deal with. But come on, man. Don't you think it's maybe about time that... Listen, I got something to tell you. I got some news. - Okay. You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. It's happening, man. - Okay. What's happening? - We're pregnant. She's pregnant. - No way. - Yes. - What? - Yeah. Yeah. I didn't think it was possible. You know? What, it's been two years we've been trying. - Wow. - She's pregnant. - Wow. - We're having a baby. - Hey, congratulations! (cellphone buzzes) Hey, um I'm gonna need a favor. - Okay. - I'm gonna go meet up with Savannah for lunch. You mind covering for me? - Of course. Tell her hello and happy anniversary. - Will do. Congratulations on that again, man. That's amazing. All right. - All right. - I shouldn't be too long. I'll be back. All right. - Cool. See you soon, man. (calm piano music) - Hello. Table for two, please. - Good afternoon, sir. - Hello. - There will be two of you? - Yes. - Perfect. I will return when she arrives. - Thank you. Oh, by the way, it's our anniversary. For dessert, do you mind bringing us something special? Maybe strawberries and chocolate. - I'll see what the chef can do for you. - Thank you. (calm piano music continues) - Good afternoon. Perhaps you can help me with the dilemma I've been facing. - Unless it's um how to find your own table, I'm afraid I can't help you. Sorry about that. - If you had the choice between saving the lives of everyone in this room and saving just one life, what would you do? - Listen, buddy. I'm not sure if this is some kind of joke. Let me help you find-- - Let's just say, hypothetically, that there was a bomb in this room, and you'd face the task of choosing to save the lives of everyone, or just one person. - Look, I don't know who the hell you are. - We go way back Time is of the essence. Please, have a seat. - Look, my wife will be here soon and I don't know what your angle is. - Savannah. - How do you know my wife? - If you want to know why she's tardy, I suggest you take your seat. Please order. It's on me. - That was you. - I hope you enjoyed your anniversary breakfast. Courtesy of my unwavering generosity. - Where's my wife? - Are you always this incessant? She's perfectly fine for now. Whether or not she remains that way is entirely up to you. - Who are you? - Back to my more pressing dilemma. If you had the choice between saving the lives of everyone in this room or the life of just one, what would you do? - Of course, this is all hypothetical? - Maybe. Maybe not. - I'd wanna know my options. I'd wanna know the full scope before I made any decisions. - The full scope, eh? - Yeah. - [Waitress] Happy anniversary. What can I get you to start-- - Not now! - Okay. Mr. Full Scope. Hear me and hear me well. (cellphone buzzes) - Hey, man. Where the hell-- - I've strategically placed two bombs throughout the city. (suspenseful music) You're going to have to make a decision, Jason. Do you save the lives of hundreds or even thousands of people? Or do you save the life of just one person? The choice is yours. - Is there anything else I should know? - Ah, yes. Perhaps I should clarify, so there are no misunderstandings. You save the life of hundreds of people, or... Your wife. - Agent Greene! - Help me! Help me! Somebody! Jason! (Savannah cries) - Check this out. - If you hurt her, I will-- - Shoot me? That would be unfortunate. I mean, if I die, then both bombs would go off, and all those innocent lives would be on your hands. There goes that white picket fence. - What do you want from me? - Take a look at my feed. In less than two hours, or if this feed goes viral and it reaches 2 million viewers, both bombs will detonate. Allow me to send you the link. Oh, and before I forget. I'd be remiss if I didn't share this with a few of my faithful followers. (cellphone notifications pop up) - Send me that link now. I'll have the cyber crimes division track down that IP address. And I'll send a car to the restaurant as backup. Okay. (keyboard keys click) (suspenseful music) - Jason, I fancy myself as somewhat of a fair guy. So, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll disclose the locale of one of the bombs, but only one. - I have the physical location of the IP address. Has the suspect disclosed the whereabouts of these two alleged bombs? - No, and I don't get this sordid social media game he's playing. I mean, why Jason, Savannah? - I'm sending a team there now. - I'm going. - No, I think it's best you stay here. - Well, I need to see for myself who the sick son of a bitch is. Jason'll uncover the bombs. Let me find out who planted 'em. - The bomb squad is on standby in case he drops a hint anything that'll lead us to these bombs. - Please. No more views. Don't you realize that once this thing goes viral, it's gonna detonate? - We're doing all that we can. - We are the damn FBI. Can't we block it? Do something! - So, is she your decision? You're stalling, Jason. Do you save her life or hundreds? Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick... - I need to go to the bathroom. - Tick tock. Tick tock. - Hey. Hey. FBI. Gimme your phone. Gimme your phone. You can pick it up from the host stand in a hour. (keyboard keys click) - Agent Smith. - [Jason] Hey, buddy. - Hey. One moment. I'm putting you on speaker. Williams. - Listen. I think I know where the bombs are. I'm in the bathroom. I've seen that room before. It's in a hospital. - The hospital. Wait, wait, which one? - Mercy. Mercy. I think both bombs are there. - Wait, are you sure? We have the IP address from the live feed and it's not a hospital. It's a different address. Yeah, it's a warehouse on Lucky Street. We're heading there now. - Wait, the addresses are different? - [Tyrell] Yeah. We'll head to the warehouse, clear it and make sure Savannah isn't actually there. - Something's not right about this, Ty. - Listen. I need you to listen to me closely. You need to stay calm. Let this guy think that he's in charge, but I need you to know he is not. We are. Agent Greene is aware of the situation. The bomb squad is on its way. I got you. Okay? But you stay calm and you keep this son of a bitch occupied. - [Jason] Find her. - Jason, I'm on it. - I know you're probably a great person who just needs something and you just need to tell me what it is, and I can help you. - Oh, I took the liberty of ordering you a salad. You must be famished by now. I hope you washed your hands. - I've made my decision. - Which is? - I choose thousands. - "What must be done, shall be done." Isn't that what you always say? - Yeah, it's what I live by. Service, doing what's right. - What you live by, admirable? But who will you die for? The line between good and evil passes through every person. We're all sinners, Jason. - You know, without free will, there'd be no justice. We all have a moral responsibility to take action against those who harm anyone, 'cause harm to one is harm to us all - My God, Jason. You're practically the bastion of manhood and service. - Where's the bomb, huh? I've made my decision. I can live without your admiration. Now who's stalling? - Mercy General. - Who puts a bomb in a hospital? - [Tyrell] Son of a bitch. Jason was right. - [Agent Greene] Smith. - Mercy General. Bastard put a bomb in a hospital. - I'll inform the bomb squad. Have you found the location of the IP? - No. We're having a hell of a time finding it too. As soon as we make contact, I'll let you know. I need an ETA. - [Officer] You got 10 minutes, sir. - Let's go. - We've just been informed of a bomb threat at Mercy Hospital. Evacuations are already underway. Our bomb squad is en route. - We have just been evacuated from the scene at Mercy General Hospital where an alleged bomb threat has local police scrambling to clear the area. SWAT teams are arriving now to sweep the building. And while there is no word yet on a possible suspect, we will be right here, keeping you updated as new information arrives. Back to you. (suspenseful music) - [Agent Greene] Jason, are you okay? - Yeah. - [Agent Greene] Is he close by? - Yeah. - What's your status? - I'm here, but there's a bomb at Mercy General. You need to send a squad out now to disarm it. - We're already on it. Give me more details. Are there any hostages? - That's all I know. - [Agent Greene] I promise you, we're gonna find out who he is. - [Savannah] Help me. - I've done what you asked. I've made my choice. Now, where is she? - Are you always this testy? The bomb is still ticking and my viewership is rising. Who knew I was an influencer? - Influencer, huh? My team will find that bomb. And you will tell me where Savannah is. - You're placing the cart before the mule. The clock is still ticking. I don't envy you, Jason. All those precious lives in your hands. - Any word from Homeland Security? - [Woman] No word yet. - Patch me into the local authorities. - Going down. (telephone rings) - [Bomb Tech] Exiting elevator. Approaching electrical room. Door code. I've made access. - Proceed with caution. - I notice four, five units. Looks like C4. (speaker mumbles) connected to Iphone. Attached to a metal cache. - Of course, your confidence isn't without merit. And right on time too. I'm sure they'll be able to disarm it in the next 15 or 20 minutes. Plenty of time. - You think you're so smart, huh? You got this whole thing figured out. Tell you what. I could arrest you right now. But, you and I both know that won't save my wife. Now, will it? But the satisfaction of me killing you with my bare hands-- - Except, is pummeling it out of me really the right thing to do? Of course it would give you some sort of immediate satisfaction, but... It won't change what will happen. - And I've never seen anything like this one before. I'm gonna figure it out. (suspenseful music) (man breathes heavily) Okay. I'm afraid (speaker mumbles) might be really high. Let's see. (suspenseful music continues) We got 58 seconds and counting. I'm cutting, guys. The bomb's been disarmed. It's disarmed. (telephone rings) - We're not out of the woods yet, Agent Smith. Find her. - [Tyrell] I'm working on it. (somber piano music) - You going to pummel me now? Arrest me? - I'm not. But they are. - [Officer] Got him. (man speaks over radio) - Come on, Tyrell. - What's the ETA? - [Man] We're coming up right now on site. We're beginning our sweep. - Help me! Help me! Help me! (police sirens blare) (officer speaks over radio) - You, you. I need to know how many exits there are, and that it matches the exact number that we have here on this layout. Now, this building hasn't been occupied for years, so it shouldn't be too difficult to pinpoint her location. (cellphone buzzes) (suspenseful music) (telephone rings) (people chatter) - [Savannah] Help me. - You got something? All right, let's roll. All right, this room's clear. I got nothing. (Tyrell breathes heavily) What the hell? I got a door. I hear something. I'm moving to enter. Clear. (bomb explodes) - Think you can kill my family? Oughta kill you with my bare hands. - I didn't kill your friends. You did. - Get off me! - Yeah. That's the problem, Jason. You think you're in control, but you're not. What are you feeling right now? Anger? Helplessness? Look at you. Engulfed in the familiar soul-crushing, paralyzing realization of losing someone close to you. - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - Check your feed, Agent Cole. (suspenseful music) - That's my wife! That is my wife! - Hey! - That is-- - Let go. Out. You need to calm down. We have prints on our bomber. Chemical engineering major who specialized in thermodynamics. It explains the expert bomb-making. European. His mom died during childbirth. He relocated to the US in 1995. Jason, his name is Nikolai Valteri. - Valteri? - Son of Magnus. (gunshots ring) - Magnus Valteri. - Hey. You're an agent. Remember who you are. - So, what is this? Huh? Some sort of revenge for me killing your father? - Jason, "A man that studieth revenge, keeps his own wounds green, which would otherwise heal." - Your father flooded the streets. Innocent people, children, died at the hands of his operation. - One day, my father took me to the beach. I was about seven. It was fall and it was too cold to even dip your feet in the ocean. But we walked down the beach. Waves chasing us. Picking up shells and stones, while the waves crest on the beach and the seagulls cawed. We found a little shack. We had a simple lunch. We headed back. Our bellies full. My hand in his. I don't remember him saying a word that day. Either of us actually. But I remember how happy I was. Just me and my father, together, out for a walk. You took that from me. Here's the deal. My freedom for your wife's location. - What did you just say? - I think you heard me. (somber piano music) - Look. I know what you did was difficult, but do you know how many lives you saved? You're a hero, Jason. - Any whereabouts on Savannah? - We're working with cyber crimes and we're doing all that we can do. - But you still haven't found her? - We're doing all-- - Then where is she? - I'm sorry, Jason. - Get up. - Shall we? - Shut your mouth. - I love it when we play-- - Shut up! Where's my wife? - Uncuff me. And my phone. As soon as I'm in my car, I'll send you the location. - How do I know I can trust you? - What other choice do you have? - So you just happen to have a personal valet pull up right outside an FBI headquarters, huh? - Only a touch away. (chair rattles) (Savannah cries) - Help me! He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. - Cyber crimes division informed me they have the location of the second bomb. Where's Cole? They have her. 1410 Robinson Lane. - I'm going in. Fellas, fellas. How much time we got? - 10 minutes. No known hostiles in the area, but we're not a hundred percent on that. - All right. Well, we all know what happened to Agent Smith. Okay? This isn't just for me, this for him as well. All right? Check your targets. Check your background. Let's roll. Let's go. - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) (door creaks open) - Baby. Baby, baby. Hey. - [Officer] Clear. - What the f-- - [Savannah] Get me outta here. - Target acquired. Get the bomb unit in here-- - Hey, on the fly. Let's go. Let's go. Now. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey. Relax. Relax. Imma get you outta here. - Get me out, please. - Hey, look. Hey, hey. I'm gonna get you outta here. Hey, I'm gonna get you out. Lets go, now! - [Officer On Radio] (speaker mumbles) with the suspect or with the victim? - I need everyone outta here. - Hey, I'm not going nowhere. This is my wife. Let's go. - RGB. RGB. RGB. (suspenseful music) This bomb is different from the first one. I need to get over here. Okay. (suspenseful music continues) (telephone rings in background) - Come on, man. What's wrong? - Just give me a minute. - We don't have a minute. Let's go. Let's go. - Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Relax. - I got two hooks. (Savannah cries) - He's gonna get you outta here. Hey, look at me. He's gonna get you outta here. - What's happening? Why is it taking so long? - All right. We got you. - Hey. Hey. - [Bomb Tech] We got a little more. - Hey, relax. Hey. Come on, relax. - [Bomb Tech] Bomb neutralized. - Oh shit. Baby. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. I told you. Okay. (Savannah cries) Hey. Come on. Hey, what'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Didn't I tell you? I got something for you. You forget something? Baby. - We're back. And what you just witnessed was the dramatic rescue of Dr. Savannah Cole, who was held hostage earlier today in a plot to bomb two buildings in the downtown area, potentially killing thousands of civilians. The mastermind behind these bombs live streamed the event for the whole entire world to see. And the viewership amassed a whopping one... (cellphone buzzes) - You sleep good? - I, did. You okay? (somber piano music) - Agent Cole. I need to speak with you now. Agent Cole, why didn't you come to me before you took matters into your own hands? It was unsanctioned. It was reckless. - What was I supposed to do, huh? Pray for some sort of miracle? You looked me in my eyes with minutes left on that bomb. And you told me you didn't know where Savannah was. - We had every unit on the case. We tracked her location. - With minutes to spare. - What am I supposed to say? You're a senior agent, Cole. I can't brush this away. - Okay. I didn't ask you to. - This agency has a system in place that you disregarded when you took that criminal out the back door. - This agency, this very same agency, let my partner, my friend, die right in front of my eyes. And I'd be damned if I was gonna let the same thing happen to my wife. - You know, I've been at this agency for 20 years. Seen a lot of heinous cases. And even I couldn't endure what she did on yesterday. - Any man would've done the same thing. - And you didn't think I could empathize with you? There's no amount of money that I would've taken to trade places with either of you. I just wish you would've consulted with me first. - Consulted? Lisa, I don't need your advice on how to save my family. You hear me? - Since you have all the answers, how do I account for this? - With all due respect, I'm not asking you to. - Jason, I can't fix this. - I don't need you to protect me. Okay? I take full accountability for my actions. That was my wife on that feed. My wife. Had to do what I had to do to save her. - So, that's it? That's your story? Jason? How is she? - Alive. (couple talks quietly) (cellphone buzzes) - Jason. - Hello, Jason. I trust that you and Savannah are safe and well. Well, I have to really hand it to you, Jason. This wasn't the outcome I anticipated. I didn't think you would compromise yourself in such a manner. But as I said, you are indeed predictable. - What more do you want from me, huh? Calling me while I'm at home with my wife. - You thought we'd broken up. This is just the beginning for you and I. We are in this for the long haul. Did you not think that you'd have to deal with the consequences of your actions? For the rest of your life, you're gonna be looking over your shoulder. And hers. And your children's too. Then there's the guilt that you'll have to live with over the fact that you let me go. Escorted me right out the door. You remember that, don't you Jason? I'm not sure that connects with "strive to do the right thing, no matter the personal cost," but... "what must be done, should be done." - Hey, I suggest you watch your back. You hear me? If you think for a second, you got me by the balls and I'm supposed to to live my life in a constant state of fear, of you? - Denial is a deadly sin. Jason... Did you ever wonder why I chose that particular restaurant? - The thought never crossed my mind. - It's where you celebrated the death of my father. I vividly remember the night.
