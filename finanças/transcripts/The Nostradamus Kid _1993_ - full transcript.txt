which I've been offered a room rent-free by rich patroness of ERT thinks I'm a poet all right she'll pull the wool out of her ass see my world seemed to be falling apart my best maid at school and my best mate at church didn't like me anymore I was prevented by court order from raping the girl I loved and reduced to having philosophical conversations in a strip joint with a cannibal on the sofa room and with some money mum got from selling her old car I put a down payment on a television set which in turn became the author of my doom and a tape recorder on which I practiced my Laurence Olivier imitation I went about discontent made glorious summer by this son of DOC all ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port I spent long nights on the lounge room floor chewing methedrine which we all did in those days while studying for exams and grinding my teeth which was the byproduct of the same drug later known as speed as never before to move forward it stand tall and move sideways and stand tall on the frontier of necessity in a twilight of desire to heed the command of Isaiah to go to the humble cockroach and seek his advice ask not what you can do for pretty girls now your own core is dead ask what pretty girls can do for you and how often and what in their view it's the ultimate cost sometimes in waking dreams there were certain events that came back into my mind from that fateful seventh day adventists camp in 1956 and furthermore in ezekiel 35 8 you see now will fill his mountains but his slain men and in thy heels and in high valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall and that's we received the word on the first day of the ninth month cripes it's right so that means okay the seventh-day Adventist will be wiped out on September the first in the mountain where they dwell the campground it will be a very of dry bones that's next Saturday no so time is short you must make a commitment now before the Lord come it's like a thief in the night with power and great glory and watch the destruction from across the road look I'll come back in the morning alright I'm gonna be bonkers and he's gotta be made theorists I write this under the

know what it is faster deeply man did you really stone that horse for five days yeah it was just a dramatic effect the week moved in eggs durably towards Saturday I felt very alone I kept a straight face through my remaining days on this troubled planet and tried to enjoy myself but the old pleasures didn't seem the same thou Lord who knoweth all things because thou wert a man thyself and did suffer even as we do something yay even a toothache probably Lord look down upon us with thy mercy what eighteen and sixth circuit's of them that don't sound much like since I'll tell you what you best keep Albert you give me the odd eighteenpence this would be on the stage yeah but being on the stage is a sin my father was a musical the flow is converted get away luck you saw the light few

all the women all of them what do you may not I'll hold him down what we want right two of them yeah yeah that's right on the last night of the world then our wonder fired act one last rage against the dying of the light was to change the laboratory signs around and write up some rude graffiti and go quite early to bed I tried to write up my diary for you know posterity what it was like to be one who knew the end had come but I soon dozed off and mum turned off the life no one died the next day or the next they took up the collection and that night I said well Esther at the pictures we are certain de Bruyne me a good seven go go ahead other blokes old bugger up me a said and a boy this man had two wives before God's light came into his life he had to choose which one to send away he said it made him sad but God's will must be done this is his second her name is mom to them all he knows did you do that for didn't show respect that's what I said I wouldn't do what sister white says

okay didn't happen didn't happen you you're all flaming mad you have this fantasy like I live in the real world see you next year okay bye don't take it out on me okay and so the two beautiful sisters walked away out of my life I wrote to Esther for the next two years and she wrote primly back to me and the next year at camp she sat with Allen Rawlins and the pictures a good clean Christian boy whose dad was also a minister and the next year she didn't come because she was in the loony bin for a while I watched her walk away and knew how much I had lost by taking her hand being a seventh-day adventists was hard but it was kind of fair they quickly sorted out the ones they couldn't trust like Meryl and me branded us with the Mark of Cain and sent us wandering fugitive sinners through the Land of Nod for all our days at dawn next day after his long all-night vigil the Shepherd's rod packed up his gear and drove south he drove to a green hill near cost Harbor one that he used to run on as a kid he walked for half a mile down long trodden paths towards the sea and on a rocky headland he used to pray on when he was a troubled kid like me he blew his head off he was a true believer you see he truly believed the next day the camp packed up and we all went home that afternoon I went to see Deb in Lismore Base Hospital doing his deathbed scene though he lived for 20 more years they've never missed an opportunity to be memorable an adequate definition of love and I found it yesterday when a reader's digest the nice brought to me and what could have been the last hour of me life it's

my triumph is bottom in our cut down high school version of Midsummer Night's Dream the long afternoons riding home of Whelan and McAlister talking about teachers and lard and girls my young people's meeting about the Shroud of Turin and how the resurrection was thereby proved with the aid of modern science I thought of the life ahead with Jenny and her Jaguar radiator driving west hopping blood getting married in Burke or Broken Hill it felt very good somehow I must have dozed off I remember the methedrine lights on the back of my eyelids when I woke up the car was stopped and Jenny was on the verge of crying what's happy that's King's College Parramatta Johnnie's there my brother why do you ring your father yes maybe once your father in the place yes let's go on I began to wonder if I was driving less with the wrong girl she was markedly different in her mood from how she was that afternoon in bed I thought of her submission to her father's desire to have me put in you Jo I thought of rich girls in general their fickleness and passion for transitory thrills could I this long night be like that now to her on the mountaintop at a scenic lookout with a handy view of the mushroom cloud over Sydney we made love I changed my mind I knew she loved me and we were destined for this moment you do it better than anyone else' sippy a couple sins are you angry I think it makes me more

It was as though we were tuned up for the end of the world and nothing else wouldn't do it all I'm not sure if it was the loss of his daughter or the loss of his Jagua that annoy data Brian the most there was a rough night overall are you playing fine I was first charged with kidnapping and then car theft and then driving without a license but Jenny said that was all wrong and in the end they let me go with extreme bad grace I rang up Jenny and asked if she'd marry me she said she think about it I never heard from her again I saw her across the room at the exams but then she got away and the next thing I heard she was on a world trip with her mother I started going to parties now there are other girls in the world what's about then just return as it was and a spirit shall return auntie
