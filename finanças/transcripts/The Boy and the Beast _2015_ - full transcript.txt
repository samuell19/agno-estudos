What a troublesome bunch you are. But if you really wanna know, we'll tell you. Take a seat there and listen up. A long time ago, but not really that long ago. This is about a little while ago. There are many cities in the world of beasts. As many as 100,000 beasts live in the remarkably busy Juutengai. The grandmaster who's been leading them for a long time, announced that he'd retire and reincarnate as a god. He didn't know what kind of god he wanted to become, but he allowed a successor to be chosen. He told everyone to prepare for this. Strength and dignity were obvious requirements. A beast called Iouzen made a name for himself right away. He's a great person who's calm, brave, and has lots of disciples. He's also the father of two children, Ichirouhiko and Jiroumaru. "He'll surely be the next grandmaster", is what everyone was saying. But there was another candidate. His name was Kumatetsu. As his name suggests, he looked like a bear, was swift like a monkey, possessed bottomless strength, and wielded his sword masterfully. When it came to strength, he was said to surpass even Iouzen. By the way, this guy was a bit troublesome. He was violent, selfish, disrespectful, didn't have a single disciple, let alone any children. Let's go. Don't touch me! You're minors, right? We aren't! You ran away from home, didn't you? Like I said, we didn't! Oh, indeed. A baby mouse? Still, you're so tiny. Just a sec. Here. Eat it. Did you run away from somewhere, too? I'm all alone, too. All right, let's take this. Okay. This one goes there. Dad, where are you? What are you doing? Why aren't you here at a time like this? Ren, it's time to go. Um, what about this? Ah, we'll take that ourselves. Oh... Ah, be careful. Ren, I know you're lonely after suddenly loosing your mum, but it can't be helped, it was an accident. The head family will take you in. All right? You're our family's only boy and precious successor. We'll raise you, so there's nothing to worry about. Ren, answer if you understand! Why didn't dad come? Forget about him. Why? He's my dad. Don't you already know that your mum divorced him? Plus, the courts gave us full custody of you. He's just an outsider now. I'll just live by myself then. Hmph, you're just a kid. You obviously can't do that. I'll live by myself. I'll become strong and get you all back for this! How can you talk like that?! Ren, you're- I hate you! You and dad... I hate all of you! Ren, wait! Ren! I hate you... I hate you... I hate you... I hate you... I hate you! I hate you. I hate... you... Chiko? I'm all right, thanks. Geez, what's with that? I just have to be stronger than Iouzen, right? Dignity? What does that even mean? The grandmaster is asking for a bit too much there. How long did it take for the previous one to run away? A month... A week? A day... He was gone by noon! I hate whiny people like that! Can you afford to be picky? At this rate, you'd be better off taking a random human or broom as your disciple. Is that so? Got it. Hey, I was just joking! Don't take it seriously! Hey! I said, hey! Are you alive or dead? Shut up. If you can talk, I guess that means you're alive. Where's your mum? Shut up. What about your dad? Shut up. Answer me! Where's your dad? Shut up! If you keep talking, I'll kill you! Who're you killing, brat? Let me see your face. A b... A beast... Not bad. That's enough, don't you think? You wanna come with me? Eh? Huh?! S-Stop saying stupid things, Kumatetsu! What was that? A dream? Hey you, did you run away from home? L-Let go! Children shouldn't be out in the dead of the night. Let go of me! What's your guardian's phone number? We'll have them pick you up. No... Let's go. Absolutely... not! Wait! Hey, wait! Stop! Hey! Where'd he go? Over there? No, this way! Is this really Shibuya? Huh? Huh? Huh?! Ow... Huh? They way I just came from is gone! The way out... Where's the way out? Let go! What's this? It's a human child. Why is it here? This is perfect, let's tear off his skin and sell it to the lute maker. Maybe we should dry him out and shave off bits for bonito flakes. Or... H-Help! Stop it, you idiots! Huh? Don't say wicked things like that. He's acting all high and mighty. Don't let it bother you. They just look and talk a bit rough, that's all. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm Hyakushuubou. As you can see, I'm a monk. You can't come to Juutengai unless you follow the exact route. We beasts who can even become gods, and you humans who can't, live in different worlds. Coming here by accident must have been scary. Come with me, I'll lead you back to your world. Yo! You actually came? Ah! I knew you had something in you! I'm starting to like you! Come here! What are you doing? He's a lost child, be gentle! Gentle? All you monks do is spout off such nonsense. I'm telling you to not be rough! What's wrong with being rough?! And he isn't lost. Starting now, he's my disciple! Disciple? I told you already. You forgot? You're taking a human child as your disciple?! It doesn't matter whether it's a human or a broom! A disciple is a disciple! Hold on! Didn't I tell you multiple times not to do it? Tatara, explain what's going on. The grandmaster told him he must have a disciple if he wants to be the successor. But unlike in Iouzen's case, no one wants to be his disciple. And just when we were sightseeing the pitiful humans, we found this brat. So you kidnapped him?! He followed us all by himself. That's no reason to get a stranger involved! Are you saying I can't set my sights on anyone I think's got potential?! Huh?! Hey! He's so unreasonable. Does he want to be the successor that badly? No, no. He only wants to win a fight against Iouzen. That's all. Indeed, becoming the grandmaster and reincarnating as a god doesn't seem to interest him. Even if he became a god, "god of tool" he'd probably be a tsukumogami at best. Maybe a toilet god, or a broom god. It's the human child I'm worried about. Do you think it'll be okay to leave him with Kumatetsu? Who knows. Not my problem. What do you mean by disciple? It means I'll be providing for you from now on. It's not like I asked you to. You sleep there. However, I hate whiny people. If you cry, I'll throw you out. I won't cry. That's the way! That doesn't mean I've agreed to become your disciple. Then why did you follow me? Why... Even if you don't answer, I can tell. You've got nowhere else to go. Are you pitying me? You idiot! You can only say that after you've become an adult! You'll have to keep living alone anyway. I don't know your name yet. I'm not telling you. Huh? It's personal information. Fine! And your age? "Kyuu" Nine... "ninth boy" All right, from now on, you're Kyuuta! Why do you get to give me a name? It's Kyuuta from now on, okay? Well then, I'm going to sleep, Kyuuta. Ren. I made your favourite ham omelette. Eat it before it gets cold. Okay. So he ran away. I knew this would happen... He must have really disliked his new name! It's time for breakfast! Stop it! Still angry? I was just messing around a little. Cheer up and eat. These are fresh eggs. Not eating them raw is a waste. Or are you not hungry? I am! Then eat! Raw eggs are...! Huh? They're gross, who'd eat them! Everyone does! Look, like this! See? That's just stupid. What was that?! I forbid my disciple to be a picky eater! I'm not your disciple! Shut up and eat! I won't! If you're hell-bent on not eating... What are you gonna do? I'll stuff them in your mouth! Stop it, Kumatetsu. Be kind. You get it now, don't you, Kumatetsu? Just send that brat back home. Huh? Where'd he go? I hate you! Wait right there! Kyuuta! Kyuuta? Hey! Who'd wanna become your disciple?! Wait, you! Where'd he go?! The way out... Where's the way out? Sorry to keep you waiting. Nii-chan, you want some? I see. I'll eat it all by myself then. I guess I'll start with the mandarin. Nope, changed my mind. I'll eat the cherry first. Look, Jiroumaru! It's father! Dad! Ichirouhiko, Jiroumaru, has your training been going well? Yes! Father, I'd love for you to train me as well. Of course, right away. Master. I'll make some time, so can you wait a little longer? Huh, again? Yes! I'm sorry. Kumatetsu! Oh, Iouzen. I heard you got yourself a disciple for the first time in a while. Yeah, but he ran off somewhere. Did you see him? He's a brat about this small. A child? Even though you're quite the child yourself? Tch, shut up. I'm saying this as the father of two children, being a parent will be difficult for you because of your lack of experience. Is that so?! I'm the type that doesn't change his mind once he's decided on something. Anyway, Kyuuta's really fast... These human kids... Human? Your disciple is a human child?! Master! It hurts! Let go! A human? Why is it in our world? That's a human? Why's a human here? Oh, Kyuuta! Hold on, Kumatetsu! I won't make fun of you, just put him back where you found him. What's the problem with a human or two? None of you probably know the real reason... why we beasts and humans live in separate worlds. While humans are weak, they can harbour darkness deep in their hearts. What if the darkness gets to him and we can't control him? Darkness? I didn't see such a thing in him. Listen, this problem doesn't concern only you! What happens to my disciple is my decision! I'm warning you, for the sake of everyone in Juutengai, stop it! For everyone's sake? You think you've already become the new grandmaster, Iouzen? What? Let's see if you can stop me by force. We can even decide the next successor right here. Iouzen and Kumatetsu are having a showdown! Finally! Clear the area! The new grandmaster is going to be decided? Gather around! This is great! Calm down, Kumatetsu! Nice, go get him! I'm betting on Iouzen! I'm betting on Iouzen, too! Me, too! We can't bet if everyone chooses the same guy! Well, well.. Father. Stand back. What's with Kumatetsu's attitude?! Don't you have any manners?! Are you making a fool of us?! Learn from Iouzen! Hey! Show some etiquette! He doesn't have any etiquette in the first place. That idiot has turned everyone against him. Are they going to have a sword fight? The grandmaster has prohibited the unsheathing of swords, Our swords have their hand-guards tied to the sheaths, so they can't be drawn. Is that... so?! Hey, wait! Where'd he go?! What's that idiot doing...? That's his way of provoking the enemy. Whoa, as expected of Iouzen! He's gonna do the same thing? He got him! Idiot! Damn! Whoops... We're not done yet! Father! Don't worry. Ready.... Go! Out of the way! Iouzen is being driven into a corner! Has the match been decided?! Iouzen, don't give up! Iouzen! No one... No one is cheering for him. He's... all alone. Iouzen! Damn! Had enough yet? I won't stop until I've beat you! Give it a rest already. What? We're not done yet! Iouzen! You can do it, Iouzen! Get him, Dad! Kumatetsu! Don't you lose! Who was that? There's someone who'd cheer for Kumatetsu? Who is it? Don't you lose! Kyuu- It's over! That's enough. Grandmaster. What are you doing? It's still too early for the match. I haven't yet decided what kind of god I want to become. Grandmaster, please punish Kumatetsu for bringing in a human. You say "punish", but you seem to have punished him plenty yourself. I don't care what anyone says, Kyuuta is my disciple! I see you're determined. Are you going to make an exception for him? It's unfortunate, but Kumatetsu can't take responsibility! I'll take responsibility. I'm the one who insisted on Kumatetsu taking a disciple, after all. But if he allows darkness into him... It's not like all humans are consumed by darkness. But...! Why are you always so easy on Kumatetsu? This conversation is over. Disperse! Kumatetsu, be grateful the grandmaster has such a kind heart. Damn! You're strong, aren't you? Weren't you watching? If I can really become strong by staying with you, then I don't mind becoming your disciple. You'll probably run away again. These haven't expired yet, right? D-Delicious... All right, Kyuuta! I'll train you thoroughly, prepare yourself! It suits you, Kyuuta. Quiet! Watch carefully. Splendid, splendid! Got it? If you got it, do it! Do it...? Kyuuta, do your best. Ow! Stop. Stop it! Where should I make improvements? "Improvements", he says! You're making me laugh! It can't be helped, it's my first time! "First time!" "My first time!" Enough, shut up! Simply saying "do it" isn't enough. Explain properly from the beginning. Explain? Isn't that the master's duty? All right then. First, hold your sword like oomph. Then do whoosh and bam! Okay? That's it? Like I said, hold it like oomph, then do whoosh and woom! Okay? Oomph? Like I said, oomph! Oomph... No, no, no! It's uumph. Uumph! No, no, no, no! It's wuumph! Wuumph! No, no, no, no, no! Gyuumph! Gyoomph! G-Gyoomph! No, no, no, no! It's all wrong! Man, you really catch on slowly! No wonder I can't do it! What?! How do you expect me to do it with that kind of teaching?! Stop complaining and just do it! No. Do it! No. Damn...! Kyuuta is a beginner, explain it simpler. Yeah, I got it! I'll explain it even more detailed then! Grasp the sword in your heart! You have one in your heart, don't you?! Huh? How could I have such a thing? The sword in your heart is important! It's right here! Right here! Do it if you understand! Do it! Where are you going? What's up with him? All he does is yell... Kumatetsu! Wait, Kumatetsu! How can there be a sword in my heart, idiot. You should go back home. Huh? A disciple usually needs five to ten years of training. You won't make it if you take it so lightly. If you're just looking for free food, go bother someone else in the human world. This isn't the place for you. If you understand, make yourself scarce! Where's he? Not sure. He said he'd be gone for 2-3 days. Can you tell me what a disciple is supposed to do? First would be cleaning, laundry, and cooking. What's with the sudden change? Is it about yesterday? Not really. Forget about it. He may get mad quickly, but it's all forgotten by the next day. It's not something you should be worried about. Like I said, that's not it. They'll get wrinkled like that, stretch them out a bit. Okay. I've never had a human customer before. Is that so? How long are you gonna be around? I don't know. How unsocial. Geez, these humans... Damn human! Damn monster! I heard my father talk about it. Sooner or later, humans become uncontrollable. I'll exterminate you while I still can! Stop it, Jiroumaru! Nii-chan. How could someone so weak become a monster? Next time my brother bullies you, call me. I'll scold him. You're dead if you rat me out! Enough, Jiroumaru! Seeing weak people makes me angry. Hey, my brother is really strong! Like a hermit, he can move things without touching them! Come on, show him, too! No! Doesn't father always say that strength isn't for showing off, but for kindness?! I may still be a child, but I'll train hard... and one day become a great swordsman with a long nose and big tusks like father. Me, too! I'll become a cool swordsman like dad, too! Let's go. Yeah! "Someone so weak", huh... Damn! The hell?! Who did this?! It was your disciple. Don't do unnecessary things! Huh? What's with those bruises? Pitiful. Geez, aren't you ashamed of being beat up? Indeed, I'm pitiful and weak. It's as you say. As long as you understand. Then let me be blunt. What about you? Huh? He wakes up early, you sleep till noon. He's busy, you have time to spare. Even though you have time, you're not doing anything. Are you talking about Iouzen? Even though he's busy, he's polite. Even though you have time, you're short-tempered. What are you trying to say? I totally get why you couldn't defeat him! What was that?! Say it again, I dare you! I'll say it as many times as I have to! You're the worst! Calm down, you two! How dare you talk like that to your master?! If you're a master, then act like one! What?! The smallest things make you mad! Hey! You give up quickly! It's fine that you have the guts to express your opinion, but a disciple should just shut up and listen! In your dreams! If I listen to you, I'll become stupid! Stay still, you! Shut up, idiot! Forgive him, Kyuuta. This is just how he is, please understand. Ah, Kumatetsu, let's go outside! This is just how he is, please understand. This is just how he is, please understand. Stop! Outside! Let go! Let go! Damn, damn, damn! I'm the trying the best I can! Yet what's up with that kid?! You've had enough, right? Just kick him out already. Besides, I don't have spare time! I chop wood, catch fish and pick tea to earn a living! His share, too! Just stop, you've done enough. So how could he say those things?! Right?! I couldn't agree more. You were living alone before, so you should know. Living alone is awesome! No responsibilities, no annoyances! You don't even have to have a full stomach! Uh...! Oops, shouldn't have said that one. Practising till late at night is commendable, Kumatetsu. Grandmaster! Letting your disciple see how hard you work should serve as a good lesson. Uh, yeah, that's what I was thinking... Very well. These shall be your reward. What are those? Letters of introduction. Letters of introduction? Take your disciple and travel around the country. You can meet the other grandmasters in no time with these. B-But... These famous sages can give you clues about what real strength is. But... Well then, have a nice trip! It was a good chance to ditch the brat. But since this comes from the grandmaster, you can't refuse. Too slow! Too slow! Too slow! Damn! At least eat your food slowly... Excuse us for asking. What is strength? My arms aren't very strong, but look, I can create illusions. Don't make light of it! Illusions can sometimes be more real than reality itself. That is... That is...? ...strength. What is strength? Why do you seek something like that? I possess some telekinetic powers, but no matter how strong I am, there are things I can't win against. That is... That is...? Can I ask you for something? Could you please massage my back? Telekinesis doesn't work on back pain. Ow, ow, ow... Strength? You're asking the wrong person. Whether it's rainy or windy, I simply sit here like a stone. Why? To forget time, the world and myself in order to transcend reality. That is... That is...? She turned into stone. Strength? I'm not one to philosophise. I catch my prey faster than anyone else. The one who gets to taste everything in this world wins. If you like something, don't hold back. That is... That is...? An opening! Don't worry, I don't eat guests. See? If you listen to that nonsense, you'll lose your way. I was almost eaten alive! Strength seems to have many meanings. They all said interesting things. If you liked it so much, why don't you just study quietly sitting at a desk? At least learning like that would be worthwhile! Unlike a certain someone's oomph and gyoomph! You have to figure it out yourself! Just because you can't explain! It's because you're a slow learner! It's because you're bad at teaching! What a slow-learning disciple! When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless... What a slow-learning disciple! What was that?! When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless... When it comes to arguing, your stamina is endless... Give it a rest, I'm tired! Can't sleep? Do I lack talent? Are you worried about it? He calls me a slow learner. I don't agree with that. Be it laundry or cleaning, at first you knew nothing about it, but with little teaching you got the hang of it quickly. Those who work sincerely learn fast. But... The problem lies with Kumatetsu. Look at his techniques, they're a mess. In other words, he created them. But why? He has no parents and no master. He became strong all by himself. He became stronger. That is his talent and also his misfortune. If you never listen to anyone, you can't give proper advice. I see. But sometimes, he says "Oh, I see." Do you get it? "You have to figure it out yourself." Exactly, I believe that's his principle. I don't know a better way to teach. To think the peerless Kumatetsu-sama... would fuss over that cheeky brat so much. I-It's not like that! Well, you weren't any better when you were little. Even though you were weak, you sure were noisy. Only because I didn't have a master! The grandmaster was the only one who'd put up with you. Because you were troublesome and would never listen, you'd get beat up over the smallest things. Damn, just remembering them pisses me off! Indeed. He's just like you right now. Well, I'd prefer it if he were gone as soon as possible. But if you're going to continue being his master, remember what you really wanted when you were a brat. Well then, good night. "You have to figure it out yourself", huh? I don't get it... That was you just now. Huh? No good? Become him. Huh? Was that you just now? Become him... Become him. What am I doing...? I should at least learn the footwork. Ow, ow, ow... What was that? What are you doing? Become him. What are you two doing? Are you making a fool of me?! I'm not! Then what are you doing?! None of your business! You're annoying! Huh? Where did he run off to? What's up with that?! He's like a duck following its parent. I'm not a duck! Isn't it normal for a child to imitate his parent? I'm not his parent. Kyuuta intends to learn from you from scratch. Like a baby following his parent. A baby? Kumatetsu doesn't seem dissatisfied. No parent would be unhappy about his child trying to become like him. Hey brat, how long are you going to continue this farce? If imitating someone could make you stronger, there'd be no hardships! Hey, don't distract us! Huh? Weren't you really annoyed by it? It's fine, just go away! Hey, hey... What's up with him? I don't know. Maybe he's warmed up to his sincere disciple. No way... Seriously?! Here! All right, I get it! Then how about this?! Perfect! No, time out! No time outs! Wait, give that back! Nope! Huh? Even though I'm not looking, I know. I know! Damn! Should I try it out? Ow! Ow, ow, ow... What's wrong, Kyuuta? Ow, ow, ow... What's wrong, Kyuuta? What are you doing?! Stop, stop! Huh? What's happening? Kyuuta, you... I kept observing his footwork, suddenly I could tell what he'd do next. What?! Stop joking! That's amazing, Kyuuta! You just made me admire you for the first time! Kumatetsu, you better learn from Kyuuta. Learn from him?! Why would I?! I don't mind teaching you. Huh?! In return... Huh?! I have no idea how to hold a sword or throw a punch, so please teach me! Ow! Damn, explain it in more detail! Ow! Observe your opponent and become one with him. Ow! Become one! That's what Kumatetsu gets for never paying attention to anyone but himself. Understanding his enemy is the thing he's worst at. That's the drawback of becoming strong all by yourself. Ow! Become one with your opponent! That's what I'm doing! You can't do it at all! Acting all high and mighty, you...! Explain it in more detail. Damn! Don't get full of yourself! I'm betting on Jiroumaru. Me as well. Me, too. Take this! You're amazing! I like strong people! Come over to my place next time! We have lots of tasty sweets! So come over, 'kay? I did it! Damn! Just take your time when you're eating... I win! You do the dishes! Damn! You've grown quite a bit. You think so, Hyaku-san? Eh? Tata-san? When did this happen... Seriously? His form is decent. It seems so. For a human, his progress is astonishing. Haven't you noticed? Huh? The one who progressed the most is Kumatetsu. His movements are refined and sharp. Indeed. You can't tell which one's the master. Kyuuta, how old are you now? "17th boy" I see, then you're Jyuunanata from now on. Kyuuta is fine. Master Kumatetsu! Please take me as your disciple! I'd like to become strong like Kyuuta-san! All right, nice determination. Thank you very much! Well then, go line up. Eh?! Wait at the end of the line until you're called! They're all still green behind the ears and don't seem to have what it takes. Hm? I decide what I practice! No, I do! Kyuuta's already an adult, treat him like one. He is? He doesn't even have any fur! I do have fur! Where?! Now, now... I win! See ya! Wait! I'm not done talking! You do the dishes! Wait, damnit! Hey Kyuuta, let's go to our place! Later! I told you to wait! Kyuuta really is something. Thanks to him, Kumatetsu has improved a lot. Dad said that our unit can't let its guard down. Kumatetsu? Don't compare such a blockhead with father. Huh? What's wrong, Nii-chan? It's nothing. Whoops! Where'd he go?! Geez, he's really stubborn. Huh? This is... The important thing is... only so... because... you keep it close... That is so... because... you had it... for a long time... Say... how do you read this? "Whale". Oh, so it's "whale". I told you so! Dunno what you mean! Shut up already! Hello? They hung up! Who was it? No idea. What is it? If you're gonna be noisy, do it outside. Can I do whatever I want outside? That's up to you. Let's go. She wouldn't shut up since first class, so everyone ignores her. Huh... So we can do whatever we want? Hey, don't run away! Stop it! I can do whatever I want outside, right?! We're not bothering anyone after all! Don't move... Oh, you saw that? Ah, you see, there was some trouble. You didn't see anything, did you?! Huh?! You piece of shit! What's with that look? What's up with his clothes? They're lame! So lame! Let's go. Yeah. It's a lie that everyone gets along in a new school. Violence is bad. However, thank you for saving me. I didn't really save you. You did save me. Say, how do you read this? I don't know anything. I haven't been to school since primary school. Really? In that case, I'll teach you all the characters in that book. Really? Yes. I'm Kaede. It's written with the characters "tree" and "wind", "Kaede". I'm... Ren. The characters for Ren are... "Tsuranaru" with a "grass" radical. Right... Ren-kun. "Break on through the- Kyuuta! Kyuuta! Shut up! Too slow! Don't yell! Kyuuta! He's long gone. He seems busy lately. Busy with what?! The protagonist wants revenge on the whale who took his leg. But the protagonist is actually fighting against himself. Against himself? It means the whale is a reflection of himself. Reflection... Your concentration is incredible. At this rate, you should be able to solve the problems in the reference book in no time. It's because you're a good teacher. Really? I have a bossy master, so I can tell. By master, do you mean the kendo master who raised you? He's useless. You must be close. No way, we always fight. Sounds nice, I'm jealous. Why? I don't ever fight with my parents. Huh? I'm here for the happiness of my parents. Since kindergarten, I desperately tried to get the grades my parents wanted. Yet they don't know how I feel. They don't even notice. But I know. Unless I find out who I am by myself, it won't be really me. So even though it's difficult right now, I study hard. Once I graduate and make it into a university, I'll move out. After that, I'll study only for myself. Graduate out of my own strength. And then, live my own life. I've never told this to anyone before. I feel relieved. Kaede... Hey, about that book... There are limits to what I can teach. I'm sure there are even better teachers. Where? Ren-kun, would you like to go to university? That's... I'll help you with the entrance exams! But me going to university... Don't you want to know more about the things you don't know? I do. "Kounin" is the certificate people who're at high school graduate level can get. It used to be called "daiken", it's a university entrance test for people who didn't graduate from high school. It's impossible. Huh? I don't know your proficiency, but if you've been a shut-in till you're this old, how about starting with evening middle school? Ah, but... Life isn't that easy. Even if you were accepted, without a guardian, what about the tuition payments? Even scholarships are hard to get nowadays. But... I totally get it! I knew university would be impossible for me... I apologise for that! Feel free to consult me. There are quite a few universities with scholarship systems. You can also arrange a corporate scholarship which you don't need to pay back. Dependant on your grades, of course. Thank you very much! Thank you very much. Math and science are compulsory. I haven't studied them at all. Leave it to me, I'll teach you everything! We need a certificate of residence for the Kounin test. It seems your former certificate has been erased. I knew it... But since there are still records of your family register, we can register a new certificate of residence. Is your father's current address correct? Please verify it. The father you were separated from? I had no idea where he was. But to find him this easily... Are you going to meet him? I might be a bother if I suddenly went there. He might have forgotten about me. But... But... What should I write... Dad, throw the ball! Here! Sir, you forgot something. Really, how careless of me. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Um... Yes? Do you... remember... me? I knew it... I'm sorry. Ren? Are you Ren? You've grown so much, how could I tell?! Where were you till now?! Oh, um, I was with people who were taking care of me, and... I'm glad you're all right... I'm sorry... I couldn't do anything for you all this time... Dad... I see. I'm happy for you. It turns out dad didn't find out about mum until a lot later. He kept looking for me. Even after the police gave up, he still continued. I see. Kaede! Say, is that your boyfriend? He's not! Then who's he? Which school is he from? Go away! Sorry. I wonder if I can also live an ordinary life now. Ordinary? Live with my parents like an ordinary person. Study and work like an ordinary person. Come home and sleep like an ordinary person. Maybe I can live like that, too. Are you hesitating? Is it because of your master? Where have you been? I want to talk about something, listen seriously. How is your training? Listen, the thing is... You think you can neglect it? Listen to him, Kumatetsu. And what's this? I found it in your bed. Explain. I want to go to a human school. Huh?! I want to know more about the other world, so... Aren't there more important things you should do? Didn't you want to become strong? I've become strong. Huh?! Don't make me laugh! Kumatetsu. I've become plenty strong. What part of you is strong, huh?! Talking with you always ends up like this... You ignore what I say and act selfish. Tell me, when did you become strong?! That's enough. Wait! Where are you off to? There's one more thing. I found my father, I'm going there. That's what I just decided. Wait, wait! Don't go! Step aside. I won't let you go! Don't go! Kyuuta! Kyuuta! Were you able to resolve things? I guess not... Doesn't matter anymore. I'm going to meet my dad now, and everything will be fine. Aren't you overdoing it? Why would I? I'll be at the library today. Come to me if anything happens. Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! I'm sorry! Shouldn't you get it if you're a quick learner? I'm sorry! Don't apologise for everything! I'm sorry! Enough! Each and every one of them... To find his father after all this time... Does he really not intend to come back? Why would he come back? Yeah... Without Kyuuta, Kumatetsu will regress to his former useless self. No, he's already- Shut up! What are you doing?! That's dangerous! He saw himself as Kyuuta's foster parent. He did? Damn! Ren! Tonight's dinner is ham omelette! Let's prepare it and eat together. By the way, could you tell me more about the person who's taken care of you till now? Huh? I have to visit him and thank him properly. After that, we can live together. Wait a moment. Isn't that obvious? It just seems a bit sudden... I see... I... Right... Time flows different for adults and children. The time I spent with you and your mother feels like yesterday to me. Yesterday? Sorry for rushing things. Let's slowly start over. We'll forget all the painful things... and live facing forward from now on. Start over what? Why do you decide that it's just painful? What do you even know about me?! Ren... You don't know anything, so don't act like you do! Ren, I... Of course you don't know... I haven't told you anything... Sorry, I won't come over today. And your meal? No, thanks. Ren, I don't mind if you decide what we do from now on! But don't forget! I'll do whatever I can! So... Ren! What's going on with me? Why did I say those things to dad? Don't go! Damn, why am I remembering him? Let's start over. Damn. Don't go! Damn! I don't get it! That's... I hate you. I hate... you... The old me? A hole? It disappeared! Ren-kun? You have a really scary look, like you aren't yourself. Please tell me, what am I? Am I a human, or am I a beast? A beast? Or... am I an ugly monster? What are saying? Come on, tell me, what am I? Ren-kun, you're not yourself. Just what... am I?! I too am sometimes in so much pain that I don't know what to do. No matter what I do, it feels like something's going to burst in my chest. It's not just you. It's not just me. I'm sure it happens to everyone. That's why you'll be fine. That's why... you'll be fine! Thank you. I've calmed down. I'm myself again. Wait. I've liked this bookmark since I was little. It has helped me many times. If you're ever uncertain of yourself or have feelings like before, remember... this charm. Huh? What's going on? Kyuuta! Let's go to my place. The grandmaster has suddenly decided on a day, so the city is in an uproar. Decided on a day? Take your time. Thank you, Mum. The match between my dad and your master is tomorrow. The match to decide the new grandmaster. You didn't know? We kinda had a fight. It got awkward so I kept my distance. I see. We haven't seen dad around lately, either. He's been busy training. I miss him, but it can't be helped. You don't want your master to lose either, right? So just forget about that awkward stuff and cheer him on. Yeah. Regardless of the outcome, we remain friends. Of course. I hope it's a good match. Yeah. Jiroumaru! Nii-chan! Kyuuta might be troubled if you keep him occupied for too long. You hear that? Even the cicadas started chirping. I'll walk him to the entrance. Thanks. Well then... What... good match?! The outcome... is already... obvious! A human like you... A blockhead... like Kumatetsu... Know your places as the blockheads you are! Ichirouhiko... Why does he have the same thing...? Why...? Which one are you rooting for? I'm not sure. I'm betting on Iouzen. I'm betting on Kumatetsu. I... How worrying! I've been worrying. For the past nine years, I've been worrying, worrying, worrying. And I have finally reached a decision. So, what kind of god are you going to become? Definitely the god of decisiveness! The reincarnation ritual will be held after the match. Enjoy it. The match to select the next grandmaster will now commence! The candidates shall step forward! Woah! There's a huge difference in the expressions of your disciples! If only Kyuuta were here. Kumatetsu, don't look so gloomy, the match is about to begin! Be quiet! In accordance to the rules, the swords shall remain sheathed. Unsheathing them won't be forgiven! Running away results in a loss. Remaining down by the count of ten results in a loss. We shall bear witness to the compliance of these rules. Candidates, prepare! Begin! Out of nowhere?! Kumatetsu is pushing him back. Even though he lacks stamina! Dad! Shut up and keep watching! See?! Damn! As expected of father! This is bad... He keeps getting hit... This is... Has it been decided? Are you finished already, Kumatetsu?! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Damn! Six! Seven! Eight! Kyuuta! N- It's Kyuuta! He's Kumatetsu's best disciple. He is? Kyuuta... Please Kyuuta, cheer Kumatetsu on! What are you doing, you dumbass?! Stand up already! Didn't you leave? How dare you show your face now? And what's with your stupid shape?! What did you say?! Pathetic! This isn't the time to be swearing at each other! Pathetic! What?! This isn't the time to be swearing at each other! You look miserable! This isn't the time to be swearing at each other! Gimme a break! You look miserable! Why does it always turn out like this?! You look miserable! Why does it always turn out like this?! Stop being depressed! Get up by yourself already! Even without you butting in, I won't lose! What?! He intends to continue? This just got interesting. One to the right! Dodge! Counter! You almost have him! Look, he's laughing. It's the face he makes when he trains with Kyuuta. Are you saying, even though he's in the middle of a match... His spirit has transcended beyond the enemy in front of him! He is in a state of perfect concentration. Kumatetsu alone can't win. But I can't tell the outcome when they're together! Dad, hang in there! Ahh, he'll lose! Shut up! N-Nii-chan? Kyuuta...! That bastard, even though he's just a human...! Don't get pushed back! Push back instead! Use your ridiculous strength! Now! What?! Right there! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! The winner has been decided! It's Kumatetsu! Don't make me worry. I didn't ask you to. I'm glad you could win. Of course I'd win. Stop joking, you barely made it. Shut up. It's the birth of a new grandmaster! Banzai! Banzai! He's got a good son. Huh? Let's go. The sword is... gone? What is this red stuff? Huh, Kyuuta? What's going on? Father, the match was decided with my telekinesis and your sword! It's your win! There's no way you'd lose to that blockhead, after all! Isn't that right, Kyuuta? Isn't that right?! Stop, Ichirouhiko! Father, I'm going to finish him off now. Please watch me. Did you see that, Kyuuta?! Serves you right! Do you get it?! My father, Iouzen, is the winner! You idiot, you think I'd accept something like this?! Wh-What's that?! A hole? You can't, Kyuuta! How dare you... How dare you... Kyuuta, reject the darkness! Nii-chan! Please stop, Kyuuta! What a disaster! Kyuuta... you... Ichirouhiko is being consumed by the darkness! I won't forgive you... Nii-chan, where are you? Nii-chan! Hey... why are you sleeping...? Wake... up... Kyuuta. Kyuuta! Too slow! Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow! What are you doing?! It's time for training! Chiko... What is it, Chiko? I'm sorry... Ichirouhiko, I'm sorry... Ichirouhiko's telekinesis is by no means the ability of a beast. It is clearly a power that stems from the darkness within a human heart. Grandmaster, you already knew? Iouzen, tell me your reason. His real parents must have had quite the circumstances. I decided to hide it from everyone and raise him secretly. I knew that humans can harbour darkness in their hearts, but I thought it'd be fine if I raise him myself. Thinking back, I realise how conceited that was. It was my own arrogance. Why don't I have tusks like you? Don't worry, I'm sure they'll grow one day. Why isn't my nose long like yours? Don't worry, with time... Father, just what am I...? Ichirouhiko, you're none other than my son. You're the son of Iouzen. The more he believed he was the son of a beast, the more insecure Ichirouhiko became. That's how the darkness in him was born. To think our world's ambiance caused the hole in a humans heart to grow to this extent... What's this darkness? I'm stupid, so I don't get it. It doesn't matter where my brother came from. To me, he's just my brother! Jiroumaru! Grandmaster, will we be unable to live with Ichirouhiko anymore? Won't we be able to start things over? Ichirouhiko is roaming around somewhere as we speak. As long as the darkness isn't expelled, there's nothing we can do. Kyuuta. You shouldn't get involved in this. You idiot! Do you want revenge?! What good will that do?! H-Hey, Hyakushuubou? I can't hold it in anymore! You're gravely mistaken if you think I'll be lenient like usual! Don't you understand after seeing Kumatetsu in that state, you fool?! You're still going? I appreciate your scolding. Thanks to you, I can stand proud. However, it's not revenge I want. Ichirouhiko and I are the same. There's no doubt I could have ended up like him, too. It's thanks to the people who raised me that I didn't. It's thanks to Tata-san, Hyaku-san, and everyone else. Kyuuta, you... That doesn't mean I can act as if this doesn't concern me. Ichirouhiko's problem is also my problem. That's why... I'm going. Please take care of Kumatetsu. That was splendid! I totally get your determination! Leave Kumatetsu to us! I won't take my eyes off him! So you can go! Go! "It's thanks to the people who raised me", huh? For us to be included... Well, we have been with him since he was little. Yeah. He was an impertinent, unpleasant brat at first. Whether it's been rainy or windy, we've been visiting him every day. Even though we were looking after him, he'd never say a word of thanks. And he's grown up before we even knew it. He's still cheeky, though. I'm so proud. Me, too. Kumatetsu! Ren-kun. I want to give this to you. Why? What for? There's an opponent I have to settle things with. I don't know if I can win. If I lose, everything might be over. That's why... No way... I'm glad I got to know you. Thanks to you, I got to learn a lot of new things. You made me think, "the world is really big". What are you saying? We still... Studying together made me really happy. That's why I wanted to thank you. Wait... I don't want that! That's not what I want... Kyuuta...! I won't forgive you. Even though you're just a human... Here of all places?! What's that? It's dangerous, run away. What are you doing?! Go quickly! No! I won't let go! Damn! Run as fast as you can! Stay away! What's going on? Are they filming a movie? Ren-kun! Damn, we can't fight here. I need to find a better place. Whale...? It's dangerous, don't go that way! Run away quickly! What's this? A shadow? What's that? A whale...? Get out of your cars! Just do it! Huh, what?! Run away! Run away quickly! Run! Kaede! How can I defeat him...? This way! Where are we going?! How should I handle this? If I open up my empty heart, lock up all his darkness in there, and stab myself, will it disappear with me? Is that the only option I have left? You see, I've been thinking about this since before. Why did I grab your hand and run with you? I was really scared, so why? Then I remembered. Around the time I first met you and we studied together, I was really happy. Because there's no one else who enjoys studying so much! Being with you encouraged me to do my best, too. And I still feel the same. If you're going to fight, I'll come with you. Don't forget. We never fight alone. Kaede... To all passengers. Due to a fire at the Shibuya station, we must ask you to... What are these tremors? Ichirouhiko is targeting Kyuuta... and running wild in the human city. Our worlds may be connected, but for us to be affected this much... Why must we be involved in a dispute between humans? It was wrong to drag humans into our world in the first place. Hey Kumatetsu, don't push yourself or you'll die! You're in no condition to move around! Shut up! I've heard what's going on. I'll do something about it. I will... Kumatetsu... What can you do?! Grandmaster, you're the only one... The only one who can do something about this. But you're keeping the method to yourself! Method? What method is there? Kyuuta may think he can stand on his own, but he still needs someone to look out for him. I might be a blockhead, but I want to support him. What he lacks in his heart, I'll fill up. That's the one thing even a blockhead like me can do! If you're saying something like this, that means... He's saying he wants me to hand over my right to reincarnate. He wants to reincarnate as a god? Ridiculous! That's not something ordinary beasts can do! Only a grandmaster can do it! Right now... Kumatetsu is the grandmaster. Listen well, Kumatetsu. Once done, there's no turning back. Do you still want to? Yeah... You really are something... There's not a glimpse of hesitation in your eyes. Ichirouhiko. He disappeared? Damn! Look out! Run away, Kaede. He's after me. Kaede! What is it you want? To cut the opponent you detest into pieces?! Will you feel satisfaction from crushing him under your feet?! You may have taken that form, but you're just a human obsessed with revenge! Everyone has a some darkness in him! Ren-kun does, too! Me, too! Even now, I'm struggling against it with all my strength. That's why there's no way Ren-kun would lose to you, who easily let himself be consumed by his darkness. There's no way we'll lose! Kaede! Ren-kun! I have no other choice. Ichirouhiko, look! I'll take in all your darkness! Ren-kun, could it be... Disappear along with me! Ren-kun! You can't lose! Kyuuta! What is this? Kyuuta, that's Kumatetsu! "god of tool" He reincarnated as a tsukumogami... and took on the shape of that sword! This is... him? That idiot said he wants to become the sword in your heart! The sword in my heart? You have one in your heart, don't you?! Huh? How could I have such a thing? The sword in your heart is important! It's right here! Right here! I knew you had something in you! I'm starting to like you! All right, from now on, you're Kyuuta! All right, Kyuuta! I'll train you thoroughly, prepare yourself! Kyuuta! What are you crying for, you idiot? I hate whiny people! Shut up, I'm not crying! Gather your energy! Kyuuta. Ren-kun. Not yet! Hone it even further! What's that? Ichirouhiko appears for an instant before every leap. In that case... Choose one point to attack. Aim for it without hesitation! Now! Go! Did he finish it? No. Even though... you're just a human... Ichirouhiko. We're the same. We were raised by beasts. We're the children of beasts. Where... ...am I? Father, Mother, Jiroumaru. What was I doing till now...? I remember going to the match with everyone... This is Kyuuta's... Do you understand, Kyuuta? I'm the type that doesn't change his mind once he's decided on something. I know. If you hesitate, I'll kick your ass from inside your heart! Shut up, I won't hesitate. That's the way. You just shut up and watch what I do. Show me then. Last night, in Tokyo Shibuya, a driver-less truck caused an accident leading to a big explosion. During the evacuation, several people were injured, but the injuries were only minor. According to the police, right before the accident, many witnesses reported seeing a whale-shaped shadow, but the security cameras didn't show anything of the like. Take a good look. Even Kyuuta was once just a weak child. In other words, if you keep up your daily training, you'll one day be able to stand on your own. Probably. I missed my chance to reincarnate as a god because of Kumatetsu. I have to go back to being the grandmaster... Now, now. Today we celebrate for Kyuuta. Cheers! What? Oh, look at that! That girl is yet another one of those who support Kyuuta. Kaede, what are you doing here? I've been invited. Ah, I had dropped this on the street. Finding it was difficult. Here, I'm returning it. Thanks. And there's also the application for the entrance test. Do you still feel like taking it? You have to make the decision yourself. I'll take it. Yes! That what I thought! Let's do our best together! I'm starting with the fireworks! Hey! After that, Kyuuta left Juutengai and never held a sword again. But there's no better swordsman. Yeah, he has a sword named Kumatetsu in his heart. He's a unique swordsman. No matter how hard it may become for him from now on, he'll definitely get through it.
