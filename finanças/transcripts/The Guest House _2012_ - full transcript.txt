♪ Look... You know this is for the best. I love you... But I want to enjoy my college experience. I'll be away from my parents for the first time, and I'll be making new friends. And I'll have the opportunity to grow as a person. And you can do the same thing. Hey, baby doll, we had a good run. We were together most of senior year and most of the summer. Don't be sad... Just focus on the good times we had. There she is... There's my little angel face. You know that I never wanted to hurt you. Owww! Fucking asshole! You're a selfish asshole! You couldn't have done this nine hours ago before you fucked me with that little dick of yours? Little? - Really?! - Yeah. You just think that because you're a whore! And you're a little bitch. I am not! - You're a crazy bitch! - Damn right... Crazy bitch with your cell phone. Oh, look who decided to come home. Good, won't have to write you a note. What's the big deal? You know I was out with Jason. You're always out with Jason. Frankly, I think you spend a little too much time with Jason. I don't like you staying out all night. Come on dad, I'm 18. I don't care! This is my house, my rules! Guess it's good I'm gone in a week then. I guess so. So you'll be, uh... in at nine from here on out. Nine? You can't be serious. Don't test me, Rachel. - I'm not trying to. - That's it! You're grounded! Grounded? I'm an adult! I mean it! And no, Jason may not come over. Don't worry. We broke up. Glad to see you finally dumped that little shit. You were too good for him. You'd have had better grades if it weren't for Jason. I graduated near the top of my class. You would have been at the very top. You could have been the best. What if I just want to be happy? Don't you see... I just want the best for you. If your mother were alive she'd want the same thing. I think she'd just want me to be happy. I don't have time for debate. No going out and no boys allowed. I'll talk to you on Tuesday when I get back. What if I need groceries or to go to the drug store? You can't keep me prisoner. I love you, Rachel. I want this to end on a good note, so yes... you can take some time, go run some errands, but during the daylight. At sunset I want you back here, or else. Anything else, commandant? Yes. I have a new employee starting at the company next week and she's going be staying at the guest house, until she gets settled. So please, try and be helpful. And, uh, you might want to think about a makeover before school starts. You look like you've been begging quarters on Melrose. ♪ ♪ Hi... I'm Amy. Mr. Richmond said I'm supposed to stay in the guest house. Yeah, he mentioned somebody was coming. I'm his daughter, Rachel. Oh, I'm sorry, come in. Thanks. Wow, this place is nice. Yeah, thanks, but I think it's too big for me and my dad. I keep telling him to get a condo somewhere. Well, it would definitely cut down on the yard work. If he did yard work. I guess you don't really like it that much here, huh? I just feel like it puts a bigger footprint on the world than necessary. Water? Thanks. Follow me. ♪ Wow, a jacuzzi. Nice. Yeah, and it's totally private. If you ever want to go tubbing some time, the neighbors can't see you. Good to know. But the gardner might be checking you out. ♪ Well, here it is. Wow... This is great. Do you play? Um, here and there. I can't play at all, so I'm envious of anyone who can. Well, since I'm such a good hostess... Are you kidding? Play me something. Seriously. Okay, um... That was really great. I've never heard it before. Just something I'm working on. Well, can you play me more? Hmm... Maybe when it's finished. I'd like that. You know, this house is really great. It's so beautiful. Yeah, it was my mother's art studio. But after she died my dad renovated it, due to property value. So, what happened to her? The big C. Um... Back in March she was all happy and lots of plans... But in April she was diagnosed and they started treating her immediately And she was all ready to fight... but then in June, she was gone. I'm really sorry. Anyways, um... This is my first attempt at interior design. Well, it's very chic. You have a talent for it. Really? Yeah... It's cozy, you know. Cozy's good. I'll take that. Uh, let me show you around. - Living room... - Yeah. Kitchen. And through here, this will be... your bedroom. So, you got the bed, and if you go right around the corner you're gonna have the tub, the shower or whatever, You know how to use that. So I'll leave you here, you can get settled, and if you need anything, I'll be in the house. Okay. Thank you. Uh-huh. Bye. Okay, I'll have ice cream! How about ice cream on top of pie? Yeeeaah! Okay. I like pumpkin pie. Okay, deal. Give me five! Right on. - Give me five. - I get the first slice. Nope, I get the first one. I get the second one. No, I get the first. No, no, no. I want you guys to guess what's in the boxes. You have to shake it. Don't shake it too hard. Whoever gets to guess it, gets to open first Umm... candy! Money? Rocks. Where is my wife and child? Hi, Daddy! Hey, Mister. Do you love your girls? Who loves her daddy? Oh, shit! Oh, my God! It's about time, you fucking dick! He's really hurt, you asshole! That's good. Don't you think he deserved it? - Hi. - Hey. Sorry to bother you. I was wondering if I could borrow some shampoo and a towel. Sure. One moment. So much for appreciation. - Here you go. - Thanks. After I day of traveling I could really use a shower. I know what you mean. I always hate it, like, after the whole traveling thing, you feel like you're covered in travel funk. Travel funk... I like that. So, where have you been? Here and there. Um, I don't know... besides our annual trips to New York and Park City, and Hawaii and Florida, I've been to Moscow... Paris, Monte Carlo, Tel-Aviv, Dubai, Rio, Sydney, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Rome, Greece. And last time I went on an African Safari. I got some great footage of this hyena eating a carcass. And how old are you? I just turned 18. Wow, you're really lucky. I guess so. You guess so? You're a world traveler. Not this weekend I'm not. I'm grounded. What for? Staying out too late. And how late is that? I got in time for breakfast. And you're surprised you got in trouble? It's not like I was doing anything. You know, my grandmother had this old saying... "Nothing good happens after midnight." Well... What if you're like a spy or something and you're gonna tell my dad everything that I am saying? I am not a spy. Whatever you tell me will stay just between us. I promise. So you're not like a cop or something? You're probably wearing a wire. I am not a cop. See, no wire. Fine. Seriously though. Nothing happened. We were just... I was out with my boyfriend - ex-boyfriend - and, I don't know, we just hung out all night. So, why is he an ex? We broke up. I mean... He's going to school in San Diego and I'm going to college in New York, and he thinks we should just both grow. You know, he's right. How's that? Long-distance relationships. They...just don't work. Sometimes they do. In the history of long-distance relationships, there's always one person that's fully committed and faithful, and one person who just uses it as a convenience. What convenience? A convenience to say that they're dating someone in another town... I don't know. The convenience of not having real relationships... For 30 days out of the month. A long-distance relationship is a low-maintenance relationship. So, what you're saying is, long-distance relationships are bullshit? Mostly, yeah. What if you get shipped off by Uncle Sam or something, and you're gone for 6 months to a year? That's true. I don't know. I mean if you really love someone, it shouldn't matter, I mean time or distance. In a perfect world, yeah... but some people suck at being alone. You know? If you're gonna be with somebody, you might as well be with them. And if they're somewhere else, then you're already without them, right? Wrong. I don't know. When you love someone, it doesn't matter where you're at. They never leave your heart. This one... is my favorite. Are you sure this is okay? It's more than okay. It's great. I didn't mean the wine. Oh, you mean me not being legally old enough to drink? Yeah, that. My mom used to say that if you tell someone not to do something they're gonna go ahead and do it. So ever since I was 14 I've been allowed to have a glass of wine at dinner time. Well, I hear wine is good for your heart. I'd agree with that. So, you're sure this is cool? He would totally insist on me opening a bottle of wine, especially for you. Girl scout's honor. You were a girl scout? No, but... if I was a girl scout, I wouldn't lie, right? Therefore somewhere out there is a girl scout, so, scouts honor. I can tell you're trouble. A lot of people keep saying that. But really I'm a good person. Good. Most of the time. Yours. All right... to new beginnings, and new friendships. Cheers. Mmm, this is really yummy. Is yummy good? Yes, but... Oh, my God. Sorry, he's calling to check that I'm home. Hello. Hey, Rachel, how's everything at home? Who the hell is this? Who do you think it is? It's your dad. Hi, Daddy. How's your trip? The trip is good. I just wanted to check and see how you are, and how our is guest doing. Yeah, she's all settled in. Good, good. Make sure to show her the wine cellar, and give her anything she wants. Open the wine cellar, give the girl in the guest house whatever she wants. Check. And show her around. I left a couple hundred in the night stand next to the bed. Go up to the nightstand. There is money in there. Show her around. Check. And she doesn't have a car so let her use mine. They keys are in my desk drawer. Let her drive your car. Anything else? Yeah, don't be a pain the ass. Let me talk to her. All yours. Hi, Frank. Amy, glad to see you arrived okay. If you need anything, just ask Rachel. Yeah, everything's great. Do you need anything? No, thanks a lot. I really appreciate it. Just enjoy the weekend. I'll be back Monday night, we'll put you to work Tuesday morning. If Rachel gives you any problems I want to know. She's been a great hostess. Thanks. Ah... I got to run. All right, just be sure to let me know- All right, bye. Come with me. Hmmm... Um, bye. If you're gonna be working with him, you better get used to that. I guess he's busy. He's always busy. But do I know my dad, or what? Oh, shit! I'm sorry. It's okay. No, no, no. I'll be, I'll be right back. Just... No, it's not that... Shit... Here. You can wipe that off, and then here's a shirt you can put on for now. Thanks. And we'll get you a new one as soon as we can. Really, don't worry about it. It's fine. I insist. It will get me out of the house for a few hours. I mean, come on. All right, fine. But let's have another glass, all right? All right. - You first. - You first. No, you first. You're the guest. Same time? Okay. Let's celebrate. All right, one more glass. But that's it. Come on, it's Friday night and neither one of us are driving. Yeah, but this is a little weird, you know. Here I am, drinking with my boss's daughter. Chill out. You're just socializing, right? Two months from now, you are going to be working... a 70-hour week. And you're going to look back at this weekend, and wish you had enjoyed it. Yeah, but if I enjoy it too much I won't have a job. My dad is lucky to have someone working for him like you. I mean you're smart, and you're beautiful, and you're kind of cool. Kind of like my new best friend. I am so sorry. You and your phone. It's...it's Jason. Hi, Jason. Where the fuck is my cell phone, you whore! I know you have it! I do not have your phone. Obviously you have a phone or you wouldn't be able to call me. I'm calling from my mom's phone. - Dude, fuck this shit. - Fuck YOUR shit! Look I'm packing, okay? I'll be leaving. You would pack, you whore! Don't go anywhere! You stay there! - Goodbye, Jason. - Don't hang up on me! Bye, Jason. Fuck you! You blonde bimbo! You won't hang up on me! You don't have the balls! He thinks I snatched his phone. Did you? He dumped me, and I don't know... Yes. You could have just left. Yeah, I did leave. The phone just decided to come with me. I had to do something to fuck up his day. I never said I was perfect. I know how that goes. Have you ever been in love? Have I ever been in love? You know, I'm not sure if I know what that means. I don't understand. I mean... I've always been sexual, you know. Sexy... Known how to turn guys on to get what I wanted, you know. But I've never felt comfortable... with a man or with anyone. I never let anyone in, you know. I mean it's about power... getting what I want. So, maybe fucking up someone's day has never been necessary for me... 'cause I've never been in love. But you've never fucked up their day by just sleeping with them? I try not to get too personal. So, not even once? Like, not even your first kiss? You've never like, just had that little... that one little moment, where it's like sparks and fireworks? Well, there is a guy I grew up with. You know, he was the one that was there for me when everyone else thought I was, you know... a slut or a feminist. And we were best friends and lovers. But he more felt like my little brother than anything else. Whoa, that's weird. No, I mean, but like, what was your first kiss like? I don't know. Soft...powerful. I like to feel powerful. - You know? - Yeah. But love... that's when you feel weak. Like jello in the knees. Yeah. God... On that note... I need to be going to bed. Do you want to take the bottle with you? I probably shouldn't. I've had enough. All right. More for myself then. I think they want us to make out. I think so. Naughty girl! Ahh! Hello...

I don't know... It's like whenever you write... it seems like my mom, I write about her. That is really cool. I sat you down, and I look at the stars. Oh, the good ol' stars. I always wanted to like, I don't know... see the world in that bigger sense. Like you do in a planetarium. If you could go anywhere, where would you go? Besides among the stars. I was just gonna say Venus. Oh, don't want to go to Mars? Ha ha, no. Men are from Mars, Eww... Do you not like men? I didn't say that. Men are great, but they're only useful for certain things, you know? And that is? What are they useful for? I'm not gonna go there right now. - No? - No, no, no... You're getting embarrassed.

Never gotten a tattoo, but this little girl has talked me into it. We want to get a key and a heart-shaped locket. Yeah. Like a heart-shaped locket, like a little key that opens up the locket. She's the key... to my locket. So, do you think you can do that? Yeah, totally. All right... Let's do it. This isn't gonna hurt, is it? Nah, you'll be fine. It looks great. I'm putting my body in your hands. Take care of me. - I'll do my best. - Please. You're gonna be okay.

Frank! Amy, what the hell is going on?! You didn't tell me you were coming home. Rachel! Amy! Why are you sleeping with my daughter? I'm in love with your daughter. Oh, my God! What the fuck? Get the fuck out of my house! You get out of here right now! This is my daughter! What about us? What the fuck are you doing here, Frank? You know that was a one-time thing! What about us? You told me it was over! Get the fuck out of my house! You get the fuck out of my house right fucking now! You still have some delusional idea that something was gonna happen between us? I told you that was a mistake! You said that you hiring me, had nothing to do with what happened between us! You got 15 minutes to get the fuck out of here! And you... Get in the living room and put some clothes on, young lady! Baby...please? Baby, let me explain... You fucked my dad. It's not as bad as it sounds. You either fucked him, or you didn't. So which is it? Did you fuck him or didn't you? Please let me explain. Last April... He...had a conference at a hotel near my college. After the talk he said he was hungry, and me and a couple of students went to dinner with him. We had a few drinks, and he was charismatic. Charismatic? Really? Please don't make this harder than it is already. Just listen to me. Fine. So after dinner... the two other students went out to a party. I was pretty drunk, so your dad invited me up to his hotel room so I could sober up. I was watching TV, and he took a shower, and came out in his bathrobe and sat next to me. He had really nice cologne on and he made me laugh... and the next thing I know we're kissing. It was a one-time thing... When I woke up in the morning I told him it was a mistake and it would never happen again. And he said that was fine. I never even heard from him again until three weeks ago, when he offered me a job. I was almost of college and I felt like I could do anything... and I didn't know what my future was. I didn't have any opportunities. I've been with younger guys. I know what that is... But I didn't know what it was like to be with an older man. I'd never done that before. I hadn't met you yet. I didn't know that there was such a thing as love. You got to believe me, Babe. Babe, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. You should have just told me. Once. Told me...anytime. And what would you have said? I don't know... Don't you love me? I loved you... But I can't do this. I'm sorry. Fuck! Goddamnit! Fuck! Goddamnit!

One more time, give it up for the oh, so beautiful, Rachel! Ladies and gentlemen, our next group, all the way across the pond from Europe. They are a very close group of friends of mine. I want everybody to give a very warm welcome to Cruiser! Great show. You should have seen Halloween's. It was much better. I did... You didn't say hi? I didn't think you'd want to see me. Are you scared of me? A little, yeah. It's the clothes and the makeup, right? Oh, yeah. I never thought you'd have blonde hair. You inspired me. You changed me. I have to be honest with you. Breaking up with you... it was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was afraid you were gonna say that. But it was also one of the best. I mean all of this... Me moving here, writing my own music, the applause just a minute ago. None of that would have happened without you. So, maybe we could be friends? Friends? Yeah. Just friends? I don't...believe that. How can you make this transition? What transition? To just be friends. That's it? Just friends? You would want something more than that? I thought you wouldn't be able to keep your hands off me. I've missed you so much. I missed you. Friends, just friends... Wooo! Get a room, girls! She's probably right, you know. Where should we go? I have a little loft around the corner. You want to follow me? I'll go anywhere you want. Okay. So, that's it? We're cool? That depends... I mean I kind of pulled a Taylor Swift, and some of the songs are about you. Well, do you feel better? Yeah. I mean it was kind of like therapy, you know? I love you. I love you, too. ♪
