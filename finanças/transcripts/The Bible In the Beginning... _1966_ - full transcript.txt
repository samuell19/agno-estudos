For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof& & then your eyes shall be opened& & and ye shall be as gods& & knowing good and evil. EVE: The serpent hath said that we shall not die& & that our eyes shall be opened and we shall be as gods. Taste it. There s no harm. It is& & disobedience. EVE: It will make us wise. NARRATOR: And the Lord God icalled unto Adam:/i i Where art thou? /i I heard thy voice and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself. GOD: Who told thee ithat thou wast naked?/i iHast thou eaten/i iof the tree& /i i& whereof I commanded thee/i ithat thou shouldst not eat?/i The woman thou gavest to be with me& & she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. iWhat is it that/i ithou hast done?/i The serpent beguiled me and I did eat. iBecause thou/i ihast done this& /i i& thou art cursed/i iabove all cattle& /i i& and above every beast/i iof the field./i iUpon thy belly/i ishalt thou go& /i i& and dust shalt thou eat/i iall the days of thy life./i iI will put enmity/i ibetween thee/i iand the woman& /i i& between thy seed/i iand her seed./i iIt shall bruise thy head& /i i& and thou shalt/i ibruise his heel./i iEve& /i i& I will greatly/i imultiply thy sorrow/i iand thy conception./i iIn sorrow shalt thou/i ibring forth children& /i i& and thy desire/i ishall be to thy husband& /i i& and he shall/i irule over thee./i iAdam, because thou/i ihast harkened/i iunto thy wife& /i i& and hast eaten/i iof the tree& /i i& cursed is the ground/i ifor thy sake& /i i& in sorrow/i ishalt thou eat of it/i iall the days of thy life& /i i& thorns also and thistles/i ishall it bring forth to thee./i iThou shalt eat/i ithe herb of the field./i iIn the sweat of thy face/i ishalt thou eat bread& /i i& until thou/i ireturn unto the ground./i iFor out of it/i iwas thou taken/i ifor dust thou art& /i i& and unto dust/i ishalt thou return./i (THUNDERS) (BABY CRYING) I have made a man from the Lord God.

My punishment is greater than I can bear! Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the Earth& & and from thy face shall I be hid.

Hey! (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (LOUD HAMMERING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) What is more stupid than this? A man building a ship on dry land! WOMAN 1: A devil is in him and hath made him mad& & and his sons with him! MAN 1: When shall the Earth see this again? He hath the sea in his head, and his house rides up on the waves. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Father, is it indeed God s voice thou hast heard? For look, there is no cloud in the sky. Not so much as would cover a bird. The Lord waiteth upon our work. Then what need is there of haste? Shall we not do it little by little& & under cover of night? He demandeth every hour of the day. In our obedience must be no delay. Will you question your father s understanding or doubt his ways? You should be ashamed. Yet when shall they be rid of the work? All things wait for this. The ground is unsown, and the house is unmended. Give me one to make the roof good& & lest when the rain comes the house will not keep it out. But, wife! Shem! More pitch! Ham! NOAH: We have need of more pitch! (SNORES) Japheth! Take the bucket and fill it, and our work is done! Shem! Ham! Japheth! GOD: Noah. iCome thou/i iand all thy house/i iinto the ark./i iI will cause it to rain/i iupon the Earth 40 days/i iand 40 nights./i iEvery living substance/i iI have made& /i i& will I destroy from off/i ithe face of the Earth./i iAnd of every living thing/i iof all flesh& /i i& two of every sort,/i imale and female& /i i& shalt thou bring/i iinto the ark to keep them/i ialive with thee./i Two& & of every sort. NOAH: Wife! Sons! Daughters! Fear not. The Lord hath spoken and said: Bring two of every kind to keep them alive. They have followed me and trust us& & to mind them and bring them to safety. They re good beasts at heart. They will do no harm to you, nor each other& & for they know of the waters that will fall upon the Earth. And God hath chosen them above all others. There are more yet to come. Japheth, help them find their way. Ham, Shem, load hay and grain. Wife and daughters, put oil into the lamps. And get thy house aboard the ark in order. (THUNDERS) NARRATOR: iAnd God shut him in./i (ANIMALS SQUAWK) (ELEPHANTS CRY) Is it the wind that waileth? No, wife. It is the chaff, which the wind driveth away. (PEOPLE CRY OUT) The Lord hath taken hold of the ends of the Earth& & and shaketh it. (ANIMALS SQUAWK) They cry to be fed. We have work to do. Shem& & care for the animals with hooves that cheweth the cud. Ham shall tend the camels, hares, swine and giraffes. Japheth, the tigers, the lions, the cats of all kinds. What shall they eat? Milk from the cattle and the goats. Milk? For beasts of prey? They re only great cats, wife. Do you not hear them purr? Be not afraid. He will do thee no harm, for harm is not in him. Shem, the red hart has not eaten of his corn. Fetch him leaves. NARRATOR: iThe waters prevailed, and all/i ithe high hills were covered./i iAnd Noah only/i iremained alive& /i i& and they that were/i iwith him in the ark./i When will the rain cease? When shall we stand again upon the Earth? God has told us it shall rain 40 days and 40 nights. But here we know neither the day nor the night. We cannot measure the time by sleep. We sleep when we will. When we are rested, we wake. The moon has no waxing or waning& & and the sun no rising or setting. We are without knowledge of time. Nay, but I know. Since the time we came into the ark& & and the doors shut, and the flood carried us upon its waters& & the days have been 20. And two. Twenty and two. How dost thou know what is hidden from us? By what rod dost thou measure the darkness? By the beasts, who carry the days within them. Even as the sun and the moon divide the seasons into hours. I know the time by the lowing of the cow ready to be milked& & and the cackle of the hen when the egg shall be gathered. I have counted the days. In 18 days, then, we ll know the world as before. Not so. When the rain stops, still the water will cover the earth. Neither shall we know the world as before. When the waters are dried up& & then we shall know. We shall be alone on the Earth. No other life. Where will the ark have carried us? In what strange land shall we be renewed? The Lord has put the future into our hands. (GOAT CRIES) All things will be new. (RAINING STOPPED) (POUNDING) (ROOSTER CROWS) (ANIMALS SQUAWK) (NOAH PLAYS FLUTE) Raven!

For now we know that the waters are abated from the Earth& & and we can find land. What sail shall discover the winds, and what rudder find our course? The breath of God shall divide the waves& & and his hand only lead us into safety. NARRATOR: The ark rested iin the 7th month,/i iof the 17th day/i iof the month& /i i& upon the mountains/i iof Ararat./i Hey! Hey, hey!

For the Canaanites go about the land. The understanding of God& & is not our understanding. And what shall be brought about and how it is perfected& & is not in our power to know. Only in the promise of what shall come& & can we prosper. And in that trust& & have we pitched our tents. Wife. Abram. My husband. The sun has gone down. We have laboured until evening. I bring my love beside you in the tent& & as day answereth day. Let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits. Behold. Thou art fair, my love. Behold, thou art fair. I have drawn away from my beauty as from a stranger& & for the years have gone with the going down of the sun. Your beauty stands in a sanctuary. The enemy falters in the street& & and sheathes his sword in the marketplace. Time& & cannot pass the door. The strong lock of the door is love& & and the key& & is in my hand. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood& & so is my beloved among the sons. H is left hand is under my head& & and his right hand doth embrace me.

And between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are brethren. Our substance is too great for us to dwell together. The land is not able to bear us together. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. lf thou will go left, I will go to the right& & or if thou go right, I will go to the left. There below us is the plain of Jordan. And that way I will go. Toward the cities of the plain. The men of the cities are wicked, and sinners before the Lord. From here the walls of Sodom and Gomorrah are white. But within the walls& & is the darkness of men. Many tribes and their kings try to claim their domination& & and the city walls are refuge and strength. God is my refuge and strength. The plain is well-watered everywhere& & fertile with fruits of the earth& & even as the Garden of the Lord. That is the way I shall take. And my way is another. GOD: Lift up now ithine eyes& /i i& and look from the place/i iwhere thou art& /i i& northward and southward/i iand eastward and westward./i iFor all the land/i iwhich thou seest& /i i& to thee will I give it/i iand to thy seed forever./i Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless?

Abram. Behold now. The Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee& & go in unto my maid& & according to that law which says: When a wife is barren& & her maidservant may bear for her. It may be that I may obtain children by her. I give thee my handmaiden& & Hagar the Egyptian& & to be thy wife. Is it so& & that the promise of many nations shall be fulfilled? Even so& iAnd Abram went in to Hagar/i iand she conceived& /i i& and when it came/i inear the time/i ithat she should/i ibear a child& /i i& Sarai, her mistress,/i iwas despised in her eyes./i Are you not tired? Let us stay our hands& & and eat and drink, now that the sun is gone. Fruits of thy kind. Figs that are dry, and dates and raisins. But for me& & the fruits that ripen. Go away from me! Why weepest thou? I am ashamed. For what cause? Did I not say to thee: Go in to my maid that I may obtain children by her ? Even so? Now I am despised by her that she carries the child in her body. I am but the grass that is bruised where she walks. I look through her eyes and see myself as one who no longer lives. The fulfilment of the earth passes to strangers. And I am left as I was never born. But the child is thine& & by thy maidservant& & and by the love I bear thee. NARRATOR: iFrom the south, even unto/i ithe plain of Jordan& /i i& came four warring kings:/i iThe kings of Shinar,/i iof Ellasar& /i i& of Elam, and Tidal,/i iking of nations./i iThese made war/i iwith the king of Sodom& /i i& and the king of Gomorrah/i iand the king of Admah& /i i..and the king of Zeboiim/i iand the king of Zoar./i iFour kings with five./i iThey joined battle/i iin the vale of Siddim./i iThe vale of Siddim/i iwas full of slime pits& /i i& and the kings of Sodom/i iand Gomorrah fled/i iand fell there& /i i& and the victors/i itook captives and goods/i iand went their way./i And Lot? And Lot, my brother s son Lot? He is taken captive. Shall the land that is promised to us have no peace? And my blood be taken into slavery? Eliezer. My lord? Summon Mamre, the Amorite& & and Aner and Eshcol, his brothers who are confederates. And you, my trained servants& & born in mine own house& & gather at the tents. Three hundred eighteen we be. How shall we prevail against so many? They have gotten the victory, and left off watching. I will divide us against them by night& & and smite them.

Thou art my shield and my exceeding great reward. iGOD: I am the Almighty God./i iWalk before me/i iand be thou perfect./i iThy name shall/i ino more be Abram& /i i& but thy name/i ishall be Abraham./i iFor kings shall/i icome out of thee& /i i& and I will establish/i imy covenant/i ibetween me and thee& /i i& and thy seed after thee,/i iand their generations,/i ito be their God./i iAs for Sarai, thy wife,/i ithou shalt not/i icall her name Sarai& /i i& but Sarah/i ishall her name be./i iAnd I will bless her/i iand give thee a son,/i ialso of her./i iAnd she shall be/i ia mother of nations./i Thy child. By my maidservant, and by the love I bear thee. The smell of my son is like a field which the Lord has blessed. iGOD: This is my covenant,/i iwhich ye shall keep/i ibetween me and you& /i i& and thy seed after thee./i iEvery man-child among you/i ishall be circumcised& /i i& as a token of the covenant/i ibetwixt me and you./i Thou hast 24 score and 7 in thy flock. By each pebble I know you as good servants. You are blessed among us and are indeed our blessing. My lord. Behold. Thy son, Ishmael, hath seven years. Give him thy blessing, I pray& & that he may live before God as the first of thy flesh, and thy only son. Yet have I told thee how it stands between me and Ishmael. For God hath said He will bless Sarah and give me a son also& & of her. Wilt thou indeed believe what cannot come to pass? The years have gone by and the promise is not fulfilled. With Sarah, thy wife& & the time of childbearing is over. Give Ishmael, therefore, thy blessing. Thou can hope for no other. Shall the Lord speak and Abraham not believe? What is faith if it say, This thing cannot be ? And as for Ishmael& & God has said Behold& & I have blessed him and will make him fruitful. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac& & which Sarah shall bear unto thee. And so I wait upon his will& & even beyond the time. NARRATOR: And Abraham waited iupon the will of God./i iAnd God was silent,/i ias one who searches/i ithe strength of a man./i iThree years passed/i iand two more added& /i i& and Sarah and/i iAbraham grew old./i My Lord& & if now I have found favour in thy sight& & pass not away from thy servant. We go down towards the city& & toward Sodom& & where Lot, thy brother s son, sits in the gate of the city. Rest yourselves, I pray thee& & under the tree. And comfort ye your hearts. Where is Sarah, thy wife? Behold, in the tent. I will certainly return unto thee, and lo& & Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son. After I am waxed old& & shall I have pleasure& & my Lord being old also? Wherefore did Sarah laugh? Is anything too hard for the Lord? I laughed not! Nay& & but thou didst laugh. At the time appointed I will return unto thee& & and Sarah shall have a son. We are going& & towards the cities of the plain. I will bring you on your way. Shall I hide from Abraham& & that thing which I do? Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great& & and because their sin is very grievous& & I will go down now& & and see whether they have done altogether& & according to the cry of it, which has come unto me& & and if not, I will know. Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? There may be 50 righteous& & within the city. Wilt thou not spare the place for them? Shall not the judge of all the Earth& & do right? lf I find 50 righteous within the city& & I will spare all the place for their sakes. What if there be 45 such men? Or 30? Or even as few as 20? I will not destroy it& & for 20 s sake. Let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure, 10 shall be found there. iI will not destroy it& /i i& for 10 s sake./i NARRATOR: iWhen the sun was down,/i iLot sat in the gates/i iof the city./i iAnd he lift up/i ihis eyes and looked& /i i& and beheld two strangers/i icoming into the city./i (WOMAN SCREAMS) (WICKED LAUGHTER) (LAUGHING) (WOMAN MOANS) (MOANS) What strangers are these? Where are they from? Two angels of God. So fair they are. So fair. (POUNDING ON THE DOOR) (POUNDING) Where are they? What have you done with them? Yes, bring them out unto us! Bring them, that we may know them! I pray, brethren, do not so wickedly. For these strangers here with us are of God. Better you destroy all I possess& & than any harm should be done them. Behold, I have two daughters which have not known man. Let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you& & and do ye to them as is good in your eyes& & only unto these men do nothing. This one fellow came in to sojourn& & and he will needs be a judge? Now will we deal worse with thee than with them! I cannot see! Whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place& & for the Lord hath sent us to destroy it. Take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here& & lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. Look not behind thee. (BABY CRYING) (WOMEN CLAP) The name of our son shall be called Isaac. Thy son& & and mine. God hath made me laugh. All that hear will laugh with me. Who would have said unto Abraham& & that Sarah would have given children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age. In him& & are the stars of the heavens& & and the sands of the seashore. NARRATOR: iAnd the child grew& /i i& and Abraham made/i ia great feast the same day/i iIsaac was weaned./i Cast out this bondwoman and her son. Who has put this into thy heart? Did you not see how he went among us mocking? I have a great fear there will come such division in our people. Like Cain and Abel again. I beg you, cast out this bondwoman and her son! The son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son& & even with Isaac. What sayest thou? He is my seed. I will not cast out the lad, nor thy bondwoman. NARRATOR: But God said iunto Abraham:/i i Let it not be/i igrievous in thy sight/i ibecause of the lad& /i i& and because/i iof thy bondwoman./i iIn all that Sarah/i ihath said unto thee,/i ihearken unto her voice& /i i& for in Isaac shall/i ithy seed be called. /i iAnd Abraham sent her away,/i iand she departed& /i i& and wandered/i iin the wilderness/i iof Beersheba./i Lord! Let me not see the death of the child! iAnd an angel of God/i icalled to Hagar/i iout of heaven& /i i& and he said unto her:/i What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not& & for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. iAnd God was with the lad& /i i& and he grew/i iand became a great nation./i ABRAHAM: Here are the generations of my fathers named& & to whom God gave life. It has fallen to me that the past shall not be forgotten& & and after me& & my son& & also shall remember it. By what descent are ye come? These are the generations of which I am made& & of Noah, who by faith prepared an ark& & to the saving of this house. Noah begat Shem& & and Shem, Arphaxad& & and after him was Salah, who begat Eber& & and his son was Peleg& & the father of Reu, who begat Serug& & the father of Nahor& & and Nahor begat Terah& & whose son was Abraham, my father. Here are the names written. And here shalt thy name be also& & Isaac, son of Abraham& & when thou takest my place. Put thy hand upon it. GOD: Abraham& iAbraham!/i Here I am. The night is filled with thy voice. Here am I. What dost thou demand of me? iThy son./i iThy only son./i What sayest thou? iTake now thy son& /i i& thy only son, Isaac,/i iwhom thou lovest& /i i& and go into the mountains,/i iwhere I shall show thee& /i i& and offer him there/i ifor a burnt offering./i Wouldst thou I do even as the Canaanites& & who lay their first-born on fires before idols? Art thou truly the Lord, my God? iThou knowest./i No! Thou wilt not& & ask this thing of me! Isaac& & take leave of thy mother. Mother, I am going on a journey. A journey? We are going on a journey of three days. I am going with my father. What does thou tell me? A journey unto the land of Moriah! Unto Moriah? Why unto Moriah? God hath commanded that we go there to sacrifice unto him. Six days must I wait for thee? Mother, it is a little time. I have waited for thee until I was old. The days are precious to me. Isaac, Isaac& What should I fear& & if thou goest with thy father? Father& & this was a city? The city of Sodom. Lot sat here in this gate. And here& & came the two angels to him. He overthrew these cities and all the plain& & and all the inhabitants of the cities& & and that which grew upon the face of the ground. All the inhabitants? And lo, the smoke of the country went up& & as the smoke of a furnace. The Lord, our God, must be obeyed. All the inhabitants of the cities? The children also? Were the children also wicked? Father? Shall not the judge of all the Earth& & do right? Call the nobles to the kingdom! None are here. All the princes are nothing! Father! All the princes are nothing! The thorns have come up in the palace. From generation to generation it will lie& & waste. Ye shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion. Has it not been told from the beginning, God is He that sitteth& & upon the circle of the Earth& & that stretcheth out the heaven as a curtain& & and spreadeth them out as a tent wherein to dwell& & that bringeth the princes to nothing? Ye shall blow upon them& & and they shall wither! And the whirlwind& & shall take them away& & as stubble. My son& & the Lord God& & appeared unto me& & and said unto me, l am the Almighty God. Walk before me& & and be thou& & perfect. Behold, my covenant is with thee& & and I will make thee& & exceedingly& & fruitful. Come, let us leave these ruins& & and go from here into the mountains. In all things& & we must obey Him. NARRATOR: iThen on the third day& /i i& Abraham lift up his eyes/i iand saw the place, afar off./i The wood. The fire. The knife. But where is the ram for the sacrifice? Father! My son! There is nothing He may not ask of thee? Nothing. GOD: Abraham! iAbraham!/i Here am I. iLay not thy hand/i iupon the lad& /i i& for now I know/i ithat thou fearest God& /i i& seeing that thou hadst/i inot withheld thy son& /i i& thy only son, from me./i There is the ram for the sacrifice. iBehold, I have tried thee/i ilike metal in a furnace./i iI have chosen thee/i iin the furnace of affliction./i iNow will I multiply thy seed/i ias the stars of the heaven& /i i& and as the sand/i iwhich is by the seashore,/i iinnumerable./i
