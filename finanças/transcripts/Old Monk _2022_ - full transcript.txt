. Because we can't see God, we won't stop worship. Because you are not with us, we won't stop loving you. This movie is a tribute to the Smile King who won the war without fighting. Awesome! And that's a four! Like I predicted, RCB is going to win this match! Can you please reduce the smoke? I am not able to see the TV clearly. Okay, boss. Take, eat. Darling, why don't you also join me in watching this interesting match? Kohli is about to score a 100 runs his idea of a birthday treat for us, I guess! How do I care if someone scores a century or celebrates his birthday? Looks like my nightingale is singing out of tune today, no? Yes, boss. Baby, are you irked with me for eating the butter without offering you? Have some. Be it butter or ghee. eat whatever the hell you want, like I care! Why are you getting angry? Only if you tell me what I have I done will I be able to correct my mistake, right? You are my boyfriend, right? Sit and think what you have done! Baby, baby.. Now it's impossible to figure out the reason behind a woman's anger even after reading the Bhagavat Geetha! Even after preaching it one is also unable to decipher the reasons! I should hold a discussion with Lord Brahma on this topic. Narayana, Narayana.. Narada Muni is here, go open the door for him. Narayana, Narayana.. I offer a warm welcome to the FM station of all the three worlds! Please make yourself comfortable. So, tell me what brings you here today? By FM, you mean Radio Jockey, right? Nope! I mean Fitting Master! All you do is carry tales from one person to the other, right? Narada, while I am very well aware of your scheme of affairs here in heaven. I'm curious to know your game plan for earth dwellers. Well, Krishna, mothers were created as God can't be everywhere. Just like that relatives have also been created to further my cause! In fact, they are way better than me in my own game! Oh, wow! - By the way, where is your wife? Don't ask! She seems to be very upset with me from morning. She is not even telling me. - Is it? Can you talk to her and find out what's wrong? Definitely, definitely.. Darling, baby, Ruku see who is here. Hello! Bhabiji! You didn't have to! I mean today is your special day after all. In fact, that's the reason I'm here. This is wishing you a very happy birthday! I've got your favourite red velvet cake made from Ammaa's Pastry and that too with extra cheese. Thank you so much, that's really sweet of you. You are welcome. Darling, happy birthday, my love. OMG! OMG! Krishna, you are yet to wish her or what? Seriously? What is he saying? I mean last month it was Goddess Parvathi's birthday and Lord shiva planned a conference call and had all the deities wish her. Leave that, just two days ago, Lord Srinivasa threw a lavish party for Lakshmi on her birthday. But in your case, your birthday is almost coming to an end and he has not even wished you, you say! My love, I also wanted to surprise you but what to do he came here first and surprised me only! You don't love me, that's it. I do love you. - No. I'm going to go to my mom's house. - Don't. You should. Here you go. Leave this place. But Ruku, Ruku! Narayana, Narayana! Done is done Krishna, set a reminder for her next birthday at least. Anyway, my job here is done. I'll make a move. Narada, you turned my milk like family sour by squeezing lime into it! See Krishna, I squeeze lime into lemon rice also. it's just that that part goes unnoticed. I need to do certain things for greater good. Greater good? - Yes. The reason behind this act of yours is not greater good it's the fact that you are single! So, I today curse you to go to earth fall in love with a girl and convince her family to get you both married. Only when you do that will you be allowed to enter heaven. But Krishna, Krishna! Like I always say, I will come in every era to reestablish dharma. And you will fall in love as that is your karma! OLD MONK I retained all the personality traits of Narada, my celestial form even after I came to Earth. (Prayers being offered to deities) Lord Ganesha, can you see me? This is my first day at work. I've stepped into my office. Please ensure that everything goes smoothly. Good morning, Sir. Good morning, come. I wanted to talk to you about something. We will, first take theertham. Tell me what's bothering you? Sir, we both love each other. - You are lovers? Good. We are planning to get married as well. You are marrying the one you love, even better! Go ahead. - Thank you, sir. But.. Sir, only you can save our relationship. - Okay, relax, relax. Your family is against this alliance, is it? - No! Then is your family not okay with you marrying him? - No, sir. Then? - The problem is not our family, it's this office. What? - Office? Sir, our HR is a sadist. He is averse to the idea of lovers and love marriages. Even if he gets a whiff of the employees who have fallen in love he finds ways to terminate them. He is such a jerk. Sir, we are about to get married. I can't leave her, then again, I can't quit this job either. What rubbish, how can one mix something that is personal with one's profession? Who is he to stop you when I am here? I'll look into this issue, don't worry. You may leave. Thank you, sir. - Please go. What is this, Lord Ganesha? What is this, PA? Sir? - What the hell is all this? Are you saying there are no couples in this office? Sir, forget people, that HR does not even allow for photos or idols of couple Gods to be kept. Meaning? Sir, there is a Ganesha idol at the entrance, right? Previously idols of Krishna and Radha were kept there. But this guy came.. Hi, Krishna, how are you? Krishna, you are indeed my favourite God. But that doesn't mean that you get to break my office rules. The rules that everyone but you are following. Krishna, I even requested you to break up people who keep falling in and out of love and help freshers like me find a lover. But you seem to turn a blind eye. Okay, let me guess, this attitude of yours may have something to do with the fact that you have 16,000 girlfriends and would never understand the plight of single boys, right? Then let me also do something to get across my point strong and clear. Krishna.. - Sir. Place Radha's idol on her 30th floor - Sir! Place Krishna's idol in the ground floor. - Sir! And here place my boss, Ganesha's idol and perform pooja everyday. Sir! And ever since, only bachelor Gods have made it to screensavers and desks. Sir, photos are still okay, imagine my fate as I had tattooed Krishna's name on my hand just before joining this office. Okay, what happened next? (name of a famous Kannada film comedian) This is too much. Sir, that is nothing. I am in charge of weekend fun activities. I arranged for the screening of 'Mungaru Male'. Tell me what's wrong with that? It is wrong all the way. Stop! And that was the last time any romantic film was screened! Thereafter only films that highlight brother-sister bond are being screened! But I see a Hindi film has also been screened. 'Bhai Ka Pyaar'. Is that a Salman Khan film? No sir, that is the dubbed version of a brother-sister film. It was screened for the benefit of our north Indian colleagues! Oh God! Sir, all this is still bearable. Imagine our plight. We three are mechanical engineering students. We came to the IT industry so that at least in our work space we can meet girls! But here this guy expects men and women to sit separately. Even our restrooms are on different floors! Forget that, we thought we could socialize with them in the parking lot. But here, lower basement has been reserved for women and upper basement parking for men! Sir, I had thought there could not be a bigger villain than KGF's Garuda. But when compared to our HR, even Garuda comes across as humane. At least he allows men and women to stay in the same place. But our HR! Cool down. Calm him down. But did none of you oppose these draconian rules? Didn't any of you protest? Sir. I dared to do so. Excuse me. What's happening here? I haven't done anything wrong and you can't do anything to me. - Oh! I log in at 8 am and log out at 5 pm. I don't waste time on social media during working hours. This is my lunch hour. She is my friend. I have the right to socialize with whomever I want. I don't owe you an explanation in this regard You are a HR and you should limit your role to just that! Excellent. At least you had the guts to question him. There is more to this story, sir. Those who are wrong carry fear in their hearts. - Hmm. But for those who are right fear is nothing more than a word in a dictionary. Very good. Do one thing, have your parents come meet me tomorrow. Parents? We have heard of parents-teachers meetings in school. But have you come across an employee-parent meeting, ever sir? No way! But here, that's the norm! Is there a problem? Did my son do anything wrong? Actually.. - Dad.. You have nothing to worry about. I have not committed any mistake. He is right. He has done nothing wrong. In fact, he is very punctual. But here is a screenshot of the footage captured in the CCTV on our 7th floor. Looks exactly like your son. You smoke? No, Dad, my friends forced me to try. So it was just a onetime thing. Those were images from day before yesterday. Now look at these screenshots captured yesterday, sir. They were taken at 10 am, 12pm, 2pm and 4 pm. If you keep swiping right, you can spot your future daughter-in-law too! What daughter-in-law? That's Nasriyat Begum. Is she a Muslim? Yes, sir. OMG! How could you do such a thing? We are such devout Hindus! Just because you are financially independent doesn't mean you can do as you please. Sir, he is still young, let it be. You stay out of this. I'll handle it my way. Please, sir. I have given this issue much thought. From tomorrow all these rules will be changed. Going forward you have no one or nothing to fear in this office. I'll take care. For proof.. Hey, the couple standing there, come here. They make an adorable couple, right? I'll make sure these two get married tomorrow. There is nothing that even that sadist HR can do to stop me. And in case he does manage that, I will.. Hmmmm, right, I will shave my moustache! That's a promise and I will stick to it no matter what! There is so much exaggeration about me and my atrocities. But not a single person has cared to find out why I am the way I am! Anyway, I'll only tell you why. Wow, look at these babes! Who are these new entrants? Thanks to Lord Krishna's curse, I crash landed on earth. And just like he had wished I started falling in love with every other girl I met. But every time I came close to impressing her and her family. And return to heaven.. You scoundrel, you smart ass. In every film, the villain makes an entry only after the interval but in my film, he marked his presence right at the start! You can become a doctor, actor, saint or a mechanical engineer.. Oh! Wait, they are one and the same thing right! Anyway, you are free to do whatever you want but you have to enter into an arranged marriage only. Meet my dad, Narayan. My father is usually a YES Narayan when it comes to love and love marriage, he becomes a NO Narayan. And No to what extent you ask? Take a look. Sir, he is your first born. - Yes. He is born with a powerful star sign too. - Good to know. Give him a name that starts with the letter A that will bring him a lot of luck. Why not? A, okay then, shall we name him Aryavardhan? - Yes, yes! Aryavardhan? No way. I'll think of a good name for him. Appanna! Appanna! But this is such an old-fashioned name. Old fashioned my foot! My decisions are always logical. See tomorrow, when he grows up he will most likely be attracted to girls. When that happens, the girl will have no choice but to address him as either Appanna (father) or Anna (brother) and hence he can never be addressed endearingly as a lover! Appanna, Appanna, Appanna.. Now you know the logic behind my name, right? We are a family that prides over arranged marriages. So far there has been no love marriage. And the man responsible for this is my great, great, great grandfather. That sadist died without being able to make any woman fall for him and before kicking the bucket and in the name of 'tradition' insisted that all the men in the family should go for arranged marriage only. In spite of doing this, I feel his soul is still not resting in peace and is making its presence felt through our relatives! Arranged marriages are akin to online shopping. Only after the delivery is made do we realise that what we order is way different from what we actually get! In online shopping, we at least have the return option but, in the case, of arranges marriages all you are offered is the adjust option! But at a very young age I realised that arranged marriage was not my cup of coffee! I had decided mine will be a love marriage no matter what. Girlfriend, love marriage! No way! - Why, guruji? His horoscope suggests that he is not destined to fall in love. There is nothing but negativity when it comes to the love department. This is a result of bad karmasutra of love. Meaning? Meaning, your time is just not right! Just like you were responsible for my breakup with Rukmini I'll be responsible for all your love stories gone wrong. Nothing can go right in one's life, if time is not on your side. For example Just like default mobile wall papers boys have a default lover, a close relative's daughter! What? You will marry me only know after you grow up? Of course, I will. - Promise me? Promise. God promise? - God promise. Mother Promise? Hey, swear on your grandmother, I will get married to you only. Mom, how could you leave us and go? How will we live without you? Mother, mother! After this episode, Kirana came into my life Every time we met, she would teach me something. That's why I called her Gurukiran (teacher), with love of course! Anyways, I finally mustered the courage to propose to her on Valentine's Day. But while I sat waiting for her, a girl came walking down the stairs. Her shoe lace was undone and I told her that. She requested me to hold on to a bunch of roses that she was carrying so that she could tie the lace. Once she was done, I gave back the roses. And the timing could not have been any worse. For that's when my Kirana came towards me. And just like that my second love story ended. When you see a fruit high up on a tree, you first try to pick it with a stick. If you fail at it, you don't give up but climb the tree yourself! My life also took a U turn and I landed up joining an IT company. Here, I felt like I was going to fall in love with every girl I met! And then one day. After you, please come in. I'm seeing you for the first time in this office. Yes, it's been only a week since I reported to work. Hi, I'm Samskruti. You are lying. No really, that's my name. You are Netflix, right? What? Okay, then you must be Amazon Prime? Why? They can't stop watching you all day long! Bro, can you share the Netflix password with me also? Meet my BFF, Singh, Ranveer Singh. He is a diehard fan of actor Ranveer Singh and that explains his dressing sense. This scene should tell you all about his character. Because of him my first office love story came to an end. This is how. Well, it was April Fool's Day and Ranveer challenged me that he would prank my girl. This is what happened next. Hi, Samskruthi. Hi, Ranveer, what's up? Nothing much. The thing is, I know who you were with and where yesterday. You have gotten it all wrong. I dined out with Rakesh, that's it. Dinner? Rakesh? Is it true? You are lying to me, Samskruti. I know. So, did you see everything that followed? What? Hotel? Room, etc.. Etc, etc.. It seems! Listen, please don't tell Appu anything. Rakesh forced me into it. Please don't tell Appu anything. I want to get married only to him. When it came to my love stories, it seemed like it was always bad timing. It was only after this incident did I truly understand the essence of human relationships as portrayed in the film 3 Idiots. You feel low when you are single, of course. But what truly hurts is the fact that you are single and all your friends are in a relationships. So that day I decided to teach such couples a lesson. Appu, what exactly do you have in mind? Until and unless I find myself a girlfriend, who is worthy of marriage I'll make sure that everyone else in this office remains single. Bro, that's so unfair! In fact, it's like expecting temples to be closed down just because your prayers are not being answered! While it's not very bothersome if the entire area faces an electricity failure but it gets super irritating when there is power in every other house but yours. But you need to be in a power position to execute your plan. You need to be a team lead at least! But that requires me to butter my higher ups and I won't do that. How about a manager then? That's going to take forever. CEO? Not old enough to be one. What the! Okay. What the hell do you want to become then? Let's get back to our good old college days. You want to become a don, is it? Go one step further. A terrorist? - Damn, you! Look up. And that explains my behaviour and that's how I am where I am today. Now let's get down to business. Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. Who are you all? I'm a hair stylist. You mean barber? Yes, sir. But as you can see, I don't need you. You will need me, sir. How? You have promised to shave your moustache if you fail remember so here I am all set for you. I'm here from Movers and Packers. What for? I'm sure you won't have it in you to stay in your old locality after facing a miserable defeat. So I'm here to offer you our services at a discounted price. I see! And you would be? There is no way you'll continue to hold your position in your current company after losing this challenge. So, I'm here to collect your resume so that I can find you suitable jobs. Okay! And you? What if you go into depression after failing miserably? I want to be hands-on if that happens. I'm Dr. Sudarshan, your future psychiatrist. Are you guys so sure of this marriage being cancelled? Of course, sir. No chance! Hi! Hi, sir. Who are you? I'm the HR, sir. You? - Yeah. Yes. Sir, I was on sick leave yesterday. But I heard you came to office yesterday and challenged me. Hello, listen up! - Yes, sir. You are after all a HR. - Yes, sir. And I am a board member. - Yes, sir! So, you really think you can stop this marriage from happening? I'll try me best to do that. I will also see how that's going to happen. I will also see! This is wishing you both a very happy married life. So, Arjun... - Tell me. (Recites a Sanskrit verse that describes a particular day) What? Looks like our boy here is not very well aware of Hindu culture. Anyway, where were you on January 1, 2019? I will remind you. You had gone on a trip to Gokarna with your friends. There were 16 of you on that trip. But only 15 rooms were available. Which means one of you had to become the bigger person and share a room and that person was you. What's wrong with that? I don't see a problem there. Correct, sir. Valid point! It's only decent to step up and offer help when a girl needs it! But what's surprising is that someone who could afford a Rs 2500 room didn't think it fit to spend an extra hundred bucks and arrange for an extra bed! Two weeks later, I mean just in the span of 15 days that girl gets a promotion. In a company where you rarely manage to get only a 10 percent hike a 25 percent hike and a promotion was given just like that! Is that true? - Yes, sir. Really? Sir, that girl was really good at her job. Correct, sir. Later, he even took on her pilgrimages to Tirupati, Subramanya and Dharmasthala. But his prayers went unnoticed I guess for he failed to win her love. You see, be it romance, affair or a screenshot none of these can be hid for long! Anyways, that's none of my business. Happy married life again! Thank you. You scumbag! Why the hell would I marry someone like you? Preeti, Preeti, just hear me out. Hello, excuse me! - Preeti! Hello, just a minute. To gain knowledge, we need text books. For money, cheque books. To know about love, we need hotel invoices! Bless me Lord Ganesha. I love bachelor Gods! I'll see you around then. I am after all a HR. What can I do, right, sir? See you. Appu! So, Appu, are you happy? I had seen you when you were a child, you have grown so much! Bro, just check if your zip is open? Just making sure! What was that? I was asking him where the bride is? Why will she be here? What do you mean? She is at her place. Her place? Yes, apparently, you were okay with this alliance as long as the elders in the family approved of it. That's why your father came to our place yesterday only and interacted with our daughter. Dad, you are playing with my life! What are you grumbling about? No, he was just wondering if you would have a passport photo of the girl? He will be content seeing that. So, if you have one, can you please show him? Photo? You think you are old enough to see a photo and take decisions? You know, I saw your mother's face only on the day we tied the knot. She's right here, you can confirm with her. Also, I got to see her properly only four hours after we got married! Trust! You need to trust, for that's the crux of a meaningful life dear! Naani.. - What? But I knew the boy would want to see some photos of our girl. So, I brought along a photo album of hers. I also knew something like this would happen! I was 100 percent sure. Nonsense! Please give. This was unnecessary. I hope your father is not forcing you into a child marriage?! I have no clue, why don't you ask him? Those are school days photos. This is very nice, do you have any other photos? We mean current photos, present photos.. Yey, when current came these photos were taken. This is correct. If you talk more, he will give adhar card, say yes now. What is that? Nothing, If i get a chance to talk with the girl it would be great. That's all he wants. Mr Appanna, you know what our elders say talking too much is bad for the heart messaging bad for the mind and internet. After marriage, both of you will be together only. Talk as much as you want. You keep quiet until then. Naani. - Enni, be calm. Nani, keep quiet. You can talk all you want then. Till then keep your trap shut! Actually, I'm sure he has a solution to this problem as well. Correct. In fact, my daughter, for your sake.. Not mine, just his.. Yes, I meant his only, she has sent you a voice note just for you. Please play it. It's a good thing. Hi, Appu.. After seeing your photo.. - What is this? ..I couldn't sleep. You are okay for me. My daughter is the shy types, so even her voice notes don't exceed 5 seconds. That shows how cultured she is! True, true, her voice even reminded me of S Janaki! Okay then, now that you have seen the groom interacted with him and even had coffee. I think its time to make the next move. Find a priest and fix a suitable date for the engagement I feel you are rushing into this. I mean at least for formality. The girl's parents are here. Let them ask the boy a question or two and then take a call, right? That won't be necessary. We approve of the boy. Who asked for your approval? I was referring to ma'am. I see an element of confusion on her face. Come on ma'am, tell me what you want to know? I was wondering where you got this work done for your skirt? It's very trendy. You want this? See, this is why I kept asking you to befriend only boys! You should have.. You mean me? Right! - Okay. Okay, I think the purpose of our visit has been served. This is a happy occasion so what better time than now to go ahead and fix the marriage date. Let's go ahead and plan the wedding and double our happiness Yes, that's the priority now. How could they? If you are loafer, I am your father! Mind it! Okay.. Say okay, bro. Dude, you got to fall in love with someone ASAP! True, or else this father of mine will get me married based on voice chats and video calls! Damn that bloody fellow! Hello, only I can abuse my father. Sorry, I could not stop myself from saying that. By the way, why are we here? We are zeroing in on a project for our company's CSR activity. Since you are our HR, we need your approval. And what is this all about? This initiative is called Art of Loving. This is basically an old age lovers' home. Old age lovers home? What is that? Its purpose is to reunite lovers, who were separated due to fate's twisted ways. So here these lovers are brought together and their love rekindled. I wish they had such a facility for youngsters as well. At least people like me would have benefitted from that! Nearby Annaporneshwari Ladies paying guest facility will solve your problem. Shut Up! It's so difficult for an eligible and young man like me only to impress a girl. And you are saying these old people manage to reclaim their lost love! Ridiculous! That's called talent brother, talent! As if! Everyone.. What? Look there. Hey you! Bloody oldies! 'What a what a what a.. Colour butterfly!' 'I fell at first sight' 'Sparkling cracker' 'Lit little by little' 'She reached my heart by climbing the stairs' 'Will you be mine?' 'My red pawn' 'Our matching is super fine' 'Quick chats And super-fast posts' 'The corner site has been booked' 'When you stand beside me' 'You shine like the stars' 'Sound the drums! La La La' 'When you stand beside me' 'You shine like the stars' 'Sound the drums! La La La' 'When you stand beside me' 'You shine like the stars' 'Sound the drums! La La La' 'When you stand beside me' 'You shine like the stars' 'Sound the drums! La La La' I love you. Me? - Stop gaping and step aside, dude. Is this for me? I am totally okay with you. Please hold this. Take this, I hope you will never let go of me. I swear on my mother, I won't. Oh God, you work in mysterious ways. We are the winners. - No ways, we won! Sorry brother, it was just a dare. Thank God, dude, step aside. Hi. - Hi. By the way, may I know what brings you here? We are here on official work. May I have a word with you privately? - Sure.. Please come brother. Brother? Did I just get bro zoned? Hi. How may I help you? Does this thing work? He was made like this, can we cut to the chase. Sorry. Yes, so the thing is.. We are planning a CSR activity.. We are actually here to get more details about this Swayamvara poster that's stuck all over the place. Oops! I am sorry to disappoint you. Yeah. But that's not for you guys, its for the elderly. Come on let's go, its for the elderly only. You are mistaken, we are here to enroll for my grandfather. In that case, please bring your grandfather at 10 am on the 28th that's day after tomorrow by the way. May I know your name? I am Abhigna. I am Appu. And I am the power behind him.. - He is Singh, Ranveer singh. My colleague.. - I am supposed to be saying it. Yeah, yeah. Okay ma'am, we will leave now. Okay, it was nice meeting you. See you soon. And just one other thing does anyone in your old age home have amnesia or alzhimers? No one. Knew it, how can anyone forget your pretty face, otherwise? Okay. We are leaving. Please replace this with a working conch. Okay, we will leave now but see on on 28th! - See you, bye. Appu, take badam milk. You made badam milk, mom? What's the occasion? Nothing much, you are working day and night, no time for us. Hence I got something to drink for you. I need to work 24/7 to bring my family up. When you brought badam milk, I thought there is some matter. it's just that I heard things about a certain girl who runs an old age home. What is happening? Are you in love? I don't know if it's love, but I definitely feel something. Appu, I say this from my life experience. There is a world of difference between love and attraction. If you like someone for their good qualities, it's nothing but attraction. But if you accept someone for their good and bad, that's love! It's easy to get attracted to someone, but if it's love, be careful okay? Okay, since we are talking about love, In fact let me ask you something. Go ahead. Have you ever loved anybody in all these years? It's funny that you are asking me a question that your grandfather should have asked me. I don't know if I have ever been in love but yes I have been attracted to someone. Oh, is it? You can ask this to old generation. Almost everyone got arranged marriage. Everyone has the same answer. Your father was not the one I wanted to marry. Not because he is a bad person.. but simply because there are other good people out there too. Have you not shared this with anyone before? No. Back then it was different. In our times we didn't have options. You have the luxury of meeting, getting to know a person of your choice you marry the person of your choice. You also have the choice of divorcing if things don't work out. But it was different for us. Can I decide what you have to wear for the rest of your life? It's like that. I will not interfere in your love life. But, you have my permission to seek love. Thank you, Mom. One.. Why do they fear you so much? Is it? - They tremble at your sight and run away. Impressive, huh? But you were not that impressive yesterday why did you go into reverse gear? Yesterday, for the first time I really fell in love. What about all the other times then? Just asking. - This is pure love. Is that a heart or ladies beauty parlour?! Frequently women keep walking in and walking out, you see! This time it's fixed. She's the one for me, she will be the mother of my kids. If you are so sure about her, why didn't you tell her so yesterday? As you know my friend, I don't exactly have a reputable past. What if a well wisher from the company sang glorious praises about my past to her? So I'm being a bit cautious. True that. Now where will you find a grandfather for yourself? How will I find a grandfather? How about your.. - He's 91.. How about yours? - 2000. Hello, good morning, sir. - Good.. Grandpa! I extend a warm welcome to all the participants of this year's Swayamvara. The highest scorer in every contest will be selected for the final round. Who the hell is Munniswamy? It's me, ma'am. What sort of rubbish have you written in sex coloumn? I have written that I'll try, ma'am. Age related constraints, correct ma'am? You were expected to answer male or female! You are rejected. - Get lost. Is it you, Ramu? Yes, Elizabeth. Wait a minute, we don't have the time for a long flashback. Keep it short. Our story has progressed from.. Nick name to surname, for sure it is true love. At least now tell me those three magical words. Take care and play. Yes. Who was that Elizebeth? My old boyfriend. Ma'am, we are here. What took you so long? Decorate the trees with the lights. Ahhh? - Okay. Ma'am, it's us. Hi! - Hi. - You? We have registered our grandfather's name for the competition. Okay, but what are you both doing here? Ma'am, can I speak to you in private? That's a bad pick up line! I already have a boyfriend. Thank you, Goddess! Yes! That's okay. A cute girl like you deserves another boyfriend! The boon was blessed to him, I will not request in the future. This is the first round of Swayamvara.. I will never forget you.

I am tired helping him. Will he win? There should be a way to make him win. Whatever we try he won't win. No way. My head is already spinning. Hi. - Hi, take this. Didn't I tell you, bro? Eventually the girl will accept. I like the old school love letter approach. It shows you are traditional. And this is for you. Is this love towards me as well? Shut up and sign. - Sign? It's an organ donation form, after you die the functional parts of your body will be given to those who need it. They can get a new life, at least they can be given life. In a way, every boy from Karnataka is an organ donor. Huh? - Yeah. We give our heart to girls even when they don't ask for it. We'll give away our entire body parts that too in a jiffy. Give it to me.. Thank you. What about you? My name is Mukesh. From my childhood I have had a hole in my heart. tar in my liver and stone in my kidney. Do you still require it? Are you still alive? - Shut up and sign! Okay, okay. Just a minute. I hope the organs will be scooped after my death? Sure. - Okay, take it. See you. Scooped? Under any circumstance, I want Ramu to win the Swayamvara. Mom? He is my first love. First love or last love, all are the same! I don't care what you do, he should win. Otherwise, in spite of being a diabetic I'll eat one whole tub of ice cream and die! Headache! Now we are in the third round. Lemon rice, lemon rice. This is a simple round. Evryone needs to tell how lemon rice is made? Fine bye, come on, let's go. - Hey, why? This is exactly what he will say now.. - What? Add rice to the cooker. Very easy. Add rice to the cooker. What did I tell you? Sorry. Wash the rice first and then add coriander, curry leaves, onions and tomato. Then squeeze lemon and close the cooker lid. Yeah! Cooker will blast! Listen to me, he is not reliable. - Excuse me! Please step aside, I want to talk to you. Okay, she wants to talk to me it seems, step aside. Not you brother, you come. - Brother? - Me? What have you taken me for? I don't accept this. Shhh shhh. - I am here to play fair and square. What shh shhh? If anybody bothers you with questions like those just let me know okay? It won't turn into a problem, right? I am the one who usually creates problems. But I'm on your side. So there won't be any problems. You want my grandpa to win, isn't that so? I will make sure he does. - Okay. Stop! - Do you want grandpa to win or not? Okay I'll hold your finger. I saw it. The final round is called hide and seek. In this round participants will be blindfolded. Friends, on the other side there will be girls standing. Who will hold the bride hand and recognise her they will be the winner. Whoever wins gets hundred points So lets start hide and seek. 'The girl who opposed has proposed now' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'She wants to marry me, you know' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'Behind her I went and got drugged' 'Today she has opened her heart to me' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'Last year I saw this year at the fair' 'I fell for her when I saw her playing swing' 'Last year I saw this year at the fair' 'I fell for her when I saw her playing swing' 'I had challenged my friends' 'That I would make her fall for me' 'Made fun of guys and impressed her' 'Feels like a Ladu has fallen into my mouth from nowhere' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'The girl who opposed has proposed now' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'She tattooed my name on her hand' 'She's carved 'YES' big like a rangoli' 'My heart is happy and warm as ever' 'I'll go on a fast for her every Saturday' 'The result of virtuous deeds of my previous lives That's how I got her in this life' 'She escaped a thousand eyes to come to me' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'The girl who opposed has proposed now' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' 'She wants to marry me, you know' 'Giccha Gili Gili My life's the finest there is' Hey, out! What's all this? A girl has fallen for him and the duet song is also over. What are you doing? Wait up, bro. Sorry, God. Let's first feed him the goodies and when he's eaten a bit too much we will sit back and have fun watching him get the loosies! Wait and watch. Not this watch, the other one.. Sir, it is being speculated that the fire mishap that happened yesterday at KR Mills is not an accident. What are your thoughts on it? All this is part of politics. People politicize everything. They never feel others' misery unless something similar happens to them. I don't indulge in rumors, instead let's talk about how I plan on helping the victims. I will be giving 2 lakh rupees to every victims' family. Are you giving this to the families of all the 15 victims? The death toll is not 15. It's 16.. The police have found another dead body today morning. Is he the villian? - No. It's his dad. Show me the villian. - Play the villain music. The supreme court has intervened I now cannot contest in the upcoming by-election because of the ongoing bribery case. My responsibility as the alumni head comes to an end this year few days ago who passed away by a tragedy our friend Kokila Mohan.. We have decided to build a block in the name of our friend. At the same time it's difficult to make a new candidate contest and win. I have finished my term. My responsibilities will be handled to the next one. We need a powerful candidate. He is a gold medalist in Political Science, Harvard University. I will back him up. He will be an able representative. Even though he had several opportunities in American, he left them. Politics is like snake and ladder game. He gave it all up to come back to our nation and to serve our own people. Like a mongoose he will climb the ladder and kill the snake. So let's welcome Shashank Radhakrishna on stage please. Did you recognize me? I know you are my junior. In the college during the speech..? With the script? It's not you? Guess, there is some confusion. Anyways, thanks for coming. Good Luck. See you soon. Okay. Take care. Nothing is an accident, nothing is forgotten either. I have waited for this day for years. The real game begins now. You are waking up to some good news. My dad's back from the US. I have told him about us, he's got no problem with it. He wants to meet you once. So prep yourself and come to Coffee Day at sharp 10. Okay, Coffee Day. Hi, father- in- law, I am Appu. I work for a software company as an HR. Sir, my name is Appanna.. No, it's tasteless. Oops! Why did this moron come here? It'll all be over if he finds out I am in love now. Why is he here? Hope he doesn't find out about my daughter's love. Come back later, I am waiting for for someone. He has sent you a note. Hi! - Hi, Dad. This is my dad. Dad, after these incidents, how can we go further. Do you know why I was okay with you being in love without asking any further questions? Because I thought you make better decisions than me. But I was wrong. If you are adamant about marrying him, go ahead. But I won't be okay with it. I want a son, not a son-in- law... There is more to it.. Dad, please let's stop the argument. He has loved me for a year, but you have loved me for 25 years. Even after 10 years, your love will be more. Every girl's first hero is her dad. This wedding will happen only with your permission.. Listen up, it's your responsibility to make my dad like you. I'll be waiting outside. My goodness. I am happy now. My daughter has got a proposal from an ex minister's son. But that's not the bad news, the bad news is that they are investing in your company. Even that's not bad news enough their only condition to invest is to kick you out of the company. Unbelievable? I'll call them, talk to them. Hello.. - Hi, sir. Based on few complaints by employees the new CEO ordered you terminated. I'm sorry, sir. I just nodded my head and they have printed the invitation cards. He is 1000 times better than you. You prove me that you're one percent better than him in anything. Then let's think about it, see you. Oh, I forgot. I am just a girl's father. I can do only this much, see you. For the hero of a college only the heroine knows about him. But the villian of the college is known by everyone in the college. So I was kind of a bad boy. Everyone hated us in college. We hated lovers. So we found a game to split lovers. That day I got hold of Shashank Radhakrishan. In in the midst of so many girls the contest was to find out who his girlfriend was. But unfortunately.. I wouldn't have minded if you had insulted me but you insulted my love. I will teach you a lesson. Sorry, we don't attend those classes. You will fall in love one day. She will your life and I will come for you. I dare you to marry the one you love. Was the invitation card proper? Let me know if there are any corrections I'll correct it send it to you. See Appu, I am back. You won't find a job as I have black listed you in every IT company. You don't even have the wealth to start a business because you are from middle class. You can steal or do anything illegal.. You're a middle class man and leading a respectful life means everything to your kind! So I gave it a good thought and decided to give you a peon job in my office. Here, take this card. Keep it carefully. Don't lose it, you know. You have been having a bad time. You will find people who will set the watch right, not the time. See you. Sorry.. I keep meeting you. As I am jobless, I was thinking about my career too. I wondered if I should open a departmental store. A tea shop may be or a food kiosk to impress my father-in-law? But you are right about middle class mentality. Our problem is we have grown up to embrace compromises. Our wallets are filled with papers and not money. We have more debts than assets. We like an item based on its price. And we order the dish looking at its cost. All the hard work and effort if we find a girl a rich brat waltz in and tries to steal the girl. Think you can get away with it? I suffered 10 years to see you suffer. You want revenge. I want to impress my father-in-law and get the girl what to do. Oh yeah! You are contesting the elections right? I will contest from the same area as you and win the elections. What if you don't win? In that case I swear I'll make sure you also don't win. And what if you don't succeed in that? Then I'll be your best man at your wedding. This is not child's play, this is politics! You are after all middleclass. Bro. You should know something about us middle class people then. We may not do things that are expected of us. We like to do things that people say we cannot! How about a little trivia for you? 50 percent of our population is middle class. So. I am already in the majority. Bye for now. I will come in every era to reestablish dharma and love. Take a short break. Krishna, popcorn? - Hey, its a break time. Are you happy now? So you somehow managed to get Radha to stand beside you? Krishna, I'll directly come to the point. See, I don't want to be at logger heads with you. So why don't we reach a compromise? Like you know, I've to live to the hype which I gave before the interval. It's the question of heroism and my reputation also. You only have to save me. Come on now, Krishna! It's not like you are my girlfriend and you are trying to take revenge for something I did or said. At least you tell him to be nice to me, Radha. Please Krishna, please accept my apologies and indicate in some way that you are on my side. Sir, we have arranged a send off party for you. Can you please come and cut the cake. Sure, definitely. Krishna, please help me, please. Hi. You know, I mean.. Mr Appana.. You must be wondering why no one is coming forward to take the cake. Well, this is what you have earned in this company over the years! What matters more is not what you say when in front of someone but what you say behind their back! Neither wealth nor looks define a man's worth. What matters most is his personality! Sir, I heard you have plans of entering politics after quitting this job. Al the best. 350 employees of this company are eligible to vote for you but of course none of us will! You all must be wondering why I am eating this cake. My teacher used to say. You don't have to teach insects to imbibe their natural characteristics. But when it comes to humans, well, even if a lifetime is spent teaching us how to be humane, not every time do we succeed in doing so! And going by how you all behaved today, looks like he was absolutely right! You see those boys there? They were appointed during the time of recession. Despite them, being mechanical engineers they were offered a job in an IT company! Just because your HR was concerned about their future as it was already three years since they had completed engineering and they were jobless in spite of being capable. He ensured that they were hired. So ya, that's one mistake your HR made! Now, let's come to this girl. Her mother was admitted to a hospital last month. Her medical insurance had expired, but the company took care of the bills. How? After finding out that her mother was a single parent he bore all the medical expenses. When I asked him why he was bending the rules, he simply said he would have done the same for his family. This was his other mistake! Yes, he is erred a couple of times. But then again is there anyone here, who has not made mistakes at all? Listen, it's still okay if you don't get the best employee awards. But do strive harder to become good human beings first. No need for so much drama! Then even I'll get emotional Even I know, I haven't been all that nice to you. Sir, it's not like we have been on our best behaviour either! We had something to tell you. What? Sir, book a cab for yourself today. Don't take your car, please. Cab? Why? - Yes. The thing is, to show our lovers for you. We messed with your break cable! That's why you should listen to us when we ask you to do something. You loafers! Look who is here, the future MLA of Malleshwaram, Appanna of course! Are you belittling me? - Not at all. Listen! - What? You have turned a blind eye to your reality for the sake of your unattainable dreams! Have you lost it? I mean who quits a job that offers security and a decent salary to enter politics! Which idiot pushed you into taking this irrational decision? That Sreenivas Murthy had called me earlier What did he say? - What else will he say? He wanted the wedding to be pushed to next year! That's for the best! - What? So that means... Okay! So the fact that my wedding has been pushed is bothering you No. Yes, but not the fact that I have quit my job! Exactly! Grrrr.. Look at my bad luck! Till now not a single arranged marriage in my family had been cancelled but now thanks to you. As if yours is a very prestigious family! - What did you say? I said, my God what a well respected family ours is! Hey! I want to ask you a question. - What? This idea of a political career came out of the blue. What prompted you? I hope you are not planning some sort of financial scam! Why will anyone aspire to become a politician? To do social service of course! Of course. He is my son. Wait and watch how he will earn more respect that you did. I am watching already! Your friends from the old age home are here to see you. They are talking to Ranveer on the terrace. Son, why have you gathered people aged 65-70 on the terrance? Hello, they are my friends. - Friends? - Yes. They? - Yes. I spoke to one person. He was your grandfather's physics teacher. So his physique has become weak. Why do you want such friends? Hello, please don't insult my friends. Mom, talk some sense to him. - Okay, you go. Hi, hi, hi.. Is the sweet tasty? - Yes. All this while you were blabbering, now that he is here, ask him only. Our girl likes you. You also like her - Correct. That's what matters. So, what I am saying is who cares what her father thinks?! Also he is not her only father! - What? We all are her fathers too! Hello, you don't have to agree on everything! Listen darling, we need to respect blood ties at the end of the day. I didn't mean it in the wrong way. - Then? I was trying to say that we all think of her as our daughter. You should have worded it right then! Appu! - Yes, uncle? - Don't you worry! - Okay, uncle. We will make sure you win the elections with top results. - Thank you, uncle. Right on top? - Yes. - That too because of you guys? - Yes. Darling, drop that walking stick on the ground. Why? - First do as I say, I'll explain. Great! Now try picking it from the ground with the same vigor, let's see! Ha? You are challenging me to pick this up? This stick, that's it! Ya, so do the needful. You can do it uncle. Come on. - You can do it. Be careful. Sir, you can do it. Watch it. Sit him down carefully. Sit down. You can't even lift a stick up. But here you are claiming that you'll help him win an election. Listen to me. Don't depend on them to win, you'll fall flat. Hey, Ranchod Singh! It's Ranveer Singh! I'll hit you if you don't get my name right! Whatever! We are not old, we are experienced. Yes! - Oh! Appu, you do know that experience is not something that can be bought even if you want to right? If you believe in our experience.. Trust us and we will win this together. What is it that a political leader should know first and foremost? What? He/she should know why they want to lead. If you want to win with a majority, you should become popular in this area. Well, by winning the hearts of women and they like two things. What are those? Saris and serials! Dude, this serial gets the highest TRPs. - Is it? (A dialogue from a famous TV show) Not only women support required, we need youth power. For youth we have organized a cricket tournament. While 20 percent of the votes come from women. - Correct. Another 20 percent will be that of youngsters. - Yes. However, drunkards will constitute 50 percent of your vote bank! You wanted me to develop an app that benefits alcoholics, right? Here it is, the name of the app is a winner in itself. Students preparing for exams need motivation more than preparations! This app will provide information on all the routes where police are waiting. Anyone can update this info on the app. You are the one who has acted in that popular Kannada serial right? Of course, that's me. You want to take a picture with me? People should think of you as a hero. Sit down dad! One more six! Sir, ever since your son has started those motivational classes we all have lost our peace of mind. Why, what has he done now? Shankrappa, I'm waiting from 10 pm. and we have not registered a single drunk and drive case! Has there been a decrease in the number of drunkards? No sir. I went and checked out the parking lots of a couple of bars. All of them are full. - Is it? So I wonder why we can't spot the same vehicles on the roads! I don't need a photo with you. In that serial, you are saying that you will take that innocent girl to Sri Lanka with you! That apart I own a 3 BHK house in Sadashivnagar. - Okay. And yet, my son goes and sleeps on the footpaths in Majestic! Why, all the rooms in your house, are taken is it? If asked he says, he wants to become like actor Yash, who came up the hard way! Stop this guy! Stop. - Take the vehicle key first. Sir, thanks to low battery, my phone switched off! Or else I would have never taken this route! My brother passed out of SSLC with a distinction but he refused to attend his PUC board exams. When I asked him, he said Mark Zuckerberg also dropped out of college. So like him I'll also discontinue studies and start something like Facebook! Tell me what's going on? If you are honest with me, I'll let you go Sir, there is an app on my phone - Ha.. It's called Theertha Yatra. Vote it seems, vote! You think he will go easy on us if I tell him that you are an MLA candidate? Just not mine, I'll make sure no one else in this area also votes for you! I will ensure that not a single person from police department votes for you! The reason to lose this match was Appanna hence he might not get votes from youth. Usually people come to a stadium to watch their favourite team win. But I'm here to celebrate your defeat! Dad, let's go. - You keep quiet. You know, the idea of a cat feeling and looking like a lion when it stares at its reflection in the mirror works well only as facebook memes! Symbolically speaking.. If my daughter is the IPL trophy you are R C B! Darling, you console him and come. I'll wait for you in the car. Life? Okay Did I or my father told to take up this challenge and that he'd get us married only if you win the election? You brought this upon yourself. What can I do? His family has been involved in politics for over 25 years now. And you? You have no experience whatsoever! The thing about this society is that, the moment someone attempts to attempt something new it burdens them with comparisons! Let's say someone is thinking of floating a start up they say not everyone can be a Steve Jobs! If you say you want to open a petrol bunk they ask if we think we are Ambanis. If we want to start a transport business they say not everyone can be where VRL is! We are used to hearing this from our childhood. I guess this is why a lot of Shankar Nags do not go beyond sitting outside the theatres. And many Rajinikanths remain bus conductors! I don't know why I am entering politics. It could be for me, you, our love or society at large. But I have decided to go ahead so there is no going back no matter what But do you think you can handle the way in which this society will treat you in case you lose this election? You can't really sit and ponder too much over what people will think. I would rather focus on how to work towards my goal. Also that's way better than making fun of others like what your father is doing! This is getting personal! I'm getting personal? Okay, the other day in the cafe your father asked me to be 10%, no 100% better that the other guy. You also walked away saying it was up to me to figure out a way to impress him. Once we decide we want something, we go after it come what may. Go advice and console your father. All this happened because of you only. Your ideas screwed everything up Hello! I was not the one who gave that serial idea? His serial idea hardly did any damage. Everything went for a toss becuase of his cricket idea! You son... Because of your idea we failed! What did you just say? Did you just abuse me and my son! You know what, right back at you and your son! Listen up, sisters, why are you both cussing at each other like this? Like you don't know? Tell him. When you young people fight, you curse at each others' parents right? Likewise we cuss at each others' children! Correct! Thank you for your kind response. Please sit. I don't know about you guys but despite all this chaos, I am very happy today. Why? Finally someone followed me back on Twitter. - Like really!? Look at him contemplating his next move all alone. It's time for you guys to stop the blame game and find a solution Sir, we have fixed the water filter Who do I give the bill to? Give it to him. - Sir, bill What's it man? - They are not willing to buy the water filter, Boss. Tell them you'll give them a free one month product demo. Then they'll accept. But won't you incur a loss if you offer free services for a month? Sir, we are a new company, so I'm doing this to market my product. Please call me if you want any more products I'll provide you with the best service. Friends, we are a new company too, right? So why not offer free demo service to gain people's trust then? Demo? - Yes. Hello everybody, welcome to today's press meet. I'm here today to announce that for the first time in the history of Indian politics I will be trying out the demo MLA concent in my constituency. And what do you mean by Demo MLA, sir? Now when you go to a car show room, you ask for a test drive and only if you like the driving experience will you buy it. Same goes with phones. You check for all its features before buying it. Likewise, before I become an MLA I would want to put my working style out there for people to see. I want people to vote in my favour only if they are convinced of my commitment. Moreover for the first time we will be opening a 24/7 helpline. People can use it to register their complaints. That's my scooter, sir. Please help me find it. If you succeed, I'll ensure that my entire family votes for you. Rai was very close to my father, he passed away recently. Otherwise we could have seeked help from him. No, he was Pai. It's been five years since they have put tar on our road, sir. My son broke his arm from a cycle fall because of these uneven roads. We dont have enough money with us. How can we tar every road? Uncle, my friends make fun of me because my dad takes bribe. It will be beneficial for them, let him take. Can't you all give some ideas! You seem to be struggling a lot. I've brought my contacts. Contacts? - My fellows. They love me from school. I maintain a bunch of guys. During Ganesh festival, the norm is to collect funds to keep an idol and celebrate. Yes. - But for a change.. Dad, sign my marks card please. This time we will go door-to-door and collect funds as usual but will use the proceeds to repair the roads. People urinate on our road, it's become like a public toilet! Please give a solution for that, sir. We will do as you say. If it's going to benefit the nation and society even in the smallest of ways We will join hands and work on it right away. No matter how hard I try, I am unable to land myself a job, guruji. Your problems are not getting solved because you urinate and spit in public. We don't have a Math teacher at our governement school. How can we do something that government is supposed to do? Please help us, brother. I have created an app called Book My Class. Through this app, anyone can teach anything from anywhere. (Teaching Maths through online education app) This is a sacred place. It is beleived that Lord Ram once passed through this place. No more bribes I'll take here on, my child. Excuse me, Are you in love with her? - Bro, it's not what it looks like. We are not a lovey dovey couple like Shivarajkumar and Bhavana. All that's in the past. Now our relationship is pure and platonic like that of Shivarajkumar and Radhika's. I don't care if she is Bhavana or Radhika. But how dare you compare yourself to our beloved Shivanna? Let's go. Whether people do this for themselves or in name of God if this helps our country, that's enough. Sir, not only mine, entire my family, friends vote to you. You can become a good leader in the future!! Demo MLA who has created history. Who will people support? Independent candidate Appanna? Or ex-minister's son Shashank Radhakrisha? Watch election fever. Tonight at 8. His dad is strict. He doesn't like love and love marriage. I forgot to ask, do you know cooking? Anu! - No we are traditional family, that's why I asked. Monkey! Leave her, do you know cooking? I know. In the Kesaribath that you are eating how many spoons of maida should you add? Three. - Three? In Kesaribath, they don't add maida they add rice, am I, right? Your son has reached marriage age. With great difficulty I have made love to her. At my current age, it is really difficult to find a better looking girl. Dont reject her please as she doesnt know cooking. Okay.. Where is uncle? Him? Naani Naani... Who are you? Uncle, I am Anu's friend. How come you came so early? You keep quite. Who are you? Uncle, I am Anu's friend. There will be grown-up boys, what work you have here? When I was going to college, One guy was troubbling me hence Anu asked me to come here Who was the one forcing you to love him? Come, show me. Hey, We have a son, he will take care, you get relaxed. Appu.. - Not Appu, Appanna. Appanna.. - Yes, Dad. Love her. - What! Love her. - Okay. Some boys are troubling her to love her, please see who are those. Okay, Dad. Hey, come here, how will you go? 2 wheeler, Dad. Don't want, there are loads of humps in this area. Go in 4 wheeler. What you said? What did I say? Your lips are closed, from where the sound was coming. Hey, take vehicle key, go and come fast. Dad, what's special today? Hey, today it's special day, come. What's special day? Today is the the day I saw you and I fell. What's so special? How come you came early today? - Why any problem? No problem. No problem, we are happy. I got surprised. Today is a special day. What it is? Today is Rakhshabandhana. Rakhshabandhana. so nice. On this auspicious day, sisters tie the rakhi to all their brothers and ask them to protect them for entire their life. Wow! - Wait.. - Tie it. Wait, always you tie, today let her tie. What! Why should she tie? Wait, every year she ties it to me. She has already tied today to her bother Why should she tie it to me now? Shut up. Yes, we need change - You want protection, right? You might get a terrible husband. He will be you good brother. Understood? Tie this. Go on, tie it. Jeez, I'll prepare the stand. You keep quiet. Do whatever you want. - You tie. Wait, one second. Let me put a song according to the situation. Aruna, even if we try again we can't give birth to such kids. Why are you staring at me? Look at the cute sister you've got. Go on, tie it. What happened? - The power went off. - Power went off? This mischievous guy is sitting next to that cute girl. And the power has gone. Hey, Aruna. What happened? Check the power. Did she tie it? I'm satisfied now. Take her now. - Okay. Hey, you're taking her in a car, right? Yes, that's what you told me. Let her sit at the back. Why? - Where would she sit on a motorbike? On the back? - Follow the same now. Oh, logic? Remember, if you are loafer.. Sir, there is no one in the opponent who is strong. However our independent Appanna is most popular on social media. How can you say that? Sir, to become popular polititian, these 4 points are very important. 1. Public Image 2. Public Behaviour 3. Connection with the voters 4. Background of the candidate Now apply these points to Appanna's behavious. Because of Demo MLA concept, he has gained popularity. He has a good public image. Excuse me, sir. The four qualities that you mentioned are not at all important for one to become a politician! The most important trait of a politician 5. Oratory skills! Didn't get it? Then tune into News First channel at 9 pm. You'll understand. (News First channel jingle plays out) Hello everybody, you are watching 'Demo Politics', a News First special. and I'm your host Sommana Machimada. On tonight's show, I have with me CM candidate, Shashank Radhakrishnan. Welcome to the my show, sir. Hello. Sir, your opponent Appanna is becoming viral on social media due to his Demo MLA concept. Your thoughts on that? Sir, Indian politics needs a lot of drama. Here gimmicks take precedence over real issues For instance, a certain someone reports to the police about a stolen bike. This person calls Appanna also regarding the stolen bike. Team Appanna finds the bike within an hour even. Everybody is happy and #Demo MLA starts trending on Facebook and Twitter But if you think a little logically about it you will start to wonder how an entire police force could not do in one week was accomplished by these people in just a matter of an hour? Does this mean, they in someway know these theives or are they the theives themselves?! I really don't get this. Fair point! Let's assume you're right But What about collecting funds for road repairs instead of sepnding it on religious festivities. That needs to be appreciated, right? See, let's say you need a minimum of 30-35 lakh rupees to construct a one km stretch of road. And they collected 10 lakh rupees each from 8 wards for this purpose. Total funds will amount to 80 lakh rupees. I'm now curious to find out where the remaining 45 lakhs went? But this is not the shocker! The minimum thickness of any road should be 225 mm. I found out that the thickness was 150 mm only. This only means that it hasn't even costed them 35 lakh rupees to build those roads! I have seen people turn scamsters after coming to power. But this is the first time that someone managed to scam people even before coming to power! I just applaud his brilliance! So, this is what ministerial candidate, Shashank Radhakrishna had to say about his opponent, Appanna's Demo MLA concept. As for the result of the election, looks like we will have to wait and watch whom the public opinion will favour! Thank you for watching News First a channel that's committed to keeping you updated. Accused of corruption even before coming to power Malleshwaram candidate Appanna. In yesterday's incident, Appanna and his team were arrested by the police. Is demo MLA is a scam? Watch tonight at 8. Dear. This is the first time that someone from our family has been arrested. What makes it worse is the fact that he is a son of a teacher! We will talk to him once he comes home All this is happening because of your bad parenting. Sir, is this Appu bro's house? - What? - Appu bro? - Yes Is he here? - No, he's gone out. Please give this to him when he is back. What is this? My parents are cobblers. They have a small shop near the bustand. They, however, want me to become a succesful officer. But I go to a government school and we never had access to a Math teacher. But we were able to learn from one thanks to Appu's Book My Class app. I passed out with a distinction and I am not the only student who benefitted from this. When I told all this to my father, he wanted to thank Appu by giving this. I'll take leave from you now, sir. You know in all these years that I have been a teacher. Not a single student of mine has ever gifted me anything like this! Go get my bag for me. Why? - I will go and get that photo frame I broke fixed. Appanna, Appanna, Appanna.. I was expecting to meet you in the Assembly. But fate always has its own plans for us and here I am meeting you, in a jail! I actually feel sorry for you. You are unable to get a hold of politics on one hand and are on the verge of losing the love of your life on the other! You really think these oldies will help you swim against the tide? You really think you can defeat me? Let me tell you something. Even though the race is between a tortoise and a hare it's the lion that is declared a winner and that my friend is called politics! Plus if you have to win against a lion like me, you got be akin to a tiger at least. But for me, you are nothing more than a mosquito that I can kill in a second! Anyway I came here for a reason. It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm throwing a party. As part of the celebrations, I'll be announcing my wedding date. You can't stop the wedding, of course. What you all can however, do is to shower your blessings on me from here only! Last but not the least. Just because you were popular in college doesn't mean that you will become a mass leader now! They have done up the place really well. Dad, you should have spoken to me before saying okay to this. They said they will just make an announcement about your wedding as part of the celebrations. it's not like there is going to be an engagement ceremony or anything. Dad, you know I like Appu. What will I tell him when he hears about this and confronts me? They have assured me that they won't make it official until the elections are over. This party is being thrown for their close circle only, so don't worry. I'm sure paneer butter masala and carrot halwa are a part of the menu. Let's go enjoy the food Paneer, it seems! You only go eat! Hear me out! Good evening. We are here to celebrate my birthday. but what's even more special about this evening is the fact that candidates who are contesting against me in the election also here today. This shows that we are not rivals but only opponents who are running in the same race to win a cup. Only one person is awarded the first rank in an exam But this does not mean the other students who don't get the top marks will detest him, right? Likewise, there can be only one winner in this election and whoever that is Only one will win. We will congratulate him and support him. Let's all come together and support him in building a healthy society. There is something else that I want to share with you today. I'll be getting married right after the elections are over. My engagement cards have been place on your tables. Please do take a look. 'Engagement ceremony of APPANNA & ABHIGNYA' Hi, there! - Hi! I'm sure you are shocked to see us here. The point was to shock you with our presence at your own birthday party. Of course, it was your government that sent us to jail. Despite that we were released and naturally you want to know how so let's cut to the flashback. What's a central minister doing here? Good evening, madam. - Who asked you to arrest them? How dare you! Release them immediately. Let them out. - Quick! Do that right away Thank you, so much, madam Thanks, darling. - Happy? Don't forget to call me later, okay? Had I not told you, that someone started following me on Twitter? None of you bothered to check who it was. Anyway, she is the one and she is my ex! How was the twist? If your hold is on the local government our reach is up to the central government! Shashank, Shashank, Shashank.. Guys, was my base voice up to the mark? - Make it a bit deeper please. - Okay. You are in such a sorry state Better now? - Ya, maintain this pitch. You are in a spot where you can neither express your frustration nor can you win the girl over. You may be the most powerful person. but that does not mean, you can control what's going to happen next! The playing field may be different, but even you know I'm good at this game and it's only a matter of time before I master it! And yes, you may be the lion and I may look like a mosquito from where you stand. But remember this, a lion can't irritate a mosquito as much as a mosquito can irritate a lion! I think I have spoken enough, shall we leave? Just one more dialogue please. Last but not the least.. I may be good enough to become a class leader only. I don't intend to be a mass leader either. For mass is temporary but class. That's permanent! Bye now! So how was my entry? - Super. - Thanks a lot! Father-in-law dearest, was that impressive enough for you? The race has already started and you are still standing here and seeking my approval! Tell me something, are you really confident of winning this election? Father-in-law, what matters is not who starts the race first but who touches the end line first! I right, my love? Bye, Father-in-law - Bye. Okay guys, let's change our strategy from today onwards. What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say China? Of course, it's population. They are ahead of us in terms of population. They are way ahead of us when it comes to technology. Correct. Forget the technology, they were the ones who brought Corona! Correct. And this is the answer I've been waiting for. A person's good deeds lasts only until he does something bad. But looks like the best thing to do now is to think how to make him lose! Is that even a possibility? There are four ways to make a person lose. 1. Public image We should damage his public image. 2. Public behaviour. We should do something that people will land up questioning his character. 3. Public interaction Meaning the connection with the public.. - Not mine.. Should be cut. 4. Background of the candidate. Where ever public sees him, they should hit him. We have to completely destroy his name and connections, understood? Okay, I'll explain. We have to break the bowler's hand because we cannot bat! Now do you understand? And this is how you should do it! All this seems fine. But I still feel something is missing I know what it is. A good title for our operation. I'll come up with a good one. Wait, Take a step back. I will not accept this title. Everyone has used this title. You do not understand, For taking revenge this is good title. Whatsoever, I will not agree Is it... Shashank.. Hey, wait! Shashank, it seems! Vishnu sir, with your permission, please, sorry. Start background music. 'Ex minister's son misbehaves with an elderly lady.' Why did you have to get into a fight with someone who is as old as your grandmother? 'A grandmother's story.' Nonsense! Mom, do you even know what happened there? Greetings. I want to talk to you privately. Why not? Please come. How can I help you? Dear Shashank, I am unable to eat from the time I have set my eyes on you. Intially I thought it's because of gastric. But later I figured it's love. What is this? Love letter. I fell in love with you at the very instance I saw you. That's why I've written a love letter. That too using my blood, just for you. What nonsense is this? Are you in your right mind? Didn't you find anyone else to play with? In serials, you are okay with an old man falling in love with a young girl and marrying her! But in real life when an older woman likes a young boy why is it not okay? I don't want love or anything, Take this. Hey, please... - Leave me alone. - Please understand me. Please, I love you! I pleaded with him to help me with my pension. I literally begged him but such was his insensitivity to my problem that he tore the letter and walked away. Make way. What happened to my ears? I can't hear a thing - What? I can't hear you! - I can hear you. You can hear me? - Don't shout I can hear you. Is it just me who can't hear? Maybe I have become deaf We are practicing for our next operation. Who's getting an operation done? - Our next operation! What? Operation Shhhh. Shhhh?! Okay, Shhhh. Excuse me.. - Yes, sir. - ..can we start the programme? We are expecting another guest, sir. You'll have to wait for five minutes, sir. if you don't mind.. Oh, okay. Sir, if you don't mind, can you stand up for the guest? You expect me stand up because of him? No way! Shashank who misbehaved with an old lady yesterday has gotten into trouble yet again. We are breaking this exclusive news at 8 pm. Shashank is big headed. Why? What happened? Watch this. Was Shashank disrespecting the national anthem by sitting down while others stood up to show their respect? What kind of culture is this? Come, let's ask. 'Shashank misbehaves with an old lady.' 'Shashank disrespects national anthem! Breaking News' Listen, Shashank, your dad is not as good you think he is. Sorry. I will take care of things going further. Don't worry. No. This can't be happening... This should not be happening. What should not happen? Radhakrishna is providing a fan, TV, fridge and five thousand cash to the homes of every voter. Let us also give. - Okay okay. If we sell yours and mine and everyone's eyes, kidneys and liver we will be able to generate over 25 lakh rupees tops! And what do you think you can you provide with that money other than peanuts? I said let's give. Let's not give too much. - Then? Let's give 10 TVs, 10 cookers and 10 fans. In that case we also will get two, three, four or five votes only! That brings us to our final operation. What? Operation Drone Pratap! So this is product number one. Do you know this? - Of course.. This is a tape recorder You insert a cassette and listen to devotional songs. What else? It's just a fan. But this is a special fan. - What's special? At level one you can eliminate humidity. - At level two it will eliminate the person? Exactly! Oh goodness! Is it so? - Yes. Product number 2. Pressure cooker. At three whistles, you'll get food. At four whistles, you will become food for the worms. And finally.. - Please. Let me guess. TV? Yes. You are getting smarter. - Thank you. In our TV, we just provide one channel. Which movies? - Only devotional movies. Screw the elections. Please keep aside a couple of it for me also. I will beat you to pulp. At least save one for me. So these are the special products we are providing to gain votes. People don't vote for functional products these days who will vote for us if you give scrap products. The sole reason of giving is to make people not to vote. What do you mean? Please explain clearly If we give the cooker this way, it becomes a problem for us. What if we give this the other way? It becomes problematic for them. So, what happens to those ten thousand cookers if we give out ten cookers like this? Means a major flop case! Look, none of them from our generation has managed to make such an impact. Come, sit. There are already so many fans. - Yes. I cannot imagine how many more fans I'll make after the elections.. I doubt if you'll be available to catch up with us once it's over. Oh goodness! Enough already. This is just a show off. These people are paid to act in such a way, Appu.. - Fire, mom, fire.. What? - Nothing. I am asking them to get fire and cake. Hurry up, man. Bring it fast. Let's start it. Light up. - Happy anniversary! Dad, what do have against love marriages? Love marriage, huh! Look at the guy sitting at that table. What? - It seems like he's been in love for 18 years. His face is as blank as a pumpkin. He's lost clarity in life. You tell me, do think any boy is happy in love? Many people are happy. - Show me anyone. Sir, you are Appu Anna right? Yeah.. - Hey, call him Appanna, what is that Appu Anna? Leave him, you tell me. Sir, it's me Madesh. When I was in final year college, I fell in love with a girl called Aishu. You helped me in getting married. Madesh, hope you doing well. With your help, we got married and living happilly Super super Sir, in this bill, do not pay the GST amount I will talk to the owner and provide you a discount. Hey, those formalities not required. Please sir, for my happiness. - Yes, thank you. Lion.. How was it? Mom, we got discount on GST. - This is his set up. Didn't he told not to pay GST. He would have paid him earlier including GST. Excuse me. Sir, are you Prof. Narayan? - Yes. It's me Satish. - Is this your set up? When I was in college, I was in love with a girl.. Why did you fall in love! And you slapped me and advised. I gave up love. Today I am the owner of this hotel. And also I have 5 branches. - Wow! It's your blessing, sir. Please bless me. Open 5 more hotels. - Stay happy. Sir, you do not need to pay the bill. Who gave you the bill? Sir, no need to pay the bill. If you need parcels of food, I'll send it to you. All I need is your blessings. Have a good day, sir. After all, GST...! Bill! If your lion, I am the lion king. Anyways, we both will wait in the car parking area. You both have a good time. At this table? What an idea! My darling daddy. It's your day. Happy anniversary again! - Thank you, my dear son. Let's go. - I didn't get my icecream. - I'll buy you, come. My boy is a monkey. - Ha? - But a lovable monkey. Aruna.. It's been twenty five years since we got married. I feel like buying you something today. Tell me, what do you want? I want nothing. Ask for whatever you want. I don't want any gifts. But I want to ask you a question. - Go ahead, ask me. Why were you angry on our wedding day? Why do want to know those things now? I asked if you wanted a gift, instead why do you want to go into flashback? I did ask your dad about it that day.. I mean, the reason for your anger. He said that he didn't get you married to that girl because she was not right. And that's why you were angry. How could he know if Lalitha was right or wrong? I didn't mention Lalitha did I? You didn't mention? Let it be. Apparently bad memories will trouble a person for a short period of time but good memories will trouble a person until he dies. Why did you marry me? Because your dad forced you to? I don't know. I cannot ask him because he's passed on. In the future if you get your son married to a girl against his will he will go through what you are going through. No? He will have to live without a Lalitha all his life. When we leave something for our children to inherit it should be something that will invoke good memories about us. This is the only gift I am asking from you that too in all these twenty five years. Wipe your tears. If your son sees you crying, he'll assume that his dad's given in and bring a girl home tomorrow itself! Shall we move? Things need to go my way. I'm not going to take no for an answer Or else you know what's going to happen! Dad! - I'll call you back. What is it? You said everything was going to turn out fine. But see what happened. He is not someone you can take lightly, Dad. We lost money on one hand and respect on the other. So in total how many cooker blasts took place? Ten. Not 10. There were 11 blasts. Go check properly. Mom.. Sorry, mom. Mother! - Aruna.. Appu, console yourself. None of the cookers that we assembled were strong enough to kill anyone. Someone else is behind this. Sir, I'm her daughter and please don't get me wrong for saying this. Why are you playing around with innocent lives for personal gain? What happened to your mother could have happened to mine. And who then would have taken responsibility for that? I asked you to stop indulging in such things when my grandfather was sent to jail. But you ignored me and see what happened now. See, grandpa! Appu. - Tell me dad. In these many years, I as a father have never done anything that you have asked me to, right? Nothing like that, Father. It's not like you will feel comfortable telling me so anyway. Why do you think a father reprimands a son? So that he corrects his wrong doings and falls right back on track. No. That's when he is young maybe. But if a father does so to his grown up son. It means he is trying to see if he still has any control over his son's life! A father may have 50 crore rupees to pass on to his children but that's not the real asset. The real asset is in fact to have a grown up child who out of respect does not cross question his father's opinion. That's the real asset. Please forgive me if I have hurt you in anyway. Dad, you have nothing to apologize for. It's been 25 years since your mother came into my life. Yesterday, for the first time she asked me for something. She wanted me to be okay with our children's choice of life partners. She will be around to see your wedding, right? I'll make sure she is. - She will be alive, right? Politics is the last resort of scoundrels. I mean, criminals are looking to fall back on politics to further their evil motives. Appanna's close aides have used our party symbol and distributed those faulty cookers. This is the CCTV footage from a house, where one of the blasts took place. Also he has harmed his own mother to gain sympathy votes and this is when I realised that politics is the last resort of scoundrels! Politics need these scoundrels. I leave to the people. India is the only place where Politics tout death as a powerful pawn. Thank you very much. If you want to marry my daughter, withdraw from the fray. My son has to win this election. For that to happen, Appu has to withdraw his candidature. If you try to wriggle out of this situation saying you are incapable of making this happen and it's also not good to mix politics and relationships. I'll tell you a story. Very soon you will have a man claiming that your company is built on agricultural land. Once this happens your name will be all over the media. Jagannath Sharma. Jaganath Sharma. Jaganath Sharma Obviously you will then turn to me for help. At that point I'll call a press meet and accuse you of trying to bribe me. So now if you go to court, it will become a civil case and if you come to me, it will become a criminal case! So, Sharma sir think carefully. Or else just find your daughter a suitable groom and get her married. Let her be happy. But, sir.. You know who I am, but what I am capable of Mr Sharma, that's something that's beyond your comprehension! You always asked me if you were good enough. You most definitely are. It's just that I could not see your positives as I compared you with somebody else always. An ex-minister is feeling threatened by your candidature. That itself should tell you how great you are! But those people can stoop down to any level to win this battle. Withdraw from the race. Appanna's withdrawal has more or less ensured Shashank Radhakrishna's win in this election. This development has brought in a celebratory mood among Shashank's party workers. We bring you live footage from his home... Hello! Hello! Ya, ya it's us only. You think I have had a change of heart and am here to congratulate you? Not at all. - First of all.. - First let's garland him. Okay, okay! Now tell. First we came, next news will come! BREAKING NEWS! A stay has been brought on the announcment of Malleshwaram by-election. Electoral fraud is being suspected and the candidature of frontrunner Shashank Radhakrishnan is likely to be disqualified. Judgement from Supreme court. I'm sure you want to know how I pulled this off? But I'm not the one who is behind all this, he is. Wait I'll call him. How was it? Grandpa, you? - Yes, yes. Dad? Yes! I'm sure you want to know how we got him on our side. Let's cut to the flashback. Sir, you look very familiar. LIC agent Shyam Rao? - Shyam Rao, who? The one who visited our old age home. Anyway, he is minister Radhakrishna's father. He is Shashank's grandfather. - Grandpa.. LIC agent Shyam Rao is here, come I'll introduce you to him - No thanks. But he is... - You told us that he is an LIC agent, we remember. You go and chat over coffee or tea with him, please go. I'm so sorry, how would I know, just let this go. Sir, I had spoken to you about that election issue. Oh! That's you is it? - Yes, sir. In 2011 Bihar elections, an MLA candidate got LIC policies done for his constituency voters instead of buying them with cash. However, he got caught as he had made the financial transactions through his own personal account. I'll get insurance cover for all the 20,000 voters in your constituency. Wow! But it's for you guys to figure out a way to get the money transferred from his account! Our reponsibility? Bad news is they are investing in your company. I am overtaking IT company and blacklisting you. This foreign brand tastes really good Let bygones be bygones Shashank. I'm sorry okay! After doing all the damage, you think your sorry is going to make it all okay? I wasn't talking about the elections. I'm sorry for that. Happy? All this is fine, but still.. Don't tell me you are still hung up on the election episode! There is always another election. I'm sure your father is already drafting the next course of action. So don't worry! There is also the possibility of you becoming an MLC. Let's say that also does not happen your followers will make you become the party president at least. And even if all this fails, your father is loaded. He will produce a movie for you and make you a hero! You are still in a good place as you have so many options. But imagine my fate! I became a victim of your revenge story and inturn landed up becoming the troll content for my family for generations to come! Anyways, good luck and all the very best. - Thank you. Looks like everyone's having a sound discussion. Doing good, dude? - All cool. - Father.. - What is it? Dad, the wedding card is almost fine. But can we tweak the name from Appanna weds Abhignya to Appu weds Abhi in a cute way. You fool. The seed can't be changed after a tree grows awkwardly. Let it be the way it is. Ask her if it's right or wrong. Abhi, I have checked it all. It seems fine. You cross check it once. We'll finalize it. You checked it, right? Why are you asking me about it? I feel something is on fire. Isn't it? I can smell the smoke too. Can never understand girls no. - No chance! They don't tell what the problem is. They don't tell what the solution is. What wrong did I do? Many many happy returns of the day, ma'am. I brought you your favorite pineapple cake with extra cheese. I have made it myself. Thank you so much. You're going to have it from me. Have a good day ma'am. Have a good day.. He's finished. Abhi.. Happy birthday.. Get lost. Pack up. All leave. Scene over. He didn't wish your birthday yet? - Didn't you wish the little girl yet? This is how you do two at a time.. Oye. I am better than you, man. Your mom's last birthday I kept an alarm at 12 am. Made sweets for her and fed it myself and wished her. I used to take my scooter and wish my girlfriend sharp at 12 am by climbing her balcony and give her a rose. You know? Who were you talking to on the phone then at 12 lastnight? You weren't wishing her? Mom! If my boyfriend behaved this way I wouldn't have got married only. Hey! Dad. I think I should re-think about this marriage. You want to rethink because of such a silly thing? What's happening here? My birthday is a silly thing for you? I am leaving. Abhi.. What to do now? Cancel means we need to move on. Even you too? Abhi.. Abhi. I was trying to surprise you. I said it on that day and I am saying it today. I'll come millennium after millennium to destroy his love after love .
