Hey, Jen. Yeah, I'm at the bus stop. Listen, Jen, I'm exhausted. I don't know about today. You're awfully insistent. Wendy and George are the only other people coming today, right? Because, you know, you promised to stop setting me up. Really? Really? OK, alright, I'm coming. I am not being picky. I just... I'll know Mr Right when I see him. Because he'll be tall and he'll have nice hair and a good sense of humour and abs of steel. No, I'm kidding. Alright. I'll see you in half an hour. Bye. What was I just saying? Fairground Attractions, big hit of 89. Perfect. It was actually meant to be an ironic song about people's search for perfection in a partner. But everyone took it on face value, which they never intended. Right, exactly. And? Well, that pretty much sums it up, really. Oh, God. So, Alex, did you know John makes 3-D movies, don't you, John? Tell her. Well, I'm just a post-processer. You deliver mail? No, I post-process films. What I do is I take movies and then what I do through the use of stereoscopic, I grab certain footage, well, not grab, but duplicate certain frames and readjust them to replicate a 3-D image artificially. Really? Yeah. The whole thing is ludicrous. I mean, people can't watch a film anymore without it being in 3-D. Give me a break. Yeah. Well, are we all done here? Should we adjourn to the living room for some coffee? Great idea, yeah. - And maybe we can have the telly on... - No football. - Yep, all right. - I hate football. Me too. But I love rugby. What? That's a little joke. You know, football isn't rugby, rugby isn't soccer. You'll have to excuse my great sense of humour. Humour. Or not. Well, why don't you guys go on in and I'll just clear these dishes up? Let me give you a hand. - No, no, no, no, it's OK. - No, it's the least I can do. - Here, let me help, too. - Oh, OK. Yeah, well, we'll just be in the living room, yeah? Make sure everyone's right for drinks, Ken. Yes. Beer? Oh, lovely. Let me do that. No, I'm fine, you guys just sit in the living room. Where is a tea towel? I'll dry up. Uh, it's here. Hey? Thanks. So I'll just leave you guys to it then? What? So, you know Jen, huh? Yes, well, Ken, actually. I deal a fair bit with Ken in my job. So, I'll go first. Things about me, I like old corny movies, I like old cars. Fords are a particular favourite. My favorite music is, I guess, the stuff from around the late 80s, early 90s, you know, the Stone Roses between, the Pixies, that kind of stuff. Say, the Joshua Tree... And OK, it's got a different front end. But I thought to myself, you know, does that really matter? So in the end, I figured, what the hell? You know, you only live once. Let's go for it. Right. And what was it again? The 66 Ford Falcon utility with the 65 front end. I decided to buy it. Right. Yes. Well, I guess Jen was happy for us to do all of this then, huh? So how would you say things are going here? Well, the food was great, but these guys could seriously do with a dishwasher. I mean, between you and me. Between you and me, Jen is not much of a cook. No. I mean, how would you say things are going between you and I? Look, John, you're nice, but I'm tired. And... Wait, don't tell me just yet. Just leave it a moment. Leave it a moment. I'm just trying to... Look from my point of view, I think things are going really well, don't you? No, you're all over the place and you're not listening to me. Jen was right. You can be a bit of a prickly pear. Look, Lexi. Do you want to go out later this night? Lexi, prickly? No. So how are we going here then? Oh, come on, guys, leave those. I'll get the kids to load the dishwasher in the morning. It was awful. Terrible. Pompous git. I'm going straight in there Monday morning and I'm going to say to his face. "No, Terry, that's not the way we play in this department. And you can write up your own sloppy presentation." So does anyone want a coffee? Ken, gonna offer anybody a coffee? Oh, anybody want coffee? I'll have a latte. Thanks. - Skinny latte? - No, just a latte. Why? Nothing. Nothing. John? Yeah, I'll have a skinny latte as well. Thanks. Gotta watch the abs of steel. So? What? So? Him, why? No, there's nothing. Really. Are you sure? I thought you guys would be absolutely perfect together. You keep saying that. Well, if that's all that's left, I'd rather be alone. Seriously. You know what your problem is? You're too picky but you're impatient too. Too picky or a prickly pear? Oh, crap. He told you that. Ha. If John so bloody wonderful. How come he doesn't have a girlfriend? Same reason you don't have a boyfriend. Bitch. When was the last time you even had sex? Oh, my God, can we not do this? Maybe you're just sexually frustrated and you're taking it out on men. I am not sexually frustrated. Oh, thank Christ. Hang on. I don't believe this. My boss just texted. The presentation has been bumped up. We have to finish it tomorrow. - What? - Sunday? So are you going to tell him to do it himself, aren't you? Oh, let's be real. I'm going to have to do it. Thank you. Good night, everyone. Nice to meet you. Alex, so when are you free again? Did we already do this? Okay, let's see. When am I free? Oh, here we go. How's post-apocalypse sound for you? Good? OK, I'll see you then. Hey, you can't blame a guy for trying. I won't take no for an answer. OK, you win. Come on. Excuse me, everyone. I have an announcement to make. As God is my witness, I will never go out with this man. I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last man on earth. Last man in Perth? Last man, what? No, Earth, last man on Earth. Why would I say Perth? I'm sorry, I'm from Western Australia. I guess I'm just homesick. Hello? Hi. Have you calmed down? Jen, please. I'm sorry, I know I acted like a total moron, but I really can't talk about this right now. You didn't like him? Clearly, I'm not making myself understood tonight. No, I did not like him. It's not me. It's him. Please stop setting me up. Promise. Alex, I'm not gonna promise. Promise. OK, you're busy. You gonna get it all done. Yeah. Well, no. There's so much work to do. I'm going to have to get in first thing in the morning. You know, his family owns the drive-in down the coast. Jen. Good night. Good night. This would still be safe. I wish everyone would just leave me alone. Well. I didn't finish it. Hello, what's going on? Oh, come on, Ken, we're not doing a prank message. - All right. - You called Ken and Jen. Please leave a message. Hey, Jen, it's me, if you guys are there, can you pick up? Hello? Can you pick up if you are there, guys? OK, well. Is there something going on today that I don't know about because the city is dead, there's nobody here? Um... Yeah, it's just weird, so, yeah, give me a call. Or actually, I might come over. Yeah. Jen, are you there? Guys? I'm coming in. Technically, it's not a home invasion, it's house sitting. Hello and welcome to the show. Today, I thought we try a little something I've been working on this week. Remember, as a child, your parents leaving you alone at home on a Friday night. Such wonderful memories. Well, now you can relive these magic moments simply by gathering a few choice ingredients from around the house. Here's one that I prepared earlier. Delicious. Pump! Hello. Right, so it's week five day whatever of the land where everybody pissed off. I'm living on canned food and I've taken up smoking because, why not? I gotta say, though, this doesn't feel like hell, hell would have to be worse than this, just being alone. If there is anyone out there, don't despair, I will find you. Actually, I probably won't find you, but still don't despair. Look to yourself, to your inner strength. To your "key". Chi. "Chai"? I have to google it. Oh no, wait, I can't. They must have done something before the internet. I will look it up in a book. Ha. I think I swallowed my toothpick. You've got to be kidding me. Oh my God, Lexie? - Alex. - Alex. - So. - So. - Alex? - Yes. - Not Lexie. - No. - John. - John, yes. - Wow. - Yes. The Falcon XPT. The front end is the... it doesn't matter. What are you doing? Right now, I mean. I just... Oh no, you know. Check your diary and see how are you going for the apocalypse if you're busy. Still cultivating that sense of humour, I see. Wow, nice place. You did well. Hey. I've always lived here. My parents live upstairs. I got a place at the back. They didn't disappear either. No, they're gone. Just didn't feel right to move up there. No. Where would you hide the bodies? Besides, all my stuff is here. Cuppa? Yeah, thank you. What's this? This is my theory on what happened. After I realized everyone was really gone, I went back through all the old news items. It's the best I could come up with. I hadn't noticed that necklace before. Yeah, I... found it. Surprised anyone could lose it, it's huge. Yeah. How are you doing all this? All this? Lights, refrigerator, gas. The lights run off a solar power grid. Everything else runs on a three-phase, biodiesel generator. Did you see the truck at the front of the cage back end? Mm-hmm. That's full of gas bottles for the Weber on the deck. You've got a Weber. Of course, you know, it's like Crowded House say. Everywhere you go, always take the weather, the weather with you. Have you seen anyone else? No, just you. You're it. What's a hadron? A hadron? Um, OK... A hadron is one of the basic building blocks of the universe, or rather it's made of the basic elements of creation. Do you have any understanding of string theory? Less than any? Well, just imagine there's a theory which postulates that the crashing together of hadrons with enough force behind it could prove the existence of transdimensional universes, amongst other things. Like what? Like have you heard of the God particle? The God particle? Oh, well, that's one of the most interesting usages of it, I think. The God particle is this theorized particle which could hold all the secrets of the universe. You explain things well. Not according to my accountant. Your hair looks much better by the way. Great title. Oh, that's a present from Ken. He swears by it. I bet he does. I got stuck on step five, never take no for the final answer. Uh-huh. Here we are. A chick will always say no as a knee-jerk defence mechanism, because she isn't bright enough to know what else to do. You use this time wisely to keep up a firm but friendly push to see each other again. This is a fail safe method unless the woman is adamant. A clue will be if she stands up and declares that she wouldn't see you again even if you were the last man on Earth. No way. It actually says that? No. No, of course not. But look, you got to stage six, getting the chick home. I just don't get any funny ideas, buddy. What, like evolution or special relativity? Exactly. Possums? I sure hope so. I'm not too worried, I'm carrying protection. And why do you have one of those? The taser? No, why do you have a lady razor? No, this is the real deal. No, this is the real deal. It just must be a different model. Here. I'll show you. I don't understand. You OK? I'm just fine. I think I'm just gonna lie here a moment. Hello boys and girls. We are making a cup of tea, aren't we, Eric? Yes, we are, John. We know a song about that, don't we, Eric? Yes, we do. Would you like to sing that song? Would you? ♪ I'm a little teapot, short and stout ♪ ♪ Here is my handle, here is my spout ♪ ♪ When I get all steamed up, then I shout ♪ Ahhh, boiling water. Ahh! We're burnt. Ahh, it burns! Why, John? Every morning, it's always the same. Cuppa? On the veranda, thanks. It's OK. She didn't see anything. Thank you. Oh, and thanks for a lovely evening. So what are your plans for today? Well, I should probably stick to the routine, you know. Make sure the generators fuelled and oiled, top up the hot water system, check the water tanks, keep working on the EMF duplifying magnetron network. You have a hot water system? Yeah. Which means you can have hot showers. Well, sure. OK, I haven't had a hot shower in weeks. Would you mind? Would I mind what? Oh, what was the other thing, the ELO... The EMF Magnetron Duplicator. Yeah, well, if my theory is correct, I think I can reverse what's happened and get us back to... Right. Actually I can hear the shower calling my name. Well maybe I can show it to you later on. Sounds great. Can't stop. Oh, so good! I sure am glad I had a shower before you brought me up here. Yeah, it's a bit of a climb since the power went out. Oh, I'll be fine. I just need to sit. Or lie down. You'll get your breath back faster if you walk it off. So, cables? - Yeah. - Why do you have cables? Well, I'm binding them together. You're binding them? - Yeah. - Why? Well, I'm building an array and the thicker cables give off better EMR. Yeah, I've heard that. Sorry. What are you doing up here again? OK, well, I'm binding the cables together to give at least four inch diameter, and then I'm stretching them out across the city, over the rooftops, see. Oh my God. That stretches halfway around the city. Once I complete the loop, I can fire it up and hopefully recreate the conditions that got us here. Hmm. So we're up here binding, huh? Yeah, but it's hard work. You don't have to help out if you don't want to. I'm happy to keep plodding along. And there's a bit of a trick to it. It might take an amateur a while to pick it up. Amateur huh? Give me a go. So what gave you the idea to do all this? Well, I was thinking about the 3-D process and thought that surely if I can replicate and duplify an EMF signal with multiple cables, then I should be able to create a stereo model of the Higgs boson concept. And then thought about string theory, which would suggest that that would be far more impact over a greater area. You know, I told you last night, you explain things well. Vaguely? I was wrong. Got any plans for tonight? Nah. Keeping my options open. Thought I might go to the movies. Wanna come? Neh. Alright then. That was 20 years ago. So you like corny movies? I like this one. Big crowd tonight. Yeah, yeah. Twice as many as last time I came out here. Last time? Yeah, well. I confess I've come here a bit. Impress the girls, you know. Uh-huh. And how did you impress the girls? Nepotism. My dad ran the place. Wow. Can you really get me in for free, Johnny? And free cordial, all you can drink. I get the run of the place now. Chilly. Here. Sexy. So you and your dad. Used to hang out here while he was working. Then he got sick and he slowed right down. Oh. Nah, what can you do? He's happy now. Or was. I had him all set up with the biggest video projector I could find, and he's happy just to sit there and watch his favorite films. Here, let me show you my favorite trick. Where are you going? OK, watch the screen. That's brilliant. Come here, I'll show you how to do it! OK. Make a cat. No, no, I wanna make a dog. Alright. Here. Put your hands together. Yep, these two. Yeah. And wrap those two around them. - No, no I can't. - Yeah. Like that. - Is that it? - Yeah. It doesn't look right. It's a dog monster. Oh, there! That's it! - There he is. - Yeah. Now how do I make him bark? These bottom two. Yeah, yeah, like that. Well, you know, where there is dogs, there is cats. That's a bit silly, I know. You're not silly. You're funny. Funny looking maybe. No, you're not. Actually you are kind of funny looking. Well, better than your dog. Morning, sleepyhead. Mmh. Coffee? Where's Eric? I thought he made the coffee. Ah, no, he only makes the tea. Can't trust him with the coffee, never could. - So. - So. About last night. Mmm. I had a great time. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, maybe next time we come out here, we can have a bit more fun. What do you mean? Next time I bring you out here, maybe could do something a bit more fun. More fun? Yeah, I got to say, I reckon it's probably a while since either of us had some fun. It's been a while, has it? Is that what Jen told you? Jen? No. Oh, I meant more fun. Yeah, I know what you meant. No, but see, you're talking about... God, you guys are just great, even in a freaking world wide catastrophe, you just can't wait to stick your little thingy into some poor unsuspecting sap/ No, I didn't mean... little thingy? I bet this whole setup was designed just to impress someone like me. The drive in, the Holden ute. - It's a Ford. - Whatever. You've been waiting your whole life for this. Well, I'm here to inform you that it is nothing that's working on me. Well, it wouldn't, would it? - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh, come on. You want this bloody perfect bloody man, but let me tell you something for nothing, that man only exists in your imagination. Sure as hell isn't standing around here. - You can say that again. - Oh, ha ha ha ha. Yeah, you wanna call a spade a spade? You're no prize yourself, you know. Excuse me? Oh, don't get all, "Excuse me," on me. I can see through your act, you know, I don't have to tiptoe around you if I don't want to. Oh, you've been tippy toeing, have you? Maybe I have. Maybe I have. Well, permission to stop tiptoeing. Well, I don't need your permission to stop tiptoeing, I don't need your permission at all. And if it wasn't for whatever happened, you wouldn't even have me and we wouldn't even have this. So, there you go. Well, I didn't realize how lucky I was to have this. Yeah, well, now, you know when I say this. No, John, let me tell you about this. No, I didn't mean. No, Mr. "I'm the last man on earth, and I'm so clever." This whatever this is, it's over. What does that mean? You are now officially free to see other people. What? Alex. Oh, and by the way, last night, your smooth talking, it could use some work. Here's a tip. Nobody says panties. What are you living in a 70s? Panties? What are you talking about? Well, you went on and on about them in your sleep. They're not panties, they're knickers. Oh, yeah. That's real sexy talk. Hey, baby, let me dribble off your knickers. Dribble off? What books are you reading? Alex? Don't go. I didn't mean anything I said. I don't care. Good bye. See you around the trap. Is this the way you keep all your girlfriends when they wanna leave? This is no amateur rig. Someone really knows their stuff. Just give me a minute to figure out how this works. How this... Cut me down. Well, bugger me dead. What have we here? - Nothing. - You OK? Are you normal? Yeah, we're both, thanks. Yeah, I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you calling yourself normal. - Shut up. - I'm cufflinks. Cufflinks? Yeah it's a nickname you can call me Wendy if it makes you more comfortable. - So your real name? - No. I'm John, this is Alex. Well, hello to you both. How did you find us? I was on my way to check out the traps. When I saw you both. I thought I'd lie low and suss you out a bit first. How long have you been here? Oh, about 10 minutes or so. Trucks over there. I guess you guys didn't hear it because you were so engrossed. Wow! Wow! So what's with the traps then? I noticed a few possums around here and I thought I'd try and catch one. And of course, once I figured what happened with the whole "everybody go bye bye" thing. Do you have fuel? You know what happened. Oh, I know exactly what happened. I mean, I guess it all makes sense with the possums being nocturnal, yeah. OK, why don't you guys come back to my place and I'll tell you exactly what happened and why we're here. You do have a car or something, don't you? Yeah, it's that OJ Holden over there. Hey, isn't that a 1966 Ford XP Falcon utility? Yeah, it is only if it's got a 65 front end and we're sort of not driving that. The engine's cactus. Had to push it into place. Had to push it? Where from? I'd rather not talk about it. Um, our car is actually out behind projector room. Righto, what you guys wanna lift your car? No, thanks. We'll walk. I'll see you there. I don't like this. What the following? Well, you know, while that is creepy and all, something just feels wrong. Call it a sixth sense. I'm just gonna concentrate on my cool walking. Straight arms, squinty eyes. OK, guys, follow me. It's only about 10 minutes to my place from here. That allowing for traffic? I can drive. So you live here? Oh, well, you know it's my workshop. Makes sense to crash where you work. It's be a great place to hide the bodies. You're running 240? Oh, no, 110. I can only find Yank converters. Yeah, tell me about it. So is the solar running the lights? No, the solar heats the water and keeps the fridge running. Sweet. What, you running on your solar? No, I converted a three phase Genny. - Diesel? - Bio. Where the bloody hell did you get that? Oh, fish and chip shops, mostly. KFC, McDonald's, Hungry Jacks. Anywhere with the deep fryer. Hungry? I can probably run it for about four days without refuelling. I mean, are you hungry? So why us? Said you'll tell us your theory. What were you doing at a quarter past three on the morning of the 31st of March? I was sleeping. What about you? Yeah, sleeping. - Oh. - What? You see, I know what it is you were doing. - I was doing it myself. - Hey? At 3:15 a.m. our time on the 31st of March 2010 was the precise moment that the first Hadron collision took place in Switzerland. You see, the goal of this experiment was to find the existence of a particle. - The God particle. - Yeah, right. But instead, I believe there's been a particle shift which has caused a wormhole and transported the three of us here. To another dimension, most likely. A duplicate Earth populated solely by us. You explain things well. Not according to my accountant. You see, my theory is that the brainwave fluctuations that occurred during or directly after sexual activity are somehow connected to the particle shift. Particle shift? Sexual activity? Well, at first I thought it was just, you know, sexual activity in the general sense because, well, that's what I was doing. And then I thought about it and I thought surely there would have been more people doing the deed, yeah? Therefore, we can assume that the shift must have been triggered by the hormone that happens when you orgasm, - Orgasm? - Orgasm. -Orgasm -Orgasms. - Orgasms? - Orgasms? Orgasms. - You've got a little bit of... - What? Oh. Yeah, just... Nah, it's got to be said, I don't normally clock my orgasms, but I do know I had one at 12 minutes past three that morning. How do you know? Like I said, I don't normally clock them, but I do know that Todd took me into the height of pleasure at the exact moment the experiment was going on. I'm still not sure whether it was because of his expert manipulations or the excitement of knowing that I was consigning my orgasm with the most exciting experiment to happen on the planet this century. And where is Todd? Oh, Todd never comes with me. He likes to make sure I'm highly satisfied first. Then I spend about an hour doing the same thing to him. So, I guess you two are doing the deed as well, yeah? Huh? Us? Aren't you two? - Oh. - Oh, God, no. Well you were having sex with someone. - Not so much with... - Not exactly... someone. Oh. Well, least I have enough swags for all of us. Although I would ask that you refrain from... Just makes for needless washing. I'm not a fan of washing. Hey, are you awake? Can you believe it, I'm still cold. And I wanted to say I'm sorry for this morning. It's stupid for us to fight, don't you think? I know you're gonna say you were to blame. Maybe you have a point. John? That is funny. You are so funny. Am I really funny? Well, funny looking maybe. Oh, well, all I can say is thank God that the last man on earth is funny, you're not funny looking. In fact, you're kind of cute. Hey, you don't mind if I dribble these pants off you? Oh, don't worry, I'll keep my panties on. I'm not trying to seduce you or anything. My name is Wendy, I'm so clever, I'm packing the car. OK. It's on. There you are. Didn't know where you'd gone to. So what's happening? Taking a trip, a secret American military base. Secret American military base, can you believe that? And where is this so-called secret American base? Secret American military base. Well, it's a secret, of course. Luckily, my parents had an old map which had a clue on it. Governments with so much more open back in the 1950s, That's not far from here at all. Why would they build a base so close to the city? Bloody urban sprawl. And what exactly are we going to do at this SAM? Well, I've figured out how to reverse this whole mess. Sure could use some help if you guys want to come. Reverse what exactly? Well everything. We'll be able to get back. Back to our lives. We won't be alone anymore. - Well... - Sounds like a great idea. What about your idea? Your plan? What did you have in mind? Oh, nothing really. As a matter of fact, John was gonna set up a web of three inch cables and create gamma rays to transport us back. Oh, that's good. That's really good. Are you serious? Well, it's just something to do. Just something to do. Where are you going to power it? Electrical storm? Or more likely, several electrical storms striking simultaneously. Tell her, John. Yeah, I guess I hadn't really thought that far ahead. You hadn't thought that far ahead? Well, I had to do something. Whoa, guys, it's OK. It's not that big a deal, you know. It's always important to keep your hands busy. Look, um, the morning's getting away from me, so I got to get going. Like I said, you're more than welcome to come. Otherwise, I'll see you later, yeah? Maybe we should go. Help her out. - What do you think? - What do I think? I think you stop thinking every time she's around. - I... hey? - Nothing. Guess we should go. Great. I can only have one in the front though, road rules and all that. Shot gun. Of course. There's a secret American military base here? I had no idea. Yeah, well, it's a secret but they left some markers here so you could easily find it. I changed the password when I found this place. You can't be too careful about protection, can you? What? There it is. The base is down this ladder. Oh, I should point out, though, if you cross this threshold, there's no turning back. Once the wheel's moving, it can't be stopped. So if you're coming down, you're 100 percent committed. OK? OK. So the bigger decision than we were first led to believe, hey, John? What do you think? John? Lights. They're running that bio-watcha-ma-call-it thing here, too. Oh, no, this is hooked up to the emergency grid connected to the Snowy Mountains. Endless power supply. Silly me. OK, well, I'll check launch progress and initiate flight patterns. John, you know how to convert global positioning from the old American standards, don't you? I might need to brush up. Oh, no worries. It's easy, I'll show you. See, look. What you need to do is you take this first digit and then you transpose... I might need to brush up too. Yeah, I guessed that. So what is your plan exactly? Well, like most big thermonuclear weapons, to start a fusion reaction, you need a fusion primer. This is called the primary stage trigger. Now, this creates so many crazy hot particles that it triggers a second fusion reaction or the big boom. Now it is theorized that a fusion reaction with sufficient mass could create a singularity. Right? Maybe I should have said, "What's your plan in general?" Well, a singularity, the point at which matter becomes infinitely dense, should create a wormhole. How do you know all this stuff? I have a PhD in physics. I majored in Einstein-Rosen Bridge. Wormhole Theory. So you're suggesting we set off a whole bunch of thermonuclear weapons to create a wormhole? Oh, wait a minute. There are nuclear weapons here? Oh, there are a couple in Australia. Pine Gap, Maralinga, Dubbo. But we can control every launch pad in the world from here. Because all I've been doing for the last five weeks is cracking passwords to major installations, sorting various yields and detonators, initiating prelaunch sequences and working at various trajectories. This is what you've been doing for the last five weeks? Mostly, yeah. Well, I could have played dress ups and driven around ranting on my CV but how pathetic would that be? So where are we in this scenario? Oh, close enough to the source of the explosion to be assured of being sucked into the wormhole, which I figure is about here if we detonate for an airburst of about a thousand metres. Sorry, we're actually gonna be standing at ground zero? Well, yeah. And what happens then? What happens then? The reverse of what happened the first time course. Right. Of course. So we will all go back to where we came from back to the night when this all happened. Exactly. And you're positive this will work? That's the beauty of it. If it works, then we go home. And if it doesn't, instantly vaporized. Can I speak to you in private? OK. Would you excuse us a moment, please? Sure. I don't know about you, but I've eaten trail mix less nutty and fruity than that. - What do you mean? - What do I mean? Well, if we believe for two seconds that this so-called military base can do what she says it can, unless I'm mistaken, she's talking about standing directly under a nuclear explosion in the hope - the hope - that it might just create a wormhole. I don't know. The theory is sound. Don't worry, I get it, John. Get what? Well, now that you've consummated your love with Little Miss Angsty Pants. Consummated? Angsty pants? I'm sorry, should I have said angsty panties? You're talking gibberish. She could be a genius. A beautiful genius, yes. Beautiful? Listen, shut up. Some risks they're worth taking but this? We could die. You're right, I mean, it's a bit different now, but it's totally liveable. I thought you'd say that. Let's go break it to her. We are not going with you. Oh, really? Oh, I don't know, Alex, I guess I must have suspected you were gonna say that. This woman does not speak for me. Then get over here. You're gonna shoot me now, you can't wait another hour or so? Johnny, can you grab that gaffer tape, please? Johnny? Bleuch. Bind her good. OK, now all we need is some train tracks. You know what, Alexsi? I have been wanting to do this since the first moment I saw you. Well, the bombs are well and truly on their way. Should be here in T minus one hour and 36 minutes. They will all come, Johnny, and we'll set things right. Is that grunting bothering you? No. I've trained myself to ignore minor irritations. 'Cause it's doing my head in. No worries. Uh, what's that? It's a sap. You use it to knock people out. Or I can just take her into the other room? Either way, but take this in case she gets feisty. Why do you have one of these? It's a sex thing. Traitor. I'll be happy just to see you flash fry. - Shh! - Do you really think your girlfriend's gonna take you through her enchanted physics hole and back to the land of the happy leprechauns? Wendy's great. She's gonna get us back home. She's a lunatic, a fruitcake, a picnic blanket short of a picnic blanket out of a... Please don't tape my mouth again. If only you knew how great Wendy is. OK, that's not true. I agree with you. She's nuts. I see it in her but you don't wanna see it. Again, not true. I'm crazy about you, Alex. I've been crazy about you since the moment I met you at Jen and Ken's. So I'm going back to the other side with Wendy. And we are going to breed beautiful children, even though we have not consummated our relationship yet. Nothing happened with Wendy last night, I swear it. You swear it? Yeah, well, of course. I knew it. I can't wait to meet you in the real world, Johnny. You will not regret this. - I'm taking us home. - Home? What are you doing? A razor? What? Oh, you kinky... Listen, I can shave later, you dirty old man. Right now, I don't have time. Stupid, lousy taser razor. - Oh, and I just had another thought. - What's that, babe? After I've finished the reconfiguration, there's something else we need to be doing. Oh, yeah? Orgasming at the time of critical mass. Oh. It's the only way to make sure that the wormhole reopens and we remember everything. Some of us will be going home soon. Gentle. I am home. You are home? I don't understand. - What do you mean? - Before. She said... Before she said we're going home. It doesn't matter. Come on. We've got to stop these bombs from going off. Well, come on. Oh. I'm a goose. Yes, would you hurry up? - What are you doing? - I don't know. Maybe I can divert the missiles. If we can just figure out the guidance system. The one that took Wendy five weeks to figure out? Yeah. You're gonna figure that out in less than an hour? Well, how hard could it be? Maybe if I just press this button. Missile profiles accelerated. Detonation now in two... Accelerated. How the hell do you accelerate a missile? Two minutes? It's too late! - But that means... - I know. Unless... wait. - Climax. - Yeah. Yeah. You could say this is a bit of a climax. No. We both have to orgasm when the bombs hit. Both of us at the same time? Well, this is how we got here in the first place. Like Wendy was saying, the things, or... whatever that we released when we... It'll stop us forgetting. We'll remember everything. OK, I suppose that makes sense. I don't wanna forget this, John, so we have to have these orgasms. - Come on. - We haven't even kissed. I mean, you know, can't we at least work up to this? - You said you loved me. - I think what I said was... - We have less than a minute. - Less than a minute. OK. I'm not saying I'm not capable of performing here, but, you know, I just thought, oh, my God. Oh, the concrete is cold. - Come on. - You're not helping here. I mean, you're meant to be saying something sexy. Sexy? How about um, hot stuff. Hot stuff? You see that makes panty sound like gold. I think I'm gonna... - No, hang on. - What? Hang on? Is this good? Oh, yes. No, no, shit. Oh, yes. Oh, there it is. OK. Oh, God, don't stop. Don't stop what? What am I doing? Oh, shut up, I think. Oh, yes. Oh, God, yes. Yeah, baby, the earth just moved. No, no, I don't think so. I think the earth is exactly where we left it. Oh, you came all right. Big time. Afraid not, Todd ball. Barely registered. Pity. I was trying to come with a Hadron collision. The what? You're a weird chick, you know that? Hello? Alex, can you hear me? Where the hell are you? Where am I? That's a very good question. Where the hell are you? I beg your pardon? It's 9:15, Alex, why aren't you here? I am here. I am here. Oh, my God, you little pearler. What? Get down here right away, Alex. That presentation needs to be finished right now. No, no, I'll be in later. What? Actually, I've got a lot of stuff I need to do today. A whole lot of stuff. Consider this a resignation. Resignation? Oh, for crying out... John. Hello, I need the number for a John um... Actually, scrap that. I need the number for a guy in Taringa who posts films. No, he turns classic films into 3D films. 2B Or Not 3D. That'll be it. Yep, OK, thanks. Yes, I'll hold. Hello. Thank you for calling 2B Or Not 3D. Please leave a message after the beep. John? Hey, we're back. It's me. I'm coming over, so don't try and find me. Stay where you are. Oh. It's you. You remember? How could I forget? Despite what you may think it's not every day I'm personally humiliated like that. Sorry? Is that an apology for yesterday? Yesterday? Oh, you don't remember anything else? Like what? Any other insults? To be honest, I'm trying not to let that one sink in. OK, you don't remember the rooftop? The drive-in? The crazy Wendy chick? I remember a crazy chick. - You do? - No, no, you're the crazy chick. Oh. Um... OK. So, I've had a lot of time to think since yesterday and you're not as bad as I thought. Right. Um, OK. What I'm trying to say is I'd be willing to give you another chance. Wait. Look, Alex, I'm not the last man on earth, you don't have to worry. Now, if you don't mind, I've got a classic film in here that I'm trying to convert to 3D. You think you know someone, huh? I mean, we saved the world together. I can't believe he wouldn't give me another shot. - Why wouldn't he? - Here, drink this? Hopefully, you'll make it back to this planet. So, the guy doesn't like me. He fell in love with me. He told me, well, indirectly, no, very directly, that he'd fallen in love with me the moment he set eyes on me. They all say that, hon. They're just bastards. If he loves me so much, how come he can't get over my behaviour yesterday? The other day. Whenever the hell it was. Oh, good morning. What's going on? Well, Alex got caught in a black hole. Wormhole. Sorry, wormhole and just spent the last five weeks in an alternate universe where John was the last man on earth and they both fell deeply in love. But now John can't remember any of it and doesn't want a bar of her. He's probably at that stupid drive-in right now. Huh, I bet he is. All on his lonesome, "'Cause someone's gotta run the cinema." Alex, maybe what you need to do right now is rest. Why don't you lie down in the spare room? Hmm? OK, thanks for the tea. You. I want to apologise. Apologise? For the other... For yesterday. Oh? I did not give you a chance and now that I've had time to get to know you... to think about what you were trying to tell me, I think... I firmly believe that we could maybe... I don't know. Would you be interested in seeing me again? Is this some kind of joke? Are you working for Prank Patrol or something? No. It's legit. Please forgive my scepticism, but you did say to me you wouldn't go out with me if I was the last man on earth. Yeah, I was wrong about that. I would. Well, that's an ego boost. Thanks. You'll excuse my blushing. Wow. This is all going so wrong. I'm sorry. Alex. You were right about me. I just read this stupid, stupid book. 'Ten Steps to Getting the Girl You Want, Even If She Doesn't Want You'. Oh, God. You've read the book. A little. Is there a chance we can start afresh? No games this time. I'd really like that. Do you like corny movies? I love corny movies. I like your necklace. Fuck. Sorry. Hang on, wait. Yeah, the whole thing is ludicrous. What people can't watch a 3D film anymore without it being in 3D? From my point of view, I think things are going great. Sorry. Laughing in anticipation. That's how funny I am. Sorry, sorry, fuck sorry. Still rolling. - All she has to do is sleep. - Oh, God. Really? Then why did the lead singer form a band called the Patron Saints of Imperfection, hey? It's 'cause she wanted to disabuse people of the idea that. I don't know. I fucked that up completely. Sorry. Still rolling. Don't. Hello. We're making a... Fuck. I'm so sorry. Cut, cut, cut. Oh, well, I should probably stick to the routine. What do you mean? I should probably stick to the routine. What do you mean? Well, make sure the generators fuelled and oiled, top up the hot water tanks, chip... Oh, for fuck's sake. That's my phone. You got any plans for tonight? Nah. I'm keeping my options open. 'Cause I thought I might take you to a strip club.
