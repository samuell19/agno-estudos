What did you say his name was? Ma'am? His name? Rocky. Rocky who? Mental. I wasn't born yesterday. You don't have to tell me what to do. They forbade us. Why are you hiding? Show yourself. Let's do this face to face. Watch out, here I come. Don't delay it any further, sir. Declare me the winner as per the rules. Sir, media is here. Throw in the towel and forfeit the match. I too have a responsibility. Disqualify Rocky. Declare him the winner. Don't disqualify him, sir. Rocky will be here soon. I've just spoken to him. Don't disqualify him, sir. It's the state's finals. So Patiala, cat caught your tongue? Don't see your high flying boxer anywhere? Why the sad face chimp? Why? Nothing to say today? Having a banana, huh? Don't you wish to have my slap? I'll have you peeled from head to toe. You monkey, I won't spare any spot. Don't waste your time here. Go and guard your boss. Who's too eager to win the match. The fight will take place soon. Make sure he doesn't faint before off anxiety. Today Rocky will teach you loudmouths a good lesson. He won't be able to do anything. You won't even see his shadow today. Here, I am standing before you. Let's see what he does. Brother, I had asked Satbir to do the job. He had said he'd get rid of him. It's not so easy. Now it is going to have an insulting end. 'Village Fatehgarh Chhanna's resident Rocky wins Punjab Boxing State final.' 'Now all eyes on the state boxing champion Rajdeep Singh.' 'Rajdeep Singh (Rocky), a rising star of Punjab boxing.' 'Punjab's star Rajdeep Singh enters National quarterfinals.' 'Rajdeep Singh defeats last time's winner with a knockout in the semifinal.' Mr. Shergill, as the sports minister, what would you like to say about Rocky's achievements? At the moment, boxing is at its peak in this country. At this level, there is no competition for us. Out of the boxers chosen for the commonwealth games.. ..no one can match up to this boy's talent. Media and opposition only talk about Punjab's drug addicts. Now this boy will tell them what can a youth from Punjab do. We are standing inside Rocky's house. At his mother's maternal village, Fatehgarh Chhanna. We all know about the fame Rocky has earned in the boxing world. Come, let's show the life and childhood of this star outside the limelight. Kids are born mischievous. I am Rajdeep's uncle. What can I say about his childhood? He has been a wild child since the very beginning. Old ladies used to complain about him to his mother. He used to sometimes break someone's head. Sometimes he would dislocate bones. What can I say? Our boy used to be responsible for all the injuries caused to other kids in the village. It's God's grace that he has been blessed with such fame. There is a good possibility of injuries when it comes to boxing. Aren't you scared for your son? Why should I feel scared, dear? He plays under the shade provided by Lord. He watches everything. He used to love to fight. Till the time he stayed in the village.. ..the boys in the village feared for their well being. He caused so much damage. Cracked a few skulls. Where's Kala? Where's Kala? Kala! Come here, oh brave one. Permanently brain damaged at the hands of Rocky. Come here, oh brave one. Hurry up. Look, they are taking an interview for television. Greet them. Fold your hands and welcome them. He is shy. It's okay. Don't worry. They just want to talk to you about Rocky. About brother? - Yes. Hello. Villagers have never seen a rivalry like ours. Brother Rocky and I have fought a number of times. Brother Rocky used to lift me up like this. Like Lord Krishna had lifted the mountain on his little finger. Just like that. You don't believe it? She doesn't believe it. My teeth... May my brother live and nice and a happy life. Love you, brother Rocky. Love you, brother Rocky! Where are you from? - Shut... 'A clash between Bikram Sherpurwala gang and ANSI.' 'A clash between Bikram Sherpurwala gang and ANSI.' 'Boxer 'Rocky' a part of university shootout.' I have only two years left until retirement, Mr. Sekhon. I thought they would pass without any trouble. But I got the orders from the top. And I have to follow the orders that I get. It's a job. I cannot question them. Mr. Sekhon, I was going to call you in a day or two. Good that you came on your own. Whatever that happened in the past few days was unfortunate. For you as well as for the federation. Federation was affected in a bad way. The whole world knows about your contribution to this field, to boxing. But the stigma on your name because of this... There are salary arrears that federation owes me. I had come to give an application for that. Tainted in a doping racket, Waryam Singh Sekhon resigns. Indian boxing coach Waryam Singh Sekhon caught in a doping scandal. Just a few moments before the final Commonwealth team selection Waryam Singh accused of doping allegations Players miss you, sir. The Game needs you. I have dedicated my life to this game. Rocky is paying for what he did, sir. You aren't responsible for his circumstances. This is the Indian National camp, not your village wrestling pit. Players here play for their country and their careers. You don't deserve to be in this camp. Go away. Go be a tough guy somewhere else. Get lost from here. Out! Preet! Earthquake! Earthquake! The roof is falling! I am dead! I am so dead! Earthquake! Where are you going? Wait! - Let me go, Rocky! Let me jump, the roof is falling. Let the roof fall, I won't let any harm come to you. Rocky, it's not so easy to come out of the rubbles. Behave yourself. What is this nonsense? Preet! Sweetheart! I was just joking. You dog. You almost killed me. You have crossed your limits of friendship, Rocky. You were the one crossing the limits. Rocky, let me go. Let me jump. My mansions and pillars are falling. Don't make me curse at this holy hour. No brother, don't curse me. "Don't come closer, I don't like you." I don't wish to dwell in your eyes, woman. Stop the drama and get up. Let's go running. I won't move a limb even if you are dying. Lord Almighty. Baby... hey baby... Go away, you leech. Don't you have to attend the camp? Baby, I am out of the camp. Coach threw you out? What happened? a shootout at the university happened ... don't remember ... Rocky bro, it's just going to be us and them ... no one else ... didn't turn out like that did it? Half the university turned witness on me. but Devinder bro was certain there would be no one what the hell's wrong with you? you're getting way too close to Devinder ... Don't blame me. I don't tag you along. As if you fight only for me , right? Oh Lord! What dark times! What dark times! You fight for them and then they unjustly accuse you. Strike these sinners down almighty Scoundrel. - Get up! Freshen up and change. I've had enough, Rocky. Go back to your hostel. Don't want to see the sight of you. Oh my, this is what makes me crazy about you, sweetheart. Let me see how you don't go for running. Come on baby, get up. What are you doing, Rocky? Let me go. Rocky! Get me down. - Let's go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Did you see that? Hey! They wind is fast, don't get yourself hurt. He isn't scared. He is fearless. I have seen many boxers. But they are the first ones I have seen who punch in the air. Ibadat, in local terms this is called swanking. I have seen dogs barking, chasing after cars, never seen them barking from inside one. What the hell! You okay, bro? Put your hand down let me see. - I'm fine. I'm seriously done with these house parites man, Ibs, let's go to Delhi. I seriously need to update my late winter wardrobe So... Seriously? You have a penchant for trouble. Stop talking and learn to use your hands. If you end being confronted, a good hook will help you. Really? Any other advice? Keep him on leash. He's crazy. Hey! How dare you touch her? Ibadat, in local terms this is called swanking. You hit him as well because of me, right? You want to go first? Tell me if you need anything else. We done? You've left an impression. Can we go now? Let's have another swig. I'm done. Let's go. Brother, there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu. What's his room number? I don't know. Damn you. He is here since 6 years. Still no one knows him. Brother, there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu. Damn you. He is here since 6 years. Still no one knows him. Brother, there is a boy from Rotak, Bholu.

Shall I call you Lankesh, instead? Hello, brother. Rajdeep Singh Taliwal. I heard you've take over our group? These recruits are getting too ambitious . They want success overnight. That's convenient. I keep fighting the enemies and you grab all the headlines. You cannot grab the headlines by doing next to nothing. Here's the solution. First of all, sell off the hyenas you surround yourself with. And get yourself treated. Your bones are stiff. And if you get a good deal on courage in the market take it. I'll pay for it. From my personal account. Don't act too smart, my boy. Airbags like you love firing shots. Beating kids in the under 19 age group on steroids You're wrinkling up, my boy Why don't you forget the sport and fire shots while you can You might never get the good times back This time the chances of you being selected are difficult. You think you're cool, darling. This friendship goes back 8 years. You can kid around. You're forgiven. Tell me dear, how are you doing? I am doing well, brother. Swing by in the evening. We'll shoot the shit. He doesn't have time for wastrels like you. No problem brother, I'll come in the evening for sure. Why do you waste your time on these morons? Rocky stay in your limits. We guys go way back I have some reputation over here. Let him get beaten up. He needs his dose. Bholu... Hey Bholu... Why don't look away? Hear me out. Damn you, you just got slapped twice. It's not a big deal. You get beaten up in the ring every day. They were my cousins. It was someone else, I would've torn them apart. Oh damn. Dhaiye, a little My brother, have at least a little shame. You just got slapped. What were your cousins saying? Just the usual. My uncle's eldest son is getting married. They asked me to come along. - I said, get... Now should I leave my training to go dance at a wedding? Lazybones! You are a no good boxer. You eat the fruits bought by the government. Your hands are only good to play cards. What training are you going to miss? Make yourself useful sometimes. Rimpy. - Yes? Get dressed. We have a wedding to attend. Come on, get up. Let's go. Hey!

Goddess is calling. Preet! Preet! My blood pressure is dipping. It's plunging. Catch it. Rimpy! Get the car You need to hook me up with glucose. Take a banana. Banana! Be a brother and slice it up for me. The spice kit is in my bag. Answer your phone, Rocky. Who is calling that scoundrel so early in the morning? Hello, who is it? WARYAM SINGH - DHAIYE Hello, sir. Where's Rocky? He's here, sir. He has gone out. Waryam Singh tell him if he's lost the desire to play for India, he should vacate the room ... the government's not spending it's money on his pleasure's Okay, sir. Where's Rocky? Sir, the wall had glass pieces stuck on the top. Go to the clinic and get it stitched up. Okay, sir. Your sister-in-law worries for you. You should go meet her. Get ready and come downstairs. Youth party members are waiting for you. White garbs suits you, brother. Your sharp moustaches are good too. When you babble in a fair before a crowd.. ..you must be getting the wrong impression of being in power. I do politics. I don't sulk in the room. He broke your face and my heart. But we aren't going to lose our mind over it. Let him soar high. You don't hunt in broad daylight. When the time is right... When the time is right... I'll make him fall. Get ready and come downstairs. Youth party members are waiting for you. Seerat, everyone is staring at you. Look at their eyes and tell me what they say. Wait. You are so scared. I express my feelings and you think it's funny. I don't. I like what you say. Didn't your friends teach you how to talk to girls? You should be glad they haven't. Okay then let me teach you. But you'll have to pay me fees, okay? Assume if a very sweet and lovely girl.. ..asks you your opinion on her looks. Then you should lightly blink and say: "Seerat, I cannot look away from your face." "How can any words be enough to define you?" What rubbish. Read the reply in my eyes. How good is that! Now I believe for sure that an idiot like you.. ..didn't have any girl as a friend before. And he sulks again. You get upset at the drop of a hat. Don't you think you have too much attitude? It only matches my beauty. Come on preet. From orchard to orchard we go searching thee our dearest rests in a vineyard on a tender knee Keep quiet. Don't get heartbroken because of this wrong belief. What you call an idiot is loved by sportswomen. It's me who doesn't care for them. Look at that peacock. What a sample! Let's go. We are getting late. Are you done with your tea? Wait, let me enjoy his dance. Preet! Preet! Let him go! You buffoon, let him go! Let him go! Someone help him! They will kill this poor chap! No one will come to save him! And they say Punjab is full of brave people! She's a firecracker! - Let him go! I'll have to call the police. Get lost! Hello, is this the police station? I am calling from the University. Wait, girl. My previous case is still pending! - Give me my phone back! My previous case is still pending! - Give me my phone back! Give it back! Stop staring and at least call the cops! Don't you have any humanity left in you? Drink your tea and coffee, guys. Sister is just blabbering. I'll let you go but don't scream. I'll let you go but don't scream. Preet is my brother, you idiot. Thank you! He hit me, the rascal! - Dhaiya plead her to stop! - Hit a poor helpless girl! Sister! Sister! Please don't. Don't scream, police will come. - You want to dance like a peacock now? Don't scream, police will come. There is a drought in the village. My family is ruined. There are no fruits left to eat. My brothers and nephews are starving. All the fields are destroyed. All the animals are dead. I am not lying. I am just about to cry. You don't care about the place or time, before acting yourself. Listen to me. - I'll teach you a lesson. Preet, please listen to me. You never behave yourself. - Please listen to me. At least hear me out. - You scoundrel... Preet! Listen to me. You can vent your anger later. First hear me out. You got a job at the railways, buddy. You got a job at the railways, Preet! I just met the director. You've done it! May I have one more cappuccino on my table please? Yes Maam I want... Do you sell beer as well? No sir, just tea and coffee Tea and coffee is just isn't enough. Beer drinkers seem to be reining these days. Can I have one more cake that says sorry sent at that table? Watch out Preet, here I come. Isn't the peacock going to peck at the cake? He likes fruits. He goes to market on Friday to buy bananas and all. Isn't she the same girl? She's all dolled up today. Did you inform your family? No, I didn't. You are heartless. Good news has come after a long time. Your sister must have been praying for her brother's job. Go then I'll go and talk to them. Yes, you go. We will wait for you. You are the one who has to cut the cake. Who is that girl? Who? The one who is "all dolled up." A friend. Our friend. - Our? Yes. Preet's. What kind of a friend? What do you mean what kind? Like us. Tea and coffee friend. But she is urban. Let me tell you... These modern ones like villagers. Preet is the reason she became like that. She was quite dull before. Not good looking at all. Stop it. You are lying. Well if you don't want to believe me then... Sir maam has sent this for you Why is she saying sorry? Rocky! Why aren't you telling me? Tell me already! I am sorry I didn't believe you. Rocky... Rocky, tell me, I am getting upset. Listen to this, girl. Preet is naïve. He has no bad habits. I am telling you because you are asking me. This girl and Preet... they were together for 2-4 months. They were getting along well. Then Preet fell for someone else. Preet is honest. Preet put his cards on the table. His cards were good. Now you tell me... Can a two of clubs match up with beauty.. god bless me With queen of shades? She lost it. Look at this, the tactics of a broken heart. Can you win over love with cakes and patties? Take it take it. Set the witch right! Get this straight. And remember it. Your tactics won't work. If you do such a thing again. I'll use my sandals. Don't assume me to be a rustic villager. Rocky, you are a dog. Why, brother? I am not my father's son if I don't make you cry. Preet! - Hey! Come here! Come on, buddy! Preet! Hey! - He gets upset so easily. That was my final's assignment. What did you tell that lunatic? Don't get hyper. What's your problem? What nonsense was she talking about? What did you tell her about me? Get this straight. I don't know you. I met her today. Handle your own matters on your own. You think you are a star? You must be in your sports hostel. But I make the city dance to my tunes. Comparing notes, are we? I am yet to seek revenge from you. Use your attitude towards those city chaps. Those softies might endure it. I'll crush your arrogance brutally. What my attitude, alright, you're up then . Tiggi! Tiggi! Come here, dear. Outsiders aren't allowed in here. I know. You need special permission to play here. Do you have the permission? Yeah. Who gave you the permission? Rocky. Rocky also said that I could play here whenever I want. No one will trouble me. No, sir. I swear. "My love, I don't look good, without you." "I am worthless, without you." "My love, I don't look good, without you." "I am worthless, without you." "God give an opportunity to dream about you." "Thank you for coming into my life." "Thank you for coming into my life." "You reside in my heart, instead of the heartbeat." "I can live without breathing, but I cannot survive without you." "You reside in my heart, instead of the heartbeat." "I can live without breathing, but I cannot survive without you." "I never even thought about living without you." "Thank you for coming into my life." "Thank you for coming into my life." "Love flows in my veins, my love." "In my veins, my love." "People worship God. You are my God, my love." "You are my God, my love." "Love flows in my veins, my love." "People worship God. You are my God, my love." "I thank you for making me yours." "Thank you for coming into my life." "Thank you for coming into my life." How's it going? Hey! Going to your class on foot? Don't like cars anymore? Started liking walking more. It's a beautiful afternoon so I thought I might as well... A beautiful afternoon is better enjoyed in a car. Get in. No, I am happy being on foot. What happened? Rocky didn't even leave the scope of us having a conversation? Shut up, loser. I met your parents last night. At Aman's wedding. Yeah, mom told me. We spoke for quite some time. They were inquiring about you. Don't worry, I didn't tell them anything about Rocky. What could I tell them? He isn't even worthy of mention. Surviving on hostel's leftovers. Worthless goon. Maninder, stop the car. Let me out. I said let me out. I have hidden your misdirected desires. But get this straight. Storms only blind you with dirt. They don't caress foreheads. Come on! Up . Come on. - Rocky! Rocky! Do you want to hurt him for real? Come here! - Move! Baljeet, are you hurt? I've tried every trick in the book with you. I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. But you just aren't concerned. Selectors are being pressured into not selecting you for Commonwealth. If they see you behaving wild and out of control like this.. .they'll throw you out immediately I have always ignored your crazy antics. But you don't seem to want to mend your ways. If the limitations of the sport suffocate you, you can leave. You have a reputation as a hooligan. Your employer will quote a good price for you. Coach, I need your advice. From the time I got busy with the camp.. ..Preet has gotte closer to Devinder. He seems to be getting influenced by him. He isn't listening to me. And you know how Devinder is. It's new for him. He has just moved out of your shadow. Wants to be his own man. I know Preet well. He is a sweet kid. He's a foolish kid. He doesn't know what's good or bad for him. He isn't hotheaded like you. He will listen to me. Ask him to meet me. It's a good thought to console the heart, Ghalib. Commonwealth team's final selection takes place next week. Rajdeep... The glory you seek hides in your shadow somewhere.. Don't get consumed by the fire of your demons Let the fire be your guiding light, Rajdeep. What are you thinking about? Can you answer. Nothing. Why do you hide everything from me? Why do you have to dig deep into everything? I am a psychology student. It's in my nature. Can I ask something? Don't if you can help it. University students have a nickname for you. I don't like it. You can call me Rajdeep. No, it's soemthing else. Mental? Why do they call you that? Who are they? Devotees. There's work. You need to come with. Learn to fight your own battles. I'm not kidding around. It's serious. What are you driving around this mob for? Ruin their lives as well. Stop it, Rocky. Bikram and 30-35 of his goons are waiting for us. I had warned you to stay away from Preet ! Rocky! He doesn't play on my command. Our friendship goes back 8 years. He is true to it. You've survived on my alms these 8 years. It all ends today. Time you find a new master. The curse of the feminine touch softens one up. Has she made you vow not to. Let me handle this, brother. Look Rocky, be a brother and come along today. Only today. We will teach him a lesson today. We will never ask you to do it again. Not today, not anymore, Preet. Enmity isn't a lover you can play with and then let go, Rocky. You marry your enmity and stay faithful to it for eternity. If abandoned, enmity will vengefully eliminate you and carry on. Let's go, Preet. Preet's not going. Rocky, let go of my hand. It's clear how much you care about me. Rajdeep Singh Dhaliwal. Envious of your friends courage? You always kept him under your shoes. Let him sprout up for once. You pit one of yours against two of Vikram's. You might just triumph. If you want to combat me then let's go. Rocky, let go of my hand. Let go of my hand. Stop trying to be my parent! Rocky, behave. Let Preet go. Let him go. If you're going to make me beg I can grab your feet. Stop blowing the trumpet on our friendship. I'm not dancing to your tunes anymore. Rocky, Preet isn't a kid. You should behave with him properly. And I am not your boyfriend. Don't make any claims on me. He loves you. He is crazy. But he can die for you. And I won't? But today he insulted me. How are you doing, boxer? You have tears in your eyes. All good? He sometimes throws punches in the wind. Sometimes wipes tears with his fists. What kind of boxer is he? You don't take a punch to your face! You blabbermouth! Oh my! The firecracker just pierced my heart. Hey, why are you troubling him? It's a shame. His brother doesn't even sigh. Mind you, she the tail's wandered into the fair without the dog. He's a national boxing star. He considers him nothing. Do you have any money in your pocket to spend at the fair? Shut up, will you? He is a senior officer in the railways. Look at his pride. What, you got the fleas? I need to teach someone a lesson. Maninder Shergill. Learn to fight your own battles. I have nothing to do with Rocky anymore. You have always been his lapdog. You can ask him one more time. I have also always stood by you. Oh really? Today you were clinging to his pinky? Don't make me beg. Stand by me today. And I'll owe you my life. Our friendship goes back 8 years. So should I carry you around in my arms? If you have the courage then take the gun from my room and shoot him down. Don't weep like a girl. Falcons don't flutter around screeching Falcons catch their prey by their skulls Don't end up just growling like your friend. You've got to have a bite too. You've rebelled from my orders? I haven't. Preet has. He left the company of dogs and joined a pack of wolves. I would have invited you too but you are too damn cold. And the fire inside you has been extinguished with love. Winter's upon us, Romeo, and you're all abandoned and cold.. . but we will offer you alms We will give you a much needed dose of manhood You get into action when you get targeted, huh? Preet, what is this childishness? You are my life. Your obstinacy is manliness. And my obstinacy is childishness? My future belongs to you? My past belongs to you? Decisions, friendships, you have a right over everything? At least let my life be my own. don't take away my right to live it or end it Preet... Preet... Preet... Preet... Preet! Please open the door. Preet Listen to me. Atleast hear me out. Waryam Singh Sekhon who was recently appointed as the Indian boxing Coach today turned in his resignation when his name sprung up in a disturbing doping racket ... the substances in question were banned by the National Doping agency in 2008 ... Waryam Singh Sekhon has been found guilty in a doping scandal that rocked the Indian boxing federation today ... the banned substances would be ordered from Malaysia and would be mixed into the diet of some unsuspecting favoured athletes ... ANSI is yet to come out with an official statement ... He is not at the stadium. He isn't answering his phone either. Is he romancing with that girl? Go, check his room. Rocky, are you alright? Hey. Hi. Joker. What's up? Ready to rumble? What happened? What happened, Rocky? They aren't keeping me in team India. What do you mean by they aren't keeping you? The final selection is yet to be done. I won't be selected. Who told you that? Okay, don't be sad over such a small thing. I'll get you selected. Okay? I know the sports minister. I'll talk to him. I don't need your charity. I am not doing you a favor. I just wanna help. Do I stand in askance. You are India's best boxer in your weight category. You have the right to play in the team. If you get selected, what difference does it make how you got selected? Right's aren't passed around in chariy . We done? Listen I'm not Preet who'll quietly listen to whatever you say. Do whatever you want to, see what I care. Listen, I'm sorry but it gets so hard to get through to you. I was just trying to... Ibaadat, i am sorry. I didn't purposely, Ibaadat, Don't you dare come near me, don't, touch me, leave, leave Both players come forward. No hitting below the belt. No clinching. I want a clean fight. Okay? Life isn't the time you spend inside the ring. Life isn't a game outside the ring. Life sometimes makes you lose. No matter how prepared you are. Defeat is important in the game of life. Defeat teaches you how to win. Rajdeep, you are one of the best boxers in the country. But you won't get selected, son. You should always behave like an India level sportsman. A novice's carelessness doesn't suit you. People want... to see you fall. Don't fall, son. Rocky! No! Preet! Preet! Rocky, our brother is dead. 'I am not my father's son if I don't make you cry.' Preet! He was as dear to me as he was to you. Why have you left me, complaints grievances are both a part of life I don't want to go to the police. Drop me home. Shouldn't I leave you with Rocky instead? Ma'am? What's the boy's name? Rocky. Rocky who? Mental. Go wait in the car. I don't have the status to reason it with the minister. But if you could reconsider? This is just bringing in trouble to yourself. You don't have the status to giving me advice either. Do your job. Don't try to be a lawyer. Rocky, everything in life is falling into place. I sometimes fear that someone might ruin it all. Forget fearing that. You forget that I can die for you. I convinced Seerat to marry me. That foolish girl? She is so talkative. Don't say a word about her. You two would look good together. Squirel and kitten. After commonwealth, you will be a star in India. Will you attend your ordinary friend's wedding? I'll go to Bholu's uncle's younger son's wedding too. These tears weep their testimonies of our love I'll go to the grave with you, sweetheart. If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine Why have you left me, complaints grievances are both a part of life Losing a beloved permanently casts a morbid restlessness in life Why have you left me, complaints grievances are both a part of life Losing a beloved permanently casts a morbid restlessness in life You had said you would always be by my side You lost your word today These tears weep their testimonies of our love Why was your friendship so short lived I would have never let you walk out of my life If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine If breaking iron at the gym ..and consuming protein supplements had the minutest relevance in life.. ..all the influential people in our area would decorate.. ..you with laurels and get pictures clicked with you. But if someone asks you to get on a tractor and split an acre ..in half you would drive my name into the ground. To avenge you, Get to it I had removed all possible obstacles. I would've made the person who spilled Shergill's blood.. ..bleed to death drop by drop. But you don't trust your brother's promises anymore. If you wanted to do it the crude way.. ..then why did you make me call the SSP? You should've taken God's name and gone for the kill inside the boxing ring itself. You crossed my instruction. We didn't talk about killing Rocky. He was as dear to me as he was to you. You... Have a taste of gold, dear. Our friendship lasted 8 years. I don't think you are well versed with politics, Mr. Shergill. You shouldn't pamper your subjects too much ... they get reckless. Slaving the reckless is child's play. And not the problem. The problem is finding an apt punishment for subjects who dare steal their ruler's prey These threats can only scare your party workers, Mr. Shergill. City bred kids cannot control wild bulls. And you should worry about your position and power. I wiped my enemies name from the headlines. Now the law and the media will get involved. To find the murderers. Be alert, Mr. Shergill. Don't be so careless this time. Your garb looks wrinkled. You should keep it starched. I'm glad you came. I was just about to leave. Rocky... Hey stupid... This is an Indian star's life. It won't give up that easy. Preet... He's been charged with attempting to rape a university student. When the girl tried to stop Rocky, he brutally attacked her. An inspiration for Punjab's youth has shamed all Punjabis today. Rocky, do you regret what you did? Share your thoughts with the people of Punjab. They trusted you and you betrayed them. What relationship did you have with the girl you tried to rape? Boxer, gangster or a rapist. Which character is ruling you at the movement? Is this deed a result of illegal drugs given by Waryam Singh Sekhon? Rocky? Rocky, say something. Rocky? - Rocky, say something. Rocky, please? Our ancestors would say that man can brave storms riding on the shoulders of calamity,.. ..and in his determination even stand up to the gods. Mr. Inderpal, everyone faces difficult times. You shouldn't lose courage. But what courage can one conjour when your children are in such darkness? Parents become helpless. Ibadat doesn't say anything. She just cries inside her locked room. Consider my concern legitimate, Mr. Shergill. When even close relatives are trying to avoid us.. ..you have come forth with a marriage proposal. We cannot take any decision without talking to Ibadat first. Ibadat? Ibadat? Ibadat? What's wrong with you? Mr. Shergill, I apologize for my daughter's mistake. Sit down, child. Sit down. Maninder? Son, I don't know what's going on between the two of you. The glorious heritage of my forefathers is going to be inherited by this wimp. Getting punched and slapped gives him kicks. You're daughters here. It's important to address all concerns To decipher the illegitimate from the legitimate. And to critically consider the illegitimate one's Then we will get her engaged to my little brother. Sign here. Prisoner's name? Rajdeep Singh. Rajdeep... Rocky. He is a boxer. He's just come to his in-law's a mere four days ago. Let the family at least celebrate their rituals. Sometimes his mother shows up, sometimes his grandfather. Heed my advice and scram from here. He won't meet anyone. We have passed on many messages. Go away! If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine I would happily spill my blood for you Your memories rattle me, I cry day and night I would happily spill my blood for you Your memories rattle me, I cry day and night To whose stubbornness will I bow my head now This encounter of breaths ends here I guess Whose friendship will I turn to now I would have never let you walk out of my life If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine If you would have ordered I would have given my life for you But would have never let you walk out of mine But would have never let you walk out of mine Why did you not order me to What nonsense are you up to? Brother... We were just fooling around, playing tailing the monkey. Should I turn you into a monkey? No, brother. Today... it's Gagan's turn. Brother is here. Be ready. Yes, I am here only to make fun of, right? Brother, if you could take Frooti along...? There's one more option. There's a new scapegoat. Let's use him. He's a rapist. We'll enjoy devouring him. He's tall and well built. Let's turn him into a monkey. Should I turn you into a monkey? Let's go already. Hey NO. Do you feel the heat, champion? Yes come again. Really? "He has caught the bug!" God bless you. He's caught his eye. It's his turn now. And I always await heaven. Brother, don't you think it's getting too trashy here? Lift your hooves! Why do you ask him? Hit it hard and move ahead. Nonsense. 'Rocky, let go of my hand.' Stop trying to be my parent Stop blowing the trumpet on our friendship I'm not dancing to your tunes anymore Preet, what is this childishness? You are my life. Your obstinacy is manliness. And my obstinacy is childishness? My future belongs to you? My past belongs to you? Decisions, friendships, you have a right over everything? At least let my life be my own. Don't take away my right to live it or end it. I swear on God, I am so pleased to see you like this. Damn you, you look so charming in your misery. People are dogs. They take pleasure out of sorrow. They say that Rocky pees and shits in his pants now. He spends his day scraping the wall with his nails. They love to hurt the injured. Ibadat and I are getting married. This is the first invite. Keep it. At least pick it up. Scoundrel, you made such a big enemy. You should payback at least a little. If no punches then how about a cuss or two? Or Rocky accept that you are not a man. Beg to me. May be then you won't die like your friend did. But you'll really have to beg me. Is there any attitude left? If there is any left, then my men will take care of it in the prison. You just don't try and stifle your screams. I heard your friend at the end shrieked a lot. Devinder is rather cruel. Imagine, he hanged that poor boy. But don't worry. I give you my word. We won't give you the death your friend got. Your punishment will be more severe. Hats off to your make? What a monkey! You know everyone teases me with your name. Oh yes, Shergill's brother was here yesterday. He asked me to take good care of you. I think he too loves this deadly face. He killed him! He killed my husband like brother! This pervert deserved to die! Brother, we are all here in your support. Don't move forward. We three aren't going to take any steps. Look Mental... Mental, stay... Mental... At least tell me what his name is! Everyone calls me Mental. You should have asked why I am called so! We will now go and talk to him. Sir, please tell us... We want to know, sir... No regret on his face, no sadness in his eyes. His gait was virile and his eyes challenged section 354. as Rocky's body language suggested.. ..as he just entered the court. Rajdeep Singh alias Rocky ill-famed at the sports hostel.. ..for womanizing and hooliganism.. ..has come to Patiala court for his hearing today. Rajdeep Singh! Rajdeep Singh! I don't think you understand the seriousness of this case. If you did, all your attention would have been here. Mr. Brar, the national champion you are fighting for.. ..forget regretting his crime, he doesn't even have the realization of committing it. Once the wedding day is so close.. ..girls from decent families don't meet their future husbands. And you like a fool were going to meet your lover? Your beauty is fading. I'll make sure you are bathed in your lover's blood. I can't even imagine, how pretty you would look then. Brother, Rocky... Brother, your disk must only come back after kissing a few fairies? Oh yea Will you check yourself, Be careful not to drop your eyeballs in the act. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Don't take it to your heart, darling. When the time is tough, you have to endure swords too. These were mere words. Order me. Tell me, what should I do with Shergill? Take your revenge, buddy. No? You have gone soft? I spoke to Maninder Shergill. I kept your case before him too. He told me he had bad blood with Rocky. Tell me Preet Singh, how do we go about it? Maninder Shergill wants to resolve this once and for all. Husk often gets crushed along with the wheat. Let me go... Let me go... What are you doing? Getting you up in the headlines Let me go Our friendship goes back 8 years. Can't abandon you like this. You don't get fairer overnight. Look at him. He has an early morning flight to catch but boy is he enjoying his facewashes . He schemed his way into the Commonwealth games. That too to Australia. Brother, shall I get a scrubber? You should scrub all the darkness away. Run away, scoundrels. Or I will catch the color of your ugly faces. Okay, brother. You have a good one yea. See you in the morning. Good night. I lost it all, coach. What life and what game. Now tell me, what do I win over ... Preet They took everything from me. Made me a criminal. No, son. Don't lose hope. You will surrender to the police in the morning. You shouldn't have run away. We will stay within the boundaries of law and fight. I gave up fighting in the ring itself. Players win and lose. Criminals... kill and die. The law can't catch me dead And I am not destined to die. He is my nephew, Rajdeep. He stays with me with his mother. His mother has gone through a tough time. Alcohol killed her husband. And hooliganism killed her eldest son. She now spends her days praying. Rajdeep doesn't listen to her. And he doesn't heed my advice either. He fights at home, at school and in the village. If he isn't guided to the right path.. ..he'd ruin his own life and his mother's like his brother did. Help me. In which grade are you, Rajdeep? Sixth. Do you like going to school? Do you teach wrestling? You like wrestling? Mother doesn't let me watch it at home. I watch it at Binder's place. No one is here to fight as yet? This is boxing, son. It isn't fought. It is played. You get hurt? Yes, sometimes. A little. Even your players? What punishment do you give to those who get hurt? I don't punish. I teach them how to play. My brother used to beat me up when I used to get hurt. My brother was shot to death with 8 bullets by two boys from Balian village. Will I be able to kill them if I learn to box? What happened? Answer it already! What does he say? The taxi driver is getting on my nerves. Take it in writing. - What? He must be applying creams. - Yes. Let's go upstairs and get him. - Let's go. Let's go. I'll... Brother! Brother! Hello? He is praying. They have found two boys dead in the campus. These images are from ANSI campus.. ..where two players have been found hanging dead You must have never seen Such brutal deaths before. Baljeet Singh, who was scheduled to go to Australia for the Commonwealth games.. ..was found hanging from a height of 30 feet. Whereas Devinder, a state discus champion.. ..was hung from the top of a 250 feet tall stadium. Police say that Rocky who ran from police custody yesterday.. ..is responsible for their murders. the Patiala SSP has assured everyone that.. ..the culprit will be arrested by today evening. Maninder has all the men looking for Rocky. Where is Maninder? - He's Out. Maninder? You are getting married tomorrow. Your friends and family are waiting for you. Brother, tell them to wait. Maninder is going to kill his enemy today and dance all night. Rocky, why aren't you saying anything? I'm talking my heart out. But today, you can't hear it. You are under my oath. Take me away from here. I will die. I don't want to marry Maninder. Your earlier accusation destroyed my life I can't bear responsibility for your murder Rocky, I am so sorry. Your entire college called me by a name. You know why they called me that right! Remove your last names from behind your cars. Four men together beat up one person? Here is a true Jatt! And this is his fight for revenge. Judgments by courts cant stop him. He will only accept a death warrant issued by his enemy. Scoundrels, did you pull out his tongue? He's not even whimpering. You dribble like a dog for sure. But you still bite like a puppy. What a Jatt. Cornered in a trap yet he holds his head high. Bow your head and show some shame at least. And it'll be easier to cut it off. Who gets cornered in a trap and who lays the trap is just a matter of perspective. You came sniffing for me with your head bowed to die at my hands. I couldn't burn my brother's pyre But here I burnt your's. Kill them all. Wait, Bring the girl to me. Give me another one. She's been waiting for you to cajole her. She isn't getting salve for her open wounds. Rocky! My younger brother used to be just as stubborn. Rocky! My brother's screams echo in the darkness. I am a Jatt just like you. I'll color tomorrow's dawn with her blood. Save her if you can. My men are eager to take a bite off her. See that now. Like sweat I wiped off all my enemies today Like sweat I wiped off all my enemies today - CATCH HIM These honorable warriors are born from the grain of the earth There is only 1 in a 100 who will fight unto death for his principles Those who move mountains verbally are inept of changing the course of winds But I am going to do the impossible such is my belief in myself Like sweat I wiped off all my enemies today Like sweat I wiped off all my enemies today Rocky! He shouldn't get away now. Rocky are you alright? I knew you'd come Rocky "Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! This is the end for you. Enough of this! A true man will never lose Jackal's will run from the battlefield at the roars of lions Lions are lions not because of their coat But their hearts Friends this is the concrete truth The first and the last statement 'Rocky, brother...' 'This is India's star's life.' 'It won't give up that easily.' 'Not today Preet, not anymore.' Did Rocky ever contact you after that night? Any information about him from anywhere? No one knows anything about him. Last night police killed a guy in an encounter. Police won't identify his body. Police can't catch Rocky dead. 'And I am not destined to die.' And he isn't destined to die. Watch out here I come x4 Watch out here I come x4 Watch out here I come x4 SO did you feel the heat champions? "Desi crew!" "Desi crew!" "Desi crew!" "Desi crew!"
