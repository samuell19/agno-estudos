My lords and gentlemen, since you were last assembled, I have declared my intention of allying myself in marriage unto prince Albert of saxe-coburg and gotha. I humbly implore the divine blessing may prosper this union and render it conducive to the interests of my people as well as to my own domestic happiness, and it will be to me a source of the most lively satisfaction to find the resolution I have made taken and approved by my parliament. It isn't good enough Wellington. The prince is yet a stranger to the people and we're asked to provide him with a large income. And I don't think parliament will stand for it or the country. Well I'm against appeal. After all, we've got to be very careful. Only a few years back we barely escaped revolution. Why they stole apsley house with me inside it. Well, I'm proposing a reduction of the Grant by nearly half. And I'm dead against this idea of making him an English peer. Yes. It'll be misunderstood. Yes, quite right. No, it's nothing personal. - Apologies of course. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Of course, course, course. Well, I suppose he's on his way now. Well I hope he keeps fine for his journey. Oh Albert, I've been wanting to ask you for a long time, what does it feel like to be proposed to? Oh, I was nervous. You see, I was standing on the one side of the table and I didn't know what to do. I just had to wait. And she was standing on the other side of the table, and didn't know how to begin. Finally she showed me the family album. And you had to look at all the old uncles and aunts? I bet uncle Leopold was there too? Yes sir. Oh she was so nervous and so sweet. And now to look forward to your new country. I'm glad Ernst the final partings over. The whole journey has been one long farewell. Every field, and every hill, and every villy seems to be bidding me goodbye. You'll be welcomed. You'll be loaded by honours. That's a good beginning. The Duke of Wellington has opposed my rank. And the English parliament is nearly half the allowance of they were to give to me. I don't seem to be very welcomed. Of course you will be welcomed. You'll take the rightful place at the head of affairs beside the queen. The English are doing everything they can to make me unwelcomed. You mustn't allow such thoughts to enter your head. And it's a fact Ernst, it's a fact they don't want me. Don't you see Albert, within a few weeks you'll be the husband of a girl queen who rules over one of the greatest country in the world. What a responsibility and what a chance. Yes, what a chance. Her majesty wishes to see the prince in the drawing room immediately. But lehzen, you think I should see the prince with my hair like this? In curls? Yes, it looks charming. You do not think he will be shocked? No, I think not. Oh Albert, there you are. Although I have not a moment today, what, with my work and the dressmakers. I had to spare you a few minutes just to tell you that all the arrangements for our marriage are now complete. And I am very happy. Don't you think we should reconsider the whole question? I feel it is better to draw back now than to go on to what must be a failure. Albert, what do you mean? But Victoria nobody here seems to wish me. I'm resented. My presence in the country's objected to, and well, I fear for the future. And I think it's better to face it now than afterward. Then why did you accept my proposal of marriage? For a very simple reason. Because I love you. Oh, it you weren't queen I would allow nothing to come between you and me. Then nothing shall Albert. I too love you. And our love will be done all opposition. They shall be made to respect you and you shall take your rightful place. Whatever happens, whatever people say, I will marry you. On Victoria, you are so good and kind to me that I'm puzzled to believe that I should be the object of so much affection. Now I must leave you. Oh, Albert? Yes. In england, we do not say "nobody wishes me," we say, "nobody wants me." Oh, thank you. You've made me very happy your majesty to know that even if nobody here wants me, you do. Albert. Will thou have this woman Victoria to thy wedded wife, to live together after god's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Will thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? I will. Will thou Victoria have this man Albert to thy wedded husband, to live together after god's ordinance in the holt estate of matrimony? Will thou obey him and serve him, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness and in health, so long as ye both shall live? I will. With this ring I thee wed. With this ring I thee wed. Do you remember the evening we danced then you wore. Yes Albert. It's a beautiful dance. The waltz. How the young people do enjoy it. Are we so very old? I'm 21 Albert. Yes, very old. Old enough to know that it would be improper for a married woman to dance the waltz. Oh. Fine trouble Wellington. Yes, but I'm in her bad book spiel. For opposing his rank. And I for opposing his allowance. How I wish I were an ancient Greek goddess who lived on Olympus. What? I should like to hurl a thunderbolt. Who is it, peel or Wellington? Both. Albert. I'll shall catch their eye and convey that in a look. They have seen me Albert. I think they wish they hadn't. Mr. Strauss does play this waltz tune better than anyone else. Yes he does. Albert, I feel I would like to dance. What? A married woman at 21? Albert, I think I am going to dance. Most improper. Albert, we will dance. They're in the green drawing room windsor Wellington. Awaiting her majesty's pleasure. Oh I remember. Albert! A bullseye! Now you. Oh, but it is so difficult. Come on, I'll show it to you. Give me your hand. Albert, this is england. I know, and I love it. You know, I think I'm going to like archery. Are you? Oh is that right? No that's not right. So here. Albert. I know, that is england, I know. Now aim. And aim high, remember lot for the win. It is so difficult. No, go on, go on. You know, I understand the queen's in the grounds. I think I'll venture out a tactful reminder that we're here. Brave fellow. I'll wait here. Happy dreams. Did I tell you Victoria, my private secretary from coburg has arrived in London? He wants to know when they shall come here. But my dear, I have already arranged a secretary for you. Arranged? But of course Albert, it would never do for the husband of the queen to select his own secretary. That is a matter for me to decide. On Victoria, I'm here in the country, where everything is new and strange to me. The people, the custom, the language-- nobody knows that and understands and sympathises more than I do. Well then surely I may be allowed to have one man with me. Merely to look after my private affairs, whom I've known all my life and can trust. It's more important that you should have someone that the queen knows and can trust. Uh huh. Albert, I must tell you frankly, this idea of having your own secretary, a foreigner, simply will not do. Mr. Anson whom I have chosen for you is modest, steady, and well-informed. I have no doubt your Mr. Anson's perfect, but he can never mean the same to me as an old friend who is already in england. Then he must go back. At once. Your majesty. Your royal highness. Sir Robert. I'm extremely conscious ma'am that it is a great shame to interrupt so pleasant a pastime, but I'm here ma'am with the Duke of Wellington. We could scarcely have had two more unwelcomed visitors. Oh your majesty. And that look of pained surprise is quite unnecessary. We have recently been subjected to a gross, deliberate, and unforgivable affront. And you and the Duke of Wellington were ringleaders and instigators. Your majesty, if I might be permitted to say one word in defence of the Duke. He only did what he considered to be his duty. Duty? As a soldier ma'am. That is hardly my idea of a soldiers duty. It's more the action of a rebel, an old rebel. Oh, your majesty is deadly with a bow as well I see. Albert, a bullseye! Remarkable. I will rejoin the Duke ma'am. We will await your pleasure. That is exactly what they will do, await my pleasure. Oh really Victoria? Sir Robert and the Duke are two of the greatest men of our time. You say that Albert? When he was against you all their insults were directed. But don't you see Victoria... No I do not see! And I do not want to see anything! I'm sorry. You're back soon. It's not soon enough for her majesty. We're to wait. Wait is it? Yes. She's as obstinate as a wagon-load of monkeys. Well, let her try her tricks on me. Now I know why she calls you the old rebel. She calls me what? The old rebel. Rebel? Rebel is it? Old rebel. Good morning your royal highness. Who are you? My name is anson, your private secretary. Anson? Yes. Uh huh. Good day. Wellington. I didn't come here to listen to a concert! My lady, have you managed to hit the target yet? Of course I have, the bullseye. And without looking. Don't ask ridiculous questions lehzen. Leave me alone. Yes your majesty. Rebel. Old rebel. Morning lehzen. Well, what do you want now? Nothing your majesty. The prince desires me to tell you that he wishes to see you. Tell the prince I will not receive him today and I do not wish to be disturbed by any further messages! Yes your majesty. Her majesty does not wish to see you. And she does not wish to be disturbed by any further messages. So. Go away, go away! I do not wish to see you. I know. I want to be left alone. I'll leave you in a minute. But first you must listen to what I have to say. Albert, you forget yourself, I am the queen. Oh no my dear, when you're alone with me you are nothing but my wife. Then I will go. Victoria. If you don't want my help in matters of state, or if you don't want me to have my own secretary, well in good, that's your affair. But when I see you slighting two great men, taking advantage of your position-... Well Albert, don't. Please don't. You behave like a naughty little girl, not like a queen. I know. I know I did. There's humility in all real greatness. Oh Albert, please forgive me. You hate me don't you? No I don't hate you. I love you. I love you very much. And I love you Albert, very, very much. Who is there? Your majesty, do you wish sir Duke and sir Robert to wait? Oh no lehzen, let them be dismissed. No, no. One moment lehzen. You should see them. Should I? Yes, certainly. Oh lehzen, I will see them. Immediately. In the library. In the library lehzen. Blow your nose darling. Soft, soft. And because you kept them waiting such a long time, you'll be especially charming, yes? Yes Albert. Promise? You shall see how charming I can be. She shall not go to this review on a horse. She'll ride like any decent woman in her carriage. You'll have to be firm. Firm is it! My dear Bob, when it comes to anything connected with the troops, I'm not going to be dictated to by a chit of a girl. Queen or no queen. No. I will receive the Duke and sir Robert immediately. She's been reading about queen Elizabeth, at tilbury, a horseback. That's what's put it into her head! Well? Well, we've got to get it out of her head. Sounds simple. Oh of course it is. I'll say my little say, set myjaw, and she'll ride in her carriage. My lord Duke, sir Robert, her majesty will see you. Oh. Now for it. Now we come to it, you're as nervous as I am. Not a bit of it. But I tell you Bob, I'm glad I didn't feel like this before Waterloo. Yes, but you won that. Surely, now for this. Come on! And please, don't forget, very charming hm? Your majesty. Oh pray pardon me gentlemen, for having kept you waiting so long. It was remiss of me. Not at all ma'am. Oh but it was. I had a matter of some importance to discuss with the prince. Oh, your majesty, ma'am, the Duke has a matter of some importance to discuss with you. Well my lord Duke. I hear ma'am you have some idea of reviewing the troops on horseback. And why not? Why not? Well it is, it's impossible. And why? Why? Well, it will be indelicate. Indelicate. The queen is as good a judge of indelicacy as you are my lord Duke. What if it rains? Well... What would happen if it rains? I should get wet. What next? I haven't got a quired horse. I do not want a quired horse. Ma'am really, really, I must protest. Protest! Just because queen Elizabeth... Queen Elizabeth? Please explain yourself me lord Duke. What exactly has queen Elizabeth to do with this? Nothing ma'am. Nothing. I thought not. Good day my lord Duke. Good day ma'am. Good day sir Robert. Good day ma'am. Remember me lord Duke, no horse, no review. Yes ma'am. No ma'am. Wellington. Yes. She said her little say, she said her little jaw, and she rode her little horse. Ah. Oh anson. Sir. Who is boz? It's a pen name of a new author named Charles dickens. Charles dickens? You think that's all true? I believe it is sir. He lives among the people he writes about. Oh. The prince is expecting me. Not until tomorrow sir. But he's in the palace. His royal highness is in the drawing room sir. Albert! Ernst! So that's what a father looks like huh? Your highness, her majesty is waiting. Thank you. You stay here behind the door. We give her a surprise hm? But I must have a wash first. No you need no wash. Alright. Sure it's a wee blossom of a babe. But sometimes I can't help myself feeling, I'd of been more happy had it been a little girl if it had been a little boy. By gone, but the prince himself is pleased enough about it being a lass. It's made him more daft about the queen than ever. He won't allow nobody but himself to carry her downstairs. And the back stairs at that. Your royal highness, if I can be of any service whilst you're here-... Oh thank you Mr. Anson, the prince has plenty of work to occupy himself with I see. I'm afraid his royal highness has a very difficult position to fill. He has such a fine mind, but-... Oh he'll soon take his rightful place beside the queen. Depends upon what your royal highness means by his rightful place. Ernst! Victoria. Oh what a happy surprise. Albert did not tell me you were here. Yes. And I'm all dirty from my travelling. But Albert insisted upon me seeing you first. Would you permit me now to leave? Oh but of course, hurry back Ernst. We have so much to tell you. And you must see little Vicky. You've never seen such a beautiful baby. Oh I'm sure of that. Lehzen, send them all away and have them bring the baby Princess to me. Your majesty. You know Albert, if I could travel the world from end to end, in the most beautiful carriage ever imagined, it could not be more lovelier than the journey down the back stairs in your arms. Now you rest quietly while I go and play to you hm? I shall enjoy that. Have you ever heard of an author named Charles dickens Victoria? Yes I've heard of him. Rather evolutionary is he not? Mm hm. But he makes me think of the many thousands of other mothers and fathers who are not so fortunate as we are, whose babies are not born in a palace. But are destined to poverty, starvation, and overwork. His writing makes me want to do something, to help, something, something really useful. Whose lot it is to labour and earn their bread by the sweat of their brow! When they shall recruit their exhausted strength with abundant and untaxed food! If he feels that his being here lends royal support to this most controversial measure, then he must be made aware that his presence in this house is most objectionable. Sir Robert, I have asked you to come and see me here because I do not wish the prince to know. Your majesty. He's ceaseless, unjust attacks against him are making me so unhappy. I do not want him to know how unhappy. I am deeply sympathetic ma'am. Oh I know that sir Robert. That is why I am appealing to you now because you have been his onalest supporter. Can you devise some scope, some outlet, something to justify his existence? Even if only to himself? Since my resignation ma'am, of course I have no power. But with your majesty's permission, I might consult with the Duke of Wellington, there should be... The Duke! That is an excellent idea. Please remember sir Robert, I do not wish the prince to know of our discussion. It would be an honour indeed if I knew that your royal highness were to be my successor as commander in chief. Well you are very kind and generous my lord Duke. But it'll never do. After all, we owe the inauguration of the militia and the volunteers to you. May I suggest that you discuss it with her majesty? No, no, no. It would only make her unhappy. She knows of the position there is to any of my activities. But, may I tell you of a plan of mine and ask you your opinion on it? I should regard it as an honour. You see, as we are living through an age of great scientific and mechanical discovery... What? As we are living through an age of great scientific and mechanical discoveries, I thought we might gather together here in London. All the nations of the world. It would be in the nature of a great exhibition of industry where each could show to all the others how they're progressing. Magnificent idea. You think anybody could object to it? No, no, no, no, it's non-political. Why should they? On the contrary, everybody would be delighted to welcome such a scheme. There is an article here your majesty. Of his royal highness' exhibition of industry and a great deal about it. Oh read it to me please. Yes ma'am. I'm waiting. Well I think perhaps your majesty would rather not hear it. Not hear it? Don't be ridiculous. Come, let me read it myself. "This monstrous greenhouse, "this overgrown conservatory." 11 and a half miles of table. Bless my soul. Albert... Oh the young lady, you're here. We're having a great day. All the leading manufacturers of the country have agreed to corporate. And the colonists, in every country in Europe. And here it is. 1,073,760 square feet of glass. And within the building, 11 miles of table. 11 and a half sir. Oh yes I'm sorry. 11 and a half. But Albert, have you seen what the newspapers say about your exhibition? No. "A monstrous greenhouse. "An overgrown conservatory. "A preposterous and grotesque advertisement "that anybody can see through. "Though it's own glass may soon become dirty "with the grime of London." Can't bare to stand the real purpose of it. That it must promote a better understanding between all the peoples. Such a text is so ignorant as to be unworthy of our attention. That's the spirit ma'am. I need to find the spirit your husband's shown these last months with half the country howling at his heels. A man with less courage would have thrown it out long ago. Whatever they say I shall go on and bring it to success. And you can count on me sir! We'll have the whole army behind your royal highness. The exhibition will be open, open on the appointed day. And it'll be a day we'll remember for the rest of our lives! In declaring this finest of exhibitions opened, I want to say that it seems to me, one of the great days in our history. And the triumph of my beloved husband. So I declare this exhibition open. Or as it has been so rightly called, this crystal palace. Dear Duke, a glorious day. Glorious indeed your majesty. The real worth of the prince has been at last appreciated in this magnificent manner. And may I add my tribute your royal highness. It is a great triumph. Thank you. And a great work for peace. No, I've seen enough of fighting to know that to keep friendly with your neighbours is about the most important thing in the world. Oh my dear Duke. Your majesty. I am so happy Victoria that I could do some work and they appreciate it. And I Albert. And now all the criticism will be silenced and you will take your rightful place in the affairs of the nation. I had expected news of the dear Duke. I do hope he is better. I shouldn't worry my dear. No news is good news. Did she smile? Me lord Duke. Did you tell her how they wanted him? Yes, he's just coming. Here he is now. Oh. Harvey? My lord Duke. I want to write a letter to the queen. To tell her I'm better. Give me my things. Something to write on. I am very lazy today. Disinclined to do anything. I think I'll have a nap first. You know Albert, I'm so looking foward to the children's dances. Your majesty, I'm to tell you that we'd be glad if you judged the barons dancing and award the prizes yourself. I should be delighted brown. Thank you. I'll tell them. Listen, all of ya! I'll have to tell you her majesty will be very glad to judge the barons dancing and award the prizes herself. Albert, look at our own laddie. Does he not dance beautifully? Yes, beautiful. I think he's the best. What? The best? Yes Albert, he is the best. I shall award him the first prize. Oh no, you can't possibly do that, even if he is the best. Look at that fellow over there. The blacksmith's boy. Jamie gow? Why he is not nearly so good. Albert we must be impartial. You haven't looked at any of the others yet. Oh how can I when our own boy dances so beautifully? I shall award him the first prize. Your majesty will be pleased to name the winner of the first prize? Yes brown. The winner is his... Jamie gow. Albert. Her majesty is pleased to award the first prize to Jamie gow! And the second prize ma'am? His royal highness. And the second prize to his royal highness. You see Albert, the cheering is much Wilder. He was the best. Will Jamie gow and his royal highness please come forward to receive their prizes from her majesty? If that letter to the queen is going to catch the post, he must write it now. Better wake him then, it's been on his mind all morning. My lord Duke. My lord Duke. My dear prime minister, the tsar is looking west. I've been long-suffering as befits a country that is not invalid. But now the British lion's got to do a little roaring. It's a dangerous spirit. Only more dangerous still and that is not to stand up when you're in danger. The queen always says you exaggerate palmerston, and she's right. With a little concession we might... Concession. Oh my dear Russell you are like those two young innocents at windsor. You think that one can reach safety by feeding outlets to a tiger. Or buns to a bear. You're too picturesque. Only facts count. And the fact is, tsar has sent the queen this letter, which bears every Mark of his sincere desire to preserve the peace of Europe. So long as this country is anything or has anything, we shall go one receiving from yours truly, or yours sincerely. Beware of "yours very sincerely" Russell. I am obliged to you ma'am for letting me see the tsar's letter. A very cordial, even affectionate one is it not? Is it genuine? You mean that he is looking west? He is not a sick man and he has a good appetite. Constantinople. If that were really the case, well John, although we're so limited unprepared for what we should... Not until every possibility of a peaceful solution has been exhausted. Of course you must pursue conciliation and peace to the end. That's why palmerston's present utterance is a disaster. He is a difficult man to control. Then he must be controlled! If he can't control himself. I have been accused, and accused in high places of being more indifferent than I should to the risks of war. My answer to that lies in the past. Though a man can speak for the future, There is a country in Europe which has been called a sick man. Good. And the tsar summoning himself to the bedside, Calls himself the doctor. But we know better. Shall this country stand timid, defenceless at the back door, while the robber, violent, threatening, and arrogant is breaking his way in at the front? No! Palmerston says it's time we went to war! And palmerston's right! Is palmerston British! He's not a foreign traitor in the pocket of the tsar! What's he gotta do with his royal highness whether we go to war or not? That's what we wanna know! Who's the man for us! And who's the traitor! John, this demonstration, what is it for? Your majesty, your royal highness, it is not exactly for anything. What's it about? Rather against something. Against what? Am I to answer that question quite frankly your majesty? Against what? Against you your royal highness. Against me. Against the prince? Without reserve lord John, we must know the whole truth. Your majesty, your royal highness, the fact is, well, palmerston's regarded as the one strong man in the country. It is thought that the prince is trying to get rid of him for his own ends. Own ends, for what ends? The prince is said to be a foreign agent. An avowed enemy of this country. A tool of the tsar. Sinister shadow behind the throne. What? This is unbelievable. You must believe it your majesty. There is even a rumour that the prince is to be arrested for treason and taken to the tower. Treason? Tower? But a great crowd's already around the palace waiting to see him taken there a prisoner. Oh my dear. We've known something of this of course. But the prince is so uncomplaining. The injustice of it is making him ill, wearing him out. We know that your majesty. All of us will work with him. These attacks are groundless and contemptible, but the country is wild with rage and fear, and that brings me to the real object of my visit. I have to inform you your majesty that within the last few hours, war has become inevitable. All our work in vain. All the notes, the letters, the dispatches. So much ink wasted. Inevitable? Beyond hope. So be it. This is like living in the meadows. Oi. That there ole tsar were right he were when he said that his two best generals be January and February. Blimey, to think I used to play in snowballs. If ever I gets out of here I never wanna see a blinking snowflake again. You'll never get out of here lad. None of us will. Bulls in rock here. No, I never see dorset no more. Nor me the old Kent road, never no more. I wonder how long they're gonna expect them to fight on this mud. Dry biscuits and dirty water. Anyhow, they call this soup. Number one company, load musket! Load and our pouch is empty. Perhaps you'd like to tell us what to load with. Fix your bayonets. Hey Darcy, do you know what this blinking war's all about? No I don't. And nor do I. Nor does anybody as far as I can see. Funny ain't it? And I do say ma'am, that one of the clever ones has invented some new stuff. Chloroform I've heard tell. And they gives it to you and you goes to sleep and they can cut off your leg and you don't feel nothing. I reckon if that's true, he must be one of the greatest men that ever lived. We never saw nothing of this stuff. It didn't reach us. Four of them had to hold me down to cut this off through flesh and bone. That's enough, her majesty doesn't want to hear anymore. If he were brave enough to bare it, I can bare to hear about it. You say this new chloroform never reached you? Ma'am, more than chloroform never reached us, food didn't reach us, nor ammunition, nor boots, nor clothes. We'll win for you alright ma'am. Don't you worry about that. But when you ask to fight four against one, with nothing on your feet and nothing in your gun and nothing in your belly... Now, now, now, you're talking too much. But not complaining ma'am. Don't you think that. I'm one of the lucky ones! Back in old england with me wife and kids waiting for me when they gets out. Your majesty, he oughtn't talk anymore. No, no. He'll soon be back with his wife and children I hope. Never your royal highness. Gangrene, the wound was hopelessly poisoned before he came to us. Have they none of the new antiseptics of Dr. Lister? No sir. They're not in general use yet. How terrible. Albert how terrible. There she goes! Come on boys! Give her three cheers! Three cheers for her majesty and the prince! Hip hip hooray! Hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! It's all a lot of show. What does she care, she's not suffering. She ain't got nobody out there. She's not lost her husband. Nor her son. Did you see that? She was crying. Me lord, you take office at a time dark with anxiety and danger. But the whole country feels and we feel that you are the man for the hour. All personal differences must be forgotten lord palmerston. But I want you to know that whatever you do will have our full support. May god help you in your efforts. Would your majesty like it strike in gold or silver? No, I wish it to be made from a base metal. A metal from the gun itself. Excellent ma'am. Yes, I think it will be well if it had no real value. The inscription proposed is, "for the bravest." No. No, they're all brave. Possibly the bravest of the least brave. I think it would be better if it bore just the words... Commander Buckley, we have been informed of your acts of valour. We congratulate you upon your return from sevastopol unscathed. Miss nightingale, we are proud to meet you. We women were not meant for governing, but you with your nursing have given a shining example of our greatest mission. I only did what I had to ma'am. Will you accept this gift, not only as a token of my own gratitude, but the gratitude of the whole country? You may leave us, I will pour tea myself. Look at the line of those years. How lovely and how like coburg. Yes, for me this will always be the most beautiful view in the world. And this hour for tea Albert, alone with you, away from all cares of state, away even from the children. Just look at them playing soldiers. Are they all there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. No Albert, there are only seven. No, you are mistaken. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight. Oh yes, I had not seen the bassinet. And nine. Where is Vicky? Albert, did you see that? A declaration. But she's so young, only 16. I was queen at 18. He is the most excellent young man. Most suitable. Seems only yesterday she was in her cradle. Yes, our first baby. And you think they love each other? But of course. How nervous he seems. Princess Victoria of england. Prince Frederick of prussia. Well you were right Victoria. For those two children, so much can be done for the peace of the future. I shall speak to him this evening after the entertainment. May we have the next slide please? Oh mama! That is upside down. You put the slide in upside down and visa versa, then it will come out the right way up. A whimsical caprice of mother nature. Focus. You turn the little screw towards you please. Very well then, turn it away from you. Thank you. Here we have a view of the wonder of a vast age, but still remarkable. The sphinx. This curious mammal is of course notorious for it's riddle which has remained unsolved up to the present day. I shan't bother you with it now. Instead, my way of compensation I will give you a modern reverse of some ingenuity. What old bird reminds you of a musical instrument? The answer being of course. May we have the next slide please? Here we have yet another wonder of a vast age. The leaning tower of pisa. This group of people overshadowed are they not by the massive structure in the centre of the picture. Comprises my little party. This lady here is my cousin maude. We were brought up together. Next slide please. Here in contrast, we have the great wonder of modern times. I refer of course to the crystal palace. Monument indeed to the industry of the glass blower and of his royal highness. And that is the last of my slides on the wonders of the world. A room of enchantment is it not? And yet, how much more entrancing could we but people this screen with living creatures who walk and talk. Imagination boggles however. And meanwhile, I have here with me... Thank you professor for a most enjoyable and engrossing evening. Goodnight children. Father and I will come up and see you. Oh Fritz, ladies. I think you wish to see me Fritz. No your majesty. No Fritz? No your majesty. Yes Fritz you do. Sit down. Now... Your majesty, may I have your permission to ask my fathers permission, to ask your permission to ask Vicky, I mean to Princess Victoria. Yes Fritz, I understand. You have our permission. Victoria, prince Frederick has asked for your hand in marriage. I know mama. You know Vicky? Yes mama. This morning he gave me a sprig of white Heather. And by his look I knew. And do you love him? Yes I do papa. Then we have every reason to be very happy and very grateful. Mama, I hope I may do well. I have no doubts. And you shall be married in Saint James' where your dear father married me. # Merciful unto us, and bless us # # and show us the light of his countenance # # and be merciful unto us # # that thy way may be known upon earth # # thy saving health among all nations # So young, so young. I hope she will be happy. I hope so too Albert. As happy as I am. A beautiful dance. The waltz. Isn't it? Yes isn't it? How the young people do enjoy it. And the not so young? Albert, surely you can not mean that I with a married daughter-- well I have a married daughter too Victoria. Oh yes, but, I am 38 Albert. And I'm 38 too Victoria. Mr. Strauss does play this waltz truly better than anyone else. He does. Victoria, we will dance. Albert. Albert, I have news here that will do you more good than all the medicine. From President Lincoln. No. Thanking us for our dispatch on the Trent affair. Your work Albert. He goes so far as to say that it has adverted the catastrophe of war between england and america. Oh good news, very good news. It came by electric telegram. The first from america. Wonderful. The great cable aid right across the bed of the ocean. I feel better already Victoria. Surely I may be allowed to get up and sit in my chair. I don't think that would be at all wise. Oh wise, wise, you think it's wise to keep me in bed and make me begin to think that I'm really ill! Oh doctor, surely if we keep him warm he could come to no harm? Well, perhaps if his royal highness was well wrapped up. Brown, get my chair and wrap ready. Aye sir. You'll see Victoria, how quickly I feel well. Your royal highness, the prince is not so well tonight. Your playing may disturb him. But mama told me that papa would be disappointed if I did not play. It's so sad to see her sitting there hour after hour waiting for him to recognise her. Aye, well he's sick of something more than the fever. Mr. Brown, what's left? The English. They can be a cold standoffish lot if they want. Ain't he a kin that he's always been working for 'em! Have never took the to their hearts, that's what broke his. Albert. Albert! Albert! Mama! You may leave us. I will pour tea myself. You may leave us. I will pour tea myself. As sure as my name is John brown, you'll stay where you are! You're stuck in your room until I tell you you can come out of it! In the future I will not have you speak to anyone until you're spoken to first. The dresses shall be sent here so you can try 'em on there. Not out here in the gangling in the palace. What are you bobbing up and down for? Stop your bobbing up and down! Get out. Get out! What is the meaning of this brown? Well you're looking rather shabby lately. What has that to do with this person being in my private apartment? It was Maggie. Maggie? Aye, she married my brothers sisters cousin. He was a good sailor, but that's about all he was good at. Maggie's had a hard life. What has that to do with this person being in my apartment? We hear you gangling around the room like a scarecrow. Refusing to hear any new dresses for the trouble I'm hearing. Now Maggie is the dead spit of ya. I sent for her for abidene so the dresses can be fitted on her to save you the trouble. Oh I see. Yes, that was very kind of you brown. But you know very well that I do not want any new dresses. I know very well that you do. Now look at the old thing you got on now. It's all green moulded. Why should I care about clothes now that he is gone? Aye, he'd care. He took a great pride in your personal appearance, he did. He wouldn't like to see you going around like you are now. No, no I will have the fitting. No you won't. Maggie here the fitting. You'll hear the dress. Gentlemen, Mr. Gladstone is a great statesman. A very great statesman. But he has one failing, he treats the queen like a public department. I gentlemen, I treat the queen as a woman. Lord derby sir. Good morning disraeli. I have something of first class importance to tell you. You always have derby. But this is. Mr. Frederick greenwood, the editor of the pall mall gazette has just been to see me in the foreign office. He learned last night from an absolutely reliable source that the khedive of Egypt is negotiating with the French group for the sale of his shares in the Suez canal company. And you want me to buy them. You're refreshingly quick prime minister. And you're a little too quick derby. I couldn't do this without consulting our colleagues. And they would of course insist upon going to the house of commons. There's no time for that. If they move at all. We're witted to the Democratic system. It is everything we should wish our wives to be. Lovely but not fast. I thought you might have the courage of an infidelity. It would only cost four millions. I've got the courage, but not the money. Your majesty, I waited for the conclusion of this delightful dinner to report with my humble duty that romance just suddenly entered into my life. Mr. Disraeli, you alarm me. It is only a political romance ma'am. Will you just for once, just for me take your golden rule against talking business at the dinner table? Very well, you may proceed. I have had secret news the khedive of Egypt is trying to sell his shares in the Suez canal company. Suez canal. Those shares are necessary to england. He has got some wild cat scheme to buy a holding the Suez canal. He summed be about it this morning. Parliament would not of course vote the money and you could not well do anything so unconstitutional as not to go to parliament. Not well ma'am. But I've done it. You have done it? But how splendid. My dear sir, her majesty's government haven't yet sunk to speculating on a ditch in the desert. You must not talk so loud. Please tell the band to play a little louder. Now tell me all about it Mr. Disraeli. Well ma'am, on the 15th of this month I heard the share of the sale. On the 23rd I had them offered to me. The day of the 24th, the money was guaranteed by the rothschilds. The shares are ours. The Suez canal. What palmerston always called a swindle, but which I consider an artery of the British empire. Superbly described ma'am. Superbly manoeuvred Mr. Disraeli. But there's still time to get out of here sir. Would you say that again? There's still time to get out of here. And leave all these people to their doom? But they're doomed already sir. Not while I can put up the last shadow of defence. And I will, if I have to stop up every hole in the wall with my own head! And you know what a thick skull I've got. Yes. The likeness and discipline should have prompted you to disagree with me. I'm sorry sir. Have a drink and never mind. But I do mind you throwing away your own life sir. Even if I haven't one of my own. Ah, 'cause the government will never leave us in the lots. The queen will see to that. God bless her. God bless her. Your majesty, the prime minister. Mr. Gladstone, I cannot conceal from you my disquiet at the delay in your measures for the relief of general Gordon. Your majesty, everything possible is being done. No Mr. Gladstone, everything the government thinks possible. General Gordon has been besieged in Khartoum since march. Only in August has it been decided to relieve him. And only now in November has the relief force under sir garnet wolseley started out. These tardy races against time are neither to my taste nor to our credit. Believe me ma'am, I understand your anxiety. No, it is more than anxiety. It is anguish Mr. Gladstone. This great Christian soldier means something to the world. As well as to us. If we fail him, posterity will not forget. Your majesty may rest assured. I cannot rest. However much I am assured I am haunted by the dread that we may be too late. That is the danger to which this country so often exposes itself. One day it may be all our undoing. Your majesty, I have received from you this telegram. Whatever the merits of the case, I cannot think it was proper to send it to me through a public telegraph office. You are right Mr. Gladstone. I should not have sent it to you in that manner. But it expresses my feelings. My feelings ma'am are not far removed from your own. I am more distressed than I can say. We were only two days too late. Two days. What is the difference now for him between two days and two million years? He is dead. And we let him die. # Oh listen to the soldiers in the park # You may keep the change. No, you have it with me you old cock sparrow. I'm treating all me regulars today. # It is the Navy # # the British Navy # # that keeps our foes at bay # You sound very happy today. Yes Mrs. Lava, for this is a day this is. # Navy, the British Navy # # our neighbours know that's true # # for it keeps them in their place # # when they know they have to face # # the lively little lads in Navy blue # Oh wonderful day doctor. Wonderful indeed your majesty, but you must be tired out. You must rest. Yes. Did Maggie have a good view? No ma'am, she was taken ill. We had to put her to bed. She saw nothing? Nothing your majesty. Oh, oh my dear. Well Maggie. Your majesty. Now now, you must keep quiet. You must not tire yourself. The excitement was too much for me. It brought on me palpitations. So they put me to bed. Oh, what a disappointment for you. Aye ma'am. But what was it like? Well Maggie, the site at the steps of Saint Paul's with all the soldiers in their wonderful uniforms. Not only the British but the Indians. And the choir boys singing so beautiful. That must've been grand. And Maggie, there were some costermongers there and they shouted out to me. "Go it old girl." Old girl! Well. And they waved to me. The did not. Yes they did. And I waved back. You didn't! Well well, their great grandchildren will be told about that. But most wonderful of all Maggie were the crowds. Those thousands of smiling faces their cheering. Those chills will ring in my ears always. I did not know they loved me so much. She's sickened. Where is lord Salisbury? He's over there sir with his royal highness. Lord Salisbury, I feel bound to tell you that the queen is in no condition to sign these documents you've sent into her. I know that, so does she. Then shall I... You must respect her wishes. I respect them deeply your royal highness, but I should have to place drops in her eyes-- it is the queen's wish we must respect it. Very well sir, I will do my best. Thank you doctor. Her flesh is weak, but the spirit is thrilling. Yes Salisbury. It will be something to remember when ones own time comes. Box from the prime minister your majesty. I'll give you your drops. Lower your head ma'am. Well she's going. Yes, looks like it. Make way! Blimey. Never seen anything that quick. God saves the king. Sounds queer. None of us ain't ever seen that before. Except those too old to remember. Go on girl. It won't be long now. Yet how long has the magnificence has been. The great clear stretch of time that happens to be my life and I'm proud of it. Yes, it was sometimes narrow in mind, but mostly great in spirit. Spirit of achievement, change. And what changes? And what achievements? The engineers and explorers and our new saviours, scientists, surgeons. Soldiers, inventors. And even a few of our own calling on them. Yes. And what a pageant it makes, the thrill of great poetry and great prose. Thinkers who have given us a new landscape of thought. One hardly knows where to begin. One never thought of her as dying. Don't you worry, she never will. Her going seems like the end of the world. It will be the end of our world. For more than a great queen is passing into history. An era. Your royal highness immediately. Me lords, I am very young and inexperienced, but since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty to my country. God bless your majesty. It seems I have here before promised I will perform and keep so help me god.
