[ *** ] Man: OKAY, KIDS. YOU KNOW, LET'S CUT THROUGH THE SNIVELLING, SELF-SERVING, YOU KNOW, LAME, CUNT BULLSHIT, AND LET'S CUT THROUGH ALL THE FUCKING PUNK POLITICKING, HUH? OKAY, THIS IS KICKBOY FACE REPORTING FOR "SLASH" MAGAZINE. IT'S 1979, AND CLEARLY, DARBY CRASH'S BAND, "THE GERMS", HAVE EMERGED AS THE MOST UNPREDICTABLE, THE MOST CHAOTIC, AND THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD BAND IN THE WHOLE LOS ANGELES PUNK ROCK SCENE. AH, NOW, DARBY... I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, BUT LET'S START WITH THIS: EVERYBODY AROUND YOU IS NOW WEARING THESE BLUE CIRCLE ARMBANDS. NOW, WHAT IS THIS FASCINATION WITH CIRCLES? Darby: EVERYTHING WORKS IN CIRCLES. LIKE, SOMETIMES, YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING, AND... A YEAR LATER, YOU'RE BACK AT THE SAME POINT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO, CIRCLE ONE, IS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. SOMEDAY, WE'LL PROBABLY DO CIRCLE TWO. Kickboy: NOW, SOMEBODY SAID YOU'RE FASCISTS? Darby: YEAH, WE'RE FASCISTS, BUT WE'RE NOT NAZIS. AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW? LIKE, I CAN RESPECT HITLER FOR BEING A GENIUS, BUT... NOT FOR KILLING OFF ALL THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE. [ Cheers ] SOMEBODY GET ME A BEER. A BEER, GODDAMN IT! SOMEBODY GET ME A BEER. [ Angry shouts ] I MEAN, THERE'S FILMS OF HIM GIVING SPEECHES IN GERMANY, AND AMERICANS IN THE AUDIENCE, THEY WOULD START YELLING "HEIL!" EVEN THOUGH THEY COULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. HUH. [ Spit ] WHOEVER OUT THERE THINKS IT'S COOL TO SPIT BETTER BUY ME A BEER. Woman: WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR FUCKING TEETH FIXED? WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR BRAIN FIXED? [ Laughter ] Woman: FUCK YOU! ALL I WANT IS BEER, AND DAMAGE. [ Shouts ] PERSONAL DAMAGE. [ Cheers ] [ *** ] WELL, EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT POLITICS AND WHAT'S GOING TO WORK AND WHAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, BUT NONE OF IT'S GOING TO WORK. IT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO THROW IT ALL AWAY AND START OVER. [ Raspy singing ] THERE'S OTHER WAYS OF DOING IT WITHOUT OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT ALL AT ONCE. I MEAN, YOU CAN WORK FROM THE INSIDE, AND SLOWLY TAKE OVER, AND THEN THROW IT ALL AWAY. BUT, I JUST THINK IT'S STUPID TO RELATE... PERFORMING TO POLITICS. 'CAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN POLITICAL TO ME. AND THERE'S ALL THESE BANDS THAT CAME OUT AND SAID, "WE HAVE TO POLITICAL LIKE THE 'SEX PISTOLS'," AND... THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DID. [ Unintelligible singing ] WE'VE TRIED EVERY FORM OF GOVERNMENT, BUT THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL WORK IS A COMPLETE FASCIST STATE. BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD IT 'CAUSE IF EVERYONE BELIEVES IN ONE PERSON, THEN IT'LL WORK. COMMUNISM? COMMUNISM CAN NEVER WORK. Kickboy: SO WHO WOULD BE YOUR IDEAL FASCIST LEADER? ME. [ Jeers/shouts ] [ *** ] Kickboy: SO, PAT, WHAT WAS DARBY'S CHILDHOOD LIKE? Pat: YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND, HE NEVER KNEW HIS REAL DAD. AND HIS MOM HAD A LOT OF BOYFRIENDS. [ Cackling ] Pat: HE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS GUY, BOB BAKER, SAID THEY HAD FUN TOGETHER. I THINK HE HAD A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING. HIS MOM WAS LIKE A CHARACTER OUT OF A JOHN WATERS FILM. DRUNK ALL THE TIME, SCREAMED AT HIM. JUST LIKE MY MOM. [ Laugh ] Pat: HIS OLDER BROTHER DIED, TOO. HE WAS KILLED BY SOME PISSED-OFF DOPE DEALER. GAVE HIM AN INTENTIONAL OVERDOSE. HE HAD A LOT OF BAD STUFF HAPPEN TO HIM. Darby: [ Reading ] "IT IS TIME FOR MAN TO MARK HIS GOAL. IT'S TIME FOR MAN TO PLANT THE GERM..." YOU LITTLE SHIT. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? Darby: [ Reading ] "OF HIS HIGHEST HOPE..." Boy: [ Reading ] "LIFE IS A WILL TO POWER." Kickboy: SO WOULD YOU CALL HIM BRILLIANT? FRIGHTENINGLY INTELLIGENT. ABSOLUTELY. THERE WAS THIS WHOLE LITTLE GANG OF US, AND I WAS LIKE, THE HEAD PERSON. WE'D DO STUFF LIKE: CARRY AROUND "HELTER SKELTER" AND PUT "X"s ON OUR HEADS, AND THE REST OF THE SCHOOL WOULD GET REALLY SCARED, AND WANTED TO HAVE US COMMITTED. HUH. AND INSERTING THAT TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL INTO A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT WAS VERY... CHALLENGING. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE THE ONLY BLACK KID IN A WHITE SCHOOL. HUH. SO I DYED MY HAIR BLUE. AND I LOST ALL MY FRIENDS IN ONE DAY. I GUESS THERE WAS A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WERE LIKE ME THAT SAW THINGS DIFFERENTLY, BUT WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU HAVE TO EXPECT A REACTION. BUT, WE RESOLVED IT, THE BEST WAY WE KNEW HOW. [ Chortling ] GAVE HIM ALL "A"s IF HE PROMISED NEVER TO COME BACK. OF COURSE, HE HUNG OUT ANYWAY. THEN I REMEMBER, ONE DAY, HE CAME BY AND... SAID WE WERE GOING TO START A BAND, AND I WAS, LIKE, "WHAT?" [ *** ] HOW ARE WE GOING TO START A BAND IF WE DON'T EVEN HAVE INSTRUMENTS? THE SAME WAY "THE RUNAWAYS" DID. THEY JUST DID IT. ONLY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BETTER. HERE, READ MY SONGS. ASTRID? [ *** ] OH MY GOD. THESE ARE AWESOME! I HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN. FOR ME. FOR US. I MEAN, HE SAID HE HAD THIS FIVE-YEAR PLAN AND THAT... THAT AFTER THAT, IT'D BE ALL OVER WITH. BUT HE SAID CRAZY THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME. Kickboy: SO, WHAT IS THIS FIVE-YEAR PLAN? WELL, IT'S LIKE BOWIE SAID: "YOU GOT FIVE YEARS." AND THEN WHAT? YOU'LL SEE. SO WE MADE A FLYER THAT SAID "WANTED: 2 UNTALENTED GIRLS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS TO FORM A BAND." [ Chuckling ] AND THAT'S HOW WE FOUND TERRY AND BELINDA... AND BECKY. BORED GIRLS FROM THE VALLEY WHO CAME TO HOLLYWOOD TO DIRTY UP. THEN, DARBY MADE BECKY TELL HER GRANDMOTHER THAT SHE HAD LEUKEMIA. [ Giggling ] AND THAT SHE NEEDED MONEY FOR TREATMENT. WHAT AN ASSHOLE. AND THAT'S HOW WE BOUGHT ALL OF OUR INSTRUMENTS. DARBY DECIDED WE'D CALL OURSELVES "THE GERMS"... BECAUSE EVERYTHING STARTS WITH A GERM. SOMETHING ABOUT THE GERM OF AN IDEA. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE "SOPHISTIFUCK AND THE REVLON SPAM QUEENS" BUT... WE COULDN'T AFFORD THAT MANY LETTERS ON OUR T-SHIRT. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE PLAYED SO BAD, WE MADE EVERYONE SICK. [ Dopey laugh ] [ Horns honking ] Kickboy: THIS IS KICKBOY FACE, REPORTING FOR "SLASH" MAGAZINE. IT'S 1977, AND THE SUNSET STRIP NOW BELONGS TO SHITTY, BORING PIECE OF SHIT DISCO AND HORRIFYING LAME CUNT ROCK AND ROLL BANDS. I BELIEVE THE FUTURE BELONGS TO BANDS SUCH AS YOU, "THE DAMNED". CAPTAIN? I WANT TOO FUCK AS MANY OF YOUR WOMEN AS POSSIBLE. Darby: "THE GERMS!" "THE GERMS" ARE THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD! YES, YES, BUT AT A TIME WHEN LEIF FUCKING GARRETT AND DONNA FUCKING SUMMER ARE AT THE TOP OF THE MUSIC CHARTS, YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PIECE OF SHIT MUSIC TODAY, NO? FUCK, FUCK, BOLLOCKS, FUCK, SHIT. PISS OFF, WANKER. "THE GERMS" RULE! YOU SUCK. POSEURS! Kickboy: YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE PATHETIC STATE OF AMERICAN MUSIC TODAY? THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. WHAT IS THIS FUCKING "GERMS", MAN? IT'S MY BAND. HERE, CHECK IT OUT. "SEX BOY"? WE HAVE OTHER SONGS, TOO. THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR? YOU SHOULD PLAY TONIGHT AT THE ORPHEUM. ANYBODY CAN PLAY. GO, GO, COME ON! HEH... COME ON, GUYS. I THINK YOU PLUG THIS IN HERE... I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THIS THING. IT DOESN'T MATTER, 'CAUSE YOU LOOK PERFECT. Captain: HELLO, SEX BOYS. OH MY GOD, LOOK. Darby: OH FUCK... THEY'RE GOING TO ABUSE THE SHIT OUT OF US. I CAN'T DO THIS. YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT, TERRY! [ Heaving ] OH, HO, HO, HO! IS THAT A TACO? OH... OH... [ Sniffing ] [ Gagging ] UGH, GO AWAY, IT'S NOT FUNNY. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED! THIS IS WHAT I WANTED? UH-HUH. * I TAKE IT ANYWHERE * ANY TIME THAT I CAN * * I'M THE FUCKING SON OF A SUPERMAN * * I'VE GOT A WEAPON THAT'S AS DEADLY AS LIFE * GET OFF THE STAGE, YOU SILLY POOFTAHS! Man: ART FAGS! FUCK YOU! [ Off-key guitar *** ] * EVERY DAY IS THE SAME WET DREAM * * A DOZEN GIRLS ARE ON MY SCENE * * SAY, "HEY, SEX BOY" * CAN GIVE ME A HAND... Man: THAT'S NOT PUNK! YOU GUYS SUCK! [ Indistinct ] Man: GO FUCKING SUCK A COCK! WHOA. [ Laughing ] OH MY GOD. [ Laughter ] HEY! Man: FUCKING FAGGOT! LEMME GO, YOU FUCKING HOMOS! GIVE THE LIL' GIT THE BOOT! OH MY GOD, THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN! I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO PUKE BUT I DIDN'T! I DID PUKE! BUT YOU DID IT. I WANT TO PLAY AGAIN RIGHT NOW! WE WILL. [ Laughter ] HEY! THAT WAS REALLY HYSTERICAL. WHEN'S YOU GUYS' NEXT SHOW? UH, PROBABLY NEVER! [ Laughing ] OH. I'M MICHELLE. DARBY. HEY. PAT. Pat: OKAY, SO THIS WAS HIS PLAN. SAY YOU'RE A BAND, ADVERTISE, GET BAND MEMBERS, GET INSTRUMENTS, GET A REHEARSAL SPACE, PLAY A GIG, AND THEN LEARN HOW TO PLAY. IT'S A GOOD PLAN, RIGHT? [ Click ] Darby: OKAY. FORMING, TAKE ONE. GO! [ *** ] * RIP THEM DOWN, HOLD ME UP * * TELL THEM THAT I'M YOUR GUN * * PULL MY TRIGGER, I AM BIGGER THAN... * * MR. PREZ IN HIS BIG WHITE HOUSE * * LISTEN, HE SAYS, WE'RE COMING OUT * * INFILTRATION, WE'RE NUMBING YOUR MINDS * * CONCENTRATION, WE'VE DONE TIME * * RIP THEM DOWN, HOLD ME UP * * TELL THEM THAT I'M YOUR GUN * * PULL MY TRIGGER, I AM BIGGER THAN... * * OVER THERE, THE QUEEN SHE SAYS * * LET'S STAMP THEM OUT, DRY THOSE TEARS * Darby: NOW IT'S TIME TO REINVENT OURSELVES AS SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW. ARE WE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY OUR INSTRUMENTS? PAUL'S DEAD. FROM NOW ON, I'M BOBBY PYN. I DON'T GET IT. BOBBY PYN, LIKE, A BOBBY PIN. GEORGE'S NEW NAME IS PAT SMEAR. OH, YEAH. UGH, THAT'S SO GROSS! IT'S GOOD, RIGHT? YEAH. [ Dopey laugh ] Darby: TERRY, YOU HAVE THE COOLEST NAME. YOUR NEW NAME IS LORNA DOOM. OH MY GOD. THAT IS REALLY GOOD. [ Giggling ] UH, BECKY, YOU'RE DUMBHEAD. STOP! I WANT TO COME UP WITH MY OWN NAME. BELINDA, WHAT'S YOURS? I DON'T NEED A NAME. I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN THE BAND. I ACTUALLY NEVER JOINED THE BAND. UH... THE THOUGHT OF BEING ON STAGE IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE WAS WAY TOO TERRIFYING. [ *** ] * RIP THEM DOWN, HOLD ME UP * * TELL THEM THAT I'M YOUR GUN * * PULL MY TRIGGER UGH, IT'S SAND! [ Cackling ] UGH! THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT, LORNA. YEAH, IT'S PERFECT. I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE PERFECT, SO IT'S GOING TO BE PERFECT. JEEZ! * TELL THEM THAT I'M YOUR GUN * * PULL MY TRIGGER, I AM BIGGER THAN... * "LEXICON DEVIL" BY DARBY CRASH? DARBY CRASH, THAT... THAT'S HIM. HE'S DARBY CRASH. Pat: [ Reading ] "EMPTY OUT YOUR POCKETS, YOU DON'T NEED THE CHANGE. I'M GIVING YOU THE POWER TO REARRANGE. TOGETHER, WE'LL RUN TO THE HIGHEST PROP, TEAR IT DOWN, AND LET IT DROP." DARBY CRASH IS A GENIUS. [ *** ] Darby: YOU'RE PLAYING IT ALL WRONG. DRUMS ARE TOO SLOW. BASS IS TOO FAST. CHORDS ARE ALL WRONG. YOU'RE MAKING THE ENDING TOO LONG. I QUIT. [ Feedback whine ] [ *** ] [ Feedback ] FIRST OF ALL, THAT WAS SO GOOD! SECONDLY, I THINK HE JUST QUIT. Darby: I DID QUIT, FOR A WEEK. WE WEREN'T A JOKE ANYMORE [ Sigh ] [ Sigh ] AND OUR DRUMMER COULDN'T BE EITHER. Pat: SO, THE GERMS HAD A DRUMMER THING. ALWAYS A FUCKING DRUMMER THING. THE FUCKING DRUMMER THING. Pat: [ Dopey ] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, UH, A DRUMMER THING?" WITH BECKY, IT WAS JUST... [ Laugh ] OKAY, YOU KNOW... WELL, YOU KNOW HOW DARBY IS. WHAT AN ASSHOLE. [ Drumbeats ] Lorna: OUR NEXT DRUMMER WAS CLIFF HANGER WHO WAS QUIETLY DEALING OUT IN THE PARKING LOT AT THE RAINBOW. BUT HE WENT TO JAIL. I HEARD HE GOT HIS DICK CUT OFF. [ Laugh ] THEN WE GOT D.J. BONEBREAK, BUT HE WAS ALSO AN "X", AND "THE EYES" AND DARBY SAID OUR DRUMMER HAD TO BE LOYAL TO "THE GERMS". WE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NICKY BEAT, BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO IN "THE WEIRDOS". FUCKING DRUMMERS. JEEZ, CHRIS ASHFORD WAS OUR FIRST MANAGER. HE WORKED AT A RECORD STORE CALLED LIQUORICE PIZZA, AND WE WERE ALWAYS GOING IN THERE... STEALING STUFF. DARBY WOULD HAND OUT HIS LYRIC SHEETS, AND WHEN CHRIS READ THEM, WELL... HE JUST KNEW. Kickboy: KNEW WHAT? THAT HE HAD TO BE A PART OF IT. OH SHIT. OH! Pat: CHRIS TOOK THE TAPE, AND GOT A SINGLE PRESSED. THE FIRST PUNK-ROCK SINGLE IN L.A. HISTORY. HE PUT THE LABEL ON THE WRONG SIDE AND WE GAVE HIM A TONNE OF SHIT. WATCH OUT, CHRIS! [ Laughter ] Pat: BUT HE STUCK BY US. [ *** ] CHRIS TOOK US TO THE MASQUE, A STORAGE SPACE UNDER A PORNO THEATRE ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. SOME GUY NAMED BRENDAN MULLEN CLEARED IT OUT AND STARTED CHARGING PEOPLE TO REHEARSE THERE AND IT JUST SORT OF TURNED INTO A CLUB SOMEHOW. [ Glass shattering ] OH MAN! DO YOU GUYS HAVE TO DESTROY EVERYTHING? Darby: YEAH. [ Glass shattering ] [ Yelps/Laughter ] OH! YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ON THIS GUY'S BAD SIDE. YEAH, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT "FLEETWOOD MAC", OKAY? AND YOU'RE NOT "THE BEE GEES". YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET GIGS JUST ANYWHERE. EXCEPT MAYBE HERE. YEAH, AND THEN YOU WOKE UP. [ Laughter ] UGH. I'M GOING TO TALK TO BRENDAN. OH, AND DARBY? TRY NOT TO GET INTO ANY TROUBLE, OKAY? SURE THING, DAD. Man: "SCREAMERS!" Man: "SCREAMERS" RULE! [ Shouts ] WE STOLE THIS SONG FROM "THE GERMS" BECAUSE WE LIKE IT AND BECAUSE WE DO IT BETTER THAN THEM. IT'S CALLED "SEX BOY". [ *** ] IT'S "SEX BOY"! [ Mixed shouts ] [ *** ] * I CAN TAKE IT ANYWHERE * * ANY TIME THAT I CAN * I'M THE FUCKING SON OF A SUPERMAN * [ *** ] * I GOT A WEAPON THAT'S AS DEADLY AS LIFE * * IT'S A WELL-TRAINED TOOL OF A MASTER GUY * PERSONALLY, I LIKE OUR VERSION BETTER. * EVERY DAY, IT'S THE SAME REGIME * * 20 GIRLS ARE ON MY SCENE * DON BOLLES. I'M YOUR NEW DRUMMER. I DON'T BOOK BANDS AT THE MASQUE. IT'S NOT A CLUB. IT'S A COOPERATIVE ART ENVIRONMENT FOR ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSION. M-A-S-Q-U-E. THAT'S HOW YOU SPELL IT. AS IN POE'S "MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH"? EVEN THOUGH, OF COURSE, PUNK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POE. Pat: NOBODY EVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE GUY SAID. WE ALWAYS SAID HE SHOULD HAVE, LIKE, WORDS UNDERNEATH HIM LIKE IN ONE OF THOSE FOREIGN FILMS. RIGHT... RIGHT, SO ANYWAY, BRENDAN... THIS IS EITHER THE BEST OR THE WORST THING THAT I'VE EVER HEARD. BUT I HAD TO PACK UP THE CAR AND DRIVE RIGHT OUT TO BE IN THE BAND. DRIVE OUT? FROM ARIZONA. YOU DROVE OUT ALL THE WAY FROM ARIZONA? THAT'S WEIRD. HUH. WELL, I COULD TELL YOU GUYS LIKE THE SAME STUFF I LIKE. I MEAN, KRAUTROCK. AVANT-NOISE. OH, LIKE THAT'S REAL MUSIC. [ Laughter ] WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW, DON'T ASK ME. PRETTY DAMN BRILLIANT, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. I MEAN, HE DID DRIVE OUT FROM ARIZONA. AND THAT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING. OKAY, DON. YOU'RE A GERM. OUTSTANDING! NOW CUT YOUR HAIR, YOU KRAUTROCK HIPPIE. [ Laughter ] "THE GERMS". HEY, BRENDAN, BECAUSE OF THAT SHOW AT THE ORPHEUM, THEY'RE GETTING A REPUTATION. MAN, YOU COULD EVEN CHARGE PEOPLE A COUPLE BUCKS TO WATCH THEM PLAY. MAN, THE LEAD SINGER, HE'S BRILLIANT. HE'S LIKE A JIM MORRISON BUT FOR OUR GENERATION. OH MY GOD, YOU GUYS. THERE'S TWO PEOPLE FUCKING OVER THERE. Belinda: EW, GROSS. WHERE? RIGHT THERE. Belinda: UGH. [ Giggle ] Woman: [ Yelling ] [ Laughing ] WAIT, THEY'RE OVER THERE! Lorna: [ Sniff ] IT KIND OF SMELLS LIKE BUTTER. I'M DARBY CRASH. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. MUFFINS. Darby: LET'S FUCK UP THESE ART FAGS. THEY RUINED MY SONG. YEAH. YEAH, LET'S DO THAT. NOT A SCRATCH, MAN. PROMISE. Men: [ Howling ] [ Clatter ] HEY, DON'T TOUCH ME, YOU FUCKING JERK! HEY, LEAVE HIM ALONE! HE'S JUST HAVING FUN. [ Groaning ] OW... [ Door slams ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] THAT WAS AWESOME, DUDE. YEAH. WOW. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? I FUCKING NABBED IT OFF THE BACK OF SOME POSEUR. IT'S FOR YOU. I... I'M ROB. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. [ *** ] Darby: "SLASH" WOULDN'T PRINT OUR AD. IT SAID, "SIX MILLION JEWS CAN'T BE WRONG." AND THERE WAS NO PICTURE, JUST A CIRCLE. Darby's voice: OUR FAMILY IS A CIRCLE. AND IT WILL BE, FOREVER. Kickboy: SO IT WAS AN ANTI-HITLER THING? NO. IT CAN BE TAKEN EITHER WAY. I'VE TALKED TO JEWISH PEOPLE WHO WOULD GET REALLY UPSET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IT MEANS. Darby's voice: AND IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN OUR CIRCLE... BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHOLE NAZI THING, ANYWAY. ...THEN YOU ARE INSIDE THE CIRCLE. WE'RE NOT DOING IT ON THAT BIG OF A SCALE. JUST, LIKE IN OUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. Kickboy: WELL, IT'S EASY TO BE AN ARTISTIC FASCIST. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO COMMIT TO A CERTAIN THING AND THEN YOU... NO. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. I HAVE A VERY, VERY SET IDEA OF WHAT I WANT TO GET DONE AND HOW I'M GOING TO DO IT, AND I NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP ME DO IT. Kickboy: H-HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THOSE FUCKING PEOPLE? THEY'LL SHOW UP. [ Sniff ] THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEFORE. Darby's voice: FOR SOME REASON, IF YOU FIND YOURSELF OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE... [ Sigh ] THEN YOU'RE OUT FOR GOOD... BUT YOU, LORNA... ARE THE MOST INSIDE. [ Sizzling ] OW! WHAT THE FUCK? IT'S A GERMS' BURN. A CIRCLE. OW! STINGS, HUH? OW, THAT STINGS REALLY FUCKING BAD. LISTEN, SOMEDAY, WHEN YOU'RE OLD, LIKE... 40, YOU'LL BE PAYING FOR GROCERIES AT A GROCERY STORE AND YOU'LL SEE SOMEBODY THAT HAS ONE AND YOU'LL KNOW. KNOW WHAT? THAT THEY WERE A PART OF IT TOO.

WELL, THE BANDS THAT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO HATE LIKE... "THE WHO" AND THE STONES AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT, I MEAN, THEY WENT OUT AND THEY LIVED ON THE STREETS, AND DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO MAKE IT. BUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE AT THE CANTERBURY, THEY WORK AT FIORUCCI'S BECAUSE... THEY KNOW THEY MIGHT NOT MAKE IT AS A BAND. NONE OF THEM ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE 35 AND HAVE DONE NOTHING. NONE OF US WORK BECAUSE IF WE DON'T MAKE IT AT THIS... WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT AT ANYTHING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY MONEY TO PAY OUR RENT. * I'M A LONER WITH BALONER I'M GONNA HAVE TO PHONE HER * [ Guitar *** ] * I'M A LONER WITH MALONER I'M GONNA HAVE TO BONE 'ER * [ Mixed chatter ] HITLER USED TO HAVE HIS ARCHITECTS MAKE TWO MODELS OF THE SAME BUILDING.

RECORD COMPANIES DON'T WANT US. THEY WANT DISCO. THEN WE'LL MAKE IT OURSELVES. AND WE'LL HAVE "SLASH MAGAZINE" PUT UP THE MONEY FOR IT. DID BIGGS SAY HE'D DO IT? HE WILL. "THE GERMS" HAVE DECIDED TO DO THEIR ALBUM ON SLASH RECORDS. SLASH RECORDS? Darby: YEAH. [ Chuckling ] SLASH RECORDS DOESN'T EVEN EXIST. WE WANT BOWIE TO PRODUCE. THAT IS A FUCKING GREAT IDEA! OR MARK LINDSAY. MARK LINDSAY? FROM "PAUL REVERE AND THE RAIDERS"? [ Chuckling ] THAT GUY MAKES MORE MONEY IN AN HOUR THAN I'LL SEE IN A LIFETIME. WHY DON'T WE JUST PRODUCE IT OURSELVES, YOU GUYS? SHUT UP, CACTUS HEAD. [ Chuckling ] [ Whispering ] HEY, WHAT ABOUT ROY THOMAS BAKER? Darby: OKAY, WE WANT EITHER BOWIE, LINDSAY, OR ROY THOMAS BAKER OR WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. LOOK. I'M, LIKE, A HUGE "GERMS" FAN, ALL RIGHT? SO I'M JUST GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. YEAH, I'M THINKING OF STARTING A RECORD LABEL. BUT IF I DO, I'D DO AN ALBUM WITH "X". WHY "X"?

[ *** ] Darby: [ Reading ] "I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE EXCEPT IN PERISHING FOR THEY ARE THOSE THAT GO BEYOND. I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE GREAT ADORERS. THEY ARE ARROWS LONGING FOR THE OTHER SHORE. I LOVE THOSE WHO DO NOT SEEK BEYOND THE STARS FOR A REASON TO PERISH AND BE SACRIFICED, BUT WHO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES TO EARTH IN ORDER THAT EARTH MAY SOMEDAY BECOME SUPERMAN'S. TELL ME, MY BRETHREN, IF THE GOAL BE LACKING TO HUMANITY, IS NOT HUMANITY ITSELF LACKING? IT IS TIME FOR MAN TO MARK HIS GOAL. IT IS TIME FOR MAN TO PLANT THE GERM OF HIS HIGHEST HOPE."

I WAS TELLING THESE PEOPLE HERE, I FEEL LIKE THE '80s HAVE BEGUN. News Anchor: IT WAS AT THE DAKOTA THAT THE LENNONS DECIDED TO BREAK THEIR SILENCE AND RECORD THEIR NEW ALBUM, "DOUBLE FANTASY". THE FANTASY, AND THE PEACE, ENDED VIOLENTLY AT THE DAKO... Pat: [ Reciting ] "ASTRID WAS FROM A PLANET BLUE. HE SPOKE OF LOVE FOR ME AND YOU. HE COULD SET YOUR MIND ABLAZE WITH SPARKLING EYES AND VISIONARY GAZE. HE STOOD LIKE A REMNANT FROM OUTBREAK PAST, WORE SOMETHING IN HIS EAR AND BOY, HE WAS SASS. HAD HAIR LIKE A ROCKET'S NEST, BUT WHEN HE CHEERED, HE GAVE HIS BEST. HE MADE A NOISE THAT STIRRED OUR SOULS, GOT US MOVING OUT OF CONTROL. WHEN ASTRID MOVED, WE CHANGED OUR TUNES. THEY FILLED HIS ARMS WITH NEEDLES BARE, SHOT HIM UP AND CUT HIS HAIR, TIED HIM TO AN EVIL PLOT, TOLD THE KIDS THAT HE WAS NOT THEIR MAN. HE GAVE US LIFE AND DEALT US LOVE, SOLD US OUT FOR THE GREAT ABOVE. ON A STARRY NIGHT IN MID-DECEMBER, ASTRID DIED. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER. LIVE IT TO THE END. SHARE IT WITH A FRIEND. DENY ME NOT. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN YOUR THOUGHTS... BEYOND." Darby: EVERYTHING WORKS IN CIRCLES, LIKE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING, AND, A YEAR LATER, YOU'RE BACK AT THE SAME POINT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO CIRCLE ONE IS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. SOMEDAY WE'LL PROBABLY DO CIRCLE TWO.
