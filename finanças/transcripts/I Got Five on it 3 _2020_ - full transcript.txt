You know I got honeys lining up for me anyways. Right. What do you want fool? Have you seen my Maxim? No. How about that old Playboy you had lying around? Nah man, I threw that out like two weeks ago. The pages got sticky. Why, what are you trying to do with it? You know that chick I had over here last night? Yeah bro, she looked cool. She cut out after using the bathroom. Hey, you ain't blaming me, right? I went straight to my room. I didn't cock block. Nah, it wasn't you. It's just like, I don't understand. She was all over me. She had me hard as a villain, then she excused herself, used the restroom. You know, I thought she was gonna like, freshen up or something. But then she cut out on me and left me with this raging case of blue balls. What? Bitch didn't even say bye, dude. That's cold-blooded, fool. But that's the one thing a girl won't put up with. A dirty toilet. Bro, you're the one that pisses all over the place. Hey, I can't help it if I piss sideways in the morning. It's the boner, it's not my fault. It's your crooked dick, bro. Didn't your parents teach you to piss on the Cheerio? Piss on the Cheerio, what the fuck is that? Yeah, piss on the Cheerio. That's how parents potty train little boys. They put a Cheerio in there, and they tell the boys to aim, make it into a little game. And that's how you learned? No man, they were always at work. My sister raised me. And they were always too lazy to show me how to do it right, so I just learned how to piss sitting down, the way they did. Damn bro, you better keep that shit to yourself. TMI for real.

But he sure looks like he's ready to take some confessions. He looks official. You're right, though. This motherfucker probably only became a priest to listen to these bitches' dirty confessions. That's what I would do. Well, what do you want to get in to, man? I don't know, cuddy. I'm almost out of OG. I probably only got enough for like one more. Wanna hit up the homies for a sack?

My twin brother only served three years. I got 10. I was a cop. They wanted to make an example. 10 long years. But I'm almost done. Been in this pre-release unit for, I don't know, a week? Any moment now, I get my life back. How about you? Those whackas gave me seven bloody years in this hell hole. All I could wish for was the destruction of Barney Bumble and his ghetto crew. I won't have my life back until I've destroyed his. You ain't gotta tell me. I'd kill every single one of those motherfuckers, if I'd get my hands on 'em. I don't know about the Barney fella, but because of his friends, I lost my job, got sent to prison, and all the money me and my brother ever made was gone just like that. I was smart about that. I put my assets in my family's name overseas. I used what I could in here to make friends. The only friend I had was my brother. Where's your brother now? Eh, he moved back east. East Oakland? No, East Coast. Couldn't stand California anymore. Poor bastard had to toss a few salads to survive in here, ah. We've all had to do some undesirable things in this place. So, what about you? How did a ex-cop survive in here? Are you kidding me? They put me in protective custody as soon as I touched down Lucky Bobby. Bobby? I forget how misinformed you Yanks are. Bobby is, what do you that call in your, hood? Po Po, Police, yes. I don't know about that. I might have been a PC but I had to grow eyes in the back of my head. seemed like every single inmate had it out for me. But I've been lucky, I guess. If you want to call it luck being locked up 23 hours a day in a single cell. Shit! So How could your brother feel now about those white guys that locked him up? Is he still is livid as you are? I don't think so. He moved on. He started a family. I barely hear from him anymore. Every once in a while he puts money on my books for my birthday. I miss him. Well, let me tell you something, Evans. I'm in the P.C unit as well, awaiting release. I have a friend outside who was released a few months back. I set him up. We have a place to stay and a car. And first thing I'm doing is the undoing of the Bumble and his ghetto friend. Will you join me? Hell fucking yes I'll join you. Pip pip and all the good stuff. Chap, chapity chap, chap! Right on. What are you doing? Cruisin' cousin. Yeah, but why are you bobbing your head? There's no music on. The music is in my head, Yadadamean? That's fucking crazy man. You don't hear it bro? This shit slammin'. I wanna put some real music on 'cause people are gonna think we're weird, man. Turtle! Oh shit. Relax bro, I come in peace. I'm bearing gifts. Proceed. I know I only owe you two bucks but I figured $50 should cover the interest and we could be good. Oh, is that what you thought? Man that's 11 years, that's 50 bucks, take it? Truce? Fuck it. Truce. Yeah, awesome. Can't wait. I've been wanting to come here so long. Heard you guys got the fattest stacks and best weed in Cali. That is true. All right man, what can we do for you? I don't know, what do you recommend? How much you got? I got two stacks right now. Two stacks. All right, well, we're gonna start him with some Einstein. 'cause that shit is lit. True. Then we're gonna move on to the blueberry adits, nice. Don't forget about the blueberry. Why is it called blueberry? A few years back some brothers buried some bud, next to a blueberry bush. So now that shit comes up smelling and tasting like blueberry. So good. For real? Yeah. But but, last but not least, you gotta get the Bumble broccoli. That's the shit that put us on the map. Best weed ever. I heard of that shit bro, whatever happened to Bumble, I heard he's a legend around these places. Yeah, he's still our partner but we run the shop. Well, he's got other things on his plate. He found a higher calling. Oh shit. He's a fucking priest? Well, at least that's what he says he is. The Bay Area's high society is now working for a higher authority. That's legit. Yeah. You know what, I just thought of something. Being that it's his first time here. I think we should hook him up with a free edible, on the house. Go get the weed, I'll get your edible for you buddy. Thanks, I appreciate it, bruh. Not a problem. All right, let's see. I'ma hook you up man. That's awesome, appreciate it. Here you go, man. All right man. Hey, don't be smoking this shit all in all one day, okay. It might get you sick.

When I was first locked up when I was 18, the inmates said I looked 12. First names Tommy, hence Tommy Boy. Wow, that must have been hard on you. It was pretty rough, till I learned to defend myself. How so? I made shanks out of anything I could find. Dirty razors. I didn't give a fuck, throwaways. Cut a few dicks off literally. They learned after that. Enough with the formalities, Tommy. What do you have on Bumble? Not gonna believe this one, Larry. Well, let's have it. Word has it he's in seminary school. What the hell is seminary school? It's where one goes to become a priest. You've got to be kidding. Barney Bumble the priest? Not kidding you, Larry. Word has he has a dispensary opened up with a couple guys from his crew, the black guy and the big fellow. And I guess Barney joined the priesthood and called it his calling. Well, is the shop still open? Yes, its one of Oakland's most finest. Well holy shit! No pun intended. I'm gobsmacked.

Ebonics! I speak the Queens english! I speak the Queen of English too, Queens, New York. The first thing we should do is search for Barney Bumble. Is Google still in vogue? Google's still a thing, yeah. There he is with his stupid umbrella. Go ahead and click it. I wanna see what he looks like. The shit kids listen to nowadays. I kinda like it. ♪ It's that pimp, mack, ♪ hustla from the O ♪ Wait a minute. ♪ I ain't fuckin' with blow ♪ I know that Mexican asshole right there. ♪ All the bitches love to taste my sack ♪ And that bitch that got me busted giving me head. ♪ And a fat-ass Expi on top o' dat ♪ Bitch got me fucking sex charges.

What are the particulars on the shop? What do you mean, like where it's at and shit? Yes. Bro, I told you its like few blocks away on 73rd. What about the telly? Let me ask Google. You're gonna call them? No, Tommy Boy's gonna call them, they might recognize our voices. Hey Google, what's number for Bombalicious? Bombalicious can be contacted at 510-555-6969. What do you want me to say? Shh! Let me think. I'm thinking. Man that "out too munch" sign is genius bro. I know man. Whenever we need take a smoke break we just put that sign out there. Let's get to the point. This new job the old folks home thing, what do you do? You mean your lazy ass really got a job? That's what I'm saying? Yeah. Wait. You two bastards think I can't get a job? It's not that you can't get a job, you keep getting jobs but you just keep getting fired from all jobs. Man you confusing me with my cousin bro. Okay, wait a minute, what about that job you had at Rasputins? Got caught stealing CDs. I didn't steal shit, I told you guys. Look the Darkroom Familia guys were over there signing the autographs and shit. Dude gave me an autographed CD. Fucking manager guy stole that shit. What about the time that you somehow got a job at a daycare and some kid almost died? What fucking kid doesn't like PB&J? How the fuck would I know the little bitch had a peanut allergy? She had a medical bracelet on, man. Thought it was jewelry. It was one of those EPI pen thingies. And then he still couldn't do shit. Some kid from the class had to save her and give her a shot. I'm afraid of needles. Look, I don't care. What do you do there? All right. I don't want you guys giving me any shit for it either. I'm in charge of retrieving and washing the soiled beddings. That's it. So you're saying we don't have to give you shit anymore 'cause you keep getting it from these seniors. But I'm getting 30 bucks an hour for that shit. Okay, whatever that you getting from that, but let me ask you a question. What's the worst shit you've seen of all? Do I want to hear this? I don't know if I do. That's easy. Last week, this 90 nine year old lady shat herself everywhere. So they called me to go retrieve her beddings and so when I get there, the nurse already pulled her to the side and was holding her, she'd just took off her diaper. So all you can see is this dripping, sagging, wrinkled, white ass smothered in shit. As I was pulling her shit-wet sheets from underneath her, the fucking crow goes at it and again. Look like fucking purple prune juice coming out of there. So I panicked and I just bunched up the sheets to try to shut her asshole, but that shit didn't work. It just came out the side and top of the sheet. Please tell me that you had gloves The little latex thing? Anything? Something? It goes up to my elbows and that shit. Its disgusting dude. Fucking nasty. Yeah but I got overtime for that. Man I don't think that $3000 is worth that. Ain't the only time it happened. You know somethin' man, you messed me up so bad right now. I think I'm constipating again. My crap just called up my ass. The phone's ringing, c'mon. Bombalicious. Mind, body and soul. Soul! Hello. Hey, how's it going brother? My name is Rocky Robbins. I'm a reporter from "High Times" Magazine. Is the owner available? Hey man, It's a reporter's from the "High Times" Magazine. What? I'm one of the owners. I'm Jim with two Ms. Well, Jimmy, I want to do an exclusive on the shop. If the editor likes what he sees, maybe even a cover story. I understand you're very popular in the Bay Area. Oh, that's right, we Oaktown's finest. Its what I hear. Would it be possible to do an interview with your partners sometime tomorrow? Yeah, they wanna interview me and my partners. Yeah, but it's just us though. Barney is not even here. Hey, look well, tomorrow's fine, but just it's gonna be you know, it's only me and Oscar. Barney is not here. Oh, is that Mr. Bumble? Yeah, yeah. He's at a seminary school somewhere in Sacramento, you know. I understand. And that will be fine if it's just two. I'm sure you can fill me in and about Mr. Bumble. Oh yeah. Oh, I'd like to take some pictures as well. That'd be fine. Okay, sir try for 12. I'll phone you when I get in, if that's all right, yeah? Yeah man. That's good. That's good. Thank you. Oh, no sir. Thank you. Huh? How did I do? Brilliant my man, brilliant. Oh I have a plan. But first we must drive to Sacramento to make sure our green umbrella fella is becoming a priest. Hey, welcome to Bombalicious. Come on in, man. What can I get for you? What's up brother? Don't ask me I can't sign? Oh shit. Don't worry guys, I got this guys. I knew a mute in high school. Sorry, we're out of weed. How can I help you bro? Thank you, brother. Glad you know sign. I want bumble sack of cookies. He wants a bumble sack of cookies. What are you waiting for? Get him some weed man. Okay, okay. Hey, tell him it's on the house and that were sorry for the wait. It's on the house, sorry for the wait. Thank you. What the fuck did I just watch? Why are you talking like that? Hey man, what's up with you with that guy? What did I do? I just signed with the guy. No man, you was sounding like Marlee Matlin. I don't know and who the fuck is Marlee Matlin? It's the deaf actress who signs and talks like that. What the fuck are you talking about? That's how all the mutes talk. It's not mute asshole, it's deaf. All right deaf. What the fuck dude. I helped you guys out and you guys talk shit? It took everything I had not to crack up before that guy. Yeah, me too man. Yeah man it sound like you were making fun of that guy. Well, I can't help it. I met some guy in high school and I can't help it if I talk like that when I sign language. That's how I talk, when I sign. You're a dick. That's some fucking shit. Yeah, it's some real fucked up shit. You're such a dip shit bro. Get your ass off me. Hey guys, about one block away. I told you we'd be here before six. This baby's accurate to the minute and miles. Technology today is absolutely amazing. We didn't even have the I-cellphone when I got locked up. It's iPhone bro, just iPhone. Whatever, dude. There it is guys. All Saints Seminar. How are you gonna find him, Larry? Are you just gonna walk in and ask? No, Evans. I had Tommy Boy here call while he was scrubbing your ass and inquire about Bumble. Yeah, apparently he's going in some Narcotics Anonymous class every weeknight at six. Poor bastard's having trouble kicking the weed. Yet he still owns a pot shop. the irony. Yeah, well business is business. That is correct. So if Tommy got the word from the street, his own partners tell you, why do you still insist on seeing this prick as a priest? I have to see things with my own eyes. Even though I despise Bubble and his crew. I must respect the man's higher calling. With all the sinning I've done in my life, I hope the Lord has a small place for me through those pearly gates and I can't ruin that by killing a man of God. Damn bro. That's some deep shit! Maybe you wanna turn over a new leaf? Don't get it, what do they say, twisted, Tommy Boy. I may not hurt him physically. But if I can hurt him financially, then I'll have it all, will have it all. Well its 10 to six. Look there's someone now. No, it can't be, is it? If hadn't seen it with my own peepers. Well, we still have his asshole friends. That's where I wanna get back at. Yeah, I'm afraid Bumble gets a pass for now. But those friends, those wankers do not. I know what that face means, you have a plan right? If you want to hurt someone, you hurt them where it hurts the hardest. And where does it hurt the hardest? In their wallet. So tomorrow we shall have our payback! What do you wanna do now? We need some supplies. What kind of supplies? Surplus, tactical, costume. Do you know any? I know of one. There's one in Marina, one in Berkeley or some shit, Party Haven? Excellent. Off you go, my good man. Now, listen up. Hey bro, hang this up for us. Its barely six o'clock, you guys closing already? Yeah, we always close this time man. Why? Because the freaks definitely do come out at night. Yeah man, all them types and bad apples they come on at night man so we closed right at sunset. You guys don't lose business that way? I don't think so. We open up shop at seven a.m. for the wake and bake crowd and by four o'clock everyone already has their weed because they wanna smoke on 4:20, yada? Makes sense. Besides man, most robberies happen at night and I sure in the hell don't wanna get robbed by no ratchet ass Oaktown niggas at night. True. Are you coming with us or what? No, man that was Mario. He needs a ride. Are you tellin' me that nigga still aint got no car or nothing like that? Nah bro. He barely makes rent as it is. so he don't have any kind of job at all. Nah bro. Not after that a crop dusting thing. He says his job is pimping hoes and using bitches like ATM. Man, he don't want him getting the clap or the herps or something like that. He got the clamps last year after fucking with some bitch. And then check this out after using all the antibiotics, you know, to cure his little thing, he went right back to this bitch because she worked at Krispy Kreme's and always bought him donuts. Dude, that's fucking disgusting. What the fuck are the clams? Chlamydia, bro. He had, green goo dripping out of his pee pee. Okay, that's enough. I've had enough. You've been say some nasty shit all day, bro. A lot of nasty shit bro. Just hang the sign and leave. Yeah, really gone bro. Hey, just hang the sign and go. Yeah, got go. All right, guys. Catch up with you guys later. All right. That's your friend. No man, that's your friend man. Its your fucking friend, you're the one who introduced me to him When? You slept with his sister. I didn't know him then, you slept with his Mom. Yeah then I gotta be his friend. You gotta be as fuck. Look you have to be his friend or I can't be yours. That's true, fuck! Did I wear you out? I think you broke my dick. Is that all? My back too. Damn. Can you get that for me? It's on your side. Okay, one, two, three. Stop it. Mario, I've seen all of you today. Inside, outside, everywhere. Shh! Its my cousin. Whats up cuz? What up boy, you ready? Yeah cuddy. Let me just put my shirt on real quick. All right, man but hurry up. I wanna get home before "The Bachelor" starts. It's the season finale. Just give me like, five minutes. Damn boy, you're all right? Sound beat up or something. Yeah, cuddy, I'll be right out.

Being a bachelor isn't all it's cracked up to be. Back to my self. I'm back. What a bloody, long day! Tell me about it. This morning we were eating grits and runny eggs with assholes in orange jumpsuits. And now we're planning a robbery? It's funny how life works, isn't it? Please tell me we're not gonna end up back in orange. Got a point, you sure about this, Larry? I'm willing to bet my freedom on it's a brilliant plan. First we pull up in the sedan, lights flashing. Three federal agents step out, one, two, three, fully covered in FBI gear. We hank up those bastards to the floor. When they're unable to move, we'll rob them of every ounce of Mary Jane. Disappear without an issue, and vanish without a trace. And we'll have enough merchandise to start our own operation. All on those wankers' dime. But weed's legal in California now, why would they think it's a real raid? That's true its legal in California, but according to the federal government, it's illegal. They serve federal seizures all the time, for tax issues or the selling of illegal narcotics. That's why it's a federal seizure. With the FBI serving it, it makes it legit, right? You're right. But how much stuff do you think we can leave with? All of it? They must have over 80 to $100,000 worth of sweet Mary Jane. Yeah, I could believe that. It's reasonable, maybe even more. I heard all they have is quality shit. I like the sound of that. I also like the tactical gear. Right in our faces. Good plan. It's fool proof. I hope you're right, brother. I hope you're right. Hold on, don't look at these. Poppins, you are without a doubt a pure genius. You're gonna have to work on your American accent. Oh, you don't have to worry about that, buddy. I watched enough American television to get that done. Freeze motherfucker! Excellent. Legit man, straight legit. Love it, love it. About time. 20 minutes. What happened to five? I'm sorry, cuz. Don't serve with that fucking shotgun cuddy. Shit, It got dark, this is Oakland. Bro you know I'm on probation. Put that chopper on the trunk before we get pulled over or somethin'. All right but when I get back you gonna tell me what happened, all right? Go bro, just go. I aint going nowhere until you tell me what happened. Fuck "The Bachelor". So what happened? Look bro, I'm sorry it took so long okay? Nah man, that's not what I mean bro. What happened with the chick, bro? She aint like you You look like you were in the battle royal boy. I feel like I was too, cuddy. For real. The fuck, what happened? Did you hit it or not? Did you? Yeah. Was it good? Everything you expected? Was it bomb bro? Tell me the truth. I don't know, I haven't decided yet. What the fuck does that mean? The girl clearly worked you out. Its complicated. Complicated? Bro, this morning you were all excited. You were finally going to get some pussy. What happened? I've never seen anybody so upset they got laid. She had a dick or somethin'? She had a dick? Just go bro. "The Bachelor" is on, fuck. All right dude. She had a dick. Yeah. Lets go. We're late. Come on! What are you doing? Give me a minute, bro. What were you doing in there, man? Man, I told you man, I had to take a shit man.

Oh, yeah, but can we just stop and get somethin' to eat? Like some donuts or something? That was bad for you. Look, you see this protein bar, eat that. No bro, what about some apple fritters or something like that man? No man, Listen, that protein bar is gonna keep you full until lunch and give you all the protein you need. That's what you want in your body right now. No man, this shit taste like cardboard man. It tastes good. Just eat it and you'll be fine. Why you want always sound like a fucking commercial when you telling me something, man? Is it all you do, to watch commercials? I know what I'm talking about? Damn. And it gets to us.
