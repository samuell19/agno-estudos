Through leaves of apathy... ...I spy the fierce bark of my generation. A wretched blob of ups and downs. Chasing phantoms in fancy suits. The tree grows limp. Cloudy skies cluster overhead. Seriously? I know. Hey! Where’s Niz? Could you get him please? Niz? Yeah, just one second. Figs! How’s it hanging brother? Precariously. Thanks! Oh Jay, meet Figs. Figs, Jay. Hello Figs. Interesting name. Yeah. It’s short for Figaro. Like the opera? Yes... Mozart. My parents. They’re lovers of the opera. Ok then... That’s new. Thank you. Awesome stuff! It's your stuff! Oh yes! Correct. Niz! What the... Where have you been? I’ve been waiting, like forever! I am a traveler, lost in a storm. All I want to do is to love you. You are my light, my inspiration. You are my love, my reason to live. Maggie, I love you! Wow! What awful poetry! Figs... A photographer and a poet! Fantastic. Good catch, Maggie. Figs. How's it going? Yeah... well... ...pillaging, licentiousness and drunken debauchery. You know, the usual. And you, sir? Just chilling. So... We’ll be back! Oh and Figs... Take it easy on the drinks 'yo'! Ok 'yo'... - See you. - Bye. Mishra! Tell me something… Just roll another joint. Yes, indeed! - Maggie. - Hey! - Happy Birthday! - Thank you. You don’t smoke? No. Is that a problem? Yes, yes, yes... No, no, no... Why do guys always do that? Do what? You know? Have a smoke after... How many guys have you known? So, why are you sitting here? Excuse me? If you’ve got something to say... ...just say it. Apologies. What’s your deal? Excuse me? You heard me. What’s your deal? Figs, you don’t know Jay? Jayshri Bose! President, LSR Debsoc. Debate! How cool! Wow... Why don't you give us a rundown of that debate speech? So Figaro, what’s your deal? Mine? I am just in love with hash. Yeah! Why so serious, Mr.? Nothing. I was just thinking... I might have to leave town for a few days. I’m going to head to the hills. Why? What happened? Some work. Photography work. Cool. So take me with you! No! It’s work. No! It’s work... Come on! Don’t be silly. Hey! What are you doing? You’ll break it, baby! Stop it. Of course not. I know how to use this. No. Stop. Don’t do that. Come on. Smile. I said stop! Come on... Niz! Don’t make me use force! Force is good. So Jay, how’s everything in college? Great. In fact I’m working on a new assignment. We’re doing a case study on political refugees. Niz and I, we have this old school friend, Thupten. He has become quite the spokesman for a free Tibet. Nice. It’s a cause worth fighting for. Listen to this bull shit! Wow... Guess everyone’s entitled to an opinion... Even the drunk village idiot! Who do you think you are? Che Guevara? No, you’re not! Not even close. You’re just a silly, delusional, bourgeois girl with a stick up her ass. Who do you think you are? You’re just a self-involved, vacuous... ...Freak. What pretentious use of English! Listen. What’s your name? - Jay, right? Jay? - Yeah. Listen, Jay. I know the world’s a fucked up place but I’m also smart enough to know... ...that there’s nothing that you or I... ...sitting here in this beautiful posh farm house... ...can do about it. So I’m just going to sit here and smoke this doobie... ...while the world can go fuck itself. You’re an ass hole. Yeah... I am! Drop the yuppie act, will you? Get real. Here she is folks! Revolutionary Bose to the rescue. Fighting evil and doing good. How cute. You’re right. It is cute. What? Jay? Jay? Figs! Figs! Are you ok, brother? It’s all good. It’s all good. Everyone’s a critic. Figs? Figs? Figs Bhardwaj... the things you do. Good morning! Auto! "Light and shadow are now in harmony." "The news spreads in every direction." "Commotion in these winds as well." "Light and shadow are now together." "The commotion of the world tells you." "Be intoxicated with your wishes." "Content in their thoughts." "The woes behind these smiles." "That bird..." "...which desires only smoke..." "That bird which desires only smoke." "A great deal of time has passed by." "What is right and what is wrong." "There exists no limit, yet." "Look they’re really exhausted." "Your heart tells you to dance carefree." "Let’s sail the ship of smoke." "Where no one ever travels to, let’s go there." "That bird which desires only smoke." "That bird..." "...which desires only smoke..." Thank you. I bought them fresh from the Ritz, Mr. Gupta. Just for the two of you! The Ritz? Yes. We had our last kitty party there. A resounding success. I’m sure it was! Why don’t you join us the next time, Vandana! We’re having a bake sale at the club. Come early for cocktails. I certainly will. Will I not be invited? Look. He wants to come as well. Hey Figaro! Where have you been? Come sit with us... We’ve been waiting for you for over an hour, dear. Sorry guys! Apologies... There was an emergency at Maggie’s place. It was kind of a... What? What happened? This girl, this friend of Maggie’s I think she was... ...she was having this existential crisis and... ...I stayed up all night consoling the poor creature. Figaro! What rubbish! Now come on... Figaro, Figaro. Meet Mr Gupta... Hello Figaro. Pleasure meeting you. And Mrs Gupta... Hi. Figaro, your dad tells me... ...that you’re interested in corporate law? Well actually... No problem. Come over tomorrow! We’ll create a position of a research assistant for you! No problems at all. No, no, no. Not tomorrow. He has to finish his application to Harvard first. How about the day after? Three in the afternoon? Harvard? That’s great! We’re actually also trying for an MBA you know... Then he can always help Arun in his shipping. But somehow I feel that... ...law is far more appealing. Don’t you think? Definitely. Definitely. He will have a fantastic experience with us. Then he’ll go to Harvard... ...and then he’ll come back and join us as a junior partner. Isn’t it? - Figaro. Figaro. - Figaro. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Talking of shipping, Arun. How’s the business going? Well, not too terrible... It’s this bloody! Oh I’m sorry. It’s this recession, I’ve had to cut back by like 12.77 percent... I’ve had to get rid of some of my cargo ships and cancelled so many contracts. It’s all this ridiculous taxation. I mean what are the... what are the government folks doing? Forcing us back into the socialist hell-hole that we just climbed out of. I mean... just bloody ridiculous. How’s the tea? Hmm Lovely. Darjeeling Oolong. First flush. A cup a day and all your sorrows dissipate, Mr Gupta. Figs! You son of a-- ...no, not you! Actually, you… Where are you? Yeah, well, I’m just grabbing a bite... ...in Hauz Khas Village. Listen! Let’s go get some chocolate fudge. Right now? Yes! Now... I’m picking you up, ok? Bye. This is but the beginning! The battle is yet to come… This is but the beginning! The battle is yet to come… This is but the beginning! Look, you love writing... This is what you want to do! Why do you need to go along with it? Maggie... ...you’re just not going to get it! It’s my parents... ...they’re just from another planet. Figs... ...I thought you were better than this. Psycho parents isn’t exactly a novelty. We’ve all been there. Come up with something better! Yeah, well, I guess I’m not such a good writer after all. Listen, Maggie, tell me something… What’s the scene with this guy? Niz? I mean... ...so far, so good, I guess. It’s just that… Don’t get me wrong. I mean, I love him. He’s great and he’s so talented and... It’s just sometimes... ...you know, he doesn’t want to go out anywhere... ...doesn’t want to spend on anything. It’s a bit… Maybe that’s because he’s not loaded like you Maggie. Shut up. Drop the yuppie act, will you? Keep it real. What? Nothing, nothing. Well, at least you’re leaving me conscious this time around. Sorry, I have to go. We’ll chill some other time. You need a ride? No I think I’ll just hang here for a bit. Cool. Go, go, go play footsie or whatever it is you do. Oh, and I forgot. I’m out of hash. Can you give me some? Think I’m out as well, sorry. Shit. Ok, so... ...ask Mishra. Yeah I’ll do that. If I can find him that is. Ok, bye. Maggie! Yeah? Nothing, nothing… See you! Bye. Bye. "In a darkened land..." "He comes and goes." "In black and white." "He’ll pick you up." "When you’re feeling down." "The man with no heart." "He runs this town." "The Man with a Million Drugs." "He’s the Man with a Million Drugs." Oye Figs! Sit... Mishra! How are you? Same old. So... Yeah so.... Last night was an experience, yeah? Yeah well, guess you could say that. I mean you and Jay really hit it off? What? Are you crazy? No. Anyway I wanted to know if I could score some hash? Any chance I can get some... hash? Hash. Hash... Oh hash... Do you have some? Yes... certainly! Hash. Hash... Figs, looks like I’m out. You’re joking, right? No, no, no, I’m serious. Ok tell me, in the meantime... Could I interest you in some keta? I just scored it from our good friends over at the... ...Government of India veterinary institute. But what’s this? Ketamine. Horse tranquilizer. Yeah, well... No cream, man? No. Just check if you have any cream. M Cream. M Cream. The best hash in the world. One puff and nirvana. Sweet enough for Shiva himself. It’s gone. It’s gone my friend. It’s finished. It’s returned to the pantheon of the destroyer. Alas. In that case we mortals lie bereft. This is a dire situation! And round and round and round it goes. Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool. A comedy for the rich, a tragedy for the poor. Life, how does it matter anyway? It’s just a brothel. And round and round and round it goes. Arun, get up! We have to go for lunch to the Khots’. You know what they’re like... sticky. Come on. Oh dear. I’m ready, I’m ready. You know, Arun... I’ve been thinking, we should take Figs with us. What the hell for? Let the young lad do some work for a change. You remember Irina? Who? Mr and Mrs Khots little girl. Ah. It just so happens she’s come back from the US and she’s not so little anymore. Oh. I think she would make a great match for Figs. A very suitable couple. But I thought young Figs was besotted with, what’s her name, Maggie. Forget about Maggie. What was that noise? Figs! What’s going on? Hey guys. Where do you think you’re going? I’m just heading to the hills. I’ll be gone for a few days. What? Why? Road trip. Road trip? What are you talking about? Are you serious! Yeah, I should have told you this earlier but... You know, this is all very dramatic and awkward and stuff... So I’m just going to take your leave. See you guys! Figs! You’ve got to stop running if you really want to find what you’re looking for. Arun! Do something! Vandana! Do What? "Yes I’ll be chasing..." "...all you to the street." "I’ll be chasing. I’ll be racing..." "...you to the street." "To the street." See you later! Hello. Hey! Come on. Let’s go. Whoa. Oh Figs. You’ve met Jay, right? She went to school with Niz. Hi. You guys know each other? No... Thankfully. Oh. Oh. Maggie, I didn’t know she was coming. - Figs, relax. - You should have told me. - So what’s the big deal? - Maggie... I hope you have enough booze at least. I just got one bottle with me. Yeah. It’s at the back. - Niz, can you just check? - Yeah, yeah... At your service! So... Two bottles of vodka. Coke, vodka and more vodka. Maggie? What? I like vodka. No scotch? Nope. That must be corrected. Yeah. Scotch? All right. You drink whiskey? Yes. That’s nice. Cool, me too. We’ll pick it up on the way. Come on... Let’s go. Getting late... Ready guys? - You’ll tell me later. - Yeah I will. On the road again. None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. And there we were, children of chaos and anarchy. Escaping into the endless unknown. We are free. On the road again. Butter chicken and bread? Sir, it’s over. Ok. Mughlai chicken and bread? Sir, it’s over. Is anything available? - Sir, you tell me! - No you tell me! Chicken fry... - And bread? - Yes, sir. Done. With vegetables on the side. - Ok. - Thank you. So where are we spending the night? Oh... At this abandoned guest house just off the highway. My uncle owns it, he’s a minister. Abandoned? Yeah. I think it used to be Indira Gandhi’s guest house or something like that. But no one lives there anymore. Haunted house. Shut up, Niz. Don’t kid around. I’m scared of ghosts. Yeah, ghosts are so scary. Anyway screw that. Mababajagal here we come! I can smell the cream and it smells good. What is he talking about? We’re going to Dharamsala. What the hell is Mababajagal? Dharamsala? Jay, right... Mababajagal is this mythical magical place. The source of M Cream, this mythical magical hash. And... we’re all going to go look for it. And Figs... We are going to Dharamsala first. Jay and I’ve got an old friend there, Thupten. Plus she’s doing a write-up on Tibetans... ...in exile... ...and I’m taking photographs. Remember I told you? The assignment... What? What are you looking at me for? Will you grow up? Yeah... Maybe I will. When you stop being a self-righteous, little bimbo! Listen, relax. It’s not her fault. I think I’ve diagnosed your problem, Figaro. Really, what is it? You’re just a spoilt, selfish brat... ...who thinks of nothing other than his own petty existence. And you’re just a hypocritical little bimbo. Hypocritical? Oh yeah? People like you... ...spout shit about this cause and that cause... And you sit here doing nothing about it. It’s almost funny if it weren’t so pathetic. I do what I do... ...because it affects me. Ok? It affects me when there’s a random terrorist attack in my city. It affects me when the government goes on and on about our rising GDP... ...when a majority of our people are still poor. And it affects me that no one gives a damn about Tibet. Because there’s no oil there, there’s only people. It affects me so fuck you! It affects you? Miss, I hate to say it... ...but you’re a walking cliché. Come on... Unbelievable. Figs. What’s your problem? Drama. I love it. "And for all those locks and keys..." "...yeah, we leave them all behind..." "For the leaves and for the trees..." "For the countless lullabies." Spooky. Shut up. Sleeping arrangements. Shotgun, Niz and I will take the big bedroom. Jay, you can have the other one. And Figs, the couch is all yours. Yay! Niz, make the drinks quickly! That’s what I’m doing. Yuck! This place is so dirty. This place is beautiful. I am so exhausted. Here you go! Thank you. And here you go... A toast to us... a toast to us... ...and to the dangerous promise of the unknown road ahead. I’ll drink to that! Cheers. So... Do you guys do these road trip things often? You think? Getting Niz to go someplace is like getting Anna Hazare to clean up corruption. Easier said than done. Well unlike some people I have to earn a living. What are you going to do? Working class blues... What’s with that attitude? Nothing... It’s just that you seem to forget that... ...we did go to Jim Corbett over winter break. For, like, two days! And please that’s because Rishi was going through this animal planet phase. It doesn’t count. Who’s Rishi? Rishi Rastogi. We used to hangout a lot, earlier... He came out. Yeah... became quite an issue. His dad was furious, threw him out and all that stuff. That’s sad... ...we modern Indians aren’t as open minded as we pretend to be. Anyway... He moved in with this guy somewhere in North Campus and... ...I guess we drifted apart. Seconds please. That was quick! So should we play some music? I’m on it. Much obliged. Miss Bose. Come on, sexy. Show me some moves! Ok. Come on. What are you doing? Nothing. Do you write? No. Well, it looks like you’re writing. Ok, well, yeah... A little bit. You know, Jay? Hmm... I was meaning to talk to you about this... ...well, look, I am sorry, all right. I know I was a little hard on you earlier. Is that a smile? No. Looks like one. Looks can be deceiving. Uh huh. Actually, Figs... I’ve given it some thought and we’re not so different, you and I. You’re drunk already? No! Well maybe a little... Thank god. Can you imagine being sober around those two? No, I can’t... I digress, the point is that we both view the world in very similar ways. Uh huh. Scary as that sounds. I mean, think about it... It’s a mess! On the one hand we’re the fastest growing economy, the biggest democracy, Poster boy for all things awesome... And on the other hand? Where was I? The other hand... Right... Fucking chaos. And you get that. Like me. Oh yeah, I do? Yeah... Yeah, a lot of people don’t. Or at least they don’t seem to. Do you know what I mean? Not really. Good night, guys. Good night. Till the morning comes. Go get a room, already... What do you think we are doing? I don’t know what he sees in her. He’s like the perfect guy. Perfect guy? So... I was saying something important. Were you? Yeah, about how we’re not so... Exactly. Hey, can you pass me the bottle please? Might as well. Wow. I’m proud of you, you didn’t seem like the drinking type. Why not? Stereotypes are dangerous. Yeah, well... you just seem extremely wholesome! Nice, simple, girl next door. Huh... What? What does that mean? Yeah, you know... ...you Bengali women... ...are just a bunch of cliquish, pseudo intellectuals. Are you kidding me? No. You Punjabi boys are just a bunch of cheap, flashy brats! At least you’re easy on the eyes... Is that a compliment? No. So, I was saying... As you were saying... Yeah. Never mind. Where are you going? Got to get more booze silly. Look at this woman... You got to go to sleep silly! No. Let’s go! Get up. Come on, Get up man! You, evil boy. What are you doing? Put me down. - You are getting to bed. - I’m fine, Figaro. No, you are not. Sleep! - I don’t want to sleep. - Yes. You are getting to bed, right now. No, please... - Booze, Can I have more booze? - No. Goodnight. Goodnight. See you. - Hold on. - It's stuck. Come on. Move, ok, move, let me do it. Hey! You’re late. You’re grumpy. Whatever. Can I just dump this? Good morning. Hey... Welcome, finally. Let's go. All aboard? - Yes, let’s go. - So hung over. Shut up. "Speak no evil." "Don’t speak evil." "Speak no evil." "Don’t speak evil." "Speak no evil." This whole whacked out world is just too frustrating. A flashy postcard with the inscription... "This is my simple religion..." "There’s no need for temples, no need for complicated philosophy..." "...the philosophy is kindness." So, it’s really that simple, is it? Delhi, 1984. Bombay, 1992. Gujarat, 2002. Assam, 2012. In the name of religion, countless men, women and children butchered alive! All in the name of religion? Or in the game of politics? This whole whacked out world is just too frustrating. Thupten! Jay! How are you? Absolutely fine. I wasn’t sure when you guys were coming. - I know, we got here much earlier. - Thupten! - Hey, Niz... - How are you? I’m good. How are you? Very well. Ah! This is Maggie. - Hi. - Hello. And... Yeah, that is Figs. - Hey, how are you? - Very good. So, who’s hungry? - Me. - Me. Great! So, Figs and Maggie, how do you like 'Little Lhasa'? I love it. It’s gorgeous. It’s a strange place. How so? I mean, yeah it’s gorgeous of course... ...but there’s this strange brew of politics and religion. Things that I find completely unnecessary. It’s a beautiful place, caught up in a pointless exercise. I mean, Tibet’s never going to be free ... And praying isn’t going to solve anything. It’s all pretty pointless really. The cause is hopeless, perhaps. But not the fight... I believe in fighting. My faith has certainly helped me in that. Well, I’m not so convinced... Frankly religion hasn’t done much other than divide and destroy... It’s an emotional crutch. Figs has a point there. Ah! I do? I mean, yeah I do... Of course. Movements need to be organic, they need to matter. They need to be real. That’s when things can change but very often that reality... ...gets sidelined by many forces, including religion... ...I don’t know if I’m making any sense. People believing in something is different than people being told to believe in something. The source is love after all. I agree that you need to question religion if it invalidates love. I think... I don’t know. Just live and let live. I mean, that’s my point! That’s a flawed point, Niz! Our generation achieves nothing because we’re passive by nature... And the funny part is, we have a voice, we just don’t know it. - There is nothing passive about-- - Ok! Let’s just change the topic. Aren’t you sick of her soapbox lectures? I know I am. In Buddhism, we have a saying. 'A straw floats on the surface of water...' '...but a precious gem placed upon it sinks’. You know what? I don’t get it. Ok I’ll see you guys tomorrow. Good night! Hey, hey! - Oh. Hey! - What’s going on? Phew. It was getting really intense in there. Had to get out. So, you like freezing? I like breathing in fresh air while it’s still around. You know, you were really drunk the other night? You do remember some of that, don’t you? Was I? Which night? Precisely. You’re very fond of Maggie. Why do you say that? It’s pretty obvious Figs. Yeah. Yeah well, I am... I was. But I’m not so sure anymore, though. We should go. No we shouldn’t. We should stay right here. Prisoners of the night. Good morning, sir. Hey, slept well? Like a rock. Tea? Mmm... Perfect. Here... Thanks. And, here you go! - Toast, butter and jam. - Yummy! Niz told me you guys are going to Mababajagal? Have you heard of it? Some say it’s the oldest democracy on earth. Really? And they have the best hash too. What are you reading? An article by Marie Sartre, this French journalist. Oh my god! I love her. She’s fantastic. She really writes it like it is, you know! Yeah. Do you know that she’s been in this area for quite some time now? Here? I had no idea. She has been writing extensively on this Paradise Found project. What’s that? This international chain is trying to build a luxury resort. They are soon going to cut down the forest. What? The villagers are protesting, the protest is gaining momentum. Is it? Of course the media and activists from all over have been pouring in. And... I’m sure they could use all the help they can get. Since you are going to be in the area... ...it might be worth stopping by. Thupten, I’d love to! But it’ll depend on the others... I’ll definitely try. "Looking back on life." "I sometimes wonder why..." "...it takes so long to find..." "...a way to make it right." "Free, free riding." "It’s my life." "Free, free riding." "Free..." Hello. Is this Mababajagal? Honey, It ain’t. Mababajagal’s on the other side of the mountain. Thirty miles as the crow flies. Join us. Thank you. Where are you folks coming from? Dharamsala. Well I reckon you took a wrong turn someplace. It’s funny how that happens! I’m Vishnu Das by the way. Pleased to make your acquaintance. And this, here, is my little lady. Hello. You can call me Sunshine Daydream. Jayashri Bose. Niyaz. Hi. What’s your name, sweetheart? Meghna. Figs, I’m Figs. All right. So we’re all friends now. So Vishnu sahib, where are we exactly? Oh. The Elysian fields... ...the garden of Eden, the abode of Aphrodite. We just call it the commune. It’s just up around the corner. I don’t know what it is but it keeps getting stronger. Painted faces beneath the diamond sky, dancing bodies on the emerald earth. Flowers in her hair and madness in her eyes. It’s just up around the corner. I feel like an outlaw, a fugitive on the run. I guess there is no turning back. Don’t knock it if you haven’t tried it! Like books are food for the mind, LSD is food for the soul. Call me a dirty old hippie, if you like... ...but if we all smoked pot and tripped on acid every now and then, the world would be a lot groovier... ...I do believe it! You and Figs would get along great! Yeah? Hey! Hi! Let’s go. Where’s Niz? - I left some stuff in the car. - Oh! Niz is such an idiot. I mean, we’re completely lost... What a mess. Chill. We’ll find the way. It’s ok. Is everything ok? Yeah. Thanks for your concern! What do you mean? Figs, just because you’ve found a girlfriend, will you forget your friends? What do you mean, Maggie? Huh? Nothing. Forget it. I first came to this country in 1968, part of the infamous hippie exodus. It’s sort of been home ever since... Got myself a little shack around the corner. I give tours, lectures... ...write books on meditation. Yeah. For a kid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I’d say that’s doing all right! Say, I’d love to have you kids over sometime! You don’t need to buy anything! Well it wouldn’t hurt if you did... If we did what? Vishnu Das has invited us to his charming establishment. Oh, what’s that? He runs a shack and he might have some things that will interest us. What do you guys say? - Sounds good. - Yeah sure. All right, let’s go! Hey Mr. Vishnu! Do you happen to have any decent accessories to go along with this one? That one’s a real beauty, ain’t she? I’ve got some hash if that’s what you mean, kid. But it ain’t no cream! You know the government folks are building some... ...glitzy resort between here and Mababajagal. And there’s been trouble with the locals! We can’t get any decent hash. Is the trouble bad? Well there ain’t no such thing as good trouble! You know, my advice is if you all are planning on heading there anyway... ...you all might as well wait. Oh no! I can’t wait, I’m sick of waiting, please. Well, patience is a virtue, sweetheart. And you strike me as the virtuous kind. Well, I’ll take this one. For posterity then. You won’t regret it! Sir. We’re running low on booze and... ...I get that you don’t have any cream but is there some other way you could sort us out? Well, let’s see if I can help you all out. Could I interest you in some acid? Nothing floats your boat quite like LSD. Mr. Vishnu, trust me I know... Ok, we’ll take three stamps. Three? Make that four. Are you sure about this? Don’t knock it if you haven’t tried it, right? Right. Great. Slowly, slowly stay my mind. Slowly everything happens. The gardener may water a hundred times... ...but when the season comes, there is fruit. This banana is fantastic. Did you just say that? It’s magical. I don’t think I’ve seen an orange as orange as that. This orange, actually, ever before. You’re messing up my picnic. Are you nuts? Look! This orange... Yes, madam? It must die. It must die... Listen! Sun king plays on my face. Crystal parliaments shatter easy. Sun king plays on my face. Love is atomic sugar. Sun king plays on my face. Two strands merge. Guys, we should probably hit the road soon... Food is good. Food is good. I love food. I love food too. I just lost my appetite. - Good morning, kids. - Good morning. Coffee? I don’t mind if I do. How was the acid trip? Full power. Jay? Glad to be of service. - Is everything ok? - Yeah. Darling... Darling, make love. No darling! Make love not... I was going to say make love not war. She’s been mad as a wet hen these last few days. It’s our annual Moon Rave tonight. Lots to do... Moon rave? What’s that? Well, a bunch of kids get together every other night. They do drugs and have sex and then they do more drugs and have more sex. That’s pretty much it. Ok. Sounds like fun. We should go right? I don’t know, we should get going. Come on! We can hit the road tomorrow. Do we always have to do what you want? Niz! We’ve come this far, we might as well go all the way. Let’s just do what Jay wants. This place was such a happy accident. Yeah. Maggie’s party seems like so long ago. Doesn’t it, Figaro? It seems like years ago. And you were so friendly to me that night. Hey! But is it not love that knows how to make... ...smooth things rough and rough things smooth? That’s deep. It is. It’s not me, it’s Vikram Seth. Ah. I was just thinking that things change. Yeah. But... I mean, come on, wouldn’t life be boring if they didn’t? I guess. Sometimes things get more complicated than they should be. I mean, look at the four of us... Yeah. Changes upon changes, we are more or less the same. Vikram Seth? Close. Simon and Garfunkel. Idiot. Let’s head back! We have a long night ahead. Oh god! The rave. Give me two whiskeys, yeah? Insane. What? This is insane! What... What? It’s not your scene? Come on, look at this place! It’s beautiful. I don’t know. I always saw the world in shades of black and white. And now there is all this color! Yeah. It’s funny that you say that because... ...I just feel like there’s so much color... Now, I finally see a bit of black and white. Hey! Vishnu Das is shooting up. What? Vishnu Das is shooting up! Shooting up? Brown Sugar, baby. Heroin. Maggie, this is... Aren’t you a little bit curious? Maggie this is not... I want you to do this with me... Maggie, listen! Under any other circumstances... ...maybe I would have But this but this... What? Speak up! I can’t hear you. Maggie! It is not a good idea, come on... What is wrong with you? Whatever. Welcome to the twilight zone. Nice place. Are you afraid, sweetheart? Fear is the mother of morality. It’s my first time. I’ll be gentle. What the fuck... What’s going on here? - Figs! - Hey! Stay groovy. Vishnu Das! Grow the fuck up. Show me your hand... What is this? This is dangerous! Who the hell do you think you are? Who me? I’m your friend, Figs. Well, I was chilling. - Chilling... You call this chilling? - Yeah. Ok, Ms. Rebel-without-a-cause, go... Go! Chill... Hypocrite. What? You heard me! You’re a hypocrite. Maggie, listen! First of all, I care for you, all right? And second of all, you shouldn’t be messing with this! It’s dangerous stuff. Maggie, you’re crazy or what? What’s going on with you, Maggie? - Niz! - What the hell was that? - Niz! - What the fuck was that? Nothing. Take it easy. Who the fuck do you think you are? Calm down... Whoa! easy man! Fucking easy! Niz! Niz... Come on, Niz! Stop it. Niz! Niz! Nothing happened, ok, nothing-- You know, I tried really hard to be what you wanted me to be. And I did it because I loved you. But I guess love is just a four letter word. Fine! You’re not even worth it. Oh God... Where is everyone? Excuse me. Where did they go? - Who? - The others I was staying with. I don’t know what you are talking about. - Did they leave a message? - I don't know. Hello stranger! Hey, Maggie! Where were you? I was going to wake you but... ...then I decided against it. Ouch, you poor thing. Anyway, come, let’s go... Where to? Come, get your bags. Let’s get out of here! What? Say something... Where’s Jay? Where’s Niz? What's going on? I don’t know... I think they left. It’s not the end of the world. Where are you going? I don't know. We could go anywhere, someplace far away... You just let them leave? I didn’t let them do anything, ok? They just did. And who cares anyway? Maggie, what’s the matter with you? What’s the matter with me? So this is all my fault now? Typical. You know you created such a mess last night. And I was only trying to help you... You try so hard to stand out... ...and because of that at the end of the day... ...you are just another conformist. Am I? So what does that make you then? Bye Maggie. Figs, come on! It’s you and me... So what? That’s it then? Yeah. Look, Figs! I know I fucked up... ...and everything was a big mess... ...but you’re my friend. You’re supposed to be there for me. Maggie look... ...you know I’m always there for you. But... ...just this time I think you are going to have to figure this out on your own. I am sorry. Sir. It’s time to check out! You need to leave. What are you saying? - I’ll leave in half an hour. - No, sir. Right now. - Half an hour! - No, sir. Right now! Ok. Tea? Yeah. Nice eye. Thanks. Maggie left. So did Niz. Oh. He told me to tell you he is sorry for knocking you senseless. Yeah. No hard feelings? Anyway. Figs, I know what happened last night wasn’t your fault. Oh, really? We’re ok, just so you know. Are you sure about that? I think so. Yeah. It just feels like some kind of weird nightmare. As the old adage goes... ...‘shit happens’. Look, I’m not promising anything. You don’t have to. I screwed up. I thought you would have left with Niz. I almost did... ...but here we are. Indeed. I... I don’t really know how to say this... I’m not good at expressing myself. But I stayed... ...because... ...because I wanted to. I’m catching a bus in a bit. A bus? Where are you going? You heard about that resort they are building? An entire village is going to be completely destroyed... ...and unless someone does something about it. The government’s been paid off, surprise-surprise! Don’t tell me you want to go and save the world after this? Anyhow... Thupten says they need all the help that they can get. Marie Sartre is there. She is covering the protest and... ...since our road trip has come to this untimely end... ...we should go. We should help in whatever way we can. Sounds boring. But after all we’ve been through... I think boring is exactly what I need. Let’s go! We are burning embers in a world of deepening shadow... ...and the road we tread on has no end. But there is still the sky... ...the windy mountain and the river below it. So let’s tread on. Let’s climb to the highest peaks of our dying kingdom. For there is still the sky... ...the windy mountain... ...and the river below it. There’s nobody here. Ok, who is this journalist we are looking for, again? Marie Sartre. Any relation of Jean Paul? Ha ha. Excuse me! Hello. Hello. I don’t see anybody around, where did the villagers go? Go that way... That way? - Thank you. - Welcome. Mr. Hariharan! We’ve tied around 800 Rakhis so far. Really! Good job. - We are almost done. - Yes. These two have come from Delhi. Perhaps from the media. What do you want? Nothing! We’re here to help you. We’re not from the media. Marie Sartre? That’s me! Hi. Hi, my name is Jayshri Bose. That’s Figs. We heard through a friend that you were... ...in the area and about what’s going on here. And we thought we could, well, volunteer? Excellent. Welcome on board. Thank you. This is my dear friend Ram Hariharan. Hello. He’s chief coordinator of the Resistance. That’s what we call ourselves. Why don’t you brief them. I have to file a petition. Ok? It’s a throwback to the 'Chipko movement'. These Rakhis are symbolic of both protest and protection. So what exactly is going to happen if this resort does get built? Well a lot of things... In a nutshell, this resort will signal... ...the death of the people of these hills and of the forest they love. We’ve had some recent success in stalling the project... ...but unfortunately... ...we just found out that... ...the Environment Ministry has given the go ahead for the resort. They are expected to start pulling down trees... ...and seizing land... - ...any day now. - That's terrible. But, I mean... ...how can they give a go ahead like this? That’s so strange. Political pressure, vested interests. Most importantly, moolah! Everyone can be bought if the price is right. Don’t mind my asking but aren’t you a journalist? Yes. So shouldn’t it be part of your job to be non-partisan... ...or unbiased or whatever it is you guys call it? Well, I’ll leave this to the Indian media... ...since they seem to be doing such a great job. Good one. There is a difference, you know... ...between being biased and being true to yourself. There is a difference between hyping a cause... ...and passionately advocating a cause you believe in. Radha... Here! This is for you... That’s enough. Eat! Tomorrow’s a big day. Roti, anyone? Yes, please. Marie. I’ve been meaning to tell you this... Don’t really know how but... I really admire your writing. What you say, your words... ...they’re honest. And that’s just so rare. It’s amazing to finally meet you! Thanks. I’m glad to meet both of you too. It’s good to know we are not alone. So how long have you been here? For some months now. It sounds crazy. It’s obvious that things are not how they should be. The value of our methods and means of protest is less obvious. Time will tell. We are nothing but a moment’s sunlight fading in the grass. I have no idea what that means but it sounds beautiful! Marie... ...what made you fight for this cause? What cause? I believe in saving these people and their forest. What about the bigger picture? What about corruption in India in general? Do you think we can fight that? I do... ...but with a pinch of salt, you might say. What do you mean? I believe in the potential of the cause. We stand witness to the birth of a real revolution. I believe in that. So, what brought you two here to this picturesque battlefield. Is everything ready? Yes, it’s all ready. We are filing another petition. It won’t make a difference. In any case, we will demonstrate tomorrow! Can we help in any way? Of course! We also want to do something! Yes. We will need all the help we can get. All right then... ...let’s all gather in the morning. Are there going to be a lot of people at this demonstration tomorrow? Villagers and activists, lawyers and other professionals... ...farmers and truck drivers, teachers and students like yourselves. The revolutionaries of modern India. Do you think it’s going to make a difference? Who knows? The fact of the matter is that we are taking a stand... ...and that’s important. It’s one thing to call yourself a revolutionary... ...and quite another thing to live like one. People have enough things in the world... ...to be really pissed about right now, I know that. But... I just wonder what this struggle is doing... ...for the people of this village. And that’s scary. Well this movement makes sense to me in the now. That’s why I support it. Fair enough for you, I suppose. Still hungry? Thanks. No. But I could really use a drink right about now! Really? That should do... Oh, yes, thank you! "If I've a babe in town, Babe." "It's just when you're around, Babe." "If I've a babe in town, Babe." "It's just when you're around, Babe." "I caught a long slow freight, Babe." "Bound out for Texas state, Babe." "I caught a long slow freight, Babe." "Bound out for Texas state, Babe." Marie? Oh. "Three days I hung around, Babe." "That lonesome Texas town, Babe." Let’s dance? No, I can’t. "Said you was sick and low, Babe." "Said you was dyin' slow, Babe." "Said you was sick and low, Babe." Oh... "I took my car yet , Babe." "So as to return to you, Babe." "I took my car yet , Babe." "So as to return to you, Babe." "When I got off that train, Babe." "You couldn't call my name, Babe." "When I got off that train, Babe." "You couldn't call my name, Babe." This forest has given me life... ...and I shall stand by it till I die. My brothers and sisters... ...they call this project Paradise Found. But I call it Paradise Lost! Our forests will be cut... ...our land stolen, our homes broken! A state that attacks her own people... ...is a state doomed to self-annihilation! My brothers and sisters! They say this resort is a symbol of development. At what cost? The death of our forest? The death of our villages? At what cost? This resort is not a symbol of development... ...it is a symbol of corruption! My brothers and sisters, rise! Embrace our trees! Save them from death... It is the wealth of our hills. We won’t let them build this resort! Ma’am, what is the civil society doing about this? We won’t let them build this resort! Are you willing to go to jail for this? No comments. Thank you. Friends. Today is a dark day. The illegitimate government of India has declared war upon us! This luxury resort is the bastard child of greedy politicians... ...and urban decadence. It is a modern day mockery of our age old values! An insult to our Gandhian ways. The people of these hills, they are victims. They are victims of a malaise which afflicts us all. That malaise is corruption. They are the ones to be sacrificed at the altar of avarice. Mark my words, we shall have revenge. Let the ruling classes tremble at the prospect of revolution. India against corruption! What does it mean to be a revolutionary? The war rages on... We were knocked down by the crushing force of a terrible defeat. The futility of our actions was only too obvious. The extent of our insignificance proved absolute. If only I had stayed on... But what could we do? It was over. What does it mean to be a revolutionary? The war rages on... I was wrong when I thought I was free... ...we are all enslaved in chains of our own making. What does it mean to be a revolutionary? The war rages on. We’ve come a long way... ...but there’s no destination in sight. Faith is the bird... ...that feels the light when the dawn is still dark. That’s deep. Thanks... It’s not me, it’s... ...Rabindranath Tagore. But it’s frustrating, you know, all the same. What is? It’s been sixty years since independence... ...and we’re still fighting for the same thing... ...for our freedom. Someone once said... ..."When the power of love overcomes the love of power..." "...that’s when the world will know peace." Who said that? Rabindranath Tagore, only? Close. Jimi Hendrix. We lost it, right? Yeah. I guess so... What is 'it'? You know, we’ve lost this battle I suppose. But you know as well as I do Jay... ...that there’s a thousand people fighting... ...a thousand battles every single day... ...in this crazy country of ours. I wonder where those two are. Niz and Maggie. I don’t know... ...but I’m glad you are with me. What happened? Where the hell are we? Do you have any water? Did you see that? No, did you? "I am a poor wayfaring stranger..." "Wandering through this world of woe." "And there's no sickness, no toil or danger..." "In that bright land to which I go." "I am going there to see my sister." "I’m going there no more to roam." "I am only going over Firdaus." "I am only going over home." It’s been quite the journey, Figaro. It certainly has, Miss Bose. How do you know it’s over? I never said it was. Here we are... And now what?
