Are you Cockshute Towers? Cockshute Towers, if you please. All the same to me. Heidi. Pfft. Heidi, come on. Oh! Morning. - Oh! - Oh! Morning, Mrs. B. - Ah! - Oh! Ruined! You, Mrs. B, what a memory. You stupid girl, What you want to go screaming like that for? Sorry Mrs. Burgess, Somebody pinched my. Rogers, you cheeky devil. Will you just stop cluttering up my kitchen And 'urry on upstairs. Mr. Hampton'll be waiting and you know how particular he is to have things just right at breakfast. Now come on, off with you, I said off! Go on, you two, off And Polly, you can give me a hand with these trays. Hampton here. Mrs. Burgess here. Ah, Mrs. Burgess, good morning. Breakfast on it way up. Yes, thank you very much. You're late, Rogers. I beg your pardon, Mr. Hampton. Maud. Sorry Mr. Hampton. So you should be. Ah, Mimi. Good morning, Monsieur Hampton. Very nice, my dear, very nice. Are you sure you can manage that? Oh, I'm used of carrying heavy things, Monsieur Hampton. Can you manage a paper, too? Oh, just put it on top, Monsieur Hampton. Ha ha. Oh, what a place to have the times. Good morning, milady! A beautiful day. The sun's in the sky, And Lord Cockshute is in his bath. Oh, breakfast. I really feel like it this morning. Good to start the day on something hot. I do agree. A roll, perhaps? Exactly, Hampton. Always my pleasure to serve, milady. I've instructed the staff to be less wasteful When polishing the floors and furniture, milady. Our special preparation of linseed oil must be reserved For only the most delicate pieces. It is very important that every area is covered. Each little crevice must be attended to Using the fingers to rub gently into the corners. I have instructed That all cushions be shaken and plumped up. That the curtains should be hung out and aired And all the carpets well rushed and beaten. Running a place like this Does need a strong hand in the right place. You're so thoughtful, Hampton. I try to keep the staff up to the mark. It's so difficult though, When one sets high standards. They are apt to fall just when you want them to rise but I trust, milady, you will never have cause to complain Of any lack of effort on my part. Never, Hampton. Oh, milord. How you should expect I should help you When you always take off my. Oh, milord. Oh, you're so strong. You want to hurt Mimi, to cause hurt? Oh, no, no, no, I mean yes, yes! Oh. - Oh, please milord, not now. When? If you behave yourself, I shall come undress you tonight. Oh, jolly good. - See you later. - Yes! Oh dear. Oh, tripes. Oh, where's the wife? Sorry to bother you, my dear. Just can't find this stud. Can't seem to, it always falls out just when I think I've got it in. Oh I know. Allow me, milord. Oh, thank you, Hampton. Nothing ever seems to go right when you're in a hurry. You in a hurry, Randy, whatever for? Point with the lawyers, my dear. Oh, tiresome business, all about the estate. There you are, milord. Ah, thank you, Hampton. See you at luncheon, my dear. Hampton. Gorgeous beast. Ah, it's in perfect condition as always. I believe you. Well, it only needs the right touch, you know. Not many people have it, Rogers. You're fortunate. Thank you, milady. Ah, it's a regular piece of strapping. That works wonders. You must show me how you do it, Rogers. Later. Your Lordship. Your Lordship? Oh, sir, you've done it again. Not quite. I'm talking about your breakfast, You haven't touched a thing. Can I help you? Yes, yes, my notes. Thanks. Mrs. Burgess will be ever so upset If I take the tray back like this. You must eat something. No, I can't stop, Maud, I'm just getting to a vital part. Look, why don't I give you your food While you go on working? Thanks, Maud, you're a good girl With you, how can I be anything else? Funny stuff, this cow chew. It's kedgeree, actually. - What? - Your breakfast, kedgeree. Mrs. Burgess special. I was referring to this. It's gotta be caught at just the right temperature. I tell you, it's a little discovery of mine, this India rubber solution in here, I found that by adding minute amounts of acids, you can stretch it until it's so fine You can hardly feel it. Good heavens. Well, what's it for? Well, even though it's so fine, it's completely waterproof So you see, it will be invaluable as a cover for-- Yes? I really shouldn't be talking to you like this. Well stand up then, Otherwise your epiglottis will have a seizure. It's something I'm making for Lady Cockshute, it's a secret. Now you mustn't breathe a word of this to anyone, you understand? Oh yes, your Lordship, I promise. You all right down there, Master Peregrine? Yes thank you, Mellons. - Oh. - Ah! Right, come here. - Oh. - Ah! Oh! If you stop struggling, I'll show you a thing or two. If I stop struggling, I can show you a thing-- Oh! Oh, Rogers. Here, what was that? What's that? Oh, Rogers. Oh you rotten thing, you. And what have we here? Rogers, give me back my blouse, What are you doing, you're taking all my clothes off. Rogers! Oh. Rogers. Oh hello, Mr. Hampton. I was just getting some hay for bedding down. Quite so. Far be it from me to interrupt your labours, Rogers, But I do have a urgent errand. Oh yeah. Would you care to take a ride? Well, certainly, I was just about-- To the village? Oh yeah, very well, Mr. Hampton. I want this sent off by telegraph. His Lordship's last farthing On the two o'clock at Newmarkets. Right you are, Mr. Hampton. Now, we only got five minutes, girl. Great. Wonder if his Lordship's got a good tip? Oh no, he hasn't. I mean inside information. So do I. You know, you know Hampton's a better punter. He does pretty well with the horses, does ol' Hampton. I was once raped on a racecourse by the wardens-- Yoink! You don't really mean that, do you? Well... Come in, stepmater. Perry, darling, I really am most flattered Being allowed into your private sanctum. Sometime I must let you into mine. It is rather exciting, isn't it? Yes. It's all for you. Yes, Perry. Well, you know how I feel about you, mater? Tell me. Well, you've always been so kind and loving just like a real mother. Oh, I could never be that. So I've been carrying out a little exercise down here by myself. Oh, you shouldn't do that, it makes you deaf. I've got a surprise, quite a big one. Don't tell me, let me find out the hard way. All right, close your eyes. Oh, can't I look? No, I'll tell you when. Oh don't, I get so frightened in the dark. Please stop, step mater, no. This is the way. Let me show you. Feel that. Perry. Oh, Perry. What do think? I'm speechless. I don't know what to say. So that's what you've been working at all the time? These sheaths'll protect your plants from rain, hail, or snow. No worries when it comes to the flower show, mater. And you've been doing all this for me? You are a darling, Perry. You deserve a big kiss. These sheaths have been made so light and elastic That they'll grow with the stretch of the plant. How clever. The only trouble is that I can't demonstrate that quickly. No, you really need something you can experiment with, Something that expands itself. Mater, you're marvellous, I've just got the very thing. You have? Yes, it grows from six inches to 12 just like that. Oh! I'll show you, hang on a minute. Mater. This is what you were thinking of, isn't it? Of course, dear, what else? Excellent brew of yours, Hampton. Glad you like it, milord. Yes, help yourself, old fella. Thank you, milord. May one venture to inquire as to what has cast your Lordship Into this slough of despond? We're not broke yet. Snotty. Snotty, milord? Yes, you know, used to live in the village, father kept the shop. Confounded fella. What everyone wanted, he didn't have. Ah, Snotty Shuttleworth. That's the fella. Went away, made a fortune. Well, he's back. I had heard, milord But I don't think we should let it upset our equilibrium. You don't know what game he's playing. I have a pretty good idea. Question is, will he or won't he. I should think there's very little doubt. Oh dear, what should we do, Where should we all go? Go, milord? Yes, when Snotty chucks us out of Cockshute Towers. I've been trying to explain to you, Hampton. You shouldn't drink brandy in the morning, you know, dulls your brain. Oh, I do beg pardon, milord. If you just explain. Yeah, well getting down to bare facts. Yes, milord? He's taken over the mortgage and all our family debts And you know they amount to a considerable sum. I begin to comprehend. You mean he's issued a ultimatum? Yeah, now we're getting to the crux of the matter. The crux indeed. One month to pay. One month or we're out! He's always fancied himself as lord of the manor. Oh, it's too ghastly to contemplate. Intolerable. Somebody's got a bit out. It fancy just is. What's that? Thought of Cockshute In the hands of that little upstart. Have no fears, milord, we shall contrive. Hampton, you're a great comfort to me. My pleasure to serve, milord. Ah, funny to think of Snotty being back. Do you remember the day we dumped him in the goldfish pond? He caught us smoking in the shrubbery. Threatened to sneak to our respective fathers. Little beggar was peeping at us through the bushes. Ah, I was waiting for you, Lady Kitty. You frightened Ramrod to death. Allow me to apologise. You're not even allowed here at all-- - Now don't-- - Get out of my way! You take that high tone with me, my girl, my word with you, hearing what's in the wind, You'll be down on your knees to me. You mean on your level.

Hampton, come on. Reinforcements. Reinforcements have arrived, milord. After him, Hampton. Put me down at once my word, you're gonna be sorry for this. You're the one who's going to be sorry. Strewth, when I'm head of Cockshute Towers, You will treat me somewhat differently, Hampton. Mr. Hampton, if you please. If that day happens, I very much doubt You can do what you ruddy well like. There we go. Flaming sharks. I'll get you for this, Hampton. Didn't you like my dress? It's beautiful, yes? But why do you keep taking it off? Because I like what's underneath better. Oh, Mimi, Mimi. Mimi, I'll buy you lots of dresses, my dear, I'll buy you them with necklines getting lower And hemlines getting higher. Oh, I know it's all going to end my dear But I just hope I'm there when it happens. Oh. Milord. Hampt-- I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're dressing, milord But I thought I'd better remind you of the time. Oh, what on earth for, oh really, Hampton? Begging your pardon, milord But you called a family conference for 6:30. Oh yes, so I did, oh, I'd quite forgotten. Quite so, milord. Oh yes, I suppose I better break the bad news. The sooner I get it over with, the better. If I may suggest, milord, It is a little late in the day for sunbathing. Oh, oh dear, yes. You can rely on me to finish it off here, milord. Monsieur Hampton. Hampton, I've been thinking. Really, milord? Yes, this conference, you should be there. If you say so, milord. Oh I do, I do. Yes, someone's got to come up with an idea. Oh, I'm sure you both will come up with something. Ah, zut alors! Oh Rogers, do give over. Why? You like it, don't you? Well I've got me work to do. Well, you just carry on. - Oh. - And I'll just carry on. Honestly, don't you ever think of anything else But making love to girls? Well, course I do. What? Girls making love to me. Ah,. Oh, oh yeah. Here, someone's coming. Oh! Come in, everyone. Come in and sit down. Sit, Heidi. The situation's very delicate, I don't know which way to turn. Papa, what is all this fuss about? I hope it won't take too long, I've left my bunsens burning. Well, you see, it's about, Hampton, how would you explain it? Oh, there's no getting away from it. We're in a tight squeeze. If I understand you correctly, milord, unless you find somewhere in the region of 100,000 pounds, We are all going to be out on our. I'm afraid that is the position, my dear. If that's all, pater, Do you mind if I return to the laboratory? I have a quick test to finish before dinner. Peregrine, I despair of you. Haven't you got anything better to do with your time Instead of fiddling about down there? Randy, I don't think you should be so hard on Perry. I mean, it's not like drinking or gambling like so many young men these days. like so many young men these days. Nonsense, rubber sheaths indeed. They'll never catch on. Oh, let's keep to the point, papa. What are we going to do? Wish I knew, Kitty. What about the family jewels? Yes, couldn't we sell them? Yes, I'm afraid they don't amount to much. It's quite right, They're all a sham. Pater! Sold them some time ago, Temporary embarrassment, you know. The glories of our past are now paste. Hampton will find a way. If you want me, madam, I shall always be there, somehow. Oh, what a man you are. There is the old solution Of advantageous marriage. Of course! Kitty should marry Shuttleworth, the estate will stay in the family And nothing will change. Oh yes it does! Me! Why should I be the sacrifice? Why not Perry? Well I can't marry him, really. Oh don't be so silly. I don't want to. And I don't want to marry Shuttleworth. I wouldn't marry him if he was the last man on earth. I won't do it. I won't, I won't, I won't. I'd rather marry Hampton. Yes, much rather. Thank you, Lady Kitty, I'm very flattered. Well, Seems like you're our last chance, Perry. Glad that's all settled, then. I can't. I mean, I don't know an heiress. No silly, but I do, Betsy Ann Dureneck. She was at Lucerene with me, remember? Her father's one of those American millionaires Absolutely reeking of money. How unfortunate. He's an oil in a big way. So, sardines. They're ever so rich, Dozens of oil wells you'd never believe. Well, I must say, he does sound quite interesting. They're coming over here for the season. Bring them down for the weekend. Splendid. Oh, don't look so miserable, Perry. Just think, with all that money, You'll be able to afford new equipment. I suppose that's one way of looking at it. I must say, this meeting has turned out Much better than I expected. One small thing. Don't worry about it, Randy, it's not your fault. It'll cost a lot of money to entertain the Durenecks. They're accustomed to the best of everything. Ah, then they must have it. Allow me to take the responsibility. I'm sure I speak for the staff. They're all behind you. - Oh, milord. - Oh! I suggest we all adjourn. So, brothers that is the situation and I took it upon myself to say that we would support the family in its hour of need. Why does he keep saying he's our brother? Well if he is, he better watch out for the law. Why? It's illegal. - What? - Incest. What's that? Something all the family can enjoy. Order, order! Had you a point to make, brother? No, brother, no, I agree with you. I'm sure the family will appreciate That we have rallied to the cause. Now we've all got good jobs here And I wouldn't want to lose my position. How many have you had, Mrs. B? 69. Ah, then you've got to face it. What? That you're on to a very comfortable wicket. Don't spoil it. So what do you want from us, Monsieur Hampton. Yes, what do you want from us, Mr. Hampton? Yes, well I thought if we all contributed one week's wages That should take care of the food. I shall make myself responsible for the liquid refreshment. Ah, well you've been doing that for long enough. Mellons, I shall rely on you to see to the game. Ah, now there's another thing, there I'n't any. What? He's shot it all, ha'n't he? Come on, Mellons, You're an ingenious fellow. Well stocked over at Brampton Hall. Here, are you telling him to go poaching? Yes. Can't we put the matter to a vote, Mr. Hampton? Certainly, Mrs. Burgess. All those in favour. Aye! Then it only remains for me to call the meeting to a close. I shall rely on you all to do your bit. I only wish we could be sure young Peregrine will do his. He don't know, does he? That thought had already occurred to us, Mellons. I understand her ladyship is taking the matter in hand. Ah, Perry, isn't it a lovely day today? The birds are singing, the bees are buzzing. Birds, bees, does that remind you of anything? Honey. - Darling. - Pardon? And spring and the sap rising and all that sort of thing. You know, it's at a time like this that a young man's fancy Turns lightly to thoughts of love. Have you ever thought about love, Perry? I don't go in for that sort of thing myself. Well then it's time you thought about life. I'm quite happy as I am, mater. How can you know about love until you try, dear boy. How do you know what goes on in woman's heart? Can you feel how it beats? 72 times a minute. Oh, Perry. Sometimes I really think you're too clever. I don't want to upset you, mater, honestly. Then try to understand how difficult it is For me to talk you like this. I mean, now that you're grown up, a man, really, Well we must speak about the facts of life. Oh, I've always been interested in nature. So have I. It's wonderful when you think that little bits of pollen get up to the stamen And send its seed through the pistol. Wonderful. Unless of course, you follow the Darwin theory. Oh, wasn't he the horrid little man Who said we were all descended from monkeys? That's right, do you remember when we all went to the zoo and we were laughing at the monkeys and pater made us turn away Because they were doing rude things. Perry, about those monkeys. Yes? Well, they weren't really being rude. They were making love. Everyone makes love at some time, Not just monkeys. And when a man and woman are in love What happens can be quite beautiful. Well I've heard sex isn't good for one. It isn't. But it's marvellous for two. Now put your arms around me, hold me very close. I'm-- I have this feeling I'm closer to you than you are to me. Silly boy, now kiss me. Oh, it's wonderful feeling so close together. Can you feel something pressing against me, pressing against you? No. - No? - Yes! Yes. The cork, that reminds me, I must put it in the retort. I can think of a choice retort myself. You stop that, you hear me, you take the liberty! You don't mind his Lordship giving you a cuddle. Well, he has more time and beside, it is his right. He is, how you say, a count. A what? A count. Oh yes, yeah. Oh, I have work to do. I thought you French girls were supposed to like it? I never said we didn't like it. Oh, good. Oh, Rogers, you beast. Oh, Rogers, oh. Oh, yes, mm. Oh there you are, Rogers, I've been looking for you. Oh yes, sir? Doing something special at this moment? Well-- I'm having a sort of a trouble Getting some crates up from the cellar. Run along and help us, good lad. Well, if I could just finish what I'm doing here, sir. It's Mimi, you see, I'm just giving her a little help shaking out the rugs. Ah, Mimi, yes. Well, I'll carry on with Mimi And you carry on with the crates. Oh, very well, sir. If you're sure. Definitely. Yes. Oh,, don't stop now. Don't stop. The way you're carrying on, You'll be all day cleaning one room. No rug can be that dusty. Aren't you gonna change over? No, this is a good way. Ah, housework can be so enjoyable. More, Stop it, that's enough. Oh, big garcon, oh, garcon, help! Excuse me, milord, there is a person waiting without. Without what? Oh, I do wish you'd finish your sentences, Hampton. Well, who is it? Snotty, milord. Oh,, oh can't you get rid of him, man. If I may advise, my Lord, I think we should see him, Circumstances being as they are. Oh, show him in. Oh, and Hampton? Yes, milord? Your best sherry. Yes, milord? Lock it up. And don't leave me too long with that big toad, I shan't be responsible for me actions. I shall serve the cooking sherry, naturally. But we should try not to get his back up just yet. All right, show him in. Oh, his Lordship will see you now. Oh, Shuttlecock, it's you, is it. G'day, your Lordship, It's very good of you to see me. Sit down, man, sit down. Makes me quite bilious bobbing about like that. He is, my Lord. Sit down, man. Oh, thank you, your Lordship, I am deeply honoured. Yes, aren't you? Well carry on man, carry on. Well I've been thinking about our little business matter. Yeah, not so little. Well, it depends how you look at it. I mean, there's no point in our fighting and carrying on. Oh, the more I think about you being thrown out of here with nowhere to go and me, living here in style, The more I thought it wouldn't do. Very sensible. Don't think you'd like it here. Wouldn't suit. Ah, now you've got it wrong. I live here but you needn't go. Well, I don't No, but we all live here. Together. Hampton! I do beg pardon, milord, Perhaps Mr. Shuttleworth would care to explain? I don't think I quite heard him right. Well, like I was saying, I am prepared to tear up the IOUs, your bills, your mortgages, And let things go on just as before. You are? Under certain conditions, of course. I'm sure Lord Cockshute Feels these sentiments do you credit. May we know what has induced this change of heart? Love. Love! I'm mad with it. I can't sleep at night for thinking of her. Just the thought of holding her in my arms. It's worth anything in the world, that is. So there you have it. We have? I can't screw me own family, can I? I mean, oh, in so many words, if you know what I mean. I can't say that I do. I'm trying to tell ya. You can have all this If I can have your Kitty. Kitty! Now, steady, milord, now lie down. Where are my turns, Hampton, - Now, breathe. - Get off me, Hampton. - Ow! - What's the matter? Perhaps you'd care to wait in the hall for a few minutes. Yes, please, yes thank you. Oh dear, what are we going to do? Things may not turn out so badly after all, milord. What? Well, play him along, humour the toad. 'Til we've got the American heiress in the bag. Ah yes, I suppose that doesn't work. And we may have to prevail upon Lady Kitty. Oh, I don't like it, Hampton. Never fancied her marrying a commoner And he's commoner than most. Look at the bright side, milord, invite him for the weekend and if all goes well with the heiress, we can kick him right-- Ah ha, karate! I've got a brown belt. I've seen it, milord. For your hernia. Ah, bring him in again, Hampton. Very well, milord. His Lordship has recovered, please come in. Now, as you were saying, Mr. Shuttleworth, oh, what were we saying? That you had no objection to Mr. Shuttleworth Asking for Miss. Kitty's hand. Well I can't answer for Lady Kitty, She'll have to make up her own mind about the-- Don't you worry on that score, your Lordship, Just leave the little lady to me. We have our ways and means. Well, I think this calls for a bit of a celebration, hey? Hampton. Yes, milord? Bring up a chair and sit down. Yes, milord. About the weekend, milord. I suppose as it's such short notice, Mr. Shuttleworth is already engaged. Oh, a little house party, would've asked dear old Snotty, but as you say, Hampton, pity he can't come. I can! I'm sure he would've enjoyed himself. I can! Would he have behaved himself in a decorous manner? Ah, what! Pity he can't come. I can! I can! He can. Oh, I wouldn't miss it for worlds. Oh, you can count on me. Oh, cheers. Oh, finished already? Well, I haven't had one yet. Oh good, needn't detain you any longer, then. Very busy, you understand, estate matters. Oh, yes, I'll see that, your Lordship. Well, I'm very much obliged. I'll just go and see Kitty, then. We'll get along perfect, you'll see. Hampton, my time will come. Of that, there is absolutely no doubt. With a little off for good conduct. Rogers! Oh, hello, milady. What strong arms you have, Rogers. Oh thank you, milady. I need 'em in my job. Of course you do. Tossing all that hay up into the loft. I believe that you could toss me up there if you wanted to. Well, I dare say I could. Shall we try? Not just now, milady. I've got a lot of work to do. You see, I've got a lot of work to do with these visitors arriving. Maybe tomorrow. Oh, fetlocks! Excuse me, milord. Oh. Oh, don't fuss, Randy. People are prepared to overlook all sorts of things these days Especially as Mr. Shuttleworth has so much money. Oh, bah! It may work out quite splendidly. With your influence, Couldn't you get him raised to a peer? I'd rather chuck him off one. Only problem I can see Is how to get Kitty to cooperate. Hampton. Hampton? Yes, he's the only one who can control her tantrums. I must confess, I can't stand another one Of her blasted paddies. He could pop up now. Yes, I'll tell him. Hampton. Milord? I've decided you should be the one to tell Lady Kitty About Snotty. Very well, milord. Send up a pot of tea, if you would, Hampton. Yes, milady. China? Of course. We pawned the silver one last month. Hampton. I always did say your timing was impeccable. You can help me off with my boots. Stairs, milady? I think so, Hampton. Is that a horn? Yeah, sounds as though Hampton's got Kitty to blow it. Good old Hampton. Here they come! Here they come! Quick, they're coming. No, no, no, girls, there's no time for that now, now line up. Polly, bit more. No, milord, no, not with the staff. Over here. Mimi, I think, bring yourself over here. That's right. Hello there. Gee, this is great. My, it's positively prehistoric. Good heavens, Daisy. Stay down. Thank you, my man. Mr and Mrs. Dureneck, how marvellous-- - Kitty. - Kitty. Come and meet my parents, mater, pater, Mr and Mrs. Dureneck. Your Earlship! Hi, Lord Cockshute. Coo, as in port. Oh no, it's a little early for me for alcohol. You can get up now, dear. Heidi, Heidi, leave. Lucerene and Betsy and Kitty, knickers! F.L. Dureneck at your service, ma'am. My, you have a mighty fine place, there. Yes, it was built by one of Randy's ancestors, the first earl. He was a great soldier. Pretty good bricklayer, too. You know, I have a feeling that you and I Are gonna get on very well together. Stay down 'til I tell you. Oh, thank you, you warship. You know, I can't tell you how excited I was When Betsy Ann showed me the letter from your Kitty. Imagine spending the whole weekend With a real live duke. Oh, we don't stand on ceremony here. I'm Randy. Oh, how lovely for your wife. This is my brother, Perry, He's been longing to meet you. I have? Yes, yes, I have. Are you coming in, Mr Dureneck? Oh, F.L. to you, your Lordship. Ha ha, not just for a little moment, though. Phew. Luggage. You've got all these breast plates here, then the armour, pike, sword. Yes. Oh, we've got everything here and I'd like you to meet the pillar of the household, our butler, Hampton. Hampton. Where the devil has he gone? Hampton, Hampton! Hampton, I want you to meet Mrs. Dureneck. What the devil's the matter, man? Is it your back? No. You! I say, do you two know each other? I think it would be more accurate To say that I know of madam, milord. I well remember her as Daisy Daydream. Daisy Daydream? The Daisy Daydream? Who used to do it at the gaiety? And anywhere else you can think of. Best all round lay in the chorus. What did you say? Those little roundelays you used to sing with the chorus. At the time, you enchanted me at the gallery. If you will excuse me, milord. Rogers, Polly, Vera, Maud, and Mimi, If you would see to the other guests. Yes, Mr. Hampton. I must talk to you. Ah, madam, if you will follow me, I will show you to your room. Oh! After all we'd been through together And after all we meant to each other. How you could walk out on me on the eve of our wedding. I don't know how you dare speak to me. I'm not, you're speaking to me. Oh! I've never been so humiliated in my whole life And in front of all the girls in the chorus. I'd even made me own wedding dress. Oh, how could you, Percy? Ah, such happy memories. They've kept me going all through these years. Eh? You didn't understand. We were very young But at least I came to my senses in time. You what? Dearest Daisy. You were worthy of greater things. I was just a struggling footman. I couldn't let you throw yourself away on me, I had to be strong. I made the supreme sacrifice. Percy! I took the Queen's shilling and went off with Gordon To fight the Dervishes. Oh, I didn't know you'd gone to war. Ah, yes. A bloody experience But it's better not to rake up old wounds. Oh, oh Percy. What are we going to do? Nothing. You may rely on my discretion at all times, madam. Madam? I've heard so much about America. I hear everything's so big there. Oh, you can say that again. Take Niagara Falls. Millions and millions of gallons of water Run over that every minute of every day. And I suppose all night too. How extravagant. Oh, there you both are. I've taken Betsy upstairs. That is a really beautiful daughter you have there, Cockshute. Yes, wonderful horsewoman, damn fine seat. I had noticed. Will you take a look at that view? Why can't my lawns look like that? You need good soil. Got the best. And good drainage. The finest in the whole United States of America. And the best Cumberland seed. That I used. Yes, then you've got to mow them for 600 years. Oh, oh yeah. Oh, I do like you people. I can't tell you what a thrill it is to be here. I feel I can relax for the first time with people like me, people of substance. Substance? Obviously. Oh, you do not know the trouble we have been in Since we've been in your little old country. Really? What trouble? Oh, fortune hunters, scroungers, every penniless good-for-nothing Dangling after my Betsy Ann. They don't have a hope. They haven't? Dear lady, Francis L. Dureneck Was not born yesterday. I can see that. Have no fear, I look after my little girl okay. Ha ha. Morning, Lady Kitty. Morning, Rogers. Come along, Snotty. Come along, Snotty! Lord, the man is impossible. Regular tearaway here, sir. Oh, that brute doesn't scare me. It's just a bit early in the morning For this sort of exercise. Well, you know Lady Kitty's habit sir. Has to be mounted by nine in the morning. Really? Side saddle, sir. Oh. I think you'd better give me a leg up. Yeah. Have we started? Get off my land. Next time you'll get both barrels. I can't get it to come off, Mrs. Burgess. The rust, I can't get it off. Oh, Lordship. Watch it. How many have you got? Three. Three, I'll have 'em. One, two... Go on, go on! Go on, get out of it. Get off. Get up. Cock pheasant, sir! Where? Good shot. I know. - And another. - Where? They're fighting back. Here, take my gun, sir. Right. There we are. And another. This one gave itself up. Ah, well done Mellons. Eh? They're falling like melons. Oh, follow me. Such a lovely garden. You know, I've travelled all over And I always say there's nothing to beat an English garden. Do you do a lot in it? Oh, I try to keep my end up. How wise. I had a most interesting chat With your husband last night. I always find holding a conversation with Randy Is really rather like trying to knit fog. And Peregrine, such a nice young man. Just the kind of boy That I've always wanted Betsy Ann to marry. The trouble with F.L. is that he thinks everybody And all her beaus are after his fortunes. He's well stacked, you know. And money, too. Oh, sorry. Don't apologise. I'm always telling him he's far too fat And how about that stomach. If that was on a woman, You'd think she was pregnant. It was and she is. Just think, all these are your ancestors. Yes, that's my grandfather. He fought with Wellington. Fancy! That was the trouble with grandfather, He couldn't get on with anyone. I've never been in a place as old as this. Are there any ghosts or things? Oh yes, there's Lady Esmerelda. Actually, this is where she haunts. Here? Oh, don't worry, She only comes out at night in the full moon. Do tell me about her. Well, it's rather sad, really. Her husband got back from the crusades and caught her being unfaithful. And he killed her in a jealous rage? No, he locked her in the room at the end of the corridor And put chains round her ankles. Goodness, how dreadful. Well, he let her out at night once a month to the nursery to see her little son while he was sleeping. Actually, they say you can hear her moans of grief Echoing all through the house. And that's at full moon? Why, I believe there's a full moon tonight, Peregrine. Is there? I don't go in for that sort of thing myself. Oh. Should we go and find the mothers? All right. Lady Cockshute's very pretty. I imagine lots of men find her attractive, how about you? I don't think they'd give me a second glance. Oh, Monsieur Hampton, you gave me the big fright. I should think so, too. And just what do you think you're up to? I was only playing. You must never play with the lady's baubles. But you do, Monsieur Hampton. That is beside the point. You will have to punish me, yes? Yes. Are you going to be hard on me? More than likely. Come here. Oh. How now we play more games, yes? Did your father spank you when you were a child? Oh yes, many times, he'd love to do this. I can understand it. I always remember my father saying, "Spare the rod "And spoil the fun." There, now don't be naughty again Or shall I have to repeat this performance. Promise? Get your clothes on, quickly. Oh. And you'd better take that thing off. I can't see any birds. One in there. I'll get him on the rye. Double barrel. Now, Lady Cockshute, Please leave everything to me. Don't you worry about the little romance. We can always get together and give him a show. I'm sure that's exactly what Perry needs. You'll never manage it From that position, Bishop. Well, I'm afraid I'm not very good At this sort of thing, my dear. Oh, no, no, Bishop, no. It's like this, you come round here. That's it. Oh! Bishop, it's too hard. I found the correct opening And then I lost control of the ball. Look who's playing with the Bishop. It's that young actress, Christabelle St. Clair. Oh yes. Pretty little thing. Reminds me of myself when I was on the stage. She's a big hit in that new musical. She had an enormous hand at her opening. Night? Of course. Oh look, there's Lady Bottomley. Who's she with? Some count. Oh dear, did I hit your balls then, Bishop? Oh... Thought everyone, You Count Von Schilling, sterling character. Just like an Englishman, really. I think that Lady Bottomley Means that as a compliment, yeah? Oh, Bishop, you are a one. Oh, goodness me, Have you lost it all together? Oh bother me, I've got a thorn in my finger. Oh, that could be dangerous, Come along with me. Where are you two going? I'm just going to take a thorn Out of the Bishop's finger. He really has a nasty prick. A good day of sport, eh. Bagged four birds and lost the dog. Great. Tell me, does your son ever go shooting with you? Oh good lord, no, quite hopeless. Tried a shot in the air once and missed. Oh, what a shame. Good air too, makes you feel so healthy. A few days down here will make a new man of you. Yeah, and that'll make Daisy happy. How is your wife? Ah, better than nothing. Oh, I see what you mean? Oh, she's well, thank you for asking. Oh I say, there is a plump little pigeon. I wouldn't mind having a shot at that. Oh, and she's wearing my favourite colour. Thank you. Here, game for a little bet? Name it. I bet I have them off her within 10 minutes. Done, I'll lay a pony. There we go now, oh. Come on, Polly, come and get it, Come on girl, jump, jump. Yes, you're a big girl. You can fetch it, go on, Polly. A fair win, don't you agree? Your bird, sir. Ha ha, gee, thanks. I'm just going to amuse meself With a little bit of chicken. Join us later? Look out, Polly, here comes Francis. Five pound notes, Polly. Would you like to play a little paper chase game? Oh, I would, yes, Mr Dureneck. You got it. We'll hide one there, one there One there, one, no, two tucked in there. One here. One here And starting taking them, Polly. That's it. Oh, Mr. Dureneck. Is that another pond or rising damp? Here, if that Mr. Dureneck makes a grab for you, just watch it. Why? He's got more hands than an octopus. What have you been up to, then? Bit of hanky panky with the Yankee. Oh, you naughty girl. Haven't seen much you today, my dear. We were very busy, milord. Yes, I know, how about later? Yes, if you so wish. Yes, I'll come to your room when the others have gone to bed. Two o'clock, nice? Yes. Oh, Bishop, is it still throbbing, shall I kiss it better? Oh, oh, oh, You really are a very clever little actress. Better, yes? Considerably, yes. Oh there's gold in them thar hills ma'am And I have the prospective spirit. Is two o'clock in the morning A good time for that sort of thing, F.L.? Some of the best shafts have been sunk Just at that moment, ma'am. Then come to my room and stake your claim. That's two o'clock fixed. Now, anyone for 10-ish? Ma'am! I challenge you to a dance. Accepted. Do you want a drink? He's more canned than I am. So sad that one meets so few Germans with titles nowadays, Count Von Schilling. Yeah, they are disappearing one by one. Oh, what fun, Urigs! I can't believe it, so young, so beautiful. And you, a real Duchess. Well, I did marry Freddie, One of the oldest dukes I could find. That can keep you very busy. Why don't you and I Go for a little walk in the garden, Duchess. You should say, "Your Grace." For what we are about to receive. Kitty, dear, Who is that nice young man you were dancing with just now? Sir William Bag. Oh, is he a Bart? He was a Bart, a few minutes ago. How'd you like to sink your little teeth into my leg? Mm, this deviled crab's delicious. I really can't resist it although I know I shall pay for it later. Although I know I shall pay for it later. The shellfish disagrees with you, Bishop? I'm afraid so, yes. Me too. I'm having the chicken. Oh, really? I just love the parson's nose. Hi there, Bish'. Gotta hand it to Randy, He's certainly put on a swell party. Yes, he's a grand chap. I've known him for ages, actually. He used to be my fag at Eton. Is that so? Your fag? I do admire the British, They're so outspoken. I'm not very good at parties. I get shy with so many people. Me too. You know what I'd really like to do? What? Show you my laboratory. Well? I've had to lock it up for the weekend. Pater said it would bore you. Oh, but it wouldn't. I'd love to see it. Well, perhaps we could. They'd get very angry. Do we have to tell them? I suppose not. Look, after everyone's gone to bed, meet me in the hall And I'll take you down to the dungeon. It should be all clear about two o'clock. What an adventure. I'll pretend I got a headache And go to bed early. Right. I beg pardon, miss. Sorry, my fault. I thought perhaps a little refreshment. Oh no, no thank you, I don't want any, really. I don't feel very well. You didn't upset the young lady, your Lordship? Of course not. Then you will be seeing her a little later on, perhaps? No, definitely not. You heard what she said, she's going to her room. I certainly will not see her again tonight. You do realise I'm the only groom here? I mean, you are an honoured guest. I mean, I don't wanna forget me place. If you do, you can always come up to mine. Oh, very well, madam. Just as long as you won't regret it. I may hate myself after But before and during, wowee! Madam's glass needs filling. And that's not all. Spoilsport. Carrying on with the groom, Daisy,. It's too much. Too much of a good thing is wonderful. You should behave yourself. Remember who you are now. I want a serious word with you. Oh? Later. Come to my room when everyone's gone to bed. Oh, I see. I mustn't carry on with the groom But it's all right with the butler. Okay. Here's to you, F.L. And to you, Cockshute. You folks have been so kind to me. I would like to apologise for the Boston Tea Party. Ah, marry me, Kitty, You'll have no more worries for the rest of your life. I don't think it would work. You know about nothing about handling big estates. Ah, just let me to grips with it. Ah, I think I'm developing an allergy to water. I think this calls for a counsel of war. I'll tell his Lordship. Will you take Lady Kitty to the orangery? Yes, come on. I don't care what it means, I can't stand him any longer. I can't even bear to talk to him. Don't blame you, my dear, obnoxious blighter. Oh but Kitty, you're our only chance. Oh, disaster. Don't despair, milord. I still have one ace up my sleeve. Now those diamonds that Mrs. Dureneck is wearing, 22 carat if I'm not mistaken. You're not suggesting that we should, well, are you? With all these wealthy guests, little burglary Might be just the thing. Of course, milady, some of your jewels would have to go to. But they're only copies. Exactly, but it will divert suspicion. Oh, Hampton, you're wonderful. Damn clever. Just one thing. Yes, milord? Never done a burglary before. How do we go about it? I think Rogers is our best bet. He must go into Mrs. Dureneck's room And pinch the jewels. And then into me for mine? Capital! Well, that's all settled, then. No, wait. We must have a signal So that we know when the deed is done. Good idea, milady. Timing is essential. I suggest that Rogers steals the jewels before two o'clock. Your job, Lady Kitty is to see that he's out of your room By a quarter to two. That will give him 15 minutes to steal Mrs. Dureneck's diamonds And milady's trinkets. Then, when we hear the grandfather clock striking two, we will know that all is clear And the deed has been done. It's been lovely talking to you about old times, Percy but I better go. It's early yet. Oh, but I'm taking a risk as it is. I mean, supposing Francis were to wake up And wander into my room. One for "Auld Lang Syne." ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪ Ah, you know, you're still a very attractive woman, Daisy. The years have treated you lightly. Well, you haven't done so badly yourself, Perce. Darling Daisy. Ah, do you remember the days when I used to call for you at the stage door And walk you back through the park? How we used to cuddle on the park bench? It's more comfortable now though, ain't it? Ah, but in those days when we were young, Who cared about hard benches and cold nights? We had each other, Daisy. Talking about it all makes it seem just like yesterday. Funny to think it's 19 years. 19 years, is it really? 19 year. Must be. Betsy Ann has a birthday coming up, I believe. 19, she tells me. Percy! Ah, so she is my daughter. Oh! And all these years, You've been passing her off on old Dureneck. Well what else could I do? I mean, oh, oh! You wouldn't tell Francis, would you? You couldn't. Calm down, Daisy, calm down. I only want what's best for the child. Our child. It's past quarter to two. You've got work to do. Oh, just five more minutes, milady. You must concentrate on the job in hand. There'll be plenty of time for that later. You make it very difficult, your Ladyship. Now don't forget the signal. When the clock strikes two, We all know you got the diamonds safely. I'm hardly likely to forget that, milady. I want you to know that we're very grateful For what you're doing, Rogers. I'll see that you are amply rewarded. Oh thank you, milady. I'll remember that when I'm hard up. Whoa! So will I. Up, up, and away we come. Don't you mean away we go? Nein. Come along, Daisy, it's getting late. Time we were both in bed. Oh! Alone, you're tired and overwrought. A good night's sleep will work wonders-- - But-- - Good night. Oh, God blimey. I mean, goodness. Yes, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know you were there. Well, I had this ghastly dream, you see And I woke up and I just didn't know where I was. I must have been sleep walking. I say, terrible experience. Don't sleep too well myself, you know. I quite understand. Can I show you to your room? Oh, thank you, your Earlship. Good evening, Archie, Nice night for a stroll? Hello, old chap. Good evening, madam. Not on pleasure bent I fear. No? A slight stomach disorder. It's my own fault. I never could resist your cook's concoctions. Excuse me. By the way, Randolph, You better get that clock of yours checked. It stopped. I've just managed to get it started again. Thank you, Archie. Never say die. I didn't. What lovely Plymouths. Plymouths? Rhyming slang, Plymouth Hoes, bosoms. Oh, your Lordship. Isn't it a little bit public out here? Why don't we go into my room? Oh God, no! I didn't mean it like that, dear lady. What did you mean? Come into mine. Much nicer, lovely view of the lake. Ah. Kitty. Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty! Rogers, I've been waiting for you. Oh, I'm sorry, your Ladyship. Where are your jewels? Guess. Oh, that's the first place a thief would look. Getting warmer. Who's a clever boy, then? Thank you, your Ladyship. You better help me off with this clasp. Oh, do hurry, your Ladyship. It's like Epsom Racecourse out there With everybody running up and down. Kitty, Kitty? Oh, Kitty, I can't go on like this. Put me out of my misery, you tantalising creature. Say you'll marry me. Will ya? Yes? Beauty! That's just how I feel. Rat tat tat tat. I've come for a night cap, my dear. On second thoughts, for the performance I intend, They should give me a knighthood. Tell me, do you like playing around Before or after making love? Yes. You're a genius, Perry, you really are. I wouldn't go so far as that. No, really. It's brilliant. Papa would be really fascinated by all this. He's mad about gadgets. May I bring him down here tomorrow? Well, if you think he'd like it. Oh, yes he would. Papa's always... Oh my goodness, papa! Listen, thank you very much for showing me your secret But I think I'd better be going now. Thank you. I've never met anyone like you before. So understanding, so-- - Yes? - Wonderful. Oh. Goodnight. Esmerelda. Sounds as if the guests are enjoying themselves. I say, have I hurt you? Don't kid yourself, Randy, it's not me screaming. Me either. Oh. My wife! Goodnight my dear. See you later, with luck. Hey, what the hell? What are you doing in there? Isn't that your girl lying there? Daisy, follow the chain. Do something F.L., do something. Oh, what the hell's going on? I've done nothing, nothing. That's a bit strong, isn't it? I know every Bishop has to have his sea but this is going too far. And after all, the girl is a guest in me house, you know. Yes, yes, but you surely-- Ah, you've gone too far this time. You surely can't think that I, Oh, the poor young lady. Oh, my dear young lady. Are you all right? Oh dear, I'm so very sorry. Kitty, what's that? What's that strange ghoulies? Perry? Thief, murder, rape! Can you make your mind up? Who's screaming? Rape? I insist on rape. No way, not on your nelly. You better get out, get out the back way. Right you are, milady. Rape, rape I say. Thief, murder, rape, murder, thief. My dear lady I-- There's a thief in my room. Hello again. Oh lord, what a fracas. Send for the police immediately. A thief? What on earth would a thief want here? Jewels, Randy, don't be silly. Perhaps it would be a good idea if everyone checked their rooms to see if anything is missing. What a good idea, Hampton. Come on, Daisy. Yes. Tried to wrench the rings off me finger, Woke me up he was so violent. Rogers must have taken leave of his senses. Lady Bottomley, if I may search your room. Oh, no need, knocked him out cold. He can't have escaped, must be here somewhere. Close the window. My diamonds are missing! And my rings, too. Good gracious, excuse me, milady. With your Lordship's permission, I think we should send for the constable. I mean, we can't have you bashing the Bishop, my dear. Perhaps you should go to bed. Oh no, I couldn't possibly sleep, not after all that. Come on, Perry let's show papa your new invention. May I suggest that we all go downstairs-- There's a good idea, Hampton. I think it's much better if F.L. goes down To see Perry's invention alone. The dungeon is so cold. Just don't distress yourself. Oh, let's have a drink. Yes, I could use a good stiff one. I think I can provide that, madam. Oh, well done, my boy. Make it eh, the bed? Well don't let me disturb you, You deserve a rest after your hard labours. Oh, very well milord. As matter of fact, I was looking for you. Really? Yes, to deliver this. I say, well done my boy, well done. Oh, thank you, sir. Better give this to Hampton straightaway. He was wondering where you were. Was he? Yes, thought you'd gone down, actually. I was just about to. Excellent, excellent, Well let's go and find Hampton, then. You've done a darn good job there, Rogers. Come along. Oh,. Yes, very clever my boy, very clever But I don't know what to make of it. Well, I thought of covers for plants. Mater has such trouble. No, no, you must get something to grab the imagination. Oh, you'll think of something, papa, you always do. Yeah, sorry to disappoint you, honey but you see, I don't know what one can with this, this... Let me out, let me out of here-- Great suffering catfish. Ah, found him. Oh yes, I'd know that criminal face anywhere. Oh, you Blaggard. Why, it's Snotty. Where's Rogers? He's here with me. He's got the jewels. Let me get at him, you rapist. I'll have ya. Not here, milord. Take that and that. Great this stuff, I didn't realise it would stretch that far. Oh, there's no limit. Strong, too. You can't escape. Yes, this rubber can take any amount of pressure. Interesting. Wet inside yet dry outside. Let me get at you. Sit still. Stop that! You can feel through it, too. Of course, it's so thin, You can hardly notice it. Great. Great! You filthy beast. I'll have you. I've got it. We are gonna make our fortune. Dureneck, our name is going to be on everybody's lips. My boy, you and I have a lot to talk about. Oh, papa! Perry, oh, lovely. Okay, what's the deal? Well, I haven't really thought about it yet. His young Lordship is too modest. We have given a certain amount of consideration to the subject, haven't we, milord? Anything you say, Hampton. Shall we say 100,000 pounds down And 50% of the profits? I say, Hampton, do you think we can afford-- Done, and none of your putting up the prices, a deal is a deal. Ah, how does it feel to be a rich man? I don't really know yet. A boy after my own heart, You're going to be a self-made man. I too am a self-made man, so was my father. When he started, he started with just his bare hands. And three or 400 slaves. Evening all. Ah, good evenin', young Harbottle. Come in. - Evenin', milord. Having a spot of bother, I understand? We've had a robbery And we believe we may have apprehended the thief. Ah, guilt written all over his face. And what might your name be? Balderdash! Use an alias, are we, Mr. Shuttleworth? You can't fool me. I'm looking for his weapon. We knew you'd want to search him straightaway so we kept him here. Very wise, Mr. Hampton, very wise. He hasn't got one. Yes, always suspected that, Hampton. Voice didn't break 'til he was 20. I remember, milord, yeah. Come on, Lady Bottomley, if you please, madam. Now, upstairs, Mr. Shuttleworth. Up you go sir, up you go. Come on, sir, up, oh. Madam. You rapist, rape! The jewels, the jewels! Oh, the jewels. Most appalling privations. I'm just a simple lad come up from Down Under. Ah, hello? Caught red-handed. I didn't put them there, somebody else did. Who on earth would do a thing like that? The guy's trying to wriggle out of it. You'd better come along with me, sir. You'll have plenty of chance to make a statement Down at the station. That's right, there we go. You'll regret this. All of you. That's enough, Balderdash, I mean Shuttleworth. It's outrageous. I'm at a loss for words. To abuse my hospitality like this. Go and never darken me doorstep again. It won't be your doorstep much longer. I'll have the lot of you out of here by the end of the month. I think not. I shall send you my cheque tomorrow. I insist on escorting him to his cell in person. Come. Help. Pater, couldn't I send him the cheque? That's the one I'm talking about, lad. Peregrine, my boy, I really like you. Oh, if only Betsy Ann had been a boy, You always wanted a son. Perhaps he could have the next best thing. What's that? A son-in-law. Yes, a son-in-law. A son-in-law, oh Perry, darling. I know we're all gonna get on just fine together. Already I feel so much closer to you. Oh thank you, mater-in-law. Oh, Hampton, you're wonderful. Always my pleasure to serve. Hampton. Good morning. A beautiful day. The sun's int' sky, Lord Cockshute is in his bath And all's well with the world. Mm, breakfast. I really feel like it this morning.
