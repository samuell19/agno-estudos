Can I take the sword? Yeah take it! Cool. You should take the silver one, it's more powerful. This village is the same as earlier, isn't it? It's the first village, you'll see Jolhane. It pisses me off! The purse should be here. What purse? The purse full of golden coins. I want to buy a sword. Oh that one. It doesn't matter. You can reach the next level without it, anyway. How? Back to the village, you kill the farmer, and kidnap his wife. She's like a princess but poorer. Ok, but this won't help me buy the sword I'll need later. Well it will. Look, you take her hostage... Do it. Then you ranson the lord. What if he doesn't want to have her back? He always want to. The game's made this way. If I was the lord, I wouldn't pay. I'd keep my money to buy a sword. Watch out! On your right! Jolhane, seriously! Today my birthday! How long are you going to play? Only two hours. But everybody will be gone. I don't care! Do you hear that?! They want to keep playing for two more hours. And us, what are we suppose to do? I don't know. Just do your own stuff. Go dress your Barbies and dumb dolls. Lena!! I don't want you to play with us, anyway! Do your things and leave us alone. Go now! I won't go! Yes, you will! I'll tell Mom! Good bye! Bye! Watch out! Watch out! He's kicking again, passing to Kazer, who managed to turn around... Oh finally! Oh... These dummies are not going to... A clear loss of energy in the French ranks... Yeah! They're too careful... They're gonna get eaten alive! What's going on with you? It's because of the boys... They don't want to play with us. They're playing medieval video games. But we want to play for real! What does that mean play medieval games for real? Well... if we're right, we're princesses but we have no power so we always get kidnapped by knights then sold to other knights who decide... May be... we should be witches chased by priest because we're son of evil demons. What's all this about? How about you girls sit down? He's doing it again... First, I will switch off this massacre. Good. You know, women in the Middle-Ages were nothing like you may think. They were powerful, almost as powerful as men, sometimes even more. Dad! What are you talking about? Well, it's the truth. Women were allowed to do the same things as men. They were doctors, philosophers, writers or masters. But I've never learned all this! Ok, let's keep calm. Where is it? Where did I put this mysterious book? Yes, here is it! Well. I leave you with my daughter's education. Each time I hold the book into my hands, I am 10 again. How are my girls? What's that book? It's a son of reverie in which you meet super powerful girls who lived in the Middle-Ages. Would you like to take a look at it with me? - We had planned to... play, so... - Yes, yes! - We had planned to go out and play so... - Yes, yes! I've heard yes, so please, close your eyes! We will go back to the origins. Really far. This house didn't exist nor any other one around. The freeway that goes to the shopping mall didn't exist either. No concrete, no cars, nothing like this. We went back in time. You can still find houses, churches and villages. But they are very small compared to mountains and forests. Imagine that this book is a time machine. You know, as opposed to what you think, time is not a straight line. It's rather wave or circle-like. Things are born, they die and they are born again, just like flowers. It's a cycle, like winter or spring. History does the same thing. So we will start with a particular ending period: the end of the Roman Empire. We're in Gaul and it's awful for women. At that time, women had absolutely no rights. Except the right to lick men's boots. You were considered underage your whole life. You where almost treated as objects. Leana Catelinus, you are tried in this day, the fifth of September, in this year of our Lord 17 for an extramarital relationship which occurred on Saturday night, with another man than your husband. Besides, he was a comedian. Adultery is punished by immediate death. You'll be lapidated. Lapi what? Caillus Villus, since you have all the power over your wife, do you have anything to say regarding her execution? You Honor, I gave it some thought and I am wondering if it is the right punishment. I think I'd rather have her quartered. Actually, you should have told us earlier and we don't have the equipment. It's usually stoning. It's quick and it has the advantage of being very democratic. Indeed, anyone can take part. Stoning it is! Ouch, ouch ouch... Ouch! Indeed, life in the Roman Empire was not a Garden of Eden. The Romans were definitely macho men! However, a character is about to change the face of the world and above all to disrupt this brutal era. Nothing will ever be the same again. Look... This is three centuries later among the Francs. The law is less strict. Irmingarde, you are tried in this day, the fifth of September, in this year of our Lord 417, for an extramarital relationship which occurred on Saturday night, last week, with another man than your husband. Besides, he was a recluse living in the woods I admit but it happened only once. Adultery is punished by immediate death. You'll be quartered. I don't think so! Shut up! You're a fool. Your Honor, you obviously made an immense effort for this execution. How many horses do we have to quarter my wife? I am Jesus Christ your savior and God rules through me. Woman, you have sinned but I won't cast a stone at you. You, you must have sinned too and since everyone is equal in the Kingdom of God my heavenly Father. Anyone can be pardoned men and women; children and slaves. Who is he? This is the Resurrected Christ. He is the eternal light. Well you'll see that eternity can be far shorter than you think. For most people, taking Jesus seriously was not that easy. But repetition makes perfection. I am Jesus Christ your savior and God rules through me. Woman, you have sinned but I won't cast a stone at you. You, you must have sinned too and since everyone is equal in the Kingdom of God my heavenly Father. Anyone can be pardoned men and women; children and slaves. How did you manage to take off the necklaces? I am Jesus! You're incredible! Jesus, you are right. This woman must remain free. Besides, in the village everybody knows that Childeberg is a womanizer and that he cheated many times. Your Honor is a traitor. Go to hell. I have cheated and then refusing to admit it, I have gone further and I have killed. Lord, he's sinned really bad! But he deserves pardon, right? Do not worry Irmingarde. He will be pardoned in the Kingdom of Heaven. No, not this way! That way! Good, go ahead! This new Christian era could be described as a little more gentle. That didn't hurt! CHAPTER 1 THE LEGEND OF EUPHROSINE Jesus declared many revolutionary things but those who passed on his word were not as bold as he was. They were called theologians. Priests were no fun. They were austere and Cyril of Alexandria wasn't different. Look he is going with his mule to the Council of Ephesus. It was held in AD. 431, if I'm not mistaken. A council is a large assembly of priests who gather to conduct discussions about God. Cyril came from Egypt. He walked through the entire Byzantine Empire to reveal to the world that Jesus was not like anyone else. Indeed, he is both a man and a God. He's God's son. In theory, women were left out of this but we're going to take a closer look. This is where his Excellency will stay until the great Council and where he will be able to study. We have the largest library in Asia. His Excellency will thus excel at his excellent task. Even though, he's already excellent. Certainly, but for now, I'm very hungry. What are the region's delicacies? We'll have anything you desire: the best fruits, best meat, best cheese... I'll take a mix of those. Of course your Excellency. Euphrosine? Yes Sir Nikolos, how can I help? Bring us dinner, will you? His Excellency Cyril of Alexandria is hungry. Yes Sir. How about cutlets and plums purée. It's fine but his Excellency demands a mix of everything that we have. All meats: lamb but also mutton, veal, beef and pork. Also, wild boar, pheasant, chicken and goat. My God. It will be extremely difficult to find all of them. Difficult but not impossible. And you already have some lamb. How about fruits? Should I do a mix as well? Exactly. Bring us some dates as well as walnuts, pomegranates, figs... I got it, thank you. And I already have some plumps, I know. Exactly. Very good morning to you, your Excellency. After such a feast, did you sleep well, your Excellency? Really well. Also his Excellency got back to work to be well prepared for tomorrow's Council. Excellent. My dear Nikolos. I've heard that you have the best beekeepers in Asia. It's true. I've wanted to try your lotus honey for years. Would it be possible to get some to add to my yoghurt"? Of course. Euphrosine! Where has she been? Yes my Lord? You look tired. A little but I'm good. Well, his Excellency Cyril would like some lotus honey with his excellent breakfast. Can you get some? Um... Well... It's all gone. Last time I saw some was at the Emperor's wedding, ten years ago. We have to import it from Persia, so... His Excellency will show some leniency. I don't want to make this poor maid crazy. I'll do without lotus honey this morning. Okay, but when will you need it, then? Let's say this afternoon. You have to be humble before the Creator. This afternoon?! You've heard his Excellency! You should be able to find a jar or two. You'll be fine. Lotus honey for this afternoon, seriously? Don't ask me back. You'll find some. It is required by his Excellency. If you can't find it, you'll be fired. Do not worry your Excellency. Maids these days... Oh Lord! It possible that men who are that faithful are that harsh with me. Oh my Lord, thank you. Nikolos! What's wrong your Excellency? The situation is serious. I've just found back some texts and I've discovered something essential, something that we had missed before. This is great. Your Excellency always has the talent to disclose new pieces of knowledge. Nikolos, you agree with me... Tomorrow, I will announce to the whole world, that Jesus was not a simple flesh and blood prophet but definitely God. Who appeared personified as a man. That's right. Not only that, but something is missing, that's the problem. What is it? Nikolos... If Jesus is God, Mary who is Jesus' mother is thus God's mother. Oh my god! I know. Oh, Princess Calia! I remember that she had stuffed herself with honey. It's almost her fault if it's all gone. So we have God the Father, the almighty Creator. That's right. Then, we logically have our Lord, God the Son. Of course. How about the third blank? That's actually my point. We've been wondering about how to fill this third blank for centuries. This is the whole issue of the Holy Spirit. Who is it? I got the answer. Indeed, we have HE, the Father; the Son and SHE, the Holy Spirit. His Excellency is so excellent that he succeeded in solving the issue of the Holy Spirit. No his Excellency is an idiot and is ashamed of having failed to solve this earlier. The Gospel indeed states that Mary received the eternal grace of the Holy Spirit from Gabriel. Ashamed? You have no idea how big was our mistake. If us, men, we model ourselves after Jesus then, women model themselves after Mary. And since Mary is the Mother of God, full of grace, the way we treat women is totally absurd. Nikolos?! His Excellency? We messed up big time! Staffing today, you will treat women as equals, not as subordinates. Sirs, I've found lotus honey! Bow down before this damsel full of grace. Yes, your Excellence. Holy Euphrosine, how could we be that wrong. Like the lotus nectar, you are the purest embodiment of God's beauty and grace. You are excellent. CHAPTER II THE DEMI-GODNESSES This is Clovis. He's a barbarian and he's trying to invade Gaul... And he's not the type to do it half way. He's a well respected warrior. However, he lives for fighting to the point that he may lose his mind... Hopefully, he fell in love with another barbarian but a little more civilized. He married Princess Clotilde and it was high time that she intervened to counterbalance his warmongering hyperactivity... Probably conditioned by his job. As any good loving wife she decided to help him. Clovis? Clovis. Your Gods are nothing but stone idols, charms and common spirits. They are just good at giving you strength aggressive enough to fight. And fight again to the point that you don't even know why. The only God to worship is the one who created the earth, the sky and the sea from nothing. It is the principle of all things. It is the breath of the universe. The power that has always been and that will be for eternity. It enlightens the stars, makes fruits grow from the branch of a tree. And it makes your lips naturally find the softness of mine. Clovis, you must be baptized. I didn't understand every words you said but you're so beautiful that I'll do anything you want me to. Well, well, Reims' church is not like it used to be. They could have swept away the dust! Everybody's ready? Let's go! Santi! Be careful with the conjugation. Amen. What's that? The feminine Holy Spirit, I guess. Clotilde has sent her husband to be given a cold shower! Ah! That's how France was born. It corresponds to the beginning of the Middle-Ages and it will last for a thousand years. But I have to warn you that people in the Middle-Ages were obsessed by Christ and Virgin Mary. Their entire life revolved around them... Clodomir, Eulalie! "Virgin Mary here, Virgin Mary there" the Holy Woman figure is everywhere to the point that girls were gaining privileges that were even denied to boys. Clodomir, Eulalie, my dear children. Today, you're turning twelve. You know that I carried you both in my belly together. Well, today, one of you will become an adult. I wrote a little piece of poetry for the occasion: “The night has shrouded the woos and the fields. "The sun shines and warms up the water in which tardpoles' legs are growing..." Flowers are blooming in thousand of different colors... I'm really sorry. "My dear daughter, today's the day when you become a woman..." What I can say is that I understand Latin... And it says nothing about knights or horsemen. It's about blooming flowers. Eulalie, my dear girl, today you are an adult. By God's grace who makes women bloom faster than men. You are now allowed to get married, to chose an occupation and to get educated by our sisters. What?! Well, yes, Clodomir, my dear son. In two years, you'll be fourteen and you'll become an adult and may be a horseman. So please stop whining and go home! Pfff... It's unfair! You're mean. Hooray! I'm an adult! Yippee! It feels good to be free! Come on! Where are you going? I'm going to Rome, to Saint Peter's Holy See. But you're exhausted and sick, aren't you? God will give me grace on the way. Actually, I'm the grace of God and I am going to take care of you. Sit down, I'll bring you some soup. Hey Eulalie, it's so funny, we had the same idea. Let's move all of them in here. It will be more convenient. It's interesting, it looks like a hostel. Yes but a hostel built with God's grace. We should call it “Hostel of God... I agree. It would be a good idea to have them pretty much everywhere, like on the side of the roads that are taken by pilgrims. Indeed, in the early Middle-Ages, girls invented public and free hospital. At first, they would use what was available but they were determined to have gigantic edifices build. They would run and manage these places with an iron hand. Don't you think that it stinks old boar in here these days? It's awful. Yeah! I thought the smell was coming from my goat but actually it's not. It wouldn't be possible, we wash it everyday. It couldn't be your goat. We clean, we take out the excrements. Hey, you! Yes, gentlewoman? You smell like old boar. When was the last time you took a bath in the river? Dear gentlewoman, it was a month ago. I remember it clearly. How come? Was the water that purifying? I don't know, I just remember because I fell into the water. While I was fishing. You guys! Yes, gentlewoman? Be honest with me. Are you masons? Yes ma'am, we are Freemasons and we have build this abbey with our own hands. Okay, well, build us three bath in the abbey. I am an apothecary. Pour clear water from the river into them and add iris petals as well as roses, carnations and Fleur-de-Iis to the water. By obeying us, you obey God. As you wish gentlewoman. In the Middle-Ages, people had become really clean, almost like today. But, later in the Renaissance period, it was a disaster. People stopped washing and hid bad smell with fragrances. Dirty people! Ladies and Gentlemen, come, come closer; Don't be afraid. Come on, come. Listen to the magnificent astronomer that I am. It's very simple. If the sun rises, shines and sets it's because like the tree swallow that come each spring and help us getting rid of mosquitoes the sun travels everyday from East to West and turns the wheat yellow. The sun is the most faithful and the most constant of all shooting stars. And look at this stone. Wait. I haven't said anything, yet. As you can see, it's very simple, if the stone falls, it's because as Aristotle had demonstrated any objects moves by itself. The stone meet the earth such as the bird meet the sky. Now you can applaud. It's not true. If an arrow goes through the bird, it will fall and rot into the earth. Any solid being is attracted to the ground by a force that only God knows because he's sky-high. As for the sun, it is God's light and it was there before he earth even existed. It is the center of the universe. We are physical bodies floating around this celestial body. Hildegarde of Bingen was an amazing physician and she was also a theologian, a musician and a poet. She had figured out the law of universal gravitation by herself five centuries before Newton. Also, in cities and villages, women were very committed to science and education. Have a sit, boys. And in schools, noble kids got new classmates. This year is a little special. You will have new classmates. Cool! From what fiefdom are they coming from? Ours, of course! Here, he's coming. Let me introduce to you Claude. He's the son of one of our most hardworking farmers. But Miss, it's impossible. We can't have the same lessons as this pauper. That's enough. Here comes Theodora. Come in my dear. Theodora, what are you doing here? You should be home, reciting your prayers with your nanny?! No, this year I've decided to follow Sister Marguerite's lectures. Ok quiet. Today, we'll start with theology. My apologies Holy Sister, I walk barefoot. This is why I'm late. And Violet, my cow, is a little slow. She's twenty already. It's fine. Come in. Get a sit. It must have been a huge change. Ah ah! Shame on you! Shh! Who wants to do some theology? - I do! I do! - Me too, please! Okay, Archibald, what can you say about this apple? Hmm... I don't know. I love apples... My grand-mother makes great apple pies. This isn't worth more than 2 out of 20. It's useless. Give the apple to the young country girl, next to you. From the seed to the tree, from the tree to the fruit, from the fruit to the seed it is an eternal succession. Each fruit is both creature and creator. Each apple points toward Christ. This is really good. It's worth 17 out of 20. This is nonsense. It's going to far. Please, don't tell me that this peasant will stay with us. - Come on Archibald, let's go. - Definitely! What's the point of being the son of a knight if I have to share school with peasants and girls? Women were making sure that there were coeducational and free schools everywhere. Do you remember Adam and Eve? In this story, the woman is guilty of men's fall, because she tasted the forbidden fruit. While she had been charmed by a snake. Thus, for a long time, it was hard to trust them. But thanks to courtly love, all this faded away. The rules were as follows: in the relationship between the courtier and the courted, Women were Superior. They could be married or a virgin or widow and they dictated the way to court them. Lady Malisande, I wish that your grace will allow me to conquer your head and to abide by your discipline. Young Knight Gondebaud, let me take a closer look at the spirit that moves you. Tell me about your morning. I chased twelve brigands who were hunting too close from my walls. Why chase them? Did they commit any crime? No but they could. Or shall I say could have...? You act like an arrogant lion, without thinking. I want you to behave like the salmon. Tonight, you will travel the river upstream till you reach its source. And you'll find the origin of things. You'll figure out what evil forces push brigands to roam around your castle. And you'll destroy that evil. But my dear love, I can't swim and the river is so cold at night. At the time, it was considered inappropriate to work everyday. People thought that Nature would feel offended. Anyway, you had a day off every other day. Hisidérade, I am thinking about braiding my hair again. I would like a braid that ends in a rosette at the back of my head. I don't know. What do you think? Well... May be you should untie every other braids and weave your hair in one large braid at the back, with a fringe in the front. The Carolingian hairstyle is coming back into fashion. These days you must adopt a very minimalist style, you know. Perfection! This is perfection. Girls, it's giving me ideas. Hisiderade, look, it's Lontus. He looks so good. True! Did you told him to grow his hair? Yeah, he's so funny. He does everything I say. They didn't see it as a noble and fine ad but more as an immoral pastime that would distract honest men. Just that! Seriously... A lady could educate several men on the ad of love as long as discretion was respected. As for knights, they had found in women's beauty a direct reflection even though ephemeral of God's infinite and unchanging beauty. This is why they would obey. However, we have to mention that some women took advantage of their almost divine status and went a little too far that's the least we can say. Gondebaud, did you find the origin of evil? Yes my dear. When I put my feet in the cold water of the river, I realized that swimming back up like the salmon was actually a metaphor. And that I had to meditate and find the source in my own mind. I am very proud to see you going forward. What did you find out? Melisande, if brigands are brigands and roam where they roam it's because charity is not respected enough in this country. If it was, we would not have brigands in this kingdom, the same way that we do not have giraffes. I can see that grace is arising in your head and that it is getting closer to my own extended grace. And what did you do to restore charity in your own fiefdom? Madame, I ordered my freemasons to build an hospice that would be open to the forest and surrounded by fertile lands so that the brigands sustain themselves. Gondebaud, I think that you're ready for your ultimate mission the one that might gain you my heart and my bed. My dear, I can't resist anymore. Tell me that the task is not to hard to accomplish. Calm down my dear knight. I am talking about the cup in which Christ has drunk for his last supper and in which his blood was collected after a Roman spear pierced his side. Bring me the Holy Grail. If you succeed, you'll have my head and everything that come with it. You will receive immortality and you'll find the center of the universe. Indeed, the Grail is the source of all sources. To succeed, you must imitate the King of salmons. Oddly, after this period of courtly love that ended in the 13th century women were not allowed to practice metaphysics anymore. Bring back the Holy Grail was the ultimate quest for any knight. No matter rich or poor, with the most elegant horse or the smallest, he would go because he had taken an oath to his Lady. He had just started his quest that the worst scourges were already hitting the Kingdom. First, the Black Plague in the 14th century. It devastated the country. It was an horrible disease that killed almost everybody. Then, there was a war. A terrible war that lasted a hundred years, hence its name. And in the 15th century the Golden Age was over. CHAPTER III ME, THE KING CHARLES Here, we are at the Chateau de Chinon in the middle of the war. The young man that you see is the Dauphin Charles VII. He's a prince not yet a King. And right now, he's training a bit in order improve his defense of the Kingdom against the English even though he knows that it's a lost cause. Poor Prince, he looks so sad! I should talk to him. Your Highness, would you agree to a shod interview? Okay, it cannot be worse anyway. You seem worried, what's wrong? You want to know what's wrong! Well, let's try to figure out what's right! You won't find any answer, believe me. Really? Listen, my father died 7 years ago. He was completely mad. 9 years ago, my mother disinherited me from the throne and declared that the King of England was the heir. Now, people think that I'm not my father's son and that I don't deserve to be King. I told everyone that I was the King but nobody believed me... And today? The English are conquering my Kingdom: they owned Brittany, Normandy, île de France, Champagne, Guiana and the entire Burgundy which became one of its allies. Great! How am I going to do now? I'm alone and nobody believes in me. France will disappear, that's for sure. When you think, that the Dauphin usually is the eldest son and I am my parents' eleventh child. How is this possible? Well, all my brothers died. I told you everything. Your Highness, a woman who says that she was sent by God wants to see you. You see, more troubles! I bet that it's probably a witch send by the English to make me crazy. They are perfidious, I hate them. Anyway, I am sorry it's not that I'm not delighted by your company but I have bigger fish to fry. I gotta go. Everybody's ready? Have her come in! Hmm wait! Just a small precaution. Hugues, my faithful horseman, would you like to switch clothes with me? Why? I have a doubt. What if she tried to stab me. No, I don't think so. It's possible. Hurry, give me your boots! Oh please don't pretend to be offended, I know you. You say: “Have her come in... Have her come in. Joan the Maid of Orleans. Dear Prince, the king of Heav... Dear Prince, the King of Heaven requires that you'd be crowned King of France with my help. But he also requires me to help you chase the English out of France. How did you recognize me? Women's intuition. Women's intuition? It's too complicated for me! You're damn good! Well, you know, it was quite simple, your clothes are too big for you. So please, I am begging you to give me an armor and the title of war chief. Well... It cannot be worse anyway.! Give her an armor and a flag! This air will clear my mind. Let's hold a small war council. A war council, again! But we had one this morning. With all due respect it's not the right time. Now, we should synchronize our attack with Joan's in order to hit our enemy hard. Let's see... Joan left toward the Eastern front, which is smart. However, attacking westward seems dangerous. But Sir, war is dangerous! Yes, you're right it's always a little dangerous. But in this case, it's super dangerous. We should rather attack through the North. You want to cross the Loire? Moreover, almost all English troops are stationed on the Northern Front. This would be super dangerous! Ok wait, let me think... Can you hear this? It's a wood thrush. ' And here is a fetish“. . It's pretty rare in this season. My Lord, please don't be mad at me for saying this, but... But? My Lord, I think that you're scared. Of course not! I'm not scared. I'm just careful, that's all. Okay, well, let's attack westward as Joan said. We have to hurry if we want her plan to be a success. His trip in the woods seriously delayed us. Calm down, we'll reach the western gate. Long live the Maid of Orleans, long live Joan, long live the Dauphin!!! Thank you but what for? With her soldiers, Joan is chasing the English from Orleans. And on top of this she's giving us bread. She's so nice! Bow before your King! Charles VII belonged to this new generation of Kings who were suspicious of women. But look at what Joan will manage to make him do thanks to her superhuman determination. This is a historical episode that everybody forgot about. Charles, since you agreed that I was send by the King of Heaven, will you give me anything I want? Okay. Good. I want your Kingdom. Oh... my Kingdom? Giving you my Kingdom... Fine, I'll give it to you. Good. Get a clerk. He will write everything down so that everybody knows that you're giving me your Kingdom. Okay, Clerk please? Yes, your Highness, how can I help you? Write down the following thing: "I Charles VII of France give up my Kingdom to Joan the Maid of Orleans." But your Highness, are you crazy? What do you think? That you're not. Exactly, so write! We have before us the poorest King in the world. He has nothing left. Absolutely! Stop this! Is it a farce or what? Of course not my dear Dauphin. Listen, now that I am Queen of France, I give up my Kingdom to Jesus. Okay so now, Jesus is King of France? That's right. I don't get it. Jesus, who is now King of France is whispering in my ear that he gave it some thought and wants to give France back to Charles. - Phew! - What?! So... What was the point in all this? The point was to show you that even though you're the King you're nothing but a servant, a servant of Heaven. Oh my! Here behind that wall, it's Paris. The largest city in the Kingdom, still held by the English. I will attack through the Southern gate, you'll take the western one and we'll meet inside. Why does she always ask us to attack westward. It would be nice to have different plans from time to time. It's boring. Your Highness, please. Don't do it again, we won't go back to the woods and listen to the birds! Calm down, we will go to the western gate. It's high time to go now. Did you see the knight? He looks frightening. Sirs, get ready for the parade! This time, this really is war. Did you see, I managed to take hold of an English horse. But wait a minute, you haven't come inside Paris yet? I'm having doubts about you. Well, we were almost there. Did you come to tell us that you have chased the English out of Paris? Unfortunately, no. This time it won't be as easy as in Orleans. Today, the English are really powerful. I have lost all my men. They've been either captured or wounded. I am on my own. It's the Berezina! But we have to continue until exhaustion. Berezina! So we should retreat. My Lord is right. How about the King of Heaven? Why is he not with us today? My friends, God is not an old man with a magic stick. And we are not puppets. We are free and we have to show him our courage and kindness. Fine, sorry. Misses know-it-all. Let's go home! We carry on. My friends, Orleans was a success but the siege of Paris is a failure because we were not well prepared. Moreover, the King of Heavens is with Joan and then he's not. It's complicated. Actually, she's left a letter in which she explains that she's mad at you because you never listen. As a consequence, she's left to fight only with a small army. What an idiot! Your highness couldn't be more right. I've just been informed by an envoy that she's been captured by the English. Does his Highness want to raise an army to try to save Joan? Certainly not! She should have stayed here. Moreover, our armies don't need Joan. Now go! I said go! If it pleases your Highness, please allow me to have a talk with his Highness. Sorry, but who are you? I am Jacques Coeur. I am your great Master of monies. My Master of monies? What's that? I have been appointed to look after the Kingdom's finances and I have some advice for you. I'm listening. Actually, the society of knight in which we live in is totally obsolete. If you want to belong to the modern era and if you want to be all-powerful in your Kingdom, you need only one thing. What is it? You are aware that everyday farmers pay taxes to their landlords... Yes, thank you. I'm aware of that! You have to pass a law stating that from now on farmers won't pay taxes to their landlord anymore but to their King. This way, thousands of farmers will give you money and will make you richer and even more powerful. You'll become some kind of a super King of France. Not bad. Moreover, the landlords will be less rich and less powerful. Thus, his Highness will have nothing to fear from them. Not bad, not bad at all. With all that money, his Highness will be able to afford an army three time more powerful than his and he'll chase the English, until the last one, in less than a few years. - What's your name again? - Jacques Coeur! Do you have more ideas like this one? I've got hundreds of them! My lil' Queen, I've succeeded, haven't I? My armies have fought so fiercely. I have practically regained my entire Kingdom and my treasury is a hundred time larger. I'll be able to buy you jewels. This is nice but I'd rather have something other than jewels. What do you fancy? Dresses, you want Italian dresses! No! I want something that money can't buy! Something that money can't buy... Does that exist? Jesus Christ! Love doesn't exist anymore! I am lost! My dear friend. Is there anything wrong between you and the Queen? I've never understood women. She's never satisfied. I offered her jewels and Italian dresses. What else does she want? Your wife bothers you, is that right? No... well, may be... yes. Can you see that woman over there? This is a young lady of my wife. It's Agnes Sorel. Isn't she beautiful? She is but what's your point? You should have her as your mistress! My mistress! But it's forbidden! And you have to hide all the time, it's tiring. Your Highness should then pass a law making him free to have a mistress. And you'll see that she will be the kind to accept your jewels and your dresses. She'll even ask for more. Great! Do you have more ideas like this one? I've got thousands of them! Charles was definitely a jerk! He had betrayed Joan who had helped him so much and eventually got a mistress. She was far less brave and not the type to enjoy the mud of the battlefields. She was a little more superficial. Let's see who she really is. Who are you Agnes Sorel? Who am I?! Well, what do you think? I am the King's mistress. Am the most beautiful lady in the court. What do you think you bring to the Kingdom? You know... My opinion is that the Kingdom is not modern enough. Too many people prevent France from being the most beautiful country in the world. What matters is to wear the right fur and the right make up. In a conversation for instance, what matters is to look smart even though deep down inside you know you're an idiot. We need some tricks to hide our stupidity. Look at this peach... Isn't it wonderful? What matters is its shape and its nice color but the pit inside is useless because it can't be eaten! Is there any other qualities that are required to be a lady at the court? Like what? Kindness! Charity! You know, too many people exercise charity. They show off but they're missing the point. The point? Style is what matters the most! CHAPTER IV THE TRUST CONTRACT Hi girls! How are you? This is Opportune. She moved out of the city and would like to join our community. Great! Hello Opportune, welcome! Thank you. So this is your famous vegetable garden? We're going to give you a tour. Here, you can find Hawthorne, we make wine with it. It stimulates your head and helps with your blood pressure. Here, you have a camomile patch. It's good for digestion. We also make herbal tea with it. We pour it everywhere in the garden because it repels aphids. Sometimes, I use it to repel my migraines. It's such a great plant! This is a sage patch. It heals many things in your body but also in your mind. I take some everyday. It makes my mood swings go away. You have to know that I'm bad-tempered. Oh yeah? Yes but not when I have sage everyday. Okay then. And how many plant like these do you have here? Nearly 150 but don't worry, we'll show you everything. It will probably be long and boring. Who's that? I came to inform you of the Kingdom's new rules. The Kingdom's new rules? We make the rules, here. The Kingdom's new rules? We make the rules, here. Aren't you aware of the custom. According to custom, no one here tells us what to do because we're old enough to know what we have to do. Actually, the King and I have decided to put an end to the custom. It's too inefficient to have people doing their own specific laws. It's outdated. We've decided to do like the Romans. We want a strong and powerful kingdom which is well managed from the top. And this... You want to know if it's strong and powerful, asshole! True! And by the way, what are the new rules? I'd like to hear them. From this tree in the East to that one in the West you will grow cabbage. Are you out of your mind. Growing cabbage in the entire region... We will all get diarrhea! You won't have to eat it. - In this case, what's the point in growing it? - You will sell it. What for? To make money! Make money... but first this is forbidden and second we don't need money since we have a large vegetable garden and we cook everything ourselves. Yes but when you will only have cabbage you will have to go buy the rest at the market. I think I know where he's from. When I was on my way here, I passed by a circus. I'm pretty sure that he's a clown advertising for the next show. Oh okay! It seems really funny. None sense! Listen, I will send you one of my colleague. He might be better at convincing you than I am. Oh yes please, come back with him: If he's as funny as you, it's going to be huge! He made me laugh so much that I have stomach cramps. Actually, we do have a remedy for cramps. - It's a rose infusion. We'll show you. - Come. Who's that? - He's wearing weird clothes. - Do you think that he's the other clown? I guess so. You've caused lots of troubles to my colleague. I am hereto convince you. Great! Go ahead speak! We're listening. I need to talk with the leader of the group in private. There's no leader here. But I can play the boss. We'll have a duel! Do you know that game: "Who's the best at"? "Who's the best at"?! It's like a methodology competition: the best method to make crepes or the best method to build a cathedral for instance. If you want, I am not afraid. Twenty feet, that's alright. So are you ready? Ready! Ready! Who's best at designing a wheat field? Seeds have to be planted near oak-trees at waning gibbous. They have to reach ten feet. You need three poppies for one plant. When you harvest, you leave the highest plant available for the beggar passing by. Bravo! Your turn Mister Clown. On any farmable zone, you plant 50 acres of small wheat. You spray the fertilizer and when the plant reaches one foot fifty, you spray the pesticide to kill every insects around. Then, you use a combine harvester. I didn't understand a word, let's switch to the next one. Who's the best at a sacred temple? The square shape is the earth. The round is the sky. With stones, you build a cube which is place on the ground and on top of it, you build a dome that make the connection to the heavens. Inside, a fresco is painted in celestial blue. Mister Clown? A square shape is the best. If apples could have a square shape, it would be easier to put them in boxes. You accumulate the cubes, all the same, on an horizontal plane but also a vertical one. Cubes are far higher than cathedrals and inside you put people dressed like me who pretend to work. Eulaly: 2, Mister Clown: 0. You're obviously a clown so you have to say crazy things! We can't blame you. Would you stop this non sense about clowns! I am more than serious! Stop making fun of me! From now on the land from here to there belongs to my company and you must grow cabbage. This is not a joke! I don't understand. You're not actually a clown? Not at all and you must cooperate. Never! Get the hell out, moron! And never come back! Police! Arrest them! I have to go. They've taken to much of my time already. I have bigger fish to fry. - Down on your knees! Down! - We've done nothing wrong! On the ground! Don't move! Stay there! Asshole! We've done nothing. - Stand here! Stay still! - We've done nothing wrong! So what happened to girls like Melisande who would give orders to the boys? What happened to them? You know, they've been asked to stop. The world had changed and they wouldn't fit in anymore. They would have been totally lost. What is your field of expertise Melisande"? I can sew, I do embroidery, I also speak Occitan, Latin and Hebrew. I know the holy texts more than anyone else and I have written more than 800 poems. I know astronomy and the science of nature... You've been drifting. Don't you know something simple and useful for the well-being of a company. I don't know... maybe something like consumer-service? I've always been very committed to the well-being of the community. You can give me any service to handled, I'll be honored. Fine, customer-service it is! However, permanent contracts are out of fashion, let's have a temporary contract, okay? I trust you but what exactly is this mission? Mission? It might be a little exaggerated but you're right, it's a cool job, very dynamic! It's over there. Your job will be to take delivery of people's orders, that's all. Leana, what' going on? You went away to bring back the ball and you're coming back without it! I know, I was day-dreaming. Did I miss anything? The last thing I remember is the clown in a suit. Let's continue! I was almost done. Oh no, this can't be the end?! I admit that it wouldn't be an ideal ending. I should have make it happier, it's true. Did you write the book? Did you write the book? Well, I have been reading it my way, it's as if I had written it. Stand up, I'll show you one last thing. Can you see the house over there. It used to be a farm and that's where I was born. And here and around there were cows everywhere and pigs were killed at the farm. What else did I want to say? Oh yes, the vegetable garden. My mom used to grow camomile there for her migraines. And that's also where I've kissed my girlfriend for the first time. Why is it all gone? Well, what happened in the book, happened here as well. Thirty years ago, people came and built suburban houses. It's crazy that everything has been destroyed, just like that! Don't you think that they might have left something even a tiny detail of how it used to be? We never destroy something completely. It is necessary to look. Over there, it was the kitchen garden. It can be something left. May be here. You think it's the camomile? Camomile? It's possible. Give it to me. Thank you. We'll make some herbal tea for your mother, Leana. For her migraines! Malone, your dad's just arrived. Daniel, you must be exhausted, you woke up at 6 this morning. You should get some rest. It's so funny, the way she talks to me as if I was still a kid. Let's go! Hi! Daniel, please, your energy won't last forever. Please, I'm okay. I can go up by myself. Look, I'm good. It seems that nether your father nor my daughter said hi to me. Actually, it's not that I grew old, I've always been old: I must have been born in an other time: in the Middle-Ages when there were female knights and Amazons. No one believe me, anyway! They'll say that once again I'm telling stories to the kids that have disastrous endings. It's not my fault! History is actually falling down, like an apple... but fruits will grow again.
