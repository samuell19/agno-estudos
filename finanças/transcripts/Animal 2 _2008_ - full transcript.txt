(shouting) (gunshot) - Lord Jesus, I used to think. (shouting) But Lord I realize that violence is the artist, and I'm just aggression. Lord to break the chain you have to remove a link. Lord, I set out to find that link and remove it. But Lord sometimes I don't know if I have the will, or if I'm so arrogant to think that I'm the archangel Gabriel. (groaning) (scuffling) (rap music) - [Voiceover] Let's move, move it move it, let's go. - [Voiceover] Don't shoot, don't shoot, come on! - [Voiceover] Hey someone, there's a dead cop. - [Voiceover] Get him up, get him up! - What do you mean you can't give out any information, I'm his son. I just wanna know if my father is okay, okay, can you give me that information please? Yes, I'll hold. - Sup, brah? - Nothing man, I'm just trying find to out if Pop's okay. - From what I heard he's one of the hardest gangsters to ever step foot on this unworthy planet, man. - James, stop it. - No, not that I would know, because hasn't been around since I was a kid. - James Jr. Can you cool it, brah? Yes I'm still here. Thank you. Thank you very much. He's okay man, they're just gonna transfer him to another facility. - Another facility? Now why can't you just say prison? Because that's where he is, he in prison! Prison! And he ain't never getting out man, come on. - Look James, James, James-- - I'm going to school man. - Hey listen to me, now you know Pop loves you right? - Yeah... Yeah I know that, man. All right man, I love you man! - Get off of me fool. - Kiss, what's wrong with you? - You know I don't roll like that. You just get your behind to school man. - [Voiceover] Some of these prisoners to other facilities in order to defuse tensions. (rap music) - Stand the fuck up! You know what happened to me today? Wife bought a couch. $3,700. We don't have $3,700 in the bank, but with her being a consistent dumb bitch, she decides buying a $3,700 couch is more important than paying the mortgage. Reason I'm sharing this anecdote with you dumb fucks, is to let you know, do not fuck with me today. Because I will take out $3,700 worth of anger on one of you fuckers, and that's a lot of asswhoopin' and ain't none of y'all motherfuckers worth a dime! God gave you two ears and only one mouth, it means you should listen twice as much as you speak. So continue to shut the fuck up and hear what I'm saying and I might not kill your ass today. All of you motherfuckers is a bunch of fucking idiots. We know that because God always sends the dumbass motherfuckers to me, just like my dumbass couch-buying wife. James Animal Allen. Welcome home, it's been a long time. - Not long enough. - Hmm-mm, 15 years you did here, you finally get out and what happens? Straight back in the joint like every other dumb fuck that ever left here. They transfer you from Folsom, because you know niggers and spics get along, so I guess you're my problem now. - I ain't nobody's problem, sir. - Glad to hear it Animal, but we don't want more trouble like you had in Folsom. - I ain't start no riot. - Tell it to the warden. He's starting you off with a week in the hole. Send you a message. (rap music) (foreboding music) - Whoo-ee. Damn. That's official. - Yep. - Damn. You gonna have to hurry with that though. - You're greedy, you know that? - Hell yes. - That's what I'm talking about. - Alright, let's go. - Go where? - School, fool. - Nigga I'm trying to stay here and finish the rest of this chronic. - Dude you ain't been to school all week. - So why would I fuck my week up on going today? - Your mom ain't gonna trip? - Man I gave her like three joints, she ain't coming out of her room today. - Word, aight man I'm out. - Aight. Yo! - Yo! - Coming to the park after school today? - Oh yeah for sure. - Aight man. - [James] Peace. - Damn. Shit's crazy. (car horn honking) - Eh! You trying to give me a heart attack, man? - See I knew your little ass was in too much of a hurry to get to school. - Man I ain't gonna be late, don't you see me running? Why you ain't at work yet anyway? - Well I figured it was Friday, call and tell I'ma be a little bit late. - Uh huh. - Pick up a couple of breakfast burritos. Catch my little brother on the way to school. - Oh okay so, you got breakfast burritos in the car? - Yup. - Sausage and eggs? - Ain't that what you like? - You gonna be late, man! Damn. - Damn man why you eating that like that? Y'all been up just smoking weed huh? - Shit no. Now why you tripping? - I don't know why you hang with that fool anyway. - Tommy's cool man. He just need a little guidance. - Guidance? Now what you know about guidance? - As a brother I stayed on your ass so long you could barely breathe. - That's right, I ain't about to let up neither. - These both mine? (rap music) Yep. On time. - All right there man, have a good day. - Alright. - [Darius] Alright. - Let's go. Rise and shine. You ripe. What you been doing in there all week while I was enjoying my freedom? - Trying to figure out what a $3,700 couch looks like. - [Ellis] You and I both been at this a long time. We pretty much seen it all, ain't that right? - Pretty much. - Nowadays, it's like I never seen so much hating. I feel like this place's about to go apeshit, you know what I'm saying. - Man that's not my problem. - It's gonna be everybody's problem, Animal, when shit hits the fan. But you got respect. Don't forget that. Get his supplies and take him to his cell. - Get off of my bed. - The great Animal. Man. Hey man uh, don't confuse the fact that I let you have that bed means that I'm a punk, and that there's gonna be some ass cracking in here, 'cause there ain't gonna be no ass cracking. Because I guarantee you, if I get my ass cracked, ain't nobody sleeping around here, ever, not a wink. - Calm down son, I ain't got no intention of raping your little ass. - Well that's good news. Hey uh, name's Lou by the way. Hey I heard about that riot you started with them Mexicans man. - [Animal] Ain't started nothing with nobody. - That's not what I heard, I heard you cut up this Mexican dude and the whole place went crazy, man. But that's your business. I just thought you might wanna know about Uno, is all. Man he's this big Mexican dude, man. Leader of 'em all in fact. - What about him? - His cousin is the dude you cut up. I mean the dude they say you cut up. But that's none of my business. So I guess you coming back here is supposed to be a big deal or something, right? - Why is that? - You know the fights, you know the fights man. - What fights? - You know the fights between the two inmates man, everybody bet on it, everybody in on that man. - Captain Ellis? - Nah, nah he old school man, but Hollywood, he all up in that. - Hollywood? - Yeah, that's what we call the warden, on account that he always going to movie auditions, he wanna be some big movie star or something. Well Kasada, he give Hollywood and the guards their cut and nobody mess with 'em. - So what that got to do with me? - They say back in the day man, you used to be a bad ass when it came to the fights man, Kasada set 'em up and bam, you knocked 'em down man. - Yeah well, more power to him. I don't do that no more. - That's crazy, man. - What? - Because Kasada already set up your first fight. - Where do I find Kasada? - Where you find any pastor, at the church. (rap music) (frantic gasping) - Degenerate motherfucker, are you gonna pay, are you? You owe the church $200 you miserable piece of shit! And the Bible says, to give wholeheartedly, you fucking prick! Hey, I forgive you. But I'm gonna send you out amongst the wolves and you will get me the money that you owe the church, and I want it this afternoon, a-fucking-men! Are you surprised? See, when the others were studying to become jailhouse lawyers, I studied to become a jailhouse pastor. I read the good book, took a couple of tests, and voila, I am the inmate pastor. And membership has its privileges. - I guess you won't be the first man to fuck up in the name of God. I'm not fighting. - Now wait a minute. Don't turn down shit 'till you heard the whole deal. When I heard about the riots over there, I took a special interest in you. Yeah, I pulled a few strings with the help of my friend the warden, had you transferred here, the whole thing. And now, I need you to run the niggers for me. Because right now they're not playing ball with my dope game. Ralo's running things over there, and he says the brothers gotta buy their dope from him. Well that's 50% of my business, and I want those customers back so I need you to take his ass out. - And I assume you're gonna tell me why I would do this. - Well for the money of course, you're gonna get a decent cut. Decent enough to get both of your boys out of the projects. - Don't talk about my family, I take care of 'em you understand? - When was the last time you saw James Jr.? - I said don't talk about my family! - Alright. But I want you to think about this. - No need to think about it. God forgive you. - Have it your way. (rap music) I always preferred plan B anyway, boys. (gun fires) (rap music) - Damn, nigga. This shit is fly, when you get this? - [Driver] The other day, yo let me hit that bud. - Damn hold on brother, I'm gonna smoke the whole thing. - Yo, pass that shit. Yeah I done come up since I started working for Twist. - I see that man, when can I be down? - On the real, that's why I'm here. - Oh for real, Twist want a player like me on the team huh? - Nah he asking about your boy James Jr. - Why? - When that nigga asking to do something, you don't ask why, you just do it. - Is it something bad? - Nah. - I thought you say you ain't know what he wanted. - If it was something bad I would've shot your ass already. Hop in. - Alright. (rap music) (siren wailing) (gun fires) ♪ Since I can remember ♪ There's been a debate over creation ♪ Some say you evolved ♪ Just a biological mutation ♪ - Hey gimme yo money fool! - Hey man you play too much man.

Yo let James sit in the front. - Man fuck that, I'm trying to let the little honeys see me, know what I'm saying? - Nigga, get yo ass in the backseat. I ain't playing with you. - Why you G'd up, dog? - Because I wanna talk to James and I don't need you telling me what you're gonna do in my motherfucking car. - Look man, y'all just work it out, I'ma walk aight? - Man just get in the car. Damn. - Haha, I remember you. - Yo, the boss. - Who? - Big Twist, man. He's like a ghetto version of the True Hollywood Story. He used to be a small time dope man right? Then one day, he got kidnapped and robbed. I'm talking about they stole all his shit. The niggas he owed, they didn't give a fuck about him getting robbed, they just wanted their cheese. So they go looking for this motherfucker right? To peel his cap back. But outta nowhere Twist come up with all the money, plus interest and instead of recopping from them, they start buying off him. And when Twist caught up with the niggas who robbed him, shit, him and his boys chopped them fools up like Peking Wok boy, turned them into Kung Pao niggas for real. - Yo, James! Check it out, man! - Now how the hell you know this shit? - I know everything man, come on. What up Big Twist? - [Twist] What's cracking dog? - [Tommy] No shit dawg, I'm just trying to get my chill on, you feel me? I was gonna ask you if-- - [Twist] You James? - Yeah. - I knew your Pops homey, Animal. He's a straight up legend. Of course he had to be around them times to know that, but, your pops is good people. - Yeah well, I wouldn't know. - Yeah I feel you, must've been hard not having your father around when you was growing up. - It's cool man, my brother he looks out for me. - Oh shit that's right, Little Animal is your brother huh? - Nah he don't go by that no more man. - Well check it, I'ma look out for you from now on, brah. - Why? - Hey dog this man is offering you his friendship and shit man, what's up? - That's cool. Look, your Pa looked out for me back in the day. I'm just trying to return the favor, that's all. Dig? - Yeah well, thanks. - Y'all come to the J Club tonight. - What? - We ain't 21, man. - Don't even worry about that. I'ma send a car to pick y'all up. - Hey thanks Big Twist, boy!

B+, boy you slippin'. - Slippin', man I'm smarter than the teacher. - Yeah, I see you had to let him know that too. - Exactly. - Now what you need to do is keep your books open and your mouth closed, man. But you know what? For doing such a bomb job on your report card, I'm taking you to your favorite spot to eat tomorrow night, how about that? - Red Lobster? - Well ain't that what you like? - Shoot you know it. Look, I'm just a little tired, so I'ma call it a night. - You feeling all right? - [James] Yeah I'm feeling all right. - All right then little brah. - All right then, don't forget the dishes, man. - Whatever. - [James] I eat all the pizza, you clean all the dishes! - Hey good job on that report card, dog!

Need some help? - No. Ain't no problem. - Hey, thanks for coming. - I ain't here for you. - Hey I thought I told you, nobody else. - Relax will you? Animal here is our partner. - I ain't partners with nobody. - And I told you to think about that, didn't I? Now you think about this. Last night, I had your son James Jr. framed for murder. - Motherfucker! - You ever do another fucking stupid thing like that, and the Assistant District Attorney here will see that your son ends up in prison, I swear to fucking Christ! Now. If you don't play ball with me, then I promise you that Mr. Dillen here, will prosecute your son to the full extent of the law. And he will end up in prison. And I will arrange for a reception committee to fuck him up the ass so bad. That his asshole will look like a big chug when they are through with him. Now, Mr. Dillen will do exactly what I tell him to do, because two years ago, at his office Christmas party, I arranged for an incredible piece of ass to throw herself at him, and Mr. Dillen, in his inebriated state took her home and banged her. Unfortunately for Mr. Dillen, the young lady in question was underage. So Mr. Dillen has been beholden to me ever since, if he doesn't do what I tell him to do... I'll turn his ass in. And he will end up in prison, and the big chug scenario will apply to him. So. My only question to you, Animal is this. Do you really have anything to think about? That's all for now, you can go. Thanks again for coming. I sure as hell hope that you can control your people. - I'll do what I have to do. But in eight months, we're through. Scumbag. - Now is that any way to talk to a pastor, you fuck? How'd you like me to have you baptized, asshole? (hip hop music) (knock on the door) - [Woman] Hey! I thought I wasn't gonna see you until tomorrow. - I have a little surprise for you and I wanted to tell you about it personally. Guess who's starting her first day at the public defender's office tomorrow? - What? Really, me? Oh my God! - [Dillen] I pulled some strings. - So when do I start? Oh, you said tomorrow. Okay, but Dillen, no more favors. - I know, I know, you wanna do it all on your own. ♪ 360 degrees ♪ And now I got my niggas telling such to thieves ♪ Come on ♪ Little things in the street life ♪ Little things in the society ♪ (mellow rap beat) - Hi, I'm Kate Martinez. - Here you go. - Thanks.

I know you guys usually deal with a bunch of scumbags and everything, but my brother's different, alright? It was his best friend that got shot and killed. Now I know you got a huge case load, you don't care nothing about your clients, but check this out. That's his report card, alright? All A's and one B plus. He's not that kind of kid. - I'm reviewing the case right now. Why don't you just give me a few-- - Yeah right, look, look. I would have hired a real lawyer, alright? But I had to spend my money on bail. I know you got 100 other cases and everything, but yo, look. He's innocent, alright? That's my brother, this one right here is different. - As a matter of fact, I happen to be a real lawyer. And this is my only case, so you don't have to worry. - Wait, wait, hold up. What do you mean this is your only case? - It's my first day. - Your first day? Man, get the fuck outta here, what the hell is going on? Bullshit! (rap music) - Hey! Got a new transfer in here. Let's get him set up. - Hello. - Scarface. - Po Po Lou. - [Lou] They don't call me that no more, man. - Why, you ain't shit your pants no more? - It was only the one time. And I told y'all. That was chili. I was still hungry, I was trying to smuggle some food back to my cell. - Back in yo ass, nigga? - That's how they get the drugs in! - No nigga, that was your first night in jail. And yo ass was just a little too nervous, that's the fucking problem right there, boy. - Man, do you need anything else? - Nigga, I'm just fucking with you man, it's all good. Yo, I heard that Animal's the top shot caller in this motherfucker right here. Yo man, I did time with that nigga back in Folsom during the riots, that shit was crazy, man. They had niggas transferred out right away in this shit, man. - Animal's the hardest, coldest gangsta I know. Old school. They don't make them like that no more. - What, you like, his biggest fan now? - No, no. I'm just saying, I ain't never see a G do it like that before, that's all. - [Scarface] I do my thing, too. - Yeah, but not like that. - I get the job done man, he ain't the only nigga putting in work. - Maybe. - The fuck you mean maybe, nigga? - Look man. Never mind, it's all good, alright? - Let me tell you something, I'm sick of motherfuckers taking credit for my work and let me tell you something else, nigga. Nigga! I'm the one who started that riot. Yeah, that's right. One of Kasada's boys came up to me and offered me cheese to do a hit on a nigga. - [Lou] Kasada? - Yeah Kasada, he got people everywhere, nigga. Shit, I ain't even know this dude. Stuck him right in his face, I ain't got nothing personal against him, but I gotta make that paper, you feel what I'm saying? I ain't even know it was Hulu's cousin, and that's what started the riot. So next time you wanna pull your pump, know what I'm saying, make sure you holler out for this nigga right here, son. You heard me? - [Ellis] Walk it in Walters, let's go. Pastor of the Cherry Point will bless you. (rap music) - [Darius] You see this, you see this? This is exactly what I was talking about! You hang out with fucking thugs man, you get caught up. Get your ass in the goddamn car! The fuck was you thinking James, huh? Answer me, boy! - Tommy's dead. - Look man, what happened to Tommy was horrible, okay? Tell me everything that happened. - I didn't do it. You know? I didn't do it. - Hey man, some dude was found dead behind the church. - Scarface? - How you know that? (rap music) (grunting) - Animal. I need to talk to you. - [Kate] Now you're sure that's everything you can remember? - [James] Yeah. - [Kate] You never saw the weapon? - I told you, no! All I heard was a gunshot and Tommy was dead. - Eh, James. Calm down man, alright? I know it's hard, just be cool alright? Just answer the questions, alright? - It's alright, I'm on your side. Darius, you're his step brother, correct? - [Darius] Correct. - And your mom, Ms. Allen, where is she? - She passed away. - Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? - Hey look, do we have to talk about this right now? - It's gonna come up in court, we should be prepared. - She died of a drug overdose. - And Mr. Allen? - He's in prison. - Wait, don't to that! - Do what? - Look just 'cause our father's in prison, you assume that this is a lost cause. - No, I don't. But yes, the jury might. - Isn't it your job to make them see it the right way? (metallic slam) (ominous music) - [Animal] Hey, son. - [Darius] Pop. - There's some people in here trying to make me do things by framing your brother. - Why? - It don't matter. You just need to keep your brother safe. - I'll get a second job. And a real lawyer that's gonna-- - Listen. Listen Darius. Just leave it alone. If I do what they want, it'll be over in a couple of months, and if I don't, they'll continue to frame James Jr. - There's gotta be something I can do. - No, there's nothing you can do. This thing goes way up the ladder, to some very... To some very important people who will do anything to stay on top. - Pop, this is my fault man, this is all my fault. - Why do you say that? - You're in here man, because you took the blame for me. - Darius, just stop. Stop it. - I got into an argument with you. And I shot you. I shot you and left you with a gun I knew had murders on it. And you get charged with those murders. - Stop it Darius. Someone might hear you, stop it. - I don't care if somebody hear me, Pop. I should have never let you talk me into leaving that scene. - It's okay. - Why Pop, huh? Why is it okay for you to spend the rest of your life in jail for a crime I committed? You got a son out there man, that needs you. - You needed me, Darius. I wasn't there. What about that? I let you watch me do things a son should never see his father do. And I remember what I said, just like it was yesterday. I said, "Now you can kill a nigga." See son, I didn't have any love for myself, and I didn't have any love for anyone who looked like me, black, brown, yellow, red. Now I don't wanna make the same mistake with James Jr. So please. Let me do this, son. I don't want our next generation growing up in prison. Let it stop right here, right now, with me. - Bet. Okay. So what are you gonna do? - Exactly what they want. (metallic slam) - You know who you're fighting? That's Raulo, current leader of the Darkies. I don't want him walking out of here. You understand me? - Son, if you don't wanna die, you should just walk away. - Walk away? I'ma fuck you up. (energetic music) (thuds and grunts) (sharp crack) (grunting) (sharp crack) Come on, man! Motherfucker, what you got? What you got? (sharp thud) (grunting) (sharp crack) (sharp crack) (metallic bang) (painful grunts) (desperate grunting) (guttural shouting) - I've been calling, you guys never made your appointment. - [Darius] Oh yeah? - Listen, I have some news that can prove James is innocent. - Oh yeah, that's cool, you should get on that. - Darius, we found a witness. - What? - Across the street. From where the murder took place. There's a bank where a witness was taking money out of the ATM. And he heard the gunshot. - Did he see what happened? - No, he ran for cover as soon as he heard the shot. - So he ain't see shit? - No, he didn't. But the ATM camera did. Did you hear me, isn't this great? - Listen, you need to forget about it. - What? - Look my father, he has everything under control. - Your father is incarcerated! - That's what this is about. - Darius, you have to trust me. - Trust you? Trust you? Lady, I don't even know you. Alright listen, you bring your high-society ass down here, to talk about some crusade that you can talk about at your next dinner party. But see, while you're up there passing around the Grey Poupon and shit, we down here doing the real crusade. So give me a fucking break on that trust me shit, alright? - I'm gonna subpoena that video. - Yeah you do that! (metallic slam) - This shit's fucked up but we still got a operation to run here. Now that Raulo's gone, we need to make some changes. We need to vote on a new leader. - [Animal] What y'all talking about? - Like I was saying before. We gotta stay strong and let them know that just because Raulo's gone, we still ain't nothing to be fucked with. - So who's gonna be the leader? - Well shit, nigga. We 'bout to vote on it. - That right? I think you wanna be the leader. - Why you say that? - You the one doing all the talking. Giving the motherfucking General Patton speech trying to rally the troops and shit. Nah, nigga. Ain't gonna be no vote. I'm your leader. - This is bullshit, nigga. What makes you our leader? - I'm stupid. Ain't that right, Lou? - You're the stupidest nigga I know, man. - Now Im'a give y'all my resume. Name is Animal. Now for those of y'all who new here, just ask the man to your left or to your right. I guarantee you you one degree of separation from knowing about all the work I done put in here. Now if you have doubts, well... I suggest you do some research. And if you still have doubts in the air, then I invite you to come visit me in my cell and maybe I can convince you otherwise. - You ever heard some shit like that before? - I never even seen something like that before. But if I were you, I wouldn't go, man. Hey yo, Animal. They say you top dog. - I know.

What's your problem? - [Ellis] Keep it down. (phone rings) - Hello? - Kate, this is Darius Allen. - Darius? Is everything okay? - Look, I'm sitting here and I've decided that, um. Listen, we have that whole attorney, client thing with you, right? - Yes, of course. You can tell me anything, I can help. - Alright, look. My brother was set up. (metallic slam) (ominous music) - Hey Pop. - What's up, son? Who this? - This is Junior's attorney, Kate Martinez. - Kate, this is my father, James Allen Sr. I had to tell her, Pop. - Tell her what? - About the setup. - Darius. (ominous music) - Champ, do me a favor. Pull out that log sheet of yours and tell me who's meeting with James Allen. - His son, Darius Allen. And his other son, James Allen Junior's lawyer. Kid's up on a murder wrap. Like father, like son, huh? Mm hmm. - Apparently. - There's a video that proves your son is innocent. An ATM video. - Where's the video? - Well we're getting it from the bank today. See, I know there are things that you can tell me about what happened. And if I'm gonna help James, you have to tell me everything. - When you have that video, and you're sure it proves James Jr.'s innocent, we'll take it from there. - That's fair enough. I'll deal with you later. - What do you mean I won't cut you? Oh, I'll cut you. I'll cut you. I'll cut you real good. What do you? What do you mean I won't cut you? (clears throat) Son of a bitch! You ever heard of knocking? - [Ellis] Sorry sir, but we need to talk. - [Hollywood] Give me a minute. - I'm afraid this needs to be dealt with right away. These fights that Kasada's putting on is causing a lot of tension within the population, specifically between the blacks and the Mexicans. Now I know you think this is harmless, sir. But I respectfully disagree. I think this place is getting ready to blow and it's not gonna be pretty when it does. We need to shut this thing down. - Look. The prisoners just need to blow off a little steam. It's no big deal. - It's gonna be a big deal, sir, if it turns into a serious riot. Have you ever seen a serious riot, sir? - Don't you patronize me. This is my prison. I'll run it my way. Now get the fuck out of my office. - Counselor. What is it I can do for you? - We got a problem. An ATM video proves Animal's kid didn't do it. - Well that's very interesting. What do you intend to do about it? - There's nothing to do. It's over. - You know, you Ivy League boys are supposed to be so fucking smart. But you're really fucking stupid. It is not over, until it's done. Now you said, that you were gonna use people that you could control. Now if you've got a person that you're using, that is getting in the way of your control, you have a decision to make. Who's more important? You? Or them? - Shit! - I am telling you that nobody from my office picked it up. But they weren't from my office! Why would the bank give them the video? But I have the subpoena, how could they have one? How long will it take to get another one? Three days? Okay, please just do it. Thanks. (rap music) - I got you. - Get out the fucking car! Get out the, don't move motherfucker, don't move! Motherfucker, I need to talk to you. - I'm busy, dog. - You busy? You 'bout to motherfucking be busy bleeding! Oh, it's funny? Shit is funny? Y'all fuckers killed Tommy and set me up? - Hey man, y'all-- - The fuck, man? Shut up! - Man. - [James] Punk ass. - Yeah? You don't know who you fucking with, bitch. - Your punk ass better bring me to Twist. - Man, you don't know who-- - I said shut the fuck up! Bring my ass to Twist! 'Cause I could do this shit all day, man! But I can see your nose is starting to look like a fucking bloody ham hock. What it's gonna be? - Alright, alright, but it's your motherfucking funeral. - [James] Say some shit! (rap music) - Somebody here to see you. (high-pitched screaming) - Tell them to put down the guns, man. - What can I do for you, young blood? - You killed Tommy, man. - What makes you think that? (gunshot) - I ain't playing with you! - Woah, youngster. - I ain't fucking playing with you! - You need to be smart right now. The fuck you think gonna happen you pull that trigger? You don't think my boys here gonna kill you? And what about your brother? - Hey, don't say shit about my brother, man! - Your brother. You acting real protective like over the man shot your own father. Oh, my bad. You ain't even know that shit, huh? See, I was there when OGs like your father paved these streets. And yeah, I was just a little nigga tagging along behind him, but I made sure to carve my name into the wet pavement before it dried, you dig? So even though over time, people forget things and shit gets changed, certain things, certain things, youngin.' You feel me? I know your brother shot your father. Left him there to die and take the wrap for the murder weapon. Oh yeah. So your own brother is the reason that you had to grow up without a father. Damn. If that ain't some ironic shit. What? You don't believe that? You think I'm lying? Go ask him, then. You ask him, and you look him in the eyes when you ask him. See if those eyes don't tell you the truth. - Should I go smoke that fool? - Nah, we can't touch him. I gave Kasada my word. - Fuck that, he broke my nose! - What, you mad? (shrill whimper) Be mad at me then, fool. Shouldn't have brought that nigga here anyway. Shit. - [Kate] Can I help you? - Are you Kate Martinez? - Yes. - I'm from Susanville Penitentiary. And I know you were there recently. I also know of a way where we can help each other out. - Well, what do you mean? Are you okay? - Um. You have a client named, James Allen? - Yeah. - His father's incarcerated at Susanville. Okay? I believe this man is being blackmailed. - I knew it, I mean that's great to know, I figured he was set up, but I had no idea who was behind it. What else do you know? - No, no, I can't talk about this here. - Well can you meet me somewhere else, then? - [Ellis] I'll call you. - [Champ] You said you wanna know who visits him? - So spit it out. - [Champ] Log shows a lawyer and his son, Darius Allen. - Why would he need a lawyer? - [Champ] It's not his lawyer, it's his other son, James Allen Jr.'s. - Mind if we talk? Guess who you're fighting next? - Who? - Uno. - You had this planned all the time. Make me the leader of the blacks, fight the leader of the Mexicans, a race war sparks, the white boys sit back and take over. - You have a great day, my friend. (cell phone rings) - Hello? Kate, I'm at your place with food. Yeah, I thought you were done with work by three. Oh, okay. No, that's fine, I understand. Yeah, love you too. (cell phone rings) Hello? - Your shit is starting to unravel. And you need to take care of it, now! - I went down and got the videotape, but they're just gonna give her another one in a few days. - You said that you were gonna use people that you could control. - Yeah, well I thought I could. - Look, I am too close, here! I'm not gonna let you fuck this up for me! - Look, there's something else. She's made a connection between the kid and Animal, about the blackmail. But it's cool, I'm the only one she's told, so I'll handle it. - How did she find out? - One of the guards, a guy named Ellis. - Alright, look. You take care of that lawyer, I will take care of Ellis. - I can't. - [Kasada] Just find out where she fucking lives, and I will send somebody. - It's not that simple. - Look. You are not gonna get your pretty little hands dirty. - She's my fiance. - What? You've got to fucking be kidding me! - I'm glad you find that amusing. - You are a bonafide imbecile. Why in the world would you use your fiance? What, because you thought that you could control her? I just hope you can get the deposit back on the wedding cake. - [Dillen] What's that supposed to mean? - I mean that one of you is not gonna make it to the church on time. And I'll let you decide which one that is. (ominous music) - But I love her. - Well you should have thought of that before you got her involved in this. Wouldn't you say? Now. Either you take care of this, or my boys will. And if my boys take care of this, well... They like to play before they work. That's all I'm gonna say on the subject. (ominous music) (car alarm beeps) (engine revs) (serene music) - [Ellis] What's wrong with her? - [Man] I think it's a head gasket. - [Ellis] Oh yeah? You try starting it up a few times? Sometimes they do that. (suspenseful music) What the hell? (gunshot cracks) (ominous music) (gunshot cracks) (ominous music) (gunshots crack) (ominous music) (engine revs) (tires squeal) (serene music) - James! Yo! James! Hey, hey man. What's up? Why'd you wanna meet here? - Are you the reason my father's in jail? - What? - Are you the reason my father's in jail? - Who told you that? - Did you shoot my father, put him in jail for life? Don't bullshit me! - Yeah. - All this time, that's why you're always on my ass? It's 'cause this shit is your fault? Man, I thought it was love. - It was, it is, it is. - That's bullshit! You felt guilty! This whole shit is a lie. Your own father. - Look James, I'm sorry, man. I should have explained it sooner, man, I should have. - Well fuck you and fuck your sorry, man! Your father! How does it feel, huh? How does it feel to have a gun in your face? - James, put the gun down man, you don't wanna do this, alright? - Why? Huh? You did it. And now you wanna beg for your life? - Look, I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours. Listen, what's happening to me right now man, I deserve without a doubt. I've tried so many times, man. To look you in your eyes man, and tell you. What happened. Yeah man, we had an argument. I was upset. 'Cause I just found out about you. Pop man, he was in prison, man, for so long, and I'd been waiting for him my whole life. So when he got out, I thought man, finally, you know? Finally, I got my father. And it was so cool for a while, man. Then he met your moms. They had you. And he gave you his name. Man, that fucked me up. I was furious man, I was upset. I confronted him. We argued. And I shot him. Yeah, I shot my own father. And that gun I bought off the street had murders on it. So it was either turn me in, or take the wrap for the gun. Pop man, he figured, hey, you know. I'm already a two-time loser. He was being a father to me. And now look at this, man. You got a gun pointed at me now. It's funny how sins always seen the fathers. - Nah, I don't know what to believe, man. - You don't have to believe me, James. Believe in yourself, man. Put the gun down, man. It's all good, man. - I told you. - Hey. I never doubted you for a second, little brother. I never doubted you for a second, man. - We'll show this to the judge tomorrow. - Well you know what? I think we should celebrate, man. Huh? Kate, stay for dinner. - I would love to, but my fiance's planning dinner for me at home. - Okay. So uh, listen, you and um. Your man's name, was? - Dillen, he's actually the assistant district attorney. - Cool, okay, well, um. Listen, you and Dillen, you guys have a wonderful time tonight. (ominous music) (phone rings) - Hello? - [Voiceover] You have a collect call from James Allen, do you accept the charges? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I accept the charges. - [Voiceover] Go ahead, sir. - Pop, hey. Hey, check it, we got the video. - Good. Have you seen it? - Yeah, it shows that James didn't do it. - Where's the video? - Nah, Kate has it, she's taking it to court this morning. - Kate has it? Why don't you have it? - No, trust me Pop, Kate won't let nothing happen to it. - Look, I don't know Kate, you know, I don't trust Kate. - Pop. Calm down okay? I understand. - No, you don't understand. I have to do something today that might cause all hell to break loose in this prison. Now unless that tape is in court, I have to do it. - Pop, trust me. I've seen it. It's a for sure thing. - Darius. This thing goes way high. The assistant D.A., the warden. - Wait, wait, wait, hold up, what did you say? The assistant district attorney? - [Animal] Yeah. - Dillen! - What, what, you know city officials now? - No, no, no, no, Pop, you don't understand, that's Kate's fiance! - Are you sure about this? - I'm absolutely sure, I mean. What you want me to do? - Dillen. What happened, are you okay? - Yeah, I was at work, I fell asleep. I'm fine. - I waited up and I called you. I was really worried. - Look, I'm okay, I just... Have a lot on my mind. I brought you a coffee. - I smell alcohol, were you drinking last night? - Yeah, earlier. The D.A. wanted to talk, we had a couple drinks. - There's something you wanna tell me? - Like what? - Is there someone else? - No. No. Don't be silly, it's just work. - I know I've been a pain lately with this case and all. I feel like a weight has been lifted. My God. And this was just my first case. What a rush. It's everything I was dreaming about. Making a difference, you know? Oh. And you will follow up on that prison situation? It's disgusting what's been going on in there. And I'm gonna try and reopen the case against James Allen Sr. Listen to me. I'm babbling. Okay, I'll stop talking shop, I promise. I'm sorry I've been so distant from you. But. I'm gonna make it up to you. I love you. So. Here's to our life together. - Oh, shit. (cell phone rings) - Hello? - Hey Kate, listen. I just talked to my father. And your fiance is part of this whole thing. (ominous music) - What are you talking about? - Listen, some man named Kasada has some kind of dirt on him. And he made him help frame James Jr. - Hey, don't be ridiculous. - Listen, everything my father is doing is for James, he wouldn't lie about this, alright? Kate, my father might not be sure about you, but I am. Okay, and I know you have nothing to do with this. Which means you're in danger. Okay, so listen, tell me where you are. - What if you're wrong? - Kate. Listen to me. They cannot let that tape go to court today. Alright, listen, if I'm wrong, so what? But if I'm right, they gotta get rid of you. Okay? So please, tell me where you are. - I'm at home. - Alright, you're at home. Let me get the address. - [Kate] I'm not going to-- - Look, just tell me what it is, damn! - It's 12 Collins, apartment five. But I'm with-- - I'm on my way. Dillen's involved. - [James] Let's go. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, you got court today, so uh. Um, look. I'll meet you in the court parking lot later, okay? (ominous music) - What does Kasada have on you? Now I know why I only had one case. Why you pulled strings to get me hired. - It was never supposed to go this far. Kate, you gotta believe me. - But you want to stop me from going to court today. (ominous music) Oh my God! Dillen. - Kate, they were gonna hurt you. And this way. - And this way, what, Dillen? This way what? (metallic squeaking) - Im'a go in here and I'ma whoop some ass now. (metallic slam) (radio chatter) - Hey, um. So how's she doing? - She was poisoned with trimenidal chloride. If you hadn't gotten here when you did... Let's just say she's very lucky. And also, whoever did this wasn't aware that caffeine actually minimizes the effect. - Oh hey, thanks. (radio chatter) Hey. - What time is it? - Look, don't worry about that, you know, you just need to relax. - I have to get to court. The arraignment's at. - Wait, wait, wait just slow down, slow down, alright, sit your ass down, just don't move. Listen, you're going to the hospital. We'll get down there, and we'll tell them everything that happened, okay? - There's too much riding on this, we can't give them another chance to cover it up. Until we get James cleared, your father's in danger. - Alright well wait a minute, you want me to drive you? Hold up. - Mr. Mason. What brings you down here today? - Just a little observation. What's on the docket? - The James Allen murder case. You know it? - Well sure, I heard about it. How's it going? - Kid didn't show up with his lawyer. Judge revoked bail, we just broke for lunch. - What case you working on? - I apologize for being late, but I was detained. - Kate. I can explain. - No, just stop. Okay? Just stop. Stop, just shut up, okay? I don't wanna hear it anymore! That's enough! - Hey. What's going on out here? - Your Honor, I have a video that fully exonerates my client. And proves he was framed. This is the evidence, this tape. - Not here. - Kate. - I want everyone in my chamber. (ominous music) - Don't be so serious. This is going to be fun. Here's Uno.
