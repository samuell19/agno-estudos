Place of work? - I have recently served at he Army. Where did you serve? - In the Army. Will you join us? - No. You fractured his guard's arm and almost knocked out his eye.

Director. What was the song? - "Wings" by Nautilus. Bagrov Sergei Platonovich, was born in 1942, ...thief-recidivist. Was killed in the prison in January of 1982. My classmate. Do you have a compact-disk of Nautilus "Wings"? What do you want? Get out of here! Or I'll call the militia. Would better chop wood than blow your face. You'd better stay in the Army. Here, fool, you will be killed soon. You still switch on your piece of ironmongery! Will die in the prison as your good-for-nothing father. The only hope I have is My Vitenka. Probably an important person there In Leningrad. Look at that, everybody small is very pretty God! Look! - OK, I've seen. But look once more! Well, you'd rather go to your brother in Leningrad. I'll die soon, but he was there for you instead of your father It's your blood. He is the closest man to you in all the world. My Vitenka! "BROTHER" 'Who hasn't been to Moscow hasn't seen beauty.' Chechen was dismissed. It's necessary to kill him. He's taken all of the market. Listen, what he says: 'Everything was mine in the past.' He takes from our places. At the meeting we have come to the agreement. Ours don't want the war, but he is Paramon's relative. This Chechen is here! In short, fifteen. You know me, my prices are real. Fifteen... This money, of course, are good but for the Chechen... Here I stick my neck out. How much? - Twenty. Ten now. One week for preparation. Two. Tatarin is an insolent fellow. He's taken a lot in advance. Stay at the market, don't catch his eye. 'Take burden for youself, to fall not when you'll run.' Miss, do you have "Wings" of Nautilus? No. It's sold out very quickly. But come again, we'll have more. Have you got anything else? - Sure. Here you are, "Titanic na Fontanke" with Grebenchikov. And this is "Account for ten years". "Friends sing the best songs." How much is this? This is 75800, and this is 78000. OK, assholes, how is it going? You have got alarm clocks? Well, everyone gives 50 now! From you, nit! I said from you, nit! And what did you think? Taxes! - But I haven't... Confiscate goods! I haven't sold anything yet! - I said I'd confiscate! But, sun, I, I... I've sold nothing. I have sold nothing! I have told you! City? City is a terrible force. And the bigger is the city, the stronger is its force. It carries away. Only a strong man can get out. And so... What is your name? - Goffman. Jew? - German. A! Well I don't like Jews a lot. What about the Germans? - The Germans? OK. What is the difference? - Listen, why do stick to me? Where have you taken me? - My motherland. My ancestors lie here. Sit down. Take it. - Wait! What is this? - I got presents for my brother. OK, it's not destiny. Oh! Give me. She is pretty. Girl, how do you do? Tickets, please. No, ticket. - Tickets, please. No, ticket. - Your tickets, please. Listen, you are not Russian, do you? I tell you in Russian: I don't have ticket! Pay a fine, please! Listen, what fine? I am an invalid. Pay a fine or show the ticket! Listen, there is no truth in standing up, Sit down. But if you don't have tickets you have to pay a fine. Listen, don't you understand, do you? Come on, come on! Pay a fine! Brother, don't kill! Take the money, take everything, do you hear? Don't kill, brother! Here you are! You are not my brother, blackarse nit! How much is the fine? - Seven. Run! Oh, fellows, fellows! It's not 'Nahra'! 'Norah', 'Norah', do you understand? In short, you have to go such way. Bye. Hi! Ooh! You player is cool! Give me to listen. And what do you have? Is there anything normal? Are you dumb? - No. You have an excellent player but dressed badly. Do you have LSD? And money? Do you have money? - No, I don't. OK, I am Kat. You can always find me here. If you have money, come here. OK, bye! It's open! Kneel! Hands forward! I am looking for my brother. Bagrov Victor, he lived here. I am his younger brother. I am in Leningrad only for two days. Mother gave me his address: Moika, 1, apartament 8. Hi, brother. It's not Leningrad, but Petersburg. Piter is a beautiful city but province. It's necessary to go to Moscow. There is all force in Moscow. When I'm through here I will go to Moscow How is mother there? - OK. Here you are for you from her. You drink, drink. But I got a business today. Take it at first time. Dress well. Rent an aparament or room. Not more then hundred, and then we'll see. How is at the Army? - OK. Mother wrote that you had been at war. Oh, no, I was a military clerk in headquarters. But can you shoot? We were at the shooting-ground. Hello, do you have "Wings" of Nautilus? OK, give me what you have. He is a Chechen ex-terrorist. They went to Piter from Moscow too. They have captured everything, brother. I have told you. This one has taken the market and now suppresses the Russians. I have a part in that business, do you understand? He knows that we are weak now, and he suppresses. He has bought everyone there, you know, ...and he's killed those he couldn't buy. And now is my turn, Danila. If I don't pay... So either them or us. So, brother. He likes to go around the market on the day. To look through his possessions, skunk. This is the best place. He has got his guard always with him - two or three fighters. Everyone is caucasian. With guns. Beasts! In general, it's not simple. Look closely, think, how you can go. Better I'll give YOU money. 2000 dollars Don't come to me, it's dangerous. If something happens call me. Take this gun with charger and sixteen hundred. We'll sort things out later. - I am fine without it. Hello, this is us. Tatarin wasn't there. How much the potatoes? One and a half thousand. How is your trade? Don't ask. This bandit and his fellows are looking for you. Listen, German, I need to rent a small room... ...in the center, something quiet. Ask yours, ah? Take it. Thanks. So have you found your brother? - Yes, I have. Who? - It is Zinka, open! What Zinka? Go away from here! Are you crazy, old man? Open! Zinka, I am telling you! Fool! Have lost your mind! What? What do you want? - I have brought a tenant. Take it! - And what do they go? Well, old man, have become mangy without me? Hey, listen, dear! Buy watermelon. Delicious? Surely! Look, just wonder! I ate seven yesterday myself. Myself. - OK. How much? - Six thousands. Oh, thank you! As you please! Ah! What is happening?! That man with watermelon! Maybe you need any help? Go, go! I will find you. It wasn't Tatarin, it was a young man. He did everything professionally. The Chechen is dead and he ran away. Took the yellow tram and went. I shot this skunk. He killed Shisha. Shisha? Was killed? I don't know exactly. He was taken to hospital. But why did you shoot, if it's not Tatarin? But I... We have to pay Tatarin anyway. Stupid asshole! And that that he killed Shisha was very good. We won't be suspected. Well, Tatarin! 'His life is hung by a thread, but he thinks about profit! ' You have to be taken to hospital. I can't go to hospital, German. OK, German, we will break through. Zina! Zina! Oh, had I met you in 1943 in the environs of Kursk! Go away, fool, go! - Zina, come here. Get more strong vodka... ...and bandage, and this... ...streptocid. And antibiotics. And take something for the old man, ...for him not to bore. - OK. German, you are clever. Tell me, what do we live for? Oh, everyone decides for himself. There is a proverb: 'What is good for a Russian is deadly for a German.' So I live to disprove it. Do you have a girlfriend? What about Zinka? You've got in the eye because of her? All right. German, you are good man. The kiosk was closed. Why are you not going? Come on! What happened to your face? Husband. Maybe you need my help? No, I will be fine. Where is your fellow-traveller? Jumped at the corner of Srednyaya and 18. He was on for a long time. A long time. Why didn't you call the militia? Shoots neatly. Yes, that is. Look, be careful, if you lied me, I will punish you. 'Not the one who is rich is happy... ...but another who has got a faithful wife.' Good afternoon. Where were you? A new CD of Nautilus has come out. Is called "Yablokitai". All sold out. But there's something else. OK. Tatarin? It's me. We have to meet. I've got business. Who did this? Ah, my husband. When he was drunk. They were looking for you. I told them that you had jumped at Srednyaya. How is your wound, closed up? - Yes, all right. I'd like to eat! Let's go to my place. What about your husband? 'He's overeaten pears.' What is your name? - Danila. My name is Sveta. This is "play". This is "stop". Rewind back and forward. This is "volume". Did you understand? Did you? Give me the phone. - What? Phone. - Neighbours will pick it up. Give me to call! Me to call! Husband? Tell me. - I don't want! Hello! Hello, brother. Get me the money, OK? Danila!

Will smoke as adults? Here you are, call me. Is she your mother? - No. Ah, OK, bye. Who is this sucker? - An acquaintance. Brother, you did well. Helped me and many people. Only Russian people will trade now. What about the Germans? - What Germans? Will Germans trade? - What Germans? Well, the Germans. - Why the Germans? Brother, I have a proposition to you, ...let's start the firm "Bagrov Brothers". Sounds good? No, tell me do you like it? What are we going to do? - Business. Everything in general. But there is one problem - a competitor. Kruglyi. This is his nickname. Ah? Well surprise. Surprise! Ah? Can I come over? Is it possible to listen to your CDs here as well? Yes. Where is "play" button here? - It is green. What is it? This is Nautilus live in concert. Anniversary. Very rare. I have got it. There are Shevchuk, Kinchev, Nastya - everybody. Yes. No. I can't today. I am resting. I said no. Well. I don't have time to talk to you! That's it! Bye! Husband? - Ah? No, my friend at work asked to replace her. Rat, gave me a bad copy! Where did you serve? At headquarters. Who are you? - I am Danila, and who are you? Me? Pavel Eugrafovich. And where is Svetka? Svetka? She is out. And you, Pavel Eugrafovich, listen to me very carefully. Now you give me the key. And will forget number of this house... ...and the phone number for ever. Understand? Ah, fucker!

What are they singing about? It's not all the same for you? Singing well. I don't like it. He likes Nautilus, stupid. Your american music is shit. Well, why are you arguing? I told you your music is shit yet you argue. And you all are... Soon your America will fall away. We'll get you all. Do you understand? Why did you bore him? He is the French. Let's go. What is the difference? Do you have contraceptives? - What for? Why 'what for? ' Do you think ...I will give you money? Ah, Zhanna has. What are you doing? - To sober up. Well what about you? Let's go! Hello! - Dania? Help, brother! I got ill. You have to come and sort this out urgently. Yes, just behind Pribaltiyskaya hotel, ...on Vasilievskiy, at five o'clock. "Volvo" will be there, two guys in it. They will tell you everything. They are brainless, but you look out there for yourself. Brother, as for me, I am brainless too. I have a headache. I can't. Brother! If you won't help me I'll die. Help! It is a part of our common business. I can't talk on the phone, Dania, understand? Take everything with you. Do not think about money. Help, brother! OK. How do you do, bandits! We found this skunk only yesterday. He is tough. Was hiding for almost half of the year. He's back now. Lives at his friend's house.

We wait for one fellow, ...we will talk, then we will let you go. If anything's wrong, bitch, I will shoot you in the eye. Do you have a tablet from headache, Stepa? No, I don't? - It is a pity.
