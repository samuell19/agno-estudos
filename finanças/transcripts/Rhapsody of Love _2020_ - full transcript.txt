Hey, sis? Uh huh? Have you finished writing? Yeah, I got it out last night. I hope he likes it. You know, I think Ben's the one that got away. I don't feel for Ben that way anymore. Well, I think it's great that he made you best man. Best woman. Oh, okay, that's my car. - Hello, how are you? - Hi, I'm okay! Ooh, love the frill, you know? Oh, the rings, oh! I got it, I got it. - You got it? - Yep. Get in. Whoa. - Gonna need all that. - Yes, you are. Thank you. Can you, can you drive this beautiful beast a little bit faster? Thank you! Okay, phew. Almost lost you but I didn't. Okay. Enjoy your night. Thank you! - See you later. - Bye. Excuse me, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Made it. I think I'm having an anxiety attack. Okay, keep smiling, keep breathing. Um. I don't think I can do this, Jess. Yes you can, yes you can. Okay. Breathe in. I dwell in the present moment. I dwell in the present moment. Breathe out. Knowing it's a wonderful moment. Knowing it's a wonderful moment. Okay, Ben, Ben, Ben. Look at me. Hi. Hi. Do you love her? Do you love her? Yes, I do, Jess. I love her so much. Do you wanna marry her? With all my heart. Good, good. Okay, breathe in. Breathe out. Okay, here she comes. I love you. Please be seated. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to the wedding of Benjamin Lin, and Natasha Booker. We're not just here to witness their commitment to each other, but also to witness my debut as a wedding celebrant. G'day, my name's Andrew. I'm not a trained reverend or rabbi, but I can in fact play one. That's right, I'm a trained actor. And for those of you who don't really know me, you really ought to. Today is a chance, a chance for us to remember love isn't simply happily ever after, it's a reminder of our story, and creating that story. You two met in the library, where you mistook Natasha for a librarian. Yes, I've been wearing glasses ever since. Now, if there's anyone here today who wishes these two not to be wed, please speak now or forever hold your bits. That's a good sign. Benjamin Lin, do you take Natasha Booker to be your wife, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer or in poorer, and when she steals that last piece of apple pie out of the fridge, as long as you both shall live? I do. Excellent. Natasha Booker, do you take Ben Lin to be your husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer or in poorer, and when he launches himself on that next business adventure, and grows a beer gut, as long as you both shall live? I do. Excellent. May we have the rings? Thank you. Okay. These rings are a symbol of your everlasting love and devotion to one another. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for Mr. and Mrs. Lin. This cake is amazing. Aw. It expresses love and romance. This, this is how wedding cakes should be made. Are you serious? Yeah. You don't think so? No, no, no. I, I do think so. I actually made this cake. Really? Yes. Oh, I love your work. What, what do you do? I run a creative PR agency with my sister Jade. - Oh my God. - Mm hmm. Oh, I actually know you guys. Yeah, Ben's told me all about you. You're- - Blooming Success Media. By the flower sisters. Yeah, that's us. Thank God. Oh my God. I am, I actually kind of need you. Yeah, I, I really love what you said about my cake, and I feel like you guys would be the perfect people to help launch my business, and make it a blooming success. We'd love to. Oh my God! I'm gonna add you on social media. Let's do it now. Let's pull it out. - Yeah, that's- - That one? That's it, yep. Okay. And added. Oh, cool. Mm. Hello, lovely ladies. Wow, you have beautiful eyes. Oh. Can I get you a glass of red or bubbly? I'm currently bubbly enough, so I'm, I'm probably gonna have a red, please. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. And you? I don't drink so- - Okay, I can get you a juice, and maybe my number. I'll have your number. Oh, damn it. I forgot, I've, I've got a boyfriend. Oh, I hate when that happens. Me too. I got an idea. Why don't we go and find him together, and bring him a glass of wine, Together? Yeah. Maybe next time. What's your name? Hugh. Sorry, what? Hugh, as in humongous. Oh, is it really? - Yes. - Wow. But also a humongous heart. Oh! Lovely to meet you, Humongous Heart. Lovely to meet you too. I'll let you guys go off together. Sure, and I'll bring you back an orange juice perhaps? Thank you. Yeah, we should probably go. Jess, cool. It was, it was so nice to meet you, Jess. I'm gonna be in touch, and maybe we could, we could probably tee up a meeting tomorrow. - Okay, fine. - Okay, see you. I caught you. It's all on camera. I was placing the flower- - In your mouth? It was drooping. What? Your mouth was drooping? Okay, my mouth was drooping. How much was it drooping by? No, it was way droopier than that. No, I think it was more like, wait, hold this for a second. Hmm. Oh, oh, show me again. Hmm. Ooh, so handsome. - Best drooping flower. - That's how you droop. Justin, are you torturing my best man? Oh no, no, no. She was torturing me, dude. He started it. No, she did. She's crazy, man. Oh, excuse me. Look at that face. That face is trouble. Mm. Um, anyway, Ben. So, why didn't you ask me to be your best man? Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech. Saved by the speeches. Please be gentle, Jess. And miss the opportunity to embarrass you in front of all your friends? Good evening, folks. I'm here to talk about my beautiful daughter, Natasha. We all know her love for books and writing. Her father, rest in peace, always supported her creative endeavors to become a writer, so much so, that he funded her first online magazine called "It's a Barking Dog's Life." She then proceeded to date some strays. I think there might be one here tonight. So, after dating those mutts, she fell in love with Shakespeare, and became a literature teacher, which is one step up from being an unemployed writer. Then she met Ben in the library, when he was studying his bachelor of business. Ben, I know my daughter loves you, and I hope you'll grow old together, like her late father and I did. Welcome to the family. Thank you. Cheers! Tash, I am so sad to be the one to tell you that you are not Ben's first and only true love. Ben's first true love was Rex. Yes, Rex. Rex, his Teddy bear, who fortunately cannot be here tonight. So, Ben and I became best friends in school because we spent time in detention more than anyone else, me, because I was always late, and Ben, because he was always, always talking. And so, you know, we're in detention, watching "Cosmic Sky Girl," and Ben was always like, "I'm gonna marry that girl one day." And he did. Tash, you are strong, fiercely intelligent, absolutely beautiful, sensitive, caring, interesting. You know what, you're actually much more than Cosmic Sky Girl. So, thank you for loving and choosing Ben. It was a good choice. And Ben, what can I say? Thank you for being my family. I love you both so much and I wish you so much happiness. Please raise your glasses to Natasha and Ben. Natasha and Ben. To Natasha and Ben! Cheers! Hey, Jess! I know you're single. Get up there! Come on, Jess! Are you ready? Okay, okay, okay. One, two, three! Nice work out there catching the bouquet. Better than my drooping mouth? Hmm, nothing beats your drooping mouth. Okay, maybe a little bit better. Well, it was tough competition up there, fighting that crowd. Think I'm still sweating. Well, you know what? It makes great material for Ben and Tasha's wedding video. Oh, oh, it's really good. This is where I got you. - Yeah, yeah, I can see that. - Ha ha! I can see that. Okay, put that away. This is the best part. Oh, oh, don't show me that, don't. Show me some of Ben and Tash. Aw. Oh wow, they look so happy. It's really nice work. Thank you. Hey, I think I gotta go. I think I'm really drooping now. It was lovely to meet you, Justin. And you too, Miss...? Sorry, what's your surname? It's not Drooping is it? It is. How did you know? Oh. I don't know, I think I'm psychic or something. Flowers. Jessica Flowers. Okay, well, it was lovely meeting you, Jessica Flowers. - Mm hmm. - Oh. - Um, oh. - Um. Um, okay. Um. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Oh, wait, Miss Flowers? Forgetting something? I'm gonna need that. Thank you. Welcome. Okay, bye. Bye. Hey. Thanks for looking after Vic for me. Yeah, no worries. Come on, babe. - Ugh, Justin. - Alright? Come on, that's it. It's alright, I got you. I'm gonna vomit. It's okay. Hello? Jade! Oh, sorry, did I wake you? No, I'm just resting my eyeballs. Okay, great. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. Oh my God, the wedding was so beautiful, Jade. Ben and Natasha, they are so meant for each other. Um, and I met the cake maker. She wants to meet us in the morning. Oh, that's great. Did you meet anyone special? There was an interesting guy called Justin. But how was the media conference? Oh, it was great. They really like our work. Oh, great. Mm. I have to go. I have my first training session with Phil tomorrow morning. Training session? Wow, it's about time you got rid of that belly cushion. Hey, speak for yourself. Actually, you're right. But you know what? I love my belly cushions. So, many things I can do with my belly cushion. You know, I can put my plate in it, and eat it, and no hands here! Wish you could see me. Anyway, I'm, I'm sitting back up. But I'll see you tomorrow morning? Don't forget the awards dinner tomorrow night. Hmm, I won't. Anyway, I'll let you go. I'll see you in the morning. Night. Love you. Bye. Mm. Okay, so pain in the gut. Just breathe in, breathe out, breathe. Once you get the hang of it, that's extreme fit, Jade. Okay, now I want you to remember, look around at your office furniture, and visualize, I want you to visualize your office furniture as your workout friends. Just visualize them. Visualize. I have enough friends, thank you, Phil. I mean, how much more is there to do? We've used the vases as weights, the office furniture as part of the circuit. What more is there? See this desk? You don't want me to lift that, do you, Phil? No, no, Jade. Lean on it. Oh, like this? Very funny, Jade. No, we're gonna work your arms, okay? So they don't wave about. Wave about? Uh huh, yeah. Do this. Yeah, I can do that. That's it. Easy. It's fun. Wave, wave, wave, wave. I could hang my whole washing on those arms. A whole load. You really know how to make a woman feel good, Phil. Yeah, well you will do once I'm done with you, Jade. So, just remember the focus fights the flab always. So, just place your hands like this, on a right angle. We're gonna start with five, okay? - Yeah. - So, come on. Five, yeah, four, yeah, three, yeah, two. Come on, you can get two! One! You got it, yes! - So amazing. - Really? - Yeah. - Thank you. Saved by my next client. Okay, well that's it for today. Next time, I'll introduce you to your new friends at the gym. Hi. Okay. Hi! Okay, try one. Wow. Jade, you gotta try one. My goodness. Oh my gosh. It's so good. Thank you. So, how did you get started? Well, I gave samples to boutique cafes, and they took a chance on me. And then people started to take selfies with my cakes, which inspired me to create Cup Famous. But I don't know, I feel like we could take this to the next level. Yeah, that's why you're here. Cool. And what's this made from? Oh, so that's rice paper that you can print on with edible ink. So, I checked your social media following. 11K followers. - No, no, real followers. - Yeah. That's important. So, Jade and I, we can bring it up to 150K in six months. Oh my God, really? Shut the front door! Seriously? Oh my God! The door is shut. Look, this is a really good idea. I'm gonna make a few calls and get you on "The Morning Show with Kiki." Great idea. "The Morning Show with Kiki"? Mm hmm. Oh my God, I gotta be dreaming. Are you serious? Mm. Okay, pinch me! Pinch me, hurry up. Okay. Harder! Yes! Okay, I'm back in the room. Guys, thank you so much. I am beyond grateful for this opportunity. I think we need to go and celebrate. With more cupcakes? Yes! Well, you two go. I really wanna get started on this. - Sure. - Okay. Okay, we'll leave this with you, okay? Okay. Oh, I'll take one. See you! - To new beginnings, - Mm hmm. and new friendships. And living your dreams. Mm hmm, ooh. Oh, that was a big cheers. Mm? - What? - Your cupcakes? Yes, my cupcakes. You're gonna do so well. No, we are gonna do so well. We are. Yes we are. We are! A million followers. At least. At least. Tash, what's this? It's a wedding gift from me. Oh no, I forgot. I'm so, so, so sorry. It's just, I'm in the middle of launching my new business, and it's taking up all of my mental space. I'm such an idiot. I forgot my wife's present. I'll run out and get something now. Honey, honey, it's fine. I understand. Just open it. "Cosmic Sky Girl." Oh my goodness, Tash. I haven't seen this since school. I know how much you love her and me. I do. How much did this cost me? Nothing that you have to worry about until next month. I feel so bad. I just, I didn't get you anything. I knew you were busy, so I bought myself a gift from you. Aren't I thoughtful? Yes, you are. And thank you for outbidding the highest bidder of $2000. Bargain price, usually with its original jacket, $4000. And I have expensive taste too. Thank you for my beautiful wedding gift. Now, I really must get back to work. Oh! To pay for our wedding gifts. So, you don't wanna see the second gift I got you under this dress? Hi guys, it's Victoria Steer here. I'm just gonna tell you about my amazing cupcake range that I'm about to launch. It's called Cup Famous. It's gonna be incredible. So, it's this idea where you can get your- - Hey. - Hi! So, this is my boyfriend, Justin. Anyway, guys. So excited to tell you all about it. I'll give details. Love you guys. - Hey, can you not? - Wait, what? I'm like in the middle of live streaming. Okay. Yeah. Is there something burning? Oh my God, oh my God. Oh, sugarcane! I'm gonna have to do another batch. We haven't got time. We've gotta get going, okay? What? Sorry. Oh my God. She wants me. She actually wants me on her show. I can't believe this. Oh my God. Babe, that's great. But we gotta get going. What, going where? Where are we going? To my pre-festival dinner? Oh, your pre festival dinner. Um. You forgot. No, no, no. I definitely did not forget. Listen, I'm really sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to go. It's just that I have to prepare, and well, your amazing girlfriend is gonna be on "The Morning Show with Kiki." Okay, who's Kiki? Who's Kiki? Are you serious? It's the show. The morning show I watch every morning. Yeah. "It's Kiki time!" Don't touch that! Okay. Sorry. Okay, why are you on the show? - Why am I on the show? - Yeah. You serious? Because I'm launching my new cupcake range, yeah? I've got new brand marketing management. I'm gonna be on national TV. National. I don't have time for this. I've gotta get ready. Okay, fine, yeah? I'm just gonna go myself, okay? Hey, Justin? Have you seen my selfie stick? - No. - No, okay. We're good. Hey, sis. Hey. Aren't you late for opening night? Oh! I'm trying to write an acceptance speech in case we win and I just can't get it out. It's like I've got chronic writer's constipation. You've got a few days to do it. You got plenty of time. Ask me to visually rebrand a company, and I can do that while brushing my teeth. But this, this is, this is why you're the writer. Hey, you look tired. Let me make you some liquorice tea. - You can't. - Yeah. You're running late, sis. You gotta go. You gotta make a move on. Okay, okay. Well, have some of my tea. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Welcome to Sydney's first Short-E-Short Film Festival. Jess! Humongous Heart. Yeah. What are you doing here? Oh, the catering company gave me this last minute job, so. You do this often? Yeah, whenever the events or restaurants are short on staff. Hey, would you like an orange juice? I finally get my orange juice. Yeah, I'm really sorry about that. I was a bit distracted. Well, better late than never. Enjoy. Thank you. Wow. Oh, take it easy tonight with that, love. Oh, no, it's orange juice. Uh huh, that's what they all say. Says, "It's only orange juice." But I bet there's a big dash of vodka or gin, just like mine. It's okay, love. You're secret is safe with me. My name's Steve, by the way. Jessica. Nice to meet you. Is it now, very nice to meet me? I mean, don't be too hasty. We've only just met. But I think it's bloody marvelous you think so. Cheers. So, do you have a film selected for the Sydney Short-E-Shorts? No, I'm just here for the free food. Mm hmm, okay. No, just playing. My sister and I, we have a film in. Oh, good. So, is she here with you tonight? No, she has other commitments, unfortunately. - Oh. - Hmm. Yeah, don't we all. So, have you met Will yet? Yes, I, no, no. Um, so, what is your, I think your orange juice might be having an effect already. Yes, I know who you're talking about, but no, I haven't met him. Right, well I'm glad you cleared that up. Maybe he's just behind the scenes somewhere. I bet this is the late joker now. No, this is Justin. Hi, Jessica. Nice to see you again. Here we go again. It's all very nice, isn't it? Steve, meet Justin. It's very nice to meet you, Justin. Likewise. Oh, excuse me for being rude. I see my better half's just arrived. I'll catch you two later. What's up with him? Too much orange juice and vodka, I think. Shall we find a seat? Yeah. - After you. - Okay. So, are you two following us? It's your secret orange juice, isn't it? - Mm. - Mm hmm, up to no good? Mm hmm. Allow me to introduce my better half, Jill. Jill, this is Justin and Jessica. Hi Justin, hi Jessica. Nice to meet you. - Oh God, here we go again. - Hi, Jill. They could be horrible. We've only just met them. Oh, Steve, shush. See, she shushed me. After 30 years of marriage, that's what you can expect. Oh, oh, here's something that might shush me. Oh, yep. What have you got there? So, I didn't know you made short films. Well, that's because you drooped and went home, and didn't ask me. Some balls for you, Justin. And some sausages for you. Eat them while they're warm. They're really small. Those are. Oh, yeah, where were we? You were telling me about your short film. Oh yeah, so it's called "Wedding Disasters," and it's a documentary of all the mishaps at weddings I've filmed throughout the years. So, that's why you came to me at the end of Ben's wedding, to capture my lonely footage. Guilty as charged. But do you know what? Mm? That was more of a single person disaster, rather than a wedding disaster. Maybe I'll make a doco called The Disasters of Being a Singleton, and you can be my star. Disasters of Being a Singleton? I don't think there are any in this time and age. I know couples who are together and they are not happy. You should make a documentary about that, mm. Yeah, good point. So, what fun moments did you capture in your film? Hmm. Oh yeah, so this one time, this sausage dog ran around the table, and it started to, wait, it started chewing the guy's foot off. And his face went up to like, buh! You had to be there. It's like, yeah. I think you'll have a winner. Oh. Yeah, tell me about your film. Oh, so my sister and I, we made this film, a one minute film. It's about a woman who goes on a one minute search for like this thing, and it's so funny! Searching for what? I can't tell you. It's a secret. Okay. Well, did you write it? No, my sister did. But I hope to be a script writer one day. So, what's stopping you? I... So, where's Willy? Yes, where is he? The organizers of the first Sydney Short-E-Shorts, and he's a no show. I heard that he had to ask one of the filmmakers here, to help him with tomorrow night's screening. Oh, look at the time. Time for my beauty sleep. It's after 9:30. We'll say goodnight. Good night. - See you. - Good night. I think I might go get some beauty sleep as well. Thanks for walking me. No worries. Hey. Hey. How was the evening? It was good. But Will, the organizer, didn't even show up. What? He didn't even show up? Oh my God. That is like highly unprofessional. Yeah, maybe he got caught up somewhere. Maybe. Are you coming to the screening of my short film? Oh. Shoot. You forgot again. No, no, I definitely didn't forget. Look, I'm gonna be baking all morning, and then I'm gonna be on "The Morning Show with Kiki," and I don't know, I just feel like I'm gonna be really tired after everything. Okay. I'm sorry. It's just like, it's kind of my time to shine. It's so nice to finally be home. Ooh! Ah! Thank you, Mrs. Lin. And thank you, Mr. Lin. Now, it's back to reality and launching my new business. - Mm. - Hm. Back to finishing my thesis on creativity in political theater. Oh, and back to teaching next week. Hey, maybe we could go to Canberra for our real honeymoon and watch "Question Time." What? Well, that's creative political theater for you. Yeah, it sure would be. But I only have two weeks to finish it. Well, you can do it. My baby can do anything. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry, Tash. It's work. Oh. Hi, Samuel, what's happening? Yeah, I just got back. Friday's good, mm hmm. I'll see you then. Bye. Everything all good? Mm hmm. Camera's set. Alright, guys, we're on in five, four, And we're back to "The Morning Show with Kiki."

It's great to have you here today. Oh my God, I love your display! Oh! Sorry, sorry, Kiki. I, I'm a bit of a "Morning Show" virgin. - It's my first time. - That's okay, Vic. Don't worry about it. We've all been there, let me tell you, So, why don't you tell me about your beautiful display here? Okay, well it's called Cup Famous, and you can get your face printed on our cakes, just like the one - I have of you here. - Ooh. Oh my gosh. Don't I look absolutely delicious? I'm gonna have a taste right now. - Yes, go for it. - I'm doing it. I'm going in for it. Ready, okay? Mm. Mm, mm! Well, that tastes pretty damn good too. - Good? - Yeah, that's amazing! - Mm! - Cool. So, it's edible paper, I believe? Yes, and, and we, we use edible ink. That's an amazing idea. And already, your take home cake mixes are available at selected supermarkets. Yes, that's right. But I'm looking forward to expanding my business to major food chains in the future. Fingers crossed! Fantastic. And I'm sure after today you will. So, where can we purchase Cup Famous? Oh, well, on my website And the link to Cup Famous is listed there. Get on it. Can I hug you? - Yeah, you can hug me! - Okay. - I'm gonna keep right on - That's Kiki! eating this. And cut. Ah! That was such successful launch for Victoria. And now, a rom-com night, paying homage to my favorite rom-com women, with my favorite sister. Your only sister. Well, there you go. So, choose a movie, sis. - Any movie you like. - Oh, me? I get to choose tonight? Yeah. Mm, okay. Oh, how about this one? "How to Lose a Guy in a Minute." Mm hmm. Great choice. Mm hmm. But I actually watched this last night. But I'm happy to watch it again, sis. No, no, we'll pick another one. Okay. Ooh, what's this? Ooh, okay, I love this one. "Crazy Middle Class Asians." Mm hmm. Oh, I actually promised to watch this with a friend on the weekend. But if I wear a bed mask, I can listen to it, and you can watch it and- - Silly. Pick us something else. Okay, ooh, this is really good. Oh, not my favorite. Not my favorite. Hey, I've got a really good idea, why don't you choose? No, we choose one together. No, no, you can. Oh, oh, together, together? What's this? - "The Script of Life." - Mm. Oh, my favorite! Great choice, sis. - Great choice. - Yes. Let's go. Yeah, I'm really good at choosing. Okay. Come on! Yeah! Oh, you beat me. "Marathon man." "Marathon man," 1976. Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier. So, you remember? How could I forget? It's the film we studied together at uni. Film studies 101. Then you changed to a business degree. There's no money in film. Still love it though, you know that. Yeah, me too. Just can't get enough of it. Speaking of filming, thanks for shooting the wedding. What do I owe you? No, man, it's my wedding gift to you. Wow, really? It's a lot of work in that. I'm sure, man. The footage is great. But Tash and I did notice there was this extra footage of Jess. Well, look at that. Have to be somewhere. Catch you later, man. Mrs. Lin. Hey, Tash, let's hit the sack. Honey, I'm going to bed? Are you joining me? Are you gonna clear all this? Ben! I can't believe you just did that. I'm right in the middle of writing this chapter, and I have only two weeks to submit this. And least now I have your undivided attention. Oh, it's not funny, Ben. You know, lately, it's just been a one-way street around here. What do you mean by that? It's been all about you, launching your new business, your new career. What about me? You know I don't wanna be a literature teacher my entire life. I want to be writer. And maybe just one day, my thesis will be published. Tash, writers don't earn much unless they're JK Rowling. At least I can say that I tried. At least I can say that I gave it my best shot to live out my dreams, just like you're living out yours. I'm sorry, Tash. Look, Ben, just, just go to bed. I'm finishing this chapter. Ladies and gentlemen, please take a seat. The Short-E-Short Film Festival is about to begin. Hi. Hi, guys. Any sign of our friend Willy on the way in? No, I didn't see him. He's not here tonight? Who's running this show? Nice to see you again, Jessica Flowers. You remembered. Of course. That was, that was actually good. Yeah. Yours was great. No, I liked yours better. Smile for the camera, guys. Closer. A little bit closer. Okay. Short-E-Short memories. Thanks. No, no, no, you actually put that under your armpit like that. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay. So, am I seeing you tomorrow night? Yes, we'll be here. You too lovebirds enjoy the rest of your evening. No, we're just friends. Uh huh. Hey. Hey, do you wanna get some food? Um, okay. Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. Yeah. So, you're from Melbourne, right? Yeah, yeah. I moved from Melbourne after finishing film school, and moved all the way here to Sydney. And just started my business, and follow my passions now. That's great. What do you love most about your work? Hmm. I love creating memories. You know, weddings isn't just about the bride and groom getting married, it's about creating memories, so when they grow old or when they start fighting, I want them to look back at the memories and remember why they loved each other. Oh, I love that. Yeah? What about you, Jess? What are your passions? So many passions, but there's one thing left that I wanna do, which is to write a script. And I, I just feel like I can't write anything that's meaningful or... It's just, it feels too hard. I have no idea- - Hey, hey, hey. I gotta get going. Yeah, me too. I'll see tomorrow, okay? Justin? You forgot something. - Bye! - Bye. Hey! Did you see me on "The Morning Show with Kiki"? Yeah, I caught a bit of it. Yeah? What did you think? I was terrible, wasn't I? - You can just say it. - No, no. - Be honest. - It was good, it was good. No, I was bad. I like froze there like this woman Popsicle. It was, it was weird, and, I mean, I'm deeply embarrassed. No, no. You did fine, okay? - Really? - Yeah. Aw, thank you. That's so sweet. Oh, hey, did you end up doing the second round of photos for me? They're due tomorrow? Look, no pressure, but they are due tomorrow. And my day was really good, and the screening was amazing. Thanks for asking, Vic. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Look, my head's just been in a million pieces at the moment. How was your day? Was it good? You know, I very rarely ask anything of you. What? What do you even mean by that? Come on! No, just actually talk to me. I feel like I'm just in your way. In my way? Well, I have never once said that, so that's completely untrue. Don't worry about it, forget it. What do you mean "Don't worry about it"? No, talk to me! I wanna know. Do you even think of me as your boyfriend? Course I think of you as my boyfriend! Well, feels like I'm just here for your own convenience. That's not true. Look, this is my business. You know? This is everything I've been working for ages. I don't really wanna let this moment pass. You know, I know your business's important to you, just like how my business is important to me. By the way, I finished Photoshopping. Check your inbox. I need some space. Okay. Oh, how's the guests list looking? Oh, sorry, I'll call you back. Hey, come in. G'day, Samuel? Yeah, you must be Ben. Thanks for covering for me. No worries, mate. Oh, how was your honeymoon? Yeah, it was great, thanks. So, almost my big launch. Yeah. You still going on live? I'm not sure. If you like, we could set up a screen and you could be connected via video link, or we could do a pre-record. Up to you. Okay. Yeah, that's something to consider. Leave it with me. I'll have a think about it. Okay. Thanks, mate. You got this. Yeah, I'm back. Cool. Oh, what's for lunch? What is it like being a hubby? It's good. It's just... Just? It's good overall, it's just- - Okay. Hey, guys. Oh, it's good to see you. Hey, man. Thanks for helping out with my wedding. No worries, man. Thanks for booking me through the events agency. You're welcome. Did they get you this gig? Yeah, yeah. They've been getting me lots of work lately. Lots of local hire jobs like this. Oh, Hugh, sorry, this is Jess. Hello, Humongous. You remembered! How could I forget? Wow. Can I order? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not on the menu. Oh, too bad. Private, private joke, man. How about pho ga, thank you. Mot pho ga. Ben? I'll just have a big pho bo tai. Humongous it is. It's good to see you. Hugh really likes you. He likes everyone. Go for it. Mm, back to you and Natasha. Look, the honeymoon was great. It's just that since we've been back, we've had our first, we've had our first post-wedding fight, you know? We butt heads the other night. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, but you know what? It's part of life. It's okay. She wants me to be more supportive of her career, and I thought she was happy being a literature teacher. She isn't? No, she wants to be a writer. Go on. You and I both know that unless you're a JK Rowling, writers earn crap nothing. Did she say she wanted to be a JK Rowling? No, she said she wants to be a published author. She wants her thesis to be published. Ben, you're living your dreams. She wants to live hers. Have you been speaking to her recently? No, why? Because that's more or less what she said. Well, what can I say? Two power brain ladies think alike. Hey, just trust her, and give her the freedom to do what she loves, hmm? Here you are, guys. Ooh! Thank you. Thanks, mate. No worries. Wow, looks good. Look at this. Humongous has left you his number. Hoo, that boy is persistent. You know, Ben, I met someone, and we kissed last night. Who? Justin. From my wedding? Mm hmm. Oh no, he has a girlfriend. You know her, it's Victoria Steer. Sorry, what? Oh, that's awkward. You know, I know Justin. He doesn't just randomly kiss people. I don't really know Victoria, but you know, maybe it was an accident or something. Ben, why don't you have some of my pho ga. I'm just gonna be excused for a moment, okay? I got you something. Thanks, Vic. So, are you still coming tomorrow? Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Look, I think I'm just gonna have so many orders after "The Morning Show with Kiki" and, you know, it's just gonna be really hectic. It's just two or three hours of your time, Vic. This is a huge opportunity for me, and I really don't wanna miss out. Take it then. You know what? The way I see it, is that you don't really need me for anything except for photos and Photoshopping. When have I ever once said that? You don't have to. What? What is even going on between us? Because it kind of feels like, it kind of feels like you don't even love me anymore. Me? I don't love you? The question is do you? Do you still love me? Well, you don't seem to be happy for any of my successes. No, 'cause you would much rather me to be sitting in some corner, where you have all the success and all the glory. No, that's not true. Well, it kind of feels like that. You know what, we're not doing this. Walk away, okay? Walk away like you always do. Do you remember when we used to stay up late and talk about our passions and hobbies? Yeah. I want that. I really want that. You found your passion in your cupcakes. And I want that passion too, with a woman, with a woman that really wants me for me. You know what? What? I think you're right, Vic. Right about what? Do you still love me? Because it's okay if you don't. I'm sorry. You don't hate me do you? I still care for you. I think we're finally on the same page. Yeah. I think so too. What the hell, man? What happened to a bit of friendly jogging? I saw Jess yesterday. She didn't know you were with Vic. And you kissed her. What are you doing, man? I'm not with her anymore. We broke up. Because of Jess? Yes. No! I mean, Vic and I weren't right for each other. She's way too in to herself. But you had no right to tell Jess about me and Vic. Yeah, you should have. If you really like her, you should go and see her. Straighten things out with her. I will. I really like her. When I'm with her, it feels like I'm at home. Are you and Tash good? Yeah. It's a bit tricky. You know, she comes from money, and she sure does love spending it. I'm just doing my best as a husband to support her. I love her, man. Tash, what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Cleaning. Oh, good. Your glasses must be clean. Tash, if you wanna have your books and your papers all over the place, I'm okay with that. No, you need to sleep. No, but you need to study and finish your thesis. Come on. Come on, Mrs. Lin, let's go to bed. Where were you earlier when I tried to call? Catching up with Jess. In fact, she said exactly the same thing you did. Which is? That you deserve to follow your dreams of becoming a writer, a published author. I'm so sorry I didn't see that. I really am, Tash. I love you. More than Cosmic Sky Girl? Oh! Get rid of these. Spinning is winning, Paul. Spinning is winning. Crack that pace, champion! Crack that pace. Okay, Jade, see that? You can match it, you can match it now. You can do this. Power the tower, baby. Faster, come on, faster! Power that tower. Power that tower, baby! - Pain, breathe, achieve! - Yeah! Yeah! Oh. Oh, whiskers. Are you okay? Are you okay? Jade? Hi, Jess. I can't go tonight. Why? I sprained my ankle. Oh, are you okay? Like, what happened? I was exercising with Phil, and he said to go "Faster, faster, faster," and I did. Sorry, you cut off. You what? I slipped. I can't hear you. I slipped! Are you laughing at me? No, no, no, I'm, no. I'm laughing with you. But I'm not laughing. You know what, I'll come and pick you up. No! It's okay, I'm with Phil. He's gonna drive me home now. Ooh, Phil, huh? Shh, you're on loud speaker. Hi, Jessica! Hi. Hi, Phil. Nice to meet you. I've heard so many awful things about you. Let me speak to her. I'm passing you to Phil. Be nice, be nice. You know, I told your sister to make friends with the gym equipment, not to to fall for them, if you know what I mean? Well, just take good care of her, 'cause she's the only one I got. Yeah, I'll do my best, but she's a tough cookie to crack. Oh, and don't mention cookies, 'cause they're responsible for her muffin top. - Yeah. - Give it, here. Hey, Jess? Have you written your speech in case we win tonight? No, I haven't. Jess, you gotta be positive, you know? You could be out celebrating with Justin tonight. Justin and I will not be celebrating, because Justin has a girlfriend. What? And it's Victoria Steer. Good evening. You look lovely tonight, Jill. And you look very handsome and different. Yeah, did you score last night? No, it was actually better than that. Have you guys seen Jess? I need to talk to her. I think she's gone for orange juice. So she said. Okay. Good evening, folks, and welcome to Sydney's first Short-E-Short Film Festival. The first award for the evening is best shortest short, films one minute and under. And the nominees are "My Life as a Dog," Steve Edmunds. "It Takes Three," Norm Harvey. And "3101," Sarah Townsend. I'd like to thank you all for entering this year's Short-E-Shorts Awards. Man, why can't I do this? Ben, is that you? Dammit. Ben, it's alright, dude. Come on. It's my bloody anxiety. How can I help you? Please go and get my wife. Where's Natasha? Where's my wife? Did you hear me? Yeah, man, I'll find her, okay? Just hold on, okay? It was good, yours was. - Thank you. - Everyone's was. Yeah, I just need to borrow you for a second. Hey. And the winner is Steve Edmunds for "My Life as a Dog." Steve, please come on the stage. Ben, Ben? Hey, hey, hey, Tash isn't here. Hey, hey, look at me. Okay, deep breath in. Look at me. Okay, deep breath in. Justin, grab his hand. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay. Breathe in. Breathe out. Good. Deep breath in. Deep breath out. Deep breath in. Deep breath out. It's all good in theory, it's just executing it. I don't think I can do this. I can't believe this. So, your Will? I went under that alias in case my idea failed, and now it seems as though it has. Ben, you haven't failed. There's a crowd out there cheering and waiting for you. Yeah, I've seen the crowd, and I know I just can't face them. Ben, it'll be okay, mate. You're not alone, okay? You've got Jess and I. Mm hmm. We'll walk out with you, okay? People will wonder why I need chaperones. Who cares what people think. That's where people get it wrong in life, worrying about what others think. You're a sexy beast. You can do anything, okay? And don't you like your chaperones? Come on, let's do it. Okay, sexy beast, let's go, okay? Okay. Thank you for the award. Meatballs would be bloody wrapped if he was here tonight. I'd like to thank the judges, and the organizer, wherever he may be. I mean, where's Willy? Who is he? I mean, we really need to know. Fantastic. Thank you, Steve. I mean, he does he exist? Or maybe you're Will. I'm not. No, no, I'm Andrew, and we need the mic back now. Thank you, Steve. Everyone, Steve. Thank you. And here he is. He found us. Sydney's Short-E-Short founder, Will. Good evening, folks. I am the founder of Sydney's first Short-E-Shorts festival. My name is actually Ben. I went under the alias, Will, in case my idea failed. I suffer from anxiety, and tonight I am doing my best not to let it win. Hey, we make a pretty good team, don't we? Me, you, and your girlfriend? The judges have decided, - No, wait, Jess. - That this year's winner is "Wedding Disasters," Justin Judd. You should have told me. Jessica... Jess. Hi, everyone. Firstly, I'd like to thank the judges for voting for me, and Ben Lin for pulling this off. What an amazing achievement. "Wedding Disasters" is a labor of love, and I hope to continue doing what I love, because it's the rhapsody of love and friendships, that's most important in life. Thank you. Thank you, Justin. And that brings us to the end of tonight's event. Jess? Jess! Where on earth were you for my film festival? I was writing my thesis, you know that. I needed you there, and you couldn't just take two hours out of your day to come and support me. We only spoke about this just the other night, how it's always been about you lately. Always about me? Yes. Who's the one that's gone and spent 4000 bucks on our credit card? To buy us wedding gifts! Or have you forgotten that already? Jade, what are you doing? Oh, I'm so sorry, Jess. I thought it was just some lump that's grown in the middle of my couch the last two days, 11 hours and 45 seconds. Jade. Leave me alone, Jade. You don't understand. Understand? I understand. I've been there. And I vowed never to feel sorry for myself again. You know, Mum used to say never to feel sorry for yourself. "There's always someone," "in the world worse off than us." I know. I know, Jade. She told me that 50000 times, and so did you! I know. I know I'm supposed to be strong and get over it really quick. But it's different this time, Jade. I love him. I love him. I actually love him. And I can't be with him because of what he did. It's like having a home that you can't go to, Jade. Well, let it out. Why don't you write about it? That's why I've got so much material for my scripts. We're the flower sisters. We gotta keep blooming. Bloom, bloom, bloom, Jessica. Oh, that's what Mum used to do. I miss her. Well, I miss her too, you know? Yeah, I know. Okay, okay, I'll get up. - Seriously? - Okay. You gotta move. Okay, okay, I'll move, just- - Stop drooping on my couch! Okay, stop it, Jade. Stop it. I'll get up, okay? Can I droop on your floor? Okay. Ben! Hi, Jess. - Hey. - Can I come in? Yeah. Hey, come on. Cup of tea? No, I think I need something stronger than that. Whiskey? Count me in. There you go. Whoa, what's up? Natasha's left me. I need one too. And I think you need a second glass. Okay, drink up. I flipped out because she's been leaving the place looking like a rubbish tip. Plus, I got my credit card statement and there was this limited edition book on there for $2000. And so I showed it to her. A $2000 book, huh? She bought us both wedding gifts. Apparently the book was from me, and also got myself a box set of "Cosmic Sky Girl Two." "Cosmic Sky Girl"? You love "Cosmic Sky Girl. ♪ When you're afraid of the aliens ♪ ♪ Who do you call ♪ She knows what you love. We're just too different. Hmm, I know the way you guys look at each other. By the way, Justin asked me why you haven't been answering his calls. He's really into you, Jess. You know, he's broken up with Victoria. Look, Justin shouldn't have kissed me while he was still with Victoria. End of story. Jess, you are so stubborn. Get off your high horse and give the guy a chance. He kissed you because he listened to his heart. He's a good guy. It's not like he's ghosted you or he's married. He kissed you because his heart told him to. I think it's about time you started listening to yours. In fact, I can hear it now, calling. Bub bum, "Justin, Justin, Justin!" Yeah, got a smile out of you. She's doing alright. I heard she's even dating again. Really? You expecting someone? Hey. Justin. Oh. It's okay, mate. I was just about to leave. And I thought you said you were going soon, Ben? I feel partly responsible for this. Ben, please tell Jess, I just hope we can move forward. Justin hopes we can move forward. Well, tell Justin, I will think about it. What's to think about? Sorry. Justin, Jess will think about it. Come on, you two were made for each other. Justin's properly broken up now. You just need to get over yourselves. Make up and do something. I know, you two need to start making something. Wait, wait, slow down, mate. What'd you say? A film. Jess has started writing now. Hey, that's actually not a bad idea. How about it, Jess? Maybe if my sister Jade can produce? Done. I'm gonna go now. I'm gonna go now. Whoa. Here. I think he's out. Mm hmm. What's the number for 13cabs? I'll call them. God, you're heavy, Ben. You should go see Phil. Whoa. Okay, okay, okay. I got you, I got you. Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, watch your head. Okay, good boy. How you doing mate, how are you? - Hey mate. - Okay. - Got the address? - Yes. - Yes. - Okay. Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye! Playing with my guitar? I broke the G string. Sorry, I'll fix it for you, okay? Okay, you can fix it. Ben's gone. I thought he'd never leave. Mm hmm. So, are you still angry with me? I want to be, but I'm not. Good. Well, let's start again. Hi, I'm Justin. I'm a filmmaker. Tash... I remembered. I thought Tash was a librarian. My silly mistake was actually a blessing. And now she's a published writer. I'm so proud of her. I fell in love with Ben's warmth and kindness. I really love his humbleness, and the way he supports me in my career as a writer. It's exactly what it looks like. We're engaged. We are. He's funny, obviously, has this great sense of humor. As in humongous. Anyway, but for now, he's just opened Humongous Foodies. He also features my Cup Famous cakes, which are doing so, so well. A million followers in one year. It's all she's ever wanted. It's all I've, well, I've wanted other things. I've wanted you, from the moment I saw him! I do believe in love at first sight. It does actually happen. - It does. - Yeah. I'm so proud. Just, every time I look at you I fall in love. - Go on. - It's true. If there was gonna be someone I'd have a child with, a little mini cupcake, it would be, it would be Victoria. When I met Phil, I hated him. And it wasn't until the day that I actually slipped. - Breathe, achieve! - Yeah! Yeah! That he slipped into my heart. I just love you, Jade. You're the best. No, you are. So, when I first met Jess, she was a drooping flower. No, you were way droopier than that, babe. Yeah, that's about it. See, that's why I love her. She's so fun and she makes me feel like a better person each time. Lies, all lies. I love Justin's pure heart, his old fashioned charm, and the way he ties his shoe laces with so much care and detail. And to accept myself, and see the beauty of everything that comes to me. That's the rhapsody of love.
