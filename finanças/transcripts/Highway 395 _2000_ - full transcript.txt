I've been having a little family emergency. - I'll tell you when your family emergency started. The day your father died and Rupert quit his job. Now you should be looking to your father. And not to that low life brother of yours. He's leading you down a line of shit. Now you've been missing work more each week. - I know, I know. You gotta understand, okay? I mean things are making sense. All right it's like I'm going one way and I'm running smack, smack, into the other. It's like it's waiting there for me, you know. And I'm getting up by myself, and I know how things used to be. - [Man] What the hell are you talking about? - They used to make sense. - [Man] What are you talking about? - But now they're shredded. I can't hold on to it, you know. - Look at you. Are you on dope? - No, I'm just a little anxious. - You're on dope! You come up here to my work site, loaded on dope. Geez, idiot! You know what that stuff does to your brains? It turns it into a swirling mass of shit! Now get of here, get out of here! Go on, scram, get out of here.

I haven't got any money. - What? - Violet, there's no money. [mysterious music] - Rod, what the fuck happened? - Everything happened, okay? The sheriff, he blew up the cabin. - He blew up the cabin? - Yeah, I got busted and then Lew Grade, he kicked my ass. And he told us all to piss off. I mean how do you like that? The whole plan's gone to shit. You know we're all a bunch of fucking morons. - [Violet] He blew up the cabin? - Yes, the sheriff who busted me blew up the cabin. He knew Rupert. - Rawley fucking Wade. - Well shit! - Shut up Isaac. - Rawley Wade that son of a bitch! - Jesus Rod, you fucked up man. We're all screwed now. - No, Isaac, no. I mean you guys, this isn't fair. It's not my fault. I mean it wasn't my plan. And Leonard, Leonard was supposed to be there like three and a half hours ago. - I bet I know where that asshole is! Get in the car! - Um, Violet? - [Violet] What? - We're gonna need some money for gas. - Fuck! This is all we got left. That little prick, more deal. - Damn motor mouth.

That's not what I do. - Come on! You fucked up! - Hey. - Couple of pipe loads and you gotta bang everything you see? - What are you talking about? - Now we're a bunch of morons. - We were supposed to pick up the meth and meet Lew Grade, asshole. - Hey don't you start growing a set of balls, you little punk. - I'm looking for reasons not to kill you, Leonard. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is the problem here? I'm picking it up tonight. Don't worry. [mysterious music] Oh you fucking guys. You think I'm setting you up? - It's all gone, Leonard. - Gone? - Yeah gone! - I didn't have anything to do with it. Where the hell did it go? - [Rod] Rawley Wade burnt down the cabin. - Oh fuck me! - [Boy] Rupert's gonna kill us, Leonard. He's gonna fucking blow. - It's gone. Fucking Rawley Wade. Who the hell gave away the cabin? - Rod. - You're supposed to wait 15 minutes. Make sure that you're not followed. - I did. - Oh your brother ought to be real proud of you. You're a real fucking genius. Screwed up my whole plan. - Your plan? - Yeah, my plan. Our plan, everybody's plan. Don't you fuck with me Rod. - Rupert's out in three days. We don't have a dime of his money. - [Man] You think I ought to shave the whole thing, let it come back in even? - Oh man, don't do that. Look like an asshole. Don't look that bad. - Are you kidding, it looks ridiculous. - Don't look that damn bad. - It'll grow back, right? - How'd you lose it? - I burnt it. On a pipe. - Meth pipe? Don't worry about it, it'll grow back. Full tank is a thing of beauty, Jim. Good doing business with you man. - He look here Lew, this is black way.

Well, information's made you awfully quiet. You used to be so belligerent. - Fuck you. - Atta boy. How's Violet? - You better stay the fuck away from her, my friend. - Big girl, hard to miss. - Fuck you! She is big and beautiful. And I am outta here in 36 hours. - Let me tell you something, asshole. You better put an end to any plans you're hatching, you understand me? And when you leave here, drive straight to Nevada. You so much as stop for gasoline, I will kill you. - Fuck you, son of a bitch! Fuck you! Fuck! - You're not speeding are you? - No. - Isn't it too hot for that jacket? - I like it, okay. - Play it again. - Violet? - [Violet] Yeah. - You look really beautiful today. Oh fuck! That's him! - God damn Rawley Wade! Oh I wanna kill him! Jesus, do I have to see and hear about him every day before Rupert gets out? That asshole's been swarming around like a hawk. You know, sometimes I wish we were murderers. I really do, Rod. Sometimes I really do. I wish we could do that kind of shit. - Well Leonard said he killed somebody. - I don't even wanna talk about Leonard. - Violet? Do you think he went to see Rupert? - Fuck. - You incompetent assholes. Is it that fucking difficult to lay low? Huh? You lose the meth, you lose the cabin. You have destroyed everything that I have been building. And I've gotta suffer Rowley Wade rubbing my nose in your shit. - Look Rupert, he's probably just been watching us, you know? - Watching you? I'm getting out in a day and a half. He's gonna know when you wipe your asses for God's sake. You sound guilty, Rod. Now what the fuck did you do? - Leonard screwed it up, Rup. It wasn't Rod's fault. - Really? That little bitch Leonard's gonna be dead when I get out of here. But you let me down babe. You know Leonard's no good. I'm surprised he hasn't stabbed us in the back yet. You still got the money, right? - Yeah babe. Of course we do. - Rod, do we still have the money? - I said we got it. - Rod! - Yeah, all right, we have the money. - All right, all right. Where'd you get that bracelet Violet? Somebody buy that for you? - I bought it, Rup. I thought you'd like it. - Yeah, yeah, it's classy. [chuckling] And that jacket. - Oh this you know it's just something I got on discount. - Discount huh, all right. That is not discount. That's fucking leather. - Babe we got all your money. We've been pulling a few side jobs. And I'm getting the meth back too. - All right, okay. Don't you fuck me babe. Huh, 'cause I got a new plan for when I get out of here. It is a new dynasty for us. Huh? Rod, we're getting out of this wasteland and we're gonna make more money than dad did in his whole life at that pathetic mine. How's that sound, huh? Now, Rawley fucking Wade, that around the clock asshole's gonna be waiting for me so don't you do anything, Violet. You understand me? You just wait for me. And it's just gonna be us from now on. No more Leonard and no more fucking Isaac. When I get out of here, we are gonna take that money we saved up and we are gonna move to Montana. How's that sound? We can run the same damn business outside of Rawley Wade country. Oh God. You look good Violet. Oh baby, you haven't been wearing that around Isaac have you? 'Cause I know he's after you baby. She hasn't, has she? - No, first time that I've seen it. - You better not be. 'Cause that little weasel is after you. I know he is. You are just too damn big and beautiful. Come on.

Em and Clark were murdered. - Murdered? - 22 in the back of the head. - What? Oh my God. - You know as I look out at all of you I realize that every single one of us has a story to tell about Em and Clark Smith. All of us have lived our lives together with Em and Clark. And what I see so clearly right now is that this isn't the first time... And I caught my first trout... Never would have been the same around town. Fishing record trout out of our own Honeywell hatchery. [laughing] My father taught me a lesson. It was never to forget your ancestors. The people who pioneered this land. Founded our community. Emma and Clark embodied that for all of us. It's their spirit that truly binds us together. Everyday our conversations are filled with the names of the people who pioneered this land and settled our community with a standard for living that's the foundation of our pride. Emma and Clark Smith now take their place alongside of Walker, Honeywell, Conway, Paranay. We've all lost part of ourselves with the passing of Em and Clark. But it's what we preserve in their memory that will sustain us. We thank God for his good earth. And we're so grateful for the privilege of inheriting the souls that have made it our home. [slow music] - Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you. - It's all right, Gor. - Hello Sheriff. - Good morning. [indistinct mumbling] - It was real nice. - Well thank you. You should thank my father. He's the one that put this together. - Okay, I will. I just... - Sheriff? Sorry, didn't mean to butt in. - No it's okay. Well it's... [indistinct mumbling] - My name's Delbert Cantana. You don't know me. I'm from over in Darwin in Nevada. Ma'am. - Sharon Geller, Sheriff Rawley Wade. - I heard about what happened over here, and I wanted to come over and pay my respects to the dead. - I appreciate that. - It was a terrible thing. - Yes it was. - Yeah, it is, it's a terrible thing. Terrible. [indistinct mumbling] - Jessup was really wonderful today. All the things he said, they were so sound. He always seems to know exactly what to do. - Yeah, sure does. Always has as far back as I can remember. - Rawley? - Yeah? - What's going on with us? Look, I know you have a lot of things in front of you right now, I understand I really do. Maybe that's the problem. I'm just so ready for you, for us. I don't know what you're waiting for. I don't know what's gonna make things different. [slow music] - Look, Karen, everything's gonna be all right. You have to believe that. It's just that I... What was that thing your mother said about the morning? - Good things always come to you in the mornings. - That's right. And tomorrow morning will be a spectacular sunrise. [serene music] [mysterious music] - Mr. Quintana. - Wade, isn't it? - That's right, Sheriff Rawley Wade. - What brings you out here, Wade? Can I get you a drink? - No thanks. Just stopped in to see if Rod Major still worked for you. - Oh hell no. Got rid of him a while ago. Why, is he in trouble? - I think he is. You know his brother Rupert? - I do. I know the whole family. Let me tell you something, Sheriff. You get a good solid mining family and they'll give you five generations, maybe more and these generations, the miners, get better and better. It's genetics. Hell, everything's genetics. But the family structure will build a foundation of tradition. Now we got our own econo system here but when the foundation crumbles, well then you get your ghost town. And I believe that about mining. My father believed it and his father before him. You get a split in the family structure and the only way to handle it is to nip it in the bud. You know what I mean? - Sure. What kind of trouble is Rod in? - Geez, he's let that mess fry his brains. That kid had a lot of potential a few years back. I might have stood up for him. Ever since his dad died, who I might say comes from a line of the best miners that ever came out of Darwin, Nevada. God rest his soul. I'll tell you, Rupert, he has got a whole... Any kind of virtue that kid has left. - I know all about Rupert. Just wanted to come by and see how far down the road Rod was. Well listen, Mr. Quintana, I appreciate your time. Thanks. - Hey. Sheriff, I've been kind of, you know speaking of new stops... Say, on another note you haven't seen the new magnesium bits, have you? One with the nine nubs instead of eight? Drill the hell out of a rock. Wanna take a look at it? - No. [indistinct mumbling] [slow music] [knocking on door] - Hi Sheriff. - Hello Mark. I didn't think you were home. I'm just up here asking some of the residents if they've heard or seen anything suspicious during the last couple of weeks, around the time the Smiths were killed. - Uh, I, sorry. I didn't notice anything. - You sure? Nothing peculiar or strange? - Not a thing, no. - If you think of anything will you give me a call? - Sure, yeah. - Appreciate it. - Uh, Sheriff. - Yes Mark? - You did a real nice job on the ceremony. - Thank you, Mark. [mysterious music] [dog barking] [soft rock music] [glass shattering] [indistinct shouting] [car engine starting] [knocking on door] - Joseph. Morning. - Hi, Richard. I hope I'm not bothering you? - No, no, no come on in, come on in. Go on, please have a seat. - Thank you Richard. New curtains? - Jenny made them. Honey, Joseph's here. - [Jenny] Okay, I'll be right down. - Get you something to drink? - Yes please. - [Richard] How about lemonade? - Sounds perfect. - Jenny's scared out of her mind. You know our hardware store's completely sold out of deadbolts. - Really? - I just can't believe this whole business about the Smiths. - Terrible thing, isn't it? - [Richard] Got any idea who might have done it? - No. - You don't? - Not yet anyway. - Hi Joseph. - Hi Jenny. - Honey, Joseph says they have no idea who the killer is. - What? - Richard, I said not yet. Jenny, we're gonna catch this guy. - Like cash for that? - Just give me some quarters. Thanks a lot. What are the best machines to play? - You like to play reels, you like to play video poker? - How about reels? - Try those by the window over there. - Thanks. [slow, sauntering music] [coins jingling] [country music] [coins jingling] - Whoo, home sweet home. Darlene, let's flow the scotch. Splash down, darling. Johnny Walker Red. Hey Bill, how you doing? - [Bill] All right partner, how you doing? - I live and breathe. I'm rolling today, darling. And you ought to be kissing up. - [Darlene] You win enough, you know where to find me. - You love me, huh? You be sweet. Sweeter than that. [machine beeping] [indistinct chatter] - All right, see you. Nice fucking mustache. - Fuck you, Kojak. [mysterious music] [coins jingling] [semi engine revving] [machine beeping] - I like cowboys. You're quite the cowboy. - Yeah? You're a few hundred miles from Hollywood, partner. - Oh that's such a shame. Then perhaps you can show me how to bet for ranch. Oh you like that, do you? You like that? I can be very generous to the right kind of cowboy. - Darlene, get me a drink for my friend. Make it strong. So, how do you partner? - Good. I think my luck is changing. - I feel the same god damn way. Darlene, cancel those drinks. [machine beeping] [coins jingling] There's another lucky bastard. [machine beeping] - What you do to be an American cowboy nowadays? Shoot people, rob banks, lay them in their graves? - Yeah I did all that. - And what is that? - That's just my gun, partner. - You shoot bad man with that gun? You wouldn't shoot me, would you? - No. [slow music] Not if you're nice to me. - Don't do it, Leonard. [dramatic music] [gun firing] [slow music] - My God, quick draw. He was trying to kill me. You're very good with a gun. - What did he tell you in the casino? - I don't know so much cowboy stuff. Stagecoach robbery. - Stagecoach? - Yes, I think that's right. Poor little lad. He was so full of gusto. Killing, bank robbing, meta something. Cute like a little talkative Montgomery Cliff. - Is that all you can remember? - I'm afraid my attention was elsewhere. Where are you staying? - No, that's my question to you. - Excuse me, excuse me. My name is Klaus. I stay at Independence, California, just down the highway. It's very nice there. - Independence? Okay, Klaus. Make sure you don't venture too far up the highway 385. There's a lot of degenerates that hang out in these mighty town casinos. It can be very dangerous. - Don't worry. I'll be careful. - Very dangerous. - Sheriff, when I was driving most truck drivers was good people. Broke down out there, you could count on a truck driver to help you out. Road etiquette, that's what it was. Nowadays there's some pretty bad people out there. Anyway, here's what you're looking for. Stagecoach Line, this is your guy, Jim Broody. Keeps a damn regular schedule, Sheriff. Looks like a circular route. Strange. - How's that? - I mean the shortest distance being a straight line, guy making a regular run, making a regular drop, why wouldn't he go back the same way he came? - Maybe he's taking the scenic route. Thanks Dan. - You bet. Listen Sheriff, you just let me know what you're looking for I'll be more than happy to help you find it. [upbeat country music] - How we doing Wayne? - Well, I gotta tell you Joseph. It's not going too good. I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep since the Smiths were killed. And Geraldine's got me checking the windows every half hour. - Yeah, we've been going through exactly the same thing, Joseph. In fact after you left this morning, Jenny and I were talking. We think we might rent a room here in town until this whole thing blows over. I mean that's why we moved up here in the first place, to get away from this sort of stuff. - Listen folks, we're right on top of this situation. All you gotta do is take a few extra precautions. Keep your doors locked, keep your eyes open and we'll all get through this together. - Joe, I gotta tell you. The people at the Funnel Ranch are really concerned. - I'm aware of that Rusty. - We're not trying to give you a hard time, Joseph. We're just rattled. - Joe, do you think we need to bring in some outside help? - Joe doesn't need any outside help, Wayne. We can handle everything here just fine. - He's right Wayne. Joseph, we'll be here if you need our help. - I do appreciate that Ken. - [Sheriff] Okay folks, let's all go home now. [indistinct chatter] - Thanks Joe. - Tell Geraldine I said hello. - See you Wayne. [mysterious music] - [Klaus] Bartender, peppermint schnapps, please. I like cowboys. You're quite the cowboy. - Get in. - What's this all about? - Just drive. [upbeat music] - Daddy, you're not as pretty as mama. But I am still your girl. I'm still daddy's little girl. That piece of shit truck ready? Rod, you put gas in this dead bastard's truck? - Yeah. - Let's go! - Courtesy of Rawley Wade. - What? - I was just noticing your lip there. That little spot right there. Thought it was a cut, but that's a burn isn't it? I can see the little singed inset. It's burnt, isn't it? - Yeah, it's burnt. [birds squawking] - Pull that fucker over or I'll blow your god damn head off! - All right, now god dammit hold on. God dammit all right. - Better do as she says. - Pull it over, mother fucker! [mysterious music] Let's go, get out dick for brains, move it! What? - Rawley Wade. - What? Don't fuck with me!

[gun firing] - Do you love me? [gun firing] [slow music] - What is it? - What do you say you and I take the rest of the day off? - Okay. - Hey son. - Hey dad. We're gonna take a ride up to Yosemite. - Sounds great. But you've got a telephone call. Mark Bradley wants to talk to you. - Mark Bradley? - Line two. - Hello? - [Mark] Hello? - Yeah Mark? - Anyone else on the phone? Doesn't matter. Seems like I can't... Clear right now. Rawley? I had to call you. I just needed to talk to someone. What happened to the Smiths. That was wrong. They were a good family. That shouldn't have happened. - No, Mark, it shouldn't have. - Rawley, people are gonna be in trouble. - What do you mean? Mark? What do you mean people are gonna be in trouble? - I can't hurt myself Rawley. I'm sorry I can't. - Mark, what's going on up there? Do you want me to come up? - It shouldn't have happened that way. The Smiths were so good. All I wanted to do was hold them. I wanted to hold them. Just to know what it was like, but I couldn't. I'm so, so... I have no family. Rawley, I killed them, I killed them, I killed them. - Mark, you killed the Smiths? - Yes I did, they're gone. They're gone. And I don't want it to happen again. You've gotta come up here. - Mark? [mysterious music] Mark! [screaming] Mark! [screaming] - I just don't get it Rawley. If Mark killed the Smiths then who slashed his throat? [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah, he's here, hold on a second. Rawley, it's your dad. - Yeah dad? What? - It's Richard Philmore. His throat's been cut. - [Girl] If Mark killed the Smiths, who slashed his throat? - [Joseph] It's Richard Philmore. - That's why we moved up here in the first place. Get away from this sort of stuff. - [Rawley] Mark, you killed the Smiths? - [Mark] I had no family. [rock music] [bell ringing] [loud banging] [grunting] [moaning] [door creaking] [crickets chirping] - Thanks Billy. [suspenseful music] How's she doing? - She's in pretty bad shape. What happened to you? - I killed Rupert Major. - Rupert Major? - Yeah, he jumped me with a hunting knife. No dad, it's not Rupert. - For crying out loud, who is it? - Wait a minute. Take a look at this dad. I found that in Mark Radley's cabin. - My God. Who would wanna bring this back to life? - [Rawley] I gotta go. - Rawley. - I'll call you later. [mysterious music] - Sheriff. [gun firing] - My God, he's trying to kill me. I knew you'd come. I'll show you. You see I have you right here. Next to little Montgomery Clifton like river. And I loved you in Hondo, so tall. I love America. Klaus says, what makes a Charlie Manson forever! - Charlie Manson. I can't believe he has a website. That photograph of Charlie in the same cell in 1969. It was August '69 the day we brought him in here. Evil, pure evil. My God Rawley, it's taken me 29 years to get this thing out of my life. Never thought I'd see anything like this again. World's getting smaller, son. No matter how far we are from everything, this highway brings it all right to us. Where you going son? - I'm going home dad. [slow, gentle music] [bluesy music] - [Klaus] I like cowboys. You're quite the cowboy.
