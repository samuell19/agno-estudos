WOMAN: This is me. Or her. That's what we look like. She's different. I'm different. One day I realized I could no longer tell my dream world from my real world. It felt to me that I was no longer one person, but two. DOUBLED VOICE: I don't know who I am anymore. Hey, you actually got it. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Hey, wait! Wait! SARAH: Mommy, look. * Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens * Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens * Brown paper packages tied up with string * These are a few of my favorite things * Oh, that was so great. Okay. Come here. Oh! [BELL TOLLING] It was. [JEAN-PIERRE SPEAKS FRENCH] Mommy! No more stories. Oh! Mmm. All right. Covers, covers, covers, covers. I'll read you more stories tomorrow. All right, beautiful. Night-night, Mama. Don't forget about me. Not hardly. Jen? It's time, honey. Mom. Let's go. Good night, Jean-Pierre. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] To my angel from Mommy and my sister, and Jean-Pierre and Micheline, and all my friends from the village. Even Danny and Alex, who aren't real. [CHUCKLES] And keep my daddy safe with you and love him. [SIGHS] Mommy, [STAMMERS] could you lay in bed with me until I fall asleep? Sure, honey. I'd love to. Get your stuff out. Let's put your goodies away. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] [WOMAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON TV] [CONTINUES SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SIGHS] [DOOR SQUEAKS] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [ELECTRONIC BEEPING] [CLICK] [BEEPING STOPS] [MOANS SOFTLY] MAN ON TV: The arrival of July has brought the onset of storm season as Hurricane Julie pounded the Eastern Seaboard. Hardest hit was the town of New Halifax on the coast of Maine. Normally a quiet vacation community, it is now an endless sea of debris, broken homes and broken dreams. With winds in excess of 100 miles per hour, the storm hammered boats and homes for hours. [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE BEEPS] Hello? Oh, hey. No, I can't bring you. Because ex-boyfriends are very awkward for business, and especially for the clients. Yeah, even almost-exes. Thursday, uh, I think I'm in Chicago. But you know what? I don't have my book in front of me. Look, if I had a sister, I'd set you up with her, but you know, that's what you get for going out with an only child. I'll call you later, okay? Okay. You're late. Yes, I know. Thank you. I'll do Throzen after Chicago, okay? [MUTTERING] On Jonathan's cover, I think the design isn't half bad. I think the problem is in the color. But I'll call Macmillan. That's okay. What's this? Aaron Reilly? Mr. Reilly, it's good to meet you. We can get to the Mr. Reilly stuff later. Let's start out as Aaron and Marty. Please. You're here to ream me, Marty. [CHUCKLES] We both have full schedules. Let's get to it. Well, I don't usually interfere with a client's business manager, particularly one as new to the client as you are. But I've been unusually irresponsible? Oh, no! Not at all. I mean, considering you've only known Ed six weeks? Four-and-a-half. [CHUCKLES] Lucy Schaefer lived with Ed for three years. Less, actually. During which time she was doing the deed behind his back. Hmm. Not a nice lady. Even he knows that now. Marty, it's his money. But if we give her that much of it, how is this poor girl ever going to start building some character? [CHUCKLES] What do you think, I represent this woman? I never saw the bitch in my life. We talked it through, Marty, slow, careful and really complete. It's what he wants to do. Mr. Reilly, don't you believe in saving someone you care about from himself? [CHUCKLES] No, ma'am, I sure don't. I'm not that smart. Thanks. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [WIND CHIMES JINGLING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [BELL TOLLING] [DOOR UNLOCKING] [GROWLS] What are you doing in here? How did you get in here? I stole the key from Jennifer. She told me to. [EXHALES] Are you mad? No! [LAUGHS] No, baby, I'm not mad. You didn't wake me up. But your sister's gonna be in big trouble. Yay! [CHUCKLES] [MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] No, no, no! [GASPS] Got you! Don't get Jessie. [GRUNTING] [SOBBING] God, she's stubborn. Why won't she ask anybody for help? I wonder. [CHUCKLES] Help is on the way. Go, go, go! Whee! [GRUNTING] You having a problem? No, Mom. I'm fine. [CHUCKLES] What's funny? Nothing's funny. Nothing. I... I like it when you try hard. Especially at, uh, things you don't think you're very good at. Mom, it's not that. Okay, okay! You know, sometimes when things come really easy to someone, they think they have to be perfect at everything. But we're not perfect, are we? No. Do you know anything that's perfect? So why would you want to be no one and nothing? Do you think that's me? Yeah, I do. 'Cause you're just like me. SARAH: Nanny, nanny, boo-boo! You can't catch me! JENNIFER: Yes, I can! [SIGHS] Oh, ouch! Damn it! Twenty minutes now. We've discussed the rain and the roses and the hot cakes. Why do I feel you're avoiding something? I'm so obvious. God, I hate that. Mmm. How's the dream? No, I said that awkwardly. How is New York today? New York was, uh, fine. I'm not your shrink, baby. I'm just the dear old girl who comes and drinks your whiskey, plays in your garden. I don't want to see him, Jessie. I don't. I don't want to see any Dr. Langer. We had a deal. A year ago, we said, if this was still going on, I wanted you to see someone. We said? You said. And he's actually Viennese. Isn't that perfect? [CHUCKLES] You're not giving up on me, are you? No. As long as you still want me here. No, until you tell me good-bye, there's hope. And so, my good friend Jessica tells me of an interesting case of multiple personality. Martha? Marie? MARIE: Here, it's Marie. Marie. When you fall asleep at night, in that instant you find yourself waking in another world. In another life, where your name is? Marty. Hmm. And what do you call this situation? [CHUCKLES] A full life. [CHUCKLES] My goodness, yes. One is tempted to ask, could it be too full? I have a psychiatrist in New York. He thinks that I'm a Manhattan career woman who dreams of being a mother in France. See, that's the problem with all of you guys. You all think you're real, and I don't blame you. [CHUCKLES] Well, we can't all be real, can we? That would be impossible. One world is real, the other a dream. Yes. [SCOFFS] I know that. But you do not know which. Why is that, I wonder? [SIGHS] Because if I realized which life wasn't real, then, well, um, the dream wouldn't work. It wouldn't give me the satisfaction of that life. I suppose it wouldn't. [CHUCKLES] Very ingenious, but not without its dangers. Do you realize how deliberate you make this sound, as if you could turn it on and off? You're riding two horses, and the mind is not built to do that without breaking apart. I don't... I don't know how to get back to the way I used to be. [MOANING SOFTLY] [ALARM CLOCK BEEPING] [BEEPING STOPS] [SIGHS] DR. PETERS: Viennese, no less. Your Jessie is really wheeling in the heavy artillery. Perfect, isn't it? So, what did, uh... Dr. Peters, I really need to smoke today. You don't need to smoke. Do you mind if I have a cigarette? I could really use just one. Yes, I do mind. No. Ah, you're so great. Marty. Marty. Come on. Just one more puff. Please. Marty. Okay. It's going out. So, Dr. Freud told you what? You should realize, he says, that New York has to be the dream world. I mean, who would fantasize being a housebound mother and a widow at that? No romance. That has to be real. But New York, ah! Glamorous career. Power. Self-expression. Endless line of men wanting to date you. Every minute spent at your own whim. Now, if that's not a dream, huh? He said it faster with less drama. So, you say to Dr. Freud? Please stop calling him that. It's Dr. Langer, and he's as real as you are. So, you told Dr. Langer what? My New York shrink thinks my life in Manhattan is hard work, hostile, adversary work, with long, grinding hours. That yes, there are a lot of men, but no real, uh, romance, no one to love me, and I'm alone, and who would dream that? What about the loneliness? Jessie said that a woman still grieving for her late husband isn't ready to love anyone yet, not even in their dreams. [CHATTERING] Okay. I need to put you down so I can pay. [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Goodness! [COINS CLATTERING] Sarah? [BELL RINGS] Sarah? Sarah? Serafine? Sarah? Sarah? [CHILD LAUGHING] No, it isn't. Why, sure it is. You should go look for your mommy. She'll be worried. Serafine? I told you not to run off like that. Oh, goodness. You scared me. You know her? My mommy. Oh. You know, where I come from, people steal mommies who get lost in the market, so you keep an eye on her. You like my hat? Yes, honey, I do. I like your hat very much. But I think you should give it back now, okay? Oh, it's clean. I made it for her. Well, then I guess you've got yourself a new hat. Oh, we better get going or we're going to be late. Can he come with us to the park? Oh, I wish I could. Bye-bye. So long, lady. Nice talking to you both. Okay. SARAH: Bye! Bye. SARAH: Go higher. All right, three more big pushes and then we've got to go get Jennifer. One, two, three! Whoa! Okay, grab your stuff, then we'll get going. Hey, you forgot your jacket. Hey. [MAN CHUCKLES] [EXCLAIMS] [SARAH LAUGHING] I thought you weren't coming to the park. I said I wish I could, so I did. Ah. Always do what you wish you could. [CHUCKLES] Is that the secret of happiness? [STAMMERING] No, it's, uh... It's just what's right. Well, I wish we could stay, but... Yeah. Uh, I mean we have to go pick up Jennifer from school. Let's go. Thanks, honey. Another time, then. SARAH: Bye. Bye. Are you flirting? [BOTH CHUCKLE] MAN: Get off of me! [GRUNTING] Oh! Ed! Oh, Marty, hey. Jesus, is it 10:00 already? Listen, hang on just a sec, will ya? It's 19-12. You know Aaron Reilly, don't you? Give me that ball. [GROANS] [GROANS] Shit. I've got your contracts. Phyllis agreed. Hey, listen. Just give the manuscript to Phyllis, okay? I've decided to fight Lucy's demands. Yeah, well, you've got your friend Aaron to thank. That game, those were the stakes. [BALL BOUNCING] MAN: Oh, that's two. [PLAYERS CHATTERING] WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Marty, I have your call to Aaron Reilly on line one. [PHONE BEEPS] Hi. Aaron? Hi. This is Marty Talridge. I just wanted to call and say thank you for Ed's manuscript. Well, I didn't do it for you. You didn't? But thanks for the thanks. Anyway, how grateful are you? Well, how grateful am I supposed to be? Central Park, Sunday morning at 9:00, Cherry Hill, across from the fountain. Just take 30 minutes of your time. Dress is informal. I'll bring refreshments. I'll think about it. They're lovely. Well, they're not for you. Ah. Serafine! Your boyfriend's here. They're not for her either. Hi. How you doing? Look what I got for you. Whoa. What do you say? Merci, monsieur. You've gotta be Jennifer. Okay. Then these are yours. Go ahead. Merci, monsieur. Ta-da! And sweets, too? What are you up to? Courting. Courting who? Whoever. Bite. [THANKS IN FRENCH] Good. Your name is William. William what? Granther. William Granther. Hey, Jen? Why don't you take your sister up and show Mr. Granther how you catch the Frisbee? You guys are great. Go on, we'll watch from right here. Uh, point me in the direction of the kitchen and I'll put those in water. You still writing? [CHUCKLES] Well, yeah. Some of us never learn. I'm down in Menton by the beach writing a new book. Great. Yeah, found out you were in the neighborhood. That review. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I still have it. Well, not in my pants, but I have it. [CHUCKLES] The thing is, uh, I didn't like the book. Oh. Well, that explains the review. Well, um, so much for cordial relationships. Well, that depends on how things simmer, for both of us. [SNIFFS] Ah. [CHUCKLES] Gotta go back to Menton. Oh, sorry. How did you know it was me? The other day in the market. Oh, the butcher pointed you out. And I realized you were the one who gave me that fantastic review. Figures. [ENGINE STARTS] You know what this guy really is? What? He's the chance to love again. See, you're starting to come out of your coma, and it terrifies you. In New York, you sleep with men you don't love and feel safe. Now along comes William, you feel a pull, and you react in your dream by creating this accountant. Aaron Reilly? Mmm-hmm. Oh, no. You're wrong. He's... He's no competition. This seat taken? Hmm. I don't know. I'm expecting quite a crowd. But, uh, since you're the first. Coffee? Thank you. When you think of ducks, what do you think of? Orange sauce. You know, there's something about two people sharing their souls on a Sunday morning that just... You didn't have to dress. I said dress was informal. Oh, yes. I remember. Well, here I am, driven by gratitude, up at dawn, dressed informally. So, what's up? Nothing's up. We're just gonna hang out for 30 minutes. Why would we do that? Because I'm interested. Alarm? Mild alarm. Uh-oh. It's even worse than you think. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. I'm not interested in dating you. You're not. I don't enjoy rejection enough to wait in line for it. And I'm not the kind of guy who attracts you. And what kind of guy is that? Handsome, but with enough edge to make it a little dangerous. Someone powerful who can sweep you off your feet. Who you can control only by leaving, which is, of course, the safest control of all. Of course. My turn? Sure. So, what are you interested in? You. Just who you are. It's scary, huh? Oh, yeah. See, I can be dangerous, too. So, what, you need a friend? Hey, don't move for me. No silly faces. Okay, come on. Please smile. Oh, so pretty. Oh! That one was very good. Come out, please. I don't want to take a picture. Jen, you are making this so difficult. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [SHUTTER CLICKS] [CHATTERING] This seat taken? I've been waiting for you since 9:00. The butcher said Fridays you have a sitter, so you shop alone. A woman, he assured me, of regular habits. God, it's hell having a snoop for a butcher. Um... So, how are things? [CHUCKLES] Things are fine. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHING] Oh, God. I love talking small. Saturday night. A real date, okay? 8:00, dress up, everything. Dress is formal. My husband died a couple of years ago, and... I haven't had a real date. Well, that's great. You'll be terrifically uncomfortable, as I plan to put the pressure on right away. [CHUCKLES] I've decided I want you to like me. WILLIAM: Hi there. Table for one? Or were you expecting someone? Careful. Wait here. Okay, you can look. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] It's beautiful. [BOTH CHUCKLING] Voila. [BOTH LAUGHING] Do you know what that taste is? No. What... What is this? Coriander. Coriander and fennel. And fennel, huh? Mmm-hmm. Well, there's a trace, a trace of fennel. Trace of fennel. Trace. I can taste that trace. What about the zinc? Zinc? [BOTH LAUGHING] What are you doing? Are you reviewing my food, too? No! Yes, you are! I'm a saucier. I spent two years learning to do sauces. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. So, when you should have been learning to write, you've been so busy learning your saucing. Oh, say, when you should have been learning how to make someone bleed, you were. Oh, ho, ho, ho! I'm just trying to make light of my own guilt. That's funny, because I'm just trying to use it. Lightly. Well, lightly, of course, yeah. I can't believe I'm eating with you. I just can't believe I'm eating with you. Not after that review. But doesn't it make it so exciting? You know, the book that I said I came down here to finish, it's actually done. I just came down here to pick at it and... And worry. Worry's good. Worry's very, very constructive. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but, um... [SIGHS] I want you to read it. [GASPS] God, what an awful lie. [BOTH LAUGHING] I don't want you to read it. I want you to be crazy about it. If you could manage that without actually reading it, I'd do anything for you. Is it good? Well, no, not entirely. But, um, there are things in it that are very, very good. Christ, I just want you to read it. And I want you to have this... This look, this, uh, this flushed look, if you can imagine that. And I want you to think, "What a guy. "A guy who can... "Can feel like that, I wonder how he'd..." Make love? Yeah. And even more serious stuff. I'd like to come home with you. [CHUCKLES] I'd like to say yes. But I can't. Maybe another time. It's a deal. So, usually Wednesday lunch. What, some guy who's gorgeous, influential. Rack of lamb, talk about power, sex, fashion choices. God, I miss it. Why do you do this to yourself? Because I like you too much. And we both know it. Well, it doesn't mean we have to wear it. But on you, it looks [CHUCKLES] good. I have something for you. It's a... It's not technically an heirloom, but... It's very precious to me. No, no, no. No. You can't open it till you're all alone. [CHUCKLES] Oh, this guy. JENNIFER: Will you cook me a picnic, too, someday? Mommy says you cook. Sure, I'll cook you a peanut butter hamburger with raspberry jam. Mommy would never eat that. Oh, I'll make your mommy a chicken and tarragon sandwich. Yes, hold the fennel. Hold the fennel, hold the zinc. So, what else did your mommy tell you about me? She says you write stories. Uh-huh. Do you live in New York? No. Why New York? She knows a writer in New York, and I want her to show him all her stories. Her stories? Your mommy reviews other people's stories in The New York Times. She doesn't write her own stories. Counsel leading the witness. That's overruled. She has her stories. In a box in a closet. Don't you want to see them? In a box? How about this weather? Look at these cumulus clouds. Boy, are they just something. Are you sure there's clouds up there? Because I don't see any. Get real. How about what's in the closet? In the box. Gonna let me see them? Wish I could. [PLAYING TUNE] It's the wrong way around. [MUSIC STOPS] God, I hate to break up this beautiful romance, but it's time for bed. Mom, it's too early. Oh, no. I think it's quite late. All right, you. Night-night, Mama. Don't forget about me. Not hardly. There's something about your girls, about being with them. I guess children make you a real person. Do they? I think so. You have to be real. They see. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Sometimes I wish you didn't look like you do. Why? Because people who look like you have learned not to trust. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't explain it. While you feel like that, even if it's forever, don't fight it. I want to make love to you. I think about it all the time. But in a way, in a real way, I'm afraid. All my life, sex never really brought me closer to... Usually, it was the beginning of the end. And I don't want this to end. This house, those children, your warmth. Everything about you. Don't let me do anything to lose that, okay? Okay. [SIGHS] Now, walk me to my car. Are you gonna come back in the morning and make me breakfast? Why? I'm going somewhere? Afraid the kids will see me? I could say that. Or I could say it's... Because of my husband. But it's something else. If someone was to be with me, and woke me up, something bad might happen. It's... It's very crazy, and... I can't tell you about it. Can I have that much mystery? [SIGHS] It's okay. It's okay. I'll leave. [KISSING] Mmm. Well, you... I could maybe stay awake another hour or so. [BOTH CHUCKLING] If you played your cards right, I could almost even make it three. [CHUCKLING] [PANTING] [GASPS] Hello? Um, hey. Come on in. Hi. Thanks a lot for coming over. Sure. Um, would you like something to drink? No, thanks. Coffee or anything? Water? I'm fine. Okay. Um, you want to come on in and, uh, you can sit over here. Um, if you'd like, you can sit here or there. Um... Good morning. Hi. Um... I don't know why I, uh, why I really called. Um... I'm... I'm, uh... I'm sorry I'm like this. I'm usually very strong and together. I know. But, um, something happened in France last night, and I'm... I'm just, um... I'm just not sure how I feel about it. In France? I think I may have fallen in love with someone, and I made love to him last night, and I don't even know if he's real. I'm sorry. You, um... You slept with someone last night in France? Yeah. Uh... [EXHALES] Um... Aaron, you may think that I am absolutely, certifiably insane. And if you do, and you want to go, I'll completely understand. I have a whole other life in France. And that's not even the bad part. The bad part is, um, that both lives are so equal, and so real to me that... Well, I don't know which one is the dream and which one is real. I don't even know if you're real. Are you sitting over there saying, "Shit. How fast can I get to the door?" [LAUGHS] Uh... I'm real. Well, you know, that's what they all say. I'm sorry. It's, uh... I've been analyzed to death, and so... I was thinking maybe I could use a friend. Well, you've got that. [SIGHS] Wow. What can I do? I don't know if there's anything you can do. But I thought maybe, if it was okay, you could stay with me today. [DIALING] Hey. It's me. I'm gonna take the day off. Uh... Kiss their ass. You can tell them the truth. I don't really care. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Thanks. That's, uh, her in France. Well, or me. It's what we look like there. AARON: Well, she looks good in the earrings. Her hair kind of... Come on. [SIGHS] Let's go. AARON: [LAUGHING] Hey, hey, hey, hey! MARTY: I'm not cheating! Just wait. Just wait. Soon. Soon. Ready? Yes. Here we go. Here we go. [EXCLAIMS] It's beautiful. Yeah. It's my favorite bridge in the world. How come? It's the prettiest. The bridge, or my earrings? Both. Next Wednesday is my birthday. I'm funny about my birthday. Going out would make me lonely, so I always stay in, alone, which is less lonely. So, you busy Wednesday? I've got to go to Atlanta till the end of the week. Some big do in... How about when I get back? Sure. Be just as good. DR. PETERS: You know, Marty, as to your romance with William, it sounds like love when you talk about this guy. I like that. I can see Marie. You seem happy. I like that even better. But if you'll forgive an intrusion from the real world for just a moment, why did you tell Aaron about your condition? I had to tell someone. Maybe we could let Aaron be your analyst, and I'll do your taxes. It was a very distancing thing to do. Look, Marty, Aaron seems like a nice man. You like him. Maybe not romantically, but you seem close. Of course, telling someone you're mad as a hatter doesn't usually bring them any closer. "Mad as a hatter"? It's a medical term I like to use. Listen. Why don't you just keep William in your dreams and in this office for now, and away from everybody else? [TOY TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] I'm funny about birthdays, too. Atlanta? I even, uh, have dinner ready. You'll never guess. Duck with orange sauce. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] [SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] I love this music. [GROANS] It's 2:30 already. Kind of a dirty trick, huh? Birthday on a Wednesday. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Guess I'd better get you a cab. Yeah. Guess you better. [SIGHS] Now, look, uh, in the dream last night, exactly what did you tell Mr. Reilly? Well, uh, exactly? Aren't you going to say good-bye? You gonna be all right now? Everything. [GIGGLING] Oh! Boy, poor Dr. Peters. That must have rattled his teeth. [LAUGHS] I would have thought you'd want me to be honest. I do. I do. But I don't want you scaring this William away. You can bare your soul to Mr. Reilly if you like, but not to William. All he gets is your love. And you know what that love is gonna do? Pretty soon there won't be any dream to tell him about. Just have a good time. Come on! Girls, Mommy's off. Come here, honey. Pleasure meeting you. Pleasure was mine. I'll miss you so much. Good night. Hey! I'll live, okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. One of these days we've got to work on the room thing. I promise. Okay. Good night. Night. [LOCK CLICKS] It's a nice place. Little pricey. Well, of course. I have good taste. When did you steal this? Last night. [SIGHS] So, tomorrow night, you gonna bring me back some foie gras? Oh, how cruelly you make sport of the insane. [LAUGHING] Hey! I prefer "stone-cold nuts" myself, but that's just me. [CROCKERY CLANKING] Has more character. Thank you. [MUTTERING] * My favorite things * When the dog bites What are you doing? * When the bee stings Can I have that, please? Let me guess. Let me guess. You have an older housekeeper and she brings her own tapes. Can I please have this? Give... [LAUGHING] * So bad * So bad [LAUGHING] Stop it. Stop. I'm very identified with Julie Andrews. No kidding. We're practically the same person on the inside. Oh, great. That makes three of you. Yes. Sometimes it's... A little crowded. [TAPE CLICKS ON] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] Will you stop? * Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens * Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens * [GROANS] What am I gonna do? I don't know, but I'm sure glad you didn't call me William. Mmm. That was so yummy. [LAUGHS] Yeah, it was. You, I love. Au revoir. Sorry you can't stay. [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [DIFFERENT SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [INAUDIBLE] So what do you think? I mean, do you hate me? Do you think I'm nuts? Do you, uh... No, no, no. It's worse. I believe you. Worse? You tell me about this nightmare that you're living through. And all I can think of is this other guy. [LAUGHS] I'm jealous. No, I'm crazed about a guy who doesn't exist. Well, he... Never mind. [SIGHS] You really love him, huh? I think so. So how close does he get to seeing who you really are? I don't know, but... But he calls my condition a passion of mind. Well, he's very wise. I'm gonna fight for you. Thank you. Was it good? It was good, wasn't it? Hot. Did you tell him about me? Poor guy. How's he gonna find another girl like you? [GIGGLES] [TAPPING] [WHISTLES] Ha-ha! Like it? Oh, it's great! Once we get the curtains up, TV in, we can put your friend here when he comes to visit. My friend? Your friend. The accountant from New York. What's his name, Arnie something, huh? I can't believe you are making fun of the handicapped. "Handicapped"? He's handicapped, too? He's handicapped and fictitious? Pretty appealing. Not him, doofus. Me. I'm the one who's handicapped. I mean, I'm, you know... Mad as a hatter? Mad as a hatter. Don't you consider that a handicap? Yeah, that's... That's a handicap. [LAUGHING] I don't think it's ever going off. Off? Yeah. The light... That always goes off inside me. So I can move on. Oh, God. You know how to do that? Well, you commit beautifully, and yet you still let me know that you could run, and... Damn you, that keeps me from running first. [SPLASHING] When you think of kids, what do you think of? Orange sauce. I was aiming more at, uh, "How many? When?" You mean, uh, with you? Yeah, me. [LAUGHS] Let's see. With you, I'd want a lot. I'd want a lot with you. You know, kids come first. I'd be real ruthless about that. I'm talking about the way you are. Ah. Ah. That. Mmm. What about France? You gonna have kids with him, too? I don't know. Maybe he likes the ones I've got. Am I so hypnotized? Could I commit my life to you just the way you are? Probably. But I'd never do that to my kids. Not in a million years. And you have to hear that. Couldn't get Jen to sleep. She was in the weirdest mood. She was wild. Crawling under the bed and, uh... I don't know. I couldn't quite figure it out. She was just in the weirdest mood. Stories. From a box in the closet. Jennifer gave them to me after dinner. She said they were beautiful, and I should read them. And it should be our secret. I didn't read them, of course. She's very proud of you. What she did taught me something about what your dream really is. You said what Jen did taught you. In your dream, Marty can do what she wants. She can work with what she loves, and give herself to it, and it's okay. She doesn't have to hide it in a box, in a closet. Every night I go back to a room, and I lie there and I think about you. When I dream, I dream about you. I know what you're saying. No, you don't. I do. I do. The hell you do. It's all built around you. Those people in New York, they're all you. You're analyzing yourself. You're courting yourself. You're making love to yourself. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. I said more than that. I heard everything you said. All of it, and it's right. How long did he give you? [SIGHS] He didn't say. Now. You don't have to lose the whole dream. Just the man. Why do I have to lose anything at all? I don't want to give up either of them. You don't have that choice. You're not playing alone anymore. The real one will leave. And when he does, you'll know the other one is the dream. Which means you've lost him, too. [SIGHING] This is your moment. You've got to go for it. I don't know... I don't know if I can. Yes, you can. WILLIAM: I can't let you be safe anymore. Choose. Choose! [SIGHS] What are you doing? Writing. Oh. I should have guessed. I'm writing in here. So, what did you dream last night? What does he look like? Is he dark? Strong? Pretty? Is he younger than me? Don't do that. Please don't do that. How does he make love to you? Where? How do his hands feel? His lips? Does he get to stay the night? Well, tonight he can. What is it, uh, Sarah says? Don't forget about me. [WHIMPERING] Oh... [BELL DINGS] Are you okay? I'm okay. There's something I want to tell you. Um... You're not going away with me this weekend. Are you sure you're okay? You look... You look kind of weird. I am weird, remember? Oh. Oh, yeah. What are you looking for? I'm glad you're here. What are those? How many of those were you planning to take? Just one. Why? You don't want to sleep? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? I just don't. Why tonight? What's back there? Nothing, nothing, nothing. You can't stay awake forever. Jesus. It's one goddamn pill. You know, you don't have to go there tonight. You could go someplace else. Tahiti, maybe. Maybe you could... Maybe you could take me along. 'Cause I've never been there, and maybe we'd have a hell of a time, and you could... You could tell me all about it over breakfast. And maybe I want to be alone. And I don't want to be alone. I don't. And I'm afraid not to be alone. [VOICE BREAKING] And I want you to stay. Why? Why do you ever have to go back there again? Because my babies need me. Look at this. Wow! What a sweetie. Thank you. I'm really good, aren't I? You are good. Mmm-hmm. What's this? Where did you get this? Just looking around in the bookshelf for whatever... Snooping, basically. I noticed that tin box on one of the shelves, so I peeked inside. You found this here? Yeah. Right in the shelf. You know, last night, before I came in? I lay there, on that incredibly comfortable bed, and I tried to hear you breathing. Couldn't. Started thinking about how close you were. Figured I'd just come over to the bed. I'd see you. And, you know, I was... At first, I was afraid. [LAUGHING] Like, if you woke up, I'd disappear. I actually thought that. I really did. Well, I guess it worked out. You're here. Yeah. Wherever that is. These were, um, my mother's. And, um, these are hers, too. She, uh, wore them together. Nice pictures. This is when I was five, and this one's when I was about 10, 11, I think. You haven't changed much. [LAUGHS] I'm gonna be late. I gotta go. MARTY: What? Just thinking about my best friend. She sounds pretty high-maintenance. I don't know. Could be quite a loser. You might want to dump her. No, she's not a loser, just someone who needs to run when things aren't perfect, and love is never perfect, is it? And if you really care about someone, really care, then you have to respect who they really are. I know who you are. You're the little girl whose mama died in France when she was 11. One time you said, you said, don't I believe in saving someone I care about from himself, and I said, "No, ma'am. "I sure don't. I'm not that smart." I would rather be your best friend than the guy that made you give up any part of yourself. I really would. That's what I aspire to be when I grow up, your best friend. So, if you need to run, you should. [DOOR OPENS] Mommy? [GIGGLES] Mommy? Mommy? Mom? Mommy, what's the matter? Wake up! Mommy! [FOOTSTEPS] [CREAKING] Jean-Pierre? AARON: You, I love. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] [MECHANICAL RATTLING] Marty? [SCREAMS] No, no, no. Easy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. It's okay. Why did you bring me back? I had to see you one more time. I had to say good-bye. Oh, I love you. I know. MARTY: Who knows what dreams are made of? The kiss of a childhood friend, the roar of a stranger's car on a gravel road, the absolute calm of my father's voice, the warmth of my mother's arms. You're not drinking tonight? No, I'm... Talking tonight. Confessing, actually. You go ahead. I can keep a secret. [LAUGHS] Remember how you said you wouldn't give up on me? Uh-huh. You won't, will you? Promise me you won't, 'cause I couldn't do it without you. No. So I guess my big secret is that I love you like crazy, Mom, and I always will, even if I can't be with you like this anymore. I've always been there, even when you didn't know it. Thank you for coming. Well, I figured there'd be a drink waiting. Well, I couldn't let you down. I meant always. Thank you. Me, too. Don't forget about me. Not hardly. Mommy, I had a bad dream. MARTY: Goodness, you guys. Lay back, sweetie, and just relax. Can you rub my foot? Yes, I can rub your foot. Better? It was scary. You know, there's something that I want to talk to you about. Something very, very important. Something for you guys to remember and to know, even when I'm not with you, wherever you might be. What do you mean? You see, we're the same person. All of us, and I love you with all my heart, all of it. Always, always, always. And when you think of me, you... Think, then I will be there. We'll all be there together. I... I love you, Mommy. I love you, too. And wherever you are, just think of me, and I'll be there for you, too. Thank you, sweetie. Love you, Mommy. I love you, sweetie. Can you rub my foot, too? Yes, I can rub your foot, too. I love you, Mommy. Love you, Mom. Is this seat taken? I brought you something. Stories from a box in a closet. I brought them home from France. I won't be going back there. I... I would like you to read them. I'd like you to have them. They were always meant for you.
