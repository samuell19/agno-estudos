Moments slowly turn into memories painful memories that hurt for some time But nothing leaves a deeper wound that a forgotten memory that resurfaces as a new reality Just like no battle is ever won alone I could never have the honour of becoming a colonel without the sacrifice of the many martyrs Those martyrs who laid down their lives on the battlefield many year ago on this very day So I would like to pay my respects and homage to all those martyrs before I take on my new responsibilities as a Colonel to the future colonel Cheers... Children, solve the riddle in your chits [children giggle] What are you looking for? I can fly like a bird yet I draw no breath. Who am I? [Aunty Laughs] Thanks I guess I got a difficult riddle mamma Aww, but no excuses sweetie Atleast give it a try Aunty, not fair. You can’ t help her Sorry Sanah! Great food, Jhanvi Vishwa you are very lucky, you have a wife like Jhanv That I am Although if the Kebabs didn't taste so good i'm sure you would feel differently [Everyone laughs] I had been after her since our college days, just for these kebabs Who placed this Statue of god here? Here we go again about Vastu This is a very inauspicious direction, the direction of death But isn't god everywhere? Why do you go on about these things? It was fine over there That is a very inauspicious direction according to Vastu You know Vastu is actually a science that people like you have turned into superstition How does it matter if God’s statue is in the north or south, God is still God How does it matter Aunty? What are you doing Sanah? Show that to me Papa who is that in the picture? Not important Eat your dinner What happened? Nothing One for the road? How about that The party was fun I think everybody enjoyed What do you say? Are you still upset about the photograph? You told me you had burned all of it Weren’t hose your words? Burnt and Buried the past Maybe I left out one or two photographs, what’s the big deal? t’s not about the photographs, but the question that sanah asked me Vishva, you’re acting like I gave the photograph to Sanah You know very well that even I don’t want Sanah to find out about our past But what she asked today was exactly about that past I know she asked but we have to answer her questions You will have to give her the answers, not me Vishva...

No, not really It’s a request Dr.Masood I'll meet him but please keep Janhvi out of this I don't think that will be of any help He has just been taking Jhanvi’s name When do I have to go?

Have you come to meet him? How is he? Is he going to make a full recovery? Yes there is a lot of improvement after meeting you A lot has changed after he met you He ate a little too But he doesn’t let anyone touch him so we are taking it easy But he is looking good Even I want him to recover quickly Anyway , I will always there to help you Jhanvi , I am very proud of you You are a brave girl I’m an army officer’s daughter and wife I'll take your leave How many times have I told you to stay away from me Shhhh Keep quiet You can tell me whatever you like but I know you actually want to be with me It’s all in your head You know i’m married Now leave me Your husband is going to die very soon at the border And then you will come running back to me Why don’t we just cut the chase Leave me this instant Sir Sir, the doctor has sent this for you Take this May I shave you ?

It doesn't make any sense This can't be a frostbite Gita clean this up and bandage it properly Listen Vishwa you cannot walk in this condition Get him a wheelchair gita, please Please doctor, I can manage Is there anything I can do to help? have you forgotten your manner? Aren't you supposed to salute your superiors? I haven’t Forgotten a thing Ateet you look so different Can I Steal Jhanvi for a few moments? I need to speak with her in private For old times sake You both are the only reason I returned Our fate was to suffer in loneliness Our fate was to suffer in loneliness it was also our fate to fall in love To suffer in loneliness I want to meet Sanah Yes Of course Why don’t you recover first and then you can meet her We are like footprints in the sand at dawn We are like footprints in the sand at dawn Vishwa, I’m going to pick sanah up, ok? How did that happen to you? How did you get hurt? Do you want to go to the hospital? No, there’s no need It’s just a reaction with the medicines I can take care of myself Did you meet Ateet? Yeah What did he say? No much. He just asked after Sanah and me Im worried about how Sanah will feel when she finds out the truth here were times when you slipped up and others when I failed you It was our fate to repay these debts in the matter of hearts [kids giggle] What happened dear? You’re bleeding! Have some water Does that boy bother you often? You should have faced him after all you are an army officer’s daughter and fear doesn’t suit you at all Next time you fight back He won’t be able to hurt you again understood? Why aren’t you saying anything? Mamma has told me not to talk to strangers But I’m not a stranger, I’m… Sanah! What are you doing? How did you get hurt? It’s just a scratch She thought i was some stranger Sanah, where is your science project file? It’s in the classroom Didnt I see this officer in a photograph who is he? He is your father’s friend Now go and get your file Go Why did you lie to her? I’ll explain this to you later Now is not the right time to discuss this What is there to discuss here? Why does she not know that I’m her father? Vishwa is Sanah’s father, now Are you mad? Vishwa is the only father Sanah has ever known What else could I have told her? We all thought you were dead What other lies have you been telling yourself? That you love Vishwa I care for you but our situation has changed now But the truth hasn’t changed The truth could destroy Sanah’s life and I will do everything to protect her from it Ateet i have moved on, I think you should too Captain Ateet Rana has accused you of sabotaging operation panther What ? According to him you intentionally gave him the wrong coordinates All those men lost their lives because you put the entire platoon in danger Only Nayab Kukuri and you managed to make it out alive And Nayab Kukuri died at the hospital That’s utter rubbish sir I don’t think it was a Coincident that only these two returned alive from the operation I only stayed back to give a cover firing otherwise it was a suicide mission So you think Shooting your own captain is cover fire? Sir, he is falsely accusing me Captain Ateet you are accusing a High ranking officer of treason I was injured when I returned from the ambush The then Major Vishwakarma shot at me from point blank range This son of a bitch is lying sir Colonel mind your language I’m sorry sir As I have clearly written in my report, Captain Rana was killed after he took a bullet from the enemy and fell in the pit There is a difference between writing clearly and writing truthfully Sir, the truth is that after is his dead, or going missing in action or whatever this wife and daughter moved in with me And now they don’t want to return to him And He’s trying to get back at me like this I would never let personal issues interfere with army matters Sir he.. Captain Ateet Whatever you are saying is just a blank allegation as of now Isn't there anyone who can corroborate your allegations? Do you think it was possible for me to have survived all these years all alone, Sir? Who is he ? and where is he? Sir he won’t come in from of everyone If he does he might kill Colonel Vishva What do you think you are doing? What are you going to do about it Complain about me in your letter to your husband? Everyday soldiers are killed by the enemy’s bullet And it will be your husbands turn soon If he doesn’t die at the hand of the enemy then I’ll kill him myself In the end you will have to come to me So why not now? Are you mad? Leave me Sir Sir I need to draw some of your blood for the blood test I think it’s a power cut, sir let me go check Who’s there? Have you already accepted defeat? That bastard Vishwa First he got my entire platoon killed and now he has taken my family away from me. No everyone gets a second chance You have got one to right all the wrongs anhavi's says she worries about me Worry not love She doesn’t love me anymore Says she won’t tell Sanah about me What can i do about this? You don’t need to do anything He will come to you himself All you have to do is show Jhanvi Vishwakarma's true nature I’ll take care of the rest Vishwa juice Give i’ll help you No it’s ok Oh god Vishwa this is just getting worse So you finally noticed Vishwa I genuinely didn’t know about this Let’s go to Doctor Masood There is no need to be so concerned you might run short of it with you ex husband Hadn’t you people asked for my help? you don’t like it then I won’t go to see him I should be thankful to you actually You answered my question about who you’d pick between your past and present This has nothing to do with what Ateet… -Good morning people What are you doing here? Sanah Sanah ? What are you doing here? This is my family, My world I should be asking you the same question. Just get the hell out of here Who made you a colonel when you can’t even walk properly? I guess Sanah is here to see me excuse me Hi Sanah? How are you my darling? I got you some chocolate Don’t look to your mother for approval, she can’t distinguish between right and wrong Keep this Today, Daddy will drop you to school Put Sanah down There is not need to yell When the truth is revealed the very people you are protecting will push you out of their lives Am I right Sanah? Forget meeting Sanah or janhvi, I’ll kill you if you even mention their names I know that Mamma -Come here sweetie Hari take her to school -Yes ma’am Now listen carefully to me both of you The question is not about whom I will pick but about whether u can leave both of you for sanah And the answer is yes I know very well what is right and wrong for my daughter You heard that Get the hell out of here Jhanvi, I’m increasing Vishwa’s doses I can’t understand How Vishwa came to have these war wounds Even I can’t detect the cause An the IVP is quiet normal because, you know Stop this nonsense , what is wrong with you This is not nonsense Did you know that a ward boy died under mysterious circumstances yesterday, at the hospital I’m doing this to protect you and put his soul to rest This is for my protection? Come on! Use this holy water for the prayer Many lose their lives for no good reason at war Many don’t even get a respectful burial I think it is only right to pray for them and their families Not at all Now can we do some work? Jhanvi this increased dosage will make Vishwa very drowsy Try to keep him away from drink and alcohol I’ll try. Ok Take care Are you angry with me? Im getting late I did what I had to for Sanah and you If it was your intention to scare Sanah then congratulations you have succeeded What will Sanah go through when she finds out the truth Well I hope your accusations are proven false Bullet shells? Sanah is collecting these What? I asked her where she got them from She told me her father gave those to her Vishwa? That’s not possible aunty He would never do that Jhanvi this is serious Sir it was never my intention to shot Brigadier Sardar Singh I was defending myself Yourself? But from who? Sir, you would never believe me Speak up Sir i have been seeing dead soldiers and today one of the attacked me Ghosts? At least come up with something better Sir I told you you wouldn’t believe me Sir, Vishwakarma has been prescribed some heavy medicines which might lead to hallucinations Doctor please be careful when you are prescribing medicines Sir the medicines are correct, you can check is you like I think he need a psychiatrist Sir, why don’t you ask him what he was doing in the archive room Now I have started wondering if Ateet was telling the truth after all Sir i need… An inquiry committee will looking into this matter Until then Colonel Vishwakarma will be kept under medical and military observation, and we recommend psychiatric treatment We order him to surrender his arms by noon tomorrow Who’s there? Who’s there? Sanah how many times have I told you that you aren’t allowed to watch TV while eating? Ma please, it’s the last episode and i’m almost done with my dinner You haven’t even eaten properly Come to the kitchen i’ll feed you properly Ten minutes Where is your father? In the dining room Ok. Last episode understood Vishwa has anyone been to our house recently? I’m talking to you and where is Hari Bhai? I don’t know What the hell is wrong with you Vishwa? You’ve had too much to drink Think about Sanah at least She’s got you Isn’t that what you said That you could leave me for Sanah You think only you worry about her If you were worried then you wouldn’t have done this What is this? You tell me, you’re the one who put these in sanah’s bag What ? What are you out of your mind? When she was asked in school she claimed her father gave these to her Well ? That bastard! First he ruined my reputation with his false claims, now with sanah.. Come on Vishwa! Not everything has to do with Ateet But it does! And why are you sympathising with him? Has this sympathy reached the bedroom too? You know what, you are disgusting Sanah! Sanah! Can’t you hear me? Tell mummy who gave this to you Vishwa you are hurting her Tell her now or i’ll give you a beating Let me go Go inside You have turned into an animal Sanah Our fate was to suffer in loneliness Our fate was to suffer in loneliness it was also our fate to fall in love To suffer in loneliness Our fate was to suffer in loneliness We shared one heart which throbbed with love for one another But the same heart broke when we parted ways Our fate was to suffer in loneliness it was also our fate to fall in love To suffer in loneliness Our fate was to suffer in loneliness Ateet Hi just came to check on you Are you ok? Yeah And Sanah? Surprisingly she seems to be ok. Ateet honestly whatever has happened... I need at little time to process all this I need some space I understand Let me know if you need anything Hmm I will.. Ateet , Is it true that your platoon was killed because of Vishva? You know the answer to that question you just aren't ready to accept it One more thing What ? You husband is not dead He is alive It’s almost illegible But what is it? These are tags Only soldiers going to war get these It has their name, blood group, such information How did this reach near your house That too where Vishva.. where he died I’ll check old records and let you know Thank you doctor You’re welcome Do you think he was murdered? All i know is that he wasn’t so weak that he would attempt suicide I’ll take your leave [Children murmur] Sorry maam Sanah Sanah Sanah Sanah Sanah Sanah Sanah Mamma! Sanah where have you been? Who gave you this chocolate? Let’s go This file has the list of some martyrs Thank you doctor I’ll just go check on Sanah What are you looking for in this file? Vishva had told me that he sees dead soldiers It could just be the effect of the medicines But listen, today I saw Sanah talking to someone Who was it? I don’t know what it was What? It didn’t look like us at all You’re out of your mind Vishva has fought the enemy many times at the border I just can't believe that he would commit suicide Have you also started believing in ghosts? Ateet had spoken of another survivor He said that if that man ever saw Vishva he would kill him Sanah! Sanah! Sanah open the door! Sanah open the door! Sanah open the door please You think that person has some connection with the dog tag? I’m not completely sure These tags are my only clue Aunty, what’s happened? Jhanvi, I think both of you should come and stay with us for a few days. Why? I don’t think it is safe for you to stay here alone I think there is an evil shadow on this house Just come with us Aunty this is my house I won’t live here in fear. Jhanvi don’t be stubborn Just think about Sanah But Leaving the house is not a solution Ok fine. If you don’t want to leave dont but i m going to take Sanah with me and that’s final Oh why do you look so weary? Our fate was to suffer in loneliness It’s nothing, Sanah’s vacations start from tomorrow so i thought why doesn’t she come and stay with us for a while Brilliant Idea It will be good change for both Sanah and I Sanah, there is a lot of ice cream waiting for you. Really uncle? Huge Tubs Promisse? But you have to share with me Come Please keep this talisman, I have given you, with you at all times, Janhvi. Ok? And take care of yourself Namaste Jhanvi ma’am is that you? Please come in Thank you You look exactly like he described you in letters Who? Nayab? But I have never met him Ateet Sir never tired of talking about you He was very fond of Nayab One moment Please see this Nayab wanted me to be just like you Nayab used to write to you? Yes Did he tell you about the battle Why what happened? An officer killed an officer An officer killed an officer Ma, ma please calm down - An officer killed an officer Please let her tell me Please tell me the truth Look, I don’t want to lie to you but I don’t have the courage to tell you the truth This is his last letter Read it only if you have the courage to face the truth Tiger come in Tiger Tiger over are you sure these are the right coordinates ?

Why? Do I not have the right to be with my family? What’s the problem? Please let things be the way they are They will never find out the truth about me Nayab, Nayab, Nayab, Nayab, Nayab, Hey, Can you check who is at the door Good evening ma’am You? I’m here for Sanah Sanah?

It feels so odd to get invited to your own house Some wine? Ateet I’m really sorry I just can’t believe that Vishwa kept me in the dark for all these years I can only imagine what you went through Anyone in your position would have believed Vishwa He didn’t just trick you but he also betrayed his men And he has been punished for that Anyway.

I have had this for a very long time At that time i thought i would gift this to you on our anniversary but I never got the chance to Yeah, It’s really beautiful Why don’t you help me with it Is nayab not going to come?
