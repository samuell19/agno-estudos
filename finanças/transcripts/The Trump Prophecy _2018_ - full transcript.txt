Reports of buildings collapsed along the coastline. One levy is broken, the storm surge continues to pound the coastline.

Engine one will establish fire and tackle it. Advancing a one and three quarter inch attack line. We are (drowned out by fire roaring) Adjunct command. (dramatic music) - [Firefighter] Move move.

I got doors left and right of hallway, Delta side. Going left, child's room, alert all crews we're looking for potential young victim. Smoke's getting thick.

It's going to be okay. I'm here to help you alright. There you go. I've got the child and I'm moving out. You're gonna be okay, you're safe now. It's gonna be alright. - My baby brother, he's still inside. - [Firefighter] Be advised we have reports of a third victim inside, let's go, let's go. Command division two, heading to second floor. Request more personnel for the ceiling, in search of the second victim. - [Firefighter] Command safety, the room on the Charlie Delta side, the structure is showing signs of failure, collapse imminent. Order all personnel to evacuate the structure. All fire operation channels.

Closet clear. (alarm blaring) - All companies evacuate the structure and standby for par. (fire roaring) (heavy breathing) - [Firefighter] Dear God. Division two to command, found the boy. Non-responsive. (somber music) (firetruck beeping) (doors slamming) - Today of all days, why'd it have to be a kid? I've got four girls, today's my oldest's birthday. - Well Four girls, that's out of my league Bri. Tell her happy birthday. (tense music) (breathing heavily) (alarm blaring) (men shouting) (radio chatter drowned out) - We'll be alright. 20 years will be long enough. - Yeah but 25 would give us a bigger pension. - Do you want to talk about it? - I know I can't do it. Not the level the job requires it's not in me. - Take some time off, we'll figure something out. - I've got about four months sick leave and vacation time saved up. - Perfect, we'll start there. - You miss being a dispatcher? - It was okay for the time. - I never met a fire dispatcher as gorgeous as you. - Well, you're not so bad yourself, fireman. - I couldn't do this without you, you know that right? - Right now I've got to get to work. The judge is waiting on me. What are your plans for the day? - I was thinking I might clean up the bass boat. - That's ambitious. - Yeah, it'll take my mind of fire trucks. It's been in the shed since pops died, I thought I might use it. Maybe I'll sell it. - Hmm. Good luck with that. Well we wouldn't have to move the cars around in the morning so I could actually get out of the driveway. Love you. (door closing) (garage door rattling) - Time to clean up our boat pops. (gentle upbeat music) (laughing) Miss you pops. Oh that hat. (creature growling) What's happening to me? (tense dramatic music) - Open. Deep breaths. Until recently nobody knew what PTSD was. - Well a lot of guys at the department have had the same symptoms. - I don't want to label you, so let's just try some medication at first. - Like what? - An SSRI, something to help stabilize you for six months or so, then we'll see what that does. - I've got four months saved up right. - Yeah. - I want to take it all now. - Well that's your prerogative. - And when I come back on January one, I'll have made my 20 years. - You're thinking of retiring? - If I said I wasn't I'd be lying. - Mark, it's your time, you've earned it. See you the first of the year. - Thanks Chief. - Hey, happy holidays. (gentle upbeat music) (water spraying) - There. - There's a spot. (she squeals) Sorry, I didn't. - Got it, alright. Looks good. You going to the hardware store. - Yeah, you got it. - I don't know, I thought I had it, I gave it to you but I can't see it. Looks really good babe. - [Mark] Yeah, it's not gonna stay. - Alright, looks great. Are you high fiveing me? - [Mark] No. (laughing) (breathing heavily) (alarm wailing) (shouting) (fire roaring) - What is it, what is it? This pen is real, this pen is real. These dreams are not real. (papers rustling) I am Mark Taylor, firefighter. - Honey, honey, it's after 10 sweetie. - Yeah okay, yep. (yawning) (somber music) (breathing heavily) (fire exploding) He was just a little boy, why would God allow that to happen? Why are you still up? - I couldn't sleep. - I'm not taking those pills. ♪ Hard to say your feelings like this ♪ ♪ Look at life like a something you missed ♪ ♪ And you counting days until you found it out ♪ ♪ Take a minute, let it all sink in ♪ ♪ Won't you hold you breath, count to 10 ♪ ♪ And hope to God that you somehow make it out ♪ ♪ When it's crushing down, who do you look for ♪ ♪ Where do you go when it's crushing down ♪ ♪ When it's crushing down ♪ Who do you look for, where do you go ♪ ♪ When it's crushing down ♪ Hard to say if it's worse then this ♪ ♪ But pretending like it doesn't exist ♪ ♪ And thinking how you can find yourself ♪ ♪ Slow it down I know it's common sense ♪ ♪ But it's only better when I just give in ♪ ♪ And remind yourself how you feel right now ♪ ♪ When it's crushing down, who do you look for ♪ ♪ Where do you go when it's crushing down ♪ ♪ When it's crushing down who do you look for ♪ ♪ Where do you go when it's crushing down ♪ - You sure about this? - Never been more certain about anything? - I guess what I'm asking is have you prayed about it? - The truth.

Listen I can't explain it, I just feel like God's telling me to do something different. - Mark I know you're a man of faith - It's a big decision. - Have you prayed on it? - To tell you the truth Chief, it's been a long time since I prayed. Kind of forgot how. - Mark, prayer is the strongest, most powerful tool you've got. All you've gotta do is talk to him. - Yeah I know. - I'll be praying for you.

Maybe I should sing bass. (laughing) - Maybe we need a second opinion. - I don't know. Maybe. (gentle music) - Mark. Have a seat. We got your tests results back quicker then usual. - Go ahead I can take it. - Mark, this isn't all in your head. You have an extremely low thyroid, you have severe adrenal burnout, you have the hormones of a 70 year old. With numbers like yours I.. I don't know how you're getting out of bed. - I'm not, most of the time. - I want to work on a plan to restore your health, physically, mentally and spiritually. This is not an overnight fix. - Well, got all the time in the world. - Tell me something, how did you cope with the daily rigors of being a firefighter? It's okay, you came to us for help, this is where it begins. - My job as a fireman was to react calmly using rescue protocol. When I click into survival mode it means building up a wall around my emotions. - I can see that. - Dealing with death and injury every day and running toward danger constantly, I don't have time to think about it. You can't afford to have feelings about it, it'll get you killed. - That's a pretty heavy burden to bear. - That's what we were trained to do. - But still you have the emotions. I mean the trauma happens, unfortunately how we cope with it can become the prison that we get stuck in. - What do I do? - Well that's where God's grace comes in. His doing what we're not able to do. Tuning into his voice will help quiet what's raging inside of you. (cheering and shouting on TV) - [Male On TV] Eventually it'll age, it'll sag and it'll wrinkle.

(breathing heavily) What was it? - Something had a hold of my throat, it was choking me. - What were you trying to say? - Jesus. It was trying to take my voice. - We're gonna get through this, we will. - I love you. - I love you too. - Another wild dream this morning. Is this what PTSD is all about? - Lord I know that you can hear me and I am, I am begging you. Lord please I cannot do this alone. I need you to heal him. (crying) Lord please. (breathing heavily) - Come on. Come on! I'm not afraid of you. (gentle uplifting music) I woke up on the floor, flat on my back in a cold sweat. I think I saw God. Lord says this to Cyrus, his anointed. who's right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before. To disarm kings, to open the doors before him, and the gates will not be shut. I will go before you and level the uneven places. I will shatter the bronze doors and cut the iron bars in two. (fire roaring) - [Trump On TV] The fact is money is being drained out of this country at an alarming rate. 350 billion this year from China, alone. Four billion from (drowned out by music) (gasping) Every country they all make good deals. I'm concerned that we're going to go over the abyss. We have incompetent leadership, we have people who have no clue, either that or they're very evil. I don't think they're evil I think they have no clue. - God said "you're hearing the voice of a President." "President Trump." Spirit of God told me of your chosen this man Donald Trump for such a time as this. For as Benjamin Netanyahu is to Israel. So shall this man be to the United States of America. - This is intriguing, I don't know what to think of it either. Mark I want to refer you to one of my colleagues. Dr Don Colbert, as you know I'll be closing my practice soon and I'll be taking a new position at the hospital, he's had some noted success treating patients with PTSD. - Well thanks Dr Vander, for everything you've done for me. - You're a very special person, and I'm not sure how to make sense of what all's happening with you. But I get the impression that God is doing something. - Thank you. - Mark Taylor. Right this way Mr. Taylor. - Hey Mark, thank you Carla. Come on in. I've read your charts from Dr. Vander, and reviewed the tests we ran last week. - Looks like there are several things going on here. - We'll I've read your book, I don't think this is all diet, exercise and water. - Well not entirely but it's a key factor during the initial stages of the treatment of the route causes of PTSD. When you finish this program I think you'll be a different man. - I, uhh I have very graphic dreams. - I've read about that in Dr. Vander's report. What kind of dreams? - A lot of nightmares, where I'm struggling and fighting. - That's interesting. (chuckles) - Yeah. Sometimes I have good ones where I get a visit from an angel. - Hmm, they ever say anything? - You don't think that's crazy? - No, dreams are important. They can give us a window to what's going on inside. Not all of them but most have some kind of insight to give us. - Sometimes I think that God's talking to me. - Hey, how'd it go with Dr. Colbert? - I like him, yeah he ran some tests and I'm gonna go back next week for a follow up. - Did he have any initial thoughts? - He wants me to drink a boat load of filtered water. - That's it, drink water. - Yeah. - Huh. (breathing heavily) - It's okay. It's okay. - [TV] David Rubey CBN News in Boston at Romney headquarters. Mitt Romney got closer then John McCain did four years ago - Thanks. - [TV] But clearly the anti-Obama vote was just not enough and now there'll be questions as to whether or not Mitt Romney was really the right candidate all along. - I don't get it, how can any of this be real. The man never even tried to run. - Trump was never taken seriously. Maybe it is real, but it's just not what you think it is. - I'll tell you what I think, I think I'm going completely crazy. - Why don't you let Dr. Colbert take a look at your journal. - When the time's right maybe I will. - I am officially running for President of the United States and we are going to make our country great again. - I've always kept a journal. - Can I have a look? - Let me see. I got this one in 2011. It's kind of strange huh? - Do you mind if my wife has a look at this? - I actually printed off a copy for yah. - She's a keen sense for interpreting things like this. - Yes I'll put her on the schedule tomorrow. [Beep] Let me call you back. - [Colbert] Honey step into my office please. - I'll be right in. - Mary this is Mark Taylor, he's a new patient. Mark, meet my wife Mary. - Nice to meet you Mark. - You too. - Mark copied this from his journal, I'd like for you to take a look at it. - The Command-in-Chief Prophecy. - I told him it was kind of strange. (laughing) - The interesting thing is he got that in April 2011. - Hmm, I'll take a look at it. - April 28th 2011, Commander-in-Chief. The spirit of God says I have chosen this man, Donald Trump for such a time as this. For as Benjamin Netanyahu is to Israel so shall this man be to the United States of America. ♪ I'll call your name and turn from my old ways ♪ ♪ A sudden change leads me to your grace ♪ - Mind if I come in. - Come in. - Sure. - Mark, this is good. - You think so. - I do, it has that rhythm to it when the Holy Spirit is bearing witness to the truth. At least it does to me. I think you have to let the whole world know about this. - What's so strange to me is that I got this in 2011, and it felt so distinct and real. Trump didn't even run. - And that was four years ago. - Well, all I know is that it has that rhythm of truth to it, at least it does to me. You know, I think God is up to something. Hey, how about we pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this message of hope and we know you have a plan because you are in control of everything, Father we come to you for your guidance for Mark and for us as we seek your will. Show us your way dear Lord Amen (energy pulsating) (uplifting music) - Lord I need you, forgive me, I can't fight this battle on my own. Please Lord, speak to me. (indiscernible muttering) Please, please. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. - Hey mom, I'm at a conference what's up? - DJ do you remember the Commander prophecy I sent you? - Yeah sure, what about it? - I felt the Holy Spirit saying I needed to get involved somehow, I have no idea what that means but somehow I think you might. - And how am I supposed to know about this? - The Holy Spirit gave me this distinct sense that I should call you and you would know what to do. So I called. DJ, are you still there? - Mom, let me call you back. - Mom, I just got an idea. - Yeah? - Go to Second Chronicles seven, 14. Read that to me. - Okay. Second Chronicles, Second Chronicles. If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. - There's your answer. - So? - This is a call to prayer. You need to start a national prayer chain. - What? - You're gonna talk to all the ministries, and all the leaders you know, and mobilize them for prayer. - But D.J.. - No buts. You know all kinds of people. God is telling us to pray for our country. Its leadership and those in authority over us. That's what we need to do. - Oh my goodness. - Start praying every day. On a conference call-in number. Everybody agreeing for the will of God to be done. For his intervention. For this election. - This is perfect. Okay, I gotta go, bye. - Mom, mom. - Yeah? What is it, son? - Just so we're clear. I've never really been a Trump fan. - No worries. Neither have I. (soft instrumental music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, George. - Hi Mary, what a nice surprise. - George, are you still leading that prayer group at your school? - Yeah, why? - Well. We need a special prayer for Donald Trump. - You mean the billionaire with the big orange hair? (laughing) - That's him. - Yeah. I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one. I'm in the middle of a game, and my guys are gonna kill me. Alright, I gotta go, bye. - George. George? Pastor Bob, this is Mary Colbert. (light instrumental music) I need to talk to you about an intercessory prayer chain. - That's great. Who are you praying for? - Donald Trump. - Oh, well there's someone who needs a lot of prayer. (laughing) - Well we believe God has chosen him to be the next President of the United States. Pastor Bob? (phone buzzing) Hey Billie, that was fast. - Sorry, I left my phone in the car while I was shopping. What's up? - I think the lord wants me to start a national prayer call, and I want you to be a part of it. - Okay, what does he want us to pray for? - Well, not what, who. Donald Trump. To be the next President of the United States. I'm going to call it the Nation Builder's Prayer Call, and I'm contacting everybody I know. - Mary, there's something I need to tell you. I've never been a fan of Donald Trump. (bright music) - Pops. - Hello. Welcome. Need some help? - Thanks, I got it. - Ladies and gentlemen, our boarding is now complete. Please takes your seats as we prepare the cabin for takeoff. - Hey, come on, please. - Sir, are you okay? - I'm sorry. Excuse me, I'm so sorry. - Excuse me. I have a very important phone call at 9:00 a.m. It's a national prayer call. - Okay. - I'm just gonna go right in there. Don't be alarmed. - Wait, ma'am? We're about to take off. Ma'am. Okay, okay, I got it. Thank you so much. Yeah, sit down. Yeah, I'll do it, thank you. Come on. Ah. - Good morning, everyone. I understand there's thousands of us. Praise God. Father, we thank you. We praise you. You're going to do what you said you're going to do. - Ma'am, could I get your drink order? - What is going on in that bathroom? (man giggling) Is there somebody praying in there? - Could be, could be. It wouldn't be the first time. - Well it's just so loud. - Okay, you know what? I'll check on it for you, okay? Would that be alright? - Thank you. - Alright. (knocking on door) - Ma'am, is everything okay? - And seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways. - We're about to take off pretty soon. - Then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins. - [Flight Attendant] You need to get back to your seat. - And will heal their land. Father, we praise you, we thank you. - Okay. (giggling) - We know you're in control. - A passenger's on a conference call, and she'll be out soon. Now what can I get for you? - I'll have a double Tanqueray martini. Straight up, not dirty. And three olives. - Right away. (sighing) - Did you get everything taken care of in there? - Yep, we're covered. - Awesome. - Praise the lord. - Amen. - Oh. (giggling) Stop it. - That's great. Yes, yes yes. That's wonderful. Could you hold on just one second? Thank you. Mary, you're gonna wanna take this call. - Hello? (bright music) Yes? Absolutely. Sure. The 10th? Okay. Alright. I've got you down. Yes, thanks for calling me back. Exactly. Well part of this prophecy, I was for Ted Cruz. (people chattering) Hi, Mr. Clements, how are you? Ollie, hi. That's right. It's for real. (phones ringing) (people chattering) I'll get it, I'll get it. Hello? (phones ringing) (laughing) Do you know what a Shofar is? - You mean the Jewish horn? - That's right. They used it as a sound for battle, and to praise God for the victory. I believe God wants us to use it on election day. - Really? - Really. - So you gave out our office phone numbers so people could call in about that? - Give me that one, and just start over with a new list. I got it, I got it. Hi, thank you for calling. Wonderful. Oh my gosh, we're glad to have you at this part. Okay, bye bye. (suspenseful music) This is going a lot better than I thought. Alright, let's keep going. (vacuum whirring) - [Marco Rubio] Build the wall the way you built Trump Towers, you'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. (crowd cheering) - Mari Jo, could you come in here for a second? You've got to see this. - [Marco Rubio] It's not a soundbite, it's a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump Polish workers, you'll see it. - What's this? - [Marco Rubio] The second thing about the trade war, I don't understand 'cause your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you're gonna be starting a trade war against the wrong sides-- (crowd cheering) - [Trump] You know what? - [Marco Rubio] Why don't you make it clear? - [Trump] Devalue their character. - [Marco Rubio] Well then make them in America. - [Trump] It makes it impo-- Well you don't know a thing about business. - [Marco Rubio] Well make 'em in America. - [Trump] You don't know anything about it 'cause you're a-- - Is this really possible? - It's unreal is what it is. (men arguing in background) (crowd cheering) - [Marco Rubio] So I don't know anything about, you know what? You started a University, it was a fake University. - [Trump] First of all, first of all-- - [Marco Rubio] That was a fake University. - [Trump] That's called-- - [Marco Rubio] There are people-- - [Moderator] Hold on, one at a time, Mr. Trump. - [Marco Rubio] That borrowed 36,000 dollars to go to Trump University, and they're suing 'em now. 36,000 dollars. (suspenseful music) - [Mary] I'm concerned. - Okay. Let's talk. - Well, we're getting a great response. But I'm-- (melancholy music) I'm worried at times I could be overselling this. You know how excited I get. (giggling) What if I'm wrong? They're going at him tooth and claw in those debates. What if he doesn't get confirmed at the Republican Convention? - Mary. All we can do is pray. God tells us to pray for all men. For kings, for all in authority. To honor and respect them. That's what he's called us to do. If we do our Second Chronicles seven, 14 part, he will hear from Heaven. And heal our land. - Thank you. Thank you. Lord. As we answer your call to pray, please give me a confidence to know that we are doing your will, and not our own. Hey, Mark. - Mary. - I didn't expect to see you today. Doctor Colbert says you're doing really well. - Well, in fact, I just went to the gym before I came here today, so. - Wow, your voice does sound stronger. - I think God is healing me. - I don't believe there's any think to it. You look great. Hey, how about leading a prayer call sometime soon? - Sure. I'd like that. - You're on, good. We'll see you later. - Thank you very much, Mark. - Thanks, Jimmy. A lot of memories in this box. - Well, I'm sure he's gonna appreciate it. - Have fun on the water. - Thank you. Here you go, son. You get a tackle box, I get a boat. (engine revving) - Good morning, prayer warriors. As you know, we'll be blowing the Shofar on election day, so I've invited a special guest to explain the significance of this event. - Are we ready? Okay. Alright, everyone. The Shofar is called the voice. Blowing it is not a ritual. On your own, it's merely the sound of a ram's horn. But when your voice is joined together with God's voice, something shifts in the spirit realm. It becomes a supernatural weapon. It's a declaration by God's people. That we are putting him on the thrown over our nation. - That we may truly be one nation under God. - Exactly. We're proclaiming liberty over this nation.

I'm Lorie Johnson. Election day 2016 is finally here, and polls show a very tight race. National polls show Hillary Clinton ahead of GOP rival Donald Trump, but the two candidates are in a dead heat in several key battleground states. Sharlene Aron has the story. - [TV] Election day voting officially kicked off at the stroke of midnight, as it always does in the small community of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. Clinton has a slight lead in the average of the most recent polls from the last few days. Still, the race has gotten tighter. - Either I can't see what God is really doing here, or I've completely lost my mind. - [TV] He needs to get the 278-- - From the looks of things, it's gonna take a miracle for Trump to win. - [TV] Late last night, the two candidates-- - It's in God's hands. I've had all I can take. - [Trump] So it's now officially, Tuesday, November eighth. (crowd cheering) - [Hillary Clinton] I gotta tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. - So there were so many states that were considered battlegrounds. The state for example of Pennsylvania. The state of North Carolina. The state of Florida. - [Reporter] And on and on. (phone beeping) I've got 14 states, Pat, were within six points or so in the polls. - [Pat] Those boundaries-- - Lord. I don't really understand this. But I trust you. And I know that you have a plan. And thy will be done. (clock ticking) - If we drill down a little farther, in Florida, Donald Trump wins. (suspenseful music) And why does he win? (laughing) - Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. - Okay, honey. Keep praying, keep praying. There's still a lot of night to go, yet. - [Newscaster] Yeah, she did fine. That wasn't the issue. The issue is, or I should say, the issue for Hillary Clinton is, is that Donald Trump has over-performed. (light music) (yawning) - After the most amazing election, Donald Trump has made history, shocking the political experts. - Mark, Mark. Mark. Mark. Mark, wake up. Mark, he won. Donald Trump won the election. It was called at 2:30 a.m. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's all over the news. Clinton officially conceded at 2:35. - Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together. To all Republicans, and Democrats, and Independents across this nation, I say, it is time for us to come together as one united people. - It's a miracle. (News reporter chattering) - It's certainly a testament to the power of prayer. - [News Reporter] And in the process, turning the American political map into a sea-- - That's the trifecta, Pat, that he needed, and then he needed to penetrate Hillary Clinton's-- - God did it. It's a miracle. - That it is. - [Reporter] You know what's interesting, Pat. In Michigan, which is fascinating, Macomb County, you know that county. That's the Reagan Democrats out there. - I can't believe this. - What? - There's a video of people in Israel, who heard about this American woman leading a grand blowing of the Shofar. Now, they're in the streets of Israel, doing the same thing. (laughing) It's crazy. (reporters chattering) - The spirit of God, it's Israel. Israel. What about Israel? For Israel will be protected by America once again. The spirit says yes. America will once again, stand hand in hand with Israel. And the two shall be as one.

I mean, it's very clear. My people, who are called by my name. That means those of us who are believers. We call ourselves Christians. We have an obligation to pray for our country. I certainly do every night. - What's really interesting about that passage from the Bible is that it says, if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face. So he's not saying all of America. He's not saying all of the world. He's saying, my people. - The promise is Chronicles that Solomon gave, that is so profound, is that if my people, that are called by my name will humble themselves and pray. If they'll turn from their wicked ways, then I'll hear from Heaven. And so much of the repentance and awakening and revival, hope of Christians in America is all about what God's gonna do with the un-Christian community. How he's gonna change them. When in fact that promise has nothing to do with them. It has to do with us. It's how believers respond. It's how believers connect with their President and this moment. That's what determines the healing of the land. And so the real focus of that promise is, believers have got to get their act together if they want to preserve their way of life. - The mandate of the Bible is two-fold. You pray individually. In a closet, away from anyone else. Primarily to find God's will for yourself. God knows what you want before you pray. You pray to build a relationship with the lord. But it also says to pray together. To pray in church, the body of Christ. To pray in small groups. And where three are gathered, he is there with us. So it's both individual and it's collective. - Our founding fathers would often have some of the most critical meetings, when they would accomplish so many things. They would leave those meetings and automatically walk across the street, usually to a religious facility, and have prayer afterwards. And thank the lord for what had just happened. To me, that's where what needs to be restored. Everybody talks about who's the Commander-in-Chief? Commander-in-Chief is still the man upstairs. And unfortunately, on both sides of the aisle, our politicians have forgotten that. They seem to have forgotten that. - Presidents like Adams and Madison would call every year for a national day of prayer and humiliation. And it was observed by the whole nation. - Founding father John Hancock had a great quote. He said, I urge you, by all that's honorable, by all that's dear, by all that's holy, not only that you pray, but also that you act. - In other words, we can't just kick back and passively await redemption to come. We are put in this world to do things, to accomplish things. We are put in this world to partner with God in bringing holiness and sanctity into this material world. - I think it's very important, but I think there's something in that passage that is important for leaders. It says, if you humble yourself. It's one thing to pray. It's another thing to be humble. And the humility that is needed from leadership, so that God can move through them to a nation that is hurting, is needed more today than any other time. We can pray. I love prayer. I'm a prayer person. But at the same time, humility is what God is looking for. He said, if you're humble, I'll find you, actually. And so I think that passage of scripture is famous for prayer, but I want it to be famous for humility. - The salvation for America is the collection of believers. Just enough who will get on our knees, and humble ourselves, and recognize our goal needs to be the maintenance of liberty. - And it all comes back down to Second Chronicles seven, 14. If we want God to hear from Heaven, to forgive our sin and heal our land, there's a checklist that we're supposed to follow. We all know it's to humble ourselves and pray, to seek God's face and not just his hand. But the fourth point, the essential thing that we need to do for God to heal our land is for us to turn from our wicked ways. It's the part most people forget. And if we can turn from our wicked ways, we can make America good again, and make America great again. - You know, at first I didn't quite understand or appreciate the campaign phrase, Make America Great Again. But after pondering it, and after watching President Trump as he goes about his duties as not only the President, but the Commander-in-Chief, I think I understand it now. You know, our founding fathers gave us a Constitutional Republic. And in that Constitution that they left to us, they give us freedoms. Those freedoms are articulated. And I think that what has happened to America over the last few years is we have lost our focus on what those Constitutional freedoms really are. And I think that what Mr. Trump was saying was, that he wanted to help move America back to a focus on, what are our Constitutional freedoms. And he's doing just that. - When I look at making America great again, it's kind of like taking some of the good things that America was in recent decades and bringing them back to the top. - It's important to keep in mind, when you're thinking about what it takes to make America great again, that the key element is spiritual, not secular. It depends upon a common bond of the people, wanting something for each other, not just themselves. And the state of the United States of America in 1776, it was that birth is not destiny. And that all rights come from God. And are not created by government. Government is here to facilitate and protect the rights that God gives us. - Yeah, I think actually, in order to really change America, to make America great again, we're going to have to have a revival of spirituality in the United States. And I see signs of that happening, and starting to happen. - The American values I think that need to be brought back were set forth in the Declaration of Independence. I think we have excellent founding documents. I think they've produced really a stability that no other nation's had. Average nation has a new Constitution every 17 years. We've gone 200 plus years with ours. So when I look at the Declaration that says, number one, there is a God. Number two, that that God gives certain inalienable rights to every individual. Number three, that government exists primarily to protect inalienable rights. And number four, there is a fixed moral law. Then five, the majority wins. The consent of the governed. Those are values that we've seen really disappear, all five of them, in recent years. So bringing those back, which is the basis of the Declaration, Constitution, that's really key to me, having a kind of God-friendly, God-conscious society with limited government that believes it is not God, but it is there to serve the people. - Well, the historical attributes, and the thing I think about the most as far as being restored is, is really when it comes to the Constitution. It seems like the Constitution has really been challenged over the past eight, nine years or so, in many many areas. And I think that part of the challenge that we face is really having the right person on the Supreme Court, who really is going to abide by the Constitution. - And when you move away from those landmarks, and those foundations, now you go on to, the Bible clearly says, matter of fact, if the foundation to be destroyed. What can the righteous do? So when you destroy foundations, you destroy the under pending of what you were built upon. And so we've got to make sure that we restore those kinds of attitudes back in America. - And America's role in the world is literally the guardian of a free order, and it really supports the economic stability of nations that have the gospel preached. And so in a very significant way, making America great again is about preserving the strength of the United States in a very competitive, ideologic conflict of nations. So that as America is strong, democracy can be strong. - So the American economy's influence in the world is quite dramatic. It's the number one economy in the world. It's the largest economy in the world. It has the largest GDP. And because of that, the rest of the world's wealth and the rest of the world's prosperity is dependent upon the United States. We see trade with China. We see trade with Europe. We see all the different trade that we have. In the case of Canada, where I come from, 85% of Canada's trade is with the United States. So the Canadian economy, for example, is totally dependent upon the United States. - It is the American economy is to the world what a tide, an incoming tide is, that lifts all boats. When the American economy is strong, other people from other nations get to sell into this market, which is the wealthiest market in the world. And so it lifts all boats. - 'Cause any time there's a disaster, it's the United States that's first on the scene. Why? Because of our system of free market enterprise, we've been able to create wealth in this nation. And you can't help other people unless you have wealth. And so we should never apologize for the fact that in this country, we know how to create wealth. And we need to know how to use it wisely. - Besides the maintain the peace, providing a marketplace for other economies to be able to sell their goods and services, the United States' greatest contribution to the world are the spiritual aspects of integrity, of proper relationships between government and those governed that we present. - There are many who say that when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. And if we are not strong in our economics, then the rest of the world is gonna suffer tremendously. All you have to do is travel around the world. If anybody want to see what this look like, just travel a little bit around the world, and see the effect of the dollar that it has on other economies. And so, we've got to have a strong dollar. We need to have a strong economy so that we can help. Because the other thing about this nation is we give more than any other nation on the planet. We are the most charitable people on the planet. And so as a result of that, we're taking care of a lot of people around this world that would not have if America was not here. - We go back to the very concept of freedom. America was created to be a society that encouraged freedom at all levels, to include economically. The free market system, capitalism, is what America was founded on. Was people being able to pull themselves up, and with a little courage and some ingenuity and entrepreneurialism, to be able to build their own business, and make their own way, and not have to settle for their circumstances at birth, or their upbringing. - And of course it also is beneficial to the world, not only economically, but in terms of other concerns. For example, when the American economy is strong, and the military is kept strong, piracy all over the world is phased down. Tyrants all over the world are phased down. - A healthy American military is very important to the whole world because we are the only ones that can stand up to some of these despots, dictators, bullies, around the world. No other country, you know other countries-- These socialist countries in Europe, for example, have cut their militaries to the point that they barely have a constabulary force. Because they wanted to put all that money into social programs. And they've become socialist. An American military that can stand against adversaries, that can defend our allies as well as ourselves, is very very critical to the strength of the international community. - We are literally the glue that keeps the peace in the world. And is there a price to pay for that by the American public? Yes, but at the same time, it's necessary. - I've been reporting on the front lines of Israel's history and throughout the Middle East since the year 2000. When President Trump was elected in 2016, you could notice a marked change here in the Middle East. The main reason is because the United States could be trusted to back up its word, and the United States projected strength throughout the region. Something that's respected a great deal. You could sense that in Kurdistan, for the Kurds that the United States would stand behind them. You could see that in refugee camps for persecuted Christians, when they know that the United States would speak up for them. You could notice that in the streets of Tehran, when people went to the streets, and Iranians protested against the tyranny of the Islamic Mullahs, that somebody would speak up on their behalf. So because of strength, because of the United States, standing behind its word, what President Trump has said it would do. It makes a huge change here in the Middle East. It makes its allies more trusted. It makes its enemies more feared. - In the world, there is no greater epicenter than Jerusalem, Israel. And our own United States State Department has done everything that it could to stop Israel from being able to name Jerusalem as their capitol, as far as the United States government is concerned. And recognizing that capitol. Israel's been a state since 1948. I was there for the Independence Day celebration. 70 years, Israel has been a nation. And yet, only Israel has been denied the right to name their own capitol. - Jerusalem has always been the heart and soul of the Jewish people. Even when our ancestors were in exile for 1,900 years. And were unable to ascend to the land, and visit the site of our holy temples. Jerusalem was always in their thoughts and their prayers. - There's a lot of people that say, you know, why Israel? Why does it matter? Not only is it our only democracy in the Middle East, not only is it our best friend in that region. But if you wanna be on the right side of history, you wanna be on God's side. And if God is for Israel, and he is, then I wanna be for Israel. God said that he will bless those that bless them. That we are to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. When I saw that President Trump changed the embassy, and basically said, no, we are going to acknowledge the capitol of Israel as Jerusalem, and move our embassy where it should have been all along. I just, I was cheering. I was actually crying as I was watching those speeches. As they made that dedication. It's just so encouraging. What we need to do is stand with Israel, because God stands with Israel. - One of the greatest principles in the Bible to the Jewish people is found in the Book of Genesis, on chapter 12, where it says that God would bless those who bless the Jewish people. And President Trump in so many practical ways has stood behind Israel, has had its back diplomatically and militarily, and has also moved the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That's a huge diplomat historic, even prophetic statement. Because of the blessing that President Trump has bestowed on the Jewish people, that will reap economic, diplomatic, and even spiritual blessings for the United States. - You know, the uniqueness of Israel in the Bible, and for Christians, is that it represents the promises of God, that he is going to be restoring a people to a land, and he's going to prosper a people in the land. There again, it's an interesting reality. That Donald Trump and Israel have this in common. They have global enemies, that are very much interested in developing a narrative that would destroy them. And so the United States has a covenant relationship in a sense with God, formed out of the founders, and the way in which they approach creating the unique experiment of an American community founded with religious liberty. The only other nation that shares that in common is Israel. - I believe that our relationship with Israel is key. Not only as an ally. But because God said, if you bless Israel, you're gonna be blessed. You can't make it any simpler than that. That's plain and simple for me. - And I believe that one of the other things we need to do is not only to support Israel, but we need to cut off the funding, and the support to the enemies of Israel. Because the enemies of Israel, the same nations that wanna eradicate Israel from off the map, are the same countries that aren't real fond of the United States. - I was privileged to be asked to do election night coverage with David Barton. It's the first time I'd ever done it, and it was the first time that the ministry down in Dallas had ever done it. It was broadcast, I think, on Daystar TV, a number of different channels broadcast it. And we were excited because there was a sanctuary attached to the studio, filled with intercessory prayer warriors. They had been there praying for a long time, and of course there had been many ministries who had asked people to pray for 50 days before the election, or 40 days before the election. And so there's a lot of bathing and prayer. When I came to the studio that night, there's a flat screen TV on the wall in the green room, and when I came in, I was watching the screen, and suddenly I saw all these people rush up to the front of the altar. They went on their face, and they're on their knees, and they were in prayer. And I turned around and asked the people in the green room, who is that? Where is this happening? Because I knew that there was a sanctuary attached to the studio. I assumed that it was in Dallas, Texas. And they said, oh no, that's Jerusalem. And these are believers from China, who came in specifically to be in prayer for the American election. And so they're on their knees, praying, because they knew dependent upon how the election turned out, so too Israel's fortunes could perhaps hang in the balance. - As far as our country is concerned, obviously there's always a lot of times, misconceptions, or everybody have their own idea. And there's nothing wrong with everyone having their own idea. I can disagree with you, you can disagree with me. But in the end, we really have to do what's best for America. Because when you do what's best for your own home, I think it's a positive effect around the country. - God uses our hands and he uses our feet. He uses our minds. (light patriotic music) And so we have to recognize. This is just more than about our happiness. The United States is really a beacon for the world. A city on the hill, so to speak. And so as long as we name the name of our God, and as long as we follow Biblical attributes, America will be strong. - The most important thing we can do for our country is to pray. - My people who are called by my name. - Will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face. - They'll turn from their wicked ways, then I'll hear from Heaven. - And I will forgive their sins, and I will restore the richness of their lands, and of their home. ♪ America, America ♪ America, America ♪ God shed his grace on thee ♪ And crown thy good ♪ And crown thy good ♪ With brotherhood, with brotherhood ♪ ♪ From sea, from sea ♪ To shining, to shining ♪ Shining sea ♪ It was sacrifice ♪ For our freedom ♪ We will stand for the greater good ♪ (light instrumental music) ♪ If my people, meek and humble ♪ ♪ Once again return to me ♪ Come to me, poor, meek and broken ♪ ♪ Falling right down on their knees ♪ ♪ There will be healing ♪ Great healing ♪ There will be healing in the land ♪ ♪ Only if my precious people ♪ Once again return to me ♪ If my people turn away from ♪ Their wicked wicked ways ♪ I will hear from my throne in Heaven ♪ ♪ And will bless them all their days ♪ ♪ There will be healing ♪ Great healing ♪ There will be healing in the land ♪ ♪ Only if my precious people ♪ Turn away from their wicked ways ♪ ♪ If my people call on my name ♪ When their times are full of woe ♪ ♪ I will come to bring deliverance ♪ ♪ Crushing down the mighty foe ♪ There will be healing ♪ Great healing ♪ There will be healing in the land ♪ ♪ 'Cause my people called on my name ♪ ♪ When their times were full of woe ♪ ♪ Oh you pray for your salvation ♪ ♪ When it has already come ♪ Just pray and receive my ♪ My one begotten son ♪ There will be healing ♪ Great healing ♪ There will be healing in the land ♪ ♪ 'Cause you prayed and received my ♪ ♪ My one begotten son ♪ 'Cause you prayed and received my ♪ ♪ My one begotten son
