I am a bodyguard, sir. And bodyguards don't sit. - Not even in the morning? I have to sit in the morning, sir. Bodyguard? Whose bodyguard? Okay. But as long as you are in this classroom... ...consider yourself a student. And quietly be seated here. Sir, i cannot sit next to ma'am. I cannot sit beside her nor in front or at her back. Then sit on my head. But, lovely, please sit down. Okay, ma'am. Look if divya's father wasn't a trustee of this college... ...i would've sent you out by now. Okay, today we shall talk about the challenges of globalization. Now for a better part of the last century... ...the very concept of citizenship has been based... ...despite its many differences has had one thing in common. And for those of us who aren't listening, the very concept... get out. - Bodyguard, sir. Get out of my class. - Bodyguard, sir. I said leave! Wonder when was the last time he smiled. - In 1947. Wow! What a model! Men in black. Really, man. We will at least have to get his uniform changed. But how? Lord, don't wake me up... ...until the morning rays don't fall on my bum. I wish that savita falls asleep on me thinking of me as a mattress. Lovely. Lovely. Leave it. Ma'am, he burnt my bum. Take a look. Aren't you ashamed to use words like bum... ...in front of the ladies? If i don't call it a bum then shall i call it rum, drum... ...chewing-gum, 'pani-kum' or 'humdum'? Lovely, you will find a new pair of pants... ...but i won't find a new pair of my bum. You are not a bodyguard but itch-guard, itch-guard. Look ma'am. I can see your faces through my pants. Look. Look. Because he burnt it. I burnt it? How can i burn it? I was sleeping. Ma'am, go and rest. You have to go to college tomorrow morning. Savita, why are you going to sleep? You don't have to go to college. No uniform from tomorrow. Come on. Sister divya. Sister divya. What happened? Sister divya, come quickly. I will show you something. What happened? - Come on. Come. What happened? Take a look. 1001. 1002. 1003. There is just one way to tighten loose clothes. Exercise with stones... ...and make a body of stone. What will you do with this loose screw? Gone with the wind. New uniform again. See, ma'am. He awakened the tailor at night. Made him work the entire night... ...and got a new uniform stitched for himself. How could i go to college without the uniform? Nude. What? - Nude. You two get ready. Go quickly. We are getting late for college. Mr. Mhatre, we found her. But that bodyguard is with her as well. Oh no. Our entire plan was foiled. He will drive me crazy. We will have to do something about this cement model. Yes. Really - sure thing. And the worst thing is that i can't even tell father. Otherwise he'll call me back. Please do something. I have an amazing idea. Why don't we get him busy somewhere else? Meghna, i have an idea. Call him up repeatedly and convince him that... ...you have fallen madly in love with him. Faster. More energy. Full power, ma'am.
