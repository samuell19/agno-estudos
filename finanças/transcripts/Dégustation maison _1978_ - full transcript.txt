HOUSE SPECIALTY - Hi, Christiane. - Hello, Alain. You're in the area today? A tartlet. By yourself, Dédé? Then make it two. What's going on? Not much. How's hunting season started? Very well - a pheasant and three partridges. Not bad, eh? How about you? I don't hunt. I've been picking mushrooms. I came back with a basketful, so we ate our fill. You ate a few? Anyway, now it's harvest time. This year's going to be first-rate. - Miss Christiane? - Corning! Sunshine, a bit of rain - With the sun and the showers we've had recently - - Yes, Mr. Hamblert? - The same again. - Two tutti-fruttis. - The same thing. How'd your vacation go? We had nice weather. But the crowds! And it was over too soon. But my wife and daughter got some rest. That's the main thing. - That's right. - You have any vacation left? I still have two weeks. Maybe I'll take in some winter sports. - You'll never see me on skis! - A bit of fresh air, though. No need to put on skis. To take it up again at my age - You've skied before? Hey, it's Tailleux! Haven't seen him in a while. Hi, Tailleux! - How's it going, Dédé? - You on vacation too? - Yes. You're always on vacation! Christiane, three more tartlets. I've spent mine on my knees. On your knees? - Laying tile. - When do you reopen? - Next Tuesday. - Not for a week, then. I have to get some hunting in. What kind of tile? Plastic? Depends. Some kind of plastic. Here he is. I'll have a tart, please. Last one, Mr. Prévost. Fine. I'm paying. What do you clean the tiles with? Liquid wax? Oh, no. Three tartlets, Christiane. It's tartlets day! I'll go get some. No, Christiane, please. I'd better go. It's late. I'll only be a minute. No, really. I'm working overtime. What do I owe you? The second round? That's 4.50. See you later, and thanks. See you soon. Bye, Christiane. Doesn't mean we can't have another one. It can't hurt. It may not do us any good, but it won't do us any harm. I'll go get more. They're delicious. Let's have some. Hurry, I need tartlets. Skip the pies. No one wants them today. Tartlets... They should be ready. I'll take them out. I'll be back. Not bad. They look a bit dry. - Ready? - Just adding the finishing touches. Ready to go on your tray. How's your garden doing? It's coming along. - Lettuce doing well? - I just picked some up this morning. - You'll have seedlings soon? - You want some? Here they are! - Better than lettuce! - It was about time! - Yeah, she took her time. Tastes better when you wait. - Was the boss asleep? - The boss? It's only natural. You think pastries just make themselves? Oh, no. You have to work nights. - The hot ovens... - Hi, Christiane. - Hello, Mr. Popaul. See? Christiane won't even buy you a pastry. - How are things? - Fine, fine. How about a game? Here we go! Your customers have left. That's bound to knock a hole in your business. Hello, gentlemen. - Hi, Mimile. - Mimile, how you doing? - Gettin' old. - Great! - Christiane, can I have - - A tartlet? Clubs. Clubs. Spades. I've noticed Mimile is here a lot to see Christiane. What do I owe you? 7.50. - He comes in alone a lot. - Fortune favors a fool. Hello, ladies. What's that on the tray? That's with cherry liqueur. - And this? - That's rum cake. What should we get? What flavor are the tarts? Gin and bitter lemon. Oh, no. I'm sorry, but nothing today. Not a single decent thing in there today. I can't believe it. - I gotta go. - You leaving, Tailleux? I got work to do. My customers... - See you, then. - So long. Hey, that's mine. Don't take that. Clubs. See ya, Tailleux ! Don't bother us. We're playing. And don't eat our pastries. Can't I sit with you? Come on. I don't want you here. Clear out! I pay my way! Calm down, Mr. Prévost. You too - Hey, don't! You've had enough for today. Leave me alone. I'll go see the mayor. See you tomorrow. And don't try anything. See you tomorrow. He's a nasty piece of work. Funny old tearoom. I'm out. He's a good guy, but - Maybe there's something in those tartlets. He's after the girls. And we can be pretty unfriendly. - Christiane, the same again. - No more, Mr. Hamblert. - Another tartlet? - Come on, we're closing. - No more for me, thanks. - Oh, come on! Just a shortbread cookie. At this time of day? Write it down or we won't know. Chrissie, will you join us? Never while I'm working. Come on. Just for me. - Just this once. - Good girl. - Another game? - If you like. Just clubs. The rest are yours. I've only got clubs. You got trumps? Cheers. Chin-chin. To our health. - Hello, Mr. Dédé. - How are you, boss? - Fine, and you? - Very well. Mr. Mimile, how are you? Was it good? - Yes. Have something with us. Oh, no. I'm up to my ears in pastries all day. I understand. And those ovens are so hot. That's right. We'd better close soon. Some other time, eh? Trump. I'm ahead. - How was it, gentlemen? You have a nice stack here! How much do we owe you? Let me see. That's 23. Kill anything? Only time? Maybe you should be going now. Yeah, we'll settle up and be on our way. - You're paying for Mr. Mimile? - All of it. Sixteen francs. There you go, sweetie - 16 francs. I'd better hurry. I'm on my bike, and it's a good haul. Good-bye. I'd kiss you but... you know. Good-bye. See you tomorrow. Be careful. I've got a long way to go. See you, boys. Be careful, Dédé. Take your time. - Evening, sir. - Officer. - You're in a bad way. - I had a pastry! May I see your ID? I don't have ID on me. I don't need ID to eat pastries! You'll have to come with me. Come on. Awful kind of you! Sit down there. Hold the line. I'll put her on. Mom? For you. An order. Just a moment, please. You wanted to place an order? Madame Pigouat. Yes, of course I remember. For a birthday? Twenty people. I suggest bouchées à la reine. With the usual white wine. Yes, you really liked them. And a layer cake? I believe you enjoyed it last time. Yes, of course, as usual. No whipped cream. I recall you don't care for that. Very well. When is this for? Sunday. Is this for delivery? Ah, your daughter will pick it up. Very good. Restored and Digitized by...
