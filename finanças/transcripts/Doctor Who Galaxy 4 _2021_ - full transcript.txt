Okay, but we've got to get off here somehow! It's imperative we leave at once! Why is that that? The Drahvins did say fourteen dawns. Two dawns! Tomorrow is the last day this planet will ever see! We've gotta get back - get Vicki away from the Drahvins! The doors, Doctor! Can we see the scanner? What's that it's got? I wish I knew. Perhaps it's just going to stand guard there. No. No! It's... it's... it's waiting for something. But what? I can't quite see. Hmm. Doctor, I... I think it's holding a couple of wires. LOOK OUT! Doctor? Doctor, where are you? Oh, thank you, my boy. Oh! Oh! I think Guy Fawkes must have been resurrected! Oh, please, Doctor! You all right? Yes, well... Are you all right dear boy, hmm? Yes, fine, thanks. Do you think it's done any damage? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It'd take more than that to get in here. It's all right, Doctor. I think it's just come to investigate. Yes, well, it's going to be disappointed, isn't it? Look! You see! There they go! Look, away into the distance. Empty-handed! Yes, they've given up. Yes! Yes, unless they... they come back with a piece more trouble, I wonder. Come on, we must go. So... so little time. Two dawns, hmm? Two dawns. Come on! Come on! Are you sure you won't eat? No, thank you. It's very good. It looks like leaves to me. It is leaves. Leaves? Is that what you eat? Of course! Eurgh! Everything that lives must eat. They've been gone ages. It must be at least two hours. They'll be back soon. Not if a Chumbley gets them first. They won't allow themselves to be caught. They're much too worried about you. That's why you've kept me here, isn't it? Isn't it? You're safe here. Safe! Exactly. Look! Can't I go and look for them? If they're not back soon, we will go and look for them. Well, let me go now! No, I can't let you do that... because you might all escape in your spaceship. And we need your help. Whether we want to give it or not. Oh, I'm sure that all of you want to help us. Well, we've made it Doctor. You know, this is a pretty strange kind of spaceship. Are you talking to yourself, dear boy, hmm? I was just saying that it's a strange kind of spaceship. Old-fashioned. Yes, I don't think much of it. It's not very well advanced, is it? In fact, as you say, it's old-fashioned. Yes! I don't think these Drahvins are very intelligent, do you? Yeah, but it's the metal, I mean, Doctor, you know. Well, it's inferior! Yes, well, it's tough, but, er, it's not impregnable. No, it's very common metal really. Yes, it's, er, nothing unusual, nothing unusual. Well, I suggest that we go in instead of standing around here admiring the scenery. Come along. Well, what are you talking about Doctor?! It's you who stopped to fiddle around on... But, you brought up the subject! Now don't argue, please! Don't argue! I've never heard such rubbish! Huh! Your friends. Safe, you see? No thanks to you, though, is it? All right Doctor? Yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, Doctor, you're all right! Yes, my child, I'm all right. You were away so long! Yes. Well, we'd have been a lot quicker if it hadn't been for the Doc... We got held up by a Chumbley. It tried to blow us up inside the TARDIS. It didn't succeed? Well of course they didn't! My ship's not made of tin like this old trash! Good gracious me! Seems if I cough too loud, maybe the whole thing would fall to pieces! It served its purpose. Yes, whatever that might be, hmm. Is that necessary? We have to protect ourselves against the machines. Did you find out about this planet? Yes. Will it explode? I'm afraid so. When? Exactly when the Rills said it would in fourteen dawns time. Fourteen dawns. Well, we should go, shouldn't we? We should... Doctor... Will you help us? Er, to do what, exactly? To capture the Rill spaceship so that we can escape? And how do I do that, hmm? What happens then, hmm? What do you mean? Well, I mean, er, what happens to the Rills, hmm? Well, they remain on this planet! To be blown up? They are murderers! Why couldn't you take them up with you? Because they're evil! You only have to see them to know. Evil! We only have your word for that. In any case, I can't help you. Why not? In the first place, madam, I never kill anything! Neither do my friends. Well, either the Rills die or we do! Or, as the young man suggests, why don't you both go off together, mm? Impossible! Come on, what's so impossible about it? Have you ever tried being friendly? Yes, a very good question, dear boy. It seems to me you want to be enemies. The situation was forced upon us. Or maybe they killed your soldier by mistake. There's no mistake about it! Well, you seem pretty sure for someone who was half unconscious after the crash! You, too, doubt my word. We'd be pretty stupid not to. Yes, all these objections sum up mine. It's none of our business. It's impossible. I'm afraid we can't help you. And it does appear to me that, ah, none of you have tried to help yourselves. Too busy fighting... You will not change your mind? No. This is your last chance. Very likely! You may not realize it, but at first I point this at your hand and then I pull the trigger and... Steven! A very good attempt, my boy. Never mind. You'll help us now? Yes, er, I don't seem to have much chance. You have none whatsoever! The Rills are repairing their spaceship. They have fourteen dawns in which to complete it. It is fourteen, isn't it? Oh, er, yes, quite. You sure? Yes, quite sure! Suddenly, I don't believe you! Oh, but, ah, why should I lie, hmm? I really don't know, but to trick us or something. When is this planet due to explode? Fourteen dawns time! Very well. We shall kill the girl! Two dawns. As soon as that? Well, you'll have to work quickly. The Rill spaceship is that way. You will capture it for us! It may not be ready yet. If it were, they'd have taken off by now. I'm sure that the Doctor can cope with that. Oh, you have great faith in me, haven't you, mm? Yes, I have... ...because I shall keep one of you here. I shall keep the girl! Oh no, you won't. You'll keep me! I said I shall keep... Do you want our help or don't you? You will do as the young man suggests, hmm?! Very well, we'll keep him. Come along Vicki - we have very little time. Madam, do I begin by walking through this, hmm? Do you honestly believe that they can capture the Rills' spaceship all by themselves? Either they succeed... or we all die together. Oh Doctor, come on, what are you standing there fo- Oh, I was just ruminating about the night and day. I was wondering when it was going to get dark, then I just realized That there's three suns on this planet. Hmm, hmm. What, you don't think they have night here at all? Oh yes, they must, my dear, they must, otherwise this ah, Maaga woman wouldn't be talking about dawns. Probably lasts about two hours, mm. Two hours? You remember when we were captured by those, er, Chumblies, hmm? Yes, I do! That ray gun - why did they use it on the ship? I mean, if the Rills are such enemies of the Drahvins Why don't they just wipe them out, hmm? Maybe their rays can't cut through metal or... Oh, don't you believe that, my dear. Don't you believe that for one minute! Heh, heh! No! That ray gun could go through this like a piece of paper. Oh, they don't even seem to have tried. Hmmm? No, it's all very odd, isn't it? *chuckle* Yes, it's very odd. Come on, Doctor, you said we haven't much time. Oh, yes, of course, nearly one dawn, yes. We must start that journey. Are you nervous? Well, they..... sounded a bit nasty, didn't they? Hmm, huh! Yes, well, it still won't work, but at least it looks prettier now. Can I have some food? Is this all there is? That is our food. Ugh. Does Maaga eat this? No. She is our leader. Well...Then I'll have some of what she eats. You cannot. It is food for our leaders only. Well, that hardly seems fair, does it? Fair? Yeah, I mean that, you know, she should have special food, and you have to eat this? It is food. Does... er, does Maaga have other special things? She is our leader and has leader's things. What leader's things? Her gun? Her food. Her gun? A leader's gun can destroy anything. What, even the Chumblies? Even the machines! Well, then, you know, surely it would be better if... er, if you all had these guns. Well then you wouldn't have to fear the machines. There is only one gun. Maaga has that gun as she is leader. You could take it with you when you went on patrol. Yes. Doesn't it seem right that you should? Only if Maaga says so! Yes, but I mean if you took it, and you... you went out and you destroyed the machine Maaga would be pleased. Maaga would be pleased if you destroyed the machine. Yes! Well, then you should take it. Yes... Well, I'll tell you what. You give me your gun, whilst you go and fetch Maaga's and then we can both fight the machines together. Yes... You're trying to be too clever! You have done badly. You will be punished. This is a prisoner. You must not talk to him! He was talking! He was trying to trick you like the machines. I... have done wrong. I did not understand. Go to your quarters. You must keep out of our way. I don't particularly want to be here at all. You don't have to be. Oh? You could easily escape from this planet. *chuckle* Oh, could I? In your own ship. Oh, taking you with me, of course. Well, you wouldn't expect us to stay behind? No, I suppose not. All you have to do is to take us off this planet and you are free! Just like that? It's a fair offer. Oh yes. Yes. But, even assuming I believed you that on the way you didn't decide that I was eating too much food There is a snag. What's that? I can't operate it. I couldn't if I tried. Only the Doctor could do that. It's his ship. Why don't you try making an offer to him? Or is it that you think he might be just a little bit too clever for you. I'm the gullible one, is that it? I'm not much help, am I? I could make you help us. No, you couldn't. I mean, even I can't do the impossible. So sorry. Get over there and stay there! That's an order, is it? Yes, it is. Maaga! What is it? Why do we not kill him now? I will let you kill him when I am good and ready. Doctor, we'll never get past those sentries. Fascinating things to watch, eh? I wonder what the principal of the operation is? I suppose it's quite simple once you know, hmm? Doctor! How are we going to get past them? Ah, yes, yes, that's quite a problem, my child, isn't it, hmm? You're telling me it is! Well, now don't lose patience, you see! Now look, in this case, first we must observe, note, collate, and then conclude. After that, perhaps we can act, hmm! Yeah. Well, with the time we've got you'll have to do all that in about ten minutes flat! Shh, shh, shh! Quiet, quiet! What the... what the... what do... what are you doing? That's the answer, Doctor, I thought that if I... My dear child! You'll get us killed! Didn't you see? They only pick up sounds in front of them. If we keep immediately behind them, we... they won't know we're there. Yes, yes yes, you may appear to be right, but it's dangerous... it's very risky! That was no risk. I noted observed collated concluded... and then I threw the rock! Oh yes, yes, yes, quite so, yes, yes. You about finished? Now, this time I'll ta... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt! But, well now... now, I suppose we've got to make a run for it! Ahh! Are you sure you can manage? Oh, I think I can drag my aged limbs... limbs in some sort of resemblance of a run! Go on! Power units! Off. Guns. Down. Power units. Readings. One? Three-nine-seven! Two? Three-nine-four! Three? Three-eight-six... Get it charged, Three. All guns must be perfect. If anyone is found defective... ...the owner will be severely punished! Because soon, now, we will use them. I, Maaga, will see to it. Soon, now, we will break into the Rills' spaceship. And the Rills, they will all be wiped out! So far, so good! That looks like the home of the Rills. That must be their space ship over there. Yes, and what's... what's that other thing? It looks like a... a drill rig. Yes, it does, doesn't it? What could they be drilling for, hmm? Oil? Gas? Yeah. Well, there's only one way to find out. Go on! What on earth will we do if another one of those things comes out? We'd be in trouble! Do you know, this is a nice piece of building! Hmm. It looks very temporary to me. It's most impressive! Yes! Heh, heh. Most impressive! What's this, I wonder? Huh? You know, I think these Rills are far more advanced than I thought they were, hmm? Yes, it looks like some kind of... air purifier. Yes, or some kind of machinery for... converting air into something else. Yes, it's most interesting. Can you see anything? No. I'll lead the way. You know, this looks as though it's been built for the Chumblies. A Chumbley-shaped corridor! Doctor? Hmm? If this one is for the Rills...? Hmm. Hmm! Can you smell anything? Very faint though, isn't it. Hmm. What is it? don't know, but I... I feel as though I ought to. Yes, so should I, mm. Come on! Hmm. Well, I must say, it's a... astonishing shape and design Hmm, hmm. Marvellous work! Marvellous! That smell is getting stronger, you know. Its what? Oh, Doctor! I thought they'd heard us. What are they doing? Listening or smelling? A spaceship! And you can't scratch the metal! Hmm, hmm Isn't that astounding? Yes, it's far superior, far superior! Wonderful stuff for a spaceship. Hmm, hmm. Doctor? Hmm? I know what that smell is now. Ammonia. Doctor? What do you think this thing is here? Well, I should say this is, ah, some sort of repair shop, hmm. Yes, and that's a... what, a Chumbley attachment? Yeah. Yes, a revelation, a revelation! Hmm! Ah. Do you think it's a baby one? Not awake just yet. Well, hmm, hmm. Ah...
