(static buzzes) (crowd murmurs) - [Man] You wanna tell us real quick where we are? - We took a train a few stops into Toulouse proper and then just walked right down the street and ended up in this square, and it's clearly a memorial for the attack in Paris. (crowd applauds) Somebody just appeared out there. I'm not sure who it is though. I'm on the side of the people, so I'll clap for them. - Anti-Flag is one of the hardest working bands in show business. Every time I contact those guys, they're always on tour, for 20 years they've been on tour. I saw them play at the Key Club in Los Angeles at some benefit show and I was just blown away by the unapologetic political ferocity of the show. - My friends, in three simple words sing fuck police brutality! (upbeat punk music) - Not a huge amount of American bands that have such a strong political content in their music. And so that's always drawn me to them. - I grew up on punk music, and there was a lot of social commentary and political commentary in a lot of those songs by other bands, but they were like, that was the forefront of their, you know, their existence. - I remember seeing the balcony, and I grew up in Chicago, so I've seen many shows at the Metro, and watching the floor just erupt with just energy and enthusiasm and sing-alongs and thinking like, holy shit, this band is incredible.. - Kills fucking fascists. - It's kind of an interesting, an interesting melange of clash and discharge, raw and playing at the very edge of their ability, which I am a huge fan of. It could go tragically wrong at any moment. There's a tension that's there that a lot of my favorite music has that, and they definitely have it. - You've got a Pat who is both sort of personally really on the front lines of political activism, also is a great drummer and sort of the steam engine of the band, and then you have Chris number one, who is the strong, silent type, his waters run silent, but his waters run deep. And number two was of course the, you know, the fiery leapfrogging punk presence who, you know, is barking orders to the youth of the day about the solidarity that they must have at the show, we must take care of each other. And then Justin, who is the heart and soul of the band and wears his feelings on his sleeve and just is a great front man, those four things come together to make for really one of the great punk bands. - Oh yeah, whenever I look back on the history of the band, there are definite consistencies that stand out to me. I mean, whether there was a Republican or Democrat in the White House, or punk rock was in or out of fashion in the mainstream, or, you know, whether there were five or 5,000 kids at an Anti-Flag show, we still consistently made music and fought battles that were important to us. And to me, this feels like the only thing I've ever wanted to do with my life. And I'll probably die while I'm doing this, but I'm cool with that.

As we grew together and we realized that we were looking for other things in life and playing music was one of them. - I had a guitar and I had a drum set and I was like, "Hey dude, why don't you come over and play?" And we made like the worst music. I mean, he could hardly play the drums and I really couldn't play the guitar, so it was like, I wouldn't really call it music, - But I remember watching "Another State of Mind" and it's a movie that Social Distortion and Minor Threat were in and they got into an old school bus and drove around the country and played in shows. And I saw that at a very young age and I was like, that is what I want to do with my life. - The first expectations were that it would be fun to play in a band, and then Minor Threat formed and so I was playing in a band. And then after that, the idea was wouldn't it be amazing to make a record at some point? And then it was, wouldn't it be fun, it'd be amazing to go play other places. You know, the aspiration was like, well, if we've got to play New York and then that's it, we're Kiss, I mean, this is it. This is, you know, that was the, it was just amazing to even think that that could be possible, but still, it was, the reason why Minor Threat broke up the first time was the guitar player had to go to college. It's like, okay, well I have to go to school now. Yeah, I get it. I mean, we just, no idea that we'd be talking about this now, that it was important in any way. I mean, it was important to us and it was something that we enjoyed doing. - When I first started, I was just putzing around in my parents' back room with some kids from around the corner, so it was really just like most people, it was just a way of being social. It was, you know, a little gang, we're in a little band. - You know, people have asked me like, what, when did your political education begin? It began, I was the only black kid in an all white town to be out on the playground. When I first walked out there, I got to see sort of injustice firsthand. And I didn't really choose to be a guitar player, that chose me, and then once I was anointed with that blessing or that curse, it was, I always thought it was my responsibility to weave my convictions into my vocation. - My mother was born in Pittsburgh. My dad was born in Ireland. He immigrated to Pittsburgh, my parents met. My folks grew up devout Irish Catholics. That changed very rapidly in the 1970s. One of, I think one of the positive things about the Irish or the Catholic religion is liberation theology. And it's the idea that you should spend time with the poor and you should help the poor and you should fight for the poor. My mom decided that the Irish Catholic church was sexist and that it wasn't the place for her. She felt like it was really limiting to women and she didn't think any people should be limited in any way, and then this is like right in the midst of the Vietnam war, people are starting to figure out that the government is lying about the war. And so all of a sudden my parents took this big shift away from the Catholic church. And I, I'm kind of the end result of that. Hello father. - Hi guys. - So this is Martin and Teresa Geever. - Here we are. - And they're the reason that I'm here in this world, rabble rousing and causing all this trouble. - You never learned it from us. - No. (laughing) - My mom was the first person that my dad knew of that was opposed to the Vietnam war. It was hard to rebel in my family. - So a lot of Irish music is protest music. And I just grew up with that with my mom and dad. And I'm sure Ayman did too. And then there was always something going on in this country that you had to protest. I don't think I ever insisted that the kids go along with what we believe, I think we lived it and then they got a chance to decide. - My dad would keep all his tools and whatnot down here, you can see it's total disaster. And then you come up these steps. We'd have to load our gear up and down this stairwell, which was always a nightmare. And this is what it is today. It's kind of a, my dad paints and my sister paints. You could see the ceiling's really low. You know, you kind of, we had to set the drums up here because it was the only space that was open enough for the drums to be able to fit. It's not much to behold these days. It is what it is. It was good to us though. - Everybody else wanted to go to college and to start the next phase of your lives, and I was like, fuck you, I'm gonna go, and I couldn't join the Peace Corps 'cause I wasn't, didn't have a degree. I couldn't do a lot of other things. Obviously didn't want to join the military. So to get out of Pittsburgh, I found a camp for mentally handicapped people in Iowa and I was like, I got on a Greyhound bus and left. Right before Justin realized that he was gonna come back to Pittsburgh, he called me up and said, "okay, here's the deal." He said, "this kid, Andy, he's really good bass player. Me, you, and Andy we'll get the band and we'll really make a go playing in the band." - Ninth grade rolls around, eighth, probably eighth grade and my mom was like, "Hey, I'm gonna this church and I want you to come with me." And I was like, "are you out of your fucking mind?" She's like, "you know, someday you might move away, and when you do like, you know, you might be down or you know, you're gonna be looking for people. I just want to be sure that you don't fall in with a cult." So she's like, "look, there's this church, they're called the Unitarian Universalists, they're really open minded, you don't even have to believe in God to go there." And that's where I met Andy. So Andy and I met as a result of my mom making me go to church. - And I was like, okay, that's great. And then when Justin came home from San Francisco, we started working on Anti-Flag with Andy, me and Justin. - I wanted to name the band Anti-Flag because every time corrupt politicians want to start a war, they pull out the flag, and with the flag, they bring this corrupted patriotism. And time and again, what we see is that these wars benefit no one but this corrupt group of politicians and the wealthy people that they represent. - We played a lot of shows in the Pittsburgh area. We would put on our own shows because again, there wasn't the infrastructure of clubs and promoters because nobody cared about punk rock. We decided that we would rent musical gear and we set up the recording equipment ourselves and recorded "Die For the Government" and "System." ♪ You're gonna die, gonna die ♪ ♪ Gonna die for your government ♪ ♪ Die for your country that's shit ♪ ♪ You're gonna die, gonna die ♪ ♪ Gonna die for your government ♪ ♪ Die for your country that's shit ♪ (upbeat punk music) - When we recorded "Die For the Government," I don't know what we thought we were gonna do with it. I have no idea, a friend of ours, the old man who had the old man radio hour in Erie, he had some contact with New Red Archives and Nicky Garratt, who was in the UK Subs. - With "Die For the Government," I was excited because the UK Subs was one of my favorite bands. - And I remember Nicky Garratt calling us and saying, "Hey, I heard your record and I'd like to put it out." And that was, yeah, it was an amazing moment for us. 'Cause we didn't, it didn't make any sense to us that he would call. - The record was actually gonna have distribution, which was incredible. It was gonna be distribution outside of like the little DIY distros, which to me was important because we had this message that, you know, this overall philosophy that we were trying to put out into the mainstream, I was like, wow, you know, like for the first time I was like, wow, we could take this out of the punk basement and possibly impact other people with it, other kids who might be thinking about joining the army, maybe they'll hear this record and they won't join the army Andy left the band. - [Pat] He and Justin didn't get along. They both had very strong personalities. - Andy was a great guy. If Andy and I hadn't been in a band together, we would have been awesome friends, but being in a band together, we were just both so strong-headed about how things should be that we just butt heads, you know? - And that made my whole world collapse. We don't have a band anymore and this thing that I love so much is gonna go away. And Justin and I were like, you know what? Fuck Andy, we're gonna continue this no matter what. - Then we had a bunch of fill in bass players, people who were not gonna be in a band, but that would fill in for a tour or a couple of shows. - What happened is we went back to 1988 with Justin and I. We're like, "who wants to play bass?" Anybody we know who can play bass, come and be in our band. And then we found Cock who was Canadian. - Her name was actually Jamie, but her nickname was Cock. - And she was the perfect person to join our band because she's like, "I'm on welfare in Canada. I just have to go home every couple months to prove to the welfare agency that I'm looking for a job, even though I'm not. And then they pay me money and I can do whatever I want." And we're like, "you're the perfect one to be in our band." - But before Jamie, actually we, Chris Head played bass. We knew we had to get somebody permanent. Our friend Sean Wayland said, "Hey, you should get this kid Chris Head, he's as insane as you guys, all he wants to do is play in a band." - The things that I was doing were not really very gratifying. It's kind of the singer of the band was a drunk kind of, and the other guys in the band really didn't want to be playing in the band and just were doing it just for something to do, and I was kind of like hoping to find something more. - [Justin] So Pat and I agreed. We were like, we should ask them to be in the band, but we don't want him to play bass, he's not good enough and we could see that. He just didn't have the right feel for bass, but I knew he could play guitar, and he was a good guitar player. So I was like, look, let's add a second guitar. - I was like, yeah, this is great. I'm in the band, you know? Awesome. I'm gonna be doing music again, I'm super stoked. (machine grinds) I've always been into like arts and crafts and things like that. I grew up, before I joined the band that was doing pottery and a lot of drawing in high school. I was actually gonna go and become a ceramicist before I joined Anti-Flag, and that's, you know, I guess, yeah. I was actually gonna go away to ceramic school and get a master's of the arts. Yeah, I'm sure people don't, wouldn't expect someone in Anti-Flag to be sitting here making little green plant arrangements. (dramatic music) - [Man] What was the outcome, dude? - The outcome? We lost, it was terrible. You know, the first cassette tape I ever got was MC Hammer, "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em," ya know, and it was awesome when I played it all the time and I loved it. And then my brother, he was like 16 and 17 and he was always on the other side of the law. I would meet cops and they'd be like, oh, you're, you know, Mike's little brother. Yeah, we're gonna get them. You know, they would say shit like that to me, like 10 years old, you know? And so very early on, I knew I hated cops, even though I didn't know why I hated cops, you know? My brother would always work on his cars in the garage at the house. I heard this music coming from his car and it was a song called "Fuck the Police" by NWA. And I was like, fuck MC Hammer, this is what I listen to now. That's all I listened to as a kid, and I would be popular with my little friends because I had tapes that said the F word, you know? But like, for me, it like really struck a chord with me because like these people were talking about being fucked with, by cops all the time, and like, that was something that I could identify with because my brother was going through it. That's kind of like the gateway drug to it all, that you talk about and that I hope Anti-Flag to be, is that you can get a record in a record store, but then you look at the back of it and you listen to it and you're like, what inspired this? Little did I know that that was happening in Pittsburgh with Aus-Rotten and Bad Genes and Anti-Flag and these bands. And I would go and see them when they played in town. And actually like my first punk rock show was an Anti-Flag show at Charlie's. - We would always be playing Pittsburgh. Our first shows like as a band, we would always go out and it was like this running joke, it came to a point where everyone, we would get there and the guy who owned the house was like yeah, you know, I think Justin Sane might come out to the show. We're like "whoa, no way." - It was the first time that I've realized that someone from our town could make songs that people would care about and listen to. - [Justin] He was like this naggy little brother, you know, that was like, "dude, can I come to the show with you? Hey, can I hang out with you? What are you doing? Why are you doing that? What do you like, why do you like that? Who's your favorite band?" You know, like, and it was usually wasted. Like he'd just be drunk and falling all over himself. - I just, I probably drank a bunch of box wine and was like, "good show, dude, play this fucking song." You know, who knows? - When we were kids, like that was part of like, being in the punk scene was like drinking 40s and smashing them on the wall and then walking into like the VFW hall or whatever, and you know, being at a show. - We started writing "New Kind of Army" and Cock was becoming more and more of a burden through this process, and we couldn't just play. Like if somebody called us and said, "Hey, you want to play a show next week in Pittsburgh?" We couldn't because we had to go drive up to Canada, get her, bring her back across the border. We're never sure whether we're gonna be able to get her back into the country, and so it became more and more problematic. - When it became apparent that that Jamie wasn't gonna be our bass player anymore, I knew we had to find somebody and I just wanted to find somebody who's dedicated to just going out and doing it as much as we were. - Basically what had happened was I was better friends with Jamie than I was really anyone else in the band and got a letter one day from her that she was back in Canada and that she was no longer in the band. While I was reading that letter, my phone rang, and this is my mom's phone, I was 16 years old or something like that. - Called him up and I was like, "Hey man, you know, we're needing a bass player and can you play bass? You know?" And he's like, "yeah, yeah, yeah. I can play bass." So I was like, "well, why don't you come over and we'll sit down and we'll see how you do." - He was smart enough to know to not bring me to like a practice with everybody. - So he came over and we went upstairs in the shack and we sat down and I was like, "okay, you know, here's one of our songs and here's how it goes." - And I practiced and he was like, "you don't know how to play bass," because I played guitar and I thought it was the same thing. And it's not. - [Justin] I mean, he couldn't play like four notes. He was terrible. Like, it was amazing how bad he was. - He politely told me I didn't know how to play bass, and then not only did that, he kind of took it one step further and we went through a bunch of things and he, you know, all the way down to how to hold a fucking guitar pick. - So we've met a few more times each time he just got like noticeably better. And within a couple of weeks, like I was like, I'll tell you what, man, why don't you come over and you and Pat and Chris, and I want you all play together. - I didn't know anything about it, him, and subsequently I know that he and Justin were formulating plans behind my back. And so I wasn't real happy about this, and obviously Justin was aware of this, my frustration with the plan, but he said, "well, let them come into the practice room and we'll see what he can do." He came in and he said, "hi, my name is Chris." And I said, "we already have a Chris in the band." And I said, "you'll be number two." And that is really shitty thing to say, but then that name stuck and he's been number two since then. - So it was funny, Two leaves and Pat are talking about it and Pat's like, "yeah, there's like some potential there. This might work, but I don't know, we'll see." And Head was like, "I don't want him. He's no good. He's annoying." - And I remember seeing Two at shows and just thinking this dude's, you want this fucking crazy dude in the band? He's like 16 years old and he's just seems like a nutjob. - Like Head fuckin' was so, had no interest whatsoever. Like he didn't like him, he wasn't good at bass. It was just like, Head was like, "fuck this kid." For me though, it was like, that marks the current lineup that we had ever since. And that's really where the history of Anti-Flag truly starts. (punk music) ♪ Drink drank punk ♪ ♪ Drink drank punk ♪ ♪ Drink drank punk ♪ The words are "drink drank punk." On the count of one, two, three, for the love of god, don't fuck up. One, two, three! - [Crowd] Drink drank punk! - We'll see you when we fuckin' see ya, good night and good luck! Peace. (upbeat guitar riff) - We always wanted to be on Fat because Fat was the record company that was doing stuff. Even though I felt as a West coast punk rock was sold out punk rock and East coast punk rock was true punk rock. - Especially in Pittsburgh, all the bands were political. And if you weren't political, you were kind of a poser band. - East coast punk was about squatters and revolution. - I think that there is a certain thing about east of Ohio. You need snow to really get it, that the leather jacket makes more sense. - It was really interesting for us to like have an opportunity to go out and tour with these bands, and then realize like, oh yeah, you know what? These guys actually are just like us. Like, they're really cool. And they came out of the exact same scene that we came out of. I met Fat Mike at a Bouncing Souls show. Pete from the Souls introduced me to Mike and I gave him a copy of "Die For the Government," and Mike was really cool, he was like, Oh yeah, man. So it's cool, and he called me like the next day or the day after and he's like, "Hey, Justin, like, yeah, like, yeah, it's Fat Mike. why don't we do something together?" And I was just like, "fuck yeah," like I was so stoked. - So I think we sent them a copy of "New Kind of Army" that we created, and Fat Mike said to us, "it's not good enough to be on Fat proper." - He just totally pulled the rug out from underneath me and he's like, but I don't want to put it out on Fat. - And he said, "but I'm starting this other record label called Honest Don's." - Honest Don's put out a sampler and Mike was like, "look, I'm gonna put you on the sampler and you know, see how you guys like it, it'll be good for Anti-Flag. People get to know the name. Sampler's gonna be everywhere." I open it up, right, and like take out of a box like this. And it's like, okay, got the CD and it's a picture of this like clown and he's kneeling over a giant bowl of cereal that looks like Cocoa Puffs or something like that, and he's taking a shit in the bowl of cereal, it's called "Honest Don's Greatest Shits." We all just looked at each other and we're like, "we can't be on this fucking label. There's no way." So I make the call to Fat Mike. And I remember it was like Pat sitting here and I'm on the phone with him here. And we're like really nervous, you know, because I'm gonna try to talk them into putting us on Fat. And I'm like, "yeah, man, I got that sampler." I'm like, "dude, that is not us." And he's like, he's like, "well," he offered an extra five grand 'cause he really wanted to put out our record. And I was just like, "dude, I can't do it." And he was like, "well, I'm not, I can't put it on Fat." I was like, "all right, well we're not gonna do it." And he went, "what?" (laughs) That, it was amazing, he was like, genuinely, I think he was like, I blew his mind that we weren't gonna do it. He was like, "that was a mistake." He was like, "I should've put you guys on Fat." That record sold 100,000 records really fast, and it's sold 100,000 records faster than the record we put out in Fat, the next record. So, ultimately it was kind of funny. He was like, "yeah, I fucked up on that one." - It felt almost like a contest you won. It's like, oh, we're gonna do a record on this cool label, we're gonna tour the world once, and then we're gonna go back to school and get real jobs. You know, it was kind of, that's what it would've felt like. Every time I hit a city, I was like, I'm never going back here, I should take a lot of pictures, you know. - In 1999, Rage Against the Machine, were going on tour, and each member of Rage got to pick one band to play, open up a quarter of the tour. My choice was Anti-Flag, that's the good news. The bad news is there was no way to contact the band. The only contact information was a PO box, I believe somewhere in Pittsburgh. So I wrote letters to that PO box saying, "this is Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine. We would like to take you on tour. Please respond." - And I had just seen the "Guerrilla Radio" video. I'm watching like this band's, this is who we should be playing with. Like, this is a band that's huge and they're saying the same things we're saying. Dude, they're awesome. We need to play with that band. I'm gonna call Greg at Go-Kart and see if we can get, see if he knows anybody who knows anybody who knows anybody who can get us in touch with Rage Against the Machine, and that same day or in the same like 48 hours, Tom Morello called Go-Kart 'cause he had bought "A New Kind of Army" and he was like, "I want to play shows with these guys." And so I finally got ahold of Greg at Go-Kart, and he was like, I was like, "hey, did you get my message about Tom?" and he was like, "yeah, did he call you too?" And I was like, "no, I called you seeing if you had any contacts for them." And he was like, "wait, what? Like they just called us." And so like, it just, it was crazy. - The Rage Against the Machine tour came around and we were super stoked to do it. And it was my favorite band at the time. And it was gonna be massive arenas on the east coast. One of the being a show that was protested by the entire police force of Philadelphia. - I remember being in the hotel before the show, watching the news and the chief of police was on the news telling parents not to let their kids go to the show because Rage Against the Machine supported Mumia Abu-Jamal and the police were protesting the show. So when we arrived, the entire arena was surrounded by cop cars, with all of their lights going off in protest to the show. I already, I was just like "this band's doing it." Like all the shit we talk about, like this band's doing it. - Getting to that arena and seeing the line circled around with the police with all their lights on. - No one was deterred by the chief of police. The show was very successful. In fact, they like opened up more tickets than they've ever sold at that place. And so I remember tuning my guitar and turning around and they had sold the seats behind the stage, like the back corner. And so there was more people like behind my amp than I've ever played to before my life. Rage came out, and you know, de la Rocha said something like. - Well let's make it clear. - We don't support any killers. - Especially not killer cops. - And then they played "Guerrilla Radio," and then I was like, "this is what I was talking about." - Let me tell you, it's not easy to open for Rage Against the Machine. At the Drive-In opened a quarter of that tour and were booed off stage on a nightly basis. - And At the Drive-In had the toughest go of it, like to the point where de la Rocha would have to go on and introduce them every night. You know, you always hear like this story about, you know, The Offspring opening up for somebody, getting booed off the stage and rocks thrown at them. And now they go on to mega stardom. And so I often wonder, hey, maybe it would have gone, maybe our trajectory would have been a lot higher had we gotten rocks thrown at us while playing with Rage Against the Machine. - Unfortunately, we did really well on that tour. We were recording in Pittsburgh, the record "Mobilize." - And I woke up in the morning and I was gonna be headed to the studio. There's a morning radio show that I like to listen to, and I remember the day, it was a news program and they were talking about that a small plane had run into the World Trade Center, but they thought it was an accident, and they thought it was a small plane, and the details were pretty iffy. I left, I ate breakfast, I left the house, I got into the car and just as I turned the car on, the radio came on and I heard the radio announcer saying, "Oh my God, Oh my God." And I knew something really bad had happened. So turn the car off, went back in the house. I turned on the TV and that was uh, they showed the second plane hit. And then that's when I knew this wasn't gonna be a regular day. I knew something was, was really bad. (tense music) - We called each other and we said we're not coming in today. - Everybody's too freaked out. You know, what do we, we didn't feel like we were going to be able to work in a productive way. - For me personally, I had, my dad apparently was in New York city getting ready to have a meeting in the World Trade Center, and I didn't even know he was up there, and I'm sitting there watching all this on the news, you know, probably about 2:30, 3:00 rolls around. My mom calls me and she's like, "yeah, your father's okay." When the planes hit, they were right down below, and then they finally got out of the city and I had to actually drive up to New York to pick my dad up. - And then it was almost pretty immediate, like it was in the next eight hours of that which it became known as a terrorist attack and nationalism ran rampant and people were waving American flags and calling for blood. And, and we were in a band called Anti-Flag. (somber music) Yeah, there were a few conversations as to what we should do. And then the next couple of weeks, while being in the studio and working on those songs, it became a discussion about whether or not we're still a band. - Basically. We thought the band was gonna be, you know, no more because people are gonna not want to hear what we had to say anymore. People were, you know, our records got pulled places, our t-shirts all got pulled. - Hot Topic, which was the one stop shop for all your alternative needs at the time, they sent back all of our merch and they pulled it from the shelves. Our records came down everywhere. - And that was, that was everywhere. You know, you're getting records all over the place. People sending our shit back to us, you know, saying that they didn't believe in what we had to say anymore. And no, even like my parents I think questioned, you know, what we were doing at the time. - We knew the response was gonna be violence to violence, and we knew that there had to be an opposing voice to that. - And then we wrote "911 for Peace" and decided that it was more important than ever for us to be Anti-Flag. ♪ I don't wanna die ♪ ♪ I don't wanna kill ♪ ♪ I don't wanna kill ♪ ♪ I don't wanna die ♪ ♪ We all are human ♪ ♪ Let's start to prove it ♪ - We put the song up for free, and I remember it had like 100,000 downloads in the first day and people were kinda like, we broke our servers. Yeah, that was certainly a moment where we, we recognized that we weren't alone. - That was the tour where were we said to ourselves "all right, it's been long enough." Now we have to critically assess what our government and what our representatives are doing. And we need to be free to express how we feel about the direction they're taking us in. - Constantly running into skinheads, constantly running into people. It was on the Mobilized tour where in Florida people came to the show, they wanted to kill us. - I mean, you would be shocked. You'd be surprised. It's almost hard to believe, but it's, to me it's understandable why that happened. People were in shock. People were scared and mourning. So I understand why people fell animosity towards us. They were looking for justice or revenge or whatever you want to call it, and we were one of the first groups to come out and say that going to war over 9/11 is wrong. Not a lot of people wanted to hear that message at that very moment. ♪ Sing power to the peaceful ♪ ♪ Power, power to the peaceful ♪ ♪ Power to the peaceful, whoa ♪ ♪ It's power to the peaceful ♪ - Large groups of pro-Russia troops surrounding Ukrainian bases, ordering their forces off of them so they can occupy them. The international warning to Russia to end its invasion is being ignored. - I got a 5,000 rupee dollar bill. - [Chris] If I go in the water? - If you take up all your clothes and run in there. (laughing) - 5,000. - We went to Russia for three or four shows. - It's funny how like you go to places and you play in a band for a really, really fucking long time, and no one really bats an eyelash, you know. Like most of the time it's like, oh, you're cool. Like, wait, you get to go to Europe, that's amazing. Like good for you, you know? And this was one of the first times where folks came out of the woodwork and were like, "don't go." - According to people around us, we shouldn't have gone because we're very close to a war with Russia. - And I thought that was really interesting. Like Steve, our drum tech, I remember like his Facebook page whenever he was like, "I'm gonna Russia," like people like, you know, he's like a younger kid, so like, I'm sure it was yinzer moms and things of the ilk came out and they were like, "be careful, please, Stevie, come back alive," you know, and all of this like crazy shit. And I was thinking to myself like that never happens. It's always like "good for you!" You know? And so the have the dynamic of, to have the dynamic of that change, and see it had changed was really interesting. And then we landed in Russia and we spent the first four days in St. Petersburg. We had our best experience ever in Russia on this trip. - You know, they call St. Petersburg the Pittsburgh of Russia. They don't, but I do. One thing that was really striking to me was when we landed, they took a picture of us because they were like, people are canceling shows. So this we'll put this picture on Instagram and people will know you're actually in Russia. - My experience in Russia was absolutely incredible. It really gave me a great sense of how well propaganda works. You talk to people face to face, and once you get beyond whose side is right when it comes down to politics, you realize that there's a ton of people out there just trying to make the world better on a day to day basis for the people around them. And that the majority of people don't want to have anything to do with their leader's bullshit. - This is a train full of our gear, which means there's no room for us 'cause there's only gear. - [Chris] Where are we going? - Uh (stammers) Moscow. - This is the a fucking glamorous life, bro. - But then the shows, they were really great. They were all successful and packed shows and people, I feel as if it was like a sigh of relief, like, you know, like people in Russia want folks to know that not everyone is homophobic, not everyone is racist or sexist or, you know, pro or against Ukrainian. I think for them to have an opportunity to have like a night of solace, like that's eventually what the shows became. They weren't political statements one way or another, as much as they were just a place to go and be free for an hour, and then everybody wanted to hug. Like it was crazy, man. Like there was no such thing as personal space. Like everyone was just like getting you in that. And this, this tends to be a trend, but the scenarios that we kind of get the most freaked out about end up working out really well, and the ones that were like this is a sure bet, that ends up being a goddamn clusterfuck. So there's no, there's obviously no rhyme or reason to any of this stuff. - Russia is trying to take over the Ukraine. The Ukrainians are trying to keep the Russians out, or at least some of them are, and since we left Russia, there was a Malaysian flight that got shot down. - Based on reports from Reuters and Interfacts, a Malaysian airlines flight with about 295 people on board has crashed, we are told from reports in Reuters and Interfacts, this happened in Ukraine near the Russian border. - The plane gets shot down. It's a fucking tragedy. And we don't know what to do about, we feel helpless. I mean much like everybody else does. - I thought, yeah, this is what happens when, when people use power and violence to get their way. - So that all being said, we get the news that the plane has been shot down. We internally sit, the four of us with Jesse, and I think it was Justin, he's like, "well, it's cool, man, we're on a bus." And Jesse's like, "actually, that's the one show you fly into." (laughs) And we're like, "awesome." So we're afraid, but we're gonna do it. We're not gonna let fear dictate anything. - I'm not worried about it at all, but I'm probably naive. I think that horrible things happen all the time to everybody all over the world, and it's either gonna happen to you or it's not, and you can't really do anything. And if you live in fear of bad things happening to you, you never get anything done. So I'm a believer of just stay on task, get the job done. And if something bad happens to you, your relatives will make a lot of money 'cause you'll sell a lot of records after you're dead. (tense music) (engine hums) - If someone falls down, we pick them up. If someone falls down, we pick them up. You got it? (crowd cheers) Everyone else, hands up like this, hands up like this, hands up like this. (audience clapping) That's the shit! That's the shit. That's fucking massive. (upbeat punk music) - He realizes that the people on the ground, they don't, it has nothing to do with them. It's all about the power and people trying to show that they control this region or they control that region, but a friend of mine said, "how does it feel to be in a country that's been at war for the last 10 years?" And I'm like, "well, the day to day life, we don't feel it." We were in a war with Afghanistan. We were in the war in Iraq for years. And the day to day, our life, we don't feel it. Much like the people in Russia, the day to day life, they're not feeling like they're invading the Ukraine right now. They feel like they're just going about their business. (upbeat music) - "Rock Against Bush" was Fat Mike's baby, and his argument, and I think it was a very sound one was that he played a show and there were maybe 5,000 people at the show in Florida, and had he had said something about the election, maybe some of those people would have voted not for George W. Bush and possibly for Al Gore. And that would have changed the outcome in Florida. Mike said, "let's put together this tour, and what we'll do is we'll go into the states that the election is close and try and make young people impassioned about this electoral process." - [Announcer] Gentleman is recognized for one minute. - Mr. Speaker, I want to introduce you to four young men. Justin Sane, Chris Two, Chris Head, and Pat Thetic. They are a major punk band called Anti-Flag. They're straight edge punk, no drugs, no alcohol, just kids from Pittsburgh with interesting colored hairdos and a great message for young people, register and vote or be told what to do and where to go and fight by an administration that will not talk straight to the American people. - On this tour, we'd get up in the morning, we'd go to protests, we'd go to rallies and talk to people about who are doing political work and electoral work and things like that. - If you want to make change, you're gonna get out and vote. And that's why what punk rock is doing, punk folk is doing is in my view, stirring up and making people think about the opportunity they have to actually make a change. Lots of punk rock is about apathy and anger, and it's the apathy I want to get rid of and get the anger going. - We had speakers every night, we had student organizations and student movements coming out. - Please welcome Anti-Flag. (audience applauds) - History is not shaped by presidents or popes. History is not shaped by congressmen or kings. History is certainly not shaped by Fox News. History is shaped by the people. It is shaped by us. - In order for a band to be great, or for an artist to be great, they have to be true to themselves, and I was attempting to, I was trying to make Audioslave a more political band than Rage Against the Machine. And then I woke up one day and thought, well, I'm the only guy in the band that wants to do that. So this is not gonna be an authentic endeavor unless it's real, and it took a less political direction, but I needed an outlet for my worldview in music. I had been only playing folk music for maybe two or three years at the time. And standing out there with an acoustic guitar alone in front of a punk, teenage punk rock audience, waiting to go ape shit for Anti-Flag to come on stage was a great artistic learning experience for me. You know, this is an audience that didn't know one of my, I didn't have a record out, I didn't have a solo record. I was playing no material that anyone was gonna know in a style of music that perhaps they were unfamiliar with, and perhaps they were even hostile to, and going out there every day and trying to win over that crowd was something that was really artistically fulfilling for me and was an exciting part of the tour. - Unfortunately, it did not work, and it was very frustrating when it didn't work, but that's how it goes. ♪ As I was walking a ribbon of highways ♪ So yeah, it was incredibly frustrating that Bush took the White House for a second term, but I would argue the punk voter was successful in that it helped activate a whole new group of young activists. ♪ This land was made for you and me ♪ ♪ This land is your land ♪ ♪ This land is my land ♪ ♪ From California to the New York island ♪ ♪ From the redwood forest ♪ ♪ To the Gulf stream waters ♪ ♪ This land was made for you and me ♪ ♪ Take it, Number Two ♪ ♪ I've walked and rambled ♪ ♪ I've followed my footsteps ♪ ♪ To the sparkling sands of the desert ♪ ♪ When all around me ♪ ♪ That voice was sounding ♪ ♪ Yeah, this land was made for you and me ♪ - [Justin] We left for the Rock Against Bush tour. - We flew out in the morning and it was raining in the morning, and we landed in Seattle and we got a phone call. The stream behind our offices was rising and it was flooding. Okay, but so was the water in the building parking lot yet or not? Okay, so it was up to the trailer. - Everything's flooded, the warehouse is flooded. You can't even, you can't get across town, Pittsburgh is totally flooded. - [Firefighter] Unbelievable. - [Reporter] Unbelievable is right. The nearby Family Dollar store deluge, muddy waters rushing through the streets, the current so powerful it carried away a huge dumpster. Water up to the bumpers of the few cars left parked on the street. - We invested everything we had into the label and it was working, and the record label was doing well and we had a list of about 20 bands who were all making records and releasing material. - Everything that was in there was trashed. Yeah, it was a mess. - The water was, you know, over waist high, almost chest high throughout the entire office. It's gonna to get there 'cause it's going rain all day tomorrow too. - Wow. - [Pat] We are screwed. - Well we can't think about it now. There's nothing we can do. Even if we got on a plane and got there, they wouldn't even land us in Pittsburgh. To be on that tour where we needed to have focus and to know things at home were such a mess, we just knew that losing a computer in the mud wasn't as dire of an issue as the discussions we were having at some of these Rock Against Bush shows where we were talking to young people, and those were really like dire moments in activism. They felt, they felt dire. They felt like, they felt life or death. Unfortunately, we were all right. And I remember coming home and it was, yeah, it was brutal, it was really depressing to come home. If you've ever been through a flood, everything just stinks and is waterlogged and full of bacteria and it's just a horrible existence. Our truck was ruined, our, yeah, everything that we had was ruined. It wiped out the local business that was next to us that was a builder supply company. It wiped them out completely. So to look at it and to say like our record label and our band survived it, and to see a company that had been existence for 30 years not be able to survive it, like, there's definitely something to say about us being able to keep it together. And for lack of a better term, keep it afloat. - It would have been very easy to pack up and say "let's be done," but we just kept moving little by little, and sooner or later we were out of it and we had good people who helped us out. - You start these bands and you know, you're not careerist about them at all. I know all those guys and I'm sure all of them never thought they'd be doing this for a living. You know, you start in a garage with your buds. You barely know how to play, you know, and you never foresaw yourself still playing music professionally. I remember reading my first record review and I was like, "Oh wait, now I'm the guy in the review." Like I used to be the guy reading the reviews, you know what I mean? Just kinda like, Oh yeah, I guess that record sucks. Or, Oh yeah, this one's awesome. And it's like, Oh no. Now I'm in the review, and you realize like, oh yeah, you're, you're throwing yourself out there. - We'd had major label offers for years. I mean, we've had major label offers for five years. We were never interested in them mostly because we were comfortable and happy where we were. We just felt comfortable with the people we were working with, working with Fat. We were happy there. They understood us, we understood them. They were friends. - We felt like Fat really stuck their necks out for it. Tom played the record for Rick Rubin and Rick loved the record. He asked us to come to LA and play a show. - Rick Rubin approaching us made total sense to us. I mean, we knew where he came from ideologically. He came from a very similar place that we came from. His record label was American Records. It was an upside down American flag, you know? I mean, we thought, wow, that's perfect. That's where we want to be. - I remember being like, "we're really just gonna fly to LA and play a show because Rick Ruben wants us to?" Like, that seems fucking lame. Like, what is this? You know? But then you think about it and you're like, well, I mean, Slayer, Johnny Cash, Beastie Boys. It was enough to turn our heads. - [Justin] After going to a major label, our punk rock career could be over. - We started getting a lot more of the criticism of becoming, you know, sellouts. But to be honest with you, we were sellouts whenever they put out the first seven inch, we were getting shit for that. "Die For the Government" came out on New Red Archives, Pat and Justin were sellouts for that. - And that's when I realized like, you know, they were going through what a lot of us went through as bands that grew up in a punk rock and hardcore scene playing political music and then found yourselves getting popular. - I was one of those kids back in the day, I'll admit, when you know, like Rancid and Green Day started picking up steam and being played on MTV. I was like, "ugh, this just sucks, dude, fuck 'em." I don't necessarily feel like they were sell outs, or I'd never labeled them as that, but the dude that used to pick on me in high school was now listening to Rancid and Green Day and rocking out to them. - When Bad Religion signed to a major label when I was 15 years old and I was mad at them for doing that, you know what I mean? And so it's something I think it's natural to kind of want to keep your favorite band that only you really know about, you and your friends know about, in your pocket. - We knew we were gonna get a shit storm for signing to a major label, but I also think that it speaks to the ambition of this band to be heard. - That started the whole slew of all the other majors becoming interested in us. - Rick Rubin was king, and if Rick wanted to sign your band and the other major labels weren't at least in presence, their bosses felt as if they weren't doing a good enough job. How did you not know about this band that Rick Rubin wants to sign? So what we ended up being a part of was this insane bidding war for Anti-Flag through a bunch of major labels who probably never listened to us, probably had no idea of what we were about, but just knew that it would look bad on their career as A&R folks if they weren't in the same room when Rick Rubin was in the room. You know, that's the quote unquote music business, and it's stupid. - And one of the things that I really enjoy doing is asking the presidents of these companies whether they were gonna have a job next year, because they knew they didn't know. They knew that the industry was collapsing, US was going war. The major media was afraid of everybody because of September 11th. A protest is one thing, but artwork and ideas in the culture that are there every day are, have a lot more power. - If you're making art that everyone can agree on, you're probably making pretty shitty art. An artist's responsibilities are very simple, in my view. It's to be true to yourself, that's it. - Going on stage and saying, you know, we're against the war in Iraq. You know, we think that it's based on a false premise and we shouldn't be there. And if you were an audience member in that crowd, you'd say, "okay, I'm at a punk rock show with a band called Anti-Flag, Rise Against, and Against Me, they're talking about how they were against the war, big surprise." But when our band started at existing outside of the punk rock world, those words had more weight to them. - This came, especially at a time where in the mainstream, there was a total vacuum about the righteousness of the Iraq war, and we felt like if we had an opportunity to insert ourselves into that discussion that we could have, we could have an effect, but ultimately when I look back on it, it was totally worth it. Would I do it again tomorrow if I had that same opportunity and I felt like I could take it and do something positive with it? Fucking right, I would. - Through it, we met a really nice guy. His name was Matt Marshall, and he signed, he's the one who signed us to RCA. - And you know, the peace movement hadn't stopped the invasion of Iraq, but what I thought was really amazing was that we had a couple of thousand punk rock kids that were not gonna go fight and kill and die for oil. And to me, that was a victory, realizing that our music had had an impact and changed some of their minds. Like it's amazing when you meet somebody who says, "you know, man, after 9/11, I was gonna join the military and then I found your band and it totally changed what I was gonna do." It was that night when I thought to myself, we made the right decision going with RCA. - Music is a really like a really strong guiding light to a lot of people of all ages from all over the world. If there's a message in there that can really get under someone's skin and make them think about the world around them, I mean, I think we're all better off. - It's pretty much changed everything. Like the way that I grew up, I guess my family is quite conservative and quite right wing ideas. And that's how I was brought up and I just didn't know any better. And then I started hearing bands like this and bands like Green Day and like Bad Religion and things like that that just changed everything. They just changed the whole way that I was thinking and the whole way that I saw the world. - And then it unlocked an entire world for us. We all of a sudden had a label in Berlin. We had a label in London. We had a label in Spain. We had a label in Japan. - Us and Against Me had a good time giving Anti-Flag shit for signing to a major label. And then as history would unfold, both of us would eventually sign to a major label. - I feel like they walked on eggshells around us because they were afraid of us. They were afraid to offend us. They didn't want to do anything wrong. They knew at any moment we could turn on them, and they were afraid of that. - [Pat] They were so afraid of us and didn't know what to do with us, they wouldn't say no. - They spent money on Military Free Zone, which was our nonprofit organization which worked to stop predatory military recruitment in schools. We had them give money to local DIY punk rock venues. We had them give money to independent media companies, you know, that we supported. (crowd cheering) - It was that the end of the Blood and Empire touring and we were touring across Canada with a band called Billy Talent. Through that entire tour we were doing coat drives 'cause it was winter in Canada. All that we asked was that if you came to the meet and greet, like bring a coat. And so every day we'd have a box and we'd fill it up with coats and then we drop it off to the local homeless shelter. And we're sitting in the food court and I got a phone call and it was my sister's ex, who is the father of my nephew. Oh, he, what he said to me was "Chrissy's dead." That was the first thing he said to me. You know, after a couple seconds of trying to like gain reference to what he was talking about or what the hell any of that meant, I found out that she was killed. Her and her boyfriend slash fiance, depending on what they told you that day in their relationship. It was actually a cousin of mine who came by and saw that the dogs were outside and that the door's open. It just looked odd to her, so she walked up the steps. They were in the dining room and you could see them right through the door. So, and, and yeah, it was over drugs. We still don't really know what happened. We know that it wasn't, if it was over drugs, it wasn't over much. It was probably 30 to a hundred dollars worth of cocaine. And she was shot twice in the back of the head and her boyfriend then, they assume, charged at the person who shot her and he was shot in the chest and the stomach. And then the guy just left out the front door. My niece was there and she was 11, 11 months old. They found her on my sister's chest whenever they came and cleaned up. And it took a, it took not long, it was maybe a day or so before they had found the murderer, as they said, and we sat there and we heard the confession tape. The kid, when they took him in, he confessed to killing them. And then what, through the trial, we watched them do a pretty good job of creating reasonable doubt, and that's all you need. He was found not guilty, and in the process, I felt insane 'cause I saw it happening. I could tell that it was being mishandled. I could tell that the prosecution was inept and that the main goal was to just create this idea that maybe it wasn't him and, and they succeeded in that because even to this day, I don't know if it was him. I heard the confession tape as well. And I don't trust police as far as I can fucking throw them to not scare a 19 year old kid, he was 18 or 19 years old, into confessing to that, so, you're challenged to, you know, all the beliefs that you have and you live in this world where you write these punk rock songs and you support the Mumia Abu-Jamal who's on death row. And then you're at the dinner table with your uncle who's saying "fry him," and you're like, well, I don't necessarily believe in the death penalty, but I also know how everyone is hurting because of this. And if this kid really did it, what's his punishment? Like, what do you do then? I still don't fucking, I don't know, I don't have a clue. (somber music) - When you're in a band for 20 some years, a lot of bad shit happens to you. When shit gets bad, the four of us are gonna be there for each other. Two, I think in his dark hours, looks to work and looks to rock and roll to distract him through the process. - [Two] I know that I was really keen on not taking a break and not putting down an instrument. I wanted to become a better musician and a better song writer and I was really focused on that. (somber music) - [Justin] In the two and a half years between "For Blood and Empire" and "The Bright Lights of America," everyone who worked on our record at RCA was let go. So we had a completely new team working "Bright Lights of America," a team that frankly wasn't invested in it at all. - [Pat] Justin brought in the idea of Tony Visconti, who did David Bowie records and had just most recently, and this is why it was on Justin's brain, done "Ringleader of the Tormentors," the Morrissey record. That record had a lot of the stuff we were talking about, had timpani, it had bells and whistles and children's choirs. - And there was a lot of things at our disposal to get a little more experimental with, like we had strings come in and play on the record. And, you know, I took a stab at banjo on the record, which, you know, I had never picked up a banjo in my life until that point. - We'd been playing long enough and we'd been playing a lot, and all of a sudden we were pretty good musicians, you know? And I think in a lot of ways, we were just really excited by that. - We were like, well, you know, if they're willing to pay for Tony Visconti, this might be a really cool experience for us to work with one of those magical producers. So let's try it. (banjo music) The record didn't sound aggressive, you know, it wasn't a very aggressive-sounding record and that was by design and, you know, we stand by it. I think that there's some of the most impactful emotional songs that we've ever done, but we saw the writing on the wall. We knew that we were done with RCA the day the album came out. You know, we got them to spend their last dime on us. - I truly feel as though we made a deal with the devil, took his gold and told him to fuck off. For me as a person to know that I fucking pissed off that many rich people and took their money, it makes me happy. - We took the RCA money and we built our own studio in Pittsburgh. Subsequently have been able to use it to record four or five releases that we've put out on AF Records of different bands. I've been able to record my friends' bands or people that I know through passing or people that I really admire and respect. So out of the major label, there's been a long reach and a long-standing victory with many spoils. - I felt as though, as a band, we had to release one record, at least one record after the major label, because I felt as though if we just would have gone, we'd been this independent punk rock band, went to a major label, and then broke up. I felt like that would be admitting defeat. - Is it more powerful to have like sort of, for a band to leave a beautiful corpse, you know, and to have the myth carry on? - I look to bands that have made long careers out of their endeavor. People need bands that are here now and present and able to filter what's happening in the world today. - You look back on like The Clash and they have this big giant catalog and everything, you know, you see Minor Threat and they have like little, you know, it's not, it's not as much. Not saying that one is more important than the other, but yeah, I think it's important for bands to like, fuck, I don't even know where I'm going with this. Damn it. Can I start over again? (laughs) - My ambitions for Rage Against the Machine were frankly unmet. Like I thought that I wanted to really see if there was any ceiling, any ceiling to what a band could do in the world of political activism and, you know, sort of the day to day, mundane, spinal tap differences that occur in every band for every garage band to every stadium band, in some ways derailed that, you know, some of those possibilities. it's not easy being a band. You know that when bands are great, they are volatile components, and Rage was certainly that. And so I feel blessed in a way that we were able to do as much as we were able to do. - I love bands with a huge catalog in the sense where it's like, you know, they've given their entire life to what they love. - Things that are over very quickly are really easy to romanticize. - The bands that really stand the test of time are like the ones that don't ever give up. - We weren't just a band who wanted it to be on a major. We were something more than that. Yeah, we came back after the major label and recorded a record, just the four of us in a room without management, without anybody else involved. And that made me very happy, and it felt much better to be that way again. Rock and roll is a difficult thing to have relationships with, because we're away for long periods of time. People grow and I stay the same. - It's weird 'cause you live this Groundhog Day life where like you don't realize really what you've been doing for like weeks maybe on end. Longevity, it's not overrated, but it's rare. - The hardest part about maintaining, like staying in a band is like, obviously the relationships. It's like, it's not a normal thing to throw four people in and have them live in a car, you know, for 10, 20 years, like be away from their friends and family. It's like, it's, you know, it sounds great, but it's really, really challenging. And I think a lot of bands, they've like they just start to hate each other. - It'd be nice to be home for, you know, like birthdays and special occasions and stuff. - Pat's relationship ended. That was a really difficult time for him. - That was when my life was in the shittiest and I was not functioning. - I had a relationship that ended. I never thought that that would happen. That that was the most shocking and difficult experience that I've dealt with in my life. - Most dudes in bands have relationships that last a year or two years or whatever. I was with my partner for 12 years. Two and Amanda were together for 10 years or so. I'm not sure exactly how long, but yeah. And the stress of going on tour every year for six months of the year or seven months of the year becomes more than most relationships can handle. You go away on tour and it feels like one day and they, the people who are you're in a relationship with have a whole life that goes on while you're not there. And then you come home and you're like, "Oh, it's like the next day," and they're like, "no, a lot of shit has happened and you haven't been here for it." - I don't know how it'll change my creative process from here on out, but I know that the songs that I've written in this timeframe are different. I know that they get played differently and I'm sad on stage, and that's a new thing for me. That's never been in my world, even for "The Bright Lights of America" record, which had songs specifically about my sister, those were never, they were still the same way. They were like, here's a thing and I'm commenting on it, not, this is what I'm living through and this is the way I really feel about it. Somebody says we need to make another record, and everybody starts talking about that, and I didn't want to do it. You know, I didn't, I felt like the normalcy that I had was destroyed by the band. Why would I start that process all again? So I was reminded of every tragedy I've faced in my life because of this, and I sat on my couch and I watched the Mike Brown verdict, and I immediately was in the courtroom with my own mother. And I saw her face and I saw images from Mike Brown's family. And I felt like this is what we talk about. This, this is what the songs are about. It's about putting a face and a reality to these situations. - Well, today we're doing, I guess the first official video shoot for the song "Brandenburg Gate," which will be the lead single for the new record, "The American Spring." (drumming) - I thought it was like a really important song for the record because it was the first time we had ever changed the shape of what we were writing. You know, normally it comes in and it's like, well, I've got these four ideas, and then someone's like, "well, there's a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri." Then you know where to direct that anger. So this was like, hey guys, I don't know who I am. And like, where do you direct that? You know? So yeah. So it's really cool, and shooting music videos is weird and you guys know this. It feels weird to have your friends just stare at you while you pantomime a song.

It's not the most exciting place to be and write and record. Where this is, we branched out, we got to go out to LA and spent about a month, month and a half out in LA. And we're actually in the sun and got to do things outside of the studio and kind of take a breather. So I think it kind of reflects in it. (upbeat punk music) - We pushed ourselves harder than ever, because to me, the conversation of do we make another one of these was like very real, especially, you know, like some of the shit I was saying earlier, like questioning if this band took everything from me and if I should give it the due diligence to work on something else, you know? If we're not going to bet on ourselves, if we're not going to work very hard, there's no sense. - When you have that many records under your belt, it doesn't matter what you do. It's we have the freedom to explore different things. (upbeat punk music) - That really helps my timing. We knew we had a limited window to work with them, and once that window was gone, it was gone. And I think it adds a certain degree of tension to the record, you never know what conversation it is that's going to spark another conversation that could be something that could lead to a lot of debate and hopefully, hopefully some change. In that respect, I've got a lot of optimism right now. - It's just a way better recording process. Everyone, I think was a lot happier in the end. - [Two] They say that it's like, moments like this are really important for creativity and they ain't lying. - The concept of the band Anti-Flag is something that I've been obsessed with since I was 16 years old, okay? I finally got this band off the ground. I love punk rock. This is where I want to be. This is what I want to do. I can't imagine that the day will come for me where I'm like, "I have nothing to say. I have no new way to say it, and I don't want to make another Anti-Flag record." - I definitely see no stopping that. You know, there's always some new fuck head around the world or, you know, that you have to weigh into. - It's right now a historic moment. We can now project the winner of the presidential race, CNN projects Donald Trump wins the presidency. The business tycoon and TV personality capping his improbable political journey with an astounding upset victory. Donald J. Trump will become the 45th president of the United States. (somber music) - Alright, so here we are. It's the morning of the apocalypse. We're in Washington DC, it's cold, I'm tired. So far, the apocalypse totally sucks. - [Man] I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. - I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. - [Man] That I will faithfully execute. - [Donald] That I will faithfully execute. - [Man] The office of President of the United States. - [Donald] The office of President of the United States. - [Man] And will to the best of my ability. - [Donald] And will to the best of my ability. - [Man] Preserve, protect, and defend. - [Donald] Preserve, protect, and defend. - [Man] The Constitution of the United States. - [Donald] The Constitution of the United States. - [Man] So help you god. - So help me god. - No KKK, no fascist USA! No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! - We're in Houston at the No Ban, No Wall, protest is happening. It was like at three, be here and this is happening. - [Crowd] No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA. - The seniors we're delivering to today are folks on one hand who grew up in this city when it was a segregated city, they were African-American growing up in the capital of the free world under the shadow of legal oppression. A lucky number of them are still here in this neighborhood now for a new era. It is an era when this neighborhood has become one of the most hip, hot, and happening communities anywhere in the country, and it's also become so expensive that they can barely afford to live here. So as we're delivering today, know that that is the history of our seniors. They know that you could be somewhere else, you could be anywhere else. Even with this little drizzle, it's kind of a beautiful day. It's a Saturday here in the end of February. You don't have to be here. You've chosen to be here, and that means so much to them because they realize that you're sending a message that society has often not sent. - Music is kind of like the part that I keep coming back to, that kind of revitalizes me and kind of gave me some direction when I was young. - When I first heard real political punk, it was like, that was, I was like, okay, that's the music I like. - My first intro to politics really was listening to Anti-Flag when I was like 13 years old. From there, like being an activist has kind of been in my blood. I decided in college to work on a number of issues, you know, as an organizer, as a fundraiser, things like that, and every issue I worked on, I realized, you know, we were coming up against same things. Either like the legislature would pass a new law that would mess up what we were doing, or the courts would hand down a new decision. And so I decided to go to law school to basically figure out how to work within those systems and then come in from the outside. - Do what you can wherever you are with whatever you got right now. So you start where you are. What around you upsets you? What around you do you think should change? - The idea of going out and protesting was exciting. That didn't always result in tangible changes, but it was something I felt like, okay, I'm out here, I'm doing something, I'm being visible, I'm being vocal. - Often it means you need other people to help you because it is do it yourself, but it's also do it together. Isolation is the biggest barrier to change. - And then just point on whatever levers of power you can. You know, I think social media is important. I know we kind of downplay like, oh, you tweeted something, it doesn't make a difference. I think it actually does. I think it drives cultural change. - Other people might not be interested in demonstrating, going out, carrying a sign, but they might be more interested and writing a letter to a Congressman or a city council person or a mayor. - Sign a petition, have a meeting with your Congressperson, call them like do everything you can. - Just open your eyes, open your heart to what's around you. You have a role to play and you have power to make that difference, so just go try to make it happen. - It's still Justin and me playing music together the same way it was Justin and me playing music together 30 years ago. At this point, if you don't like it, fuck off, I don't care. It doesn't matter to me. I want to write songs and talk to people who are interested in activism and politics, and think that the world can be different than it is right now. If that's not your thing, go away, get the fuck out. - It started as being this band that didn't give a shit about anyone but ourselves in Pittsburgh. And then it turned into, oh fuck, we have reach and power. We should care about more, we should be grandiose. We have a message, listen to it. And now it's kind of reverted back into I'm not quite sure that any of this has the power to dilute or to change or to create a paradigm shift, but when the chickens come home to roost, we're gonna be on the right side of it all. - To expect Rise Against to play a show here tonight and like however many kids come here tonight to go out and change the world tomorrow, those expectations are a little unrealistic. - The chief problem, as always, confronting those of progressive mind in the United States is apathy. And in privilege. - You won't be surprised to hear that writing a blog can't really change the world. Doesn't often happen, but it allows you to feel as the potion who is speaking that you are not powerless. And it allows those who hear you or read your blog or see your film or read your post to feel that like, or hear your song, to feel that they're not alone. And that's really crucial. - If one person came up to me in the last 15 years and said, "you've changed my life," if one person did that, I think it'd all be worth it. And the fact is that there are thousands of people who have done that. - There's always going to be a group of intelligent, driven, angry, and aware kids that will always exist. And punk rock is the greatest outlet for that. - Kind of like thousands of little cracks in a window. And you might not see the window breaking, but like every day it's cracking a little bit. And not only can it affect change, but I think musicians consistently underestimate how powerful it is, and so does the world. - Things don't change from above, things change from below, and it takes people to have the commitment and the willingness to risk to change the world. - If there's anything I believe after playing in this band over all these years, it's that music changes people and people go out and change the world.
