Northern China, closing Days of the Qing Dynasty Prince Regent, As long as one member of the Meng clan lives, we will seek revenge for your injustice! Hey, how old are you? Aren't you an opera warrior? I'm to be beheaded, sing a song to send me off. Master, listen. He sings well! Let's save this boy! Give me a brother! This performance alone deserves a scholarly title. Thank you Prince Regent! "Greatest of All Opera VVarriors" Bravo! Bravo! Masters, patrons and friends, I am honored, to welcome you here today. I want to introduce my two students. When they become masters themselves, continuing our trade, I hope all of you will give your support. Yi-Long, Er-Kui come here. Bow to our patrons. Bravo! Master Yu, we have seen your students. It's time to show us the golden plaque! I cannot claim such credit alone. The honor bestowed upon us by the Prince Regent, comes from the hard work of all our troupes. Bravo! This plaque is awarded to the best opera warrior. It does not have Master Yu's name on it. Excuse me, you are Master... I am Yue Jiang-Tian. I am opera master of the famous Shanghai Grand Theatre. Master Yue, you come from afar. I am profoundly honored. Please join us. Wait. In the South, we have no chance to perform for the Royal Family. The Regent has awarded only one plaque, which means whoever is the best opera warrior in China should keep the plaque! Master Yue, this is a day of celebration for Master Yu. Are you here to ruin the occasion? No, I do not dare. I just want to formally challenge Master Yu to a stage duel. Master Yue, you share our opera background. You understand a duel between two warriors is a serious thing. Whoever loses must break his spear, and retire from the stage. Their livelihood destroyed!! If I lose, I will break my spear, and never set foot on stage again! The northern and southern styles each have merits. It has been thirty years since the last duel. I apologize, Master Yue. I don't want to be the one who breaks 30 years of friendship. You mean you're afraid. If I refuse your challenge, no one will look down upon me! Then that means you look down upon me! Master Yue, all of us have worked hard in this field for twenty years. We have our own opera troupes, disciples and fans. Why are you so belligerent. You act like the heroes we perform on stage? For the past twenty years, we've all been playing heroes on the stage. Have we become cowards when we are off the stage? Master Yue... How dare you disrespect Master Yu! Watch out! Younger brother, apologize to Master Yue now. Everyone. You are all witnesses! They started the fight! I can take all of them on alone. Come and get me! Master. Bravo! Master. Watch your step. You are full of hot air. No one will consider you a hero. Losers are always forgotten. Just watch. Master Yue, the plaque is yours. Master Yu. According to the tradition, the loser must break his spear and never perform again in public. Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Back off! When you're grownups, look for me in Shanghai. Bastard Regent! Bastard Yue Jiang-Tian Bastard Regent! Bastard Yue Jiang-Tian Bastard Regent! Bull's eye. I threw that one. No, it was me! No, I threw it! I threw it! You have such skills? I'm the elder disciple. What elder... Master. You threw that huh? Master. Master. Come with me! Repeat loudly. Knife throwing is a lowly circus act. We will never practice it. We are disciples of "The Mightiest Opera Warrior-Actor" Never mention these words! We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We will perform only the true opera arts. Repeat it a hundred times! We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We must practice only the true opera arts. We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We must practice only the true opera arts. We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We must practice only the true opera arts. We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We must practice only the true opera arts. We are traditionally trained Opera VVarriors. We must practice only the true opera arts. Er-Kui, when we grow up, we must avenge our master, bring back the plaque. I don't want the plaque! Why? It's the highest recognition among all Opera VVarriors. It's similar to getting first place in the imperial exams. The plaque was awarded by the Regent, At least you have known your parents. I've never seen mine. This walnut pendent is the only thing they left me. Stop. Knee! down. You have finished your training. I have nothing left to teach you. Your apprenticeship is complete. It's time for you two to leave. Master, we want to look after you. We will not leave you. I don't need to be taken care of. Leave the mountain, and become masters. Make a name for yourself. Carry on the Yu-style Warrior-Acting. Don't let me down. Master, don't worry. When we become famous, we will come back to you. As brothers, you each have a different personality. It is good to count on each other. When you start working, with all the complications of city life, it would be best to stick together. If that's not possible, you must be honorable! You are heroes on stage, you must also be exemplary in real life. We promise to remember this, master. You must promise me three things. First of all, never perform lowly circus acts. You are disciples of "Mightiest Opera Warrior". Second, never have an affair with an actress. It is the rule handed down by our ancestors. Third, Never duel with Opera Warriors. When a warrior must break their spear, everything is lost. Shanghai Er-Kui, are you hungry? A little bit. Let's find a place to eat. Okay. Brother, look, there's a lot of people there. It looks quite festive. Let's go take a look. Tonight here at Shanghai Grand Theatre. Master Yue, the best warrior at eight o'clock will perform Farewell my Concubine. Brother? I see it. Who are you people? Get out of our way! Look, Maetro Xi is here! Where did you two come from? Peking. What are you here for? To take back that plaque. Nonsense! Just the two of you? Someone hand me a sword! Wait! We don't fight with women. Tell your master, we challenge him, just like fifteen years ago. Stand closer together let's take a photo! Great. One more! They said like fifteen years ago... Fifteen years ago? What happened fifteen years ago? All these years, because of the plaque, countless Opera Warriors have ruined their careers challenging me. There are many that want revenge. I don't worry about them. Let them come! Master, I believe there is no one in this world that can defeat you, certainly not those two hayseeds. Shanghai food is too sweet, needs more garlic and chili. Mu-Lang I intend to marry you. The rules of our ancestors forbid it. I'm the "Mightiest of the Opera VVarriors". I make the rules! Extra! Extra! The duel starts at eight tonight, at the Grand Theatre. Read all about it! That should be our mater's face on the poster, brother. Let's put your face up there brother! Extra! Extra! The duel starts at eight tonight, at the Grand Theatre. Two students of Master Yu, the northern style opera warrior, challenge Master Yue at the Grand Theatre. Hey! Everybody listen! Change of plans. We're switching to "Batter of the Flags" Quickly! "Batter of the Flags" Quickly! Quickly! General Lu, you have come. General Lu, This is the British Concession. Dueling is prohibited. What do you think? Although this is the British Concession, Opera Warriors are part of our Chinese culture. It's not a street brawl. Whose laws are they breaking? General Lu, May I take a photo? Win! Bravo! Bravo! Er-Kui. If we lose, I will break my spear; and you return to Peking. Brother, we won't lose. We are wearing master's costumes! Bravo! We have come! Welcome! Win! Start drumming. Start drumming! Enough! Stop the fight. We lose. Move aside! Master, we have lost. We lost. I have lost. Wait! Everyone. According to the Opera Warrior tradition, Master Yue must... break his spear. Break the spear! Quiet! Break the spear! Break the spear! Master Yue! Master! Here's your first salary advance. You two are so young, you are famous now. Carry on the good work, if you want to keep the golden plaque! Er-Kui. What is it, brother? We will live here. Brother, up to you. Do you like it? I'll buy one for you tomorrow. It looks expensive. Er-Kui. From now on, you don't need to worry about money. Only think about what you like. Excuse me, Er-Kui. What shall we drink? I will follow you. Alright. Two shots of each. All of them? That's very expensive. The more expensive the better! Quickly! Maetro Xi. Life is like a drama. Thanks. I think drama is like life. Maetro Xi, I'm one of your most devoted fans. I have seen every opera you've performed. Shanghai's most respected Police General Lu. You're too kind. I'm only a humble stage performer. I don't deserve your attention. I'm telling you, whether you like it or not, nowadays you can't find better Opera Warriors than these two boys. They will play the leads. They don't have a troupe. If you are willing to stay, everything will continue as it was. Where is my chair? Bring him a chair. No need. I'll stand. I heard that some of you are not willing to perform with us. That's okay. This oldman can stay, the rest can do as you please. Brother, how can we perform operas without a female star like Maetro Xi? I will follow you. You don't need to talk it over. I'd rather die than join the ones who killed our master! We perform because we have to make a living. Just because you played a hero on stage for three days, you believe you're a real hero. Stop the quarrelling. In our troupe, Mu-Lang is our leader now. We'll follow Mu-Lang's decision. I can't think right now. Could you allow us a few days to talk it over? Mu-Lang, I'm sorry... As you know, the theatre has to remain open. The show must go on! I'm old, I have no place to go. I'll stay. I've got a family to feed. We make our living performing on stage. Mu-Lang, we will follow you. Let's change theatre, and start somewhere else. We will follow you, Mu-Lang. Well, as my little brother said hopes Miss Xi will stay. Otherwise... Otherwise what? What Master Guan means is... I'll stay. Great! You guys should thank the two masters! Quick, bring tea. You all should work together on stage. Don't play tricks! Our Master Yu had a rule: never accept a toast once you're the lead. I, on behalf of elder brother, toast you all. Yi-Long. Yi-Long. Yi-Long. Thanks a lot. Bravo! General Lu. Which two should be executed for the robbery case. General Lu. All of them? Yes Sir. Bravo! Sit down. Sit down! Er-Kui, they don't even cheer for great action. They're... a bunch of idiots! Let's go. Your performance of Lu Wen Long. The way you move with the double spears, your spins and somersaults are so exquisite. I have seen many warrior actors in my lifetime, but I've never seen anyone like you. General Lu. General Lu. Welcome! Please have a seat. General Lu. Please have some tea. General Lu. Let me introduce you to our new lead Opera Warrior, Guan Yi-Long. Master Guan. This is the head of the police department in the British Concession, General Lu. Our business prospers thanks to him. General Lu. Thanks for protecting our business. You're welcome. As a policeman, it's my duty to preserve the public order. What brings you here to our backstage? Mu-Lang's performance, gets better and better each day. Yi-Long, let me treat you to a western movie. Garbo's new movie. Yi-Long is not here. This room is for the lead performers only. Didn't your master teach you? Such bad manners. Sorry, our master never taught us that. My brother and I have shared the same bed since childhood. Er-Kui, your craft is as good as your brother's. Why are you willing to play his sidekick? You play well as my brother's lover. Seems to me you quite enjoy it. That's just acting! You're acting is great! Come back! Er-Kui. Here's a flower basket from General Lu. He'd like to see you. Put the flowers here. Say that I'm unwell. Wait, I'll see him in a bit. Er-Kui. This is General Lu. He is taking really good care of our theater. General Lu? Was that you sending the flowers? Mu-Lang has the flowers. You sent the flowers, drank our tea. What else do you want? Er-Kui. What I want is not your business. General Lu, what is the plan. Those two actors are really common, not my cup of tea. Er-Kui. Ignore him. Next we have The Monkey King Yi-Long, Yi-Long, Yi-Long. Master Guan give me your autograph? Sure. General Fang is not in Shanghai? He's off fighting a war. I don't even know who he's fighting. Personally, I hope he fights this war forever, and never comes back. You're so naughty. Let's go. Ok. Let's go. Wait. Stop for my brother. Hey. You're in the wrong place again... I'm here to apologize to you. It's fine. I've forgotten it already. Mu-Lang. I'm going back to Peking in two days. I got you a powder box. How come? You're thinking of not coming back? Are you going back to get married? Is your fiancee strict? No, it's not like that. Then what for? Is it something shameful? Er-Kui. You have to come back. We still haven't performed together. I will. I will come back for sure. I'll leave you to your make-up. Er-Kui. You haven't been in Shanghai long... you have seen so little of the city. Would you like to go boating with me tomorrow? With my brother? Up to you. Master Guan, I have transformed your heroic deeds into a song. Would you like to hear it? No need. My brother... hates flattery. Er-Kui. When Yue Jiang-Tian took the golden plaque from our master, didn't the story tellers sing a song? It's our turn. Why not? Sing. Sing loudly! Master Guan crushed Master Yue. Er-Kui. So what is next? I don't know yet. I have not thought about it. Er-Kui. Why didn't you dance? You just sat there the whole night eating peanuts. I really don't get those western dance moves. Er-kui. Compared to our training, the western dance steps are as easy as walking. Yi-Long, why did you stop dancing? I'm done. I need to have a talk with my brother. So tonight... You should go home first. Let's meet another day. I need to go back to Peking. Go back to Peking? We're doing great here... why go back? We should stick together. Okay. Later, you can be the lead, and I'll be your sidekick. Elder brother. It's not because of that. Then why? I have some personal matters to attend to. I could perform whenever I want. We have avenged our master. Now it's time to avenge my family. I don't want anyone else involved. This is a new era! This is a new China. The Prince Regent is long dead... Brother. For the past six months performing as your sidekick, I have been busy. I have gathered all the information on the whereabouts of the Prince Regent's sons. All but one illegitimate son born to a maid-in-waiting. Now I am going to kill all those seven princes. Okay. I'll go with you. Brother. Seeking revenge is a dangerous thing. We are the only two proteges of Master Yu. Someone has to continue his art. I'll avenge my family, you repay our obligation to master Yu. The same as it is in the operas we sing. Okay. I'll buy the ticket for you. Peking The Sixth Prince was murdered. We're off. Are you not leaving. We still have things to discuss. Please go without us. Is everything prepared? It looks like we don't have a chance today. The Fourth Prince was murdered. He is coming. Leave! Quickly. Move! Don't shoot! Yi Long, get on the horse. Chase them. Quickly! Go after them. Quickly! Damn it! General Feng. You brought so many men tonight, is it to escort me home? Xiao Yu! You're my husband right? If I'm to go home, please escort me yourself. General, this is your affair, I suppose you'll handle this yourself. A gun? You dare? Mu-Lang. How did you know I was there? I have lived in Shanghai for 10 years. I certainly hear the gossip. You spy on me? No. You keep such a public profile! Everybody knows what you're up to. Naturally I know. Why did you come to my rescue? All our troupe members' livelihood depends on you. Master Guan. Your master and I... were enemies. My master's demise was caused by that golden plaque. Whoever possesses it... will have no peace. You've never owned the plaque. If you had, you'll understand its power. I don't want it. Its power comes from men's pride. If you were a woman, you'd understand. You should go. I have to go back for something. Go back? You will be killed! I've left something in the car. What? A small walnut pendant I've carried since I was born. I've got to get it back. The Fifth Prince was murdered. Cigarette, cigar, lighter for sale. Master. Master, Master. Two officers have been waiting for you all afternoon. Master Guan, no wonder you're the star. Even your way of pouring a simple cup of tea, is extraordinary. Gentlemen, please come see me perform when you have time. I've much to give my audience. Master Guan, we're here today not because we want to see your performance. You should know why we're here. I don't know. Please, enjoy your tea. Please take a look. Master Guan, SS YOU Can SSS, the spear wounds are identical. Very professional! Who could have possibly done it? That's why we came to talk to you. Gentlemen. Where are you from? Peking. Peking? But we're in the British Concession in Shanghai. This is a crime that has shocked the whole nation. We have talked to General Lu. He has promised his full cooperation. He is very concerned about this case. Then you're talking to the right person. It looks like I'm the one who did it. In fact, I am the only one capable of doing it. You must be joking, Master Guan. We have already investigated and know that you've been performing every single night. Also. There's quite a distance between Shanghai and Peking; it's no daily commute. Then it couldn't have been me. Master Guan, we're very sure you're not the killer. But, we remember when Master Guan first came to Shanghai to challenge the Opera VVarriors. There were two of you. Your brother Er-Kui possesses similar skills. He has not been on stage lately. Where is he? He's ill. Even if he was in good health, he still couldn't have managed this. He does not have the skills. Otherwise, the golden plaque would have been his, and not mine. We'd like to see him. Sure. Are you in a hurry? Yes. Okay. How about tomorrow? I'll put him on stage, and you two can watch his performance. Good. We'll come again tomorrow, and we'll be watching for you in the theatre. Thank you, Master Guan. Please see yourself out. Who could have such hatred? There has been three murders already. The spearheads are thrown so that it hits the same spot each time. Who died this time? Sons of the Regent. They were murdered one after another. According to the newspaper, there are only two sons of the Regent left. One is a love child, taken from the Regent Mansion when he was born. No one knows where he is. Could it be you? Maybe... Each time when I'm performing "Hamlet". I always wonder why I feel so familiar with it. When you finish performing, you can continue dreaming at home. Master Guan. What brings you here so early? I have something important to discuss with you. Where are you going? Can I give you a lift? Anything but helping you out like the other night. Please don't mention that again. I haven't even thanked you appropriately for last time, and here I am needing your help again. But, it's serious this time. What's so important that makes Master Guan offer to be my driver? Tonight, can we perform "The Monkey King" together? Are you crazy? I am not a man. I am serious. I just want you to play the white tiger in Er-Kui's style. Just once? Where is Er-Kui? Don't ask. If you don't explain to me, I won't do it. You and your troupe earn your living from our theatre, all because of Er-Kui. If you won't help, I'll find someone else to do it! Are you going to perform or not? I'll perform. So this is what the Shanghai opera house. I have never worn such ugly make-up. From the back, you still look like a beautiful woman. You think I can pull it off? Sure, you are Shanghai's best Peking Opera Actress. The role of the non-speaking white tiger should be no problem for you. Master Guan, this is the first time you have praised someone since your arrival. Maetro Xi, You are too kind. After all, you are my elder. What's on your back? Look at the time. We still have much to prepare. You go on, I'll be right behind you. How come this white tiger is played by a female? Seventh Prince. No thanks. I heard you're a big connoisseur of Beijing opera. Of course. Are you sure about this? Of course. I have watched opera since I was a child. The gold plaque that hangs there was personally given by my father to Yi-Long's master, Yu Sheng Ying. So that means... No thanks. Yi-Long is playing with us? Not to worry, let's wait and see. Yi-long. Did we pull it off? We can't think about it now. Just keep going. As long as the action is captivating, no one will complain. Er-Kui. Er-Kui. Er-Kui. Everyone is looking for you, and now you're here. Go in as white tiger now. Brother. Come with me first. See that person in the balcony... That's the Seventh Prince! Elder brother! Er-Kui. The two beside him are policemen from Peking. They questioned me yesterday. They suspect you are the murderer. They must have used the Seventh Prince as bait to lure you here! Let's go. Brother. That day when all my family members were executed you were there! You saw it! Even my little sister was beheaded! I have to kill him today! He'll be gone tomorrow. No matter what, you can't do it tonight!! Not here! If you don't perform, Mu-Lang will be in trouble as well. Perform first! Put on the make up for the green dragon. All three of us will appear on stage together. What's happened? Er-Kui is here in the theatre. We have to help him. What do you mean? He murdered people. Who did he kill? The princes mentioned in the newspaper. Er-Kui is...? The Flying Spear Killer? The Peking police have traced him to theatre. The Seventh Prince is sitting in the balcony. If he makes his move tonight, it'll be all over for him. Quickly! Bravo! It's really Meng Er-Kui. Seven Prince, this time I think you got it wrong. This time, General Lu and both of us have it all wrong. Prince, I have to say, it is wise for you to go abroad. Well. The Flying Spear Killer could strike out of nowhere at anytime. Nobody Leaves!!! He was killed during the curtain call, so that means you three couldn't have done it. We just want you to inspect the wound. This happened during your stage performance. Look, the way he is killed, do you know who else in your troupe is capable of doing this? What's wrong? Your performance was poor today. The audience noticed. What's wrong? I keep thinking about last night. What happened last night? My whole life, I've always thought I was an orphan. Yesterday I realized I wasn't. When I finally found out who my family is. What did you find out? I'm the missing prince. I am the one Er-Kui wants to kill! Mu-Lang. Er-Kui. I have always wanted to ask you one question. Please ask. You've been with the people who killed your master day after day, have you ever thought of revenge? Why? One day as a teacher, a parent for life, isn't that the saying? That's why I have to repay my debt of gratitude! Debt of gratitude? Yes. My master left me the whole troupe. I have to support them. I have to keep their families fed, keep them working on the best stage in Shanghai. That's true. I have yet to show my gratitude to my master. I have to avenge my loved ones as well. Sooner or Later. Have you found your last target? Yes, I have. What are you going to do? Brother, remember what you told me when we were growing up? Yes, I remember. I also owe your family seven lives. Let's settle this on stage. May our ancestors decide our fate. Sure. Master Guan. You seem to be troubled by something. We've prepared wine to help you feel better and relax. Come. Cheers. What are you up to? They thought that I was feeling down, so... There's no drinking back stage. Have you all forgotten the rules? Master Guan is feeling down today. We just want to help him relax. Alcohol will only cause more sorrows. Yi-Long, go home and rest. Thank you. Master. You've left us too soon. There are many things you have yet to teach us. Master! Father. Mother. I have found the last son of the Regent. He is my classmate and brother. He has always been kind to me. Why don't you fight back? Master Meng, you are now the mightiest of the Opera VVarriors. There must be many ladies chasing after you. Really? How come I have not heard about them? I'm not like my elder brother. He had lots of adoring fans. You two ended on such terrible terms yet you still call him your elder brother? The rules were laid down by our master. Everything I have now comes from my master. I don't understand the traditions of your trade. I thought you had a rule that forbids Opera Warriors to sleep with a fellow actress? After hearing this, I started thinking. What if, a relationship did occur between them? That's our own business. You don't need to worry about it. The Flying Spear Killer seems to have vanished without a trace. We the police can't seem to find any trace of him. Amazing. I would like to hear your thoughts, Master Meng. What is your take on this? This seems like the business of the police. We Opera Warriors commit murder every single day... but that's just stage acting. General Lu. Come. I drink to you. We'll do the same opera tomorrow. Sure. Flowers? It's okay. Need a rickshaw? Do you want a ride? No thanks. I have a friend waiting for me. Follow her. Thank you for driving me home. We're here now. Why don't you invite me upstairs for tea? It's not the right time yet. One has been resolved, what about the other one? I don't know. I haven't thought of it yet. Let me tell you what can be done. I'll arrest Meng Er-Kui and execute him. You will have your revenge. You're going to arrest him on what grounds? Meng Er-Kui is the Flying Spear Killer. He has taken seven lives. If I don't know that by now, how can I call myself a policeman? Don't look at me that way. I know you are fond of him. You actresses. How can you not fall for handsome opera warriors? Sadly, his poses, the expression in his eye, is only acting! Once he's off the stage, he is nothing! I just want the golden plaque. I don't intend to kill anybody. Fine. I'll give you three days. Get the plaque and send it to your master. I'll be at home, waiting for you. Don't play any tricks. This is Shanghai. You performers can't fool me. No tricks. Three days. Wait for me. Er-Kui. Come out. I see you. I always thought you were a gentleman, it seems I was wrong. Shame on you! What did you say? Shame on you! All this time... All this time you were having an affair with your master! It is love, not adultery! Look! Look! Look at this! You tattooed his face on your body, and in the appearance of conqueror Xiang Yu! Why didn't you kill yourself like the concubine in the story. Well. Now that you know about it, I'll tell you more. I did love my master, but now I despise him. I believe the concubine also hated the conqueror before she died. Conqueror only think about their power! But when Romeo died, Juliet didn't fall for his enemy. You play the beauty who rescues the hero. All because you want to seduce my brother! There was nothing between your brother and I! It's because my brother is smarter than I am. He could see the relationship between you and your master! Your master cheated in order to win the plaque from my master! Shame on him! Rubbish! If my master had been ten years younger, he would have easily beaten both you and your brother. Now I defeated my brother, and I'm the boss. Seduce me! Come! I want to challenge you for the plaque. If I win, the plaque will be mine. You don't need to break your spear. If you win, I will disappear forever. Get up. Pick up the sword. Get up. Mu-Lang. Enough! Look out! You win. The plaque is yours. What did you say? Take the plaque. I love you. I gave you information about General Feng's mistress and Guan Yi Long. I arranged the Peking detectives and the seventh prince. I planted the walnut pendant on the prince's body. I have kept all my promises, have you kept yours? I have promised a lot of people a lot of things... I realize I can only keep one promise. I would repay you in my next lifetime, but sadly, my next lifetime is already owed to someone else. I'll end my life to pay for the debts I owe you. But, I beg you please spare Er-Kui... Beautiful acting. Maetro Xi, which opera is this? Sacrifice yourself to save your lover. Here's all the evidence. Take it with you. People say, "prostitutes are heartless, and actors are worse". How affectionate and faithful you are. The door is over there. Get out! What are you doing? The Flying Spear Killer has been found! What? You're cancelling the shows? The tickets are sold out already! What am I going to tell people now? It's my fault. I really don't want to perform any more. I have to find my brother. Find your brother? You've crippled him, ruined his whole career, and now you want to go look for him? That's the grudge between our ancestors. All the debts have been repaid. Before our Master passed away, he told us no matter what happens, we have to stick together. All my past earnings are with you. You can keep all of it. You have gained our respect as an honorable man. Let us give you a toast. Thank you all. I wish you all great performances with your new boss. Finally we have settled our revenge. Today, Master Yue may rest in peace. Miss, we are here. Thanks. Mu-Lang, I was coming to... give you the plaque. I wanted to see you. Mu-Lang. I want to marry you. Marry me? We already... I have forgotten about us. Er-Kui, forget about us. Forget about everything here. Er-Kui! Er-Kui! You are poisoned. You will never speak. You have lost your voice. Yi-Long is not a prince. The whole story was set up. You have taken your vengeance and I have taken mine. I guess we can call it even now? I hope you and your brother are together once again. You two are together give such wonderful performances. Even after everything I have done, I must admit, I love you. But I have to be faithful to him. I have taken the plaque with me. In this world, only I can bring him eternal peace. Our Encounters are just like the operas on stage. I can't repay my debt to you in this life. So I will repay you in my next life. I am sorry for the things I've done. Good bye. Please remember the operas we performed on stage. It's time for us to go home, brother. Do you remember the three rules the Master told us to keep? Never practice lowly circus skills, never practice Knife throwing. In the end, we did that. Master said never challenge other opera warriors. We did that, too. Master also said never have an affair with a fellow actress. At least we have kept that promise. How come you didn't nod? Does that mean you...?
