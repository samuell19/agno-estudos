Hurry boys. More paper. Alright. Here you are boys. Take it away. More paper. More paper. Hey, leave that alone. That is my autobiography. It's going to have a wide circulation in just a few minutes. Hey everybody. Mr Corey is back. He is coming up. Mr Corey is back. Hey, Miss Cronin. Mr Corey is back. Look at that helmet. He brought it just for me. Hello! Delighted to see you. How are you, Lou? Hello, Jim. Still got fallen arches? They got better on Armistice Day. Welcome home, Mr Corey. Hey. You are new here aren't you? - Yes, sir. I've heard a lot of about. How was the war? - We won. Hello Bill. - Glad to see you. Well old-timer, what do you know? Thanks for the postcards. - Well, I knew you were saving stamps. Gee, thanks Mr Corey. I promised him a helmet and he got a helmet. Did you have to kill him to get it, Mr Corey? No, I sort-of persuaded him. He held up his hands and yelled out "Kameraden". I fixed my bayonet, advanced on him and .. And paid 20 francs for it at a souvenir shop. Boys and girls. Meet the army. Roger Ordway, formerly dramatic critic on The Chronicle. Mike Reynolds. Night editor of The Chronicle. Tommy Jarvis. Lieutenant, US Army. Welcome home, Bruce. You are looking fine. It's Croney. It's fine to see you back, Mr Corey. Well, it is fine to be back. Welcome home, Bruce. Great to have you back. - Well, thanks chief. I got some good news for you. - Fine. I kept your job open. It is all ready for you. So rest your pants at your old desk and warm it up. I've got some good news for you too, chief. For me? - Yes, for you. Oh? What is it? Come on in. I'll tell you all about it. Hi boys. Come in to the boss's office. Step right in. Mr Peck. Alright, boys. Sit down won't you, Mr Peck. Thank you. Meet the editorial staff of the Daily Doughboy. You got a copy of The Doughboy? - Sure. - Thank you, Charlie. This is a the paper that we got off to the American army in France. Indeed? We started publication printing twenty copies a day in a broken-down farmhouse. We ended up publishing 150,000 copies a day from a swank office in Koblenz. Now, we have buried the paper in Europe and brought back the brains. I was editor of the only paying proposition in the AEF. I've brought you back a great idea, Mr Peck. Home two minutes and you want to change things. Now wait a minute. I'll show you what I'm after. Ah, yeah. Well, here is your Sentinel. Now I am a strap-hanger. Step over here, Mr Peck. You too, boys. Get around me. Come along. Come along now. I want to show you something. Now we are part of the millions going to work .. In subways and elevated trains and buses, streetcars, ferries. I'm coming home and I am trying to read my paper and I've got The Sentinel sure. So what? Now look. I'm trying to read it when I'm pressed as tight as a sardine in a can. Now it is big. It's bulky. You know, you can't turn the pages. Well, you can't even read what you've got there. Now Mike, give me a copy of the Daily Doughboy. Don't go away. You stay here will you. This is every enlightening. As a publisher you ought to know this. Now look. Now there is the Daily Doughboy. See? Go on, crowd around me. Push all you want. See how easy I'm reading it? Turning the pages with absolute comfort and peace. There, you see? You suggest we change the shape of The Sentinel? No, Bruce. The Sentinel has been that shape for forty years. No, no, Mr Peck. I'm not out to change The Sentinel. The Sentinel is an institution anyway. I'm out to start a brand-new paper. Now, this handy shape will catch the public. But it's what we put in it that is going to hold them. Now, The Sentinel doesn't publish news until it happens. We publish it while it's happening. Before it happens. Nonsense. Well, times have changed, Mr Peck. You know the war has done things to people. We've made life cheap and that's made emotions cheap. Now, death has lost its dignity. There is no privacy left. As far as this generation is concerned, keyholes were made to look through. What they can't spy on personally they must read about or see in photographs. Now hold on a minute, Bruce. The Sentinel stands for clean journalism. We leave the dirt to the people who make vacuum cleaners. Okay, Mr Peck. If that's the way you feel. But I tell you this is going to be revolutionary. Comes the revolution let me know. Come on Mike, let's get over to our rag. After all we have a living to make. Well, goodbye Mr Peck. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mike. - So long. Remember me? - Huh? Oh yeah. I'm putting the Lieutenant to work. I got sorta used to having him around me during the war and I'm keeping him on. Come on, Lieutenant. - Goodbye, Mr Peck. Bruce, I sure appreciate this. Boy. - Yes, sir? Take Lieutenant Jarvis to the morgue. The morgue? Well, I thought I might get a chance to cover sports. I'm not keen about crime reporting. Well the morgue, my dear Lieutenant, is the reference room. Croney, how are you these days? Oh, I stick around. Aren't you glad to be back? Oh yeah. Sure I am glad. Well, you didn't even notice your flowers. Oh, I am sorry. Yes. They are nice. Hey, who padlocked my desk? Why can't things be left alone around here for a few weeks. Here. I kept it locked to keep your junk for you. You're a sweet guy, you know it. You used to say I was a darned good newspaperman. And there's nothing sweet about them. Well, you've got feminine or something since Mr Peck made you his secretary. So sorry. This is Miss Cronin. Will you get me Mr Peck's tailor. No, I'll take it on this phone. Where's that picture of me shaking hands with Woodrow Wilson? I have it at home. It might have got lost here. Mr Jones? I want that picture. It's the only one I ever had of me in a bow-tie. Mr Peck is sending a Mr Corey over, one of his men here for a couple of suits. Wait a minute, I can't afford .. - Charge it to Mr Peck. A plain blue and a grey one. Don't let him pick out any black and white check. Well I must say I never expected the chief to do a thing like that for me. He didn't. I did. I'll take it out of your salary. The army ought to learn discipline from women. Is it going to be tough taking orders again after .. Running your won newspaper in France? You know, Croney. I had an idea of running my own paper here. A new kind of slant on things. Well, why don't you? You can run a paper. You've proven it. I don't need The Sentinel, do I. - Of course not. I know just the people I want with me. I can see the makeup of every page. All I need is a little thing. The money. And that's a cinch. Wall Street is paved with it and banks are loaded with it. Everybody is just aching to take a flyer somewhere. Money? That's easy when you know how. I am going to see .. It will take $300,000 Colonel but in a month we'll rock New York with it. Corey. Do you realize what building you are in? Oh yes, I come here often. On a pass. Come here. Down in that hall there is 10,000 seats. And it's my job to keep them filled. Day and night, twelve months a year. I got to have prize fights, hockey games, bike races. Circuses, dog shows, everything under the sun. And any one of them might go under and cost a fortune. Do I look like a guy that can .. That can fool around in another business? What are you looking for? My hat. You know. I smile through my pain. The trouble is, Corey. The fables you newspapermen dream up about me aren't true. I'm not a big gambler at all. I take chances at times. Who doesn't? You need a bigger gambler than I am. Yeah. Maybe you got something. A bigger gambler? Yeah. Thanks. A bigger gambler. Hi, Croney. Well? Well what? Come clean. You've had something on your mind for the last couple of days. What is it? Gambling. How much did they take you for? Nobody is taking anybody. Yet. Hello? Hey. There is a mug on here what calls himself Shino McGoon. I'll take it. Yep? Hello, Mr Corey. I finally got what you want on Merrill Lambert. He fixed the jumper race today for Lady Fry to win. And he's got 200 grand riding on her nose. Two hundred thousand? You sure? Well thanks, Shino. If anybody asks for me you don't know where I am. Well, what's up Bruce? Can't a fellow take a day off? - Not you. I know that single track mind of yours. And it looks like somebody is going to get run over. Maybe. Keep your eye on number 6 Lady Fly. Are you sure? It has got to be. You catch on, mister sportswriter? The jockey had a fall off the favorite. What for? - To let Lady Fly win. He couldn't pull his horse so he took a nose dive. He didn't get hurt either. Merrill Lambert is going to. Bruce Corey, eh? Maybe it's time I met him. - The number is Lexington 5- 400. Had I better talk to him, Merrill? The police have tapped that phone months ago. This one is private. Lexington 5-400. You think of everything. Well if you lawyer did a little bit of thinking maybe I wouldn't have to. Sometimes I think the Georgie Pelotti here is the only one I can depend on. It wasn't nothing, boss. I just says to that Detroit bookie: Will you believe that newspaper or are you going to believe me? He is a reasonable guy after you hit him a few times. Bruce Corey, please. You know, that Detroit bookie is the only one that paid off. I can't sue them, I can't sue the papers. What have it got a lawyer for? So they can't sue you. Oh .. Hello? Corey? Merrill Lambert. It's the call I've been waiting for. I was wondering if we couldn't have a little chat. Yeah. Tonight. I understand there's a floating crap game going on around town. How about there? Sure. What's the address? Nobody knows yet. You see, the game is played in a different spot every night. Unless you are okayed you can't find it. I'll have somebody pick you up at twelve. Yeah. Goodbye. Pick him up at twelve. - And deliver him? Yes. Right to the warehouse. - All in one piece? Yes, Jerry. I don't even want him chipped. Merrill Lambert ruled off the turf. [ Door knocks ] Okay, John. Mr Corey. - Step in, Mr Corey. Okay. Corey. Just a second. I'm sorry, Fenton. See you in my office tomorrow? Alright. Hi, Corey. - Hi. Rather dull stuff you've been printing lately, don't you think? About you, you mean? - That's it. I don't print it. I just write it. I have to make a living. Maybe you'd make a better living if you laid off. Sounds like you've got a proposition in mind. Yes, I have. Come here for a minute, will you. You know, Corey. I'm looking for a man to handle my .. Well, let's call it my "public relations". At the salary of 25 grand a year. I'm sorry, but I am already working for half a million people. Well, what about 25 grand to forget me? I've got a good memory and my typewriter likes to talk. Sit down, won't you. You know I am a businessman, Corey. There must be some proposition we could get together on. No. I don't think so. We might get together at that. This wouldn't be right for you. It's too legitimate. Oh, I like legitimate investments. It sounds like you have got a proposition in mind. In France, I made a paper famous. You could read it shoulder-to-shoulder in the trenches. Another tabloid, sure. But this is going to be mine. Nothing in it but nerves. The whole front page: sock headline. Murders, secrets, scandals, pictures. The town is mad for sensation. These are exciting times. - How much will it take? Well. More than you have got there. You want to make a bet on that? Well it will take $300,000 even if we use second-hand presses. You know, it takes a pile of money to start a paper. Well. There is my half. Now where is yours? I haven't got it. Can you raise it? - No. Well, that's .. Half way to a newspaperman's heaven. Or maybe half way to the other place, huh? I know a quick way to get two for one. What's the matter, you afraid? What if I lose? Well, you .. You give me $150,000 worth of free publicity. No dice. Then you will just owe me $150,000. How long have I got to pay it? I always give people the rest of their lives. Well, Pelotti. What do you have in Detroit? Seven, the loser. Next shooter. Would you mind passing the dice. Shoot a hundred and fifty thousand. - What? Feed it. New dice please. Seven, the winner. It's easy when you know how. My compliments, partner. You wouldn't like to press your luck, would you? No thanks. Well, there you are. - Thank you. I'll see you in my office tomorrow then? - Yep. Just a moment. You can't wander around with all that money in your pocket. Somebody might .. Jerry. Drive Mr Corey home, will you. Yes, sir. Much obliged. What's up? - Your hands. Where is that dough, sucker? You know, I kinda suspected this Lambert escort service. Cut the gab and give me the dough. Good work, Tommy. Thanks for obeying orders, kid. - That's alright. I just didn't want to write another obituary. It seems to me I'm very considerate in selling you an insurance policy. It would cover your IOU. My daughter gets the money if I die, doesn't she? Hmm. Of course. Naturally, she assigns it to me until you pay the fifty grand. You want to die owing a lot of money, do you? You'll be notified when the premium payments are due. I've explained I don't see how I'll ever be able to raise .. You gotta raise it. The policies I sell don't lapse. "Yes?" - Send Corey in. Well. Quite a layout. Win it? Yeah. Minding my business. Real estate and insurance. Insurance? Well, well. What's the matter it? I am sorry. Did you see the papers this morning? A couple of them. That was quite a storm at sea, wasn't it. Come on, let's skip the pleasantries. What about our newspaper? Well, your lawyer draws up the legal papers and mine takes out the larceny. You get half the stock and half the profits and that's all. I'm a silent partner? Elaborately. Running it is my job. Send Kaper in. Sure. You go ahead and run it. What do I know about a newspaper anyway? Merrill, have you got a spy in my office? You always send for me when I am going out for a manicure. Corey, this is Phil Kaper, my attorney. Mr Corey and I are going to start a newspaper. We are equal partners. What's the name of it? The New York Mercury. I will draw up the papers. Wait a minute. What kind of a paper? Is this legitimate? Certainly. - Sure. Then I can do it quicker than usual. I'll get started right away. Thank you, Mr Kaper. So long. - So long. Oh. You know that bodyguard, Jerry? - Yeah. Well, between you and me. He can't be trusted. Here it is, chief. "New York Mercury makes its bow. All the news all the time." That's okay for the headline. Got that cartoon of the knickerbocker holding a baby in his arms? - Got it. I want a page of telegrams. Congratulations from celebrities. Prize-fighters, actors, writers, senators. Split it up evenly between the democrats and the republicans. Well, did we get the telegrams? - Sure. Two of them. Make up the rest. Celebrities love to see their names in the papers. Aren't you afraid of being sued? That's another headline. Now I want a great big splash for the first issue. Put a half million copies on the street. We can't sell that many. - I didn't say sell. Give them away. But, boss. Now don't tell me you can't give them away. Croney, look what some dumbbell left on my desk. Dumbbell? To my swell new boss from .. Croney. Well. Yeah. I felt it would be nice making a record of all he appointments you don't keep. So you don't think I knew all the time who gave it to me? No. Okay. Nice. Oh chief .. do you mind? Now Mike, we can't start this. I've advanced you a week's pay already. I know chief, but the minute I got the job she nailed me for back alimony. Now, this is the last touch. You get it? - Got it. Want to put on the inside page? Typhoon in China or gang riots sweep Chicago? Chicago. Chicago has copped all the headlines for years. What's happening here? Let's see. Gene Tunney gave a statement that radicalism must be suppressed. Another record price for a seat on the stock exchange. 222 thousand. That's dull. Ziegfeld and George White are scrapping again. Oh yes. There is another baby parade in the Bronx. Hello? Mike, it's for you. Maybe one of the dope reporters of mine got a story anyway. Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Oh. - What was it? My horse ran out of the money. What is going to happen today? What do we know that nobody else knows? What do you want to do, print tomorrow's headlines today? Well, if another war starts in the next hour I'll be over at Al's place. Get me Inspector Brody. Get me Inspector Brody please. I'll get a story. You got him? - You just told me. Remind me. I want an editorial on the phone service. Why, hello Brody. That's right. Corey. Tell me, how do you feel about law enforcement? You are in favor of it? Well, good. Now look, there's a saloon. Al's Place, running right outside my front entrance. You newspaper shark. There's nothing in the law against selling beer. Al's Place has been raided and no evidence. I can't persecute the man. There will be no raid. Well as you say, Inspector .. Only tomorrow morning at your house there will be three for breakfast. You, the missus and a certain blond from Flatbush. So help me, I don't know any blonds from any place. But I wouldn't put it past you to dig one up and send her over. Well then, go over to Al's Place and scope it out. Yeah. And or evidence have the cops grab some of Al's hair tonic. Yeah. Thank you. Well now I got a story. I don't have to wait for the raid. The paper will be on the street telling the people about it before it happens. Nolan. Doctor Corey has ordered a raid. Doctor Corey is going to get a raid. But not the raid Doctor Corey ordered. Police dry up big downtown oasis. And I thought Al was a friend of yours. He is. The poor guy has been wanting to break his lease for a long time. And Johnny, clip us nice and high at the back will you. Take plenty off the top. I want this one to last. You've got it, Mr Corey. Why can't I cover at least some sports? I don't mean children's sailboat races. No. You want to go down south for baseball training? And golf tournaments, World Series and Notre Dame games. Spend New Year's day at the Rose Bowl. What's the matter with that? - I wouldn't mind it myself. Hazel. Tell Mr Reynolds I want a follow up story on the raid across the street. Tell him give Brody a boost for his prompt action. Outstanding law enforcement and all that. Well Brody is a real friend. We'd better keep him while we have him. Yes? A flash. Just found married woman murdered in Brooklyn hideaway. Cops hold the husband for questioning. Well send Benson, Gregory and some sob sister. To cover the human interest angels. Chase four shadow men for pictures. Snap all in sight. Take somebody to play the corpse in case the real on objects. "I forgot to tell you. Danson just phoned in. He's in jail." "He wants us to bail him." - Let him stay there. Send Reynolds. "I can't chief. He's in jail too." - What? "They got picked up in a raid on Al's Place across the street." "They were our best photographers. What do we do?" I'll call you back. - "Hello?" Look here, where is our lawyer? "He's in jail, Mr Corey. He was in Al's Place and .." That settles it. Tommy, you and I will .. Where did he go? He was supposed to cover a children's sailboat race at one o'clock. But it's only twelve. What does he want, to see the Commodore get his bottle? Oh, I'll cover this myself. You come too, will you. I've got an idea. What about your haircut? - He can come back next week. Hazel. Miss Cronin and I are going out. Take all messages. Yes, sir. And tell the desk to kill that boost for Brody. He never arrested speakeasy customers before in his life. Is that alright, Mr Corey? - Wait a minute. Hold it. Croney, come on now. Pull it higher will you. This is supposed to sell papers. Come on now. Give. But I am supposed to be dead. Yeah, but the public isn't. Yeah. That will do. After the retouch department puts a dimple on it. Alright Charlie, it's all yours. They ought to have something snappier than that in their house of romance. They don't do these things so well in Brooklyn. Ready? Good. I got it. I think. Well rush them over to my office. I hope we never have to cover a trunk murder. I don't bend so easily. Well, now we can go to town on this. I always wanted to see a man bite a dog. So this is news? Murder. Scandal. Cheapness. Corpses with dimples served piping hot with bacon and eggs for 2 cents a cup. Well, just as good as broken treaties, dizzy finance or grub politics. What do you want, Croney? I don't know. I know. You've got the heebie-jeebies. This corpse business has got you down. A good hot bath is all you need. You are okay, Croney. You are a first class newspaperman. Well, do you know of a better career? A mother has had a better one. I've heard it spoke of very highly. Now don't tell me you are the domestic type, Croney. Is The Mercury against marriage too? Bruce, Where are you going from here? Still talking about ideals, huh? Well, don't worry. I've got them. There's many things crying to be done in this town. I know them. I want them just as much as you do. But you can't preach to people until you get them in church. We're helpless without a circulation. In order to get it we've got to give the public what it wants: shocks. That's the third day for that headline. It still don't mention my name, boss. - No, but it will any minute. It's a good thing for you I own that newspaper. I'll get on to Corey tonight and have him take the heat off you. Why can't you get along with women? Hope didn't understand me, boss. I'm putting the heat on that showgirl murder. This is going to be a juicy assignment for you, kid. This may sound funny to you but it is not my meat. Strong meat is our business. And vultures too. No. Let someone else dish up scandal. I don't want to write any story that half a million will forget and .. A mother and father will remember the rest of their days. I don't think any story is worth ruining a life. Yeah. I know, kid. What do you know? I don't blame you for feeling that way. Your father's name was Tom Jarrett, not Jarvis. He killed Thornton Bancroft in a row over your mother. You are very casual about it. - It is yesterday's news. Yes, and tomorrow's too. They never forget it. They never let me forget it. If I go into a nightclub or get a traffic ticket. I can't pick up a fresh edition without wondering if someone's dug it up again. Do you wonder I hate this kind of .. Journalism you love? Well, that business was a field day for the papers. They kept pound at my mother with dirty headlines until they killed her. I've kept it all locked up inside me and now even you have to. You may keep it locked up in you but it will ever be a dead weight choking you. Come on, now. Spit it out. Nobody ever won a fight by running away from it. What did you find out? In the army. When you have to put down your next of kin. You wrote "Father: Tom Jarrett". When they signed you to the paper I saw our service record. His name made me remember the trial. The first big story I ever covered. It gave me my first byline, that trial. You don't care whose face you kick on your way up the ladder. Well, I suppose not. They are mostly rungs to me. Nice ethics. Well, you know the rules as well as I do. News is news. There's been times when I've gone back to the faces I stepped on and sort of .. Try to patch them up again. Now, who could that be? Hiya, Bruce. - Hi, Lambert. Miss Fenton - Mr Corey. How do you do, Mr Corey. - How do you do, Miss Fenton. Well, this is news. The spider walks into the fly's parlor. Come right in. Excuse me. Tommy. Oh, Tommy. This is Miss Fenton. Mr Jarvis of The Mercury. - Hello. How do you do. - And Mr Lambert. Hello. - How are you? Miss Fenton is a warbler. She is anxious to break into show business, aren't you. I'm going to help her. - Naturally. Mr Lambert had me meet his best pal Jason Grant who is a producer. Well, isn't that the usual procedure? And don't you own a piece of the show? Yeah. How did you know? Well, I always think of you as a patron of the arts. Have a drink? - Thanks. I don't drink. Where could you and I talk? Right in here. Oh, Tommy. Entertain the lovely lady. She'll have plenty of that tonight. We're on our way to a party. Okay, then just sit and stare at each other. I am sorry to be so preoccupied but I .. Headache? Yeah, something like that. Sorry. Please don't take Mr Corey seriously. I don't want to be entertained. I'm willing to sit and stare if you are. Have you read ..? - Have you seen ..? You know, I enjoy talking to a girl like you. Really? Well, these figures look pretty good to me. Is it alright if the silent partner says "attaboy"? Well, there is nothing like harmony between partners. That's the beauty of each one having his own job. Yours is silence and mine is noise. Well, if I made any criticism. I would say there is a tendency on your part to .. Overplay your story. And some of them are getting pretty tiresome. Indeed? Which one? - Take today for example. That .. "Who killed Hope" or whatever her name is. Mind you, I'm not talking as a partner now, just a reader. I'm getting awfully tired of showgirl murders. There is always something new happening in the world. Let's have the new, not the old. You are right. Absolutely right. What we need is a new angle. And I have got it. Well, what is your angle? We'll offer a reward for the whereabouts of her boyfriend. Georgie Pelotti. So that's your angle. - Sure. What is yours? You are not mentioning any names. Not in my paper. - Our paper. All I'm going to say is that the police might want to see him for questioning. We're not running a private police department. Besides, the cops are not looking for Georgie Pelotti. Well, they will read The Mercury. Ah, he is alibied a mile high. - Then he's got nothing to worry about. Listen, genius. Georgie Pelotti is an associate of mine. Well, maybe you ought to be more choosy, Lambert. I figure you for a pretty smart guy, Corey. Don't play with dynamite. You know what I mean? Sure. I know what you mean. Why tire yourself out here? We just started. Through with your conference? Oh yes, we make them short and sweet. Hope you have a good time at the party. It is too bad you're newspapermen or Mr Lambert might have got you invited. What sort of a party is it? It's just another one of Jason Grant's backstage get-togethers after the show. Well, if I resign from the paper can I go? The press is barred, huh? No, not barred. Just not invited. Goodnight. Come along Gail. Goodbye. - Goodnight. Bye. - Goodbye. A backstage party? Newspapermen stay away. Well, what do you think of that? Quite a party. - What you can see of it. Yeah. Some of our best people at their worst. It's a great party, isn't it. - Yes. Would you like to dance? - Love to. Excuse us? - Sure. Have a good time. Hey, waiter. How about another drink up here? Waiter. Gail, wait for me on the stage. I'll be right back. Have a look at that young chap sitting at the table over there. The boy wonder of Wall Street. He made two millions last week. Where? The one with the two girls. - One for each million. Oh and there is really Mr Big. His great, great grandfather trapped furs. He gives them away. I'll circulate round and see who else is here. You sneak up on the stage and cover the sporting events there. The guest list would read like a social register. Or maybe a police blotter. What do you mean sitting up here making a fool of yourself? It's just the party spirit, boss. Listen to this Mr Social Butterfly. Don't be too happy. Or Bruce Corey will wipe that smile right off your face. I thought you were telling him tonight. - I did but I didn't like the answers. Just get out of town and stay there until you hear from me. But boss .. - Come on. Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? - Came all the way to finish our dance. This is ours, isn't it? Sorry, it's taken. I get it. Maybe it's none of my business but .. What on earth is a girl like you doing running around with a man like Lambert? I have my reasons. I told you, he is helping me get a job. Oh, a career woman, huh. What's the matter with that? Careers run in our family. Though I don't know that dad would love this sort of one for me. I can't say as I blame him. Don't be stuffy. Dad used to be quite a well-known concert and opera singer. That's why. Clyde Fenton. Ever heard of him? Nobody has lately. I have now, now. If anyone ever says to me again have I heard of Clyde Fenton .. I'll say, yes sir, I certainly have. Every heard of Clyde Fenton? I've heard of Gail Fenton. The loveliest, wonderful-est .. - I'll have to have you meet my dad. I warn you. He is old-fashioned. Well, I'd better not tell him I'm a tabloid reporter. Don't worry, I won't. We're not as bad as all that you know. It is romantic but not respectable. Couldn't you be something else? I could be beggar. I could be king. I could be almost .. anybody. It all depends on you. Lambert. A friend of yours was here just a minute ago. Did you ask anybody? I know you're a man of discretion and all, but .. A friend of mine? No. A friend, eh? I know who he is. And as long as he is my guest tonight I'd like to take care of him. It's alright as long as you know who he is. You have heard of him too. Bruce Corey of The Mercury. What? A newspaper man here? - Yeah. And I don't want to miss him. Turn up your house lights for a minute. - I can't do that. You'd be seeing him but he'd be seeing things too. That he shouldn't. Why don't we sweat the kind, boss? - Don't worry for the kid. I want Corey. Looking for me? How did you get in here? - It's easy when you know how. Maybe you didn't understand. But I think I told you that newspapermen aren't wanted. Well, I am a problem child, Lambert. You are no problem to me. Don't print anything about this party or Georgie Pelotti or anything about me. That leaves us the funny pages and the crossword puzzles. That's up to you. I don't want this party in. What people want to get in to the newspapers is advertising. What they want to keep out is news. When I tell you not to print anything you don't print it. I hope you know now what I mean. What did he say? Don't worry. He won't print any of it. - Fine, fine. Look Mike, I want you to get all the names in. People caught at the raid. But give Georgie Pelotti the big splash. I want pictures of chorus girls being carried out. Kicking to resist arrest. Yep. I'll get some cameramen over there right away. No, we haven't time for photographers here. We'll keep them there. Just pose our good-looking secretaries and give me plenty of art. Sure. The scantier the better. Now stop asking silly questions. Get me police headquarters. Oh hello. Got a nickel? I want to phone my mother. Well that's a good girl. Kinda late to be phoning your mother. But she never gets in until this time. Oh. Here. Thank you very much. Not at all. Brody speaking. Oh, it's you. Another tip? That's Jim Dandy. Well, the reason I tip you is .. It wouldn't be artistic if your feet got any flatter by pounding the Bronx again. Alright then, I'll call the Prohibition Department so the Feds get the credit. Well, why not? It's their law. Well, my paper thinks you ought to talk to Pelotti about the Hope killing case. Yes, he is among those gloriously present. Now, the department was just thinking we might want to talk to that guy Pelotti. Alright, alright you scavenger. Maybe we'll have to bust in on that little party. Boys and girls. Our new candidate for fame. Miss Gail Fenton. She is joining our show next week. And she is going to sing her letter of recommendation. "After you've gone and left me crying." "After you've gone there is no denying." "You'll feel blue and you'll feel sad." "You will miss the dearest friend you ever had." "There will come a time, don't you forget it." "There will come a time when you will regret it." "Oh baby, look what you are doing." "You know my love for you is driving, driving me to ruin." "After you have gone." "After you have gone away." "After I'm gone." "After we break up." "After I'm gone you are going to wake up." "You will find that you were blind." Come on Tommy. Let's get out of here. "Change your mind all through the years." "We've been together." "Through joy and tears, all kinds of weather." "Or maybe, you'll look what you're doing." "You know my love for you is driving, driving me to ruin." "After you have gone, after you have gone away." Extra! Read all about the big raid. Extra! Extra! Read all about the big raid. Extra! Here, son. Extra! Read all about the big raid. Well, how do you like that? Here I'm reading about that raid in the paper and they are just pulling it. What paper is that? "The New York Mercury." "News before it happens." Boy, what a paper. The old-line papers haven't been scooped like this since Columbus landed. How'd you catch on to this orgy anyway? - Oh, it's easy when you know how. We just put another 20,000 copies on the street. Greg. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. How do you do, ma'am. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Right. Any time. Goodbye. That was the Woman's League for a better New York. They want to give us a plaque for our superb work in exposing vice. We'll take it. What you got there? Just a modest little item we missed. I thought you'd be interested. The Sentinel has half a column on it. - Go on, spill it. "Among those caught in the raid and later released .." "Was a reporter for the New York Mercury using the name of Thomas Jarvis." "Who was revealed to be the son of Tom Jarrett." "The focus of a sensational murder that rocked New York early this century." "Jarrett shot and killed Thornton Bancroft." "The world-famous artist at a table at a well-known caf?." Etc. Etc. Where is Tommy? I don't think he'll be coming around here anymore. What? Going places, huh? I was hoping we'd skip the farewells. I'm not cut out to be a newspaperman. Not only I can't it. I can't dish it out. Well, what are you going to do when you get to this .. Where are you going anyway? I'm going to get away from paved streets and daily newspapers. I'll get off the end of some single-track railroad and .. Start walking. And sleep in haylofts and collect bird's eggs? I know you like to be tough where it matters, kid. But steel only comes out of a fiery furnace. Set them up in some other alley, teacher. Do you mind? I'm leaving tonight. Well, those witches and bogeymen in your head will go right along with you. To the end of the track and further. Look, can't you see? I'm fighting this with you for your own good. Sure, Bruce. Sure. It's no use. I tried it your way. It doesn't work. I've got to do it mine. Just when I met a girl who .. Who really hit me too. [ Telephone ] Yeah? Yeah, Mike. Your pal Lambert phoned. He'll be charmed to see you in Pauley's soon. He's waiting at his usual table. I'll drop in there tonight. He'll wait. Lambert wants to see me. This is going to be the showdown. Going alone? Certainly. So long, kid. When did you say you were leaving? After we've seen Lambert. Hello Jimmy. - Hello, Mr Lambert. Jimmy, I want to work that gag on another friend of mine tonight. I got you. Mugsy here will point out my friend when he comes in for the card. And you sell him these. You see? And you keep the money. Thanks a lot, Mr Lambert. I hope you get a laugh out of fit. Well, laughs make the world go around, don't they. That's right. Come on. Hello, Mr Corey. - Fine, Henry. There he is. Hiya, Lambert. Sit down. - Thanks. Hello, kid. You know, I'm plenty annoyed with you. Remind me to stay awake at night and worry about it. Look, ambitious. I am through with any guy that doesn't take orders from me. Especially a partner. When are you quitting, Lambert? A hundred grand for one share of your stock. Which would give you control. You and I are going to settle this here. You are not going to double-cross me again. That story about the raid may have been poison to you. But it was an agreeable experience for me. And the public. Civic organizations are striking medals with my picture on them. Oh yeah? Heads or tails? Well, people are beginning to go strong for The Mercury. Today, just an illegitimate child of the press but .. Someday it will be a great power for good. For my good? If I could swing the money. I'd buy that one share from you. Maybe you can swing it without the money. Want to try your luck? There isn't a gambling game in town that doesn't give you the edge. You read that somewhere. - I wrote it. Go on. You are too smart to believe everything you write. I'll give you an even break. - At what? High poker. For that share of stock. With whose cards? Whose cards? Oh .. We can get him to go next door and get a deck. They sell cards next door? - Yeah. It's a drugstore. - Oh. Pick up a deck of cards, will you. See that the seal is unbroken, Tommy. Long distance, Mr Lambert. Right out here. Hello? Merrill? This is Eddie in Miami. Listen, Merrill. I'm in a tough spot. I got to have five thousand right off. Tonight. I can't hear you. I need five grand right away. I've got to have it. I'll pay you back Saturday. Sure. It must be a bad connection. I can't hear a word you say. This is long distance. I don't know why you can't hear him, Mr Lambert. I can hear him perfectly. Then you give it to him. Draw for deal? Yep. My deal. Five card draw. Buy as many cards as you like. Alright. Cut. Before you buy any cards you wouldn't want to up the bet a bit, would you? I might. Alright. I'll play you for the complete ownership of the paper. You have got a bet. Alright. Cards? Four. Did you say four? Yeah. What is the matter? Oh, nothing. Nothing. Not much strength then? I will tell you in a minute. I want four and off the top please. You think I've given you a fair shuffle? No. I'm playing a hunch .. That the next four cards would make your hand better than my full house. I think you would finish with four of a kind. Easy when you know how, isn't it. You read that somewhere too. Alright. If you think you're not getting a .. A square shake. We'll call the whole thing off. But we are still partners. Yes, but just as before. There are no punches pulled. No holds barred. Come on Tommy. You see. It's true what they say. You meet such interesting people in the newspaper business. Hello. - Hello. I've been wanting to see you. I've got to talk to you. I have got a date. Well, couldn't you please break it? I'm leaving tonight. I can't. Who is it, Lambert? Yeah. Got any objections? Yes, I will talk to her for a second. - No you are not, newsboy. You hard what Mr Lambert said. Sell your papers. Sell my papers? I'll show her. From the end of the railroad track? - That can wait. I've got a New York assignment to cover first. Now you are talking. I'm glad you still own the paper. What if you had lost? Well, haven't they got room for two in those hobo camps? Lambert's calling-card. You're not going to let him get away with this, are you? Well, if you are I'm not. Bruce, you wanted me back on the paper didn't you. Well, you've got me back. I'll work for nothing to get that guy. You wouldn't stand a chance personally or professionally. If you think it's too hot for you, why not turn Brody loose on him? It's no use being a cry-baby in this business. Besides, this is a little matter between two partners. And you know how partners can fight. But you now plenty about his gambling debts. That's an angle. It's no use exposing his gambling. Everybody in New York gambles. The stock market boom has driven people crazy. Where his other rackets are concerned, he has somebody else fronting for him. He has got his name on that insurance business though. You think Lambert's insurance business is crooked? Anything he runs is crooked. If I could get the names of some of his policyholders. No. "Yeah?" Hazel, get me a permit to carry a gun. Bruce. Don't you ever read this? No need. I never forget an appointment. Well, there's a man outside who thinks differently. He's been waiting nearly two hours. - Who is it? Name of Molyneaux. - Molyneaux? The flier! Of course. Yes. Well, shall I send him in? - Yes. But first I must see Reynolds. Yeah? Mike, have you got the headline proof? - Yeah. Let's see it. "Mercury plane will hop sea." Alright, we'll make this our lead story. This "flying the Atlantic" act has got people sitting up nights. I'm going to cash in on it. Say The Mercury has quietly planned to back a non-stop transatlantic flight. In the interest of aviation and patriotism. Say that The Mercury has been withholding news of it. But now that the pond itself has been flown .. We are flying further. To Koblenz. To lay a copy of The Mercury on the tomb of the Daily Doughboy. Hey, this is juicy. When did you arrange it? I haven't yet but I am going to right now. Monsieur Molyneaux. - Bonjour. I understand from some friends of mine at Rosemont Field that you are quite .. Anxious to make a transatlantic flight. - It is the ambition of my life. My plane is the "Jeanne D'Arc". - Your plane is the "Spirit Of Mercury". No, my plane is the Jeanne D'Arc. It was but it is going to be the Spirit of Mercury. Tell me, how soon can you take off? You know there are many things. - You let me worry about those. Now, are you fitted with a wireless? - No. We'll get that attended to right away. - Good. All around the world I can tell the world of "Molyneaux". I shall be a great man again. Medals and statues. You know, this is my destiny. My salut ? la gloire. How wonderful. Salute to gloire? Salut ? la gloire. - Oh yes. See that Mr Molyneaux is properly quoted in tomorrow's paper. Now, I will send one of our men along with you. Now you tell the world of every breathless minute of this epic flight. Every thrilling moment will be chronicled. The take-off. - Yes. The anxiety. - Yes. The suffering. - Yes. No. You're going to be cold and hungry, aren't you? No. - Yes you will. Then the .. the ultimate victory. As the plane swoops down in Koblenz. Koblenz. Yah. Marvellous. - Magnifique, yes? Extraordinaire, huh? Give me all the art you can, will you. Pictures of the plane and of .. - Of me? Yes, of course. Of everything. Well, Mr Molyneaux. We are partners in a glorious adventure. Aventure de la gloire. Oh yes, all of that stuff. I'd have a drink with you on it but it so happens I am very busy at the moment. Take him over to Al's Place. No, you can't do that. That's closed. Thank you. Au revoir. - Au revoir. The spirit of .. The Mercury. Mercury. Yes. Well, that's going to be quite an assignment. "Yes?" - Send Tommy Jarvis in. "He went out about five minutes ago. In a hurry." Hello, Joe. - You found your keys, eh? What are you talking about? Well, you told me you lost them. I didn't lose any keys. You told me over the phone you lost them. And to let Mr Kelly in. I told you to let somebody in my office? - A half hour ago. After I talked to you he came right over. He is up there now. Take us upstairs. Get him! Wait. Where you going? - The stairs. Nah, you can't get him now. Let him go. Isn't he the man you sent over? What did he look like? - I can tell exactly. I got a good look at him. He's about 5 foot 11. Blond. Young. Say, you do know him, don't you? Oh sure, we were just playing a little gag on him, that's all. Have a cigar, Pop. And just forget about it. Come in here. Get on that phone. Put men round the Mercury building. Stop that kid before he gets to his office. Better get Louis. - What about Louis, boss? That Fenton file! It's gone. Get up to Fenton's apartment. I think you'll find the kid there. And bed him down in the nest for good. Hello. Mr Fenton? - Yes. I am Tom Jarvis of The Mercury. Maybe Gail has mentioned me? Yes, but .. She is asleep. This is hardly the hour. I shan't wake her, sir. It is you I've got to see. It is about Merrill Lambert. Come in. Well? What about Lambert? Look, Mr Fenton. You gave Lambert an IOU for fifty thousand dollars. You took out a life insurance policy with him to cover it. How do you know? I have got it. Recognise this? Let me see that. - No, we are going to need it. Our paper is out to get Lambert. You mustn't use my name. You can't .. You lost that money to him gambling. He is crooked, Mr Fenton. It is against the law to coerce. - No. No. Gail assigned it to him. I've got an idea of the pressure he used. It is your duty as a citizen to help us expose him. That's easy enough for you to say. All you want is a story to print and then you can forget about it. My daughter and I will have to live with scandal. It crushes you as long as you are afraid of it. Face it. It's your only chance to be free. What's he been saying to you, dad? He has that note of mine and policy. Why did you have to spoil everything? I had it all settled with Lambert. He wasn't going to press dad for the money. You .. Had it all settled with Lambert? Yes, dad. I have .. I've been seeing him. Going out with him. I had to get that note and policy. It isn't quite that tragic, dad. Young man. Tell your paper .. I will swear to everything I know about Lambert's insurance business. You do that and it is curtains for him. But dad, maybe you shouldn't. - Don't worry. Goodnight, dear. Really, it's a load off my mind. Goodnight, young man. - Goodnight, sir. So long, Gail. Tommy. How did you get those papers? I swiped them. Tommy. I thought you were going away tonight. Bruce persuaded me to stay. Oh. Maybe it wasn't Bruce after all. Oh? You made me mad. Oh, indeed? Why didn't you tell me what you were up to with Lambert? I'd have helped you. Anyone out of knee-pads could see that I was acting when I saw you tonight. Anyone out of kindergarten could see it was a dangerous way to save your father. I've got to get back to the office. Can I kiss you? No. Well, alright. Well, why don't you if you want to? What? Kiss me. What? You said that I .. There. There. What's this? Your bottle. It is midnight. Onion soup. I get it. Croney. How is it you always know my favorites? I guess because I like so many of them myself. Anybody would like this. Remind me to drop the Greek a note and compliment him. He must have some new recipes. Yes. I gave him some of my mother's. Hmm. Boy, this isn't soup. This is a creation. Croney, I've heard tell of girls like you. Oh, your hearing has always been sharp enough. But you don't see them. Actually meet them. Girls like me. You don't know them. What's got into you? I've been going to quit over a hundred times. But .. You wouldn't even know my phone number. Mr Corey's office. Just a moment please. Tommy. Say, where you been since ..? Bruce, I've got terrific news. Gail and I have made up. That was set with me. I knew that would happen. And another thing. I just broke into Lambert's office and went through his files. Boy, have I got the dope on him. I've got a note and policy signed by Clyde Fenton. You fool you! You might just as well start writing your own obituary. Where are you? Get in here. I am at Gail's. You'd have laughed. They took a pot-shot at me and missed me by a mile. You would feel so elated if you get down here and find you're fired, would you? Fired? For what? I run this paper, not you. I hand out assignments. Reporters don't pick them. If you don't like it, get off the ship. Well, I understood I had the assignment. I thought that .. I never said that. Now hustle down here. What's the phone number there? I'm going to check back on you. Take a note and have the cashier give Tommy a 250 dollar bonus. Tommy. Downtown. Yes, sir. Don't worry. Newspaper men are the most unreliable people in the world. Especially when they have an assignment. And he's on an important one. He'll turn up. - I don't believe it. It is time we did something. Not just stand still. Chief, Ramsay MacDonald is making a new speech before the League of Nations .. About reducing the navies. What do you want to do with it? Put it on the front page! Play it up big. Don't you know a feature story when you see one? Of course, don't want it on the front page. Put a squib on the back somewhere. Who cares what they are talking about in Geneva. I got him. I don't know where he's talking from but they connected me. I had to make a date with the bartender at Pauley's to get him. Hello, Lambert. Yeah, Corey. I don't know. I just had a hunch you would be there. That's funny, I had a hunch too. I've just won myself a mental bet. I bet myself 10-1 for a lot of money that you would telephone me. And I very seldom lose a bet. What's on your mind, Corey? Well, I want to claim a horse. A two-year-old. And I thought you would be the person to tell me how to go about it. No. I haven't anything more important to do. Yeah, I could be right over. Okay, outside of Pauley's? I'll be right over. So I want to thank you again, Mr Corey. The missus had a grand sleep last night. That bottle of Scotch you sent was good medicine. I wasn't sure she drank. - She don't. But I do. - Mr Corey! I want to talk to you. Excuse me, Pat. Please don't go. We can call the police. Inspector Brody would do anything for you. Why you silly kid. Call Brody for what? I know where you are going and .. I am frightened. Come over here. Now sit down a minute. Croney. For a long time you've done something to me that I was going to tell you to stop. Now I have changed my mind. I'm going to let you keep on looking after me. Well, somebody has to look after you. And see that you get your meals. There, now you are starting to ruin your make up. I'm sorry. I'll stop being so silly. Now don't you do it, Croney. You keep right on being silly. I like it. You do? Yeah, but I am going to put a stop to you being an office wife. It's time we both settled down and I don't why we can't do it together. Now, what is tomorrow? - Thursday. You can take the day off and get some of your things together? - Yes. Alright. Tomorrow we grab a train for the Adirondacks. You mean elope? Yeah. But I warn you, I will be one of those cup-of-coffee, kiss-and-run guys. I don't care. - Then it's all set. We'll stop off at the city hall on our way to the station. His Honor can marry us. And Tommy can be best man. Now don't you worry. I will see you in church. Hey. You Corey? - Yeah. Come on. Don't turn around. Hello Jerry. How's tricks? Got any new ones? Just a new one. Step inside. You haven't got your boyfriend in the back seat this time. Do I get to see your boss? Yeah. Sure. Corey is here. Come in. Looks like you had a profitable night. Even without the ransom money. - Sit down. You have got the kid haven't you? I wanted these returned. A note and a policy from one of my clients. Alright. Now you have got him I suppose I will be seeing Tommy as usual. That depends. What's it going to cost me? - Your newspaper. Here is a transfer turning over all your stock to me. Of course our transaction will be for cash. You are just selling, see. I see it is dated back to the time of your original agreement. Very business-like. - That's it. What if I say no? You wouldn't let the kid down like that. He saved your life once, remember? Well, if I do turn over the paper to you how do I know I'd get him back alive? In a couple of minutes I expect a telephone call. All I've got to say is: turn the kid loose. That is, if you sign. What if I don't? They'll never see him again. Neither will anybody else. And if I do? Tommy walks out a free man and I go home? Safely and comfortably escorted by our good friend Jerry? Your imagination is running away with you. If I had anything like that in mind I wouldn't need Jerry. What's that? Just a souvenir from a .38. Like yours. There are a lot of .38s. You want that paper more than just to get me. Why? Because you opened my eyes as to what I can do with a newspaper. Our paper takes a lot of owning. And even if you were capable of running one .. You'd never get such power in your hands through me. The trouble is you are sentimental about that paper and I am not. And as for my capabilities as a newspaperman. Well, anything can be bought for dough. No, no Lambert. It won't work. I will ease out your staff one at a time. I've got patience. Only suckers can't wait. When I'm ready .. I'll put in a few plugs for Merrill Lambert where they'll do the most good. It might be on the sports page or the financial page or the political column. Kind-of calling-cards at first. Because I might want to go very, very far. Yeah, I am .. Familiar with your calling-cards. Come on. Sign, will you. I can't do that, Lambert. I can't sign you the right to run a paper. The people do that. They grant you the licence to tell them what is going on all over the world. Who was born today, who is dead, who succeeded, who failed. What new laws are made, what laws are broken. If there will be war or peace. The what, who, why, where and how of everything. I will remember that molasses for an election speech. [ Telephone ] There it is. Well, here is another thing you can remember. The licence the readers give you is renewable every day. And they don't grant that licence to a rat like you. [ Telephone ] Is that kid going to be turned loose? [ Telephone ] Yeah. Fine. Then sign first. Yeah. But first, this belongs to you. Here, catch it. [ 2x gunshots! ] Put 'em up! Get over to that phone. Come on. Come on. Just say it's okay. Turn the kid loose. Don't make any mistakes. Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry. It's okay. Turn the kid loose. Now turn around. Face the wall. And as for you, my young man. - Mr Corey. Don't shoot. I won't talk. They'll never get a word out of me. Why should I? What's the percentage in sticking my neck out for them? I know, you have quite a collection. Where you been? I got it in time for a re-plate on the home edition. We beat the town. When they let him go Tommy phoned in. I had him stall the police for an hour. What did he tell them? He told me to tell you that he wasn't going to be able to identify his host. He said something about you can't be a cry-baby in this business. Why don't you let me in on some of these stunts? Well, maybe we'll make a reporter of him yet, Mike. Oh sure. I almost forgot. Congratulations, cupid. So your bachelor days are over, huh? Croney told you? Told me? She wanted me to get out an extra: "Corey loves Croney". Anything come in on the wires lately? Nah. The town must have been dead last night. Look at how peaceful the streets are. Those buildings. Full of secrets. Something must have happened in them. Someone got kissed or got socked. Oh, shut up. - What? Well, I just mean that I'd give my back alimony for a final headline. That's it. What about the other papers? Nothing, The Central is playing up the predictions of some financial bug. "The sky is the limit for Wall Street" says expert. That will help sell papers. People like to hear that. But they also ran an editorial warning readers not to pay any attention to him. That the stock market is just a gamble. Here, I will take that. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Well, here is your headline. It's Smitty phoning in from police. What? Yeah. Hold it a minute, will you. Here is Reynolds. Give it to him. - What is it? Merrill Lambert was shot and killed tonight. What? You pull headlines right out of the sky. It's easy when you know how. Here, you answer it. I'll get some sleep. Sleep? Merrill Lambert killed and you talk about sleep? Give it to me, Smitty. Yeah. Yeah. Go on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Go on. You know they say it is bad luck .. For a man to be seeing his bride before the ceremony on the wedding day. But I don't believe it. Do you? No, I don't. Are you sure you won't have some coffee? No thanks. If I'd just known you were coming by I could have fixed some eggs. Croney. Yes? You know .. It's a funny thing. All my life I have made a living out of words but .. Now I can't find the right ones. I know what I mean. That jewellery reminded me. When I was a kid I raided my mother's pantry once and she gave me a slap. She wore .. A big old-fashioned ring and it cut me. She was scared. It didn't bother me but I made her believe she'd hurt me. Later on, when she was dying. All I wanted to tell her was that she didn't hurt me. But she couldn't hear me. If you get .. get what I mean. Croney. Why is it that people don't say things to people they love until it's too late? You are in trouble? Aren't we going to be married? You want to tell me why? Last night I shot and killed Merrill Lambert. Did you hear what I said? What are we going to do? We? You are out of this. It is mine. Exclusive. But .. We have to fight this out together. There isn't anything to fight. I killed a man. I am going back to the office. I have got a lot of things to do. Bruce! Oh, Bruce. I am so afraid. Yep. Got it, Mike? - Got it. Don't worry about the paper. I'll do everything you told me to. Just go along and have a good time. Well, I may want to stay away a little longer than I planned. I know how it is. My three honeymoons were the three happiest times of my life. Say Mike, these IOUs of yours. Do you know that you have drawn four weeks salary ahead? Now, what will do for eating this month? Stop it, I guess. Oh, I get it. A little wedding present from you and Croney, huh? Oh. Just one more thing, chief. I didn't want to worry you about it tonight. So I told that flyer of ours not to be in any hurry about that take off. I guess we don't need that stunt to sell papers now. No, That Lambert killing is hotter than a firecracker. You and Croney sure picked a swell time to go off honeymooning. With a story like this one breaking. Yes. I didn't pick such a good time, did I. Do you know where Roosevelt Field is? Roosevelt Field? - Yeah. You know. Over the bridge on Long Island. - Yes, sir. Kinda foggy over the bridge tonight. What are you going to do? Tell them all I'm on a new assignment. Bruce, you are running away. Somewhere I am. You've brought your notebook, haven't you? Yes. - Good. To Inspector Brody. Dear Pat. I haven't called him that in years. I killed Merrill Lambert. When I come back we'll get a lawyer and we'll have them go crazy. Trying to save my hide by arguing that I did it for the good of New York. Put it down, won't you. This tabloid age we are living in is coming to an end. I think New Yorkers will be better off without men like Merrill Lambert. But until I return. We'll keep the motive as a little joke between you and me. And Croney. A "Good luck, Pat" and goodbye. Anything else? Yes. Have Tommy give the Fenton note and the policy to the district attorney. Have him explain that racket. And get Lambert's policies .. And give them back to the people that he terrorised into taking them out. You hand them our personally, Croney. You will find them from the Battery to the Bronx. In tenements and penthouses. Now you give each of those policies back to its owner. Everything all set go, Molyneaux? - Hmm. I don't understand. First, I get a telephone message from Mr Reynolds that the flight's postponed. Then you telephone that I am to go at once. Well, at once it is. The money has been deposited according to your instructions. Now if anything happens and we hope it won't. The bank will forward the draft to France. But it is not what I planned. I have many friends who wish to come down and cheer. How can I disappoint them? How can I explain? You have a wireless, right? You can tell your public anything you want. Very well, Monsieur. I am ready. The ship is ready. We wait only on weather reports. When you get them let me know. I'll be in that cab over there. Fine. It won't be long now, Croney. Oh Bruce, please don't go. Stay and fight. You just said, now it was either your life or Lambert's. We can get the best lawyer in the country. Well of course we can. I might get acquitted, but will the Mercury? I told Lambert he can't run the Mercury because the public wouldn't accept him. I told him he was vulnerable as the devil. Well, I am too now, Croney. - No. Now the important thing is for the paper to go on. Now you run it, you and Tommy. I've arranged it for you both. Oh, and .. Don't fire Reynolds. He can't afford it. You know, you are aces, Croney. You've given me the one thrill in the world I've never had. That of a woman crying over me. From the heart. But whatever happens, this makes it worth it. Mr Corey. Molyneaux is ready. He wants to know if the reporter is here. Yes, he is. Well, so long, Croney. Don't forget to phone Reynolds the minute we are off. We'll scoop the town. Wait. Here is that .. The handkerchief you loaned me the other night in the lobby when .. We were making such swell plans. Don't you want to keep it? I guess I had better. You know, a nice thing about tears. They all call come out in the wash. Let her go Molyneaux. I'll join you on that salute to glory. Fine. "Navy." "Locates." "Lost." "Plane." "Spirit." "Of Mercury." "Pilot." "Safe." "Editor." "Lost." "As." "New." "Storm." "Sweeps Atlantic." "Navy." "Quits." "Further." "Search for him." "Molyneaux." "The pilot." "Said he saw him." "Go down with his own eyes." "He says." "If he had only." "Hung on." "Five." "Minutes." "Longer." We both loved him, Croney. What a great guy he was. Tough outside but .. Inside all heart. You know, he was sore at me for going on that Lambert story. Only because it was dangerous. That's why he went on the flight. Too risky to send anyone else. I should have known he would go himself. Was there any way we could stop him? I tried. A newspaperman to the end. He kept sending until the radio failed. He even wrote his last headline himself. I don't want to be selfish, Croney. That ride down to the field. Rightly belonged just to you but .. I'd like to know about it. What did he say? What did he talk about? 0h. Mostly about the future of the paper. He wants you and me to carry on. Get behind the desk, Tommy. We have a job to do. Go ahead. He said that .. That if anything happened to him. You were to be the man of the family. Get going, Tommy. "Mike Reynolds." - Start 'em rolling, Mike. Pictures of Bruce and Molyneaux on the front page. A full page layout. And Mike. For our center spread .. Let's have a map of the Atlantic with an X to show where the plane went down. And statements from aviation experts .. That though the flight was unsuccessful the cause of aviation has been advanced. Lead page two with Bruce's own story. The one he radioed in. From take-off to crash. - Mike. We will want an editorial about Bruce. Not a weepy one. Just say that. That he was born for the tabloid age and .. That the era he lived in has come to an end. You are a good newspaperman, Croney. It's easy when you know how. -(s-d)-
