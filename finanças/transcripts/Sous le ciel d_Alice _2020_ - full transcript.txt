SKIES OF LEBANON Beirut, 24th March 1977, Dear Joseph, I'm writing just before I leave. I will probably post this letter when I arrive in Switzerland. As such, we will travel together in a way and it might be less painful for me to go back to my homeland, which I had been so happy to leave. Dinner time! I'm coming. Thank you. Dear Miss Delaloye, please find below a job offer in a commendable family. The Wyden family in Fribourg. Dear Miss Delaloye... The Gibran family? In Beirut! Welcome to Lebanon! Do you need directions? Yes. So... Gibran. Achrafieh. Follow me! - Welcome, Alice! - Welcome, Alice! Hello. Hello, Miss. Coffee? Yes. Thank you. I beg your pardon. I'm sorry, I don't understand Arabic. Excuse me. - Can I borrow the sugar? - Yes. Joseph Kamar, pleased to meet you. Alice Delaloye, pleased to meet you. You don't speak any Arabic? For your first Arabic lesson, we will study the vocabulary of this poem I found. - Does that suit you? - Yes. In this country, that has its own stars, Never have I seen such a beautiful one The Swiss star has no equal on Earth In a dull sky, A glowing star Your light overwhelmed me I want to travel with you the path That leads to the heavens And walk hand in hand, night and day That sounds beautiful. What is it about exactly? It's called "The Beauty of Lebanon's Cedars". It's a poem about nature. Here you can see Orion's nebula. And that's the great Andromeda Galaxy. I can't find Switzerland however. What will you do after you've finished your work? Are you going to go back to your country? It's hard to explain but... I don't feel that I belong there. I might travel around the area if I don't find any reason to stay here. What about you? - Don't you dream of traveling? - Yes. But not on Earth. You'll think I'm making fun of you. At university, with my colleagues, I'm working on a rocket project. Research has just begun. I hope to send the first Lebanese person in space. Do you think it's eccentric? No, on the contrary! I understand very well. - Your rocket... - Yes? When it will be ready, will you invite me to the launch? Yes. Yes, he has a good job. He's a professor. We speak French. No, I don't need to. I won't come home for anything in the world. Mimi, let me introduce you to Alice, my fiancée. Mimi, my little sister. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Caution! A Swiss person has been signalled in the area! - And so it's true! There she is! - Georges, stop it! - Hello. - Welcome, Alice. - My brother Georges. - Welcome to the family. Thank you. Amal, my sister-in-law. Nice to meet you. Unbelievable! You look like a doll! Congratulations! She is stunning. How do you find Beirut? Isn't it wonderful! I'm so happy about your wedding. Come to our house, we'll deal with the preparations. - Won't we, Mimi? - Of course! As God says, the most beautiful thing in life is love. I now declare you husband and wife, for eternity. Happy birthday! Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. Bravo! From now on, there's no doubt about it, the entire world is wondering, "When will a Lebanese person walk on the Moon?" - Madam. - The artist. - Wonderful work. - Thank you. - Hello, Mum. - Hello! Selim Bouzeid, my son. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Those two make a lovely couple. Show me your ring. - Beautiful! - It was my mother's. Beautiful. What's so funny? Tony, when will you propose to Mimi? Alice is right. Congratulations, son! Joseph, say something! She's your sister. It's your turn, Mimi! It's your turn! Congratulations, Mona! Congratulations. You two are beautiful. Stunning! Come on, son. Put them here. Stop annoying them with endless compliments. Politicians are disappointed: US Secretary of State Kissinger will end his tour of the Middle East without stopping in Lebanon. Other news on Sunday 13th April 1975, it was an eventful day in Lebanon. This morning, a car opened fire on the crowd. This afternoon, in reprisal, a bus was gunned down in Ain el-Remmaneh, in the southern suburb, causing the death of about thirty civilians. - What's going on? - Don't worry. It's far away. Officially, this is the second round of the unrest upsetting our country In the last few days, street fights have multiplied around Beirut. Last night, around forty people were killed by gunfire. To the general surprise, the third round has begun. The city centre has been spared. But fights in sensitive neighbourhoods have now turned into blind and arbitrary bombings. Luckily, the creation of the new government should confirm the summer truce which everyone hopes for. I would make it a bit bigger. It's tiny. You're jealous. Are you sure you don't want to stay longer with us? - Just a few days. - We must go home. For once Georges isn't in Dubai! Mona must study for her exam at the music academy. She seems happy here. Come and eat! - Finally! - Come, come. I'm starving. Come on, you lovebirds. My wife's feast! That's why I married her! - For the beans, Georges? - Especially the beans! We left too late. We'll miss the beginning of The Accursed Kings The National Committee for Dialogue created by the government after this spring's unrest will meet tomorrow. - My earring! - For the occasion... - Have you lost it? - I hope not. The Prime Minister said he was optimistic, 50.01%... It's going to start! Despite... - Aren't they pretty? - You're pretty. Thanks. Mum! Stop it! You'll damage the TV! Won't you sit with us? Hey you! - What? - Why the big mouth? Are you saying I've got a big mouth? Ladies and gentlemen, the exam will begin. We will start with Miss... Mona Kamar. She's going to play Waltz 15 opus 39 by Brahms. Lebanon, my little country, Lebanon, they are killing you I want to wake you Before the world collapses, Before the great cedars End in pools of blood For the scent of jasmine Never to disappear Making us forget Who we are Lebanon, my little country Lebanon My darling country Don't take up arms Your soil wouldn't stand it It stands only for our unity, Our pride and our revolution Yes, Miss, it was original. But you can't adapt the piece as you please. Do you understand? Come on! Try again next year. Don't listen to him, he's stupid. You were perfect on stage. You must carry on writing songs. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What did you expect? The electronic test of the upper part is done. The engine too. Have I forgotten something? Walid? Yes. Professor Kamar? What? Which hospital? Thank you. Be very careful... - Mum, listen! - I know. Don't worry. I'll find him. For the first time, Beirut city centre was the target of a series of bombings. Saint Georges hospital? The wounded of Achrafieh are coming Clear the corridors! Joseph! - How are you? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Walid's leg was injured. He'll be alright. The doctors are looking after him. Do you need anything? No. I'm going to sleep a little. Alice! - Hello! - Are we disturbing you? - Mona! - I couldn't stay at home. It was horrible! The noise! The girls couldn't sleep. The animals... Can I stay until it settles down? This one is good. - Who wants to sleep next to me? - Me! - Me! - Not on my bed! Get up, you two! Come on! Georges, we're at your brother's. It's safer. I'm scared of sleeping alone at home. They're all fine. They send their love. Don't worry. I locked the house. Yes, the shutters too! Is that all you worry about? What counts is that you come home. I'm alone with the kids. Take care. - You're here! - Mimi! - Good evening, Alice. - Good evening. You should see the shop. An entire wall collapsed. - You don't mind if we stay... - No! - Until things settle down. - Come in. Sorry, just... I couldn't leave these in the shop, so... I thought... - This way. - Thanks. - Is that all? - Yes, thank you! So, is it a hotel here? Amal needs a whole suite for herself! You're such a tease! Open this bed. Move the table. There's nothing left. Forget it. Hello. Look at the colour in the light, it makes it shiny... We're getting rid of things by selling our stock. We are taking a lot of space already. You don't mind? Don't worry. He's just a bit tired. - Do you want to help us? - Yes. I don't know. What do you suggest? Hello. Alice, the lady of the house. Feed us! Feed us! Feed us! You'll make the building collapse! Thank you! Pass me your plates. I'll serve you. Not the best moment. I'm stuck. Pass. You've got a great hand. I don't have any good cards. - Is it my turn? - Your go. As we wait for confirmation of the tenth ceasefire talks, some good news. The Soviet probe Venera 9 has landed on Venus. For the first time in history, you will see pictures taken from the surface of another planet. It's with these images, dear viewers, that we wish you a pleasant evening which I hope is peaceful and safe. To be expected, the eleventh ceasefire only lasted a few days. We advise you to avoid Damascus street, and the big hotels area, scenes of bloody battles. Exceptionally, the fifteenth ceasefire seems to go on. But be careful if you want to walk along the corniche to enjoy the mild autumn temperatures. Since this morning, it is unadvised to go out around Martyrs' Square. Despite the fifteenth ceasefire, mavericks in ambush aim at passers-by in order to cause an outburst of violence. Winter is coming and fear is taking over Beirut. Violence spares no neighbourhood. Only efforts from each and every one of us can put an end to the tragedy our nation has been going through. That is why I invite you to use this twentieth ceasefire to join tomorrow the great demonstration in favour of national cohesion. Hurry, we're going to be late. I missed you. Hey! How are you, Ahmad? Let consciences awaken, let love prevail. - I'm going to bed. - I'm coming. Dear God, I never ask you anything, but please put an end to this conflict. I beg you, give us our former life back. God of our country, God of the Protestants, of the Druze, the Shiite, the Sunni, of the Alaouite, the Ismaili, of the Melkite, the Roman Catholics, of the Maronite, the Greek Orthodox, of the Catholic Greeks, of the Apostolics, of the Assyrians, of the Syriac Orthodox, the Orthodox, of the Copts, of the Aramenians, of the Chaldeans, of the Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, please, have mercy upon us. My dear husband, how are you? He wants to go back to Ithaca in seven letters? Ulysses. Crazy world in six letters. Crazy world... - Asylum? - Yes. Watch out! Be careful where you tread. Girls, stay there. There's glass on the floor. Tony, bring a broom please. - I'm sure Selim is fine. - How do you know? Fady, come and help me. - Yes, Raymonde. - My dear, I have bad news. My brother told me that a militia is going around the area, entering homes and destroying everything. Letters, photos, souvenirs... They don't leave anything that you care about. My source is reliable, it's his neighbour the policeman. So be careful and don't open your door. I'll warn the other neighbours. - Bye. - Thank you, Raymonde. Bye. Another rumour spread by Radio Raymonde. No. - No. - What was it last time? The water we drink is polluted by Syria. Poor woman! No, my darling, that was on the radio. You don't think Raymonde is right? I don't know. Everyone has gone insane. It's unsellable. Why not make sunny landscapes? The sun sells better. I'm just saying it to help you. I'm closing the gallery. We're flying to Paris on Tuesday. Paris? But why? What do you think? The country won't exist anymore in one week. And Selim... Do you think he'll find a job in this mess? If no one is brave enough to stay... I beg your pardon? Goodbye. Hi, Selim. Look. I wish to go to the Baalbeck Festival to see Demis Roussos. I was thinking of Mona. It's tough for her. I've never seen her like that. She'll get over it, she's strong. Selim will come back when things have settled down. But us... We could go to Switzerland, until things calm down. - Have you thought of it? - We're better off here. I promise. I wish... For the whole family to visit space on board your rocket. I wish to see the end of The Accursed Kings. I wish we could have a second bathroom for the family. I agree. - The blue or the white one? - White. An orange one? The star. - Hello? - Hello, it's me, Selim! - I know it's you, Uncle Georges. - You got me. - Do you have any news? - Yes, he's arrived in Paris. - I hope you'll be together soon. - Yes, I hope so. - Of course, my darling. - Lots of love. Kiss. - Hello, Georges? - Hello? We're all here! - Happy Christmas! - Happy Christmas darlings! Daddy, when will you be back? As soon as they open the airport, darling. If I could, I would swim home. We miss you, darling. Hello? Georges, I can't hear you! I'm here, darling. - How are you? - Fine, my darling. - Girls, don't grow up too fast. - We won't. Fady, are you studying or only having fun? Seriously, Dad? Don't worry, I'm watching over them. You're the only one missing. Everyone is fine here. Hello? Amal? Can you hear me? Stupid country! Whether it's in Lebanon or abroad, the green line dividing our capital stands in everyone's mind. Calm down, guys! From now on, people speak of West Beirut and East Beirut as if we were already preparing ourselves for the end of common life. A dish of hummus weights 500 grams. Each adult eats 250 grams. How many dishes do we need if we invite fifteen people? You have two minutes. Yes, we have some! Alright, I'll show you some lace. Look. The queen of England used it in her private sitting room. - These are originals. - Yes, originals. There are different patterns and two colours. If you take all the stock, I'll deliver it to your house now. Good idea. - Deal? - Yes. - Let's do it. - Agreed. Let's go. God give you strength. If there's a ransom to pay, we'll all chip in. I'll sell my jewels, my gold. We'll get him back! - Won't we, Joseph? - Of course. We'll find him within two days. - This country... - Fady! He was driving a blue van. He went on a delivery to Gemmayzeh. He should have been home for dinner. What time did he leave? - Do you remember? - Yes. Five o'clock in the afternoon. Half-past at the latest. Go home, do not go out and do not try to find him. We'll call you when we have news. - Understood? - Yes. Sign at the bottom of the page. It works. I'll be fine. Are you sure? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. After almost a year of conflict, here we are, helpless, with three armies, two police, twenty-two militia, forty-two parties. We are mediocre, even in evil. Members of Parliament are gathering tomorrow Villa Esseil to try to organise the elections of a new president. We must find the strength to hope that they will finally agree. I've got something to tell you. It's important. I'm going to join Selim. I'm going to go to France. Peace will be restored anytime soon. Why doesn't he come back? He has a job over there. That's impossible. How are you going to go? His uncle Amin is driving to Paris next week. I'll go with him. Everyone who comes back from Paris says the same thing: France is far too expensive! Guess how much a pair of shoes costs? 300 francs! That's where you want to go? - The French are not welcoming. - Yes. Apparently, they throw Arabs in the Seine. Why would I stay? I've made up my mind. It's sorted. His mother can put us up for a few weeks... I'm sorry. We must confiscate her passport. It's safer. Mona isn't a child anymore. - She's right. - But... - This is no place for young people. - How... If you stop her from leaving, she'll join him and break off all ties with us. She's in love. You know? She'll be back. When all of this madness is over, she'll come back. - Goodbye, Mona. - Goodbye, Mona. We will miss you. I still cannot understand why we... Why you let Mona leave. You thought it was for the best. But you did not realise that if we stopped being together.. Dear Joseph, I'm leaving without regret. You must think that I resent you for letting Mona leave. You're wrong. It was the right decision. I was fine with it. Anyway, I was far too busy to miss Mona. I drew like I hadn't done for months. The election of the new president promised the end of the conflict. Raymonde had stopped worrying about all of those rumours. Mimi seemed to have leads to find Tony. Fady was growing up and becoming a man. Fady! Hello, Mum. What is that? It's a shame that Amal decided to wait for Georges in the mountains, far from the city's temptations. Get up. Come with me. Come on, girls. Anyhow, I never lost hope at any moment. There's no doubt about it, Monday 15th November 1976 will make a mark on Lebanon's history. After 18 months of war, peace has been concluded thanks to the intervention of our powerful neighbour. The cooperation between countries opens a time of outstretched hands and reconstruction. A task already tackled by the peace-keeping forces in charge of guaranteeing safety, trust and stability of Lebannon Minister of reconstruction Professor Kamar? Come in. The Minister is expecting you. Hello. Hello. Nice to meet you. So? Are we back on? Apparently. I already got started. I'll show you. I thought we could make a wider base and leave more space here for the engine. - Is it too ambitious? - On the contrary! I will suggest an option with more space here. - You can go even further. - Great! Get in the car. Take care. I rely on my favourite Swiss lady to watch over the country. Bye, Georges. Brother, we're going to miss you. Since the airport has reopened, many Lebanese people have decided to leave for good. Experts believe these desertions won't affect our country's recovery All even agree that 1977 looks highly promising for Lebanon. Here is a reason to be extremely proud to reunite our people after the trouble that upset the country. That is why, Professor Kamar, we rely on you and your team. Your efforts are those of an entire country. Undoubtedly, the prototype presented by Lebanon at the congress in Washington will open the road to the stars on board the most beautiful rocket in the world. Thank you. Minister. Bravo. Dear Mum and Dad, it's grey in Paris, but everything is fine. I find it hard to enjoy what the city has to offer as my thoughts are with you every day. I see the destruction of Beirut on the news, despite the declaration of peace. I imagine what you're going through Why don't you consider leaving? My coming back for Christmas seems compromised unfortunately, because of Selim's work. We are still living at his mother's It would be complicated to welcome you but we can find a solution. I send my love, dreaming every night of Mum's cooking and Daddy's lovely voice. I love you, Mona. - Ready, everyone? - Yes. Mister Joseph? Forty... Forty-five... Fifty. Congratulations, everyone! We did it! We did it! Finally! How is Joseph? Joseph never stops. He often comes home late but the project is going well. Will you come to the launch? No, it's going to be complicated with the children and school... I understand. - Give Georges and the kids my love. - Love to you too. Bye, Amal. Hello. We are the peace-keeping forces. Search the house! Search the bedrooms! If you aren't hiding heavy weapons, there'll be no trouble. Has the water been cut off? - Alice, are you there? - Yes. Is it ready this time? There are a few adjustments to add to the engine, but yes. The day before the launch, we could go for a ride, us two. What's up? It's not that difficult. - What have you got? - 130. 130. Put it up to 4.5. And now? The killing was denounced by different factions who took up arms in retaliation. On location, the peace-keeping forces strive to bring back peace... Watch out, guys! It'll pass. You're not going back, are you? I had Walid on the phone. Everything's fine. They're already there. Can't you wait a few days until we know what happened? - It'd be more cautious. - Definitely not. The team relies on me. I can't let them down. You're completely reckless. Perhaps that, that morning, the tension of the previous months caught up with us. Otherwise, I don't think you'd have said I was too selfish to understand that the country needed you. Under other circumstances, I don't know whether I would have mentioned your pride, your delusions of grandeur or your galloping megalomania. It's true. I probably went a bit too far. But, I would never have thought you capable of telling me, If you're too fragile, you can go back to Switzerland. - Excuse me? - It's true. Get some rest. It'll do you good. The damage isn't serious. Don't worry. We'll just be a bit late. Okay. Let's go. Alice? Fine. Is there a better time to buy a swimming pool? You too, give your home a new twist thanks to Jbeil Swimming Pool Show. If you buy a pool before... 22nd March 1977 engine check. Testing the third, no the fourth... Alice, it was clumsy of me to tell you to leave. I don't want to continue to inflict this upon you. I'm afraid that... You must leave, find a safe place. By staying here, you take risks because of me. I cannot... I belong here. This project might be insane. This dream. But I must carry on, to try to see it through. I'm afraid that nothing is like it was anymore in this country that you loved so much. I'm ashamed to see what it's becoming. I'm ashamed that you see it like this. I cannot admit that the place where our love was born has changed to this extent. Our paradise has been destroyed, each one of us is responsible, but no one will ever be guilty. That's enough. Come on, guys. You'll have to go to Cyprus by boat. Then take a plane to Zürich. Unfortunately, Switzerland hasn't reopened flights to Lebanon. You're lucky, a boat is leaving tomorrow at 2PM. And the next one? In two weeks' time. If you can, don't delay. My feeling is that the situation isn't going to improve. Anything else? Yes. I'd like a visa for my husband. Of course. Here. We're almost done at work. It's the worst time for me to leave. But I'm glad you listened to me. Some rest will do you good. The war won. We stopped having fun. We stopped laughing together. Did we laugh too much to be able to be brave enough to face our tears? Have a good trip... I beg you. Leave without regret. Take only the most beautiful parts of our story with you. I would like to hate you to be able to leave without regret. But the more I try to understand the disaster of our story, the less I manage to. Each word I write reminds me that we could have continued... To live, to create, in our own way, despite everything, magical moments. My love. Subtitles: Marion Cole SILVERWAY MEDIA
