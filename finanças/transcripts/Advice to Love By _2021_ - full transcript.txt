I believe the search for love is a scientific endeavor, and as a society we've never had more data to process about ourselves and each other. And when we truly understand this data it allows us to make calculated and informed decisions as we identify romantic partners. It sounds like you're saying you've hacked romance. Well... I mean, if there's a way to eliminate some of the wasted time and energy that goes into dating, wouldn't we all want that? Okay Kendall. Your best-selling books Dating and Mating in the Modern Age and Swipe Left: From Data to Dating. These focus on your science of love philosophy. Using the mind to help the heart. Right. But neither of the books mentions your own love life. I'm curious. If my own methods have worked for me? Let's just say I'm still kissing frogs, just fewer of them. Okay. Let's get some questions from the audience. Mitchell wants to know how to get rid of nerves before you go on a date. Ah, okay. So the physical symptoms for nervousness, the dry mouth, sweaty palms, accelerated heart rate. Those are actually the same as the physical symptoms for excitement. So my advice is don't get rid of the nerves. Embrace them and reframe them. Next question we have is from Jill. "After a breakup how do I know I'm ready to date again?" Ah, that's easy. Use facts instead of feelings. How do you know if you're ready to date? By going on a date. Actually that gives me an idea. Where's Jill? Okay great. Hi. And where is Mitchell? Okay great. I am sending you two on a date. Yeah. My treat. Go on a walk, grab a coffee, have a meal. Mitchell, embrace your nerves. And Jill, see if you enjoy being out with someone new. This is kind of awkward. It absolutely is. But being embarrassed on live TV together will at least give you guys something to talk about, right? Okay. Okay, great. So it sounds like Jill's in. Mitchell, are you? Sure. Awesome. Have fun. That was definitely a first. Okay. One last question from the audience. This is from Sheila. Okay. She wants to know what you think about romance experts. Mmhmm. Like Doctor Lovestruck from Pacific Sounder Magazine who insists real love is all about fate and feelings. Well, Doctor Lovestruck writes an interesting love column to be sure. But that should not be confused with real science. I'd like to thank Kendall Turner for joining us today. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Be right back after these messages. - Thank you. Did you hear that? Mocked Doctor Lovestruck on TV. He inspires people to fall in love. What is so wrong with that? Right? He spreads hope that at any moment two people would meet and bam, fall in love. He provides a real community service. Exactly. I mean, the science of love? What does that even mean? Who knows? You know, I should contact this Kendall Turner and ask her some questions. After all I am a journalist. Moonlighting as an anonymous romance advice columnist. Come on, man. Doctor Lovestruck is Superman. I'm, I'm just Clark Kent. Oh sure. If Superman was a romantic. Superman is totally a romantic. He flies Lois Lane all over Metropolis. That dude knows how to plan a date. Plus that hair. You know, the only reason I volunteered for this gig was to show Perkins I'm a team player. I mean, do I wish that I had more time to, to pursue projects and stories that I'm passionate about? Of course I do. But before you know it I'll be features editor and someone else will have to cover Doctor Lovestruck. Well, good luck finding someone. It certainly cannot be me. I think it's probably better for the people of Seattle if I just stick with art direction. I do not have anywhere near your level of romance. Speaking of which... Oh, speaking of which. Did you do what I suggested? I booked a cabin at Mount Rainier. Ah, my guy, my guy. And? And, and we're going up there this weekend. And? There should be more? It's your wedding anniversary. Give her memories that she'll tell her grandkids about. I got it. A trail of roses that leads to a candlelit dinner for two, with twinkly lights where someone is playing the acoustic guitar and they're playing the first song that you guys danced to at your wedding. I don't play the guitar. I know you don't. You find someone who does. To drive out to a lakeside cabin? It's about the grand gesture. Just trust me, it'll work. - Okay. - Okay? All right. Thanks man. - You got it. - I got it. You got it. You got it. Oh uh, one question. The, the rose petals. Do I do those or do I hire someone for that too? I'll do it. You know you do it. Thanks buddy. He doesn't have it. Yeah, I mean it's just so much fun every time I go on that show. The best. I mean, matching two people on a blind date live on camera was a stroke of brilliance. Oh, I mean who knows if they'll actually hit it off on their date, but at least they'll get some practice. I mean half the battle is getting the date. It is trending on social media which means free publicity and the Emerald City Book Gala just reached out and they want you for the opening night. - Hey! - Okay me next. Is there anyone in here you can set me up with? It does not work like that. Well, I wish it did. If only you could be my fairy godmother. Ella, you do not need a fairy. You just need to use your beautiful wonderful spectacular mind. I know. Think my way to finding a perfect partner. I read your books. Exactly. Speaking of which. Mm. - Nothing? - I'm working on it. Publish or perish my dear. You know my work takes time. I do. I do. And as your devoted editor I get it. Your thorough research is what makes your work so unique. And you're a big seller so publishers won't forget you. But... But just don't take too long? - Correct. - Got it. Don't worry, you will figure something out and it will be your best book yet. - Okay? - Okay. Can you believe this Doctor Lovestruck? "Be the hero of your own love story "with a grand gesture of affection. "Stop traffic. "Hire a skywriter." "Be bold and you will be rewarded." Can you believe that? Sounds romantic to me. Of course it's romantic. But skywriting is, is just hot air that fades into nothing. It's literally the epitome of not making a commitment. It's all smoke and mirrors, just without the mirrors. So you want me to agree with you? Yes. Mmhmm. Well I'm not, but you are the expert. I am. And I meant to tell you I'm bringing Tyler to your reading. You think after driving around in an ambulance all day saving lives he wants to come and listen to your big sis talk about romance for an hour? If he knows what's good for him he will. Oh. Okay. Seems like you guys are getting kind of serious. - Will you do me a favor? - What? - When you meet him. - Mmhmm. Will you just be my sister and not romance expert Kendall Turner? Kendall? Okay. I will be off the clock... for you. Cheers. The magazine is sponsoring the Emerald City Festival of Books this year and we're doing our usual coverage but I thought it would be nice to spotlight some local participants. Speaking of which I have your next assignment. It's an author profile. Kendall Turner. The Science of Love lady. Ah-ha. You know her? Yeah, I saw her interview the other day on The Morning Show. It's too bad I can't do it at Doctor Lovestruck, one romance advice writer to another. Well, that's why I thought you'd be perfect for this. Now, as you know your confidentiality agreement means that you can't tell her or anyone that you're Doctor Lovestruck. But I'm confident you'll bring a unique perspective to this. 2500 words for the next issue. You got it. Oh and Hart, Your profiles often make the cover and that's what I'm looking for. Keep up the great work. Can do. Oh, almost forgot. This crowd is incredible. Thank you for pulling it together. Oh, anything for my favorite author. I'm going to look in the back, see if I can find some more chairs. Great. Sorry I'm late. Great turnout. I know, right? Uh, who was that guy you were talking to just now? Oh Grant? He's the store owner. - That's Grant? - Mmhmm. I talked to him on the phone but I've never seen him in person. He's cute. Is he single? I don't know. Well maybe you should find out. We did coffee once. The good news, we talked about books for two hours. The bad news, that's about all we had in common. - Idea. - Mmhmm? The perfect PR moment. Author and bookstore owner reconnect and start dating. It's like a rom-com. And just as fictional. Grant is a great guy but we are just friends. Our happily ever after is purely platonic. Hmm. Such a shame. He has such a nice smile. Yeah. Ah, hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for an event that's all about romance. You know how to find it and how to keep it. I know I could certainly use a few tips. So without further ado please welcome best-selling author and love expert, Kendall Turner. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Ultimately falling in love is a choice. And being in a healthy relationship means actively making that choice to love every single day. It may not sound romantic but it is. Making a conscious decision every day to love that person. What's more romantic than that? - Sounds romantic to me. - Thanks. Everyone, we're going to be setting up for the book signing. So if you'd like to stick around for that, it will be in just a few moments. Thank you so much for staying around to sign books. Of course. It was really nice to meet you, Tyler. Thank you, Kendall. I hope you enjoy it. This was great Kendall, congratulations. Thank you. Meet you at your place tomorrow? Sounds great. See you tomorrow. Bye. - Hi. - Hello. Who should I make it out to? Larry please. Okay Larry. Well, I hope that you enjoy it. Uh no, Larry's my best friend actually. I'm Nathan. And I already read your book. Oh! And what did you think? It's... entertaining. Entertaining? Really made me curious about your personal experience with love. Oh. Well... You are not the first person to ask me that. You're not even the first person to ask me that this week. Well, I bet you got some great stories. I hate to burst your bubble but I use a standard statistical approach. I talk to a large sample, I gather the data, I try to leave my subjective views out of it and let the information speak for itself. - Oh. - Mmhmm. Okay. Well, your research is impressive. Thank you. But most writers write from their own point of view, and you have to get that from somewhere. So I am curious about yours. Nathan Hart? We met at the press club last year. You were moderating the Q&A with Rebecca Solnit. Yeah. I'm Ella Karlin, Kendall's editor. Nice to meet you again. Yeah. Um, Nathan is a reporter for the Pacific Sounder Magazine. Oh. He didn't mention that. Well, I know I didn't, I didn't mention it yet. But my magazine wants to do a profile on you. Here's my info. Maybe we can set up a time to get together in the next few days for an interview. Oh great. That's funny, I feel like the interview's already started. A little bit. We will be in touch. Well, I hope that Larry finds this helpful. And entertaining. Okay. I'm sure he will. Well, I'd say that was a roaring success. We've almost sold out of your book. Well, you put on such a great event, how could we not? I'm Ella. I'm Kendall's editor. - Uh, hi. - Hi. - Kendall, always a pleasure. - Oh, yeah. We'll do it again soon, maybe next week. Uh, no that doesn't make sense. I'll, I'll call you. Or text. Or email. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Can you believe that guy? He's not so bad. Oh, oh Nathan. Oh, don't worry about him. It's a puff piece. You've done a million of them. But he called me entertaining. That's a bad thing? I mean it's a bit condescending, don't you think? Do not let him press your buttons. It's one interview, you never have to see him again. You did so great today. - Thank you. - Yeah. Let's get out of here. Come on. Okay. - Here's your latte. - Oh. Almond milk, extra foam. Should I be worried that you know my coffee order? Come on. You're not the only one who does their research. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. Sorry to interrupt. Thank you for the coffee. She told you. - Made our day. - Ah, there you go. Your husband is a real gentleman. Oh, he's not my... We'll do the same thing one day. It's amazing what a little kindness can do. That's nice. My dad used to do that when I was a kid. Hmm. He'd pick up the tab for complete strangers you know? I mean Cara wasn't supposed to tell them it was from me, but... Cara? The barista. Her and I we have this thing, right? Oh. So I come here so much I just kind of look at her and I give her like a little... Yeah. You have that... you have that rapport. Got it. Now you making fun of me. Yes, I'm embarrassed. Okay, I'll quit. Mm, don't be. You're very clever. Very theatrical. Oh. Theatrical. What does that mean? Your shtick. Impress your interview subject. Charm them even with an "I'm just your friendly neighborhood coffee buying journalist" approach. It's an effective way to establish the way you would like me to see you. All right, so how do I want you to see me? Generous and thoughtful and therefore trustworthy. Are you cynical much? No, I am just skeptical about someone who sees what I do as entertainment. You matched two people on live TV. So you're telling me that's not entertainment? I spontaneously saw an opportunity for two people to open the door to romance. Okay? Statistically most dates don't lead to a relationship so if all that comes out of it is just courage or confidence in taking a risk then that's a win. It comes down to internal compatibility which can exist even if on the surface it looks like it doesn't. Okay. I'll buy it. Ella, I know what the next book is. I decided I'm going to be the focus of my own research, collecting and recording emotional data directly from the source. Testing theories, putting myself in the middle of it all. Okay. Interesting. But I'm still not quite clear on your angle. The angle is me. My next book will be an account of my own personal dating experiences. Think about it. I've never written about myself before so I am putting myself out there and I'm giving my readers something totally fresh and new and exciting and what are you thinking? It's about time. Ah, see you like it? I love it. Amazing. Are you kidding? I can already see the promotional tagline, "Science of Love author experiments on self." Mmhmm. Where'd you get the idea? Well... Oh, my gosh. You met someone. I did, I did. And I think he could be totally wrong for me. But that's okay. Wait, I don't get it. This guy is a blank slate. So I can try various methods to test our compatibility without any expectations. It's perfect. So he could be the wrong guy or the right guy. Right. I mean, that's the point, I have no idea. Do you see the potential? I don't know but I love seeing you this excited. Both professionally and personally. I mean you know me Ella. I love a new research project. Yes, you do. I'm so glad you like it. I love it. - Breakthrough. - A breakthrough. Hey. Save some for the rest of us. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I need my caffeine now. All right, all right. I gotcha, I gotcha. There you go. Tell me when. Keep it coming. - Tell me when. - That's great. All right. Hey. How was the whole anniversary thing? Oh yeah, it was good. Pretty good. Decent. All right. What happened? Well, she was super surprised by the rose petals and the dinner by the lake. I told you. Grand gesture, it's a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Until Anita had an allergy attack from the flower petals. Oh. Then it rained. Dinner got soaked. So we had pizza. Yeah, you can't account for mother nature. You should have seen her. Her face was like... Even she said she looked like Rocky after a fight. Hmm. But you know, a dose of Benadryl, a little snuggle by the fire. Turns out it wasn't such a disaster. It turned into the most memorable and hilariously bad but great anniversary of all time. You see? Now that doesn't surprise me that something unexpected turned into something romantic. Uh-huh? Uh-huh? Oh, I didn't even tell you. I interviewed Kendall Turner for the profile. Oh yeah. And it's incredible how seriously she takes this science of love thing. I mean I have never seen someone so serious about love. It must be for a reason. Are you always this curious about your interview subjects? I'm just saying man. Like there's a story there, okay? That's all you're saying. I'm sure that's not all that was there. Don't you have work to do? Hey man, I make my own schedule. - You do roll in, roll out. - Yeah. I'll give you that. Joy! I've been knocking for a solid minute. I'm sorry. I have been busy having a breakthrough. Oh, I think I can actually see smoke coming out of your ears. This is a hypothesis for how to tell through a series of dates and certain activities if I'm with the right person. Rather, the best match for a long healthy relationship. I have designed an interactive compatibility test. So more science of love. Better science of love. Check it. There are four steps. Signal interest, connect meaningfully, demonstrate worth, and most importantly establish trust. So basically dating? No, it is entirely different. I am trying to see if I can track the building blocks of a relationship as it comes together or where it falls apart. Hmm. Sounds like a party. If I'm not willing to test my own boundaries then how can I expect other people to? - Well I'm impressed Einstein. - Thank you. But it's time for your dinner break. Okay. - Okay, one last... - No, no. Okay. So I'm standing in my waders, you know, hip deep in water. And I look up and all I see is Joy jumping up and down, waving one arm, and holding the fish, pulling the other. Okay, I was trying to yell but the river was too loud. So I eventually get over and she had caught a fish but she couldn't get it off the hook. So she was keeping it underwater but it was pulling her into the river. We were in a national park so all the fish are catch and release. But the, the truth is I wasn't actually trying to catch anything. I was only pretending to fish so I could spend the day out there with Tyler. Aww. I can't believe you went fishing. I mean that's so unexpected. - I know right? - I have to say she's a natural. Okay. So Tyler, every day is life and death for you as a paramedic. You love the Mariners and the Seahawks and fishing, apparently. But what are your thoughts on art? Oh. I, I have no artistic aptitude whatsoever. But I know what Joy makes is beautiful. I knew she was special from the first moment I saw her. Just two hungry souls vying for the last spring roll at a wedding reception. You should have seen how fast she snatched that thing up, smiling the whole time. No regrets. And then I had plum sauce all over my face and he handed me a napkin, and it was love at first sight. But you guys do know that there's no such thing as love at first sight. My beloved sis, are you seriously trying to correct our adorable meet cute? I'm just saying, people can be attracted to each other at first sight. But it's completely biological. You always do this. She always does this. It's funny because I just read something like that. The guy who writes in Pacific Sounder Magazine. Oh, don't tell me. Doctor... - Doctor Lovestruck. - Doctor Lovestruck. He says you can tell within the first few minutes of a date if it's a good match. Signs from your neuroreceptors, not your heart. Well... Wherever the signs came from, I'm glad I was paying attention. Aww. - Goodnight. - Goodnight sis. Goodnight! Hello? Hey, it's Kendall Turner. Oh. I'm glad you called. I have, I have some follow-up questions. When you've got a moment of course. Saturday. Lunch in the park. Whew. Okay, I'm confused. Are you dating this woman or interviewing her? Oh, it's definitely an interview. I'm just not sure if it's a date too. Is it a coincidence that you happen to have professional hair and makeup on the same day as your date with Nathan? You are the one who said I needed author photos for the next book. Besides, it is not a date. I thought you asked him out. Well I did. - So it is a date. - It's research. It's work. Aren't you worried you're crossing into an ethical gray area here, as a journalist I mean. I mean I had an idea for a different type of article. You know, Kendall Turner is a romance expert who literally disagrees with everything that Doctor Lovestruck says. You do like him, don't you? I don't know, but that's not the point. It is a chance for me to test out my theories, maybe add a little color to the profile he's writing. Plus he's going to have a great time. I'm taking him to that popup fair and then lunch at the park. Interesting. It's not interesting. It's science. I can't tell her that I'm Doctor Lovestruck now, can I? I mean other than that I'm just going to follow the same advice that I give in my column. I mean Perkins loves my outside the box ideas. I mean this could break me out. I can conduct a straightforward interview, or... Or I can pit Kendall's advice against Doctor Lovestruck's. Aka me. What if you guys don't click? Like what if you have a nice time but you don't hear bells? Hear bells? It's what my mom always said. You know it's love when you hear bells. Okay, see that is exactly the kind of reason I need to write this book. The goal of the first date should be familiarity. Spend enough time together to get rid of some of the nerves. Talk, listen. It has nothing to do with "bells". - You see these? - Mmhmm. You can't get these anywhere else in the State of Washington except right here. - Really? - Yep. Huh. So I'm not just getting her flowers. I'm getting her flowers that say I put forth the effort and then I thought about her because when I look at these flowers I see her. I'll have these please. Thank you. Okay, and the fact that you are starting your relationship with a lie? First of all, she and I are not in a relationship. We're just getting lunch, and she asked me. Second of all, I won't lie. I may have to omit some details but I've never lied to her. It's like I'm undercover. How about that? Okay. But what happens when the covers come off? You're such a pessimist. Come on, man. I come from a long line of romantics. I know what I'm doing. Thank you. Give these to your wife. Ah. She does not deserve you. My Dad bought my mom flowers and still does. The first of every month. He says that 10 minute errand is worth the smile on her face. He says it's the reason they stayed together this long. She has no idea what she's in for with you. No, she doesn't. - Good? - Great. Okay. I know your brand is all scientific method... - Uh-huh. - But keep an open mind. I always do. But the data will speak for itself. Let's look at the pics. Hi. I'm Kendall Turner. I think you have some books for me to personalize. It's great to see you Ms. Turner. Until I read Swipe Left I had no idea I'd been doing online dating all wrong. Oh, you are so sweet. Thank you, it's always nice to meet a fan. Your books are just in the back. Give me a second. Oh great, thanks. Kendall, I was just thinking about you. Oh, I bet you say that to all the authors. I was surprised to hear that there were so many special orders. Oh, our customers love books with a personal message. And since you're local and can come on down and sign them, why not? Well whatever I can do to make the readers happy. You know whenever I see someone browsing by your books I tell them I know The Science of Love author personally. - Oh. - And she's brilliant. Aww. Thanks. Then they ask if your books have worked for me. And I have to say not yet. Oh. You know I could actually use your advice about romance. Sure. There's um... someone who's caught my eye. Mmhmm. And we have a professional relationship but I'm interested in something more. Ah yeah, that can be tricky. But do you know if she or he feels the same way? She, and no I don't, but I really want to find out. You mentioned she's a colleague? She's in publishing, yes. Do I know her? - She's beautiful and smart. - Oh. And funny. And... Did I mention beautiful? Uh yeah, you did. I don't want to fall in the same trap I always fall into, getting friend-zoned before I've worked up the nerve to express myself. Oh. What do I do? What would you do? Nothing. Nothing. No, nothing. Nada. Zip. Don't do anything. That way if she's interested she will come to you. It will protect your professional relationship which I'm sure means a lot to her. Maybe you should even play hard to get? Look, I don't normally advise playing games in romance but in this case I honestly think your best option might just be to ignore her. - Hmm. - Yeah. Do nothing. Not a single thing. - No. - No. - Okay. - Yeah. You're the expert. I sure am. Yeah. Ooh, books. Gotta go. Yeah. Gotta sign. Yeah. Hi. Hey. What's so funny? Oh hi. Nothing. Nothing at all. Aww! Those are for you. These are lovely. Those are a local variety. There's a woman that runs a farm. It's right down the street. She has these... Hey, do you, do you know who writes the Doctor Lovestruck column? Uh... I mean the magazines can't have that large of a staff. Right? I mean I guess they could freelance it or outsource it which could help with privacy. Mmhmm. Either way, as much as I hate to judge people I don't know, I have to say I think he's doing your readers a disservice. Why would you say that? Well, for instance in his last column he said that first dates should be outrageous and memorable. Studies show that first dates are more efficient when they take place in a location or environment that is casual or encourages relaxed conversation. I see. I'm going to take this one. I haven't had a Jamaican patty in years. Oh. - You want? - Yes please. Two please. Yes. Apparently, Doctor Lovestruck thinks all first dates should be fireworks and champagne. I mean... Mm. A daytime activity, ideally something interactive, creates a space for clear connection. Mmhmm. Now I think I understand what we are doing here. - Oh do you? - I think so. - This is really good. - Smells good. I'll come back for it. Bells. Those are more like chimes. Bells usually have like a "bing bong, bong bong, bong bong." Wait. You hear them too? Yeah that's, I mean it's noon. That's Saint James Cathedral. Oh. Yeah, duh. Of course. You all right? Yeah. I cannot tell you the last time I had lunch in the park. So thank you for the invite. Well, thank you for saying yes. What made you get into this? You know, helping people find love. A really bad breakup. Mm. Like the heart-wrenching, stay in bed eat ice cream for a week, cry at commercials kind of breakup. But then I figured out the problem. It wasn't me. It wasn't even necessarily him. It was just, it was us. We didn't work. And I realized that everyone would save a lot of time and energy if there was a way we could figure that out sooner. How about you? Any bad breakup stories in your past? Come on, don't we all? Mm. - But I was wondering. - Mmhmm. Do you think your ex ever bought a copy of your books? Oh. Well, I hope so. Okay. I mean it must be hard dating now, come on, as a romance expert. Actually, yeah it is. I feel like people are either trying to impress you or they're really skeptical of you. It's hard to find people who are actually just themselves, but I try to see through all the posturing. - Ah. - Yeah. - Gotcha. - Yeah. What about the feelings though? You know, what about the, the butterflies in your stomach and the lightheadedness. Uh-huh. Come on, there's nothing like that feeling. Oh, that's just your vagus nerve responding to your brain processing anxiety. We are actually the ones who assign that meaning, so. You know, you can be a bit serious. Well, you can be so distracted. Do you have anything planned this afternoon? No, but... Perfect. I have an idea we should just throw ourselves into. - Ugh. - Come on. So any hints about what we're doing? Oh no, that wouldn't be a surprise. Okay. Well I'm not the biggest fan of surprises. Trust me, it'll be good. - Okay. - It'll be good. So... why Seattle? Why Seattle? I applied to about 60 magazines and newspapers all over the country. Mmhmm. Anywhere that would accept me. Okay. I was just so passionate about being a journalist I would've gone anywhere. Let me guess. You are up with the sun and the first one in the office every day. Not every day, but... Every day. Pretty much every day. Yeah, yeah. Listen, it's not a criticism. It is just an observation. I buy it. Ah! A judo class? How did you know I'm into martial arts? I didn't. Oh, you're good. All right everyone. Let's start with some stretches. You're sure you didn't dig this up in some old interview or magazine article or something? I just thought about it when we were sitting down having lunch earlier. Mmhmm. I believe that spontaneity is one of life's greatest pleasures. So how is this for a twist ending to our first date? Well, this is definitely a first for me. I'm not normally this spontaneous. But... But? Judo camp every summer, buddy. Obviously. Try and keep up. Alright, you got this, I got this. I got this. Right leg first. Tough. That's okay. Let's try it again. All right. Time to practice your throws. Call me over if you need any help. Ready? We'll see. Ah! Hey, woah! What happened? That was on you. Ella: Thanks everyone, and don't forget to send me your marketing and publicity suggestions as soon as possible. Thank you. Thanks guys. Bye-bye. Kendall, I just want to say I think this could be your biggest book yet. Thank you. I told you they'd love it. And if the marketing team is excited we are already ahead of the game. I mean, you're sure it wasn't too early to bring up this idea? I only just started my research. Yes, but it is you that they're selling. Your perspective, your experiences. Mmhmm. You're putting yourself out there in a new way and that's what makes this a whole different ballgame. Plus we can reserve a publication date. Valentine's Day next year? We'll tease it out to the press during the gala. I'll get you some talking points. Okay great. What's the matter? Don't tell me it's a writing injury. A judo injury with Nathan. - Judo? - Mmhmm. His idea, but I did dust off some of my old skills. Uh, clearly. Okay, so aside from the bodily harm how was it? Okay. Um, I think he was trying to impress me, so that was kind of cute. Boys and girls get ready for class, because it sounds like we have chemistry. Okay sure, the chemistry was there. But it's only there because I'm doing all the right things to create it. Are you sure about that? I mean sometimes it just happens naturally. Ella! Are you... are you seeing someone? Okay, it is really new and I'm not talking about it. Oh, my gosh! No, I'm not talking about it because I always do that. I always talk about it too soon and then it jinxes everything. Okay, okay. Well, you know what? I think I need to interview you for my book. No way. No. I need to save all my stories for the inevitable tell-all memoir I will write after I have lived a full and crazy life with this new prince charming that I am not talking about anymore. Okay. We're done. We're done. We're done talking about it. So... when are you going to see Nathan again? And, I guess, the real question is are you going to tell him that he's the subject for your book? He is not the subject, I am. He is just a factor. Sure would be interesting if he turned out to be a bigger factor than you think. Uh... I mean... Are you mad at me for making you fall at judo class? Because this kind of feels like punishment. Not at all, accidents happen. But it did get me thinking you can learn a lot about someone when you share a perilous situation. - Perilous? - Mmhmm. As in peril, as in "Danger, Will Robinson" peril? Yes. - Well... - Right. Suit up. All right. You're doing good. You're doing great. There you go. All right. - You got me? - I got you. Come on. Whew. All right. I'm going to just slide on back. You're a natural. This is great. I am relaxed. I have found my spot. Come on up. Hi. What's up? - You okay? - Woah. Are you, are you going to, are you going to stay here or are you going to keep going? I think I'm going to keep going. Of course you are. I think I'm going to keep going. Wow. Okay, you got up here so fast. You. You know, I'm so glad you invited me all the way up here. No seriously how many times did you do that? Why does it matter? Because the whole point of today was to see what a challenging environment brings out in you. - Ah. - Mmhmm. Well, I think the whole point of today was for you to embarrass me. No. That was not the point. That was not what I was trying to do. Okay. But it doesn't matter because it looks like the joke was on me, huh? - Mmhmm. - Mmhmm. Listen. I really enjoyed myself today. - Me too. - Yeah. I'm enjoying getting to know you. Same. So nice to talk to someone who doesn't have anything to hide. So in the spirit of full disclosure... Okay, yep. All right. I am, I am writing a new book, so. Okay. I'm making myself the subject of my book and using my own personal experiences with dating as research. It's only fair to tell you since you're kind of part of that now. Well, I guess it makes sense now. All the notes you've been taking in your phone. Oh, that obvious, huh? Only to a reporter. Only to a reporter. So I have a question. When you write about me in your book, are you going to change my name to protect the innocent? Of course. Can I pick the name? I always want to pick the name. I want to go like Rocky or Spike. - Spike? - Spike. Okay. - We'll see. - All right. Have you, have you ever written about yourself? Made yourself the subject of your work? I think sometimes we have to. I think we have to mine our own lives for our work and use our point of view. Otherwise what do we have? - I agree. - Good. Yeah. Well. I think today gave me some really good material but I have so many more questions for you. Okay, well listen, I hope you know that I'm only going to tell you about the times I was a hero. Mmhmm. I'm not going to tell you about the time that I hid in my closet when a bat flew in my bedroom. No way! Joy, these new paintings are so good. Are they all going to the gallery? Yeah. I've already got a buyer for one of them, I think. Well, that's not surprising. Clearly whoever this buyer is has great taste. You are too kind, sis. So I'm bringing someone to your show. Someone like a date? You been holding out on me, sis? Not really. It's complicated. Yeah, love always is. Not in that way. I'm not really sure how I feel yet. You'll figure it out. You know, when Tyler and I first met I went back to one of your books. You did? Even though our relationship felt strong, Tyler and I don't make a lot of sense on paper. Hmm. But then I thought sometimes romance is just unexplainable. There is such a thing as a good feeling. - Pure instinct? - Yes. Instincts aren't something you can really quantify. Well, you don't have to. You just have to listen to them when you're around your man. Okay, he's not my man. We'll see. It's getting somewhere right? Yeah. We're devoting our usual coverage to the book festival this year. I'll be emailing you all your assignments with who's covering what. Levi, great layout last year. Do even better this year. We go to print right after the festival so we're going to have to be on our toes. Any questions? Excellent. Thanks everybody. Oh, Hart. Yes sir. I read a draft of your profile of Kendall Turner. Smart move integrating the Doctor Lovestruck angle. Thank you, thank you. Have it fact checked. Make your final edits by Friday. Should I maybe give her a heads up, just so she's not surprised when the article comes out? It's up to you. When it comes to your subjects, I'm sure you know best. Hey, did he talk to you about the features editor gig yet? No. Why? Katherine, she put in her notice earlier this week. - Really? - Yeah. Look at you, you are ready. Your path to promotion just opened up. Bigger stories and no more Doctor Lovestruck secret identity business. That'll be good because Kendall admitted she's writing a new book and that our experience together is going to be part of it, man. Oh, cool. Eh... That's very cool. Yeah. Hey, you got to make sure she gives you a really cool fake name. Already did. Spike. Oh, nice! So does this mean that you told her about the Doctor Lovestruck angle to your article? I almost did. But it's because we're in a similar situation, man. But then I realized that if I'm in her book then that means that we're probably most likely... Yeah, we're dating. I don't want to mess this up. But then there's that whole "science of love" thing. And it totally contradicts everything that Doctor Lovestruck writes in his column. I mean my column. Me. But then I have this professional obligation to myself and my readers that I just have to tell the truth. It's... you know? So I'll probably just let the article come out and if she likes it, she likes it. And if she doesn't, she doesn't. And then we can just go from there, you know? - Right? - Right. You give such great advice, man. So a promotion? That is great news. I mean, obviously it's not a done deal until it's officially announced but it could happen anytime soon. - Oh! - Yeah. Well, then this seafood is definitely the way to celebrate. - Really? - Mmhmm. It is the best fish and chips in the city, and that is coming from a local. Mmm. I can't believe I never heard of this place. Mmm. You're welcome. Well, thank you. Oh, this is beautiful. Yes, it is. Wow. So I wanted to ask you, you ever think about living anywhere else? I've thought about it. Mmhmm. But every time I come to the same conclusion, that everything I want and everything I need is right here. Hmm. That must be nice to be so sure about everything. Maybe it's that or maybe I'm just overly cautious about the unfamiliar. I mean, you're about to put yourself into a new book that millions of people are going to read. Mmhmm. I wouldn't call it cautious. I mean crazy, crazy. I will do anything for a good experiment, okay? I hear you. Look, I did want to say thank you for being so supportive. Especially since I didn't tell you about it at first. What can I say? Spike is a supportive guy. Smells delicious. Tyler is a great chef, which is wonderful since we all know that I can't even boil water. What are you making? Vegan chili. I'm trying to perfect the recipe. It all comes down to paprika. Wait are you vegan? He is sometimes. We're working on it. Oh how's your new book coming along? Good. Fine. Good. That was convincing. Hey I, I read one of your books. Oh! - You did huh? - Mmhmm. What did you think? I like what you said about how unique every relationship is because the way two people come together is specific only to them. The match principle. Yeah. That made a lot of sense to me because even though we're so different... Together we make sense. Let's just say vegan chili was not in my kitchen repertoire before this one came along. Now if only I can get you to eat it. Baby steps. Oh guys, before I forget, they gave me a couple of extra passes to the gala because I'm speaking- Oooh. Including the opening night party. - You want them? - Absolutely. So it's like a book party? Kind of. Awesome. This is going to be so much fun, thank you. Of course. - Cheers. - Cheers. You want to try some? Yes. Ooh. - It's silver. - I see that. - It'll be memorable. - That's one word for it. Well, I like it. Well, it would look great on you. It would, wouldn't it? Yeah. I'm actually kind of nervous about this event. Why? You do speaking engagements all the time. Yeah, I know. But I don't normally talk about my work before it's finished. Also this is so personal. Don't overthink it. Just be your natural charming self. I arranged for a car to pick you up and I will meet you at the venue to walk you in. Oh. You could drive with me if you want to. Well, my date is actually picking me up. Wait, you're bringing a date to the gala? Mmhmm. Is it the mystery man? Mmhmm. So you guys are like approaching official couple territory now. It's so weird. I feel like I'm finally with someone I can actually be serious about. What about you? Anyone special cheering you on from the audience? A certain reporter perhaps? Uh, I don't know. I mean it's kind of a work event for both of us since he's covering the gala for the magazine. - Kendall Turner. - Mmhmm. All the more reason to make a bold choice. Do not miss an opportunity to be dazzling. Oh, okay. Actually, it could make for good research. Explore how environmental elements impact the way two people spend time together. You know for a love expert, sometimes you take the romance right out of things. - My book is the priority. - Should it be? Wow. This place is beautiful. Now I know what you're thinking. - Mmhmm. - Wine tasting, how original. Well, I have been honing my skills for the past couple years. Mmhmm. And I believe that wining and dining is an essential part of every romantic relationship so I am going to guess your taste. Based on what? How I do martial arts and climb rope? Pretty much. Well, bold move Mr. Hart. Well, if you haven't noticed, bold is pretty much my thing. As we move down the line, we go from sweet to dry, and lacy and light to robust and chewy. - Hm? - Chewy? Oh, it means earthy and rich. My advice? Let the wine speak to your senses. Let your taste buds find the flavor of sunlight or dirt. And if your spirit sings, well then, you'll find the flavor of your heart. And one cannot live a fulfilling life without it. Well, thank you for that. Well, there's someone who's passionate about their work. Mmhmm. I have a question for you. Sure. Do you think you'll ever write about something other than the science of love? Yeah. I mean I, I think about what will happen when I settle down, get married, have kids, get older. And so far that all seems like territory I can't wait to explore. Mmhmm. Mm. I do think about teaching sometimes too. See I can see that. - Oh yeah? - Professor Turner. Has a nice ring, right? Maybe one day. Do you ever worry about making your relationship last? Odds aren't terrific. I love the idea of growing old with someone. Having a family, creating decades of memories. Two people just side by side growing old together. I want that epic love. I mean who wouldn't? What if it's not epic? What if it's just cooking dinner and carpool and temper tantrums, and paying bills and picking out a new carpet. Can you stick out the day-to-day regular life? That's what makes it epic. Excuse me, Miss Turner? - Oh. - Remember us? Oh, my gosh yes. Uh, Jill and... Mitchell. Sorry to bother you, we just wanted to come over and say hello and thank you for introducing us that day. Ah, okay. So you're the couple from Seattle Today that she matched on air. So we took your advice, um, went for coffee. Why not, right? We just couldn't stop talking. Turned out to be the best day of our lives. I am so glad it worked out. You saw something in us. I don't know how but thank goodness you did, because you were right. We're so grateful. - Thank you Miss Turner. - My pleasure. Bye. Wow. Well, that was nice. That was epic. I believe it's time for the lady to make her choice. Oh um, yeah. I think I like that one. - The cabernet. - Mmhmm. Oh wait, wait, wait, no. This one. The 2018 blend. It's a wonderful wine. One that the gentleman correctly guessed would be your favorite. Well done, sir. How did you know that? Well, you're not the only one that's taking notes when we're together. And I know you also don't like surprises. I figured you probably would have gone for something a little more well-known. It's basically the same thing you did when you matched two perfect strangers. Well, I didn't necessarily know that they would hit it off. I just knew that they had one thing in common. Dating nerves. Be that as it may, they look very happy. Now, come with me. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Okay. Wow. Well, we did the wining. Now it's time for the dining. - Cheers. - Cheers. This is gorgeous. Well, I figured it was time. Time for what? Time for a full-on, unabashed, top to bottom, romantic dinner. Oh, you're good. Well, it's not every day that a guy gets to try his moves on a science of love guru. Well... It is pretty enchanting. That means a lot coming from you. Hey man, you going up or down? Earth to Nathan. What are you doing out here? Uh... I don't remember. Are you okay? Yeah. I think. Is this about Kendall Turner? Have you succumbed to her science of love ways? It was just a simple profile. A puff piece. And I turned it into an interrogation of her methods. And then we had a great time. Now, I don't know. - You fell for her. - I guess I did. What are you going to do about it? That I don't know yet. Oh hey. If you need some advice you should ask that Doctor Lovestruck guy. I hear he knows what he's talking about. You would say that. Nathan, there you are. I've been looking all over for you. Hi Louis. It's Larry. I need you to come to the Board meeting tomorrow. There's been an uptick in the web traffic for the last few Doctor Lovestruck columns. Matter of fact the numbers are the highest they've ever been and the Board would like to meet Doctor Lovestruck in person. I'm glad to hear it. I mean I don't read the column myself. After three marriages I'm pretty much an expert on romance. But my assistant tells me that the advice has just gotten better. I'm glad your assistant can find it useful. It's not just him. Metrics don't lie Nathan. My office will be in touch with the meeting details. It was good speaking with you. Yeah, you too Lionel. It's Larry. It's not, it's not funny. Joy! This is beautiful. Congratulations. I've already sold four paintings. Can you believe it? - I am so proud of you. - Thank you. Wait where's, where's Tyler? Ah, oh. He's, he's over there. He has been working the room like he is my agent. He probably deserves credit for half the sales. Oh, amazing. But wait. Where should I start? Oh, well I'd start by grabbing a glass of champagne. Noted. And then start over here. All my stuff is on this side of the room. This is so exciting. Okay, I'll see you in a bit. - See you. - Okay. - What's up? - Hi. What do you think? This Joy's? Tell me what you think and I'll tell you if it's one of Joy's. Uh... I like it. That's it? Yeah. That's it. Well, I am sure Joy will be glad to hear that you like it. Well, I look forward to meeting Joy. Yeah, she's uh, right over there with Tyler. Well, I must say inviting me to her show, I'm flattered. And meeting your sister? That's a serious step. A crucial one. Yeah, because your book says "our family and friends, they give us perspective." - Oh. - Mmhmm. A perspective we sometimes lose when we're caught up in our feelings. They provide a good counterbalance. Well, I know how important she is to you. - Come on, let's go meet her. - Okay. - Joy. - Hey! This is... So nice to finally meet you. Nice to meet you too, Nathan. Hi. - Tyler. - Pleasure. Nathan. What can I do you for? Couple of minutes to chat? Yes of course, of course. Come, come in, come in. Sit down. Take a seat. I think I know what this is about. Actually... Features editor. You know the position is opening soon and you want to let me know that you're interested in the job, yes? Yes. I'd very much like to be considered for that position. I know, I know. I pride myself on keeping up with what's going on around here. And I don't mind telling you that's one of the reasons I'm introducing you to the Board today. That way when I make my recommendation that we make you features editor they can put a face to the name. Does that mean? Yeah, yeah. You've got the job! No sense keeping you in suspense when you're clearly in knots about it. Thank you sir! I don't know what to say. This is tremendous news. Thank you Mr. Perkins. I promise you that I will work so very hard to make you and this magazine proud. I know you will. Oh, and by the way, it's your responsibility to find someone to take over as the new Doctor Lovestruck. Though I expect you to continue to oversee it and keep it anonymous, of course. Of course. But that's not why I came in here today. Oh? No. It's about the Kendall Turner profile. Okay. After I wrote it, Miss Turner and I kept seeing each other on a more personal basis. Hart, are you telling me you're dating your interview subject? Yes, sir. Well, have you altered the profile in any way because of this personal relationship? No. I was-I am, I am totally objective in my reporting. Well then I don't see a problem. Then I say great. - Thank you sir. - Oh yeah. Of course I don't have to warn you about the disadvantages of dating a writer since you have that in common. No sir you do not. Everything is copy! Thank you. Hey. Hi. No, no, no. Sit, sit, sit. How are you? Well, this is a nice surprise. Yes, and I'm sorry it's so last minute. It just, there's something I want to talk to you about. Okay. So there... Can I get you anything? Oh uh, just an ice tea for me please. I'm good. Thank you. Okay. So that is a nice dress. Thank you. Yeah. I like yellow on you. Is this your way of buttering me up for something? What's going on? No. No, no, no. I actually wanted... Oh, thank you. Thanks. Okay. The reason why I had you come out here today so rushed and everything is because I wanted to tell you that I have... Oh, my gosh. You got the promotion! Yeah. Yes, yes, I did. I am so happy for you. Wait, wait. Features editor right? - Yes. - Tell me all the details. What, what does that mean for you? Uh, it means that a few things about my job will change but a few things will stay the same. Mmhmm. But there is definitely one thing that I will have to give up. - Oh no. - What? This guy, he's really nice and he's always been a really big supporter but I'm pretty sure he has a crush on me and he's, he's here. Really? The last time I saw him I think he was going to ask me out and it got really awkward. But I do feel bad for him. So if he comes over here let's just... Oh great. Stop looking. Don't feel bad for him. I think he's on a date. What?! Look over there. Oh! That's Ella, my editor. I knew she was seeing someone but she didn't tell me who it was. Okay. Here they come. Hi. Busted. Nathan, you remember Ella Karlin, my editor. And this is Grant, the owner of Book Salad. Great store, dude. Oh. Well thank you. - Is this... - The mystery man? - Mmhmm. - Yes. So when did this happen? Well, as you know we met at your reading. - Mmhmm. - And there was a spark. And I thought I was being clear that I was interested in him. Which she was. And then I asked for your advice about asking someone out. Yeah. And you said to do absolutely nothing. Lo and behold it worked. Look at that. I got so tired of waiting for him to call, I called him. The science of love expert strikes again. Boom. And it's nice to see you again as well Nathan. Likewise Ella. We're excited to read the profile you wrote. Oh, Nathan is the reporter doing the piece on Kendall. Oh. It should be out soon, right? Next week. And you'll be at the gala too? You know it. Ella: Great. Would anybody like to order any food? Oh absolutely. Sorry. - Well that was a surprise. - Yes. But I'm glad Grant didn't let his crush on you hold him back. You just had to bring that up, didn't you? Come on. Of course I did. Suffice it to say my instincts were a bit off on that one. Just a little bit. But it's okay. Nobody's right 100 percent of the time, not even an expert. Hey I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to celebrate your happy news. And wait, wasn't there something else you wanted to tell me? Yeah, it's just something I'm working on I wanted to share with you. But it, it, it can wait. - Okay. - All right. Listen I was actually thinking that if you're not busy or I don't know, too swamped with work after my event, maybe we could grab dinner? Just us? I mean I promise I won't take notes. Yes. Great. - Yes. - I'll text you. - All right. - Okay. All right. - I'll see you later. - Bye. Actually Kendall... It'll probably be a little romantic so you may want to take notes. Okay. It's done. Well, happy Saturday to you too. The whole proposal? Already? All done. All finished. "Do as I Say and as I Do:" "How the Science of Love Worked For Me." A working title. I like it. But does this mean... It sounds like you're saying you fell in love. No. I mean, I guess it could be interpreted that way. But it's really just meant to suggest that I took my own advice and here's what happened. Look, here's the table of contents. You can look at the journey. - Mmhmm? - What? A romance author in love. I'm sorry but this is going to be great PR for the book. Gosh you need to stop. Just because you are head over heels does not mean everyone else is. Not everyone else, you. I saw you guys. Sparks, chemistry, compatible biochemical reflexes or whatever it is you call it in your book. Ugh. You guys have it. This is a good thing, right? You're happy? Yeah, no, yeah. I'm happy. I just, I do wanna see where it goes. Oh, so do I. So do your readers. Art imitating life imitating art. Are you going to give a copy to Nathan? Oh, I don't know. Well, if you're serious about him, why not? That way it's all out on the table. You know, you're probably right. Plus he's a writer too so he can give me helpful feedback. Bingo. Oh. Are, are you reading now? You want me to, that's my cue to go? Just let me know what you think. - I will. - Okay, bye! - Hi. - Hi. I brought you something. I could've left it at the office for you but I really wanted to make sure you got it today. I'm glad you called. A few things I want to talk to you about as well. All right come on in, please. Looks like you're working today. Yeah. Editing an article. Uh, can I get you anything? Um, just your honest opinion. I think that you should read my book proposal. Since my experiences with you are a major part of it and, you know, even if this doesn't continue they'll still be part of my work. So in the interest of full transparency and because I want you to trust me, and because I think it's only fair for you to see it, I think you should do so. And then there's some things I want to talk to you about as well, I mean I wanted to wait and come over, take you out but... I mean, since you're here let me grab you some coffee and you can have a seat and we can hash it out and talk about everything. - Sounds great. - All right. - Um, almond milk. Right? - Right. Do you edit the Doctor Lovestruck column? Not exactly. That's what I wanted to tell you. Technically I'm contractually obligated to not reveal my identity, but since... Wait. Are you Doctor Lovestruck? I was going to tell you, but the magazine keeps it anonymous. But listen... Now that I got a promotion someone else is taking over the column. I was going to tell you the other day but we got interrupted by Ella and Grant. Hm. And the irony is, is that the column has never had more readers since you and I have been seeing each other. It's like the column got better and I think it's because of you. That is ironic. Also ironic is the fact that I was doing research for my book while you were doing research for the column. But the difference is I was totally upfront with you about it. I know, I know. I feel like you haven't been honest with me. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, okay? But I was trying to stay truthful to my work and stay committed to what I was doing there. I think I need to go. Kendall. Come on, just... Yeah I, what's funny is I actually built a whole chapter around building trust. Turns out I was completely wrong. No. Just read my column, okay? You'll see. I learned so much from you. You can trust me. Huh. Your devoted sister is here with sustenance and caffeine to get you through your day. Thank you. Also then maybe borrow an outfit from your closet just to shake things up. Oh, take anything you want. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. No you're not. I know you. No seriously, I'm, I'm fine. What happened? Nathan. I had all of these feelings for him, feelings I haven't had for anyone in a really long time. You love him. What? You heard me, you love him. You set out to test your theories on how to find the right partner and you did it. Your method worked. No, not really. I mean, the fact that I fell for someone who was keeping things from me is proof that I have to throw the whole book out. There's no way I can get up there tonight and talk about my work knowing that it's all wrong. Kendall... You may be the science of love guru but as your sister I'm an expert in the science of you. I have watched you and Nathan together. I've seen how happy you've been these past few weeks. He's going to be there tonight, right? Yet again our work brings us together. Yet again maybe it's fate. Well, you tried it your way and look what happened. So maybe stop trying to intellectualize it and go with your feelings? Well, that felt good. I'm just saying you have a chance to talk to him tonight and hear him out. For once don't worry about blood pressure or heart rate. Trust your instincts. Now it's time for hair and makeup and choose my dazzling outfit. Can't I just wear sweats instead? Oh girl, you got it bad. Okay, let's start with makeup. - Hi. - You look stunning. Thank you. Joy pulled it all together. Well, I guess it really pays to have a sister who's an artist. Yeah. You looking for somebody? I haven't seen him yet. Oh no, I wasn't. But look, we need to talk. There's a problem with the book. What? Don't be silly. Here, come on. Come on. I'm going to take you upstairs. We're going to relax. We'll get you situated before the Q&A. Come on. - Larry. - Hey. I've got a favor to ask you. Yeah. Anything for you. Ah, actually no, you should tell me what it is first. Okay. Any chance you can help Doctor Lovestruck with one last romantic gesture before he retires? Oh. Absolutely. Let's do it. Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the Emerald City Book Gala's opening night. We'll be kicking off the evening with a Q&A with author Kendall Turner. Hi. Thanks. Thank you for joining us. Well, thank you for having me. Before we get to audience questions I was wondering if you could give us a preview of your new book. A little birdie told me it's a real departure from your previous books. Sure. Well, I wanted to do something different this time around, so instead of interviewing other people I decided to make myself the subject. What do you mean exactly? I made myself, my feelings and my experiences with dating, the focus of my research. And let me tell you it was definitely a different experience writing about yourself. And? What did you find? Well... I guess you just have to read the book to find out. At the author's request we'll be devoting the bulk of our time tonight to questions... I gave the guy 20 bucks to turn off all the audience mics. This is the only one that's on. Volunteers in the audience with microphones so if you have a question just raise your hand and... I have a question. It's about forgiveness. Nathan, what are you doing? And it's also about trust. I've read your work, Miss Turner. And I know from personal experience that you put your heart into everything you do in your life. Your research, your work, and the people you care about the most. And I was a very, very lucky man to be one of those people. You were one of those people. And you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I know we have very different approaches on our feelings toward each other, but I learned so much from you. And I know that a grand gesture is still a good way to show someone you love them. This is how I'm going to say I love you, Kendall Turner. Will you let me show you how much I love you? Will you give me that chance? Yes. So was, was that too much? Absolutely. I want to tell you I read your new book proposal. And? I think Spike is one lucky guy. Yes, he is.
