Block the road. -Get ready! -Yes, Sir. Traitor! Get out, you dog! Open the door! BAGHDAD IN MY SHADOW ...with another... ...with another jailer. You are still... Baghdad, you are still... ...in my life. In my shadow. Baghdad, you are still in my shadow. But you have replaced one jailer with another. Move, traitor! Coward. Move! You shit. Admit! Your brother's a communist! Admit it! Taufiq? It's Maha. The police took Nasseer. It's serious. -What? -They took Nasseer. Please do something! -Don't worry. -For the love of God. -I'll handle it. -You're all I have. Don't worry. Taufiq Jasim. J, A, S, I, M. You were born in Baghdad. A writer! And now you work as a night watch man. Why have you called me in? I told you everything already. Some things just don't quite add up. What did you call her? Amal or Souhair? You're aware that she acquired her residency permit under a false name. Women need to enjoy themselves... When will you know that I love you? I saw your model of the school. To be a pupil there. Watch out, the teacher is strict. That women jogs past here every day. Whats she look like? -Well, kind of southern? -I think maybe Arabic. Listen up! Who do you think fucks? And who gets fucked? You mean who's the cock and who's the chicken? They're watching us. Well, Fritz, should we stay or should we go? Laughing behind my back? -No, no... Samira. -What are you saying? -We would never do that. -You're our beauty. Now I see. Shame on you! Do I ask if you're on top or under your wife? Amal, darling. Bring some tea! Okay, Zeki. I have to work. How are you? Sit with us, Amal! Just for a moment. I have to work. Were you arguing? You know Zeki. I'll tell you Fritz, there will be no revolution without us. Why would a person like Muhannad, go to a place like Cafe Abu Nawas? What do you mean? We know he likes men. Are you implying I'm gay? No, we're just saying he likes men. -Hello, Muhanad. -Zeki. Amal, darling. Some pickles, please! Zeki, it looks bad. Your computer is dead. What do you mean, dead? The drive and the hard disk are broken. That's why it rattles. It's rubbish. Get rid of it! This is your chance: buy a new one! Piece of shit! Fix it, or I won't pay. Ok, from the beginning. How long have you known Ahmed Kamal? Purpose for your visit, Mr Kamal? I am in the new cultural attache. I didn't know there was an Iraqi culture centre. Culture exchange is more important than ever. Thank you, have a nice day! Next. But it makes no sense for the cultural attache to kill his ex wife. Can I help you? No, thank you. I'm just doing some stretches. Right, we notice you like to watch us doing our work during your stretches. Yes. Is that against the law? We're building the new home office department. Yes, says so on the sign. -So, you think I'm spying? -I don't know. -May I ask who you are? -Me? Martin Hartman, the construction manager responsible here. Who are you? I think you are doing a good job. Oh, well thank you very much. Well I'm an architect. At least I was. Who do you work for? For no one. I'm from Iraq. Unfortunately I can't work here as an architect. We know what you want aye! Go for it, lad! Sorry! Wow, you're from Iraq? You don't look it? -Really! -Yes. -So how does one look Iraqi? -Sorry... You think all Iraqi women have pop-eyes like Zaha Hadid? Oh dear! Start again, I'm Martin. Nice to meet you. I'm bit of a dimwit shall we say, who likes any insight into the wonders of the orient and I apologise. Well, perhaps I can help you. I've had a lot of experience with backward people. I'm Amal Jerjis. George in English. Nice to meet you, George. I have to go. Would you like to go with me to Zaha Hadid exhibition? What? Change the subject. Tell us a bit about why your nephew joined up with extremist islamist. What my nephew got to do with Ahmed Kamals death? Nasseer is a good kid. Nasseer! Breakfast is ready. I'm fasting. As the Prophet instructed: "Sala Allah Alihi Wa Salam." It's not Ramadan yet. I'm simply respecting the laws of my religion, mum. What? "My religion"? So, not mine? Mine is the religion of my forefathers. Not all this! That's sinful. It's not true Islam. True Islam? So, you want to teach us? Fritz, fritz, come on doggy. Come on, there you go! -No kiss? -No kiss. Going for breakfast at your Abu Nawas? At mine you get breakfast in bed, every morning. -You know I have to stay at the hostel. -So? And report to the Refugee authorities every morning. Then marry me and all your problems are solved. You know, I'm glad you showed up. Close your eyes. Happy birthday, my dear! Who'd have thought your lot were doing this 12,000 years ago. You know, we don't celebrate birthdays. Why don't you just take me along and introduce me to your friends. Don't your sweet old communists scarf a gaze? Once you get asylum you'll earn well. Better than that cheapskate. Look what I have for the reading! "For a Free Country and Happy People!" -What's this stuff, Samira? -Stuff? Taufiqs right, this stuff is lame. Lame? I cooked Patcha. Lame? These days that means: "old fashioned"! Are we communists or fashion designers? This reading is very important. I've invited Maud. Old Maud? -Who's Maud? -Taufiq's girlfriend. She's the editor of a respected publishers: Old Vintage. The Old Vintage witch. How's the Patcha? It's... Kurdish style. No! It's international. Very delicious. -Red fronts! -Zeki's witch. -How ya doing ya old cranks? -Kate! Here's your son. How's the revolution going? Aro! Good to see you! -See you at the concert tonight? -Still stressed? When are you coming to get him? Three week's time. -Take care of him. -What? Damn it! You're a real man. Dear Zeki, even back in Kurdistan you didn't get it. What do you mean? It's not a disease. So what? What's it got to do with politics? If you deny homosexuality it becomes political. Zeki, it's part of our nature. My nature? I better go and cook. Tell me Zeki: Why did you name your café after a poet who was a gay alcoholic? This is incredible! It was his idea! His! What's funny? He's mocking Zeki's cooking. Of course, you have the right to remain silent. Nonetheless, it would help us a lot if you could take us through the entire events in detail. If someone makes an attempt on my life I'm not allowed to defend myself? Just press this button longer and harder. And there you go! Come on, Zeki. There's more. Slowly does it. How's Nasseer? I don't know what to do. Don't worry, we're here for you. He's a good boy. Taufiq will take care of him. Sure. But where is Taufiq? He hasn't answered his phone in days. I've got to go. -Thanks for the delicious Qeema. -You're welcome. My dear Maha. You raised him well. Now look after yourself! Why don't you find a man? But first, take off your veil! No one forces you to wear it. Don't worry! Firstly: I don't need a man to look after me. Secondly: Why are men always telling us what to wear? Just a thought: Your shirt is so ugly. Why not find a nicer one? As I say, when we were under attack, I saw Amal flee into the park. I was worried about her. Why don't you just tell us killed Ahmed Kamal? Maha. Thank you. I told you before: I don't eat this meal of infidels. Isn't it your favourite meal? Why infidel? It is, but not during Ashuraa mourning. This doesn't sound like you. These aren't your words. And this isn't you. Your father didn't think like that when he married your Shi'ite mother. If he had, you wouldn't be here. People like you help the West control us with fake ideologies. What do you mean? Why do you want to forbid us this traditional meal? What will your friends forbid next? Rituals for Hussayn are heresy they have nothing to do with Islam! There's no God but God. What did I tell you? Nasser! May I come in? Why are they still up? -Does it still hurt? -No. But the racist bastards are free. Don't let people like that affect you. Didn't you want to go back to college? No, what's the point? No ones waiting for me there, no one needs me in here. Least of all, you! You visited me a couple of times in the hospital, but after that, you never visited me again. True. When you were little I was there. I looked after you when your mum went to work. -How's your Arabic? -What do you want? Remember when you and your mum first came here? I took you to the Zoo every weekend. Your mum said your dad loved elephants. Remember? Enough now. What do you want? Do you remember when I taught you poetry? The Koran would've been better. -Koran? -Yes. The language is difficult. We'll read it together, but not here. In Zeki's café, like the old days. Alright. I'll join you at the café, but only if... If what? If you join me for Friday prayer at Sheikh Yasin's mosque. He who can shall marry in order to satisfy his natural sexual desires. He who cannot marry shall fast in order to contain all sexual orders. I ask God for forgiveness and mercy. Amen. Seek refuge in Allah from the evils of this promiscuous society. The body of a muslim must remain clean and these whorey women are unclean. Not worthy of you, you should only marry a faithful muslim to share your pleasures. Homosexuality is a sin in Sharia Law and death is the only punishment for those who wallow in homosexual scene. -God save us. -God bless you! God blesses your prayers. In the name of God... The skinhead incident... Do you think that's enough to explain why a kid joined a radical group? So explain it to us. It was all my fault. Peace be with you. Peace be with you. -Everything is fine? -Yes, good! Please, enter! It's an honour. Dearest Taufiq... Dearest Taufiq. I'm pleased to meet finally, Nasseer's uncle. I am wondering how come you never join our prayer services? Nasseer told me that you carry doubt in your heart. My religion is between me and my creator. Just as the Koran states: "There is no compulsion in religion." The Chapter of the Cow. You're very familiar with Allah's words. The Chapter of the Cow, verse 55? Correct. I told you, Sheikh, he knows the whole Koran off by heart. Damn it! What the... -It's broken. -What? It sounds like the hard disk is broken. If it rattles like that it means the drive is losing it and the hard disk cannot get a grip. That's why it makes that sound. Your uncle even knows about computer. Unfortunately, not enough. But I know someone who can fix it. -When can he come? -Anytime. You spend all your time at the cafe lately... Are you fucking this little Iraqi? Are you crazy? -Aro is the owners son. -So what? They're all straight Iraqis. -We're not in Baghdad. -I need the work they find me. Good luck! This Yasin is a psychopath who unleashes his fanatical followers on homosexuals inciting murder and you sent this poor boy to that mosque. So, you all know what you have to do. Mohammad. Last year's tree was far better. You've been ripped off. See? It's already falling apart! I should go. -And the tree? -The meeting won't wait. Can you decorate this miserable tree? Go to Amal. Amal, darling... -Don't worry, we'll manage. -Thank you, my dear. Go! Don't miss the revolution! Come on, Taufiq! You're lying. She's not a Christian. -Need a hand? -No thanks. My diplomas arrived from Baghdad. Very good, congratulations Amal! What's so good about it? -The name is different on them. -So what now? Study all over again? And risk being deported? Amal. No one will deport you. You're brave and confident. I'll think it over. Do you want to wash dishes all your life? I've met a construction manager. Very good. Can he help you? It's not like that. I think I like him. His name is Martin. Iraqi? Have you ever heard of an Iraqi called Martin? Why? Are Iraqis not good enough for you? Are you jealous? So, your "Free Country" is just for men? Good morning, my love. Some coffee? Good morning! I've missed you. Already. Yeah, only a little bit and not you know little. Why are you smiling? Being free. Being free? Of course, you're free. Shall I come and get you from work? No, really listen, I'll finish work and then come over to yours. -You? -We need to talk, it's important. I saw strange things in the mosque. Tell me! I saw Yasin give the boys envelopes of money. Nasseer was there. Really? Why didn't you tell me earlier? You are aware you have killed a diplomat. I dedicate the last poem to you, to Miss Maud Robinson. Yet Baghdad, you are still a prisoner behind bars. You replaced one jailer with another. You are still in my shadow, my Baghdad. And there you will stay forever. Iraqi poetry will always stay genuine. You were great! The poem was wonderful. Welcome. I'm Ahmed Kamal. Iraqi Cultural Attaché. Nice to meet you. I welcome the Cultural Attaché! Allow me to introduce you to Miss Maud Robertson. -Pleasure. -Ahmed Kamal. Editor Old Vintage Publishing House. So it's an honour to us Iraqi people, does have such an important publishing house, sent us such a lovely representative. Well, in Mesopotamian times, your country was the cradle of humane civilisation and gave so much to the whole world so we should appreciate that, shouldn't we? Please, please, Maud, excuse us. -Don't leave me alone for too long. -Of course. -Welcome. -Thank you. Aro, Zeki's son. I have to go. Hello, Suhair! How are you? I'm Amal. Amal. Suhair... Good to see you. There's a cafe in the park. I'll see you there tomorrow morning. See you there, why not? You still look good, Suhair. How many men have you been fucking? That's none of your business! You're still my wife, I can prove it. What will the Refugee Police say... Secret Service Special Forces. Republic of Iraq. Where did you get this? Does the new government know you worked for the dictatorship? -So what? -I have more documents. You're lying. I've changed, Ahmed. I don't want to see you again. Take care. I met a traveler from an antique land, who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert. And on the pedestal these words appear: May name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my words, ye Mighty and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round he decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare. The lone and level sands stretch far away. I do like Shelly. And no-one wanted to publish him either. Please understand that this isn't about the quality of your poems. You know, you find it normal that we know all your poets. It's not up to me, my boss. Move your ass then! We've had our eyes on Yasin for some time. The boys transfer the money to an account in Turkey, from there it's forwarded to Syria. They're evidently messengers for a terrorist organisation. Yasin's got about 30 boys lined up. Twice a week, each messenger sends ten thousand pounds. It amounts to a hefty sum. Your nephew alone has transferred over 120 000 pounds over the last 6 months. Can I have some water. -Are you sure? -We have a witness. I see. And what do you want from me? You already know everything. Mr. Taufiq, all in all you're a reasonable man. Why this reluctance to work with us? -Hi, can I get you anything? -No, thank you. Peace be with you. And unto you, blessings of Allah. -It's quiet today. -Praise God! -May I sit? -Please. I'm learning the language of the Koran. My uncle Taufiq is teaching me. -Thank God. -Thank God almighty. I'm Ahmed Kamal, Iraqi Cultural Attaché. Nasseer Karim. Welcome. I want to understand the Koran perfectly. -With God's will. -Thank you. -Where do you pray? -In the mosque at the end of the park. -We must pray together. -Of course. Come tomorrow? -I don't want to bother you. -No, not at all. Here's my number. Thank you. Surely those who come to this place, don't go to the mosque, right? My uncle says his faith is between him and Allah. Sheikh Yasin says that's heresy. Something like that tree shouldn't be here. In a place run by a so-called Muslim. Of course it's forbidden. Amal's idea, no doubt. Yes, but she's Christian. A Christian? In Iraq her name was Suhair: she was a Muslim. Muslim? -Yes. -How do you know? I know a lot of things. And in Iraq they know exactly how to treat such people. How? Tea, anyone? I have to go. God bless you. May peace be with you. Good evening! May I take your coat? Yes, of course. Thank you. -Hey... -Sorry... You look beautiful. I'm an Iraqi, but I live here. -You see? -There she is? Sketches! This is the new design for the central bank of Baghdad. Not here. Why? Not in front of all the people. What? There's nobody here. We're in public. You can't do that in an exhibition. Right, well maybe not where you're from but in England it's fine. -What do you mean where I'm from? -It just meant, you know... I just meant in Iraq, it's different. -I'm just old fashioned. -Well yeah, Iraqi, like I said. -Don't say that again. -It was a joke. I have to go to work. I need to talk to you. I know what this is about. No, it's not about the other day. The new cultural attaché is my ex-husband. What? From Saddam Hussein's agent to the new regime's cultural attaché? You couldn't find anyone else to marry? My parents didn't trust him. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to them. What's this? You don't want my baby? If I catch you again with these pills from your communist doctor friend, I'll make him disappear! Our neighbour Mazin vanished after he joked about Saddam. I found a report on him in Ahmed's safe. He had written it himself. These prove he worked for the dictator. Take them! And why didn't you hand these intelligence files over to us? Have you perhaps turned religious? You wouldn't be the first communist who in their hatred to the west had joined the islamists. People of your kind are the same in every country. Only we don't need to use torture. -Hey, Taufiq! -Hello! Sorry I'm late. Where were we? What's up? I met the Iraqi Attaché. -Did he bother you? -On the contrary. He opened my eyes. What do you mean? That tree is sinful. -What's wrong with it? -Heresy! Is that so? My dear, as a kid, you wanted a tree. And presents, like your English friends. It's a nice tradition. As a role model you must follow Sharia and not deviant rituals. You failed, you hypocrite! Enough! Ahmed's the hypocrite. He was one of Saddam's informants. -A Saddam informant? -Yes. A secret agent. He wrote reports that got people killed. I have proof. Tea anyone? Please Aro, leave us alone. Verse 63. Hypocrites are described in the verse on hypocrites. Peace be with you. And with you. I am very happy to be received in this gathering to support true Muslims and beside idealistic support we must not forget to offer financial support for your mosque. Thank you. Please, stay with me. And now allow me to answer your questions. Should Jews and Christians be forced to pay poll tax... We will give them the choice: either they must convert to Islam or they must pay a poll tax and obey the laws of Islam. And if they don't accept that... They deserve the sword. Hey Muhannad, nice to see you. -Hello, Muhannad. -Hello! Here's your new laptop. Any change? No, sorry. Come! Thank you. Zeki, listen to this! One of those cranks wrote a new fatwa: "Women may not touch fruits or vegetables resembling the male genitalia. " What if a man touches a banana or a cucumber? -Then what? -It was a pathetic internet joke. Made up by some perverse westerner with nothing better to do than watch obscene pornography online. A society following the laws of the Prophet, "Sala Allah Alayhi Wa Salam", would wipe out all pornography anyway. No doubt something Sheikh Yasin told you? Have a look at his browser history: Porno à la Carte. No way! Muhanad, you saw it with your own eyes? It even made me blush! That's a lie! What a hypocrite! Are you sure it was porn? You think I can't tell? -That's a devious lie! -Why should I lie? True, why would he lie? To make him look bad because he's Muslim. Your Sheikh Yasin has a special passion for blonde European pussies. Pussies at the mosque! That's disgusting! Stop right there! You atheists! You failure, you heretic. Why should I believe a homosexual? -Nasseer! -You trust this fag? Leave it. I'm not afraid to say who I am! The question is: Are you cocks or chickens? -I'm confused, Sheikh. -Why? Oh, come one. Speak up, don't worry. I was told that there is pornography on your computer. -And who said that? -Muhanad. Muhanad. How can you even think that something like that could taint this holy place? Nasseer! Listen carefully! I swear on Allah. I heard your uncle Taufiq plotting with the homosexual to upload porn onto Yasin's computer to defame him. He brought a gay in our mosque? Indeed, he has no faith apart from hammer and sickle. Once a communist, always a communist. It's true. Communists are godless. They're out to destroy Islam. It all adds up! Nasseer, it will be a day when you are going to have to make a choice and if necessary, even against your own family. In the words of Allah: "If they strive to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, obey them not." May peace be with you. I can't talk right now so please leave a message after the beep. Please Nasseer, call me. How's Martin? You're spying on me? So, he's your lover. They're copies! Where's the rest? Don't worry. They're safe. Dinner's ready. Not only have you built your own kitchen... you cook as well. Shouldn't every man be able to do that? -Like a housewife? -Like a housewife, exactly yeah. Muhanad! Aro! What are you doing here? You're hardly ever in the cafe. Hello, I'm Sven. Aro. -You're hardly ever in the cafe! -I was there yesterday. Hey you two, lets go over to the bar. He's my friend. So it is true after all. No, it's not like that. I hate you! Aro, wait... Just wait one second. This guy is fucked. Shit! -Lets take him home with us. -We can't take him home. Are you crazy! What's wrong with you! We can't just leave him here! Call his father. -His father? He'll kill us! -Call him! Wait! Where are you going? You're crazy! Do you know what he'll do! His father... They don't like us! What? Are you riding a camel? -You're late! -Enough! Close the door. Good morning! How sweet! To be young again. Go away, dog! He threw up, but now he seems okay. Come, come. Aro, drink! Dad! Were you involved in this? No, we found him outside the club. -He wasn't with us. -What club? -Can someone tell me what's going on? -Internal affairs. Come, come on! Get dressed. -Samira, no I want to sleep. -Don't be a wuss! That little bit of alcohol you drank! You should have seen us at your age. Nothing put us down. -I'm tired, please. -We had fun and we drank a lot. Sorry, guys. Our stuff. Thanks, Sven. Muhanad. I owe you. Thank you. Lovely! Don't drink too much when you're young. Ok, I get it. Can we please... Take him to the car. Are you okay? Dad, I'm really sorry. Don't worry, I love you. -Feeling better? -Yes. Let's go! Nasseer! Come. I need to talk to you. -Ahmed is a murderer. -Help your friend, Nasseer. Don't let this man through. He collaborates with the homosexuals. Go home! I'll speak to you at home, ok. You're an atheist. Admit it you're an atheist. Who are you to judge me? Who are you? We all know about your submissive plans. Don't touch me! And you lied about this place and about myself. Please! Nasseer, my son, come! Nasseer! He spied for Saddam, for a dictator! And you want to follow him? And you! smuggled your friend into this holy place to install a sinful website onto my computer! What are you talking about? This upright and loyal muslim has exposed you! You trust him? Ahmed betrayed us. He's a traitor! Nasseer, come with me, please! Please, Nasseer! Nasseer, come with me! Nasseer, Ahmed's a traitor! I promise you, all your problem are going to be solved soon. Yes. What? What can I get you? I don't know. Just wanted to surprise you I suppose. You did. What can I get you? Nothing. Then I have to go back to my work. Can I help you? You must be Zeki, right? -Yes. Have we met before? -No. Are you a friend of Amal? Yes, a friend. Her boyfriend? Amal's lover. I told you! Hand over the 20 pounds. 20 pounds? He's far too young for Amal. I'll give you ten. That's more than enough. A bet is a bet. You cheat! I'm no cheat! I'm Aro's father. Thanks to you! You are very handsome! Oh sweetie, what God made you? Sweet? O sweetie, what God made you? O sweetie, what God made you? My heart is bleeding because of your torture. Why do I have to be subjected to my destiny? Why do I have to be subjected to my destiny? I don't repent his love and God doesn't change him... You made him leave? What's wrong? So, you don't like the English? At least they know how to treat a woman! I married a good, pious Muslim woman but the devil has wormed his way into her brain. She is cheating on me with the infidel. I know in this country, I don't have the rights of a Muslim man. What do you think, Sheikh? Freedom of a religion, is one of the pillars of Islam. I say, that those who lose their faith, are a grave danger. They can corrupt the rest of society. I only see one punishment, death for all apostates. I'm telling you, Ahmed, the killing of this women is Halal, the earth must be rid of her poison and it is the duty of a man among men to enforce this. I'm sorry. I'm really truly sorry. I don't understand you. I don't. -You don't understand our customs. -Oh, is that it. Okay. You're accustomed to lying? As an Iraqi woman, I should not have an English boyfriend. Please, can't you see? No, I can't see, no. You're your own woman, you're a free person, you can do what you want. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Martin! Quiet! Stay where you are! Don't move! Take the weapons! Let's run! Who lost this? Who are you? I'm Fatmas father. She's my eldest. Come here! Happy birthday love. Can I open my eyes now? Your birthday cake. Should I heat up some food? What's wrong? What's wrong? Who's caused my father's death? You know that. Tell me again. The secret service, under torture. I know. Was he involved in politics with Uncle Taufiq? No. Only your uncle was in the underground. Your father wasn't with him. So it's Taufiq's fault. Of course not. Don't forget, Taufiq also suffered terrible losses. It's his fault! His selfishness killed his brother. Now he's dragging us down with the infidels! Please! You are... you're twisting everything. Who's making you think like this? I just know. Don't worry about the lies of time, so long as the rain dances on your tears. Pardon? Just a short verse I once wrote. What's the meaning? The meaning? Don't worry about the lies of time, so long as the rain dances on your tears. Powerful words, Mr Taufiq. Powerful too, were the words you spoke about your brother and your fiancé. What are you saying? You were arrested in '94 for communist activities. Your brother was also arrested, as well as your fiancé. Shortly afterwards you were released but Karim and Haifa died. Says here, you were exchanged in Kurdistan for a high-ranking regime spy. Is it possible you betrayed them to save your own skin? Help us fight the evil. I don't trust him. For such duties, you have to choose the weakest man in the group, so you form a powerful platoon. If I were you, I would have killed him. I worry more for Muhanad than for myself. Good, then do something about it! You're all full of leftist slogans, but nobody actually does anything. "Free country, free people!" You've grown old and your slogans have grown old. There are better slogans today: "With peace or munition, put resistance in position, no state, no god, no motherland, common sense is in your hand." Enough! We get it. I will call Muhanad. Where was Nasseer when you were following Amal through the park. -Nasseer wasn't there. -We have witnesses. I didn't see him. Yasin provoked your nephew to such an extent that he was willing to use violence against you and your friends. No, never. Then explain to us how your nephew's fingerprints were found on the handle of the knife. What's your theory? -Zeki? -Where are you? -I'm with Sven. -Very good. We have to talk. Yasin and his followers are looking for you. Come to the cafe! Thanks for calling. We're on our way. Wait! Be fast, strike hard and don't get caught! God be with you! At least I get to finally meet your people. Come on! It's closing time. Be careful now, try not to be sarcastic. Just watch out. Shit! -Muhanad and Sven! -Open the door, let them in! Guys come on! Quickly! Come in! Come on, Zeki! Take the benches, build a barricade! Amal, Muhanad and his friend must leave! We're staying with you! What's wrong with you? -Give us the homo! -What the fuck? They have to give us the adulterator. Get out of here! Take Amal and leave! Death to the homo! Death to the adulterator! Call the police. Run! Amal! Go to Martin's! If I had my AK-47, I would take you down! I'll get you homo! A kalashnikov? No, not you, sorry, no! Bring him! Bring him out! -Everything's okay. -And Amal? Shes gone to Martin's. Nasseer? Where are you going? -She's in trouble. We have to help. -Are you mad? Will you help? To the front! You bastards! Go home to your mothers! -Yeah, see it burn! -Yeah, lets get out of here. You are against people like Yasin. We are too. If you tell us the truth, then we can arrest Yasin for incitement to murder and put him behind bars for a long time. Nasseer? Is that you? Death to the infidel! No, Nasseer! You were such a good boy. Call the ambulance! Call the ambulance! Stay with me! He betrayed your father. Kill them both! Don't believe him! He's a liar! Please, Taufiq, think it over. With this statement, the prosecutor can charge you manslaughter. You are the only witness who can state that Nasseer was the one who stabbed Amal. That will enable us to charge Yasin with incitement to murder. My nephew was not in the park in that night. Can I go now? Your warrant. Taufiq Jasim, you are under arrest for the murder of Ahmed Kamal. You have the right to remain silent... I'm sorry, Maha. Forgive me. Darkness. Why is it so dark? Am I dreaming? Martin? Martin? Are you here? Are you with me? It's so dark. Wish you would be with me. Are you? I had a dream. I saw us all in Zekis cafe. We were rebuilding it. Samira, excited as usual. And I got to know Muhanads lover, very handsome... And Maud. Martin, I really miss you. I know one day we will have a lot of children, they will have a dark skin and curly hair and some of them will look like you. We shall live all over the world and one day I will be able to show you my beautiful Baghdad. The Tigris, the gardens of Abu Nawas and Keradah, my favourite, where you can see the youngsters in the cafe disputing, arguing, but there will be no fear. And nobody will judge us for who we are.
