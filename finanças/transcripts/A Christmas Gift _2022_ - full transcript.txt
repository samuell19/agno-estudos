What is that? Hey, what the hell is that? Are you crazy? - Uh... - Gimme that! You know you ain't supposed to be up there. I know. Oh my God. I promised the church a few dozen cookies for the community event. - Yeah? - Yeah. Really, Roz? Uh... Does that look like cookies, huh? Well I may have had a slight craving. Oh my God, what is that? Ugh! It's a surprise. Is that peanut butter? Mm-hmm. You know that's not good for the baby. I know. You are tripping. Upstairs, let's go. I just need you to get off of that laptop. Do you plan on working through the entire weekend? No. Actually, I'm officially wrapped. Your boo-thing is here all day, every day, to be your man servant. - You promise? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay, baby. Well, good, because I could use some help. - Well, good. - Guess I can. - You got it? - Mm-hm. I'm here, baby. Which one? The cheetah one. Okay. You're looking like a little sexy, pregnant, jungle cat. Yeah, growl your butt up into bed. Just tell me what you need, baby, I'm here. Ooh, what I don't need is the question. Let's see, I have to go grocery shopping for Christmas dinner. I have to prep the house for family. I have to prep the baby's room. The doula sent over a last minute list for the home birth, and that comes with a side of pushing out a whole human being! Pssh, well, that's a- - Ooh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that? You good? Oh. Just a little gas. Baby, did you just poot on me? Nah, I pooted on my side. Nasty Nasty on my side. But I still think that you're stressing yourself out a little too much. Dalton. No, don't you Dalton me, 'cause you already know what the doctor said. You gotta watch your cortisol levels, and this is the last stretch so, you're supposed to be relaxing, right? Yeah, but how am I supposed to do that? There's so much to do, and who's gonna do it? Who? You and Esta? Yeah, duh! The last time I had you two make cookies, they were so hard Pete chipped his tooth and he never forgot about that. Pssh, don't nobody care about no Pete. And whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My cookies are way better than that nasty grilled, charbroiled cheese mess that you had down there! I'm gonna make another one. You almost burned the house down! You're so dramatic. And now you see. Now you see, I told you it was the oven. It wasn't me, I didn't mess up the cookies. Oh, it was the oven? It was the oven. No, no, no, no, it was the game. Was the game in the oven? You were paying attention to the game more than you were paying attention to the oven. Okay, the game. Yeah, so? Now, if we put the game in the oven, maybe the cookies would've turned out softer. Put the game in the oven? So yeah I watched the game, so? - Okay. - Forget that. Are you trying to say that I can't cook? No, you can't! Are you saying that I can't cook? You cannot. And now I'm known as the woman who makes concrete cookies. Aw, baby! I love your cookies. I know you do. That's how we got here. But I still think you're stressing yourself too much. You know, you be doing too much. Overexerting. I have people depending on me. I'm not worried about people. You're the only person I'm worried about, and my son getting here safely and healthy. 'Cause if my boy come out with 20 toes, I'm telling you, I am gonna rough you up, girl. Your baby's not gonna come out with 20 toes, Dalton. So what do you suggest? This weekend, anything that doesn't involve you or this baby, we need to scrap it. Wait, are you saying we cancel Christmas? Bingo. - No. - You said it. Dalton, no, no, no. No, you said it, not me. No, my mom and sister are looking forward to coming here, and as annoying as your brothers are, they are too. Dalton! Girl, do I look like Santa Claus? And do you look like Mrs. Claus? No. So their Christmas does not revolve around us. - Dalton, stop. - Uh-uh. - Give me the phone! - Watch this. Stop! And... Boom, just like that. Christmas at the McKenzie house is canceled, baby. Ho, ho, ho. You really did that? Yeah, now you can relax. Wow! - See? - I'm going to sleep. Whoa. And you are banned for my dreams tonight! Give me the covers. Wow, really? That's what we doing? Mhhmm, yes. Cold-blooded people don't need blankets anyway. Cold-blooded? Wait wait, I thought you was gonna give me some- - Ah, no. No jungle love? Don't touch me. No jungle love. Anyway. Okay, that's what we doing? Yup. That's how you gonna... All right, what what... All right, well goodnight. Goodnight. Wow. Okay, fine, it's settled. We both like mint chocolate chip ice cream, and you have to promise me you'll buy me some one time. Esta? Who were you talking to? What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm talking about on the phone, Esta. Nobody. Oh, yeah, nobody. I got my eye on you. So have you thought about what we talked about? Yeah, I have. Well? Well, I'm still thinking about it. But truthfully it's probably gonna be a hard no. Dad! Esta! What do you mean? First it was basketball, then it was gymnastics. Now you're telling me you wanna play golf? What's gonna be next? I mean, isn't the whole point of childhood trying to figure out new things and see what you're good at? That's all I'm trying to do. Yeah, I mean, I love that about you. But it seems that you're more addicted to the opportunities and allergic to the work. I mean that, baby. You keep taking up all these new hobbies, and as soon as it gets a little rough for you, you drop it and go to the next thing. How will you ever know what you're actually good at if you don't stick at it for longer than two months? Come on. Look, I know it's expensive. But I did the research, and I really think I'll be good at it. Baby, of course you're going to be good at it. You're a McKenzie. Good! So then you'll pay for the lessons? No, I won't. Come on, Esta, you're all over the place. What's up with you? Come on, dad. Oh my God, all right. Let's make a deal, all right? How about you take a break so you can regroup and recenter? As soon as you're ready, I want you to write me a essay about how bad you want to take up golf, yeah, and all this new research that you done came up with. And after I read it, then I'll make my decision. Geez, a whole essay? Yeah. And as a matter of fact, I wanna hear about who your favorite golfer is too. You're wild, Dad. But okay, deal. Okay, good, that's my girl. So, since we're at the bargaining table here, you think you might lower the age I'm allowed to start dating? Dating? Man, wait, what? No! No, no, no, no! Boys, I told you. Books before boys! Okay, always. Dad! Dad my butt, girl! If you don't go downstairs and get some breakfast. Matter of fact, breakfast before boys in this house. Come on, let's go. Not funny. No, it's funny all right. Talking about some boys. Pssh! Lord. My baby's growing up too fast. Really? You eating tarts for breakfast? You know the deal. Good morning. Good morning. Did you oversleep? Not really. Just had to thaw out a little bit. It's a cold world. Hm, who are you telling? What are you doing, what you got going on? Oh, just organizing some of my thoughts. Which reminds me, can you put the baby's crib together today? And run some of the errands we talked about last night? Turning me into your little slave, ain't you? What, I'm just playing. You know I will do whatever you want me to. I appreciate you. I appreciate you. Mm little baby mama. And on that note, I'm taking my breakfast upstairs. Oh, you don't like that? I thought that's what you said you wanted, huh? Wanted? What did I miss? Trust me boo, you do not wanna know. But, I'm gonna take this time to apologize to you for all that from last night. Oh, did you have a change of heart? No, I didn't. But, this ain't a dictatorship, it's a relationship. You're my partner, right? So your opinion matters. Plus I responded like a jerk. And I'm not a jerk, so this is me apologizing, right? Yeah, about that. I need to tell you something. What? Who the hell is that? You expecting somebody? Uh-uh. Knocking on my door like the police. Who is it? Merry Christmas! Here you are honey. And how are you? Look at you, Oh my goodness. So cold outside. Sweetheart! Oh my God, look at this tree. Oh my God look at this. Great! Oh we made it, we made it Mama. Yes we did. Look, she looks like she's about to pop. What the hell are y'all doing here? Dalton, let the kid stop playing. Yeah, I told them about the mistake, that it was a mistake. - Oh, a mistake. - Oh, what? Anyway, this place looks amazing. It looks great, it looks amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Dalton. Oh gosh, you're so sweet, honey. Oh my goodness! - Oh gosh, yeah, yeah. - Come on baby, come on, get your sister. Oh, my goodness, looks good in here. Man! Who is it? Hey! Hey. What's up, Big D. Yeah, my man. What's going on, big bro? How you doing in here? What the hell is y'all doing here, man? Damn, we got your text. Yeah, you got the text, right? You got the text? Yeah. You can't make up your mind, is it Christmas or it's not Christmas? All right, yeah man. Merry Christmas. You know what I'm saying- - Since you ain't come empty handed. - Yeah bro. - Damn. Did you cook? Yeah, I hope you least got some snacks. - Yeah, take this- - Come on bro, I'm gonna take this in there. I'm gonna take my coat off man. Good to see you baby bro. Hey. Hey, what it do? You know what it is. I had some sweet tea on the drive- - Yeah. You gotta drop him off? Yeah. Do I? Where is it at, is it upstairs? I'll go upstairs. To the right. Hey! Anybody else outs... I can't believe this, man. Really? Shit bro. What's going on? It's about time you joined us. Whatever. Had to finish being somebody's little concierge/personal servant. Mh-hmm, I see you still got your sense of humor. How you doing, brother-in-law? I'm good, Lisa, Lisa. What's up with you? Bro has told me you got that new hair salon, how's that going for you? Well, it's going real good. Oh good. Just don't be one of those salons that expect you to come with your hair half done, before you sit in the chair. Aren't those the worst? - Yes. - They expect you to come de-tangled, washed, dried, that's why I just went natural. And they want you to bring the products? Oh, I don't think so. Y'all know that's not gonna be in my salon, all right? Every style comes with a shampoo and a conditioner, that's ridiculous. Good. That is fascinating. You're still seeing that loser boyfriend? Why you stay in my business? I only asked a question. Okay, don't start you two. You already know I ain't paying him no attention. Hey, everybody. Hey, hi, honey. Keep going girl, come on. You kinda getting a little big. Esta, come here. Oh, my goodness. She's a grown woman now. It's good to see you. Get out of here, girl. You're so big. She's beautiful, I bet the boys are lining up to see you, honey. I hope dad's gonna help me. Hey, hey, hey, watch it. Uh-uh, I know you're not gonna be that way with your son, double standard. Double standards? I know when my little brother and he's probably gonna treat him the same way he does our dear Esta. Exactly. Get all this double standard crap. Since you two fools done showed up at my house, I got a crib upstairs that I gotta build. Y'all go help me build it. No, no, no, no. For real? I'm a guest and I'm eating breakfast. You ain't no guest, you're a crasher. And if you gonna be eating my food and sleeping in my house, you about to help me build this crib. So, get up, let's get it. Uh-uh, I'm deadass serious, come on. Mh, let's go. Y'all ready? Bring it back with you if you want, I don't care. Oh, I see you, gonna talk about the double standard? Now there has come a time to do it. Yeah, don't worry about it, we'll have cold beers for y'all to keep you hydrated while you. Just grab some beers. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait not you, young lady. You're on cookie duty, you have to help bake, remember? I thought grandma and Auntie Lisa were helping you now. Girl, you thought wrong. Not to make the cookies. No getting out of here. All right. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Good girl. Now that we have that settled, let me show you ladies the rest of the house. Okay, whatever. - Be careful. - Okay. I can't wait. Be careful. Be careful. I know mama. Oh, please. You look good, except for that hat though. Honey, this isn't a hat, this is sable. You know, and we need to get you this- - You're sister still wearing that hat in the house. Yeah. Hello? Yeah, I can't come. My mom needs me to do something. I tried but I mean, what am I supposed to do, sneak out? I can't do that, I'll get in so much trouble. Okay, okay fine. I'm coming. I just, I can't be long. Okay, bye. See you in a bit. ♪ Jingle bells ♪ Jingle bells ♪ Jingle all the way How do you cut these things? Why did I keep telling you? You cut onions under running water. Mama, you now how hardheaded Lisa, is. You can tell her how to do something a million times, she's still gonna do what she wants to do. True. Um, I can, I can hear y'all. We know. Speaking of hardheaded, are you still with Brandon? Don't get started with me guys, don't get started with me. I'm just saying, Lisa, you used to be smiling and laughing all the time, hanging out with your friends. I don't want him to change you. You're just so dramatic. Nobody is changing anybody, I'm fine. You're fine? Yes, I'm fine. Fine? Yes, fine. Does he have a new job or is he still asking you for money? You know what? How about we stop talking about me and mine. And we talk about you and yours. Yeah. Oh, what about us? Mama, not you too. Well, since your sister brought it up, I'm curious too. I mean, after all the last time we saw you two together, you were divorced and now you're living in this big house and you're expecting a baby. Do you plan on remarrying, I hope? It's complicated. Make it uncomplicated, honey. Please simplify it for mother because I hope Dalton doesn't expect to get the milk for free without buying the cow. Moo-moo. Not that it's any of your business. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, wait, mama, she said get out of her business is what the girl said, get off frustrated and get into a car, mama, that's what she said. Oh, come on. Lisa, seriously Lisa? All right, all right. Lisa, why do you always have to put so much sauce everything. Okay, respectfully, mama. That's better. A few months ago, Dalton did ask me to remarry him. What! Come on now. I said, no. You said what? I said, no. Honey, have you lost your natural mind? No. Okay. Okay, let's just start. Honey, Dalton happens to be my favorite, I'm sorry Lisa. 'Cause the Tony with the double boot, is a no go. It was Brandon's Miles. Okay, Brandon, Tony, whatever, he had a double boot on the car. Yeah. This is not a big deal, but it was Brandon. Honey, listen, he's my favorite. I could see how he loves you, I could see it in his eyes, honey. A mother knows. And it's hard to find a good man. And when you find one, you've gotta hold on tight. You gotta hold on, you've gotta hold on. Grip it. Because otherwise you can let him loose out there, anybody gonna snatch him up? Can't have these good men out there. But that is so old school, Dalton and I are taking it slow. I don't see the slow in any of this. The big house, the baby coming. My grandchild- Doesn't look slow to me, you know, with those glasses really? Mama. Huh? Our lives, our business. - Oh, oh. - Oh, shit. Well, it seems to me you wouldn't know what came before us if it stared you in the eye. But I understand you young girls today, Lisa, the cookies are on. Oh no, Esta's doing the cookie. Mama, don't take it out on your own daughter. She said out my business. Imagine, imagine that. Can I say, get out my business. She said- Exactly. It's not funny. I'm sorry, she left us. So, she said taking slow is being nine months pregnant. You know what man, this is ridiculous, man. You would think that after you'd have been around the block a few times, putting together a crib, be a piece of cake. I'm telling you, bro, yeah. I do not remember this being that hard the first time around. Man, I think it's adrenaline problem. Why do they just want your adrenaline to kick in, you know, nothing seems hard when it's new and exciting, you see? Yeah bro, you got a point. Yeah man, I'm trying to tell you bro. Jobs, kids, relationships, everything. Everything seems easy when it's new. You speaking facts today. Yes sir. Big bro, let me see that other screwdriver order, man. There you go. Swap me up. Yeah. Hey man, just wanna say, I really like what you y'all are building right here. You know, this house is beautiful and your family is too. We've got an imposter, where's the real Dalton. What? Don't take unless you're getting soft on us now, bro? What's up? I mean, maybe. Dalton, look, I see what you and Roz have. And Pete, what you and Claire had, and God rest her soul. I don't know, I'm feeling like I want that for myself now. Really? Yeah, really. That's how you are feeling. That's right. Go check that window, I guarantee it's a blizzard outside. The most selling dad. He'll just freeze over. Okay, yeah. Look, I know it sounds crazy, right? I'm just thinking about things right now. I'm out there right now and the streets are like, they got nothing for you. It's just time. Okay. All right. New and improved, damn. So, seeing somebody or what? Yeah, nobody serious. I see. It's time for me to get focused. Hey look, the game out there is crazy. It's all about swipes and DMS and taking more pictures of your food than actually eating it. Surveillance video, Snapgram, y'all been on that one. Snap the gram? Bro, that's two different apps, you just put 'em together like crazy dudes. Snap. No, wait, well hold on. Whoa, you said surveillance, who are you dating bro? A damn undercover cop? I might as well be. Look, you can't go to brunch without them recording your every single move. It's like the only reason they're on the date is to log on and compete with other people who are also on dates. It's crazy. It's like, here we are, here we are. Come on. Okay. I mean, are you actually interested in me? Am I just there basically to help you make content for your page. Just tell me. Facts though. I mean, I get it, you make sense. I just want some real conversation. Talk to me, ask me about my day. Ask me about my thoughts on our people and how we're striving and thriving in America. Stop asking me, what kind of job you got? Is your bed up against the wall? What kind of headboard do you have? A headboard? Who are you dating? Yeah, who are you dating bro? But now I- You getting to my point? No, I get your point, man. Look, I would prefer to have brains and beauty. So, yeah, I get. Exactly. Look, I've had it all. And the stuff that used to excite me just doesn't anymore. I mean, I'm at a place now where I don't know, not looking for sex, looking for thoughtful. It's just not as easy to find as it seems. Get the ham and the both. Thick and thoughtful. Thick and thoughtful. Yeah. Cakes matter. Look man, when I first met Clara. Yeah, I don't think I was 100% ready to be honest. It was something about her, she had this quality that I knew I just did not wanna lose. Decided to marry her, best thing I could ever done. Yeah. And look, she was a great woman, man, and that's for sure. Yeah. Thanks man. Yeah, it was... Together what, 20 years. Yeah. If I had to do that all over again, the exact same way I would. I miss seeing y'all together, man. To hell with cancer. No, man. The hell with cancer my man. You know, she fought that good fight though. It's a good thing that we didn't leave anything I'd say. I'm grateful for that, my soul's is in peace. It's all done. Mh-hmm. Now lets talk about you, Mr. Dalton. Mm-hmm. Yeah. How about you, Mr. Dalton? You and Roz have gotten back together for a reason. You're gonna work out, everything's gonna be fine, but let me give you a little word of advice. Don't let it go. Don't compromise, no matter what, hold onto it. You hear me? I'm listening. Hold on. If it was up to me bro, we wouldn't have broken up in the first place. I hear you. She probably left you 'cause you got a flathead screwdrivers. Can I get a fill up something here, bro? Who gets drunk with a flat head. It's not the screwdriver man. We'll need the pliers to hold the both down. I gotta get to the garage. Well, okay. I'll be back. Yeah, of course. Let me go get it. You got us doing the work, this ain't my crib. I ain't got no babies, we put a crib together in like 20 years, man. Tag on instructions bro, I don't know what this thing is. If the baby fall, I'm blaming you. That's what I just saw on YouTube. Where did I put that thing? Yeah. Yeah, what are you doing? Uh-uh, and you better not lie to me little girl. I can explain. Well, get to explain it 'cause you ain't said nothing yet. Uh-uh, what you hiding behind your back? Where did you get that gift from? Well, this guy wanted me to meet him somewhere. Him? Who is him, Esta? Well, my boyfriend. Your boyfriend. I thought we already agreed. No boyfriends, Esta. You're too young. But dad, I'm about to be a junior in a few months. I can handle this and school, I'm not a little baby anymore. Oh you can handle it, huh? Ever since you've been talking about this little boyfriend, you've been less than honest and you've sure done lost focus, and now you sneaking around in my house. I don't like that, I didn't raise you like this, Esta. Well, dad, I didn't mean to sneak around. I just knew that if I'd asked you for him to come here, you wouldn't allow him to come. So, why did you do it, huh? Why did you do it then? Well, I'm sorry dad. Well, I'm sorry too, okay. No, look at me. Look, I want you to feel comfortable that you can come to me about anything, all right? Whether I agree with you or not. Okay? I'm sorry dad. And I won't ever do this again, I promise. Yeah, you better not. Look, I can't even believe I'm about to say this, but I will entertain the little thought of you having a boyfriend. You will? Only if I approve of him. So, before you meet up with him again, you need to introduce him to me. Okay, the right way. How about on Christmas? Yeah, that's for sure. I will meet your little punk boyfriend on Christmas Day, okay? All right, cool. Thank you dad. - Girl, I swear- - There you are. Where have you been? I've been looking for you for over an hour? You know- - She was upstairs with us, helping with the crib and the baby room. Well I need you downstairs, not upstairs on crib duty. You're gonna be up all night if you don't get started soon, come on. - Yes. - Yes, mom, I will get started right away. Listen to your mama. And Dalton, the store. It's Christmas Eve, it may close early, I need you to go. Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot. You said you was gonna give me the list. I'll text you, you think you can manage? Girl, I done went to the store for you before, you taught me better than that. I did, didn't I? Yeah. Okay, get to it. Girl,. Y'all still in here struggling, ain't y'all? Look, wife said I gotta go to the store for a minute. So, I brought the tools. Can y'all please finish the crib for me, man? Isn't that convenient? - Yeah, I'm saying- - Please? Do that for your brother, man. I'll be right back. And he walks out. Okay. Just like his dad. That's your brother. Hi honey. Mind if I come in? You don't even have to ask, come on. Oh my goodness. Oh, my feet could use some TLC right about now. You can use it next. No, you need it more than me, baby. So, are you ready? More than you know? Oh, I know. Trust. How you holding up? Well, now that I'm face to face with you, I'm just fine. Yes. I told you not to worry about me. You tried doing that, I'm your mother. You know, I have to say it, but last year it was such a challenging year for you, with the divorce, and I hated that- - Oh, mama. - I couldn't be here, for what? I was fine. I needed the alone time. It worked out well though. Oh it did. You know, you and Dalton remind me so much of me and your father. Yeah? How so? Well, let's see where do I start. When I was your age, I was very ambitious. Oh, when I was headstrong and your father hated it most of the time, because my decisions were not always right. Yeah, but you stuck around though, right? Because I'm an excellent cook. You are. But seriously, I don't know if I ever told you this, but daddy threatened to leave a number of times. And then one day he actually did. What? Dad left? Yeah. He packed up his old leather bag and he got himself a hotel room. And you know, I just thought I was gonna just wait it out, but no, in those few weeks that your father was gone, I learned that life wasn't worth living without him. Just wasn't worth it, it wasn't worth being right all the time. What are you trying to tell me? Honey, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. I'm just sharing a story about how I almost lost what mattered most. And I didn't need to be in control. Wow. Listen, I'm gonna get some rest before this dinner and we're gonna have to deal with the crazy Pete. And his mouth and Esta's ears, my goodness. I'm glad you came up. Me too, I want what's best for you, honey. I love you. I love you. And that grandbaby growing every day. Isn't he? Okay. Bye. Bye. Yeah, you know, I want to man, but I can't because of the baby and all that. Look, trust me, I know I said that last year, but look, this year we gonna make it happen, all right? The whole family. Hold on, man. I gotta call you back bro. Hey, let me help you with this. No, no, no, no. It's all good. Here! You ain't gotta do that. No, no, trust me. The struggle is real. Yes it is, yes it is. Let me guess your wife sent you on a store. Is it that obvious? Yeah, just a little. Yeah. But I get it though, we've all been there. That's why you here too? Actually I lost my wife some time ago. Oh, I'm sorry man, I didn't know. No, no, no reason to feel sorry, she's in a better place now. But so every Christmas, I try to remake her corn, Casaro. Doesn't always turn out as good as hers, but it always reminds me of the good times. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I bet it does. No, nowadays families are so distant with each other, it's not always my choice. See, life goes on, we create our own families, or as people pass away, we just fellowship less and less. It's like for that life to get in the way of a connection. That's right. No, it's funny that you say that, I literally was just talking to my cousin on the phone. You know, family hadn't been together a long time. Everybody's all spread out. Time is never just right. Yeah, yeah, I know. Trust me, I know. And you just can't please everyone. Facts, facts. Finally somebody who gets it. But I'd like to say that, if you are blessed to have family that still have air in their lungs, love on them, fellowship with them, no matter what life throws at you, always make time for your own. 'Cause there will be a day and there's no time left. So, you have to create those memories now. Yes, sir. Sorry man, I gotta get back to the wife man. - Oh, yeah. - So I'll keep going. Thank you for that word. Yeah, you're welcome. You have a Merry Christmas, man. You too. I'll go on. Take care, Dalton. Man, I must be sleep deprived, I'm tripping. Fill me up, give me some more. Mama did her thing. Did she? Listen, for the last time, you do not put sugar in grits, period. No, hold up. You don't know what you're missing. Oh, I know exactly what I'm missing and I'm fine with that. Miss me all the way. Everybody, butter, salt and pepper, that's it. You probably think spaghetti is an entree too? Yes, spaghetti's a full and delicious meal. Hey, well hold on. I'm coming to my brother defense now. - What. - Thank you. Depends on where you travel, some places consider spaghetti a side. Yes, Pam was on fire, fish baby. Well then, depending on where you go, macaroni and cheese is also an entree, that don't make it right. But how did this even become a topic? You Roz, when you threatened to poison us with your sugar regrets. Oh no. Poison. - Poisons? - Okay. Oh no, he didn't. No, he didn't. I remember when your big mama used to wake the house up with her grits, the eggs, the bacons. Yeah, the bacon and pork, man, you gotta add fried now. Lord, I wish I could wake up to some bacon now. Oh. Only thing I'm waking up to is vegan, frosted flakes and some damn almond milk. Okay, Dalton, whatever. It's good for you. I'm not a vegan. It's healthier for you. A little plant based vibes never killed anybody. What? Actually that's not true because cardboard is also plant based. Help me, please help me. You are so chaotic tonight. I cook, okay? I just threw down in the kitchen the other day, all by myself. She almost burnt the house. Hey, Uh-uh. Then She said, look, smoke everything. Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me you are over here like a cave man, and you just want your woman barefoot and pregnant and waiting on you here, the fuck bro. No, come on now, bro, come on now. Whoa, slow down sis, don't do me like that. You know how I feel about my- - Hey, look D, I'm with you man. That's how it is, the 50/50 always. No in my house, ain't no 50/50, bro. Everybody holds their own weight 100%. 100%, boo-yah. A hundred on Roz. Honey, I know I've asked you this 1,000 times, but I know you're excited about the baby coming around the corner. So, tell me again, when's the due date? Next week and it can't come fast enough. I feel like there's an alien invasion in my body. I want it out. I like you pregnant. It will all come back together, but when's the doula coming? Oh, well, what's the heck is a doula. She helps the midwife fool. What's a midwife? Don't worry about it, just... - I actually- - I don't know you. The doula helps keep me calm and relaxed. It's the midwife who will help me give birth right here at home. And don't worry mama, she'll keep me safe through the entire process. All right. She's out of town this weekend for Christmas, but she'll be back in time for me to go into labor. Well, look, my hats off to all the ladies, because that sounds way too complicated for me. Yes, bringing a baby into the world is such a blessing, it's of no understanding. And then you feel that baby going inside of you, and then it takes its first breath. It's so surreal. And that's how me and Claire felt, went on our first child. I don't know if I remember, I was like on sensory overload. I thought I was gonna pass the hell out, man. I was there. We still got that on tape, man. You know, it's crazy. Remember that? First one, we'll do it. Yeah, the first one. Yeah, so, for the life of you me then, why are you having the baby here at the house? When you can have the baby at the hospital like everybody else? I don't wanna have it in the hospital during the holidays, like everybody else. Mama I wanna be sleeping right here on my own bed. Well, what if the baby stand? But what if the baby comes pretty early, like at the dinner table. We are blessed and covered up in this house. Yeah, thank you. And plus mama's a doctor, she can... Whoa, whoa, whoa. I am retired. I have delivered enough babies to last me a lifetime. I have no intention of delivering another baby, even if it is my grandson, I'm sorry. Well, mama, you won't have to. Esta came out late and this little guy will probably be the same way. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't be trying to text me up man That no wood. Wait, be careful man, knocking at wood, man. You don't know what kind of spirits you gonna conjure up doing that. Careful. Get outta here with that superstitious crap, I don't believe in that voodoo mumbo jumbo man. Okay, man. Your house, your ghost. So, now we gotta go. Correct. Here it goes. So, tell me is your boy toy feeling lonely again? You know I, I swear that just must be some type of condition for you to just not be able to mind your own business. You know, you should seek help. And maybe you should stop trolling rap concerts, looking for love. Get you a real man, you know one that doesn't bank on the Cash App. Oh my, uh-oh... A real man? - Yeah. - Like you? A washed up athlete, still living vicariously through his Michigan days falsely believing that 40 is the new 30. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guess what? It's not. Bro, you're gonna let her talk to you like that? Roz is having a baby, insults are out of the way. How about some dessert? Dessert? You know what? I'll take some pie, just pass that along. We need some sweetness going on at. 40 is the new 30. That's what I'm saying. You still got it. I never lost it bruh. You're not listening. Home made, mama? Why am I not surprised you would be down here hauling up all the good snacks. Why am I not surprised your hound senses could sniff them out. Ooh. Care to play? Ladies thirst. But hey, hey... Let me show you what it is- Wow, so they didn't teach you how to share in grade school either. Maybe, maybe not. Let me show you what to do, and watch it. Aim for the middle. Shut up. Come out of my way. I hate this game. Yeah, I hate you too. Shut up. Let me ask you a question? Shoot. What do you think about our siblings getting back together again after you know? Honestly? No, lie to me. Okay, you still got it Lisa. One point for Lisa. Yeah, a point for Lisa. Look, so you wanna disrespect me in front of the family, and now you want my opinion? I'm sorry. Well, here it is. I don't think about it. Roz is a great woman and my brother's a decent guy. That's it. I mean, but is that good enough reason for them to get back together again after they separated though? They didn't separate Lisa, they got divorced. Same thing, you know what I mean, No. They're not married anymore. No. Look, I get you, but I don't get you. Listen, from what I know, they didn't split up over some disrespect or craziness. No. They just went on the same page, that's it? You know, sometimes things have to fall apart to get put back together the way they should have been, it's life. I guess you're right. Everybody loves a good comeback story. Yeah, especially me. Speaking of which. Ooh, trash, trash, I'm watching trash. Why is it so windy out here? I just, wow. Move, move, move. Just so you know, the circle in the middle is where you wanna be. Shut up. I need quiet, I need quiet. Quick, so. I'm so sick of you right now. I mean that counts, but only if you're in Canada. Here we go, watch this bullseye. It hit the bullseye. - It's fine, it's fine. - It totally hit the bullseye. And then it bounced off. Can I say something? I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. Don't tell nobody. I couldn't hear you over the slow. What? I said, I'm sorry. I was a little extra at dinner. A little bit. But you be on my neck though, you be right here on my neck. Okay, I was a little forward. A little, a little? Ashamed. Walked out through the door, as soon as we walked through the door, you were like, yo, what you doing with your man? What it is? You got your attitude. Okay, like, you sometimes just, you know, bring it out. Well, I'm sorry. You just pushed my buttons just a little bit, but I shouldn't have did that at dinner. I'm sorry, I was out of line. You know the funny thing, kind of pushed mine too. So, call it even? Now, that's out of the way, watch this. Trash. I say the blue, definitely the blue. You think so? Mm-hmm. And you know what else I think? What? I think that this would go perfect with that. Wow. You're right. Mh-hmm. I can wear this tomorrow? You can do more than wear it, you can have it. Really? Yes, really. Thank you. Now, hold on. This isn't in the place of my Christmas gift. Is it? Oh girl, and if it was? You just playing, right? I don't know baby, I don't know. So, what's going on with you? Something is different about you. What do you mean? I know that look from anywhere, you more particular about your clothes, you sneaking off at all hours. Who told you that? Look, you can't slick a can of all young lady. Remember I used to be your age once. Now, who is he? Is it that obvious? Yes, actually it is now dish, tell me. Okay, okay. My boyfriend, his name is Brian. Oh, okay, Brian. And how long you've been seeing Brian? Long enough. Okay. And how does Brian treat you? Like a princess. And do princesses sneak off in the middle of the moon? I mean, hello, Romeo and Juliet. And we see how that turned out. Look, my only advice to you is just don't lose sight of who your parents raised you to be and you'll be okay. I like that, auntie. I really do. Good. Good, I'm pooped. A hot shower and warm cups as I call in my name, Lisa. Now, don't stay up too late now, all right? I won't. Good. And another thing, have y'all kissed? Ew, no, no Well, good, keep it that way. Really? Nah, it just sounded like the right thing to say. Good night, girlie. Good night. I love you. I love you too. What are you still doing up? Can't sleep. Plus there's gifts that still need wrapping soon. Today was good, huh? Yeah. You know, it went a lot smoother than I thought. I mean, we had a few bumps along the way, but it wasn't nothing major. Tim and Lisa. - Yeah. - What are we gonna do with those two? They've been at each other's throats since they met. If I didn't know any better, I'd think... Uh-uh. No, I can't. I don't even want that vision in my head. Gross. What about her situation though? You think she's gonna be all right. If I were a betting woman, I'd say she'll figure it out in her own time. No better than me. So, how was the catching up with your mom today? It's great, actually. She's still applying the pressure for us to get married again. That's crazy, right? What's so crazy about that? Dalton, come on. What do you mean, come on? We talked about this. No, we didn't. If I recall, I asked you to marry me again and you turned me down. That doesn't really sound much like a discussion does it? That's not fair, I just said not right now. Okay, then when? Dalton, can we not do this right now? Do what? This. All right, what is it, Roz? Are you scared of me? Or are you scared of us? What? It's everything. Look, the first time I thought we'd be together forever, and look how that turned out. Dalton, that was painful. I don't wanna go through that again. Hold on. If I recall, you left me Roz, you do remember that, right? Yeah, but you didn't fight for me. You just walked away, like that's what you wanted all along. No, it wasn't like that, come on. Even if that's true, which is debatable, say we do get married again, right? And we get Esta's hopes up, and my hopes up, and you wake up one morning, just resenting me and realizing this isn't what you really wanted. I mean, you're pregnant with my son, you're the mother of my child. What about this, could I not want? You act like we planned this. This wasn't planned, we're two people who went too far one night over some tequila and here we are. Wow. Really? Dalton, I didn't mean it like that. Just drop it, okay? For the last time I'm with my family, I'm not out here partying and carrying on, it's not that type of truth. Look, if I didn't answer the phone, it's because I'm busy. All right, I'm not your answer machine that's available for you 24/7. I not trying to get smart. Like, I'm here now, what do you need? How much, Brandon? Brandon, I just gave you near that amount a couple of weeks ago and I never got it back. Hell, what do I look like ATM to you? No. I get the crypto, maybe the next best thing, and I am all for you investing in it with your own damn money. No, I didn't... Brandon? Hello? Bran... No, he didn't. Ooh, you got it? Yeah. Girl, Esta did her job on these cookies, I don't even know what this is. Is it Macadamian nuts and chocolate chips or what is that? I love it when she put those chunks in it, those chunks and girl last she's gotten so much better than last year. 'Cause last year, girl, the chips were so hard. Are you okay? Me? Yeah. Yeah, why? Oh no, you just seem, you just seem different. Are we making a mistake? You picked a fine time to ask that question, when the baby about to pop out. Look, I'm sorry. I just don't understand What scares you so much about this? You wouldn't understand. Oh, because I'm not married, I don't have any common sense. Girl, a blind man can see that Dalton is a good man. You know, do you need your vision checked? No, Lisa, I didn't mean it like that. I know Dalton is a good man, I don't need my vision checked. He just feels... What, it feels too good to be true? Yes. You left him, remember? Hell, he never would've left, if you hadn't pushed him away. Not you too. You are lucky to have a man that cares about you. Not everybody has that. You wouldn't- - Girl, don't mention his name. Why do you put up with that, Lisa? I guess the same reason that Dalton could tell you. The same reason daddy put up with mama? Exactly. Girl, love makes you do some crazy things. Let's get these cookies up in here. Dry your eyes. Okay, we're gonna be going up in this church. You cry in the street, mascara down. Look, on snap gram, you just choose whichever one, you know what I'm saying? Look up. Hey, look at mama has got her present. You can tell this game, you can tell they got his name all over. You see what I'm saying? That's why we stopped doing secret Santa because of his cheating, but do you see that- - Hey, look, that is a piece of art, and it's sad that you came all the way here for that. Anyway, it's Christmas, so can we just move on? Leave me alone. Show me snap the gram. Oh, look here, hold on. Hey dad. Hey baby. So, I wrote my essay on why I wanted to play golf. Your essay, right? Let us hear it, go ahead, give us a summary. Dad, just a summary? I wrote this whole thing. Baby, I just wanted you to write it so you would see it through, you know. Remember that work ethic thing I told you about, all right? But we listening, lay it on us. Yeah. Okay, so, when my friends let me tag on the course for a scrabble, I was amazed the amount of people I met and bonded with over the way. I met a member of the commerce, an executive from the top company that offered and gave me a letter of reference if I ever needed it. Really? I'm there. Okay. And so, that's it, that's my reason. Golf is where the deals are made, Dad. You hear that? Yeah, wow. My little baby, a boss in the making. I sure am. And not to mention it's literally so fun, and it gives me access to people I wouldn't, haven't already able to reach, not to mention it's fun. Dad, I really wanna do it. Yeah, I do. Okay, look at me. Tell me about your favorite player. Clemmie Perry, she literally started playing it as a hobby and then noticed the entire sport can use some diversity. She bridged a lot of gaps dad, for girls like me. Girls like you. How about that? I don't know, still on the fence about that golf thing, man. We'll think about it. Pass me that gift. Here, I forgot to give you this. I had to take your mind off that golf stuff. Can I open it? Yeah, open it now. Does this mean... Uh-huh. You're gonna be the best golfer ever. Thank you dad. And you know, I will, 'cause I'm McKenzie. Hey, that's what I'm talking about, just like your uncle Tim, right? Put that McKenzie stink on it. I sure will. Yeah, a little tiger, a little, lady tiger. That's right. Lady Tiger Woods. That's my girl. Who is that? I'll get it. Boy, did you invite one of your little snap the gram girls over here? This the snap gram bro. Pete, get on this.

Oh no, I can't, because you make it so easy. Look, I got your easy, what do you want, it's cold out here. I noticed you're not your normal self, and I don't wanna overstep. Which is exactly what people say right before they do. I overheard your phone call last night. Lisa, why do you fool with that dude, come on. Look, you are too smart and too good of a woman to allow any man to talk to you that way. Oh, you mean the way you talk to me? That's okay though, right? Because we're family. I gotta accept anything you give, nobody else, right? I'm sorry. Look, I'll be the first to admit I'm a little hard on you sometimes. A little. But I see so much potential in you, and you're not gonna reach it fooling with that dude. Look, he's not worth your time, and I think you deserve much better. Look, I know, it's just crazy how you can lose yourself in someone to the point where you just trick your mind into thinking you can do better or survive without him. Lisa, you are a beautiful, intelligent, stubborn, anD ambitious woman and any man would be lucky to have you. If I wasn't your brother brother-in-law. But you are, so, get that outta your mind. Of course, that's what I'm saying, but just imagine all of the other men out there who are just waiting in their lives for a shot with you. It's gonna happen in time, but not until you handle your business. You know what you gotta do, right? Yeah, I know. Thank you. Really, thank you. I have you back, you know that, right? Yeah, whatever. Okay, no, it's cool. Let's go, can we go inside please? You're gonna stop telling me what to do. When you loose, I'll be your problem, come on now. Thank you. No problem. So you did it, you survived my dad. And your uncles. Oh yeah, them too. I should have warned you. Yeah, you let me into the lion's den then with that one. But I enjoyed it. You did? No. See, I knew it. It was intense though. I haven't felt that much trust since the SATs. But I get it, they're just looking out for you. Question is, did I pass the test? Well, I mean, you're still walking on both your legs, so, I'd say yeah, you did. Yeah. I guess you're right. I'm hungry, let's go back inside and get something. Me too, I'm starving. And my grandma's apple pie is no joke. For real? For real, for real. Look, so then he says, he wants to be in tech. Yep, that's good. What's wrong with tech Tim, what's wrong with being in tech. What's wrong with that, Pete? Look, I looked up his stats, I mean, he's pretty good. I think with a little bit of development, he could make the league. That's the thing though. Black men don't have to aspire to play a sport just because they're good at it. Oh, he's right. It's like people telling you, do you play basketball because you're tall? And he's not tall at all. I'm just saying, the height. It's not about me in this moment, I'm just saying. Tim, come on. Listen, Tim you're so damn political. - I'm tired of ball. - In that case, I can't stand you bro. Yep, Brian, man. Look, don't, don't worry about that one there, okay? You'll never win one with that, that's real. So, miss Marie. Yes. I cannot wait to taste your apple pie. The wait is over. That's why I love me some of this. Hey, Pete. But you'd like anybody to feed you. That's true. That's true, that's very, very true. Look, you gotta defend yourself now, player. Yeah. Crazy dude. Serious moment real quick guys. I wanna make a toast. All right. Because we almost didn't come together this week. Um, because of who I wanted. All right, that's on me, that's my bad. But honestly, I'm glad that all of you made it, because I love you, you're my family, and we're nothing without family, we're nothing without love. So, raise your glasses and let's pray that we never have to wait this long to be together again. All right, family. Family. My man. Church call. Mh-hmm. I love y'all, man. Oh, it's all back to you brother. Since we're all here together, I would like to say family is love and I love you guys, but you never apologize cracking my tooth last year. Oh, come on man, you are still talking about that. Whoa, who, whoa, I already told you that we're not, it was the oven, bro. Why did you change your name to oven? Ooh! Really, really? Jams? Ask her. You're not gonna come to your dad's for this? Right, right. Those cookies were hard. Oh, wow. That's why we needed a break. Oh, God. God, oh, wow. You understand? Exactly. No, no, no, I think my water just broke. You could still stay. What? But ma'am, you water is right there. No, young man. My water just broke. Oh. Damn. We got a baby. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you want me to do? Call an Uber? No, no, it's too early now, no. Call an Uber. How is she? She did good. And you did great. Oh my God. I'm just so glad that you decided to come. If you're glad? I'm glad. Look, I just took her vitals, okay? They're good. Okay. Just get off the phone with her doctor and guess what? She'll be here first thing in the morning for a house visit. How are you even able to pull that off? She's my daughter. Oh my God. I love you, Dalton. I love you, thank you. I know. You can now go in. Hey, you okay? I am so proud of you, you did amazing. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. This has literally been the best Christmas ever. I heard that my son is here, safe and sound. You're safe, the whole family was here to be a part of it. I'm just filled with joy. You know, I am truly, truly blessed. We're blessed. Yeah, we are. We are blessed. I've been thinking about what you said last night. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't even worry about that, all right? Your feelings are valid, okay? And I don't want you to feel like I'm forcing you to do anything. I don't feel like you're forcing me. Okay. It's accepted, all right? But I want you to know something. I'm not going anywhere, okay? And you can do whatever you want, all right? As long as I'm here and I'm with my family, I don't care, it's the only thing I want. You mean that? Yeah. You're okay with me doing whatever I want? Whatever you want. Okay, then Ask me. Come on. Ask me. I've been in love with you since the first time I met you, and I still feel the same way to this day. I will never leave you again. I love you, Roz. Will you for a second time, for the last time, marry me again? Yes. Yes, I will. I'll tell you when I washed up. I stay good, you understand? That's what I'm saying. Hey, man. That's what it is. Come on man, can we not take so much time in between visits? Why we gotta have a baby to see each other? That's what I'm saying man, it ain't gotta be that. No way it's like that. But no, honestly, man, glad y'all decided to come, we needed this. We got your back, you know that, man. Yeah. Here's my question. What? What's up with that ring? Yeah, we saw it. We saw that ring. What's up with that? Got in this treasure hunt, why he ain't just tell us? We're your brothers, man. No secrets amongst us. What you thought I wasn't gonna put a ring on it? That ain't my baby mama, man, that's my wife. I get it. It not that, but you gotta let us know dawg, come on, man. It just happened, and I wasn't really trying to make a big deal out of it. It's a big deal, that's what I'm saying. So what, y'all wanna have a big deal, you want me to have a wedding? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Y'all boys just want to have another bachelor party. I mean, I'm not saying no. That's it, cool. We can have another wedding, a bachelor party, whatever y'all wanna do. Sound like a plan. Let's do it, man. Find a thick and thoughtful girls. Hey, bro. She got it all. Come on now, bring it in man. I love y'all man. My brothers, man. Good seeing you popping, let's get it. Let's step, let's do this. Tell wifey, hey. She gonna be all right.
