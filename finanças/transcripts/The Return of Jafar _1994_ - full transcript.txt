(MAN SINGING) Follow me to a place where incredible feats Are routine every hour or so Where enchantment runs rampant Yes, wild in the streets Open Sesame Here we go! Arabian nights Like Arabian days They tease and excite Take off and take flight They shock and amaze Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways (HORSE WHINNIES) Pack your shield, pack your sword You won't ever get bored Though get beaten or gored, you might Come on down, stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night Arabian night -This night has been quite rewarding. -(LAUGHS) We have never stolen so much. We have gathered much loot tonight, no thanks to our leader. (GRUNTING) (VASE SMASHING) Well, it only looked expensive. Is this a haul or what, my surly band of desert skunks? (GROWLS) How is it you get the jeweled flower, Abis Mal? Why, this is my bonus for being your beloved leader. This and that and that are my beloved-leader bonus. And what is our reward? (ALL GROWL) Here you go. Good work, boys. Very successful raid. (ALL GASP) -The chest! -It moves! -It cannot be. -What is holding it up? Ah! Ghosts! (EXCLAIMS) -Hello. -You stupid monkey. ALADDIN: Put him down, Abis Mal! (ALL GRUNTING) Who are you? My friends call me Al. You can call me Aladdin. (GROANING) Hurt him! (ALL CLAMORING) ALL: What? -THIEF 1: Where'd he go? -There! THIEF 2: He has our loot! Don't let him get away! -We must stop him! -Stop him! -(HORSE NEIGHING) -Ah! -Why, you... -Hey. (ALL EXCLAIM IN FEAR) A flying carpet? He's got a flying carpet! Nice catch, Carpet. Pardon me. Yeah! Ah! Come back here. (YELLS) That's mine. Next stop, Agrabah. -Get that door! -He's escaping! (SPUTTERS AND COUGHS) Finally. Ooh, ah, oh! This is terrific. I've got sand in places I didn't even know I had. JAFAR: Spare me your prattling, Iago! Are we out yet? "Are we out yet? Are we out yet?" Yes, we're out, no thanks to you! If it weren't for me, you'd be stuck down there forever. JAFAR: Iago! You will now release me so that I may have my revenge. Yeah, yeah, when I'm good and ready. Do as I say, you worthless pipsqueak! You know something? -You're nothing without me. -What? Who comes up with all the good ideas? Me! Who does all the work? Me! If it weren't for me, you'd still be in a cage at the bazaar, squawking, "Polly want a cracker." (SINGING) That's it, I've had it I hate to be dramatic But it's time for me to fly the coop Terrific! Fine! I'm drawing the line before I wind up in a parrot soup I was a fool to let you run the show I'm cutting you loose, pal Look out below! Arrivederci C'est la vie Hope all goes well I'm looking out for me Agrabah, just a juicy golden goose ready for plucking. And I'm the one holding the tweezers. I'll be running this town inside a week! What's your problem, liver lips? You don't think I can do it? (SINGING) Okay, I'm little Been playing second fiddle And I don't get no respect I turn the other cheek But this busted beak is the only thanks that I get I never found a friend that I can trust They promise caviar and leave me eating dust That's some reward for loyalty From here on in, I'm looking out for me I don't need nobody else I'll never fail, I'll cover my own tail I can take care of myself You know, it just don't pay To give a hoot I'm giving all my heart What do I get? The boot I'm through with that I'm flapping free From here on in I'm looking out for me Steal from us again and your scrawny body will be dinner for the jackals! (GROANS) No problem. Ugh! Huh? (SQUEAKING ANGRILY) -No. No! -Abu! No! We're not the ones who need this money. (GASPS) A miracle. Praise be! Don't worry, Abu. I'm not throwing everything. Yes! This is for Jasmine. Whoa! (GROWLS) Uh-oh! Easy, Rajah. You know me. Aladdin? Okay, Rajah. Okay. I'm glad to see you, too. Phew! How do I look? JASMINE: I think you look fine. -Jasmine! -Where were you? I missed you. I had to pick up a few things. This is for you. Oh, Aladdin, it's lovely. Lovely. It must've cost a fortune. Oh, no, it was a steal. Father wants you to join us for dinner tonight. He's going to make a royal announcement. -And he wants me there? -It's about you. -Am I in trouble? -Let's just say this is a dinner you don't want to miss. Jasmine, what's going on? I promised Father I wouldn't spoil his surprise. You've made quite an impression, you know. So, I'm not in trouble? JASMINE: Of course not. You defeated Jafar, saved Agrabah, and rescued a princess. Aladdin, you are a hero. Yeah, I guess so. That's me, ready for anything. (SNARLING) Abu! (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (COUGHING) JASMINE: Um... You may want to change before dinner, though. (CHUCKLES) IAGO: Seems like only yesterday Jafar was running Agrabah and I was his right-hand bird. But then he had to go and mess things up. Now I'm stuck on the outside looking in. I've got to get back into the palace! Back into power. Well, my dear Abu, shall we see what the common folk are doing today? (EXCLAIMING) (ALADDIN CHUCKLES) We have time for a stroll before our audience with the sultan. The street rat is living in the palace now? That does it! All reports are in. Life is now officially unfair. Wait. Wait a second here. This is perfect. That kid is my ticket back into power. I'll just get Aladdin on my side with a little sympathy act. Then I'll be back in the palace again quicker than you can say, "Easy street." -Aladdin... -Huh? Finally got free of Jafar. Iago, what are you doing here? Where are you? Getting dark. Hold me. Ah! Hey, I meant gentle-like! You're not fooling anyone. No, wait, I'm serious. I was under Jafar's power. He mesmerized me with his snake staff, just like the sultan. You traitor, you! -Ah! -Uh! You look familiar. ALL: It's Aladdin. Where? It is? I knew that. Hurt him a lot. Hurt him and his monkey and his bird, too. Oh! (GROANING) Treacherous parrot. Look, I'm not with him. Ah! (LAUGHING) Monkey, help! They're after me. (YELLS) (GROWLING) You won't dance out of this one. That's it, now I'm mad. (GROANS) Mess with this bird, huh? Ah! Huh? And I got more where that came from! My eggs! Ruined! Who will pay for them? -Oh, go away. -Guards! Guards! -What is the trouble here? -It is that thief, Abis Mal. Whoa! After them! Ha! Jerks! Thanks for your help. You saved me. I did? Right! Oh, yeah, of course I saved you. It's my nature. I'm always rescuing things. Cats, babies, guys like you. Always rescuing. Hey, what's going on? Is this any way to treat your rescuer? You owe me, pal. I saved your life. Abu, wait! He's right. I do owe him. I'll see that the sultan gives him a fair hearing. What? The sultan? Ow! Don't worry, I'll talk to him. Soften him up a little. Are you kidding? He hates me. -And what about the Princess? -Hmm? No problem. I just have to make sure that Jasmine doesn't see you until I've gotten her prepared. -Gotten me prepared for what? -Ah! Uh... I mean, for the stain Abu got on the brand-new vest you gave him. I did not. I don't see a stain. Ah, well, no problem, then. Off to dinner. Can't wait for that surprise. Is something wrong? Huh? Wrong? Oh, come on. No, no, no. Everything's just fine. You aren't hiding anything from me, are you? Any more secrets? Secrets? (COUGHS) Of course not. Uh... I almost lost you once that way. -I'll never make that mistake again. -(SQUAWKS) What? Yee-haw! He's big. He's blue. He's back! -Genie! -You came back! Ow! Ooh! Watch the sunburn! Ha! Kidding! Did you miss me? Be honest. Take care of these, my good mammal. Careful, they're heavy. Hang on. I got souvenirs for everybody. Whoo, she dances. You saw the whole world already? (SINGING) It's a small world after all But Agrabah has something that no other place in the world has. You guys! (SINGING) I parachuted down into the Taj Mahal I rollerbladed all along the great Great Wall I even made the famous Leaning Tower fall But who was with me through it all? Nobody! The Moscow Circus hired me to fly trapeze On Mount Olympus ran a race with Hercules It's easy when you're chased by killer bees Who said, "Gesundheit," when I sneezed (SNEEZES) So now I'm home Home again with you You chase the clouds away Whenever I am blue You're always blue. And though the pyramids I highly recommend There is nothing in the world quite like a friend Slept like a babe in Bombay on a bed of nails Moroccans loved my daring Dance of Seven Veils Why, single-handedly I even saved the whales No one was there to hear my tales (WEEPS) In Acapulco, joined a mariachi band I rode the raging rapids down the Rio Grande Flew in an air balloon But when I tried to land Nobody laughed or lent a hand Without you the Amazon is just a trickle Without you the Sahara's not so hot Without you Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet The QE2 is just some yacht Now that I'm home Home again, it's clear All I ever wanted Seems to be right here I've traveled east and west and now I'm back again And there's nothing in the world quite like a friend There's nothing in the world Nothing in the whole wide world There is nothing in the world quite like a friend Nothing in the whole wide world! So, Genie, how does it feel to be free? Seriously? I love it! (CRACKING) Okay, maybe my powers aren't what they used to be. Let's say they're semi-phenomenal, nearly cosmic. But don't sell me short. I may be free, but I still have some magic in me. I can still do this! Hate to lose face in front of you guys. Give me another chance. Who's first? I can do this. -Genie. Genie, we have to go to... -Dinner. We're late! Oh! You probably have a romantic dinner for two planned. You don't need a big blue lug gumming up the works. -But, Genie... -Three's a crowd. You kids go on. Genie, I would be honored if you'd join us for dinner. You would? Come on, everyone, get in here. Home cooking, let's go! Oh, boy! (SQUEAKS) Not you, Abu. You have a job to do, remember? You have to guard Iago. Oh! Giddy up, slowpoke. What's keeping you? Nothing. Well, something, but I'll tell you later. That stinking Aladdin! First chance I get, I'll slice him in half. That stinking Abis Mal. First chance we get, let's slice him in half. Hey! Get over here and wash up! It's bad enough to have to look at you without having to smell you. Come, we do it now. No witnesses. Ow! What is this? So help me, I'll sue whoever runs this well. A lamp? It might be worth a few shekels once it's cleaned up. It will be of little use to you, Abis Mal, except to light your way in the Valley of the Dead. Ah! It is bewitched! (EVIL LAUGHTER ECHOES) (WHINNIES) I am free! Free to exact vengeance upon he who has imprisoned me. (GRUNTING) It is the curse of the lamp. All the power in the universe and I am bound by the rules of the genie. Which means I can't kill that upstart Aladdin. Unless I have someone arrange it for me. Take me to Agrabah at once! (WHIMPERS) (JABBERS AND WHIMPERS) I suppose I am a bit too much for his limited mind. I trust you'll find me a little less overwhelming now? You're a genie? You are astonishingly perceptive. If you're a genie, then don't I get wishes? Yes, three wishes. That is a minor formality. But first, I must go to Agrabah. You will take the lamp there for me. Then, uh, you need me. I'll take you to Agrabah, but first, I want my wishes. (YELPING) Why, you... You shall have your wishes. I shall? I mean, of course I shall. (LAUGHS) I want riches, treasure. Let's see... I know... I wish for the legendary sunken treasure ship of Kordumair. Your wish is my command. Oh! Poor, sweet baby. Aren't we enjoying our wish? No! Perhaps you wish me to return you to the desert? Yes. Very well. That was two wishes. Take your time with the third, or you will wish you had never been born. On the other hand, if you cooperate with me, I will see that you are amply rewarded. -Rewarded? -First, you will help me get revenge on a certain street rat by the name of Aladdin. Aladdin? I want revenge on him, too! He robbed me, turned my men against me, and he fought dirty! My brilliant swordsmanship availed me not. I hate when I do that. Let's not be too hasty, my simple-minded friend. It's not enough that we simply destroy Aladdin. After all, there are things so much worse than death. (LAUGHING EVILLY) Okay, prepare yourselves for a real culinary treat. Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Oh, my! Whoopsie! Most amusing. Amusing? Right. Excuse me while I pull myself together. (LAUGHING) Absolutely delightful. Now to business. Aladdin, you have proven to be a man of strong moral character. That is why I've decided to make you my new royal vizier. Me? Really? Isn't it wonderful? Wow! Royal vizier! Aladdin would like to thank the Academy for this great honor. You want 'em, we got 'em, royal vizier T-shirts. (HORN SOUNDING) All hail Aladdin, the royal vizier! So, what's a royal vizier? Well, he will be my most trusted advisor. Well, that makes sense. He's bound to be better than that Jafar character. Quite so. -And Iago! Talk about a rat with wings. -Uh, Genie? Phew! That bird was mean. Sultan want a cracker? Sultan want a cracker? Remember that? I can still taste them, the traitor! Yes, sir. You don't see this guy hanging out with any evil parrots. (LAUGHS) Uh... It's funny you should mention Iago. Oh, oh, monkey? (HOOTING) Come on, monkey. Little birdie want to talk to monkey. Have nice banana. (HOOTING) Birdie get monkey a pretty banana if monkey open cage. Yum-yum. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on! I've got a wife and three eggs! (SOBS) Imagine them hatching, never knowing their daddy. Come on! Open the cage! Open it, open it, open it! Yeah, that's more like it. Ah! (GROWLS) Close the cage! Close it, close it, close it! (YELLS) Aladdin, your monkey's trying to kill me! I saved your life! It's payback time, Aladdin. (YELLS) Whoa! (YELLS) Aladdin! Rajah, you know better than to tear around the palace like that. Help! Hey! So, Aladdin, why did you bring up that deceitful parrot? Uh, Sultan, I have to tell you something about Iago. (SNEEZES) (GULPS) He's here. -(GASPS) Iago! Guards! -(ALADDIN PROTESTING) -No, wait! You don't understand. -Get that bird! Yes, Your Highness. It would be my pleasure. No, Sultan, no! -Move out of my way, boy. -You don't understand. Just listen. -I have a... -Your Highness! I trust he has a fitting explanation for this scandal. He had better. Your Highness, I think Iago was... Uh... Mesmerized. Yeah, yeah. He was under Jafar's spell. Remember the snake staff? Iago was only... Uh... Look, I just... Iago's not all that bad. At least, I don't think so, anyway. Should have stuck with the snake staff defense. Not all bad? He only served my greatest enemy, that's all! We can't allow that traitorous bird to run free! Then I'll watch him! Uh... Your Highness, I meant, with your permission, I'd like to take full responsibility for Iago. You would? Your priorities seem questionable to me, but so be it. Aladdin, you will watch Iago every moment. And if the bird makes one wrong move, you shall be the one I pluck, boy. Uh, that could've gone worse. Jasmine, I thought I was sunk. Ooh, not good. You were hiding Iago all along, weren't you? I think it just got worse. Well, yes. But... How could you? More secrets, more lies. Aladdin, I thought you had changed. Jasmine, wait! Back in the marketplace, Iago, he... He saved my life. Some grand vizier I'm going to make. Everybody's mad at me. Hey, Jasmine's just a little steamed. She'll cool down. Care for a cup? This isn't cheering you up, is it? Yuck! I don't get it, Genie. I try to do something good and it blows up in my face. (SIGHS) That's the problem with doing the right thing. Sometimes you do it by yourself. That kid saved my life. Nobody's ever looked out for me before. Now it's... It's like I owe him. Nah! Just let your conscience be your guide. Conscience? Never had one. Never. Phew! What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack? A-ha! You do have a heart. An itty-bitty one, but it is there. Can you quit with the hocus-pocus already? Look at him. Would it kill you to do something nice for him? Possibly. I don't do nice. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. I don't do fun, either. We have to get Al and the Princess back together. Look, I definitely don't do mushy stuff. It's not me. I know, but it's going to be tricky. Tricky is good. Tricky I can do. (WEEPING) IAGO: Come on, Princess, don't waste your tears on him. You! You get out of here! Hey! Don't take it out on me! He's the creep. I never should've saved his life. Saved his life? Yeah, he owed me one. That's why he stood up for me. But he didn't have to lie to me. You are so right. (SINGING) Forget about that guy Forget about the way you fell into his eyes Forget about his charms Forget about the way he held you in his arms Walking on air's obnoxious The thrills, the chills will make you nauseous And you'll never get enough Just forget about love She's buying it. Now make with the magic. Forget about romance Forget about the way your heart begins to dance Jasmine. Then you feel the blush When he's spouting out some sentimental mush Love really is revolting It's even worse than when you're molting Enough of this fluff Just forget about love I had almost forgotten the way it felt When he held out his hand for mine My heart all aflutter Oh, how I shudder The first time we kissed It won't be missed Forget about his touch -I can't forget about his touch -In the scheme of things It doesn't matter much -It matters so much -You're better on your own A meal becomes a banquet when you eat alone (HUMMING) -Love's filled with compromises -Love's filled with compromises And don't you hate those big surprises? A cozy rendezvous Oh, please! -Candlelight for two -Oh, jeez! Look, you're calling my bluff -I can't forget about love -Just forget about love Uh, Jasmine. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have kept Iago a secret. -Aladdin, you don't have to... Shh. -Please, I've got to say... (SINGING) I can't forget about my heart I can't forget about my heart And how it felt to fall for you right from the start I'm still falling Whatever we may do -Whatever we may do -You are here for me -And I'll be there for you -I'll be there -To wish, to want, to wander -To wish, to want, to wander To find the sun through rain and thunder A cozy rendezvous Yes, please Candlelight for two IAGO: Oh, jeez! Enough is enough -We can't forget about love -We can't forget about love (THUDS) We did it. We're in. It's about time. It was getting hot. How very like Iago. He's lost no time endearing himself to those in power, which fits in perfectly with my plan. I'm sorry, Jasmine. Shh. (GENIE SIGHS) Love. Don't mind us. Yeah, well, this is kind of a special moment. Right. Got it. Say no more. Enough said. Roger, over and out. Rolling. Today's special moments are tomorrow's memories. Looking great, Jas. More emotion, Al. Tilt your chin a bit. What does he have to do to make it clear to you lunkheads? The show's over! They want to be alone! Break it up! Are you sure about him? Move it, primate! Shoo! Go on! That takes care of the peanut gallery. If you need me, I'll be lazing about in the lap of luxury. I'm sure about this. Oh, yeah. Being one of the good guys has its advantages. Ah. Advisor to Aladdin, the new grand vizier. And when Aladdin becomes sultan, that will make me the grand vizier. Only I'm not going to blow it like that idiot Jafar. I'll never have to stand in his shadow again. Jafar! Buddy? A funny thing happened. You see, this guy took the lamp. You probably thought it was me because it sounded a lot like me. But a lot of people sound like me. Anyway, he took the lamp and... Oh! Calm yourself, Iago. I haven't come for revenge against you. So, that's good to hear. I got it! I could wish for the famed treasure chest of King Malakhan! Oh, I am dreadfully sorry. I thought that was your wish. Are you quite all right? -No, I am not quite... -Wonderful. Good to see all's well. Abis Mal here is my new friend. And I couldn't help noticing that you've made some new friends, too. Like Aladdin. Friend? "Friend" is such a strong word. He's more like an acquaintance. I'm arranging a little surprise for Aladdin, and your job is to lead him to the party. You know, I don't think I'm the guy for this job. You know, you should talk to... Uh... The monkey. Yeah! The monkey's really got Aladdin's ear. No, Iago. You! You know, Aladdin... Al... Here's an idea. I was just thinking... GENIE: Aiming, focus, focus. Focus, focus. Focus, focus. Aiming and shoot. (YELLS) Oh, sorry, little feathered friend. I'll get that out. Friend? Ha! Oh, it's stuck good. Cue-ball-ectomy. Nurse! Abu, Iago here is our friend now. We can trust him. Now let's get that ball out of his beak. What do you say? Well, okay. Brilliant, Nurse Heimlich. Thanks, Bobo. -It's Abu. -Whatever. That's the spirit. We're all one big family now. Yeah. Sure. Family. Oh, brother. Yeah, well, I've got to find Al. Your shot. Pool's a man's game, so being a rug, you'll be at a... Ah, pool's a dumb game, anyway. ALADDIN: I can't explain it, Jasmine. I think we can trust Iago. Well, then I guess I can give him a chance. (DOOR SQUEAKS) -Iago? -Uh... I was just thinking, maybe it's time you patched things up with the sultan. He might enjoy a nice, scenic carpet ride? Hmm, that's a good idea. And I'll bring Genie. He was a big hit with the sultan. No! No! No! I mean, Genie's... He's too flashy, he's too loud. You'd never get a word in. Good point, Iago. You need some quiet time with Father. Let him get to know you. Yeah. And I... -I can take you to the perfect spot. -Great. Come on, let's get Father. Just a minute. Iago, this isn't easy for me to say, but I was wrong about you. (GROANS) -Wait a second! -Yes, Iago? Uh... I'll be along in a minute. Excellent. -Give them a chance, Father. -Oh, I'll try, dearest. After you, Your Highness. Oh! (GIGGLES) -All right, Carpet, let's go. -Whoopie! Have a good time. Hey, clear the way! Make room for the picnic boys. They already left, Genie. -(GASPS) Without us? -Without us? -No problem. I'll catch up in a flash. -Wait! Without me, too. Aladdin needs some time alone with Father to patch things up. You know what this means, monkey boy? More food for us! All right! I'm sorry. Did you want some? I'm not hungry just now. You two go ahead. (SULTAN LAUGHS) Come on, my boy, show me what this thing can really do. (ALL YELL) That's the spot. On top of the waterfall. I'm losing my feathers here! You're lucky you haven't lost more than that. Whoa! (LAUGHS) Oh, what fun. (GROANS) Iago, I have to hand it to you. This is a nice place. It doesn't get any better than this, eh, shaggy? How about a nice drumstick? This could use some secret herbs and spices. Spiders! Things could get ugly. Jafar! Sorry to spoil your picnic, boys. But I can't have any genies mucking about, ruining my plans. Don't worry, Abu. He's a genie, and genies can't kill anyone. But you'd be surprised what you can live through. (LAUGHING) You always were good for a laugh. Oh, yeah? (PANTING) (LAUGHS) Who's laughing now? (LAUGHING THUNDEROUSLY) Why, I believe it's me. (SINGING) I must admit your parlor tricks are amusing I bet you've got a bunny under your hat Now here's your chance to get the best of me Hope your hand is hot Come on, clown Let's see what you've got You can try to slam me with your hardest stuff But your double whammy isn't up to snuff I'll set the record straight You're simply out-of-date You're only second-rate You believe your cat's a meany but your tiger's tame You've got a lot to learn about the genie game So, for your education, I reiterate You're only second-rate Men cower at the power in my pinky My thumb is number one on every list But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible Put me to the test I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise Slap me in a trap Cut me down to size I'll make a great escape It's just a piece of cake You're only second-rate You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough And your mumbo jumbo doesn't measure up Let me pontificate Upon your sorry state You're only second-rate Zabacabadabra Granny's gonna grab ya Alakazomnibus This thing's bigger than the both of us So spare me your tremendous scare You look horrendous in your underwear And I can hardly wait to discombobulate I'll send you back and packing in a shipping crate You'll make a better living with a spinning plate You're only second-rate Hello? Hello? That was invigorating. Come, Abis Mal, we have other lives to ruin. Sultan, look, I'm sorry for not telling you about Iago. (HUFFS) I guess I saw some good in him. Just like you saw some good in a street rat. The good I saw in a... Well, yes, I suppose. Well said, my boy. Oh, you'll be a fine vizier. -This was a great idea, Iago. Thanks. -Oh, don't thank me. Really. (NEIGHING) (GASPS) ALADDIN: Sultan! Abis Mal! Aladdin! Stop! (COUGHING) You traitor! "Traitor" is such a strong word. SULTAN: Aladdin! Help! I'll settle with you later. Come on, Carpet. Look, they're trapped on the cliff. When they stop, we'll... What? Abis Mal knows magic? Whoa! What? Get them! Get the sultan! Hang on, Sultan. This is where we lose them. (SULTAN YELLS) Sultan! We have to go back, Carpet. (SPUTTERING) (ABIS MAL LAUGHING) Yes! Wha? What are you doing? Are you nuts? You saved him! He was this close to being a greasy little smear on the rocks. Look, you little... I mean, my dear Abis Mal. If you remember the plan, it is not yet time for the boy to meet his end. Um... I knew that. Soon our revenge will be complete, and you shall have your third wish. Oh, boy, the little wishy. And you, Iago, you have done well. Please, don't mention it. (COUGHS) Sultan! Iago. SULTAN: Jafar, you fiend! I should've known that this was your treachery. But I couldn't have done it without Iago. Ugh! I played a minor role, really. Jafar! This rug won't cooperate! When Aladdin returns... I think we have ample time to prepare for his arrival. Hey, that was a nice hat. I could've worn that hat. We need this for our plan. Couldn't we use another hat for the plan? Oh, no. The sultan's turban and this dagger are exactly what we need to seal Aladdin's doom. (BREATHING HEAVILY) -Razoul, the sultan's been... -Seize him! You are under arrest for the murder of the sultan. What? No! And then you went over the waterfall, eh? Pah! How did you survive? I don't know. How very convenient. It's the truth! Why won't you believe me? JASMINE: Because we know you're lying. I found this in your room. My father's turban, slashed. -You can't think... -I thought you loved me, but now I see that all you wanted to do was rule Agrabah. -I never wanted... -He shall die at dawn for the murder of my father. Jasmine, please! You're in my hands now, street rat! (LAUGHING) Oh, you should've seen the look on Aladdin's face when Princess Jasmine sentenced him to death. -No! -Oh, yes! And then I get my wish. Yes, and then you get your wish. Iago! I swear one day you will pay for this. I really think you're making too big a deal out of this. Hmm, such spirit. Perhaps after a few days in chains, you'll be more kindly disposed toward me. Especially if you want your father to remain healthy. Ah, Iago! You betrayed me and allied yourself with my enemies. And you turned on them as soon as it was in your best interests. That's what I love about you. You're so perfectly predictable. A villain through and through. Thank you, thank you. Phew! (COCK CROWS) (INHALES) Dawn! I'll tell your boyfriend goodbye for you, Princess. Oh... When I get hold of you, Jafar... (CHATTERING) I'm so worried. Phew! How could you double-cross Aladdin after all he's done for you? (SQUEALING) Hey! Do I insult your mother? What are you doing now? Oh, what does it look like I'm doing? I'm trying to free the chump genie so he can save your chump boyfriend. (METAL CLANGING) Oh... Oh... You have to lift it higher. (GASPING FOR BREATH) Sure, no problem. -Wait. -Jasmine! I knew you wouldn't go through with this. I just wanted to say goodbye, street rat! Jafar! It's... (MUFFLED) (GRUNTING) -Thanks for saving me. -Oh, come on, Al, you know I had to. That no-head look is just not you. For my next trick, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! Ho-ho! And everybody's safe and sound. Aladdin! Aladdin! Good to see you, too, Abu. There's somebody else who wants to talk to you. Hello. You set me up! How could you show your face? You're nothing but a... Aladdin, Iago rescued us. He didn't have to, but he did. Rescued? Him? Please note, "Did not have to, but did." Now we should be fleeing for our lives, if you don't mind. No, we have to stop Jafar. But how? He's so powerful. His lamp. You destroy Jafar's lamp, you destroy Jafar. Then that's what we'll do. Reality check. Jafar is large and in charge! My, yes. There's no telling what Jafar will do to Agrabah. We have a responsibility. Maybe you do, but I don't. I'm only responsible for me, myself and nobody. I understand, Iago. You've done enough. And thanks. Hey! I did my good deed. I don't owe you a thing. You hear me? Not a thing. (LAUGHING EVILLY) Now that my revenge is complete, there is one little matter left to resolve. Yes, the wish! Indeed. You will now wish me free of this wretched lamp! No! My wish! You got what you wanted. Now it's my turn. But you don't need to waste your third wish. You want the sunken treasure of Kordumair? It's yours. (LAUGHS) ABIS MAL: Yes, yes, yes! Yes, I love it! I love it! Silver! Rocks! Rocks of all colors and sizes. So this means I could have more stuff? Ooh! I always wanted one of those. Nice. More. More! Oh, dear. Now, if that's obscenely excessive enough, perhaps you'd care to grant my freedom. What? Oh, yeah. Right. I wish you were free. Sure thing. Yeah. I wish for Jafar to be... Wait. How do I know that these things won't disappear once I set you free? The more pressing question is, how will you stay alive if you don't? But you said genies can't kill. You said that. You'd be surprised what you can live through. What? Huh? -Hey! -I'll take that. My lamp. Give me that... The street rat, still alive? No! Ah! (SCREAMING) Thanks, Genie. Where's the lamp? (LAUGHING EVILLY) The lamp! Not so fast. Give it up, Jafar. We're obviously too much for you to handle. You! You're a fool to challenge me. I am all-powerful. Some all-powerful. You can't even get rid of a lowly street rat. A problem I mean to rectify right now. JASMINE: Aladdin! (YELLS) -What? -Gotcha. Go, Al! Genie! Faster, Carpet. Carpet, no! Aladdin! -Whoa! -(LAUGHING) Genie, wake up. (ALADDIN YELLS) (LAUGHING EVILLY) Give it up, boy! You shall never have my lamp. And there is no one to save you this time. Hey, Jafar! Shut up! Iago? Traitor! No! (JAFAR LAUGHS) Good help is so hard to find these days. Isn't it, Aladdin? (GASPS) My lamp! (YELLS) Iago! (ROARS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) All right! Iago. No. But I thought a genie couldn't kill anyone. (COUGHS) You'd be surprised what you can live through. All right! Oh, Iago! He's alive! IAGO: And so the bird lived happily ever after, wallowing in luxury as Aladdin's palace pal. Now, my dear boy. Or should I say my new vizier? Oh, say it! Sultan, I'm very honored, but... But? What "but"? "But" is such a strong word. Why, I ought to... I can't be your vizier. What? Sultan, the boy's talking crazy talk. Don't listen! -What more do you want? -The world. Look, personally, I'm with you, kid, but let's take it one step at a time. ALADDIN: I mean... I wanna see the world. I can't just stay in the palace. There's too much to do, too much to see. Hey, what about your girlfriend? Do you think that this lovely princess is just gonna wait around here? I most certainly will not. There, you see? I'm going to see the world, too. Okay, that's it. The madness is spreading. (SQUAWKS) Crazy talk. Why do I keep getting hooked up with these warped people? Shouldn't somebody ask what the brave parrot wants to do? Does this mean I don't get my third wish?
