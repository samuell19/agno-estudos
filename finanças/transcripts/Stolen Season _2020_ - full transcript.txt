Don't touch me. No, I am going in there. Get the fuck out of the way. I'm going in there. Dad, do you understand that she is pregnant? You can't just leave her locked in the room. I don't give a fuck what you think. Open the fucking door. God, you are such a fucking, you are a fucking asshole, move! Ariane, fuck. What did you do? Ariane, what the fuck have you done? How many pills have you taken? Talk to me, Ariane. Oh shit. Okay, your water broke. We need to go to the hospital now. We need to go now. Oh God, fuck, this kid's coming. The kid is coming now. Fuck, okay, I've got to drive you. I'm gonna fucking drive you to the hospital, let's go. Fuck. Hi. I would like to put in a request to get in touch with an adoptive family. I am a birth mother. The waiver, yeah, I signed it a couple years ago. Yeah, I'll hold. - Hi. - Hi. I'll take that. Thank you. I missed you. You look great. You got anything to drink? Yeah. So. How has your brother been? I haven't seen him in a while. Can we not talk about him? Slow down, slow down. Hey, calm down. Look at me, look at me. I realize I've never told you your story. I'll never forget the day I surrendered you. Life was very complicated back then. You don't always have to leave. I know. I was so scared. And this lawyer came to me, and she told me that you could be okay. That you could have a really good life. That's all I cared about. I was 17. And for a few brief moments, you were mine. Thank you for taking the time to see me. Of course. It's about my son Logan. For the past month, it's been really hard to get a read on what's going on with him. He's skipping school, smoking pot. Started calling me Kristen. I just, I don't see him. And when I do, he won't talk. How old is Logan? He just turned 17, on the 15th. And with my work schedule, it's just been really hard to find the time to deal with all of this. What about something that may have triggered this new behavior? Any kind of trauma? No, not exactly. Except... It's okay. Take your time. I was never able to conceive, so we adopted Logan. We brought him home from Legacy Emmanuel Hospital. Okay. - And so you've told him. - Yeah. Just last month. And has he had any contact with his birth mother at this point? No, I don't think he's ready for that. If I can ask, what made you wait until now to tell him? I felt guilty. He deserves to know the truth. Well, first of all, I think it's important to point out what a brave thing you've done by telling him. I'm sure that was very scary for you. Also, parenting is, it's impossible. And stressful. And you've taken a huge step in helping your son by even coming here today. So I just really want to acknowledge that. Thank you. And you know, if you'd like, I'd be happy to see him one on one. You know, it's possible that he'll open up if he feels like he's being given the space to do so. That would be great. Okay. Sure. So what did your sister say? Thing is, it's his birthday this week. Which usually distracts her. So we'll see. Look, I get it. I can't imagine what that's like. But this isn't healthy, she needs to move on. Yeah, no shit. Try telling her that. Hey look. Whatever happens, we'll make it work. I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. She needs to respect everything you've done for her. She wouldn't be who she is if it weren't for you. Ariane, got a minute? Yeah, is everything alright? Oh yeah, yeah, how'd it go? Oh it was fine. So listen, a bunch of us are gonna go to dinner. I don't know if you have any plans, but you're certainly welcome to join us. Oh, thank you. But, I'm kind of exhausted, actually. I think I'm just gonna go home. Yeah I had to add something... Fuck, hold on one second. What the fuck? Hey. What are you doing here? Hi. Just stopped by after work. Can I... Can I hang out here for a bit? Yeah, of course. You doing okay? It's been, I had to fire somebody yesterday, so... Oh shit. Business, it's been rough. I need a little bit of help. Yeah, how much. Five grand? It's a big ask, I get that. You're gonna go there today, huh? I'm just in a tough spot, okay? All I'm saying is we got each other's backs, right? We always have. Yeah buddy. Can I think about it? Yeah, no totally, think about it. - Okay, thank you. - Think about it for sure. Yo yo yo! What's going on? Stupid. How's your whole life been? Fuck. Can you just do this for me? Look, I know it's not easy, but I really think it'll help. You really can't do this, can you? Logan, please, just make an effort. That's all I'm asking. An effort? Okay, I'll make an effort. You want to talk, let's talk. Alright, no stranger in a room bullshit. Just you and me, right now. Let's be honest. You want to try that? You think you can do that? Come on, go ahead. Just be open, okay? Good talk. You know, I'm really glad you could fit this into your schedule. You decorate this place yourself? I did. "Resurrecting Sex." Sounds like you have a blast in here, huh? Can I go out on a limb and take a little guess here? First therapy session. Can you tell? Yeah I can tell. It's cool, though. Welcome, welcome to therapy. I'm glad you came today. You obviously don't want to be here, but I'm glad you came. Is this what they tell you in the books? So I met your mom. She seems pretty cool. So Kristen came crying? I think she just wants what's best for you. Kristen's caught up in her own shit. I'm caught up in mine. It's as simple as that. Is this all confidential? Yes. And what did she say about me? Ah, see here's the thing. It's confidential for her, too. I know, it's annoying, but it's fair. In that case, you have my permission to tell her that she's a bitch. Okay. So. We have an hour. That's my only job, is to listen. What you got? I got nothing to say, really. Great. Oh, that's so much better. Must meet a lot of fucked up people here. Yeah. I guess you could say that. Not married? You know, I think I'm supposed to be the one asking the questions here, actually. I just remembered. What about you? I don't see a ring on your finger. I'm 17, thank you. Oh, okay. No come on, you got like a... You got a person? You got a significant other? There's a girl. I don't know about a girlfriend, per se. What's this girl's name? Megan. Megan. Nice. Have you told her how you feel yet? No. Why not? 'Cause it's still new. I don't want to fuck things up. I'm afraid she's not gonna feel the same way. So, one way to go here. Next time you're with Megan, and you feel like telling her, tell her. But I don't know how she feels. No no, see that's not the point, though. What matters is how you feel. Your mom told me that she recently told you about your adoption. How are you feeling about her? Your birth mother. I don't care one way or another. What's done is done. You don't care at all? Are we done? 'Cause I feel like we're done. We still have plenty of time. Look, I came here and did my part. You have my permission to tell Kristen that. Okay, we can end early, but I just, one more question before you go, okay? Have you considered making contact? Jesus Christ. It's not like it would change anything. We can talk about it more next time. I'd really love to see you again, Logan. Fuck. I like it. They're pretty good. Yeah, they're pretty good. Do you want to hang out later, or something? What? It means yeah sure in French. Oh. Someone didn't take French class. Jesus, dude. You scared the shit out of me. No, help yourself. I tried ringing the doorbell, but you weren't answering. What's up? Who's that for? Oh, it's just a friend. Ariane, should I be worried about you? No, by the way, your check is on top of the microwave. No seriously, dude, I have to go to bed. I'm exhausted. It took me years to get you back. I don't know what the fuck that is. I'm fine, okay? Please just take what you came for, and please go. You're shutting me out. You know, you did this last time. Remember? You shut me out and I had to fucking force my way in. And Ariane, you know, I barely got to you in time. So maybe this time around, Ariane, please. Maybe just fucking let me in. Ariane, just tell me what the fuck's going on here. Just tell me what the fuck's going on. It's nothing, okay? It's just this patient. This high school kid. He just found out he was adopted. I can relate. So maybe that's what you're feeling with me right now? Look, Ariane. I am always gonna be here for you. Always, that is not gonna change. But I need you to be careful that this thing, that it doesn't fuck you up. I'm not going there right now with you. Okay, Ariane. Not every kid that you cross paths with is yours. You think I don't know that? It's been 17 years, Ariane. You need to start taking steps to move on. Please. Leave that kid the fuck alone. Hey. You look pretty good on that thing. Thanks. Liam said you'd probably be here. I was just gonna do some studying for midterms, and thought that maybe you'd want to come join? Yeah. I like that. Okay. So, are you gonna give me a ride on this thing, or what? Hop to the back? Okay. You know, you were cute for a second there, and then you just messed that up. - I lost it? - Yeah. I have to try a little bit harder, then. Oh, oh. Your hands are cold. This creep is following me! What, you act like you don't want to get in the water. For somebody who has jeans on, I don't know if I... Jeans? That's what I got. You want me to take 'em off? You know what you're doing. I love you. Wait, what? I love you. What? What? No, no. Hold on. I think... I think we made a mistake. What do you mean a mistake? What we have, it's not serious. Right? Don't bullshit me. Logan. Seriously? Hey. You going out? No, I just got, I was just about to hop in the shower. Huh. I ran into Kyle. And? And, fuck, Ariane, maybe give this guy a chance. He says you're giving him the cold shoulder. That's the reason why you drove all the way out here, to tell me that? - Well. - Hey, I'll tell you what. If I want to talk to either of you guys, you'll be the first to know, okay? Alright, okay, just listen for a second, alright? Did you think about the thing that we talked about the other night? Yeah. I actually referred him to another therapist. So, happy? Yeah, wow, fuck, good. Yeah, no, that's good. Awesome, wow, I'm proud of you, really. In other news, I think I may have found someone. So what, you want me to meet her? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. When? Next week. Next week, yeah, I'll make it work. Cool. Hello? Halle-fucking-lujah. Your phone works. That's awesome. That's such good news. Listen, next time, call first. I see what you did there. - That's very funny. - Yeah, night! - Very funny, actually I... - Bye. Cool, I'll just, I'll get going. Shit. Where have you been all night? - Out. - Out, out where? Do you have any idea what time it is? The school called again. This time to say that they are seriously reconsidering your future there. Do you have any idea what you're doing? You keep this shit up and you are gonna get expelled. What, you think I don't know that? Oh don't act like you are better than this. Fuck off. What did you just say to me? I said leave me the fuck alone! Wow. Congratulations. You just got yourself grounded. Oh, and your bike. Keys. Now! Hello? Hi, could I speak to Ariane Longwood? Yeah, yes, this is she. Hi Ariane. This is Diane from Family Care Adoptive Services. I'm just calling to inform you that unfortunately your request to contact the adoptive family has been denied. - Hi. - Hi. Funny seeing you here. I was just about to call you. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you dropping off your kids? Oh, it was my nephew, actually. I'm helping out my brother today. What's up? I just, I just want to ask you about Logan. How you think he's doing. Right, yeah, you know. Well, there's only so much that I can tell you. - But he is doing great. - Really? Honestly, yeah. He's really mature. He started opening up. Wow, okay, that's... I gotta say, that's really surprising to hear. Yeah, you know, I also think he's ready to meet his birth mother. Oh. Really? Even in our brief time together, you know, I think that it would be a remarkable gesture on your part. And you know, I think even though Logan doesn't want to admit it, I think that it's a huge reason that he's been acting out. So, you know. Go ahead and think about that. Be patient. And we'll figure it out. Alright, didn't mean to keep you. - Hey, you're good. - Thank you. Take care. I'm so excited, are you going? So why are you not going? You gotta take somebody. You want to go? I mean, you're hot. Yo, are you good? Hello? Hello? Hey, what the hell are you doing here? I know I'm covered in dirt, - but I need a hug. - Oh no, come on. - You smell like garbage. - I know. Did you get off of work today? Yeah, I was just running some errands. What are you doing out there? Oh just burning some old rotted out wood. I mean, this whole fucking place, - this whole apartment is... - Uh huh, yeah. You know what, that is the one thing that the old man did correctly. Pass this piece of shit on to you, my friend. Thank God. I've maintained its shittiness for 10 years. If not, more shitty. Well done. - Speaking of which. - Huh? I got a call from somebody wanting to buy this shit hole. Take it, this is a no-brainer. - I already told 'em no. - Well you know what? Fucking fine. Just give me a lighter. I'll burn this fucker down right now. - Ariane, calm down. - What? I really want to raise a family here one day. I really do. Are you fucking with me again? Maybe I just want to fix what was broken and just make it better. You're serious. Yeah. I mean, that's fucking great. Seriously, that's... I'm happy for you. Thanks, we'll see how it goes. Be careful there. I haven't thought about this in a long time. Remember when dad would be in one of his moods? I'd always like, squirrel myself away under there. He'd always find me. Every time, he just knew. You know. I really miss him sometimes. I know. I know. I know. Bring it out! Falcons on three! One two three. Falcons, Falcons, Falcons. Hey. Who's winning? It's practice, dude. Oh. I heard you and Megan had a thing going on. What's up with that? Nothing to say. Didn't work out. My first time, I was like a monkey trying to fuck a football. Is that what she's telling people? That it was my first time? I don't know. Who cares if it was, man? Hey, No Vacancy is having an event tonight. Cool. You might meet someone even cuter than Megan. Dude, I'm just trying to get you out of your fucking rut. Dude, you know I saw you today talking to her. You guys looked like you were practically gonna fuck in the hallway. So what? There is nothing going on with me and Megan. Relax. Anyways. My mom made me start seeing someone. You mean like a therapist? Yeah. She's actually not that bad. Is she hot? Always about being hot with you, huh? So she's hot. So she's hot. That's all you had to say. Really? To new beginnings. This shit. Can I see your ID? - Cheers, love you. - Cheers. Fuck. Fuck, fuck Fuck. I feel like I've tried everything, and I cannot seem to get through to him. And he won't even talk to me. I mean, what now? Are you even listening? Yes, mm-hmm. So what now? What now? What the hell am I supposed to do now? Isn't that what I pay you for? To tell me, to fucking guide me. But your hour's up. We're done here, you can go. What is wrong with you? Yeah, yeah what's up? Hey. Sorry I missed your calls last night. I only just saw 'em now. You okay? Oh, yeah. Someone just broke into my car, and smashed a window. Fuck. Did they get anything? Oh, just some cash. But it's fine, I'm fine. It's actually in the shop right now getting fixed. But look, I really gotta go. Hey hey, wait, wait a second. I'm taking Stacey out tonight to dinner, and it would really mean a lot to me if you could be there. Yeah, yeah just text me. So. How are you? I'm good. Still don't want to be here, huh? I'm here, aren't I? I'm really glad that you are. So, do you have anything in particular you'd like to discuss today? Just the fact that I'm a little mad at you is all. Mad at me. After the first time I saw you, Megan and I started hanging out. It was like everything that I wanted it to be. What happened? And one day we were hooking up, and I took your wonderful advice, and I told her that I loved her. And she stopped. Made me feel like a fucking idiot. Told me she didn't want the same thing. I'm genuinely really sorry that that happened. Can I give you another angle on this, though? If that was her reaction, is this somebody you really want to be with? I mean, Logan, I honestly think you should be proud of yourself. Why? Okay, it was fucking humiliating. Sure. Of course it was. But... What you did, it took a lot of courage, man. Okay. What you did is one of the most raw and vulnerable things that anybody can do. And sure, you know, somebody else may have given you the advice to wait 'til the right time, but when the hell is that? And the people that do that, they're not waiting around for the right time because they're smarter than you. They're doing it because it's easy and it's safe. But at least you know now. You didn't wait a year, wondering. Honestly, man, I don't know what's wrong with this girl. Like, if I was your age, I would totally date you, okay? Come on, you're amazing. Thanks. And by the way, did I see you last night? Where? No Vacancy. What's that? The club. No, no, nightclub's not really, it's not really my thing. Yeah I was actually out of town last night. I was visiting some friends. Cool. It's actually pretty nice out. You want to see something kind of rad? Yes, Ariane, I do. Come on, let's go. Have you... Have you thought about contacting your birth mother? If it happens, it happens. Honestly, I just, I don't feel like hunting her down. If you did, what would you say to her? I would not know where to start. Hey. It's got my cell on the back. You can call me anytime you want, okay? Day or night. Careful what you wish for. - That's all I'm saying. - Oh, oh! Alright, sleep's gone. My life is gone. - This drama over here. - I won't abuse it. I won't abuse it. - Cool. - Thanks, by the way. - Of course. - Thanks. Of course. Whoa. Wow. Wow, Ariane. Fucking wow. These guys, they work fast, don't they? I mean, Jesus, that's incredible. I'm sorry, were you just waiting for me? What the fuck is the matter with you? You tell me, without lying this time. I didn't want you to worry about me. Oh you didn't want me to fucking worry about you? What, do you think I'm a fucking idiot? You're being ridiculous. Get the fuck out of my car. - Ow. - You're sick, Ariane. People like you, they don't just get better and go back to being normal. You're fucking lying to me. You are lying to the only person that gives a shit whether you live or die. I'm literally the only one that gives a fuck, Ariane. You are an addict! You will always be a fucking addict that almost killed her own fucking kid. Oh yeah, yeah okay. You think that you're all fucking better now and shit, right? Bullshit! Because deep down, you and I both know, that you are still fucked in the head. Hey, this is Ariane Longwood. Leave a message and I'll get right back to you. Hey, Ari, it's Nathan. I am so sorry. I didn't mean to lose my temper on you like that. I just fucking worry about you sometimes. Let's move past it, okay? Dinner is tonight. I really need you to be there, please. Thank you. One day, I'll show you what I mean. He is such a dork. God, it's so crazy to me that you guys still keep in touch. - You're such opposites. - I know. We just grew apart in so many different ways, and just live such different lives now. He's my friend, I guess. Real talk, though. Oh. Oh, okay. Just for a minute. If there's anything I'm doing that makes you want to leave, - or makes you uncomfortable... - Oh God, no no no. You're fine. You're amazing, actually. It's me. Look, I've just never been good at letting people get close to me. I just didn't want to hurt you. So this whole thing is about protecting me. Well, I never said it was logical. Is she actually coming? I'm starving. We've been sitting here for like 20 minutes. I'll be right back. You want to ask me something, go ahead. Anything? Shoot. You ever thought about having kids? Are you gonna get that? No it's fine. I'm sorry. Just give me a second. Yeah. - What? - Where the fuck are you? We've been waiting for 45 minutes. Waiting for, what do you... Dinner. Seriously? After the shit you pulled this afternoon? Oh my God, I told you that I was sorry. Okay, what more do you fucking want from me? You know what, just fuck it, Ariane. Do you know why dad couldn't stomach you as his daughter? Okay, because you are a compulsive liar and a selfish brat that only pretends to give a fuck when you're trying to get your fix. And as soon as you do, you fucking disappear, only to be found again washed up, strung out, with your tail between your fucking legs. It's really no wonder why dad forced you to give away your kid. Can I have two tequilas, please? Jesus Christ. I think you need to slow down. I think you need to step it up. Can I have two more? Let's go to your room. Ariane, stop. We said we wouldn't do this. I don't want a lecture, I want to fuck you. Stop. You know what, don't do this. Think about this. Look at me, hey. Hey you know this isn't actually going anywhere. This doesn't mean anything. You get that, right? Ariane, just calm down, alright? I hate when people use my fucking name. It's so condescending. Don't touch me. You know what? I'm just gonna call you a cab. Fuck off. I mean like, when are these pickles gonna get here? I want them fried, though. I know. You want me to ask them to fry 'em? You can try. You wanted me. Here I am. You're drunk. So I guess my brother's been feeding you a bunch of bullshit about how we make an amazing team, right? - Actually... - Babe. Just don't. Babe. Oh my god, so tell me everything. Like how is he as a boyfriend? Does he give you a massage? Does he make you dinner? Like, tell me you cum first, please. Like please. It's very important. - This is so embarrassing. - Look. Oh come on. You know how he got to be such a prince, right? Like, our dad, praise that motherfucker, right? Oh man, did he tell you what a hard working man he was? How he was always there for us. Because if he told you that, he's a lying piece of shit. Our dad was a manipulative, abusive cunt, who was only ever good at making people feel fucking worthless. Now, see, no he spared your boyfriend, but according to our last phone call, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. His moral compass seemed to be pretty intact the night you were high as fuck and in labor. Oh shit. Oh I like her. See, Stace, here's the thing, though, about all that. I'm a grown ass woman now. I moved on. This one, still circling the drain. See, he still needs me to need him, but I don't. You think that makes us about square, Nate? I can't do this. You've reached Logan. Leave me your number and I'll call you back. Hey sweetie, it's mom. I just want to know that you're okay. Give me a call. Just let me know that you're alright. Just call me back, okay? I need to talk to you. Sure. You alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Somebody called, concerned about you. Who? The who doesn't really matter now, does it? You know how this works. I've got to take this seriously. So why don't you go home and clear your head? That way, you can come back tomorrow and be more on point, okay? Are you serious? Are you fucking serious? Ariane, just calm down, okay? What's your problem, huh? Fucking my life isn't enough for you, now you're gonna fuck with my fucking job? Stay out of my shit. Get a life, dude. Logan! Excuse me. You looked amazing out there. That's intense man, that's crazy. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm very impressed. I didn't know you could do all that crazy stuff. What are you doing here? - Huh? - What are you doing here? Oh yeah, I know, I know. I have this friend with a really fancy car and a really desperate mid-life crisis. I get it. But I've never seen motocross before. It's really dangerous. Yeah, I don't know. It gets me out of my mind, you know? I just don't want to be at home right now. I do know that. Do you want to get out of here? Go hang out. You want to hang out with me? Yes, you and me, hang out. Just blow off some steam. Yeah, sure. - For real? - For real. - Alright. - What do you got in mind? Kicking your butt. Let's go. Come on. A little bit? No never in a million years did I think that we were gonna be hanging out. Yeah it's cool, right? Hey, I gotta take this phone call. Just hang out for a second. - Do your thing. - I'll be right there. Hello? Hi, hi. I'm really sorry to bother you. I just... I think maybe Logan ran away, and I just, he's not answering his phone. Oh okay, just take a deep breath. Have you tried calling his friends, or... Yeah, I have called everyone I can think of, and I just wondered if there was anything that he said to you, and anything at all. Nothing that I can think of. I'm sure he'll turn up, though. He probably just needed a little space. Now, are you sure he didn't say anything, because I really need to find him. You know, I have no reason to believe that he's in any danger. Okay? You probably just need to be a little patient. Look, I have to go. If I think of anything, I will call you immediately. Okay, I'm sorry, I have a client. Are you kidding me? You ready to get schooled? Let's do this. I think you should be a little afraid. Oh really? I don't know. I just got an inkling. Okay, alright, I see how this works. I'm gonna need all the luck I can get on this one. That's what's up, that's what's up. See, you got this. Hello? Logan, Logan, Logan. Oh I'm not feeling that. I am not feeling that at all. You ready? That does not look like inner space. That looks like an internment space. Are you ready for this? Yeah. You actually got me a strike. Oh I did. - There it is, there it is. - You got it you got it you got it you got it. Yes! - Incredibly impressed. - Thank you. Excuse me, are you recording? What? You've been up here half an hour, and my kid's down there. Stop fucking recording my kid. - It's creepy. - Oh shit. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's weird. - Yeah sorry. Hey. I can't believe it, you're 15 years old. Oh my gosh. You're becoming a man. Yeah, so this right here is my little Buddha zen zone thing. I just got this cool house. I made sure there was an extra bedroom. Just in case. Happy birthday. Yes. Okay, okay. Get that bottom row. - Oh there it is. - How's my time? How's my time, how's my time? This is horribly embarrassing. My dad once warned me that if I brought a child into this world, that my life would be ruined just like I ruined his. That's cute, right? He wanted me to... He was wrong. I was never gonna let him tell me what to do with you. Maybe I don't deserve it. Having him close to me. Every year I reach out, every year your records remain sealed. Not knowing where you are. What you may imagine about me. Why I did what I did. Not knowing how to reach you. Love that. Maybe my dad was right. I really screwed up. It's better this way. I don't deserve you. Man, that was the most fun I've had in years. Yeah, no I needed that. Can I tell you a story? Go for it. About your age, I took my brother's truck out, just to drive around, clear my head, and this dog just ran right out in front of me. And I backed up to see better, if there was anything that I could... But I didn't know what to do. And I panicked and I just drove off. And left it there on the side of the road. I never told anybody that before. I'm sorry. I don't really remember what I was... I guess, I guess what I'm trying to say is that everyone has those points in their life where they feel like it's too much to handle. And I guess I just wanted you to know everything is temporary. Okay? Did you ever want to have kids? I did. I think you'd be a cool mom. I have something for you. Know what? Just wait here, I'll be right back. I don't know what you want, but I can't do this with you right now. Ariane. You're sick. That's it. I'm changing the code. Ariane, you need help. Do you have any idea how insane this makes you look? You don't know what you're talking about, Nathan. Can I please just get back to my car and go on with my day? - Look, I got shit to do. - Wait, wait. You brought him here? - Let me out! - Are you fucking crazy? - Let me out! - Are you fucking crazy? - Let me out of here. - You're not going - fucking anywhere, Ariane. - Let go of me! Hey! You're gonna hate me now, but one day, Ariane, maybe you're gonna fucking understand because that kid's mother deserves to know what the fuck's going on. - What are you gonna... - Hey! Nathan, don't! Hey, get in my truck, I'm taking you home. Who the hell are you? Now. Don't you dare fucking talk to him. Hey, go ahead and get in my car. Come on, let's go, let's go. Hey. I'm really sorry you had to see that back there. It's totally cool. I've actually seen worse. I had an amazing time today, though. Yeah. Today was amazing. Can I get a hug? Yeah. This is not how I expected tonight to end. Me neither. Wait. No. Shit. I'm so sorry. Logan, Logan! Oh shit. - Logan. - Are you alright? - Logan, sweetie, please. - Go inside, Logan. You, you stay right the fuck there. I need to talk to him. You were with him this whole time, weren't you? Look I just, don't touch me! I am not leaving until I talk to my son. What? He's my son, and I am not leaving until I talk to him. You are not his mother. I spoke with her. You're lying. After you told me to, I got in touch with her. What? And you listen to me. He is not yours. I don't know what is going on inside your head, but he is not yours. Now you have five seconds to leave before I call the cops. You are done. You contact him, speak to him, even think about him again, and I will come after you. Uh uh, you can't be here. - Why? - What do you mean why? - Why, yeah. - Because he's a minor. Because she could press charges. Because I am now obligated to report you to the board. - You have one hour. - Please, come on. I'll do whatever I have to do, please. I need this. I got a client there who's threatening to sue us. Fuck. What am I gonna tell her? James, I thought he was my son. I thought he was my baby boy. - You thought? - Yes. You threw it all away because you thought. Is that what I'm supposed to tell the board when I go before them? Give her another chance. She's a good therapist. She knows boundaries. Is that what you want me to say? I don't know. I don't know. I trusted you, we trusted you. I know. I know, James, I'm sorry. ♪ We still can't hear you ♪ ♪ We are number one ♪ - That was really fun. - Yeah. That was actually really fun. Really? Out of all the girls, you had to go for her? Logan, what the hell? - Stop! - What? With him, it's different? Get the hell out of here! Fuck you! You've reached Logan, leave me your number, and I'll call you back. You've reached Logan. Leave me your number, and I'll call you back. Shit. Come on, Ariane, pick up the fucking phone. Hello? I need to ask you something. Am I really that much of a burden? You have no idea how special you are. From the right angle, Saint John's Cathedral looks like an endless vortex ready to suck you in. Hurting you was the last thing I wanted to do. He was right. I fucked you up. You didn't. Ariane. Ariane! Hi, I need an ambulance at Saint John's Bridge. I don't know, I just got here. Move, move! I'm so sorry. It's okay. His name's Alexander. He's 13 in this picture. The day after he was born, I overheard the last name of the adoptive parents. And I hunted them down. And I found them. And I begged them to keep me updated on how he was doing. He's really good at math. I was hoping that one day you'd be ready. For years, they complied. Soon after his 13th birthday, they stopped all communication. You had been doing so well in rebuilding your life, that I was worried that if I told you, that maybe I would lose you. I just didn't know if you'd be able to take it. It was years of lying. Years and years. That it became, it became so hard to tell you the truth. Eventually, I realized that no matter how this thing played out, you and I would never be the same again. I love you so much.
