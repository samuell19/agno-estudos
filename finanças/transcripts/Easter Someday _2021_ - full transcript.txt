[upbeat music] [film roll rattling] [upbeat music] [dramatic music] - [Narrator] Many moons ago. There was a man who found a book on a dusty road on the edge of town. There was nothing special about the book. In fact, all the pages were completely blank. But for some reason, it seemed to call to him. So he picked it up and carried it to his home where he lived alone. It is said that on the night of a full moon while holding the book the man made a wish to be with his true love who had sailed to the other side of the world with her family. The next morning, nothing was left in the house but the book. Over the years, several curious children ventured into the man's house and vanished forever. The townspeople responded with burning the house down. The book, they say, remained inside. They call it The Book of Wishes. Be careful what you wish for. [dramatic music] ♪ All I want is a long time in bed ♪ Dreaming 'til noon - [Father] Ava. Ava. I got your report card today. Now you know what I'm about to say. Ah, don't talk. Just listen.

Real talk. - Yup, your daddy's right. - None of my friends have to do this. - That's the point. - Honey, you will understand one day, but until then just remember this.

Ava. Ava. [suspenseful music] Book of Wishes. Welcome to your wish come true. The book will tell you what to do. [suspenseful music] - Help. Help. Help. I just wanna go home. [soft dramatic music] It's so cold. [soft dramatic music] [whimsical music] - What gwan? You look very familiar. - Hi. I think I'm lost. - Me disagree. You look like someone who's right where she wanted to be. - I don't understand. - [Coralia] What's your name, child? - My name is Ava. - Ava. My name is Coralia. It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too, Coralia. - Tell me your story. - I don't remember. - Try. - Well, it's just that I don't know how I got here. - What's the last thing you remember? - Well, I was sleeping and then I woke up in this house and there's this book and the book led me to this door and the door led me to here. I just wanna go home. - Sweetheart. Everything has a solution. If you focus on the problem, you will never get to the solution and you will be stuck here forever. So, let's take a deep breath. And let's try to figure this thing out together. What's the last thing you remember? - I don't remember. - Try, sweetheart. Think really, really hard. - I was mad because I didn't want to go to bed early. So I read my parents a bedtime story. - You read them a bedtime story? - They're super weird. Don't ask. So then it was a full moon and I went to my window. - What was on your windowsill? - I don't know. Some toys. - What kind of toys? - Some beads and a bunny rabbit. - What kind of bunny? - It was something. It's kind of hard to describe, but it was something that I found and just kept and it had big ears and a fluffy nose. - Oh no, that's not good. - What do you mean that's not good? - I need you to think very hard. The next question I'm going to ask you is very important. What did you do with that money? Did you wish for anything before going to bed? - No, not that I remember, but I know I didn't ask to be trapped in some house with trick doors and a talking book. - Okay. Let's try something. Give me your hands. Close your eyes. [whimsical music] - [All] I got it. I remember now. I wished to be someplace else. Someplace cool. [gentle music] - So can you help me? - Yes. But I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is I can help you get home. - Wow. Thank you so much. - The bad news is I can only tell you how to get home. You will have to take the journey by yourself in order to reverse your wish. I cannot go with you. - Why is this happening to me? How is all of this possible? I mean, where am I? - This place has no name really. Most folks just call it Someplace Someday. - Someplace Someday? - It's pretty simple really. That bunny you touched is a wish granter. If you make a wish on the night of a full moon, it will take you exactly where you asked to be. - But this isn't what I asked for. - You asked to be someplace else. Someplace cool. So here you are. - Can you please just help me get home? - I can only tell you what to do. You must make the journey by yourself. You must follow the Rabbit King and collect three golden eggs. The Book of Wishes is going to take you to magical doors where you will face very difficult challenges. You must follow these steps exactly. It's going to be very hard and you might face some hobgoblins along the way. - Hobgoblins? - Half human, half rabbit. All evil. The best thing I can do is give you this necklace. Take it and wear it at all times. You can hear my voice inside your head. Now go. Wait. I've never actually tried it. It can do some other stuff, too. Be careful. Wait. And the next thing I'm going to tell you is very, very important. If you do not collect all three golden eggs before sunset, you will be stuck here forever. Like me. [soft piano music] - [Ghost] Pink door. [soft piano music] [ominous music] [ominous music] [birds chirping] [ominous music continues] [birds chirping] - Coralia. Coralia. Please talk to me. - Girl, calm down. I'm just messing with ya. - That's not funny. - You must keep a sense of humor if you want to get through this thing. It won't be easy. Ava, did you ever think of just staying here? It's not so bad once you get used to it. You're the first friend I've had in a long time. You're pretty cool. - You're pretty cool, too, Coralia, but I have to get back home. My parents would miss me. - Okay. Well, let's focus then. Let's get started. Look around, child. Tell me what you see. - Nothing really but trees. - The Book of Wishes took you through the blue door first. That's rude. The book doesn't like you very much. - Like me? It has feelings? - Of course it has feelings. You must be nice to the book. Tell it good things. - I'll keep that in mind. - Okay. Focus, Ava. What do you see? - Wait. I see something. - What? What is it? - [Ava] It's like a white tree, but it's moving. Wait, it just disappeared. - Ava. What you just saw was the Rabbit King. Follow it. Keep very close. He's hiding the eggs. Stay on the trail and you must hurry. Your time is limited. - I know. Full moon. - Ava. - [Ava] Yes. - There's something I forgot to tell you. When you get close to the eggs, the magic of the necklace will disappear. Me not gon' be able to talk to you. - Wait, but how will I know what to do? Coralia. Coralia. [upbeat music] Coralia. Coralia, I need help. Please talk to me. Coralia. [bright music] [soft dramatic music] [stairs creaking] [soft dramatic music] An attitude of gratitude is the key to a happy life. Okay. Hi, Mr. or Mrs. Book. My name is Ava and I'm sorry that I didn't. I'm sorry that I wasn't nicer to you earlier. And I'm a really nice person when you need to know me. It's just that, well, I really need to get back home and I know I have to collect two more eggs, but if you don't mind, will you send me somewhere safer this time? - [Ghost] Blue door. [bright music] [eerie music] [gentle music] [soft dramatic music] [soft dramatic music] [man mumbling] - [Guardian] On this, Steve, you made a wish. Now that wish came true. The golden egg you seek. What I say, you will do. Do you accept the challenge? - Huh? Where did you say? - Do you accept? A girl? A girl? They really brought? No. No. Wait. Did anyone follow you here? - No, I don't think so. - You came here alone? What is your name? - Ava. - Ava. I think we can both help each other out. You need the egg, right? - Yes. - Okay. I'm not allowed to give it to you. You need to solve this riddle. You see, I've been here stranded here for years. Now. The people that have come here to visit me to solve these riddles, they don't make it. They turn into these stones. I need you. When I tell you the riddle, I need you to please listen carefully. Listen to every word. And then we both can get out of here and I can see my family again. Are you ready? Do you accept my challenge? - Yes. - All right. [soft dramatic music] Give me the answer I beg and you will get the chosen egg. - [Ava] Okay. - I could cut you, but I'm quite comfortable. I can be green or yellow. Short or stiff. Or soft. I'm a family and friends to bugs of all kinds and to bare feet. What am I? You have 10 seconds, by the way. 10, nine, eight. - Wait, I need more time. I really don't wanna get- [speaking in foreign language] - Three. Two. One. - Is it a blade of grass? - Is that your final answer? - [Ava] Yes, that's my final answer. - I'm sorry, child. [ominous music] Ava, you have saved us. You saved our family. I can finally go home now. Thank you. [soft dramatic music] Be safe. [soft dramatic music] [ominous music] [whimsical music] [soft dramatic music] [gentle music] [gentle music continues] - Are you there? - [Coralia] I can hear you. Where are you now? - It looks like I'm somewhere with branches and cows. - [Coralia] Any sign of our friend? - Not this time, but there is a lot of white fur. - Okay, that makes sense. The challenge gets tougher as you get closer to your goal. In times like this, you must trust your instincts. - My instinct? - Yes, instinct. Your gut. What does your gut tell you to do? - My gut is telling me I'm hungry. - Take a big smell. Do you smell something sweet? Does the cotton field look like candy? Take a little bite. It might be cotton candy, but don't eat too much because you might have to run or jump or do something crazy and you never know. - Coralia. - Yes. - This whole place runs on magic, right? - I suppose you can say that. - So, can I use magic? - [Coralia] It takes centuries of practice. I don't think you want to stay that long, do you? - Come on, just teach me one. - [Coralia] Okay. Close your eyes. I don't think they're closed. - How did you know? - Nobody ever closes them on the first time. Now listen to me. The key to channeling magic is to believe. You have to believe that the magic exists within you. If you can do that, you can do anything. Ava. Do you believe? How many trees do you see? - Nothing. My eyes are closed. - [Coralia] Believe. Believe that you can see with your eyes closed. Believe that the magic exists within you. Believe. - Oh, it's no use. It's not working. - Don't worry, little one. When the time is right, it will. - What was your wish? - [Coralia] I beg your pardon. - I mean. How did you end up in Someplace Someday? - We should focus on getting you out of this thing. Don't you think? - Well, you know everything about me, but I don't know anything about you. - [Coralia] I wished to be a mermaid. - But you're not a mermaid. - Technically I am. When I was a little girl, people used to make fun of me because I couldn't swim. I always felt like they were talking behind my back, so one night during a full moon I wished I could be a mermaid that could read minds. Turns out mermaids only have tails when they are in the ocean. On dry land, their tails become legs. And if they stay away from the ocean too long, their tails disappear forever. But in the ocean, the only minds read are those of dolphins. I wish to read people's minds. So my wish was granted in the most accurate way possible sending me to a small town in Someplace Someday. Read people's minds someday. - So that's how you know about all these challenges? - [Coralia] Yes. The Book of Wishes led me through the challenges and told me to go get three golden eggs. I got the first two, but I failed to get the third one. So here I am. - That's really sad. - It's okay, little one. If I weren't here, I wouldn't be able to help you. The way I see it, I'm right where I need to be. I'm truly glad I met you. - Glad that I met you, too, Coralia. [gentle music] Hey, is there any way I can get an extra wish? - Whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves. You need to keep your eye on the prize. - Come on. I want more than just one wish. I only have one and now I want two. - No, no, no. That won't be necessary. - Well. - You can get an extra wish by catching the Rabbit King by his tail while in possession of the golden egg. You have to make your wish while holding his tail. But. - But? - [Coralia] But you will have to get past the hobgoblins. - Hobgoblins? - Yes, the mean, ugly creatures. Ears like a rabbit. Teeth like a wolf. Body like a human. They will tear you to bits if they get a chance. Take it from me, kid. Find your last golden egg. Go home and forget about this place. It's not worth the risk. - I see something. - [Coralia] Is it the Rabbit King? - [Ava] Yes. - Follow him. Don't lose the trail. [bright music] - I lost it. I found his trail, but then he just disappeared. Coralia, I need help. Coralia. [soft dramatic music] Coralia. Coralia. Coralia. Coralia, please respond to me. - Why are your children so loud? [chuckles] No need to fear, Ava. I'm just an old man with a beard. - How do you know my name? - Why, the Rabbit King told me. Said you were coming to purchase something from me. - Purchase something? - [Wizard] Yes. - Purchase what? - Purchase that. [whimsical music] Ah, ah. [man laughing] [bright music] Ava, nothing in life is free. Not even in Someplace Someday. Now, come with me. You play fair with me and I play fair with you. We'll play a simple game of tag. You tag me in less than 20 seconds and I will give you the egg. [bright music] - Okay. - All right. Is that a deal? - Yes. - Good. - What are you doing? - Why I'm setting the timer of course. On your mark. Get set. Go. - Hey, no fair. You didn't tell me you could do that. - You didn't ask. Tick tock. [soft dramatic music] Are you getting tired already? You'll never catch me like that. Tick tock. [soft dramatic music] A deal is a deal. The egg is yours. - Thank you. - Have a safe trip home. [bright music] - There you are. [bright music] I got you now. [bright music] [soft dramatic music] [hobgoblins screaming] [upbeat music] - We don't like nobody messing with the Rabbit King. - [Hobgoblins] We don't play that. - [Hobgoblin 1] It's time to bite. - It's time to claw. - It's time to scratch. - [Hobgoblin 2] It's time to maul. - It's time we feast. - On a strange new beast. - That's you. - You. - [Hobgoblins] That's you. Get her. [suspenseful music] [hobgoblins growling] [girl screaming] [dramatic music] - Ava. Ava, can you hear me? Ava, wake up, child. Ava. - I did it, Coralia. I caught the Rabbit King and I got an extra wish. - I can see that. I'm not sure how but. - I used magic just like you taught me. The magic was inside of me. And my extra wish is for you. I want to you enjoy your someday and be that mermaid you always wished to be. You're my best friend and I'm gonna miss you. [somber music] - I'm gonna miss you, too. - [Ava] Are we ever gonna see each other again? - Always. Course you will. Every night there's a full moon, just listen for my voice. [clock ringing] Oh no, that's the alarm. Ava, you must go. Go now or you'll be trapped here forever. You must escape before dawn. [soft dramatic music] [clock ringing] Go. You must go through that door. Hurry. [soft dramatic music] [clock ringing] Hurry. [soft dramatic music] [clock ringing] - Come on, don't do this to me now. I thought we were friends. An attitude of gratitude. An attitude of gratitude. An attitude of gratitude. Listen, I'm sorry that I wasn't nicer to you earlier, but we're kids and we do dumb stuff like that, but I finished all the stuff I had to do. What more do you want from me? [soft dramatic music] [clock ticking] Make my wish? Make my wish. Of course. I wish I was at home with my parents. [soft dramatic music] [peaceful music] Hey, Coralia. How's someday treating you? [peaceful music] - Well, I definitely miss you, but other than that it's a wish come true. [peaceful music] [gentle music] - [Narrator] And that is how one special girl made it home against all odds, but although Ava's story has the happiest of endings, every day in every town, a foolish wish is made. Until the next full moon, my friends. The Book of Wishes waits. [gentle music] [upbeat music] - Hi, Mr. or Mrs. Book. My name is Ava. And I'm sorry that I didn't. I'm sorry that I wasn't nicer to you earlier. - If you focus on the problem, you will never get to the solution. In times like this, you must trust your instincts. - No need to fear, Ava. I'm just an old man with a beard. Why, the Rabbit King told me. Said you were coming to purchase something from me. - I could cut you, but I'm quite comfortable. I can be green or yellow. Short or stiff. - Honey, you will understand one day, but until then, just remember this. That an attitude of gratitude is the key to a happy life. - Nice try. Tomorrow is Easter Sunday. And your grandparents wanna see you in church. [upbeat music] - [Hobgoblins] We don't like nobody messing with the Rabbit King. We don't play that. Get her.
