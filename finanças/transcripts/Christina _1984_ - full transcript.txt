(upbeat dance music) [Narrator] Meet Christina Von Belle, unquestionably one of the world's richest women and also one of the most controversial. Heiress to an immense fortune, head of a worldwide publishing empire, Christina is seldom out of the news. Hello? (laughing) [Narrator] Tell me, Miss Von Belle, how does it feel to already possess what most people dream about? It can be rather boring. [Narrator] And what do you dream about? That's my secret. [Narrator] But you must have certain preferences. Confidentially, I like men. (seagulls squawking) And they like me too. (upbeat music) [Narrator] Christina believes in exposing the facts, the bare facts, and quite frequently, the naked truth. (upbeat music) (exciting beat music) Wherever she goes and whatever she does, Christina makes the headlines. It isn't my fault. All I want is a quiet life and a few rags to wear and a man to use me and amuse me. (exciting beat music) (airplane engine rumbling) [Narrator] The ultimate jet setter, Christina doesn't always fly a jet, but she does believe in a fast takeoff. From London to Los Angeles, from Pago Pago to Paris is the world for Christina Von Belle. You'll be seeing more of me soon. (laughing) In the south of France. [Narrator] What will Christina be up to next? (car honking) Hey, Christina! (tires screeching) (honking) (exciting beat music) (giggling) (honking) (honking) (tires squealing) (honking) (tires screeching) (exciting beat music) (tires squealing) Oh my gosh, Christina. What in the world are you doing? Christina, please, not now! Oh Patrick. You know, it's been so long and this is no way to renew our friendship. What happened back there anyway? I realize young men today can't drive like us girls. Hang on a minute. It was all your fault. You know I was gaining and you wouldn't move over. (gasping) Oh shit, my head hurts. Help me up, love. Oh, you better take it easy now. (groaning) You did get quite a shock. I will, Christina, darling. Then perhaps you join me for dinner at my villa. It's not far from here. In the meantime, maybe you would consent to teaching me a few of your latest techniques. You know, since your driving has improved out of all recognition since we last met. However, I continue our drive since I was winning! [Christina] You son of a bitch! (laughing) (exciting music) Christina, where have you been? That is apart from the front pages of the magazines and society columns. Involved with a different jet setter every day. Jealous? Perhaps. A little jealous. I really have missed you. No kidding. And the way we parted last time, it was really heavy. I know. I was sick for weeks. Days, anyway. But now we're back together. So let's forget the past, shall we? (sensual beat music) (waves sloshing) You know, 12 months is a long time. Christina. I've got a lot of lost time to catch up on. (sensual beat music) I need to explore your lovely body inch by inch. After all that exercise, you deserve a reward. (laughing) I'd be just delighted. The least I can do is give you a dinner at the villa. Let's go. Exercise always gives me an apatite. (water sloshing) [Patrick] Christina! Your room is ready. Oh, I love this place. I'm coming. You're always coming. (giggling) Let's go have dinner. Okay. Come and meet my friends. Patrick, where have you been? We were ready to call the police. You've been gone so long. As a matter of fact, I had a slight car accident. But I was rescued and received first aid from this lovely ghost from my past. We were just getting to know each other again while I was getting my strength back. Obviously the medicine worked. Dear Brigitte, always ready with a merry quip. Christina, this is Brigitte, one of the seven wonders of the film world. French style, of course. And this is Max, who, having married into a gasoline empire, decided to carry one a single-handed battle to keep them in business. And this, my friends, I presume you already know her, is Christina Von Belle, the so-called "Playgirl of the Western World." Listen, I'm starving, let's get dressed for dinner. That's a very good idea. Would you rather have a drink first? No, I'd rather have a nice warm bath. See you later. (boat whistling blowing) Oh, sweetheart, this is a really beautiful place. Do you wanna sell it? Well, you can, shall we say, invest in it. I hope you don't do this down there. I have a feeling she thinks you're her property. I'm not anyone's property anymore than you are, darling. Suppose I wanna touch Max or something. Silly. Are you jealous again? (laughing) You really should pay more attention when you're conquering men, my dear. Get ready, let's eat. (ocean waves sloshing) (sensual music) (foreboding music) (muffled screaming) (menacing music) (groaning) (whimpering) Patrick, help! John, get something to tie this creep up, so we can find out what the hell he wants! Who are you and what do you want? Who the hell are you?! John, perhaps we need some first aid. Go and get me the knife. Wait, you guys don't know how to be polite. You have to ask nicely. Now, my friend, I'm sorry we weren't formally introduced. But let's cut the shit, shall we? I don't want you to think I'm after revenge. After all, we wouldn't want to hurt the pretty, little things, now would we? I'm Emily. I'm with the Tenth of November group. I'll talk if you let me go. I don't wanna die or anything else. You amaze me. John, tie her up, will you? Then arm the rest of the staff, post a guard and notify the police. I'll contact the company and arrange for proper security. This lady came solo and her game is up. Take her downstairs and lock her up, John. How about dinner? Oh yeah. Let's go then. (thudding) [John] She got away! (crickets chirping) (water splashing) Busy day, busy night. Don't worry, I'll make sure you get enough exercise to work off those excess calories. So Christina, am I still a Cordon Bleu chef? Yes and your touch is better than ever. Okay, John, I'll take care of all this. Offer the gentleman a cigar. Yes, sir. I really must congratulate you, Patrick. The meal was superb. Thank you. Not to appear rude, however, when do we leave? We leave tomorrow evening, early. We'll have a swim or siesta after lunch and we should arrive in Monte Carlo in time for a late dinner. Thank you. So relax and enjoy yourself. You're well protected here. I don't know how she got in, but no one else will. That I can assure you. Tell me a bit more about that new car design. Do you want a race winner that's adaptable for road use as well? How will you work that? No, I don't want a mass production in any way. I want a market leader catering to people in the upper class, people like us. All you need is money, right? Forgive me being naive, but why don't you just use your own? What do you need Max's for? Well, it's not that easy Brigitte. Most of the family's money is earmark for expansion. On the technical side, robot-controlled computers and any other thing that will keep the Japs from eating us alive. You know, competition is ferocious today. You really gotta stay ahead of the other guy. (sensual music) I think we should retire. It's been a long day. Come on, the night is still young. (laughing) Woooo. Hey. (beat music) (laughing) (jazzy beat music) (Christina laughing) (laughing) (jazzy music) (girls giggling) (laughing) I think we should have a sauna and maybe relax. That's great. How about a sauna? (steam sizzling) I think I'll sit cross-wise. Me too. I'm fine, dear. (somber music) (moaning) I'm so hot in here. We gotta leave. Yeah. That sounds like a pretty good idea. (fire crackling) (sensual beat music) (sexual moaning) Max, get me a drink. (sensual beat music) (clock chiming) (ocean waves sloshing) Your morning coffee, nice and hot, just as you like it, madame. Thank you, John. You certainly are prepared for anything. You know, I have an urge to go out riding. A horse, I mean. You think that could be arranged? Everything, so far as you're concerned, can be arranged. Might I suggest, too, that accompany you jut for protection. Monsieur Patrick would never forgive me if something should happen to you. Oh, no, no. I'll follow you at a distance. You will be entirely alone. Okay, I guess that would be all right. (somber beat music) (ocean waves sloshing) (horse neighing) Oooo. Go! (motor revving) (horse hooves clapping) (motor revving) (horse squealing) (whimpering) I got you, bitch! [Christina Voiceover] I always dream in black and white. I find it so becoming. The trouble with this particular dream was that it started turning into a nightmare. (eerie music) Hands that wouldn't leave me alone. Hands without people. Without faces. A mystery without a solution. When I finally came to my senses, I found myself in a difficult situation. I was all tied up, a condition I strongly dislike. But after I had managed to set myself free, another problem remained. Where was I? I decided to try and find a way out. (eerie music) (thudding) (unsettling music) [Echoing Female Voices] Christina! Christina! Christina! (eerie music) Christina! (menacing music) Christina! Christina! Christina! Christina! (whimpering) [Christina Voiceover] Everything went black again and white. These same hands were attacking me, but more, many more. In a very intimate way, I was aroused. However hard I fought, they wouldn't leave me alone. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't make up my mind. Was I terrified or ecstatic? (eerie music) My mind was already being made up for me, though I didn't realize it yet. The boss of the gang, into whose hands I had fallen, had arrived to collect me. (eerie music) Her name was Rosa. Next to her, Frankenstein looked like a friend. What's going on here? It's like walking into a brothel. Now let's not get upset. We don't want any misunderstanding. Shut up. The fact that you helped us get Christina doesn't allow you to speak if not spoken to. So just shut up. What about the blonde girl, the American? What do we do with her? She is not just a blonde girl. This wine is shit! She is a treasure! She is a gold mine! Let me just tell you, he stupid father, I mean, Mr. Von Belle, is going to pay a lot. And I mean a lot for Christina. So go and get her. Make it snappy. I can not stand this violence around here. It's just too much for me. What would we do without you, John? And what would you do without us? Thank you Madame Rosa. Did you know I am always at your disposal? Very good. Ah, they're coming. (Christina whimpering) Go easy on her, girls. All right, Christina, be a nice girl and be quiet. I'm sorry, Miss Von Belle. But please, behave yourself. Don't make it more difficult than it is. [Christina] John, where am I? You're hurting me. I'm terribly sorry, Miss Von Belle, but you are quite kidnapped, actually. Kidnapped? How vulgar. Our delicious heiress, the darling of her magazine readers, a member of the jet setter, who stays in the best hotels in the whole world. She will be our guest. Our first class guest. (Christina whimpering) The Tenth of November group, to which we all belong, is going to put a nice prize one her. A very nice prize for our precious little Christina. We are modernizing our business and you've got no idea, Miss Von Belle, how expensive everything is now. For instance, you know how much it costs to bring you to these islands? [Woman] It's here! Okay, the helicopter's arriving. Let's go everybody. It's time now, let's go. (helicopter whizzing) (gasping) Don't be a fool, Christina. (women yelling) (helicopter whizzing) I want you all to meet Christina Von Belle. We want you to take extremely good care of her. My dear, we are the ultimate in woman liberation. Well, that's nice, but don't you find it a little inconvenient at times. You know, men do have their uses. We are different. We are superior. Let's show our guest how superior we can be and I have a little reward in mind too. These two women shall fight now until one is victorious. The winner shall be the personal guard of our lovely guest for one night. Now follow me. Damn you! I'm not a prize, I'm a person! You've got a big mouth! You think you're superior. Underneath, you're like us! But you'll never equal us! (gasping) Begin! Go on! (women yelling) (groaning) (women cheering) (screaming) Come on! Get her! Get her! (women cheering) (groaning) (applauding) Congratulations, Marie. Here's your prize. That was quite a show, wasn't it, my girls? (water sloshing) (sensual music) Let me help you with that. After all, I'm your guardian angel. (sensual saxophone music) You are very beautiful. Thanks. I must have you. No. No, please don't. Don't worry, Christina. After this, you'll never want a man again. (sensual beat music) (sexual moaning) [Christina Voiceover] I passed out again and this time I experienced a new sensation. (ominous music) I've always liked high-powered automobiles. They have a peculiar affect on me. Like sex, I find them very stimulating. The touch of the breaks and then the accelerator. Woo. (ominous music) Whenever I hear the roar of a powerful engine, I respond very quickly. (eerie music) (sensual jazz music) Will I see you again? No. We're not allowed to travel. That's exactly what I mean. You're just as much of a prisoner as I am. Oh God, I need to be free. Will you please help me? Hey, you! Why don't you help her escape? Sounds like a good idea to you, doesn't it? Go to hell, Antoinette! You lost the battle. I won because I am superior. (groaning) (thudding) Hold it! (thudding) (whimpering) (groaning) All of you, this is an order! What's going here? I want answers now! I overheard them talking about escaping. Christina got Marie to help her. I followed them. That's a lie! Shut up, prisoner. What's your story, Marie? Christina tried to talk me into helping her. I'll deal with you later. So, Christina, you still foolish enough to want to escape? You need stronger attention. I think Antoinette will escort you back to your quarters. Until I summon you this evening for further questioning, take her away. (whimpering) (clock chiming) Let's go! Come on! Christina, my dear, you know you didn't have to behave the way you did today, trying to convince a little naive thing like Marie to help you escape. It was silly, wasn't it? You really think I'd ever want to leave this wonderful place? My you are a feisty little thing. Still on the defensive. Seems that the ransom negotiations aren't going very well. You might be with us for a very long time. So are you going to rape me now or later? Now, Christina, why wait? Let me tell you how you can even enjoy your stay with us. There are certain special privileges which are available for a select few. And who selects the select? I do. In return for certain agreements, of course. Of course. (ominous music) Don't be silly. You really mustn't, you know. Privileges, Christina. Everything at Château Rosa must be earned. But anything one desires is available. Oh well, in that case, I guess I'll have champagne and caviar and a Learjet out of here. We are not interested in material things, love. Just in you. (sensual music) (gasping) [Christina Voiceover] Then came that same sensation. But more powerful. Oh, much more. Almost too powerful for my abused senses to take. (eerie music) (moaning) "Christina," I said, "Control yourself." (eerie music) But I couldn't. Someone else had taken the wheel. (sexual moaning) I was just a passenger. I couldn't make up my mind whether I wanted to get out or in. (ominous music) I realized, now, that I had a love, hate relationship with my captor. I either needed her desperately, (groaning) or desperately needed to kick the hell out of here! (dog barking) (groaning) (yelling) (whimpering) (exciting beat music) (giggling) (ocean waves sloshing) (laughing) (giggling) (popping) (laughing) Oh, the life of a prisoner. I feel almost free. And you'll leave me, I know it, and I'll miss you. It's not often we have someone like you around here. Don't take it for granted. Next time, ask first. How about right now? (ominous music) (water sloshing) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) (groaning) Come here! (yelling) You bitch! (splashing) Who are you? What do you want? We're smugglers, miss. We were ordered to pick you up by our boss, Mr. Alain. You're gonna meet him. Oh no. Oh yes. There's a big ransom, you know. You mean you didn't pick me up to save me? Are you kidding? You're kidnapping me? This is unbelievable. (groaning) You expect me to thank you. Calm down, now. Try to understand. We're asking a lot of money. We don't mean to do you any harm, okay? (sensual saxophone music) [Christina Voiceover] I black out again. I was getting used to my world of fantasy. And this time my dream was almost normal. It must've been those sailors. Smugglers or not, they were still men. And I hadn't seen a man in weeks. What did they say their boss' name was? Alain? I wondered what he looked like. And what his plans were for me. I was getting real excited. Oh, but then I excited it was time to wake up. (sensual saxophone music) (boat motor puttering) (ocean water sloshing) (giggling) (cork popping) (elegant music) To a beautiful evening with a beautiful girl. To freedom. To a beautiful girl's freedom. It's not often that I dine with thieves and smugglers who are such artists in the kitchen. We're not all the same. Christina. Christina. You see, smuggling is really a form of commerce. We simply act according to the laws of supply and demand. And what circumstances justify stealing? Well, you see by these surroundings that I, like you, enjoy the good life. But unlike you, I did not inherit my fortune. I earned it. So, like Robin Hood, I rob from the rich to help the poor. My father had opposite opinions. Let's cut the crap, shall we? Presumably you have demanded a ransom for my company. Negotiations have begun. And when do I leave? When the negotiations are completed. (somber music) Make the best of it, Christina. You always did know how to make a good time out of the worst party. You like it? Absolutely superb. You can get a job as a chef after you get out of jail. The wages are too low. The work is too hard and there are no French benefits. And besides, I would rather eat with you than serve you. Tell me, what else do pirates like? Oh, by the way, the article about me in your magazine doesn't do me justice. Shouldn't we finish eating? All this art and talent would be wasted. I have other talents to show you. You do? Yes. And none of them are printable. (dramatic music) (sexual moaning) (smacking) (moaning) (laughing) (gasping) (pleasant music) When everything is ready, we'll go ashore. Okay? Hi. Good morning. Where are we? That's the island of Majorca. Are you goin ashore? Are you planning to escape? (giggling) The thought never crossed my mind. Well that's just as well. You wouldn't stand a chance. I can count on every person in that little village. I won't try to escape. They're all my allies. They'd never betray me. Can I go? Of course, my dear. (laughing) (waves sloshing) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (exciting Spanish music) (man singing in foreign language) (applauding) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (applauding) I propose a toast. To beauty and money. To love and smuggling. To all of those in huge quantities. (laughing) May I ask you to dance? Why do you want to dance with me? Oh, because I know you from the magazines and I think you are the most beautiful woman in the world. Ah. It's the truth. What a nice thing to say. Of course I'll dance with you. But Christina, he's just a baby. A virgin, for God's sake. (laughing) (pleasant music) Don't mind them. They're just a little drunk and they forget how difficult it is to be young. And you've lived here all your life? My parents are shepherds so they live in the mountains. And do you want to be a shepherd? Oh no. I'm going to Madrid to be a famous singer. You seem awfully sure about that. Absolutely. If you make up your mind about something, you feel strongly enough, then it will happen. I hope you're right. So far it hasn't worked out for me. I'm still a prisoner. Do you want to escape from those people? Oh, you can say that again. Think you can help me? (upbeat music) Hey, honey. You lousy son-of-a-bitch! (thudding) (people yelling) Stop it everybody! We're all friends here. (banging) (exciting beat music) Get up! Get up off the floor! We've gotta go up that mountain. I'm not exactly dressed for climbing. Don't worry, I know a secret passage we can use. But where we gonna go? There's a hut with food and drink. And we can sleep there also. And in the morning? The road to Palma is just on the other side of that mountain. Oh freedom, here I come! (church bells ringing) (exciting beat music) Have you seen a young foreigner? With a boy? You know, the singer? Pablo, that kid? He's with the girl. (laughing) You'll never find them. He knows every inch of these mountains. Where did they go? Palma road, I think. Over the other side. What about the other road along the coast? We could cut them off. Come on, let's go! Crazy foreigners. [Woman] They're all the same. (seagulls squawking) (groaning) We will spend the night here. It's not much of a place. It's okay to me. Like a five star hotel. (sighing) (fire crackling) Would you like some wine? Oh please, I'm so thirsty. Yeah, me too. (cork popping) (fire crackling) Mmmm. (giggling) (ominous music) To my beautiful dream girl, Christina. You know, you've been so nice to me. (dramatic music) After all, what're dream girls for? (sensual music) (fire crackling) Come on, that's the road to Palma. (motor revving) Any luck? They have to come this way, it's the only road to Palma. Not down there. (motors revving) They'll either have to walk or catch a ride and then we'll get them. Let's look some more, further up the road. Step on it! Sorry, sir, could you take us to Palma, please? We have a problem. Si, si. Jump in the back. No problem. (engine rattling) (motor bikes revving) I tell you, we've gotta find them! We've got to stop them, damn it! If they get to Palma they'll tell the police. You keep moving. Get going fast! (motors revving) Oh my god, I'm free at last. (laughing) Oh, it's Alain! Tell him to drive very fast. Faster! Faster! Please. What did he say? Son of a bitch, he says he won't drive faster. Oh, let me drive! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (laughing) (suspenseful music) So much vegetables. I'm sorry. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (motor revving) (tires screeching) Well, Mr. Alain, I see. I hope you enjoy your stay in Majorca. It will be a long one. I promise you. Okay, put the cuffs on him. Oh my god, are you the one and only Miss Belle? Oh yes. I want to thank you for all this hospitality. You truly saved us. (laughing) Oh, nothing. I want to that you for your hospitality. But in the future you must be much nicer. Bitch. Bastard. (laughing) (dramatic beat music) Excuse me, but Miss Von Belle has just arrived. Okay people, Christina's just arrived. (laughing) Oh. Oh, Max. Christina. How are you? This is my savior, Pablo. Hey, Pablo! (laughing) He saved my life. [Max] Let's have a party! Yeah! Okay! (party commotion) (beat music) Ladies and gentlemen, friends, guests, today we're here to celebrate the return of our beloved Christina. She is as beautiful as ever. (laughing) So celebrate we shall. The party will carry on for 24 hours and then, if necessary, we'll start all over again. Hey! I want to propose a toast to freedom, hell, happiness, and lots of love. Hey. (laughing) (dramatic beat music) Well, let's start the party. Yes! (exciting dance music) [Narrator] The world of Christina Von Belle has already provided inspiration for over 40 international best sellers. Christina, herself, is busily at work on a screenplay for her next film, both writing it and living it. She'll be back again soon with another exciting adventure. (exciting beat music)
